Recentinterest in cross-linguistic studies of discourserelations has led to the initiation of similar dis-course annotation projects in other languages aswell, such as Chinese (Xue, 2005), Czech (Mla-dov?
et al, 2008), and Turkish (Deniz and Web-ber, 2008).
In this paper, we describe our ongo-ing work on the creation of a Hindi DiscourseRelation Bank (HDRB), broadly following theapproach of the PDTB.1 The size of the HDRBcorpus is 200K words and it is drawn from a400K word corpus on which Hindi syntactic de-pendency annotation is being independently con-ducted (Begum et al, 2008).
Source corpus textsare taken from the Hindi newspaper Amar Ujala,and comprise news articles from several do-mains, such as politics, sports, films, etc.
We1 An earlier study of Hindi discourse connectives towardsthe creation of HDRB is presented in Prasad et al (2008).present our characterization of discourse connec-tives and their arguments in Hindi (Section 2),our proposals for modifying the sense classifica-tion scheme (Section 3), and present some cross-linguistics comparisons based on annotationsdone so far (Section 4).
Section 5 concludes witha summary and future work.2 Discourse Relations and ArgumentsFollowing the PDTB approach, we take dis-course relations to be realized in one of threeways: (a) as explicit connectives, which are?closed class?
expressions drawn from well-defined grammatical classes; (b) as alternativelexicalizations (AltLex), which are non-connective expressions that cannot be defined asexplicit connectives; and (c) as implicit connec-tives, which are implicit discourse relations ?in-ferred?
between adjacent sentences not related byan explicit connective.
When no discourse rela-tion can be inferred between adjacent sentences,either an entity-based coherence relation (calledEntRel) or the absence of a relation (called No-Rel) is marked between the sentences.
The twoabstract object relata of a discourse relation arecalled the relation?s arguments (named Arg1 andArg2), and argument annotation follows the ?mi-nimality principle?
in that only as much is se-lected as the argument text span as is minimallynecessary to interpret the relation.
Finally, eachdiscourse relation is assigned a sense label basedon a hierarchical sense classification.2.1 Explicit ConnectivesIn addition to the three major grammaticalclasses of Explicit connectives in the PDTB ?subordinating conjunctions, coordinating con-junctions, and adverbials ?
we recognize threeother classes, described below.Sentential Relatives: These are relative pro-nouns that conjoin a relative clause with its ma-trix clause.
As the name suggests, only relativesthat modify verb phrases are treated as discourseconnectives, and not those that modify nounphrases.

?2.2 Arguments of Discourse RelationsIn the PDTB, the assignment of the Arg1 andArg2 labels to a discourse relation?s arguments issyntactically driven, in that the Arg2 label is as-2 Subordinators that denote the manner of an action are notdiscourse connectives, but since such disambiguation is adifficult task, we have decided to annotate subordinators ina later phase of the project.signed to the argument with which the connec-tive was syntactically associated, while the Arg1label is assigned to the ?other?
argument.
InHDRB, however, the Arg1/Arg2 label assign-ment is semantically driven, in that it is based onthe ?sense?
of the relation to which the argu-ments belong.
Thus, each sense definition for arelation specifies the sense-specific semantic roleof each of its arguments, and stipulates one of thetwo roles to be Arg1, and the other, Arg2.
Forexample, the ?cause?
sense definition, which in-volves a causal relation between two eventuali-ties, specifies that one of its arguments is thecause, while the other is the effect, and furtherstipulates that the cause will be assigned the labelArg2, while the effect will be assigned the labelArg1.
Apart from giving meaning to the argu-ment labels, our semantics-based convention hasthe added advantage simplifying the sense classi-fication scheme.
This is discussed further in Sec-tion 3.2.3 Implicit Discourse RelationsThe HDRB annotation of implicit discourse rela-tions largely follows the PDTB scheme.
The onlydifference is that while implicit relations inPDTB are annotated only between paragraph-internal adjacent sentences, we also annotatesuch relations across paragraph boundaries.3 Senses of Discourse RelationsBroadly, we follow the PDTB sense classifica-tion in that we take it to be a hierarchical classi-fication, with the four top level sense classes of?Temporal?, ?Contingency?, ?Comparison?, and?Expansion?.
Further refinements to the top classlevel are provided at the second type level andthe third subtype level.
Here, we describe ourpoints of departure from the PDTB classification.The changes are partly motivated by generalconsiderations for capturing additional senses,and partly by language-specific considerations.Figure 1 reflects the modifications we have madeto the sense scheme.
These are described below.Eliminating argument-specific labels: In thePDTB sense hierarchy, the tags at the type levelare meant to express further refinements of therelations?
semantics, while the tags at the subtypelevel are meant to reflect different orderings ofthe arguments (see Section 2.2).
In HDRB, weeliminate these argument-ordering labels fromthe subtype level, since these labels don?t direct-ly pertain to the meaning of discourse relations.All levels in the sense hierarchy thus have thepurpose of specifying the semantics of the rela-tion to different degrees of granularity.
The rela-tive ordering of the arguments is instead speci-fied in the definition of the type-level senses, andis inherited by the more refined senses at the sub-type level.Figure 1: HDRB (Modified) Sense ClassificationUniform treatment of pragmatic relations: Asin PDTB, discourse relations in HDRB arepragmatic when their relations have to be in-ferred from the propositional content of the ar-guments.
However, we replace the PDTB prag-matic senses with a uniform three-way classifica-tion.
Each pragmatic sense at the type level isfurther distinguished into three subtypes: ?epis-temic?
(Sweetser 1990), ?speech-act?
(Sweetser1990), and ?propositional?.
The propositionalsubtype involves the inference of a completeproposition.
The relation is then taken to holdbetween this inferred proposition and the propo-sitional content of one of the arguments.The ?Goal?
sense: Under the ?Contingency?class, we have added a new type ?Goal?, whichapplies to relations where the situation describedin one of the arguments is the goal of the situa-tion described in the other argument (whichenables the achievement of the goal).4 Initial Annotation ExperimentsBased on the guidelines as described in this pa-per, we annotated both explicit and implicit rela-tions in 35 texts (averaging approx.
250words/text) from the HDRB corpus.
A total of602 relation tokens were annotated.
Here wepresent some useful distributions we were able toderive from our initial annotation, and discussthem in light of cross-linguistic comparisons ofdiscourse relations.Types and Tokens of Discourse Relations: Ta-ble 1 shows the overall distribution of the differ-ent relation types, i.e., Explicit, AltLex, Implicit,EntRel, and NoRel.
The second column reportsthe number of unique expressions used to realizethe relation ?
Explicit, Implicit and AltLex ?while the third column reports the total numberof tokens and relative frequencies.Relations Types Tokens (%)Explicit 49 189 (31.4%)Implicit 35 185 (30.7%)AltLex 25 37 (6.14%)EntRel NA 140 (23.25%)NoRel NA 51 (8.5%)TOTAL 109 602Table 1: Distribution of Discourse RelationsThese distributions show some interesting simi-larities and differences with the PDTB distribu-tions (cf.
Prasad et al, 2008).
First, given thatHindi has a much richer morphological paradigmthan English; one would have expected that itwould have fewer explicit connectives.
That is,one might expect Hindi to realize discourse rela-tions morphologically more often than not, justas it realizes other syntactic relations.
However,even in the small data set of 602 tokens that wehave annotated so far, we have found 49 uniqueexplicit connectives, which is roughly half thenumber reported for the 1 million words anno-tated in English texts in PDTB.
It is expected thatwe will find more unique types as we annotateadditional data.
The relation type distributionthus seems to suggest that the availability ofricher morphology in a language doesn?t affectconnective usage.
Second, the percentage of Alt-Lex relations is higher in HDRB ?
6.14% com-pared to 1.5% in PDTB, suggesting that Hindimakes greater usage of non-connective cohesivelinks with the prior discourse.
Further studies areneeded to characterize the forms and functions ofAltLex expressions in both English and Hindi.Senses of Discourse Relations: We also ex-amined the distributions for each sense class inHDRB and computed the relative frequency ofthe relations realized explicitly and implicitly.Cross-linguistically, one would expect languagesto be similar in whether or not a relation with aparticular sense is realized explicitly or implicit-ly, since this choice lies in the domain of seman-tics and inference, rather than syntax.
Thus, wewere interested in comparing the sense distribu-tions in HDRB and PDTB.
Table 2 shows thesedistributions for the top class level senses.
(Herewe counted the AltLex relations together withexplicit connectives.
)Sense Class Explicit (%) Implicit (%)Contingency 57 (58.2%) 41 (41.8%)Comparison 68 (76.5%) 21 (23.5%)Temporal 43 (65.2%) 23 (34.8%)Expansion 64(40%) 94(60%)Table 2: Distribution of Class Level SensesThe table shows that sense distributions inHDRB are indeed similar to those reported in thePDTB (cf.
Prasad et al, 2008).

relations.5 Summary and Future WorkThis paper has reported on the Hindi DiscourseRelation Bank (HDRB) project, in which dis-course relations, their arguments, and theirsenses are being annotated.
A major goal of ourwork was to investigate how well the Penn Dis-course Treebank (PDTB) and its guidelines couldbe adapted for discourse annotation of Hinditexts.
To a large extent, we have successfullyadapted the PDTB scheme.
Proposed changeshave to do with identification of some new syn-tactic categories for explicit connectives, andsome general and language-driven modificationsto the sense classification.
From our initial anno-tations, we found that (a) there doesn?t seem tobe an inverse correlation between the usage fre-quency of explicit connectives and the morpho-logical richness of a language, although theredoes seem to be an increased use of cohesivedevices in such a language; and (b) sense distri-butions confirm the lack of expectation of cross-linguistic ?semantic?
differences.
Our future goalis to complete the discourse annotation of a 200Kword corpus, which will account for half of the400K word corpus being also annotated for syn-tactic dependencies.
We also plan to extend theannotation scheme to include attributions.AcknowledgementsThis work was partially supported by NSF grantsEIA-02-24417, EIA-05-63063, and IIS-07-05671.ReferencesRafiya Begum, Samar Husain, Arun Dhwaj, DiptiMisra Sharma, Lakshmi Bai, and Rajeev Sangal.2008.
