In thispaper, we describe the submissions made by team UniMelb-NLP, which took part in both theclosed and open categories.
We present the text representations and modeling techniques used,including cross-lingual POS tagging as well as fine-grained tags extracted from a deep grammarof English, and discuss additional data we collected for the open submissions, utilizing custom-built web corpora based on top-level domains as well as existing corpora.1 IntroductionLanguage identification (LangID) is the problem of determining what natural language a document iswritten in.
Studies in the area often report high accuracy (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994; Dunning, 1994;Grefenstette, 1995; Prager, 1999; Teahan, 2000).
However, recent work has shown that high accu-racy is only achieved under ideal conditions (Baldwin and Lui, 2010), and one area that needs furtherwork is accurate discrimination between closely-related languages (Ljube?si?c et al., 2007; Tiedemannand Ljube?si?c, 2012).
The problem has been explored for specific groups of confusable languages, suchas Malay/Indonesian (Ranaivo-Malancon, 2006), South-Eastern European languages (Tiedemann andLjube?si?c, 2012), as well as varieties of English (Lui and Cook, 2013), Portuguese (Zampieri and Gebre,2012), and Spanish (Zampieri et al., 2013).
The Discriminating Similar Language (DSL) shared task(Zampieri et al., 2014) was hosted at the VarDial workshop at COLING 2014, and brings together thework on these various language groups by proposing a task on a single dataset containing text from 13languages in 6 groups, drawn from a variety of news text datasets (Tan et al., 2014).In this paper, we describe the entries made by team UniMelb NLP to the DSL shared task.
We tookpart in both the closed and the open categories, submitting to the main component (Groups A-E) as wellas the separate English component (Group F).
For our closed submissions, we focused on comparing aconventional LangID methodology based on individual words and language-indicative letter sequences(Section 2.1) to a methodology that uses a de-lexicalized representation of language (Section 2.3).
ForGroups A-E we use cross-lingual POS-tagger adaptation (Section 2.3.1) to convert the raw text to aPOS stream using a per-group tagger, and use n-grams of POS tags as our de-lexicalized representation.For English, we also use a de-lexicalized representation based on lexical types extracted from a deepgrammar (Section 2.3.2), which can be thought of as a very fine-grained tagset.
For the open submissions,we constructed new web-based corpora using a standard methodology, targeting per-language top-leveldomains (Section 2.4.2).
We also compiled additional training data from existing corpora (Section 2.4.1).This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

In this section, we describe techniques and text representations that we tested, as well as theexternal data sources that we used to build language identifiers for this task.2.1 Language-Indicative Byte SequencesLui and Baldwin (2011) introduced the LD feature set, a document representation for LangID that isrobust to variation in languages across different sources of text.
The LD feature set can be thought of aslanguage-indicative byte sequences, i.e.
sequences of 1 to 4 bytes that have been selected to be stronglycharacteristic of a particular language or set of languages regardless of the text source.
Lui and Baldwin(2012) present langid.py,1an off-the-shelf LangID system that utilizes the LD feature set.
In thiswork, we re-train langid.py using the training data provided by the shared task organizers, and usethis as a baseline result representative of the state-of-the-art in LangID.2.2 Hierarchical LangIDIn LangID research to date, systems generally do not take into account any form of structure in theclass space.
In this shared task, languages are explicitly grouped into 6 disjoint groups.
We make useof this structure by introducing a two-level LangID model.
The first level implements a single group-level classifier, which takes an input sentence and identifies the language group (A?F) that the sentenceis from.
The output of this group-level classifier is used to select a corresponding per-group classifier,that is trained only on data for languages in the group.
This per-group classifier is applied to the inputsentence and the output thereof is the final label for the sentence.2.3 De-Lexicalized Text Representation for DSLOne of the challenges in a machine learning approach to discriminating similar languages is to learndifferences between languages that are truly representative of the distinction between varieties, ratherthan differences that are merely representative of peculiarities of the training data (Kilgarriff, 2001).
Onepossible confounding factor is the topicality of the training data ?
if the data for each variety is drawnfrom different datasets, it is possible that a classifier will simply learn the topical differences betweendatasets.
Diwersy et al.
(2014) carried out a study of colligations in French varieties, where the variationin the grammatical function of noun lemmas was studied across French-language newspapers from sixcountries.
In their initial analysis the found that the characteristic features of each country included thename of the country and other country-specific proper nouns, which resulted in near 100% classificationaccuracy but do not provide any insight into national varieties from a linguistic perspective.One strategy that has been proposed to mitigate the effect of such topical differences is the use ofa de-lexicalized text representation (Lui and Cook, 2013).
The de-lexicalization is achieved throughthe use of a Part-Of-Speech tagger, which labels each word in a sentence according to its word class(such as Noun, Verb, Adjective etc).
De-lexicalized text representations through POS tagging were firstconsidered for native language identification (NLI), where they were used as a proxy for syntax in orderto capture certain types of grammatical errors (Wong and Dras, 2009).
Syntactic structure is known tovary across national dialects (Trudgill and Hannah, 2008), so Lui and Cook (2013) investigated POS plusfunction word n-grams as a proxy for syntactic structure, and used this representation to build classifiersto discriminate between Canadian, British and American English.
They found that classifiers using such arepresentation achieved above-baseline results, indicating some systematic differences between varietiescould be captured through the use of such a de-lexicalized representation.
In this work, we explore thisidea further ?
in particular, we examine (1) the applicability of de-lexicalized text representations toother languages using automatically-induced crosslingual POS taggers, and (2) the difference in accuracyfor discriminating English varieties between representations based on a coarse-grained universal tagset(Section 2.3.1) as compared to a very fine-grained tagset used in deep parsing (Section 2.3.2).1http://github.com/saffsd/langid.py130Sandy quit on Tuesday Sandy quit TuesdayUT NOUN VERB ADP NOUN NOUN VERB NOUNLTT n - pn v np*p np i-tmp n - c-dow n - pn v np*n - c-dowBritish English American EnglishTable 1: Example of tags assigned with coarse-grained Universal Tagset (UT) and fine-grained lexicaltype tagset (LTT).2.3.1 Crosslingual POS TaggingA key issue in generating de-lexicalized text representations based on POS tags is the lack of availabilityof POS taggers for many languages.
While some languages have some tools available for POS tagging(e.g.
Treaties (Schmid, 1994) has parameter files for Spanish and Portuguese), the availability of POStaggers is far from universal.
To address this problem for the purposes of discriminating similar lan-guages, we draw on previous work in unsupervised cross-lingual POS tagging (Duong et al., 2013) tobuild a POS tagger for each group of languages, a method which we will refer to hereafter as ?UMPOS?.UMPOS employs a 12-tag Universal Tagset introduced by Petrov et al.
(2012), which consists of thetags NOUN, VERB, ADJ (adjective), ADV (adverb), PRON (pronoun), DET (determiner or article), ADP(preposition or postposition), NUM (numeral), CONJ (conjunction), PRT (particle), PUNCT (punctua-tion), and X (all other categories, e.g., foreign words or abbreviations).
These twelve basic tags constitutea ?universal?
tagset in that they can be used to describe the morphosyntax of any language at a coarselevel.UMPOS generates POS taggers for new languages in an unsupervised fashion, by making use ofparallel data and an existing POS tagger.
The input for UMPOS is: (1) parallel data between the sourceand target languages; and (2) a supervised POS tagger for the source language.
The output will be thetagger for the target language.
The parallel data acts as a bridge to transfer POS annotation informationfrom the source language to the target language.The steps used in UMPOS are as follow.
First, we collect parallel data which has English as the sourcelanguage, drawing from Europarl (Koehn, 2005) and EUbookshop (Skadin?
?s et al., 2014).
UMPOS word-aligns the parallel data using the Giza++ alignment tool (Och and Ney, 2003).
The English side is POS-tagged using the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), and the POS tags are then projected fromEnglish to the target language based solely on one-to-one mappings.
Using the sentence alignment score,UMPOS ranks the ?goodness?
of projected sentences and builds a seed model for the target language ona subset of the parallel data.
To further improve accuracy, UMPOS builds the final model by applyingself-training with revision to the rest of the data as follows: (1) the parallel corpus data is divided intodifferent blocks; (2) the first block is tagged using the seed model; (3) the block is revised based onalignment confidence; (4) a new tagger is trained on the first block and then used to tag the second block.This process continues until all blocks are tagged.
In experiments on a set of 8 languages, Duong et al.
(2013) report accuracy of 83.4%, which is state-of-the-art for unsupervised POS tagging.2.3.2 English Tagging Using ERG Lexical TypesFocusing specifically on language Group F ?
British English and American English ?
we leveragedlinguistic information from the analyses produced by the English Resource Grammar (ERG: Flickinger(2002)), a broad-coverage, handcrafted grammar of English in the HPSG framework (Pollard and Sag,1994) and developed within the DELPH-IN2research initiative.
In particular, we extracted the lexicaltypes assigned to tokens by the parser for the best analysis of each input string.
In accordance withthe heavily lexicalized nature of HPSG, lexical types are the primary means of distinguishing betweendifferent morphosyntactic contexts in which a given lexical entry can occur.
They can be thought of asfine-grained POS tags, containing subcategorisation information in addition to part of speech informa-tion, and semantic information in cases that it directly impacts on morphosyntax.
The version of theERG we used (the ?1212?
release) has almost 1000 lexical types.Table 1 illustrates an example of the type of syntactic variation that can be captured with the finer-2http://www.delph-in.net131Group Language CodeWeb Corpora Existing CorporaTLD # words # datasets # wordsA Bosnian bs .ba 817383 4 715602A Croatian hr .hr 43307311 5 1536623A Serbian sr .rs 1374787 4 1204684B Indonesian id .id 23812382 3 564824B Malaysian my .my 2596378 3 535221C Czech cz .cz 17103140 8 2181486C Slovakian sk .sk 17253001 8 2308083D Brazilian Portuguese pt-BR .br 27369673 4 860065D European Portuguese pt-PT .pt 22620401 8 2860321E Argentine Spanish es-AR .ar 45913651 2 619500E Peninsular Spanish es-ES .es 30965338 9 3458462F British English en-GB .uk 20375047 1 523653F American English en-US .us 21298230 1 527915Table 2: Word count of training data used for open submissions.grained lexical types, that would be missed with the coarse-grained universal tagset.
In American En-glish, both Sandy resigned on Tuesday and Sandy resigned on Tuesday are acceptable whereas BritishEnglish does not permit the omission of the preposition before dates.
In the coarse-grained tagset, theAmerican English form results in a sequence VERB : NOUN, which is not particularly interesting as weexpect this to occur in both English varieties, whereas the fine-grained lexical types allow us to capturethe sequence v np*ntr : n - c-dow (verb followed by count noun [day of week]), which we expectto see in American English but not in British English.Since the ERG models a sharp notion of grammaticality, not all inputs receive an analysis ?
whetherdue to gaps in the coverage of the grammar or genuinely ungrammatical input.
The ERG achieveda coverage of 86% over the training data across both British English and American English.
Sentenceswhich failed to parse were excluded from use as input into the classifier.
However the inability to classifyany sentence which we cannot parse is unsatisfactory.
We solved this problem by generating lexical typefeatures for sentences which failed to parse using the ERG-trained ?ubertagger of Dridan (2013), whichperforms both tokenisation and supertagging of lexical types and improves parser efficiency by reducingambiguity in the input lattice to the parser.2.4 External CorporaThe DSL shared task invited two categories of participation: (1) Closed, using only training data providedby the organizers (Tan et al., 2014); and (2) Open, using any training data available to participants.
Toparticipate in the latter category, we sourced additional training data through: (1) collection of datarelevant to this task from existing text corpora; and (2) automatic construction of web corpora.
Theinformation about the additional training data is shown in Table 2.2.4.1 Existing CorporaWe collected training data from a number of existing corpora, as shown in Table 3.
Many of the cor-pora that we used are part of OPUS (Tiedemann, 2012), which is a collection of sentence-aligned textcorpora commonly used for research in machine translation.
The exceptions are: (1) debian, whichwas constructed using translations of message strings from the Debian operating system,3; (2) BNC ?the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000); (3) OANC ?
the open component of the Second Releaseof the American National Corpus (Ide and Macleod, 2001), and (4) Reuters Corpus Volume 2 (RCV2);4a corpus of news stories by local reporters in 13 languages.
We sampled approximately 19000 sentencesfrom each of the BNC and OANC, which we used as training data to generate ERG lextype features (Sec-tion 2.3.2) for British English (en-GB) and American English (en-US), respectively.

Note that, fora given text source, we didn?t necessarily use data for all available languages.
For example, debiancontains British English and American English translations, which we did not use.2.4.2 Web Corpus ConstructionEach existing corpus we describe in Section 2.4.1 provides incomplete coverage over the set of languagesin the shared task dataset.
In order to have a resource that covers all the languages in the shared taskdrawn from a single source, we constructed web corpora for each language.
Our approach was stronglyinspired by the approach used to create ukWaC (Ferraresi et al., 2008), and the creation of each sub-language?s corpus involved crawling the top level domains of the primary countries associated withthose sub-languages.
Based on the findings of Cook and Hirst (2012), the assumption underlying thisapproach is that text found in the top-level domains (TLDs) of those countries will primarily be ofthe sub-language dominant in that country.
For instance, we assume that Portuguese text found whencrawling the .pt TLD will primarily be European Portuguese, while the Portuguese found in .br willbe primarily Brazilian Portuguese.The process of creating a corpus for each sub-language involved translating a sample of 200 of theoriginal ukWaC queries into each language using Panlex (Baldwin et al., 2010).5These queries were thensubmitted to the Bing Search API using the BootCaT tools (Baroni and Bernardini, 2004), constrainingresults to the relevant TLD.
For each query, we took the first 10 URLs yielded by Bing and appendedthem to a list of seed URLs for that language.
After deduplication, the seed URLs were then fed to aHeritrix 3.1.16instance with default settings other than constraining the crawled content to the relevantTLD.Corpora were then created from the data gathered by Heritrix.
Following the ukWaC approach,only documents with a MIME type of HTML and size between 5k and 200k bytes were used.
Jus-text (Pomik?alek, 2011) was used to extract text from the selected documents.
langid.py (Lui andBaldwin, 2012) was then used to discard documents whose text was not in the relevant language or lan-guage group.
The corpus was then refined through deduplication.
First, near-deduplication was done atthe paragraph level using Onion (Pomik?alek, 2011) with its default settings.
Then, exact-match sentence-level deduplication, ignoring whitespace and case, was applied.3 Results and DiscussionTable 4 summarizes the runs submitted by team UniMelb NLP to the VarDial DSL shared task.
Wesubmitted the maximum number of runs allowed, i.e.
3 closed runs and 3 open runs, to both the ?general?Groups A?E subtask as well as the English-specific Group F subtask.
We applied different methods toGroup F, as some of the tools (the ERG) and resources (BNC/OANC) were specific to English.

or Open (?O?
), and thefinal digit indicates the run number.AC1 represents a benchmark result based on the LangID system (Lui and Baldwin, 2012).
We usedthe training tools provided with langid.py to generate a new model using the training data providedby the shared task organizers, noting that as only data from a single source is used, we are not able tofully exploit the cross-domain feature selection (Lui and Baldwin, 2011) implemented by langid.py.The macro-averaged F-score across groups is substantially lower than that on standard LangID datasets(Lui and Baldwin, 2012).AC2 and FC2 are a straightforward implementation of hierarchical LangID (Section 2.2), usingmostly-default settings of langid.py.
A 6-way group-level classifier is trained, and well as 6 differentper-group classifiers.
We increase the number of features selected per class (i.e.
group or language) to500 from the default of 300, to compensate for the smaller number of classes (langid.py off-the-shelf supports 97 languages).
In our internal testing on the provided development data, the group-levelclassifier achieved 100% accuracy in classifying sentences at the group level, essentially reducing theproblem to within-group disambiguation.
Despite being one of the simplest approaches, overall thiswas our best-performing submission for Groups A?E.
It also represents a substantial improvement onAC1, further emphasizing the need to implement hierarchical LangID in order to attain high accuracy indiscriminating similar languages.AC3 and FC3 are based solely on POS-tag sequences generated by UMPOS, and implement a hierar-chical LangID approach similar to AC2/FC2.
Each sentence in the training data is mapped to a POS-tagsequence in the 12-tag universal tagset, using the per-group POS tagger for the language group.
Each tagwas represented using a single character, allowing us to make use of langid.py to train 6 per-groupclassifiers based on n-grams of POS-tags.
We used n-grams of order 1?6, and selected 5000 top-rankedsequences per-language.
To classify test data, the same group-level classifier used in AC2 was used tomap sentences to language groups, and then the per-group POS tagger was applied to derive the corre-sponding stream of POS tags for each sentence.
The corresponding per-group classifier trained on POStag sequences was then applied to produce the final label for the sentence.

The notation used is as follows: .

Nonetheless,the results attained are above baseline, indicating that there are systematic differences between languagesin each group that can be captured by an unsupervised approach to POS-tagging using a coarse-grainedtagset.
This extends the similar observation made by Lui and Cook (2013) on varieties of English, show-ing that the same is true for the other language groups in this shared task.
Also of interest is the higheraccuracy attained by the POS-tag features on Groups A?E (i.e.
AC3) than on English (Group F, FC3).The top-10 sequences per-group are presented in Table 5, where it can be seen that the sequences areoften slightly more common in one language in the group than the other language(s).
One limitation ofthe Information Gain based feature selection used in langid.py is that each feature is scored inde-pendently, and each language receives a binarized score.
This can be seen in the features selected forGroup A, where all the top-10 features selected involve particles (labelled T).
Overall, this indicates thatCroatian (hr) appears to use particles much less frequently than Serbian (sr) or Bosnian (bs), which isan intriguing finding.
However, most of the top-10 features are redundant in that they all convey verysimilar information.Similar to FC3, a hierarchical LangID approach is used in FC1, in conjunction with per-group classi-fiers based on a sequence of tags derived from the original sentence.
The difference between the taggersused for FC3 and FC1 is that the FC3 tagger utilizes the 12-tag universal tagset, whereas the FC1 taggeruses the English-specific lexical types from the ERG (Section 2.3.2), a set of approximately 1000 tags.There is hence a trade-off to be made between the degree of distinction between tags, and the relativesparsity of the data ?
having a larger tagset means that any given sequence of tags is proportionally lesslikely to occur.
On the basis of the results of FC1 and FC3 on the dev data, the lexical type featuresmarginally outperform the coarse-grained universal tagset.
However, this result is made harder to inter-pret by the mismatch between the dev and tst partitions of the shared task dataset.
We will discussthis issue in more detail below, in the context of examining the results on Group F for the open category.In the open category, we focused primarily on the effect of using different sources of training data.AO1 and AO2 both implement a hierarchical LangID approach, again using the group-level classifierfrom AC2.
For the per-group classifiers, runs AO1 and AO2 use a naive Bayes model on a word-levelrepresentation, with feature selection by Information Gain.
The difference between the two is that A01uses samples from existing text corpora (Section 2.4.1), whereas A02 uses web corpora that we preparedspecifically for this shared task (Section 2.4.2).
In terms of accuracy, both types of corpora perform135substantially better than baseline, indicating that at the word level, there are differences between thelanguage varieties that are consistent across the different corpus types.
This result is complementary toCook and Hirst (2012), who found that web corpora from specific top-level domains were representativeof national varieties of English.
AO2 (web corpora) outperforms AO1 (existing corpora), further high-lighting the relevance of web corpora as a source of training data for discriminating similar languages.However, our models trained on external data were not able to outperform the models trained on theofficial training data for Groups A?E.
A03 consists of a 5-way majority vote between results AC1, AC2,AC3, AO1 and AO2.
Including the predictions from the closed submissions substantially improves theresult with respect to AO1/AO2, but overall our best result for Groups A?E was obtained by run AC2.For Group F, FO1 utilizes ERG lexical type features in the same manner as FC1, the difference beingthat FC1 uses the shared task trn partition, whereas FO1 uses sentences sampled from existing corpora,specifically BNC for en-GB and OANC for en-US.
FO2 implements the same concept as AO2, namely aword-level naive Bayes model trained using web corpora.
For the Group F (i.e.
English) subtask, this wasour best-performing submission overall.
FO3 is a 5-way vote between FC1, FC2, FC3, FO1 and FO2,similar to AO3.
Notably, our Group F submissions based on the supplied training data all performedsubstantially better on the dev partition of the shared task dataset than on the tst partition.
The inverseis true for our submissions based on external corpora, where all our entries performed substantially betteron the tst partition than on the dev partition.
Furthermore, the differences are fairly large, particularlysince Group F is a binary classification task with a 50% baseline.
This implies that, at least under ourmodels, the en-GB portion of the trn partition is a better model of the en-US portion of the tst partitionthan the en-GB portion thereof.
This is likely due to the manual intervention that was only carried outon the test portion of the dataset (Zampieri et al., 2014).Our Group F results appear to be inferior to previous work on discriminating English varieties (Luiand Cook, 2013).
However, there are a number of differences that make it difficult to compare theresults: Lui and Cook (2013) studied differences between Australian, British and Canadian English,whereas the shared task focused on differences between British and American English.
Lui and Cook(2013) also draw on training data from a variety of domains (national corpora, web corpora and Twittermessages), whereas the shared task used a dataset collected from newspaper texts (Tan et al., 2014).Consistent with Cook and Hirst (2012) and Lui and Cook (2013), we found that web corpora appear to berepresentative of national varieties, and consistent with Lui and Cook (2013) we found that de-lexicalizedrepresentations of text are able to provide better than baseline discrimination between national varieties.Overall, these results highlight the need for further research into discriminating between varieties ofEnglish.4 ConclusionDiscriminating between similar languages is an interesting sub-problem in language identification, andthe DSL shared task at VarDial has given us an opportunity to examine possible solutions in greaterdetail.
Our most successful methods implement straightforward hierarchical LangID, firstly identifyingthe language group that a sentence belongs to, before identifying the specific language.
We examined anumber of text representations for the per-group language identifiers, including a standard representationfor language identification based on language-indicative byte sequences, as well as with de-lexicalizedtext representations.
We found that the performance of de-lexicalized representations was above baseline,however we were not able to fully investigate approaches to integrating predictions from lexicalizedand de-lexicalized text representations due to time constraints.
We also found that when using externalcorpora, web corpora constructed by scraping per-country top-level domains performed as well as (ifnot better than) data collected from existing text corpora, supporting the hypothesis that web corporaare representative of national varieties of respective languages.
Overall, our best result was obtained byapplying two-level hierarchical LangID, firstly identifying the language group that a sentence belongsto, and then disambiguating within each group.
Our best result was achieved by applying an existingLangID method (Lui and Baldwin, 2012) to both the group-level and the per-group classification tasks.136AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to thank Li Wang, Rebecca Dridan and Bahar Salehi for their kind assistance withthis research.
