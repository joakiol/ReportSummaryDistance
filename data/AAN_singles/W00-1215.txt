Semantic Annotation of Chinese Phrases Using Recursive-GraphJi DonghongKent Ridge Digital Labs,Singapore, 119613dhj i@krdl.org.sgAbstractIn this paper, we propose a recursive graphbased scheme for semantic annotation ofChinese phrases.
Compared with others, thisscheme can fully differentiate hose Chinesephrases that comprise the same contentwords but hold different meanings due totheir different word order or some involvedfunction words, and capture the hierarchicalconceptual structure of Chinese phrases,which underlies their main semanticinformation.
We also give the guidelines forannotating various commonly used types ofChinese phrases.1 IntroductionSemantically annotated linguistic data areimportant resources for natural languageprocessing, and have been used in manyNLP areas, e.g., parsing, word sensedisambiguation, co-reference r solution andinformation extraction, etc.
But due to hugeefforts needed in building them and generaldifficulties in dealing with semanticinformation, such resources are scarcely seenfor most languages including Chinese, if notall.In this paper, we focus on Chinesephrases and present a recursive graph basedscheme for their semantic annotation.Compared with the same task for sentences,it only involves a relatively small data setand simple semantic information but haspotential generality and application.One is at which goal the annotation is aimed.In our case, the goal is established to be tohelp disclose the correspondence b tweenlinguistic forms and meaning, which is alsothe primary goal in both traditional linguisticresearch (Chomsky, 1968) and naturallanguage understanding (Allen, 1995).The other problem is whether theannotation can significantly contribute to theestablished goal.
In our case, the answer is ofcourse positive.
First, the phrases themselvesare a specific kind of linguistic forms, thustheir semantic annotation directly providesthe correspondence b tween them and theirmeanings.
Second, by some kinds of analogyrules, these annotated phrases can beexamples for deriving the correspondencebetween new phrases and their meanings.Third, as compared with western languages,Chinese language has a specific feature thatits sentences form in roughly the same wayas its phrases (Zhu, 1982), which shows thatby some kinds of combinatory rules, themapping between sentences and theirmeanings can also be determined based onthe examples.The remainder of this paper is organisedas the following.
In section 2, we describethe motivation of introducing recursivegraph.
In section 3, we formally define whatis a recursive graph.
In section 4, we specifyhow commonly used types of Chinesephrases are annotated using recursive graph.In section 5, we give the conclusion anddiscuss ome future work.2 MotivationAs a specific semantic annotation task,two problems hould be made clear at first.In general, semantic annotation of linguisticforms is to associate with them their101semantic information being represented insome formal languages or diagrams.
Withthe semantic information involved varying,the formal languages or diagrams may bedifferent.One commonly used diagram forsemantic annotation of linguistic forms isdependent tree, in which the dependence orcontrol relationship between constituents ofa linguistic form is depicted (Langacker,1997).
But such trees may be not powerfulenough to differentiate those Chinesephrases that comprise the same contentwords but hold different meanings due totheir word order or involved function words.As an example, consider 1) and 2) 1.1)/zousi/ /qiche/smuggle car2)/qiche/ /zousi/car smuggleNotice 1) and 2) contain the same contentwords, but hold different word order.Regarding their meanings, 1) is anambiguous phrase, corresponding with twoEnglish translation phrases as 3) and 4).3) to smuggle cars4) smuggled carsThe translation phrase for 2) is 5).5) the smuggling of carsSo, there are altogether three meanings heldby the two phrases.
But the two contentwords can only form two dependent trees,listed in 6) and 7).1 In this paper, whenever listing a Chinese word, wealways list its Pinyin included within two symbols 7',and its English translation.
For a Chinese phrase, wefurthermore list its English translation whennecessary.6) ~ (/qiche/, car)t~L(/zousi/, smuggle)7) ;~ ~ (/zousi/, smuggle)t(/qich , car)Obviously, these two dependent trees cannotcode the three meanings listed in 3), 4) and5).
Only if we could see the same word;~1~ L(/zousi/, smuggle) semanticallydifferent in 1) and 2), we could add anotherdependent tree 8) to code 5), with 6) and 7)corresponding with 3) and 4) respectively.8) j~t~ L'(/zousi/, smuggle) 2t~ :~i~: (Iqichel, car)But this view is quite unintuitive, and willlead to contradictory.
Consider other twophrases 9) and 10).9)/zousi/ /jituan/smuggle blocsmuggling bloc10)/qiche/ /zousi/ /jituan/car smuggle bloccar smuggling blocIntuitively, the word :~l~/L(/zousi/, smuggle)in 2) holds the same meaning as the word in10), which subsequently is equivalent withthe same word in 9).
On the other hand, thereis no reason to treat the same word~L (/zousi/, smuggle) semanticallydifferently in 1) and 9), two typical noun2 To differentiate the two words, we add one quotationmark.102phrases.
Particularly, they are both followedby a typical noun in the two phrases.The second problem for dependent tree tosemantically annotate linguistic forms is thatdue to its tree nature, it cannot representmulti-dependence relationship, in which onenode is controlled by several nodes.
Forexample, consider 11).11)/xihuan/ /ziji/ /de/ /ren/like self of peoplethe people who like oneselfConventionally, its dependent tree should be12).12) ~ (/ren/, people)gX (/xihuan/, like)~ (/ziji/, self)But intuitively, there should be somedependence r lationship between )k(/ren/,people) and fl ~ (/ziji/, self).
If we add thisrelationship, it will become agraph.2.2 Conceptual GraphConceptual graph is another diagram forsemantic annotation of linguistic forms,which comprises concepts and conceptualrelationship denoted by linguistic forms(Eklund, 1996).
Although it is claimed tobe a directed graph in its original form, it isequivalent to an undirected graph in nature,with its relationship nodes and their directededges replaced with an undirected edge todirectly denote the relationship.One problem with this diagram forsemantic annotation is that it cannot code theinformation about head, if any, in a linguisticform, which intuitively specifies the maininformation carried by a linguistic form.
Thiswill lead to severe problems when using thegraph to represent linguistic forms.
Forexample, both phrases 1) and 2) with allthree meanings 3), 4) and 5) would berepresented by the same diagram as in 13) 3 .13) ~/~ ~:~(/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car)To differentiate the three meanings heldby the two phrases, we suggest using thefollowing two weighted graphs and oneunweighted graph, i.e., 14), 15) and 16) torepresent 3), 4) and 5) respectively.14) ~$L ~(/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car)15, I I(/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car)16) \[ ~t~L ~(/zousi/, smuggle) (/qiche/, car)Here we basically use undirected graphs toannotate phrases, and introduce a rectangleto denote the head of a linguistic phrase, ifany.
Notice that we don't mark a head in 14),which means that we don't take the verb~L(/zousi/ ,  smuggle) as the head of theverb phrase as usual.
In general, for mostverb phrases like 14) in Chinese, theycorrespond with two modifier-center phraseslike 15) and 16) that comprise the samecontent words but with different meanings.For such phrases, we generally use aheadword to differentiate between the verbphrase and the two modifier-center phrases,and then use different headword todistinguish the two modifier-center phrases.Another problem with conceptualstructure is concerned with its ability to dealwith hierarchical structures.
Although nestedconceptual structure is introduced to3 Unless necessary, we don't list relationship in theconceptual graph.103describe nested belief, one particular kind ofhierarchical structures (Genevirve, 1998),some simple hierarchical structures cannotbe distinguished or annotated appropriately.As an example, consider 17) and 18).17) ~ ~ ~L  ~/piaoliang/ /de/ /zousi/ /qiche/beautiful of smuggle carbeautiful smuggled cars18) ~I~L ~.
,  ~ ~/zousi/ /piaoliang/ /de/ /qiche/smuggle beautiful of carto smuggle beautiful carsUsing conceptual graph, we can annotateboth of them as 19), in which case the twophrases cannot be distinguished.19) ~t~L~ ~ ~ ~If based on undirected graph plus head, 17)can be annotated as 20).20,But there will be no appropriate annotationfor 18), because on the one hand,~( /q iche/ ,car )  should be coded as a headdue to its relationship with ~g~(/piaoliang/,beautiful), on the other hand, it's role as theobject of the verb ~L(/zousi/ ,  smuggle)makes it illegal to be a head.To differentiate 17) and 18), we furthersuggest specifying the embedded structuresin linguistic forms in some way, and usecircles to denote them.
In such opinion, 17)can be annotated as 21) and 22) respectively.21) ~In this diagram, the smaller rectangledenotes the head of the modifier-centerphrase ~$/L~ (/zousiqiche/, smuggledcars), the circle codes the phrase as anembedded structure of the whole phrase,while bigger rectangle denotes the head ofthe whole phrase.22) :xT~ L ~In this diagram, the circle denotes theembedded structure $~, ;~~( /p iao f iangde qiche/, beautiful cars), while the rectangledenotes the head of the embedded structure.Notice the phrase on the whole is a verbphrase, so there is no head coded here.3.
Recursive GraphOne major concern for semantic annotationof linguistic forms is what semanticinformation will be coded, or moregenerally, what is their semanticinformation, which has long been a quitecontroversial question.
From the point ofview of concepts, linguistic forms includingphrases emantically refer to concepts, whichwe think generally fall within fourcategories:a) preliminary concept.
For example, wemay see the word tl/~(/wu/, thing)denotes aprefiminary concept.b) compositional concept or situtm'on,which consists of some concepts andtheir relation 4.
For example, phrase 1)with the meaning 3) denotes asituation including the concepts thetwo content words, :i~l~L(/zousi/,smuggle) and ~( /q iche / ,  car),denote respectively, and theirrelationship, ~llJ{:(/shoushi/, patient).4 relation is also a specific kind of concopts, e.g.,~$(/shoushi/, patient) is a relation between~L(/zousi/, smuggle) and ~(/qicheJ, car).104c) subordinate concept or specificconcept within a situation, forexample, phrase 1) with the meaning4) refers to the concept denoted by~( /q iche / ,  car) in the situationmentioned in b).d) subordinate feature, or specificfeature of a situation or a concept,which generally stands for therelationship between a situation or aconcept and another unknownconcept.
Consider 23).23) ~r~i~l~ ~ ~b~/guniang/ /de/ /waimao/girl of appearancethe appearance of girlsIn this phrase, the word ~t'~(/waimao/, appearance) denotes afeature of the concept the word ~i~i~l~(/guniang/, girl) denotes, and thevalue of this feature doesn't occur inthis phrase.Notice that the concepts within one situationthemselves may be compositional concepts,subordinate concepts or subordinate f atures,so the concepts that linguistic formsincluding phrases denote generally presents akind of hierarchical structure.
In fact, thishierarchical structure in return represents hemain semantic information of linguisticforms.We introduce recursive graph as formaldiagram to represent the hierarchicalstructure of linguistic forms.
Let Po be theset of preliminary points, we call pc Po a O-level graph.
Suppose Pi~-Po, Ei(~-Po) is theset of the edges between points in P1,Ri(~(PlX El)) is the set of relations betweenpoints in PI and edges in Et s, then:s Here, Edges are also points.
An edge pointconnecting two other points here equals an edge in atraditional definition of graph.i) <P1, El, Ri> is a I-levelcompositional graph;ii) <<Pi, El, R~>, p> (peP9 is a 1-level point-headed graph;iii) <<P1, El, R/>, e> (e~E1) is a 1-level edge-headed graph;iv) 1-level concepts comprise 1-1evelcompositional graphs, l-levelpoint-headed graphs, and 1-leveledge-headed graphs.Let ,_o=Po, Zn-1 be the set of (n-1)-leveIgraphs, suppose Pn~(,.ouZiu .... ,Za4),(PnnXn.1)?NIL, En(C-Pn) is the set of theedges between points in P~, Rn(C(P=x En)) isthe set of relations between points in P= andedges in En, then:v)vi)vii)viii)<P~, E~, Rn> is a n-levelcompositional graph;<<en,  En, Rn>, p> (P~Pn) is a n-level point-headed graph;<<P~, E~, Rn>, e> (e~En) is a n-level edge-headed graph;n-level concepts comprise n-levelcompositional graphs, n-levelpoint-headed graphs, and n-leveledge-headed graphs.Intuitively, O-level graph corresponds withpreliminary points, compositional graphcorresponds with situation, point-headedgraph corresponds with subordinate concept,and edge-headed graph corresponds withsubordinate f ature.4.
Annotation GuidelinesIn general, Chinese phrases can roughly beclassified into five categories, i.e., sub-predicate, verb-object, modifier-center, verb-complement, and coordinate.
We give someexamples in the following for each category.4.1 Sub-predicate105In general, the phrase :in this categorydenotes a compositional concept.
Forexample, 24) can be annotated as 25).24) ~t/~ .l~ ~/guniang/ /piaoliang/girl beautifulGirls are beautiful25) ~ti~i l~ ~Intuitively, the concept the wordJti!i~l~(/guniang/, irl) denotes has a feature,~t '~ (/waimao/, appearance), and its valueis ~( /p iao l iang / ,  beautiful).
In otherwords, there exists a relationship, i.e.,~l'~(/waimao/, appearance), between thetwo concepts denoted by ~rdi~l~(/guniang/,girl) and ~-~ (/piaoliang/, beautiful)respectively 6.4.2 Verb-objectSimilar with sub-predicate phrases, thephrase in this category also denotes acompositional concept.
Phrase 1) with themeaning 3) is an example, and can beannotated as 26).26) ~$~ ~Intuitively, there exists a relationship, i.e.,~l : ( /shoushi / ,  patient), between the twoconcepts denoted by ;~t~L (/zousi/, smuggle)and ~ (/qiche/, car) respectively.4.3 Modifier-centerThe phrase in this category generally denotesa subordinate concept.
The center here in thephrase can be a verb, a noun or an adjective.As examples, 27) and 28) are annotated as29) and 30).27)28)/piaoliang/ /de/ /guniang/beautiful of girlbeautiful girls/guniang/ /de/ /piaoliang/girl of beautifulthe beauty of girls29)9b~IIntuitively, the two concepts denoted by thetwo content words ~t  (/guniang/, girl) and~g~ (/piaoliang/, beautiful) in 27) and 28)hold the same relationship, i.e.,?t'~(/waimao/, appearance) as in 24).
Thedifference lies in that the phrases 27) and 28)both have a head, i.e., ~i~i~l~ (/guniang/, girl)and ~-~ (/piaoliang/, beautiful)respectively.Another example is 23), it denotes ansubordinate f ature, annotated as 31) 7.IIntuitively, the concept denoted by~t ( /gun iang/ ,  girl) has a feature~b~ (/waimao/, appearance), which is thehead of this phrase.4.4 Verb-complementFor the phrase in this category, the semanticrelationship between its two parts, i.e., verband complement, is very complicated (Ma,1987); even there is no direct semantic links6 Unless necessary, we don't list the link betweenconcepts and relation ames.7 The link between ~i~l~(/guniang/, girl) and~b~(/waimao/, appearance) denotes a relationbetween concepts and relationships.106between them sometimes.
Consider 32) and33).32)/chi/ /bao/eat full.to eat and be full33) ~ 't~/pao/ /kuai/run fastto run fastIn 32), {~(/bao/, full) has a direct link withthe agent of ~(/chi/, eat), in which sense thetwo concepts denoted by ~\[g(/bao/, full) and~(/chi/, eat) has no direct semantic link.
Wedon't consider such phrases in our annotationtemporarily.
In contrast, in 33), 'I~(/kuai/,fast) acts as the value of one feature:~.~(/sudu/, speed) of ~(/pao/, run), inwhich sense it has a direct semantic link with~?~(/pao/, run).
They form a subordinateconcept, annotated as 34).34) ~-q  '\[~4.5 CoordinateIn general, the phrase in this categorydenotes a compositional concept.
As anexample, consider 35).35)/shi/ /sheng/teacher studentteacher and studentIntuitively, there is a relationship, i.e.,9-f (/bing/, and), between the two conceptsdenoted by the two words.
So, it can beannotated as 36).36) ~5 Conclusion and FutureWorkIn this paper, we propose a recursive graphbased scheme for semantic annotation ofChinese phrases.
This scheme can fullydifferentiate those Chinese phrases thatcomprise the same content words but withdifferent meaning due to their different wordorder or some involved function words.
Itcan also capture the hierarchical conceptualstructures of Chinese phrases, whichdetermine their main semantic information.Now, we have annotated about 5,000Chinese phrases using this scheme.
Onemethodological issue is that we also choosemulti-character Chinese words as candidateannotation phrases.
The reason is that unlikewestern languages, there is no clear-cutbetween words and phrases in Chinese, formost multi-character Chinese words, theircomponents may also be words, and themeaning of the multi-character words tendsto be strongly related with that of theircomponent words.
In this sense, the wordscan be treated as basic phrases.
Moreimportantly, such basic annotation examplescan be more complete in the sense ofcoverage.Future work will extend to 50,000Chinese phrases.
Another future work is tolearn the rules that dete~ne the mappingbetween linguistic forms and meaningsbased on this annotation, and apply the rulesto new phrases and sentences.
If this can besuccessful, we can develop a semanticanalyzer for Chinese without any syntacticanalysis.
In particular, we can avoid part-of-speeches or syntactic structures that havelong been difficult notions for Chineselanguages.AcknowledgmentsI would like to thank Prof. Dong Zhendongand Prof. Huang Changning for their107insightful discussions, and the anonymousreviewers for their comments.ReferencesJ.Allen, Natural 'Language Understanding, SecondEdition, the Benj arnirgCurnming PublishingCompany, INC, 1995.Chomsky, 1968, Language and Mind, Enlargededition, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Publishers.Eklnnd, Peter W., Gerard Ellis, & Graham Mann, eds.
