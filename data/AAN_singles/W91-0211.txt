IN SO MANY WORDSKNOWLEDGE AS A LEXICAL PHENOMENONWillem Meijs & Piek VossenAmsterdam Dictionary Research GroupEnglish Department, Amsterdam UniversitySpuistraat 2101012 VT AmsterdamThe NetherlandsLINKS@ALF.!
~.T.UVA.NLAbstractLexical knowledge is knowledge that can be expressed in words.
Circular though this may seem,we think it provides a perfectly reasonable point of departure, for, in line with a long-standingphilosophical tradition it posits communicability as the most characteristic aspect of lexicalknowledge.
Knowledge representation systems hould be designed so as to fit lexical data ratherthan the other way round.
A broad view of the possible scope of lexical semantics would thus beone which tries to chart out the systematic, generalizable aspects of word meanings, and of therelations between words, drawing on readily accessible sources of lexical knowledge, such asmachine readable dictionaries, encyclopedias, and representative corpora, coupled with the kind ofanalytic apparatus that is needed to fruitfully explore such sources, for instance custom-builtparsers to cope with dictionary definitions (Vossen 1990), statistical programs to deal with thedistributional properties of lexical items in large corpora (Church & Hanks 1990) etc.
At the sametime this kind of massive data-acquisition should be made sensitive to the borders betweenperceptual experience, lexical knowledge and expert knowledge.1 IntroductionMany psychologists are quite content to declare that intelligence is what you measure by means ofan intelligence t st.
In a somewhat similar way one could say that lexical knowledge isthe kind ofknowledge that can be expressed in words.
An advantage of this position is that you can turn itround: knowledge that cannot be expressed in words is not lexical knowledge.
A furtheradvantage is that it automatically relates lexical knowledge to something that lends itself tointersubjective inspection: linguistic utterances.
And yet another advantage is that it tells us howand where to look for typical expressions of lexical knowledge within the welter of linguisticutterances.
In ever widening concentric circles, we can inspect: general dictionaries as sources ofthe lexical knowledge that is associated with the 'common core' vocabulary; encyclopedias foradditional knowledge associated with many of the items contained in the dictionaries and forlexically expressed information about all kinds of facts and events; specialiTed dictionaries for moreexpert knowledge in specific domains; manuals, treatises, newspaper a ticles, speeches, broadcastsand so forth for yet more details on anything and everything that humans find worth-whilecommunicating about.113In this paper we want to defend this point of view by making clear that all knowledge is necessarilydependent on representation.
According to Dik (1986, 1989) this representation takes the form ofeither perceptual images or verbal structures (section 2).
In section 3, we want to demonstrate hatknowledge ncoded in verbal structures i  reducible to grammatical e ements and lexical items(grammatical knowledge and lexical knowledge respectively).
The insights gained from our workwith machine readable dictionaries (MRDs) the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English,henceforth LDOCE, and the Van Dale dictionary of contemporary Dutch "Groot Woordenboek vanhet Hedendaags Nederlands", henceforth Van Dale, lead to the conclusion that lexical knowledgein the end is perceptual (in the form of primitive perceptual images) and grammatical (in the form ofgrammatical primitives).
This makes all linguistically expressed knowledge ultimatily reducible tothese primitives.
Since only linguistic knowledge is communicable, part of all knowledge is thusprivate (at least the knowledge corresponding to perceptual images).
The structure of lexicalknowledge as it emerges from our work, suggests a view on lexical meaning as not defining theobject a word stands for but as representing a typical (not necessarily unique) conceptualization fthat object (section 4).
This hypothesis about lexical knowledge leads to the conclusion (section 5)that there are differences between lexical knowledge and expert-domain knowledge, in that theobjective of the former is the use of a word as a symbol for a conceptualization f an object, andthe objective of the latter is to have knowledge on (all and any imaginable) properties of the objectitself.2 The representation of knowledgeKnowledge, of any kind, has to be stored in memory.
What is memoriT~hle can be distinguishedin perceptual information and conceptual knowledge.
What we perceive is of course influenced bythe concepts we have and, the other way round, concepts are partially based on our perception.Still there is a clear difference between perceptual information and conceptual representation in thatthe former is tied to the capacities of the sensory-apparatus and the latter to cognitive fimitations toprocess information.
In order to reduce the cognitive load of continuously processing and storingan enormous amount of data, the incoming information from the sensory apparatus i categorizedin terms of more general concepts which as much as possible abstract from irrelevant details.
Bystoring clusters of perceived features in terms of their conceptual categories all redundantinformation can be 'forgotten'.
This process of categorization has been described by Rosch (1977)in terms of two contrastive principles:i*ii.a concept aims at capturing as many features as possible shared by its instantiations; inother words to be as specific as possible.a concept aims at capturing as many instances as possible in order to reduce the number ofneeded categories; in other words to be as general as possible.Ideal categories are in balance with regard to both principles, and hence provide the most efficientunit to store information.
The cognitive system will therefore probably represent incominginformation as much as possible in terms o f  these ideal categories.
These conceptual categoriesthus constitute the building blocks of accumulating knowledge shaping, and being shaped, by theungoing processing of information.Any abstraction from actual experience, however, implies that there is some kind ofrepresentation system in which the concept is expressed.
Without representation k owledge cannotexist because there is no way to generalize over the individual experiences.
The category thatrepresents all prototypical instances has to be 'named' somehow to be able to attach information toit that applies to all these instances.
This dependence of knowledge or 'symbolization' hasimportant consequences.
As far as the above perceptual features are concerned there is evidence114that they are at least stored in terms of so-called prototype images (this also is intended to hold forperceptions as "smell", "emotions", touch", "taste", "hearing","movement").
These are a kind ofmental pictures which can 'be seen or experienced' through 'the mind's eye' and from which eveninferences can be drawn (e.g.
mental rotation tasks of three-dimensional objects having a two-dimensional representation, Shepard and Metzler 1977).
Not all knowledge, however, deals withperceptual features and this non-perceptual knowledge is therefore not bound to the perceptualapparatus of people.
Whatever perceptual features are stored by some prototypical image or mentalpicture of a 'bird', many of the corresponding concepts, for instance the fact that it is an 'animal'and therefore shares the feature 'living' with all other 'animals', cannot be captured by a purelyperceptual image.
Having a prototypical image of an 'animal' probably does not even make sense(although there may be a stereotypical best example of it, probably some kind of mammal),because instances of perceived 'animals' are more likely categorized in terms of more specific (andtherefore more informative) categories.
Non-l.rerceptual f cts, generalizing over individual cases,have to be represented bysome other conceptual language than perceptual images (other examplesof non-perceptual knowledge are e.g.
"social status', "kinship relations", skills", "capacities").Dik (1986, 1989, see also Weigand 1989, Meijs 1989) argues that any representation la guage fornon-perceptual knowledge, in addition to perceptual images, must be verbal for the followingreasons :i oii.. ?
.111.iv.If there is a common conceptual language for all rnarddnd, why are the actual naturallanguages so different from each other7How can we explain the great difficulties in translating if human beings are supposed tohave a common universal conceptual language?Why should speakers of natural languages have two systems to represent their information,a universal conceptual language and a natural anguage, when almost any conceivablecontent can be expressed innatural language?In practice, any actual description of conceptual structures uses words of some specificnatural language.
If there is a language independent representation system then what are itssymbols?Although the symbols of such a knowledge representation are tied to the actual content words oflanguages, Dik claims that the representation structure in which the content words are captured ismore abstract than the actual linguistic expressions of any one language.
Such a structure shouldrepresent all the functional communicative and compositional spects of linguistic expressionswhile at the same time it should abstrzct away from all language-dependent details of grammaticalexpression that are irrelevant from a conceptual point of view.
For instance, the fact that theexpression of information has a passive or active form is irrelevant because it does not affect herelation between entities designated by the expression.
This point is nicely illustrated by thefollowing two definitions in one and the same dictionary:Entry Word Dictionary Definit iona.
bray 2 0 n.b.
hee-haw 0 1 n.the sound that a donkey makesthe sound made by a donkey(Examples from LDOCE, 1978)Similarly, once the semantic interpretation of function words such as determiners, relativepronouns, prepositions, and of inflection information has been established in terms of argumentpositions, functions and operators in the grammar, these dements can be omitted from theunderlying structure.
The following, for instance, isa Functional Grammar representation forbothdefinitions:115a.
\[ d, s (xl) : soUndN (xl) : { maker \[ i, s (x2) : donkeyN (x2) \]Ag Subj \[ R (xl) \] GoObj } (xl) \]b .
\ [d ,s (x l ) :soUndN(x l ) :{makev\ [ i , s (x2) :donkeyN(x2) \ ]AgObj  [ (x l) \ ]GoSubj}(xl) \ ]The structure as a whole designates a term with an entity reference index "xl ".
The "d" and "s"before the first occurrence of "xl" stand for term operaators expressing definiteness and singularityrespectively.
Of "xl" two properties are stated: "donkey" and a complex property between braces.The complex property consists of an involvement of "x 1" (expressed by the eo-referentiality) in anevent designated by the main predicate "make".
The "xl" fills the second argument slot of bothstructures having the semantic function "Go" (Goal), whereas "x2" (classified as a "donkey") fillsthe first argument position of both structures ("i" and "s" are again term operators, "i" standing forindefinite), having the semantic function "Ag" (Agent).
The only differences between the twostructures are the assigment of the syntactic functions ubject and object ("Subj" and "Obj") and therelative pronoun marker "R'.
These differences lead to the two different surface structures, butthey do not affect he semantic interpretation of the structures, which is the same for both.Note that this view of knowledge allows concepts to be represented by complex structurescontaining several word senses.
Given the fact that the repertory of expressions in natural languageis theoretically unlimited, there is also no theoretical limitation on the possibility of representingsome concept in the underlying structure.3 The cyclic nature of linguistically expressed knowledgeThe advantage of taking a underlying linguistic-conceptual structure, which is claimed to beuniversal in Dik's theory of Functional Grammar (1989), as the format of representation is that itbrings knowledge within the scope of so-called linguistic knowledge: i.e.
knowledge is taken to bestored in verbal form.
Any knowledge, even expert knowledge or specialized symbolic systemssuch as the 'language' of mathematics or logic, has to have some interface with natural language tomake it communicable.
To make the same point Weigand (1989) refers to the work of Gardner(1987), who has studied knowledge representation in the legal domain.
She admits that despite therather sharply defined technical terms, many items, at some point, have to be grounded in ordinarylanguage.
A law on 'dogs' may define the term "own" but it does not define the word "dog" (theso-called open texture problem; Hart 1961).
The only solution is to relate expert or domainknowledge to general natural language.
Once the tools for analyzing natural language in terms of itssemantic ontent are available it is possible to squeeze knowledge out of any linguistic utteranceregardless of whether it is uttered as expert knowledge, broadcasts, peeches, newspaper articles,treatises, or in manuals.
For any utterance it will hold that its meaning can be explained in terms ofthe underlying linguistic-conceptual structure and the meaning of the content words that it contains:Meaning (expression) Meaning (underlying linguistic-conceptual structure)+Meaning (words)This means that expressions of expert knowledge in some natural language are subject o the samerules and restrictions imposed by the grammar on expressions of the language as a whole.
If welook at the following example of the entry "water" in the Encyclopaedia Brittanica (1977) thelanguage used to describe the knowledge is ordinary English, e.g.
:water 19:633, a familiar substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen andexisting in vapour, liquid, and several solid forms.
Water is essential to terrestrial life, participating116in virtuaUy every process that occurs in plant and animal organisms.
Although the molecules ofwater are simple in structure, the physical and chemical properties of the compound areextraordinarily complicated .... etc ....Many words are familiar and common English words used in their non-expert meanings.
Theexpert words used, such as "hydrogen" and "oxygen", can be looked up again, mostly in the samel ' l~Ource :hydrogen (from Greek hydro- and genes, "water former"), a colourless, odourless, tasteless,flammable, gaseous ubstance, the simplest member of the family of chemical elements; ...Schematically, all knowledge is thus necessarily related to linguistic knowledge in the followingway:Meaning (Expert word) = Meaning (Expert expression)Meaning (Expert expression) Meaning (underlying linguistic-conceptual structure)+Meaning (Expert words)+Meaning (Ordinary words)The meaning of the structure is defined in the grammar.
This definition takes care of very basicnotions and presuppositions such as 'entity', 'event', 'state', 'change of state', 'causality','control', 'location', 'time', 'semantic roles', 'quantification', 'countability', etc.
The rest of thecontent is based on the meaning of the ordinary words to be found in the lexicon as lexicalknowledge.
Thus, to profit from the wealthy electronic resource of linguistically expressedknowledge that is accumulating every day, it will be necessary to get a hold on the semantics oflinguistic utterances; that is to develop a grammar and provide a lexicon.
After that everythingdeserving of the description 'knowledge' (except perceptual or picturized knowledge) is fair gamefor lexical semantic hunters.In view of the essential character of knowledge as outlined above, it is not surprising thatlexical knowledge is stored in the form of expressions in natural language as well in dictionaries(although some dictionaries additionally also use pictures).
The same concentric arrangement asdescribed above can thus be applied to the lexical knowledge contained in dictionaries:Meaning (Ordinary word) = Meaning (Dictionary Expression)Meaning (Dictionary Expression) Meaning (underlying linguistic-conceptual stl"ucture)"6Meaning (Ordinary words)The combined explanations and illustrations can thus be thought of as constituting a huge relationalnetwork or grid which must by necessity have a non-trivial correspondence with the knowledgethat is being expressed.
Furthermore most explanations foUow a canonical format, so the relationalnetwork is also structured to a fairly high degree.
The study of machine-readable dictionaries inthe past decade or so has made it possible to trace the relational network inherent indictionary-definitions i  great detail.
While these kind of studies have shown that the inherentnetwork-organization is naturally far from perfect, they have also brought out that the overallcontours are nevertheless clearly recognizable.
When, for instance, this concentric principle issystematically applied to the genus words of dictionary definitions the words of a language thus117form hierarchical chains like the following examples ffi'om LDOCE:Entry Word Sense Dictionary definitionblue-bell 1flower 12plant 1thing 1object 1any of various blue bell-shapedflowersthe part of a plant, often beautiful and coloured, that produces eeds or fruita p/ant hat is grown for the beauty of this parta living thing that has leaves and roots, and grows usu.
in earth, esp.
thekind smaller than treesany material objecta thingThe entry words are decomposed via the genus terms in ever more general classes until,necessarily, a circularity occurs.
Such chains, which have been generated for LDOCE nouns andverbs and Van Dale nouns, tied together form a semantic lassification of the vocabulary of alanguage in terms of a small set of circularily defined words.
At least as far as nouns are concernedthe circular top of this hierarchy can be described in terms of a semantic typology (Vossen fc.
).This means that all nouns finally end up in a few typological primitives (collectives, individuals,masses), defined in the grammar.
This is of course not surprising in a dictionary like LDOCE (themachine-readable v rsion of which we studied in the LINKS-project), which uses a restrictedcontrolled vocabulary and starts from the stated aim of explaining the words which the user-learnermay not know in terms of words which he does know.
However, our investigation of the VanDale Dictionary of Contemporary Dutch in the context of the ESPRIT-project 'ACQUII.EX' hasshown that the inherent organization of this dictionary shows a broadly similar pattern, and wehave reason to assume that basically the same goes for any good general dictionary (of eg Amsler1980).The relevance of these chains is not so much to get at the typological status of words but tobe able to get at the properties or knowledge specified in the differentiae of the more general wordsin these chains, so that they can be inherited for the more specific words.
The fact that a "blue-bell"is "animate", for instance, is inherited via "flower" from the properties described in the definitionof "plant".
At the highest level in these hierarchies the definitions become rather void and no newproperties are added.
At this point lexical knowledge has been dissolved in all the propertiesspecified by the differentiae along the way, and the semantic primitive at the end.
If we look at thedifferentiae then they can basically be divided into stated properties and involvements in events.The latter facts can be represented in the underlying linguistic-conceptual sU'ucture as the fillers ofparticular slots of the predicate designating that event (in the above examples econd argument of"produce", and "grow", first argument of "have").
These slots can have various functions orroles, all of which are defined in terms of the semantics of the grammar (see section 2 for anexample of the underlying structure).
If, on the other hand, we trace down the static properties thatare expressed in the differentiae by looking up their definitions in LDOCE then it appears that theyoften designate perceptual features:Propert ies:blue 1colour 12having the colour bluethe quality which allows the eyes to see the difference between (forexample) a red flower and a blue flower when both are the same size andshapered, blue, green, black, brown, yellow, white, etc.bell-shapedbell n .

These properties at least justify a way ofrepresenting knowledge separate from the lexical means.
The verbal representation f thisknowledge can only be seen as a pointer to some non-verbal perceptual image.
In the end allconceptual knowledge is thus reducible to relations between words (contained in a underlyinglinguistic.conceptual structure) which can in their turn be related to grammatical primitives andperceptual images.

.Figure i. Layers of knowledgeThe lexical primitives that end up in sensory-motor experiences represented by perceptual imagesand grammatical primitives, can be used to describe the higher order concepts designated by theother words of the lexicon.
The vocabulary as a whole together with the grammar provides theequipment to represent any conceptual content within layman knowledge.
Along the same lines,although more strict and systematic, expert knowledge is in its turn anchored in basic laymanconcepts.Given the fact that only lexical knowledge is communicable, we have to conclude that someknowledge is private knowledge.
This seems to be very reasonable since, although we can ta lkquite happily about our visual, auditory and tactile (etc.)
experiences, it is ultimately impossible toactually communicate the essence of this kind of sensory-motor experience by lexical means.Instead, that requires exchanging the actual experience in some way or other (pointing to a colour,playing a tune, giving a blow, etc.).
When it comes to the crunch, there is a soft centre at the heartof any kind of lexical definition.
That soft centre is 'private meaning'.
However tight we weave theweb of words, we can never be certain that the concept one language-user associates with apartictdar word is exactly the same as that associated with it by another language-user.
Dictionarydefinitions, of any kind, can thus only be approxirnative, never exhaustive.4 The structure of lexical knowledgeSince all knowledge, in the end, reduces to relations between words, structural constraints on theserelations entailed by the lexicon are relevant o any kind of knowledge.
Each layer of knowledgeelaborates on what is given by the inner area.
Given the hypothesis that languages can expressanything, there is no restriction in expressing any piece of knowledge so that the anchoring inlexical knowledge only leaves room for a very weak version of the Sapir & Whorf hypothesis (thatlanguage may influence thought and therefore knowlege).
Despite that, we have evidence that thesynchronic results of the diachronic process of knowledge acquisition and lexicaliTation illustratethat there tendencies have played a role in the development of knowledge between lexical and120expert knowledge.
In a series of projects at the Univerisity of Amsterdam (ASCOT, LINKS) thesyntactic and semantic information i  LDOCE (and more recently in the framework of the Espritproject Acquflex, also the information contained in the Van Dale dictionaries of ContemporaryDutch) has been analysed and parsed (Akkerman e.a.
1988, Vossen 1990), and subsequentlystored in a database, so that it is now possible to have systematic access to this knowledge.
Fromstudying the classificational structures ( ee previous ection) that arise from it on a large scale andcross-linguistically (Vossen 1991, Vossen fc.)
several conclusions on the structure of lexicalknowledge can be drawn.
The main point to be made is that the way in which words are classifiedcan vary, as illustrated in figure 2, in which some of the relations at the top of the noun-hierarchyfrom LDOCE are given:obj act ...... thingI II I I Ifruit something plant beingI I II I I I Imater ia l  covering product vegetable personI I I II I I I Isubstance skin soap spice bodyI I I PART I PARTI I I I II leather curry-powder organ boneIII I I Il iquid food f lesh curdI I II I Icream soup meat Figure 2.
Hierarchical  relations in LDOCENot all 'substances' are also found below "substance": "soap", "spice" and "curry-powder" areclassified as 'products' instead.
A similar thing holds for "skin" and "flesh" which are primarilynot defined as 'bodypart' but as "covering" and "substance" respectively.
As for 'foods' what is'eatable' is also stored as "fruit", "vegetable", "Liquid", "flesh", or directly as "substance", whichdo not directly relate to the node "food".
These differences in classifying words via their definitioncan be mainly traced back to two different modes of defining in dictionaries.
Either theinvolvement of the designated object in some event is stressed, resulting in classes such as "food","covering", "product" (in most cases of concrete non-animate objects its function), or aconstitutional view is taken, as is the case with genus terms such as "substance", "Liquid", "PART-OF  body", "plant" ,"fruit", etc..If we compare the classifications in LDOCE with their equivalents (equivalent according tothe bilingual Dutch-English dictionary of Van Dale) in the hierarchy based on the Van Daledefinitions, then these differences become ven more striking.
Many EngLish words that aredefined as some "substance" in LDOCE (e.g.
"chocolate") have equivalent counterparts in Dutch(e.g.
"chocolade") which are primarily defined in terms of their function Cgenotmiddel" besttranslatable as "means of enjoying by ingesting").
The word "middel" (equivalent to English"means"), functions as a major node in the Dutch taxonomy, below which there are majorcompounds such as "vervoerrniddel" ("means of transport"), "hulpmiddel" ( means of help" or"instrument"), medicijnmiddel" ("means of curing" or "medicine"), "voedingsmiddel" ("means of121nutrition" or "food").
In English the word "means" has only been used for a very small set ofwords such as "mnemonics", "access", "approach" (the total number of word-senses related to it is3 I, whereas thousands of senses are related to the Dutch "middeI"), and the kind of compoundswhich naturally lead to "middel" in Dutch do not exist in English.
Instead of that English hasdifferent words that do not so ostensibly lead to a functional classification.
Figure 3 illustrates thedifference between the two hierarchies:Dutch  Ing l i shTaxonomy Taxonomymiddel< means >//////\\\\\\Ichocolade\[IIIIlautolI__MATCH IVIA BIL INGUAL DICT.MATCHVIA B IL INGUAL DICT.substancevehic le  /\ /\ /\ instrument /\ means /\ /\ / \  / \ /\ / \ /  .\Ioar I IchocolatelIIII\\\\\\\Figure 3.
Hierarchical  d i f ferences between LDOCE and Van DaleAlthough both languages are culturally and historically closely related, large parts of the Dutch andEnglish hierarchies differ considerably because the lexicographer's equipment o describe theconcepts i.e.
the vocabularies of the two languages and hence the conceptualizations enforcedby them - differ in crucial respects.
The Dutch lexicographers have probably been triggered by the"middel" compounds to relate them to the functional node "rniddel".
English lexicographers, on theother hand, were faced with words (such as "vehicle", "substance", "medicine", "food") that donot evoke "means" as a word for classification.There are two ways of dealing with this variation in defining.
Either the lexicographers have beeninconsistent and one way of defining should be preferred over the other (although this may bemore difficult to formulate in some cases than in others), or the work of lexicographers, inprinciple, is to be taken seriously and the fact that these words are differently classified ismeaningful (in practice, examples of both interpretations can be found).
The latter view is mostrelevant for our discussion because it implies that lexical meaning is not always the same asequivalence according to a bilingual dictionary.
Although Dutch "chocolade" and English"chocolate" are equivalent translation pairs, they still have different lexical meanings.
Fortranslation purposes, substitution of words in all contexts is a sufficient criterion.
Words,however, can have the same referential meaning but still stand for different concepts (Frege's Sinnund Bedeutung).
In this view the lexical meaning as described in dictionary definitions would betaken to stand for a particular conceptualization f a possible set of referents, whereas that same setof referents can also be conceptualized in many other ways.
In this sense dictionary definitions donot 'define' the object of reference, that is give the List of properties that uniquely discriminate itfrom all other objects, but merely tell you that using this word means that you have to look at the122object from this perspective (conceptualize it in such and such way).
Within such a view of lexicalmeaning, variation in classification asin the follwing examples makes ense:Entry Word Dictionary Definitionarmourblanketcarpetdaubstrong protective covering on fighting vehicles,...a thick, esp.
woollen covering...heavy woven often woollen mater/a/for covering floors or stairs(a) soft sticky mazeria/for covering surfaces like walls(Examples from LDOCE, 1978)When using the word "blanket" or "armour" to refer to some object you are told to look at itprimarily as a "covering" and secondarily as some kind of "material", whereas "carpet" and"daub", as defined here, stress the constitution of the object instead of its function "covering".5 Different objectives of lexical and expert-domain knowledgeThe view on general lexical knowledge developed above makes it to a certain degree different fromother types of knowledge.
Expert knowledge, and to some extent also part of the laymanknowledge deals with knowledge about he object, whereas in case of general lexical knowledgenot knowledge about the object but knowing that a particular word stands for a particularconceptualization (that can be used to refer to a corresponding objec0 is the goal.
This perfectly fitsin with the lexicographer's tradition of describing the semantic properties of words, in which the'use of words' has always prevailed and not the knowledge about he object.
A word as such is nomore than a vehicle of information within a particular context.
This does not necessarily imply thatthe 'meaning of a word' (the information it carries over) equals all the knowledge people have onthe object or class of objects that is designated by that word, as is obvious (at least since Galileo)from the following examples:Entry Word Dictionary Definitionsunrisesunsetthe time when the sun is seen to appear after the nightthe time when the sun is seen to disappear s night begins(Examples from LDOCE, 1978)sunrisesunsetthe apparent rising of the sun above the horizonthe apparent descent of the sun below the horizon(Examples from Webster, 1974)zonsopgang(sunrise)zonsondergang(sunset)opgaan van de zon(rising-above of the sun)bet ondergaan van de zon(the descending-below f the sun)(Examples from Van Dale, 1984.
)The words "sunrise" and "sunset" will probably be used in collocations that trigger theconceptualization associated with the words and not the knowledge we have about "stars","planets" and their "orbits".
Exactly these collocations form the material for lexicographers toextract the lexical meanings of words.Furthermore, words not only give different conceptualizations f the same object but can123also function as a vehicle of attitudinal nd social information, as in the following synonymousvariants found in LDOCE on the basis of similar definitions:Entry Word Dictionary Definitionbobbyb~~pperflatfootpeelerpigc~infml BrE a policemansl, esp.
AmE a policemaninfml a policemansl a policemanBrE oM sl a policemansl policemaninfml policeman (Examples from LDOCE, 1978)All these words designate he same set of potential referents, but they all carry a different attitudinalor social signal along expressed by the labels "infml" (=informal), "sl" (=slang), "AmE"(=American English), "BrE" ( Bfittish English), "old" (=obselete), which tell us in what kind ofcontext the words can be found (or used) but which has little to do with the 'knowledge we have ofpolicemen'.As a consequence of these different objectives of lexical and expert-domain knowledge, theconnection between the different layers of knowledge, as represented in figure 1, is not allwaysthat smooth.
For some domains in which the process of lexicalizafion has clearly been triggered bythe straightforward acquisition of knowledge through science and education, such as animal andplant names, there may be a rather regular connection between lexical, layman and expertknowledge in which more and more detailed information is added.
As such part of the expertknowledge has become general lexical knowledge as well over time (perhaps a process in parallelto that of "Gesunkenes Kulturgut").
However in many domains, and even in animal and plantnames (e.g.
compare the functional "watchdog", sheepdog", pet" with the different species ofanimal in terms of their constitution), other conceptual~tions of objects cross-classify with e.g.expert knowledge.
Lexical knowledge thus gives you a wider range of views than expertknowledge.
Something in the external world can be looked upon from all kinds of perspectivescorrelating with different words.
For instance, while in Dutch we can use either "theewater"(literally "tea water") or "koffiewater" (literally "coffee water") to refer to the water that we areputting on to boil depending on its intended use, it would still be H20 to the expert.
Although theexpert's knowledge of "water" is more specific, the linguistic equipment to refer to "water"illustrates a greater variation in possible perspectives.
In this sense, expert knowledge can be seenas more demilled and systematic subtype of lexical knowledge from a more resu'icted perspective.Where we expect hat expert knowledge is exhaustive and defining, lexical knowledge thus istypical and associative but hardly ever exhaustive.
Only those properties are described whichtypically mark the conceptualization that is associated with it.124References:Akkerman E., H. Voogt-van Zutpben, and W. Meijs,"A computerized lexicon for word-level tagging", Ascot report No 2.
