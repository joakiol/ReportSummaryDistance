This work uses a dataset of nar-rated image-based clinical reasoning, col-lected from physicians as they diagnoseddermatological cases presented as images.Two annotators with training in cognitivepsychology assigned each narrative a rat-ing on a four-point decision scale, from in-tuitive to analytical.
This work discussesthe annotation study, and makes contribu-tions for resource creation methodologyand analysis in the clinical domain.1 IntroductionPhysicians make numerous diagnoses daily, andconsequently clinical decision-making strate-gies are much discussed (e.g., Norman, 2009;Croskerry, 2003, 2009).
Dual process theory pro-poses that decision-making may be broadly cat-egorized as intuitive or analytical (Kahneman &Frederick, 2002; Stanovich & West, 2000).
Fur-ther, scholars argue that decision-making may beordered on a continuum, with intuitive and analyt-ical at each pole (Hamm, 1988; Hammond, 1981).Determining the decision strategies used byphysicians is of interest because certain styles maybe more appropriate for particular tasks (Ham-mond, 1981), and better suited for expert physi-cians rather than those in training (Norman, 2009).Language use can provide insight into physiciandecision style, as linguistic content reflects cogni-tive processes (Pennebaker & King, 1999).While most clinical corpora focus on patientsor conditions, physician diagnostic narratives havebeen successfully annotated for conceptual units(e.g., identifying medical morphology or a differ-ential diagnosis), by Womack et al.
(2013) andMcCoy et al.
(2012).
Crowley et al.
(2013) cre-ated an instructional system to detect cognitive bi-ases in clinical decision-making, while Coderre etal.
(2003) used protocol analysis on think-alouddiagnostic narratives, and found that features ofintuitive reasoning implied diagnostic accuracy.In this study, speech data were collected fromphysicians as they diagnosed dermatological casespresented to them as images.
Physician verbaliza-tions were annotated for decision style on a four-point scale from intuitive to analytical (Figure 1).Importantly, cognitive psychologists were broughtinto the loop for decision style annotation, to takeadvantage of their expertise in decision theory.Figure 1: The decision-making continuum, show-ing the four-point rating scale.

Conclusions from the pilot study enhanced the mainannotation study.
To ensure high-quality annotation, narratives appeared in random order, and 10% (86)of narratives were duplicated and evenly distributed in the annotation data, to later assess intra-annotatorreliability.
Questionnaires were also interspersed at 5 equal intervals to study annotator strategy.discussed theoretically.
Thus, it responds to theneed for investigating subjective natural languagephenomena (Alm, 2011).
The annotated corpus isa springboard for decision research in medicine,as well as other mission-critical domains in whichgood decisions save lives, time, and money.Subjective computational modeling is particu-larly challenging because often, no real ?groundtruth?
is available.
Decision style is such afuzzy concept, lacking clear boundaries (Hamp-ton, 1998), and its recognition develops in psy-chologists over time, via exposure to knowledgeand practice in cognitive psychology.
Interpretingfuzzy decision categories also depends on mentalmodels which lack strong intersubjective agree-ment.
This is the nature, and challenge, of cap-turing understandings that emerge organically.This work?s contributions include (1) present-ing a distinct clinical resource, (2) introducing arobust method for fuzzy clinical annotation tasks,(3) analyzing the annotated data comprehensively,and (4) devising a new metric that links annotatedbehavior to clinicians?
decision-making profiles.2 Corpus DescriptionIn an experimental data-collection setting, 29physicians (18 residents, 11 attendings) narratedtheir diagnostic thought process while inspecting30 clinical images of dermatological cases, for atotal of 8681narratives.
Physicians described ob-servations, differential and final diagnoses, andconfidence (out of 100%) in their final diagno-sis.
Later, narratives were assessed for correctness(based on final diagnoses), and image cases wereevaluated for difficulty by a dermatologist.3 Corpus Annotation of Decision StyleThe corpus was annotated for decision style in apilot study and then a main annotation study (Fig-1Two physicians skipped 1 image during data collection.ure 2).2Two annotators with graduate trainingin cognitive psychology independently rated eachnarrative on a four-point scale from intuitive to an-alytical (Figure 1).
The two middle labels reflectthe presence of both styles, with intuitive (BI) oranalytical (BA) reasoning being more prominent.Since analytical reasoning involves detailed exam-ination of alternatives, annotators were asked toavoid using length as a proxy for decision style.After the pilot, the annotators jointly dis-cussed disagreements with one researcher.
Inter-annotator reliability, measured by linear weightedkappa (Cohen, 1968), was 0.4 before and 0.8 af-ter resolution; the latter score may be an upperbound on agreement for clinical decision-makingannotation.
As both annotators reported usingphysician-provided confidence to judge decisionstyle, in subsequent annotation confidence men-tions had been removed if they appeared after thefinal diagnosis (most narratives), or, if intermixedwith diagnostic reasoning, replaced with dashes.Finally, silent pauses3were coded as ellipses toaid in the human parsing of the narratives.4 Quantative Annotation AnalysisTable 1 shows the annotator rating distributions.4I BI BA AA1 89 314 340 124A2 149 329 262 127Table 1: The distribution of ratings across the4-point decision scale.

Intra-annotator reliabilitywas calculated for the narratives rated twice, andinter-annotator reliability on the initial ratings.As shown in Table 2, reliability was moderate togood (Altman, 1991), and inter-annotator agree-ment was well above chance (25%).
Indeed, an-notators were in full agreement, or agreed withinone rating on the continuum, on over 90% of nar-ratives.
This pattern reveals fuzzy category bound-aries but sufficient regularity so as to be mea-surable.
This is in line with subjective naturallanguage phenomena, and may be a consequenceof imposing discrete categories on a continuum.5Annotator 1 had better intra-annotator reliability,perhaps due to differences in annotation strategy.5Nonetheless, affect research has shown that scalar repre-sentations are not immune to variation issues (Alm, 2009).5 Annotator Strategy AnalysisFive questionnaires evenly spaced among the nar-ratives asked annotators to rate how often theyused various factors in judging decision style (Ta-ble 3).
Factors were chosen based on discussionwith the annotators after the pilot, and referred toin descriptions of decision styles in the annotatorinstructions; the descriptions were based on char-acteristics of each style in the cognitive psychol-ogy literature (e.g., Evans, 2008).
Factors withhigh variability (SD columns in Table 3) revealchanges in annotator strategy over time, and fac-tors that may influence intra-annotator reliability.Both annotators reported using the rel.
(similar-ity) of final & first-mentioned diagnosis, as well asperceived attitude, perceived confidence, and useof justification, to rate most narratives.
Types ofprocessing were used by both sometimes; this isimportant since these are central to the definitionsof decision style in decision-making theory.Differences in strategies allow for the assess-ment of annotators?
individual preferences.
Anno-tator 1 often considered the no.
of diagnoses in thedifferential, and rel.
timing of the differential, butAnnotator 2 rarely attended to them; the oppositepattern occurred with respect to switching betweendecision styles, and the timing of the switch.The shared high factors reveal those consis-tently linked to interpreting decision style, despite85the concept?s fuzzy boundaries.
In contrast, the id-iosyncratic high factors reveal starting points forunderstanding fuzzy perception, and for furthercalibrating inter-annotator reliability.6 Narrative Case StudyExamining particular narratives is also instructive.Of the 86 duplicated narratives with two ratingsper annotator, extreme agreement occurred for 22cases (26%), meaning that all four ratings were ex-actly the same.6Figure 3 (top) shows such a caseof intuitive reasoning: a quick decision without re-flection or discussion of the differential.
Figure3 (middle) shows a case of analytical reasoning:consideration of alternatives and logical inference.Figure 3: Narratives for which annotators were infull agreement on I (top) and A (middle) ratings,vs.
in extreme disagreement (bottom).In the full data set (initial ratings), there were50 cases (6%) of 2-point inter-annotator disagree-ment and one case of 3-point inter-annotator dis-agreement (Figure 3, bottom).
This latter narra-tive was produced by an attending (experiencedphysician), 40% confident and incorrect in the fi-nal diagnosis.
Annotator 1 rated it analytical,while Annotator 2 rated it intuitive.
This is inline with Annotator 1?s preference for analyticalratings (Table 1).

preferred decision style.
A decision scorewas calculated for each physician as follows:dp=12nn?i=1(rA1i+ rA2i) (1)where p is a physician, r is a rating, n is totalimages, and A1, A2 the annotators.
Annotators?initial ratings were summed ?
from 1 for Intuitiveto 4 for Analytical ?
for all image cases for eachphysician, and divided by 2 times the number ofimages, to normalize the score to a 4-point scale.Figure 4 shows the distribution of decision scoresacross residents and experienced attendings.Residents exhibit greater variability in decisionstyle.
While this might reflect that residents werethe majority group, it suggests that differences inexpertise are linked to decision styles; such differ-ences hint at the potential benefits that could comefrom preparing clinical trainees to self-monitortheir use of decision style.
Interestingly, the over-all distribution is skewed, with a slight preferencefor analytical decision-making, and especially sofor attendings.
This deserves future attention.Figure 4: Decision score distribution by expertise.8 ConclusionThis study exploited two layers of expertise:physicians produced diagnostic narratives, andtrained cognitive psychologists annotated for de-cision style.
This work also highlights the impor-tance of understanding annotator strategy, and fac-tors influencing annotation, when fuzzy categoriesare involved.
Future work will examine the linksbetween decision style, expertise, and diagnosticaccuracy or difficulty.86AcknowledgementsWork supported by a CLA Faculty Dev.
