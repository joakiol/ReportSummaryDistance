Proceedings of NAACL HLT 2009: Tutorials, pages 11?12,Boulder, Colorado, June 2009. c?2009 Association for Computational LinguisticsOntoNotes: The 90% SolutionSameer S. Pradhan and Nianwen XueOntoNotes is a five year multi-site collaboration between BBN Technologies, Information Sciences In-stitute of University of Southern California, University of Colorado, University of Pennsylvania and Bran-deis University.
The goal of the OntoNotes project is to provide linguistic data annotated with a skeletalrepresentation of the literal meaning of sentences including syntactic parse, predicate-argument structure,coreference, and word senses linked to an ontology, allowing a new generation of language understandingtechnologies to be developed with new functional capabilities.In its third year of existence, the OntoNotes project has generated a large amount of high quality datacovering various layers of linguistic annotation.
This is probably the first time that data of such quality hasbeen available in large quantities covering multiple genres (newswire, broadcast news, broadcast conver-sation and weblogs) and languages (English, Chinese and Arabic).
The guiding principle has been to finda ?sweet spot?
in the space of inter-tagger agreement, productivity, and depth of representation.
The mosteffective use of this resource for research requires simultaneous access to multiple layers of annotation.
Thishas been made possible by representing the corpus with a relational database to accommodate the denseconnectedness of the data and ensure consistency across layers.
In order to facilitate ease of understandingand manipulability, the database has also been supplemented with a object-oriented Python API.The tutorial consists of two parts.
In the first part we will familiarize the user with this new resource,describe the various layers of annotations in some detail and discuss the linguistic principles and some-times practical considerations behind the important design decisions that shapes the corpus.
We will alsodescribe the salient differences between the three languages at each layer of annotation and how linguisticpeculiarities of different languages were handled in the data.In the second part, we will describe the data formats of each of the layers and talk about various designdecisions that went into the creation of the architecture of the database and the individual tables comprisingit, along with issues that came up during the representation process and compromises that were madewithout sacrificing some primary objectives one of which being the independent existence of each layerthat is necessary to allow multi-site collaboration.
We will explain how the database schema attempts tointerconnect all the layers.
Then we will go into the details of the Python API that allows easy access to eachof the layers and show that by making the objects closely resemble database tables, the API allows for theirflexible integration.
This will be followed by a hands-on working session.1 Tutorial Outline1.

Detailed knowledge of any ofthe layers is not necessary.
Some familiarity with Python would be preferable.Sameer Pradhan is a Research Scientist at BBN Technologies.
