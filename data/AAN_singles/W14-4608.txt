We address data design issues and the methodfor data collection using a purposely designed application for mobile devices.
We also discussthe application of the data including the design and collection of a small speech corpus to cov-er the commands used to control a robotic arm in Welsh on a Raspberry Pi computer the li-censing of the project and our hopes for the application of the project resources to other lan-guages.1 IntroductionThis paper presents an overview of the GALLU (Gwaith Adnabod Lleferydd Uwch- IPA: [?a??
], trans-lation: further speech recognition work) project to develop speech recognition technology for theWelsh language.
Wales has a population of around 3 million people, of whom around 20% speakWelsh (Office for National Statistics, 2012).
Lesser-resourced languages typically lag in digital inno-vation, including in language technologies.
However since 2012, the Welsh Government has updatedand revised a strategy for supporting Welsh-language technology.
Emphasis is placed on ?more toolsand resources ?
to facilitate the use of Welsh, including in the digital environment?
(Welsh Govern-ment, 2012: 45) and ?the development of new Welsh-language software applications and digital ser-vices?
(Welsh Government, 2013; 12).
With funding from the Welsh Government and S4C (the Welshlanguage television channel), the GALLU project aims to develop speech recognition technology forthe Welsh language.
The resources will be available under a permissive open-source licence, and willtherefore be available for use in a broad spectrum of platforms and devices, including voice control forsmart televisions.2 Previous speech technology for WelshPrior to the GALLU project, the most substantial work on Welsh speech technology was developedunder the WISPR (Welsh and Irish Speech Processing Resources) project (Prys et al., 2004).
Previouswork on a diphone-based synthesiser (Williams, 1994; 1995) and also a small speech database forWelsh (Williams, 1999) was built upon by the WISPR project.
An improved synthetic Welsh voicewas developed as part of the WISPR project as well as an MSAPI interface to Festival for use in Mi-crosoft Windows environments (Bangor University Text to Speech, [no date]).
Following the releaseof the WISPR resources under an open-source (BSD) licence, further work was facilitated to developcommercial Welsh voices by the Language Technologies Unit at Bangor University, by the Finnishcompany Bitlips (Bitlips Text to Speech, [no date]) and the Polish company Ivona (Ivona Text toSpeech, [no date]).
A ?Basic Welsh speech recognition" (Bangor University, [no date]) project at theLanguage Technologies Unit at Bangor University in 2008-9 resulted in laboratory prototypes for a) a?command and control?
application for a PC where applications could be launched by voice controland b) a simple voice-driven calculator.
The GALLU project will build on this to develop furtherWelsh speech recognition resources.This work is licenced under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.

Licence details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/553 Data designThe Welsh language has up to 29 consonants and a large number of vowels: up to 13 monophthongsand 13 diphthongs dependent on the variety (Awbery, 1984; Ball, 1984; Jones, 1984; Ball and Wil-liams, 2001; Mayr and Davies, 2011; amongst others).
In order to collect the appropriate data to trainan acoustic model within HTK ([no date]), a set of phonetically rich words has been designed for con-tributors to read aloud.
In designing the prompt set it was important to ensure that a small number ofprompts contain representations of all of the phonemes in the language.
The WISPR project?s letter-to-sound rules were rewritten based on data mining from a lexicon, and a list of the most common soundsand words was extracted from a text corpus.
The final prompt set will contain approximately 200prompts (8 words per prompt) covering all of the phonemes in the language which may be recorded bycontributors across different sessions.

The next steps forthe project involve further data collection and linguistic model development.4 Data collection: crowdsourcing and the Paldaruo ApplicationA large number of speakers are required in order to train the acoustic model which forms the basis ofthe speech recognition system.
Recruiting speakers to attend a recording session at a sound booth withrecording software can prove expensive and time consuming.
In attempting to tackle this issue, acrowdsourcing approach is being used as a method for collecting data.
Crowdsourcing is a low-costand efficient way of collecting speech data.A mobile application ?Paldaruo?
(Welsh for ?chattering?)
has been developed for iOS and Androiddevices.
Such devices, with inbuilt microphones and internet connectivity, provide a convenientmechanism for many volunteers to contribute speech corpus data.
The app is optimised for ease of usein order to maximise potential contributions.Each volunteer creates their own profile within the app providing metadata related to sex, age, lin-guistic characteristics and geographical background.
Following this, the volunteers explicitly agree totheir contributions being collected and used.
The prompts, described above, are presented one at a timeand the volunteer records each one individually.
The recording is replayed and the volunteer verifiesthe quality or re-records.
The user can stop and resume at any time.
Prompts are provided to the volun-teer in a random order; completed prompts will be included in the corpus even if the user does not rec-ord the full set.The app accesses the microphone of the user?s mobile device and records 48 kHz PCM files, whichare sent to a server developed and hosted by the Language Technologies Unit at Bangor University.Uploads are queued in the background so that network speed issues do not interrupt the recording pro-cess.56Translation:PaldaruoCrowdsourcing a Welsh speech recognition corpusHelp us to develop Welsh speech recognition.Contribute your voice through nattering into thisapp.Funders:S4C Welsh GovernmentBegin >More information?Figure 1: Welcome screen in the Paldaruo AppThe app was evaluated in a pilot application (see 5) and proved successful in obtaining a useful speechcorpus from invited volunteers.
However issues were highlighted with regards to background noiseand recording volume levels.
To address this, the app now includes background noise and volume lev-el checks.The official media launch of the app, with the final prompt set, will take place on 7th July 2014.
Therewill be television coverage on S4C with high-profile individuals including the First Minister of Walesand celebrities providing endorsements and appeals for volunteers.5 Data Application5.1 Pilot Data ApplicationTo date a small pilot speech corpus has been collected with the Paldaruo app covering the phonemesthat appear in a vocabulary to control a robotic arm.
20 speakers contributed to this corpus and record-ed 38 prompts (approx.
200 words) each, totalling around 4000 words.
Certain commands, for instance?up?, exhibit dialect-dependent lexical variation, and in these cases every speaker recorded both re-gional forms.Command:                                                               Translation:golau ymlaen                       light ongafael agor                        grip opengafael cau                         grip closearddwrn i fyny / arddwrn lan       wrist uparddwrn i lawr                     wrist downpenelin i fyny / penelin lan       elbow uppenelin i lawr                     elbow downysgwydd i fyny / ysgwydd lan       shoulder upysgwydd i lawr                     shoulder downtroi i?r dde                       turn to the righttroi i?r chwith                    turn to the leftThis corpus has been used to develop a pilot speaker-independent Welsh-language speech recognitionsystem for controlling the robotic arm.
The pilot system uses HTK ([no date]) and Julius ([no date]),and follows the design of an existing English system (AonSquared, [no date]).
It controls the roboticarm from a Raspberry Pi (a credit card-sized computer, popular in schools and coding clubs, costingaround ?35; see (Raspberry Pi Foundation, [No date]).
The authors hope this simple demonstrationwill be recreated in schools and coding clubs for children throughout Wales, fitting in with the Welsh57Government?s aim to support initiatives aimed at encouraging and supporting young people to engage?in the digital world in a Welsh-language context?
(Welsh Government, 2013: 14).5.2 LicensingGALLU will follow the successful strategy of the WISPR project in using permissive open-source li-censing.
All outputs will be made available under the MIT licence (MIT, [No date]) which allows roy-alty-free use in both open-source and proprietary systems, including desktop computer software, webapplications, mobile apps and embedded systems such as television set firmware.This strategy allows the widest possible use of the project?s outputs, and the maximal availability ofWelsh speech recognition technology.5.3 Application to other languagesThe authors hope other lesser-resourced languages can harness the project?s outputs and experience.The source code of the Paldaruo crowdsourcing app can easily be adapted for use in other languages.The process for developing the LVCSR system has been documented and will be published in theform of a tutorial.
All project outputs, including the source code for the app, will be available underthe MIT licence.ReferencesAonSquared.
