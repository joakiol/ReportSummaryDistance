Allen et al 1987; Hertz 1981~ 1982, forthcoming;Hertz et aL 1985) are, at heart, unconstrained string-based transformational grammars.
Generally, text-to-speech programs are implemented as the compo-sition of three non-invertible mappings:1. grapheme to phoneme mapping (inverse spellingr ales + exceptions dictionary)2. phoneme to allophone mapping (pronunciationrules)3. allophone to parameter mapping (interpolationrules)\])'or example:ph\] %, pit\[p'\] ~-- /p /  ~-- sip\[p-\] e / spitallophones ~ phonemes ,--- graphemesh denotes trong release of breath (aspiration)' denotes light/weak aspiration- denotes no aspirationThese mappings are usually defined using rules ofthe form A -+ B /U  D e.g.
(1), usually called"context-sensitive", but which in fact define unre-stricted rewriting systems, since B may be the emptystring (Gazdar 1.987).
It should be recalled that "ifall we can say about a grammar of a natural anguageis that it is an unrestricted rewriting system, we havesaid nothing of any interest" (Chomsky 1963:360).
(1) p --, p-/s__e lse  p --, ph/__V(where V is any vowel symbol)else p --~ p'Often, of course, grammars made with rules of thistype may be (contingently) quite restricted.
For in.-stance, if the rules apply in a fixed order withoutcyclicity, they may be compiled into a finite-statetransducer (Johnson 1972).
But in general thereis no guarantee that a program which implementssuch a grammar will halt.
This would be prettydisastrous in speech recognition, and is undesirableeven in generation-based applications, such as text-to-speech.
However, this has not prevented the at>pearance of a number of "linguistic rule compilers"such as Van Leenwen's (1987, 1989) and Hertz's sys.-gems.Tile basic operations of a transformational gram?mar - -  deletion, insertion, permutation, and copying- -  are apparently empirically instantiated by suchwell-established phonological phenemona s elision,epenthesis, metathesis, assimilation and coarticula-tion.Copying (i): Assimilatione.g.

There is no principled 1 way of limiting the do-main of rule application to specific linguistic do-mains, such as syllables.4.
Using sequences as data-structures is really onlyplausible if all speech parameters change withnlore-or-less equal regularity.1N.B.

pFigure 1: Richer structure in phonological represen-tationsIn partial recognition of some of these problems, pho-nologists have been attemptiug to reconstruct thetransformational component as the epiphenomenalresult of several interacting eneral "constraints".Numerous uch "constraints" and ~principles" havebeen proposed, such as the Well-Formedness Con-dition (Goldsmith 1976 and several subsequent for-nmlations), the Obligatory Contour Principle (Leben1973), Cyclicity (Kaisse and Shaw 1985, Kiparsky1985), Structure-Preservation (Kiparsky 1985), theElsewhere Condition (Kiparsky 1973) etc.
Whilethis line of research is in some respects conceptuallycleaner than primitive transformational grammars,there has been no demonstration that a "principle'-based phonology is indeed more restrictive thanprimitive transformational phonology in any compu-rationally relevant dimension.A declarative model of speech For the last fewyears, I have been developing a "synthesis-by-rule"program which does not employ such string-to-stringtransformations (Coleman and Local 1987 forthcom-ing; Local 1989 forthcoming; Coleman 1989).The basic hypothesis of this (and related) research isthat there is a trade-off between the richness of therule component and the richness of the representa-tions (Anderson 1985).
According to this hypothesis,the reason why transformational phonology needs touse transformations is because its data structure,strings, is too simple.
Consequently, it ought to bepossible to considerably simplify or even completelyeliminate the transformational rule component byusing more elaborate data structures than just well-ordered sequences of letters or feature-vectors.
Forinstance if we use graphs {fig.
1) to represent phono-logical objects, then instead of copying, we can im-80Tongue-back: ANYI~Ibngue-tip: CLOSUREINasality: +Tongue-back: CLOSURE Tongue-back: CLOSUREI ITongue-tip: ANY Tongue4ip: CLOSUREI ?~ / \Nasality: - Nasality: + Nasa l i ty : -k ,) kFigure 2: Declarative characterisation f assimilationplement harmony phenomena using the structure-,dlaring technique.
:(ncorpora~ing richer data-structures allows many ifnot all rewriting rules to be abandoned, to the extentJ~hat the transformational rewrite-rule mechanismcan be ditched, along with the problems it brings.Consider how the "processes" discussed above canbe given a declarative (or "configurational") analy-sis.Allophony can be regarded as the different interpre-tation of t:he same element in different structural con-~exts, rather than as involving several slightly differ-ent phonological objects instantiating each phoneme.Onset Coda Onseti i / \p p s p\[ph\] \[p,\] \[p\]Aspirated Slightly UnaspiratedaspiratedAssimilation can also be modelled non-destructivelyby unification (fig.
2).Coarticulation is simple to model if parametric pho-netic representations may be glued together in par-allel, rather than simply concatenated.
Consonantsmay then overlaid over vowels, rather than simplyconcatenated to them (Ohman \]966, Perkell 1969,Gay 1977, Mattingly 1981, Fowler 1983).
If required,~his analysis can also be implemented in the phono-logical component, using graphs of the 'overlap' re-lation (Griffen 1985, Bird and Klein 1990): e.g.

3).It has been demonstrated (Fourakis 1980, Kelly andLocal 1989) that epenthetic elements are not phonet-ically identical to similar non-epenthetic elements.The transformational analysis, however, holds thatthe phonetic implementation f a segment is depen-dendent on its features, not its derivatonal history('% \[t\] is a It\] is a It\]'), and thus incorrectly predictsthat an epenthetic \[t\] should be phonetically identi-ca.1 to any other It\].Elision is the inverse of epenthesis, and is thus insome sense "the same" phenomenon, taking the "un-elided': form as more primitive than the "elided"form, a decision which is entirely meaningless in thedeclarative account (fig.
4)Metathesi3 is another instance of "the same" phe-nomenon i.e.
different temporal synchronisation ofan invariant set of elements.
Epenthesis, Elision andMetathesis may all be regarded as instances of themore general phenomenon ofnon-significant variabil-ity ill the timing of parallel events.81Figure 5: Phrase structure grammar of English phoneme stringsWord Word\[+inflected\] -~ \[-inflected\] Inflection Inflection e.g.

etc.82U U\ /r i"As well as these relatively low-level phonologicalphenomena, work in Metrical Phonology (Church1985) and Dependency Phonology (Anderson andJones 1974) has shown how stress assignment, aparadigm example for transformational phonology,can be given a declarative analysis.Overview of text - to -parameter  conversion inthe YorkTalk system1.
Each symbol in the input text string is trans-lated into a column-vector of distinctive pho-netic features (nasal, vowel, tongue-back, etc.
)Sequences of letters are thus translated into se-quences of feature-structures.2.
The sequence of feature-structures is parsed.This process translates the sequence into adirected graph representing the phonologicalconstituent structure of the utterance.3.
The phonological structure is traversed and aninterpretation function applied at each node toderive a phonetic parameter matrix.Parsing is done using a Phrase Structure Grammarof phoneme strings.
A very simplified version of sucha grammar is fig.
5.
I have implemented several suchgrammars o far, including a DCG implementationand a PATR-II-like implementation.
With one ortwo simple extensions to the grammar formalism, itis also possible to parse re-entrant (e.g.
ambisyllabic)structures and other overlapping structures, such asthose arising from bracketting "paradoxes".
The re-suiting graphs are thus not trees, but directed acyclicgraphs.In computational syntactic theory, one of the mainuses for the parse-tree of a string is to direct theconstruction of a compositional (Fregean) semanticinterpretation, according to the rule-to-rule hypoth-esis (Bach 1976).
In the YorkTalk system, the sameapproach is employed to assign a phonetic interpre-tation to the phonological representation.
A sec-ond, theory-internal motivation for constructing richparse-graphs of the phonemic string is that it enablesthe phoneme string to be discarded completely, thusliberating the phonetic interpretation function fromthe sequentiality and other undesirable properties ofseglnental strings.After the phonological graph has been constructedby the parser, a head-first graph-traversal lgorithmmaps the (partial) phonological category of eachnode into equations describing the time-dependentmotion of the synthesis parameters for specified in-telwals of time.
These parametric time-functions arefinally instantiated with actual numbers represent-ing times, in order to derive a complete matrix of(parameter, value) pairs.As well as being computationally "clean", thismethod of synthesis has the additional merit of beinggenuinely non-segmental in (at least) two respects:there are no segments in the phonological representa-tions, and there is no cross-parametric segmentationin the phonetic representations.
The resulting speechdoes not manifest the discontinuities and rapid cross-parametric hanges which often cause clicks, pops,and the other disfiuencies which typify some syn-thetic speech.
On the contrary, the speech is fluent,articulate and very human-like.
When the modelis wrong in some respect, it sounds like a speakerof a different language or dialect, or someone withdysfluent speech.
For all these reasons, the York-Talk model is attracting considerable interest in thespeech technlogy industry and research commulfity, acircumstance which I hope will promote awidespreadchange of approach to computational phonology infuture.References\[1\] Allen, J., S. Hunnicutt and D. Klatt.
