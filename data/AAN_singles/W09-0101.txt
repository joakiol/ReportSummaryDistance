Indoing so, it focuses on the interaction betweenanalytical philosophy and machine translationdevelopment,  trying  to  draw  the  emergingmethodological analogies.1 IntroductionPhilosophical accounts of science and respectivetechnological development bear a tight interrela-tion  and  continuous  interplay.
Likewise,  philo-sophical  investigations  of  language  bear  theirown implications on how technology processinglanguage,  in  monolingual  or  multilingual  set-tings, evolves.In  the  multilingual  setting,  machine  translationfeasibility,  its  presuppositions and implications,brings forth a range of questions, applicable tohuman translation as well, including, but not lim-ited to, linguistic and ontological relativity, inde-terminacy of translation,  inscrutability of  refer-ence,  representational  function of language,  theproblem of meaning.Bar  Hillel?s  claims  on  the  infeasibility  of  ma-chine translation and the Sapir-Whorf hypothesiswith  the  linguistic  determinism  and  relativityprinciples, partly backed up by Quine?s ontologi-cal relativity and later Wittgenstein?s private lan-guage  and  variability  of  language  games  havehaunted the way of thinking in machine transla-tion development.
Indeterminacy,  relativity, andthe consequent abolition of the one gold transla-tion idea, however, as well as the necessity forframeworks  integrating  pragmatic  and  be-havioural  data  in  translation  have  played  theirrole  in  advancing  machine  translation  designpaving the way for observed paradigm shifts atall stages of development.In broadly dividing machine translation historyin the rule-based and corpus-based eras,  in  the50?s  and  80?s  respectively,  one  can  draw  theanalogies that would rather point to a tight inter-action between philosophical  accounts and ma-chine translation paradigms.Early contemporary analytic philosophy, throughconceptual,  reference-bound  analysis  and  com-positionality principles, provided the foundationfor  representational,  rule  and  knowledge-basedapproaches  of  early  machine  translation,  from50?s through the 80?s.
The turn, in analytic phi-losophy, to an understanding of meaning thoughuse,  to  pragmatics  and  behaviourism,  may  bepaired and seen as laying the foundation for themachine  translation paradigm shift  observed inthe 80?s.
In this pairing, it is the use of the muchrequired parallel (or comparable) translation datathat could be seen as constituting the behaviouraldata  base,  with  each  alignment  function  beingconceived of as the result of a radical translationprocess, where a source language sentence pro-vides the sensory data and a target language sen-tence provides the linguistic observation.
In sucha framework, this aligned data source does pro-vide the ?translation manual?, which after a se-ries of  inductive operations does converge to apotentially usable set of translation relations.Along this line, we will discuss, in this talk, thecontinuous  relations  between  analytic  philoso-phy, linguistic science and human language tech-nologies.
Such relations, direct or indirect, can bebi-directional and can possibly work towards bet-ter understanding and facilitating the virtuous cy-cle between language technology and its theoreti-cal underpinnings.1
