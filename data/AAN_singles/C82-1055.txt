Academia, 1982LEXICAL  PARALLEL ISM IN TEXT STRUCTURE DETERMINATIONAND CONTENT ANALYS ISYosh iyuk i  SakamotoE lec t ro techn ica l  LaboratoryTsukuba,  JapanTetsuya  OkamotoUnivers i ty  of  E lec t rocommunicat ionsTokyo,  JapanABSTRACTIn this paper the problem is discussed about the textstructure determination and content analysis by lexicalparall~lism, or  the repetition of lexical items.Intersentential relations are determined through theidentical, partly identical or lexico-semantic repetition inJapanese scientific texts.
Lexical parallelism ratio andlexical parallelism indicator distance are obtained oncomputer and by hand.
And the application of thecharacteristics to automatic content analysis is dicsussed.I.
INTRODUCTIONLexical parallelism, that is, therepetition of lexical items, is animportant device for indicating thesentence connections in atext(discouse).
The recurrent lexicalitems, or lexical equivalents need nothave the same syntactic function orparts of speech in the two sentencesin which they occur.
They may beidentical in form and in meaning, orthey may be related by lexico-semanticrelationship, such as synonymy,hyponymy, antonymy.
In a special casethey may be partly identical both inform and in meaning, as in ~(ultrasonic wave), ~(sound wave)and ~ (sound).Another device for indicating thesentence connections is a syntacticdevice, such as substitutes, logicalconnecters, time and place relatersand structural parallelism \[I\].
Forexample, in Japanese substitutes---~/  C~ (this), ~_.__~__~ (here),~ (we/our), ~_____~ (it), timerelaters--- ~ (next), ~ (abovementioned), and logical connecters---~ (and), ~ (or ) ,  m--~(secondly) belong to th is  device.Sevbo studied lex lca l  paral le l ismin normalized text, where substituteswere replaced by their lexicalequivalents and complex sentences weredecomposed into successive simplesentences(clauses).She traced the repetition patternsof lexical items in Subject/Predicateoppossitio n. She assumes here thatthe syntactic subject or itsdependent, direct or indirect,corresponds to "Subject(oldinformation) of elementary thought"and the syntactic predicate or itsdependent to "Predicate(newinformation) of elementarythought"J2\].In Japanese, sentence componentsoccur in any positions beforepredicate and old information or topicis placed, as a rule, at/near thebeginning of a sentence\[3\].
In thefollowing discussion we analyze therepetition of lexical items in anunnormalized text without regard totheir syntactic functions, parts ofspeech and topic/comment distinctions,assuming that the lexical equivalentsat/near the beginning of the sentencesfunction as the keywords in indicatingthe sentence connections and thecontents of a text.Nouns do not inflect and most verbsand adjectives have the unchangingstems and inflectional suffixes inJapanese.
The important concepts andtechnical terms (noun, verb or339340 Y. SAKAMOTO and T. OKAMOTOadjective stems) are written in Kanji(Chinese ideographs) orKatakana(square Japanese syllabary).Katakana is used to transcribe foreigntechnical terms.
Hiragana(Japanesecursive syllabary), on the other hand,is used to write post-positionalparticles and suffixes, denoting case,topic, mood, tense aspect etc.
Inview of these facts we define lexicalitems as a word or phrase in Kanji andKatakana.We have studied lexicalparallelisms in a short tale\[4\], intechnical and scientific texts\[5,6\],based upon Sevbo's approach.
Thepurpose of the present paper is toobtain the characteristics of lexicalparallelism in Japanese technical andscientific texts and to explore thepossibilities of utilizing thesecharacteristics for automatic contentanalysis.Five text samples are used forexperiment and discussion.
They arethe essays on " Ultrasonicamplification"(Text A), "Brain andautomaton"(Text B), "Petrochemicalindustry"(Text C), "Chemical industryin Japan"(Text D) and "Betweenorganism and inanimate matter"(TextE).2.
LEXICAL PARALLELISM RATIOis t~e determinable maximum number ofthe ~entence connections in a text, Nbeing the total number of thesentences in the text: t is type oflexical repetition and w is theposition, i.e.
the sequence numberfrom the beginning of the sentence.The experiments were carried out toobtain the characteristics of thelexical parallelism in sample texts oncomputer and by hand.In eomputer experiment lexiealitems, i.e.
the sequence in Kanji orKatakana, were identified andsegmented by machine character codeswithout syntactic and morphologicalanalysis.
Then the sentenceconnections of type 1(identicalrepetition) are determined in eachpos i t ion  and lexical parallelismratios are obtained(Table I).
On thesame samples the optimal sentenceconnections are determined manuallyand the lexical parallelism ratioswere calculated(Table 2).
Except forText E, the totals of the ratiosamount to 72-83%(cf.
Table 2) and incomputer experiment the ratios of typeI in the initial position amount to57-68%(0f.
Table I).
And moreover,the initial lexieal items(w=1) showthe maxima in most samples in Table Iand by far the highest value in allsamples in Table 2, and they decreasewith increasing w in Table 2.
It isThe sentence connection of type t clear from the results that lexicalin position w is determined between parallelism plays an important role inthe given j-th sentence Sj and the the intersentential dependency andi-th sentence Si( i < j ), if and only lexical items at the beginning of theif Si is the nearest preceding sentences are the most relevantsentence which contains the lexical lexical parallelism indicators.item, lexically equivalent to the w-thlexical item from the beginning of the 3.

Lexical parallelism indicatorLexical parallelism ratio of type t distance is defined as follows:in position w is defined as follows: tt D : j - i= ( n / N - 1 ) * I00 w,jwwhere n is the number of the where D is lexical parallelismdetermined connections in a text: N-I indicator distance: t is type off ?LEXICAL PARALLELISM IN TEXT STRUCTURE DETERMINATION 341lexical repetition: w is position ofthe lexical indicator: i and j aresequence numbers of the governorsentence and dependent sentencerespectively.The distance is supposed torepresent the semantic extent of thelexical parallelism indicators, orbetter the concepts referred by them.In Figure I a diagonal unitdistance line indicates thehypothetical situation, where everysentence depends on the immediatelypreceding sentence.
Data show atendency to distribute near this linein all samples.Lexical parallelism indicators showthe progress of the author's thoughtin the text in Table 3.
Sevbo pointedout the significance of the indicatorswith large D in indicating thecontents of paragraphs and texts.
Thelexical items with large D aresupposed to be the important topics,to which the author of the textreturnes after commenting on anothertopics.
In the example the items withlarge D(D>IO) were shown in Figure 2.These indicators are distributedamong paragraphs.
For example, theindicator ~i~(u l t rasonic  wave)extends over 15 sentences(from 9th to24th) within paragraph 2, which rangesfrom 2nd to 4Oth sentence, and theindicator ~ (traveling-wavetube) extends over 22sentences(100th-122nd) withinparagraph 4(85th-123rd) as well.
Theindicator ~ m  (traveling-waveamplification) covers paragraph 3completely, ranging from the 41thsentence, or the first sentence of theparagraph, through the 67th sentenceto 85th sentence, or the firstsentence of the next paragraph.
Inshort, these indicators divide thetext into the three paragraphs.In addition, they reflectappropriately the contents ofparagraphs in the sample text, assuggested by the fact that they arepartly identical with the followingparagraph names:"Introduction"(paragraph I), "What isthe ultrasonic wave?
"(paragraph 2),"Microwave and traveling-wavetube"(paragraph 3) and "Ultrasonicwave and traveling-waveamplification"(paragraph 4).These data suggest that theindicator with large D may be usefulas keywords to the contents of atext.4.
CONCLUSIONLexlcal parallelism plays animportant role in the intersententialdependency, or text Structure andlexieal items at the beginning of thesentences are the most relevantlexical parallelism indicators.The initial lexical parallelismindicators with long lexicalparallelism indicator distancesreflect the contents of paragraphs andmay be useful keywords in informationretrieval.The partly identical repetition andlexico-semantic repetition through thelexical items at/near the beginning ofthe sentence,firstly, intersententialdependency by syntactic device,secondly, the recognition oftopic/comment opposition in thesentence, thirdly, and lastly, theapplication to automatic keyword orkey-sentence extraction in contentanalysis depend on the futureresearches.REFERENCE\[i\] Quirk, R., Greenbaum, S., Leech,G., and Svartvik, J., A grammar ofcontemorary English (Longman, London,1972).\[2\] Sevbo, I.N., Struktura svjaznovoteksta i avtomatizatsija (Nayka, M.,1969).\[3\] Maklno, S., Grammar of repetition(Taisyukan, Tokyo, 1980).\[4\] Okamoto, T., Text structuredetermination and content analysis bylexical parallelism, Proceeding of theUniv.
