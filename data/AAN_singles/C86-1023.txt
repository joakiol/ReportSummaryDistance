Idiosyncratic Gap: A Tough Prolem to Structure-boundMachine TranslationYoshihiko NitreAdvanced Research LaboratoryHitachi Ltd.Kokubunji, Tokyo 185 JapanABSTRACTCurrent practical machine translation systems (MT,in shor t ) ,  which are  des igned  to  dea l  w i th  a hugeamount  o f  document ,  a re  genera l \ ]y  s t ruc ture -bound.That  i s ,  the  t rans la t ion  process  i s  done  based  on t i leanalysis and transformation of the structure ofsource sentence, not on the understanding and para-phrasing of the meaning of that.
But each languagehas its own :~yntactic and semantic idiosyncrasy, andon this account, without understanding the total mean-ing of source sentences it is often difficult for MTto bridge properly the idiosyncratic gap betweensource~ and target- language.
A somewhat new methodcalled "Cross Translation Test (CTT, in short)" ispresented that reveals the detail of idiosyncraticgap (IG, in short) together with the so-so satis-fiable possibility of MT.
It is also mentioned theusefulness olf sublanguage approach to reducing the ICbetween source- and target- language.i.
Introduct:ionThe majoJ:\[ty of the current practical machinetranslation system (MT, in short) (See \[Nagao 1985\]and \[Slocum 11.985\] for a good survey.)
are structure-bound in tile sense that al\] the target sentences (i.e.translated ,~entences) are composed only from thesyntactic st:ructure of the source sentences, not fromthe meaning understanding of those.
Though almostall tile MT are utilizing some semantic devices suchas semantic feature agreement checkers, semanticfilters antl preference semantics (See \[Wilks 1975\]for example.)
which are serving as syntactic structur-al disambiguation, they still remain Jn structure-hound approaches far from tile total\[ meaning under-standing approaches.\]?he structure-bound MT has a lot of advantageousfeatures among which the easiness of formalizingtranslation process, that is, writing translationrules and the uniformity of lexicon description arevital from the practical standpoint that it musttransact a huge vocabulary and \]numerable kinds ofsentence patterns.On the other hand, the structure-bound MT has theinewttable limitation on the treatment of lingu:isticidiosyncrasy originated from the different way of"thinking.In this paper, first of all, we will sketch outthe typical language modeling techniques on which thestructure-bound MT(= current practical machinetranslation systems) are constructed.
Secondly, wewill examine the difference between the principalmechanism of machine translation and that of humantranslation irom the viewpoint of the language under-standing abi\]ity, l'hirdly, we will illustrate thestructural idiosyncratic gap (IG, in short) by com-paring the sample sentences in English and that in,lapanese.
These sentences are sharing the same reCall-ing.
This comparison will be made by a somewhat newmethod which we call "Cross Translation Test (CTT, inshort)", which will cventual\]y reveal the various IGsthat have origins in the differences of culture, i.e.,the way of thinking or the way of representing con-cepts.
But at" the same Lime, CTT wiJl give someencouraging evidence that the principal technologiesof today's not-yet-completed structure-bound HTs havethe potentia\] for producing barely acceptable trans-lation, if the source language sentences are takenfrom tile documents of less equivocations or are ap-propriately rewritten.
Finally, we will brieflycomment on the sub\]anguage to control or normalizesource sentences as the promising and practical ap-proaches to overcoming the IGs.2.
Modelin~ of Natural Lan~Modeling natural, language sentences is, needlessto say, very essential to all kinds of naturallanguage processing systems inclusive of machinetranslation systems.
The aim of mode\]ing :is toreduce the superficia\] complexity and variety of thesentence form, so as to reveal the indwell:Lug struc-ture which is indispensable for computer systems toanalyze, to transform or to generate sententia\].representations.So far various modeling techniques are proposed(See for example \[Winograd 1.983\].)
among which thetwo, tile dependency structure modeling (Figure l) andthe phrase structure modeling (Figure 2) are impor-tant.
The former associated with semantic colelabeling such as case marker assignment is indispen-sable to analyze and generate Japanese sentencestrueture (See for example \]Nit,a, et al.
1984\].
),and the latter associated with syntactic rote label-ing such as governor-dependent assignment, head-com-plement assignment, or mother-daughter assignment(See for example \[Nitta, et el.
1982\].)
is essentialto analyze and generate English sentences.Kono kusuri-wa itsft.rli sugu(thisj \[medicine\] \[on stonmchache} \[immediately I\[Lit.

"To what extent should (or can) we treat semanticsof sentences?"
is also very crucial to the decisionfor selecting nr designing tile linguistic model for107machine translation.
But it might be fairly assertedthat the majority of the current "practical" machinetranslation systems (MT, in short)are structure-boundor syntax-oriented, though almost all of them claimthat they are semantics-directed.
Semantics are usedonly for disambiguation and booster in varioussyntactic processes, but not used for the centralengine for transformation, generation and of coursenot for paragraph understanding (See \[Slocum 1985,pp.
14 ~16\] for a good survey and discussion on thisproblem; and see also \[Nitta, et al 1982\] for thediscussion on a typical (classical) structure-boundtranslation mechanism,i.e, local rearrangementmethod).
Here "practical" means "of very large scalecommercial systems" or "of the daily usage by openusers", but neither "of small scale laboratory sys-tems" nor "of the theory-oriented experimental sys-tems".
For structure-bound machine translationsystems, both the dependency structure modeling andthe phrase structure modeling are very fundamentaltechnical tools.

Example of Phrase Structure ModelingThe semantic network medeling, which is recentlyregarded as an essential tool for semantic process-ing for natural languages (See for examples\[SimmOns 1984\].
), might also be viewed as a variationof dependency modeling.
However modeling problemsare not discussed further here.
Comparing Figure 1and Figure 2, note that the dependency structuremodeling is more semantics-oriented, logical andabstract, in the sense of having some distance fromsurface word sequences.3.
Machine Translation vs. lluman TranslationToday's practical machine translation systems (MT,in short) (See for example \[Nagao 1985\] and \[Slocum1985\].)
are essentially structure-bound \]iteral type.The reasons for this somewhat extreme judgement areas follows:(i) The process of MT is always under the strongcontrol of the structural information extractedfrom source sentences;(2) In all the target sentences produced by MT, wecan easily detect the traces of wording andphrasing of the source sentences;(3) MT is quite indifferent to whether or not theoutput translation is preserving the propermeaning of the original sentence, and what isworse, MT is incapable of judging whether ornot;(4) MT is quite poor at the extra-sentential infor-mation such as situational information, worldknowledge and common sense which give a verypowerful command of language comprehension.Now let us see Figure 3.
This rather over-simplified figure illustrates the typical process ofJapanese-English structure-bound machine translation.Here the analysis and transformation phase are basedon the dependency structure modeling (cf.
Figure i)and the generation phase is based on the phrasestructure modeling (cf.
Figure 2) (For furtherdetails, see for example \[Nitta, et al 1984\].
).This figure reveals that all the process is bound bythe grammatical structure of the source sentence,but not by the meaning of that.Source Sentence:Kono kusuri-wa itsu-ni sugu kiku.

Simplified Sketch of Machine Translation ProcessThus, the MT can easily perform the literalsyntax-directed translation such as 'from (Jl) into(E'I)' (cf.
Figure i).
But it is very very dif-ficult for MT to produce natural translation whichreflects the idiosyncrasy of target language) pre--serving the original meaning.
(El) is an example ofa natural translation of (J1).
In order for MT toproduce this (El) from (Jl), it may have to invokea somewhat sophisticated heuristic rule.
In Figure3, the heuristic rule, HR (KK, KS, ...), can sucess-fully indicate the change of predicate which mayimprove the treatment for the idiosyncrasy of targetsentence.But generally.
, the treatment of idiosyncratic gap(IG, in short) such as 'that between (Jl) and (El)'108is very difficult for MT.
It might '  be almost im-possible to find universal grarmnatical rules tomanipulate this kind of gaps, .and what is worse,the appropriake heuristic rules are not alwaysfound successfully.On the other hand, tile human translation (HT, inshort) is essentially semantics-oriented type ormeaning understanding type.
3?he reasons for thisjudgement are as follows:(i) HT is free from the structure, wording andphrasing of a source sentence;(2) liT can "create" (rather than "translate") freelya target sentence from something like an image(Hagram obtained froln a source sentence (F~gure4); (Of course the exact structnre of th\].q imagediagram is not yet known);(3) }IT often refers tile extra-linguistic knowledgef~uch as the  common sense  and the  cu l tu re ;(4) Thus,  tIT cart overcome the  id iosyncrat : i c  gaps(\]G) f ree ly  and unconsc ious ly .Source Sentence(s) .

The reason  fo r  compar ing  ti le two sen-tences  i s  that  we cannot: examine  the  l ingu is t i cidiosyncrasy itself.
Because, currently, we cannotfix the one abstract neutral meaning withoutusing something like the image diagram (cf.

The outline ofCTT is as follows:\]first, take an appropriate well-written samplesentence written in one language, say English; LetE denote this sample sentence; Secondly, select ormake the proper free translation of E in the other\].anguage, say Japanese; \],et J denote this properfree translation; J must preserve tile orlginal mean-ing of E properly; At the same time, make a literalLrans\].tion of F, in the same language that ,\] iswritten in; Let J' denote this literal translation;Lastly, make a Literal translation of J in the samelanguage.that E is written in; Let E' denote tM.sliteral translation.iIere, the "literal" translation means the transla-tion that :\[.s preserving the wording, phras:ing andvarious senteatial structure of the original (source)sentence  as much as poss ib le .

J - -IG: Idiosyncratic GapI , T :  Literal TranslationFT: Free TranslationE, E': Sentences Written m EnglishJ, J': Sentences Written in JapaneseIs this paper, we have assumed that:I,T '= MT and I:T ~ HT,where, MT: Machine Translation, and lfi': Human Translation.Fiyure 5.
Illustrative Definitioil of Idiosyncratic GapNow, note  that  we (:all assume the  re \ ]a t Jonsh i l )  ,i,'\]\] e= MT,a n d\]\]'T -& \]HT,where "-" " denoLes "near\]y equal" or "be a\].most equiv-alent to".
Namely, we can assume that the \]itera\]LranslatJon, ILl', which i.s preserving the wording,phrasing and structure of tile source sentence, Jsalmost e-qu:\[va\].ent to the idealized competence oftoday's practical structure-bonnd machine trans\]ation,MT.
Tim rationale of this assumption has already beendiscussed in Section 3.?n this section, let us examine the idiosyncraticgaps between the two sentences which share the sameIn this paper, the litera\] trans\]ation, \],T (" MT),is performed by tracing the \[)roeedural steps of avirtual machine translation system (VMTS) theoretical-ly.
\]1ere, the VMTS is a certain hypothetical system109which never models itself upon any actually existingmachine translation systems, but which models thegeneral properties of today's practical structure-bound machine translation systems.Now let us observe the gap, IG, by applying CTT tovarious sample sentences.
First, let us take anexample with large gaps.Kokkyo-no nagal tonnent-wo nuken~-to yuki-guni de-atta.\[of borderl \[Iongl \[ tunnell (after passing throughl \[snow countryl Iwasl?
\[Lit.
After passing through the long border runnel, it was the snow country.\] +(E'3)?
Tile train came out of the long tunnel into the snow country.
(E3)Ressha-wa nagal tonnenl-wo fluke-re ytlki-guni-ni de-ta.
(J3) is taken from the very famous novel "Yuki-guni" written by Yasunari Kawabata, and (E3) is takenfrom the also famous translation by Seidensticker.
(E'3) :is the slight modification of \[Nakamura 1973,p.27\] and (J'3) is taken from the same hook.
In (E3)the new word "the train \[ressha\]" is supplemented ac-cording to the situational understanding of the para-graph including (J3) which may, currently, be possibleonly for HT.
(J3) is a very typical Japanese sentence possessingthe interesting idiosyncrasy, i.e., (J3) has no super-ficial subject.
But in (J3) some definite subject issurely recognized, though unwritten.
That is "theeyes of the storyteller", or rather "the eyes of thereader who has already joined the travel to the snowcountry by the train".
So the actual meaning of (J3)can be explained as follows:After I (= the reader who is now experiencing theimaginary travel) passed through the long bordertunnel by the train, it was the snow countrytha~ I encountered.Thus (J3) is very successful in recalling thefresh and vivid impression of seeing (also feeling andsmelling) suddenly the snow country to the readers.
(J3) has a poetic feeling and a lyric appeal in itsneat and concise style.But the English sentence such as (E3) requires theconcrete, clearly written subject, "the train \[ = res-sha\]" in this case, and this concrete subject requiresthe verb, "came", and again this verb requires the twolocative adverbial phrases, "out of the long tunnel"and "into the snow country".
Thus, the originalphrase "yuki-guni de-atta.
\[ = it was the snowcountry.\]" in (J3) has completely disappeared in(E3), but the new adverbial phrase "into the snowcountry \[=yuki-guni-ni\]" appears instead.
Thesedrastic changes are made under the strong influenceof linguistic idiosyncrasy, and, at the same time,with the effort to preserve the original poeticmeaning as much as possible.Consequently, these changes have invoked a largedistant gap, IG between (J3) and (E3).
But this gapis indispensable for this translation from (J3) into(E3),HT:  (J3) ?
(E3)  ,where, \](J3) - (E3) I ~ l( E 3) - (E3) I ~ ~G =large.One more comment.
Note that as a result of thislarge gap, the literal translation from (J3) into(E'3),LT: (J3) ?
(E'3)where, J(J3) - (E'3)J~J(E'3) - (E'3) I = 0has failed to preserve the original meaning, i.e.,(E'3) is an unacceptable translation which ismisleading.
Because (E'3) can be interpreted as:After something (=it) finished passing throughthe long border tunnel, something became(= changed into) the snow country.However, it is not always the case with idio-syncratic gaps.
Lastly, let us now observe thesomewhat encouraging example favorable for struc-ture-bound machine translation, MT ("-LT).
In thefollowing quadruplet, the gap is not so small butthe gapless translation, i.e~, LT ( 'MT) is accept-able.
The following sample sentence (E4), is thenews line taken from \[Newsweek, January 18, 1982,p.45\].?

For tilereason of space limitation we have omitted thecomments to this example.Let us see one more example sentence (iS) inorder to confirm that the structure-bound MT, whichlacks the ability to understand the meaning of sourcesentences, can produce the barely passable trans-lation, and to try to search for the reason for this.
(as)1~o } 0'5) milaIsaw\[(E5) is one of the sample sentences in \[Wilks1975\] where anaphora and references are discussed asthe important elements of sentence understanding.As is pointed out by Wilks, a certain extent ofunderstanding is necessary to solve the anaphora andreference problem of the sentence (E5), that is,whether "them" refers "the soldiers" or "the women".And actually, the structure-bound MT, which cannotunderstand the meaning of "fired.at" and "fall",may translate "them" into "kare-ra" being indiffer-110cut tO tile anaphora and references.
?in Japanese"kare-ra" denot:es the pronoun of \]male, third person,plural\], and "kanojo-ra" denotes tile pronoun of\[female, third person, plural\], so (,7'5) \].s somewhatmisleading translation.
Nevertheless, human (i.e.almost all thc~ Japanese readers) can sure\].y under-stand the sentence (J'5) correctly; that is, theycan understand that "kare-ra" (="them") is referring"on-na-tachi" (= "the women") uot "heishi-tachi"(="the  soldie-rs").
The reason of this is that thehuman's brain can understand lille ,leaning of thesentence (J'5) with the support of the colmnon senselike :X fires at Y + Y will severly wounded+ Y will fall and die,which functions as the compensator for the anaphoraand references.The above example shows that the lack of theanaphoric ability in structure-bound MT may sometimesbe compensated by the human-side, which is the en-couraging fact for MT.So far the point we are trying to make clear isthat even IG-neglecting MT (= structure-bomld machinetranslation systems) can generate target sentencesthat convey the correct meaning of source sentences,when tlre \].att:er are written J.n simple, logical, struc-tures.5.
ConclusionsThis paper has dealt with the \].imitations andpotentials of structure-bound machine translation(MT) from the standpoint of the idiosyncratic gaps(IG) that exist between Japanese and \]';nglish.

This was po in ted  out by app ly ing  theCross Translation Test (CTT) to several samplesentences, which brought the performance limitationsof structure-bound mach:i.ne translation into sharprelief.
But the CTT applications also showed that ifthe source language sentence Js simple, logical andcontains few ambiguities, today's fG-neglectJngmachine translation systems are capable of generatingacceptable target sentences, sentences that preservethe meaning of the original (source) sentences atrdcan be understood.However ~ source sentences are not always simple,logical and unambiguous.
Therefore, to improve theperformance of machine trans\]ation systems it will benecessary to develop technology and techniques aimedat rewriting .
';ource sentences prior to inputting theminto systems, and at formalizing (norma\]izing) andcontrol.ling source sentence preparation.
One move inthis direction in recent years has had to do with tilesource language itself.
Research has been steadilyadvancing in the area of Sub\].anguage Theory.
Sub-languages are more regulated and controlled thaneveryday humml languages, and therefore make it easierto create simple, logical sentences that are re\].ative-ly free of ambiguities.
Some examples of sublanguagetheories currently under study are "sublanguage"\[Kittredge and Lehrberger 1982\]~"controlled language"\[Nagao \].98311 and "normalized language" \[Yoshida\]984\].The aim of these sublanguage theories is to assigncertain rules arld restrict:lens to \]:he everyday human\]anguagea we use to trausmXt and explain information,improving the accuracy of parsing operations necessary\]for nlachJ.ne processJ.ng~ aud enhancing human under-standing.
Some examples of the \].ingnJstic rules andrestrictions envisioned by the sublanguage theoriesare rules governing the creation of lexicons\[Kigtredge and Lehrberger 1982\], rules governingthe use of function words related to the log:tca\]const ruct ion  of sentences  \[Yoshida 1984\] and ru \ ]esgovernirlg the expression of son\]cut\]el dependencies\[Nagao 1.983\] .ReferencesEikyo \[Nihon-Eigo-Ky~Jku-Ky$kai\] (eds.)
