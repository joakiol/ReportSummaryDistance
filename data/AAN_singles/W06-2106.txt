Theseprepositions, among the most common wordsin English, contain 211 senses.
By analyzingthe coverage of these senses, it is shown thatTPP provides potentially greater breadth anddepth than other inventories of the range ofsemantic roles.
Specific inheritancemechanisms are developed within thepreposition sense inventory and shown to beviable and provide a basis for therationalization of the range of prepositionmeaning.
In addition, this rationalization canbe used for developing a data-driven mappingof a semantic role hierarchy.
Based on thesefindings and methodology, the broadstructure of a WordNet-like representation ofpreposition meaning, with self-containeddisambiguation tests, is outlined.1 IntroductionThe Preposition Project (TPP, Litkowski &Hargraves, 2005)1provides a large amount of datafor a small number of prepositions.
To date, 13 outof 373 prepositions (among the most frequent inEnglish) have been analyzed.
We examined the datafor these prepositions to determine (1) theircoverage of the semantic space of semanticrelations, (2) the extent to which these data could beextrapolated to prepositions not yet covered, and (3)what types of analyses might be useful to fillshortcomings in the data.
Examining these issuesseems important to determining the extent to whichthe data in the project can be used in NLPapplications.TPP is designed to provide a comprehensivedatabase of preposition senses, so it is useful toprovide a mechanism for assessing the extent ofcoverage, not only in comparison with the range ofmeanings described in traditional grammar, but alsoin comparison with analyses within thecomputational linguistics community.
Similarly, itseems important to determine how, if at all, the datadeveloped thus far can be leveraged for use withother preposition meanings not yet analyzed, e.g.,through mechanisms of inheritance.
Finally, throughthese analyses, it is useful to identify anyshortcomings in data being developed in TPP andwhat further should be undertaken.In the following sections, we first provide anoverview of TPP and extensions to its availabledata that have occurred since its inception.
Next, weexamine issues of coverage in relation to the rangeof preposition meaning contained in Quirk et al(1985), alongside the ranges in other resources suchas the Penn Treebank, FrameNet, and LexicalConceptual Structures.
This analysis also considersaccounts of semantic relations that have beenpresented in literature that has used these otherresources.
Next, we critically examine claims of theinheritance of preposition meaning as described inLitkowski (2002), including consideration ofinheritance mechanisms in FrameNet.
This analysissuggests some mechanisms for a data-driven orcorpus-based approach to the identification of asemantic relation inventory.
Finally, based on theseanalyses of coverage and inheritance, we identifysome next steps TPP needs to take.2 The Preposition ProjectThe primary objective of TPP is to characterizeeach of 847 preposition senses for 373 prepositions(including 220 phrasal prepositions with 309senses) with a semantic role name and the syntacticand semantic properties of its complement andattachment point.
The preposition sense inventoryis taken from the Oxford Dictionary of English1http://www.clres.com/prepositions.html.37(2004).2Starting from the senses for a particularpreposition, a set of instances of that prepositionare extracted from the FrameNet database.
Alexicographer then assigns a sense from theinventory to each instance.
While engaged in thissense assignment, the lexicographer accumulates anunderstanding of the behavior of the preposition,assigns a name to each sense (characterizing itssemantic type), and characterizes the syntactic andsemantic properties of the preposition complementand its point of attachment or head.
Each sense isalso characterized by its syntactic function and itsmeaning, identifying the relevant paragraph(s)where it is discussed in Quirk et alTPP then makes available the sense analysis(including the lexicographer?s overview) and the setof instances for each preposition that is analyzed.
Inaddition, the disambiguated instances are thenanalyzed to provide the set of FrameNet frames andframe elements associated with each sense.
The setof sentences is provided in Senseval format, alongwith an answer key, for use in development ofpreposition disambiguation routines (ranging from300 to over 4000 sentences for ?of?).
Finally, usingthe FrameNet frame and frame element of thetagged instances, syntactic alternation patterns(other syntactic forms in which the semantic rolemay be realized) are provided for each FrameNettarget word; this data constitutes a suitable corpusfor use in studying, for example, English verbclasses (see Levin, 1993).An important next step for TPP is the use ofthese disambiguated instances to refine thecharacterization of the syntactic and semanticproperties of the complement and the point ofattachment.
As the lexicographer has analyzed thesense inventory for a preposition, the question of itsuse in relation to other words is continually raised.In particular, the question is whether a sense standsalone or is selected for by a verb or other word(most frequently, an adjective).3The lexicographerhas observed that selection might be occurring.
Theextent to which this occurs will be examined whenan attempt is made, for example, to developdecision lists for disambiguating among apreposition?s senses.4We hope, as a result, that thenumber of instances available for disambiguationwill permit a more definitive characterization ofselection.Since Litkowski & Hargraves (2005), severaladditions have been made to the data and analysesavailable under TPP.
First, Oxford University Presshas granted permission to provide the definitionsand examples of the senses for each definition fromthe Oxford Dictionary of English (ODE, 2003)(and its predecessor, the New Oxford Dictionary ofEnglish (NODE, 1997)).
Second, a summary file ofall senses has been prepared from the individualpreposition sense analyses, facilitating overviewanalysis of the full sense inventory (e.g., sorting thetable on different columns).
Third, thelexicographer has disambiguated the endingpreposition of definitions as those prepositions areanalyzed (e.g., in sense 1 of about, on the subjectof, identifying the applicable sense of of); 451prepositions have been so tagged.At present, the following 13 prepositions havebeen analyzed (with the initial number of senses inparentheses): about (6), against (10), at (12), by(22), for (14), from (14), in (11), of (18), on (23),over (16), through (13), to (17), and with (16).The number of senses has changed based onchanges from NODE to ODE and based onevidence developed in the project (adding 19 sensesthat are attested with the FrameNet data).
Theseprepositions include the most frequent in English(see Boonthum et al, 2006 for the top 10 based onthe Brown corpus).
In summary, the 13 prepositions(out of 373 identified in Litkowski, 2002) have 210senses (19 have been added during the course ofTPP) out of the original 847 senses.It is noteworthy also that in moving fromNODE to ODE, 60 prepositions have beenremoved.
Some of these prepositions are variantspellings (e.g.
abaht for about).
Most are phrasalprepositions, e.g., to the accompaniment of.
In2TPP does not include particle senses of such wordsas in or over (or any other particles) used with verbsto make phrasal verbs.
In this context, phrasal verbsare to be distinguished from verbs that select apreposition (such as on in rely on), which may becharacterized as a collocation.
We are grateful to ananonymous reviewer for raising this issue.3We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for thischaracterization.4The anonymous reviewer asked whether TPPexcludes senses that are selected for.
This promptedan examination of whether this might be the case.Although it is the intent that such senses be included,an examination of how FrameNet instances aregenerated raises the possibility that such instancesmay have excluded.
Procedures are currently beingdeveloped to ensure that such instances are notexcluded.38NODE, the definitions constitute a lexicographicstatement that the meaning of the phrase has anidiomatic status, i.e., is not solely recoverable basedon an understanding of the meanings of itsconstituents.
In ODE, such phrases are identified ashaving collocative status and thereby rendered inexample usages with italics, but not given adefinition.
Such phrases will be retained in TPP.Litkowski & Hargraves (2005) provides moredetails on the methodology used in TPP and thedatabases that are available.3 Semantic Coverage of TPPAlthough only a small percentage of theprepositions have as yet been analyzed,approximately 25 percent of the total number ofsenses are included in the 13 prepositions.
Thispercentage is sufficient to assess their coverage ofthe semantic space of prepositional meaning.3.1 Assessing the Broad Spectrum of SemanticSpaceTo assess the coverage, the first question is whatinventory should be used.
The linguistics andcomputational linguistics literatures are replete withintrospective lists of semantic roles.
Gildea &Jurafsky (2002) present a list of 18 that may beviewed as reasonably well-accepted.
O?Hara (2005)provides several compilations based on PennTreebank annotations, FrameNet, OpenCyc, andFactotum.
Boonthum et al (2006) includes anassessment of semantic roles in Jackendoff, Dorr?sLexical Conceptual Structures prepositiondatabase, and Barker?s analysis of prepositionmeaning; she posits a list of 7 overarching semanticroles (although specifically intended for use inparaphrase analysis).
Without going into a detailedanalysis of each of these lists, all of which arerelatively small in number, the semantic relationsincluded in TPP clearly cover each of the lists.However, since the semantic relations in these listsare relatively coarse-grained, this assessment is notsufficient.Quirk et al (1985) is arguably the mostcomprehensive introspective compilation of therange of preposition meaning.
As indicated above,in analyzing the senses for a preposition, thelexicographer includes a reference to a section inQuirk et al(specifically in Chapter 9).
Quirk et aldescribe the meanings of prepositions in 50sections, with the majority of discussion devoted tospatial and temporal prepositions.
By comparingthe references in the spreadsheets for eachpreposition (i.e., a data-driven approach), we findthat only 4 sections are not yet mentioned.
Theseare 9.21 (between), 9.56 (concession), 9.58(exception and addition), and 9.59 (negativecondition).
In general, then, TPP broadly covers thefull range of meanings expressed by prepositions asdescribed in Quirk et al.However, for almost half of the senses analyzedin TPP (100 of 210), the lexicographer was unableto assign a Quirk paragraph in Chapter 9 orelsewhere.
This raises the question of whetherQuirk et al can be viewed as comprehensive.
Apreliminary examination of the semantic relationsassigned by the lexicographer and not assigned aQuirk paragraph indicates that the range ofprepositional meaning is more extensive than whatis provided in Quirk et alTwo major categories of missing semanticrelations emerge from this analysis.
Of the 100senses without a Quirk paragraph, 28 involveprepositional usages pertaining to quantities.
Theseinclude the semantic relations like Age (?at six hecontracted measles?, ScaleValue (?an increase of5%?
), RatioDenominator (?ten miles to thegallon?
), Exponent (?10 to the fourth power?
),ValueBasis (?a tax on tea?
), Price (?copies areavailable for $5"), and UnitSize (?billing is by theminute?).
Another 32 involve prepositions used toestablish a point of reference, similar to theStandard in Quirk (section 9.62), except indicatinga much broader set.
These include semanticrelations like FormerState (?wakened from adream?
), KnowledgeSource (?information frombooks?
), NameUsed (?call him by his last name?
),ParentName (?a child by her first husband?
),Experiencer (?a terrible time for us?
), andComparator (?that?s nothing compared to this?
).The remaining 40 semantic relations, such asMusicalKey (?in F minor?
), Drug (?on dope?
), andProfessionAspect (?a job in publishing?
), appear torepresent finer-grained points of prepositionalmeaning.This assessment of coverage suggests that TPPcurrently not only covers the broad range ofsemantic space, but also identifies gaps that havenot received adequate treatment in the linguisticliterature.
Perhaps such gaps may be viewed as?beneath the radar?
and not warranting elaboratetreatment.
However, it is highly likely that these39SemanticRelation Frequency Definitions ExamplesLocation 0.404 expressing location or arrival in aparticular place or positioncrouched at the edge of the trackTemporal 0.072 expressing the time when an eventtakes placeavoid confusiong at this late stageLevel 0.039 denoting a particular point or segmenton a scalecharged at two percentSkill 0.038 expressing a particular state orcondition, or a relationship between anindividual and a skillbrilliant at the jobActionObject 0.276 expressing the object of a look,gesture, thought, action, or planmoaned at himStimulus 0.171 expressing the means by whichsomething is done or the cause of anaction or reactionboiled at his lack of thoughtTable 1.

FrameNet Instances in The Preposition Projectsenses occur with considerable frequency andshould be treated.It is somewhat premature to perform acomprehensive analysis of coverage that provides afull characterization of the semantic space ofpreposition meaning based on the 25 percent ofsenses that have been analyzed thus far.
However,the available data are sufficient to begin such aneffort; this issue is further discussed below.3.2 Assessing Finer-Grained Spectra ofPrepositional MeaningWhile examining the broad coverage of prepositionmeaning, several issues affecting the treatment ofindividual prepositions in the computationallinguistics literature emerged.
These issues alsoprovide a perspective on the potential value of theanalyses being performed in TPP.O?Hara (2005), in attempting to create aframework for analysis and identification ofsemantic relations, examined the utility of PennTreebank II annotations and FrameNet frameelements.
He examined sentences containing at inboth corpora.
In Treebank, he noted that there werefour senses: locative (0.732), temporal (0.239),manner (0.020), and direction (0.006).
InFrameNet, with some combination of frameelements, he identified five major senses: addressee(0.315), other (0.092), phenomenon (0.086), goal(0.079), and content (0.051).Table 1 provides a coarse-grained analysis of atdeveloped in TPP (6 additional subsenses are notshown).
Although frequencies are shown in thetable, they should not be taken seriously, since theFrameNet instances on which they are based makesno claim to be representative.
In particular,FrameNet seldom annotates temporal referencessince they are usually viewed as peripheral frameelements that may occur with virtually all frames.Nonetheless, the frequencies in the FrameNetinstances does indicate that each of the at senses islikely to occur at levels that should not be ignoredor glossed over.In comparing TPP results with Penn Treebankcharacterizations, it seems that, not only might thecorpus be unrepresentative, but that the linguisticintrospection does not capture the more naturalarray of senses.
Thus, by combining corpusevidence (from FrameNet) with a lexicographicperspective for carving out sense distinctions, animproved balance results.
It should also be notedthat in Table 1, the final sense for Stimulusemerged from the FrameNet data and from Quirkand was not identified in the ODE sense inventory.Comparing TPP results with O?Hara?saggregation of FrameNet frame elements indicatesthe difficulty of working directly with the largenumber of frame elements (currently over 700).
AsGildea & Jurafsky noted, it is difficult to map theseframe elements into higher level semantic roles.Some assistance is available from the FrameNetinheritance hierarchy, but this is still not well-developed.
This issue is taken up further below indescribing how TPP?s data-driven approach mayfacilitate this kind of mapping.In summary, the methodology being followed inTPP arguably provides a more natural and a moreassuredly complete coverage of the fine-grainedsenses associated with an individual preposition.404 Inheritance Within the PrepositionSense InventoryThe preceding discussion provides some assurancethat TPP provides broad coverage of the range ofprepositional meaning and fine-grained analysis ofthe behavior of individual prepositions.
However,the large number of preposition senses requiressome additional work to manage these broad andfine-grained spectra.
Litkowski (2002) provided agraph-theoretical analysis that arrangedprepositions into a hierarchy.
However, thatanalysis treated individual prepositions asaggregations, i.e., all senses were combined intonodes in a digraph.
With the finer-grained analysisnow available in TPP data, a more in-depthexamination of inheritance within the prepositionsense inventory is possible.4.1 Initial Considerations for Mapping Out theInheritance HierarchyOf the 847 senses described in Litkowski (2002),and used as the starting point for the analysis inTPP, most follow the prototypical form of aprepositional phrase followed by a terminal(dangling) preposition, e.g., for sense 1 of about,on the subject of.
Litkowski viewed the terminalpreposition as a hypernym.
However, 62 senses donot have terminal prepositions (but rather usuallyverbs) and an additional 164 senses are usage notesdescribing behavior (such as the senses of at shownin Table 1).
These 226 senses were viewed as beingprimitive, while the remaining 621 were viewed asbeing derived in some way dependent on theputative hypernym.Among the 13 prepositions that have beenanalyzed thus far, 11 senses having a non-preposition hypernym and 100 senses with usagenotes have been characterized.
Thus, only abouthalf of the so-called primitives have been assigneda semantic relation type.
Further analysis of therange of meaning of these primitives should awaita more complete coverage of these senses.
The kindof analysis envisioned among these senses isdetermining how they group together and whatrange of semantic meaning they express.
This willbe discussed further below.Of the 621 senses with a preposition hypernym,411 end in one of the 13 prepositions that have beenanalyzed, with 175 ending in of and 74 in to.
Theremaining 210 senses end in prepositions with atmost a few cases of the same preposition.
Most ofthese remaining senses, in fact, are the ones thatgave rise to the definitional cycles and hierarchicalanalysis of the digraph described in Litkowski(2002).
As a result, senses with a prepositionhypernym form a set sufficient in size for a moredetailed analysis of inheritance within thepreposition inventory.4.2 The Meaning of an Inheritance Hierarchyfor PrepositionsThe assumption underlying an inheritance analysisof preposition definitions with a terminalpreposition is that such definitions are substitutablefor the preposition that is defined.
For example, ina book about ancient Greece, about can bereplaced by its definition to obtain a book on thesubject of ancient Greece.
This sense of about hasbeen labeled SubjectConsidered (or equivalently,Topic or Subject) by the lexicographer.
In theinheritance analysis, this definition of about is saidto have of as its hypernym.Clearly, the hypernymic ascription forprepositions is by analogy only.
To say that aboutisa of makes little sense.
In TPP, the lexicographerdevelops three pieces of information about eachsense: a semantic relation name, the properties ofthe prepositional object, and the properties of theword to which the prepositional phrase is attached.In analyzing the definition for about, of is attachedto the word subject.
Thus, nothing about theattachment properties of of can be inherited intosaying anything about the attachment properties ofabout.
At best, then, the semantic relation name andcomplement properties of the applicable sense of ofcan be inherited.
Indeed, this can be put into theform of a hypothesis: the semantic relation nameand the complement properties of an inheritedsense are more general than those of the inheritingsense.As mentioned above, the lexicographer hasdisambiguated the terminal preposition in sensesthat use one of the 13 prepositions that have beenanalyzed.
This has been done for 451 definitions inthe 411 senses.
It is noteworthy that in only 29cases did the lexicographer assign multiple senses(i.e., viewing the applicable sense as ambiguous).
Inother words, despite the fact that most of thesedefinitions contained only 4 or 5 words, sufficientcontext enabled resolution to a specific sense of thehypernym.
In 8 cases, the multiple inheritance was41SemanticRelation PrepositionComplementProperties DefinitionHypernymSemanticRelationHypernymComplementPropertiesOpposingForceagainst sth actively resisted in resistance to; asprotection fromThingPreventedparticiple or noundenoting thingpreventedThingSurmountedover a physical entity thatcan have sth above itextending directlyupwards fromSpaceOriginpoint in space orabstractionidentified as originThing Bored through permeable or breakablephysical objectso as to make a holeor opening in (aphysical object)ThingEnteredsth capable ofbeing entered or ofincorporating orenveloping inputBeneficiary for usually a person;otherwise, sth capable ofbenefittingon behalf of or to thebenefit of (someone orsomething)Recipient noun representingthe obj.

Inheritance of Semantic Relations and Complement Propertiesfor all senses, as in the case of frae, a Scottishdialectical form of from.In making the sense assignments, 175 of which(39 percent) involved of, the lexicographer notedthat a large number of cases (132 of 373) involvedphrasal prepositions that ended in of, e.g., into thearms of and in the name of.
In these cases, thedefinition (as developed by Oxford lexicographers)merely substituted one phrase ending in of for thephrase being defined (into the possession or controlof and for the sake of for the two examples).
Thisobservation was a major reason for requiring thatany hypernymic ascription within the prepositioninventory could not be based on the prototypical isahierarchy applicable to nouns.Among the 411 senses for which the terminalpreposition had been disambiguated, 48 sensesoccurred as definitions of the 13 prepositions thathave been analyzed in TPP.
For these 48 senses,each of which was fully characterized, thecharacterization of the terminal prepositions wasalso available, thus enabling us to test thehypothesis about what could be inherited.
Table 2shows the results for 6 of these senses, giving firstthe semantic relation assigned to the sense by thelexicographer, the preposition, the characterizationof the complement properties for that sense, thedefinition (with the hypernymic preposition in bold),the semantic relation of the sense that thelexicographer judged to be the appropriate sense ofthe hypernymic preposition, and the complementproperties of that sense.The examples in Table 2 support the hypothesisabout inheritance.
The other 42 cases are similar,although for some, the hypernymic semanticrelation or hypernymic complement properties arenot as close to the preposition sense beingexamined.
In a few cases, for example, thecomplement properties are as general as ?anynoun.?
In such cases, what gets inherited may notprovide much in the way of specificity to aid inanalyzing the behavior of the inheriting preposition.However, viewed from the perspective of thedigraph analysis performed in Litkowski (2002),this inheritance analysis provides confidence thatthere is an ordering relationship within thepreposition sense inventory that can be exploited.In the digraph analysis in Litkowski (2002),where the prepositions were analyzed as aggregatednodes, the inheritance mechanism provides the basisfor splitting nodes based on the specific senseassignments that can now be made.
In particular, inTable 3, showing one node of the prepositiondigraph that was characterized as a single strongcomponent (number 12) containing 33 prepositions,the sense-specific assignments will permit thedisaggregation of these prepositions into smallergroups that are closely related.42Table 3.
Strong ComponentsEntries12 in favour of, along with, with respect to,in proportion to, in relation to, inconnection with, with reference to, inrespect of, as regards, concerning, about,with, in place of, instead of, in support of,except, other than, apart from, in additionto, behind, beside, next to, following,past, beyond, after, to, before, in front of,ahead of, for, by, according toIn considering the type of analysis described byTable 2, it is important to note that the resultsfollowed from the reliance on a data-drivenapproach.
Characterizations of individual senses aremade locally with respect to observed behavior of asingle preposition.
It is only after these analysesthat results from several tables and spreadsheetscan be conjoined to produce something like Table 2.It is also important to note that the results inTable 2 must be viewed as preliminary.
Although itis expected that the central hypothesis aboutinheritance will remain valid, it is expected that thecharacterizations of the complement properties willundergo considerable refinement.
One of theprimary goals of TPP is to develop a data-driven setof disambiguation criteria for distinguishing amongpreposition senses.
Methods such as thosedeveloped by O?Hara (2005) and Boonthum et al(2006) suggest that refined characterizations willemerge.
The large instance sets (in Senseval format)will provide an ample data set for this analysis.Finally, it is expected that the semantic relationnames will also undergo some additional revisions.Again, since these names are developed locally withrespect to single prepositions, they do not reflectwhat may be a final set when they are analyzedtogether.
This is discussed in the next section.5 Next Steps for The Preposition ProjectThe analyses of issues concerning coverage andinheritance within the preposition sense inventorysuggest at least two major new goals for TPP.
Oneis the rationalization of the semantic relation typesand the other is the aggregation of characterizationsabout the senses into a convenient and usable datastructure, perhaps following WordNet.5.1 Rationalization of Semantic Relation TypesThe semantic relation types that have beendeveloped thus far in TPP have been extremelyuseful in assessing the current coverage of thesemantic space of prepositions and in examining thepossibilities of an inheritance structure for thesenses.
However, the analyses have shown thatthere are some gaps in broad coverage and somethat will affect fine-grained characterizations of thesemantic space.In performing the analyses of the 13prepositions and their 211 senses, the names for thesemantic relations for an individual prepositionhave been developed without regard to those fromother prepositions or the linguistic literature, basedon the individual definitions in ODE and theinstances from FrameNet that have been tagged.Although frame element names are available to thelexicographer when examining FrameNet instances,they are only in the background.
As a result, thesenames provide a data-driven basis forcharacterizing the semantic space of prepositions.Given the importance of these names for thetypes of analyses described above, it is valuable tocomplete the assignment of names, even without thefull-scale analysis of sentence instances.Completion of this task would represent only apreliminary assignment, modifiable when instancesare more fully analyzed.With a relatively complete set of semanticrelation types, ?rationalization?
of the set, i.e.,reorganization in such a way to make it morelogical and consistent can be performed.
At present,among the 211 semantic relation types, there are 36duplicate names, some appearing multiple times,e.g., AgentName appears 5 times.
Some names areonly slight variants of one another, such asTimeframe and TimePeriod.
Many names can begrouped together for analysis.
For example, in thetime space, such semantic relations asActivePeriod, ClockHour, CreationDate,FutureTime, Hour, PeriodBisected, PointInTime,TargetTime, TimeOrigin, and TimePeriod wouldbe examined together.In pursuing this rationalization, outsideresources can be used more efficiently.
Inparticular, the FrameNet naming conventions andinheritance hierarchy can be examined in moredetail (as well as critiqued).
In addition, it will bepossible to take into account other treatments ofparticular prepositions or fine-grained areas ofsemantic space more easily.Rationalization not only will ensure consistencyin naming, but provide a vehicle for appropriate43data-driven mapping.
This will provide a basis foror against conventional groupings that have beenposited in the linguistics and computationallinguistics literature.
It is not expected that thisrationalization will produce anything unexpected,but it will provide an underlying support forcharacterizing the range of prepositional meaning.5.2 Towards a WordNet Representation ofPrepositional MeaningThe amount of data generated in TPP has beenprodigious and is difficult to comprehend andexploit.
With a firmer basis established in section 4above for inheritance mechanisms, combined withthe digraph analysis described in Litkowski (2002),it seems possible to move toward a representationthat is similar to WordNet.By following the inheritance structure, based onthe analyses described in section 4, combined witha rationalization of semantic relation names, itseems likely that there will be a relatively smallnumber of primitive concepts.
The digraph analysisyields synsets in the manner of WordNet, so we canvisualize that nodes in a WordNet prepositionnetwork will consist of preposition names andpreposition glosses (i.e., definitions).
In addition,the objective will be to provide an improvedcharacterization of complement and attachmentproperties that will accompany each node.
Thus,such a WordNet-like preposition network willrepresent not only meanings, but also provide thecapability for disambiguation.6 ConclusionsAlthough only a small number of prepositions havebeen analyzed in The Preposition Project, the datathat has been generated has proved sufficient for abroad assessment of the range of prepositionmeaning.
Not only has it been possible todemonstrate that the project currently provides acomparable broad coverage, but also that it revealspotential gaps in previous analyses of coverage.The data has also proved sufficient for thearticulation of appropriate inheritance mechanismswithin the preposition sense inventory.
These resultshave permitted the development of procedures thatcan be used for mapping out the space of semanticroles.
In addition, with these results, it is possible tolay out steps toward a WordNet-like representationof prepositions and their behavior.ReferencesBonnie Dorr.
