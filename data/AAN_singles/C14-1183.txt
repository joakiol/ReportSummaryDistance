Recently, Nagata and Whittaker (2013) have shown thatlanguage family relationship among mother tongues is preserved in English written by Indo-European language speakers because of mother tongue interference.
At the same time, theirfindings further introduce the following two research questions: (1) Does the preservation uni-versally hold in non-native English other than in English of Indo-European language speakers?
(2) Is the preservation independent of proficiency in English?
In this paper, we address theseresearch questions.
We first explore the two research questions empirically by reconstructinglanguage family trees from English texts written by speakers of Asian languages.
We then dis-cuss theoretical reasons for the empirical results.
We finally introduce another hypothesis calledthe existence of a probabilistic module to explain why the preservation does or does not hold inparticular situations.1 IntroductionTransfer of linguistic systems of a mother tongue to another language, namely mother tongue interfer-ence, is often observable in the writing of non-native speakers.
The reader may be able to determinethe mother tongue of the writer of the following sentence from the underlined article error: The alienwouldn?t use my spaceship but the hers.
The answer would probably be French or Spanish; the defi-nite article is allowed to modify possessive pronouns in these languages, and the usage is sometimesnegatively transferred to English writing.Researchers in corpus linguistics including Swan and Smith (2001), Aarts and Granger (1998),and Altenberg and Tapper (1998) have been working on mother tongue interference to revealoverused/underused words, part of speech (POS), or grammatical items.
Recently, Nagata and Whittaker(2013) have shown that language family relationship between mother tongues is preserved in Englishwritten by Indo-European language speakers; because of the preservation, one can reconstruct a lan-guage family tree similar to the canonical Indo-European family tree (Beekes, 2011; Ramat and Ramat,2006) from their English writings.
They have further revealed factors contributing to the preservationof the language family relationship, which they show is useful for related natural language processing(NLP) tasks such as grammatical error detection/correction and native language identification (Wong andDras, 2009).At the same time, their findings further introduce the following two research questions: (1) Does thepreservation universally hold in non-native English?
(2) Is the preservation independent of proficiencyin English?
The results (Nagata and Whittaker, 2013) for English written by Indo-European languagespeakers suggest that the answer to question (1) is yes.
Based on this, we hypothesize that:Hypothesis I: The preservation of language family relationship universally holds in non-native English.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Apparently, this is not the case in languages in other language families.
In these languages,other properties than language family relationship may be more dominant.
Furthermore, Kachru?s ThreeCircles of English (Kachru, 1992) raises a question.
In Kachru?s model, world Englishes are classifiedinto the inner, outer, and expanding circles.
The inner circle roughly corresponds to the traditional nativespeakers of English.
The outer circle refers to the non-native varieties in the regions where Englishserves as a useful lingua franca.
The expanding circle roughly corresponds to the other non-nativespeakers of English.
Then, it would be difficult to answer question (1) for the outer circle of English(e.g., English in Hong Kong).
For example, on one hand, English in Hong Kong is expected to havemother tongue interference from Chinese language.
From this point of view, it is expected to have thefamily relationship with the Sino-Tibetan language family.
On the other hand, one can point out thatthe outer circle of English should be closer to native English than the expanding circle of English (e.g.,English in China) is.
This implies that English in Hong Kong might have some other relationship with themembers in the outer circle.
For question (2), the answer is likely no considering that theoretically, thehigher one?s proficiency is, the closer to native English his or her English becomes; it would be difficultto distinguish between native English and English of non-native speakers whose proficiency is very high.With this reason, we hypothesize that:Hypothesis II: The preservation of language family relationship is dependent on proficiency in English.In view of this background, we address these research questions in this paper.
We first examine the twohypotheses empirically by reconstructing language family trees from English texts written by speakersof Asian languages, including the outer and expanding circles of English.
If we can reconstruct languagefamily trees similar to their canonical family trees from these English texts, it will be a good piece ofevidence for Hypothesis I.
Similarly, to examine Hypothesis II, we reconstruct a language family treefrom the English texts using the information about their proficiency levels.
If we cannot reconstructlanguage family trees similar to the canonical trees, Hypothesis II will be accepted.
We then exploretheoretical reasons for the empirical results.
We finally introduce another hypothesis called the existenceof a probabilistic module to explain why the preservation does or does not hold in particular situations.The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
Sect.
2 introduces the basic approach of this work.Sect.
3 and Sect.
4 examine Hypothesis I and Hypothesis II, respectively.
Sect.
5 describes theoreticalreasons for the experimental results.2 Approach2.1 Data SetThrough this paper, we use the International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English (IC-NALE) (Ishikawa, 2011) as the target data to examine the two hypotheses.
ICNALE consists of Englishessays of the outer and expanding circles of English in Asia together with those of native speakers ofEnglish.
Table 1 (a) shows the statistics on ICNALE.In ICNALE, each essay, except native essays, is annotated with a proficiency level of the writer,ranging from A 2 (lowest) B1 1, B1 2, to B2+ (highest); Table 1 (b) shows the correspondence betweenthese four proficiency levels and TOEIC scores.
We use this information to examine Hypothesis II.2.2 Method for Reconstructing Language Family TreesWe employ the method proposed by Nagata and Whittaker (2013) for reconstructing language familytrees, which in turn is based on the method proposed by Kita (1999).
In this method, each group ofthe essays in ICNALE is modeled by an n-gram language model.
Then, agglomerative hierarchicalclustering (Han and Kamber, 2006) is applied to the language models to reconstruct a language familytree.
The distance used for clustering is based on a divergence-like distance between two languagemodels that was originally proposed by Juang and Rabiner (1985).1941Category # of essays # of tokensNative 400 88,792Outer CircleHong Kong 200 46,111Pakistan 400 93,100Philippines 400 96,586Singapore 400 96,733Expanding CircleChina 800 194,613Indonesia 400 92,316Japan 800 176,537Korea 600 130,626Thailand 800 176,936Taiwan 400 89,736(a) Statistics on ICNALELevel A2 B1 1 B1 2 B2+Score 225-549 550-669 670-784 785+(b) Correspondence between the Proficiency Levels andTOEIC ScoreTable 1: Summary of ICNALE.To explain the method in more detail, let us define the following symbols used in the method.
Let Dibe a set of English texts where i denotes a mother tongue i.
Similarly, letMibe a language model trainedusing Di.To reduce the influences from the topics of the data set, we use an n-gram language model based ona mixture of word and POS tokens.
In this language model, content words in n-grams are replaced withtheir corresponding POS tags.
This greatly decreases the influence of the topics of texts.
It also decreasesthe number of parameters in the language model.To build the language model, the following three preprocessing steps are applied to Di.
First, textsin Diare split into sentences.
Second, each sentence is tokenized, POS-tagged, and mapped entirely tolowercase.
For instance, the example sentence in Sect.
1 would give:the/DT alien/NN would/MD not/RB use/VB my/PRP$ spaceship/NN but/CC the/DT hers/PRP./.Finally, words are replaced with their corresponding POS tags; for the following words, word tokens areused as their corresponding POS tags: coordinating conjunctions, determiners, prepositions, modals, pre-determiners, possessives, pronouns, question adverbs.
Also, proper nouns are treated as common nouns.At this point, the special POS tags BOS and EOS are added at the beginning and end of each sentence,respectively.
For instance, the above example would result in the following word/POS sequence:BOS the NN would RB VB my NN but the hers .
EOS.Note that the content of the original sentence is far from clear while reflecting mother tongue interference,especially in the hers.Now, the language model Mican be built from Di.
We set n = 3 (i.e., trigram language model) anduse Kneser-Ney (KN) smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995) to estimate its conditional probabilities.The clustering algorithm used is agglomerative hierarchical clustering with the average linkagemethod.
The distance1between two language models is measured as follows.
The probability thatMigenerates Diis calculated by Pr(Di|Mi).
Note thatPr(Di|Mi) ?
Pr(w1,i) Pr(w2,i|w1,i)|Di|?t=3Pr(wt,i|wt?2,i, wt?1,i) (1)1It is not a distance in a mathematical sense.
However, we will use the term distance following the convention in theliterature.1942where wt,iand |Di| denote the tth token in Diand the number of tokens in Di, respectively, since weuse the trigram language model.
Then, the distance from Mito Mjis defined byd(Mi?
Mj) ?1|Dj|logPr(Dj|Mj)Pr(Dj|Mi).
(2)In other words, the distance is determined based on the ratio of the probabilities that each language modelgenerates the language data.
Because d(Mi?
Mj) and d(Mj?
Mi) are not symmetrical, we definethe distance between Miand Mjto be their average:d(Mi,Mj) ?d(Mi?
Mj) + d(Mj?
Mi)2.
(3)Equation (3) is used to calculate the distance between two language models for clustering.To sum up, the procedure of the language family tree construction method is as follows: (i) Preprocesseach Di; (ii) Build Mifrom Di; (iii) Calculate the distances between the language models; (iv) Clusterthe language data using the distances; (v) Output the result as a language family tree.3 Reconstructing Language Family Trees from Asian EnglishWe used the whole ICNALE as the target data.
We used a POS-tagger with the Penn Treebank Tag-set (Santorini, 1990), which we had specially developed for analyzing non-native English; we trained iton native and non-native corpora we had manually annotated with POS tags, part of which is available tothe public as the Konan-JIEM (KJ) learner corpus (Nagata et al., 2011).
Then, we generated a cluster treefrom the corpus data using the method described in Subsect.
2.2.
We used the Kyoto Language Modelingtoolkit2to build language models from the corpus data.
We removed n-grams that appeared less thanfive times3in each subcorpus in the language models.Fig.
1 shows the resulting cluster tree.
The number at each branching node denotes in which step thetwo clusters were merged.The cluster tree supportsHypothesis I that the preservation of language family relationship universallyholds in non-native English.
Although the detailed language family relationship is less well-known inthese Asian languages than in the Indo-European languages, still the cluster tree shown in Fig.
1 reflectsa rational interpretation of their language family relationship.
In the cluster tree, Taiwanese and ChineseEnglishes are first merged into a cluster.
This perfectly agrees with the fact that their mother tongues areprimarily Chinese and thus both should belong to the Sino-Tibetan language family.
In turn, Japaneseand Korean Englishes are merged into a cluster.
Their mother tongues are said to be a member of theAltaic language family.
Admittedly, it is still controversial whether the two languages belong to theAltaic language family or not.
However, the current research often treats them as a member of theAltaic language family (Crystal, 1997).
After Japanese and Korean Englishes, Thai and IndonesianEnglishes are merged in to a cluster of which mother tongues belong to different language families; theformer belong to the Thai language family while the latter mostly belong to the Austronesian languagefamily.
Having said that, it has been pointed out that Thai has some language family relationship withthe Austronesian language family (Crystal, 1997).
All these observations support Hypothesis I.Interestingly, the cluster tree shown in Fig.
1 preserves, together with language family relationship,the three circles of English, namely, the inner (native), outer, and expanding circles of English with anexception of Pakistani English.
This can be interpreted as that some other properties are more dominantthan language family relationship in the outer circle of English.
An implication from this is that we shouldnot treat the outer and expanding circles as a group of non-native speakers of English but separately asdifferent groups in the related NLP tasks such as grammatical error correction.
For example, a methodperforming well on the outer circle of English (e.g., the NUS corpus (Dahlmeier et al., 2013)) does notnecessarily perform equally well on the expanding circle of English (e.g., the CLC corpus) and viceversa.
Similarly, a model trained on English written by Indo-European language speakers may perform2The Kyoto Language Modeling toolkit: http://www.phontron.com/kylm/3We found that the results were not sensitive to the value of frequency cutoff so long as we set it to a small number.1943711PhilippineEnglish5Hon KongEnglish SingaporeanEnglishThai English Indonesian English3Chinese English TaiwaneseEnglish16 Inner circleExpanding circleOuter circleJapaneseEnglish KoreanEnglish2Native English1 Native English248109Pakistani EnglishFigure 1: Cluster Tree Reconstructed from Asian Englishes (ICNALE).better on Chinese English than a model trained on Hon Kong English does.
Above all, the subtree forthe outer circle of English is a piece of evidence that partly denies Hypothesis I.We further reconstructed a clustering tree from the same data set using 5-gram language models so thatthe resulting clustering reflects longer-distance syntactic relations.
Fig.
2 shows the resulting cluster tree,which reveals that the tree is almost the same as in Fig.
1 with an exception of the Philippine English.After having observed all these, it would be rational to partly accept Hypothesis I and to modify it asfollows:Hypothesis I?
: The preservation of language family relationship universally holds inthe expanding circle of English.4 Exploring Correlation between the Preservation and ProficiencyThe simplest way to examine Hypothesis II would be clustering that uses only either high-proficiency orlow-proficiency essays.
However, it is not so straightforward because the distribution of each proficiencylevel varies depending on the English groups.
Particularly, some of the 10 non-native Englishes containsno or very few low-proficiency essays4.As a simple solution, we first generated a clustering tree from only the high-proficiency essays (B1 2and B2+) with the same conditions as in Sect.
3.
As a more sophisticated solution, we created a newdata set from ICNALE so that one of the two Englishes merged into a cluster in Fig.
1 consists of onlylow-proficiency essays and the other of only high-proficiency essays.
For instance, we used only low-proficiency essays (A 2 and B1 1) for Chinese English and only high-proficiency essays (B1 2 and B2+)for Taiwanese English.
Then, we generated another cluster tree from the new data set again with thesame conditions as in Sect.
3.
In addition, as a reference, we generated a cluster tree only using theinformation about the proficiency levels.
In this clustering, we created a vector for each English whoseelements and values corresponded to the four proficiency levels and the relative frequencies of the essaysfalling into the corresponding proficiency level5.
In this method, we defined the distance for clusteringby the Euclidean distance between two vectors.The idea behind this experiment is as follows.
If the preservation is completely independent of profi-ciency, we will obtain the exact same tree as in Fig.1 both from the only-high-proficiency data set and thehigh-low proficiency-paired data set.
Otherwise, the cluster tree will result in a different form, similar tothe one obtained by the vector-based method solely relying on the information about proficiency.Fig.
1 and Fig.
3 show the cluster trees obtained from the only-high-proficiency data set and the high-low proficiency-paired data set, respectively.
In the case of the only-high-proficiency data set, the result-ing tree is the exact same as in the one generated from the original data set.
Fig.
3 also shows that thecluster tree is very similar to that in Fig.
1.
Besides, both tree are far from the cluster tree obtained by the4For instance, Singapore English contains no low-proficiency essays (A2 and B1 1), and Philippine English 26 essays outof 400.
See http://language.sakura.ne.jp/icnale/ for the complete list of the distribution.5We create vectors for the native English essays by setting 1.0 to the element corresponding to B2+ and 0.0 to the othersbecause proficiency levels are not available for the native English essays in ICNALE.1944811PhilippineEnglish4Hon KongEnglish SingaporeanEnglishThai English Indonesian English36 Inner circleExpanding circleOuter circleJapaneseEnglish KoreanEnglish5Native English1 Native English22710 9Pakistani EnglishChinese English TaiwaneseEnglish1Figure 2: Cluster Tree Reconstructed from Asian Englishes (ICNALE) using 5-gram language models.vector-based method solely relying on the information about proficiency as shown in Fig.
4.
In summary,Fig.
1 to 4 show that the preservation of language family relationship holds in the expanding circle ofEnglish regardless of proficiency in English.These results deny Hypothesis II that the preservation of language family relationship is dependenton proficiency in English.
Contrary to our expectation, they support6:Hypothesis II?
: The preservation of language family relationship is independent of proficiency in En-glish.5 DiscussionThe experiments show that the tree generation method relying on the distributions of word/POS se-quences reconstructs from Asian Englishes cluster trees reflecting the family relationship in the Asianlanguages.
These empirical findings, together with those about English written by Indo-European lan-guage speakers (Nagata and Whittaker, 2013), support Hypothesis I?.In order to explain theoretically Hypothesis I?, we introduce another hypothesis called the existenceof a probabilistic module, that is, that a probabilistic module that stores the distributional informationexists in the human brain.
We hypothesize that the probabilistic module consists of sets of probabilitieswhere each set corresponds to a linguistic item which has arbitrariness in its use; the arbitrariness isexpressed by means of the probabilities that one of the candidates allowed in the linguistic item is chosenin one?s mother tongue.
An example of such a linguistic item would be the position of adverb in Englishwhere the probabilities in this case represent how likely adverbs appear in certain positions (e.g., thebeginning, middle, and end of a sentence).
The probabilistic module is equipped with the values ofthe probabilities which are set according to one?s mother tongue.
To be precise, in our hypothesis, theprobabilities are adapted as follows: (1) proto-languages had developed their values of the probabilitiesand handed them down to their descendants; (2) over the time, some of the values changed and theothers remained unchanged; (3) in turn, the decedent languages handed their values of the probabilitiesto their descendants with the changes.
An example of this would be as follows.
The proto-Indo-Europeanlanguage handed down its values of the probabilities to, for example, the Proto-Germanic language andthe Proto-Italic language with some changes in the values.
Then the Proto-German language handedthem down to the Germanic languages such as German and Dutch, again with some changes.
So did theProto-Italic language to the romance languages such as French and Italian.
Therefore, the values of theprobabilities in German should be more similar to those in Dutch than to those in French or Italian.With this probabilistic module in the human brain, we can naturally explain the preservation of lan-guage family relationship.
When non-native speakers use English, the candidates of the arbitrary lin-guistic items in English are chosen according to the probabilistic module adapted to their mother tongue.6It would be worth while to see if Hypothesis II holds in the case of Indo-European Englishes.
The difficult part is thatthere are only a few data annotated with proficiency levels.1945811PhilippineHIGH6Hon KongLOW SingaporeanHIGHThai     LOW Indonesian HIGH4Chinese LOW TaiwaneseHIGH25JapaneseLOW KoreanHIGH1Native English1 Native English23710 9Pakistani LOWFigure 3: Cluster Tree Reconstructed from the High-low Proficiency-paired ICNALE Data Set (HIGH:high proficiency; LOW: low proficiency).711PhilippineEnglish9SingaporeanEnglishThai English IndonesianEnglish2Chinese EnglishTaiwaneseEnglish3KoreanEnglish Native English1 Native English214105Pakistani EnglishJapaneseEnglish6Hon KongEnglish8Figure 4: Cluster Tree Generated Based on Only Proficiency Levels.For example, speakers of languages which have a preference for sentence-beginning adverbs would alsoprefer sentence-beginning adverbs in English writing.
Accordingly, the values of the probabilities areimplicitly encoded in word/POS sequences such as BOS RB , and NN RB .7in their English writings, andthus the tree generation method can recognize language family relationship as language family trees viathe trigram language model.
Provided that the probabilistic module exists in the human brain, this argu-ment can be made about any mother tongues and the target language (not only English) as long as theyhave arbitrary linguistic items in their language systems, which should be the case in most languages.This is of course another hypothesis and we need more data and evidence to examine the hypothesis.Nagata and Whittaker (2013) show some evidence that implies the existence of a probabilistic module.They reveal that Englishes written by Indo-European language speakers exhibit certain probabilistic pat-terns at least in the way of constructing noun phrases (NPs), adverb positions, and article use, reflectingthe Italic, Germanic, and Slavic branches of the Indo-European family.
Take as an example Fig.
5 (i)which shows frequencies of the trigram NN of NN in English written by Indo-European language speak-ers8.
Here, note that English language has arbitrariness between the noun-noun compound and the NNof NN construction to form an NP (e.g., education system vs. system of education).
Fig.
5 (i) revealsthat speakers of the Italic languages (French, Italian, and Spanish) which have a preference for the NNof NN construction over the noun-noun compound exhibit relatively high frequencies of the trigram NNof NN in English writing.
Conversely, speakers of the Germanic languages (Dutch, Swedish, German,and Norwegian) have a preference for the noun-noun compound over the NN of NN construction ac-cordingly exhibit lower frequencies of the trigram NN of NN.
In total, the frequencies roughly classifythe 11 Englishes into three groups corresponding to the Italic, Slavic, and Germanic branches of the7These two trigrams roughly correspond to adverbs at the beginning and end of a sentence, respectively.8The ICLE corpus (Granger et al., 2009) was used to calculate the frequencies.

Fig.
5 (ii) reveals that the pairs of Englishes which share language family relationshipeach other exhibit similar frequencies of the trigram NN of NN as in Fig.
5.
Furthermore, Fig.
6 (i)shows a similar tendency in the distribution of adverb positions.
The horizontal and vertical axes ofFig.
6 correspond to the ratios of adverbs at the beginning and the end of sentences, respectively, in theAsian and native Englishes.
It turns out that the pairs again tend to be located in near positions in thedistribution.
All of these imply the existence of the probabilistic module.The probabilistic module also explains why the preservation is independent of proficiency.
It is be-cause the values of the probabilities in the probabilistic module will change quite slowly as one improveshis or her proficiency.
First of all, unlike grammatical errors, explicit feedback such as correction byteachers is not normally given to language learners in the case of the use of the arbitrary linguistic itemssince any choice among the candidates allowed in a linguistic item is normally correct, as in the adverbpositions in English: Already, I have done it., I have already done it., and I have done it already, al-though each of which might have a slightly difference in meaning.
Therefore, language learners havelittle opportunity to adapt the values of the probabilities in their probabilistic module to those in the targetlanguage in the first place.
Even if feedback is given, it would still be difficult to do so considering thatlearners scarcely observe the values of the probabilities directly.
This is why the values of the probabili-ties in the probabilistic module tend to be similar within a mother tongue regardless of one?s proficiencyin English.
We can actually see this in Fig.
6 (ii).
Fig.
6 (ii) shows the distribution of the ratios of adverbsat the beginning and the end of sentences in the high/low-proficiency essays in ICNALE where X-H andX-L denote high-proficiency and low-proficiency essays of X English, respectively (e.g., THA-H de-notes the high-proficiency essays of Thai English).
Fig.
6 (ii) reveals that Englishes of the same languagespeakers tend to remain in near positions regardless of the difference in proficiency.All these observations would be a good place to start to explore the existence of the probabilisticmodule.
The next step would be to name other arbitrary linguistic items concerning the probabilisticmodule, one of which for example might be the order of the main and subordinate clauses (e.g., BecauseI did it, I did it.
vs I did it because I did it.
), and then one can reveal their values (probabilities) dependingon mother tongues.6 ConclusionsIn this paper, we examined the following two hypotheses: Hypothesis I: The preservation of languagefamily relationship universally holds in non-native English; Hypothesis II: The preservation of languagefamily relationship is dependent on proficiency in English.

: The preser-vation of language family relationship universally holds in the expanding circle of English.
By contrast,the experimental results denied Hypothesis II, supporting the counter hypothesis: Hypothesis II?
: Thepreservation of language family relationship is independent of proficiency in English.
We then proposedanother hypothesis that a probabilistic module exists in the human brain to explain why Hypothesis I?andHypothesis II?hold.
We further introduced empirical data implying the existence of the probabilisticmodule.For future work, we will examine Hypothesis I?and II?using English texts written by speakers oflanguages in other families to see if the preservation really universally holds.
Also, we will explore theexistence of the probabilistic module.AcknowledgmentsThe author would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments and suggestionson this paper.ReferencesJan Aarts and Sylviane Granger, 1998.
