SEARCH AND INFERENCE STRATEGIES INPRONOUN RESOLUTION : AN E~ERIMENTAL STUDYKate EhrlichDepartment of PsychologyUnlversiCy of MassachusettsAmherst, ~ 01003The qusstlun of how people resolve pronouns has the various factors combine.been of interest to language theorists for a long timebecause so much of what goes on when people findreferents for pronouns seems to lie at the heart ofcomprehension.
However, despite the relevance of pro-nouns for comprehension and language cheorT, theprocesses chat contribute to pronoun resolution haveproved notoriously difficult Co pin down.Part of the difficulty arises from the wide rangeof fac=ors that can affect which antecedent noun phrasein a tex~ is usderstood to be co-referentlal with aparticular pronoun.
These factors can range from simplenumber/gender agreement through selectional rescrlc~ionsco quite complex "knowledge chat has been acquired fromthe CaxC (see Webber, (1978) for a neatly illustrateddescription of many of these factors).
Research inpsychology, artificial intelligence a~d linguistics hasgone a long way toward identifying some of these factorsand the i r  ro le  in pronoun reso lu~ion .
For  instance, inpsychology, research carried ouC by Caramazza =-d hiscolleagues (Caramazza et el, 1977) as well as researchchat I have dune (Ehrllch, 1980), has demuns~rated thatnumber/sender agreement really c=- fumcciun to  constrainthe choice of referent in a way Chat signiflcantlyfacilltaCes processing.
Within an AI framework, therehas been some very interesting work carried out bySidner (1977) m~d Grosz (1977) thac seeks to identifythe current topic of a Cex1: and co show Chat knowledgeof the topic can considerably s i l l i l y  pronoun reso-lutlon.I t  is important that people are  able co selectappropriate referents for pronouns and co have somebasis for that decision.
The research discussed so farhas mentioned some of the factors Chac contribute cochose decisiuns.
However, part of ~he problem of reallyunders tand ing  how people resolve pronouns is knowing howCertainly it is importanta~d useful to polnc to a particular factor as concri-butlng to a reference decision, but in many texts morethan one of these factors will be available to a readeror listener.
One problem for the theorist is then toexplaln which factor predominates in the decision aswell as to describe the scheduling of evaluaclon pro-cedures.
If it could be shown that there was a striccordering in which tests were applied, say, number/genderagreement followed by selectionai restrictions followedby inference procedures, pronoun resoluclon may be simp-ler to explain.
At our present level of knowledge it isdlfficulc to discern ordering principles chat have anydegree of generality.
For Instance, for every examplewhere the topic seems to determine choice, a sinLilarexample c~- often be found where the more recent ante-cedent is preferred over the one that forms part of thetopic.
Moreover, even this claim begs the quesclon ofhow the coplc can be identified unambiguously.A different approach is possible.
The process ofassigning a referent Co a pronoun c~m be viewed asutilizing two kinds of strategies.
One strategy is con-cerned with selecting the best referent from amongst thecandidates available.
The ocher strategy is concernedwith searching through memory for the candidates.These two types of strategy, which will be referred tomsem?-lically as inference and search strategies, havedifferent kinds of characteristics.
A search strategydictates the order in which candldaces are evaluated,but has no machinery for carrying out the evaluation.The inference strategy helps to set up the represen-taclon of the information in the cexC agains c which can-dldacas can be evaluated, but has ~o way of finding thec~aldidates.
~n the rest of this paper, she way thesestraCegles ~ighc interact will be explored and theresults of two studies will be reported that bear on89the issues.One possible search strategy is ~o examine can-didates serially beginning with the one menKioned mostrecently and working back through the text.
Thisstrategy makes some sense because, as Hobbs (1978) haspointed out, most pronouns co-refer with antecedentsChat were menr.laned with in  the  last few senuences.Thus, a serial search s~rategy provides a principledway of rescric~Lng how a text is searched.
Moreover,there is some evidence fro~ psychological research ~hatit takes longer to resolve pronouns when the antecedentwlch which the pronotn~ co-refers is far rather than nearthe pronoun (e.g.
Clark & $engul, 1979; SprlnEston,1975).
Although such distance effects have been usedto argue for differences in memory reErieval, wlCh thenearer antecedents bein 8 easier to retrieve Ch~ thefurther ones, none of the reported data rule out aserial search strategy.AS argued ear l ie r ,  a search  s~rar~Ey a lone  cannotaecoun~ for pronoun resoluLian because it lacks anymachinery for evaluation.
There are ,  however, manykinds of informa~io~ tha~ people ~ bring to bear whenevaluating c~dida~es and some of these were discussedearlier.
A c~on method is to decide between alder-native candidates on ~he basis of information gainedthrough inferences.
Inference is a rather u~iqui~ousand often ill-deflned no~ion, and, although it is beyondthe scope of this paper to clarify the concept, it isworth no~ing ~hat Chore are (at leas~) ~wo kinds ofinference chat play a role in anaphora generally.
Onekind which T will call 'lexlcal' inferences are.
drawnto establish Chat t~o different linguls~ic expressionsrefer ~o ~he same entity.
For insnance, in the follow-ing pair of sentences from Garrod and Sanford (1977):(I) A bus came roaring round the cornerThe vehicle nearly flattened a pedes~rlana 'lexlcal' inference esuabllshes that ~he particularvehicle mentluned in ~he second sentence is in fact abus.
Tnferences can also be drawn to support theselection of one referent over another.
In a sentencesuch as :(2) John sold a car to Fred because he needed ita series of inferences based in part an out knowledge ofselling a~d needing, supports ~he selection of Fredrather ~h=m John as referent for the pronoun "he".
Inthe experiments to be reported, it was 'lexical'inferences ra~her ~han the oCher kind that were mani-pulated.Subjects in ~he experiment were asked to read textssuch as the a~e given below:(3) Fred was outside all dayJohn was inside all daya) He had a sleep inside after lunchb) He had a sleep in his room after lunchand then immedla~ely after, answer a question such as'~dho had a sleep after lunchY" Chat was designed toelicit the referent of the pranou~ in ~he las~ sentence.Two factors were independently varied.
The antecedentcould be near or far from the pronoun, ~he lacieraffected by switching the order of the first ?wo sen-~ences.
The second factor was whether a 'bridg~Ing'inference had to be drw~n ~o es~chllsh co-referencebed, sen part of the predlca~e of the lasc sentence and~he target  sentence .
The ~o vers ions ,  (a)  no  in ferenceand (b) inference, are shown as alternative ~hird sen-canoes in example (3) -hove.
The principal measureswere ~he Lime to answer ~he question and ~he accuracy of~he respunse.The experi-~ent addresses ~wo critical issues.
Oneis whether ~he 'lewical' inference is drEdn as part ofthe evaluaLion procedure, or, whether it is drawn in-dependently of Cha~ process.
The o~her issue concernsthe search sura~eEy itself: do subjects examine can-dlda~es serially, and, if so, do they s~ill use oChercriteria to reject the first canal/dace and choose thesecond?
Two dlstincc models of processing can be con-s~rucced from a conslderarion of Chess issues.
In thecase where inferences are triggered by the need ~o9Oevaluate a candidate, any effect due to extra processingshould be unaffected by whether the antecedent ks nearor far from the pronoun.
In either case the inferencewill be drawn in response to r/Re need to decide on theacceptability of the candidate.
In the second model,the inference is triggered by the anaphoric expression,e.g.
"in his room" An the third sentence, and the needto relate chat expression to the location "inside" men-tioned in a previous sentence.
The inference is ex-pected to take a certain amotmt of time to be drawn(cf.
Kintsch, 1974).
According to the second model,one would expect that in cases where the antecedent isnear the pronoun, there will be some effect due toinference because the process may not be completed intime to answer the question.
When the antecedent is farfrom the pronoun, however, the inference process willbe completed and hence no effect of inference shouldstill be detected.
The two models assume rationality onthe part of the subjects; that is, they assume thatsubjects will accurately select the further antecedentwhere appropriate even though recency would predictselecr.lon of the first candidate that is evaluated.
Ifthis assumption ks valid, subjects should select thefar antecedent where appropr ia te  mere often than the(erroneous) near candidate.The results of the experiment, shown An Table 1,support the second model; ' lexlcal' inferences aredrawn only once and in response to an anaphoric expres-sion.
The data also provide evidence of a serial searchstrategy by showing that there are more errors andlonger latencles associated with far rather than nearantecedents.
The data further show that even when thecorrect choice is far from the pronoun, subjects willchoose it in preference to ~he nearer condidate, thusdemonstrating that a serial search strategy alone can-not predict the choice of referent.The inferences that subjects had to draw in thisexperiment concerned simple lexlcal relations.
Theincrease in latency due to having drawn such an infer-ence supports the resul~s of earlier studies, par-tlcularly those of Garrod and Sanford (1977).
Whac thepresent study fails to do, however, is to determinewhether that inference ks drawn spontaneously, whilereading.
Previous research (e.g., ~intsch, 1974, Garrodald Sanford, 1977) has shown ~hat inferences are morelikely to be drawn while reading ~han at a responsestage.
It was thus of some interest to know when ~helexical inferences in ~he present study were drawn.This issue was examined by modifying the previous ex-periment to include both an additional measure of read-ing time and a 1.5s delay between presentation and test.The latter modification is important since if subjectsare drawing inferences while reading, ~he process maynot  be completed by the time the question is askedi~mnedlately after presentation.
The introduction of adelay also allows for a further test of the two pro-ceasing modeled outlined earlier.
If indeed 'lexlcal'inferences are drawn to establish co-reference betweenanaphoric expressions rather than to determine pro-nominal reference, as the previous experiment indicated,then there should be an effect of inference on reading~ime but not at response when there is a delay, becauseby response ~he inference should have been dr~m.
Thedata were consistent with this hypothesis.
However,what also emerged from the second study was that onlysome of ~he passages seemed to elicit inferences atreading; the number of passages was increased in thesecond experiment ro corn%tar possible repetitioneffects.
In fact, for half the passages subjects res-ponded by saying there was no answer.
An example ofsuch a passage is given below:(4) Jill had a newspaper in the living-roomAnn had a book in the living-roomShe read some chemistry An the eveningIt was also the case for these passages that the in-ferences did not seem to be drawn while reading butrather in response to the question.
There is somedoubt here about cause and effect, nevertheless, the91observation raises some in~eresclng questions con-cerning wha~ triggers an inference to be drawn.
Oneanswer, supplied by Garrod & Sanford in ~heir experi-ment.s, is thac a relation ba leen  e~cpressioas musesomeh~ be perceived before an inference is drawn tode~e~-mlne ~e nature of ~he relation.
I~n o~her words,people do not draw inferences randomly to relate lln-8uisuic expressions.
Thus, whereas Garrod & $anfordfound ~ha~ subjects would infer co-reference between"bus" and "vehicle" in exa~le  (i), they failed to makethat connection, qu i~ rightly, in a slnuLlar passageshown below:(5) A bus came roar ing  round the  cornerIt nearly smashed some vehiclesWhat kinds of strategies do readers adop~ whenthey search ~heir memory to find plausible referentsfor pronouns?
Resul~s of che experiments reported herepoint ~o a strategy in which an~ities are examinedserially from ~he pronoun.
The purpose of a serialsearch strategy is to provide a principled we7 in whichreaders can ex"rn'Ine ~ho~e entities they have stored inmmory ,  for ~heir appropriateness as ~he referent of aparticular prono ~-~.
The strategy is ~hus unnecessarywhen there  is only one emr /~y in  memory by vlr~ue ofsim~le criteria such as humor  and gender agreementwi~h ~he pronoun.
What cons~.Itutes 'simple' criteriai s ,  o f  course ,  an open quest ion ;  che answer ,  however ,w i l l  mater ia l l y  a f fec t  ~he app l i cab i l i ty  o f  ~he searchs~rategy.The ~t  important part of reference resolution is,however, deciding on the referent.
A serial searchstrategy has no machinery for evaluating candidates, i~can only direct ~he order in which candidates areexamined.
The process of selecting a plausible referentdepends on ~he inferences a reader has drawn while ~he~ext is read.
Thus, when subjects found i~ hard ~oselec~ a referent at all ~hey also failed to draw m~myinferences while ~hey read ~he ~ext.
Moreover, because~he inferences for ~hese passa8es did seem to be drawnin response to a question ellci~Ing ~he referent, ~hei,~llcarAon is that inferences for che clearer materialare generally drawn spontaneously and before a specificneed for ~he informar.lon arises.
One can conjecturefrom ~hese data that the select_ion of plausible refer-an~s is dependent on how well a reader has understood~he preceding text.
If inferences are not drawn on~ila specific need arises, such as finding a referent, ~henit may be too late, to selec~ a referent easily oraccurately, l~us, reference can also be viewed in termsof what a ~ext makes available for anaphoric reference(cf.
Webber, 1978).The picture of pronoun resolution that emergesfrom the studies reported here, is one in which effectsof distance between the pronoun and its antecedent mayplay some role, not as a predicator of pronominalreference as has often been ~houEht, but as part of asearch strateEy.
There certainly are cases where nearerantecedents seem to be preferred over ones further backin the text; however, it is more profitable to look ~oconcepts such as foregroundin E (of.
Chafe, 1974) ratherthan silnple recency for explanations of the preference.?
It is also of some interest to have shown that infer-ences ~my con~rlbute ~o pronoun resolution huc drawnfor other reasons.R~KENCESCarama~za, A., Grober, E., Garvey, C. and Yates, J.
