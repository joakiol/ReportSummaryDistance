Heeman, Rebecca Lunsford, Ethan Selfridge, Lois Black, and Jan van SantenCenter for Spoken Language UnderstandingOregon Health & Science Universityheemanp@ohsu.eduAbstractLittle research has been done to exploredifferences in the interactional aspects ofdialogue between children with Autis-tic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and thosewith typical development (TD).
Quantify-ing the differences could aid in diagnosingASD, understanding its nature, and betterunderstanding the mechanisms of dialogueprocessing.
In this paper, we report on astudy of dialogues with children with ASDand TD.
We find that the two groups differsubstantially in how long they pause be-fore speaking, and their use of fillers, ac-knowledgments, and discourse markers.1 IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) form a groupof severe neuropsychiatric conditions whose fea-tures can include impairments in reciprocal socialinteraction and in communication (APA, 2000).These impairments may take different forms,ranging from individuals with little or no com-munication to fully verbal individuals with fluent,grammatically correct speech.
In this latter verbalgroup, shortcomings in communication have beennoted, including using and processing social cuesduring conversations.
This is no surprise, sincenegotiating a conversation requires many abilities,several of which are generally impaired in ASD,such as generating appropriate prosody (Kanner,1943) and ?theory of mind?
(Baron-Cohen, 2000).We make a distinction between transactionaland interactional aspects of dialogue (Brown andYule, 1983).
The transactional aspect refers tomessage content and interactional focuses on ex-pressing social relations and personal attitudes.In this paper, we focus on surface behaviorsthat speakers use to help manage the interaction,namely turn-taking, and the use of fillers, dis-course markers, and acknowledgments.
One ad-vantage of these behaviors is that they do not re-quire complete understanding of the dialogue, andthus lend themselves to automatic analysis.
Inaddition, these behaviors are under the speaker?scontrol and should be robust to what the otherspeaker is doing.
We hypothesize that just as in-teractional aspects in general are affected in ASD,so are these surface behaviors.
However, to ourknowledge, little or no work has been done on this.Investigating how the interactional aspects ofdialogue are affected in ASD serves several pur-poses.
First, it can help in the diagnostic process.Currently, diagnosing ASD is subjective.
Objec-tive measures based on dialogue interaction couldimprove the reliability of the diagnostic process.Second, it can help us refine the behavioral phe-notypes of ASD, which is critical for progress onthe basic science front.
Third, it can help us re-fine therapy for people with ASD to address di-alogue interaction deficits.
Fourth, understand-ing what dialogue aspects are affected in high-functioning verbal children with ASD can help de-termine which aspects of dialogue are primarilysocial in nature.
For example, do speakers usefillers to signal that there is a communication prob-lem, or are fillers a symptom of it (cf.
Clark andFox Tree, 2002)?In this paper, we report on a study of interac-tional aspects of dialogues between clinicians andchildren with ASD.
The dialogues were recordedduring administration of the Autism DiagnosticObservation Schedule (Lord et al, 2000), whichis an instrument used to assist in diagnosing ASD.We compare the performance of these childrenwith a group of children with typical development(TD).2 DataThe data used in this paper was collected dur-ing administration of the ADOS on 22 TD chil-dren and 26 with ASD, ranging in age from 4 to8 years old.
The children with ASD were high-functioning and verbal.
The speech of the clini-cian and child was transcribed into utterance-likeunits, with a start and an end time.
Activities wereannotated in a separate tier.
The transcriptions in-cluded the punctuation marks ?.
?, ?!
?, and ???
tomark syntactically and semantically complete sen-249tences, and ?>?
to mark incomplete ones.
As a sin-gle audio channel was used, the timing of overlap-ping speech was marked as best as possible.
Eachchild on average said 2221 words, 574 utterances,and 316 turns.3 ResultsPauses between Turns: We first examine howlong children wait before starting their turn.
Wehypothesized that children with ASD would waitlonger on average to respond, either because theyare less aware of (a) the turn-taking cues, (b) thesocial obligation to minimize inter-turn pauses, or(c) they have a slower processing and responsetimes.
For this analysis, we look at all turns inwhich there is no overlap between the beginning ofthe child?s turn and the clinician?s speech.
Data isavailable on 4412 pauses for the TD children and5676 for the children with ASD.
The grand meansof the children?s pauses are shown in Table 1 alongwith the standard deviations.
The TD children?saverage pause length is 0.876s.
For the childrenwith ASD, it is 1.115s, 27.3% longer.
This dif-ference is significant, a-priori independent t-testt=2.34 (df=39), p<.02 one-tailed.TD ASDall 0.876 (0.24) 1.115 (0.45)after question 0.748 (0.25) 1.005 (0.40)after non-question 1.076 (0.37) 1.329 (0.74)Table 1: Pauses before new turns.We also examine the pauses following ques-tions by the clinician versus non-questions.
Ques-tions are interesting as they impose a social obli-gation for the child to respond, and they havestrong prosodic cues at their ending.
We identifiedquestions as utterances transcribed with a ques-tion mark, which might include rhetorical ques-tions.
After a non-question (e.g., a statement), theaverage pause is 1.076s for the TD children and1.329s for children with ASD.
This difference isnot statistically significant by independent t-test,t<1.6, NS.
After a question, the average pauseis 0.748s for the TD children and 1.005s for thechildren with ASD, a significant difference by a-priori independent t-test t=2.72 (df=42), p<.005one-tailed.
The ASD children on average take34.4% longer to respond.
Thus, after a question,the difference between children with TD and ASDis more pronounced.Pauses by Activity: The ADOS includes hav-ing the child engage in different activities.
Forthis research, we collapse the activities into threetypes: converse is when there is no non-speechtask; describe is when the child is doing a men-tal task, such as describing a picture; and play iswhen the child is interacting with the clinician ina play session.
To better understand the differencebetween questions and non-questions, we examinethe pauses in each activity (Table 2).TD ASDquestion non-ques.
question non-ques.converse 0.730 0.30 0.656 0.27 0.890 0.34 0.932 0.88describe 0.853 0.44 0.879 0.37 1.056 0.51 1.282 1.21play 0.720 0.34 1.825 0.78 1.289 1.51 1.887 1.37Table 2: Pauses for each type of activity.After a question, the TD children tend to re-spond with similar pauses in each activity (the dif-ferences in column 2 between activities are notsignificant by pairwise paired t-test, all t?s<1.6,NS).
After a question, the child has a social obli-gation to respond, and this does not seem to beoverridden by whether there is a separate taskthey are involved in.
Even after a non-question,conversants have a social obligation to keep thespeaking floor occupied and so to minimize inter-utterance pauses (Sacks et al, 1974).
However, asseen in the third column, the pauses are affectedby the type of activity, and the differences arestatistically significant by pairwise paired t-test,(df=21), two-tailed: converse-describe t=2.24,p<.04; describe-play t=5.68, p<.0001; converse-play t=6.87, p<.0001.
The biggest difference iswith play.
Here, it seems that the conversantsphysical interaction lessens the social obligationof maintaining the speaking floor.
These findingsare interesting for social-linguistics as it suggeststhat the social obligations of turn-taking are al-tered by the presence of a non-speech task.We next compare the children with ASD to theTD children.
For the converse activity, we see thatthe children with ASD take longer to respond, af-ter questions and non-questions.
The differenceafter questions is significant by independent t-test,t=1.74 (df=46) p<.05, one-tailed, whereas the dif-ference after non-questions is marginal, t=1.47(df=28) p<.08.
This result could be explained bythe slower processing and response times associ-ated with ASD.Just as with the TD children, we see that aftera non-question, the children with ASD take longerto respond when there is another task.
The differ-ences in pause lengths between converse and playare significant, by paired t-test, t=2.89 (df=23)250p<.009, two-tailed.
The difference between de-scribe and play is marginal, t=2.03 (df=25) p<.06,and there was no significant difference betweenconverse and describe, t<1, NS.After a question, the children with ASD takelonger to respond when there is another task, espe-cially for play, although the pairwise differences inpause length between activities are not significant.This suggests that the children with ASD becomedistracted when there is another task, and so be-come less sensitive to either the question prosodyor the social obligation of questions.Fillers: We next examine the rate of fillers, atthe beginning of turns, beginning of utterances,and in the middle of utterances.
We look at thesecontexts individually as fillers can serve differentroles, such as turn-taking, stalling for time or aspart of a disfluency, and their role is correlatedto their position in a turn.
The rates are reportedin Table 3, along with the total number of fillerswithin each category.
Interestingly, the rate of ?uh?between children with TD and ASD is similar forall positions (independent t-test, all g?s<1, NS).uh umTD ASD TD ASDturn init.

Children with ASD use it signifi-cantly less than the TD children in every position,from 1/2 the rate in turn-initial position to 1/5 inutterance-medial position, independent two-tailedt-test: turn initial t=2.74 (df=38), p<.01; utteranceinitial t=2.53 (df=31), p<.02; and utterance me-dial t=3.94 (df=24), p<.001.TD ASDconverse 1.76% 569 0.56% 190describe 1.15% 115 0.33% 31play 0.96% 124 0.45% 58Table 4: Use of ?um?
by activity.We also examined the overall usage of ?um?
ineach activity (Table 4).
The TD children use ?um?more often in each activity than the children withASD, and the differences are statistically signif-icant by independent two-tailed t-test: converset=3.62 (df=29), p<.002; describe t=2.83 (df=27),p<.01; play t=2.42 (df=33), p<.03.
This resultsupports the robustness of the findings about ?um?.Many researchers have speculated on the roleof ?um?
and ?uh?.
In recent work, Clark and FoxTree (2002) argued that they signal a delay, andthat ?um?
signals more delay than ?uh?.
They viewboth as linguistic devices that are planned for, justas any other word is.
Our work suggests that ?um?and ?uh?
arise from different cognitive processes,and that the process that accounts for ?uh?
is notaffected by ASD, while the process for ?um?
is.1Acknowledgments: We next look at the rate ofacknowledgments: single word utterances that areused to show agreement or understanding.
Thus,the use of acknowledgments requires awareness ofthe other person?s desire to ensure mutual under-standing.
As the corpus did not have these wordsexplicitly marked, we identify a word as an ac-knowledgment if it meets the following criteria:(a) it is one of the words listed in Table 5 (basedon Heeman and Allen, 1999); (b) it is first in thespeaker?s turn; and (c) it does not follow a questionby the clinician.
The TD children used acknowl-edgments in 17.42% of their turns that did not fol-low a question, while the children with ASD didthis only 13.39% of the time (Table 5), a statis-tically significant difference by a-priori indepen-dent t-test t=1.78 (df=46), p<.05 one-tailed.TD ASDtotal 17.42% 568 13.39% 459yeah 7.49% 248 5.87% 215no 2.78% 78 2.06% 63mm-hmm 2.06% 75 1.07% 35mm 0.99% 29 1.35% 42ok 1.87% 65 0.83% 27yes 0.92% 32 0.88% 32right 0.14% 5 0.23% 8hm 0.73% 21 0.69% 20uh-huh 0.44% 15 0.42% 17Table 5: Use of acknowledgments.Discourse Markers: We next examine dis-course markers, which are words such as ?well?and ?oh?
that express how the current utterancerelates to the discourse context (Schiffrin, 1987).We classified a word as a discourse marker if itwas the first word in an utterance and is one ofthe words in Table 6 (Heeman and Allen, 1999).As shown in Table 6, the children with ASD usediscourse markers significantly less than the TDchildren in both conditions by a-priori indepen-dent, one-tailed t-test: turn-initial t=3.24 (df=43)p<.002; utterance-initial t=4.01 (df=44) p<.0001.1In Lunsford et al (2010) we investigate the rate andlength of pauses after ?uh?
and ?um?.
In addition, we veri-fied the t-tests using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.251As can be seen, most of the difference is in the useof ?and?.
The data for the other discourse markerswas sparse, so we compared ?and?
against all of theothers combined.
The decreased usage of ?and?in the ASD children is statistically significantfor both conditions by a-priori independent, one-tailed t-test: turn-initial t=4.47 (df=30), p<.0001;utterance-initial t=3.79 (df=43), p<.0002.
Thereis little difference in the use of all of the other dis-course markers combined, and the difference is notstatistically significant.Turn Initial Utterance InitialTD ASD TD ASDall 19.2% 1290 12.8% 1196 28.7% 2053 19.4% 1330and 10.7% 731 5.0% 471 19.5% 1419 12.0% 844then 0.6% 38 1.0% 89 1.5% 97 1.4% 79but 2.1% 144 1.3% 113 3.6% 238 2.7% 194well 2.2% 143 2.7% 271 1.1% 74 1.2% 79oh 2.0% 135 1.8% 160 1.0% 67 1.3% 68so 1.2% 75 0.7% 60 1.6% 129 0.7% 49wait 0.2% 9 0.2% 21 0.2% 17 0.2% 15actually 0.2% 15 0.1% 11 0.2% 12 0.0% 2not and 8.5% 559 7.8% 725 9.2% 634 7.4% 486Table 6: Use of discourse markers.The use of ?and?
is also lower in each activityfor the ASD children (Table 7), a significant dif-ference by a-priori independent one-tailed t-test:converse t=3.00 (df=41), p<.003; describe t=4.79(df=38), p<.0001, play t=4.07 (df=30), p<.0002.TD ASDconverse 13.36% 1139 7.95% 755describe 21.77% 587 10.76% 339play 12.97% 424 5.18% 221Table 7: Use of ?and?
in each activity.One explanation for the decreased usage of?and?
and not the other discourse markers mightbe that, of all the discourse markers, ?and?
seemsto have the least meaning.
It simply signifiesthat there is some continuation between the newspeech and the previous context.
This might makeit difficult for children with ASD to learn its use.
Asecond explanation is that the children with ASDare using ?and?
correctly, but simply do not pro-duce as many utterances that are related to the pre-vious context (cf.
Bishop et al, 2000).4 ConclusionIn this paper, we examined a number of interac-tional aspects of dialogue in the speech of childrenwith ASD and TD.
We found that children withASD have a lower rate of the filler ?um?, acknowl-edgments, and the discourse marker ?and.?
We alsofound that in certain situations, they take longer torespond.
These deficits might prove useful for im-proved diagnosis of ASD.
We also found that chil-dren with ASD have a lower rate of ?um?
but notof ?uh?, and that only the discourse marker ?and?seems to be affected.
This might prove useful forboth better understanding the nature of ASD aswell as better understanding the role of these phe-nomena in dialogue.
Although the results reportedin this work are preliminary, they do show the po-tential of our approach.
More work is needed toensure that our automatic identification of turn-taking events, discourse markers, and acknowl-edgments is correct and to explore alternate expla-nations for the results that we observed.AcknowledgmentsFunding gratefully received from the National In-stitute of Heath under grants IR21DC010239 and5R01DC007129, and the National Science Foun-dation under IIS-0713698.
