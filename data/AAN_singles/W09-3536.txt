The output from theFSM is filtered with the word language modelto produce the correct Hindi output.
The mainproblem handled is the case of omission of di-acritical marks from the input Urdu text.
Oursystem produces the correct Hindi output evenwhen the crucial information in the form of di-acritic marks is absent.
The approach improvesthe accuracy of the transducer-only approachfrom 50.7% to 79.1%.
The results reportedshow that performance can be improved usinga word language model to disambiguate theoutput produced by the transducer-only ap-proach, especially when diacritic marks are notpresent in the Urdu input.1 IntroductionTransliteration is a process to transcribe a wordwritten in one language, in another language bypreserving its articulation.
It is crucial for han-dling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in differ-ent domains of Natural Language Processing(NLP), especially in Machine Translation(Knight and Graehl, 1998; Knight and Stall,1998; Paola and Sanjeev, 2003), Cross-LingualInformation Retrieval (Pirkola et al, 2003), thedevelopment of multi-lingual resources (Yan etal., 2003) and multi-lingual text and speechprocessing.
It is also useful for Inter-dialectaltranslation without lexical changes and some-times it is mandatory when the dialects in ques-tion use mutually incomprehensible writing sys-tems.
Such cases exists in Malay (written in 2different scripts), Turkish (2 scripts), Kurdish (3scripts), Hindi/Urdu (2 scripts), Punjabi (2scripts), etc., where words are transliterated fromone script to the other, irrespective of their type(noun, verb, etc., and not only proper nouns andunknown words).
In this study, we will focus onHindi/Urdu example.Hindi and Urdu are written in two mutuallyincomprehensible scripts, Devanagari and Urduscript ?
a derivative of Persio-Arabic script re-spectively.
Hindi and Urdu are the official lan-guages of India and the later is also the Nationallanguage of Pakistan (Rahman, 2004).
Table 1gives an idea about the number of speakers ofHindi and Urdu.Native Speaker2nd Lang.Speaker TotalHindi 366 487 853Urdu 60.29 104 164.29Total 426.29 591 1,017.29Source: (Grimes, 2000) all numbers are in millionsTable 1: Hindi and Urdu SpeakersNotwithstanding the transcriptional differences,Hindi and Urdu share phonology, grammar,morphology, literature, cultural heritage, etc.People from Hindi and Urdu communities canunderstand the verbal expressions of each otherbut the written expression of one community isalien to the other community.A finite-state transliteration model for Hindiand Urdu transliteration using the Universal In-termediate Transcription (UIT ?
a pivot betweenthe two scripts) was proposed by Malik et al(2008).
The non-probabilistic finite-state modelis not powerful enough to solve all problems ofHindi ?
Urdu transliteration.
We visit and ana-lyze Hindi ?
Urdu transliteration problems inthe next section and show that the solution ofthese problems is beyond the scope of a non-probabilistic finite-state transliteration model.177Following this, we show how a statistical modelcan be used to solve some of these problems,thereby enhancing the capabilities of the finite-state model.Thus, we propose a hybrid transliterationmodel by combining the finite-state model andthe statistical word language model for solvingHindi ?
Urdu transliteration problems, dis-cussed in section 2.
Section 3 will throw light onthe proposed model, its different components andvarious steps involved in its construction.
In sec-tion 4, we will report and various aspects of dif-ferent experiments and their results.
Finally, wewill conclude this study in section 5.2 Hindi Urdu TransliterationIn this section, we will analyze Hindi ?
Urdutransliteration problems and will concentrate onUrdu to Hindi transliteration only due to shortageof space and will discuss the reverse translitera-tion later.
Thus, the remainder of the section ana-lyzes the problems from Urdu to Hindi translite-ration.2.1 Vowel, Yeh (?)
and Waw (?
)Urdu is written in a derivation of Persio-Arabicscript.
Urdu vowels are represented with the helpof four long vowels Alef-madda (?
), Alef (?
),Waw (?
), Yeh (?)
and diacritical marks.
Onevowel can be represented in many ways depend-ing upon its context or on the origin of the word,e.g.
the vowel [?]
is represented by Alef-madda(?)
at the beginning of a word, by Alef (?)
in themiddle of a word and in some Persio-Arabic loanword, it is represented by the diacritical markKhari Zabar (G?).
Thus Urdu has very complexvowel system, for more details see Malik et al(2008).
Urdu contains 10 vowels, and 7 of themalso have their nasalization forms (Hussain,2004; Khan, 1997) and 15 diacritical marks.Thou diacritical marks form the cornerstone ofthe Urdu vowel system, but are sparingly used(Zia, 1999).
They are vital for the correct Urdu toHindi transliteration using the finite-state transli-teration model.
The accuracy of the finite-statetransliteration model decreases from above 80%to 50% in the absence of diacritical marks.
Fig-ure 1 shows two example Urdu phrases (i) withand (ii) without the diacritical marks and theirHindi transliteration using the finite-state transli-teration model.
Due to the absence of Zabar (F?
)in the first and the last words in (1)(ii) and in the5th word in (2)(ii), vowels ?
?
[?]
and ?
[?]
aretransliterated into vowels ??
[e] and ?
[o] re-spectively.
Similarly, due to the absence of Pesh( E?)
and Zer (G?)
in 3rd and 4th words respectivelyin (1)(ii), both vowels ?
?
[?]
and ??
[?]
are con-verted into the vowel [?].
All wrongly convertedwords are underlined.

* Zero (0) means deleted.Table 2: Vowel Problems from Urdu to HindiLong vowels Yeh (?)
[j] and Waw (?)
[v] arealso used as consonants and certain contextualrules help us to decide whether they are used as aconsonant or as a vowel, e.g., Yeh (?)
and Waw(?)
are used as consonants at the start of a wordand after the long vowel Alef-madda (?
), etc.
Fi-178nite-state transliteration model can exploit suchcontextual rules but it is not possible to decideYeh (?)
and Waw (?)
as consonants in the ab-sence of diacritics.
Thus a finite-state translitera-tion model wrongly converts consonant Yeh (?
)and Waw (?)
into vowels ??
[e] and ??
[o], alsogiven in Table 2, instead of consonants Ya (?
)and Wa (?)
respectively, e.g., in the word ?????
(prince) [k?
?vr], Waw is wrongly converted intothe vowel [o] due to the absence of Zabar ( F?
)after it and the word becomes [k?nor], which isnot a valid word of Hindi/Urdu.2.2 Native SoundsThe Hindi writing system contains some nativesounds/characters, e.g., vocalic R (?)
[r?
], retrof-lex form of Na (?)
[?
], etc.
On the other handUrdu does not have their equivalents.
Thuswords containing such sounds are transcribed inUrdu with their approximate phonetic equiva-lents.
All such cases are problematic for Urdu toHindi transliteration and are given in Table 3.Sr.

[h]Table 3: Sounds of Sanskrit Origin2.3 Conjunct FormThe Hindi alphabet is partly syllabic becauseeach consonant inherits the vowel [?].
Two ormore consonants may be combined together toform a cluster called Conjunct that marks theabsence of the inherited vowel [?]
between con-sonants (Kellogg, 1872; Montaut, 2004).
Con-junction is also used to represent the geminationof a consonant, e.g., ?[k]+??+?[k]=???
[kk]where ??
is the conjunct marker and aspiration ofsome consonants like ?
[n], ?
[m], ?
[r] and ?
[l] when used as conjunction with ?
[h], e.g.,?
[n] + ??
+ ?
[h] = ???[nh].
Conjunction has a spe-cial meaning but native speakers use conjunctforms without any explicit rule (Montaut, 2004).On the other hand, Urdu uses Jazam ( H?
?
adiacritic) and Shadda (H?)
to mark the absence ofa vowel between two consonants and geminationof a consonant respectively.
In the absence ofthese diacritics in the input Urdu text, it is notpossible to decide on the conjunct form of con-sonants except in the case of aspiration.
In Urdu,aspiration of a consonant is marked with the spe-cial character Heh-Doachashmee (?)
(Malik etal., 2008), thus a finite-state transducer can easi-ly decide about the conjunction for aspirationwith a simple contextual rule, e.g.
the word ?????
(bride) [d?
?lhn] is correctly transliterated by ourfinite-state transliteration model into ?????
?.2.4 Native Hindi Spellings and SanskritizedVocabularySanskrit highly influences Hindi and especiallyits vocabulary.
In some words of Sanskrit origin,the vowel ??
[i] and ??
[u] are transcribed as ??[?]
and ??
[?]
respectively at the end of a word.Javaid and Ahmed (2009) have pointed to thisissue in these words ?Hindi language can havewords that end on short vowel??.
Table 4 givessome examples of such native words.
On theother hand in Urdu, short vowels can never comeat the end of a word (Javaid and Ahmed, 2009;Malik et al, 2008).Vowel Examples??
[i]???????
?
?????
(person) [vj?kti]???????
?
???????
(culture) [s??skr?t?i]????????
?
???????
(high) [???ko?i]??
[u]????
?
?????
(for) [het?u]?????
??
?????
(but) [k?nt?u]????
?
??????
(metal) [d?
?t?u]Table 4: Hindi Word with Short vowel at EndIt is clear from above examples that short vowelsat the end of a Hindi word can easily be translite-rated in Urdu using a contextual rule of a finite-state transducer, but it is not possible to do so forUrdu to Hindi transliteration using a non-probabilistic finite-state transliteration model.Thus Urdu to Hindi transliteration can also be179considered as a special case of Back Translitera-tion.In some words, the vowel ??
[u] is written asthe vowel ??
[?
], e.g., ???
?
?????
or ???
?
????
(to be)[hue], ???????
(name of a city) [r??
?npur].Some of these cases are regular and can be im-plemented as contextual rules in a finite-statetransducer but it is not possible in every case.2.5 Ain (?
)Ain (?
?
glottal stop) exists in the Arabic alpha-bet and native Arabic speakers pronounce itproperly.
Urdu also has adopted Ain (?)
in itsalphabet as well as Arabic loan words but nativespeakers of the sub-continent cannot produce itssound properly, rather they produce a vowelsound by replacing Ain (?)
with Alef (?).
TheHindi alphabet follows one character for onesound rule and it does not have any equivalent ofAin (?).
Then, Ain (?)
in Urdu words is tran-scribed in Hindi by some vowel representing thepronunciation of the word by native sub-continent speakers.
Thus it is always translite-rated in some vowel in Hindi.
For example, Ain(?)
gives the sound of the vowel [?]
in ????
?????
(strange) [?
?ib] and the vowel [?]
withand without Alef (?)
in words ???
?
??
(com-mon) [?m] and ???
?
???
(after) [b?d?]
respective-ly.
In some words, Ain (?)
is not pronounced atall and should be deleted while transliteratingfrom Urdu to Hindi, e.g., ??????
?
????
(to start)[?
?ru], etc.
Conversion of Ain (?)
is a big prob-lem for transliteration.2.6 NasalizationNoonghunna (?)
[?]
is the nasalization marker ofvowels in Urdu.
Interestingly, it is only used tonasalize a vowel at the end of a word.
In themiddle of a word, Noon (?)
[n] is used to markthe nasalization of a vowel and it is also used asa consonant.
It is difficult to differentiate be-tween nasalized and consonant Noon (?).
Thereare certain contextual rules that help to decidethat Noon (?)
is used as a consonant or a nasali-zation marker, but it not possible in all cases.2.7 Persio-Arabic VocabularyUrdu borrows a considerable portion of it voca-bulary from Persian and Arabic and translitera-tion of these words in Hindi is not regular.
Table5 explains it with few examples.UrduHindiFST Conversion Correct????????????(surely)??????[b?lk?l]????????????????

[f?lh?qiq?t]Table 5: Persio-Arabic Vocabulary in Urdu3 Hybrid Transliteration ModelThe analysis of the previous section clearlyshows that solution of these problems is beyondthe scope of the non-probabilistic Hindi UrduFinite-state transliteration model (Malik et al,2008).
We propose a hybrid transliteration modelthat takes the input Urdu text and converts it inHindi using the Finite-state Transliteration Mod-el (Malik et al 2008).
After that, it tries to cor-rect the orthographic errors in the transducer-only Hindi output string using a statistical wordlanguage model for Hindi with the help of aHindi Word Map described later.
The approachused is rather similar to what is done in text re-capitalization (Stolcke et al 1998) for instance.Figure 2: Hybrid Transliteration Model for UrduHindiNormally, the Urdu text does not contain neces-sary diacritical marks that are mandatory for thecorrect transliteration by the finite-state compo-nent Urdu Hindi Transliteration180Finite-state Machine (UHT-FSM),described by Malik et al (2008).
The proposedhybrid model focuses on the correct translitera-tion of Urdu texts without diacritical marks.
Fig-ure 2 gives the proposed Model architecture.3.1 Preprocessing UHT-FSM OutputThe goal of this pre-processing is to generate amore ?normalized?
(and consequently more am-biguous) form of Hindi, e.g.
pre-processingtransforms both corpus words ??
(this) [?s] and??
(that) [?s] (if encountered in the UHT-FSMHindi output) into the default input Hindi word??
* [?s] (not a valid Hindi word but is a finite-state transliteration of the input Urdu word ?
?, aword without diacritical marks).
Thus pre-processing is vital for establishing connectionsbetween the UHT-FSM Hindi output words(from the Urdu input without diacritical marks)and the Hindi corpus words.
In the exampleabove, the word ??
* [?s] is aligned to two Hin-di corpus words.
All such alignments are record-ed in the Hindi Word Map.
This ambiguity willbe solved by the Hindi word languagemodel, trained on a large amount of Hindi data.Thus pre-processing is a process that establishesconnections between the most likely expectedinput Hindi word forms (UHT-FSM Hindi outputfrom the Urdu input without diacritical marks)and the correct Hindi word forms (words that arepresent in the Hindi corpus).The Preprocessing component is a finite-state transducer that normalizes the Hindi outputof UHT-FSM component for the Hindi wordlanguage model.
The transducer converts allcases of gemination of consonants into a simpleconsonant.
For example, the UHT-FSM convertsthe Urdu word ???
(God) [r?bb] into ????
and thePreprocessing converts it into ??
[rb].
Thetransducer also removes the conjunct marker (??
)from the output of the UHT-FSM except when itis preceded by one of the consonant from the set{?
[r], ?
[l], ?
[m], ?
[n]} and also followed bythe consonant ?
[h] (first 3 lines of Figure 3),e.g., UHT-FSM converts the Urdu words ??????
(Hindi) [h?ndi] and ?????
(bride) [d?
?lhn] into ?????
?and ??????
respectively and the Preprocess-ing component converts them into ?????
(re-moves ??)
and ??????
(no change).
Actually, Pre-processing deteriorates the accuracy of the outputof the UHT-FSM component.
We will come backto this point with exact figures in the next sec-tion.The code of the finite-state transducer is givenin XFST (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) style inFigure 3.
In XFST, the rules are applied in re-verse order due to XFST?s transducer stack, i.e.
arule written at the end of the XFST script filewill apply first and so on.read regex [?

];Figure 3: Preprocessing Transducer3.2 Hindi Word Language ModelThe Hindi Word Language Model is animportant component of the hybrid transliterationmodel.
For the development of our statisticalword language model, we have used the HindiCorpus freely available from the Center for In-dian Language Technology1, Indian Institute ofTechnology Bombay (IITB), India.First, we extracted all Hindi sentences fromthe Hindi corpus.
Then we removed all punctua-tion marks from each sentence.
Finally, we add-ed ?<s>?
and ?</s>?
tags at the start and at theend of each sentence.
We trained a tri-gramHindi Word Language Model with theSRILM (Stolcke, 2002) tool.
The processed Hin-di corpus data contains total 173,087 unique sen-1 http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/181tences and more than 3.5 million words.
TheSRILM toolkit command ?disambig?
is used togenerate the final Hindi output using the statis-tical word language model for Hindi and theHindi Word Map described in the next section.3.3 Hindi Word MapThe Hindi Word Map is another very importantcomponent of the proposed hybrid transliterationmodel.
It describes how each ?normalized?
Hindiword that can be seen after the Preprocess-ing step and can be converted to one or severalcorrect Hindi words, the final decision beingmade by the statistical word language model forHindi.
We have developed it from the sameprocessed Hindi corpus data that was used tobuild the Hindi Word Language Model.We extracted all unique Hindi words (120,538unique words in total).The hybrid transliteration model is an effort tocorrectly transliterate the input Urdu text withoutdiacritical marks in Hindi.
Thus we take eachunique Hindi word and try to generate all possi-ble Hindi word options that can be given as inputto the Hindi Word Language Modelcomponent for the said word.
Consider the Urduword ???
(God) [r?bb]; its correct Hindi spel-lings are ????.
If we remove the diacritical markShadda (H?)
after the last character of the word,then the word becomes ??
and UHT-FSM trans-literates it in ??*.
Thus the Hindi WordLanguage Model will encounter either ????
or??
* for the Hindi word ????
(two possible wordoptions).
In other words, the Hindi Word Map isa computational model that records all possiblealignments between the ?normalized?
or pre-processed words (most likely input word forms)and the correct Hindi words from the corpus.We have applied a finite-state transducer thatgenerates all possible word options for eachunique Hindi word.
We cannot give the fullXFST code of the ?Default Input Creator?
due tospace shortage, but a sample XFST code is givenin Figure 4.
If the Urdu input contains all neces-sary diacritical marks, then pre-processing of theoutput of the UHT-FSM tries to remove the effectof some of these diacritical marks from the Hindioutput.
In the next section, we will show thatactually it increases the accuracy at the end.define CONSONANTS [?

?Figure 5: Sample Hindi Word Map4 Test and ResultsFor testing purposes, we extracted 200 Hindisentences from the Hindi corpus before removingpunctuation marks.
These sentences were ofcourse removed from the training corpus used tobuild the statistical word language model forHindi.
First we converted these 200 Hindi sen-tences in Urdu using Hindi Urdu Finite-statetransliteration model (Malik et al, 2008).
Trans-182literated Urdu sentences were post edited ma-nually for any error and we also made sure thatthe Urdu text contained all diacritical marks.
200original Hindi sentences served as Hindi refer-ence for evaluation purposes.From the post-edited Urdu sentences, we de-veloped two test corpora.
The first test corpuswas the Urdu test with all diacritical marks.
Inthe second test corpus, all diacritical marks wereremoved.
We calculated both word level andcharacter level accuracy and error rates using theSCLITE 2  tool.
Our 200 sentence test contains4,250 words and 16,677 characters in total.4.1 Test: UHT-FSMFirst we converted both Urdu test data usingUHT-FSM only and compared the transliteratedHindi texts with the Hindi reference.
UHT-FSMshows a word error rate of 21.5% and 51.5% forthe Urdu test data with and without diacriticsrespectively.
Results are given in Table 6, row 1.Urdu Test Data With diacriticsWithoutdiacriticsUHT-FSMAccuracy/Error80.7% /21.5%50.7% /51.5%UHT-FSM +HLM82.6% /19.6%79.1% /23.1%UHT-FSM +PrePro67.5% /32.4%50.7% /51.5%UHT-FSM +PrePro + HLM85.8% /16.4%79.1% /23.1%Table 6: Word Level ResultsThese results support our claims that the absenceof diacritical marks considerably increases theerror rate.4.2 Test: UHT-FSM + Hindi LanguageModelBoth outputs of UHT-FSM are first passed direct-ly to Hindi Word Language Model with-out preprocessing.
The Hindi Word Lan-guage Model converts UHT-FSM Hindi out-put in the final Hindi output with the help ofHindi Word Map.Two final outputs were again compared withthe Hindi reference and results are given in Table6, row 2.
For Urdu test data without diacritics,error rate decreased by 28.4% due to the HindiWord Language Model and Hindi Word2 http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tools/Map as compared to the UHT-FSM error rate.The Hindi Word Language Model also decreasesthe error rate by 1.9% for the Urdu test data withdiacritics.4.3 Test: UHT-FSM + PreprocessingIn this test, both outputs of UHT-FSM were pre-processed and the intermediate Hindi outputswere compared with the Hindi reference.
Resultsare given in Table 6, row 3.
After the comparisonof results of row 1 and row 3, it is clear that pre-processing deteriorates the accuracy of Urdu testdata with diacritics and does not have any effecton Urdu test data without diacritics.4.4 Test: UHT-FSM + Preprocessing +Hindi Language ModelPreprocessed UHT-FSM Hindi outputs of the testof Section 4.3 were passed to the Hindi WordLanguage Model that produced final Hindioutputs with the help of the Hindi Word Map.Results are given in Table 6, row 4.
They showthat the Hindi Word Language Modelincreases the accuracy by 5.1% and 18.3% whencompared with the accuracy of UHT-FSM andUHT-FSM + Preprocessing tests respectively, forthe Urdu test data with diacritical marks.For the Urdu test data without diacriticalmarks, the Hindi Word Language Modelincreases the accuracy rate by 28.3% in compari-son to the accuracy of the UHT-FSM output(whether pre-processed or not).4.5 Character Level ResultsAll outputs of tests of Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and4.4 and the Hindi reference are processed to cal-culate the character level accuracy and errorrates.

?Figure 7: ExamplesBy comparing Hindi outputs of Hindi WordLanguage Model with the Hindi reference,only the first word of (2)(ii) is wrong and othererrors due to the absence of diacritical marks inthe source Urdu sentences are corrected properly.5 ConclusionFrom the test results of the previous section wecan conclude that the statistical word languagemodel increases the accuracy of Urdu to Hinditransliteration, especially for Urdu input textwithout diacritical marks.
The proposed HybridTransliteration Model improves the accuracy andproduces the correct Hindi output even when thecrucial information in the form of diacriticalmarks is absent.
It increases the accuracy by28.3% in comparison to our previous Finite-stateTransliteration Model.
This study also shows thatdiacritical marks are crucial and necessary forHindi Urdu transliteration.ReferencesBeesley, Kenneth R. and Karttunen, Lauri.
