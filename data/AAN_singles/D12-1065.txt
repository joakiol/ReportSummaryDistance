Asin clustering and topic modeling, our goalis to provide an organizing perspective intootherwise overwhelming amounts of infor-mation.
We are particularly interested inrevealing and exploiting relationships be-tween documents.
To this end, we focus onextracting diverse sets of threads?singly-linked, coherent chains of important doc-uments.
To illustrate, we extract researchthreads from citation graphs and constructtimelines from news articles.
Our methodis highly scalable, running on a corpus ofover 30 million words in about four minutes,more than 75 times faster than a dynamictopic model.
Finally, the results from ourmodel more closely resemble human newssummaries according to several metrics andare also preferred by human judges.1 IntroductionThe increasing availability of large documentcollections has the potential to revolutionizeour ability to understand the world.
However,the scale and complexity of such collections fre-quently make it difficult to quickly grasp theimportant details and the relationships betweenthem.
As a result, automatic interfaces for datanavigation, exploration, aggregation, and analy-sis are becoming increasingly valuable.In this work we propose a novel approach:threading structured document collections.
Con-sider a large graph, with documents as nodesand edges indicating relationships, as in Figure 1.Our goal is to find a diverse set of paths (orthreads) through the collection that are indi-vidually coherent and together cover the mostsalient parts.
For example, given a collectionof academic papers, we might want to identifythe most significant lines of research, threadingthe citation graph to produce chains of impor-tant papers.
Or, given news articles connectedchronologically, we might want to extract threadsof articles to form timelines describing the ma-jor events from the most significant news stories.Top-tier news organizations like The New YorkTimes and The Guardian regularly publish suchtimelines, but have so far been limited to creat-ing them by hand.
Other possibile applicationsmight include discovering trends on social mediasites, or perhaps mining blog entries for impor-tant conversations through trackback links.
Weshow how these kinds of threading tasks can bedone efficiently, providing a simple, practical toolfor representing graph-based data that offers newpossibilities compared with existing models.The Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) pro-gram (Wayne, 2000) has recently led to someresearch in this direction.
Several of TDT?s coretasks, like link detection, topic detection, andtopic tracking, can be seen as subroutines forthe threading problem.
Our work, however, ad-dresses these tasks jointly, using a global prob-abilistic model with a tractable inference algo-rithm.
To achieve this, we employ structureddeterminantal point processes (SDPPs) (Kulesza710Figure 1: An illustration of document collection threading.
We first build a graph from the collection, usingmeasures of importance and relatedness to weight nodes (documents) and build edges (relationships).
Then,from this graph, we extract a diverse, salient set of threads to represent the collection.
The supplementcontains a version of this figure for our real-world news dataset.and Taskar, 2010), which offer a natural prob-abilistic model over sets of structures (such asthreads) where diversity is desired, and we incor-porate k-DPP extensions to control the numberof threads (Kulesza and Taskar, 2011).We apply our model to two real-world datasets,extracting threads of research papers and time-lines of news articles.
An example of newsthreads extracted using our model is shown inFigure 2.
Quantitative evaluation shows that ourmodel significantly outperforms multiple base-lines, including dynamic topic models, in com-parisons with human-produced news summaries.It also outperforms baseline methods in a userevaluation of thread coherence, and runs 75 timesfaster than a dynamic topic model.The primary contributions of this paperare: (1) proposing a novel framework for findingdiverse and salient sets of document threads; (2)combining SDPPs and k-DPPs to implement theproposed model; (3) introducing random projec-tions to improve efficiency with only boundeddeviation; and (4) demonstrating the model onlarge-scale, real-world datasets.2 Related WorkA variety of papers from the topic tracking liter-ature are broadly related to our work (Mei andZhai, 2005; Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Leskovec etal., 2009; Ahmed and Xing, 2010).
Blei and Laf-ferty (2006) recently introduced dynamic topicmodels (DTMs).
Assuming a division of doc-uments into time slices, a DTM draws in eachslice a set of topics from a Gaussian distributionwhose mean is determined by the topics fromthe previous slice.
In this way, a DTM generatestopic threads.
In this work we are interested inthe related but not identical task of generatingdocument threads.
We engineer a baseline forconstructing document threads from DTM topicthreads (see Section 6.2.2), but the topic-centricnature of DTMs means they are not ideal forthis task.
Figure 2 illustrates some of the issues.The work of Ahmed and Xing (2010) general-izes DTMs to iDTMs (infinite DTMs) by allowingtopics to span only a subset of time slices, andallowing an arbitrary number of topics.
However,iDTMs still require placing documents into dis-crete epochs, and the issue of generating topicrather than document threads remains.
In Sec-tion 6 we compare to DTMs but not iDTMsbecause an implementation of iDTMs was notreadily available.In the information retrieval community therehas also been work on extracting temporal in-formation from document collections.
Swan andJensen (2000) proposed a system for finding tem-porally clustered named entities in news text andpresenting them on a timeline.
Allan, Gupta,and Khandelwal (2001) introduced the task oftemporal summarization, which takes a streamof news articles on a particular topic and tries toextract sentences describing important events asthey occur.
Yan et al011) evaluated methodsfor choosing sentences from temporally clustereddocuments that are relevant to a query.
Here, weare interested not in extracting topically groupedentities or sentences, but instead in organizing asubset of the articles themselves into timelines,with topic identification as a side effect.There has also been some prior work focus-ing more directly on threading.

Above, the threads are shown on a timeline with the most salient words superimposed;below, the dates and headlines from the threads appearing at the bottom are listed.
Topic models are notdesigned for threading and often link together topically similar documents that do not constitute a coherentnews story, as on the right.Guestrin (2010) and Chieu and Lee (2004) pro-posed selecting a single thread, whereas we seeka set of threads, which is a more general task.Shahaf, Guestrin, and Horvitz (2012) recentlyproposed metro maps as alternative structuredrepresentations of related news stories.
Metromaps are effectively sets of non-chronologicalthreads that are encouraged to intersect and thuscreate a ?map?
of events and topics.
However,these approaches assume some prior knowledgeabout content.
Shahaf and Guestrin (2010), forexample, assume the thread endpoints are spec-ified, and Chieu and Lee (2004) require a setof query words.
These inputs make it possibleto quickly pare down the document graph.
Inconstrast, we work with very large graphs andconsider all possible threads.
Furthermore, whilesome prior work has relied on heuristics and ap-proximate optimization, we can efficiently samplea joint probabilistic model with approximationguarantees.In previous work on SDPPs (structured DPPs),which we use here to model threads, Kulesza andTaskar (2010) derived exact polynomial-time al-gorithms for sampling and other inference.
How-ever, their experiments involved feature vectorsof only 32 dimensions.
For text, natural featureslike word occurrences typically yield dimension-ality in the tens of thousands, making SDPPinference prohibitively expensive.
We solve thisproblem by reducing the feature space using ran-dom projections (see Section 5).
We prove thateven a logarithmic number of projections is suffi-cient to yield a close approximation to the origi-nal SDPP distribution.3 FrameworkBefore presenting our probabilistic model, wedescribe a natural framework for representingdocument collections.
We assume that the collec-tion has been transformed into a directed graphG = (V,E) on n vertices, where each node cor-responds to a document and each edge repre-sents a relationship between documents whosesemantics depend on the task.
We also as-sume the existence of a weight function w onnodes and edges, which measures the impor-tance or salience of documents and the relativestrength of the relationships between them.
For-mally, we define the weight of a path (or thread)y = (y(1), y(2), .
.
.
, y(T )), (y(t), y(t+1)) ?
E by:w(y) =T?t=1w(y(t))+T?1?t=1w(y(t), y(t+1)).
(1)712Lastly, we also assume the existence of nodefeatures.
Specifically, let ?
represent a featuremapping from nodes to RD (for example, tf-idfword vectors).
The feature map on a thread isthen just a sum over the nodes in the thread:?
(y) =T?t=1?(y(t)).
(2)(If it is convenient to have features on edges aswell as on nodes, it is possible to accommodatethem without affecting asymptotic performance.
)Given this framework, our goal is to developa probabilistic model over sets of k threads oflength T , favoring sets whose threads have largeweight but are also distinct from one another withrespect to ?.
In other words, a high-probabilityset under the model should include threads thatare both salient and diverse.This is a daunting problem, given that thenumber of possible sets of threads is O(nkT ).For the datasets we use later, the actual numberis around 21000.
However, we will show how toconstruct the desired model in a way that allowsefficient inference, even for large datasets, usingdeterminantal point processes (DPPs).
We beginwith some background.4 Determinantal point processesA DPP is a type of distribution over subsets.Formally, a DPP P on a set of items Y ={y1, .
.
.
, yN} is a probability measure on 2Y , theset of all subsets of Y .
(In our setting, Y will bethe set of all possible threads.)
For every Y ?
Ywe have:P(Y ) =det(LY )?Y?Ydet(LY )=det(LY )det(L+ I), (3)where L is a positive semidefinite matrix and Iis the N ?N identity matrix.
LY ?
[Lij ]yiyj?Ydenotes the restriction of L to the entries indexedby elements of Y , and det(L?)
= 1.
We candefine the entries of L as follows:Lij = q(yi)?(yi)>?
(yj)q(yj) , (4)where we can think of q(yi) ?
R+ as the ?qual-ity?
of an item yi, and ?

(b) As quality (length) increases, so does volume.
(c)As similarity increases, volume decreases.as a normalized D-dimensional feature vectorsuch that ?(yi)>?
(yj) ?
[?1, 1] is a measure ofsimilarity between items yi and yj .
This simpledefinition gives rise to a distribution that placesmost of its weight on sets that are both high qual-ity and diverse.
To understand why this is thecase, note that determinants are closely relatedto volumes; in particular, det(LY ) is proportionalto the volume spanned by the vectors q(yi)?
(yi)for yi ?
Y .
Thus, sets with high-quality, diverseitems have the highest probability; see Figure 3for an illustration.4.1 Structured DPPsKulesza and Taskar (2010) introduced structuredDPPs (SDPPs) to efficiently handle Y containingexponentially many structures.
In our setting, Ycontains all threads of length T , so each yi ?
Y isa sequence (y(1)i , .
.
.
, y(T )i ), where y(t)i is the docu-ment included in the thread at position t. WhenG is a complete graph, there are nT possiblesequences, so |Y| = N = nT .In order to allow for efficient normalizationand sampling, SDPPs assume a factorizationof the quality score q(yi) and similarity score?(yi)>?
(yj) into parts, decomposing quality mul-tiplicatively and similarity additively:q(yi) =T?t=1q(y(t)i)?
(yi) =T?t=1?
(y(t)i)(5)For threading, the definition of ?
is just as givenin Equation (2).
However, in order to convert theweight function defined in Equation (1) to the713appropriate multiplicative form, we use a sim-ple log-linear model, setting q(yi) = exp(?w(yi)),where ?
is a hyperparameter that effectively gov-erns the balance between quality and diversityby adjusting the dynamic range of the qualityfunction.An efficient algorithm for sampling structures(in this case, sets of threads) from an SDPP isderived in Kulesza and Taskar (2010).
Whilethe details are beyond the scope of this paper,we note that the sampling algorithm requiresO(Tn2D2) time.
If the node degrees are boundedby r then the time is reduced to O(TrnD2).
Thisis not quite efficient enough when the numberof features, D, is large, as it often is for textualtasks, but we will show in Section 5 how toovercome this last hurdle.Note that, in our later experiments, we fix Tto moderate values (T = 5, 8) for ease of analysisand display.
However, it is possible (and effi-cient, due to the linear scaling) to allow longerthreads, as well as threads of variable length.The latter effect can be achieved by adding a sin-gle ?dummy?
node to the document graph, withincoming edges from all other documents and asingle outgoing self-loop edge.
Shorter threadswill simply transition to this dummy node whenthey are complete.4.2 k-DPPsSDPPs allow us to efficiently model all sets ofthreads; however, for practical reasons we wouldprefer to focus only on sets of exactly k threads.To do so we exploit recently developed methodsfor working with DPPs of fixed size (Kuleszaand Taskar, 2011).
A k-DPP Pk is a DPP con-ditioned on the event that the subset Y ?
Y hascardinality k; formally, whenever |Y | = k:Pk(Y ) =det(LY )?|Y ?|=k det(LY ?).
(6)In this work we combine k-DPPs with SDPPs,referring to the result as a k-SDPP.
We note thatusing k-SDPPs instead of SDPPs does not affectefficiency of sampling; it merely affords a mecha-nism for controlling the number of threads.5 Random projectionsAs described above, the time complexity for sam-pling sets from SDPPs is O(TrnD2).
Althoughthis is polynomial, for practical problems nD2is prohibitively large.
While previous work hasdealt only with small datasets, in our experi-ments we typically have n,D > 30,000; storinga single message for the message-passing routineinvolved in SDPP sampling would require over200 terabytes of memory.
To make the modelpractical, therefore, we turn to techniques fordimensionality reduction.Standard PCA requires O(D3) time and wouldbe much too slow.
But a classic result of John-son and Lindenstrauss (1984) shows that high-dimensional points can be randomly projectedonto a logarithmic number of dimensions whileapproximately preserving the distances betweenthem.
More recently, Magen and Zouzias (2008)extended this idea to the preservation of volumesspanned by sets of points.
Here, we use a rela-tionship between determinants and volumes toadapt the latter result.
We will prove the follow-ing bound on the variational distance betweenthe original k-SDPP and a randomly projectedversion.Theorem 1.

Energy Efficient Query OptimizationFigure 5: Example threads sampled from a 4-SDPP with thread length T = 5 on the Cora dataset.
Weproject from word-space to two dimensions by running PCA on the centroids of the threads.
The nodes noton the thread paths form a representative subset of the other documents from Cora.
Displayed beside eachthread are a few of its maximum-tfidf words.
Paper titles from two of the threads are shown to the right.6 ExperimentsWe begin by showing the performance of randomprojections on a small, synthetic threading taskwhere the exact model is tractable, with n = 600and D = 150.
Figure 4 shows the L1 variationaldistance (estimated by sampling) as well as theactual memory required for a variety of projec-tion dimensions d. Note that, as predicted byTheorem 1, fidelity to the true model increasesrapidly with d.6.1 Cora citation graphTo qualitatively illustrate our model, we applyit to Cora (McCallum et al2000).
Cora is alarge collection of academic papers on computerscience topics, plus citations between them.
Weconstruct a directed graph with papers as nodesand citations as edges; after removing paperswith missing metadata or zero outgoing citations,our graph contains n = 28,155 papers.To obtain useful threads, we set edge weightsto reflect the degree of textual similarity betweenthe citing and cited papers, and set node weightsto reflect paper ?importance?.
Edge weightsare given by normalized cosine similarity (NCS),which for two documents i and j is the dot prod-uct of their normalized tfidf vectors:?w?W tfidfi(w)tfidfj(w)?
?w?W tfidfi(w)2?
?w?W tfidfj(w)2,where W is a subset of the words found in thedocuments.
We select W by filtering accordingto document frequency; that is, we remove wordsthat are too common or too rare.
After filtering,there are 50,912 unique words.
The node weightsare given by LexRank scores (Erkan and Radev,2004), which are similar to node degrees.Finally, we build a similarity feature map ?
toencourage diversity.
We represent each documentby the 1000 documents to which it is most similaraccording to NCS; this results in binary ?
ofdimension m = n with exactly 1000 non-zeros.The dot product between the similarity featuresof two documents is thus proportional to thefraction of top-1000 similar documents they havein common.
As described in Section 5, we thenrandomly project this large feature set from D ?28,000 to d = 50 dimensions.We illustrate the behavior of the resultingmodel in Figure 5.
The discovered threads oc-cupy distinct regions of word-space, standingapart visually, and contain diverse salient terms.6.2 News articlesFor quantitative evaluation, we use newswiredata.
Our dataset comprises over 200,000 arti-cles from the New York Times, collected from2005-2007 as part of the English Gigaword cor-pus (Graff and Cieri, 2009).
We split the articlesinto six-month time periods, with an average of716n = 34,504 articles per period.
After filtering,there are a total of 36,356 unique words.For each time period, we generate a graph witharticles as nodes.
We use NCS for edge weights,and throw away edges with weight < 0.1.
Wealso require that edges go forward in time; thisenforces the chronological ordering of our threads.The supplement contains illustrations of one ofthe resulting graphs.
We use LexRank for nodeweights and the top-1000 similar documents assimilarity features ?, projecting to d = 50, asbefore (Section 6.1).
We also add a constant fea-ture ?
to ?, which controls the overall degree ofrepulsion; large values of ?
make all documentsmore similar.
This makes the k-SDPP distri-bution more peaked around diverse sets.
Forall of the following results, we use T = 8 andk = 10 so that the resulting timelines are of amanageable size for analysis.
However, we triedseveral values of k and T in our experiments, anddid not see significant differences in relative per-formance.
We report all metrics averaged over100 random samples from the model for eachsix-month period.6.2.1 Graph visualizationsThe (very large) news graph for the firsthalf of 2005 can be viewed interactively athttp://zoom.it/jOKV.
In this graph each node(dark circle) represents a news article, and is an-notated with its headline.
Node size correspondsto weight (LexRank score).
Nodes are laid outchronologically, left-to-right, from January toJune of 2005.
The five colored paths indicate aset of threads sampled from the k-SDPP.
Head-lines of the articles in each thread are coloredto match the thread.
Edges are included as de-scribed in the paper, but due to the scale of thisdataset, only 1% of the edges are shown.
Edgethickness corresponds to weight (NCS).We provide a view of a small subgraph forillustration purposes in Figure 6, which showsthe incoming and outgoing edges for a singlenode.

Seehttp://zoom.it/GUCR for the zoomable image.6.2.2 Baselinesk-means baseline: A simple baseline is tosplit each six-month period of articles into Tequal time slices, then apply k-means clusteringto each slice, using NCS to measure distance.We then select the most central article from eachcluster, and finally match the k articles fromtime slice i one-to-one with those from slice i+ 1by computing the pairing that maximizes theaverage NCS of the pairs, i.e., the coherence ofthe threads.
The result is a set of k threadsof length T , where no two threads contain thesame article.
In its use of clustering, this base-line is somewhat similar to the ?event threading?baseline of Shahaf and Guestrin (2010).DTM baseline: A more sophisticated base-line is the dynamic topic model (Blei and Lafferty,2006), which explicitly attempts to find topicsthat are smooth through time.
We use codeprovided by the authors to fit DTMs with thenumber of topics set to k and with the data splitinto T equal slices, as before.
We then choose,for each topic at each time step, the documentwith the highest per-word probability of beinggenerated by that topic.
Documents from thesame topic form a single thread.717CosSimROUGE-1 ROUGE-2 ROUGE-SU4F Prec/ Rec F Prec / Rec F Prec/ Reck-means 29.9 16.5 17.3/15.8 0.695 0.725 / 0.669 3.76 3.94/3.60DTM 27.0 14.7 15.5/14.0 0.750 0.813 / 0.698 3.44 3.63/3.28k-SDPP 33.2 17.2 17.7/16.7 0.892 0.917/0.870 3.98 4.11/3.87Table 1: Similarity of automatically generated timelines to human summaries.
Bold entries are significantlyhigher than others in the column at 99% confidence, computed using bootstrapping (Hesterberg et al2003).6.2.3 Comparison to human summariesWe compare the threads generated by ourbaselines and sampled from the k-SDPP to aset of human-generated news summaries.
Thehuman summaries are not threaded; they areflat, roughly daily news summaries published byAgence France-Presse and found in the Gigawordcorpus, distinguished by their ?multi?
type tag.A sample summary is included in the supplement.These summaries tend to focus on world news,which is only a subset of the contents of ourdataset.
However, they allow us to provide anextrinsic evaluation of our method without goldstandard timelines.
We compute four statistics:?
Cosine similarity: NCS (in percent) be-tween the concatenated threads and con-catenated human summaries.
The hyper-parameters for all methods?such as theconstant feature magnitude ?
for k-SDPPsand the parameter governing topic propor-tions for DTMs?were tuned to optimizecosine similarity on a development set fromJanuary-June 2005.?
ROUGE-1, 2, and SU4: StandardROUGE scores for summarization evalua-tion (Lin, 2004).Table 1 shows the results of these comparisons,averaged across all six half-year intervals.
Undereach measure, the k-SDPP threads more closelyresemble human summaries.6.2.4 Mechanical Turk evaluationAn important distinction between the base-lines and the k-SDPP is that the former aretopic-oriented, choosing articles that relate tobroad subject areas, while our approach is story-oriented, chaining together articles with directRating Interlopersk-means 2.73 0.71DTM 3.19 1.10k-SDPP 3.31 1.15Table 2: Rating: average coherence score from 1(worst) to 5 (best).

Bold entriesare significantly higher with 95% confidence.individual relationships.
An example of this dis-tinction can be seen in Figure 2.To obtain a large-scale evaluation of thread co-herence, we turn to Mechanical Turk.
We askedTurkers to read the headlines and first few sen-tences of each article in a timeline and then ratethe overall narrative coherence of the timeline ona scale of 1 (?the articles are totally unrelated?
)to 5 (?the articles tell a single clear story?).
Fiveseparate Turkers rated each timeline; the averageratings are shown in Table 2.
Note that k-meansdoes particularly poorly in terms of coherencesince it has no way to ensure that clusters aresimilar between time slices.We also had Turkers evaluate threads implic-itly by performing a simple task.
We showedthem timelines into which two additional ?in-terloper?
articles selected at random had beeninserted, and asked them to remove the two ar-ticles that they thought should be removed to?improve the flow of the timeline?.
A screenshotof the task is provided in the supplement.
Intu-itively, the interlopers should be selected moreoften when the original timeline is coherent.
Theaverage number of interloper articles correctlyidentified is shown in Table 2.718Runtimek-means 625.63DTM 19,433.80k-SDPP 252.38Table 3: Time (in seconds) required to produce acomplete set of threads.
The test machine has eightIntel Xeon E5450 cores and 32GB of memory.6.2.5 RuntimesFinally, we report in Table 3 the time requiredto produce a complete set of threads for eachmethod.
This time includes clustering for k-means, model fitting for DTM and random pro-jections, computation of the covariance matrix,and sampling for k-SDPP.
We view the graphas an input (much like tfidf vectors for the base-lines), and so do not include its computation inthe runtime for the k-SDPP.
Constructing thegraph only requires an additional 160 secondsthough.6.3 AnalysisBelow we briefly summarize the main differencesbetween the k-SDPP and the baselines, and dis-cuss their significance.?
Neither baseline directly models the docu-ment threads themselves.
In contrast, thek-SDPP defines a probability distributionover all possible sets of document threads.This makes the k-SDPP a better choice forapplications where, for instance, the coher-ence of individual threads is important.?
While the baselines seek threads that coveror explain as much of the dataset as possible,k-SDPPs are better suited for tasks wherea balance between quality and diversity iskey, since its hyperparameters correspondto weights on these quantities.
With newstimelines, for example, we want not justtopical diversity but also a focus on themost important stories.?
Both baselines require input to be split intotime slices, whereas the k-SDPP does not;this flexibility allows the k-SDPP to putmultiple articles from a single time slice ina thread, or to build threads that span onlypart of the input period.?
While clustering and topic models rely onEM to approximately optimize their objec-tives, the k-SDPP comes with an exact,polynomial-time sampling algorithm.Revisiting Figure 2, we can see all of theseadvantages in action.
The k-SDPP producesmore consistent threads due to its use of graphinformation, while the DTM threads, thoughtopic-focused, are less coherent as a story.
Fur-thermore, DTM threads span the entire timeperiod, while our method selects threads cover-ing only relevant spans.
The quantitative resultsin this section underscore the empirical value ofthese characteristics.7 ConclusionWe introduced the novel problem of finding di-verse and salient threads in graphs of large doc-ument collections.
We developed a probabilisticapproach, combining SDPPs and k-SDPPs, andshowed how random projections make inferenceefficient and yield an approximate model withbounded variational distance to the original.
Wethen demonstrated that the method producesqualitatively reasonable results, and, relative toseveral baslines, reproduces human news sum-maries more faithfully, builds more coherent storythreads, and is significantly faster.
It would beinteresting to extend our model to structures be-yond linear chains to trees and other structures.8 AcknowledgementsThis material is based upon work supported un-der a National Science Foundation Graduate Re-search Fellowship and NSF award 0803256.References[Ahmed and Xing2010] A.
