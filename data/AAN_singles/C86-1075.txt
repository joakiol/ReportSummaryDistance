The paperdescr ibes  a so lu t ion  to th i s  problem wi th in  the theoret i ca lframework of  the Roset ta  machine t rans la t ion  sys t~n.Roset ta  i s  an exper imenta l  t rans \ ]  a t \ ]on  system which uses anin termediate  lard,mate and t rans la tes  between Dutch, Eng l i shand,  in  the fu ture ,  Span ish .I ~nt roduet ionIdioms have been told still are a basic theoretical sttnlb-ling block in most linguistic theories.
For the purposes ofmachine translation or, in genera\], natural language pro-cessing, it is necessary to Ix~ able to deal with :idiomsbecause there are so i~any of th~n in every language andbecause they are an essential part of it.ldioms occur in sentences as a number of words, possiblyscattered over the sentence and possibly with sonde inflec-ted el~nents; this ntnfl~er of words has to be interpreted ashavip4~, one primitive meaning.
For example, in (1) "nade","peace" and "~.Rth" have to be interpreted idlomatically.Note that words that are part of the idJ~n are underlined.
(1) lie has made his peace with his neighbourThe classic example Is (2):(2) Pete kicked the bucketLiterally this sentence means that Pete hit a specificvessel ~?\[th his foot.
In the idiomatic reading the inter-pretation is that Pete died.
It is impossib\]e to infer thisidiomatic meaning directly fron the prlm~tives "Pete","kick", "the" and "bucket" and from the way they areeomblned.Idioms can undergo sy~itaetie transformations, but sometimesthey are reluctant to do so.
The passive sentence (3) haslost its idiomatic reading, while in the ~assive sentence(4) the idiomatic reading has heen retained .
(3) The bucket was kicked by Pete(4) Mary's heart was broken by PeteOther examples are (5-12).
In the idiomatic reading in (5)clefting with the object as focus is not allowed, while itis allowed in (6) if "Mary" is stressed.
Clefting with thesubject as focus in both (7) and (8) is permitted.
In (9)the PP "at whose door" and in (I0) the NP "whose heart" canbe subject to wh-movement.
In (ii) the NP "Mary's heart"can be topicallzed (if "Mary" is stressed), but in (1.2) tbeNP "the bucket" cannot undergo this transformation withoutlosing the idicanatic reading.
Thus idioms behave syntacti-cally like non-idiomatic structnres, although sometimesthey are restricted .
(5) It was the bucket that Pete Idcked(6) It was Mart's heart that Pete broke(7) It was Pete that kicked the bucket(8) It was Pete that broke Mary's heart "(9) At whose door did Pete lay his failure(i0) those heart did Pete say that Mary broke(ll) Mary's heart Pete broke(12) The bucket Pete IcicloedIdioms can take free arguments or can have elenents, llkepossess ive  pronotms,  which have to be hound hy arguments .In  sentences  (13-1.5) "Mary" \].s a complement o the id io -mat ic  verb, and realizes different grammatical functions inthe sentence (i.e.

In (16) the pronoun "his" has to Imbound by the subject "l?ete".

ingtdst i c  theor ies  on idioms should he ab le  to account  forthe prohibi ts  out \ ] \ ]ned  above.
The proposa ls  made are  usua l lyf ragmentary ,  ill the sense that  they  on ly  are  concerned withpar t  of  the prob l~n,  fo r  ins tance  F raser  (1970) ,  who on lydea ls  wi th  the poss ib le  app l i ca t ion  of  t rans fo~vaat ions  toid ioms,  or they are  a re la t ive ly  minor par t  of  a la rgertheory ,  for example Chomsky (1981.
), who g ives  a verygenera l  and pr fne ip led  account  of  id ioms,  Nit cannot  copewi th  a l l  the data .
More e laborate  s tud ies  on idioms areusually not directly relevant to machine translation, forinstance Boisset (1978), who treats idioms frc~n a morepragm~qtic lYoint of view.
To illustrate it could be arguedthat Chomsky (1981) can cope with sentences such as (2) and(15), but not wtt:h (13), (1.4) and (16); Pesetsky (1985) candeal with (2) or (13-16), hut not with a sentence lilm:(17) Pete lald his failure a:t Mary's d_oo ~Chonsky (198\[, p. 146, note 94) claims that "we may thinkof an idiom rule for an idiom with a verbal head as a ruleadding the string aVc to the phrase marker of each terminalstring abc, ~dmre b is the idiom, now understanding aphrase marker to be a set of strings" and that idioms"appear either :In D-structure or S-strncture or LF-form.
"Furthermore "at: D-structure, idioms can be distinguished assubject or not snhject to Move alpha".Thus here it is possible to reanalyse a string abe ~nto aVcas for example for sentence (2) in figure (18), where thereanalysis is indicated by a double tree and where a is"Pete", b is "kick the bucket" and c is empty:(1.8) sNP VPPetekickf /VI t  seams that  on th i s  approach  ele~tents of  idioms must bead jacent  a t  a cer ta in  leve l  (D-s t ructure ,  S -s t ructure  orLF - form) ,  which i s  the  case  fo r  sentence  (2) .
ttowever, insentence  (14) the  par ts  of  the idiom "breok"  and "hear t "a re  not  ad jacent  a t  any leve l ,  s ince  the f ree  argument"Mary" i s  s i tuated  between the idiom par ts  and in  (16)" lose"  and "temper"  are  not: ad jacent  a t  any leve l  e i ther .IIence this theory is not able to deal with every type ofidiom.319According to Pesetsky (1985) in a configuration such asfigure (19) B and E may undergo a rule of idiosyncraticinterpretation, if E is the head of C.(19) AB CD EFor sentence (14) in which "heart" is the head of the NPdominating '~ury's heart", the Me of idtosyncratie Inter-pretation is allowed, resulting in:(20) SNP VPPeteV NPbreak~ ~i Np N; ~ heart: Mary's " 'VIn the above tree, the effect of the rule of idiosyncraticinterpretation is indicated by the dotted lines; the effectis that the idiom parts are mapped onto one meaning.As snggested by Pesetsky, this would also account forsentence (13) if we follow F~yne (1982) in his analysis ofdouble object constructions.
Kayne claims that "NP thefinger" forms a constituent with "the finger" as its head,so the rule of idiosyncratic interpretation is allowed.Sentences (17) and (21-22) are problematic even under thisanalysis:(21) Pete rammed his lack of money down Mary's throat(22) Pete gave Mary credit for her workFigure (23) gives a representation of sentence (21) inwhich "his lack of money" and "Mary" are free arguments:(23) SPetehis lack of money P NPdown ~NP NthroatMary'sSince "throat" and "down" are heads of their constituents,one might suggest a successive application of the rule ofidiosyncratic interpretation, but it is not clear how sucha rule should operate and since every constituent has ahead and syntactic categories are no barrier to ruleapplication, the domain in which this rule is permitted isunlimited.It seems that Chomsky (1981) and Pesetsky (1985) are notcapable of dealing with the counter examples given here.The treatment of idioms presented in this paper can copewith these phenomena because it is based on the asst~nptionthat elements of idioms neither have to be adjacent at thelevel of interpretation nor do they have to be in the320specific configuration proposed by Pesetsky.In the field of compntational linguistics not much atten-tion has been paid to idioms.
Some examples are Rothkegel(1973) and Wehrli (1984).
However, in their proposalsidioms are treated in the lexicon or morphology and thereis no apparent way to account for the scattering ofelements of idioms in sentences.The organisation of the rest of the paper is as follows: insection (2) an outline of the theoretical framework of t|~Rosetta machine translation system will be given; section(3) discusses idioms within this frmuework; section (4)discusses some of the typical problems mentioned in theintroduction.2 Outline of Isomorphic M-GrammarsThe Rosetta system is based on the "isomorphic grammar"approach to machine translation.
In this approach a sen-tence s" is considered a possible translation of a sentences if s and s" have not only the same meaning but if theyalso have similar derivational histories, which impliesthat their meanings are derived in the same way from thesame basic meanings.
This approach requires that "iso-morphic grammars" are written for the languages underconsideration.The term "possible translation" should be interpreted as"possible in a particular context".
The discussion in thispaper will be restricted to the translation of isolatedsentences on the basis of linguistic knowledge only.In the following sections the notions M-gremmars, thevariant of Montague grammar used in the Rosetta system, andisomorphic grammars will be introduced.
For a more detaileddiscussion of isomorphic M-grammars the reader is referredto Landshergen (1982, 1984).
In section (2.3) an example ofan M-grammar will be given.2.1 M-Gray, mrsThe grammars used in the system, called M-grammars, can beseen as a computationally viable variant of MontagueGrammar which is in accordance with the transformationalextensions proposed by Partee (1973).
This implies that thesyntactic rules operate on syntactic trees rather than onstrings.
Restrictions have been imposed on the grammars insuch a way that effective parsing procedures are possible.An M-grammar consists of (i) a syntactic, (ii) a morphol-ogical and (iii) a semantic component.
(i) The syntactic component of an M-grammar defines a setof "S-trees".An "S-tree" is a labelled ordered tree.
The labels of thenodes consist of a syntactic category and a list ofattribute-value pairs.
The branches are labelled with thenames of syntactic relations, such as subject, head,object, etc.An M-grammar defi~es a set of S-trees by specifying a setof basic S-trees and a set of syntactic rules called"M-Rule s".An "M-Rule" defines a partial function from tuples ofS-trees to S-trees.Starting from basic expressions, an expression can beformed by applying syntactic rules.
The result of this is asurface tree, in which the labels of the terminal nodescorrespond to words.
This process of making an expressionis represented in an M-grammar by a "syntactic derivationtree', in which the basic expressions are labels of theterminal nodes and the names of the rules that areapplicable are labels of the non-terminal nodes.
In theexample below (Fig.
(25)), rule R I makes the NP "the cat"from the 'basic expression "cat" and rule R 2 makes theS-tree for the sentence (24) on the basis of the NP and thebasic expression "walk" (the constructions to the left ofthe dotted llrms are abbreviations of ~lat the result ofthe application of the rule looks like).

This conu~nent will be ignor~l in the rest ofthe discussion.In this way the syntactic and the n~rphological componentdefine sentences.
(iii) The sem~mtic c~nponent.
M-grammars obey the composi-tionality principle, i.e.
every syntactic rule and everybasic S-tree gets a model-theoretical interpretation.
Fortranslation purposes only the names of meanings and thenames of meaning rules are relevant as ~il\] be shown later.The model-theoretical interpretation of the basic S-treesand the synt~tic  m*les is represented in a "s~lanticderivation tree", which has the same ~eo~l~try as thesyntactic derivation tree, hut is labelled with naales ofmeanings of r~es  and basic expressions.
An example isgiven below in (27).Before giving an example of an M-gramnmr in section (2.3),isomorphic M-grm~mars will be discussed.2.2 Isomorphic M-GrammarsTo establish the possible translation relation the gramnarsmust be attuned to each other as follows:- For each basic express:ion of a gr~maar G of a language Lthere is at least one basic expression of a grammar G" of alanguage L" with the same meaning.- For each syntactic rule of G there is at least onesyntactic rile of G ~ corresponding to the sane meaningoperation.
Syntactically these roles nmy differ consider-ably.Two sentences are defined to be (possible) translations ofeach other if they have derivation trees with the sm~egeometry, in which the corresponding nodes are labelledwith names of corresponding rt~es and basic expressions.
Ifthis is the case then the derivation trees are isomorphicand the two sentences have the same semantic derivationtree.Grammars that correspond to each other in the way describedabove will be called "isomorphic grammars" if the corre-sponding rules satisfy certain conditions on application,such that for each well-fonned syntactic derivation tree inone language there is at least one corresponding well-formed syntactic derivation tree in the other language.
Asyntactic derivation tree is well-formed if it defines asentence, ioe~ if the rules are applicable.The following is an illustration of these principles= X~eleft part of figure (27) shows the derivation tree ofsentence (26) which is the Dutch trm~slation of sentence(24).
Rule R~ h~ilds the NP "de kat" from the basicexpression "kat' and rule R" 2 constructs the expression "dekat loopt" from the NP and the basic expression "lopen".There is a correspondence between both the basic ex-pressions and the syntactic rules of the two granmars.
Eachrule of the syntactic derivation tree is mapped onto acorresponding rule of the s~ant ic  derivation tree and eachbasic expression is mapped onto the corresponding basicmeaning.

The semantic derivation treesare used as the interlingua.
The analysis cc~ponent trans-lates sentences into semantic derivation trees; the gener-ation component translates semantic derivation trees intotarget lang~mge sentences.
In this paper the translationrelation will ~ discussed generatively only.2.3 All Example  o f  an  M-Gr~mmmarIn this section an example will be given of an M-grammarthat generates sentence (28)i(28) Pete lends the glrl a bookOnly those M-Rules that are relevant to the discussion inthe following sections will be dealt with.
Note that therules given here are in an info~xaal notation.The M-gran~nar needed for this exanple:(i) basic S-trees:VERB(lend)(in this infomnal notation the syntactic information in thebasic S-trees, given in the focal of attribute-value pairs,has been omitted)NOUN(Pete)NOUN(girl)NOUN(book)VAR(xl) , VAR(x~),...(VAR'?

The rule substitutes an NP for the subjectvariable.
The same holds for rules R~ ~ and R~ , in whichthe NP's are substituted for the indif@.dt and d i~ct  objectrespectively.R6,j: if t I is of category NP andt 2 is of the form CL\[mul, iobj/VAR(xj), mu2\]then: CL\[mul, iobj/t I, mu2\]~ ,k :  if t I is of category NP andt 2 is of the fon1~ CL\[mul, obj/VAR(x,.

However, the semantic concept basicexpression does not always coincide with what one wouldcall a syntactic primitive.
This is the case, for instance,with idioms.
For exmnple the idiom "kick the bucket" hasthe primitive meaning "die', but the syntactic primitivesare "kick", "the" and "bucket".322For reasons given in the introduction it is impossible totreat idioms as strings (i.e.
syntactic primitives)?
Thepossibility of applying syntactic transformations to (el-oments of) idioms, which are also applicable to non-idio-matic constructs, suggests that idi~l~s should be treated ashaving complex constituent structures, which are similar tonon-ldiomatic constituent structures.
The possibility ofhaving free arguments, which are realized by variousgrammatical functions, suggests that parts of idioms do nothave to be adjacent at any level of the syntactic process.The complex idiomatic constituent structure should accommo-date this.In Rosetta, before idioms were introduced, basic ex-pressions were terminal S-trees, i.e.
tenminal nodes.Idioms can be treated as basic S-trees that have aninternal structure.
This type of expression is an exampleof what will be called a "comp\]ex basic expression" (CBE).A CBE is a basic expression from a semantic point of view,i.e.
it correspands to a basic meaning, and a complexexpression from a syntactic point of view, i.e.
it is anon-terminal S-tree.
For exmnple, the basic S~tree for"kick the bucket" looks like the following:(30) VERBVAN VERBV 1 "kick" det /~hea d/ xART NOUN"the" "bucket"By extending the notion of basic expression in this way theattuning of grammars (as defined in section (2.2)) iseasJer to achieve: corresponding basic expressions may beCBE's.
For ex~nple the D~itch verb "doodgaan" may correspondto the English idiom "kick the bucket".
Special measuresare necessary to guarantee that the rules obey the condi-tions on application (cf.
section (2.2)).Basic expressions are listed in the basic lexicon of agrammar.
A CBE is represented as a canonical surface treestructure in the lexicon.
A canonical surface tree struc-ture is the default tree structure for a certain sentence,phrase, etc., i.e.
the structure to which no syntactictransformations have applied.
For example: if there is apassive transformation, the canonical structure is in theactive form.
Figure (32) shows the lexicon representationof the idiom:(31) x I lend x 2 a hand(32) VERBsub J -.

not referring to anactual VAR) in the dictionary.
These variables will bereplaced by syntactic variables, when the CBE is insertedinto the syntactic tree, Apart from the category VERB andthe usual attribute-value pairs~ the top node contains aset of attribute-value pairs that indicates which trans=formations are possible.3.1 Treatment of Complex Basic ExpressionsIn this section an extension of the M-grammar of section(2.3) will be given that can deal with an interesting classof Complex Basic Expressions and t~o M-grarmnars will berelated to each other according to the isomorphy approach.Some other reasons for having complex basic expressionswill be given.3.1.1 An Example of an M-grmmmar for Complex BasicExpress ionsIn this section an M-graml~mr will be presented thatgenerates the idiomatic sentence:(33) Pete lends the girl a bandThe grmmnar of section (2.3) is extended in tile followingway:(i) basic S-treesVERB(V I lend V 2 a hand)(ii) M-Rules:R 9 : if t I is of the form VERB\[suhj/VI,head/~\]U~B, iob~/V~\] andt 2 i s  of category VAR with index~i andt 3 is of category VAR with index jtllen: CL \[ sub J/t2 , .
head/VERB,?
Lobj/t 3 \]This rule expects a complex, transitive verb and twovariables; it constructs a clause in which tile variablesare the subject and the indirect object.For this example the rules operate as follows:- R 9 renders CL(x i lend x. a hand),R 2 and R 3 as in section3(2.3),R5 i renders CL(Pete lend x. a hand),R6'.
gives CL(Pete lend theJgirl a hand),ru~ R 8 results in CL(Pete lends the girl a hand).The derivation tree for this sentence is represented in theleft part of figure (37).The resnlt of application of rules Rp, R2, R , R5.i and .

So the structures canhe idiomatic or non-idiomatic and other rules of tlleM-granmmr (e.g.
wh~novement or passiw\[sation) are appli-cable to both these structures, unless, as In tile case ofcertain idioms, they are prohibited as indicated at the topnode.3.1.2 Complex Basic Expressions and Isomorphic Grammar~Assume we have an M-grammar that generates the Dutchsentence (35) wldch is a translation of (33).
It is thenpossible to let the English M-grammar given above for (33)correspond to this grmnmar in the following way:(35) Pete helpt het meisje(36) R M 6 "R M R"R~ "3 /~ .~ 73 M4 73 /'k"Pete Vla .. V 2 B 1 B 2 Pete helpHere "Pete" in both languages corresponds to the basicmeaning B , "V lend V 2 a hand" and "help" to B , rules R 91 \ ] .
2and R" correspond to meaning rule MI, R 2 and R" 2 to M2, R 5and R'~ to M4, etc..In this ~ray it is possible to establish a correspondencebetween complex basic expressions in one language and basicexpressions that are not complex in another.
In a similarfashion it is possible to establish a relation betweencomplex basic expressions in one language and cc~nplex basicexpressions in another.
Note that in this way it is notnecessary to incorporate a so-e&lled structural transfer inthe machine translation syst~n for the translation ofCBE" s.3.2 Other Reasons for Waving Complex Basic ExpressionsExpressions that: are not idiomatic, but that consist ofmore than one word can be handled by means of a c~nplexbasic expression in order to retain the isomorphy.
This isthe case if the expression (i) corresponds to an idiom or(ii) corresponds to a word in another lmlguage.
Examplesare tlle follo~clng:(i) In l)utch (37) is not an idiom it* the sense definedabove (i.e.
the meaning of the expression "kwaad worden"can be composed in a natural way from "kwaad" and "wor-den"), but has an idiomatic equivalent in English (38).
(37) kwaad worden (Eng.
"become angry")(38) lose one's temperIf "kwaad worden" has to correspond to "lose one's temper",then in a technical sense, in Dutch, "kwaad worden" can betreated in the s~ne way as an idiom.
(ii) The Italian word (39) which translates into F.nglish(40) and Spanish (41) whieh translates into English (42)are words that correspond to complex expressions in English(and Dutch).
From a translational point of view cases like"get up early" can be treated in the same way as idioms.
(39) adagiare(40) lay down with care(4\]) madrugar(42) get up early4 Some Typical ProblemsIn this section sonle of the problems mentioned in theintroduction will he briefly discussed.4.1 Argument Var iables Embedded in a Complex Bas:\[cExpressionIn sentence (43) there are two arguments "Pete" arid "Mary"and the idiom "x. break x_'s heart".
The subject ("Pete") \[ z is treated in the same way as in the previous examples.
Theargument substitution 1"ele substitutes the variable by theNP "Pete", giving the structure in (44), in which, event-tmlly, the NP "Mary" substitutes for the argument variablex I.
Special M-Rules will have to be added to an M-granmarto achieve this kind of substitution.
"Normal" argument323substitution rules substitute for the variables in theircanonical positions, i.e.
as a subject or (indirect) objectdirectly under the clause node or as an object to apreposition in a prepositional object.
(43) Pete broke Mary's heart(44) CLNP VERB NPhJad "break" det/\headI / \NOUN VAR NOUN"Pete" x I "heart"The argument substitution rule for this type of constructlooks like the following:Rlo,h: if t I is of category NP andt 2 is of the form CL\[n~al,NP\[det/VAR(~), mu2\], mu3\]then: CL\[mul, NP\[de~/tl, mu2\], mu3\]In this rule tl is assigned genitive case.Rule R. 0 h applied to NP(Ymry) results in CL(Pete breakMary's ~e'ar t).In this way it is also possible to deal with the constructsmentioned in the introduction, as for example "x\] ram x 2down x3"s throat"~4.2 Variables Bound hy ArgumentsSentence (45) contains a possessive pronoun "his", thatrefers to the subject "the boy".
In the lexicon the basicexpression is represented as in (46).
(45) the boy lost his te~nper(46) VERBIVAR VERB NPV 1 "lose" /Ndet head/ \POSSPRO NOUNV I "t~nper"The M-Rule that inserts the CBE makes all possible forms ofthe possessive pronoun (his, her, their, etc.).
The substi-tution rule for the subject decides upon the form of thepossessive pronoun.In (47) the possessive pronoun "her" is bound to the object"the woman".
The treatment here is similar to the oneabove.
The argument to which the pronoun has to be bound isindicated in the lexicon.
(47) the man gave the woman her freedom5 ConclusionThe method described in this paper for the treatment ofidioms can deal with the problems traditionally related toexpressions of this type.
Structural transfer is notnecessary, since idioms are mapped onto basic meanings.
Thegrammar can operate on idiom structures in the same way asit operates on non-idiomatic structures , whil@, in the  caseof certain idioms, restrictions on operations are spec-ified.
A test implementation in the Rosetta machine trans-lation system has shown that this approach is promising.324AcknowledgementsThe author would like to thank all n~mbers of the Rosettateam, particularly Jan Landsbergen and Jan Odijk, for theirhelpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

(2) This paper deals only with idioms with a verb as head.Idioms of the type "spic and spaN' and "at any rate" are"fixed', i.e.
they cannot undergo any syntactic trans-formations.
They are therefore less interesting from atheoretical point of view.
In Rosetta fixed idioms will betreated as one word in the morphological component.
