The CGtask is an information extraction task tar-geting the recognition of events in text,represented as structured n-ary associa-tions of given physical entities.
In additionto addressing the cancer domain, the CGtask is differentiated from previous eventextraction tasks in the BioNLP ST seriesin addressing a wide range of pathologicalprocesses and multiple levels of biologicalorganization, ranging from the molecularthrough the cellular and organ levels up towhole organisms.
Final test set submis-sions were accepted from six teams.
Thehighest-performing system achieved an F-score of 55.4%.
This level of performanceis broadly comparable with the state ofthe art for established molecular-level ex-traction tasks, demonstrating that event ex-traction resources and methods generalizewell to higher levels of biological orga-nization and are applicable to the analy-sis of scientific texts on cancer.
The CGtask continues as an open challenge toall interested parties, with tools and re-sources available from http://2013.bionlp-st.org/.1 IntroductionDespite decades of focused research efforts, can-cer remains one of the leading causes of deathworldwide.
It is now well understood that canceris a broad class of diseases with a complex geneticbasis, involving changes in multiple molecularpathways (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; Haberet al 2011).
The scientific literature on cancer isenormous, and our understanding of cancer is de-veloping rapidly: a query of the PubMed literaturedatabase for cancer returns 2.7 million scien-tific article citations, with 140,000 citations from2012.
To build and maintain comprehensive, up-to-date knowledge bases on cancer genetics, auto-matic support for managing the literature is thusrequired.The BioNLP Shared Task (ST) series has beeninstrumental in encouraging the development ofmethods and resources for the automatic extrac-tion of bio-processes from text, but efforts withinthis framework have been almost exclusively fo-cused on normal physiological processes and onmolecular-level entities and events (Kim et al2011a; Kim et al 2011b).
To be relevant to can-cer biology, event extraction technology must begeneralized to be able to address also pathologi-cal processes as well as physical entities and pro-cesses at higher levels of biological organization,including e.g.
mutation, cell proliferation, apop-tosis, blood vessel development, and metastasis.The CG task aims to advance the development ofsuch event extraction methods and the capacity forautomatic analysis of texts on cancer biology.The CG task introduces a novel corpus cover-ing multiple subdomains of cancer biology, basedin part on a previously introduced angiogenesissubdomain resource (Pyysalo et al 2012a).
Toextend event extraction to upper levels of biolog-ical organization and pathological processes, thetask defines a set of 18 entity and 40 event typesbased on domain ontologies such as the Com-mon Anatomy Reference Ontology and Gene On-tology, more than doubling the number of entityand event types from those considered in previousBioNLP ST extraction tasks.This paper presents the design of the CG task,introduces the groups and systems taking part inthe task, and presents evaluation results and anal-ysis.58Gene or gene product Gene expression Positive regulation CarcinogenesisTheme ThemeCausetreatment with L-NAME inhibited growth of adenocarcinomaPlanned process Simple chemical Negative regulation Growth CancerThemeInstrument ThemeCauseFigure 1: Examples of CG task entities and event structures.
Visualizations generated using the BRATtool (Stenetorp et al 2012).2 Task definitionThe CG task goal is the automatic extraction ofevents (Ananiadou et al 2010) from text.
Theapplied representation and task setting extend onthose first established in the BioNLP ST 2009(Kim et al 2011a).
Each event has a type such asGROWTH or METASTASIS and is associated witha specific span of characters expressing the event,termed the event trigger.
Events can take any num-ber of arguments, each of which is identified asparticipating in the event in a specific role (e.g.Theme or Cause).
Event arguments may be either(physical) entities or other events, allowing com-plex event structures that capture e.g.
one eventcausing or preventing another.
Finally, events maybe marked by flags identifying extra-propositionalaspects such as occurrence in a speculative or neg-ative context.
Examples of CG task extraction tar-gets are shown in Figure 1.The following sections present the categoriesof annotation and the specific annotated types in-volved in the CG task: entities, relations, events,and event modifications.
To focus efforts on novelchallenges, the CG task follows the general con-vention of the BioNLP ST series of only requiringparticipants to extract events and their modifica-tions.
For other categories of annotation, correct(gold standard) annotations are provided also fortest data.2.1 EntitiesThe entity types defined in the CG task are shownin Table 1.
The molecular level entity types largelymatch the scope of types such as PROTEIN andCHEMICAL included in previous ST tasks (Kim etal., 2012; Pyysalo et al 2012b).
However, the CGtypes are more fine grained, and the types PRO-TEIN DOMAIN OR REGION and DNA DOMAIN ORREGION are used in favor of the non-specific typeENTITY, applied in a number of previous tasksfor additional event arguments (see Section 2.3).The definitions of the anatomical entity types areTypeORGANISMAnatomical entityORGANISM SUBDIVISIONANATOMICAL SYSTEMORGANMULTI-TISSUE STRUCTURETISSUEDEVELOPING ANATOMICAL STRUCTURECELLCELLULAR COMPONENTORGANISM SUBSTANCEIMMATERIAL ANATOMICAL ENTITYPATHOLOGICAL FORMATIONCANCERMolecular entityGENE OR GENE PRODUCTPROTEIN DOMAIN OR REGIONDNA DOMAIN OR REGIONSIMPLE CHEMICALAMINO ACIDTable 1: Entity types.

We refer to Ohta et al(2012) for more detailed discussion of the anatom-ical entity type definitions.2.2 RelationsThe CG task does not target the extraction ofany standalone relations.
However, following themodel of past BioNLP ST tasks, the CG corpus isannotated by Equiv (equivalence) relations, sym-metric, transitive relations that identify two entitymentions as referring to the same entity (Figure 2).These relations primarily mark local aliases andare applied only in evaluation.

For brevity, additional argument types are not shown in table: Locarguments take an anatomical entity type, and Site PROTEIN/DNA DOMAIN OR REGION.differences in references to equivalent entities areignored, so that e.g.
an event referring to CMLas its Theme instead of chronic myeloid leukemiawould be considered to match the event shown inFigure 2.2.3 EventsTable 2 summarizes the event types defined in theCG task.
As in most previous BioNLP ST tasksettings, the event types are defined primarily withreference to the Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburneret al 2000).
However, GO explicitly excludesfrom its scope pathological processes, which arecritically important to the CG task.
To capturepathological processes, we systematically expandthe scope GO-based event types to include alsoanalogous processes involving pathological enti-ties.
For example, statements such as ?cancergrowth?
are annotated with GROWTH events byanalogy to processes such as ?organ growth?.
Sec-ond, we introduce a number of event types ex-plicitly accounting for pathological processes withno analogous normal physiological process, suchas METASTASIS.
Finally, many important effectsare discussed in the literature through statementsinvolving experimenter action such as transfectand treat (Figure 1).
To capture such state-ments, we introduce the general PLANNED PRO-CESS type, defined with reference to the Ontol-ogy for Biomedical Investigations (Brinkman etal., 2010).The event argument roles largely match those60Domain Documents Query termsCarcinogenesis 150 cell transformation, neoplastic AND (proteins OR genes)Metastasis 100 neoplasm metastasis AND (proteins OR genes)Apoptosis 50 apoptosis AND (proteins OR genes)Glucose metabolism 50 (glucose/metabolism OR glycolysis) AND neoplasmsTable 3: Queries for document selection.
All query terms were restricted to MeSH Term matches only(e.g.
"apoptosis"[MeSH Terms])established in previous BioNLP ST tasks (Kim etal., 2012; Pyysalo et al 2012b): Theme identifiesthe arguments undergoing the primary effects ofthe event, Cause those that are responsible for itsoccurrence, and Participant those whose preciserole is not stated.
Site is used to identify specificparts of Theme entities affected (e.g.
phosphory-lated residues) and the Loc roles entities where theevent takes place (AtLoc) and start and end pointsof movement (FromLoc and ToLoc).2.4 Event modificationsThe CG task follows many previous BioNLP STtasks in including the event modification typesNEGATION and SPECULATION in its extractiontargets.
These modifications apply to events,marking them as explicitly negated and specula-tively stated, respectively (Kim et al 2011a).2.5 EvaluationThe CG task evaluation follows the criteria orig-inally defined in the BioNLP ST?09, requiringevents extracted by systems to otherwise matchgold standard events exactly, but allowing triggerspans to differ from gold spans by single words(approximate span matching) and not requiringmatching of additional arguments (see Table 2) forevents referred from other events (approximate re-cursive matching).
These criteria are discussed indetail by Kim et al(2011a).3 Corpus3.1 Document selectionThe corpus texts are the titles and abstracts of pub-lications from the PubMed literature database, se-lected on the basis of relevance to cancer genet-ics, specifically with respect to major subdomainsrelating to established hallmarks of cancer (Hana-han and Weinberg, 2000).
Of the 600 documentsforming the CG task corpus, 250 were previouslyreleased as part of the MLEE corpus (Pyysaloet al 2012a) involving the angiogenesis subdo-main.
The remaining 350 were selected by iter-Item Train Devel Test TotalDocuments 300 100 200 600Words 66 082 21 732 42 064 129 878Entities 11 034 3 665 6 984 21 683Relations 466 176 275 917Events 8 803 2 915 5 530 17 248Modifications 670 214 442 1 326Table 4: Corpus statisticsatively formulating PubMed queries consisting ofMeSH terms relevant to subdomains such as apop-tosis and metastasis (Table 3).
Following initialquery formulation, random sets of abstracts wereselected from each domain and manually exam-ined to select a final set of documents that specifi-cally discuss both the target process and its molec-ular foundations.3.2 Annotation processThe corpus annotation was created using the BRATannotation tool (Stenetorp et al 2012) by a singlePhD biologist with extensive experience in eventannotation (Tomoko Ohta).
For the entity anno-tation, we created preliminary annotation usingthe following automatic named entity and entitymention taggers: BANNER (Leaman and Gonza-lez, 2008) trained on the GENETAG corpus (Tan-abe et al 2005) for GENE OR GENE PRODUCTentities, Oscar4 (Jessop et al 2011) for SIMPLECHEMICAL and AMINO ACID entities, NERsuite1trained on the AnEM corpus (Ohta et al 2012)for anatomical entities, and LINNAEUS (Gerneret al 2010) for ORGANISM mentions.
Process-ing was performed on a custom pipeline originallydeveloped for the BioNLP ST?11 (Stenetorp et al2011).
Following preliminary automatic annota-tion, all entity annotations were manually revisedto create the final entity annotation.By contrast to entity annotation, no automaticpreprocessing was applied for event annotation toavoid any possibility of bias introduced by ini-tial application of automatic methods.
The eventannotation extended the guidelines and manual1http://nersuite.nlplab.org61Team Institution MembersTEES-2.1 University of Turku 1 BI (Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2013)NaCTeM National Centre for Text Mining 1 NLP (Miwa and Ananiadou, 2013)NCBI National Center for Biotechnology Information 3 BI (Liu et al 2013)RelAgent RelAgent Private Ltd. 1 LI, 1 CS (Ramanan and Nathan, 2013)UET-NIIUniversity of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam6 CS (Tran et al 2013)and National Institute of Informatics, JapanISI Indian Statistical Institute 2 ML, 2 NLP -Table 5: Participating teams and references to system descriptions.

Following the initial annotation, a num-ber of revision passes were made to further im-prove the consistency of the annotation using a va-riety of automatically supported methods.23.3 Corpus statisticsTable 4 summarizes the corpus statistics for thetraining, development and test sets, representing50%, 17%, and 33% of the documents, respec-tively.
The CG task corpus is the largest of theBioNLP ST 2013 corpora by most measures, in-cluding the number of annotated events.4 ParticipationFinal results to the CG task were successfully sub-mitted by six teams, from six different academicgroups and one company, representing a broadrange of expertise ranging from biology to ma-chine learning, natural language processing, andlinguistics (Table 5).The characteristics of the participating systemsare summarized in Table 6.
There is an interestingspread of extraction approaches, with two systemsapplying SVM-based pipeline architectures shown2There was no opportunity to train a second annotator inorder to evaluate IAA specifically for the new CG corpus an-notation.
However, based on our previous evaluation usingthe same protocol (Pyysalo et al 2012a), we expect the con-sistency of the final annotation to fall in the 70-80% F-scorerange (primary task evaluation criteria).successful in previous BioNLP ST events, oneapplying a joint pattern matching approach, onea rule-based approach, and two systems parsing-based approaches to event extraction.
Together,these systems represent all broad classes of ap-proaches applied to event extraction in previousBioNLP ST events.
Three of the six systems ad-dressed also the event modification (negation andspeculation) extraction aspects of the task.Although all systems perform syntactic analy-sis of input texts, there is a fair amount of vari-ety in the applied parsers, which include the parserof Charniak and Johnson (2005) with the biomed-ical domain model of McClosky (2009) and theStanford Dependency conversion (de Marneffeet al 2006) ?

as well as Enju (Miyao and Tsu-jii, 2008), GDep (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007), Stan-ford CoreNLP3, and a custom parser by RelAgent(Ramanan and Nathan, 2013).
Simple stemmingalgorithms such as that of Porter (1980) remainpopular for word-level processing, with just theNCBI system using a dedicated biomedical do-main lemmatizer (Liu et al 2012).The task setting explicitly allows the use of anyexternal resources, including other corpora, andpreviously released event resources contain sig-nificant numbers of annotations that are relevant3http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml62Team recall prec.

Nevertheless, only the TEES and NCBIteams made use of corpora other than the taskdata, both using the GE corpus (Kim et al 2012)and NCBI using also the EPI corpus (Pyysalo etal., 2012b).
In addition to corpora annotated forevents, lexical resources derived from such cor-pora, containing trigger and hedge expressions,were applied by three teams.We refer to the descriptions presented by eachof the participating teams (see Table 5) for furtherdetail on the systems and their implementations.5 ResultsThe primary evaluation results are summarized inTable 7.
The highest performance is achieved bythe established machine learning-based TEES sys-tem, with an F-score of 55%.
Previous versionsof the same system achieved the highest perfor-mance in the BioNLP ST?09 (52% F-score) andin four out of eight tasks in BioNLP ST?11 (53%F-score for the comparable GE task) (Bjo?rne andSalakoski, 2011).
The performance of the systemranked second, EventMine (Miwa et al 2012),is likewise broadly comparable to the results forthe same system on the GE task considered inBioNLP ST?09 and ?11.
The NCBI submis-sion also extends a system that participated in theST?11 GE task, then achieving a somewhat lowerF-score of 41.13% (Liu et al 2011).
By con-trast, the RelAgent, UET-NII and ISI submissionsinvolve systems that were not previously appliedin BioNLP ST events.
Thus, in each case wheresystem performance for previously proposed eventextraction tasks is known, the results indicate thatthe systems generalize to CG task extraction tar-gets without loss in performance.These parallels with results for previously intro-duced tasks involving molecular-level events areinteresting, in particular considering that the CGtask involves more than twice the number of en-tity and event types included in previously con-sidered BioNLP ST tasks.
The results suggestnot only that event extraction methods generalizewell to higher levels of biological organization,but also that overall performance is not primar-ily limited by the number of targeted types.
It isalso notable that the complexity of the task set-ting does not exclude rule-based systems such asthat of RelAgent, which scores within 10% pointsof the highest-ranking system.
While the parser-based systems of UET-NII and ISI perform be-low others here, it should be noted that related ap-proaches have achieved competitive performancein previous BioNLP ST tasks (McClosky et al2011), suggesting that further development couldlead to improvements for systems based on thesearchitectures.
As is characteristic for event extrac-tion systems in general, all systems show notablyhigher precision than recall, with the performanceof the UET-NII and ISI systems in particular pri-marily limited by low recall.The F-score results are shown separately foreach event type in Table 8.
As suggested by theoverall results, the novel categories of events in-volving anatomical and pathological entities arenot particularly challenging for most systems,with results roughly mirroring performance formolecular level events; the best results by eventcategory are 77% F-score for anatomical, 68%for pathological, and 73% for molecular.
Ofthe newly introduced CG event categories, onlyplanned processes involving intentional human in-tervention appear to represent difficulties, with thebest-performing system for PLANNED PROCESSreaching only 41% F-score.
Two previously es-tablished categories of events remain challenging:general events ?
best 53% F-score ?
includingBINDING (often taking multiple arguments) andLOCALIZATION (frequent additional arguments),and regulation category events, which often formcomplex event structures by involving events as ar-guments.
Event modifications, addressed by threeof the six participating teams, show comparativelylow levels of extraction performance, with a bestresult of 40% F-score for NEGATION and 30%for SPECULATION.
However, as in previous tasks(Kim et al 2011a), this is in part due to the com-pound nature of the problem: for an event modifi-cation attribute to be extracted correctly, the eventthat it attaches to must also be correct.Further details on system performance and anal-yses are available on the shared task home page.63Event TEES-2.1 NaCTeM NCBI RelAgent UET-NII ISIDEVELOPMENT 71.43 64.77 67.33 66.31 61.72 53.66BLOOD VESSEL DEVELOPM 85.28 78.82 81.92 79.60 21.49 13.56GROWTH 75.97 59.85 66.67 76.92 70.87 65.52DEATH 81.74 73.17 74.07 64.71 77.78 63.16CELL DEATH 73.30 75.18 78.05 66.98 25.17 7.35CELL PROLIFERATION 80.00 78.33 72.73 64.39 71.43 57.40CELL DIVISION 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00CELL DIFFERENTIATION 56.34 48.48 48.98 54.55 59.26 24.14REMODELING 30.00 22.22 21.05 40.00 20.00 23.53REPRODUCTION 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00Anatomical total 77.20 71.31 73.68 70.82 50.04 38.86MUTATION 38.00 41.05 25.11 27.36 27.91 9.52CARCINOGENESIS 77.94 72.18 67.14 64.12 35.96 24.72CELL TRANSFORMATION 81.56 82.54 71.13 67.07 57.14 32.39BREAKDOWN 76.74 70.13 76.54 42.42 58.67 50.70METASTASIS 70.91 51.05 52.69 47.79 56.41 26.20INFECTION 69.57 76.92 69.23 33.33 11.76 0.00Pathological total 67.51 59.78 54.19 48.14 46.90 25.17METABOLISM 83.87 70.27 74.29 80.00 68.75 71.43SYNTHESIS 78.26 71.11 78.26 53.57 64.71 48.65CATABOLISM 63.64 36.36 38.10 23.08 20.00 36.36GLYCOLYSIS 0.00 100.00 95.45 97.78 0.00 0.00AMINO ACID CATABOLISM 0.00 66.67 66.67 66.67 0.00 0.00GENE EXPRESSION 78.21 79.96 73.69 69.45 58.01 53.28TRANSCRIPTION 37.33 42.86 51.55 28.12 32.00 20.93TRANSLATION 40.00 22.22 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00PROTEIN PROCESSING 100.00 100.00 100.00 0.00 100.00 100.00ACETYLATION 100.00 100.00 66.67 100.00 66.67 66.67GLYCOSYLATION 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00PHOSPHORYLATION 63.33 70.37 53.12 64.15 58.33 50.00UBIQUITINATION 100.00 100.00 0.00 100.00 0.00 100.00DEPHOSPHORYLATION 0.00 80.00 100.00 100.00 0.00 0.00DNA METHYLATION 66.67 66.67 30.30 42.11 32.43 33.33DNA DEMETHYLATION 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00PATHWAY 71.30 59.07 51.14 34.29 18.31 35.64Molecular total 72.60 72.77 67.33 60.72 49.35 46.70BINDING 45.35 43.93 37.89 32.69 33.94 11.92DISSOCIATION 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00LOCALIZATION 54.83 57.20 47.58 45.22 44.94 35.94General total 52.20 53.08 44.70 40.89 41.76 29.59REGULATION 32.66 28.73 14.19 26.48 5.51 4.57POSITIVE REGULATION 45.89 44.18 34.70 38.40 13.00 12.33NEGATIVE REGULATION 47.79 43.17 33.20 40.47 10.30 12.16Regulation total 43.08 39.79 29.21 35.58 10.30 10.29PLANNED PROCESS 39.43 40.51 34.28 28.57 22.74 21.22Sub-total 56.75 53.50 48.56 46.37 31.72 25.90NEGATION 40.00 29.55 0.00 34.64 0.00 0.00SPECULATION 27.14 30.35 0.00 25.90 0.00 0.00Modification total 34.66 29.95 0.00 30.88 0.00 0.00Total 55.41 52.09 46.38 45.32 29.94 24.47Table 8: Primary evaluation F-scores by event type6 Discussion and conclusionsWe have presented the Cancer Genetics (CG) task,an information extraction task introduced as amain task of the BioNLP Shared Task (ST) 2013.The task is motivated by the needs of maintain-ing up-to-date knowledge bases of the enormousand fast-growing literature on cancer genetics, andextends previously proposed BioNLP ST tasks inseveral aspects, including the inclusion of enti-ties and events at levels of biological organiza-tion above the molecular and the explicit inclusionof pathological and planned processes among ex-traction targets.
To address these extraction goals,we introduced a new corpus covering various sub-domains of cancer genetics, annotated for 18 en-tity and 40 event types and marking over 17,000manually annotated events in 600 publication ab-stracts.Final submissions to the CG task were receivedfrom six groups, who applied a variety of ap-proaches including machine learning-based clas-64sifier pipelines, parsing-based approaches, andpattern- and rule-based systems.
The best-performing system achieved an F-score of 55.4%,a level of performance comparable to the state ofthe art in established molecular level event extrac-tion tasks.
The results indicate that event extrac-tion methods generalize well across the novel as-pects introduced in the CG task and that event ex-traction is applicable to the automatic processingof the cancer literature.Following convention in the BioNLP SharedTask series, the Cancer Genetics task will con-tinue as an open challenge available to all inter-ested participants.
The CG task corpus, supportingresources and evaluation tools are available fromhttp://2013.bionlp-st.org/.AcknowledgmentsWe wish to thank the BioNLP ST 2013 CG taskparticipants and supporting resource providers fortheir invaluable contributions to making this task asuccess.
