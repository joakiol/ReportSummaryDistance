Long-term querying of the current  s ta te  ofdespondenc ~ with regard to the prospects ofMechanics1 Trans lat ion.The immediate effect of the recently issuedReport on Computers inTranslation andL~is t i cs .
LANGUAGE ~ MACHINES ~J3 hasbeen to spread the view that there is nofuture at all for research in MechanicalTranslation as such; a view which contrastssharply with the earlier, euphoric view that(now that disc-files provide computers withindefinitely large memory-systems which can bequickly searched by random-access procedures)the Mechanical Translation research problemwas all but "solved".It is possible, however, that this second, ultra-despondent view is as exaggerated as the firstone was; all the more so as t h e ~  is writtenfrom a very narrow research background withoutiny indication of this narrowness being ~iven.F~r example, an M.T.
Thesaurus has never yetbeen put on a machine; (_~ and the analogy betweenM.T.

The Basic Principle of the Man-Machine interact!on.The input  to  the  machine i s  a s t ressed  and contouredphrasing, i.e.
a phrasing with some stresses marked andminimal syntactic naming of the constituent words.Research to produce this input mechanically, by aphrasing-stresser-and-parse~ is currently being supportedby the Office of Scientific and Technical Information,London; at present the program (Mark II) segments thetext into phrasings mechanically, but does not eithermark the stressed words or provide any snytactic naming.
(see Appendix A).
In the mini-demonstation of the ~an-maahine interaction, therefore, (the only one which isalready operational as a machine,) the operator at presenttypes in a single phrasing at a time minus the stressedwords, which have been pre-marked on his text.
Thus, hedoes not type in a complete phrasing, but what we havecalled a phrasing-frame.
(Later the machine will computethe phrasing-frame from the text~ Examples of assortedphrasing-frames are given below:ASSORTED PHRASING-FRAMES~'"  I~ '~\ ]  ~o~ .

~he marker J to set inoperation a routine to inter-connect syntactiaallyconnected phrasings will be discussed in a furtherpublicationOn receiving the phrasing-frame, the machine questionsthe opea~or in order to make him specify further, fromhis general knowledge of the text and of its subject,what the cOntext of the particular phraslng-frame is.The example given below, in which is progressivelyspecified the correct French translation of an English~erb of motion (one of the notoriously difficult ~ l i shforms to  t rans la te  in to  French)  shows how compl i ca tedth i s  quest ion ing  can be.

program has either gotto be a blamk space (when the program fails), or aunique translation which is known to be correct.
Nowuniqueness of output can be brutally produced, as every-body knows~programming the machine only to print outone eg any set of alternatives.
Correctness, however,can only be achieved by the target-language translationhaving been approved beforehand by the operator, from ~:cues which the machine gives him, or which he gives themachine - i~ his own language; i.e.
in the sourcelanguage.
The real use, therefore, of the three-stagequestion-and-answer routine exemplified above, is thatit enables an Englishman with a console but who does.8.not know any French to produce a unique and correctidiomatic French translation of an English textrprovidedthat he is prepared to take the trouble to pre-processthe English text so that it is finally restated in aFrenchified sort of way.
After this the machine canof course transcribe it into French.In other words, a machine-aided translation programbasically consists -a) of programming the machine to pick up t~e ambiguitiesin the source language which the target-languagewill not tolerste (not the other way round) andof making the operator produce the additionalinformation which will resolve them.Take, as example, the phrasing/ fo r  a s tandb2for~.This looks technical and unambiguous in the English,but comparative examination of bi-lingual text showedthat it translated into French (and in the same document)as eitheri)/d'une force d'urgence~ i.e./"of an emer~ency force/or il) /pour une force de r6serve/ i.e.
/"for a reservefo rce" / ,accord ing to  soph is t i ca ted  cons iderat ions  of  context .Therefore ,  when the operator  types  the techn ica l  termSTANDBY FORCE in to  the machine, in order  to  f i l l  up thegaps in the phrasing-frame /FOR A .......... \ [NS~\ ]  \[AdjJthe machine has got to answer him back:DO YOU MEANA AN EMERGENCY FORCEB A RESERVE FORCEThe operator then has to choose, and type back intothe machine the alternative he wants, after which themachine can make the translation.b) 8imil&z~,,.~ way mustmbefound~ef  emab~ng themachine to p ick  up, from cues in the source language,  themetaphors and idioms which the ta rget - language w i l l  notto le ra te /and  to ass i s t  the operator  to  rephrase  thes t re tch  of  text  concerne~d~in terms which the ta rget -language w i l l  to le ra te~he d i f fe rence  between idiomsand metaphors i s  that  id iems can be mechanica l ly  p ickedup and matched by an idiom d ic t ionary ,  whereas metaphorscan ' t .c) Similarly again, the machine must be programmed topick up, from the source language input, the con-structions which the target-language will not tolerate,and assist the operator to transform these into con-structions which the target-language will tolerate(e.g.
to turm English passives into FreL~ch actives,and the adjectives of English adjective-noun stringsinto French post-positioned prepositional phrases).Thus the whole translating work, really, is donewithin the source language.
Once you can preprocessyour English input into a Frenchified shape in therespects a), b), c), above, the machine can transformthis Frenchified English, with no trouble at all, intoelegant French.The strategic hope, of course, is that by analysingthe printouts produced by a large number of sequencesof such machine-man interactions, in translating manytypes of texts, we shall ultimately learn how to make themachine answer, as well as ask, some of the rounds ofquestions, (as is already being done in a whole rangeof machine "edit" programs), so that the machine shallprogressively become able to do more of the Frenchifi-cation process for itself; thus finally producing, (ifthe machine ever became able completely to take over)exceedingly slow but reliable machine translation, -which could~subsequsntly again)be speeded up.Before further discussion of the extent to which thisstrategic hope is a real hope and haw much a mere piousaspiration, i.e.
the prospect, I will now set out thekvpothesis (as opposed to the strategy) of the experi-ment.VI.
The hypothesis which the translation-model gives isthe following:ATranslation consists of the pairing of a phrasing,P7 ' in Language A, with another ~hrasing, P2 ~ inLanguage B, in such a way that PI ~ ~1~formsan analogy with PI A, in a sense of "analogy" whichcam be ostensively defined intterms of the model.Thus translating a phrasing into another language isno different, (according to this translation-model)from defining it, producing a parallel-phrasing to it,reiterating or otherwise further specifying it, in thesame language.
~The advantage of the model is that unambiguouscriteria of the formation of such a pairing can be given.Por any response given by the operator to a machine-ques~tion will form such a ,pair: the first member of the pairwill be the original phrasing, (in English), the secondthe chosen machine-specification (called by us a template).10.also in English.
Then another pair will be formedwhenever the machine translates the operator's finalchoice of template into French; the first member of thepair in this case, will be the final template chosen,and the seoond member will be the translation into French,with the stressed words translated and inserted intotheir correct places.
Then again, an intermediate pairmay be formed of which each member is a template; thefirst member of such a pair will be a more abstracttemplate chosen a t the  first round of man-machine inter-action, while the second member of it will be the moreconcrete template chosen by the operator at the Secondround of man-machine interaction; and so on recursively.Any such pairing formed by the translation model,whether between English phrasing and template, or betweentemplate and template, or between template and Frenchphrasing, we shall call a semantic square.
A philosophicdiscussion of the notion of semantic square is given inanother publication ~.A semantic sauare (in terms of thls model) consistsof the pairing of any two linguistic sequences P1 an.d P2,PI and P2 each having the following characteristics.i) each has two stressed segments (which when PI ispaired to P2, form points of the square).ii) each has these embedded in some phrasing-frame,(which, when PI is paired to P2 forms the fram._.._!
of thesquare).iii) each has been selected as synonymous @ith theother at least once,either by the operator or by themachine.Thus, according to the model, translation consistsof sequential semantic-square forming, the sequence ofsemantic squares thus formed continuing until it isbrought to an end by the machine printim~ out a squarewhich has a target-language phrasing as its second ~amber.To make all this clearer, let us further developthe example of man-machine interaction given above>byassumin~ that the phrasing to be translated is/HE WENTto  the o l~q~/,To translate this, the operator types in/HE...E AST~aDVER3~tO the.....8~/~ ~and chooses, at the first round of questioning, theabstract templateH~' COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIF~TE BEING.11.The first semantic aquare of this sequence formed bythe model is thus:/HE wm+_._~o TH~Po~_~/HE COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE BEING/.The machine then asks: DO YOU MEANA HE REVEALED-ALL TO THE ENEMYB HE TOLD-A~STORY TO SOME LISTENERC HE CONSULTED WITH SOME AUTHORITYThe operator chooses A, thus forming the secondsemantic square in the sequence:/HE COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE-BEING//HE HEVEAZm>-AI~ TO raRE E~Emr/The operator then types in the stressed word /POLICE/(to specify the nature of the enemy), and the machinethen forms the final semamtic-square:/HE ~VE~mD-ALL  TO THEd/IL TOUT RE~ELA AUX FLICS/"FLICS" having been pro-chosen by the operator's choicesof template from a bi-lingual tree-dictionary-entry forthe English word "police" with nodes as follows:Ng:Xllie coa~IAssariat' IThus the sequence of semantic',~squares formed bythis operation of.
the model isHE WENT TO THE POLICEHE C-~---MMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE-BEING2 HE COMMUNICATED WITH SOME ANIMATE BEING HE REVEALED-ALL TO THE ENEMY.12.HE REVEAlED-ALL TO THE ENEMY3 IL TOUT REVELA AUX FLICS-----This square-sequence, with its AB BC CD overlap ofcontent, I will call the semantic deep-structure ofthe mode~s translation-operation, and the tree-structuregiven above I will call the semantic deep-structure ofthe dictionary-entry.The totality of semantic deep-structures given bythe model is the modei ls ~otal semantic-field.V_~ This, stated in the briefest possible terms, isthe hypothesis given by the model.
Now as to the pros-pect of developing this line of research.The first thing to say is that the model makes clearthe unsuitability of the ordinary digital computer ascompared to a human being for performing translation.For in this translation-model the computer handles eachphrasing of the input text as a separate unit, and forcesthe operator, by successive rounds of questioning, so tospecify it that it can be translated unambi~aously intoFrench.
But the human being, who does not treat eachphrasing of a text as a separate unit, but who uses hisunderstanding of the sarlier phrasings of a text to~aide him in hls understanding of the later ones, doesnot have to ask himself nearly so many questions.
Aprogressive learning-model of translation, then, is whatis really required, rather than the present single-phrasing-matching model.
On the other hand, the com-plezity which has to be introduced into the model toaccount for all the differing French translations whichhave to be made of a single piece of English, accordingto its context, this would have to be introduced intoany effective M.T.
program: since you cannot retrievefrom any computerised data-system any data which youhave not first put in.
But this second t~pe of com-plexity can be put into the machine gradually, byfeeding in data obtained from examining the inter-lingual correspondenc~in a large corpus of bi-lingualtext.There is, however, another, muc~ deeper obstacleto developing this research, and that is that (as M.T.research-workers have for some time past muspected)bi-lingual dictionaries provide almost no clue tosemantic deep-structure.Within the context of the present experiment thisbecame apparent in examining the English word "deliber-ations".
The examination began with the constructionof a dictionary-entry-card of the following form:English: DELIBERATIONSFrench: ~ OELIB~Pd~TIONSThis entry being queried (and the maker of it havingdefended himself by saying that "deliberations" wasthe only word he knew of in English which could reallybe translated by the corresponding word in French), itwas checked with Vinay's Dictionary~1~which ~ave theentry /d~bats mp1, discussion/.
However, w~en aninvestigation whs made of how it was act~l ly  ~ranslatedin the corpus of text, it only occurred once, where itwas translated "membres", as follows:EnglishThe illustrative and comparativematerials presentedmay~he lp fu lto the deliberations of this committeeFrenchLes donn~'es explicativeset comuaratives ( )se r~v~leront, peut-etretr~s utilespou--'~ les me-------mbres du comit~Moreover, the tramslator, in translating it t~us, wasquite right; not only because "utiles" in French, likesa concrete complement, but also because this is whatthe  passage  means .However, this t ~ a  semantic deep-structurefor the hi-lingual dictlonary-entry of ~deliberations"of the following form:.,.

(Actual output froma trial run of the program is given in Appendix ~).It has been implemented only on an I.C.T.

facility, to which a single keyboardhas been attlched, just under the print-out, on whichthe machine's "replies" to the operator, as well as his"questions" appear.

Even these cards, however, are onlypunched as required; the basic triple dictionary, fromwhich the Thesaurus is being built up, is being stored onordinary business equipment, (Twinlock Hand i~e~inderHRA3 handled with a Shunic Signalling System ~ Paperand a SASCO System so as to ensure maximum flexibilityand ease of entry-cham~e)oMark II of this program is to be implemented on ~nI.CoT.
