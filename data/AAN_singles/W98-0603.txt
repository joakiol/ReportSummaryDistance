eduAbst ract1In this paper, we address representation issues ofChinese nominals.
In particular, we look at lexicalrules as a conceptual tool to link forms with the samesemantics as is the case between ominalisations andthe forms they are derived from.
We also addressChinese compounds, illustrating how to recover im-plicit semantic relations in nominal compounds.
Fi-nally, we show how to translate Chinese nontinalswithin a knowledge-based framework.1 In t roduct ionIn this paper, we present results of a theoretical andan applied investigation, within a knowledge baseframework, on the building and processing of com-putational semantic lexicons, as reflected by experi-ments done on Spanish, English and Chinese, with alarge scale application on Spanish.
The multilingualdictionaries making process (Viegas and Raskin,1998) has been tested and attested for Mikrokos-mos, a machine translation system (Nirenburg etal., 1996) from Spanish and Chinese to English.
2Here, we focus on Chinese nominals and compoundsin terms of representation a d processing.In Section2, we briefly present the informationcarried inside Mikrokosmos lexicons.
In Section 3,we show how a semantic-based transcategorial p-proach is best fitted to account for nominalisationsand their derived forms.
Formally, we use the con-ceptual tool of lexical rules as described in (Viegaset al, 1996).
In Section 4, we address the Irans-lation of Chinese nominal compounds into Englishusing semantic information and word order informa-tion.
We show the advantage of a transcategorialapproach to lexicon representation and investigatesome trade-offs between an interlingua nd transferapproach to nominal compounding.XThis work has been supported in part by DoD undercontract number MDA-904-92-C-5189.2The interested reader can visit the Mikrokosmos siteat http://crl .nmsu.edu/Research/Projects/mikro/.2 A Br ie f  Overv iew on  the  St ructureo f  M ik rokosmos  Lex iconsIn Mikrokosmos, the lexical information is dis-tributed among various levels, relevant o phonol-ogy, orthography, morphology, syntax, semantics,syntax-semantic linking, stylistics, paradigmatic andsyntagmatic information, and also database typemanagement information.
3Each entry consists of a list of words, stored in thelexicon independently of their POS (the verb andnoun form of walk are under the same superentry).Each word meaning is identified by a unique iden-tificator, or lexeme (Onyshkevych and Nirenburg,1994).
Homonyms and all meaning shifts of polyse-mous words are listed under one single superentry.
4We illustrate in Figure 1 relevant aspects, for thispaper, of a lexicon entry via the description of twosenses of the Chinese word ~ (activity): WorkAc-tivity and Exercise, which are well defined sym-bols or concepts in the Mikrokosmos ontology as de-scribed in (Mahesh, 1996).Word meanings in Mikrokosmos are representedpartly in the lexicon and partly in the ontology.
Wehave strived to achieve an intermediate grain size ofmeaning representation in both the lexicon and theontology: many word senses have direct mappingsto concepts in the ontology; many others must bedecomposed and mapped indirectly through compo-sition and modification of ontological concepts.
Wehave developed a set of guidelines and a trainingmethodology that results in acceptable quality anduniformity in lexical and ontological representations(Mahesh, 1996; Viegas and Raskin, 1998).
In prin-ciple, the separation between ontology and lexiconis as follows: language-neutral meanings are storedin the former; language-specific information in thelatter.We keep the number of concepts well below thenumber of lexical items for a given language, suchaDeLails on these zones can be found in (Viegas andRaskin, 1998; Meyer et al, 1990).4See (Weinreich, 1964), (Fillmore, 1971), (Cruse,1993), (Pustejovsky, 1995) for interesting accounts onhomography/polysemy.
See (Bouillon et al, 1992),(Busa, 1996) for accounts on nominals.20'~-N1"cat: N .\] dfn: events concerning the jobs people doeng.transl: activity\[root: \[~\]1syn: \[semRep: o~JsemRep: \ [~  WorkActivity\]:~-N2 cat:dfn:eng.transl:syn:.semRep:Nactivity for nlalntalnlng healthexerciseFigure 1: Partial Entry for the Chinese word N~.that, for instance, the concept Ingest can be lex-icalised as ~; (eat.)

The advantage of MSLRs is twofold:first, they can be considered as a means to reduce thenumber of lexicon entry types, and generally to makethe acquisition process faster and cheaper; second,they can enhance the results of analysis processingby creating new entries for unknown words from thelexicon, found in corpora.
Lexical rules have beenaddressed by many researchers.
Here we apply Vie-gas et al (1996) methodology to Chinese.Briefly, applying MSLRs to the Spanish entrycomprar (buy), our MSLR generator produced au-tomatically 26 new entries (comprador-N1 (buyer),comprable-Adj (buyable), etc).
This includes cre-ating new syntax, semantics and syntax-semanticmappings with correct subcategorisations and alsothe right semantics; for instance, the lexical entry forcornprable will have the subcategorisation for pred-icative and attributive adjectives and the semanticsadds the attribute "FeasibilityAttribute" to the ba-sic meaning "Buy" of comprar.
The form list gen-erated by the morpho-semantic generator is checkedagainst MRDs, dictionaries and corpora: only theforms found in them are submitted to the acquisi-tion process.MSLRs constitute a powerful conceptual tool toextend a core lexicon from a monolingual viewpoint.We applied the same methodology to Chinese.
Therules are language independent, what is language de-pendent is the morphemes to which they can apply.For Chinese, we do not have to worry about develop-ing a morpho-semantic generator as the productiv-ity in morphology is poor, if one excepts compoundscharacters in which semantics is not compositional(see the example of ~ (glucose) below).
In thislatter case, we acquired the entry manually.
So rulesare used to link nominalisations to verbs, and viceversa, meaning that once verbs have been acquired,nominal derivations can be produced automaticallyusing rules.

From an acquisition viewpoint,it is cheaper to use the mechanism of lexical rules toautomatically produce nouns from verbs, with thesame semantics, this is due to our transcategorialapproach to semantics, where the same piece of se-mantics can be lexicalised as either a Noun or Verb.4 A Transcategor ia l  ApproachCompounding in Chinese is a common phenomenon(Jin, 1994; Jin and Chen, 1995; Palmer and Wu,1995).
It is mainly used to combine i) characterswhose semantics i different and non compositional,and ii) sequences of nouns.In i) we create entries for single characters andentries for combined characters, (e.g., (2)):(2) a.
~ j  (grape)b.
 (sugar)c. ~j~j~ (glucose)In this paper we are concerned with ii) only.
Inthe following, we investigate three ways to trans-late Chinese nominal compounds into English, usingword order information, semantic information andco-occurring information in syntactic, semantic andtransfer approaches, respectively.4.1 A. Syntact ic  A.pproachCompounds proliferate in Chinese.
The head ofthe compound seems to be easily identified as thelast noun in the sequence, and therefore in thetask of translating Chinese compounds into Englishcompounds, where English also makes use of com-pounds as opposed to say French, one could adopt atransfer-based approach, where each Chinese nounis translated into English in the same sequence: 1~~ (application software); ~$.~ q~ ~.~ (datamanagement system).
It gets a bit more complex21when there is a large sequence of nouns in English,whereas it is still acceptable and normal ill Chi-nese.
In our corpus we found compounds contain-ing up to 6 nouns: ~ ~ ~ t~1~ ~(~ (military theory test database management sys-tem) (the management system of database for test-ing military theory).
In these cases, it is difficultto comprehend the compound in English and some"linking information" is needed to break the com-pound and make it understandable in English.
Thisis where the semantics comes in, as one needs to un-derstand the underlying relationships between thenouns, and identify "sub-heads" inside the Chinesecompounds, which will become the heads of En-glish smaller compounds linked via relations.
Forinstance, in ~t1~ ~ ~ ~ '~  ~ (mili-tary theory test database management system)(themanagement system of database for testing militarytheory) one might want to "break" the Chinese com-pound into smaller English compounds "manage-ment system," " database" and "military theory"with a relation "test" between the last compounds(the management system of database for testing mil-itary theories).4.2 A Lex lco-Semant ic  ApproachWe now show examples of how the semantics canhelp identify sub-heads inside the Chinese compound(the head of the Chinese compound is the last noun).Second, we show how a transcategorial pproach canhelp go from an NN compound ~:  ~ (economypolicy) in Chinese to AdjN constructions (economicpolicy) in English.
Finally, we show how nominalmismatches are dealt with as a generation issue.For illustration purposes, we will mainly considercompounds composed of two nouns; however, thissemantic approach applies to more than 2 nouns.Lexemes can be mapped to Objects (O) (';Car"car), Events (E) ("Explode" explosion), Relations(R) ("Utilizes" use) or Attributes (A) ("ColourAt-tribute" colour).
In the case of NNs, we have 14combinations allowed (RR and AA do not seem toco-occur), where E, O and R can be heads, with thefollowing hierarchy of headhood:E>R>OWhen the semantics of the NN is expressed witha combination of identical types (e.g.
EE or OO),the semantic analyser must score the constraints be-tween the two nouns to find the head.
Sometimes itis possible to find the semantic relation linking thetwo nouns in the ontological entry of the nouns, asin the example OO below.
(O0) Object - Object\[np \[mod ~\ [L  (n, ji4suan4jil, computer, Computer)\]\[n ~ 7~ (n, ji.lshu4, technology, Technology)\]\]Here, both nouns are typed as O, and therefore weneed a mechanism to assign tile head.
The genera-tor must identify the underlying relation between theOs.
This can be done by searching for a relation Rin the ontology shared by" the 20s,  such as "applied-to" with a domain which is in an ISA relationshipwith "technology" and a range also in an ISA rela-tionship with "computer".
Needless to say that thisapproach is knowledge intensive, and in case we donot have this type of knowledge ncoded we rely on atransfer-based approach following tlle Chinese wordorder.
Here, we could successfully generate technol-ogy about computer and computer technology, with apreference on the latter.
(OR) Object - Relationlnp \[mod ~: (n, hang2, business, AreaOfExpertise)\]\[n ~ (n, zhang3, leader, HeadOf)\]\]"HeadOf" is a relation and therefore the head,as the other noun is an O.
The generator can lex-icalise this as leader of business or business leadervia a rule; the latter is assigned a preference in ab-sence of modifiers such that we can still generatethe leader of a big business instead of big businessleader.
Note that we do not need to use the hierar-chy in the case of only two Ns to identify the headbecause, the head is the last noun in a Chinese com-pound; we showed this example, in case it enteredin a larger compound such as "business leader ma-jor office" where one might want to break it as "themajor office" of "the business leader".
(EA) Event - Attribute\[np \[mod \ [ I~  (n, gonglzuo4, work, ~VorkActivity)\]\[n ~ (n, fanglshi4, style, StyleAttribute)\]\]Here, E is the head and this semantics is lexi-calised as way of working or work style, with againa preference on the latter.
(OR) illustrates our transcategorial pproach:\[np lmod ~g (n, jinglji4, economy, Economy)\]\[n ~ (n, xiao4)'i4, benefit, BenefitFrom)\]\]Here is a case where our transcategorial pproachto lexicon representation helps in generating anAdjN construction economic benefit for an NN Chi-nese compound; this is due to the fact that botheconomy and economic share the same semantics,and thus the generator will present both possibil-ities; moreover, they co-occur in English whereaseconomy and benefit do not.
The head is easily iden-tified in R "BenefitFrom" and as such the compoundcould also be generated as benefit to economy.
(OEE) illustrates a phraselap lmod\[mod ~t~\]~ (abbr, kelji4, science&technology, Science)\]\[n ~ ~#~ In, gonglguanl, attack-key-problem, Solve+Att)\]\]\[n ~J~,~ (n, ji4hua4, plan, PlanningEvent)\]\]22This NNN compound presents a case of mismatchbetween Chinese and English, it can be paraphrasedas: plan to solve key problems in science and technol-ogy.
Here, a transfer-based approach would fail totranslate adequately, as ~ (attack-key-problem)must be expressed as an expression equivalent osolving important problems, and as such the follow-ing English compound science technology solving keyproblem plans must be broken into smaller com-pounds with explicit relations between them.
sThese examples illustrate why a semantic ap-proach is preferable, and sometimes necessary, totranslate Chinese compounds into English.
How-ever, as discussed earlier, 1) this approach is knowl-edge intensive, and 2) English compounding seemsto follow the same Chinese word order regularlyenough so that we consider using a transfer approachas a back-up to generation.4.3 A Trans fer -based  ApproachSemantics can be expensive to use so we also relyon a transfer-based approach as a back-up methodwhen semantics fails to give us the semantic relationbetween the nouns.
We can do this because Englishallows compounding (whereas for French and Span-ish, a transfer approach would be more problematicas compounding is not as productive and relationsmust be identified).
However, as we noticed previ-ously, it can become difficult in English to get themeaning of a large compound, it is therefore betterto "break" the compound into 2 or 3 compounds.We hope to bypass part of this problem by usingco-occurring information in a transfer approachfi\[np\[mod ~.~JL  (n, ji4suandjil, computer, Computer)\]lmod\[mod\[mod ~J~ (n, juntshi4, military-affairs, MiiitaryActivity)\]\[n ~ i~ (n, li31un4, theory, Theory)\]\]\[n :9~ (n, kao3he2, test, Examination)\]\]\[n ~ J~ (n, ti2ku4, database, Database)\]\]computer database for test of ~heory of militaryaffairsIn this case, only co-occurring information will sig-nal the generator to link "computer" to "database"to produce "computer database"; this informationmust be encoded in the lexicon, as we show in nextsection.\[nplmodlmod\[rood\[mod ~i~ (n, junlshi4, military-affaim, MilitaryAetiwty)\]Sin "Solve+Attitude", Attitude reflects the impor-tance attached to the event.6We saw that in a semantic approach the headhoodhierarchy provides a good clue to break a compound.\[n ~ (n, li31un4, theory, Theory)\]\]\[n :~J~ (n, kao3he2, test, Examination)\]\] .\[n ~J\[~ (abbr, ti2ku4, text database, Database)\]\]\[np\[mod ~ (n, guan31i3, management, ManagementAetivity)\]\[n ~ (n, xi4tong3, system, System)\]\]\]Following the Chinese word order seems to be ac-ceptable in English, to produce military theory testdatabase management system.
However, a bettertranslation might be the management system of adatabase for testing military theory, in which case,relations between ouns must be made explicit, us-ing the semantic information found in the ontologicalconcepts in a semantic approach.5 Processing of Chinese Nominalsand Nominal CompoundsWe utilise an efficient constraint-based control mech-anism called Hunter-Gatherer (HG) (Beale, 1997)to process Chinese nominals and compounds.
Thismechanism has been successfully applied to the anal-ysis of Spanish and generation of English.
We referto (Beale et al, 1995) for details on how the seman-tic analyser works, and (Beale et at., 1997) on howthe generator works.In this paper, we are interested in showing howHG allows us to mark certain compositions as beingdependent on each other: once we \]lave two lexiconentries that we know go together, from either syntac-tic, lexical, or semantic viewpoints, HG will ensurethat they are correctly treated.
HG gives preferenceto words which "co-occur" together, from any of theabove viewpoints.
The analyser simply needs to de-tect the co-occurrence and add the constraint hatthe corresponding senses be used together.In the case of "computer database," the lexiconentry for "database" encodes the syntagmatic re-lation (LSFSyn) which keeps the semantics of thenouns compositional nd signals the processor (anal-yser or generator) to consider the nouns as syntac-tically linked:#O=\[key: "~ \]~",reh lsyntagmati?
: LSFSyn \[base: #0,co-occur: \[key: " ~ ~\[ ~" ,  sense: n i, ...\]\]\]\]We provide below the example of a Chinese sen-tence, its English translation and relevant parts ofthe result of the semantic analysis, showing the anal-ysis of the compound ~ ~ "tackle-key-problem".Chinese Sentence Example  i,~ 4` ~ ~ ~ I~1m~.~,~ J-:}.?

We showedhow to use lexico-semantic rules to relate differentforms carrying the same semantics.
These rules canbe applied at run time in analysis, thus facilitatinga syntactico-semantic re overy for unknown words.Concerning compounds, we have shown that we can-not avoid a semantic approach if we want a highquality translation, because of the number of nounswhich can enter into a Chinese compound makingit difficult to get the meaning of the compound inEnglish.
Thus, breaking the compound necessitatesan understanding of the Chinese compound.
How-ever, we have suggested transfer-like approach forChinese to English translation with the use of co-occurrences to "signal" privileged lexical inks (com-puter database).We have illustrated that by considering tile in-formation in the lexicon as constraints, the linguis-tic difference between pure compositionality and co-occurrent information becomes a virtual differencefor ttG.Re ferencesS.
