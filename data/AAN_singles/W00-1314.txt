R. Chinalesun, ybjin, yfsun, ldu@sonata.iscas.ac.cnAbstractIn this paper, a method for the word alignmentof English-Chinese corpus based on chunks isproposed.
The chunks of English sentences areidentified firstly.
Then the chunk boundaries ofChinese sentences are predicted by thetranslations of English chunks and heuristicinformation.
The ambiguities of Chinese chunkboundaries are resolved by the coterminouswords in English chunks.
With the chunkaligned bilingual corpus, a translation relationprobability is proposed to align words.
Finally,we evaluate our system by real corpus andpresent the experiment results.Key Words: Word Alignment, Chunk Alignment,Bilingual Corpus, Lexicon Extraction1 IntroductionWith the easier access to bilingual corpora, thereis a tendency in NLP community to process andrefine the bilingual corpora, which can serve asthe knowledge base in support of many NLPapplications, such as automatic or human-aidtranslation, multilingual terminology andlexicography, multilingual information retrievalsystem, etc.Different NLP applications need differentbilingual corpora, which are aligned at differentlevel.
They can be divided by the nature of thesegment to section level, paragraph level,sentence level, phrase level, word level, bytelevel, etc.As for our applications, we choose the chunklevel to do alignment based on followingconsiderations.
Firstly, our applications, whichinclude an example-based machine translationsystem, a computer aid translation system and amultilingual information retrieval system, needthe alignment below the sentence level, onwhich we can acquire bilingual word and phrasedictionaries and.
other useful translationinformation.
Secondly, the word level alignmentbetween English and Chinese language isdifficult to deal with.
There are no cognatewords.
The change in Chinese word order andword POS always produce many null andmistake correspondences.
Next, we observe thephenomenon that when we translate the Englishsentence to Chinese sentence, all the words inone English chunk tend to be translated as oneblock of Chinese words which are coterminous.The word orders within these blocks tend tokeep with the English chunk, also.
So there arestronger boundaries between chunks thanbetween words when we translate texts.
Finally,as we all known, chunk has been assignedsyntactic structure (Steven Abney, 1991), whichcomprises a connected sub-graph of thesentence's parse tree.
So it's possible to alignsentence structure and obtain translationgrammars based on chunks by parsing.Many researchers have studied the textalignment problem and a number of quiteencouraging results have been reported todifferent level alignments.
Withsentence-aligned corpus ready in hand, we focusour attention on the intra-sentence alignmentbetween the sentence pairs.
In this paper, amethod for the word alignment ofEnglish-Chinese corpus based on chunks isproposed.
The chunks of English sentences areidentified firstly.
Then the chunk boundaries ofChinese sentences are predicted by the bilinguallexicon and synonymy Chinese dictionary andheuristic information.
The ambiguities ofChinese chunk boundaries are resolved by thecoterminous words in English chunks.
With the110chunk aligned bilingual corpus, a translationrelation probability is proposed to align words.Although this paper is related toEnglish-Chinese word alignment, he idea canbe used to any other language bilingual corpora.In the following sections, we first present a briefreview of related work in word alignment.
Thendiscuss our alignment algorithm based onchunks in detail.
Following this is an analysis ofour experimental results.
Finally, we close ourpaper with a discussion of future work.2 Related WorkThere are basically two kinds of approaches onword alignment: he statistical-based approaches(Brown et.
al., 1990; Gale & Church, 1991;Dagan et.
al.
1993; Chang, 1994), and thelexicon-based approaches (Ker & Chang, 1997;Wang et.
al., 1999).Several translation models based on wordalignment are built by Brown et al (1990) inorder to implement the English-Frenchstatistical machine translation.
The probabilities,such as translation probability, fertilityprobability, distortion probability, are estimatedby EM algorithm.
The Z 2 measure is used byGale & Church (1991) to align partial words.Dagan (1993) uses an improved Brown model toalign the words for texts including OCR noise.They first align word partially by characterstring matching.
Then use the translation modelto align words.
Chang (1994) uses the POSprobability rather than translation probability inBrown model to align the English-Chinese POStagged corpus.
Ker & Chang (1997) propose anapproach to align Chinese English corpus basedon semantic class.
There are two semanticclasses are used in their model.
One is thesemantic class of Longman lexicon ofcontemporary English, the other is synonymyChinese dictionary.
The semantic lass rules oftranslation between Chinese and English areextracted from large-scale training corpus.
ThenChinese and English words are aligned by theserules.
Wang (1999) also uses the lexicons toalign the Chinese English bilingual corpus.
Hismodel is based on bilingual lexicon, sensesimilarity and location distortion probability.The statistical-based approaches need complextraining and are sensitive to training data.
It's apity that almost no linguistic knowledge is usedin these approaches.
The lexicon-basedapproaches seem simplify the word alignmentproblem and can't obtain much translationinformation above word level.
To combine thesetwo approaches in a better way is the directionin near future.
In this paper we proposed amethod to align the bilingual corpus base onchunks.
The linguistic knowledge such as POStag and Chunk tag are used in a simplystatistical model.3 Alignment Algorithm3.1 Outline of AlgorithmFor our procedure in this paper, the bilingualcorpus has been aligned at the sentence l vel,and the English language texts have been taggedwith POS tag, and the Chinese language textshave been segmented and tagged with POS tag.We have available a bilingual lexicon whichlists typical translation for many of the words inthe corpus.
We have available a synonymyChinese dictionary, also.
We identify the chunksof English sentences and then predict he chunkboundaries of Chinese sentences from thetranslation of every English chunks andheuristic information by use of the bilinguallexicon.
The ambiguities of Chinese chunkboundaries are resolved by the coterminouswords in English chunks.
After produce theword candidate sets by statistical method, wecalculate the translation relation probabilitybetween every word pair and select the bestalignment forms.
The detail algorithm for wordalignment is given in table 1.Step 1: According to the definition of Chunk inEnglish, separate the English sentence intoa few chunks and labeled with ordernumber from left to fight.Step 2: Try to find the Chinese translation ofevery English chunk created in step 1 bybilingual dictionary and synonymy Chinesedictionary.
If the Chinese translation is fred,then label the Chinese words with the samenumber used for the English chunk in step1.Step 3: Disambiguate the multi-label Chinesewords by the translation location ofcoterminous words within the same Englishchunk.Step 4: Separate the Chinese sentence into a fewchunks by heuristic information.Step 5: Save all the alignment at chunk level in111whole corpus as a base for word alignment.Step 6: Produce the word candidate sets bystatistical method.Step 7: Calculate the translation relationprobability between every word and it'scandidate translation words.Step 8: Select he best translation by comparingthe total TRP value in different alignmentforms.Table 1.
Outline of Alignment Algorithm3.2 Chunk Identifying of EnglishSentenceFollowing Steven Abney (1991), there are twoseparate stages in chunking parser, which is thechunker and the attacher.
The chunker convertsa stream of words into a stream of chunks, andthe attacher converts the stream of chunks into astream of sentences.
So only the chunker isneeded in this paper.
It's a non-deterministicversion of a LR parser.
For detail about chunkerand the used grammars, please see Abney(1991).
Then the chunks in one sentence arelabeled with order number from left to right.3.3 Chunk Boundary Prediction ofChinese SentenceWe observe the phenomenon that when wetranslate the English sentence to Chinesesentence, all the words in one English chunktend to be translated as one block of Chinesewords that are coterminous.
The word orderswithin these blocks tend to keep with theEnglish chunk, also.
There are three examples infigure 1.
The first sentence pair is chosen froman example sentence of Abney (1991).
Thesecond sentence pair is from a computerhandbook.
In these sentence pair all Englishchunks can find the exactly Chinese Chunk.
Inthe third sentence pair only one English chunkcan't find the exactly Chinese chunk for thissentence is chosen from a story and thetranslation is not literally.In order to find the Chinese translation of everyEnglish chunk, we use the bilingual dictionaryand synonymy Chinese dictionary to implementthe matching.
If the Chinese translation of anywords within the English chunk is found, thenlabel the Chinese word with the same numberused for labeling the English chunk.If there are Chinese words, which are labeledsimultaneously by two or more number ofEnglish chunks, we use the number of nearbyChinese words to disambiguate.
For example, infigure 2, the first Chinese word /~ j  may becorrespondent to the English chunk 5 or 7.
Wehave known that the words in one English chunktend to be translated as one block of Chinesewords that are coterminous, So it's easy todecide the first Chinese word )x~ ffJ iscorrespondent to the English chunk 7, the secondChinese word )x~ ~ is correspondent to theEnglish chunk 5.
By the same way, we can findthe correct ranslations of Chinese word ~and ~ is English chunk 6 and chunk 8respectively.
In Step 4 of figure 2, the Chinesewords with the same label number are bracketedwith in one chunk.
Finally, we separate theChinese sentence into a few chunks by heuristicinformation based on POS tag (especially thepreposition, conjunction, and auxiliary words)and the grammatical knowledge-base ofcontemporary Chinese (Yu shi wen, 1998).\[The b~ald man\] \[was itting\] [on his suitcase\].\[To a c c e ~ _ ~ _ ~ _ ~ c l i c k \ ]  Ion "Su2.p..9.~'l.\[I gathered\] \[from what hey said\] ,\[that an elder sister\] [of his\] \[ was coming \] \[to stay with them\],\[ andthat s h e ~ \ ]  \[ that e v ~\ [~ ' f l ' \ ]~qb\ ] \ [~\ ] \ [~\ ] \ [  - ~ \ ] \ [~\ ] \ [~ l ' \ ]~- -~\ ] ,  \ [~ .R~\ ] \ [~_h\ ] \ [~ l J \ ] .Figure 1.

An Example for Chunk Alignment Algorithm from Step 1 to 43.4 Calculation of Translation RelationProbability for WordsWith the alignments at chunk level of wholecorpus, we propose a Translation RelationProbability (TRP) to implement the wordalignment.
The translation Relation probabilityof words are given by following equation:P~ - L:~ (1)L 'LWhere f?
is the frequency of English word inwhole corpus; fc is the frequency of ChineseWord in whole corpus; f~ is calculated byfollow equation:N /ln( 2Lay ) + ln(Lav)I L~i + Lci(2)Where Lmv is the average words number of allEnglish chunks and all Chinese chunks whichare related to the English word in whole Corpus;L~i is the word number of the English chunk inwhich the English candidate words co-occurwith the Chinese words; ~ is the word numberof the Chinese chunk in which the Englishcandidate words co-occur with the Chinesewords; N is the total number of chunks in whichthe English word co-occur with the Chineseword; 13?e is the penalty value to indicate thePOS change between the Engfish word and theChinese word.By this equation we connect he chunk lengthand POS change with the co-occurrencefrequency.
The less the chunk length, the higherthe translation relation probability.
For example,the chunk pak, which is composed by oneEnglish word and two Chinese words, is morereliable than the chunk pair, which is composedby four English words and four Chinese words.An example is given in figure 3.
There are 5possible alignment forms in our considerationfor this chunk, which includes three Engfishwords and three Chinese words.
Then calculatethe total TRP value for every possible alignmentword pairs in each alignment form by equation(1).
After we get the total TRP value for eachalignment form, we choose the biggest one.floppy disk driveIIIAfloppy disk drive floppy disk driveB Cfloppy disk drive floppy disk driveX1D EFigure 3.

System Architecture1144.2 Experiment ResultsWe tested our system with an English-Chinesebilingual corpus, which is part of a computerhandbook (Sco Unix handbook).
There areabout 2246 English sentence and 2169 Chinesesentence in this computer handbook after filternoisy figures and tables.
Finally we extracted14,214 chunk pairs from the corpus.
Theaccuracy for automatic chunk alignment is85.7%.
The accuracy for word alignment basedon correctly aligned chunk pairs is 93.6%.
Theerrors mainly due to the following reasons:Chinese segmentation error, stop words noise,POS tag error.
The parameter 13ec we used inequation (2) should be chosen from the trainingcorpus.

In this paper, a method for theword alignment of English-Chinese corpusbased on chunks is presented.
After identifiedthe chunks of English sentences, we predict hechunk boundaries of Chinese sentences by thebilingual exicon, synonymy Chinese dictionaryand heuristic information.
The ambiguities ofChinese chunk boundaries are resolved by thecoterminous words in English chunks.
Afterproduce the word candidate sets by statisticalmethod, we calculate the translation relationprobability between every word pair and selectthe best alignment forms.
We evaluate oursystem by real corpus and present the results.Although the results we got are quite promisingto bilingual English Chinese text, there are stillmuch to do in near future.
The corpus we use inour experinaent is a relative small corpus aboutcomputer handbook, in which the terms aretranslated with high consistency.
We shouldextend our method to the large corpus of otherdomains without lost much accuracy.
Toincrease the correct rate of Chinese wordsegmentation is important for our wordalignment.
To extract he corresponding syntaxinformation of English Chinese bilingual corpusby shallow parsing is a direction for future work,also.AcknowledgementsThis research was.
