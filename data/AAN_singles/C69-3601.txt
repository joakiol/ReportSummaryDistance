THE LEXICON: A SYSTEM OF MATRICES OF LEXICAL UNITS ANDTHEIR PROPERTIES ~Harry H. Josselson -Uriel  Weinre ich  /I/~ in d iscuss ing the fact that at onetime many Amer ican scholars rel ied on either the disc ip l ineof psychology or  socio logy for the resolut ion of semanticproblems~ comments:In Soviet lexicology, it seems, neither the tra-d i t ional is ts~ who have been content to work withthe categor ies of c lassical  rhetor ic  and 19th-century histor ical  semantics~ nor the cr i t icallex ico log ists  in search of better conceptual  tools,have ever found reason to doubt that l inguist icsalone is centra l ly  responsible for the investiga-t ion of the vocabulary of languages.
/2/This paper deals with a cer ta in  conceptual  tool, the matrix,which l inguists  can use for organiz ing a lexicon to insurethat words will be descr ibed (coded) with consistency,  thatis~ to insure that quest ions which have been asked aboutcer ta in  words wil l  be asked for all words in the same class,regardless of the fact that they may be more di f f icult  toanswer for some than for others.
The paper wil l  also d i s -cuss cer ta in  new categories~ beyond those of c lass icalrhetoric~ which have been introduced into lexicology.i.
INTRODUCTIONThe research in automatic t rans lat ion brought about bythe int roduct ion of computers into the technology has~The research descr ibed herein has b&en supported by the In-format ion Systems Branch of the Off ice of Naval Research.The present work is an ampl i f icat ion of a paper~ "The Lexicon:A Matr i~ of Le~emes and Their  Propert ies"~ contr ibuted to theConference  on Mathemat ica l  L inguist ics at Budapest -Balatonsza-badi, September 6-i0~ 1968.-i-engendered a change in l inguist ic thinking, techniques, and "output .
The  essence  o f  th i s  change i s  that  vague genera l -izations cast into such phrases as 'words which have thisgeneral meaning are often encountered in these and similarstructures' have been replaced by the precise def in i t ion ofrules and the enumerat ion of complete sets of words def inedby a given property.
Whereas once  it was acceptable to say(e.g., about Russian) that 'certain short forms which aremodals tend to govern a UTO6~ clause', now it is requiredthat: (a) the term 'modal' be defined, either bY cr i ter iaso precise that any modal could be easi ly identif ied, or ifthat is not possible, by a list conta in ing all of the modalsof the language, and (b) the 'certain short forms which aremodals' which actually do govern a UTOOM clause be l ikewiseidentif ied, either by precise criteria, or by a list.Linguist ic research into Russian has led to and willcont inue to yield many discover ies about the language, andthe problem of recording and recal l ing the content of thesediscoveries is not trivial.
A system is required toorganize the information which has been ascertained, sothat this information can be convenient ly  retr ieved whenit is required; such a system is real ized as a lexicon.F i l lmore /3/  has def ined a lexicon as follows:I conceive of a lexicon as a list of minimal lyredundant descr ipt ions of the syntactic, semantic,and phonological  propert ies of lexical items,accompanied by a system ot redundancy rules, thelatter conceivable as a set Of instruct ions onhow to interpret the lexical entries.-2-2.
DESCRIPTION OF THE LEXICONThe steps in the construct ion  of a lexicon may be de-tai led as follows:a) decid ing which words to enter, i.e., the lexical stockb) dec id ing what are the subsets of the le?ical stockc) decid ing what informat ion to code about each subsetd) compi l ing  the informat ione) structur ing the storage of the informationwhere the steps out l ined have interdependencies.
We shalld iscuss each of the steps, especia l ly  in re lat ion to theRuss ian  language.a) The Lexical StockIdeal ly a Russian lexicon should conta in all of the wordsin the Russ ian language, but 'all Russ ian words' is a setwhose contents are not universal ly  agreed upon, since somewords are gradual ly dropped from usage, while others arecont inual ly  being formed and added to the lexical stock.
Thewords to be entered in the lexicon could  be obtained fromex is t ing sources, i .e.
,  lexicons and technical  d ict ionar ies,and be supplemented by neologisms found in wr i t ten works.The lex icographer  must also be alert for new meanings andcontexts  in which 'old' words may appear.b) Subsets of the Lexical StockThe lexical stock of Russ ian may be subdiv ided into wordclasses, i.e., words having certa in  propert ies in common.These propert ies may be morpholog ica l  and/or functional.
InRussian~ nouns are not marked for tense and predicat ives-3-are not marked for the property of animateness; hence theyare in di f ferent word classes.
The subsets may coincidewith those of tradit ional gram_mar, or they may be di f ferentif the grammar to which the lexicographer refers is not thetradit ional one.c) Information to be CodedThe choice of information to be coded in a part icularlexicon is a function of its intended use-- in other words,one should code the information that will be necessary for apart icular purpose or set of purposes, or information thathas a forseeable application.
For example, one of the tasksfor the Wayne State Univers i ty  Machine Trans lat ion group wasto program a routine to group each nominal in a Russ ian sen-tence with its preceding (dependent) modif iers.
This pro-cedure, cal led blocking, requires that the computer -storedlexicon conta in I) word class information for ident i fy ingnominals and modif iers, as well as conjunct ions,  punctuation,and adverbs intervening between the modif iers, and otherword classes, tokens of which mark the boundar ies of ablock; and 2) case, number, and gender information for esta-b l ishing an agreement relat ion between the nominal and thepreceding modif iers.Most exist ing Russian lexicons conta in  the usual morpho-logical information for members of inf lected word classes:person, gender, number, case, animation, paradigm, aspect,etc.. Cer ta in  syntactic informat ion such as impersonal i ty-4-and government of cases, preposit ions,  the infinit ive, andclauses, is indicated for verbal word classes.
This indica-t ion may be expl ic i t  or sometimes only impl ic it  in an ex-ample; it is not consistent.
It is not unusual to chanceupon one of the complements  of a cer ta in  predicat ive underthe entry head of another predicat ive for which the exampleis given.
In the Academy of Sciences d ict ionary /4/, theentry head ~eaenm~ contains the example CTaao BApyF 06~AHOM AocaAHO,  qTO HpMxoAMTCH MFpaT~ TaKy~ He~eny~ pooh.
In  thesame lexicon~ under OOMAH~,  the form OOMBHO is shown togovern a qTO clause in an example; however, under AocaAathere is neither coding nor example to indicate that ~ocanHotakes a qTO clause.Each lexical entry should include all of the ex ist ingphonological ,  morphologica l ,  and syntact ic  in format ion aboutthe head word; the d iscuss ion  and presentat ion  of this in-format ion will entai l  the in t roduct ion  of concepts  fromsemantics and styl ist ics.
When using a Russ ian lexicon, oneshould be able to d iscover whether ~OmHO is a modal (if thegrammar of Russ ian uses the concept 'modal' for the wordclass of which MO~HO is a member) by looking under the entryhead MOXHO and f inding the pos i t ion where the property 'modal'is coded for that word.
Furthermore,  one should be able todetermine whether MOXHO takes an inf in i t ive complement,iwhether if takes a subject, or whether if has a correspondinglong form, etc..S ince the predicate is the sentence fulcrum, i.e., since-5-it contains the most information necessary for analysis ofthe structure of the sentence, the coding of the complementsof predicat ive words is one of the main tasks for the datainput to automatic parsing of Russian sentences.
Machinetranslat ion oriented lexicographers have done a great dealof work in coding the complements of many lexemes, especia l lythe predicatives, in an expl ic i t  and thorough way.lordanskaja /5/ suggested 126 di f ferent complementat ionpatterns to account for the "strong government"  of 7000Russian stems.
She recognized that the meanings of the stemscould be associated with di f ferent patterns; e.g., exe~oBaTbhas the fol lowing meanings with the fol lowing complements:i) 'to go after' with 3a + instr.2) 'to ensue' with H3 + gen.3) 'to be guided by something' with dative without prep.She recommended that the stems with di f ferent meanings betreated as different, and that a model be composed separatelyfor each item.Rakhmankulova /6/ has written 12 models of complementsfor sentences containing any of ten dif ferent German verbsdenoting pos i t ion in space, and she i l lustrates, in amatrix, which verbs can appear in which models.Machine translat ion groups have examined Russ ian textsand from them compi led l ists of nominals and predicat iveswhich take an inf init ive complement or a ~TO or qTOdH clausecomplement~ and lists, of governing modif iers with their-6-complementary  structures~ many of which are not shown inany lexicon.
The Wayne State Univers i ty  group has doneextens ive coding of the complementat ion  of predicat ives(verbs and short form modif iers) ,  modi f iers  (part ic iplesand adject ives which govern complementary  structures),and nouns.
The group has created an auxi l iary d ic t ionarywhich is structured so that every complementat ion  pattern(where the pattern includes an indicat ion of the opt ionalpresence or ob l igatory  absence of a subject) associatedwith each predicat ive in the d ict ionary is wr i t ten out ex-pl icit ly.
For example, the entry for noTpe0OBaTB in thisauxi l iary d ict ionary reads as follows:CAN SUBJECTPATTERN (NOM.
CASE)NUMBER BE PRESENT?yesyesyesyesyesyesyesNOMINAL INF.1 2 3acegengengengenPREP+CASE CLAUSE1 2 qTO qT05~E+dat~o+genO+genyesyesFor t rans lat ion purposes, it wil l  be necessary to indicatethe t rans lat ion(s)  of the predicat iv~ cor respond ing  to eachpattern, as wel l  as those of the prepos i t ions and caseendings in each pattern.
A language example of pat tern  3-7-is Yxe oKo~o HO~y~HS eFo HoTpe6oBa~M K OKO~OTOqHO~o -'AI-ready around midday they summoned him %0 the police.
',whi le pattern 4 is i l lustrated by OT ~McaTeaH M~ noTpe~yeMY.y~oxecTBeHHOR npaB~.

'The above entry may not be complete.
For instance, i%does not show the entry y+gen which ref lects  a phrase inSmi rn i t sky ' s  d ict ionary /7/, Tpe6oBaT5 O6%SCHeHMS y KOF0 -- 'todemand an explanat ion from somebody', which is not shown inthree Russ ian lexicons /8/.
Furthermore, i% can be seenthat the patterns with K+da% can be extended so that thatphrase is replaced by B+aCC or even by an adverbial  ~OMOR-'home'.
New information will always be added.One transformational ist  technique is to specify a syn-tactic construct ion along with a list of (all of the) lexemeswhich can occur in a certa in posi t ion of that construct ion.The set of lexemes which Can be tokens in a certa in pos i t ionof a construct ion is the domain of that const ruct ion  withrespect to the position.
Once a. lexeme is in that domains-the pair cons ist ing of the posit ion and the const ruc t ionbecomes par% of the def in i t ion of that lexeme.
The lexemeis complete ly  def ined by all of the pairs in which it is atoken, and ideal ly the contents of a lexical entry would in-c lude all such pairs.F i l lmore /9/ has compi led a list of Engl ish verbs whichtake a to-phrase complement, i.e.
le~emes which occur in the-8-pos i t ion  VERB of the const ruct ion  SUBJ  + VERB + to-phrase.He is careful  to point out that the to-phrase must funct ionas the complement of the verbs on the list (e.g., agree,endeavor,  hope, want) and not as a purposive adverbial phrase(as with.
'wait '  in 'He waited to see her.'
where 'to' canbe replaced by 'in order to'), since as he states,"Theappearance of purpose adverbial  to-phrases.. ,  does notappear to be statable in terms of contextual  verb type.
"/10/Th is  indicates that the formal construct ion is not alwayssuf f ic ient  to def ine a property, and that the deep structurefunct ion of the const ruct ion  may have to be specif ied aswell.The fact that statements which are formally identicalcan have dist inct deep structures is i l lustrated by thefo l lowing Russ ian language examples, which are not onlyformal ly identical,  but identical  in content except for oneword:N~TB qe~oBe~ 6H~o BH0paHo HaMM.Five persons were elected by us.N~TB qeaoBe~ 6~o B~OpaHo ~eaeFaTaMM.Five persons were e lected as de legates /by the delegates.BSTB qe~oBeE 6N~o BH6paHo pe~epeH~yMoM.Five persons were elected by referendum.In the f irst example, the (pro)noun in the instrumentalcase is the subject of the active transformiMM BHOpaaM HHTB qeaoBeK.We e lected five persons.whi le in the second example, f irst interpretat ion,  the in--9 -strumental  noun remains in the instrumental  case in theactive transform, where (X) stands for some subject:(X) B~paaM n~T~ qea0BeK ~eaeFaTa~M.
(X) elected five people as delegates.The instrumental  noun in the third sentence also remains inthe instrumental  case in the active transform, but is shownto have a di f ferent funct ion from the noun in the secondsentence by the fact that it i s  possible, albeit not ele-gant, to sayNHT5 ueaoBeE ONao BNOpaHo ~eaeraTaMM peCepeH~yMoM.Five people were elected as delegates by referendum.and correspondingly(X) BH~paaM nSTb qeaoBeK ~eaeFaTaMM pe~epeH~yMOM.
"(X) elected five people as delegates by referendum.,i.e.
both words can coexist  in a sentence.Kiefer /i\]/ has shown for Hungar ian that the meaning ofthe verb can change within a given const ruct ion  when thedef in i t ion of the construct ion is formal and does not con-sider semantic propert ies of the components.Penz van nala.He has money on him.i s  contrasted withIPeter van n~la.Peter is with him.where the animate status of the subject d is t ingu ishes  thepossess ive and locational meanings.Lehiste /12/ has shown that the d is t inct ion  between'being' and 'having' in Estonian is one of d i f ferent  comple-ments taken, under special  condit ions,  by the same verb.-i0-AlthoughIsa~ on raamat.Father has (a) book.andLaua l  on  raamat .On the table is (a) book.are structurally identical, since morphologically isal andlaual are both in the adessive case and raamat is in thenominative case, when functional (semantic) case namesare used, isal is dative and laual is locative, whileraama___.___~t is in both sentences in the objective case.As researchers work in the area of discovering andcodifying syntactic properties, they find out that semanticconsiderations are impossible to avoid.
Much of the newwork in lexieology involves the analysis of predicates andtheir arguments (i.e., subjects, and complements such asclauses, noun/adjective phrases, and prepositional phrases).The transition from purely syntactic coding (i.e., specifyingthe complements and their morphological cases if applicable)to semantic coding has been made by Fillmore /13/ with hisgrammatical cases (e.g., agent, instrument, object).d) Compil ing the InformationCompil ing a dictionary entails discovering facts abouta language and arranging these facts in such a way that theymay be conveniently retrieved.
The ,key factor is that oncea statement is made about a certain member of a word Class,all the other menbers of that class must be coded for theway that statement applies to them.
If the statement is"%-ii-?i r relevant for certa in members, it may be desirable to  createa new word class for the latter.A lexicon without lacunae can be compi led by the fo l lowingprocedure: For each word class construct  a matrix such thateach co lumn head is a bit of informat ion pert inent to thisclass, and the row heads are all of the words in this class.Each intersect ion must be f i l led with some code indicat ingwhether or not the word has the property, and the codes ofthe  proper t ies  must be such that  they  a l low the  ent i re  spec-t rma of  poss ib le  answers.
For example ,  s ince  the  Russ ianCHpoxa - 'orphan' - can be feminine or mascul ine,  the gendercode  must  inc lude  a l so  combinat ions  o f  the  bas ic  components(mascu l ine ,  femin ine ,  and neuter ) ;  s ince  the  Russ ian~Hdx~epe~HposaTb --' to  d i f fe rent ia te '  - i s  both  per fec t iveand imper fec t ive ,  the  code fo r  aspect  must compr i se  ent r iesfo r  'per fec t ive ' ,  ' imper fec t ive ' ,  and 'both ' .
When a verbi s  marked 'both ' ,  i t  may be des i rab le  to  spec i fy  the  d i s -t r ibut ion  o f  the aspects  over  meaning and/or  tenses .This matr ix format forces the lexicographer to commithimself  about the way each property appl ies to each memberof the word class.
It precludes the o ld- fash ioned quasi-coding, where the lexicographer coded what he knew andomitted what he did not know or had never thought to con-sider.
In some Russ ian lexicons, certa in nouns were coded forhaving no plural, but the absence of this coding in otherentr ies did not necessar i ly  imply that they did have a-12-plural;  the only inference that could be drawn was thatmost nouns not coded for having no plural did indeed haveone, but this in format ion is not meaningful  when def in i tein format ion about a part icu lar  entry is required.When using the matr ix format, with its demands for con-sistency, one faces the problem of how to get the informat ionto fi l l  its intersect ions.
Natural ly,  if the informat ionis a lready in a dict ionary,  or if the lex icographer  has anexample, from some text, of the phenomenon to be coded, thereis no problem in f i l l ing the intersect ion.
However, if theexample is lacking, this is not always suff ic ient ground forcod ing the non-ex is tence of the proper ty .
Sometimes~ de-spite the absence of an example, the lex icographer  feels thatthe property  holds, and he may consult  with a native informant,us ing the caut ion of fered by Zel l ig  Harr is  /14/:If the l inguist  has in his corpus ax, bx, butnot cx (where a, b, c are e lements with generald is t r ibut iona l  s imilar ity)9 he may wish to checkwith the informant as to whether cx occurs at all.The e l ic i t ing  of forms from an informant has tobe planned with care because of suggest ib i l i tyin certa in  interpersonal  and intercultural  re-lat ions and because it may not always be possiblefor the informant to say whether a form whichis proposed by the l inguist occurs in his language.Rather than const ruct ing  a form cx and askingthe informant 'Do you say cx?'
or the like, thel inguist  can in most cases ask quest ions whichshould lead the informant to use cx if the formoccurs in the informant 's  speech.
At its mostinnocent, e l ic i t ing  consists  of dev is ing situa-t ions in which the form in quest ion  is l ikelyto occur in the informant 's  speech.Work  at Wayne State Univers i ty  on the complementat ionof cer ta in  Russ ian -o forms by qTO/qTOO~ c lauses /15/ sup--13-ports Harris' observation.
The di f f icul t ies of working w i tha native informant became evident when, on dif ferent occasionsthe native accepted and then rejected certain constructions.Sometimes the acceptance depended on the construct ion ofcontexts which eluded the native on the second perusal.The matrix approach is currently being used in Russianlexicon research at Wayne State University, Where the inform-ation in the Academy dict ionary /16/ and in Ushakov /17/is being coded.
~ The omissions and inconsistencies ofpresenting lexical information in the lexicons are discussedin a paper by Alexander Vitek /18/.
Grammatical  prof i leshave been produced for all Russian substantives, adjectives,and verbs, including their der ivat ive part ic iples andgerunds.
The profi les contain primari ly morphologicalproperties, but some syntactic coding, mainly of comple-mentat ion patterns, has also been started.A sample of the coding format developed for Russian verbs(in Ushakov) in this research appears in Figures 1 and 2.In Figure I, the coding form for Russian verb morpho-logy, separate fields are denoted by a single slash mark.Each field has codes for certain morphological  propert iesof the Russian verb.

With respectto the entry heads, they can be stems, canonical  forms, orall of the forms that exist in the language.
Note that acanonical  form could be a part icular  form of a paradigmsuch as the mascul ine singular form of an adject ive or theinf in i t ive form of a verb, or it could be a certa in  verbfrom which other verbs are der ived by certa in  rules.
B innick/19/ has i l lustrated the latter by suggest ing that be couldbe an entry head having, as part of its contents, ~ and-18-make which are the causat ive forms of the locational andex istent ia l  meanings, respectively,  of be.
F i l lmore /20/has ment ioned that str ike and touch di f fer  pr imari ly  onlyin re lat ive intensi ty of impact.
It is interest ing tonote that Hebrew has for some verbs a basic form which isCon jugated through seven 'constructions',  two of which arelabeled 'causative' and ' intensive'.A lex icon whose entry  heads are stems or canonicalforms has the advantage of compactness and the advantagethat the whole paradigm associated with these forms is in-Idicated.
It has the d isadvantage that the user must knowthe rules of der ivat ion in order to look up words which arenot in canonical  form.
If every form in the language is anentry  head, then the lexicon is much longer, but the homo-graphic propert ies  of the word are convenient ly  recorded;one might never realize, using a canonical  for lexicon, thatcea is both the past tense of OeCT~ - 'to sit down' - andthe genit ive plural  of ce~o - 'village' -~ but this propertywould be immediate ly  evident if tea were an entry head.In the Wayne State  Univers i ty  machine translat ion re-search, Russ ian text to be translated or analyzed is 'readin' one sentence at a time; start ing from left to right,segments of the sentence are ' looked up' in order to obta inwhatever  in format ion about them has been stdred in the machinet rans lat ion  lexicon.
The min imum segment is one word; themaximum segment is an ent i re sentence~ no segment is fermi--19-nated inside a ~ord.
The entry heads of the lexicon weredes igned to correspond to the segments, and therefore are~rds  or sequences of words (idioms).
The entry heads couldbe canonical  forms or stems, but this would require automaticprocedures for t ransforming any inf lected form into itscanonical  form, and for f inding the stem of any form in text.Space can be saved in a full form lexicon by enter ing onlyonce~ perhaps under the canonical  form, the informat ionwhich all members of a paradigm share 9 and cross referencingthis informat ion under the related entry heads.
In theWayne State Univers i ty  machine translat ion research~ setsof complementat ion patterns are stored in an auxi l iaryd ict ionary and any set can be referenced by any verbal form.The sequence of entry heads in the lexicon is alphabetical ,since the shape of the text word to be looked up is its onlyidenti f icat ion.
Natural ly,  if the set of Russ ian words couldbe put into a one-to-one correspondence with some subset ofthe posit ive integers by a funct ion whose value on any wordin its domain could be determined only by informat ion de-ducib le from the graphemic structure of that word~ then theentry heads of the lexicon would not have to be in alphabeticiorder; in this case, the lookup would be simpler and faster,s ince the entr ies could be randomly accessed.The number of columns in the matr ix of any word classshould be without limit so that new informat ion can be en-tered.
Similar ly,  the number of rows should be without-20-l imit to al low addit ions as the lexical stock of the lan-guage grows.3.
