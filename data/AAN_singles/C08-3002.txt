This system utilizes a full-form lexicon for morphological analysis,and applies rule-based approaches forpart-of-speech tagging and phrasechunking.
The system follows a novelapproach of performing agreementchecks at phrase and clause levels usingthe grammatical information exhibited byPOS tags in the form of feature valuepairs.
The system can detect and suggestrectifications for a number ofgrammatical errors, resulting from thelack of agreement, order of words invarious phrases etc., in literary stylePunjabi texts.
To the best of ourknowledge, this grammar checkingsystem is the first such system reportedfor Indian languages.1 IntroductionGrammar checking is one of the most widelyused tools within natural language engineeringapplications.
Most of the word processingsystems available in the market incorporatespelling, grammar, and style-checking systemsfor English and other widely used languages.Naber (2003) discussed one such rule-basedgrammar checking system for English.
However,when it comes to the smaller languages,specifically the Indian languages, most of suchadvanced tools have been lacking.

In this article, agrammar checking system for Punjabi has beenprovided.
Punjabi is a member of the ModernIndo-Aryan family of languages.There is an n-gram based grammar checkingsystem for Bangla (Alam et al, 2006).
However,the authors admit that its accuracy is very lowand there is no description about whether thesystem provides any suggestions to correct errorsor not.
However, the system that we discuss herefor Punjabi detects errors and suggestscorrections as well.
While doing so, it providesenough information for the user to understand theerror reason and the suggestions provided, if any.2 PurposeThe purpose of the system is to find variousgrammatical mistakes in the formal texts writtenin Punjabi language.
While detectinggrammatical mistakes, the focus is on keeping thefalse alarms to minimum.
For every detectederror, system provides enough information forthe user to understand why the error is beingmarked.
It also provides suggestions, if possible,to rectify those errors.3 Potential ApplicationsThis system as a whole and its subsystems willfind numerous applications in natural languageprocessing of Punjabi.
Following are some of theapplication areas of this system as a whole or itssubsystems:?
It can be used with various informationprocessing systems for Punjabi, where theinput needs to be corrected grammaticallybefore processing.149?
Parts of this system like morphologicalanalyzer, morphological generator, part-of-speech tagger, phrase chunker etc., willfind use in almost every natural languageprocessing application like machinetranslation, text to speech synthesis, andsearch engines etc., for Punjabi.?
This system as a whole can be used as apost editor for a number of applications forPunjabi like machine translation, opticalcharacter recognition etc., where theoutput needs to be corrected grammaticallybefore providing the end results.?
Second language learners of Punjabi canuse this system as a writing aid to learngrammatical categories operating inPunjabi sentences, and thus improve theirwritings by learning from their mistakes.?
In the word processing field, this systemcan be used for checking essays, formalreports, and letters written in Punjabi.4 System Design & ImplementationThe design of this grammar checking is providedbelow in figure 1.
A sketchy idea of thisproposed design is provided below in terms ofhow the input text is processed to find potentialgrammatical errors.For grammar checking, the input text is firstgiven to a preprocessor, which breaks the inputtext into sentences and then into words.
It alsoperforms filtering, i.e.
marks any phrases, fixedexpressions etc.
in the text.
Then the tokenizedtext is passed on to a morphological analyzer,which uses a full form lexicon to assign eachword its all possible part-of-speech (POS)information (i.e.
POS tags).
Then the text alongwith the POS tags moves on to a POS tagger,which attempts to disambiguate the informationusing hand-written disambiguation rules.
Thenthis POS tagged text is passed on to a phrasechunker, which builds phrases using hand-writtenphrase chunking rules targeted at the POS taginformation.
Phrase chunker also marks clauseboundaries and headwords in noun phrases andclauses.
Then in the last stage, syntax/agreementchecks are performed based on the grammaticalinformation (exhibited by POS tags) at the phraselevel and then at the clause level, using themarked headwords.
Any discrepancy found isreported to the user along with the suggestedcorrections and detailed error information.All the sub activities of this grammar checkingsystem are fully automated and have beendesigned exclusively from scratch as part of thiswork.
No such sub system was available forPunjabi for our use.
All the sub activities havebeen implemented in Microsoft Visual C# 2005and the databases are in XML format withPunjabi text in Unicode.Figure 1.
Punjabi Grammar Checking SystemDesignFor the purpose of morphological analysis,we have divided the Punjabi words into 22 wordclasses depending on the grammaticalinformation required for the words of these wordclasses.
The information that is in the databasedepends upon the word class, like for noun andinflected adjective, it is gender, number, andcase.
As mentioned earlier, all the word forms ofthe commonly used Punjabi words are kept in thelexicon along with their root and othergrammatical information.For part-of-speech tagging, we have deviseda tag set keeping into mind all the grammaticalcategories that can be helpful for agreementchecking.
The tag set is very user friendly andwhile choosing tag names existing tag sets forEnglish and other such languages were taken intoconsideration, like NNMSD ?
masculine,singular, and direct case noun, PNPMPOF ?PreprocessingMorphological AnalysisPart-of-speech TaggingPhrase ChunkingError CheckingOutput text with suggestionsGrammatically incorrect text150masculine, plural, oblique case, and first personpersonal pronoun.
The approach followed forpart-of-speech tagging is rule-based, as there isno tagged corpus for Punjabi available at present.The part-of-speech tagging rules take intoaccount the potential grammatical agreementerrors.For phrase chunking, again a rule-basedapproach was selected.
The tag set that is beingused for phrase chunking includes tags like NPD?
noun phrase in direct case, NPNE ?
nounphrase followed by ?
ne etc.
The rules for phrasechunking take into account the potential errors inthe text, like lack of agreement in words of apotential phrase.In the last phase i.e.
error checking, there aremanually designed error detection rules to detectpotential errors in the text and providecorrections to resolve those errors.
For example,rule to check modifier and noun agreement, willgo through all the noun phrases in a sentence tocheck if the modifiers of those sentences agreewith their respective headwords (noun/pronoun)in terms of gender, number, and case or not.
Forthis matching, the grammatical information fromthe tags of modifiers and headwords is used.
Insimple terms, it will compare the grammaticalinformation (gender, number, and case) ofmodifier with the headword (noun/pronoun) anddisplays an error message if some grammaticalinformation fails to match.
To resolve this error,the error checking module will usemorphological generator to generate the correctform (based on headword?s gender, number, andcase) for that modifier from its root word.For example, consider the grammaticallyincorrect sentence   sohne larkajanda hai ?handsome boy goes?.
In this sentence,in the noun phrase sohne larka?handsome boy?, the modifier  sohne?handsome?
(root word ?
 sohna?handsome?
), with masculine gender, pluralnumber, and direct case, is not in accordancewith the gender, number, and case of itsheadwordlarka ?boy?.
It should be insingular number instead of plural.
The grammarchecking module will detect this as an error as?number?
for modifier and headword is not same,then it will use morphological generator togenerate the ?singular number form?
from its rootword, which is same as root form i.e.
 sohna?handsome?
(masculine gender, singular number,and direct case).
So, the input sentence will becorrected as   sohna larka jandahai ?handsome boy goes?.5 Sample Input and OutputThis section provides some sample Punjabisentences that were given as input to the Punjabigrammar checking system along with the outputgenerated by this system.
Input/Output specifythe input Punjabi sentence and the outputproduced by this grammar checking systemrespectively.Sentence 1This sentence shows the grammatical errorsrelated to ?Modifier and noun agreement?
and?Order of the modifiers of a noun in nounphrase?.
In this sentence noun islarka ?boy?and its modifiers are    sohni ekbhajji janda ?handsome one running?.Input:   Input1: sohni ek bhajji janda larka aaeyaInput2: Handsome one running boy cameOutput:   Output1: ek bhajjia janda sohna larka aaeyaOutput2: One running handsome boy cameSentence 2This sentence covers the grammatical errorrelated to ?Subject and verb agreement?.
Subjectis  barish ?rain?
and verb phrase is   ho riha han ?is raining?.Input:     Input1: bahr barish ho riha hanInput2: It is raining outsideOutput:     Output1: bahr barish ho rahi haiOutput2: It is raining outside6 Testing & EvaluationThe evaluation results for our morphologicalanalyzer shows that it provides correct analysisfor 87.64% words.
This evaluation wasperformed on a corpus of 8 million Punjabiwords.
The part-of-speech tagger reports anaccuracy of 80.29% when applied on a randomlyselected corpus of 25,000 words.
This accuracyimproves to 88.86% if we exclude unknown151words from evaluation results, the reason beingthe absence of an unknown word guesser in ourpart-of-speech tagger.
The phrase chunker reportsaverage precision of 81.18%, recall of 85.07%,and F-measure of 83.07%.
These results includeevaluation performed on 100 sentences for noun,adjective, and verb phrases.
On randomlyselected 1,000 sentences, this grammar checkingsystem reports precision of 76.79%, recall of87.08%, and F-measure of 81.61%.The grammatical errors covered by this systemincludes ?
modifier and noun agreement,subject/object and verb agreement, order ofmodifiers in a noun phrase, order of words in averb phrase, use of contractions etc.
In its presentstate, the system may generate some false alarmsfor complex and compound sentences.
We willwork to reduce these false alarms in the future.Comparison with existing systemsOur system covers a different class of errors andresults for grammar checking systems forEnglish, Swedish etc.
are reported for differenterror sets, with only some errors covered beingcommon.
Some of the systems that are to someextent close to our system in terms of errorscovered are provided here for comparison.
Agrammar checker for German (Schmidt-Wigger,1998) using pattern matching rules reports 81%precision and 57%.
A system for Korean (Young-Soog, 1998) reports 99.05% precision and95.98% recall.
Another system for German(Fliedner, 2002) reports precision and recall of67% for only noun phrase agreement.
A grammarchecker for Bangla (Alam et al, 2006) reportsaccuracy of 53.7% using manual POS taggingand 38% for automated POS tagging.
Whencompared with these systems, 76.79% precisionand 87.08% recall of our grammar checker seamsreasonably good.7 ConclusionsThis article presented design and implementationdetails of the grammar checking system forPunjabi.
This grammar checking system iscapable of detecting various grammatical errorsin formal Punjabi texts.
To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first such system forPunjabi and other Indian languages.
We hope thatthis research work will attempt to narrow downthe gap that exists between Punjabi and othernatural languages in the natural languageprocessing field.
We are confident that thisresearch work will motivate future researchers indeveloping various advanced resources forPunjabi.
This article presented a novel approachfor performing grammar checking using phraseand clause level information coupled withgrammatical information (POS information) inthe form of feature values.
This approach can beapplied for languages that lack advancedresources like full parser, and pattern-matchingapproaches are not competent enough to detectdifferent agreement errors.The web-based version of this grammarchecking is available for free use along with threeother resources for the Punjabi language ?morphological analyzer, part-of-speech tagger,and phrase chunker.
Morphological analyzer isalso available as free download for non-commercial use.ReferencesAlam, Md.
