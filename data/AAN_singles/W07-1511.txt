With the help ofcomputational tools, the bi-gram and n-gramcollocations corresponding to 3,643 head-words are manually identified.
Furthermore,annotations for bi-gram collocations includedependency relation, chunking relation andclassification of collocation types.
Currently,the collocation bank annotated 23,581 bi-gram collocations and 2,752 n-gram colloca-tions extracted from  a 5-million-word corpus.Through statistical analysis on the collocationbank, some characteristics of Chinese bi-gram collocations are examined which is es-sential to collocation research, especially forChinese.1 IntroductionCollocation is a lexical phenomenon in which twoor more words are habitually combined and com-monly used in a language to express certain seman-tic meaning.
For example, in Chinese, people willsay ??-??
(historical baggage) rather than ??
-??
(historical luggage) even though ??
(baggage) and ??
(luggage) are synonymous.However, no one can argue why ??
must collo-cate with??.
Briefly speaking, collocations arefrequently used word combinations.
The collocatedwords always have syntactic or semantic relationsbut they cannot be generated directly by syntacticor semantic rules.
Collocation can bring out differ-ent meanings a word can carry and it plays an in-dispensable role in expressing the most appropriatemeaning in a given context.
Consequently, colloca-tion knowledge is widely employed in natural lan-guage processing tasks such as word sense disam-biguation, machine translation, information re-trieval and natural language generation (Manninget al 1999).Although the importance of collocation is wellknown, it is difficult to compile a complete collo-cation dictionary.
There are some existing corpuslinguistic researches on automatic extraction ofcollocations from electronic text (Smadja 1993;Lin 1998; Xu and Lu 2006).
These techniques aremainly based on statistical techniques and syntacticanalysis.
However, the performances of automaticcollocation extraction systems are not satisfactory(Pecina 2005).
A problem is that collocations areword combinations that co-occur within a shortcontext, but not all such co-occurrences are truecollocations.
Further examinations is needed tofilter out pseudo-collocations once co-occurredword pairs are identified.
A collocation bank withtrue collocations annotated is naturally an indis-pensable resource for collocation research.
(Koshoet al 2000) presented their works of collocationannotation on Japanese text.
Also, the Turkishtreebank, (Bedin 2003) included collocation anno-tation as one step in its annotation.
These two col-location banks provided collocation identificationand co-occurrence verification information.
(Tutin2005) used shallow analysis based on finite statetransducers and lexicon-grammar to identify andannotate collocations in a French corpus.
This col-location bank further provided the lexical functionsof the collocations.
However to this day, there isno reported Chinese collocation bank available.61In this paper, we present the design and con-struction of a Chinese collocation bank (acrony-med CCB).
This is the first attempt to build alarge-scale Chinese collocation bank as a ChineseNLP resource with multiple linguistic informationfor each collocation including:  (1) annotating thecollocated words for each given headword; (2) dis-tinguishing n-gram and bi-gram collocations forthe headword; (3) for bi-gram collocations, CCBprovides their syntactic dependencies, chunkingrelation and classification of collocation typeswhich is proposed by (Xu and Lu 2006).
In addi-tion, we introduce the quality assurance mecha-nism used for CCB.
CCB currently contains for3,643 common headwords taken from ?The Dic-tionary of Modern Chinese Collocations?
(Mei1999) with 23,581 unique bi-gram collocations and2,752 unique n-gram collocations extracted from afive-million-word segmented and chunked Chinesecorpus (Xu and Lu, 2005).The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2 presents some basic concepts.
Section 3describes the annotation guideline.
Section 4 de-scribes the practical issues in the annotation proc-ess including corpus preparation, headword prepa-ration, annotation flow, and the quality assurancemechanism.
Section 5 gives current status of CCBand characteristics analysis of the annotated collo-cations.
Section 6 concludes this paper.2 Basic ConceptsAlthough collocations are habitual expressions innatural language use and they can be easily under-stood by people, a precise definition of collocationis still far-reaching (Manning et al 1999).
In thisstudy, we define a collocation as a recurrent andconventional expression of two or more contentwords that holds syntactic and semantic relation.Content words in Chinese include noun, verb, ad-jective, adverb, determiner, directional word, andgerund.
Collocations with only two words arecalled bi-gram collocations and others are called n-gram collocations.From a linguistic view point, collocations have anumber of characteristics.
Firstly, collocations arerecurrent as they are of habitual use.
Collocationsoccur frequently in similar contexts and they ap-pear in certain fixed patterns.
However, they can-not be described by the same set of syntactic orsemantic rules.
Secondly, free word combinationswhich can be generated by linguistic rules arenormally considered compositional.
In contrast,collocations should be limited compositional(Manning et al 1999) and they usually carry addi-tional meanings when used as a collocation.Thirdly, collocations are also limited substitutableand limited modifiable.
Limited substitutable heremeans that a word cannot be freely substituted byother words with similar linguistic functions in thesame context such as synonyms.
Also, many collo-cations cannot be modified freely by adding modi-fiers or through grammatical transformations.Lastly, collocations are domain-dependent (Smadja1993) and language-dependent.3 Annotation Guideline DesignThe guideline firstly determines the annotationstrategy.
(1) The annotation of CCB follows the head-word-driven strategy.
The annotation uses selectedheadwords as the starting point.
In each circle, thecollocations corresponding to one headword areannotated.
Headword-driven strategy makes amore efficient annotation as it is helpful to estimateand compare the relevant collocations.
(2) CCB is manually annotated with the help ofautomatic estimation of computational features, i.e.semi-automatic software tools are used to generateparsing and chunking candidates and to estimatethe classification features.
These data are present tothe annotators for determination.
The use of assis-tive tools is helpful to produce accurate annota-tions with efficiency.The guideline also specifies the information tobe annotated and the labels used in the annotation.For a given headword, CCB annotates both bi-gram collocations and n-gram collocations.
Con-sidering the fact that n-gram collocations consist-ing of continuous significant bi-grams as a wholeand, the n-gram annotation is based on the identifi-cation and verification of bi-gram word combina-tions and is prior to the annotation of bi-gram col-locations.For bi-gram annotation, which is the major in-terest  in collocation research, three kinds of in-formation are annotated.
The first one is the syn-tactic dependency of the headword and its co-wordin a bi-gram collocation .
A syntactic dependencynormally consists of one word as the governor (orhead), a dependency type and another word serves62as dependent (or modifier) (Lin 1998).Totally, 10types of dependencies are annotated in CCB.
Theyare listed in Table 1 below.Dependency Description ExampleADA Adjective and its adverbial modifier ?
?/d ?
?/a  greatly painfulADV Predicate and its adverbial modifier inwhich the predicate serves as head?
?/ad ?
?/v heavily strikeAN Noun and its adjective modifier ?
?/a ?
?/n lawful incomingCMP Predicate and its complement in whichthe predicate serves as head??/v?
?/v ineffectively treatNJX Juxtaposition structure ??/a?
?/a fair and reasonableNN Noun and its nominal modifier ?
?/n ?
?/n personal safetySBV Predicate and its subject ?
?/n ?
?/v property transferVO Predicate and its object in which thepredicate serves as head?
?/v ?
?/n change mechanismVV Serial verb constructions which indi-cates that there are serial actions?
?/v ?
?/v trace and reportOT OthersTable 1.
The dependency categoriesThe second one is the syntactic chunking informa-tion (a chunk is defined as a minimum non-nestingor non-overlapping phrase) (Xu and Lu, 2005).Chunking information identifies all the words for acollocation within the context of an enclosedchunk.
Thus, it is a way to identify its proper con-text at the most immediate syntactic structure.
11types of syntactic chunking categories given in (Xuand 2006) are used as listed in Table 2.Description ExamplesBNP Base noun phrase [?
?/n ?
?/n]NP     market economyBAP Base adjective phrase  [??/a?

?/nr?/n]BNZ The Nobel PrizeBSV S-V structure [?

?/a]BSV  territorial integrityTable 2.
The chunking categoriesThe third one is the classification of collocationtypes.
Collocations cover a wide spectrum of ha-bitual word combinations ranging from idioms tofree word combinations.
Some collocations arevery rigid and some are more flexible.
(Xu and Lu2006) proposed a scheme to classify collocationsinto four types according to the internal associationof collocations including compositionality, non-substitutability, non-modifiability, and statisticalsignificance.
They are,Type 0: Idiomatic CollocationType 0 collocations are fully non-compositionalas its meaning cannot be predicted from the mean-ings of its components such as????
(climbinga tree to catch a fish, which is a metaphor for afruitless endeavour).
Some terminologies are alsoType 0 collocations such as ?
?
(Blue-tooth )which refers to a wireless communication protocol.Type 0 collocations must have fixed forms.
Theircomponents are non-substitutable and non-modifiable allowing no syntactic transformationand no internal lexical variation.
This type of col-locations has very strong internal associations andco-occurrence statistics is not important.Type 1: Fixed CollocationType 1 collocations are very limited composi-tional with fixed forms which are non-substitutableand non-modifiable.
However, this type can becompositional.
None of the words in a Type 1 col-location can be substituted by any other words toretain the same meaning such as in?
?/n ??
?/n (diplomatic immunity).
Finally, Type 1 colloca-tions normally have strong co-occurrence statisticsto support them.Type 2: Strong CollocationType 2 collocations are limitedly compositional.They allow very limited substitutability.
In otherwords, their components can only be substituted byfew synonyms and the newly generated word com-binations have similar meaning, e.g., ?
?/v ?
?/n (alliance formation) and ?
?/v ?
?/n (allianceformation).
Furthermore, Type 2 collocations al-low limited modifier insertion and the order ofcomponents must be maintained.
Type2 colloca-tions normally have strong statistical support.Type 3: Loose CollocationType 3 collocations have loose restrictions.They are nearly compositional.
Their componentsmay be substituted by some of their synonyms andthe newly generated word combinations usuallyhave very similar meanings.
Type 3 collocationsare modifiable meaning that they allow modifierinsertions.
Type 3 collocations have weak internalassociations and they must have statistically sig-nificant co-occurrence.The classification represents the strength of in-ternal associations of collocated words.
The anno-tation of these three kinds of information is essen-tial to all-rounded characteristic analysis of collo-cations.634 Annotation of CCB4.1 Data PreparationCCB is based on the PolyU chunk bank (Xu andLu, 2005) which contains chunking information onthe People?s Daily corpus with both segmentationand part-of-speech tags.
The accuracies of wordsegmentation and POS tagging are claimed to behigher than 99.9% and 99.5%, respectively (Yu etal.
2001).
The use of this popular and accurate rawresource helped to reduce the cost of annotationsignificantly, and ensured maximal sharing of ouroutput.The set of 3, 643 headwords are selected from?The Dictionary of Modern Chinese Collocation?
(Mei 1999) among about 6,000 headwords in thedictionary.
The selection  was based both on thejudgment by linguistic experts as well as the statis-tical information that they are commonly used.4.2 Corpus PreprocessingThe CCB annotations are represented in XML.Since collocations are practical word combinationsand word is the basic unit in collocation research, apreprocessing module is devised to transfer thechunked sentences in the PolyU chunk bank toword sequences with the appropriate labels to indi-cate the corresponding chunking information.
Thispreprocessing module indexes the words andchunks in the sentences and encodes the chunkinginformation of each word in two steps.
Considerthe following sample sentence extracted from thePolyU chunk bank:??/v[??/n??/n]BNP?/u[??/n??/n?
?/an ]BNP(ensure life and property safety of the people)The first step in preprocessing is to index eachword and the chunk in the sentence by giving in-cremental word ids and chunk ids from left to right.That is,,[W1]?
?/v [W2]?
?/n [W3]?
?/n [W4]?/u[W5]?
?/n [W6]?
?/n [W7]?
?/an [C1]BNP [C2]BNPwhere, [W1] to [W7] are the words and [C1] to [C2]are chunks although chunking positions are notincluded in this step.
One Chinese word may occurin a sentence for more than one times, the uniqueword ids are helpful to avoid ambiguities in thecollocation annotation on these words.The second step is to represent the chunking in-formation of each word.
Chunking boundary in-formation is labeled by following initial/final rep-resentation scheme.
Four labels, O/B/I/E, are usedto mark the isolated words outsides any chunks,chunk-initial words, words in the middle of chunks,and chunk-final words, respectively.
Finally, a la-bel H is used to mark the identified head of chunksand N to mark the non-head words.The above sample sentence is then transferred toa sequence of words with labels as shown below,<labeled> [W1][O_O_N][O]?
?/v [W2][B_BNP_N][C1]?
?/n [W3][E_BNP_H][C1]?
?/n [W4][O_O_N][O]?/u[W5][B_BNP_N][C2]?
?/n [W6][I_BNP_N][C2]??/n[W7][E_BNP_N][C2]?
?/an </labeled>For each word, the first label is the word ID.
Thesecond one is a hybrid tag for describing its chunk-ing status.
The hybrid tags are ordinal with respectto the chunking status of boundary, syntactic cate-gory and head, For example, B_BNP_N indicatesthat current word is the beginning or a BNP andthis word is not the head of this chunk.
The thirdone is the chunk ID if applicable.
For the word outof any chunks, a fixed chunk ID O is given.4.3 Collocation AnnotationCollocation annotation is conducted on one head-word at a time.
For a given headword, an annota-tors examines its context to determine if its co-occurred word(s) forms a collocation with it and ifso, also annotate the collocation?s dependency,chunking and classification information.
The anno-tation procedure, requires three passes.
We use aheadword ?
?/an (safe), as an illustrative exam-ple.Pass 1.
Concordance and dependency identifica-tionIn the first pass, the concordance of the givenheadword is performed.
Sentences containing theheadwords are obtained, e.g.S1: ?
?/v [?
?/v  ?
?/an]BVP  ?/u  ?
?/n(follow the principles for ensuring the safety)S2: ?
?/v [?
?/n ?
?/n]BNP ?/u[?
?/n ?
?/n ?
?/an]BNP(ensure life and property safety of people)S3: ?
?/v  ?
?/ns  [?
?/an  ?
?/v]BVP(ensure the flood pass through Yangzi River safely)With the help of an automatic dependency pars-er, the annotator determines all syntactically andsemantically dependent words in the chunking con-text of the observing headword.
The annotationoutput of S1 is given below in which XML tags areused for the dependency annotation.S1:<sentence>?
?/v [?
?/v  ?

?/n64<labeled> [W1][O_O_N][O]?
?/v [W2][B_BVP_H][C1]?

?/an has direct dependency, and in S3, such a de-pendency does not exist as?
?/v only determines?
?/v and ?
?/an depends on ??/v.
The qual-ity of CCB highly depends on the accuracy of de-pendency annotation.
This is very important foreffective characteristics analysis of collocationsand for the collocation extraction algorithms.Pass 2.
N-gram collocations annotationIt is relatively easy to identify n-gram colloca-tions since an n-gram collocation is of habitual andrecurrent use of a series of bi-grams.
This meansthat n-gram collocations can be identified by find-ing consecutive occurrence of significant bi-gramsin certain position.
In the second pass, the annota-tors focus on the sentences where the headwordhas more than one dependency.
The percentage ofall appearances of each dependent word at eachposition around the headword is estimated with thehelp of a program (Xu and Lu, 2006).
Finally,word dependencies frequently co-occurring in con-secutive positions in a fixed order are extracted asn-gram collocations.For the headword, an n-gram collocation??/n?
?
/n ?
?
/an is identified since the co-occurrence percentage of dependency??/-NN-?
?/an and dependency??/n-NN-?
?/an is 0.74is greater than a empirical threshold suggest in (Xuand Lu, 2006).
This n-gram is annotated in S2 asfollows:<ncolloc observing="?
?/an" w1="?
?/n" w2="??/n"w3="?
?/an" start_wordid="5"> </ncolloc>where,-<ncolloc> indicates an n-gram collocation-w1, w2,..wn give the components of the n-gramcollocation according to the ordinal sequence.-start_wordid  indicates the word id of the firstcomponent of the n-gram collocation.Since n-gram collocation is regarded as a whole,its internal dependencies are ignored in the outputfile of pass 2.
That is, if the dependencies of sev-eral components are associated with an n-gramcollocation in one sentence, the n-gram collocationis annotated and these dependencies are filtered outso as not to disturb the bi-gram dependencies.Pass 3.
Bi-gram collocations annotationIn this pass, all the word dependencies are ex-amined to identify bi-gram collocations.
Further-more, if a dependent word combination is regardedas a collocation by the annotators, it will be furtherlabeled based on the type determined.
The identifi-cation is based on expert knowledge combinedwith the use of several computational features asdiscussed in (Xu and Lu, 2006).An assistive tool is developed to estimate thecomputational features.
We use the program to ob-tain feature data based on two sets of data.
Thefirst data set is the annotated dependencies in the5-million-word corpus which is obtained throughPass 1 and Pass 2 annotations.
Because the de-pendent word combinations are manually identi-fied and annotated in the first pass, the statisticalsignificance is helpful to identify whether the wordcombination is a collocation and to determine itstype.
However, data sparseness problem must beconsidered since 5-million-word is not largeenough.
Thus, another set of statistical data are65collected from a 100-million segmented and taggedcorpus (Xu and Lu, 2006).
With this large corpus,data sparseness is no longer a serious problem.
But,the collected statistics are quite noisy since theyare directly retrieved from text without any verifi-cation.
By analyzing the statistical features fromboth sets, the annotator can use his/her professionaljudgment to determine whether a bi-gram is a col-location and its collocation type.In the example sentences, two collocations areidentified.
Firstly, ?
?/an ?
?/v is classified as aType 1 collocation as they have only one peak co-occurrence, very low substitution ratio and theirco-occurrence order nearly never altered.
Secondly,?
?/v ?
?/an is identified as a collocation.
Theyhave frequent co-occurrences and they are alwaysco-occurred in fixed order among the verified de-pendencies.
However, their co-occurrences are dis-tributed evenly and they have two peak co-occurrences.
Therefore, ?
?/v ?
?/an is classi-fied as a Type 3 collocation.
These bi-gram collo-cations are annotated as illustrated below,<bcolloc observing="?
?/an" col="?
?/v" head="?
?/v" type= "1" relation="ADV"><dependency no="1" observing="?
?/an" head="?

In the first annotationstage, 20% headwords of the whole set was anno-tated in duplicates by all three of them.
Their out-puts were checked by a program.
Annotated collo-cation including classified dependencies and typesaccepted by at least two annotators are reserved inthe final data as the Golden Standard while theothers are considered incorrect.
The inconsisten-cies between different annotators were discussed toclarify any misunderstanding in order to come upwith the most appropriate annotations.
In the sec-ond annotation stage, 80% of the whole annota-tions were then divided into three parts and sepa-rately distributed to the annotators with 5% dupli-cate headwords were distributed blindly.
The du-plicate annotation data were used to estimate theannotation consistency between annotators.5 Collocation Characteristic Analysis5.1 Progress and Quality of CCBUp to now, the first version of CCB is completed.We have obtained 23,581 unique bi-gram colloca-tions and 2,752 unique n-gram collocations corre-sponding to the 3,643 observing headwords.Meanwhile, their occurrences in the corpus are an-notated and verified.
With the help of a computerprogram, the annotators manually classified bi-gram collocations into three types.
The numbers ofType 0/1, Type 2 and Type 3 collocations are 152,3,982 and 19,447, respectively.For the 3,643 headwords in The Dictionary ofModern Chinese Collocations (Mei 1999) with35,742 bi-gram collocations,  20,035 collocationsappear in the corpus.
We call this collection asMei?s Collocation Collection (MCC).
There are19,967 common entries in MCC and CCB, whichmeans 99.7% collocations in MCC appear in CCBindicating a good linguistic consistency.
Further-more, 3,614 additional collocations are found inCCB which enriches the static collocation diction-ary.5.2 Dependencies Numbers Statistics of Col-locationsFirstly, we study the statistics of how many typesof dependencies a bi-gram collocation may have.The numbers of dependency types with respect todifferent collocation types are listed in Table 3.Collocations 1 type 2 types >2 types TotalType 0/1 152 0 0 152Type 2 3970 12 0 3982Type 3 17282 2130 35 19447Total 21404 2142 35 23581Table 3.
Collocation classification versus numberof dependency types66It is observed that about 90% bi-gram collocationshave only one dependency type.
This indicates thata collocation normally has only one fixed syntacticdependency.
It is also observed that about 10% bi-gram collocations have more than one dependencytype, especially Type 3 collocations.
For example,two types of dependencies are identified in the bi-gram collocation ??/an-??/n.
They are ??/an-AN-?
?/n (a safe nation) which indicates thedependency of a noun and its nominal modifierwhere ?
?/n serves as the head, and??/n-NN-??
/an (national security) which indicates thedependency of a noun and its nominal modifierwhere ?
?/an serves as the head.
It is attributed tothe fact that the use of Chinese words is flexible.
AChinese word may support different part-of-speech.A collocation with different dependencies resultsin different distribution trends and most of thesecollocations are classified as Type 3.
On the otherhand, Type 0/1 and Type 2 collocations seldomhave more than one dependency type.5.3 Syntactic Dependency Statistics of Collo-cationsThe statistics of the 10 types of syntactic depend-encies with respect to different types of bi-gramcollocations are shown in Table 4.

The statistics of collocations with dif-ferent collocation type and dependencyCorresponding to 23,581 bi-gram collocations,25,793 types of dependencies are identified (somecollocations have more than one types of depend-ency).
In which, about 82% belongs to five majordependency types.
They are AN, VO, NN, ADV andSBV.
It is note-worthy that the percentage of NNcollocation is much higher than that in English.This is because nouns are more often used in paral-lel to serve as one syntactic component in Chinesesentences than in English.The percentages of Type 0/1, Type 2 and Type 3collocations in CCB are 0.6%, 16.9% and 82.5%,respectively.
However, the collocations with dif-ferent types of dependencies have shown their owncharacteristics with respect to different collocationtypes.
The collocations with CMP, NJX and NNdependencies on average have higher percentage tobe classified into Type 0/1 and Type 2 collocations.This indicates that CMP, NJX and NN collocationsin Chinese are always used in fixed patterns andthese kinds of collocations are not freely modifi-able and substitutable.
In the contrary, many ADVand AN collocations are classified as Type 3.
Thisis partially due to the special usage of auxiliarywords in Chinese.
Many AN Chinese collocationscan be inserted by a meaningless auxiliary word?/u and many ADV Chinese collocations can be in-serted by an auxiliary word?/u.
This means thatmany AN and ADV collocations can be modifiedand thus, they always have two peak co-occurrences.
Therefore, they are classified as Type3 collocations.
7.7% and 62.5% of the collocationswith dependency OT are classified as Type 0/1 andType2 collocations, respectively.
Such percentagesare much higher than the average.
This is attributedby the fact that some Type 0/1 and Type 2 colloca-tions have strong semantic relations rather thansyntactic relations and thus their dependencies aredifficult to label.5.4 Chunking Statistics of CollocationsThe chunking characteristic for the collocationswith different types and different dependencies areexamined.
In most cases, Type 0/1/2 collocationsco-occur within one chunk or between neighboringchunks.
Therefore, their chunking characteristicsare not discussed in detail.
The percentage of theoccurrences of Type 3 collocations with differentchunking distances are given in Table 5.
If a collo-cation co-occurs within one chunk, the chunkingdistance is 0.
If a collocation co-occurs betweenneighboring chunks, or between neighboring words,or between a word and a neighboring chunk, thechunking distance is 1, and so on.67ADA ADV AN CMP NJX NN SBV VO VV OT0 chunk 56.8 53.1 65.7 48.5 70.2 62.4 46.5 41.1 47.2 86.41 chunk 38.2 43.7 28.5 37.2 15.4 27.9 41.2 35.7 41.1 13.52 chunks 5.0 3.2 3.7 14.2 14.4 9.7 11.0 17.6 9.6 0.1>2chunks 0.0 0.0 2.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 1.3 5.6 2.1 0.0Table 5.
Chunking distances of Type 3 collocationsIt is shown that the co-occurrence of collocationsdecreases with increased chunking distance.
Yet,the behavior for decrease is different for colloca-tions with different dependencies.
Generally speak-ing, the ADA, ADV, CMP, NJX, NN and OT collo-cations seldom co-occur cross two words or twochunks.
Furthermore, the occurrences of AN, NJXand OT collocations quickly drops when thechunking distance is greater than 0, i.e.
these col-locations tends to co-occur within the same chunk.In the contrary, the co-occurrences of ADA, ADV,CMP, SBV and VV collocations corresponding tochunking distance equals 0 and 1 decrease steadily.It means that these four kinds of collocations aremore evenly distributed within the same chunk orbetween neighboring words or chunks.
The occur-rences of VO collocations corresponding to chunk-ing distance from 0 to 3 with a much flatter reduc-tion.
This indicates that a verb may govern its ob-ject in a long range.6 ConclusionsThis paper describes the design and construction ofa manually annotated Chinese collocation bank.Following a set of well-designed annotation guide-line, the collocations corresponding to 3,643headwords are identified from a chunked five-million word corpus.
2,752 unique n-gram colloca-tions and 23,581 unique bi-gram collocations areannotated.
Furthermore, each bi-gram collocationis annotated with its syntactic dependency informa-tion, classification information and chunking in-formation.
Based on CCB, characteristics of collo-cations with different types and different depend-encies are examined.
The obtained result is essen-tial for improving research related to Chinese col-location.
Also, CCB may be used as a standard an-swer set for evaluating the performance of differ-ent collocation extraction algorithms.
In the future,collocations of all unvisited headwords will be an-notated to produce a complete 5-million-word Chi-nese collocation bank.AcknowledgementThis research is supported by The Hong KongPolytechnic University (A-P203), CERG Grant(5087/01E) and Chinese University of Hong Kongunder the Direct Grant Scheme project (2050330)and Strategic Grant Scheme project (4410001).ReferencesBedin N. et al 2003.
