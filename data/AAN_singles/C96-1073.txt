In this pa-per, we extend the unification based ap-proach to cases which are often seen asa test-bed for focus theory: utteranceswith multiple focus operators and secondoccurrence xpressions.
We then showthat the resulting analysis favourablycompares with two prominent theories offocus (namely, Rooth's Alternative Se-mantics and Krifka's Structured Meanoings theory) in that it correctly gener-ates interpretations which these alter-native theories cannot yield.
Finally,we discuss the formal properties of theapproach and argue that even thoughHOU need not terminate, for the classof unification-problems dealt with in thispaper, HOU avoids this shortcoming andis in fact computationally tractable.1 In t roduct ionIn this paper, we argue that Higher Order Uni-fication (HOU) provides a linguistically adequatetool for modeling the semantics of focus.
Buildingup on (Pulman, 1995), we develop a unification-based analysis of focus which we show favourablycompares with two prominent heories of focus,Rooth's Alternative Semantics and Krifka's Struc-tured Meanings theory.
For data which is gener-ally viewed as a test-bed for focus theory (utter-ances with multiple focus operators and secondoccurrence xpressions), we show that contraryto Rooth's and Krifka's theories, the HOU treat-ment yields a transparent analysis while avoidingunder- and over-generation.Focus is a much debated notion.
In this paper, weassume a simplifed version of Jackendoff's defini-tion: a focus is the semantic value of a prosodi-tally prominent element.
We take the identifica-tion of prosodically prominent elements as given.To set the stage for this paper, we will brieflyreview the folklore, i.e.
the main issues of fo-cus theory.
It is commonly agreed that focustriggers the formation of an additional seman-tic value which we will call the Focus Seman-t ic Value (FSV).
The name and definition ofthe FSV varies from author to author: Jackend-off (Jackendoff, 1972) calls it the presuppositionalset, Rooth (Rooth, 1992) the Alternative Sct andKrifka (Krifka, 1992) the Ground.
In this paper,we assume a definition of the FSV which is inessence Rooth's Alternative set, that is, tile setof semantic objects obtained by making an ap-propriate substitution in the focus position.
Forinstance, the FSV of (la) is defined as (lb), theset of properties of the form like-lug y where y isan individual (in what follows, focus is indica~tedusing upper-case; we also follow Montague's con-vention that for any type % D~ is the set of objectsof type r and wff~ is the set of wits of type r).
(1) a. Jon only likes MARYb.
lycIt is also usuMly agreed that certain linguis-tic elements assoc iate  w i th  focus in that themeaning of the utterance containing these ele-ments varies depending on the choice of focus.
Forinstance in (2a-b), the focus operator only asso-ciates with focus so that the difference in focus be-tween (2a) and (2b) induces a difference in mean-ing between the two utterances: in a world whereaon introduced Paul to Mary and Sarah, and noother introduction takes place, (2a) is necessarily430false whilst (2b) is true.
(2) a. Jon only int,vduced Paul to MARYb.
.Ion only intr'od,tced PAUL to MaryTo model this "association with focus" phe-nomenon, the semantics of associating-elements(e.g.
focus operators, qttantifieational dverbs) ismade contingent on the FSV which itself, wtrieswith the choice of focus.
The following exampleillustrates this.
Suppose that the meaning of o'nlgis determined by the following rule:\[NP only VP\]vP\[P ~ FSV A P (NP ' )  -+ P = VP'\]where NP' ,  VP' represent he meaning of NPand VP respectively, and t, kS'V stands for the fo-cus semantic value of the VP.
As we have seenabove, the FSV of (la) is ( lb), hence by the abovesemantic for only, the semantics of (1 a) is:VP\[P G {Ax.l(x, ~j) I Y ~ D~} A P(j)-~ \[' = ~z .
l (x ,  m)\]Intuitively, the only property of the form like-ing y that holds of Jon is the property of like ingMary.3 The  basic analysisFor computing the Focus Semantic Value, wepropose to use t\[igher Order Unification.
Morespecitically, given (part of) an utterance U withsemantic representation Sern and loci F1 .

b ''~,we require that the following equation, theground equat ion ,  be solved:Sere = Gd(l,'t)... (t,'")Assuming the typed A calculus as our seman-tic representation language, this equation can besolved by Huet's algorithm (cf.
(ltuet, 1975)),thus assigning a value to Gd.
On the basis of thisvalue, we can then define the FSV, written Gd, msfollows:Def in i t ion  3.1 (\['beus Semantic Value)Let Gd be of type c~ = ~ -+ t and ~ be the numberof loci (~ < k), then the fibcus Hemantic Valuederivable f,'om Gd, "writlen (;d, is {(;d(t'...*'~) It "i < wff~,}.As mentioned before, this yields a focus seman-tic value which is in essence i{ooth's AlternativeSet 1 .IThongh in fact, our definition is more syntacticthan Rooth.
In Rooth's approach, the I"SV definitionis purely semantic whereas in our approach the FSV isindirectly defined by solving equations and the valuethus obtained (i.e.
the value of Gd) is a term, that is,a syntactic object.
Hence, our I"SV can he more accu-rately contpared to  Kratzer's presuppositior~ skeletort,.This means that our approach inherits the adwmtagesof Kratzer's approach (c\['.
(Kratzer, 1991)).
In par-FinMly, we assume as in (Pulman, \[995),that loci ~ire stored and discharged nondeterministically as the need arises, thus con-tr ibuting to the definition of the ground equation.li'urthermore, equations are set up at the level atwhich there are needed e.g.
at the VP level in thecase of a pre-.verbal focus operator.qb illustrate the workings of onr approach, wenow run through a simple example.
Consider (la).To determine the meaning of only likes MARY,the FSV of the VP nmst be known, ttence thefollowing equation lnust be solved:: Gd(,,OBy tIOU, the value of (-Id is then2:(;d = AyAx.l(x, y)And by definition (3.1), the FSV is:c;g = y) ly  e wp;}Assuming the semantic of only given above, tkesemantic representation of (la) is then:VP\[P c {Ae~.l(x, y) \] v ~ wife} A P(j)P =In short, we obtain a reading similar to that ofl-tooth, the difference being in the way the FSV isdeterminecl: by I tOU in our approach, by meansof a semantic definition in Rooth's.4 Linguistic applicationsIn this section, we show that the I tOU approachf~wourably compares with I~.ooth's and Krifka'sanMysis in that it correctly generates interpreta-tions which these two theories fail to yield.
Aswe shall see, the main reason for this is that the| \[OU approach makes minimal assumptions aboutthe role syntax plays in determining the FSV.
Inparticular, it relies neither on the use of Quantifierl{aising, nor on the assumption of a rule to ruledefinition of the FSV.
In this way, it avoids someof the pitfalls these theories encounter.ti(:ular, it adequately captures the interaction of focuswith VP ellipsis as illustrated by Kratzer's notoriousex~ttnI)le: I ordy wer~t to TANGLE'WOO1) because youdid.2 Unification yields another possible value of C'd,namely A yXx.l(x,m).
In what follows, we assume arestriction similar to the DSP's P r imary  Oeeur-ren(:e Restr ict ion (l)ah'ymple et al, 1991)'s: theoccurrence directly associated with the focus is a pri-mary occurrence and any solution containing a pri-mary occurrence is discarded as linguistically invalid.For instance, *n is a primary occurrence in the equa-tion Xx.l(x,,n) = Gd(m) so thai; the solution Gd =AUA.9:.I(x, 7n) is invalid.
For a formal treatment ofl)SP's Primary Occurrence Restriction and a discus-sion of how it can be extended to {bcus, see ((?,ardentand Kohlhase, 1996).431We begin by a brief summary of l~.ooth's andKrifka's theories and stress the properties relevantfor the present discussion.
We then confront thethree theories with the data.4.1 Two alternative theories of focusRooth 's  A l te rnat ive  Semanti(:sIn l~,ooth's approach, the FSV is detined by re-(:ursion on the truth conditional structure whichis itself derived from LF (i.e.
Logical Form, theGovernment and Binding level of semantic rep-resentation).
Focus is then seen as introducing afree variable whose value is determined by the cur-rent context and is filrthermore constrained to bean element or a subset of the FSV.
For our pur-pose, the following characteristics are particularlyimportant:?
Given Rooth's definition of the AlternativeSet, a focus operator associates with any tb-cus occurring in its scope.?
Any NP may be subject to Quantifier Rais-ing.
Importantly, this includes focused NPs.?
Quantifier Raising may not apply to quanti-tiers occurring in a scope -island.Note that Rooth's approach criticaJly relies onquantifier aising as a means of moving a focusedNP out of the scope, of a focus operator.
Howeverthis only applies if the focus NP is not eml:)eddedin a scope island.Kritl~t's S t ruc tured  Mean ingsKrifl(a's approach defines a rule-to-.rule seman-tics which assigns to any syntactic onstituent, ameaning which can be either a k term or a struc-tured meaning, i.e.
a tuple oF the form {Gd,/")where Gd is Krilka's I,'ocus Semantic Value and 1,"is a (possibly cornl)Iex) \[bcus.For our purpose, an iinportant characteristic o\['Krifka.
's approach is the tight syntax/semantic in-teraction it presupposes.
In particular, the theoryrequires that a focus operator combines with asyntactic onstituent C whose, structured se.man-tics C' -- (Gd, F) provides the focus (1,') this op-erator associates with.
In other words, the right -adjacent sibling of a \[b(:us operator must containall and only the loci this operator associates with.As we shMl later see, some of the data does notseem to square with this assumption.4.2 Mult ip le Focus OperatorsUtterances with multiple locus operators 3 areknown pathological cases of focus theory:(3) a.

In (Gardent et al, 1996), we show in moredetail how the analysis accounts for the interac-tion of focus with anaphora nd definiteness in thecase of a particular instantiation of SOEs, namelycorrections.Compar i son  wi th  Rooth  and Kr i fkaUnder the Alternative Semantics approach,SOEs are captured as follows.
It is assumed thatthe quantification domain of focus operators is avariable whose value is contextually determined.In the standard case (i.e.
the case where the fo-cus is prosodically marked), this quantification do-main of focus operators is usually identified withtire FSV of the VP.
However, in the SOE cases,the assumption is that the quantification domainof focus operators is identified with the FSV ofthe source clause.
Thus in (5a), the quantifica-tion of only in the second clause is identified withthe FSV of the preceding utterance i.e.
the set ofproperties of the ~brm like ing somebody.But now, consider the following example:(6) a. don only likes MARY.b.
* No, PETER only likes Sarah.Clearly, this dialog is ill-formed in that (6b)is no appropriate correction for (6a).
However,under the Alternative Semantics approach, it willnot be ruled out since the FSV of (6a) providesan appropriate quantification domain for the fo-cus operator in (6b): as required by the semanticof pre verbal only, it is a set of properties whoseelements can be identified with the VP seman-tic value Ax.l(x, rn).
Hence although Rooth's ap-proach captures ome cases of SOEs, it does notseem to provide an adequate characterisation fthe phenomena t hand.The Structured Meanings proposal distingui-sires between proper- and quasi-SOEs.
Proper-SOEs involve an exact repetition of some previ-ous linguistic material, and are analysed as in-volving an anaphor which is constrained by therestriction that it be a segmental copy of its an-tecedent.
For instance, the semantics of only likesMary in (5b) is not determined by the semanticsof its parts but is instead identified with the se-mantic value of its antecedent only likes MARYin (5a).
In contrast, quasi SOEs only involvesemantic equivalence between repeating and re-peated material (for instance, in a quasi-SOE arepeated element may be pronominalised).
Krifkaclaims that quasi-SOEs have prosodically markedloci and thus do not raise any specific difficulty.However this theory faces a number of method-ological and empirical difficulties.
First, it is noncompositional because tire meaning of the deac-cented material in proper-SOEs is solely definedby the meaning of its antecedent (rather than themeaning of its parts).
Second, the prosodic datais rather unclear: the assumption that quasi-SOEcontains a prosodically marked focus is a mootpoint (cf.
(Bartels, 1995)) and if it proves tobe false, the analysis fails to account for quasi-SOEs.
Third, it is counterintuitive in that it han-dles separately two classes of data (i.e.
quasi- andproper SOEs) which naturally belong together.Indeed, the HOU approach can be shown to pro-vide a uniform treatment of quasi - and proper-SOEs (cf.
(Gardent et al, 1996)).5 Formal  p roper t ies  o f  the  HOUapproachThe unification problem can be stated as follows:Given two terms of a logic M and N, is therea substitution, or, of terms for variables that willmakethe two terms identical (i.e.
~r(M) = (r(N))?It is well-known that for Higher-Order Logic(e.g.
the typed A calculus) the space of solutionscan be infinite and furthermore, the HOU prob-lem is only semi-decidable so that tile unificationalgorithm need not terminate for unsolvable prob-lems.Fortunately, in our case we are not interestedin general unification, but we can use the factthat our formulae belong to very restricted syn-tactic subclasses, for which much better resultsare known.
In particular, the fact that free vari-ables only occur on the left hand side of our equa-tions reduces the problem of finding solutions tohigher-order matching, of which decidability hasbeen proven for the subclass of third-order for-mulae (Dowek, 1992) and is conjectured for tilegeneral case.
This class, (intuitively allowing onlynesting flmctions as arguments up to depth two)covers all of our examples in this paper.
For adiscussion of other subclasses of formulae, wherehigher-order unification is computationally feasi-ble see (Prehofer, 1994).6 Conc lus ionIn this paper, we have argued that Higher-OrderUnification provides an adequate tool for com-puting Focus Semantic Values.
To this end, wehave considered ata which is viewed as a test--bed for focus theory and shown that, whilst exist-ing theories either under-generate, over-generateor are methodologically unsatist%ctory, the ttOUapproach yields a simple and transparent analysis.There appear to be two main reasons for this.434l,'irst, the HOU analysis makes minimal as-sumptions about the role syntax is called to playin determining the I"SV.
lit is detined on a purelysemantic level in the sense that unification oper-ates on semantic representations, and relies nei-ther on quantifier raising, nor on a rule-to-ruledefinition of the FSV.
As we have seen, this typeof approach is a plausible way to avoid under-generation.Second, the HOU approach permits an equa-tional analysis which can naturally be Nrther con-strained by additional equations.
The interest ofsuch an approach was illustrated in our treatmentof SOEs which we characterise as involving twophenomena: the computation of an I"SV, and theresolution of a &'accented anaphor.
Not only didwe show that this analysis is methodologically andempirically sound, we also showed that it finds anatural realisation in the equational framework ofIIOU: each linguistic phenomena is characterisedby some equation(s) and the equations may mu-tually constrain each other.
For instance, in thecase of SOEs, we saw that the equations character-ising the deaccented anaphor help determine theunidentified FSV of the utterance containing theunmarke(I focus.Clearly, our approach extends to cases of a(t-verbial quantification.
For lack of space we couldnot develop the theory here; let us just pointout that yon Fintel's criticism (von Fintel, 1995)of semantic approaches to tbcus, also applies toKrifka's Structured Meanings analysis, but notto the ItOU approach presented here.
Von Fin-tel points out that in certain cases of adverbialquantification, a focus operator associates withan unmarked tbcus and dots not associate witha marked tbcus occurring in its scope - as shouldbe clear fl'om this article, this is unproblematic forour analysis.Of course, there art still many open issues.First, how does the proposed analysis interactwith quantification?
Second, how does it extendto a dynamic semantics (e.g.
Discourse Represen-tation Theory)'?7' AcknowledgmentsThe work reported in this paper was flmdedby the l)eutsche l,~orschungsgetneinschaft (I)FG)in Sonderforschungsbereieh S1"B-378, Project C2(MSA).Re ferencesChristine Bartels.
