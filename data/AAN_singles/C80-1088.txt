THE MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF BAHASA MALAYSIACh~ May SeeSchool of Mathematical SciencesUniversiti Sains MalaysiaPenangMalaysiaAbstractThis paper describes a model for theautomated morphological analysis of BahasaMalaysia (the Malay language) via the ATEFsystem, a component of the mechanicaltranslation system known as ARIANE, which wasdeveloped by G.E.T.A.
at Grenoble.
This modelserves two purposes, that is, to test thecapability of handling Bahasa Malaysiamorphological analysis using ATEF and also toprovide a first working model.This grammar covers the three mainmorphological processes in Bahasa Malaysiaanalysis, that is, affixation, reduplicationand compounding.Reduplication is the process whereby abase or some part of the base is repeated.There are three types of reduplication -proper, rhyming and chiming.
Reduplicationof nouns generally gives a semantic categoryof heterogeneity or indefinite plural whilereduplication of verbals result in one of thefollowing semantical features: repetition,continuity, habituality, intensity, extensive-ness and resemblance.Compound forms are constructions that havetwo or three free forms as their constituentsand each of the constituent forms may eitherbe a rootform or derived form.Affixation is a morphological processwhereby a base may be extended by one or moreaffixes.
Affixes may be classified as prefixe~suffixes, infixes and circumfixes.
Multipleaffixation is also not uncommon in BahasaMalaysia though no construction exceeds threelayers of affixation.
Several features areobtained through affixation.
On affixation,morphographemic changes may occur depending onthe initial segment of the rootform, wordclasses of the derived words are set and alsosemantical features are set.
The setting ofsemantical features may be further complicatedas a result of multiple affixation.Unlike affixation, the handling ofreduplication and compounding do not presentmuch of a problem for ATEF and is quitestraightforward.
Affixation is a morecomplicated process but also a more importantprocess.A simple finite state diagram is used todepict the basic overall structure for thehandling of multiple affixation as a moredetailed finite state diagraw is notjustifiable.Morphographemic changes occur mainly withthe prefixes pe N and me N in which differentallomorphs are ~sed depending on the initialsegments of the derived word.
On deletion ofthese allomorphs to obtain the resultant form,segments may have to be added to the resultantform, the form remains unchanged or sub-stituted.
This means that rules have to beprovided for the treatment of each of theseallomorphs individually.The main word classes in Bahasa Malaysiaare nominals, verbals, auxiliaries, adverbalsand particles and these again can be sub-categorised.
The word class of a derived wordis dependent on its affix and on affix deletionto obtain the rootform, its word class is set.For multiple affixation, the outermost prefix(if any) determines the word class.Affixation also results in modificationsor additional semantical features.
Each affixcarries a set of possible semantical features.For example, the prefix pe N may cause thewordform to be agentive, i~strumental, theobject of action, etc.
Which is the correct'role' depends on the base on which the prefixwas attached.
In this model, no decision ismade as to which semantical feature is thecorrect one.
Instead, the whole set offeatures are set when the affix has beendetected.Although it may be possible to sub-categorise the word classes into groups withcommon semantical features, this model so faronly considers grouping according to wordclasses and does not consider subgroupings forsemantical features.
Work is now in progressto include such subgrouping to provide a morecomplete morphological analysis of BahasaMalaysia.
This model not only handles thesethree main morphological processes, but alsohandles idiomatic expressions as well.
Oncompletion of morphological analysis, all theinformation gathered is submitted to the nextstage of the ARIANE system, that is, thesyntactical analysis stage in order to buildup a more complete 'picture' of BahasaMalaysia.- -578  - -IntrodUctionThe Malay language has been the nationallanguage of Malaysia since 1955 and with theformation of Malaysia in 1963, it has beenknown as Bahasa Malaysia (B.M.).
B.M.
belongsto the Western Group of the AustronesianFamily and is spoken by people through Malaysia,Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei.
There are anumber of 'varieties' of B.M.
- the regionaltype, pidginised B.M.
as well as standard B.M.,that is, that ~variety' used formally andofficial in government establishments, formalinstitutions as well as in mass communication.The morphological analysis described in thispaper is based on this particular variety, thatis, standard B.M.B.M.
uses both the Romanised and Arabicscripts for its writing system.
For thispurpose, the Roman script proposed in 'PedomanUmum Ejaan Bahasa Malaysia 'I will be used.This system was an attempt to standardise thespelling system of both B.M.
and the Indonesianlanguage.This paper suggests a morphological modelfor B.M.
using the ATEF system which wasdeveloped by the GETA group at UniversiteScientifique et Medicale Grenoble~ The ATEFsystem is part of an interactive system knownas ARIANE-78.
AKIANE-78 is a software toolfor machine-aided translation to whichlinguistic data (grammars, dictionaries,heuristic) formalised in some external artifi-cial language is given.
It includes thefollowing components:i. ATEF " a non-deterministic finitestate transducer which is used forgenerating programs for morphologicalanalysis.2.
ROBRA - a tree-to-tree transducerwhich is used for multi-level analysis(syntax and partial semantics), forthe structural transfer and also forsyntactic generation in the targetlanguage.3.
TRANSF - a system for bi-lingualdictionary look-up.
It is used forlexieal transfer.4.
SYGMOR - a deterministic finite statetransducer used for morphologicalgeneration.This paper describes the modelling ofthis linguistic data to be supplied to ATEFfor morphological analysis.
No attempt hasbeen made to describe in detail the usage northe writing of the external artificiallanguage for ATEF as the purpose of this modelis to test the capability of handling B.M.morphological analysis under ATEF and also toprovide a first working model for B.M.In the sections that follow, a morpholo-gical description of B.M.
will be given,followed by the morphological model.B.M.
GrammarThe morphological description given hereis taken mainly from 'The Morphology of Malay'~There are three main morphologicalprocesses in B.M., that is, reduplication,compounding and affixation.ReduplicationReduplication is the process whereby abase or some part of the base is repeated.In B.M.
there are two types of reduplication:reduplication proper and rhyming and chiming.Reduplication proper may be partial or full.For partial reduplication, the duplicate isdetermined by the initial or final syllableof the base.
In initial syllable reduplication,only the initial consonant of the base(provided it begins with a consonant) isrepeated while the rest of the duplicate is ofconstant shape (i.e., -ek).
In final syllablereduplication, the last syllable is repeatedwithout any change.
For example,budak 'child' ~ bek-budak 'children'(initial syllable)dak-budak ' children'(final syllable)Partial duplication generally occurs onlyin colloquial B.M.
whereas full duplicationoccurs in standard B.M.In full duplication, the duplicate isidentical to the whole base.
For example,budak 'child' ~ budak-budak 'children'Rhyming and chiming is also calledreduplication with phonetic change.
A compoundform is called rhyming if one syllable of thebase is repeated in the duplicate, example,k~i_h 'cake' ~ k~mH~h 'variety of cakes'and chiming if all the consonants are repeatedin the duplicate and only the vowels changes,example,~-579 -~HEEE~ 'mountain' ~ su_n_un~xsanan $'variety of mountains'Generally, proper reduplication of nounsgives a semantic category of heterogenity orindefinite plural while rhyming and chiminghas the added feature of variety.
As forverbals, proper reduplication may result in atleast one of the following semantical features:repetition, continuity, habituality, intensity,extensiveness and resemblance.
For example,baca 'to read' ~ baca-baca.... 'to read repeatedly/continually/always'kunin$ 'to be yellow' ~ kunin$Ek~n~n$'to be very yellow/yellowish/yellow all over/always'When occurring with dynamic verbs,rhyming and chiming gives the semanticalfunction of repetition, example,beli 'to buy' ~ beli-belah.... 'to buy again and again'and that of intensification when occurring withstative verbs, example,malu 'to be shy' ~malu-malah'to be very shy'CompoundingA compound form is a construction that hastwo or three free forms as its constituentswhere each of the constituent forms may beeither a root or a derived form, example,k~_~ 'firewood'(ka~H 'wood' and a~ 'fire')suratkhabar 'newspaper'(surat 'letter' and khabar 'news')AffixationAffixation is the process whereby a basemay be extended by one or more affixes.Affixation is the most common and widely usedof the three morphological processes.
Affixesmay be classified as prefixes, suffixes,infixes and circumfixes.PrefixesThe more common prefixes in B.M.
include~, ~,  ~,  E~, ~, ~,  ~,  ~_E, ~_~,ke.
This list of prefixes with the exception ofp~ N and me N do not result in any morpho-gr~phemic changes.
Prefixes me N and pe Ntake on different forms (its al~omorphs)--depending on the initial segment of the root-forms.
For example, for the prefix meN,  itsallomorphs are:1. me - used with the letters i, m, n, ng,ny, r, w, y2.
mere - used with b, p, f, v (f and pdropped)3. men - used with d, t, c, j, z (t dropped)4. meng - vowels, g, h, k (k dropped)5. meny - s (s dropped)6. menge - for monosyllabic forms.Examples:i. me N + lawat 'to visit' ~ melawat 'to visit'2.
me__N + ~k~!
'to hit' ~ memukul 'to hit'3.
me N + cari 'to find' ~ mencari 'to find'4.
me N + kacau 'to disturb' ~ mensa~a~'to disturb'5.
me N6.
me N+ ~ 'to sweep' ~m~_n~a~ 'to sweep'+ ~a~ 'to paint' ~ mense~at 'to paint'The same rules hold for the prefix pe_N.SuffixesThe addition of suffixes do not presentsuch morphographemic changes.
Suffixes aremerely attached to the rootform without anychanges being made to the suffix nor the root ~form.
Four 'layers' of suffixes are possiblein B.M., that is, from the innermost layeroutwards, we have:I. an, wan, wati, man, is, isma2.
i, kan3.
mu, ku, kau, nya4.
lah, kahThere is no co-occurrence of suffixes ineach 'layer' except for 'i' and 'kan'.
As anexample, from the word baharu 'new', we have,on affixation,di + baharu + i + kan + nya + kahd~baha~ka_n_n~akah'is it renewed(by subject)?'
--580InfixesThere are three infixes in B.M.
- '-el-','-em-' and '-er-'.
For example,getar + el ~ se~a~ 'to tremble'gilang + em ~ sem~$ 'to be verysplendid'gigis + er ~ $~!~!~ 'to be very uneven'These three infixes are not productiveand only account for a small number of word-forms only.CircumfixesCircumfixes are discontinuous combinat-ions of prefixes and suffixes.
The mostcommon circumfix is 'ke an'.
Example, bycircumfixation of the w~rd ban~ak_ 'many', wehaveke + banyak + an ~ ~ Z ~  'majority'Syntactical and Semantical FeaturesAffixation also plays an important rolein the setting of the syntactical as well assemantical features of a wordform.
It cancause a change in the grammatical class of thewordform or even to change the meaning of thewordform.
For example,latih 'to train' + an ~ latihan 'training'(syntactical change)pe_N + dapat 'to obtain' ~ ~ 2 ~'opinion' (semantical change)In B.M., the nominal affixes are thosewhich cause the wordform it is attached to, totake on the grar~natical category of nominals.These affixes include~:~, ~,  ~,  ~,  _ma~, ~,  ~,  ~,ke-anVerbal affixes are those which result in averbal category, example,~,  ~e, e~, ~:~,  ~,  k~,  fi~, ~ ,~e ,  i ,  ~:~Affixes also provide semantical featuresto the wordforms they are attached to.
Forexample, the semantical features that can beset to the wordforms to which the prefix 'ber'is attached arereflexive, possessive, or productive.Which particular feature should beassigned depends on the wordform itself.example,Forber + cukor ' to shave' ~ bercukor'to shave oneself' (reflexive)ber + kereta 'car' ~ berkereta'to possess a car' (possessive)ber + anak 'child' ~ beranak'to give birth' (productive)Multiple AffixationMultiple affixation also occurs in B.M.Fortunately, not more than three layers ofaffixation can occur, e.g.,ber + ke + se + orang 'person' + an~E~?1~$~ 'to sufferloneliness'Multiple affixation results in addedcomplexities in the setting of semanticalfeatures.
The syntactical category of theaffixed wordform is the category set by theoutermost prefix.
But due to combinations ofaffixes, the semantical features may increaseand sometimes even differ.
For example,pe-N + da~ 'to obtain' ~ pendapat'opinion'ber + ~nda~a~ ~ ~ !
~'possess opinion'The Morphological Model for B.M.The model described here covers the threemorphological processes described in the abovesection though not all are included.
Thoseexcluded are:i. partial reduplication - this onlyoccurs in colloquial B.M.
and not instandard B.M.2.
infixes - the small number ofoccurrences do not justify its hand-ling under ATEF.
They are merelyregarded as rootforms and set up asdictionary entries in this model.Reduplication and compounding are suitestraightforward and do not present much of aproblem in the morphological analysis of B.M.In this model, reduplicated words are treatedas 'compound words', that is, a single node(ULMCP) is created with the duplicates asbrother nodes.
For example, the compound wordkanaklkanak results in the following sub-tree:--581--ULOCC;!ULMCP;I!i !i iCompound words are treated as idiomaticexpressions and a single node is created forthem.
For example, the word b!~a h~E!f resultsin the following sub-tree:ULOCCit!BUTAttURUFAs affixation is the most complex of thethree processes, a Finite State Diagram isused to show the various stages in the de-seg-mentation of a given word-form:base r I / - -  +(3) lI !I prefix I I I r---- - -7  Ii \ ~ I I c - - 7/i ~ / , I  \ ?f_ x + ll) _ b_a t <2> .
.

.
<4)-- +I t iI i ll V i~ (5,).
- , -  - -'I , iI ?
, IL- ----- -->(6) ~- J  --- -JBeginning with state O, on encounteringa prefix, the analysis proceeds to state i.If a base is encountered, state 2 is reached.In state i, on encountering another prefix, itstill remains in state I.
This is due to thepossibility of having multiple affixation inB.M.
State i goes to state 2 when a base isencountered.
From state 2, whichever state isreached depends on which suffixes areencountered:state 3 - an, wan, wati, man, is, ismastate 4 - i, kanstate 5 - mu, ku, kau, nyastate 6 - lah, kahThis is due to the possible 'layering'in suffixation (as described above).
States2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are all final states in thisState Diagram.In each state, information is added to theextracted rootform as the analysis proceeds,e.g.
syntactical and semantical features setby affixation, reduplication, etc.
(asdescribed in the above section.)
The set ofsemantical features used in this model can beobtained from the Appendix.
In this model, nodecision is made as to which of the possiblesemantical features should be added when theaffix/affixes are deleted from the wordform.Instead, the whole set of possible featuresare added.
At the time of writing, furtherresearch is being carried out concerning theextraction of the correct semantical featureand not include the whole set.A sample of B.M.
morphological analysisof a text using this model is included in theAppendix.Limitations of ATEFWhile testing the model under ATEF, itwas found that ATEF could not handle twoaspects of B.M.:i.
Affixation of Proper NounsIn B.M., it is possible to attach theparticles kah and !~ to proper nouns, example,Ahmad 'name of person' + lah ~ Ahmadlah'Ahmad prt.
'Penang 'name of state' + kah ~ Penangkah'Penang prt.
'2.
Affixation of Idiomatic ExpressionsIdiomatic expressions in B.M.
can also besubjected to affixation, example,ber + buta huruf 'illiterate' ~ berbutah \ ]~\ ] f -T~-be illiterate'These two problems have been communicatedto the GETA group who are looking into theseproblems.ConclusionThis paper has attempted to provide apossible model for the morphological analysisof B.M.
under ATEF but is not the completemodel as yet.
More research work is being doneto refine this model with the ultimateobjective of providing as much information aspossible in the morphological analysis stageto be passed to the next stage in ARIANE-78,that is, the multi-level analysis stage underROBRA.
One aspect which is being looked intois the possibility of 'layering' prefixes justas has been done for suffixes.
Another area ofresearch is the possibility of extracting the- -582exact semantical feature set by affixation ofthe word-form, instead of including the wholeset of possible semantical features.
Thiswould remove much ambiguity and would alsosimplify the analysis in the next stage.AppendixSemantical Features on AffixationPrefixesPe N (agentive, qualitative, instrument,abstract, unit of measure, objectof action, profession).SeBerTer= (similar, singular).= (reflexive, possessive, productive.= (unintentional, superlative,capability, past).PerJ u ru= (causative passive).= (profession).Suffixesi = (causative with locative benefactivecomplement).k anan= (causative benefactive).= (resultative, locative, collective,variety, repetition).Circumfixespe_an = (process).se an = (abstract, locative, resemblance,pass ive).583 -PAGE IESSAI  T iGA "/ AVSIL 19E~0 Fqf ~2~I :  ~KANAK-KANAK DI RGMAIINYA ADaLAH BUTA NU~UF .
