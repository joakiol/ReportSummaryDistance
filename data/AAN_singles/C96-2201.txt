dkAbstractThis paper describes Pa~lh'ans - a fullyautomatic production MT system de-signed for producing raw translationsof patent texts fl'om English into Dan-ish.
First we describe the backbone oftile system: the EUROTRA researchproject, and prototype.
Then we givean overview of the trauslat, ion processand the basic flmetionality of Pa'I~'ans,and finally we describe some recent ex-tensions for improving processing effi-ciency and the translation quality of un-exl)ected input encountered in real-lit~texts.1 Introduct ionPa\]~'ans 1 is a fully-automatic machine transla-tion system designed for English-Danish transla-tion of patent, texts.
It is based on the linguisticspecifications and to some extent on the softwareof the EUROTRA project of the European Com-munity (Copeland et al, 1991a; Copeland et al,1991b).
Pa'IYans consists of a core grammar andtranslation module and a host of peripheral util-ities: terin databases, general databases, editorsfor pre- and postediting, document handling fa-cilities, facilities for creating and updating termdatabases.
In this short presentation we will con-centrate on the grammar, lexicon and translationmodule and on some of the new features of Pa-~i~'ans.2 From EUROTRA to  PaTransEUROTRA was the European Community MTresearch programme.
The Community started theprogramme in 1982, with the goal of creating anadvanced systeln for automatic translation capa-ble of treating all the otficial working languages ofthe Community.
When the programme finished in1992, it had delivered a huge amount of research1paTrans was developed for Lingtech A/S.results and an implemented prototype of a multi-lingual translation system.
The PaTrans develop-meat relics on the prototype resources (Macgaardand Hansen, 1995), the system architecture andlinguistic specifications, as well as on the experi-enced staff created by EUROTRA.2.1 The EUROTRA PrototypeEUROTI{A was a transfer-based multilingual MTproject.
Because of the multilinguality, the proto-type was quite "clean" in terms of separate mod-ules for analysis, transtL'r and synthesis of the var-ious languages and language pairs.2.1.1 SottwareThe software component consisted of the t;lans-lation kernel, used tbr analysis, transfer and gen-eration.
The trmisb~tion kernel had mechanismsfor treating grammar ules, dictionary informa-tion and mapping rules.2.1.2 LingwareFor all languages, the project produced alarge grammar and a general anguage dictionary.Though insufficient for the task at hand, the Pa:'lk'ans development eould buil<l on the English andDanish grammars and dictionaries, as well as onthe transfer module from English into Daifish.2.2 Customizing EUROTRAPatent texts are characterised by the vocabularythey contain: terlns belonging t;o the fiehl tt'eated ,e.g.
chemistry, and patent document erms of amore legal nature.
But; patent documents are alsocharaeterised by tile frequency of some linguisticphenomena and the absence of others, e.g.
we hadto develop ~ treatnmnt of lists and emmmration,and conversely we could simplify the treatment ofmodality considerably.
The current maintenanceand further development of the system continuesthis text type specific lille.
The success of the sys-tem is mainly based on this fundamental lnincipleof tailoring it; to a specific text type and sub jeerfield.11153 An  overv iew o f  the  Trans la t ionP rocess3.1 Document handlingThe document handling step has four main flmc-tions:?
Format  P reservat ion  Input to docuinenthandling is a text from a text processing sys-tem which has been marked up in SGML.
TileSGML codes denote e,.g.
titles, paragraphs,text segments that should not be translated,etc.
All information about doc, ument layoutis stored separately and taken away from thetranslation process.?
Formula  Recogn i t ion  The docmnent han-dler automatically recognises certain texttypical untranslatable units, such as chemi-cal formulas and tables.?
Term Reeognition Terms and multi-wordunits are also recognised at this stage, in thiscontext, words are treated as terms if they aresubject specific or if they have a unique trans-lation in the given text type.
They are recog-nised during text handling and have theirtranslation equivalent attaehed to them alongwith inorphosyntactic nformation for bothsource and target language.?
Segmentat ion  Finally tile text, is separatedinto units for translation i.e.
sentences forwhich various recognition patterns haw ~.
beenset up.
In some patent texts of specfic sub-ject tields, tile sentences are incredibly long.In these cases, there is no point in trying toarrive at a complete parse of the whole sen-tence, since the parse is most likely to failand processing will be too space and timeconsuming.
Therefore the docmnent handlerattempts to arrive at a meaningflfl partitionof the sentences by identifying sentence inter-nal boundaries and submitting the individualsubparts for translation.3.1.1 DisambiguationBefore the text is passed on to the parser, itis subjected to a thorough process of disambigua-tion.
This is one of the new features of PaTranscompared to the EUR()TRA model and will bediscussed in detail below.3.1.2 Source language analysisSince PaTrans is based on the transfer transla-tion model tile surface strings of the text are se-quentially transformed into an interinediate repre-sentation defined by several mapping principles.During source language analysis the sentencesare assigned a surface syntactic structure.
Thissurface syntactic structure is converted into alanguage-neutral transfer epresent, ation orderingthe constituents of the sentence in a canonicalorder with heads preceeding arguments and ar=guments preceding modifiers (Copeland et al,1991a).
The, transfer representation is a re-flection of tile argument structure of the pred-icates where iuformation about surface syntac-tic realization appears as features on the indi-vidual nodes.
Function words (coRjmwtions, de-terminers, prepositional case markers) are featur-ized and tense/aspect and negation represented inlanguage-neutral features.The output of source language analysis is thus atree with multi lwered information including syn-tactic and morphosyntactic features, as well asthe syntactic/semantic relationships between thepredicators and the arguments,At, all levels, sets of preference rules based onheuristic principles elect among competing analy-ses, e.g.
for PP-attachment (Bennett and Paggio,1993).3.1.3 Trans ferPaTrans adheres to simple transfer, i.e.
thesubstitution of source language lexical units withtarget language lexical units by means of lexicaltransfer ules, 9 while the source language stru<>tural representation is mapped directly onto thetarget language transfer representation which isinput to tile generation module.
There are twomain reasons why complex transfer (i.e.
transferwhere the strucl;ure of the input representation isaltere(t) is kept at a minimum:?
Complex transfer is costly inasmuch as thegeneral applicability of the rules is usuallyvery restricted.?
A transfer ule applies to any object matchingits left-hand side and performs the mappingdefined on the right-hand side.
Due to the'fail-soft'-mechanisin (discussed below), thestructure of the objects which the transferrules nmst apply to cannot he flflly predicted.In order for complex transfer to work in allcases, rules must be set up not only for cor-rectly parsed input structures, but also fortile special fail-soft structures.
For this rea-son, complex transfer is costly and is onlyused for frequent phenomena considered cru-cial for good translation, e.g.
converting cer-tain English ing-forins into l)anish relativeclauses.3.1.4 Target syntactic generationDuring gelmration, the transti;r representa-tion is mat)ped onto a target syntactic structurethrough intermediate representational lewfls.
At,the first level, the target language lexical unitsare looked up in the lexical database and mon(}-lingually relevant features are calculated on the2Recall theft this only applies to words of the gen-eral vocabulary which require disaint}iguation duringanalysis and not to terms1116basis of the language-neuLral representation, e.g.tense and asl)eet.At Lhe second level (Lhe relational level) sur-face syntactic flmcLions are (:alculaLed and cer-tain flmcLion words, sut:h as t)reposiLional mark-ers are inserted.
Finally, the relational sLru(:tureis mapped onto the level defining tim constituenLsLructure of Lhe target language sentent:e.

The mod-ule is based on sLrueture, buihling rules whi(:b al-low for downwards ext)ansion.

PaTrans also has alimited strategy for LranslaLing (:ompounds com-posil, ionally.
Generally, comI)ounds are co(led inthe (terminoh)gical) dictionari('.s, 1)uL the t)arsertries to translate (:ompom~ds which are not code(tin the dictionarie.s by translating their individualsubparts.3.1.6 Document  generat ionFinally, the doemnent generation module in-serLs ~fll SGML-inarkers anti all iLems which havebeen inarke.d as mlLranslatable (tal)les, formulas,illlllflbe, rs el;(;.

a4 The  lex ical'a~iYans distinguishes two kinds of voealmlm'ies:the general vocabulary and Lhe Lerminologi(:al vo-cabulm'ies.?
The general vocabulary is stored in a mono-lingual English dictionary, a monolinguall)anish dictionary separated into a. inLo syn-tactic and a morphological level, and a t)ilin-gual transfer dictionary.?
The terminology is divided into sul).ject spe-cific databases.
As PaTrans is used for anuml)er of ditferenL subject fields, the prioriLyof the databases is user-defined and flexible,The user specifies which term bases are to beused for a translation .job, and in wtfich or-der of prioriLy.

dm tagger t, rics to determinethe t)arl;-of-st)e(w.h of the individual words based1117on local cooccurrence r strictions.
There are tworeasons why the tagger has been integrated intothe system:?
Since the overall translation system isunification-based, words are disambiguatedby the application of all possible rules, whichis highly inefficient.?
If the sentence is fail-sorted, one intermedi-ate analysis is picked from the chart, whichmeans that all words may not have been dis-ambiguated properly by the grammar ules.If, however, the words have been disam-biguated and impossible readings have beendiscarded prior to parsing the 'best-fit'-parseis considerably better than it would otherwisehave been.The tagger is a public-domain, rule based tag-ger.
It has been trained on a corpus of the WallStreet Journal and on patent exts within the sub-ject field.
In addition, it has been augmented withseveral 'local' contextual rules developed by thelinguists working with PaTrans.
The integrationof the tagger has not only provided for more ef-fecient processing but, more importantly, also fora higher quality of the translations of fail-softedsentences.
Current efforts aim at improving theperformance of the tagger.5.3 PreparsingThe original EUROTRA-parser has been aug-mented with special rules which apply before theactual grammar ules (Music, 1993).
The goal isto enable more efficient handling of long sentencesthat are otherwise unprocessable given moder-ate resources.
With pre-rules, sentences are seg-mented via pattern-matching, before they are sentto the parser.
In this way, the number of parsepaths that the system has to consider is reducedconsiderably.To give greater power to the preparser, pre-ruleapplication has been made cyclic.
This meansthat the output from one rule application (or oneapplication cycle) is used as input to a new cy-cle which starts at the beginning of the rule set.In principle then, any rule can feed (i.e.
createthe preconditions needed for application of) anyother rule, while at the same time allowing pri-oritization of rules, The pre-rules not only addstructure to the input, they are also used for lex-ical disambiguation based on collocatives and im-mediate context.
Where the rule based taggerdescribed above is able to determine the part-of-speech of individual words based on prior train-ing and contextual rules, pre-rules can select in-dividual readings of words within the same part-of-speech.
Pre-rules have been developed for lex-teal disambiguation and for parsing of adverbialphrases, complex verb groups, coordinated that-clauses, indexed lists, valency-bound prepositionalphrases and explicitly marked intervals (e.g.
from?..
to, between.., and).
The effects of pre-rules aretwofold: On tile one hand they assign structure totile input at a shallow level, which nevertheless in-creases processing efficiency considerably, on theother hand they also improve fail-soft results sinceinappropriate r adings of words in a given contextare discarded at an early stage.6 Per fo rmancePaTrans is in everyday use at the translationagency Lingtech where it is being used for all textswhich are suited for it in its current version, i.e.chemical, biochemical, medical etc.
patents, andgradually also a considerable amount of mechan-ical patents.
PaTrans is making the translationprocess faster and more efficient, and it has provento be a good business for Lingteeh, saving around50% of the raw translator cost.7 Conc lus ionPaTrans is a running production translation sys-tem producing cost-effective raw translations ofpatent texts.
But PaTrans is also a project whichcombines academic research and practical appli-cations and which has shown that MT is viable inlimited domains.
Current work concentrates onimproving the coordination of the rule-based partof the systeln and the fail-soft component.ReferencesBennett, P. and Paggio, P., editors (1993).
