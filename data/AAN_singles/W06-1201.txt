Proceedings of the Workshop on Multiword Expressions: Identifying and Exploiting Underlying Properties, page 1,Sydney, July 2006. c?2006 Association for Computational LinguisticsCompositionality and Multiword Expressions: Six of One, Half aDozen of the Other?Timothy BaldwinMelbourne UniversityIn this talk, I will investigate the relationship between compositionality and multiword expressions,as part of which I will outline different approaches for formalising the notion of compositionality.
I willthen briefly review computational methods that have been proposed for modelling compositionality, andapplications thereof.
Finally, I will discuss possible future directions for modelling compositionality, andpresent some preliminary results.1
