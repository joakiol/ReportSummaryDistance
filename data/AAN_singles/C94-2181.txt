In t roduct ionDiscourse Representation Theory (DRT) dueto Kamp (1981) provides a promising frame-work for discourse semantics.
DRT is in factsuccessul in formalizing several challenging top-ics, e.g.
anaphora, tense and belief; see Asher(1986, 1993) and Helm (1982).
Due to its clearsemantics with the construction algorithm, DRTis also used as a background theory in compu-tational lhtguistics; see Wada and Asher (1986)and Ishikawa and Akama (1992).However, DRT lacks a deductive (proof-theoretic) formulation to serve as an abstractinterpreter for discourse understanding, sinceit is formalized by means of the notion of par-tial models.
This prevents us from utilizingDRT in various ways for natural  anguage un-derstanding systems.
To make DR'\]' more flex-ible for computational linguistics, we need togeneralize a formal basis in a proof-theoreticfashion.
If this is successful, computational lin-guists will be able to reconstruct DRT for theirown systems using programming languages likeProlog and LISP.
There are perhaps severalways to give an operational semantics of DRT.One of the attractive approaches i to investi-gate consequence r lations associated with DR'I?.It is thus very useful to study some conse-quence relations in DRT to develop differentversions of DRT.The purpose of this paper is to explore con-sequence relations in DRT, one of which ex-actly produces Kamp's original semantics.
Weincorporate some consequence r lations definedby part ial  semantics into DRT using sequentcalculi.
Our attempt enables us to display sev-eral versions of DRT by employing differentconsequence r lations.
We also show some con-nections of the proposed consequence r lationsand part ial  ogics in the literature.2.
Overv iew o f  DRTIn this section, we give a brief introductionto DRT.
For a detailed exposition, the readershould consult Asher (1993).
The basic ideaof DRT is to formalize a dynamic represen-tation of part ial  interpretations by means ofclassical models using a construction algorithmof discourse representation structures (DRSs).Observe that DRSs can be regarded as suchabstract objects as part ial  models, mental rep-resentations, or (partial) possible worlds.
But,1114such identifications do not seem essential to thesignificance of DRT.
'\]'he language of DRT is called DiscourseRepresentation Language (DRL), which is likea standard quantifier-free first-order languageexcept discourse referents and conditions.
Thelogical symbols of DRL include =: (identity),--~ (comlitional), V (disjunction) and ~ (nega-tion).
A discourse representation (DR) K isexpressed as a pair (UK, ConE), where UE is aset of discourse re\]erents, and Conic is a set ofconditions.
Each condition is either atomic orcomplex.
Complex conditions are of the form:K1 :~ K2, KI V K2 or ~K1, where both K1and K2 are Dl~s.A discourse representation structure (DRS)is a partial ly ordered set of DRs, which canbe constructed by means of DRS constructionrules whose application reflects the syntacticcomposition of the sentences in the discourse.When each DR of a DRS is maximal, the DRSis called a complete DRS.
Intuitively speaking,each stage in the construction algorithm canbe viewed as a part ial  possible worlds, in whichmore information resulting from the processingof a further bit of the discourse changes it intoa more precise description of the world.A model for DRL is an ordered pair (DM,FM), where DM is the domain of M and FMis an interpretation function of constants andpredicates.
An embedding \]'unction for a DRK in a model M is a mapping from discoursereferents in UK into the domain of M. An ex-tension of an embedding flmction f for K in Mto an embedding function g for K'  in M is de-fined as g: (Dora(f) U UE, ) --~ DM.
We writef C K g to mean that g extends an embeddingfunction f to an embedding of K'.
The notaionM ~-t,K C abbreviates that M satisfies C un-der ffor K. A proper embedding of K in M is anembeddhtg flmetion such that f ~K g and forany condition C in K, M ~g,E C. The notionsof proper embedding and satisfaction can beextended to general cases by slmnltaneous re-cursion; see Asher (1993).
A DR K is shown tobe true in a model M iff there is a proper em-bedding of K in M. A DR K implies a DR K' iffevery model in which K is true is also a modelin which K' is true.
This definition induces aconsequence relation in DRT, but we have noreason to consider it as the only plausible forDRT.
In fact, it is our job in tMs paper to seekalternate definitions.3.
Consequence  Re la t ions  and  SequentC alcul lA part ial  semantics for classical logic is implicitin the so-called Beth tableaux.
This insight canbe generalized to study consequence relationsin terms of Gentzen calculi.
The first impor-tant work in this direction has been done byvan Benthem (1986, 1988).
We here try to ap-ply this technique to DRT.
Since our approachcan replace the base logic of DRT by other in-teresting logics, we obtain alternative versionsof DttT.Recall the basic tenet of Beth tableaux.Namely, Beth tableaux (also semantic tableaux)prove X - -~  Y by constructing a counterexam-pie of X K: ~Y.
In fact, Beth tableaux inducepartial  semantics in the sense that there maybe counterexamples ven if a branch remainsopen.
Let X and Y be sets of formulas, andA and B be formulas.
And we write X b Yto mean that Y is provable from X.
Van Ben-there's part ial  semantics for classical logic canbe axiomatized by the Gentzen calculus, whichhas the axiom of the form:X, A P A, Yand the following sequent rules:(Weakening) X bY  ~ X, A F A, Y.
(Cut) X, Ab  Y and XF  A ,Y=--~ X F Y.
(~R) X, AbY  ~ Xb~A,Y .
(~L) XPA,  Y ~=~ X,~At -Y .(&R.)
X P Y, h and X F Y ,B=-.~ Xt -Y ,  A & B.
(&L) X ,A ,B  bY  ---.s X ,A  &B P Y.
(vR) XPA,  B ,Y  ~ XPAvB,  Y.
(vL) X ,A  F Y and X, B t- Y==> X, AVBbY.Van Benthem's formulation can be extendedfor part ial  logics.
Because such an extension1115uses the notion of partial valuations, it is notdifficult to recast the tzeatment for DRT.Let V be a partial valuation assigning 0, 1to some atomic formula p. Now, we set V(p)= 1 for p on the left-hand side and V(p) = 0for p on the right-hand side in an open branchof Beth tableaux.
This construction can beeasily accommodated to sequent calculi.
Then,we can define the following two consequencerelations:(C1) for all V, if V(Pre) = 1then V(Cons) = 1,(C2) for all V, if V(Pre) = 1then V(Cons) # 0,where Pre and Cons stand for premises (an-tecedent) and conclusion (succedent) of a se-qnent, respectively.
In a classical setting, (C1)and (C2) coincide.
It is not, however, the casefor partial logics.The Gentzen calculus G1 for C1 is obtain-able from the above system without right (~)-rule by introducing the following rules:(~R)  X~-A ,Y  ~ XP~A,Y .
(~L)  X, AF -Y  ~ X ,~-A~-Y .aR) x ~A, YX ~- ~(A & B), Y.
(~ &L) X,,-~A F- Y and X, ~B ~- YX, ~(A & B) ~- Y.
(,-~VR) XF- ~A,Y  and X~- NB, YX P --~(A V B), Y.
(~ VL) X, ,-~A, ~B t- Yx, ~(A v B) t- Y.Van Benthem (1986) showed that G1 is a Gentzentype axiomatization of C1.
To guarantee a cut-.free formulation, we need to modify van Ben-them's original system.
We denote by GC1 thesequent calculus for GC1, which contains theaxioms of the form: (A1) A }- A and (A2) A,--~A ~-, with the right and left rules for (&),(V), (~) ,  (~ &) and (~ V) together with(Weakening) and (Cut).
It is shown that GC1is equivalent o G1 without any difficulty.
Asa consequence, we have:Theorem 1C1 can be axiomatized by GC1.The Gentzen system GC2 for C2 can be ob-tained from (GC1) by adding the next axiom:(A3) A, ~A.Theorem 2C2 can be axiomatized by GC2.There are alternative ways to define con-sequence relations by means of sequent calculi.For example, it is possible to give the followingalternate definitions.
(C3) for aH V, if V(Pre) -- 1then V(Cons) = 1and if V(Cons) = 0then V(Pre) = 0.The new definition obviously induces inconsis-tent valuations.
The Gentzen system GC3 isobtainable from GC1 by replacing (A2) by thefollowing new axiom:(A4) A, -A  ~ B, ~B.Theorem $C3 can be axiomatized by GC3.4.
Re la t ion  to Par t ia l  LogicsIn this section, we compare the proposed Gentzensystems with some existing partial logics, inparticular, three-valued and four-valued log-ics in the literature; see Urquhart (1986).
Tomake connections to partial logics clear, we ex-tend DRL with weak negation "--" to expressthe lack of truth rather than verification of fal-sity in discourses.
We denote the extended lan-guage by EDRL.
In the presence of two kindsof negation, we can also define two kinds ofimplication as material implications.
We needthe next rules for weak negation:( -R)  X, A ~- V ~ X ~- -~A, Y.X A, X, Y.In fact, these rules provide a new consequencereation of EDRL denoted by ~EDRL.
Ourfirst result is concerned with the relationship ofGC1 and Kleene's (1952) strong three-valuedlogic KL, namelyTheorem 4The consequence r lations of GC1 and KL areequivalent.From this theorem, EDRL can be identifiedwith the extended Kleene logic EKL.
Let A-~,, B be an abbreviation of ~A V B.
Then, wecan also interpret Lukasiewicz's three-valued1116logic L3.
In fact, the Lukasiewicz huplicationD can be defined as follows:A D B =a~t (A -~0 B) & (~B-* ,~ ~A)which impliest=EKL h D B iff A ~:EKL B and ~B ~EKL~i .This is closely related to the consequence r la-tion C3.Theorem 5AFc,  a B iff ~EKL A D B.If we drop (A2) from GC1, we have the sequentcalculus GCI - ,  which is shown to be equiva-lent to Belnap's (1977) four-valued logic BEL.Theorem 6~-BEL = ~GC1-"The four-valued logic BEL can handle bothincomplete and inconsistent information.
Webelieve that four-vaNed semantics is plausibleas a basis for representational semantics likeDRT, which should torelate inconsistent infor-mation in discourses.
In view of these results,we can develop some versions of DRT whichmay correspond to current three-valued andfour-vahed logics; see Akama (1994).5.
Conc lus ionsWe have studied a proof-theoretic foundationfor DRT based on consequence relations de-fined by part ia l  semantics.
These consequencerelations yield alternative versions of DRT tobe used for different applications.
We havenoted some connections between these relationsand part ia l  logics, in particular three-valuedand four-valued logics.
We believe that thesignificance of our work lies in reformulatingDRT in sequent calculi to be easily applied tocomputational linguistics.There are several topics that can be furtherdeveloped.
First, we should give a more de-tailed discussion of what sort of completenessproof is involved, although we have establishedsome correspondence r sults.
Second, it is veryinteresting to show how the proposed conse-quence relations affect DRT in mo~e detailedways.
Third, we need to extend the presentwork for the predicate case to take care to cap-ture the dynamic effect of the quantificationalstructure of DRT.ReferencesAkama, S.
