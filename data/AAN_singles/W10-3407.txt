The SCD configurations are ap-plied successively on each dictionary en-try to identify its lexicographic segments(the first SCD configuration), to extractits sense tree (the second configuration),and to parse its atomic sense definitions(the third one).
Using previous results onDLR (The Romanian Thesaurus ?
newformat), the present paper adapts and ap-plies the SCD-based technology to otherfour large and complex thesauri: DAR(The Romanian Thesaurus ?
old format),TLF (Le Tr?sor de la Langue Fran?aise),DWB (Deutsches W?rterbuch ?GRIMM), and GWB (G?the-W?rterbuch).
This experiment is illu-strated on significantly large parsed en-tries of these thesauri, and proved the fol-lowing features: (1) the SCD-based me-thod is a completely formal grammar-free approach for dictionary parsing, withefficient (weeks-time adaptable) model-ing through sense hierarchies and parsingportability for a new dictionary.
(2) SCD-configurations separate and run sequen-tially and independently the processes oflexicographic segment recognition, sensetree extraction, and atomic definitionparsing.
(3) The whole DEP process withSCD-configurations is optimal.
(4) SCD-configurations, through sense markerclasses and their dependency hyper-graphs, offer an unique instrument of lex-icon construction comparison, sense con-cept design and DEP standardization.1 IntroductionThe general idea behind parsing a large dictio-nary can be reduced to transforming a raw textentry into an indexable linguistic resource.
Thus,for each dictionary entry, a structured representa-tion of its senses has to be created, together witha detailed description of the entry?s form: i.e.morphology, syntax, orthography, phonetics, lex-ical semantics, etymology, usage, variants etc.The aim of this paper is to present an efficientdictionary entry parsing (DEP) method, based onSegmentation-Cohesion-Dependency (SCD) con-figurations (Curteanu, 2006), applied on a set offive large and complex dictionaries: DLR (TheRomanian Thesaurus ?
new format), DAR (TheRomanian Thesaurus ?
old format), TLF (LeTr?sor de la Langue Fran?aise), DWB(Deutsches W?rterbuch ?
GRIMM), and GWB(G?the-W?rterbuch).The paper is structured in 8 sections: Section 2presents the state of the art in DEP, with an em-phasis on the comparison between the proposedmethod and other dictionary parsing strategies,before detailing the SCD-based proposed methodin Section 3.
The following sections present theapplication of the proposed method to the fivedictionaries.
The paper ends with a discussion on38comparative results and development directionsconcerning optimality, portability, standardiza-tion, and dictionary networks.2 Dictionary Entry ParsingNatural language text parsing is a complexprocess whose prerequisite essential stage is athorough modeling of the linguistic process to bedeveloped, i.e.
the structures and relations aimedto constitute the final result of the analysis.
Simi-larly, for DEP, the semantics of the lexical struc-tures, the sense markers, and the hierarchies (de-pendencies) between sense structures must bespecified.Standard approaches to dictionary entry pars-ing (referred to from now on as standard DEP),such as the one used by (Neff and Boguraev,1989), the LexParse system presented in (Hauserand Storrer, 1993; Kammerer, 2000; Lemnitzerand Kunze, 2005), or lexicographic grammars, asthose presented in (Curteanu & Amihaesei, 2004;Tufis et al, 1999), recognize the sense / subsensedefinitions in a strictly sequential manner, alongwith the incremental building of the entry sensetree.
The interleaving of the two runningprocesses is the main source of errors and ineffi-ciency for the whole DEP process.Both the standard DEP (Figure 1) and ourproposed method based on SCD-configurations(Figure 2) involve the following three runningcycles and four essential phases for extracting thesense-tree structure from a dictionary:[A1], [B1] ?
parsing the lexicographic seg-ments of an entry;[A2], [B2] ?
parsing the sense-descriptionsegment of the dictionary entry, at the level ofexplicitly defined senses, until and not includingthe contents of the atomic definitions / senses; atthis stage, the sense-tree of the sense-descriptionsegment is built having (sets of) atomic senses /definitions in their leaf-nodes.

Standard dictionary entry parsingThe main drawback of the classical, standardDEP, is the embedding of the parsing cycles,[A1] [A2] [A3] ... [/A3] [/A2] [/A1], derivedfrom the intuitive, but highly inefficient parsingstrategy based on the general Depth-First search-ing.
After presenting the SCD-based dictionaryparsing method, section 3.2. compares the pars-ing cycles and phases of standard DEP to theones of SCD-based DEP.3 Parsing with SCD ConfigurationsThe SCD configuration(s) method is aprocedural, recognition-generation computa-tional device, that is distinct from the traditionaland cumbersome formal grammars, being able tosuccessfully replace them for several tasks ofnatural language parsing, including text freeparsing (Curteanu, 2006) and thesauri parsing(Curteanu et al, 2008).
For SCD-based parsing,the semantics and the linguistic modeling of thetext to be analyzed should be clearly specified ateach parsing level, and implemented within thefollowing components of each SCDconfiguration (hereafter, SCD-config):?
A set of marker classes: a marker is aboundary for a specific linguistic category(e.g.
A., I., 1., a)., etc.).
Markers arejoined into marker classes, with respect to39their functional similarity (e.g.
{A., B., C.,?
}, {1., 2., 3., ?
}, {a)., b)., ?});?
A hypergraph-like hierarchy that estab-lishes the dependencies among the markerclasses;?
A searching (parsing) algorithm.Once an SCD configuration is defined, parsingwith the SCD configuration implies identifyingthe markers in the text to be parsed, constructingthe sequences of markers and categories, recog-nizing the marked text structures (spans withinthe bounding markers) corresponding to the SCDconfiguration semantics, and classifying themaccording to the marker sequences within thepre-established hierarchy assigned to that SCDconfiguration.
The last step settles the dependen-cies and correlations among the parsed textualstructures.
Identifying the lexicographic seg-ments of an entry, the syntactic and semanticstructure of each segment, the senses, definitionsand their corresponding markers, is the result ofan in-depth lexical semantics analysis.
Designingthe classes and the hypergraph structure of theirdependencies are essential cognitive aspects ofworking with SCD configurations, and need tobe pre-established for each dictionary.Within the parsing process, each SCD confi-guration, i.e.
marker classes, hierarchy, andsearching algorithm, is completely commandedby its attached semantics.
The semantically-driven parsing process, either for free or specia-lized texts, consists in a number of SCD configu-rations applied sequentially (in cascade), eachone on a different semantic level.
The semanticlevels (each one driving an SCD configuration)are subsuming each other in a top-down, mono-tonic manner, starting with the most general se-mantics of the largest text span, until the mostspecific level.3.1 SCD Configurations for DEPThe SCD-based process for DEP consists in threeSCD configurations, applied sequentially on thelevels and sublevels of the dictionary entry,where each level should be monotonic at the lex-ical-semantics subsumption relation.The task of applying the SCD configurationsto DEP requires knowing the semantics of thecorresponding classes of sense and definitionmarkers, together with their hierarchical repre-sentation.The first SCD configuration (SCD-config1) isdevoted to the task of obtaining the partition ofthe entry lexicographic segments (Hauser &Storrer, 1993).
Since usually there are no depen-dency relations between lexicographic segments,SCD-config1 is not planned to establish the de-pendency relations (cycle [A1] in Fig.
1, or cycle[B1] in Fig.
2).The second important task of DEP is to parseeach lexicographic segment according to its spe-cific semantics and linguistic structure.
The mostprominent lexicographic segment of each entry isthe sense-description one, the central operationbeing the process of extracting the sense treefrom the segment.
This is the purpose of thesecond SCD configuration (denotedSCD-config2), corresponding exactly to theDSSD parsing algorithm in (Curteanu et al,2008), which, for the DLR sense trees, has a pre-cision of 91.18%.
In order to refine the lexical-semantics of primary senses, one has to descend,under secondary senses, into the definitions anddefinition examples, which constitute the textspans situated between two sequentially-relatednodes of the parsed sense tree.
This SCD confi-guration is represented as cycle [B2] in Fig.
2.The third step of DEP parsing (cycle [B3] inFig.
2) is represented by the configurationSCD-config3, needed to complete the DEP.SCD-config3 consists in a specific set of markerclasses for the segmentation at dictionary defini-tions, the hypergraph-like hierarchy of theclasses of markers for these sense definitions,and the parsing algorithm to establish the depen-dencies among atomic senses / definitions.
As aprerequisite groundwork, an adequate modelingof the sense definitions is needed and the seg-mentation of definitions is implemented as anessential step to establish the dependency-by-subsumption among the sense types of the consi-dered thesaurus.
The final result of the entryparsing process should be the sequential applica-tion of the SCD-config1, SCD-config2, andSCD-config3 configurations.3.2 A Structural Analysis: Standard DEP vs.SCD ConfigurationsA pilot experiment of parsing with SCD configu-rations was its application to the DLR thesaurusparsing (Curteanu et al, 2008); the process ofsense tree building has been completely detached40and extracted from the process of sense definitionparsing.The sense-tree parsing with SCD-based DEPcycles and phases is summarized in pseudo-codein Fig.
2 and comparative Table 1 below.[B1].

SCD-based dictionary entry parsingStandard DEP SCD-based DEP(Phase_1;Phase_2(Phase_3;Phase_4))(Phase_1;Phase_4)(Phase_2;Phase_3)Table 1: Dictionary parsing phases instandard DEP and SCD-based DEPTable 1 presents the ordering of the dictionaryparsing phases in the standard DEP strategy (thefour phases are embedded) and the SCD-basedDEP strategy (the phases are organized in a li-nearly sequential order).Since the process of sense tree construction(cycle Phase_1 + Phase_4) has been made com-pletely detachable from the parsing of the (atom-ic) sense definitions (cycle Phase_2 + Phase_3),the whole SCD-based DEP process is much moreefficient and robust.
An efficiency feature of theSCD-based parsing technique is that, workingexclusively on sense marker sequences, outputsof [B2] and [B3] cycles in Fig.
2 (i.e.
sense trees)are obtained either the sense definition parsingprocess succeeds or not, either correct or not!These properties of the new parsing methodwith SCD configurations have been effectivelysupported by the parsing experiments on largeRomanian, French, and German dictionaries.4 Romanian DLR ParsingThe study of the application of SCD-configuration to DEP started with the analysis ofthe DLR parsing (Curteanu et al, 2008).

However, DLR isencoded by default inheritance rules of senses(definitions), acting on all the node levels of thesense / definition trees.The sense tree parser (output of SCD-config2)was tested on more than 500 dictionary entries oflarge and medium sizes.
The success rate was91.18%, being computed as a perfect match be-tween the output of the program and the goldstandard.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that anentry with only one incorrect parse (i.e.
one nodein the sense tree attached incorrectly) was consi-dered to be erroneously parsed in its entirety, anapproach which disregards all the other correctlyattached nodes in that entry.A first source of parsing errors is the non-monotony of the marker values: ?A.

?.For evaluating SCD-config3, 52 dictionary en-tries of various sizes were used as a gold stan-dard, totaling a number of approximately 2000chunks and 22,000 words.
The results are givenin Table 2.
Upon further analysis of the evalua-tion results, the most frequent errors were foundto be due to faulty sigle (abbreviation of thesource of examples) segmentation.
A detailedanalysis of the error types for the DLR dictionaryis discussed in (Curteanu et al, 2009).EvaluationTypePrecision RecallF-measureExact Match 84.32% 72.09% 77.73%Overlap 92.18% 91.97% 92.07%Table 2: Evaluation results for segmentation ofDLR atomic sense elementsCorrecting the acquisition of sigles leads to a94.43% f-measure for exact match (the numberof correctly identified sense and definition units)and a 98.01% f-measure for overlap (the numberof correctly classified words in each entry).
Toachieve the DLR parsing process completely, thelast operation to be executed is to establish thedependency relations between atomic senses /definitions, under all the sense nodes in the com-puted sense-tree of the entry.
Currently, the DLRis parsed almost completely, including at atomicsenses / definitions, the lexicographic segmentsand sense-trees being obtained with a correctnessrate above 90% for explicitly marked sense defi-nitions.5 Romanian DAR ParsingThe structure of the main lexicographical seg-ments in DAR is outlined below:I.
The French Translation segment, denotedFreSeg, contains the French translations of thelemma and the main sense hierarchy of the entryword.
The translation of the sense structure intoRomanian and the complete description of thesense tree in DAR are in a subsumption relation.In some cases, the French translation may notexist for specific Romanian lemmas.II.
The general description segment (RomSeg)is composed of several paragraphs and containsmorphologic, syntactic, semantic, or usage in-formation on the entry word.
RomSeg usuallystarts with the entry word in italics (otherwise,the entry word occurs in the first row of the firstparagraph).III.
The third segment of a DAR entry, calledSenseSeg, is the lexical-semantic description ofthe entry word.
SenseSeg is the main objective ofthe lexicographic analysis of the entry parsing inorder to obtain its sense tree.IV.
The fourth segment of a DAR, NestSeg,contains one or more ?nests?, which are seg-ments of text describing morphological, syntac-tic, phonological, regional, etc.
variants of anentry, sometimes with an attached description ofthe specific senses.
The structure of the DARnest segment is similar to that of a typical DARentry, and the recursive nature of DAR entriescomes from the sense parsing of nest segments.42V.
The fifth segment of DAR entries, denotedEtymSeg, contains etymological descriptions ofthe entry word and is introduced by an etymolo-gy-dash (long dash ???).
Among the five seg-ments of a DAR entry, the only compulsory onesare FreSeg and SenseSeg.
The other three seg-ments are optional in the entry description, de-pending on each entry word.5.1 DAR Marker Classes and HierarchyThe priority ordering of DAR marker classes is:1.
Capital letters (LatCapLett_Enum): A., B., ...2.
Capital roman numerals (LatCap-Numb_Enum): I., II., ...3.
Arabic numerals (ArabNumb_Enum): 10., 20.These markers introduce the primary senses, in asimilar manner to those in DLR.4.
For introducing secondary senses, DAR usesthe same sense markers used in DLR for defini-tions of type MorfDef, RegDef, BoldDef, ItalDef,SpecDef, SpSpecDef, and DefExem, and a set ofmarkers specific to DAR: ||, |, #, ?.5.
According to the level of the lexical-semanticdescription, DAR uses literal enumeration ontwo levels: (5.a) lowercase Latin letters (LatS-mallLett_Enum): a.
), b.
), ?
(5.b) a LatSmallLett_Enum can have another enumeration, usinglowercase Greek letters (GreSmallLett_Enum):?.

4.5.2 Special problems in DAR parsingA first difficulty for parsing the DAR lexico-graphic segments is the occurrence of theNew_Paragraph (NewPrg).
For NewPrg markerFig.
4: Dependency hypergraph for DARrecognition we used an implicit level of enumera-tion, LatSmaNum_Enum discriminating the caseswhen NewPrg is (or not) accompanied by anoth-er type of DAR sense marker.The second difficult problem in DAR parsingis the process of refining the NewPrg markerwith literal enumerations (LatSmallLett_Enum),which can be in turn refined by an implicit enu-meration using NewPrg.
This has been solved byinterpreting the sense levels for enumerationsaccording to their context.Using SCD configurations, we have parsed 37DAR entries of large and medium sizes.
The re-sults of the DAR parsing have been evaluatedmanually, and we estimated the parsing precisionas really promising, taking into account the diffi-cult problems raised by DAR.
The lack of a goldstandard for DAR entries did not allow perform-ing an automatic evaluation at this moment.DAR Entry Parsing (Excerpt):- <entry>- <lexsegm value="FreSeg."

The structure of TLF lex-icographic segments, obtained with theSCD-config1, is relatively simple.
A TLF entrycommences with the sense-description segment,optionally (but very frequently) followed by apackage of ?final?
segments, introduced by spe-cific labels, as in the pattern:REM.

Dependency hypergraph of TLFsense marker classesCross-linguistic hints involving TLF entryparsing with SCD configurations: (a) A newsense marker (compared to DLR) is ???
(inherit-ance- dash), aiming to signal the presence of aninherited sense.
(b) When ???
occurs after anoth-er TLF marker, the ???
role is to inherit a parentsense (either regent or not) from the sense-tree.
(c) When ???
begins at new paragraph (NewPrg),its role is of a intermediary subsense, inheritingthe meaning of the regent (sub)sense.
(d) Another new TLF marker is ?

One ofthe reasons of these very promising results forTLF parsing may be the regularity and standar-dization of the TLF entry texts.
An automatic,precise evaluation of the SCD-based parser wasnot possible since we are missing currently agold-corpus of TLF entries.TLF Entry Parsing (Excerpt):- <entry>- <lexsegm value="SenseSeg."

One specialfeature is that DWB and GWB lexicographicsegments are composed of two parts: a first (op-tional) root-sense subsegment, and the segmentbody, which contain the explicit sense markers,easily recognizable.
For DWB, the parsing oflexicographic segments is not at all a comfortabletask since they are defined by three distinctmeans:(A) After the root-sense of a DWB entry, orafter the root-sense of a lexicographic segment,(a list of) italicized-and-spaced key-words areplaced to constitute the label of the lexicographicsegment that follows.
Samples of such key-wordlabels for DWB lexicographic segments are:?Form, Ausbildung und Ursprung?, ?Formen?,?Ableitungen?,?Verwandtschaft?,?Verwandtschaft und Form?,?Formelles und Etymologisches?, ?Gebrauch?,?Herkunft?, ?Grammatisches?, etc., or, for DWBsense-description segment: ?Bedeutung undGebrauch?
(or just ?Bedeutung?).

(C) The third (and most frequent) way to iden-tify the lexical description segment(s) of a DWBentry is simply the lack of a segment label at thebeginning of the sense description segment.
Bydefault, after the entry root-sense segment (whichcan be reduced to the Latin translation of theGerman lemma) the sense-description segmentcomes, without any ?Bedeutung?
label, introduc-ing explicit sense markers and definitions.7.1 German DWB and GWB DependencyHypergraphs.

GWB dependency hypergraphA number of 17 very large DWB entries havebeen parsed only with SCD-config1 and SCD-config2.
We appreciate on this small but signifi-cant excerpt of DWB entries that parsing of thesense description segment at sense trees is per-formed with a high precision, but delimitation ofthe lexicographic (sub-)segments and labels is amore difficult problem.
The lack of a DWB entrygold corpus did not allow a precise, automatedevaluation of the parser.8 Directions: Optimal Lexicon Design,Standardization, Lexicon NetworksThe special features of parsing with SCD confi-gurations (SCD-configs) are: ?
SCD-configs is acompletely formal grammar-free approach whichinvolves simple, efficient (weeks-time adapta-ble), thus portable modeling and programs.
?
Inall currently existing DEP methods, the sensetree construction of each entry is, more or less,recursively embedded and mixed within the defi-nition parsing procedures.
?
SCD-configs pro-vides a lexical-semantics refinement level oneach SCD-config.
?
SCD-configs separate andrun sequentially, on independent levels (viz.
con-figurations), the processes of lexicographic seg-ment recognition, sense tree extraction, andatomic definition parsing.
?
This makes thewhole DEP process with SCD-configs to be op-timal.
?
The sense marker classes and their de-pendency hypergraphs, specific to each thesau-rus, offer an unique instrument of lexicon con-46struction comparison, sense concept design andstandardization.
With the SCD parsing technique,one can easily compare the sense categories,their marking devices, the complexity and recur-siveness measure of the sense dependencyhypergraphs for each thesaurus.The cross-linguistic analysis of the five largethesauri showed the necessity of a careful lexi-cal-semantics modeling of each dictionary.Equally important, many semantic and lexico-graphic concepts such as sense markers and defi-nitions, (indexed) examples to definitions, senseand source references etc.
can be similar, adapta-ble, and transferable between correspondingSCD-configurations of different thesauri.The SCD-configs analysis pointed out theneed of a more general and adequate terminologyfor the lexical-semantics notions.
E.g., compar-ing the Romanian and French thesauri with theGerman ones, we decided that, while preservingthe definition type labels MorfDef, DefExem,SpecDef and SpSpecDef, we should change theRegDef into GlossDef, BoldDef into IdiomDef,ItalDef into CollocDef, and add the TLF IdxDe-fExem (an indexed DefExem) to the sense con-cept set.The future experiments will continue with newthesauri parsing: Russian, Spanish, Italian, butthe true challenge shall be oriented towards Chi-nese / Japanese thesauri, aiming to establish athorough lexical-semantics comparison and alanguage-independent, portable DEP technologybased on SCD configurations.
A further devel-opment would be to align the Romanian thesaurisense and definition types to TEI P5 standards(XCES, 2007), and to design an optimal andcross-linguistic compatible network of Romanianelectronic dictionaries, similar to a very goodproject of dictionary network, i.e.
the GermanWoerterbuch-Netz (with links to TLFi entriestoo), whose twelve component lexicons includeDWB and GWB.Acknowledgement.
