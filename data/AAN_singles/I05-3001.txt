Aparticular Chinese character stringoccurring more than once in acorpus may be assigned differentsegmentations during asegmentation process.
Based onthese differences our approachoutputs the segmentation errorcandidates found in a segmentedcorpus and then on which thesegmentation errors are identifiedmanually.
Segmentation error rateof a gold standard corpus can begiven using our method.
In PekingUniversity (PK) and AcademicSinica (AS) test corpora of SpecialInterest Group for ChineseLanguage Processing (SIGHAN)Bakeoff1, 1.29% and 2.26%segmentation error rates aredetected by our method.
Theseerrors decrease the F-measure ofSIGHAN Bakeoff1 baseline test by1.36% in PK test data and 1.93% inAS test data respectively.This work was done while Chengjie Sun was visitingMicrosoft Research Asia.1 IntroductionSIGHAN Bakeoff11 proposed an automaticmethod to evaluate the performance ofdifferent Chinese word segmentationsystems on four distinct data sets.
Thismethod makes the performance of differentChinese word segmentation systemscomparable and greatly promotes thetechnology of Chinese Word Segmentation.However, the quality of the referencecorpora in the evaluation should be paidmore attention because they provide trainingmaterial for participants and they serve as agold standard for evaluating theperformance of participant systems.This paper presents a semi-automaticmethod to detect segmentation errors in amanually annotated Chinese corpus in orderto improve its quality further.
Especially asegmentation error rate of a gold standardcorpus could be obtained with our approach.As we know a particular Chinese characterstring occurring more than once in a corpusmay be assigned different segmentations.Those differences are considered assegmentation inconsistencies by someresearchers (Wu, 2003; Chen, 2003).Segmentation consistency is also consideredas one of the quality criteria of an annotatedChinese corpus (Sun, 1999).
But in order toprovide a more clearer description of thosesegmentation differences we define a new1 http://www.sighan.org/bakeoff2003/1term, segmentation variation, to replace theoriginal one, segmentation inconsistency.Our approach of spotting segmentationerrors within an annotated corpus consists oftwo steps: (1) automatically listing thesegmentation error candidates withsegmentation variations found in anannotated corpus, (2) spotting segmentationerrors within those candidates manually.The target of this approach is to count thenumber of error tokens in the corpus andgive the segmentation error rate of thecorpus, which is not given for any goldstandard corpus in Bakeoff1.The remainder of this paper is structuredas follows.
In section 2, we discriminate thekinds of segmentation inconsistencies in testsets of SIGHAN Bakeoff1.
In section 3,segmentation variation is defined and ourapproach to detect segmentation errors in amanually annotated corpus is proposed.
Insection 4 we conduct baseline experimentsof PK and AS corpora with revised test setsin order to show exactly the impact ofsegmentation errors in the test sets ofBakeoff1.
Section 5 is a brief conclusion.2 Segmentation inconsistencyIn the close test of Bakeoff1, participantscould only use training material from thetraining data for the particular corpus beingtesting on.
No other material was allowed(Sproat and Emerson, 2003).
As we knowthat the test data should be consistent withthe training data based on a generaldefinition of Chinese words.
That is if wecollect all words seen in the training dataand store them into a lexicon, then eachword in a test set is either a lexicon word oran OOV (out of vocabulary) word (Gao etal., 2003).
In another word, if a characterstring has been treated as one word, i.e.
alexicon word, in the training data, the sameoccurrence should be taken in thecorresponding test data unless it is a CAS(combination ambiguity string) and viceversa.As we all know that a CAS like "??
[cai2-neng2]" may be segmented into oneword or two words depending on differentcontexts.
Thus segmentation inconsistencylike "??"
(talent) and "??"
(only can)could both be correct segmentations in a text.Therefore ?segmentation inconsistency?should not be regarded as incorrectsegmentations in general and should beclarified further.
If one wants to discuss thesegmentation errors based on segmentationinconsistencies, then from which those CASinstances should be excluded.If we exclude CAS words in ourinvestigation temporary then for a non-CAScharacter string, there are four kinds ofsituations violating the general definition ofChinese word, also called lexicon drivenprinciple in automatic word segmentationtechnology:S1.
A character string is segmentedinconsistently within a training data;S2.
A character string is segmentedinconsistently within a test data;S3.
A character string is segmentedinconsistently between a test data and its trainingdata.
This situation could be divided into thefollowing two cases further:S3.1 A word identified in a training data hasbeen segmented into multiple words incorresponding test data;S3.2 A word identified in a test data has beensegmented into multiple words incorresponding training data.Chen (2003) describes inconsistencyproblem found in cases S1, S2 and S3.1 ofPK corpora.
For example, he gives theamount of unique text fragments that havetwo or more segmentations within PKtraining data, within PK test data and alsobetween PK training data and PK test data.2But those CAS words have not beenexcluded in his description.
Ignoring thecontent of inconsistencies the influenceabout the number of segmentationinconsistencies of a particular corpus will beexaggerated greatly.
In addition, Chen didn?tconsider the case of S3.2 which could alsoaffect the evaluation significantly accordingto the lexicon driven principle.
53 wordtypes found in case 3.2 (refer to Appendixpart 2) were totally treated as OOV words inBakeoff1 which impacts the identification ofthose authentic new words in the task.
Sothe issue of segmentation inconsistency inreference corpora needs furtherinvestigation.As mentioned before, in commonknowledge "segmentation inconsistency" isa derogatory term.
But our investigationshows that most of segmentationinconsistencies found in an annotated corpusturned out to be correct segmentations ofCASs.
Therefore it is not an appropriatetechnique term to assess the quality of anannotated corpus.
Besides, with the conceptof "segmentation inconsistency" it is hard todistinguish the different inconsistentcomponents within an annotated corpus andfinally count up the number of segmentationerrors exactly.
In the next section wepropose a new term "segmentationvariation" to replace the original one,"segmentation inconsistency".3 Segmentation variation3.1 DefinitionDefinition 1: In annotated corpora C, a setof f(W, C) is defined as: f(W, C) = {allpossible segmentations that word W has incorpora C}.Definition 2: W is a segmentationvariation type (segmentation variationin short, hereafter) with respect to C iff|f(W, C)|>1.Definition 3: An instance of element in f(W,C) is called a variation instance.
Thus asegmentation variation (type) consists ofmore than one variation instances incorpora C. And a variation instance mayinclude one or more than one tokens.Definition 4: If a variation instance is anincorrect segmentation, it is called anerror instance (EI).The definitions of segmentation variation,variation instance and error instance (EI)clearly distinguish those inconsistentcomponents, so we can count the number ofsegmentation errors (in tokens) exactly.The term variation is also used to expressother annotation inconsistency in a corpusby other researchers.
For example,Dickinson and Meurers (2003) usedvariation to describe POS (Part-of-Speech)inconsistency in an annotated corpus.Example 1: Segmentation variations(Bakeoff1 PK corpus):Word "??
[deng3-tong2]" is segmented as"??"
(equal) and "??"
(et al with).Word "???
[huang2-jin1-zhou1]" issegmented as "???"
(golden week) and "???"
(gold week).Word "????
[bing1-qing1-yu4-jie2]" issegmented as "????"
(pure and noble)and "????"
(ice clear jade clean).In example 1, Words like ???
?, ????
?
and ?????
?
are segmentationvariation types.
Segmentations ????
and???
?
are two variation instances ofsegmentation variation ????.
Besides, thevariation instance ????
consists of twotokens ???
and ???.
While the variationinstance "?
?
?
?"
consists of fourtokens "?
", "?
", "?"
and "?
".The existence of segmentation variationsin corpora lies in two reasons: 1) ambiguity:variation type W has multiple possiblesegmentations in different contexts, or 2)3error: W has been wrongly segmented whichcould be judged by a given lexicon.Example 2: A segmentation variationcaused by ambiguity (Bakeoff1 PK corpus):Segmentation variation: "??
[guo2-du1]"Variation instances: "??"
(capital) and "?
[guo2] ?
[dou1]" (countries all).
They areboth correct segmentations in followingsentences:???????????
??(Constantinople became the capital ofByzantium.)????????????????
??(Both countries all advocate solvingdisagreements by conversation andnegotiation.
)Example 3: Segmentation variations causedby error (Bakeoff1 PK corpus):Segmentation variation: "????
[jin4-guan3-ru2-ci4]"Variation instances: "????"
(still) and "????"
(despite so).Segmentation variation: ?????
?Variation instances: ??????
and ?????
?In the rest of the paper, a segmentationvariation caused by ambiguity is called aCAS variation and a segmentation variationcaused by error is called a non-CASvariation.
Each kind of segmentationvariations may include error instances (EIs).
*: The number in the bracket is the amount caused by CAS.Table 1 segmentation variations types, instances and EIs in PK test data3.2 Finding error instances (EIs)How to find the segmentation variations incorpora?
Following is the algorithm offinding segmentation variations.
Accordingto our definition, the algorithm is quitestraightforward.
It takes two segmentedChinese corpora (reference corpus andcorpus to be checked) and outputs a list ofsegmentation variation instances betweenthe two corpora2.Algorithm steps:2 These two corpora could be also regarded as oneunique corpus: the corpus to be checked.
A large scalereference corpus is always helpful in spotting morevariations in the corpus to be checked.1.
Extract all the multi-character wordsin reference corpus and store their positionsin reference corpus respectively;2.
Find the words that be segmented intoN parts (N is from 2 to the length of currentword) in the corpus to be checked.
Store thepositions of those segmentations found inthe corpus to be checked;3.
Output a list of variation instanceswith their contexts between two corpora.We use ?AutoCheck?
to stand for theprocessing using the algorithm above.
Inorder to find the segmentation variationswithin one corpus, we can also make thereference corpus and the corpus to bechecked be the same corpus.
Data in Table 1are obtained through ?AutoCheck + manualSituationWithin testdataBetween:One-to-MultBetween:Mult-to-One# of variation type 21 92 228# of variation instances 87 129 506# of EIs* 12(3) 68(4) 77# of error tokens* 28(6) 142(8) 774checking?.
That is firstly running?AutoCheck?
3 times as shown in Table 2 toget the list of variation types and instancesin each situation respectively, and then EIsare found through manual checking.In Table 1, situations ?within test data?,?Between: One-to-Mult?
and ?Between:Mult-to-One?
correspond to the SituationsS2, S3.1 and S3.2 described in Section 2.Here we still include CAS segmentations inorder to take a close look at the distributionof EIs in each kind of segmentationvariation.
We can see that in situation?Between: One-to-Mult?, there are only 4EIs caused by CAS among 68 EIs.
It is avery small fraction, so most of CASvariation instances are correct segmentationsin a manually checked corpus.Situation ReferencecorpusCorpus to becheckedWithin testdataPK test data PK test dataBetween:One-to-MultPK trainingdataPK test dataBetween:Mult-to-OnePK test data PK trainingdataTable 2 Inputs of different AutoCheck runsExcept ??
? ??
(gold week) most ofthe EIs in S2: ?within test data?
are alsofound in S3.1: ?Between Rne-to-Pult?3.
Thisis because in S3.1 the size of the referencecorpus (training set) is much greater than thecorpus to be checked (test set) so variationsfound in this case almost cover all of thosefound in S2 (test set only).
EIs in S3.2:?between: Pult-to-Rne?
are such strings thatthey are never considered as one word in PKtraining data while always identified as one3 ??
? ??

(golden week).word in PK test data.
For example, thesegmentation variation (type) " ?
?
[shang4-tu2]" occurs four times as one word????
(above picture) in test data, but threeof its variation instances "? ?"
(upperpicture) have been found in the training set.Thus, variation type "?? "
should beidentified as a segmentation error rather thanan OOV word as in Bakeoff1.
From Table 1,we can find 221 error tokens in all errorinstances (EIs) after removing the 26redundant ones in PK test data (17194tokens).
So, the error rate of PK test data is1.29%.Using the same method, we also find outthe 139 error instances (271 error tokens) inAS test data.
The error rate of AS test data is2.26% as shown in table 3.Table 3 shows the error rate of AS test setis 2.26% and it is higher than PK test datawhich is 1.29%.
So we believe that thereason why the evaluation result on AScorpus are higher than those on PK corpusof Bakeoff1 is not due to the segmentationquality of AS test data but because RI theOOV rate (0.022) in AS test data ZKLFK ismuch lower than PK test data (0.069).data PK test data AS test dataTotal tokens 17194 11985Error tokens 221 271Error rate 1.29% 2.26%Table 3 Segmentation errors in PK and AStest data?AutoCheck?
outputs a list of allvariation instances found in the corpus but itcan not judge whether a variation instance isEI or not.
Besides, the output of?AutoCheck?
doesn?t include thosesegmentation errors which are not instancesof any segmentation variation in a corpus.Two examples are given in Example 4.
It5means that ?AutoCheck+manual checking?4can not spot all segmentation errors in acorpus.
Despite of these disadvantages of?AutoCheck?, it is still a necessary assistantto find out almost all of the segmentationerrors in an annotated corpus for its effectivein finding segmentation error candidates.Example 4: Segmentation errors which arenot instances of any segmentation variation(Bakeoff1 PK corpus):??????g??????g???????????

?(?has become the largest scale agencysystem in the world)AutoCheck has been applied inpreparing the MSRA (Microsoft ResearchAsia) annotated corpora of Chinese wordsegmentation (MS corpora, hereafter) thatwere submitted to SIGHAN Bakeoff2 as oneof the data sets.
"AutoCheck+manualchecking" is applied as the principal way ofquality control on MS corpora.
Even onlytaking a manual check on those variationsoutput by the AutoCheck could provide anapproximate assessment about the quality ofthe annotated corpus.
The lower the numberof error instances (EIs) found in the outputlist the lower the segmentation error rate theannotated corpus reaches.
For example,there are 37 variation instances output byAutoCheck in an annotated document #25with 26K tokens in MS Corpora, in whichno EIs has been found manually.
Then thewhole document was reviewed thoroughlyby a person in which only two segmentationerrors (shown in Example 5) have beenfound.
Our practice shows that with the4 ?manual checking?
is restricted on the output listonly.
Therefore it is a very effective way to assessapproximately the quality of an annotated corpus.quality control method above thesegmentation error rate of MS corporareaches 0.1% in average at the worst cases.Example 5: Segmentation errors in #25Error 1: ?

(a).4 The impact to the evaluationcaused by segmentation errors incorpora of Bakeoff1In order to show the impact to theevaluation result caused by EIs existing intest data of Bakeoff1, we conduct thebaseline close test with PK and AS corpora,i.e.
we compile lexicons only containingwords in their training data and then use thelexicons with a forward maximum matchingalgorithm to segment their test datarespectively (Sproat and Emerson, 2003).Original and modified test data are used asgold standard in our baseline test.In table 4, reference data PK1 and AS1are the original PK test data and AS test data.Reference data PK2 and AS2 are obtainedafter correcting all segmentation errorsfound in their original data (Table 3).Results in Table 4 are the output ofBakeoff1 evaluation program.
Word count isthe number of tokens in reference data andthe change in word count is caused by ourmodification.
Table 4 shows the impact ofEIs in test data to the evaluation results.
We6can see the F measure increase to 0.879(0.933) from 0.867 (0.915) and the OOVratio is decrease to 0.065 (0.020) from 0.069(0.022) when all EIs are corrected in PK(AS) test data.Table 4 Baseline test results with original and revised PK and AS test data5 ConclusionA semi-automatic method to detectsegmentation errors in a manually annotatedChinese corpus is presented in this paper.The main contributions of this research are:?
Offer an effective way to spot thesegmentation errors in a manuallyannotated corpus and give thesegmentation error rate of thecorpus.?
Point out that segmentationinconsistency is not an appropriatetechnique term to assess thesegmentation quality of anannotated corpus and define theconcept of segmentation variationinstead to get the segmentation errorrate of a gold standard corpus.?
Show the influence to the evaluationresult caused by the segmentationerrors in a gold standard corpus.1.29% error rate of PK test data and2.26% error rate of AS test datadecrease the F-measure of theSIGHAN Bakeoff1 baseline test by1.36% and 1.93% respectively.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank the members of theNatural Language Computing Group atMicrosoft Research Asia, especially toacknowledge Jianfeng Gao, John Chen, andthe two anonymous reviewers for theirinsightful comments and suggestions.ReferencesAitao Chen.
