jpAbstractUser modeling is an iml>ortant COlnponents of dia-log systems.
Most previous approaches are rule-basedmethods, hi this paper, we proimse to represent usermodels through Bayesian networks.
Some advantagesof the Bayesian approach over the rule-based approachare as follows.
First, rules for updating user models arenot necessary because up<lating is directly performedby the ewduation of the network base<l on probal>ilitytheory; this provides us a more formal way of dealingwith uncertainties.
Second, the Bayesian network pro:rides more detailed information of users' knowledge,because the degree of belief on each concept is pro-vided in terms of prol~ability.
We prove these advan-tages through a prelinfinary experiment.1 IntroductionRecently many researchers have pointed out that usermodeling is important in the study of (tiMog sys-tems.
User n:o<h!ling does not just render a dialogsyst(,nl more cooperative, lint constitutes an indis-1)ensable l)rerequisite fin" any flexible (lialog in a wider<tomain\[9\].
The user models interact closely with allother components of the system and often cannot eas-ily be separated from them.
For examph,, the inl)utanMysis component refers to tile user's knowledge tosolve referentiM ambiguities, and tile output genera-tion component does the same for h,xical el,oices.The con<:epts are usually explained l>y showing theirrelations to the other known concepts.
Thus, for the<lialog system it is important o guess what the userknows (user's knowledge) in order to explain new con-cel)ts in terms of know,t concepts.
For examl/le , con:sider that tit(, system explains the location of a restau-rant to the user.
It might 1)e useless to tell the.
user theposition in terms of the Mlsolute <:oordinate system,since the user's mental model is not based on the ab-solute coordinate.
Therefore, the system should showthe relative location frmn the lo(:ation tit(' user alrea(lyknows.
It is difficult to predict which locations theuser, who l)erhaps is a stranger to the system, knows.Though the syst:em <:ouhl atteml)t o a('quire the in-formation l/y asking the user al)out her k,towle(lge, toomany questions may irritate the user.
Such a systemis considered mechanical and not helpful.
Therefore,tit(" system is required to guess the user's knowledgeby finding clues in the user's utterance and to refinethe user's model incrementally.In the user modeling component of UC\[5\], severalstereotyped user models which vary the user's levelof expertise were prepared beforehand and the appro-priate model was selected based o1: the user's utter-ances.
Ill the approach used by Wallis and Shortlifl'e\[12\], the expertise h,vel was assigned to all concepts inthe user model.
The system guessed the user's level,and the concepts with the expertise level lower thanher level are considered to be known by her.
Thisn:o(lel can deal with tit(.'
level of expertise more appro-priately than UC, because the system does not haveto prepare the nmltiple user nlodels for each expertiseh, vel.The approach of pr<.
'paring several user models andadoptit,g one, however, is an al>l>roximation f usermodeling.
The expertise level of tit(: user is continuousand, in general, the unique measuremelfl: of expertiselevel is not appropriate for some domMns, specificallythe domain of town guidance consi<lere<l in this paper,because the areas that  are known differ with the users.Another problem of user modeling is updating thenmdel as the (tialog progresses.
At the beginning of thediMogue the system cannot expect the user nm<M tobe accurate.
As the diMogue progresses the.
system canacquire clues of the user's knowledge fl'om his utter-anees.
Also, the system can assume that the conceptsmentioned are known to the user.
Thus.
updating theuser model shouhl 1)e performed incrementally.One difficulty of updating user nmdels is dealingwith uncertainties.
The clues that  can be obtainedfrom the user's utterances are uncertain, the iltfol'nla-tiol( may conlli<:t with what has been hi,rained, and, asa result, the user mo<lel may be revised.
The effects ofthe systtnn's explanation are also uncertain.
Further-more, reasoning about the user's kuowledge must beperformed Oil the basis of uncertainties.
Most previousapl)roaches to this prolflem are rule-based metho(ts.Cawsey \[2\] sorted the update rules in order of theirreliability and applied them in this order.

For general explanation, it is impor-tant to make a (:lear distinction between tile two user'sstates; knowing tile name of a conceI)t and knowing theother attril>nte of tile coucel)t. For example, supposethe user asked the following:"Where is FRISCO ?
"where FRISCO is the name of a record store.
Fromthis question, the system infers that the user knowsthe name of the store, but does not know its location.Now we will give a precise definition of our language.All the sentence, s in the language have the form( la, beI) : (co,,,t , .
, .t)where ( label ) is one of PRE ,  POST,  JUDGE,TOLD,  and TELL ,  and ( content ) is representedby a term ef tile first-order predicate' logic.
Anobject and an expertise field are represented byan atomic symbol, and an attr ibute of an objectis represented by a fimction syml)ol.
For exam-ple, store001(object) ,  records_col lector(expert isefield), l ocat ion(s tore001) (a t t r ibutc ) ,  and so forth.The user's knowledge about an attr ibute is repre-sented by five sentences, all having the same (content)representing t.he attr ibute, and one of the five labels.The sentenees labeled PRE,  express that  the userknows the attrilLutc t)rior to the <lialogue session, whilethose labeled POST,  express that the user has cometo know it during the session.
For instan<:e, PRE:  lo-ca t ion(s tore001)  means that the user have ah'eadyknows the h)catiou of s tore001 betorc the interactionstarts, whih.'
POST:  locat ion(s tore001)  means theuser has <:ome to know the location through the sys-tem's explanation.
The sentences labeled JUDGE,express the user's (:urrent knowledge and is usedto exploit tile user mo<lel by other coml><ments inthe dialogue system.
For instance, JUDGE:  loca-t ion(s tore001)  means the use.r now knows tit(.'
loca-tion of s tore001.
The sentences labele<l TOLD an(lTELL ,  express the evi<le.nce, gained by the user's ut-terance and the system's explanation.
F<Lr instance,TOLD:  name(s tore001)  means the user has iLL-dicated by the clues that she knows the name ofs tore001,  while TELL :  name(s tore001)  means thesystem has explai,m<t the name.
For exception, in thecase of location, the form TELL :  locat ion(X) (whcreX is some obje(:t \[l)) is not usc<l because a locationis explained in terms of the relative h)cation of an-other object.
Instead, the form TELL :  re la t ion(X ,Y)(where X and Y are some ol)ject IDs) is used.Tit(.'
sentences representing objects and exi)ertiscfields have only the label PRE .
The sentence repre-senting an object (e.g.
PRE:  store001)  means thatthe user knows the object, that  is she knows ,nost ofthe attr ibutes of the object.
The sentence represent-ing an expertise rich\[ (e.g.
PRE:  records_co l lector )means thai: the user is an exl)ert of the field, that isshe knows the objects related to the expertise field.3.2 Constructing the NetworksAs mentioned, arcs of the Bayesian network representdirect probablistic influence between linked variables.Tim directionality of the arcs is essential for rei)resent-ing nontransitive dependencies.
In order to representthe knowledge in terms of Bayesian Network, we mustinterpret he qualitative relation betwee.n the sentencesthat  are represented by our language as a directed arcor some such combination of arcs.In our ease, the network has two sub-networks.
Onerepresents the user's knowledge be.fore the dialog ses-sion, which is used to guess the user's model fronl herutterances .
The sentences assigne<l to the nodes inthis part have either the label PRE  or TOLD.
Wecall this subnetwork the prior part.
The other sulmet-work in which the nodes have either the label POSToi' TELL  is used to deal wil;h tit(', influence of the sys-tem's utterances.
This sulmetwork we call the poste-rior part.
It is important ;o make a clear distinction.Considering that the system explains a concept, it isnot proper to assume that the user knows some otherrelated concepts.
For example, if tile user utters thatshe knows some location x then it can be inferred thatshe also knows locations that  are (:los(; to x.
But thatis not true if the location x is explained by the system.The relations ill the prior part of the network arecategorized into four types as follows:(1) tl,e relations between objects in an expertise field(2) the relations between attr ibutes of obje(:ts(3) the relations lmtween an ol)je<-t and its attr ibutes(4) the relations betwee.n an att,' ibute of an objectand the evi<lence that the user knows itThe relations (1) are (:oncerL,ed with the expertisefiehl.
The objects ill the same expertise field are re-lated through the expertise field node.
We introducethe arcs that go from the expertise tMd no<le to the ob-je<:t nodes belonging to that fiel(1.
For example, ares goDora the node of "records collector" to that of "Com-pact Disk","Tower Records" (name of a record store)and so on.
The level of expertise can be controlledby the conditi<mal probal)ilities assigned to the objectnodes conditioned by tile ext)ertise tMd node.
In thisframework, we can intro<hLce arbitrary numbers of ex-pertise fiekls, all of which can be assigned the level ofexpertise.
'\]/he re.lations (2) are conce.rned with the <lolnainknowledge.
In our domain, those are the relations be-tween the locations, whi<:h are based on the assump-tion that  the user l)robably knows the locations closeto the location she known.
TILe relations are assunn.
'dto be symmetric.
A single directe<l arc of Bayesiannetworks does not represent a symmetric relation.
InordeL' to rel)resent a symmetric relation, we introduce adummy evi(tence node, whereby two arcs go forth fromthe two location nodes as shown in figure 1.
