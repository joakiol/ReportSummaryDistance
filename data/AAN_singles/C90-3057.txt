A bottleneck of all produetional-orientedmachine translation systems is to handlethose words which are not included intomain dictionaries of the particular system.In this paper we want to describe onepossible approach to this problem, based onthe idea of the so-called transduetlonaldictionary.
The first part of the paper isdevoted to the results of our empiricalinquiry into the problem in closely relatedlanguages, the second one to the descriptionof the implementatio" of the transducingdictionary in the Czech-to-Russian machinetranslation system RUSLAN (Hajji, 1987).1.1.
The basic idea of the transducing dic-tionary, originally developed by Z.Kirschnerfor the Engllsh-to-Czech NT system APAC(Kirschner, !987, l{ajiSov6 and ~irsehner,1987), is quite simple.
Among the wordswhich failed to be found in the basic dic-tionaries of the system, are some specialsets of words, which are very similar inboth languages.
The goal of the transducingdictionary is to translate those words pro-perly according to the rules, dealing withregularit ies between source and target shapeof them.
This way of handling lexicon as anopen system differs substantically from thetraditional one.
It is very useful especia\]-ly in the translation of the scientific ortechnical texts where many internationalwords are used.The transducing dictionary (TD), origi-nally used for ~T between English and Czechlanguages, handled mostly international(Greek-Latin) words.
We have assumed thatthere will be a greater number of lexico-derivational parallels between two closelyrelated languages and that they will contri-bute to a successful analysis to a greaterextent.
This assumption turned to be false.1.2.
Let us now turn to some issues of acontrastive analysis of Czech and Russian toinvestigate, where the idea of TD could beapplied for the translation between thesetwo languages.For instance, the Czech ending -ace istranslated as -acija, as in modlfikace -modlf ikaeija "modification" etc.
; thus, e.g.if the Cz.
word "emulace" is not found inthe main dictionary, it is translated by thetransducing rule as "emulaeiJa".
A wordtranslated in this algorithmic way may besubdued to the procedure of orthographicchanges and modif ications, in which somerules of Cz.-R. alternation of graphemes areapplied, as, e.g., ~--~e, h--~g, y~i  , x-~ks,au-~av, ou-~u, the initial e-~e, etc.It goes without saying that such atransduction is accompanied by a risk ofcreating errors or is impossible, e.g., incase that the output language lacks such adirect derivational variant.
However, evenin such cases it is possible to apply a longwith the transducing dictionary further"emergency rules" and to determine, on thebasis of the final segment of the wor~, atleast the type of the word and its grammati-cal characteristics, and thus to prevent thetermination of the analysis of the wholesentence due to a single non--identifiedword.
Of course, every irregular lexicalcorrespondence can be included in the maindictionary.1.3.
The rules of TD, as indicated above,can be used with several degrees of comp\]e--xity: from the possibil ity to translate"mechanically" without any changes or onlywith some orthographic modif ications as inelektroskop - elektroskop - "electroscope",through the necessity of certain modif ica-tions of the word-formative segment or en-ding according to the needs of the targetlanguage as in algoritmus - algoritm"algorithm" to the l imitation to a mereidentif ication of the word as for its wordclass, or, as the case may be, its morpholo-gical or semantic characteristics as, e.g.,with tla~Itko - knopka "push-button", wherethe ending segment -tko points to the noun,neuter, ~enoting an instrument (means).314Accord ing  to these degrees,  the set ofder ivat iona l  morphemes product ive for thedomain of computer  techniques can be c lass i -fied into several groups; not always we are,of course,  concerned with a suffix in astr ict ly  l inguist ic  spec i f icat ion of theterm; rather ,  we deal with a segment whichhas for the given pair of  languages therequired propert ies  (it may consist  of twosuff ixes or their  parts,  as, e.g.
,  in -kce,-uee, and also of an or iginal  word stem, asgram; we quote here segments in the form ofnominat ive  sing.,  i.e.
together  with theinf lect ional  ending).1.3.1.
The most substant ia l  part of thef irst group consists  in words denot ing thenames of mach ines ,  devices and instruments ,and also some names of agents of events,  ofsome propert ies  and processes.
These wordscan be t rans lated to Russian by a meret ranscr ipt ion.
The fo l lowing suff ixes aremembers of this group:-skop, -metr,  -tot,  -graf ,  - tron,  -fen, -at,- log, ~ant, -ent,  -tufa, ~ika.I.\[~.2.
The next group contains nouns andadject ives the form of which must he modi -f ied accord ing to models customary in thetarget language,  which involves some minorchanges in the der lvat ional  segment or en-ding.
The respect ive suff ixes are:-smus/ -zm,  -ace/ -ac i Ja  , -kce/--kclja , -use/-uel Ja,  -ance/ -anoi Ja,  -ence/ -enei Ja ,  - ie/- i J~, -gram/-gzamma,  -aze / -az is , -~eze/ -ez ls ,-Ita/-ost', - ium/- l J ,  - ista/- ist .Certa in regular i t ies  of t rans lat ion ofder ivat lonal  suf f ixes carl be observed alsowlth ad ject ives ,  which form an importantpart of termino logy,  of.
the fo l lowingcorrespondence:~Ick@/- i~eski J  , -~rn~/-arnyj  , -~ln~/-a~nyJ  ,-antn l / -antny j ,  -entn~/-entny j ,  -~nl/-c lonnyJ ,  - ivn~/-~vnyJ .1.3.~.
The third group includes semant ica l lyuni form and product ive classes of words,  as,e.g.
,  deverbat ive  nouns ending with -ani~-end, which denote in Czech a process or itsresult  (kodov~n~ - encoding,  spou~t~n~ -switch ing on ), nouns in -ost denot ing aproperty  (pra~nost - dust innes,  v lhkost  -humid i ty ) ,  nouns in -tel denot ing an animateor inanimate actor (odh~ratel  - consumer,ukazatel  - marker)  and also nouns in -~t~with the meaning of a certain ~lace or space(nalezi~t~ - deposi t ,  praeovi~%~ - work ingplace) and nouns in -tvl with the meaning ofa feature,  workshop or property (mno~stvl  -a number of, pekagstv~ - bakery,  bohatstv~ --r ichness).
All these word- format ive  typeshave a corresponding equivalence in Russ ian,with minor  modi f icat ions.
However,  in thecourse of the long-term development ,  thesemantic shifts of the word basis preventthe poss ib i l i ty  of the t rans lat ion of thesetypes only by means of the word- format ioncorrespondence of the t ransducing dictlona--ry.
TD cannot do here more than specify theword class or the gender.
These data can beused in the syntactic analysis of the sourcelanguage but in the D. output the word hasto be marked as not boeing found in thedict ionary.I.~.4.
There is one more group of words weencounter  in technical  texts which is pro-ductlve in Czech and has a clearly specif iedmeaning.
There belong the nouns in -6 (-i~, -a~, -e~): chladi~ - cooler; these nounsdenote first of all a device or instrument,sometimes also an animate actor.
The suff ixhas no word formation paral lel  in R. and issubst i tuted by other suff ixes,  or f requent lyby a complex naming unit: p~eklada~ -t rans l Jator  "translator"  or ptep~na~ - pere-k l ju~ate~ "switch".
A s imilar s i tuat ion oc-curs with the suff ixes -~tko, -~tko, -dlo,-~rna, -ovna.
Also there suff ixes have nocorresponding equivalent in P.In spite of the fact that ~n thisgroup, the der ivat lonal  means determineclasses charaeter ist lc  both as for theirmeaning and form, this fact is made use ofonl; part ia l ly  - the transducing deviceeasi ly  and correct ly  identi f ies their  wordclass and can asslgn to them morphological  ,or as the case may be, semantic character i -stic.3.1.
The implementat ion of the t rans~uclnKd ict ionary was to a great extent inf luencedby the programming language used, namely thesystems Q (Colmeraurer ,  without date) inwhich the whole system RUSLM~ is written.Systems Q provide means for working withgrammar d i rect ly  in the form of rewr i t ingrules,  which are real ized by means of alabel led graph; the use of a rule meansadding a new edge.
In order to l imit thenumber of rules,  the programme (i.e.
the setof rewr i t ing rules) is div ided into phases.At the end of each phase , the redundantedges are removed.
The whole system HUSLANconsists of 16 phases.The TD does not immediate ly  fol low themain d ict ionary (i.e.
the d ic t ionary  of2315stems) because the mechanism of morphologi-cal analysis cannot distinguish at thatpoint, which words have been found in thedictionary and which have not.
This is dueto the fact that the identif ication is givenby non-empty intersection of the pattern ofthe stem and the patterns that come intoconsideration as the patterns of the ending;this intersection is identified by the phaseimmediately following the dictionary look-up.
In the next phase, a preliminary syntac-tic analysis is carried out, in the courseof which the unambiguous words found in thedictionary and immediately depending on eachother are put together.
At this point, therules of the TD are applied.The forms which have not been found inthe main dictionary pass through the phasesunchanged.
In the first phase of the TD twokinds of rules are applied - the first onedealing with the groups from 1.3.1. and1.3.2.
and the second one with the rest(I.3.3.
and 1.3.4.).
The only differenceamong those two types of rewriting rules isthat the second one does not transcribe theCz.
lexical value of the word into the R.Both add morphological characteristics andse,~antical features to  particular endings.The first phase of %he TD contains alsothe first portion of rules rewriting theresult of the application of the above men-tioned rules (of the first type ).
Thefollowing transcriptions are carried out :hi->i, x-~ks, hey (at the beginning of theword) -~ev, ou~u,  hy-~gi , all long vowelsare changed to short, 9~r ,  ~e ,  d~d6,t'~t6, n-~n6 ( 6 is a code for the R. softmarker) , gy-Pgi , ky~k i .
In this way, theoriginal Czech stems (to which the ~.
en~dings are attached at this point) are trans-cribed into the corresponding R. forms.The second phase of TD is added inRUSLAN to the phase of Czech analysis inwhich the disintegrated stems are puttogether again.
This phase of TD has twomain tasks:(a) to finish the transcription of the Czechstems Into the Russian ones, which for tech-nical reasons could not be done in the pre-ceding phase,(b) to modify the form of representation insuch a way as to be consistent with thewords that have been found in thedictionary; the rules remove the auxil iarysymbols and put together disintegrated ~us-sian lexieal unit.The third phase of TD processes a rat-her small set of words which have not beenfound in the main dictionary and for whichnone of the rules of the preceding phases ofTD can be applied.
This unrecognized wordsare great obstacle for the build-up of thedependency tree because they do not allowthe parts that stand to their left and totheir right to be put together in the courseof the syntactico-semantic analysis.
As atemporary solution of this problem, thorules of this phase rewrite all hithertounidentif ied words as nouns in neuter sing.For a more reliable solution, the work is inprogress to distinguish between the endingsin a more subtle way (e.g.
those forms en-ding in -~ should be assigned the word classof adverbs, etc.).
The default procedure ofthe third phase of TD arrives at a dead endin case the unidentified word is a verb,since then the sentence lacks its key ele-ment - the root of the tree.It is evident that none of the g~lidinglines applied in the TS in its present formis 100% valid.
However, it has a great valuefor the experlmental test ing of the systembecause it filters out words that have to beadded to the dictionaries of the system.~FER~CESColmerauer A.: "Les systemes Q ou un forma-lisme Dour analyser et synthetiser desphrases sur ordinateur".
