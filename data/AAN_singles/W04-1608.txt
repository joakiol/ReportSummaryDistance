Arabic Script-based Languages deserve to be studied linguisticallyMartin KayStanford UniversityArabic script-based languages are attracting increased attention for reasons that areregrettably far from their intrinsic linguistic interest.
At the same time, statistical andcorpus-based approaches to language processing are acquiring such dominance that it isbecoming difficult for the advocates of other methods even to receive a hearing.
I willargue that this is an alarming trend against which computational linguists, and especiallythose studying these languages, should resist with great determination.
My argument forthis position rests on the following observations:1.
Unless the role of quantum mechanics and chaos in the workings of ordinarylanguage has been grossly underestimated, nothing about the subject isprobabilistic in any fundamental sense.2.
The statistics are a surrogate for knowledge of the world and artificial intelligenceand the performance of any system based on an approach that reduces this tonumerical annotations on linguistic structures can only hope to reach a very lowasymptote.3.
Thanks to Zipf?s law, corpus annotation is subject to a severe law of diminishingreturns to which the linguist?s search for significant generalizations is not subject.4.
To the various levels of linguistic analysis and to the indefinite range of subjectsand propositions that texts may treat, there correspond different notions oflocality, each requiring its own statistical models.5.
Most importantly, most of the linguistic properties that must be considered fortext processing are not emergent properties of the texts at all but crucially dependon l?arbitraire du signe, the arbitrary relation between a symbol and what itsymbolizes.
