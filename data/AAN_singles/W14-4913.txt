{narayan.c, parth.p, pinal.p, vishal.p}@ezdi.usAbstract[We report of the procedures of developing a large representative corpus of 50,000 sentencestaken from clinical notes.
Previous reports of annotated corpus of clinical notes have beensmall and they do not represent the whole domain of clinical notes.
The sentences included inthis corpus have been selected from a very large raw corpus of ten thousand documents.
Theseten thousand documents are sampled from an internal repository of more than 700,000 docu-ments taken from multiple health care providers.
Each of the documents is de-identified to re-move any PHI data.
Using the Penn Treebank tagging guidelines with a bit of modifications,we annotate this corpus manually with an average inter-annotator agreement of more than98%.
The goal is to create a parts of speech annotated corpus in the clinical domain that iscomparable to the Penn Treebank and also represents the totality of the contemporary text asused in the clinical domain.
We also report the output of the TnT tagger trained on the initial21,000 annotated sentences reaching a preliminary accuracy of above 96%.
]1 IntroductionAutomated parts of speech (PoS) annotation have been an active field of research for more than 40years now.
Obviously, there are quite a few of tools already available with an impressive accuracy re-turns (Toutanova et al, 2003; Shen et al.
, 2007; Spoustov?a et al., 2009; S?gaard, 2010).
This is true inthe general domain text such as news reports or general domain articles.
But when it comes to a nichearea like clinical domain, no automated parts of speech taggers are readily available nor has there beenany report of any such large corpus developed that meet the standards as set out in the general domain.Interest has grown now as NLP is sought after in the clinical domain, particularly for the task of in-formation extraction from clinical notes.There have been previous attempts for creating PoS annotated corpus in the clinical domain (Tateisiet al., 2004; Pakhomov et al, 2006; Albright et al., 2013).
All of these corpora are relatively small andthe PoS taggers trained on them have not been shown to reach above 96% in the clinical domain.
At-tempts at adapting a general domain PoS tagger to work better for clinical domain include Easy Adapt(Daum?
H., 2007) and ClinAdapt (Ferraro et al., 2013).
But none of these two adaptation methods en-hance the accuracy levels to more than 95%.Given that the text in clinical notes is radically different from what appears in the general domain,the general domain English PoS tagger models do not perform well on the clinical text.
Our experi-ments with three such general domain taggers, namely Charniak (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), Stan-ford (Klein and Manning, 2003) and OpenNLP, yielded not more than 95% accuracy.
This motivatedus to take a radical step of developing a fresh parts of speech annotated corpus comparable to the PennTreebank.
Well, we are aware that it is going to take a lot of money, time and effort.
But we also be-lieve that it is necessary if we need better NLP tools for this domain.2 The Representative CorpusTo ensure that we have a representative corpus, we sampled a corpus of more than 750,000 documentsfrom 119 providers (hospitals and specialty clinics).
The biggest challenge was to take a representativesample of documents from various specialties and different work types.
Thanks to the metadata infor-mation available in our internal repository, this was solved in a rather easier way although we did needto look for information on classification and sub-classification of the domain manually.872.1 Sampling TaskOut of these 750,000 documents, we selected only ten hospitals for document sampling as they werelarge providers with a greater number of note count and provided a diversity of the specialty doc-tors/providers dictating the clinical notes.
These ten hospitals amounted to a total of 237,110 docu-ments written by 508 doctors of roughly 97 clinical specialties.
A summary of this is given in Appen-dix A.2.2 Sentence ClusteringWe have used 237,110 documents for the process of selecting the sample sentences undergoing thePoS annotation.
All of these documents were classified into different categories based on their worktypes (operative notes, admission notes, discharge summaries etc.
), service line (cardiology, oncology,medicine, ambulatory etc.
), section headers (History of Present Illness, Chief Complaints, PhysicalExamination, Laboratory Data etc.).
Based on this classification, we have selected a sample of 10,000documents fairly representing the 237,110 documents selected in the first phase.These 10,000 documents were parsed using the Charniak?s full syntactic parser (Charniak & John-son, 2005).
After some modifications, the Charniak parser on clinical data gives an accuracy of about95% at the PoS level.
A graph based string similarity algorithm was used to find similar sentencesfrom these 10,000 documents.
A summary of what it yielded is as follows:Total Number of Sentences: 704,271Total Number of Unique Sentences:  365,518Total Number of Unique Patterns:  234,909The unique patterns were clustered together using a hierarchical clustering algorithm.
Patterns weregrouped together by calculating the Euclidean distance with a threshold similarity of 80 or more.
Fol-lowing this method, we got a total of 3,768 patterns that represented all of the unique patterns.
We callthem pattern heads.By giving a proportional weightage to each of these pattern heads as per their occurrence in theunique patterns, we derived a total of 56,632 sentences.
While no two sentences selected are same,about 41% of the patterns in the sample corpus have a frequency of more than 1.Appendix B shows example pairs of sentences having the same tag pattern and Appendix C showsexample pairs of sentences having similar pattern.The final selected candidate sentences also contained quite a  few junk sentences (which came ofcourse from the clinical notes themselves) or some very frequent smaller patterns (e.g.
date patterns),we manually removed them to get a total of 49,278 sentences with a total word count of 491,690 andan average per sentence word count of 9.97.
The greatest number of token for a sentence was found tobe 221 in the sampled corpus (while the same in the original, actual corpus is 395).3 Annotation MethodAs against the common practice of semi-automatic method of annotating text, we purposely chose toannotate the text from scratch.
It has been reported that tools do affect the decisions of the annotators(Marcus et al., 1993).
We asked the annotators to use simple notepad and for each of the tokens theyhad to key in the appropriate PoS label.
Tokenization and sentence boundary detection were automati-cally done before it went to the annotators.As against the common practice of engaging annotators with a medical background and trainingthem into linguistic annotation (Pakhomov et al., 2006; Fan et al.
, 2011), we purposely chose to en-gage linguists and train them into medical language.
The annotators were all graduate level researchersin linguistics and had a deep knowledge of theoretical syntax.
As next step in linguistics analysis afterPoS tagging is syntactic parsing or chunking, the linguists were also motivated to learn about the goalsof this task i.e.
we informed them about our interests in developing a chunker and a parser afterwards.This information helps the annotators to think in terms of making syntactic tree while assigning a PoStag.
For example, there is always confusion among the tag pairs IN/RP, VBN/JJ and so on.
But if onecan try drawing a syntactic tree, the confusion gets cleared.
While training annotators with medicalbackground in linguistics for the task of PoS tagging may seem rather easy, the same cannot be saidfor syntactic tree formation.
Besides, the linguists always had the choice of consulting medical experts88(medical coders, medical transcriptionists with more than 5 years of experience) in case any phrasehad to be explained in terms of its meaning.Training sessions were held for linguists for first 15 days during which differences were brought tofore and a consensus was reached.
This period was strictly for training purposes and text annotatedduring this period was validated more than thrice before getting included in the final corpus.
After thistraining period, an inter-annotator agreement round was run with 10,000 sentences distributed to fourannotators in turn.
Each file was annotated by at least two annotators.
The differences were then com-pared and arbitrated by a third annotator who discussed the conflicting cases with the initial annotatorsand brought a consensus among them.Inter-annotator agreement at the start of this phase was 93% to 95%.
This after a month increased toa consistent 97% to 100%.
We are at the end of this phase and the accuracy is consistently close to99%.
Also of note is the fact that apart from the initial 5 days of face-to-face training session, the an-notators never sit together and they work remotely from the convenience of their location and have aflexible time.
We also ensured that they do not work long hours at a stretch doing this job as we knowthat this is a tedious job and cannot be done in a hurry.
For a full-time annotator, the target goal wasannotation of 1600 word per day (8 hours) and for the part-time annotators, it was half of that.
Theywere always encouraged to come up with any issues for a weekly discussion on the conflicting or con-fusing cases.For the later phases of annotation process, it is ensured that each annotation is validated by at leastone other annotator.
If disagreements arise, arbitration is done by involving a third annotator followinga discussion.As the text might contain tokenization errors, sentence boundary detection errors and other gram-matical or typographical mistakes, the annotators are asked to document them in a separate spread-sheet.
The sentences themselves are sacrosanct to the annotators and they can at the most makechanges in separating the hyphenated words if they are not properly hyphenated by the tokenizer anddocument this change.4 Annotation GuidelineBarring a couple of new tags, the annotation guideline largely follows the Penn Treebank PoS annota-tion guidelines (Santorini, B., 1990) and takes inputs from various other guidelines such as the PennTreebank II parsing guidelines (Bies et al., 1995) and MiPACQ guidelines (Warner et al., 2012).
Anew tag that we have added on top of the Penn tagset looks for marking a difference between the ex-pletive ?it?
and the pronominal ?it?
as it helps in tasks like anaphora resolution.
The new tag for theexpletive use of ?it?
is given as ?EXP?.
The tagset contains a total of 41 tags.
The other four tags areHYPH, AFX, GW and XX.
These tags are well described in the MiPACQ guideline.As we have also seen the PoS labels given to the Penn Treebank data, we find that we are differingin assigning the tag to some of the words.
For example, for the temporal expressions like ?today?,?yesterday?
and ?tomorrow?, the tag in Penn corpus is invariably NN while we make a difference intheir adverbial use and nominal use and assign the tag accordingly as ?RB?
or ?NN?.5 Initial Training ResultsAfter 4 months of annotation, we achieved a total of 21 thousand sentences annotated.
For an experi-mental run, we trained a tagger to test how far we can go with this data.
We implemented a modifiedversion of the TnT (Trigram and Tag) (Brants, 2000) algorithm to train a PoS tagger.
This tagger wasgiven an input of 17,586 sentences containing a total of 158,330 words and was tested against 3,924sentences containing a total of 38,143 words.Without giving any extra features apart from the ones mentioned in Brants, we got a total of 2,621sentences and 36,234 words annotated correctly.
That is the TnT out-of-the-box accuracy was 95.00%as against the Charniak out-of-the-box accuracy of 91.36%.We also compared the same test data against the Charniak parser (without the resource of tag dic-tionary and the rules).
We find that the current tagger was actually performing better.
Results im-proved by 0.33% if we modified the algorithm to handle unknown words using suffixes from themedical domain.
These suffixes were collected specifically from the medical domain and were suchfor which a single tag could be given.89We also experimented with another method for improvements.
This included using a dictionary ofunambiguous words (words having single tags invariably, for adjectives and verbs only) and resettingthe emission probability to 1 for them.
These two improvement techniques combined enhanced theresults by 1.24% to push the accuracy to 96.24%.Given that a fraction of our corpus is giving us 95% accuracy which is at par with or better than re-ported anywhere else for PoS tagging task in the domain of clinical NLP, we believe that the resultsshould only improve once we increase the training data and apply the improvement techniques avail-able in the book.6 ConclusionThere is a paucity of good and large enough annotated corpus in the domain of clinical NLP.
The ex-isting corpora are small although extensive analysis has been done on them.
Our effort through thisproject is to fill the gap of having a large corpus comparable to the Penn Treebank.In this paper we described an ongoing effort to create a sample corpus of clinical notes across mostof the sub-domains and including all the different types of linguistic styles in this domain.
We havealso used a novel method for creation of a representative corpus which can be said to represent thewhole of the clinical text in current practice across providers within United States.As compared to semi-automated methods of annotation practiced even in big corpus like the PennTreebank, we are following a fully manual process of annotation where the annotators are only givencontextual information and no other help or props are provided apart from the guidelines to fasten theannotation process.
We obtain an inter-annotator agreement of 98.93 and we believe that this is thebest approach to go for this task.Using the basic TnT algorithm we also train a tagger using 30% of our data (17,500 sentences) an-notated in the initial 3 months of the project and achieve a baseline accuracy of 95%.
We expect thatour accuracy should improve to more than 98% once we train the same algorithm on all the 50,000annotated sentences.After the completion of the project, we may release this corpus for research use.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the contribution of the linguists at JNU, New Delhi namely, Oinam Nganthoibi,Gayetri Thakur, Shiladitya Bhattacharya and Srishti Singh.
