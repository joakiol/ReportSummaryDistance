PRESUPPOSITION AND IMPLICATURE IN MODEL-THEORETIC PRAGMATICSDouglas B. MoranOregon State UniversityModel-theoretic pragmatics is an attempt to provide aformal description of the pragmatics of natural languageas effects arising from using model-theoretic semanticsin a dynamic environment.
The pragmatic phenomenaconsidered here have been variously labeled~resupposition \[I\] and eonven?ional implicature \[6\].The models used in traditional model-theoretic semanticsprovide a complete and static representation of knowledgeabout the world, llowever, this is not the environmentin which language is used.
Language is used in adynamic environment - the participants have incompleteknowledge of the world and the understanding of asentence can add to the knowledge of the listener.
Aformalism which allows models to contain incompleteknowledge and to which knowledge can be added has beendeveloped \[2, 3, 12\].In model-theoretic semantics, the relationships betweenwords is not inherent in the structure of the model.These relationships between words are given by logicalformulas, called meaning postulazes.
In traditionalmodel-theoretic semantics (with static models), thesemeaning postulates can be evaluated when the model ischosen to insure that it is a Peasonable model for thelanguage.
In dynamic model-theoretic semantics, theserelationships must be verified as information is addedto the model to insure that the new information does notviolate any of these relationships.
This verificationprocess may cause the addition of more information tothe model.The processing of the formula representing a sentenceadds to the dynamic model the information given as theassertion of the sentence - the pr~maz~j information ofthe sentence - if it is not already in the model.
Theaddition of this primary information can cause - throughthe verification of a meaning postulate - the additionof 8econ~x~ information.
This secondary informationis not part of the assertion 0?
the sentence, but isneeded in the processing of the assertion.
Thischaracterization of secondary information is very similarto the classical definition of presupposition \[I\].This approach displays different behavior for the threedifferent cases of information contained in the model.In the first case, neither the assertion nor the pre-suppositions and implicatures are known.
The attemptto add the assertion activates the verification of themeaning postulates giving the presuppositions andimplicatures, thus causing that secondary information tobe added to the model as a prerequisite to the additionof the primary information.
In the second case, thepresuppositions and implicatures are known (either trueor false) and the assertion is unknown.
The attempt toadd the primary information again activates theverification of the meaning postulates.
However, inthis case, the presuppositions and implicatures aresimply being checked - the verification process is notinterrupted to  add this secondary information to themodel.
This case corresponds to what Grice and othershave termed to be a well-structured conversation.
Inthe third case, the assertion of the sentence is knownto be true or false.
Since no new information needs tobe added to the model to process the semantic represen-tation of the sentence, the verification of meaningpostulates is not activated.
The presuppositions andimplicatures need not be verified because they had tohave been verified before the assertion of the sentenceor its negation could have been entered into the model.The presuppositions and implicatures of subordinateclauses do not necessarily become presuppositions andimplicatures of the whole sentence.
The problem ofwhen and how such presuppositions become those of thematrix sentence is known as the pPoSeotion problem \[13\].The system described here provides a simple and motivatedsolution to the projection problem.
The models used inthis system are partial models; a clause which has apresupposition or implicature which is not true has anundefinable denotation.
An intensional logic \[ii\] isused to  provide the  semantic representations of sentencesand the intensionality establishes transparent and opaquecontexts (hoLg8 and plug8 \[7\]) which determine whether ornot an undefinable va lue  indicating the failure of apresupposition for a subordinate clause can propagateand fo rce  the  matr ix  sentence  to  have  an undef inab levalue.
In the case where the presuppositions andimplicatures are  pro jec ted  up from the  subord inate  clauseto the matrix sentence, undefinable values are allowed topropagate, and thus a failure of a projected pre-supposition or implicature affects not only the sub-ordinate clause in which it originates, but also thematrix sentence.The determination of the projection characteristics isclaimed to be an integral part of the meanings of wordsand not a separab le  feature .There  are  two other  major  a t tempts  to  hand le  pre -suppos i t ions  and impl i ca tures  in  a mode l - theoret i cf ramework .

Gazdar  \ [4 ,  S\]accumulates sets of propositions, cancelling out thosewhich are  incompatible.
Moran \[12\] compares theapproach  taken  here  to  that  o f  Kar t tunen and Peters  andshows how this approach is simpler and better motivated.Gazdar's system is broader, but this approach is shownto correctly handle sentences which are incorrectlyhandled by Gazdar, and ways are suggested to  expand thecoverage of this system.REFERENCES\[I\] G.
