Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation (HyTra) @ EACL 2014, page 97,Gothenburg, Sweden, April 27, 2014. c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsHybrid Strategies for better products and  shorter time-to-marketKurt EberleLingenio GmbHKarlsruher Stra?e 1069126 HeidelbergGermanyk.eberle@lingenio.deAbstractThe main Lingenio MT products are based on rule-based architectures.
In the presentation we showhow knowledge from corpora is integrated into the systems using the language analysis- andtranslation-components in a bootstrapping approach.
This relates to the bilingual dictionaries, butalso to learning decisions concerning the selection of syntactic rules and semantic readings inparsing and semantic evaluation.
These strategies contribute both to improve the quality of thesystems and to shorten go-to-market of new products significantly.
Also a number of attractive spin-off functions can be generated from them which, in addition, can be used for designing new typesof products and as preparatory and postediting features in MT systems whose core is of type SMT.97
