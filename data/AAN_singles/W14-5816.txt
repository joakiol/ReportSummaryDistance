and ?be?
(Hindikar and ho respectively).
Light verb constructions are a challenge for computational grammarsbecause they are a highly productive predicational strategy in Hindi.
Such nominals have beendiscussed in the literature (Mohanan, 1997; Ahmed and Butt, 2011; Bhatt et al., 2013), but thiswork is a first attempt at a Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) representation.
We look at threepossibilities for the design of elementary trees in TAG and explore one option in depth usingHindi data.
In this analysis, the nominal is represented with all the arguments of the light verbconstruction, while the light verb adjoins into its elementary tree.1 IntroductionLexical resource development for computational analyses in Hindi must contend with a large number oflight verb constructions.
For instance, in the Hindi Treebank (Palmer et al., 2009), nearly 37% of thepredicates have been annotated as light verb constructions.
Hence, the combination of a noun with a lightverb is a productive predicational strategy in Hindi.
For example, the noun yaad ?memory?
combineswith kar ?do?
to form yaad kar ?remember?.In light verb constructions, the noun is a predicating element along with the light verb.
The pres-ence of two predicating elements representing a single meaning is a challenge for a linguistic theorythat maps between syntax and semantics.
Consequently, the argument structure representation for lightverb constructions (LVC) has resulted in two opposing views in syntactic theory.
One view supportsa noun-centric analysis of the LVC, where the noun is represented with all the arguments of the LVCe.g.
(Grimshaw and Mester, 1988; Kearns, 1988).
The light verb?s only role is to theta-mark the ar-guments of the LVC, without any semantic contribution.
The second view proposes argument sharingbetween the noun and the light verb as they both contribute to the argument structure of the LVC (Butt,1995; Ahmed et al., 2012).
We refer to such analyses as verb-centric analyses.Within the framework of this debate, we propose to use Lexicalized Feature-based Tree AdjoiningGrammar, which is a variant of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG).
TAG has been used to represent lightverb constructions in French (Abeill?e, 1988) and Korean (Han and Rambow, 2000).
The primitive struc-tures of TAG are its elementary trees, which encapsulate the syntactic and semantic arguments of itslexical anchor (for a light verb construction, the noun and light verb respectively will be the anchors).The association of a structural object with a linguistic anchor allows TAG to specify all the linguisticconstraints associated with the anchor over a local domain.
This is especially advantageous for compos-ing the complex argument structure of a LVC.
In comparison with other formalisms (e.g.
context-freegrammars), this property gives TAG an extended domain of locality.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

and ?be?
(kar andho) as part of a light verb construction.
The same noun alternates with either light verb, resulting in achange in the argument structure of the verb.
For example the noun chorii ?theft?
can occur as either choriikar ?theft do?
or chorii ho ?theft happen?.
There are nearly 265 nouns showing this alternation in the HindiTreebank (Palmer et al., 2009)1.
These constitute about 15% of the total light verb constructions in theTreebank.
Note that other light verbs also occur in Hindi e.g.
de ?give?, le ?take?
etc.
but they are notpart of this study.Section 3 has some examples of these predicating nominals.
Before this, Section 2 will introduce theTAG formalism.
Section 4 describes the design of the elementary trees that are the basis of the analysisand in the final section we summarize our findings and make suggestions for future work.2 Lexicalized Feature based Tree Adjoining GrammarTree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) is a formal tree-rewriting system that is used to describe the syntax ofnatural languages (Joshi and Schabes, 1997).
The basic structure of a TAG grammar is an elementarytree, which is a fragment of a phrase structure tree labelled with both terminal and non-terminal nodes.The elementary trees are combined by the operations of substitution (where a terminal node is replacedwith a new tree) or adjunction (where an internal node is split to add a new tree).The elementary trees in TAG can be enriched with feature structures (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1988).These can capture linguistic descriptions in a more precise manner and also capture adjunction con-straints.
TAG with feature structures is also known as FTAG (Feature-structure based TAG).
A TAG canalso be lexicalized i.e., an elementary tree has a lexical item as one of its terminal nodes.
LexicalizedTAG enhanced with feature structures is known as Lexicalized Feature-based Tree-Adjoining Gram-mar (LF-TAG).
This has been used for developing computational grammars for English (XTAG-Group,2001), French (Abeill?e and Candito, 2000) and Korean (Han et al., 2000).
In our analysis, we will alsouse LF-TAG, but we will refer to it as LTAG for convenience.Figure 1 shows the basic steps for composing elementary trees containing feature structures.
Eachnode has a top and a bottom feature structure.
Features can be shared among nodes in an elementarytree.
In the tree for the verb running, the variable1is used to show that the verb must share the samefeatures as the subject NP.The tree for running is an initial tree with a single terminal for its argument noun phrase (NP).
Thetree for is, on the other hand, is a special type of elementary tree called the auxiliary tree.
It has a footnode (marked with an asterisk), which is identical to its root node.
The auxiliary tree will adjoin into thetree for running at the VP node only.
The top and bottom feature structures for MODE at the VP node,have different values (ind and ger), and they cannot unify.
This captures an adjunction constraint forobligatory adjunction and requires adjunction to take place at this node only.During adjunction, the top of the root of the auxiliary tree (for is) will unify with the top of theadjunction site.
The bottom of the foot of the auxiliary tree will unify with the bottom of the adjunctionsite.
During substitution, the top node in the tree for Jill unifies with the node at NP.This results in the second tree in Figure 1, post the operations of substitution and adjunction.
In afinal derivation step, top and bottom feature structures at each node will unify, to give the final derivedtree with a single feature structure at each node.
The resulting tree is called a derived tree, but anotherby-product of the TAG analysis is also the derivation tree.
This tree has numbered node labels that recordthe history of composition of the elementary trees.
For example, the tree for Jill is running can be seenin Figure 2.
The root of this tree is labelled with running, which is an initial tree of the type S.An important characteristic of lexicalized elementary trees is their correspondence with that lexi-cal item?s predicate-argument structure.
This has sometimes been formalized as the PACP (Predicate-Argument Co-occurrence Principle) (Frank, 2002).
The PACP restricts the structure of the elementarytrees such that they may not be drawn arbitrarily.
At the same time, lexicalized TAGs will often have the1It is possible that many more nouns occur in this group, but all their alternations are not instantiated in the Treebankcorpus.128SVP[AGR=1MODE=ind][MODE=ger]VrunningNP[AGR=1]NP[][AGR=[PERS=3 num=sg]]NJillVP[AGR=2MODE=3]VP*[MODE=ger]V[MODE=3ind][AGR=2[PERS=3 num=sg]]isAfter substitutionand adjunction:SVP[AGR=1MODE=ind][AGR=2MODE=3]VP[MODE=ger][MODE=ger]VrunningV[MODE=3ind][AGR=2[PERS=3 num=sg]]isNP[AGR=1][agr=[pers=3 num=sg]]JillAfter top-bottom unification:SVP[AGR=1[PERS=3 NUM=sg]MODE=ind]VP[MODE=ger]VrunningV[AGR=1MODE=ind]isNP[AGR=1]JillFigure 1: LTAG showing feature structures and constraints on adjunction (Example adapted from(Kallmeyer and Osswald, 2013))runningisJill1 2Figure 2: Derivation tree for ?Jill is running?.

For example a verb such as runwill anchor a different elementary tree for its passive or interrogative variant.3 DataIn this section, we introduce the nominal predicates that will be the focus of our LTAG analysis.
Suchnominals allow an agentive (ergative-marked2) subject with the light verb kar ?do?.
In contrast, the samenominal does not have an agentive subject with ho ?be?
(Ahmed and Butt, 2011).
The alternation withho ?be?
has an intransitivizing effect.
In (1) and (2), a change in the light verb results in the presence orabsence of the agent argument.
The nominal chorii is the same, but the LVC in (1) requires only a Themeargument, whereas (2) needs an Agent and a Theme.
(1) gehenejewels.Mchoriitheft.Fhue.be.Perf.MPl?The jewels got stolen?
(2) Ram-neRam-Erggehenejewels.M.Plchoriitheft.Fkiye.do.Perf.M.Pl?Ram stole the jewels ?In English, a similar alternation structure may be found with light verbs in bring to light vs. come tolight (Claridge, 2000).
Here, two light verbs bring and come are used to express either a causative orinchoative reading.
In the Hindi examples, the light verb ho ?be?
and the light verb kar ?do?
are used toexpress the inchoative vs. causative reading.
In Persian, kardan ?make or do?
and ?sodan ?become?
areused in a manner similar (although not identical) to Hindi.The noun chorii ?theft?
belongs to a particular class of nouns where a change in the light verb doesresult in a change in the arguments, but the agent argument is always presupposed, irrespective of thelight verb.
For instance, the addition of a phrase such as apne-aap ?on its own?
is semantically odd withexample 1.
This is because the event of ?theft?
cannot occur without an agent, although it is unexpressedwith the light verb ho ?be?.
Contrast this with 4, where apne-aap is not odd and where the alternationwith kar ?do?
is not possible.
The non-alternating noun afsos ?regret?
occurs with an Experiencer subject,which can act spontaneously and hence allows the use of apne-aap.

In reference to the examples above, this would imply thatthe light verb chorii ?theft?
would be represented by two trees?
i.e., it would appear with two argumentswith kar ?do?
and only one with ho ?be?.The second option is a verb-centric analysis, where the light verb kar ?do?
would contribute the agen-tive argument, and chorii would contribute the object.
The nominal?s elementary tree would consist ofonly one argument, regardless of whether it combined with kar ?do?
or ho ?be?.
The third option is to2Hindi is a split-ergative language, where ergative case on the subject is found only with transitive verbs in the perfectiveaspect.
For non-perfective aspect, the subject is nominative.130represent the LVC chorii kar ?theft do; steal?
as the anchor of a single elementary tree?
a single multi-word expression.
While the first two options are worth exploring, we discard the third option for tworeasons: first, the LVC is highly productive in Hindi, which would imply that this would result in toomany elementary trees in the grammar.
Second, there is evidence that the LVC forms a phrasal categoryin the syntax (Mohanan, 1997; Davison, 2005).
This means that individual components of the LVC maybe moved away from each other, emphatic particles or negation may intervene and the noun componentmay be independently modified by an adjective.
Therefore, the multi-word option would not be the bestapproach here.
This is in contrast to previous TAG analyses for English LVCs where both nominal andverb are anchored in the same elementary tree (XTAG-Group, 2001).Figure 3 shows the derivation trees (cf.
Figure 2) for the three different analysis options as describedabove for the sentence Ram ne gehene chorii kiye ?Ram stole the jewels?.
The LVC in question is choriikar ?theft do?.
The dashed line indicates adjunction into the elementary tree, whereas the solid lineindicates substitution.
In the noun-centric analysis, the light verb adjoins into the nominal?s elementarytree and contributes no arguments of its own.
For the verb-centric analysis, the light verb contributes theargument Ram, whereas the nominal contributes jewels.
Finally, for the multi-word expression tree, theftand do are both anchors of the elementary tree.Noun-centric analysis ?choriiRam-negehenekiyeVerb-centric analysis ?

chorii-kiyeRam-negeheneFigure 3: Derivation graphs showing three options for the analysis of Ram ne gehene chorii kiye ?Ramstole the jewels?.
The LVC is chorii kiye.In this paper we explore a noun-centric analysis of Hindi LVCs.3In the analysis that follows, we willdescribe two elementary trees for a noun like chorii i.e., when it combines with either ho ?be?
or kar ?do?.Making the elementary structures richer and more complex increases ambiguity locally and we then havemore descriptions for the same lexical item.
But these structures also capture local dependencies i.e.,the fact that the lexical item can appear in varying linguistic environments.
Second, this is in keepingwith the TAG notion of using complex elementary structures to capture linguistic properties and havingvery general operations (substitution and adjunction) to combine these structures.
This has been usedeffectively in computational applications and is characterised by the slogan complicate locally, simplifyglobally (Bangalore and Joshi, 2010).4 AnalysisIn a noun-centric analysis, the light verb does not have arguments of its own.
The full array of argumentsfor the light verb construction is instead represented in the nominal?s tree.
The light verb can only choose3Based on the comments of the reviewers we are now considering a revision of the noun-centric analysis in this paper.
Itmay seem that a verb-centric analysis may be more appropriate for Hindi LVCs.
However, due to lack of space, we do notexplore the second option fully in this paper and leave it to future work.131the semantic property of the nominal it may combine with (e.g., the light verb ho may combine only withnominals that have no agentive arguments).
Other analyses e.g Ahmed et al.
(2012) represent the lightverb kar ?do?
with arguments of its own.
We discuss this in Section 5.Our work follows Han and Rambow (2000)?s representation of Sino-Korean LVCs.
This work hasalso proposed separate trees for the nominal and light verb.
The elementary tree of the nominal is an aninitial tree, and as it is considered the true predicate, it also chooses a syntactic structure that will realizeall its arguments.
The light verb on the other hand is represented as an auxiliary tree, therefore it is anadjunct to the nominal?s basic structure.
However, as it is a predicate, it is also a special type of auxiliarytree viz., a predicative auxiliary tree (Abeill?e and Rambow, 2000).The second feature of this analysis, also based on Han and Rambow (2000)?s work is the idea of thenominal as an underspecified base form.
The nominal?s elementary tree is not specified with respect toits category, rather, we use the label X, which projects to an XP.
We also assume, following Han andRambow that each node is specified with the feature CAT which has values like V or N, but the [CAT=N]feature on the noun is not realized unless the light verb composes with the elementary tree of the nominal.In addition, although the nominal is not a verb, it has the feature TENSE=- i.e., it is not tensed.4.1 The light verbIn order to model the light verb kar ?do?
in Example 2, we will construct an auxiliary tree with featurestructures, anchored at kar ?do?.
Figure 4 shows such an elementary tree.
Note that this is a very differenttree from ?full?
kar ?do?, which will have all its arguments.
The light verb kar is inflected for person,number, and gender as well as tense and aspect.
In this particular example, it is tensed, masculine, pluraland has perfective aspect; therefore it appears as kiye.
We assume that morphological analysis has alreadytaken place in a separate module, such that the correct morphological surface form has been derived for?do, masculine plural perfective?.
In Figure 4, the XPr(root) node and its right-branching daughtersare [CAT=V] with linguistic information about gender, number, tense and aspect.
The feature AGT=+ atthe top node implies that this auxiliary tree needs to unify with an initial tree that is also [AGT=+].
Incontrast with kar ?do?, the auxiliary tree of the light verb ho ?be?
will have [AGT=-].XPr[cat=v tense=+ perf=+ agt=+ agr=mpl][cat=v tense=+ perf=+ agt=+ agr=mpl]VP[cat=v tense=+ perf=+ agt=+ agr=mpl][cat=v tense=+ perf=+ agt=+ agr=mpl]V[cat=v tense=+ perf=+ agt=+ agr=mpl][cat=v tense=+ perf=+ agt=+ agr=mpl]kiyeXPf[cat=n tense=- case=nom nagr=-][]Figure 4: Elementary tree for light verb kar ?do?
inflected as kiye?do.masc.pl.perf?The XPf(foot) node has [TENSE=-] and [CAT=N], which will enable it to adjoin into the elementarytree of a nominal.
The CASE value is specified as NOM (nominative) as the light verb will assign nomi-native case to the noun.
The NAGR feature is required when the light verb agrees in number and genderwith the predicative nominal itself (Mohanan, 1997).
As this will not occur in the examples we areworking with, the value for NAGR is negative.
For other ?standard?
cases of agreement, the feature AGRis used (It is also useful to note that the verbal agreement rule in Hindi differs from English as the verbagrees with the highest nominative marked argument- and not necessarily the subject (Mohanan, 1995)).132S[cat=v tense=+ perf=+[1] agt=+[2]][cat=v tense=+ perf=[3] agt=[4]]VP[cat=v tense=+ perf=[3] agt=[4] agr=[11]][cat=v tense=+ perf=[5] agt=[6]agr=[10]]XP2[cat=v tense=+ perf=[5] agt=[6] agr=[10]][cat=[19] tense=- nagr=- case=[14]]X[cat=[19] tense=- nagr=- case=[14]][cat=[20] tense=- nagr=- case=[15]]choriiNP2????case=nomcat=nagr=[11]???NP1???

The feature clash at XP2is marked with a box.4.2 The nominalIn contrast to the impoverished argument structure of the light verb, the nominal in Figure 5 has the fullarray of arguments for chorii ?theft?.
The tree is anchored by the lexical item chorii and the non terminalsat NP1and NP2are marked with a ?
for substitution with the actual lexical items.The position of the arguments roughly follows the configuration described in Bhatt et al.
(2013, p. 59), where the first position is the ergative-marked argument and is found in a transitive sentence (but onlyif the property [PERF=+] is also present.
)The ?second?
position is one where the object of the transitive verb is found.
In Figure 5, this isrepresented as NP2and is the nominative marked argument.
The elementary tree for the nominal is notcomplete, because of the feature clash at XP2between [TENSE=+] vs. [TENSE=-].
The feature clashrepresents an obligatory adjunction constraint which will require the light verb to adjoin at this node.The first position in Figure 5 has the features for [PERF=+] and [AGT=+] as a consequence of having[CASE=ERG].
The agentive argument shares the values for PERF and AGT with the S node.
This ensuresthat the light verb that adjoins into this tree will match the PERF and AGT values in NP1.
The argumentin second position NP2will share its values for AGR with XP2.
At XP2, the values for PERF, AGT andAGR should match with the root node of the light verb.
Otherwise, adjunction will fail.The light verb?s tree as shown in Figure 4 will adjoin into the tree of the nominal.
Post adjunction andsubstitution, we find a composed structure as seen in Figure 7.The same noun chorii ?theft?
may combine with the light verb ho.
In that case, non-agentive chorii willchoose an elementary tree such as Figure 6.
This elementary tree appears without an agentive argument.Its single nominative Theme argument has moved to the first position at NP1, leaving behind a co-indexedtrace.
Figure 6 shows that the site of adjunction into chorii ?theft?
(non-agentive) is at XP1.
Adjunctioncannot take place at XP2as the feature clash is higher up at XP1.
The single nominative argument ofchorii (non-agentive) will move up to NP1in order to receive nominative case from the node CAT=V(Note that the node immediately above NP2has an underspecified CAT feature and this requires theargument to move to a higher position).
The tree for non-agentive chorii will always combine with alight verb that is AGT=-.
Its Theme argument will take nominative case irrespective of the tense-aspectvalue of the verb.133S[cat=v tense=+ perf=[1] agt=[2] agr=[12]][cat=v tense=+ perf=[3] agt=[4] agr=[11]]XP1[cat=v tense=+ perf=[3] agt=[4] agr=[11]][cat=[18] tense=- nagr=- case=[14]]XP2[cat=[18] tense=- nagr=- case=[14]][cat=[19] tense=- nagr=- case=[15]]X[cat=[19] tense=- nagr=- case=[15]][cat=[20] tense=- nagr=- case=[16]]choriiNP2[cat=n]tiNP1i?

Substitution at the nodes NP1and NP2gives us Ram ne gehenechorii kiye ?Ram stole the jewels?1345 DiscussionThe elementary trees for chorii ?theft?
?both agentive and non-agentive are able to capture its alternationswith kar ?do?
and ho ?be?.
This is in contrast to Ahmed et al.
(2012)?s approach in an important way.They do not consider the nominal?s alternation with the light verb ho ?be?
as a light verb construction.Instead, they maintain that it has a resultative reading and provide a different analysis within the LexicalFunctional Grammar (LFG) framework.
In fact, the alternation with ho ?be?
provides a useful lexicalalternative to an alternative syntactic structure (such as a passive).
The alternation of the light verb ho?be?
and kar ?do?
is moreover a characteristic of a certain group of nominals only (not all can show thisalternation e.g., intizar ?waiting?
cf.
Ahmed and Butt (2011)).
Therefore, we maintain that chorii ho?theft happen?
is indeed a light verb construction.Ahmed and Butt (2011)?s analysis looks at the noun and light verb as co-predicators i.e., it is a verbcentric analysis.
While this is different from the proposed analysis here, it is not impossible to constructelementary trees where the light verb?s elementary tree consists of one argument i.e., the subject and thenominal (with its own argument) adjoins into it.
The pros and cons of these two approaches need to beexplored more thoroughly within the TAG framework and we leave this to future work.While this work has examined one class of nominals that occur as part of light verb constructions,it does not complete the analysis of light verb constructions in Hindi.
The behaviour of other nominalclasses remains to be explored.
There are also nominals that occur with light verbs other than kar ?do?and ho ?be?.
Finally, while the work presented here is mainly theoretical, it is in keeping with recentproposals for extracting a Hindi TAG grammar from a phrase structure treebank (Bhatt et al., 2012;Mannem et al., 2009).
The algorithm in Bhatt et al.
(2012) relies on the annotated Hindi DependencyTreebank and proposes a rule extraction system for elementary trees.
Therefore, the description of HindiLVCs in TAG would be a useful addition to the implementation of a grammar extraction task.AcknowledgementsThe first author was supported by DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst) for a researchstay at the University of Konstanz in 2013-14s.
