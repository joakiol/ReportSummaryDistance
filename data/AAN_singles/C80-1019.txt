CONCEPTUAL TAXONOMY OF JAPANESE VERBS FOR UNDERSTANDINGNATURAL LANGUAGE AND PICTURE PATTERNSNaoyuki OkadaDepartment of Information Scienceand Systems EngineeringOita UniversityOita 870-11, JapanSummaryThis paper presents a taxonomy of "matterconcepts" or concepts of verbs that play rolesof governors in understanding natural languageand picture patterns.
For this taxonomy we asso-ciate natural language with real world picturepatterns and analyze the meanings common to them.The analysis shows that matter concepts are di-vided into two large classes:"simple matter con-cepts" and "non-simple matter concepts."
Fur-thermore, the latter is divided into "complexconcepts" and "derivative concepts."
About 4,700matter concepts used in daily Japanese were ac-tually classified according to the analysis.
Asa result of the classification about 1,200 basicmatter concepts which cover the concepts of realworld matter at a minimum were obtained.
Thisclassification was applied to a translation ofpicture pattern sequences into natural language.1 IntroductionAs is generally known, the intellectual ac-tivities of human beings are very instructive inhigher processing of natural language and pic-ture patterns, especially real world picturepatterns.
There are three sides to intellectualactivity:(i) Recognition and understanding.
(2) Thinking und inference.
(3) Expression and (intellectual) action.The system of concepts or knowledge plays anessentially important role in each activity.
Thebase of the system is considered to be placed onthose concepts formed by direct association withthe real world, which are closely related withboth syntactic and semantic structures of nat-ural language.
The aim of this paper is to makethis system clear from the linguistic viewpoint.1-3There are two linguistic approaches to theanalysis of the system.
One is the understandingof the outline of the whole system and the otheris the detailed analysis of a small part of thesystem.
Compilation of a thesaurus is consideredof the former type.
Thesauruses compiled so far,4,5 however, are not sufficient for machine pro-cessing because of the following:i. Abstraction processes of conceptsAs shown in Sect.
2.2, it is important tointroduce abstraction processes or conceptuali-zation processes to the system not only for itssystematic analysis but also for the "under-standing'of natural language and picture pat-terns.
The processes are not taken into consid-eration in ordinary thesauruses.2.
Interrelation among conceptsTo know semantic interrelation among wordsare indispensable for natural language process-ing.
This information is not explicitly express-ed in ordinary thesauruses.3.
Criterion for classificationIn machine processing it must be shown why aword is classified into such and such term.
Or-dinary thesauruses do not stress the criteria.Concepts of verbs are the core of the systemfrom the linguistic viewpoint.
We classify al-most all concepts of verbs in daily Japanese byassociation of natural language with the realworld, answering the above-mentioned problems.As for problem i, a working hierarchy along anabstraction process is constructed in the systemAs for problem 2, case frames are shown in "sim-ple matter concept," and connecting relationsamong elementary matter concepts are shown in "non-simple matter concept."
As for problem 3, analgorithm is introduced into the classification.2 Preliminary Considerations2.1 Meaning Common to Natural Language and Pic-ture PatternsPutting aside what the meaning of a picturepattern is, let's first discuss how it can beunderstood.
When a picture pattern or picturepattern sequence is given, an infinite number ofstatic or dynamic events can generally be ob-served within.
Suppose that the meaning of eachevent is described in natural language--in fact,one can express almost all events in naturallanguage apart from the question of efficiency__these descriptive sentences will amount to aninfinite number.
An ordinary sentence is reducedinto simple sentences, each of which is governedsyntactically and semantically by a verb.
Sincethere is a finite number of verbs in each lan-guage, the meanings of an infinite number of theevents involved are roughly divided into themeanings of those verbs and their interrelations.Now, what is the meaning of picture pat-terns ?
In the case of circuit diagrams or chem-cal structural formulas, we can think of the se-127-mantics because they have signs and syntacticrelations.
In the case of real world picturepatterns, however, there exists neither signs norsyntactic relations.
Here we observe real worldobjects named by human beings.
If we considerthem something like signs, we can think of thesyntax, and then the semantics, too.
The mean-ings are common to natural language and picturepatterns, although their syntactic structuresdiffer largely from each other.2.2 Paradigms for Interpretation and Understand-k~In order to clarify the notions of interpre-tation and understanding, first, we propose aworking hierarchy of knowledge along the ab-straction process, as follows:Level 1 Raw data Data close to copies ofLevel 2Level 3Level 4Level 5O000 L~iLevel 5things and events in the real world.Image-like data.Data of visual features Featuresextracted from raw data.Data of conceptual features Sym-bolic data associated with visualfeatures.
Some of them correspond toChomsky's syntactic features in thelexicon.
6Concept data Data obtained by or-ganizing conceptual features.
Mostdata have names as words.
In case ofthe verb they roughly correspond toMinsky,s surface semantic frames.
7Interconnected concept data Net-works of concept data.
A concept canbe interconnected with other con-cepts from various viewpoints.Interconnectedconcept data \[Level 4\[Data of conceptlLevel 3Data of concep-\]tual featuresLevel 2Data of visualI features003 Level 1H~ Raw data(Level 0 ')\]~ ~ Lktion process\]Schank,s scripts can be regarded asone of this type.
8 Some networkshave names as words.Fig.
1 shows the hierarchy.
"Interpretation"is considered as an association of the data atone level with another level.
(Here input imagesare considered as level zero data.)
Since theknowledge system has several levels and eachlevel has many domains, interpretation is possi-ble in many ways.
If an interpretation is per-formed under a certain control system that spec-ifies which level and which domain the inputdata should be associated with, it is called "understanding.
"As the level number increases, a level be-comes higher because abstractions of conceptsproceed.
But, which is deeper, level 1 or level5 ?
In natural language understanding, inputsentences will probably be interpreted initiallyat level 4 or 5, then the interpretation may de-scend to level i, where level 1 might be deeperthan either level 4 or 5.
However, if the inter-pretation of a picture pattern proceeds fromlevel 1 to 5, we think level 5 as the deeperlevel.The knowledge system is so massive and com-plicated that it is necessary to make systematicanalyses.
Since the number of verbs are finite,concepts of verbs at level 4 provide a clue tosystematic and exhaustive analyses of knowledgefrom the linguistic viewpoint.The concepts of verbs are divided into twolarge classes:"simple matter concepts" and "non-simple matter concepts."

1 Hierarchy of the knowledge systemThe simple matter conceptsare not reduced into any moreelementary matter conceptswhile the non-simple ones arereduced.
Most of them are soconcrete that they are wellanalyzed by direct associationidentified by a verb is called"matter."
Unlike things matterdoes not occur alone.
It arisesaccompanied by things, events,and attributes, which are call-ed "constituents," so this con-cept can be regarded as theconcept of a dynamic or staticrelation among constituents andbe expressed byv(s,o,of,ot,om, Os,Ow,Oc,p,t,r,.

.
.
.
.Out of these, eight constituents s through o care obligatory because they are indispensablefor the recognition of matter.
In Japanese sen-tences, the obligatory constituents are oftenaccompanied with such postpositional words as s-ga, o-o, of-kara, ot-ni, om-to , os-ni, ow-de,and oc-tO.
But it is difficult to decide thecase of a constituent only by such postposition-al words.The combination of obligatory constituentsdecides the basic frame of matter concepts.
Ta-ble 1 was obtained after an elaborate investiga-tion of more ~han 1,500 simple matter concepts.Two comments must be added to Table i. First,optional constituents participate fairly free-ly in matter.
Table 1 says nothing about thisproblem.
Next, some obligatory constituents arenot obligatory in every case.M1 (konoha-ga eda-kara) ochiru.
(A leaf) falls (from the branch).M2 (botan-ga shatu-kara) toreru.
(A button) comes off (the shirt).In M1 of eda(branch) is optional because ochiruis recognized by observing the vertical movementof a leaf, while in M2 of shatsu(shirt) is ob-ligatory because toreru is not recognized with-out the existence of a shirt.
Constituents of,ot, Ow, and o c belong to such a group.3.2 Semantic ContentsIn case of semantic contents it is difficultto classify them by examining the combination ofconstituents, so we adopted a trial-and-errormethod extracting features for classificationfrom the concepts.
Letting a set of simple mat-ter concepts under consideration be C, the fea-ture extraction from ?
is performed by the fol-lowing recursive procedure:Step 1Select several elements having similar con-tents from ?
and extract from them a feature (~)which makes them similar.Step n(>2)Let the features extracted up to step (n-l)be Cl, c2,.
.... ,Cn_ I.
Extract a feature (c n) inthe same way as step i.
(The element so far se-lected may be adopted in the extraction.)
Andcompare c n with each ci(l~i_<n-l).i) If c n is independent with each ci, adopt itas a feature and go to step (n+l).2) Otherwise,2.1) if the contents of Cn/C i contains that ofci/Cn, adopt c n as an upper/lower-grade featureof c i and go to step (n+l).2.2) Otherwise, make c n as a special featureand go to step (n+l).Table 1No.

Here distribution was ob-tained by the classification of Chapter 5.
InTable 2, the first digit 0, 1 and 2 in the clas-sification numbers roughly represent movement,change, and state, respectively.1294 Non-Sim~le M~tter ConceptsGenerally, non-simple matter concepts are soabstract in comparison with simple ones that itis hard to show a clear association of naturallanguage with the real world.
We emphasize theanalysis of how they are composed of simple ones.4.1 Complex Concept AIf two elementary matter concepts v iand vj(not necessarily simple ones) areconnected according to one of the rulesshown in Table 3 and the connected conceptis expressed by a Japanese complex word oftwo verbs for v i and vj, it is called a '~complex concept of A."
The rules in Table 3were obtained from the investigation of a-bout 900 matter concepts which consist oftwo matter concepts and are expressed by aJapanese complex word.In rule XXI.I, vj(deru) is an upper-grade concept of vi(af~reru) and containsthe contents of vi.
Rule XXI.I is concernedwith the whole and a part of the same mat-ter, while rule XXI.IIwith two differentmatters.
The former is considered as a spe-cial case of the latter in which two mat-ters coincide with each other.Rule XXI and XXllare logical while ruleXXI\[I is linguistic.
As "cause" is one ofthe constituents in (A) in Sect.
3.1, XXImay be considered as a part of XX~II .The semantic contents of complex con-cept A consists of the v i and vj contentsand their connecting relation.4.2 Complex Concept BComplex concept B consists of severalelementary matter concepts and is usuallyexpressed by a Japanese simple word.
How-ever, no general rule can be found to con-nect elementary matter concepts, so a hier-archical analysis was made for a small num-ber of complex concepts of B as shown inFig.

The relation a-mong elementary matter concepts can not well beexpressed by enumerating each verb as in thecase of complex concept A.

If such necessities often arise and therelationship is conceptualized, it will be effi-cient to give it a name.As for semantic contents, elementary matterconcepts and their relationship form a surfacecontents.
Approximately 1,000 complex conceptsof B were investigated according to the featureextraction method in Sect.
3.2 and the result istabulated in Table 5.4.3 Derivative ConceptSome concepts possess a function of derivinga new concept by operating others.
Matter con-cepts derived from operative concepts with bothmorphemic structures and derivative informationas shown in Table 6 and 7 respectively are call-ed "derivative concepts."
Table 7 was obtainedfrom the investigation of about 700 matter con-cepts, most of which are expressed by a complexword and one concept is operative to the other.The derivative information is very similar tothe modal information of auxiliary verbs, but itdiffers in that some matter concepts are operat-ed upon and those operations are fixed.5 ClassificationIn order to determine whether analyses inChapter 3 and 4 are good or not, we classifiedabout 4,700 basic matter concepts in daily Japa-nese, which are listed in "Word List by SemanticIPreprocessing 1IC!assification of derivative concepts\]\[Classif icati0nof complex concepts of A\]lCl@ssification of complex concepts of B\]\]Classif%cation of simiiar concepts IIClassification of ~tandard.c0ncepts IFig.

3 and 4.
The elementsor members of Vx(x=T,U,...) are denoted by Vxi(i=1,2,.'.)
and the sum and difference in the settheory are denoted by + and -, respectively.i) PreprocessingFor each VTi of VT,i.i) examine whether VTi functions with othersor by itself.
If it functions with others, thenit is excluded from V T.Example.
-ga~u;1.2) examine whether there is VTh(h<i ) whichhas the same contents as VTi and is expressedby the same verb as V~i.
If there is such VTh,VTi is excluded from VT.Let,s denote a class of concepts excluded byI.I) and 1.2) by Vp and let VU=VT-Vp.2) Classification of derivative conceptsFor each VUi of YU,2.1) if VUi is expressed by a derivative word,it is classified as a member of term L in Table6.
It is further classified in more detail ac-cording to Table 7;2.2) if VUi is expressed by a complex word oftwo verbs and one of these verbs is affixal,then it is regarded as a member of term LI inTable 6, and classified in more detail accord-ing to Table 7;2.3) if VUi is expressed by neither a deriva-tive word nor a complex word, but it is regard-ed as a member of one of the terms in Table 7,it is classified into that term.
At the sametime, it is classified into term L~ in Table 6.Let this class of concepts thus obtained beVD.3) Classification of complex concepts of AFor each VUi(@VDj) of VU, if VUi is express-ed by a complex word of two verbs and each con-cept functions by itself, it is considered as acomplex concept of A and classified according toTable 3.The class thus obtained is denoted by V A.4) Classification of complex concepts of BFor each VUi(~VDj,VAk) of VU, if its con-tents does not belong to any term in Table 2, itis regarded as a complex concept of B.
The classthus obtained is denoted by V B and subject tothe following process:For each VBi ,4.1) examine its surface structure and classifyit according to Table i;4.2) examine its surface contents and classifyit according to Table 5.Let V~=VD+VA+VB andVs=Vu-V  ~.5) Classification of similar conceptsIn class V S of simple matter concepts, ifthere is a group with similar contents, choose aconcept as the standard, then classify the re-132 -mainder as similar concepts.Example.
Korogeru(roll)~ korobu(roll), ma-robu(roll), etc.
are similar concepts for stand-ard concept korogaru(roll).Counter-example.
Saezuru(chirp), hoeru(bark), unaru(roar), inanaku(neigh), etc.
are notsimilar concepts for standard concept naku(cry).Here, it is assumed that if a certain con-cept is a standard concept, it is not a similarconcept for another standard one at the sametime.The class of similar concepts thus obtainedis denoted as V s and let Vb=VS-V s.6) Classification of standard conceptsFor each Vbi of Vb,6.1) examine its structural pattern and classi-fy it according to Table i;6.2) examine its semantic contents and classifyit according to Table 2.In the above process 2) through 6), one con-cept can be classified into two or more terms ifnecessary.5.2 Results and DiscussionFirst, let's discuss the relation among theobtained classes along the abstraction process.There are two kinds of abstraction processes:(i)extracting common features from concepts as fol-lows; bulldog--+dog-~animal--~living thing--~thing,(ii) connecting several concepts to form a newconcept as shown in complex concept B.
From thelatter viewpoint, the relation among classes isschematized as indicated in Fig.
5.Fig.
5 Relation among obtained classesSimple matter concepts (V b) are regarded asthe base of matter concepts in the sense that V bcovers the concepts of real world matter at aminimum and every other matter concept is ledfrom V b by a rule.
Two simple matter conceptsare connected by a rule and form a little bitabstract concept or complex concept of A. Sever-al matter concepts are organized by a fairlycomplicated rule into a new abstract concept orcomplex concept of B.
One of the elementary con-cepts in a complex concept of A changes itsmeaning diachronically and becomes a derivativeoperator.
So, the system of Japanese verb con-cepts has its own nature--although it is a factthat a large part of the system is universal--and is not manipulated at one level.Next, Table 8 indicates the distribution ofall matter concepts.
The minute distribution inTable 8 Distribution of matter conceptsClass DistributionVS ( VbVsVg Vc VBVD1,209529901951665VU 7 ?S + ~ 4,255Vp 485V T = V U + Vp 4,740each class has been shown in Table 2, 5 and 7,respectively.
Table 8 is instructive in investi-gating the human competence in organizing thelanguage system.
For example, if class Yb is re-garded as "primitive" concepts, number 1,209 ofVb does not side with Schank's classification, 9but with Minsky's idea.
7 From Table 2, 5 and 7,we can measure the degree of human concern aboutreal world matter.
For example, term 0.0 in Ta-ble 2 shows human beings are most interested indisplacements of objects.Finally, we consider that every matter con-cept under consideration was classified satis-factorily supporting our analyses.6 Translation of Picture PatternSequences into Natural LanguageAs an application of this taxonomy, systemSUPP(Syvstem for --Understanding Picture Patterns)was constructed.

6 Organization of the system6.1 Knowledge SystemThe knowledge system consists of four compo-nents, visual, conceptual, linguistic and the-saurus.
The visual component contains models ofprimitive pictures and syntactic rules, whichcorrespond to level 2 data in Fig.
i.
The rulesare applied to picture pattern pairs called "be-fore-after" frame pairs.
7The conceptual component contains conceptualfeatures, concepts, and networks of concepts,133which correspond to level 3 through 5 data, res-pectively.
A matter concept is expressed by\[v : ClC2.
'.cldl(El)d2(E2)'..dm(Em)\] (B)where each c i denotes a feature of matter itselfand is associated with a syntactic rule mention-ed above.
Each dj( ) denotes the case or roll ofa constitnent and must be filled by a specificinstance or concept of constituent.
Features Ej(=ejlej2...ejn ) specify the conditions its as-slgnment must meet.
A network is constructed a-mong similar matter concepts.The linguistic component consists of dic-tionaries for the production of Japanese andEnglish sentences.
The thesaurus component con-tains all the classified concepts in Chapter 5and supports the development of other components.6.2 Translation ProcessA sequence of picture patterns, or two-di-mensional line drawings(handwriting is allowed),is input at time t0,tl,...,tn.
A picture patternat ti(0~i~n-l) is paired with the one at ti+l,and processed as follows:i) Primitive picture recognition and syntacticanalysisThe picture pattern reader is a curve fol-lower that traces line segments by octagonalscanning.
The recognizer is based on Evans'smatching program for graph-like line drawingsbut is improved to handle noisy ones.
13The syntactic analyzer A decomposes thecomplex picture, in which two or more primitivepictures may intersect or touch each other, andrecognizes them according to Gestalt criteria.The syntactic analyzer B performs Boolean opera-tions on quantized primitive pictures to checksuch a relation as "MAN INSIDE HOUSE."
The syn-tactic analyzer C performs numerical operationson the data such as coordinates and transforma-tional coefficients of primitive pictures.2) Semantic analysis and inferenceThe semantic analyzer detects the meaning ofmatter-centred change in picture pattern pairsby top-down analysis.
Suppose that matter \[v(s,oa): ClC2...Clds(es)doa(eo~)\] is directed by theInference.
The analyzer assigns the role of s toone of the primitive pictures, say Ps, afterchecking whether Ps meets e s. It assigns therole of o~ to another primitive picture Poa inthe same way.
Then it analyzes each c i by call-ing a correspondent sub-program in the syntacticanalyzer B or C. If all the analyses end in suc-cess, the meaning of v(s,oa) is detected, Thepresent Inference makes inferences about all thesimilar concepts in the network in depth-firstorder, directing each matter concept at a nodeto the semantic analyzer.Finally, the synthesizer produces Japaneseand English simple sentences.6.3 ExperimentsAll the programs except the picture patternreader are written in Fortran and run under theOS~/VS of the FACOM 230-38S medium scale com-puter at Oita University.
Running with the syn-tactic analyzer B and C, the semantic analyzeroccupies approximately 200K bytes of core.
Mem-ory usage for all the dictionaries except thethesaurus component amounts to approximately 90Kbytes.Fig.
7 and 8 indicate an example of therecognition of a primitive picture and thetranslation of a picture pattern pair, respec-tively.
It took 47 seconds to recognize "bird\[l\]"in Fig.

(b) Output sentencesTranslation of a picture pattern pair134As for (i) it is important to enumerate all thereadings of the input picture pattern pair.
Theoutput sentences in Fig.
8 shows SUPP under-stands to a fair degree the change in the input.As for (ii) the ability in detecting semanticanomaly is important.
SUPP checks it by Ej in (B) in Sect.
6.1, but a little bit anomalous sen-tence 5) or 7) is output because the constructeddictionary of matter concepts is slightly insuf-ficient.
As for (JJi) the ability in paraphrasingsentences is needed.
Output sentences 4) through7) are an analytical paraphrase of "THE BIRD\[i\]PERCHES ON THE TREE" although SUPP has no know-ledge about "perch.
"7 ConclusionsA taxonomy of Japanese matter concepts hasbeen described.
It is summarized as follows:Simple matter conceptStandard conceptfstructural pattern ; types 12~semantic contents ; 20 featuresSimilar conceptNon-simple matter conceptComplex concept Aconnecting rule 3 typessemantic contents ; each contents ofelements and their connecting re-lationComplex concept Bconnecting rule ; different in eachconceptsurface contents ; 14 featuresDerivative concept ;derivative operator ; types 3derivative information ; 9 featuresThis taxonomy has made clear the outline ofthe system of all matter concepts in daily Japa-nese, and by SUPP picture pattern understandingresearch has come closer to natural language un-derstanding research.AcknowledsementThe author started his investigation of Jap-anese matter concepts and the development ofSUPP some ten years ago when he was at KyushuUniversity.
