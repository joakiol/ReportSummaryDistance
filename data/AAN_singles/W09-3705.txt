Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Computational Semantics, pages 18?32,Tilburg, January 2009. c?2009 International Conference on Computational SemanticsComputing Genitive SuperlativesJohan BosUniversity of Rome ?La Sapienza?bos@di.uniroma1.itSuperlative expressions (such as ?the tallest boy?)
single out en-tities by comparing them to others with respect to a set of prop-erties.
Therefore, a proper semantics for a superlative expressionrequires a correct computation of the comparison set.
In mostof the cases, this can be done in a compositional fashion (leavingcontextual influences aside).
When superlative adjectives occurin prenominal genitive constructions (such as ?his most expen-sive car?, this isn?t so straightforward anymore.
Three solutionsare proposed, that all change the underlying syntactic structureof the genitive construction in order to arrive at a correct com-parison set.
The solution where ordinary nouns are analysed?relationally?
is preferred, because it requires the least num-ber of modifications of the grammar.
Under certain conditions,superlatives also exhibit so-called comparative readings (as op-posed to absolute readings).
With the current machinery it ishowever impossible to account for such readings in a composi-tional way.1 IntroductionThe superlative construction singles out entities as having some property tothe greatest (or smallest) degree.
In English, superlative adjectives are nor-mally preceeded by the definite article or a possessive; one-syllable adjectivesand some two-syllable adjectives end in -est, some words of two syllables andall words of three or more syllables are preceeded most (or least).
Here aresome examples (superlatives underlined):(1) ... the tallest boy ...(2) ... AS Roma?s quickest player ...18(3) ... the Big Board?s most respected floor traders ...An adequate semantics of the superlative construction presupposes a propercomparison set ?
the entities that are compared.
In this paper we discussthe interaction between superlative adjectives and genitive constructionsand their effect on the construction of the comparison set.
We argue thatthe mainstream analysis of superlatives in prenominal genitive expressionsis troublesome.We provide the various syntactic analyses in Combinatory CategorialGrammar (CCG, [Ste01]) with Discourse Representation Theory [KR93]functioning as model-theoretical framework.
We demonstrate the syntax-semantics interface for a sentence with simple superlative adjective in Sec-tion 2 and then show why possessives complicate the formation of a correctcomparison set in Section 3.
We discuss so-called comparative readings inSection 4 and show what role the genitive plays in blocking certain interpre-tations.2 Superlatives and the Syntax-Semantics InterfaceIt is well known that superlatives can be analysed in terms of comparativeconstructions [Wal72].
Accordingly, ?the R-est X?
denotes an X such thatthere is no Y different from X that is R-er.
This is also the approach we willfollow in our theory of superlatives, in which we use CCG (CombinatoryCategorial Grammar, [Ste01]) to provide us with a syntactic analysis, andDRT (Discourse Representation Theory, [KR93]) to produce semanticallyinterpretable structures.In what follows we will illustrate the formalism with an example.
Wewill give a CCG derivation and introduce some of the relevant terminology.Then we will show how the syntax-semantics interface works by composi-tionally constructing a semantic representation for a sentence containing asuperlative.The version of CCG that we use in the context of this article comprisesfour atomic categories (s, np, n, pp), functor categories such as np/n (de-terminer) and (s\np)/np (transitive verb) and the combinatory rules [fa](forward application), [fc] (forward composition), and [ba] (backward ap-plication).
We indicate lexical categories by [lex] in derivations.
Note thatslashes indicate directionality: X/Y denotes a functor category looking foran argument of category Y on its right, yielding category X; X\Y is a func-tor category looking for an argument Y on its left.
Now consider a basic19example of a sentence with a simple superlative adjective, and its analysisin CCG:tallest boy------[lex] ---[lex]the n/n n---[lex] -----------------[fa]saw np/n n---------[lex] ---------------------------[fa]I (s\np)/np np--[lex] -------------------------------------------[fa]np s\np----------------------------------------------------[ba]sOn the basis of the syntactic structure that CCG gives us we can build asemantic representation in a bottom-up fashion.
We do so by employing aversion of lambda-DRT [Mus96, vEK97]: all lexical entries are associatedwith lambda-DRSs.
The number of abstracted variables mirrors the syntac-tic type of the CCG category.1The derivation given above tells us that we combine ?tallest?
and ?boy?first, under guidance of the [fa] rule.
Consider first the lambda-DRS foreach of these words separately (we use the ; operator to indicate a merge(signifying dynamic conjunction) between DRS, and we take the @ symbolto mean function application):?tallest?CAT: n/nDRS: ?P.?x.
(P@x;(yy6=x;P@y)?taller(x,y))?boy?CAT: nDRS: ?u.boy(u)The superlative introduces a complex condition, stating that whatever entityis selected with property P, it is taller than all other entities with property P.We simply assume that superlatives introduce a two-place ordering relation,a relation which can be characterised as asymmetric and transitive.2In ourexample ?tallest?
introduces taller(x,y), a relation that orders entities inthe domain with respect to their size.
(It is a transitive relation, because1In terms of Van Eijck and Kamp?s semantic type system [vEK97], with the basictypes e for entities and T for state transitions, the category s corresponds to T , n and ppcorrespond to ?e, T ?, and np to ?
?e, T ?, T ?.
So there is strict type-transparancy betweenthe syntactic types of CCG and the semantic types of lambda-DRT expressions.2A bad semantics, in Van Benthem?s view [vB83], because it wouldn?t explain and onlydescribe the behaviour of comparatives.
That might be true from a philosophical point ofview ?
from a computational semantics perspective it is quite practical.20if X is taller than Y, and Y is taller than Z, then X is taller than Z; it isasymmetric, because if X is taller than Y, then it is not the case that Y istaller than X.
)Going back to our example, the interpretation of the [fa] rule tellsus that the lambda-DRS of the functor category should be applied to thelambda-DRS of the argument category.
So we get this as intermediate result:?tallest boy?CAT: nDRS: ?P.?x.
(P@x;(yy 6=x;P@y)?taller(x,y)) @ ?u.boy(u)If we carry out the substitutions (for the lambda-bound variable P) in theprocess of ?-conversion we obtain the following lambda-DRS:?tallest boy?CAT: nDRS: ?x.
(?u.boy(u)@x;(yy 6=x;?u.boy(u)@y)?taller(x,y))Once more we can perform ?-conversion (for the lambda-bound inner vari-ables u) yielding the following lambda-DRS:?tallest boy?CAT: nDRS: ?x.
(boy(x);(yy6=x;boy(y))?taller(x,y))Finally we can carry out merge-reduction (the process of joining two DRSsinto one, by taking the unions of the discourse referents and the conditions,respectively) and arrive at a DRS which meaning can be glossed as ?theboy which is taller than every other boy?.
In this example, the comparisonset of the superlative expression is just the set of boys.
Its semantic scopeis established in the antecedent of the DRS conditional introduced by thelexical semantics of the superlative.3 Superlatives in Genitive Constructions3.1 The ProblemAs shown in the previous section, the analysis given to a superlative ad-jectives seems to be satisfactory: it can be done in a compositional way,and it yields the desired interpretation.
However, as noted in [BN06], this21analysis does not easily carry over to superlative expressions that combinewith prenominal genitive expressions (constructions marked by the clitic -?s or possessive pronouns), such as ?AS Roma?s fastest player?, ?his leastexpected answer?, and ?London?s most expensive restaurant?.
Why is thisthe case?Let?s consider the comparison set of AS Roma?s fastest player, which isnot just a set of players, but the set of players from AS Roma.
It seemshere that the superlative adjective out-scopes the possessive noun phrase.But this is not the effect that we get if we follow the standard analysis in acategorial grammar [Ste01, Hoc03, Car97]:AS Roma ?s fastest player-------[lex] ---------[lex] -------[lex] -----[lex]np (np/n)\np n/n n------------------------[ba] --------------------[fa]saw np/n n---------[lex] --------------------------------------------------[fa]I (s\np)/np np--[lex] -----------------------------------------------------------------[fa]np s\np--------------------------------------------------------------------------[ba]sIt is not difficult to see why.
Once we?ve analysed the sub-phrase ?fastestplayer?, we?ve basically fixed the scope of the comparison set in the lambda-DRS.
The antecedent DRS of the implicational condition, representing thecomparison set, is completed, and there is nothing we can do about it any-more ?
unless you?re in for some ad-hoc post-processing activities.
Weargue that the syntactic analysis for phrases such as the above is insufficientto get a correct semantic analysis, and therefore any compositional solutionwill involve work at the level of the syntax-semantics interface.3.2 Possible SolutionsWithin the framework of CCG, we present three ways to change the analysisto reach a proper treatment of prenominal genitives that interact with su-perlatives.
The first is Bos & Nissim?s solution to the problem [BN06].
Thesecond and third are inspired by work of Partee and Carpenter, respectively,who introduce different interpretations for the genitive to account for theambiguities that appear with inherently relational nouns ?
solutions thatalso seem to work well for our problem with genitive superlatives.223.2.1 Proposal I: Bos & Nissim 2006Bos & Nissim note the problem only manifests itself with prenominal geni-tives [BN06].
To fix it, they add a new syntactic (and semantic) type for theprenominal possessive.
A way of doing this is to recognise phrases such as?his most expensive?
and ?AS Roma?s fastest?
as determiner-like phrases,with CCG category np/n.
Under this view, let?s consider our problematiccase again.AS Roma ?s-------[lex] -----------------[lex]np ((np/n)/(n/n))\np fastest--------------------------------[ba] ----[lex](np/n)/(n/n) n/n player-------------------------------------------[fa] ------[lex]np/n n--------------------------------------------------------[fa]npNow consider the lambda-DRSs for the different lexical items in this exam-ple.
The only new category is the one for the clitic -?s, which is given thefollowing lexical semantics:?
?s?CAT: ((np/n)/(n/n))\npDRS: ?N.?S.?P.?Q.(u;(((S@?x.
(P@x;N@?y.of(x,y)))@u);Q@u))That is, the lambda-DRS for the possessive takes three arguments: the nounphrase, a superlative adjective, and a noun.
This results in a representationfor ?AS Roma?s fastest player?
shown as the lambda-DRS in (4).
(4)?AS Roma?s fastest player?CAT: npDRS: ?Q.
(x uplayer(x) of(x,u) AS-Roma(u)yplayer(y) of(y,u)x 6=y?faster(x,y);Q@x)This analysis yields the desired comparison set: we quantify over ?playersof AS Roma?, not just ?players?.
But arguably, the solution involves over-loading the possessive construction with a new CCG category that only isused in superlative constructions, lacking independent motivation.
So let?slook at an alternative.233.2.2 Proposal II: Partee 1997An alternative way of computing the comparison set for superlatives ingenitive expressions builds on Partee?s analysis for relational nouns [Par97,PB99].
Partee enriches the syntax by including a ?transitive common nounphrase?, along the usual common noun phrases.
As a result she also dis-tinguishes between two types of determiner in the genitive: one that selectstransitive nouns, and one that selects ordinary nouns.
Semantically, theformer receives an inherently relational interpretation (expressed by a two-place relation), and the latter a free interpretation, filled in by the context.We argue that almost any noun can be interpreted ?relationally?
whenit is part of a genitive.
By making the noun relational, we can leave thecreation of the comparison set to the clitic -?s, by giving it a category thatsubcategorises for a relational noun.
This ensures that all relevant materialenters the comparison set, as we will see in the example below.In order to achieve this, we introduce a new basic CCG category tn(transitive noun, Partee?s TCN) and an additional category tn/tn for su-perlative adjectives.
As in Partee?s grammar, we introduce an additionalcategory for the clitic -?s as well.
Hence, superlative adjectives can be as-signed two categories: n/n if they modify non-relational nouns, and tn/tnif they modify relational nouns.
This gives us the following Partee-styleanalysis for AS Roma?s fastest player:AS Roma ?s fastest player-------[lex] ----------[lex] -------[lex] ------[lex]np (np/tn)\np tn/tn tn-------------------------[ba] ---------------------[fa]np/tn tn----------------------------------------------------[fa]npSince we have several new CCG categories here, we need to proposecorresponding lambda-DRSs too.
(We assign the syntactic category tn thesemantic type ?e, ?e, T ??.)?
?s?CAT: (np/tn)\npDRS: ?N.?R.?P.(N@?x.
(y;(R@y)@x;P@y))?fastest?CAT: tn/tnDRS: ?R.?x.?y.
((zz 6=x;(R@z)@y)?faster(x,z);(R@x)@y)24?player?CAT: tnDRS: ?x.
?y.player(x,y)The lambda-DRS that will result from the derivation given above is tanta-mount to the one presented in (4).
So this proposal computes the correctcomparison set, but at the cost of introducing a new atomic CCG category.Could we have avoided this?3.2.3 Proposal III: Carpenter 1997The third propopal resembles the second, but it doesn?t introduce new basicCCG categories.
It adopts the idea of Partee to distinguish nouns from rela-tional nouns, but instead of giving it a new basic category, we give it the func-tor category n/pp, inspired by Carpenter [Car97], who introduced a secondlexical category for the possessive that ?consumes a nominal complementthat itself seeks a complement?.
In Carpenter?s type-logical framework thisinterpretation of the possessive receives the category np\(np/(n/np:of)).Translated into CCG we get the following CCG derivation for our runningexample:AS Roma ?s fastest player-------[lex] --------------[lex] ------------[lex] -----[lex]np (np/(n/pp))\np (n/pp)/(n/pp) n/pp-----------------------------[ba] -------------------------[fa]np/(n/pp) n/pp------------------------------------------------------------[fa]npThere are no new basic CCG categories (the category pp is used inde-pendently in CCG for prepositional complements [Ste01]), but the structureof the derivation is identical to that of Proposal II.
Semantically, however, itis slightly different, and in a way closer to Proposal I, because the possessiverelation is introduced by the clitic -?s and not by the relational noun:?
?s?CAT: (np/(n/pp))\npDRS: ?N.?R.?P.(z;(R@?x.
(N@?y.of(y,z)))@z;P@z)?fastest?CAT: (n/pp)/(n/pp)DRS: ?R.?P.?x.
((yy 6=x;(R@P)@y)?faster(x,y);(R@P)@x)?player?CAT: n/ppDRS: ?P.?x.
(player(x);P@x)253.3 EvaluationWhich proposal is better?
The first proposal changes the structure of thederivation for basic superlatives as given in the previous section, but doesn?tintroduce new basic categories.
The second and third proposal have thesame syntactic structure as the original CCG analysis; but the former doesso at the cost of introducing a new basic CCG category.
Arguably, the thirdproposal has a more intuitive semantics.
In sum, Proposal III seems the bestchoice for analysing superlatives in possessive constructions.
As an addedbonus, a reformulation of the postnominal genitive construction will yield asemantic representation tantamount to the prenominal one:of AS Roma-----[lex] -------[lex]the fastest player pp/np np----[lex] ----------[lex] ------[lex] --------------------[fa]np/n n/n n/pp pp----------------------[fc] ---------------------------------[fa]np/n n-------------------------------------------------------------[fa]npFurthermore, under Proposal II and III one could argue that the prenom-inal genitive always subcategorises for a relational noun, independently fromthe presence of superlatives.
This would result in only one syntactic cate-gory for the clitic -?s, rather than the two categories we need to distinguishbetween relational and non-relational nouns.Finally, we are well aware that analysing the possessive relation for anoun N as ?N(x) & of(x,y)?, as in Proposal I and III, is problematic forvarious reasons.
First of all, it doesn?t explain what kind of relation thereis between the two entities.
Secondly, it will give sometimes the wrong pre-dictions; we would wrongly predict that ?Vincent?s boss is Mia?s husband?entails that Mia?s boss is Vincent?s husband!3It is a problem independentfrom the objectives of the paper.
A solution would be to analyse phrasesuch as ?husband of Mia?
as ?x.
[person(x) & ?y(role(x,y) & husband(y) &of(y,mia))], paraphrased as the ?person who is playing the role of Mia?s hus-band?.
However in the context of this paper we will analyse the possessiveusing the simplified (but semantically inadequate) analysis.3This was kindly pointed out to me by Steve Pulman, Yuliya Lierler, Vladimir Lifschitzand anonymous reviewers.264 Comparative ReadingsAn interesting behaviour of superlative expressions is their capacity to invokeso-called comparative readings, at least under certain conditions.
As theexamples and discussion in this section demonstrate, this is a complex issueand we don?t have a computational analysis to offer.
Nevertheless we domake some interesting new observations and present some fresh data.4.1 Comparative Readings and the GenitiveThere are other linguistic means to restrict the comparision set of superla-tive expressions, as is well known from the formal semantics literature onsuperlatives [Hei99, Sza86, Gaw95, FK00].
Consider the following examples:(5) Callum climbed the highest mountain.
(6) Who climbed the highest mountain?It has been observed that (5) and (6) have two distinct interpretations:an absolute reading and a comparative one.
The absolute reading of (5)is where Callum climbed a mountain higher than any other mountain (i.e.the highest mountain in the domain).
The comparative reading describes asituation where Callum climbed a higher mountain than anyone else climbed(but not necessarily the highest mountain in the context).The comparative reading is not always available, and even when it is,the absolute reading seems to be the preferred one.
Hence, an issue ofimportance is to know under what linguistic conditions the comparativereading is licensed.
As has been pointed out by [Sza86], the comparativereading requires association with focus (5) or a wh-question (6).
A furtherobservation is that a superlative expression such as ?the highest mountain?has a definite interpretation giving rise to the absolute reading, or can beunderstood indefinitely, in which (5) can be paraphrased as ?Callum climbeda mountain higher than anyone else climbed?
[Sza86].
We note that this viewcorrectly predicts that the comparative reading is not available when thesuperlative is part of a genitive construction (which are usually intrinsicallydefinite), as in (7) and (8):(7) Callum climbed Scotland?s highest mountain.
(8) Callum climbed the highest mountain of Scotland.27There are, by and large, two different proposals to account for the com-parative reading in superlative noun phrases: the movement theory, and thein-situ theory.
Neither of them is easy to implement.
Following the move-ment theory of superlative interpretation, the superlative quantifier -est canmove out of its noun phrase to a higher position in the sentence, and thenassociates with focus to build the comparison set [Hei99, Sza86].
The in-situtheory of superlatives [Hei99, FK00, Mat05] accounts for the comparativeinterpretation by treating the superlative as a quantifier that is contextuallyrestricted.As CCG is a lexicalised theory of grammar, it is natural to adopt anin-situ approach.
Let?s assume that nouns can either get the non-relational,?free?, interpretation (via the category n) or the relational interpretation(n/pp) as in Proposal III.
The latter category will always give rise to theabsolute reading, explaining the absence of the comparative reading in (7)and (8), because genitive contexts trigger the n/pp interpretation for nouns.4.2 Comparative Readings and Relational NounsThe transitive verb ?to have?
shows peculiar behaviour with inherently re-lational noun phrases as object [Par97].
It seems to be able to take barerelational noun phrases as argument, unlike other transitive verbs.
It alsoblocks noun phrase objects where relational nouns are part of a genitive.Consider the following contrasting cases (stars indicate non-grammaticalsentences):(9) John has a sister.
(10) ?
John has his sister.
(11) John has the smartest sister.
(12) ?
John has his smartest sister.
(13) ?
John has the smartest sister of Bill.
(14) ?
John has Bill?s smartest sister.Intriguingly, the only possible reading of (11) is the comparative one: forsome people with sisters, John is is the one that has a sister smarter thanevery other person with a sister.
There is no absolute reading in which ?thesmartest sister?
has a definite interpretation.28Partee wonders whether ?to have?
has a second possible interpretationbesides the transitive verb reading.
In terms of CCG, this verb would receivethe category (s\np)/(np/pp) in addition to (s\np)/np.
Assuming thatthis would be the case, it would be possible to come up with a semanticsfor ?have?
that would yield the desired interpretation for (11).
It would besomething like:?R.?N.(N@?x.
((R@?y.xof(y,x))@?y.have(x,y)))However, other examples prove that this would not be sufficient:(15) What city in Africa has the greatest population?
(16) What golf course has the highest slope rating?
(17) What cities have the worst automobile traffic?In (15), for example, the members of the comparison set are populations ofAfrican cities, not populations in general.
Similarly, in (16) we talk aboutslope ratings of golf courses, not of, say, amplifiers or agricultural vehicles;in (17) finally, the comparison set contains traffic in cities, not in countriesor regions.Given that this information is all provided within the sentence, one wouldexpect the compositional semantics to take care of that.
However, it is un-clear how the in-situ theory would get a correct interpretation of the su-perlatives using a compositional semantics.
We leave it as an open problem.4.3 Comparative Readings and MostThe availability of the absolute and relative reading is not a phenomenonthat manifests itself only with superlative adjectives.
A very similar effectcan be seen with the generalised quantifier most.
Consider (18) and (19):(18) Gloria sold most cars.
(19) Most babies are born in March.Example (18) has besides the absolute reading (for instance, in a situationwith twenty cars, and Gloria sold more than ten of them), also a comparativereading (for example, in a situation with twenty cars, where Gloria sold five,Kenny three, and James four).
A similar story can be told for (19): the29absolute reading, could be glossed as ?more babies are born March than in allother months together?, which doesn?t make much sense.
The comparativereading, where the number of babies born in each month are compared, ispreferred here.These are interesting examples, as a standard generalised quantifier se-mantics for ?most?, meaning ?more than half?, would not suffice to get acorrect interpretation for (18) and (19).
Again, we obviously don?t have asolution for dealing with this problem, but there is a clear correspondenceof behaviour with that of the superlative adjective.5 DiscussionIt is perhaps surprising that none of the available theories of superlatives([Hei99, Sza86, Gaw95, FK00]) say anything on how the genitive shouldbe integrated in a theory of superlatives, at least as far as the absolutereading is concerned.
Given this, it is perhaps not so sursprising, thatmost of the currently existing computational grammars for English do nothave a correct treatment of this phenomenon.
This does not only hold forthe CCG grammar on which this work was inspired [Hoc03], but also forother well-known wide-coverage parsers and grammars.
Analysing nounsas ?relational?
in genitive constructions would solve as least part of theproblem.A correct semantic analysis of comparative readings requires furtherwork: we still know little under which conditions such readings are present?
a thorough corpus study might give inspiration and shine new light onthe matter.
In addition, various other problems triggered by the superlativeare not dealt with in this paper.
One is the interpretation of plural entitiesin superlative expressions and interaction with ordinals.
Another issue con-cerns over-generation of the categorial grammar that we use.
The currentanalysis incorrectly supports extra-grammatical expressions such as ?the tallfastest player?, which would be of particular importance for generation tasks[vD06].References[BN06] Johan Bos and Malvina Nissim.
