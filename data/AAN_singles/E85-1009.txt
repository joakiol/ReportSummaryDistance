This paper wlll describe thecurren~ statn/s o f METAL, including theresults of the most recent evaluation, andwill briefly indicate some fur%Ire directionsfor the system.
Exhibits A and B (attached)are, respectively, a German original textand a raw (unedlted, but automaticallyreformatted) METAL translation of thatinto English.History and StatusMachine translation research at theUniversity of Texas began in 1956: the LRCwas founded in 1961.
Eor much o f thehi~cory of.
this project, funding wasprovided by the U.S. Air Force's Rome AirDevelopment Center and other U.S. gove~,m~ntagencies.
In 1979, Siemens AG began fundingthe development phase of the METAL machinetranslation sy~cez, at which pointi~lementat lon of the current system wasinitiated.
A prototype has recently beendelivered to the sponsor for market testing.The current system is a unidirectionalGerman-English system, although work to addot/%er target languages, as well as creatingan English-German MT system, is nowunderway.
The present staff for the METALproject consists of seven full-ti~e and fivehalf-tlme personnel.Application EnvironmentSoftware has been developed to handlethe formatting problems associated withtechnical manuals.
This software, writtenin SNOBOL, automatically marks and preparestexts for the METAL translation system\[Slocum and Bennett, 1982; Slocum eu al.
01984\].
The only human intervention prior totranslation is checking and correcting theresults o f t_he automatic formattingroutines.
Postediting is expected for theoutput t~.
The sys tem does not expect(or provide for) human intervention duringthe actual translation phase.Pre-processing and post-edlting arepresantly done on a DEC-2060; the actualtranslation, on a Symbolics Lisp machine.The "proch/ction ~ "  design envisions aLisp Machine as the translation unitco, necked to 4-6 ~ranslator workstations,from which t,he prepared ~ will be sentto the translation unit and on which theoutput texts will be postedlted.METAL uses a transfer approach fortranslation.
The entire process consists offour phases : analysis, integration,transfer, and generation (synthesis).
Theintegration phase works with whole parsetree st-ruc~ures, following analysis andpreceding transfer.
Until recently,transfer and generation were essentially asingle phase, but work is currently underwayto separate this single phase into ~wo, witha much more powerful generation phase.LlngulsKic ComponentThe curren~ METAL lexicon consists ofover 20,000 German and English monolingualentTies, cor~i~clng of morphological,syntactic, and s~nt lc  features and values,and an appropriately large number oftransfer entries.
The featnlres and valuesin monollngual lexlcal entries supplynecessary information for the analysisand/or synthesis of these it~m~ during themach/x~ translation process.
Most entriesare reasonably s4~le ,  but entries for verbst~m~ are significantly more complex.Inflected adjectives, nouns, and verbs areparsed by word-level gr~m-~r rules, with thestems and e~dlngs assigned to appropriatelexical categories.62Each t-Fans fer lexical entry is astructure equating the source languagecanonical form with an appropriate targetlanguage canonical form.
Certainsignif icant information (i. e., lexicalcategory, subject area, and preference) iscoded in the entry to guide the system inselecting the appropriate translation.Furthermore, tests and operations (includingtransformations) may be included withintransfer en~rles.The gr~r  for METAL consists of over600 augmented phrase s~ructure rules, eachof which is used in both analysis andtrans fer/generatlon.
METAL' s gr~-~-r rulesare used in the pars ing of all levels ofstructure from the word level to thesentence level, including phrases andclauses.
A METAL grammar rule consists o ffive analysis sections, plus an additionalsection for each target language: a top llnedescribing the phrase structure (with anoptional enumeration of each constituent); aseries of restrictions, which test theappropriateness of individual constituentson the r ight-hand side of the rule; TESTs,which enforce agreement among the r ight-handconstituents; a CONSTR section, whichconstructs the analysis of the phrase; anINTEC~ section, which is executed (once acomplete analysis of the sentence isachieved) in order to, e.g., resolveanaphoric references; and one or moretarget- language-dependent Transfer sections,which control lexlcal and structn/raltranslat ion into the target language.Homograph resolution and dis~mhiguatlonare handled uniformly (i.e., without specialpasses) , in various ways : by  orthographictests, such as t_he test to ensure that aword that looks llke a German noun is notali lower case; by  posit ional constraints,which disal low co-occurrence of -mhlguousstrings in the same clause location; and,most especial ly, by  the case framemechanism.The case (valency) frame mechanism isvital in METAL's analysis of German sourcelanguage sentences.
This mechanism isinvoked in clause-level rules and usesfeatures on the verb stem to define thefunctions of the various central ar~Jmentsto the predicate.
In additlon, the caseframe mechanism is used to test for sucht/llngs as subject-verb agreement.The METAL gramm=ar makes extensive useof transformations to modi fy  structure orperform certain tests.
Transformations maybe used in the TEST, CONSTR, INTEr ,  andTransfer phases of the rules,transformations may also be used in transferlexlcal entries.
A transformation may bewritten as part  of a rule or cal led by  name.Computat ional  ComponentThe lexicon for METAL is mainta ined viaa DBMS wri t ten in LISP.
Input of lexicalentries is faci l i tated by  an INTERCODER, amenu-dr lven system whlch asks the user forinformation in Engl ish and encodes theanswers into the internal form used by  thesystem.
An integral part  of the INTERCODERis the "lexical default" program whichaccepts" minlm~l information about the?
part icular entry (root form and lexicalcategory) and encodes most of the remainingnecessary features and values.
Entries mayalso be created using any text editor,without the aid of the INTERC0DER or lexicaldefaulter.Interfacing wi th  the lexical databaseis done by  means of a number of menu-dr ivenfunctions which permlt  the user to access,edit, copy, and/or delete entr iesindividually, in groups (using specif icfeatures), or entirely.
In order to assurea h igh degree of lexicon integrity the METALsystem includes val idat ion progr~m~ whichidentify errors in format and/or syntax.The val idat lon process is automatical ly usedto check lexlcal it~m~ which have beenedited, to ensure that no errors have beenintroduced during editing.The grammar is also in a database andmay be-accessed and/or edited in much thesame way as the lexicon.
System softwareand named trans formations are stored inindividual source files.METAL's parser  is a "some-paths,parallel, bot tom-upparser"  \[Slocum et al,1984\] .
It may be considered to be"some-paths" because the grammar rules aregrouped into numerical ly  indexed "levels"and the parser  always applies rules at alower level before applying rules at ahigher level.
Once the parser hassuccessful ly  bui l t  one or more Ss at a givenlevel, it wil l  halt; unti l  it discovers oneor more S readings, the parser wil l  continueto apply rules in each successive level.Extensive exper imentat ion with the systemhas found that the present parserconf igurat ion is the most eff ic ient one forMETAL \[Slocum et al, 1984\].Post-Edltors' EvaluationIn June, 1984, the METAL system wasused to translate 82.6 pages of text intoEnglish; the material  var ied from a salesprospectus (for a speech recognit ion system)through various general hardware andsoftware syste~ descr ipt ions to h ighlytechnical documentation.
The output wasthen edited by  ~wo Siemens revisors (one am~mher of the METAL project, one not) .

The number of pages of text was computed automatical ly on the basis of"Siemens standard pages": 26 l ines x 55 characters = 1430 characters/pg.
)The table above summarizes the editors'revision times.
They employed ratherdlf ferent edit ing techniques (editor #iworking in three passes, #2 in Just two),but their t imes are relat ively close.Comments by Editor #i :~he  3rd Pass\] tends to be concernedwith sTyl ist ic i~provements, formattingchanges and t~2plng errors.
The last part  ofthis stage involves running the spel l ingchecker on the file to el iminate remainingtyping errors.The ~mpress ion of post-edit ing was thatthere have been many improvements overprevious test runs.
This was evidenced bythe fact that on t/lls post-edlt ing run lessthan 57 o of sentences were re-translated fromscratch.
The major task in post-edit ing isnow changing word order, changing verbagreement and re-translat lng the moreidiomatic usages.
Considerable l~rovemen~sin format made post-edlt ing easier, althoughthere is stil l  room for further enhancement.and 3rd phases of post-edl t lng cont inued asnormal.
The previous problems wir/~post-edl t ing a h ighly  formatted text meantthat whenever a textual change was made inthe the te2Cc then the format had to bere-modi fled.
The method o f post -edi t ingu~ed in T-hls test proved to be considerablyfaster and easier to handle .
.
.
.
~heresults\] demonstrate that the t ime savinglles in the initial post-edlt  phase which iswhen the most  changes are made and which ismost t ime intensive with regard tore- formatting text.Comments by Editor #2:As compared to the last run in February1984, the June 84 output showed considerablei mprovement.
A greater number o f sentenceswas useable and m~ny required a change inword order only.
P lacement o f thedeterminers has been improved.
\[Certain\]points should be considered to Improvefuture translations.Future Direct ionsOne of the greatest changes affect ingpost-edlt ing was the fact that since theinitial output \[co~pared to earl ierversions\] of METAL was deemed to havei "~r oved, the dl f fe rmi  stages 0 fpost-edlt ing were more clearly defined.That is to say, it was easier to produce anadequate translat ion during the first runthrough the tex~ ~- using the reformattedoutput on the screen and a hardcopy of thesource text for reference -- than inprevious tests.
In the second run through atex~c -- using a hardcopy of the METAL outputupon which prel iminary post-edlt ing has beenperformed -- it was easier to concentrate onpol ishing the translatlon.
In the third andfinal post-edlt  stage, one was able to makea final check for styl ist ic weaknesses,spel l ing mistakes and typing errors.
Thiswas the same method as used in previoustests but one was better able to dist inguishbeUween the stages (initial teckulical andstyl ist ic post-edlt ing; pol ish ing output;final styl ist ic check) and the entireprocess was less t i r ing than in the past.A l though the overall format of theoutput has i~3roved.. .there are stil l  \[some\]problem areas \[with the automaticreformatt ing program\] .As an experlment, the unformatted,interl inear \[German-English\] version wasused for the initial post-edlt ing phase.The text was then reformatted.
.
.and the 2ndThe METAL German-Engl lsh conf igurat ion wasreleased for market  test ing in January 1985.Current p lans are to continue Imp~ rovement onthe present system and to branch off  intoother target languages, specif ical ly Spanishand Chinese.
We estimate that aGerman-Spanish system should be ready fortest ing sometime in 1986, wi th  aGerman-Chlnese system sometime thereafter.We have also begun working on anEngl lsh-German system.
If the p lanned workis success ful, work wll I begin onEngl ish-Spanish and Engl ish-Chinese MTsyst~m~.ReferencesSlocum, J., and W. S.
