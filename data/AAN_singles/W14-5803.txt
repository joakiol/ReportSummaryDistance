While we see a huge potential in the emerging Linguistic LinkedOpen Data, also supporting the publication of less-resourced language data on the same plat-form as for mainstream languages, we are wondering if, parallel to the widening of linkinglanguage data to both other language data and encyclopaedic knowledge present in the LinkedData cloud, it would not be beneficial to give more focus more on harmonization and mergingof RDF encoded lexical data, instead of establishing links between such resources in theLinked Data.
?1 IntroductionIn recent years a lot of initiatives have emerged towards the RDF based representation of languagedata and the hereby opened possibility to publish those data in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud1.This development has been leading to the establishment of a specialized Linked Data (LD) cloud forlanguage data.
The actual diagram of this rapidly growing Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD)framework2 reflects the distinct types of language data that already exist in LOD compliant formats,supporting their publication in the cloud and enabling their cross-linking and their linking to otherknowledge objects available in the LOD context.And to further stress the importance of this development, the main conference in the field of lan-guage resources, LREC, has declared the LOD as one of the hot topics of its 2014 edition3 and we canobserve from the list of accepted papers and workshops/tutorials that indeed this is really a hot topicfor the description of language resources.Some projects and initiatives have been very active in this field, and we want to mention here only afew, like the LOD2 project4, which released among others the NIF (NLP Interchange Format) 5 speci-fications, or the Monnet project6, which delivered the lemon model for the representation of lexical?This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

8.
Participants of those projects and many other researchers joined instandardization activities, mainly in the context of W3C, like the Ontolex community group9.We are also aware of works porting dialectal dictionaries (Wandl-Vogt and Declerck, 2013) or po-larity lexicons (Buitelaar et al., 2013) onto LOD compliant representation formalisms.
A benefit ofsuch approaches is the fact that lexical data can be linked to meanings encoded in knowledge sourcesthat are accessible via a URI, such as senses encoded in the DBpedia instantiation of Wiktioanry, andfrom there one can navigate to multilingual lexical equivalents, if those are available.As a concrete example, working on historical German text, we could link the old word form?Fegfeur?
(purgatory) via its modern German lemma ?Fegefeuer?
not only to a lexical sense in theDBpedia instantiation of Wiktionary: http://wiktionary.dbpedia.org/page/Fegefeuer-German-Noun-1de, also with access to 7 translations of this sense, but also leading to the DBpedia page for ?purgato-ry?, one get additional semantic information, so for example that the word is related to the categories?Christian_eschatology?, ?Christianity_and_death?
etc.10 And, in fact, the recent release of BabelNet2.5 is summarizing this information in one page11 for the reader, integrating information from Word-Net, Wiktionary and Wikipedia.
This example alone gives a very strong argument on why it is worthto encode language data using the same type of representation formalism as for knowledge objectsavailable in the Linked Data cloud.2 Representation Formalisms usedBased on the Resource Description Framework (RDF)12, SKOS (Simple Knowledge OrganizationSystem)13 ?provides a model for expressing the basic structure and content of concept schemes such asthesauri, classification schemes, subject heading lists, taxonomies, folksonomies, and other similartypes of controlled vocabulary.
?14 This representation language is being widely used, since SKOSconcepts can be (1) ?semantically related to each other in informal hierarchies and association net-works?, (2) ?the SKOS vocabulary itself can be extended to suit the needs of particular communitiesof practice?
and finally, because it (3) ?can also be seen as a bridging technology, providing the miss-ing link between the rigorous logical formalism of ontology languages such as OWL and the chaotic,informal and weakly-structured world of Web-based collaboration tools.
?15 With the use of SKOS (andRDF), we are also in the position to make language resources compatible with other language resourceavailable in the LOD cloud, as we could see with our examples above with the DBpedia instantiationof Wiktionary16 or the very recent release of BabelNet.
Since, contrary to most knowledge objectsdescribed in the LOD, we do not considers strings (encoding lemma and word forms as part of a lan-guage) as being just literals, but in also knowledge objects, we considered the use of SKOS-XL and ofthe lemon model, which was developed in the context of the Monnet project17.
lemon is also availableas an ontology18.3 A concrete Exercise with (German) polarity LexiconsInspired by (Buitelaar et al., 2013) we aimed at porting German polarity lexicons to a Linked Datacompliant format, and so publish our data directly in the cloud.
Our starting points are the followingresources:7 See http://lemon-model.net/8 See http://www.lider-project.eu/9 http://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Main_Page10 Details of this work is decribed in (Resch et al., 2014)11 See http://babelnet.org/search.jsp?word=Fegefeuer&lang=DE12 http://www.w3.org/RDF/13 http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/14 http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-skos-primer-20090818/15 Ibid.16 See http://dbpedia.org/Wiktionary.
There, lemon is also used for the description of certain lexical properties.17 See http://lemon-model.net/18 See http://www.monnet-project.eu/lemon19?

SentiWS22 (Remus et al., 2010)3.1 Pre-Processing of the lexical Data: HarmonizationAs the reader can imagine, all those resources were available in distinct formats and containing dis-tinct types of features.
Therefore, we first had first to define a pre-processing of the different lexicaldata for the purpose of their harmonisation.
This point leads us to a general remark: It is by far notenough to transform the representation of the lexical data onto RDF and related languages for ensuringtheir semantic interoperability in the LOD cloud, but preliminary work has to be performed.
Just togive an example of the outcome of this work, we present a harmonized entry in Figure 1 below:"fehler" => {             # lemma"prov::GermanPC.lex" => {      # provenance info"pos::N" => {      # PoS info"pol_rank" => "0.783019",    # ranking in the orginal source"pol_val" => "NEG",    # polarity feature in the orig souce},},"prov::GermanSentiSpin.lex" => {"pos::N" => {"pol_rank" => "0.0087112","pol_val" => "NEG",},},"prov::GermanSentiWS.lex" => {"pos::N" => {"pol_rank" => "0.6752","pol_val" => "NEG",},},"prov::german.lex" => {"pos::N" => {"pol_rank" => "0.7","pol_val" => "NEG",},},},Only on the base of this harmonized lexicon, we started to model the lexical resource for publicationon the LOD framework.
But before getting onto the presentation of the model, we should note that theharmonized lexicon also contributed to a reduction of the lexical data: instead of originally 4 (lemma)entries, we have now only one.19 Downloadable at http://sentimental.li/german.lex20 Downloadable at http://www.ulliwaltinger.de/sentiment/21 SentiSpin is originally an English resource (Takamura eta., 2005), tranlsated to German by (Waltinger, 2010b).22 Downloadable at http://asv.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/download/sentiws.htmlFigure 1: The harmonized entry ?fehler?
(error) .
The remaining differences in this polarity lexicon can beonly in the value of the features ?pos?, ?pol_val?
and ?pol_rank?.203.2 The LOD compliant Representation of the harmonized polarity LexiconOur work consisted in providing a representation of the lexical data using as much as possible infor-mation that is available in external resources, like the ISOcat registry23, and an ontological model forthe representation of polarity data, which is a slight extension of the MARL model, described in(Westerski et al., 2013).
In below, we just display an excerpt of the description of the entry ?fehler?

?As the reader can see, such representation can link the lexical information to a wide range of relatedinformation, and what in the context of former infrastructures for language resources was representedby a set of external metadata can be incorporated here directly in the choice of classes and properties.In fact, we do not need to encode the information that the entry has PoS Noun, since this informationis encoded in the details of the reference in Wiktionary/DBpedia we are pointing to.4 Some ?philosophical?
CommentsThe work we described briefly in this position paper, as well as work performed by researchers forporting for example dialectal dictionaries onto the LOD compliant formats (see Wandl-Vogt & De-clerck, 2013) show a real potential for publishing distinct types of lexical data in the cloud, and tomake this data accessible for both humans and machine in a very principled way.
As noted, the use ofcarefully selected (widely accepted) classes and properties in the representation of the lexical data canalso replace the use of complex metadata sets: parts of those metadata sets being implicitly encoded inthe semantic representation the lexical data.This positive aspect should not hide the fact that, at least in our opinion, the community is not think-ing enough in providing for harmonization of the original lexical data.
In many cases the data sets inthe Linguistic Linked Open Data are redundant, repeating for example many times the lemmas of lexi-cal entries in the different types of data set.
We think that similar to the ISOcat data category we couldaim at having a ?centralized?
repository for lemmas of one language, so that this lemma is not repeat-ed for example in Wiktionary, Lexvo24 and many other data sets in the LLOD.
We are wondering if, in23 See for example http://www.isocat.org/rest/dc/1333 for our selected ISOcat entry for the pos ?noun?.24 See http://www.lexvo.org/Figure 2: The RDF, SKOS-XL and lemon representation of the entry, with a link to an ontological framework represent-ing polarity information.
The various polarities given by the various sources are represented as ?OpinionObjects?.21the precise context of the LOD ?
linking lexical data to other data sets in the cloud ?
it would not bepossible to have exactly one lexical data set for reach language.
Figure 3 below sketches our intendedmodel, taking as example terminology in the field of financial reporting.Figure 3: An example instantiation of the model we are aiming at: a unique (lemma) lexicon for one language (bottom right).Getting the full forms from a repository of such forms, including feature structures describing their morpho-syntactic infor-mation.
Those are linking to occurrences of terms or labels that are used in knowledge objects (domain ontologies, taxono-mies etc.).
This model allows to precisely linking information from the lexicon, the morpho-syntactic descriptions and poten-tial grammatical patterns as those are used in labels, comments or definitions in the context of knowledge objects in the LODdata sets.
This model for representing lexical and linguistic data would be specialized for establishing linking between lan-guage data and representation of world knowledge.
We expect from this approach an improvement in fields like domain spe-cific machine translation and ontology-.based multilingual information extraction.5 ConclusionsIn this short position paper, we presented some experiences done in the context of the emerging Lin-guistic Linked Open Data framework.
This lead us to make some comments on the way we could gofor a much more ?compressed?
distribution of semantically (using LOD compliant representation lan-guages) encoded language data, which could be more easily re-used in the context of knowledge-basedNLP applications.
The result would be a set of language specific ?centralised?
repositories of lemmasand related full forms, all equipped with URIs, that are used in the context of knowledge objects pre-sent in the Linked Data framework.AcknowledgmentsThe research described in this paper is partly supported by the European Lider project.
