For Task-A, a CRFbased sequencing algorithm was used tofind different medical entities and a binarySVM classifier was used to find relation-ship between entities.
For Task-B, a dic-tionary look-up algorithm on a customizedUMLS-2012 dictionary was used to findrelative CUI for a given disorder mention.The system achieved F-score of 0.714 forTask A & accuracy of 0.599 for Task Bwhen trained only on training data set, andit achieved F-score of 0.755 for Task A &accuracy of 0.646 for Task B when trainedon both training as well as developmentdata set.
Our system was placed 3rd forboth task A and B.1 IntroductionA clinical document contains plethora of informa-tion regarding patient?s medical condition in un-structured format.
So a sophisticated NLP sys-tem built specifically for clinical domain can bevery useful in many different clinical applications.In recent years, clinical NLP has gained a lotof significance in research community because itcontains challenging tasks such as medical entityrecognition, abbreviation disambiguation, inter-conceptual relationship detection, anaphora res-olution, and text summarization.
Clinical NLPhas also gained a significant attraction among the1http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution4.0 International License.

This task was about findingdisorder mentions from the clinical text and as-sociating them with their related CUIs (conceptunique identifiers) as given in the UMLS (UnifiedMedical Language System).
UMLS is the largestavailable medical knowledge resource.
It contains2,885,877 different CUIs having 6,497,937 differ-ent medical terms from over 100 different medi-cal vocabularies.
Finding accurate CUIs from freeclinical text can be very helpful in many healthcareapplications.
Our aim for participating in this taskwas to explore new techniques of finding CUIsfrom clinical document.Over the last few years many different Clin-ical NLP systems like cTAKES (Savova, Guer-gana K., et al., 2010), MetaMap (A. Aronson,2001), MedLEE (C. Friedman et al., 1994) havebeen developed to extract medical concepts froma clinical document.
Most of these systems focuson rule based, medical knowledge driven dictio-nary look-up approaches.
In very recent past, afew attempts have been made to use supervised orsemi-supervised learning models.
In 2009, YefangWang (Wang et al., 2009) used cascading clas-sifiers on manually annotated data which fetchedF-score of 0.832.
In 2010, i2b2 shared task chal-lenge focused on finding test, treatment and prob-lem mentions from clinical document.In 2013, ShARe/CLEF task focused on findingdisorder mentions from clinical document and as-signing relevant CUI code to it.
In both i2b2 taskand ShaRe/CLEF task most of the systems usedeither supervised or semi-supervised learning ap-278proaches.In this paper we have proposed a hybrid super-vised learning approach based on CRF and SVMto find out disorder mentions from clinical doc-uments and a dictionary look-up approach on acustomized UMLS meta-thesaurus to find corre-sponding CUI.2 DataThe SemEval-2014 corpus comprises of de-identified plain text from MIMIC2version 2.5database.
A disorder mention was defined as anyspan of text which can be mapped to a conceptin UMLS and which belongs to the Disorder se-mantic group.
There were 431 notes extractedfrom intensive care unit having various clinicalreport types (like radiology, discharge summary,echocardiogram and ECG), out of which 99 noteswere used in development data set, 199 notes wereused in training data set and 133 notes were usedin testing data set.Preliminary analysis on this data showed thatnumber of sentences in training documents werecomparatively smaller than the development ortest data set (Table 1).
Number of disorder men-tions were also significantly lower in training dataset than in development data set (Table 1).Type Dev Train TestDocuemnts 99 199 133Sentence 9860 10485 17368Token 102k 113k 177kAvg token/sen 10.42 10.79 10.24Cont.

First a CRF based se-quencing model was used to find different disordermentions, modifiers, anatomical sites and findings.2http://mimic.physionet.org/database/releases/70-version-25.htmlThen a binary SVM classifier was used to checkif relationship exists between a disorder and othertypes of entities or not.Example DisorderFindingsAnatomyModifierThere is persistentleft lower lobe opacitypresumably atelectasis.3 3 7 7He had substernal chestpain, sharp but withoutradiation.3 3 7 7Patientt also developedsome erythema aroundthe stoma site onhospital day two.3 7 3 7The tricuspid valveleaflets are mildly thick-ened.7 3 3 7Please call,if you findswelling in the wound.3 3 7 7She also notes new sharppain in left shoulderblade/back area.3 7 3 7An echocardiogramdemonstrated mildleft and right atrialdilatation3 7 7 3Table 2: Entity Types co-relation and examplesFor Task-B, we have used a simple dictionarylook up algorithm on a customized UMLS dictio-nary.
A preliminary analysis of UMLS entities ingeneral show that a single disorder mention mayconsist of various types of linguistic phrases.
It isnot necesarry that the system to detect these enti-ties as a single phrase.
The entities and their re-lations may also occur in disjoint phrases as well.Our analysis of the disorder entities inside UMLSreveals that out of a total 278,859 disorders (basedon SNOMED-CT library), 96,069 are such thatcan be broken down into more than one phrase,which is roughly 1/3 of total number of disordersin the UMLS.3.1 System WorkflowThe Work-flow of the system is as follow:279Figure 1: System Workflow3.1.1 Pre-processingAll the clinical documents used in this taskwere de-identified.
So information related tohospital name, patient demographics, physiciannames/signatures, dates, places, and certain lab-data were converted into predefined patterns.These patterns were hindering the flow of natu-ral language.
As a result of it, we were unable toget accurate results for PoS tagging and chunkingof the sentences.
So we replaced all of these de-identified patterns with some text that appear moreas natural language.
There were also some head-ers and footers associated with all the documents,which were actually irrelevant to this task.
There-fore all headers and footers were also removed atthe pre-processing level.3.1.2 openNLPWe have used openNLP3to perform basic NLPtasks like sentence detection, tokenizing, PoS tag-ging, chunking, parsing and stemming.3.1.3 Dictionary LookupUMLS 2012AA dictionary with Lexical VariantGenerator (LVG)4was used to perform dictionarylookup task.
Even though the task was only aboutfinding disorder mentions, we also identified en-tities like procedures, finding, lab data, medicine,anatomical site and medical devices to be used asfeatures in our CRF model.
This was helpful indecreasing the number of false positive.
UMLSTUI (Type Unique Identifier) used for differententity type is described in Table 3.
A rule-basedapproach on the output of the OpenNLP syntac-tic parser was used to detect possible modifiers fordisorder mentions.Type Tui listDisorderT046,T047,T048,T049,T050,T191,T037,T019,T184AnatomicalSitesT017,T021,T023,T024,T025,T026,T029,T030Procedures T059,T060,T061Medicines T200,T120,T110Lab Data T196,T119Modifiers Customized DictionaryFindingsT033,T034,T041,T084,T032,T201,T053,T054Table 3: Entity Types and their related TUI listfrom UMLS3.1.4 CRF Feature GenerationThe feature sets were divided into three categories.1) Clinical Featuresi) Section Headers: A clinical note is often di-vided into relevant segments called Section Head-ers.
These section headers provide very usefulinformation at the discourse level.
Same sectionheader can have multiple variants.
For exampleHistory of Present Illness can also be written asHPI, HPIS, Brief History etc.
We have created adictionary of more than 550 different section head-ers and classified them into more than 40 hierar-chical categories.
But using only section headerdictionary for classification can fetch many false3https://opennlp.apache.org/4http://lexsrv2.nlm.nih.gov/280positives.
Section header always appears in a pre-defined similar sequences.
So to remove thesefalse positives, we have used a Hidden MarkovModel(HMM) (Parth Pathak, et al, 2013).
For thistask, we have used unigram section header id as afeature for all the tokens in CRF.ii) Dictionary Lookup: A binary feature wasused for all the different entity types detected fromUMLS dictionary from last pipeline.iii) Abbreviations: Abbreviations Disambigua-tion is one of the most challenging tasks in clinicalNLP.
The primary reason for the same is a lack ofdictionary which contains most of the valid list ofabbreviations.
For this task, we have used LRABRas base dictionary to find out all the possible ab-breviations and on top of that, a binary SVM clas-sifier was used to check if the given abbreviationhas medical sense or not.2) Textual Feature:Snowball stemmer5was used to find out stemvalue of all the word tokens.
Prefix and suffix oflength 2 to 5 were also used as features.
Differentorthographic features like whole word capital, firstchar capital, numeric values, dates, words contain-ing hyphen or slash, medical units (mg/gram/ltretc.)
were used as features.3) Syntactic Features:Different linguistic features like PoS tags andchunks for each token were used.
We have alsoused head of the noun phrase as one of the featurewhich can be very helpful in detecting the type ofan entity.3.1.5 CRF toolkitAll the annotated data was converted into BIOsequencing format.
CRF++6toolkit was used totrain and predict the model.3.1.6 SVMSVM was used to check whether a relationship ex-ists between two entities or not.
For this purposeall the tokens between these two entities, their partof speech tags and chunks were used as features.Rules based on output of a syntactic parser werealso used as a binary feature.
Some orthographicfeatures like all letter capital, contains colon (:),contains semi colon (;), were also used as features.LibSVM7was used to train as well as predict the5http://snowball.tartarus.org/6http://crfpp.googlecode.com/7http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/\?cjlin/libsvm/model.3.1.7 Dictionary Look-up for CUI detectionFor a better mapping of the entities detected byNLP inside the given input text, we found it tobe a better approach to divide the UMLS enti-ties into various phrases.
This was done semi-automatically by splitting the strings based onfunction words such as prepositions, particles andnon-nominal word classes such as verbs, adjec-tives and adverbs.
While most of the disorder enti-ties in UMLS can be contained into a single nounphrase (NP) there are also quite a few that containmultiple NPs related with prepositional phrases(PPs), verb phrases (VPs) and adjectival phrases(ADJPs).This task gave us a modified version of theUMLS disorder entities along with their CUIs.The following table (Table 4) gives a snapshotof what this customized UMLS dictionary lookedlike.CUI Text P1 P2 P3C0013132DribblingfrommouthDribbling from mouthC0014591Bleedingfrom noseBleeding from noseC0029163Hemorr-hage frommouthHemo-rrhagefrom mouthC0392685Chest painat restChest pain at restC0269678FatigueduringpregnancyFatigue duringpregnancyTable 4: An example of the modified UMLS disor-der entities split as per their linguistic phrase typesOur dictionary look-up algorithm used this cus-tomized UMLS dictionary as resource to find theentities and assign the right CUIs.4 Results & Error Analysis4.1 Evaluation CalculationsThe evaluation measures for Task A are Precision,Recall and F-Meas, defined as:Precision =TPFP+TPRecall =TPTP+FN281F-measure =2?Precision?RecallPrecision+RecallwhereTP = Disorder mention span matches with goldstandardFP = Disorder mention span detected by thesystem was not present in the gold standard;FN = Disorder mention span was present in thegold standard but system was not able detect itIn Task B, the Accuracy was defined as thenumber of pre-annotated spans with correctlygenerated code divided by the total number ofpre-annotated spans.Strict Accuracy =Total correct CUIsTotal annotation in gold standardRelaxed Accuracy =Total correct CUIsTotal span detected by system4.2 System AccuracyThe system results were calculated on two dif-ferent runs.
For the first evaluation, only trainingdata was used for the training purpose while forthe second evaluation, both the training as well asthe development data sets were used for trainingpurpose.
The results for Task A and B are asfollows:Precision Recall F-MeasStrict(T)0.750 0.682 0.714Relaxed(T)0.915 0.827 0.869Strict(T+D)0.770 0.740 0.755Relaxed(T+D)0.911 0.887 0.899Table 5: Task-A Resultswhere T= Training Data setD= Development Data set4.3 Error AnalysisError Analysis on training data revealed that forTask-A our system got poor results in detectingnon-contiguous disjoint entities.
Our system alsoperformed very poorly in identifying abbrevia-tions and misspelled entities.
We also observedAccuracyStrict(T)0.599Relaxed(T)0.878Strict(T+D)0.643Relaxed(T+D) 0.868Table 6: Task-B Resultsthat the accuracy of the part of speech tagger andthe chunker also contributes a lot towards the finaloutcome.
For Task-B, we got many false positives.Many CUIs which we identified from the UMLSwere not actually annotated.5 ConclusionIn this paper we have proposed a CRF and SVMbased hybrid approach to find Disorder mentionsfrom a given clinical text and a novel dictio-nary look-up approach for discovering CUIs fromUMLS meta-thesaurus.
Our system did producecompetitive results and was third best among theparticipants of this task.
In future, we would liketo explore semi-supervised learning approaches totake advantage of large amount of available un-annotated free clinical text.ReferencesSavova, Guergana K., James J. Masanz, Philip V.Ogren, Jiaping Zheng, Sunghwan Sohn, Karin C.Kipper-Schuler, and Christopher G. Chute.
