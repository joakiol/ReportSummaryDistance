The de-veloped @AM system relies on compositio-nality principle and a novel approach based onthe rules elaborated for semantically distinctverb classes.
The evaluation of our method on1000 sentences, that describe personal expe-riences, showed promising results: averageaccuracy on fine-grained level was 62%, onmiddle level ?
71%, and on top level ?
88%.1 Introduction and Related WorkWith rapidly growing online sources aimed at en-couraging and stimulating people?s discussionsconcerning personal, public or social issues (news,blogs, discussion forums, etc.
), there is a greatneed in development of a computational tool forthe analysis of people?s attitudes.
According to theAppraisal Theory (Martin and White, 2005), atti-tude types define the specifics of appraisal beingexpressed: affect (personal emotional state), judg-ment (social or ethical appraisal of other?s behav-iour), and appreciation (evaluation of phenomena).To analyse contextual sentiment (polarity) of aphrase or a sentence, rule-based approaches (Na-sukawa and Yi, 2003; Mulder et al, 2004; Moila-nen and Pulman, 2007; Subrahmanian andReforgiato, 2008), a machine-learning method us-ing not only lexical but also syntactic features(Wilson et al, 2005), and a model of integration ofmachine learning approach with compositionalsemantics (Choi and Cardie, 2008) were proposed.With the aim to recognize fine-grained emotionsfrom text on the level of distinct sentences, re-searchers have employed a keyword spotting tech-nique (Olveres et al, 1998; Chuang and Wu, 2004;Strapparava et al, 2007), a technique calculatingemotion scores using Pointwise Mutual Informa-tion (PMI) (Kozareva et al, 2007), an approachinspired by common-sense knowledge (Liu et al,2003), rule-based linguistic approaches (Boucou-valas, 2003; Chaumartin, 2007), machine-learningmethods (Alm, 2008; Aman and Szpakowicz,2008; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008), and anensemble based multi-label classification technique(Bhowmick et al, 2009).Early attempts to focus on distinct attitude typesin the task of attitude analysis were made by Ta-boada and Grieve (2004), who determined a poten-tial value of adjectives for affect, judgement andappreciation by calculating the PMI with the pro-noun-copular pairs ?I was (affect)?, ?He was(judgement)?, and ?It was (appreciation)?, andWhitelaw et al (2005), who used machine learningtechnique (SVM) with fine-grained semantic dis-tinctions in features (attitude type, orientation) incombination with ?bag of words?
to classify moviereviews.
However, the concentration only on ad-jectives, that express appraisal, and their modifiers,greatly narrows the potential of the Whitelaw etal.
?s (2005) approach.In this paper we introduce our system @AM(ATtitude Analysis Model), which (1) classifies80sentences according to the fine-grained attitudelabels (nine affect categories (Izard, 1971): ?anger?,?disgust?, ?fear?, ?guilt?, ?interest?, ?joy?, ?sadness?,?shame?, ?surprise?
; four polarity labels for judg-ment and appreciation: ?POS jud?, ?NEG jud?,?POS app?, ?NEG app?
; and ?neutral?
); (2) assignsthe strength of the attitude; and (3) determines thelevel of confidence, with which the attitude is ex-pressed.
@AM relies on compositionality principleand a novel approach based on the rules elaboratedfor semantically distinct verb classes.2 Lexicon for Attitide AnalysisWe built the lexicon for attitude analysis that in-cludes: (1) attitude-conveying terms; (2) modifiers;(3) ?functional?
words; and (4) modal operators.2.1 The Core of LexiconAs a core of lexicon for attitude analysis, we em-ploy Affect database and extended version of Sen-tiFul database developed by Neviarouskaya et al(2009).
The affective features of each emotion-related word are encoded using nine emotion labels(?anger?, ?disgust?, ?fear?, ?guilt?, ?interest?, ?joy?,?sadness?, ?shame?, and ?surprise?)
and correspond-ing emotion intensities that range from 0.0 to 1.0.The original version of SentiFul database, whichcontains sentiment-conveying adjectives, adverbs,nouns, and verbs annotated by sentiment polarity,polarity scores and weights, was manually ex-tended using attitude labels.
Some examples ofannotated attitude-conveying words are listed inTable 1.
It is important to note here that somewords could express different attitude types (affect,judgment, appreciation) depending on context;such lexical entries were annotated by all possiblecategories.POS Word Category Intensityadjective honorableunfriendlyPOS judNEG aff (sadness)NEG judNEG app0.30.50.50.5adverb gleefully POS aff (joy) 0.9noun abnormality NEG app 0.25verb frightendesireNEG aff (fear)POS aff (interest)POS aff (joy)0.81.00.5Table 1.
Examples of attitude-conveying words andtheir annotations.2.2 Modifiers and Functional WordsThe robust attitude analysis method should rely notonly on attitude-conveying terms, but also on mod-ifiers and contextual valence shifters (term intro-duced by Polanyi and Zaenen (2004)), which areintegral parts of our lexicon.We collected 138 modifiers that have an impacton contextual attitude features of related words,phrases, or clauses.
They include:1.
Adverbs of degree (e.g., ?significantly?,?slightly?
etc.)
and adverbs of affirmation (e.g.,?absolutely?, ?seemingly?)
that have an influence onthe strength of attitude of the related words.2.
Negation words (e.g., ?never?, ?nothing?etc.)
that reverse the polarity of related statement.3.
Adverbs of doubt (e.g., ?scarcely?, ?hardly?etc.)
and adverbs of falseness (e.g., ?wrongly?
etc.
)that reverse the polarity of related statement.4.
Prepositions (e.g., ?without?, ?despite?
etc.
)that neutralize the attitude of related words.5.
Condition operators (e.g., ?if?, ?even though?etc.)
that neutralize the attitude of related words.Adverbs of degree and adverbs of affirmation af-fect on related verbs, adjectives, or another adverb.Two annotators gave coefficients for intensity de-gree strengthening or weakening (from 0.0 to 2.0)to each of 112 collected adverbs, and the result wasaveraged (e.g., coeff(?perfectly?)
= 1.9,coeff(?slightly?)
= 0.2).We distinguish two types of ?functional?
wordsthat influence contextual attitude and its strength:1.
Intensifying adjectives (e.g., ?rising?, ?rap-idly-growing?
), nouns (e.g., ?increase?, ?up-tick?
),and verbs (e.g., ?to grow?, ?to rocket?
), which in-crease the strength of attitude of related words.2.
Reversing adjectives (e.g., ?reduced?
), nouns(e.g., ?termination?, ?reduction?
), and verbs (e.g.,?to decrease?, ?to limit?, ?to diminish?
), which re-verse the prior polarity of related words.2.3 Modal OperatorsConsideration of the modal operators in the tasksof opinion mining and attitude analysis is very im-portant, as they indicate a degree of person?s beliefin the truth of the proposition, which is subjectivein nature.
Modal expressions point to likelihoodand clearly involve the speaker?s judgment (Hoye,1997).
Modals are distinguished by the confidencelevel.81We collected modal operators of two categories:1.
Modal verbs (13 verbs).2.
Modal adverbs (61 adverbs).Three human annotators assigned the confidencelevel, which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, to each modalverb and adverb; these ratings were averaged (e.g.,conf(?vaguely?)
= 0.17, conf(?may?)
= 0.27,conf(?arguably?)
= 0.63, conf(?would?)
= 0.8,conf(?veritably?)
= 1.0).3 Compositionality PrincipleWords in a sentence are interrelated and, hence,each of them can influence the overall meaningand attitudinal bias of a statement.
The algorithmfor the attitude classification is designed based onthe compositionality principle, according to whichwe determine the attitudinal meaning of a sentenceby composing the pieces that correspond to lexicalunits or other linguistic constituent types governedby the rules of polarity reversal, aggregation (fu-sion), propagation, domination, neutralization, andintensification, at various grammatical levels.Polarity reversal means that phrase or statementcontaining attitude-conveying term/phrase withprior positive polarity becomes negative, and viceversa.
The rule of polarity reversal is applied inthree cases: (1) negation word-modifier in relationwith attitude-conveying statement (e.g., ?never?
&POS(?succeed?)
=> NEG(?never succeed?
)); (2)adverb of doubt in relation with attitude-conveyingstatement (e.g., ?scarcely?
& POS(?relax?)
=>NEG(?scarcely relax?
)); (3) functional word ofreversing type in relation with attitude-conveyingstatement (e.g., adjective ?reduced?
&POS(?enthusiasm?)
=> NEG(?reduced enthusi-asm?)).
In the case of judgment and appreciation,the use of polarity reversal rule is straightforward(?POS jud?
<=> ?NEG jud?, ?POS app?
<=> ?NEGapp?).
However, it is not trivial to find pairs of op-posite emotions in the case of a fine-grained classi-fication, except for ?joy?
and ?sadness?.
Therefore,we assume that (1) opposite emotion for three posi-tive emotions, such as ?interest?, ?joy?, and ?sur-prise?, is ?sadness?
(?POS aff?
=> ?sadness?
); and(2) opposite emotion for six negative emotions,such as ?anger?, ?disgust?, ?fear?, ?guilt?, ?sadness?,and ?shame?, is ?joy?
(?NEG aff?
=> ?joy?
).The rules of aggregation (fusion) are as follows:(1) if polarities of attitude-conveying terms in ad-jective-noun, noun-noun, adverb-adjective, adverb-verb phrases have opposite directions, mixed po-larity with dominant polarity of a descriptive termis assigned to the phrase (e.g., POS(?beautiful?)
&NEG(?fight?)
=> POS-neg(?beautiful fight?);NEG(?shamelessly?)
& POS(?celebrate?)
=> NEG-pos(?shamelessly celebrate?
)); otherwise (2) theresulting polarity is based on the equal polarities ofterms, and the strength of attitude is measured as amaximum between polarity scores (intensities) ofterms (max(score1,score2)).The rule of propagation is useful, as proposed in(Nasukawa and Yi, 2003), for the task of detectionof local sentiments for given subjects.
?Propaga-tion?
verbs propagate the sentiment towards thearguments; ?transfer?
verbs transmit sentimentsamong the arguments.
The rule of propagation isapplied when verb of ?propagation?
or ?transfer?type is used in a phrase/clause and sentiment of anargument that has prior neutral polarity needs to beinvestigated (e.g., PROP-POS(?to admire?)
& ?hisbehaviour?
=> POS(?his behaviour?
); ?Mr.
X?
&TRANS(?supports?)
& NEG(?crime business?)
=>NEG(?Mr.
X?
)).The rules of domination are as follows: (1) if po-larities of verb (this rule is applied only for certainclasses of verbs) and object in a clause have oppo-site directions, the polarity of verb is prevailing(e.g., NEG(?to deceive?)
& POS(?hopes?)
=>NEG(?to deceive hopes?
)); (2) if compound sen-tence joints clauses using coordinate connector?but?, the attitude features of a clause followingafter the connector are dominant (e.g., ?NEG(Itwas hard to climb a mountain all night long), butPOS(a magnificent view rewarded the traveler atthe morning).?
=> POS(whole sentence)).The rule of neutralization is applied whenpreposition-modifier or condition operator relate tothe attitude-conveying statement (e.g., ?despite?
&NEG(?worries?)
=> NEUT(?despite worries?
)).The rule of intensification means strengtheningor weakening of the polarity score (intensity), andis applied when:1. adverb of degree or affirmation relates to at-titude-conveying term (e.g., Pos_score(?extremelyhappy?)
> Pos_score(?happy?));2.
adjective or adverb is used in a comparativeor superlative form (e.g., Neg_score(?sad?)
<Neg_score(?sadder?)
< Neg_score (?saddest?
)).Our method is capable of processing sentences ofdifferent complexity, including simple, compound,complex (with complement and relative clauses),82and complex-compound sentences.
To understandhow words and concepts relate to each other in asentence, we employ Connexor Machinese Syntaxparser (http://www.connexor.eu/) thatreturns lemmas, parts of speech, dependency func-tions, syntactic function tags, and morphologicaltags.
When handling the parser output, we repre-sent the sentence as a set of primitive clauses.
Eachclause might include Subject formation, Verb for-mation and Object formation, each of which mayconsist of a main element (subject, verb, or object)and its attributives and complements.
For theprocessing of complex or compound sentences, webuild a so-called ?relation matrix?, which containsinformation about dependences (e.g., coordination,subordination, condition, contingency, etc.)
be-tween different clauses in a sentence.The annotations of words are taken from our at-titude-conveying lexicon.
The decision on mostappropriate label, in case of words with multipleannotations (e.g., word ?unfriendly?
in Table 1), ismade based on (1) the analysis of morphologicaltags of nominal heads and their premodifiers in thesentence (e.g., first person pronoun, third personpronoun, demonstrative pronoun, nominative orgenitive noun, etc.
); (2) the analysis of the se-quence of hypernymic semantic relations of a par-ticular noun in WordNet (Miller, 1990), whichallows to determine its conceptual domain (e.g.,?person, human being?, ?artifact?, ?event?, etc.
).For ex., ?I feel highly unfriendly attitude towardsme?
conveys ?NEG aff?
(?sadness?
), while ?Shopassistant?s behavior was really unfriendly?
and?Plastic bags are environment unfriendly?
express?NEG jud?
and ?NEG app?, correspondingly.While applying the compositionality principle,we consecutively assign attitude features to words,phrases, formations, clauses, and finally, to thewhole sentence.4 Consideration of the Semantics of VerbsAll sentences must include a verb, because theverb tells us what action the subject is performingand object is receiving.
In order to elaborate rulesfor attitude analysis based on the semantics ofverbs, we investigated VerbNet (Kipper et al,2007), the largest on-line verb lexicon that is orga-nized into verb classes characterized by syntacticand semantic coherence among members of aclass.
Based on the thorough analysis of 270 first-level classes of VerbNet and their members, 73verb classes (1) were found useful for the task ofattitude analysis, and (2) were further classifiedinto 22 classes differentiated by the role that mem-bers play in attitude analysis and by rules appliedto them.
Our classification is shown in Table 2.Verb class (verb samples)1 Psychological state or emotional reaction1.1 Object-centered (oriented) emotional state (adore, re-gret)1.2 Subject-driven change in emotional state (trans.
)(charm, inspire, bother)1.3 Subject-driven change in emotional state (intrans.)
(ap-peal to, grate on)2 Judgment2.1 Positive judgment (bless, honor)2.2 Negative judgment (blame, punish)3 Favorable attitude (accept, allow, tolerate)4 Adverse (unfavorable) attitude (discourage, elude, forbid)5 Favorable or adverse calibratable changes of state (grow,decline)6 Verbs of removing6.1 Verbs of removing with neutral charge (delete, remove)6.2 Verbs of removing with negative charge (deport, expel)6.3 Verbs of removing with positive charge (evacuate,cure)7 Negatively charged change of state (break, crush, smash)8 Bodily state and damage to the body (sicken, injure)9 Aspectual verbs9.1 Initiation, continuation of activity, and sustaining (be-gin, continue, maintain)9.2 Termination of activity (quit, finish)10 Preservation (defend, insure)11 Verbs of destruction and killing (damage, poison)12 Disappearance (disappear, die)13 Limitation and subjugation (confine, restrict)14 Assistance (succor, help)15 Obtaining (win, earn)16 Communication indicator/reinforcement of attitude (guess,complain, deny)17 Verbs of leaving (abandon, desert)18 Changes in social status or condition (canonize, widow)19 Success and failure19.1 Success (succeed, manage)19.2 Failure (fail, flub)20 Emotional nonverbal expression (smile, weep)21 Social interaction (marry, divorce)22 Transmitting verbs (supply, provide)Table 2.
Verb classes defined for attitude analysis.For each of our verb classes, we developed setof rules that are applied to attitude analysis on thephrase/clause-level.
Some verb classes includeverbs annotated by attitude type, prior polarityorientation, and the strength of attitude: ?Psycho-logical state or emotional reaction?, ?Judgment?,?Verbs of removing with negative charge?, ?Verbs83of removing with positive charge?, ?Negativelycharged change of state?, ?Bodily state and dam-age to the body?, ?Preservation?, and others.
Theattitude features of phrases, which involve posi-tively or negatively charged verbs from suchclasses, are context-sensitive, and are defined bymeans of rules designed for each of the class.As an example, below we provide short descrip-tion and rules elaborated for the subclass ?Object-centered (oriented) emotional state?.Features: subject experiences emotions towardssome stimulus; verb prior polarity: positive or neg-ative; context-sensitive.Verb-Object rules (subject is ignored):1.
?Interior perspective?
(subject?s inner emotionstate or attitude):S & V+(?admires?)
& O+(?his brave heart?)
=>(fusion, max(V_score,O_score)) => ?POS aff?.S & V+(?admires?)
& O-(?mafia leader?)
=>(verb valence dominance, V_score) => ?POS aff?.S & V-(?disdains?)
& O+(?his honesty?)
=>(verb valence dominance, V_score) => ?NEG aff?.S & V-(?disdains?)
& O-(?criminal activities?
)=> (fusion, max(V_score,O_score)) => ?NEG aff?.2.
?Exterior perspective?
(social/ethical judgment):S & V+(?admires?)
& O+(?his brave heart?)
=>(fusion, max(V_score,O_score)) => ?POS jud?.S & V+(?admires?)
& O-(?mafia leader?)
=>(verb valence reversal, max(V_score,O_score)) =>?NEG jud?.S & V-(?disdains?)
& O+(?his honesty?)
=>(verb valence dominance, max(V_score,O_score))=> ?NEG jud?.S & V-(?disdains?)
& O-(?criminal activities?
)=> (verb valence reversal, max(V_score,O_score))=> ?POS jud?.3.
In case of neutral object => attitude type andprior polarity of verb, verb score (V_score).Verb-PP (prepositional phrase) rules:1.
In case of negatively charged verb and PP start-ing with ?from?
=> verb valence dominance:S & V-(?suffers?)
& PP-(?from illness?)
=> inte-rior: ?NEG aff?
; exterior: ?NEG jud?.S & V-(?suffers?)
& PP+ (?from love?)
=> inte-rior: ?NEG aff?
; exterior: ?NEG jud?.2.
In case of positively charged verb and PP start-ing with ?in?/?for?, treat PP same as object (seeabove):S & V+(?believes?)
& PP-(?in evil?)
=> interior:?POS aff?
; exterior: ?NEG jud?.S & V+(?believes?)
& PP+(?in kindness?)
=> in-terior: ?POS aff?
; exterior: ?POS jud?.In the majority of rules the strength of attitude ismeasured as a maximum between attitude scores ofa verb and an object (max(V_score,O_score)), be-cause strength of overall attitude depends on bothscores.
For example, attitude conveyed by ?to suf-fer from grave illness?
is stronger than that of ?tosuffer from slight illness?.In contrast to the rules of ?Object-centered(oriented) emotional state?
subclass, which ignoreattitude features of a subject in a sentence, the ruleselaborated for the ?Subject-driven change in emo-tional state (trans.)?
disregard the attitude featuresof object, as in sentences involving members ofthis subclass object experiences emotion, and sub-ject causes the emotional state.
For example (dueto limitation of space, here and below we provideonly some cases):S(?Classical music?)
& V+(?calmed?)
& O-(?disobedient child?)
=> interior: ?POS aff?
; exte-rior: ?POS app?.S-(?Fatal consequences of GM food intake?)
&V-(?frighten?)
& O(?me?)
=> interior: ?NEG aff?
;exterior: ?NEG app?.The Verb-Object rules for the subclasses ?Positivejudgment?
and ?Negative judgment?
(verbs from?Judgment?
class relate to a judgment or opinionthat someone may have in reaction to something)are very close to those defined for the subclass?Object-centered (oriented) emotional state?.However, Verb-PP rules have some specifics: forboth positive and negative judgment verbs, wetreat PP starting with ?for?/?of?/?as?
same as objectin Verb-Object rules.
For example:S(?He?)
& V-(?blamed?)
& O+(?innocent per-son?)
=> interior: ?NEG jud?
; exterior: ?NEG jud?.S(?They?)
& V-(?punished?)
& O(?him?)
& PP-(?for his misdeed?)
=> interior: ?NEG jud?
; exte-rior: ?POS jud?.Verbs from classes ?Favorable attitude?
and ?Ad-verse (unfavorable) attitude?
have prior neutralpolarity and positive or negative reinforcement,correspondingly, that means that they only impacton the polarity and strength of non-neutral phrase(object in a sentence written in active voice, orsubject in a sentence written in passive voice, orPP in case of some verbs).Rules:1.
If verb belongs to the ?Favorable attitude?
classand the polarity of phrase is not neutral, then the84attitude score of the phrase is intensified (we usesymbol ?^?
to indicate intensification):S(?They?)
& [V pos.
reinforcement](?elected?)
&O+(?fair judge?)
=> ?POS app?
; O_score^.S(?They?)
& [V pos.
reinforcement](?elected?)
&O-(?corrupt candidate?)
=> ?NEG app?
; O_score^.2.
If verb belongs to the ?Adverse (unfavorable)attitude?
class and the polarity of phrase is not neu-tral, then the polarity of phrase is reversed andscore is intensified:S(?They?)
& [V neg.
reinforcement](?prevented?
)& O-(?the spread of disease?)
=> ?POS app?
;O_score^.S+(?His achievements?)
& [V neg.
reinforce-ment](?were overstated?)
=> ?NEG app?
; S_score^.Below are examples of processing the sentenceswith verbs from ?Verbs of removing?
class.
?Verbs of removing with neutral charge?
:S(?The tape-recorder?)
& [V neutralrem.
](?automatically ejects?)
& O-neutral(?thetape?)
=> neutral.S(?The safety invention?)
& [V neutralrem.](?ejected?)
& O(?the pilot?)
& PP-(?fromburning plane?)
=> ?POS app?
; PP_score^.
?Verbs of removing with negative charge?:S(?Manager?)
& [V neg.
rem.](?fired?)
& O-(?careless employee?)
& PP(?from the company?
)=> ?POS app?
; max(V_score,O_score).
?Verbs of removing with positive charge?:S(?They?)
& [V pos.
rem.](?evacuated?)
&O(?children?)
& PP-(?from dangerous place?)
=>?POS app?
; max(V_score,PP_score).Along with modal verbs and modal adverbs, mem-bers of the ?Communication indica-tor/reinforcement of attitude?
verb class alsoindicate the confidence level or degree of certaintyconcerning given opinion.Features: subject (communicator) expresses state-ment with/without attitude; statement is PP startingwith ?of?, ?on?, ?against?, ?about?, ?concerning?,?regarding?, ?that?, ?how?
etc.
; ground: positive ornegative; reinforcement: positive or negative.Rules:1.
If the polarity of expressed statement is neutral,then the attitude is neutral:S(?Professor?)
& [V pos.
ground, pos.
rein-forcement, confidence:0.83](?dwelled?)
& PP-neutral(?on a question?)
=> neutral.2.
If the polarity of expressed statement is not neu-tral and the reinforcement is positive, then the po-larity score of the statement (PP) is intensified:S(?Jane?)
& [V neg.
ground, pos.
reinforcement,confidence:0.8](?is complaining?)
& PP-(?of aheadache again?)
=> ?NEG app?
; PP_score^; con-fidence:0.8.3.
If the polarity of expressed statement is not neu-tral and reinforcement is negative, then the polarityof the statement (PP) is reversed and score is inten-sified:S(?Max?)
& [V neg.
ground, neg.
reinforcement,confidence:0.2](?doubt?)
& PP-{?that?
S+(?hisgood fortune?)
& [V termination](?will ever end?
)}=> ?POS app?
; PP_score^; confidence:0.2.In the last example, to measure the sentiment ofPP, we apply rule for the verb ?end?
from the?Termination of activity?
class, which reverses thenon-neutral polarity of subject (in intransitive useof verb) or object (in transitive use of verb).
Forexample, the polarity of the following sentencewith positive PP is negative: ?They discontinuedhelping children?.5 EvaluationIn order to evaluate the performance of our algo-rithm, we conducted experiment on the set of sen-tences extracted from personal stories about lifeexperiences that were anonymously published onthe social networking website Experience Project(www.experienceproject.com).
This web-site represents an interactive platform that allowspeople to share personal experiences, thoughts,opinions, feelings, passions, and confessionsthrough the network of personal stories.
With over4 million experiences accumulated (as of February2010), Experience Project is a perfect source forresearchers interested in studying different types ofattitude expressed through text.5.1 Data Set DescriptionFor our experiment we extracted 1000 sentencesfrom various stories grouped by topics within 13different categories, such as ?Arts and entertain-ment?, ?Current events?, ?Education?, ?Family andfriends?, ?Health and wellness?, ?Relationshipsand romance?
and others, on the ExperienceProject.
Sentences were collected from 358 dis-tinct topic groups, such as ?I still remember Sep-tember 11?, ?I am intelligent but airheaded?, ?Ithink bullfighting is cruel?, ?I quit smoking?, ?I ama fashion victim?, ?I was adopted?
and others.85We considered three hierarchical levels of atti-tude labels in our experiment (see Figure 1).
Threeindependent annotators labeled the sentences withone of 14 categories from ALL level and a corres-ponding score (the strength or intensity value).These annotations were further interpreted usinglabels from MID and TOP levels.
Fleiss?
Kappacoefficient was used as a measure of reliability ofhuman raters?
annotations.
The agreement coeffi-cient on 1000 sentences was 0.53 on ALL level,0.57 on MID level, and 0.73 on TOP level.Only those sentences, on which at least two outof three human raters completely agreed, were in-cluded in the ?gold standard?
for our experiment.Three ?gold standards?
were created according tothe hierarchy of attitude labels.
Fleiss?
Kappa coef-ficients are 0.62, 0.63, and 0.74 on ALL, MID, andTOP levels, correspondingly.

The results are shownin Table 4.
The ratio of the most frequent attitudelabel in the ?gold standard?
was considered as thebaseline.
As seen from the obtained results, ouralgorithm performed with high accuracy signifi-cantly surpassing the baselines on all levels of atti-tude hierarchy (except ?neutral?

The algo-rithm performed with the worst results inrecognition of ?NEG app?
and ?neutral?.The analysis of a confusion matrix for the ALLlevel revealed the following top confusions of oursystem (see Table 5): (1) ?anger?, ?fear?, ?guilt?,?shame?, ?NEG jud?, ?NEG app?
and ?neutral?
werepredominantly incorrectly predicted as ?sadness?
(for ex., @AM resulted in ?sadness?
for the sen-tence ?I know we have several months left beforethe election, but I am already sick and tired of see-ing the ads on TV?, while human annotations were?anger?/?anger?/?disgust?
); (2) ?interest?, ?POS jud?and ?POS app?
were mostly confused with ?joy?
byour algorithm (e.g., @AM classified the sentence?It?s one of those life changing artifacts that wemust have in order to have happier, healthier lives?as ?joy?
(-ful), while human annotations were ?POSapp?/?POS app?/?interest?
).ActuallabelIncorrectly predicted labels (%), in descendingorderanger sadness (28.9%), joy (4.4%), neutral (4.4%),NEG app (2.2%)disgust anger (4.8%), sadness (4.8%), NEG jud (4.8%)fear sadness (13%), joy (5.6%), POS app (1.9%)guilt sadness (50%), anger (4.5%)interest joy (33.3%), neutral (7.1%), sadness (3.6%), POSapp (2.4%), fear (1.2%)joy interest (3.2%), POS app (3.2%), sadness (1.1%),surprise (1.1%), neutral (1.1%)sadness neutral (3.8%), joy (1.5%), anger (0.8%), fear(0.8%), guilt (0.8%), NEG app (0.8%)shame sadness (16.7%), fear (5.6%), guilt (5.6%), NEGjud (5.6%)surprise fear (5.6%), neutral (5.6%), joy (2.8%), POS jud(2.8%)POS jud joy (37.9%), POS app (9.1%), interest (4.5%),sadness (1.5%), surprise (1.5%), NEG jud(1.5%), neutral (1.5%)NEG jud sadness (37.2%), anger (3.8%), disgust (3.8%),neutral (3.8%)POS app joy (37%), neutral (9%), surprise (7%), interest(3%), POS jud (3%), sadness (1%)NEG app sadness (44.8%), fear (13.8%), disgust (3.4%),surprise (3.4%), neutral (3.4%)neutral sadness (29.9%), joy (13.8%), interest (3.4%),fear (2.3%), POS jud (2.3%), NEG app (2.3%),NEG jud (1.1%), POS app (1.1%)Table 5.
Data from a confusion matrix for ALL level.Our system achieved high precision for all cate-gories on the MID level (Table 4), with the excep-tion of ?NEG app?
and ?neutral?, although highrecall was obtained only in the case of categoriesrelated to affect (?POS aff?, ?NEG aff?).
These re-sults indicate that affect sensing is easier than rec-ognition of judgment or appreciation from text.TOP level results (Table 4) show that our algo-rithm classifies sentences that convey positive ornegative sentiment with high accuracy (92% and91%, correspondingly).
On the other hand, ?neu-tral?
sentences still pose a challenge.The analysis of errors revealed that system re-quires common sense or additional context to dealwith sentences like ?All through my life I?ve feltlike I?m second fiddle?
(?gold standard?
: ?sadness?
;@AM: ?neutral?)
or ?For me every minute on myhorse is alike an hour in heaven!?
(?gold stan-dard?
: ?joy?
; @AM: ?neutral?
).We also evaluated the system performance withregard to attitude intensity estimation.
The percen-tage of attitude-conveying sentences (not consider-ing neutral ones), on which the result of our systemconformed to the fine-grained ?gold standard?

As seen from the table, our sys-tem achieved satisfactory results in estimation ofthe strength of attitude expressed through text.Range of intensitydifferencePercent ofsentences, %[0.0 ?

Results on intensity.6 ConclusionsIn this paper we introduced @AM, which is so far,to the best of our knowledge, the only system clas-sifying sentences using fine-grained attitude types,and extensively dealing with the semantics ofverbs in attitude analysis.
Our composition ap-proach broadens the coverage of sentences withcomplex contextual attitude.
The evaluation resultsindicate that @AM achieved reliable results in thetask of textual attitude analysis.
The limitationsinclude dependency on lexicon and on accuracy ofthe parser.
The primary objective for the futureresearch is to use the results of named-entity rec-ognition software in our algorithm.87ReferencesCecilia O. Alm.
