CC~fl~TER-PRODUCED REPRES~EATION OF DIALECTAL VARIATION:INITIAL FRICATIVES IN SOUTHERN BRITISH ~GLISHW.
Nelson Francis, Jan Svartvik, and Gerald M. RublnDepartment of  L ingu is t i cs ,  Brown Un ivers i tyI t  has  become apparent  to  some d ia lec to lo6 is ts  that  d i~ lecto l -ogy, particularly in its interpretive phase, is a branch of linguis-tics particularly adapted to the use of computers.
The dialectol0-gist typically deals with large bodies of data, usually in the formof single words and short phrases, and he is interested in sortingand comparing individual items on many bases: phonological, morpho-logical, lexlcal, and geographical.
The major obstacle that hasprevented widespread use of computers in dialect study is the factthat the data for most of the great dialect surveys have been collec-I ted, recorded, and in most cases edited prior to the computer age.Thus the problem of preparing large bodies of data, much of it innarrow phonetic transcription, for computer use  has been formidable.One of the aims of the present paper is to show that results can beobtained relatively easily by computerized sorting and mapping thatwould take endless hours by traditional methods, and hopefully toencourage others to invest time and money in preparing data for thecomputer rather than in time-cc~suming hand sorting and map-making.Accordingly we sought a proble~ I that would be canplex enough toreveal the advantages of computerized dialectolo~y while at the same2t ime invo lv ing  a body of  data  smal l  enough %0 be qu ick ly  prepared .S ince  two o f  the  three ,authors  are  spec ia l i s ts  in  Eng l i sh  ( the  th i rdi s  a computer spec ia l i s t ) ,  we ~tura l /y  ~urned to  the  pub l i shedvolumes o f  the  5 'u~e~ d o f  ~dZ '~h D~a/~c~,  2 which embody care fu l lycont ro l led  data ,  co l lec ted  w i th  pro fess iona l  sk i l l ,  and presented  inconven ient  tabu lar  form in  met icu lous ly  ed i ted  and pr in ted  volumes.And s ince  une o f  the  two areas  coveredby the  volumes in  pr in t  a t  thetime the study was ~adertaken (May 1969) was the south of England,the problem of the voicing of initial fricatives in the southwestnaturally suggested itself.
This lyrohlem had the further advs~tage,for our purposes, of dea//ng with cm~sonants (s inkier than vowels inmost varieties of English) in /D/tial position, hence easily sortedand exsmined.
The selection of this proble~ has proved to be ahappy one.The area  covered by Volume ~ of  SED compr ises the  ten  southern -most count ies  of  Eng land ,  wh ich ,  w i th  the i r  key numbers in  the  S~w;ey,are 31 Somersetshire, 32 Wiltshire, 33 Berkshire, 3~ Surrey, 35 Kent,36 Cornwall, 37 Devonshire, 38 Dorsetshire, 39 Hampshire, and h0Sussex.
A :~ "~i of 75 localities in this area were reported os bythe Su~ey;  in what follows these will be identified by a four-digitrnumber, the first two digits indicating the county and the remainingtwo the locality.
Thus 3906 stands for Burley, the sixth localitylisted in hampshire, accordi~to the numbered list on p. 31 of theIntroduction to the 8ul-oey.
The data selected for examination3included all those words beginning with graphic f-, s-, or th-followed by a vowel or voiced consonant which were starred in the~ED questionnaire.
3 To this list we later added a few non-starredwords which showed universal distribution and were otherwise ofinterest.
The final list contained 68 words, of which 27 are f-words,22 s-words, 16 Sh-words and 3 ah-words (i.e.
words beginning with /~/in standard English).
We took only the first recorded form fromeach locality; this is presumably a citation form, produced by 8ninformant in response to a question, and recorded in narrow IPA trans-cription.
The 59 cases where no response was given were coded XXXin our computer code.The corpus thus comprised 68 x 75 or 5100 items, including the59 blanks.
Our c~,puter expert then produced 68 decks of punch-cards,one  for each word~ each deck containing 75 cards, one for each local-ity, These were numbered at the left for locality and on the rightfor the reference number of the item in the SED questionnaire.
~ Acoding system was devised which preserved all significant features ofthe phonetic transcription while passing over apparently irrelevantfine points (see Appendix A), and the words were transcribed in thiscode directly onto the cards for the guidance of the key-puncher,who then punched the coded words in a fixed place on the cards.Subsequently the standard spelling was inserted by the computer tothe left of the coded phonetic spelling.
This whole process tookabout a dozen hours of the investigators' time (not counting therelatively simple progras~ing involved) and about the same amount ofthe key-puncher's time.
The result was a body of data consisting of5100 entries of the following sort:3101 FINGER FIgG)R. 6 7 7This is to be interpreted as indicating that at locality 3101 (Westonin Somerset) the word f~nger, which appears as item VI.7.7 of theSED questionnaire, is pronounced \[f,ngar-\] (or perhaps more accu-rately /ftngar-/ in the quasi-phonemic transcription used).The nature of the problem with which we are dealing ms~ be mostsimply introduced by an excerpt frc~ the full treatment given to thevoicing of initial fricatives in Middle English by Horn and Lehnert(195~, Vol.

In den heutigen Mundarten yon Kent, Surreyund Sussex sind die anlautenden stinunhaften Laute unter demEinfluss des Hochenglischen durch stimmlose ersetzt worden,w ~ d  das ~stliche Herefordshire, Teile von Gloucestershire,das westliche Berkshire, und besonders Wiltshire, Dorsetshire,Scaersetshire told Devonshire stinunhafte Reibelaute im Anlautaufweisen.Horn-Lehnert go on to point out that by analogy and under theinfluence of Standard English, initial f- and s- in French loanwordshave become voiced.
This is borne out in our corpus by the words~ ,  ~Grmer, and ~ers ,  which have initial v- in more than halfthe localities included.
As our subsequent discussion and maps willshow, Horn-Lehnert should have included in the initial voiced frica-tive area the western half of Hampshire and all but the southwest tipof Cornwall.
Since the SED records for Herefordshire and Gloucester-shire have not yet been published, we have not been able to includethese  count ies  in  our survey.The t rad i t iona l  assumpt ions ,  then ,  are that  ~- ,  s - jand  ~- .bee~ne vo iced  (except  be fore  vo ice less  consonants)  in  in i t ia l  pos i -t ion  a t  an ear ly  date - -cer ta in ly  be fore  the  13th century - - in  thesoutheast ;  that  th i s  a f fec ted  a l l  nat ive  words ; that  th i s  change sub-sequent ly  spread  in to  the  o ld  West Saxon area o f  the  southwest  ; that6af ter  th i s  spread  vo ice less  in i t ia l  f r i ca t ives  were res tored  in  thesoutheast ;  and that  ana logy,  d ia lec t  borrowing,  and the  in f luence  o fs tandard  Eng l i sh  worked var ious ly  to  b lu r  the  except icmless  charac -te r  o f  the  sound change, to  produce vo ic ing  of  in i t ia l  2-  and a -in French loanwords and of initial ~- in native words like 8hiZlir~as well as French words like sure, and o the~se  to create a mixedsituation in the whole southern area.
5 Our project was to see whatlight the records of the SED can throw on this situation by exploit-ing them in some of the many ways made possible by computer techno-logy.The first step was to sort the data in as many ways as we feltwould be productive.
Accordingly our computer expert produced fourlists of the 5100 items, sorted as follows :List I: sorted first by keyword (the standard English graphicword identifying the item) alphabetically; then by locality.This list presents the data in the same kind of order in whichit appears in the SED records and allows easy inspection of allversions of each word in one list.List II: sorted first by locality and than by keyword alphabet-ically.
'Fais list brings together in one place all the recordsfrom each locality and thus permits comparison of the 8mount ofvoicing recorded fr~n various localities.List Ill: sorted first by locality and then by citation (therecorded local form) alphanumerically.
This list even more67graphically reveals the -mount of initial voicing; it also makesit easy to surmise from inspection whether or not incidence ofinitial voicing might be influenced by the following vowel orcG~Is onsIlt.List IV: sorted first on the second and following characters ofthe citation form, in linguistically significant order (i.e.
byvowels and consonants in articulatory order), then by the firstcharacter.
This list greatly facilitates looking into thequestion of the possible influence of following sounds on initialvoicing.These lists, though interesting in themselves, were cmm~ideredprimarily as intermediate diagnosti~ procedures, to be used to guideus in future ~ortlng, counting, and eventually mapping.
Even the mostcursory inspeetiou of them revealed what we had suspected frc~ ourfirst look at the data: that there is tremendous variatio~ withinthe relevant area both from word to word and from locality to local-i ty.
It ~ertainly seemed, at least so far as this feature in thisregion is concerned, that the maxim attributed to Gilli~ron, "Everyword has its own history," is true.Accordingly we asked our c~nputer expert for various more soph-isticated sortings and counts, and for two kinds of maps, to be pro-duced by the CalCump plotter (see Appendix B).
These were thefollowing:i.
A table for each of the four sets of words, listing all words78i n  the  set  and count ing  the  number o f  each occnr r f~ in i t ia l  conson-ant ,  the  words to  be ranked in  descend ing  order  o f  the  n~ber  o fin i t ia l  vo iced  consonants  recorded .
~ese  are  reproduced  here  asTables i - 4.2.
A list of all possible ~vowels, d ipht~s ,  and second conson-ants in each set of words, counted and tabulated in terms of eachpossible initial consonant.
A portion of this list is reproducedherewith as Table 5.3.
An individual map for each of the 68 words, showing theinitial consonant recorded for each locality.
Eight of these arereproduced here as Maps 6-13.4.
Four proportional maps, one for each set of words, indica-ting at each locality the voiceless:voiced ratios; thus for the~h-words the legend 3/13 occurring at B905 indicates that at thatlocality only three of the 16 d-words begin with voiceless consau-ants.
Map I shows the proportianal map for the e-words as it camefrom the plotter, while maps derived frc~ these proportional maps toreveal the varyiug distributions more clearly are included as Maps2 -5 .Tables i - ~ s~pport our suspicion that each word has its ownun ique  d i s t r ibut ion  w i th  regard  to  the  in i t ia l  c~nsonant .
Thus Table1 uhows that  ~ the  f -words  the  propor t ion  o f  vo ice less  to  vo icedranges  f r~ 20:5~ in  F~.LT~ to  52:22 in  FOAL.

Thus items 5 - 7 onthe table all have a voiceless-voiced ratio of 30:45, but the voice-less localities, at least in the area to the west of the major iso-gloss to be described below, are not the same.
FERN (see Map 13)is voiceless at 3102, 3604, 3902, and 3907 and voiced at 3405 andh003~ FINGER is voiceless at 3405, 3902~ 3907, and 4003 and voicedat 3102 and 3604; FIRE is voiceless at 3102, 3405, 3604, and 4003,and voiced at 3902 and 3907.
In tabular form:FERN F V F F F V .FINGER V F ~ V F F FFIRE F F F V V FThe same kind of discrepancy is shown by items 9 -  ii, with 33:42ratio, and items 12 - 14, with 34:41.Table i also shows that neither etymology nor following conson-ant seems to affect the distribution markedly.
The three Frenchwords, FLOUR, FARMER, and FLOWERS, appear in the middle of the list,with ratios of 35:40, 37:38, and 39:36 respectively.
The words withinitial ~-  are also in the middle, ranging from FLEAS 33:42 toFLOWERS 39: 36.The three last words on the list, with ratios 41:23, 52:22, and40:22, all show some peculiarity in the recordings indicating thatfor many of the informants they were unfamiliar, learned, or bookishwords, hence more likely to have standard English pronunciation.
Thus13i0FORD, the expected response to the question "Sometimes there is nobridge (over a rivulet).
What do you call that shallow place whereyou can walk across?"
(SED IV.1.3), was not known, not found, ornot recorded in seven localities, replaced by a local term (splash,sluice) in four others, and given as a "suggested word" (i.e.
onepronounced first by the field worker) in nine others.
Though FOALis recorded from all but one locality in answer to III.~.l, it isrevealed by the answers to another question (III.4.6) that in manylocalities the preferred word is colt.
The records also show thatFORKS (the agricultural kind), not recorded from 13 localities,yields to ~ other preferred local words (picks, prongs, spuds) in manyothers.
Likewise it has a mixed etymology, being derivable fromLatin furca either through OE forca or Anglo-Norman fourque.At the top of the list two words, FELLIES and FURROW, showunusual distribution in that voiced forms extend well into the usual-ly voiceless areas of Berkshire, Sussex, and the tip of Cornwall (seeMaps 6 and 7).
FELLIES also shows six instances of the substitutionof the dental fricative for the labial, which otherwise occurs onlyin FRIDAY, and which is reversed in six occurrences of /v/ in THATCH.If these five words are set aside, the range of voiceless-voicediratios, from 28:~7 to 43:3~ much more closely resembles that of theth-words (Table 3), which range from 29:45 to 41:33.Observations in similar detail can also be made on the basis o fTables 2 - 4, but exigencies of space suggest abridgement.
6 TheIOAMAP 6FmZI f  I I If__1zCEZ1510BilJt?/MAP 7II IIC~IIXII nHJIZb_16iimarked drop-off in voiced forms in the last five words of Table 2implies that, in contrast to initial ~-, the voicing of initial 8-is much reduced by a following nasal or /i/ (this will be discussedfurther below).
Voicing is not to be expected before a voicelessconsonant; we included STITCH because it shows one freakish occur-rence of initial \[z\] at 3901.
In this set the French words~ SECOND,SUE~f, and SEXTON, do appear well down the list, with ratios of ~4:31,~5:30, and 53:22 respectively.
If the words of French origin andthose with a consonant after the initial 8- are set aside, theremaining range of ratios, from 29:46 to 38:37, comes much closer tothat of the other sets.The th-words in Table 3 are, of course, all native words, sinceneither Norman nor Central French has had initial dental fricativesat any time when borrowing into English could occur.
Likewise theonly consonant that occurs at all frequently after initial /8/ or /~/is /r/.
Hence the range of ratios of the whole set is narrower thanthose of the f- and 8-words.
Noteworthy is the fact that throughoutthe voiced area, the initial cluster /@r/ appears as /dr/, presumablyas a result of a later change of /~/ to /d/ in this environment.7(See Map 8 for THRESH).
This same change has occurred in THISTLE inwestern Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall (see Map 9), and in THATCH (Mapi0) in south Devon and eastern Cornwall.
These two words also showinitial /v/ sporadically in Somerset and Dorset, presumably a substi-tution the opposite of that occurring in FELLIES in five localities.171.1.Aa~co  bao  X ?32MAP 8Z ~C~ ~n I!Z ~ xffD LD kkU II__1CE -1-0"3CE\] H Z\ ]Zk- - -I-----t18>^^ ^^^^ ^ ^^^ ^13..BMAP 9-0 ~) ~II II ItZ r../2 (~ XII II II^ ~-- J  L~CZ _~Z~-019?m' cD ?x~~ .

Why only two o f  the 16 %h-words should show th i skind of substitutic~ remains unexplained.
~here is certainly nothingin their etymology to account for it.Table ~ lists the only three sh-words that show more than a fewscattered instances of initial /~/" The other ~tarred words of thissort, with the number of occurrences of initial voicing for each, are8heuf ~, s~ep i, she~f 3j 8hoe 2, and sh~;eZ 3.
Even the threewords listed have a ratio characteristic of the low end of the otherlists: 52:22 for SUGAR (a French loanword), 57:18 for the nativeword "SHILLING, and 62:13 for another French word, SURE.
Presumablythe two French words had sc~ellhing like initial \[s J-\] at the time ofborrowing, while 8~ILL~N~ and the other native words had /s~-/ untillater OE.
Instances of voicing in these words is to be attributedwholly to analogy, prest~ably with the s-words.
As might beexpected, the heaviest concentration of voiced forms is in the "hard-core" voicing areas in Devonshire and western Hampshire (see Map 5),but there are scattered instances in Sc~ereet, Dorset, and Wilts.
(see Map ii for SHILLING).Just as Tables i - 4 reveal the wide variety in voiceless-voicedratio for individual words, so Maps 2 - 5 show the same variety forindividual localities.
These m~ps have been simplified from theor ig ina l  cce~uter-produced proport iona l  maps described above, whichwere in the form shown in Map 1.

A little to the north of this it sepa-rates two localities--Burbage, Wilts., and Inkpen, Berks.--which areonly 8 miles apart and yet show voiceless voiced ratios of @:16 and15:1 respectively in the th-words.
It is equally well marked for theother sets, though in the case of the f-words the ~explicable easternextension of voicing in two words--FELLIES AND FURR0W--creates theappearance of a transitional area (Map 2).The maps also show that the voicing did not extend to the south-west tip of Cornwall except in a few words.
Presumably the Englishbrought into this formerly Celtic area was more strongly influencedby standard English.
The extreme case is represented by 3607, whichhas voicing in only two of the 68 words: FELLIES and FURROW, which,as we have seen above also extend beyond the voicing area on the east.2313AMAP iOr-)I - -ZE30,.o ~_,, L_L__I C~Q-~ ~ C__~ ~7cl~ m',l o, ) ,o-~ ~''" a )  ~ ~,,r ~I.-.---Im,J2.4MAP 2~ , ~ ~~,-" OHUgll2513CtL.IIIt,MAP 3~.

Just west of the main eastern iso-gloss is an area where voicing is virtually total for all sets ofwords.
The area differs in size from one set to another, beinglarger for the f- and th-words than for the s- and sh-words, but i t sheart is western Hampshire, Dorset, and part of southern Wiltshire.It is separated from the other area of almost total voicing in Devon-shire by a mixed area in Somerset and Wiltshire where the proportionof voicing among the words examined ranges from 25% to 75%.Finally there are fringe areas in the east and in southern Cornwallwhere ~ ly  a few of the words~those  high on the lists in Tables1 - h--show voicing.
In the light of the traditional historical viewof a feature spreading west from Kent, as ex~pressed in the quotationfrom Horn-Lehnert above, this distribution is a bit puzzling.
Fullexploration of its implications must be postponed to a later study.One possible explanation of the variation in the incidence ofvoicing from one word to another is to be sought in the influence ofthe sounds immediately following the initial fricative.
Chart Idisplm~vs some of the characteristics of the four sets with regard toto following phonemes.
The sh-words have far less initial voicingthan the other sets.
No more thou 22 localities have initial voicingfor any single word in this set.
On the other hand, the s-words dem-omStrate the widest range: frc~ voicing in 46 localities to a longtail of words with no initial voicing anywhere.
The most stable is29lkAi3O15the th- set, which has between 45 and 33 localities with voicing.This means that for all words but one in this set, over half thelocalities have a voiced initial fricative.
This is the highestproportion for any set.The sound following the initial fricative has been indicated onChart I in terms of three categories:+ vowel (unmarked)+ voiced consonant (marked with square)+ voiceless consonant (marked with dot)There is a striking correlation between voiceless initial fricativeand a following voiceless consonant in the s-words (no other set hasa voiceless consonant in second position).

Table 6 shows that forf-, s-, and th-words, high and low front vowels /y, i; ~/ and lowcentral vowels /a, a/ associate with initial voicing.
For the threesets taken together the proportion of voiced initial fricatives occur-ring with these vowels following is between 60 and 63 per cent.TABLE 6PROPORTION OF VOICELESS TO VOICED INITIAL FRICATIVESIN RELATION TO THE FOLLOWING VOWEL IN F-, S-, TH-WORDSMidFront62%189/30836%248/lhO6o%Low 119/176Cent ra l  Back5O%6/0 iO9/lO855% 5~%~35/5h0 h3/5063~ ~o%197/329 252/167There is negative association between voicing and mid front /e, e, c?/as well as low back vowels /D, 3/.

Vowel lengthappears to have no appreciable correlation with the voicing orunvoicing of the initial fricative.Rounded high front vowels /Y, y/ showed a more marked associa-tion with initial voicing than unrounded high front vowels /I, i/.The ratios for all f- and s-words with rounded front vowels are:FOOT @:16; SOOT 1:15, SUCK @:7, SUET 1:15.
If we make a table for allthe second vowels in SOOT (Map 12), we get:Central BackHigh i:15 @:i 32:191:2 MidLowThere is, of course, a possibility here of pseudo-correlation, causedfor instance by the possibility that those localities which havethe fronted /Y/ for standard English /U/ in words like SOOT happento be located in the area of strongest voicing.
Investigation of thispossibility must await further study.The tendency for high front vowels generally to co-occur withvoiced initial fricatives is, however, obvious in words like FERN(Map 13) where no rounding is involved:F ront  Central~:ibMid @:2 30:21Low @:63518Finally, to illustrate the difference in correlation with low centraland low back vowels, we may cite the figures for FORTY.
Thevoiceless:voiced ratio with a low central vowel \[a, a:, a, a:\] is13:17~ while with a low back \[D, ~\] it is 27:18.It is clear that even more study, of individual words and indi-vidual localities, is needed before all the complications of thisone  dialect feature can be unraveled.
We should, for example~ takeinto account the second and third responses for many of the words~many of which were taken from incidental conversation and hence areinclined to be more natural.
Even casual inspection of the dataindicates that they show a much higher incidence of initial voicingthan do the citation forms.
But we hope that this paper has shownthat, given adequate and convenient data, the computer can be ofinestimable aid to the dialectologist.3619NOTES1An except ion  i s  the  D ic t ionary  o f  American Reg iona l  Eng l i sh  (DARE),be ing  prepared  at  the  Un ivers i ty  o f  Wiscons in  under  the  d i rec t iono f  F reder ic  O.

Output  cou ld  be in t r i ca te ly  p lacedc~ a pr in ted  page ,  and then  a map out l ine  cou ld  be super imposed onthat  page by hand.
In  th i s  way we cou ld  ach ieve  our  bas ic  goa l ,  thato f  hav ing  the  computer  de the  ted ious  task  o f  sor t ing  and ta l l y ingthe  l ingu is t i c  data  to  be d i sp layed ,  wh i le  leav ing  a minimum of  workto  the  researcher .
But th i s  idea  was not  p l iab le  enough to  le t  usrepresent  a map as  i t  ac tua l ly  i s .
The squareness  of  the  fo rmat  andthe  constant  d i s tance  between characters  on the  pr in ted  page made i timposs ib le  to  reproduce  any map w i th  su f f i c ient  accuracy .A second method d iscussed  was to  output  the  ent i re  map and dataon a v i sua l  d i sp lay  un i t  such as a CRT scope .
Here we cou ld  draw themap, but  our  p r in t ing  fo rmat  was aga in  too  s t r i c t .
Th is  method a l soi s  expens ive ,  s ince  i t  requ i res  the  use  o f  an on- l ine  scope .We f ina l ly  dec ided  upon an o f f - l ine  p lo t te r .
The one we usedwas a CalCump #563 D ig i ta l  P lo t te r .
Th is  machine takes  a conputertape  which has been prodneed by an on- l ine  computer  p rogram anddraws the  date  in  the  tape  onto  a ro l l  o f  paper .
In  o rder  to  v i sua l -i ze  how the  p lo t te r  works ,  imagine a set  o f  coord inate  axes w i th  ay-axis about 12" long and an infinitely long x-axis.
This grid isthe piece of paper to he plotted on.
The instructions to the plotterare simple.
They boil down to two: , ~ lower or raise the pen point(so it wil l  or wil l  not write as it moves) and move the pen in astraight line to location (x,y) on the grid.
In this manner anythingcan be drawn, f r~  straight lines to circles, letters, and numbers(curves are actually made up of very short straight line segments ).The routines used to produce CalComp tapes are FORTRAN sub-routines.
It was therefore necessary to write a FORTRAN programwhose input would be (i) instructions for drawing the outline of amap and plotting localities within it, and (2) linguistic data in aspecially processed format.
The output would be the tape whichdirects the p lo t ter .24Two methods were tried out for producing the map outline.
Inthe first, a transparent grid was placed over a map and coordinatesof "bends" in the outline were recorded.
Thus a map would be pro-duced by moving in a straight line from one bend to another.
Themap produced by this method gave only a rough approximation of theoriginal because we could not find a grid small enough to representaccurately all the bends and curves in the outline of the map.
Thesecond method was much more successful.
A digitizer was used tomeasure and record the coordinates of bonds in the outline and thepositions of the localities within the area covered.
The digitizer(~sed by courtesy of the American Mathematical Society, Providence,R.I.)
consists of a large table and a "bomb-sight" connected to apaper-tape punch.
The crosshairs of the bombsight are moved alongthe  out l ine  o f  the  map, and a l l  coord inates  a re  accurate ly  measuredand  p~ched onto  paper  tape .
Th is  paper  tape  then  becomes the  d i rec tinput  to  the  computer .
Spec ia l  codes  were used  to  ins t ruc t  the  p lo t -te r  to  l i f t  the  pen  ( to  move away and draw an i s land ,  fo r  example)  o rto  ind icate  that  the  next  coord inates  wou ld  be the  pos i t ions  o floca l i t ies  on the  map.
When the  program was completed ,  the  ins t ruc -t ions  fo r  d rawing  the  out l ine  o f  Eng land  and mark ing  the  coord inatesof the 311 localities of the SurUey of EngZish D4uleot8 requiredabout 4000 x and y measurements.
\[For the present paper only thebottom quarter of the map, with 75 localities, was used.\]The raw linguistic data was keypunched onto cards using thephonetic coding discussed above (Appendix A).
Also on the cards werethe numbers of the county and locality and the keywords.
For example,the card for SUGAR, county 31, locality ~, was310~ SU~A~ ;%G)R: 5.
8.10fSince the corpus of data included 68 words for each of the 75 loc-alities in Southern England, the card input consisted of 5100 cards.These records could be sorted by phonetic word (citation), by locality,by key~ord, or by any combination of these.4225A PL / I  p rogram was wr i t ten  to  examine the  records  and to  outputthe  l ingu is t i c  resu l t s  which were to  be drawn onto a map.
Th isoutput  was then  read  in  by the  FORTRAN p lo t t ing  program.
The inputto  the  p lo t t ing  program was o f  a s tandard  fo rmat :MAP NB~4BER; COUNTY; LOCALITY; NUMBER OF SYMBOL$; LINE NUMBER; MESSAGEFor example, the card3 33 5 7 3-F/I-Vmeant "on map #3 draw the seven characters 3-F/I-V at locality 5 incounty 33."
"Line number" was used to produce the legend at thebottom of each map.
The legend was drawn whenever the county andlocality numbers were @.
For example, the instruction2 ~ ~ 18 i INITIAL CONSONANTSmeant "~ map #2 write the above message at the position for line iof the legend.
"The input to the plotting program came in sorted by map number.Whenever a new map number was read in (meaning that all the data forthe previous map had been plotted), the program would issue instruc-tions to move over on the plotting paper and draw a new map outline.Data would then be drawn on this new map until a different one wasrequested.
Thus one run of each of the PL/I and FORTRAN programscould produce any number of related or even unrelated maps.It should be apparent that the great virtues of this method ofproducing both working and finished dialectal maps are speed andaccuracy.
Anyone who has produced even rough working maps bystamping or drawing symbols on an outline map knows how time-consuming and tedious this process is, and how subject it is toerror.
The computer never wearies and never (we trustl) makes an~error.
As a result, the dialectologist can experiment with all kindsof working maps and select those which are interesting or significant.This should add a new dimension to the study of linguistic geography.~3
