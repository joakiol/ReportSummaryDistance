Trans-fer takes place at the level of Quasi Logical Form(QLF), a contextually sensitive logical form rep-resentation which is deep enough for dealing withcross-linguistic differences.
Theoretical argumentsand experimental results are presented to supportthe claim that this framework has good proper-ties in terms of modularity, compositionality, re-versibility and monotonicity.1 INTRODUCTIONIn this paper we describe a translation projectwhose aim is to build an experimental BilingualConversation Interpreter (BCI) which will allowcommunication through typed text between twomonolingual humans using different languages (ofMiike et al 1988).
The choice of languages for theprototype system is English and Swedish.
Inputsentences are analysed by the Core Language En-gine (CLE 1) as far as the level of Quasi LogicalForm (QLF; Alshawi, 1990), and then, instead offurther ambiguity resolution, undergo transfer intoanother QLF having constants and predicates cor-responding to word senses in the other language.The transfer ules used in this process correspondto a certain kind of meaning postulate.
The CLEthen generates an output, sentence from the target1 Tile CLE is described in Alshawi (1991) which includesmore detailed iscussion of the BCI architecture in a chap-ter by the present, authors,language QLF, using the same linguistic data asis used for analysis of that language.QLFs were selected as the appropriate level fortransfer because they are far enough removed fromsurface linguistic form to provide the flexibility re-quired by cross-linguistic differences.
On the otherhand, the linguistic, unification-based processinginvolved in creating them can be carried out effi-ciently and without the need to reason about thedomain or context; the QLF language has con-structs for explicit representation of contextuallysensitive aspects of interpretation.When it is necessary, for correct translation, toresolve an ambiguity present at QLF level, the BCIsystem interacts with the source language user tomake the necessary decision, asking for a choicebetween word sense paraphrases or between alter-native partial bracketings of the sentence.

is thus a strong connection between our choice ofa representation sensitive to context and the useof interaction to resolve context dependent ambi-guities, but in this paper we concentrate on repre-sentational and transfer issues.2 CLE  REPRESENTATIONLEVELSIn this section we explain how QLF fits into theoverall architecture of the CLE and in section 3 wediscuss the reasons for choosing it for interactivedialogue translation.1612.1 CLE  Process ing PhasesA coarse view of the CLE architecture is that itconsists of a linguistic analysis phase followed bya contextual interpretation phase.
The output ofthe first phase is a set of alternative QLF analy-ses of a sentence, while the output of the secondis an RQLF (resolved QLF) representation f theinterpretation of an utterance:Sentence --linguistic analysis--~ QL FsQ X, Fs ---contextual interpretation---*" R Q L F.Deriving a fairly conventional Logical Form (LF)from the RQLF is then a simple formal mappingwhich removes the information in the RQLF thatis not concerned with truth conditions.Linguistic analysis and contextual interpreta-tion each consist of several subphases.
For anal-ysis these are: orthography, morphological anal-ysis, syntactic analysis (parsing), and (composi-tional) semantic analysis.
Apart from the first,these analysis ubphases are based on the unifica-tion grammar paradigm, and they all use declara-tive bidirectional rules.When the CLE is being used as an interface to acomputerized information system (e.g.
a databasesystem), its purpose is to derive an LF represen-tation giving the truth conditions of an utteranceinput by a user.
The LF language is based onfirst order predicate logic extended with general-ized quantifiers and some other higher order con-structs (Alshawi and van Eijck, 1989).
For ex-ample, in a context where she can refer to MarySmith, and one to "a car", a possible LF for Shehired one is:quant (ex is ts  ,C, \[carl ,C\],quant (ex is ts  ,E, \[event ,El,\[past, \[hir ?
I, E, mary_smith, C\] \] ) ).This can be paraphrased as "There is a car C, andan event E such that, in the past, ~.
is a hiringevent by Mary Smith of e." In this notation, quan-tified formulae consist of a generalized quantifier,a variable, a restriction and a scope; square brack-ets are used for the application of predicates andoperators to their arguments.
To arrive at suchLF representations, a number of intermediate l v-els of representation are produced by successivemodular components.Generation of linguistic expressions in the CLEtakes place from QLFs (or from RQLFs by map-ping them to suitable QLFs).
Since the rulesused during the analysis phase are declarative andbidirectional, these are also used for generation.To achieve computationally efficient analysis andgeneration, the rules are pre-compiled in differentways for application in the two directions.
Gen-eration uses the semantic-head driven algorithm(Shieber et al 1990).2.2 The  QLF LanguageThe QLF representations produced for a sen-tence are neutral with respect o the choice of ref-erents for pronouns and definite descriptions, andrelations implied by compound nouns and ellip-sis.
They are also neutral with respect o otherambiguities corresponding to alternative scopingsof quantifiers and operators and to the collec-tive/distributive and referential/attributive dis-tinctions.
The QLF is thus the level of represen-tation encoding the results of compositional lin-guistic analysis independently of contextually sen-sitive aspects of understanding.
These aspectsare addressed by the contextual interpretationphase which has the following subphases: quan-tifier scoping (Moran 1988), reference resolution(Alshawi 1990), and plausibility judgement.The QLF language is a superset of the LFlanguage containing additional expressions corre-sponding, for example, to unresolved anaphors.More specifically, there are two additionalterm constructs (anaphoric terms and quanti-fied terms), and one additional formula construct(anaphoric formulae):a_term( Category, Entity Vat, Restriction).q_term( Category, Entity Vat, Restriction).a_form(Category, Pred Var , Restriction).These QLF constructs contain syntactic andmorphological information in the Category andlogical (truth-conditional) information in theRestriction, itself a QLF formula binding the vari-able.
A QLF from which the LF for She hired onecould have been derived is:\[past,\[hire,q_term (<t =quant, n=s ing>,E, \[event, E\] ) ,a_term(<t =ref, p=pro, l=she, n=sing>,Y, \[female, Y\] ),q_t erm (<t =quant, n=sing>,C, a_f orm(<t =pred, l=one>,P, \ [P .C\ ] ) ) \ ] \ ] .162in which categories are shown as lists of feature-value specifications (the feature shown are t forQLF expression type, n for number, p for phrasetype, and 1 for lexical information).
The differ-ences between the QLF shown here and the LFshown earlier are that the quantified terms havebeen scoped, the anaphoric term for she has beenresolved to Mary Smith, and the anaphoric NPrestriction implicit in one has been resolved usingthe predicate car.The RQLF representation f an utterance in-cludes all the information from the QLF, togetherwith the resolutions of QLF constructs made dur-ing the contextual interpretation phase.
For ex-ample, the referent of an a_term is unified withthe a_term variable.Some constraints on plausibility can be ap-plied at the QLF level before a full interpreta-tion has been derived.
This is because most ofthe predicate-argument structure of an utterancehas been determined at that point, allowing, inparticular, the application of sortal constraintsexpected by predicates of their arguments.
Sor-tal constraints cut down on structural (e.g.
at-tachment) ambiguity, and on word sense ambigu-ity, the latter being particularly important for thetranslation application in the context of large vo-cabularies.3 REPRESENTATION LEVELSFOR TRANSFERThe representational structures on which trans-fer operates must contain information correspond-ing to several inguistic levels, including syntaxand semantics.
For transfer to be general, it mustoperate recursively on input representations.
Wecall the level of representation  which this re-cursion operates the "organizing" level; semanticstructure is the natural choice, since the basic re-quirement of translation is that it preserves mean-ing.Syntactic phrase structure transfer, or deep-syntax transfer (e.g.
Thurmair 1990, Nagao andTsujii 1986) results in complex transfer rules,and the predicate-argument structure which is re-quired for the application of sortal restrictions inot represented.McCord's (1988, 1989) organizing level appearsto be/hat, of surface syntax, with additional deepsyntactic and semantic ontent attached to nodes.As we have argued, this level is not optimal, whichmay be related to the fact that McCord's sys-tem is explicitly not symmetrical: different gram-mars are used for the analysis and synthesis of thesame language, which are viewed as quite differ-ent tasks.
Isabelle and Macklovitch (1986) argueagainst such asymmetry between analysis and syn-thesis on the grounds that, although it is temptingas a short-cut o building a structure sufficientlywell-specified for synthesis to take place, asym-metry means that the transfer component mustcontain a lot of knowledge about the target lan-guage, with dire consequences for the modularityof the system and the reusability of different partsof it.
In the BCI, however, the transfer ules con-tain only cross-linguistic knowledge, allowing theanalysis and generation to make use of exactly thesame data.Kaplan et al(1989) allow multiple levels ofrepresentation to take part in the transfer rela-tion.
However, Sadler et al(1990) point out thatthe particular approach to realizing this taken byKaplan et alhas problems of its own and doesnot cleanly separate monolingual from contrastiveknowledge.The CLE processing subphases offer three se-mantic representations of different depth as can-didates for an appropriate transfer level, namelyQLF, RQLF and LF.
At the LF level, sortal re-strictions can be applied, but the form of nounphrase descriptions used and also information ontopicalization is no longer present; the LF rep-resentation is too abstract for transfer.
On theother hand, not all the information appearing inthe RQLF about how QLF constructs have beenresolved is necessary for translation.
Resolved ref-erents are not an adequate generator input for def-inite descriptions in the target language, since theview of the referent in the source is lost duringtranslation.
Another case is that translation fromresolved ellipsis can result in unwieldy target sen-tences.
In arguing for QLF-level transfer, we areasserting that predicate-argument relations of thetype used in QLF are the appropriate organizinglevel for compositional transfer, while not denyingthe need for syntactic information to ensure that,for example, topichood or the given/new distinc-tion is preserved.Finally, in contrast o systems uch as Rosetta(Landsbergen, 1986) which depend on stating ruleby rule correspondences between source and targetgrammars, we wish to make the monolingual de-scriptions as independent as possible from the taskof translating between two languages.
Apart from163its attractions from a theoretical point of view,this has practical advantages in allowing gram-mars to be reused for different language pairs andfor applications other than translation.4 QLF  TRANSFERQLF transfer involves taking a QLF analysis ofa source sentence, say QLF1, and deriving from itanother expression, QLF2, from which it is possi-ble to generate a sentence in the target language.Leaving aside unresolved referential expressions,the main difference between QLF1 and QLF2 isthat they will contain constants, particularly pred-icate constants, that originate in word sense en-tries from the lexicons of the respective languages.If more than one candidate source language QLFexists, the appropriate one is selected by present-ing the user with choices of word sense paraphrasesand of bracketings relating to differences in thesyntactic analyses from which the QLFs were de-rived.A transfer ule specifies a pair of QLF patterns.The left hand side matches QLF expressions forone language and the right hand side matchesthose for the other:trans(<QLFl subexpression pattern><Operator><QLF2 subexpression pattern>).If the operator is == then the rule is bidirectional.Otherwise, a single direction of applicability is in-dicated by use of one of the operators >= or =<.Transfer rules are applied recursively, this pro-cess following the recursive structure of the sourceQLF.
In order to allow transfer between struc-turally different QLFs, rules with 'transfer vari-ables' need to be used.
These variables, whichtake the form tr(atom), show how subexpressionsin the source QLF  correspond to subexpressionstranslating them in the target QLF.
For exam-ple, the following rule expresses an equivalencebetween the English to be called (" I  am calledJohn"), and the Swedish beta ("Jag heter John").trans ( \[call_name,t r (ev) ,q_term(<tfquant ,n=sing>,A, \[entity,A\] ),t r(ag),tr(name)\]\[heCal, Cr (ev), tr (ag), Cr (name) \] ).Transfer ules often correspond irectly to inter-lingual meaning postulates: when the expressionsin a transfer ule are formulae, the symbols ==, >=,and =< can be read as the logical operators <-->,-->, and <-- respectively.
A rule likeCrans (\[and, \[bafll ,X\], \[luckl ,X\]\]\[otur I, x\] )translating between the English bad luck and theSwedish otur, can be interpreted in this way.We will now assess the method's strengths andweaknesses, as they have manifested themselves inpractice.
We will pay particular attention to thecriteria of expressiveness, compositionality, sim-plicity, reversibility and monotonicity.We take the last point first, since it is the moststraightforward one.
Since rules are applied purelynondeterministically and by pure unification, weget monotonicity "for free" - although there is acase for disallowing transfer by decomposition ofa complex QLF structure which directly matchesone side of a transfer ule.
The other points needmore discussion.4.1 ExpressivenessSince we are intentionally limiting ourselves bynot allowing access to full syntactic information(but only to that placed in QLF  categories) in thetransfer phase, it is legitimate to wonder whetherthe formalism can really be sufficiently expressive.Here, we will attempt to answer this criticism; webegin by noting that shortcomings in this area canbe of several distinct kinds.
Sometimes, a formal-ism can appear to make it necessary to write manyrules, where one feels intuitively that one shouldbe enough; we treat this kind of problem under theheading of compositionality.
In other cases, thedifficulty is rather that there does not appear tobe any way of expressing the rule at all in terms ofthe given formalism.
In our case, a fair proportionof problems that at first seem to fall into this cate-gory can be eliminated by having adequate mono-lingual grammars and using the target grammaras a filter; the idea is to allow the transfer com-ponent to produce unacceptable QLFs  which arefiltered out by fully constrained target grammars.A good example of the use of this technique isthe English definite article, which in Swedish canbe translated as a gender-dependent article, butpreferably is omitted; however, an article is oblig-atory before an adjective.
Solving this problem164\[, Table 1: Types of complex transfer usedType ExampleDifferent John likes Maryparticles John tyeker  om MaryPassive Insurance is inc ludedto active FSrs~ikring ingArVerb John owes Mary $20to adjective John ~ir skyldig Mary $20Support verb John had an accidentto normal verb John rltkade ut fdren olyckaSingle verbto phraseIdiomaticuse of PPJohn wants a carJohn vii1 ha en bil(lit.
: "wants to have")John is in a hur ryJohn har  br  t tom(lit.
: "has hurry")at transfer level is not possible, since the transfercomponent has no way of knowing that a piece oflogical form will be realized as an adjective; thereare many cases where an adjective-noun combina-tion in English is best translated as a compoundnoun in Swedish.
Exploiting the fact that the rele-vant constraint is present in the Swedish grammar,however, the "transfer-and-filter" method reducesthe problem to two simple lexical rules.
Sortal re-strictions at the target end can also be used as afilter in a similar way.4.2 Simplicity and reversibilityThe most obvious way to put the case with re-gard to simplicity is by giving a count of the vari-ous categories of rule, and providing evidence thatthere is a substantial proportion of rules which aresimple in our framework, but would not necessar-ily be so in others.The transfer component currently contains 718rules.
576 of these (80.2%) have the property thatboth the right- and left-hand sides are atomic.502 members of this first group (69.9%) translatesenses of single words to senses of single words;the remaining 74 (10.3%) translate atomic con-stants representing the senses of complex syntacticconstructions, most commonly verbs taking parti-cles, reflexives, or complementizers.
An exampleis the following rule, which defines an equivalencebetween English care about ('John cares aboutMary") and Swedish bry sig om ( "John bryr sigom Mary", lit.
"John cares himself about Mary").J Table ~: Transfer contexts used'context Example 'Perfect tenseNegatedJohn has liked MaryJohn har tyckt om MaryJohn doesn't like MaryJohn tycker inte om MaryYN-question Does John like Mary?Tycker John om Mary?WH-question Who does John like?Veto tycker John om?Passive Mary was liked by JohnMary blev omtyckt av JohnRelative The woman that John likesclauseSententialcomplementEmbeddedquestionVP modifierObjectraisingChangeof aspectKvinnan som John tycker omI think John likes MaryJag tror John tycker om MaryI know who John likesJag vet vem John tycker omJohn likes Mary todayJohn tycker om Mary idagI want John to like MaryJag vill att John ska tycka omMary("I want that J. shall like M.")John stopped liking MaryJohn slutade tycka om Mary("J. stopped like-INF M.")trans(care_about == bry_sig_om).Since vocabulary has primarily been selectedwith regard to utility (we have, for example, madeconsiderable use of frequency dictionaries (Alldn1970)), we think it reasonable to claim that QLF-based transfer is simplifying the construction oftransfer ules in a substantial proportion of thecommonly encountered cases.On the score of reversibility, we will once againcount cases; here we find that 659 (91.8%) of therules are reversible, 17 (2.4%) work only in theEnglish-Swedish direction, and 42 (5.8%) only inthe Swedish-English direction.
These also seem tobe fairly good figures.4.3 CompositionalityAs in any rule-based system, "compositionality"corresponds to the extent o which it is necessaryto provide special mechanisms to cover cases of ir-regular interactions between rules.
As far as weknow, there is no accepted benchmark for testing165compositionality of transfer; what we have done,as a first step in this direction, is to select six com-mon types of complex transfer, and eleven com-mon contexts in which they can occur.
These aresummarized in tables 1 and 2 respectively.
Eachcomplex transfer type is represented by a samplerule, as shown in table 1; the question is the ex-tent to which the complex transfer ules continueto function in the different contexts (table 2).To test transfer compositionality properly, it isnot sufficient simply to note which rule/contextcombinations are handled correctly; after all, it isalways possible to create a completely ad hoc so-lution by simply adding one transfer ule for eachcombination.
The problem must rather be posedin the following terms: if there is a single rule foreach complex transfer type, and a number of rulesfor each context, how many extra rules must beadded to cover special combinations?
It is thisissue we will address.The actual results of the tests were as follows.There were 124 meaningful combinations (someconstructions could not be passivized); in 103 ofthese, transfer was perfectly compositional, and noextra rule was needed.
For example, the Englishsentence for the combination "Verb to adjective +WH-question" is How much does John owe Mary.The corresponding Swedish sentence is Hut my-cket dr John skyldig Mary?
("How much is Johnindebted-to Mary?
"), and the two QLFs areS:\[uhq,\[pres,\[owe_have_to_pay,q_term(<t=quant,n=sing>,A,\[event,A\]),a_term(<t=ref,p=name>,B,\[name_of,B,john\]),q_term(<t=quant,l=wh>,C,\[quantity,C\]),a_term(<t=ref,p=name>,D,\[name_of,D,mary\])\]\]\]\[whq,\[pro8 ent,\[Va.T a,q_t erm(<t =quanE, n=sing>, A, \[state.
A\] ),\[skyldiE_nsn_nst,a_t erm (<t =ref, p=name>,B, \[name_o~, B, j ohn3 ) ,a_term(<t=ref, p=name>,C, \[name_of, C mary\] ),q_t erm(<t =quant, l=wh> ,D, \[quantity, D\] )\] \] \] \]It should be evident hat the complex transferrule defining the equivalence between owe and yarnskyldig,t ransC\ [owe_have_to_pay,q_ termC<t=quant ,n=s ing>,A , \ [event ,A \ ] ) ,t r (ag) , t r ( sum) , t r (ob j ) \ ]\[vara,q_term(<t=quant,n=sing>,A,\[state,A\]),\[skyldig_ngn_ngt,t rCag) , t rCob j ) , t r ( sum) \ ] \ ] ) .is quite unaffected by being used in the context ofa Wit-question.Of the remaining 21 rule/context/directiontriples, seven failed for basically uninteresting rea-sons: the combination "Perfect ense + Passive-to-active" did not generate in English, and the sixsentences with the object-raising rule all failed inthe Swedish-English direction due to the transfercomponent's current inability to create a function-application from a closed form.
The final fourteenfailures are significant from our point of view, andit is interesting to note that all of them resultedfrom mismatches in the scope of tense and nega-tion operators.The question ow becomes that of ascertainingthe generality of the extra rules that need to beadded to solve these fourteen unwanted interac-tions.
Analysis showed that it was possible toadd 26 extra rules (two of which were relevanthere), which reordered the scopes of tense, nega-tion and modifiers, and accounted for the scopedifferences between the English and Swedish QLFsarising from the general divergences in word-orderand negation of main verbs.
These solved tenof the outstanding cases.
For example, the com-bination "Different particles + Negated" is Johndoesn't like Mary in English and John tycker inteom Mary (lit.
: "John thinks not about Mary") inSwedish; the QLF-pair is:\ [pres  p\[not,\ [ l ike,q_t erm(<t=quant ,n=sing>, A, \[event, A\] ),a_term (<t=ref, p=name>,B, \[name_o~, B, j ohn\] ),a_termC<t=ref, p=name>,B, \[~ame_of, B mary\] )\] \] \]2 ~r is the present tense of ~ara.166\[not,\[present,\[tycka_om,q_t erm(<t =quant, n=s ing>, A, \[event, A\] ),a_t erm(<t =ref, p=name>,B, \[name_of, B, john\] ),a_term(<t=ref, p=name>,B, \[name_o:f, B mary\] ) \] \] \]The extra rule here,trans( \[pres, \[not,tr(body)\]\] ==\[not, \[present, tr (body)\] \] ).reorders the scopes of the negation and present-tense operators, but does not need to access theinterior structure of the QLF (the "body" vari-able); this turns out to be the case for most inter-actions of negation, VP-modification and complextransfer.
It is thus not surprising that a smallnumber of similar rules covers most of the cases.The four bad interactions left all involved theEnglish verb to be; these were the combinations"Passive to active ?
VP modifier" and "Idiomaticuse of PP q- negation", which failed to transferin either direction.
Here, there is no general solu-tion involving the addition of a small number ofextra rules, since the problem is caused by an oc-currence of to be on the English side that is notmatched by an occurrence of the correspondingSwedish word on the other.
The solution mustrather be to add an extra rule for each complexfransfer ule in the relevan~ class to cover the badinteraction.
To solve the specific examples in thetest set, two extra rules were thus required.Summarizing the picture, the tests revealed thatall bad interactions between the transfer ules andcontexts hown here could be removed by addingfour extra rules to cover the 124 possible interac-tions.
In a general perspective (viewing the rulesas representatives of their respective classes), therule-interaction problems exemplified by the con-crete collisions were solved by adding?
26 general rules to cover certain standardscope mismatches caused by verb-inversionand negation.?
two extra rules (one for present and one forpast tense) for each complex transfer ule ofeither the "Idiomatic use of PP" or "Activeto Passive" types, to cover idiosyncratic in-teractions of these with negation and VP-modification respectively.We view these results as very promising: therewere few bad interactions, and those that ex-isted were of a regular nature that could be coun-teracted without fear of further unwelcome side-effects.
This gives good grounds for hoping thatthe system could be scaled up to a practically use-ful size without suffering the usual fate of drown-ing in a sea of ad hoc fixes.5 IMPLEMENTATION STATUSThe current implementation i cludes analysis,transfer, and generation modules, sizable gram-mars with morphological, syntactic and semanticrules for English and Swedish, and an experimen-tal set of transfer ules for this language pair.
Rel-ative to the size of the grammars, the lexicons arestill small (approximately 2000 and 1000 words re-spectively).
About 250 entries for each languagehave been added for a specific domain (car hire),which makes possible moderately unconstrainedconversation on this topic; the system, includingthe facilities for interactive resolution of trans-lation problems, has been tested on a corpus ofabout 400 sentences relating to the domain.
Forshort sentences typical of the car hire domain, me-dian total processing times for analysis, transferand generation are around ten seconds when run-ning under Quintus Prolog on a SUN SPARCst~-tion 2.We are currently investigating a different QLFrepresentation f Iense, aspect and modality whichshould increase the transfer compositionality forthe operator cases we have discussed in this pa-per, as well as allowing more flexible resolutionof temporal relations in applications other thantranslation.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe work reported here was funded by theSwedish Institute of Computer Science, and thegreater part of it was carried out while the thirdauthor was employed there.
We would like tothank Steve Pulman for many helpful discussions,especially with regard to the problems encoun-tered in adapting the English grammar to Swedish.167REFERENCESAlldn, Sture (ed.)
