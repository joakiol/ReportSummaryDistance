Francepsluquet@info.unicaen.frAbstractThis paper deals with multilingual data-base generation from parallel corpora.The idea is to contribute to the enrich-ment of lexical databases for languageswith few linguistic resources.
Our ap-proach is endogenous: it relies on the rawtexts only, it does not require externallinguistic resources such as stemmers ortaggers.
The system produces alignmentsfor the 20 European languages of the?Acquis Communautaire?
Corpus.1 Introduction1.1 Automatic processing of bilingual andmultilingual corporaProcessing bilingual and multilingual corporaconstitutes a major area of investigation in natu-ral language processing.
The linguistic and trans-lational information that is available make thema valuable resource for translators, lexicogra-phers as well as terminologists.
They constitutethe nucleus of example-based machine transla-tion and translation memory systems.Another field of interest is the constitution ofmultilingual lexical databases such as the projectplanned by the European Commission's JointResearch Centre (JRC) or the more establishedPapillon project.
Multilingual lexical databasesare databases for structured lexical data whichcan be used either by humans (e.g.
to define theirown dictionaries) or by natural language process-ing (NLP) applications.Parallel corpora are freely available for re-search purposes and their increasing size de-mands the exploration of automatic methods.The ?Acquis Communautaire?
(AC) Corpus issuch a corpus.
Many research teams are involvedin the JRC project for the enrichment of a multi-lingual lexical database.
The aim of the project isto reach an automatic extraction of lexical tuplesfrom the AC Corpus.The AC document collection was constitutedwhen ten new countries joined the European Un-ion in 2004.
They had to translate an existingcollection of about ten thousand legal documentscovering a large variety of subject areas.
The?Acquis Communautaire?
Corpus exists as a par-allel text in 20 languages.
The JRC has collectedlarge parts of this document collection, has con-verted it to XML, and provide sentence align-ments for most language pairs (Steinberger et al,2006).1.2 Alignment approachesAlignment becomes an important issue for researchon bilingual and multilingual corpora.
Existing align-ment methods define a continuum going from purelystatistical methods to linguistic ones.
A major point ofdivergence is the granularity of the proposed align-ments (entire texts, paragraphs, sentences, clauses,words) which often depends on the application.In a coarse-grained alignment task, punctuation orformatting can be sufficient.
At finer-grained levels,methods are more sophisticated and combine linguis-tic clues with statistical ones.
Statistical alignmentmethods at sentence level have been thoroughlyinvestigated (Gale & Church, 1991a/ 1991b ; Brownet al, 1991 ; Kay & R?scheisen, 1993).
Others usevarious linguistic information (Simard et al, 1992 ;Papageorgiou et al, 1994).
Purely statisticalalignment methods are proposed at word level (Gale& Church, 1991a ; Kitamura & Matsumoto, 1995).
(Tiedemann, 1993 ; Boutsis & Piperidis, 1996 ;Piperidis et al, 1997) combine statistical andlinguistic information for the same task.
Somemethods make alignment suggestions at anintermediate level between sentence and word271and word (Smadja, 1992 ; Smadja et al, 1996 ;Kupiec, 1993 ; Kumano & Hirakawa, 1994 ; Boutsis& Piperidis, 1998).A common problem is the delimitation and spot-ting of the units to be matched.
This is not a real prob-lem for methods aiming at alignments at a high levelof granularity (paragraphs, sentences) where unit de-limiters are clear.
It becomes more difficult for lowerlevels of granularity (Simard, 2003), where corre-spondences between graphically delimited words arenot always satisfactory.2 The multi-grained endogenous align-ment approachThe approach proposed here deals with the spot-ting of multi-grained translation equivalents.
Wedo not adopt very rigid constraints concerningthe size of linguistic units involved, in order toaccount for the flexibility of language and trans-lation divergences.
Alignment links can then beestablished at various levels, from sentences towords and obeying no other constraints than themaximum size of candidate alignment sequencesand their minimum frequency of occurrence.The approach is endogenous since the input isused as the only used linguistic resource.
It is themultilingual parallel AC corpus itself.
It does notcontain any syntactical annotation, and the textshave not been lemmatised.
In this approach, noclassical linguistic resources are required.
Theinput texts have been segmented and aligned atsentence level by the JRC.
Inflectional divergen-cies of isolated words are taken into accountwithout external linguistic information (lexicon)and without linguistic parsers (stemmer or tag-ger).
The morphology is learnt automatically us-ing an endogenous parsing module integrated inthe alignment tool based on (D?jean, 1998).We adopt a minimalist approach, in the line ofGREYC.
In the JRC project, many languages donot have available linguistic resources for auto-matic processing, neither inflectional or syntacti-cal annotation, nor surface syntactic analysis orlexical resources (machine-readable dictionariesetc.).
Therefore we can not use a large amount ofa priori knowledge on these languages.3 Considerations on the Corpus3.1 Corpus definitionConcretely, the texts constituting the AC cor-pus (Steinberger et al, 2006) are legal docu-ments translated in several languages and alignedat sentence level.
Here is a description of theparallel corpus, in the 20 languages available:- Czech: 7106 documents- Danish: 8223 documents- German: 8249 documents- Greek: 8003 documents- English: 8240 documents- Spanish: 8207 documents- Estonian: 7844 documents- Finnish: 8189 documents- French: 8254 documents- Hungarian: 7535 documents- Italian: 8249 documents,- Lithuanian: 7520 documents- Latvian: 7867 documents- Maltese: 6136 documents- Dutch: 8247 documents- Polish: 7768 documents- Portuguese: 8210 documents- Slovakian: 6963 documents- Slovene:7821 documents- Swedish: 8233 documentsThe documents contained in the archives areXML files, UTF-8 encoding, containing informa-tion on ?sentence?
segmentation.
Each file isstamped with a unique identifier (the celex iden-tifier).
It refers to a unique document.

refer to the <Psid=??
?> of the Czech and Danish translationsof the document 31967R0741.The current version of our alignment systemdeals with one language pair at a time, whateverthe languages are.
The algorithm takes as input acorpus of bitexts aligned at sentence level.
Usu-ally, the alignment at this level outputs alignedwindows containing from 0 to 2 segments.
One-to-one mapping corresponds to a standard output(see link types ?1-1?
above).
An empty windowcorresponds to a case of addition in the sourcelanguage or to a case of omission in the targetlanguage.
One-to-two mapping corresponds tosplit sentences (see link types ?1-2?
and ?2-1?above).Formally, each bitext is a quadruple < T1, T2,Fs, C> where T1 and T2 are the two texts, Fs isthe function that reduces T1 to an element setFs(T1) and also reduces T2 to an element setFs(T2), and C is a subset of the Cartesian productof Fs(T1) x Fs(T2) (Harris, 1988).Different standards define the encoding ofparallel text alignments.
Our system nativelyhandles TMX and XCES format, with UTF-8 orUTF-16 encoding.4 The Resolution MethodThe resolution method is composed of twostages, based on two underlying hypotheses.
Thefirst stage handles the document grain.
The sec-ond stage handles the corpus grain.4.1 Hypotheseshypothesis 1 : let?s consider a bitext composedof the texts T1 and T2.
If a sequence S1 is re-peated several times in T1 and in well-definedsentences 1 , there are many chances that a re-peated sequence S2 corresponding to the transla-tion of S1 occurs in the corresponding alignedsentences in T2.hypothesis 2 : let?s consider a corpus of bitexts,composed of two languages L1 and L2.
There isno guarantee for a sequence S1 which is repeatedin many texts of language L1 to have a uniquetranslation in the corresponding texts of languageL2.4.2 Stage 1 : Bitext analysisThe first stage handles the document scale.
Thusit is applied on each document, individually.There is no interaction at the corpus level.Determining the multi-grained sequences tobe alignedFirst, we consider the two languages of thedocument independently, the source language L1and the target language L2.
For each language,we compute the repeated sequences as well astheir frequency.The algorithm based on suffix arrays does notretain the sub-sequences of a repeated sequenceif they are as frequent as the sequence itself.
Forinstance, if ?subjects?
appears with the same fre-quency than ?healthy subjects?
we retain onlythe second sequence.
On the contrary, if ?dis-ease?
occurs more frequently than ?thyroid dis-ease?
we retain both.1 Here, ?
sentences ?
can be generalized as ?
textualsegments ?273When computing the frequency of a repeatedsequence, the offset of each occurrence is memo-rized.
So the output of this processing stage is alist of sequences with their frequency and theoffset list in the document.
?thyroid cancer?
: list of segments where the sequenceappears45, 46, 46, 48, 51, 51, ?Handling inflectionsInflectional divergencies of isolated words aretaken into account without external linguisticinformation (lexicon) and without linguisticparsers (stemmer or tagger).
The morphology islearnt automatically using an endogenous ap-proach derived from (D?jean, 1998).
The algo-rithm is reversible: it allows to compute prefixesthe same way, with reversed word list as input.The basic idea is to approximate the borderbetween the nucleus and the suffixes.
The bordermatches the position where the number of dis-tinct letters preceding a suffix of length n isgreater than the number of distinct letters preced-ing a suffix of length n-1.For instance, in the first English document ofour corpus, ?g?
is preceded by 4 distinct letters,?ng?
by 2 and ?ing?
by 10: ?ing?
is probably asuffix.
In the first Greek document, ???
is pre-ceded by 5 letters, ????
by 1 and ?????
by 10.?????
is probably a suffix.The algorithm can generate some wrong mor-phemes, from a strictly linguistic point of view.But at this stage, no filtering is done in order tocheck their validity.
We let the alignment algo-rithm do the job with the help of contextual in-formation.Vectorial representation of the sequencesAn orthonormal space is then considered in orderto explore the existence of possible translationrelations between the sequences, and in order todefine translation couples.
The existence oftranslation relations between sequences is ap-proximated by the cosine of vectors associated tothem, in this space.The links in the alignment file allow the con-struction of this orthonormal space.
This spacehas no dimensions, where no is the number ofnon-empty links.
Alignment links with emptysets (type="0-?"
or type="?-0") corresponds to casesof omission or addition in one language.Every repeated sequence is seen as a vector inthis space.
For the construction of this vector, wefirst pick up the segment offset in the documentfor each repeated sequence.
?thyroid cancer?
: list of segments where the sequenceappears45, 46, 46, 48, 51, 51Then we convert this list in a nL-dimension vec-tor vL, where nL is the number of textual seg-ments of the document of language L. Each di-mension contains the number of occurrences pre-sent in the segment.
?thyroid cancer?
: associated with a vector of nL di-mensions.1 2 ?
45 46 47 48 49 50 51 ?
nL0 0  1 2 0 1 0 0 2  0With the help of the alignment file, we can nowmake the projection of the vector vL in the no-dimension vector vo.
For instance, if the link <linktype="2-1" xtargets="45 46;45" /> is located at rankr=40 in the alignment file and if English is thefirst language (L=en), then vo[40] = ven[45] +ven[46].Sequence alignmentFor each sequence of L1 to be aligned, we lookfor the existence of a translation relation betweenit and every L2 sequence to be aligned.
The exis-tence of a translation relation between two se-quences is approximated by the cosine of thevectors associated to them.The cosine is a mathematical tool used in inNatural Language Processing for various pur-poses, e.g.
(Roy & Beust, 2004) uses the cosinefor thematic categorisation of texts.
The cosine isobtained by dividing the scalar product of twovectors with the product of their norms.????
?=22),cos(iiiiiiyxyxyxWe note that the cosine is never negative as vec-tors coordinates are always positive.
The se-quences proposed for the alignment are thosethat obtain the largest cosine.
We do not proposean alignment if the best cosine is inferior to acertain threshold.4.3 Stage 2 : Corpus managementThe second stage handles the corpus grain andmerges the information found at document grain,in the first stage.Handling the Corpus DimensionThe bitext corpus is not a bag of aligned sen-tences and is not considered as if it were.
It is abag of bitexts, each bitext containing a bag ofaligned sentences.274Considering the bitext level (or documentgrain) is useful for several reasons.
First, for op-erational sake.
The greedy algorithm for repeatedsequence extraction has a cubic complexity.
It isbetter to apply it on the document unit ratherthan on the corpus unit.
But this is not the mainreason.Second, the alignment algorithm between se-quences relies on the principle of translation co-herence: a repeated sequence in L1 has manychances to be translated by the same sequence inL2 in the same text.
This hypothesis holds insidethe document but not in the corpus: a polysemicterm can be translated in different ways accord-ing to the document genre or domain.Third, the confidence in the generated align-ments is improved if the results obtained by theexecution of the process on several documentsshare compatible alignments.Alignment Filtering and RankingThe filtering process accepts terms which havebeen produced (1) by the execution on at leasttwo documents, (2) by the execution on solelyone document if the aligned terms correspond tothe same character string or if the frequency ofthe terms is greater than an empirical thresholdfunction.
This threshold is  proportional to theinverse term length since there are fewer com-plex repeated terms than simple terms.The ranking process sorts candidates using theproduct of the term frequency by the number ofoutput agreements.5 ResultsThe results concern an alignment task betweenEnglish and the 19 other languages of the AC-Corpus.
For each language pair, we considered500 bitexts of the AC Corpus.
We join in an-nexes A, B, and C some sample of this results.Annex A deals with English-French paralleltexts, Annex B deals with English-Spanish paral-lel texts and finally Annex C deals with English-German ones.
We discuss in the following linesof the English-French alignment.Among the correct alignments, we find do-main dependant lexical terms:- legal terms of the EEC (EEC initial verifi-cation /v?rification primitive CEE,  Regula-tion (EEC) No/r?glement (CEE) n?
),- specialty terms (rear-view mirrors / r?tro-viseurs, poultry/volaille).We also find invariant terms (km/h/km/h, kg/kg,mortem/mortem).We encounter alignments at different grain:territory/territoire  Member States/?tats membres,Whereas/Consid?rant que,   fresh poultrymeat/viandesfra?ches de volaille,  Having regard to the Opinion ofthe/vu l?avis.The wrong alignments mainly come from can-didates that have not been confirmed by runningon several documents (column ndoc=1): on/lacommercialisation des.A permanent dedicated web site will be openin March 2006 to detail all the results for eachlanguage pair.
The URL ishttp://users.info.unicaen.fr/~giguet/alignment.5.1 DiscussionFirst, the results are similar to those obtained onthe Greek/English scientific corpus.Second, it is sometimes difficult to choose be-tween distinct proposals for a same term whenthe grain vary:  Member/membre~  MemberState~/membre~   Member States/?tats membresState/membre State~/membre~.
There is a prob-lem both in the definition of terms and in theability of an automatic process to choose be-tween the components of the terms.Third, thematic terms of the corpus are not al-ways aligned, since they are not repeated.
Core-fence is used instead, thanks to nominal anaph-ora, acronyms, and also lexical reductions.
Accu-racy depends on the document domain.
In themedical domain, acronyms are aligned but nottheir expansion.
However, we consider that thisproblem has to be solved by an anaphora resolu-tion system, not by this alignment algorithm.6 ConclusionWe showed that it is possible to contribute to theprocessing of languages for which few linguisticresources are available.
We propose a solution tothe spotting of multi-grained translation fromparallel corpora.
The results are surprisinglygood and encourage us to improve the method, inorder to reach a semi-automatic construction of amultilingual lexical database.The endogenous approach allows to handle in-flectional variations.
We also show the impor-tance of using the proper knowledge at theproper level (sentence grain, document grain andcorpus grain).
An improvement would be to cal-culate inflectional variations at corpus grainrather than at document grain.
Therefore, it ispossible to plug any external and exogenouscomponent in our architecture to improve theoverall quality.275The size of this ?massive compilation?
(wework with a 20 languages corpora) implies thedesign of specific strategies in order to handle itproperly and quite efficiently.
Special effortshave been done in order to manage the AC Cor-pus from our document management platform,WIMS.The next improvement is to precisely evaluatethe system.
Another perspective is to integrate anendogenous coreference solver (Giguet & Lucas,2004).ReferencesAltenberg B.
