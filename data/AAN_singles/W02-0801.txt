The coreof the method is to find translations ofthe occurrence of the target prepositionor case suffix, and assign theintersection of their set ofinterpretations.
Given a table withprepositions and their possibleinterpretations, the method is fullyautomatic.
We have tested this methodon the occurrences of the Basqueinstrumental case -z in the definitions ofa Basque dictionary, looking for thetranslations in the definitions from 3Spanish and 3 English dictionaries.
Theresults have been that we are able todisambiguate with 94.5% accuracy2.3% of those occurrences (up to 91).The ambiguity is reduced from 7readings down to 3.1.
The results arevery encouraging given the simpletechniques used, and show greatpotential for improvement.1 IntroductionThis paper presents some preliminary experimentsin the use of translation equivalences todisambiguate the interpretations of case suffixes inBasque.
Basque is an agglutinative language, andits case suffixes are more or less equivalent toprepositions, but are also used to mark the subjectand objects of verbs.
The method is general, andcould be as easily applied to prepositions in anyother language.
The core of the method is to find apreposition in the translation of an occurrence ofthe target case suffix, and select theinterpretation(s) in the intersection of both as thevalid interpretation(s).
At this point, we have notused additional sources for the disambiguation,e.g.
governing verbs, nouns, etc., but they couldcomplement the technique here presented.In this particular experiment, the method wastested on the definitions of a Basque monolingualdictionary, using the -z instrumental as the targetcase suffix.
The main reason is that we are in theprocess of building a Lexical Knowledge Base outof dictionary definitions, and the disambiguationof case suffixes and other semantic dependenciesis of great interest.The method searches for the respectivedefinitions in English and Spanish monolingualdictionaries and tries to find a preposition that isthe translation of the target case suffix.
Once thepreposition is found, the intersection of the set ofinterpretations of both the source case suffix andthe translated preposition is taken, and theoutcome is stored.The resources needed to perform this task arethe following: lemmatizers, bilingual dictionariesand monolingual dictionaries, as well as a table ofpossible interpretations of prepositions and casesuffixes.
In our case, we have used Basque,English and Spanish lemmatizers, Basque/Englishand Basque/Spanish bilingual dictionaries, a targetBasque monolingual dictionary, 3 Spanish and 3English monolingual dictionaries.The method is fully automatic; the Spanish andEnglish monolingual dictionaries are accessedfrom the Internet, and the rest are local, installedin our machines.
The manual work has been tobuild the table with possible interpretations of theprepositions and case suffixes.July 2002, pp.

Association for Computational Linguistics.Disambiguation: Recent Successes and Future Directions, Philadelphia,Proceedings of the SIGLEX/SENSEVAL Workshop on Word SenseThe paper is structured as follows.
Section 2presents the method for disambiguation in detail.Section 3 introduces the interpretations for thecase suffix and the prepositions.
The results areshown in Section 4, which are further discussed inSection 5.
Finally, section 6 presents theconclusions and future work.2 Method for disambiguationThe goal of the method is to disambiguatebetween the possible interpretations of a casesuffix appearing in any text.
We have taken as thetarget text the definitions from a monolingualBasque dictionary Euskal Hiztegia, EH in short(Sarasola, 1996).
The method consists on fivesteps:?
Extraction of the definitions in EH where thetarget case suffix occurs.?
Search of on-line Spanish and Englishdictionaries to obtain the translationequivalent of the definitions.?
Extraction of the target preposition from thetranslation definitions.?
Disambiguation based on the intersection ofthe interpretations of case suffix andprepositions.We will explain each step in turn.2.1 Extraction of relations from EHGiven a case suffix, in this step we will search theEH dictionary for occurrences of the case suffix.We first lemmatize and perform morphologicalanalysis of the definitions (Aduriz et.
al, 1996).The definitions that contain the target case suffixin a morphological analysis are extracted, storingthe following information: the Basque dictionaryentry of the definition, the lemma that has the casesuffix, the case suffix, and the following lemma.Below we can see a sample definition, itslemmatized version, and the two triples extractedfrom this definition.
The occurrences of theinstrumental -z are shown in bold.Ildo iz.
A1 Goldeaz lurra iraulizegiten den irekidura luzea11 The literal translation of the definition is thefollowing : furrow, a long trench produced turning/<@@lema ildo>/<ID>//<@@Adiera_string A1.>/<ID>//<@@Kategoria iz.

section 5.1).For instance, the first triple should rather be thedependency golde#INS#irauli (plow#with#turn, tobe read in reverse order).
We will see that even inthis case we will be able to obtain correcttranslations and disambiguate the prepositioncorrectly.
Nevertheless, in the future we plan touse a syntactic parser to identify better the lemmasthat are related by the case suffix.2.2 Search for Spanish/EnglishtranslationsAfter we have a list of entries in the Basquedictionary that contain the lemma-suffix-lemmatriple, we search for their equivalent definitions inSpanish and English.
We first look up the entry inthe bilingual dictionary, and then retrieve theover the ground with a plow.2 The translation of the first triple is plow#with#ground,to be read on reverse.
The translation of the second isturn#NULL#produce, to be also read on reverse.
In thissecond triple the instrumental case suffix is nottranslated explicitly by a preposition, but by a syntacticconstruct.definitions for each of the possible translationsfrom the monolingual dictionaries.We use two bilingual and 6 monolingualMachine Readable Dictionaries: MorrisBasque/English dictionary (Morris, 1998) ElhuyarBasque/Spanish dictionary (Elhuyar, 1996);English monolingual on-line dictionaries are:Cambridge (online), Heritage (online), andWordsmyth (online); and Spanish monolingualon-line dictionaries are: Colmex (online), Rae(online), and Vox (online).
The Basque dictionaryand the bilingual dictionaries are stored in a localserver, while the monolingual dictionaries areaccessed from the Internet using a wrapper.The incomplete list of the translation of ildo(furrow in English, surco in Spanish) is shownbelow.
Note that we got two different definitionsfor surco, coming from different Spanishdictionaries.furrow#A long , narrow , shallowtrench made in the ground by aplowsurco#Excavaci?n alargada , angosta ypoco profunda que se haceparalelamente en la tierra con elarado , para sembrarla despu?ssurco#Hendedura que se hace en latierra con el arado2.3 Extraction of Spanish/Englishequivalent relationsGiven a list of definitions in Spanish and English,we search in the definition the translation of theBasque triple found in step 2.1, that is, we look fora triple of consecutive words where the first wordis the translation of the last word in the Basquetriple, the second word is a preposition (whichcorresponds to the Basque suffix) and the thirdword is the translation of the first word in theBasque triple.
Between the preposition and the lastword in the triple we allow for the presence of adeterminer or an adjective in the text.
Morecomplex patterns could be allowed, up to fullsyntactic analyses, but at this point we follow thissimple scheme.Below we can find the triples forgolde#INS#lur, obtained from the three definitionsabove.
One triple is obtained twice from twodifferent definitions.furrow#ground#by#plowsurco#tierra#con#aradosurco#tierra#con#aradoDefinitions that do not have a matching tripleare discarded, leaving Basque triples withoutmatching triple ambiguous.
For instance we couldnot find triples for irauli#INS#egin(cf.
example insection 2.1).
The instrumental suffix is sometimestranslated without prepositions (in this case ?
?made turning ??
).Looking up the bilingual dictionaries fortranslation requires lemmatization and Part ofSpeech tagging.
For English we use the TnT PoStagger (Brants, 2000) and WordNet forlemmatization (Miller et al, 1990).
For Spanishwe use (Atserias et al, 1998).2.4 DisambiguationFor each Basque case suffix, Spanish prepositionand English preposition we have a list ofinterpretations (cf.
Table 1).
We assign theinterpretations of the preposition to eachSpanish/English triple.
The intersection of all theinterpretations is assigned to it.Continuing with out example, we can see thatthe intersection between the interpretations of theEnglish by preposition (three interpretations) andthe interpretations of the Spanish con preposition(four interpretations) are manner and instrument.Therefore, we can say that the Basqueinstrumental case interpretation in this case willbe manner or instrument.furrow#ground#by a#plow#manner instrument during-timesurco#tierra#con el#arado#manner instrument cause containinggolde#INS#lur#instrument manner3 Interpretations for theinstrumental case suffix andequivalent prepositionsThe method explained in the previous section isfully automatic, and it only requires the list ofinterpretations for each case suffix andpreposition.
In this work, we want to evaluate ifthe overall approach is feasible, so we selectedBasque as the target language and a single casesuffix, -z the instrumental case.
Table 1 shows thelist of possible interpretations and Table 2 and 3examples for each interpretation.The sources for the interpretations of theinstrumental case have been a grammar of Basque(Euskaltzaindia, 1985) and a bilingual dictionary(Elhuyar, 1996).
Possible interpretations forSpanish and English prepositions have been takenfrom an English dictionary (Cambridge, online), aSpanish dictionary (Vox, online) and a Spanishgrammar (Bosque & Demonte, 1999).For this work we have taken a descriptiveapproach, but other more theoretically committedapproaches are also possible.
The overall methodis independent of the set of interpretations, as itonly needs a table of possible interpretations in thestyle of Table 1.
Section 5.4 further discussesother alternatives.In order to disambiguate the occurrences of theinstrumental case suffix we have taken theSpanish and English translations for this casesuffix.
The list of possible translations ispreliminary and covers what we found necessaryto make this experiment.
Table 1 shows the list ofprepositions and interpretations for Spanish andEnglish.
Examples of the interpretations can befound in Table 2.
The Spanish preposition de hadthe same interpretations as the instrumental casesuffix (cf.
Table1), so it was discarded.4 ResultsThe instrumental case occurs in 4,004 differentdefinitions in the EH dictionary.
The algorithm inSection 2 was applied to all these definitions,yielding a result for 125 triples, 3.1% of the total.The triples for which we had an answer weretagged by hand independently, i.e.
not consultingthe results output by the algorithm.
The hand-tagged set constitutes what we call the goldstandard.A single linguist made the tagging, consultingother teammates when in doubt.
Apart frommarking the interpretation, there were some otherspecial cases.1.
In some of the examples, the instrumentalcase was part of a more complex scheme, andwas tagged accordingly:?
Part of a postposition (XPOST), e.g.
-enbidez (by means of) or -en ordez (insteadof).?
Part of a conjunction (XLOK), e.g.
batezere (specially).?
Part of a compounded suffix ?zko(XZKO), which results from theaggregation of the instrumental ?z  withthe location genitive -ko.2.
There were three errors in the lemmatizationprocess (XLEM), due to lexicalized items, e.g.gizonezko (meaning male person).3.
Finally, the relation in the definition wassometimes wrongly retrieved, e.g.?
The triple would contain the determiner oran adjective instead of the dependencies.We thought that the algorithm would beable to work well even with those cases,so we decided to keep them.?
The triple contains a conjunction (X):these were tagged as incorrect.Table 4 shows the amount of such cases,alongside the frequency of each interpretation.The most frequent interpretation is instrument.
Inseven examples, the linguist decided to keep twointerpretations: instrument and manner.
In a singleexample, the linguist was unable to select aninterpretation, so this example was discarded.The output of the algorithm was comparedwith the gold standard, yielding the accuracyfigures in Table 5.
An output was consideredcorrect if it yielded at least one interpretation incommon with the gold standard.
The accuracy isgiven for each dictionary in isolation, or mergingall the results (as mentioned in section 2, whentwo dictionaries propose interpretations for thesame triple, their intersection is taken).
Theremaining ambiguity is 3.1 overall.Basque English Spanish-z (ins.)

The accuracy of thisbaseline is practically equal to that of thealgorithm.
Note that the frequency is computed onthe same sample where it is applied, yieldingbetter results than it should.5 DiscussionThe obtained results show a very good accuracy,leaving a remaining ambiguity of 3.1 results perexample.
This means that we were able to discardan average of 4 readings for each of the examples,introducing only 5.5% of error.
The results arepractically equal to the most frequent baseline,which is usually hard to beat using knowledge-based techniques.Coverage of the method is very low, only2.3%, but this was not an issue for us, as we planto couple this method with other MachineLearning techniques in a bootstrappingframework.
Nevertheless, we are still interested inincreasing the coverage, in order to obtain moretraining data.Next, we will analyze more in depth the causesof the low coverage, the sources of the errors andambiguity and the interpretations of case suffixesand prepositions.5.1 Sources of low coverageAs soon as we started devising this method, it wasclear to us that the coverage will be rather low.The main reason is that different dictionaries tendto give different details in their definitions, or usediffering paraphrases.
This fact is intrinsic to ourmethod, and accounts for the large majority ofmissing answers.On the other hand, the simple method used tofind triples means that a change in the order of thecomplements will cause our method to faillooking for a translation triple.
Syntactic analysis,even shallow parsing methods, will help increasethe coverage.Another source of discarded triples are thecases where the suffix is not translated by apreposition, e.g.
the relation is carried out by asubject or direct object.

This is a strong reduction but wewould like to make it even smaller.We plan to study which is the source of theresidual ambiguity.
Alternative sets ofinterpretations (cf.
Section 5.4) with coarsergrained differences and smaller ambiguity, couldyield better results.
Another alternative is toexplore more infrequent translations of the casesuffixes, which might yield a narrower overlap.This is the case for the instrumental case suffixbeing translated with from, up, etc.5.4 Interpretations of case suffixes andprepositionsDifferent authors give differing interpretations forprepositions.
It has been our choice to take adescriptive list of possible interpretations from aset of sources, mainly dictionaries and grammarbooks.This work covers only the instrumental casesuffix and its translations to English and Spanish.If tables for all case suffixes and prepositions werebuilt, the method could be applied to all casesuffixes and prepositions, yielding disambiguatedrelations in all three languages.More theoretically committed lists ofinterpretations (Dorr et al, 1998; Civit et al,2000; Sowa, 2000) should also be considered, butunfortunately we have not found a full account forall prepositions.
If such a full table ofinterpretations existed, it could be very easy toapply our method, and obtain the outcome interms of these other interpretations.6 Conclusion and further workThis paper presents preliminary experiments in theuse of translation equivalences to disambiguateprepositions or case suffixes.
The core of themethod is to find translations of the occurrence ofthe target preposition or case suffix, and assign theintersection of their set of interpretations.
Themethod is fully automatic, given a table withprepositions and their possible interpretations.We have tested this method on the occurrencesof the Basque instrumental case -z in thedefinitions of a Basque dictionary.
We havesearched the translations in the definitions from 3Spanish and 3 English dictionaries.The results have been that we are able todisambiguate with 94.5% accuracy 2.3% of thoseoccurrences (up to 91).
The ambiguity is reducedfrom 7 readings down to 3.1.
We think that theseare very good results, especially seeing that thereis room for improvement.More specifically, we plan to apply surfacesyntactic analysis to better extract the dependencyrelations, which is the main source of errors.
Wewould like to study other inventories ofpreposition interpretations, both in order to havebetter theoretical foundations as well as toinvestigate whether coarser grained distinctionswould lead to a reduction in the ambiguity.In the future, we plan to explore the possibilityto feed a Machine Learning algorithm with theautomatically disambiguated examples, in order toconstruct a full-fledged disambiguation algorithmfollowing a bootstrapping approach.
On the otherhand, we would like to apply the method to the setof all prepositions and case suffixes, and beyondthat to all syntactic dependencies.
The results willbe directly loaded in a Lexical Knowledge Baseextracted from the Basque dictionary (Ansa et al,in prep.
).We also plan to explore whether this methodcan be applied to free running text, removing theconstraint that the translations have to bedefinitions of the equivalent word.Finally, this technique could be coupled withtechniques that make use of the semantic types ofthe words in the context.Overall, we found the results are veryencouraging given the simple techniques used,and we think that it shows great potential forimprovement and interesting avenues for research.AcknowledgmentsMikel Lersundi and David Martinez weresupported by Basque Government grants AE-BFI:98.217 and AE-BFI:01.2485.
