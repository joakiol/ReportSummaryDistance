eduAbst rac tThis paper describes how NOMLEX, a dictio-nary of nominalizations, can be used in Informa-tion Extraction (IE).
This paper details a pro-cedure which maps syntactic and semantic infor-mation designed for writing an IE pattern for anactive clause (IBM appointed Alice Smith as vicepresident) into a set of patterns for nominaliza-tions (e.g., IBM's appointment ofAlice Smith asvice president and Alice Smith's appointment asvice president).1 In t roduct ionAlthough, nominalizationQ are very common inwritten text, the computational linguistics liter-ature provides few systematic accounts of how todeal with phrases containing these words.
Thispaper focuses on this problem in the context ofInformation Extraction (IE).
2 Many extractionsystems use either parsing combined with someform of syntactic regularization, or a meta-rulemechanism to automatically match variants ofclausal syntactic structures (active main clause,passive, relative clause etc.
), e.g., FASTUS (Ap-pelt et al, 1995) and the Proteus ExtractionSystem (Grishman, 1995).
However, this mecha-nism does not extend to nominalization patterns,which must be coded separately from the clausalpatterns.
NOMLEX, a dictionary of nominal-izations currently under development at NYU,(Macleod et al, 1997) provides a way to handlenominalizations more automatically, and withINominalizations are nouns which are related towords of another part of speech, most commonly verbs.In this paper, only verbal nominalizatious will bediscussed.2The Message Understanding Colfference ScenarioTemplate Task (MUC, 1995), (MUC, 1998) is ore" modelfor the kind of information that we are attempting to ex-tract (who does what to whom, and when and where).25greater coverage.
NOMLEX includes informa-tion about mappings between verbs and nomi-nalizations that will help generalize informationfrom verbal patterns to create nominalizationpatterns.
This paper describes the structureof the dictionary and a procedure for creatingnominalization patterns.
This procedure takesinto account lexical information about nominal-izations which is encoded in NOMLEX.The Proteus Extraction System starts with asemantic pattern for an active clause:np(C-company) vg(appoint) np(C-person) "as"np(C-position)which matches a clause beginning with a nounphrase headed by a noun of type COMPANY,followed by a verb group (verb plus auxilliaries)headed by appoint, a noun phrase headed bya noun of type PERSON, the literal as, and anoun phrase headed by a noun of type position,e.g., IBM appointed Alice Smith as vice presi-dent.
Proteus applies meta-rules to this patternto produce new patterns for other clausal types,e.g., a passive clause:np(C-person) vg-pass(appoint) "as"np(C-position) "by" np(C-company)(vg-pass is a passive verb group).
This new pat-tern would match Alice Smith was appointed asvice president by IBM.
When a pattern matchesinput text, the pieces of the text correspondingto the constituents of the pattern are used tobuild a semantic representation f the text.To avoid the need for having users code suchpatterns, we have developed the Proteus Ex-traction Tool (PET) (Yangarber and Grishman,1997).
PET allows the user to input an examplesentence and specify the mappings from syntac-tic to semantic form.
The system then producesgeneralized patterns to perform these mappings.This paper shows how PET can use NOMLEXto create nominalization patterns as well.
For ex-ample, given the sentence IBM appointed AliceSmith as vice president, human input and dictio-nary entries identify IBM as the employer, AliceSmith as the employee, and vice president as theposition.
The meta-rules add a slot for tempo-ral PPs which state the date (e.g., on June 1,1998).
PET creates patterns to fill the seman-tic slots (employer, employee, position) from thegramatical roles (subject, object, NP followingas, etc.)
in the sentence.
PET generates pat-terns to cover passive sentences, active sentencesand relative clauses.
Enhanced with NOMLEX,PET can also cover examples like Alice Smith'sappointment as vice president; IBM's June 1,1998 appointment of Alice Smith; and the June1, 1998 appointment ofAlice Smith by IBM.
Thecorrespondence b tween ominal and verbal po-sitions is determined by explicit information inthe NOMLEX dictionary entry and by generallinguistic constraints.2 Cons iderat ions  for  Choos ing  aD ic t ionary  Encod ingThe primary information in a NOMLEX en-try is a description of a nominalizatiou's ar-gument structure.
This information can bequite complex.
There are several potential ar-gument positions, including both pre-nominal(the bomb ezplosion, the bomb's explosion) andpost-nominal (the ezplosion of the bomb), anda given verbal argument may appear in one ofseveral positions.
3 In general, individual argu-ments may be omitted, although there are someco-occurrence constraints, which we shall con-sider below.
Furthermore, vhether or not oneposition is filled may affect the interpretationof other positions; thus, in Rome's destruction,Rome is the object, whereas in Rome's destruc-tion of Carthage, Rome is the subject.In seeking an appropriate representation forSThese positions may be filled by non-arguments awell.
For example, the prenominal positions may be filledby temporal NPs (NTIME1 and NTIME2 in COMLEX)like Yesterday(but not John), e.g., Yesterday's appoint-ment of the Prime Minister and The June I, 1987 ap-pointment of the Prime Minister.
These positions corre-spond to temporal modifiers of clauses, e.g., .\" appointedthe Prime Minister Yesterday/June I, 1987.
For furtherdiscussion, see Section 5.26this information, one can compare the situationwith that of English verbal complements, whichhave been extensively studied and recorded.
InEnglish, verbal complements are relatively fixedin composition and order.
As a result, the com-mon practice (adopted, for example, in OALD(Hornby, 1980), LDOCE (Proctor, 1978), andCOMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al, forthcoming)is to enumerate and name the possible subcat-egorizations, where in general each subcatego-rization represents a fixed sequence of syntacticelements.
4 For example, in COMLEX (Wolff etal., 1994), NP-PP consists of a Noun Phrase fol-lowed by a Prepositional Phrase as in put themilk in the refrigerator, where *put the milk,*put in the refrigerator and *put in the refrig-erator the milk are not acceptable.
Such an ap-proach would be unwieldy for nominalizations,where an argument may appear in several posi-tions and may also be omitted.
As a result, evena simple nominatization may entail a large num-ber of subcategorization frames.
If these werelisted explicitly, the entry would be difficult tocreate and to read.On the other hand, a representation whichseparately listed all the complement structureswhich could occur with a nominalization, as-suming they could freely co-occur, would failto capture many crucial constraints betweencomplements.
For example, the nominaliza-tion confirmation has both THAT-S (His con-firmation THAT HE WOULD GO) and WH-Scomplements (His confirmation of WHETHERHE WOULD GO.).
However, these com-plements cannot co-occur (*His confirmationTHAT HE WOULD GO of WHETHER HEIVOULD GO.).
Also in the case where the asso-ciated verb has an NP-AS-NP complement (Shetreated them as inferiors) and no AS-NP comple-ment (She emerged as their main competitor) thenominalization cannot have a bare AS-NP.
Thuswe have The consideration of HIM AS A CAN-DIDATE and HIS consideration AS A CANDI-DATE but not *The consideration AS A CAN-DIDATE.Guided by these considerations, we chose anapproach in which we first determine whichCOMLEX verbal complements can correspond4 In COMLEX Syntax, some symbols designate sets ofalternative complement s ructures, e.g., the ditransitivealternation.to phrases containing nominalizations and thenwe specify how these complements can bemapped to arguments of the nominalizations.The resulting COMLEX-based encoding doesnot permit incompatible complement phrases toco-occur, e.g., confirmation would not simulta-neously take both THAT-S and WH-S comple-ments.
Optionality, obligatoriness and alterna-tive positions of phrases is stated in a simplenotation, e.g., it can be stated in the entry forconsideration that the verbal object for the NP-AS-NP complement of consider maps to eitherthe DET-POSS position (HIS consideration as acandidate) or the PP-OF position (The consid-eration OF HIM as a candidate) and that thisobject is obligatory for mappings of NP-AS-NP,i.e., if the object is not present in the phrasecontaining consideration, then the phrase can-not be mapped to the NP-AS-NP complement,although other complements are possible.Our representation also accounts for the dif-ference in behavior of the core arguments (thesubject, the object, and the indirect object) andthe other arguments, which we shall refer to asoblique complements.
The core arguments, aswe have noted, can appear in several positionsin the nominalization, and may be independentlyomitted or included.
The oblique complementsof the verb, on the other hand, generally translatedirectly into nominalization complements, eitherunchanged or occasionally with the addition of apreposition or a "that" complementizer.3 What  is a NOMLEX Ent ryNOMLEX entries are organized as typed fea-ture structures and written in a Lisp-like no-tation (Figures 1 and 2).
Each entry lists thenominalization (:ORTH) and the associated verb(:VERB).
The :NOM-TYPE feature specifies thetype of nominalization: VERB-NOM for nomi-nalizations which represent the action (destruc-tion) or state (knowledge) of the associated verb;VERB-PART for nominalizations which incor-porate a verbal particle (takeover); SUBJECTfor nominalizations which represent the subjectof the verb (teacher), and OBJECT for nom-inalizations which represent he object of theverb (appointee).
The :NOUN keyword includesinformation about whether the word has non-nominalization oun senses (and may includesome frequency information).
For example, ap-27pointment has a sense which means somethinglike "date to do something".
We are only inter-ested in the nominalization sense in this paper.
5The heart of the entry is a list of verb subcat-egorizations, :VERB-SUBC, taken from COM-LEX Syntax.
The name for each subcatego-rization is prefixed by NOM- (such as NOM-NP or NOM-NP-AS-NP) and, for subcatego-rizations involving prepositions, :PVAL specifiesthose prepositions.
The COMLEX complementsin these lexical entries include:?
NP, a noun phrase complement, e.g., IBMappointed Mary?
NP-PP, a complement consisting of a nounphrase and prepositional phrase, e.g., IBMappointed Mary for the vice presidency?
NP-TO-INF-OC, a complement consistingof a noun phrase object and an infinitiveclause, where the subject of the infinitivecorresponds to the object of the main clause,e.g., IBM appointed Mary to do the job?
NP-AS-NP, a complement consisting of anoun phrase object, the word "as" and asecond noun phrase, e.g., IBM appointedMary as vice presidentFor each verb complement, the entry lists the as-sociated nominalized structure, if different fromthe verbal complement.
The entry also lists thepositions in which the object (:OBJECT) mayappear.
For appointment, these positions includethe following for most complements:?
DET-POSS, a possessive determiner, e.g.,Alice Smith's appointment asvice president?
N-N-MOD, a nominal prenominal modifier,e.g., the Alice Smith appointment for vicepresident?
PP-OF, object of the preposition of, e.g.,the appointment off Alice SmithSWhen two or more argument positions are frilled, thesemantic lasses of the arguments in the examples l imitour patterns to the nominalization senses.
However, pat-terns in which only one argmnent position is filled maymatch phrases that are ambiguous, e.g., Alice's appoint-ment can refer to either a dental appointment or an ap-pointment o the vice presidency.
These cases are han-dled by other modules of Proteus, such as inference rulesor reference resolution.

The :OBJECT is notindicated for the :VERB-SUBC of appointee be-cause the nominalization itself corresponds totheverbal object (it is :NOM-TYPE ((OBJECT))).Because a subject argument can appear withany verbal complement, we include, at the toplevel, a list of positions for the subject (:VERB-SUB J).
This list can be further restricted fora particular complement by including a :SUB-JECT feature under that complement in theNOMLEX entry.
As a default, it is assumedthat subjects always can map to prepositional byphrases.
Exceptions are marked with NOT-PP-BY, as in the entry for appointee ( *the appointeeby IBM (for vice president)).Typically, a nominalization will list multiple28positions for each core argument.
This doesn'tmean, however, that all combinations of the po-sitions are possible.
Several constraints limitthe possible role assignments; some of these con-straints are general, and some are based on par-ticular lists in each entry:?
The uniqueness constraint says that anyverbal role may only be filled once.
For ex-ample, in Leslie's appointment o/Alice, thePP-OF position filled by Alice must mapinto the object role.
As a result, Leslie can-not fill the object role and therefore mustfill the subject role.
66This constraint is based on the stratal uniquenesstheorem of (Johnson and Postal, 1980) and related workin Relational Grammar, which is assumed to be a con-straint across all languages.?
The ordering constraint says that, if thereare multiple pre-nominal modifiers, theymust appear in the order subject, object,indirect object, and oblique; thus, for ex-ample, John Smith's chool board appoint-ment cannot mean that the school boardappointed John Smith to some position, z?
Some entries contain :SUB&ATTRIBUTEand :OBJ-ATTRIBUTE features, selec-tional constraints which are useful in select-ing role assignments.
In Figures 1 and 2,the attributes COMMUNICATOR (organi-zation, person, or other entity capable ofcommunicating) and NHUMAN (a human)are used.?
Obligatoriness constraints are assumed forthe mappings associated with each com-plement in each entry.
As a default, itis assumed that only subject and objectare optional.
Therefore, Mary Smith's ap-pointment would be associated with theNOM-NP complement, but not the NOM-NP-AS-NP complement.
Furthermore, ob-jects are obligatory for a particular com-plement NP-X for a particular nominal-ization N, if N takes both NP-X andX as complements, where NP-X includesall the phrases in X plus an object (e.g.,NOM-NP vs. NOM-INTRANS, NOM-NP-PP vs. NOM-PP, NOM-NP-THAT-S vs.NOM-THAT-S, etc.).
These defaults can beoverridden in the dictionary with attributeson specific complements specifying whichroles are :OPTIONAL or :REQUIRED.
Forexample, appointment akes a NOM-NPcomplement, but no corresponding NOM-INTRANS.
The object is obligatory con-trary to our defaults, e.g., John's appoint-merit must have the interpretation that Johnis the object of appoint.
Thus, our en-try for appointment is marked :REQUIRED((OBJECT)).s4 Our  P rocedure  for  Generat ingNorn ina l i za t ion  Pat ternsFigure 3 diagrams how nominalization patternsare derived.
The rectangles are modules of our~This ordering constraint is assumed to hold for allnominalizations in English.8Our required/optional settings only apply wheresome argument is present in a nominalization.29algorithm, the ovals are data structures passedbetween modules and the dotted lines connectthe ovals with examples of what the data struc-tures might contain given the sample activeclause IBM appointed Alice Smith.
Due to spacelimitations, the figure does not include patternswith constituents for the tempOral adverbial NPpositions (Section 5), e.g., Mary Smith's June 1,1998 appointment by IBM and Yesterday's ap-pointment of Mary Smith by IBM.
There are anadditional five such mappings for appointee andan additional twenty-three for appointment.First PET analyzes the sample sentence andidentifies the main verb and its arguments (e.g.,subject, direct object, etc.).
Then it searchesNOMLEX for any nominalizations which cor-respond to the main verb.
Our example verbappoint has at least two nominalizations: ap-pointment and appointee.
Next the procedureexamines the set of :VERB-SUBC classes in eachnominalization entry (Figures 1 and 2) and iden-tifies the set of classes which are compatible withthe set of arguments in the input.
A class iscompatible if it allows all the input arguments,and none of its required arguments are missing.For the example sentence, only NOM-NP is cho-sen for each nominalization.
The other phrasesall require some phrase in addition to the ob-ject, e.g., NOM-NP-AS-NP requires an AS-NPphrase (e.g., as vice president).
Next the per-missible role mappings are generated.
By de-fault, the subject and object are optional, butthe object is obligatory for appointment due tothe :REQUIRED feature of its NOMLEX en-try.
Prepositional phrases are assumed to oc-cur ill all orders, so that both (object: of, sub-ject: by) and (subject: by, object: of) are listedin Figure 3.
The uniqueness constraint mustbe obeyed (we cannot have two subjects or twoobjects).
Finally, the syntax of noun phrasesonly permits the N-N-MOD slot to be filled morethan once (The IBM Alice Smith Appointment),and ill that case our ordering constraint wouldhave to be obeyed.
This rules out an inter-pretation of The Alice Smith IBM Appointmentwhere Alice Smith is the appointee and IBM isthe appointer.
99Given a clausal pattern for an example sentencelike They appointed Alice Smith to IBM, the NOM-NP-PP class would be matched and nominalization patternswould be generated in which IBM (the indirect object)S   .

Using pattern matching and dictionarylook-up, PET associates the verbal argumentswith semantic classes.
In our example, the sub-ject is a company and the objec t is a person.This information can be applied to each map-ping to produce a pattern.
The nominalizationpatterns in Figure 3 are generated from the rolemappings listed using this semantic informationand interpretting the nominal role labels.
Forexample, the mapping (SUBJECT: DET-POSS,OBJECT: PP-OF) generates the nominalizationpattern:np(C-company) 's n(appointment)ofnp(C-person)(IBM's appointment of Alice Smith).5 Ad junct  Mapp ingsThe preceding section gave a simplified accountof mapping nominalization patterns.
We mustalso handle certain adjuncts.
Temporal PPs thatcan occur in clauses can usually occur in nom-inalizations as well.
The positions DET-POSSand N-N-MOD may be occupied by temporalNPs (Yesterday's appointment of Alice Smith byIBM, The January 3, 1998 appointment by IBMof Alice Smith).
When an NP is temporal andoccupies either of these positions it may fill atemporal slot in an IE pattern.
Since temporalNPs are neither companies, nor people, they willnot fill the object or subject slots in the IE pat-terns above.
Therefore, the possibility of fillingtemporal slots from DET-POSS and N-N-MODpositions hould cause no conflicts for appoint-ment.6 Re la ted  WorkOther computational linguistics work on decod-ing nominalizations includes (Hobbs and Grish-man, 1976), (DaM et al, 1987) and (Hull andGomez, 1996).
(Hull and Gomez, 1996) is themost similar to our own in that their ultimategoal is to extract information from the WorldBook Encyclopedia.
That task is defined differ-ently than for our MUC-related work.
The lex-ical entries created by Hull and Gomez includewould follow Afice Smith (the direct object).
These pat-terns would match The Alice Smith IBM appointment (orAlice Smith's IBM appointment) and give it a very sim-ilar interpretation to one in which IBM is the appointer.31selectional constraints ied to WordNet classes.Their procedure for converting nominalizationsinto predicate argument structure relies on thissemantic information, which they use to distin-guish nominalizations from nouns and argumentsfrom adjuncts.
Their coverage of arguments ilimited to subjects, objects, and prepositionalphrases, whereas NOMLEX provides detailedcoverage of all core and all oblique arguments.7 Conc lud ing  RemarksWe have been working on NOMLEX for one yearwith a staff of two part-time graduate students,one full-time staff member and one part-timestaff member.
We currently have 700 entriesand expect o have 1000 entries by Fall of 1998.After testing, we intend to distribute an alphaversion of NOMLEX via our FTP site.
This pa-per describes one of the applications for whichNOMLEX proves useful.
Our hope is that otherresearchers will apply NOMLEX to new applica-tions.
