Levenshtein Distances Fail to IdentifyLanguage Relationships AccuratelySimon J. Greenhill?The University of AucklandThe Levenshtein distance is a simple distance metric derived from the number of edit operationsneeded to transform one string into another.
This metric has received recent attention as ameans of automatically classifying languages into genealogical subgroups.
In this article I testthe performance of the Levenshtein distance for classifying languages by subsampling threelanguage subsets from a large database of Austronesian languages.
Comparing the classifica-tion proposed by the Levenshtein distance to that of the comparative method shows that theLevenshtein classification is correct only 40% of the time.
Standardizing the orthographyincreases the performance, but only to a maximum of 65% accuracy within language subgroups.The accuracy of the Levenshtein classification decreases rapidly with phylogenetic distance,failing to discriminate homology and chance similarity across distantly related languages.
Thispoor performance suggests the need for more linguistically nuanced methods for automatedlanguage classification tasks.1.
IntroductionThere are around 7,000 languages spoken in the world today (Lewis 2009) that tracethousands of years of human cultural and linguistic evolution.
Historical linguisticsdiscovers the relationships between these languages using the comparative methodto identify systematic sound correspondences between words in different languages.These correspondences distinguish the words that have descended from a commonancestor of the languages (i.e., are ?cognate?
), and are representative of the phonologicalor morphological innovations in the shared history of those languages (Durie andRoss 1996).
Take, for example, the following words meaning ?three?
: Javanese telu,Mussau tolu, and Tongan tolu.
One could therefore postulate that the two Oceaniclanguages, Mussau and Tongan, are more closely related to each other than to Javanese(in schematic form: Mussau,Tongan|Javanese) following a merger of Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *e/-aw into Proto-Oceanic *o (Blust 2009).Correctly identifying the relationships between these languages is not an exercisein mere phylogenetic classification but a tool for investigating human prehistory.
As anexample, linguists have used the comparative method to trace the spread of the 1,200 orso Austronesian languages across the Pacific back to Taiwan (Blust 1999; Pawley 2002).Recently, computational phylogenetic methods from evolutionary biology have been?

2011 Association for Computational LinguisticsComputational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4applied to this lexical cognate data.
For example, we tested different scenarios of Pacificsettlement and found compelling support for an origin of the Austronesian languagefamily in Taiwan around 5,200 years before present (Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill2009).
This combination of computational phylogenetic methods and linguistic datapromises to be a powerful way of exploring human prehistory and linguistic andcultural evolution (Greenhill, Blust, and Gray 2008; Currie et al 2010; Gray, Bryant, andGreenhill 2010).Using the comparative method to identify phylogeny requires a lot of lexical data,detailed knowledge about phonology (in general, and in the languages in question),and a lot of time (Durie and Ross 1996), however.
It has recently been suggested that theLevenshtein distance can be used to subgroup languages without the intensive timerequirement of the comparative method (Brown et al 2007) or the potential subjec-tivity involved in identifying sound correspondences (Serva and Petroni 2008).
TheLevenshtein distance (Levenshtein 1966) is a string comparison metric that counts thenumber of edit operations (replacements, insertions, and deletions) required to trans-form one string into another (Kruskal 1983).
For example, the Levenshtein distancebetween the Mussau and Tongan cognate words tolu is 0, and the difference between toluand Javanese telu is 1 (a replacement of the /e/ with /o/).
This is usually normalized bydividing by the length of the longest word (Brown et al 2007; Serva and Petroni 2008),so the distance between tolu/telu is 0.25.This Levenshtein classification has recently been applied to the Indo-European(Serva and Petroni 2008; Tria et al 2010), Austronesian (Petroni and Serva 2008), Turkic(van der Ark et al 2007), Indo-Iranian (van der Ark et al 2007), Mayan, Mixe-Zoque,Otomanguean, Huitotoan-Ocaina, Tacanan, Chocoan, Muskogean, and Austro-Asiaticlanguage families (Brown et al 2007; Holman et al 2008; Bakker et al 2009).
Theresults of Levenshtein classification have even been used to explore broader questionssuch as the relationship between population size and the rates of language evolution(Wichmann and Holman 2009), the dates of human population expansions (Serva andPetroni 2008; Wichmann and Holman 2009; Wichmann et al 2010), whether languagesarise and go extinct at a constant rate (Holman 2010), and to triangulate the homelandsof language families (Wichmann, Mu?ller, and Velupillai 2010).Proponents of Levenshtein classification have claimed that the results are very simi-lar to that of the comparative method.
However, to date there has been no rigorousattempt to quantify the performance of the Levenshtein distance at classifying lan-guages.
For example, Petroni and Serva (2008) use the Levenshtein distance to classify50 Austronesian languages, and claim that their obtained language phylogeny is ?sim-ilar?
to the results of the comparative method.
However, close inspection of their clas-sification reveals some puzzling incongruities.
Their tree correctly places the Atayalicsubgroup of the Formosan languages at the base of the tree (Blust 1999), but the nextsubgrouping on the tree is the large Oceanic subgroup before the rest of the Formosanlanguages are encountered.
According to the comparative method, the Austronesianlanguage family has a highly rake-like structure, and the Oceanic subgroup shouldbe nested within Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian and Eastern Malayo-Polynesian(Blust 1993, 2009; Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill 2009).
Instead, the Levenshteinclassification looks more like the results from a lexicostatistical analysis (Swadesh 1952;Embleton 1985), which incorrectly inferred the base of the Austronesian phylogeny to bein Near Oceania (Dyen 1965).
This alternative tree topology has been largely discountedas a methodological error due to an inability of the lexicostatistical methodology tohandle differences in the rates of lexical change (Bergsland and Vogt 1962; Blust 2000;Greenhill and Gray 2009).690Greenhill Accuracy of Levenshtein ClassificationThe incongruities between the Levenshtein classification and the comparativemethod demonstrates the need for a quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of theLevenshtein distance for genealogically subgrouping languages.
The large Austrone-sian language family is a good test case for evaluating the accuracy of comparativemethods (Greenhill and Gray 2009; Greenhill, Drummond, and Gray 2010).
First, themajor subgroups of the Austronesian language family are well established (Dempwolff1934, 1937, 1938; Grace 1959; Pawley 1972; Dahl 1973; Blust 1978, 1991, 1993, 1999, 2009;Ross 1988; Ross and N?ss 2007).
Second, most subgroups in the Austronesian familycan be identified from the basic vocabulary commonly used for Levenshtein classifica-tion (Greenhill, Drummond, and Gray 2010).
Third, there is a large-scale database ofAustronesian vocabulary available for such a test: the Austronesian Basic VocabularyDatabase (Greenhill, Blust, and Gray 2008).
In this article, I attempt to evaluate the ac-curacy of the Levenshtein classification method for identifying genealogical subgroups.2.
MethodThe Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database (ABVD) (Greenhill, Blust, and Gray 2008)is a large collection of basic vocabulary word lists from over 650 Austronesian lan-guages.
Each word list comprises 210 items such as words for body parts, kinshipterms, colors, numbers, verbs, nouns, and so forth.
These items are thought to be highlystable over time and resistant to being borrowed between languages (Swadesh 1952).From this database I extracted the word lists for 473 languages that belonged to theAustronesian language family and were not reconstructed proto-languages.To compare the performance of the Levenshtein classification to the traditionalsubgroupings I subsampled triplets of languages from these data 10,000 times.
Thecorrect classification of triplets is the simplest possible subgrouping task, with only fourpossible subgroupings: language A is more similar to language B than C (A,B|C), Ais closer to C (A,C|B), B is closer to C (B,C|A), and no language is closer to the other(A,B,C).
Restricting the comparison to triplets has the advantage of not requiring atree construction algorithm to infer the topology, and hence avoids adding uncertaintycaused by the phylogenetic reconstruction process (Susko, Inagaki, and Roger 2004).For each language triplet I obtained the expected linguistic subgrouping from theEthnologue database (Lewis 2009).
The Ethnologue is the primary catalogue of languageinformation about the world?s languages.
Each language has a classification string as-sociated with it that categorizes the language into a nested set of subgroups that are de-rived from primary historical linguistic research.
It could be argued that the Ethnologueclassification lags behind linguistic research (Campbell and Grondona 2008).
However,the deeper structure of the Austronesian language family has been well established for along time (Dempwolff 1934, 1937, 1938; Grace 1959; Pawley 1972; Dahl 1973; Blust 1978,1991, 1993, 1999, 2009; Ross 1988), and the recent release of the Ethnologue has updatedthe classification to match even quite newly identified language subgroups like Temotu(Ross and N?ss 2007).The normalized Levenshtein distance between each language pair in the three-language sample was calculated as follows.
In each of the 210 words in the ABVD wordlists, one entry was selected for each language.
Where the ABVD had multiple entriesfor a word in a language one of the entries was sampled at random.
The Levenshteindistance was then calculated for each pair of words (word 1 in language A vs. word 1in language B; word 2 in language A vs. word 2 in language B; etc.
), and normalized bydividing by the length of the longer word (Brown et al 2007; Holman et al 2008; Servaand Petroni 2008).
When one of the language pairs had no entries for a given word the691Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4word pair was ignored.
The average normalized Levenshtein distance for all 210 wordsbetween each pair of languages in the three-language sample was taken as a measureof relatedness between the language pairs.
These averaged distances were then used toselect the most appropriate of the four possible subgroupings (e.g., A,B|C, or A,C|B orB,C|A or A,B,C).
The subgrouping estimated from the Levenshtein distances was thenevaluated as correct when it matched the subgrouping obtained from the Ethnologue.A potential problem with this large-scale comparison is that the language data inthe ABVD have varying orthographies.
These differences in orthographies might playa crucial role in the accuracy of the Levenshtein distance to correctly infer languagerelationships.
The ABVD contains word lists from many different sources of data,but there are some subsets that contain consistent orthography.
To assess the effect oforthography on the Levenshtein distance comparison, I repeated the given procedurewhile sampling from three different subsets of languages.
The first of these subsets iscomposed of word lists for 121 languages across the Austronesian region obtained fromthe linguist Robert Blust (Blust 2000, 2009), and these are transcribed in Blust?s standardorthography.
In contrast, the second two subsets are composed of detailed languagesurveys of 91 languages from the Solomon Islands described in Tryon and Hackman(1983), and 45 Philippines languages described in Reid (1971).3.
ResultsThe average Levenshtein distance between each sampled pair of languages in thefull 473-language sample was 0.847 (s.d., 0.063).
In the Blust language subsample theaverage Levenshtein distance was 0.846 (s.d., 0.047).
The average distance for the Tryonand Hackman (1983) and Reid (1971) languages was 0.772 (s.d., 0.120) and 0.771 (s.d.,0.121), respectively.
Cronbach?s alpha (Nerbonne and Heeringa 2009) calculated on allinter-item distances between 1,000 random language pairs showed an alpha of 0.99,suggesting that the signal measured by the Levenshtein distance was consistent.The ability of the Levenshtein distance to identify the correct subgrouping fromthe three possible combinations was low.
In the full 473-language subsample theLevenshtein distance correctly identified 41.3% of the subgroupings.
In the Blust lan-guage subsample the accuracy was 36.9%.
In the Tryon and Hackman (1983) and Reid(1971) languages, the accuracy was higher at 65.8% and 64.3%, respectively.It may be unfair to penalize the Levenshtein classification for resolving a subgroupthat Ethnologue did not.
Discarding the comparisons when the expected classificationwas unresolved (A,B,C) increased the accuracy marginally: 47.8% Full data set, 44.7%Blust, 77.0% Tryon and Hackman (1983), and 76.8% Reid (1971).4.
DiscussionThe performance of the Levenshtein distance at classifying the Austronesian languagesusing basic vocabulary data was poor, with the correct subgroup chosen only 41.3% ofthe time.
The more standardized orthography in the Solomon Islands and Philippineslanguage subsets increased the accuracy of the classification to around 65%.
This wasnot the case for the Blust subsample, however, which scored the lowest accuracy of36.90%.
The relatively poor performance on the Blust subsample when compared to theSolomons and Philippines samples suggests that further standardization might not in-crease accuracy.
The Blust languages are sampled right across the range of Austronesianlanguages.
In contrast, the other subsets are sampled from distinct regions and containlanguages within a restricted set of subfamilies (e.g., Temotu, Meso-Melanesian, and692Greenhill Accuracy of Levenshtein ClassificationSouth-East Solomonic for the Solomon Islands subset; and Greater-Central Philippinesand North Luzon for the Philippines subset).The major limiting factor for classification accuracy using the Levenshtein distanceappears to be phylogenetic distance: how closely the languages are related.
Figure 1plots the average number of Ethnologue classification nodes in each three-languagesubset (Treelength) against the proportion of correct Levenshtein classifications for thetwo language subsets spanning the largest range of subgroups (the Full data set, andthe Blust subsample).
This figure shows that as the phylogenetic distance betweenlanguages increases, the Levenshtein distance is less accurate at choosing the correctclassification.
This finding is concordant with studies that have applied the Levenshteindistance to dialect-level data and have generally shown strong congruence betweenthe subgroupings estimated by traditional dialectology methods and the Levenshteindistance (Kessler 1995; Gooskens and Heeringa 2004; Heeringa et al 2006; Nerbonneand Heeringa 2009).
Interestingly, Figure 1 hints at an increase in accuracy with verylarge phylogenetic distances, perhaps suggesting a potential role for the Levenshteindistance for discriminating between different language families (van der Ark et al 2007).Figure 1Scatter plot showing the accuracy of the Levenshtein classification approach as a function ofphylogenetic distance.
Phylogenetic distance is measured by the average number of Ethnologueclassification nodes subtended by each language triplet.
The points are drawn from the twolanguage subsets spanning the largest range of subgroups (the full data set and the Blustsubsample) with LOESS curves of best fit (Full data set: triangles, dotted line; Blust data set:circles, line).693Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 4Why is the accuracy of the Levenshtein method so low?
The major cause of thispoor performance is that the Levenshtein distance is linguistically naive in at least fourways.
First, the Levenshtein distance blurs the distinction between cognate and non-cognate words.
Dialect studies generally explore the change within a cognate set wherethe Levenshtein distance between entries is generally one or two character changes.In contrast, when classifying languages, the metric conflates two different processes:change within a cognate set and change between cognate sets.
The distance betweentwo cognate words (e.g., tolu and telu) is small (0.25), however, calculating the distancebetween two different cognate sets tolu and (for example) Marovo hike gives a maxi-mally different string comparison.
When words are very different, then the Levenshteindistance is more likely to reflect chance similarity.Second, the Levenshtein distance identifies the surface similarity between words.Historical linguistics is skeptical about surface similarity for geneaological classification(Ringe 1992; Durie and Ross 1996), however, as surface similarity could reflect borrow-ing, sound symbolism, onomatopoeia, nursery forms, or chance instead of phylogeneticrelationships (Campbell and Poser 2008).Third, processes like metathesis, reduplication, and fossilization of affixes can in-volve multiple character differences but only occur as one change.
For example, Malaytakut ?to fear?
is cognate with Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *ma-takut ?fearful, afraid?
(Blust2009).
The *ma- is a stative prefix that has a tendency to become fossilized (Blust2009).
Rather than a single change, the Levenshtein distance would represent this astwo or three insertions/deletions.
The third issue is that, under the Levenshtein, allphonological changes are equally likely and occur at the same rates.
In reality, somechanges occur very rarely whereas others occur frequently and repeatedly (e.g.
/t/ to/k/ is thought to have occurred independently at least 20 times within Austronesian[Blust 2004]).
In a good model, these frequent changes should have lower penalties thanother changes that are more unlikely.A final cause of this poor classification performance is a result of subgroupinglanguages according to an overall distance metric.
Intuitively, clustering according tominimal distance makes sense, although this has two consequences.
First, distancemetrics ignore the distinction between forms that are common retentions from anancestral language, and the forms that are shared innovations in a set of languages.This distinction?a ?fundamental tenant of the comparative method?
(Blust 2000,page 314)?is critical for correct subgrouping (Brugmann 1884; Hennig 1966; Blust 2000;Greenhill and Gray 2009).
Second, distance metrics remove a large proportion of thesignal in the data and better classification performance is achieved when raw data areused (Steel, Hendy, and Penny 1988).
By using a distance-based subgrouping methodthe Levenshtein is susceptible to exactly the same problems that classical lexicostatisticsfaced (Swadesh 1952).
In particular, there is a very high vulnerability to variation inretention rates (Bergsland and Vogt 1962; Blust 2000; Greenhill and Gray 2009).
Dyen(1965) applied lexicostatistics to the Austronesian language family and interpreted theresults as indicating an origin in Melanesia, possibly in the Bismarck Archipelago northof New Guinea.
This contradicts sharply with the view from historical linguistics whichsuggests Taiwan as the homeland (Blust 1999; Gray, Drummond, and Greenhill 2009).Blust (2000) has demonstrated that retention rates in Malayo-Polynesian languagesrange from 5% to 60% over the last 4,000 years or so.
The languages which have hadmore replacement in basic vocabulary are predominantly those of Melanesia, wherethere has been much contact-induced change as incoming Austronesian languagesencountered non-Austronesian languages (Ross 1996).
Subgrouping the languages withlower similarities placed these Melanesian languages at the base of the tree, and led to694Greenhill Accuracy of Levenshtein Classificationthe incorrect inference of a Melanesian homeland (Blust 2000; Greenhill and Gray 2009).A Levenshtein-derived classification of the Austronesian languages (Petroni and Serva2008) makes an identical mistake, suggesting that this approach is just as adverselyaffected by variations in retention rate.
It is therefore crucial to use methods that canuse all the cognate data, and account for variation in rates of lexical change over time?like Bayesian phylogenetic methods (Greenhill and Gray 2009).Using the Levenshtein distance to automatically classify languages has many attrac-tions.
These results indicate that better methods and approaches need to be explored,however.
One approach would be to make a less linguistically naive distance.
Forexample, the algorithm could be altered to allow larger changes such as metathesisand reduplication.
Or the transposition weights could be modified to make transitionsbetween common sound changes less penalized.
These weights could be adjusted usingevidence from historical linguistics (Blevins 2004), or using a more general acousticdistance measure (Mielke 2005).
One step towards a more nuanced distance has beentaken by Wieling, Prokic?, and Nerbonne (2009), who modified the Levenshtein distanceto handle increased rates of metathesis in Bulgarian dialects and found a small increasein performance on a string alignment task.
A further modification using a PointwiseMutual Information method to learn the weights of phonetic transitions performedbetter and had fewer errors than the modified Levenshtein.Regardless of potential improvements, using a static metric like the Levenshteinis still problematic.
Processes like metathesis and reduplication are not necessarilycommon in other languages or language families, and common sound changes are notonly phonetically constrained but are also constrained by the sounds already occurringin a language.
A superior approach would be to use an adaptive algorithm to learnthe transition weights from the data before classifying the languages using methodslike naive Bayesian classifiers (Dunning 1994; Ellison 2007), dynamic Bayesian networks(Kondrak and Sherif 2006), or stochastic transducers (Ristad and Yianilos 1998).
A recenttechnique uses a probabilistic model of phonological change trained on a corpus of datawith an expectation-maximization algorithm to infer protoforms directly based on aphylogeny (Bouchard-Co?te?
et al 2008; Bouchard-Co?te?, Griffiths, and Klein 2009).
Giventhese new methods which promise substantial increases in performance, and the largecollection of established cognate data contained in databases like the ABVD that canbe used to train these algorithms, there is no reason to continue using the Levenshteindistance to classify languages.AcknowledgmentsI thank Quentin Atkinson, Russell Gray,Robert Ross, Annik van Toledo, and fouranonymous reviewers for discussion andsuggestions.
