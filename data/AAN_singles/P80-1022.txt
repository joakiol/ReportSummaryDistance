THE COMPUTER AS AN ACTIVECOMMUNICATION MEDIUMJohn C. ThomasIBM T. J. Watson Research CenterPO Box 218 Yorktown Heights, New York 10598I.
THE NATURE OF COMMUNICATION goals r4imetacomments that direct the conversat ion\[~Communication is often conceived of in basically thefollowing terms.
A person has some idea which he orshe wants to communicate to a second person.
Thefirst person translates that idea into some symbolsystem which is transmitted through some medium tothe receiver.
The receiver receives the transmissionand translates it into some internal idea.
Communica-tion, in this view, is considered good to the extent thatthere is an isomorphism between the idea in the headof the sender before sending the message and theidea in the receiver's head after recieving the mes-sage.
A good medium of communication, in this view,is one that adds minimal noise to the signal.
Mes-sages are considered good partly to the extent thatthey are unabmiguous.
This is, by and large, the viewof many of the people concerned with computers andcommunication.For a moment, consider a quite different view of com-munication.
In this view, communication is basically adesign-interpretation process.
One person has goalsthat they believe can be aided by communicating.
Theperson therefore designs a message which is intendedto facill itate those goals.
In most cases, the goal in-cludes changing some cognitive structure in one ormore other people's minds.
Each receiver of a mes-sage however has his or her own goals in mind and amodel of the world (including a model of the sender)and interprets the received message in light of thatother world information and relative to the perceivedgoals of the sender.
This view has been articulatedfurther elsewhere !~\].This view originates primarily from putting the rules oflanguage and the basic nature of human beings inperspective.
The basic nature of human beings is thatwe are living organisms and our behavior is goals-directed.
The rules of language are convenient butsecondary.
We can language rules for a purposebreak.Communicating in different media produces differentbehaviors and reactions I-2,3!
The interesting firstorder finding however, is that people ca.
communicateusing practically any medium that lets any signalthrough if motivation is high enough.
We can, undersome circumstances, communicate with people whouse different accents, grammars, or even languages.Yet, in other circumstances, people who are ostensiblyfriends working on a common goal and who haveknown each other for years end up shouting at eachother: 'You're not listening to me.
No, you don't un-derstand!
'One fundamental aspect of human communication thenis that it is terrifically adaptive, and robust, containinga number of sophisticated mechanisms such as expla-nations that simultaneously facillitate social and workand rules for taking turns 6~To the extent that these mechanisms can be embed-ded in a computer system that is to dialogue with hu-mans, the dialogue will likely tend to be more suc-cessful.
However, equally true of human communica-tion is that it is sometimes quite ineffective.
Let usexamine where, why, and how the computer can helpimprove communication in those cases.2.
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFICULTIES INCOMMUNICA TIONThe view of communication as a design-interpretationprocess suggests that since messages are designedand interpretted to achieve goals, the perceived rela-tionship between the goals of the communicators islikely to be a powerful determinant of what happens incommunication.
Common observation as well experi-mental resutts\[ l !are consistent with this notion.
Peo-ple often view themselves in situations of pure compe-.tition or pure cooperation.
In fact, I suggest that ei-ther perception is due to a limited frame.
Any twopeople who view themselves as involved in a zero-sumgame are doing so because they have a limited frameof reference.
In the widest possible frame of refer-ence, there is at least one state probabilistically influ-enced by their acts (such as the total destruction ofhuman life through nuclear weapons) that both wouldfind undesirable.
Therefore, when I am playing tennis,poker, or politics with someone and we say we are inpure competition, we are only doing so in a limitedframework.
In a wider framework, it is always in ourmutual interest to cooperate under certain circum-stances.This does not mean, however, that people perceivethis wider framework.
Because of the limitations ofhuman working memory, people often forget that thereis a framework in which they can cooperate.
Indeed,this describes one of the chief situations in which aso-called breakdown of communications occurs.
If weare truly in a zero-sum game, communication is onlyuseful to the extent that we mislead, threaten, etc.Conversely, people are only in pure cooperation bylimiting their framework.
I suggest that it is highlylikely, given any two individuals, that they would put adifferent preference ordering on the set of all possiblestates of the world which their actions could probabil-istically affect.
This gives rise to a second type ofbreakdown in communication.
People appear to bedesiring to cooperate but they are only cooperatingwith respect to some limited framework X.
They arecompeting with respect to some larger framework Xplus Y.
The most common X plus Y is X, the frame-work of cooperation plus Y, a consideration of whosehabits must change for mutually beneficial action inthe framework X.83For instance, two tennis partners obviously both wantto win the game.
Yet one is used to playing with bothpartners attempting to take the net.
The other is usedto the 'one-up, one-back' strategy.
They can get intoa real argument.
What they are competing about isbasically who is going to change, whose opinion iswrong, and similar issues.
This then, in a sense, is asecond type of breakdown of communication.A third case exists even within the framework of coop-eration.
This case of difficult communication existswhen the presupposed conceptual frameworks of thecommunicators is vitally discrepant.
A computer pro-grammer really wants to help a business person auto-mate his or her invoicing application and the businessperson really wants this to happen.
However, eachparty erroneously presumes more shared knowledgeand viewpoint than in fact exists.A puzzle still remains however.
If people have suchsophisticated, graceful, robust communication mecha-nisms, why do they not quite readily and spontaneous-ly overcome these communication blocks?WIDESPREAD ANTI-PRODUCTIVE BELIEFSThe biggest stumbling blocks to effective communica-tion are the individual communicator's beliefs.
Peopletyp~c,,lly hold beliefs which are not empirically based.
Tosome extent, it is impossible not to.
In order to sim-plify the world sufficiently to deal with it, we makegeneralizations.
If it turns out on closer inspectionthat these genralizations are correct, we call it insightwhile if it turns out that they are incorrect, we call itovergeneralization.There are, however, a number of specific non-empirically based beliefs that people are particularlylikely to believe which are anti-productive to commu-nication.
Among these are the following: 1.
I must beunderstood; 2.
If the other person disagrees with me,they don't understand me; 3.
My worth is equal to myperformance; 4.
Things should be easy; 5.
The worldmust be fair; 6.
If I have the feeling of knowing some-thing is true, it must be true; 7.
If the other personthinks my idea is wrong, the person thinks little of me;8.
If this person's idea is wrong, the person is worth-less; 9.
I don't need to change --  they do; 10.
Since Ialready know I'm right, it is a waste of time to reallytry to see things from the other person's perspective.11.
If I comprehend something, in the sense that I canrephrase it in a syntactically different way, that meansI have processed deeply enough what the other personis saving.
12.
I must tell the truth at all times no mat-ter what.
13.
If they cannot put it in the form of anequation (or computer program, or complete sen-tences, or English), they don't really Know what theyare talking about and so it is not possibly in my inter-est to listen.Each of the above statements, has a correlated, lessrigid, less extreme statement that is empirically based.For instance, if we really thought 'When I am wrong,some people will temporari ly value me less', that isvalid generalization.
In contrast, the thought 'Whenam wrong, people will value me less' is an overgener-alization.Similarly, it is quite reasonable to believe that ex-pressing something mathematical ly has advantagesand that if it is not expressed mathematical ly it maybe more difficult for me to use the ideas; it may evenbe so difficult that I choose not to bother.
It is notempirically based to believe that it is never worth youwhile to attempt to understand things not expressed inequations.Nearly everyone, even quite psychotic people holdrational as well as irrational beliefs.
Very few peoplewhen asked whether they have to be perfect in every-thing will say yes.
However, very many people rejectso completely evidence that they may be fundamental.ly wrong, that they act as though they must be per-fect.
It is bitter irony that most people can think andfeel much more clearly about the things that are lessimportant to them such as a crossword puzzle thanthey can about things that are much more importantsuch as their major decisions in work and love.Now let us imagine someone who has done a certainoffice procedure a certain way for many years.
Thensomeone begins to explain a new procedure that isclaimed to work better.
There are a number of whollyrational reasons why the experienced office workercan be skeptical.
But it is probably quite worthwhileto at least attempt to really understand the otherperson's ideas before criticizing them.
There aremany non-empirical ly based beliefs that may interferin the communication process.
The experienced officeworker may, for instance, notice the young age of thesystems analyst and believe that no-one so youngcould really understand what is going on.
They maybelieve that if there is a better way, they should haveseen it themselves years ago and if they didn't theymust be an idiot.
Since they didn't see it and theycan't be an idiot, there must not be a better way.They may just think to themselves it will be too hardto learn a new way.
Very effective individual therapy~\ ] i s  based on trying to identify and change anindividual's irrational beliefs.
The focus of this paperhowever is on how a computer system could aid com-munication by overcoming or circumventing such irra-t ional beliefs in those cases where communicationappears to break down.We know that people are capable of changing from anarrow competit ion framework to a wider cooperativeframework in order to communicate.
People can re-solve differences about whose behavior needs tochange.
Normal communication has the mechanisms todo these things; when they fail to happen it is oftenbecause of irrational beliefs which prevent peoplefrom attempting to see things from the other person'sperspective.The t~nnis partner's disagreeing about what strategyto use will tend to resolve the disagreement withoutdetriment to their mutual goal of winning the game,provided their thinking stays fairly close to the empiri-cal level.
If, however, one of the participants finds a84flaw in the other's thinking and then overgeneral izesand thinks 'What an idiot.
That doesn't  logically fol-low.
How can anyone be so dumb.'
But by the token'dumb', the angry person probably means 'al l -aroundbad.'
Now this is an extrememly counter-product iveovergeneral izat ion which will tend to color theperson's thinking on other issues of the game whichare not even within the scope of the argument aboutwhat strategy to use, In extremely irrational but notso uncommon cases, the person may even express tothe other person verbal ly or non-verbal ly  that theyhave a generally low opinion of their partner.
If eitherparty becomes angry, they are also likely to mix uptheir messages about their own internal state withmessages about the content of the game.
Thus, '1 amangry,' gets mixed with 'A serve to that person'sbackhand will probably produce a weaker return.'
Theresult may be a statement like 'Why can't you serve tohis backhand for a change.'
Such a statement is likelyto increase the probabil ity of serves to the forehandor double faults to the backhand.Once each person becomes angry with the other, theyare almost certainly overgeneral iz ing to the extent thatthey are believing that the onty way to improve thesituation is for the other person to change their be-havior in some way 'He should apologize to me forbeing such an idiot.'
No active problem solving behav-ior remains directed where it belongs: 'How can I im-prove the situation myself?
How can I communicatebetter?'
This is communication breakdown.4.
THE POSSIBLE USES OF AN ACTIVE COMMU-NICATION CHANNELNow, let's just for the sake of arguement, =,surae or ifyou like pretend that what I have said so far is a usefulperspective.
What about the computer?
In particular,what about using the power of the computer as a non-t ransparent  ACTIVE medium of communication?
Thecomputer has been very successfully used as a wayfor people to communicate  which al lowsspeed/repet i t ion and demands precision.
Is there alsoa way for the computer to be used to enhance party-to -party  communication in a way that helps defeat orget around the self-defeating beliefs that get in theway of effective communicat ion in situations whereparticipants have similar goals but are working in dif-ferent frameworks?
Can the computer aid in situationswhere participants have partial ly similar goals but areconcentrat ing on the differences.. .or are unable toarrive at conclusions that are in both parties self-interest because of interferrence from a set of sepa-rate issues where they are in fundamental conflict?An entire technology equal to the one that has ad-dressed the speed/repet ion precision issues could bebuilt around this task.
Clearly I cannot provide thistechnology myself in f ifteen minutes or fifteen years.But let me provide one example of the k~nd of thing Imean.
Suppose that one two people were disagreeingand communicating via Visual Display Terminals con-nected to a computer network.
Let us suppose thatthe computer network imposed a formalism on thecommunication.
Suppose, for example that strengthand directional ity of current emotional state were en-coded on a spatially separate channel from contentmessages.
Imagine that the designer of the messagehad to choose what emotion or emotions they felt andattempt to honestly quantify these.
This informationwould be presented to the other person separatelyfrom the content statements.
One unfortunate humanweakness would be overcome; viz., the tendency to letthe emotional statement --  '1 am angry' intrude intothe content of what is said.Now, suppose the computer network presented to theinterpretter of this message a set of signals labelledas follows: 'The person sending this message to you iscurrently producing the fol lowing emotional states inthemselves: Anger +7,  Anxiety +4,  Hurt +3,  Depres-sion +2,  Gladness -6. '
Note that the attr ibution hasalso been shifted squarely to where it belongs --  onthe person with the emotional state.Now suppose further that when a person stated theirposition, certain key words tr iggered a request by thesystem for restatement.
For instance, suppose a per-son typed in 'You always get what you want.'
The sys-tem may respond with: 'Regarding the word 'always',could you be more quantitative.
First, in how manyinstances during the last two weeks would you esti-mate that there have been occassions when that per-son would like to have gotten something but could notget that thing?
'Unfortunately, asked just such a question, an angryperson would probably become angrier and directsome anger toward the active channel itself.
A mar-riage counselor is often caught in just this sort ofbind, but can usually avoid escalating anger via empa-thy and other natural mechanisms.
How a computer-ized system could avoid increasing anger remains achallenge.Another possibil ity would be for the channel to enforcethe protocol for conflict resolution suggested by Rap-paport and others.
For instance, before stating yourposition, you would have to restate your opponent'sposition to their satisfaction.Needless to say, participants using such an activeinterface would be apprized of the fact and voluntari lychoose to use such an interface for their anticipatedmutual benefit in the same way that labor and man-agement often agree to use a mediator or arbitrator toheld them reach an equitable solution.
Unfortunately,such a choice requires that both the people involvedrecognize that they are not perfect - -  that their com-munication ability could use an active channel.
This initself presupposes some dismissal of the erroneousbelief that their worth EQUALS their performance.Most people are capable of doing this before theybecome emotional ly upset and hence might well agreeahead of time to using such a channel.5.
SUMMARYIn this paper, I reiterate the view that for many pur-poses, communicat ion is best conceived of as a85design-interpretation process rather than a sender-receiver process.
Fundamental difficulties in two-person communication occur in certain common situa-tions.
The incidence, exacerbation, and failure tosolve such communication problems by the partiesthemselves can largely be traced to the high frequencyof strongly held anti-empirical belief systems.
Finally,it is suggested that the computer is a medium for hu-mans to communicate with each other VIA.
Viewed inthis way, possibilities exist for the computer to be-come an acti~ and aelecti~ rather than a p~.s~, tn=nJparentmedium.
This could aid humans in overcoming orcircumventing communication blocking irrational be-liefs in order to facillitate cooperative problem solving.6.
