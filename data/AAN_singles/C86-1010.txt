28/29D-IO00 Ber l in  10Germany - West BerlinThis paper  bu i lds  upon and extends  cer ta in  ideasdeve loped  w i th in  the  framework of  Genera l i zed  PhraseS t ruc ture  Grammar (GPSG).
i l l  A new descr ip t ivedev ice ,  the  Category  Cooccurrence Rest r i c t ion  (CCR),i s  in t roduced  in ana logy  to  ex is t ing  dev ices  of  GPSGin order to express constraints on the cooccurrenceof categories within local trees (i.e.
trees of depthone) which at present are stated with ImmediateDominance (ID) rules and metarules.
In addition toproviding a uniform format for the statement of suchconstraints, CCRs permit generalizations to beexpressed which presently cannot be captured in GPSG.Sections l.l and 1.2 introduce CCRs and presupposeonly a general familiarity with GPSG.
The ideas donot depend on details of GPSG and can be applied toother grammatical formalisms.Sections 1.3 - 1.5 discuss CCRs in relation toparticular principles of GPSG and ass~ne familiaritywith Gazdar et al (\].985) (henceforth abbreviated'GKPS').
Finally, sect ion  2 conta ins  proposa ls  forusing CCRs to avoid the ana lyses  with metarules givenfor English in GKPS.1.

A context  f reeru le  b inds  in fo rmat ion  of  two sor ts  in a s ing lestatement, namely(a) in fo rmat ion  about which daughters  a rook hasin  a loca l  t ree  and(b) in fo rmat ion  about the  order in  which thedaughters  appear .By separat ing  th i s  in fo rmat ion  in ID and LP ru les ,GPSG is able to state generalizations of the sort "Apreceeds B in every local tree which contains both asdaughters," which cannot be captured in a contextf ree  grammar (CFG).Now cons ider  an ID ru le  such as the  fo l low ing :(i) S --> A, B, CThe fundmnental motivation for CCRs rests on theinsight that such an ID rule itself combines twodifferent kinds of information in a single statement,namely(a) information involving immediate dominancerelations, here that <S, A>~ <S, B>, and<S, C> are ordered pairs of categories inwhich the first category inmlediately dominatesthe second and(b) information about the cooccurrence ofcategories in a single local tree.By distinguishing and separately representing thesetypes of information it becomes possible to stategeneralizations of the following sort, which cannotbe captured in the ID/LP format:(2) Any loca l  t ree  w i th  S as i t s  root  must have A asa daughter .
(3) No loca l  t ree  wi th  C as a daughter  a l so  has D asa daughter .S ta tements  such as (2) and (3) res t r i c t ing  thecooccur rence  of ca tegor ies  in loca l  t rees  areCategory  Cooccurrence Rest r i c t ions ,  which areexpress ions  of f i r s t  a rder  p red icate  log ic  us ing  twopr imi t ive  pred icates ,  R(cx, t )  'cx i s  the  root  of loca lt ree  t '  and D(~, t )  'a  i s  a daughter  in  loca l  t reet ' .

Fortunately, the idea of CCRs can beutilized in a general principle that replaces all.lexJca\] ID rules (i.e.
those which have a head thatis an extension of a SUBCAT category; cf GKPS, p.54), so that only nonleA'ical ID rules need beexplicitly reformulated with individual CCRs.Shieber (1983) and Pollard (1985) have proposedthat a list- or stack-valued feature (SYNCAT orSUBCAT) be introduced whose value contains thecomplements of a head category.
This paper uses TYPas a syntactic feature with a semantically orientedand lexJcally determined semantic type as its value.Following the convention of GKPS (p. 189), '<~, B>'will be written for <TYP(~), TYP(~)> where ~ andare categories.
Given the structure of complex typesin GKPS as single-valued functions, the types may beviewed as lists or stacks.A Complement-Type Principle (CTP) can now bestated which has the form of a schematic CCR withconditions on variables:( \ ]7) (a)\]IX\[BAR 0, +H, TYP<6 I, <...<Sn_ l, 5n>...>>\] \]1 X\[TYP 5n\](b) \[IX\[BAR 0, +H, TYP <61, <...<6n_l, 6n>...>> \]X\[TYP 51\] ^... ^X\[TYP 5n_l\]^ ~X\[TYP 6'\] \]Iwhere(i) 5' ~ {61 .... .

The use of CTP in dealing with metaruleswill be shown in section 2 below, but first anothergeneral aspect of the metarule problem must bediscussed.1.4 Metaru \ ]es  and Lex ica l  RulesGKPS in t roduces  not on ly  metaru les ,  e .g .

Given the ricll palette offormal.tams recently proposed for kinds of unificationgra~mlar~ it seems rather ingenuous to create a newname for thin modification of GPSG, as though tilemultitude of remaining open questions were therebyanswered.
What we need is a metaformalism that willrelate the insights of all the current formalismsthrough formal invariants preserved under translationfrom one formalism to another, and that will thentruly deserve a name of its own.\[8\] The assmnpt ion  here  i s  that  any work done by t i leFeature  Spec i f i ca t ion  Defau l t s  (FSDs) of  GKPS canbe accomplished with suitably defined FCRs andCC~s.
This will he illustrated in section 2 hutcannot be shown in general in this paper.2.
The E l iminat ion  of Metaru les2.1 Genera l  RemarksGKPS a l lows  metaru les  to  be used in ways thatin tu i t i ve ly  seem undes i rab le .
For example, a metaru lemay s imply  ind icate  that.

Thus, the ru les  of(19) cannot be abbrev ia ted  w i th  braces  as in (23):(23) s -> (A) ,  B, (C)DSince such abbrev ia tory  convent ions  for  express ingcoocur rence  res t r i c t ions  a re  not p rov ided  by GPSG, it.i s  not ~.mrpr is ing that  t im i r  work i s  assumed bymetaru les .

Although the head V dominatedby VP\[PAS\] is not mentioned in PM, it must bespecified <VFOEN~ PAS> in a local tree by virtue ofthe Head Feature Convention.As noted in section 1.4, however, PM does only asmall part of the work for passive, the main task"falling to the Lexical Rule for Passive Forms.Moreover, some of the predictions of PM areincorrect.

Further restrictions must determine whenV has which mother.
In addition to the FCRs of (29)and (30), retained from GKPS, the new FCR of (31) isintroduced:(30) \[+INV, BAR 2\] D \[+SUBJ\] (FCR I0)(31) \[INV\] ~ \[+V, -N\]INV is a HEAD feature subject to the Head FeatureConvention (cf GKPS, pp.
94-99), so a V 2 mother ofV\[+INVJ must be specified <INV, +> and therefore also<SUBJ, +>.
If V is specified <INV, -> (note that (31)requires it to have some specification for INV), thenits mother is *lot an extension of V 2 (providing forcoordination) or it is specified <SUBJ, -> accordingto the following CCR:(32) I\[ V\[-INV\] 31 (~V 2 v \[-SUBJ\]) \[12\]Although GKPS provides fo r  ,an embedded inver tedsentence in What d Jd  you  see?
