Language Technology for Closely Related Languages and Language Variants (LT4CloseLang), page 66,October 29, 2014, Doha, Qatar.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsTowards Universal Syntactic Processing of Natural Language(invited talk)Slav PetrovGoogle Inc.76 9th AvenueNew York, NY 10011slav@google.com1 AbstractIn this talk I will first describe some techniquesfor projecting syntactic information across lan-guage boundaries, allowing us to build models forlanguages with no labeled training data.
I willthen present some ongoing work towards a univer-sal representation of morphology and syntax thatmakes it possible to model language phenomenaacross language boundaries in a consistent way.Finally, I will highlight some examples of howwe have successfully used syntax at Google to im-prove downstream applications like question an-swering and machine translation.2 Author?s BiographySlav Petrov is a researcher in Google?s New Yorkoffice, leading a team that works on syntactic pars-ing and its applications to information extraction,question answering and machine translation.
Heholds a PhD degree from UC Berkeley, where heworked with Dan Klein.
Before that he completeda Master?s degree at the Free University of Berlinand was a member of the FU-Fighters team thatwon the RoboCup world championship in 2004.His work on fast and accurate multilingual syntac-tic analysis has been recognized with best paperawards at ACL 2011 and NAACL 2012.
