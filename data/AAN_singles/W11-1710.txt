Abaseline system for emotion analysis ofJapanese sentences has been developedbased on the Japanese WordNet Affect.
Theincorporation of morphology improves theperformance of the system.
Overall, thesystem achieves average precision, recalland F-scores of 32.76%, 53% and 40.49%respectively on 89 sentences of the Japa-nese judgment corpus and 83.52%, 49.58%and 62.22% on 1000 translated Japanesesentences of the SemEval 2007 affect sens-ing test corpus.
Different experimental out-comes and morphological analysis suggestthat irrespective of the google translationerror, the performance of the system couldbe improved by enhancing the JapaneseWordNet Affect in terms of coverage.1 IntroductionEmotion analysis, a recent sub discipline at thecrossroads of information retrieval (Sood et al,2009) and computational linguistics (Wiebe et al,2006) is becoming increasingly important fromapplication view points of affective computing.The majority of subjective analysis methods thatare related to emotion is based on textual keywordsspotting that use specific lexical resources.
Senti-WordNet (Baccianella et al, 2010) is a lexical re-source that assigns positive, negative and objectivescores to each WordNet synset (Miller, 1995).
Sub-jectivity wordlist (Banea et al, 2008) assignswords with the strong or weak subjectivity andprior polarities of types positive, negative and neu-tral.
Affective lexicon (Strapparava and Valitutti,2004), one of the most efficient resources of emo-tion analysis, contains emotion words.
To the bestof our knowledge, these lexical resources havebeen created for English.
A recent study shows thatnon-native English speakers support the growinguse of the Internet1.
Hence, there is a demand forautomatic text analysis tools and linguistic re-sources for languages other than English.In the present task, we have prepared the Japa-nese WordNet Affect from the already availableEnglish WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti,2004).
Entries in the English WordNet Affect areannotated using Ekman?s (1993) six emotionalcategories (joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, sur-prise).
The collection of the English WordNet Af-fect 2 synsets that are used in the present work wasprovided as a resource in the ?Affective Text?shared task of SemEval-2007 Workshop.The six WordNet Affect lists that were providedin the shared task contain only 612 synsets in totalwith 1536 words.
The words in each of the sixemotion lists have been observed to be not morethan 37.2% of the words present in the correspond-ing SentiWordNet synsets.
Hence, these six listsare expanded with the synsets retrieved from the1 http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm2 http://www.cse.unt.edu/~rada/affectivetext/80English SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al, 2010).We assumed that the new sentiment bearing wordsin English SentiWordNet might have some emo-tional connotation in Japanese even keeping theirpart-of-speech (POS) information unchanged.
Thenumbers of entries in the expanded word lists areincreased by 69.77% and 74.60% at synset andword levels respectively.
We have mapped thesynsetID of the WordNet Affect lists with the syn-setID of the WordNet 3.03.
This mapping helps inexpanding the WordNet Affect lists with the recentversion of SentiWordNet 3.0 4 as well as translatingwith the Japanese WordNet (Bond et al, 2009).Some affect synsets (e.g., 00115193-a huffy, mad,sore) are not translated into Japanese as there areno equivalent synset in the Japanese WordNet.Primarily, we have developed a baseline systembased on the Japanese WordNet Affect and carriedout the evaluation on a Japanese judgement corpusof 89 sentences.
The system achieves the averageF-score of 36.39% with respect to six emotionclasses.
We have also incorporated an open sourceJapanese morphological analyser 5 .
The perform-ance of the system has been increased by 4.1% inaverage F-score with respect to six emotion classes.Scarcity of emotion corpus in Japanese moti-vated us to apply an open source google translator6to build the Japanese emotion corpus from theavailable English SemEval-2007 affect sensingcorpus.
The baseline system based on the JapaneseWordNet Affect achieves average precision, recalland F-score of 83.52%, 49.58% and 62.22% re-spectively on 1000 translated test sentences.
Theinclusion of morphological processing improvesthe performance of the system.
Different experi-ments have been carried out by selecting differentranges of annotated emotion scores.
Error analysissuggests that though the system performs satisfac-torily in identifying the sentential emotions basedon the available words of the Japanese WordNetAffect, the system suffers from the translated ver-sion of the corpus.
In addition to that, the JapaneseWordNet Affect also needs an improvement interms of coverage.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Different developmental phases of the JapaneseWordNet Affect are described in Section 3.
Prepa-3 http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/download/4 http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/5 http://mecab.sourceforge.net/6 http://translate.google.com/#ration of the translated Japanese corpus, differentexperiments and evaluations based on morphologyand the annotated emotion scores are elaborated inSection 4.
Finally Section 5 concludes the paper.2 Related WorksThe extraction and annotation of subjective termsstarted with machine learning approaches (Hat-zivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997).
Some wellknown sentiment lexicons have been developed,such as subjective adjective list (Baroni and Veg-naduzzo, 2004), English SentiWordNet (Esuli et.al., 2006), Taboada?s adjective list (Voll andTaboada, 2007), SubjectivityWord List (Banea etal., 2008) etc.
Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006)present a method for extracting positive or negativesentiment bearing adjectives from WordNet usingthe Sentiment Tag Extraction Program (STEP).The proposed methods in (Wiebe and Riloff, 2006)automatically generate resources for subjectivityanalysis for a new target language from the avail-able resources for English.
On the other hand, anautomatically generated and scored sentiment lexi-con, SentiFul (Neviarouskaya et al, 2009), itsexpansion, morphological modifications and dis-tinguishing sentiment features also shows the con-tributory results.But, all of the above mentioned resources are inEnglish and have been used in coarse grained sen-timent analysis (e.g., positive, negative or neutral).The proposed method in (Takamura et al, 2005)extracts semantic orientations from a small numberof seed words with high accuracy in the experi-ments on English as well as Japanese lexicons.But, it was also aimed for sentiment bearing words.Instead of English WordNet Affect (Strapparavaand Valitutti, 2004), there are a few attempts inother languages such as, Russian and Romanian(Bobicev et al, 2010), Bengali (Das and Bandyop-adhyay, 2010) etc.
Our present approach is similarto some of these approaches but in contrast, wehave evaluated our Japanese WordNet Affect on theSemEval 2007 affect sensing corpus translated intoJapanese.
In recent trends, the application of me-chanical turk for generating emotion lexicon (Mo-hammad and Turney, 2010) shows promisingresults.
In the present task, we have incorporatedthe open source, available and accessible resourcesto achieve our goals.813 Developmental Phases3.1 WordNet AffectThe English WordNet Affect, based on Ekman?s sixemotion types is a small lexical resource comparedto the complete WordNet but its affective annota-tion helps in emotion analysis.
Some collection ofWordNet Affect synsets was provided as a resourcefor the shared task of Affective Text in SemEval-2007.
The whole data is provided in six filesnamed by the six emotions.
Each file contains a listof synsets and one synset per line.
An examplesynset entry from WordNet Affect is as follows.a#00117872 angered  enraged  furious  infuri-ated  maddenedThe first letter of each line indicates the part ofspeech (POS) and is followed by the affectID.
Therepresentation was simple and easy for furtherprocessing.
We have retrieved and linked the com-patible synsetID from the recent version of Word-Net 3.0 with the affectID of the WordNet Affectsynsets.
We have searched each WordNet Affectsynset in WordNet 3.0.
If a matching WordNet 3.0synset is found, the WordNet 3.0 synsetID ismapped to the WordNet Affect affectID.
The link-ing between two synsets of WordNet Affect andWordNet 3.0 is shown in Figure 1.WordNet Affect:n#05587878 anger choler irea#02336957 annoyed harassed harried pesteredvexedWordNet:07516354-n anger, ire, choler02455845-a annoyed harassed harried pesteredvexedLinked Synset ID with Affect ID:n#05587878 ??

02455845-a annoyed harassedharried pestered vexedFigure 1: Linking between the synsets of Word-Net Affect and WordNet3.2 Expansion of WordNet Affect using Sen-tiWordNetIt has been observed that the WordNet Affect con-tains fewer number of emotion word entries.
Thesix lists provided in the SemEval 2007 shared taskcontain only 612 synsets in total with 1536 words.The detail distribution of the emotion words aswell as the synsets in the six different lists accord-ing to their POS is shown in Table 1.
Hence, wehave expanded the lists with adequate number ofemotion words using SentiWordNet before at-tempting any translation of the lists into Japanese.SentiWordNet assigns each synset of WordNet withtwo coarse grained subjective scores such as posi-tive and negative along with an objective score.SentiWordNet contains more number of coarsegrained emotional words than WordNet Affect.
Weassumed that the translation of the coarse grainedemotional words into Japanese might contain moreor less fine-grained emotion words.
One exampleentry of the SentiWordNet is shown below.
ThePOS of the entry is followed by a synset ID, posi-tive and negative scores and synsets containingsentiment words.SentiWordNet:a 121184  0.25 0.25 infuri-ated#a#1 furious#a#2 maddened#a#1 en-raged#a#1 angered#a#1Our aim is to increase the number of emotionwords in the WordNet Affect using SentiWordNet,both of which are developed from the WordNet.Hence, each word of the WordNet Affect is re-placed by the equivalent synsets retrieved fromSentiWordNet if the synset contains that emotionword.
The POS information in the WordNet Affectis kept unchanged during expansion.
A related ex-ample is shown in Figure 2.
The distributions ofexpanded synsets and words for each of the sixemotion classes based on four different POS types(noun N, verb V, adjective Adj.
and adverb Adv.
)are shown in Table 1.
But, we have kept the dupli-cate entries at synset level for identifying the emo-tion related scores in our future attempts byutilizing the already associated positive and nega-tive scores of SentiWordNet.
The percentage ofentries in the updated word lists are increased by69.77 and 74.60 at synset and word levels.3.3 Translation of Expanded WordNet Affectinto JapaneseWe have mapped the affectID of the WordNet Af-fect to the corresponding synsetID of the WordNet3.0.
This mapping helps to expand the WordNetAffect with the recent version of SentiWordNet 3.0as well as translating the expanded lists into Japa-nese using the Japanese WordNet (Bond et al,2009).82EmotionClassesWordNet Affect Synset (S) and Word (W) [After SentiWordNet updating]N V Adj AdvS W S W S W S WAnger 48 [198] 99 [403] 19 [103] 64 [399] 39 [89] 120 [328] 21 [23] 35 [50]Disgust 3 [17] 6 [21] 6 [21] 22 [62] 6  [38] 34  [230] 4  [5] 10 [19]Fear 23[89] 45 [224] 15  [48] 40 [243] 29  [62] 97  [261] 15 [21] 26 [49]Joy 73 [375] 149 [761] 40 [252] 122 [727] 84  [194] 203 [616] 30  [45] 65 [133]Sadness 32 [115] 64 [180] 10  [43] 33 [92] 55 [129] 169 [779] 26 [26] 43 [47]Surprise 5 [31]    8 [28] 7  [42] 28 [205] 12  [33] 41  [164] 4  [6] 13 [28]Table 1: Number of POS based Synsets and Words in six WordNet Affect lists before and after updatingusing SentiWordNetLinked Affect word:n#05587878 ??

There were a large number of wordcombinations, collocations and idioms in the Japa-nese WordNet Affect.
These parts of synsets showproblems during translation and therefore manual83translation is carried out for these types.
Some ofthe English synsets (?07517292-n lividity?)
werenot translated into Japanese.
But, an equivalentgloss of the word ?lividity?
that is present in theJapanese WordNet is ?a state of fury so great theface becomes discolored?.
One of the reasons ofsuch translation problems may be that no equiva-lent Japanese word sense is available for such Eng-lish words.4 Evaluation and AnalysisWe have evaluated the lexical coverage of the de-veloped Japanese WordNet Affect on a small emo-tional judgment corpus and SemEval 2007 affectsensing corpus.4.1 Evaluation on Judgment CorpusThe judgment corpus that is being developed bythe Japan System Applications Co. Ltd. 8 containsonly 100 sentences of emotional judgments.
But,this corpus is not an open source till date.
We haveevaluated our Japanese WordNet Affect based base-line system on these 100 sentences and the resultsfor each of the six emotion classes are shown inTable 4.
We have also incorporated an open sourcemorphological analyzer9 in our baseline system.The algorithm is that, if a word in a sentence ispresent in any of the Japanese WordNet Affect lists;the sentence is tagged with the emotion label cor-responding to that affect list.
But, if any word isnot found in any of the six lists, each word of thesentence is passed through the morphologicalprocess to identify its root form which is searchedthrough the Japanese WordNet Affect lists again.
Ifthe root form is found in any of the six JapaneseWordNet Affect lists, the sentence is tagged accor-dingly.
Otherwise, the sentence is tagged as non-emotional or neutral.
The average F-Score of thebaseline system has been improved by 4.1% withrespect to the six emotion classes.
Due to the fewernumber of sentential instances in some emotionclasses (e.g., joy, sadness, surprise), the perfor-mance of the system gives poor results even afterincluding the morphological knowledge.
One ofthe reasons may be the less number of words andsynset entries in some WordNet Affect lists (e.g.,fear).
Hence, we have aimed to translate the Eng-8 http://www.jsa.co.jp/9 http://mecab.sourceforge.net/lish SemEval 2007 affect sensing corpus into Japa-nese and evaluate our system on the translated cor-pus.EmotionClasses(#Sentences)Judgment Corpus (in %)Before Morphology [After Mor-phology]Precision Recall F-ScoreAnger(#32)51.61[64.29]50.00[68.12]50.79[66.14]disgust(#18)25.00[45.00]5.56[10.56]9.09[17.10]fear (#33) NULLjoy(#3)3.45[8.08]66.67[100.00]6.56[14.95]Sadness  (#5) NULLsurprise(#9)6.90[13.69]22.22[33.33]10.53[19.41]Table 4: Precision, Recall and F-Scores (in %)of the system per emotion class on the Judgmentcorpus by including and excluding morphology.4.2 Evaluation on Translated SemEval 2007Affect Sensing CorpusThe English SemEval 2007 affect sensing corpusconsists of news headlines only.
Each of the newsheadlines is tagged with a valence score and scoresfor all the six Ekman?s emotions.
The six emotionscores for each sentence are in the range of 0 to100.
We have considered that each sentence is as-signed a single sentential emotion tag based on themaximum emotion score out of six annotated emo-tion scores.
We have used the Google translatorAPI 10to translate the 250 and 1000 sentences ofthe trial and test sets of the SemEval 2007 corpusrespectively.
The experiments regarding morphol-ogy and emotion scores are conducted on the trialcorpus.
We have carried out different experimentson 1000 test sentences by selecting different rangesof emotion scores.
The corresponding experimentalresults are also shown in Table 5.
Incorporation ofmorphology improves the performance of the sys-tem.
On the other hand, it is observed that the per-formance of the system decreases by increasing therange of Emotion Scores (ES).
The reason may bethat the numeric distribution of the sentential in-stances in each of the emotion classes decreases asthe range in emotion scores increases.10 http://translate.google.com/#84EmotionClassesJapanese Translated SemEval 2007 Test Corpus (in %)Before Morphology [After Morphology]Emotion Score (ES) ?

We deal with phrases using Japanesemorphology tool to find affect words in a sentenceand substitute an affect word into its original con-jugated form.
One of the main reasons of using amorphology tool is to analyze the conjugated formand to identify the phrases.
For example, the Japa-nese word for the equivalent English word ?anger?is "??
(o ko ru)" but there are other conjugatedword forms such as "???
(o ko tta)" that means?angered?
and it is used in past tense.
Similarly,other conjugated form "?????
(o ko tte i ta)"denotes the past participle form ?have angered?
ofthe original word ?anger?.
The morphological formof its passive sense is "????
(o ko ra re ru)"that means ?be angered?.
We identify the wordforms from their corresponding phrases by usingthe morpheme information.
For example, thephrase "????
(o ko ra re ru)" consists of twowords, one is ???
(o ko ra) that is in an imper-fective form and other word is "??
(re ru) whichis in an original form.
The original form of the im-perfective word ??
(o ko ra) is "??
(o koru)".
It has been found that some of the Englishmulti-word phrases have no equivalent Japanesephrase available.
Only the equivalent Japanesewords are found in Japanese WordNet.
For example, the following synset contains a multi-wordphrase ?see-red?.
Instead of any equivalent phrases,only words are found in Japanese WordNet.01787106-v anger, see -red ?

?5 ConclusionThe present paper describes the preparation of Jap-anese WordNet Affect containing six types of emo-tion words in six separate lists.
The automaticapproach of expanding, translating and sense dis-ambiguation tasks reduces the manual effort.
Theresource is still being updated with more numberof emotional words to increase the coverage.
Thesense disambiguation task needs to be improvedfurther in future by incorporating more number oftranslators and considering their agreement intoaccount.
In future we will adopt a corpus-drivenapproach for updating the resource with morenumber of emotion words and phrases for extend-ing the emotion analysis task in Japanese.AcknowledgmentsThe work reported in this paper is supported by agrant from the India-Japan Cooperative Pro-gramme (DST-JST) 2009 Research project entitled?Sentiment Analysis where AI meets Psychology?funded by Department of Science and Technology(DST), Government of India.85ReferencesAndreevskaia A. and Bergler Sabine.
