upenn, eduAbst ractTraditional approaches to quantifier scopetypically need stipulation to exclude rea-dings that are unavailable to human under-standers.
This paper shows that quantifierscope phenomena can be precisely charac-terized by a semantic representation cons-trained by surhce constituency, if the di-stinction between referential and quantifi-cational NPs is properly observed.
A CCGimplementation is described and comparedto other approaches.1 In t roduct ionIt is generally assumed that sentences with multi-ple quantified NPs are to be interpreted by one ormore unambiguous logical forms in which the scopeof traditional logical quantifiers determines the rea-ding or readings.
There are two problems with thisassumption: (a) without further stipulation there isa tendency to allow too many readings and (b) thereis considerable confusion as to how many readingsshould be allowed arising from contamination of thesemantics of many NL quantifiers by referentiality.There are two well-known techniques for redis-tributing quantifiers in quantification structures:quantifying-in (Montague, 1974; Cooper, 1983; Kel-ler, 1988; Carpenter, 1994) and quantifier raising(May, 1985).
The former provides a compositio-nal way of putting possibly embedded quantifiersto the scope-taking positions, and the latter utili-zes a syntactic movement operation at the level ofsemantics for quantifier placement.
There are alsoapproaches that put more emphasis on utilizing con-textual information in restricting the generation ofsemantic forms by choosing a scope-neutral repre-sentation augmented with ordering constraints tocapture linguistic judgments (Webber, 1979; Kamp,1981; Helm, 1983; Poesio, 1991; Reyle, 1993).
Andthere are computational pproaches that screen una-vailable and/or redundant semantic forms (HobbsShieber, 1987; Moran, 1988; Vestre, 1991).
This pa-per will show that these approaches allow unavaila-ble readings, and thereby miss an important gene-ralization concerning the readings that actually areavailable.This paper examines English constructions thatallow multiple occurrences of quantified NPs: NPmodifications, transitive or ditransitive verbs, thatcomplements, and coordinate structures.
Based ona critical analysis of readings that are available fromthese data, the claim is that scope phenomena canbe characterized by a combination of syntactic sur-face adjacency and semantic function-argument re-lationship.
This characterization will draw upon theold distinction between referential and quantificatio-nal NP-semantics (Fodor & Sag, 1982).
We chooseto use Combinatory Categorial Grammar to showhow surface adjacency affects semantic function-argument relationship, since CCG has the flexibilityof composing almost any pair of adjacent constitu-ents with a precise notion of syntactic grammatica-lity (Steedman, 1990; 1993).
zThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.
First,we discuss in ?2 how traditional techniques addressavailability of readings and note some residual pro-blems.
Then we give a brief analysis of availablereadings (?3), a generalization of the analysis (?4),and finally describe acomputational implementationin Prolog (~5).2 T rad i t iona l  ApproachesAll three paradigms of grammar formalisms intro-duced earlier share similar linguistic judgments fortheir grammaticality analyses.
This section exami-nes quantifying-in to show (a) that quantifying-in is a powerful device that allows referential NP-interpretations and (b) that quantifying-in snot suf-ficiently restricted to account for the available rea-dings for quantificational NP-interpretations.Quantifying-in is a technique originally introdu-ced to produce appropriate semantic forms for dere interpretations of NPs inside opaque operators1 For instance, the result would transfer to Synchro-nous "I~ee Adjoining Grammar (Shieber & Schabes,1990) without much change.205(Montague, 1974).
For example, (a) below has tworeadings, de re and de dicto, depending on the rela-tivity of the existence of such an individual.
Theyare roughly interpretable as (b) and (@2(1) (a) John believes that a Republican will win.
(b) 3r.repub(r) A bel(john, ui l l (u in(r)))(C) bel(john, 3r.repub(r) A uill(uin(r)))(b) has a binder 3 that is quaati.fving a variable rinside an opaque operator bel, hence the name forthe technique.
(c) does not have such an interven-ing operator.
Although it is beyond the scope of thepresent paper to discuss further details of intensio-nality, it is clear that de re interpretations of NPsare strongly related to referential NP-semantics, inthe sense that the de re reading of (a) is about areferred individual and not about an arbitrary suchindividual.
Quantifying-in s designed to make any(possibly embedded) NP take the matrix scope, byleaving a scoped variable in the argument positionof the original NP.
This would be acceptable for re-ferential NP-semantics.Montague also proposed to capture purely exten-sional scope ambiguities using quantifying-in.
Forexample, wide scope reading of a woman in (a) belowis accounted for by quantifying-in (with a meaningpostulate), patterned after one for (b).
(2) (a) Every man loves a woman.
(b) Every man seeks a white unicorn.His suggestion is adopted with various subsequentrevisions cited earlier.
Since any NP, referential orquantificational, requires quantifying-in to outscopeanother, quantifying-in consequently confounds re-ferential and quantificational NP-semantics.
Thiscauses a problem when there is a distributional dif-ference between referential NPs and non-referentialNPs, as Fodor & Sag (1982) have argued, a viewwhich has been followed by the approaches to dy-namic interpretation f indefinite NPs cited earlier.It seems hard to reconcile quantifying-in with theseobservations.3 Ava i lab i l i ty  o f  Read ingsThis section proposes a way of sharpening our intui-tion on available readings and re-examines traditio-nal linguistic judgments on grammatical readings.While there are undoubted ifferences in degreeof availability among readings dependent upon se-mantics or discourse preference (Bunt, 1985; Moran,1988), we will focus on all-or-none structural possi-bilities afforded by competence grammar.
32In this simplistic notation, we gloss over tense ana-lysis, among others.3Moran's preference-based algorithm treats certainreadings as "highly unpreferred," effectively makingthem structurally unavailable, from those possible sco-Consider the following unambiguous quantifica-tion structure in a generalized quantifier format(hereafter oq, Barwise & Cooper, 1981), wherequant i f ie r  outscopes any quantifiers that may oc-cur in either res t r i c t ion  or body.
(3) quantif ier(variable, restr ict ion,  body)Logical forms as notated this way make explicit thefunctional dependency between the denotations oftwo ordered quantificational NPs.
For example~ con-sider (4) (a) (Partee, 1975).
(b) shows one way ofrepresenting it in a GQ format.
(4) (a) Three Frenchmen visited five Russians.
(b) three(f ,  frenchmen(f), f ive(r ,russians (r), v is i ted(f ,  r) ) )We can always argue, by enriching the notation, that(4) (b) represents at least four different readings, de-pending on the particular sense of each involved NP,i.e., group- vs individual-denoting.
In every suchreading, however, the truth of (4) (b) depends uponfinding appropriate individuals (or the group) for fsuch that each of those individuals (or the groupitself) gets associated with appropriate individuals(or a group of individuals) for r via the relationv is i l ;ed .
4 Notice that there is always a funct ionaldependency of individuals denoted by r upon indi-viduals denoted by f. We claim that this explicitfunctional dependency an be utilized to test availa-bility of readings.
5First, consider the following sentences withoutcoordination.
(5) (a) Two representatives of three companiessaw most samples.
(b) Every dealer shows most customers atmost three cars.
(c) Most boys think that every man dancedwith two women.
(a) has three quantifiers, and there are 6 differentways of ordering them.
Hobbs & Shieber (1987)show that among these, the reading in which two re-presentatives outscopes most samples which in turnoutscopes three companies is not available from thesentence.
They attribute the reason to the logicalstructure of English as in (3), as it is consideredunable to afford an unbound variable, a constraintknown as the unbound variable constraint (uvc).
6We should note, however, that there is one readingpings generated by a scheme similar to Hobbs & Shieber(1887).
We clash that competence grammax makes evenfewer eadings available in the first place.4Without losing generality, therefore, we will consideronly individual-denoting NPs in this paper.SSingular NPs such as a company are not helpful tothis task since their denotations do not involve multi-ple individuals which explicitly induce this functionaldependency.eThe reading would be represented as follows, whichhas the first occurrence of the variable c left unbound.206among the remaining five that the uvc  allows whichin fact does not appear to be available.
This is theone in which three companies outscopes most samp-les which in turn outscopes two representatives (cf.Horn (1972), Fodor (1982)).
7 This suggests thatthe uvc  may not be the only principle under whichHobbs & Shieber's reading is excluded, s The otherfour readings of (a) are self-evidently available.
Ifwe generalize over available readings, they are onlythose that have no quantifiers which intercalate overNP boundaries.
9(5) (b) has three quantifiers too, but unlike (5)(a), all the six ways of ordering the quantifiers areavailable.
(5) (c) has only four available readings,where most boys does not intercalate very man andtwo women.
1?Consider now sentences including coordination.
(6) (a) Every girl admired, but most boys dete-sted, one of the saxophonists.
(b) Most boys think that every man dancedwith, but doubt that a few boys talked to,more than two women.As Geach (1970) pointed out, (a) has only two gram-matical readings, though it has three quantifiers.
Inreading 1, the same saxophonist was admired anddetested at the same time.
In reading 2, every girladmired an arbitrary saxophonist and most boysalso detested an arbitrary saxophonist.
In particu-lar, missing readings include the one in which everygirl admired the same saxophonist and most boysdetested the same but another saxophonist.
(6) (b)rio(r, rep(r) It of(r,c), most(a, samp(s),three(c ,  comp(c), sag( r , s ) ) ) )7To paraphrase this impossible reading, it is true of asituation under which there were three companies suchthat there were four samples for each such company suchthat each such sample was seen by two representatives ofthat company.
Crucially, samples een by representativesof different companies were not necessarily the same.SThis should not be taken as denying the reality of theuvc itself.
For example, as one of the referees pointedout, the uvc is required to explain why, in (a) below,every professor must outscope a friend so as to bind thepronoun his.
(a) Most students talked to a friend of every pro-fessor about his work.9One can replace most samples with other complexNP such as most samples of at least five products to seethis.
Certain sentences that apparently escape this ge-nerafization will be discussed in the next section.1?To see why they are available, it is enough to seethat (a) and (b) below have two readings each.
(a) 3ohn thinks that every man danced with twowomen.
(b) Most boys think that Bill danced with twowomen.also has only two grammatical readings.
In one,most boys outscopes every man and a few boys whichtogether outscope more than two women.
In theother, more than two women outscopes every manand a few boys, which together outscope most boys.4 An  Account  o f  Ava i lab i l i tyThis section proposes a generalization at the level ofsemantics for the phenomena described earlier andconsiders its apparent counterexamples.Consider a language ?
for natural language se-mantics that explicitly represents function-argumentrelationships (Jackendoff, 1972).
Suppose that in ?
:the semantic form of a quantified NP is a syntacticargument of the semantic form of a verb or a pre-position.
(7) through (10) below show well-formedexpressions in ?.11(7) v is i t ld ( f i ve ( ru l s i im)  ,thrse(frenclui in))(8) saw(most (sanp) ,of (thres(cmap) ,two(rap)))(9) show (three(car) ,most (cstmr), every(dlr))(10) think(Adlmced(two(woman) ,every(nan)),most (boy))For instance, of  has two arguments three(comp)and two(rep) ,  and show has three arguments./: gives rise to a natural generalization of availablereadings as summarized below.
12(11) For a function with n arguments, there aren!
ways of successively providing all the ar-guments to the function.This generalization captures the earlier observationsabout availability of readings.
(7), for (4) (a), hastwo (2!)
readings, as v ia i ted  has two arguments.
(8) is an abstraction for four (2!x2!)
readings, asboth of and maw have two arguments each.
(9) is anabstraction for six (3!)
readings, as show has threearguments.
Likewise, (10) is an abstraction for fourreadings.Coordination gives an interesting constraint onavailability of readings.
Geach's observation that(6) (a) has two readings uggests that the scope ofthe object must be determined before it reduces withthe coordinate fragment.
Suppose that the non-standard constituent for one of the conjuncts in (6)(a) has a semantic representation shown below.
(12) ~z adni red(z ,svery(g i r l ) )Geach's observation implies that (12) is ambiguous,so that every(girl) can still take wide (or narrow)scope with respect to the unknown argument.
A11The up-operator ^ in (10) takes a term of type t toa term of type e, but a further description of ?
is notrelevant to the present discussion.12Nan (1991)'s work is based on a related observation,though he does not make use of the distinction betweenreferential and quantificational NP-semantics.207theory of CCG will be described in the next sec-tion to show how to derive scoped logical forms foravailable readings only.But first we must consider some apparent coun-terexamples to the generalization,(13) (a) Three hunters shot at five tigers.
(b) Every representative of a company sawmost samples.The obvious reading for (a) is called conjunctive orcumulative (Partee, 1975; Webber 1979).
In thisreading, there are three hunters and five tigers suchthat shooting events happened between the two par-ties.
Here, arguments are not presented in succes-sion to their function, contrary to the present gene-ralization.
Notice, however, that the reading musthave two (or more) referential NPs (Higginbotham,1987).
13 The question is whether our theory shouldpredict this possibility as well.
For a precise notionof availability, we claim that we must appeal to thedistinction between referential and quantificationalNP-semantics, ince almost any referential NP canhave the appearance of taking the matrix scope, wi-thout affecting the rest of scope phenomena.
A re-lated example is (b), where in one reading a referen-tial NP a company arguably outscopes most sampleswhich in turn outscopes every representative (Hobbs& Shieber, 1987).
As we have pointed out earlier,the reading does not generalize to quantified NPs ingeneral.
(14) (a) Some student will investigate two dia-lects of every language.
(b) Some student will investigate two dia-lects of, and collect all interesting examp-les of coordination in, every language.
(c) * Two representative of at least threecompanies touched, but of few universi-ties saw, most samples.
(a) has a reading in which every language outscopessome student which in turn outscopes two dialects(May, 1985).
In a sense, this has intercalating NPquantifiers, an apparent problem to our generaliza-tion.
However, the grammaticality of (b) opens upthe possibility that the two conjuncts can be repre-sented grammatically as functions of arity two, si-milar to normal transitive verbs.
Notice that thegeneralization is not at work for the fragment of atleast three companies touched in (c), since the con-junct is syntactically ungrammatical.
At the end ofnext section, we show how these finer distinctionsare made under the CCG framework (See discussionof Figure 5).IZFor example, (a) below lacks such a reading.
(a) Several men danced with few women.5 A CCG ImplementationThis section describes a CCG approach to derivingscoped logical forms so that they range over onlygrammatical readings.We will not discuss details of how CCG charac-terizes natural anguage syntactically, and refer theinterested reader to Steedman (1993).
CCGs makeuse of a limited set of combinators, type raising (T),function composition (B), and function substitution(S), with directionality of combination for syntac-tic grammaticality.
For the examples in this pa-per, we only need type raising and function composi-tion, along with function application.
The followingshows rules of derivation that we use.
Each rule isassociated with a label, such as > or <B etc, shownat the end.
(15) (a) x/v ~ => x (>)(b) Y x\~ => x (<)(c) x/v Y/Z => x/z  (>a)(d) Y\z x\Y ffi> x\z  (<e)(e) np => T/(T\np) (>T)(f) np => T\(T/np) (<T)The mapping from syntax to semantics i  usuallydefined in two different ways.
One is to use ele-mentary categories, such as np or s, in encodingboth syntactic types and logical forms (Jowsey, 1990;Steedman, 1990; Park, 1992).
The other is to asso-ciate the entire lexical category with a higher-orderexpression (Kulick, 1995).
In this paper, we take theformer alternative to describe a first-order enderingof CCG.Some lexical entries for every are shown below.
(16) (s :q -every  (X, N, S ) / ( s  : S \np : I )  ) /n :X 'N(17) (s : S/(a : Sknp: s-every(1) ) )/n:WThe information (s / ( s \np) ) /n  encodes the syntac-tic fact that every is a constituent which, whena constituent of category n is provided on itsright, returns a constituent of category s / ( s \np) .q-every(X,l i ,S) is a term for scoped logical forms.We are using different lexical items, for instanceq-every  and e -every  for every, in order to signifytheir semantic differences.
14 These lexical entriesare just two instances of a general schema for type-raised categories of quantifiers hown below, whereT is an arbitrary category.
(18) (T/(T\np))/na~d (T\(T/np))/nAnd the semantic part of (16) and (17) is first-orderencoding of (19) (a) and (b), respectively.
1514q-every represents every as a quantifier, ands-every,  as a set denoting property.
We willuse s-every(l^man(X)) and its ~-reduced equivalents-every(man) interchangeably.1as-quantifier(noun) denotes an arbitrary set N ofindividuals d such that d has the property noun and thatthe cardinality of N is determined by quantif ier (and208(19) (a) ~n.AP.Vz E s-every(n).P(=)(b)(a) encodes wide scope type raising and (b), narrow.With standard entries for verbs as in (20), logicalforms such as (21) and (22) are po ible.

In (a), n : I ' !

(a)shows a derivation for a reading in which object NPtakes wide scope and (b) shows a derivation for a rea-ding in which subject NP takes wide scope.
Thereare also other derivations.Figure 2 shows logical forms that can be derived inthe present framework from Geach's entence.
No-tice that the conjunction forces ubject NP to be firstcomposed with the verb, so that subject NP must betype-raised and be combined with the semantics ofthe transitive verb.
As noted earlier, the two catego-ries for the object still make both scope possibilitiesavailable, as desired.
The following category is usedfor but.
(23) ((s : and(P ,1~)/np:\]\[)\ (s:P/np:\]\[))/(s :Q/np :\]\[)Readings that involve intercalating quantifiers, uchas the one where every girl outscopes one sazopho-nist, which in turn outscopes most bogs, are correctlyexcluded.Figure 3 shows two different derivations of logi-cal forms for the complex NP two representatives ofthree companies.
(a) shows a derivation for a rea-ding in which the modifying NP takes wide scopeand (b) shows the other case.
In combination withderivations involving transitive verbs with subjectand object NPs, such as ones in Figure 1, this cor-rectly accounts for four grammatical readings for (5)(a).
16Figure 4 shows a derivation for a reading, amongsix, in which most customers outscopes every dealerwhich in turn outscopes three cars.
Some of thesereadings become unavailable when the sentence con-tains coordinate structure, such as one below.
(24) Every dealer shows most customers (at most)three cars but most mechanics every car.noun).
We conjecture that this can also be made to cap-ture several related NP-semantics, uch as collective NP-semantics and/or referential NP-semantics, though wecan not discuss further details here.lSAs we can see in Figure 3 (a) (b), there m noway quantifiers inside $ can be placed between the twoquantifiers two & three, correctly excluding the othertwo readings.In particular, (24) does not have those two readingsin which every dealer intercalates most customersand three cars.
This is exactly predicted by the pre-sent CCG framework, extending Geach's observa-tion regarding (6) (a), since the coordination forcesthe two NPs, most customers and three cars, to becomposed first (Dowty, 1988; Steedman 1990; Park1992).
(25) through (27) show one such derivation,which results in readings where three cars outscopesmost customers but every dealer must take eitherwide or narrow scope with respect o both most cu-stomers and three cars.

It is a conjoinable constituent, butsince there is no way of using type-raised categoryfor two for a successful derivation, two dialects cannot outscope any other NPs, such as subject NP orthe modifying NP (Steedman, 1992).
This correctlyaccounts for our intuition that (14) (a) has an ap-parently intercalating reading and that (14) (b) hasonly two readings.
However, there is no similar deri-vation for the fragment of three companies touched,as shown below.

This result is in principle available to otherparadigms that invoke operations like QR at LF ortype-lifting, which are essentially equivalent to ab-straction.

Ap-parent counterexamples to the generalization can beexplained by the well-known distinction between re-ferential and quantificational NP-semantics.
An im-plementation f the theory for an English fragmenthas been written in Prolog, simulating the 2nd orderproperties.There is a question of how the non-standard sur-face structures of CCG are compatible with well-known conditions on binding and control (includingcrossover).
These conditions are typically stated onstandard syntactic dominance relations, but theserelations are no longer uniquely derivable once CCGallows non-standard surface structures.
We canshow, however, that by making use of the obliquen-ess hierarchy (of.
Jackendoff (1972) and much sub-sequent work) at the level of LF, rather than sur-face structure, it is possible to state such conditions(Steedman, 1993).AcknowledgementsSpecial thanks to Mark Steedman.
