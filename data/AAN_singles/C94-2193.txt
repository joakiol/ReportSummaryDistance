PRESUPPOSITION & VP-ELLIPSIS*Johan Bos(bos@col i .
uni-sb, de)Universitgt des Saarlandes, Computerl inguistikPostfach 1150, D-66041 Saarbrficken, GermanyAbst rac tWe discuss a treatment of VP-ellipsis resolutionin DRT in general, and particularly cases wherethe source clause of the elliptical VP containspresupposition triggers.
We propose to restrainVP-elfipsis resolution by presupposition neutrali-zation.
We view presupposition as a kind of ana-phora, with the ability to accommodate an ante-cedent if not provided by discourse.1 In t roduct ionIn this paper we discuss the treatment of VP-ellipsis resolution in general, and particularly itsinteraction with presupposition.
We share the opi=nion of those who argue that ellipsis resolutionshould take place at a semantic level \[Dalrympleet al, 1991; Kehler, 1993; Sere, 1993\].
We willprovide a framework in which ellipsis resolutionis constrained by presupposition projection, andfurthermore, anaphora nd presupposition are re-presented underspecified in the semantics.The latter postulation is necessary for a propertreatment of VP-ellipsis on the semantic level.The source clause of an elliptical VP often con-tains presupposition triggers, and resolution of theelided VP asks for presupposition projection inthe context of the target elliptical clause.
This isan issue which has been neglected in the literaturehitherto.The other thesis we put forward in this paper isthat VP-ellipsis resolution is constrained by pre-supposition.
Every elided VP is evidently escortedby some presupposition trigger.
The cases we willpursue through this paper is the presupposition*This work was partly funded by the German Ministryfor Research and Technology (BMFT) under contract 01IV 101 k/1 (VERBMOBIL).introduced by focusing particles uch as too.Of our interest are examples like:(1) John kicked his dog, and Tom did, too.
(2) With Betty, John visited her parents,and with MARY, he did, too.Example (1) presupposes that only John owns adog (in the strict reading), or presupposes thatboth John and Tom own a dog (in the sloppy rea-ding).
Example (2) shows that this strict/sloppyambiguity also occurs in cases where there is anon-subject parallelism.We use the level of discourse representation forVP-ellipsis resolution, in an extension of DiscourseRepresentation Theory \[Kamp, 1981\].
For the re-construction of elided material we adopt a versionof Asher's Concept Abstraction mechanism \[As-her, 1993\].We furthermore integrate Van der Sandt's pre-supposition projection algorithm \[1992\].
Van derSandt argues that presuppositions are kind of ana-phoric expressions which interpretation is stronglyinfluenced by discourse structure.
The main dif-ference to pronouns is that presuppositions havemore descriptive content, which enables them toaccommodate an antecedent, in case not providedby discourse.2 DRT- f rameworkIn this section I will outline a proper frameworkthat integrates anaphora resolution, presupposi-tion projection, and ellipsis resolution.
Basically,we will extend Kamp's Discourse RepresentationTheory slightly, by integrating the treatment ofpresupposition of Van der Sandt and reference to1784abstract entities by Asher.
What  is new is thecombination of these three formalisms into one,leading to interesting results concerning the ana-lysis of VP-ellipsis.\])RT focuses on the semantic interpretation of dis-courses.
A major aspect of I)RT is the use of Dis-course Representation Structures that hold the se-inantic content of sentences as a pair < U, C >, inwhich U is a set of discourse markers (referents)and C a set of conditions upon them.
The fullsyntax of DRSs is given in Definition 1.Def in i t ion  1: DRS Syntax1.
If U is a set of reference markers, C a setof conditions, then the pair < Uq~,C?
> is a1)RS I~;2.
If P is n-place predicate constant and t l  .
.
.t~ are terms, then P( t l  .
.
.
tn) is a condition;3.
If (i) and g~ are DRSs, then ~ (P, ?
=> qJ and(I) V ?
are conditions4.
If (I) is a I)RS, P a predicative I)RS, t l ,  t2 areterms, then ~(h,t2):(I), cP (h)  and h :O areconditions.Clause (2) forms atomic conditions.
Clause (3)states negation, universal quantification, and dis-junction.
Clause (4) defines anaphoric, ellipticalmaterial, and propositions and deserves more at-tention because it deviates from Kamp's originalproposal.
In our framework we introduce the alfa-condition (~:~) which functions to indicate thatthe information in \])\]IS ~ must be anaphoricallyLinked to previously established iscourse markers.It has two additional arguments, one for indica-ting the prhlcipal referent of the anaphoric con-struction, and (optional) one for stating the ante-cedent.
So a condition c~(x,y):~ states that y isthe antecedent for x~ under restriction of (I).In the case of pronouns, e0 only contains discoursemarkers and no conditions.
But in the case of, forexample, definite descriptions, (I) carries the re-strictions in its conditions for linking the discoursemarker associated to the definite description to anearlier introduced marker.Referential constructions such as ellipsis andevent-type anaphora, are not linked to discoursemarkers but, instead, refer to portions of dis-course, and are indicated by e: P( t ) ,  where P isan abstracted piece of the previous DRS.
Resolu-tion of epsilon-conditions is done by applying theabstracted DRS P to its argument .Alfa- and epsilon conditions do not c~rry any sub-ordination relations with respect to other DRSs,and neither do propositional conditions.
Theyare, in contrast o the sub-DRSs formulated underclause (3), accessible for anaphoric relations andinherit the subordination relations of the I)RS inwhich they are situated.Ellipsis resolution is done by a process called C-Abstraction (cf.
Asher 1993, p. 249).
It is statedin a simplified form as:Definition 2: C-Abstraction for VP:ellipsis(Asher )1.
If c:P(t) is a condition in DRS K and is de-rived from auxiliary do, then P may be iden-tiffed with Ay.K*, where K* is an alphabeticvariant of a part of K.2.
K* is underspecified for alfa- and epsilon-conditions.While parsing a sequence of sentences, we aS-sume tile following: firstly, we have got ~ proper I)RS of the sentences that we have parsed sofar, and secondly, a compositional bottom-up con-struction procedure that returns the DRS of theactual sentence, which is called the sentence-l)RS(henceforth s-I)RS).An s-DRS is in a sense underspecified, because allanaphoric material that it includes is still unresol-.ved.
On the representationM level this is markedby leaving the optionM slot in the Mfu-conditionfor the antecedent untilled.
Anaphoric materialcontains, besides the 'normal'  anaphors, also allpresuppositioual information of the sentence un-der consideration.
Accordingly all presuppositioninducers are marked as such in the lexicon.3 Presupposition ProjectionIn this section we will show how presupposi-tion projection (aild hence, anaphora resolution)is treated in I)RT.
The Mgorithm I present isin essence conform to Van der Sandt's proposal\[Van der Sandt, 1992\].
Van der Sandt's theoryis principally based on two mechanisms: binding1185and accommodation.
Compared to classical pre-supposition theories, the former corresponds byand large to presupposition cancellation (or bet-ter: neutralization), while the latter is sort of re-pairing the discourse in the style of Lewis \[1979\].The idea of Van der Sandt's work is that "anapho-ric expressions are either linked to some previouslyestablished antecedent or, if they have enough de-scriptive content, accommodated at some level ofrepresentation" \[Van der Sandt, 1992\].
All ana-phoric information is resolved (under normal cir-cumstances), conform the following rules:1.
Try to bind the anaphoric material to an ac-cessible antecedent.2.
If (1) fails, accommodate an antecedent.Accommodation must take place at some accessi-ble level of discourse.
It has been argued in theliterature that accommodation must take place asglobal as possible.
\[Helm, 1983; Van der Sandt,1992\].
Rather than using a non-monotone movingoperation for accommodation we obey the follo-wing algorithm:1.2.3.4.
Ready.If there is a superordinated level then (2) else(4).Copy the presupposed information to this le-vel, but only if this does not lead to semanticcontradictions (unbound variables or inconsi-stencies) or pragmatic violations, else (4).Repeat step (1).We will not elaborate in detail on the issue whichconstrains constitute the elimination of possi-ble accommodation sites.
The interested readershould consult Van der Sandt's paper (1992) forproposals.We exemplify the projection algorithm with (3)and (4).
The former presupposes John as a (togowner, the latter, in contrast, does not presupposethat, although it contains the same presuppositioninducer.
This is named the the projection problem.
(3) John beats his dog.
(4) If John has a dog, he beats his dog.The result of the compositional semantic onstruc-tion process for (4), given that presuppositions aremarked in the lexicon as anaphorical, is the follo-wing s-DRS:X2o/x ) l johXlxl, \]dog(x2 )of(x~,x~):ee.
(x~):~dog(x4)~(x,): of(x,,xs)beat(xa ,x4)This s-DRS is merged with the DRS of the pre-vious discourse, which is in this case an emptyone.
The next step is to examine the newly acqui-red conditions and see if there are any anaphoricDRSs among them.In the first place we find the condition for the pro-per name John, which is treated as a presupposi-tion.
We cannot bind this expression to a referent,since there is none available, so we accommodatethe information in the principle DRS)  Accommo-dation is simply fulfilled by copying an alphabeticvariant of the anaphoric DRS to the main DRS.Linking is possible for the personal pronoun x3 tothe (closest) referent of John.The other anaphoric DRS in the conseqnent oftile implication paraplirases his dog has an em-bedded anaphoric DRS, which has to be resolvedfirst.
In this case the referent x5 can be linkedto xl.
Finally we can resolve x4 to x2 becausetheir corresponding conditions do not conflict andyield:X6john(x6)- - -  X1~(Xl  ~X6): =~dog(x2) I Iot(x~,xl) /<xJ,xl):V  _c~tx4'x~)' I of(?4,xs)beat(xs,x4)This DRS is fully specified and paraphrases themeaning of (4) correctly: There is a male personcalled John, and if John owns a dog, he beats it.For (3), our algorithm would accommodate theinformation that John owns a dog.XNote that proper names, treated as presuppositions,arc always accommodated to the top level DRS this way,or linked to previously established markers.11864 VP-ellipsis Resolution byPresupposition ProjectionWe will explain our analysis of VP-ellipsis by ex-ample (5).
R.ecM1 that (5) is  ambiguous in whe-ther 'Ibrn is beating John's dog (the strict in-terpretation) or Tom is beating TonPs dog (thesloppy reading).
(5) John kicked Ms {log. '
Ibm did, too.Our analysis heavily relies on the interpretation offocusing particles.
No existing approach to VP-ellipsis does so, Mthough absence of presuppo-sition introducers makes interpretation of elidedVPs impossible (6).
The set of presuppositiontriggers I am referriug to includes particles liketoo, also, so, either, discourse connectives before;after, and, but and other presupposition inducerssuch as certain focusing constructions.
(6) ?
John kicked his dog.
Tom did.We will emi}hasize on the interpretation of focll-sing particles, especially, the adverb too.
Dis-course particles function to enhance the cohere.neeof discourse.
They do not add anything to themeaning of the propositi{}us they modify, but rat-her judge whether at propositions tits within theprevious {:ontext or not;.
This feature characte-rizes them as eliminators of possible readings ina given context.
It makes it impossible to un-derstand (5) as 3ohn kicked Bill's dog, and '/binkicked 51bra's dog, for example.The particle too typically is sensitive to fi)cusedobjects.

replaced by theiralternatives.
We follow Rooth \[Rooth, 1985\] intaking the fm, ction of focus to be evoking alter-native sets.
Focus determines in that respect anadditional semzmtic wflue H 1.
Ordinary semanticvalues ~.\]o are not affected by focus.
(7) \[ qbmfa  kicked his1 dog\] j = the set of propositions of the forln "x kicked x's dog"(8) ~ 'Ibm/,1 kicked his2 dog~ / = the set of pro-positions of the form "x kicked his~ dog"(9) \[ !l'om/, 1 kicked his1 dog~ ?
= the proposition"John1 kicked his1 dog"Note that pronouns with focused antecedents (7)get a referential interpretation, and pronouns withan unfocused antecedent get a bound interpreta-tion.
The semantics of too, stated in terms ofRooth's alternative semantics is consequently:(lO) too({I}): \[{iq?
(D I 7 ~ ~  (k~- I~\] \ ]  ' )The merge operation (D takes two DRSs and re-turns a new one.
The merging of I)RSs consistsin simply taking the union of the sets of discoursemarkers and the sets of conditions separately.The alfa-condition in (10) introduces the presup-position of too.
In order to preserve {:oordinafionbe.tweeu this presupposition and the asserLion, itis necessary 1;o perform ellipsis and anaphora re-solutiou befi}re the interpretation of propositionmodilying particles (;an take place.We will work out an example in detail to makeclear how resolution is restrained by presupposi-tion.
l)iscourse markers of type x, are used torange over individuals, markers of type Pl rangeover propositions.
Consider (5), paraphrased inthe following DRS:(11).

( t2)  Ay.X5.
, do~(x~)  I ~{x~)'I "  ~ ' o f (x~,x0)/kicked (y xs )1187Note that (12) is underspecified for anaphoric re-lations.
It will become part of a context distinctfrom its original one, and therefore other discoursemarkers may play the role of antecedents.
The dis-course marker x6, standing for his, can be eitherlinked to the marker corresponding to Tom, or tothe marker corresponding to John.
In the formercase we get a referential reading in the presuppo-sition because the antecedent is in focus position,in the latter case we get a bound reading.
Howe-ver, these possible readings 2 are checked for beingallowed by the presupposition i troduced by too.Applying (10) to the resolved propositional DRSP2 with the referential reading gives us the pre-supposition in (13) which allows the sloppy inter-pretation of Tom does, too:(13) p2:X4tom(x4)dog(x~)X~~(x~,x~): of(x~,x0)L_ kicked(xJ.

The resolved DRSwith the bound reading in the presupposition gi-ves us the strict interpretation of the elided VP.The presupposition stemming from too for thiscase is (14) and can also be linked to Pl.
(14) a:(p3,pl):p3jo?,:<:;)/ aog(x~)P3: / of(x~,xs)\[.
kicked(x~ ,xT)Given DRS (11), no other presuppositions can besatisfied and therefore these two readings are ex-haustive.
Because linking of presuppositions has2Which number would be larger, if there were more sui-table antecedents for x6, more possible antecedents VPs,or more alternatives for the focused object Tom.
tlowevcr,none of these readings would fulfil the requirement to bean anaphoric presupposition!in our framework a higher priority than accom-modation, readings like '/bm kicked x's donkey,where x does not equal John or Tom, are not al-lowed.Finally, note that, for the definite description hisdog, in the second case presupposition neutraliza-tion by anaphoric binding took place, while in thefirst case the presupposition was accommodated(by "assertion").5 Compar i son  to  o ther  Approa-chesI classify previous approaches to VP-ellipsis reso-lution as 1) approaches that take the antecedentVP as ambiguous, 2) approaches that pursue acopying-and-renaming mechanism, and 3) approa-ches that rely on discourse relations.
None of theapproaches to be mentioned use presupposition asmeans to restrain VP-ellipsis resolution.Source -c lause  Ambigu i ty  ApproachesThe first class of approaches to VP-ellipsis is cha-racterized by claiming that the semantics of theelided VP is identical to another VP salient in dis-course.
They treat the source clause as ambiguousin cases where there is both a strict and sloppy in-terpretation possible.
For illustration, our exam-ple (5) would allow only one of the two possibleproperties for the antecedent VP, respectively thereferential and the bound interpretation.
(15) a) Ax.
kicked(x,dog_of(x))b) Ax.
kicked(x,dog_of(john))Resolution is simply done by choosing one of thepossible sources given in (15) and apply it tothe subject of the elliptical VP.
This analysis isproposed in \[Sag, 1976\], \[Williams, 1977\], \[Klein,1987\], \[Roberts, 1987\] and \[Gawron and Peters,1990\] and are also termed "identity-of-relations"approaches in the literature.The most serious problem that these approachesface is "the postulation of wild ambiguity in thesource clause, one derivation for each possible caseof subsequent ellipsis."
\[Dalrymple t al., 1991\].Furthermore, it turns out to be impossible to hold1188on to this analysis for cases like (16):(16) With Betty, John visited her parents,and with MARY, he did, too.Example (16) also shows the strict/sloppy ambi-guity.
Our analysis predicts this, since the focusedobject is Mary, and the presupposition stemmingfrom too is either with x, John did visit x's pa-rents (sloppy reading) or with x, John did visitBetty's parents (strict reading).Copying-and-Renaming ApproachesOn the other hand, there are the 'sloppy-identity',qmn-identity', or ~flexible-copying' approaches tothe problem of ellipsis, which abandon the as-sumption that the source clause is ambiguous.Instances of these analyses are the higher orderunification and equationM analysis \[DMrymple tal., 1991\], role-based copying methods \[Kehler,1993\], and few posited in Discourse Representa-tion Theory \[B~uerle, 1988\]; \[Sem, 1993\]; andKainp (Personal communication f Kamp to Gaw-ron & Peters \[Gawron and Peters, 1990\]).Their shortcomings are, generally stated, first thatthey are forced to put additional, intricate cons-traints on resolution to omit overgeneration f rea-dings.
Second, these approaches do not include adetection of parMlelism.
They take the identifi-cation of parallel objects for granted, or assumethat the subjects of the source and target clausesare parallel (which is not necessarily the case, seee.g.
(16)).
A proper treatment of ellipsis requiresthe integration of parallelism detection betweenthe source and target clause.Our approach can also be classified as a copying-and-renaming approach, with the difference thatit uses presupposition eutralization as a na-turn constraint rather than using "artificial"constraints to restrict resolution.
Copying-and-renaming analyses generally have better predic-tions than source-clause-ambiguity approaches.The following example, for instance, is judged tohave five readings:(17) John revised his paper before the teacherdid, and Bill did, too.Our analysis generates (assuming that before in-troduces a similar presupposition as too), whenthe embedded elided VP is strictly interpreted,two readings (the corresponding presuppositionsare x revised x's paper before t revised t's pa-per, and x revised j's paper before the t revisedt's paper) and three readings when the embeddedelided VP is sloppily interpreted (here the corre-sponding presuppositions are: x revised x's paperbefore t revised x's paper, x revised j's paper be-fore t revised j's paper, and x revised x's paperbefore t revised j's paper).
These are exactly thesame readings as \[l)alrylnple t al., 1991\], \[Kehler,1993\] and \[Sem, 1993\] get in their analysis.Analyses using Discourse RelationsA quite distinct class of approaches to VP-ellipsisare those that use discourse structure to restrainresolution lasher, 1993; Gardent, 1993; Priist andScha, 1990\].
These merely built on fi'ameworksstemming from AI of whom the most famous oneis Grosz & Sidner's Discourse Structure Theory\[Grosz and Sidner, 1986\].
In order to identify theunderlying segments of discourse and their relati-ons that hold between them, interpretation ofcluewords (finguistic expressions that indicate boun-daries between discourse segments) and the pur-pose of the speaker is taken into account.
Also,one inight need knowledge of the world in the ana-lysis of segmentation.A general problem that these approaches faceis that they heavily rely on discourse relations.There definition is "notoriously elusive" \[Gardent,1993\], and an exhaustive classification is still sub-ject to future research.
Although cue phrases playan important role ill signalling topic changes indiscourse, in general another mechanism ight beneeded to find connections which are not clearlystated.
The use of speaker's intentions might benecessary but in general there is no finite set ofpossible intentions available \[Grosz and Sidner,1986\].
Another problem is the difficulty of findinga general way to incorporate world knowledge ina working system.It is unclear in how far one needs discourse in-formation for ellipsis resolution.
An interestingfuture research topic is how far presupposition,as proposed in this paper, can support this task.Take for example:(18) If John beat his donkey, Bill will too,but if he doesn't, Bill won't either.1189Although source-clause-ambiguity approachespredict the right two readings for (18), it is un-clear how copying~and-renaming a alyses wouldeliminate any mixed strict/sloppy readings wit-hout using discourse relations like contrast andparallelism.6 Conc lus ionWe proposed to perform VP-elllpsis resolution ona semantic representation level, in a DRT-styleframework.
We did so by incorporating a Van derSandtian approach to presupposition projection.This gave us means to treat interactions of VP-ellipsis with presupposition, in such a way thatwe do not need any intrinsic rules that traditio-nal copying strategies use for VP-ellipsis resolu-tion.
In this respect, emphasis was laid upon thepresupposition i troduced by the particle too, alt-hough the analysis of other discourse particles isnot expected to be much different.ReferenceslAsher, 1993\] Nicholas Asher.
