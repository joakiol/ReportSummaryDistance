eduAbst ractVerbal and compositional lexical aspectprovide the underlying temporal struc-ture of events.
Knowledge of lexical as-pect, e.g., (a)telicity, is therefore requiredfor interpreting event sequences in dis-course (Dowty, 1986; Moens and Steed-man, 1988; Passoneau, 1988), interfacingto temporal databases (Androutsopoulos,1996), processing temporal modifiers (An-tonisse, 1994), describing allowable alter-nations and their semantic effects (Resnik,1996; Tenny, 1994), and selecting tenseand lexical items for natural anguage gen-eration ((Dorr and Olsen, 1996; Klavansand Chodorow, 1992), cf.
(Slobin and Bo-caz, 1988)).
We show that it is possibleto represent lexical aspect--both verbaland compositional--on a large scale, us-ing Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS)representations of verbs in the classes cat-aloged by Levin (1993).
We show howproper consideration of these universalpieces of verb meaning may be used torefine lexical representations and derive arange of meanings from combinations ofLCS representations.
A single algorithmmay therefore be used to determine l xicalaspect classes and features at both verbaland sentence levels.
Finally, we illustratehow knowledge of lexical aspect facilitatesthe interpretation of events in NLP appli-cations.1 IntroductionKnowledge of lexical aspect--how verbs denote situ-ations as developing or holding in time--is requiredfor interpreting event sequences in discourse (Dowty,1986; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passoneau, 1988),interfacing to temporal databases (Androutsopou-los, 1996), processing temporal modifiers (Antonisse,1994), describing allowable alternations and their se-mantic effects (Resnik, 1996; Tenny, 1994), and forselecting tense and lexical items for natural anguagegeneration ((Dorr and Olsen.
1996: Klavans andChodorow, 1992), cf.
(Slobin and Bocaz, 1988)).
Inaddition, preliminary pyscholinguistic experiments(Antonisse, 1994) indicate that subjects are sensi-tive to the presence or absence of aspectual featureswhen processing temporal modifiers.
Resnik (1996)showed that the strength of distributionally derivedselectional constraints helps predict whether verbscan participate in a class of diathesis alternations.with aspectual properties of verbs clearly influenc-ing the alternations of interest.
He also points outthat these properties are difficult to obtain directlyfrom corpora.The ability to determine l xical aspect, on a largescale and in the sentential context, therefore yieldsan important source of constraints for corpus anal-ysis and psycholinguistic experimentation, as wellas for NLP applications uch as machine transla-tion (Dorr et al, 1995b) and foreign language tu-toring (Dorr et al, 1995a; Sams.
1995; Weinberg etal., 1995).
Other researchers have proposed corpus-based approaches to acquiring lexical aspect infor-mation with varying data coverage: Klavans andChodorow (1992) focus on the event-state distinc-tion in verbs and predicates; Light (1996) considersthe aspectual properties of verbs and affixes; andMcKeown and Siegel (1996) describe an algorithmfor classifying sentences according to lexical aspect.properties.
Conversely.
a number of works in thelinguistics literature have proposed lexical semantictemplates for representing the aspectual propertiesof verbs (Dowry, 1979: Hovav and Levin, 1995; Levinand Rappaport Hovav.
To appear), although thesehave not been implemented and tested on a largescale.We show that.
it is possible to represent the lexicalaspect both of verbs alone and in sentential contextsusing Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) represen-tations of verbs in the classes cataloged by Levin(1993).
We show how proper consideration of theseuniversal pieces of verb meaning may be used t.orefine lexical representations and derive a range ofmeanings from combinations ofLCS representations.151A single algorithm may therefore be used to deter-mine lexical aspect classes and features at both ver-bal and sentential levels.
Finally, we illustrate howaccess to lexical aspect facilitates lexical selectionand the interpretation of events in machine transla-tion and foreign language tutoring applications, re-spectively.2 Lex ica l  AspectFollowing Olsen (To appear in 1997), we distinguishbetween lexical and grammatical aspect, roughlythe situation and viewpoint aspect of Smith (1991).Lexical aspect refers to the '0ype of situation denotedby the verb, alone or combined with other sententialconstituents.
Grammatical spect akes these situa-tion types and presents them as impeffective (Johnwas winning the race/loving his job) or perfective(John had won/loved his job).
Verbs are assigned tolexical aspect classes, as in Table i (cf.
(Brinton,1988)\[p. 57\], (Smith, 1991)) based on their behaviorin a variety of syntactic and semantic frames thatfocus on their features.
1A major source of the difficulty in assigning lex-ical aspect features to verbs is the ability of verbsto appear in sentences denoting situations of multi-ple aspectual types.
Such cases arise, e.g., in thecontext of foreign language tutoring (Dorr et al,1995b; Sams, 1995; Weinberg et al, 1995), wherea a 'bounded' interpretation for an atelic verb, e.g.,march, may be introduced by a path PP to the bridgeor across the field or by a NP the length of the field:(1) The soldier marched to the bridge.The soldier marched across the field.The soldier marched the length of the field.Some have proposed, in fact, that aspec-tual classes are gradient categories (Klavans andChodorow, 1992), or that aspect should be evaluatedonly at the clausal or sentential level (asp.
(Verkuyl,1993); see (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992) for NLPapplications).Olsen (To appear in 1997) showed that, althoughsentential and pragmatic ontext influence aspectualinterpretation, input to the context is constrained inlarge part by verbs" aspectual information.
In par-titular, she showed that the positively marked fea-tures did not vary: \[+telic\] verbs such as win werealways bounded, for exainple, In contrast, the neg-atively marked features could be changed by othersentence constituents or pragmatic ontext: \[-telic\]verbs like march could therefore be made \[+telic\].Similarly, stative verbs appeared with event inter-pretations, and punctiliar events as durative.
Olsen1Two additional categories are identified by Olsen (Toappear in 1997): Semelfactives (cough, tap) and Stage-level states (be pregnant).
Since they are not assignedtemplates by either Dowty (1979) or Levin and Rappa-port Hovav (To appear), we do not discuss them in thispaper.therefore proposed that aspectual interpretation bederived through monotonic omposition of markedprivative features \[+/1~ dynamic\], \[+/0 durative\] and\[+/0 relic\], as shown in Table 2 (Olsen, To appearin 1997, pp.
32-33).With privative features, other sentential con-stituents can add to features provided by the verbbut not remove them.
On this analysis, the activityfeatures of march (\[+durative, +dynamic\]) propa-gate to the sentences in (1).
with \[+telic\] added bythe NP or PP, yielding an accomplishment i terpre-tation.
The feature specification of this composition-ally derived accomplishment is therefore identical tothat of a sentence containing a relic accomplishmentverb, such as produce in (2).
(2) The commander produced the campaign plan.Dowry (1979) explored the possibility that as-pectual features in fact constrained possible unitsof meaning and ways in which they combine.
Inthis spirit, Levin and Rappaport Hovav (To appear)demonstrate that limiting composition to aspectu-ally described structures is an important part of anaccount of how verbal meanings are built up, andwhat semantic and syntactic ombinations are pos-sible.We draw upon these insights in revising our LCSlexicon in order to encode the aspectual features ofverbs.
In the next section we describe the LCS rep-resentation used in a database of 9000 verbs in 191major classes, We then describe the relationship ofaspectual features to this representation a d demon-strata that it is possible to determine aspectual fea-tures from LCS structures, with minimal modifica-tion.
We demonstrate composition of the LCS andcorresponding aspectual structures, by using exam-pies from NLP applications that employ the LCSdatabase.3 Lex ica l  Conceptua l  S t ruc turesWe adopt the hypothesis explored in Dorr and Olsen(1996) (cf.
(Tenny.
t994)), that lexical aspect fea-tures are abstractions over other aspects of verb se-mantics, such as those reflected ill the verb classes inLevin (1993).
Specifically we show that a privativemodel of aspect provides an appropriate diagnosticfor revising \[exical representations: aspectual inter-pretations that arise only in the presence of otherconstituents may be removed from the lexicon andderived compositionally.
Our modified LCS lexicontheu allows aspect features to be determined algo-rithmically both from the verbal lexicon and fromcomposed structures built from verbs and other sen-tence constituents, using uniform processes and rep-resentations.This project on representing aspectual struc-ture builds on previous work, in which verbs weregrouped automatically into Levin's semantic lasses152Dynamic Durative Examplesknow.

The assignment of as-pectual features to the classes in Levin was done byhand inspection of the semantic effect of the alter-nations described in Part I of Levin (Olsen, 1996),with automatic oindexing to the verb classes (see(Dorr and Olsen, 1996)).
Although a number ofLevin's verb classes were aspectually uniform, manyrequired subdivisions by aspectual class; most ofthese divided atelic "manner" verbs from telic "re-sult" verbs, a fundamental linguistic distinction (cf.
(Levin and Rappaport Hovav, To appear) and refer-ences therein).
Examples are discussed below.Following Grimshaw (1993) Pinker (1989) andothers, we distinguish between semantic struc-ture and semantic content.
Semantic structure isbuilt up from linguistically relevant and univer-sally accessible elements of verb meaning.
Bor-rowing from Jackendoff (1990), we assume seman-tic structure to conform to wellformedness con-ditions based on Event and State types, furtherspecialized into primitives such as GO, STAY,BE, GO-EXT, and ORIENT.
We use Jackend-off's notion of field, which carries Loc(ational) se-mantic primitives into non-spatial domains suchas Poss(essional), Temp(oral), Ident(ificational).Circ(umstantial), and Exist(ential).
We adopt anew primitive, ACT, to characterize certain activi-ties (such as march) which are not adequately distin-guished from other event types by Jackendoff's GOprimitive.-" Finally, we add a manner component, odistinguish among verbs in a class, such the motionverbs run, walk, and march.
Consider march, one2Jackendoff (1990) augments the thematic tier ofJackendoff (1983) with an action tier, which serves tocharacterize activities using additional machinery.
Wechoose to simplify this characterization by using theACT primitive rather than introducing yet another levelof representation.of Levin's Ran kerbs (51.3.2): 3we assign it the tem-plate in (3)(i), with the corresponding Lisp formatshown in (3)(ii):(3) (i) \[z .... ACTLoc(\[xhi,g * 1\],\[M .. .
.
.

.
. )
with a (thing 1) argument.
Seman-tic content is represented by a constant in a se-mantic structure position, indicating the linguisti-cally inert and non-universal spects of verb mean-ing (cf.
(Grimshaw, 1993; Pinker, 1989; Levin andRappaport Hovav, To appear)), the manner com-ponent by march in this case.
The numbers in thelexical entry are codes that map between LCS po-sitions and their corresponding thematic roles (e.g.,1 = agent).
The * marker indicates a variable po-sition (i.e., a non-constant) hat is potentially filledthrough composition with other constituents.In (3), (thing 1) is the only argument.
However.other arguments may be instantiated composition-ally by the end-NLP application, as in (4) below.for the sentence The soldier marched to the bridge:(4) (i) \[E ....

-ed  9))The Lexical Semantic Templates (LSTs) of Levinand Rappaport-Hovav (To appear) and the decom-positions of Dowry (1979) also capture aspectual dis-tinctions, but are not articulated enough to captureother distinctions among verbs required by a large-scale application.Since the verb classes (state, activity, etc.)
are ab-stractions over feature combinations, we now discusseach feature in turn.4.1 Dynamic i tyThe feature \[+dynamic\] encodes the distinction be-tween events (\[+dynamic\]) and states (\[0dynamic\]).Arguably "the most salient distinction" in an aspecttaxonomy (Dahh 1985, p. 28), in the LCS dynamic-ity is encoded at the topmost level.
Events are char-acterized by go, act,  stay, cause, or le t ,  whereasStates are characterized by go-ext  or be, as illus-trated in (6).

Situ-ations that may be punctiliar (achievements) are un-specified for durativity ((O\[sen, To appear in 1997)following (Smith, 1991), inter alia).
In the LCS, du-rativity may be identified by the presence of act,be, go-ext ,  cause, and le t  primitives, as in (7):these are lacking in the achievement template, shownin (8).

Atelic verbs lack an inherent end, though.as (1) shows, they may appear in telic sentences withother sentence constituents.
In the LCS, \[+telic\]verbs contain a Path of a particular type or a con-stant (!!)
in the right-most leaf-node argument.Some examples are shown below:154(9) (i) l eave( .

The(a)telic representations are especially in keepingwith the privative feature characterization Olsen(1994; To appear in 1997): telic verb classes are ho-mogeneously represented: the LCS has a path of aparticular type, i.e., a "reference object" at an endstate.

constituent.Modification of the lexicon to conform to aspec-tual requirements took 3 person-weeks, requiring1370 decision tasks at 4 minutes each: three passesthrough each of the 390 subclasses to compare theLCS structure with the templates for each feature(substantially complete) and one pass to change200 LCS structures to conform with the templates.
(Fewer than ten classes need to be changed for dura-tivity or dynamicity, and approximately 200 of the390 subclasses for telicity.)
With the changes wecan automatically assign aspect to some 9000 verbsin existing classes.
Furthermore.
since 6000 of theverbs were classified by automatic means, new verbswould receive aspectual assignments automaticallyas a result of the classification algorithm.We are aware of no attempt in the literature todetermine aspectual information on a similar scale,in part, we suspect, because of the difficulty ofassigning features to verbs since they appear insentences denoting situations of multiple aspectualtypes.
Based on our experience handcoding smallsets of verbs, we estimate generating aspectual fea-tures for 9000 entries would require 3.5 person-months (four minutes per entry), with 1 person-month for proofing and consistency checking, givenunclassified verbs, organized, say, alphabetically.6 Aspectua l  Feature  Determinat ionfo r  Composed LCS 'sModifications described above reveal similarities be-tween verbs that carry a lexical aspect, feature aspart of their lexical entry and sentences that havefeatures as a result of LCS composition.
Conse-quently, the algorithm that we developed for ver-ifying aspectual conformance of the LCS databaseis also directly applicable to aspectual feature de-termination i  LCSs that have been composed fromverbs and other relevant sentence constituents.
LCScomposition is a fundamental operation in two appli-cations for which the LCS serves as an interlingua:machine translation (Dorr et al.
1993) and foreignlanguage tutoring (Dorr et al, 1995b: Sams.
I993:Weinberg et al, 1995).
Aspectual feature determina-tion applies to the composed LCS by first, assigningunspecified feature values--atelic \[@T\], non-durative\[@R\], and stative \[@D\]--and then monotonically set-ting these to positive values according to the pres-ence of certain const i tuents .The formal specification of the aspectual featuredetermination algorithm is shown in Figure 1.
Thefirst step initializes all aspectual values to be un-specified.
Next the top node is examined for mem-bership in a set of telicity indicators (CAUSE, LET,155Given an LCS representation L:I. Initialize: T(L):=\[0T\], D(L):=\[0R\], R(L):=\[0D\]2.
If Top node of L E {CAUSE, LET, GO}Then T(L):=\[+T\]If Top node of L E {CAUSE, LET}Then D(L):=\[+D\], R(L):=t+R\]If Top node of L 6 {GO}Then D(L}:=\[+D\]3.
If Top node of L E {ACT, BE.
STAY}Then If Internal node ofL E {TO, TOWARD, FORTemp}Then T(L):=\[+T\]If Top node of L 6 {BE, STAY}Then R(L):=\[+R\]If Top node of L E {ACT}Then set D(L):=\[+D\], R(L):=\[+R\]4.
Return T(L), D(L), R(L).Figure 1: Algorithm for Aspectual Feature Determi-nationGO); if there is a match, the LCS is assumed to be\[+T\].
In this case, the top node is further checked formembership in sets that indicate dynamicity \[+D\]and durativity \[+R\].
Then the top node is exam-ined for membership in a set of atelicity indicators(ACT, BE, STAY); if there is a match, the LCS isfurther examined for inclusion of a telicizing com-ponent, i.e., TO, TOWARD, FORT?~p.
The LCSis assumed to be \[@T\] unless one of these telicizingcomponents i  present.
In either case, the top nodeis further checked for membership in sets that indi-cate dynamicity \[+D\] and durativity \[+R\].
Finally,the results of telicity, dynamicity, and durativity as-signments are returned.The advantage of using this same algorithm fordetermination of both verbal and sentential aspectis that it is possible to use the same mechanism toperform two independent tasks: (1) Determine in-herent aspectual features associated with a lexicalitem; (2) Derive non-inherent aspectual features as-sociated with combinations of lexical items.Note, for example, that adding the path l0 thebridge to the \[@relic\] verb entry in (3) establishesa \[+relic\] value for the sentence as a whole, an in-terpretation available by the same algorithm thatidentifies verbs as telic in the LCS lexicon:(14) (i) \[Otelic\]:(act lee (* thing 1) (by march 26))(ii) \[+telic\]:(cause(act loc (soldier) (by march))(to loc (soldier)(at loc (soldier) (bridge))))In our applications, access to both verbal and sen-tential lexical aspect features facilitates the task oflexieal choice in machine translation and interpreta-tion of students' answers in foreign language tutor-ing.
For example, our machine translation systemselects appropriate translations based on the match-ing of telicity values for the output sentence, whetheror not the verbs in the language match in telicity.The English atelic manner verb march and the telicPP across the field from (1) is best translated intoSpanish as the telic verb cruzar with the mannermarchando as an adjunct.
:(15) (i) E: Tile soldier marched across the field.S: El soldado cruz6 el campo marchando.
(ii) (cause(act loc (soldier) (by march))(to loc (soldier)(across loc (soldier) (field))))Similarly, in changing the Weekend Verbs (i.e..December, holiday, summer, weekend, etc.)
tem-plate to telic, we make use of the measure phrase( for  terap .. ,) which was previously available.though not employed, as a mechanism in ourdatabase.
Thus, we now have a lexicalized exam-pie of 'doing something for a certain time' thathas a representation corresponding to the canonicaltelic frame V for  an hour phrase, as in The soldiermarched for an hour:(16) (act loc (soldier) (by march)(for temp (*head*) (hour)))This same telicizing constituent--which is compo-sitionally derived in the crawl construction--is en-coded directly in the lexical entry for a verb such asDecember:(17) (stay loc(* thing 2)((* \[at\] 5) loc (thing 2) (thing 6))(for temp (*head*) (december 31)))This lexical entry is composed with other argu-ments to produce the LCS for .John Decembered atthe new cabin:(18) (stay loc (john)(at loc (john) (cabin (new)))(for temp (ahead*) (december)))This same LCS would serve as the underlyingrepresentation for the equivalent Spanish sentence.which uses an atelic verb estar 4 in colnbination witha telnporal adjunct durance el m.es de Diciembre:John estuvo en la cabafia nueva durance el mes deDiciembre (literally, John was in lhe new cabin dur-ing lhe month of December).The monotonic composition permitted by theLCS templates i slightly different han that perlnit-ted by the privative feature model of aspect (Olsen.1994; Olsen, To appear in 1997).
For example, in tiwLCS states may be composed into an achievement oraccomplishment structure, because states are part4Since estar may be used with both relic {'estar alto)and atelic (estar contento) readings, we analyze it asatelic to permit appropriate composition.156of the substructure of these classes (cf.
templatesin (6)).
They may not, however, appear as activi-ties.
The privative model in Table 2 allows states tobecome activities and accomplishments, by adding\[+dynamic\] and \[+telic\] features, but they may notbecome achievements, since removal of the \[+dura-tive\] feature would be required.
The nature of thealternations between states and events is a subjectfor future research.7 ConclusionThe privative feature model, on which our LCS com-position draws, allows us to represent verbal andsentential lexical aspect as monotonic ompositionof the same type, and to identify the contributionof both verbs and other elements.
The lexical as-pect of verbs and sentences may be therefore deter-mined from the corresponding LCS representations,as in the examples provided from machine transla-tion and foreign language tutoring applications.
Weare aware of no attempt in the literature to representand access aspect on a similar scale, in part, we sus-pect, because of the difficulty of identifying the as-pectual contribution of the verbs and sentences giventhe multiple aspectual types in which verbs appear.An important corollary to this investigation isthat it is possible to refine the lexicon, because vari-able meaning may, in many cases, be attributed tolexical aspect variation predictable by compositionrules.
In addition, factoring out the structural re-quirements of specific lexical items from the pre-dictable variation that may be described by com-position provides information on the aspectual ef-fect of verbal modifiers and complements.
We aretherefore able to describe not only the lexical aspectat the sentential level, but also the set of aspectualvariations available to a given verb type.Re ferencesAndroutsoponlos, Ioannis.
