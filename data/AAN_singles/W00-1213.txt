An information structureconsists of two components: HowNetdefinitions and dependency relations.
Itis the unit of representation of themeaning of texts.
This work is part of amulti-sentential approach to Chinesetext understanding.
An overview ofHowNet and information structure aredescribed in this paper.1 IntroductionCorpora are essential resources to any researchin language ngineering.
For Chinese, efforts inbuilding large corpora started in the 90s.
Forinstance, the PH corpus of 4 million Chinesecharacters with word boundary information wasreleased in 1993 (Guo, 1993).
The first versionof the Sinica corpus of two millions wordsmarked with word boundaries and parts-of-speech was released in 1995 (CKIP, 1995).
In1996, a small corpus of 5266 distinct words(inclusive of punctuation marks) with a totaloccurrence frequency of 51870 was released (Yuet al, 1996).
This corpus was derived from theSingapore Primary School Chinese LanguageTextbooks.
It contained information on wordboundaries, parts-of-speech and also syntacticstructures.
In 2000, two additional bracketedcorpora have just been announced.
The first one,the Chinese Penn Treebank, includes 100-thousand words (Xia et al, 2000).
The secondone, the Sinica Treebank, which is derived fromthe Sinica corpus, contains 38,725 sentenceswith 1000 of them released to the public 1 (CKIP,2000).The historical development of Chinese corpusconstruction has shown a consensus inincorporating more powerful linguisticstructures into corpora.
As noted by Marcus(1997), the more powerful inguistic structureswill help in improving the accuracy of parsing.This is especially true to isolating language suchas Chinese.
However, there is very little work onannotating corpora with semantic information.To the best of our knowledge, there is only onereport of this kind.
The work by Lua 2 annotated340,000 words with semantic lass informationas defined in a thesaurus of synonyms (Mei,1983).
With the release of HowNet 3, a bilingualgeneral knowledge base, Gan and Tham (1999)reported the first corpus of 30,000 words thatwas annotated with the general knowledgestructure defined in HowNet.
This paperreported an extension of the work in &an andTham (1999) on the annotation of informationstructures in Chinese texts.
In Section 2, anoverview of HowNet is provided.
Informationstructure and an illustration will be given inSection 3.2 An Overview of HowNetHowNet is a bilingual general knowledge-basedescribing relations between concepts andrelations between the attributes of concepts.
Thelatest version covers over 65,000 concepts in1http://godel.iis.sinica.edu.tw/CKIP/treesl000.htmz http://www.cslp.com.nus.edu/sg/cslp/3 http://www.HowNet.com (Dong Zhendong, DongQiang; HowNet)85Chinese and close to 75,000 English equivalents.The relations include hyponymy, synonymy,antonymy, meronymy, attribute-host, material-product, converse, dynamic role and conceptcooccurrence.
The philosophy behind the designof HowNet is ' i ts ontological view that allphysical and non-physical matters undergo acontinual process of motion and change in aspecific space and time.
The motion and changeare usually reflected by a change in state that inturn, is manifested by a change in value of someattributes.
The top-most level of classification iHowNet thus includes: entity, event, attributeand attribute value.
It is important o point outthat the classification is derived in a bottom-upmanner.
First, a set of sememes, the most basicset of semantic units that are non-decomposable,is extracted from about 6,000 Chinese characters.This is feasible because ach Chinese characteris monosyllabic and they are meaning-bearing.Similar sememes are grouped.
The coverage ofthe set of sememes i tested against polysyllabicconcepts to identify additional sememes.Eventually, a total of over 1,400 sememes arefound and they are organized hierarchically.This is a closed set from which all concepts aredefined.
The bottom-up approach takesadvantage of the fact that all concepts, eithercurrent or new, can be expressed using acombination of one or more existing Chinesecharacters.
It is yet to f'md a new concept hathas to resort to the creation of a new Chinesecharacter.
Therefore, by deriving the set ofsememes in a bottom-up fashion, it is believedthat the set of sememes is stable and robustenough to describe all kinds of concepts,whether current or new.
The fact that HowNethas verified this thesis over 65,000 concepts is agood proof of its robustness.2.1 Types of RelationThe definition of a concept in HowNet expressesone or more of the following relations.2.1.1 Dynamic RoleThere are a total of 71 dynamic roles defined inHowNet.
Dynamic role resembles case role incase grammar (Fillmore, 1968).
However, itdiffers from case role in that it is concerned withall probable actants of an event and the rolesthey play in the event.
The issue of whetherthese actants can be realized grammatically isnot its concern.
For example,Concept(l): IJ~g~ (be a vegetarian forreligious reasons)DEF=eatlI~, pat ient=vegetablel~,religionl~J~At the syntactic level, "1~"  is an intransitiveverb.
According to case grammar, it has onlyone case role: agent.
However, for this word, thepatient is self-contained in its constituent (i.e.
"~"  ).
HowNet specifies this explicitly andindicates the category ('vegetable'4) ofprototypical concepts which fills up this role.Another distinguishing feature of dynamic roleis its use in defining concepts of 'entity" class.Concept(2): ~\[!~ (writing brush)DEF=Penlnkl~l~, *writel~Through the use of the "*" pointer, the abovedefinition states that the concept being defined(~!~)  is the instrument of the event type"write'.HowNet alo uses dynamic role to specify theattributes that a concept contains.
For example,Concept(3): ~ : ~  (arise suddenly)DEF=happenl~Z~ :, manner=suddenlyThe definition of concept (3) specifies that themanner of the event is 'sudden'.2.L2 Hyponymy RelationThe 'event' and 'entity' classes in HowNet areorganized in a hierarchical manner.
The parentclass is a hypernym of its children classes.Details of the organization are available from theHowNet site and are therefore omitted here.2.1.3 Meronymy RelationMeronymy relation is expressed through the4 We use single-quote and italic to mark sememesin HowNet.86pointer "%" .
For example,Concept (4): ~ .
~  (CPU)DEF=par t l~ ,  %computerl~J~, heartl,~,The class of the-concept " t~5~:~"  is'part'.
It is a part of the class 'computer'.
Thefunction of the part " t : l~S I~"  is the'heart' of the whole 'computer'.2.1.4 Material.Product RelationMaterial-product relation is expressed throughthe pointer "?"
.
For example,Concept (5): ~ ,~ (knitting wool)DEF=matefialltf~t, ?c lo th ing l~"~,~"  belongs to the class 'material'.
It is amaterial for the product 'clothing'.2.1.5 Attribute-Host RelationAttribute-host relation is expressed by thepointer "&" .
For example,Concept (6): ~--~ (face)DEF=attributelJ~, reputat ion l~,&humanl),., &organizationl~\]~,~"~:-~:" is an attribute; in particular, it is aboutthe attribute 'reputation'.
The hosts could be'human' as well as 'organization'.2.1.6 Concept Co-occurrence RelationSome concept typically co-occurs with certainconcept.
For example,Concept (7): ~ : ~  (lawless person)DEF=humanl)~., fiercely, efimel~l~,#policel~, undesiredl~The typical context where the concept "~-~~t~"  is used involves the concept 'police'.This type of relation is expressed by the pointer3 Information StructuresDong (2000) uses the example "~_~l~: .~\ [ \ ]  " (Narcotic drugs smuggling group) toillustrate what information structure is.Describing the structure of this phrase at thesyntactic level, such as the analysis of PennTreebank (Xue, 1999: 72-77), only reveals that itis a noun phrase with the head of "~.~\[\]"modified by a relative clause "~_~.h"which involves operator movement.
At thesemantic level of description, we would indicatethat "~\ [ \ ] "  (group) is the agent of the event"~_~.L" (smuggle) and "~"  (Narcoticdrugs) is the pat/ent of "~_~" (smuggle).The informaton structure of this exampleconsists of two parts, the dependency relationsand the HowNet definitions.
The descriptionsare as follows:Dependency ~ \[patient\] <--:~_~--\[agent\] ~\ [ \ ]relations:Definitions: ~:  medicinel~:jqe~J, ?addictivel~~.L :  transportl~l_I~, manner=secretly, crimel~l~~\[\]: communityl\[\]~In this example, the descriptions specify that a'community" is an agent involved in a'transport' event transporting the patient"medicine'.
Furthermore, the 'transport" event isa 'crime' and the manner is 'secret'.
The'medicine' is a material of 'addictive' products.The arrow between two concepts is adependency onnection with the concept pointedto by the arrow denoting the dependent and theconcept at the other end as the governor.
Thename of the dependency relation is enclosed in asquare bracket and it could appear at either thedependent orthe governor side.Currently, over 60 types of information structurehave been defined.
The pattern of informationstructure is specified in the following format:(sememe) \[DRel\] ~ \[DRel\] (sememe), whereDRel means the name of a dependency relation.For the dependency relation to apply, thegovernor and the dependent must satisfy therequirement of the sememes.
Table 1 shows a87subset of the information structures.
Informationstructures are derived in a bottom-up fashionfrom analysing the mechanisms used in thecomposition of words.
This approach is based onthe insight that mechanisms used in wordformation are also applicable to phrase andsentence construction i Chinese.
For example,the type "(l l  ltime)levent) " applies to the formation of thefollowing units at various levels of linguisticstructure:wordlevel:phraselevel:sentencelevel:"ZF:.~--~I~" (afternoon nap)"~\ ] '~- '~W" (summer study)" :~  ~ <- ~ ~ ~ ~"  (long-timeshortage of commodities)"1999~ 12 ~ 9 \[\] ~ \ ]  \ [ \ ]  <-'-~ ~3~~"  (leaking occurs on Thursday,December 9, 1999)In the process of annotating the corpus, thecoverage of information structure types at thephrase and sentence levels was evaluated andmissing types are added.
The new types arisemainly due to function words.
For example, thetype "(modalityl ~ ~)  \[modalityl ~ ~ \] <--(~'f~:levent)" is due to the use of functionwords such as "~j~," (must) and "~-~"(must).
These are words expressing the attitudeof the speaker of an utterance towards an event.3.1 An exampleWe annotated a subset of the Sinica corpus(version 3.0) of 30,000 words with informationstructures.
The corpus includes 103 newspapertexts covering the crime domain.
The annotationhas been completed and is currently underverification.
We expect to release the corpus andthe annotation guideline at the end of this year.An example of our annotation is shown belowand its information structures are shown inFigure 1 at the end of this paper.
The differencebetween this work and the work reported in Ganand Tham (1999) lies in the addition of thedependency relations into the annotation.
(1) "~-~ ~ ~f~ ~-~-~jTainan county Xinhua police branchcriminal group junior captainLin Wenzheng yesterday afternoonraise gun suicide after,"After Lin Wenzbeng, a junior captainwith the Criminal Investigation Depathuentof the Xinhua police branch of Tainancounty, committed suicide by shootinghimself yesterday afternoon,"The hierarchical structure in Figure 1 is anotherway to represent the relation between governorand dependent, as illustrated in Figure 2.
C1immediately dominates C2, indicating that C1 isthe governor and C2 the dependent.
The relationbetween them is either R1 or R2.
R1 is locatedat the same level as C 1 and R2 is located at thesame level as C2.
These two possibilities couldalso be represented linearly as shown in (2).Conceptcl RelationR2Rl Concept\[c2Figure 2: Relations between concepts(2) Cl \[RI\] ---~ JR2\[ C2R2 between the two concepts C1 and C2 shouldbe read as "C2 is the R2 of CI" .
For example,"T~=" (afternoon) is the .//me of "~"(raise).

As an English and Chinesebilingual eornmon-sense knowledge system,HowNet can contribute much to better textunderstanding and machine translation (Dong1999).4 ConclusionThe work reported here constitutes part of ourefforts to develop a new strategy for Chinesetext understanding.
The strategy was proposedby Dong (1999).
It starts with tagging eachconcept with the most probable HowNetdef'mitions.
The second step is to determine theinformation structures as described in this paper.The last step is to recover the implicitinformation structures from the surfaceinformation structures based on two additionalknowledge sources: (i) relations between theevent ypes as defined in HowNet; and (ii) rulesgoverning the interplay of dynamic rolesbetween event ypes.
For example, the "suicide"event in example (1) does not mention its agentdirectly.
The means of committing 'suicide' by'firing' is also implicit.
The recovery of thisinformation will be the main issues to beresolved at the final stage.
In parallel with ourannotation effort, we are also working ondeveloping automatic algorithms for thedisambiguation of HowNet definitions and theidentification of information structures.
Thecreation of the two additional knowledge baseswill be our future plan.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Hong KongResearch Grant Council.
