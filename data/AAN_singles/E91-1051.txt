IntroductionRecent work in LFG uses the notion ofprojection to refer to linguistically relevant map-pings or convspondences between levels,whether these mappings are direct or involvefunction composition (I-lalvorsen & Kaplan(1988), Kaplan (1987), Kaplan et al(1989)).Mapping functions uch as V (from c to f struc-ture) and o (from c to semantic structure) arefamiliar from the LFO literhture.
Kaplan et al(1989) extend this approach to Machine Transla-tion by defining two translation functions "~(between f-structures) and "~' (between semanticstructures).
By means of these functions, onecan 'co-describe' lements of source and targetf-structures and s-structures respectively.Achieving translation can be thought of in termsof specifying and resolving a set of constraintson target structures, constraints which areexpressed by means of the "~ and "c' functions.The formalism permits a wide variety ofsourco-target correspondences to be expressed: Tand V can be composed, as can -c' and o. Theapproach allows for equations pecifying trans-lations to be added to lexical entries and (sourcelanguage) c-structure rules.
For example:(1) (~ (?
SUB.0) = ((~ 1) SUBJ)composes "~ and ap, equating the ~ of the SUBJf-structure with the SUBJ attribute of the "c ofthe mother's f-structure.
Thus (1) says that thetranslation of the value of the SUBJ slot in asource f-structure fills the SUBJ slot in the f-structure which is the translation of that sourcef-structure.
What results is an interesting, andapparently extremely attractive approach to MT,which finds echoes in a good deal of recentwork in MT and Computational Linguistics gen-erally (van Noord et al(1990), Zajac (1990)).Among the apparent advantages are:(i) that it avoids the problems that arise intraditional stratificational transfer systemswhere a variety of (often incompatible)kinds of information must be expressed ina single structure.
(ii) that, because it uses the formal apparatusof LFG, it is at least compatible with alarge body of well worked out linguisticanalyses.Perhaps most important, however, theexamples that Kaplan et algive suggest that thenotation is both natural and expressive: natural,in the sense that adequate -c relations can bestated on the basis of reasonable intuitive andwell-motivated linguistic analyses; expressive, inthe sense that it is powerful enough to describesome difficult translation problems in a straight-forward way.In this paper we show that the notation isnot as natural and expressive as it at first seems.We first show that the most natural analysis pro-posed in Kaplan et al(1989) cannot in factcover the range of data for the translationalphenomenon i question.
These eases are impor-tant because these constructions represent a per-vasive structural difference between languagesWhich one wants to be able to deal with in anatural way.
We then go on to discuss alterna-tives which depart from or extend the formalism- 293 -proposed in Kaplan et al(1989) in variousrespects, pointing out some directions for furtherresearch.Section 1The discussion here concerns the transla-tional data of head-switching or splitting/fusingdiscussed in Kaplan et al(1989) as cases ofdifferences of embedding:(2a) John just arrived.Jean vient d'arriver.
(b) Jan zwemt graag/toevallig.John likes to/happens to swim.
(c) I think that John just arrived.Je pense que Jean vient d'arriver.
(d) Ik denk dat Jan graag zwemt.I think that John likes to swim.
(e) Ich glaube dass Peter gem schwimmt.I believe that Peter likes to swim.Kaplan et al(1989) sketch two alternativeapproaches to head-switching.
The first assumesthat the adverb is essentially an f-structure headsubeategorising for a sentential ARG.
This hasthe effect of making the source and target f-structures rather similar to each other but facesa number of serious problems.
Firstly, itviolates the LFG assumption that the f-structureof the highest c-structure node contains the f-structures of all other nodes.
Secondly, whilesuch an analysis might well be correct forsemantic structure, it cannot be justified onmonolingual grounds as a surface syntacticfeature structure (an f-structure).
For example,it is the verb, not the adverb, which is the syn-tactic head of the construction, carrying tenseand participating in agreement phenomena.This proposal therefore lacks monolingualmotivation and thus is not attractive as anapproach to translation.
Thirdly, the approachcannot be extended to the case discussed here.In this paper we focus on the alternativeproposal, in which head-switching (or alterna-tively, splitting) is a x operation.
1 Adverbs "aretaken to be f-structure SADJs.
The z annotationto ADVP states that the x of the mother f-structure is the XCOMP of the "~ of the SADJI Notice that a third possibility, not discussed in Ka-plan el al (1989), involving a flat f-structure but treatingthe adverb as a semantic head at s-structure, simplymeans  that the mapping problem we describe below ar-ises in the monolinsual mapping between f-structureand s-structure.slot (Kaplan et als fig.
26): 2(3)S ~ NP ADVP VP(t SUB?3 = ~ (t SADJ)=~(~ (t SADr) XCOMP) = (~ t)This has the effect of subordinating the transla-tion of the f-structure which contains the SADJto the translation of the SADJ itself.
The lexicalentries themselves contribute further z equations(following Kaplan et als fig.
21):(4)arrive: V (t PRED) = arrive<SUBJ>((x t) PRED FN) = arriver(-c (t SUBJ)) = ((~ 1) SUBJ)just: ADV(~ PRED) = just(('~ t) PRED Ft,0 = venirjohn: N(~ PILED) = john((x t) PRED FN) = jeanThis is unproblernatic for examples such as(2a, b).

It does not give acorrect ranslation of the source string.In this section we have shown that theproposal as outlined in Kaplan et al(1989) doesnot produce an adequate analysis of these cases,The problem, which is not at first apparent,arises from the combination of the regular andirregular equations from the emphasised lines.Note that there is no problem stating thiscorrespondence in the French -> English direc-tion (see below).Section 2.0.In this section we will briefly consider anumber of alternatives.
3 To facilitate discussion,it is worth noting that the proposal in Kaplan etal (1989) involves basically three elements:(11a) a set of (regular) equations constrainingboth source and target:(~ (t SUB~) = ((~ t) sum)( l lb) a set of (regular) equations assigning tar-get PRED values:((~ t) PRED ~9 = sere form( l lc )  a (special) equation on ADVP constrain-ing both source and target:((~ (I' SADJ)) XCOMP) = (~ t)The problem noted above arises from thecombination of an equation from (a) withthe equation (c).Section 2.1.The first alternative we consideredinvolves maintaining equations of type (a) (sothat (T (f3) is indeed (('~ fl) COMe)), and thenswitching heads only (rather than whole con-structions).
The basic idea is that the ~ annota-tions to ADVP provide a PRED value for xDand specify that the ?
of the PRED of t3 is thePRED in (~-f3 XCOMP).
To do this, the PREDvalue must be made into a complex feature, and+heavy use is made of "~ equations on the c-structure rules, so that the mapping is essentiallystructurally determined.3 These alternat/ves have been ex#ored by usin 8 atEssex an implementation of PArR due to Bob Car-penter, and at Edinburgh a ve~on of MicroPATR.- 295 -'Intuitively, the approach works by build-ing target constructions without assigning themPRED values directly, then specifying the targetPRED values in such a way that it is possible toswitch the heads for the eases in question..LPIn fact, though this works for cases such as(2c,d,e), it is limited to cases in which it iscorrect o raise all the dependents of a predicateto the same slot in the construction headed bythe translation of the adverb.
It thus fails with(12a) in which races must remain a dependentof the embedded construction, and (12b) inwhich the same is true of Jean:(12a) Peter zwemt gruag wedstrijden.Peter likes to swim races.
(12b) I said that John will probably come.J'ai dit qu'il est probable que Jean viendra.This is of course an immediate consequence ofthe fact that the proposal works by switchingnot constructions but heads..SH Section 2.2.It is clear from the above that any solu-tion must achieve constructional integrity intranslation.
This idea can be achieved in anumber of (slightly different) ways.
In the fol-lowing we exploit the path equation variablesavailable in LFG, which permit one to use avalue assigned elsewhere as an attribute (that is,our proposal here is modelled on the use of (1'(~ PCASE) = ~) in LFG.We alter ( l la) and (l lb) so that the pathsthat they constrain are sensitive to the value ofan attribute (which we call CTYPE):(13)(( "c 1 )` (1  `CTYPE) PRED FN) = sem form(( "c 1') (1` CTYPE) SUBJ) =.0; (1` SUEd))(( x 1`) (1` CTYPE) OBJ) = (~ (1  `OBJ)) aThe value of Cq"YPE is given by the adverbialannotations:(14a)on ADVP:(~t)=(TD(1  `CTYPE) = (~ TYPE)4 Notice that edl dependents of a head must be madosensitive to the value of the CTYPE attribute (to main-lain constructional integrity).
To deal with non-subeategorised constituents such as SADJs (whose xequations are given by c-structure rule) we must anno-late ADVP with: "?
( t  SADJ) = (( x t)  (?
CTYPE)SAm)(14b)on the adverb just:(1  `TYPE = XCOMP)Notice that the "c annotation to ADVP (whichstates that the translation of the containing f-structure is the translation of the f-structureassociated with the ADVP (i.e: the SADJ slot))simply equates the x of two f-structures andavoids the problem which beset the proposal inKaplan et al(1989).
This can be seen from theequation set for (2c) in (15).
Note that whenthere is no adverb, the value of ( t CTYPE)must be ?
(since paths are regular expressions((~ ?)
( 0 GD - ((T t) G~3).
(15)((~ fl) PRED FN) --- penser(~ (n sum)) = ((~ fl) sum)(z (fl COMP)) = ((~: fl) COMP)((, f2) PRED FN) = je(( z f3) XCOMP PRED FN) = arriver(( ~ f3) XCOMP SUm-) = (~ ( f3 SUm))(('c f4) PRED FN) = jean(~ t3) = (~ f5)((x f5) PRED FN) = venirWhat is the cost of this proposal?
Thetranslational correspondences: in all lexicalentries will be sensitive in this way to the valueof the CTYPE feature.
We must guarantee thatwhen a value is not contributed by the typefeature on the adverb, the value of ( 1' CTYPE)is e, either by some priority union operation toinitialise it to e, or by some other conventionwith this effect, or by assuming different ver-sions of the c-structure rules (with VP contribut-ing ( 1`  CTYPE) = E) as appropriate.Variants of this solution which do notexploit the path equation variable apparatus ofLFG are also possible, though at the cost ofmassively increasing the size of the lexicon.For example, lexieal translation correspondencescould be disjunctions as in (16).

Our starting point is theproblematic pair of equations repeated in (17)and the observation that the required targetstructure embeds the XCOMP within theCOMP.
(17)(x (~ COMP)) = ((x I )COMP)-(-~ (~)) = ((~ a)  CoMe)(x 1') = (x (~ SAD J) XCOMP) -(x (f3)) = ((-t fS) XCOMP)The interpretation f the (r (t COMP)) = (('c t)COMP) could be loosened on the source side, asin (18):(18)(-c (t COMa OF)) = ((~ t ) COMe).
(x (r3 oF)) -- ((x n)  ?OMP)which specifies that the translation of some f-structure on a path from the source COMP (e.g.the COMP SADJ) fills the COMP slot in thetranslation.
This avoids the problem in (17).Equally, the interpretation could be loosened onthe target side:(19)(x (t COMP)) = (('t ~) COMP OF) ,,(,t(f3)) : ((-c n) COMP OF)"which says that the translation of the COMPfills some path from the COMP slot in the trans-lation (e.g.
the COMP XCOMP).
This proposalraises a number of interesting questions forfurther esearch about whether functional uncer-tainty can be used here while still guaranteeingsome determinate set of output structures to bevalidated (or not) by the target grammar.Notice however that for the case in hand, theuncertainty equation can be quite specific - allthat is required is the source functional uncer-tainty:('~ (f COMP SAD J)) = (('t t ) COMP)3.
Conclusion.Our starting point in this paper was theobservation that a treatment proposed for casessuch as (2) in Kaplan et al(1989) is unwork-able.
We have then discussed alternativeapproaches available within the general modelassumed by Kaplan et al(1989).
We haveshown that the problem is to achieve simplegeneral statements of the correspondence map-ping which cover exceptional eases withoutspreading the effect of exceptionality hroughoutthe grammar.
The discussion in section 2 raisesintricate technical issues about the formalismitself, but also relates to wider issues concerningthe modularity of the approach to translationproposed in Kaplan et al(1989) as well as thesuitability and expressivity of the formalism,raising serious questions about the feasibility ofa large MT system along these lines.We also noted that these eases areunproblematic in the "fusing" direction, for thenwe do not run into problems with the func-tionality of the x correspondence.
In this direc-tion, the 'special' equations are within the lexi-eal entry for venir:20)(( ?
T) SADJ PRED FN) = just(~ t )  = (~ (t  XCOMP))Substituting variables for clarity, combiningfhese equations with the regular equation fromthe embedding verb (penser) produces no incon-sistency, since the path specifications -all COMPand xf5 can be equated:(21)(~ (n COMP) = ((~ a)  COMe) =(-c 13) = (('~ fl) COMP)(~ 13) = (~ (13 XCOMP)) -(~ 13) = O: (fs))(( "~ 13) SADJ PRED FN) = justThis observation raises interesting questionsconcerning the directionality assumed in Kaplanet al(1989).
R seems that the correct way toview all this is that we have a system ofcorrespondences relating 4 structures (Sourceand Target c and f structures).
For a given setof correspondences and a partially determinedSet of structures, three possibilities exist:?
no solution can be found;- 297 -?
a finite number of solutions can be found;?
an indeterminate and/or infinite number ofsolutions can be found.We might expect herefore that a solutionmay be found even if we state correspondencesin the French -> English direction but supplythe partial determination from the English side(that is, when English is source).
The system fortranslating in either direction would then be apair of monolingual grammars with a set of xequations tated in the "fusing" direction (i.e.
inthe French grammar).
This is currently underinvestigation.Preliminary results suggest that thisapproach will in fact cleanly overcome thespecific problem at hand.
It has proved possibleto translate sentences (2b) and (2d) above fromDutch to English using grammars and lexiconsin which ~ only appears in the English rules andentries.
But this work has in turned raised anumber of fundamental issues, some of whichapply not only to LFG but to any other attemptat theory-based translation:?
Exactly what does the formal definition ofthe 'translates' relation look like, in LFGor any other theory-based approach totranslation??
Can this formal definition actually beimplemented?
Existing approaches togeneration from f/s-structure in LFG aretoo restrictive (Wedekind 1988), and ourcurrent implementation ver-compensates.?
Is the functional nature of correspon-dences appropriate to the z family, orwould a relation be more appropriate?
Ifso, what would the theoretical and practi-cal consequences be??
What is the relation between stricttheory-based 'translation' and translationin the ordinary sense of the word?
Is itnot likely that its applicability will inpractice be limited to closely relatedlanguage pairs??
Is there a substantive difference betweenthe structures and - correspondencesapproach of LFG and the single - struc-tured - sign approach of I-IPSG or UCG?Translation seems a strenuous test.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe thank an anonymous EACL reviewerfor helpful comments and constructive criti-Cisms, and Doug Arnold and Pete Whitelock foruseful discussion.
