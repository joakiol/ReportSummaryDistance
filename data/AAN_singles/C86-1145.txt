PHONOLOGICAL PIVOT PARSINGGrzegorz DogilUnivers i t~t  B ie le fe ldFakult~t fur L ingu is t ikund L i teraturwissenschaftD-4800 B ie le fe ldWest GermanyThere are two basic mysteries about natural lan-guage.
The speed and ease with which i t  is acquired bya ch i ld  and the speed and ease with which i t  is pro-cessed.
S imi la r ly  to language acquis i t ion,  languageprocessing faces a strong input -data-def ic iency pro-blem.
When we speak we a l te r  a great lo t  in the ideal -ized phonological and phonetic representat ions.
We de-lete whole phonemes, we rad ica l ly  change allophones,we sh i f t  stresses, we break up in tonat iona l  patterns,we insert  the pauses at the most unexpected places,etc.
I f  to th is  cr ippled 'phonological s t r ing '  we adda l l  the noise from the surroundings which does nothelp comprehension e i ther ,  i t  is bewildering that  theparser is supposed to recognize anything at a l l .
How-ever, even in the most d i f f i cu l t  circumstances ( for -eign accent, loud environment, being drunk, etc . )
wedo comprehend speech quick ly  and e f f i c ient ly .
Theremust be then some signals in the phonetic s t r ing whichare par t i cu la r ly  easy to grasp and to process.
I ca l lthese signals 'p ivots '  and parsers working with thesesignals I cal l  'p ivot  parsers' .What are then the pivots in the phonetic str ing?I am not proclaiming any heresy by saying that thepivots should correspond to the most audible parts ofthe phonetic s t r ing .
I f  we look at the in tens i ty  t rac-ing of speech we w i l l  notice a fa i r l y  regular sequenceof peaks.
At the lowest prosodic leve l ,  the level  ofthe sy l lab le ,  these peaks correspond to the vowelsforming sy l lab ic  nuclei .
In my view, the parser w i l lor ient  i t se l f  foremostly on these vocal ic  peaks.
Thatis to say, the parser in my model is a 'jumper' whichrecognizes the best audible units of speech - vowelsbui ld ing sy l lab ic  nuclei - and disregards everythingelse.
Such a parser is de f in i te ly  very Fast but i t  isalso very ine f f i c ient .
Having recognized just  a s t r ingof vowels we do not have enough information to f ind aword which contains these vowels.
Or does anyone sub-consciously 'know' which word the st r ing of vowels /.a .a .
i .e .
/ corresponds to?!
The parser needs def i -n i te ly  more information,  but how much more?
This iswhere my hypothesis about ' idea l  prosodic types' comesinto  play.In Dogil: 1985, I argued that at each level  of pro-sodic organizat ion there ex is t  p ro to typ ica l ,  unmarkedstructures which manifest themselves not only in pat-terns of a l l  natural  languages but are also c lear lyv i s ib le  in the areas of external  evidence such as lan-guage acquis i t ion,  language loss, and language change.Here I w i l l  argue that these ' idea l  prosodic types'play an important ro le in language processing.At the lowest prosodic level - the level of thesy l lab le  - such an ideal type is const i tuted by a CVsy l lab le .
That is ,  the proto typ ica l ,  unmarked sy l la -ble consist of a s ingle consonant fol lowed by a vowel.There is p lenty of evidence for  this prototype (cf .Clements & Keyser: 1983, 28f f .
,  Ohala & Kawasaki:1984, 115-119).
For example:- there is no language which would not have CV syl -lables, but there are many languages which have on-ly CV sy l lab les- phonological rules which ob l i te ra te  sy l lab ic  struc-ture usually spare CV sy l lables- CV sy l lab les  are acquired as f i r s t  in the processof language acquis i t ion- CV sy l lab les  are preserved even in the most severeforms of motor aphasia (cf.
Dogil: 1985)- h i s to r i ca l  sy l lab ic  restructur ing rules tend to-wards the creat ion of CV sy l \ ]ab les .A l l  this evidence c lear ly  i l l us t ra tes  the proto-typ ica l  character of t l \ ] is  uni t .
i claim that  th isunit is also essential  For p re - lex ica l  parsing.
Whatthe parser essent ia l l y  does is recognize CV sy l lab lesin the st r ing.
I propose i t  does this in the fo l low-ing way:-- The parser searches for  the f i r s t  in tens i typeak and once i t  has found i t  i t  stops there.
AsI said before these in tens i ty  peaks are cotermi-nous with vowels (most sonorous sound types) form-ing sy l lab ic  nuclei .
The parser goes back in 10 msec.steps making a diphone !
of the vowel and the con-sonant preceding i t .
This gives a diphonic repre-sentat ion of CV sy l lab les .
The di f ference betweenthe diphone scanner in my model and in a l l  othermodels is that my scanner works backwards s tar t ingat the peak of the vowel.- -  The parser recognizes the sy l lab le .
S t r i c t lyspeaking i t  recognizes only the unmarked, proto-typ ica l  CV part of the sy l lab le .
These prototyp-ica l  CV's are stored as diphones in the diphoned ic t ionary .
I f  the sy l lab le  contains other units ,for  example i f  i t  is CCVCC sy l lab le  ( l i ke  in thename 'P lanck')  these other units w i l l  be disre-garded, and only the CV ( / la /  of /p laok/ )  w i l lbe ava i lab le  a f ter  the in i t ia l  parse.- -  Having ident i f ied  the sy l lab le  the parsermakes i ts  f i r s t  hypothesis about the word thatthis sy l lab le  is a part of.-- The parsing strategy is carr ied on by jump-ing to the next in tens i ty  peak, i .e .
the nextvowel.Consider a simple example of a parse by a sy l lab icp ivot  parser of a German sentence "Ich gehe zum Max-P lanck - lns t i tu t "  - I am going to the Max-Planck-Ins t i tu t :(I) \[ ?g gee tsum maks plaok ?institut \]I did some simple speech ed i t ing  which monitors the'Diphones' are defined as transitions from themiddle of one phone to the midpoint of the pre-ceding one.615function of my parser.
From the phonetic st r ing in (1)I cl ipped off  the parts of the onset and the codaswhich according to the pivot parser are not processedon the in i t ia l  parse.
The result ing str ing in (2) wasfu l l y  recognizable.
(2) \[ '?i ge tsu ma \[a ?1 t ;  tu \]Actually i t  strongly reminded of fast/casual Germanspeech.When I cl ipped off  these parts of the str ing whichthe pivot parser considers relevant - i .e .
consonantsimmediately preceding the vowels - the str ing was notrecognizable any more.
Consider the t ranscr ipt ion in(3):(3) \[ i~ ee um aks aqk ins I ut \]Actually, some of my informants claimed that i t  wasnot a sentence of the i r  language.
Needless to say thestr ing was not recognizable when the vowels were ob-l i te rated .
2Given a l l  the grammatical, contextual and back-ground knowledge that we possess when parsing str ings,the sy l lab ic  v ivot parser might be actual ly su f f i -cient for  comprehension.
Even i f  i t  is insu f f i c ientin the form that I have presented i t  so far ,  i t  isfast enough to incorporate a number of repair strate-gies that can make i t  su f f i c ient  for comprehension.
Iw i l l  just  mention some of these possible repair  s t ra t -egies without going into any deta i l .1.
Phonemic Restoration Strategy - recovers soundswhich are adjacent to the CV pivot.
For example, incase the sy l lab le  / la /  in our example sentence didnot contain enough information to recognize the cor-responding name 'Planck',  the consonant /p/  preceding/ la /  and the consonant /~/ fol lowing / la  d would haveto be recovered by this  repair  strategy.
~2.
Pivot parsing at higher prosodic levels - for  in-stance recovering ' ideal  types' at the level of thefoot or the prosodic word.
As I understand i t  thisis exactly what Taft: 1984 has proposed.
Another pos-s ib le  method here is f inding the patterns of intona-t ional  morphemes and pauses and matching these to theI did this speech editing using the SPED softwareon PDP Ii.
I thank Carla Coenders of the MPl forassisting me in speech editing.Warren: 1970, who first argued for the PhonemicRestoration Strategy, replaced the first phoneme/s/ in a word like 'legislature' with a coughingsound of about the same intensity as the speech.He then presented this word to subjects, and askedthem to indicate where in the word the cough oc-curred.
The subjects were unable to accurately lo-cate the cough.
More important, the missing pho-neme was completely 'restored'; that is, it wasnot perceived as missing.
The subjects heard the/s/ in 'legislature', and the cough was heard asbackground noise.
Hence, a listener can generatephonemes (given contextual information) that donot exist in the speech string.
He can do this, Iwould predict, only in these positions that areoutside of the CV pivot.
If we replaced some partof the pivot with noise, the subjects would not beable to restore it - just as it was the case withmy example (3).616dialogue structure~ as was proposed in Gibbon: 1985.3.
Faking advantage of the language spec i f ic  phono-tac t i c  constraints - for  example, the fact that in alanguage long vowels may occur only in open syl lablestakes a great load of f  the parser which has discovereda long vowel?4.
Allophonic f i x ing  of constituent boundaries.
l-hissort of parsing strategy is central in Church's: 1983phonological parser, which I w i l l  have something tosay about later .
Obviously, because allophones are avery much language speci f ic  matter, the allophonicparser is also language speci f ic .5.
Using higher level representational knowledge (mor-pho-syntactic and semantic knowledge) in order to re-pair  the result  of the prosodic pivot parse - for  ex-ample, i f  we parse a word l ike {export} with an in i -t ia l  ( i .e .
'nouny' stress) in a syntact ic posit ion ofa verb, we w i l l  probably not think twice about i tsprosodic 'nouniness' but in terpret  i t  as a verb (cf .Cutler & Cl i f ton:  1984).
I guess we use the s imi larstrategy to recover suff ixes which are in i t ia l l y  notparsed.Most of these parsing strategies presented aboveare language speci f ic ,  and I do not see them as a l te r -natives to my pivot parser but as additions to i t .The pivot parser which orients i t se l f  on the prototyp-ical  l ingu is t i c  units is obviously universal ly appl i -cable.The pivot parser is fast .
I t  is de f in i te ly  fasterthan the f in i te  state parser developed by Church:1983.
Church's parser also divides the str ing ofspeech into the sequence of syl lables (and metrlcalfeet ) .
However, instead of prototypical  pivots i tuses the constraints that the sy l lab le  imposes on thed i s t r ibut ion  of allophones.
I t  is tuned to the analy-sis of these phonetic features which are typica l  ofsy l lab le  in i t ia l  and sy l lab le  f ina l  posit ions.
Churchhas shown that his method greatly reduces the numberof competing sy l lab ic  analyses compatible with a givenutterance.
Nonetheless, some unresolved ambiguity a-bout the correct sy l lab ic  segmentation persists des~pi te the effect  of the phonotactic constraints.
Notethat the sy l lab ic  pivot parser does not give r ise toany ambiguity of this  sort .
The str ings are sy l lab i -f ied to the ' idea l '  CV chunks.Church's parser is slower than the sy l lab ic  pivotparser because i t  has to wait unt i l  i t  reaches thesy l lable f ina l  posit ion~in order to f i x  the boundaryof the recognit ion un i tX  This, in turn, makes theparser very ine f f i c ient  and, actual ly ,  inadequategiven the input-data-def ic iency problem that I dis-cussed at the beginning of this paper.
The sy l lab lef ina l  posit ion that Church's parser c r i t i ca l ly  de-pends upon is the most vulnerable posi t ion for  phono-logical  obscuration processes (cf .
Dressler: 1984).These processes which weaken, ob l i te ra te  or even de-lete sy l lab le  f ina l  allophones are very operative innatural (par t i cu la r ly  fast/casual)  speech.
Thus, i fthese processes apply and the posit ions which Church'sparser depends on are not there any more, the parsew i l l  break down.
I am concluding then that Church'sAll psycholinguistic experiments (cf, Frauenfelder:1985 for an overview) speak against this waitingstrategy.
Actually the words are recognized longbefore (2-3 phonemes before) their final segmentshave been processed.language specif ic  allophonic parser is slower than myuniversal sy l lab ic  pivot parser and that i t  also facesa strong inef f ic iency problem.Similar problems apply to a l l  the phonemic parsers.As an example let  us discuss a parser assumed in thewidespread Cohort Model of word recognit ion.
The par-ser imp l i c i t  in the Cohort Model is a sequential cate-gor ia l ,  correct,  phonemic parser (cf .
Frauenfelder:1985).
I ts purpose is f inding the 'uniqueness point 'for word recognit ion.
Let us assume (af ter  Marslen-Wilson: 1984, 141-142) that the word to be recognizedis "trespass".
Given the phonemic information, we candetermine the point at which "trespass" becomesuniquely dist inguishable.
There are many words thatbegin with / i re / ,  and at least two that share the in i -t ia l  sequence / i res /  ( t res t le ,  tress) .
But immediate-ly fol lowing the /s /  only "trespass" remains.
The dis-crimination point for  this word is therefore at the/p / .
I t  is here, and no later ,  that an optimal systemshould discriminate the word.Now, what is the strategy of the pivot parser torecognize a word l ike "trespass"?
F i rst  i t  w i l l  f indthe intens i ty  peak and recognize i t  as the vowel /e / .Then i t  w i l l  bind the consonant preceding this voweland recognize i t  as / t r / .
I assume that /~r /  is a mo-nosegmental a f f r i cate .
The parser w i l l  recognize thef i r s t  sy l lab le  as / i re /  and make a f i r s t  hypothesis a-bout the word.
The cohort of compatible words w i l l  in-clude a l l  the words in Marslen-Wilson's cohort, plussome more words that have the in i t ia l  sy l lab le  / s i re /(strength, stress, stretch) .
Then the parser w i l l  jumpto the next intensi ty  peak and recognize i t  as thevowel /a / .
I t  w i l l  bind the preceding consonant andrecognize i t  as /p / .
Now i t  possesses two syl lables/~re/ and /pa/ for  the next hypothesis as to word re-cognition.
This is actual ly enough as there is justone word in English containing these two syl lables inthat order - th is  word is "trespass".The whole procedure lasts approximately 400 msec.,and 4 segments have to be recognized unt i l  the'uniqueness point '  has been reached.
Hence, nw parseris possibly not less e f f i c ient  than the sequentialphonemic parser, and i ts  uniqueness recognit ion pointdoes not come later  than predicted by studies connec-ted with the Cohort Model's phonemic parser (cf.
Carl-son, Elenius, Granstrom and Hunnicutt: 1985).Obviously sy l labic  pivot parser:requires a d i f fe r -ent structur ing of the lexicon than the standard pho-nemic structur ing imp l i c i t  in the Cohort Model parser.Let us imagine a lexicon which is organized accordingto the CV sy l lab ic  pivots.
In order to foster ourimagination I w i l l  compare such a lexicon to a ware-house.
Imagine that words are the spare parts thatthe machines (sentences) are made of.
Al l  the spareparts have screws that keep them together.
Imagine nowthat these screws are the prototypical  CV syl lables.Our warehouse ( lexicon) is organized according towhich screws (CV syl lables)  f i t  which spare parts(words).
I f  you need a spare part (a word), but youknow only what type of a screw (CV sy l lab le)  you havein i t  and what type of machine (context and sentenceinformation) i t  might be used in, the warehouse admin-i s t ra t ion  (the parser) w i l l  provide you with the sparepart you have been looking for .
I have been told thatwarehouses organized according to this  pr inc ip le  ac-tua l ly  exist  ( in industry) and that they work muchmore e f f i c ient ly  than the warehouses which l i s t  thedeta i ls  of a l l  of the i r  spare parts.There is, however, one major advantage which myparser has over any phonemic parser.
Phonemic parsersrequire that a l l  decisions on the sensory input arealways made correct ly .
That is,  every single phonemein the str ing must be correct ly recognized.
Given thedeficiency of the input str ing which I kept mention-ing through my paper, tiTis correctness requirement maynever be fu l f i l l ed  (except maybe in a psychol inguist iclab).Even in the most ideal ized and ar t i f i c ia l  labora-tory s i tuat ion the acoustic manifestation of many pho-nemes depends upon the context.
For example, the sec-ond formant of /d /  in the sy l lab le  /d i /  has a r is ingt rans i t ion ,  whereas in /du/ i t  has a fa l l ing  one.
Aparser which takes no account of the vowel in the syl-lable cannot be expected to real ize that a r i s ing  anda fa l l ing  t rans i t ion  are cues for the same phoneme.My parser does not face this sort of problem be:cause the phonological properties i t  is tuned to arethe most sa l ient  ones from the perceptual point ofview (cf .
Marcus: 1981)and are best preserved in pho-netic str ings.I have presented to you an idea of what a fastparser which requires the minimum of phonlogical ly in-variant information might look l ike .
This parser worksin a sequential ly- looping manner and the decisions i tmakes are non-determinist ic.
I t  is universal ly appl i -cable, i t  is faster ,  and i t  seems to be no less e f f i -cient than other phonological parsers that have beenproposed.References:Carlson, R., K. Elenius, B.
