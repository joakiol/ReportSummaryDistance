We c la im that  the  advantage ofthis approach is its reliance upon pragmat icinformation, including discourse content andconversational goals, rather than upon preciserepresentations of the preceding utterance alone.INTRODOCTIONThe fraRmentary utterances that are common incommunication between humans also occur in man-Nachi~e OOmmUlLCcation.
Humans perslat in usingabbreviated statements and queries, even in thepresence o/ explicit and repeated instructions toadhere to syntactically and semantically completesentences (Carbonell, 1983) ?
Thus a robustnatural langua@e interface must handle ellipsis.We have studied one class of ellipticalutterances, Intersentential fragments, in the con-text of an Information-seeklng dialogue.
As notedby Allen(1980), such utterances differ from otherforms of ellipsis in that interpretation oftendepends more heav i ly  upon the speaker's inferredunderlying task-related plan than upon precedingsyntactic forms.
For example, the fcllowlngelliptical fra@ment can only be interpreted withinthe context of the speaker's goal as communicatedin the first utterance:\[EX1 \] aT want to cash this check.Smell bills only .
*Furthermore, intersententiel fragments are of tenemployed to communicate discourse 8oals, such asexpressing doubt, which a syntactically completeform of the same ut terance  may not convey aseffectively.

"Previous research on ellipsis has neglected toaddress the speaker's discourse Eoals in employingthe frasment but reel understanding requires thatthese be identified (Mann, Moore, and Levin, 1977)(Webber, PoZlack, and Hirschberg, 1982).In this paper, we investlgate a framework forinterpreting Intersententlal ellipsis that occursin task-orlented dialogues.
This frameworkincludes:\[1\]\[2\]a context mechanism (Carberry, 1983) thatbuilds the information-seeker, s underlyingplan as the dialogue progresses and differen-tiates be~een local and global contexts.a discourse component that controls theinterpretation of ellipsis based upondiscourse goal expectations ~eaned from thedial o@ue ; this component "understands"ellipsis by identifying the" discourse goalwhich the speaker is pursuing by employingthe elliptical fragment, and by determininghow the frasment should be interpreted rela-tive to that goal.\[3\] an analysis component that suggests possibleassociations o?
an elliptical fragment withaspects of the inferred plan for theinformation-seeker.\[4\] an evaluation component which, 51yen multiplepossible associations o?
an elliptical f rag -ment with aspects of  the information-seeker,sunderlying plan, selects that ansociationmost appropriate to the discourse context andbelieved to be intended by the speaker.INTERPRETATION OF INTERS~qTENTIAL ~LLTPSISAs L t lus t ra ted  by \[EX1\], in tersentent ie leA1ipt icaA fra@ments cannot  be fu l l y  unders tood  inand of  themselves.
Therefore a strate8~ forinterpreting suc~ fra@ments must rely on knowledgeobta ined  f rc l  sources  o ther  than the f ragmentitself.
Three possibilities exist: the syntacticee Ta.~n f r '~  F lowers and Dyer(198~)188form ar precedlug utterances, the seaantlorepresentat ion  of  preceding utterances, and expec-tations gleaned from understanding the precedingdisQourse.The first two strategies are exemplified bythe work oC Carbosoll and Hayes(1983), Hendrlx,Sacerdot?,  and Sloc,~( 1976), Waltz( 1978), andVelschedel and 3ondhelmer( 1982 ).
Several limita-tions exist in these approaches, includiug an ina-bilit 7 to handle utterances that rely upon anassumed communication of  the underlying task anddifficulty in resolving ambigui ty  ="oug multipleinterpretations.
Consider the following twod is lo~e sequences:SPEAE~R: "I want to take a bus.The cost?
"SPEAKER: "I want to purchase a bus.The cost?
"Zf a semantic strategy is employed, the case framerepresentation for "bus" may have a "cost of  bus"and a "cost of  bus ticket" s lo t ;  a~hlgulty arisesregardlug to which slot the elliptical fr~sment"The cost?"
refers.
A l thou~ one might suggestextensions far handling this fra~ent, a semanticstrategy alone does not prov ide an adequate frame~-wurk fo r  Interpreting intersentential ellipsis.The third potential strategy utilizes a modelc~ the information-seeker's inferred tank-relatedplan and discourse ~oals.
The power of  thisapproach is its reliance upon pragmatic informa-tion, including discourse content and converse-t iona~ goals, rather than upon prec ise  representa-tions of the preceding utterances alone.Allen(1980) was the first to re la te  ellipsisprocesslug to the domain-dependent plan underlyinga speaker's utterance.
Allen views the speaker'sutterance as part of a plan which the speaker hasconstructed and is executlug to accomplish hisoverall task-related goals.
To interpret ellipti-cal fragments, Allen first constructs a set ofpossible surface speech act representations forthe elliptical fragment, limited by syntacticclues appearing within the fragment.
The task-related ~oals which the speaker might pursue forma set o1" expectations, and Allen attempts to inferthe speaker's ~al-related plan which resulted inexecution of the observed utterance.
A part ofthis inference process involves determining whichof the partially constructed plans connectingexpectations (goals) and obeerved utterance are'reasonable given the knov led~ and mutual beliefsof  the speaker and hearer.
Allen selects the sur-face speech act which produced the most reasonab lein fe r red  plan as the correct interpretation.Allen notes that the speaker's fragment mustidentif7 the subg~als which the spea~er is pursu-Lug, but claims that  in very restricted dmaains,identifying the speaker's overall ~ from theutterance l s  su f f i c ient  to i dent i fy  the appropr i -a te  response in terms of  the obstacles present  insuch a plan.
For his restricted do~aln involvingtrain arrivals and depar tures ,  Allen's Interprets-tlon strategy vurke well.
In more complexdomains, it Is necessary to identify the particu-lar aspect of the speaker's overall task-relatedplan addressed by the clliptlcal frasment in orderto interpret It properly.
More recently, Litmanand Allen(198q) have extended Allen's model to ahierarchy of  task-plans and meta-plans.
Litman iscurrently studying the interpretation of ellipti-cal frasments within this enhanced framework.In  add i t ion  to the syntact i c ,  semant ic ,  andp lan -based  s t ra teg ies ,  a few other  heur i s t i cs  havebeen ut i l i zed .
Carbusol l (1983)  uses  d i scourseexpectat ion  ru les  that  suggest  a se t  of expecteduser  u t te rances  and re la te  e l l ip t i ca l  f~a~ents  tothese  expected  pat terns .
For example, i f  the sys -t~a asks the  user  whether  a par t i cu la r  valueshould be used an the  f i l l e r  o?
a s lo t  in  a casefrane, the system then expects the user's utter-ance to contain a confirmation or disson~Irmatlonpattern, a different filler for the slot, a com-parative pattern such as "too hard", and so forth.Although these rules use expectations about howthe speaker m~ght respond, they seem to have llt-tle to do with the expected discourse goals of thespeaker.Real understanding consists sot only ofresognlzAr~ the particular surface-request orsurface-lnform, but also of inferring what thespeaker wants to accomplish and the relationshipof each utterance to this task.
Interpretation ofellipsis based upon the speaker's inferred under~lying task-related plan and discourse Eoals facil-itates a richer interpretation of ellipticalutterances.REQUISITE KNCWLEDG EA speaker can felicitously employ intersen-tentlal ellipsis only Lf he believes his utterancewill be properly understood.
The motivation forthis work is the hypothesis that speaker andhearer mutually believe that certain knowledge hasbeen acquired during the course of the dialogueand that  th i s  fac tua l  knowledge a long with  o therp rocess ing  knowledge w i l l  be used to deduce thespeaker,s intentions.
We claim that the requisitefactual knowledge includes the speaker,s inferredtask-related plan, the speaker's inferred beliefs,and the anticipated discourse Eoala of thespeaker; We claim that the requisite processingknowledge includes plan recognltlon strategies andfocuslng techniques.1.
Task-Related PlanIn a cooperat ive  in fo rmat ion -seek ing  dAelo-gue, the ln~ormat ion -prov ider  i s  expected to i n fe rthe i r~ors~at ion -seeker ,  s under ly ing  task - re la tedp lan an the d ia logue pro~-eases .
At any po in t  Anthe d ia lo~e,  ZS ( the  in fo rmat ion -seeker )  be l ievesthat  soae subset  of  th i s  p lan has been coemunA-mated to  IP ( the  in~ormat ion -prov ider ) ;  there foreY~ feeAa J ua t l .
r led  in  ~ormuAating u t te rances  underthe assumption that IP will use this i n fe r red  taskmodel to interpret utterances, includIDg elliptl-eLL frasmente.189An example will illustrate the importance ofIS's inferred task-related plan in interpretingellipsis.
In the following, IS is conslder i~purchase  of  a home ment ioned  ear l ie r  in the  d ia lo -~ue:IS: "What elementary school do childrenin Rolling Hills attend?
"ZP: "They attend Castle Elementary.
"IS: "Any nearby seim clubs?
"An i n fo rmal  poll indicates that most people inter-pret the last utterance as a request for swimclubs near the property under consideration inRolling Hills and that  the reason  fo r  such aninterpretation is their inference that  IS isinvestigating recreational facilities that mightbe used if IS were to purchase the home.
However,if we substitute the frasment?
An~ nearby day-care  centers?
"for the last utterance in the dialogue, theninterpretation depen~ upon whether one believesIS wants hls/her children to be bused, or perhapseven walk, to day-care directly from school.2.
Shared BeliefsShared beliefs of facts, beliefs which thelistener believes speaker and iistecer mutuallyhold, are a second component of factual knowledgerequired for processing intersentential ellipticalfra6ments.
These shared beliefs either representpresueed a priori knowledge of the domain, such asa pres~ptlon that dia logue participants in aunAvere i ty  domain know that  each course  has  ateacher, or beliefs derived from the dialogueitself.
An e~ple  of the latter occurs i~ IPtells IS that C3360 is a 5 credit hour course; ISmay not himself believe that C3360 is a 5 credithour course, but as a result of IP's utterance, hedoes believe it is mutually believed that IPbelieves this.Understanding utterances requires that weidentify the speaker's discourse goal in makingthe utterance.
Shared beliefs, often calledmutua l  beliefs, form a par t  of  communicatedknowledge used to in terpret  u t te rances  and iden-t i f y  discourse goals in a cooperative dlalogue.The following e~a~le  illustrates how IP' s beliefsabout IS influence usderstan~Ing.IS: "Who is teaching C~O0?
"IP: "Dr. Brown is teaching C.~O0.
"IS:  "At ni~t?
"The frasmentar~ utterance "At n i~t?"
is a requestto know whether CS~O0 is meeting at night.
Hc~-ever, if one precedes the above utterances with aquer~ whose rms~onse informs IS that CS~O0 meetsonly a t  ni~t,  then  the last utterance,?
At n i~t?
=becomes an ob jec t ion  and request for cor roborat ionor  e~lanatlon.
The reason for this difference ininterpretation is the difference in beliefsregarding IS at the time the elliptical fragmentis uttered.
In the latter case, IP believes it Asmutually believed that IS already knows IP' sbeliefs regarcl ing when C/~O0 meets, so a requestfor that informatlon is not felicitous and a dif-ferent intention or discourse goal is attributedto L~.Allen and Perrault(1980) used mutual beliefsin their work on indirect speech acts and sug-~sted  the i r  use in clarification and correctiondlalogues.
~idner(1983) models user beliefs aboutsystem capabilities in her work on recognlzlngspeaker intention in utterances.3.
Anticipated Discourse GoalsThe speaker' s anticipated discourse goalsform a third compocent of factual knowledgerequired for processing elliptical frasmenta.
Thedlalogue precedlng an elliptical utterance maysugEest discourse goals for the speaker; thesesugEested discourse gcals become shared knowledgebetween speaker and hearer.
As a result, thelistener is on the lookout fo r  the speaker to pur -sue these ant ic ipated  discourse goals and inter~~rets utterances accordingly.Consider for example the following dialogue:IP: "Have you taken C3105 or C3170?
"I~: wit the Unlversity of Delaware?
"IP: "No, anywhere.
"IS: "Yes, at Penn State.
"In this example, IP's inlt~al query produces astrong anticipation that IS will pursue thediscourse 8oal of provldlng the requested i~forma-tlon.
There/ore subsequent utterances are inter-preted with the expectation that IS will eventu-ally address this 8oal.
IS's first utterance isinterpreted as ~u-sulng a discourse Eoal of seek-ing clarification of the  question posed by IP;IS' s last utterance ansMers the initial queryposed by IP.
However discourse expectatlons donot persist forever with intervening utterances..
Processing ~owledpP1 an- recognl tlon strategies and focusingtechniques are necessary components of processingknowledge for interpreting intersententlaleillpsis.
Plan-recognltion strategies are  essen-tial I- order to In/er a model of the speaker'sunderlying task-related plan and focusing tech-niqces are necessary in order to identIDi thatportion of the underlying plan to which a frasmen-tar7 utterance refers.Focusing mechanAas  have been employed byGross(1977)  in  ident i fy ing  the  re fe rents  of  de f in -i te  noun phrases ,  by Robinson(1981)  in  in terpret -ing verb  p~vases, by ~ner (  1981 ) in anaphoraresolution, by CarberrT(1983) in plan inference,and by McKeown(19fl~) in natural lan&uage genera-t~on.190FRAmeWORK FOR PROCESSING ELLIPSLSIf an utterance is parsed as a sentence frag-ment, ellipsis processing begins.
A model of anypreceding dialogue contains a context tree (Car-berry, 1983) corresponding to IS's inferred under-lying task-related plan, a space containing IS'santicipated discourse goals, and a belief modelrepresenting IS's inferred beliefs.Our framework is a top-down strategy whichuses the informatlon-seeker' s anticipateddiscourse goals to guide interpretation of thefragment and relate it to the underlying task-related plan.
The discourse component firstanalyzes the top element of the discourse stackand suggests potential discourse goals which ISmight be expected to pursue.
The plan analysiscomponent uses the context tree and the beliefmodel to suggest possible associations of theelliptical fragment with aspects of IS's inferredtask-related plan.
If multiple associations aresuggested, the evaluation component appliesfocusing strategies to select the interpretationbelieved intended by the speaker --- namely, thatmost appropriate to the current focus of attentionin the dialogue.
The discourse component thenuses the results produced by the analysis com-ponent to determine if the fragment accomplishesthe proposed discourse goal; if so, it interpretsthe fragment relevant to the identified discoursegoal.PLAN-ANALYSIS COMPONENTI.
Association of FragmentsThe plan-analysls component is responsiblefor associating an elliptical fragment with a termor conjunction of propositions in Is's underlyingtask-related plan.
The analysis component deter-mines, based  upon the .current focus of attention,the particular aspect of the plan highlighted byIS's fragment and the discourse goal rules inferhcw IS intends the fra@Rent to be interpreted.This paper will discuss three classes of ellipti-cal fragments; a description of how other frag-ments are associated with plan elements is pro-vided in (Carberry, 1985).A constant fragment can only associate withterms whose semantic type is the same or a super-set of the semantic type of the constant.
Further-more, each term has a limited set of valid instan-tlations within the existing plan.
A constantassociates with a term only if IP's beliefs indi-cate that IS might believe that the uttered con-stant is one of the te.,-m's valid instantiations.For example, if a plan contains the propositionStarting-Date( AI-CONF, JAN/5)the elliptical fragment?
February 2?
"wall associate w~th this proposition only if IPbelieves I3 might believe that the starting datefor the AS conference is in February.Recourse to such a belief model is necessaryin order to allow for Yes-No questions to whichthe answer is "No" and yet eliminate potentialassociations which a human listener would reCOg-nize as unlikely.
Although this discarding ofpossible associations does not occur often ininterpreting elliptical fragments, actual humandialogues indicate that it is a real phenomenon.
(Sidner(1981) employs a similar strategy in herwork on anaphora resolution.
A co-specifler pro-posed by the focusing rules must be confirmed byan inference machine; if any contradications aredetected, other co-specifiers are suggested.
)A propositional fragment can be of two types.The first contains a proposition whose name is thesame as the name of a proposition in the plandomain.
The second type is a more general propo-sitional fragment which cannot be associated witha specific plan-based proposition until afteranalyzing the relevant propositions appearing inIS's plan.

A propositionof the second type associates with any propositionwhose ~arameters include terms associating withthe known parameters of the propositional frag-ment.The semantic representation of a term such as"The meeting time?
"is a variable term_~me : &MTG- TMESSuch a term associates with terms of the samesemantic type in IS's plan.
Note that the exlst-ing plan may contain constant instantiatlons inplace of former variaOles.
A term fragment stillassociates with such constant terms.2.
Results of Plan-Analysis ComponentThe plan-analysis component constructs a con-junction of propositions PLPREDS and/or a te rmPLTERM representing that aspect of theinformatlon-seeker' s plan highlighted by theelliptical fragment; STERM and SPREDS are producedby substituting into PLTERM and PLPREDS the termsin IS's fragment for the terms with which they areassociated in IS's plan.191(1)mEarn-Credit(IS,CS360,FALL85)such thatCourse-Offered(CS360,FALL85)\]i(1)~Earn-Cre~t-Sectlon(IS,_ss:&SECTIONS)such thatI s -  ~ect ion -Of (_ss :  &3ECTION S, ~360 )Is- Of fere,~(_ss: &SECTION S, FALL85 )(1)~iearn-Materlal(IS,_ss:&SEcTIONS,_s~l:&SYLBI)such thatIs-Syllabus-Of(_ss:&SECTIONS,_s~l:&SYLBI)i(1)ILearn-Frem(I~,_fac:aSECTIONS,_ss:&SECTIONS)such thatTeaches(_fae:&FACULTY,_ss:&SECTIONS)\[i(1)IAttend-CIass(IS,_day:&MTG-DAYS,_tme:&MTG-T~S,~Ic:&MTG-PLC3)such thatIs- Mt g-Day (_ss: &SECTION S, day :  &MTG- T~S )Is-Mtg-Time (_ss: &SECT ION S,_tme: &~-  T~S )Is-Mtg-PIc(_ss:&SECTIONS,_plc:&MTG-~C~)J(1)'iearn-Text(IS,_txt:&TEXTS)such thatUses(_ss:&SECTIONS,_txt:&TEXTS)Figure I: A Portion of the Expanded Context Tree forIt appears that h,-,ans retain as much of theestablished context as possible in interpretingintersententlal ellipsis.
Carbonell(1983) demon-strated this phemonenon in an informal poll inwhich users were found to interpret the fraRmentin the followlng dialogue as retaining the fixedmedia specification:"What is the size of the 3 largestsingle port fixed media disks?
""disks with two ports?
"We have noted the same phenomenon in a studentadvisement domain.Thus when an elliptical fragment associateswith a portion of the task-related plan or anexpansion of one of its actions, the context esta-bllshed by the preceding dlalogue must be used toreplace information deleted from this streamlined,frae~mentary utterance.
The set of ACTIVE nodes inthe context model form a stack of plans, the toP-most of whlca is the current focused plan; eachof these plans is the expanslon of an actionappearing in the plan Immediately beneath it inthis stack.
These ACTIVE nodes represent theestablished Elobal context within w~ich the frag-mentary utterance occurs, and the propositionsappeaclng along this path contain informationmissing frca the sentence fragment but ;~'esumedunderstood by the speaker.I f  the e l l ip t i ca l  fragment l s  a p ropos i t ion ,the ana lys i s  component produces a con junct ion  ofp ropos i t ions  3PREI~ represent ing  that  aspect  otthe plan hi~hi i~ted bY IS's el!iptlcal fra~ent.EXAM~E- IIf the elliptical fragment is a constant, term, orterm with attached propositions, the analysis com-ponent produces a term STERM associated with theconstant or term in the fraRment as well as a con-Junction of  propositions SPREDS.
SPREDS consistsof all propositions along the paths from the rootof the context tree to the nodes at which an ele-ment of the frasment is associated with a planelement, as well as all propositions appearingalong the previous ACTIVE path.
The formerrepresent the new context derived from IS's frs4-mentary utterance whereas the latter retain thepreviously established global context.3.
E~mpleThis example illustrates how the plan-analysis component determines that aspect of IS'splan hi~l lg~ted by an elliptical fragment.
Italso shows how the established context is main-rained in interpreting ellipsis.IS: "Is C3360 offered in Fall 1985?

The evaluation component employs focusingstrategies to select what it believes to be theinterpretation intended by 13 --- namely, thatinterpretation most relevant to the current focusof attention in the dialogue.We employ the notion of focus domains inorder to group finely grained actions and associ-ated plans into more general related structures.A focus domain consists of a set of actions, oneof which is an ancestor of all other actions inthe focus domain and is called the root of thefocus domain.
If as action is a member of a focusdomain and that  ac t ion  i s  not  the  root  ac t ion  o fanother  focus  domain, then a l l  the  ac t ions  con-talnad in the plan associated with the firstaction are a lso members of the focus domain.
(This is similar to Grosz's focus spaces and thenotion of an object being in implicit focus.
)The use o f  focus  domains a l lows  the  group in8together  of those  act ions  that  appear  to be a tapproximately the sa~me level of Impllcit focuswhen a plan is explicitly focused .
For example,the actions of learnlr~ from a particular teacher,learning the material in a given text, and attend-Ing class will all reside at the same focus levelwithin the expanded plan for earning credit in acourse.
The action of going to the cashler'soffice to pay one's tuition also appears withinthis expanded plan; however it will reside at adifferent focus level since it does not come tomind nearly so readily when one thinks about tak-ing a course.The following are two of seven focusing rulesused to select the association deemed mostrelevant to the existing plan context.\[F1\] Within the current focus space, prefer asso-clatlons which occur within the currentfocused plan.IF2\] Within the current focus space and currentfocused plan, prefer associations within theactions to achieve the most recently con-sidered action.DISCOURSE GOALSWe have analyzed dialogues from several dif-ferent domains and have identified elevendiscourse goals which occur during information-seeking dialogues and which may be accomplishedvia elliptical fragments.
Three exemplaryd iscourse  goals are\ [ ; \ ]  Obtaln-In/ormatlon: IS requests Ir.formatlonrelevant to constructing the underlyingtask-related plan or relevant to formulatingan answer to a question posed by IP.\[2\] Obtaln-Corroboration: IS expresses surpriseregarding some proposition P and requestselaboration upon and justification of it.\[33 Seek-Clarify-questlon: IS requests informa-tion relevant to clarifying a question posedby ZP.ANTICIPATED DISCOURSE GOALSWhen IS m~es  an utterance, he is attemptingto accomplls~ a discourse goal ; this discoursegoal may in turn predict other suDsequentdiscourse goals for IS.
For e~p le ,  if I~ asks aquestion, one anticipates that IS may want toexpand upon his question.
Similarly, utterancesmade by IP suggest dlsoourse goals for LS.
TheseAatlcipated Discourse Goals provide very strongexpectations for IS and may often be accomplishedimplicitly as well as explicitly.The discourse ~a ls  of the previous sectionalso serve as anticipated discourse goa ls .
Threeadditional anticipated discourse goals appear  tOplay a major role in determining how ellipticalfragments are interpreted.
One such anticipateddiscourse ~a l  is:193Accept-Questlon: IP has posed a question toIS; IS must now accept the question eitherexplicitly, implicitly, or indicate that hedoes not as yet accept it.Normally dialogue participants accept such ques-tions implicitly by proceding to answer the ques-tion or to seek information relevant to formulat-ing an answer.
However IS may refuse to acceptthe  quest ion  posed by IP because he does  notunders tand  I t  (perhaps  he i s  unab le  to ident i fysome of the  ent i t ies  ment ioned  in  the  quest ion)  o rbecause  he i s  surpr i sed  by i t .
Th i s  leads  todiscourse goals such as seeking confirmation,seeking the identity of an entity, seeking clarif-ication of the posed question, or expressingsurprise at the question.THE DISCOURSE STACKThe discourse stack contains anticipateddiscourse goals which IS is expected to pursue.Anticipated discourse goals are pushed onto orpopped from the stack as a result of utterancesmade by IS and IP.
We have identified a set ofstack processing rules which hold for simpleutterances.
Three examples of such stack process-Ing rules are:\[SP1\]When IP asks a question of IS, Answer-Question and Accept-Questlon are pushed ontothe discourse stack.\[SP2\]When IS poses a question to IP, Expand-Question is pushed onto the discourse stack.Once IP begins answering the question, thestack is popped up to and including theExpand-Questlon discourse goal.\[SP3\]When IS's utterance does not pursue a goalsugEested by the top entry on the discoursestack, this entry is popped from the stack.The motivation for these rules is the following.When IP asks a question of IS, IS is firstexpected to accept the question, either implicitlyor expllcltly, and then answer the question.
Uponposing a question to ~P, IS is expected to expandupon this question with subsequent utterances orwait u~tll IP produces an answer to the question.Alt~oug~ the strongest expectations are that ISwill pursue a goal suggested by the top element ofthe discourse stack, this ant ic ipated  discoursegoal can be passed over, at which point it nolonger sug~sts  expectations for utterances.DISCOURSE INTERPRETATIOM COMPOM~TThe discourse component employs discourseexpectation rules and discourse goal rules.
Thediscourse expectation rules use the discoursestack to suggest possible discourse goal s fo r  L~and activate the associated discourse goal rules.These disnourse goal rules ttse the p lan-ana lys i scomponent to help determine the best interpreta-tion of the fra~entar7 utterance relevant to thesug~sted discourse goal.
If a discourse goalrule succeeds in producing an interpretation, thenthe discourse component identifies that discoursegoal and its associated interpretation as itsunderstanding of the utterance.I.
Discourse Expectation RulesThe top element of the discourse stackactivates the discourse expectation rule withwhich it is associated; this rule in turn suggestsdiscourse goals which the information-seeker' sutterance may pursue and activates these discoursegoal rules.
The following is an example of adiscourse expectation rule:\[DE1\]If the top element of the discourse stack isAnswer-Question, thenI.
Apply discourse goal rule DG-Answer-Questto determine if the elliptical fragment isbeing used to accomplish the discourse goalof answering the question.2.
If no interpretation is produced, applyrule S-Suggest-Answer-Questlon to determineif the elliptical fragment is being used toaccomplish the discourse goal of suggestingan answer to the question.3.
If no interpretation is produced, applydiscourse goal rule DG-Obtaln-Info to deter-mine if the elliptical fragment is being usedto accomplish the discourse goal of seekinginformation in order to construct an answerto the posed question.Once IS understands the question posed to him,IP's strongest expectation is that IS will answerthe question; therefore first preference is givento interpretations which accomplis~ this goal.
IfIS does not immediately answer the question, thenwe expect a cooperative dialogue participant towork towards answering the question.
This entailsgathering information about the underlying task-related plan in order to construct a response.2.
Discourse Goal RulesDiscourse goal rules determine if an elllptl-cal fragment accomplishes the associated discoursegoal and, i f  so, produce the appropriateinterpretation of the fragment.
These discoursegoal rules use the plan-analysls component to helpdetermine the best interpretation of the frasmen-tary utterance relevant to the suggested discoursegoal.
However these interpretations are notactual representations of surface speech acts;instead they generally indicate elements of theplan whose values the speaker is querying orspecifying.
In many respects, this provides abetter "understanding" of the utterance since itdescribes what the speaker is trying to accom-p l i~.The following is an example of a rule associ-ated with a discourse goal suggested by the stackentry Accept-Response; the latter is pushed ontothe discourse stack when IP responds to a questionposed by IS.194Obtain-CorrobThe discourse component calls the plan-analysis component to associate the ellipti-cal fragment with a term STERM or a conjunc-tion of propositions SPREDS in IS's underly-ing task-related plan.
If IP believes it ismutually believed that IS already knows IP'sbeliefs about the value of the term STERM orthe truth of the propositions $PREDS, thenidentify the elliptical fragment as accom-plishing the discourse ~a l  of expressingsurprise at the preceding response; in par-tlcular, IS is surprised at the known valuesof STEP=M or SPREDS in li@~t of the new infor-met.lon provided by IP' s preceding responseand the known aspect queried by IS's frag-ment.The followin8 is one of several rules associ-ated with the discourse ~a l  Answer-Question.J~Ct" Answer- Oues t--~.If the elliptical fragment terminates with aperiod, then the discourse component callsthe plan-analysls component to associate theelliptical frasment with a conjunction ofpropositions SPEEDS in IS's underlying task-related plan.
If successful, interpret theelliptical fragment as answerlr~ "Yes", withthe restriction that the propositions SPREDSbe satlsfi~d in the underlyin~ .i ~n.IMPLE}~NTATION AND EXAMPLESThis pragmatics-based framework for process-ing intersententlal ellipsis has been implementedfor a subset of discourse goals in a domain con-slstln8 of the courses, policies, and requlrementsfor students at a unlverslty.
The following areworklng examples from this implementation.The ellipsis processor is presented with asemantic representation of Is's elliptical frag-ment; it "understands" intersententlal ellipticalutterances by Identlfyin8 the discourse goal whichI~ is pursuing in employing the frasment and byproducing a plar,-Oased interpretation relevant tothis discourse goal.This e,-=mple illustrates a simple request forinformation.IS :  "Is CS360 offered in Fall 19857"IP :  "Yes.
"IS: "Do any sections meet on Monday?
"IP: "One section of C3360 meets on Monday at qPMand another section meets on Monday at 7PM.
"IS: "The text?
"Immediately prior to IS's elliptical utter-.
ante, the discourse stack contair~ the entriesAcre pt- ResponseObtaln-InformatlonThe discourse goal rules sugEested by Accept-Response do not identify the fragment as accom-plishing their associated discourse Eoals, so thetop entry of the discourse stack is popped; thisindicates that IS has implicitly accepted IP' sresponse.
The entry Obtaln-Informatlon on thediscourse stack activates the rule DG-Obtaln-In/'o.Pl an- analy sl s is activated to associate theelliptical fragment with an aspect of I$'s task-related plan.
The construction of 5TERM andSPREDS for this ezample was described in detail inthe plan analysis section and will not be repeatedhere.
Since our belief model indicates that ISdoes not currently know the value of STERM suchthat SPREDS is satisfied, this rule identifies theelliptical fragment as seeking information inorder to formulate a task-related plan; in partic-ular, I -~ is requestlng the value of STERM suchthat SPREDS is satisfied --- namely, the textbookused in sections of C3360 that meet on Monday inthe Fall of 1985.This example illustrates an utterance in which ISis surprised by IP's response and see~s elabora-tion and corroboration of it.
(The constructionof $PREDS by the plan analysis component will notbe described since it is similar to EXAMPLE-I.

The discourse goal rules Seek-Conflrmand Seek-Identlfy fail to identify their associ-ated discourse goals as accomplished by the user'sfragment.Ou~ belief model indicates that IS alreadyknows that SPREDS is satisfied; therefore thediscourse goal rule DG-Obtain-Corrob identifiesthe elliptical fragment as expressing surprise atand requesting corroboration of IP's response.
Inparticular, IS is surprised that SPRED~ is satis-fied and this surprise is a result of\[I\] the new information presented in IP's preced-ing response, namely that 8AM is the value ofthe term_tae: &MTG- T~Si n  the  SPREDS propos i t ionIs- Mt g-Tiae(_ss: &SECTION S,_tme: ~ T~S )C2\] the aspect of the plan queried by IS'selliptical fra~ent, namely the SPREDS propo-sitionTeaches ( SMITH ,_ss: &SECTIONS)EXA~ELFclThe following is an example which our frameworkhandles but which poses problems for other stra-te61es.IS: "I want to register for a course.But I massed pre-reglstration.The cost?
"The first two utterances establish a plan contextof late-reglstering, within which the ellipticalf ra~ent  requests the fees involved in doing so.
( Late registration generally involves extrachargos.
)Figure 2 presents a portion of 13' s underly-ing task-related plan Inferred frca the utterancespreceding the elliptical frasment.
Theparenthesized numbers preceding actions indicatethe action's focus domain.
I~'s fragment associ-ates with the term_ireg: &MONEYin IS' s inferred plan, as well as with terms else-where in the plan.
However none of the otherterms appear in the same focus space as the mostrecently considered action, and therefore theassociation of the fragment with_lreg: &MONEYis selected as most relevant to the current dlalo-gue context.

"IF: "Dr. Herd is the teacher of C3200.
"IS: "C32637"Obviously IS' s elliptical fragment requests theteacher of C3263.
Our model cannot currently han-dle such fragments.
This limitation is partiallydue to the fact that our mechanlems for retainingd ia logue  context  a re  based upon the  view that  ISconstructs a plan for a task in a deptb-flrstfashlon, completing Investlgation of a plan forC3200 before moving on to investigate a plan forCS263.
Since the teacher of C3200 has nothing todo with the plan for taking C3263, the mechanismsfor retaining dialogue context will fail to iden-tify ?
teacher of CS263" as the informationrequested by IS.One might argue that the elliptical fragmentin the above dialogue relies heavily upon the syn-tactic representation of the preceding utteranceand thus a syntactic strategy is required forinterpretation.
This may be true.
However if weview dialogues such as the above as investigatingtask-related plans in a kind of "breadth-flrst"fa~hlon, then IS is analyzing the teachers of eachcourse under consideration first, and will thenmove to considering other attributes of thecourses.
It appears that the plan-based frameworkcan be extended to handle many such dialogues,perhaps by using meta-plans to represent how IS isconstructing his task-related plan.CON CL USION SThis paper ha~ described a pragmatlcs-basedapproach to interpreting intersententlal ellipti-cal utterances during an information-seekingdialogue in a task domsin.
Our framework coordl-nares many knowledge sources, including theinformatlon-seeker' s inferred task-related plan,his inferred beliefs, his ant ic ipated  discoursegoals, and focusing strategies to produce a richinterpretation of ellipsis, including identifica-tion of the Ir~ormatlon-seeker's d/scourse goal.This framework can handle many e-~mples wblch poseproblems for other strate~Les.
We claim that theadvantage of tbls approach is its reliance uponpragmatic information, including discourse contentand conversational goa ls ,  ra ther  than upon preciserepresentations of the preceding utterance alone.ACKN OWLEDG E~ TST would llke to thank Ralph Welschedel forhis encouragement and direction in this researchand Lance Remsbaw for many help/ul ~Iscusslons andsuggestlons.REFERENCESI.
