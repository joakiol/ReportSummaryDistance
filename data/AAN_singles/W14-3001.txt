Charles J. Fillmore had a life-long interest in lexical semantics, andthis culminated in the latter part of hislife in a major research project, theFrameNet Project at the InternationalComputer Science Institute in Berke-ley, California (http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu).
This paper re-ports on the background of this ongoingproject, its connections to Fillmore?s otherresearch interests, and briefly outlines ap-plications and current directions of growthfor FrameNet, including FrameNets in lan-guages other than English.1 IntroductionIt was my honor to work closely with the lateCharles Fillmore as part of the FrameNet projectat the International Computer Science Institutein Berkeley, California (http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu) from 1997 until thisyear.
It was a blessing to be in contact with thatrare combination of a brilliant intellect, a compas-sionate heart, and genuine humility.
This articlewill discuss where FrameNet fits in the develop-ment of Fillmore?s major theoretical contributions(case grammar, frame semantics and constructiongrammar), how FrameNet can be used for NLP,and where the project is headed.2 From Case Grammar to FrameSemantics to FrameNetThe beginnings of case grammar were con-temporary with the development of what cameto be called the ?Standard Theory?
of Gener-ative Grammar (Chomsky, 1965), and related?through friendship?
to the simultaneous develop-ment of Generative Semantics.
Fillmore (1968)showed that a limited number of case rolescould provide elegant explanations of quite var-ied linguistic phenomena, such as the differ-ences in morphological case marking betweennominative-accusative, nominative-ergative, andactive-inactive languages, and anaphoric pro-cesses such as subject drop in Japanese.
A yearlater (Fillmore, 1969), after explaining that verbslike rob and steal require three arguments, the cul-prit, the loser, and the loot, he continues in the nextsection to sayIt seems to me, however, that this sortof detail is unnecessary, and that whatwe need are abstractions from thesespecific role descriptions, abstractionswhich will allow us to recognize thatcertain elementary role notions recur inmany situations,.
.
.
Thus we can iden-tify the culprit of rob and the criticof criticize with the more abstract roleof Agent.
.
.
in general.
.
.
the roles that[predicates?]
arguments play are takenfrom an inventory of role types fixed bygrammatical theory.But the search for the ?correct?
minimal set ofcase roles proved to be difficult and contentious,and it became apparent that some predicators, suchas replace and resemble, required roles which didnot fit into the usual categories.
In fact, the orig-inal case roles (a.k.a.
semantic roles, thematicroles, theta roles) were increasingly seen as gen-eralizations over a much larger set of roles whichprovide more detailed information about the par-ticipants in a large variety of situations, describedas semantic frames (Fillmore, 1976; Fillmore,1977b).Thus, the formulation of Frame Semanticsshould not be seen as a repudiation of the con-cept of case roles expounded in Fillmore 1968, butrather a recognition of the inadequacy of case rolesas a characterization of all the different types of1interactions of participants that can be linguisti-cally significant in using language to describe sit-uations:.
.
.
[A]s I have conceived them, therepertory of cases is NOT identical tothe full set of notions that would beneeded to make an analysis of any stateor event.
.
.
.
[A] case frame need notcomprise a complete description of allthe relevant aspects of a situation, butonly a particular piece or section of asituation.
(Fillmore (1977a), emphasisin the original)The concept of frames became part of the aca-demic zeitgeist of the 1960s and 70s.
Roger Shankwas using the term script to talk about situa-tions like eating in a restaurant (Schank and Abel-son, 1977) and the term frame was being used ina more-or-less similar sense by Marvin Minsky(1974), and Eugene Charniak (1977).FrameNet as an Implementation of FrameSemanticsDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, much ofFillmore?s effort went into joint work with PaulKay, Catherine O?Connor, and others on the de-velopment of Construction Grammar, especiallyon linking constructions in which the semantic at-tributes of various constituents were representedby thematic roles such as Agent, Patient, Expe-riencer, Stimulus, etc., (cf.
Levin (1993)).
Butsemantic frames were always presupposed in Fill-more?s discussion of Construction Grammar (e.g.Kay and Fillmore (1999)), just as ConstructionGrammar was always presupposed in discussionsof Frame Semantics.
In fact, some of the inciden-tal references to semantic frames in the literatureon construction grammar imply the existence ofvery sophisticated frame semantics.
At the sametime, Fillmore was becoming involved with thelexicographer Sue Atkins, and increasingly think-ing about what the dictionary would look like, iffreed from the limitations of publishing on paper(Fillmore and Atkins, 1994) and based on corpusdata.The FrameNet Project (Fillmore and Baker,2010; Ruppenhofer et al., 2010a) at the Interna-tional Computer Science Institute was launchedin 1997, as an effort to produce a lexicon of En-glish that is both human- and machine-readable,based on the theory of Frame Semantics and sup-ported by annotating corpus examples of the lexi-cal items.
In part, FrameNet (FN) can be thoughtof as the implementation of a theory that was al-ready well-developed, but, like other annotationprojects, we have found that the process of anno-tating actual text has also pushed the developmentof the theory.So what is a frame?
Ruppenhofer et al.
(2006)define a frame as ?a script-like conceptual struc-ture that describes a particular type of situation,object, or event along with its participants andprops.?
Frames are generalizations over groups ofwords which describe similar states of affairs andwhich could be expected to share similar sets ofroles, and (to some extent) similar syntactic pat-terns for them.
In the terminology of Frame Se-mantics, the roles are called frame elements (FEs),and the words which evoke the frame are referredto as lexical units (LUs).
A lexical unit is thus aSaussurian ?sign?, an association between a formand a meaning; the form is a lemma with a givenpart of speech, the meaning is represented as a se-mantic frame plus a short dictionary-style defini-tion, which is intended to differentiate this lexi-cal unit from others in the same frame.
Each lex-ical unit is equivalent to a word sense; if a lemmahas more than one sense, it will be linked to morethan one LU in more than one frame; e.g.
thelemma run.v (and all its word forms, run, ran, andrunning) is linked to several frames (Self-motion,Operating a system, etc.
).Some of this literature refers to two types of en-tities, frames and scenes (Fillmore, 1977c).
How-ever, early in the process of defining the FN datastructure, it was recognized that more than twolevels of generality might be needed, so it was de-cided to create only one type of data object, calleda frame, and to define relations between frames atvarious levels of generality.
Therefore, the termscene is not used in FrameNet today, althoughsome frames which define complex events havethe term scenario as part of their names, such asthe Employer?s scenario, with subframes Hiring,Employing and Firing.In many cases, the framal distinctions proposedby Fillmore in early work are directly reflectedin current FN frames, as in the pair of framesStinginess and Thriftiness, discussed in Fillmore(1985).
In other cases, the frame divisions inFN differ from those originally proposed, as in2the division of the original Commerce frame intothree frames, Commerce, Commerce buy andCommerce sell, which are connected by frame-to-frame relations.Because Frame Semantics began in the study ofverbs and valences, there was emphasis initially onrepresenting events, but the principle that a con-ceptual gestalt can be evoked by any member of aset of words also applies to relations, states, andentities, and the evoking words can be nouns, ad-jectives, adverbs, etc., as well as verbs.
For ex-ample, the Leadership frame contains both nouns(leader, headmaster, maharaja), and verbs (lead,command); FEs in the Leadership frame includethe LEADER and the GOVERNED, as in [LEADERKurt Helborg] is the CAPTAIN [GOVERNEDof theReiksguard Knights].3 Applications of FrameNetUnderlying other applications is the need formiddle-ware to carry out automatic semantic rolelabeling (ASRL).
Beginning with the work ofGildea and Jurafsky (2000; 2002), many re-searchers have built ASRL systems trained on theFrameNet data (Erk and Pad?o, 2006; Johanssonand Nugues, 2007; Das et al., 2013), some ofwhich are freely available.
Other groups have builtsoftware to suggest new LUs for existing frames,or even new frames (Green, 2004)Typical end-user applications for FrameNetinclude Question answering (Sinha, 2008) andinformation extraction (Mohit and Narayanan,2003), and using FrameNet data has enabled someimprovements on systems attempting the RTEtask (Burchardt, 2008).
The FrameNet websitelists the intended uses for hundreds of users ofthe FrameNet data, including sentiment analy-sis, building dialog systems, improving machinetranslation, teaching English as a second language,etc.
The FrameNet team have an active partner-ship with Decisive Analytics Corporation, whichis using FN-based ASRL as for event recognitionand tracking for their govenment and commercialclients.4 Some Limitations and Extensions ofthe FrameNet ModelFrameNet works almost entirely on edited text, sodirectly applying the ASRL systems trained oncurrent FN data will probably give poor resultson, e.g.
Twitter feeds or transcribed conversation.FrameNet also works strictly within the sentence,so there is no direct way to deal with text coher-ence, although FrameNet annotation does indicatewhen certain core FEs are missing from a sen-tence, which typically indicates that that they arerealized elsewhere in the text.
This feature can beused to link arguments across sentences (Ruppen-hofer et al., 2010b).Technical terms and Proper Nouns:FrameNet has taken as its mandate to cover the?core?
lexicon of English, words in commonuse, whose definitions are established by theirusage.
The number of senses per word is knownto increase with the frequency of occurrenceZipf (19491965), so the most frequent words arelikely to be the most polysemous and thereforeboth the most important and the most challengingfor NLP.
In general, the FrameNet team haveassumed that technical vocabulary, whose defi-nitions are established by domain experts, willbe handled in terminologies for each domain,such as the Medical Subject Headings of the U.S.National Library of Medicine (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html)and the Department of Defense Dictionary ofMilitary Terms (http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/).
For similarreasons, FrameNet does not annotate propernouns, also known in NLP as named entities.FrameNet cannot and has no reason to competewith the on-line resources for these domains,such as Wikipedia, lists of male and femalepersonal names, and gazetteers.
On the otherhand, Frame Semantic resources have beenproduced in several specialized domains: ThomasSchmidt created a Frame-Semantic analysis ofthe language associated with soccer (in Ger-man, English, and French) (Schmidt, 2008),http://www.kictionary.com; and lexicain the legal domain have been produced for Italian(Venturi et al., 2009) and Brazilian Portuguese(Bertoldi and Oliveira Chishman, 2012).Negation and Conditionals:FrameNet does not have representations for nega-tion and conditional sentences.
The wordsnever.adv and seldom.adv are LUs in the Fre-quency frame, but there is no recognition of theirstatus as negatives.
The general approach whichthe FrameNet team has proposed would be totreat negative expressions as parts of constructs li-3censed by constructions which have a ?negation?frame as their meaning pole, and license nega-tive polarity items over some scope in the sen-tence, but defining that scope is a notoriously dif-ficult problem.
We are just beginning to work amental spaces approach to the related problem ofconditional sentences, cf.
Dancygier and Sweetser(2005) and Sweetser (2006).
FrameNet does notinclude the word if , but does include both LUs andannotation for a number of modal verbs and othertypes of nouns and adjectives which can be usedto express conditionality, incuding the following:Frame : LUsPossibility : can, could, might, mayCapability : able.a, ability.n, can.v, poten-tial.n/a, .
.
.Likelihood: likely.a, might.v, may.v, must.v,possible.a, .
.
.5 Future directions: Expert curation vs.rapid growthAfter almost two decades of work at varying lev-els of intensity, depending on funding, FrameNetcontains almost 1200 Semantic Frames, coveringalmost 13,000 word senses (Lexical Units) , docu-mented with almost 200,000 manual annotations.This is bigger than a toy lexicon, but far fewer LUsthan WordNet or other lexicons derived automati-cally from the web.
By virtue of expert curation,the FrameNet lexical database contains a wealth ofsemantic knowledge that is unique.
The databaseis freely available from the FrameNet website.One challenge we face now is finding a way togreatly expand FrameNet in a more cost-effectiveway while preserving the accuracy and richnessof the annotation.
We have recently done somesmall-scale experiments on crowd-sourcing vari-ous parts of the process in partnership with col-leagues at Google, and the preliminary results areencouraging.Another challenge comes as a result of the suc-cess of Frame Semantics as an interlingua (Boas,2009).
There are now projects building FrameNet-style lexical databases for many different lan-guages; funded projects are creating FrameNetsfor German, Spanish, Japanese, Swedish, Chinese,French and Arabic; smaller efforts have createdFrame Semantics-based resources for many otherlanguages, including Italian, Korean, Polish, Bul-garian, Russian, Slovenian, Hebrew, and Hindi.Some are produced almost entirely via manualannotation, while others are being created semi-automatically.
The good news is that the generalresult seems to be that the frames devised for En-glish can be used for the majority of LUs in eachof these language.
The challenge is finding a wayto integrate the frame semantic work being donearound the world, to create a truly multi-lingualFrameNet.For more information on all these topics, pleasevisithttp://framenet.icsi.berkeley.eduReferencesAnderson Bertoldi and Rove Luiza Oliveira Chishman.2012.
