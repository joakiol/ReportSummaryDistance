For enabling advanced access to clinical imaging and text data, it is relevant to know what kind of knowledge the clinician wants to know or the que-ries that clinicians are interested in.
Through inten-sive interviews and discussions with radiologists and clinicians, we have learned that medical imag-ing data is analyzed - and hence queried ?
from three different perspectives, i.e.
the anatomic per-spective addressing the involved body parts, theradiology-specific spatial perspective describing the relationships of located anatomical regions to other anatomical parts, and the disease perspectivedistinguishing between normal and abnormal im-aging features.
Our aim is to establish query pat-terns reflecting those three perspectives that would typically be used by clinicians and radiologists to find patient-specific sets of relevant images.
The context of our work is in the Theseus-MEDICO1 project on cross-modal image and in-formation retrieval in the medical domain.
The focus of the work reported here is on setting up Wikipedia-based corpora of human anatomy and radiology and on obtaining a statistical profile of concepts from three semantic knowledge resourceswith these corpora: the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), the radiology lexicon RadLex, and a subset of the international classification of disease codes ICD-9 CM.
Using this information,we intend to extract relations that are likely to oc-cur between statistically relevant terms and the concepts they express.
The final goal of our work is to derive potential query patterns from the extracted set of relations that can be used in the MEDICO semantic-based1 http://theseus-programm.de/scenarios/en/medicoimage retrieval application.
For example when re-staging head and neck lymphoma, clinicians and radiologists look for information and images that report on essential radiological patterns as ?an enlargement in the dimension of the lymph node in the neck?.
Therefore, within our approach, we aim at establishing hypotheses about possible user que-ries, i.e.
the query patterns that reflect the three perspectives discussed above.
Accordingly, an ex-ample query pattern might look like this:[ANATOMICALSTRUCTURE] located_in [ANATOMICALSTRUCTURE]AND[[RADIOLOGY]IMAGE]Modality] is_about [ANATOMICALSTRUCTURE]AND[[RADIOLOGYIMAGE]Modality] shows_symptom [DISEASE SYMPTOM]Once an initial set of similar patterns has been es-tablished in this way, they will be evaluated byclinicians for their validity and relevance.2 CorporaA central aspect of the query pattern mining task is the statistical analysis of the FMA and RadLexterms in relevant text collections.
In this way rele-vance scores can be assigned to terms that allow to investigate the most likely expressed (and hence queried) relations between them.
For this purpose we need access to a representative corpus of texts that at the same time reflects the joint view of anatomy, spatial aspects of radiology and disease that we are targeting.
Patient records would be our first choice, but due to strict anonymization re-quirements these are difficult to obtain.
We there-fore constructed a corpus based on the WikipediaCategories Anatomy and Radiology.
We then ran all text sections of each corpus through a part-of-speech tagger (Brants, 2000) to extract all nouns in the corpus and to compute a relevance score (chi-square) for each by comparing anatomy and radi-ology frequencies with those in the British Na-114tional Corpus.
A next step will be to parse and an-notate sentences with predicate-structure informa-tion, which may then be used for relation extraction along the lines of (Schutz and Buitelaar, 2005).3 FMA TermsThe statistically most relevant FMA terms wereidentified on the basis of chi-square scores com-puted for nouns in each corpus.
Single word terms in the FMA and occurring in the corpus correspond directly to the noun that the term is build up of(e.g.
the noun ?ear?
corresponds to the FMA term ear).
In this case, the statistical relevance of the term is the chi-square score of the corresponding noun.
In the case of multi-word terms occurring in the corpus, the statistical relevance is computed on the basis of the chi-square score for each constitut-ing noun and/or adjective in the term, summed and normalized over the length of the term.
Thus, the relevance value for lymph node is the summation of chi-square scores for ?lymph?
and ?node?
di-vided by 2.
In order to take frequency in account, we further multiplied the summed relevance value by the frequency of the term.
This assures that only frequently occurring terms are judged as relevant.FMA Term Freq.

The most relevant RadLex terms are shown below.
As with the FMA, the most relevant RadLex terms in the anatomy corpus are centered on ?artery?.
In contrast, in the radiology corpus the RadLex relevance scores in-deed point to a radiology profile:RadLex Term Freq.

In this way we will be able to identify relationships and eventually query patterns across the three dimensions of anatomy, radiology and lymphoma research.AcknowledgmentsThis research has been supported in part by the THESEUS- MEDICO Project, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology under the grant number 01MQ07016.ReferencesBrants T.
