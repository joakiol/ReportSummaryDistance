Subordinate and super-ordinaterelations among hybrid n-grams areindexed, making StringNet a navigableweb rather than a list.
Applications includeerror detection and correction tools andweb browser-based tools that detectpatterns in the webpages that a userbrowses.1 Introduction and BackgroundThis demo introduces a suite of web-based Englishlexical knowledge resources, called StringNet andStringNet Navigator (http://nav.stringnet.org),which have been designed to give lexicographers,translators, language teachers and languagelearners direct access to the immense territory ofmultiword expressions, more specifically to thelexical patterning that falls in the gap betweendictionaries and grammar books.MWEs are widely recognized in two differentresearch communities as posing persistentproblems, specifically in the fields ofcomputational linguistics and human languagelearning and pedagogy.In computational linguistics, MWEs arenotorious as a ?pain in the neck?
(Sag et al2002;Baldwin et al2004; Villavicencio et al2005; interalia).
The high proportion of MWEs with non-canonical structures lead to parse failures and theirnon-compositional or only partially compositionalsemantics raise difficult choices between whichones to store whole and which ones to construct asneeded.
Perhaps above all, this massive family ofexpressions resists any unified treatment since theyconstitute a heterogeneous mix of regularity andidiomicity (Fillmore et al1988).The other area where they famously causedifficulties is in human language learning andteaching, and largely for reasons parallel to thosethat make them hard for NLP.
They resistunderstanding or production by general rules orcomposition, and they constitute an unpredictablemix of productivity and idiomicity.The StringNet lexico-grammatical knowledge-base has been designed to capture thisheterogeneity of MWEs by virtue of its uniquecontent and structure.
These we describe in turnbelow.2 StringNet Content: Hybrid N-gramsThe content of StringNet consists of a specialbreed of n-grams which we call hybrid n-grams(Tsao and Wible 2009; Wible and Tsao 2010).Unlike traditional n-grams, there are four differentcategories of gram type.
From specific to general(or abstract) these four are: specific word forms(enjoyed and enjoys would be two distinct wordforms); lexemes (enjoy, including all itsinflectional variations, enjoyed, enjoys, etc); roughPOS categories (V, N, etc); and fine-grained POScategories (verbs are distinguished as VVn, VVd,VVt, etc.).
A hybrid n-gram can consist of anysequence from any of these four categories with128our stipulation that one of the grams must be aword form or lexeme (to insure that all hybrid n-grams are lexically anchored).
A traditional bi-gram such as enjoyed hiking can be described by16 distinct hybrid n-grams, such as enjoyed VVg,enjoy VVg, enjoy hike, and so on.
A traditional 5-gram, such as kept a close eye on has 1024 hybridn-gram variants (45), e.g., keep a close eye on; kepta [Adj] eye on; keep a close [N][Prep]; and so on.We have extracted all hybrid n-grams ranging inlength from bigrams to 8-grams that are attested atleast five times in BNC.
StringNet?s content thusconsists of 1.6 billion hybrid n-grams (includingtraditional n-grams), each indexed to its attestedinstances in BNC.3 Structure and NavigationRather than a list of hybrid n-grams, StringNet is astructured net.
Hybrid n-grams can stand in sub-ordinate or super-ordinate relation to each other(we refer to these as parent/child relations).
Forexample, the hybrid tri-gram consider yourselveslucky has among its many parents the moreinclusive consider [prn rflx] lucky; which in turnhas among its parents the even more generalconsider [prn rflx] [Adj] and [V] [prn rflx] luckyand so on.
We index all of these relations withinthe entire set of hybrid n-grams.StringNet Navigator is the Web interface(shown in Figure 1) for navigating this massive,structured lexico-grammatical knowledgebase ofEnglish MWEs.
Queries are as simple assubmitting a Google query.
A query of the nountrouble immediately shows users (say, languagelearners) subtle but important patterns such as takethe trouble [to-V] and go to the trouble of [VVg](shown in Figure 2).
Submitting mistake yieldsmake the mistake of [VVg] and it would be amistake [to-V].
StringNet Navigator also acceptsmultiword queries, returning all hybrid n-gramswhere the submitted words or the submitted wordsand POSs co-occur.
For all queries, clicking on anypattern given in the results will display all theattested example sentences with that pattern fromBNC.
Each listed pattern for a query also giveslinks to that pattern?s parents and children or to itsexpansion (longer version) or contraction (shorterversion) (See Figure 2).4 Some ApplicationsAmong the many sorts of knowledge thatStringNet renders tractable is the degree offrozenness or substitutability available for anyMWE.
Thus, not only does a query of the noun eyeyield the string keep a close eye on.
Navigatingupward reveals that close and eye in this string canbe replaced (keep a close watch on; keep a carefuleye on; keep a tight grip on; keep a firm hold on,etc), but also that, in this same frame keep a[Adj][N] on, the verb slot occupied by keep isbasically unsubstitutable, essentially serving as alexical anchor to this expression.
Thus, due to itsstructure as a net, StringNet makes it possible toglean the degree and location(s) of the frozennessor substitutability of an MWE.4.1 Error CheckingAutomatic error detection and correction is arapidly growing area of application incomputational linguistics (See Leacock et al2010for a recent book-length review).
StringNetsupports a novel approach to this area of work.
Theflexibility afforded by hybrid n-grams makes itpossible to capture patterns that involve subtlecombinations of lexical specificity or generality fordifferent grams within the same string.
Forexample, running StringNet on BNC data showsthat ?enjoy hiking?
is best captured as an instanceof the lexeme enjoy followed by a verb in ?ingform: enjoy Vvg.
For error checking this makes itpossible to overcome sparseness.
Thus, while BNChas no tokens of either ?enjoy spelunking?
or?enjoy to spelunk,?
we can distinguish betweenthem nevertheless and detect that the former iscorrect and the latter is an error.
The wide range oferror types that can be handled by a singlealgorithm run on StringNet will be shown in thedemo.4.2 Browser-based ToolsOther tools include a toolbar that can be installedon the user?s own web browser (Wible et al2011),from which the system can detect lexical patternsin the text of the web pages the user freely browses.A ?Query Doctor?
on the toolbar detects errors inmultiword queries (submitting ?in my point ofview?
triggers the suggestion: ?from my point ofview?
).129Figure 1: StringNet Navigator front page.Figure 2: Top 2 search results for ?trouble?5 ConclusionFuture areas of application for StringNet includemachine translation (e.g., detecting semi-compositional constructions); detection of similarand confusable words for learners, documentsimilarity using hybrid n-grams as features, andStringNet Builder for generating StringNets fromcorpora of languages other than English and fromdomain-specific corpora.AcknowledgmentsThe work described in this paper was partiallysupported by the grants from the National ScienceCouncil, Taiwan (Project Nos.
