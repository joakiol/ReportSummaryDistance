Peo-ple mainly use the basic machine match-ing method which is based on dictionaryto segment Tibetan words at present,because there is no segmented Tibetancorpus which can be used for training inTibetan word segmentation.
But themethod based on dictionary is not fit toTibetan number identification.
This pa-per studies the characteristics of Tibetannumbers, and then, proposes a methodto identify Tibetan numbers based onclassification of number components.The method first tags every numbercomponent according to the class it be-longs to while segmenting, and then up-dates the tag series according to somepredefined rules.
At last adjacent num-ber components are combined to form aTibetan number if they meet a certainrequirement.
In the testing result from7938K Tibetan corpus, the identificationaccuracy is 99.21%.1 IntroductionAs a phonetic writing script, Tibetan syllablesare separated with syllable dots.
But like Chi-nese, there is no separator between Tibetanwords.
Tibetan word segmentation is essentialfor Tibetan information processing.
In recentyears, many experts did much work on Tibetanword segmentation.
CHEN Yuzhong (2003)proposed a method based on case auxiliarywords and continuous features to segment Ti-betan text.
Based on this method, using reinstal-lation rules to identify Abbreviated Words, CAIZhijie (2009) designed and implemented theBanzhida Tibetan word segmentation system.QI (2006) proposed a three level method tosegment Tibetan text.
Dolha (2007), Zhaxijia(2007), CAI Rangjia (2009) and TASHI (2009)researched the word categories and annotationscheme for Tibetan corpus and the parts-of-speech and tagging set standards.
At present,there is no corpus for Tibetan word segmenta-tion.
However, models which are used in Chi-nese word segmentation, such as HMM, ME,CRF, have to be trained with segmented corpus.As a result, we can?t use them in Tibetan wordsegmentation.
So people mainly use machinematching method based on dictionary in Tibetanword segmentation.
But machine matching cannot be used to identify Tibetan numbers becausewe can not include all numbers in the dictionary.In Tibetan text, numbers have 3 different rep-resentations.
The first is Arabic numbers, suchas ?2010?.
The second is Tibetan alphabet num-bers composed with Tibetan digital characters:?(0),?(1),?(2),?(3),?(4),?
(5), ?
(6), ?(7),719?(8),?
(9), such as ??????(2010).
The third isTibetan syllable numbers(?Tibetan numbers?
inshort) which are composed with Tibetan sylla-bles, such as ???????
(fifteen).The former twoclasses of numbers can be identified by combin-ing adjacent number characters.
However, thismethod is not fit to the third class, because someTibetan syllables are used not only in numbersbut also in other common words.According to papers written by Dolha (2007),Zhaxijia (2007), CAI Rangjia (2009) andTASHI (2009), Tibetan numbers should betaken as single words in Tibetan word segmen-tation, however, we haven?t found any paper onthe issue of the identification of Tibetan num-bers in Tibetan word segmentation.In this paper, we propose a method which isbased on classification of number componentsto identify the third class of numbers.2 Composition of Tibetan numbersIn Tibetan, we use the following syllables(words) to express the meanings of number oneto nine: ????
?????
?????
????
???
????
?????
??????
???
?,and the following different syllables for ten,hundred, thousand, ten thousand, million, tenmillion and so on: ????
?????
??????
????
?????
????
???????????????
?..Generally, Tibetan syllable numbersare composed by these syllables, but somesyllables have variants, and sometimes we haveto use different conjunctions according to thecontext.
The composition of Tibetan syllablenumbers has the following rules.1.
Number 1-10 are expressed with the syl-lables mentioned above, but sometimesvariants are used: ???(1),????(2),????(3).2.
Number ?tens?
(20, 30, 40 ?)
have theform of ?(2-9)+????.
but in ?20?, ?30?,variants of ?2?
and ?3?
are used, while in?60?, ?70?, ?80?, variant of ?ten?(???)
isused.3.
Number 11-19 have the form of????
(10)+(1-9)?, but in ?13?
and ?15?variant of ?10?(????)
is used.4.
Number 21-99, except ?tens?, have theform of ?(tens)+conjunction+(1-9)?.
Dif-ferent conjunctions are used according todifferent ?tens?
: ???
???
???
???
???
????
???
?
?.Sometimes, this form is abbreviated to?conjunction+(1-9)?.5.
In number which is larger then 100, con-junction (??)
may be used, just like?and?
in the reading of English number?115?.
Sometimes, (???)
is used to ex-press the meaning of vacancy.
For ex-ample, number ?507?
is ??????????????????????:???
(five) ?????(hundred)????
(ten)????(hasno)????
(seven).6.
Composition of numbers larger than1000 can be deduced.7.
Ordinal numeral has the form of ?
(cardi-nal numeral)+(?or??)?.8.
Multiples have the form of ???
?+ (cardi-nal numeral)?.9.
Fractions have the form of ?
(cardinalnumeral) +?+ (cardinal numeral)?.10.
Decimals have the form of ?
(cardinalnumeral) +??+(????????or???
)+ (cardinalnumeral)?.
??????????
or ?????
means thedecimal point.11.
Approximate numbers have the form of?
(cardinal numeral)+(suffix)?.
Suffix canbe one of (???
???
??????
???????
????????????????????)
according to the meaning tobe expressed.12.
Some Tibetan numbers don?t obey theabove rules.
They have no form of num-ber, but have meanings of number, suchas ???????
(first).3 Tibetan number identificationIn this paper, we call all syllables mentioned inthe previous section ?number components?
ingeneral.
For some of these number components,we can take it as a part of number when wemeet one of them.
For others, we can?t, becausethey can be used to express non-number mean-ings.
So we have to check whether it is a part ofa number according to the context when wemeet a number component.Tibetan number identification is a part of Ti-betan word segmentation.
In Tibetan word seg-720mentation system, Tibetan text is segmentedinto words by maximum matching method.
Inthis procedure, every Tibetan number is seg-mented into number components.
Then, identi-fication module combines adjacent numbercomponents when they meet a certain prede-fined rules.In this section, we first briefly introduce thewhole procedure of Tibetan word segmentation,then the classification of number componentsand the tagging method to identify Tibetannumber.3.1 Flow of Tibetan word segmentationCritical dictionarySentencebreakingPartssegmentationMaximummatching wordsegmentation &abbreviated wordidentificationCommondictionaryTibetan numberidentificationNumbercomponentdictionaryInputTibetan TextOutputSegmentationresultFigure 1.
The flow chart of Tibetan word seg-mentationAs shown in Figure 1, for the input Tibetan text,we first segment it into sentences.
Then we seg-ment each sentence into parts with case-auxiliary words.
In this procedure, a critical dic-tionary is used because case-auxiliary words canbe a part of some Tibetan words (critical words).When we meet a critical word in Tibetan text,we should not segment it into shorter words.Next, we segment each part into words andidentify the abbreviated word (CAI Zhijie, 2009)by maximum matching method with a commondictionary and the number components diction-ary.
At last, we identify Tibetan numbers andoutput word segmentation result.In the procedure of segmenting a part intowords, a Tibetan number is segmented intowords; we must ensure every one of them is anumber component.
To do this, both commondictionary and number components dictionaryare used.
As we use maximum matching method,all Tibetan number words in the common dic-tionary should be obsolete.Identification module tags each number com-ponent with a tag according to the class which itbelongs to, then updates the tags and combinesadjacent number components when they meet acertain predefined rules.3.2 Classification of number componentsWe classify number components into the fol-lowing five classes according to their functionsand ambiguity.Basic number: these number components arethe basis of Tibetan numbers.
Every one ofthem can be an independent number.
If we meetit in context, we should take it as a part of a Ti-betan number.
Including: Tibetan number 1-9(????
?????
?????
????
???
????
?????
??????
????
); ten,hundred, thousand, ten thousand, million, tenmillion and so on(????
?????
??????
????
?????
????
????????????????
); and their variants.Number prefix: when it is used as a part ofTibetan number, the next word must be a basicnumber, while the previous word may be ormay not be a number component.
Including:abbreviations of ?(tens)+conjunction?
(???
???
??????
????
???
??
); variants of 1, 2, 3(???
????
???
);decimal point(?????????and???
).Number linker: when it is used as a part ofTibetan number, both the previous word and thenext word must be number components.
Theseinclude (????
?
????).
Conjunctions (???
???
???
???????
???
??)
belong to number prefix class, so wedon?t include them in this class.
But Conjunc-tion (??)
doesn?t belong to number prefix class,we include it in this class.721Number suffix: these number componentsare used to express the meaning of ?total num-ber?, ?approximate number?, and ?ordinal num-ber?
and so on.
They follow basic number andshould be taken as a part of Tibetan numberword.
Including: ???
???
??????
???????
???????????????????
?Independent number: these number com-ponents have no form of number, but havemeanings of number, such as ???????
(first).The difference between ?basic number?
and?Independent number?
is: a basic number canbe a Tibetan number itself or a part of a Tibetannumber, while an independent number is a Ti-betan number itself, but it can?t be a part of aTibetan number.3.3 Number identificationAs shown in Figure 2, identification moduletags each number component with a tag accord-ing to the class which it belongs to, then updatesthe tags and combines adjacent number compo-nents when they meet a certain predefined rules.Figure 2.
The flow of number identificationClass TagBasic number N (Number)Number prefix P (Prefix)Number linker L (Linker)Number suffix S(Suffix)Independent number I(Independent)Other(non-number) O (Other)Table 1.
Classes and their tagsWe assign every class with a tag, as shown inTable 1.
The tagging procedure screens everysegmented part of Tibetan sentences, and tagsevery word with a tag according to the classwhich the word belongs to.
If the word is not anumber component, we tag it with ?O?
(Other).As some number components can be used toexpress non-number meanings, (the cases existin both number prefix class and number linkerclass), we have to check whether it is a part of anumber according to the context.
For numberprefix, we take it as a part of number only if it isfollowed by a basic number, while for numberlinker, only if it follows a basic number and it isfollowed by another basic number.
We definetwo rules to do this work.Rule 1: update tag series ?PN?
to ?NN?.Rule 2: update tag series ?NLN?
to ?NNN?.The tags updating algorithm applies the rulesto the current word series until no tag is updated.After tags updating, the tag of a number prefix(?P?)
is updated to ?N?
when it is a part of Ti-betan number in the context, but the tag will stillbe ?P?
when it is not a part of Tibetan number.It is the same for number linkers.Combination algorithm combines adjacentnumber components to form a Tibetan numberword.
It mainly combines continuous numbercomponents with tags ?NN?N?, and the fol-lowing word is combined too if it has a tag ?S?.The tag of the number is updated to ?N?.
Allwords with tag ?N?
or ?I?
are taken as Tibetannumbers after combination.Then the segmentation result is output.For example, for the following Tibetan sen-tence:?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
(A consider-able parts of accidents were due to the faults of1% or even 0.5% of components.
)After parts segmentation and maximummatching word segmentation, it is segmented to:???????

Then, combination algorithm combinesadjacent number components corresponding tothe continuous ?N?
tags.

Accuracy of Tibetan number identifi-cation on 6 corpusesAs there is no corpus for Tibetan word segmen-tation, we have to make experiment on originalTibetan texts.
We make use of several bookswhich are written in Tibetan, and collect manyweb pages from several Tibetan web sites.
Afterpreprocessing, we get six corpuses.
The basicinformation about the corpuses is shown in Ta-ble 2.
Note that, in Table 2, the column ?BNS?includes all sentences which have in it at leastone number component belonging to basicnumber class, while the column ?TNS?
includesall sentences which have at least one Tibetannumber in it.
The count of the former is signifi-cantly larger than the count of the later becausesome basic numbers are used in idioms andproverbs which should be segmented as singlewords, thus we don?t take them as number com-ponents under this circumstance.
Figure 3shows the results of our experiment.
As we cansee, the total identification accuracy is 99.21%.As we have included all basic numbers in ourmethod, theoretically the recall is 100%.After analyzing the results, we find thatwrongly identified words can be divided intotwo classes.
One is that there is a conjunction(??)
between two Tibetan numbers, but is takenas one Tibetan number, such as ???????????????
(tenand twenty), ??????????????????????
(ten thousand andtwenty thousand).
The other is that some Ti-betan numbers has other non-number meaningsin the context, but our algorithm takes them asnumbers.
For instance, ?????????
means 41 whenit is used as a number, but it has another mean-ing of ?similarly?
; ????????
means 75 when it isused as a number, but it has the meaning of ?thefive internal organs?.5 ConclusionTibetan syllables are separated with syllabledots.
But like Chinese, there is no separator be-tween Tibetan words.
Tibetan word segmenta-tion is essential for Tibetan information process-ing.
People mainly use machine matching inTibetan word segmentation base on dictionary.But machine matching can not be used to iden-tify Tibetan numbers because we can not in-clude all numbers in our dictionary.
This paperproposes a method to tag number componentsaccording to the classes they belong to, and thenapply predefined rules to update tag series, andnext combine adjacent number components to723form a Tibetan number.
In the testing resultfrom 7938K Tibetan corpus, the identificationaccuracy is 99.21%, which means that thismethod is feasible to be applied to Tibetan wordsegmentation.AcknowledgementWe thank the anonymous reviewers for theirinsightful comments that helped us improve thequality of the paper.ReferencesCHEN Yuzhong, LI Baoli, YU Shiwen, LAN Cuoji.2003.
