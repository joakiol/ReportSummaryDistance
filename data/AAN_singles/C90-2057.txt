Lexical gaps and idioms in machine translationDiana Santos1BM-I N t-SC Scientitic GroupR,.Alves P, edol, 9, 1000 l,isboa, Portugal(internet: dms@inesc.inesc.pt)A bstractThis paper deserihes the treatment of lexical gaps,collocation information and idioms in the English toPortuguese machine translation system PORTUGA.The perspective is strictly bilingual, in the sense that allproblems referenced above are considered to behmg to thetranM'cr phase, and not, as in other systems, to analysis orgeneration.The solution presented invokes a parser fi}r the target lan-guage (Portuguese) that analyses, producing the corre-sponding graph structure, the multiword expression selectedas the result of lexieal transfer.This process seems to bring considerable advantage in whatreadability and ease of bilingual dictionary development isconcerned, and to fiirnish maximal flexihility together withminimal storage requirements.
Finally, it also providescomplete independence between dictionary -rod grammarformalisms.Organization' lhe  general architecture of" the MT system is at first de-scribed very briefly, emphasizing the features relevant tothe full understanding of the problem at hand.
Then timproblem is presented, and a literature survey given.
Thesolution put tbrward is then described.
Finally, we fiwnisha detailed example, together with some evaluation results.The general M T systemThe structure of the transfer MT system POR.TUGA is il-lustrated in Figure 1.Figure I.

Bilingual dictionary being kept to a minimum, onlythe selection conditions for lexical transfer andcontrastive knowledge are stored.
It should also bementioned that all intbrmation in this dictionary isassociated with the translations, and not to the Englishindex, as is usual for lexical transfer in MT.The reader is suggested to consult \[131 or \[14\] \['or moredetails.The problemVagueness, together with non overlapping of' semanticfields across different languages is widely known to give riseto lexical gaps, and lexical ambiguity.For this reason, lexical transfer, the process of choosing thecorrect equivalent(s) for one lexical entry in another lan-guage, is one of the most ditticult problems that MT has tocope with.This paper focuses on one aspect of lexical transfer, namelythe possibility to specify complex translations in the targetlanguage.
Under this broad description, the use of complex(henceforth multiword) expressions, change of part-of-speech required bY translation, and collocation restrictions,are meant..The process of actually choosing which entry (or entries)in the bilingual dictionary is more appropriate, and whichin\[brmation is taken into account for that process has beendescribed elsewhere\[ 13I.Some examples of instances of complex translation (in op-position to simple translation, in the sense of word to oneword translation, same part-of-speech, independently of thenumber o f  possible choices available) will illustrate theproblem in the context of f'nglish-to-Portuguese trans-lation.l-to-N wordsmiss - sentir a faltamiss - deixar escapardrop - deixar cairkick - dar um pontap6tonight - hoje 5. nodegraduate - firar o cursoN-to-I wordshave fun - divertir-seget up early - madrugarfall in love - apaixonar-setake advantage - aproveitartelevision set - televisorswimming pool - piscinaN-to-M wordskick the bucket - hater as bolaslose one's temper - pcrdcr a paci6nciaFigure 2.

z ,~  ?Other approachesIn this section I mention related work and alternative sol-utions that have been proposed and which l lind represen-tative of the present day state-of-art.
'l'herelbre, primitiveapproaches uch as, for instance, treatment of complexexpressions as simple strings will not be surveyed.Machine translation:It is acknowledged by outstanding machine translation re-searchers that there are MT problems which are bilingualin nature.
R.egarding the problem of lexical transfer,l'sujii\[17\] states"we cannot enumerate, by monolingual thinking, differentconcepts denoted by the verb 'produce'.
(...) Only when weare asked to translate sentences into another language, canwe try to find appropriate target language words.
(...) Theabove discussion bnplies that certain 'understanding proe-e~es" are target language dependant, and cannot be fullyspecified in a monolingual manner.
"Specitically the problem of translating a word for an ex-pression, is one of the reasons presented by Schenk\[15\] to-se the concept of "Complex Basic Expressiorff in the de-~;crlption of one language.
(A CBE is a basic expressionliom a semantic point of view, i.e., it corresponds toa basicmearfing, and a complex expression from a syntacticalpoint of vie,,,,'.
)"Expressions that are not idiomatic, but that consist of morethan one word can be handled by means of a complex basicexpression in order to retain the isomorphyJThis approach is related to the theoretical requirement ofIhe Rosetta MT system to btfild isomorphic grammars forihe several l:nlguages dealt with by tim system?
"Ibis implies that, in this ti'amework, it is the set of all lan-guages in presence that delines what is a basic meaning.15ke this, it is possible to dispense altogether with structuralIrarlsfer~"Structural transfer is not neees.rary, since idioms are basedonto basic meaningsJhx general, however, most M'F systems do not make theanalysis phase dependant on the target language(s), andtherefore it is usual to see statements like the following\[4\]:"the lexical rule must mark words with the correspondingparts of speech,", in the "cases where a source languageentry must be rephrased in the target language as an ad-hoecombination of words which does not form a lexiealentity".It is unclear, however, how much complexity of the resultcan be handled, or how rnuch syntactical transfo,mationthe new expression carl suffer.Some hybrid approaches cart also be found in \[9\], this timeapparently putting the burden on the generation phase:"The second substep of German morphological generationis the application of German word list transformations.
(.
.
)these rules can also be used to handle non-compositionaltranslations.
For example, "for example" can translatecompositionally into far Beispiel, and then a GPltRASErule can convert his to zum Beispiel.
"l lowever, the more comprehensive way to deal with thisproblcnL wilhout changing analysis accordingly, is the onecxemplilied by Isabcllc\[7\].
It was developed"a special anguage called LEXTRA, which makes it easierto state the type of tree transformations required by lexicaltransfer.
(...) LEXTRA takes as data an explicit de-scription of the admissible tree structures, and guaranteesthat any tree it receives or creates is bMeed an admi~'ibletree".Similar solutions can be found in the Japanese-to-I!nglishsystem of\[10\], which handles both lexical gaps and changesof part of speech:"One can specify not only the Engh'sh main verbs but alsoarbitrmT phrases governed by the verbs as constants", al-lowing for variables and complex patterns in tile lexicalrules.
"one can provide lexieal rules directly in GRADE,and attach them to specific items.
(...) One can specifyspecific tree transformations in GRADE".and in the old ITS translation system\[12\]:"The contents of these records" (dictionary entries) "#rcludetransfer language statements which performs the necessarytransfers as well as other referential information.
"ParsingIn parsing, idioms have to be considered.
A recent paperon idiom processing\[1\] lists some of their relevant proper-ties (my rephrasing):?
usual existence of ambiguity between literal andMiomatic readings,?
frequent discontinuity of idioms,?
applicability of regular application of syntactic rules(like adverb(s) or auxiliaJ T verb(s) insertion),?
applicability of "transformations' to the idioms proper,(like passivation or relativization).The difference between "non-literal reading" and"idiomatic" reading of an expression is also pointed out.Metaphoric readings are proposed to be parsed by usu.:drules.
The advantages of submitting idioms to "regular"syntactic rules and even to 'transformations', wheneverpossible, are emphasized.A more extreme view can be found in Gazdar et al3 l, whoignore idioms as far as syntax is concerned:"no additional devices need be added to the syntax in ac-counting for the peculiarities of fixed expressions".
Sincenot only idioms can be assigned internal syntactic structure,but an internal semantic structure as well, as "all syntac-tically active idiomatic expressions have a metaphoricalbasis".However, radically different views can be found Ibr in-stance in \[5\], where, in the lexicon-grammar approach, theconcern with the representation of compound words(adverbs, verbs, nouns) makes Gross establish a classilica-lion according to their syntactical shape, ranging fiom se-veral degrees of variation, li'om completely frozen ("atnight") to having parts completely free ("organize in one'shonor").This author suggests that finite automata be attached to agiven entry in Order to describe the compound wtriation.
"The variations of form we have enumerated can be partlyhandled by attaching a finite automaton to a given entry,and this automaton will describe the main grammaticalchanges allowed.
"In between, the need to store several pieces of infbrmationconcerning idioms is acknowledged by Stockllf\], such as2 331undergoing passivization, weight in the whole idiom, re-mover of the idiom interpretation, semantic value, etc.This system stores idioms as "further information concern-ing words", divided in two cases, "canned phrases" and"flexible idioms", the latter being stored under the 'thread'of tile idiom.Based on the claim that "the flexibility of an idiom dependson how recognizable its metaphorical origin is", one of thegoals is to "integrate idioms in our lexical data merely asfurther information concerning words (as in traditionaldictionaries)".GenerationFinally, research in natural language generation has alsocontributed to clarify and furnish solutions to the problem,Clearly, generation is one of the issues in a machine trans-lation system.
However, work in generation per se usuallypresupposes the existence of an unambiguous 'concept'representation, and so the problems begin with the correctstating of an idea in one particular language.
In thisframework, it is clear that one key concept is that of"collocations", or how lexical items combine in a particularlanguage.In these systems, it is advocated (see for instance \[6\]) thatin the specialized 'semantic" dictionary "storing the possiblelexicalizations of a 'concept" in a given language (...) thepossibility of combining lexemes in collocations" shouldalso be stored, specifically in the entries for the bases(which determine the possible collocates: a collocation is apair base-collocate).A remark of utmost importance can be found in \[11\], dur-ing the description of the D IOGENES generation system:"collocalional relations are defined on lexical units, notmeaning representations".Summing upThe literature survey above supports some of our assump-tions, namely that?
there are problems which are bilingual in nature, andcannot therefore be properly dealt with in only onelanguage;?
there is not a clear distinction between what shouldbe accounted for as an idiom, a metaphorical use ofa word or a collocation.
The boundaries betweencollocational restrictions, metaphorical readings andidioms are blurred and may even not be pertinent othe automatic treatment of language.to translate correctly, it is often necessary to use ex-pressions instead of single words.
Those expressionscan moreover give origin to complex structurechanges, possibly discontinuous.Our approachWe are interested in solving the problem of translating oneexpression into another expression, no matter whether theneed arises because of a lexical gap, a collocation differ-ence or an idiom not literally translatable.Therefore, we treat all these three problems the same way,namely, considering then~ as instances of a contrastive lex-ical transfer problem in the scope of machine translation.We must emphasize that we are only interested inexpression-to-expression translations when tile literal onesare not acceptable.
This stems from the lhct that there is aconsiderable number of fixed expressions which do not re-quire any special processing, as can be seen in the followinglist, with examples taken from several anguages:(E) parents and childrenpals e filhos(E) ladies and gentlemensenhoras e senhores(F) monter la moutarde au nez desubir a mostarda o nariz de(F) attendre un enfantesperar uma crianqa um filho(E) take into accounttomar em conta(I) prendere il toro per le comapegar o touro pelos cornos(E) in good handsem boas mY.osFigure 3.
Literally translatable idioms:F-French, l-ItalianE-English,Our solutionGiven that tile target expressions can be arbitrarily com-plex, we impose no restrictions whatsoever on their \[brmor structure, andg ive  unlimited power to the device in-tended to cope with them.On the other hand, it didn't appeal to us to have to store,for each pair source-targe t ntries, the lull structural trans-formation implied, as in the most powerful approachesmentioned above (cf.
\[101 and 171).
This approach givesorigin to very heavy dictionaries, with a lot of redundancy,moreover, since there may be similar transformations re-peated to many entries.
On the other hand, not only thedictionary becomes very difficult to unde,'stand and modify',(requiring someone who knows the "programming ~ lan-guage used), but also it makes it tightly coupled to thestructural representation andor  particular linguisticformalism and options used in the machine translationsystem, in both analysis and generation.We chose thus a different method that?
allows tbr maximal readabilityis independent of the linguistic (and programming)decisions of file whole h i t  system (being only con-cerned with lexical transfer)* provides as much power as any unrestricted (tree orgraph) transformation languageThe method proposed consists then of u ~ ' p ~as tile result value in tim bilingual dictionary, there-\['ore keeping it independent of whatever structure it shouhtbe assigned, and i n v ~ l a ~ e .
.
d ~ r s e r  thatbuilds the structure required, on the Ily.Another advantage of the process above is that the newstructure is dynamically built onlxwhen it is necessarz (thatis, when it corresponds to tile chosen translation).On the other hand, no separate (and redundant) lexicalrules need be written in the dictionary, as tile very samegrammar is used for all multiword target expressions.
"lhegrammar should be a "twirl" of that used in the analysis332 3phase, that is, it should obey the same formalism and lin-guistic options in order fur them to be compatible.A detailed exampleF'or the sake of clarity, a full example will be presented,regarding the word miss, in its meaning of to feel  sorry orunhappy at the absence or loss of  (someone or something)( l .ongman).
The Iqgure 4 shows an abridged fbrm of theentry for miss in the bilingual dictionary.
The information\[br choosing among the several possible translations wasomitted am1 will not be discussed here.
The examples pre-sented will be in any case those that correctly trigger thetranslat ion sentir a fa l ta  (literally, "feel tile lack").miss(Vl:.RB C I ITPOSS (EVP sentir a falta))miss(VEI,H\] C I ITPOSS (EVP ter saudades))perder0/FA~.B)fa l tar0/E RB)miss(VERB (EVP deixar escapar))men ina(NO UN)Figure 4. l )kt ionary entry for "miss": EVP storesthe Portuguese string to be used as trans-lation.The first thing that should be exemplified, is tbat, after thechoice of  the mulfiword translation, the Portuguese gram-mar  is invoked, building a equivalent graph f iagment o thetranslation of 'Teel the lack".

A simple example.With this simple example, it can be seen that some struc-tural manipulat ion took place (converting the English di-rect object pronoun into a Portuguese possessive adjective- triggered by tim CI I ' IPOSS marker  in Figure 4), and thatthe words taking part in the multiword expression wereconveniently intlected (in this case, only the verb).More complex processing can clearly take place, as is ex-emplified in Figure 6.!
'11 a lways  miss  peop le  i l i ke  .. .

.
.

.
.

.
.
.
> esqueciqne de sentir a tua falta .Figure 6.
Several examples of "miss" translated as"sentir a falta": Complex ter,ses, passive,relative clauses, distinction between thirdperson singular and others, adverb posi-tion, etc.As ter smMades is also a valid translation for miss in thesame context as senti," a fatta, this choice belongs to styletransfer.
Follows the output of the system in that case:i miss that time.. .
.
.
.
.
> eu tenho saudades daquele tempo.Figure 7.
Another style alternative: "miss" trans-lated by "ter saudades".Other problemsIt remains to be shown how tile other problems rnentionedabove are solved in this framework.
We begin by changeof part-of-speech, and continue by identifying source lan-guage (English) multiword expressions, which then com-prehend the remaining cases, namely collocations aridequivalence of distinct idioms.Change of part-of-speechThe change of part-of-speech should be transparent  as fi~ras the dictionary is concerned, being the assignment of thecorrect interpretation performed by the Portuguese parse,'.thank(VERB (NPOS AJP)  ( I )REPO OBJEC I '  a)(EVP obrigada))agradecer(VF, R B (PRE PO tbr por))agradee imento(NOUN (PI~.I'~PO lbr por))obr igado(NOUN)I:igure g. Abbreviated entry for ttm ~ord"thank":  Since the string "Obrigada" hasthree possible interpretations according tothe Portuguese parser, NPOS stores thephrase type to select.Only when there are more than one parse for the targetexpression and the one to choose implies a change ofpart-of-speech needs this to be stored in the bilingual dic-tionary, as can be seen in Figure 8 above.Note: Mori Rimon pointed out to us that in cases of highlyambiguous target languages, as is the case of written4 333l lebrew, the indication of which syntactical alternative,when different from the source one, could be needed veryfrequently, therefore reducing the economy we are assert-ing.
We can only answer that while for English-to-Portuguese translation that structural marking is veryrarely used, further testing with different language pairsmust be done in order to assess or deny the universality ofthis method.
Namely languages whose translation wouldrequire an extensive part-of speech change should betested.Follows a very simple example of the case discussed above:thank you.. .

Change of part-of-speech.This example would be improved if the whole phrase"thank you" were translated by "obrigada", but here wewant to show the simplest case.It should also be mentioned in passing that whenever thereis a generalized part-of-speech change on syntacticalgrounds, that is not done through lexical transfer, but in thestructural transfer, as is the case of adieetival Englishpresent participle clauses.311VE- to-A1 IVE  translationConsidering the general problem of identifying source lan-guage multi word expressions, the philosophy we proposeis similar.
(We are indebted to Stephen Richardson for thissuggestion.)
The implementation is however not yet done,so what will be described in the rest of this chapter is onlya proposal.We consider that source expressions should be identifiedas a bilingual requirement too, and therefore this processshould take place (only if needed) during transfer.
If theidentitication succeeds, the whole phrase would then bereplaced by the corresponding Portuguese translation, beit a word or a complex expression.The next examples illustrate how the bilingual dictionarywould look like:thunder(NOUN (MWE thunder and lightning)(EVP relfimpagos e trov6es))Figure 10.
Collocation differences: The same de-vice used tbr many-to-many translationcan be used when, lbr instance, the ordermust be reversed.kick(VERB (MWE kick the bucket)(EVP bater as botas))Figure !
I.
Example of a many-to-many wordstranslation: The MWE feature corre-sponds both to the context requited inorder to choose that particular trans-lation, and to the piece of English tc~ re-place.Sonic nlunbersIn order to evaluate the interest and need for taking thisproblem into account in machine translation, the followingmeasures were performed, regarding an English-to-Portuguese NIT dictionary roughly containing 500 Englishentries and 2400 Portuguese translations.
Only the case oneEnglish word to several Portuguese words was taken intoaccount.No.
of English entries with EVPs : 80.Total number of EVPs : 152.No.
of verbs translated by EVPs : 60.No.
of nouns translated by EVPs : 47.No.
of adjectives translated by EVPs : 14.No.
of adverbs translated by EVPs : 19.No.
of entries whose first translation is an EVP : 27.No.
of nodes whose correct ranslation is an EVP : 42.Figure 12.
Some relevant numbersIn order to guarantee impartiality of the numbers pre-seuted, the criteria for selecting the English entries, and theactual translations, bore no relationship whatsoever withthe problem mentioned in this paper.The numbers arrived at, however impressive they may be,should nevertheless not be confused with percentages ofoccurrence in actual text.
On tile contrary, there is somerelationship between a rarely used word in one languageand a set of words to express it in another language.I lowever, we still consider that the numbers aboveunequivocally demonstrate hat this problem cannot be ig-nored in any real machine translation system.As for tile actual testing of the proposed method, we rantile system on two test corpora, tile first, regarding tile verb"miss", including several different syntactic environments(see Figure 6), and the second containing several differentinstances of l-to-N translations:3:34 51 stood in the doorway.. .

Several examples of 1-to-N translation.Even though no thorough broad-coverage translation testshave been performed, we believe these results can assessnot only the feasibility but also the flexibility of the methodproposed.ConclusionThe approach presented in this paper handles in the sameway the problems of lexical gaps, collocation requirementsin diil'erent languages, and non-literal translation of idioms.Considering them a bilingual problem, the transfer phasewas assigned as the proper place tbr them to be treated.Ihe method presenled has as advantage minimal storageicquired aml the least COmlmtation (only on demand) ofIhe several strt, ctures involved.
Also, it only makes use ofone single comprehending parser lor the target language,instead of developing particular solutions to particularproblems.lhe  way the dictionary was conceived brings with it con-siderable readability, making it independent of the linguisticand programming formalisms used in the other modulesof the translation system.
Its format can, moreover, makeil very easy to inherit inlbrmation from human-readablebilingual dictionaries.
