Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers,pages 1071?1080, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-29 2014.Argument structure of adverbial derivatives in Russian?Igor BoguslavskyInstitute for Information Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences /19, B.Karetnyj, GSP-4, Moscow, RussiaUniversidad Polit?cnica de Madrid / Facultad de Inform?tica, Campus de Montegancedo,28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, SpainAbstractAdverbial derivatives (AdvD) of nouns of the type v jarosti ?in a rage?, s nasla?deniem ?with pleasure?,pod predlogom ?under the pretext of?
etc.
often inherit the arguments (actants) of the noun they arederived from.
However, as a rule, in case of AdvDs these arguments are realized in a way very differentfrom the nouns.
The main linguistic findings of the paper consist in the set of positions the argumentsmay take with respect to AdvD.
In a general case, a actant slot of an AdvD can be either (a) blocked, or(b) filled by a dependent of the AdvD itself (e.g.
pod predlogom bolezni ?under the pretext of illness?, vdokazatel?stvo svoej nevinovnosti ?as a proof of his innocence?
), or (c) filled by the dominating verb (poprivy?ke prosnulsja rano ?woke up early out of habit?, slushal pesnju s nasla?deniem ?listened to the songwith relish?
), or (d) filled somewhere within the clause organized by the dominating verb; in this case theAdvD argument may be identified based on (d1) its syntactic position (po privy?ke ?by habit?
), or (d2) itssemantic role with respect to its mother element (v podarok ?as a present?
), or (d3) its communicativefunction (v bol?
?instve ?mostly?).
A notation is proposed that permits to present the argument structure ofAdvDs in a compact way.1    IntroductionThis paper is not about computation, it is about linguistics.
It does not describe any electronicresource.
It is not inspired by weaknesses of NLP applications that need to be fixed.
We investigatecertain heavily understudied and even largely unnoticed linguistic phenomena that deserve scientificstudy independently of whether their neglect causes serious errors in today?s NLP applications or not.However, on the other hand, taking these phenomena into account is definitely useful for applications,such as semantic parsing, question answering, recognizing textual entailments, information extraction(e.g.
Meyers et al.
1998), machine reading, machine translation, etc.
Indeed, semantic parsers shouldrepresent the content of the text by means of elementary propositions independently of the syntacticstatus of the main predicate in these propositions, be it a verb, a noun, or an adverbial.
They should beable to understand that such expressions as I believe (that) he is wrong ?
My opinion is (that) he iswrong) ?
In my opinion <to my mind>, he is wrong are different NL realizations of the sameproposition.
Question answering systems should be able to obtain an answer to the question Whathabits does John have?
from the sentence John woke up early out of habit, although the argumentframe of the noun habit does not cover this type of construction (it is the argument frame of theadverbial derivative out of habit that does).
Similarly, textual entailment recognition systems shouldunderstand that John woke up early out of habit entails John has a habit of waking up early, whichagain requires correlating argument frames of three different expressions: the noun habit, the ?supportverb + noun?
combination to have a habit and the adverbial out of habit .Syntactic derivation is one of the most direct manifestations of the systemic character of thelexicon.
As is well-known, language is capable of representing the same meaning (or several veryclose meanings) by means of words belonging to different grammatical classes.
It is often possible toreplace words of a certain grammatical category with those of another grammatical category withoutsignificant modification of their lexical meaning.
For example, the concept ?believe?
can be realisedby means of a verb (to believe) or a noun (opinion) or an adverbial phrase (in my opinion, to my mind).This is one of the important ideas of ?l?ments de syntaxe structurale de Tesni?re (1959).
According toTesni?re, the ability to transfer one category to another at will in fluid speech is the primary tool that?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

This mechanism is an integral part of the linguistic capacityof humans and deserves in-depth study.Lexical resources available to date are not sufficient for that.
First, resources such as WordNet donot establish synonymy relations across category boundaries, and will not recognize these expressionsas synonymous.
Second, the task does not boil down to relating such expressions to the same concept.To reconstruct the proposition, one also needs to find the arguments of all the predicates and identifytheir roles.
The latter task, also known as Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), is fairly well studied for thearguments of the verbs (cf.
CoNLL-2004 and CoNLL-2005 shared tasks on semantic role labeling,Computational Linguistics Special Issue on Semantic Role Labeling, 2008).
Much less is done in SRLof nouns and adjectives (Gerber 2011, Macleod 1997, 1998).
Sometimes, adjectives and prepositionsare included in (verbal and nominal) frames in FrameNet.
However, we are not aware of any attemptto investigate arguments of adverbials.
This category of words is largely understudied.
It is not evenrepresented in WordNet.
In the introductory paper to the Special Issue on Semantic Role Labeling, theSRL task for adverbials is not even mentioned (Marquez et al.
2008).Yet, adverbial derivatives are no less entitled to have arguments than the predicates they arederived from.
If we want to find and identify the arguments of the verb to cause in (1), we would wantto do the same in (2), where this concept is represented by means of the adverbial due to:(1) The minister's interview caused a dramatic fall of the market.
(2) The market fell dramatically due to the minister's interview.However, the problem is that, in a general case, it is more difficult to find these arguments in thesentence than it is for prototypical verbal or nominal predicates.
The positions of these arguments inmay differ greatly from the positions of ?classical?
arguments.The goal of this research is to investigate these non-classical arguments with a view to theiradequate representation in the dictionary and their automatic detection in the text.
We intend to show(a) that the arguments of adverbials need to be found and identified, however non-trivial this task maybe, (b) what their different types are and (c) how the argument structure of adverbial derivatives canbe represented in the dictionary.In this study, we will restrict ourselves to adverbial syntactic derivatives (AdvD) of Russian nounsand verbs.
We will call a syntactic derivative of word L such a word, or phrase, L?
that has the same(or very close) meaning as L, but belongs to a different syntactic category and hence displays adifferent behavior.
We will denote the word L as the basic word, or keyword, of the derivation.
L?
maybe a nominal derivative, or nominalization (to construct - construction, to believe ?
opinion), a verbalderivative (revolution - revolutionize), an adjectival derivative (government ?
governmental), or anadverbial derivative (speed ?
at the speed of, cause ?
due to/because of).The plan of our presentation will be as follows.
In Section 2 we will characterize briefly someproperties of AdvD in Russian, then in Section 3 we will review related work on adverbial derivativeswithin the framework of the Meaning ?
Text theory.
Section 4 will present different types of argumentstructures of adverbial derivatives.
How these structures can be represented in the dictionary will beshown in Section 5.
We will conclude in Section 6.2    Adverbial derivatives in RussianWe will discuss two properties of AdvDs ?
their grammatical status and their semantic load.
From thepoint of view of the grammatical status, there are two types of AdvD in Russian ?
grammatical andlexical ones.
They will be explained in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.
The semantic load of AdvD will becommented upon in Section 2.3.2.1 Grammatical AdvDs (verbal adverbs)Russian has a regular morphological way of constructing AdvDs of verbs ?
verbal adverbs(deeprichastija) that can be derived of virtually any verb.
They serve to express a secondarypredication attached to the main one.
(3) On sprosil eto, gljadja ej v glaza.
?He asked that, looking into her eyes?Russian verbal adverbs are similar to participial constructions in adverbial usage (or gerunds)existing in a variety of languages.
However, they also exhibit significant differences.
An importantpeculiarity of the argument behaviour of Russian verbal adverbs is that their subject cannot be1072expressed in the surface structure and should be co-referential with the subject of the main verb.
Theirother arguments do not have any characteristic properties and are attached to them just as they areattached to the finite form of the verb:(4a) Petr pokupaet ode?du v modnyx magazinax za ogromnye den?gi ?Peter buys clothes in fashionableshops for a lot of money?.
(4b) Pokupaja ode?du v modnyx magazinax za ogromnye den?gi, Petr ve?no po u?i v dolgax ?buyingclothes in fashionable shops for a lot of money, Peter is always in debt up to his neck?.Many languages have absolute constructions, absent in Russian, which allow the subject to beattached to the participle and to be non-coreferential with the subject of the main verb:(5) His wife buying clothes in fashionable shops, Peter is always in debt up to his neck.
(6) Spanish: Habiendo pasado m?s de una hora, las piernas comenzaron a flaquear ?more than anhour having passed, his legs began to fail?.Verbal adverbs may be active, as in (3), or passive, as in (7):(7) Budu?i sorvannym, muxomor prodol?aet rasti ?being plucked, the amanita continues to grow?.It is to be noted that the implicit subject of the passive verbal adverb budu?i sorvannym ?beingplucked?
is the second argument of the active form sorvat?
?pluck?
and, according to the general rule,is co-referential with the subject of the main verb muxomor ?amanita?.2.2 Lexical AdvDsBesides verbal adverbs derived by means of inflection, there is a large number of AdvDs that areexpressed by adverbs (good ?
well, systematic ?
systematically, can - possibly), prepositions (cause ?due to/because of) or prepositional phrases (love ?
with love).
The latter case is the most important,since a large number of AdvDs is formed in this way.
It is to be noted that different AdvDs are formedwith different prepositions.
Semantically, lexical AdvDs are in many cases equivalent to verbaladverbs.
Some examples: ot?ajanie ?dispair?
?
v ot?ajanii ?
(being) in dispair?, interes ?interest?
?
sinteresom ?with interest, feeling interest?, ode?da ?clothes?
?
v ode?de ?being dressed?, bodrstvovat?
?be awake?
?
najavu ?
(being) awake?, obed ?dinner?
?
za obedom ?at dinner?, za?
?ita ?protection?
?
podza?
?itoj ?under protection, being protected?, pomo??
?help?
?
s pomo?
?ju or pri pomo?
?i ?with the helpof, being helped by?.2.3 Pure AdvDs vs. semantically loaded AdvDsOne has to distinguish between two types of AdvD: ?pure?
derivatives, which do not contain anyadditional meaning components absent in the meaning of the basic predicate, and semanticallyenriched derivatives, for which the reverse is true.
As an example of the latter, let us consider thephrase pod imenem X ?under the name of X?
as represented in(8) Napoleon exal pod imenem gerzoga Vi?entskogo, to est?
Kolenkura ?Napoleon was travellingunder the name of duke of Vicenza, that is of Colencour?.The meaning of this sentence contains a component of replacing the true name with another one.Pod imenem X ?under the name of X?
does not mean that the person in question has the name of X, butrather that this person or somebody else wants other people to refer to him/her as X while the speakerknows, believes or admits that this is not the true name.
Obviously, the noun imja ?name?
has no suchcomponent (as opposed to pseudonym or nickname).
It cannot even be ascribed to the preposition pod?under?, either, since in (8) this preposition has obviously the same meaning as in phrases podnazvaniem <zagolovkom, rubrikoj> ?under the title <heading>?
to which the component ofconcealment is completely alien.
Phrases like pod imenem (or its English counterpart under the name)that are to a certain extent idiomatic are lexical units in their own right and have their own entries inthe dictionary.As for ?pure?, non-idiomatic PP AdvDs, they hardly qualify for separate lexical units.
However,irrespective of whether an AdvD is idiomatic or not, it should be supplied with the information aboutits arguments: if a sentence contains the phrase at request, e.g.
I called Mary at the request of myfather, we should be able to answer the question ?Who asked whom to do what??
In this example, weare entitled to infer that speaker?s father asked him/her to call Mary.Note: strictly speaking, the content of father?s request need not necessarily be ?Make a call toMary?.
He could have asked his son/daughter to invite Mary for dinner.
However, the phrase I calledMary at the request of my father is still appropriate provided the act of inviting Mary contains calling1073her as its essential part.In order to be able to make such an inference, one needs to represent the argument structure ofAdvDs fully and unambiguously and relate it to the argument structure of the basic word.As an example of how the correlation between argument structures of different words can beestablished, we can recall the description of converse terms in the theory of Lexical Functions withinthe Meaning ?
Text approach (Mel?uk et al.
1984a, 1984b, 1988, 1992).
Conversives (the input andthe output of the Lexical Function Conv) are a pair of words that denote the same situation but differin the way their arguments are ordered, e.g.
buy ?
sell.
Like any verb, buy and sell are supplied withsubcategorization frames (aka government patterns in the Meaning ?
Text approach) that list all theirarguments and their means of expression.
On the other hand, their being conversives implies that theirlexical functional description should indicate the correlation between their argument structures.Namely, the first argument of sell (?who sells??)
corresponds to the third argument of buy (?fromwhom buys??
), the third argument of sell (?to whom??)
?
to the first argument of buy (?who buys??
),while the second and the fourth arguments (?what??
and ?for how much??)
occupy the same positionswithin government patterns of both verbs.
This correlation is rendered by the numerical index attachedto the Conv symbol: Conv3214(sell) = buy: the j-th position in the index is occupied by i if the j-thargument of the output corresponds to the i-th actant of the input.For AdvDs the problem of the correlation of their argument structure with that of the basicpredicate is particularly acute.
While sell and buy are rightful lexical units entitled to have their owngovernment patterns, adverbial collocations of the type v jarosti ?in anger?, po privy?ke ?by habit?, sakcentom ?with an accent?
or pod predlogom ?under the pretext of?
are not usually treated as separatelexical units.
It is assumed that all necessary information about their meaning and use should beformulated in the lexical entry of the noun.
To what extent does an AdvD inherit the argumentstructure of the noun?
If not in full, how should its argument structure be described in the dictionary?Before answering this question, we will recall how syntactic derivatives, and AdvD in particular,are treated in the theory of lexical functions.3    Syntactic derivatives in the theory of lexical functionsTwo types of syntactic derivation are distinguished: ?zero?
and ?actant?
derivation.
Zero syntacticderivatives (S0, V0, A0 ?
Adv0) have the same meaning as the keyword but belong to a different part ofspeech: S0(investigate)=investigation, V0(investigation)=investigate, A0 (government)=governmental,Adv0 (good)=well.
Actant derivatives (Si, Ai and Advi) are oriented towards one of the actants of thekeyword in the following sense.Si is a standard name of the i-th actant of the keyword (S1(teach) = teacher, S2(teach) = (subject)matter [in high school], S3(teach) = pupil).Ai also has a bearing to the i-th actant, but in the adjectival syntactic status.
This means that itstypical syntactic function is to modify a noun that fills the i-th valence slot of the keyword.
Agrammatical way of expressing Ai is participles.
A1 is equivalent to an active participle, and A2, to apassive participle.
For example, adjectival derivatives of the verb to control are either an activeparticiple controlling (A1) or a prepositional phrase under control (A2); cf.
controlling organizations(?organizations that control something?)
?
operations under control (?operations that are beingcontrolled by someone?
).Things are more complicated with adverbial actant derivatives (Advi).
This function is defined asfollows:?Advi ?
determining property of the action by the i-th ?
actant of L according to its role in thesituation denoted by L. Adv1  is roughly equivalent to an active verbal adverb (?while L-ing?)
andAdv2, to a passive verbal adverb (?while being L-ed?
).Adv2(bombard) = under bombardmentAdv1(speed) = at [a speed of...]?
(Mel?
?uk 1996: 55).As this definition shows, the only link between the actantial structures of the keyword and theadverbial derivative of the Advi type is the i-th actant of the keyword.
Although it is not statedexplicitly, one can presume that the i-th actant?s position in the sentence is the position of the subjectof the verb to which Advi is attached.
In (9) the first actant of anger is obviously Mary, the first actantof the verb reject, and not John or anybody else.
(9) Mary rejected John?s proposal with anger.1074This is understandable, since lexical function Advi is intended to model the behaviour of verbaladverbs and, as mentioned above, they normally correlate strongly with the subject (first actant) of themain predicate (except for the absolute constructions).
However, lexical function Advi  provides noinformation as to the position of other actants of the keyword.
The next section will show that thisinformation is essential for text understanding and that different AdvDs significantly differ in thisrespect.4 Argument structure of adverbial derivativesIf we compare adverbial derivation with other types of syntactic derivation, we will encounter animportant difference.
Argument structure of such derivatives as Convij or Si can be easilycharacterized in terms of the argument structure of the keyword.
When we pass from the keyword tosuch a derivative, we may find that an actant either stays in its initial position (teach mathematics ?teacher of mathematics), or changes its number (the verb dominates the preposition ?
the prepositiondepends on the verb), or gets blocked altogether (drive home - *driver home).
However, the syntacticposition of the actant can only change in a very limited way.
If a valence slot of the keyword isexpressible in the sentence with its Convij or Si at all, the actant should either be attached to thederivative directly, or through a copula or other lexical functional verb (Peter teaches mathematics ?Peter is a teacher of mathematics) or by means of the apposition (Peter, a teacher of mathematics).The matters stand differently with AdvDs.
Their actant properties are much more diverse thanthose of Convij or Si, or even of verbal adverbs.
In some cases, the position of their actants in thesentence cannot be characterized in purely syntactic terms.
In a general case, a valence slot of anAdvD can be either blocked, or:?
filled by a dependent of the AdvD itself;?
filled by the dominating verb;?
filled somewhere within the clause organized by the dominating verb; in this case the  AdvDactant may be identified based on:o its syntactic position;o its semantic role;o its communicative function.We will illustrate all these possibilities below.4.1 Valence slots filled by a dependent of AdvDIn the canonical case, AdvD inherits most of the governing properties of the keyword.
(10a) skorost?
800 km/?as ?a speed of 800 km per hour?,(10b) Samolet letel so skorostju 800 km/?as ?the aircraft was flying at a speed of 800 km per hour?,(11a) sovet Ivana ?Ivan?s advice?,(11b) po sovetu Ivana  ?at Ivan?s advice?,(12a) Eto podarok ot Viktora lit.
?this is a present from Victor?,(12b) Ja polu?il eto v podarok ot brata  lit.
?I got it as a present from my brother?.In some cases, governing properties of AdvD are different from those of the keyword.
Let usconsider the pair predlog ?pretext?
?
pod predlogom ?on/under the pretext of?
that manifests aninteresting correlation of actant properties.
The noun predlog ?pretext?
has three valence slots: P is apretext for X for doing Q = ?wishing to do Q, which violates norms of ethics, or politeness, X usessituation P to do Q; he thinks that P justifies Q?
(Boguslavskaya 2003).
When predlog is used withoutthe preposition pod, it can attach actant Q (= the action carried out) but not P (= false motive).
Thelatter can only be expressed outside the phrase containing predlog:(13a)  Golovnaja bol?
[P]  ?
xoro?ij predlog, ?toby ostat?sja doma [Q] ?headache [P] is a good pretextfor staying at home [Q]?.
(13b) *predlog golovnoj boli [P] ?the pretext of the headache [P]?AdvD pod predlogom has opposite governing properties.
Actant P (= false motive) can now be adependent of AdvD while actant Q (= the action) loses this property and moves to the position of thedominating word:(13c) Ona ostalas?
doma  [Q] pod predlogom golovnoj boli [P] ?she stayed at home [Q] on the pretextof the headache [P]?.10754.2 Valence slots filled by the dominating verbAdverbial derivatives of many predicates which have a propositional valence slot fill it by means ofthe dominating verb.
One example is (13c) above.
In the following examples, the actant at issue isunderlined in both the sentence with the basic predicate, and in the sentence with the AdvD.
(14a) Ljusja dokazala polnuju sda?u svoix pozicij tem, ?to pocelovala Marata v nos ?Ljusja provedcomplete surrender by kissing Marat on the nose?.
(14b) V konce koncov sama Ljusja priznala grubost?
svoego zame?anija i v dokazatel?stvo polnojsda?i svoix pozicij pocelovala Marata v nos ?after all, Ljusja herself acknowledged that her remarkhad been rude, and as a proof of complete surrender kissed Marat on the nose?
(AdvD v dokazatel?stvo?as a proof?).
(15a) On otvetil mnogozna?itel?nym my?aniem ?he responded with a significant mumble?.
(15b) V otvet on ?to-to mnogozna?itel?no promy?al ?in response he mumbled something in asignificant manner?
(AdvD v otvet ?in response?).
(16a) Ja s?itaju, ?to ?dat?
bol?
?e ne?ego ?I think there is nothing more to wait for?.
(16b) Po-moemu, ?dat?
bol?
?e ne?ego ?in my opinion, there is nothing more to wait for?
(AdvD po-moemy ?in my opinion?
).4.3 Valency slots filled by dependents of the dominating verbIf a valency slot of an AdvD is filled by a dependent of the dominating verb, the question arises as tohow to specify its position among other dependents of the verb.
We will show that this position can beidentified based on the syntactic function (4.3.1), semantic role (4.3.2) or communicative function(4.3.3).4.3.1 Syntactic functionAs mentioned in section 2, in the prototypical case of adverbial derivation, that of verbal adverbs, oneof the actants of the keyword (the first or the second) is necessarily co-referential with the first actant(subject) of the dominating verb.
Since this actant is not expressible as a dependent of the AdvD, thesubject of the dominating verb is its only manifestation in the sentence.
In this sense, we can say thatthe valence slot is filled by the subject of the dominating verb.
If it is the first actant of the keywordthat is co-referential with the subject, we are dealing with the active verbal adverb (Adv1, in Mel??uk?sterminology).
If it is the second actant, the verbal adverb (Adv2) is passive.
If the co-referencerequirement is not met, sentences with verbal adverbs are usually ungrammatical in Russian.
Cf.
atextbook example of a wrong use of a verbal adverb *Podjez?aja k stancii, u menja sletela ?ljapa?when approaching the station, my hat fell down?.As for non-verbal AdvDs, this requirement holds for some of them and not for others.
Let usdiscuss one example: the verb privyknut?
?have a habit of?.
It has two valencies ?
?who has the habit?
?and ?what does the habit consist in??.
Its AdvD is po privy?ke ?by habit?.
Although it does not take anysyntactic dependents, sentences with this AdvD provide unambiguous information on who has a habitand what it consists in/ hence, both valencies are filled:(17) Ivan po privy?ke ostavil dver?
otkrytoj ?by habit, Ivan left the door open?The identity of the first actant of po privy?ke and the subject of the main verb can be easilydemonstrated.
Let?s take the verbs zanimat?
?to borrow?
and odal?ivat?
?to lend?.
Being conversives,they denote the same situation and sentences (18a) and (18b) are synonymous:(18a) Ivan zanjal u soseda 1000 rublej ?Ivan borrowed 1000 roubles from the neighbour?
(18b) Sosed odol?il Ivanu 1000 rublej ?the neighbour lent Ivan 1000 roubles?.If AdvD po privy?ke ?by habit?
is introduced in (18a) and (18b) in the same position, the sentenceswill no longer be synonymous.
(19a) refers to the habit of Ivan while (19b) ?
to the habit of theneighbour.
(19a) Po privy?ke Ivan zanjal u soseda 1000 rublej ?by habit Ivan borrowed 1000 roubles from theneighbour?
(19b) Po privy?ke sosed odol?il Ivanu 1000 rublej ?by habit the neighbour lent Ivan 1000 roubles?.4.3.2 Semantic roleAnother type of constraint is manifested by AdvDs v podarok ?as a present?, v dar ?as a gift?, vnagradu ?in reward?.
Nouns of the present / gift / reward type have three valence slots: the agent of1076presenting something (X), the theme (Y) and the recipient (Z).
The AdvDs co-occur with a large set ofverbs concentrated around the meaning of ?transfer?
: polu?at?
?receive?, prinimat?
?accept?, trebovat?
?demand?, prosit?
?request?
; prinosit?
?bring (on foot)?, privozit?
?bring (by transport)?, dostavljat?
?deliver?, posylat?
?send?, otpravljat?
?dispatch?, prednazna?at?
?intend for?, ?alovat?
?grant?, podnosit?
?offer?, predlagat?
?offer?, peredavat?
?pass (to)?, vru?at?
?hand over?, davat?
?give?, otdavat?
?giveback?, etc.
It is impossible to associate the subject of the main verb with any single actant of AdvD,since each of the three actants can perform the role of the subject:(20a) Otec (X) privez do?eri v podarok o?erelje ?Father (X) brought a necklace as a present to hisdaughter?.
(20b) Maria (Z) prinjala o?erelje v podarok ?Mary (Z) accepted the necklace as a present?.
(20c) O?erelje (Y) dostalos?
ej v podarok ot babu?ki  ?the necklace (Y) came to her as a present of hergrandmother?.It is not syntactic constraints that regulate the position of the actants of these AdvD with respect tothe main verb but semantic ones.
The correlation between the valence slots of AdvD and the mainverb can be formulated IN TERMS OF SEMANTIC ROLES as follows: if a valence slot of AdvD whichcorresponds to semantic role R (Agent, Theme, Recipient) is instantiated, it is either filled by an AdvDdependent (as in v podarok do?eri ?as a present to one?s daughter?, v podarok ot otca ?as a presentfrom one?s father?
), or by a dependent of the main verb which performs the role R with respect to thepredicate of transfer within the meaning of the main verb.
For example, in (20a-c) the subjects otec?father?, Maria ?Maria?
and o?erelje ?necklace?
all play different semantic roles with respect to themain verb: the father is the Agent of bringing, Maria is the Recipient of giving (?accept?
?
?agree to begiven?
), and the necklace is the Theme of coming.
Accordingly, these words are the Agent, Recipientand Theme of the present, respectively.It should be stressed that the semantic role of a noun phrase with respect to the dominating verbmay be different from its semantic role with respect to an inner predicate of this verb.
For example, in(21a) Ivan potreboval poltsarstva ?Ivan demanded half of the kingdom?
[= ?demanded that he weregiven half of the kingdom?
]Ivan is the Agent of demanding and at the same time the Recipient of giving.
What is important forAdvD of the v podarok type is the role of the actant with respect to giving.
Therefore, in (21b) Ivan isthe Recipient and not the Agent of reward:(21b) Ivan potreboval sebe v nagradu poltsarstva ?Ivan demanded half of the kingdom as a reward?.4.3.3 Communicative functionBoguslavsky (2005) discussed the argument frames of noun bol?
?instvo ?majority, most of?
andmen?
?instvo ?minority?.
It was shown that these words have three arguments: the whole, a part of thewhole and the property of the part that is shared by most of the elements of the whole.
Here we willonly be interested in one of these arguments ?
that of the whole, expressed prototypically bypreposition iz ?of?
as represented in phrases the majority of cases, most of the students.
In sentenceswith AdvD v bol?
?instve ?mostly, for the most part?
this valence slot is filled, as a rule, by the subjectof the dominating verb:(22) Oni byli arestovany i podverglis?
v bol?
?instve svoem ssylke v Gvianu i na Sej?el?skie ostrova?they were arrested and mostly exiled to Guiana or Seychelles?
[= ?most of them were exiled??
]However, this is not the only possible syntactic role for this actant.
In (23) it is the direct objectinostrannye knigi ?foreign books?
that fills the valence slot of the whole:(23) Russkie knigi byli sobrany pokojnym mu?em knjagini?, inostrannye ?e ?
v bol?
?instve vyvezlasama Anna Arkadjevna iz Pari?a  lit.
?Russian books were collected by the late husband of theprincess?, while foreign books (dir.
object) mostly Anna Arkadjevna brought from Paris herself?
[=?most of the foreign books?
].And even this is not all.
What is essential here is not the syntactic role of the actant but thecommunicative organization of the clause.
The valence slot of the whole should be filled by the Topic.Since the position of the Topic is most often held by the subject, it is clear why it is the subject that forthe most part fills this valence slot.
The claim that the valency of the whole of v bol?
?instve ?mostly?
isTopic-oriented can be confirmed by a  minimal pair of sentences below.Due to the relatively free word order in Russian, the Topic-Focus distinction is rarely markedsyntactically or lexically.
The same syntactic structure may correspond to different Topic-Focus1077articulations.
In most cases it is the clause-initial phrase that is the Topic of the sentence1.
In (24a) and(24b) the syntactic structures are the same but the word order and the Topic-Focus articulation s aredifferent.
Therefore, the valency slot of the whole is filled differently:(24a) ?en?
?iny (Topic) v bol?
?instve svoem sideli v zalelit.
?the women (Topic) in majority were sitting in the hall?
?most of the women were in the hall?
(24b) V zale sideli (Topic)  v bol?
?instve svoem ?en??inylit.
?in the hall were sitting (Topic) in majority the women?
?most of those in the hall were women?5    Representation of adverbial derivatives in the lexiconFrom the viewpoint of the theory of phraseology developed in Mel?
?uk 1995, AdvDs belong to theclass of collocations and should be represented in the dictionary within the entries of their nominalcomponent ?
the keyword of the derivation (Mel?
?uk 1995: 184).
The entries of the keywords containall the information on their argument frames.
Based on this information, one can represent theargument frame of AdvD in a compact way.AdvD are to be described in the dictionary entry of the keyword, as a value of the Adv LexicalFunction.
The argument structure of the derivative is described by means of an index attached to theAdv symbol.
We showed above (in 2.3) how the correlation between the arguments of the conversivescan be stated by means of the numerical index attached to the symbol of the Conv Lexical Function.We are going to describe AdvDs along similar lines, but the index should be somewhat moreelaborated.
Namely, the argument index of the Lexical Function Adv is constructed as follows:?
it consists of n positions, according to the number of valency slots of the keyword; the 1stposition corresponds to the 1st slot of the keyword, the 2nd position corresponds to the 2nd slotetc.?
each position contains information on whether the corresponding valency can be filled if thekeyword is represented by its adverbial derivative and, if so, how it should be filled.
Thisinformation is one of the following:o 0, if the slot cannot be filled,o i, if the slot is filled as the i-th slot of the keyword,o G, if the slot is filled by the syntactic governor of the AdvD,o i(G), if the slot is filled by a phrase that is the i-th actant of the syntactic governor ofAdvD or has semantic role i with respect to this governor,o Topic, if the slot is filled by the Topic of the clause to which belongs AdvD.Let us show how the properties of AdvDs of different types can be represented using this notation.Each illustration consists of three parts: (a) the keyword and its argument frame, (b) an examplecontaining AdvD, (c) representation of the argument frame of AdvD with a short comment.
(25a) skorost?
?speed?
(?what has the speed?
?, ?the value of the speed?
)(25b) Avtomobil?
m?alsja so skorostju 200 km/?as ?the car moved at the speed of 200 km/hour?
(25c)  so skorostju ?at the speed of?
= AdvG,2 [the 1st argument is the syntactic governor of AdvD(?moved?
), and the 2nd is the 2nd argument of the keyword](26a)  jarost?
?rage?
(?who is in the state of rage?
?, ?what was the cause of this state??
)(26b) On v jarosti razorval pis?mo na klo?ki ?in a rage, he tore the letter to pieces?.
(26c) v jarosti ?in a rage?
= Adv1(G),0 [the 1st argument is the 1st argument (?he?)
of the syntacticgovernor (?tore?
), the 2nd argument cannot be realized with AdvD](27a) nasla?denie ?relish, enjoyment?
(?who enjoys?
?, ?what does one enjoy??
)(27b) On s nasla?deniem vykuril sigaru ?he smoked a cigar with relish?.
(27c) s nasla?deniem ?with relish?
= Adv1(G),G [the 1st argument is the 1st argument (?he?)
of thesyntactic governor (?smoked?
), the 2nd argument is the syntactic governor itself.
Note the importantdifference between (26c) and (27c): in case of ?with relish?
the main predicate refers to the source ofthe emotional state: smoking a cigar is what made him feel relish; in (26b) the reason of feeling rage isnot specified.
This difference is reflected in different indices](28a) somnenije ?doubt?
(?who doubts?
?, ?what does one doubt??)???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
?1 Of course, this is a simplification, the reality is more complicated, but this is a general rule.1078(28b) Ona vrjad li pridet ?she will hardly come?
(28c) vrjad li ?hardly, unlikely?
= Adv0,G [the 1st argument cannot be realized with AdvD, the 2nd isexpressed by the syntactic governor](29a)  podarok ?a present?
(?who gives?
?, ?what is given?
?, ?to whom??
)(29b)  Otec privjoz Marii v podarok o?erelje ?Father brought Maria a necklace as a present?.
(29c)  v podarok ?as a present?
= AdvG(Agent),G(Theme),G(Recipient) [in (29b) all the three argument slots ofAdvD are filled by the corresponding arguments of the predicate of transfer ?
prvjoz ?brought?
](30a)  bol'?instvo ?majority?
(?what constitutes the majority?
?, ?what is the whole??
)(30b)  V zale sideli v bol?
?instve svoem ?en?
?iny lit.
?in the hall were sitting (Topic) the women?
?most of those in the hall were women?
(30c)  v bol?
?instve ?mostly?
= Adv0,Topic [this AdvD is topic-sensitive; in (30b) the Topic is ?thosewho were in the hall?, therefore it is this meaning that fill the valency of the whole].6    ConclusionThe data presented above show that the argument frames of the adverbial derivatives of predicates aremuch more diverse than it was believed before.
The number of the arguments and their roles aremotivated by the semantics of the predicate they are derived from, but their syntactic realization islargely different.
We showed a variety of syntactic, semantic and communicative positions thearguments of adverbial derivatives may take and how these positions can be described in thedictionary in a compact way.
This information is needed in many semantics-related tasks but is notavailable in any of the existing lexicographic resources.
We proposed a way to represent thisinformation in the lexicon in a compact way.
Supplied with this information, the lexicon will be ableto support the extraction of propositions for a variety of applications2.References.Olga Boguslavskaya.
