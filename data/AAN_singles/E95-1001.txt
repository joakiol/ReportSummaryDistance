On Reason ing  wi th  Ambigu i t iesUwe ReyleInstitute for Computational LinguisticsUniversity of StuttgartAzenbergstr.12, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germanye-mail: uwe@ims.uni-stuttgart.deAbstractThe paper adresses the problem of reasoning withambiguities.
Semantic representations are presentedthat leave scope relations between quantifiers and/orother operators unspecified.
Truth conditions areprovided for these representations and different con-sequence relations are judged on the basis of intuitivecorrectness.
Finally inference patterns are presentedthat operate directly on these underspecified struc-tures, i.e.
do not rely on any translation into the setof their disambiguations.1 IntroductionWhenever we hear a sentence or read a text we buildup mental representations i  which some aspects ofthe meaning of the sentence or text are left underspe-cified.
And if we accept what we have heard or readas true, then we will use these underspecified repre-sentations as premisses for arguments.
The challengeis, therefore, to equip underspecified semantic repre-sentations with well-defined truth conditions and toformulate inference patterns for these representati-ons that follow the arguments that we judge as in-tuitively correct.
Several proposals exist for the de-finition of the language, but only very few authorshave addressed the problem of defining a logic ofambiguous reasoning.\[8\] considers lexical ambiguities and investigatesstructural properties of a number of consequence r -lations based on an abstract notion of coherency.
Itis not clear, however, how this approach could beextended to other kinds of ambiguities, especiallyquantifier scope ambiguities and ambiguities trigge-red by plural NPs.
\[1\], \[7\] and \[6\] deal with ambigui-ties of the latter kind.
They give construction rulesand define truth conditions according to which anunderspecified representation f an ambiguous ent-ence is true if one of its disambiguations is.
The pro-blem of reasoning is adressed only in \[5\] and \[7\].
\[5\]'sinference schemata yield a very weak logic only; and\[7\]'s deductive component is too strong.
Being weakand strong depends of course on the underlying con-sequence relation.
Neither \[5\] nor \[7\] make any att-empt to systematically derive the consequence r la-tion that holds for reasoning with ambiguities on thebasis of an empirical discussion of intuitively validarguments.The present paper starts out with such a discussionin Section 2.
Section 3 gives a brief introduction tothe theory of UDRSs.
It gives a sketch of the princip-les to construct UDRSs and shows how scope ambi-guities of quantifiers and negation are represented inan underspecified way.
As the rules of inference pre-sented in \[7\] turn out to be sound also with respectto the consequence r lation defined in Section 2 the-se rules (for the fragment without disjunction) willbe discussed only briefly in Section 4.
The changein the deduction system that is imposed by the newconsequence r lation comes with the rules of proof.Section 5 shows that it is no longer possible to userules like Conditionalisation or Reductio ad Absur-dum when we deal with real ambiguities in the goal.An alternative set of rules is presented in Section 6.2 Consequence RelationsIn this section we will discuss some sample argu-ments containing ambiguous expressions in the dataas well as in the goal.
We consider three kinds of am-biguities: lexical ambiguities, quantifier scope ambi-guities, and ambiguities with respect o distributi-ve/collective readings of plural noun phrases.
Thediscussion of the arguments will show that the mea-ning of ambiguous entences not only depends onthe set of its disambiguations.
Their meanings al-so depend on the context, especially on other oc-currences of ambiguities.
Each disambiguation of anambiguous entence may be correlated to disambi-guations of other ambiguous entences such that thechoice of the first disambiguation also determines thechoice of the latter ones, and vice versa.
Thus the re-presentation of ambiguities requires ome means toimplement these correlations.To see that this is indeed the case let us start discus-sing some consequence r lations that come to mindwhen dealing with ambiguous reasoning.
The firstone we will consider is the one that allows to derivea(n ambiguous) conclusion 7 from a set of (ambi-guous) premisses F if some disambiguation of 7 fol-lows from all readings of F. Assuming that 5 and 5~are operators mapping a set of ambiguous represen-tations a onto one of its disambiguations a ~ or a ~'we may represent this by.
(1) v~3~'(r ~p ? '
) .Obviously (1) is the relation we get if we interpretambiguities as being equivalent to the disjunctions oftheir readings.
To interpret ambiguities in this wayis, however, not correct.
For ambiguities in the goalthis is witnessed by (2).
(2) ~ Everybody slept or everybody didnlt sleep.Intuitively (2) is contingent, but would - accordingto the relation in (1) - be classified as a tautology.In this case the consequence r lation in (3) gives thecorrect result and therefore seems to be preferable.
(3) v v l(r p ?
')But there is another problem with (3).
It does notfulfill Reflexivity, which (1) does.Ref lex iv i ty  F ~ ?, if ?
e FTo do justice to both, the examples in (2) and Refle-xivity, we would have to interpret ambiguous ent-ences in the data also as conjunctions of their rea-dings, i.e.
accept (4) as consequence r lation.
(4) 35'3~(r ~~ 7 ~')But this again contradicts intuitions.
(4) would sup-port the inferences in (5), which are intuitively notcorrect.a.
There is a big plant in front of my house.
(5) ~ There is a big building in front of my house.b.
Everybody didn't sleep.
~ Everybody was awake.c.
Three boys got ?10.
~ Three boys got ?10 each.Given the examples in (5) we are back to (1) and maythink that ambiguities in the data are interpreted asdisjunctions of their readings.
But irrespective of theincompatibility with Reflexivity this picture cannotbe correct either, because it distroys the intuitivelyvalid inference in (6).
(6) If the students get ?10 then they buy books.The students get ?10.
~ They buy books.This example shows that disambiguation is not anoperation 5 that takes (a set of) isolated sentences.Ambiguous sentences of the same type have to bedisambiguated simultaneously.
1 Thus the meaning of1We will not give a classification or definition of am-biguities of the same type here.
Three major classes willconsist of lexical ambiguities, ambiguities with respectto distributive/collective readings of plural noun phra-ses, and quantifier scope ambiguities.
As regards the lasttype we assume on the one hand that only sentenceswith the same argument structure and the same set ofreadings can be of the same type.
More precisely, if twosentences are of the same type with respect o quanti-fier scope ambiguities, then the labels of their UDRS'sthe premise of (6) is given by (7b) not by (7a), whereal represents the first and a2 the second reading ofthe second sentence of (6).a.
((al b) V (a2 b)) ^  V(7) b.
((al -+ b) A el) V ((a2 --+ b) A a2)We will call sentence representations that have tobe disambiguated simultaneously correlated ambi-guities.
The correlation may be expressed by coinde-xing.
Any disambiguation ~ that simultaneously di-sambiguates a set of representations coindexed withi is a disambiguation that respects i, in symbols ~.
Adisambiguation ~i that respects all indices of a givenset I is said to respect I, written ~.
Let I be a setof indices, then the consequence r lation we assumeto underly ambiguous reasoning is given in (8)(s) pThe general picture we will follow in this paper is thefollowing.
We assume that a set of representations Frepresents the mental state of a reasoning agent R.r contains underspecified representations.
Correlati-ons between elements of r indicate that they sharepossible ways of disambiguation.
Suppose V is onlyimplicitly contained in r .
Then R may infer it fromF and make it explicit by adding it to its mentalstate.
This process determines the consequence r la-tion relative to which we develop our inference pat-terns.
That means we do not consider the case whereR is asked some query 7 by another person B. Theadditional problem in this case consists in the arrayof possibilities to establish correlations between B'squery and R's data, and must be adressed within aproper theory of dialogue.Consider the following examples.
The data containstwo clauses.
The first one is ambiguous, but not inthe context of the second.a.
Every pitcher was broken.
They had lost.Every pitcher was broken.b.
Everybody didn't sleep.
John was awake.
(9) ~ Everybody didn't sleep.c.
John and Mary bought a house.It was completely delapidated.John and Mary bought a house.If the inference is now seen as the result of R's taskto make the first sentence xplicit (which of courseis trivial here), then the goal will not be ambiguous,because it simply is another occurrence of the repre-sentation in the data, and, therefore, will carry thesame correlation index.
In the second case, i.e.
thecase where the goal results from R's processing someexternal input, there is no guarantee for such a cor-relation.
R might consider the goal as ambiguous,and hence will not accept it as a consequence.
(Bmight after all have had in mind just that readingof the sentence that is not part of R's knowledge.
)must be ordered isomorphically.
On the other hand twosentences may carry an ambiguity of the same type ifone results from the other by applying Detachment to auniversally quantified NP (see Section 4).2We will distinguish between these two situations byrequiring the provability relation to respect indices.The rule of direct proof will then be an instance ofReflexivity: F t- 7i if ~'i E F.3 A short introduct ion to UDRSsThe base for unscoped representations proposed in\[7\] is the separation of information about the struc-ture of a particular semantic form and of the contentof the information bits the semantic form combines.In case the semantic form is given by a DRS its struc-ture is given by the hierarchy of subDRSs, that is de-termined by ==v, -% V and (>.
We will represent thishierarchy explicitly by the subordination relation <.The semantic ontent of a DRS consists of the set ofits discourse referents and its conditions.
To be moreprecise, we express the structural information by alanguage with one predicate _< that relates individu-al constants l, called labels.
The constants are namesfor DRS's.
< corresponds to the subordination rela-tion between them, i.e.
the set of labels with < is aupper semilattice with one-element (denoted by/7-).Let us consider the DRSs (11) and (12) representingthe two readings of (10).
(10) Everybody didn't pay attention.
(11) I hum:n(x) \] =~ \] .~\[x pay attention\] I I(12) -, hum:n(x) I =*z I x pay attention \] \]The following representations make the distinctionbetween structure and content more explicit.
Thesubordination relation <_ is read from bottom to top.
(13) 1 hum:n(x) I=?~JIx pay attention\] Ix pay attention 1Having achieved this separation we are able to re-present he structure that is common to both, (11)and (12), by (14).human(x) =~Ix ~)ay att.
I(14) is already the UDRS that represents (10) withscope relationships left unresolved.
We call the no-des of such graphs UDRS-components.
Each UDRS-component consists of a labelled DRS and two func-tions scope and res, which map labels of UDRS-components o the labels of their scope and restric-tor, respectively.
DRS-conditions are of the form(Q, l~1, l~2), with quantifier Q, restrictor//1 and scopeli2, of the form lil~li2, or of the form li:-~lil.
AUDRS is a set of UDRS-components ogether witha partial order ORD of its labels.If we make (some) labels explicit we may represent(14) as in (15).If ORD in (15) is given as {12 <_ scope(ll),13 <_scope(12)} then (15) is equivalent o (11), and incase ORD is {11 _< scope(12), 13 <_ scope(ll)} we geta description of (12).
If ORD is {13 _< scope(ll), 13 <_scope(12)} then (15) represents (14), because it onlycontains the information common to both, (11) and(12).In any case ORD lists only the subordination re-lations that are neither implicitly contained in thepartial order nor determined by complex UDRS-conditions.
This means that (15) implicitly containsthe information that, e.g., res(/2) < lT, and also thatres(/2) ~ 12, res(ll) ~_ lT and scope(ll) ~ lT.In this paper we consider the fragment of UDRSs wi-thout disjunction.
For reason of space we cannot con-sider problems that arise when indefinites occurringin subordinate clauses are interpreted specifically.
2We will, therefore assume that indefinites behave li-ke generalized quantifers in that their scope is clausebounded too, i.e.
require l<_l' for all i in clause (ii.c)of the following definition.Def in i t ion 1:(i) (I:<UK,C K U C~>,res(1), scope(l),ORDt) is aUDRS-component, if (UK, CSK) is a DRS containingstandard DRS-conditions only, and C~: is one of thefollowing sets of labelled DRS-conditions, where//1and/(2 are standard DRSs, Qx is a generalized quan-tification over x, and l' is the upper bound of a (sub-ordinate) UDRS-clause (l':(7o,...,Tn),ORD~) (defi-ned below).
(a) {}, or {sub(l')}(b) {l 1 ::~/2, ll :K1,/2:1(2}, or{ll ~ 12,11 :K1, /2 :K2,11 :sub(l') }(c) {(Off1,/2), l, :K1,/2:K2}, or{(Q, 11,12), ll.
'Ki, 12K2, ll :sub(l') } } 3(d) ,{",l,, l, :K1}If C~ ?
{} then 11 ~ /2, (Qzll,/2), or -~11 is calleddistinguished condition of K, referred to by l:7.res and scope are functions on the set of labels, andORDt is a partial order of labels, res(l), scope(l),and ORDt are subject o the following restrictions:~These problems axe discussed extensively in \[7\] andthe solution given there can be taken over to the rulespresented here.3Whenever convenient we will simply use implicativeconditions of the form ll =:~ /2, to represent universallyquantified NPs (instead of their generalized quantifierrepresentation (every, 11, /2) ).3(a) (a) If-~11E C~:, thenres(l) = scope(1) = 11 and l l<l E ORDI.
4(f~) If (~ ,  11,12)E C~:, or Q~ll, 12E C~, thenres(1) = 11, scope(1) = 12, and ll<l, 12<l,11~12 C ORDt.
(5') Otherwise res(1) -- scope(l) = l(b) If k:sub(l~)E C~, then l'<k E ORDz andORD~, c ORD~.
(ii) A UDRS-clause is a pair (l:(~0, ...,'Yn), ORDt),where 7~ -~ (l i :Ki,res(l i) ,scope(l i),ORDl,), 0 <_ i_< n, are UDRS components, and ORDl contains allof the conditions in (a) to (c) and an arbitrary subsetoif those in (d) and (e).

I is calledupper bound and/0 lower bound of the UDRS-clause.Lower bounds neither have distinguished conditionsnor is there an/I such that l ~<l.
(iii) A UDRS-database is a set of UDRSs((/iT:F, ORDl~))i.
A UDRS-goal is a UDRS.For the fragment of this paper UDRS-componentsthat contain distinguished conditions do not containanything else, i.e.
they consist of labelled DRSs Kfor which UK = C~ = {) if C~: ~ {).
We assumethat semantic values of verbs are associated withlower bounds of UDRS-clauses and NP-meaningswith their other components.
Then the definition ofUDRSs ensures that 5(i) the verb is in the scope of each of its arguments,(clause (ii.b)),(ii) the scope of proper quantifiers is clause boun-ded, (clause (ii.c))For relative clauses the upper bound label l ~ is sub-ordinated to the label I of its head noun (i.e.
therestrictor of the NP containing the relative) by l'<l(see (ii)).
In the case of conditionals the upper boundlabel of subordinate clauses is set equal to the la-bel of the antecedent/consequent of the implicati-ve condition.
The ordering of the set of labels of aUDRS builds an upper-semilattice with one-elementIT.
We assume that databases are constructed out ofsequences $1, ..., S~ of sentences.
Having a uniqueone-element / r associated with each UDRS repre-senting a sentence Si is to prevent any quantifier ofSi to have scope over (parts of) any other sentence.4Wedef inel<l '  := l< l  IA l?
l  t.5For the construction of underspecified representati-ons see \[2\], this volume.4 Ru les  of  In fe renceThe four inference rules needed for the fragment wi-thout generalized quantifiers 6 and disjunction arenon-empty universe (NeU), detachment (DET), am-biguity introduction (AI), and ambiguity eliminati-on (DIFF).
NeU allows to add any finite collectionof discourse referents to a DRS universe.
It reflectsthe assumption that there is of necessity one thing,i.e.
that we consider only models with non-emptyuniverses.
DET is a generalization of modus ponens.It allows to add (a variant of) the consequent of animplication (or the scope of a universally quantifiedcondition) to the DRS in which the condition occursif the antecedent (restrictor) can be mapped to thisDRS.
AI allows one to add an ambiguous represen-tation to the data, if the data already contains allof its disambiguations.
And an application of DIFFreduces the set of readings of an underspecified re-presentation i  the presence of negations of someof its readings.
The formulations of NeU, DET andDIFF needed for the consequence r lation (8) defi-ned in Section 2 of this paper are just refinements ofthe formulations needed for the consequence r lation(1).
As the latter case isextensively discussed in \[7\]and a precise and complete formulation of the rulesis also given there we will restrict ourselves to therefinements needed to adapt these rules to the newconsequence r lation.As there is nothing more to mention about NeU westart with DET.
We first present a formulation ofDET for DRSs.
It is an extended formulation of stan-dard DET as it allows for applications not only atthe top level of a DRS but at levels of any depth.Correctness of this extension is shown in \[4\].DET  Suppose a DRS K contains a condition of theform K1 ::~ K2 such that K1 may be embeddedinto K by a function f, where K is the merge ofall the DRSs to which K is subordinate.
Thenwe may add K~ to K, where K~ results fromK2 by replacing all occurrences of discourse re-ferents of UK2 by new ones and the discoursereferents x declared in UK1 by f(x).We will generalize DET to UDRSs such that thestructure that results from an application of DETto a UDRS is again a UDRS, i.e.
directly representssome natural language sentence.
We, therefore, in-corporate the task of what is usually done by a ruleof thinning into the formulation of DET itself andalso into the following definition of embedding.
Wedefine an embedding f of a UDRS into a UDRS to bea function that maps labels to labels and discoursereferents to discourse referents while preserving allconditions in which they occur.
We assume that f isone-to-one when f is restricted to the set of discour-6We will use implicative conditions of the form(=}, 11, 12), to represent universally quantified NPs (in-stead of their generalized quantifier representation(every, Zl, 12)).4se referents occurring in proper sub-universes.
Onlydiscourse referents occurring in the universe associa-ted with 1T may be identified by f. We do not assumethat the restriction of f to the set of labels is one-to-one also.
But f must preserve -~, :=> and V, i.e.respect he following restrictions.
(i) if l:~(ll,12) occurs in K', then f(/)::=~(f(ll),f(12)),(ii) if l:-~ll occurs in K', then f(/):-~f(ll).For the formulation of the deduction rules it is con-venient o introduce the following abbreviation.
Let\]C be a UDRS and l some of its labels.
Then \]Ct isthe sub-UDRS of )~ dominated by l, i.e.
Kz containsall conditions l':~ such that l'<_l and its ordering re-lation is the restriction of \]C's ordering relation.Suppose 7 = lo:ll==>12 is the distinguished conditi-on of a UDRS component l:K occurring in a UDRSclause \]Ci of a UDRS K:.
And suppose there is anembedding f of \]G1 into a set of conditions ?
:5 of \]Csuch that l <: ?.
Then the result of an applicationof DET to 7 is a clause \]~ that is obtained from\]Cl by (i) eliminating/C h from K:l (ii) replacing alloccurrences of discourse referents in the remainingstructure by new ones and the discourse referents xdeclared in the universe of / i ,  by f(x); (iii) substitu-ting l' for l, /1, and /2 in ORDt; and (iv) replacingall other labels of K:l by new ones.But note that applications of DET are restricted toNPs that occur 'in the context of' implicative condi-tions, or monotone increasing quantifiers, as shownin (16).
Suppose we know that John is a politician,then:(16)Few problems preoccupy every politician.t/Few problems preoccupy John.Every politician didn't sleep.~/John didn't sleep.At least one problem preoccupies every pol.
}- At least one problem preoccupies John.
(16) shows that DET may only be applied to a con-dition 7 occurring in l:K, if there is no componentl':K I such that the distinguished condition l':7' ofK '  is either a monotone decreasing quantifier or anegation, and such that for some disambiguation ofthe clause in which 7 occurs we get l <_ scope(l').As the negation of a monotone decreasing quantifieris monotone increasing and two negations neutralizeeach other the easiest way to implement the restric-tion is to assign polarities to UDRS components andrestrict applications of DET to components with po-sitive polarity as follows.Suppose l:K occurs in a UDRS clause(/0:(7o,...,Tn),ORDzo), where l0 has positive pola-rity, written lo +.
Then l has positive (negative) pola-rity if for each disambiguation the cardinality of theset of monotone decreasing components (i.e.
mono-tone decreasing quantifiers or negations) that takeswide scope over l is even (odd).
Negative polarityof l0 is induces the complementary distribution ofpolarity marking for l. If l is the label of a com-plex condition, then the polarity of l determines thepolarity of the arguments of this condition accor-ding to the following patterns: l+ : l -~ ,  l - :~12- ,/+ : -~ ,  and l - : -~ ,  l~ has positive polarity for everyi.
The polarity of the upper bound label of a UDRS-clause is inherited from the polarity of the label theUDRS-clause is attached to.
Verbs, i.e.
lower boundsof UDRS-clauses, always have definite polarities ifthe upper bound label of the same clause has.Two remarks are in order before we come to the for-mulation of DET.
First, the polarity distribution canbe done without explicitly calculating all disambi-guations.
The label l of a component l:K is positive(negative) in the clause in which occurs, if the setof components on the path to the upper bound la-bel l + of this clause contains an even (odd) numberof polarity changing elements, and all other com-ponents of the clause (i.e.
those occurring on otherpaths) do not change polarity.
Second, the fragmentof UDRSs we are considering in this paper does notcontain a treatment of n-ary quantifiers.
Especial-ly we do not deal with resumptive quantifiers, like<no boy, no girl> in No boy  likes no girl.
If wedo not consider the fact that this sentence may beread as No boy  likes any girl  the polarity mar-king defined above will mark the label of the verb aspositive.
But if we take this reading into account, i.e.allow to construe the two quantified NPs as constitu-ents of the resumptive quantifier, then one negationis cancelled and the label of the verb cannot get adefinite value.
7To represent DET schematically wewrite (IT:a(F:7),ORD) to indicate that i~:K is acomponent of the UDRS K:IT with polarity 7r anddistinguished condition 7.A (lT:a(~:~ ~ ~),ORD)  f : /Q , ,  ~-+ A existsThe scheme for DET allows the arguments of theimplicative condition to which it is applied still to beambiguous.
The discussion of example (6) in Section2 focussed on the ambiguity of its antecedent only.
(We ignored the ambiguity of the consequent there.
)To discuss the case of ambiguous consequents weconsider the the following argument.
(17)If the chairman talks, everybody doesn't sleep.The chairman talks.
~- Everybody doesn't sleep.There is a crucial difference between (17) and (6):The truth of the conclusion in (17) depends on thefact that it is derived from the conditional.
It, the-refore, must be treated as correlated with the conse-quent of the conditional under any disambiguation.No non-correlated disambiguations are allowed.
Toensure this we must have some means to represent7A general treatment of n-ary quantification withinthe theory of UDRSs has still to be worked out.
In \[6\] itis shown how cumulative quantification may be treatedusing identification of labels.5the 'history' of the clauses that are added to a set ofdata.
As (8) suggests this could be done by coinde-xing K:l,1 and/Cf(ln) in the representation f (17).In contrast o the obligatory coindexing in the ca-se of (17) the consequence r lation in (8) does allowfor non-correlated interpretations in the case of (2).Such interpretations aturally occur if, e.g., the con-ditional and the minor premiss were introduced byvery distinct parts of a text from which the databa-se had been constructed.
In such cases the interpre-ter may assume that the contexts in which the twosentences occurred are independent of each other.He, therefore, leaves leeway for the possibility that(later on) each context could be provided with moreinformation in such a way that those interpretationstrigger different disambiguations of the two occur-rences.
In such cases "crossed interpretations" mustbe allowed, and any application of DET must berefused by contraindexing - except the crossed in-terpretations can be shown to be equivalent.
For thesake of readability we present he rule only for thepropositional case.A oq =~ fl.i o~k i = k V (i # k A A F- c~i 4:~ c~k)atBut the interpreter could also adopt the strategy toaccept the argument also in case of non-correlatedinterpretations without checking the validity of a i?*ak.
In this case he will conclude that fit holds un-der the proviso that he might revise this inferenceif there will be additional information that forceshim to disambiguate in a non-correlated way.
If thenai 4:~ ak does not hold he must be able to give upthe conclusion nit and every other argument hatwas based on it.
To accomodate this strategy weneed more than just coindexing.
We need means torepresent the structure of whole proofs.
As we ha-ve labels available in our language we may do thisby adopting the techniques of labelled deductive sy-stems (\[3\]).
For reasons of space we will not go intothis in further detail.The next inference rule, AI, allows one to introduceambiguities.
It contrasts with the standard rule ofdisjunction introduction in that it allows for the in-troduction of a UDRS a that is underspecified withrespect o the two readings al and a2 only if both,al and as, are contained in the data.
This showsonce more that ambiguities are not treated as dis-junctions.Ambigu i t iy  In t roduct ion  Let or1 and a2 be twoUDRSs of A that differ only w.r.t, their ORDs.Then we may add a UDRS a3 to A that is likeal but has the intersection of ORD and ORD ~as ordering of its labels.
The index of aa is newto A.We give an example to show how AI and DET inter-act in the case of non-correlated readings: Supposethe data A consists of a~, 0"2 and a3 ~ % We wantto derive 3'.
We apply AI to al and 62 and add au toA.
As the index of a3 is new we must check whethera l  ~=> a2 can be derived from A.
Because A containsboth of them the proof succeeds.The last rule of inference, DIFF, eliminates ambi-guities on the basis of structural differences in theordering relations.
Suppose ~1 and c~2 are a under-specified representations with three scope bearingcomponents 11, 12, and 13.
Assume further that alhas readings that correspond to the following ordersof these components: (h, /2, 11), (h, h, ll), and (h,ll, /3), whereas a2 is ambiguous between (/2, /3, /1)and (/2, ll, /3).
Suppose now that the data containsal  and the negation of a2.
Then this set of datais equivalentto the reading given by (/3, /2, 11).
Tosee that this holds the structural difference betweenthe structures ORD,~ and ORD~ has to be calcu-lated.
The structural difference between two struc-tures ORD~ and ORDa2 is the partial order thatsatisfies ORD~ but not ORD~2, if there is any; andit is falsity if there is no such order.
Thus the noti-on of structural difference generalizes the traditionalnotion of inconsistency.
Again a precise formulationof DIFF is given in \[7\].5 Ru les  of  P roo fRules of proof are deduction rules that allow us toreduce the complexity of the goal by accomplishing/~ subproof.
We will consider COND(itionalization)and R(eductio)A(d)A(bsurdum) and show that theymay not be applied in the case of ambiguous goals(i.e.
goals in which no operator has widest scope).Suppose we want to derive everybody  d idn ' t  sno-re from everybody  d idn ' t  s leep and the factthat snoring implies sleeping.
I.e.
we want to car-ry out the proof in (18), where ORD = {13 <scope(ll), 13 ~ scope(12), 15 <_ scope(14)} and ORIY= {Is < scope(17), Is < scope(16)}.
(IT : (14 : X snore , 15 : ~-~P-~, ORD),8 oRo ,(18)Let us try to apply rules of proof to reduce the com-plexity of the goal.
We use the extensions of CONDand RAA given in \[7\].
There use is quite simple.An application of COND to the goal in (18) resultsin adding <IT:\] a I, { }) to the data and leaves(/tc:(lT:q q , l s :~  }, ORD" ) to be shown, whe-re ORIY' results from ORIY by replacing 16 andscope(16) with l~-.
RAA is now applicable to thenew goal in a standard way.
It should be clear, ho-wever, that the order of application we have cho-6sen, i.e.
COND before RAA, results in having giventhe universal quantifier wide scope over the negati-on.
This means that after having applied COND weare not in the process of proving the original ambi-guous goal any more.
What we are going to proveinstead is that reading of the goal with universalquantifier having wide scope over the negation.
Be-ginning with RAA instead of COND assigns the ne-gation wide scope over the quantifier, as we wouldadd ( l~r : ( l~: \ [~  ~,  I s :~) ,ORD") to  thedata in order to derive a contradiction, s Here ORlY'results from ORU by replacing 17 and scope(17) withl~-.If we tried to keep the reduction-of-the-goal strategywe would have to perform the disambiguation stepsto formulas in the data that the order of applica-tion on COND and RAA triggers.
And in additionwe would have to check all possible orders, not onlyone.
Hence we would perform exactly the same set ofproofs that would be needed if we represented ambi-guous sentences by sets of formulas.
Nothing wouldhave been gained with respect o any traditional ap-proach.We thus conclude that applications of COND andRAA are only possible if either =v or -, has widescope in the goal.
In this case standard formulati-ons of COND and RAA may be applied even if thegoal is ambiguous at some lower level of structure.In case the underspecification ccurs with respectto the relative scope of immediate daughters of 1T,however, we must find some other means to rela-te non-identical UDRSs in goal and data.
What weneed are rules for UDRSs that generalize the successcase for atoms within ordinary deduction systems.6 Deduction rules for top-levelambiguitiesThe inference in (18) can be realised very easily ifwe allow components of UDRSs that are marked ne-gative to be replaced by components with a smal-ler denotation.
Likewise components of UDRSs thatare marked positive may be replaced by componentswith a larger denotation.
If the component to be re-placed is the restrictor of a generalized quantifier,then in addition to the polarity marking the sound-ness of such substitutions depends on the persist-ence property of the quantifier.
In the frameworkof UDRSs persistence of quantifiers has to be defi-ned relative to the context in which they occur.
LetNPi be a persistent (anti-persistent) NP.
Then NPiis called persistent (anti-persistent) in clause S, ifsIf we would treat ambiguous clauses as the disjunc-tions of their meanings, i.e.
take the consequence relationin (1), then this disambiguation could be compensatedfor by applying RESTART (see \[7\] for details).
But re-lative to the consequence r lation under (8) RESTARTis not sound!this property is preserved under each disambiguati-on of S. So everybody  is anti-persistent in (19e),but not in (19a), because the wide scope reading forthe negation blocks the inference in (19b).
It is notpersistent in (19c) nor in (19d).(19)a.

Some problem was solved by everybody.The main rule of inference for UDRSs is the followingR(eplacement)R(ule).RR  Whenever some UDRS K:~- occurs in a UDRS-database A and A I-K:~- >>/C~ holds, then K:gmay be added to A.RR is based on the following substitution rule.
The>>-rules are given below.SUBST Let hK be a DRS component occurring insome UDRS )U, A a UDRS-database.
Let K:' bethe UDRS that results from K: by substitutingK '  for K.Then A KK: >>/C', if (i) or (ii) holds.
(i) l has positive polarity and A K K >> K'.
(ii) l has negative polarity and A K K '  >> K.Schematically we represent the rule (for the case ofpositive polarity) as follows.3- +' l+:K if A K l+:K >> l+:K I A, IC~- +--, l+:K 'For UDRS-components we have the following rule.>> DRS:  A K K>>K' if there is a functionf: UK--r UK, such that for all 7' E CK, there is a"\[ E CK with A ~- f (7)>>7' .
9Complex conditions are dealt with by the followingset of rules.
Except for persistence properties theyare still independent of the meaning of any particu-lar generalized quantifier.
The success of the rulescan be achieved in two ways.
Either by recursivelyapplying the >>-rules.

Rules for nouns and verbs refer toa further inference relation, t-n.
This relation takesthe meaning postulates into account that a parti-cular lexical theory associates with particular wordmeanings.>> Lex:(i) (every, 11,12>>>(more than half, 11,12>(ii) (every, ll, 12)>>({}, {Mary}, 12}(iii) (no, ll, 12)>>(every, 11,I~2:-~12)(iv) (some, 11, ll2:-,12)>>(not every, 11,/2)(v) snore>>sleep if }_z: snore>>sleepThe last rule allows relative scopes of quantifiers tobe inverted.>> 7r:(i) Let ~ :~/1 and 12 :V2 be two quantifiers of a UDRS\]C such that 11 immediately dominates /2 (/2 _<iscope(f1)).
Let 7r be the relation between quantifiersthat allows neigbourhood exchanges, i.e.
7~ ~ V2 iff\]Q, ~- \]C~,, where/C~, results from \]Q1 by exchanging71 and V2, i.e.
by replacing 12 <i scope(f1) in /Ch'sORD by 11 <i scope(12).
ThenA }- /C h >> /CI, if 11:71 7r 4:72 and 11:71 ~r l':~/' forall l' :V ~ that may be immediately dominated by/1 :V1(in any disambiguation).
(ii) Analoguously for the case of 1/7:71 having nega-tive polarity.The formulation of this rule is very general.
In thesimplest case it allows one to derive a sentence wherean indefinite quantifier is interpreted non-specificallyfrom an interpretation where it is assigned a speci-fic meaning.
If the specific/non-specific d stinction isdue to a universally quantified NP then the rule usesthe fact that (a,l, s}~(every, l, s) holds.
As otherscope bearing elements may end up between the in-definite and the universal in some disambiguationthe rule may only be applied, if these elements be-have exactly the same way as the universal does, i.e.allow the indefinite to be read non-specifically.
In ca-se such an element is another universally quantifiedNP we thus may apply the rule, but we cannot applyit is a negation.7 Conclusion and FurtherPerspect ivesThe paper has shown that it is possible to reasonwith ambiguities in a natural, direct and intuitivelycorrect way.The fact that humans are able to reason with am-biguities led to a natural distinction between deduc-tion systems that apply rules of proof to reduce thecomplexity of a goal and systems of logic that aretailored directly for natural language interpretati-on and reasoning.
Human interpreters seem to useboth systems when they perform reasoning tasks.We know that we cannot surmount undecidability(in a non-adhoc way) if we take quantifiers and/orconnectives as logical devices in the traditional sen-se.
But as the deduction rules for top-level ambi-guities given here present an extension of Aristoteli-an syllogism metamathematical results about theircomplexity will be of great interest as well as theproof of a completeness theorem.
Apart from this re-search the use of the rule system within the task ofnatural language understanding is under investiga-tion.
It seems that the Replacement Rules are par-ticularly suited to do special reasoning tasks nec-cessary to disambiguate l xical ambiguities, becausemost of the deductive processes needed there are in-dependent of any quantificational structure of thesentences containing the ambiguous item.AcknowledgementsThe ideas of this paper where presented, first at aninternational workshop of the SFB 340 "Sprachtheo-~etisehe Grundlagen der Computerlinguistik" in Oc-tober 1993, and second, at a workshop on 'Deductionand Language' that took place at SOAS, London, inspring 1994.
