OVERVIEW AND ACCOMPLISHMENTSTHE SE/CM PERSPECTIVETIPSTER SE/CMTIPSTER @TIPS TER.
o r gTHE SE/CM PROCESSThe SE/CM process, which is part of theoverall TIPSTER program, includes thefollowing responsibilities:?
Track Application Conformance withthe Architectureand the lessons learned are fed back into theArchitecture for the purpose of refining thosedetails which have been determined andspecifying those interfaces which remain underspecified.
These changes are being managed by aConfiguration Control process administered bythe TIPSTER Program SE/CM supportcontractor.?
Conduct Engineering Review Boards(ERBs)?
Track and Evaluate ArchitectureRequests for Changes (RFCs)?
Exercise Configuration Control ofOfficial TIPSTER documentsCONFORMANCE TO THEARCHITECTUREThe TIPSTER Architecture has beencompleted to the extent that the basic~nctionality of components has been determined.Many interfaces, however, have not yet beendefined to the level of detail which will beneeded for the Government to meet its goals ofsoftware reuse and modular upgrading; i.e., theyare under specified.
The Architecture has beenconstructed with a high level of abstraction andflexibility.
With these characteristics,applications can comply with the Architecturewith relative ease, but the interface lements donot have enough constraints to be preciselydefined in an Interface Control Document.
As anexample, specific annotation types have not yetbeen defined, specified and made available as aTIPSTER standard.
In another example, theattributes for a document may be anything thedeveloper chooses with no constraints ondefinition or scope.In TIPSTER Phase II, the Architecture isbeing tested by use in a number of applicationsUnder these circumstances, conformance tothe TIPSTER Architecture cannot be rigidlydef'med.
For the current Architecture,conformance is def'med as follows:Designs of applications or products aresubmitted to a TIPSTER Engineering ReviewBoard (ERB).
The ERB produces a TIPSTERArchitecture Conformance Assessment Document(TACAD) detailing the ways in which thedesign complies with the Architecture and thosewhere it does not.
Regarding those placeswithin the design which do not comply, theERB issues a recommendation, that theArchitecture be changed, that the design bechanged, or that the exception be allowed.
Thisrecommendation is reviewed by the TIPSTERConfiguration Control Board.
All designs arekept on record, both in Design-to and As-builtform, with the TIPSTER SE/CM.This process will result in an enrichment ofthe Architecture with the experience gained ffi'omspecific implementations as well as thebeginnings of a library of information about whatTIPSTER compliant components existthroughout the Government community.Figure 1 shows the basic ERB process withtwo principal gates that a project must passthrough.
The ERB review just before thePreliminary Design Review is the first ERB toinitially examine TIPSTER conformance.
Thelevel of conformance is documented in theTACAD.
The final ERB occurs after thecompletion of the project implementation.211E3ERB \[D Ac\[3 CCBSystemInitiationSystemImplementationSystemO&MTIPSTER ProgramCan ProvideArchitecture Designand SpecificationsPreliminaryDesignReviewFigure 1FinalOperatingCapabilityReviewERBProcessTIPSTER ProgramCan Support theIntegration of NewTechnology andAlgorithms212
