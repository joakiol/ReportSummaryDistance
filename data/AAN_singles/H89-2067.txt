Robust Speech Recognition TechnologyProgram Summary 1Principal Investigators: Clifford J. Weinstein and Douglas B. PaulMIT Lincoln LaboratoryThe objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate robust, high-performance continu-ous speech recognizer (CSR) techniques and systems focussed on application in spoken language sys-tems (SLS).
The techniques are based on a continuous-observation Hidden Markov Model (HMM)approach, which has previously demonstrated high performance for normal speech and robustnessfor stressed speech.
The motivation is that current state-of-the-art CSR systems must be improvedin performance and robustness for advanced SLS environments, with variabilities including thosedue to spontaneous speech, noise, and task-induced stress.
The focus of the robust CSR techniqueson SLS applications is being facilitated by development and implementation of a well-structuredinterface between a CSR and a natural language processor (NLP), allowing collaboration with othergroups developing NLPs for SLS applications.The Lincoln program began with a focus on improving speaker stress robustness for the fighteraircraft environment.
A robust HMM isolated-word recognition (IWR) system was developed with99% accuracy under stress conditions, representing more than an order-of-magnitude reduction inerror rate relative to a baseline HMM system.The robustness techniques were then adapted to large vocabulary CSR with high performancefor both speaker-dependent a d speaker-independent tasks on the DARPA Resource Managementdatabase.Recent accomplishments include: (1) development and integration into HMM CSR systemof tied-mixture and word-context-dependent phone-modelling techniques; (2) development anddemonstration of a voice-controlled flight simulator system - -  a simple, but complete SLS whichintegrates the robust CSt~ into a stressing, real-time task; and (3) development of a proposedspecification for a structured interface between CSR and NLP, based on a stack decoder controlstructure.Plans for the current program include: (1) continue to improve HMM CSi~ performance and ro-bustness using tied-mixture techniques and techniques to match the model complexity to amount oftraining data; (2) develop new acoustic-phonetic modelling and recognition techniques; (3) completethe CSR/NLP interface design, incorporating inputs from other groups, and develop a prototypeinterface implementation; (4) convert HMM CSR to use a stack decoder control structure, to matchthe CSR-NLP interface and to allow integration of the Lincoln CSR with an NLP developed atanother site.1This work was sponsored by DARPA.451
