M?rovsk?, Pavl?na J?nov?, Lucie Pol?kov?Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Mathematics and PhysicsInstitute of Formal and Applied Linguisticsmirovsky|jinova|polakova@ufal.mff.cuni.czAbstractThe aim of the demo is threefold.
First, it introduces the current version of the annotation toolfor discourse relations in the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0.
Second, it presents the dis-course relations in the treebank themselves, including new additions in comparison with theprevious release.
And third, it shows how to search in the treebank, with focus on the discourserelations.1 IntroductionThe Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0 (Bej?ek et al., 2013) is the newest version of the Prague Depen-dency Treebank series, succeeding versions 1.0 (PDT 1.0; Haji?
et al., 2001), 2.0 (PDT 2.0; Haji?
etal., 2006), 2.5 (PDT 2.5; Bej?ek et al., 2012) and Prague Discourse Treebank 1.0 (PDiT 1.0; Pol?kov?et al., 2012, 2013).
It is a corpus of Czech, consisting of almost 50 thousand sentences annotatedmostly manually on three layers of language description: morphological, analytical (surface syntacticstructure), and tectogrammatical (deep syntactic structure).
On top of the tectogrammatical layer, ex -plicitly marked discourse relations, both inter- and intra-sentential ones, have been annotated.
The dis-course annotation first appeared in PDiT 1.0, and it was corrected and updated for the newest releaseof the Prague Dependency Treebank, PDT 3.0.In Section 2, we present the annotation tool for discourse relations in PDT 3.0.
In Section 3, webriefly introduce principles of discourse annotation in PDT 3.0.
Section 4 is dedicated to searching inPDT 3.0, focusing on searching for discourse relations.2 The Annotation ToolThe primary format of PDT since version 2.0 is called PML (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/jazz/PML/).
It is anabstract XML based format designed for annotation of linguistic corpora, especially treebanks.
Data inthe  PML format  can be  browsed and edited in  TrEd,  a  fully  customizable  tree  editor  (Pajas  and?t?p?nek, 2008).
TrEd is written in Perl and can be easily customized to a desired purpose by exten -sions that are included into the system as modules.
The TrEd extension for discourse annotation inPDT was first described in M?rovsk?
et al.
(2010).
Here we summarize the main features of the tool,including additions that have been made since the previous version.
Also the data format of discourserelations in PDT 3.0 has undergone several changes.The data format and the tool for annotation of discourse in PDT allow for:?
Creation of a link between arguments of a relation; the link is depicted with a thick orange ar-row between nodes representing the arguments (see Figure 2 below).?
Exact specification of the extent of the arguments of the relation; it takes advantage of the treestructure of the tectogrammatical layer and specifies the range of an argument as a set of (sub)trees;in unclear cases the argument can be defined as an under-specified sequence of trees starting (ornewly also ending) at a given point in the data.
In rare cases, an arbitrary set of individual nodescan be specified as an argument as well.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Assigning a connective to the relation; the connective can be defined as a list of tectogrammati -cal nodes and, if needed, also by nodes from the lower (analytical) layer.
Newly also extended con-nectives can be assigned to the relation, which is an addition required by the on-going annotation ofso called AltLexes (alternative lexicalizations of connectives).?
Setting additional information to the relation (a type, a source, a comment etc.
); newly also aflag for the AltLex can be indicated and also a flag for negation of a discourse type.?
Assigning other discourse related information to nodes at the tectogrammatical layer; articleheadings, table or figure captions and metatext can be indicated at the root node of the respectivephrase.3 Discourse Relations in PDT 3.0Annotation of discourse relations in PDT 3.0 is inspired by the PDTB lexical approach of connectiveidentification (Prasad et al., 2008) but it also takes advantage of the Prague tradition of dependencylinguistics (see e.g.
Sgall et al., 1986).
While in PDTB approach, a list of possible discourse connec -tives was created and according to it, contexts for annotators were prepared, we only defined a connec-tive theoretically and left annotators to go through the whole text and identify all such constructionswith a connective function.
In the first  and second release of discourse annotation (PDiT 1.0 andPDT 3.0), only discourse relations indicated by overly present (explicit) discourse connectives, i.e.
ex-pressions like but, however, as a result, even though etc.
have been annotated.
Every discourse connec-tive is thought of as a discourse-level predicate that takes two discourse units as its arguments.
Onlydiscourse relations connecting clausal arguments (with a predicate verb) have been annotated.
ThePrague discourse annotation also includes marking of list structures (as a separate type of discoursestructure) and marking of smaller text phenomena like article headings, figure captions, metatext etc.The annotation proceeded first manually for cases where the tectogrammatical layer did not allowfor identifying a discourse relation automatically.
Afterwards, using the information (mostly) from thetectogrammatical layer, we were able to identify and mark almost 10 thousand out of more than 12thousand intra-sentential relations automatically ?
arguments (verbal phrases), types of relations andthe connectives were identified using tree structures of the sentences, tectogrammatical functors (typesof dependency or coordination), and morphological tags (details in J?nov?
et al., 2012).The Prague discourse label set was inspired by the Penn sense tag hierarchy (Prasad et al., 2008)and by the tectogrammatical functors (Mikulov?
et al., 2005).
The four main semantic classes, Tempo-ral, Contingency, Contrast (Comparison) and Expansion are identical to those in PDTB but the hierar-chy itself is only two-level (see Pol?kov?
et al., 2013).
The third level is captured by the direction ofthe discourse arrow.
Within the four classes, the types of relations partly differ from the Penn sensesand go closer to Prague tectogrammatical functors and/or are a matter of language-specific distinc -tions.
The annotators, unlike in the Penn approach, were not allowed to only assign the major class,they always had to decide for a specific relation within one of the classes.PDT 3.0 brings an update of the discourse annotation released in PDiT 1.0.
It has been enrichedwith several newly annotated (or not yet released) discourse-related phenomena, namely genre specifi -cation of the corpus texts (see Pol?kov?
et al., 2014), annotation of some type of rhematizers (or fo-culizing particles) as discourse connectives, and annotation of second relations (discourse relationswith more than one semantic type).
Also a new attribute discourse_special for several special roles ofphrases has been introduced.We newly annotated foculizing particles in structures with conjunction, to see how these particlescooperate with other types of connectives in discourse.
Second relations were annotated in the data al-ready before the PDiT 1.0 release but only in the annotator's comment, which did not become a part ofthe official release.
In PDT 3.0, each second relation has been captured as an additional full-fledgedrelation with its own type and connective.
It means that the arguments in question are connected withtwo arrows representing two discourse relations.The newly introduced attribute  discourse_special  captures three special roles of the phrase repre-sented by a node and its subtree; the possible values are: ?heading?
(article headings; replaces attributeis_heading  from PDiT 1.0), ?metatext?
(text not belonging to the original newspaper text, producedduring the creation of the corpus), and ?caption?
(for captions of pictures, graphs etc.
).11 Metatext and caption were also annotated already before the PDiT 1.0 release in the annotator's comment (but not published there).354 Searching in PDT 3.0For searching in PDT, a client-server based system called PML-TQ has been developed (PML-TreeQuery; Pajas and ?t?p?nek, 2009).
It belongs to the most powerful systems for searching in treebanks.The server part is implemented either as a relational database or as a system in a command-line ver -sion of TrEd (btred).
The client part uses either the tree editor TrEd along with a PML-TQ extension ora web browser.
The web browser client has however some limitations, so (in the demo) we focus onTrEd with the PML-TQ extension.Queries in PML-TQ can be created both in a textual form and (in the TrEd client) in a graphical en-vironment.
The query language allows to define properties of tree nodes and relations among them, in-side or between sentences and also across the layers of annotation.
Negation on the tree structure andBoolean expressions over the relations can be used.
Results of the corpus search can be viewed alongwith the context or processed with output filters to produce statistical tables.
A detailed documentationcan be found at  http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pmltq/doc/pmltq_doc.html, in the demo we will offer an introduc-tion to the principal parts of the language along with a set of illustrative examples, from the basicqueries to more complex ones, respecting requests from the audience.The following example shows how to search for a discourse relation.
The query defines two tec-togrammatical nodes (t-nodes) connected with a special ?member?
node that represents a discourse re-lation between the two nodes.
The required type of the discourse relation can be specified at the mem-ber node, in this example it is set to ?reason?.
The query also specifies that the start and target nodes ofthe relation are not from the same tree, i.e.
it looks for an inter-sentential discourse relation of the se -mantic type ?reason?.Textual form of the query:t-node[ !same-tree-as $t,member discourse[ discourse_type = "reason",target_node.rf t-node $t := [  ] ] ];Graphical form of the query:The following two sentences represent one of the results of the query:Pronik?n?
do ciz?ch po?
?ta?ov?ch syst?m?
je podle na?ich z?kon?
beztrestn?.Policie tak jen bezmocn?

SL?DILOV?.
[Infiltration of other computer systems is according to our laws not a criminal act.Thus the police only helplessly watches, as SNOOPERS rage in banks.
]Figure 2 captures the tectogrammatical annotation of these two sentences, along with the discourse re-lation represented by the thick orange arrow connecting roots of the two respective propositions.Results of queries in PML-TQ can be further processed using output filters.
Thanks to an output filter,a result of a query does not consist of individual matching positions in the trees but of a tabular sum-mary of all the matching positions, specified by the output filter.Figure 1: Graphical form of the query36If we modify the previous query by deleting the definition of the discourse type (discourse_type ="reason"), naming the member node ($d :=) and adding an output filter (the last line with prefix >>):t-node[ !same-tree-as $t,member discourse $d :=[ target_node.rf t-node $t := [  ] ] ];>> for $d.discourse_type give $1, count() sort by $2 desc...the query will search for all inter-sentential discourse relations in the data and ?

produce the following distribution table of the discourse types, sorted in the descending orderby the number of occurrences (only a few selected lines are printed here to save space):opp 1,800conj 1,389reason 1,031...grad 204restr 172explicat 130...Table 1: (Selected) results of the output filter5 ConclusionA good annotation tool, well designed annotation guidelines, and a powerful search tool are necessaryparts of a well managed project of any linguistic annotation.
In the demo, we present all these parts forthe current version of annotation of discourse relations in the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0.The PML as a data format, the annotation tool TrEd and the search system PML-TQ can be andhave been extensively used for many other annotation tasks in PDT and also for many other treebanks,see for example a project of harmonizing various treebanks in HamleDT (Zeman et al., 2012).AcknowledgmentThe authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (projectsP406/12/0658 and P406/2010/0875).
