Thiswork represents the first effort for parsing Turkish.
Ourimplementation is based on Tomita's parser developed atCarnegie-Mellon University Center for Machine Transla-tion.
The grammar covers a substantial subset of Turkishincluding simple and complex sentences, and deals with areasonable amount of word order freeness.
The complexagglutinative morphology of Turkish lexical structures ishandled using a separate two-level morphological nalyzer.After a discussion of key relevant issues regarding Turkishgrammar, we discuss aspects of our system and present re-sults fi'om our implementatiou.
Our initial results suggestthat our system can parse about 82% of the sentences directlyand almost all the remaining with very minor pre-editing.1 INTRODUCTIONAs part of our ongoing work on the development of compu-tational resources for natural anguage processing in Turk-ish we have undertakeu the development of a parser forTurkish using the lexical-functional grammar formalism,for use in a mtmber of applications.
This work representsthe first approach to the computational nalysis of Turk-ish, though there have been a number of studies of Turkishsyntax fi'om a linguistic perspective ( .g., \[Meskill 1970\]).Our implementation is based on Tomita's parser developedat Carnegie-Mellon University Center for Machine Transla-tion \[Musha et.al.
1988, Tomita 1987\].
Our grammar cov-ers a substantial subset of Turkish including simple andcomplex sentences, and deals with a reasonable amount ofword order freeness.Turkish has two characteristics that have to be taken intoaccount: agglutinative morphology, and rather ti'ee wordorde r with explicit case marking.
We handle the rather com-plex agglutinative morphology of the Turkish lexical struc-tures using a separate morphological processor based onthe two-level paradigm \[Evans 1990, Otlazer 1993\] that wehave integrated with the lexical-functional grammar parser.Word order freeness is dealt with by relaxing the order ofphrases in the phrase structure parts of lexical-functionalgramm.ai" rule by means of generalized phrases.IThis work was done as a part of the first author's M.Sc.

A lexical-functional grammarassigns two levels of syntactic description to every sen-tence of a language: aconstituent s ructure and a functionalstructure.
Constituent s ructures (c-structures) characterizethe phrase structure configurations a a conventional phrasestructure tree, while surface grammatical functions uch assubject, object, and adjuncts are represented in functionalstructure (f-structure), Because of space limitations we willnot go into the details of the theory.
One can refer to Kaplanand Bresnan \[Kaplan and Bresnan 1982\] for a thorough dis-cussion of the LFG formalism.3 TURKISH SYNTAXIn this section, we would like to highlight wo of the rele-vant key issues in Turkish grammar, namely highly inflectedagglutinative morphology and free word order, and give adescription of the structural classification of Turkish sen-tences that we deal with.3.1 MorphologyTurkish is an agglutinative language with word structuresformed by productive affixations of derivational nd inflec-tional suffixes to root words \[Ottazer 1993\].
This extensiveuse of suffixes causes morphological parsing of words to berather complicated, and results iu ambiguous lexical inter-pretations in many cases.
For example:(1) ~ocuklarla.
child+PLU+3SG-POSS his childrenb.
child+3PL-POSS their childc.
child+PLU+3PL-POSS their childrend.
child+PLU+ACC children (acc.
)Such ambiguity can sometimes be resolved at phraseand sentence l vels by the help of agreement requireuletltsthough this is not always possible:(2a) Onlarm qocuklarl geldiler.it+PLU+GEN child+PLU cone+PAST+3PL-POSS +3PL(Their children came.

)child+PLU+31)I:POSS come+PAST+3PI.
(Their children came.
)For example, in (2a) only the interpretation (l c) (i.e., :heiret,ihlren) is possible because:?
the agreement requirement between lhe modifier andthe modified parts in a possessive compound normeliminates ( la) .
~,, the facts that gel (come) does not subcategorize foran accusative marked direct object, and that in Turkishthe subject of a sentence must be nominative 3 elintinatel id).?
the agreement requirement between the subject and theverb of a sentence liminates l ib).
4In (2b), both (l a) and (l c) are possible (his children, andtheir children, respectively) because the moditier of the pos-sessive compound noun is It covert one: it may be eitheronun (his) or onlartn (their).
The other two interpretationsare eliminated ue to the same reasons as in (2a).3.2  Word OrderIf we concern ourselves with the typical order o\[ con-stituents, Turkish can be characterized as being a subject -object-verb (SOV) language, though the data in Table 1fiom Erguwmh \[Erguwmh I979\], shows that other ordersfor constituents are also common (especially in discourse).In Turkish it is not the position, but the case of a nounphrase that determines its grammatical function in the sei1-tence.
Consequently typical order of the constituents maychange rather freely without affecting the grammaticalityof a sentence.
Due to various syntactic and pragmaticconstraints, sentences with the non-typical orders are not2The agreement of the modilier milSt be tim sanle as the Imssessivc olthe moditied wilh the exception that if the modilicr is third llerson phn'althe imssessive of the modilied may be third person singular.31u Turkish, the nominative caste is IlUltl~lrkctl.4In a "turkish sentence, person leattu'es of Ihe subject and the veil)sbould be the sitllle.

For ex-.an@e, a constituenl lhat is to be emphasized is generallyplaced immediately before the verb.
This affects the placesof all the constittmnts in a sentence xcept that of the verb:(3a) Ben ~,'ocu~a kilabt verdim.1 chiki+l)AT book+ACe give+PASTt.

)(3a) is an example of tim typk:al word order whereas in(31)) the subject, ben, is eml)hasized.
Similarly, in (3c) theindirect object, ('oeu,@, is eml)hasized.In addition to these i)ossihle changes, the verb itself tnaymove away from its lypical place, i.e., the end or Ihe sen-{CIICC.

The sentences in 12), (3), (4a),(5a), and (6) are all examples of simple sentences.,Complex Sentences : In Turkish, a sentence can be trans-formed into a construction with a verbal notttt, a participleor a gerund by affixing certain suffixes to the verb of thesentence.
Complex sentences are those that include suchdependent (subordinate) clauses as their constituents, or asmodifiers of their constituents.
Dependent clauses maythemselves contain other dependent clauses.
So, we mayhave embedded structures such as:(7) Burada suhere+LOC waterbulamayaca~imlfind+NEG-POT+FUT+PART+ISG-POSS+ACColmazdLbe+NEG+AOR+PAST+3SGiqilebilecekdrink+PASS+POT+FUT+PARTzannetmek do~,ruthink+lNF right(It wouldn't have been right for me to think that I wouldn'tbe able to find drinkable water here.
)The subject of (7) (burada i?ilebilecek su bulamay-acafi, tmt zannetmek - to think that I wouldn't be able to finddrinkable water here) is a nominal dependent clause whosedefinite object (burada ifilebilecek su bulamayaca~mtt -that I wouldn't be able to find drinkable water here) is anadjectival dependent clause which acts as a nominal one.The indefinite object of this defnite object (ifilebilecek su-dr inkable water) is a conlpound noun whose nlodifierpart is another adjectival dependent clause (ifilebilecek -drinkable), and modified part is a noun (su - water).It should be noted that there are other types of sentencesin the classification according to structure, ttowever, wewill not be concerned with them here because of spacelimitations.
(See $im~ek \[$imsek 1987\], and Gting(~rdft\[GfingOrdi~ 1993\] for details.

Thislexicon is nminly used for morpbological nalysis .
'rod haslimited additional syntactic and semantic information, andis augmented with an argument structure database.
8Figure 1 shows the architecture of our system.
Whena sentence is given as input to tbe program, the programfirst calls the morphological nalyzer lot- each word in thesentence, and keeps the results of these calls in a list tobe used later by the parser."
If the tnorpt'~ological tmlyzerfails to return a structure for a word for any reason (e.g.,the lexicon may lack the word or the word may be mis-spelled), the program returns with an error message.
Afterthe morphological ttalysis is completed, the parser is in-voked to check whether the sentence is granmmtical.
Theparser performs bottom-up arsing.
During this analysis,whenever it consumes a new word from {he sentence, itpicks lip the morphological structttrc of this word from thelist.
If the word is a finite verb or an intinitiwtl, the parser isalso provided with the subcategorizatiou frante o1' the word,At the end of the analysis, if the sentence is grammatical,its f-structure is output by the parser.8The morphological mudyzer eturns a list nfJkature-vahw pairs.

Ourgrammar inchldes rules for sentences, dependent clauses,noun phrases, adjectival phrases, postpositional phraxes,adverbial constructs, verb phrases, and a number of h:~:i-cal look up rules.

"lable 2 presents the number of rulesfor each category in the grammar.
There are also someintermediary rules, not shown here.Recall that the typical order of constituents in a sentencemay change due to a number of reasons.
Since the order ofphrases is tixed in the phrase structure component of an LFGrule, tiffs rather free nature of word order in sentence levelconstitutes a major problem.
In order to keep fi'om using anumber of  redundant rules we adopt tbe following strategyin our rules: We use the same place bolder, <XP>,  for allthe syntactic ategories in the phrase structure componentof a sentence or a dependent chmse rule, and check thecategories of these phrases in the eqtmtions part of the rule.In Figure 2, we give a granmmr rule for the sentence with twoconstituents, with an informal description of the equatkmpart.~Recall also that an indefinite object shouk\[ be placed im-mediately before tile verb, :md some adverbial complenmntsof quality (those that are actually qualitative adjectives) al-ways precede tile verb or, if it exists, the indefinite directobject.
In our grammar, we treat such objects and adverbialcomplements as parts of the verb phrase.
So, we do notcheck these constraints at the sentence or depeudeut clauselevel.6 PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONIn this section, we present some results about the lmrfor -mance of  our system on test runs with four difl'erent texts ondifferent opics.

I'eIn all of  the texts there were some sentences outside ourscope.
These were:,, sentences that contain finite sentences as their con-stituents or modifiers of their constituents,,, conditional sentences,,, finite sentences that are connected by coordinators(and/or), and,, sentences with discontinuous constituents.
13We pre-edited the texts so that the sentences were inour scope (e.g., separated finite sentences connected by co-ordinators and parsed them as independent sentences, andignored the conditional sentences).
Table 3 presents SOmEstatistical information about the test runs.
The first, sec-ond and third columns how the document number, the totalnumber of sentences and the number of sentences that WEcould parse without pre-editing, respectively.
The othercolumns show the number of sentences that we totally ig-nored, the nnmber of  sentences in the pre-edited versions ofthe documents, average nnmber of parses per sentence gen-erated and average CPU time for each of the sentences in thetexts, respectively.
It can be seen that our grammar can suc-cessfully deal with about 82% of the sentences that we haveexperimented with, with almost all remaining sentences be-coming passable after a minor pre-editing.
This indicatesthat our grammar coverage is reasonably satisfactory.Below, we present the output for a sentence which showsvery nicely where the structural ambigttity comes out inTurkish.

We intend to integrate his to our system soon.13Word order freeness inTurkish allows various kinds of discontinuousconsfituents,e.g., an adverbial djunct cutting in tile middle of a compoundnoun.14This example is not in any of the texts mentioned above.

To the best of our knowledge this is the tirst sucheffort for constructing a computational grammar for Tnrk-ish.
Our domain includes tructurally simple and complexTurkish sentences.
The rather complex morphological nal-yses of agglutinative words structures of Turkish are han-dled by a full-scale two-level morphological speciticationimplemented in PC-KIMMO.We have number of directions for improving our grammarand parser:?
Turkish is very rich in terms of adverbial constructs.We handle a great deal of these constructs by using alarge number of rules.
We are now in the process ofdeveloping a tagger with a multi-word construct rec-ognizer to preprocess the text so that many multi-wordand idiomatic constructs can he handled outside thegrammar.
In this way, multi-word constructs such asyapar yapmaz (do+AOR+3SG do+NEG+AOR+3SG)(as soon as (one) does (that)) where both lexical cat-egories are verbal but the coml~ound construct is anadverb, can be handled, so can idiomatic constructslike yant stra (side+3SG-POSS row) (besides) wherethe flmction and semantics of the multi-word constructhas nothing to do with the function and semantics ofthe constituent lexical tbrms.?
We are currently working on extending the subset ofsentences dealt with in respect of structure.?
We are currently working on augmenting our lexiconwith substantial lexical information and selectional re-striction information to be used with an integrated on-tological database.8 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe would like to thank Carnegie-Mellon University, Cen-ter for Machine Translation for making awfilablc to us theirLFG parsing system.
