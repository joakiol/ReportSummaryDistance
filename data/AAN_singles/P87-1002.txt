A COMPOSITIONAL SEMANTICS OF TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS INENGLISHErhard W. HinrichsBBN Laboratories Inc.10 Moulton St.Cambridge, MA 02238AbstractThis paper describes a compositional semanticsfor temporal expressions as part of the meaningrepresentation language (MRL) of the JANUS system,a natural language understanding and generation sys-tem under joint development by BBN Laboratoiresand the Information Sciences Institute.
1 The analysisis based on a higher order intansional ogic describedin detail in Hinrichs, Ayuso and Scha (1987).
Tem-poral expressions of English are translated into thislanguage as quantifiers over times which bind tem-poral indices on predicates.
The semantic evaluationof time-dependent predicates is defined relative to aset of discourse contexts, which, following Reichen-bach (1947), include the parameters of speech timeand reference time.
The resulting context-dependentand multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expres-sions solves a set of well-known problems that arisewhen traditional systems of tense logic are applied tonatural language semantics.
Based on the principleof rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature ofthe analysis provides a straightforward and well-defined interface between the parsing component andthe semantic interpretation component of JANUS.1 IntroductionJANUS is a natural language understanding andgeneration system which allows the user to interfacewith several knowledge bases maintained by the USNAVY.
The knowledge bases contain, among otherthings, information about the deployment schedules,locations and readiness conditions of the ships in thePacific Reet.
(1) a.
Did the admiral deploy the ship?b.
Which C3 ships are now C4?c.
When will Vincent arrive in Hawaii?d.
Who was Frederick's previouscommander?As the sample queries in (1) demonstrate, much ofIThe work presented here was supported under DARPA contract#N00014-85-C-0016.
The views and conclusions contained in thisdocument are those of the authors and should not be interpreted asnecessarily representing the official policies, either expressed orimplied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or ofthe United States Government.this information is highly time-dependant: Shipschange locations in accordance with their deploymentschedules, incur equipment failures or undergo per-sonnel changes which can lead to changes in theship's readiness rating.
It is, therefore, imperative thatat the level of semantic representation of the naturallanguage input an adequate analysis can be providedfor those linguistic expressions that carry time infor-mation, for example, tenses, temporal adverbials andtemporal adjectives.2 Applying Classical Tense Logic ToNatural Language SemanticsMy own treatment of temporal expressions is verymuch a response to the kinds of analyses that havebeen provided in classical tense logic.
When I refer toclassical tense logic I mean the kinds of logics thatorginate in the work of the logician Arthur Prior (Prior1967) and that have been applied by Montague(Montague 1973) and others to natural languagesemantics.In classical tense logic time-dependency of infor-mation enters into the definition of the notion of aproposition.
Propositions are defined as functionsfrom a set of times TI to the set of truth values trueand false.
Declarative sentences of natural languageare taken to express propositions.
The sentence It israining can be taken to be that proposition whichyields the value true for those times at which it israining and false for those at which it is not.Tense operators can be defined in such a logic asin (2) and (3).
(2) defines a past operator capital Pwhich, applied to a proposition p, yields the value truefor some time t if the proposition p is true at sometime t' prior to t. Likewise, (3) defines a Y operator,where Y is mnemonic for yesterday, with the expectedtruth conditions: Yp is true at t if p is true at some timet' that falls within the prior to the day in which t falls.
(2) \[P P\]t =' T iff \[P\]r = T for some time t' < t.(3) \[Y Pit = Tiff \[P\]r = T for some timet' ?
\[DAY(t) - 1\].All of this sounds rather plausible.
However, it turnsout that if one tries to apply tense operators such as Pand Y in natural language semantics, a set of well-known problems arise.
23 Inadequacies Of Classical Tense Logic3.1 Interaction of Tense and Time AdverbialsThe first such problem, which I pointed out in Hin-richs (1981) and which has been independently notedby Dowty (1982), concerns the interaction betweentense and time adverbials.
If for sentence (4), oneinterprets the past tense in (4) by the P operator andthe adverbial yesterday by the Y operator, then one ofthe two operators has to have scope over the other.
(4) Vincent left yesterday.
(5) P \[ Y \[ leave' (Vincent') \] \](6) Y \[ P \[ leave' (Vincent') \] \]However, neither the formula in (5), nor the one in (6)gives adequate truth conditions for (4).
In (5) the Poperator shifts the temporal evaluation of the proposi-tion Y\[leave'(Vincent')\] from the speech time to somepast time t' and then the Y operator shifts evaluationto some time t" within the day prior to t', instead of theday prior to the speech time.
(6) assigns wrong truthconditions as well.
Here the Y operator shifts evalua-tion to some time within the day prior to the speechtime.
But then the P operator in turn shift evaluationto some time prior to that, but necessarily within thesame day.3.2 Interaction of Tense and NegationSimilar problems arise when one uses standardtense logic for sentences in which tense interacts withsentence negation as in (7).
As was first pointed outby Partee (1973), one can assign the past tenseoperator P either narrow scope with respect to nega-tion as in (8) or wide scope as in (9).
(7) Vincent did not leave.
(8) ~ \[ P \[ leave' (Vincent') \]\](9) P \[-~ \[ leave'(Vincent') \]\]However, neither the formula in (8), nor the one in (9)assigns adequate truth conditions to (7).
Formula (8)says that there exists no time in the past at which theproposition is true, clearly not capturing the meaningof (7).
(9) makes (7) true if at any time in the past=In fairness to Prior, it has to be pointed out that he designed histemporal mo0al ogics as purely formal systems anti did not designthem w~ idea of applying them to natural anguage.
However,Priorean tense logic has, nonetheless, been applied to naturallanguage semantics.
It is those studies that are subject to thecriticisms presented in sections 3.1 - 3.4Vincent did not leave.
Given that ships participate inevents other than arrivals at some point during theirexistence, (9) will be trivially satified, but does notcapture adequately the truth conditions of (7).3.3 Tense and Quantified NPThe third type of inadequacy of standard tenselogic has to do with the interaction of tense and quan-tified NP's and was first pointed out by Enc (1981).Enc points out that Priorean tense operators fail tocapture certain readings of sentences such as (10).
(10) Every admiral was (once) a cadet.
(1 1) V x \[ admiral'(x) --, P \[ cadet'(x) \]\](12) P \[ ~" x \[ admiral'(x) --~ cadet'(x) \]\]Since the past tense operator P is a propositionaloperator, it can take scope over the consequent of thematerial implication in (11).
(11) represents the read-ing that everyone who is an admiral now was a cadetat some time in the past.
The second reading in (12),where P has scope over the entire formula assignsthe somewhat absurd truth conditions that at sometime in the past every admiral as simultaneously acadet.
However, as Enc observes correctly, withpropositional tense operators one cannot obtain theperfectly natural reading that everyone who is an ad-miral now or who was an admiral at some time in thepast was a cadet at some time prior to being an ad-miral.3.4 Temporal AnaphoraThere is fourth problem that arises when one usestense operators of standard tense logic for the seman-tic interpretation of single sentences or pieces of dis-course that describe multiple events.
(13) Vincent was I~it by a harpoon, was aban-doned by its crew, and sank.The most natural interpretation of (13) is one in whichthe events are understood to have happened in thesame temporal order as they are sequenced in thesentence.
However, if one uses a Priorean Poperator to interpret each occurrence of the pasttense in (13), one arrives at an interpretation, whichincorrectly allows for any temporal ordering.4 A Tense Logic with Multiple IndicesIt turns out that most of the problems that I havejust discussed can be solved if one recognizes morethan one parameter of temporal evaluation.
In themodels given to tense logics such as the ones first9developed by Prior, one standardly evaluates proposi-tions with respect to a single time which one may callthe event time, the time at which an event happens orat which a state of affairs obtains.
The point ofspeech is taken to be a special case of thisparameter.An alternative to models with only one temporalparameter has been given by Reichenbach (1947).Reichenbach argues for distinguishing between threeparameters which he calls speech time, event timeand reference time.
The meaning of the first twoparameters hould be self-explanatory.
It is the thirdparameter, reference time, that requires explanation.Reichenbach conceives of reference time as the tem-poral perspective from which an event is viewed, asopposed to event time as the time at which the eventoccurs.
Reference time can be either implicit in thediscourse context or explicitly specified by temporaladverbials such as yesterday.
For each individualtense reference time is temporally ordered withrespect to the other two parameters.
Reference timeplays a crucial role in Reichenbach's account of thedistinction betwen the simple past and the presentperfect in English.
In both cases event time preceedsspeech time.
But while for the simple past, the eventtime is viewed from a perspective in the past, theevent is viewed from the perspective of the present inthe case of the present perfect.Given the distinction between reference time andevent time, one can then formalize Reichenbach'sanalysis of the past tense as in (14).
The operator Pshifts evaluation of the event time t to some time t' inthe past such that t' falls within some reference time r.(14) \[P P\]r,t = Tiff \[P\]r,r for some time t' such thatt' < t and t' ~; r.The Y operator on the other hand, does not shift theevent time t, rather it operates on the reference time rin the obvious way.
3(15) ~/P\]r,t == Tiff \[P\]\[DAY(t=)-I\],t = T.With the redefined operators P and Y, one can nowgive adequate truth conditions for sentences involvingtense and time adverbials.
In the formula in (16) Yspecifies the reference time r to be the day prior to thespeech time, and then the P operator locates theevent time as being within that reference time.
(16) \[Y \[ P \[ leave' (Vincent') \] \]r,t = Tiff \[ P \[leave' (Vincent') \]\]\[DAY(t=)-I\].t == Tiff \[ leave' (Vincent') \]\]\[OAY(t ).l\],t' == T forsome t'< t and t'~; \[DAY(ts)-I \].Likewise for tense and negation, the past operatorlocates the event time t prior to speech time andwithin some reference time r which in the case of (17)has to be taken to be contextually specified.
"=Operators similar to the redefined P and Y operators have firstbeen suggested in the literature by Acquist (1976).
(17) Vincent did not leave.
(18) \[7 \[P \[leave'(Vincent')\]\]\]r,t = Tiff \[ P\[leave'(Vincent')\]\]r, t =, Fiff \[leave'(Vincent') \]r,r = F for all times t'such that t' < t and t' <;; r.(17) is true according to (18) if there is no time withinthe reference time r at which the untensed proposition/eave'(Vincent') is true.It turns out that a multi-indexed tense logic alsogives an adequate account of tense in discourse.
Adetailed account of this can be found in Hinrichs(1981, 1986); here I will only sketch the basic idea:By ordering event times with respect to referencetimes, as sketched in (20), and by updating such ref-erence times after each event description, one canorder multiple events as described in (19) in the ap-propriate way.
The relations < and ~; in (20) aremeant to stand for temporal precedence and temporalinclusion, respectively.
(19) Vincent \[was hit by a harpoon\]%, \[was aban-doned by its crew\]e =, and \[sank\]%.

3Let us consider next two alternative logicalrepresentations for sentence (21) in such a multi=indexed logic.
(21) Vincent left yesterday.
(22) \[Y \[ P \[leave' (Vincent') \] \] \]r,t(23) 3 t' \[t' < t s & t r - \[DAY(ts) - 1\] & t' ?
t r& leave'(Vincent')(t') \]The one in (22) I have already discussed.
In (22) pasttense is translated into a propositional operator whosesemantics is implicit in the truth conditions imposedwith respect to the model-theory.
In the formula in(23) the past tense leads to existerltial quantificationover times.
The existential quantifier binds variableswhich appear as extra argument positions on predi-cates.
So, ship" which is ordinarily taken to be aone-place predicates turns into a two-place predicatethat takes individuals and times as its arguments.The variable t r occurs as a free variable in (23) andstands for the Reichenbachean reference time.Although the two formulas in (22) and (23) arelogically equivalent in the sense that both are trueunder the same set of models, I will adopt the style oflogical representation in (23) for remainder of thispaper This is because in the context of the JANUSsystem, it is important o explicitly quantify over timessince in the database times are explicitly entered asdates, time stamps, etc.
In order to be able to accessthem, it is important to incorporate time informationexplicitly at the level of logical form.A second reason for preferring the style of10representation in (23) over the one in (22) concernsthe interaction between tenses and quantified NP's.Since formulas such as (23) explicitly quantify overtimes, scope relations with respect to quantificationover individuals become completely transparent.5 Tense and Quantified Noun PhrasesUsing the style of representation exemplified byformula (23), let me then return to the issue of tenseand quantification, which is still unresolved.
Consideronce again the types of examples that, as Enc pointsout, cannot be handled in standard tense logic.
(24) Every admiral was (once) a cadet.
(25) V x \[ admirar(x) ---> P \[ cadet'(x) \]\](26) P \[ ~" x \[ admiral'(x) --e cadet'(x) \]\]If tense operators like P have scope over proposi-tions, P can either scope over an entire formula as in(25) or over the consequent of the material implicationas in (26).
Now, as we saw earlier, neither formulacaptures the reading that all present or past admiralswere cadets prior to their being admirals.Enc (1981) provides an interesting solution to theproblem posed by examples such as (24).
Her solu-tion is based on two assumptions: 1.
Semantically,tenses should have scope only over verb meanings,but not over any larger elements in a sentence, and 2.verb meanings as well as noun meanings are indexi-cal in the sense their interpretations depend on thecontext of the utterance in the same way thatdemonstrative pronouns such as that and anaphoricpronouns such as she and they do.As the formula in (27) shows, which representsthe translation for (24) in my analysis, I adopt Enc'sfirst assumption and assign tense scope only over themain verb of the sentence.
(27) V x \[ 3 t \[ admiral'(x)(t) & R (x)(t) \] --~\[ :1 t' \[ t' < t s & t' ~ t r & graduate-from'(West-Point')(x)(t') \]\]The predicate R in (27), whose role I will comment onin more detail shortly, is meant to range overproperties which are salient in a given context.
Thepast tense of sentence (24) contributes the existentialquantification over times t' that precede the speechpoint t s and are contained in some contextuallyspecified reference time t r. Following Enc, tense isthus given scope only over the predicate that cor-responds to the main verb.
However, the formula in(27) also shows that I do not follow Enc in her secondassumption, namely her treatment of nouns as indexi-cals.
In contrast to true indexicals, whose denotationdepends solely on the context of utterance, I treat thedenotation of predicates corresponding to nouns asbeing time-dependent in an absolute sense, sincepredicates such as admira/do carry a time-denotingargument position as part of their function-argumentstructure.
Without such an argument, it seems impos-sible to give a satisfactory account of temporal adjec-tives such as former and previous or/ast, whose func-tion it is to shift the temporal evaluation of the predi-cate that they combine with.
However, I do recognizean element of context dependency inherent in the in-terpretation of noun phrases such as every admiralsince I interpret such noun phrases with respect tosome contextually salient property R. This predicatemakes it possible to account for the well-knownphenomenon of restricted quantification, namely thatin sentences such as (28) the interpretation ofeveryone does not involve the set of all students inthe world, but rather the set of all individuals in agiven context; for example everyone at a certainparty.
4(28) Everyone is having a good time.Temporal evaluation of the verbal predicate is, thus,kept separate from the temporal evaluation of predi-cates corresponding to other constituents in the sen-tence.
As first pointed out by Enc, this strategymakes it possible to account for sentences such as(29) and (30) whose translations require that thepredicates secretary and fugitive be evaluated relativeto a time which is distinct from the evaluation time ofthe predicate corresponding to the verb.
s(2g) Oliver North's secretary testified before thecommittee.
(30) Every fugitive is now in jail.In contrast to an analysis which interprets the pasttense in terms of a Priorean P operator, the narrowscope analysis of tense also avoids the dilemma ofinducing a simultaneity reading for sentence (31), ifthe tense operator P has scope over the entire for-mula as in the translation (32) of (31).
(31) Every admiral graduated from West Point.
(32) P \[ 'd x \[admiral'(x) ~ graduate-from'(West-Point')(x)\]\]The reading in (32) is factually implausible for tworeasons: 1.
It imposes simultaneity as part of the truthconditions and requires that all admirals graduated atthe same time, 2. since the P operator forces tem-poral evaluation of all predicates in its scope at thesame index, in the case of (31) it requires that everyadmiral graduated from West Point as an admiral, andnot, as is actually the case, subsequent to graduationfrom the Naval academy.Notice that the formula in (33) , which representsthe translation of (31) in my analysis, avoids bothproblems associated with (32).
(33) ~' x \[ 3 t \[ admiral'(x)(t) & R (x)(t) \] --~\[ 3 t' \[ t' < t s & t' s t r & graduate-from'(West-Point')(x)(t') \]\]4The example is due to Stalnaker (1973).SRecail that Fawn Hall, North's secretary, testified before thecommittee when she was no longer North's ecretary.
The exampleis due to an editorial in the Boston Globe11Since temporal evaluation of the predicates admiral'and graduate-from" are kept separate, the firstproblem does not arise.
Since the predicates areexistentially quantified over independently, (33), incontrast to (32), also avoids having to assign a simul-taneity reading to (31).A crucial element of my analysis is the inclusion ofthe predicate R, which is meant to restrict he denota-tion of quantified NP 's  such as every ship byproperties that are salient in the context of utterance.Apart from keeping the temporal evaluation of verbalpredicates and nominal predicates independent ofone another, it is this context dependent feature of myanalysis that makes it more flexible than a wide scopeanalysis of tense.
Let me illustrate how the context-dependent evaluation of quantified NP's by onceagain focusing on example (34).
(34) Every admiral graduated from West Point.Imagine that (34) is uttered in a context in which allcurrent admirals assigned to the Pacific Fleet are un-der discussion.
In that context, R could be instan-tiated as in (35), i.e.
as the intension of the set ofindividuals x which are assigned to the Pacific Fleet ata time which equals the speech time t s.(35) ;Lt ~.y \[assigned-to'(Pac.Fleet')(y)(t) &  = ts\]Substituting R by (35) in (36), one then arrives at theformula in (37).
(36) V x \[ :1 t \[ admirar(x)(t) & R(x)(t) \] --+\[ 3 t' \[ t' < t s & t' e t r & graduate-from'(West-Point')(x)(t') \]\](37) V x \[ 3 t \[ admiral'(x)(t) & assigned-to'(Pac-Fleet')(x)(t) & t = t s \] ~ \[ =1 t' \[ t' < t s & t' ?
t r &graduate-from'(West-Point')(x)(t') \]\]In a context in which all present or past admirals inthe Pacific Fleet are under discussion, a readingwhich, as I pointed out in section 3.3, one cannotcapture using Priorean tense operators one can cap-ture by instantiating R as in (38), where < stands forthe relation temporally preceding or equaJ to.
(38) ~.t ~.y \[assigned-to'(Pac-Fleet')(y)(t) &  < ts\]The idea behind using the variable R in my analysisis, thus, to have it instantiated appropriately by thediscourse context.
One of the counterarguments thatone may raise against this context-dependent aspectof my analysis of temporal semantics concerns thefact that tracking the salience of objects and theirproperties in natural language discourse is anotoriously difficult problem.
However, I will argue inthe next section that whatever mechanisms areneeded to track saliency, such mechanisms aremotivated independently by semantic and pragmaticphenomena that go beyond phenomenon of temporalinterpretation.6 Evaluating Time-dependent Predicatesin ContextObjects and certain of their properties can receiveor maintain salience in a discourse in any number ofways.
The notions of focus (Sidner 1983), of commonground (Stalnaker 1978) and of mutual knowledge(Clark and Marshall 1981) are certainly cases in point.In this section I will concentrate on one suchmechanism which plays a role in the context-dependent interpretation of time dependent predi-cates.
I will argue that the mechanism is needed forpurposes other than temporal interpretation and,therefore, does not add complexity to my analysis oftemporal semantics.Consider a typical sequence of queries that a usermay present to JANUS.
(39) a.
Did every admiral deploy a shipyesterday?b.
Which ships will arrive in Hawaii?The person asking (39b) is not interested in beinginformed about all ships that at some time in the fu-ture will go to Hawaii.
Instead, the user is interestedin a much more restricted set of ships that will gothere, namely the ones that were deployed by someadmiral the day before.
In order to arrive at such aninterpretation, the free variable R in the translationformula in (40) has to be bound appropriately by thecontext.
(40) QUERY \[ Z z \[ z ~ POW\[Z y 3 t' \[ ship'(y)(t')& R(y)(t')\]\] & =1 t \[ t > t s & t ~ t r& go-to'(Hawaii')(z)(t) \]4 \]QUERY is a speech act operator which takes thepropositional content of the question as an argumentand causes to evaluate it at some temporal index, inthis case the point of speech t s. In (40) QUERY ap-plies to a lambda-abstract over those sets of objects xwhich are the speech time t s in the Indian Ocean andwhose members y at some time t have the property ofbeing a ship and which are in addition distinguishedby some contextually salient property R. POW standsfor the power set operation which I use for the inter-petation of plural nouns.
Now if the reader preferssome other approach to the semantics of plurals, saythe lattice-theoretic approach of l ink (1983), over theapproach based on power sets I am not going to ar-gue with them.
The point that I want to concentrateon with respect to the formula in (40) concerns theinstantiation of the context-dependent predicateR.
The predicate ship' has to be interpreted relative tothe discourse context, and the temporal evaluation ofthe predicate is determined with respect to that con-text, rather by the tense of the sentence, in this casethe future.It turns out that a detailed proposal for how totrack objects and their properties does, in fact, alreadyexist in the literature.
In her work on the interpretation12of pronouns in discourse, Webber (1978,1983) hasdeveloped a framework that constructs during the in-terpretation of a discourse a context which consists ofa set of what she calls discourse entities.
These dis-course entities then become available as objects thatpronouns can refer to.
One of the examples thatWebber discusses is the interpretation of the pronounthey in (42) in the context of sentence (41).
(41) Every admiral deployed a ship yesterday.
(42) They arrived.Clearly they refers to the set of ships deployed bysome admiral.
What is interesting, of course, aboutthe example is that syntactically there is no pluralnoun phrase in the preceding discourse that couldserve as the referent for the plural pronoun they.In order to derive the appropriate discourse entityfor the interpretation of they, Webber suggests therule schema as in (43).
(43) says that for any formulathat meets this structural description, a discourse en-tity identified by this formula is to be constTucted.
(43)  SD: V Y1" ' '?k  3 x \[P --~ Q\]ID: k x 3 YI"''Yk \[P & Q\]Instantiated for sentence (41) and its translation (44),the rule produces the expression in (457.

tr & deploy'(y)(x)(t') \]\](45) denotes the set of ships that have been deployedby some admiral.
This discourse entity with thatdescription then becomes available for the interpreta-tion of the pronoun they.It turns out that the method of constructing dis-course entities is not only relevant for the interpreta-tion of pronouns, but also for the contextual interpreta-tion of nouns and noun phrases that I am concernedwith here.The discourse entity with the description in (45)cannot only serve for interpreting pronouns, but alsofor instantiating the contextually specified variable Rfor the interpretation of the noun ship in (46b) in thecontext of (46a).
(46) a.
Did every admiral deploy a shipyesterday?b.
Which ships will arrive in Hawaii?Since the discourse entity in (457, which ranges over aset of ships, is described in terms of the property ofhaving been deployed by some admiral the day priorto the day of the speech point, that property can betaken to be salient in the discourse context.
If onesubstitutes the context variable R in the translation(47) of (46b) by this contextually salient property, thetemporal evaluation of the predicate ship' in the result-ing formula (48) is no longer governed by the existen-tial quantifier t for the future tense, but rather by thequantifier t' introduced by the contextually salientproperty.
As a consequence of this instantiation ofthe context variable R, the set of ships under con-sideration is restricted in the appropriate way.
whichare assumed to be bound by the discourse context.

6The mechanism for deriving contextually salientproperties which are introduced through the previouslinguistic discourse may strike the reader as rathercomplicated in detail.
However, as I have argued inthis sec~on, tracking such properties is important notonly for temporal evaluation, but is independentlymotivated by other discourse phenomena such asanaphoric reference, as Webber (1978,1983) hasconvincingly shown.7 A Compositional Syntax andSemantics of TenseIn the previous sections I have focused on thesemantic and pragmatic aspects of my analysis oftemporal expressions, that concern in particular thefeature of narrow scope assignment of tense and thefeature of context-dependent interpretation of quan-tified NP's.
In this section I will concentrate on mat-ters of syntax and will demonstrate how the narrowscope analysis of tense makes it possible to constructa straightforward compositional syntax and semanticsof temporal expressions.Syntactically tenses in English appear as inflec-tional morphemes on verbs.
In the notation ofcategorial grammar, I assign a syntactic tree as in(50) to sentence (49).
The untensed form of the verbarr/ve of category IV is combined with the past tensemorpheme -ed to form a tensed intransitive verb IV*.Morpho-syntactically, tenses are therefore items thatapply to individual words.
(49) Every ship arrived.eSee Hinrichs (1981) for more details on this point13(50) Zvez'lv =h?p a.c=:i.ved, SZvez.
'y shJ.p, 8/ZV* ="'?~.ved, ZV*Zvez'y, S/ZV~/CN =b.i.p, CN =.~=:~.vo, ZVSince I assign tense narrow scope in the semanticsand let temporal quantiflers bind only the temporalindex associated with the main verb, I arrive at ananalysis of tense where its syntactic domain coincideswith its semantic domain.
Compared to analyses inwhich tense is assigned wide scope over formulaswhich correspond to entire sentences (Montague1973) or over entire verb phrases (Bach 1980), thenarrow scope analysis, which I have developed in thispaper, has the advantage of leading to a straightfor-ward compositional syntax and semantics of tense.
Inthe syntax the tense morpheme turns an untensedverb into its tensed counterpart, while in the cor-responding translation rule tense has the effect of ex-istentially quantifying over the time-index of the predi-cate which translates the untensed verb.

The notation IV/nNP,thus, stands for an IV followed by n slashed NP's.The corresponding translation schema T17 denotes afunction from the type of meanings associated withobject NP's, if any, to functions from individuals totruth values.
Although these rule schemata are rathertechnical, their meaning should become clearer, whenone considers a concrete example.
Consider onceagain the example (53) whose syntax has been givenin (50).
(53) Every ship arrived.The translation of the entire sentence can be built upin a compositional fashion as in (54), which mirrorsthe syntactic composition of (50).
(54) arrived translates as:K x \[ =1 t' \[ t' < t s & t' ?

Notice that the context-variable R is introducedby the translation of the quantifier every.
The trans-lation of the entire sentence is formed by supplyingthe translation of the tensed verb arrived, which isproduced by the translation T17, to the translation ofthe subject NP.
The reduced translation results fromtwo steps of lambda-reduction.8 ConclusionIn this paper I have argued that a logical seman-tics for temporal expressions can provide adequaterepresentations for natural language input to an inter-face such as JANUS.
The temporal logic is based onReichenbach's models for the semantics of Englishtense and uses multiple indices for semantic inter-pretation.
This multi-indexed logic overcomes thekinds of problems that arise when systems of tenselogics are used that rely on just one index of evalua-tion.I have demonstrated how giving narrow scope totense quantifiers enables us to provide adequatescope relations with respect to NP quantifiers and tointerpret such NP's relative to a given discourse con-text.
I have argued that the context-dependent fea-ture of the analysis does not add extra complexity tomy treatment of time-dependent expressions, but isneeded for purposes of discourse understanding ingeneral.
Finally, I have demonstrated how the narrowscope of tense results in a fully compositional syntaxand semantics of tensed sentences in English.9 AcknowledgementsI am grateful to Remko Scha and Barry Schein forcomments on earlier drafts of this paper.
