de la biblioth~que, BP 53F-38041 Grenoble cedex 9, FranceChristian.Boitet @imag.frAbstractAfter 3 years of specifying the UNL (Universal Networking Language) language andprototyping deconverters I from more than 12 languages and enconverters for about 4, theUNL project has opened to the community by publishing the specifcations (v2.0) of the UNLlanguage, intended to encode the meaning of NL utterances as semantic hypergraphs and to beused as a "pivot" representation in multilingual information and communication systems.A UNL document is an html document with special tags to delimit the utterances and theirrendering in UNL and in all natural languages currently handled.
UNL can be viewed as thefuture "html of the linguistic content".
It is only an interface format, leading as well to the reuseof existing NLP components as to the development of original tools in a variety of possibleapplications, from automatic rough enconversion for information retrieval and informationgathering translation to partially interactive nconversion or deconversion for higher quality.We illustrate these points by describing an UNL-French deconverter organized as a specific"localizer" followed by a classical MT transfer and an existing generator.KeywordsUNL, interlingua, pivot, deconversion, UNL~French localization, transfer, generation.IntroductionThe UNL project of network-orientedmultilinguat communication has proposed astandard for encoding the meaning of naturallanguage utterances as semantic hypergraphsintended to be used as pivots in multilingualinformation and communication systems.
In thefirst phase (1997-1999), more than 16 partnersrepresenting 14 languages have worked to builddeconverters transforming an (interlingual)UNL hypergraph into a natural languageutterance.In this project, the strategy used to achieve thisinitial objective is free.
The UNL-Frenchdeconverter under development first performs a"localization" operation within the UNL format,and then classical transfer and generation steps,using the Ariane-G5 environment and someUNL-specifc tools.The use of classical transfer and generationsteps in the context of an interlingual projectmay sound surprising.
But it reflects manyinteresting issues about the status of the UNLlanguage, designed as an interlingua, butdiversely used as a linguistic pivot (disambi-guated abstract English), or as a purely semanticpivot.After introducing the UNL language, we presentthe architecture of the UNL-French deconverter,which "generates" from the UNL interlingua byfirst "localizing" the UNL form for French,within UNL, and then applying slightly adaptedbut classical transfer and generation techniques,implemented in the Ariane-G5 environlnent,supplemented by some UNL-specific tools.Then, we discuss the use of the UNL languageas a linguistic or semantic pivot for highlymultilingual information systems.1 The UNL project and language1.1 The projectUNL is a project of multilingual personalnetworking communication initiated by theUniversity of United Nations based in Tokyo.The pivot paradigm is used: the representationI The terms << deconvcrsion, and <~ enconvcrsion, are specific to tile UNL proiect and are defined at paragraph 2.768of an utterance in the UNL interlingua (UNLstands for "Universal Networking Language") isa hyl)ergraph where normal nodes bear UWsCUniversal Words", or interlingual acceptions)with semantic attributes, and arcs bear semanticrelations (deep cases, such as agt, obj, goal, etc.
).Hypernodes group a subgraph defined by a setof connected arcs.
A UW denotes a set ofinterlingual acceptions (word senses), althoughwe often loosely speak of "the" word sensedemoted by a UW.Because English is known by all UNLdevelopers, the syntax of a tlormal WW is:"<Engl ish word or compound> ( <listof res t r i c t ions> ) ", O.
Z.
"look for( icl>action, agt>human, obj>thing)"Going fronl a text to the corresponding "UNLtext" or interactively constructing a UNL text iscalled "enconversioif', while producing a textfiom a sequence of UNL graphs is called"deconversion".This departure fi'om the standard terms ofanalysis and generation is used to stress that thisis not a classical M\]: projecl, bu!
that UNL isplanned to be the source format preferred forrepresenting textual inl:ormation in tileenvisaged multilingual network environment.Tile schedule of tile project, beginning withdeconversion rather than cnconvcrsion, alsoreflects that difference.14 hmguages have been tackled during the first3--year phase of the prqject (1997-1999), whilemany more arc to be added in tile secondphase.
Each group is fi-ee to reuse its ownsoftware lools and/or lingware resources, or todevelop directly with tools provided by tileUNL Center (UNU/IAS).Emphasis is on a very large lexical coverage, sothat all groups spend most of their time on tileUNL-NL lexicons, and develop tools andmethods for efficient lexical development.
Bycontrast, gramnmrs have been initially limited tothose necessary for deconversion, and will thenbc gradually expanded to allow for morenaturalness m formulating text to beenconverted.1.2 The UNL components1.2.1 Universal WordsTile nodes of a UNL utterance are calledUniversal Words (or Uws).
The syntax of anormal UW consists of 2 parts :a headword,a list of  restrictionsBecause English is known by all UNLdevelopers, tile headword is an English word orcompound.
The restrictions are given as allattribute value pail" where attributes are semanticrelation labels (as the ones used in the graphs)and wllues are other UWs (restricted or not).A UW denotes a collection of interlingualacceptions (word senses), although we oftenloosely speak of "the" word sense denoted by anUW.
For example, the unrestricted UW " lookfor" denotes all the word-senses associated totile English compound word "look for".
Tilerestricted UW " look for ( ic l>action,agt>human, obj>thing) " represents all tileword senses of the English word "look fo r "that are an action, perl%rmed by a human thataffects a thing.
In this case this leads to the wordsense: "look fo r -  to try to find".1.2.2 UNL hypergraphA UNL expression is a hypergraph (a graphwhere a node is simple or recursively contains ahypergraph).
Tile arcs bear semantic relationlabels (deep cases, such as agt, obj, goal, etc.
).score(icl>event agt>human,tld>sport) \[ I @ entry.

In the UNL hmguagc, an769expression consists in a set of arcs, connectingthe different nodes.
As an example, the graphpresented in figure 1.1 will be denoted as:agt(score(...).@entry.@past.@complete,Ronaldo)obj(score(_.).@entry.@past.@complete,goal(icl>thing))ins(score(...)
.@entry.@past.@complete,head(pof>body))plt(score(...)
.@entry.@past.

Thegraph contained by a hypernode is denoted as aset of arcs colored by this number as in:agt (:Ol.

@entry)Entries of the graph and subgraphs are denotedwith the ".
@entry" attribute.2 Inside the French deconverter2.1 Overv iewDeconversion is the process of transforming aUNL graph into one (or possibly several)utterance in a natural language.
Any meansmay be used to achieve this task.
Many UNLproject partners use a specialized tool calledDeCo but, like several other partners, we chooseto use our own tools for this purpose.One reason is that DeCo realizes thedeconversion in one step, as in some transfer-based MT systems such as METAL \[17\].
Weprefer to use a more modular architecture andto split deconversion into 2 steps, transfer andgeneration, each divided into several phases,most of them written in Arlene-G5.Another reason for not using DeCo is that it isnot well suited for the morphological gene-ration of inflected languages (several thousandsrules are needed for Italian, tens of thousandsfor Russian, but only about 20 rules and 350affixes suffice to build an exhaustive GM forFrench in Sygmor).
Last, but not least, thischoice allows us to reuse modules alreadydeveloped for French generation.This strategy is illustrated by figure 2.1./~;~,; o_;.,,.~,', Transfer~ .

2.2: architecture of the French deconverter2.2  Trans fer2.2.1 ValidationWhen we receive a UNL Graph for decon-version, we first check it for correctness.
A UNLgraph has to be connected, and the differentfeatures handled by the nodes have to bedefined in UNL.If the graph proves incorrect, an explicit errormessage is sent back.
This validation has to beperformed to ilaprove robustness of thedeconverter, as there is no hypothesis on theway a graph is created.
When a graph provesvalid, it is accepted for deconversion.2.2.2 Loeal&ationIn order to be correctly deconverted, tile graphhas to be slightly modified.2.2.2.1 Lexical localizationSome lexical units used in the graph may not bepresent in the French deconversion dictionary.This problem may appear under differentcircumstances.
First, the French dictionary(which is still under development) may beincomplete.
Second, the UW nmy use anunknown notation to represent a known Frenchword sense, and third, the LAV may represent anon-French word sense.We solve these problems with the same method :Let w be a UWin  the graph G. Let D be theFrench dictionary (a set of UWs).
We substitutew in G by w' such that: w' e D andVxeD d(w, w', G) = d(w, x, G).
where d is apseudo-distance function.770If different French UWs are at the same pseudo-distance of w, w' is chosen at random amongthese UWs (default in non-interactive mode).2.2.2.2 "Cultural" localizationSome crucial information may be missing,depending on the language of the sourceutterance (sex, modality, number, determination,politeness, kinship...).It is in general impossible to solve this problemfully automatically in a perfect manner, as wedo not know anything about the document, itsc:ontext, and its intended usage: FAHQDC 2 is nomore possible than FAHQMT on arbitrary texts.We have to rely on necessarily imperfectheuristics.ttowever, we can specialize tile general Frenchdeconverter to produce specialized servers fordifferent tasks and different (target)sublanguages.
It is possible to assign prioritiesnot only to various parts of the dictionaries(e.g., specialized vs. general), but also toequivalents of the same UW within a givendictionary.
We can then define several userprofiles.
It is also possible to build a memory ofdeconverted and possibly postedited utterancesfor each specialized French deconversionserver.2.2.3 Lexical TransferAfter the localization phase, we have to performthe lexical transfer.
It would seem natural to doill within Ariane-G5, after converting the graphinto a tree.
But lexical transfer is context-sensitive, and we want to avoid the possibility oftransferring differently two tree nodescorresponding to one and the same graph node.Each graph node is replaced by a French lcxicalunit (LU), along with some variables.
A lexicalunit used in tile French dictionary denotes aderivational family (e.g.
in English: destroydenotes destroy, destruction, destructible,destructive .... in French: d6truire for d6truire,destruction, destructible, indestructible,destructif, destructeur).There may be several possible lexical units forone UW.
This happens when there is a realsynonymy or when different erms are used indifferent domains to denote the same wordsense  3.
In  that case, we currently choose tilelexical unit at random as we do not have anyinformation on tile task the deconverter is usedfor.Tile same problem also appears because of tileslrategy used to build the French dictionary.
Inorder to obtain a good coverage from thebeginning, we have underspecified tile UWs andlinked them to dift'ercnt lexical units.
This way,we considered a UW as tile denotation of a setof word senses in French.Hence, we were able to reuse previousdictionaries and we can use the dictionary evenif it is still under development and incolnplete.In our first version, we also solve this problemby a random selection of a lexical unit.2.2.4 Graph to tree conversionThe subsequent deconversion phases areperformed in Ariane-G5.
Hence, it is necessaryto convert he UNL hypergraph into an Ariane-G5 decorated tree.The UNL graph is directed.
Each arc is labelledby a semantic relation (agt, obj, ben, con...) andeach node is decorated by a UW and a set offeatures, or is a hypernode.
One node isdistinguished as the "entry" of the graph.An ARIANE tree is a general (non binary) treewith decorations on its nodes.
Each decorationis a set of wlriable-value pairs.The graph-to-tree conversion algorithln has tolnaintain the direction and labelling of thegraph along with the decoration ot' the nodes.Our algorithm splits tile nodes that are the targetof more than one arc, and reverses the directionof as few arcs as possible.
An example of such aconversion is shown in figure 2.3.!

We usean association list A = { (n,;,n.r) I ,,,+ ~ r,, U. r EN }, where we memorize the correspondencebetween nodes of the tree and nodes of thegraph.2 fully autonmtic high quality dcconvcrsion.3 strictly speaking, tile same collection of intcrlingualwoM senses (acccptions).771l e t  e(; e  such that e is the entry  of Ge r 6- new tree-node (ed, entry)inT  +- er ( ) ;  N 6- {e,r\]; A <-- {(ec;,eT)}whi le G :~ O doif there  is (a,b,l) in  G such  thatG ~- G \ (a ,b , l ) ;b r 6- new tree-node(b, i) ;A 6- A <J {(b,b,,));l e t  a, r e N such that  (a,a, r) e Ain  add b r to the daughters of a,r;else if there  is (a,b,l) in G such  that  (b,br) 6G e- G \ (a ,b , l ) ;a T ( -new tree-node(a, l  i);A <--- A U {(a ,a .

During this phase, decisions are takenregarding the derivation applied to each lexicalunit in order to obtain the correct syntaglnaticcategory for each node.
During this phase, theorder of appearance and the syntactic functionsof each parts of the utterance is also decided.The resulting structure is called UniqueMultilevel Abstract (UMA) structure.2.3.2 Syntactic and morphological generationThe UMA structure is still lacking the syntacticsugar used in French to realize the choicesmade in the previous phase by generatingarticles, auxiliaries, and non connectedcompunds uch as ne...pas, etc.The role of this phase is to create a UniqueMultilevel Concrete (UMC) structure.
Byconcrete, we mean that the structure ~sprojective, hence the corresponding French textmay be obtained by a standard left to righttraversal of the leaves and simple morphologicaland graphemic rules.
The result of these phasesis a surface French utterance.3 Different uses of the UNL language3.1 Hypergraphs  vs colored graphsAs presented in section 1.2.3, the syntax of theUNL language is based on the description of agraph, arc by arc.
Some of these arcs are"coloured" by a number.
This colouring iscurrently interpreted as hypernodes (nodescontaining a graph, rather than a classical UW).This interpretation is arbitrary and imposessemantic onstraints on a UNL utterance:the subgraph (the set of arcs labeled withthe same colour) is connected,arcs with different colours cannot beconnected to the same node.However, even if one uses the UNL languagefor a particular kind of application, a differentinterpretation may be chosen.
By adding newsemantic constraints to UNL expressions, onemay restrict o the use of trees.
On the contrary,by loosening semantic onstraint, one may usecolored graphs instead of the more restrictivehypergraphs.This flexibility of UNL may lead to uses thatdiffer from the computer science point of view(different structures leading to different kindsof methods and applications) as well as from thelinguistic point of view (different ways torepresent the linguistic content of a utterance).This kind of structure is very useful to representsome utterances like "Christian pulls Gilles'leg".
Using a colored graph, one can representthe utterance with the graph shown in figure3.1, which is not a hypergraph.77201 .

However, itdoes not restrict the choice of the data to beencoded.Since tile beginning, two possible and wflidapl~roaches has been mentioned.
During thekickoff meeting of tile UNL prelect, Pr.
Tsujiiprolnoted the use of UNL as a linguistic pivot.With this approach, a UNL utterance should bethe encoding of the deep structure of a validEnglish utterance that reflects the meaning ofthe source utterance.
With this approach, theGerman sentence "Hans schwimt sehr gern"should be encoded as shown in figure 3.3.agt.. _ - like.

With thissecond approach, the same sentence should beencoded as shown in figure 3.4.agt /zswim.l@entry/ / /  I ~ imanH wil~lglyl inedFigure 3.4: a semantic encoding of "ltans schwimt sehrgem"Each approach has its advantages anddrawbacks and the choice between them canonly be made with an application in mind.
Thelinguistic approach leads to a better quality illthe produced results and is an answer to highlymultilingual machine translation projects.
Withthis approach, the UNL graphs can only beproduced by people mastering English or by(partially) automatic enconverters.With the semantic approach, subtle differencesin source utterances (indefinite, reflexivity...)can not be expressed, leading to a lower quality.However, using this approach, the UNLencoding is much more natural and easy toperform by a non English speaker (as thesemantic relations and UWs are expressed at thesource level).
Hence, this approach is to be usedfor multilingual casual communication whereusers may express themselves by directlyencoding UNL expressions with an appropriateediting tool.Conc lus ionWorking oil tile French deconvel-ter has led toim interestiug architecture where deconversion,in principle a "generation from interlingua", isimplemented as transfer + generation from allabstract structure (UNL hypergraph) producedfrom a NL utterance.
The idea to use UNL fordirectly creating documents gets here anindirect and perhaps paradoxical support,although it is clear that considerable progressand innovative interface design will be neededto make it practical.However, the UNL language proves flexibleenough to be used by very different proiects.Moreover, with deconverters currentlydeveloped for 14 languages, joining the UNLproject is really attractive.
Let's hope that thiseffort will help breaking the language barriers.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank the sponsors of the UNLproject, especially UNU/IAS (T.
