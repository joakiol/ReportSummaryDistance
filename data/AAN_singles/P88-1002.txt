Box 517Paoli, PAABSTRACTThis paper describes an analysis of telegraphicfragments as regular structures (not errors) han-dled by rn~n~nal extensions to a system designedfor processing the standard language.
The modu-lar approach which has been implemented in theUnlsys natural anguage processing system PUNDITis based on a division of labor in which syntaxregulates the occurrence and distribution ofelided elements, and semantics and pragumticsuse the system's tandard mechankms to inter-pret them.1.
INTRODUCTIONIn t \ ]~  paper we discuss the syntactic,semantic, and pragmatic analysis of fragmentarysentences in English.
Our central claim is thatthese sentences, which have often been classifiedin the literature with truly erroneous input suchas misspellings (see, for example, the work dis-cussed in ~wnsny1980, Thompson1980,Kwnsny1981, Sondheimer1983, Eustman1981, Jen-sen1983\]), are regular structures which can beprocessed by adding a small number of rules tothe grammar and other components of the sys-tem.
The syntactic regularity of fragment struc-tures has been demonstrated elsewhere, notablyin ~/larsh1983, Hirschman1983\]; we will focus hereupon the regularity of these structures across alllevels of linguistic representation.
Because thesyntactic component regularizes these structuresinto a form almost indistinguishable from fulltThis work has been supported in part by DARPAunder contract N00014-85-C-0012, administered bythe Officeof Naval Research; by National Science Foundation contractDCR-85-02205; and by Independent R~D fuudinz from Sys-tens Development Corporation, ow part of Unisys Corpora-tion.
Approved for public release, distribution unlimited.assertions, the semantic and pragmatic com-ponents are able to interpret hem with few or noextensions to existing mechanisms.
This processof incremental regularisation of fragment struc-tures~is possible only within a linguistically modu-lar system.
Furthermore, we claim that althoughfra~nents may occur more frequently in special-ised sublanguages than in the standard grammar,they do not provide evidence that sublanguagesare based on gra,~m*tical principles fundamen-tally different from those underlying standardlanguages, as claimed by ~itspatrick1986\], forexample.This paper is divided into five sections.
Theintroductory section defines fragments anddescribes the scope of our work.
In the secondsection, we consider certain properties of sentencefragments which motivate a modular approach.The third section describes our implementation ofprocessing for fragments, to which each com-ponent of the system makes a distinct contribu-tion.
The fourth section describes the temporalanalysis of fragments.
Finally, the fifth sectiondiscusses the status of sublanguages characterizedby these telegraphic constructions.We define fragments as regular structureswhich are distinguished from full assertions by amissing element or elements which are normallysyntactically obligatory.
We distinguish themfrom errors on the basis of their regularity andconsistency of interpretation, and because theyappear to be generated intentionally.
We are notdenying the existence of true errors, nor that pro-ceasing sentences containing true errors mayrequire sophisticated techniques and deep reason-ing.
Rather, we are saying that fragments are dis-tinct from errors, and can be handled in a quitegeneral fashion, with minimal extensions to nor-mal processing.
Because we base the definition of/ragmer, t on the absence of a syntactically7obligatory element, noun phrases without articlesare not considered to be fragmentary, since thisom;~sion is conditioned heavily by sem?ntlc fac-tors such ?s the mass vs. count distinction.
How-ever, we have implemented a pr?gm?tlcaliy basedtreatment of noun phrases without determiners,which is briefly discussed in Section 3.Fragments, then, ?re defined here as eli-slons.
We describe below the way in which theseore;?
?ions are detected and subsequently 'filled in'by different modules of the system.The problem of processing fragmentary sen-tences has arisen in the context of a l?rge-scnlenatural language processing research project con-ducted at UNIsYs over the past five years ~al-mer1986, Hirschman1986, Dowding1987,Dahl1987\].
We have developed a portable,broad-coverage text-processing system, PUNDIT.
1Our initial applications have involved v?rlonsmessage types, including: field engineering reportsfor maintenance of computers; Navy maintenancereports (Casualty Reports, or CASR~S) for start-ing air compressors; Navy intelligence reports(~m~roRm); trouble and f ?U~ reports (TEas)from Navy Vessels; and recently we have exam-ined several medical domains (radiology reports,COmments fields from ?
DNA sequence database).At least half the sentences in these corpora arefragments; Table 1 below gives ?
summary of thefragment content of three domains, showing thepercent of centers  which are classified as frag-ments.

DIVIS ION OF LABOR AMONG SYN-TAX,  SEMANTICS ,  AND PRAGMATICSWe argue here that sentence fragments pro-vide a strong case for linguistically modular sys-tems such as PUNDIT, because such elislons havedistinct consequences ?
t  different levels of linguis-tic description.
Our approach to fragments can besnmm?rlsed by saying that syntax detects 'holes'in surface structure and creates dummy elementsas piaceholders for the missing elements; seman-tics and pragmatics interpret these placeholdersat the appropriate point in sentence processing,utllising the same mechanisms for fragments ?sfor full assertions.Syntax  regulates  the  holes.
FragmenteUsions cannot be accounted for in purelysemantlc/pragmatic erms.
This is evidenced bythe fact that  there ?re syntactic restrictions onom;nlons; the acceptability of a sentence frag-ment hinges on gramm?tlcal factors rather than,e.g., how readily the elided material can beinferred from context.
For example, the discourseOld howe too small.
*New one ~ be larger titan_ was (where the elided object of t~an is under-stood to be old howe) is Ul-formed, whereas acomparable discourse First repairman ordered newair eonditiom~r.
Second repairman will in l ta l i _(where the elided object of inJto//is understood tobe air eoaditloasr) is acceptable.
In both casesabove, the referent of the elided element is avail-able from context, and yet only the second elilpsissounds well-formed.
Thus ?n appreciation ofwhere such ellipses may occur is part of thel ingu, t/e knowledge of speakers of English andnot simply a function of the contextual salienceof elided elements.
Since these restrictions con-cern structure rather than content, they would bed;~cult or impossible to state in ?
system such ?sa 'pure' semantic grammar which only recognisedsuch omissions at the level of semantic/pragmaticrepresentation.Furthermore, it matters to semantics andpragmatic?
HOW an argument is omitted.
Thesyntactic omponent must tell sem?ntlcs whethera verb argument is re;Ring bec?use the verb isused intransitively (as in The tiger was eating,where the patient argument is not specified) orbecause of ?
fragment ellipsis (as in Eaten bl/ atiger, where the patient argument is missingbecause the subject of a passive sentence hasbeen elided).
Only in the latter case does themissing argument of eat function ?s ?nantecedent subsequently in the discourse: compareEaten by a tiler.
Had mcreamed bloody murderright before tKe attack (where the victim and thescreamer are the same) vs. TKe tiger teas eating.Had screamed bloody murder right before tKeattack (where it is dlmcnlt or impossible to get thereading in which the victim and the screamer arethe same).Semant les  and  pragmst les  fill the  holes.In PUNDIT's treatment of fragments, each com-ponent contributes exactly what is appropriate tothe specification of elided elements.
Thus the syn-tax does not attempt o 'fill in' the holes that itdiscovers, unless that  information is completelypredictable given the structure at hand.
Instead,it creates ?
dummy element.
If the missing ele-ment is an elided subject, then the dummy ele-ment created by the syntactic component isassigned a referent by the pragmatics component.This referent is then assigned ?
thematic role bythe semantics component llke any other referent,and is subject to any selectlonal restrictions atom-cinted with the thematic role assigned to it.
Ifthe missing element is a verb, it is specified ineither the syntactic or the semantic component,depending upon the fragment ype.| .
PROCESSING FRAGMENTS IN  PUN-D ITAlthough the initial PUNDIT system wudesigned to handle full, as opposed to fragmen-tary,  sentences, one of the interesting results ofour work is that  it has required only very minorchanges to the system to handle the basic frag-ment types introduced below.
These included theadditions of: 6 fragment BNF definitions to thegrammar (a 5~ increase in grammar size) and 7context-sensitive r strictions (a 12~o increase inthe number of restrictions); one semantic rule forthe interpret?
?
ion of the dummy element insertedfor missing verbs; ?
minor modification to thereference resolution mechanism to treat elidednoun phrases llke pronouns; and a small additionto the temporal processing mechanism to handletenseless fragments.
The small number ofchanges to the semantic and pragmatic com-ponents reflects the fact that these componentsare not 'aware'  that they are interpreting frag-mentary structures, because the regularlsatlonperformed by the syntactic component rendersthem structurally indistinguishable from fullassertions.Fragments present parsing problems becausethe ellipsis creates degenerate structures.
Forexample, ?
sequence such as cheer negative canbe analysed as a 'sero-copuia' fragment meaningthe chest X-ray im negative, or ?
noun compoundllke tKe nefative of the ehe,L This is compoundedby the lack of deriv?tional and inflectional mor-phology in English, so that in many cases it maynot be possible to distinguish ?
noun from ?
verb(repair parts) or a past tense from a past partici-ple (decreased medication).
Adding fragmentdefinitions to the grammar (especially if deter-miner om;Mion is ?\]so allowed) results in ?nexplosion of ambiguity.
This problem has beennoted and discussed by Kwasny and Sondheimer~wasny1981\].
Their solution to the problem isto suggest special relax??
ion techniques for theanalysis of fragments.
However, in keeping withour thesis that fragments are normal construc-tions, we have chosen the alternative of con-straining the explosion of parses in two ways.The first is the addition of ?
control structure toimplement a i;m;ted form of preference via'unbacktr ?ckable'  or (xor).
This binary operatortries its second argument only if its first argu-ment does not lead to ?
parse.
In the grammar,this is used to prefer "the most structured" alter-native.
That  is, full assertions are preferred overfragments - if an assertion or other non-fragmentparse is obtained, the parser does not try for ?fragment parse.The second mechanism that helps to controlgeneration of incorrect parses is selection.
PUNDITapplies surface selectlonal constraints incremen-tally, as the parse is built up ~ang1988\].
Forexample, the phrase air compressor would NOT beallowed as ?
serocopnla because the constructionair is eompree#or would fall selection, s8.1.
F ragment  TypesThe fragment types currently treated inPUNDIT include the following:Zerocopula:  a subject followed by ?
predicate,differing from a full clause only in the absence of?
verb, as in ImpeUor blade tip erosion eviden~Tvo  (tensed verb + object): a sentence m;~ing itssubject, as in Believe the coupling from diesel tolac lube oil pump to be reheated;s Similarly, the assertion parse for the title of this pa-per would fail selection (sentences don't frngment structures),permitting the serocopuin fragment pLrse.Nst~.ag:  an isolated noun phrase (noun-stringfragment), as in Lou  o/o~ primp preuure.ObJlze_frag (object-of-be fragment): an isolatedcomplement appropriate to the main verb be, asin Unable to eonJ.tenffy Itart nr lb gaa turbine;P red icate :  an isolated complement appropriateto a~ary  be, as in Believed due to worn b~h-ingJ, where the full sentence counterpart isFailure 14 believed (to be) due to uorn b~hlnfm; sObj..gap_flea&qnent: a center (assertion, ques-tion, or other fragment structure) mining an obli-gatory noun phrase object, as in Field engineert~ l  replace_Note that we do not address here the pro-cessing of reapon~e frafmen~ which occur ininteractive discourse, typically as responses toquestions.The relative frequency of these six fragmenttypes (expressed as a percentage of the total frag-ment content of each corpus) is summarisedbelow.'Ta~e2.

At this level, fragments bear very littleresemblance to full assertions.
But at the level ofthe Intermediate S~/ntac~e Representation (ISR),s It is interesting to note that  at least some of thesetypes of fragments resemble non-frnsmentary structures inother languages, two fragments, for m--Lmple, can be com-pared to sero-subject sentences in Japanese, seroeopu lasresemble copular sentences in Arabic and Russian, and strue-tures similar to p red lcate  can be found in Cantonese (ourthanks to K.

The CONTENT of these dummy elements,however, is left unspecified in most cases, to befilled in by the semantic or pragmatic omponentsof the system.Tvo .
We consider first the tvo,  a subject-less tensed clause such as Operate, norton/Ill.
Thisis parsed as a sequence of tensed verb and object:no subject is inferred at the level of surface struc-ture.
In the ISR, the missing subject is fined in bythe dnmmy element elided.
At the level of theISR, then, the fragment operates norma/f~/ differsfrom a full assertion such as \]t operates normaU~/only by virtue of the element el ided in place ofsn overt pronoun.
The element el ided is asslgneda referent which subsequently fills a thematicrole, exactly as if it were a pronoun; thus thesetwo sentences get the same treatment fromsemantics and reference resolutlon~)ah11986, Pal-mer1988\].Elided subjects in the domains we havelooked at often refer to the writer of the report,so one strategy for interpreting them might besimply to assume that the filler of the elided sub-Sect is the writer of the report.
This simple stra-tegy is not snlBclent in all cases.
For example, inthe CASREPS corpus we observe sequences suchas the following, where the filler of the elided sub-Sect is provided by the previous sentence, and isclearly not the writer of the report.
(i) Problem appears to be caused by one ormore of two hydraulic valves.
Requiresdisassembly and investigation.
(2) Sac lube oll pressure decreases below alarmpoint approximately seven minutes afterengagement.
Believed due to worn bushings.Thus, it is necessary to be able to treat elidedsubjects as pronouns in order to handle these sen-tences.The effect of an elided subject on subse-quent focusing is the same as that of an overtpronoun.
We demonstrated in section 2 thatelided subjects, but not semantically implicitarguments, are expected loci (or forward-looklngcenters \[Gross1988\]) for later sentences.10The basic assumption underlying this treat-ment is that  the pragmatic analysis for elidedsubjects should be as re;re;far to that  of pronounsas possible.
One piece of supporting evidence forthis assumption is that  in many languages, suchas Japanese \[Gundel1980, l-nnds1983,Kameyama1985\] the functional equivalent ofunstressed pronouns in English is a sere, or elidednoun phrase, s If seres in other languages cancorrespond to unstressed pronouns in English,then we hypothesise that  seres in a sublunguageof English can correspond functionally to pro-nouns in standard English.
In addition, since pro-ceasing of pronouns is independently motlvated, itis a priori simpler to try to fit elision Into the pro-nominal paradigm, if possible, than to create anentirely separate component for handling elision.Under this hypothesis, then, tvo  fragmentsrepresent 8~ply  a realization of a grammaticalstrategy that  is generally available to languagesof the world, sZeroeopula .
For a serocopuia (e.g., D~Jkbad), the surface parse tree rather than the ISRinserts a dnmmy verb, In order to enforce sub-categorization constraints on the object.
And Inthe ISR, this null verb is 'filled in' as the verb be.It is possible to fill in the verb at this levelbecause no further semantic or pragmatic infor-mation is required in order to determ;ne its con-tent.
7 Hence the representation for D~k bad isnearly indistinguishable from that assigned to thecorresponding/) / Ik/s  bad; the only difference is inthe absence of tense from the former.
If the nullverb represents an~llsLry be, then, like an overtan~I;ary, it does not appear in the regularisedform.
Sac .failing thus receives a regularisatlonwith /ai/ as the main verb.
Thus the null verbinserted in the syntax is treated in the ISR ill afashion exactly parallel to the treatment of overtt Stressed pronouns in Eugiish corrupond to overt pro-nouns in lanzua,res like Japanese.
u discummd in \[Gun-dell980, Gundellg81J, and \[Dahl1982J.t An interesting hypothesis, discussed by Gundel andKameyama, is that the more topic prominent a language is,the more likely it is to have sero-NP's.
Perhaps the fact thatsublangusge mumn~J are characterised by rigid, contextualiysupplied, topics contributes to the availability of the ryefragment type in English.7 In some restricted subdomains, however, other verbsmay be omitted: for example, in certain radiology reports anomitted verb may be interpreted u ,hew rather than be.Hence we find Chemf Fdm* 1/.10 tittle cAa~e,  paraphruab le  asChe#t .Fdme show Htffe cA~sge.occurrences of 6c.Nstg - .~ag.
The syntactic parse tree forthis fragment ype contains no empty elements; itis a regular noun phrase, labeled as annstg_f~aK.
The ISR transforms it into a VSOsequence.
This is done by treating it as the sub-Sect of an element empty_verb ;  in the semanticcomponent, he subject of empty_verb  is treatedas the sole argument of a predicateexlstent ls l (X) .
As a result, the nstg_ f ragFai/ure o\[ see and a synonymous assertion such asFailure o.f sac occurred are eventually mappedonto s;rnil~r final representations by virtue of thetemporal semantics o f  empty_verb  and of thebead of the noun phrase.Objbe_/~ag and pred icate .
These are iso-inted complements; the same devices describedabove are utillsed in their processing.
The sur-face parse tree of these fragment ypes containsno empty elements; as with seroeopula ,  theunteused verb be is inserted into the ISR; as withtvo,  the dnr-my subject el ided is also inserted inthe ISR, to be filled in by reference resolution.Thus the simple adjective Inoperatiee will receivean ISR quite s;rn;lsr to that of .~e/,Ise/it ~ ino-perative.ObJ_gap_~agment .
The final fragmenttype to be considered here is the elided nounphrase object.
Such object elisioca occur morewidely in English in the context of instructions, asin Handle _ udtA sere.
Cookbooks are especiallywell-known respositories of elided objects, presum-ably because they are filled with instructions.Object elision also occurs in telegrarnmatic sub-languages generally, as in Took _ under  .~re ud~m,e~es from the Navy sighting messages.
If theseomissions occurred only in direct object positionfollowing the verb, one might argue for a lexlcaltreatment; that  is, such omissions could betreated as a lexlcal process of intransitivisationrather than by explicitly representing gaps in thesyntactic structure.
However, noun phrase objectsof prepositions may also be omitted, as in FraCas.Do not tamper ~th  _.
Thus we have chosen torepresent such elislons with an explicit surfacestructure gap.
This gap is permitted in most con-texts where nstKo (noun phrase object) is found:as a direct object of the verb and as an object ofa preposition.
8 In PUNDIT, elided objects ares Note,  however ,  that  there  are  some rest r ic t ions  on theoccur rence  of  these elements.
They  seem not  to  occur  in11permitted only in a fragment type calledobj_gap_fkagment ,  which, llke other fragmenttypes, may be attempted only if an assertionparse has failed.
Thus a sentence such as Pressurewas c/stressing rap~ffy will never be analysed ascontaining an elided object, because there is asemantically acceptable assertion parse.
In con-trust, Johts ~as deere~inf gr~uag\[I/ will receivean elided object analysis, paraphrasable as Joh~w~ deere~i~f IT  gradua~v, because Jo~n is notan acceptable subject of intransitive Jeere~e;only pressure or some equally mensurable ntitymay be said to decrease.
This selectional failureof the assertion parse permits the elided objectanalysis.Our working hypothesis for determ;u;uS thereference of object gaps is that they are, just llkesubject gaps, appropriately treated as pronouns.However, we have not as yet seen extensive datarelevant o this hypothesis, and it remains ubjectto further testing.These, then, are the fragment typescurrently Inzplemented In PUNDIT.
As mentionedabove, we do not consider noun phrases withoutdeterm;-ers to be fragments, because it is notclear that the missing element is symf~f~e~yobligatory.
The Interpretation of these nounphrases is treated as a pragmatic problem.
In thestyle of speech characteristic of the CASREPs,determ;uers are nearly always omitted.
Theirfunction must therefore be replaced by othermechanisms.
One possible approach to this prob-lem would be to have the system try to determinewhat the determ;uer would have been, had therebeen one, insert it, and then resume processing asif the detervn;ner had been there all along.
Thisapproach was taken by ~V\[arsh1981\].
However,it was rejected here for two reasons.
The first isthat it was judged to be more error-prone thansimply equipping the reference resolution com-ponent with the ability to handle noun phraseswithout determiners directly.
0 The second reasonpredicative objects, in double dative constructions, and,perhaps, in sentence adjuncts rather than arguments of theverb.
(Thus compare P4fiesf eertf d/..Do sot opersfe oswith Opersti~ room cloud os Snadslt.
Do nor pe~om ~r-gcIT oz..) One po~ibility is that these xpreruione can occuronly where a definite pronoun would also be acceptable.
Ingeneral, object pps seem mcet acceptable where theyrepresent an argument ot n verb, either as direct object or uobject of a preposition selected for by a verb.This ability would be required in any case, should thesystem be extended to process languages which do not havefor not selecting this approach is that it wouldel|m;uate the distinction between noun phraseswhich originally had a determiner and thosewhich did not.
At some point in the developmentof the system it may become necessary to use thisinformation?The basic approach currently taken is toassume that the noun phrase is definite, that is, ittriggers a search through the discourse contextfor a previously mentioned referent.
If the searchsucceeds, the noun phrase is assumed to refer tothat entity.
If the search fans, z new discourseentity is created.In summary, then, these fragment ypes areparsed 'as is' at the surface level; dummy ele-ments are inserted Into the ISR to bring fragmentsinto close parallelism with fuil assertions.Because of the resulting structural s;m;l~rltybetween these two sentence types, the semanticand pragmatic omponents can apply exactly thesame Interpretive processes to both fragmentsand assertions, using preexisting mechanisms to'flu In' the holes detected by syntax.4.
TEMPORAL ANALYS IS  OF F I~G-MENTSTemporal processing of fragmentary sen-tences further supports the efficacy of a modularapproach to the analysis of these strings.

InPUNDIT'S current message domains, a singleassumption leads to assignment of present or pasttense in untensed fragments, depending on thenspectual properties of the fragment, lz Thisassumption is that the messages report on actualsituations which are of present  relevance.

RELAT ION OF FRAGMENTS TO THELARGER G ~An important finding which has emergedfrom the investigation of sentence fragments in avariety of sublanguage domains is that thelinguistic properties of these constructions arelargely domain-independent.
A~nrn|rlg that thesesentence fragments remain constant acrossdifferent sublanguages, what is their relationshipto the language at large?
As indicated above, weIs Mourelat~' class of occurrences \[Mourelatoslg81\].believe that fragments hould not be regarded asERRORS, ?
position taken also by ~ehrberger1982,Marsh1983\], and others.
Fragments do occurwith disproportionate frequency in some domains,such as field reports of mechanical failure ornewspaper headlines.
However, despite this fre-quency v?r iatlon, it appears that  the parser'spreferences remain constant ?cross domains.Therefore, even in telegraphic domains the prefer-ence is for ?
full assertion parse, if one is avail-able.
As discussed above, we have enforced thispreference by means of the xor  ('unbacktrack-able' or) connective.
Thus despite the greaterfrequency of fragments we do not require either ?gr ?mm*r or ?
preference structure different fromthat of standard English in order to apply thestable system ~rammlr  to these telegraphic mes-sages.Others have argued against this view of therelationship between sublanguages and thelanguage at large.
For example, Fitspatrlck et al~itspatrick1986\] propose that fragments are sub-ject to ?
constraint quite unlike any found inEnglish generally.
Their T r*n* l t l v i ty  Con-s t ra in t  (TC) requires that  if ?
verb occurs as ?transitive in ?
sublanguage with fragmentarymessages, then it may not also occur in an intran-sitive form, even if the verb is ambiguous in thelanguage at large.
This constraint, they argue,provides evidence that  sublanguage gramm,,rshave " ?
llfe of their own", since there is no suchprinciple governing standard languages.
The TCwou ld  also cut down on ambiguities arising outof object deletion, since ?
verb would be permit-ted to occur transitively or intransltlve\]y in ?given subdomain, but not both.As the authors recogulse, this hypothesisruns into tllt~culty in the face of verbs such asresume (we find both Sac resumed norm~ opera-tlon and No~e \]~am resumed), since resume occursboth transitively and intransitively in these cases.For these cases, the authors are forced to appealto a problematic analysis of resume as syntacti-caliy transitive in both cases; they analyse TKe~o~e /sue resumed, for example, as deriving froma structure of the form CSomeone/aomethingJresumed tKc nose; that is, it is analysed as under-lyingiy transitive.
Other transitivity alternationswhich present potential counter-examples aretreated as syntactic gapping processes.
In fact,with these two mechanisms available, it is notclear what COULD provide a counter-example to13the TC.
The effect of all this insulation is torender the Transitivity Constraint vacuous.
If alltrans|tive/intranslt|ve alt rnations can be treatedas underlying|y transitive, then of course therewin be no counter-examples to the transitivityconstraint.
Therefore we see no evidence thatsublanguage grammars are subject to additionalconstraints of this nature.In snmm*ry, this supports the view thatfragmentary constructions in English are regular,gramm~t|caliy constrained ellipses differingminimally from the standard language, ratherthan ill-formed, unpredictable sublanguage exo-tlca.
