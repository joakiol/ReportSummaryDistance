Argumentation Mark-Up: A ProposalJean-Franqois DelannoyRES International nd University of Ottawa, Ottawa, CanadaAbstractThis is a proposal for a an XML mark-up of argumentation.
The annotation can be used to help the reader (e.g.
by means ofselective highlighting or diagramming), and for further processing (summarization, critique, use in information retrieval).The article proposes a set of markers derived from manual corpus annotation, exemplifies their use, describes a way toassign them using surface cues and limited syntax for scoping, and suggests further directions, including an acquisition tool,the application of machine learning, and a collaborative DTD definition task.1.
IntroductionComputational linguistics has had a long interest indiscourse representation, but generally on the structure ofmonologue or dialogue rather than on content analysis,rhetoric, or argumentation proper.
There is an increasingamount of work on mark-up, that is, indicating locally inthe text the linguistic information - rather than in someknowledge-representation formalism.
Mark-up can bedesigned for the reader, for a browser (in charge ofdisplaying the information according to some template), orfor further processing (a summarizer, a semantic analyzer,a reasoning system) - or a combination of these.1.1.
Reading aidsActive reading involves a task of text mapping, selecting,anchoring and short-term memorization, all the moretaxing when reading a scarcely-formatted text.
Speedreading techniques (Judson & Schaill 73) address in factnot only speed per se, but also efficient informationextraction and critiquing.
(Note: I am much in favour ofgiving speed reading more recognition -- and I evenpractice it live in a live radio program on literature, toquickly select passages.).
More people have to read moretext, and often this cannot be done in integral readingmode (cf.
the idea, in Carver 90, of "gear shifts" betweensix reading modes).
Highlighting helps reading, as seen incommon experience (also see numerous references inOstler 98).
With a rich and appropriate annotation, thereader has a better idea of what is important in some givenrespect, and retention is better.
Then, it may well be usefulto 1) develop a powerful reader-oriented annotationsystem, and 2) implement automatic highlighting orinteractive assisted annotation.Those heavy readers can be helped more appropriately bysummaries, highlighting, hypertext, etc.
All try tofacilitate access and use, by helping selective perceptionand interpretation.
One should allow at least multipleviews of a text.
There is a qualitative difference of thefinesse of understanding if one can manipulate text, oraccess  essential information (Cremmins 82, Jewinsky 90),possibly an order of magnitude faster.
Those points wereaddressed in a May 1999 colloquium organized by thisauthor (Delannoy 99).1.2.
Processing, modularity, andinterchangeCorpus annotation has largely addressed text structure andcategorial tagging, but until very recently has been leavingout most linguistic annotation: lexical (word-sensedisambiguation), syntactic, sentence semantic, passagesemantics.
A mark-up standard would facilitate modularprocessing and interchange among teams working onargumentation.1.3 Other work on argumentationThere does not seem to be focused work on argumentationannotation, as distinguished from dialogue structures.Moulin 95 uses speech acts, but does not discussargumentation structure and validity.The Global Document Annotation initiative (GDA), asmall-team Japanese-German effort to develop a wide setof tags; it treats argumentation marginally, with half adozen causality relations: cause, reason, motivation,purpose, concession, contrast ....
This is rather similar, infact, to Fillmore-inspired verbal cases, as those used in theclause-level analysis part of Barker et al 98b.The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) will soon bebroadening its scope, so far mostly concerned with textstructure, but has not circulated concrete proposals yet ondiscourse.The encoding schemes DR/and Mate do not consider thequestion.182.
Argumentation analysisI focus on argumentation, which is, in a way, thearticulation of discourse and content analyses.Argumentation analysis is particularly represented incritical reading (of news, editorials, politicalcommuniques, other people's analyses on politics oreconomics, and legal interpretation).Argumentation is often not to be treated in a narrowpredicate-logic framework.
It is better account by Toulminet al 84 (using a combination of warrants and evidence toreach a conclusion) rather than, for example, Groarke et al97 (with classical predicate logic, and treating induction asa marginal case).
In fact, a lot of everyday argumentationis based on induction from models left implicit, rather thandeduction from clearly shared models.
One tag,<FRAMEOFREF> addresses analogical or newly createdmodels used in a belief/construction.In sum, the purpose of a semi-automatic tracking andanalysis of argumentation i cludes the following:synthesizing claimsclarifying claims in association with the relevantevidence and warrantslisting the actors' position on an issue (pro, contra)pinpointing terminological conflictsvisualizing underlying models of the domainsingling out non-demonstrative rhetorical effects- coherence checkingcomparing alternatives (some argument can beshown to be better than others, in absolute or for agiven knowledge base)a critique of argumentative rhetorical devices,including fallacies.3.
The current tag set3.1.
IntroductionThe current system of tags is inspired by RST and works on reasoning like Toulmin et al 84 or Walton 96. and frommanual experiment.The four classes of tags are:1.
Reasoning and rhetoric2.
Modelling: description of the world; actors3.
Textual and narrative4.
EvaluativeClasses 1, 2 and 4 are the most characteristic of our focus on argument; class 3 serves to accommodate xt flow, inasmuchas it is pertinent to the development of an argument.Class 4 tags are assigned by the user, or, in part, by a semantic analyzer + reasoning system if available.Remarks:<ID> and <REF> can be added to any tag to handle inter-segment reference.<ACTOR> is used to tag an entity, and so plays a directly semantic role, besides its interplay in the discourse analysis.Text type: political analysis.

Description, evaluation, and scenario.Original textIf  they ever doubted it, Venezuela's political elite now know who's boss: President Hugo Chavez.
He promised uring hiselection campaign to end their hold on power.
He has now taken two giant steps toward doing so - and replacing it with hisown.
First, the president cowed Congress into granting him nearly all the powers that he had demanded to enact economicand financial legislation by decree.
Then, on April 24th, a referendum gave him a huge majority for the creation of  a newassembly to rewrite the constitution.The former paratroop colonel, dismissesd in the early days of  his challenge for power as a political neophyte, has now putthe sophisticates rudely in their place.
He has also shown up the weakness of  the two big traditional parties.
Crushed in thepresidential election, they are still groping for a strategy to counter Mr Chavez and his alleged dictatorial tendencies, andwho no sign so far of finding one.Still more so \[i.e.
a victory\], in its likely effects, was the backing Mr Chavez won for the creation of  a new constituentassembly.
The turnout, admittedly, was only 39%.
But, of  those who did bother to vote, over 90% backed his proposal.
The21country's 1961 constitution, he claims, has only perpetuated the rule of the elite in a sham democracy.
The new assembly isto be elected - on non-party lines - in late June, and is meant o have a constitution ready by early January for approval byreferendum later that month.The assembly will no doubt shake up the structures of government- not least, probably, in allowing a president the twoconsecutive t rms that Mr Chavez seeks.
Whether he can earn and win re-election it is far too early to say.
But, for now, barsome seriously bad luck or bad bungling, he is firmly in the saddle, and strongly popular.Annotated text<SITUATION>If they ever doubted it, Venezuela's political elite now know who's boss: President <ACTORNAME=Chavez ID= l>Hugo Chavez.

Example 2: Encyclopaedia Britannica on Herbert MarcuseText type: encyclopedic (with ironic distance)Original textA Hegelian-Freudian-Marxist, Marcuse was wedded to the ideas of radicalization, vociferous dissent, and"resistance to the point of subversion."
He believed that Western society was unfree and repressive, that itstechnology had bought he complacency of the masses with material goods, and that it had kept them intellectuallyand spiritually captive.
However, although afrank exponent of resistance tothe established order, Marcuse did notapplaud the campus demonstrations.
"I still consider the American University an oasis of free speech and realcritical thinking in the society," he said.
"Any student movement should try to protect his citadel... \[but\] try toradicalize the departments inside the university.

Processing5.1.
MethodThe annotator is to be associated to a summarizer(Delannoy et al 1998).
The summarizer is a non-knowledge-based selector of passages which combinesindices of different aspects: keywords assigneddynamically, position, word distribution, coherence vialexical chains (using WordNet or Roget: Barker et al 98a)and markers, and thesaurus relations.
The initialgranularity is that of sentences, although we are trying torefine it with a grammar.
In the compilation of the finalsummary, sentences are selected one by one, with a bias tosentences containing keywords underrepresented so far.
Asa partly implemented feature, the input is classified in oneof various text types (neutral, news story, politicalanalysis, narrative, tc.
), and the user selects one of severaloutput types (events, changes, utterances withouttreatment, or details of argumentation)The processing for argumentation mark-up (in progress)uses a chart parser for segmenting, rather than the shallowsegmenting inMarcu 97.
It targets more than "clause-like"units: non-clause circumstantials (adverbials or adjectivals)are recognized and kept separate.
This is to allows forsummarization by elimination of minor constituents ("textreduction": Greffenstette 98), and also for the treatment ofeircumstantials in narrow/broad scope as required ( as in:"villagers, who holds guns, will be considered outlaws" vs."villagers who hold guns will be considered outlaws").Non-binary branching (3 and more) is allowed, as arecross-level relations, e.g.
between a clause and a wholeparagraph, inparticular for cases of propositional reference("Those points will be discussed etc.
"), or meta-textualreference ("the concept outlined in the previous paragraphis now applied to etc.
"), that is, de dicto as opposed to dere .The set of cues is inspired by the extensive list in Marcu97.
There are rules of scoping for the cues into relationsand their scope over text segments.
The construction of thetree of rhetorical relations is done by applying rules.23The user can intervene in the process to rectify a decisionof the system, or to insert free-style comments or links.5.2.
OutputThe output can be:?
the input text, enriched with marked up ofargumentative structure in the discourse XML (ifdesired, highlighted via a browser)?
a graph of the argumentation components (e.g.
for acritical thinking class)?
a point-form summary of claims made by the authorand, if applicable, of the actors reported on?
a highlight of fallacies: bad arguments (with flaws ofevidence, relevance, cohesion, etc.)?
answers to standard questions in general or on the typeof text, as: timeline, list of persons and chargesmentioned, eclarations, predictions, etc.?
a chart of the positions of various actors pro andcontra the main points at issue - and of theiroppositions (e.g.
on an article of political analys!s).At the time of writing, this is not operational.
As intended,the selection of the output type is done by an HTMLinterface lauching a CGI which parses the XML andtranslates it to HTML, selectively to reflect the choice ofviewing made by the user.6.
Discussion6.1.
Suitability and scope- In our manual experiments, XML-style annotationappears to cover all argument structures, in terms ofadequacy and non-ambiguity.
Still, the criteria ofmultiple-user satisfaction, and of the fulfilment of afurther task, should be examined in the future.- the XML representation framework is versatile inmatters of extensibility, scoping, and embedding; still,one will have to test it for possible overlap roblems- the annotation scheme is inherently multilingual; theannotation process requires language-specific lexicaland syntactic resources- the mark-up addresses argumentative texts: thosereporting collaborative orcontradictory discussants- ( in  direct speech, indirect speech, or syntheticrephrasing), those where the author gives claims andrationales, and those texts meeting both criteria.
Morefinely, it may be useful to characterize differentsubtypes of texts: a reader does not look for the sameinformation i different types of texts; and not withthe same cues.
This has not been considered as yet.6.2.
Assumptions, risks, limitationsThere is a risk of running into problems of overlap:To address this, we have to :- use the tag classification- handle specific priorities where applicable- for the rest, use one the existing means for handlingoverlap, e.g.
as proposed for the Bergen WittgensteinArchive (Sperberg-McQueen & Huitfeldt 98), or by thescoping methods of GDA.7.
Background and AdvancementWe had the idea of HTML-style mark-up of discourse inearly 1998, before we were even acquainted with XML.The original purpose was mostly one of highlighting, forapplying critical-thinking analyses in a standardizable way.Experiments have been done manually by the author on 42texts, 10 to 600 words long, consisting of news articles (LeMonde, CNN Online), encyclopedia entries (E. Britannicaonline) and on texts containing more in-depth analyses(The Economist; editorials in Le Monde; articles of LeMonde Diplomatique and the New York Review OfBooks).The analyzer is being prototyped in Perl to be associated tothe aummarizer in (Delannoy et al 98).
It includes anoperational parser of XML, and a chart-parser of English,in progress.The system of tags can probably be improved by moremanual mark-up and evaluation.
The DTD is not yetmature; it should be refined and validated on a largenumber of texts, and preferably in a collaborative way..8.
ConclusionThis proposal is, to our knowledge, the first to explicitlyapply XML mark-up to argumentation mark-up.
It claimsthat the mark-up can be useful both for human critiquerand for further processing, thus being a multi-purpose,intermediate-level representation.Future work includes:?
tracking possible conflicts of scope between tags(overlap, vs. simple embedding)?
a systematic evaluation of the tag set, itsadjustment, and the definition of a DTD?
completing the implementation?
application of machine learning (cf.
the AAAI-97Spring Symposium on ML for Discourse analysis;Hirschman et al 98; Barker & Szpakowicz 98).?
implementing an acquisition tool with which auser could simply highlight a passage and clickthe appropriate ag's button.?
exploration of information extraction based on acombination of HTML tags, (for structure) anddiscourse XML; comparison with the automaticmark-up of online catalogs?
test with the students class on critical thinking24?
testing onpolylogal discourse?
designing a critiquing software, and especially arecognizer of fallacies?
gather more data on speed reading or plain text,and on reading/speed reading of annotated text?
last but not least, engaging in a collaborativeeffort owards a common DTD for argumentationmark-up, which is an important part of discoursemark-up.9.
