!ost exir;tinq programsare capable of applying context-free phrase-structureqrammars to the sentences anrl t!lc various techniciues fordoinq this arc, by now, fairly well unrlcrstood.
Ilowcvcr,this kind of grapnar is now qcnerally consitlered t6 beinadequate because it fails to revcnl t!le most importantproperties of the majority of sentences and becnuse ittypically dctlarcs a sentence to be more amhiquous thanit really is.
These difficulties are overcome to someextent by context-sensitive grammars and to a large extentby transformational granmars.
The proqram discussed inthis :%emorandurn is capable of analyzinq sentences withcontext-sensitive qranmars and with grammars cf a classvery similar to that of transformational qrammvs.Experimentation with tinis program is still in its veryearly stages, but the results reported here suqqest thatthe technique used may prove to he a powerful and efficienttool for language analysis.
If so, it can hope to findapplication in informational retrieval, command andcontrol.

As of  1970 OST includeda s t a f f  member f o r  computers, Dr. A. Michael Noll.

The service i s  experi-mental i n  nature, and will  be the f i r s t  t ransat lant ic  application of packet-switch-ing technology.
I t  will  be used as a basis for gaining experience in transmittingbetween two packet networks ( the  second network being the Experimental Packet-Switch-ed System in  the United Kingdom), and to  explore the use of s a t e l l i t e s  in interna-t ional networks.NBS A~NOUNCES NEW COBOL STANOARDThe Repartment of Comerce has approved a new Federal Information Processing Standard(FIPS) 22-1, which makes Cobol-74 the new language standard applicable to  a l l  Federalagencies.
Cobol i s  the only programing language for  which a Federal standard hasbeen established.
I t  i s  maintained on a voluntary basis,  and i s  presently used by8 government agencies.
The new standard will  require Cobol compliers used by theFederal government t o  comply with the 1974 Ansi Cobol specifications, and vendorswill be required to  categorize t he i r  compilers within one of four NBS levels,  eachof which consists of a speci f ic  s e t  of Ansi "functional processing modules.
"PROGRAM ERROR GENERATES MASSfVE SOCIAL SECURITY OVERPAYMENTThe c m i s s i o n e r  of the Social Security Administration has t e s t i f i ed  before an over-s ight  comi t t ee  of the House Ways and Means Comittee t ha t  Social Security overpay-ments of $461 million have been ident i f ied ,  and that  the actual t o t a l  may be as highas $800 million.
The er rors  were made largely or en t i r e ly  through the conlputersystem which supports the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.
Changes in aComplex s ta tu tory  scheme have caused a haphazard development of SSI software; but theagency a lso  admits t o  a lack of internal control,  as well as a lack of coordinationbetween systems or between programers working on the  same system.
The Comnissionert e s t i f i ed  that  many of the erroneous transactions a r e  " l i t e r a l l y  beyond anybody'sd i rec t  control."
The er rors  have a lso  led to  concern t ha t  the system i s  vulnerablet o  fraudulent abuse by agency employees.PRIVACY PROTECTION STUDY COMMISSION MEETS IN WASHINGTONThe Privacy Protection Study Comissioh met in Washington on September 8 ,  with anagenda which included presentations From Federal government groups and prospectivecontractors.

Members of Congress frequently request suchaccess t o  aid t he i r  constituents i n  dealing with Federal agencies.
The s i tua t ionwas resolved, temporarily a t  l e a s t ,  by an OMB memo recommending that each agencyes tabl ish  Congressional access as a "routine use" of a system of records underthe Act; the ef fec t  on the OMB procedure w i l l  be t o  obviate the need fo r  niembcrsof Congress t o  obtain written consent i n  order t o  access a constituent 's  dataf i l e .Finally,  Sen. Kennedy has taken :I strong issue  with a Jus t ice  Department opinionwhich operated t o  exempt records which an agency had exempted from public accessunder the  Privacy Act, from access under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)as well.
In response t o  Kennedy's objection, the Jus t i ce  Department has proposeda new regulation which would allow the FOIA t o  apply t o  records exempted from thePrivacy Act, but only a t  an agency's d iscre t ion.POLITICS AND PRIVACYA number of prominent pol i t ic ians  have been addressing the privacy issue  recently,most notably President Ford.
In an address ((1 a t  Stanford Law School, Ford spoke ofthe need t o  balance the individual r i gh t  of privacy with the government's l e g i t i -mate need fo r  information related t o  i t s  program.
While Ford made c lear  h i s  in-tolerance of i l l e g a l  invasions of privacy, h is  coments were primarily directedtoward threats  t o  privacy which resul t  from otherwise benef ic ia l  programs; i nsuch areas,  he said, ' k e  must protect every individual from excessive and unnec-essary intrusions by a Big Brother bureaucracy."
In a separate statement Fordl a t e r  sa id  t ha t  "N eeping only an essent ia l  minimum of these records i s  the mostef fec t ive  protection we have" against incursions on privacy.Sen.
Tunney, chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, recently re-affirmad h i s  concern with privacy i n  a speech (#) on the Senate f loor .
He notedt ha t  h i s  Subcommittee was presently moving b i l l s  which: would prohibit  militaryspying on c iv i l ians ;  would provide fo r  control of criminal records (WashingtonReport, 9/75); and would secure greater  privacy protection fo r  government employ-ees.
Turtney pointed out the need t o  ant ic ipate  technological threats  t o  privacy,an endeavor i n  which AFIPS has already offered assistance t o  the Senator.Speaking i n  a recent interview i n  EDP Weekly, Rep.

5, December, 1975WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTSFCC APPROVES DIRECT INTERCONNECTION OF TERMINAL EQUIPMENTThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ruled that users may directlyconnect terminal equipment to the telephone network without the use of carrier-supplied connecting arrangements, provided they comply with FCC requirements.The ruling (#) is to become effective April 1, 1976.Impact of the decision.
The ruling will permit users to connect computer termi-nal equipment to the network without the necessity of either a modem supplied bythe common carrier (generally ATFjT) or a telephone company data access arrange-ment (DAA); the D M  had previously been required if a Bell modem were not used.While circuitry similar to the DAA will still have to be incorporated in customer-supplied equipment, it is expected to be considerably less expensive to usersthan present AT&T lease charges.Xistory.
The FCC ruling requiring the use of telephone company connecting ar-rangements for user-supplied terminals has been the subject of controversey eversince its implement?tioh after the Carterfone decision (which allowed the connec-tion of custo,mer-provided equipment) in 1968.
The common carriers have arguedthat such arrhghents are necessary to protect the network against potentialhams, such as those identified by a 1970 National Academy of Sciences study:hazardous valtages, excessive signal power levels, excessive longitudinal imbal-ance, and imp,roper network control signaling.
Opponents maintain, however, thatthe telephone cmpanies have insisted on carrier-supplied access arrangements toprotect their own revenues.Registration program.
The FCC will allow interconnection only if it is donethrough either protective circuitry registered with the FCC, or directly throughequipment which is itself registered.
The Commission has also required thatcarrier-supplied terminal equipnient be registered (a requirement not generallyimposed on comon carriers) in order to enhance network protection, insure compet-itive equality (between carriers and non-carriers) in the manufacture of suchequipment, and to prov'i'de a "benchmark" against which to judge non-carrierapplications.Possible appeal.
ATBT is expected to appeal the FCC ruling, which may delay itseffective date.
Further, the ruling applies only to the technical aspects ofintercomection; a separate proceeding (Docket 20003) is underway to examine thepotential economic harm from competition in this area.
A reversal of the technicalruling would appear unlikely on economic grounds, since data communications devicesaccount for only the small portion of ATET revenues.7 5OTP REPORT ON SOCIAL ISSUES IN EPTSThe White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTY) has relensed a studyon the non-economic implications of EFTS, entitled "Value Choices in ElectronicFunds Trnnsfer Policy."
In transmitting the study to the Vice President, OTPActing Director John Eger said "both because of our particular mandate to evolvepolicy relating to the intorconncction of contputers with teleconununications, anintcrconncction which is tlie necessary foundation of any EFT system, and becauseof our concern for i,.formed and cffcctive formnulution of policy in the executivebrdnch, DTP has begun to scrutinize closely the increasing range of Fedcral gov-ernmcnt activity in this area.

A prim:~ry signific:lnce of thercport is thc indication that OTP is squarely concc~ncd irith the social in~p:ict ofEFTS.

1 ,: 1!11!,1ry, l!1-11NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FORMS AI) llOC COMPUTER SCIENCI; P M N I N I ;  (;RO!iI!The Assembly of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MIPS) in thc National \c.~Jrinyof Sciences (NAS) has recently formed an ad hoc ComputerSciences l'lanning Groupto consider activities which AMPS might undertake in that field.
'Ihc L;rauli is toconsider "what aspects of this rapidly growing discipline and w h ~ t  probie~~~s rel~t-ed to federal and non-federal applications might benefit through special studies,particularly by [WS] .
"The AFIPS Washington Office has confirmed that the formation of the ComliutcrScience Planning Group was precipitated in part by letters earlier this year toDr.
Philip Handler (president, NAS) from Anthony Ralston and Jean Sammet, presi-dents of AFIPS and ACM, respectively.
Both Ralston and S m e t  urged Handler toconsider organizational changes which would recognize computer science as .I sepa-rate discipline within the National Research Council [NRC -- the NAS and theNational Academy of Erlgineering), arguing that this recognition has already oc-curred within major universities and throughout most of the academic commun~ty.History.
There have been a number of activities within the NRC in the last tenyears which relate to computer science and engineering, most recently the ComputerScience and Engineering Board (CSEB).
The CSEB was in existence from 1968 to 1972,chartered to assess the implications of information performing technology withregard to the public and private sectors of the United States.
The National RE-search Council generally operates by performing studies under contract to variousFederal groups, and occasionally undertakes similar studies on its own initiative;there have been no studies primarily related to information processingsince thetermination of the CSEB.While the Academies have approximately n dozen computer scientists and engineersas members, the computer science discipline has not been organizationally recog-nized outside of existing groups in mathematics and engineering.Meeting agenda.
At its recent first meeting, the Computer Science Planning Groupundertook a general discussion of areas which would be candidates for NRC atten-tion, including (1) the impact of computers on soclety, (2) computer engineering,(3) computer science, and (4) the commercial impact of computer technology.
Re-ports will be produced in these areas by early 1976.Outlook for a permanent group While there is apparently no consensus in theGroup on how to proceed, it appears highly likely that a recommendation will beforthcoming to set up a permanent computer science group within the NRC; the prin-cipal unresolved questions relate to the structure of such a group.
There arepresently three other groups proceeding in parallel with the AMPS group, each ofwhich will ultimately produce a report recommending NRC activities in this field,these are the Assembly of Engineering, the Assembly of Behavorial and SocialSciences, and the Connnission on Sociutczhniciil Systems.P l a ~ i n g  grasp nembers.

Western Union International (Wl) has received ;ipproval from th' Fcdcr:ll Com-munications Commission (FCC) to Furnish its Internationnl Digital ll;~t;~ Scrv~ce (1DI)S)to Prance, Italy, Spain a ~ d  Austria.
The scrvico is cl;~imcd to provide high qualityand reliability, primarily by simultnneous transmission of data by undersca cableand satellite.
Thc FCC approval is for one year of operation, within whicli IDDSmust submit an analysis af its service.
IDDS will be required to submit a t:~riffproposal before beginning service, based on transmission speed (from 50 hits to 9.6kilobits per second), transmission volumc and other f:ictors.ITT.
ITT Domcstic Transmission Systems has filed an application with thc I:CC nsk-ing for approval of a domestic data commu~iicntions network.
Thc proposed scrvice,to be known as Corn-Pak, is a packet-switched system which woul'd be cap.lble of ser-vicing incompatible computers and computer terminals.
The network would initiallyserve 13 cities by 1977, eventually expnnding to 24 cities.
Like other value-addedcarriers (e.g., Telenet) Com-Pak would rely on circuits leased frum common carriers.While computer-related transmissions on the network will generally be immeditite, adelayed-transmission service (at a lawer price) will also be available to customersfor'applications such as word processing.Related issues.
ITT World Comunications has bpposed the FCC authori:ation of IDDS,arguing that the FCC should conduct a techaicill inquiry on optimum methods for inter-national digitnl data services, before g~xnting the IDDS application.On a separate topic, Western Union and other carriers have petitioned the UnitedStates Court of Appeals in Washington to reverse FCC approval of the proposed CMLdata communications satellite venture (Washington Report, 11/75), asserting that itwould have monopolistic effect (such as dividing the market for satellite data com-munications between ATET and CMI,).
The petitioning firms feel the monopoly condi-tions which might exist subsequent to CML entry into the market could not be reversedby antitrust regulation or litigation.COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY EFTS SURVEYWhile the EFTS Comission continues to organize, a recent survey released byComptroller of the Currency, James E. Smith, indicates the extent and distributionof existing EFTS systems.
According tb Smith:The survey, which had a response rate of 97 percent of 4,700 nationalbanks, showed that fully 10 percent of the banks had at least oneAutomated Teller Machine.
As expected, a high proportion of largebanks have an EFT system - 72.9 percent o t  billion dollar banks and48.4 percent of those in the half billion to billion dollar range.However, more than h a l f  o f  ; i l l  1'1"l' cystcms .ire i n  banks with under$100 mi l l ion  i n  d e p o s i t s .

There is little disphte regard-ing the actual functions of the device; the argument is focused primarily on wheth-er such functions should be characterized as data communications or data processingThe fundamental issues, however, are (1) whether the data services embodied in theDataspeed 40 should be subject to government regulation, and (2) whether a govern-ment-regulated monopoly (ATBT) should be allowed td manufacture such terminals andthus compete with the private enterprise computer industry.
The Dataspeed 40 is a1920 character CRT terminal and standard teletypewriter keyboard, with optionalfeatures for functions such as printing and editing.The computef industry opponents to AT&T all cite a 1956 consent decree which prohib-its AT&T from entering an unregulated industry; further, they refer to the FCC "Com-puter Inquiry", which ruled that cdrmnon carriers may provide data processing servicesonly through unregulated subsidiaries.
The terminal manufacturers fear that theDataspeed 40 will be priced below their competitive offerings, through cross-subsidiesfrom othar ATGT services.SENATOR BYRD URGES MORATORIUM ON EXPORT OF M)hIPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO U.
S .S .R'.In a December 18 speech (#) on the Senate floor, Sen. Robert Byrd called for a morato-rium on the export of computer technology to the Soviet Union.
He recommended thatthe Departments of State and Commerce take immediate steps to institute a program toreassess technology export, and to evaluate U.S. gains and losses in technology cur-rently exchanged.Byrd argued that the export of.
computer technology potentially threatens peace,rather than promotes it.
He noted that "filhe United States has a universally unques-tioned superiority in this field .
.
.
.
From the standpoint of tefense, the edge inmilitary potential that the United States has enjoyed is due, in large part, to ourapplication of computer technology to military weaponry."
Bryd described Americanintelligence reports that the Soviets had been acquiring computers which can be appliedto military technology, and that $500 milllm worth of such equipment was acquired fromthe United States last year.IBM AND PARTNERS PROPOSE SATELLITE BUSINESS SYSTEMSIBM, Comsat and Aetna Insurance have proposed a $250 million network for satellitetransmission of voice and data communications, to the Federal Communications Cdnunission(FCC).
The new venture, Satellite Business Systems (SBS), would be equally owned bythe three uartnere, thereby meeting earlier FCC restrictions on ownership (WashingtonReport, 11/73)).The network will be entirely digital, utilizing time division multiplexing.
The sat-ellites will transmit to rooftop receiving stations at or near customer sites, withground communications (SBS or other) to points which could not support their own re-ceivers.
Access ports wilI be compatible with industry standards, in accord withSBS's stated policy of nondiscrimination in interconnection.OTA CREATES HIGH-LEVEL SCIENCE ADVISORY GROUPThe Congressional Office of Tethnology Assessment (OTA) has organized an advisarypanel on research and development policies, according to a recent issue of Science 8buement .Rsport .
The panel was sai'd to be organized in mid-1975; it was thereforenot intended to overlap with the Administration's advisory groups which are plsnningfor the new Presidential science adviser (Washington Report, 1/76).The OTA panel, in contrast to the Presidential advisory groups, is largely composedof academicians, including Jerome IVicsner (president, MIT and President Kennedy'sscience.adviser) and Donald Hornig (president, Brown University and President Johnson'sscience adviser).
Two panel members are closely re1;lted to information processing:Lewis Branscomb (vice president and chief scientist, IBM) and Herbert Simon (Carneige-Mellon University).
Branscomb is one of the few members belonging to both the OTAgroup and the Presidential advisory groups; he will head a special study on applica-tlons of science and technology.
The panel is funded to October, 1977 at a level of$925 thousand.NEWS BRIEFSThe Privacy Protection Study Commission will hold hearings on February 11, 12 and 13in New York City, on the record-keeping practices of credit card issuers andtravel reservatiod services.Mr.

3 March, 1976AFIPS WHITE HOUSE BRIEFINGOn February 5, 1976, senior officials of AFIPS and its constituent societies weregivenaYIhite House briefing on Federal government matters of particular relevanceto the information processing comunity.
The brienng was presented by ExecutiveBranch spokesmen from the White House as well as from the various Federal agenciescognizant of the subject areas addressed, and was arranged through the White HouseOfEce of Public Liaison.
The specific topics briefed,were selected on the basisof an advance poll taken of the AFIPS attendees.The material presented at the briefing, because of its general interest to AFIPSbeyond the audience which could be accomodated in the Yihite House Family Theater,is described at length below.OFFICE OF TELECOWNICATIONS POLICY.
John Eger, Acting Director of the White HouseOffice of Telecommunications Policy (OTP), began the briefing by describing the man-date of his office to formulate policy on the relationship between the Governmentand private sectors in telecommunications.
Characterizing the Federal governmentas a primary telecommunications user (a $50 miIlion capital investment, with annualexpenditures of $10 - $15 billion), Eger raised two fundamental question:.
First,when should the Federal government provide its own computer communications, andwhen should it rely on the private sector?
While the Federal government must becareful not to overburden existing common carriers, he said, it should leave asmuch as possible to the private sector and not become a competitor with it.
Second,what is the proper role of the Federal government in regulation of computer conunu-nications?
OTP has generally been an advocate of minimal government regulation(Washington Report, 8/75), ahd is presently developing this policy in three areas:data communications, EFTS, and privqcy.
Eger described OTP's systematic review ofregulatory legislation, and their efforts to eliminate govement regulation wherepossible.Roland Homet, Chief of the Studies and Analysis Section af OTP, reviewed the OTPanalysis of computer communications regulatory questions now before the Federal Com-munications Colmission (FCC).
Homet noted the earlier FCC "Computer Inquiry" whichdistinquished between data communications and data processing, ruling that the FCCwould regulate the former but not the latter; he further noted that the same funda-mental distinction is now at issue in both the controversey between Telenet andp-mshare (Washington Report, 11/75), and the &aspeed 40 tariff now pending beforethe FCC (Washington Report, 2 / 7 6 ) .
He went on, however, to artirulate the criticalissue underlying these controversies: should the provision of these services andgoods, however they are characterized, be,subject to government regulation at all?While it is, true that the data communications and data processing technologies arebecoming increasingly integrated, the most crucial question is whether the marketsthey address display the "natural monopoly" conditiqns which have traditionallybeen the justification for Federal economic regulation.
aTP has formally taken theposition that both the sbrvices of value-added carriers (e.g., Telenet), and themanufacture of tenninal equipment (e.g., the Dataspeed 40) should be deregulated.Charles Joyce (now OTP Special Assistant for  National Security Act iv i t ies  and for-merly Assistant Director for  Government Conununications) discussed issucs re la t ingto  the Federal government as  a user of computer communications.

Second, how I s  the Pcd-era1 government t o  t r ea t  privacy and secur i ty  i n  i t s  computer c o m m ~ ~ c h t i o n s  sys-tems?
Joyce described the  primary policy fac tors  t o  be balanced as the need forprivacy and secur i ty  i n  computer networks, and the competing pressure fo r  the c f f i -cicnces t o  be achieved in  nctworki~ig and resource sharing.

In  addition t o  describing the general Federal in teres t  i n  t h i s  area (e.g.,the Privacy and EFTS Commissions) he pointed out the VIP s tudies  on current legalprotections re la ted  t o  individual policy (by Prof. Grecnaxalt of Columbia Univer-s i t y  Law School) and on the social implications of EFTS (by Prof. Rule of SUNY).kel lcr  indicated that  OTP is undertaking a follow-up study on the threats  t o  p r i -vacy which may bc posed by a comprehensive EFT system.

Arthur Downey, Deputy AssistantSecretary of Commerce fo r  East-West Trade, began h i s  remarks with a dcscriptioii ofthe co~nplcx F ~ d e r a l  regulatory structure,  r e l a t i ng  t o  the export of computer tech-nology.
This s t ructure  i s  bas ica l ly  t r i p a r t i t e ,  with the S t a t e  Department playinga ro le  under the blutual Security Act of 1954, the Commerce Department playing thelargest r o l e  (in terms of implementation].
under the Export Administration Act of1969, and the Defense Department playing a major policy ro l e  as  required by thesame 1969 s t a tu t e  [the Pentagon has v i r t ua l l y  a veto power over exports relnted tonational security].
In  addition, the Trade Act of 1975 has created an oversightboard for  monitoring the  flow of technology t o  s o c i a l i s t  countries,  t o  be known asthe East-Nest Foreign Trade Board.Downey described "national security" controls as having the  heaviest impact on theexport &advanced technology t o  soc i a l i s t  countries, while adding that  "foreignpolicy" controls may a lso  play a ro l e  i n  the export of technology t o  speci f ic  coun-t r i e s  (e.g., Angola).
While there are  several working levels of control, thehighest i s  a t  the cabinet level i n  the Export Administration Review b a r d ,  whichi s  comprised of the Secretaries of Sta te  and Defense, who w i l l  soon be joined bythe Secretary of the Treasury as well .a i l e  most products are  exported under a "general license" (which must be obtain-ed only once'.lior a category of products), high technology products such as  comput-ers  move under "special licenses," which must be obtained fo r  each speci f ic  ship-ment.
While not defining the terms speci f ica l ly ,  Downey said that "sc ient i f ic  andeducational technologyt1 is allowed t o  t ransfer  ,freely t o  a l l  countries.
"Indus-t r i a l  data" i s  generally allowed t o  move t o  the non-co~mnunist "free world" on thetheory that  the U.S. i s  advantaged by t h i s  flow of technology to  our a l l i e s ;  thesame technology however, when exported t o  communist countries,  i s  very t i gh t lycontrolled.
In granting special l icenses,  several factors ara considered: (1) thcs t r a t eg i c  or military impact of the product, ( 2 )  the end user, (3) the end use (andwhether the computer system a t  issue i s  appropriately scaled t o  t h i s  use),  and (4)the r i sk  of diversion of the export t o  other users.
The U.S. cooperates i n  t h i sprogram of export control with i t s  13 NATO a l l i e s  and Japan in a group called theCoordinating Committee (COCOM), which maintains an International Commodity List  ofitems which are banned from export t o  socia l  t countries.In par t icular ly  d i f f i c u l t  o r  disputed applications fo r  computer export l icenses,the Commerce Department w i l l  establish a task force with other qgencies to  examinec r i t i c a l  factors;  they often draw upon the In s t i t u t e  for  Computer Sciences and Tech-nology a t  the National Bureau of Standards, which Dswney described as  a "highly re-spected, talented group."
In addition, the Department has organized several tech-n ica l  advisory c m i t t e e s  i n  areas such as computers and computer peripherals,  t oa s s i s t  it in  arriving a t  the U.S. position on export controls i n  the national andinternational contexts.Downey noted as par t icular ly  d i f f i cu l t  problems (1) assessing the r i sks  in allowingexport of training and software associated with computer sa les ,  and (2 )  assessingthe appropriateness of systems fo r  par t icular  applications.While describing the present system as a workable one, Downey acknowledged the com-peting pressures from industry t o  re lax  export controls to  a more "rea l is t ic"  level,and from Congress, which i s  generally not sympathetic t o  decontrol of high technol-ogy exports.RESEARCH AND DEVEWPMENT IN INFORMATION PROCESSING.
The research and development(RED) area was addressed i n  preseqtations from the two largest funding organizationsof computer R&D i n  t he  Federal government, the National Science Foundation (NSF)which has a proposed budget of $15.8 million i n  f i s c a l  year 1977 (FY 77) and theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which has a proposed FY 77 budget6f $37.7 million.NSF.
Dr. John Pasta, Director of the Division of Mathematical and Computer Sciencesi n  NSF, described the agency's computer science budget fo r  FY 77 i n  the con tex t a fthe  overall  RED budget proposed by President Ford (similar figures have been de-scribed i n  the February Washington Retort) Pasta noted that  overall  R&D has de-clined about 30% ( in  1967 dollars) from 1967 t o  1975, but tha t  research alone hadremained about constant.
In the proposed FY 77 budget, however, computer researchfunding i s  up 26% over FY 76 [an increase on the order of 15% over FY 76, even con-sidering inflation].Pasta pointed out that NSF 'and AKPA wi l l  remain, under the proposed FY 77 budget,the primary contributors of Federal support for research i n  computer science a tuniversit ies and colleges.

Col. David Russell, Director of the Information Processing Techniques Office(IPTO) in  the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) outlinedthe general operations and specific program of h is  of f ice .
He describes the charterof ARPA to  be working a t  the forefront of emerging technology, and he emphasizedthat ARPA is involved only in basic and exploratory research oriented toward themissions of the Department of Defense.
ARPA endeavors t o  avoid research areas beingaddressed by industry, and w i l l  withdraw from a research area i f  it appears tha t  theproblem w i l l  bd solved through indust r ia l  research.Russell gave the following outline for proposed I P M  research in FY 77 (the initialnumbers correspond to standard Department of Defense research categories and theitalicized categories are explained in greater detail below):6.1  Bash research i n  computer and comnicat ions  sciences ($17.2 million)6.2 Exploratory development- Distributed .inforrmtiot~ systems ($11.0 million)- Integmted c o m n d  and control, and oommunicntiom systems ( $ 9 .
5  million)Basic research i n  computer and c o m i c a t i o n s  sciences ($17.2 million).
IPlU under-takes research in three areas:Imge understanding ($3.0 million).
IPTO is departing from trnditional numer-ical processing of images, and moving into symbolic processing techniquesadopted from the field of artificialintelligence.InteZZigent systems ($8 .4  million).
ARPA will continue its long-standingeffort in this area (it has funded approximately 75% of all artificial in-telligence research).
The agency will focus on three areas: (1) "basic"artificial intelligence, including problem solving, natural language pro-cessing and general reasoning, (2) command and control applications, e.g.,a natural language frontend processor, and an intelligent distributed database system, ,and (3) the use of intelligent terminals to help solve themanlmachine interface problem.Advquced memory technology ( $ 4 .
8  million).
This is a new effort for ARPAbeginning in P 76, co isting of a study of hardware available to supportvery large (13' to lo9' bits) memories in the 1990ts, such as archivalbeam memories, and a related study of artificial intelligence techniques use-ful in manipulating very large data bases, such as inference and text sum-marizing.Distributed in formtion systems ($11.0 million).S o f w r e  technology ($5.0 million).
This research wiLl emphasize the in-creasing expense, and increasing reliability problems oE software.Speech processing ($4.1 million).
This research represents the last yearof ARPA's five.year program in computer understanding of continuous speech(presently feasible only at 100 times real time) and packet speech trans-mission (which would enable the ARPANET, for example, to transmit both.speech and digital information).Netuork and system security ($1.1 million).
This work will address theproblems inherent in the military multilevel classification systems, bothfrom a design and certification standpoint.Integrated connnand and control, and conminicatdons systems ($9 .5  million).
Russellcited two examples of programs:Packet radio.
A distributed net of miniprocessors connected by radiol inks  capable of transmitting data  a t  r a t e s  from 100 t o  400 Kb/sec.will  be investigated.Internett ing s tudies .

AFIPS President Anthony Ralston closed the discussion by ca l l ingon AFIPS and i t s  constituent socie t ies  t o  continue the dialogue undertaken i n  thebriefing.
This dialogue consis ts ,  he noted, not only of  obtaining and disseminat-ing information about Washington, but a l so  o l  the important task of providing tcch-nological input to  tho Federal government whore needed.PRIVACY COhBIISSION TOLD CREDIT CARD DATA AVAILABLE ~I>VES'TIGA'fOKS-.

While theCommission agreed that its primary concern would be "the broad public policy issuesof EFTS" (in contrast to technical issues) the majority of the meeting was devotedto organizational matters.
The most substantive aspect of the meeting was a dis-cussion of the proposed amendments to Federal Reserve Regulation J, which would de-fine the duties and liabilities of participants in the Federal Reserve's wire trans-fer and automated payment services, and the proposed rules for access to the FederalReserve's electronic clearing, settlement and delivery services (automrlted clearing-houses).
Both the Regulation J amendments and the interim guidelines for access [ X Iare subject to public comment until March 19.
The Comission debated whether itshould devote its resources to such interim comments on immediate issues, or whetherit should work primarily toward a comprehensive report; agreement could not bereached and the matter was postponed for further discussion at the next Commissionmeeting (scheduled for March 12).The Commission indicated it would fully exploit existing EFTS research (ChairmanWidnall noted in particular the Arthur D. Little study funded by the National ScienceFoundation, "The Consequences of Electronic Funds Transfer").
The Commission staffhas been directed to prepare a summary of the current status of EFTS within 60 days;the report is to "bring together the results from early research, both quantitativeand qualitative, and to provide beginnings of a data base for the Commission's in-quiry".
Preparation of the report will draw upon government resources as well asindependunt organizations puch as A F I P ~  .Single copies of the A r t h  D.
