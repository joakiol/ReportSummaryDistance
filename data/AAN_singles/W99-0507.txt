under 'ldeo',kusme (female cousin) under l~mshlp, and yen(friend) under 'socml status' These senses maynaturally involve addmonal dlmensmns otmeaning, however they are not cons,dered tytze-defining m the SIMPLE model In contrast,word senses encoded under the emphas~sedboxes above, such as borddame (female dronerpartner) under 'agent of temporary activity',alkohohker (an alcoholic) under 'agent ofpersistent actlwty', and lcege (doctor) under'professmn', are untried types These areidentified by more than one coordinate in thetype h~etarchy, since they involve more than onetype-defining dlmenslon of meaning Thus'agent of temporary activity' also revolves anagennve role For borddame th~s is defined bythe act of sitting next to someone at a droner'Agent of persmtent activity' and 'profession'revolve a tehc role, which for alkohohker is theact of drinking, and for lcege ~s the act of curmg2 Danish nommal  compounds denotingcontainers: expressing their internalstructure via the Qualia StructureThe internal semantic structure of Damshdeverbal nominal compounds (t efllsebelcegnmg (flagging, lit 'flagstone paving'))47can to some extent be ~dent~fied by the argumentstructure of the derived verb and the internalranking of ~ts arguments (cf Orsnes, 1995) Incontrast, non-deverbal nominal compoundsgenerally display a more arbitrary internalstructure m Damsh (cf Paggm & Orsnes 1993),and hence they reqmre a h~gher degree .ofexpresswe power m the lex~cal entries TheQuaha Structure as It ~s expressed m theSIMPLE model provides a good basls for alexlcahsed encoding of Damsh non-deverbalnominal compounds, as for example nominalcompounds denoting containersThe template type 'Container' belongs to the setof templates conmtutmg the SIMPLE CoreOntology It is a unified type that has theumficat~on path 'Concrete entity +Artffact/Agenttve + Tehc' Thts indicates thatthe template denotes a kind of concrete nnty,and that ~t has been augmented w~th two kinds ofaddltmnal type-defining mformatmn (1)agentlve mformatmn (namely that these concreteentrees are man-made artifacts), and (n) tehcmformatmn (namely that these concrete ntreesare used for a spemfic purpose to containthings)All Damsh contamers encoded under th~stemplate type have been encoded w~th Damshmformatmn about the formal role vm an tsa-hlermchy As a default, beholder (container) ischosen as hypernym for the Damsh containers mthe re_a-hierarchy Since containers are (man-made) artifacts, the process of their creanon ~sspectfied wa the agentlve role For Damshcontainers thls is the process fremsttlle (tocreate) As Is apparent from the umficatmn pathfor th~s template, containers are also encodedw~th the type-defining tehc mformatmn thattheir funcnon ts to contam things For Damshcontainers th~s ~s specified w~th the verbmdeholde (to contam) m the encoding of thetehc rolethe tehc role for such compounds as mdlebteger(measuring cup), raflebceger (ht cup for castingdice = dice cup), or drtkkebmger (dnnkmg cup)In the SIMPLE model, the encoding of themeaning of bmger can also be further specifiedby mcludmg mformatmn about the constltutwe..role for other types of compounds Theencodmgs can mclude addmonal mformatmn on0) the materml of which the contamer is made,e g plasttcbmger (plastm cup), messmgbcegel(brass cup), or papbceger (paper cup), or (n)what the container (prototyp~cal\[y) contains, egaskebmger (ashtray), gtftbceger (poisonedchahce), or yoghurtbceger (yoghurt cup)The following SGML-encoded examples fromthe Danish SIMPLE lexicon 2 demonstrate theuse of the SIMPLE Quaha Structure todlstmgmsh between different ypes of compoundcontainers The first example shows theencoding of vmflaske (wine bottle) This isshown to be a hyponym offlaske (bottle) m theformal ls_a-relattonshlp The encoding ofvmflaske differs from flaske by the addmonalconstitutive mformatmn expressmg that ~t(prototyplcally) contains vm (wine) In thesecond example, the meaning of bcerepose(carrying bag) ~s hnked to Its hypernym pose(bag) m the Is_a-hierarchy The encoding ofbcerepose also contains the addmonal tehcmformanon that Its prototyptcal functmn ts tocany somethmg (bcere) In the last example, themeamng of bhkd&e (tin can) is shown to be ahyponym of ddse (can) m the Is_a-hierarchyThe encodmg of bhkdc?tse also contains theadd~ttonal const~tunve mfotmatmn that ~t ~smade of bhk (tin), whereas ddse would beunderspec~fied w~th respect to th~s roleThe Quaha Structure used m the SIMPLE modelis well-stated for capturing a ma.lonty of themtemai lelatmnshlps for Damsh non-deverbalnominal compounds denoting

is handled ma uniform way In the SIMPLE model vm theidentification of a set of well-estabhshed regularsemantic lasses, which are adjusted for each ofthe languages involved Whde unsystematicambiguous readings of a word are represented astotally unrelated semantic units, regularpolysemous senses can be encoded asmterhnked semantic units In the SIMPLEmodel this is represented by an reformation slotcalled complex, whose value is the polysemousclass to which the semantic unlt belongs Thisstrategy relates to Pustejovsky (1995), whereregular polysemous classes correspond tocomplex types, which allows for anunderspectfied semantic typing of word sensesThe solution adopted in SIMPLE intends to be afirst step towards the future development ofunderspeclfled semantic types (Lencl et al1998)Empmcally-based studies of regularpolysemous emantic lasses of Damsh are atpresent very scarce (see however Boje &Sch0sler (ed) (1992) pp 11-12 and Braasch &Pedersen (forthcoming) for some minorcons~derauons of regular polysemy m Danishnouns as well as Malmgren (1988) for anextensive study of iegular polysemy in Swedish,a language which displays polysemousbehavlour very slmdar to Damsh) Th~s factunderpins the need for corpus-oriented ncodingprocedures which have therefore been given acentlal focus m the the Danish SIMPLEd~ctlonary in the sense that each semanticencoding is supported by corpus exammauons 3In the Damsh lexicon the most productive casesof regular polysemy mvolwng concrete nounsprove to be the following?
