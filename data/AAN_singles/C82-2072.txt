I~RAN AND PHRED: ANALYSIS AND I~ODUCTION USING A CO~0NKNOWLEDG~BASERobert  Wi lenskyComputer Sc ience  D lw is ion ,  Department of  EECS, Un ivers i tyof  Ca l i fo rn?a ,  Berke ley ,  Ca l t fo rn?a  94720, USA1 o0 In t roduct ionWe propose a model of  language use that  i s  der ived  fromwlewl~ language process ing  systems as knowledge-based sys -tems.
The knowledge that  needs to  be represented  and organ izedhere  i s  the la rge  amount of  knowledge about what the u t te ran-ces of a language mean.
In this paper, I describe some of thetheoretleel underp inn i~e of the model, and then desorlbe twoprograms, PHRAN and I~RED, that  are  based on these  ideas?
Wehave conducted a number of  exper iments  wi th  these  systemsthat  have some bear ing  on the u t i l i ty  of  the  model "s presumpt-ions ,  inc lud ing  tes t ing  these  systems on o ther  languages (Spa-h i sh  and Ch inese) ,  and implement ing one of  them in  a re la t ion -a l  data  base system.2 .0 .
The assumptions o f  the model2?1?
The Importance of  Non-generat ive  Lan~ageLanguage user  knows a great  number o f  fac t  about whatu t te rances  o f  the i r  language mean.
That i s ,  in  add i t ion  toknowing the meanings o f  a la rge  number of  words, they know thesteaL%license of  a se t  of  mean ingfu l  ingu /s t to  un i t s  that  arenot  necessar i l y  understood in  term8 of  the i~ components.
Ourcon jec ture  i s  that  such un i t s  const i tu te  a very  cons iderab lef rac t ion  o f  the language knowledge needed by an in te l l igentlanguage processor.- 296 -2.2 .
3harab le  Knowledge BaseIn  our  model, i t  i s  assumed that  the knowledge usedfo r  analysis and fo r  product ion  is by and laxge the same.That i s ,  there  i s  on ly  one data  base of knowledge about themeanings of a language 's  forms.
By having the knowledge ofthe two components be a shared data  base, on ly  one form ofrepresentat ion  i s  needed.
Moreover, the add i t ion  of new know-ledge to thAs data  base extends the capab i l i t i es  of both sys -tems s imul taneous ly .As thAs requi rement  forces  knowledge to be representeddeo lara t ive ly ,  the o ther  benef i t s  of such representat ions  emeen joyed  as we l l .
For exsunple, in  th i s  format,  knowledge aboutthe language i s  kept separate  from the process ing  s t ra teg iesthat  apply th i s  knowledge to the unders tand ing  and product iontasks .
Thuue adding new knowledge requ i res  only adding newassszt ionB to the data  base,  not wr i t ing  and debug~ newcode.
In  add i t ion ,  o ther  knowledge bes ides  the mesu~ng of aphrase can be eas i ly  assoc ia ted  wi th  such dec la ra t ive  repres -entat ions .3 .0 .
PHRAN and P~h~EDWe have been deve lop ing  th i s  model of language use intwo re la ted  programs, PHRAN (PHRasal ANs~yzer) and PHRED(PHRasal ~ngllsh Diction).
PHRAN is a language understandingprogram wr i t ten  by ?
iga l  Arens.
I t  reads Eng l i sh  sentencesand produces representat ions  from them that  encode the i rmeaning.
PHRED is a natura l  language product ion  meohanAs~,developed by Steven Upst i l l .
PHRED takes meaning representat -ions  as input  and expresses them i~ ~ng l i sh  sentences .Both PHRAN and PHRED shs~e a common data  base of lang-uage knowledge.
This data  base conta ins  dec la ra t ive  represent -a t ions  about what the phrase of the Eng l i sh  language mean.This knowledge i s  s to red  in  the form of p attex~-conoeDt pears .A pat tern  i s  a phrasa l  const ruct  of vary ing  de~rees of spec i -f i c i ty .
The concept par t  of a pat tern -concept  pa i r  i s  a ogn-- 297 -ceptua l  template  that  represents  the  meaning of  the  assoc ia t -ed phrase .
Together ,  these  pa i rs  assoc ia te  d i f fe rent  forms ofu t te rances  w i th  the i r  mean ings ,PHRAN unders tands  by read ing  the  input  text  and t ry ingto  f ind  the  phrasa l  pat terns  that  app ly  to  i t .
Eventua l ly ,  theconceptua l  template  assoc ia ted  w i th  the  des i red  pat tern  i sused to  generate  the  s t ructure  denot ing  the  meaning of  theu t terance .
PHRED produces  sentences  that  encode an idea  byexamin ing  the  same knowledge base .4 .0  Spanish and Chinese PHRANWe have build both a Spanish and a Chinese version ofPHRAN s imply  by chans ing  the  pat tern -concept  data  base.
Theseprograms lend  suppor t  to  some of  the  c la ims  we make fo r  ourmodel .
We found that  i t  was poss ib le  to  rewr i te  most o f  thepat terns  in to  phrases  of  another  language w i thout  hav insgtheknowledge encoder  learn  anyth ing  about  the  inner  work ings  ofthe  program.
Th is  suggests  that  a system l i ke  PHR~ cou ld  bedes igned to  a l low fa i r ly  easy  const ruct ion  of  a language pro -cessor  fo r  a new language,  o r  to  a l low fo r  the  add i t ion  ofspec ia l  purpose phrases  or  Ja rgon  by some user  who was not  anexpert AI programmer.5.0 AI and Relation Data BasesWe implemented a version of PHRAR in a conventional da-ta base system.
PItR.kN was re-written in EQEEL, a query langua-ge for the INGRES relational data base system developed atBerke ley .
Tes ts  were run  to  compare the  re la t ive  per foremnceof  the  systems on var ious  s i ze  data  bases .The resu l t s  can be summarized as fo l lows :  The LISPvers ion  i s  cons iderab ly  fas ter  when the  data  base  of  pat tern -- concept  pa i rs  i s  smal l .
However, when the  data  base i s  la rge(2000 words and 500 patterns), the EQUEL version is about 3times faster than the LISP version.
Thus performance problemsin natural lan~Aag@ may be solved by importing developments indata  base techno logy  as  the  s i ze  of  our  knowledge bases  grow.- 298 -
