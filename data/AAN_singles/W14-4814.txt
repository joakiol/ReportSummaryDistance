Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Computational Terminology, pages 114?124,Dublin, Ireland, August 23 2014.Towards Automatic Distinction between Specialized and Non-SpecializedOccurrences of Verbs in Medical CorporaOrnella Wandji Tchami, Natalia GrabarCNRS UMR 8163 STLUniversit?e Lille 359653 Villeneuve d?Ascq, Franceornwandji@yahoo.fr, natalia.grabar@univ-lille3.frAbstractThe medical field gathers people of different social statuses, such as students, pharmacists, man-agers, biologists, nurses and mainly medical doctors and patients, who represent the main actors.Despite their different levels of expertise, these actors need to interact and understand each otherbut the communication is not always easy and effective.
This paper describes a method for a con-trastive automatic analysis of verbs in medical corpora, based on the semantic annotation of theverbs nominal co-occurents.
The corpora used are specialized in cardiology and distinguishedaccording to their levels of expertise (high and low).
The semantic annotation of these corpora isperformed by using an existing medical terminology.
The results indicate that the same verbs oc-curring in the two corpora show different specialization levels, which are indicated by the words(nouns and adjectives derived from medical terms) they occur with.1 IntroductionThe medical field gathers people of different social statuses, such as medical doctors, students, pharma-cists, managers, biologists, nurses, imaging experts and of course patients.
These actors have differentlevels of expertise ranging from low (typically, the patients) up to high (e.g., medical doctors, pharma-cists, medical students).
Despite their different levels of expertise, these actors need to interact.
But theirmutual understanding might not always be completely successful.
This situation specifically applies topatients and medical doctors who are the two main actors within the medical field (McCray, 2005; Zeng-Treiler et al., 2007).
Beyond the medical field, this situation can also apply to other domains (e.g., law,economics, biology).
The research question is closely linked to the readability studies (Dubay, 2004),whose purpose is to address the ease with which a document can be read and understood by people, andalso the ease with which the corresponding information can be exploited by the people later.
As noticed,one source of difficulty may be due to the specific and specialized notions that are used : for instance,abdominoplasty, hymenorrhaphy, escharotomy in medical documents, affidavit, allegation, adjudicationin legal documents, etc.
This difficulty occurs at the lexical and conceptual level.
Another difficultymay come from complex syntactic structures (e.g., coordinated or subordinated phrases) that can occurin such documents.
Hence, this difficulty is of syntactic nature.
With very simple features, reduced to thelength of words and sentences, the classical readability scores address these two aspects (Flesch, 1948;Dale and Chall, 1948; Bormuth, 1966; Kincaid et al., 1975).
Typically, such scores do not account for thesemantics of the documents.
In recent readability approaches, the semantics is being taken into accountthrough several features, such as: medical terminologies (Kokkinakis and Toporowska Gronostaj, 2006);stylistics of documents (Grabar et al., 2007; Goeuriot et al., 2007); lexicon used (Miller et al., 2007);morphological information (Chmielik and Grabar, 2011); and combination of various features (Wang,2006; Zeng-Treiler et al., 2007; Leroy et al., 2008; Franc?ois and Fairon, 2013).We propose to continue studying the readability level of specialized documents through the semanticfeatures.
More precisely, we propose to perform a comparative analysis of verbs observed in medicalcorpora written in French.

languages.
Our study focuses on verbs andtheir co-occurents (nouns and adjectives deriving from medical terms), and aims to investigate on theverb semantics, according to the types of constructions and to the words with which the verb occurs inthe corpora.
In order to achieve this, we pay a particular attention to the syntactic and semantic featuresof the verbs?
co-occurents in the studied texts.Our method is based on the hypothesis according to which the meaning of a verb can be influencedor determined by its context of appearance (L?Homme, 2012) and by its arguments.
Indeed, variousstudies on specialized languages have shown that the verb is not specialized by itself (L?Homme, 1998;Lerat, 2002).
Rather, being a predicative unit that involves participants called arguments, the verb can bespecialized or not, depending on its argumental structure and the nature of these arguments.In our study, the description of verbs is similar to the one performed in Frame Semantics (FS) (Fill-more, 1982), since we provide semantic information about the verbs co-occurents.
The Frame Semanticsframework is increasingly used for the description of lexical units in different languages (Atkins et al.,2003; Pad?o and Pitel, 2007; Burchardt et al., 2009; Borin et al., 2010; Koeva, 2010) and specialized fields(Dolbey et al., 2006; Schmidt, 2009; Pimentel, 2011).
Among other things, Frame Semantics providesfor a full description of the semantic and syntactic properties of lexical units.
FS puts forward the notionof ?frames?, which are defined as conceptual scenarios that underlie lexical realizations in language.
Aframe comprises a frame evoking lexical units (ULs) and the Frame Elements (FEs), which represent theparticipants to the verbal process.
For instance, in FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006), the frame CUREis described as a situation that involves some specific Frame Elements, (such as HEALER, AFFLICTION,PATIENT, TREATMENT), and includes a lexical unit such as cure, alleviate, heal, incurable, treat.1In ourapproach, an FS-like modeling should allow us to describe the semantic properties of verbs.
Using thisframework, we will be able to highlight the differences between the studied verbs usages through theirvarious frames and, by doing so, uncover the linguistic differences observed in corpora of different levelsof expertise.
However, the FS framework will be adapted in order to fit our own objectives.
Indeed, theautomatic annotation of the verbs co-occurents into frames will rely on the use of a terminology (C?ot?e,1996) which provides a semantic category for each recorded term.
These categories (e.g., anatomy, dis-orders, procedures, chemical products) typically apply to the verb co-occurents and should be evocativeof the semantics of these co-occurents and the semantic properties of verbs: we consider that the se-mantic categories represent the frame elements which are lexically realized by the terms, while the verbsrepresent the frame evoking lexical units.In a previous study, we have looked at the behavior of four verbs (observer (observe), d?etecter (detect),d?evelopper (develop), and activer (activate)) in medical corpora written by medical doctors by contrast totexts written by patients (Wandji Tchami et al., 2013).
The results showed that in the corpus written bydoctors some verbs tend to have specific meanings, according to the type of arguments that surroundthem.
In the current work, we try to go further by enhancing our method (improved semantic annotation,automated analysis of verbs) and by distinguishing specialized and non-specialized occurrences of verbs.In the next sections, we present the material used (section 2), the method designed (section 3).
Wethen introduce the results and discuss them (section 4), and conclude with future work (section 5).2 MaterialWe use several kinds of material: the corpora to be processed (section 2.1), the semantic resources(section 2.2), a resource with verbal forms and lemmas (section 2.3) and a list of stopwords (section 2.4).2.1 CorporaWe study two medical corpora dealing with the specific field of cardiology (heart disorders and treat-ments).
These corpora are distinguished according to their levels of expertise and their discursive speci-ficities (Pearson, 1998): Expert corpus contains expert documents written by medical experts for medicalexperts.
This corpus typically contains scientific publications, and show a high level of expertise.
The1https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal115corpus is collected through the CISMeF portal2, which indexes French language medical documents andassigns them categories according to the topic they deal with (e.g., cardiology, intensive care) and to theirlevels of expertise (i.e., for medical experts, medical students or patients).
Forum corpus contains non-expert documents written by patients for patients.
This corpus contains messages from the Doctissimoforum Hypertension Problemes Cardiaques3.
It shows low level of expertise, although technical termsmay also be used.
The size of corpora in terms of occurrences of words is indicated in Table 1.
We cansee that, in number of occurrences, these two corpora are comparable as for their sizes.Corpus Size (occ of words)Expert 1,285,665Forum 1,588,697Table 1: Size of the two corpora studied.2.2 Semantic resourcesThe semantic annotation of corpora is performed using the Snomed International terminology (C?ot?e,1996).
This resource provides terms which use is suitable for the NLP processing of documents, as theseare expressions close to those used in real documents.
It is structured into several semantic axes:T : TOPOGRAPHY or ANATOMICAL LOCATIONS (e.g., coeur (heart), cardiaque (cardiac), digestif (diges-tive), vaisseau (vessel));S: SOCIAL STATUS (e.g., mari (husband), soeur (sister), m`ere (mother), ancien fumeur (former smoker),donneur (donnor));P: PROCEDURES (e.g., c?esarienne (caesarean), transducteur `a ultrasons (ultrasound transducer), t?el?e-expertise (tele-expertise));L: LIVING ORGANISMS, such as bacteries and viruses (e.g., Bacillus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella,Salmonella), but also human subjects (e.g., patients (patients), traumatis?es (wounded), tu (you));J : PROFESSIONAL OCCUPATIONS (e.g., ?equipe de SAMU (ambulance team), anesth?esiste (anesthesiologist),assureur (insurer), magasinier (storekeeper));F : FUNCTIONS of the organism (e.g., pression art?erielle (arterial pressure), m?etabolique (metabolic),prot?einurie (proteinuria), d?etresse (distress), insuffisance (deficiency));D: DISORDERS and pathologies (e.g., ob?esit?e (obesity), hypertension art?erielle (arterial hypertension), can-cer (cancer), maladie (disease));C: CHEMICAL PRODUCTS (e.g., m?edicament (medication), sodium, h?eparine (heparin), bleu de m?ethyl`ene(methylene blue));A: PHYSICAL AGENTS (e.g., proth`eses (prosthesis), tube (tube), accident (accident), cath?eter (catheter)).Further to our previous work (Wandji Tchami et al., 2013), we have added another semantic axis E STUD-IES, that groups terms related to the scientific work and experiments (e.g., m?ethode (method), hypoth`ese(hypothesis)...).
Such notions are quite frequent in the corpora, while they are missing in the terminologyused.
The only semantic category of Snomed that we ignore in this analysis contains modifiers (e.g.,aigu (acute), droit (right), ant?erieur (anterior)), which are meaningful only in combination with other terms.Besides, such descriptors can occur within medical and non-medical contexts.As stated above, we expect these semantic categories to be indicative of frame elements (FEs), whilethe individual terms should correspond to lexical realizations of those FEs, as in Framenet.
For instance,2http://www.cismef.org/3http://forum.doctissimo.fr/sante/hypertension-problemes-cardiaques/liste sujet-1.htm116the Snomed category DISORDERS should allow us to discover and group under a single label terms thatdenote the same notion (e.g., hypertension (hypertension), ob?esit?e (obesity)) related to the FE DISORDER.The existing terminologies may not provide the entire coverage of the domain notions (Chute et al.,1996; Humphreys et al., 1997; Hole and Srinivasan, 2000; Penz et al., 2004).
For this reason, weattempted to complete the coverage of the Snomed International terminology in relation with the corporaused.
We addressed this question in two ways:?
We computed the plural forms for simple terms that contain one word only.
The motivation for thisprocessing is that the terminologies often record terms in singular forms, while the documents maycontain singular and plural forms of these terms.?
We tried to detect the misspellings of the terms using the string edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966).This measure considers three operations: deletion, addition and substitution of characters.
Eachoperations cost is set to 1.
For instance, the Levenshtein distance between ambolie and embolie is1, that corresponds to the substitution of a by e. The minimal length of the processed words shouldnot be lesser than six characters, because with shorter words the propositions contain too much oferrors.
The motivation for this kind of processing is that it is possible and frequent to find misspelledwords in real documents, especially in the forum discussions (Balahur, 2013).In both cases, the computed forms inherit the semantic type of the terms from the terminology.
Forinstance, ambolie inherits the D DISORDER semantic type of embolie.
Besides, we also added themedication names from the Th?eriaque resource4.
These are assigned to the C CHEMICAL PRODUCTSsemantic type.
The whole resource contains 158,298 entries.2.3 Resource with verbal formsWe have built a resource with inflected forms of verbs: 177,468 forms for 1,964 verbs.
The resourceis built from the information available online5.
The resource contains simple (consulte, consultes, con-sultons (consult)) and complex (ai consult?e, avons consult?e (have consulted)) verbal forms.
This resource isrequired for the lemmatization of verbs (section 3.3).2.4 List of stopwordsThe list of stopwords contains grammatical units, such as prepositions, determinants, pronouns and con-junctions.
It provides 263 entries.3 MethodWe first perform the description of verbs in a way similar to FS and then compare the observationsmade in the two corpora processed.
The proposed method comprises three steps: corpora pre-processing(section 3.1), semantic annotation (section 3.2), and contrastive analysis of verbs (section 3.3).
Themethod relies on some existing tools and on specifically designed Perl scripts.3.1 Corpora pre-processingThe corpora are collected online from the websites indicated above and properly formatted.
The corporaare then analyzed syntactically using the Bonsai parser (Candito et al., 2010).
Its output contains sen-tences segmented into syntactic chunks (e.g., NP, PP, VP) in which words are assigned parts of speech,as shown in the example that follows:Le traitement repose sur les d?eriv?es thiazidiques, plus accessibles, disponibles sous forme dem?edicaments g?en?eriques.
(The treatment is based on thiazidic derivates, more easily accessible, and available as generic drugs.
)((SENT (NP (DET Le) (NC traitement)) (VN (V repose)) (PP (P sur) (NP (DET les) (NC4http://www.theriaque.org/5http://leconjugueur.lefigaro.fr/frlistedeverbe.php117d?eriv?es) (AP (ADJ thiazidiques) (COORD (PONCT ,) (NP (DET les) (ADV plus) (ADJ acces-sibles)) (PONCT ,) (AP (ADJ disponibles)))) (PP (P sous forme de) (NP (NC m?edicaments)(AP (ADJ g?en?eriques)))))))))The syntactic parsing was performed in order to identify the syntactic chunks, nominal and verbal, toprepare the recognition and annotation of the terms they contain and to better the recognition of verbs.The Bonsai parser was chosen: it is adapted for french texts and it provides several hierarchical syntacticlevels within the sentences and phrases.
For instance, the phrase m?edicaments g?en?eriques (generic drugs)is syntactically analyzed as NP: (NP (NC m?edicaments) (AP (ADJ g?en?eriques)))) that contains one NPm?edicaments and two APs g?en?eriques and the final dot.
The VP of the sentence contains the verbrepose (is based).
As we can observe, the output of the Bonsai parser neither provides the lemmas of theforms nor the syntactic dependencies between the constituents.
So our study concentrates on the verbsco-occurences with nouns, noun phrases and some relationnal adjectives.
The further analysis of thecorpora is based on this output.3.2 Semantic annotationThe Bonsai format is first converted into the XML format: we work on the XML-tree structure.
Thesemantic annotation of the corpora is done automatically.
For this task, the Snomed International termi-nology was chosen because it is suitable for french and it offers a better outreach of the french medicallanguage.
We perform the projection of terms from the terminology on the syntactically parsed texts :?
All the chunks (NPs, PPs, APs and VPs) are processed from the largest to the smallest chunks,within which we try to recognize the terminology entries which co-occur with the verbs in thecorpora.
Indeed, at this stage, since our chunker does not provide dependency relations, we canonly work on nouns and noun phrases that co-occur with the verbs.
For instance, the largest chunk(NP (NC m?edicaments) (AP (ADJ g?en?eriques)))) gives m?edicaments g?en?eriques, (generic drugs) that isnot known in the terminology.
We then test m?edicaments (drugs) and g?en?eriques (generic), of whichm?edicaments (drugs) is found in the terminology and tagged with the C CHEMICAL PRODUCTSsemantic type.?
Those VPs in which no terms have been identified are considered to be verbal forms or verbs.Examples of corpora enriched with the semantic information are shown in Figures 1 (expert corpus)and 2 (forum corpus).
In these Figures, verbs are in bold characters, semantic labels for the verbs co-occurents are represented by different colors: DISORDERS in red, FUNCTIONS in purple, ANATOMY inclear blue.
These semantic categories, provided by the terminological resource, label the words that arelikely to correspond to FEs.Figure 1: Examples of annotations in expert corpusWe can see that in the two corpora, there are both short and long sentences.
Besides, the termsrecognized are often atomic.
For instance, we do not recognize complex terms embolie pulmonaire andthrombose du tronc, but their simple atomic components embolie, pulmonaire, thrombose and tronc.Also, some terms match none of the terminology?s entries because they are part of VPs, such as cath?eterin Figure 1.118Figure 2: Examples of annotations in forum corpus.3.3 Automatic analysis of verbsFor the analysis of the verbs, we extract information related to verbs and to the words with which theyoccur.
Currently, only sentences with one VP are processed 8 842 sentences for the expert corpus and10 563 for the forum corpus.?
Lemmatization of verbs.
As we noticed, the syntactic parser?s output does not provide the lemmas.For the lemmatization of the verbs, we use the verbal resource described in section 2.3.
Hence, thecontent of the verbal chunk is analyzed:?
it may contain a simple or complex verbal form that exists in the resource, in which case werecord the corresponding lemma;?
if the whole chunk doesnot appear in the resource, we check out its atomic components: if allor some of these components are known, we record the corresponding lemmas.
This case mayapply to passive structures (a ?et?e conseill?e (has been advised)), insertions (est souvent conseill?e isoften advised) or negations (n?est pas conseill?e (is not advised)): in these cases, the lemmas areavoir ?etre conseiller, ?etre conseiller and ?etre conseiller.
These lemmas will be normalized inthe further step: the head verb will be chosen automatically and considered as the main lemmawithin the verbal phrase;?
finally, the VPs may consist of words that are not known in the verb resource.
These may bemorphologically contructed verbs (r?e?evaluer (reevaluate)) or, words from other parts of speech,errouneously considered as verbs (e.g., t?el?ed?eclaration, art?erielle, stroke).
This is unfortu-nately a very frequent case.?
Extraction of information related to the verb co-occurents.
For the extraction of these information,we consider all the verbs appearing in sentences with one VP.
For each verb, we distinguish between:?
semantically annotated co-occurents, that are considered to be specialized;?
and the remaining content of the sentence (except the words that are part of the stoplist), moreprecisely noun phrases, is considered to contain non specialized co-occurents.In both cases, for each verb, we compute the number and the percentage of words in each of theabove mentionned categories of co-occurents.Finally, we provide a general analysis of the corpora.
For each verb, we compute: the number of occur-rences in each corpus, the total, minimal, maximal and average numbers of co-occurents, both specializedand non-specialized.
On the basis of this information, we analyse the differences and similarities whichmay exist between the use of verbs in the two corpora studied.
The purpose is to provide informationabout the specialized and non-specialized occurrences of verbs.4 Results and Discussion4.1 Corpora pre-processingThe parsing, done with the Bonsai parser, provided the syntactic annotation of corpora into syntacticconstituents.
We have noticed some limitations:?
The Bonsai parser does not perform the lemmatization of lexical units whereas we needed to extractthe verbs lemmas.
The use of external resources made it possible to overcome this limitation;119?
The verbal chunks do not always contain verbal constituents, but can contain other parts of speech(e.g., t?el?ed?eclaration, art?erielle, stroke) and even punctuation.
This is an important limitation forour work, mainly because we focus on verbs.
Therefore, if we cannot extract the verbs properly,this can obviously have a negative impact on the final results.
These limitations, resulting from theBonsai parser, highlight some of the issues that characterize the state of arts as far as the syntaticanalysis for French is concerned.
For the future work, we are planning to try other syntactic parsersfor French.4.2 Semantic annotationConcerning the semantic annotation we have made several observations:?
Some annotations are missing, such as site d?insertion (insertion site) that can be labeled as TOPOG-RAPHY or risque (risk) as FUNCTION.
This limitation is also related to the annotation of the forumcorpus, that often contains misspellings or non-specialized equivalents of the terms.
This limitationmust be addressed in future work in order to detect new terms or the variations of the existing termsto make the annotation more exhaustive;?
Other annotations are erroneous, such as or (ou) in French annotated as CHEMICALS (gold)) inEnglish-language sentences.
In future, the sentences in English will be forehand filtered out at theprocessing stage;?
The terminological variation and the syntactic parsing provided by Bonsai make the recognitionof several complex terms difficult.
As we noticed previously, we mainly recognize simple atomicterms.
For the current purpose, this is not a real limitation: the main objective is to detect the spe-cialized and non-specialized words that co-occur with the verbs.
Still, the number and semantictypes of these words co-occuring with verbs can become biased.
For instance, instead of one DIS-ORDER term embolie pulmonaire (air embolism), we obtain one DISORDER term embolie (embolism)and one ANATOMY term pulmonaire (air).4.3 Automatic analysis of verbsThe contrastive analysis of the words, co-occuring with verbs, provides the main results of the proposedstudy.Corpus TotalVTotalcooccTotalsp?cooccTotal?sp?cooccAsp?coocc/V A?sp?coocc/VExpert Ex 545 17632 8354 9272 15 17Forum Fo 592 10852 5545 5307 9 8Table 2: General information related to the verbs and their co-occurent words: total and average numbersof co-occurentsIn Table 2, we compute the total number of verbs (TotalV), the total number of words co-occuring withverbs per corpus (Totalcoocc), the total number of non specialized co-occurents per corpus (Nsp?coocc),the average number of specialized co-occurents per verb (Asp?coocc/V ), the average number of nonspecialized per verb (A?sp?coocc/V ).
We can notice that the forum corpus provides slightly more verbsthan the expert corpus.
This observation might be considered to be obvious, since the forum corpus is abit larger than the expert corpus.
But if we combine this with the fact that the numbers and averagenumbers of co-occurents (specialized and non-specialized) are higher in the expert corpus, then theobservation start making sense, since these results can be related to the confirmation by (Condaminesand Bourigault, 1999) of the fact that nominal forms tend to be more frequent in specialized texts,whereas verbal forms tend to be more frequent in non-specialized texts.
However, it is important to noticethat some candidates in the list of non-specialized co-occurents have to be filtered out, such as adverbs(conform?ement, r?eguli`erement, pr?ecoc?ement, partiellement) and non relationnal adjectives (variables,inconscients, diff?erents).
The abundance of adverbs in the expert corpus (Table 4) by contrast to the forum120corpus, where their presence seems to be less important, is consistent with the previous work, which showthat non-specialized documents tend to have simpler syntactic and semantic structures (Wandji Tchamiet al., 2013) and less adverbs (Brouwers et al., 2012).Verbs NoccNcooccNsp?coocc%sp?cooccN?sp?coocc%?sp?cooccAsp?cooccA?sp?cooccEx Fo Ex Fo Ex Fo Ex Fo Ex Fo Ex Fo Ex Fo Ex Foaugmenter 21 14 122 52 62 26 51.5 56.2 60 26 48.4 43.7 2.9 1.8 2.8 1.8causer 5 7 26 27 17 19 72 68.2 9 8 28 31.72 3.4 2.7 1.8 1.1favoriser 10 6 56 22 38 17 70.5 77.3 18 5 29.4 22.6 3.8 2.8 1.8 0.8prescrire 6 29 30 108 16 71 58.9 69.7 14 37 41 30.2 2.6 2.4 2.3 1.2provoquer 7 15 60 64 32 37 57 70.2 28 27 42.9 29.7 4.5 2.4 4 1.8risquer 7 7 18 13 12 11 1.7 1.5 6 2 0.8 0.2 78.5 90 21.42 10signaler 12 4 73 14 32 7 46.9 48.3 41 7 53 51.6 2.6 1.7 3.4 1.7subir 4 24 20 98 15 54 76.1 63 5 44 23.8 36.9 3.7 2.5 1.2 1.8traiter 24 17 107 67 66 34 65 60.2 41 33 34.9 39.7 2.7 2 1.7 1.9Table 3: Information on some verbs that occur in Expert Ex and Forum Fo corporaIn Table 3, we give similar information but for with individual verbs.
For each verb, in every corpus,we compute the number of occurence (Nocc), the number of words (Ncoocc) occuring with the verb, thenumber of specialized co-occurents (Nsp?coocc), the percentage of specialized co-occurents (%sp?coocc),the number of non specialized co-occurents (N?sp?coocc), the percentage of non specialized co-occurents(%?sp?coocc), the average number of specialized co-occurents (Asp?coocc) and the average number of nonspecialized co-occurents (A?sp?coocc).
These verbs are chosen because they occur in the two corporastudied and because they are sufficiently frequent as compared to others.
In our opinion, these verbs mayreceive specialized and non-specialized meanings according to their usage.
Indeed, Table 3 shows thatthese verbs behave differently according to the corpus.
On the one hand, there are verbs (e.g., augmenter,favoriser, signaler, traiter, risquer) that occur with an important number of specialized co-occurents in theExperts Ex corpus while they have lower numbers of specialized co-occurents in the Forum Fo corpus.On the other hand, there are verbs (e.g., causer, subir, prescrire) that have more specialized co-occurentsin the Forum corpus than in the Expert corpus.
If we consider the number of occurrences of these verbs,we can definitely notice that some of them (e.g.
causer and subir) regularly occur with more specializedco-occurents in the Expert corpus (although with lower number of specialized co-occurents) than in theForum corpus.
This means that their frames involve different numbers of specialized co-occurents, thatare higher in the Expert corpus.In table 4, we show the frequent co-occurents for five verbs.
We can propose two main observations:?
Some verbs involve an important number of specialized co-occurents, that have different semantictypes in the Expert and Forum corpora.
For instance, the verb augmenter provides a total of 88specialized co-occurents that belong to nine semantic types (D, P , S , J , C, F , T , L and A).
Themost frequent among them are F (27), D (18), T (15), and P (9), and occur mostly in the Expertcorpus.
These might be more general verbs, with weaker specific selectional restrictions.?
Other verbs frequently occur with specialized terms that belong to a specific semantic type.
Thismost frequent label can be specific to one corpus only or simultaneously to the two.
For instance,for the verb prescrire, the most frequent labels are the same in the two corpora: C, J , P and Tterms.
Traiter frequently occurs, in the two corpora, with C and D terms.The general observation is that, for a given verb, the Expert corpus shows more sophisticated syntacticstructures with higher number of specialized co-occurents.
Besides, some verbs may show similar ordifferent behavior in the two corpora studied.
According to the objectives of the proposed work, we con-sider that an important presence of specialized terms in a sentence or corpus indicates a very specializeduse and meaning of the verbs.
Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data support this first studyand results.121sp?

This work is intended to enhance the previous study (Wandji-2013).Indeed, the method used has changed from semi-automatic to completely automatic; and a new task isperformed in order to enhance the annotation process : the syntactic parsing of the corpora.
Also, somenew materials are used namely the Bonsai parser, the resource of verbal forms, the stoplist.
There is anincrease in the quantity of data analyzed; all the verbs of the various corpora were considered in thisstudy.
The annotation is based on an approach similar to Frame Semantics, considering the fact thatsemantic information related to the verbs co-occurents are provided through the use of a medical termi-nology.
Though our method is still under development, it has helped to notice that some verbs regularlyco-occur with specialized terms in a given context or corpus while in another, the same verbs mostlyoccurs with general language words.
This observation takes us back to the issue of text readability, de-scribed in the introduction.
Indeed, the verbs whose occurences are characterized by the predominanceof specialized terms, can be considered as sources of reading difficulties for non experts in medecine.6 Future workWe plan to extend this study in different ways.
The recognition of the verb neighbors must be improvedwith the main objective to make the annotations more exhaustive.
In this study, we have portrayed theverbs behaviors and their relations with the words with which they occur in the corpora.
However, ouraim is to automatically identify the verbs arguments, among his co-occurents.
We also plan to peforman automatic distinction between : the syntactic functions (subject, object, etc.)
of the verbs argumentsand the core and non-core elements.
We also plan to compute the dependency relations within sentences,122either by using another chunker or by integrating to our treatment chain a tool that can perform this task.In addition, we will concentrate on the description of semantic frames of the medical verbs and on theidentification of other eventual reading difficulties that might be related to the verbs usages in the corpora.As indicated above, we processed sentences that have only one verbal phrase (8 842 for the Forumcorpus and 10 563 for the Expert corpus).
In the future, we will process other sentences, coordinatedor subordinated, which will be segmented into simple propositions before the processing.
Another pointis related to the exploitation of these findings for the simplification of medical documents at two levels:syntactic and lexical.
Finally, working at a fine-grained verbal semantics, we can distinguish the uses ofverbs according to whether their semantics and frames remain close or indicate different meanings.AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge the support of the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) and theDGA, under the Tecsan grant ANR-11-TECS-012.ReferencesS Atkins, M Rundell, and H Sato.
