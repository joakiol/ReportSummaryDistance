TheATN is proposed as a tool for assistin~ the linguist todevelop systsmatic descriptions of ~ e  data.
It isassumed that the typical user will interface with thesystem at a point where an AEN and lexicon have bem~developed.
The ATN is developed from the theoreticalmodel chosen by the l ingu is t .Once the ~ i s  imp lememtad as a cooputat ional  pro-cedure, the user enters test data, displays structures,the lexicon, and edits the grammr to producea refined A~\] grarmar description.
The displayed struc-tures provide a labeled structural inremyretation of theinput string based on the lin=~uistic model used.
Trac-ing'of the parse may be used to follow the process ofbuilding the structural interpretation.
Computationalimplemm~tation requires giving attention to the detailsof the interrelationships of gr~.matical rules and theinteraction between the grammar rule system and the lex-ical representation.
Testing the grammr against dataforces a level of systemization that is significantlymore rigorous than discussion oriented evaluation ofgra~er sys ~m,.The model provides a meens of organizing strut-rural descriptions at any level, from surfacesyntax to deep propositional inrerpreta=icms.2.
A nemmrk m~el  may be used Co re~resent differ-ent theoretical approaches Co grammr definition.The graphical representation of a gramrar permit-ted by the neuaork model is a relati~ly clearand precise way to express notions about struc-t~/re.3.Computational simulation of the gramsr enablessystematic tracing of subc~xx~nts and testingagainst text data.4.Grimes (2), in a series of linguistics workshops, d ~strafed the utility of the network model ~ in envi-~u~nts  wh~e computational testir~ of grammrs was r~tpossible.

Tnc~h ~amy systems have be~developed, l i t t le  attent ion has been g iv~ to =eatingan interactive grarmar modeling system for an individualwith highly developed linguistics skills but poorly de-veloped c~putational skills.The individual involved in field Lir~=%~istics isconcerned with developing concise workable descriptionsof some corpus of deta in a ~ven language.
Perti~,7~problems in developing rules for incerpreting surfaces~-uctn~res are proposed and discussed in relation tothe da~a.
In field l i r~t ics  applications, this in-wives developing a rmxor~my of structural types follow-ed by hypothesizing onderlying rule systems which pro-vide the highest level of data integration at a2.
Desi=~ ConsideratiorsThe gm~ral  das i~ goal for the grammr rasingsys~ described here is to provide a tool for develop-ing experimentally drive~, systematic representationmodels of language data.
Engineering of a full Lmguage~erstamdimg system is not the ~f~mm-y focus of theefforts described in this paper.
Ideally, one wouldLike Co provide a tool which would attract applied lin-guists to use such a syst~n as a simulation environmen=for model developmen=.design goals for the systems described are:i.
Ease of use for both novice and expert modes of.operation,2.
Perspi cuity of gr~m~r representation,3.
Support for a variety of linguistic theories,4.
Trarmportability to a variety of systems.The p~totype grammr design sys~ consists of agram~r gemerator, a~ editor, and a monitor.
The f~mc-tion of U%e gr;~.~ editor is to provide a means ofdefining and mm%iv~lating gr~mar descriptions w~thoucrequiring the user  to work in  a specific programingl angu~e env~uL~,=L~.

The ed i tor  knows shout the b/N envirormen~and can provide assistsmce to the user as needed.The monitor's function is co handle input and out-puc of g r~-~ and lexicon f i l es ,  manage displays andtraces of parsir~s, provide o~sultation on the sysranuse as needed, and enable the user to cycle from editorto parsing with mi~m,~ effort.
The monitor can also beused to provide facilities for studying gram~r effi-ciemcy.

Two In Dlemmutatiors of Gr i t  Tes~ Sysr~-sTo deu~lop some understanding on the design amdimpleremrmtion requirements for a sysr~n as spec-ified in the previous section, D~o experimenr.al gr~'-~"resting systems have been developed.
A partial A~ im-pl~m~nta=ion was dune by ~_hler(A) in a system (SNOPAR)~dnich provided some interactive gr.~Tr~T and developmentfacilities.
SNOPAR imcorporated several of the basicfeatures of a grammr generator and monitor, with alimited ed i to r ,  a gra-m=~ gererator and a number ofother fea=uras.Both SNOPAR and ADEPT are implemenred in SNO~OLand both have been ~:rarmpcrr~ed across opera .

TOPS-20 co I~M's ~;) .
For implemm~retion of rex=ediCir~ and program grin,mar gemerar.ion, the S~OBOL&language is  reasonable.
However, the Lack of ccmprehen-sive list storage marm@snentis a l~n~tat io~ on the ex-tension of ~ implerenre=ion ~o a full natural lan-guage ~mdersr~ sysr~n.

One of the goals in =he design of ~.~3PAR was toin~'c~,~ce a notation which was easier to read than theLISP reprasemta=ion most frequently used.Two basic formats have been used for wr i~ng grab-mars in ~qOPA.~.
One separates dm conrex~c-free syntaxtype operations f-con the rests and actions of the gram-mar.

t~itiple arcs between states are differentiatedby specifying the order nu~er  of the arc or by dis-playing all arcs to the user and requesting selectionof the desired arc.N~ arcs are inserted in the network by U~e Imand.
-vhenever an arc insert is performed all arcs fromthe state are nurbered and displayed.
After the userspecifies the nu~er  of the arc that the n~ arc is tofollow, the arc information is entered.Arcs nay be reordered by specifying the startingstate for the arcs of inCerast using the 0 command.
~euser is then requested ~o specify the r~ ordering of ~Searcs.Insertion and deletion of a state requires that theeditor determine the sta~as which r.'my be reachedthe new state as well as finding which arcs terminate onthe n~4 state.
Once this information has been establish-ed, the arc information may be entered.~nen a state is deleted, all arcs which inmediatelyleave the state or which enter the state fr~n otherstares are removed.
Error ?onditioos ex is t~ in thenetwork as a result of the deletion are then reported.The user then e i~er  verifies the requested deletion andcorrects any errors or cancels the request.Grarmar files are stored in a list format.

~he user is able tofocus on the grammr model and not on the specific pro-gra~ming requir~r~nts.
