We evaluate both the theo-retical possibility of transferring frames andthe possibility of performing it using avail-able lexical resources.
We add the frame in-formation to an extract of the Swedish sideof the Kotus and JRC-Acquis corpora usingan automatic frame labeler and copy it to theFinnish side.
We focus on evaluating the re-sults to get an estimation on how often theparallel sentences can be said to express thesame frame.
This sheds light on the questions:Are the same situations in the two languagesexpressed using different frames, i.e.
are theframes transferable even in theory?
How wellcan the frame information of running text betransferred from one language to another?1 IntroductionTo our knowledge, there is no ongoing effort to cre-ate a framenet for Finnish.
This experiment gives in-formation on whether it is feasible to build a prelimi-nary framenet for Finnish by transferring the frameswith their lexical units from Swedish.
The buildingof semantically annotated language resources fromscratch is a costly and time consuming effort.
Inthis experiment, we test the feasibility of utilizingSwedish and Finnish lexical resources for building aFinnish framenet.Transferring lexical units from Swedish toFinnish is possible because of the wordnet connec-tions of both languages: both the Swedish wordnetand the Finnish wordnet are linked to the Princetonwordnet.
This connection is described in more detailin Section 2.We evaluate the transferability of the frames andtheir lexical units from Swedish to Finnish.
In theevaluation, we use Swedish?Finnish parallel corporato see whether the same sentence is expressed usingthe same frames in both languages.
Using parallelcorpora, we can evaluate not only the theoreticallysimilar content of frames in two different languages,but also their use in actual texts.The idea of semantic role transfer across paral-lel corpora is not novel (see Section 2.3), but to ourknowledge, the use of linked lexical resources pro-posed here is.
The language pair Swedish?Finnishis also one for which this methodology has notbeen attempted earlier.
With our experiment wecan see whether transferring the frame informationfrom Swedish to Finnish could work, given that thelanguages are not demonstrably related, and struc-turally quite different.
The work presented hereconsequently provides a data point for the evalua-tion of the language-independence of this kind ofmethodology, which can arguably only be convinc-ingly demonstrated by actually attempting to apply iton a range of typologically diverse languages (Ben-der, 2011).From a more practical point of view, there maywell be as much Finnish?Swedish as Finnish?English parallel data, since Finnish and Swedishare the two official languages of Finland, and allpublic documents must by law be available in bothlanguages, and for practical reasons also a largeamount of other texts.
In addition, despite their non-relatedness and large structural differences, the two8languages have a long history of contact and bilin-gualism.
Finnish has borrowed words and struc-tures from Swedish on a large scale, and the lexi-cal semantics of the two languages have convergedin many domains.
This means that we may expectframes to transfer well across the two languages,whereas the structural differences may make usmore pessimistic about the transferability of frameelements.2 Language Resources2.1 Wordnet ConnectionsWordnets are lexical databases that group words ofa language into synonym sets ?
or synsets ?
eachsynset supposedly expressing one distinct concept inthe language.
Wordnets further provide general def-initions of the synsets, and encode the semantic rela-tions between the synsets.
Typically they are mono-lingual, but efforts have been made to produce mul-tilingual wordnets as well; see e.g.
Vossen (1998).FinnWordNet (Lind?n and Carlson, 2010) is awordnet for Finnish that complies with the formatof the Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998).It was built by translating the Princeton WordNet 3.0synsets into Finnish by human translators.
It is opensource and contains 117 000 synsets.
The Finnishtranslations were inserted into the PWN structure re-sulting in a bilingual lexical database.SweFN++ is an integrated open-source lexicalresource for Swedish (Borin et al, 2010; Borin,2010).
It includes the Swedish framenet (SweFN)and Swesaurus, a Swedish wordnet.
The wordnethas been semi-automatically assembled from freelyavailable Swedish lexical resources (Borin and Fors-berg, 2011), and part of it has been linked to the CoreWordNet, a 5000-synset subset of PWN.
All re-sources in SweFN++ are linked together on the wordsense level using the persistent sense identifiers ofthe SweFN++ pivot resource SALDO, a large-scalelexical-semantic resource (Borin et al, 2008; Borinand Forsberg, 2009).
Using these links, we can col-lect a set of 434 frames and 2 694 word senses thathave a direct PWN ?
Swedish wordnet ?
SweFN?
FinnWordNet connection.
Using these connec-tions, we can transfer the frame information of thewords from Swedish to Finnish.
We used the Korppipeline (Borin et al, 2012) to analyze the Swedishpart of the parallel text to get hold of the SALDOsense identifiers.
The analysis is not able to distin-guish senses that do not differentiate themselves for-mally (by different word forms or morphosyntacticdescriptions).2.2 Framenet and the Semantic LabelerFramenets are lexical databases that define seman-tic relations.
The best-known framenet is BerkeleyFrameNet which is based on the theory of frame se-mantics (Fillmore, 1976).
SweFN is built using thesame principles as the Berkeley Framenet (Ruppen-hofer et al, 2006) of English.
The frames are mostlythe same as in English.In the experiment, we use an automatic seman-tic role labeler for Swedish, developed by Johanssonet al (2012).
The labeler is based on the Swedishframenet and it uses the same frame and frame ele-ment labels.2.3 Related WorkFrom a methodological point of view, the firstquestion to ask should be whether the semanticframes are meaningful in both languages: for in-stance, if the Swedish FrameNet has defined a frameSELF_MOTION and a list of associated frame ele-ments (SELF_MOVER, GOAL, PATH etc.
), does itmake sense to define an identical frame in a FinnishFrameNet?
This question has been studied by Pad?
(2007) for English?German and English?French,and although most frames were cross-linguisticallymeaningful, a number of interesting discrepancieswere found.
Whether the number of discrepancies ishigher in a pair of more typologically different lan-guages is an important question.As far as we are aware, there has been no previ-ous attempt in using multilingual WordNets or simi-lar lexicons when deriving lexical units in frames innew languages.
The WordNet?FrameNet combina-tion has seen some use in monolingual applications:for instance, Burchardt et al (2005) and Johanssonand Nugues (2007) attempted to extend the coverageof FrameNet by making use of WordNet.
Pad?
andLapata (2005a) used word alignment in sentence-aligned parallel corpora to find possible lexical unitsin new languages.There have been several studies of the feasibil-ity of automatically producing the role-semantic an-9notation in new languages, although never for lan-guages as structurally dissimilar as Swedish andFinnish.
Pad?
and Lapata (2005b) projected anno-tation from English to German, and Johansson andNugues (2006) implemented a complete pipeline forEnglish?Swedish by (1) automatic annotation on theEnglish side; (2) annotation transfer; and (3) traininga Swedish semantic role labeler using the automati-cally produced annotation.3 Frames from Swedish to Finnish3.1 Outline of the ExperimentWe start off by locating such Swedish word sensesthat are both represented in SweFN and linked toPWN in two Finnish?Swedish parallel corpora.
Thesentences that include such a word make up the eval-uation data set.
After this, the Swedish half is en-riched with frame labels using the framenet-basedsemantic role labeler for Swedish.After running the semantic labeler on the evalu-ation data, we pick the 20 most commonly occur-ring frames from both corpora.
For each of themost common frames, we pick the 6 first occur-rences for closer scrutiny.
Due to the differing na-ture of Swedish and Finnish, we make one changebefore selecting the 20 most frequent frames: We ex-clude the frame which is evoked (erroneously) onlyby the Swedish indefinite articles en/ett ?
homony-mous with the numeral ?one??
among the 6 first oc-currences.
We take the 21st most frequent frame in-stead because there are no articles in Finnish.
Tosum up, the frames under examination are selectedbased on the frequency of the frame, and the sen-tences including the frame are selected in the orderin which they occur.After picking 120 (6 x 20) sentences from bothcorpora, the correctness of the semantic labeler ismanually checked.
A linguist marks the correctnessof both the frame and the frame element label.
Atthis stage, the linguist does not consider the trans-ferability of the frame, but merely checks the outputof the automatic role labeler, marking the frame andthe frame element either correct or incorrect.
E.gproblematic analyses caused by polysemous wordsare marked incorrect.
We check the output of thelabeler before analyzing the transferability of theframes because if the frame information is incorrectin the Swedish text to begin with, there is no pointin transferring it to Finnish.After checking the Swedish frame information,the Swedish?Finnish parallel sentences are com-pared.
Two native Finnish speakers estimate,whether the frame and frame element label is trans-ferable to Finnish or not.
Because FrameNet isbased on Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1976), accord-ing to which the meanings of most words can best beunderstood by a description of a situation, the work-ing hypothesis is that the semantic frames should bemore or less language neutral.
Hence, the semanticframe we assign for a certain situation in Swedish,should be transferable to Finnish.In addition to the theoretical frame transferability,we also report the practical applicability of the trans-fer via the wordnet connections.
We check whetherthe Swedish word is expressed in the Finnish par-allel corpus with a word that has a direct link fromthe Swedish wordnet to the Finnish wordnet via thePrinceton Wordnet.
If there is no direct Wordnet linkfrom the Swedish word to the Finnish one, we re-port whether the Finnish word used in the sentenceand the Finnish word linked to the Swedish word viawordnets are in the same synset.In sum, we manually evaluate whether the 20most commonly occurring frames of the Swedishtest sentences are the same in the equivalent Finnishsentences.
After reporting whether the frames areequivalent in both languages, we evaluate, howmany of the frame element labels can be transferredto Finnish.3.2 The Test CorporaPresumably, transferability of the frames betweenparallel corpora depends on the translation of thecorpus.
Our hypothesis is that if the translatorfollows the original expression very carefully, theframes can be more similar than in a more freelytranslated text.
To see whether the transferability ofthe frames varies according to a corpus, we used twotest corpora.The test corpora consist of extracts from theJRC-Acquis Corpus (Steinberger et al, 2006) andthe KOTUS Swedish?Finnish Parallel Corpus (Re-search Institute for the Languages of Finland, 2004).Both are Swedish?Finnish parallel corpora that aresentence aligned.
In both corpora, the text type is10formal: the former is a collection of legislative textand the latter consists of press releases of differentFinnish companies.4 ResultsThe evaluation consists of three parts: First andforemost, we concentrate on estimating whether theframe used in Swedish can be transferred to Finnisheven in theory.
These results are presented in Sec-tion 4.1.
If the sentence is expressed using the sameframes, we also report how many of the frame ele-ments encoded correctly in Swedish are realized inFinnish (Section 4.2).
In Section 4.3, we discuss thepossibility of transferring the frames via the word-net connections.
The results for the two differentcorpora are presented separately enabling us to seewhether the text type impacts frame transferring.4.1 Possibility of Transferring FramesIn Tables 1 and 2, the first column lists the 20 mostfrequent frames of the evaluation corpora.
The sec-ond column shows that for all 20 frames, we tookthe first six Swedish occurrences.
The third columnshows how many of the Swedish frame labels arecorrect.
Finally, the right-most column portrays howmany of the correct Swedish frames can be trans-ferred to Finnish.
The result we are mostly inter-ested in is the difference between the third and thefourth columns.As can be seen from Tables 1 and 2, most ofthe correct labels for Swedish are transferable toFinnish.
In the JRC-Acquis corpus, the semantic la-beler succeeded in 75%, and 72% of the frame la-bels can be transferred to Finnish.
The correspond-ing success rates for the Kotus corpus are 80% and72%.Many of the words that are not correctly labeledin Swedish occur in idiomatic expressions, and bychance, some idioms are so frequent in the corpusthat they end up to our evaluation corpus.
E.g.
theidiom tr?da i kraft / astua voimaan / come into effectis expressed in the same way in both Swedish andFinnish (lit.
?tread into force?).
In both languages, averb usually belonging to the frame SELF_MOTIONis used in this idiom, but in the idiom, the meaningof it cannot be said to be expressing self motion.Some sentences in which the frames are consid-Frame N Correct Correctin Swe in FinBeing_necessary 6 6 6Calendric_unit 6 6 6Capability 6 3 3Coming_to_believe 6 0 0Commitment 6 6 6Deciding 6 6 6Dimension 6 5 4Leadership 6 6 6Part_orientational 6 4 4Political_locales 6 6 6Possession 6 2 1Questioning 6 1 1Removing 6 6 6Request 6 6 6Scrutiny 6 6 6Self_motion 6 0 0Substance 6 4 4Suitability 6 6 5Text 6 5 5Using 6 6 5Total (N) 120 90 86Total (%) 100 75 72Table 1: Frames from the JRC-Acquis CorpusFrame N Correct Correctin Swe in FinAssistance 6 6 6Attempt_suasion 6 6 6Becoming 6 6 3Business 6 6 6Calendric_unit 6 6 6Capability 6 3 3Change_position_ 6 6 5on_a_scale_increaseCommitment 6 5 5Create_physical_artwork 6 0 0Create_representation 6 1 1Deciding 6 6 6Dimension 6 3 2Employing 6 6 6Leadership 6 4 4Measure_duration 6 6 6People 6 6 6Possession 6 3 1Relative_time 6 5 5Supporting 6 6 2Transfer 6 6 6Total (N) 120 96 85Total (%) 100 80 72Table 2: Frames from the Kotus Corpus11ered non-transferable already on a theoretical levelare expressed in Finnish completely without theframe, as demonstrated in Example (1) and (2).

(2) Seitj?iremainedkuitenkinstillalkuper?ist?originaltavoitettagoalheikommaksi.weaker.However, it remained weaker than what was theoriginal goal.In the Swedish example (1), the word mindre?smaller?
is used when expressing the decrease ofeconomical growth.
The word mindre fits the frameDIMENSION, but it is used in a figurative way.
TheFinnish parallel sentence could be expressed us-ing the direct translation pienempi ?smaller?
but thetranslation is different.
Mindre in the Finnish Ko-tus corpus is translated as heikompi ?weaker?, whichis not expressing dimension even in a metaphoricalway.When focusing only on the correct Swedish la-bels, transferring frames seems to be beneficial, asreported in Table 3.
The success rate of a theoreticalpossibility to use Swedish as a source language forFinnish frames is 92%.Correct Transferable Success %Frames FramesKotus 90 86 96%JRC-A 96 85 89%Total 186 171 92%Table 3: The Success Rate of Frame TransferTable 3 sums up the comparison of the two cor-pora.
The difference (7%) between the corpora isnot remarkable, so based on these test corpora, theimpact of the translation type is not big.
In otherwords, in both corpora, the correct Swedish framescan be transferred to Finnish successfully.4.2 Success of Transferring Frame ElementsWhen the sentence is expressed using the sameframes in both languages, we also report, how manyof the frame elements encoded correctly in Swedishare realized in Finnish.
These results are presentedin Tables 4 and 5.
The numbers show how benefi-cial it is to transfer the frame element labels of theSwedish semantic labeler to Finnish.The most common frame elements of the Swedishcorpora are listed in the first column.
We scrutinizesuch elements in detail which occur in the corporaat least four times.
The rest are added up and pre-sented on the last lines of the tables.
The secondcolumn shows the frequency of the frame element,while the third column gives the number of correctframe element labels in the Swedish corpora.
Thelast column shows the number of transferable frameelements.As can be seen from Table 6 that sums up the re-sults of the frame element transfer, frame element la-bels do not transfer from Swedish to Finnish as wellas the frame labels.
The success rate of the frametransfer is 92%, where as the frame elements can besuccessfully transferred in 83% of the cases.In the Kotus corpus, 75% of the frame element la-bels are transferable.
However, there is a differencebetween the two corpora: In the JRC-Acquis corpus,91% of the elements can be transferred to Finnish.4.3 Transferring Frames via WordnetsNext we report how many of the Swedish frame-evoking words are expressed using such words thathave the same wordnet identifier in Finnish.
If theparallel sentences are not expressed using words thatare equivalent in the wordnets, we examine whetherthe words are in equivalent synsets.
This informa-tion is needed when estimating the usefulness of lex-ical resources and their internal links in the frametransferring.In Tables 7 and 8, the first row displays the totalnumber of frame-evoking words.
The second rowshows how many of the frames are transferable toFinnish even in theory.
The numbers on the thirdrow reflect the possibility of using the WordNet con-nections in frame transferring; this number showshow many of the words under examination are ex-pressed both in Swedish and in Finnish with theequivalent wordnet words.
The fourth row showshow many of the words are not directly linked witheach other but are located in equivalent synsets.

Our hypothesis was that we could get bet-ter results when looking at all the words in a synset.This appears to be a wrong assumption: There areonly 2 words that come from the same synset thatare not equivalent words used in the translations.The numbers on the fifth rows are remarkably big,especially when compared to the number of real-ized synonyms on the fourth row.
These 47 wordscould (or should) be located in the same synset as thewords in question.
If the wordnets were complete,i.e.
if all words that could be in the same synsetwere in the same synset, the theoretically transfer-able LUs would be 82% (70/85) and 65% (56/86).5 Conclusion and Future WorkThe main point of the experiment was to see if build-ing a preliminary Finnish framenet and labeling se-mantic roles for Finnish using Swedish resourcesis feasible at all.
In particular, we wanted to seewhether the same situations are expressed using thesame frames in both languages and whether it is pos-sible to transfer the frames and frame elements withtheir lexical units from one language to the other.In our experiment, we have evaluated how wellthe frames and frame elements can be transferredfrom a Swedish corpus to its Finnish parallel corpus.We have shown that in theory, 92% of the correctSwedish frame labels and 83% of the correct frame13element labels can be transferred to Finnish.We also investigated whether linked wordnetscould be used for the transfer of frame-evokingwords between Swedish and Finnish.
The resultshere are more ambiguous, however.
On the onehand, only about half of the words could be linkedin this way.
On the other hand, it turns out that thisin part is because of many synsets being incompletein these wordnets which are still under construction.Thus we should not dismiss out of hand the useful-ness of lexical-semantic resources such as wordnetsfor the task of cross-language frame transfer, butrather explore further how the knowledge encodedin them could be best put to use.The result of our experiment encourages us to findways of performing frame transfer automatically.This can be accomplished using a word aligned par-allel corpus for Swedish and Finnish.
The automaticword alignment of Finnish is generally seen as acomplicated task because of the free constituent or-der and rich morphology of Finnish.
However, ourfuture work is to examine the success of using au-tomatic word alignment, e.g.
Giza++, in automat-ically transferring the frame information from onelanguage to another.AcknowledgementsThe research presented here was supported by theSwedish Research Council (the project SwedishFramenet++, VR dnr 2010-6013) and by the Uni-versity of Gothenburg through its support of theCentre for Language Technology and its support ofSpr?kbanken (the Swedish Language Bank).
