S}3CMaximal flexibility in controll ing CFG parsing can be obtained in!,tie active (:hart parser \[Kay80\]\[WinogrM8a\].
h~ this algorith,,/qchemata, ~, parsing p,'ocGqs i,':; taken as a sequence of attachingan active or inactive arc to Chmq, one at each time.Though each attachment of an arc creates a set of arc.
': tobe ~ttached, the churl parser in a/~eneral foJm does not atttmh6}~3them'in{mediately, but registers them in Agenda , A schedulerdecides which arc in Agenda is to be attchcd next.
Because noa priori ordering of arc attachment is assumed, one can realizeabitrary, flexible control mechanisms in this schemata.llowever, such a maximal flexibility is obtained at the cost ofefficiency.
The scheduler has to be invoked at each cycle to decidewhich arc to be attached, l:'urthermore, when arcs are created,we have to take away tile arcs which exist in Agenda or in Chart,before re.gistering them in Agenda.
The same ares may exist tothe arcs only whose leftmost constituents are filled by inactivearcs.
Because of lhe reachabilily eondilion, we also have to checkapplicability of rules to all the inactive arcs in the right neighbor,whenever an active arc is attached.
Such repeated cheekings canbe avoided in more restricted algorithms.ht KGW-t-p, we use an Agenda?like list (S-list- suspendinglist) but unlike the Agenda in the active chart parser, it onlykeeps tile arcs which will be tried after the prelerred ones fail.The other created arcs are attached immediately, instead oftlle scheduler, the SBC has its own control scheme for buildingPPTs mechanically from left to right.
The scheduler of KGW-I-pis more like a demon watching the SBC.
When it finds lesspreferred PPTs (arcs) generated, it jumps out to store them inthe S-list.
Or when it finds the SBC goes to deadend, it decideswhich suspended PPTs in the S-list should be resumed.The SBC in KGW+p uses two data structures, one for inac-.
tive arcs and the other for active arcs in Chart.
As in Fig.
2,the inactive arcs from vertex i to j are stored ill P(i, j )and  theactive arcs with ending vertices i are stored in G(i).
We call thearcs in P(i, j) inactive PPTs and the arcs iu G(i) active PPTs.Both P(i, j) and G(i) are realized as flavor instances of each type(P-Flavor and G-Flavor).V, _Vja~la~\[ of the sentence~ aaaaa5G(2} kepps the act ive  PPTs whoseua i t ing  const i tuents  ~II1 be f i l l edt)L t2 2 a c,ye 2: !

Ifc~.PI'T is inactive, the remainders is an empty list.We call the leftmost constituent of the remaindersthe waili'ng constiluenL Note that the waiting con-stituents of PPTs in G(i) are to be filled by inactivet 'PTs with starting vertex i.
(5)pairs of a larger PPT which incorporates c-PPTas the leftmost constituent and the rule which ww~Jused to create the larger PPT.
'Because PPT-instances keep (1)., (4) as the arcs in Char~,they can be suspended ill the S-list (not immediately sLored inP(i, j) or G(i )) and resumed afterwards freely.
(5) is used toavoid redundant processings in the retrial phases (see Seclion 4).The basic cycle of parsing is implemented as a set of method,~e l  P--Flavor When P(i, j)-instanee is triggered,, the methods inP-Flavor perform the following operations for each PPT storedin p(i ,j).o (Extension of Aclive PPTs)look for active PPTs in G(i)which can incorporate the PPT as the leftmost constituentof the remainders, and create new PPTs?
(New Rule Applicalion)look for rules wimse leftmost con-stituents in rhs can be unified with the PPT and whosenonterminals in lhs can reach to the nonterminals of thewaiting constituents of active PPTs in G(i), and appliesthem to create new PPTsBy storing newly created PPTs in the corresponding P(i', j')or G(j ~ ) immediately, a naive bottom-up, breadth-first and left--to-right parsing with top-down filtering can be easily realized asfollows.
(1)After completion of the basic cycle, P(i, j)-instancetriggers the execution of the basic cycle in P(i-1, j)-instance(2)A trigger to P(0, j)-instance is taken as a trig-ger to the SBC-manager.
The manager creates newPPTs by using the rules A ~ aj+i (aj+l is the j+ lth words), stores them in P(j+I, j+l) and triggersP(j+ I, j+ l)oinstance(3)Parsing is started by triggering P(0,/0)-intance(This leads to the triggering of P(1, 1) in (2)).The basic control scheme of the SBC is the same as the aboveone.
However, in KGWTp, after each basic cycle of creatingnew PPTs, newly created PPTs are rated by the PRC and thescheduler suspends less preferred (active or inactive) PPTs bystoring them in the S-list.
Only preferred ones are stored inC0rrgsponding P(i', j") or G(j" ) m parallel.
Thus, though thescheduler loosely controls the whole process, the SBC analyzessentences basically from left to right in a breadth-first mannerby its own efficient control scheme.
Note that the basic controlscheme is an extended one of the algorithm proposed by V. Pratt\[Pratt?5\] to deal with n-sty rules.6844.

These new PP't'srepresent different hypotheses b~se(l on the same l)ottom.-up ev-idence, the incorporated PP'j'.The PR,(II computes the PVs (plausibility vMues) of these differeat hypotheses by invoking a package of preferet,ce rules.

And we do not use (4) (the PV from top-down) in thisaddition.In the present experilnent~ after the PRC computes the PVsof larger PPTs incorporating the same PPT, the scheduler sus-pends PPTs which have low PVs cornpared with the most prefer-able PPT.
That is, if the difference between the highest PV andthe PV of a PPT exceeds a certain (predetermined) threshold,the PPuC suspends the PPT.6 ExperimentsWe conducted various experiments by using KGW+p.
In thissection, we will show the experiment ofdisambiguating sentencescontaining the word that.
That can be taken as a pronoun, adetenninner, a relative pronoun, a complementizer, a noun as anantecedent of a relative clause, a conjunction for an appositionalclause or adverbial clause, an adverb, etc.The followings are examples we realize as preference rules inthe experiment.
(Note that, in the present experiment, the PVs6iven by independent evidences are classified into 5 ranks, mostpreferred (+2), more preferred (+1), neutral (0), less preferred(-1) aud least preferred (-2)).686( prul e: cat, that: type head: t ncor~oatt b| e-cases ( (  I ncomp-case:U'ee-cond ( :node- tes t  (= hi.

are often collo-cated with appositional c auses.
When the head of anoun phrase preceding that is one of su& nouns, theapposilional clause interpolation is more preferred.
(2) Wheat the verb in the sentence is one of the verbssubcategorized by that-clause, the complemeMizer inoterpretation is most preferrred.
(3) When the word so or such appears iu the preced-ing part of the sentence, tile adverbial phrase inter-prelation is most preferred.
(4) PP.-attachments over clauses are less preferred.
(5) Omission of relative pronouns is less preferred.
(6) The pronoun and determiner interprelaliou ofthat are less preferred in written texts.
(7) Different usages of a verb have different prefer-ences.
The verb to fell, for example, has five usages,'to tell sth to *b', 'to tell slh', 'to tell sb sth', 'to tell sblhaf-cl' and 'to tell'.
The last usage (the intransitiveusage) has the least preference.etc.An example of actuM preference rules is given in Fig.
6.
Thesentences in the following are used in the experinmr, t.1.
I told the fact that sulfuric acid dissolves the metal.2.
I told the man that sulfuric acid dissolves the metal.3.
I was so tired that I could not move.4.
I was so surprised at the fact that John told us.5.
I told the fact that sulfuric acid dissolves the metal to John.For 1 and 2, the SBC generates seven descriptions as follows,(a) \[s '" \[vp tell \[npthe \[n 1 fact lapp-el that sulfuric ..\]\]\]\]\](l))\[o ... \[vptell \[npthe fact~ \[that ca that sulfuric '..\]l\](c)C..\[vpteU \[npthe fact \[rel_cl\[npthat sulfmic\] ..\]\] \[npthe metallll(d)\[s ""\[vp teu \[np the \[npl fact \[app-cl \[np that sulfuric\] ..\]\]\]\]t(e)\[ \[ tell\[ the fact\] \[ \[ that sulfurm\] \]\]\] s'" vp np ' that-el np ' " ""(0\[.~...\[vptell \[npthe fact \[rel_clthat sulfuric ..\]\]\]\[npthe metal\]\]\]' (g)\[s'"\[vp tell \[np tile fact \[app_clthat sulfuric ..\]\]\[npthe m tal\]\]\](c)- (g) are rated low because they contain less preferred co,,--structions.
\]~klr example, (c) contains tile ommision of a l'elativepronoun, the determiner interpretation f that, a PP-attachmentover a clause (the phrase lhe metal), etc.
As tl,e result, (c) be-.comes tile least preferred one among the interpretations.
(a) and (b) are most prelL>rable for 1 and 2, respectively.
ThePVs of (~;) t~a~d (b) in these sentences differ by the semantic on..dillon that the usage ~to tell *b UtaVcl' prefers human as sb andhy the collocation condition that the noun \[ec~ is often eollo-c~ted with in!
appositional that-clause but the noun man is not.For the sentences 1 and 2, gGW4'p succeeds in integrating suchdifferent soils of preferential cues to give the highest PVs to theinterpretations most preti~rable for till.sna,ii readers, t,'urthermore,because the p~.ths which lead to these interpretations htwe thehighest PV.,; during the whole parsing process, ~my thrrmhold vt~.lues can be used for suspending less pret.~rred interpretations.KCW-.I p t~iso predates the valid interpretation for the sen-tence ~1 in i~ straightforward way, lint it erieounters certain difli-rallies in 4 and 5.At the i;ime when tl, e word ~hat is analyzed iti the sentence4, the tale.tire pronoun interpretation, which leads to the va.lidatia.lysis, h.  a lower PV than the other two interpretaions.
'1;'I~,,.>~dverbiM clause interpretation supported by the word no, andthe ~ppositionM clause interpretation supported |)3' the word \]'aclhave high;~.,: P'V~.
Therefore, if the t!
@shold value is low, thevalid lnteri.~retatum is suspended, l, urthermore> both interprets--lions sucee?d, though they contain siieh a semlmtieally ess pre-ferred struetm'e as \[s lap a?hnl\[vp \[v telll\[n i, Its\]l} arid tile woiileinterpretations are rated low.In the sentence 5, because the interpretation most preferableto human readers contains a PP-attaehment over a clause, it israted less preferable than the one which contMns lap the \[npl.metal  \[pp to Johnll l .The:se ex~i,nrples, pecially the sentence 4, show |.haA, we needa mechanism to notice that the selected parsing pv~ths becomeless feasible (even though they do riot fail) thlm the snspendc<tpaths.
This mechanism reqnires a ~lobal method lot comparingcolnpletely remote PPTs.
We ~dso h~'we to devise a sophisticatedmethod foi deciding the threshold wdue appropriately.'l.

The B f feet  of  D l f fo rml t  Thresho ld  Va lae~7 Coat i  as tor iain this paper, we de~;cribe the organization and the baMc algo-rithm of K(\].W+p.
KGW+p allows one to prepare knowledge for~latural language parsing in two separate forms.
One is for theconMrai'al type of knowledge and the other is for the preferencetype of .knowledge.By nsing the conslraiut type of knowledge, tile Sl-iC (Struc--tme Bnikling Component) in I(GW+p produces partial parsetrees mechanically from left to right in a breadth-llrst real>her.
'Phe scheduler, which is a kind of demo's watching theSBC, loosely controls the whole parsing process by utilizing PVs(Plausibility Values) given by the PRC (Preference Rating Con>ponent).
The PRC uses the preference type of knowledge tocompute the PVs.KGW+p prepares a ti'amework in which we can obtain theflezibiliiy of control, ilte modurarily i~ knowledge preparation ,a.nd lhe efficiency aild completencs.~ of parsing at the same ~ime.I~ is a w.~ry delicate and difficnlt problem to decide the actualPVs of interpretations and the threshohl value for suspendingPPTs.
Because w~rious different sorts of factors may contributeto the PVs with different strengths, we certainly have to coin-brae conventional NLP techniques with appropriate statisticaland stoeha.stie models.
We hope that KGW-I p giw:s us a goodstarting imint for such future researches.\ ]SLe fere~me~\[Ford82\] Ford, M., Bresnan, J., Kaplan, it.
