We.
call this approachlhe Best Otttput Segment (B()S) approach, hi anotherapproach a heuristic "dispatcher" decides which of theavailable engines holds tile highest p,-omise for it giveninput text and then assigns the job to that engine.
This istile DiSlmtcher-Based (DB) approach.
The B()S approachinvolves more processing bill ~lllows an ,.7 posreriori se-lection of the best results.
Tile DB approach saves cyclesbut relies on heuristic ,,., priori selection of the best oulput.hi this latter case, lhe quality of the dispalchermodule iscrucial, but additionally, the DP, approach expecls each c,fthe component engines to be of rather Irish quality, sincethey would not (as is the case in lhe BOS apF, rOach) he"bailed onl" hy olher engines in case of failure.hi what lk-dlows we hrielly describe our lirst experimentwith tile B()S approach and discuss tile requirements fortile DB approach.2.
The  Best  Output  Segment  Appr tmch toAdapt lv i ty()ur B()S Itpproach experiment was cmried out lor a Span-ish - English Iranslation sel-u F, in the fran/ework of IhePangloss MT project (F'angloss, 1994)and used Ihrce.

It was im-portant for tile BOS experiment that this engine genernlcdan internal quality rating for each OUtlmt segment it pro-duced.The tmsic idea of EBMT ix simple (cf.
Nagao, 19g4):an input passage S is comlmred with the sourcc-I:mguage"side" of a bilingual exl archive, where lexl passages areslored witll their Iransllitions ill|() It flu'gel langtmge (or aset of such).
TIle "closesl" matcll, passage S' is selecledand lhe lranslation of lhis clos'ast malch, the passage 7" isaccepled as tile IranslaliOn of S. Our EBMT engine iiscda 100MB bilingual Spmfish - English archive of UN cdti-cial documents, hi preparation fc, r processir~g, die archivewas idigned at tile sentence level.
Tile lnalching of inputpassages with the Spanish side of the archive was allowedto be inexact.
