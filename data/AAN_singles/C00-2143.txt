ln t rodudory  RemarksThe present paper describes a project aimed atdeveloping the first annotated corpus of P, ussiantexts.
I.arge text coq~ora trove been used in thecomputational linguistics community longenough: at present, over 20 large corpora for themain European languages arc available, thelargest of them containing hundreds of millions ofwords (I.anguage Resources (19971); Marcus,Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz (1993); Kurohashi,Nagao (1998)).
So far, however, no annotatedcorpora for Russian have been developed.
To thebest of our knowledge, the present project is thefirst attempt to fill the gap.l)ifferent tasks require different annotation levelsthat entail different amount of additionalinformation about text structure.
The corpus thatis; being created in the fiamework of the pre.sentproject consists of several subcorpora that differby the level of annotation.
The following threelevels are envisaged:?
lemmalized leA'Is, for every word, its normalform (lemma) and part of speech areindicated;?
mowhologically tagged leXlS: for every word,a full set of nlorl)hological attributes itspecified along with the lenmm and the part ofspeech;?
symactically tagged ldxlx: apart from tile fullmorphological markup at the word level,every sentence has a syntax structure.We annotate Russian texts with depmlde,wystructttres - a formalism that is more suitable forSlavonic languages with their relatively fiee wordorder.
The structure not only contains inl'omlationon which words of the sentence are syntacticallylinked, but also relegates each link to one of theseveral dozen syntactic types (at present, we use78 syntactic relations).
This formalism ensures amore complete and informative representationthan ally other syntactically annotated corpus.This is a major innowttion, since the majority ofsyntactically annotated corpora, both thosealready awfilable and under construction,represent he syntactic structure by means ofconstituents.The closest analogue to our work is the Czechannotated corpus collected at Charles Universityin Prague - see I tajicova, Panevova, Sgall (19981).In this corpus, the syntactic data are alsoexpressed in a dependency formalism, althoughthe set of syntactic functional relations is muchsmaller as it only has 23 relationsIn what follows, we describe the types of textsused to create the coqms (Section 2), markupformat (Section 3), annotation tools andprocedures (Sectional), and types of linguisticdata included in the markup (Section 5).2.
Source text selectionThe well-known Uppsala University Corpus ofcontemporary Russian prose, totalling ca.1,000,000 words, has been chosen as the prilnarysource for our work.
The Uppsaht Corpus is wellbalanced between fiction and journalistic genre,with a smaller percentage of scientific and popularscience texts.
The Corpus includes samples ofcontemporary Russian prose, as well as excerptsflom newspapers and magazines of recentdecades, and gives a representative coverage of987written Russian in modern use.
Conversationalexamples are scarce and appear as dialoguesinside fiction texts.3.
Markup flDrnmtThe design principles were fommlated as follows:?
"layered" markup-  several annotation levelscoexist and can be extracted or processedindependently;?
incrementality - it should be easy to addhigher annotation levels;?
convenient parsing of the annotated text bymeans of standard software packages.The most natural solution to meet this criteria isan XML-based markup language.
We have triedto make our format compatible with TEI (TextEncoding for Interchange, see TEI Guidelines(1994)), inuoducing new elements or attributesonly in situations where TEI markup does notprovide adequate means to describe the textstructure in the dependency grammar framework.Listed below are types of iuformation about textstructure tlmt must be encoded in the markup, andrelative tags/attributes u ed to bear them.a) Splitting of text into sentences.
A specialcontainer element <S> (available in TEI) is usedto delimit sentence boundaries.
The element mayhave an (optional) ID attribute that supplies aunique identifier for the sentence within the text;this identifier may be used to store infommtionabout extra-sentential relations in the text.
It mayalso have a COMMENT attribute, used by linguiststo store observations about particular syntacticphenomena encountered in the sentence;b) Splitting of sentences into lexical items~ .
The words are delimited by a containerelement <W>.
Like sentences, words may have aunique "rD attribute that is used to reference theword within the sentence;c) Ascribing morphological features to words.Morphological information is ascribed to the wordby means of two attributes born by the <W> tag:LlgNNg_- a normalized word form;FEAT - morphological features.d) Storing information about the syntax structure.To annotate the information about syntacticdependencies, we use two other attributes in the<W> element:DON- the ID of the master word;LINK - syntactic function label.There are also special provisions in the lbrmalismto store auxiliary information, e.g.
multiplemorphological nalyses and syntax trees.
They areexpected to disappear from the final version of thecorpus.4.
Annotat ion tools and proceduresThe procedure of corpus data acquisition is senti-automatic.
An initial version of markup isgenerated by a computer using a general ~urposemorphological analyzer and syntax parser engine;after that, the results of the automatic processingare submitted to human post-editing.
The analysisengine (morphology and parsing) is based uponthe ETAP-3 machine translation engine - seeApresjan et al (1992, 1993).To support he creation of mmotated ata, a set oftools was designed and implemented.
All tools areWin32 applications written in C++.
The toolsavailable are:?
a program for sentence boundaries markup,called Chopper;" a post-editor for building, editing and mana-ging syntactically annotated texts - SlruclureEdilor (or SirEd).The amount of manual work required to buildannotations depends on the complexity of theinput data.
SirEd offers different options forbuilding structures.
Most sentences can be reliablyprocessed without any human intervention; in thiscase, a linguist should look through the processingresult and confirm it.
If the structure containserrors, the linguist can edit it using a user-friendlygraphical interface (see screenshots below).
If theerrors are too many or no structure could beproduced, the linguist may use a special split-and-rtm mode.
This mode includes manual pre-chunking of the input phrase into pieces with amore transparent structure and applying theanalyzer/parser to every chunk.
Then the linguistmust manually link the subtrees produced forevery chunk into a single structure.If the linguist has encountered a very peculiarsyntactic onstruction so that he/she is uncertain988glbOtil the ton'cot strticture, he/she lllay mark its"doubtful"  the whole sentence or sirlgh.

Types of linguistic information by levelM o rpK0Jg_g y informationThe morphological analyzer ascribes features toevery word.
The feature set for Russian includes:part of speech, animateness, gender, number,case, degree of comparison, short form (ofadjectives and participles), representation (ofverbs), aspect, tense, person, voice.Syntax informationAs we have already mentioned, the result of theparsing is a tree composed of links.
Links arebinary and oriented; they link single words ratherthan syntactic groups.
For every syntactic group,one word (head) is chosen to represent it as aslave in larger syntactic units; all other membersof the group become slaves of the head.In a typical case, the number of nodes in thesyntactic tree corresponds to the number of wordtokens.
However, several exceptional situationsoccur in which the number of nodes may be lessor even greater than the number of word tokens.The latter case is especially interesting.
Wepostulate such a description in the followingcases:a) Copulative sentences in the present tensewhere the auxiliary verb can be omitted.
Thisis treated as a special "zero-form" of thecopula, e.g.
On - uchitel' \[He is a teacher, lit.He - teacher\]?
The copula should beintroduced in the syntactic representation.b) Elliptical constructs (omitted members ofcontrasted coordinative xpressions), like inJa kupil rubashku, a on galstuk \[I bought ashirt, and he bought a necktie, lit.
I bought ashirt, and he a necktie\].The latter type of sentences should be discussed inmore detail.
Elliptical constructions are known tobe one of the toughest problems in theformalization of natural language syntax.
In ourcorpus, we decided to reconstruct he omittedelements in the syntactic trees, tamking them witha special '?phantom" feature.
In the aboveexample, a phantom node is inserted into thesentence between the words on 'he' and galstuk'necktie'.
This new node will have a lemmaPOKUPAT" \[BUY\] and will beat" exactly the samemorphological features as the wordform kupil\[bought\] physically present in the sentence, plus aspecial "phantom" marker.
In certain cases, thefeature set for the phantom may differ from that ofthe prototype, e.g.
in a slightly modified phrase Jakupil rubashku, aona  galstuk \[I bought a shirt,and she (bought) a necktie\] the phantom node willhave the feminine gender, as required by theagreement with the subject of the second clause.Most real-life elliptical constructs can berepresented in this way.The inventory of syntactic relationship typesgenerated by the ETAP--3 system is wLst enough:at present, we count 78 different syntacticfunction types.
All relationships are divided into 6990major groups: aclant, altribulive, quantitative,adverbial, coordinative, auxiliary.For readers' COlwenience, we will give equivalentEnglish examples:Aelant relalionships link the predicate word toits arguments.
Some examples (\[IX\] - master,\[Y\] - slave):predicative - Pete \[Y\] reads \[X\];completive (1,2, 3 ) -  translate \[X\]the book \[Y, l-compl\]from \[Y1, 2-compl\] Englishinto \[Y2, 3-compl\] RussianAh-ibutive relationships often link a noun to amodifier expressed by an adjectve, another noun,a participle clause, etc:relative- The house \[X\] we live\[YI in.Quanlitalive relationships link a noun to a wordwith quantity semantics, or two such words one toanother:quantitative - f ive \[Y\] pages \[IX\];auxiliary-quantitative - gtirly \[Y\] five IX\];Adverbial relationshil)s link the predicate word tovarious adverbial modifiers:adverbial- come \[Xl i ,  the evening \[Y\];parenthetic - In my opinion IYI, lhal's \[IX\] righI.Coordinalive relationships serve for clausescoordinated by conjunctions:coordinative - buy apples \[XI and peaJwlYl ;coordinative-conj unctive - I)tty applesand \[X\] l)emw \[Y\].Auxiliary relationships typically link twoelements that form a single syntactic unit:analytical- will \[IX\] buy \[Y\];The list of syntactic relations is not closed.
Tileprocess of data acquisition brings up a variety ofrare syntactic constructions, hardly covered bytraditional grammars.
In some cases, this has ledto the introduction of new syntactic link types inorder to reflect the semantic relation betweensingle words and make tile syntactic structureunambiguous.Conclus ionCorpus crcation is not yet complctcd: at prcscnt,the flfll syntactic markup has been generated for4,000 sentences (55,000 words), which constitutes30% of the total amount planned.
Our approachpermits to include all information expressed bymorphological and syntactic means incontemporary Russian.
We expect that the newcorpus will stimulate a broad range of furtherinvestigations, both theoretical and applied.We plan to make the corpus awtilable via EI,RAfiamework after completion.
