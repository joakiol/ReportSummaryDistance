NIST-DARPA Interagency Agreement"SLS ProgramDavid S. PallettNational Institute of Standards and TechnologyBuilding 225, Room A-216Galthersburg, MD 20899dave@ ssi.ncsl.nist.govObjectives:\[1\] To provide a central role in the design, develop-ment and dis~bution of speech corpora.\[2\] To design, coordinate implementation of, andanalyze results of performance assessment testsfor DARPA's Spoken Language Systems.\[4\] Coordinate Performance Evaluation WorkingGroup activities for DARPA Spoken LanguageSystems and analyze the results of the June 1990SLS tests.\[5\] Design improved test procedures and administeradditional Resource Management and ATISdomain tests prior to the February 1991 meeting.Recent Accomplishments:\[1\] Prepared the CD-ROM versions of the ResourceManagement (PSI )  and Extended ResourceManagement (RM2) Corpora (a total of six discs)for use within the DARPA speech research com-munity and for public distribution through theNational Technical Information Service (NTIS).These discs include the scoring software and sta-tistical significance tools for benchmark perfor-mance assessment tests.\[2\] Developed additional performance analysis toolsand applied these to all Resource Managementbenchmark test results reported to NIST sinceMarch 1987.\[3\] Coordinated Performance Evaluation WorkingGroup activities for the DARPA Air Travel Infor-marion System (ATIS) common task, and admin-istered the first multi-site performance assessmenttest in this domain.Plans:\[1\] Prepare the complete TIMIT corpus for release inCD-ROM.\[2\] Prepare the complete Pilot ATIS Corpus forrelease in CD-ROM.\[3\] Collaborate with others (e.g., CMU,  and ((possi-bly)) NYNEX and IBM) in preparing otherspeech corpora for release in CD-ROM fonnat.419
