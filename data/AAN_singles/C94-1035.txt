In this model, morpholovicalanalysis is considered as a process ofcandidate Generation and candidate selection.In order to increase tile performance of thesystem, the number of candidates is highlyreduced and tim system require.s smallnumber of d ic t ionary  accesses.
Idiosynchraticfeatures of a syllable, formalized as acharacteristic fnnetion, make it possible toreject implausible candklates before dictionaryconfirmation, instead of a letter, syllable is abasic processing unit for the practicalimplementation of the morphological analyzer.1.
Introduct ionThere are two linguistic phenomena thatare interested in Ihe processing ofcomputational morphology.
They aremorphological transformation and morphemeidentification.
Two- leve l  model andsyllable--based formalism focussed on theproblem of morl)hological h'ansformntionIBear88, Cahig0, Kosk83\].
Morphemeidentification is an importmlt issue in somelanguages where two or more morphemes avecombined to make a word, a compound word,or a sentence without any delimiters betweenmorphemes \[Abe86, Chen92, Paeh92\].The goal of morphological analysis is tofind the base form of morphemes in a word.It consists of a generation of analysiscandidates and the selection of ton'cotcandidates.
Analysis candidates are generatedas a reverse process of word formation rules'.morpheme isolation and morphologicaltransformation.
Then, correct candidates areselected by the coherence restrictions amongYung Taek KiInDept.

The  l ) rob lemTwo.-level model is widely known to be neomputationnlly efficient method for thepractical system on the condition thai themunber of rules is smnll\[Bart86, Kosk88\].Howew.w, when the size of the rulebase islarge it causes an exponential probleln.
Incase of the Korean langttage, it is commonthat a stenl is succeeded by I,,rammaticaln~orphemes.
If we use the twe- level  modelfor a practical sys/eln, a small set ofphonological rules and a large set ofrnorl)helne isolation rules are required becausethere are several thousand colnbinalion.~ ofgrammatical morphemes\[Zhan90\].in order to solve the problem, we can trya 2--pass algorithm.
All the l)OS,~iblemorl)hemes are isolated, and then do aphonological processing.
It is also l~ossil)le todo a phonological processing first andmorphemes are isolated at the second Imss.\[iowever, this Mad of solution causes m~olllerSelious problem that o(;eut+s l'totll theconditional resh'ie{ions: (1) ,,:ememorphologieal transformation occurs not onlyat a stem but also at a functional inorpheme,(2) there are eooccurrenee restrictionsbetween two morl)hemes, (3) morphologicaltl'ansfovlnat\[oll OCCtll'S only for the El)e.cinlword grotlp.3.
Sy l lab le -based  wr i t ing  sys temThe writ ina system for most languaffes i,~;based on t i le letter  set cal led as alphabet.Instead of' a letter  se, t, Chinese wr i t ing221system is based on the set of characters thatconsists of one or more letters.
Eachcharacter is a meaning unit and words arerepresented by the combination of characters.In case of Korean, words are represented byone or more characters as in Chinese.
Thedifference is that Korean character is awell-formed written syllable, which is asound unit rather than a meaning unit as inChinese.
A written syllable is a combinationof two or three sound symbols, whichcorresponds to a spoken syllable in aone-to-one fashion\[Chun90\].
Korean wordsare constructed as follows based on thesyllable unit.word ::= { syllable )"syllable ::= open_syll I closed syllopen_syll ::= initial + medialclosed_syll ::= initial + medial + final4.
Id iosynehrat i c  features  of sy l lab leThere are 11,172 syllables in the modernKorean language( = 19 initials * 21 medials *27 finals plus one for null).
However, it isi,)teresting to investigate the usage ofsyllables to make a word.
About 2,350syllables cover more than 99.9% of themodern Korean words.
Furthermore, 267syllables(11.36% of 2,350 syllables) are onlyused for the surface form of verbs, andgrammatical morphemes are combinations of151 syllables(6.43% of 2,350 syllables).
Inaddition, only a very small set of syllables, 1to 46 syllables for each type of irregularverbs, are tied to the morphologicaltransformation \[Kang93\].
This ldnct ofinformation is very useful to improve Iheefficiency of the morphological mmlyzer.
Forexample, if a syllable used only for thesurface form of verb is found in a word, wecan easily guess that the word is a verb, thestring before that syllable is a stem, and therest is a grammatical morpheme.
There is noother chance for the different result excepttypographic errors.Suppose that X is a set of syllables thatare used at the first position of grammaticalmorphemes.
We can easily guess the syllableboundary position of grammatical morphemein an n-syl lable word at syllable .v~, where xjX and i :~ j K n. There is no thepossibility at other positions.
It is based onthe fact that only 48 syllables are used forthe first position of postl)ositions and 72syllables for the first position of final endingsin the Korean language.Three Idnds of syllable features aredefined from where the features are extracted.
'Unit feature' is a syllable featm'e defined onthe syllable itself.
If a syllable xi itself has anidiosynchratic feature J\], then xi has a unitfeature g. 'Partial feature' is defined by thecomponent of a syllable.
A syllable xi iscalled to have a pm'tial feature 1)~, if xiincludes a component 1)~, as an initial, amedial, or a final letter.
'Successive featlwe'is a mete-level feature defined for theadjacent wo syllable features.
For example, ifthere is a set of two successive syllablesxixi,l that construct grammatical morphemesand that cannot construct any noun/verb,then the boundary position of a grammatk.
'almorpheme is possible only at syllable xi orXi~ 1.5.
Character i s t i c  funct ionIdiosynchratie features of syllables arerepresented using a characteristic set ofsyllables.
Suppose that a part of speech(i),morpheme length(j), and the position ofsyllable in a word(k) are discriminatingfeatures of a characteristic set.

ALTERNATIONIDICTIONARY ACCESSanalysis resultFig.
morphological analysisOverall view of the morphological analyzeris shown in the figure.
The first step is tofind the morpheme boundaries usingcharacteristic function for syllables.
Stemcandidates are generated at the second stepby the phonological rules.
Phonological rulesare only applied at a syllable w\[i\] if and onlyif w\[i-1\] is an element of a requiredcharacteristic set, and w\[i+l\] is the beginningsyllable of other morpheme.Following algorithm is to guess thebeginning position of gralnmatical morpheme.In the algorithm, GM_SET1 and GM_SET2are characteristic sets for the fi,'st and therest syllables of grammatical morphemes,respectively.algorithm boundary_syllable(word)syllable word\[\]; /* input word */beginn : nsyl(word);for (i : 1; i < n; i = i+D (if (word\[i\] E GM_SET1) (if (word\[i+1\] ~ GM_SF.T2)return(i);))return(n);endAlgorithm.
morpheme boundary7.
Eva luat ion  of  the mode lThere are two types of candidates for aword.
The first type is generated by themorpheme isolation at all the syllableboundary and tile second type is generatedfor each morpheme candidate by thephonological rules.
We can count the numberof candidates as follows.
Suppose that a bethe maximum number of syllables that causesan inflexion, /3 be the candidates for prefinalendings, and ?"
be the maximum number ofinflexions for one syllable, in case of Korean,ct is less than n, 13 is 2, and ~' is 3.
If a wordconsists of n syllables, then lhe maximumnumber of canclidates is 10n+8a+2.- candidates for 1-morpheme wordand (notm+postposition)2240) 1 -morpheme word: 1@ noun + postposition: n-1@ noun + suffix + poslposition: n-2- candidates for irregular verbs and( verb + ending)@ verb + ending: n - l+a(D verb + prefinal_ending + ending: /3(6) verb infiexion: ?

Only plausiblecandidates are generated using theidiosynehratie features of syllable.
Now,maximum number of candidates is connted asa constant and tile number of dictionaryaccesses is highly reduced.O@@@@@?1-inorpheme word: 1noun + postposition: 2nOtlllverbverbverbverb+ suffix + postposition: 2+ ending: 2+ prefinal_ending + ending: 2/~inflexion: ?,(2+2/~)'" suffix ~ ending: (2~28),2"(2~2/3)C(n)  - O ~ @ + @ + (,1) + (9 + (6) , (7;= 2fl + 42" + 4/D' t- 9The previous algorithm has O(n) complexitybecause it tries to isolate function word at allthe syllable positions.
However, if syllablefeatures are used then the worst--timecomplexity of the Korean morphologicalanalysis beeoines a constant.
In this case, weshould use lhe fact that there is no stem thatincludes two successive syllables 'xy'  suchthat 'xy'  is a substring of grammaticaImorpheme.8.
Conc lus ionSyllable-based formalism is proposed tosolve the problem of morphological alternationwith morpheme isolation where manycandidates are generated by tile phonologicalrules.
It improved the worst--time complexityO(n)  to a constant ,  and  tim nulnber ofdictionary accesses is highly reduced usingtile syllable features that are extracted froinwords and formalized to be available for amorphological analyzer.
They are very useftflfor the isolation of morphemes, which make itpossible to guess the boundary position of astem without accessing the dictionary.
Theyare also useful to reject the implausible baseforms from a w~rb.Charaeterislic set of syllables andsyllable-lmsed formalism may be applied forlhe languages whose words consists ofsyllables and morphological operation isdescribed as a syllable- to-syllabletransformation to increase tile performance oftile morphological analyzer.
In addition,idiosynchratic features of syllable may beused for the analysis and recognition ofimturnl languago.s such as spelling check,phonological representation of words, andcharacter ecognition.Korean morphological analyzer wasimplemented at IBM-PC 486 tlsing Clanguage.
