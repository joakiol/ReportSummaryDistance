We present a computational model (in ACT-R, Anderson, 2007) to explain how referring subjects are used and interpreted.
We furthermore report on an experiment that tests predictions that follow from simulations.
The results of the experiment support the model predictions that WM load only affects the interpretation of pronouns in stories with a topic shift, but not in stories without a topic shift.
1 Introduction How do listeners interpret a potentially ambiguous referring expression?
To describe a particular event, object or character, often different referring expressions can be used.
Some referring expres-sions are more specific than others.
For example, a proper name such as ?Eric?
is more specific than the personal pronoun ?he?, which can refer to any of the male characters in a given linguistic context.
Generally, pronouns are used and interpreted as referring to the most salient character or object (the topic) in the linguistic context (a.o., Ariel, 1990; Gundel, Hedberg, & Zacharski, 1993).
In contrast, full noun phrases or proper names are used to introduce new characters or to refer to less salient characters.
Different factors have been found to affect the saliency of characters or ob-jects in the linguistic context (see Arnold, 1998, for a review), among others the grammatical role.
The subject of the previous sentence is likely to be the current topic (Grosz, Weinstein, & Joshi, 1995).
As a result, listeners will often interpret a pronoun as referring to the previous subject (a.o., McDonald & MacWhinney, 1995; Stevenson, Crawley, & Kleinman, 1994).However, for children up to the age of 7, the grammatical role seems to be a less important cue than for adults.
Manipulating the discourse struc-ture, Koster and colleagues showed that children interpret subject pronouns in a different way than adults do (Koster, Hoeks, & Hendriks, in press).
They presented adults and children with prere-corded short stories about two characters of the same gender.
Two types of stories were tested, stories with and without a topic shift.
In the stories with topic shift the topic shifted halfway by changing the grammatical role of the characters (see Table 1): the second character becomes the subject of next sentences, rather than the first character.
In all stories the final sentence started with a potentially ambiguous pronoun (?he?
or ?she?).

Table 1: Example of the Dutch sentences (and the Eng-lish translations) of a story with and without topic shift.67Adult listeners interpreted this pronoun as refer-ring to the second character in stories with a topic shift, and as referring to the first character in sto-ries without a topic shift.
Children, on the other hand, did not distinguish between these two types of stories: they showed a small preference for the first character as the referent of the pronoun.
Kos-ter et al found that children with a higher auditory working memory capacity performed more adult-like, which raises the question whether limited WM capacity causes decreased performance.
We have implemented a cognitive model to in-vestigate the effect of WM load on the interpreta-tion of subject pronouns in discourse.
To test the prediction following from our model that WM load can decrease adults?
comprehension of stories with a topic shift, we also performed an experi-ment.
2 Modeling pronoun interpretation We have implemented a cognitive model within the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson, 2007) that can simulate both the use and interpre-tation of referring subjects (Van Rij, Van Rijn, & Hendriks, submitted).
Here we focus on the inter-pretation of subject pronouns.
2.1 Computational simulation To simulate the results of Koster et al (in press), the model is presented with stories of 6 sentences, with or without a topic shift.
The stories are pro-vided to the model word by word.
During on-line sentence processing the model builds a (simpli-fied) representation of the preceding discourse: every character in the story is represented in the declarative memory.
Each representation (referred to as ?chunk?)
has a certain amount of activation that reflects the saliency of the character in the current discourse.
The model determines the refer-ent of the potentially ambiguous pronoun in the final sentence, by selecting the chunk with the highest level of activation as the current discourse topic and as the referent of the pronoun.
Explaining children?s and adults?
performance In ACT-R, the activation of chunks reflects the chunk?s history, because activation is dependent on the frequency of use (the more frequently used, the higher the activation) and the recency of the last retrieval (the more recent the last retrieval, thehigher the activation).
The activation of chunks decays with time, but is increased when the chunk is retrieved.
In addition to this base-level activa-tion, spreading activation can temporarily boost the activation of a chunk in a particular context, reflecting the usefulness of that chunk in that con-text1.
Chunks that are currently being processed spread activation to other, connected chunks in declarative memory.
As the amount of spreading activation determines the ability to maintain goal-relevant information, differences in spreading ac-tivation account for individual differences in working memory capacity (Daily, Lovett, & Reder, 2001).
In our model, the subject of the pre-vious sentence spreads activation to all discourse elements associated with it.
To explain the difference between children?s and adults?
interpretation of subject pronouns, we manipulated the amount of spreading-activation from the previous subject.
If the amount of spread-ing activation is high, the chunk representing the subject spreads a large amount of activation and discourse elements that are associated with the subject become more activated in comparison with the other discourse elements.
As a result, the model will retrieve the subject of the previous sen-tence as the current discourse topic.
However, if the subject spreads a small amount of activation, reflecting a low WM capacity, then there will be no effect on the discourse elements associated with the subject.
In that case, the effects of fre-quency and recency will be the main determinants of which referent is retrieved.
Figure 1 shows the effect of WM capacity (i.e., the amount of spreading activation) on the activa-tion of the two referents in the stories that were provided to the model.
The second character, ref-erent ?b?, is introduced in the third sentence.
The +TS condition starts to differ from the ?
TS condi-tion in sentence 4, where the second character be-                                                           1  In ACT-R the activation of chunk i is defined by:, with n being thenumber of presentations of chunk i, and tk the time since the kth presentation, m the number of chunks that are connected with chunk i, Wj the amount of activation that is spread from chunk j, Sji the strength of association between j and i, and ?i  noise.
The activation of a chunk determines the time it takes to re-trieve it from declarative memory:?T = e?Ai .68comes the subject in the +TS stories but not the ?TS stories (cf.
Koster et al, in press).
With a high WM capacity, the model selects the subject of the previous sentence as the referent of the pronoun in sentence 6, because this discourse element clearly has the highest activation (Figure 1, right).
How-ever, with a low WM capacity, the model will show a much-reduced preference for the second character as the referent of the pronoun, and often chooses the first character.
Similarly to children?s performance, the models?
interpretation of pro-nouns is not affected by grammatical role (Figure 1, left).Figure 1.
Mean levels of activation of the first charac-ter (a) and the second character (b) in stories with (+TS) and without (-TS) a topic shift, measured at the end of each of 5 sentences (x-axis).
In sentence 6, the model selects the character with the highest activation as the referent of the pronoun.
Prediction of the model On the basis of these simulations we propose that an individual?s WM capacity determines how much the grammatical structure of the previous sentence plays a role in resolving a potentially ambiguous subject pronoun.
If this hypothesis is correct, we expect that adults show difficulties in detecting a topic shift when their WM is taxed by having to perform a memory task in parallel.
This prediction follows directly from the ACT-R model: goal-relevant information spreads a pro-portion of the total spreading activation to other chunks in the declarative memory.
If the number of sources from which activation is spread in-creases, the amount of spreading activation that is received by individual chunks decreases.
In a highWM load situation, more information needs to be maintained in an activated state and as a result, the subject of the previous sentence spreads less acti-vation to the discourse elements associated with the subject.
Therefore, the model predicts that adult listeners or readers show more child-like per-formance in high WM load conditions: they will more often select the first character as the current discourse topic.
In addition, the model predicts that it will take more time to retrieve a discourse element in a high WM load condition, because the retrieval time is determined by the level of activa-tion (the lower the activation, the longer it takes to retrieve the information).
3 Experiment We performed a dual-task experiment to test our prediction that adult listeners will show difficulties with the comprehension of a topic shift if they have less WM capacity available.
To manipulate WM load, participants were asked to perform a combined task: memorizing a sequence of digits for later recall and performing a moving-window task (Just, Carpenter, & Woolley, 1982).
3.1 Methods Digit task At the start of each trial, participants were pre-sented with a sequence of either three or six digits (low and high WM load conditions) that they had to memorize.
Digits were shown for 1 second each in the center of a computer screen.
After complet-ing the moving-window task, the participants re-called the memorized digits.
The digits were pseudo-randomly chosen from 1 to 9, while ensur-ing that not all the digits were the same.
Moving-window task After the presentation of the digits, the moving-window task started.
In this task, participants had to read stories of four sentences each (see Table 1), followed by a comprehension question.
The sentences were presented one by one and were subdivided into smaller word clusters (indicated by dashes in Table 1).
Using a typical moving-window paradigm (Just et al, 1982), only the let-ters of one single word cluster were visible at a time.
All other letters were replaced by a dot.
By pressing a button, the participant could move the69window to the next word cluster.
After reading the four-sentence story in this way, a question was presented in the center of the screen, and two an-swer alternatives were presented in the bottom corners of the screen.
Participants had to press the corresponding button to answer the question.
After answering the question, they had to type in the digits that were presented at the beginning of the trial.
At the end of each trial, participants only re-ceived feedback on the digit task to ensure suffi-cient focus on the WM task.
We collected different measures per trial: the reading times per region, accuracy and reaction times for the ques-tions and the number of errors in reproducing the digits.
Design  Stories.
In every story two characters of the same gender played a role, of which the first names started with a different letter.
All names consisted of 4-8 characters, and two syllables.
Importantly, the final sentence started with a subject pronoun hij (?he?)
or zij (?she?)
that was ambiguous: the pronoun could refer to both characters, so that the only clue to the interpretation of the pronouns was the structure of the story.
We designed two variants of every test story (see Table 1), in which we manipulated whether there was a shift of topic.
The topic shift is real-ized by making the second character (?Philip?)
the subject of the second sentence.
If there was no topic shift, we expected participants to prefer the firstly introduced character as the referent of the ambiguous pronoun, but if there was a topic shift, we expected participants to prefer the second char-acter.
At the end of every test story a question was presented to elicit the preferred interpretation of the ambiguous pronoun.
Lists.
The presented materials were part of a larger experiment, in which we additionally tested another two variants of every story.
In total, 64 test stories were designed in four different vari-ants.
Four lists of 64 test stories were constructed, so that every list received a different variant of the test stories and thus contained 16 test stories per condition.
Besides the test stories, the lists also contained 128 filler items (the same for all lists), so that the lists consisted of 192 items in total.
The filler stories had the same structure as the test sto-ries, so 64 filler stories per condition.
The fillerstories were followed by a question about the first or second sentence of the story to avoid reading strategies and to mask the experimental manipula-tions.
Half of the filler questions asked about one of the characters, the other half asked about a non-referent (what- or where-question).
Note that in contrast to the test questions, that were designed to elicit an interpretational preference, filler ques-tions were not ambiguous and could be unambigu-ously scored as right or wrong.
Here, we report on 2 times 32 test items, and the 64 filler items with the same two discourse structures.
One test story (both variants) was re-moved from the data, because of a technical prob-lem during presentation.
Procedure Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four lists.
The experiment consisted of two blocks: a low WM load block (3 digits) and a high WM load block (6 digits).
The order of blocks was counterbalanced; within blocks the items were randomly distributed.
Participants first received instructions, followed by a practice trial suited for the current WM load condition.
Between the two blocks participants received instructions for the other digit task.
Participants Sixty-two first-year psychology students (17 men, 40 women; mean age 20) participated in the ex-periment in exchange for course credits.
Five participants could not complete the experiment because of technical problems.
Another 5 partici-pants were excluded from data analysis, because they answered less than 75% of the filler questions correctly in the low WM load condition, and/or performed at chance level in one of the two types of filler questions.
Data of 52 participants (15 men, 37 women) was used for the statistical analy-ses.
3.2 Results In this section we first discuss the performance on the digit tasks, followed by the off-line story com-prehension results, i.e., answers on the questions and the related reaction times, and the self-paced reading data.70Digit task results Participants made more errors on the digit-task in the high WM load condition than in the low WM load condition (percentage correct trials: 3-digits=77.2%, 6-digits=52.0%, mean errors per trial: 3-digits=0.343, 6-digits=0.852), indicating that the 6-digit condition was indeed more diffi-cult.
We did not find any effect of story condition on the number of errors in the digit task or on the percentages correct trials.
Off-line results Answers.
Figure 2 shows the preference for either the first or second character as the referent of the ambiguous pronoun at the end of the test stories.Figure 2: Referent preference for stories without (-TS) and with (+TS) topic shift (?
SE), plotted separately for both WM load conditions.
Figure 2 shows that participants were sensitive to the topic-shift manipulation.
In both WM load conditions, the expected referent was preferred (i.e., Referent 1 in ?TS, and Referent 2 in +TS).
We examined the effects of Topic shift, WM load, and Trial position, the position of the trial in the experiment, on the choice for the first charac-ter (yes or no) using logistic mixed-effects models (cf.
Baayen, 2008).
More complex models that included additional predictors did not show quali-tatively different effects.
In all the presented mod-els, participant and item (i.e., all variants of a story were labeled as the same item) were included as crossed-random effects.
We compared different models using a step-wise variable deletion procedure, starting with the complete interaction model.
For every model comparison, we examined whether the difference in -2 log likelihood is significant, given the differ-ence in degrees of freedom using the chi-square distribution.
If this difference is significant, thereduced model has a significantly lower goodness-of-fit, indicating that the deletion of the variable or interaction is not justified.
As removing the 3-way interaction did not show a significant difference with the complete interaction model, we selected the model without this three-way interaction as the baseline (or full model).
Figure 3 summarizes the model comparisons performed to investigate whether WM load and the type of story affect the choice for the first character (left graph).
All two-way interactions (Topic shift by Trial position, Trial position by WM load, and importantly Topic shift by WM load) needed to be included in the statistical model.Figure 3.

The statistical significance is calculated with a ?2-test (with 1,1,1, or 3 degrees of freedom respectively).
(?*?
p<.05, ?**?
p<.01, ?***?
p<.001)  The best model showed that, in stories with topic shift (+TS), the first character was selected more often in the high WM load condition than in the low WM load condition (?=0.844, z=3.57; p<.001), in line with the assumption that decreas-ing working memory capacity reduces pronoun resolution performance.
The model showed no general effect of WM load (?=0.308, z=1.10; p>.1).
Thus, no differential effect for WM load condition was found for the condition without top-ic shift.
In addition, participants were more likely to select the first character in stories with a topic shift as the experiment progressed (?=0.008, z=3.81; p<.001), but in the high WM load condi-tion this effect was reduced (?=-0.005, z=-2.28; p=.023).
Reaction times.
In the same way as we ana-lyzed the choice of referent, we analyzed the log-transformed reaction times after excluding the short outliers (<= 50ms; less than 1% of the data).
However, we did not find any significant interac-tion (see Figure 3).
The best fitting model, which71included the main effects, but no interactions, only showed a significant contribution of Trial posi-tion: Participants became faster in answering dur-ing the experiment (?=-0.002, t=-5.97; p<.001).
To summarize, we found that WM load affects the comprehension of stories with a topic shift, but not the stories without a topic shift: participants more often select the first character as the referent of the ambiguous pronoun in the high WM load condition.
However, we did not find a difference in reaction times between the two types of stories, suggesting that the questions after stories with a topic shift are not more difficult to answer.
These findings support our prediction that adults will show difficulties in processing a topic shift if they experience more WM load.
3.3 Reading time data Before analyzing the reading time data we re-moved missing data (2%), short outliers (smaller than 50 ms, 19%) and used a log-transform to re-duce the effect of the long outliers (cf.
Baayen & Milin, 2010).
The relatively large amount of short outliers was caused by a technical problem.
As the outliers were equally distributed over the story conditions and the WM load conditions (?2(1)=0.925, p>.1), it is unlikely that this influ-ences our results in qualitative ways.
We compared linear mixed-effects models in the same way as before to test the effects of Topic shift, WM load, and Trial position for all moving-window regions on the log-transformed reading times.
More complex models that included addi-tional predictors did not show qualitatively differ-ent effects.
We found no significant 3-way or 2-way interactions in the analyzed regions that needed to be included in the statistical model.
We therefore only report on the main-effects model.
Sentence 1.
The first sentence of the story is identical in both variants of the stories (-TS and +TS).
Figure 4 displays reading times of the first three regions for the two working memory condi-tions, collapsed over the two story types.
The main-effects model showed an effect of Trial posi-tion (participants read faster as the experiment progressed, ?=-0.004, t=-13.00; p<.001), an effect of WM load (increased reading time in high WM condition, ?=0.245, t=9.44; p<.001), but no effect of Topic shift (?=0.012, t=0.48; p>.1).
Similar re-sults were found for region 2.Figure 4.
Reading times (raw data) of the first three regions of sentence 1 (?SE).
(English translation of an example sentence from Table 1)  Sentence 2.
In the stories with a topic shift (+TS), the topic shift is initiated in the second sen-tence, by introducing a new character in subject position.
Therefore, we would expect to see differ-ences in reading times between the two story types.
In addition, we expected to find an interac-tion between WM load and Topic shift, as an early measure of the effect of WM load on the off-line data: in the high WM load condition, the previous subject has less influence, therefore we would ex-pect the difference in reading times to be reduced.
However, we did not find any significant interac-tion.
Figure 5 shows the normalized effects of re-gions 1-4 of the second sentence (normalized by the first region).
For region 1, the main effects model revealed that participants became faster over the course of the experiment (?=-0.004, t=-12.21; p<.001).
However, Topic shift (?=0.024, t=0.83; p>.1) and WM load (?=-0.010, t=-0.33; p>.1) did not contribute to the fit of the data.Figure 5.
Normalized reading times (difference with region 1) of the first four regions of sentence 2 (?SE).
(English translations of example sentences from Table 1)72For analyzing the reading times of region 2 we removed possible confounding effects at the be-ginning of the sentence, such as the effect of Trial position, by taking the difference in reading time between the second and first region.2 The main-effects model for analyzing region 2 without Trial position showed a significant increase in reading time for the stories with a topic shift in compari-son with the stories without a topic shift (?=0.085, t=2.79; p=0.004), indicating that participants ex-pected to see the subject of the previous sentence instead of a new referent.
However, there was no significant contribution of WM load.
Analyzing the remaining regions of sentence 2 did not show an effect of Topic shift or WM load.
In sentences 3 and 4, we did not find significant effects of Topic shift or WM load, nor an interaction between these two factors.
To summarize, we found an effect of WM load in the first sentence and an effect of Topic shift in the second sentence.
The longer reading times on the first sentence in the high WM load condition probably reflect some final rehearsing of the dig-its.
However, after this first sentence, no effect of WM load is found.
4 Discussion We predicted, on the basis of our cognitive model, that adults will show more difficulties in process-ing a topic shift in higher WM load conditions.
We performed a dual-task experiment to investi-gate this prediction.
We hypothesized that as WM load increased, adult readers would show a sig-nificant decrease in their preferences for the sec-ond character as the referent of a pronoun in the stories with a topic shift.
In addition, we expected an increase in reading times in stories with a topic shift as a result of the topic shift, but we expected that this increase would diminish in the high WM load condition.
The off-line data support the prediction of the model: participants selected the first character as the referent of the ambiguous pronoun signifi-cantly more often in the high WM load condition.
No differences in reaction times were found, sug-gesting that the comprehension questions were2 Analysis of the absolute reading times revealed the same effects.
The reading times of region 1 were included in the analysis of the absolute reading times.similarly difficult to answer for the two types of stories.
With respect to the reading times, we found an increase in reading times immediately after pre-senting a new referent in subject position, which indicates that readers expected to see the subject of the previous sentence instead of a new referent.
However, we did not measure a significant inter-action between WM load and type of story.
Dif-ferent explanations are possible for why this interaction did not reach significance, contrary to our expectations.
It could be that WM load does not affect the processing of the sentence, but only affects the updating of the discourse representation with new sentence information.
In that case, sen-tence wrap-up effects could have masked the ef-fects of WM load.
An alternative explanation is that the moving-window task is not suited to de-tect the effect of WM load.
It is reasonable to as-sume that the effect of WM load on the topic shift is spread out over different regions, and is thus more difficult to detect.
ERP studies provide sup-port for this explanation, because for unexpected noun phrases readers show an ERP effect 300-600 ms after the determiner of the unexpected noun phrase (Otten & Van Berkum, 2009), which is much longer than it took participants in our ex-periment to read one region.
The link between WM capacity and language processing is not new.
For example, within the context of ACT-R, Lewis and Vasishth (2005) have explained difficulties in sentence processing, which have been attributed to WM load, by ACT-R?s fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference in the retrieval of chunks.
The fluctu-ating activation of chunks also plays a role in our account of the interpretation of pronouns in dis-course.
This implementation is consistent with the memory account of Foraker and McElree (2007) that characterizes the prominence of discourse elements as differences in strength of their repre-sentations in memory (in contrast with a.o.
Grosz et al, 1995; Gundel et al, 1993).
Our implementa-tion is similar to the account of Reitter, Keller and Moore (2011), who use ACT-R?s spreading acti-vation mechanism to explain short-term priming of syntactical structures.
In addition, to explain the difference between children?s and adults?
per-formance, we implemented the WM theory of Daily, Lovett, and Reder (2001), who manipulated the amount of spreading activation to account for73individual differences in working memory capac-ity on digit span tasks.
Our account is also in line with previously pro-posed computational models in different frame-works that explain the relation between WM capacity and language processing, such as CC READER (Just & Carpenter, 1992), or 4CAPS (Just & Varma, 2007).
In these models, WM ca-pacity is implemented as a limited amount of acti-vation that is used for storage of intermediate results and for computation.
The amount of activa-tion is different for individuals.
If more capacity is required for processing or storage than is avail-able, this will result in longer processing times or retrieval errors.
On the basis of this theory, Dane-man and Carpenter (1980) predicted longer read-ing times on discourse pronouns for readers with a low WM capacity.
In contrast, MacDonald and Christiansen (2002) have argued against the lim-ited capacity theory of Just and Carpenter: they propose instead that differences in WM capacity are differences in skill that arise from variations in exposure to the language, and biological differ-ences.
However, our data that shows that WM load can affect the interpretation of stories with a topic shift, is difficult to explain in terms of lan-guage skills.
To conclude, on the basis of earlier research (Koster et al, in press) we hypothesized that lim-ited WM capacity might cause decreased compre-hension of stories with a topic shift.
To investigate how WM capacity affects the comprehension of the discourse structure, we implemented a cogni-tive model.
Our model implied that sufficient WM capacity is necessary for an adult-like interpreta-tion of a potentially ambiguous subject pronoun.
With sufficient WM capacity, information about the grammatical roles of the referents in the previ-ous sentence determines the interpretation of the ambiguous pronoun, but readers or listeners with-out sufficient WM capacity rely more on the base level activation of discourse elements.
To test whether adults?
performance would decrease when their WM is taxed, we performed a dual-task ex-periment in which we manipulated the WM load.
The results confirmed that with higher WM load, adults are less likely to distinguish between stories with and without a topic shift, similarly to chil-dren.
Thus WM load can affect the interpretation of ambiguous subject pronouns.References Anderson, J. R. (2007).
