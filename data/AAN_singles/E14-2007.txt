Currently, at the end ofthe second year, the tool includes an array of inno-vative features that combine to offer a rich, user-focused working environment not available in anyother CAT tool.CASMACAT works in close collaboration withthe MATECAT project2, another open-source web-based CAT tool.
However, while MATECAT isconcerned with conventional CAT, CASMACAT isfocused on enhancing user interaction and facili-tating the real-time involvement of human trans-lators.
In particular, CASMACAT provides highlyinteractive editing and logging features.1http://www.casmacat.eu2http://www.matecat.comThrough this combined effort, we hope to fosterfurther research in the area of CAT tools that im-prove the translation workflow while appealing toboth professional and amateur translators withoutadvanced technical skills.GUIwebserverCATserverMTserverJavascript      PHPPythonPythonweb socketHTTPHTTPFigure 1: Modular design of the workbench: Web-based components (GUI and web server), CATserver and MT server can be swapped out.2 Design and componentsThe overall design of the CASMACAT workbenchis modular.
The system consists of four com-ponents.
(1) a front-end GUI implemented inHTML5 and JavaScript; (2) a back-end imple-mented in PHP; (3) a CAT server that manages theediting process and communicates with the GUIthrough web sockets; (4) a machine translation(MT) server that provides raw translation of sourcetext as well as additional information, such as asearch graph that efficiently encodes alternativetranslation options.
Figure 1 illustrates how thesecomponents interact with each other.
The CATand MT servers are written in Python and inter-act with a number of software components imple-mented in C++.
All recorded information (source,translations, edit logs) is permanently stored in aMySQL database.These components communicate through awell-defined API, so that alternative implementa-tions can be used.
This modular architecture al-25Figure 2: Translation view for an interactive post-editing task.lows the system to be used partially.
For instance,the CAT and MT servers can be used separately aspart of a larger translation workflow, or only as afront-end when an existing MT solution is alreadyin place.2.1 CAT serverSome of the interactive features of CASMACATrequire real-time interaction, such as interactivetext-prediction (ITP), so establishing an HTTPconnection every time would cause a significantnetwork overhead.
Instead, the CAT server relieson web sockets, by means of Python?s Tornadio.When interactive translation prediction is en-abled, the CAT server first requests a translationtogether with the search graph of the current seg-ment from the MT server.
It keeps a copy of thesearch graph and constantly updates and visualizesthe translation prediction based on the edit actionsof the human translator.2.2 MT serverMany of the functions of the CAT server requireinformation from an MT server.
This informationincludes not only the translation of the input sen-tence, but also n-best lists, search graphs, wordalignments, and so on.
Currently, the CASMACATworkbench supports two different MT servers:Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and Thot (Ortiz-Mart?
?nez et al., 2005).The main call to the MT server is a request fora translation.
The request includes the source sen-tence, source and target language, and optionallya user ID.
The MT server returns an JSON object,following an API based on Google Translate.3 Graphical User InterfaceDifferent views, based on the MATECAT GUI,perform different tasks.
The translation view isthe primary one, used when translating or post-editing, including logging functions about thetranslation/post-editing process.
Other views im-plement interfaces to upload new documents or tomanage the documents that are already in the sys-tem.
Additionally, a replay view can visualize alledit actions for a particular user session, includingeye tracking information, if available.3.1 Post-EditingIn the translation view (Figure 2), the documentis presented in segments and the assistance fea-tures provided by CASMACAT work at the segmentlevel.
If working in a post-editing task withoutITP, up to three MT or TM suggestions are pro-vided for the user to choose.
Keyboard shortcutsare available for performing routine tasks, for in-stance, loading the next segment or copying sourcetext into the edit box.
The user can assign differentstatus to each segment, for instance, ?translated?for finished ones or ?draft?
for segments that stillneed to be reviewed.
Once finished, the translateddocument can be downloaded in XLIFF format.3In the translation view, all user actions re-lated to the translation task (e.g.
typing activity,mouse moves, selection of TM proposals, etc.)
arerecorded by the logging module, collecting valu-able information for off-line analyses.3.2 Interactive Translation PredictionHere we briefly describe the main advanced CATfeatures implemented in the workbench so far.Intelligent Autocompletion: ITP takes placeevery time a keystroke is detected by the sys-tem (Barrachina et al., 2009).
In such event, thesystem produces a prediction for the rest of thesentence according to the text that the user has al-ready entered.
This prediction is placed at the rightof the text cursor.Confidence Measures: Confidence mea-sures (CMs) have two main applications in3XLIFF is a popular format in the translation industry.26MT (Gonz?alez-Rubio et al., 2010).
Firstly, CMsallow the user to clearly spot wrong translations(e.g., by rendering in red those translationswith very low confidence according to the MTmodule).
Secondly, CMs can also inform the userabout the translated words that are dubious, butstill have a chance of being correct (e.g., renderedin orange).
Figure 3 illustrates this.Figure 3: Visualisation of Confidence MeasuresPrediction Length Control: Providing the userwith a new prediction whenever a key is pressedhas been proved to be cognitively demanding (Al-abau et al., 2012).
Therefore, the GUI just displaysthe prediction up to the first wrong word accordingto the CMs provided by the system (Figure 4).Figure 4: Prediction Length ControlSearch and Replace: Most of CAT tools pro-vide the user with intelligent search and replacefunctions for fast text revision.
CASMACAT fea-tures a straightforward function to run search andreplacement rules on the fly.Word Alignment Information: Alignment ofsource and target words is an important part ofthe translation process (Brown et al., 1993).
Todisplay their correspondence, they are hihglightedevery time the user places the mouse or the textcursor on a word; see Figure 5.. .

.Figure 5: Visualisation of Word AlignmentPrediction Rejection: With the purpose of eas-ing user interaction, CASMACAT also supports aone-click rejection feature (Sanchis-Trilles et al.,2008).
This feature invalidates the current predic-tion made for the sentence that is being translated,and provides the user with an alternate one.3.3 Replay mode and logging functionsThe CASMACAT workbench implements detailedlogging of user activity data, which enables bothautomatic analysis of translator behaviour andretrospective replay of a user session.
Replaytakes place in the translation view of the GUIand it displays the screen status of the recordedtranslation/post-editing process.
The workbenchalso features a plugin to enrich the replay modewith gaze data coming from an eye-tracker.
Thiseye-tracking integration is possible through aproject-developed web browser extension which,at the moment, has only been fully tested with SR-Research EyeLinks4.4 E-pen InteractionE-pen interaction is intended to be a complemen-tary input rather than a substitution of the key-board.
The GUI features the minimum compo-nents necessary for e-pen interaction; see Figure 6.When the e-pen is enabled, the display of the cur-rent segment is changed so that the source seg-ment is shown above the target segment.
Then thedrawing area is maximised horizontally, facilitat-ing handwriting, particularly in tablet devices.
AnHTML canvas is also added over the target seg-ment, where the user?s drawings are handled.
Thisis achieved by means of MINGESTURES (Leivaet al., 2013), a highly accurate, high-performancegesture set for interactive text editing that can dis-tinguish between gestures and handwriting.
Ges-tures are recognised on the client side so the re-sponse is almost immediate.
Conversely, whenhandwritten text is detected, the pen strokes aresent to the server.
The hand-written text recog-nition (HTR) server is based on iAtros, an opensource HMM decoder.if any feature notis available on your networksubstitutionFigure 6: Word substitution with e-pen interaction5 EvaluationThe CASMACAT workbench was recently evalu-ated in a field trial at Celer Soluciones SL, alanguage service provider based in Spain.
Thetrial involved nine professional translators work-ing with the workbench to complete different post-editing tasks from English into Spanish.
The pur-4http://www.sr-research.com27pose of this evaluation was to establish which ofthe workbench features are most useful to profes-sional translators.
Three different configurationswere tested:?
PE: The CASMACAT workbench was usedonly for conventional post-editing, withoutany additional features.?
IA: Only the Intelligent Autocompletion fea-ture was enabled.
This feature was tested sep-arately because it was observed that humantranslators substantially change the way theyinteract with the system.?
ITP: All features described in Section 3.2were included in this configuration, except-ing CMs, which were deemed to be not accu-rate enough for use in a human evaluation.For each configuration, we measured the aver-age time taken by the translator to produce the fi-nal translation (on a segment basis), and the aver-age number of edits required to produce the finaltranslation.
The results are shown in Table 1.Setup Avg.

13.67Table 1: Evaluation of the different configurationsof the CASMACAT workbench.
Edits are measuredin keystrokes, i.e., insertions and deletions.While differences between these numbers arenot statistically significant, the apparent slowdownin translation with ITP is due to the fact that alltranslators had experience in post-editing but noneof them had ever used a workbench featuring in-telligent autocompletion before.
Therefore, thesewere somewhat unsurprising results.In a post-trial survey, translators indicated that,on average, they liked the ITP system the best.They were not fully satisfied with the freedom ofinteractivity provided by the IA system.
The lackof any visual aid to control the intelligent auto-completions provided by the system made transla-tors think that they had to double-check any of theproposals made by the system when making onlya few edits.6 ConclusionsWe have introduced the current CASMACAT work-bench, a next-generation tool for computer as-sisted translation.
Each of the features availablein the most recent prototype of the workbench hasbeen explained.
Additionally, we have presentedan executive report of a field trial that evaluatedgenuine users?

Although E-pen interaction has not yetbeen evaluated outside of the laboratory, it will thesubject of future field trials, and a working demon-stration is available.AcknowledgementsWork supported by the European Union 7thFramework Program (FP7/2007-2013) under theCASMACAT project (grant agreement no287576).ReferencesVicent Alabau, Luis A.
