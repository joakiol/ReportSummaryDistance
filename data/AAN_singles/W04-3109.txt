Panel DiscussionPublisher Perspective on Broad Full-text Literature Access for TextMining in Academic and Corporate EndeavorsModerator: William Hayes, AstraZeneca R&DThere is a great deal of interest in obtaining access to the vast stores of full-text literature held bythe various publishers.
The need to balance a reduction of the restrictions on access with theprotection of the revenue streams of the publishers is critical.
Without the publishers, the contentwould not be available and support for several scientific societies would also disappear.
On theother hand, the value of the literature holdings, while it appears to be quite high, is not currentlyadequately exploited.
Text mining and more effective information retrieval is necessary to takefull advantage of the information captured by the millions of electronic journal articles currentlyavailable.The panel will discuss the issues involved in opening access to the literature holdings of thepublishers to both academic and corporate entities; it will also initiate conversations on effectivecompromises.Sample Questions:1.
How does loosening access restrictions on the full-text content endanger the publishingrevenue stream?2.
Why aren't the abstracting services sufficient to take advantage of the content?3.
In your opinion, does text mining extract all of the value from the content, obviating the needfor the content thereafter?4.
Can text mining help market journal content?Association for Computational Linguistics.Linking Biological Literature, Ontologies and Databases, pg.
