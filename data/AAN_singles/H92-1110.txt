NIST-DARPA Interagency Agreement:Spoken Language ProgramDavid S. Pallett, Principal InvestigatorNational Institute of Standards and TechnologyRoom A-216, Building 225 (Technology)Gaithersburg, MDPROJECT GOALS1.
To coordinate the design, development and distri-bution of speech and natural language corpora for theDARPA Spoken Language research community.2.
To design, coordinate implementation, and analyzeresults, of performance assessment "benchmark tests"for DARPA's speech recognition and spoken languageunderstanding systems.RECENT RESULTS1.
Completed production of the six-CD-ROM-set forATIS0, and made this available through the NationalTechnical Information Service.2.
Analyzed the results of the February 1991 BenchmarkTests.3.
Participated in the DARPA MADCOW Group andCCCC activities.4.
Screened and processed the ATIS MADCOWdata for production in recordable CD-ROM media (byMIT/LCS), distributed the resultant CD- ROMs, andmaintained "on-line" MADCOW data (e.g., transcrip-tions and other "ancillary files") for access via anony-mous ftp.5.
Prepared for and implemented the October 1991 ATIS"dry run" Benchmark Tests with MADCOW data anddeveloped specialized MADCOW Benchmark Test re-port generation software.6.
Prepared for and implemented the February 1992ATIS and CSR Benchmark Tests.7.
Screened and processed the Pilot CSR Corpusdata for production on recordable CD-ROM media (byMIT/LCS), and distributed the resultant CD-ROMs.8.
Acquired and installed hardware and software to per-mit CSR corpus collection and transcription at NIST,using MIT/LCS- developed software.9.
Implemented the February 1992 "dry run" Bench-mark Test for the CSR Pilot Corpus.10.
In collaboration with Texas Instruments (and usingNIST funding) prepared the TI-46 Word Isolated WordSpeaker Dependent Speech Database for production onCD-ROM media.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR1.
Acquire and install hardware and software to run theMIT/LCS "TINA" ATIS system for data collection atNIST for future phases of the MADCOW effort.2.
Acquire and install hardware and software to run theSki ATIS system for data collection at NIST for futurephases of the MADCOW effort.3.
Revise the NIST speech recognition scoring softwareto more readily accommodate corpora such as the CSRcorpus and to provide more informative diagnostics.4.
Develop a comprehensive speech data screening andquality assurance software package.5.
Acquire and make use of recordable CD-ROM tech-nology for limited distribution of speech corpora.6.
Collect, transcribe and annotate (as appropriate) alimited amount of training and test data for the ATISand CSR corpora.7.
Prepare for and implement Benchmark Tests for theRM, ATIS, and CSR domains (in the late Summer -early Fall 1992 time frame) as required by the DARPAProgram Manager and Coordinating Committee.477
