Centering in Dynamic SemanticsDanie l  HardtDepar tment  of Comput ing  SciencesVillanova UniversityVillanova, PA 19085hardt@vill, eduAbstractCentering theory posits a discoursecenter, a distinguished discourse n-tity that is the topic of a discourse.A simplified version of this theoryis developed in a Dynamic Seman-tics framework.
In dm resulting sys-tem, the mechanism of center sh/ftallows a simple, elegant analysis ofa variety of phenomena involvingsloppy identity in ellipsis at~d "pay-check pronom~s".1 In t roduct ionCentering (Grosz et al, 1995) and DynamicSemantics* both concern the sequential process-ing of discourses, with particular emphasis on theresolution of pronouns.
In Dynamic Semantics,the semantic structure of a discourse gives rise toconstraints on the resolution of anaphoric expres-sions.
Centering theory claims that a discoursealways has a single topic, or center.
Constraintson the resolution of anaphoric expressions arise,in part, from the ways in which the center canchange in a discourse.
There is an important dif-ference in the way discourses are viewed in Cen-tering and in Dynamic Semantics.
In DynamicSemantics, a discourse is viewed as a monotonicincrease in information, as discourse referents areconstantly added to the domain of discourse.
Cen-tering draws attention to a particular ole that adiscourse ntity can hold; fl:om time to time, t, hecurrent center will be shifted wit.h a new center.In this paper, I will implement a simplified versionof the centering theory in a dynamic system, andof phenomena involving sloppy identity in ellipsisand "paycheck pronouns".Since Montague, a major goal of semantics hasbeen to describe a compositional method for con-verting a syntactic representation f a sentenceinto a logical representation f the sentence mean-ing, and dmn to evaluate that representation withrespect o a given context.
A primary insight ofdynamic semantics i that sentences have a sys-tematic relation to context in two ways: not onlyare they evaluated with respect to the current con-text, but they also systematically change that con-text.
This insight has particular elevance \['or theapparent puzzle presented by sloppy identity andrelated phenomena.
While anaphoric expressionsare normally thought to be identical in meaning todmir antecedents, hey receive a different interpre-tation than their antecedents in these cases.
Giventhe dynamic perspective, the puzzle evaporates:the anaphoric expression and its antecedent mightrepresent exactly the same meaning, since mean-inn is fundamentally a potential to be evaluatedwith respect o some context.
What changes istile context, in the discourse intervening betweenantecedent and anaphoric expression.Consider the following example involvingsloppy identity in VP ellipsis:(1) Tom1 loves his1 cat.
John1 does too.\[loves hisl cat\]The sloppy reading results from a change incontext, in which the value of 1 becomes Johnrather than Tom.
This allows an extremely simpleaccount of the "recovery mechanism" involved insloppy identity; the elided VP is exactly identicalto its antecedent.
Several authors (Garden% 1991;Hardt, 1.994) have suggested a dynamic accountalong these lines, arguing that sloppy identity andrelated phenomena reflect the reassignment of anindex in tile discourse context.
2Alternative approaches postulate complex re-covery mechanisms for sloppy identity, such ashigher-order matchiug (Dalrymple et al, 1991)or the syntactic matching of parallel dependen-cies (Fiengo and May, 1994).
Below, I will arguethat tile dynamic account is more general and em-pirically adequate, as well as being simpler thanalternative accotmts.The clynamic account raises the following prob-lem: since the index of the tile initial "controller"is reassioned, it becomes inaccessible in subse-519served tor the discourse center, and the discoursecenter will always occupy another index as well as0.
We.
will us(; the * to designate references to thediscourse ce.nter.
Thus tim above examt)le will benotated as follows:(2) '.l.
'omj, loves his, (:at.
John2, does too.\[loves his.
cat\]In tile first senteIlce, To'm, is the value of ill-dex 1, and ix also the discourse center, i.e., thevalue of index 0.
The pronoun his* is equivalentto his0, and dins refers to tile discourse center.In tile secon(1 sentence, John becomes the valueof index 2, and also replaces 5Ibm as the discoursecenter and thus John becomes the value of index 0.This center shift gives rise to the sloppy reading.llowever, both 'Ibm and John remain a('eessible insubsequent discourse.The paper ix organized as follows: In SectionTwo, i present a dynamic fl'amework based onthe system described in (Muskens, 1996), withextensions for the discourse center, VP ellipsis,and t)ayt:heck t)ronouns.
Section Three (:oneernsan "expanded paradigm" for sloppy identity; it;is shown that the t)roposed approach uniformlyaccounts for a broad range of sloppy identity phe-nomena, including some not previously examinedin the literature.
Conclusions and plans for future.work are given in Section l~bur.2 A Dynamic  F rameworkThe basic dynamic framework is the dynamic logicsystem of (Muskens, 1996).
This framework has,for the sake of simplicity, restricted l;he studyof anaphora to pronouns that are extensionallyidentified with their antecedents :~.
I will extendMusk(ms' system to permit anaphora involvingVP's as well as NP's, and to allow antecedentsto be dynamic ms well as ordinary (extensional)objects.In Muskens' system, linearized I)RT boxes areintegrated with the type logic (Church, 1940) thatunderlies Montague Semantics.
Linearize(t DI{Tboxes are simply a more concise way of writingstandard DIt3 ~ boxes (Kamp, 1980).
Muskensshows that DR~I' boxes can t)e viewed as abbrevia-tions for expressions in ordinary type logic.
Con-sider the following discourse.
: tile; discourse: Ajfarmer walks.
H el laughed.This is represented by the following linearizedI)RT box:\[u:t \[ farrner(ul ), walk(u1 ),taugh(u~ )\]3There are several researchers who have extendeddynamic frameworks to account tbr ellipsis and re-lated phenomena: (Klein, 1984) is an early examt)le.lAsher, 1993) examines a variety of extensions to theI)R~.\[ ~ framework.
(van Eijek and Francez, 1993) ex~plorc similar issues of indexing and ellipsis in a dy~namic setting.
(Gardent, 1.99t) also extends a dy~namie semantics ystem for ellipsis and anaphora.This is an abbrevial;ion for dm following typelogic formula:Aij (i\[ut \]j Afarmer (u j )  Awalks(u:, j) Alaughs(u, j))In the above formula, the variables i and j ret)-resent inpul: and output st;ates, and tim variabh~u, (akin to a discourse marker) is a flln(:tion frolnstates to individuals, lit what, folk)ws, we usethe DltPF abbreviations without further comment,.The reader is referred to (Muskens, 11996) for fur--ther examl)les and the details of l;tl(', system.We now define a siinple fragment of English,base(1 on the one given in (Muskens, 1996).-> P,.lotu,,,, :W(\[u,,, =hc,  whereit ~ At,q \[I I'~q\]an(l -> ;walk -.

The l;ranslation for and is thesequencing operator, ;.
As described in (Musk(ms,1996), the sequencing of two boxes K,K' is an ab-breviation for the following type logic expression:\[K~; g2\]l -~{<i,j> I ~k (<i,k> ~ \[t~'t~ & <k, j> e \[K2~)}Typically, two DI/~.\[' boxes appearing in se-quence can be 'm, evged inLo a single box, consistingof the union of the discourse markers ill the twoboxes and the union of the conditions.
This is de-scribed in the Mcwi'n9 Lcmma of (Muskens, 1996,page 8).
In the representations that follow, wewill often merge boxes without (;Oltli\[lellt o silll-plify representations.
Ilowever, the merge of twoboxes is not always possible if there is a reas-sigmnent of an index, i(; will not be possible toperform the merge.
This will arise in the cases ofsloppy identity exalnined below.The above t\]'aginent, following the Kamp/ l te imaccounts, considers only one type of anaphora, in-volving individuals.
We will extend the fragmentin the following ways:?
we will add the idea of a di.scour.se center tothe system?
we will allow dynamic properties to be addedto contexts, as antecedents for VP ellipsis?
we will allow dynamic individuals to beadded to contexts, to accoullt for "paycheckpro l lO l l l lS  ~5202.1 D iscom'se  (~('nt e,rW(', de, film position 0 in Om context as t;h(; I)is-co'u, rse (,'cntc.r'.

In the first sentence, the centeris TOM.
The second sentence shifts the center toJOHN.
It is this change in context hat gives riseto the sloppy reading.
Thus a sloppy reading ismade possible when there is a center shift.Finally, we allow the possibility that, a propertymight be the discourse center.
This means wemust add an alternative rule for INFL, so that itadds a property that is the discourse CEntEr:INFL,~* ::>A PAx  \[Pn I P0 -=- P,~, Pn = P\] ;  P(x)2.3 Paycheck PronounsThe phenomenon of "paycheck pronouns",5 is il-lustrated by the following Example(6) Smith spent his paycheck.
Jones savedit.The reading of interest is where the pronoun"it" refers to Jones' paycheck, although its an-tecedent ("his paycheck") refers to Smith's pay-check.
Our account for this parallels the accountof sloppy identity in VP ellipsis.
The antecedent"hisi paycheck" introduces a dynamic individual:a relation between contexts that introduces i'spaycheck to the output context, where the valueof i is dEtErminEd by the input context.
The fol-lowing rule makes it possible for NP's like "hispaycheck" to add dynamic individuals to the con-text.his (he~'Sm) =>P, I xm = I of(u.
.un)\] ;xm(P J5This term comes from Kartunnen's example: Theman who gave his paycheck to his wife was wiserthan the one who gave it to his mistress.
Various ac-counts of this phenomenon have been proposed, suchas (Cooper, 1979; Engdahl, 1986; Jacobson, 1992;Gardent, 1991).
(Heim, 1990) proposed extending theSag/Williams account of VPE to the case of paycheckpronouns.
Gardent makes a proposal similar to thecurrent account: a dynamic approach in which pay-check pronouns and VPE are treated uniformly.We use variables of the form ui to denote ordi-nary extensional individuals; we use variables ofthe form xi to denote dynamic individuals.
Thereare two distinct effects on the output context.First, the dynamic individual Xm is added to con-text: this object addsan individual Um to a givencontext, such that Um is of un in that context.Second, Xm is applied to the property P2.
Thisactually adds u,~ to the current context.Finally, we need an alternative form for pro-nouns thai; refer to dynamic individuals:hen ~ 6 where 6 = dr(ant(he,~))The pronoun hen recovers xn from the currentcontext.
The desired reading can now be derivedas follows:(7) a. Smith spent his paycheck.
Jones savedit.b.
Smith1* PAST2 spend his* paychecka.Jones4* PASTa save ita.We take the two sentences individually.
Thefirst sentEnCE introduces the dynamic individualxa, as follows6:his* paychecka.
=>AP2 \[xa I xa = IP(\[u3 \] of(ua,u0), paycheck(u3)\];P(ua)) \];xa(P2)spend his* paycheck> =>Av \[xa I x3 = AP(\[ua \[ of(ua,uo), paycheck(ua)\];P(ua)) \];I spend(v,u')\])spend his* paychecka.Av \[xa Ix3 : IP(\[u3 I of(ua,u0), paycheck(ua)\];P(u:0) \];\[u3 I of(ua,uo), paycheck(ua)\];\[ I spcnd(v,ua)\]Smith ~* PAST2 spend his* paychecka.\[u0,Ul,P2,xa \]u0 = ul,ul = Smith,xa = AP(\[ua I of(ua,uo),paycheck(ua)\];P(ua))\];\[113 I of(ua,uo), payEheck(ua),spend(ul,ua)\]We continue with the second sentence.save it3AQAv(Q()m'\[ I save(v,u')\])) dr(ant(ita))We substitute the value of xa for dr(ant(ita)):save iraAQAv(Q(),u'\[ I save(v,u')\]))AP(\[ua I of(ua,u0),paycheck(ua)\];P (ua))\]We perform A reductions, resulting in:6To simplify the representation, weomit the valuesfor VP variables P2 and Ps, since they are not relevantto the current example.522save ita =>Av (\[ua \[ of(ua,u0),paye.heck(ua)\];\[I save(v,,:,)\]))Jones4* I'AST.5 save ita.
=>\[Uo,U4,1'5,ua luo = u4,u4=Jones, of(ua,uo) ,payeheck(ua), save(u4,ua)\]The coInplete discourse is rel)resented as fol-lows:Smith :t* PAST2 st)end his* t)ayche(:k:~..lones4* PAST5 save ita.
=>\[u0,ul,P2,xa \] u0 = u~ ,u~ = Smith,X 3 -=M'(\[ua I (,f(ua,u0),paydmek(u:,)\];P (Ua))\[ua \] of(ua,uo), payeheck(ua),st,end(u~ ,ua)\];\[uo,u4,Ps,ua luo = u4,u4=aones,of(ua,no),l,ayeheck(u:0, save(u4,ua)\]The dynamic individual xa adds the paycheckof u0 (the discourse center) to the context.
Inthe second sentence, the discourse center is ,\]o'n,c&Thus we get the reading in which "Jones savedJones' tmyeheek", as desired.3 An Expanded Parad igm tbrSloppy I dent i tyThe proposed theory permits a simple, llniforlntreatment of sloppy identity in VPE and pay-check pronouns.
This uniformity extends fln'ther.We simply permit sloppy identity for any pro-form, whenever the anliece(le.nl; contains a preformwithin it.
This is schematicMly represented as fol-lows:Cl .
.
.
b ,  .
.
.
.
\ [ , , , \ ]  .

b , " \ ](C1, C2: "controllers" of sloppy variable YP)Ilere, XP is the anl;ecedent for some preformXP' ,  and YP  is the sloppy variable~, i.e., a pro-form embedded within XP.
A sloppy reading re-suits whenever there is a center shift involvingC1 and C2.
That is, the interpretation of YPswitches from controller C1 to C2.Since the dynamic theory treats VP ellipsis uni-formly with NP proforms, XP and YP  both rangeover NP and VP.
This predicts four possibilities.All four possibilities in fact occur, as shown by thefollowing examples:(8) Tom \[v,' loves IN,' his\] cat\].
Johndoes too.
(9) Smith spent IN;' IN,' his\] paycheck\] .aeries saw;d it.
(10) I'll help you if you \[v*' want me to\[v*' \] \].
I'll kiss you even if you don't, rrThis example was provided by Marc Gawron(p.c.
), who attributed it to Carl Pollard.
(11) When Harry drinks, I always conceal\[NP my be l ie f  that  he shou ldn ' t\[vp \] \].
When he gambles, i can't con-ceal it.ExaInlfles (8) and (9) have already been dis-cussed.
(8) is the familiar (:as(', in which the VP an-tecedent (XP)  contains a sloppy pronoun (YP).YI '  switches from C1, ~lbm, to C2, John.
In ex-ample (9), we have at, NI' antecedent (XP)  con-taining a sloppy pronoun (YP),  and the two con-trollers tbr Y I  ) are Smith and Jones.
l,',xample(10) involves a VP anteee(lent ('ontaining a sloppyVP ellit)sis; l;he VP ellipsis switches from help youto kiss you.
Finally, example (1.1.)
involves an NPatttece(tent (:ontaining a sh)ppy VP ellipsis, switch-ing froIn drinks to gambles.We have already seen how the sloppy readingis derived for (St and for (9).
We now show thederiwttion tbr (10) (example (11) can be derivedin a similar fashion.

Below, we substitute thevalue Av(\[ I want(v,Po(t h))\]) for P~, and then sub-stitute the wflue Av(\[ \[ help(v,u:0\]) for P0, andapl)ly it to ua, giving the following, result:It WILL2* hel t) youa \[if\] youa PRES4 want me1 to2.It WlM, a* kiss youa \[even if\] youa 1)O4 NOT.

"center shiflT involving P2 ("help you")and P5 ("kiss you") that inakes thedesired read-ing possible.
That, is, "what ua doesn't want is for111 to  kiss ua".The dynamic theory explains all four of theseeases in the same way; the embedded proform inthe antecedent (:an be sloppy, because the con-troller for the embedded proform can undergo acenter shift.
The eases illustrated by (10) and (11.
)8We construct a representat, ion as if the connec-tives if and even if were simple conjunctions.
Thisallows us to avoid the complex issues involved in rep-resenting such "backwards conditionals" in a dynamicsystem.523have not, to my knowledge, been discussed t)revi-ously in the literature.
It is not clear how such ex-amt)les could be handled by alternative theories,such as (Fiengo and May, 1994) or (Dah'ymple l;al., 1991), since these theori(',s do not treat NPand VP anaphora in a uniform fashion.4 Conc lus ions  and  Future WorkThe dynamic perspective provides a Kameworkfor a silnple, intuitive account of sloppy identityand related phenomena, by explaining the inter-pretive facts in terms of changes in context.
Thisrequires contexts to change in a way that is some-what foreign to the dynamic perspective; a givenposition in tile (:ontext must be reassigned, or shiftits value.
To implement this, I have incorporatedthe notion of discourse center, together with theme('hanism of center shift, into a dynamic sys-rein.
This makes it possible to give a novel, dy-nalnie account of sloppy id(mtity t)henomena, ihave shown that this approach aeeotmts for anexpanded paradigm of sloppy identity, going be-yond tile data addressed in alternative a(:counts.In future work, we will investigate ineorI)oratingadditional aspects of centering theory, includingthe tbrward-looking centers list, and the prefer-en(;e orderings on transitions.5 AcknowledgmentsThanks to Claire Gardent, Aravind Joshi, Shah)mLappin, Mats Rooth, Stuart Shieber, Mark Steed-man, and Bonnie Webber for help in develoi)-ing tile basic aI)proach described in this pal)er.Thanks to ll,einhard Muskens for helpful con>ments on an earlier version of this work.
