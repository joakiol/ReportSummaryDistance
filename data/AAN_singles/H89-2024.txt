Text on Tap: the ACL/DCIMark LibermanAT&T Bell LaboratoriesIntroductionThere has been a recent upsurge of interest in computational studies of large bodies of text.
Theaim of such studies varies widely, from lexicography and studies of language change to automatic index-ing methods and statistical models for improving the performance of speech recognition systems andoptical character readers.
In general, corpus-based studies are critical for the development of adequatemodels of linguistic structure and for insights into the nature of language use.
However, research work-ers have been severely hampered by the lack of appropriate materials, and specifically by the lack of alarge enough body of text on which published results can be replicated or extended by others.Recognizing this problem, the Association for Computational Linguistics has established the ACLData Collection Initiative (ACL/DCI).
It provides the aegis of a not-for-profit scientific society to over-see the acquisition and preparation of a large text corpus to be made available for scientific research atcost and without royalties.
All materials submitted for inclusion in the collection will remain theexclusive property of the copyright holders (if any) for all other purposes.
Each applicant for data fromthe ACL/DCI will be required to sign an agreement ot to redistribute the data or make any direct com-mercial use; however, commercial pplication of "analytical materials" denved from the text, such asstatistical tables or grammar rules, is explicitly permitted.
There may be special restrictions on somematerials, but only if the restrictions do not compromise the central objective of providing general long-term access for research.The material in the ACL/DCI text corpus will be coded in a standard form based on SGML, theStandard Generalized Markup Language.
Over time, we hope to be able to incorporate annotationsreflecting consensuaUy approved linguistic features like part of speech and various aspects of syntacticand perhaps emantic structure.
Both the coding and the annotations will be coordinated with the workof the Text Encoding Initiative (TEl), a project to develop standards for coding and tagging a broadrange of different classes of texts to facilitate data interchange and further both research and thelanguage industries.
The TEl is jointly sponsored by the ACL, the Association for Computers and theHumanities, and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing.Although our initial efforts will concentrate on the collection of American English, we areinteracting with groups in other countries with respect o British English and other European languages,and we hope to extend the effort to other language families as well.History and Current MembershipThe ACL/DCI Committee was established in February of 1989.
Its current members are RobertAmsler (Bellcore), Bran Boguraev (IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and Cambridge University), KenChurch (AT&T Bell Laboratories), Ed Fox (Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University), Jim Gal-lagher (U.S. Department of Justice), Carole Hafner (Northeastern University), Judy Klavans (IBM T.J.Watson Research Center), Mark Liberman (AT&T Bell Laboratones), Mitch Marcus (University ofPennsylvania), Paul Martin (SRI International & MCC), Bob Mercer (IBM T.J. Watson ResearchCenter), Jan Pedersen (Xerox PARC), Paul Roossin (IBM T.J. Watson Research Center), Don Walker(Bellcore), Susan Warwick (ISSCO), and Antonio Zampolli (University of Pisa).
Liberman is chairingthe committee.So far, no funding has been obtained or applied for, other than what is implicit in the pro bono173efforts of the committee members.
Most business has been transacted by email or telephone, thus avoid-ing travel expenses, and various small out-of-pocket expenses (such as the cost of tapes) have beendonated by individual members.
However, the problems of acquisition, maintenance and distribution ofsuch a large body of material are beginning to outgrow the bounds of an all-volunteer ffort.Current Status of Collection EffortsDuring the eight months ince the committee was formed, we have obtained several hundred mil-lion words of diverse text.
Our current holdings are listed in Appendix A.
Perhaps a quarter of thismaterial has been (at least roughly) translated into the SGML-derived format in which it will be distri-buted.We have been given the right to distribute (the 1979 edition of) the Collins English Dictionary inelectronic form.Now that we have a fairly large quantity of text, we are beginning to turn our attention to issuesof balance in style, genre and topic: what Don Walker calls the "ecology of language."
Although whatwe have is quite diverse, there is obviously a lot left out -- we have no business letters, for instance; norepair manuals; no tabloid newspapers; no movie scripts; no poetry.Two areas where we plan to concentrate some effort next year are spoken materials, and non-English or multi-lingual text.Plans for DistributionWe plan to release a "sampler" tape of about 30 million words quite soon.
This is as much as willfit on one 12-inch reel of 9-track tape, using easily available (Lempel-Ziv) compression techniques.
Ofcourse, we will include the source code to the compression/uncompression pr grams.CD-ROM is probably the most appropriate format for distribution of the full database, although8-ram digital tape also has some fans.
We also would like to establish a clearing house for distributingappropriate results of research based on the collection; one promising example is the prospective "treebank" project at the University of Pennsylvania, which Mitch Marcus is describing at this workshop.Finally, we hope to distribute some simple programs for indexing, word concordancing, manipulating theSGML format, and so forth.Text Acquisition and Clean-up: Motivations for A Common EffortIn addition to the positive value of having a standard, generally available collection of text (andeventually speech), it's nice to avoid duplicating the often-painful process of obtaining and cleaning textmaterials.
Obtaining the text in the first place may require quite bit of negotiating, once the fight personto negotiate with is found.
Even if permission is easy to get, actually getting the tapes made and sentmay require some pestering and pleading.
Once the material arrives, it can sometimes be quite a bit ofwork to make it usable: the tapes are typically in an undocumented and somewhat complex format, andthe text itself may be encoded in an undocumented (and usually proprietary) typesetting language.
Also,the correspondance b tween the logical structure of the text and its typographical structure is oftenapproximate and errorful, so that some intelligence is required if the logical structure is to be recovered.In Appendix B, I've documented one example where decrypting the donated material was a non-trivial task, namely the Penta dump format of the Library of America volumes.
Luckily, most cases aremuch more straightforward than this; but even in more ordinary examples, the donated text must usuallybe massaged quite a bit (by programs, of course!
).What is SGML?SGML stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language.
As in the famous joke about the HolyRoman Empire, one may question whether SGML is truly standard, generalized, etc.
It is, at least, desig-nated as an international standard by ISO: specifically, ISO 8879.
It's designed to allow structural infor-marion to be added to a document by embedding user-defined sequences of text characters within thetext stream.174"Markup" is the term used to describe codes added to eleclronically prepared text to define thestructure of the text or the format in which it is to appear.
"Generalized markup" rises above the detailsof font definition, type size, exact page layout, etc., to specify more structural concepts uch as "head-ing," "footnote," "emphasis," etc.
SGML also makes it possible to define the characters used in a docu-ment.Overall, SGML provides not so much a system for markup as a framework for defining such sys-tems: it is almost infinitely flexible, with the benefits and drawbacks that this entails.
The standarditself is far too complex and abstract to permit a brief description -- even its syntax is almost arbitrarilyredefinable.
It descends towards mortal ken in the form of a reference concrete syntax defined in ISO8879, and one version has acquired the beginnings of a semantics though the publication of proposed tagsets and document type declarations (DTD's) by the Association of American Publishers.In the examples appended to this paper, the relevent aspects of SGML are mainly its defaultmethod for encoding labeled brackets, and its default set of representations for characters outside theascii (actually ISO 646) set.
The start of unit of type foo is coded as <foo>, and its end (in full form --we will avoid the thorny issue of shortrefs) is </foo>.
This obviously makes it easy to find foos in atext, at least for a computer, and a simple computer program can transform such a representation intoother formats that are easier for humans to read, if desired, as exemplified in samples 3 and 4.
Charac-ter sequences of the form "&X;" (where X is some ascii string not containing ';') are used to encodenon-ascii characters.
Thus 'e' with an acute accent is "&eacute;": there are plenty of such examples inthe French part of sample 8.At a minimum, SGML provides a useful interchange format; each researcher can easily write pro-grams to transform such materials into his or her preferred local form.
In association with the TEI, wehope to provide a consistent, complete, and well documented tag set, extending the AAP set; this hascertainly not yet been done, however.175Appendix A: ACL/DCI Materials, as of 10/89Department ofEnergy abstracts200,00 scientific abstracts, diverse topics (25 million words)Archives of the Challenger CommissionTranscripts of depositions and hearings about he space shuttle disaster (2.5 million words)Library of AmericaAmerican literary classics: 44 volumes (-130 books) promised-- (20 million words)11 volumes in hand, successfully decrypted:Twain, Melville, Franklin, Cather, O'Neill, Emerson, Adams, DuBois, etc.Golden Oldies (,public Domain, from various ources):Tristram Shandy, King James Bible, Federalist Papers etc.ACL and ACM materials (journals, proceedings etc.

reports...)176Appendix B: Empirical structure of Penta tape formatFirst level of record structure:The last 4 of every 514 bytes are two copies of the number of the tape file, in binary:0 0 0 0 for the first file, 0 1 0 1 for the second file, etc.
They must be removed as they cross-cuteverything that follows (text, headers, padding, whatever...)Second level of record structure:The remaining byte sequence is analyzed as a sequence of chunks like this:FF 0 4 : this begins a null-terminated label or filename; it is usually 14 characters long, but notalways.FB : this introduces 7 bytes of obscure signification; there is almost always one of these following anull-terminated label.FB X Y P Q : (where X, Y, P, Q are binary bytes of variable value) this introduces X Y bytes of data--i.e.
FB 1 0 P Q introduces 256 bytes, FB 0 CO P Q introduces 192 bytes.
The P Q isvariable and of obscure signification.
There are 0 or more of these following each filename/FBsequence.FC : following this there are nulls to EOF.Each labelled chunk is a chapter, a rifle, a table of contents, etc.
The chapters are in not in theirnormal order in the dump tape; in fact different books may well be intermingled promiscuously; so it isnecessary to break out each labelled chunk into a separate fi le.Third level of record structure:Within each labelled chunk (i.e.
file), ignore the first 478 bytes.
The remainder is divided intorecords of either 512 or 1024 bytes, depending on whether byte 40 of the record is 0 or 1.
In eithercase, discard the first 46 bytes of the record.
If the record is of length 512, byte 41 encodes the usefullength of the record as(466  - (239  - X)*2)In other words, for each decrement of byte 41 from 239, ignore two additional bytes at the end of therecord.
If the record is of length 1024, then there is a first subrecord of 46+500 bytes which is alwaysvalid, and then a second subrecord 12+466 bytes.
The 12-byte secondary header should be discarded; theamount of valid data in the following 466 bytes is determined by byte 7 in the second subrecord,according to the same formula used above.Note that end of each 1024- or 512-byte unit is padded, not with nulls, but with a repetition of thecorresponding portion of the previous full record.Last level of record structure.Within the useful portion of the file, as defined by the above procedure, discard 16 bytes everytime FF FC occurs.
These little cookies seem to function as counters.The file ends completely when FF FD occurs -- stuff following this seems to be random garbagerepeating some earlier material.
(Optionally) discard bytes valued 0, 0201, 0202, 0240: they seem to be redundant demarcators oftypographical codes.Results: merely an ordinary unpleasant typographer's tape...177Sample 1: Tom Sawyer, after removing dump format.

(produced by program from SGML version via troff)Silverfish and EarwigsSilverfish and earwigs are completely unrelated insects; however, they are two pests which are fre-quently found in houses.The silverfish is an insect which grows continually throughout i s life and feeds primarily on theglue used in book bindings, cardboard boxes and the like.
So, the places you're likely to have problemswith silverfish are around books and bookshelves.
Silverfish are capable of destroying books and othervaluable papers so if you find them in your house, you'll need to control them.
Any of the so-calledhousehold insecticides are capable of killing silverfish.The earwig is a different problem.
It's usually a pest in newer subdivisions where houses havebeen built in what was a wooded area.
Actually, it's not a case of the earwigs moving in on people, butpeople moving in on the earwigs.Earwigs don't harm people.
They don't bite, sting, or pinch.
But, they do look bad and they havean unpleasant odor when you step on them.
Of course, they can be a nuisance when they get inside thehouse.
They feed exclusively on insects and related animals.Your first line of defense against earwigs should be physically keeping the insects out of yourhouse by blocking areas around doors, windows and other places where they might enter the house.If you see that you need to resort o chemicals, spray in and around doorways, around patio areas,and indoors along baseboards.Advantages of Breast-feeding Your BabyThe American Pediatric Society recommends breast-feeding for infants because of the advantagesbreast-feeding offers both mother and baby.
Because the nutrients in breast milk are easily digested andideally suited to a baby's needs, breast milk alone can provide every nutrient a baby needs for the firstsix months of life.
Usually, no vitamin or mineral supplements are needed, but sometimes doctors mayprescribe vitamin D and iron for some babies, and they may urge mothers to give their breast-fed babiesfluoride supplements.Besides getting the nutrients they need, nursing babies also get other health benefits.
Nursinginfants have fewer gastronomical illnesses, such as vomiting and di~hea, and fewer respiratoryillnesses, such as colds and infections.
Breast-fed infants also have fewer allergic reactions than dobabies fed with bottles.Another advantage of breast-feeding is that nursing mothers don't have to buy, prepare and steril-ize bottles and formula.
Breast-feeding also helps new mothers return to their pre-pregnancy weightsbecause of the extra calories needed for milk production.Nursing mothers also report that the time spent breast-feeding their babies is a special time formother and baby.
This closeness i another advantage of breast-feeding.Breast-feeding gives babies a good start on life.
It can be a wonderful experience for mother andbaby.181Sample 6: Examples of headings from USDA Fact SheetsWatering Summer PlantsFebruary Gardening SuggestionsAjugaBoxwoodCrape MyrtleGardeniasHolliesHydrangea macrophylla - Big Leaf HydrangeaJuniperLigustrumLiriopeMahoniaMondo GrassNandinaPalmsPhotiniaPyracanthaVinesWax MyrtleAir LayeringControlling Powdery Mildew on ShrubsEspaliering ShrubsFertilizing ShrubsGround CoversWhen to Prune Flowering ShrubsPlanting TreesRadishesSubstitutions for Granulated SugarFreezing PoultryFreezing Baked GoodsThawing Frozen Foods SafelySelecting Containers for FreezingSack Lunches - Good Safety TipsFood Safety Tips for Handling LeftoversTips on Stonng Commercially Canned FoodsCooking Without SaltSo You Want to Cut Down on Sal t .

, ,</fimestamp id=canp~_860417.F>184Sample 8: Emerson, Formatted Version.NatureIntroductionOur age is retrospective.
It builds the sepulchres of the fathers.
It writes biographies, histories, andcriticism.
The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes.
Whyshould not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?
Why should not we have a poetry and phi-losophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs?Embosomed for a season in nature, whose floods of life stream around and through us, and invite us bythe powers they supply, to action proportioned to nature, why should we grope among the dry bones ofthe past, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe?
The sun shines to-dayalso.
There is more wool and flax in the fields.
There are new lands, new men, new thoughts.
Let usdemand our own works and laws and worship.Undoubtedly we have no questions to ask which are unanswerable.
We must trust the perfection ofthe creation so far, as to believe that whatever curiosity the order of things has awakened in our minds,the order of things can satisfy.
Every man's condition is a solution in hieroglyphic to those inquiries hewould put.
He acts it as life, before he apprehends it as truth.
In like manner, nature is already, in itsforms and tendencies, describing its own design.
Let us interrogate the great apparition, that shines sopeacefully around us.
Let us inquire, to what end is nature?All science has one aim, namely, to find a theory of nature.
We have theories of races and offunctions, but scarcely et a remote approach to an idea of creation.
We are now so far from the road totruth, that religious teachers dispute and hate each other, and speculative men are esteemed unsound andfrivolous.
But to a sound judgment, the most abstract truth is the most practical.
Whenever a true theoryappears, it will be its own evidence.
Its test is, that it will explain all phenomena.
Now many arethought not only unexplained but inexplicable; as language, sleep, madness, dreams, beasts, sex.Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul.
Strictly speaking,therefore, all that is separate from us, all which Philosophy distinguishes as the not me, that is, bothnature and art, all other men and my own body, must be ranked under this name, Nature.
In enumeratingthe values of nature and casting up their sum, I shall use the word in both senses;--in its common and inits philosophical import.
In inquiries so general as our present one, the inaccuracy is not material; noconfusion of thought will occur.
Nature, in the common sense, refers to essences unchanged by man;space, the air, the river, the leaf.
Art is applied to the mixture of his will with the same things, as in ahouse, a canal, a statue, a picture.
But his operations taken together are so insignificant, a little chipping,baking, patching, and washing, that in an impression so grand as that of the word on the human mind,they do not vary the result.185Sample 8: DOE Abstracts, Formatted Version.The workshop was held to collect current data on the experience with primary water stress corrosioncracking (PWSCC) of steam generator tubing and the related laboratory investigations.
Thirty-twopresentations were given covenng field experience, correlations of laboratory data on the field, and rela-tionship of material microstructure, stress, and environment to PWSCC.
The emphasis of the workshopwas more on the fundamentals associated with PWSCC yet culminated with several presentations onremedial measures.The /sup 252/Cf neutron spectrum has been measured at high energies with a miniature ionizationchamber and two different NE213 neutron detectors.
The {gamma}-ray background and the maincosmic background were suppressed by applying an efficient pulse shape n/({gamma},{mu}) discrimina-tion.
On the basis of the two-dimensional spectroscopy of neutron time-of-flight and scintillation pulseheight, the sliding bias method has been used to minimize experimental uncertainties.
The experimentaldata corrected for several systematic nfluences confirm earlier esults which show a trend similar to theNBS evaluation.
However, the final spectra obtained for both neutron detectors exhibit negative devia-tions (up to -10%) from the NBS curve in the 6-12 MeV range.
Finally, the experimental results of thiswork are compared with various statistical-model approaches to the/sup 252/Cf(sf) neutron spectrum.
16refs, 16 figs, 3 tabs.The effects of ion-implantation on the surface mechanical properties of ceramics is investigated.Changes in hardness and indentation fracture that occur in reaction-bonded silicon carbide, sialon, par-tiaUy stabilized zirconia and WC are all described.
These modifications are correlated to the structuralchanges brought about by the implantation process.A vertical fracture type reservoir is assumed with a production well, for studying the effect of heat con-duction to the response curve of the tracer using a mathematical model.
With the inlet and outlet of themodel located on the center axis of the fracture, flow in the fracture is always stationary.
The tracermoves along the flow while dispersing mixedly.
Inflow rate is 4 kg/s with an assumed inpermeabletemperature boundary rock of 1 (5 m) thickness around the fracture.
Tracer responses are calculatedwith distributed temperatures and even temperature in the fracture.
The width of flow inlet does notinfluence tracer esponse.
However, the height of the flow inlet and temperature distribution in the frac-ture greatly affect the response.
(18 refs, 9 figs, 2 tabs)Tools, equipment and weapons contaminated with radioactive, toxin, biological and/or chemical contam-inants are deposited in a cleaning chamber and are sprayed with a solvent under high pressure.
The sol-vent dislodges particulate contaminants and dissolves chemical agent contaminants and the solvent sosprayed containing both suspended and dissolved contaminants is drained to a distillation means.
Withinthe distillation means there is a neutralizing agent which deactivates the biological and toxin contam-inants and chemically oxidizes the chemical contaminants removed from the item being decontaminatedin the cleaning chamber.
Pure solvent vapor generated in the distillation means is condensed to a sol-vent tank for reuse in the spraying operation for further decontamination.
Drying of the tool, equipmentor weapon being decontaminated is accomplished by circulating hot, unsaturated solvent vapor throughthe cleaning chamber and about the item being decontaminated.We have studied the growth and metabolism of Syntrophomonas wolfei in pure culture with crotonate asthe energy source.
S. wolfei grows in crotonate mineral salts medium without rumen fluid with cobala-min, thymine, lipoic acid and biotin added.
However, after four to six transfers in this medium, growthceases, indicating that another vitamin is required.
The chemically defined medium allows large batchesof S. wolfei to be grown for enzyme purification.
All the enzymes involved in the oxidation ofcrotonyl-CoA to acetate have been detected.
The pure culture of S. wolfei or coculture of S. wolfeigrown with crotonate contain high activities of a crotonate: acetyl-CoA CoA-transferase activity.
Thisactivity is not detected in cocultures grown with butyrate...186121111116121111111121112211111111111111116232112111111112111111A-TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAABAABWAACEAACSAACSAACSRAADAAECAAFESAAGsAAHAAIAAIIAALAAAMAAOEAAOOAAPAAPBAAPMAAQSAARAARAASAASAASAASAASBAATAATRAAVAAVABABABABABAABAEABBABBABCABCDHWABEABGABLABLSSample 9: Acronym Dictionary Derived from DOE Abstracts.ataxia tslangiectasiaAnti-proton AccumulatorArachidonic acidAutomobile Associationadditional absorptionally1 alcoholamino acidandesine anorthositearachidonic acidaristolochic acidascorbic acidatomic absorptionatomic adsorptionazelaic acid \[HOOC(CH/sub 2/)/sub 7/COOH\]alxlominal aortic aneurysmamino acid analogsall-aluminium alloy conductorAdditional absorption bandsAntarctic Bottom WaterAutomation and Control ExperimentAirix~rne Activity Confinement SystemAutomated Access Control Systemall-alurninium conductor steel reinforcedatlanto-axial dislocationAustralian Atomic Energy CommissionArmy-Air Force Exchange Serviceaccumulations of autoradiographic grainsAccident Analysis Handbookaristolochic acid Iaristolochic acid I (AAI) and IIAmerican Association for Laboratory Accreditationatmosphere angular momentum functionAirborne Antarctic Ozone ExperimentAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngologyalumina-aluminum phosphateAmerican Association of Pathologists and BacteriologistsAmerican Association of Physicists in Medicineambient air quality standardsAssociation of American Railroadsalkali aggregate r actionAndersen air sampleratomic absorption spectrometryatomic absorption spectrophotometryatomic absorption spectroscopyaerodynamically airstaged burnerasymptomatic autoimmune thyroiditisAutomatic Alarm Testing Robotadeno-associated virusassault amphibious vehicleAgua BoaAharonov-Bohmasbestos bodiesatomic bremsstralalungabscisic acidAdult bovine aortic endothelialAllender, Bray and BardeenAsea Brown BovefiAnalysis of Benefits and CostsAmes-Bologna-CERN-Dortmund-Heidelberg-Wars awacetone-butanol-ethanolasymptotic branch of giantsatmospheric boundary layeralpine breaker liner support187Sample 10: Challenger Commission Interviews, Formatted Version.MR.
MOLESWORTH: This is Investigator John R. Molesworth, that's M-o-l-e-s-w-o-r-t-h, inter-viewing Mr. Kapp at the offices of Morton-Thiokol.Mr.
Kapp, will you give your name and position here and a brief description of your duties.MR.
KAPP: That's Jack Kapp --MR. MOLESWORTH: Spell your name, also.MR.
KAPP: K-a-p-p, "P" as in Paul.
My position with Morton-Thiokol is Manager of the AppliedMechanics Department.I am responsible in general for all of the structural analysis of all of the complements, rocketmotor complements, that Thiokol develops.
I have approximately 100 people working in my department.MR.
MOLESWORTH: How long have you worked here?MR.
KAPP: I've been at Thiokol about 27-1/2 years.MR.
MOLESWORTH: And you worked on the solid rocket motor?MR.
KAPP: I've been in this general area of work, structural analysis, for the full 27-1/2 years.Prior to that time, I have a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineenng and a master's degree inmechanical engineering that I obtained in 1969.
I have beeen in this line of work for the whole 27-1/2years, functioning as lead engineer, unit chief, then section supervisor, and then finally departmentmanager.As far as the Shuttle Program specifically is concerned, I have been involved with it from thevery inception, being assigned to the proposal team and working in various capacities with the structuralanalysis of the rocket motor case and more lately the nozzle and the propellant since that time.MR.
MOLESWORTH: Do you recall the telecon which was held on January 27th concerning thelaunching of 51-L?MR.
KAPP: Yes, sir, I do.
I did not take any personal notes at that time but I well remember theconversation.MR.
MOLESWORTH: Directing your attention to January 27th, when was the -- when did youfirst learn of any concern over the temperature at Cape Kennedy, and how were you involved in resolv-ing or researching any problem concerning the temperature?MR.
KAPP: Okay, let me retrogress just a little bit and lay some background.I have two individuals that work for me, one by the name of Roger Boisjoly, B-o-i-s-j-o-l-y.
Mr.Boisjoly is on my staff, and for the last many months has been given the specific assignment of workingvery closely with the SRM seals.I also have another individual, Mr Arnold Thompson, who is a section supervisor under me whois directly responsible for the structural analysis and design of the case.These two individuals have been very involved in the seal work for about six months to a year,even prior to that, but intensively for the last year.Because of their experience l vel, both of which are in the area of 30 years, I have not personallybeen as vitally involved in that area as I might if a more junior engineer had been involved.Now, having said that, about 3:45 on the afternoon of the 27th of January, Mr. Arnold Thompson,one of my section supervisors, come into mymost of the afternoon and that they had somepredicted at the Cape, they being primarily theproblem and develop solutions.office and indicated to me that they had been meetingvery serious concerns about the temperatures that wereO-ring task force that had been set up to investigate thisHe give me about a 15-minute synopsis of what his concerns were, indicating that the decisionhad been made to take those concerns to higher management.
At the time I told --MR. MOLESWORTH: Do you recall who he was meeting with, the names of the individuals?MR.
KAPP: I know that -- I know that Brian Russell was involved.
I know that Don Ketner wasinvolved, that Roger Boisjoly was involved, and there may have been others.MR.
MOLESWORTH: Okay, and was Arnie Thompson the spokesman for the group, or --MR. KAPP: I think not.
Arnie just -- I had to be informed, and I think Arnie just decided thetime has come to involve me.188
