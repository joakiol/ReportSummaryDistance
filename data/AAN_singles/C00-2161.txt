Querying Temporal Databases Using Controlled NaturalLanguage*Ran i  Nelken  N iss i ln  FrancezComputer  Science DepartmentThe TechnionHaifa 32000, IsraelAbst rac tRecent years have shown a surge in interest intemporal database systems, which allow users tostore time-dependent intbrmation.
We presenta novel controlled natural anguage interface totemporal databases, based on translating nat-ural language questions into SQL/Telnporal, atemporal database query language.
The syn-tactic analysis is done using the Type-LogicalGrammar framework, highlighting its utility not;only as a theoretical fralnework but also as apractical tool.
The semantic analysis is doneusing a novel theory of the semantics of tempo-ral questions, focusing on the role of temporalpreposition phrases rather than the more tradi-tional focus on tense and aspect.
Our transla-tion method is considerably simpler than pre-vious attempts in this direction.
We present aprototype software implementation.1 I n t roduct ionTraditionally, database management systemswere designed to store snapshot information,valid at a particular moment of time (state).Itowever, many applications require handlingdynamic time-dependent information, pertain-ing not only to the present, but also to thepast and future.
Adding temporal supportto databases has proved to be a surprisingly* This work was carried out as part of the researchproject "Semantics of Natural Language Temporal Ques-tions and Interfaces to Temporal Database Systems"sponsored by the Fund for interdisciplinary researdl, ad-ministered by the Israeli Academy of Science.
We thankMichael BShlen, Bob Carpenter and Andreas Steiner foreach allowing us to incorporate their software within ourown.
We also thank Yoad Winter and the anonymousreferees for helpful comments on a previous version ofthis paper.
The work of the second author was partiallysupported by the fund for the promotion of l'eseardl inthe Tcchniou.thorny issue (Tansel et el., 1993).
A re-cent drive to consolidate research efforts hasled to the design of a consensus temporaldata model and associated temporal databasequery language, SQL/Temporal, an extensionof the popular Structured Query Language(SQL) (Snodgrass, 2000).
1 SQL/?J)enlpora\] rep-resents a significant improvement over standardSQL in allowing programmers to express tem-poral queries (Snodgrass, 2000).
Since tempo-ral database (TI)B) implementations are stillin their infancy (Boehlen, 1995), there is lit-tle practical experience with SQL/Temporal; letalone experience of non-expert users.
However,it; is our belief that such users are bound to findthe expression of complex temporal queries inSQL/Temporal to be extremely difficult.In an attempt o counter this problem, wepresent a translation method from controllednatural anguage (NL) to SQL/Temporal.
Fol-lowing the standard pipeline architecture ofsuch methods, translation is done via an inter-mediate meaning representation language illus-trated in Figure 1.
NL questions are first parsedusing a grammar in the Type Logical Gram-mar (TLG) framework (Carpenter, 1998; Mor-rill, 1.998).
Simultaneously with parsing, the NLquestion is translated into a formula of a for-mal language called Lane, (Toman, 11.996), basedon the interval operators of (Allen, 1983).
Thetranslation is based on an independently moti-vated novel semantics of sentences modified bytemporal Preposition Ph, rases (PPs) (Pratt andFrancez 1997; 2000, Nelken and Francez 1999).The constructed LAno.
formula is then trans-tThrough continued design, SQL/Temporal hasevolved from predecessor versions named TSQL2 (Snod-grass, 1.995) and ATSQL2 (Boehlen et el., 1996).
It isexpected to be incorporated within the new version ofSQL named SQL3.1076la,ted into an SQl,/Teml)oral query, which issubsequently submitted to a. l)rototyl)e TI)B im-plementation for eva.luation.
Finally, the TI)B'sanswer is 1)resented to the user.Figure 1: The tr~nslation pipelineWe have implemented this method as a pro-totype software tool, called Q IYEI~TY, (allnost)an acronym lbr "Querying with 15'nglish, of l~cla-rio'hal Temporal Databases".
Parsing and trans-la.tion to I,Alle,, is done using the TLG Theo-rem Prover (C~u:penter, 1999).
The trmlslationfrom \['allen to SQL/Temporal is done using anadaptation of a tempera.1 logic (Ti,) to Aq'SQL2translator of (Boehlen et al, 1996).
The result-lag query is submitted to a prototype TI)B im-plementation, calle(l Timel)\]} (Steiner, 1{)97).T'he different modules are COul)led into an inte-grated system iml)lemented in Sicstus 1)rolog ona.
UNIX platform with a WW\?-l)ased gral)hi--caJ fi'ont-end.
We discuss some of the directionsrequired in order to turn the system fi:om a. re-search prototype to a working tool.2 Related  workThere is voluminous litera.ture on the designof Nil, interfaces to general (non-tenq)oral)databa.ses (see (lYrrault and Grosz, \]988;Col)estake and Jones, 1990; Androutsopoulos etal ,  1995) for surveys) and by now their maina,:lva.ntages and disadvantages are well under-stood.
Much less work has been devoted tothe design of Nil, interfa.ces to TDBs (C'lifford,1990; Hinrichs, 1988) or other computer sys-t(.
'nls involving a temporal dimension (Crouchand l)ulnm.n, 71993).
()f lYa, rticular relevanceis (Androutsopoulos, 1996), who presents a lin-guistically motivated translation method fi'omNL queries into TSQL2 using a.n ltl)SG (Pol-la, rd and Sag, 1.994) grammar and a TL as anintermediate representation language.
Our al)-1)l:oach shares many characte.ristics with (An-d routsopoulos, 1996), but there also importantdifl'erences, which we point out throughout thepaper.\?e I)egin our presentation of the.
translationmethod with a brief overview of the T\])I}, as itsstructure determines many of the deign choicesta.lw.n in devising the translation method.3 The  TDBA TDB is a two-sorted tirst-oMer structure.The domain consists of a Data Do'main, D, anda Temporal Domain of intervals, 7'/, detinedas follows.
Let Tp 1)e a. set (of time points)with a discrete linear order without endl)oints,<._ .7'1 is defined as the set of pairs : 7) =Z,)la _< b c Tu{-oo ,  oo}}.
a rdationaldatabase schema is a set, of single-sorted pred-icate symbols (H,1,..., l~k).
Given a relationaldatabase schelna p, a Tl)l} schema p' is the sol;3/  of two-sorted predicate sylnbols (l?11,..., \]~),where the sort of /?~ is D aritv(l~i) x TI.
ATI)13 instance of schema f is a set of relationsR\[ C l) arity(l{i) X 7), where each R~ is finite.For instance, assume a database schema pconsisting era  single binary predicate symbol'work, storing lbr each elnployee the departmentill which she is employed.
The Tl)l} schemap' consists of the relation wo'rk', called a valid-ti'mc state table, which adds a. temporal argu-nlent 1;o the original relation, caJled the valid-time of the table.
'\['he temporal argument canbe used to store the history (and 1)erhaps evenfuture plans) of departments in which eml)loyeesare employed.
Following a. suggestion of (An-droutsopoulos, 1996), we also include relationsmal)l)ing names of ca.lendricat i ems to tempo-ral intervals in p'.
For instance, we store a. rela-tion year  / ma.l)l)ing the year 2000 to the interval\[71.
\].2(100-3 J.
12.2000\] (which in turn is n lappe(tto an element of 7)).We now describe the translation process.4 The  t rans la t ion  processThe translation 1)recess a.ccepts input NL ques-tions in a controlled subset of Nil,.
Restrict-ing inl)ut language in this way enables e\[l'ectiveprocessing of a sufficiently rich fragment whileavoiding many of the well-know problems of un-restricted NI,.
We use a formal grammar in theTLG framework.
Our grammar is specially de-signed for use with ~ particular TDB schema.Future work will allow easier configuration ofthe grammar with respect o the schema.Our grammar is based on work on all inde-pendently motivated theory of the semantics oftelnt)orality.
Most of the research in this tield(see (Steedman, 1997) for a survey) has rocllsedon the issues of tense a.nd aspect.
\~e ha.ndletense, but purposefully not aspect, which plays1077an import,~nt role in (Androutsol)oulos , 1996).Aspect, which is used to retlect speal~ers' tempo-ral viewpoint with respect o reported situationsis an imi)ortant facet of NL temporality.
How-ever, its relevance to TDBs is questionable, as itis unlikely that a realistic TDI3 would actuallyencode such subjective viewpoints.
Moreover,handling aspect requires postulating a morecomplex data model.
For instance, (Androut-sopoulos, 1996) augments tile TDB model withevent-like "occurrence klentifiers", and adds a.nadditional argument to temt)oral relations indi-cating whether a given event has cuhninated ornot.
While such devices may perhaps be linguis-tically justified, it is unclear whether the TDI3community would adopt such augmentations ofthe model.Instead, following (Pratt and Vrancez, 2000;Nelken and Francez, 1999) our focus is on sen-tences modified by temporal PPs.
These PPsare analyzed as variants of standard general-ized quantifiers (Barwise and Cooper, 1981),in which qnantification is over: time.
Usingthis framework, we handle questions that re-fer explicitly to the temporal (timension (e.g.When/during which year .
.
. )
as well as ques-tions in which temporality is hnplied by theTI)B context (e.g.
Did Mary work in marketing?,Which employees worked in marketing?).
We ban-(lie both clausal a.nd phrasal teml)ora\] Pl)s (e.g.after John worked in R&D, during every year).
J\nimportant strength of this semantic theory isthat it; allows for arbitrary iteration of PPs (e.g.one month during every year until 1992).
In ad-dition, our grammar also handles qua.ntific~tionover individuals (e.g.
some employee), coordina-tion and negation.input questions are parsed using a lexicalizedtype-logical grammar.
Lexical items are ass(>elated with a syntactic ategory and a higher-order lambda-term representing its semantics.Taking advantage of 'I'LG's elegantly tight cou-pling of syntax and semantics, parsing and con-struction of a semantic representation i theform of an LAl le n Ibrmula proceed silnultane-onsly, in a bottom-up fashion.
\?e have foundusing TLG to be advantageous over a feature-structure based formalism (such as IIPSG asin (A ndroutsopoulos, 1996)), since formula con-struction is an integral part of the l)arslng anddoes not require complex ad-hoc manipulationsof feature structures.Using a particular grammar helps reducesome of the ambiguity inherent in unrestrictedNL.
For instance, whereas in general a preposi-tion such as at is ambiguous between a tempo-ral and a locative interpretation, the choice ofthe coml)lement NP relative to a given schema-induced grammar deterministically fixes the in-terpretation.
As another example, whereas it-erating several temporal PPs (e.g.
during somemonth every year) opens up exponential seep-ing possibilities, some choices are eliminated byworld knowledge, which is encoded in the gram-mar (e.g.
every year must have higher scope thansome month since months are included in yearsand not vice-versa).
In cases of remaining ambi-guity, Cite user is presented with all Cite distinctpossibilities.
Future work will allow the user: tolnalce informed choices between different possi-ble readings, e.g.
by presenting him with NLl)ara.phrases of the alternatives.\?e translate NI, questions into \],All(',,,- i f ' iremain reason for: not translating directly toSQl,/Temporal is that the \]atter is not closed\['or sub-formulae, i.e.
a sub-formula of a well-formed query is not necessarily well-formed.Since LAne, "is closed for" sub-formulae, composi-tionally constructing formulae while parsing ina bottom-u 1)fashion becomes much easier.I, An~, is defined as follows (Toman, 1996).I,et p be the database schema (1~, .

l,et:L ::=/~,~(x, I)ILA LI~LI~x.LI~I.LIx = yllc~Jwhere x ,y  are variables over D, x is a vectorof such variables, l, J are varlet)los or constantsover T\], and (r is one of the operators: precedes,meets, overlaps, equals, contains.
LAlien is de-fined as tile set of' \[brmulae p E L that con-Lain at most one free variable over TI.
Theanswer to a formula 90 relative to a TDB D is{x, l l> ~ :(x,  :)}.To illustrate, consider the NL question:During which years did Mary work in marketing?
'File I ,Alle n representation for" it is constructed ina bottom-up nla, nnel'.
The meaning representa-tion of the main clause Mary worked in marketingis constructed as:A J  _ /)In this formula, I denotes a Reichenbachian-like reference time, J denotes a time interval1078( I , r ing which Mary  worked in nia,rl(eA:\]nlg, whichis loca,l;od in the l)a,sl; (l;he conl;ribution ol7 thet, onse) a, nd is hicluded wil;hin 1.The me~miug o\[" the \['ull (lll(~,~lJon \]8 COil-structed 1)y a,l)t)lying th(; Inca, sing o\[' the \]lll;or-rclga,1;ive ton~l)oi:a,1 1)1 ) during which year i;o thelllea,ning o\[' Lho c.\[a, uso.
