We discuss the potential of this vastamount of data available now on the WorldWide Web nearly for every language, regard-ing both general and common topics as wellas the most obscure and specific ones.
To il-lustrate our ideas, we propose a case studyof seven wedding discussion fora in five lan-guages.1 Introduction to comparable corporaNearly every description of comparable corpora be-gins with the EAGLES (Expert Advisory Group onLanguage Engineering Standards) definition:1?A comparable corpus is one which selects simi-lar texts in more than one language or variety.
Thepossibilities of a comparable corpus are to com-pare different languages or varieties in similar cir-cumstances of communication, but avoiding the in-evitable distortion introduced by the translations ofa parallel corpus.?
(Maia, 2003), which also became nearly standardduring the recent years, emphasizes the fact thatcomparable monolingual corpora usually provide uswith much better linguistic quality and representa-tiveness than translated parallel corpora.
The otheradvantages over the parallel corpora, i.e.
amountand availability, are obvious.Nowadays, the most popular usage of compara-ble corpora is improving machine translation, more1http://www.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/corpustyp/node21.htmlprecisely, compensating the lack of parallel train-ing data.
The articles (Munteanu et al, 2004),(Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) and (Munteanu andMarcu, 2006) are introducing algorithms for ex-tracting parallel sentences and sub-sententional frag-ments from comparable corpora and using the auto-matically extracted parallel data for improving sta-tistical machine translation algorithms performance.Present day most popular comparable corporacome either from the newswire resources (AFP,Reuters, Xinhua), leading to data sets like LDCEnglish, Chinese and Arabic Gigaword, or fromWikipedia.
Mining Wikipedia became very popu-lar in the recent years.
For example, (Toma?s et al,2008) is exploring both parallel and comparable po-tential of Wikipedia, (Filatova, 2009) examines mul-tilingual aspects of a selected subset of Wikipediaand (Gamallo and Lo?pez, 2010) describes convert-ing Wikipedia into ?CorpusPedia?.2 Introduction to foraJust to avoid confusion: In this article, we focus onlyon fora or boards, i.e.
standalone discussion sites ona stated topic.
We are not talking about commentsaccompanying news articles or blog posts.The internet discussion fora cover, in surprisinglybig amounts of data and for many languages, themost unbelievable topics (real examples from theauthors?

People, who eat only cooked food.Mothers with young children, women trying to con-ceive, communities of people absolutely avoidingsex.
Fans of Volvo, BMW, Maserati, Trabant cars.Probably also in your country mothers like to talk96Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora, pages 96?101,49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,Portland, Oregon, 24 June 2011. c?2011 Association for Computational Linguisticsabout their children and men like to compare theirengine?s horse power.Everyone who has any specific interest or hobbyand is friendly with the web, probably knows at leastone discussion forum focused on his/her favouritetopic, inhabited by intelligent, friendly debaters pro-ducing interesting, on-topic content.
These types offora often have very active administrators, who cleanthe discussions from off-topics, vulgarities, movethe discussion threads into correct thematic cate-gories etc.
The administrators?
?tidying up?
effortcan be even regarded as a kind of annotation.The rapidly growing amount of web discussionfora was until now linguistically exploited only in astrictly monolingual manner.
To the best of our (andGoogle Scholar) knowledge, nobody has publishedany work regarding the possibility of using internetdiscussion fora as a multilingual source of data forlinguistic or machine translation purposes.2.1 Forum structureA typical forum is divided into thematic categories(larger fora split into boards and boards into cate-gories).
Every category usually contains from tensto thousands of separate discussions.
A discussionconsists of messages (posts) and sometimes its con-tent is further arranged using threads.A discussion should be placed in appropriate cat-egory and messages in the discussion should holdonto the discussion topic, otherwise the administra-tor removes the inappropriate messages or even thewhole discussion.Fora usually have an entire off-topic categorywhere their members can talk about anything ?out-of-domain?.To avoid spam, usually only registered memberscan contribute.
Some fora keep their memberlist vis-ible to the public, some do not.3 Why comparable fora?Besides their amount and availability, comparablefora have a few other advantages over other typesof comparable corpora.They contain ?spontaneous writing?
?
an original,previously unpublished content, which is almost cer-tainly not a translation of other language original.This is obviously not the case of parallel corpora,and we cannot be sure even for other popular com-parable corpora.
A journalist may be inspired by anews agency report or by another media source, anda Wikipedia author must also reconcile his claimswith existing resources, which more or less affectshis writing style.The other advantage is easier domain classifi-cation, or more effective pre-selection before run-ning an automatic parallel sentences alignment.
Ageneric newspaper article is provided only with atitle, language and release date.
A Wikipedia en-try has a title, history and is classified into a the-matic category.
Fora messages have both dates, titlesand category classifications and they are available inmuch larger amounts than Wikipedia entries and arecovering more thematic domains than news articles.4 A case study: wedding sitesAs a topic of our case study, we have chosen an eventwhich occurs to most of the people at least once intheir life ?
a wedding.4.1 General overviewWe looked over five language mutations of thesame forum operated by Asmira Company ?
Fi-nalstitch.co.uk (EN), Braupunkt.de (DE), Faire-lanoce.fr (FR), Mojasvadba.sk (SK), Beremese.cz(CZ); and two other fora, Brides.com/forums (EN2)and Organisation-mariage.net (FR2), which seem tobe larger and more popular in the target countries.We have manually examined fora sizes and possi-bilities of their alignment on the category level.Tables 1 and 2 summarize the total number of dis-cussions and messages contained in selected cate-gories, shared by most of the fora.
For the Asmirafora, we omitted the discussions accessible bothfrom CZ and SK sites.If we assume average length of a message to beabout 60 words (see below), the proposed sites giveus a few millions of words of multilingual compa-rable corpora in each category (focussed on very re-stricted topic, such as wedding clothes, or hairdress-ing & make-up) even for ?non-mainstream?
lan-guages, such as Czech or Slovak.4.2 Quantitative characteristicsIn order to learn more about the amount and textualquality of the data, we have downloaded all the con-97EN DE FR CZ SK EN2 FR2Ceremony and reception 389 280 232 1 532 2 345 N/A 1 536Wedding-preparations 474 417 654 916 1270 13632 1 873Date & location 63 119 154 839 529 371 N/ABeauty 68 47 74 472 794 2 858 2 452Wedding clothing 291 166 200 715 1 108 10 832After the wedding 37 47 47 236 245 1 530 390Table 1: Total number of discussions in the selected wedding fora.EN DE FR CZ SK EN2 FR2Ceremony and reception 3 863 3 947 4 174 43 436 64 273 N/A 19 002Wedding-preparations 4 908 4 987 8 867 51 880 27 837 130 408 24 585Date & location 1 004 1 988 3 178 550 969 279 091 24 513 N/ABeauty 692 852 1 462 32 118 32 620 15 946 38 582Wedding clothing 2 634 2 336 3 588 27 624 28 048 75 331After the wedding 527 1 012 1 065 30 588 18 090 23 612 6 286Table 2: Total number of messages in the selected wedding fora.tent of the five Asmira fora, extracted their messagesinto five monolingual corpora and measured somebasic characteristics of the texts.
The downloadingand extracting task needed about 20 minutes of cod-ing and a few days of waiting for the result (we didnot want to overload the fora webservers).Table 3 shows us average messages lengths (inwords) for particular categories of these fora.In graphs 1, 2 and 3, we present normalized sen-tence length distributions for particular fora.
ForEnglish and Czech, we added for comparison sen-tence length distributions of reference corpora ofcomparable sizes, i.e.
The Penn Treebank, train-ing set (Marcus et al, 1994), for English and TheCzech National Corpus, SYN2005 (CNC, 2005), forCzech.4.3 Examples of similar discussion topicsThe category distinction may be still too coarse forpotential alignment.
The site FR2 has a joint cate-gory for Beauty and Wedding clothing, and on thecontrary, it has separate categories for Wedding andReception.
Therefore, we tried to examine the foraon a deeper level.
In table 4, we present some exam-ples of discussions on the same topic.As you can guess, fully automatic alignment ofthe discussion titles will not be an easy task.

2) How to put together compara-ble fora in multiple languages and how to align theircategory hierarchy?5.1 Messages miningAccording to an internet source 2, about 96 % of in-ternet discussion fora are powered by two most pop-2http://www.qualityposts.com/ForumMarketShare.php0 20 40 60 80 100Sentence lengthRelativeFrequency0brautpunkt.defairelanoce.frmojasvatba.skFigure 3: The DE, FR and SK fora - sentence length dis-tributions.ular forum systems, phpBB and vBulletin, and an-other 3 % are powered by Simple Machines Forum,MyBB and Invision Power Board.Our observation is, that small hobby fora runmostly on unadapted (?as is?)
phpBB or another freesystem, while large commercial fora often have theirown systems.If you intend to automatically process only a fewselected fora, you will probably use XPath querieson the HTML Document Object Model.
Accordingto our experience, it is very easy and straightforwardtask to write a single wrapper for a particular forum.But it would be nice, of course, to have a generalsolution which does not rely on a fixed forum struc-ture.
Unfortunately, general web page cleaning al-gorithms, e.g.

ten tofifty rather small textual portions on one page).However, there are some invariants shared amongall types of fora 3.
The content is automatically gen-erated and therefore all the messages on one page(can be generalized to one site) usually ?look simi-lar?, in terms of HTML structure.
(Limanto et al,2005) exploits this fact and introduces a subtree-matching algorithm for detecting messages on a dis-cussion page.
(Li et al, 2009) proposes more com-plex algorithm which extracts not only the messagescontent but also the user profile information.5.2 Fora couplingThe task of optimal fora, categories, discussions,sentences and phrases alignment remains open.
Ourarticle is meant to be an inspiration, thus for now,we will not provide our reader with any surprisingpractical solutions, only with ideas.The sentence and sub-sentence level can be main-tained by existing automatic aligners.
For the rest,we believe that combined use of hierarchical struc-3and some other types of web sites, eg.
e-shops or blogsture of the fora together with terms, named entitiesor simple word translations can help.
For example,nearly every EU top level domain hosts a ?Volvo Fo-rum?
or ?Volvo Club?, and each Volvo Forum con-tains some portion of discussions mentioning modelnames, such as V70 or S60, in their titles.Besides, according to our case study, the amountof acquired data compared to the amount of hu-man effort should be reasonable even when cou-pling the fora sites and their top categories manu-ally.
Present day approaches to acquiring compara-ble corpora also require some human knowledge andeffort, e.g.
you need to pick out manually the mostreliable and appropriate news resources.6 ConclusionWe have proposed an idea of using co-existent webdiscussion fora in multiple languages addressing thesame topic as comparable corpora.
Our case studyshows that using this approach, one can acquire largeportions of comparable multilingual data with min-imal effort.
We also discussed related technical is-sues.You may ask, whether the forum language is theright (addition to a) training set for a machine trans-lation system.
The answer may depend on, whattype of system it is and what type of input do youwant to translate.
If you need to translate parliamen-tary proceedings, you will surely be more satisfiedwith parliament-only training data.
But do you wantan anything-to-speech machine translation system totalk to you like a parliamentary speaker, or like aWikipedia author, or like a friend of yours from yourfavourite community of interest?We hope that our article drew the attention of thelinguistic audience to this promising source of com-parable texts and we are looking forward to seeingsome interesting resources and applications.AcknowledgmentsThe research described here was supported by theproject GA405/09/0278 of the Grant Agency of theCzech Republic.100ReferencesCNC, 2005.
