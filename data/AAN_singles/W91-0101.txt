MONOTONICITY, HEADEDNESS, AND REVERSIBLE GRAMMARMartin KayXerox Palo Alto Research Center3333 Coyote Hill RoadPalo Alto, CA 94304ABSTRACTThe notion of reversibility that is salient for grammars rests on the idea that grammars are trans-ducers between strings of words and some more abstract meaning representation.
The grammaris reversible if the transducer will work in both directions.
The notion was important in drivingthe evolution from procedural grammar formalisms, like ATN, to declaritive formalisms, likeLFG and HPSG.
The key was to replace the setting of registers with the unification of logicalvariables.
The aim was to base grammars entirely on 'monotonic' operations.
An issue hasarisen more recently has to with the various notions of 'head of a construction'.
After an attemptto place reversible grammars in their historical perspective, I will discuss the relation betweenmon0tonicty and headedness.
