First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), pages 721?726,Montre?al, Canada, June 7-8, 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsSAGAN: A Machine Translation Approach forCross-Lingual Textual EntailmentJulio Castillo1,2 and Marina Cardenas21UNC-FaMAF, Argentina2UTN-FRC, Argentina{jotacastillo, ing.marinacardenas}@gmail.comAbstractThis paper describes our participation in thetask denominated Cross-Lingual Textual En-tailment (CLTE) for content synchronization.We represent an approach to CLTE  usingmachine translation to tackle the problem ofmultilinguality.
Our system resides on ma-chine learning and in the use of WordNet assemantic source knowledge.
Results are verypromising always achieving results abovemean score.1 IntroductionThis paper describes the participation of Sagan, aTE and CLTE system, in the new task of CrossLingual Textual Entailment for Content Synchro-nization.The objective of the Recognizing Textual En-tailment (RTE) task (Dagan et al, 2006) is deter-mining whether the meaning of a text fragment thatwe call hypothesis H can be inferred from anothertext fragment T. In this manner, we say that T en-tails H, if a person reading T would infer that H ismost likely true.
Thus, this definition assumescommon human understanding of language andcommon background knowledge.In that context, Cross-Lingual Textual Entail-ment addresses textual entailment recognition inthe challenging application scenario of contentsynchronization.
Thus, CLTE constitutes a gener-alization of Textual Entailment task (also Mono-lingual Textual Entailment) , but envisioning alarger number of application areas in NLP, includ-ing question answering, information retrieval, in-formation extraction, and document summariza-tion, across different languages.Content synchronization could be used to keepconsistence among documents written in differentlanguages.
For example, a CLTE system can beused in Wikipedia articles to inform lectors whichinformation is absent or inconsistent in comparisonto other page in a different language.This new task has to face more additional issuesthan monolingual TE.
Among them, we emphasizethe ambiguity, polysemy, and coverage of the re-sources.
Another additional problem is the necessi-ty for semantic inference across languages, and thelimited availability of multilingual knowledgeresources.The CLTE for content synchronization specifi-cally consist on determining the entailment rela-tionship between two text fragment T1 and T2which are assumed belong a related topic.Four alternatives are possible in this relation-ship:- Bidirectional : It is a semantic equivalence be-tween T1 and T2.- Forward : It is an unidirectional entailmentfrom T1 to T2.- Backward: It is an unidirectional entailmentfrom T2 to T1.- No Entailment: It means that there is no en-tailment between T1 and T2.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 de-scribes the relevant work done on cross-lingualtextual entailment and related tasks, Section 3 de-scribes the architecture of the system, then Section4 shows experiments and results; and finally Sec-721tion 5 summarize some conclusions and futurework.2 Related workIn this section we briefly describe two tasks thatare closely related to CLTE.2.1 Textual EntailmentThe objective of the recognizing textual entail-ment (RTE) task (Dagan et al, 2006) is determin-ing whether or not the meaning of a ??hypothesis??
(H) can be inferred from a ??text??
(T).The two-way RTE task consists of decidingwhether: T entails H, in which case the pair will bemarked as ??Entailment?
?, otherwise the pair willbe marked as ?
?No Entailment??.
This definition ofentailment is based on (and assumes) average hu-man understanding of language as well as averagebackground knowledge.Recently the RTE4 Challenge has changed to athree-way task (Bentivogli et al 2009) that consistsin distinguishing among ??Entailment?
?, ??Contra-diction??
and ??Unknown??
when there is no infor-mation to accept or reject the hypothesis.The RTE challenge has mutated over the years,aiming at accomplishing more accurate and specif-ic solutions; in 2009 the organizers proposed apilot task, the Textual Entailment Search(Bentivogli et al 2009), consisting in finding allthe sentences in a set of documents that entail agiven Hypothesis and since 2010 there is a NoveltyDetection Task, which means that RTE systems arerequired to judge whether the information con-tained in each H is novel with respect to (i.e., notentailed by) the information contained in the cor-pus.Thus, the new CLTE task can be thought as ageneralized problem of RTE, which has to facenew challenges as scarcity of resources to multi-lingual scenario, among others issues.2.2 Semantic Textual SimilarityThe pilot task STS was recently defined inSemeval 2012 (Aguirre et al, 2012) and has asmain objective measuring the degree of semanticequivalence between two text fragments.
STS isrelated to both Recognizing Textual Entailment(RTE) and Paraphrase Recognition, but has theadvantage of being a more suitable model for mul-tiple NLP applications.As mentioned before, the goal of the RTE task(Bentivogli et al 2009) is determining whether themeaning of a hypothesis H can be inferred from atext T. The main difference with STS is that STSconsists in determining how similar two text frag-ments are, in a range from 5 (total semanticequivalence) to 0 (no relation).
Thus, STS mainlydiffers from TE and Paraphrasing in that the classi-fication is graded instead of binary and also STSassumes bidirectional equivalence but in TE theequivalence is only directional.
In this manner,STS is filling the gap between TE and Paraphrase.2.3 Cross-Lingual Textual EntailmentThere are a few previous works on CLTE, thefirst one was the definition of this new task(Mehdad et al, 2010).
Afterwards, the creation ofCLTE corpus by using Mechanical Turk is de-scribed on (Negri et al, 2011) and a corpus freelyavailable for CLTE is published (Castillo, 2011).To our knowledge, two approach are proposedto address this new challenging task, one consist ofusing machine translation to move on towardsmonolingual textual entailment scenario and thenapply classic techniques for RTE (Mehdad et al,2010;  Castillo and Cardenas, 2011), and the otheris based on exploit databases of paraphrases(Mehdad et al, 2011).
Both techniques obtainedsimilar results and the accuracy achieved by themis not a statically significant difference.In previous work (Castillo, 2010; Castillo andCardenas, 2011) we addressed the CLTE focusingon English-Spanish language pair and released abilingual textual entailment corpus.
This paper isbased on that work in order to tackling the problemacross different language pairs Spanish-English(SPA-ENG), Italian-English (ITA-ENG), French-English (FRA-ENG) and German-English (GER-ENG) and we also used an approach based on ma-chine translation.3 System architectureSagan is a CLTE system (Castillo and Cardenas,2010) which has taken part of several challenges,including the Textual Analysis Conference 2009and TAC 2010, and the Semantic Textual Similari-722ty Semeval 2012 (Aguirre et al, 2012; Castillo andEstrella, 2012) and Cross Lingual Textual Entail-ment for content synchronization as part of theSemeval 2012 (Negri et al, 2012).The system is based on a machine learning ap-proach and it utilizes eight WordNet-based(Fellbaum, 1998) similarity measures with thepurpose of obtaining the maximum similarity be-tween two concepts.
We used SVM as classifierwith polynomial kernel.
The system determines theentailment based on the semantic similarity of twotexts (T,H) viewed as a function of the semanticsimilarity of the constituent words of both phrases.Thereby, we expect that combining word to wordsimilarity metrics to text level would be a goodindicator of text to text similarity.These text-to-text similarity measures are basedon the following word-to-word similarity metrics:(Resnik, 1995), (Lin, 1997), (Jiang and Conrath,1997), (Pirr?
and Seco, 2008), (Wu and Palmer,1994), Path Metric, (Leacock and Chodorow,1998), and a semantic similarity to sentence levelnamed SemSim (Castillo and Cardenas, 2010).Additional information about how to producefeature vectors as well as each word- and sentence-level metric can be found in (Castillo, 2011).
Thearchitecture of the system is shown in Figure 1.WordNet* CLTE_DEU-ENG,* CLTE_FRA-ENG,* CLTE_SPA-ENG,*CLTE_ITA-ENG,* CLTE_DEU+FRA+SPA+ITA-ENG,*CLTE_DEU+FRA+SPA+ITA-ENG+RTE3-TS-CL* CLTE_DEU-ENG,* CLTE_FRA-ENG,* CLTE_SPA-ENG,*CLTE_ITA-ENGCLTEAdaptation LayerTEengineEntailmentResultBidirectionalBackwardGoogleTraslateForwardKnowledge ResourcesWeb ResourcesTraining SetsTest SetsRTE3-4C+RTE4-4CRTE3-4CTraining SetsNoEntailmentPre-ProcessingFig.1.
System architectureIn the preprocessing module we performedstring normalization across different languages byusing a lookup table for lexical entries, and thendate and time normalization is carried out.CLTE adaption layer is composed by four ma-chine translation sub-modules that bring back each<Ti ,H> pair into the monolingual case ENG-ENG.Where Ti can be given in Spanish, German, Italianor French.The training set used to the submitted runs arewhose provided by the organizers of the CLTE forContent Synchronization Task and a combinationof RTE datasets, such as it is described in the Sec-tion Experiments and Results.4 Experiments and ResultsThe dataset provided by the organizers consists of500 CLTE pairs translated to four languages fol-lowing the crowdsourcing-based methodologyproposed in (Negri et al, 2011).
Also, for test pur-pose additional 500 pairs are provided.
Both da-tasets are balanced with respect to the fourentailment judgments (bidirectional, forward,backward, and no entailment).We also performed experiments using traditionalRTE datasets.
Because of the RTE datasets arebinary classified as NO (no-entailment) and YES(entailment), then we assumed that NO class is"no-entailment" and YES class is "forward" in theCLTE task.
Certainly, the corpus tagged in thisway will have contradictory information, sinceseveral pairs classified as forward should be classi-fied as bidirectional, and also several pairs classi-fied as no-entailment could be backwards, but theobjective is experimenting  whether we can gainaccuracy in our RTE system despite of these (few)contradictory cases.Additionally, in our experiments we used an al-gorithm (Castillo,2010) to generate additionaltraining data, in other words to expand a data set.
Itis based on a Double Translation Process (dtp) orround-trip translation.
Double translation processcan be defined as the process of starting with an S(String in English), translating it to a foreign lan-guage F(S), for example Spanish, and finally backinto the English source language F-1(S).We applied the algorithm starting with RTE3and RTE4 datasets.
Thus, the augmented corpus isdenoted RTE3-4C which is tagged according to thethree-way task composed of: 340 pairs Contradic-723tion, 1520 pairs Yes, and 1114 pairs Unknown.
Inthe case of the two-way task, it is composed by1454 pairs No, and 1520 pairs Yes.The other dataset augmented is denoted RTE4-4C, and has the following composition: 546 pairsContradiction, 1812 pairs Entailment, and 1272pairs Unknown.
Therefore, in the two-way task,there are 1818 pairs No (No Entailment), and 1812pairs Yes (Entailment) in this data set.The idea behind using RTE3-4C and RTE3-4Cis providing to our system an increased datasetaiming to acquire more semantic variability.In our system submission we report the experi-ments performed with the test sets provided byCLTE organizers which is composed by four da-tasets of 500 pairs each one.4.1 Submission to the CLTE shared taskWith the aims of applying the monolingual textualentailment techniques, in the CLTE domain, weutilized the Google translate as MT system to bringback the <T,H> pairs into the monolingual case.Then we generated a feature vector for every<T,H> pair with both training and test sets, andused monolingual textual entailment engine toclassify the pairs.
First we described the datasetused and then explain each submitted run.The datasets used are listed below:- CLTE_Esp+Fra+Ita+Ger: dataset composedby all language pairs.- RTE3-TS-CL: a ENG-SPA cross lingual tex-tual entailment corpus (Castillo,2011) composedby 200 pairs (108 Entailment, 32 Contradiction, 60Unknown).- RTE3-4C: an augmented dataset based onRTE3.- RTE4-4C: an augmented dataset based onRTE4.Our participation in the shared task consisted offour different runs produced with the same featureset, and the main differences rely on the amountand type of training data.
Each run is describedbelow:- RUN1: system trained on CLTE_Esp+Fra+Ger+Ita corpus in addition to the RTE3-TS-CL dataset.- RUN2: system trained on CLTE_Esp,CLTE_Fra, CLTE_Ger and CLTE_Ita corpus.
Attesting phase, the system chooses the right datasetaccording to the language that it is processing.-  RUN3: system trained using all training datathat came from different language pairs.We remark that we can combine the training da-ta because of we used a machine translation sub-module that bring back each <T,H> pair into themonolingual case ENG-ENG.-  RUN4: In RUN4 the training set is com-posed by all pairs of CLTE_Esp+Fra+Ita+Ger andRTE3-4C+ RTE4-4C datasets.Ten teams participated in this CLTE task, eightsubmitting runs to all language pairs.
For Spanish28 runs were submitted and 20 runs were submit-ted for the other languages.
The results achievedby our system is showed in Table 1.Team idTeamsystemidScore (Accuracy) Run RankSPA-ENGITA-ENGFRA-ENGDEU-ENGSPA ITA FRA DEUSagan run1 0.342 0.352 0.346 0.342 16 6 9 9Sagan run2 0.328 0.352 0.336 0.310 19 7 11 13Sagan run3 0.346 0.356 0.330 0.332 14 5 12 12Sagan run4 0.340 0.330 0.310 0.310 17 12 13 14SystemRank7 4 5 6The results reported show that our best run isranking above the average for all languages.
Thesame situation occurs when ranking the systems,except for Spanish where the system is placed on7th among 10 teams.We achieved the highest result of 0.356 withRUN3 in the pair ITA-ENG which is placed fourthamong participating systems.We also note that, in general, training the systemwith the pairs of all datasets achieved better resultsthan training separately for each dataset.
Further-more, if we analyze RUN4 vs. RUN3 we can con-clude that incorporating additional RTE datasetproduces a very unbalanced dataset resulting in adecrease in performance.
In (Castillo, 2011) weexperimented with these expanded datasets overmonolingual RTE and CLTE tasks and we showedgain in performance, thus we suspect that the de-crease is more due to unbalanced dataset than tonoise introduced by the double translation process.Interesting, the Corpus RTE3-TS-CL dataset uti-lized in the RUN1 helps to improve the results inFRA-ENG and DEU-ENG language pairs.724The Table 2 shows that our system predict withhigh F-measure to bidirectional and no-entailmententailment judgments in all language pairs, but hasproblems to distinguish the forward and backwardentailment judgments.It is probably due to our systems is based onsemantic overlap between T and H, resulting thebackwards particularly difficult to predict to oursystem.RunidLanguagepairPrecisionRecallF-measure Score(Accuracy)Mean Score-all runsF B NE BI F B NE BI F B NE BIRun3 SPA-ENG 0.23 0.27 0.42 0.42 0.20 0.22 0.45 0.51 0.21 0.25 0.43 0.46 0.346 0.346Run3 ITA-ENG 0.31 0.25 0.40 0.46 0.30 0.22 0.51 0.40 0.30 0.23 0.45 0.43 0.356 0.336Run1 FRA-ENG 0.24 0.30 0.39   0.43 0.17 0.34 0.57 0.30 0.20 0.32 0.47 0.36 0.346 0.336Run1 DEU-ENG 0.25 0.23 0.41 0.44 0.17 0.26 0.60 0.34 0.20 0.25 0.49 0.39 0.342 0.336Table 2.
Official results for Precision, Recall and F-measure5 Conclusions and future workIn this paper we explained our participation in thenew challenging task of Cross-Lingual TextualEntailment (CLTE) for Content Synchronization.This task also could presents benefit as a metric formachine translation evaluation, as reported in(Castillo and Estrella, 2012).This work focuses on CLTE based on Machinetranslation to bring back the problem into the mon-olingual Textual Entailment (TE) scenario.
Thisdecoupled approach between Textual Entailmentand Machine Translation has several advantages,such as taking benefits of the most recent advancesin machine translation, the ability to test the effi-ciency of different MT systems, as well as the abil-ity to scale the system easily to any language pair.Results achieved are promising and additionalwork is needed in order to address the problem ofdistinguish among forward, backward and bidirec-tional entailment judgments.Future work will be oriented to tackle the prob-lem with backwards.
Finally, we remark the neces-sity of bigger corpus tagged in four-wayclassification, for all language pairs.ReferencesIdo Dagan, Oren Glickman and Bernardo Magnini.2006.
