De-spite their linfitations, selectional restrictionshave t)roven very useflfl in natural bmguage ap-pli('ations, where they have been used frequentlyin word sense disambiguation, syntactic disam-biguation, and anaphora resolution.
Given theirpractical wtlue, we explore two methods to in-corporate selectional restrictions in the HPSGtheory, assuming that the reader is familiar withHPSG.
The first method eml)loys ItPSG~S BACK-GROUND feature and a constraint-satisfactioncomt)onent t)il)e-lined after the parser.
Thesecond method uses subsorts of retbrential in-dices, and 1)locks readings that violat(', sole(:-tional restrictions during parsing.
While the-oretically less satisfactory, we have Ibund thesecond method particularly useflfl in the devel-opment of practical systems.1_ I n t roduct ion~lPhe term selectional restrictions refers to se-mantic sortal constraints imposed on the 1)ar -ticipants of linguistic constructions.
Selectionalrestrictions arc invoked, for example, to accounttbr the oddity of (1) and (3) (cf.
(2) and (4)).
(1) ?Tom ate a keyboard.
(2) Tom ate a banana.
(3) ?Tom repaired the technician.
(4) Tom repaired the keyboard.~IPo account br (1) and (2), one would typicallyintroduce a constraint requiring the object of"to eat" to denote an edible entity.
The odd-ity of (1) can then be attr ibuted to a violationof this constraint, since keyboards are typicallynot edible.
Silnilarly, in (3) and (4) one couldpostulate that "to repair" can only be used withobjects denoting artifacts.
This constraint is vi-olated by (3), because technicians are typicallypersons, and persons are not artifacts.We note that selectional restrictions attemptto capture contextually-dei)endent constraintson interpretation.
There is nothing inherentlywrong with (1), and one can think of specialcontexts (e.g.
where Tom is a circus pertbrmerwhose act includes gnawing on comtmter pe-ripherals) where (1) is felicitous.
The oddityof (1) is due to the fact that in most contextsl)eople do not eat keyboards.
Similarly, (3) isti;licitous in a science-fiction context where thetechnician is a robot, |rot not in most usual con-texts.
Selectional restrictions are typically usedto capture flints about tlm world which are gen-c.r~lly, but not necessarily, true.In w~rious forms, selectional restrictions havebeen used tbr many years, and their l imitationsare well-known (Allen, 1995).
For example,they cmmot account br lnetaphoric uses of lan-guage (e.g.
(5)), and they run into 1,roblen,s innegated sentences (e.g.
unlike (1), there is noth-ing odd about (6)).
(5) My car drinks gasoline.
(6) Tom cannot cat a keyboard.Despite their limitations, selectional restric-tions have proven very useflfl in practical appli-cations, and they have been employed in sev-eral large-scale natural language understandingsystems (Martin et al, 1086) (Alshawi, 1992).Apart fl'om blocking pragmatically i lMbrmedsentences like (1) and (3), selectional restric-tions can also be used in word sense disanfl)igua-tion, syntactic dismnbiguation, and anaphora15resolution.
In (7), for example, tile '))~qnter"refers to at computer peripheral, while in (8) itrefers to a person.
The correct sense of "printer"can be chosen in each case by requiring the ob-ject of "to repair" to denote an artifact, and thesubject of "to call" (when referring to a phonecall) to denote a person.
(7) Tom repaired the printer.
(8) The printer called this mornfilg.Silnilarly, (9) is from a syntactic point of viewpotentially ambiguous: the relative clause mayrefer either to the departments or the employ-ees.
The correct reading can be chosen by speci-fying that the subject of "retire" (the relativisednominal in this case) must denote a person.
(9) List tile employees of the overseas depart-nlents that will retire next year.Given tile value of selectional restrictions int)ractical applications, we explore how they canbe utilised in the HPS~ theory (Pollard andSag, 1994), assuming that the reader is familiarwith HPSG.
Onr  proposals are based on expe-rience obtained from using IIPSG in a naturallanguage database interface (Androutsot)ouloset al, 1998) and a dialogue system for a mobilerobot.
To the best of our knowledge, selectionalrestrictions have not been explored so far in thecontext of HPSG.We note that, although they often exploitsimilar techniques (e.g.
semantic sort hierar-chies), selectional restrictions costitnte a differ-ent topic from linking theories (Davis, 1996).Roughly speaking, linking theories explore therelation between thematic roles (e.g.
agent, pa-tient) and grammatical thnctions (e.g.
subject,complement), while selectional restrictions at-tempt to account br the types of world entitiesthat can fill the thematic roles.We discuss in sections 2 and 3 two ways thatwe have considered to incorporate selectionalrestrictions into HPSO.
Section 4 concludes bycomparing briefly the two approaches.2 Background res t r i c t ionsThe first way to accommodate selec-tional restrictions in HPSG USeS theCONTEXTIBACKGROUND (abbreviated hereas CXlBG) feature, which Pollard and Sag(Pollard and Sag, 1994) reserve tbr "Micityconditions on the utterance context", "presup-positions or conventional iml)licatures", and"at)prot)riateness conditions" (op cit pp.
27,332).
To express electional restrictions, we addqfpsoas (quantifier-flee parameterised statesof atfairs) with a single semantic role (slot)iI1 CXIBG.
1 For exanlple, apart fi'om the eatqf'psoa in its NUCLEUS (NUt), the lexical signtbr "ate" (shown in (10)) would introduce anedible qfpsoa in Bo, requiring \[\] (the entitydenoted by tile object of "ate") to be edible.
(10) "PIION (ate)CATSS I LOC CONT \[ NUCcx I ~(~\[ I,EAD lcTb l \ ] \ ]COMPS ( NP\[~J >i l lc.t \[,,~A'r,~N FlJ //In the case of lexical signs for proper names(e.g.
(11)), the treatment of Pollard and Saginserts a naming (namg) qfpsoa in BG, whichrequires the BEARER (BRER) to by identifiablein the context by means of the proper name.
(11) also requires the bearer to be a man.

This principle causes the BGvalue of each phrase to be the union of tile BGvalues of its daughters.
Assuming that the lex-ical sign of "keyboard" is (12), (10)-(12) cause(1) to receive (13), that requires \[\] to denote anedible keyboard.1To save space, we use qfpsoas wherever Pollard andSag use quantified psoas.
We also ignore tense and as-pect here.
Consult (Androutsopoulos et al, 1998) forthe treatment of tense and aspect in our ltpsG-baseddatabase interface.16(12)(13)/ \[INI)EX \[\]"PlIONSS I LOC(~/bm, ate, a, keyboard)-II\],;AI) verb 1CAT SUIL1 <> \[COMI'S ( )  J-QUANTS ( keybd \[INST \[~\]\])\] \[":a"E" Hm \] J CONT i NUC k I~A'rI':N eat|NAME :/bin|' /namg ~ " l>\[\[lNS'l' \[~l / edible L JA(:('ording t,, (13), to accept (1), one has toplace it; ill ;~ st)ecial conte.xt where edible key-bonrds exist (e.g.

Alternatively, one has to relax theB(~ constraint hat the keyboard 1111181; BC edi|)le.We assmne that special contexts ~dlow t)a.rticu -l~r BG constraints to be relaxed (this is how wewouht a(:(:omlt fin" the use of (1) ill ~L circus con-text), \])ut we (Io not ll;we any t'ornl~d lne(:hanisnlto sl)e(:itly exactly when B(~ (:(mstr;dnts ('~m l)erelnxcd.Similnr connnents apply to (3).

llot artifacts,while keyboards m:e. Systenls that employ se-lc(:tionnl restri(:tions usunlly encode knowledgeof this kind in the.
fol:nl of sort hierarchies ofworhl entii;ies.
A siml)listic exmnt)le of such nhierm:chy is det)i('ted ill tigure 1.
The hierarchyof tigure \] shows thnt nil lllell &lid techniciansare 1)ersons, all 1)ersons are ~tniln;~|;e entities, allaninlate entities are t)\]lysi(:al ol)je(:ts, mitt so on.Some (1)ut not all) persons are 1)oth teehni(:ians:rod lnen at the same time; these t)ersons arenmml)ers of I;he male_tech sort.
Similarly, alll)mlmms are edil)h; ;rod liot artifacts.
No personis e(lil)le, because the sorts person and edibleh~we no (:onnnon su|)sorts.It is, of course, extremely difficult to con-stru('t hierm'chies th~Lt include all the sorts ofworld entities.
Ill natural  bmguage systenls thattarget sl)ecifi(: and restricted olmfins, however,constructing such hier;~rchies is feasible, becausethe relevant entity sorts and the possible hi-erarchical reb~tions between them are limited.In naturM lmlguage database interfimes, tbr ex-ample, the relevant entity sorts and the rela-tions between theln nre often identilied dur-ing the, (tesing of the database, in the tbrmof entity-relatiolMli 1) diagrams.
We also notel;h;~t large-scah; smmmtic sort hierarchies are al-ready ill use ill artiticinl intelligence ~md natural17language gener~tion projects (tbr example, Cyc(Lenat, 1995) and KPML'S Upper Model (Bate-man, 1997)), and that the techniques that wediscuss in this paper are in principle compatiblewith these hierarchies.To decide whether or not a sentence violatesany selectional restrictions, we collect from theCONT and BO features of its sign ((13) in thecase of (1)) all the single-role qfpsoas for whichthere is a sort in the hierarchy with the samename.
(This rules out single-slot qt~)soas in-troduced by the CONTs of intransitive verbs.
)The decision can then be seen as a constraint-satisthction problem, with the collected qfpsoasacting as constraints.
(15) shows the constraintstbr (1), rewritten in a tbrm closer to predicatelogic.
HPSG indices (the boxed nmnbers) areused as variables.
(15) kcybd(~\]) A man(~) A edible(~\])Given two contstraints cl, c2 on the same vari-al)le, c~ subsumes c2 if the corresponding hier-archy sort of cl is an ancestor of that of c2 orif cl = c2.
c~ and c2 can be replaced by a newsingle constraint c, if cl and c2 subsume c, andthere is no other constraint d which is subsumedby cl,c2 and subsumes c. c and c' must be con-straints on the same variable as ct, c2, and musteach correspond to a sort of the hierarchy.
If theconstraints of a sentence can be turned in thisway into a tbrm where there is only one con-straint fbr each variable, then (and only then)the sentence violates no selectional restrictions.
(15), and cdil, ,'am ot be re-p\]aced by a single constraint, because keybd andedible have no common subsorts.
Hence, a se-lectional restriction is violated, which accountsfor the oddity of (1).
In contrast, in (2) theconstraints would be as in (16).
(16) banana(~) A man(m) A edible(~\])banana(~\]) and cdible(F~) can now be re-placed by banana(F~), because both subsumebanana(~\]), and no other constraint subsmnedby both banana(~\]) and cdible(~) subsulnesbanana(~).
This leads to (17) and the conch>sion that (2) does not violate aw selectionalrestrictions.
(17) banana(E\]) A man(D\])This constraint-satisfaction reasoning, how-ever, requires a set)arate inferencing componentthat would be pipe-lined after the parser to ruleout signs corresponding to sentences (or read-ings) that violate selectional restrictions.
In thenext section, we discuss an alternative approachthat allows hierarchies of world entities to berepresented using the existing HPSG framework,and to be exploited during parsing without anadditional inferencing component.3 I ndex  subsor tsHPSG has already a hierarchy of feature struc-ture sorts (Pollard and Sag, 1994).
This hierar-chy can be augmented to include a new partthat encodes intbrmation about the types ofentities that exist in the world.
This can beachieved by partitioning the ref HPSO sort (cur-rently, a leaf node of the hierarchy of featurestructures that contains all indices that referto world entities) into subsorts that correst)ondto entity types.
To encode the information offigure 1, rEf would have the snbsorts abstractand physical, physical would have the subsortsanimate, edible, inanimate, and so on.
Thatis, referential indices are partitioned into sorts,mid the indices of each sort can only be an-chored to world entities of the correspondingtype (e.g.
keybd indices can only be anchoredto keyboards).With tiffs arrangement, the lexical sign for"ate" becomes (18).
The Bo edible restrictionof (10) has been replaced by the restriction thatthe index of the object must be of sort edible.
(18) -PIION (at8)LCOVpS ( N~'CNL c?NTI \[I~aTEN I edibleeatSimilarly, the sign for "Tom" becomes (19) (cE(11)), and the sign for "keyboard" introduces ani ,dex of sort k vbd as shown in (9O) (cf.
(12)).

The first method has the advantagethat it requires no modification of the cmTentIIPSO feature structures.
It also lnzdntains Pol-lard and Sag's distinction bel;ween "literal" mid"non-literal" meaning (expressed t)y CeNT andI~ACKGI/OUN\]) respe, ctively), a distinction whi('his lflm'red in the second approach (e.g.
nothingin (18) shows th~lt requiring the obje('t to denotean edil)le entity is part of the non-literal mean-ing; of.
(10)).
Unlike the tirst method, however,the second apt)roach re(tuires no additional ta-ft;renting comtionent br determining when se-lecl;ional restrictions h~tve been violated.
Withsentences that contain several potentially aiil-lfiguous words or phrases, t;11(,, second apl)roat:his also more etlicienl;, ~ls it blocks signs thatviolalx', selectionnl testa'tel;ions during parsing.In the tirsl; aplm)ach, these signs remain un-detected uring parsing, and they may have amultiplicative ffect, h;ading to a large nmnberof parses, which then have to l)e checked individ-ually by the taft;renting component.
We havetimnd the se(:ond at)l)roach t)articularly usefulin the develolnnent of practical systems.There is a deet)er question here al)out theproper place to maintain the kind of intbrnla-lion encoded in selectional restrictions.
Theapplicabil ity of selectional restrictions is alwayscontext-dependent;  and for any selectional re-striction, we can ahnost always find a contextwhere it does not hold.
Our second methodabove effectively admits that we cromer developa general tmrlIosc solution to the problem ofmeaning interprel;ation, and that we have to at-cept that our systems alwws operate in specificcontexts.
By committing to a particular con-text of interpretation, we 'compile into' whatwas tradit ional ly thought of as literal meaning a19set of contextually-determined constraints, andthus enable these constraints to assist in theHPSG language analysis without requiring anadditional reasoning component.
We take theview here that this latter approach is very ap-propriate in the construction ofreal applicationswhich are, and are likely to be ibr the tbresee-able future, restricted to operating in limiteddomains.ReferencesJ.F.
