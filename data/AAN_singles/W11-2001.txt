Proceedings of the SIGDIAL 2011: the 12th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, page 1,Portland, Oregon, June 17-18, 2011. c?2011 Association for Computational LinguisticsStrategic ConversationAlex LascaridesSchool of InformaticsUniversity of EdinburghEdinburgh, EH8 9AB, Scotland, UKalex@inf.ed.ac.ukModels of conversation that rely on a robust notion of cooperation don't model dialogues wherethe agents' goals conflict; for instance, negotiation over restricted resources, courtroom cross ex-amination and political debate.
We aim to provide a framework in which both cooperative andnon-cooperative conversation can be analyzed.
We develop a logic that links the public com-mitments that agents make through their utterances to private attitudes---e.g., belief, desire andintention.
This logic incorporates a qualitative model of human action and decision making thatapproximates principles from game theory: e.g., choose actions that maximize expected utility.However, unlike classical game theory, our model supports reasoning about action even whenknowledge of one's own preferences and those of others is incomplete and/or changing as thedialogue proceeds---an essential feature of many conversations.
The logic validates decidableinferences from utterances to mental states during interpretation, and from mental states to dia-logue actions during language production.
In a context where the agents' preferences align wederive axioms of co-operativity that are treated as primitive in BDI logics for analyzing dialogue.Thus models of cooperative conversation are a special case in our framework.The research presented in this talk is joint work with Nicholas Asher.1
