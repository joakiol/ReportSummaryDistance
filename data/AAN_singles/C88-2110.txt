On The Semantic  Interpretat ion of Nomina lsJ ames  PUSTE JOVSKY Peter  G. ANICK.Department of Computer ScienceBrandeis UniversityWaltham, MA 0225~617-736-2709jamesp ~by'andcis @csnetAbst ractIn this paper wc examine a subset of polyscmous elements,the logical structure of nominals, and argue that mawcases of polysemy have well-defined calculi, which interactwith the grmnmar in predictable and determinate ways fordisambiguation.
These calculi constitute part of the lexicaiorganization of the grammar and contribute to the lexicalsemantics of a word.
The lexieal system of the grammaris distinct from the conceptual representation associatedwith a lcxieal item, where polysemy is less constrained bygrarmnar.
We propose a structured' semantic representa-tion, the Lexical Conceptual Paradigm (LCP) which groupsnouns into paradigmatic classes exhibiting like behavior.1.
In t roduct ionMuch of the work on polysemy has tended to con-fuse the nature of word meaning by labeling many differenttypes of ambiguity as the same phenomenon.
In the ex-treme case, every possible lexieai semantic distinction is acase of polysemy and must have its own conceptual repre-sentation.
In such a theory, various features are introducedto distinguish one sense from another~ but the meaningsm'e all part of the same homogeneous conceptual space.In this paper, we argue that there are various typesof polysemy, some more accessible to grammatical phenom-ena than others.
We use this as a principled istinguishingcharacteristic of polysemous types.
We distinguish two sys-tems that together comprise the meaning of lexieal items,the lexical system and the conceptual system.
In particu-lar, if there are certai n grammatical characteri,~tics that areaffected by a polysenmus relation between concepts, thenwe will say that this relation is overtly part of the lexical51BArtificial Intelligence Applications GroupDigital Equipment CorporationMarlboro, MA.

1 The mQor point to be argued here is that poly-semy is not a. single phenomenon operating over all lexicalitems with equM force and frequency.
Rather, Lhere aresubsystems in the lexicon which exhibit a restricted rangeof polysemous behavior.
Each subsystem is determinedby a representation called a Lexieal Conceptual Paradigm(LCP), which groups elements into classes with similar be-havior.
We limit ourselves in this paper to cases of poly-semy involving nominals.We will proceed as follows.
In Section Two weexamine the different types of polysemous nominals.
Inparticular, we look at a classification of relational nouns,paying particular attention to those exhibiting polysemousbehavior.
Then we examine the semantic interpretationspossible for artifactual nominals uch as book and record,and their associated polysemous behavior esulting fromcertain syntactic ontexts.
In Section Three we introducea framework ibr representing this information in the lex-icon.
We argue that certain semantic information asso-ciated with nomina~ is more priviliged and accessible tosyntactic selection than other knowledge associated withthe word.
We term these privileged properties the hidden-event roles of a nominal, and they form part of the LexicalSystem of semantic analysis.
All other information formspart of the more traditional notion of a conceptual space,what we term simply the Conceptual System.
Finally, inSection Foul" we look at the computational implications of1 We will discuss neither lexical ambiguity for verb~ trot holnonymy.
Our poinLhere is to narrow iwl on the finer sel~antic distinctions within a smaller set of lexica\]items.
For general discussion on iauues in lexical ambiguity, however, see /Boguraev1979/, \]Hit~t 1987/,/H~we~ 1977/, and/Wilks 1975\]'.
See/StMlard 1987/for arelatedapproach to polyaemy.2 As this group of nominals has been ~tudied extensively in the linguiBticliterature (cf.
for example, /Anderson 1979/, /Puatejovsky 1984/, /Willimm~ 1985/,/Saflr 1987/, /Moor$gat 1985/), we will diecuss it here only briefly,suc~h a lexic:d organization.
The distinction is an importantone for computational reasons.
First, it establishes clearcriteria for partitioning the semantic information associ-ated with a word; this will bear directly on the decisionsmade by a parser in order to disambiguate l xical itemsduring a parse.
Secondly, it affects the planning strategiesnecessm3r for lexicM selection in the process of languagegeneration.
Finally, it relates to the question of how toenter multiple word senses for a lexical item.
According tothis view, those words containing logical ambiguities carrythese sensc.,~ in the same entry.2.
The  l i te la t iona l  S t ructure  o f  Nomina lsOne reason to studythe semantics of relational nom-inals is that they exhibit polysemy in very well-defined andstructured ways.
For example, nominalizations such as ar-rival, destruction, and solution are ambiguons between theevent aorniltal reading and the resultative reading, as illus-trated in (1) through (3)Y(1) a.
We witnessed the city's destruction.
Eventb.
The destruction was widespread throughout thecity.
Resnltative(2) a. Mary's arriva !
is expected to be at 3:00 pm.Eventb.
Mary's arrival means that she gets the couch.Res~tltative(3) a. John's solution to the problem took 20 minutes.Eventb.
This solution is too difficult to understand.
Re-sultativeIt seems natural to ascribe the relational senses to nomi-nalizations ;~s being some projection of their related verbalargument si;ructure.
There axe many nominals, however,wh ich  are oot nominalizations, yet seem to refer to rela-tions in their meaning.
Classic examples include nounssuch as picture and story, a The difference is that theirrelational structures are implicit, while the relation in anomhtalization is explicit.Let us now turn to the class of dependent nomi-nals.
If the denotation of one sense of a lexical item is"depende:ct" on another, then that dependency is part ofthe semantic representation f that lexical item.
A famil-iar example is father or mother, where the relational nature'must be p~xt of the semmatics of the noun.
4 We term thesePrimitive relational nominals.
Perhaps not as familiar arenouns such as blemish, wart, scratch, cut, etc.
In each ofthesd cases, the object is evaluated with respect o anotherobject, and in fact it is hard to imagine the dependent ob-ject existing in isolation.
For this reason, these will becalled Primitive Figure-Ground nominals.
The object it-self is the figure to a necessary ground object.A related class of lexical items includes nouns suchas window and door.
These are not simply Primitive Figure-Ground nominals, for notice that there is a hidden argu-ment present hat relational nouns such as wart do nothave.
(4) a.
Plastic windows are on sale at Lechmere.b.
The cat crawled through the window.
(5) a. John painted the door blue.b.
John walked through the door quickly.As pointed out in \]Lakoff 1987/, as well as/Talmy 1975/,the nouns here are polysemous, since the window referredto can be the opening as well as the object.
Thus, the hidk.den argument mentioned is the open space that is left asa result of the absence of the window.
We term this argu-ment the inverted figure, and the noun class itself DoubleFigure-Ground Nominals.
5 In Section Three, it will bcshown that the polysemy illustrated in (4) and (5) is verydifferent from word senses not making reference to eitherthe figure or inverted figure.The next class of relational nominals are those whichenter into a specified relation; namely, the class of artifacts.An artifact is, by definition, an object associated with aparticular activity or event; for example, cigarettes are forsmoking, books are for reading, etc.
Because of these as-sociated activities, this class of nouns exhibit polysemousbehavior.
(6) a.
This record weighs an ounce.b.
This record lasts 35 minutes.
(7) a.
The book has a red cover.b.
This book will talCe a week (to read).
(8) a.
These cigarettes are longer thaal the normal size.b.
His cigarette is bothering me.3 See /Pustejovsky 1984/, /Safir 1987/, and /WilliamB 1985/ for further dis-cu6slon.4 /Partee and Kamp 1986/discusses the semantics of such nominals.5 Another type of dependent omilml is that seen with 'lock ~ and ~key'.
Theseobjects do exi.t independent of the ground object it is associated with through i tsfunction, but still allow selection for this dependency; for example, "key to the lock"and "10ck for the door".519The polysemy in (6) arises becmme of the possiblereference to the event of playing the record as well as therecord by itself.
Similarly, in (7) the book itself or the eventof reading the book can be referred to by the nominal.Finally, the difference in (8) points to the cigarette as anobject with attributes versus an object in the context ofbeing smoked.
~In this section we have presented five types of re-lational nominals (nominalizations, primitive relationals,primitive figure-grounds, double figure-grounds, and arti-factual nominals), showing how they exhibit subtle butproductive polysemous behavior.
In the next section, weoutline our approach to polysemy and preserit an explana-tion of these lexieal mnbiguities in terms of a richer semamtic representation.3.
The Theory  o f  Lex ica l  Organ izat ionUnlike many previous approaches to word meaning,we distinguish the logical lexieal semantics of a word fromits deeper, conceptual denotation.
t We term these theL-system and U-system, respectively.The L-system is the particuhu- organization thatthe lexicon assumes independently of the conceptualsystem.
Only semantic information tlmt is somehowreflected in the syntax is represented here.The C-system is the organization of the conceptsthemselves and not the language.
This is the struc-ture of the me~mings, and as such, would be rep-resented as a semantic network or radial categorystructures (Cf./Hayes 1977/,/Lakoff 1987/).l)br each of the nominal types described in the pre-vious sections, we give lexical representations which allowus to capture their polysemous behavior.
Consider firstthe Double Figure-Ground Nominals in (4) and (5).
Thelexical semantics of such nouns as window and door mustrefer t,o the three arguments mentioned by the implicit re-lation, the figure, ground, and inverted-figure.
Assuming afirst-order, partial-decomposition model of lexical seman-tics, as given in /Pustejovsky 1987/, the translations forthis class would be as follows:6 It should be pointed out here that these are not case~ of metonymy.
Inmetonymy, the ability of one referring expression to stand in for another object is veryuneonstrained~ and fails to conform to any strict 9ondiLiolm on flllblltitutioIl t unlike t|leea~ea mentioned above,520(10) doo,.

/Pustejovsky in '1,reparation~).
The important hixa5to note about this representation is that it predicates twodistinct ypes of information over two different but rein,tedarguments, x and y; inanely, that a door~ for example 4 isdefined in terms of both the concrete object whi(:h is arti-Net (the figure), and the space in the absence of this object(the inverted-figure).
Thus, differeiit matrix predicationswill foreground ifferent subexpressions in the semanticsibr the norm.
For example, in (Sa), the artifact reading isselected, picking out the figure, while in (5b) the inverted-figure is selected.
(5) a. John painted the door blue.b.
John walked through the doo'r quickly.We argue that these are the only two types of polysemy tbrthese nominals that are lexieally motivated, and that o~herapparent eases of polysemy are .simply inferences associ-ated with the conceptual representation f the object.
Thiscan be seen in sentence such as (1l), taken from /Lakoff1987/.
(11) a.
The window is rotting.
(Reference to the wood)b.
The kids broke the window.
(Ii.eibrenee to thepane)These are not reMly polysemous in our sense, since the ar-gument structure of the verb selecting the nominal doesnot specify how the noun is to be interpreted.
That is,although both readings elect for the ~u'tifact interpreta-tlon, only inferences in the conceptual system, and not thelexieal semantics, tells us that rotting is predic~ted of tlhewooden part of the window, sAnother importmlt aspect o the representations in(9) m~d (10) is the expression introduced by the operator~r.

-8--~;\/ie~tructure of ~he conceptual ~ya~em will permit such infvx'cnce~ in a nut-m,al wetv, depending on the eyatem'~ colamon~len~e model of physics ~xnd agaric0, gee,/Hobbs et al1986/for aL mlggeative ~pl)rot~eh to such i~auea.is go.through(w, y), a pointer to a particular lexical item, itsargumelg; structure, and its selectional properties.The richer representations i  (9) and (10) now pro-rides us ~vith a mechanism for capturing some interestingand subtle lexical distinctions in the artifact nominal class.For nouns such as record, book, and bulb, we assign the fol-lowing semantics: 9(12) record .=~ ~z3e\[arti/aet(x) ^ 7r(x, play(e,z))\].
1?
(13) book=c.
,\x3e\[artifact(x) A r(x, read(e,w, x))\].
(14) bulb ~ ~x3e\[arti/aet(z) A ~r(x,illuminate(e,z))\].By explicitly referencing the event that the object is asso-ciated wiLh we can solve several puzzles.
First, notice thatwhen the event readings of record and book are selected,they differ in their aspectual interpretations.
(15) a.
This record lasts 35 mimttes.b.
This book takes a week (to read).c.
*This record takes 35 minntes.d.
?This book lasts a week.This is certainly surprising if no reference is made to thetype of egent referenced by the object.
Within the calcu-lus of aspect outlined in/Pustejovsky 1987/, play(z) andread(x,y) fall into different event-types, activity and ac.-complishment, respectively, and license different emporalpredicates.
So, it is not surprising that lexical semantic in-formation is accessible to such processes in the grammar.Another interesting application of the notion of hid-den event (or h-event) comes from evaluative predicates.
11\])'or example, consider the differences between the (a) and(b) NPs below:(16) a. a vinyl record: ~P3x3e\[arti/aet(x) A vinyl(x) A~(~,playCe,~)) ^ P(z)\].b.
~ long record )tP3x3e\[arti/aet(x) A r~(x,play(e,x)) AIon.~(~) ^ P(x)\].
(17) a. an opaque bulb ~P3x3e\[arti/act(z) A opaque(z) h~r(x, illuminate(e, z)) A P(z)\].b.
~ bright bulb ~x3e\[arti/aet(~) ^ ~r(x, illuminate(e, x)) /~b,.igh~(e) ^  p(x)\].In (16b), long is a property that only the playing of therecord has, while in (17b), bright is a property that onlythe state of illumination for bulbs has (el.
/Jackendoff1983/for multiple senses of lexical items).
By adopting asemantics that makes reference to events, just as with nom-inalization:b 12we can begin to understand how to analyzeevaluative predicates.
Nmnely, in the cases above, we candistinguish the types of attribution as predication over anindividual variable, the artifact ((16a) and (17a)), or overan event variable, the hidden event ((165) and (175)).The structures given in (12)-(14) are all examplesof artifactual objects.
The general abstraction for theseindividuals is the concept of an object made for a particularuse:,\x3e\[arlifaet(x) A lr(x,~\[e,x\])\]where c~ is some predicate.
Such a structure we will term aLexical Conceptual Paradigm (LCP).
We view these nom-inals as exhibiting paradigmatic behavior (much like theinflectional endings for verb classes) for the following rea-son: a paradigm acts as both an abstraction, in that itdefines classes, as well as a structured object, with a clus-tering of different behaviors.
When an object is assignedto a particular paradigm, it assumes the set of behaviorscharacteristic of that entire class.
So it is with such ar-tifactual nominals.
There are many such subsystems inthe lexicon, each with their own internM consistency rep-resented by unique paradigms.
This idc~ is explored indetail in/Pustejovsky and Anick 1988/.4.
Computat iona l  Imp l i ca t ions  o f  Lex ica lOrgan izat ionIn this section we discuss the relevance and implica-tions of the above analysis of nominal semantics for com-putationM purposes.
We will first look at the effect thatricher semantic representations have on lexical selection inthe process of language generation.
Secondly, we outlinehow the problem of lexical disambiguation is facilitated bythe use of such lexical entries in the process of analysis.Imagine a linguistic generation system in the ser-vice of a fairly rich semantic knowledge base and planner.Lexieal selection can be defined as the mapping from such9 We follow /Davidson, 1980\] and the extensions in /Parsons, 1985/for ourrepresentation of an event variable for the verb.
See/Pustejovsky 1987/for discussion.10 Notice that the sense of 'play' here is the ergative reading and not the agen-t i re.11 /ParteeandKamp, 1986/ provide a raodel-theoretic nterpretation f evdu.ative a4jeetives, making use of pL'ototypc theory.
Our analysis, howeverp follows mareclosely that position taken in /tligginbotham 1986/.12 For a discussion of the event/resultative distinction in naminalizations, see/Pustejovsky 19~/and /Pustejovsky 1997/.521a knowledge base to a linguistic generation system.
Appro-priate word choice is, of course, a function of numerous fac-tors and considerations (/Ward 1988/, /Pustejovsky andNirenburg 1987/,/Danlos 1987/), but, in any case, the se-lection process makes sense only if the incoming semanticrepresentation provides for there to be a distinction thatis later reflected as a lexical distinction.Consider now an implicitly relational nominal suchas cigarette.
The lexical representation for such a noun isgiven as (18).
(18) ~iga~eue ~ ~Je\[~tffa~t(z) A ~(z, smok~(e, w, ~))\].One of the properties of such nominals is that they maydenote the situation or event that the object is embeddedwithin (in this way, it seems to stand in a metonymic rela-tion to the event).
Thus, if given an underlying semanticform such as that in (19), the generator could produce,anmng others, the linguistic forms shown in (20).
(19) 3e13e23z\[smoke(el,x) A cigarette(z) A bother(e2,el,john)\](20) a.
The cigarette's smoking bothered John.b.
The smoking of the cigarette bothered John.c.
The cigarette bothered John.The interesting thing to notice here is that (20c)makes use of the nominal without explicit mention of thepredicate smoke.
In general, such paraphrase classes asthat in (20) involve the hidden event associated with anobject.
Furthermore, such classes exist mainly for nomi-nals that are artifacts and have such lexical semantic rep-resentations.
A similar decision procedure is at work inthe examples in (21), this time in matrix object position.
(21) a. John enjoyed the cigarette.
(h-event = smoke)b. Mary enjoyed the book.
(h-event = read)c. Bill hated the movie.
(h-event = watch)For each nominal appearing as head in the object positionin these examples, there is an associated hidden event hatallows for the appropriate default presupposition for justwhat activity was enjoyed for each object.
Thus, it is clearhow the representation here provides for choice points inthe process of lexical selection.As an indication of how lexical disambiguation canbe facilitated with the richer nominal representations pre-sented here, consider the multiple uses of a polysemousnoun such as lisp, illustrated in (22).522(22) a. John is running lisp.b.
Mary has entered lisp.c.
John knows lisp well.d.
Mary is writing lisp.Now, it might be argued that these senses are all slightvariants of one central sense for the nominal, perhaps thatof lisp as a language.
Yet what we know about lisp thatmakes it different from another language, say FORTRAN,is that it is an environment as well as a language.
Wecan think of the preference rules in/Boguraev's 1979/lex-ical disambiguation system as being elements of strncturedpackets, where the above senses are all logically related inone lexical representation f lisp; that is, its Lexical Con.ceptual Paradigm.
These word senses compete as a groupwith other unrelated meanings.
Then, finer discrimina-tions are aclfieved by reference to the internal structure ofthe LCP for that word.
We explore such a technique in/Pustejovsky and Anick 1988/and compare our approachto/Hirst  1987/and other lexical disambiguation systems.5.
Conc lus ion  and  Future  ResearchIn this paper we have argued against he treatmentof polysemy as a relation between meanings in a homo-geneous concept space.
Rather, we argue, that tbr nom-inals at least, there are well-defined subsystems of logi-cally structured ambiguities arising from determinate andfinite sources.
We suggest that the incorporation of hiddenevents in the lexical entry of a nominal provides a handlefor linking to other grammatical systems uch as aspectmad thematic roles, as well as exposing the behavior ofother relationships, uch as figure-ground, which also havegrammatical reflexes.
The utility of such a representationin NLU systems is illustrated by the applications to suchtasks as lexical selection in naturM language generationas well as to word sense disambiguation tasks and appli-cations in machine translation.
For example~ we are ex-amining the subtle range of grammaticalizations i volvedin German nominalization patterns using an event-basedsemantics; i.e.
assessing the appropriateness of one nom-inal expression over another.
Finally, it is interesting tospeculate on what the relationship between LCP-theoryand acquisition and metaphor is.
