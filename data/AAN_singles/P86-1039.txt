FORUM ON MACHINE TRANSLAT IONWhat  Should Machine Translation Be?John S. WhiteSiemens Information SystemsLinguistics Research CenterPO Box 7247 University StationAustin, TX 78712MODERATOR STATEMENTAfter a considerable hiatus of interest and funding,machine translation has come in recent years to occupy a sig-nificant place in the discipline of natural anguage processing.It has also become one of the most visible representations ofnatural language processing to the outside world.
Machinetranslation systems are relatively unique with respect o theextent of the coverage they attempt, and, correspondingly,the size of the grammatical and lexicaI corpora involved.
Ad-ding to this the complexity introduced by multiple languagedirections into the same system design (and the enormousprocedural problems imposed by simultaneous developmentin several sites) gives some clue as to the optimism whichpresently exists for machine translation.It is obviously believed in many quarters that computerscience and linguistic science have become sufficient forproduction-environment machine translation.
Private sectorcompanies continue to introduce new MT systems to themarketplace worldwide, and many more are venturing intodevelopment and implementation.
The industrial interest,meanwhile, has been instrumental in opening up possibilitiesfor doing basic research in it, in part because of direct inter-action between industry and research, and in part because ofthe overall increased awareness.
It is indeed worth speculat-ing whether renewed interest shown by governmental scien-tific agencies is related to the level of commercial acceptance.But some feel that this visibility causes more harm thangood.
The concern has been expressed that an operationalfailure in machine translation will be seen as a failure innatural language processing enerally, that a particular im-plementation rejected by users could cause a snowball ul-timately resulting in the demise not just of MT as in the AL-PAC aftermath, but also of all of computational linguistics.Some may go so far as to suggest hat such a day ofreckoning will be inevitable as long as production-levelmachine translation efforts continue.If it is indeed the case that production machine trans-lation is not feasible, then machine translation is at best aheuristic environment for experimentation in linguistictheory.
And machine translation does serve such an end ad-mirably well: the modularity of program and linguisticdescription of which a well-designed translation system iscapable allows work on hypotheses within one linguistictheory, or evaluation of different linguistic theories, withoutfundamental changes to the computing environment.Two positions are identified here, whose distance fromeach other serves perhaps to encompass the whole range ofthought on the ultimate potential of machine translation, aswell as on the best possible design of a translating device.The one position holds that MT is a viable production toolwhose benefit is more than worth the immense effort in-volved in linguistic description, textual coverage, and coor-dination of multi-national development.
The other positionholds that MT is a useful laboratory for linguistic study in asmall, easily maintainable computing environment.Despite the polarity, there is a common ground, which weemploy as the datum point from which to explore the issuesin machine translation today.
We have progressed from thedebate about the possibility of machine translation to thedebate about what machine translation should be.
This initself is indicative of our awareness of the progress of com-putational linguistics as a whole.267
