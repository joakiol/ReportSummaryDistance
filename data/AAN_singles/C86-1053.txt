Conceptual Lexicon Using an Object-Oriented LanguageShoiehi YOKOYAMA Kenji  HANAKATAElectrotechnical  Laboratory Univers i tat  StuttgartTsukuba ,  Ibarak i ,  Japan Stuttgart,  F. R. GermanyAbstractThis paper descr ibes the construct ion ofa lexicon represent ing abstract concepts.This lexicon is written by anobject -or iented language, CTALK, and forms adynamic network system control led byobject -or iented mechanisms.
The content ofthe lexicon is constructed using a Japanesedictionary.
First, entry words and theirdef in it ion parts are derived from thedictionary.
Second, syntact ic and semanticinformation is analyzed from these parts.Finally, superconcepts  are assigned in thesuperconcept part in an object, stat ic partsto the slot values, and dynamic operat ionsto the message parts, respectively.
One wordhas one object in a world, but through thesuperconcept part and slot part thisconnects to the subconcept of other wordsand worlds.
When relat ive concepts areaccumulated, the result will be a model ofhuman thoughts which have conscious andunconscious parts.1 .
Introduct ionSemantic relat ions among words orconcepts have been represented as aslot fi l ler def in i t ion in the lexicon\[Bobrow 77\].
These relat ions are usual lyrepresented as frame lists in LISP orProlog.
When the representat ion of alarge-scale lexicon is needed, it isdi f f icult  to make and maintain the lexiconbecause the relat ion of super /subconceptsdramat ica l ly  increases.An object -or iented language has a stronginference mechanism.
It has already beenused for parsing sentences \[Hayes 84,Nishida 84\].
It can also descr ibe therepresentat ion of semantic relat ions moresimply than LISP.
CTALK is such anobject -or iented language and can dynamical lyhandle the network using the concept of aworld a group of objects -- and anobject.Now the systemat izat ion of semanticrelat ions is made for the words whichrepresent concrete objects.
However, theorganizat ion of abstract words is d i f f icultbecause it is not so clear how to obtain anddeal with abstract concepts.
On the otherhand, research is being conducted tocomputer ize or categor ize the commondict ionary \[Yokoyama 77, Tsurumaru 84\].This paper  descr ibes a trial ofsystemat izat ion and categor izat ion ofabstract words.
The procedure is as follows:first, the def in i t ion parts of abstractwords in the dict ionary are semant ica l lyanalyzed, and the semantic relat ions arederived.
Second, an object is establ ishedfor an abstract word.
Third, thesuper/subeoncepts  of these words areassigned to a father-son relat ion among theobjects corresponding to the semanticnetwork.
Then the slot def in i t ions areassigned to the object.
From these slotvalues, new objects are made under therelat ive objects.
Finally, the network isconstructed from these abstract words.The  network formed by this method isconsidered to be a model of humanconsciousness.
That is, when a human isreminded of a concept, other conceptsrelat ive to it are s imul taneous ly  extractedfrom the memory and stay beneath the mainmemory.
This approach is considered to be animplementat ion of interact ive act ivat ionmodel \[Rumelhart 82\] in abstract  conceptl eve l .2.Ob ject -o r iented  language CTALKThe ob jec t  o r iented  language,  CTALK, wasdeveloped at Univers i tat  Stuttgart  \[Hanakata84\].
In this section, a s imple summary ofCTALK is described.The main elements of CTALK are worlds andobjects.
A world is a set of objects, andsome active worlds stay in the main memory.When the number of worlds exceeds theconstant def ined by the system, the leastrecent worlds are gradual ly  swapped into thesecondary memory.
The hierarchy or thenetwork among the objects, that is, thefather son  relat ion of the objects is s implyset to every object, independent of thewor ld  s t ruc ture .An object consists of four parts, SUPERC,SONS, SLOTS, and METHODS.
SUPERC means thesuperconcepts,  that is, the fathers of theobject.
SONS, l iterally, means the sons ofthe object.
Actually, in the input of theobject, the names of sons are not speci f iedexplicit ly.
The control of these father-sonrelat ions are performed on the bit table.The use of this bit table enables the fastoperat ion of creat ing and removing theserelations, and also of treating inher i tancemechanisms.
The inher i tance usual ly worksinside a world, and can also be spread toother worlds.
The direct ion of inher i tancecan be speci f ied by VIEWED AS operator\[Selbmann 85\], with which an object inheritsthe features of specif ied father(s).SLOTS is a stat ic property of an object.The form of SLOTS is as follows:\[slotname (restr ict ion) : default-value\]\[slotname slot-value\]The restr ict ion and default  value areoptional, and slot value must fill therestr ict ion in the same slotname in theantecedent object.
If a conf l ict  occurs atvalue assignment, no value can be assignedwhen the restr ict ion is violated.
When therei s  no restr ict ion or the restr ict ion isfil led, another defaul t -va lue can beassigned in a descendant object.METHODS is the message part of theobject.
Sending the message invokes theoperat ion written in the METHODS part.
Ofcourse ,  logical funct ions such as ~if ?
,226" then" ,  and "e l se" ,  and numerical  funct ionssuch as "equal", "greq" (greater than orequal) can be written in the METHODS part.User functions can be def ined using systemfunctions and other user functions.3 .Construct ion of the conceptual  network3.1 .P rocedureThe procedure to make the conceptualnetwork is as follows:I.
The def init ion part for an abstractword is derived from the corresponding entryword in a dict ionary \[Kindaichi 74\], andsemant ica l ly  analyzed.2.
A new world is made for an entry word.3.
The top  level object named TOP ismade.
This is the control object for messagepassing and slot handling.
The father objectof TOP is now CTALK_ IN_CTALK (defaulthighest object in the whole world).
Allobjects in the same world are the sons ofTOP.4.
An object corresponding to the entryword is made as a son of TOP.5.
If the evident superconcept  isderived, it is expl ic i t ly  written in SUPERCpart.
In the case of an isa relat ion (achange to another word), the slot value"isa" is f i l led for the corresponding word.6.
Objects of the words written in thedef init ion part of the entry words are madein the world of the entry word.
Theseobjects have an object with the same name asthe father object in another world, that is,a superconcept.7.
The arc relat ions relat ive to the sonobject are assigned to the slot name, andthe slot value is the corresponding word atthe other side of the arc.Finally, one world is formed for oneentry word as a "lump" of the concepts.
Inthe fol lowing sections, the detai ls  of thisprocedure is described.3.2.Making the objectsFig.l (a) shows the top-level object TOPin the world "mokuteki" (object or aim).
Itssuperconcept  is now CTALK_IN CTALK, but iftwo or more conceptual  words can be sublated("aufheben?
), the integrated concept becomesa new superconcept.
The sons are the entryword itself and the objects (words) whichare derived from the def in i t ion part of theentry word.
These form the components in thesemantic network.
In the slot "mean", theliteral meaning cited from the dict ionary iswritten, and used as a normal search (i.e.consultat ion)  of the dictionary.
In order toconsult the dictionary, the fol lowingmessage should be sent to CTALK IN CTALK:(CTALK mean mokuteki\].The operat ion written in  METHODS part inCTALK.
.
IN_  CTALK:\[mean ?x -> (* do: (x chw:)(TOP gv: mean))\]is invoked.
The variable x is connected to"mokutek i " ,  and the l iteral meaning isoutput.
"* do:" is a PROGN-I ike funct ion inLISP, and the return value is the evaluat ionof the last part of the fo l lowing functions.
"Chw:" is a system function changing aworld, and "gv:" takes a slot-value.TOP IN mokutekiSUPERC\[ C'rALK IN CTALK )SONS\[ koto IN mokuteki \]\[ mono_IN mokuteki \]\[ mokuteki IN mokuteki 1s s'( mean "kodosuru mokuhyotosite kangaerarelasositai nanigotoka, sonaritai nanimonoka" )/* something considered as m behavioral aim */METHODSFig.

Many of theentry words in the d ict ionary are explainedas the subcategory of "mono" or "koto" ,"Mono" represents a concrete thing or objectin many cases, but also represents theabstract things in some cases like in"mokuteki " .
On the other hand, " koto"represents abstract things or matters inalmost a\].l cases.
According to thedict ionary, both ~mono" and ?koto" areassigned as SUPERC's here, but it could bepossible to make only ?koto" a SUPERC.
Forthe problems concerning the def in i t ion powerof the dict ionary, see Conclusion.
The entryobject can be connected to its relat ivewords as SUPERC relations.
In SONS part, thewords referr ing to "mokuteki" are described,Here the \] .
ink from ~mokuteki" iN_'syusi"(purpose) and "mokut eki " ...IN _" meate" (guideor aim) is connected.
The more complex thesemantic network is, the greater the numberof SONS objects is.
In SLOTS part, there isno slot name nor va\].ue because no ~isa"relat ion exists in the def in i t ion part inthe dictionary.Fig.l (c shows a part of objects whichshould be made on the world "mokuteki'.
"Koto ?
is one of the superconeepts  of~mokuteki ?
and by itself  a subconcept of"TOP ~ and "koto._IN_koto ?
.
3 slot names are227assigned at SLOTS part, that is JBO, OR, andYNA.
The strange names such as JBO and YNAindicate the reverse direct ion of arcs.
Thisguarantees the two way relation of objects.Slot value is, of course, the correspondingword name.
In the case of "kodo" (behavior)the structure is similar to "koto".3.3.World "mokuteki"F ig.2 shows a part of a conceptualdiagram for the world ?mokuteki ?

--:>indicates the arc from father objects inother worlds, --> the arc to son objects inother worlds, and --~ the connect ion insidethe world.
When new terms or examplesentences for the word are added to thisworld, the structure inside the world willchange.
On the other hand, when new entrywords are added to the system, the number ofworlds increases.
If these words arerelat ive to the world ?mokuteki" or refer toit, connect ion arcs are newly formed, andthe network becomes more complex.CTALK IN CTALKl\ \ I ~isi IN isiTOP -/ :, <o o"~mokutek i~"  is i // mokuteki 11 \\ ./Fig.

That concept corresponds to a worldin this system.
Relat ive concepts areconnected to this concept and exist near (orbeneath) the main concept.
Some of theseconcepts often go to the surface ofconsciousness,  but usual ly stay beneath theconsciousness.
These concepts correspond toother worlds connected to this world.In the current system, relat ively stat icpropert ies are defined, and only a fewdynamic connect ions are used.

SLOTS par t  shou ld  becons idered  in  the  next  vers ion .I f  a s imi la r  s t ruc ture  i s  found betweentwo or more worlds, integration of theseworlds can be considered.
On the other hand,when one world is too big to be treated, theseparat ion of the world would occur.Separat ion and integrat ion processes ofworlds are also considered as a model ofhuman thinking.
However, the automat izat ionof the process is very difficult.Knowledge for the world is now derivedfrom a Japanese dictionary.
One reason forusing the dict ionary is that it is di f f icultto deal with the words having abstractconcepts, and the dict ionary is one of the228most convenient clues for treatment.
Theother reason is that this dict ionary hasbeen computer ized \[Yokoyama 77\] and will beused for automatic semantic analysis.However, def in i t ions of entry words in adict ionary have various problems such asdefinit ion, semantic elements, andco reference \[Nakano 85\].
Descr ipt ion ofother d ict ionar ies should be discussed, andthe efforts to find suitable representat ionand connect ion will be continued.AcknowledgementsThis research started at  Univers i tatStuttgart  when Yokoyama stayed there as avis it ing researcher sent by the JapaneseGovernment.
