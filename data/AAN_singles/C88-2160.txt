Interact ive Translat ion : a new approachRtmi ZAJACGETA, UJF-CNRS, Domaine Universitaire,38041 Saint Martin d'Hdres cedex 53X FRANCEATR Interpreting Telephony Research LaboratoriesTwin 21, MID Tower, 2-1-61 Shiromi, Higashi-ku,Osaka 540, JAPANAbstractA new approach for Interactive Machine Translation where the authorinteracts during the creation or the modification of the document isproposed.
The explanation of an ambiguity or an error for thepurposes of correction does not use any concepts of the underlyinglinguistic theory : it is a reformulation of the erroneous or ambiguoussentence.
The interaction is limited to the analysis step of thetranslation process.This paper presents a new interactive disambiguation scheme basedon the paraphrasing of a parser's multiple output.
Some examples ofparaphrasing ambiguous sentences are presented.Key-wordsMachine Translation, Interactive Translation, Intelligent WordProcessor.A.
THE PROBLEMGoalsThe main goal here is to resolve correctly ambiguities arising innatural anguage analysis in every case.
To date, this cannot beaecomplisheA by any existing automatic MT system.
The problemremains choosing asentence structure that most accurately reflects theauthor's intended message and it therefore remains an unsolved andyet important problem.Classical machine translation systems use heuristics based onstatistical regularities in the use of language.
Interactive systems askquestions directed at a specialist of the system (like rFS of BYU\[Melby & alii 80\]) and/or a specialist of the domain (like the TITUSsystem of Institut Textile de France \[Ducrot 82\]).
There, tileinteraction is done purely at the syntactic level, as a syntax directededitor for a programming language is used by a specialist of both thesystem and the language 1.Models or projects using extralinguistic knowledge will not be ableto solve ambiguities inevery case: a document isgenerally supposedto provide some piece of new information that may not be coded inthe knowledge base.The use of learning procedures i at present not effective.None of these approaches can resolve ambiguities correctly inevery case.
The problem is basically amatter of interpretation: onlythe author of the document himself can tell what he intended to say.Nevertheless, heis not supposed to have any knowledge of the target!language and therefore, he should not be involved uring the transferphase 2.In the case of interaction with the author, two problems arise:' 1.
The author is supposed to write his document and not to solveweird linguistic problems.~2.
In all interactive systems, the system asks a specialist questionsbased on knowledge of the underlying linguistic theory.
Forinteracting wiUa the author, this approach is to be rejected: seeexamples of interaction with ITS \[Melby & alii 80\] or even Tomita'ssystem \[Tomita 84\].785A proposalTo solve these problems, we propose :- to integrate the interactive system as one function of a wordprocessor, the interaction being initiated by the author;- to explain an ambiguity presenting a set of paraphrases generatedfrom the set of parse trees of the ambiguous sentence;- to explain an error (of spelling and of grammar) by presenting a"reasonable" correction and a comment of the error.
This point willnot be treated in this paper.
See for example \[Jensen & Heidorn 83,Zajac 86b\].Discuss ionThe integration i  a word processor allows the use of a "controlledlanguage" where checking and correction isdone during the creationor modification of a document.
This can be viewed as an extension ofthe capabilities of a simple spellchecker, in the form a toolbox oflinguistic aids for the author, checking the spelling, the terminology,the grammar and the style.
For the translation of technical material,the use of a normative grammar, imposing precise limitations onterminology and syntax, will entail more clarity and concision inexpression, as argued by \[Elliston 79\] and \[Ruffino 82\], and willoffer a convenient tool for normalizing a documentation.In the cases where a correct interpretation uses domain knowledgeinteractively, it will be possible to make a clear cut between the purelinguistic knowledge, to be coded in the analyser, and theextralinguistic knowledge (semantics of the domain).
As a matter offact, it is not always justified to integrate in the grammar specificsemantic ategories, as in the METEO system for example.
Thisseparation will allow us to enlarge the domain of applicability of amachine translation system, that could be, for example, extended to apersonal translation system \[Tomita 84\], and this could be interestingwhen no translation service is available or if the quantity oftranslation does not justify using the services of a translator \[Kay82\].GETA \[Vauquois 78\].
There are four main levels of linguisticinterpretation:1. categories : morphosyntactic categories (gender, number, class ofverb,...), semantic ategories (abstract, concrete,...), actualisationcategories (perfective, imperfective,...), syntactic ategories (noun,verb, valencies,...) and syntactic lasses (sentence, verb phrase,...).2. syntactic functions : subject, objectl, object2, attribute of thesubject, attribute of the object, complement of noun or adjective,detemainer, circumstancial complement ....3. logical relations : predicate-argument relations.4.
semantic relations : causality, consequence, qualifier, qualified ....The geometry of the tree corresponds to a phrase structure : thelabels of inner nodes are syntactic lasses, the labels of leaves arelexical units.
Additional information iscoded in the attributes of eachnode.The morphological, syntactic and semantic ategories are computedby a morphological nalyser written in ATEF.
The output of themorphological nalyser will be the input of a structural analyserproducing multiple outputs in ambiguous cases.Architecture of the interactive translation systemA classical machine translation process in the ARIANE system\[Boitet & alii 82, 85\] uses a morphological nalysis phase (MA) andan automatic structural analysis phase (SA, on the left of the figure).This phase is replaced with an interactive phase (in the middle).Disambiguation a d correction dialogues make calls to paraphrasingand correcting modules.
The remainder of the process uses classicalautomatic transfer steps (LT and ST) and generation steps (SG andMG).
On the figure, the existing modules are in bold outline,modules where there exists only a model are in normal outline,specified modules are shaded grey).B.

J Iparaphrasing modulesdescriptorof thetarget textROBRAi1Strategy for interactive disambiguisationThe approach we propose is not to produce explanations usinglinguistic oncepts of the linguistic model (as it has been done up tonow, see \[Melby & alii 80, Tomita 84\]), but to produce paraphrasesthat make explicit he ambiguous relations.Lexical ambiguities are quite trivial to solve by presenting thedefinitions from a dictionary.
In this paper, they are supposed to bealready solved.
Structural ambiguities are treated after a completeparse.
In a practical setting, the best strategy would probably be toproduce a complete parse, to solve lexical ambiguities and then tosolve structural ambiguities for the remaining parses.We propose, for some types of ambiguities that can arise,paraphrastk; transformations that make ambiguous relations explicit.paraphrasing step, the generation being for the same language as thesource language.
The process is illustrated below.

Then, eachparaphrased tree will be sent to a generator to produce thecorresponding string.
The whole process is very similar to a secondgeneration translation process, the transfer step being replaced by aC.
SOME EXAMPLES OF PARAPHRASTICTRANSFORMATIONS1.
Scope of coordination.
The nominal phrase "perturbations inthe atmosphere and radiation" may have two interpretations a shownbelow.787NPperturbations N PIn the atmosphere NlPsf=coordIand radiationNPperturbations N P N sf=coordIIn the atmosphere and radiationPresenting the phrase structure as parenthetized structure, we mayhave :1.
(perturbations (in the atmosphere (and radiation)))2.
(perturbations (the atmosphere) (and radiation))This kind of presentation (or a similar projective scheme) is used inthe DLT project of BSO (personal communication, 1987) and in\[Tomita 84\].
A conjunction of coordination van be used to "factorize"a phrase.
The explanation of the scope of the coordination will be the"developement" and the permutation of the factorized terms.
Thepresentation using the paraphrasing scheme would be as follows :> pertubations in the atmosphere and radiation1.
perturbations in the radiation and perturbations in the atmosphere2.
radiation and perturbations in the atmosphere2.
AP as NP complement or VP complement: "Le magistratjuge les enfants coupables"PHVBGN jugs GNle maglstrat lee enfants GA sf:epltcoupables788PHVBGN Jugs GN GAIs maglstrat los enfents coupablesUsing explicit paraphrasing of the determination with a relativepronoun, we may have :> le magistrat juge les enfants coupables1.
le magistrat juge les enfants qui sent coupables(the magistrate judges the children who are guilty)2. le magistrat jnge que les enfant sent coupables.
(the magistrate judges that the children are guilty)3.
Subject and object.
The sentence "Which author quotes thislecturer ?"
may have two interpretations, f is the syntactic functionwhose value may be the subject (subj) or the first object (objl) ofthe governor of the sentence, "quotes".
There is also an ambiguitywith the argument place (argO, argl) for logical relations (It).
Inthis case, we may present the structures normalizing the sentence toactive declarative form.
Note that the phrase structures in thisexample are identical.Ssf:ob\]l N P quotes  N Psf:subJr lr=argl I I lr=argOwhich author the lecturerSsf=subJ NP quotes NPsf:objlIr=argO I I ,rf.rgrwhich author the lecturer> Which author quotes this lecturer ?1.
the lecturer quotes the author2, the author quotes the lecturer4.
A well known example.
The sentence "Mary sees a man inthe park with a telescope" may have six different interpretations abelow.SI I I IMary a man In the park with a telescopeSNPMary a man In the park Iiwith a telescopeSNP NP NPMary a man NP with a telescopeIn the parkSNP sees NPNP Mary a man }IIn the parkNPIwith a telescopeSNP sees NPMary a man N PIn the park N PIwith a telescopeFor paraphrasing, we have to move circumstancials head aud if thereis more than one, to coordinate them.
We have also to make nounphrase determinations explicit by using relative pronouns and, ifthere is more than one determination for the same noun phrase, wecoordinate them.
We should have then :> Mary sees a man in the park with a telescope1.
with a telescope, in the park, Mary sees a man2.
in the park which has a telescope, Mary sees a man3.
with a telescope, Mary sees a man who is in the park4.
Mary sees a man who has a telescope and who is in the park5.
Mary sees a man who is in the park which has a telescopeConclus ionWe have presented a new approach for interactive translation basedon the paraphrasing of ambiguous entences.
Compared to others\[Ducrot 82, Melby & alii 80, Tomita 84\], this proposal makes a stepforward to the user level of understanding, transfering part of theburden of interaction from the man to the machine : no speciallinguistic knowledge is required but the simple (!)
everydaycompetence of the user of language.
This could be realized using onlylinguistic paraphrastic transformations on the output of the parser.Some simple examples have been presented using quite simpletransformations : in the case of ambiguous PP attachment there aretwo possibilities : (1) the PP modifies a noun phrase and this couldbe made explicit by using a relative pronoun; (2) the PP modifies thesentence and it can be moved ahead of it.A set of paraphrastic transformations is now being developed to beable to write a transformational grammar that will allow experimentson a corpus.Notes1.
In the case of technical documents, the operator (linguist,translator r documentalis0 may not have enough knowledge to solvesome question.
For example, in the sentence "the experiment requirescarbon and nitrogen tetraoxyde" \[Gerber & Boitet 85\], the scope of"and" is ambiguous and we may read either "carbon tetraoxyde andnitrogen tetraoxyde" or "nitrogen tetraoxyde and carbon".
To be ableto choose correctly, we have to know that carbon tetraoxyde does notexist in ordinary chemistry.
But again, this conclusion could be falsein a very special s6tting, e.g.
an experiment described by the text inwhich carbon tetraoxyde is being produced as an (unstable)intermediate product of th reaction!2.
It may be possible to organise the interaction simply by presentingthe set of definitions of the transfer dictionary for each unit having7~9several equivalent in the target language, and ask tim author to chooseone of them.References\[Boitet & alii 80\] BOITET C., GUILLAUME P., QUEZEL-AMBRUNAZ M., Manipulation d'arborescences tparalldlisme: lesystdme ROBRA , COLING-80.\[Boitet & alii 82\] BOITET C., GUILLAUME P., QUEZEL-AMBRUNAZ M., ARIANE-78: an integrated environment forautomated translation and human revision, COLING-82.\[Boitet & alii 85\] BOITET C., GUILLAUME P., QUEZEL-AMBRUNAZ M., A case study in software evolution : fromARIANE 78.4 to ARIANE 85, COLGATE-85.\[Carbonell & Tomita 85\] CARBONELL J.G., TOMITA M., Newapproaches to machine translation, COLGATE-85.\[Ducrot 82\] DUCROT J.M., TITUS IV, in Taylor P.J., Cronin B.
