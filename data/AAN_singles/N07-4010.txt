OMS-J is designedto provide an intuitive visual GUI of opin-ion mining graphs for a comparison ofdifferent products of the same type tohelp a user make a quick purchase de-cision.
We first use an opinion miningmethod using a combination of supervised(a Naive Bayes Classifier) and unsuper-vised (an improved SO-PMI: SemanticOrientation Using Pointwise Mutual In-formation) learning.1 IntroductionNowadays, there are numerous Web sites containingpersonal opinions, e.g.
customer reviews of prod-ucts, forums, discussion groups, and blogs.
Here,we use the term Weblog for these sites.
How to ex-tract and analyze these opinions automatically, i.e.
?Opinion Mining?, has seen increasing attention inrecent years.This paper presents a simple opinion mining sys-tem (OMS-J) for analyzing Japanese Weblog re-views automatically.
The novelty of OMS-J is two-fold: First, it provides a GUI using intuitive visualmining graphs aimed at inexperienced users whowant to check opinions on the Weblog before pur-chasing something.
These graphs can help the userto make a quick decision on which product is suit-able.
Secondly, this system combines a supervisedand an unsupervised approach to perform opinionmining.
In related work (Chaovalit, 2005; Tur-ney, 2002), both supervised and unsupervised ap-proaches have been shown to have their pros andcons.
Based on the merits of these approaches andthe characteristics of Japanese (Kobayashi, 2003),we proposed an opinion mining method using aNaive Bayes Classifier (supervised approach) and animproved SO-PMI method (unsupervised approach)to perform different parts of the classification task(Wang, 2006).OMS-J implements Weblog opinion mining bythe steps shown in Figure 1.
In the next section, wedescribe the proposed system in detail.1.

We used theGoogle search engine1 to get al the information onone product category or one specific product in theJapanese weblog on the Internet.
The search key-word is the product category name or the productname.
The URL range of the search is restricted bythe URL type (e.g.
blog, bbs, review).2.2 Weblog Content ExtractionThe Content Extraction step first analyzes the We-blog content using a dependency structure analyzerfor Japanese, Cabocha2.
Based on the syntacticcharacteristics of Japanese reviews and the results1http://www.google.co.jp/2http://www.chasen.org/?taku/software/cabocha/19of related work (Kobayashi, 2003; Taku, 2002), wedesigned the following templates to extract opinionphrases:< noun + auxiliary word + adj / verb / noun >< adj + noun / undefined / verb >< noun + verb >< noun + symbol + adj / verb / noun >Except the above < adj >2.3 Opinion MiningOpinion mining methods can usually be divided intotwo types: supervised and unsupervised approaches.Supervised approaches are likely to provide moreaccurate classification results but need a training cor-pus.
Unsupervised approaches on the other hand re-quire no training data but tend to produce weakerresults.We propose a combined opinion mining methodby performing feature classification and P/N classi-fication (Wang, 2006).
The purpose of these classifi-cations is to know what the opinion expresses abouta certain product?s features.
Feature means a prod-uct?s attribute, i.e.
price, design, function or batteryfeature.
Based on our previous study, it is easy tocreate a feature corpus.
Therefore feature classifica-tion is performed by a supervised approach, a NaiveBayes Classifier.
P/N classification classifies repu-tation expressions into positive or negative meaningusing an unsupervised approach, SO-PMI.
The SO-PMI approach measures the similarity of pairs ofwords or phrases based on the mutual informationtheory, in our case the closeness of an opinion andwords for ?good?
or ?bad?.No human effort is required when mining a newproduct or category.
Only inputting the name of theproduct or category is needed.
It does however re-quire quite a lot of processing time, since the SO-PMI approach using a search engine is very timeconsuming.
Adding new features requires manualwork, since a small hand labeled training corpus isused.
Similar categories of products, for instancecameras and mp3 players, use the same featuresthough, so this is not done very often.2.4 Mining Graphs GUIFinally, OMS-J provides a GUI with mining graphsshowing the opinion mining data in the database, asshown in Figure 2.
These graphs show the distribu-tion of positive and negative opinions of each featuretype such as ?design?, and for each product.
Thedistribution of positive opinions among the differentproduct choices are shown in a pie chart, as is thesame for negative opinions.
This GUI can also showgraphs for a single product?s mining results, show-ing the positive/negative opinion distribution of eachfeature.Figure 2: OMS-J?s GUI Screenshot for One Product Category3 DemonstrationDuring the demonstration, we will show that OMS-J is an intuitive opinion mining system that can helppeople to make a quick decision on purchasing someproduct.
OMS-J?s trial version has been developedand tested with three kinds of products: ElectronicDictionaries, MP3 Players and Notebook PCs.
Theexperiment results were positive.
We will show howthe system works when a user wants to buy a goodMP3 player or wants to get a feel for the generalopinions on a specific Notebook PC etc.ReferencesPimwadee Chaovalit and Lina Zhou.
