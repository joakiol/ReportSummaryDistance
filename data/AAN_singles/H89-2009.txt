Box 517, Paoli PA  19301ABSTRACTThis paper describes issues in adapting the PUNDIT  system, designed originally for message processing,to a query-answering system for the VOYAGER application.
The resulting system, whose architecture andcapabilities are described here, represents a first step towards our goal of demonstrating spoken languageunderstanding in an interactive problem-solving context.INTRODUCTIONThe application which we describe in this paper is a natural anguage interface to VOYAGER, an expertsystem which provides navigational ssistance for the area between MIT and Harvard 1.
The applicationis well-suited to exploring the role of natural anguage understanding in an interactive problem-solvingcontext: the expert system knows enough about its domain to allow extended problem-solving dialogue,e.g.
for a user to find a hotel near MIT, find a nearby Italian restaurant, and get directions from the hotelto the restaurant (see below).Our ultimate goal is to process spoken input, and indeed, dialogue is, to use the terms of \[Bib88\], astereotypically oral genre.
A reasonable strategy for incrementally arriving at this goal is to begin withtyped input.
This approach allows us to explore general issues in handling dialogue, and further allowsus to look at ways in which characteristics of the genre, aspects of the task, the informational structureof the utterance and the discourse context can all be used to limit the search space for spoken languagerecognition.The following dialogue illustrates a typical problem-solving session with VOYAGER (note: utterances la-belled 'VFE' are contributed by the VOYAGER front-end, discussed shortly).User :  I s  there  a hote l  near  MIT?VFE : I ' l l  ask  Voyager .

)MESSAGE PROCESSING AND QUEST ION-ANSWERINGThe PUNDIT  natural language processing system was initially developed in the context of message-processingapplications.
Because PUNDIT  is a modular system, typical potting tasks include the creation of a domain-specific lexicon, knowledge base, and semantics rules.
Another common feature is basic extensions tohandle constructions which are part of the standard written language, but which have not previouslyappeared in the data (e.g.
comparatives, superlatives, address expressions).
More interesting are theextensions occasioned by basic differences between messages and face-to-(inter)face conversational inter-action.Basic Differences Between Messages and Voyager DialogueTo fully characterize these differences requires representative data from naturally-occurring messages andtask-oriented dialogue.
We have the former; it is our plan to collect the latter, possibly using PUNDIT +VOYAGER as a data collection vehicle.
For present purposes, we may highlight some of the observed if-ferences and similarities.
Our message corpora consist largely of short narratives in what has been calledtelegraphic style (cf.
\[GK86\]).
As a consequence, we find frequent agentless passives, noun-noun com-pounds, nominalizations, run-on sentences, and zeroing of determiners, ubjects, copula, and prepositions.Explicit pronouns and dummy subjects are raze, as are interrogatives, indirect questions, imperatives, andconditionals.
Where temporal relations are explicitly marked, they are commonly marked by preposedtime adverbials.
Modals are raze.In contrast, our initial corpus of user inputs to VOYAGER shows, not surprisingly, that interrogatives andimperatives are more frequent han statements.
The types of zeroing seen in telegraphic narrative do notoccur in the corpus 2, nor do nominalizations and run-ons.
Passives are rare.
Dummy it and there arecommon, as are I and you, and (in the context of questions about restaurants) they.
Preposing (other thanwh-movement) does not occur.
Modals are common.
Many of these differences are p~edicted by consideringthe two genres to be at opposite ends along Biber's textual dimensions of 'involved versus informationalproduction', narrative vs. non-narrative concerns', and 'abstract vs. non-abstract information' \[Bib88\].We plan to take advantage of such differences to tune the system for the VOYAGER task.In terms of discourse structure, we might expect here to be radical differences between messages and dia-logue, but in fact here there are interesting similarities.
The basic interactional unit in VOYAGER dialoguecan be characterized as the request-response pair (e.g.
Where are you?
At MIT.).
A similar request-response structure appears in messages containing labelled discourse segments (or header fields) , e.g.Fa i led  Par t :  system tape.
Cause of Fa i lu re :  tape ,as  wound backwards.
Here, the messageoriginator can be viewed as answering the implicit questions What part failed?
What caused the failure ?2Nevertheless,  ell iptical quest ions and  answers are certainly seen in task-or lented dialogue, e.g.
North:  \[It meant  to\] ...basical ly clear up  the record.
Nields: Did you?
North:  Tried to.
Nields: Then?
North:  No ... \[Scr87\]61\[Bal89\] discusses our approach to handling such structured messages as a series of  quest ion/answer pairs,and we were able to extend this approach to dialogue.The interactional structure of  monologue and dialogue is, of  course, quite different.
To provide the controlstructure for dialogue, we extended a query front-end (QFE) which had been developed for database queryapplications.
The result is a general dialogue manager which can be used for a variety of  interactiveapplications.SYSTEM ARCHITECTUREThe system contains four major  components:  the VOYAGER front-end (VFE), PUNDIT,  a query translat ionand interface module (QTIP), and the VOYAGER expert system.
The first three components are currentlyrunning on Sun workstations under Quintus Prolog, and VOYAGER, which is written in Lisp, runs on aSymbolics machine.

> \[ PUNDIT INewContext \[ \[< I \[V0YAGERFigure 1: PUNDIT -~- VOYAGER System FlowVFE is a dialogue manager,  which uses PUNDIT and QTIP as resources to interpret and respond to theuser's requests.
As discussed below, VOYAGER is also a conversational participant, whose utterances must62be analyzed and integrated into the discourse context.
VFE administers the turn-taking structure, andmaintains a higher-level model of the discourse than that available to PUNDIT.
This level of knowledgeenables it, for example, to call the parser in different modes, depending on preceding discourse (see below).VFE alSO keeps track of the current speaker and hearer, so that PUNDIT's Reference Resolution componentcan correctly interpret I and you.PUNDIT, as described in (\[HPD+89\], \[PDP+86\], \[Dah86\]), provides syntactic, semantic, and pragmaticinterpretation.
The input to PUNDIT is currently text, and the output is a set of semantic representationsand other predications representing the discourse context (the DISCOURSE LIST), and a list of entities infocus, ordered by saliency (the FOCUS LIST).QTIP'S function is to translate PUNDIT representations into LISP function calls, to pass these to VOYAGER,and to return VOYAGER'S response to VFE.
QTIP also incorporates ome knowledge about VOYAGER'Scapabilities which enables it to trap certain types of queries for appropriate action by VFE.
For example,VOYAGER cannot answer direction requests with an unspecified starting point, unless it knows where theuser is.
In this case, QTIP informs VFE that it must elicit the user's location.
As another example, VOYAGERcannot answer questions about whether a class of objects is located on a street.
QTIP traps such questions,and VFE informs the user:User :  I s  there  a subway s ta t ion  on Church  St reet?VFE : Sor ry ,  Voyager  can ' t  determine  whether  someth ing  i s  on a s t reet .QTIP a l so  monitors the state of the machine-machine interface to VOYAGER, and notifies VFE when thelink is down or VOYAGER is not loaded; VFE then notifies the user.The final component is the VOYAGER expert system, a version of which has been made available to us byMIT.
VOYAGER includes a generation component, and one of our initial issues was how to deal with itsoutput.
Clearly, it would be a poor sort of interactive system that did not allow for ordinary anaphoricand definite reference to entities introduced in the course of the conversation, e.g.
to Royal East in theexample below:A: I s  there  a res taurant  near  here?B: .
.
.
The neaxest  res tauxant  to  HIT i s  Roya l  East  .
.
.?
:  What k ind  of  food  does  i t  serve7However, in order to integrate VOYAGER'S conversational contribution into the discourse context, we werefaced with the choice of (a) modifying VOYAGER to return some semantic representation of its utterances(together with information relevant o focusing), or (b) simply treating VOYAGER as an ordinary con-versational participant, and using PUNDIT to analyze what VOYAGER said.
The latter proved the mostexpedient course of action.
Though not the most efficient approach in the long run, it has the unexpectedbenefit of allowing us to look at issues on both sides of the dialogue.MAINTAIN ING THE D ISCOURSE CONTEXTInteractive systems must provide for the strategies by which speakers refer to what has been previouslydiscussed, e.g.
one-anaphora:Q1.
Is there a restaurant that serves seafood near MIT?
... Q2.
Is there one near Harvard?A system which does not handle anaphoric and definite references requires unnatural behaviour on thepart of the user, who will be forced to refer to all entities as though they were brand-new in the discourse,e.g.
Q2':Q2'.
Is there a restaurant that serves seafood near Harvard?63But it is clearly not sufficient o allow reference only to what the user has said, for the system's responseforms part of the user's discourse context, as illustrated above and below.These points, of course, are not specific to the application or domain, but adhere to language and dia-logue.
For this reason, the discourse processing facilities of PUNDIT ate largely embodied in the domain-independent Reference Resolution module.
This module, which required no significant extensions for theVOYAGER application, is capable of handling a variety of referential strategies.
In the following annotateddialogue, we illustrate some of the capabilities of Reference Resolution and the importance of understand-ing both sides of the dialogue.!
User :2 VFE :3 Vgr :I s  there  a res taurant  near  Harvard  ?I ' l l  ask  Voyager .
.
.I can ' t  determine  i f  ob jec ts  a re  near  someth ing .I ' l l  t ry  to  f ind  the  nearest  one .The nearest  res taurant  to  Harvard  Un ivers i ty  i s  Border  Care .Border  Care  i s  located  a t  32 Church  St reet .Comments :  VOYAGER's response is processed by PUNDIT and integrated into the discoursecontext.
As a result, the Border Cafe enters the list of entities in focus, and is thus availablefor anaphoric reference in (4) below.4 User :  What k ind  o f  food  does  i t  serve  ?8 VFE : X ' l l  ask  Voyager .
.
.6 Vgr : Border  Care  serves  Mex ican  food .Comments :  i t -  the user is referring to the Border Care, an entity introduced by VOYAGER inturn (3).
Reference Resolution quickly finds this entity, which is at the head of the Focus List.7 User :  How do I get  there?8 VFR : X' l l  ask  Voyager .
.
.Where  are  youY9 User :  At NIT .10 VFE : Ok.
I w i l l  te l l  Voyager .
.
.11 Vgr : MIT i s  located  in  the  area  o f  77 Massachuset ts  Avenue.I ' l l  t ry  to  f ind  the  beet  way to  got  f rom HIT to  Border  Care .I f  your  car  i s  on the  same s ide  of  the  s t reet  as  NITp s tar t  d r iv ing .Take the  next  le f t  onto  Hassachuset ts  Avenue.
There  i s  a t ra f f i c  l ightthere .A f te r  you  c ross  Garden  St reet ,  take  the  next  r ight  onto  Church  St reet .Border  Care  i s  about  one e ighth  mi le  down on your  le f t  s ide .Comments :  there in (7) is interpreted as an anaphoric reference to a salient location.
Note theclarification dialogue (VOYAGER will need to know the starting point), where VFE becomes thequerier.
Since there is a salient wh-query in the context (Where are you?
), VFE anticipates ashort response s and calls the parser and semantics in a special mode.
The user's short responseis analyzed and bound to the variable in the query (where), and VFE creates a new proposition:The user is at MIT.
This information, together with the translation of the original query (Howdo f get there?)
is passed to VOYAGER.3For purposes of the present discussion, a short response is one which is not a complete sentence, e.g.
What im your name fMary Smith vs. My name ia Mary Smith.
See \[Hiz79\] for a discussion of short responses.6412 User :  Nhat ' s  the  phone  number?13 VFE : I ' l l  ask  Voyager .
.
.14 Vgr  : The te lephone  number of  Border  Care  i s  864-6100.Comments :  the phone number is a definite reference to an inferrable entity (cf.
\[Pri81\]).
Thereis no previously mentioned telephone number, and yet it is a stereotypic assumption that certainclasses of objects, e.g.
commercial establishments, have phone numbers.
This information isencoded in our knowledge base.
Reference Resolution looks for previously-mentioned entitiesthat have the property of having phone numbers, and finds the Border Care.15 User :16 VFE :17 Vgr :I s  there  a subway s top  near  the  res taurant?I ' l l  ask  Voyager .
.
.I can ' t  determ?ne i f  ob jec ts  evce near  someth ing .I ' l l  t ry  to  f ind  the  neares t  one .The neexest  subway s top  to  Border  Cage i s  Haxvaxd  Sta t ion .Harvard  S ta t ion  i s  located  a t  the  in tersect ion  o f  Nassachuset tsAvenue  and  Church  S t reet .Comments :  the restaurant is a definite reference to the Border Cafe.
Note that it would notbe correct to look for the last explicit mention of a restaurant, for this algorithm would findthe restaurant introduced in turn 1: Is there a restaurant near Harvard.
9 Instead, ReferenceResolution looks for the salient entity of type  restaurant, and finds the Border Cafc.CURRENT COVERAGE AND ISSUESCurrent coverage on our training corpus of 174 VOYAGER inputs is 57%; that is, 100 of the utterances arecorrectly processed by VFE, PUNDIT and QTIP, and are sent to VOYAGER.
We plan to increase coverageto 90%, and will then test the system on a more extensive corpus of spontaneous queries, collected byMIT.
In addition, we plan to collect and analyze samples of task-orlented ialogue, in order to evaluatethe system performance in providing a co-operative interface for interactive problem-solving.One of the issues which we anticipate addressing is the interpretation of additional types of questions, e.g.short questions.
For example, the notions of focus and open proposition (cf.
\[Pri86\]) seem crucial to theinterpretation of sequences such as Are there any bars around MIT?
... How about clubs?
...
Restaurants?.We also intend to further explore the relationship between the information structure of the question andthe answer, in order to optimize the processing of the answer.
For example, when VFE asks a clarificationquestion such as Where are you?, we construct an open proposition whose variable is typed as a location 4.We can therefore anticipate a cohesive response from the user in which the open proposition is satisfiedby a location.
A short response is maximally cohesive (M IT  or At  MIT) ,  and we currently anticipate thepossibility of this type of response, and call the parser first for an NP fragment, and then (if that fails) fora PP fragment.
We could go farther by expecting certain types of prepositional phrases, namely locationexpressions (e.g.
By subway would be an incoherent response).
For the long response ( I  am at MIT) ,we may expect the focus to be accented, and the material corresponding to the open proposition to bede-accented.
Such expectations should prove useful for speech recognition.These are not only important research issues, but we believe them to have a direct bearing on the ult imateperformance of the system, in terms of user satisfaction and time to accurately complete the task.4Intult ively,  an  open propos i t ion is an  express ion conta in ing an  unbound variable.65References\[Ba189\] Catherine N.
