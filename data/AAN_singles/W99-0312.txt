A mark up language for tagging discourse and annotatingdocuments in context sensitive interpretation environmentsGraziella TonfoniThe George Washington UniversityDeclassilication Productivity Research Center (DPRC)Ashburn, VA 20147tonfoni@seas.gwu.eduandDSLO-University of Bologna-Italytonfoni@alma.unibo.itAbstractA mark up language for tagging discourse,and for converting discourse sequences intoa written format, according to highly contextsensitive procedures, will be illustrated aswell as a system for document annotation.The context in which a givencommunicative intercourse has taken placeneeds to be made available to ensureconsistent interpretation of both singlesequences of discourse and global conceptsthat are carried along during the dialogue orconversation.
Full vis~ility of differentcommunicative intentions that reflect theevolution of conversations in time andspace, as well as access to various modes ofcommunicative actions and changingconditions of interpretation, is relevant andnecessary, especially in contexts whereinteraction is based upon asynchronouscommunication.
Interpretation ~hif~s, thateach sequence of a dialogue is likely toundergo, may create distortions in theinterpretation of the overall intercourse andcommunicative action leading to thecreation of the final document.
Somecontextual concretions, which may be basedupon false assumptions, are particularlypowerful Persistent interpretative linksmay be evoked and activated at any time,even if unintentionally.
Special attentionneeds to be paid to ensure that undesirablelinks are not established and unintentionalcontextual concretions are not added.
Useof a consistently applied, commonly sharedconceptual tool for assit~ning context-sensitive interpretative values to eachsequence of discourse holds great promisefor avoidance of this problem Appropriatelypackaged ocuments and parts of documentscould carry along their own originatingcontext of discourse in the form of attachedinformation.
Accurate illustrations using afidly functional set of tools I have developedare provided here to show how fi~zzinessand misinterpretation (caused by an absenceof consistent interpretative clues aboutoriginating contextual conditions fordiscourse and conversations) may besignificantly reduced or even eliminated.IntroductionA document comes ~om "somewhere intime and space and leads toward somewhereelse"(Tonfoni, 1998).It may therefore be defined as a piece ofinformation that has been derived t~om a94dynamically evolving information flowbefore it is converted into a stable form, e.g.,hardcopy (Tonfoni 1996, 1998).
Documentsare derivative products of flows ofconversations and various kinds ofcommunicative intercourse, which mayinclude a very high level of complexity andlong duration.
Documents andconversations, ~om which those documentswere generated, are therefore two verytightly linked components hat often play acrucial role in providing evidence fordecision making.
It is our claim thatenhanced encoding procedures in the formof discourse tagging and labelling may beharmoniously linked by means of aconsistent annotation system (Tonfoni 1998)to support accurate conversion of dialoguesand discourse into a more stable format.This is what documentation is all about.The discourse tagging system presented hereis based on and harmonious linked to anannotation system, which consists of a set ofsigns and symbols as follows:Discourse tagging and documentannotation signs: to indicate thecommunicative function of a sequenceof discourse, which is ultimately tobecome apiece of a document.Discourse tagging and documentannotation symbols: to indicate thecommunicative s~le of each sequenceof discourse, which is ultimately tobecome apiece of a document.- Discourse tagging and documentannotation turn taking symbols: toindicateroles and interplay between thediscourse partners that are carried alongduring theinformation conversion process andsuccessively attached to the resultingdocument.Context sensitivity may be significantlyenhanced by the consistent use ofinterpretation devices, designed to preventfilthiness and misunderstanding fromoccurring.
Some contextual links, if notproperly handled, may be powerful enoughto radically shifl the scenario.
Theoriginating context may in fact be easilymodified and completely distorted, even ifunintentionally.
Such links need to beaccurately identified and then efiminated byrepositioning, either by reassessing theoriginating context or assessing the new andintended one.A context sensitive mark up language forconverting discourse sequences intodocument pieces.Discourse tagging and documentannotation signs: The following representthe various communicative functions adocm~ent may convey, on a paragraph byparagraph basis, as a result of consistentconversation of discourse sequences intodocument pieces.II - Square: for an informative document or piece of a document,which carries information about aspecific conversational event.Indicates that information conversionhas been derived from an informativediscourse sequence.D Square within the Square: for a summary of a given document thathas been produced to reinforcecontextual consistency between theconversational context in which thediscourse first occurred and itsconversion i to a larger document.Frame: for a document or piece of adocument that is found to beanalogous (in content) to other?
95?E3Ddocuments which refer to pr~Aous!ystored information, some of whichmay still be available in discourseformat.
Normally, conversion occurs~,om discourse format into documentformat.Triangle: for a memory and historygenerated out of a certain document.This is meant to establish topicalcontinuity wdth backgroundinformation, which may still only beavailable in its discourse format andstill need to be converted intodocument format.Circle: for a main concept conveyedby a certain document, which hasbeen abstracted and linked to otherdoc~ents, to show topicalconfimfity, It is meant to reinforcetopical word identification and toeffectb;e!y l'mk together documents-with the same word and sequences ofdiscourse prior to their conversioninto document format, Bothdiscourse and document (may) usethe same topical words.Grouped Semicircles: for mainconcepts, which are abstracted out ofan originating document, Establishesboth topical continu'~ and contextconsistency between the ori_ginafingdocument, and a set of topical wordsand links to sequences of discourseprior to conversion i to a doc~.mentformat, Here again, both discourseand document (may) use the sametopical words.Semicircle: for a locally identifiedconcept, abstracted out of a piece ofdocument and meant to reinforcecontext consistency by establishingfurther links to other documents.These links may be triggered by thesame topical word.
It is also meant otrigger sequences of discourse priorto convermon i to a document formatand using the same topical word~Inscribed .Ares: for indicating theneed for an upgrade and/or update ofa certain document.
Indicates that arevision process is likely to occur,although it does not identify if it willbe a major or minor revision.Revision may be based onconversion of discourse sequencesinto additional pieces of a documentor into various alterations.Opened Text Space: for indicatingthat an upgrade and/or update hasindeed occurred and that thedocument has now reached 'a newre~Asion state.
It is meant to showthat the structure of the ~eviousdocument has been affected bydiscursive information, but does notidentify if the revision has been amajor or a minor one,,Right Triangle: for a commentmade about a given document orpiece of a document, for the casewhere more contextual informationis needed.
This information is notavailable in a document format andhas to be derived f~om other ~xternalrelevant sources based upon topicalcontinuity.Discourse tagging and documentannotation symbols are used to indicatecommunicative intentions and styles, locallywithin the discourse, such that discoursesequences can be consistently and accurate!yinterpreted with the the additionalinformation they provide.
They areparticularly useful for showing contributionsmade by individuals in either synchronousor asynchronous conversations, and forsupporting co-ordination and "m?ormationcom, ersion for production of a document,96These information-containing elements maybe conveniently incorporated into the finaldocument to provide clues about he natureof the original information conversionprocess.
Document annotation symbols,therefore, represent different modes ofinformation conversion (from a discourse)which may be packaged with the originatingcontext, and activated at a later time.
Theymay be combined and used dynamically forNarrate: from Latin tuTrro: tellthe story.It means complementing the discourse or thedocument with various facts and events(from the originating context) by followinga logical and chronological order.
They maybe used either in the form of discourse or inthe form of the document itself.
In otherwords, it indicates a set of major points orfacts representing different diachronicfurther information conversion purposes, stages, which are closely linked.II such as further discussions, because theyeffectively indicate transitional states w/thln , ~  Point out: take a single point1 a discourse that may be evolving in time and -----o---- out of a story chain.\[\] space: They are of the following types: It means to isolate a specific\[\] ?\[\]Describe: from Latin describo:write around.It means complementing the originaldiscourse or document by adding asmuch relevant information as may befound from previous discourse,without any specific onstraints.It may also indicate the need for furtherinformation to be put together in discourseformat or in document format.
It isrepresented by a spiral, which starts from itsmiddle point, to indicate a flow ofinformation from topical words, towards anexpanding topic and linking with otherinformation.
The other information cancome from different discourse sequences orfrom other elevant documents or pieces ofdocuments.Define: from Latin definio: putlimits.It means complementing thedocument or the discourse with limitedinformation about a defined topical word,which has been previously selected andidentified as the most relevant.
The point inthe middle of the square representsrelevance.
The concept indicates that here isa real need to incorporate available, highlyspecific information about a relevantdiscourse or document.event or fact (among those reported asdiscourse or occurring within a document)by focusing on just one sequence or a pieceof document, and adding more detailedreformation.
Information is added by as asignificant expansion and linked with otherrelevant discourse sequences ordocuments.Explain: from Latin explano:unwrap, open up.It means that facts and reasons arer ?
given to support interpretation fan event, within a certaindiscourse or document.
Explanation maystart by indicating the originating cause andproceeding logically toward the effects or bystarting with the effects and goingbackwards towards the cause, depending onwhich approach is found to be the mosteffective.\ [ \ [~\ [  Regress: from Latin regredior:go back.I I ~1 "1 It means that more informationabout a topic, presented uring a givendiscourse sequence or within a document, isabsolutely necessary for understanding.Information may come in verbal format andthen be converted into document format.
Itrepresents a topic-oriented process and an indepth information expansion, which isactivated only for the precise topic beingconsidered.97Inform: from Latin informo: putinto shape, shape up.It means that any discourse anddocument is the result of an informationpackaging process, and that the specificdiscourse and document under considerationis organised in the most unconstrained way,as the result of many information conversionoperations.It leads toward two different kinds of furtherspecification, which are respectivelyconveyed by the "inform synthetically" andthe "inform analytically" indication.
''inform synthetically" meansdeparting from a larger discourse ordocumentand proceeding toward a summary (relatedto a specific topic) which is the mostrelevant one emerging from the originatingdiscourse and document.
"inform analytically" meansdeparting from a limited discourseand document and expanding toward furtherdiscourse sequences and documents byadding more information, which needs to hethen converted into the final form of adocument, and is not available yet.Reformulate: from Latinreformo/reformulo: changeshape and reshape.It means changing the style, which waspreviously adopted, either in the discourseor in the document, and substituting oneform of information packaging with adifferent but related (same discourse ordocument) packaging.
It may turn produce(a more or less) radical transformation f theoriginating context, according to a preciselydefined request or set of requests.Express: from Latin exprimo:push out and press out.It means adding personal opinions andindividual feelings related to facts and98events during a discourse or within adocument.
It indicates the most subjectivemode of information organisation, whichmay be clearly influenced by and hound topersonal evaluations, judgements andemotional states.Discourse tagging and documentannotation turn taking symbols are meantto define the mode of interpretation of acertain discourse and of accessing a certaindocument, requested at each given time;they are provided to facilitate accuratecontext transport.They are the following ones:Major Scale: it shows that literalinterpretation is needed and thatthose sequences of discourse orpieces of documents indicated andmarked ot~ should be extracted andquoted literary, the way they werefirst intended to be.Minor Scale: k shows that accurateinterpretation may need a furtherprocess of abstraction and thatsequences of discourse and pieces ofdocuments indicated and marked oKmay need significant interpretationprocesses due to heavy contextconstraints.Open or Unsaturated Rhythm: itshows that accessing the discourseand document at the present stagemay lead to an incomplete interpretation fthose facts and events, which are presented.It is meant o suggest accessing a broaderdiscourse and larger document and acquiringmany and various kinds of sources, some ofwhich may not yet be available.Tight or Saturated Rhythm: itshows that accessing thedocument will lead the usertoward complete interpretation f those factsand events, which are presented.
It suggeststhat the user should hold fast to theinterpretation provided, though access toother sources of supportive vidence is alsoavailable.Discourse tagging and documentannotation amplifier symbols come lastand may be added only after the previouslyillustrated ones have been used.
They applyto larger discourse sequences anddocumentation territories and indicatespecific operations, which are to beperformed in order to connectconversational actions and sets ofdocuments, which have been previouslyencoded and accurately stored.They are as follows:Choose: it is meant o represent the"x..~ynamic process of first identif3~ingand then deciding between differentcontexts for interpretation, which aremutually exclusive, given a certain set ofconversations, which have occurred anddocuments, which have been derivedaccordingly, but seem to have differentpossible volutions.I Identify: it is meant o represent a> definition of a more specific contextwithin a broader context, forinterpretation of a set of conversations,which have occurred and for documents hathave been derived.
It naturally occursbefore "search" and "select".Search: it is meant o represent thedynamic process of choosing amongdifferent contexts for interpretationof a set of conversations, which haveoccurred and documents, which have beenderived and are many and compatible as tofind the most appropriate one.Select: it is meant to represent~ ~/  multiple contexts that may evolve(either synchronously orasynchronously) and may be modified, oncea certain decision making process has beenperformed.
It is based upon a certaindiscourse that was converted into adocument and stored.Copy/Replicate: it is meant torepresent he dynamic process ofduplication and repetition of acontext, which ff lost, would affectunderstanding and accuracy of interpretationof events and facts that have been organised,first in the form of discourse and thenconverted into a document.Ahead: it is meant o represent theprogression of a conversation tobecome a document or set ofdocuments, which are linkedtogether by context consistency orharmoniously shifting contexts.Back: it is meant to represent theneed to go back to delete and replacethe originating context, which hasradically shifted, in the course ofvarious transition states, during anongoing conversation such that, ifnot eliminated, would indeed affectconsistent interpretation f a wholeset of documents, which are basedupon it.Conflict; it is meant o represent anemerging inconsistency andincompatibility between variouscontext attributions to a set ofconversations to be converted intodocuments, the context needs to becleared as to proceed toward anyfurther interpretation.The discourse tagging and documentannotation system we have illustrated here(including its various components) may beappfied at different layers and at variouslevels of complexity.99Following this perspective, discoursecontext may be enhanced through visualclues or symbols to provide a very powerfulmeans to monitor inherent complexity ofany communicative intercourse and toreduce possible distortions which mayOCCur.ConclusionsThis system for tagging discourse providesconsistent and harmonious linkages to theoriginal context in the form of a mark uplanguage for visually annotatingdocumentation.
It has been extensively andintensively tested in many and variouscontext and languages .The acronym, CPP --TKS stands for Communicative PositioningProgram-- Text Kepresentation Systems.What is therefore indicated is that iconsrepresenting precise operations performedupon texts, both in their verbal and writtendimensions, carry the effective intentionalityto be encapsulated.
Encoding and pre-programming a document means preciselycomplementing a document with all of theinstructions that are necessary to enhanceunderstanding of context.
Visualprogramming of a document (based onprevious discourse) provides the ability tocategorise and classify information and tocarry the full details of a context into the(delicate) process of information conversionto ensure the most reliable final product,e.g., the document.AcknowledgementsThe author sincerely thanks Dr. RichardScotti, Director of the DPKC, for readingthis paper, prior to its submittal, and morefor having captured the relevance of themost important features of her system andapproach, creating the appropriateconditions for producing practicalapplications of it in the real world.Basic referencesTonfoni, G., 1996, Communication Patternsand Textual Forms, Intellect, Exeter, U.K..Tonfoni, G., 1998, Information Design: TheKnowledge Architect's Toolkit, ScarecrowPress, Lanham, Maryland, U.S.100
