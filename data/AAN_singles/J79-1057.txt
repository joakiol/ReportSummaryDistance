The Text-to-Speech SystemA system to convert unregtricted printed text to speech has been underdevelopment for several years at M.I.T.
1,2,3 The approach has been to modelthe proces-s employed by a nat'ive speaker of English when reading aloud.
Inorder to develop correct computational algorithms for the pronunciation ofEnglish words, it has been necessary to reflect the basic nature of linguis-tic processes.
Consequently, considerable emphasis has been placed on thedevelopment of morphological and phon~logical analysis, stress patterns,parsing systems and prosodic correlates.It i$ possible, using the current system, to convert any English wordor string df words in a textual representation to intelligible speech.
Inorder to effect this conversion, a number of subsystems are utilizedincluding mo~phological analysis, letter-to-sound rules, stress rules andphonemic speech synthesis.
Prosodic studies are now in grogress; experi-mental parameters for fo contours and timing patterns will soon be includedIn %he system.The letter-string which represents a word is usually converted to aphoneme string in preparation for speech synthesis by a process of morpho-lop,ical analysis.
Amorph lexicon c - o n t n i n i n q  approximately 11,000 entrieshas been d r v ~ l  loped and is  i l sed  i n  r o n  j r i n c t  ion with n rnorph dec*ompos i t  iona l g o r i t h m .
I n c l u d e d  i n  the lexicon are two m a j o r  classes  oE rnorphs.
OneI 1  1 1  I I class is composed of roots such as trust" and snow, i .
c .
; words which cqlroccur alone, and bound roots such as -ceive perceive, receive, connive),rot- (rotary, rotate, rotor) and -miss- (dismiss, missive, permiqsiveness).A?
fixes make up the second class and may be attached either to roots or t cbound morphemes.
Accompanying each l e x i c a l  e n t r y  is  i t s  phonemic representa-t i o n ,  i t s  morph class and its p a r t ( s )  of speech.Algorithfnic decomposifion of l e t t e r - s t r i n g s  models the p r ~ c e d u r e  usedby a native speaker when confronted by a word which he does not  immediatelyrecognize o r  has previously  no t  encountered.

A standard form f o r  sequences ofmorphemes is  compared with  each p o s s i b i i i t y ,  and r u l e s  describing p r e f e r r e dcomposition are used i n  a pa i rwise  comparison leading t o  an acceptabler e s u l t .
The word "formally" provides an example i n  which the o n l y  ruleneeded is one s t a t i n g  t h a t  a roo t  followed by a s u f f i x  i s  p r e f e r a b l e  t o  twoconcatenated r o o t s .
Poss ib le  decompositionsof the word "formally" are1 t detected as foklows (R represents root1' and $, tlsuf-fix") :form (R) + a1 (S) + ly (S) f o m  (R) + ally (R)for.
(R) ,+ mall (R) + y (S) form (R) + all (R) + y (S)It is clear that the correct decomposition is the only candidate having theform of a single root followed by suffixes.When a complete morphemic analysis fails, that is, when a word encoun-tered by a'native speaker cannot be se~arated into its constituent morphemes,or when it is so infrequent in the English language that he has previouslynot encountered it, a "letter-to-sound" system is invoked, i .
e .
,  an attemptis made to sound out the word letter by 'letter.
The competence of a nativespeaker which allows him to perform this convemsion is based on correspon-dence& between l'etters and sounds in English which have been internalizedthrough experience.
(A native speaker will also apply the same correspon-dences to a foreign-word from any language of which he has nQ knowledge.
)A scheme; to model this process,musE be made available, sequenced after thedecomposition algorithm, in,order to be ablk to convert unrestricted text tospeech.
The text-ro-speech system includes a phonological model having atwo-phase structure: the first phase is 3 set of rules which convertsletters to phonemes, and the second is an algorithm for placement of stresson the converted phonemes.This system has been implemented ;In RCPI, on n DEC PDP-9 and on a PDP-10inbMAC LISP.Onp might ask why, with a set of letter-to-sound rules available, itis necessary to have a lexicon.
There hre three reasons; all are restrictionswhich must be imposed om any viabl'e letter-to-sound system.
-First, it hasbeen observed t h a t  high-frequency wotds perhaps because of ex tens ive  use ,  donbt  always fo l low le t te r - to-sound r u l e s .
For example, t h e  on ly  i n s t a n c e  i nwhich a f i n a l  Lf] is pronounced a s  /v/ is  i n  t h e  word "of I f  The l e t t e r  [w]9 I fo l lowing a consonant is  g e n e r a l l y  pronounced l i k e  t h e  [w] i n  sweett1 o r" t w ~ l l , "  b u t  i n  t h e  word "two" i t  is  not  pronounced a t  a l l .

,  However, twelve of t h e  200 words began withvoiced [ t h l .Secondly, it must b e  recognized t h a t  t h e  f e t t e r ~ t o - s o u n d  r u l e s  whicho p e r a t e  w i t h i n  a morpheme, do not ,  ~ e c e s s a r i l y  apply  a c r o s s  morph bounddries.In  p a r t i c u l a r ,  t h e  p ronunc ia t i an  of compounds t e q u i r e s  a l ex icon .

The a p p l i c a t i o n  ofle t te r - to-sound r u l e s  must t h e r e f o r e  be restricted to words conta in ing  no morethan  a s i n g l e  r o o t .Thirdly, f o r e i g n  words which r e t a i n  t h e i r  o r i g i n a l  p r m u n c i a t i o n  mustbe l e x i c a l  e n t r i e s .

The rule for pronuncia-tion uf [cch] , then, appears before rhe rules for [cc] and ich], each ofwhich is ordered before rules for LC] and [h].
Procedures for the recog-nition of prefixes and suffixes also require an ordering: t'le pfefixeslcomj and [con] must be ordered before [co]; any suffSx ending with theletter Ls] must be recognizpd before the suffix consisting of 'that letteronly.As an example of ordering rules for a particular string, considerthe vowel [a] and .assume that it is followed by the Letter Cr].
This [a f1 I may be pr,onounced like the [ a?
in "warp, " "lariat" or carp" dependingupon spebif ication of further context.
It is pronounced like the [ a] inI I carp" if it is followed by [r] and another consonant (other than Lr])and if it is preceded by any consonant phoneme except /w/ (n,ote "quarter, 11"wharf") Consequentlv, a rule for [a1 in the context of being preceded7 by the phoneme /w/ ~d.followed by the sequence [ r ~ ]  is placed in the set-of rules.
~~rcif'ication of a left context in the rule for the [a] in11 carp" is subsequentl!
Unnecessary.
If the [a] is preceded by a /w/ ,  t h i srule will never be reached; if preceded by a vowel, a rule for voweldigraph9 will already have- applied.
Using this method.
rules may be statedsimply and without redundancy.Development of the set of phonological rules was begun by informal8 inspection and reference to published works, e.g.

Thephonemes f t /  and /d/ preceding unstressed /u/ or / U  / not in the first syl-lable are chgnged following the cyclic rules which place all stress.

Boblems  of this type include incorrect suffix or prefixrecognition and the treatment of compounds as single norphs.
Some examplesfrom each problem area are given below:Mispronunciation of single vowel:internationalmenu/e/ modeled / e /*/u/ strategf - cally / ?
/environmental - /r/ bur - jed /PIhotels - /a/ two -The pr~nunciations of the underlined vowels in the contexts aboveark encountered infrequently, and, in most cases, are not predictable.
Inthe word international, the context which determines the pronunciation of@]is the right-hqnd context Lc+~v], A 10- xowel almost always is found inthis context as in nation, station, explanation, observational, gensational.A short [el is usually found preceding PC], e.g .
, maleuc ,  angelic ,.
systemic,photogenic, and is long only in a few words, e.g., strategic, scenic, andthe suffix *legit.
.There are very few words ending in the vowel[u]--most are ei ther  low frequency words or proper names.
The palatalizationin menu is not found in other words with finallu], e .
g .
,  flu, emu, gnu,--i'mprqmptu.
The word - two is very irregular in pronunciation.
Most wordsending in[o]such as E, - no, so, calico, echo have the sound lo/.
It maybe noted, however, that two other words which, like -1 two m e  very high fre-quency words, have the same pronunciation of final[o]as -9 two i.e., - do, - to.The mispronunciation of the[e]in modeled is due to the assumption, lackinga lexicon, that the morphemic analysis is -- model C - ed.Mispronunciation of vowel digraph:said-break - /i/forfeit-endowed-shoes-should, - would -theirs-The reasons for mispronunciation of the vowel digraphs underlined abovefall into a number of categories.
There  are very high frequency words,said, should and would, which do not follow letter-to-sound rules.
Saidmay be contrasted with the words laid, maid, paid, and raid; the wordsshould and would contrast with mould, shoulder and boulder.
The sequencebir] as in theiys, heir, weir is not found frequently in English, nor isthe sequence (feit] as in for?
eit surfsit and counterfeit .
Rules for ki],....9in these two contexts w@rakcskis:risidered unproductive.
~inal t o 4  in Englishis usually pronounced as in oboe, toe a A  foe; the pronunciation found inshoe, and also in canoe, is rare.
Rules governing the pronunciation of&ow] (endowed) and bi] (guitars) are statistically based.
Althougfi there arerna~ywordo in- w h i e k h l l a r  nort=ccmt ext dsqxmdmt-prwornlat3m~~s m,e.g., -9 cow' allow, eyebrow and build, guilt, guinea, other pronunciationsare statistically more likely, e.g., those found in shadow, glow, followand bruise, juice, nuisance.
The ptonunciation of break is not-predictable-- the word steak has the same digraph pronunciation, but other similarwords such as creak, freak and Streak are pronounced like the majority ofwords congaining the digraph Lea],Mispronunciation of .single consonant:of- /f/ c o r ~  /PIeager / j/ exhaust - /h/two - /w / physiological - /s/deserts - /s/ schizophrenic - /z/The consonants underlined above are either silent or have unpredict-able or unusual pronunciations.
Silent consonants are found in two, corp-and exhaust .- The yord  two is a h'igh-frequency word in which both the l&] ahdb] have unusual pronunciatio~s .
Silent M is rare, although it is alsofound in the word sword.
Pinal silent [d, as found in corp is also rare.
(This word is c~~sidered in this section because the pronunciation of boththe,[r]and therp] are determined by rules for single consonants.)
There area few tmrds, like exhaust, in which [h] is .silent following kx], e. g .
exhibit,exhilarate, exhort and exhume.
However, this rule is not sufficientlyproductive to merit inclusion.The letter b] preceding (e],[il and ty] in English usually has a soft soundas in integer and wager.
In particular, many words ending inber] ark acombinatton of a root with final [el and the Buff ix her], e. g .
, mrager, manager,merger, all of which have a soft [g] sound.
The pronunciation of the \g] ineager is unusual and not predictable.
Another pr~nunciation which is fre-quently unpredictable, i.e., not context-dependent,, ts that of the lqtter[s]between vowels.
The rule for this context predic~ the more frequent sound/ s /  whereas the sound / z /  is found in deserts and physiologieal.
Theletter [ z] in schizophrenic has the rgre pronunciation /ts/, and the word - if,as previous ly  discussed,  i s  t h e  only English word i n  which a f i n a l  [f] i schef- / c /  laugh- /-/wauld -3 should - /ld) c l i c h e s7/E/calf - /lf / i s s u e  - /s/tsar- / ts/  - these /e  /Consonant c l u s t e r s  are in?

Words are pronounced incorrect ly  because l e t t e r  s t r i ngs  i n  aroot  which appear t o  be suffixes are converted t o  phonemes using ,rulesf o r  su f f i x  pronunciation.

A few pref ixes  such as[a]in apart andp] i n  eject  have not  beenincluded because a high error rate would result, i.e., all words begipningin &or g would be incorrectly analyzed.
In the remaining cases, prefixeswere incorrectly analyzed as part of a root after suffixes were incorrectlyremoved.
Errors in pronunciation, and particularly in stress are the result.Incorrect stress:Most of the words in this category have unusual stress patternswhich are unpredictable.
A comparison with similar words shows the regularstress pattern:1motel1palette1sonata1urea1uncomfortable1lunatic1renegademarsel, gavel9 fuel1 1 1majorette, crurette, suffragette1 1 1 -vertebra, camera, automata1 1 1trachea, azalea, miscelanea1 1unaffordable, uncontestable1 '1 1erratic, fanatic, aromaticbrigade, serenade, marinadeThe word selects is stressed incorrectly due to lack of informationconcerning its part of speech (c.f., discussion of modificatiqns in the MainStress Rule).The results of this study indicate that the letter-to-phoneme systemis quite powerful, even in isolaqion.
When considered in the domain of theover-all text-to-speech system in which a lexicon is available for high-frequency words and compounds, the letter-to-phoneme system should be highlyreliable .NOTESAlleq,  J.
