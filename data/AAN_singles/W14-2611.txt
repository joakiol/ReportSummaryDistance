Fermi 2749, 21027 Ispra (VA), ItalyFirstname.Lastname@jrc.ec.europa.euAbstract of the talkIn the past years, there has been an increasingamount of research done in the field of SentimentAnalysis.
This was motivated by the growth in thevolume of user-generated online data, the infor-mation flood in Social Media and the applicationsSentiment Analysis has to different fields ?
Mar-keting, Business Intelligence, e-Law Making, De-cision Support Systems, etc.
Although manymethods have been proposed to deal with senti-ment detection and classification in diverse typesof texts and languages, many challenges still arisewhen passing these methods from the researchsettings to real-life applications.In this talk, we will describe the manner in whichwe employed machine translation together withhuman-annotated data to extend a sentiment anal-ysis system to various languages.
Additionally,we will describe how a joint multilingual modelthat detects and classifies sentiments expressed intexts from Social Media has been developed (atthis point for Twitter and Facebook) and demo itsuse in a real-life application: a project aimed atdetecting the citizens?
