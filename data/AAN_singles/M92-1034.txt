PRC Inc:DESCRIPTION OF THE PAKTUS SYSTE MUSED FOR MUC-4Bruce LoatmanPRC Inc .Technology Division1500 PRC DriveMcLean, VA 22102loatman_bruce @po .gis .prc.comBACKGROUNDThe PRC Adaptive Knowledge-based Text Understanding System (PAKTUS) has been unde rdevelopment as an Independent Research and Development project at PRC since 1984 .
It includesa core English lexicon and grammar, a concept network, processes for applying these to lexical,syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis, and tools that support the adaptation of the generi ccore to new domains, primarily by acquiring sublanguage and domain-specific lexicon andconceptual topic patterns of interest.
The lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis componentswere completed before MUC-4 and required little adaptation .
The discourse analysis component isnew and was completed in the course of applying the system to MUC-4, although it is generic .The overall system is described in [1] .
The present description concentrates on discourse analysis.APPROACHThe overall structure andoperation of PAKTUS are shown inFigure 1 .
Processing proceed smostly sequentially throughpreprocessing (the decomposition ofthe text stream into individualmessages, message segments ,sentences, and words), lexica lanalysis (morphological analysis andmapping of words into entries in thelexicon which contain informationabout their syntax and semantics) ,syntactic analysis (using a parser an dgrammar), semantic analysis(mapping the syntactic structures intoconceptual frames with roles fille dby phrase constituents), discourseanalysis (identification of discoursetopics and noun phrase reference), Figure 1.

Theprimary exception to sequential control flow is the interaction between the syntactic and semanticcomponents at the clause and noun phrase level .
This results in essentially deterministic parsing in253linear time: the first syntactico-semantically successful parse of a sentence is accepted ; others arenever generated.
Moreover, parse time is restricted, and the longest substring, along with anyinitial substring successfully parsed, is returned when parse time is exhausted .Figure 2 shows the discourse analysis module, which was first used for MUC-4, and it sinteraction with the extraction module .
The discourse module is generic for expository text, suc has news reports.
In figure 2, only the conceptual patterns and filter are MUC-4-specific, and theseare part of the extraction component, not discourse analysis .Semantic Structures	 	 Common?

Discourse Analysis and Extraction Detail sThe discourse module operates on the semantic structures (case frames) produced by thesemantic analysis module.
It builds topic structures consisting of sets of case frames that havecommon topic objects and times.
Topic objects are defined as fillers of certain case roles,specifically, 16 of the total 40 case roles used in PAKTUS, as illustrated in Figure 3.
The mostnotable case role that is excluded as a topic object is the Agent.
This is because topic structures aremeant to represent information about entities that are being affected or focused upon in some way ,whereas a single Agent can operate on several different entities .
An example below, from theMUC-4 corpus, will clarify the importance of excluding the Agent as a topic role .A side effect of comparing topic objects for commonality, is that some noun phrases (NPs) wilbe unified (i .e., considered by discourse analysis to have the same referent) .
It is possible(actually quite common) for two NPs to be considered common topic objects, but not be unifie d(e.g., in one MUC-4 passage, PAKTUS considers "crime" and "killing" to have topi ccommonality, but does not unify them since "crime" is more general) .After all case frames have been assigned to topic structures, domain-specific conceptua lpatterns are compared to the case frames, topic-by-topic, binding pattern variables to informatio nthat is extracted and put into event reports whose format is specified by a domain-specific template .254The NP unifications assist in this process, effectively consolidating information that may be widel ydispersed in the text.
Note that a single topic structure may contain information on multiple events .The final step in the extraction process is to filter and merge the event reports (e.g., for MUC-4,ignoring events that are too old, and merging events that can not be distinguished in time o rlocation), and format the results to the output file.Figure 3.
Case Roles Determining Topic Objects in PAKTU SEXAMPLE OF MUC-4 DOCUMENT PROCESSIN GMessage number 48 from the "test2" set, which is reprinted in Appendix F, will be used t oillustrate PAKTUS's operation for MUC-4 .
PAKTUS processes text sequentially, first strippin goff the document header, then identifying sentences, which are processed syntactico-semanticallyone at a time, after which all the results are passed to the discourse component .Figure 4 shows the raw, unprocessed text of the first sentence (Si), followed by its lexica lanalysis .
Each word has one or more senses, represented as a root symbol, which is generally theconcatenation of the English token, the "^" character, and the PAKTUS lexical category (e .g .
,"Condemn^Monotrans"), or as a simple structure involving a root, lexical category, inflectionalmark, and sometimes a conceptual derivation (e .g.
the structure "(Condemn^Monotrans L^Effect-mark Base C^It-got)" represents the adjective sense of "condemned") .
For each word, all sensesin the PAKTUS lexicon are fetched or derived at this time ; disambiguation is generally delayeduntil the syntactic and semantic phases .R-A GEN TR" INST RDOERR'FOCUS\R PURPOS ER -MAT ER IA I .R -ATTRIBUTER"OPPONENT -E <R"OPPOSITIO NPROP-ROLEER R"ORIGINR"SOURCE <R"DONORR"DES TR"RECIPIENTR-WIZE NR"TIME R FINISHR'DURATIONR"WHEN-ADVR"MANNERR"BENEFICIARYR"METHODR'CAUS ER"ACCOMPLIC ER"POSSESSEDR -PRECONDITIO NR - TOO LR" PLA CPUR OSER"CO-EVEN TR"LOC.. ,R"GOALR"AFFECTEDR"EXPERIENC ER'12 COMPANIONR"RESUL TRf EVEN TR'OBJEC TREFFECTR"PROPOSI TR EXTEN TFt-PLACE R"PATH<R"MEDWMR"CO-CONMODAL-ROL E255*** raw sentence :SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI CONDEMNED TH ETERRORISTKILLING OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO AN DACCUSED THEFARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) OF TH ECRIME .

Lexical Analysis of the First Sentence of Test2 Document Number 48The syntactic and conceptual analyses of this sentence are shown in Figure S .
Note thatconceptual structures are produced for some nouns (notably here, "killing"), not just for verbs .These conceptual structures are essential to the overall task of information extraction ; if no caseframes are produced for a sentence (i .e ., the syntactico-semantic analysis failed), it is completelyignored by the discourse analysis and extraction processes .The syntactic analysis produced for Si is a configuration of syntactic registers (the main one sare shown in the figure) and register fillers .
In this case, the main clause has a Main-Ver b(condemned), Subject (the NP whose Head is Cristiani), and Direct Object (the terrorist killin gNP).
The conjoined clause ("and accused the FMLN .
.
.")
was correctly parsed, and its gap (noexplicit Subject) has been filled in with the Subject of the main clause .PAKTUS produced four case frames for S1, one for each of the two clauses, one for the"killing" NP and one for the "crime" NP .This conceptual analysis will enable the discourse analysis module to determine that "the crime "refers to "the killing" because 1) both are topic objects (as fillers of Focus roles), 2) "crime's "concept CAAGGR is a generalization of "the killing's" concept of CAKILL in the PAKTUSconceptual network, and 3) "crime" appears in a subordinate clause (all three conditions arerequired for this reference resolution) .Determining that the crime refers to the killing here is important ; it enables PAKTUS toidentify the FMLN as the accused perpetrator of Alvarado's killing .
It can also determine that theaccusation is made by an authority (president-elect Cristiani), thanks to the gap filling by th esyntactic analysis.256The second sentence (S2 )contains the phrase "Merino alsodeclared that the death of theAttorney General .
.
."
whichPAKTUS recognizes as referring tothe killing in Si, so this phrase isconsolidated into the same topicstructure.
Merino is not, however,a topic object, since he is in theAgent role, which is not a topicrole.
This is important, becaus elater in the text there is a report of aguerrilla attack on Merino's home.Merino is a topic object there .
Thathe is not a topic object in S2 enablesPAKTUS to recognize this laterpassage as a different topic .The complete filled templates forthis article are shown in Figure 6(the ordering of the templates i simmaterial) .
They contain almost allof the information that should havebeen extracted .
The only missin ginformation is "no injury" to abodyguard in template 2 .
Also, thecity in which one incident (fill 2 )occurred is incorrectly reported, anda "terrorist" perpetrator is reportedredundantly in fill 2 .n70Taox0Elor w nZNyo(nCIW0420nto0TItl~~byt /AN ''A71wyjt'wT Tg06 Z'sf M w`.'"

Syntactic and Conceptual Analysis of S iOne item missing from template1, compared to the official answerkey, is the FMLN as theperpetrating organization.
Nowherein the text is it stated or implied thatthe FMLN attacked Merino's home,however.
Much of the MUC-4-specific knowledge that would beencoded in conceptual patterns toidentify information in topicstructures to be extracted in th etemplate fills, was not entered int oPAKTUS, due to our developmenttime and effort limits .
The fillsshown include some information(underlined in the figure) derivedwith minor enhancements that weremade after the official test run forMUC-4, specifically, the addition o fthree conceptual patterns, correction of a minor error in the output specification of another one, an dcorrecting a lexicon entry to mark "vehicle's" type as "transport vehicle ."257S.
