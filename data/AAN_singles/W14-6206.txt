As part of digi-tal access and information retrieval on heritage databases it is becoming increasingly importantthat date descriptors are not matched as strings but that their semantics are properly understoodand interpreted by man and machine alike.
This paper describes a prototype system designedto resolve temporal expressions from English language cultural heritage records to ISO 8601compatible date expressions.
The architecture we advocate calls for a two stage resolution witha ?semantic layer?
between the input and ISO 8601 output.
The system is inspired by a similarsystem for German language records and was tested on real world data from the National Galleryof Ireland in Dublin.
Results from an evaluation with two senior art and metadata experts fromthe gallery are reported.1 IntroductionPreserving a memory of past events has been central to human culture for millennia and may even beseen as a defining element of cultural life in general.
The practice of specifying locations in time for thispurpose transcends cultural boundaries.
The earliest precursors of the Chinese lunisolar calendar can betraced back to the second millennium before Christ.
In ancient Attica the ?eponymous archon?
lent hisname to the year he ruled in and a similar system was employed by republican Romans.
The introductionof the Julian calendar and its Georgian reform, although haphazardly adopted, has eventually led to awidely accepted standard for locating events in time (although alternative calendars exist and thrive tothis day).
The advent of the computer age has brought with it stricter requirements for such standards, forinstance that of unambiguous machine readability.
A number of such standards for encoding the meaningor extension of temporal expressions have emerged in recent years (ISO 8601, TimeML, VRA core).However, legacy records in the field of cultural heritage still abound with natural language descriptionsof dates and date ranges that are not expressed in a standardised form, such as "around 1660", "late15th century", "1720-30 (?)".
The non-standard nature of such expressions is compounded by inherentuncertainty about the dates which is expressed through uncertainty markers such as "around", "(?)"
orsimilar.
While human experts have little difficulty interpreting such expressions these are not amenableto machine-based processing and thus are not directly useful for querying databases based on dates, forinstance.
The latter purpose is much better served by date ranges with a clear beginning and end.We argue for conceptually splitting the process of ?translating?, ?converting?
or otherwise associatinginformal descriptions of dates with concrete date ranges with an unambiguous beginning and end.
A firststep should capture the semantics of the original expression including possible uncertainty markers withas little loss in meaning as possible.1The target of this step should be a language independent ontologyor semantic standard, such as the VRA core 4.0 date element.
A second step should then map from aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

is essentially that in a first step uncertainty markers should be kept (albeitin a standardized form) rather then resolved to a date range (i.e.

The system is inspired bya similar system for German language records and was tested on real life data from the National Galleryof Ireland in Dublin and evaluated by two senior art and metadata experts from the gallery.
The defaultrules for converting the ?meaning?
of date expressions to date ranges were found to be superior to theheuristics currently configured by the National Gallery in their collection management system.2 BackgroundThe National Gallery of Ireland (NGI) has developed a set of in-house standards for cataloguing dateexpressions related to the creation of artworks (Appendix A and B).
These standards complement theeditorial guidelines outlined in the NGI house style guide for works of art in the collection and they mustbe applied when entering the data into the relevant field on TMS2(The Museum System), the collectionmanagement system used by the Gallery.
These guidelines have been created based on best practicestandards for cataloguing date expressions.
There are several authoritative resources that institutions canconsult to draft their own in house cataloguing standards, including date format and epoch descriptors:AAT3(Art & Architecture Thesaurus), CDWA4(Categories for the Description of Works of Art) or theAAE Style Guide5(Association of Art Editors Style Guide), to mention just a few.As shown in Appendix A and B, the NGI standards cover a diverse set of date expressions, fromspecific dates to more generic ones, giving the opportunity to enter into the system a range of years,decades or centuries.
The date values are expressed as four digit years.
More specific dates related toother events connected to the creation of the art work (for example for published volumes or differentprint editions), are recorded in the ?Historical Dates field?
where the required date can be selected froma pop up calendar and the type of date can be selected from a drop down list (for example ?Published?
).The Date label on TMS consists of three main fields: Date, which displays the actual date or range ofdates related to the creation of the art work and which appears on the main object record screen as partof the basic object tombstone information; Begin Date and End Date, which represent the earliest andthe latest possible years from a range of dates during which the artwork was created (Fig.
1).
The BeginDate and End Date are not displayed in the Date label on the data entry screen of a record, as they areused for indexing and searching purposes only.
Through the Simple Search and the Advanced Searchfunctionality in the system it is possible to retrieve records with a range of dates, by either searching forearliest date, latest date or a certain time between these dates, the resulting records being drawn from thevalues recorded in the Begin and End Date.

The suggestions can be accepted or modified manuallyand then saved.
A date expression can also be suggested by the system when entering the relevant yearsdirectly into Begin and End Date.
In this case the ?Calc?
button prompts a pop up window with differentdate expressions based on the years inserted as beginning and end.
For example, by entering ?1575?
and?1578?
in the Begin and End Date, the suggestion box for the Date field will list the following options:?1575-1578?
; ?c.1576?
; ?late 16th century?.
When date ranges include two specific years (for example inthe case of ?YYYY/YYYY?
or ?YYYY-YYYY?)
the two year values are automatically suggested in theBegin and End Date fields.
When a single year is inserted in the Date field, the Begin and End Date areautomatically filled with that same year value.Through the configuration menu it is possible to specify the range of years to be ?suggested?
in theBegin and End Date when entering a particular date expression in the Date field.
By default this appliesfor the circa label (in the NGI case the range is 5 years before and after the specified date) and decades.Although the automatic suggestions for Begin and End Date are configurable through the back end ofthe system, manual input is still necessary for accuracy when entering certain date expressions.
Centuriesfor example (in all their formats, from ?xxth century?
to ?early/mid/late xxth century?)
are not recognizedby Begin and End Date, which in these cases need to be filled in manually.
However the process worksin reverse: when inserting the correct earliest and latest year that indicate a century span, the suggestionbox for the Date field displays different options, including the correct ?xxth century?
format.On the other hand, in the case of decades, the relevant Begin Date and End Date are correctly suggestedwhen inserting the ?YYYYs?
format in the Date field, while, when entering the relevant years indicatingthe time span of a decade in the Begin and End date, the options listed as suggestions for the Date field donot include the correct format, giving instead the option of selecting ?YYYY-YYYY?
as an alternative.Similarly the Date field does not distinguish between years separated by an ?or?, a dash or a hyphenwhen displaying the suggestions based on years inserted in Begin and End Date: when two differentyears are inserted in the Begin and End Date, the only relevant option listed by the system is the rangeof years separated by a hyphen.
However, when entering the same date expressions in the Date fieldwhether separated by ?or?, dash or hyphen, the correct values are inserted in the Begin and End Date.As the Date field is a free-text field on TMS, the process of manually entering date values, especiallythe ones that indicate uncertainty and include a prefix and non-numerical values, gives more room forerror.
In addition to this, not every date expression inserted in the Date field is recognised by the Beginand End Dates, in which case these also have to be entered manually.At the same time the automatic suggestions given for the Date field when entering Begin Date and Endseem to be more comprehensive and work better and they are helpful in giving the opportunity to selectthe correct option without having to manually enter the data, thus reducing the possibility of error.
In thecase of the NGI some configuration is further needed to make the most of the automated system alreadyin place.
In particular it would be useful to include in the provided suggestions for the Begin and EndDate, those date expressions that are not currently recognised by the system.3 Methodology and data setThe development of our system is inspired by an earlier system of temporal expression resolution forGerman language date expressions, an auxiliary part of a research project concerned with informationretrieval on digital repositories of works of art, (Isemann and Ahmad, 2014).
The approach was aniterative development cycle of successively resolving ever more complex date and time descriptors andmapping them to unambiguous time spans in ISO 8601 format.
The data used were German date entriesin a commercially available digital collection of 40,000 works of art.6Example expressions from thisdata set are: ?1707-1712?, ?1734/39?, ?1790-3?, ?12./13.
Jh.
?, ?1.
Drittel 16.
Jh.
?, ?1420-1375 v.
Chr.
?.These examples represent date ranges that have a fairly well defined beginning and end.
One mayperhaps argue whether the 13th century should include the year 1300 or not, but in general the intended6The DVD collection ?40000 Meisterwerke?, published by Directmedia Publishing.43boundaries are reasonably clear.
The following examples, however, are compounded by the fact that theycontain uncertainty markers which leave the precise date range that should be assigned to them up tocontext and interpretation: ?um 1568?, ?1642 (?
)?, ?Vor 1650?, ?ab 1486?, ?nach 1776-77?.For the experiments presented here, we obtained a similar although much smaller English languagedata set from the National Gallery of Ireland.
The data consisted of 939 records from the NGI database,comprising date expressions such as ?1791 to 1794?, ?1870/72?, ?1740s?, ?18th century?, ?1st February1751?, ?
?c.1893?, ?after 1752?, ?late 16th century?, ?mid-1930s?.
Unlike in the German data set, mostdate expressions in the NGI data are already associated with a ?Begin Date?
and ?End Date?
either calcu-lated by the NGI collection management system or manually entered by NGI staff (compare Section 2).These date ranges sanctioned by art experts present a valuable additional resource which may serve astraining data for statistical learning or as a benchmark to compare against.In contrast to the German language system we are conceptually using a two stage approach in whichwe first attempt to represent the intended meaning of a date expression (?intension?)
and only then mapit to a date range for search and retrieval (one might call this range the ?extension?
of a date expression).For the representation of date expression semantics (intension) we have chosen the VRA core 4.0 set ofmetadata elements and here in particular the ?date?
element.7VRA core is a set of categories defined andmaintained by the Data Standards Committee of the Visual Resources Association.8The latest version4.0 dates from 2007.
The standard has been used for semantic annotation (cf.
Hollink et al.
(2003) whichuse VRA core 3.0) and defines mappings to other metadata schemata, such as Dublin Core,9CDWA,10CCO11(Cataloging Cultural Objects) and its own predecessors (VRA core 2.0 and 3.0).
As value rangesthe standard recommends widely used thesauri (AAT12) or controlled vocabularies (ULAN13) or in thecase of dates the ISO 8601 standard.
Structurally, the standard prescribes that ?date?
elements have a?type?
attribute (such as ?creation?, ?design?, ?alteration?)
and may have an ?earliestDate?
and ?latestDate?subelement, both of which should only take ISO 8601 compatible values and can be modified by aboolean ?circa?
attribute.The semantic representation is the point of departure for the resolution of a date expression to a con-crete date range.
This leaves room for interpretation, especially in cases where a ?circa?
flag is present.Ideally this mapping should be governed by preferences at the user and/or institution level (similar to theguidelines presented in Appendices A and B).While the interpretation of these dates may vary on a case-by-case basis and even experts may disagree,we believe that certain default rules will allow at least a rough approximation of the intended time range inmany cases.
Analysing the data we noticed that mentions of years are not uniformly distributed in termsof the digit they end on.
Figure 2 shows the relative frequency of year end digits for the German data set(red line) in expressions involving a ?circa?
flag (German: ?um?).
Assuming a uniform distribution ofyears the frequencies should be 801.1 throughout.
It is statistically extremely unlikely that the observeddeviation from a uniform distribution is due to chance variation (chi squared test, 9 degrees of freedom,p < 0.001).
As it appears equally unlikely that artists over the centuries have had a particular propensityto be more productive in years ending in 0 and 5, we believe that the natural explanation is that arthistorians documenting temporality tend to gravitate to "round" numbers in cases of greater uncertainty.As an upshot we would like to suggest that all else being equal approximate dates involving years shouldbe seen as less certain if they end in 0 or 5 than if they end in other digits.
Accordingly we add ?10years to years ending in ?0?, ?5 to years ending in ?5?
and ?1 to years ending in other digits.

Here ?c(?)?

Note, that not all expressions which may informally appear vague involve a circa attributeand that we assign a latest date by default for cases such as ?after 1752?, contrary to the VRA corerecommendation (which we adopt as semantic representation for such cases).4 ExperimentsWe implemented a rule-based date expression resolver for the expressions in the English language Na-tional Gallery data set (achieving nearly complete coverage) with the set of heuristics outlined in theprevious section (cf.
Table 1).
Two art history and meta data experts from the National Gallery agreedto participate in an evaluation of the output of our resolution system compared against the current daterange entry in the National Gallery database.
The entries in the NGI database are not a direct feature ofthe collection management system, but rather of how the system is currently used.We observed that our system output agreed with the NGI entries in about half of the cases (58%).
Inorder not to burden our volunteers?
time too much we did not evaluate on the complete data set, but ona randomly extracted subset in which we only included cases where our system output differed fromthe existing gallery records.
We used a random number generator in Java to extract records until wereached a limit of 50 cases in which the two date interpretations were different.
This limit was reachedafter selecting a total of 104 entries.
The 50 non-trivial cases were compiled into a list comprised of theoriginal date expression and a choice of two different date ranges each, one from the NGI records andone from our system.
The order of the choices was randomized independently for each individual record.The two evaluation participants were given this list together with a short introductory text outliningthe background and purpose of the evaluation.
They were then instructed to select which of the twodate range alternatives they felt best captured the meaning of the date expression or indicate that theyhad no preference.
Introductory paragraphs in the evaluation stressed that while individual context maysometimes enter into such a decision, they should think of the given date expressions as generic examples.5 ResultsOf the 100 individual decisions made by our two experts (50 each) exactly half (50) were in favour ofour system?s default recommendation, less than a third were in favour of the existing database entry (29)45and just over one in five (21) had no particular preference (Table 2).Annotator AOur System Gallery Records No Preference Total Annotator BOur System 8 0 3 11Annotator B Gallery Records 19 2 6 27No Preference 12 0 0 12Total Annotator A 39 2 9Table 2: Agreement of preferences expressed by our evaluators in 50 test cases.While this may be seen as an encouraging result for our date range recommender system it has to besaid that in their overall preference our two evaluators were leaning different ways.
While one over-whelmingly agreed with our system recommendations (preferring the NGI alternative in just two caseswith nine ties), the other was leaning towards the NGI records (preferring our system in just eleven caseswith twelve ties).
Overall the two evaluators agreed in ten of the 50 cases (Cohen?s kappa = -0.048).We believe that the reason for the differing opinions between our two evaluators may be that oneof them is working closely with the NGI database and is therefore very familiar with the status quo,including certain agreed in-house standards.
The other evaluator, who was leaning towards the rulesimplemented in our system, is from the curatorial department and concerned with absolute and relativedating of works of art in a more theoretical way.
A more thorough evaluation is needed in order todetermine if the more flexible rules we are advocating would be appreciated by an expert user community.6 Related WorkThe resolution of temporal expressions is an important topic in the information extraction and semanticweb community and employing these methods on cultural heritage texts in particular has been the focusof research spanning these fields and the emergent discipline of digital humanities.Context-free grammars (CFG) for the resolution of temporal expressions have been employed by An-geli et al.
(2012) and Kauppinen et al.
(2010).
Angeli et al.
(2012) attempt to learn a probabilistic CFG fortime and date expressions and at the same time an expectation maximation framework for the resolutionof pragmatic ambiguity in time expressions (e.g.
?Friday?
may refer to last or next Friday, ?last Friday?may refer to the previous Friday or the Friday two weeks ago etc.).
For training their system they employthe TempEval-2 Task A dataset.14Despite the relatively small training set (1052 time expressions) theyreport comparable performance of their system with leading rule-based temporal resolvers.Kauppinen et al.
(2010) employ fuzzy sets towards the representation and querying of temporallydisputable periodic expressions from cultural heritage such as ?late-Roman-era?, ?Middle Ages?
or ?be-ginning of the 1st century BC?, which can vary due to subjectivity or lack of hard records.
They definea date span with a fuzzy beginning and end which encompasses the widest possible bounds for a tem-poral period and then a more concise beginning and end which encompasses more constrained bounds.Queries are matched against the fuzzy set using a bespoke querying model which finds the level of over-lap between the query and the fuzzy set.
They test their theories on a set of records from the AncientMilan15project, representing fuzzy date ranges as four RDF triples, one for each of the date points.
Theyrepresent definite temporal expressions such as First half of the 1st Century BC in Backus-Naur form.Research into frameworks for temporal expression extraction in the computational sciences, (Changand Manning (2012), Str?tgen and Gertz (2010), Sun et al.
(2013)) has tended to focus on domainssuch as clinical texts and newswire for developing temporal expression resolution systems.
We believe,however, that there is a clear and present need for systems and frameworks which can extract structuredinformation from cultural heritage text, particularly in the domain of fine art image catalogues.
Thesemethodologies can enable the development of smarter retrieval systems for catalogues of cultural history14Cf.

X, near the end of theX century and others.
They represent such indeterminacy using a four category classification of dateexpressions and a probabilistic approach from the TSQL2 standard, (Snodgrass et al.
(1994)).
Lilis andothers (2005) use multidimensional RDF in their representation of cultural artifacts in a museum setting.Smith (2002) focuses on detecting events in unstructured historical text with dates forming the mainfocus of his study.
The author investigates the co-occurrence of place names and dates in 19th century textand extracts a geo-located list of events from the text.
He mentions that 98% of numerical tokens in thetexts refer to dates, although in different text genres, date information may be more vaguely expressed.Furthermore, he finds that certain dates are expressed as a calendar day and others refer merely to the yearan event occurred.
These expressions can prove problematic for traditional date processing algorithms,and often a more complex mapping is required to convert these textual representations to a computationalformalism such as the CIDOC specification.
Chang and Manning (2012) focus on generic temporalexpressions with their SUTIME parser, which represents date and temporal information extracted fromtext using the TIMEX3 tag format from the TimeML (Boguraev and Ando (2005)) standard.An emerging trend in date resolution literature encompasses the big data paradigm.
Blamey et al.
(2013) develop a probabilistic approach toward modelling everyday natural language date expressions17using textual data from image descriptions and EXIF18data from uploaded photos on the flickr website.7 Conclusion and Future WorkWe have presented and tested a system specifically designed for the resolution of date expressions incultural heritage legacy records and we have argued for a ?semantic layer?
between the literal expressionsand the date range resolution.
Our evaluation, although small scale, suggests that such a system maypotentially be able to improve even records which already incorporate date resolutions, if slightly morecomplex rules than are contained in the current system or data entry guidelines are implemented.A number of possible lines of future work suggest themselves.
In order to arrive at an explicit localgrammar for ?heritage dates?
(cf.
Kauppinen et al.
(2010) and Angeli et al.
(2012)), we have created acontext-free grammar, that accepts roughly the same input as our current rule set.
Initial examinationsuggests that the non-lexical part of the grammar can cover both English and German language datagiven appropriate lexicons.
The grammar phrases can be mapped to representations in the semantic layerthereby in effect creating a system which could process multilingual input and produce consistent output.A further extension to the system would involve the processing of semantically more complex temporalperiod expressions, such as ?Victorian?, ?Edwardian?, ?Gr?nderzeit?, ?Gilded Age?
or ?Renaissance?.Examples tied to the reign of a monarch tend towards a more defined scope however wider-rangingand more culturally-disputed periods such as ?the Renaissance?
tend to attract a less precise beginningand end-date than the former examples and may require a more complex set of semantics.
Data-drivenapproaches could be employed to model the temporal boundaries for temporal expressions of a morevague nature.
Angeli et al.
(2012) demonstrate that this may be feasible even on relatively small datasets.Examples which could benefit from an ontological augmentation involving events and periods includethe practice of dating works of art with implicit reference to such periods based on a believed or pre-viously confirmed date for a major event such as a battle or war.
One example of this practice couldbe an artwork dated ?after 1453?, with the date actually representing the current dating of the fall ofConstantinople.
As historical information is updated or revised, the corresponding date range estimatingthe temporal origin of a work could be resolved based on updated information for the reference event.Similar suggestions were made in (Isemann and Ahmad, 2009).
Perhaps the practically most relevantexample of this kind could be cross-referencing the lifespan of an artist associated with the production16A geographical, physical and historical dictionary of Tuscany17Their work focuses on UK-specific cultural expressions such as Bonfire Night, first day of summer, Christmas holidays.18Timestamps saved by digital cameras.47of a work with the temporal expression for its creation: if the expression says ?after 1756?
but we haveconcrete knowledge that the artist died in 1758, this can be used to add bounds to the creation event.AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank Dr Adriaan Waiboer, curator for Northern European Art at the NationalGallery of Ireland, for valuable suggestions and his help in organising the expert evaluation.ReferencesGabor Angeli, Christopher Manning, and Daniel Jurafsky.
