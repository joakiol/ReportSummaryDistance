Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC)User Interface Technology, Code 441Principal Investigators:Steve NunnNancy HuppOBJECTIVES:1) Determine naval applications of DARPA-developed speech recognitiontechnology.2) Acquire speech databases as appropriate for evaluation of application tasks.3) Develop a speech testbed for the integration, testing, and evaluation speechrecognition technology.ACCOMPLISHMENTS:Collected the Task-Oriented, Naturally Elicited (TONE) speech database.This involved designing an experiment o elicit spontaneous peech fromnaval personnel performing a problem-solving task requiring database query.Developed software for subject interface and data collection.
A reportdescribing the experiment and data collection is in progress.PLANS:NOSC has identified the Battle Group Tactical Trainer (BGTT) as anappropriate candidate for the integration of speech recognition in the navy.Current plans are to record speech samples and create transcriptions from theBGTT exercises at NOSC and the Naval Post-Graduate School.
We will thenevaluate the recordings to determine appropriate tasks for speech recognition,and create a language model to describe the speech.
Following this, a speechdatabase will be collected for testing and evaluation.In addition, the long-term development of a speech testbed for theintegration, testing, and evaluation speech recognition technology willcontinue.196
