Rare Dialogue Acts Common in Oncology ConsultationsMary McGee Wood, Richard CraggsDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of ManchesterManchester M13 9PL U.K.mary, richard.craggs@cs.man.ac.ukIan Fletcher, Peter MaguirePsychological Medicine GroupUniversity of ManchesterStanley HouseManchester M20 4BX U.K.ian.fletcher, peter.maguire@cs.man.ac.ukAbstractDialogue Acts (DAs) which explicitly en-sure mutual understanding are frequentin dialogues between cancer patients andhealth professionals.
We present exam-ples, and argue that this arises from thehealth- critical nature of these dialogues.1 BackgroundWe have described elsewhere (Wood, 2001; Woodand Craggs, 2002) the use of dialogue analysis incommunication skills training for health profession-als working with cancer patients.
Our initial cor-pus arises from a study of Macmillan Cancer Carenurses undertaken by the Psychological MedicineGroup, University of Manchester, funded by theCancer Research Campaign.
It consists of 37 dia-logues between nurses and patients, each comprising200-1200 utterances (mostly 300-600).
The nurses?goal is to learn as much as possible about the pa-tients?
condition, both physical and mental, and toinform the patients about their condition and treat-ment.
The dialogues are thus genuine, naturally oc-curring conversations, but occurring in an unusual,highly significant and emotionally charged situation.We have not yet fully annotated a statisticallysignificant sample, but it is clear even from read-ing through the corpus that a group of themati-cally related DAs occur frequently which are rarein previously studied corpora such as Switchboard.These are DAs which explicitly establish or con-firm accurate mutual understanding, either factualor emotional, between the participants (collaborativecompletions, summaries), or which build rapportthrough courtesy and appreciation (thanks, apolo-gies).
Protracted closing sequences are charac-teristic, and tend to have elements of both.
Weinterpret these patterns as direct responses to thegoal-directed and potentially health-critical natureof these dialogues.2 Rare dialogue actsWe take as our point of comparison the corpus ofsome 200,000+ utterances from the Switchboardcorpus tagged with the SWBD-DAMSL tagset (Ju-rafsky et al 1998).
Of these, 36% are ?Statements?,19% ?Continuers?, and 13% ?Opinions?, giving atotal of 68% of all utterances in the three most com-mon categories.
At the other end of the scale, anoriginal tagset of 220 was reduced to 42 because therarity of many made statistical analysis impossible.Even of these 42, 32 occur with less than 1% fre-quency, 25 less than 0.5%.
Four of the five DAs wewill discuss here are among these last 25.2.1 Mutual understandingThe first goal of the nurse in these dialogues is to as-certain the subjectively perceived physical conditionof the patient, which reflects the success of previ-ous treatment, and suggests directions for the future.Factual accuracy is clearly essential if future treat-ment is to be appropriate.
It is also seen as importantthat the patient have accurate knowledge of his / hercondition and treatment.Secondly, the nurse is trying to elicit the mental/ emotional state of the patient, and any particularconcerns or worries he or she has.
Although this isa somewhat different type of mutual understanding,the same DAs - collaborative completions andPhiladelphia, July 2002, pp.
196-200.
Association for Computational Linguistics.Proceedings of the Third SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue,summaries - can effect both.Collaborative completionsCollaborative completions are rare in mostdialogue types, where they would probably be seenas pre-emptive interruptions.
(The SWBD/ DAMSLcorpus includes 699/ 205,000, about 0.3%.)
Here,however, they are supportive, and relatively com-mon.
We have identified recurring patterns of bothfactual and emotional use.a.
Factual completions: commonly, the patient isnot sure of the name of (e.g.)
a drug or procedure,and hesitates, whereon the nurse provides it:P20 This is the, this is the ones I?m taking there.N21 Right.P21 Deta,N22 Dexamethasone.
(017-166)P5 MST and,N6 Antibiotics.P6 Antibiotics and then by Sunday morning I hadcome round a bit because all I did was sleep.
(038-395)Sometimes the need for information is made ex-plicit (here - as in the rest of the article - names havebeen changed to maintain confidentiality):P49 I did ask the Registrar, I forget his name Mr,Mr Ferguson?s Registrar, I don?t, I forget his name.N50 Birch, Mr Birch?P50 That?s right, that?s the one.
(047-291)The same effect is also often achieved through anovert question, more often on the part of the nurse:N133 And the tablets that you take, the capsulesthat you?ve just taken now?P134 They?re Tylex, they?re a painkiller but I don?t,I mean I don?t take them all the time they?re justpurely as a little top up.
(035-215)b.
Emotional completions: the patient may bestruggling to find the right words, or reluctant to talkabout something.
The nurse is showing understand-ing and empathy with the patient, and encouraginghim/her to continue the conversation:P80 : But that?s the sort of feeling I get a,N81 : A tiredness.
(042-277)P328b But it?s not until it happens to you that,N329 That sudden impact of gosh.P329 That?s it.
(024-113)P162 I could feel the panic coming in me and beforethe operation definitely but I?m,N163 You?re okay.
(057-356)SummariesThe SWBD/ DAMSL ?summarize/reformulate?DA would seem laboured and unnatural in mosttypes of conversation, and indeed their corpusincludes only 919/ 205,000, about 0.5%.
In ourdomain, however, it is an entirely natural and usefulway of checking correct mutual understanding,factual or emotional.a.
Repetition: simple repetition signals to the firstspeaker that the second has heard and understood:N297 I would have no problem in recommendingthat you go from the 50 to the 75.P298 Yes to the 75.
(035-215)The first speaker, on the other hand, may repeat in-formation if the second appears not to have under-stood (note the use of a collaborative completion inthis example):P56 : 0 to 10, it went down then to about three....N59 : So it went down to,P59 : It went down to three.
(042-277)This sequence shows both patterns:R128 Well she?s on 50mg of,P129 Durogesic.N129 Fifty?R129 Durogesic, fifty yes.N130 Fifty right.
(035-215)Where there is no apparent problem over informa-tion, repetition suggests encouragement to continuethe conversation on that topic:157 And you get very dizzy don?t you.N158 That?s been an additional problem hasn?t itthat dizziness.R158 The dizziness.
(016-128)b.
Summary / paraphrase: a simple summary asksfor confirmation that the speaker has understood thepreceding dialogue correctly.
Repetition may beused to express the confirmation:N25 : Mmmm.
So yesterday you were sick twice.P25 : Twice.
For the first and only time.
(042-277)Summaries can also be used to bring the conversa-tion back on track after a digression.
The nurse mayinitially wish to pursue a digression, in case it leadsto the revealing of a concern, but also needs to keepthe conversation focussed and ensure its goals aremet within an acceptable length of time:P132 : I mean, and the parent, their separatedparents, I think it?s dreadful.N133 : But I can also hear that, that from whatyou?re saying you?re cross with, with being ne-glected maybe for five hours or not having theback-up ... (042-277)N140 : Right.
But coming back to what you weresaying earlier about, I?ve lost my frame of thought,you mentioned earlier about wanting to makesure that you get the right information, that it isconsistent.
(042-277)All these examples have been factual, but summariesare also used to show empathy and understanding ofmental or emotional states:P425 There?s nothing really honestly, if I took to mybed or depended on someone.N426 Right.P426 That would be the end, oh it would.N427 Your control, your independence.P427 Yes, that?s more important to me at the minute.N428 You want to stay really in the security of yourown home.P428 Yes.
(024-113)2.2 ?Social glue?The dialogues in our corpus are not only moreimportant than most, they also occur in a complexwider context.
The nurse is part of an organisationwhich is trying to save the patient?s life, using treat-ments with painful, embarrassing, and depressingside-effects.
Everyone involved has more than usualto be thankful or sorry for.
Emotions run high.
Atthe same time, the whole enterprise depends on trustand cooperation.
Explicit courtesy, consideration,and appreciation are essential ?social glue?.
Nowonder that thanks and apologies, both barelyrepresented in SWBD/DAMSL, are common here.ThanksThanks occur only 67 times in SWBD/DAMSL,probably not enough to be statistically recognised asa separate tag, but clearly signalled lexically:N115 Alright then.P115 Right.
Thank you very much.
(027-334)In our corpus, the nurse thanks the patient withsurprising frequency (even ignoring the artificialcases of thanking the patient for allowing the con-versation to be recorded).
These seem to be part ofa general pattern of positive attitude and encourage-ment:N6 So thanks for doing this Karen, I just wantedto come down and see you this morning because Iknow we changed your medication a couple of daysago.
(027-334)P80 So I?ve been doing, I?ve done everything you?vesaid and it?s working so far.N81 Oh you?re wonderful, you?re wonderful, thankyou very much that?s really kind.
(024-113)Sometimes it is hard to draw a clear line betweenthanks and appreciation:N199 Is there anything you?d like to ask me?P199 Mmmm no I think you?ve been very kind andhelpful.
(030-318)P204 But apart from that I?ve had some excellenthelp and advice this year and from this week andfrom the nurses, all nursing staff.N205 Right.P205 They?ve been excellent.N206 Good, good.P206 And it?s very helpful to your recovery.N207 That?s good...P207 Very helpful.
(042-277)ApologiesApologies are similar to thanks (76 inSWBD/DAMSL).
Typically the nurse is reas-suring the patient of her interest and attention,perhaps after an interruption or some seemingoversight:N1 So go on I?m sorry to have interrupted you butit was just that she had to get out.
So it?s numb andyou can?t, (031- 198)N105 Barbara I?m sorry I didn?t check out howyou are in here, how are you in this room, is thatalright?
(057- 356)N208 Bearing in mind there are a lot of questions Iget asked that I can?t give the answers to.P209 Yes.N209 I?m afraid, but I?ll come and see you nextweek.
(063-489)Apologies can also be indirect or implicit:(after talking about problems)P314 ...poor girl you?ve got to listen to all that ...(06-017)2.3 Closures?Conventional-closing?
is the tenth most frequenttag in SWBD/DAMSL (although still only 1%(2486/ 205,000)).
Our corpus is distinguished notso much by the frequency as the nature of closures.The evidence is incomplete, as in many dialoguesthe tape runs out or is switched off before the end,but typically the closure of a dialogue is long, andexplicitly negotiated.
The nurse makes it clear tothe patient that the conversation is ending, in a waywhich does not leave the patient feeling cut off orabandoned (the imminent arrival of lunch is oftengiven as a reason):N131 Alright then.
I?ll cut it short so you can haveyour lunch.
(018-168)Expressions of thanks and/or appreciation are com-mon:N114 Right, I wouldn?t envy you that job, youhave loads of problems with Councils.
Shall we letCharlotte back in?P114 Yes, yes, yes.N115 And then we?ll be able to have, we?ll see whatshe has to do, you can fill the forms in because itwill be getting towards lunch time anyway, whattime is your lunch here?P115 Oh usually about now.N116 Right I?ll swap over and let Charlotte in ...thanks very much that was brilliant.
(025-153)We often find a series of summarising statementswithin a closing sequence:N160 No.
Right well I?ll see if there?s anything Ican do about that then and I?ll pop back next weekbut give me a ring in the meantime if there?s anyproblems.
I?ll speak to Dr Clarke and see what hethinks about this pain in your back.P161 Yes.N161 And see if there?s anything else that we can,bearing in mind you?ve only been on the MSTproperly for a short time.P162 Mmmm.N162 It might, we?ll just have to see how that works.P163 Its not too bad today is my back.N163 Right.
Anyway I?ll pop in next week.P164 Yes.N164 And, you know, just monitor how things aregoing and how you?re managing.
Alright?P165 Yes.
(020-139)N107 Have a great weekend.P107 Yes.N108 And we?ll catch up with you.P108 Yes.N109 Either in person or on the phone.P109 Right.N110 Next week when we know what else is hap-pening.P110 Okay.N111 Other than that we?ll actually now step back.P111 Right, yes, yes.N112 Unless you need us for anything specific.P112 Okay well I know where you are.N113 Because you?re back in the hands of,P113 Just the medical team.N114 That?s right yes for your treatment.P114 Yes, yes.N115 Alright then.P115 Right.
Thank you very much.N116 Okay see you soon.P116 Yes, yes.N117 Shall I walk you back down?P117 Right thank you, I?m not quite straight yet butI?m getting there.
(027-334)Both participants seem to be taking their last oppor-tunity to check that mutual understanding is com-plete.
Sometimes contact details are given or newtopics arise at this point:N558 Oh, I?ll finish off now anyway.
(023-111)The tape runs out at P604, after some repetition ofearlier topics and some new ones.3 AnalysisCancer care dialogues are health-critical.
Misunder-standings in casual conversation are unlikely to havedire consequences: here, they easily could.
Bothparticipants need to be unusually clear, and to ensurethat the clarity is mutual.
This results in an unusualpredominance of DAs which establish and monitormutual understanding, both factual and emotional.These dialogues are also emotionally charged, andare eased by explicit appreciation and courtesy.
(Formal design of patterns to ensure clarity in dia-logues can be found in safety-critical situations suchas military command and aviation.
The use of repe-tition to check and confirm understanding is charac-teristic of Air Traffic Control:Tower: BA117 descend 3,000 feet QNH 1017.Pilot: Descend 3,000 feet QNH 1017, BA117.Our dialogues are at the other end of the scale foropenness and unpredictability: it is interesting to seesimilar surface devices used for the same purpose insuch different environments.
)These findings are somewhat impressionistic, andtaken from a relatively small corpus.
As soon aswe have analysed a larger sample in more detail,it will be possible to verify and quantify these pat-terns, and to analyse the linguistic characteristics ofDAs which have previously eluded us.
Also, furthercomparisons can then be made with other corporaand previous work on dialogue analyses.AcknowledgementsAppreciation for their support of this research goesto Manchester University Computer Science Depart-ment for funding Richard Craggs and Cancer Re-search UK for funding Ian Fletcher.ReferencesDaniel Jurafsky, Elizabeth Shriberg, Barbara Foxand Traci Curl.
