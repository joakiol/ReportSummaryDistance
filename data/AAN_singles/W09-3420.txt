Based on the PrincetonWordNet, we develop a method in generatinga WordNet by using an existing bi-lingual dic-tionary.
We align the PWN synset to a bi-lingual dictionary through the English equiva-lent and its part-of-speech (POS), automati-cally.
Manual translation is also employed af-ter the alignment.
We also develop a web-based collaborative workbench, called KUI(Knowledge Unifying Initiator), for revisingthe result of synset assignment and provide aframework to create Asian WordNet via thelinkage through PWN synset.1 IntroductionThe Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbuam,1998) is one of the most semantically rich Eng-lish lexical banks widely used as a resource inmany research and development.
WordNet is agreat inspiration in the extensive development ofthis kind of lexical database in other languages.It is not only an important resource in imple-menting NLP applications in each language, butalso in inter-linking WordNets of different lan-guages to develop multi-lingual applications toovercome the language barrier.
There are someefforts in developing WordNets of some lan-guages (Atserias and et al, 1997; Vossen, 1997;Farrers and et al, 1998; Balkova and et al, 2004;Isahara and et al, 2008).
But the number of lan-guages that have been successfully developedtheir WordNets is still limited to some activeresearch in this area.
This paper, however, is theone of that attempt.This paper describes semi-automatic construc-tion of Thai WordNet and the applied method forAsian WordNet.
Based on the Princeton Word-Net, we develop a method in generating aWordNet by using an existing bi-lingual diction-ary.
We align the PWN synset to a bi-lingualdictionary through the English equivalent and itspart-of-speech (POS), automatically.
Manualtranslation is also employed after the alignment.We also develop a web-based collaborativeworkbench, called KUI (Knowledge UnifyingInitiator), for revising the result of synset as-signment and provide a framework to createAsian WordNet via the linkage through PWNsynset.The rest of this paper is organized as follows:Section 2 describes how we construct the ThaiWordNet, including approaches, methods, andsome significant language dependent issues ex-perienced along the construction.
Section 3 pro-vides the information on Asian WordNet con-struction and progress.
And Section 4 concludesour work.2 Thai WordNet Construction Proce-dureDifferent approaches and methods have beenapplied in constructing WordNet of many lan-guages according to the existing lexical re-sources.
This section describes how Thai Word-Net is constructed either approach or method.1392.1 ApproachesTo build language WordNet from scratch, twoapproaches were brought up into the discussion:the merge approach and the expand approach.The merge approach is to build the taxonomiesof the language; synsets and relations, and thenmap to the PWN by using the English equivalentwords from existing bilingual dictionaries.The expand approach is to map or translate lo-cal words directly to the PWN's synsets by usingthe existing bilingual dictionaries.Employing the merge approach, for Thai as anexample, we will completely get synsets and re-lations for the Thai language.
But it is time andbudget consuming task and require a lot ofskilled lexicographers as well, while less timeand budget is used when employing the expandapproach to get a translated version of WordNet.But some particular Thai concepts which do notoccur in PWN will not exist in this lexicon.Comparing between these two approaches, theThai WordNet construction intended to followthe expand approach by this following reasons;z Many languages have developed theirown WordNet using the PWN as amodel, so we can link Thai lexical data-base to those languages.z The interface for collaboration for otherlanguages can be easily developed.2.2 MethodsAs presented above, we follow the expand ap-proach to construct the Thai WordNet by trans-lating the synsets in the PWN to the Thai lan-guage.
Both automatic and manual methods areapplied in the process.2.2.1 Automatic Synset AlignmentFollowing the objective to translate the PWN toThai, we attempted to use the existing lexicalresources to facilitate the construction.
We pro-posed an automatic method to assign an appro-priate synset to a lexical entry by considering itsEnglish equivalent and lexical synonyms whichare most commonly encoded in a bi-lingual dic-tionary.
(Charoenporn 2008; Sornlertlamvanich,2008).WordNet (synset) TE Dict (entry)total Assigned total assignedNoun 145,103 18,353(13%)43,072 11,867(28%)Verb 24,884 1,333(5%)17,669 2,298(13%)Adjective 31,302 4,034(13%)18,448 3,722(20%)Adverb 5,721 737(13%)3,008 1,519(51%)Total 207,010 24,457(12%)82,197 19,406(24%)Table 1.
Synset assignment to entries inThai-English dictionaryFor the result, there is only 12% of the totalnumber of the synsets that were able to be as-signed to Thai lexical entries.
And about 24% ofThai lexical entries were found with the Englishequivalents that meet one of our criteria.
Table 1shows the successful rate in assigning synsets tothe lexical entry in the Thai-English Dictionary.Considering the list of unmapped lexical entry,the errors can be classified into three groups, asthe following.1.
The English equivalent is assigned in acompound, especially in case that thereis no an appropriate translation to repre-sent exactly the same sense.
For exam-ple,L: ???????????
raan3-khaa3-pleek1E: retail shop2.
Some particular words culturally used Ione language may not be simply trans-lated into one single word sense in Eng-lish.
In this case, we found it explainedin a phrase.
For example,L: ????????
kan0-jeak1E: bouquet worn over the ear3.
Inflected forms i.e.
plural, past partici-ple, are used to express an appropriatesense of a lexical entry.
This can befound in non-inflection languages suchas Thai and most of Asian languages,For example,L: ????????
raaw3-ra0-thom0E: greivedBy using this method, a little part of PWN hasbeen translated into Thai.
About 88% of the totalnumber of the synsets still cannot be assigned.Manual step is therefore applied.1402.2.2 Manual ConstructionHuman translation is our next step for synsettranslation.
Two important issues were taken intodiscussion, when starting the translation process.Those are;?
How to assign or translate new conceptsthat still do not occur in the Thai lexicon.Compound word or phrase is acceptableor not.?
Which equivalent do we need to consider,synset-to-synset equivalent or word-to-word equivalent?For the first issue, we actually intend to trans-late the PWN synsets into single Thai word only.But problems occurred when we faced with con-cept that has not its equivalent word.
For exam-ple,filly#1 -- (a young female horse under the ageof four)colt2#1 ?
(a young male horse under the ageof four)hog2#2, hogget#1, hogg#2 ?
(a sheep up tothe age of one year: one yet to be sheared)There is not any word that conveys the mean-ing of the above concepts.
That is because of thedifference of the culture.
In this case, phrase orcompound word will be introduced to use as theequivalent word of the concept.
This phenome-non always occurs with cultural dependent con-cept, technical terms and new concepts.As for the second issue, considering between(1) synset-to-synset equivalent assignment or (2)word-to-word equivalent assignment has to bediscussed.
Let consider the following concept of?dog?
in the PWN.dog#1, domestic dog#1, Canis familiaris#1 --(a member of the genus Canis (probably de-scended from the common wolf) that has beendomesticated by man since prehistoric times;occurs in many breeds; "the dog barked allnight")The above synset consists of three words; dog,domestic dog, and Canis familiaris.
The set ofThai synonyms that is equivalent to this Englishsynset is the following.Thai synset of ?dog?
{T1 ???
maa4 ?dog?
(normal word),T2 ?????
su1-nak3 ?dog?
(polite word),T3 ?????????
su1-nak3-baan0 ?domestic dog?,T4 ?????
???????????
kha0-nis3-fae0-mi0-lia0-ris3?Canis familiaris?
}These words have the same concepts but aredifferent in usage.
How do we choose the rightThai word for the right equivalent English word?It is a crucial problem.
In the paragraph below,three English words which represent the concept?dog?
are used in the different context and can-not be interchanged.
Similarly, T1, T2 and T3cannot be used substitutionally.
Because it con-veys different meaning.
Therefore, word-to-wordis our solution.
?...Dog usually means the domestic dog,Canis lupus familiaris (or "Canis familiaris" inbinomial nomenclature)....?Dog  T1 ???
maa4 ?dog?,T2 ?????
su1-nak3 ?dog?Domestic dog  T3 ????????
?su1-nak4-baan0?domestic dog?Canis familiaris T4 ?????
??????????
?kha0-nis3-fae0-mi0-lia0-ris3?Canis familiaris?Consequently, word-to-word equivalent isvery useful for choosing the right synonyms withthe right context.In conclusion, the main principle for the Eng-lish to Thai translation includes(1) ?Single word?
is lexicalized the existenceof concepts in Thai.
(2) ?Compound?
or ?Phrase?
is representedsome concepts that are not lexicalized inThai.
(3) Synset-to-synset equivalent is used forfinding Thai synset that is compatiblewith PWN synset.
(4) Word-to-word equivalent is used for find-ing the right Thai word that is compatiblewith PWN word in each synset.2.3 Language IssuesThis section describes some significant charac-teristics of Thai that we have to consider care-fully during the translation process.1412.3.1 Out of concepts in PWNThere are some Thai words/concepts that do notexist in the PWN, especially cultural-relatedwords.
This is the major problem we have tosolve during the translation.One of our future plans is to add synsets thatdo not exist into the PWN.2.3.2 Concept differentiationSome concepts in the PWN are not equal to Thaiconcepts.
For example, a synset {appear, comeout} represents one concept ?be issued or pub-lished?
in English, but meanwhile, it representstwo concepts in Thai, the concept of printed mat-ter, and the concept of film or movie, respec-tively.2.3.3 Concept Structure differentiationIn some cases, the level of the concept relationbetween English and Thai is not equal.
For ex-ample, {hair} in the PWN represents a conceptof ?a covering for the body (or parts of it) con-sisting of a dense growth of threadlike structures(as on the human head); helps to prevent heatloss; ??
but in Thai, it is divided into two con-cepts;T1 ??
khon4 ?hair?= ?hair?
that cover the bodyT2 ??
phom4 ?hair?= ?hair?
that cover on the human headThis shows the nonequivalent of concept.Moreover, it also differs in the relation of con-cept.
In PWN ?hair?
is a more general conceptand ?body hair?
is more specific concepts.
But inThai T1 ??
khon4 ?hair?
(hair that covers thebody) is more general concept and T2 ??
phom5?hair?
(hair that covers on the human head) ismore specific one.2.3.4 Grammar and usage differentiation?
Part of speech?
?Classifier?
is one of Thai POSwhich indicates the semanticclass to which an item belongs.It's widely use in quantitativeexpression.
For example, ???knon?
used with 'person', ?????lang?
used with house.?
Some adjectives in English, suchas ?beautiful?, 'red' and so on canfunction as the adjective and at-tribute verb in Thai.?
Social factors determining language us-age?
In Thai, some social factors,such as social status, age, or sexplay an important role to deter-mine the usage of language.
Forexample, these following threewords ???
kin0, ???
chan4 and ???
?sa0-waey4, having the samemeaning ?eat?, are used for dif-ferent social status of the listeneror referent.
These words cannotbe grouped in the same synsetbecause of their usage.3 From Thai to Asian WordNetAWN, or Asian WordNet, is the result of the col-laborative effort in creating an interconnectedWordNet for Asian languages.
Starting with theautomatic synset assignment as shown in section2, we provide KUI (Knowledge Unifying Initia-tor) (Sornlertlamvanich, 2006), (Sornlertlam-vanich et al, 2007) to establish an online col-laborative work in refining the WorNets.
KUI iscommunity software which allows registeredmembers including language experts revise andvote for the synset assignment.
The system man-ages the synset assignment according to the pre-ferred score obtained from the revision process.As a result, the community WordNets will beaccomplished and exported into the original formof WordNet database.
Via the synset ID assignedin the WordNet, the system can generate a crosslanguage WordNet result.
Through this effort, aninitial version of Asian WordNet can be fulfilled.3.1 Collaboration on Asian WordNetFollowings are our pilot partners in puttingthings together to make KUI work for AWN.?

Collaboration on Asian WordNet3.2 How words are linkedIn our language WordNet construction, lexicalentry of each language will be mapped with thePWN via its English equivalent.
On the processof mapping, a unique ID will be generated forevery lexical entry which contains uniquesense_key and synset_offset from PWN.
Exam-ples of the generated ID show in Table 2.
Whena word with a unique ID is translated into anylanguage, the same unique ID will be attached tothat word automatically.
By this way, the lexiconentry in the community can be linked to the eachother using this unique ID.Table 2.
Examples of the unique index withsense_key and synset_offset3.3 Progress on Thai WordNet and AsianWordNetThis section presents the progress on AsianWordNet and Thai WordNet construction.3.3.1 Current Asian WordNetAt present, there are ten Asian languages in thecommunity.
The amount of the translated synsetshas been continuously increased.
The currentamount is shown in the table 3.
As shown in thetable, for example, 28,735 senses from 117,659senses have been translated into Thai.Language Synset (s) % of total117,659sensesThai 28,735 24.422Korean 23,411 19.897Japanese 21,810 18.537Myanmar 5,701 4.845Vietnamese 3,710 3.153Indonesian 3,522 2.993Bengali 584 0.496Mongolian 424 0.360Nepali 13 0.011Sudanese 11 0.009Assamese 2 0.008Khmer 2 0.002Table 3.
