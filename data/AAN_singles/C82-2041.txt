We included ideas froma "semanti.clzsd" valence theory, a "semanticIzed" dependency~smmar ,  and l ingu is t i c  semant ics  in  genera l .We w i l l  now g ive  a shor t  descr ip t ion  o f  the  semant icnet  as  used  in  our  p ro jec t .
There  i s ,  a t  f i r s t ,  a h ie rarch ic -a l  " layer"  o f  concepts ,  cor respond ing  to  a categor ica l  the -saurus  sys tem.
Each  concept  i s  s t ruc tured  v ia  so -ca l ledro les  th rough other  concepts  and i t  i s  here  where the  lex ica lmean ings  f ind  the i r  p lace .
Ro les  e i ther  resemble  deep cases- 171  -in a case  grammar - so far, we have identified about 50 cases- or they are other vital "constituents'of the semantic con-cept to which they belong (e.g.
properties).
Whereas in thehlerarchioal "layer'the relations are those of hyponomy/hypero-moray, the relations which lead from concepts via roles toconceptual restrlotlons may be interpreted as relations ofsemant ic  compat ib i l i ty  ( se lec t iona l  res t r i c t ions ) ,  to  bespec i f ied .There  i s  no exp l i c i t  d ichotomy between syntax  and se -mant ics .
Syntax  i s  seen  as  a "coarse"  semant ic  (p re - )o rder ing- w i th  loopho les  wh ich  have  to  be br idged by t rans format ions .Each  concept  in  the  semant ic  net ,  inc lud ing  i t s  ro les  andconceptua l  res t r i c t ions ,  can ,  there fore ,  be  in terpreted  e i theras  a semant ic  de f in i t ion ,  o r  as  a semant ic  sentence  pat tern .The latter approach accounts for the applicability of a ?se-mantlcIzed" valence theory and a "semanticized'dependencygrammar.How do we apply this system to the problem of semanticcoherence in clauses and texts?
The first practical stepconsisted in olasslfylng the forms of semantic coherence andintegrating them into our system.
Accordingly, semantic coher-ence is expressed via1.
Proforms1.1.
Profornm which can be identified morphologically andmorphologlcally/syntactlcally1.1.1.
Purely morphologically: lexemes which can be identif-ied as proforms on a purely morphological basis (per-sonal pronouns, certain adverbial proforms).1.1.2.
Morpho log ica l ly / syntact i ca l ly :  lexemes  wh ich  can  beident i f ied  as  poss ib le  pro forms on a morpho log ica lbas i s  but  we need syntact i c  ev idence  fo r  the  dec is iono f  whether  they  rea l ly  a re  pro forms:  possess ive  pro -nouns  ( funct ion  as  pro forms on ly  when i so la ted  - non--a t t r ibut ive) ,  cer ta in  adverbs  wh ich  may a l so  funct -- 172  -i on  as con junct ions ,  cer ta in  in ter rogat ive  pronounswhich have the same morpho log ica l  shape as re la t ivepronotuls ?1 .2 ,1 ?
Border l ine  cases ,  border ing  on 1olo.
lexemes and syn-tagmas which cannot be ident i f ied  morpho log ica l ly / syn-tac t i ca l l y  as proforms, but of  which we know fromexper ience  that  they do ocouz as proforms:  Din~, tun.~eschehen, aus diesem Grund, e tc .1.2o2o Semantic proforms per  se:  th i s  group cons is ts  (mainly)of  "synonyms',  and, perhaps,  a l l  those lexemes whichstand in  a cer ta in  subconcept /superconcept  re la t ion  toone another ,  ee g .

Semantic coherence wi thout  proforms.
These are  de-monstrated best  b I an example: In(I) Das Haus gehoert mlr.
Leider ist das Dach(This is my house?
Unfortunately the roof issohon baufaelllg,in bad shape?
)we cannot apply any of the abovementioned olassiflcat-ion criteria, although it is obvious that semanticallyHaus and Dac_._~h belong together ?A f te r  having es tab l i shed  th i s  c lass i f i ca t ion  a mat r ixwas developed which cod i f ies  a l l  the ava i lab le  morpho log ica l~nd syntact i ca l  in fo rmat ion ,  p lus  in fo rmat ion  de l ivered  by theconcept - ro le  s t ruc ture  of the  net .
In  the matr ix  we f ind  In form-a t ion  such as whether a proform subst i tu tes  fo r  a noun phrase,a dependent c lause ,  an independent c lause ,  a text ,  an adverbe tc?
,  or  a combinat ion of  them, which prepos i t ion  to  expect  inan answer to a quest ion  us ing a spec i f i c  in ter rogat ive  pronoun,e tc ?I t  has a l ready  been es tab l i shed  (Hobbs 1978) that  thein fo rmat ion  conta ined in  the morpho log ica l - syntact i c  par t  ofthe matr ix  i s  not  su f f i c ient  to ident i fy  semant ic  coherence in- !73  -a c lause  or  text .
Even fo r  the  pro forms o f  1 .1 .
i t  i s  notsu f f i c ient  to  re ly  on the  gender  of  the  pre form to  f ind  thecor rect  antecedent .
In  the  exe~nple-(2) Der Fisch wird auf den Teller gelegt.
Dann esse ich lhn.
(The fish is put on the plate.
Afterwards I eat it.
)Identification via gender provides us with the informationthat either Fisc h or Teller may be the antecedent of lhn.Our concept-role structure, on the other hand, informs usthat - given ordinary circumstances - only fish are to beeaten, whereas plates are not.
This is to say that morpholog-ical and syntactical knowledge give us an indication where tolook for semantic coherence in a clause or text (syntax as"coarse* semantic (pre-) orderingl), but that we need criter-ia from the semantic net in order to be reasonably certainof what the proform stands for, or where semantic coherenceis to be found in case there are no proforms.A good example of how the system VIE-LANG works isdelivered by those syntagmatic adverbial proforms which standfor sentences or texts and which belong to 1.2.1.:(3) Das Restaurant ist heute geschlossen.
Aus diesem Grundessen wir zu Hause.
(The restauraunt is closed.
For thisreason we have dinner at home.
)On the semantic "surface" there is nothing which relatesGrund (reason) to anything else in either one of the twoclauses.
However, from our matrix we do know that aus diesemGrund may belong to 1.2.1 and, moreover, that its antecedentcan only be a main clause or a text which immediately p reced-es aus diesem G~do The system also recognizes that Restau-rant and essen belong to the same semantic neighborhood.
Thusit follows that Das Restaurant ist lheute geschlossen assumethe role +CAUSE with respect to essen wir zu Hause.From these examples it should be obvious that semanticcoherence according to 2, has to be based exclusively on the- 174  -concept-role structure of the net.
F.i., in example (1) se-mantic coherence can be made clear only when we know thatHau_~s and Dac...~h belong together semantically.
How can we achievethat?
Some scholars assume that a kind of inferencing guidesus from Hau_..~s to Dach.
In our system the lexeme "Haus" wouldbe connected  w i th  the  concept  BUILDING, in  which there  ex is tsa ro le  ROOF, which i s  the net -s t ruc ture  the  lexeme *Dech ?would lead  to .
