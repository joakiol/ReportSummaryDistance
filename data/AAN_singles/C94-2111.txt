'In order toprovide insighls into tile meaning and cfl'cclivcness of atext', stales Hall\[day (1985), 'a cliscourse granlmar needs1o be lil51ctionaI and semalHic in its orientation, with thegranunalical categories explained sis the real\[sat\[on fsemantic pattcrns'(xvii).
St,'(; provides this Ihnclional-senlanlic orientation.2.

An SFG analysis reveals 'howand wily' a lex\[ means what it does.

While l lalliday idenlilies the clause as I\[ICmost basic lexico-,prammalical 1Hlil, nevcrlhcless hc iily;t.}lecol,nises and includes in his grammar olhcr discomseIll/its besides tile clause.
I"or example, I I'alliday's notionof inlbrmalion ut/it in l:",nglish is similar to wh;ll '\['sao(I979) calls topic-chains in Chinese where a topicextends its scm:lnlic domain over several senie\]lcc?.3.

The outpul fronlthe parser will pennil certain fields lo be pre-set,lmplementalion of a bilingual version of the FSP willassist in the advancemenl of research into lhe similariliesand differences belwecn Chinese and English texlstructures.
While ttalliday lnai/llains thai file IhreeCOlllponelllS of meaning - -  ideational, interpersonal ndtextual --- are universal to all lang/lages, tile slruclurescorresponding 1o these COlllpol/ellls are, nevertheless,language specific.
Thus this bilingual implementation ftile FSP includes structures and fields relewmt toChinese and English.
Certainly there is some overlap.Transilivity analysis, Ibr example, facililales comparisonon a generally shared level of meaning.
But there is alsoa great deal of difference bchveen Chinese and English,parlicularly noliceable with respect Io exchange orMood-residue slruchu'e.
McDonald (1992), in his oullineof a FG for Chinese, does not recognise a separateMood-P, esiduc slmclure for Chinese.The FunclionaI-Selnantic Processor (FSP) has beendeveloped ill .lhe MS Windows 3.11 environnlcnl.Chinese is handled ill tile, Windows environment usingPC Express TwinBridge v.3.2.
The FSP includes threelinked components: (i) MS Word lor Windows v.6.0(WinWord) as texl-edilor; (it) the Analysl's lnlerlhcE(AI); and (iii) a database facility.
From WinWord, theanalyst can vicw the lexl, and select clauses for analysis.The AI, a Visual Basic application, is linked by meansofOl,E automalion wilh WinWord.
Working within theAll thc analysl can view, edit, and save IhE contents ofl\]elds on lbrms lot each of tile different kinds ofslructural analysis.
Using VB's database capability,enlriEs are saved to a database.
The database ntriesmay be relrieved liom within the AI, or separately usingMS Access.
MS Access nlay also be used to generalcreporls including, lot Example, consistelll IXlllErns ofusage occurring ill lhe dala.4.
T I lE  ANALYST'S INTI0;RFACETile user opens a document in WinWord, highlights theclause to be analysed, presses a button in tile toolbarlabelled IFSP\].

Oncechosen, WinWord is lninmlizEd to an icon and the \[FSP\]bullOll is dEaclivated.
Ill lhis case, lhc user chooses todo transitivity analysis on tile selecled chluse.Transilivily analysis is concerned wilh the scmanlicconfiguration of process, parlicipanl, and cit'ClHl/SlallCe,i.e.
the clatlse as a means ofrcprescnling the processes ofdoing, lhinking, being, speaking, etc.The clause lo be analysed appears ill the \[Clause\]textbox.
