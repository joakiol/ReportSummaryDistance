Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora, pages 77?86,Sofia, Bulgaria, August 8, 2013. c?2013 Association for Computational LinguisticsVARTRA: A Comparable Corpus for Analysis of Translation VariationEkaterina Lapshinova-KoltunskiUniversita?t des SaarlandesA 2.2 Universita?t Campus66123 Saarbru?ckenGermanye.lapshinova@mx.uni-saarland.deAbstractThis paper presents a comparable trans-lation corpus created to investigate trans-lation variation phenomena in terms ofcontrasts between languages, text typesand translation methods (machine vs.computer-aided vs. human).
These phe-nomena are reflected in linguistic fea-tures of translated texts belonging to dif-ferent registers and produced with differ-ent translation methods.
For their analysis,we combine methods derived from trans-lation studies, language variation and ma-chine translation, concentrating especiallyon textual and lexico-grammatical varia-tion.
To our knowledge, none of the ex-isting corpora can provide comparable re-sources for a comprehensive analysis ofvariation across text types and translationmethods.
Therefore, the corpus resourcescreated, as well as our analysis results willfind application in different research areas,such as translation studies, machine trans-lation, and others.1 Introduction: Aims and MotivationComparable corpora serve as essential resourcesfor numerous studies and applications in bothlinguistics (contrastive language, text analysis),translation studies and natural language process-ing (machine translation, computational lexicog-raphy, information extraction).
Many compara-ble corpora are available and have been being cre-ated for different language pairs like (a) English,German and Italian (Baroni et al 2009); (b) En-glish, Norwegian, German and French (Johans-son, 2002); (c) written or spoken English and Ger-man (Hansen et al 2012) or (Lapshinova et al2012).However, comparable corpora may be of thesame language, as the feature of ?comparability?may relate not only to corpora of different lan-guages but also to those of the same language.The main feature that makes them comparable isthat they cover the same text type(s) in the sameproportions, cf.
for instance, (Laviosa, 1997) or(McEnery, 2003), and thus, can be used for a cer-tain comparison task.As our research goal is the analysis of trans-lation variation, we need a corpus which allowsus to compare translations, which differ in thesource/target language, the type of the text trans-lated (genre or register) and the method of trans-lation (human with/without CAT1 tools, machinetranslation).
There are a number of corpus-basedstudies dedicated to the analysis of variation phe-nomena, cf.
(Teich, 2003; Steiner, 2004; Neu-mann, 2011) among others.
However, all ofthem concentrate on the analysis of human trans-lations only, comparing translated texts with non-translated ones.
In some works on machine trans-lation, the focus does lie on comparing differ-ent translation variants (human vs. machine),e.g.
(White, 1994; Papineni et al 2002; Babychand Hartley, 2004; Popovic?, 2011).
However, theyall serve the task of automatic machine transla-tion (MT) systems evaluation and use the human-produced translations as references or training ma-terial only.
None of them provide analysis ofspecifc (linguistic) features of different text typestranslated with different translation methods.The same tendencies are observed in the cor-pus resources available, as they are mostly builtfor certain research goals.
Although there existsa number of translation corpora, none of themfits our research task: most of them include onetranslation method only: EUROPARL (Koehn,2005) and JRC-Acquis (Steinberger et al 2006)?
translations produced by humans, or DARPA-94 (White, 1994) ?
machine-translated texts only.1CAT = computer-aided translation77Moreover, they all contain one register only and,therefore, cannot be applied to a comprehensiveanalysis of variation phenomena.Therefore, we decided to compile our own com-parable corpus which contains translations fromdifferent languages, of different text types, pro-duced with different translation methods (humanvs.
machine).
Furthermore, both human and ma-chine translations contain further varieties: theyare produced by different translators (both profes-sional and student), with or without CAT tools orby different MT systems.This resource will be valuable not only for ourresearch goals, or for research purposes of furthertranslation researchers.
It can also find further ap-plications, e.g.
in machine translation or CAT tooldevelopment, as well as translation quality asses-ment.The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-lows.
Section 2 presents studies we adopt as the-oretical background for the selection of featuresand requirements for corpus resources.
In section4, we describe the compilation and design of thecomparable translation corpus at hand.
In section5, we demonstrate some examples of corpus ap-plication, and in section 6, we draw some conclu-sions and provide more ideas for corpus extensionand its further application.2 Theoretical Background and ResourceRequirementsTo design and annotate a corpus reflecting varia-tion phenomena, we need to define (linguistic) fea-tures of translations under analysis.
As sources forthese features, we use studies on translation andtranslationese, those on language variation, as wellas works on machine translation, for instance MTevaluation and MT quality assessment.2.1 Translation analysis and translationeseAs already mentioned in section 1 above, trans-lation studies either analyse differences betweenoriginal texts and translations, e.g.
(House, 1997;Matthiessen, 2001; Teich, 2003; Hansen, 2003;Steiner, 2004), or concentrate on the properties oftranslated texts only, e.g.
(Baker, 1995).
How-ever, it is important that most of them considertranslations to have their own specific propertieswhich distinguish them from the originals (both ofthe source and target language), and thus, estab-lish specific language of translations ?
the transla-tionese.Baker (1995) excludes the influence of thesource language on a translation altogether,analysing characteristic patterns of translations in-dependent of the source language.
Within thiscontext, she proposed translation universals ?
hy-potheses on the universal features of translations:explicitation (tendency to spell things out ratherthan leave them implicit), simplification (tendencyto simplify the language used in translation), nor-malisation (a tendency to exaggerate features ofthe target language and to conform to its typi-cal patterns) and levelling out (individual trans-lated texts are alike), cf.
(Baker, 1996).
Addition-ally, translations can also have features of ?shiningthrough?
defined by Teich (2003) ?
in this case weobserve some typical features of the source lan-guage in the translation.
The author analyses thisphenomena comparing different linguistic features(e.g.
passive and passive-like constructions) oforiginals and translations in English and German.In some recent applications of translationesephenomena, e.g.
those for cleaning parallel cor-pora obtained from the Web, or for the im-provement of translation and language models inMT (Baroni and Bernardini, 2005; Kurokawa etal., 2009; Koppel and Ordan, 2011; Lemberskyet al 2012), authors succeeded to automaticallyidentify these features with machine learning tech-niques.We aim at employing the knowledge (featuresdescribed) from these studies, as well as tech-niques applied to explore these features in the cor-pus.2.2 Language variationFeatures of translated texts, as well as those oftheir sources are influenced by the text types theybelong to, see (Neumann, 2011).
Therefore, wealso refer to studies on language variation whichfocus on the analysis of variation across registersand genres, e.g.
(Biber, 1995; Conrad and Biber,2001; Halliday and Hasan, 1989; Matthiessen,2006; Neumann, 2011) among others.
Registeris described as functional variation, see Quirk etal.
(1985) and Biber et al(1999).
For exam-ple, language may vary according to the activ-itiy of the involved participants, production va-rieties (written vs. spoken) of a language orthe relationship between speaker and addressee(s).These parameters correspond to the variables of78field, tenor and mode defined in the framework ofSystemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), which de-scribes language variation according to situationalcontexts, cf.
e.g.
Halliday and Hasan (1989), andHalliday (2004).In SFL, these variables are associated with thecorresponding lexico-grammatical features, e.g.field of discourse is realised in functional verbclasses (e.g., activity, communication, etc) or termpatterns, tenor is realised in modality (expressede.g.
by modal verbs) or stance expressions, modeis realised in information structure and textual co-hesion (e.g.
personal and demonstrative refer-ence).
Thus, differences between registers or texttypes can be identified through the analysis of oc-currence of lexico-grammatical features in theseregisters, see Biber?s studies on linguistic varia-tion, e.g.
(Biber, 1988; Biber, 1995) or (Biber etal., 1999).Steiner (2001) and Teich (2003) refer to regis-ters as one of the influencing sources of the prop-erties of translated text.
Thus, we attempt to studyvariation in translation variants by analysing dis-tributions of lexico-grammatical features in ourcorpus.2.3 Machine translationWe also refer to studies on machine translation inour analysis, as we believe that translation vari-ation phenomena should not be limited to thoseproduced by humans.
Although most studies com-paring human and machine translation serve thetask of automatic MT evaluation only, cf.
(White,1994; Papineni et al 2002; Babych and Hartley,2004), some of them do use linguistic features fortheir analysis.For instance, Popovic?
and Burchardt (2011)define linguistically influenced categories (inflec-tions, word order, lexical choices) to automaticallyclassify errors in the output of MT systems.
Spe-cia (2011) and Specia et al(2011) also utilise lin-guistic features as indicators for quality estima-tion in MT.
The authors emphasize that most MTstudies ignored the MT system-independent fea-tures, i.e.
those reflecting the properties of thetranslation and the original.
The authors classifythem into source complexity features (sentenceand word length, type-token-ratio, etc.
), target flu-ency features (e.g.
translation sentence length orcoherence of the target sentence) and adequacyfeatures (e.g.
absolute difference between thenumber of different phrase types in the source andtarget or difference between the depth of their syn-tactic trees, etc.
).3 MethodologyConsideration of the features described in theabove mentioned frameworks will give us newinsights on variation phenomena in translation.Thus, we collect these features and extract infor-mation on their distribution across translation vari-ants of our corpus to evaluate them later with sta-tistical methods.Some of the features described by differentframeworks overlap, e.g.
type-token-ratio (TTR)or sentence length as indicator for simplificationin translationese analysis and as a target fluencyfeature in MT quality estimation; modal meaningsand theme-rheme distribution in register analysisand SFL, or alternation of passive verb construc-tions in register analysis and translation studies.Investigating language variation in translation,we need to compare translations produced by dif-ferent systems with those produced by humans(with/without the help of CATs).
Furthermore, weneed to compare translated texts either with theiroriginals in the source or comparable originals inthe target language.
Moreover, as we know thattext type has influence on both source and targettext (Neumann, 2011), we need to compare differ-ent text registers of all translation types.This requires a certain corpus design: we needa linguistically-annotated corpus for extraction ofparticular features (e.g.
morpho-syntactic con-structions); we need to include meta-informationon (a) translation type (human vs. computer-aidedvs.
machine, both rule-based and statistical), (b)text production type (original vs. translation) and(c) text type (various registers and domains of dis-course).
This will enable the following analysisprocedures: (1) automatic extraction, (2) statisti-cal evaluation and (3) classification (clustering) oflexico-grammatical features.4 Corpus Resources4.1 Corpus data collectionDue to the lack of resources required for the anal-ysis of translation variation, we have compiled ourown translation corpus VARTRA (VARiation inTRAnslation).
In this paper, we present the firstversion of the corpus ?
VARTRA-SMALL, whichis the small and normalised version used for our79first analyses and experiments.
The compilationof the full version of VARTRA is a part of our fu-ture work, cf.
section 6.VARTRA-SMALL contains English originaltexts and variants of their translations (to eachtext) into German which were produced by: (1)human professionals (PT), (2) human studenttranslators with the help of computer-aided trans-lation tools (CAT), (3) rule-based MT systems(RBMT) and (4) statistical MT systems (SMT).The English originals (EO), as well as the trans-lations by profesionals (PT) were exported fromthe already existing corpus CroCo mentioned insection 1 above.
The CAT variant was pro-duced by student assistents who used the CATtool ACROSS in the translation process2.
Thecurrent RBMT variant was translated with SYS-TRAN (RBMT1)3, although we plan to expandit with a LINGUATEC-generated version4.
ForSMT, we have compiled two versions ?
the oneproduced with Google Translate5 (SMT1), and theother one with a Moses system (SMT2).Each translation variant is saved as a subcor-pus and covers seven registers of written language:political essays (ESSAY), fictional texts (FIC-TION), manuals (INSTR), popular-scientific arti-cles (POPSCI), letters of share-holders (SHARE),prepared political speeches (SPEECH), and touris-tic leaflets (TOU), presented in Table 1.
The totalnumber of tokens in VARTRA-SMALL comprises795,460 tokens (the full version of VARTRA willcomprise at least ca.
1,7 Mio words).4.2 Corpus annotationFor the extraction of certain feature types, e.g.modal verbs, passive and active verb construc-tions, Theme types, textual cohesion, etc.
our cor-pus should be linguistically annotated.
All sub-corpora of VARTRA-SMALL are tokenised, lem-matised, tagged with part-of-speech information,segmented into syntactic chunks and sentences.The annotations were obtained with Tree Tagger(Schmid, 1994).In Table 2, we outline the absolute numbers fordifferent annotation levels per subcorpus (transla-tion variant) in VARTRA-SMALL.VARTRA-SMALL is encoded in CWB and canbe queried with the help of Corpus Query Proces-2www.my-across.net3SYSTRAN 64www.linguatec.net5http://translate.google.com/subc token lemma chunk sentPT 132609 9137 55319 6525CAT 139825 10448 58669 6852RBMT 131330 8376 55714 6195SMT1 130568 9771 53935 6198SMT2 127892 7943 51599 6131Table 2: Annotations in VARTRA-SMALLsor (CQP) (Evert, 2005).
We also encode a partof the meta-data, such as information on regis-ter, as well as translation method, tools used andthe source language.
A sample output encoded inCQP format that is subsequently used for corpusquery is shown in Figure 1.In this way, we have compiled a corpus of dif-ferent translation variants, which are comparable,as they contain translations of the same texts pro-duced with different methods and tools.
Thus,this comparable corpus allows for analysis of con-trasts in terms of (a) text typology (e.g.
fictionvs.
popular-scientific articles); (b) text produc-tion types (originals vs. translations) and (c) trans-lation types (human vs. machine and their sub-types).Furthermore, examination of some translationphenomena requires parallel components ?
align-ment between originals and translations.
At themoment, alignment on the sentence level (ex-ported from CroCo) is available for the EO andPT subcorpora.
We do not provide any alignmentfor further translation variants at the moment, al-though we plan to align all of them with the origi-nals on word and sentence level.4.3 Corpus queryingAs already mentioned in 4.2, VARTRA-SMALLcan be queried with CQP, which allows definitionof language patterns in form of regular expressionsbased on string, part-of-speech and chunk tags, aswell as further constraints.
In Table 3, we illus-trate an example of a query which is built to ex-tract cases of processual finite passive verb con-structions in German: lines 1 - 5 are used for pas-sive from a Verbzweit sentence (construction inGerman where the finite verb occupies the posi-tion after the subject), and lines 6 - 10 are usedfor Verbletzt constructions (where the finite verboccupies the final position in the sentence).
Inthis example, we make use of part-of-speech (lines3a, 5, 8 and 9a), lemma (lines 3b and 9b) and80EO PT CAT RBMT SMT1 SMT2ESSAY 15537 15574 15795 15032 15120 14746FICTION 11249 11257 12566 11048 11028 10528INSTR 20739 21009 19903 20793 20630 20304POPSCI 19745 19799 22755 20894 20353 19890SHARE 24467 24613 24764 22768 22792 22392SPEECH 23308 23346 24321 23034 22877 22361TOU 17564 17638 19721 17761 17768 17671TOTAL 132609 133236 139825 131330 130568 127892Table 1: Tokens per register in VARTRA-SMALLchunk type (lines 2b and 6b) information, as wellas chunk (lines 2a, 2c, 6a and 6c) and sentence(lines 1 and 10) borders.query block example1.

</s>Table 3: Example queries to extract processual fi-nite passive constructionsCQP also allows us to sort the extracted infor-mation according to the metadata: text registersand IDs or translation methods and tools.
Table4 shows an example of frequency distribution ac-cording to the metadata information.
In this way,we can obtain data for our analyses of translationvariation.5 Preliminary Analyses5.1 Profile of VARTRA-SMALL in terms ofshallow featuresWe start our analyses with the comparison oftranslation variants only saved in our subcorpora:PT, CAT, RBMT, SMT1 and SMT2.

These fea-tures are among the most frequently used variableswhich characterise linguistic variation in corpora,cf.
(Biber et al 1999) among others.
They alsodeliver the best scores in the identification of trans-lationese features.
We calculate TTR as the per-centage of different lexical word forms (types)per subcorpus.
LD is calculated as percentage ofcontent words and the percentages given in thePOS distribution are the percentages of given wordclasses per subcorpus, all normalised per cent.

In terms of translationese (seesection 2.1), TTR reveals simplification featuresof translations.
Translations always reveal lowerTTR and LD than their originals, cf.
(Hansen,2003).The highest TTR, thus, the most lexically richtranslation variant in VARTRA is the one pro-duced by human translators: PT > RBMT >SMT2 > SMT1 > CAT.
It is interesting that theother human-produced variant demonstrates thelowest lexical richness which might be explainedby the level of experience of translators (student82translators).
Another reason could be the strengthof pronominal cohesion and less explicit specifica-tion of domains.
However, the comparison of thedistribution of pronouns (devices for pronominalcohesion) does not reveal big differences betweenPT and CAT, cf.
Table 6.Another simplification feature is LD, whichis also the lowest in CAT-subcorpus of VAR-TRA: PT > SMT2 > SMT1 > RBMT > CAT.Steiner (2012) claims that lower lexical densitycan indicate increased logical explicitness (in-creased use of conjunctions and adpositions) intranslations.
CAT does demonstrate the highestnumber of adpositions in the corpus, although thedifference across subcorpora is not high, see Ta-ble 6.The overall variation between the subcorpora interms of TTR and LD is not high, which can be in-terpreted as indicator of levelling out (see section2.1 above): translations are often more alike interms of these features than the individual texts ina comparable corpus of source or target language.In terms of nominal vs. verbal word classes,there seems to be a degree of dominance of nom-inal classes (56.11% vs. 17.67%) in SMT2 result-ing in a ratio of 3.18 compared to other subcor-pora, cf.
Table 8.subc nominal vs. verbal ratioPT 53.10 : 21.06 2.52CAT 50.93 : 23.10 2.20RBMT 51.32 : 21.99 2.33SMT1 52.89 : 21.02 2.52SMT2 56.11 : 17.67 3.18Table 8: Proportionality of nominal vs. verbal op-position in VARTRA-SMALLThe greatest contributors to this dominance arenouns and adjectives (Table 6 above).
For CAT, weagain observe the lowest numbers (the lowest nounvs.
verb ratio) which means that this translationvariant seems to be the most ?verbal?
one.
Ac-cording to Steiner (2012), German translations areusually more verbal than German originals.
Com-paring German and English in general, the authorclaims that German is less ?verbal?
than English.Thus, a higher ?verbality?
serves as an indicatorof ?shining though?
(see 2.1 above), which we ob-serve in case of CAT.
However, to find this out, wewould need to compare our subcorpora with theiroriginals, as well as the comparable German orig-inals.5.3 First statistical experimentsWe use the extracted shallow features for the firststeps in feature evaluation.
As our aim is to inves-tigate the relations between the observed featurefrequencies and the respective translation variants,we decide for correspondence analysis, a multi-variate technique, which works on observed fre-quencies and provides a map of the data usuallyplotted in a two dimensional graph, cf.
(Baayen,2008).As input we use the features described in 5.1above: TTR, LD, nouns, adjectives (adj), ad-positions (adp), verbs, adverbs (adv), conjunc-tions (conj).
Additionally, we divide the classof pronouns into two groups: personal (pers.P)and demonstrative (dem.P) ?
devices to expresspronominal cohesion.
We also extract frequencyinformation on modal verbs which express modal-ity.The output of the correspondence analysis isplotted into a two dimensional graph with arrowsrepresenting the observed feature frequencies andpoints representing the translation variants.
Thelength of the arrows indicates how pronounced aparticular feature is.
The position of the points inrelation to the arrows indicates the relative impor-tance of a feature for a translation variant.
The ar-rows pointing in the direction of an axis indicate ahigh contribution to the respective dimension.
Fig-ure 2 shows the graph for our data.In Table 9, we present the Eigenvalues calcu-lated for each dimension to assess how well ourdata is represented in the graph6.
We are able toobtain a relatively high cumulative value by thefirst two dimensions (representing x and y-axis inFigure 2), as they are the ones used to plot the two-dimensional graph.
The cumulative value for thefirst two dimensions is 94,3%, which indicates thatour data is well represented in the graph.If we consider the y-axis in Figure 2, we seethat there is a separation between human and ma-chine translation, although SMT2 is on the bor-derline.
CAT is also closer to MT, as it is plottedmuch closer to 0 than PT.
Conjunctions, personalpronouns and adverbs seem to be most prominentcontributors to this separation, as their arrows are6?dim?

This corpus is an important resourcefor the investigation of variation phenomena re-flected in linguistic features of translations.
Thecorpus architecture allows us to extract these fea-tures automatically.
Our preliminary results showthat there are both similarities and differences be-tween translation variants produced by humansand machine systems.
We expect even more vari-ation, if we compare the distribution of these fea-tures across text registers available in all subcor-pora.However, there is a need to inspect the reasonsfor this variation, as they can be effected by trans-lator experience, restrictions of the CAT systemapplied or the training material used in MT.We believe that our resources, as well as our re-search results will find application not only in con-trastive linguistics or translation studies.
On theone hand, our corpus provides a useful dataset toinvestigate translation phenomena and processes,84but on the other, it can be used for the develop-ment, optimisation and evaluation of MT systems,as well as CAT tools (e.g.
translation memories).In the future, we aim at expanding it with moredata: (1) more texts for the existing registers (eachregister should contain around 30,000 words), (2)further text registers (e.g.
academic, web and newstexts).
We also plan to produce further humanand machine-generated translations, i.e.
(3) ma-chine translations post-edited by humans, as wellas translation outputs of (4) further MT systems.Moreover, we aim at adding translations from Ger-man into English to trace variation influenced bylanguage typology.As the automatic tagging of part-of-speech andchunk information might be erroneous, we plan toevaluate the output of the TreeTagger and com-pare it with the output of further tools available,e.g.
MATE dependency parser, cf.
(Bohnet,2010).
Furthermore, the originals will be alignedwith their translations on word and sentence level.This annotation type is particularly important forthe analysis of variation in translation of certainlexico-grammatical structures.A part of the corpus (CAT, RBMT and SMTsubcorpora) will be available to a wider academicpublic, e.g.
via the CLARIN-D repository.AcknowledgmentsThe project ?VARTRA: Translation Variation?was supported by a grant from Forschungsauss-chu?
