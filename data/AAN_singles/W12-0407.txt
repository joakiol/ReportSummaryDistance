Proceedings of the EACL 2012 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Deception Detection, page 48,Avignon, France, April 23 - 27 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsCurrent and Future Needs for Deception Detection  in Government Screening Environments  Daniel Baxter U.S. Department of Defense     Abstract The focus of this talk is on the applications and techniques currently used in government screening venues and on anticipated future applications.
I will begin with a discussion of how and why the polygraph is used in a screening interview and touch on some of the newer techniques in deception detection using body movements, vocal and verbal behavior that are now being tested.
We'll then look at some of the needs for deception detection and applications on our wish list.
The talk will include cases where the current technology has been good and where it has not.48
