Themost des i rab le  way to extend data  base access  capab i l i t i es  tona ive  user  popu la t ions  i s  by means of  a natura l  language in ter -face  or "front-end" system that can process requests stated inthe user's natural language.
PEARL is a domaln-lndependentsystem for  natura l  language ana lYs is  that  can be customizedto handle domain -spec i f i c  quer ies  to ex i s t ing  data  bases .PEARL ana lyzes  Eng l i sh  input  w i th  expectat ion -dr iven  p~rs ingtechn iques  end quest ion  answer ing s t ra te@les  developed byAr t i f i c ia l  In te l l igence  researchers  (Lehner t ,  /1978/ ,  Sohankand Riesbeck /1976/ ,  Riesbeok /1975/ ,  Gershmsn /1979/ ,  B i rn -baum and Se l f r idge  /1979/ ,  and produces code in  whatever  querylanguage i s  cur rent ly  be ing used to access  a spec i f i c  database.
PEARL can there fore  be adapted to any data  base thathas a query language access  module.In  any rea l i s t i c  app l i ca t ion  o f  natura l  language ana l -ys i s ,  we can expect  users  to  make mis takes ,  fo rget  to  spec i fynecessary  parameters ,  and use words that  are  not  in  thesys tem's  vocabu lary .
