!Phis article proposes a t en ta t ive  answer to a questionposed by Apostel (1971: 22) : ''what type of automata would pro-duce and use structures such as natural languages [possessll?
IChomsky has pointed out that natural  languages show commonstructural characteristiss: each natural language is derivedtransformationally from a context-free phz?ase-structure langu-age.
* Chomsky (e.g.
1968, and cf.
Lenneberg 1967) argues tha tthis shows that we have innate psychological machinery for pro-cessing language.
I have suggested  ampso son 1972a, 1975a:--ch, 8) that an rruitfux way to construct a theory of such psych-ological machinery will be to view the relation between sent-ence and hearer as analogous to tha t  between computer programand computer.
Here I wish to o f f e r  some concrete proposalsabout the ~sychological machinery involved in the comprehensionof natnrgl language, based on comparihg the structure of nat-ural language with that of actual computer programming langu-3 ages in practical use.
'1 I insert qpossess ' ,  s i d e  I prefer to speak of languasesstructures rather than being structures.
I discussown comments on this question elsewhere (Sampson2 I show elsewhere  ampso son 1973b) that this i s  an empir-i ca l  hypothesis, despite the findings of Peters & Bitchie andothers that ang recursively enumerable language can be generAated by some transformational grammar.3~hhe theory to be presented here is somewhat comparablewith that of Winograd (1972), although constructed independ-ently.
By comparison with Winograd I am less interested in thepractical problems of cormaunicating with an automaton in idiom-a t i o ,  'surface-structurea English, and mare interested in whatchqacteristiccs o f  the huinm language-processing automatondaresuggested by those features of English which appear to beuniversal,2.
It is usual to distinguish the terms automaton and - com-puter: an automaton is a mathematical abstraction of a certainkind, while a computer i s  a phys ica l  object designed t o  embodythe properties of a particular automaton (cf.
Putnam tl96031961: 147), as an ink line on a sheet of graph paper is des-igned t o  embody the properties $of a continuous function; thuse.g.
a computer 3u t  not an automaton, may break down, as agraph, but not a function, may be smudged.
Naturally, though,the only automata Tor which there exist corresponding colpputersare automata .which it is both posaible  ana u s e f u l  to realizephysically; so the  class of computers represents a rathernarrow subset of the  class of automata as defined below.
Weshall sometimes speak of 'computersv meaning 'automata of theclass to which actual computers correspond1; category mistakesneed not bother us if we are a l e r t  to t h e i r  dangers.We may define an automaton as a quadruple( f, 9, 9 -  Int, - Suc), in which 9 is a ( f i n i t e  or infinite) s e tof s t a t e s ,  & is a (finite or infinite) language (i.e.
set qfstrings of symbols), - I n t  is a partial function from 9 X 2(the Cartesian product of 9 with $) into f (the input funct-ion), apd Suc is a relation on- - f P,-e. asubse t  of Y X( the  successor.-pltate relattion).
8 is called t h e  machine langu-age of 4; a aember of & i a  a proecram.We t r e a t  the flow of time as a -succession of disczleteinstants (corresponding to cycles of a c t u a l  computers).Between any adjacent pair of instants, the automaton is i n  somes t a t e  - S 8 9, At any given instant, a program may be input.If the automaton is in -... S and P L & &, is input ,  the automatonmoves to the s t a t e  - I  Int(S, - XI); if (g, It) # dom(Int), wa saythat - L is undefined f o r  - 6 (and no change of state occurs),If no program is input, the automaton moves t o  some state - 8'such that --- S Suc St, provided there  is such a s t a t e  - S t .
(Other-wise, no change of state occurs, and - S is called a stoppings t a t e . )
If - Suo is a (partial) - function (i.e.
if f o r  each - Sthere is at most one s t a t e  - S t  such tha t  - -  S Suc S ) , the auto-maton is deterministic .Bn ordinary d i g i t a l  computer is a deterministic automatonwh~se states  are realized as different distributions oq elect-~ i c a l  charge (representing the d i g i t s  0 an& I) over t he  ' f ep r i t ecores in a s t o r e  together w i t h  a s e t  of working r e g i s t e r s  andan add.ress counter.
The number of s t a t e s  of such an automaton1s finite but very large: a simple computer with a s t o r bcontaining 4096 words of 16 b i t s  together with a single workingregister would have on the order of 5 x 10 79736 states.
heprograms of the machine language of.
such an automaton w i l leonsist of sequences of machine words not exceeding the sizeoi the store, and thus the machine language w i l l  again befinite.
The input of such a program containing, say, - n wordsw & l l  cause the automaton to load these words 'in-t;o the firsta places in it s tore ,  replacing the current contents, and to-set the  address counter to 7 .
'Phe successor-state functionis determined by the number in the addzess-counter togetherwith the code translating machine words into in$.%mct2ons;whenever the counzer contain8 the number - i the au-t;omatonch-es i ts  s t a t e  by executing the instruction in the  I - ith placein seore and incrementing the  :ounter by one, A proper subsetof the automaton's states a r e  stopping states: whenever thestorage word indicated by the address counter is not the codeof any instruction, the  machine stops.For any s t a t e  - S of a deterministic automaton, we may usethe term succession of S for the seauence of sta tes  the auto-- -maton w i l l  pass through under t h ~  control .of its successor-state function, beginning with - S and ending) (if the successioni s  f i n i t e )  at a stopping-state.
A computer is arranged so t h a t ,on entering certain states, it performs certain output actions(e .g .
it prints a symbolic representation of p a r t  of its inter-nal state onto paper).
The art of programming such a computerconsists of finding an input program which moves the  computerinto a state, the succession of which causes the computer toperform ~ c t i o n s  constituting a solution to t h e  programmer'sproblem, while being f i n i t e  and as short as possible.3 A natural language, such as English, is s p s c i f i e diiyntacfically and semantically by defining a s e t  $ constitut-ing the sentences of the laaguage together with a subset k o f,$* x % ((where ' X * '  denotes the power set of ) ,  such that, , , .

The rules of iaference for natural langu-ages w i l l  no doubt exhibit the 'structure-dependence' charact-er'iatic of syntactic transformations, as do the rules ofinZerence of formal logics, cf.
Sampson (1975a: 163-7, for th-coming) (thus, the term ' X s Y '  - in the standard rule of modusponens, i.e.

It is tempting to view the mind of a speakel' of e.g.English as an automaton in tihe defined sense, with the sent-ences of English as the programs of its machine language, andthe rules of inference of English determining the successor-s t a t e  relatioa.
In other words, some component of the  mindof an English-speaker would be a d~vice capable of entering anythe relation between sentences and semantic representations isa function.
In practice it w i l l  not  be (ambiguous sentences@ll have mope than one semantic representation), so 'the'should read 'one of the ... (respectively)'.one of a (perhaps infinitely) large nuhlber of discrete s ta tes ;hearing (or reading) a sentence w o u l d  move this device from ones ta te  t o  another in accordance with de f in i t e  rules; and otherwler;!
related to the rules of inference of English would govern'how it passes through different states when not immediatelyreacting to speech (i. ,e. when the owner of the mind is think-ing).Although the analogy is tempting, extant computers andtheir machine languages are no t  promising as sources for at h e o r y  of the relation.
between human minds and natura l  langu-ages.
The machine language sketched above is not at allreminiscent of natural  languages.
The la t ter  typically con-tain infinitely many sentences, only the simplest of which areused in practice; the machine language of 52 contains an enorm-ous but finite number of programs, and the programs which areuseful in practice (those which compute important functions)a r e  not typidally 'simple' in any obvious sense.Portunately, the machine languages of .thg various extantcomputers are not the only artificial programming languages inuse.
Partly f o r  the very reason that machine languages are sodifferent from natural languages, most programs are writtenPnot in machine languages but  in so-called 'high-levtl' .pro-gramming languages, sudh as FORTRAN, SNOBOL, APL, PL/?
(to namea few among many).
We may think of a computer AM suppl jedwith a compiler program f o r  some high-level langu'fige dH asA simulating the workings o f  a very  different,computer, sgy E.actually exists: high-level languagzs No such computer as8 r e  not  typ ica l ly  me Zachi~le languages of any physical com-puters, and there are Undoubtedly s'oupd engineering reasonsfor this.
But the abstract automaton 4 may be de~cribedj u s t  as precisely as the automaton4 whia underlies the  r e a l0computer.
One who programs an $ Isgstemr (i.e.
conjunctionof computer with deg-compiler) cok-onl~ thinks of the machinehe is dealing w i t h  z s  having t h e  eroperties of , and maybe quite unaware of the properties .of the machine-AM w i t h-.which he is in fact interacting.High-level lapguages, aad the  abstract automata whose'machine languagest they are, differ from one another in morein-teresting ways than do real computers and their machinelanguages; and furthermore (not surprisingly, since high-levellanguages are  designed to be easily usable by human programm-ers) they are much more comparable with human languages thanare r e a l  machine languages.
(Typically, a high-level pro-gramming language is a context-free phrase-structure language,f o r  instance.)
I shall suggest tha t  the relationship betweerhigh-level languages ahd their corresponding automata givesus much bet ter  clues about human mental machinery than doesthat between real computers and machine languages.50 Let me fiitst give an example of a high-level language:I shall choose the  language APL (see e.g.
Iverson 1962,Pakin 1968).
AP$ is interestbing For our purposes because itis particularly high-level: 5.e.
it is related more distantlyto machine languages of real computers, and more c l o l e l y  tohuman langudges, than many other high-level languages.
It isa real-time rather thm batch-processing language, which meansthat it is designed to be used in such a way that  the r e s u l tof inputting a program will normally be crucially dependenton the prior @-bate of the system (in a batch-processing langu-age, programs a r e  designed to be unaffected by those remainsof the p r i o r  state which survive their input): this isappropriate f o r  an analogy with human language, singe presum-ably the e f f ec t  on a person of hearing a sentence deperids in,--general on his p r i o r  system of knowledge and belief  .
'!Be  complete language APL includes many features whichare i r r e l evan t  t o  our analogy.
For  instance, there is a largeamount of apparatus f o r  making and breaking contact with thesystem, and the like; we shall ignore this, ~ u s t  as we shallignore the fact that  in human speech the effect of an utter-ance on a person depends among other things on whether the6 person is awake.
Also, APL provides what amounts to a methoduf using the language t o  alter itself by adding new vocabulary;to discuss this would again complicate the  issues we are in te r -ested inm7 We shall assume that  programmer and system arepermanently contact one another, and shall restrictour attention to a subset of APL to be defined below: raeherthan resorting to a subscript to distinguish the restrictedlanguage from APL in i t s  f u l l  complexity, we shall understand'gPLr to mean the subset of APL under consideration.
'The practicing computer user may find my definitionthe real-time/batch-processing distinction idiosyncratic;difference I describe is the only one relevant f o r  our p roftheesentpurposes, but it is far rrom the most salient difference inpractice.6 In AP'L terms, we ignore a l l  system ins~ructions, i.e.words beginning with A, Note that we use w m  underlinin(corresponding to bold type i n  p r i n t )  t o  quote b s s e q u -encee of symbols from an object-language, whether this is anartificial language such as ATL or a natural language such asEnglish.
'hn BPL terms, we ignore  the dqyinition I - mode and the useof characters V A : + .6.
We begin by defining t h e  s e t  9 APL of states of &APL.F i r s t ,  we recursively define a set of APL-prop&ties:any posi t ive  or negative r e a l  number is a numeric - APL-property of dimension #;any character on the APL keyboard (i.e.
any of a-f ipi tes e t  of characters whose iden t i ty  does not concern us)is a literal &property of dimension @;f o r  any integer I n and integer-string - D, any - n-length stringover the s e t  of numerio (literal) APL-properties ofdimedion - D is A a numeric ( l i t e r a l )  APL-property ofdimension - -  D%.
'P o r  any finitg string .I D over the integers, any numeric or lit-eral APL-property of dimension - D is an APL-property, andnothing e lse  is guch.
Clearly, there are infinitely many APL-properties..
The length of the dimension of an APL-propertyis the - rank of that APL-property.
!Phus, a number is a rank4numeric APL-property; a four-letter word, e.g.
LOVE, is a rank--1 literal -property; a 2 by 3 matrlx of numbers,emgo 3.9 2 l2 is a rank-!?

(We may thus thinkof an kPEstPt 'e as a function from a finite subset o f  Identi n t o  the set  of APEpropert ies .  )

~ r  denotes the  function taking any programmingact in to  a etring of integers representing the time of day atwhich it occurs.14 There are a number of syntactic complications, akin toeyntactic transformations in natural languages, concerning aGadic functf on called index, which is denoted - by square brack-ets;  we ignore these c o a a t i o n s ,  and shall not consider'index' apart from the other dyadic function$.current s ta te  on input of an arbitrary program, we considerthe phrase-marker of which that program is the terminal string.Beginning at the leaves and working towards the r o o t ,  and eval-uatinq the rightmoat node whenever there is a choice, we assoc-iate each - dacr node with an APL-property as i t s  denotation andeach - aest node with a change to be made to the current APE-state:  the new APL-state is the one that results from the olds ta te  by making a l l  the changes associated with the variousasst nodes in the order mentioned, terminating with the change-associated with the roo t  - asst node (which may of course be theonly one).
If at any point a - dacr node c a ~ o t  be assigned adenotation (e.g.
because it is realized as an APEidentifierwhich is not the identifier of any ob$ect in the current state),the etate-changes already made (if any) are the to ta l  changesachieved by that program.The rules for evaluating nodes a r e  as follows:A - dscr node realized as an identifier denotes the A P Lproperty, if any, paired with thaa identsfkr in the currentstate;a - dser node rewritten as numname or litname denotes theAPGproperty denoted by its 'expopent' (i.e.
the terminal mat-erial it dominates);a - dear node rewritten as - deic denotes the APL-propertygiven by applying the function denoted.
by its exponent to thecurrent programminpc-aot;when a - dscr node d+ dominates an mf node d followed by- na - decr node d+, if d denotes some monadic function f and d2-1 - -denotes an UEproperty 2 then % denotes the APL-propertyf(~), provided g e dom(f); the extension to dscr nodes rewrit-- - -ten --- dscr df dscr and dscr tf dscr dscr is obvious.-An - aset node dominating a member - i of Ident, followedby 6, followed by a dscr node denoting an APL-property E, adds* -a new &PLobject (i, - E) to the current state, destroying anyobject with the identifjer - i which may already exist in the  curr-ent stat&-; if I i is - a, a representation of 2 i s  printed out; 15a - dscr uode imediately,dominating an - aest node which hascreated an BPEobjeot  with the property E denotes 2.As a ( tr iv ia l )  example of the operation o f  these rules,consider the programinput t o  d f L  i n  s t a t e  {(A, (k 1 1 I ) ,  (B, k.r 10)).

It may seem.contradictory to say that a real d i g i t a lcomputer, which will have only f i n i t e l y  many s ta tes  and poss-i b l e  programs, can be made t o  simulate an automaton such aswhich has i n f i n i t e l y  m a n y  s t a t e s  and programs.
And, ofoouree, in practice the simulation ie,not perfect.
Althoughan -state may contain any number of objects ,  for.
any APLcomputer/compiler system there  w i l l  be a f i n i t e  l i m i t  on thenumber of objects in a s t a t e ;  although any real number m a y  bean BPL-property, in a practical APL system real numbers areapproximated t o  a fini-te tolerance.
The m a t i o n  is qui te  ana-logous to the case of natural language, where the individual'stperfomance ' ie an imperfect real izat ion of an ideal* tcompet-ence', in one sense of that  distinction; j u s t  as in linguist-i c s ,  so in the case of high-level programming languages it i snormal to give a description of the ideal system separatelyfrom a statement of the limitations on the  realizat5,on of tha tsystem in practice, which w i l l  d i f f e r  f rom one person to anotherin the natural language case, from one computer/compiler pairto another in the programming language case.Other high-level programming languages d i f f e r  from APL notonly in terms of their sentences but in terms of the nature ofthe states on which t h e i ~  sentences act.
Thus in s t a t e s  of e.g.SNOBOL, all objects a r e  character strings; in PL/1, objectsinclude not only arrays of the APL kind but a l s o  trees, treesof arrays, arrays of trees, etc.
Ijpace doea not  permit asurvey of the differences between high4Level languages w i t hrespect t o  the nature of the i r  states.8.
A t  this point we are ready to begin to answer Apostel'squestion, about what sort of automata natural languages a reappropriate programming languages for .
Any answer,to such anovel question must' obviously be very speculative; but theideas that fo l low seam plausible enough to be worth consider-ation.
We do not know with any certainty evbn what the sem-antic representations or syntactic deep structures of our sent-ences are; but we have seen t ha t  there is good reason to thinkthe two may hs similar, and we can make more or lesa detai ledconjectures about t h e i r  form.
In my exgosition I shall makevarious assumptions about aemantic representations, some ofwhiah have already been made f o r  independent reasons by otherscholars.
Insofar as my theory depends on these assumptions,a refutation of the l a t t e r  refutes the theory -- this is oneof the respects in which my theory is falsifiable, i .
e .
scient-i f i c ,I shall present my theory in a *relajxLvely informal, intuit-ive Way t o  begin with, and formalize it more carefully later.9 What we are looking f o r  is a specifica-tAon of a set  Erin -of states ,  which we can interpret as sta tes  of some subpartof the mind of an English-speaker, such that semantic repre-sent\ations of English seqtences are rather  natural devicesfor moving this part of the mind!.
from one of its s ta tes  toanother.
It will be convenient t o  have some name f o r  that partof a human's t o t a l  psychological make-up which is described byspeoifging , In earlier, unpublished work I have calledt h i a  the topicon (coined on the analogy of 'lexicong), sinceI envisage it as coneaining a se t  o f  entities correspondingto the objects o f  which ita owner is aware, and to which ha cantherefore take a definite description to refer.
Ln, then,is to be a set  of possible  topicon-staeea.
me set8  of topicon-s ta tes  available to speakers of natural languagee other thanEnglish w i l l  differ from ( f  17 below), but not inrespect of the properties on chich thia paper will concentrate.Note that a topicon-state is cer ta inly  not t o  be equatedwith a % t a t e  of mind' or tpsychological stateq: a topicon isclaimed to be only one small part of a human's mental machinery,and there w i l l  be many way8 in which the la t ter  can vary --e.g.
the human may be happy or sad, asleep or awake -- withoutimplying any difference in topicon-state.Just as an APEstate contains a s e t  of APLobjects withproperties drawn from a fixed clase, so a topicon-state willcontain a set of o b ~ e c t s  I shall ca l l  referents.
'6 supposesome person - P knows of the existence of a red car - C; then P 1 s  111)topicon will include a referent - c corresponding to - C. Thqreferent a c will be - P 1 s  'Idea1 of - C, in Gehchts terms (1957).The possible properties f o r  referents will be determined by t hevocabulary of - P 1 s  language, in this case English: each lexicalitem of English will correspond to a referent-property.

But, at any given time, - P 1 s  topicon will contain onlya f iniee number of referents.

On the  other  hand,when he, hears (2b) the NP *he red car will pick out  the refer----ent which a red car has already created (in order to act on it---in ways which will be discussed later).
In other  words, thedistinction between the ,Arvrr.MccH- red car and a red car is quite parallelN--to the distinction between - dscr and - asst consti tuents,  reapect-ively , the  se lects  from the currents ta te ,  the latter adds an object to the current s ta te .
Let uscal l  natural-language expressions which act i n  the former way'identifying expressionst (IEs), and expressions which ac t  i nthe latter way aestabliahing expressionsa (323s).
Clearly theIE/EE distinction is related t o  the traditional dis t inc t ionbetween :definiteq and 'indefinitea W e .
However, I do notclaim that-/all  def inite  and indefinite MP8 count as IEs o r  EXsrespectively.
Consider, for instance, the -- de dicto  / -- de re(or opaque referents / transparent reference) ambiguity exhib-i t e d  by 9 s  in 'intensional contextst (see s.g. Quine 1960: $30;I am 1- for an (3)  4, --In the -- de dicto sense of - ah -, (3)  does not imply thatthere are any elephante, although in the -- de re sense it impliesthat there ia at least  one.
Only in the -- de re sense is an ele-w -hant in (3)  an EE in my t a m s ,  though p t a c t i c a l l y  an eL -ant is clearly an 'indefinite NPt in both cases.
On the otherw---hand, in sentences containing quantifiers, definise lBPB may notalways be IEs: thus, in (4) the definite NP the -does not denote a particular object (and therefore, perhaps,does not pick out a particular one of the hearer's referents).j u s t  as the indefinite NP cH.

Later I shal l  considersome of *he aspects of EnglLah which my theory does not handlesuccessfully as it stands.men in the subset of Englisli considered here, no t  alldefinite NPa w i l l  in fact refer to referents already in thehearer's topicon.
For instance, a chi= may come home fromschool at- the  beginning of a new term and say t o  h i s  mother:(5) I saw the new teacher r r - E A M .
- -It may be that  the mother does not  know that  there is a newteacher, i.e, it may be that her topicon contains no referentfor which the  phrase the new teacher is appropriate; but inAMh--practice she i s  likely to work out from her child's sentencethat there is a new teacher, and to understand t h a t  the childsaw him.
other words, this phrase the-teacher a c t s  as an EE to create a new referent in the mother's7topicon.
However, it seem8 plausible to say that  this is insome sense not the central use of a phrase such as the  neww -teacher; it-would be more appropriate, if the mother does not-h o w  about the new teacher, for the child to say something l ike :(6) There is a new teacher at school and I saw him t-~ E k s .

Notice thatthe mother may react t o  (5) by sayin6 something like:(7) What new teacher?
I didn't know there was one.--- f f - v - - J I M M V ( ,which would not be a poasible reaction to a sentence using theEE a new teacher.-- -What happens when the mother successfully acquires a newreferent-in response to ( 5 ) ,  I suggest, is that she imaginessome clrcurnscance in which the new teacher would succeed inA - w v - 7picking ref eren-t; her topicon -- for instance, if therewere a new teacher at her child's school -- and, in imaginingthese circumstances, creates the *referent; after which thesentence operates on her topicon i n  the normal way.
The APLsystem d ~ e s  not work like this: if one inputs the  sentenceA + B t o  an APL-state lacking an object named B, t he  systemAhAmmrJ &prints o u t  a message pointing out one's error but does notchange sta te .
It is natural enough, though, that human lingu-is t ic  behaviour shows more initiative than the behaviour ofartificial automata.
A programmer has complete control overthe automaton he programs, and it is easier to require theprogrammer to get his programs right than t o  equip the automatonwith routines to guess what the programmer means by defectivesentences.
A human speaker, on the other ,had, has no way ofknowing exactly what s t a t e  his hearer's topicon is in, so it isall to the good if the hearer can comp6ffgate in simple casesfor  defects i n  the speaker's sentences.Gince-I shall frequently be speaking of the relationsbetween linguistic sqressions, topicon-referents, and th'e ent-ities in the outside world which the linguistic expressionsdenots, l e t  me lay down some tsrminolog&cal conventions, I shalluse denotation f o r  the relation between an'IE and  he thingwhich a hearer takes that IE to correspond to; my theory assertsthat denotation i8 a composition of two relations, a relationof reference between linguistic expressions and topicon refer-ents, and a relation of representation between topicon-refer-ents and things.
Thus, i f  the phrase your car said t o  P now-- -picks out a ref erenti =, in - P's  topicon,  and if - P owns exactlyone car - C, then your car refers - to 2, and denotes - C, and s,represents - C. We say' that =, is the referent -4 of and - C thedenotatum of, = car (on this occasion),hlCkVNotice that an IE may refer, without denoting: if - P hasC r i m e  Punishment, then h i s  w i l l  tworeferents, say 3 and q, such-that refers to E~and ~ l a n a  Ivanovna refers t o  r even though nei ther  of these-- -3)NPs denotes anything (and, correspondingly, 3 and g, will bothL...have the property S ( f  ictional) ) .
Furthermore, identhy  of thePdenotata of two IEs does not imply identity of their referents.Thus, if - P knows tha t  I have exactly one brother  and that  heis the new doc%or, then the IEs the new doc to r  and---brother will re fe r  to the same referent in P f s  topicon, and7 -henoe also denote the  same man (the details of reference bymeans of the genitive construction are discussed in 912 below);but if - P knows that I have one brother and that there is a newdoctor, but does not realize t h a t  they are the same man, thenthe two IEs w i l l  refer  to d i f f e ren t  r e fe ren t s  in - Pgs topicon,even though each of these referents will in fact represent the(10.
So far we have assumed tha t ,  when a hearer hears an IEauuh as the red car, his topicon contains only one referent---~ 5 t h  the properties $(red) - and $(car).
H Clearly this will notin general (or even usually) be so: when one hears an IE, itwill often be the case that one knows of a number of objectsI nfitting the description. '
l  One who hears the red car will take--vthe phrase to refer to one among the various red cars of whichhe is aware which is in some way closer than the others to the' 7 ~ f  Russellg s theory of descriptions  u us sell K190511949: 1051 Whitehead & Russell 1927: 30) were an accurate sem-antic desclription of English (which Russell did not ,  of course,claim- it to be -- cf.
his 119573 1969 : 335-7), then most Eng-l i sh  sentences uttered in practice would be simply false becausethey_contain IEs asserting the ungqueness of objects  fittingdescriptions which in fact  are multiply instantiated.
Philo-sophers who have discussed reference have treated it as a simplerelation between expressions and things,  rather than as thecompoaite r e l a t i on  f o r  which I argue; but they have succeededin this only by devotiag undue attention to NPs, such as Soc-rates or -which perhaps have only onep-le to be qui te  rare i n  pract-ice .focus of his attention.
This will translate iatm our theoryas the notion that the referents in a topicon a r e  arrayed insome kind of space, one point of which constitutes the focusof attention at any given time, The nature of this space, andthe factors which determine the  pos i t ion  of the referents andfocus of attention in it,, will be considered in 916 below; f o rthe moment, let us simply assume fhat the notion can be madeprecise.

However, although some logicians havedi~cussed proper names, under the label sinmlar - terms, as if181 can offer no explanation of the  syntactic distinctionbetween nouns and adjectives, which serves no obvious semanticm c t i o n ;  however, since the distinction appears to be univer-sal in natural laaguagGs, my account of English semantiq repre-sentations w i l l  incorporate it.
( W e  solution to this puzzleray have to do with the fact that Borne adjectives are 'syncat-egorematic' in a way which nouns never are:  a 'goad actor'  isnot necessarily good though he is necessarily an actor.
)tney are the equivalent of APL identifiers ( f o r  a summary ofthe alternative views, see Oheng 1968), English proper namesin fact do not behave in this way.
In APL, a s t a t e  in whichtwo  distinct objects bear the same i den t i f i e r  is simply not  awell-formed s ta te .
In English, on the other hand, locutionslike :(8) Do you mean our Charles or your Charles?- *H*J(HICICYr- - - /CCH(-The London in En- iz b a  than the London in (9) - , ---#us-occur frequently enough: although many proper nouns apply onlyto one referent in an average topicon,  many apply to more thanone.
Superficially, proper nouns seem syntactically distinctfrom common nouns in that IEs containing proper nouns lack - the:the car, but not *the London.
However, Gloat  (1969) has arguedW I I C C h S .
--convincingly that in deep syntactic s t ructure  proper nouns arepreceSded by the, and that proper and common nouns are syntact--ically quite parallel in the base.

(car) ~ m h  referent.
(me problems of how the  pairsof IEs  in (8) and ( 9 )  succeed in referring to distinct re fe r -ents will be answered in 912 and $15 respectively.)
Clearlythere is a disttnction between names and common nouns in tha tthe applicabi l i ty  of a name to an object is more 'arbitrarytthan that of a common noun.
But  this distinction is gradientrather than all-or-none; e.g.
a schoolboyts nickname, such asF m ,  will be intermediate in arbitrariness (a boy cal ledP s  will probably be fat, but not all fa t  boys w i l l  be cal led12.
A somewhat more complicated s i t u a t i o n  arises in conn-ection with IEs involving genitive constructions.

So far I have discussed only referents correspondingto ndun-phraaes in syntax, and representing individuals in theoutside world.
However, some referents will represent whatwould more normally be cal led 'facts' or 'events' than 'individ-uals'.
Ordinary predicate logic distinguishes sharply betweenindividuals on the one hand, and facts or events on the other:the former are translated i n t o  singular terms, t h e  l a t t e r  i n t o'g~inguiats do not usually include t he  first and secondperson pronouns among the ' d e i c t i c s ' ,  but logically they are o fthe same category.arrays of predicate followed by arguments, and the syntax ofthe predicate calculus does not permit one to occur in placeof the other.
However, in English, if e.g.
John -b-t -- the carhas the semantic representation ' f (a ,  - - .LI b)' (where - f is the  pred-icate b s  and - a and a b are singular  terms standing for John and$he car), then presumably the  semantic representation of:(10) It surprised Mary tha t  John the car.- u w - - -  w -will have t o  have 'f(a, 3- - b)' as one of the arguments of the pre-dicate su rise -- (10) w i l l  have to be represented as some- &thing like 'g( f(a, 3L - b), ) ,  where g is and c standsf o r  Mary (tense is discussed later in this section).
20- If''liosenbaum (1967) has shown that  in deep syntax, beforethe application of a transformation called 'Extraposition',(10) has the normal subject-verb-object s t ruc ture  with t ha t-a b -  the car - as subject.
The need to permit proposlt-ions as arguments of predicates is discussed by Leech (1969:25-6).
In the *selnan$ic representations' given here, I arrangethe predicate-symbol t o  the left of all the arguments, in orderto clarify the c~mparison with standard logical  notation.
Itis by a qui te  arbitrary choice, however, t h a t  formal log icwrites 'f(a, 2)' rather than 'a f b', and when I define &Qelow I azll adopt the orderiiig-which more c lose ly  Engreflects the surface stzmcture of English.
(Ct is a moot pointwithin linguistics whether the dee structures of English sent-ences have 'the ordering subject-ver _% -obJect or verb-subject-object.)
-facts, as well as things, may be denoted by su i t ab le  linguisticexpressions, then suppose t h a t  topicon contains refer-ents representing facts (propositional referents) as well asreferents representing things (individual referents).
We w i l lsuppose fu r the r  tha t  the referents in a topicon are linked ina graph structure in which propositional referents dominaten-tuples of (propositional or individual) referents ,  corresp--onding t o  the arguments of the  respective propositions.
Con-sider e.g.
one who knows that someone called John bought a car:his topicon will contain a structure of the  following form:In (11) nodes stand f o r  referents, which I s h a l l  c a l l  'r '-1* etc.
(N.B.
I shall always use 'rm f o r  nodes of topicon- 'g2 9 cIs t a t e s ,  as opposed to 'dl - f o r  nodes of phrase-markers of sent-ences).
The lowest-level referents are unlabelled, while thehigher-level referents are each label led  with an English word.
'Phe referents =, and g2 represent respectively John and the car,while represents the fact that John bought the car.
Thereferent r represents the  fact that the thing represented by-54 is a car, while r represents the fact that  the thing repre- -3sented by 2, is a John ('is called "Johnu1.

*--The number of referents dominated by a given referent ina topicon will corrdlate with the label of the latter referent.A n  unlabelled referent will be an individual referent and w i l ldominate nothing; a referent labelled with an - n-adic predicatew i l l  dominate an I n-tuple of referents.
5 u s  a referent labe l ledw i t h  a noun will dominate one referent; a referent labelledwith a verb taking subject, direct objec t ,  and indirect obaectwill dominate a 3-tuple of refiirents; and so on.
In naturallanguages the distinctions between the different arguments ofa verb are shown sometimes by ordering, sometimes by preposit-ions ( t o  /HS or case endings (Johami), e tc .
-I assume that some individual referents represent pointsof time, and t ha t  one of the arguments of most verbs in natura llanguages is the time at which the action in question occurred.me re  a verb in the p re t e r i t e  occurs with no phrase overt lydenoting a point of time, I take it that the nearest time ref-erent t;o the hearer's current focus of attention becomes therespective argument o f  the new propositional referent:  onewould not normally say e.g.
- John b a t  the mW.-- car unless thehearer can be expected to know what occasion one is speakingabout.

The absence of syntactic di9-tinction between phrases establishing proposit ional referentsa d  phraseril identifying them can readily be explained.
EitherJohn bought the  car a t  the time i n  question or he did not;there will never be two referents both labelled b s  and domin-ating the same 3-tuple of individual referents,  so if - P'stopicon contains (11) and he hears the phrase tha t  John-7the car then he knows tha t  t h i s  must re fe r  t o  r+ rather  thanCcrru"-cal l ing for the  creat ion of a new propositional referent.

The principle that each sentence received by a hearercreates a new referent in the hearer's topicon suggests a nat-ural way of reconstructing within the theory the notion of afocus of attention9, which varies with the topics  being dis-cussed: we may define the focus of a t ten t ion  as the most rec-ently-created referent at any given time.
The graph structureassociated with propositional referents offers a way of formal-izing the notion of distance between referents in the topicon:we may define the distance between any two referents as theminimum number of edges ( e  Unes  which link nodes) tha t  mustbe traversed t"o get from one referent  to the other.
Thus, con-sider the  sequence of sentences: (ihJ John - a car.- --(ii) m e  car hit a man.

Intuitively this prediction seems correct.The relation Suc-Eng ' which determines which possible nextstatis Jmg can move to from any given state independently ofinput, will correspond to the rules of inference in the semant-ic description of English.
Thus, suppose there is a rule' x  f i s h  & g; catch x -+ x die a in English (i. e. suppose it is-- -- - -par t  of the meMng of the words f i s h ,  die, and catch that a-- -f i s h  dies if it is caught); then the topicon of (20)  w i l l  bel i a b l e  at any time to acquire a referent labelled die and dom-/\hN.h a t i n g  r or , since each of these have the property #(fish)-3 -and occur as second argument of a referent labelled e m .Clearly, Lg will be a non-deterministic automaton: thesingle ru lerof  inference mentioned permits two alternativesuccessor states for (20).
Anydne with experience of construct-ing deductions in formal logic bows  that there are typicallya large (though finite) number of ways of continuing a givenderivation; similarly, the rules of inference for a naturallanguage will no doubt permit many.posaible successor-statesfor any given state.
If the process of moving t h r o u e  statesunder the control of the successor-stale relation is .to be thereconstruction within the topicon theory of the pretheoret icalnotion of thinkinq, this characteristic seems desirable: wedo not feel that human thought flows along deterministicchannels.

Although the effects of most changes of s t a t e  in t h ecases of t he  machine-language discussed in 82 and of APL wereconfined to the automata themselves, in both cases cer ta instate-changes were associated with act ion by the automaton onits environment.
Thus, whenever an APL-state acquired anobject named -3 a a representation of the proper ty  of t h a t  obj-ect  was, printed by the system on an output sheet of paper.
Wem a y  imagine that action is linked to thought in this way alsoin the human case.
Suppose some referent in a topiconrepresents the person who owns that topicon; then it might bethat whenever, during a sequence of state-changes controlledby the successor-state relation, the topicon acquires a refer-ent labelled assert and dominating % in subject pos i t ion  and-some proposi*ional referent E, i n  o b j e c t  pos i t i on ,  the ownerof the topicon utters a sentence which asserts the propositionrepresented by zq.
And, supposing 9 represents some person,say John, if a hit referent  is created dominating ( z2) then-2 6 ~  do not intend this paragraph to imply any positionon the determinism/fsee-will issue.
If determinism i s  correct ,then there will presumably be laws deciding which out of thevarious successor sta tes  permitted by the rules of inferenceof its language a given topicon actually moves i n t o  a t  a giventime.
Such laws l i e  outside the scope of t h i s  article.the topicon-owner hits John.
2719.
There are two obvious problems Connected with the notionthat the referents in a topicon, which are supposed to corre-spond to the  en t i t i e s  of which the topicon-owner is aware andthe propositions he believes, are created by input sentences.The first problem is that no allowance is made for the poss-ibility that speakers are not believed.
Thus, i f  the topicon-owner hears John, the denotatum of s2, say I b a t  a car yest-t d .
I U -  -erdag, then according to the rules I have laid down his top-icon acquires a ?
(oar) ~ r h k  referent representing John's new car.But in practice, obviously the topicon-owner may choose to dis-believe John; what happens to his  topicon in this case?The second problem is that it is  simply untrue that aperson acquires bel iefs  about the existence of entities and thetruth of propositions only by being told about them, I maycome to believe that there exists a red car either becauseJohn tells me that he has bought a red car and I believe h i m ,or because I see the red car; similarly, I may come to believethat John bought the red car either because he t e l l s  me so orbecause I watched the transaction take place.
The car maysubsequently be denoted by the phrase the red car, and the pro-w--position about it by the clause that  John bought the red car,h c u m - N c r k * N c - ~ -irrespective of whether the referents r e w t .
s e h t ~ ~  the car and theproposition were ere-ated in response to speech or observation,27~hesa remarks may sound as if I an!
t r ea t ing  humans asmindless robots -- 'automata1 in the pejorative, deterministicsense -- but quite the reverse: remember that the referentswhose creation correlates with the topicon-owner's actions arebrought in to  being by the process we have identified with think-ing.
There is nothing disrespectful to our species in suggest-ing that our actiens are  controlled by our thought.The answers to these problems are related.
I suggestthat the sight of John buying a car ia the kind of input  to aperson that ha8 the effect on his topicon which I have so farattributed to the hearing of the sentence John b-t a car (or- #---John b=t the c a r  if the car is one of which the topicon- --'owner is already'aware): in other words, this sight createsa referent labelled buy and dominating referents representing-John and the car.
On the other hand, hearing, say, Mary utter-ing %he words John -b m t  -- a c a r ,  or hearing John say I b-t#v-a car, has a more complex effect than I have been suggesting:c.L-it creates a node label led assert dominating the referent7representing Mary (or John) together with a new buy referent28 -as already mentioned.I diagram the two cases in (21) and ( 2 2 ) ,  on the next page.The part of the diagram in solid lines is the  same in each case,and represents part of the hearer's topicon before the changeof state.
In (21) the dotted l i nes  represent the  effect onthe t o p i c a  of aeeing John buy a car; in t h i s  case, since thetopicon owner sees the car, r e  may assume t ha t  he adds somefurther facts about it (such as that  it is red) to his topicon.In (22) the  dotted lines show the r esu l t  instead of hearingJohn say I b s t  a car.
In this case, the referent represent-- NWing the car will be dominated jus t  by the car node and the-node, since the hearer has no independent information about it.2%oss (19'70) and others have claimed that there is actu-ally syntactic evidence t h a t  J J  b m  % s r  has a deep struct-u r e  something l i k e  I sert tfi John ou ht agar.
Ross's + arguments are attacEed by raser WO b e y s o n  (1970), Bat th-ews (1972).
My theory is intended to be independent of Ross'sclaim, although the la t te r ,  if accepted, would possibly makemy theory seem more plausible,Notice that ,  if John t e l l s  you he has b ~ u g h t  a car, youmay well doubt that he has bought a car but you a r e  not freein the same way to doubt that John has asserted tha t  he hasbought a car.
You m a y ,  of course, doubt the la t te r  also --'Did he keally say the words I thought I heard him say?
', 'CanI be sure it was really John speaking?'
-- but t h i s  is to doubtthe accuracy of one's observations, as one may doubt whetherJohn bought a car after watching him buy it, rather than doubt-ing the truth of what is said to one.Clearly there are enormous problems about how observationsvia the senses of a complex and continuous environment resultin topicon changes corres@onding to the input of a discretesentence: why should my view of John handing over a chequeon the car-dealer's forecourt change my topicon in the waywhich corresponds t o  the sentence John b a t  a car, rather - --than any of the (surely) infinitely many other propositionswhich could be corroborated on the evidence of my currentvisual, auditory, etc.
inputs?
However, these problems are inno sense created by the topicon theory: these a r e  alreadyfamiliar problems in psychology and in the philosophy of science.(Cf.
e.g.
Hanson 1948, Gregory 1970.)
Some process of derivingdiscrete propositional beliefs from continuous sensory inputmust occur, if observation is to be relevant to propositionalknowledge at all.
Since this process i s  known t o  exist indep-endently of my theory, and since I can make no contribution tomaerstanding is, I shall not consider it fur ther .Once we agree to treat simple declarative sentences ascreating propositional referents labelled assert, there is no-special diMiculty in handling sentences performing other i l l o c -r l t ionary  acts; e.g.
- Shut - the door!
-will establish a commandPreferent dominating referents representing speaker, hearer, andthe proposition that  the hearer will shut the door.Rules of inference may permit referents representing factsabout the world to be created on the basis of referents repre-senting facts about assertions.
Suppose, f o r  instance, tha tthere is a rule of inference which we might s ta te  as'x - a-t ;e, -- x t r u t h f u l  -+ ;E t r u e ' ;  - then a topicon includingreferents representing the f a c t  that John i s  t r u t h f u l  and mefact that John asserted t h a t  he bought a car w i l l  be able tomove to a s t a t e  in which the representation bf the propositionasserted by John is &true) ,  - as shown:Similarly, one can imagine thaf there might be rules of infer-ence taking a topicon from the s ta te  created by the receptionof S k t  the door!
to a s t a t e  which causes the topicon-owner to---shut the door.
However, here we come close to the point atwhich my theory in its present s ta te  breaks down; I defer ais-cussing this20.
According to the theom I have sketched, English asgram@ language is not dissimilar to DL, SNOBOL, etc,resembles the l a t t e r  in that i t s  states consist of arrays~ b j e c t s  &awn from a specified class (although the precisstructure of the arrays is different as between English athe artificial programming languages, as it ie between thelatter themselves), and io.
that the structural descriptions ofI t s  sentences include a subclass of nodes which pick out  obj-ects from the current s ta te  and another rsubclass which add newobjects t o  the current state.
English differs from &PL, SNO-BO&, etc., in lacking identifiers, and in using the propertyof distance between objects in a state  in order t o  identifyobjects.My theory is certainly inadequate to account f o r  manyquite elementary facts about English and other natural langu-ages.

Before discuseing the objections to it, let me mentiona number of points to which my theory offers satisfactorysoltatioas.In the first place, the theory is attractive simply becau-se it offers an answer (emn i t t h e  answer eventually turns o u tto be wrong) t o  the question why humans should spend so muchof' their time exchanging the abstract structures called 'sent-ences': unlike cultivating the ground or building houses, theutility of this occupation is not immediately apparent to theobserver (Sampsan 1972a, 1 9 7 5 ~  133-6).
In my theory, theexchange of sentences, like direct, observation 'of the environ-ment, helps humans build up a complex but finite 'map-' Or'model' of the world, a model whtch can be described in quite*concrete terms and which controls the human's actions in myswhich, again, in prindiple should be quite expl ic i t ly  defin-able.The notion tmodel' is of course g- central one in the mostinfluential current view of what language is for -- the viewwhich explicates natural-language semantics in terms of 'modeltheory'.
B U ~  the 'possible worlds ' of model theory, unlikethe topicons o f  my theory, are infinitely complex entitieswhich can hardxy be taken to represent characteristics offinite human minds.
Burthemore, in the model-theoreticapproach to nratural language, the point about a true sentencei s  that it aenotee the Bregean truth-value True (see e.g.
wppes1973); but if we think of the act of uttering a true sentenceas the act of aenating the Tme, then it is quite unclear whypeople sBou?d utter sentences ( l e t  alone why tneg should utterone t rue sentence rather than another).
29 [~oo tno te  on p.59a]In my theory, t o  utter a par t icular  true sentence to a heareris to .make a part icular  change to his mental model of the worldwhich gives the hearer more premisses from which to predict  theconsequences of his  actions; thus, the more t rue  sentences aperson hears, the more rational his actions can be.theory has some more specific points in its favour.It explicates neatly some syntactic/semantic dist'inctions whichseem rather pervasive in natural language bdt which have res-i s t e d  other attempts at explication: the definite/indePinitedistinction in noun-phrases, the restrictive/appo&ive distinct-ion in relative cxaflses.
Also it neatly explains the genitiveoonstruction.
Acoounts of the genitive which treat it in termsof possessioh (e.g.
Suppes 1973: 382-3) a r e  simply W a i t h f u lt o  the facts; it seems that any relation between the denotatumof the head Ell?
and that of the genitive NP in a genitive phrasecan be used to upderatand such a phrase, but this makes senseonly if, for a given hearer, there are  a well-defined, limitedset of relations between denotata -- as qoy theory asserts.
Mytheory .shows how it can be that definite descriptions succeedin referring even thougb,, contrary t o  Russell's theory ofdescriptions, the properties they mention are typically notiniquely instantiated -- and, more remarkably, in the  case ofpronouns no properties of the denotatum are.
specifies at a l l .My theory ie also satisfying in i ts  treatment of presupp-oeitione.
Although the fact that sentences typically embodypreeuppoektions has by now received much discussion in linguist-i ce ,  it has not been clear how the distinction between aasert-2%or objections to model theory as a means of explicatingnatural-1-a e semantics and pragmatics, cf.
Sampson (1974,1975b), Patts f 4975), Jaraing & Jardine (1975).ions and presuppositions should be represented in terms of syn-tact ic  or semantic descriptions.
One proposal (cf.
Fillmore1969, .&&off 1969, Horn 1970) is that the semantic descriptionof a sentence should be a pa i r  of objects,  one element repre-sentingX9qe proposition asserted and the other the propositionpresupposed.
This proposal is problematical, first because itseems arbitrary - why should a sgmantic description of a sent-ence consist of a pair of propositions rather than one propo-s i t i o n  or a 5-tuple of propositions?
-- and, more seriously,because it is not clear that  there  is in general dust one oreven any fixed number of propositions presupposed by a sentence,as there i s  just one proposition asserted by a sentence.
Thus,the sentence:(24) The car which John bought i e  red.- - - r h M C C r C r - c h M .
-presupposes that  John b- a car, but also presumably tha t(ChhM & -there ie someone called John; John's car perhaps presupposes-w----- --that JohD bought a car, but perhaps alludes to the fact thatJohn was almost mm down by a car, etc.
e tc .
On my theory,failure of presupposition occurs when the input sentence isundefined for the current topicon-state.
(24) will f a i l  ifthere is no triple z,, , r-+ of referents in the current s t a t esuch that % ie ( S )  , is ?
(car), vCMk z3 is labelled s, and%3 immediately dominates ( 2).
To say that (24) presupp-oses that John b e t  a ear corresponds to the fac t  tha t  if-- ck-the latter phrase does not pick out  any current referent; by therules R 4 R I O  which define the function Xnt-Eng ' then $he sent-ence ( 2 4 ) l  F a i l  t-o create a node labelled assert --- i .
e .will fail to make an assertion.
Presupposition-failure isquite &;in to the case in APL when a - dscr node is realized asan identifier belonging to no current object, or as a functiontogether with a set of arguments falling outs'ide the domain ofthat function; in the APL case, higher - asst  nodes will f a i l  tocreate corresponding APL-objects, as the sentence (24) failst o  create either  a referent labelled red or one labelled assertnMh -in a topicon lacking zqe3.I have argued elsewhere (l972b) that  the reason why theLiar paradox does not render English inconsistent is that, asa matter of observable fact ,  a definite description in a naturallanguage ia never taken by naive native speakers to refer toa propoeition asserted by the sentence in whic*h tha t  defihitedeeoription occurs, whether or not  paradox would r e s u l t  if itwere.
'Phi@ immediately raises the question why natural  langu-agee should have such a convenient property.
My theory explainsthis simply: in natural languages, as in APL, in t e rp re t a t ionof nodee takes place not simultaneously but sequentially, fromthe boetom upwards.
A t  the time the referent of the NP what I- -am now e a  is to be locafed, the referent ta be cr-aated byw-the, eentenas cwhat I am now is false cannot yet havew w H w -  --been brought i n t o  existence, so the possibility tha t  the twoletgh'b be identiaal does not  arise.%!he theory aleo explaine the puzzling fact  that(25) Soott: is iientical to the author of 'Waverley'.-Chrc--- --~ a n  be a u~eful thing t o  say, while"(26) Saott is identical to 6 c o t t .-----can hardLy be so (Bussell 7905: 108; cf .
e.g.
Linsky 1967: 26).
(26) will pick out the same referent, say g,, twice, and createa referent label led ident ica l  and dominating (r r ) but we- -1 ' -?Imay assume that a rule of inference of English s ta tes  that any-thing is i den t i c a l  to itself, i.e.
tha t  a referent  labelledidentical may always be created dominating (r r ) f o r  any- -x' --xre fe ren t  - rx.
Therefore the input sentence acEievZs nothingthat the s~ccessor-s ta te  r e l a t i on  could not have achieved inde-pendently of any input.
In the case of ( 2 5 ) ,  however, if thehearer does not  know that S c o t t  is the  author of 'Waverleyf,then t h e  two NPs will pick out different referents r,,, 3 inhis topicon and w i l l  create an iaentical node dominating -clearly'no Ehglish rule of inference w i l l  do this.
r 1, 9 4 30The composite nature of the denotation relation incorpor-a t e d  within my theor;tr copes neat ly with the fac t  t ha t  naturallanguages use exactly the same syntactic devices f o r  discuss-ing characters in f i c t i o n ,  and the l i k e ,  as f o r  discussing realentities.
Anyone who has read C r i m e  - and Punishment will under-stand the sentences:(27) Raskolnikov killed Alena Ivanovria.----(28) ~ l k a  Ivanovna killed Raskolnikov.----and will agree that the former is t rue  and the l a t t e r  false.3 0 ~ t r i c t l y  speaking, (25).
will create an assert node ,dom-inat ing the ref @>pent representing the utterer m) and thet ical  --- node mentioned.
We may assume that  one of,a Sue,_ lays down that when two dis t inc t  nodethe rulephrasesa r e  identical) a new s t a t e  may be formed in which r and r' are.replaced by a single referent  connected with a l l  tEe r e f E e n t sto-which e i the r  - r-or - rt were linked.Y e t ,  in t he  case of formulae of the predicate calculus such asf(a, b), f(b, a), if a or b lack denotation then the formulae-3 - I L  - LI I I )as wholes seem to be ei ther  both fa lse  or both meaningless,but not interestingly dif ferent .
Reichenbach (1947: 549) hasoffered a logic  which includes representations of sentencesabout fictional entities, but in his system the symbol-arrayscorresponding to NPs having fictional referents are qu i t e  d i f f -erent in kind from those corresponding to NPs having r e a l  refer-ents.
There is no trace of such a distinction in the syntaxof natural  languages.
In my theory, the NPs Raskolnikov andRichard.
Nixon work in exactly the same way as each o the r  --w-they each pick  out one of the referents in the hearer's top icon-- so it is natural that the NPs are syntactically parallel.The fac t  that  the referent of Baskolnikov will have the proper-ty $(fictional) while that of Richard Nixon has the propertyP --?
(real) - is no mode reason to distinguish sentences (27 )  and(28) from sentences about Richard Nixon and Sp i ro  Agnew syntact-i ca l ly  than is the fact that the referent  of Raskolnikov hasthe property J(~ussian) while that of: - Nixon has the proper ty?(~merican).
-31 -3'~he topicon theory thus seams t o  make some sense of theontological views of Meinong (79l3) and the ear ly  Russell (cf.Linsky 1967: 2 ) .
Meinong was troubled by the  t r u t h  of e.g.
(i) Pegasus does not exist.----since, if Pegasus real ly does not exist, there appears to benothing which (i] can be about, and thus (i) cannot make a t ruestatement.
Meinorig therefore suggested (382-3, 491) t h a t ,although it was true of only .some definite descriptions thattheir denotata actually existed, the denotatum of any'de~initedescription had quasi-existence, and t h i s  was enough-for ane n t i t y  to serve as the sub~ec t  of a statement.
In our terms,to 'denote a quasi-existent object1 is to refer to a referent;to 'denote ,an existent~ob~ect~ is t o  refer to a referent havinga denotatum.Finally, my theory suggests why there are t h r e e  categoriesof Austinian 'speech acts'.
Austin (1962) dist'inguished (notconsistently, admittedly) between locutionary a c t s  (speaking),illooutionary acts (doing something, e.g.
giving an order, - inspeaking), and perlocutionar~ acts (achieving some effect, e.g.causing the hearer t o  perform an action, through speaking).
(A number of current commentators on Austin would not agreew i t h  presentation of his distinctions; however, believemy discussion is f a i t h fu l  to Austin's own views in much of - Howt o  Do Things w i t h  Words.)
Why should there be j u s t  three_ 1  -categories of speech act, rather than two or four?
Some schol-ars have suggested that the three-category analysis is incorr-ect; but I would support it.
Consider t he  various consequencesspeaking.
the first level, sound produced ; the pro-duction of this sound is a locutionary act.
If the sound is awell-formed sentence of English which is defined by the  inputfunction f o r  the hearer's topicon state, then t ha t  sentenceproduce6 a specific effect on the  hearer's topicoll: the pro-duction of t h i s  effect  i s  an illocutionary act of the typedefined by the label of the topmost new referent.
Thus, if thesentence adds t o  the topicon a referent labelled assert the%Puw--'illocutionary act is one of assertion; the 'misfiring' of anillocutionary act ,  as when a sentence syntactically in declar-ative form fails -t:o make an assertion because one of i t s  defin-ite descriptions f a i l s  to r e f e r ,  corresponds to failure tocreate an assert referent i n  the hearer's topicon.
(We have-seen that, when a subordinate node cannot be evaluated, process-ing of the phrase-marker s tops . )
The new topicon state maylead other t opicon states perhaps, to actions thehearer's part ,  via the successor-state relation: the product-ion  of such effects  may be identified with Austin's perlocution-ary acts.
My theory predicts that the illocutionary force ofa given sentence should be well-defined and drawn f rom a finiteclass of illocutionary types (corresponding to the possiblel abe l s  of sentent ia l  phrase-marker r o o t s ) ,  while (since ma;is non-deterministic) the perlocutionary e f f e c t s  may be manyand various; t h i s  seems to accord with Austin's discussion.
3222.
Having presented my theory and discussed the respectsin which it seems successful, I must now discuss i t s  many inad-equacies.
Some aspects of English have been omitted from thepresent account simply for the sake of brevity; I believethere is no d i f f i c u l t y  of principle in expanding my account tohandle e.g.
plurality, co-ordination yvith and, prepositions,-adverbs, modality, and most subordinate clauses.
But  a numberof English constructions present greater problems.
These -include, f o r  instance, negation and universal quantification.
33For negation, one might th ink  of treating no t .
a s  a monadic-predicate whose argument is a proposition, so that,  e.g., John-did not b z  a car would have the same effect on a hearer's0vuu'-- M -topicon as - John b a  a oar, followed by the creation of a0 - M M3 2 ~ n  the framework of my theory, the ~locutionary/illocut-ionary distinction becomes rather parallel to the distinctionbetween seein and seein as which exercised Wittgenstein andother ph dosop ears.
*e duck-rabbit picture (cf.
Hansonl958) if light reflectedprom that picture stimulates my o p t i cI eee it as a duck, if this stimulation leads to the :::;ion of a ~ ( Z E C I ~ )  - re*erent in topicon.33The fact that these two constructions should both beproblematic i s  no coincidence.
We can handle sentences whosetranslations i n t o  predicate calculus involve existential'quant-i f ica t ion ,  e.g.
'&r)(c(x) & b(;i, 5) ) '  f o r  J b a t  a car;' -3x-@ is interchangeiibre wiFh x , 80, i& could h g n Gnegarion, we should be able to ha'dle universal quantification.not referent dominating the b x  r e f e ren t  just created.
ButF-f"then it would make sense t o  speak of the s r  which John didn'thML 7--b x  , n whereas i n  i t s  commoner sense John did not b s  a car does --- --not imply the existence of any par t icular  unbought car.
Again,one might think of interpreting e.g.
All love John as0uu-- --creating a love referent  dominating each pair (r r ) of r e fe r -- -1 ' -2ents in the hearer's topicon such that r is ( r )  and r-1 7 -2i s  the referent representing John.
But t h i s  would be qui teinadequate: t h e  sentence i s  about, not the par t i cu la r  g i r l sthe hearer knows of when he hears it u t t e r ed ,  but  a l l  g i r l swhatsoever.
A related point is that the  meory  does not handlethe generic sense of definite NPs, as* The ele_phant is a- .. - M L -noble beast.--34 Other d i f f i c u l t i e s  are  with yes/no questions,the between and i n t e r p r e t -ations of complement clauses (- d* - was u a t e d  v.dancin@; - was ) with t r F - f u n c t i o n a l  connectivessuch as if, or, with conjunctions such as but v. and,rm, An+ - -v. because whose appropriateness depends on a given proposition7const i tut ing evidence for or against the truth of another, andwith comparative and superlative constructions.
9>340ne approach to these problems might involve introducingreferents representing muniversalsf (in the  l o g i c a l  sense), sothat for an individual referent t o  have the  proper ty  ?
(gir l )or g ( e ~ )  would be f o r  that re fe ren t  t o  be one of m u n -ordere s e t  of individual  referents dominated by the referentrepresenting the universal irl or e-t (in which case thenotion of 'labelling' proposl % xonal referents might be dropped).Then the propositional referent created by All irls l o v  Johnwould l i n k  the re fe ren t  representing the  unlversa -+?F w i  ht he  individual  referent $or John.
It remains to be seen whetheran adequate eolution can be produced along these lines.
"I am not  sure whether the opaque/transparent referencedistinction belongs on t h i s  list.
I am incl ined to explain theAnother deficiency of the present theory is that the reare phrase-markers generated by (17) whose effects  are  notspecified by R1-10, e.g.
phrase-markers in which NP is rewrit-ten wh S. I hope tha t  an account of the  unexplained construct-ions in the  above list may turn out to involve uses for thephrase-markers which are not handled by R1-10, but I have noidea whether this will be so,23.
I am not at present clear how to adapt my theory to acc-ount for these constructions, and, since they include some verybasic ones, my discussion of the nature of the automaton under-lying a hearer's linguistic a b i l i t i e s  may be worthless.
How-ever, although my theory may be rejected, it would seem t h a tthere must be some adequate theory of the  human comprehensionof language in terms of automata whose states are  of finitecomplexity.
An account "of natural-language semantics in termsof infinitely large sets  of, in general, infinitely complexpossible  worlds cannot be the whole t r u t h  about how finitehuman beings understand language.
I hope, therefore, that theinadequacies of the above account may spur others  to improve onmy work.two senses of e.g.
