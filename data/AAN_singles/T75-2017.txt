III!iIlIII!II!IIIIIA FORMALISM FOR RELATINGLEXICAL AND PRAGMATIC INFORMATION:ITS RELEVANCE TO RECOGNITION AND GENERATION*Aravind K. Joshi**Stanley J. Rosenschein**I. INTRODUCTIONIn this paper we shall report on aninitial attempt to relate the representationproblem for four areas to each other throughthe use of a uniform formal structure.
Thefour areas we have been concerned with are:(I) interpretation of events(2) initiation of actions(3) understanding language(4) using languageFinding such a representation would beextremely useful and very suggestive eventhough it would not by itself constitute asolution to the whole problem.Clearly, (I) and (2) are "pragmatic" innature and are not limited to naturallanguage processing, while (3) and (4) maybe viewed as special cases of (I) and (2)respectively.
One of our main goals is toshow how both pragmatic and semantic issuesmay be approached in a formal framework.
Wehave chosen to study the area of "speechacts" (conversational activities like"request," "command," "promise," ...) asthis area is especially rich in interactionsamong the four areas.Our goals can be divided into twocategories: operational and methodological.On the operational side, we want toimplement an actual system which wouldrecognzze" and "perform" speech acts andwhich would use and understand the verbs of"saying'.
The recognition that a particularspeech act has occurred is to be on thebasis of context and not solely on explicitmarkers like a performative verb or aquestion mark.
We also want a symmetricsystem which could generate, in the contextof reversed roles, anything it couldunderstand.
Initially we would be satisfiedthat the input and output be in anartificial language which we felt to beadequate to represent the underlyingstructures of English sentences (I).On the methodological side, we have twoprimary desiderata: unformity ofrepresentation, and generality in theprocedural component.
We do not wish towrite an intricate procedure for each speechact.
We want to represent the speech actsin a structure with useful formalproperties.

RELATED RESEARCH (2)This work cuts across several areas inlinguistics, natural language processing,and artificial intelligence and is relatedto work done on "lexical factorization" bycertain generative semanticists and others.Here, as there, the attempt was to decomposethe meanings of various predicates intocombinations of a small group of "corepredicates" or "primitives'.
However,whereas in general the decomposition wasallowed to be expressed in any suitable form(trees, dependency networks, ...) we shalldecompose into a slightly extended predicateca lcu lus  in order to exploit the underlyingBoolean algebra and ultimately to constructour derived lattice.At this point, we should mention tworelated pieces of work.
First, the notionof using lattices for "recognizing" or"characterizing" events is an extension ofsome ideas of Tidhar \[T74\] (see also \[BT75\])who app l ied  the principle to visualrecognition of shapes.
Also, Smaby's work\[$74\] on presupposition makes considerableuse of lattice constructions, after DanaScott, in a somewhat related spirit.III.

Some examples are\[B75\], \[F71\], \[JM75\], \[J74\], \[KP?5\],\[Sch73\], \[Sc72\], \[St74\], \[W72\].the lexical decomposit ions (definitions) andcertain other elements while the LEXICONcontains the non-def in i t ional  information.The LEXICON and SCHEMATA remain fixed durin~the course of the conversation.
The "stateor "instantaneous descr ipt ion" of the systemis to be found in the BELIEFS and GOALS,which are constant ly being updated as theconversat ion progresses.In order to avoid confusion, we shouldpoint out that in our discussion of thesystem, "beliefs" and "goals" are meant astechnical  terms to be defined entirely bytheir function in the system.
These termsare not to be confused with theircorresponding lexical items.
We shall havemore to say about "goals" later, but for nowwe will concentrate on "beliefs'.At any given time, the system has asits "beliefs" a set of proposit ions in apredicate calculus sl ightly modif iedpr imari ly  to al low for sentence embeddings.This set has the fol lowing properties:(i) closure -- if a proposit ion is in thebel ief set, then all its directconsequences (i.e., those fol lowingfrom the def init ions of the lexicalitems) are also in the bel ief set.
(2) consistency -- the Boolean product ofthe proposit ions in the belief setcannot be the element "false'.In order to br ief ly i l lustrate theserestr ict ions, consider the definit ion:bachelQr (x) =~ man (x) & - marr ied (x),and the fo l lowing sets:(1) {bachelor( John),  man(John)}(2) {bachelor( John),-married(John),  -man(John)}(3) {bachelor( John),-marr ied(John)}man(John),man(John),Set (I) is not closed; set (2) is notconsistent.
Set (3) is closed andconsistent and is thus a valid bel ief set.Note that the direct consequencerelat ion defines a partial  order over theproposit ions.
The addit ion of proposit ionswhich are direct consequences of aproposit ion containing a defined predicate,we call EXPANSION.
There is anotheroperat ion which is something of an inverseof EXPANSION: Given a valid set of beliefs,this operaton augments the bel ief set withthe least summariz ing expression(s) havingas consequences any two-or-more elementsubset of the or iginal  beliefs.
Thisoperat ion we call SYNTHESIS.
For instance,given the set{man(John), -marr ied(John)}the performance of SYNTHESIS would yield theset{bachelor(John),-marr ied(John)}.man(John),In this example, the original setcorresponded exactly to the clauses of the80definit ion, but in general this would not bethe case; other bel iefs might also beentai led by the added proposit ion(s),  andthese would also have to be added.
(Closureand consistency must stil l  be preserved.
)The next section dealsoperatons can be definedimpl icat ions are forunderstanding system.with how suchand what theira f lexibleIV.
BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS AND LATTICESWe begin by giving a brief exposit ionof Boolean algebras as represent inginformation states to be fol lowed by anexplanat ion of how, by construct ing alattice substructure, we can formalize thenotion of matching a pattern on incompleteinformation.
The lattice will supply aninternal  c r i ter ion  for deciding when thereis enough information for a match.Assume we are given a f inite set of(primitive) predicates, each of knowndegree.
Assume further that thesepred icates  are to be appl ied to a f inite setof constants.
A predicate of degree nadjoined to n constants is an atomicproposit ion, and the negation symbolattached to an unnegated atomic proposit ionalso yields an atomic proposit ion.
We canthink of all atomic sentences, theirconjunct ions and disjunctions, together witha "greatest" element * and a ~least" element0, as forming a Boolean algebra, Bool.
Inthis algebra eery element (except * and 0)is wr i t ten as a sum-of-products of atomicproposit ions.We define the " less-than-or-equal"relat ion (~) as follows:(I) ~ x~ Bool, x~*(2) W x~ Bool, 0~x(3) If x is a product term x~x~...x~ and yis a product term y~y~,.
.
.
,y~ then x~yiff Wx~ ~ Yi such that x~ is identicalto y~ (i.e., the l i terals of x are asubset of the l i terals of y).
(4) If s is a sum-of -products  term s~ + s z +?
.. + so and ti is a sum-of -productsterm t~ + t z + ... + t~ then s~t iffV t~ ~ s~ such that ~t~.Fol lowing Dana Scott \[Sc72\], we identi fy themeet (M) with d is junct ion of elements andthe join (u) with conjunction.
With thisconvent ion we get the interpretat ion that aswe go "upward" in the structure we getelements containing more information.
Themaximal element, *, is "overdetermined" inthe sense that it contains "too much"information; it is sel f -contradictory.Conversely, the lower elements in thestructure contain less information, with theminimal element, 0, containing noinformat ion at all.
These notions arepresented graphica l ly  in Figure 2.IIICONJUNCTION OF CONDIT IONS *MORE INFORMATION / ~ ~MORE SPECIFIC pq ~pq p~q ~p~qFEWER "POSSIBLE WORLDS" ~ ~ ~ l qMORE "POSSIBLE WORLDS" 0\[p and q are two proposit ions\]Figure 2Bool was constructed over fullyinstant iated proposit ions, and as such itwould not be of direct use in "patternmatching.
By adopting certain conventionshaving to do with variables and theirsubstitutions, we can define T, the Booleanalgebra of predicates (or uninstant iatedlogical forms), which, of course, wouldbecome Bool if constants were to replace thevariables.
It is from this structure T,that we construct the latt ice of schemata.The construct ion of this latt iceproceeds as follows.
We select from theBoolean algebra T those points whichcorrespond to combinat ions of condit ionswhich we wish to have serve as "paradigms"or "schemata'.
The choice of these pointshas to do with the empir ical  question ofwhat clusters, of propert ies and relationsare of cognit ive signif icance, which areEXPANSION's of lexical items, and so on.Any arbitrary set of points drawn fromT can be completed to a lattice L by addingaddit ional  points from T such that fo r  anytwo points x t and xz in L, x ~  x L wil lalso be in L. While this is the generalprocedure, we have been working pr imari lywith latt ices that have no elements -- otherthan 0 -- that are str ict ly less than theelements corresponding to atomic predicates.We write A(x) if x is an element of T and xcorresponds to an atomic predicate.
Wewrite ~(x) if there exists a y such thatA(y) and y~x.
That is, ~(x) if x is "atleast atomic'.The ~ relation is inherited direct lyfrom T, as is the operation ~ (3).However, the operation differs in that,intuit ively, one may get out more than wasput in.
That is, in T if t~ and t z areproduct terms and t,~-~ t, = t, then for anyelement t" such that A(t') if t'~t, theneither t'~tt or t'~t~.
However, in L thisis not always the case.
For example, in(3) In the case of a latt ice in which forall elements x, other than 0, A(x) is true,the fo l lowing modi f icat ion is necessary: Ifx~ ~ x~: a, and ~~(a) then x1~ L xz : O~otherwise x, ~L  x% = X, ~ X~.81Figure 3, A~ B = S~, and clearly C~S~ andD~S~ , while C and D are not comparable toeither A or B.
Thus, while in T we couldmove our information state "forward', in Lwe can move forward and reasonably extendour information beyond what was str ict lygiven.\Figure 3Intuit ively speaking, we have absorbed thenon-paradigmat ic  information states toparadigm points; ~L  corresponds to "jumpingto a conclusion" -- but only to the leastconclusion which is needed to explain thegivens.
The cr i ter ia for how much to extendare in the structure itself.The actual computat ion of x L.~Ly is notdiff icult, given that we have ~ and ~ fromT.
One method fol lows from the observat ionthat the least upper bound is the greatestlower bound of all upper bounds and thatX~-~y~x~Ly.
By this method one firstcomputes t, the least upper bound in T.(This is straightforward,  asT  is a Booleanalgebra.)
Set r to *.
Then for each elementx of L for which t~x, set r to r~x .
Whenwe exhaust all such x, the value of r willbe the least upper bound.
Of course, othermore eff ic ient methods for computing thel.u.b, also exist.The mechanism for event interpretat ionoperates in the fol lowing manner.
The leastupper bound is taken of the points in thelatt ice which, under variable substitution,correspond to the proposit ions in the bel iefset and proposit ions in some input set.
Anymatched schemata (and their consequences)are added to the bel ief  set.
If the leastupper bound taken in this way turns out tobe *, one of two things has occured.
Eitherthe bel ief set contained a proposit ion whichcontradicted an input proposit ion, (thebel ief set, one should recall, could neverbe sel f -contradictory) ,  or there is nosingle schema which encompasses all theproposit ional  information.
In the formercase, a control  decis ion must be made on howto integrate the new material  into thebel ief set.
In the  latter case, we use theoperat ion "general ized LUB', which returns aset of points, each of which is a l.u.b.for a subset of the proposit ions.V.
L INGUISTIC RELEVANCEAs was noted before, an attempt wasmade to correlate the schemata with lexicaldecomposit ions of Engl ish words, especial lythe verbs of "saying'.
It can be seen thatdef in i t ional  direct consequences (a type ofentai lment) corresponds precisely to therelation.
That is, the fact that a sentenceusing the defined predicate bache!en has manas its direct consequence implies that thepoint in L into which man is mapped isless - than-or -equal - to  (~) the point intowhich bachelor is mapped.
If we labelpoints in the lattice with items from thelexicon, we get structures similar to theone shown in Figure 4.
Detai led informationabout the arguments of each predicate hasbeen left out for the sake of readabil ity.\%his  ?
I REQUEST ~ PRO\ ATEX(KNOW SAY KNOW AS-A- IFigure 4.The reason for embedding lexical items inthe lattice is that the l.u.b, operat ioncan be used to choose appropr iate words todescribe a s i tuat ion (given as a "beliefset').
That is, we want the act of wordselect ion to be identi f ied with an operat ionthat is natural ly suggested by the formalstructure.
The select ion of groups of wordsis ident i f ied with the "general ized LUB.
"One interest ing chal lenge emanatingfrom this approach was to find a way inwhich wel l -known semantic propert ies oflexical items, such as inducedpresupposit ions,  could be integrated intothe framework.
For this purpose weintroduced a new connective, @, whosebehavior is i l lustrated in Figure 5.e & N ~ ~  /\ - -> / \P A P A"WEAK" NEGATIO_ N not &@ - -> -/ \  tP A P A"STRONG" NEGATIO_ N (DeMorgan's Law)neg V, / \, > \] / \P A P AFigure 5If ~ is taken to be the presupposit ion and Athe assertion, then the two negationrewrit ings correspond to the usualunderstanding of presupposit ion.
Howeverboth can be expressed as points in theBoolean algebra.
Furthermore, if S is asentence rewritten as a 9 b, then neg(S)not(S) (since ~a + ~b ~ a & ~b. )
Also, ifA(a) and A(b) (i.e., if a and b are atomic)then S and not(S) are higher in the latt icethan the atomic sentences, but neg(S) islower.Recal l ing that moving upward in thestructure is related to more specif icinformat ion,"  some light is cast on thefunction of presupposit ion as al lowing thegeneral direct ion of information to bepreserved even under negation of a sentencecontaining a complex predicate.
If therewere no presupposi t ional  convention, wewould move downward in information, since weknow only that some component in the complexis false.
With presupposit ions,  however, weknow exactly which compQnent is to benegated, so we keep the conjunct ion ofclauses and hence move "upward."VI.
THE INITIATON OF EVENTSUnder the appropr iate interpretat ion ofthe schemata we can represent how goals areset, changed, and accomplished.
Theessential  notion is that a schema canrepresent a conjunct ion of pre-condit ions,actions, and post-condit ions.
In thiscircumstance, if the "belief set" and the"goal set" sat isfy enough pre- andpost-condit ions respect ive ly  for apart icular  schema to be matched by thel.u.b, operation, then the action may betaken.
Of course, in the case of completeinformat ion (perfect match) the use of theschemata reduces to condit ional  expressionsand as such is suff ic ient to represent anysequence of act ions -- or to perform anycomputation.
What is more interesting,however, is how the latt ice provides a modelof " intel l igent" or "appropriate" choice ofact ions in the case of incompleteinformation.
In this context, too, the"general ized LUB" plays a role, namely thatof select ing several compatible actions tobe performed.82VII.
CONCLUSIONWe have attempted to show how thelatt ice operat ions can be used in a var ietyof c losely re lated l inguist ic and art i f ic ia linte l l igence contexts in such a way as toexploit  the re lat ionships effectively.
Whathas not been shown here is the controlstructure which sequences the operat ions ofinterpretat ion and in i t iat ion of events( including l inguist ic events).
Atheoret ica l ly  sat is fy ing strategy has notyet been sett led upon, though we have beenexplor ing the impl icat ions of severalcandidate strategies.
These strategies,together with the formal operat ionsdescribed above, are being implemented inLISP, and pre l iminary results suggest thatsuch a lat t ice-st ructured system is feasibleIIIlIi!Ii!,|IIIIIl!IIand very promising.REFERENCES\[B75\] Bruce, B.
