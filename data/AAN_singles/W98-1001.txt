Discovering Lexical Information byTagging Arabic Newspaper TextSaleem Abuleil Martha EvensCSAM, Illinois Institute of Technology10 West 31 Street, Chicago IL 60616abulsal@charlie.cns.iit.edu mwe@math.nwu.eduABSTRACTIn this paper we describe a system for buildingan Arabic lexicon automatically by taggingArabic newspaper text.
In this system we areusing several techniques for tagging the words inthe text and figuring out their types and theirfeatures.
The major techniques that we are usingare: finding phrases, analyzing the affixes of thewords, and analyzing their pattems.
Propernouns are particularly difficult to identify in theArabic language; we describe techniques forisolating them.INTRODUCTIONA lexicon is considered to be the backbone ofany natural language application.
It is anessential basis for parsing, text generation, andinformation retrieval systems.
We cannotimplement any of these applications or others inthe natural language area without having a goodlexicon.
All natural anguage processing systemsneed a lexicon full of explicit information\[Ahlswede and Evens, 1988; Byrd et al, 1987McCawley, 1986\].
The best way to find thenecessary lexieal information, we believe, is toextract it automatically from text.We are developing a part-of-speech tagger forArabic newspaper text.
We are testing it on acorpus developed by Ahmad Hasnah \[1996\]based on text given to Illinois Institute ofTechnology, by the newspaper, Al-Raya,published in Qatar.
The questions we addresshere are how to build an efficient echniques forautomating the tagger system, what techniquesand algorithms can be used in finding the part ofspeech and extracting the features of the word.When it comes to the Arabic language there areproblems and challenges that are not present inEnglish or other European languages.Newspaper articles are full of proper nounsthat need special rules to tag them in the text,because the Arabic language does notdistinguish between lower and upper caseletters, which leave us with a big problem inrecognizing proper nouns in Arabic text.The lack of vowels in the text we are usingcreates big problems of ambiguity.
Differentvowels change the word from noun to verband from one t39e of noun to another; theyalso change the meaning of the word.
Forexample, the following two words have thesame letters with the same sequence but withdifferent vowels.
The result is differentmeanings., ";~ k(a)t(a)b wrote' "< k(u)t(u)b booksMost published Arabic text is not vowelizedwith the exception of the Holy Quran andbooks for children.Some words in Arabic text begin with one,two, three, or four extra letters that constitutearticles or prepositions.
For example, thefollowing word consists of two parts: theparticle (a preposition letter) that is attachedto the beginning of the noun while it is notpart of it and the noun itself.
(on occasion) ".-q~t~.
-~ ~ + ".-q~tz,We need to identify these cases in the text anddeal with them in a perceptive way.In this paper we are trying to find answers tothese challenges through building a tagger systemwhose main function is to parse an Arabic text,tag the parts of speech, and find out their featuresto build a lexicon for this language.
Three maintechniques used in this system for tagging thewords are: finding phrases (verb phrases, nounphrases, and proper noun phrases), analyzing theaffixes of the word, and analyzing its pattern.1.
TAGGING VERB AND NOUNThere are several signs in the Arabic languagethat indicate whether the word is a noun or averb.
One of them is the affix of the word: someof the affixes are used x~ith verbs; some of themare used with nouns; and some of them are usedxvith verbs and nouns.
A lot of research projectshave used this technique to find the part ofspeech of a word.
Andrei Mikheev \[1997\] used atechnique for fully automatic acquisition of rulesthat guess possible part-of-speech tags forunknown words using their starting and endingsegments.
Several types of guessing rules areincluded: prefix morphological rules and suffixmorphological rules.
Zhang and Kim \[1990\]developed a system for automated learning ofmorphological word function rules.
This systemdivided a string into three regions and inferredfrom training examples their correspondence tounderlying morphological features.
Moreadvanced word-guessing methods use wordfeatures such as leading and trailing wordsegments to determine possible tags for unknownwords.
Such methods can achieve betterperformance, reaching a tagging accuracy of upto 85% on unknown words for English \[Brill1992; Weischedel et al, 1993\].
Another sign thatindicates whether a word is a noun or a verb isthe pattern.
In the Arabic language the patternsfunction as an important guide in recognizing thetype of the word; some of these patterns are usedjust for nouns; some of them are usedjustforverbs; and others are used for both nouns andverbs.
One more sign comes from grammaticalrules; several grammatical rules can be used todistinguish between ouns and verbs, some lettersin the Arabic language (letters of signification aresimilar to prepositions in the English language)mark the nouns; others mark the verbs2.
TAGGING PROPER NOUNSConstructing lexical entries for proper nouns isnot less important han defining and analyzingcommon nouns, verbs, and adjectives forsupporting natural language applications.
Thesemantic ategories of proper nouns are crucialinformation for text understanding \[Wolinski etal., 1995\] and information extraction \[Cowieand Lehnert,1996\].
They are also used ininformation retrieval systems \[Paik et al,1993\].A number of studies have shown the usefulnessof lexical-semantic relationships in informationretrieval systems \[Evens et al, 1985; Nutter etal., 1990; Abu-Salem, 1992\].
The lexical-semantic relationships are also important in otherapplications like question-answering systems\[Evens and Smith, 1978\].
Rau \[1991\] argues thatproper nouns not only account for a largepercentage of the unkno~aa words in a text, butalso are recognized as a crucial source ofinformation in a text for extracting contents,identifying a topic in a text, or detecting relevantdocuments in information retrieval.
Wacholder\[1997\] analyzed the types of ambiguity -structural and semantic - that make the discoveryof proper names in the text difficult.
Jong-SunKim and Evens \[1995\] built a natural languageprocessing system for extracting personal namesand other proper nouns from the Wall StreetJournal.We have classified the proper nouns that wefound in the A1-Raya newspaper as follows:Personal names:proper occupation organization nationalitynounM.

):proper noun t.vpe related-toAmerican nationality AmericaArabic lan\[Tta\[e ArabsThe Arabic language does not distinguishbetween upper/lower case letters like the Englishlanguage.
So the proper nouns do not begin witha capital letter.
This makes it not nearly as easyto locate them in Arabic text as in English text.For this reason we will use another technique fortagging the proper nouns in the text.
Thistechnique depends on the ke}avords.
We havestudied, analyzed, and classified these ke3avords,to use them to guide us in tagging the propernouns in the text and figuring out the t319es, andthe features.
We have classified these keywordsas follows:?
Personal names (title): Mr. John Adams?
Personal names (job title): President John?
organization names:Northwestern University?
Locations (political names): State of Illinois?
Location (natural names): Lake Michigan?
Times: Month of September?
Products: IBM Computer?
Events: Exhibition of Egyptian books?
Category: Arabic LanguageWe have also developed a set of grammaticalrules to identify the proper noun phrases in thetext.
Example:PNP --> JIA --> A1 I A2AI --> ADFPNI ADFPNI ADFPNA2 -> ADJI ADJADFPN -> ~IK/W-TITLE APN-PERSONA2PN-PERSON\[ADJ.

TAGGER SYSTEMThis system consists of four main subsystemsbeside the database (lexicon):3Tokenizer System: This system locates adocument and isolates the words (tokens).Type-Finder System: The main function of thissystem is to get the token from the tokenizersystem, to get some information about it from themorphology analyzer system, to go throughseveral tests one by one until we find the part ofspeech of the word.Feature-Finder System: This system isresponsible for finding the features of the word(gender, number, person, tense).
It sends theword to the morphology analyzer system, getsback information about it, analyzes thisinformation, and figures out the features of theword.Morphology analyzer system: This system isused by both the t3q0e-finder system and thefeature-finder system to analyze the suffix andprefix of the word.
This system contains threesubprograms: one for nouns, one for verbs, andone for particles.
The main function of thesealgorithms is to isolate the affixes of the wordand find the gender, number, person, and tense.Database (the lexicon): We started from a handbuilt lexicon created by Khalid Alsamara \[ 1996\],which our system uses and constantly updates.The lexicon consists of the main table and severaltables connected to it one for verbs, one fornouns, one for particles.
We add several tablesfor proper nouns.I DOCUMENT \[,i,TYPE-FINDER SYSTEMI"SYSTEM F "ld MORPHOLOGY I ANALYZERSYSTEM4.
TOKENIZER SYSTEMWe have implemented an algorithm that canisolate the punctuation marks as well as isolatethe extra particles attached to the beginning ofthe word, while they are not part of it.
We haveclassified the words in the Arabic language intoeight categories with respect to their prefix.
Thissystem caries out three main steps: Isolate theword from the text, pass it to a certain algorithmto classify it, and with respect to thisclassification we run a certain algorithm togenerate he token.s.
TYPE-FINDER SYSTEMThis system goes through several tests starting bychecking the database, identifying the phrases,analyzing the affixes of the word, and analyzingits pattern.5.1 PHRASE-FINDER TESTAfter we check the database and discover thatour token is absent, we move to the second test.The phrase-finder test uses a set of grammaticalrules that identify the phrases in the text.
It looksfor the phrases (verb phrase, noun phrase, andproper noun phrase) in the text, analyzes themand figures out the part of speech of the word.Example:Mrs. Diana made her visit to the computerconference, that is being held.
for the first time inChicatmThis test determines the part of speech of all theunderlined words.NP -> PART-N NNP -9 PART-1 NNP --> ~.II NNP --> ~t .~4so .,~3., (conference)  is a nounPNP "-> KAV\[T:x, G:y\] P.N\[T:x, G:y\]PNP "-) ;,:..,~l \[T:person, G:feminine\]P.N\[T:person, G:feminine\]PNP --Y ;,.~1 \[T:person, G:feminine\]t~  \[T:person, G:feminine\]so Uha (Diana) is a proper noun, for afemale human being.5.2 CHECKING THE AFFIXPATTERNSIf the second test fails to identify the part ofspeech of our token, we continue to the third andthe four test in sequence, for these taro tests weare using two techniques: analyzing the affixes ofthe word and finding its patterns.First, we have classified affixes into two groups:?
affix rule (A): if an affix occurs in a word wecan surely determine the t3q)e of the wordwithout any doubt.Example:Prefix Suffix Type; I ,'d NOUNb I~  w~?
Affix rule (B): if an affix occurs in a word wecan usually ascertain the t3~e of the word.Example:Prefix Suffix Typeverb ,.e.,I ~ o J I  o~noun 1Second, we have collected one hundred and sixtythree patterns that cover the patterns in theArabic language, we have classified thesepattems according to the t3q~e of the word theyare used for (noun, verb, or noun and verb).Example:t.,h~l (anf91) JL~ (fgll) d.~t (aft91)used with verbd~ (fgal) ~ (rnf9Ua) ,&~ (fga~)used with noun(f91) d~t~ (fa91) ~ (tf91)used with noun and verb5.2.1 AFFIX-RULE-(A) TESTThis third test gets the affix of the word from themorphology analyzer system and checks theseaffixes with affix rule (A).
If there is a matchthen the test succeeds otherwise we continue tothe fourth test.Example:~L~" ~ ~ J_~ ~,~Mrs.
Diana made her visit to the computerconference, that is being held for the first time inChicago.This test determines the part of speech of all theunderlined words.word prefix suffix result;,_~1 dt \[e.I\] ; noun; , j~ .
~.
\[e.I\] ; noun5.2.2 PATTERN-AFFIX-RULE-(B)TESTThe fourth test uses a combination of affix rule(B) and the pattems of the word.
This test usesaffix rule (B) to support he decision that will betaken from the pattern technique.
It gets the affixof the word from the morphology analyzer5system, checks the affix with affix rule (B)tofind out if there is a match, finds the pattern ofthe word, analyzes it to find out the type that it isused for.
We then go through the following tableto get the final result for this test.Type of thetoken fromPATTERNSType of thetoken fromAFFIXRULE (B)XRESULTNOUN NOUNVERB X VERBNOUN/VERB X XFAIL X FAILSo if we have a certain token, its pattern shows itis a NOUN or VERB, and its affixes show it is aNOUN x~4th respect to affix rule (B), then withrespect to our table this token should be aNOUN.Example:Mrs. Diana made her visit to the computerconference, that is being held for the first time inChicago.This test determines the part of speech of all theunderlined words.RESULT FROMAffix rule (b)W S P Rc=.,13 cu - vRESULT FROM RPatternT PT R~J f91 v / n v ---W: word, S: suffix, P: prefix,R: result T: token, PT: pattern6.

CONCLUSIONWe badly need a large integrated comprehensivelexicon.
To achieve this goal we need to buildthis lexicon automatically.
To build such alexicon we are developing a part of speech taggerfor Arabic text that extracts features of the wordsencountered.
We have described three majortechniques that we are using in this paper: findingphrases, analyzing the affixes oftheword, andanalyzing its patterns.
We have classified theproper nouns in the Arabic language to differentcategories, we used a new technique to tag themfrom the Arabic text by using the ke3-words.
Wedeveloped a set of grammatical rules for thisreason.REFERENCESAbu-Salem, H., 1992, A Microcomputer BasedArabic Bibliography Information RetrievalSystem v, ith Relational Thesauri (Arabic-IRS).6Unpublished Ph.D. Dissertation, ComputerScience Department, Illinois Institute ofTechnology, Chicago, IL.Ahlswede, T.E., and Evens, M., 1988,"Generating a Relational Lexicon from aMachine Readable Dictionary", InternationalJoumal of Lexicography, Vol.
