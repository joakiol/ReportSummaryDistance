PROCESSING COMPLEX NOUN PHRASES IN A NATURALLANGUAGE INTERFACE TO A STATISTICAL DATABASEFred POPOWlCH, Paul MCFETRIDGE, Dan FASS, Gary HALLSchool of Computing Science / Centre for Systems ScienceSimon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada V5A 1S6AbstractAnalysis of a corpus of queries to a statistical databasehas shown considerable variation in the location andorder of modifiers in complex noun phrases.
Never-theless, restrictions can be defined on nominal mod-ification because of certain correspondences betweennominal modifiers and the role they fulfill in a statisti-cal database, notably that the names of database tablesand columns, and values of columns, are all determinedby the modifiers.
These restrictions are described.
In-corporating these restrictions into Head-Driven PhraseStructure Grammar (HPSG) has caused us to examinethe treatment ofnominal modification i HPSG.
A newtreatment is proposed and an implementation within anHPSG based natural language front-end to a statisticaldatabase isdescribed.1 IntroductionA prototype natural anguage front-end to statisticaldatabases i being developed as part of an Execu-tive Information System for Rogers Cablesystems, aCanadian cable television company.
The initial targetdatabase isthe Rogers Technical Operations Database,a relational database containing statistical data describ-ing aspects of the company's business related to cus-tomer service.The front-end employs an HPSG chart parser.
Thereaxe numerous variations of HPSG; we have chosen\[PS87\] since it is the most familiar and widely pub-lished.
Our results can be extended to other variations.In the spirit of HPSG, we have avoided a proliferationof grammar roles and kept them highly schematic.In developing the grammar for the queries in ourcorpus, we encountered a selection of interesting nounphrase constructions which caused us to examine thetreatment of adjunct modification of nominals withinHPSG.
This has resulted in a proposal which shouldbe of interest to other researchers developing naturallanguage interfaces.2 Complex NPs in QueriesWe began the project by collecting acorpus of 68 En-glish language queries from three senior executives atRogers.
Our corpus contains constructions paradig-matic of a wide selection of natural language queriesthat he executives would like to pose to their database.A selection of these queries are shown in (1-6).
(1) Give me the we.stem region outage log summary.
(2) Give me the system reliability performance.
(3) Compare the basic service problem statistics perthousand customers.
(4) Compare the terminal equipment problems.The sentences contain complex NP constructionsand there is a large amount of variation with respectto the location and ordering of the modifiers.
Forexample, most pre-nominal modifiers may also appearas post-nominal modifiers.
(5) Vancouver system reliability performance(6) system reliability performance for VancouverPrepositional phrases like for Vancouvercan beviewedas an abbreviated form of the prepositional phrase forthe Vancouver division.The NPs within these sentences contain agreat dealof syntactic ambiguity.
Consider the complex NP in(1).
The adjective western can either modify region oroutage or log or summary.
Similarly, region couldmodify any of the nominals appearing to its right.However, much of this syntactic ambiguity does notACRES DE COLING-92.

23-28, 1992have a semantic interpretation i the database seman-tics.
For example, (1) has only a single interpretationalthough there are numerous syntactic analyses.We have gone into detail about he corpus to showthe rich structure of noun phrases and to motivate thereasons for the design choices in our semantics andgrammar.3 Complex NPsin HPSG3.1 Overview of HPSGHPSG is one of the best known uni fication-based gram-mar formalisms.
It employs attribute value matrices(called signs) to represent lexical entries, grammarrules and principles.
HPSG borrows freely from otherformalisms.
For example, the treatment of syntacticcategories, syntactic features, and sonre of the prin-ciples are from generalized phrase structure grammar(GPSG) \[GKPS85\].
The main syntactic ategories inHPSG are heads (the head constituents of phrases),adjuncts (traditionally called modifiers) and comple-ments (traditionally called arguments).
The principlesof HPSG include the Constituent Order Principle, Sub-categorization Principle, Head Feature Principle, andSemantics Principle.HPSG contains three grammar rules for combiningheads with complements.
(7) \[SUBCAT (\[ \])\] --, H\[LEX+, INV- \ ] ,  C"(8) \[SUBCAT( )\] ~ a\[LEX-\ ] ,  C(9) \[SUBCAT( )\] --, H\[LEX+, INV +\], C*One rule (7) combines a lexical head with everythingbut its final complement.
This rule can also be usedto convert a lexical head requiring only a single com-plement into a non-lexical constituent s ill requitinga single complement.
Another ule (8) combines anon-lexical head with its final complements.
Yet an-other ule (9) works for inverted constructions: thoseinvolving a lexical head that is marked for inversion.As in GPSG, generalizations about he relative orderof sister constituents is factored out of the phrase struc-ture rules and expressed in independent linear prece-dence (LP) constraints.
The LP constraints are usedby the Constituent Order Principle.
HPSG roles areimmediate dominance (ID) rules.
Consequently, a sin-gle ID rule of the form X --, HA  could describe ahead constituent H either preceded or followed by anadjunct A - -  the relative ordering of H and A is deter-mined by the LP constraints.3.2 Issues in the Treatment of AdjunctsNominal modification is treated ill HPSG by havingheads that contain a set valued feature called AD-JUNCTS \[PS87\].
Each element of this set is a signwhich describes a potential adjunct.
For instance, theADJUNCTS feature for a noun will contain an entryfor adjectives, one for nouns, one for prepositionalphrases and one for verb phrases.An alternative, which was also discussed in \[PS87\]and has been adopted in other grammar formalisms(e.g., \[Usz86, CKZ88\]) and some variations of HPSG\[Coo90, Po191\], is to allow adjuncts to select theirheads, t The head feature called HEADS contains aset of descriptions, one for each construction that canbe modified by the adjunct.
For example, the HEADSfeature for an adjective will contain a sign for a noun.In our corpus, a head has more possible classesof modifiers than modifiers have classes of possibleheads.
For example, the set of modifiers for NPs andNs (i.e., NPs lacking determiners) includes adjectives,nominals, PPs and even VPs (relative clauses).
In ?3.4we shall see that each of these modifiers can have onlyone or two possible heads.
Furthermore, the task ofreducing the size of the HEADS or ADJUNC'rS set,by discovering common semantic features for whicha constituent can select, meets with greater success ifmodifiers elect heir heads.
That is, one is more likelyto find commonality among the constituents which anadjunct can modify than among the modifiers which ahead can take.
Selections of heads by adjuncts permitsa greater ange of subcategorization to be specifiedthrough default inheritance rather than explicit speci-fication.Some aspects of adjunct semantics arc impossibleif adjuncts are selected by heads rather than heads e-lected by adjuncts.
Predicates, both adjectives andverbs, have argument s ructure which coerces their ar-guments into thematic roles.
For exanlple, the adjec-tive modern imposes on its argument the thematic roleof Theme.
~ It is not obvious how the nonrinal argu-ment of the adjective receives its thematic role unlessit is the adjective which selects the nominal, parallel tothe assignment of thematic roles by verbs to their NParguments.
If modern selects its head, then the the?matic role of the head may be specified in the HEADSI Cooper ICoo90, Ch.3, ?6\] looks in some detail at the argumentsin favour of adjuncts selecting their heads.2In \[Po191, ?1.3\], Pollard and Sag introduce s mantic featureslike AGENT, GOAL andTHEME within the feature structure con-taining the semantic CONTENT.ACl'ES DE COL1NG-92, NANTI.

23-28, 1992attribute and inherited by the head when it unifies withthe HEADS attribute.
If instead, heads ubcategorizefor their adjuncts, this information must be inherited insome other fashion, perhaps through structure sharingfrom the adjuncts list.The problem and its solution are evident whenderivational morphology are considered.
The verbread imposes the thematic role of Agent (Ag) on itssubject and the thematic role of Theme (Th) on its ob-ject.
When this verb is coerced into an adjective bythe derivational suffix -able, the resulting adjective as-signs the thematic role of Theme to its argument.
Ifadjectives elect heir heads, then the derivational ruleis evident.
(lO) V\[SUBCAT (NPTh, NPAg)\]Adj q-"able"\[HEADS {NTh}\]Given that adjuncts will select heir heads, a gram-mar role for adjuncts can be stated most conciselyif we combine a head with a single adjunct at atime.
Thus, our constituent s ructures will contain anADJUNCT-DTR feature which will take the adjunct asits value, rather than a list-valued ADJUNCT-DTRSfeature which would take a list of adjuncts as its value.A head that is modified by more than one adjunct willrequire more than one application of the grammar rule.One disadvantage of this approach is that a com-plex nominallike system reliability for Vancouverwillhave two analyses: one where the PP for Vancouvermodifies the head noun reliability and another whereit modifies the head nominal system reliability.
If theadjuncts rule combined ahead with all of its adjunctsat the same time, there would be only one analysis.However, one could argue that there should be twointerpretations for the phrase and that both should bereflected in the grammar.
Pollard and Sag note that"there is evidence that noun-noun and adjective-nounstructures share some syntactic properties with lexicalnouns as opposed to typical common oun phrases,e.g.
they can occur themselves a  modifiers in noun-noun structures" \[PS87, p.73\].
They propose ana-lyzing noun-noun and adjective-noun constructions a\[LEX +\] even though they have internal structure.
Byadopting this treatment of complex noun phrases, wecan prevent analyses for ungrammatical onstructionslike system for Vancouver reliability, plus we can pre-vent ambiguity in the analysis of phrases like systemreliability for Vancouver.
In our grammar we introducetwo rules for adjuncts, which are designed to give widecoverage and to avoid spurious ambiguities.3.3 Two Rules for AdjunctsOne adjunct grammar rule is required for combiningsaturated lexical adjuncts with their heads.
That is, forlexical adjuncts which have empty subcategorizationlists, like adjectives, proper nouns (specifically, theproper nouns corresponding to months and cities) andadverbs.
The rule will be restricted so that it willapply to phrases with unsaturated heads.
Heads thatfall into this category are Ns, PPs, 3 VPs, and APs.
Thespecific pairing of adjuncts to heads is determined bythe HEADS feature of the adjunct (?3.4).
Additionally,if the head modified by the adjunct is marked \[LEX +\]then the resulting constituent will also be \[LEX +}, thusimplementing the analysis of adj-noun and noun-nounconstructions discussed in the previous ection.
Usingthe schematic notation for grammar rules introducedin \[PS87\], we can present the rule as shown in (11).
(11) \[SUBCAT(\[\]), LEX \[~\]\] --+ H\[LEX E\]\],A\[SUBCAT (), LEX +, HEADS {...H...}\]Note that the two appearances of \ [ \ ]  in (11) indi-cate that the head and the resulting constituent sharethe same value for their LEX features.
The Subcate-gorization Principle will ensure that the head and theresulting constituent will have the same value for theirSUBCAT features.
Since the grammar rule is an IDrule, it does not place any restriction on the linear or-dering of the head (H) and adjunct (A).
This rule isdesigned so that it applies before a head is combinedwith its final complement (8).
It can be viewed asthe HPSG counterpart to the adjunct rule from X-bartheory \[Cho82\] shown below, where the ADJUNCT isrequired to be lexical and not subcategoriz, e for anyarguments.
(12) X ---, X ADJUNCTin order for heads to be modified by unsaturatedadjuncts, we propose asecond grammar rule.
(13) \[SUBCAT(\[\]), LEX \ [ \ ] \ ]  ~ H\[LEX \ [ \ ] \ ] ,A\[SUBCAT (\[\]), LEX ~\ ] ,HEADS {...H...}\]~Like \[PS87, p.70\], we propose that propositions have twoelements on their subcategorization list, the first being the prepo-sitional object and the second its subject.
A PP is obtained bycombining a preposition with its object NE We do not proposelexical entries for prepositions having only the object NP on itsSUBCAT list since this would complicate he LP roles (~3.5) andgrammar rules (7) and (8).AO'ES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO(rl" 1992 4 8 PROC.

NAI'rrEs, AUG. 23-28, 1992Rule (13) requires the adjunct to have a single ele-ment in its SUBCAT list, thus allowing PR VP andmodiliers to modify PPs, VPs and Ns.
Of course,the contents of the HEADS feature will restrict the ap-plicabillty of this role (fi3.4).
Unlike rule (11) whichallowed a lexical adjunct o modify either a lexical ornon-lexical head, rule (13) requires the head, adjunctand resulting constituent to possess the same valuesfor their LEX features, as reflected by the coindexingwilh \[j_-\].
With this role, a "lexical" compound nouncan modify a lexical noun to yield a "lexical" com-pound noun (e.g., N -~ N, N), or a (non-lexical) PPcan nmdify a non-lexical nominal m yield a non-lexicalnonrinal (N -~ N, PP).Direct consequences of our two adjuncts ndes arethat prepositions and verbs are not allowed to modifyanything (these have two or nrore elements in theirSUBCAT lists), sentences or complex noun phrasescannot appear as adjuncts, and NPs, Ss, adjectives,verbs and prepositions cannot be modi fled by anything.Our grammar does not prevent nouns from being mod-ified, since rule (7) can be applied to a lexical noun toyield a non-lexical nominal (essenti',dly, N ~ N).
Ifwe "allowed full NPs or Ss to be modified, the resultwould be a syntactic ambiguity which would not haveany semantic relevance.3.4 The HEADS FeatureThe applicability of the two adjuncts grammar olesis restricted by the value of the HEADS feature ofthe adjunct.
For prepositions (lexical entries withSYNILOCIHEADIMAJ = P), the value of the HEADSfeature will be a set containing a sign for N con-stituents (N\[SUBCAT (\[\]), LEX- \ ] )  and a sign forVP constituents.
4 Lexical entries for nouns and adjec-tives will have a single element in their HEADS set.It will contain a sign for lexical nouns, which inchtdescompound nouns (N\[SUBCAT (\[ \]), LEX +\]).
We areproposing that pre-nominal lnodifiers, like adjectivesand (compound) nouns, will be combined with theirhead nouns before post-nominal modifiers, like PPs.We adopted this decision because applying modifiersin different orders does not result in any differencein the resulting semantic interpretation.
Specifically,the semantic representation associated with \[the \[lsys-tern reliability\] for Vancouverl\] is the same as that4In our corpus PPs do not appear to nlodify any VPs, so we canactually simplify the HEADS feature so that it contains only the Nentry.for \[\[the \[system liabilityl\] lot Vancouverl and \[theIsystem \[reliability tbr Vancouverlll.
With our pro-posal, we obtain only one analysis tot the phrase dis-cussed alx~ve.
Finally, in order to allow relative clauses(MAJ=V), we need only propose that they contain asign for N in their HEADS set.
Ttms, we effectivelytreat relative clauses like restrictive relative clauses.As was the case with PP adjtmcts, the same seman-tic representation is obtained regardless of whether therelative clause modifies an N (restrictive relative) oran NP (non-restrictive r lative).3.5 Linear PrecedenceWe adopt the same LP constraints for heads and com-plement danghters as proposed in \[PS87\].
Lexicalheads are required to precede their cmnplement(s),while non-lexical heads tollow their complement(s).Sister cmnplements appear in the reverse order of theirappearance in tim SUBCAT list of flmir head.
The I,Pconstraints lot adjuncts require signs with MAJ -A  orMAJ :N (+N categories in terms of the chtssificationpresent in \[Cho821) to precede their beads, while ad-juncts with MAJ=V or MAJ=P ( -N  categories) arerequired to follow their heads.
Thus adjectives andnominal modifiers will precede the nouns they modify,while PPs and relative clauses will follow the con-stituenls they modify.3.6 SemanticsDue to the close relationship between syntax and se-mantics in HPSG, we can avoid syntactic ambiguitieswhich do not con'espond to distinct semantic analyses.Semantic infomlation, consisting n fTYPE and content(CONT), can be used to prevent ceIl.ain analyses.
TheTYPE of a complex constituent will be tbe san~e as thatof its head.
The Semantics Principle is responsible forcreating the CONT of a complex constituent from thatof its daughters (suhconsfituents) \[PS871.
We adopt aversion of this principle for building up semanlic in-formation for database stntctures, which we call theDatabase (DB) Semantics Principle \[McE911.We incorporate selectiomd restrictions based on asemantic type hierarchy which incoq~orates a pects ofthe database design.
The Rogers Technical Opera~tions Database is a statistical database; that is, eachtable in the database contains one or motx: category at-tributes (columns) whose values define sets of entitiesof a single type, and one or more statistic attributes(columns) whose values smnmarizc these sets.

.Figure 1 : Semantic Type ttierarchycomplex noun phrases used in natural language queriesto this database consist of nominals, or nominal mod-ifiers which belong to five general classes: statisticaltype (stype), statistical set (sset), entity set (eset), mod-ifier (mud) and pre-moditier (pmod).
Each of theseclasses may be divided into subclasses u ing informa-tion from the conceptual database design.
These fiveclasses are arranged in a semantic type hierarchy asshown in Figure 1.
Using this hierarchy, we can incor-porate selectional restrictions into the HEADS featureof modifiers.
Nouns like summary, sum, and ratio areused to refer to particular (sets of) statistics.
Membersof the sset class (e.g., log, performance, activity) maybe used to modify stypes.
Nouns from the sset classmay be semantically vacuous, that is, we assume thatall requests are forsome set of statistics and these nounsmay not carry any information that can help identifythe particular statistics ought by a user.
We allow(compound) nouns within the eset class (e.g., problem,outage, call, reliability) to modify (compound) nounsof type star (i.e., sset or stype).
Adjuncts of type roodmay modify subclasses of eset.
For example, a usercan request either system reliability .statistics or servicec~dls.
The type proud may modify other modifiers andselected types of eset.The selectional restrictions distilled from our typehierarchy are by themselves not powerful enough toeliminate all of the "spurious" ,ambiguities.
Just aswe can use the TYPE feature from the semantics ofthe sign, we can also use the CONT to restrict possibleanalyses.
To do this, we have modified the DB Seman-tics Principle with an Adjunct Contribution Constraintso that an adjunct is required to contribute semanticinformation to a head-adjunct onstituent - - in partic-ular, adjuncts must contribute references to databaseconstructs - - hence the constraint disallows emanti-cally vacuous adjuncts from combining with a head.A complex constituent like outage log summary, inwhich outage has semantic ontent but log makes nocontribution ofdatabase information, would have onlyone analysis.
The noun log would not be allowed toSent Parse Total Edges(1) 14 (33) 19 (43) 99 (153)(2) 5 (6) 7 (8) 58 (65)(3) 12 (21) 16 (27) 96 (125)(4) 5 (5) 8 (8) 60 (60)Table 1: Parsing Performancemodify summary, but outage could modify log, andthen outage log could modify summary.4 ImplementationOur treatment of complex NPs has been incorporatedinto the SX natural anguage interface \[MC90\].
TheSX system uses grammar developed within the HPSG-PL grammar development system \[PV91a\].
The se-mantic representations built up by an HPSG parser aredirected to a module which converts them into an SQLquery.
The query can then be directed to an Oracledatabase to obtain the requested information.SX makes use of chart parsing implementations ofHPSG developed in LISP by McFetridge \[MC90\] andin Prulog by Popowich and Vogel \[PV91 b\].
Chart pars-ing is a type of parsing in which all syntactic structureswhich are built are placed on a single graph struc-ture called a chart.
Nodes in the chart correspond topositions in an input sentence, with edges between thenodes describing analyses ofsubstringsofthe input.
Asuccessful parse corresponds to an edge that spans theentire input sentence.
The performance of the Prologparser on sentences (1)-(4) are summarized in Table1.
For each sentence, the table shows the time in CPUseconds for obtaining the first parse (Parse) and forsearching for all possible interpretations (Total).
Thetable also contains the number of edges created bythe chart parser while searching for these interpreta-tions.
To illustrate the effect of the Adjunct Contribu-tion Constraint discussed in ?3.6, Table 1 also shows(in brackets) the number of edges and CPU times whenthis constraint is not used.
The tests were performedon a SUN SPARCstation 1 running Quintus Prolog 3.0.5 DiscussionNatural anguage interfaces to statistical databases arestill rare but, with the growing interest in Executive In-formation Systems and increasing needs of executivesto have immediate access to summary (i.e., statistical)ACYES DE COL1NG 92.
