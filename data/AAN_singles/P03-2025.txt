A two-stages translation modelis proposed for the acquisition of bilin-gual terminology from comparable cor-pora, disambiguation and selection of besttranslation alternatives according to theirlinguistics-based knowledge.
Different re-scoring techniques are proposed and eval-uated in order to select best phrasal trans-lation alternatives.
Results demonstratethat the proposed translation model yieldsbetter translations and retrieval effective-ness could be achieved across Japanese-English language pair.1 IntroductionAlthough, corpora have been an object of study ofsome decades, recent years saw an increased inter-est in their use and construction.
With this increasedinterest and awareness has come an expansion in theapplication to knowledge acquisition, such as bilin-gual terminology.
In addition, non-aligned com-parable corpora have been given a special inter-est in bilingual terminology acquisition and lexicalresources enrichment (Dejean et al, 2002; Fung,2000; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1999).This paper presents a novel approach to bilin-gual terminology acquisition and disambiguationfrom scarce resources such as comparable corpora,phrasal translation through re-scoring techniques aswell as evaluations on Cross-Language InformationRetrieval (CLIR).
CLIR consists of retrieving docu-ments written in one language using queries writtenin another language.
An application is completed ona large-scale test collection, NTCIR for Japanese-English language pair.2 The Proposed Translation Model inCLIRFigure 1 shows the overall design of the proposedtranslation model in CLIR consisting of three mainparts as follows:- Bilingual terminology acquisition frombi-directional comparable corpora, completedthrough a two-stages term-by-term translationmodel.- Linguistic-based pruning, which is applied onthe extracted translation alternatives in order to filterand detect terms and their translations that are mor-phologically close enough, i.e., with close or similarpart-of-speech tags.- Phrasal translation, completed on the sourcequery after re-scoring the translation alternatives re-lated to each source query term.
The proposed re-scoring techniques are based on the World WideWeb (WWW), a large-scale test collection such asNTCIR, the comparable corpora or a possible inter-action with the user, among others.Finally, a linear combination to bilingual dictio-naries, bilingual thesauri and transliteration for thespecial phonetic alphabet of foreign words and loan-words, would be possible depending on the cost andavailability of linguistic resources.2.1 Two-stages Comparable Corpora-basedApproachThe proposed two-stages approach on bilingual ter-minology acquisition and disambiguation from com-parable corpora (Sadat et al, 2003) is described asfollows:- Bilingual terminology acquisition from sourcelanguage to target language to yield a first translationmodel, represented by similarity vectors SIMS?T .- Bilingual terminology acquisition from targetlanguage to source language to yield a secondtranslation model, represented by similarity vectorsSIMT?S .- Merge the first and second models to yield a two-stages translation model, based on bi-directionalcomparable corpora and represented by similarityvectors SIM(S?T .We follow strategies of previous researches (De-jean et al, 2002; Fung, 2000; Rapp, 1999) for thefirst and second models and propose a merging anddisambiguation process for the two-stages transla-tion model.
Therefore, context vectors of each termin source and target languages are constructed fol-lowing a statistics-based metric.
Next, context vec-tors related to source words are translated using apreliminary bilingual seed lexicon.
Similarity vec-tors SIMS?T and SIMT?S related to the first andsecond models respectively, are constructed for eachpair of source term and target translation using thecosine metric.The merging process will keep common pairs ofsource term and target translation (s,t) which appearin SIMS?T as (s,t) but also in SIMT?S as (t,s),to result in combined similarity vectors SIMS?Tfor each pair (s,t).The product of similarity values invectors SIMS?T and SIM(T?S will yield similar-ity values in SIMS?T for each pair (s,t) of sourceterm and target translation.2.2 Linguistics-based PruningMorphological knowledge such as Part-of-Speech(POS), context of terms extracted from thesauricould be valuable to filter and prune the extractedtranslation candidates.
POS tags are assigned toeach source term (Japanese) via morphological anal-ysis.Bilingual SeedLexiconLinguistic-based Pruning(Filtering based on Morphological knowledge of sourceterms and translation alternatives)Phrasal Translation(Re-scoring the translation alternatives)Bilingual TerminologyExtractionJapanese ?

We restricted the pruning technique to nouns,verbs, adjectives and adverbs, although other POStags could be treated in a similar way.
For Japanese-English pair of languages, Japanese nouns and verbsare compared to English nouns and verbs, respec-tively.
Japanese adverbs and adjectives are com-pared to English adverbs and adjectives, because ofthe close relationship between adverbs and adjec-tives in Japanese (Sadat et al, 2003).Finally, the generated translation alternatives aresorted in decreasing order by similarity values andrank counts are assigned in increasing order.
A fixednumber of top-ranked translation alternatives are se-lected and misleading candidates are discarded.2.3 Phrasal TranslationQuery translation ambiguity can be drastically mit-igated by considering the query as a phrase and re-stricting the single term translation to those candi-dates that were selected by the proposed combinedstatistics-based and linguistics-based approach (Sa-dat et al, 2003).
Therefore, after generating aranked list of translation candidates for each sourceterm, re-scoring techniques are proposed to estimatethe coherence of the translated query and decide thebest phrasal translation.Assume a source query Q having n terms {s1.
.
.sn}.
Phrasal translation of the source query Qis completed according to the selected top-rankedtranslation alternatives for each source term si anda re-scoring factor RFk, as follows:Qphras =?k=1..thres[Qk(s1..sn)?RFk(t1..tn; s1..sn)]Where, Qk(s1..sn) represents the phrasal translationcandidate associated to rank k. The re-scoring factorRFk(t1..tn; s1..sn) is estimated using one of the re-scoring techniques, described below.Re-scoring through the WWWThe WWW can be considered as an exemplar lin-guistic resource for decision-making (Grefenstette,1999).
In the present study, the WWW is exploitedin order to re-score the set of translation candidatesrelated to the source terms.Sequences of all possible combinations are con-structed between elements of sets of highly rankedtranslation alternatives.
Each sequence is sent to apopular Web portal (here, Google) to discover howoften the combination of translation alternatives ap-pears.
Number of retrieved WWW pages in whichthe translated sequence occurred is used to representthe re-scoring factor RF for each sequence of trans-lation candidates.
Phrasal translation candidates aresorted in decreasing order by re-scoring factors RF .Finally, a number (thres) of highly ranked phrasaltranslation sequences is selected and collated intothe final phrasal translation.Re-scoring through a Test CollectionLarge-scale test collections could be used to re-score the translation alternatives and complete aphrasal translation.
We follow the same steps as theWWW-based technique, replacing the WWW by atest collection and a retrieval system to index docu-ments of the test collection.NTCIR test collection (Kando, 2001) could be a agood alternative for Japanese-English language pair,especially if involving the comparable corpora.Re-scoring through the Comparable CorporaComparable corpora could be considered for thedisambiguation of translation alternatives and thusselection of best phrasal translations (Sadat et al,2002).
Our proposed algorithm to estimate the re-scoring factor RF , relies on the source and tar-get language parts of the comparable corpora us-ing statistics-based measures.
Co-occurrence ten-dencies are estimated for each pair of source termsusing the source language text and each pair of trans-lation alternatives using the target language text.Re-scoring through an Interactive ModeAn interactive mode (Ogden and Davis, 2000)could help solve the problem of phrasal translation.The interactive environment setting should optimizethe phrasal translation, select best phrasal transla-tion alternatives and facilitate the information accessacross languages.
For instance, the user can access alist of all possible phrases ranked in a form of hier-archy on the basis of word ranks associated to eachtranslation alternative.
Selection of a phrase willmodify the ranked list of phrases and will providean access to documents related to the phrase.3 Experiments and Evaluations in CLIRExperiments have been carried out to measure theimprovement of our proposal on bilingual Japanese-English tasks in CLIR, i.e.
Japanese queries to re-trieve English documents.
Collections of news ar-ticles from Mainichi Newspapers (1998-1999) forJapanese and Mainichi Daily News (1998-1999) forEnglish were considered as comparable corpora.
Wehave also considered documents of NTCIR-2 testcollection as comparable corpora in order to copewith special features of the test collection duringevaluations.
NTCIR-2 (Kando, 2001) test collec-tion was used to evaluate the proposed strategies inCLIR.
SMART information retrieval system (Salton,1971), which is based on vector space model, wasused to retrieve English documents.Thus, Content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives,adverbs) were extracted from English and Japanesetexts.
Morphological analyzers, ChaSen version2.2.9 (Matsumoto and al., 1997) for texts inJapanese and OAK2 (Sekine, 2001) for texts in En-glish were used in linguistic pre-processing.
EDR(EDR, 1996) was used to translate context vectorsof source and target languages.First experiments were conducted on the severalcombinations of weighting parameters and schemesof SMART retrieval system for documents terms andquery terms.
The best performance was realized byATN.NTC combined weighting scheme.The proposed two-stages model using comparablecorpora showed a better improvement in terms of av-erage precision compared to the simple model (one-stage comparable corpora-based translation) with+27.1% and a difference of -32.87% in terms of av-erage precision of the monolingual retrieval.
Com-bination to linguistics-based pruning showed a bet-ter performance in terms of average precision with+41.7% and +11.5% compared to the simple compa-rable corpora-based model and the two-stages com-parable corpora-based model, respectively.Applying re-scoring techniques to phrasal transla-tion yields significantly better results with 10.35%,8.27% and 3.08% for the WWW-based, the NTCIR-based and comparable corpora-based techniques, re-spectively compared to the hybrid two-stages com-parable corpora and linguistics-based pruning.The proposed approach based on bi-directionalcomparable corpora largely affected the translationbecause related words could be added as translationalternatives or expansion terms.
Effects of extractingbilingual terminology from bi-directional compara-ble corpora, pruning using linguistics-based knowl-edge and re-scoring using different phrasal trans-lation techniques were positive on query transla-tion/expansion and thus document retrieval.4 ConclusionWe investigated the approach of extracting bilin-gual terminology from comparable corpora in or-der to enrich existing bilingual lexicons and en-hance CLIR.
We proposed a two-stages translationmodel involving extraction and disambiguation ofthe translation alternatives.
Linguistics-based prun-ing was highly effective in CLIR.
Most of the se-lected terms can be considered as translation can-didates or expansion terms.
Exploiting differentphrasal translation techniques revealed to be effec-tive in CLIR.
Although we conducted experimentsand evaluations on Japanese-English language pair,the proposed translation model is common acrossdifferent languages.Ongoing research is focused on the integration ofother linguistics-based techniques and combinationto transliteration for katakana, the special phoneticalphabet to Japanese language.ReferencesH.
