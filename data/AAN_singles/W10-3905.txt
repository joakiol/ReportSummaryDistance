Proceedings of the Second Workshop on NLP Challenges in the Information Explosion Era (NLPIX 2010), page 31,Beijing, August 2010Statistical Relational Learning for Knowledge Extraction from the WebHoifung PoonUniversity of Washington, USAAbstractExtracting knowledge from unstructured text has been a long-standing goal of NLP.
The adventof the Web further increases its urgency by making available billions of online documents.
Torepresent the acquired knowledge that is complex and heterogeneous, we need first-order logic.To handle the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity in extracting and reasoning with knowledge,we need probability.
Combining the two has led to rapid progress in the emerging field ofstatistical relational learning.
In this talk, I will show that statistical relational learning of-fers promising solutions for conquering the knowledge-extraction quest.
I will present Markovlogic, which is the leading unifying framework for representing and reasoning with complexand uncertain knowledge, and has spawned a number of successful applications for knowledgeextraction from the Web.
In particular, I will present OntoUSP, an end-to-end knowledge ex-traction system that can read text and answer questions.
OntoUSP is completely unsupervisedand benefits from jointly conducting ontology induction, population, and knowledge extraction.Experiments show that OntoUSP extracted five times as many correct answers compared tostate-of-the-art systems, with a precision of 91%.31
