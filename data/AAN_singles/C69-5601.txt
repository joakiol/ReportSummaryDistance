0.0 Phonolo$ical typologies~ statistical counts and mathematical modelsThe high structuring of phonology, the obvious classes ofsounds, and the classes of their classes, have made phonologicaltypologies a not too rare proposal.
And even where typologies werenot claimed as such, they were often implicit in the statements made.Both phonetic and phonemic, acoustic and articulatory, structural andnon-structural, have all been proposed and have evoked discussions,critiques and applications.One can mention works by the Prague linguists culminatingin the writings of, among others, Skali~ka, Kramsky, and no=ablyTrubetzkoy and Jakobson.
In America, we have work by Greenberg,Hockett, Saporta and Voegelin as well as numerous followers andcritics.
Among other European contributions the acoustic typologiesby Menzerath and Meyer-Eppler.0.i Mathematical models and mathematlcal (more precisely sta-tistical) techniques of analysis have also been elaborated.
Classi-fication, distribution and frequency characteristics of various soundpatterns have been a particular concern and represent the bulk ofnumerical phonological typologies, especially in the U.S, I Often,again, the subject is classification of inventories and particulartypes (articulatory) of phonemeS.
Such is, for instance, Pierce~s"A Statistical Study of New World Consonants", with counts of from themost to the least eo~on consonants and classes of consonants ina great number of Amerindian languager,, A critique end evaluationis found in Saporta 1957.
We have probably the least structuralend of the typological spectrum here.1.6 .... :~i c=_v,: fcauure typolo$iesThere is another series of phonological typologies basedon Jakobson's distinctive feature analysis and of course theirPraguian and particularly their Trubetzkoyan background.
22.0 The distinctive feature indices of Andre j AvramTypological indices derived from Jakobsonian featureswereproposed by Andrej Avram (1961).
to study the distribution ofdistinctive features in the phonological system.well):Avram proposes the following indices (if I understand himP = number of phonemesT = number of featuresD = number of features with which each feature combinesD m = average distribution of distinctive featuresR = coverage of each feature (how many phonemes itcharacterizes)Rm = coverage of the system as such (:R/T)C = complexity of a phoneme, i.e.
how many featuresit is a bundle ofC m - average complexity of the system (-EC/P)E = efficiency of a system; E-P/T2.1Avram also includes maxima and minima for Dm, Rm, Cm.His typology was a good first step for studying systemsvia their feature distribution.
However, there are cases, such asthe following two hypothetical systems, different (but of undecideddistance), which Avram's typology fails to distinguish.

Such a loss  of information is character-istic of averaging.3.0 Postovalova's valence and probabi l i ty indicesMore complicated yet much more adequate measures of dist inctivefeature distributions were proposed by the Soviet l inguist Postovalova.Although they were first used for the study of Just one systems typologicalappl ications were also suggested by the author.Postovalova's paper in Problemy Lingulsti~eskogo Anal izaexamines the subject of feature distr ibution in a phonological system.Severa~ statistics are defined:3.13.2simple probability, i.e.
frequency of utilization of afeature by the system for phoneme composition; the threepossibilities, +, --, 0 are considered separately.For feature a we have:i !
where m = number of rows withmPa = ~ n = number of rows.conditional probabilities, indicating how frequentlydifferent pairs of features characterize phonemes in thesystem, which is to say, given feature a for a phonemewhat are the chances that feature b will combine with ain the same phoneme.Given feature ~ the probability that ~ will combine withit for th~ same phoneme is:i ?i Pa(b) =where m' - number of phonemes with a and bn' - number of phonemes with ~.3.3 Finally, Valence is defined by Postovalova to discloseinformation on a feature's combinability with the o~herfeatures and also information on the system as a whole(by including total number of features).I Va(b) = Pa(b-----~) i where n = t?tal number ?f d i s t i n c t i V n  -  1features in the system.
(The probability of a feature appearing combined with anotherfeature would ben~ 1 if all features were equiprobable.
)3.4 lllustracion from the hypothetical case of 2.1 (The Valence proposedby Postovalova is modified hy Afendras (1968), so that it appears asfoature by feature matrix: this step is very important as it makescomparison across languages a matter of comparison of features drawnfrom the "Universal" system, rather than comparison between vowelsand their features.

Non-phonolog-Ica!
aspects have been thoroughly investigated, in the classic treat-~ent by Sandfeld (1930) and most recently in some powerful typological4.14.2studies (Kazazis, Civ'jan, Birnbaum in several articles, Klagstadt,etc.)
Balkan phonology has prompted many comments by Jakobson, Ividand others, but to my knowledge only one systematic study (Havr~nek,1933) which actually drew heavy criticism (Ma~ecki Stankiewicz).Interesting results were obtained by aPPlying the above method to the4 study of several Balkan idioms.But before discussing the results some of the basic problemsencountered will be mentioned:The  systems were compared against a maximal matrix whichincluded all the features occurring in the population of the systemsanalyzed.
5Any of the actual systems include a subset of this maximalset of features.
In the final correlation each system was consideredas having O's throughout for the features which it did not utilize.But 0Ws were also indicative of impertinence of a feature for a givenphoneme when the feature was distinctive for other phonemes in thesystem.
Thus two kinds of concepts were collapsed as they both wererepresented by 0.
However, this has probably been rectified by thefact that features not used in a system have a 0 throughout,Another actual handicap is the non-availability of distinctivefeature descriptions for the vast majority of the systems compared.And even when available, they were often tinted by both the author'sviews and his preferences (e.g.
Petrovici on Rumanian) or were out ofdifferent periods of theoretical development of distinctive features.84.3in such cases, I took the liberty of normalizing the data by modifyingthe existing analyses (:the same method was followed throughout e.g.constructing branching-trees).
In some other instances more than onesolution were possible and for lack of data I kept the alternatives.Such systems appear in the figures as language X-l, 2, 3 etc.
Otherinstances of numbered, multiple systems for one language refer tosituations where such variety actually exists either stylistically orin social dialects (e.g.
literary Makedonskl).Some features are very typical of vocalic systems eitheruniversally, or for the European languages, or, more specifically, forthe Balkan languages.
E.G.
diffuseness, ~ ,  flatness, stress(simDle occurrence is considered here, no____tttcombinations).
Then, otherfeatures s.a. length, ton_.___~e, ~ e t c .
are much less common.
Anideal comparison should give different weights to such features.Sharing nasality, for instance, should be typologically very significantand two systems which do, should be classed as very similar.
Converse-ly, if in a group of many languages which draw on 5-6 features to dis-tinguish their vowels, but usually have 3 or 4, only one uses nasalitythis should be significant enough to set this particular language quitefar apart.
Now, in the correlation some factors take this into accountbut indirectly and not sufficiently.
On the other hand since inIreality (i.e.
in the Balkan case) systems having "odd" features havealso the "common" features, their typological distance is reflectedin their having a higher number of features than the other languages,6a fact reflected in the Valence matrix (:lower values for each cell).4.4 The introduction of a new feature usually results in a wholeseries of new phonemes, and actual ly the more numerous these phonemesthe more important the new feature to the system.
This is expressedby the product of number of distinctive features X number of phonemes =total # of cells in the feature by phoneme matrix.
An index incorporat-ing this wi l l  reflect more qualit ies of the whole system.
I proposetherefor~tentat ive lysa modif icat ion of the valence formula to:V~(b) = Pa(b) where K - # of phonemes ?
(n -i)This we ight inEmakes  the index much more sensitive to varia-tions in the number of features.4.5 Higher order conditional probabil it ies can also be intro-duced, e.g.
1 \] Pab (c) = ~mwhere K = number of phonemes which have in commonfeatures a, b and ~, andm = number of phonemes with a and b in common.A Valence Vab(c) PaD(c) (n-l) can then be defined.And so on until  we have the PI .

7Gammon (1967) used a similar statistical technique forfinding the similarity (conversely, the distance) between severalPolynesian languages.
In his case, the information was not in theform of matrices but in the farm of lists.6.0 Resultsin the final plotting (see figures I, 2, 3 and 4) several groupingscan be discerned.First, in the multidimensionalsealin~ analysis, we canspeak roughly of 3 groups: two form a sort of a nucleus in the centerand the third (distributed in two subgroups also) surrounds it.On the external group we have Old Church Slavic, and close by CommonSlavic.

7-vowel Mom~ilovci Bulgarian,(9#Nasal) vowels BarileTosk Albanian, 8-vowel Meglenitie, 7-vowel E. Bosnia Serbo-croatian).This group seems to include only dialects with the feature of tenseness.Except for the Albanian dialect, all group members are dialects located~ ,~zq5.

we have here an areal grouping.Four out of six Albanian systems(all of the dialects within the geographic area of the Balkans) fallin one group and are  closer to Macedonian and Bulgarian than toRumanlan.Greek dialects are quite diffused but stay within the twonuclear groups (this includes Classical Attic and Medieval Greek.
)In the diz~eter method (figure 4), the most interestinggrouping is that of all seven systems with the 5-vowel pattern(irrespective of additional features such as length - nasality - tone)on the same side of the initial bifurcation.Another subgrouplng includes only systems which use flatnessto distinguish a second series of hack vowels (Rhodope Bulgarlan,Kra~ova I Serbo-croatian, Bulgarian Saraka~an Greekp and Hrupi~taArumenian).Among the other interesLing results are the following: con-trary to Old Church Slavic and Common Slavic, which in both analysesstand apart, Attic Greek is classed as very similar to the bulk of thesystems analyzed: in the diameter method throug h early Joining of thebranching tree, and in the multidimensional sealing by being locatedin the middle of the one of the two central constellations.

Revzin;Vthe work of other Soviet and East European linguists (Saum~an,Marcus, Kulagina etc.)
is very interesting and could beapplied to typological investigations.
For an overview seeKiefer, 1968.On statistical techniques, Pierce (1957, 1962), Saporta (1957),Spang-Hanssen, Herdan; in Eastern Europe extensive work, of whichone can mention Kr~msky who typifies some of the Prague researchand Andreyev's group in the Soviet Union.For general discussions, see Birnbaum 1966, 1968, 1969,Edmundson 1967, Greenberg 1957, Horne 1966, Ku~era and Monroe1968, Plath 1963, Spang-Hanssen 1961-1964, Uspenskij 1966.For a historieal-phonetih typology see Grimes 1961.Of course Jekobson's work as well as that of Trubetzkoy is of atypological nature.
Such is for instance Trubetzkoy's Gz~zugeder P;~nolo~e as well as his articles on vocalic or consonantalsystems.
For a discussion of the typological nature ofIJakobson, Fant and Halle's PPe~42ni~ies to Speech Analysis, seeVoegelin 1956.3)4)5)Notes (cont .
)It seems that no two "mirror" systems could be distinguishedby this typology.
A theoretical shortcoming in spite of thefact that not  terribly many such cases exist.Much of the data analysis used for the present paper was doneat the Johns Hopkins University, as part of my doctoralresearch which culminated in a thesis (May 1968).The idea of a maximal system thus defined can also be foundin Voegelin 1963.
Uspenskij (1965:63) defines it as follows,opposite to a minimal system: "Jazyk-~talon pervogo tipa(i.e.

Uspenskijpoints out that the minimal system in a sense "catches theessence" of the languages to be compared.

Pierce's, with its "omnipresent" consonants,the basic core : minlm~, and total collection of any conson-ants occurring in at least one language = maximum.See, for instance, in the statistical correlation (KRUSKALMultidimensional Scaling) OCS, Common Slavic stand quite apartfrom almost all of the other languages.7) See appendix for a list of all the idioms analyzed.8) Reproduced from Afendras (1968:145) fig.

"It is tempting to guessthat the scatter In Rumanian could reflect the influence ofnon Romance speech communities that have interacted with theRumanian community (or communities) '' .Now since in our analysis Rumanian is quite close to theother Balkan languages (unlike, for instance Serbocroatian)one could say that Grimes' study and this present complement-ary and mut~l ly  supportlng results.Edmundson's section on mathematical models In Borko 1967 prov-ides a s tar t ing  point with the must and must nots of theresearcher, the does and the does nots of the model.SUMMARYIn this study, the vocalic systems of a large number of Balkanidioms (past and present) were analyzed in terms of Jakobsoniandistinctive features.
Various methods for comparison and scalingfor similarity, as well as the problems encountered, are discussedand evaluated.
Some questions of typology, such as distinctivefeature weights, are revealed; suggestions are made for theirfuture incorporation into typologies of this nature.It is a srtrprJusing fact in l inguistic scholarship that nofeasible,  nor adequate manner  for compar ing phonological sys temsquantitat ively has been devised.
The notion of dist inct ive featureva lenceproposed  by the Russ ian l inguist, V. I.
