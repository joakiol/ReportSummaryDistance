COMPUTER-A IDED GRAMMATICAL  TAGGING OF  SPOKEN ENGL ISHJan Svartvik, University of LundDepar tment  of EnglishHelgonabacken 14S-ZZ3 6Z Lund, SwedenAbstractThe paper presents an outline of a system forg rammat ica l  tagging of the London-Lund Corpusof spoken English consisting of some 450 000words.
The material, all of which will beavailable on magnetic computer  tape, and partof which is now available in both machine-readable and printed form, has been transcrib-ed orthographically with prosodic mark ing  fortone units, nuclei, stresses, pauses, etc (seeSamples 1 and Z).
Whereas  there is now con-siderable agreement  on the usefulness of atagged corpus, there is as yet no consensus onthe best type of tagging, let alne the procedureinvolved.
The analysis proposed here is ofcourse specifically a imed at tagging spokenEnglish, but should be largely applicable alsoto written English.The syntactic tagging will initially be based onsurface properties, since we are interested ingaining information that is directly availablethrough the signals that hearers use for decod-ing a message,  ie their perceptual strategies.In this respect, the plan is no innovation.
Onecomputer  discourse mode l  which is intended"to tackle prob lems that a speaker evidentlytackles" has recently been reported by Davey(1978.4).
His model, however, is designed toproduce, not understand.
Another and moreimportant difference between the SSE systemand the Davey  mode l  and most  other computerdiscourse models  is that the latter have beendevised to handle restricted and artificialuniverses of discourse, such as describinggames  or mov ing  blocks.
However,  the workof Winograd (197Z), for example, is directlyrelevant to our task, since it deals with wideraspects of language and makes  impressive useof Halliday's systemic grammar  for producingparsing algorithms.One of our a ims is to make  the tagging proce-dure as automatic as possible.
Specifically,we would like to see how far it is possible tocarry out syntactic analysis based on graphicwords and prosody (provided by the material)and word  class tags (provided by a general-purpose dictionary).
Given that no fullyautomatic system for grammat ica l  taggingexists, we propose to imp lement  an interactive,semi -manua l  mode of analysis.The paper will present word  class tagging oftypes f rom the Longman Dictionary of Con-temporary  English, disambiguation of tokensand phrase tagging by means  of a set of parsingalgorithms.
The basic unit of analysis will bethe tone unit.
In a previous study of Surveymaterial of spoken English, it was found thatthe overall average length of a tone unit was5.3 words and that "there was considerablecorrelation between the length of tone units andtheir g rammat ica l  contents" with a "high degreeof co-extensiveness between tone units andgrammat ica l  units of group, phrase, andclause structure" (Quirk et al1964).The search for grammat ica l  phrases will bef rom right to left within the tone unit.
Sincethis search sequence is definitely unorthodox,some explanation may be called for.
By  andlarge, English phrase structure typically hasthe head to the right, as inVerb phrases: will be DOINGNoun phrases: the nice little DOGAdjective phrases: stunningly BEAUTIFULAssuming  that a good number  of the tone unitsconsist of, at least, g rammat ica l  phrases, thenucleus will occur within the phrase and, moreoften than not, within the head of the phrase.Thus, it is likely that it will be linguisticallyrewarding as well as computationally economi-cal to search f rom right to left.
It seems thata left-to-right search method  also runs intodifficulties with solving left-recursion struc-tures and predicting numerous  alternatives.The phrase recognition rules are to be appliedin the following order:(VPH) Verb phrases(APH)  Adverb  phrases(JPH) Adjective phrases(NPH)  Noun phrases(PPH) Prepositional phrases29--The typical features of this system are: takingtone units as the basis of grammat ica l  analysis,choosing a general-purpose dictionary for wordclass tagging, mak ing  extensive use of phrasestructure rules which are applied in a certainorder and cyclically, and partly adopting aninteractive mode of analysis.Sample i.
