We presenta pipeline approach integrating an er-ror detection model, a combination ofcharacter- and word-level translation mod-els, a reranking model and a punctuationinsertion model.
We achieve an F1scoreof 62.8% on the development set of theQALB corpus, and 58.6% on the officialtest set.1 IntroductionDevising algorithms for automatic error correctiongenerated considerable interest in the communitysince the early 1960s (Kukich, 1992) for at leasttwo reasons.
First, typical NLP tools lack in ro-bustness against errors in their input.
This sen-sitivity jeopardizes their usefulness especially forunedited text, which is prevalent on the web.
Sec-ond, automated spell and grammar checkers facil-itate text editing and can be of great help to non-native speakers of a language.
Several resourcesand shared tasks appeared recently, including theHOO task (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010) and theCoNLL task on grammatical error correction (Nget al., 2013b).
In this paper we describe our partic-ipation to the first shared task on automatic errorcorrection for Arabic (Mohit et al., 2014).While non-word errors are relatively easy tohandle, the task is more challenging for gram-matical and semantic errors.
Detecting and cor-recting such errors require context-sensitive ap-proaches in order to capture the dependencies be-tween the words of a text at various lexical and se-mantic levels.
All the more so for Arabic whichbrings dependence down to the morphologicallevel (Habash, 2010).A particularity interesting approach to error cor-rection relies on statistical machine translation(SMT) (Brockett et al., 2006), due to its context-sensitivity and data-driven aspect.
Therefore, thepipeline system which we describe in Section 2has as its core a phrase-based SMT component(PBSMT) (Section 2.3).
Nevertheless, several fac-tors may hinder the success of this approach, suchas data sparsity, discrepancies between transla-tion and error correction tasks, and the difficultyof incorporating context-sensitive features into theSMT decoder.We address all these issues in our system whichachieves a better correction quality than a simpleword-level PBSMT baseline on the QALB corpus(Zaghouani et al., 2014) as we show in our exper-iments in Section 3.2 Pipeline Approach to Error CorrectionThe PBSMT system accounts for context by learn-ing, from a parallel corpus of annotated errors,mappings from erroneous multi-word segments oftext to their corrections, and using a languagemodel to help select the suitable corrections incontext when multiple alternatives are present.Furthermore, since the SMT approach is data-driven, it is possible to address multiple types oferrors at once, as long as examples of them appearin the training corpus.
These errors may includenon-word errors, wrong lexical choices and gram-matical errors, and can also handle normalizationissues (Yvon, 2010).One major issue is data sparsity, since largeamount of labeled training data is necessary toprovide reliable statistics of all error types.
We ad-114dress this issue by backing-off the word-level PB-SMT model with a character-level correction com-ponent, for which richer statistics can be obtained.Another issue may stem from the inherent dif-ference in nature between error correction andtranslation.
Unlike translation, the input and out-put vocabularies in the correction task overlap sig-nificantly, and the majority of input words are typi-cally correct and are copied unmodified to the out-put.
The SMT system should handle correct wordsby selecting their identities from all possible op-tions, which may fail resulting in over-correction.To help the SMT decoder decide, we augment ourpipeline with a problem zone detection compo-nent, which supplies prior information on whichinput words need to be corrected.The final issue concerns the difficulty of incor-porating features that require context across phraseboundaries into the SMT decoder.
A straightfor-ward alternative is to use such features to rerankthe hypotheses in the SMT n-best hypotheses lists.Since punctuation is particularity noisy in Ara-bic data, we add a specialized punctuation inser-tion component to our pipeline, depicted in Figure1.2.1 Error DetectionWe formalize the error detection problem as asequence labeling problem (Habash and Roth,2011).
Errors are classified into substitution, in-sertion and deletion errors.
Substitutions involvean incorrect word form that should be replaced byanother correct form.
Insertions are words thatare incorrectly added into the text and should bedeleted.
Deletions are simply missing words thatshould be added.We group all error classes into a simple binaryproblem tag: a word from the input text is taggedas ?PROB?
if it is the result of an insertion ora substitution of a word.
Deleted words, whichcannot be tagged themselves, cause their adjacentwords to be marked as PROB instead.
In this way,the subsequent components in the pipeline can bealerted to the possibility of a missing word via itssurroundings.
Any words not marked as PROB aregiven an ?OK?
tag.Gold tags, necessary for training, can be gener-ated by comparing the text to its correction usingsome sequence alignment technique, for which weuse SCLITE (Fiscus, 1998).For this task, we use Yamcha (Kudo and Mat-sumoto, 2003) to train an SVM classifier usingmorphological and lexical features.
We employa quadratic polynomial kernel.
The static featurewindow context size is set to +/- 2 words; the pre-vious two (dynamic) predicted tags are also usedas features.The feature set includes the surface forms andtheir normalization after ?Alef?, ?Ya?
and digitnormalization, the POS tags and the lemmas of thewords.
These morphological features are obtainedusing MADA 3.0 (Habash et al., 2009).1We alsouse a set of word, POS and lemma 3-gram lan-guage models scores as features.
These LMs arebuilt using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002).The error detection component is integrated intothe pipeline by concatenating the predicted tagswith the words of the input text.
The SMT modeluses this additional information to learn distinctmappings conditional on the predicted correctnessof words.2.2 Character-level Back-off CorrectionEach word that is labeled as error (PROB) in theoutput of the error detection component is mappedto multiple possible corrections using a weightedfinite-state transducer similar to the transducersused in speech recognition (Mohri et al., 2002).The WFST, for which we used OpenFST (Al-lauzen et al., 2007), operates on the characterlevel, and the character mapping is many-to-many(similar to the phrase-based SMT framework).The score of each proposed correction is a com-bination of the scores of character mappings usedto build it.
The list is filtered using WFST scoresand an additional character-level LM score.
Theresult is a list of error-tagged words and their cor-rection suggestions, which constitutes a small on-the-fly phrase table used to back-off primary PB-SMT table.During training, the mapping dictionary islearned from the training after aligning it at thecharacter level using SCLITE.
Mapping weightsare computed as their normalized frequencies inthe aligned training corpus.2.3 Word-level PBSMT CorrectionWe formalize the correction process as a phrase-based statistical machine translation problem(Koehn et al., 2003), at the word-level, and solve1We did not use MADAMIRA (the newest version ofMADA) since it was not available when this component wasbuilt.115Character-levelCorrectionErrorDetectionWord-levelPBSMT CorrectionN-bestRerankingPunctuationInsertion,?

The reranking component selects the best hypothesis, and pass it to the punctuation insertioncomponent in order to produce the final output.it using Moses, a well-known PBSMT tool (Koehnet al., 2007).
The decoder constructs a correctionhypothesis by first segmenting the input text intophrases, and mapping each phrase into its best cor-rection using a combination of scores including acontext-sensitive LM score.Unlike translation, error correction is mainlymonotonic, therefore we set disallow reorderingby setting the distortion limit in Moses to 0.2When no mapping can be found for a givenphrase in the primary phrase table, the decoderlooks it up in the back-off model.
The decodersearches the space of all possible correction hy-potheses, resulting from alternative segmentationsand mappings, and returns the list of n-best scor-ing hypotheses.2.4 N-best List RerankingIn this step, we combine LM information with lin-guistically and semantically motivated features us-ing learning to rank methods (Tomeh et al., 2013).Discriminative reranking (Liu, 2009) allows eachhypothesis to be represented as an arbitrary set offeatures without the need to explicitly model theirinteractions.
Therefore, the system benefits fromglobal and potentially complex features which arenot available to the baseline decoder.Each hypothesis in an n-best list is representedby a d-dimensional feature vector.
Word error rate(WER) is computed for each hypotheses by com-paring it to the reference correction.
The resulting2Only 0.14% of edits in the QALB corpus are actuallyreordering.scored n-best list is used for supervised trainingof a reranking model.
We employ a pairwise ap-proach to ranking which takes pairs of hypothesesas instances in learning, and formalizes the rank-ing problem as pairwise classification.For this task we use RankSVM (Joachims,2002) which is a method based on Support Vec-tor Machines (SVMs).
We use only linear kernelsto keep complexity low.
We use a rich set of fea-tures including LM scores on surface forms, POStags and lemmas.
We also use a feature based on aglobal model of the semantic coherence of the hy-potheses (Tomeh et al., 2013).
The new top rankedhypothesis is the output of this step which is thenfed to the next component.2.5 Punctuation InsertionWe developed a model that predicts the occurrenceof periods and commas in a given Arabic text.The core model is a decision tree classifier trainedon the QALB parallel training data using WEKA(Hall et al., 2009).
For each space between twowords, the classifier decides whether or not to in-sert a punctuation mark, using a window size ofthree words surrounding the underlying space.The model uses the following features:?
A class punctuation feature, that is whether toinsert a period, a comma or none at the cur-rent space location;?
The part-of-speech of the previous word;?

proclitic that is either a conjunction, asub-conjunction or a connective particle.We obtain POS and proclitic information usingMADAMIRA (Pasha et al., 2014).
The output ofthis component is the final output of the system.3 ExperimentsAll the models we use in our pipeline are trainedin a supervised way using the training part of theQALB corpus (Zaghouani et al., 2014), while wereserve the development part of the corpus for test-ing.3.1 Error detectionWe evaluate the error detection binary classifier interms of standard classification measures as shownin Figure 2.
Each point on the curve is computedby selecting a threshold on the classifier score.The threshold we use correspond to recall equalto 80%, at which the precision is very low whichleaves much room for improvement in the perfor-mance of the error detection component.3.2 Character-level correctionWe evaluate the character-level correction modelby measuring the percentage of erroneous phrasesthat have been mapped to their in-context refer-ence corrections.
We found this percentage to be41% on QALB dev data.
We limit the size ofsuch phrases to one in order to focus on out-of-vocabulary words.3.3 Punctuation insertionTo evaluate the punctuation insertion indepen-dently from the pipeline, we first remove the pe-riods and commas from input text.
Consideringonly the locations where periods and commas ex-ist, our model gives a recall of 49% and a precisionof 53%, giving an F1-score of 51%.When we apply our punctuation model in thecorrection pipeline, we find that it is always betterto keep the already existing periods and commasin the input text instead of overwriting them bythe model prediction.While developing the model, we ran experi-ments where we train the complete list of fea-tures produced by MADAMIRA; that is part-of-speech, gender, number, person, aspect, voice,case, mood, state, proclitics and enclitics.
Thiswas done for two preceding words and two follow-ing words.
However, the results were significantlyoutperformed by our final set-up.3.4 The pipelineThe performance of the pipeline is evaluated interms of precision, recall and F1as computed bythe M2Scorer (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012b).
Theresults presented in Table 1 show that a simplePBSMT baseline achieves relatively good perfor-mance compared to more sophisticated models.The character-level back-off model helps by im-proving recall at the expense of decreased preci-sion.
The error detection component hurts the per-formance which could be explained by its intrin-sic bad performance.
Since more investigation isneeded to clarify on this point, we drop this com-ponent from our submission.
Both reranking andpunctuation insertion improve the performance.Our system submission to the shared task (back-off+PBSMT+Rank+PI) resulted in an F1score of58.6% on the official test set, with a precision of76.9% and a recall of 47.3%.4 Related WorkBoth rule-based and data-driven approaches toerror correction can be found in the literature(Sidorov et al., 2013; Berend et al., 2013; Yi etal., 2013) as well as hybridization of them (Putraand Szabo, 2013).
Unlike our approach, most of117System PR RC F1PBSMT 75.5 49.5 59.8backoff+PBSMT 74.1 51.8 60.9ED+backoff+PBSMT 61.3 45.4 52.2backoff+PBSMT+Rank 75.7 52.1 61.7backoff+PBSMT+Rank+PI 74.9 54.2 62.8Table 1: Pipeline precision, recall and F1scores.ED: error detection, PI: punctuation insertion.the proposed systems build distinct models to ad-dress individual types of errors (see the CoNLL-2013, 2014 proceedings (Ng et al., 2013a; Nget al., 2014), and combine them afterwords us-ing Integer Linear Programming for instance (Ro-zovskaya et al., 2013).
This approach is relativelytime-consuming when the number of error typesincreases.Interest in models that target all errors at oncehas increased, using either multi-class classifiers(Farra et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2013), of-the-shelfSMT techniques (Brockett et al., 2006; Mizu-moto et al., 2011; Yuan and Felice, 2013; Buysand van der Merwe, 2013; Buys and van derMerwe, 2013), or building specialized decoders(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012a).Our system addresses the weaknesses of theSMT approach using additional components in apipeline architecture.
Similar work on word-leveland character-level model combination has beendone in the context of translation between closelyrelated languages (Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012).A character-level correction model has also beenconsidered to reduce the out-of-vocabulary rate intranslation systems (Habash, 2008).5 Conclusion and Future WorkWe described a pipeline approach based onphrase-based SMT with n-best list reranking.
Weshowed that backing-off word-level model with acharacter-level model improves the performanceby ameliorating the recall of the system.The main focus of our future work will be onbetter integration of the error detection model, andon exploring alternative methods for combiningthe character and the word models.AcknowledgmentsThis material is partially based on research fundedby grant NPRP-4-1058-1-168 from the Qatar Na-tional Research Fund (a member of the QatarFoundation).
