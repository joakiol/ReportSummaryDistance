Ascontext processing is carried out on only a shallowlevel, only information for lexical item, nurnber, per-son, gender, case role etc is used in the context system,along with semantic inIi)rtnation from the semanticnetwork.
The way that this information is used willbe explained below in regard to the specific problemsthat tile use of context is intended to resolw~.4 The  Context  Mon i to rThe context monitor proposed in this pal)eruses a standard focussing theory as a basis(\[Sidner 81\]),\[Sid,ler 8(i\]), amlough sonrexvhat simpli-fied according to the bes* :press approach that we areadopting.
It is planned to increase the COml~lexily ofthis initial algorithm to reflect more current wn'sionsof the theory as the system is developed.The context monitor has a number of basic datastructures: Current l;k)cus, Actor l'~oeus, Potential ,'o-cus List, Potential Actor I;'ocus List, Discourse Seg-ment Stack and Actor I:ocus Stack.
There is also aCurrent State List that maintains a record of all thesemantic items currently hehl in any of the other datastructures and the semantic features to whMl theyare linked.
This list is updated (entries added :rodremoved) after every sentence.In ordc'r to lilnlt the scope of the context informa-tion required in the context monitor, an analysis wasmade of the main differences between 3apanese amlEnglish that provide problenas for MT syst.ems.
Thebasis of the analysis was to find what information canbe gained from context to solve these problems.4 .1  P lu ra l  FomnsJapanese is (in general a) mmlarkc'd for mlmber.
I';n-glish, however, differentiates between singular andplural, q'his fact causes problems when translatingt?om Japanese to English as the mlmber informationrequired for the inflection and declension of English isnot available from the analysis of the 3apanese.

'\]_'hus, in the example text.
in Section 1, after theinitial sentence is analysed, the proposed focus is twonew TV models and fmtr new video models, the strut.-lure o\[" which is shown in Figure 3 below: 4\[sell : \[set2:\[pred :terebi (T V),lllllll~l)\[lll' ~nlod:\[p red:l.:ishu (model),spee:\[pred:,li (Iwo),_.\]1\],ref:set2\],\[set3:\[pred:l)ideo(video),l l l l l l l ;ph l r  1mod:\[pred:kishu(model),SlmC :\[pred : yo,,(fiJwl 9,-.\]\]\],rcf:set3\],,'of:set 1\]l:igure 3: PIi.Of, OG StructureSentence 2 (S?)
is analysed and a test is made tosee if any items in that sentence confirm or reject theproposed focus.
'l'he structure for the item g'7"~("a video/videos") is matched by mfiIication with thestructure for the prol)osed focus and can Im matchedwith a subset of it., namely ~)i k. v,/2"-)~  - IJtl,~K~{\[( ("dnew video models").
That  item is there.fore taken Ioconllrm the proposed R)t:us.That  proposed I'oeus is, however, hnmedhttelyPUSlled onto the focus stack because the subset of 4vhleos is taken as the current \['ocus 5.
'Phe item 13-)~";tof $2 inherits the feal.tlrcs of the set.

This provides a powerflil augnlentationto the basic nctwork.4 ,4  The  Augmented  Semant ic  Net -workTile semantic network in this system is basically a hi-erarchy of Objects, States and Events.
The additionof features to the semantic network in effect adds linksto the network.
Two kinds of link are proposed: per-manent links and temporary links.
Permanent' linksare conditions that must be true for a certain actionor state-of-affairs to bold.
The other, temporary, linksare used to create a default state for the objects men-tioned in the text.
As the text is processed, these linksmay change, so that the information awtilable to thesystem will differ from one sentence to the next.4.4.1 The  L inksThe division between Objects, States and Events is re-flected in tlle type of feature given to semantic itclnS.For exainple, Events typically coilgain features aboutthe sort of things that are affected by that event;States contain information the types of objects thatmay be in that state; Objects contain i i l forlnaiiouabout any subparts or if they themselves are typi-cally part of another (larger) object and wliat type ofEvent they are typically involved in.On this basis, the following types of link are pro-posed:.
Condition (=c): (permanent) a condition that must|lold for a State or Event to come about., Before Condition (BC::): (pernianeut) a conditionthat must be trlie before an Event or State coniesabout.
* After Condition (AC::): (permanent) a co,lditionthat becomes trtie after an Event or State comesabout.
* Has Subpart (l,as): (tenlporary) an Object lias re--lated subparts or is a subpart of another Object.
* Characteristic (has Semautic.Label): (I.emliorary)an Object has the characteristic of Senmntie_Lal)el(usually an Abstract_Relation: Size, Shape Colouretc.).
This takes the form of: "lteni has Senlau-tie_Label", such as "Pelerhas Ex is te l ,ee  Li f~span".Tiffs states that an item witll tile semantic item Pe-ter has an existence of some kind and filrther locatestllat itenl on a path of the network to the abstractrelation of lAfespan.
Iu this way, nodes between thesetwo points are all available for reference by the infer-ence system.. Ability (able_to): (temporary) This is not fully de-fined in tim current systenl but represents character-istic features of items e.g.
"dooF' often appears in thetlleme position of tile Events Open aud ,O'hll\[.These liuks are considered sutllcient for tile currentcapabilities of the system.
I,inks may be deleted orothers added as the range of the sytem widens, if thisis tllought necessary or desirable.4.4.2 Permanent  .
(k Ten lporary  L inksThe dlfference between perrnal lent and I;enll)orarylinks is iu the nature of the iuformation that they con-vey.
Permauent links are those that are augmentedto tile l le twork  and COlllleCt uodes cue I,o ti le otherin accordance with the features found in those nodes.~Bef(~re Condition and Aries" Condition links are per-manent, although the hiformation contaiued in theuodes that, t.hey connect to will only become awdl-able to the context nlonitor iu accordance with thetense al/d aspect of the verb (i.e.. all After Condi-lion is obviously only valid crier the completion ofthe (for exalnplc) action denoted by a verb has fin-ished.

Thus the semantic item"John" is first linked with the semantic feature "l lu-man" and all the other featm'es inherited from thatfeature.
However, the features associated with thesemantic item "Die" cause the links associated with"John" to change.
This means that when tile see-end sentence is analysed, the possilfle candidates f()rthe exl)erieneer role of the semantic item "lhLSa(f'are analysed, an itmn with the semantic feature "All-inmte" will be sought, and so the item ",/ok."

It depends entirely on the links between odesof the network and there is an obvious limit as tohow complicated those links may I)eeome before theprocessing required to search all t,he nodes linked toa particular item becomes prohibitiw~'.
At, the current,stage of planning, a strnctnre (a semantic il.eni) maybe linked to another via one node (constrained l o bean Abstract It.elation).
There are no current plans I.oincrease the number of such linking nodes.The inference mechanism is also expected to per-form poorly where actions denoted by a wn'b are COlll-plex.
This is due to the very simple feature descrip-tions that we use in the systenl.
It might thereforebe desirable that,  if the processing is not ccmlpletedwithin, for example, a constrained time, the processbe terminated and the context moiiit,or left to rely onsemantic feature matching alone.Another major problem is writing the features forthe links in the network.
At the moment, all featuresare written by hand, })tit, it is hoped that sinlilar in-formation might be extracted from semantic and case-fi'ame dictionaries.The context monitor is currently written in PI I0-LOG 9.
