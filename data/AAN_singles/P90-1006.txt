MEMORY CAPACITY AND SENTENCE PROCESSINGEdward GibsonDepartment of Philosophy, Carnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890gibson@cs.cmu.eduABSTRACTThe limited capacity of working memory isintrinsic to human sentence processing, andtherefore must be addressed by any theoryof human sentence processing.
This papergives a theory of garden-path effects and pro-cessing overload that is based on simple as-sumptions about human short term memorycapacity.1 INTRODUCTIONThe limited capacity of working memory is intrinsicto human sentence processing, and therefore must beaddressed by any theory of human sentence process-ing.
I assume that the amount of short term memorythat is necessary at any stage in the parsing process isdetermined by the syntactic, semantic and pragmaticproperties of the structure(s) that have been built up tothat point in the parse.
A sentence becomes unaccept-able for processing reasons if the combination of theseproperties produces too great a load for the workingmemory capacity (cf.
Frazier 1985):(1)nE Aixi > Ki=1where:K is the maximum allowable processing load(in processing load units or PLUs),xl is the number of PLUs associated with prop-erty i,n is the number of properties,Ai is the number of times property i appears inthe structure in question.Furthermore, the assumptions described above pro-vide a simple mechanism for the explanation of com-mon psycholinguistic phenomena such as garden-patheffects and preferred readings for ambiguous sentences.Following Fodor (1983), I assume that the languageprocessor is an automatic device that uses a greedy al-gorithm: only the best of the set of all compatible r p-resentations for an input string are locally maintainedfrom word to word.
One way to make this idea explicitis to assume that restrictions on memory allow at mostone representation foran input string at any time (see,for example, Frazier and Fodor 1978; Frazier 1979;Marcus 1980; Berwick and Weinberg 1984; Pritchett1988).
This hypothesis, commonly called the serial39hypothesis, is easily compatible with the above viewof processing load calculation: given a choice betweentwo different representations forthe same input string,simply choose the representation that is associated withthe lower processing load.The serial hypothesis  just one way of placing localmemory restrictions on the parsing model, however.
Inthis paper I will present an alternative formulation oflocal memory restrictions within a parallel framework.There is a longstanding debate in the psycholinguis-tic literature as to whether or not more than one rep-resentation for an input can be maintained in parallel(see, for example, Kurtzman (1985) or Gorrell (1987)for a history of the debate).
It turns out that the par-aUel view appears to handle some kinds of data moredirectly than the serial view, keeping in mind that thedata are often controversial.
For example, it is difficultto explain in a serial model why relative processingload increases as ambiguous input is encountered (see,for example, Fodor et al 1968; Rayner et al 1983;GorreU 1987).
Data that is normally taken to be supportfor the serial hypothesis includes garden-path effectsand the existence of preferred readings of ambiguousinput.
However, as noted above, limiting the numberof allowable representations is only one way of con-straining parallelism so that these effects can also beaccounted for in a parallel framework.As a result of the plausibility of a parallel model, Ipropose to limit the difference in processing load thatmay be present between two structures for the same in-put, rather than limit the number of structures allowedin the processing of an input (cf.
Gibson 1987; Gibsonand Clark 1987; Clark and Gibson 1988).
Thus I as-sume that the human parser prefers one structure overanother when the processing load (in PLUs) associatedwith maintaining the first is markedly lower than theprocessing load associated with maintaining the sec-ond.
That is, I assume there exists some arithmeticpreference quantity P corresponding to a processingload, such that if the processing loads associated withtwo representations for the same string differ by load P,then only the representation associated with the smallerof the two loads is pursued.
1 Given the existence of alit is possible that he preference factor is a geometric onerather than an arithmetic one.
Given a geometric preferencefactor, one structure ispreferred over another when the ratioof their processing loads reaches athreshold value.
I exploreonly the arithmetic possibility in this paper; it is possiblethat the geometric alternative gives results that are as good,although I leave this issue for future research.preference factor P, it is easy to account for garden-patheffects and preferred readings of ambiguous sentences.Both effects occur because of a local ambiguity whichis resolved in favor of one reading.
In the case of agarden-path effect, the favored reading is not compati-ble with the whole sentence.
Given two representationsfor the same input string that differ in processing loadby at least the factor P, only the less computationallyexpensive structure will be pursued.
If that structureis not compatible with the rest of the sentence and thediscarded structure is part of a successful parse of thesentence, a garden-path effect results.
If the parse issuccessful, but the discarded structure is compatiblewith another reading for the sentence, then only a pre-ferred reading for the sentence has been calculated.Thus if we know where one reading of a (temporarily)ambiguous entence becomes the strongly preferredreading, we can write an inequality associated withthis preference:(2)n BZA,x,- Z ,x,i=1 i=1where:P is the preference factor (in PLUs),xi is the number of PLUs associated with prop-erty i,n is the number of properties,Ai is the number of times property i appears inthe unpreferred structure,Bz is the number of times property i appears inthe preferred structure.Given a parsing algorithm together with n proper-ties and their associated processing loads x~ ...xn, wemay write inequalities having the form of (1) and (2)corresponding to the processing load at various parsestates.
An algebraic technique called iinearprogram-ruing can then be used to solve this system of linearinequalities, giving an n-dimensional space for the val-ues ofxi as a solution, any point of which satisfies allthe inequalities.In this paper I will concentrate on syntacticproperties: 2 in particular, I present wo propertiesbased on the 0-Criterion of Government and BindingTheory (Chomsky 1981).
3 It will be shown that theseproperties, once associated with processing loads, pre-dict a large array of garden-path effects.
Furthermore,it is demonstrated that these properties also make de-2Note that I assume that there also exist semantic andpragmatic properties which are associated with significantprocessing loads, but which axe not discussed here.3In another syntactic theory, similar properties may be ob-tained from the principles that correspond to the 0-Criterionin that heory.
For example, the completeness and coherenceconditions of Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan 1982)would derive properties imilar to those derived from the0-Criterion.
The same empirical effects should result fromthese two sets of properties.sirable predictions with respect o unacceptability dueto memory capacity overload.The organization of this paper is given as follows:first, the structure of the underlying parser is described;second, the two syntactic properties are proposed;third, a number of locally ambiguous entences, in-cluding some garden-paths, are examined with respectto these properties and a solution space for the process-ing loads of the two properties i calculated; fourth, itis shown that his space seems to make the right predic-tions with respect o processing overload; conclusionsare given in the final section.2 THE UNDERLY ING PARSERThe parser to which the memory limitation constraintsapply must construct representations in such a wayso that incomplete input will be associated with somestructure.
Furthermore, the parsing algorithm must, inprinciple, allow more than one structure for an inputstring, so that the general constraints described in theprevious ection may apply to restrict he possibilities.The parsing model that I will assume is an extension ofthe model described in Clark and Gibson (1988).
Whena word is input, representations for each of its lexicalentries axe built and placed in the buffer, a one celldata structure that holds a set of tree structures.
Theparsing model contains a second data structure, thestack-set, which contains a set of stacks of buffer cells.The parser builds trees in parallel based on possibleattachments made between the buffer and the top ofeach stack in the stack-set.
The buffer and stack-setare formally defined in (3) and (4).
(3) A buffer cell is a set of structures { SI,... ,S, },where each Si represents he same segment of the inputstring.
The buffer contains one buffer cell.
(4) The stack-set isa set of stacks of buffer cells, whereeach stack represents the same segment of the inputstring:40{ ( { S1,1,1,S1,1,2, ...,Sl,l,nl,l },{ S1,2,1, S1,2,2,..., S1,2,nt,2 } ...
.
{ S1,.,,,1,S1,.,1,2 .... , $1,.,, .,,., } )i"{ s.,,,1,s.,1,2, ...,s.,,,..,, ).
{ s.,2,1, s.,2,2, ...,s.,2,.... } ....( .... } ) }where:p is the number of stacks;ml is the number of buffer cells in stack i;and nij is the number of tree structures in thejth buffer cell of stack i.The motivation for these data structures is givenby the desire for a completely unconstrained parsingalgorithm upon which constraints may be placed: thisalgorithm should allow all possible parser operationsto occur at each parse state.
There are exactly twoparser operations: attaching a node to another node andpushing a buffer cell onto a stack.
In order to allowboth of these operations to be performed in parallel,it is necessary to have the given data structures: thebuffer and the stack-set.
For example, consider a parserstate in which the buffer is non-empty and the stack-setcontains only a single cell stack:(5)Stack-set: { { { $1, ...,Sn } } }Buffer: { Bt, ...,Bin }Suppose that attachments are possible between thebuffer and the single stack cell.
The structures thatresult from these attachments will take up a single stackcell.
Let us call these resultant s ructures A1, Az, ...,Ak.If all possible operations are to take place at this parserstate, then the contents of the current buffer must alsobe pushed on top of the current stack.
Thus two stacks,both representing the same segment of the input stringwill result:(6)Stack 1: { { {at , .
.
.
,ak  } } }Stack 2: { { { B1, ...,Bin } { St, ...,S, } } }Since these two stacks break up the same segmentof the input string in different ways, the stack-set datastructure is necessary.3 TWO SYNTACTIC  PROPERTIESDERIVABLE FROM THE0 -CRITERIONFollowing early work in linguistic theory, I distin-guish two kinds of categories: functional categoriesand thematic or content categories (see, for example,Fukui and Speas (1986) and Abney (1987) and the ref-erences cited in each).
Thematic ategories includenouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions; functionalcategories include determiners, complementizers, andinflection markers.
There are a number of propertiesthat distinguish functional elements from thematic ele-ments, the most crucial being that functional elementsmark grammatical orrelational features while thematicelements pick out a class of objects or events.
I will as-sume as a working hypothesis that only those syntacticproperties that have to do with the thematic elements ofan utterance are relevant to preferences and overloadin processing.
One principle of syntax that is directlyinvolved with the thematic ontent of an utterance in aGovernment-Binding theory is the 0-Criterion:(7) Each argument bears one and only one 0-role (the-matic role) and each 0-role is assigned to one and onlyone argument (Chomsky 1981:36).I hypothesize that the human parser attempts to lo-caUy satisfy the 0-Criterion whenever possible.
Thusgiven a thematic role, the parser prefers to assign thatrole, and given a thematic element, he parser prefersto assign a role to that element.
These assumptions aremade explicit as the following properties:(8) The Property of Thematic Reception (PTR):Associate a load of XrR PLUs of short term memoryto each thematic element that is in a position that canreceive a thematic role in some co-existing structure,but whose 0-assigner isnot unambiguously identifiablein the structure in question.
(9) The Property of Thematic Assignment (PTA):Associate a load of XTA PLUs of short term memoryto each thematic role that is not assigned to a nodecontaining a thematic element.Note that the Properties of Thematic Assignmentand Reception are stated in terms of thematic elements.Thus the Property of Thematic Reception doesn't applyto functional categories, whether or not they are inpositions that receive thematic roles.
Similarly, if athematic role is assigned to a functional category, theProperty of Thematic Assignment does not notice untilthere is a thematic element inside this constituent.414 AMBIGUITY  AND THEPROPERTIES  OF  THEMATICASS IGNMENT AND RECEPT IONConsider sentence (10) with respect o the Propertiesof Thematic Assignment and Reception:(10) John expected Mary to like Fred.The verb expect is ambiguous: either it takes an NPcomplement asin the sentence John expected Mary orit takes an IP complement as in (10).
4 Consider thestate of the parse of (10) after the word Mary has beenprocessed:(11) a.
\[re Lvt, John \] \[v?
expected ~e Mary \]\]\]b.
\[tp \[~p John \] \[vp expected \[tp Lvp Mary \] \]\]\]In (1 la), the NP Mary is attached as the NP com-plement of expected.
In this representation there is noload associated with either of the Properties of The-matic Assignment or Reception since no thematic ele-ments need thematic roles and no thematic roles are leftunassigned.
In ( l lb), the NP Mary is the specifier ofa hypothesized IP node which is attached as the com-plement of the other reading of expected.
5 This rep-resentation is associated with at least xrR PLUs sincethe NP Mary is in a position that can be associatedwith a thematic role, the subject position, but whose0-assigner is not yet identifiable.
No load is associatedwith the Property of Thematic Assignment, however,since both thematic roles of the verb expected are as-signed to nodes that contain thematic elements.
Since4Following current notation in GB Theory, IP (InflectionPhrase) = S and CP (Complementizer Phrase) = S' (Chomsky1986).51 assume some form of hypothesis-driven node projec-tion so that noun phrases are projected to those categories thatthey may specify.
Motivation for this kind of projection algo-rithm is given by the processing of Dutch (Frazier 1987) andthe processing of certain English noun phrase constructions(Gibson 1989).there is no difficulty in processing sentence (10), theload difference between these two structures cannot begreater than P PLUs, the preference factor in inequality(2).
Thus the inequality in (12) is obtained:(12) xrR < PSince the load difference between the two struc-tures is not sufficient to cause a strong preference, bothstructures are maintained.
Note that this is an im-portant difference between the theories presented hereand the theory presented in Frazier and Fodor (1978),Frazier (1979) and Pritchett (1988).
In each of thesetheories, only one representation can be maintained,so that either ( l la)  or ( l lb)  would be preferred.
Inorder to account for the lack of difficulty in parsing(10), Frazier and Pritchett both assume that reanalysisin certain situations is not expensive.
No such stipu-lation is necessary in the framework given here: it issimply assumed that all reanalysis i expensive.
6Consider now sentence (13) with respect to the Prop-erties of Thematic Assignment and Reception:(13) John expected her mother to like Fred.Consider the state of the parse of (13) after the wordher has been processed.
In one representation the NPher will be attached as the NP complement ofexpected:(14) \[tp \[up John \] \[vp expected Lvv her \]\]\]In this representation there is no load associated witheither of the Properties of Thematic Assignment or Re-ception since no thematic objects need thematic rolesand no thematic roles are left unassigned.
In anotherrepresentation the NP her is the specifier of a hypoth-esized NP which is pushed onto a substack containingthe other eading of the verb expected:(15){ { \[tp \[ueJohn\] [vpexpected \[tp e\]\]\] }{ \[~p ~p her \] \] } }This representation is associated with at least xraPLUs since the verb expected has a thematic role to as-sign.
However, no load is associated with the genitiveNP specifier her since its a-assigner, although not yetpresent, is unambiguously identified as the head of theNP to follow (Chomsky (1986a)).
7 Thus the total oadassociated with (15) is xra PLUs.
Since there is no dif-ficulty in processing sentence (10), the load difference6See Section 4.1 for a brief comparison between the modelproposed here and serial models uch as those proposed byFrazier and Fodor (1978) and Pritchett (1988).7Note that specifiers do not always receive their thematicroles from the categories which they specify.
For example,a non-genitive noun phrase may specify any major category.In particular, itmay specify an IP or a CP.
But the specifier ofthese categories may receive its thematic role through chainformation from a distant 0-assigner, as in (16):(16) John appears to like beans.Note that here is no NP that corresponds to(16) (Chomsky(1970)):(17) * John's appearance to like beans.42between these two structures cannot be greater than PPLUs.
Thus the second inequality, (18), is obtained:(18) xra < PNow consider (19): s(19) # I put the candy on the table in my mouth.This sentence becomes ambiguous when the prepo-sition on is read.
This preposition may attach as anargument of the verbput or as a modifier of the NP thecandy:(20) a. I \[vv Iv, Iv put \] Lvv the candy \] \[ee on \] \]\]b. I \[vv Iv, Iv put \] Lvv the candy \[ep on \] \] \]\]At this point the argument attachment is stronglypreferred.
However, this attachment turns out to beincompatible with the rest of the sentence.
When theword mouth is encountered, no pragmatically coherentstructure can be built, since tables are not normallyfound in mouths.
Thus a garden-path effect results.Consider the parse state depicted in (20) with respect tothe Properties of Thematic Assignment and Reception.The load associated with the structure resulting fromargument attachment is XrA PLUs since, although the a-grid belonging to the verbput is filled, the thematic roleassigned by the preposition on remains unassigned.
Onthe other hand, the load associated with the modifierattachment is 2 *XrA +xrR PLUs since 1) both the verbput and the preposition on have thematic roles that needto be assigned and 2) the PP headed by on receivesa thematic role in the argument attachment s ructure,while it receives no such role in the structure underconsideration.
Thus the difference between the loadsassociated with the two structures i  XrA + XrR PLUs.Since the argument attachment structure is stronglypreferred over the other structure, I hypothesize thatthis load is greater than P PLUs:(21) Xra + XTR > PNow consider the the well-known garden-path sen-tence in (22):(22) # The horse raced past the barn fell.The structure for the input the horse raced is am-biguous between at least the two structures in (23):(23) a. be bvp the horse \] \[vp raced \]\]b. bp Lvp the Lv, Lv, horse/\] \[cp Oi raced \] \]\] \]Structure (23a) has no load associated with it dueto either the PTA or the PTR.
Crucially note that theverb raced has an intransitive reading so that no loadis required via the Property of Thematic Assignment.On the other hand, structure (23b) requires a load of2 ?
xrR PLUs since 1) the noun phrase the horse is in aposition that can receive a thematic role, but currentlydoes not and 2) the operator Oi is in a position thatmay be associated with a thematic role, but is not yetsI will prefix sentences that are difficult to parse becauseof memory limitations with the symbol "#".
Hence sen-tences that are unacceptable due to processing overload willbe prefixed with "#", as will be garden-path sentences.associated with one.
9 Thus the difference betweenthe processing loads of structures (23a) and (23b) is2 ?
xrR PLUs.
Since this sentence is a strong garden-path sentence, it is hypothesized that a load differenceof 2 ?
xrR PLUs is greater than the allowable limit, PPLUs:(24) 2 ?
xrR > PA surprising effect occurs when a verb which op-tionally subcategorizes for a direct object, like race, isreplaced by a verb which obligatorily subcategorizesfor a direct object, likefind:(25) The bird found in the room was dead.Although the structures and local ambiguities in (25)and (22) are similar, (22) causes a garden-path effectwhile, surprisingly, (25) does not.
To determine why(25) is not a garden-path sentence we need to examinethe local ambiguity when the word found is read:(26) a. be Me the bird \] Ire Iv, Iv found \] \[He \] \]\]\]b.
\[m Lvt, the ~, ~, bird/\] \[c/, Oi found \] \]\] \]The crucial difference between the verb found andthe verb raced is that found requires a direct object,while raced does not.
Since the 0-grid of the verbfound is not filled in structure (26a), this representationis associated with xrA PLUs of memory load.
Likestructure (23b), structure (26b) requires 2 ?
xrR PLUs.Thus the difference between the processing loads ofstructures (26a) and (26b) is 2 *xrR - XTA PLUs.
Sinceno garden-path effect results in (25), I hypothesize thatthis load is less than or equal to P PLUs:(27) 2 * xrR - XTA <_ PFurthermore, these results correctly predict hat sen-tence (28) is not a garden-path sentence ither:(28) The bird found in the room enough debris to builda nest.Hence we have the following system of inequalities:(29) a. xrR < Pb.
XTA < PC.
XTA "4-XTR > Pd.
2*XTR > Pe.
2 * XTR -- XrA < PThis system of inequalities is consistent.
Thus itidentifies a particular solution space.
This solutionspace is depicted by the shaded region in Figure 1.Note that, pretheoretically, there is no reason forthis system of inequalities to be consistent.
It couldhave been that the parser state of one of the examplesentences forced an inequality that contradicted somepreviously obtained inequality.
This situation wouldhave had one of three implications: theproperties beingconsidered might be incorrect; the properties beingconsidered might be incomplete; or the whole approach9In fact, this operator will be associated with a thematicrole as soon as a gap-positing algorithm links it with theobject of the passive participle raced.
However, when theattachment is initially made, no such link yet exists: theoperator will initially be unassociated with a thematic role.Xr l\zXrA ~-P / " ~  -xz~-~ P,e. '

Since this situation has not yet beenobserved, the results mutually support one another.4.1 A COMPARISON WITH SERIAL MODELSBecause serial models of parsing can maintain at mostone representation for any input string, they have dif-ficulty explaining the lack of garden-path effects insentences like (10) and (25):(10) John expected Mary to like Fred.
(25) The bird found in the room was dead.As a result of this difficulty Pritchett (1988) proposesthe Theta Reanalysis Constraint:l?
(30) Theta Reanalysis Constraint (TRC): Syntactic re-analysis which interprets a 0-marked constituent asoutside its current 0-Domain and as within an exist-ing 0-Domain of which it is not a member is costly.
(31) 0-Domain: c~ is in the 7 0-Domain of/3 iff c~receives the 7 0-role from/3 or a is dominated by aconstituent that receives the 3' 0-role from/3.As a result of the Theta Reanalysis Constraint, thenecessary reanalysis in each of (10) and (25) is notexpensive, so that no garden-path effect is predicted.Furthermore, the reanalysis in sentences like (22) and(19) violates the TRC, so that the garden-path effectsare predicted.However, there are a number of empirical problemswith Pritchett's theory.
First of all, it turns out that thel?Frazier and Rayner (1982) make a similar stipulation toaccount for problems with the theory of Frazier and Fodor(1978).
However, their account fails to explain the lackof garden-path effect in (25).
See Pritcheu (1988) for adescription of further problems with their analysis.Theta Reanalysis Constraint as defined in (30) incor-rectly predicts that the sentences in (32) do not inducegarden-path effects:(32) a.
# The horse raced past the barn was failing.b.
# The dog walked to the park seemed small.c.
# The boat floated own the river was a canoe.For example, consider (32a).
When the auxiliaryverb was is encountered, reanalysis is forced.
How-ever, the auxiliary verb was does not have a thematicrole to assign to its subject, the dog, so the TRC is notviolated.
Thus Pritchett's theory incorrectly predictsthat these sentences do not cause garden-path effects.Other kinds of local ambiguity that do not give thehuman parser difficulty also pose a challenge to serialparsers.
Marcus (1980) gives the sentences in (33) asevidence that any deterministic parser must be able tolook ahead in the input string: 11(33) a.
Have the boys taken the exam today?b.
Have the boys take the exam today.Any serial parser must be able to account for thelack of difficulty with either of the sentences in (33).It turns out that the Theta Reanalysis Constraint doesnot help in cases like these: no matter which analysisis pursued first, reanalysis will violate the TRC.4.2 EMPIRICAL SUPPORT: FURTHERGARDEN-PATH EFFECTSGiven the Properties of Thematic Assignment and Re-ception and their associated loads, we may now explainmany more garden-path effects.
Consider (34):(34) # The Russian women loved died.Up until the last word, this sentence is ambiguousbetween two readings: one where loved is the matrixverb; and the other where loved heads a relative clausemodifier of the noun Russian.
The strong preferencefor the matrix verb interpretation f the word lovedcan be easily explained if we examine the possiblestructures upon reading the word women:(35) a.
\[u, \[we the Russian women\]b.
\[u, \[We the IN, \[W, Russian/\] [cl, \[We Oi \] \[tP \[Wewomen \] \]\] \]\] \]Structure (35a) requires xrR PLUs since the NP theRussian women needs but currently lacks a thematicrole.
Structure (35b), on the other hand, requires atleast 3 ?
xTR PLUs since 1) two noun phrases, the Rus-sian and women, need but currently lack thematic roles;and 2) the operator in the specifier position of the mod-ifying Comp phrase can be associated with a thematicrole, but currently is not linked to one.
Since the dif-ference between these loads is 2 ?
XTR, a garden-patheffect results.Consider now (36):(36) # John told the man that Mary kissed that Bill sawPhil.11Note that model that I am proposing here is a parallelmodel, and therefore isnondeterministic.44When parsing sentence (36), people will initiallyanalyze the CP that Mary kissed unambiguously asan argument of the verb told.
It turns out that thishypothesis i  incompatible with the rest of the sentence,so that a garden-path effect results.
In order to see howthe garden-path effect comes about, consider the parsestate which occurs after the word Mary is read:(37) a.
\[tp ~P John \] Ice Iv, Iv told \] \[wp the man \] \[cpthat \] be ~P Mary \] \]\] \]\]\]b. bp \[We John \] \[vp \[v, \[v told \] \[wp the \[W, \[W,man/\] \[cp bvp O/\] that bp bvp Mary \] \]\] \]\]7Structure (37a) requires no load by the PTA sincethe 0-grid of the only 0-assigner is filled with struc-tures that each contain thematic elements.
However,the noun phrase Mary requires XrR PLUs by the Prop-erty of Thematic Reception since this NP is in a the-matic position but does not yet receive athematic role.Thus the total load associated with structure (37a) isxrR PLUs.
Structure (37b), on the other hand, requiresa load OfXTA +2*XTR since 1) the thematic role PROPOSI-TION is not yet assigned by the verb told; 2) the operatorin the specifier position of the CP headed by that is notlinked to a thematic role; and 3) the NP Mary is inthematic position but does not receive a thematic roleyet.
Thus the load difference isxrA +XrR PLUs, enoughfor the more expensive one to be dropped.
Thus onlystructure (37a) is maintained and a garden-path effecteventually results, since this structure is not compati-ble with the entire sentence.
Hence the Properties ofThematic Assignment and Reception make the correctpredictions with respect to (36).Consider the garden-path sentence in (38):(38) # John gave the boy the dog bit a dollar.This sentence causes a garden-path effect since thenoun phrase the dog is initially analyzed as the directobject of the verb gave rather than as the subject of arelative clause modifier of the NP the boy.
This garden-path can be explained in the same way as previousexamples.
Consider the state of the parse after the NPthe dog has been processed:(39) a. be \[We John \] \[vP Iv, \[v gave \]\[Ne the boy \] \[W~,the dog 1\]\]\]b.
\[u, ~t, John \] \[re \[v, \[v gave \] \[wp the \[N, \[W,boyi \] Ice \[we Oi\] be \[we the dog \] \]\] \[we \] 777\]7While structure (39a) requires no load at this stage,structure (39b) requires 2 ?
xrR + XrA PLUs since 1)one thematic role has not yet been assigned by the verbgave; 2) the operator in the specifier position of theCP modifying boy is not linked to a thematic role; and3) the NP the dog is in a thematic position but doesnot yet receive a thematic role.
Thus structure (39a) isstrongly preferred and a garden-path effect results.The garden-path effect in (40) can also be easilyexplained in this framework:(40) # The editor authors the newspaper hired likedlaughed.Consider the state of the parse of (40) after the wordauthors has been read:(41) a.
\[o, bop the editor \] \[w, Iv, Iv authors \] bee \] \]\]\]b.
\[n, ~e the be, be, editor/\] \[cp Lvp Oi \] \[11, Meauthors \] \]\] \]\]\]The word authors is ambiguous between ominaland verbal interpretations.
The structure including theverbal reading is associated with XrA PLUs since the0-grid for the verb authors includes an unassigned role.Structure (41b), on the other hand, includes threenoun phrases, each of which is in a position that maybe linked to a thematic role but currently is not linkedto any 0-role.
Thus the load associated with structure(41b) is 3 ?
XrR PLUs.
Since the difference betweenthe loads associated with structures (41b) and (41a) isso high (3 ?
XrR -- XTA PLUs), only the inexpensivestructure, structure (41a), is maintained.5 PROCESSING OVERLOADThe Properties of Thematic Assignment and Recep-tion also give a plausible account of the unacceptabilityof sentences with an abundance of center-embedding.Recall that I assume that a sentence is unacceptablebecause of short term memory overload if the com-bination of memory associated with properties of thestructures built at some stage of the parse of the sen-tence is greater than the allowable processing load K.Consider (42):(42) # The man that the woman that the dog bit likeseats fish.Having input the noun phrase the dog the structurefor the partial sentence is as follows:(43) \[o, \[top the \[to, \[/?, mani \] \[o, ~p Oi \] that \[tP \[s,Pthe \[~, ~, womanj \] \[cP \[NP Oj \] that \[lP \[NP the dog \]\]\]\]In this representation there are three lexical nounphrases that need thematic roles but lack them.
Fur-thermore, there are two non-lexical NPs, operators, thatare in positions that may prospectively be linked tothematic roles.
Thus, under my assumptions, the loadassociated with this representation is at least 5 ?
xrRPLUs.
I assume that these properties are responsiblefor the unacceptability of this sentence, resulting in theinequality in (44):(44) 5 * xTR > KNote that sentences with only one relative clausemodifying the subject are acceptable, asis exemplifiedin (45)(45) The man that the woman likes eats fish.Since (45) is acceptable, its load is below the max-imum at all stages of its processing.
After processingthe noun phrase the woman in (45), there are three nounphrases that currently lack 0-roles but may be linked to0-roles as future input appears.
Thus we arrive at theinequality in (46):(46) 3 ?
XTR <_ K45Thus I assume that the maximum processing loadthat people can handle lies somewhere above 3 ?
xrRPLUs but somewhere below 5 ?
xrR PLUs.
Althoughthese data are only suggestive, they clearly make theright kinds of predictions.
Future research should es-tablish the boundary between acceptability and unac-ceptability more precisely.6 CONCLUSIONSSince the structural properties that are used in the for-marion of the inequalities are independently motivated,and the system of inequalities i solvable, the theoryof human sentence processing presented here makesstrong, testable predictions with respect to the process-ability of a given sentence.
Furthermore, the success ofthe method provides empirical support for the particu-lar properties used in the formation of the inequalities.Thus a theory of PLUs, the preference factor P andthe overload factor K provides a unified account of 1)acceptability and relative acceptability; 2)garden-patheffects; and 3) preferred readings for ambiguous input.7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Robin Clark, Dan Everett, RickKazman, Howard Kurtzman and Eric Nyberg for com-ments on earlier drafts of this work.
