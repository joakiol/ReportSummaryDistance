WHY THERE MUST BE A SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION (OVER AND ABOVEANY COG~TIVE ~ETWORK)Th.

cannot be d ispensed wi th  ina model of  language comprehension which incorporates  a re -p resentat ion  of  knowledge, commonly ca l led  a oo~i t ive  net -work (e .g .
Qu?11ian, Lamb, Shank, Hays, Jackendof f ,  .

.We sha l l  demonstrate  th i s  in  severa l  ways, c la iming  to  re -so lve  the content ion  between those WhO c la im they are necess -ary  ( the  1st camp above) and those who would o ls /m that  theycan be d ispensed w i th ,  the 2nd oemp, inc lud ing  a l so  Hontague,who uses them for "conven ience  on ly" .F i r s t ,  and most in tu i t i ve ly ,  i s  the  observat ion  that.h i  can and commonly does understand a descr ip t ion  of  some-th ing  (e .g .
a sc ient i f i c  theory ,  or  a po l i t i ca l  t rac t )  whichone knows or  be l ieves  to be at  var iance  wi th  the  fac ts .
Thissuggests  that  in - taken  in fo rmat ion  i s  kept apar t  from genera lknowledge, unt i l  such t ime as one dec ides  to  accept  i t  aat rue .
Cogn i t ive  networks can, however,  be augmented to  accountfo r  th i s  by annotat ing  arcs  by the i r  (episteeLic)  source ,though th i s  i s  a b i t  unrea l i s t i c  fo r  most human use o f  langu-age - we seldom know the source  of  some be l ieved  fac t .A 2nd demonst ra t ion  i s  to  note  that  the norms~ person"knows" o f  many d i f fe rent  wor lds ,  where fac ts  are  at  var ian -ce w i th  those  of  an o ther  wor ld .
As a sc ient i f i c  example,Riemsnian and Euc led ian  geometr ies  are  such cont rary  wor lds ,- 134  -as are any pa i r  of  compet~ theor ies .
For  more ord inaryexamples, most Eng l i sh  speakers  know of at  leas t  4 d i f fe rentwor lds ,  conta?ning d i f fe rent  ob jec ts ,  d i f fe rent  poss ib i l i t i es ,and so on: the world of  @reek mytho lo~ (conta4nLng un icorns ,gods, e tc . )
,  the  wor ld of  Sher lock  Holmes (wi th  a cer ta in  DrWatson, a Baker S t ,  .
.
. )
,  the wor ld of  James Bond, and the" rea l "  wor ld.
As fo r  the rea l  wor ld ,  one 's  in ter locutor  o f tenhas a d i f fe rent  vers ion  of i t ,  which must be known to  under -s tand h is  speech.Now, i f  one must incorporate  in  h imse l f  knowledEe of  4or  so d?st inot  worlds (and I would suggest  i t  i s  c loser  to  40than 4) ,  then we may say he has as me~y cogn i t ive  networks,of  v~dus  degrees  of  d ete?1 and completeness .
These networksmay be represented  as conf la ted  in to  one super  cogn i t ive  net rwork, wi th su f f i c ient  spec ia l  marking o f  the type eu~estedabove (extended to  nodes,  a l so ) ,  but such a oonf la ted  networkcan always be decomposed in to  separate  ones fo r  the venouswor lds ,  i f  i t  i s  adequate ly  marked to  model human behawlour.I f  then there  are a number of  d i s t inc t  cogn i t ive  net -works needed fo r  unders tand ing  ord inary  human speech,  therei s  no reason  not  to  add 1 more fo r  the  conversat ion  cur rent lyin  p rogress .
This i s  no more nor less  than a semant ic  repres -entat ion ,  except as we sha l l  observe below, i t  d i f fe rs  ins t ruc ture ,  and funct ion .A t ighter ,  but longer  and more d i f f i cu l t ,  demonst ra t ioni s  tO show that  " in fe renc ing" ,  which i s  rough ly  equ iva lent  tomoving through a cogn i t ive  network,  i s  NOT undertaken unt i lthe sem~utio operat ion  of  in tegrat ion  i s  a t tempted .
Thisoperat ion ,  which combines the semant ic  cont r ibut ions  ofsentences  together ,  depends heav i ly  on a pr inc ip le  wherebyeach success ive  sentence i s  in terpreted  in  the most redundantway poss ib le ,  so that  i t  "over laps"  as much as poss ib le  wi ththe content  of the prev ious  sentences .- 135 -t~With th i s  p r inc ip le ,  we can show that  in fe renc ingappears to be undertaken only  when in tegrat ion  i s  b locked fo rlack  of  aver lap  of  the expressed meanings of  the componentsentences .
( In fe renc ing  i s  of  course requ i red  fo r  argument,fo r  determ, tnAng t ru th  of  an asser t ion ,  or fo r  o therw ise  app ly -ing  the comprehension of a language act  aga ins t  the wor ld .
)These "expressed  meanings of  the  d i scourse"  are  noth ing  morethan the i r  sen~nt ic  representat ion ,  ld~ich we have thus shownto  b9 necessar i l y  he ld  d i s t inc t  from background knowledgeused in  ln fe reno ing ,  represented  in  a cogn i t ive  network.We can conc lude,  then ,  that  in  some form or  o ther ,  arepresentat ion  of the semantic  e f fec ts  of  the  sentences  i sneeded to account fo r  how d iscourses  are unders tood .
Al thoughth i s  semant ic  representat ion  me~ be conf la ted  ( in  a computer,e .g . )
w i th  a co~j~it ive network,  i t  i s  l og ica l ly  d i s t inc t ,and may be pro f i tab ly  so - t reated .This sems~utic representat ion ,  we may observe ,  i s  d i s t -inc t  from the ord inary  cogn i t ive  network in  being ext remelyundeta i~ea  conta ih ing  most ly  syntagmat ic  ra ther  than pars -d l~nat lo  re la t io f i sh ips ,  and very  ma l leab le ,  and i t  has apr iva ' ledged pos i t ion  in  the in terpreta t ion  of  language acts .I t  i s  a l so  used pri~ns~rily, at  speech t ime,  as a depos i to ry ,w i th  perhaps no in fe renc i~,  whi le a co~l i t i ve  network asgenera l ly  understood rece ives  perhaps, noth ing  at  speech t ime,but ie  used pr imar i l y  fo r  in fe renc ing .
Thus they  appear to  bequ i te  d i s t inc t  in  contents ,  funct ion  and usage.136 -
