INTRODUCTIONThe negative feedback loop which maintains a steady blood pressure in the human body is one of themore difficult topics for first-year medical students to master.
CIRCSIM-Tutor v. 3 is the latest in a seriesof dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems intended to help students master the concepts involved.CIRCSIM-Tutor v. 3 differs from many other ITSs in that text planning is an integral part of the systemrather than part of a natural-language front-end.
It contains a global planner whose fundamental goal i s"generate a conversation resulting in the student knowing <concepts>" rather than "teach <concepts>.
"Constraints on the plan operators can be used to take a variety Of knowledge Sources into account,including the tutorial history, the domain knowledge base and a student model.To ensure that CIP, CSiM-Tutor is useful in the classroom, we have paid particular attention to broadcoverage of the domain, maintenance ofa coherent conversation and fast response time.
We often need tomodel what human tutors do without a deep model of why they say what they say.
As a result our contentplanner uses a schema-based.representation whichallows us to control the decomposition a d sequenceof goals.
Through the use of a reactive planning architecture, we can update our plan based on thestudent's answers.
Text realization is accomplished via a high-level template mechanism based on amini-syntax of potential answers.
Botl!
the content schemata and the text realization templates are basedon detailed modeling of the dialogu epatterns of expert human tutors.2, DESCRIPTION OF DOMAIN AND USER INTERFACECIRCSIM-Tut0r helps students practice the reasoning they have learned in Introduction to Physiology.Students are given a simplified qualitative model of the heart, followed by a series of problems whichutilize the model.
In each problem, an incident such as the administration f a drug affects the processingThis work was supported by the Cognitive Science Program, Office of Naval Research under Grant No.

The student is then asked to predict ile direction of change of seven core variables:HR: Heart rate (beats/min) MAP:IS: Inotropic state, a measure of the SV:heart's contractile ability " CVP:TPR: Total peripheral ?resistance CO:The qualitative causal relationships between the core variables (i.e.
an increase in X causes anMean arterial pressureStroke volume (vol/beat)Central venous pressureCardiac output (vol/min)increase/decrease in Y) are shown on tlie left-hand side of Figure I.
In this diagram, NS = nervoussystem and Baro = the baroreceptors in the neck which recognize a change in blood pressure.
A finer-grained knowledge representation is also available for the tutor to usewhen needed.
A section of thisknowledge base, the leg from the nervous ystem to TPR, is shown on tlie right-hand side of Figure 1.Each variable must be Predicted at three points: the DR or direct response phase immediately after theincident, the RR or reflex response phase, which shows the effect of the nervous ystem, and the SS orsteady state phase after a new steady state has emerged.
After the predictions are made, ?
the tutor engagesthe student in a dialogue to help the student learn the correct answers and file concepts underlying them.The basic user interface is tile screen shown in Figure 2.
A description of  the current problem is shown atthe top of the screen.
The left-hand Side of the screen contains a table where the student can fill inpredictions for tile three stages, and the right-hand side contains awindow where the dialogue volves.The student part of tile dialogue is free text.
Instead of restricting what students can say, we attempt toguide them toward understandable responses through the way the questions are framed, e.g.
by askingshort-answer questions instead of open-ended ones.
Input processing is based on finite-state transducers.Eachquestion the system can ask is associated with a transducer which can categorize and extract avariety of student answers.
Often if the student just uses some of the right words, the sentence is acceptedsince the input processor uses very little syntax.
Spelling correction, an essential in any system whichallows free-text typing, is based on algorithms developed by Elmi \[1998\].
Tile transducers were coded byhand using as input both dialogues with human tutors and logs from earlier versions of CIRCSIM-Tutor.F1-  ?F+q?+qI Nervous ystem II Arteriolar muscle tone I\[ Arteriolar diameter ,I,L-Arteriolar esistance l++I IFigure 1: Two aspects of the CIRCSIM-Tutor domain model2813.
DIALOGUES GENERATED BYTHE SYSTEMAt the top levels, the conversation generated by the system is hierarchical.
Within each stage, the text isdivided into segments, one for each ?incorrect core variable.
The variables are discussed in a partiallyordered sequence which corresponds tothe solution trace of the problem.Each variable is tutored using one of a number of tutoring methods which we have isolated from studiesof human tutoring transcripts.
The tutoring methods are implemented using an extended form of schemawhich allows full unification, static and dynamic preconditions, and recursion.
The following schema istypical (schemata are implemented in Lisp):To correct student's ideas about any variable ?v controlled by the nervous ystem?

And what stage are we in now??
S tudent  notes  go here.
!i|Figure 2: User interface screenEach tutoring method is composed of a number of topics.
Unless it includes a recursive call to anotherschema, each topic is instantiated using standard text generation primitives like elicit and inform.
Inaddition to arguments specifying the content, the primitives can be modified with arguments specifyingwhere the primitive falls on Halliday's interpersonal nd narrative axes.
Thus, for example, a sentencelike Remember that we're in the pre-neural period could be generated from a form like <T-informsinfo=DR-info attitude=remind>.
Optional arguments are also provided for generating several kinds o fdiscourse markers and temporal clauses.Instead of planning the complete text as in a monologue, we interleave planning and execution, planningonly as much as necessary to generate the next turn.
When the student gives an unexpected response,which includes various kinds of "near-misses" as well as wrong answers, we can choose between retryingthe current goal, adding a new g0al at the top of the agenda, or dropping the current schema ndreplacing it by another one.
In this way We can reply flexibly to the student while still maintaining a long-282(1) Can you tell me how TPR is controlled?
