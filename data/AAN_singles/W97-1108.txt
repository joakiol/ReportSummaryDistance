L inear izat ion  of  Non l inear  Lexica l  Representat ionsGeorge  Anton  K i razBell Laboratories700 Mountain Ave.Murray Hill, NJ 07974Email: gkiraz@research, bell-labs, cornAbst rac tThis paper presents a new schema for han-dling nonli:near morphology.
The schemaargues for linearizing nonlinear epresen-tations before applying phonological andmorphological rules.1 In t roduCt ion  and  Prob lemStatementLanguages which exhibit emplatic morphology havebeen lately treated using multi-tape finite statetransducers, with one tape representing surfaceforms and the remaining tapes representing lexicalforms (see (Kay I 1987; Kiraz, Forthcoming)).
Thereare a number of:advantages forusing this multi-tapemodel.
Not only does it accurately represent the lin-guistic insights behind the templatic nonlinear na-ture of these languages, it also allows the computa-tional linguist to compile efficient, relatively smallmorphological l~xica as opposed to lexica containingmillions of entri&s.However, maintaining a nonlinear lexical represen-tation has its ow h inconveniences and computationalcomplexities.
Firstly, the writer of multi-tape rulesmust keep tracl~ of multiple representations (fourin the case of Semitic as opposed to two for En-glish), which makes, writing grammars an arduoustask.
Secondly, !rules which describe one phonolog-ical/orthographi!c phenomenon must be duplicatedin order to accohnt for the nonlinear nature of the.I stem, but the linear nature of segments present inprefixes and sufi0xes.
Thirdly, in systems which re-quire multiple sots of rules (say a text-to-phonemesystem with two!
sets of rules: surface-to-lexical andlexical-to-phoneme), the above complexities multi-ply.
Finally, the're is the issue of space complexity:I although the sPace complexity for transitions of anautomata with respect o the number of tapes is tin-ear, space can b@come costly for huge machines, es-pecially those whose number of transitions exceedsby far the number of states, a typical situation innatural language problems.This paper provides a finite-state schema withwhich one can maintain the nonlinear lexical rep-resentation in templatic morphology, yet alowfor a linear model for representing phonologi-cal/orthographic and other script related rules.
Suchrules are in fact linear and need not be made com-plex on the account of the nonlinear templatic phe-nomenon of morphology.2 P rob lems in Templat i cMorpho logy2.1 Nonl inearity vs. L inear i tyConsider the infamous Arabic stem/katab/ ' to write-- PERFECT ACT IVE ' .
It is derived from the root mor-pheme {ktb) 'notion of writing', the vocalism mor-pheme {a} 'PERFECT ACTIVE' and .the rather ab-stract pattern morpheme {CVCVC} 'VERB.'
Thelatter describes the interdigination of the root andvocalism.
Substituting the Cs with the root conso-nants and the Vs with the vocalism vowels resultsin the surface form /katab/.
This process is illus-trated along the lines of (McCarthy, 1981) - basedon autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith, 1976) asfollows:= /katab/ C V C V CI I Ik t bSimilarly, applying the same process on the root{sdq} 'notion of truth' results in the verb /s.adaq/'to speak the truth - PERFECT ACTIVE'.The stems /katab/ and /s.adaq/ may be pre-fixed and suffixed to fomn other words.
Prefixa-tion and sumxation, however, are linear operationsin Semitic.
In other words, the lexical representationof the prefixes and suffixes does not require multi-57ple tapes.
Hence, the prefix {wa} 'and' is applied tothe above stems to fo rm/wakatab /and/w~adaq/ ,respectively.2.2 Phonolog ica l  and Or thograph ic  RulesSurface-to-lexical mappings must account for phono-logical and orthographic processes.
In fact, for manylanguages, the phonological and orthographic rulestend to be more numerous than the morphologicalrules.
This is the case in Semitic.
For example,the Syriac grammar eported in (Kiraz, 1996) con-tains 48 rules.
Only six rules (a mere 12.5%) 1 aremotivated by templatic morphology.
The rest arephonological and orthographic.Consider the above derivation of /katab/ ,  but forSyriac rather than Arabic (both languages share thesame morphemes in this case).
Syriac has the VowelDeletion RuleV ~ e /__  CVwhere e is the empty string.
The rule states thatshort vowels in open syllables are deleted.
Hence,*/katab/ ~ /ktab/.
The rule applies right-to-left;hence, when adding the object pronominal suffix{eh} 'MASCULINE 3RD SINGULAR', the second vowelis deleted, * /katabeh/~/katbeh/ .Similarly, prefixing the above {wa} morpheme(which is also shared by Syriac and Arabic), re-sults in */wakatab/ ~ /waktab/ (first stem vowelis deleted), and * /wakatabeh/~/wkatbeh/ (pre f ixvowel and second stem vowel are deleted).It is worth noting that such phonological rulesdo not depend on the nonlinear lexical structureof the stem.
They actually apply on the morpho-logically derived stem.
Semitic, then, maintainsat least the following strata: lexical-morphological(where the lexical representation is nonlinear) andmorphological-surface (where both representationsare linear).2.3 Other  L inguist ic  Representat ionsSo far we have looked at two linguistic representa-tions: lexical and surface (~ orthographic).
Nowconsider a text-to-speech system which requires aphonological representation aswell.In the Arabic example above, the first phonemeof /sadaq/ is emphatic (denoted by the sublineardot).
This emphasis is spread at the phonologi-cal level resulting in \[s.a.d.aq\] (\[q\] is already an em-1Had the grammar been more exhaustive, the per-centage would be much less since most additions to therules would be in the domain of phonology/orthography,rather than templatic morphology.phatic phoneme).
2 In this case, emphasis can bedetermined from the surface (~ orthographic) form.However, this is not always the case.
Syriac spi-rantization requires lexical information as the fol-lowing example illustrates: Synchronically speaking,the six plosives \[b\], \[g\], \[d\], \[k\], \[p\] and \[t\] undergospirantization when in postvocalic position wilh re-spect to the lexical form, 3 resulting in \[v\], \[~\], [b\], \[x\],If\] and \[0\], respectively.
Hence, */katab/--~ \[k0av\],and */wakatab/--~ \[wax0av\] (in both cases the firststem vowel is deleted as described above).3 Mu l t i -Tape  GrammarThis section provides a grammar for the above datausing a multi-tape model and illustrates ome of thecomplexities involved in maintaining multiple lexicaltapes throughout.
The multi-tape model (originallyproposed by (Kay, 1987)) is an extension to the com-monly used regular rewrite rules.
In the multi-tapeversion, more than one lexical tape is allowed.
Here,we shall use the following formalism - which derivesfrom the one reported by (Pulman and Hepple, 1993)- to express regular rewrite rules:LLC - LEx - RLC {:::~,~-:~)LSC - SURF  - -  I :~SCwhere LLC is the left lexical context, L~x is thelexical form, RLC is the right lexical context, LSCis the left surface context, SURF is the surface form,and RSC is the right surface context.
The operatorsand ?
:~ indicate optional and obligatory rules, re-spectively.
In the multi-tape version, lexical expres-sions are n-tuple of regular expressions of the form(xl, x2, ..., x, 0, with the ith expression referringto symbols on the ith lexical tape.
When n = 1,the parentheses can be ignored; hence, (x) and x areequivalent .4The grammars presented here assumes a lexiconwith the morpheme ntries presented above.
Thepattern morpheme is {cvcvc} (in small letters); cap-itals in rules denote variables drawn from a finite-setof symbols.Lexieal expressions make use of three tapes: pat-tern, root and vocalism, respectively.
Hence, the2The scope of emphasis i  another challenging prob-lem.
Sometimes emphasis preads till the end of thecurrent syllable, and sometimes till the end of the word.3Diachronically speaking, early Aramaic idioms, ofwhich Syriac is one, did not apply the above vowel dele-tion rule; hence, in the New Testament the first \[a\] insabachthani (Mt 27:46) is retained.
Later, however, thevowel deletion rule took effect, but spirantized conso-nants remained as if the deletion did not take place.4For compiling such rules into automata, see(Grimley-Evans, Kiraz, and Pulman, 1996).Grammar  1 Grammar  for Arab ic / (wa)katab/and/(wa)s. adaq/* - <c;C,~> - *R1 , _ IC - ** - (v:,c,a) - *R2 .

Pre-fixation and suffixation, which for the most part fallout of the domain of templatic morphology, are rep-resented as a sequence of segments as in any otherlanguage and ate placed on the first (pattern) lexicaltape.

Note that the prefix shares a tapewith the pattern.3.2 Phono log ica l  and  Or thograph ic  Ru lesThe Syriac vowel deletion rule, V ---+ e/ CV,is given in the notation of our formalism in Gram-mar 2.
Note that by virtue of its right-lexical con-text (cv,C,a), R4 can only apply to the first stemvowel as illustrated in the derivation o f /k tab / f romthe underlying * /katab /by  the deletion of the firstvowel:SHaving tile prefixes hare a tape of tile patterns is amatter of convenience since the number of segments in apattern, more or less, corresponds to that on the surfacemore than segments of roots and vocalisms.l a l a t Vocalismk t I I b Rootc v c iv i c  Pattern14121Ik t la!blSurfaceAnother rule (R5 in Grammar  2) is required forderiving * /katab/  + {eh} ~ /katbeh/ ,  where thesecond stem vowel is deleted by the same phono-logical phenomenon.

The firsthandles the templatic nature of morphology, map-ping the multiple lexical representation i to a lin-ear i zed  lexieal  form.
This linearized form main-tains the same linguistic information of the originallexical representation, and somewhat corresponds toMcCarthy's notion of t ier  conf lat ion (McCarthy,1986).The second takes care of phonological/ ortho-graphic/graphemic mappings between the linearizedlexical form and the actual surface.
The combinedmachine is mathematically taken as the composi-tion of the two machines representing the two sets ofrules.
This brings us to the question of composingmulti-tape automata.4.1 Compos i t ion  of  Mu l t i -Tape  MachinesThe composition of two binary transducers A and Bis straightforward since one tape is taken for inputand the other for output.
The composition of thetwo machines is a generalization of the intersectionof the same two automata in that each state in theresulting machine is a pair drawn from one state inA and the other from B, and each transition corre-sponds to a pair of transitions, one from A and theother from B, with compatible labels.The composition of multi-tape transducers, how-ever, is ambiguous.
Which tapes are input andwhich are output?
Consider the machine which ac-cepts the regular relation 6 a*:b*:b* and a secondmachine which accepts the regular elation b* :b* :c*.The composition of the two machines can be eitherthe machine accepting a* :c* or the machine accept-ing a* :b* :b* :c*.
However, if tapes can be marked asbelonging to the domain or range of the transduc-tion, the ambiguity will be resolved.Formally, an n - tape f in l te -s tate  automaton  isa 5-tuple M = (Q, Z, 5, q0, F), where Q is a finiteset of states,  E is a finite input  a lphabet  (a setof n-tuples of symbols), t~ is a t rans i t ion  funct ionmapping Q x E'~ to Q, q0 E Q is an init ial  state,and F C Q is a set of f inal states.
An n-tape FSAaccepts an n-tuple of strings if and only if startingfrom the initial state q0, it can scan all the symbols6For regular relations, see (Kaplan and Kay, 1994).on every tape i, 1 _< i < n, and end up in a finalstate q E F.An n- tape f in i te -s ta te  t ransducer  is a 6-tupleM = (Q,E,5 ,  qo, F ,d) ,  where Q, .~, 6, q0 and Fare like before and d, 1 < d < n, is the number ofdomain  tapes.
The number of range  tapes  issimply n - d.Let A = (Qi, El, 51, ql, Fi, dl) and B =(Q2, E2, 52, q2, F2, d2) be two multi-tape transducersover nl and n2 tapes, respectively.
Further, let sidenote the symbol on the ith tape.
There is a com-position of A and B, denoted by C, if and only ifd2 = nl  -- dlwithC = (Q1 ?

This enables theuser to change the value of d per operation if theneed arises.4.2 A M ixed  GrammarNow we illustrate the advantage of having a lin-earized lexical form by developing a mixed grammar.We make use of two grammars for the data pre-sented above.
G1 for templatic nonlinear problemsand G2 for linear issues.
For the current data, ourG1 would be similar to the rules in Grammar 1.G2 takes as input the output of G1, i.e., the lin-earized lexical form such as Syriac * /katab/ ,  */wal-adakatab/, etc.
Since R4-R7 in Grammar 2 rep-resent the one phonological phenomenon, viz., thedeletion of a short vowel in an open syllable, theycan be combined into one rules:* - a - CVR8 * - - *where C is a consonant and V is a vowel~oGrammar  3 Grammar for Spirantization, case for\[b\]--~ Iv\]V - b - * ?~ lZ9 .

After all, only three ruleswere saved.
However, note that almost all of therules in a real grammar do not belong to the tem-platte morphology domain, but to the linear phono-logical\]orthographic domain.
Consider the case ofSyriac spirantization mentioned above, viz.,\[- plosive\] ~ \[+ fricative\] / V __Each of the six Syriac plosives requires a set ofrules of the form in Grammar 3 :R9  applies whenthe center and context belong to prefixes and suf-fixes, R10 applies when the center belongs to thestem and the context belongs to a prefix, and R l lapplies when the center and context belong to thestem.
(Since Syriac stems invariably end in conso-nants, there is no rule for the case when the centerbelongs to a suffix and the right context o the stemin this case.)
To cover all six plosives, 18 rules arerequired.
If, however, the rules are to apply on thelinearized lexical form, each plosive requires only onerule similar to R9 (a total of six rules).iP,5 Conc lus i lonUsing a lineari~ed form provides a pragmatic solu-tion to the pr6blems discussed above.
While thetemplatic mo@hology issues are resolved using amulti-tape grammar, the linear-in-nature phonologi-cal/graphemic issues are dealt with using a two-tapegrammar as in lany other Western language.
As il-lustrated with ithe vowel deletion rule above, thismakes the task Iof the grammar writer easier by far.In addition, the size of the intermediate automata issubstantially decreased in terms of space complexity.There is another advantage of this model if usedin a multi-lingual Semitic environment system.
Wenoted above how the derivation o f /katab / in  Arabicand Syriac is similar.
The only difference is that inthe latter a vowel deletion rule takes place.
It isthen possible to generalize the lexical-to-linearized-form module for more than one Semitic language.At the abstract finite-state level, our solution mayhave some similarities with the proposal of (Kor-nat, 1991) which aims at modeling autosegmentalphonology by coding nonlinear autosegmental repre-sentations as linear strings.
Kornai's approach lin-earizes the lexical nonlinear epresentation from theoutset using a number of coding mechanisms.ReferencesGoldsmith, J.
