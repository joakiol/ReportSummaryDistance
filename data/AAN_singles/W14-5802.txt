This paper describes the interplay and interac-tive utilization of different language technology tools and resources, in particular the Swedishlexicon SALDO and Swedish Constructicon, in the creation of Swedish FrameNet.
We showhow integrating resources in a larger infrastructure is much more than the sum of the parts.1 IntroductionThis paper describes how Swedish language technology resources are exploited to construct SwedishFrameNet (SweFN),1a lexical-semantic resource that has been expanded from and constructed in linewith Berkeley FrameNet (BFN).
The resource has been developed within the framework of the theoryof Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1985).
According to this theory, semantic frames including their partic-ipants represent cognitive scenarios as schematic representations of events, objects, situations, or statesof affairs.
The participants are called frame elements (FEs) and are described in terms of semantic rolessuch as AGENT, LOCATION, or MANNER.
Frames are evoked by lexical units (LUs) which are pairingsof lemmas and meanings.To get a visualization of the notion of semantic frames consider the frame Vehicle landing.
Ithas the following definition in BFN: ?A flying VEHICLE comes to the ground at a GOAL in a controlledfashion, typically (but not necessarily) operated by an operator.?
VEHICLE and GOAL are the coreelements that together with the description uniquely characterize the frame.
Their semantic types arePhysical object and Location.
The non-core elements of the frame are: CIRCUMSTANCES, COTHEME,DEGREE, DEPICTIVE, EVENT DESCRIPTION, FREQUENCY, GOAL CONDITIONS, MANNER, MEANS,MODE OF TRANSPORTATION, PATH, PERIOD OF ITERATIONS, PLACE, PURPOSE, RE ENCODING,SOURCE, and TIME.
The lexical units evoking the frame are: land.v, set down.v, and touch down.v.
Inaddition, the frame contains a number of example sentences which are annotated in terms of LUs andFEs.
These sentences carry valence information about different syntactic realizations of the FEs andabout their semantic characteristics.Currently SweFN contains around 1,150 frames with over 29,000 lexical units of which 5,000 areverbs, and also 8,300 semantically and syntactically annotated sentences, selected from a corpus.SweFN has mainly been created manually, but as a response to an ever increasing complexity, volume,and specialization of textual evidence, the creation of SweFN is enhanced with automated Natural Lan-guage Processing (NLP) techniques.
In contrast to the construction of English resources, as well as theconstruction of framenets for other languages, the resources used to construct SweFN are all linked in aunique infrastructure of language resources.2 The development of framenets in other languagesFrameNet-like resources have been developed in several languages and have been exploited in a rangeof NLP applications such as semantic parsing (Das et al., 2014), information extraction (Moschitti etThis work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

SweFN has focused on transferring frames and populating them with LUs.
For eachframe there are annotated example sentences extracted from corpora.
Sentences illustrate the instanti-ation of a number of LUs and FEs with regard to the frame, but many LUs do not yet have associatedexample sentences.
BFN and Spanish FrameNet (Subirats, 2009) also use isolated corpus sentences forannotation while the SALSA project for German (Burchardt et al., 2009) has the aim of creating full-textannotation of a German corpus.
JFN, Spanish FrameNet, and FN-Br all use BFN software to constructframes, while SweFN uses its own software and tools.
Even though JFN uses BFN software and an-notations tools for as much compatibility with BFN as possible, the Japanese writing system differsconsiderably from that of English, and several modifications have been necessary to handle the differentcharacter systems and word boundary issues.Most framenets have the intention of covering general language.
However, there are domain spe-cific resources such as, the Copa 2014 FrameNet Brasil, a multilingual resource for the language ofsoccer and tourism (Torrent et al., 2014) covering Portuguese, English and Spanish.
Bertoldi and deOliveira Chishman (2011) describe work buiding a FrameNet-like ontology for the language of criminaljustice contrasting the differences between English and Portuguese languages and legal cultures.3 Lexical and grammatical resources and tools for SwedishSwedish FrameNet is part of SweFN++, a larger project with the goal to create a multifaceted panchroniclexical macro-structure for Swedish to be used as an infrastructure component for Swedish languagetechnology and development of NLP applications and annotated corpora.
One goal of SweFN++ is tore-use and enhance existing in-house and external lexical resources and harmonize them into a singlemacro-structure for processing both modern and historic Swedish text (Borin et al., 2010).
Another goalis to release all SweFN++ resources under an open content license.3.1 SALDO ?
association lexiconSALDO (Borin et al., 2013a)3is a Swedish association lexicon which contains morphological andlexical-semantic information for more than 131,000 entries, of which around 10% are verbs.
SALDO en-tries are arranged in a hierarchical structure capturing semantic closeness between lexemes.
Each lexicalentry of SALDO has a unique identifier.
Each lexical entry, except 41 top nodes, also has a main descrip-tor, which may be complemented with a second determinative descriptor.
These descriptors are other,more central, entries from SALDO.
The SALDO entry for the noun flaska ?bottle?, with its descriptors,is shown in figure 1.SALDO is the pivot of all the Swedish lexical language technology resources maintained atSpr?akbanken.
Having one pivot resource makes it possible for all Spr?akbanken resources to be com-patible with each other (Borin and Forsberg, 2014).3.2 Swedish ConstructiconThe Swedish Constructicon (SweCcn)4is an electronic database of Swedish constructions (Lyngfeltet al., 2012; Sk?oldberg et al., 2013).
Just as it is precursor the Berkeley Constructicon,5it builds onexperiences from Construction Grammar and is historically, methodologically and theoretically closelyrelated to Frame Semantics and FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2012).
While framenets map single lexical2http://www.framenetbr.ufjf.br3http://spraakbanken.gu.se/saldo4http://spraakbanken.gu.se/swe/swecxn5http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/?hsato/cxn00/21colorTag/index.html9Figure 1: A search for the noun flaska ?bottle?
in SALDO shows that it only has one sense.
We are alsoshown the lemma, the part of speech, the primary descriptor f?orvara ?store.v?, the secondary descriptorh?alla ?pour.v?, and finally primary and secondary children, that is entries which have flaska as primaryor secondary descriptor.units to the frames they evoke, a constructicon deals with the pairing of form and meaning in morecomplex linguistic units, typically (partially) schematic multiword units that cannot easily be referred toby either grammatical or lexicographic descriptions alone.In SweCcn each construction is described individually in a construction entry, defined by its spe-cific characteristics in form, meaning, function, and distribution.
Each entry includes a free text def-inition, schematic structural description, definitions of construction elements (CEs) and annotated ex-ample sentences.
Since the constructicon must account for both form and meaning, the construc-tion elements can be both semantic roles and syntactic constituents.
For example, the constructionreflexiv resultativ, instantiated in ?ata sig m?att ?eat oneself full?, is defined as a verb phrasewhere somebody (ACTOR) or something (THEME) performs an action (ACTIVITY) that leads to a resultwhich affects the ACTOR/THEME, expressed with a reflexive particle.
The construction roughly means?achieve something by V-ing?, and can be applied to both transitive and intransitive verbs, altering theverbs?
inherent valence restrictions.
The syntactic structure of the construction is [V refl AP], and theconstruction elements are defined as the semantic roles ACTOR, THEME, ACTIVITY and RESULT, aswell as the reflexive particle.
Example sentences like dricka sig full ?drink oneself drunk?
and springasig varm ?run oneself warm?
are added to the entry, while an example like k?anna sig tr?ott ?feel tired?does not fit since one doesn?t get tired by feeling.Swedish Constructicon is developed as an extension of Swedish FrameNet and forms a part of theSweFN++ infrastructure.
Swedish Constructicon currently consists of about 300 construction entries,ranging from general linguistic patterns to partially fixed expressions, of which a significant part are con-structions in the borderland between grammar and lexicon, commonly neglected from both perspectives.3.3 Karp ?
open lexical infrastructureKarp is an open lexical infrastructure with three main functions: (1) support the creation, cura-tion, and mutual integration of the lexical resources of SweFN++; (2) publish all lexical resources atSpr?akbanken, making them searchable and downloadable in various formats such as Lexical MarkupFramework (LMF) (Francopoulo et al., 2006), and Resource Description Framework (RDF) (Lassilaand Swick, 1999); (3) offer advanced editing functionalities with support for exploitation of corporaresources (Borin et al., 2013b).There are 21 resources with over 700,000 lexical entries available in Karp.
Since all resources uti-lize the lexical entries of SALDO, a large amount of information becomes accessible when performingsimple searches.
For example when we look up the SALDO entry flaska..1 ?bottle?, we find informationabout the synset from Swesaurus,6a WordNet-like Swedish resource, as well as synset and sense fromPrinceton WordNet,7syntactic valence from PAROLE,8identifier from Loan Typology Wordlist (LWT),96http://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/resource/swesaurus7http://wordnet.princeton.edu/8http://spraakdata.gu.se/parole/lexikon/swedish.parole.lexikon.html9http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ids/ids.pl?com=simple_browse&lg_id=18710the lexical ID from Lexin,10etc.
Each of these resources is in turn linked to mono- and multi-lingualinformation that can be exploited by any other resource or application.3.4 Korp ?
Swedish corporaKorp is a Swedish corpus search interface developed at Spr?akbanken.
It provides access to over 1.6billion tokens from both modern and historic Swedish texts (Borin et al., 2012; Ahlberg et al., 2013).The interface allows advanced searches and comparisons between different corpora, all automaticallyannotated with dependency structure using MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007).One functionality provided by Korp is Related Words.
This shows a list of words fetched from SALDOwhich are semantically related to the search term.
Only words that actually occur in the corpora areretrieved by this function.
By clicking on one of these, a new corpus search is done with this word assearch term (Borin et al., 2012).
Another functionality in Korp is Word Picture which uses statisticaldata to select typical examples illustrating collocational semantic relations for chosen expressions.
Thisquery system extracts frequent collocations of the word in question along with an analysis of the parts-of-speech of the collocating words.4 The development of SweFNAs described by the BFN research team, manual construction of a framenet resource involves severalsteps, including defining frames and frame elements, collecting appropriate lexical units for the frames,comparing the findings with printed dictionaries, extracting syntactic and collocational contexts to illus-trate the frame, and analyzing sentences to explore the use of LUs (Fillmore et al., 2003).The work procedure of SweFN is based on transfer of information from BFN.
To a large extent wefollow the BFN development process, but the development of SweFN differs in three crucial aspects:(1) when we transfer frames from BFN to Swedish, there is usually no need to re-define them.
How-ever, the frames are checked for compatibility with Swedish language and culture; (2) our inventory ofLUs is derived from the SALDO lexicon; (3) we utilize in-house resources, all linked in the Swedishinfrastructure for language technology, SweFN++.Taking BFN as a starting point saves time and effort in developing frames.
Most of the effort goesto figure out what SALDO entries evoke which frames and to find suitable example sentences.
In orderto find appropriate LUs evoking a particular frame we consult: (1) the lexical resources in Karp (seesection 4.3); (2) printed dictionaries; (3) the corpus infrastructure Korp for concordance search in order toinvestigate additional uses of the words.
This process occasionally results in new frames or modificationof the frames of BFN (see section 4.4).4.1 SALDOThe manual process of constructing a SweFN frame begins with choosing a frame from BFN or word ofinterest.
When we create a frame equivalent to one which already exists in BFN, we transfer the framefeatures which are more or less language independent from the BFN frame to the SweFN frame.
Thesefeatures include frame description, frame-to-frame relations, and FEs.
We then search for appropriateSALDO entries evoking the frame as well as example sentences for annotation.
If suitable entries existin SALDO they are chosen for use as LUs.
Otherwise we suggest entries to be added to SALDO (Borinet al., 2013a).
Each SALDO sense is allowed to populate only one SweFN frame except in a few caseswhere some inflectional forms evoke one frame and other forms another frame.When we instead use a word or expression as a starting point we look up all senses in SALDO andsystematically add each sense to the frame it evokes.
The selection of LUs from SALDO to populatethe frames of SweFN is done in different ways.
One method is to determine which of the English LUsof BFN frames have suitable equivalents in Swedish.
Thereafter different types of searches are madein SALDO.
For example, working on the frame Containers, having introduced the noun LU flaska?bottle?
one can search for entries ending with flaska, thus finding a number of compounds such as cham-pagneflaska ?champagne bottle?, droppflaska ?dropper bottle (med.
)?, eng?angsflaska (one+time+bottle)10http://lexin2.nada.kth.se/lexin/11?non-returnable bottle?, glasflaska ?glass bottle?, halvflaska (half+bottle) ?375ml bottle?, miniatyrflaska?miniature bottle?, nappflaska (pacifier+bottle) ?baby bottle?, sprayflaska (spray+bottle) ?spray can?, tom-flaska ?empty bottle?, vattenflaska ?water bottle?, v?armeflaska (heat+bottle) ?warm water bottle?, to namea few.
Another method is searching for entries having the LU in question as one of the determiners.
Forexample, working on the Animal frame, a search may be done on the determiner djur ?animal?
resultingin a long list of lexical entries for different species of animals, which may be entered into the frame.The possibility of doing searches in SALDO as described above, in combination with compoundingbeing very productive in Swedish, is one reason for the relatively large number of LUs in SweFN.4.2 Swedish ConstructiconConstructions are more complex linguistic units than words, they are common in use and difficult to ig-nore when working with authentic text.
One way to enrich SweFN with more representative examples ofhow to express meaning in language is to include constructions as frame-evoking units in the database.Currently work is being done on systematically linking constructions in SweCcn with frames in SweFN(Ehrlemark, 2014), but the task is not as straight-forward as identifying which frame is evoked by acertain LU.
First, not all constructions evoke frames, carrying little meaning from a semantic point ofview.
This includes such general patterns as constructions for modification, predication, passive voiceor filler-gap constructions.
Second, constructions that potentially correspond with frames do not alwaysfit the distribution pattern of frame elements described in the target frame.
This group includes fig-urative constructions or constructions that are more, or less, general than the target frame in SweFN.Constructions which do correspond with frames may be called frame-bearing constructions (Fillmoreet al., 2012).
A frame-bearing construction evokes a target frame in the same manner as an LU, withmatching construction elements and frame elements.The linking of constructions with frames is carried out through manual analysis of constructions andtheir semantic valence patterns.
The work includes paraphrasing the meaning of a construction to identifywhich frame or frames it may evoke, and thereafter comparing the construction elements with the FEs ofthe target frame.
For example, SweCcn includes three constructions for comparisons: j?amf?orelse?comparison?, which has the two subordinate constructions j?amf?orelse.likhet ?compari-son.similarity?
and j?amf?orelse.olikhet ?comparison.difference?
?
all three are Swedish equiva-lents of corresponding constructions in the Berkeley Constructicon (B?ackstr?om et al., 2014).
In all threecases the CEs in the construction entries correspond to the FEs in the Evaluative comparisonframe which has the following definition: a PROFILED ITEM is compared to a STANDARD ITEM with re-spect to some ATTRIBUTE.
By establishing a link between, in this case the comparison constructionsand the Evaluative comparison frame, we may enrich the frame with typical example sentencessuch as Hennes cykel ?ar b?attre ?an min ?Her bicycle is better than mine?
and Popband ?ar lika arga somrockband ?Popbands are as angry as rockbands?.Another example is the pair of constructions proportion i om and proportion per, whichdistinguish different syntactic patterns for expressing proportion in Swedish.
In both cases,the construction combines two entities, a numerator and a denominator, joined by a preposi-tion.
However, they differ regarding domain of use, preposition used, and definiteness of thesecond noun phrase.
The construction proportion i om describes time, and therefore cor-responds to frames that express proportion in relation to time units, such as Frequency andSpeed description.
The construction proportion per is a more general constructionthat expresses Frequency and Speed description as well as other ratio relations as de-scribed in the frames Relational quantity, Rate quantification, Proportion, andPrice per unit.
Thus, a link between SweFN and SweCcn may refer the user to correct Swedishconstructions for ratio relations from the frames they evoke.At the time of writing, about half of the entries in SweCcn are linked to frames in SweFN.
Thecontinuing work with comparing and linking the two resources does not aim to link all constructionswith frames, but rather to distinguish frame-bearing from non-frame-bearing constructions.
The linkingallows the user to easily go between a construction and the frame or frames it evokes and correspondingly12from a frame to constructions evoking the frame.
In this way, both SweCcn and SweFN become morerepresentative of the language they set out to describe and better incorporated for future pedagogical andlanguage technological uses.4.3 KarpAs well as being the editing tool used to build SweFN and other resources, Karp is an important toolfor accessing information.
Searching on any expression, word form or lemma results in a display ofevery occurrence in all SweFN++ resources, except instances in the corpus.
This gives, for example, anoverview of different senses of polysemous words, in which resources they have been entered and how.Thus, we can see which SweFN frames are evoked by different senses of a word, we can see synonymouswords in Swesaurus (Borin and Forsberg, 2014), the morphology of the word as well as multiword unitscontaining this word in SALDO, samples of sentences from Korp where the chosen word occurs, andconstructions in Swedish Constructicon which use this word (Lyngfelt et al., 2012).SweFN developers use Karp to find SALDO entries that evoke a particular frame, SweCcn developersuse Karp to find frames evoked by constructions, or constructions that evoke frames.
Figure 2 shows anexample of a view in Karp.
In this particular view SweFN and SweCcn resources were selected, but otherchoices are also possible.
The combination of searches shown here are in turn for a certain constructionor frame (two first boxes), for constructions that match a certain frame (third box).
This particular searchis for constructions that match Similarity, which here resulted in 14 different constructions, eachof which contained potential patterns which in turn could be used to perform new searches in Korp.Finally, in the fourth box the search is for a particular SALDO sense, and in the fifth box for a certainLU.
Searches for other types of units such as frame elements, etc.
are also possible.Figure 2: The Karp editing tool provides various functionalities to extract information from a numberof different lexical resources.
The combination of searches above is selected to illustrate the variety ofpossibilities in Karp.134.4 KorpThe Korp corpora and search interface serve several purposes in the creation of SweFN.
The coverageof lexical variation found in corpora is much larger than the variation we find in a lexicon and this helpsin defining senses of polysemous words.
From the corpora, example sentences are extracted to illustratevalence structures of LUs evoking frames.
Korp extended search allows searches that combine SweFNLUs and syntactic structures of SweCcn constructions.
The Related Words function provides a method ofeasily expanding the set of LUs populating a frame and giving easy access to example sentences wherelexical variations are observed.
Word Picture offers guidance in disambiguation as of LUs well as inanalyzing semantic and syntactic structures.Korp is a useful tool to check for compatibility with Swedish language and culture.
Extended searcheshelp us modify BFN frames and create new frames.
There are two situations when BFN frames havebeen modified for SweFN (Heppin and Gronostaj, 2014): (1) the BFN frames are not suitable becauseof linguistic or cultural differences.
For example the BFN frame Jury deliberation has been re-defined to Deliberation in SweFN.
In Deliberation the FE corresponding to the FE JURY inBFN is changed to DELIBERATION GROUP seeing that there is no jury in the Swedish legal processand a more general frame is appropriate as it covers deliberations in different kinds of legal systems;(2) the BFN frames are too general for our purposes, for example Sound makers in BFN correspondsto two more specific frames in SweFN: Noise makers and Musical instruments.
Completelynew frames have also been created when there is a need for a frame not yet created for BFN.
SweFN, forexample, has a greater emphasis on nominal LUs than framenets for other languages.
Therefore, framessuch as Animals, Countries, and Plants have been created.After determining the appropriate pairing of SALDO units and SweFN frames, searches are made forexample sentences manifesting these LUs in the Korp corpora.
The sentences we aim to find should havea variation of valence structure to give a broad overall picture of the LU patterns.Figure 3: Word picture from Korp of the verb bygga ?build?
in present tense, e.g.
bygger.
The columnsdisplay from left to right subjects, objects, and adverbials.
The number to the right in each column is thefrequency of the collocation in Korp.Word Picture is useful when taking a starting point in individual, polysemous words, to determinewhich frames are evoked by the different senses.
In figure 3 items, which are listed in subject and object14positions respectively, highlight two different senses of the verb bygga ?build?, one abstract and oneconcrete sense.
The nouns found in subject position, such as film ?film?, system ?system?, unders?okning?examination?, metod ?method?, rapport ?report?, etc., occur with the sense of bygga ?build?
which istypically found in an abstract intransitive construction with the preposition p?a ?on?
as in ?founded on?,?built on?, or ?based on?.
This sense evokes the Use as a starting point frame.
The nouns in theobject position, such as hus ?house?
and bro ?bridge?, collocate with the agentive verb bygga ?build?
inthe concrete sense of ?construct?
or ?erect?, which evokes the Building frame (Heppin and Gronostaj,2014).5 Consistency checks and automatic extension of the dataThere is no gold standard to evaluate the quality of SweFN against as there is no other comparableresource.
FrameNet-like resources for other languages are constructed with different foci and underdifferent conditions.
However, there is a constant assessment of the correctness of the resources builtinto the workflow and ongoing consistency checks to avoid inconsistency between resources.
The Karptool gives error messages, for example when SALDO entries are listed in more than one frame.
Othertypes of checks are run with certain intervals, for example to see if there are annotation tags which do notfollow the standard format.
Confronted with different types of error messages the developers go back tothe frames in question to revise the contents of the frame, such as which LUs are said to evoke the frame,or the choice of and annotation of example sentences.One part of the work is directed towards developing computational methods to facilitate the man-ual construction of SweFN.
We have so far focused on three tasks: (1) semantic role labeling (SRL)(Johansson et al., 2012); (2) automatic sentence extraction, i.e.
finding example sentences with variedsyntactic and semantic complexities (Pil?an et al., 2013); (3) automatic expansion of the SweFN lexiconto determine which frame is evoked by a given word by combining statistical and rule-based methodsbased on SALDO descriptors and extracted information from Korp (Johansson, 2014).6 ConclusionsThe building of one big macro-resource for Swedish language technology, where the individual resourcesinteract with and enhance each other, provides a unique overview of the Swedish language.
One searchon a lexical expression results in a list of descriptions from all of the separate resources.
The informationderived is not only useful for the end user, but also for the continuing work on all parts of the linguisticmacro-structure.We have here focused on how two language technology resources, SALDO and SweCcn, are exploitedin the development of SweFN, but also on how these resources enhance each other and other resources.We mainly address the manual perspectives of the workflow, illustrating what data may derive from thedifferent resources, how this data may be used to facilitate work, and how the contents of one resourcemay reappear in the contents of another.
We have given a sketch of the language technology tools withthe aim to reveal their potential importance in the development of SweFN.The construction of SweFN, and even more so the construction of a macro-resource such as SweFN++,will continue to develop in the foreseeable future.
New insights as well as new problems will continueto give rise to changes.AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank the Department of Swedish at the University of Gothenburg and thethree anonymous reviewers.
