ON THE INTONATION OF MONO- AND DI-SYLLABIC WORDS WITHIN THEDISCOURSE FRAMEWORK OF CONVERSATIONAL GAMESJacqueline C. Kowtko*Human Communication Research CentreUniversity of Edinburgh2 Buccleuch PlaceEdinburgh EH8 9LW SCOTLANDInternet: J.Kowtko@edinburgh.ac.ukAbst rac tRecent studies on the analysis of intonational func-tion examine a ran~ of materials from cue phrasesin monologue (Litman and Hirschberg, 1990) anddialogue (Hirschberg and Litman, 1987; Hockey,1991) to longer utterances in both monologue anddialogue (McLemore, 1991).
Results match spe-cific intonational tunes to certain discourse func-tions which are more or less well defined.
Al-though these results make a convincing case thatintonation does signal a change in discourse struc-ture, the specification of discourse function re-mains vague.
A suitable taxonomy is needed tofine-tune the relationship between intonation anddiscourse function.
A recent analysis of dialogue(Kowtko et al, 1991) provides a framework of con-versational games which allows more fine-grainedexamination ofprosodic function.
The current pa-per introduces an intonational nalysis of mono-and di-syllabic words based upon such a frame-work and compares results in progress with previ-ous work on intonation.In t roduct ionRecent approaches to the analysis of intonationalfunction within dialogue include an examination fthe tunes carried by single-word cue phrases (e.g.now (Hirschberg and Litman, 1987), okay (Hockey,1991), and others (Litman and Hirschberg, 1990))across different discourse situations.
The litera-ture also includes a more sweeping approach to-ward classifying phrase-final tunes which presentsbroadly generalized discourse functions for each ofthree types of intonational tune: phrase-final r/se,level, and fall (McLemore, 1991).
Since there iscurrently no workable grammar of discourse, thesestudies devise their own relevant discourse cate-gories.
Hockey (1991, p. 1) reflects upon the prob-lem, with reference to cue phrases.

Contextand prosody are major factors contributingto differences in interpretation among variousinstances of a cue phrase.
In order to investi-gate the connection between prosodic featuresand uses of a cue phrase, uses must be iden-tified.The above is partly a response to Himchbergand Litman (1987; Litman and Hirschberg,1990) who limit their description to a binarydiscourse/sentential distinction.
Litman andHirschberg (1990) leave the analysis of cue phrasefunction to the interpretation of various specificdiscourse approaches and instead focus on validat-ing their (1987) prosodic model of cue phrase usewith additional data from monologue.
The modelspecifies that a cue phrase in discourse use will oc-cur either alone in a phrase (with unspecified tune)or initially in a larger phrase (deaccented or witha low tone).
Thus, Litman and Hirschberg leaveopen the question of how their prosodic modelcould further specify discourse function.McLemore (1991) approaches discourse asstructured by topics and interruptions.
Her dataincludes announcements given at Texas sororitymeetings and conversation between members.
Shefinds that phrase-final tunes indicate certain gen-eral functions: rising tune connects, level tune con-tinues, and falling tune segments.
The specificsabout how each of these tunes operates dependsupon the context.
For instance, phrase-final risewhich indicates non-finality or connection mani-fests itself as turn-holding in one context, phrasesubordination i another, and intersentential co-hesion in yet another context.
Likewise, the othertunes perform slight variations on the function ofcontinue and segment according to context, whichis left up to the reader to determine.Hockey (1991) admits to settling upon an ar-bitrary discourse classification and letting her data282speak for itself, after attempting to adopt a sys-tem of analysis based upon a somewhat similar setof speech data 1.
She focuses on task oriented i-alogue and attempts to specify discourse functionof the cue phrase okay.
She presents her resultsin terms of intonational contours and their cor-responding discourse categories, finding that theycorrelate with McLemore's (1991) results: 89% ofrising contour occurs where the speaker was pass-ing up a turn and letting the other person con-tinue; 86% of level contour serves to continue aninstruction; 88% of falling contour marks the endof a subtask.
But her categorization f discourseis still weak.Admittedly, there are a limited number of in-tonational tunes (low rise, high rise, level, fall,etc.).
But limitation in intonational tune shouldnot force a limitation in discourse category.
De-tailed understanding of intonational function isnecessarily linked to a more robust view of dis-course structure.
These previous tudies providegood intonational analysis but within weak dis-course structures.Conversat iona l  Games  in D ia logueThe analysis offered by Kowtko, Isard, and Do-herty (1991) provides an independently definedtaxonomy of discourse structure which allowsa closer examination of how intonation signalsspeaker intention within task oriented ialogue.
Inthe analysis, linguistic exchanges termed conver -sa t iona l  games (from a tradition of literature orig-inating in Power (1974)) embody the initiation-response-feedback patterns which relate to under-lying non-linguistic goals.
It is through the frame-work of games and their components, conversa-tional moves, that the intonation of mono- anddi-syllabic words can be compared with their dis-course function, as intended by the speaker.A conversational game is defined as consist-ing of the turns necessary to accomplish a con-versational goal or sub-goal.
The initiating utter-ance determines which game is being played and issimilar to the core speech act in Traum and Allen(1991).
The ensuing response and feedback movesfunction as presentation and acceptance phases, inthe terms of Clark and Schaefer (1987).
Implicit,mutually agreed rules dictate the shape of a gameand what constitutes an acceptable move within agame.
These rules embody procedural, as opposedto declarative, knowledge which speakers employin everyday conversation.~Hockey had hoped to map discourse categories ofokay based upon data collected from conversation ata library reference desk to that arising from a task inwhich one person described a design for another personto make out of paper clips.283The repertoire of games and moves in Kowtko,Isard and Doherty (1991) is based upon a maptask (see Anderson et al, 1991, for a detailed e-scription): One person is given a map with a pathmarked on it and has to tell another person howto draw the path onto a similar map.
Neither par-ticipant can see the other's map.The nature of the map task is such thatfrom the conversations the speaker's intentionsremain fairly obvious.
Kowtko, Isard, and Do-herty (1991) report that one expert and threenaive judges agree on an average of 83% of themoves classified in two map task dialogues.
Sixgames appear in the dialogues: Instruction, Con-firmation, Question-YN, Question-W, Explana-tion, and Alignment.
They are initiated bythe following moves: INSTRUCT (Provides in-struction), CHECK (Elicits confirmation of knowninformation), QUERY-YN (Asks yes-no questionfor unknown information), QUERY-W (Asks con-tent, wh-, question for unknown information), EX-PLAIN (Gives unelicited escription), and ALIGN(Checks alignment of position in task).Six other moves provide response and addi-tional feedback: CLARIFY (Clarifies or rephrasesgiven information), REPLY-Y (Responds affirma-tively), REPLY-N (Responds negatively), REPLY-W (Responds with requested information), AC-KNOWLEDGE (Acknowledges and requests con-tinuation), and READY (Indicates intention to be-gin a new game).Since the map task involves instructing oneplayer on how to draw a path, the conversationnaturally consists of many Instruction games.
Thestructure of games allows for nesting of games andlooping of response and feedback moves withingames ~The prototypical game consists of two or threemoves: Initiation, Response, and optionally Feed-back.
The large majority of games (84% from asample of 3 dialogues, n = 65) match the simpleprototype.
Games that do not match the proto-type are still well-formed, having extra response-feedback loops, nested games, or extra moves.Very few games (less than 2%) break down as aresult of a misunderstanding or other problem.Here is an example of a prototypical Instruc-tion game.
The vertical bar indicates the bound-ary of a move:A: Right,\[\[ just draw round it.READY I\[ INSTRUCTB: Okay.ACKNOWLEDGE2As a comparison with Clark and Schaefer (1987)embedded games often coincide with instances of em-bedded contributions in the acceptance phase.Conversational game structure, offers a taxon-omy which specifies both the function and contextof an utterance, as move z within game y. Thisfacilitates the study of the function of intonationaltune, since the tune reflects an utterance's conver-sational role.In tonat ion  in GamesUsing data from map task dialogues (Anderson etat., 1091), I have been analyzing mono- and di-syllabic words which compose single moves withinthemselves: right, okay, yes, no, mmhmm, and nh-huh.
In addition, I am categorizing the cases wherethese words form part of a move.
They typicallysurface as 5 of the 12 moves in the games anal-ysis (Kowtko et at., 1991): READY, ACKNOWL-EDGE, ALIGN, REPLY-Y, and REPLY-N.
The cur-rent data set consists of 68 utterances spoken by3 of the 4 conversants in 2 dialogues.In order to compare my results with thoseof McLemore (1991) and Hockey (1991), I havetried to collapse moves and their contexts into thethree general categories: ACKNOWLEDGE movefollowing INSTRUCT serves to connect; READY,ACKNOWLEDGE (and other) moves which inter-rupt an INSTRUCT (i.e.
precede a continuedINSTRUCT move) continue; REPLY-Y, REPLY-N, ACKNOWLEDGE after EXPLAIN, and AC-KNOWLEDGE after a response move (specificallyelicited moves) segment.The data yield the following results s: 42%of rises (5 of 11) appear as connecting moves,30% of levels (13 of 44) as continuing moves,and 69% of falls (9 of 13) as segmenting moves.Only one category approaches a match to otherpublished results.
It is possible that my de-cisions of which moves collapse together wouldnot be corroborated and cause some of the dis-agreement.
It is also possible that dialectal vari-ation would account for some of the difference(The map task contains Scottish as opposed toAmerican English), but it would be folly to wavesuch a hand of dismissal.
These results reflectan intonation-based approach.
Information maybe lost in the process of collapsing various dis-course contexts into three intonational categories(McLemore, 1991) and then limiting discourse cat-egories to match those three existing intonationalcategories (Hockey, 1991).
Separate discourse cat-egories, in a discourse-based approach, should fa-cilitate clearer esults.When categorized according to move and dis-course context, the data begins to speak on its3p > .20 for each result, according to theKolmogorov-Smirnov One-sample Test, indicates ta-tistical non-significance.284own.
Granted, the numbers for each category arecurrently small and not statistically reliable, butsome trends are striking and suggest hat moredata will prove to yield interesting results.
For ex-ample, of 15 REPLY-Y/N moves, 12, or 80%, arelevels, the 3 others being falls in a single category,REPLY-Y after QUERY-YN.
All 4 cases of REPLY-Y after ALIGN are high levels, while REPLY-Y/Nafter QUERY-YN are mostly low levels (6 of 8).Work is progressing on other dialogues, amass-ing enough pitch trace data to allow clear patternsto emerge for each type of move in each game con-text.
The goal is, given a discourse context, to beable to predict an utterance's function or move,given the intonation, and, conversely, predict in-tonational tune, given the type of move.Re ferencesAnderson, Anne H., Miles Bader, Ellen G.
