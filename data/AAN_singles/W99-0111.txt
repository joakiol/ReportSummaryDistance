Reference-based Discourse Structure for Reference ResolutionHelen Seville and Allan RamsayCentre for Computational LinguisticsUMIST, PO Box 88, Manchester M60 IQD, England' heleng/allan@ccl, umist, ac.
ukAbst ractThe connection between discourse struc-ture and reference is well recognmed.
Inthe system of language understanding de-scribed, discourse structure is exploited forthe purposes of reference resolution andthen continu/ty of reference is exploited tobuild the discomle ~etructure for the pur-poses of subsequent reference resohtion.The role of discourse structure in derefer-encing, pronouns, other NPs, and temporalreferences i explored, as is the role of thesein constraining discourse structure.I In t roduct ion ,The role of discourse structure in reference resolu-tion, in particular pronoun and temporal referenceresolution, iswell recognised.
However both Rhetor-ical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988)and the intention-based approach to diacourse strut-ture associated with C~ntering Theory (GROSS andSidner, 1986) involve high-level reamning.
Such tea-sorting itself presupposes the availability of interpre-tations in which references have already been re-solved.
This rakes the question of the legitimacyof assuming such a discourse segmentation for thepurposes of reference resolution.
From a practicalpoint of view a number of questions arise.
Firstly,to what extent can We obtain the discourse structurewe need for reference resolution without recourse tosuch higher-level reasoning?
Secondly, having doneour reference resolution, what further higher-levelreasoning needs to be done if we are to adequatelycapture the meaning of the discourse, v Being able tolabel our discourse structure with discourse relationswill only be useful insofar as these relations have im-plications for language understanding.
Recognisingan e.~hnafion can be seen to contribute to our un-derstanding in concrete ways.
It allows us to infer,for instance, the fact that one event caused anothertogether with the fact that the first event precededthe  second.
Given that this information is implicitin the discourse, it is clear that our understandingwould be impaired without it.
With other discourserelations, however, the contribution to inference andso discourse understanding is le~ dear.We have implemented s unified approach to ref-erence resolution and discourse structure in the sys-tern of language understanding described in (Ram-say, 1999).
Having used the existing discourse struc-ture to remlve references in the utterance and an-chor it in the discourse, we then use informationabout continuity of reference to attach the new dis-course state generated by the utterance to the dis-course structure, or discourse tree.
Attachment isby means of a number of interchangeable attach-ment rules which we have used to explore how differ-ent referential cues contribute to discourse structure(Seville, 1999).
The kinds of r~er~tial informationwe use include: ~eme I (as this term is used by (Hal-l/day, 1985)), since this is what the dismurse at anyone point is about; reference ~/me ~, since sometimesdiscourse structure reflects the temporal structureof the events described; and pronommali~ation igeneral, since this recognisably contributes to theoverall coherence of the discourse.
There are furtherreferential cues we have yet to explore, including ad-verbiais like "Then" and "Before that" and bridgingdescriptions like those in the following examples:(1) John I /~  Shirley.
(2) H~ mo~er doesn't.
(I) The house was grand.
(2) The door was carved with gilded cherubs.2 Tim is ~ailar in many ways to the center.2Asain, this is ,;,,,;lax to the notion of tmpomi cen-ter (Kameyama, Pa~onean, and Poeslo, 1993), but withimportant differences; for instance, re\]crones time is aninstant, while the tempond ~ is an interval.900@O@000000000000000O0O000000@0000000O00000@0OOOOOOOOOOOOO@@OOOOO@OOOO@O0OOO@OOOOO@OOOOOOThe way we evaluate the discourse trees generatedby the different attachment rules is with respect otwo main criteria.
The first of these is pronominal-isation.
An adequate discourse structure should en-able us to do long-distance pronominalisation, and,equally, prevent us from obtaining an antecedent inthose cases where the referent would normally notbe pronominalised; for example:- (1) Maryi loves Bill.
(2) He loves John.
(3) John loves Peter.?
(4) Peter loves her~.
'"Our second Criterion is discourse relations.
Whilethe discourse trees we generate for reference reso-lution are un\]abelled, we require that they get theattachments or d/sceurse 0wesd right, so that, in in-ferring how events are related, we consider only thoseevents which are actually connected in the discourse.Below, we describe our approach to reference res-olution and discourse structure building.
In the caseof reference resolution we are concerned with a widerange of referring expressions, including anaphors,pronouns, referential auxiliaries like "had", namesand definite descriptions (Seville and Ramsay, 1999).Of particular concern is the relationship betweenshort, non-unique NPs like "the man" and both pro-nouns like "he ~ and longer NPs like "the man in themoon"- Given that both pronouns and short NPslike "the man" are used to refer to familiar refer-ents, in context, an obvious trategy is to exploitthe discourse structure we have available to us forthe resolution of the latter ks well as the former.However, short NPs may be used to refer to enti-ties for which a pronominal reference is no longeravailable:(1) Mary loves Bil l .
(2) He loves John.
(3) John loves Peter.
(4) Peter loves Mary/,he~.This suggests a functional division between pro-nouns and names/definite d scriptions, with the for-met, but not the latter, relying on the discoursestructure for reference resolution.
Full NPs can, ofcourse, also be used to refer to entities which arepronominalisable, in the appropriate circumstances:(1) John~ loved Bill~.
(1) John~ loved B'dl.
(2) He~ adored hires.
(2) Bill adored hin~.Given that we are not treating defmite descriptionsas dependent on the discourse structure for their ref-erence, we still have to consider how a short NP like"the man" may successfully refer when there are ap-parently several potential referents in the context:"Alex~ was the man~ conducting the inter-views.
He~ arrived on time but couldn'tfind the entrance.
A manj showed him/the way and he~ settled into his office justin time for the first candidate.
A mantwalked into the room.
Alex~ asked himtto sit down.
TAe mant pulled out a gun.Alex~ recognised that her was the rnanjwho had given hin~ directions.
"2 Reference Resolut ionFor each utterance input to the system of languageunderstanding, we obtain a logical representation;for example, the following is the representation b-tained for "John loved Mary":3.4 :{ref(lB(speech.time(B))) > A}3C :{a~a(sbnple, A, C)}O( C, =ge.~, .el( ~D(.=~d( U,Job.
))))kt~(C,  evenz)~o( c, objea, .e /( ~E( .~d(  ~, ~=~))))All referring expressions are represented in this asterms of the form ref(AzP=).
Temporal expres-sions, or tense, also give rise to such terms.
Weuse the inference ngine described in (Ramsay, 1995;Cryan and Ramsay, 1997) to anchor the utterancein the common ground and update the commonground with its entailments.
Before our representa-tion is input to the theorem prover, it is converted toSkolemi-~ed normal form and then to sequent form.0 ==> \[,'el(2A(sp~e~h.~i,~(A))) > #72\]0 ==> \[=n,~a(~,~VZe, #72, #71)\]O ==>{e(#71, ~g~,,t,,.e/(>~(,~,~d(A, Job-))))\]0 ==> \[t~e(#n)\]0 ==> {t~(#n, e,,~)l0 ==> \[e(#71, objea,,.e/(>.A(w~d(.4, a~))))\]The order of the terms refO, B(named(B, John))))and re.f(AB(named(B, Ma~ll)))) in these retainsthe ordering of "John" and =Mar~ in the utter-ance, and this is the order in which the terms willbe dereferenced.
Retaining the order of referringexpressions i obvions\]y important for dealing withexamples like "John loves h lm~. '
,  but alto for de-ter~inlng the relative salience of referents for thedereferencing of subsequent pronominals.In anchoring referring expressions, we treat eachreference term as carrying with it an invitation tocarry out an existence proof in the common ground.The nature of the proof is retie~ted in the propertieso f  the reference term.
Names and definite descrip-tions have no special properties, as they don't bringwith them specific instructions as to where the ref-erent is to be located in the discourse structure.
We91discuss how we deal with these below.
Anaphors arecharacterised as salient and pronouns as centred, inthe current discourse state (e.g., 4):.
"himself" re/(~X(salient(Xo 4)&: re (X) ) )"him" re.f(AX(cerdred(X, 4)~m(X)))In order to dereference these terms, we need toconsider the discourse structure.
In the case ofanaphors0 we consider the referents already men-tioned in the new discourse state being constructedfor the utterance currently being processed.
In thecase of pronouns, we consider all open nodes in thediscourse tree we have constructed so far, i.e.
thoseon its right-hand frontier:0I1 Mentioned: (1, #72, #71, #46, #47) ?/ \2 3 Mentioned: (3, #72, #76, #75, #47, #46) "(I) John loved May.
(2) He had hated her.
(3) She had hated him.Each of these nodes represents a discourse state cor-responding to an utterance and has assodated withit the list of referents mentioned in that utterance.These include, for example, in the case of "She hadhated him": 3, the speech t/me; #72, the referencetime; #76, the event time; #75, the event itself;#47, Mary; and #46, John.
As well as pronouns,temporal references are dereferenced ~ the opennodes in the discourse structure, as detailed below.2.1 .AnaphorsAs stated above, we characterise the referents ofanaphors as salient.
This means that we must findtheir referents in the current discourse state.
Theother constraint we place on anaphors is that theirreferents play the role of arfumenf& This rules outcases  l i~e-  .?
"Mary~ took John with/~rsei/i.
"While anapher esolution is not dependent on dis--course structure, we discuss it briefly here mainlyfor the purposes of comparison with pronoun resolu-tion, which is heavily dependent on discourse strut-ture.
Consider the following example:(1) John~ loves Bill i.
(2) He~ adores him~.~.In dereferencing "himeeli ~in (2), the reference termto be considered is re/(AB(salient(B, 2)&re(B)))).In dereferencing this we consider, in the order inwhich they were mentioned and dealt with by theinference engine, the entities already added to thecurrent discourse state:\[2,#ts,#4o\]These are speech time (2), the event itself (#78),and John (#46).
Of these, we can prove that #46satisfies the property m, which we use to representmale gender.
It also meets the constraint of beingan argument, so our reference term is dereferencedto it.2.2 PronounsIn the case of pronouns we consider two cases, thatwhere the referent functions as an argument and thatwhere it doesn'L In the following case, "him" playsthe role of argument:(1) Jo l~ loves Bill~.
(2) He~ adores himj.What this means is that, in order to ensure thatthe constraint of dbjoint reference (i.e., betweenpronouns and the antecedents of anaphors) is met,we must start our search for the centred referentof,ef(AB(centred(B, 2)&re(B))) not in the currentdiscourse state, but in the previous discourse state,represented by the lowermmt open node in the dis-course tree.
E}imlnating from consideration any ofits referents which are also current entities, i.e., #46,this leaves us with:\[I,#80,#38\]These entities are, respectively, speech time, theevent, and Bill.
All of these are considered, in order,and we find that #38, i.e., Bill, matches the referringexpression.
":-In the following example, "her TM does not re-fer to an argument, and we must begin thesearch for the referent of the corresponding terml'ey(AB(cenh'ed(B, 1)&f(B)))) not in the previous,but the current discourse state:(1) Maw~ took John with her~.Here, the t~ferents mentioned so far include:\[1, #82, #81, #47, #4elofthese, we can prove that #47, i.e., Mary, satisfiesthe property jr, for female gender, and m our termis sueeeeefully dereferenced to this.
We deal withthe following cataphoric example in exactly the sameway:%Vith heft Maryi took John.
"Because we treat "With her" as an instance of leftextrapmition, we get e~Actly the same logical formfor this utterance as for that above.
It is this whichdetermines the order in which referring expressions9200@000000000000000000O0O000O00000000000000@0OOOOOOOOOOOOO@OOOOOOOOOO@OOOOOOOOOOOO@OOOO@are dereferenced andso, in this case, as in thatabove, "Mary" is dereferenced before, and so pro-vides the antecedent for, "her "s.Where we fail to find an antecedent for a pronounin the previous discourse state, our search considersthe next open node in the discourse tree.
This isnot necessarily the immediately previous discoursestate, as illustrated by the following example4:0I1/ \2 3/ I45(1) a man died in a park.
(2) he had been sleeping there.
(3) awoman loved him.
(4) she had hated him.
(5) he had hated himself.Here (3) is the next open node to be considered after(5), since (4) was closed by the attachment of thelatter.
It is in the list of referents mentioned in (3)that we are able to find the referent of "her" giventhe following ~ntinuation:(6) he had loved her.2.3 Reference TimesFor the purposes of reference r solution, we treat ref-erential tenses imilarly to pronouns.
As an exam-ple, consider utterance (5) above.
The logical formwe obtain corresponding to th~ is ss follows:3,4 :{,el(~B(c~red(B, 5)krel(ACs~echJir~(C))) > B) > A}~D :{~c?
(p~/ecCive, A, D)}e(U, .e~,  rsl(~E(~en~red(~, 5)km(~))))~(V,  ~)~(D, ~ie=, ,e1(~(=a~(F, 5)~(F))))This =contains a reference to a centred time beforespeech time:,'e l(  AC( ,~ , -~, ,~(  c) ) ) > B) )~The~z s~re fiuther cases of cataphors which we don'tattempt to deal with here.
These differ from the shove inthat the~ is no \]eft extrapomtion f p~onoun~ont~iningconstituests.
Instead, the pronomin~dised items aremarked as nero by being ~-eued, which is what distin.guisha them from unmarked, anaphoric uses (Hdlidayand Huan, 1976); for ~*m_ple:"THIS is wh~t worries me:I c~'t get ~y xeli,ble INFORMATION.
"Dealing with such examples seems to require & theory offocus, and so ;- beyond the scope ofthi~ paper.~This w~- built m/ng the cue of pronom;n~lisation.as described in the following section.When we are anchoring (5), the open nodes in thediscourse tree are (4), (3), and (1).
The entitiesmentioned in discourse state (4), the first open nodeto be considered, are as follows:\[4, #478, #480, #479, #476, #477\]These correspond to speech time, the reference time(i.e., the event ime of (3)), the event ime, the eventitself, the woman, and the man.
Our temporal ref-?
erence term is dereferenced tothe first centred timewhich we can prove is before speech time s. This is .
.
.
.not #480, the time of (4)'s event, but #478, the timeof (3)'s event, which precedes it in the list of entitiesmentioned in (4).
As will be apparent below; thischoice of reference time has important implicationsfor the discourse structure we build.2.4 Names and Definite DescriptionsThere are no reliable surface cues for distinguishingshort, non-unique NPs used to refer to familiar ef-erents and longer NPs which may denote simply byvirtue of their meaning.
We therefore need a uni-fied approach to dereferencing the reference termswe obtain for both.
As mentioned above, these areall of the form, re1(A-Pz), but, unlike in the caseof anaphors and pronouns, incorporate no propertiescharacter/sing where in the discourse structure theirreferents are to be found:"the man" reJ~O~Y(man(X)))In finding our referent we have no recourse to dy-namie properties of entities like salient and centre~but only static properties like man.
However, we stillneed to distinguish more and less prominent poten,tisl referents d a short NP like "the man'.
Theway in which we do th~ is to co~der entities men-tioned in the discourse in order of recency.
Givena referring expression containing a property such asAX(man(X)), we prove that there is an entity sat-~/ying the proper~y.
In this way we obtain eitheran entity which has been explicitly mentioned or, inthe case of bridging descriptions, one associated withsuch an entity but which has not itself been expl/c-itly mentioned.
In the cue of a bridging description,we obtain the proof via a meaning postulate, suchas the following:vX(ho~,e(x) => ~Y(ol(r, Az(~(z)),  x)))Due to the ordering of facts and meaning postulatesin the database, we tend to obtain the most recentlymentioned entity or, in the case of bddg/ng descrip-tions, that with the most recent antecedent, first.The following example serves to illustrate:awe ignore previous peech times from the point ofview of subsequent de~ferencing.93(I) Shirley arrived at the house~.
(2) John opened the door/( 0.In resolving the reference to "the door", we oh-tain a proof that the entity #88(#123) satisfies thisproperty.
Although this entity has not previouslybeen mentioned, the house s , #123, has been recentlymentioned, and it is this, together with the meaningpostulate above, which forms the basis of our proof.In order to recognise cases of ambiguity, ratherthan simply find the single most recent entity satisfy-ing the referring expression, we simultaneously findall entities atisfying the property which are equallyrecent.
(I) The cart arrived at the housej.
(2) John opened the door/(~/j).Our default criterion of equal recency is having beenmentioned, orhaving an antecedent, within the samediscourse state.
This means that we recognise theambiguity in the example above.
However, giventhis criterion, we do not detect any ambiguity in thefollowing exampleT:(I) Shirley got in the cari.
(1) She arrived at the housej.
(2) John opened the door/0 ).. Where no entity of the kind has been mentioned, ourreference resolution procedure is exactly the same,with all potential referents being considered equallyrecent.
We will obtain a unique referent in this casegiven a definite description, like ~the )Yr~ man onthe moon", which denotes uch a referent by virtueof its meaning.Because the referents of NPs needn't have beenmentioned and don't have to satisfy the property'!
: ?centred, we are able to obtain referents for namesand definite descriptions in cases where a pronomi-nal reference would have failed.
However, the reversesituation is also poaible~ In the following example,"it" dearly picks out the red car, whereas "the car'doesn't seem an appropriate way of referring to it.
(1) Mary drive, a red carl.eThis was also a fizst mention.
In this case.
the ref-erent .was accommodated.TThis scc--m approps~te in th/s cue:(I) Shirley Sot in the cart.
(1) She arzived at the housej.
(2a) John opened the doorj(#) to let herin.?
(2b) John opened the door;( 0 to let her out..However, in other cases, it does seem that we need toconsider entities other than those w~thin the same dis-course state to be equally, recent.
Discourse structuremay be a factor, and this is something we may be ableto capture.
However, other factors which are harder totrack, like discourse topic, also seem to be involved.
(2) She hates iti/the car~.Our explanation of this is that, in the same waythat we must use an anaphor rather than s pro-noun when an anaphor is available (i.e., for argu-ments within the same clause), there is a conventionwhereby we normally use a pronoun rather than adefinite description when this option is open to us a .It is possible to use a full definite description in suchcircumstances, but there should be a reason for sucha choice of referring expression, Of which discoursestructure is the obvious candidate, since this maywell be affected in such a case, as we will show below;We define normal use as follows.
A pronoun shouldbe used to realise any entity mentioned in the pred-ous discourse state, except in those cases where thisentity is being promoted over a more salient referentwith the same pronominal properties.
According tothis definition, "Bill" in (2) below is a normal use ofa full NP, since "He" would have been dereferencedto John, over whom Bill is being promoted.
(1) John loves Bill.
(I) John loves Mary.
(2) Bill loves him.
?
(2) Mary loves him.However, the use of "Mary ~ is regarded as excep-tional.
As such, it is likely to be interpreted as con-veying some implicature (Orice, 1975).
Given someassociated discourse move (i.e., a further conventionassociated with the exception), the use of "Mary"can be regarded as felic'ito~ (Austin, 1962).
How-ever, in the absence of any reason for the exceptionalchoice of referring expr_~__m_'on, it may be regarded asiafelicitous.
While we have not associated any dis-course moves with the use of definite descriptions, wedo find such moves eme~hg in the work describedbelow.
This happens because we treat pronouns, butnot names and definite descriptions, as anchored tosome particular discourse state, and this is one kindof information used in building the subsequent dis-course structure.3 Building the Discourse StructureOnce we have anchored an utterance and created anew discourse state corresponding toit, we-use infor-mation about continuity of reference to attach it tothe existing discourse tree.
Since there are a varietyof referential cues and ways of using (and combining)them to be considered, this attachment informationis represented in a variety of interchangeable rules.The referential cues explored so far include:8This is not merely an orb/tm~ convention.
The useof a pronoun assures us that we are continuing to talkabout he same referent in circumstances where a nameor definite description might signal a change of referent.9400000000000@0000000000000000000000000000OQOOOOOOOOOOOO@OOOOe@OOeOOOOO@OOOOOOOOOOOOOO?
the theme?
the reference time (where applicable)?
all pronouns (including reference time)In choosing a discourse state to which to attach thecurrent discourse state, we may specify, for instance:?
one that shares its theme?
one to which any pronouns that it contains canbe dereferenced?
the lowest suitable utterance in the tree?
the highest suitable utteranceFurthermore, attachment may be:?
as a daughter, thereby keeping the attachmentutterance open?
as ashter, resulting in its closureHere, we briefly consider how useful the differentref~entiel cues seem to be, by comparing the resultsof some of the more succesdul attachment rules.3.1 ThemeThe tree below was constructed using a very sim-ple attachment rule whereby a discourse state whichcontinued the existing theme was attached to its pre-deeeuor as a sister, while one which changed thetheme was instead attached as a daughter s.0/I - -2/3----4/(1) a man died in a park.
(2) he had been sleeping there.
(3) a woman loved him.
(4) she had hated him.
(5) he had hated hin~Jf.
(6) he had loved her.Of the rules we considered which ut'dised theme, thisone was relatively suer~seful, support i~ the long-distance reference to "he~' in (6).
It can be seenthat this is because the open nodes in the tree serveto keep track of any previous themes.
However,theme, taken by itself, does not seem to provide agood guide to discourse structure.
The discoursestructure We obtain h~re is, in elect, linear.
Alter-native theme-based attachment rules did result in~We distinguish between dize~ly attaching a2 as asister of al and attaching it as a daughter of*ts's mother.In both cases nl would no longer be open either fordereferencing pronouns or as an attachment site for fu-ture nodes.
The difference becomes apparent when westart labellinlg the tree with discourse relations, amatterwhich iJ not discussed in the current paper.more interesting structures.
For instance, (5) couldbe treated as resuming the theme of (2), and so at-tached there; however, in this case the reference to"her" in (6) would fail due to the closure of nodes(3) and (4).
A further alternative involves treat-ing smooth transitions from mention in the rhemeto mention as theme as cases of thematic ontinuity(Hahn and Strube, 1997).
We found this approach toresult in some trees which were useful for pronounresolution but which, again, didn't seem to reflectthe discourse structure.3.2 Reference T imeWe illustrate the cue of reference time using the sameexample as above.
In this case, attachment of a dis-course state with a referential tense was to the dis-course state which tint introduced the time referredto.0 (I) a man died in a park./ \ (2) he had been sleeping there.1 3 (3) a woman loved him.i / I \ (4) she had hated him.2 4 5 6 (5) he had hated himself.
(6) he had loved her.Again, as in the case above, we are able to managethe reference to "her" in (6).
There is a difl~erence inthis case, however, in that we anchor the ref~.rringexpression to (3) in this case but to (4) above.
At-guably this tree, which has fewer open nodes, does abetter job of retaining just that information which isneeded for pronoun resolution.
What it clearly doesbetter, however, is represent aspects of the discoursestructure like the dependency of (2)on (1) and theparallelism of (4), (5), and (6).
It can be seen todo this insofar as the temporal structure reflects thedismune structure.
Where it is unsuccessful is incapturing that (3) is a continuation of (1), but thenthis is unsurprising since the simple past tense of (3)is existential rather than referential I?.3.3 Pronomlnalbmt ionThe mndts we obtain using the cue of ~ference timealone can be enhanced either by considering themetogether with reference time or by.
considering allpronomie~t;~-d items, which we take to include ref-erence time.
The problematic attachment of (3)above is not helped by considering its theme, sincethis is, like its tense, .existential rather than referen-tial.
However, if we use a pronominal/sation-basedrule, whereby we attach a new discourse state as adaughter of the highest open node at which all itss?It refers only to the current speech time.95pronouns can be dereferenced, then we obtain thefollowing tree.0I1'/ \2 3../1\456(1) a man died in a park.
(2) he had been sleeping there.
(3) a woman loved him.
(4) she had hated him.
(5) he had hated himself.
(6) he had loved her.By considering all pronouns, we realise that (3)should not be attached higher than (1), where thereferent of "him" was introduced.
It is arguable thatthe attachment of (3) to (I) should have been as asister rather than a daughter, thereby closing (I) tofuture pronoun resolution and attachment, but thisis a distinction which is hard to capture.4 Discuss ionBy experimenting with a variety of interchangeableattachment rules we have found that, at least inthose cases where it is available, temporal referenceprovides a reliable constrmnt on discourse struc-ture.
Where it is not available, tree-building can beguided by other cues such as continuity of theme andpronominal/sation.
However, nnllke reference time,these are heuristics rather than constraints and insome crees can be unreliable.
In the first examplebelow, the theme, aShe', of (3) seems to cue at-tachmdnt to (I), where this referring expr ~,~on isanchored, but (3) is, rather, an elaboration of (2).In the second example, 0 )  is a continuation of (I)even though its theme, aHe n, triers to John who wasnot even mentioned anti\] discourse state (2).
(1) Sam arrived at Hmmal~'s house.
(2) He had lost the key.
(3) She~ would be annoyed with him.
(I) Mary ran.?
(2) 3ob~ had seen her.
(3) H~ ~ her.While reference time is of i/mited appficabi\]ity, wedo not regard this u a problem since we can recog-uise precisely those cases in which it is applicable.There is one other kind of cue which we have foundto be useful, and a~ain this only applies to a particu-lar set of cases.
This is the use ors full NP to refer toan already familiar eferent, particularly the currenttheme, when, for the purposes of reference resolu-tion, a pronominal reference would be perfectly ad-equate.
While this is not a cue we explicitly set outto investigate, interestingly different discourse struc-tures emerged from certain of the attachment rulesspecified, depending upon whether or not referenceswere made pronominally.
Compare the following dis-course structures, both constructed using the cueof pronominalization, as outlined above.
The first,with its pronominal references, can be regarded asan elaboratzon, but, if continuity is regarded ~ a pre-requisite of this relation, then the second cannot Ix.0I 0x / \I 122(1) Mary, loves John.
(1) Mary loves John.
(2) She~ adores him.
(2) Mary adores John.This is not s result we set out to achieve.
It emergedas a result of our different approaches to referenceresolution for pronouns and full NPs.
Recall thatthe former but not the latter are regarded as an-chored within the discourse structure, thus providingus with potential attachment cues.
In constructingthe first of the trees above, the anchoring of the pro-nouns in (2) to discourse state (I) provides the basisfor the attachment made.
There are no alternativerules for full NPs in the second example, however;rather, attachment simply fails to be made to (1)becanse there is no evidence of a discourse connec-tion.The di~erent discourse structures we obtain givenpronomlnal and non-pronominal zeferences to the?
same thematic entity suggest he importance of thechoice of referring expression to discourse structure.One of our goals is to use referring expressions torecognise the discourse moves associated with them.The following examples serve to illustrate:(1) Sam/arrived at the house.
(2) He~ had lost the key.
(3) He~/Sann rang the bell.
(1) San~ arrived at the house.
(2) He~ had lost the key.
(3) He~/?Sam?
dropped it.In the first of these, "Sam" in (3) seems to be s fe-licitous choice of referr i~ expression.

contrastive one, as in:(1) Mary Io,= ~o~.
(2) Jue adores hi,.,The discourse structure we set when the (ull NP "Mary"is used is one assoc~ted with such s d i sco~,  relation.However, these rel~tiou are inappropriate in this case.Rather than attempt to label the tree resulting from theuse of "Mary', we would prefer to resard this choice ofreferring expression as infelicitous.96@00@000O@@000OO0@0@O00@000O0O00000@00@0O$OOO0OO@OOOO@gO0OOO0@@OO0OOof (2).
In the second example, however, "Sam" doesnot seem to be available as a choice of referring ex-pression.
Again this makes sense insofar as (3) ishere a continuation of (2).
The cue of pronominal-ization seems to indicate continuity.
Where it couldhave been used but isn't, the deliberate choice of analternative referring expression serves to traplicate(Grice, 1975) the absence of continuity.
However,our rules as currently implemented don't really cap-ture this explanation.
Given a non-pronominal ref-erence to the current heme, there may well be a lackof evidence of continuity, so we avoid the attachmentof (3) to (2), but we may also fail to attach (3) to (I)!One way of dea/ing with such cases would be to in-troduce anew kind of attachment rule.
All the rulesexplored so far rely on choceing a preferred nodefor attachment.
These cases might be better dealtwith by negative constraints on attachment.
Givena default attachment of(3) to (2) z~, this attachmentwill be prevented in these cases where (3)'s theme isnot pronominalised (but could have been), therebyresulting in the alternative attachment of (3) to (I).Having identified two kinds of referential cueswhich seem to provide useful guides to discoursestructure in particular eases, it is worth consideringwhat problems remain with these.
Firstly, we con-sider temporal reference as a cue to d/scourse struc-ture.
We have argued that this provides a relativelyreliable constraint.
However, this assumes that weresolve our temporal references appropriately in thefirst place.3 (3) a woman loved him./ \ (4) she had hated him..4 5 ~ (5) he had hated himself.In this fragnent from the discourse used above, weattach (5) to (3) only becausewe first dereferencedits reference time to the event time of (3).
Nowconsider the alternative continuation:(5) he had beaten her for years.In this case, we would also attach (5) to (3) be-cause again its r~erence time would be preferentiallydereferenced to the event ime of (3)aS, rather thanthat of (4), but in this case we get it wrong.
Themistake is not necessarily one which is irrecoverable.If there were no sensible discourse relation to be in-ferred between (5,) and (3), as in this case, then themistake could be recognised and both the temporalreference and the attachment revised.
However, thisZ2By this we mean only that con~deration f(2) as apotential attachment ode precede, con~deration f(1)."
13A similar preference would be made by other ap-proaches such as Tempora/Centering (Kameyama, Pus-sons,u, and Poesio0 1993).example does serve to illustrate the problems with ineffect using temporal structure m a cue to discoursestructure, when perhaps the two are better treatedas mutually constraznlng.In exploiting the distinction between pronominaland non-pronominal references to the current hemewe find a related, albeit less serious, problem to thatabove.
In order to exploit the choice of referringexpression in building discourse structure, we needto know that it is felicitous.
However, whether itis felicitous itself depends on the discourse struc-ture: Note that, in the examples discussed above,discourse states (I) and (2) taken together provideidentical contexts for the dereferencing of the refer-ring expressions "He/Sam" in (3).
The only differ-once is the discourse thread, which joins (3) to (I)in the first case, but to (2) in the second case.
Sincethis is not the kind of information we have availableto us when we are doing our reference resolution, wesimply haveto ~s*,me that the choice of referringexpression is felicitous.
However, this assumptioncould be retracted were we to fail to label the dis-course structure constructed.
In this example, "Samarrived at the house .. .Sam dropped it \[the key\].
"can be rejected ass narrative sequence, because Samcan't drop the key he has lost x4.5 Fur ther  Work  ?R~erential continuity is a complex phenomenon,and in considering the impact of reference on dis-course structure there are many more examples ofreference to be considered than those d i so ,~d here.These include referential adverbials which, as anadditional source of temporal reference to tense,can be expected to further constrain the discoursestructure.
Some examples of these are discmmed in(Seville, 199g).
Another important category of refer-ential expressions are bridging descriptions.
Whilepronominali~tion is a key indicator of referentialcontinuity where it is available, where it is not,brid~Ong descriptions seem to provide a similar de-gree of referential continuity:(I) The hous~ was grand.
(2a) Ik was in the baroque style.
(2b) The door/( 0 was carved with ~lded cherubs.s4Similazly, "he had beaten her for years" would berejected as a potential ezplanat/on of "a woman lovedhim" in the example above, and, to return to a previousexample:?
(1) Mary loves John.
(2) Mary adore, b;m~could not be labelled as a coast ,  u. no elementof contrast can be identified.97Integrating bridging descriptions into our treatmentof reference resolution was straightforward, becauseof the way in which the terms they refer to are der-vived, via meaning postulates, from terms represent-ing existing referents.
For the same reason, recog-nising and exploiting this kind of referential continu-ity to build discourse structure should be relativelystraightforward.6 ConclusionWe have described aunified approach to referenceresolution and discourse structure which is imple-mented in a system of language understanding.
Aswell as exploiting discourse structure for referenceresolution, we explore the extent o which referen-tial information can in turn be exploited to providethe discourse structure to be used by subsequentreference resolution.
The strengths and weaknessesof the different referential cues investigated have al-ready been discussed in the previous ection.
Herewe highlight some of the other issues raised.What, if any, is the role of discourse structurein the dereferencing of short, non-unique Nl~s re-ferring to familiar eferents?
We have argued thatthe differences between the felicity conditions forthe use of pronouns and non-pronominalised NPssuggest that the former are dependent on discoursestructure but the latter are not.
This has furtherimplications for our account in that it means wein turn exploit pronominalised references, but notnon-pronominalised r ferences, in building discoursestructure.
The different Uses of pronouns and non-pronominalised NPs have also been noted by (Hitse-man and Poesio, 1995), although with a view to ref-erence generation.While space precludes a full diso,_~_'on of theirapproach, it is worth wmmark i~ the diffe~nce be-tween their approach and ours here.
They assumethat discourse structm~ is used for the resolution ofall referring expreui'ons, but that, while pronounscan only refcr to an entity which w~ at one pointthe Most Salient gntity ~s in the discourse, definitedescriptions can refer to any entity on  the discoursestack.
We assume that Mu~ structure is usedonly for the resolution of pmnominalised re fen~expressions.
Related to this, we exploit he fact thatitems which c~n-be pronomlnalised normally show/dbe, in order to impose further structure on the dis-course.
If a short NP is used where a pronoun wouldhave been interpretable, we assume that the currentutterance should not be attached, either as a daugh-ter or a sister, to the most recent node.
Failing tossThis notion k closely rdated to that d the center.take advantage of an attachment clue, such as theuse of pronominalisation f theme, is seen a positiveinstruction ot to attach at a certain point, ratherthan just as a lack of information.Our observation ofthe effects of the choice of refer-ring expression, whether pronominalised or not, ondiscourse structure raised a number of issues whichneed to be explored further.
The first of these isthe need to make a distinction between the effectsof reyeren~s and re/er~ng ezpressions on discoursestructure, since the choice of a different referring ex-pression for the same referent may convey a differentdiscourse move.
Closely related to this, there is theneed to consider how referential continuity may beindicated where pronominalisation is not an option,as, for instance, by the use of bridging descriptionslinking non-identical but closely related referents.Finally there is the need to consider whether attach-ment choices may be better explained in terms ofnegative constraints on attachment rather than (orin addition to) the attachment preferences we haveassumed here.A further observation we made was that discoursestructure constrains temporal structure, and so tem-poral reference, in the same way that temporal struc-ture constrains discourse structure.
While referencetime may provide us with a reliable cue to discoursestructure, if our preferred reference time turns outto be wrong then we also get the discourse structurewrong.
Similarly, if we had operated attachmentpreferences before reference resolution, the conversewould have held.
Either way, we are faced with thedilemma that it is not until we.have bo~ a poten-tial set of referents and a potential attachment sitethat inference can be used to determ;ne whether anyplausible discourse relations hold giveh the choiceswe have made.ReferencesAustin, J. L. 1962.
