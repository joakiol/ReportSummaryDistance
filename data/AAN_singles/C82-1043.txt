Attention is focused on construction of ~he in-ternal expressions of Japanese sentences based on case struc-tures of predicates and also conversion of the Japanese in-ternal expressions to the English ones for generating good Eng-lish sentences in conventional use.
Finally, associated withtranslation, extraction of specified translated informationfrom Japanese patent claim sentences is described briefly.i.
CASE STRUCTURES AND PARSINGIn every Japanese sentence a predicate such as the main verb is located at theend of the sentence and takes a part of the governor of the preceding dependants asfollows:tl Jl t2 J2 .

tn 3n P "In the above t. (i=1,2~.-.,n) denotes a term depending on the predicate p andj.
denotes a pos~posltlon or a ease suffix such as "Kakujoshi" and other aux- .
1 ll!ary words.Japanese is an allutinative language?
A postposition j. of a term t. clari- l lies the syntactic role of the term t. in a sentence governed by the mai~ verb.?
.
l Conversely, a set of these postposltlons or syntactic case labels determines thesyntactic function of the main verb in a sentence and is called a verb pattern.The verb pattern plays an important role to identify the syntactic structures ofsentences in Japanese like Hornby's verb patterns in English?From a semantic view point, Japanese predicates are classified to about 20main categories and case structures are defined based on the verb categories andthe verb patterns.
The case labels and the categorical names used here are chosenthe same as those of English case structures in the previous paper \[2\].Table 1 shows case frames constructed on the verb pattern VP9 of a verb whichtakes syntactic cases of SUBJect, OBJect and DATIVE accompanied with representa-tive postpositions "ga", "wo" and "hi" respectively.Table 2 shows an instance of description of a verb in the word dictionary con-structed on the case frame basis.
The first and second columns show the names ofverb patterns and semantic main categories taken bythe  verb respectively.
Theygive the token of the case frame of the verb.
The third and forth columns showthe equivalents of the verb and the names bf  their Hornby's verb patterns.
Ifthere are some equivalents in a row of categories, some key tokens such as pairsof a ease-label and a subcategory taken by their dependants are added in orderthat a better equivalent can be chosen.The next example shows some Japanese sentences which have the main verb illus-trated in Table 2, the internal expressions and the corresponding English sentences, where the postpositions in Japanese sentences are enclosed with parentheses, andthe symbol " * " in the internal expressions denotes the term which is in front ofthe f~ame including the s~r~ol.271272 F.

First, all the words involved ina sentence are retrieved from the di~tlonary.
Then all the possible parsingsunder respective frame conditions are carried out in parallel from the left of thesentence.
The case labels of dependants are determined by referring to the syn-tactic and semantie categories of the dependants and the case frame of thegovernor.The internal expressions sometimes lack the agent ease or the object case cor-responding to the original Japanese sentence.
When the internal form has a pred-icate affecting on some objects and lacks the agent in the active voice, it isexpanded into an English sentence in the passive voice.
When the main predicatebelongs to category of state such as existence and attribute and lacks the objectcase, an appropriate pronoun to the context such as "it", "we" or "they" is sub-stituted for the thematized object case as the general environment or the generalexperlencer.Japanese noun words are not obliged to have articles which give a measure ofdefiniteness to an object indicated by a noun word.
Since English noun words takedeterminers such as articles obligatorily in many cases, the articles must be re-stored from the context of the Japanese sentences in,construction of their inter-nal expressions.
The restoration is carried out in many cases by anaphorieanalysis and reference to information about the conventional use of articles de-scribed for every noun phrase in the word dictionary.JAPANESE-ENGLISH TRANSLATION THROUGH INTERNAL EXPRESSIONS 2732.
CASE CONVERSIONThe case structures of Japanese and English are partly different from eachother at the level of the internal expressions currently used.
Though constitu-ents of case structures such as categorical names and case labels are chosen thesame in both languages, there are different expressions due to logically possiblecombinations of a governor and the dependants for the same event or the sameaction, and the preferable combination depends on the individual language.On the other hand, it is desired that a thematic term is kept unchanged throughtranslation.
Syntactically the thematic term takes the front part of a sentencein both English and Japanese, and furthermore, takes the subject case in English.Hence if the internal expression obtained from a Japanese sentence does notsatisfy these conditions, some conversions are tried to yield a more suitableEnglish internal expression.
Some of them are shown in the following.2.1 Conversion of Existence and Attribute ExpressionAs well knoWn, Japanese is a BE language while English is a HAVE language.
InJapanese the possessive expression is almost confined to the case where a humanhas something in his hand, and the other possessive expressions in English aregenerally described in existence and attribute expressions.Example 2Let us consider the following sentences:(a) He has a daughter.
(b) Copper has high electric conductivity.They are usually expressed in Japanese as follows:he -(ni wa) a -(no) daughter -(ga) is(2) (PRED-EXIST: is, OBJ-HUM: a daughter, LOC-HUM: ~ )(3) With hi=~m is a daughter.
(b) (i) ~ ~ i~m ~ ~copper -(wa) electric conductivity -(ga) is high(2) (PRED-ATTR: is high, OBJ-PHYS.QUANT: electric conductivity,LOC-PHYS.OBJ: as for copper)(3) As for copper eiectric conductivity is high.In each illustration above, (i), (2) and (3) denote a Japanese sentence, theinternal expression with terms replaced with English equivalents and a literaltranslation obtained by rewriting the internal expression respectively.
The partwith a double underline denotes a thematic part in the source sentence.As seen from the above the literal translation does not preserve the thematicterm of the original Japanese sentence within the standard English sententialform.The translation with the thematic term unchanged requires replacement of themain predicate by HAVE verb and the accompanied case conversion as shown in Table3.
Rules 1 and 2 are conversion rules of Japanese EXISTence and ATTRibute expres-sions to English POSSessive expressions.Table 3 Case Conversion between BE and HAVE VerbsRule iRule 2Japanese (PRED-EXIST: be , OBJ-THINGS: tLOC-PHYS.OBJu PHYS.LOC: t 2 )i 'English (PRED-POSS: have , OBJ-THINGS: t I ,POSSESSOR~PHYS.OBJ u PHYS.

OBJ: t 2 )English (PRED-POSS: have , POSSESSOR-PHYS.OBJ: t_ ,OBJ-PHYS.QUANT: tI(PRED-ATTR: to , OB~: e ))Example 3274 F. NISHIDA and S. TAKAMATSUThe applications of the above rules to the internal expressions in Example 2yield the following expressions.
(a) (PRED-POSS: has, POSSESSOR-HUM: he, OBJ-HUM: a daughter)(b) (PRED-POSS: has, POSSESSOR-PHYS'OBJ: copper, OBJ-PMYS.QUANT: electricconduct~vlty(PRED-ATTR: be high, OBJ: e ))These intern&l expressions can be rewritten to the sentences (a) and (b) nearthe heading of Example 2.2.2 Conversion of State-Orlented ExpressionsJapanese is a state-oriented language and often takes a type of descriptionthat thing A changes to thing B owing to thing C in an event.
If C is anon-llving object, C is interpreted as a cause or an instrument rather than anagent from the standpoint of translation, and usually does not take the subjectcase even if C is emphasized.On the other hand, English is an action-oriented language and often uses ex upressions such that thing C makes thing A change to B even if the categoryof C is a non-living object.The following shows some conversion rules between the above expressions.Rule 3 (PRED: TA , OBJ: t~ MEANSuCAUSEUINSTR: ~I )~PRED.

SOME TRANSLATION RESULTSAlong the line described in the preceding sections, some experiments on trans-lation have been carried out in an interactive mode.
The average translation timeexcluding word retrieval and interaction is about 0.35 seconds per a Japaneseword?
Some experimental results are shown in this section, where names of catego-ries in the inter~al expressions are omitted for simplicity?Example 5(A) Input Japanese sentences(B) The internal expression(PRED:give~ VOICE:passive, OBJ:measuF(DET:indef, NUM:SIN~ular, CHAR:~I, OBJ:@ forc~(DET:indef, NUM:UnCountable, OBJ:~z)(PRED:exert ~, AG:flui~(DET:indef,:(PRED:compare, AG:__, OBJ:signal(DET:indef, NUM:UC, OBJ:~3), OBJ:~)) ,  MEANS .

EXTRACTION OF SPECIFIED TRANSLATED INFORMATIONBy using a method similar to the above case conversion, specified structuralinformation w~itTen in English can be extracted f~om Japanese Texts in parallelwith their translation.
Each specification Table fo~ information extraction usedhere consists of several case frames, and each case frame has a standard casestructure comresponding To a simple sentence or a phPase.
Table ~ is an-example276 F. NISHIDA and S. TAKAMATSUof specification tables used for patent claim sentences.Table 4 A Specification Table for Semiconductor DevicesCOMPOSITION:PROCESS:QUALITY:LOCATION:(OBJ-Devlce: t , COMFonent: t. )(PRED-ACT:_, OBJ-D: rut .
