Robust Speech Recognition TechnologyProgram SummaryPrincipal Investigators: Clifford J. Weinstein and Douglas B. PaulMIT Lincoln LaboratoryThe major objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate robust, high-performancecontinuous peech recognizer (CSR) techniques and systems focused on application in spoken lan-guage systems (SLS).
A key supporting objective is to develop techniques for integration of CSRand natural anguage processing (NLP) systems in SLS applications.
The CSR techniques arebased on a continuous-observation Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach, which has previouslydemonstrated high performance for normal speech and robustness for stressed speech.
The motiva-tion is that current state-of-the-art CSR systems must be improved in performance and robustnessfor advanced SLS environments, with variabilities including those due to spontaneous speech, noise,and task-induced stress.
The effort in CSR/NLP integration is focused on development of a struc-tured CSR/NLP interface, which will allow effective collaboration with and between other groupsdeveloping NLP and/or CSR systems.The Lincoln program began with a focus on improving speaker stress robustness for the fighteraircraft environment.
A robust HMM isolated-word recognition (IWR) system was developed with99% accuracy under stress conditions, representing more than an order-of-magnitude reduction inerror rate relative to a baseline HMM system.
A robust CSR system was then developed andintegrated into a voice-controlled flight simulator - -  a simple, but a complete SLS involving astressing, real-time task.
The robust HMM recognition system was then adapted and extendedto large vocabulary CSR.
This effort has included development of a number of new modellingand recognition techniques which have resulted in state-of-the-art performance for both speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) recognition on the DARPA Resource Management(RM) database.Recent accomplishments include: (1) development of tied mixture techniques using observationpruning, which when incorporated with other improvements into the HMM recognizer, have yieldedperformance for both SD and SI training which is equivalent to the best reported on the October1989 RM test set; (2) development and implementation, i  initial prototype form, of a structuredCSR/NLP interface including the required protocols, the stack decoder control structure, and initialCSR and NLP simulators to allow testing; (3) development of effective and efficient stack decodersearch strategies for continuous speech recognition; and (4) analysis of the interaction between truesource, training, and testing language models, and the effect of this interaction on performancetesting of CSR systems; and (5) development of a new phonetic ontext model, the semiphone, whichproduces results similar to traditional triphone systems, but which allows significant reduction inthe number of models which must be trained.Plans for the current program include: (1) continue to improve HMM CSR performance usingtied-mixture techniques, new semiphone techniques to reduce the number of states which mustbe trained, and new acoustic-phonetic modelling and recognition techniques; (2) complete thedevelopment of the new stack decoder control structure, and convert he HMM CSR to this controlstructure; (3) complete the prototype implementation f the CSR/NLP interface, and collaboratewith other groups in application of this interface to integration of CSR and NLP systems developedat different sites.417
