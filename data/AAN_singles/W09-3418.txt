LMF facilitates dataexchange among computational linguisticresources, and also promises a convenientuniformity for future application.
Thisstudy describes the design and implemen-tation of the WordNet-LMF used torepresent lexical semantics in ChineseWordNet.
The compiled CWN-LMF willbe released to the community for linguis-tic researches.1 IntroductionPrinceton WordNet1 is an English lexical data-base that groups nouns, verbs, adjectives andadverbs into sets of cognitive synonyms, whichare named as synsets (Fellbaum, 1998; Miller,1995).
The Global WordNet Association(GWA)2 built on the results of Princeton Word-Net and Euro WordNet (Vossen, 2004) is a freeand public association that provides a platform toshare and connect all languages in the world.
ForMandarin Chinese in Taiwan, Huang et al (2004)constructed the Academia Sinica Bilingual Onto-logical Wordnet (Sinica BOW) which integratesWordNet, English-Chinese Translation Equiva-n1 Wordnet, available onlineat http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webw2 Global WordNet Association (GWA), available on-line at http://www.globalwordnet.org/lents Database (ECTED) and SUMO for cross-language linguistic studies.
As a follow-up, Chi-nese WordNet (CWN) has been built as a robustlexical knowledge system which also embodies aprecise expression of sense relations (Huang etal., 2008).
In recent years, WordNet-like re-sources have become one of the most reliableand essential resources for linguistic studies forall languages (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000; So-ria et al 2009; Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004).Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO-24613) is the ISO standard which provides acommon standardized framework for the con-struction of natural language processing lexicons(Francopoulo et al, 2009).
One important pur-pose of LMF is to define a standard for lexiconswhich covers multilingual lexical information(Francopoulo et al, 2006b).
In this study, wedescribe the design and implementation of theWordnet-LMF (Soria et al 2009) to representlexical semantics in Chinese WordNet.The rest of this paper is organized as follows:Section 2 introduces Chinese WordNet and Lexi-cal Markup Framework.
Section 3 describes howwe represent Chinese WordNet in the LexicalMarkup Framework (CWN-LMF).
Section 4presents an example on Chinese word sense dis-tinction using CWN-LMF format.
Quantitativeanalysis of compiled CWN-LMF is presented inSection 5.
We also describe the application sce-nario using CWN-LMF for information interope-rability of lexical semantics in Section 6.
Section7 discusses the experience and difficulties of en-coding CWN into Wordnet-LMF.
Finally, Sec-tion 8 concludes this study with future research.1232 Related Work2.1 Chinese WordNetCreating a semantic relation-based language re-source is a time consuming and labor intensivetask, especially for Chinese due to the unobviousdefinition and distinction among characters,morphemes and words.
Chinese WordNet 3(CWN) has been built by Academia Sinica and issuccessively extended its scope so far.
Lemmasincluded in CWN mainly fall on the medium fre-quency words.
Each lexical entry is analyzedaccording to the guidelines of Chinese wordsense distinctions (CKIP, 2003; Huang et al2003) which contain information including Part-of-Speech, sense definition, example sentences,corresponding English synset(s) from PrincetonWordNet, lexical semantic relations and so on.Unlike Princeton WordNet, CWN has not beenconstructed mainly on the synsets and semanticrelations.
Rather it focuses to provide preciseexpression for the Chinese sense division and thesemantic relations needs to be based on the lin-guistic theories, especially lexical semantics(Huang et al, 2008).
Moreover, Huang et al(2005) designed and implemented the SinicaSense Management System (SSMS) to store andmanage word sense data generated in the analy-sis stage.
SSMS is meaning-driven.
Each senseof a lemma is identified specifically using aunique identifier and given a separate entry.There are 8,646 lemmas / 25,961 senses untilDecember 2008 have been analyzed and storedin SSMS.
Figure 1 shows the result of sense dis-tinction for ??
zu-ji ?footprint?
as an examplein Chinese WordNet.Huang et al (2004) proposed Domain Lexico-Taxonomy (DLT) as a domain taxonomy popu-lated with lexical entries.
By using DLT withChinese WordNet and Domain Taxonomy, therewere 15,160 Chinese senses that linked and dis-tributed in 463 domain nodes.
In addition, Huanget al (2005) further applied DLT approach to aChinese thesaurus called as CiLin and showedwith evaluation that DLT approach is robustsince the size and number of domain lexica in-creased effectively.Figure1: The result of sense distinction for ?zu2ji1 (footprint)?.2.2 Lexical Markup FrameworkLexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO-24613)is the ISO standard for natural languageprocessing lexicons and machine readable dic-tionaries.
The goals of LMF are to provide acommon model for the creation and use of lexi-cal resources, and to manage the exchange ofdata between them.
Francopoulo et al (2006a;2009) offered a snapshot of how LMF representsmultilingual lexicons.
LMF facilitates data ex-change among computational linguistic resourcesand also promises a convenient uniformity forfuture application.
More updated information canbe found onlineat http://www.lexicalmarkupframework.org .Soria et al (2009) proposed a Wordnet-LMFdeveloped in the framework of the KYOTO 4project as a standardized interoperability formatfor the interchange of lexico-semantic informa-tion.
Wordnet-LMF is an LMF dialect tailored toencode lexical resources adhering to the Word-/3 Chinese WordNet, available onlineat http://cwn.ling.sinica.edu.tw4 KYOTO, available online at http://www.kyoto-project.eu/124Net model of lexical knowledge representation.Wordnet-LMF was designed by adhering to LMFprinciples yet taking into account on the onehand, the peculiarities of the Wordnet model, andon the other by trying to maximize the efficiencyof the format.If we take Princeton WordNet 3.0 synset{footprint_1} for example, a Wordnet-LMF re-presentation can be found in Figure 2.

As LexicalRe-source is the root element in Wordnet-LMF, ithas three children: one GlobalInformation ele-ment, one or more Lexicon elements, zero or oneSenseAxes element.
This means the object Lexi-calResource is the container for possibly morethan one lexicon; inter-lingual correspondencesare grouped in SenseAxes section.
The details arepresented as follows.3.1 Global InformThe element named as Globato describe general information about the lexicalresource.
The attribute ?label?
is a free text field.Example as follows:<GlobalInformationWordnet entries using Wordnet-LMF?>3.2  LexiconIn CWN-LMF, only one element Lexicon is usedto contain a monolingual resource as a set ofLexicalEntry instances followed by a set of Syn-set elements.
The following attributes are speci-fied:z languageCoding: It has ?ISO 639-3?
as afixed value.z language: The standardized 3-letter lan-guage coding, e.g.
zho, is used to spe-cify the language represented by thelexical resource.
It is a requiredattribute.z owner: It is a required attribute to speci-fy the copyright holderz version: It is a required attribute to speci-fy the resource version.z label: It is used to record additional in-formation that may be needed.
Thisattribute is optional.Example as follows:<Lexicon languageCoding=?ISO 639-3?
la-bel=?Chinese WordNet 1.6?
language=?zho?,owner=?Academia Sinica?, version=?1.6?>.3.2.1 Lexical EntryA LexicalEntry element can contain one lemmaand one sense and has an optional attribute ?id?which means a unique identifier.The element, Lemma, represents a word formchosen by convention to designate the lexicalentry.
It contains the following attributes:z partOfSpeech: It is a required attribute.This attribute takes as its value thepart-of ?speech value that accordingto WordNet conventions is usuallyspecified for a synset.
There are fourpart-of-speech notations that are usedin CWN-LMF.
The notation ?n?
isrepresented as a noun; the notation?v?
is represented as a verb; the nota-tion ?a?
is represented as an adjective;the notation ?r?
is represented as anadverb; and the other POS tags arerepresented as ?s?.z writtenForm: It is added in case that ?id?of LexicalEntry is numerical and ittakes Unicode strings as values.
Thisattribute is optional.125The Sense element represents one meaning ofa lexical entry.
For WordNet representation, itrepresents the variant of a synset.
Requiredattributes are:z id: It must be specified according to theconvention used in Chinese WordNet,i.e.
word_sense#nr.. For example, ???_1?
means that the first sense oflemma ??
huan-jing ?environment?.z synset:  It takes as its value the ID of thesynset to which the particular sense ofthe variant belongs.
The ID of thesynset will be described in the nextsubsection.Take the first sense of lemma ??
huan-jing?environment?
for example, it will be representedas follows:<LexicalEntry><Lemma writtenForm="??"
partOfS-peech="n"></Lemma><Sense id="?
?_1" synset=" zho-16-06640901-n"></Sense></LexicalEntry>3.2.2 SynsetThis element encodes information about a Chi-nese WordNet synset.
Synset elements can con-tain one Definition, optional SynsetRelations andMonolingualExternalRefs elements.
Requiredattributes for Synset element are the following:z id: It is a unique identifier.
The agreedsyntax is ?languageCode-version-id-POS?.
For example, ?zho-16-06640901-n?
is unique identifier ofthe first sense of lemma ??
huan-jing ?environment?.z baseConcept: Values for the baseCon-cept attribute will be numerical (1,2,3),which correspond to the BaseConceptsets.
If the sense belongs to the first-class basic words of NEDO project(Tokunaga et al 2006), we encode itas 1.
Similarly, if the sense belongs tosecond-class basic words, we encodeit as 2.
The other senses will be en-coded as 3 if they are not basic words.The element Definition allows the representa-tion of the gloss associated with each synset inattribute ?gloss?.
The required attribute ?exam-ple?
of the element Statement contains the exam-ples of use associated with the synset .SynsetRelations is a bracketing element forgrouping all SynsetRelation elements.
Relationsbetween synsets are codified by means of Synse-tRelation elements, one per relation.
Requiredattributes are:z target: It contains the ID value of thesynset that is the target of the relation.z relType: It means the particular type.There are nine semantic relations inChinese WordNet, including?has_synonym?, ?has_nearsynonym?,?has_hypernym?, ?has_hyponym?,?has_holonym?, ?has_meronym?,?has_paranym?, ?has_antonym?
and?has_variant?.
Among them, the se-mantic relation paranymy is used torefer to relation between any two lexi-cal items belonging to the same se-mantic classification (Huang et al2008).
For example, the set of?spring/summer/fall/winter?
has pa-ranymy relation of main concept of?seasons in a year?.MonolingualExternalRefs is a bracketing ele-ment to group all MonolingualExternalRef ele-ments.
MonolingualExternalRef elements mustbe used to represent links between a Sense orSynset and other resources, such as an ontology,a database or other lexical resources.
Attributesare:z  externalSystem: It is a required attributeto describe the name of the externalresource.
For instance, possible valuesare ?domain?
(Magnini and Cavaglia,2000), ?SUMO?
(Niles and Pease,2001), and ?Wordnet 3.0?
for record-ing SenseKey values.z externalReference: It means the particu-lar identifier or node.
This attribute isrequired.z relType: It is optional attribute.
If the?externalSystem?
is ?SUMO?.
?rel-Type?
is the type of relations withSUMO ontology nodes.
Possible val-ues are ?at?, ?plus?, and ?equal?.126We use the first sense of lemma ??
huan-jing ?environment?
to illustrate as follows:<Synset id="zho-16-06640901-n" baseCon-cept="2"><Definition gloss="??????????????????
"><Statement example="????????????????????????????
"/></Definition><SynsetRelations><SynsetRelation target="zho-16-07029502-n" relType="has_synonym"></SynsetRelation></SynsetRelations><MonolingualExternalRefs><MonolingualExternalRef externalSystem="SUMO" externalReference="GeographicArea" relType="plus"/></MonolingualExternalRefs></Synset>3.3 SenseAxesSenseAxes is a bracketing element that groupstogether SenseAxis elements used for inter-lingual correspondences.
The SenseAxis elementis a means to group synsets belonging to differ-ent monolingual wordnets and sharing the sameequivalent relation to Princeton WordNet 3.0.Required attributes are:z id: It is a unique identifier.z relType: It specifies the particular typeof correspondence among synsets be-longing to different resources.
We use?eq_synonym?
to represent equalsynonym relation between ChineseWordnet and Princeton WordNet.For instance, Chinese synset zho-16-06640901-nmaps onto English synset eng-30-08567235-n bymeans of an eq_synonym relation.
This will berepresented as follows:<SenseAxes><SenseAxis id="sa_zho16-eng30_5709" relType="eq_synonym"><Target ID="zho-16-06640901-n"/><Target ID="eng-30-08567235-n"/></SenseAxis></SenseAxes>4 An Example of CWN-LMF FormatTake ??
zi-ran ?nature?
as an example shownin Figure 3.
??
has six senses (some of themare abridged in the figure).
Id attribute of the firstsense is ?
?_1 and its synset is called ?zho-16-03059301-n?.
This encoding of synset stands for?
?_1 with the unique ID 03059301 in ChineseWordNet version 1.6 and its part-of-speech isnoun.
Moreover, one can also learn that?
?_1has a synonym, ??
?_1 (zho-16-06653601-n).Meanwhile, this sense is also corresponded toIEEE SUMO.
Finally, this compiled CWN-LMFversion is pointed to Princeton WordNet 3.0, i.e.Chinese synset ?zho-16-03059301-n?
maps ontoEnglish synset ?eng-30-11408559-n?

in  CWN-LMF format.5 Quantitative Analysis of CWN-LMFThere are 8,646 lemmas / 25,961 senses untilDecember 2008 have been analyzed in CWN 1.6.So far the work on Chinese word distinction isstill ongoing.
It is expected that there are moreanalyzed results in the next released version.127Among analyzed 25,961 senses, there are 268senses and 1,217 senses that belong to the first-class and the second ?class basic words, respec-tively.
When part-of-speech is concerned, we canfind most of these senses belong to nouns orverbs.
There are 12,106 nouns, 10,454 nouns,806 adjectives and 1,605 adverbs in CWN 1.6We further distinguish semantic relations ofCWN 1.6 and found that there are 3,328 syn-onyms, 213 near synonyms, 246 hypernyms, 38hyponyms, 3 holonyms, 240 paranyms, 369 an-tonyms and 432 variants, respectively.The IEEE SUMO is the only external systemfor monolingual references in CWN-LMF.
Thereare 21,925 senses that were pointed to SUMO sofar.
In addition, there are 17,952 senses whichshared the same equivalent relation to PrincetonWordNet 3.0 in CWN-LMF.6 Application ScenariosThe EU-7 project, KYOTO (Knowledge Yield-ing Ontologies for Transition-based Organiza-tion), wants to make knowledge sharable be-tween communities of people, culture, languageand computers, by assigning meaning to text andgiving text to meaning (Vossen et al, 2008a;2008b).
The goal of KYOTO is a system thatallows people in communities to define themeaning of their words and terms in a sharedWiki platform so that it becomes anchored acrosslanguages and cultures but also so that a comput-er can use this knowledge to detect knowledgeand facts in text.KYOTO is a generic system offering know-ledge transition and information across differenttarget groups, transgressing linguistic, culturaland geographic boundaries.
Initially developedfor the environmental domain, KYOTO will beusable in any knowledge domain for mining, or-ganizing, and distributing information on a glob-al scale in both European and non-European lan-guages.Whereas the current Wikipedia uses free textto share knowledge, KYOTO will represent thisknowledge so that a computer can understand it.For example, the notion of environmental foot-print will become defined in the same way in allthese languages but also in such a way that thecomputer knows what information is necessaryto calculate a footprint.
With these definitions itwill be possible to find information on footprintsin documents, websites and reports so that userscan directly ask the computer for actual informa-tion in their environment, for instance, what isthe footprint of their town, their region or theircompany.KYOTO?s principal components are an ontol-ogy linked to WordNets in seven different lan-guages (Basque, Chinese, Dutch, English, Italian,Japanese and Spanish).
Due to different naturesof languages, the different designed architectureswere used to develop WordNets in theses lan-guages.
A unified framework is needed for in-formation exchange.
LMF is hence adopted asthe framework at lexical semantic level in thisproject.
The WordNet in these languages arecompiled with designed WordNet-LMF format.CWN-LMF will also be involved and benefit forcross-language interpretabilities in semanticsearch field.7 DiscussionDue to characters of Chinese language, there aresome difficulties of encoding Chinese WordNetinto Wordnet-LMF.
A brief description is pre-sented as follows.Chinese WordNet was designed for Chineseword sense distinction and its lexical semanticrelationships.
The designed architecture belongsto word-driven, not synset-driven.
So in CWN-LMF, we encoded a sense as an individual synsetand marked up the ?has_synonym?
relation whensenses belong to the same WordNet synset.In addition, how to define the basic concept ofChinese language is difficult.
So far the basicword lists of the NEDO project were used as pre-liminary basis.
We need a further method to dis-tinguish baseConcept attribute of word senses.8 ConclusionsThis study describes the design and implementa-tion of how the Wordnet-LMF used to representlexical semantics in Chinese WordNet.
CWN-LMF is benefit for data exchange among compu-tational linguistic resources, and also promises aconvenient uniformity for domain-specific appli-cations such as KYOTO in cross-language se-mantic search field.Future work is investigated with several direc-tions.
We are planning to release Chinese Word-Net 1.6 using CWN-LMF format in an xml file,including a XML DTD in the following days.
Inaddition, the use of this lingual resource for fur-ther linguistic research is also under investigation.128AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank Prof. ClaudiaSoria for her constructive comments.
