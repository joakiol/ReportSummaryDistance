We t)rot)ose to address theseambiguities with predicate argument structuresand semantic ('o-occurrence similarity intbrma-tion, and present encouraging results.1 In t roduct ionSentences with eoor(lination (:ontaill multil)lephrases of like syntacti(; tyl)e. When the givensentence shows structm'al ambig'lfit;y, tiler(; may1)e multii)le pairs of candidates tbr l)ossil)le con-juncts/disjuncts, usually a single pair of whichis identified as intended by human language un-derstanders, l?arsing for coordination shouldthus find the exact syntactic t)oundaries of these"intended" conjuncts/(lisjuncts.
Previous workelnployed a 1)reproccssing module for parsing towork on a constrained range of the candidateconjmwts/disjuncts (Kurohashi & Nagao, 1994;Yang, 1995; Okmnura & Muraki, 1994).Coml)inatory categorial grammars (Steed-man, 1990; 2000) arc known to explain a widerange of syntactic phenonmna, such as coor-dination, extraction and long distance depen-dency, without employing the no~ions of move-ment and empty categories.
While CCGs oilerexplanations ibr various natural language phe-nomena with limited combinatory rules such mstype raising and flmction composition, these arealso well known to increase the complexity ofparsing, giving rise to quite a few irrelevant syn-tactic analyses as well as relewmt ones~ a phe-nomenon often called as spm'ious ambiguity.In this paper, we propose to address  thetwo types of ambiguity with predicate argumentstructures and semantic co-occurrence similar-ity intbrmation.
1 For a more concrete discus-sion, we focus in this paper on coordination inKorean.
First, related work is reviewed in {i2.The two types of anfl)iguity arc then discussedin !}3.
We also examine the characteristics ofcoordination in a (:ortms in ?4.
In ?5, we showore: proposal to enhance t)arsing efficiency, withencouraging ext)erimental results.2 Re la ted  Work2.1 Conjunct I dent i f i ca t ionFirst, we review three of the techniques that at-tempt to narrow down the candidate con.juncts.2.1.1 Complex InformationAt)t)roaches that use conlplex information arebaaed on the assmnl)tion that there are vari-ous clues for morphological and semantic sire-ilarity between the pair of matching con-juncts/disjuncts.
The usual measure tbr suchsimilarity includes the part-of-st)eech (pos) tea-ture intbrmation.
The proposal by Agarwal andBoggess (1992) for English coordination uti-lizes a semi-parser ibr the assignment of perti-nent semantic and morphologicM inibrmation toeach lexical item in a given sentence.
The pro-cedure for the conjunct/disjunct identificationwith this infbrmation is sunnnarized below.1.
Keel) pushing the lexical items in a given sentenceinto the stack until a coordination item such as and,or, but, etc, is encountered.1This work was supported by the Korea Science andEngineering Foundation (KOSEF) through AITrc.
Thesecond author is now with SK Telctcch in Korea.5932.
With the coordination item, treat he immediatelyfollowing phrase as the post-conjunct/disjuuct.3.
Pop the lexical items fi'om the stack one by one,comparing their morphological nd/or semantictbatures with those of the post-conjunet/disjunct.The reported precision is 81%, but the methodidentifies only tile starting positions of the con-juncts/disjuncts.The method proposed by Okumura and Mu-ram (1994) for English coordination looks intothe symmetric patterns of conjuncts/disjuncts.These symmetric patterns are classified intotbur categories: phrasal/clausal patterns, lexi-cal patterns, morphological patterns, and com-plex patterns.
The first; three patterns are de-fined in terms of the respective features in lex-ical items.
The best match among all the pos-sible word sequences with these features beforeand after the coordination item is passed overto the parser.
The reported precision is 75%.This method assigns various weights to the fea-tures tbr the measure of the symmetric pat-terns.
It is not (:lear if the weight assigmnentmethod is principled and if it can also addressconjuncts/disjuncts with ellipsis.2.1.2 Co-Occurrence InformationYang (1995) utilized co-occurrence informationtbr the resolution of structural ambiguity in Ko-rean noun phrase coordination.
The methodlooks ut) the related pair of nouns and verbsti'om a large corpus and uses the statistics onthe case inibnnation of the nouns with respectto the given verb for the similarity informa-tion among nouns.
The co-occurrence similarityDSim(rq,  n2) between the nouns n, and n2 isdefined as tbllows, which incorporates tile pre-diction that the similarity of the two nouns ishigher when they are more frequently used withthe same verb of the same syntactic ategory.2.

a DSim isused to predict correctly that 'suthayk' (stack)is in coordination with 'khyu' (queue) and notwith 'yey' (example).
Likewise, 'kyesan' (com-putation) and 'thmnsayk' (search) are correctlyidentified to be in coordination with each other.

We note that this co-occurrence simi-larity information is useful when large-scale lin-guistic knowledge bases such as WordNet arenot available for the language in question.2.1.3 Part -Of -Speech PatternsThe method with pos patterns (Park, 1998)extracts sentences with coordination from apos-tagged corpus, trains the system withthe pos patterns of the left- and right-conjuncts/disjuncts, and resolves the ambiguitywith trained pos patterns (cf.

Notice that thisproblem is not mfique to a CCG-based parser.While the general solution would obviously re-quire not only semantic infbrmation but, alsopragmatic and discourse information, we exam-ine approaches that take into account only se-mantic information in this paper.4 Coordinat ion in CorpusIn an attempt o assess the coordination phe-nolnenon in ~t realistic manner, we examine apos-tagged corpus available at KAIST.
The cor-pus contains newspaper articles (40,428 eojeol),essays (41,666 eojeol), textbooks (50,208 eo-jeol), technical documents (2,729 eojeol), novels(40,498 eojeol), with the total of 175,524 eojeoland 17,123 sentences.

This can be avoided if weuse the same cell to record the synta(:tie anal-yses with the same semantics.

It is thus reasonable toconsider only those candidates with somesemantic relation.
We use the following mod-itication of Yang's (1995) original proposal.rCL Ka,rttmmn, 1989; Eisner, 1996; Komagata, 19991 Whenever the coordination reduction rule is in-voked, check the syntactic ategories of the can-didate conjuncts.2 If they are nouns or noun phrases, skip to the nextstep.
