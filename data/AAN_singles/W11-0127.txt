On the Maximalization of the Witness sets inIndependent Set readingsLivio RobaldoDepartment of Computer Science, University of Turin,robaldo@di.unito.it1 Pre - IntroductionBefore starting, I would like to ask reader?s opinion about the truth/falsity of certain NL statements.
Thestatements are about figures depicting dots connected to stars.
In the figures, we distinguish between dotsand stars that are connected, i.e.
such that every dot is connected with at least one star and every star isconnected with at least one dot, and dots and stars that are totally connected, i.e.
such that every dot isconnected to every star.
For instance, in (1), the dots d1, d2, and d3 are connected with the stars s1, s2,and s3 (on the left) while d4 and d5 are totally connected with s4, s5, and s6 (on the right).
(1)d1d2d3d4d5s1s2s3s4s5s6given these premises, is it true that in the next figure Less than half of the dots are totally connected withexactly three stars?
(do not read below before answering)(2)d3s4s5d1d2s1s2s3d4d5d6I do think that the answer is yes.
The same answer has been given by several friends/colleagues that wereasked to judge the example.
In fact, the figure does contain two dots d1 and d2, which are less than halfof all the dots in the figure, and they are both connected with three same stars s1, s2, and s3.Now, is it true in (3) that Few dots are totally connected with few stars?
(3)d3s3s4d1d2s1s2d4d5d6s5s7d7d8s6s8s9d9It is somehow harder to provide an answer to this second question.
At first sight, it seems the sentence isfalse, or at least ?strange?
: no English speaker would ever utter that sentence in that context, whatever hewants to describe.We are ready now to explore the proposals that aimed at formally defining the truth conditions ofsentences as the two ones above.
In the literature, most logical approaches to the problem state that the255two sentences are both false in contexts (2) and (3).
In (Robaldo, 2009a), drawing from (Sher, 1997), Iproposed a new alternative where they are both evaluated as true.
It seems then that neither proposalsis completely satisfatory.
The present paper proposes a ?pragmatic?
revision of (Robaldo, 2009a) thatachieves ?
what are claimed to be ?
the proper truth values of such sentences.2 IntroductionIn the Pre-Introduction, it has been asked to judge the truth values of two NL sentences according to their?Scopeless interpretation?, termed in (Robaldo, 2009a) as ?Independent Set (IS) reading?.
In constrast, ina linear reading one of the sets may vary on the entities in the other one.
An example is Each boy ate twoapples, whose preferred reading is a linear reading where Each outscopes Two, i.e.
where each boy atetwo different apples.
Four kinds of IS readings have been identified in the literature, from (Scha, 1981).
(4) a. Branching Quantifier readings, e.g.
Two students of mine have seen three drug-dealers in front of the school.
(Robaldo, 2009a)b.
Collective readings, e.g.
Three boys made a chair yesterday.
(Nakanishi, 2007)c. Cumulative readings, e.g.
Three boys invited four girls.
(Landman, 2000)d. Cover readings, e.g.
Twenty children ate ten pizzas.
(Kratzer, 2007)The preferred reading of (4.a) is the one where there are exactly two1 students and exacly three drug-dealers and each of the students saw each of the drug-dealers.
Note that these are the truth valuesassigned to (1)-(3) when dots and stars are asked to be totally connected.
(4.b) may be true in casethree boys cooperated in the construction of a single chair.
In the preferred reading of (4.c), there arethree boys and four girls such that each of the boys invited at least one girl, and each of the girls wasinvited by at least one boy.
These are the truth values assigned to (1) when dots and stars are asked tobe connected, possibly not totally.
Finally, (4.d) allows for any sharing of ten pizzas between twentychildren.
In Cumulative readings, the single actions are carried out by atomic2 individuals only, while in(4.d) it is likely that the pizzas are shared among subgroups of children.
For instance, Three children atefive pizzas is satisfied by the following extension of ate?
(???
is the standard sum operator (Link, 1983)):(5) ?ate?
?M ?
{?c1?c2?c3, p1?p2?, ?c2?c3, p3?p4?, ?c3, p5?
}In (5), children c1, c2, and c3 (cut into slices and) share pizzas p1 and p2, c2 and c3 (cut into slices and)share p3 and p4, and c3 also ate pizza p5 on his own.Branching Quantifier readings have been the more controversial (cf.
(Beghelli et al, 1997) and(Gierasimczuk and Szymanik, 2009)).
Many authors claim that those readings are always subcases ofCumulative readings, and they often co-occur with certain adverbs (May, 1989), (Schein, 1993).
In fact,in the Pre-Introduction, in order to force such a reading on (1)-(3), it was necessary to add the adverbtotally to the verb connected.
Collective and Cumulative readings have been largely studied; see (Scha,1981), (Link, 1983), (Beck and Sauerland, 2000), and (Ben-Avi and Winter, 2003).However, the focus here is on Cover readings.
This paper assumes ?
following (van der Does, 1993),(van der Does and Verkuyl, 1996), (Schwarzschild, 1996), (Kratzer, 2007) ?
that they are the IS readings,of which the three kinds exemplified in (4.a-c) are merely special cases.
The name ?Cover readings?comes from the fact that their truth values are traditionally captured in terms of Covers.
A Cover is amathematical structure defined with respect to one or more sets.
With respect to two sets S1 and S2, aCover Cov is formally defined as:1In (4.a-d) ?two/three/ten/etc.?
are interpreted as ?exactly two/three/ten/etc.?
as in (Scha, 1981).
That is actually a pragmaticimplicature, as noted in (Landman, 2000), pp.224-238.2In line with (Landman, 2000), pp.129, and (Beck and Sauerland, 2000), def.
(3), that explicitly define Cumulative readingsas statements among atomic individuals only.256(6) A Cover Cov is a subset of Cov1 ?
Cov2, where Cov1 ?

?cov1, cov2?
?
Cov.Covers may be denoted by 2-order variables called ?Cover variables?.
We may then define a meta-predicate Cover that, taken a Cover variable C and two unary predicates P1 and P2, asserts that theextension of the former is a Cover of the extensions of the latter:(7) Cover(C, P1, P2) ?
?X1X2[C(X1, X2)?
?x1x2[((x1 ?
X1) ?
(x2 ?
X2))?
(P1(x1) ?
P2(x2))]] ?
?x1[ P1(x1) ?
?X1X2[ (x1 ?
X1) ?
C(X1, X2) ] ] ?
?x2[ P2(x2) ?
?X1X2[ (x2 ?
X2) ?
C(X1, X2) ] ]Thus, it is possible to decouple the quantifications from the predications.
This is done by introducingtwo relational variables whose extensions include the atomic individuals involved.
Another relationalvariable that covers them describes how the actions are actually done.
For instance, in (5), in order toevaluate as true the variant of (4.d), we may introduce three variables P1, P2, and C such that:?P1?M = {c1, c2, c3} ?P2?M = {p1, p2, p3, p4, p5}?C?M = { ?c1?c2?c3, p1?p2?, ?c2?c3, p3?p4?, ?c3, p5?
}The above extensions of P1, P2, and C satisfy Cover(C, P1, P2).Among the Cover approaches mentioned above, an interesting one is (Schwarzschild, 1996).Schwarzschild discusses numerous NL sentences where the identification of Covers appears to be prag-matically determined, rather than existentially quantified.
In other words, in the formulae the value ofthe Cover variables ought to be provided by an assignment g. One of the examples mostly discussed in(Schwarzschild, 1996) is:(8) a.
The cows and the pigs were separated.b.
The cows and the pigs were separated according to color.The preferred reading of (8.a) is the one where the cows were separated from the pigs.
However, thatis actually an implicature that may be rewritten as in (8.b), where the separation is not done by race.Examples like (8) are used by (Schwarzschild, 1996) in order to argue against the existence of groupsand the overgeneration of readings, extensively advocated by (Landman, 2000).
Schwarzschild claimsthat the NP in (8.a) must correspond to a unary predicate whose extension is the set of individual cowsand pigs, while the precise separation is described by a contextually-dependent Cover variable.
Similarly,in (4.c) the Cumulative interpretation is preferred as in real contexts invitations are usually thought asactions among pairs of persons.
But it may be the case that two or more boys collectively invited twoor more girls.
On the other hand, in (4.a) the fact that each student saw each drug-dealer seems to befavoured by the low value of the numerals.
If the sentence were Almost all of my students have seenseveral drug-dealers in front of the school, the preferred reading appears to be Cumulative.The next section illustrates a final component needed to build whole formulae for representing Coverreadings.
This is the requirement of Maximal participancy of the witness sets, e.g.
the Maximal partic-ipancy of P1 and P2?s extension in the formula representing the meaning of the variant of (4.d).
It willbe also shown that there are two possible ways to maximize the witness sets: Locally and Globally.
Theformer predicts that both examples in (2) and (3) are true, while the latter predicts that they are both false.2573 The Maximality requirementThe previous section showed that, for representing IS readings, it is necessary to reify the witness setsinto relational variables as P1 and P2.
Separately, the elements of these sets are combined as describedby the Cover variables, in order to assert the predicates on the correct pairs of (possibly plural) individu-als.
Conversely, it is not possible to represent an IS reading by nesting quantifiers into the scope of otherquantifiers, as it is done in the standard Generalized Quantifier (GQ) approach (Keenan and Westersta?hl,1997), because the set of entities quantified by the narrow-scope quantifier would vary on each entityquantified by the wide-scope one.As argued by (van Benthem, 1986), (Kadmon, 1987), (Sher, 1990), (Sher, 1997), (Spaan, 1996), (Steed-man, 2007), (Robaldo, 2009a), and (Robaldo, 2009b) the relational variables must, however, be Maxi-mized in order to achieve the proper truth values with any quantifier, regardless to its monotonicity.
Tosee why, let us consider sentences in (9), taken from (Robaldo, 2009a), that involve a single quantifier.
(9) a.
At least two men walk.b.
At most two men walk.c.
Exactly two men walk.In terms of reified relational variables, it seems that the meaning of (9.a-c) may represented via (10.a-c),where ?2, ?2, and =2 are, respectively, an M?, an M?, and a non-M Generalized Quantifier.
(10) a.
?P [ ?2x(man?
(x), P (x))?
?x[P (x)?walk?
(x)] ]b.
?P [ ?2x(man?
(x), P (x))?
?x[P (x)?walk?
(x)] ]c. ?P [ =2x(man?
(x), P (x))?
?x[P (x)?walk?
(x)] ]Only (10.a) correctly yields the truth values of the corresponding sentence.
To see why, consider amodel in which three men walk.
In such a model, (10.a) is true, while (10.b-c) are false.
Conversely,all formulae in (10) evaluate to true, as all of them allow to choose P such that ?P?M is a set of twowalking men.
Therefore, we cannot allow a free choice of P .
Instead, P must denote the Maximal set ofindividuals satisfying the predicates, i.e.
the Maximal set of walking men, in (10).
This is achieved bychanging (10.b-c) to (11.a-b) respectively.
(11) a.
?P [ ?2x(man?
(x), P (x)) ?
?x[P (x)?walk?(x)]??
?P [(?x[P (x)?P ?
(x)] ?
?x[P ?(x)?walk?(x)])?
?x[P ?
(x)?P (x)] ] ]b.
?P [ =2x(man?
(x), P (x)) ?
?x[P (x)?walk?(x)]??
?P [(?x[P (x)?P ?
(x)] ?
?x[P ?(x)?walk?(x)])?
?x[P ?
(x)?P (x)] ] ]The clauses ?
?P [ .
.
. ]
in the second rows are Maximality Conditions asserting the non-existence of asuperset P ?
of P that also satisfies the predication.
There is a single choice for P in (11.a-b): it mustdenote the set of all walking men.
Note that, for the sake of uniformity, the Maximality condition maybe added in (10.a) as well: in case of M?
quantifiers, it does not affect the truth values.3.1 Local MaximalizationLet me term the kind of Maximalization done in (11) as Local Maximalization.
The Maximality con-ditions in (11) require the non-existence of a set ?P ?
?M of walkers that includes ?P?M .
In (Robaldo,2009a) and (Robaldo, 2009b), I proposed a logical framework for representing Branching Quantifierbased on Local Maximalization.
For instance, in (Robaldo, 2009a), the two witness sets of students anddrug-dealers in (4.a) are respectively reified into two variables P1 and P2, and the Maximality condi-tion requires the non-existence of a Cartesian Product ?P ?1?M ?
?P ?2?M , that also satisfies the mainpredication and that includes ?P1?M ?
?P2?M :258(12) ?P1P2[ =2x(stud?
(x), P1(x)) ?
=3x(drugD?
(y), P2(y)) ?
?xy[(P1(x) ?
P2(y))?
saw?
(x, y)]?
?P ?1P ?2 [ ( ?xy[(P1(x) ?
P2(y))?
(P?1(x) ?
P ?2(y))]?
?xy[(P ?1(x) ?
P ?2(y))?
saw?
(x, y)] )?
?xy[(P ?1(x) ?
P ?2(y))?
(P1(x) ?
P2(y))] ] ]In order to extend (Robaldo, 2009a) to Cover readings, which are assumed to be the most general casesof IS readings, we cannot simply require the inclusion of ?P1?M?
?P2?M into the main predicate?sextension.
Rather, we require the inclusion therein of a pragmatically-determined Cover ?C?M,g of?P1?M and ?P2?M .
Furthermore, the (local) Maximality condition must require the non-existence ofa superset of either ?P1?M or ?P2?M whose corresponding Cover is a superset of ?C?M,g that is alsoincluded in the main predicate?s extension.
Thus, (4.d) is represented as3:(13) ?P1P2[ =20x(child?
(x), P1(x)) ?
=10y(pizza?
(y), P2(y)) ?Cover(C,P1, P2) ?
?xy[C(x, y)?

(x, y)]?
?P ?1 [(?x[P1(x)?P?1(x)] ?
?C?
[Cover(C ?, P ?1, P2) ?
?xy[C(x, y)?C ?

?xy[C ?

?x[P ?1(x)?P1(x)] ] ] ?
?P ?2 [(?y[P2(y)?P?2(y)] ?

?xy[C(x, y)?C ?
(x, y)] ?
?xy[C ?
(x, y)?ate?
(x, y)]])?
?y[P ?2(y)?P2(y)] ] ] ]Note that there are two Maximality conditions: ?P ?1 [ .
.
. ]
and ?P ?2 [ .
.
.
].
In fact, contrary to what isdone with Cartesian Products, in Cover readings P1 and P2 must be Maximized independently, as it isno longer required that every member of the former is related with every member of the latter.
Notealso that the inner Cover variable C ?
is existentially quantified.
Of course, it would make no sense topragmatically interpret it as it is done with C.3.2 Global MaximalizationThe other kind of Maximalization of the witness sets, termed here as ?Global Maximalization?
has beenadvocated by (Schein, 1993), and formalized in most formal theories of Cumulativity, e.g.
(Landman,2000), (Hackl, 2000), and (Ben-Avi and Winter, 2003).
With respect to IS readings involving two witnesssets ?P1?M and ?P2?M , Global Maximalization requires the non-existence of other two witness sets thatalso satisfy the predication but that do not necessarily include ?P1?M and ?P2?M .
For instance, theevent-based logic defined by (Landman, 2000) represents the Cumulative reading of (4.c) as:(14) ?e?
?INVITE: ?x?
?BOY: |x|=3 ?
?Ag(e)=x ?
?y?
?GIRL: |y|=4 ?
?Th(e)=y ?|?Ag(?
{e ?INVITE: Ag(e)?BOY ?
Th(e)?GIRL})| = 3 ?|?Th(?
{e ?INVITE: Ag(e)?BOY ?
Th(e)?GIRL})| = 4Formula in (14) asserts the existence of a plural event e whose Agent is a plural individual made up ofthree boys and whose Theme is a plural individual made up of four girls.
The two final conjuncts, inboldface, are Maximality conditions asserted on pragmatic grounds (see footnote 1 above).
Taken ex asthe plural sum of all inviting events having a boy as agent and a girl as theme, i.e.ex=?
{e ?INVITE: Ag(e)?BOY ?
Th(e)?GIRL}the cardinality of its agent ?Ag(ex) is exactly three while the one of its theme ?Th(ex) is exactly four.Therefore, Landman?s Maximality conditions in (14) do not refer to the same events and actors quantifiedin the first row.
Rather, they require that the number of the boys who invited a girl in the whole model isexactly three and the number of girls who were invited by a boy in the whole model is exactly four.3Without going down into further details, I simply stipulate that the GQs used in the article are Conservative (Barwise andCooper, 1981), (Keenan and Stavi, 1986).
In other words, for every quantifier Qx, we require ?PBx ?M ?
?PRx ?M .2594 Local Maximalization VS Global MaximalizationWe are ready now to compare the two kinds of Maximalization.
Global Maximalization appears to bemore problematic than Local one.
Since Branching Quantifier readings are special cases of Cumulativereadings, and it has been discussed above that many authors, e.g.
(Beghelli et al, 1997), argue that thisis even a good reason to avoid an explicit representation of them, sentence (15.a) entails (15.b).
(15) a.
Less than half of the dots are totally connected with exactly three stars.b.
Less than half of the dots are connected with exactly three stars.Nevertheless, Global Maximalization predicts that (15.b) is false in figure (2).
The number of all dotsin the model connected to a star is six, while the number of all stars in the model connected to a dotis five, not exactly three.
On the contrary, once the witness sets have been identified as in (16), LocalMaximalization predicts (15.b) as true, in that no other star is connected to a dot occurring in ?P1?M ,and no other dot is connected to a star occurring in ?P2?M .
(16)d3s4s5d1d2s1s2s3d4d5d6kP1kMkP2kMAnother scenario where Global Maximalization predicts presumably wrong truth values, with respect toformula (14) and sentence (4.c), is shown in (17):(17)g1g3g2b3b1b2g4g5b4In (17), the Cumulative readings of all (18.a-c) appear to be true provided that numerals N are stillinterpreted as exactly-N .
(18) a.
Three boys invited four girls.b.
One boy invited one girl.c.
Four boys invited five girls.Global Maximalization states that only (18.c) is true in (17).
Local Maximalization evaluates all (18.a-c)as true; the witness sets are obviously identified.Landman does not discuss the evaluation of his formulae in contexts like (17).
This is done insteadby (Ferreira, 2007) and (Brasoveanu, 2009).
However, the latter do not provide strong linguistic moti-vations: they simply claim that (18.a-b) are false in (17), as the present paper claims they are not.
Acomparison between Local and Global Maximalization is found in (Schein, 1993), even if no formaliza-tion is presented.
(Schein, 1993), ?12, reasonably argues, contra (Sher, 1997), that (19.a-b) are false incontexts like (20) (or (3)), while (19.c) is true.
Local Maximalization predicts all (19.a-c) as true.
(19) a.
Few dots are totally connected with few stars.b.
Exactly two dots are totally connected with exactly two stars.c.
At least two dots are totally connected with at least two stars.260(20)d1d3s1s2s3d2d4d6s4s5s6d5d7s7s8d8From these observations, Schein concludes that (Sher, 1997)?s Local Maximalization, which is definedfor any kind of quantifier, with any monotonicity, is incorrect.
A proper semantics for NL quantificationshould instead stipulate two different semantics depending on the monotonicity: one for M?
quantifiers,e.g.
At least two, and one for M?
quantifiers, e.g.
Few, and non-M quantifiers, e.g.
Exactly two.
Thetruth conditions of the former should be defined in terms of Local Maximalization, while those of thelatter in terms of Global Maximalization.While I accept the truth values attested by Schein for sentences (19.a-c) in (20), I do not share hisconclusions.
On the one hand, there are several cases, particularly mixed cases, that are quite hard toreconcile in Schein?s view.
An example is the sentence evaluated in (2), which include a M?
quantifier(Less than half) and a non-M one (Exactly three).
Global Maximalization, contrary to Local Maximal-ization, evaluates the sentence as false in (2), as pointed out above.
Also (21.a), which includes an M?quantifier and an M?
one (More than half), and sentence (21.b), which is not a mixed case as it includestwo M?
quantifiers, seems to be true in (2), contra Schein?s predictions.
(21) a.
Less than half of the dots are connected with more than half of the stars.b.
Less than half of the dots are connected with less than five stars.On the other hand, all sentences in (19.a-c) seems to be true in (22), while in Schein?s view they shouldhave the same truth values they have in (20).
(22)d6s5s6d1d2s1s2d7d8d3d4d5s3s4s7s8These considerations lead to conclude that the oddity of sentences (19) in contexts (20) or (3) does notdepend on the monotonicity of the quantifiers involved.The present paper suggests instead that such an oddity stems from Pragmatics.
No English speaker wouldever utter those sentences in those contexts, as they would not be informative enough, and so they wouldviolate a Gricean Maxim.
From the examples above, it seems that sentences involving non-M?
quanti-fiers sound odd in contexts where more pairs of witness sets are available.
For instance, the reader getsconfused when he tries to evaluate (19.a) in (20), as multiple pairs of (witness) sets of dots and stars areavailable, i.e.
?
{d1, d2}, {s1, s2}?, ?
{d3, d4}, {s3, s4}?, etc., and he does not have enough informationto prefer one of them upon the others.
This does not arises in (3) or (22), where the witness sets areimmediatly and uncontroversially identified.The multiple availability of witness sets does not seem to confuse the reader for sentences involving M?quantifiers, perhaps because they are simpler to interpret (cf.
(Geurts and van der Silk, 2005)).
How-ever, several cognitive experimental results showed that many other factors besides monotonicity, e.g.expressivity/computability, fuzzyness, the fact that quantifiers are cardinal rather than proportional, etc.,may affect the accuracy and reaction time of the interpretation of IS readings (cf.
(Sanford and Paterson,1994), (Bott and Rado?, 2009), (Musolino, 2009), and (Szymanik and Zajenkowski, 2009)).As it is clear to understand, however, extra-linguistic factors seem the ones that mainly affect the inter-pretation of quantifiers.
For instance, in (17), if the boys b1, b2, b3 are friends who decided to go to aparty with some girls, and b4 wants to go there with his girlfriend (g5) only, the witness sets are most261likely identified for (18.a-b) rather than for (18.c), as the two groups of persons are not related.Conversely, if the four boys belong to the same group of friends hanging out together, the identificationof the witness sets most likely fails in (18.a-b).
That is probably the assumption done by (Ferreira, 2007)and (Brasoveanu, 2009) for claiming that sentences like (18.a-b) are false in contexts like (17).
Analo-gously, in the children-pizza example in (4.d), the arrangement of the children among the tables of thepizzeria, their mutual friendship, and so on, may affect the identification of the witness sets.
Similardiscussions may be found in (Fintel, 1994) and (Winter, 2000).Of course, an exhaustive study of all factors involved in the pragmatic identification of the witnesssets goes much beyond the goal of the present paper.
The aim of this paper is to argue that, once witnesssets are identified, Local Maximalization applies to them.
In order to formally obtain this result, a finalmodification of the formulae is needed: it is necessary to pragmatically interpret the relational variablesdenoting the witness sets, besides those denoting the Covers.
Formula (13) is then revised as in (23).
(23) =20x(child?

?xy[C(x, y)?C ?
(x, y)] ?
?xy[C ?
(x, y)?ate?
(x, y)]])?
?y[P ?2(y)?P2(y)] ] ]The only difference between (23) and (13) is that the value of P1 and P2 is provided by an assignment g,as it is done for the Cover variable C. g must obey to all (extra-)linguistic pragmatic constraints brieflylisted above.
The reader could start thinking that, in the new version of the formulae, we may avoidMaximality conditions, either Local or Global.
In fact, Maximalization could be simply implementedas a constraint on the assignment function g. In other words, we could simply impose g to select onlyMaximal witness sets.
If g is unable to do so, the intepretation fails as in the cases discussed above.Such a solution has been actually proposed in (Steedman, 2007) and (Brasoveanu, 2009).
Conversely,in (Robaldo, 2009b) I explained that we do need to explicitly represent the Maximality conditions.
Inother words, those are not only seen as necessary conditions needed to determine if a sentence is true orfalse in a certain context.
Rather, in (Robaldo, 2009b), it is extensively argued that they are part of theknowledge needed to draw the appropriate inferences from the sentences?
meaning.5 ConclusionsThis paper compared the two kind of Maximalization proposed in the literature for handling the propertruth values of Independent Set readings.
They have been termed as Local and Global Maximalization.The former requires the non-existence of any tuple of supersets of the witness sets that also satisfy thepredication.
The latter requires the witness sets to be the only tuple of sets that satisfy the predication.The present paper argues in favour of Local Maximalization, and claims that the motivations that led tothe definition of Global Maximalitation, and its incorporation within most current formal approaches toNL quantification, do not appear to be justified enough.
These claims are supported by showing that, formany NL sentences, Global Maximalization predicts counter-intuitive truth conditions.Also several examples are hard to reconcile in a logical framework based on Local Maximalization.
Itseems, however, that the oddity of such examples depends upon pragmatic grounds.Based on these assumptions, the solution presented here still adopts Local Maximalization, but ad-vocates a pragmatic interpretation of all relational variables.
Drawing from (Schwarzschild, 1996), thepresent paper evolves the formulae in (Robaldo, 2009a) and (Robaldo, 2009b), making them able tohandle Cover readings, which are assumed to be the more general cases of Independent Set readings.In the resulting formulae, the witness sets are firstly pragmatically identified, as it is done with Covervariables, then they are locally Maximized.
In other words, Pragmatics is responsible for identifyingboth the (atomic) individuals involved, and the way they sub-combine to carry out the singular actions.262The result is able to predict the suitable truth values of Cover readings in all examples considered, andseems to mirror the correct interplay between the Semantics and the Pragmatics of NL quantifiers.ReferencesBarwise, J. and R.
