In t roduct ioni.i.- BackgroundThis work is a cont inuat ion of  research reported in the paperMathematical Models of  S~non~,  which was presented at the 1965In ternat iona l  Conference on Computational L ingu is t ics .
That paperpresented a h is to r i ca l  summary of the concepts of synonymy andantonyms.
I t  was noted that  since the f i r s t  book on English syno-DS ,  which appeared in the second ha l f  of the la th  century,  d ic -t ionar ies  of synonyms and antonyms have var ied according to thepar t i cu la r  exp l i c i t  de f in i t ions  of  "synonym" and "antonym" that  wereused.
The ro les  of par t -o f -speech,  context of a word, and subst i -tu tab i l i ty  in the same context were discussed.Trad i t iona l ly ,  synonymy has been regarded as a b inary re la t ionbetween two words.
Graphs of  these b inary re la t ions  were drawn forseveral  sets of words based on Webster's Dict ionary of S~non~ms andmatr ices for  these graphs were exhibited as an equivalent represen-ta t ion .
These empir ical  resu l ts  showed that  the concepts of synonymyand entonymy required the use of ternary  re la t ions  between two wordsin a spec i f ied  sense rather  than simply a b inary re la t ion  between twowords.
The synonymy re la t ion  was then def ined imp l i c i t l y ,  rather  thanexp l i c i t l y ,  by three axiams s tat ing  the propert ies  of being re f lex ive ,symmetriC, and t/~ansit ive.
The entonym?
re la t ion  was also defined bythree axioms s tat ing  the propert ies  of being i r re f lex ive ,  symmetric,and antit/~ansit~ve (the las t  term was coined for  that  study).
I t  wasnoted that  thes~ six axioms could be expressed in the calculus of re-la t ions  and that  th i s  re la t ion  algebra could be used to produce short -er proofs of  t~eorems.
However, no proofs were given.
In addit ion,several gec~aet~ical and topological models of synonymy and antonymy '..J~were posed and examined.
,~I t  was nOted that  cer ta in  of these models were of more theoret i ca lthan pract i ca l  in teres t .
Each model was seen to  be simple in that  it"could be expressed from mathematical ly elementary concepts, end eachst ressed cer ta in  aspects of the l ingu is t i c  object being modeled at theexpense of others.
However, there seemed to be l i t t le  theoret i~a lpreference among them.
Their adequacy as models could be measured bythe i r  genera l i ty  and pred ic t ive  power.
In terms of these c r i te r ia  thealgebraic  model, whether expressed in terms of re la t ions ,  graphs, ormatr ices,  seamed to  have the most usefu lness.
In par t ,  th i s  was dueto  the fac t  that  one geametr ical  model, although highly suggest ive,did not include a prec ise spec i f i ca t ion  of  the or ig in ,  axes, or co-ordinates fo r  words in an n-dimensional space.
Simi lar ly,  one topo-log ica l  model requ i red  a c losure operat ion for  each of the intensionsor senses and had no l ingu is t i ca l l y  in teres t ing  in terpreta t ion .11.2 SummaryThe present paper investigates more thoroughly the characterizationsof synonymy and antonymy initiated in Edmundson (1965).
In section 2,synonymy and antonymy are defined jointly and implicitly by a set ofaxioms rather than separately as before.
First, it is noted that theoriginal six axioms are insufficient?
to permit the proofs of certaintheorems whose truth is strongly suggested by intuitive notions aboutsynonyms and antonyms.
In addition, it is discovered that certainfundamental assumptions about synonymy and antonymy must be made ex-plicit as axioms.
Some of these have to do with specifying the domainand range of the synonymy and antonymy relations.
This is related toquestions about whether function words, which linguistically belong toclosed classes, should have synonyms and antonyms and whether contentwords, which linguistically belong to open classes, must have synonymsand antonyms.
Several fundamental theorems of this axiom system arestated andproved.
The informal interpretation of many of thesetheorems are intuitively satisfying.
For example, it is proved thatany even power of the antonymy relation is the synonymy relation,while any odd power is the antonymy relation.
\In section 3, topological characterizations are posed and examined.
Aneighborhood topology is introduced by defining the neighborhood of aword.
It is proved that this definition satisfies four neighborhoodaxioms.
Also, a closure topology is introduced by defining theclosure of a set of words.
It is proved that this definition satis-fies the four closure axioms.2.
Algebraic Characterization2.1.
Introduction - RelationsBefore investigating antonymy and synonymy, we will estsblish somenotions and notations for the calculus of binary relations.Consider a set V of arbitrary elmnen~s, which will be called the uni-versal set.
A binary relation on V is defined as a set R of orderedpairs <x,p ,  where x,y s V. The proposition that x stands in re-lation R toy  will be denoted by xRy.
The dcmain~Y(R), range ~(R) ,and field ~ (F) of relation R are, respectively, defined by the sets\[x:(~y)(xRy)\] ; (y:(~Lx)(xRy)} ; \[x:(~y)(xRy)} U (y:(~x)(xRy)\]The complement, union, intersection, and converse relstions are de-fined byx~y = -.x~ ; x (RUS)y  - x~vxSy  ; x (RnS)y  " x~x~;xR'ly -- yRxThe identity relation I and null relation ~ are defined byxIy ~ x=y ; ~y  - (x~x) ,V~(y~y)The product  .and power re la t ions  are  de f ined  byxRISy = (.~z)\[xRz ^zSy \ ]  ; R n =- RIR n ' l  n~ 1I nc lus ion  and equa l i ty  o f  re la t ions  are  de f ined  byRC S =- xRy ==> xSy ; R = S m R c SA  S c RLater we will use the following elementary theorems which are statedhere without proof:Theorem: R g S ==> R "I c_ S "Im - -Theorem: R c S ~> S c RTheorem: (R'I) "I = RTheorem: (RIS)IT : RI(SIT )Theorem: (RIS) "I = S'IIR "ITheorem: IIR = RII = RTheorem: s -r => R Is=RIT  ^ SIR=TIR2.2 Axioms and DefinitionsUnder the assumption that synonymy and antonymy are ternary relationson the set C of all content words, the following definitions will beused:xSiY = word x is a synonym of word y with respect to theintension i (or word x is synonymous in sense i toword y)xAiY -= word x is an antonym of word y with respect to the in-tension i (or word x is antonymous in sense i to word y)We will assume that the synonymy and antonymy relations are definedJointly and implicitly bythe following set of axioms rather thanseparately as in Edmundson (1965).Axiom 1 (Reflexive) : (Vx)\[xSix\]Axium 2 (Symmetric): (Vx)(Vy)\[xSiY => xS;Iy\]Axium 3 (Transitive): (Vx)(Vy)(Vz)\[xSiY A YSiZ :>Axi~n 4 (Irreflexive) : (Vx) \[x~ix\]Axiun 5 (Symmetric): (Vx)(Vy)\[xAiY => xA;ly\]Axi~n 6 (Antitransitive): (Vx)(Vy)(Vz)\[xAiY A YAiZAximm 7 (Right-identity): (Vx)(Vy)(Vz)\[xAiY A YSiZAxiom 8 (Nonempty) : (Vy) (:~x) \[xAiY\]xSiz\]~> xSiz\]~> xAiz\]The properties named in Axiams 6 and 7 were coined for this study.The above eight axioms may beas follows:Axicm I (Reflexive) :Axiom 2 (Symmetric):Axiom 3 (Transitive) :Axicm 4 (Irreflexive) :Axiom 5 (Symmetric) :Axiem 6 (Antitransitive) :Axiom 7 (Right-identity) :Axiom 8 (Nonempty) :expressed in the calculus of relationsI~S isl =- si 1~i = S iAi c_ A; 1 'Ai I Si c_ Ai(Vy)\[A(y) ~ ~\] where A(y) = {<x,y> : x E~(A)}3This relation algebra will be used to produce shorter proofs, al-though this is not necessary.
The consistency of this set of aximmsis shown by exhibiting a model for them; their independence will notbe treated.In addition to the synonymy and antonymy relations it will beuseful to introduce the following classes that are the images ofthese relations.
The synonym class of a word y is defined bysi(Y ) '= \[x : xSiY\]which may be extended to an arbitrary set E of words bysi(E) =- {x : (.~y)\[y ~ ~.
^ xSiY\]\]Similarly, the antonym class of a word y is defined byai(Y) --- {x : xAiy\]which may be extended to a set E of words byai(E ) m {x : (~y)\[y e E A xAiY\]\]2 ?
3 TheoremsFor ressons of notational simplicity, the subscript denoting theintenslon i will be omitted in the sequel whenever possible.
How-ever, the theorems must be understood as if the subscript werepresent.As with any symmetric re la t ion ,  i t  is  poss ib le  to  get stronger re -su l ts  than Ax i~ 2 and Axiom 5.Theorem: S "1 = SProof:  1 S c S-1 by Axiom 2.
Hence S "1 c_ (S -1 ) - I  = S. There-fore S" = S_by def in i t iQn of equa l i ty .Theorem~ A "I = AProof: Same as above theorem using Axi~n 5.Also we get a stringer result than the transitivity property ofAxiQm 3:Theor .em: ~ SProof.

Hence S = SII c_ SIS = ~ by Axiom 1.Therefore S 2 = S by de f in i t io~ of equa l i ty .In fac t ,  by induct ion we have the genera l i za t ion :Proof, 8n= .1 s (sl~ "2) ... .

So xAx, whichcontrad ic ts  x~x by Ax i~ 4: I ~ ~.
Therefore A c_ ~.because of Axiom 8, can we get a stronger resu l t  than the ant i -t rans i t i v i ty  p~oplFty of Axiom 6.Theorem: A = SO~I :.

NowA =AI I  U AIS since I u S.Therefore A I S A by definition of equality,As a corollary we get that S and A ccexnute :Corollary.
AIS = SIAProof: AIS --A = A "A = (AIS) "l = (A'lls'l) "l -- SIAFrom the above two theorems it follows that:Theorem: S IA  = AProof: S~A =A IS =A.As a special case we ~et:Theorem: A 3 =AIA  =AIS  =A.In fact, we have the generalization:S if n evenTheorem: An = A if n oddProof: For n even, A n = A 2k = (A2) k = ~ = S. For n odd,A n = A 2k+l = AI (A2) k = AtS = A.Next, several theorems about synonym classes and antonym classes willhe stated and proved.
First, the synonym class of a word is notempty:Theorem: s(y) ~ ?Proof:  NOW I c S by Axiom 1.
So (Vy)\[ySy\].
Hence (.~x)\[xSy\].Therefore, s(y) ~ ~.Because S is a symmetric relation, we have:Theorem: y e s(x) <~> x e s(y)Proof: y e s(x) <-----> ySx <-----> yS'ix <----> xSy <-----> x e s(y).Since S is  re f lex ive ,  symmetric, and t rans i t i ve ,  S is  by de f in i t ionan equivalence re la t ion  on theset  C of a l l  content words.
Hence, wehave the important resu l t :Theorem: xSy <-----> s(x) = s(y)P roo f :  (------->) Assume xSy.
F i r s t  le t  u G s(x) .
Then uSx ^  xSy------> uS2y -------> uSy -------> u ?
s (y ) .
Hence s(x)c_ s(y) .
Alsos(y) c_ s(x) by a simi lar  argument.
Therefore s(x) = s(y) .
(<==) Assume s(x) = s(y).
Then u e S(X) -~-> U ?
s(y).
SOuSx -------> uSy.
Hence xSu ^  uSy ~-> xS~y ==> xSy.
ThereforexSy.In fac t ,  we have the stronger resu l t :Theorem: s(x) N s(y) = .~" s(x) i f  xSyL ?
i f   -syHence for a given intension i the equivalence relation S i parti-tions the set C of all content words into subsets that aredisjoint (i.e., the subsets have no word in common) and exhaustive(i.e., every word is in some subset) :Theorem: C =~ ) si(x)x~Second, the antonym c lass  of a word i s  not empty:Theorem: a(y) ~Proof: A~ 8: (vy)(~x)tx~1 ~p~es  a(y) ~ ~.Note that a word does not belong to its antonym class:Theorem: y ~ a(y).Proof: Assume y e a(y) so that yAy.
But this contradictsAxiom 4: yIy ~ yXy.
Therefore y ~a(y) .Next we w i l l  es tab l i sh  some re la t ions  between synoc~ym c lasses  andanton~a classes.Theorem: xA~ ~ ~(x) = s(y)Proof: (==>) Assume x e a(y).

Also sCy) c_ a(x) by as imi la r  argmnent.
Therefore a(x) = s (y ) .

s(y) = a(x).
Hence yAx.
Therefore xAy by Axicm 5.In fact, we get the following necessary and sufficient conditionfor equality:Theorem: a(x) = a(y) <==~ s(x) = s(y)Proof: (~--~) Assume aCx) = a(y).
Now a(x) rl a(y) ~_~z(~z) \ [ z~  ^ ~,v\] ~-~ (~z)\[xAz ^ zAy\] ~ xA-y  ~ xSy.Therefore s (x )  = s (y )  by  a previous theorem.

Then xSy.

Hence uAx AXSy ~ uAISy ~ u~y ==~ U ?
a (y ) .
Therefore a (x )g  a (y ) .Also a(y)  g a(x) by an ident ica l  argument.
Therefore a(x) = a (y ) .2.4 Comments on the Algebraic CharacterizationEven though s(y) # ~ since ySy by Axinm i, it may be necesssry toadd the following axiom:Axiom 9: (Vy)C~x)Kx ~ y ^ x~\]to guarantee that the domain of the relation S is not trivial, i.e.,s(y)-Cy\] ~?Axiom 9 is not necessary if s(y) is permitted to be a unit set forcertain words.
Thus, we might define s(y) = (y) for any functionword y, e.g., s(and) = (and).
But this will not work for antonymysince a(y) might be considered empty for certain words such asfunction words, e.g., a(and) = ~.
The alternative of defininga(y) = ~ is not reasonable since it produces more problems thanit solves.
Axiom 8: (Vy)(~x)\[xAy\] is reasonable if the contraries_of words (e.g., nonuse, impossible, etc.)
are permitted, i.e.,y e ~(y).6The theorems= S , A 2 = S , AIS =A , SIA =Acan he summarized in the following multiplication table for productsof the relations S and AS AAwhich is isumorphic to the table for addition modulo 20 11Note, even without Axicms i-8, for(1) A 2 = S , (2) A S =A , (3) A\[S = Athat 41) and 42) ?mp~ 43), (i) and 43) ~P~v 42), but (Z) and (S) donot i~  (1).Suppose that for every pair <x,y> Of words in the vocabulary V of alanguage exactly one of the following ternary relations holds :(1) x and y are synonymous, xSy2) x and y are antonymous, xAy3) ne i ther  (1) nor 42), xMyThis can be expressed by(Vx)(Vy)\[x,~ e v - - - - ->xs~Vx~vvx~\ ]which is  an exclusive d is junct ion.

Topological Characterizations3.1.
IntroductionWe will now examine two topological models of synonymy.
Beingtopological, they concern "semantic spaces" of words without anynotion of "semantic distance" between two words.
Again, we willrestrict our attention to content words.
Topological models for theantonymy relation will not be considered.3-2.
Neighborhood TopologyThe first model considers a neighborhood topology, i.e., a topologybased on neighborhoods.
A set is said to have a neighborhoodtopology if there exist elements x called ~ and sets N x calledneighborhoods of x Which satisfy the following axlcms:Axiom l: (Vx)(~Nx)\[X e N x\]~ ian  2: (v~ x) (vN x).c.~N''~x.
\[~x ~ ~x n N x\]Axiom 3: (vy)CVSx)CZs~,)\[y ~ s x ~> ~y ~ ~1Axiom ~: (Vx)(Vy)(~x) (aNy) Ix ~ y ------> Nx n Ny -- ~\]These axioms can be pictured informally by the following EulerN x N~ N x Nx NyDefine a neighborhood n~(x) of a word x as any subset of the synonymclass si(x) o~ x that cSntalns x, i.e.,X e n i (x  ) ~ s i (x  )Wain,  for- reasons of notational simplicity, the subscript denotingthe intension i will be emitted whenever possible.First, neighborhood Axiom 1 is satisfied.Theorem: (Vx)(an(x))\[x z n(x)\]Proof: By definition s(x) is a neighborhood n(x) of xc oalt aining x.Second, neighborhood Axiom 2 is satisfied.Theorem: (Vn(x))(Vn'(x))(~n"(x))\[n"(x) c n(x) n n'(x)\]Proof: For arbitary n~x) and n'(x), let n"(x) = n(x) N n'(x).Then n"(x) ~ s(x) since n"(x) = n(x) n n' (x) c s(x) N s(x) - s(x).Also, x e n"(x) since x ?
n(x) ^ x e n'(x) imply x e n(x) n n'(x) =n"(x).
Therefore, (Vn(x))(Vn'(x))(~n"(x))~"(x) ~ n(X) n n'(x)\].Third, neighborhood Axiom 3 is satisfied.Theorem: (Vy)(Vn(x))(~n(y)) \ [y e n(x) ==> n(y) c_ n(x)\]Proof:  For a rb i t ra ry  y e n (x ) ,  l e t  n(y) = n(x) .
But y e n(x)implies s(x) = s(y) since y e n(x) c_ s(x) = {z : zSx\] implies ySxand ySx impl ies s(y) = s(x)?
Then n(y) c_ s(y) s ince n(y) = n(x)c_ s(x) = s (y ) .
Also y e n(y) since y e n(x) = n(y) .
Therefore,(vy)Cvn(x))Czn(y))\[y ~ n(x) ~ n(y) ~- nCx)\].In fact, the neighborhood topology satisfies Axiom 4, which is aseparation axiom:TheorT: (Vx)(Yy)(~n(x))(~n(y))\[x ~ y => n(x) n n(y) = ~\]Proof.
Assume x ~ y.
Let nCx) = (x} and n(y) = {y}.Then x e n(x) ~ s(x) and y e n(y) ~ s(y).
Thus n(x) n n(y) ={x} n (y} = ~ since x ~ y.Therefore, with respect to synonymy, words have a neighborhoodtopology since(1) (Vx)CZn(x))\[x ?
n(x)\](Vy)(~n(y))\[y e n(x) ~ n(y) ~ n(x)\].
(Vx)(Vy)(~n(x))(~n(y))\[x ~ y ~ n(x) N n(y) = ~\]3.3.
Closure TopologyThe second model considers a closure topology, i.e., a topology basedon a closure operation.
A set is said to have a closure topologyif there exists a unary operation on its subsets, denoted by~ andcalled the closure, which satisfies the following axiums:Axiom 2:  E c_ EAxiom 3: E c E~i~ ~: .~'O-'f =~'u ~"Define the closure of a set E of words as the synonym class of E, i.e.,The closure axiums can be shown to be satisfied by using the originaldefinition of synonym classsCE) z {x : (~y) \ [yeE^xsy \ ]}However, shorter proofs are possible by noting that the synonymclass of a set E of words can be expressed ass(E) = y e E s(y) = E (X : xSy}First, closure Axicm 1 i~ satisfied:Theorem: s(g) =Proof: s(~) = sCy) = ?Second, closure Axium 2 is satisfied:Theorem: E =- s(E)oof.

Ca~nents on Topological CharacterizationsNote that for the neighborhood topology a separation sxicm has beenadded to  the  t~ree  axioms proposed in  Edmundson C1~5) .
A lso ,  theneighborhood topo logy seems more in tu i t i ve ly  sa t i s fy ing  than thec losure  topo logy.
However, for  the c losure  topo logy i f  we de f ine  theder ived  set  o f  a se t  E o f  words as  the  set  of  a l l  words that~are synonymous to  some word of  E, but not  ident ica l  to  thatWorde i.e..then  we have the fo l low i~ resu l t :Theorem: s(E) = E U g'which may be given a reasoQahle linguistic interpretation.
Anexample is {y}' = s(y) - {y} which was discussed in the sectio~ onalgebraic characterization.4.
Conc~sionsThese results support the belief that the algebraic characterizationis insightful and appropriate.
For example, the assumption thatsynonymy is an equivalence relation also has been made, eitherdirectly or indirectly, by F. Kiefer and S. Abraham (1965),U. Weinreich (1966), and others.
Since the axiom system defines thenotions of synonymy and anton~ Jointly and implicitly, it avoidscertain difficulties that are encountered when attempts are made todefine these notions separately and explicitly.iOThese topological characterizations provide a no,metric represen-tat ion of what has been called informally a "semantic space".Previous attempts to construct a semantic space that is metric(i.e., one for which a distance function is defined) have not metwith much success.
The consideration of general topological spacesavoids this difficulty.ReferencesR.
