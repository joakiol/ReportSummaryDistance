Proceedings of the Linguistic Annotation Workshop, pages 176?183,Prague, June 2007. c?2007 Association for Computational LinguisticsIGT-XML: an XML format for interlinearized glossed textsAlexis Palmer, Katrin ErkDepartment of LinguisticsUniversity of Texas at Austin{alexispalmer,katrin.erk}@mail.utexas.eduAbstractWe propose a new XML format for repre-senting interlinearized glossed text (IGT),particularly in the context of the documen-tation and description of endangered lan-guages.
The proposed representation, whichwe call IGT-XML, builds on previous mod-els but provides a more loosely coupled andflexible representation of different annota-tion layers.
Designed to accommodate bothselective manual reannotation of individuallayers and semi-automatic extension of an-notation, IGT-XML is a first step toward par-tial automation of the production of IGT.1 IntroductionMuch previous work on linguistic annotation hasnecessarily focused on resource-rich languages, as itis these languages for which we have large corporain need of linguistic annotation.
In contrast, devel-opment of annotation schemata and methodologiesto be used with language data from endangered lan-guages has been left largely to individual documen-tary and/or descriptive linguists working with partic-ular languages.This paper addresses linguistic annotation in thecontext of the documentation and description ofendangered languages.
One interesting feature oflanguage documentation projects is that, while thelanguages studied differ widely, there is a quasi-standard for presenting the material, in the form ofinterlinearized glossed text (IGT).
IGT typicallycomprises at least four levels: (1) the original text,(2) a separation of the original text into individualmorphemes, (3) a detailed morpheme-by-morphemegloss, and (4) a free translation of each sentence.Another characteristic of language documentationprojects is the tentative nature of many analyses,given that linguistic analysis is often occurring intandem with the annotation process, sometimes forthe first time in the recorded history of the language.Furthermore, language documentation projects re-quire long-term accessibility of the collected lan-guage data as well as easy accessibility to commu-nity members as well as to linguists.In this paper we propose a new XML format forrepresenting IGT, which we call IGT-XML.
Webuild on the model of Hughes et al(2003) (the BHBmodel from now on), who first proposed using theIGT structure directly as a basis for an XML format.While their format shows closely integrated annota-tion layers using XML embedding, our model hasa more loosely coupled and flexible representationof different annotation layers, to accommodate (a)selective manual reannotation of individual layers,and (b) the (semi-)automatic extension of annota-tion, without the format posing an a priori restrictionon the annotation levels that can be added.
The IGT-XML representation is thus a first step toward par-tial automation of the production of IGT, which inturn is part of a larger project using techniques frommachine learning and natural language processing tosignificantly reduce the time and money required toproduce annotated texts.Besides the BHB model, we build on the OpenLanguages Archiving Community (OLAC)1 meta-data standard.
OLAC is developing best practiceguidelines for archiving language resources digi-tally, including a list of metadata entries to record1http://www.language-archives.org176with language data.Plan of the paper.
After discussing interlin-earized glosses in Section 2, we show the BHBmodel and corresponding XML format in Section 3.Section 4 presents the IGT-XML format that we pro-pose.
Section 5 demonstrates the applicability ofIGT-XML to data from different languages and dif-ferent documentation projects, and Section 6 con-cludes.2 Interlinearized glossed textIGT is a way of encoding linguistic data commonlyused to present linguistic examples.
The examplebelow is a segment of IGT taken from Kuhn andMateo-Toledo (2004).
The language is Q?anjob?al,a Mayan language of Guatemala.

2The format of the IGT in this example is typical ofthe presentation of individual examples in the lin-guistics literature.
The raw, unannotated text (1) isassociated with three layers of annotation, shown in(2).
The first annotation layer shows the same textwith each word segmented into its constituent mor-phemes.
The next layer, the gloss layer, is a combi-nation of English translations of the Q?anjob?al lem-mas and tags representing the linguistic informationencoded by affixes on the lemmas.
The third layer isan English translation.IGT formats vary more widely in language doc-umentation, where IGT is typically the product oflinguistic analysis of texts transcribed from audio oraudiovisual recordings.
A broad survey of formatsfor interlinear texts (Bow et al, 2003) found vari-ation in the number of rows, the type of analysisfound in each row, as well as the level of granularityof analysis in each row.32KEY: ABS=abstract, COM=completive, CL=classifier,DEM=demonstrative, E=ergative, EV=evidential, S=singular,3=third person3Hughes et al(2003) also discuss variation in presentationalfactors, which we choose not to encode in our XML format.Tools using IGT Shoebox/Toolbox4 (Shoebox infollowing text) is a system that is widely used in doc-umentary linguistics for storing and managing lan-guage data.
It provides facilities for lexicon man-agement as well as text interlinearization.Figure 1 shows one sentence of Q?anjob?al IGT inthe Shoebox output format.5 Shoebox exports textsas plain text files.
The different annotation layersare marked by labels at the beginning of the line.For example, in Figure 1 the label \tx marks theoriginal text and the line starting with \dm containsits morphological segmentation.One important test case for any XML format forIGT is whether it can represent existing IGT data.As Shoebox is a widely used tool, we take theShoebox data format as a representative case study.Specifically, in Section 5 we show how texts fromtwo different languages, interlinearized using Shoe-box and represented in the Shoebox output format,can be encoded in IGT-XML.In this paper we focus on the question of repre-sentation rather than format transformation.
Eachsystem managing IGT data will have different out-put formats, requiring different techniques for trans-forming the data to XML.
The aim of this paper issimply to describe and demonstrate the IGT-XMLformat; a detailed automatic transformation methodmapping other formats to IGT-XML is beyond thescope of this paper and will be addressed separately.3 Previous workThis section discusses previous work on representa-tion formats and specifically XML formats for inter-linear text.The BHB model: four levels of interlinear text.Building on Bow et al?s (2003) analysis of differ-ent IGT formats used in the literature, Hughes etal.
(2003) propose a four-level hierarchical modelfor representing interlinear text.
The four levels en-code elements common to most instances of IGT:text, phrase, word, and morpheme.
One text mayconsist of several individual phrases.
A phrase con-sists of one or more words, each of which consists4http://www.sil.org/computing/catalog/show software.asp?id=795Data from B?alam Mateo-Toledo, p.c.177\ref txt080_p2.002\tx Exx a yet junxa tyempohal, ayin ti?

To make this more con-crete, the example in (1) shows a single phrase (or aone-phrase text).
The three annotation layers in (2)are situated at different levels in the hierarchy: Thefirst and second annotation layers are both situatedat the morpheme level, showing a separation of theoriginal phrase into its constituent morphemes anda morpheme-by-morpheme gloss, respectively.
Thethird annotation layer, the translation, is again situ-ated at the phrase level, like the original text in (1).The BHB model was originally developed in thecontext of the EMELD project,6 which has focusedon advancing the state of technologies, data repre-sentation formats, and methodologies for digital lan-guage documentation.The BHB XML format.
Figure 2 shows an exam-ple of the BHB XML format, which articulates thefour nested levels of structure of the BHB model.It directly expresses the hierarchy of annotation lev-els in a nested XML structure, in which, for exam-ple, <morph> elements representing morphemesare embedded in <word> elements representingthe corresponding words.
The model maintainsthe link between the source text morpheme andthe morpheme-level gloss annotation by embeddingboth as <item> elements within the <morph>and distinguishing the two by an attribute calledtype.While this representation provides the needed linkbetween morphemes and their glosses, it is rather in-flexible because it is not modular: To add an addi-tional annotation layer at the word level, one wouldneed to access and change the representation of eachword of each phrase.
In this way, the BHBXML for-mat is not ideally suited for an extensible annotationthat would need to add additional layers of linguisticinformation in a flexible way.6http://linguistlist.org/emeld1784 IGT-XMLIn this section we propose a new XML representa-tion for IGT, IGT-XML.
Like the BHB XML for-mat, it is based on the BHB four-level model, butit modularizes annotation levels.
Linking betweenannotation levels is achieved via unique IDs.The IGT-XML format.Figure 3 illustrates the new IGT-XML format, show-ing a representation of the Q?anjob?al example ofFigure 1, mostly restricted to a single word, tyem-pohal, for simplicity.The IGT-XML format contains (at least) threemain components:?
a plaintext component comprising phrases aswell as the individual words making up eachphrase, encased in the <phrases> XML el-ement,?
a morpheme component giving a morphologi-cal analysis of the source text, encased in the<morphemes> XML element, and?
a gloss component including glosses at both thephrase and the word level.Further annotation layers can be added by extend-ing the format with additional components beyondthese three, which describe the core four levels ofinterlinear text.Within the <phrases> block, each individualphrase is encased in a <phrase> element, whichincludes the plain text within the <plaintext>element as well as each individual word of the plaintext in a <word> element.
Each <phrase> andeach <word> has a globally unique ID, assignedin an id attribute.
We choose to give explicit IDsto words, rather than rely on character offsets, toavoid possible problems with character encodingsand mis-represented special characters.The morphemes in the<morphemes> block areagain organized by<phrase>.
Each<phrase>in the <morphemes> block refers to the corre-sponding phrase in the <phrases> block by thatphrase?s unique ID.Each individual morpheme, represented by a<morph> element, refers to the unique ID corre-sponding to the word of which it is a part.
The lin-ear order of morphemes belonging to the same wordis reflected in the order in which <morph> ele-ments appear, as well as in the running id of themorphemes.
Morphemes have id attributes of theirown such that further annotation levels can refer tothe morphological segmentation of the source text,as is the case for the morpheme-by-morpheme glossin the example in (2).Whole-sentence glosses are collected in the<translations> block, while word-by-wordglosses reside in the <gloss> block.
Again,glosses are organized by <phrase>, linked to theoriginal phrases by idref attributes.
The glossesin <gloss> refer to individual morphemes, hencetheir idref attributes point to id attributes of the<morphemes> block.Metadata information in the file headerAs suggested in Figure 3, IGT-XML is easily ex-tended with metadata for each text.
We adopt theOLAC metadata set which uses the fifteen elementsdefined in the Dublin Core metadata standard (Birdand Simons, 2003a; Bird and Simons, 2001).
Theseelements provide a framework for specifying key in-formation such as annotators, format, and languageof the text.
In addition, the OLAC standard incorpo-rates a number of qualifiers specific to the language-resource community, such as discourse types (story,conversation, etc.)
and linguistic data types (lexi-con, language description, primary text, etc.
), and aprocess for adopting further extensions.In addition to the metadata block at the head of thedocument, it would be possible to intersperse addi-tional metadata blocks throughout the document, iffor example we wanted to indicate change of speakerfrom one phrase to another in recorded conversation.DiscussionFeature overview.
The IGT-XML format we havepresented groups annotation into blocks in a mod-ular fashion.
Each block represents an annotationlayer.
The format uses globally unique IDs (viaid and idref attributes) rather than XML em-bedding for linking annotation layers.
In particular,<morph> and <word> annotation is kept sepa-rate, such that additional layers of annotation at theword and morpheme levels can be added modularlywithout interfering with each other.In its minimal form, the format has three blocks,179<text id="T1" lg="kjb" source_id="txt080_p2" title="Pixanej"><metadata idref="T1"><!-- incorporate OLAC metadata standard --></metadata><body><phrases><phrase id="T1.P2" source_id="txt080_p2.002"><plaintext>Exx a yet junxa tyempohal, ayin ti?

Itis also possible to have different types of annotationat the same linguistic level, for example manuallycreated as well as automatically assigned POS-tags.Mildly standoff annotation.
The IGT-XML for-mat keeps the plain text separate from all levels ofannotation.
However, it is not standoff in the strictsense of having all annotation levels refer to theplain text only and never to one another.
The rea-son for this is that there is no clear ?basic?
level towhich all other annotation could refer.One obvious candidate is the plain text, but themorpheme-by-morpheme gloss refers not to words,but to the morpheme segmentation of the sourcetext, as can be seen in example (2).
This makes themorpheme-segmented source text another candidatefor the basic level, but it is not guaranteed that thislevel of annotation will always be available.
At thestart of the annotation process the documentary lin-guist likely has a transcription and a translation, buthe or she may or may not have determined the mor-photactics of the language or even how to identifyword boundaries.So, in order (a) not to commit the annotator to onesingle order of annotation, or the presence of anyparticular annotation level besides the plain text, and(b) to allow annotation to refer to each of the levelsidentified in the BHB model ?
text, phrase, word,and morpheme ?, we allow annotation levels to referto each other via unique IDs.Requirements for IGT formats.
Given the natureof language documentation projects and IGT data,an IGT representation format should (1) supportlong term archiving of language data (Bird and Si-mons, 2003b), which requires platform-independentencoding, and it should (2) support a range of for-mats.
IGT data from different sources may showdifferences in format and in what is annotated (Bowet al, 2003), and may be produced using differentsoftware systems.
(3) It should be possible to addor exchange layers of annotation in a modular fash-ion.
This is important because linguistic analysisin language documentation, which typically targetslanguages that are not well-studied, is often tenta-tive and subject to change.
This will also becomeincreasingly important with the use of automationto aid and speed up language documentation: Au-tomation techniques will typically target individualannotation layers, and it is desirable to be able toexchange automatic analysis tools freely.Point (1), platform independence, is achieved byalmost any XML format, since XML formats areplain text-based and mostly human-readable.
Point(2), the coverage of IGT formats in all variants, canbe achieved by adoption of the BHB model.
Flexi-bility and modularity (point (3)) are the main moti-vations in the introduction of IGT-XML.Beyond word-level annotation.
For now the an-notation focus in language documentation projectsis mostly on the word level, especially on morphol-ogy and POS-tags.
For annotation at the syntacticlevel, it is an open question what the features of auniversally applicable annotation format should be.At the moment, TIGER XML (Mengel and Lezius,2000), with its capability to represent discontinuousconstituents, and constituent as well as dependencyinformation, seems like a good candidate.
Syntac-tic information could be represented in a separatetop-level XML element, linking tree terminals to<word> elements by their ID attributes.5 DataAn important goal of this research is to develop anXML format which will be viable for use in thebroadest possible range of language documentationcontexts.
To that end, the format needs to stretchand morph with the needs and desires of the individ-ual user.
This section discusses some issues arisingfrom actual use of the format.
The points are illus-trated with pieces of the XML representation ratherthan complete XML documents.IGT-XML has been used to encode portions oftexts from the Mayan language Q?anjob?al and theMixe-Zoquean language Soteapanec (more com-monly known as Sierra Popoluca).
Q?anjob?al isspoken primarily in the northwestern regions ofGuatemala, and Soteapanec is spoken in the south-ern part of the state of Veracruz, Mexico.
Both textscome from ongoing documentation efforts, and bothwere first interlinearized using Shoebox.1815.1 Q?anjob?alFigure 1 shows a Q?anjob?al sentence in the Shoe-box export format.
The annotation comprises origi-nal text (\tx level), morphological analysis (\dm),morpheme gloss (\ge), and parts of speech (\cp).The Q?anjob?al texts we received preserve links be-tween Shoebox annotation layers only through typo-graphical alignment.
The IGT-XML representationmakes these links explicit through global IDs usingid and idref attributes.
It also splits off punctua-tion, treating punctuation marks as separate words:<word id="T1.P2.W5" text="tyempohal"/><word id="T1.P2.W6" text=","/><word id="T1.P2.W7" text="ayin"/>In the part of speech annotation level (line \cp),the annotator has additionally marked prefixes andsuffixes, using the labels pref- and -suf, respec-tively.
In the IGT-XML, we have incorporated thisinformation in the<morphemes> level as type in-formation on a morpheme.
Figure 3 shows an exam-ple of this, extended below:<morph idref="T1.P2.W5" id="T1.P2.W5.M1"text="tyempo"/><morph idref="T1.P2.W5" id="T1.P2.W5.M2"text="al"><type l="suf"/></morph><morph idref="T1.P2.W6" id="T1.P2.W6.M1"text=","><type l="punct"/></morph>By encoding morpheme type as a <type> ele-ment embedded in the <morph>, we can allow asingle morpheme to bear more than one type label.For example, an annotator may want to mark a singlemorpheme as being an inflectional morpheme whichappears in a suffixal position.
This would be in-dicated by associating multiple <type> elementswith a single<morph> element, differentiating the<type> elements through use of the label (l) at-tribute, as shown in the constructed example below.<morph idref="T3.P1.W3" id="T3.P1.W3.M2"text="al"><type l="suf"/><type l="infl"/></morph>Furthermore, as the type label is specified in an at-tribute value, each documentation project can spec-ify its own list of possible labels.\ref Jovenes 002\t Weenyi woony=jaych@@x+tyam\mb weenyi woonyi=jay.ty@@xi+tam\gs algunos varon+HPL\t yo7om@7yyajpa+m\mb 0+yoomo.7@7y-yaj-pa+m\gs 3ABS+casar con mujer-3PL-INC+ALR\f Algunos nin*os se casan.Figure 4: Shoebox output: Soteapanec5.2 SoteapanecFigure 4 shows the Shoebox output for a Soteapanecphrase.7 In the notation chosen in this project, thecharacters ?7?
and ?@?
refer to phonemes (glottalstop and mid high unrounded vowel, respectively),while ?-?, ?+?, ?>?, ?=?
and ?.?
all mark morphemeboundaries.
Clitic boundaries are marked by ?+?, in-flectional boundaries by ?-?, derivational boundariesby ?>?
or ?.
?, and compounds are indicated with ?=?.The four different morpheme boundaries translateto morpheme types in the IGT-XML, which are en-coded as in the Q?anjob?al case:<morph idref="T1.P2.W1" id="T1.P2.W1.M1"text="weenyi"/><morph idref="T1.P2.W2" id="T1.P2.W2.M1"text="woonyi=jay"><type l="compound"/></morph><morph idref="T1.P2.W2" id="T1.P2.W2.M2"text="ty@@xi"/><morph idref="T1.P2.W2" id="T1.P2.W2.M3"text="tam"><type l="suf"/></morph>The encoding of the compound represents one ofmany choices to be made by users of IGT-XML.
Wehave chosen to present the compound woonyi=jay asa single morpheme, in line with the linguist?s choiceto notate the compounds this way in the text.
An al-ternative would be to break the compound into twoseparate morphemes, each marked as a compoundvia the l attribute of the <type> element.A similar choice exists with respect to the repre-sentation of other derivational morphology, both atthe level of morphological segmentation and at thelevel of the plaintext.
In this case, the plaintext of theSoteapanec includes boundary markers.
IGT-XML7Data from (Franco and de Jong Boudreault, 2005).182can accommodate this type of text as well as it can atruly plain text.In this Shoebox output, there is no typograph-ical alignment between annotation levels.
So themanual transformation to IGT-XML had to rely oncounting morphemes.
However there are frequentmismatches between the number of morphemes inthe morphological level (\mb) and the gloss level(\gs).
The second group of lines in Figure 4 showsan example: There are six morphemes on the \mblevel, but seven on the \gs level.
We envision thatautomatic transformation to IGT-XMLwill flag suchcases as mismatched, thus functioning as error de-tection for the annotation.
Even in the manual trans-formation process, we have marked mismatches atthe gloss level to facilitate adjudication by the anno-tator.<morph idref="T1.P2.W2.M4"><gls text="HPL"flag="mismatch" flagsrc="amp"flagdate="031507"/></morph>We also include the source and date of the flag, at-tributes which could easily be obtained automati-cally.This section provides only a sample of the is-sues encountered using IGT-XML.
One of our nextsteps is to work on automatic transformations fromShoebox data formats to IGT-XML, a stage at whichmany of these challenges will necessarily be ad-dressed.6 ConclusionIn this paper we have introduced a new XML for-mat for representing language documentation data,IGT-XML.
At the heart of the model is a represen-tation of interlinearized glossed text (IGT).
Buildingon the BHB model (Hughes et al, 2003), IGT-XMLrepresents original text, its translation, a morpholog-ical analysis of the original text, and a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss.
Different annotation layers arerepresented separately in a modular fashion, allow-ing for flexible annotation of individual layers aswell as the extension by further annotation layers.Layers are linked explicitly via globally unique IDs,using id and idref attributes.One main aim in the design of the IGT-XML for-mat is to facilitate the (semi-)automatic annotationof language documentation data.
In fact, our nextstep will be to explore the use of computational toolsfor speeding up and extending the annotation of less-studied languages.
This connection of documentaryand computational linguistics has the potential to bevery useful to documentary linguists.
It also repre-sents an interesting opportunity for the use of semi-supervised machine learning techniques like activelearning on a novel application.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Lynda de Jong Boudreaultand B?alam Mateo-Toledo for sharing with us datacollected in their documentation efforts.ReferencesSteven Bird and Gary Simons.
