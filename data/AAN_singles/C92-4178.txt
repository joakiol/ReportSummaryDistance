A TENSE AND ASPECT CALCULUSDIANA SANTOSINESC,  R. Alves Redol ,  9,P-1000 Lisbon, Por tuga ldms?inesc,  inesc .ptmay be used for further reasoning, by assuming itin the absence of contradictory information.
Fur-ther investigation should be done to connect thesenon-monotonic reasoning aspects.There may be more true statements than thosethat  can be proved.
However, this seems to bea correct property for a system modell ing natu-ral language: Ordinari ly, we only express relevantfacts - -  not all true facts.2 The  methodThe depart ing points are aspectual classes (storedin the lexicon) and morpho-syntact ic information(tenses, aspectualizers, adverbs, particles, sub-bordinated clauses, etc., which we presume aregiven by former syntact ic processing).Aspectual classes will be translated by simpleformulas talking about t imes (intervals, points orunspecified with regard to this dist inction) or con-junctions or disjunctions of these.The other mechanisms will be described by im-plications.
The formulas on both sides refer di-rectly to the aspectual classes instead of their re-spective translat ions,  enabling us to express sig-nificant generalizations.Let us make some remarks on the intendedmeaning of the logical connectives.
OR (V) l inksdifferent properties of an object.
That  is, takenin isolation, that  NL fragment or device has allthose properties, irrespective of the fact that  itmay never exhibit  them together in actual use.
Itwill be the role of other const i tuents in the textto select the intended reading.
However, that  se-lection is not compulsive, which means that  ORrepresents l inguistic vagueness.Example: An acquisition (see below) like remem-ber may be used in an inehoative reading (-~ cometo my mind~ "After some time, I remembered it"),or in a stative reading (= be in my mind, "~I stillremember it"}.
But none is enforced in UDeadmen do not remember ~.AND (A) connects a set of propert ies of a singleoccurrence, even if some do not occur (but theyAbst rac tThis paper focuses on a theory of tense and aspect(the representation f time in natural anguage) thatattempts a formM representation f the relevant lilt-guistic devices as implication rules in first order logic.It presents a rich ontology as far as verb aspect isconcerned, distinguishing between complex patternsand vagueness.Examples and conclusions are drawn from tile com-parison between English and Portuguese, pinpointingthe importance of contrastive studies both for the un-derstanding and for the evaluation of a general theoryof tense and aspect.In the paper, we present the actual translations ofa wide range of phenomena, and a short example.1 IntroductionThe method we propose to represent and reasonwith tense and aspect (T&A)  in natural languagehas several distinguished features:It is both used in the building of the seman-tic representation of natural language text, andin the inferences allowed from what was actuallysaid.
There is therefore no conceptual separationbetween parsing and reasoning.It is based on a two-step translation into first-order predicate calculus, that allows us to usestandard logic while preserving certain general-izations, i.e., some (sets of) patterns of temporalrelations are identified as lexicalizing an aspec-tual  class, and T&A mechanisms are expressed interms of the latter.Grammat ica l  mechanisms are translated intosimple implications.
On one hand, they restrict/ identify the set of s ituations they can apply to,while they may also introduce lexical informationof their  own.
This second property allows for anelegant treatment of redundancy, in addit ion toan obvious explanation for their stand-alone oc-currence (cf.
begin or just).Being proof-theoretical, the meaning of a sen-tence or text is what can be proved.
If other in-formation is brought to focus but not proved, itACTeS nE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 hot3"r 1992 1 I 3 2 PROC.

The several properties conjoined are re-lated for each actual occurrence; they are severalfaces of the same situation; and no vagueness iat stake.
AND links the several ways people maychoose to present a given situation (called view-point aspect in \[12\[).Example: An accomplishment like build may beused in a durative description ("He was buildingit slowly"), or in a resultative description ("Hebuilt it in two years')~ referring nevertheless tothe same event.
Or, in an achievement like leave,the period when a person is leaving surrounds themoment of leaving.The lefthand side of an implication represents heconditions which are required to the felicitous useof the mechanism.
In case not all informationis available, it may provide the sort of defeasibleinformation that can be seen as the type coercionproposed in \[81 .A sentence has a meaning iff there is at lea~tone derivation including all components.
If thereis more than one, the alternatives will stand in anOR relation, and one will probably be selected bythe following co-text.Example: "He was attending a course on seman.tics" could mean ~he would" at a future time pointrelative to the past in question, or that he was ac-tually attending it.Syntax defines what are the possible argumentsto the operators, thus driving inference and disal-lowing certain combinations.
One way to modelthis fact is to allow syntactic structure itself tointroduce axioms or metaaxioms, restricting in-ference order.
We stick to compositionality, butassign a non-trivial meaning to syntactic struc-ture, contrarily to e.g.
\[1\].The method thus reduces to applying simpleresolution to get al possible derived information,and possibly get rid of different interpretations.The set of all asserted formulas in the system iswhat it can understand.We will now argue for this method's adequacyto handle natural anguage tense and aspect sys-tems by presenting linguistic motivation from twodifferent languages (English and Portuguese), see\[10\] for more detail.
At the same time, wegive novel treatments of well-known phenomena.These two points, we think, should be consideredindependently.
That is, one can accept the gen-eral calculus yet proposing totally different rans-lations, or on the contrary, import our linguisticsolutions into a distinct framework.2.1 Aspectua l  c lassesAspectual classes indicate the temporal con-stituency of the situation they describe.
Theyrange from states (without any restrictions what-soever, or better, with no internal temporal di-mension) to accomplishments or achievementsthat include a complex temporal pattern in theirlexical ITleaning.
They can~ moreover, representvague concepts that materialize in different tem-poral patterns, with some common core meaning,as was described above.Our ontology is based solely in temporal prop-erties, thus cause or agentivity are consideredseparate information, contrary to the overwhelm-ing majority of aspectual classifications (cf.
theoverview in \[14\]).In the figure next page, T represents an unspec-ified temporal object, which can denote either aninterval, I, or a time point, t. We define three'basic' classes, corresponding to three irreducibletemporal patterns, and then five others in termsof the former, with some additional "low-level"conditions, linking the temporal variables amongthe elementary intervening aspectual class defi-nitions.
The sole reason why we did not defineother combinations is that we did not find, in thelanguages studied, examples of lexical items thatcovered such complex patterns.For a more detailed exposition of the classesand objective criteria for distinguishing betweenthem in Portuguese, see \[11\].
Still, some remarksare in order here:1.
We distinguishbetween changes and achievements since el-ements of the first class cannot be amplifiedin time, that is, they have to be punctual,like notice or discover, while the others alsoinvolve some encompassing time connectedto them: leave, die, open.
This shows in theacceptance of the progressive by the latter.2.
We distinguish act-states from states, onone hand, for its well-formedness with theprogressive, and from activities, on theother, because their present ense impliesthe progressive.Example: He lives there, it hangs from there=,~ he is living there, it is hanging there.

The second creates anew activity ranging over an interval containing2In Portuguese, where this clals is bigger, there isclearer evidence~ namely the existence of a straightforwarddifference in meaning between the two "simple pasts", Per-felts and Imperfeito.

The introduction of these two opera-tions corresponds to our belief that  there is moreto sentence aspect than verbal aspect, contrari lyto what most classifications and calculi have as-sumed without questioning.
It seems to us thatthe latter is a proper subset of the former.
Thus,it makes perfectly sense to let morphosyntact ic(i.e., non-lexical) mechanisms introduce new as-pect properties that  cannot be found at the lexicallevel.Let us now present some contrast ive analyses:Progressive act(P) ~ P(t) A inside(t, I)Progressive P :=?, Slat(Q) A Q(T)AP(t) A before(T, t) A short(T)Estar act(P) -~ P(t) A inside(t, I)By the first definition 4, progressive applies to ac-tivities, achievements and acquisitions, and is au-tomatical ly true of act-states, or rather: for thatclass, the progressive and the non-progressive r-sions are equivalent.The second definition encompasses the f l l turatereading and stat ive uses such as He is resem-bling his father more and more.

OF COLING-92, N^~rrl!s, AUG. Z3-28, 1992many-people-died-yesterday:Act(act(dle)) A Act(change(die)) A ...This example deliberately reflects an importantissue, namely, the relevance of non-verbal con-stituents to the overall aspect, which is the sub-ject of most calculi (see \[13\] or \[7\]).
We agreewith Krifka \[7\] on that, as aspect marking onnoun phrases in several anguages demonstrates,there is no fundamental difference in the importbrought by lexical aspect, be it of verbs or otherparts of speech.
When we postulate a verbal as-pect as opposed to sentence one, thus, the stressshould be on lexical rather than verbal.
Whatis particular to our approach is the belief thatgrammatical means (syntax or tense) may pur-port significant aspect properties not available (ornot present) at the lexical level.4 DiscussionFrom a descriptive point of view, the system pro-vides a liner characterization f verbs, drawing animportant distinction: that between the parts ofa same situation and a don't care or vaguenessassociated with a lexical item (the first is relatedto the perception of an action by a speaker of alanguage; the second is related to the languagesystem / lexicon).Second, it is based on a linguistic comparisonof two distinct languages, therefore making it ap-plicable at least to more than one.
This makes italso of interest for machine translation research.Third, we expect a system thus formalized tobe easy to extend, simply by adding new and sub-tler constraints in the form of implications and/orcomplex syntax import, and not bothering withthe reasoning algorithm, by using standard logic.Finally, we think that this method has signifi-cant advantages compared to applicational mod-els in the treatment of redundancy.
Redundancyis a pervasive property of natural anguage, butit is hard to model when one device is required toapply before another, each bringing different in-formation.
In this account, on the contrary, simi-lar information brought in twice does nothing butassert it once.To conclude, we should acknowledge that giventhe early stage of this investigation, o implemen-tation and thus testing results are yet available.5 AcknowledgementsI am indebted to JN ICT  who granted me a PhDscholarship, and to IBM Portugal for support ofmy studies.
