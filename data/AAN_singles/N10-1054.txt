Experiments on English-Chineselexical substitution show that taking a word?ssubjectivity into account can indeed improveperformance.
We also show that just usingword sense subjectivity can perform as wellas integrating fully-fledged fine-grained wordsense disambiguation for words which haveboth subjective and objective senses.1 IntroductionCross-lingual lexical substitution has been proposedas a Task at SemEval-2010.1 Given a target wordand its context in a source language (like English),the goal is to provide correct translations for thatword in a target language (like Chinese).
The trans-lations must fit the given context.In this paper, we explore the relation between thesentiment of the used word in the source languageand translation choice in the target language, focus-ing on English as the source and Chinese as the tar-get language.
Our work is motivated by the intuitionthat most good word translations will be sentiment-invariant, i.e.
if a source word is used in a subjec-tive (opinion-carrying) sense it will be often trans-lated with a subjective sense in the target languagewhereas if it used in an objective sense, it will be1http://lit.csci.unt.edu/index.php/Semeval_2010translated with an objective sense.
As an exam-ple, consider the two words positive and collaboratewith example senses from WordNet 2.0 below.
(1) positive?greater than zero; ?positive numbers?
(objective)(2) plus, positive?involving advantage or good; ?aplus (or positive) factor?
(subjective)(3) collaborate, join forces, cooperate?work togetheron a common enterprise of project; ?We joinedforces with another research group?
(objective)(4) collaborate?cooperate as a traitor; (subjective)In most cases, if the word positive is used inthe sense ?greater than zero?
(objective) in anEnglish context, the corresponding Chinese trans-lation is ? ff?
; if ?involving advantage orgood?
(subjective) is used, its Chinese translationsare ??4ff,?ff?.
Similarly, for the word collab-orate, the sense ?work together on a common en-terprise of project?
(objective) corresponds to ???,??
in Chinese translation, and ?cooperate asa traitor?
(subjective) corresponds to ?(, H?r?.
Therefore, subjectivity information shouldbe effective for improving lexical translation forwhat we previously (Su and Markert, 2008) termedsubjectivity-ambiguous words, i.e.
words with bothsubjective and objective senses such as positive andcollaborate above.We therefore incorporate subjectivity word sensedisambiguation (SWSD) as defined in Akkaya etal.
(2009) into lexical substitution.
SWSD is abinary classification task that decides in contextwhether a word occurs with one of its subjective orone of its objective senses.
In contrast to standard357multi-class Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), ituses a coarse-grained sense inventory that allows toachieve higher accuracy than WSD and therefore in-troduces less noise when embedded in another tasksuch as word translation.
For example, the accuracyreported in Akkaya et al (2009) for SWSD is over20% higher than for standard WSD.
Coarse-grainedsenses are also easier to annotate, so getting train-ing data for learning is less arduous.
On the mi-nus side, SWSD can only be useful for subjectivity-ambiguous words.
However, we showed (Su andMarkert, 2008) that subjectivity-ambiguity is fre-quent (around 30% of common words).2 Related WorkMcCarthy and Navigli (2007) organized a monolin-gual English lexical substitution task in Semeval-2007, i.e finding English substitutions for an Englishtarget word.
Mihalcea et al organize an English-Spanish lexical substitution task in SemEval-2010.Approaches to lexical substitution in the past com-petitions did not use sentiment features.Independent of these lexical substitution tasks, theconnection between word senses and word transla-tion has been explored in Chan et al (2007) andCarpuat and Wu (2007), who predict the probabil-ities of a target word being translated as an item ina ?sense inventory?, where the sense inventory is alist of possible translations.
They then incorporatethese probabilities into machine translation.
How-ever, they do not consider sentiment explicitly.Subjectivity at the word sense level has beendiscussed by (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Su andMarkert, 2008; Akkaya et al, 2009).
Wiebe andMihalcea (2006) and Su and Markert (2008) bothshow that this is a well-defined concept via humanannotation as well as automatic recognition.
Akkayaet al (2009) show that subjectivity word sense dis-ambiguation (SWSD) can boost the performance ofa sentiment analysis system.
None of these paperconsiders the impact of word sense subjectivity oncross-lingual lexical substitution.3 Methodology3.1 Task and DatasetWe constructed an English-Chinese lexical substi-tution gold standard by translating the English tar-get words in the SENSEVAL 2 and SENSEVAL 3lexical sample training and test sets into Chinese.We choose the SENSEVAL datasets as they are rel-atively domain-independent and also because wecan use them for our SWSD/WSD subtasks as well.The translation is carried out by two native Chinesespeakers with a good command of English.
First,candidate Chinese translations (denoted by T) of theEnglish target words are provided from the on-lineEnglish-Chinese dictionary iciba2, which is com-posed of more than 150 different English-Chinesedictionaries.
To reduce annotation bias, the orderof the Senseval sentences is randomized.
The an-notators then independently assign the most fittingChinese translation(s) (from T) for the English tar-get words in the given Senseval sentences.
For theagreement study, different Chinese translations (forexample, ?%?
and ???
of the word author-ity) that are actually synonyms are merged.
Theobserved agreement between the two annotators is86.7%.
Finally, the two annotators discuss the dis-agreed examples together, leading to a gold stan-dard.Since we evaluate how word sense subjectivityaffects cross-lingual lexical substitution, we lim-ited our study to the SENSEVAL words that aresubjectivity-ambiguous.
Therefore, following theannotation schemes in (Su and Markert, 2008;Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), all senses of all targetwords in SENSEVAL 2&3 are annotated by a near-native English speaker as subjective orobjective.This annotator was not involved in the English toChinese translation.
We also discard subjectivity-ambiguous words if its subjective or objective sensesdo not appear in both training and test set.
In total wecollect 28 subjectivity-ambiguous words.
Their En-glish example sentences and translations yield 2890training sentence pairs and 1444 test sentence pairs.3.2 AlgorithmsFor the English-Chinese lexical substitution task, wefirst develop a basic system (called B) to assign Chi-nese translations to the target English words in con-text.
This system uses only standard contextual fea-tures from the English sentences (see Section 3.3).We then add word sense subjectivity information to2http://www.iciba.com358the basic system (see Section 3.4).
We also compareincluding word sense subjectivity to the inclusion offull fine-grained sense information (Section 3.5).All systems are supervised classifiers trained onthe SENSEVAL training data and evaluated on theSENSEVAL test data for each of the 28 words.
Weemploy an SVM classifier from the libsvm pack-age3 with a linear kernel.3.3 Common FeaturesIn the basic system B, we adopt features which arecommonly used in WSD or lexical translation.Surrounding Words: Lemmatized bag of wordswith stop word filtering.Part-of-Speech (POS): The POS of the neigh-bouring words of the target word.
We extract POStag of the 3 words to the right and left together withposition information.Collocation: The neighbouring words of the tar-get word.
We extract 4 lemmatized words to theright and left, together with position information.Syntactic Relations: We employ the MaltParser4for dependency parsing and extract 4 features: thehead word of the target word, POS of the head word,the dependency relation between head word and tar-get word, and the relative position (left or right) ofthe head word to the target word.3.4 Subjectivity FeaturesWe add a feature that incorporates whether the origi-nal English word is used subjectively or objectively.For an upper bound, we use the SENSEVAL goldstandard sense annotation (gold-subj), mapped ontobinary subjective/objective labels.
For a more re-alistic assessment, we use SWSD to derive the sub-jectivity sense label automatically (auto-subj) usingstandard supervised binary SVMs and the features inSection 3.3 on the SENSEVAL data.3.5 Sense FeaturesWe compare using subjectivity information to usingfull fine-grained word sense information, incorpo-rating a feature that specifies the exact word senseof the target word to be translated.
This setting3http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/?cjlin/libsvm4http://w3.msi.vxu.se/?nivre/research/MaltParser.htmlalso compares the SENSEVAL gold standard (gold-senses) and automatically predicted sense informa-tion (auto-senses), the latter via supervised multi-class learning on the SENSEVAL dataset.4 Experiments and EvaluationFor the English-Chinese lexical substitution task, weevaluate 6 different methods: Baseline (assign themost frequent translation to all examples), B (usecommon features), B+gold subj (incorporate goldstandard word sense subjectivity), B+gold sense (in-corporate gold standard sense), B+auto subj (incor-porate automatically predicted word sense subjectiv-ity), and B+auto sense (incorporate automaticallypredicted fine-grained senses).
We measure lexicalsubstitution accuracy on the SENSEVAL test data bycomparing to the human gold standard annotation(see Section 3.1).
Results are listed in Table 1.Results.
Table 1 shows that our standard lexicalsubstitution system B improves strongly (near 11%average accuracy gain) over the most frequent trans-lation baseline.
Incorporating sense subjectivity asin B+gold subj leads to a further strong improve-ment, confirming our hypothesis that word sensesubjectivity can improve lexical substitution.
Incor-porating fine-grained senses B+gold senses yieldsonly a slightly higher gain, showing that a coarse-grained subjective/objective classification might besufficient for subjectivity-ambiguous words for aid-ing translation.
In addition, the small gain usingfine-grained senses might disappear in practice asautomatic WSD is a more challenging task thanSWSD: in our experiment, B+auto sense performsworse than B+auto subj.
The current improve-ment of B+auto subj over B is significant (McNe-mar test at the 5% level).
The difference betweenthe actual performance of word sense subjectivityand its potential as exemplified in B+gold subj is,obviously, caused by imperfect performance of theSWSD component, mostly due to a distributionalbias in the SENSEVAL training data, with few ex-amples for rarer senses of the target words.For some words (such as authority and stress),the additional sense subjectivity feature does not im-prove lexical substitution, even when gold standardlabels are used.
There are two main reasons for this.First, one candidate Chinese translation might cover359Table 1: Accuracy of lexical substitution with differentdifferent feature settingsWord Subjectivityof SensesBaseline Basic(B)B+goldsubjB+goldsensesB+autosubjB+autosensesauthority 3-S 4-O 50.5% 70.3% 70.3% 84.6% 70.3% 79.1%blind 2-S 1-O 87.0% 88.9% 94.4% 94.4% 88.9% 88.9%cool 3-S 3-O 46.0% 46.0% 68.0% 68.0% 58.0% 48.0%dyke 1-S 1-O 89.3% 89.3% 92.9% 92.9% 89.3% 89.3%fatigue 1-S 2-O 1-B 80.0% 80.0% 82.5% 85.0% 82.5% 82.5%fine 5-S 4-O 78.5% 78.5% 90.8% 80.0% 80.0% 78.5%nature 1-S 3-O 1-B 53.3% 62.2% 73.3% 71.1% 64.4% 62.2%oblique 1-S 1-O 65.5% 75.9% 86.2% 89.7% 79.3% 79.3%sense 3-S 2-O 47.5% 67.5% 77.5% 77.5% 75.0% 72.5%simple 2-S 2-O 1-B 71.2% 71.2% 75.8% 74.2% 72.7% 71.2%stress 3-S 2-O 92.1% 92.1% 92.1% 92.1% 92.1% 92.1%collaborate 1-S 1-O 90.0% 90.0% 93.3% 93.3% 93.3% 90.0%drive 3-S 5-O 1-B 51.4% 78.4% 89.2% 86.5% 83.8% 78.4%play 4-S 13-O 1-B 23.3% 40.0% 48.3% 56.7% 41.7% 43.3%see 7-S 11-O 30.9% 36.8% 58.8% 61.8% 42.6% 38.2%strike 3-S 10-O 1-B 20.5% 27.3% 43.2% 45.5% 29.5% 38.6%treat 2-S 4-O 36.4% 61.4% 65.9% 81.8% 56.8% 65.9%wander 1-S 2-O 1-B 79.2% 81.3% 83.3% 83.3% 81.3% 81.3%work 2-S 9-O 2-B 56.8% 56.8% 75.0% 75.0% 63.6% 61.4%appear 1-S 2-O 42.7% 63.4% 80.2% 90.8% 65.6% 66.4%express 2-S 2-O 81.5% 81.5% 90.7% 88.9% 83.3% 81.5%hot 3-S 4-O 1-B 85.0% 85.0% 85.0% 85.0% 85.0% 85.0%image 3-S 4-O 56.7% 83.6% 94.0% 92.5% 85.1% 79.1%interest 2-S 4-O 1-B 38.7% 73.1% 84.9% 88.2% 74.2% 71.0%judgment 4-S 3-O 46.9% 65.6% 78.1% 75.0% 68.8% 62.5%miss 3-S 5-O 50.0% 63.3% 70.0% 66.7% 63.3% 60.0%solid 4-S 10-O 40.0% 40.0% 44.0% 48.0% 44.0% 44.0%watch 3-S 4-O 86.3% 86.3% 90.2% 88.2% 86.3% 86.3%AVERAGE 57.4% 68.5% 77.9% 80.2% 70.7% 70.1%both subjective and objective uses of the word.
Forexample, both the objective sense (?physics forcethat produces strain on a physical body?)
and sub-jective senses (?difficulty that causes worry or emo-tional emotional tension?
and ?
a state of mentalor emotional strain or suspense? )
of stress are of-ten translated as ????
in Chinese.
Second, insome cases, subjectivity word sense disambiguationis too coarse-grained and finer-grained WSD is ac-tually necessary.
For example, the subjective usagesof authority in SENSEVAL examples are often trans-lated as ?
;[, %?, ?g&?
or ??&?
(calledList-S), and objective usages are often translatedas ?
?, ??,??
?,??, ??
or ?
?, 1O?
(called List-O).
In this case, word sense subjectivitymight help to distinguish List-S from List-O, butnot among the candidate translations within a singlelist.5 DiscussionWe tackle cross-lingual lexical substitution as a su-pervised task, using sets of manual translations for atarget word as training data even for baseline systemB.
However, we do not necessarily need dedicatedhuman translated data as we could also use existingparallel texts in which the target word occurs.
There-fore, we think that a supervised approach to lexicalsubstitution is feasible.
However, we do need addi-tional monolingual sense-tagged data in the sourcelanguage for incorporating our word sense subjec-tivity features.5 Although a disadvantage, more andmore sense-tagged data does become available (suchas OntoNotes).
We also only need tagging at acoarse-grained sense level, which is much easier tocreate than fine-grained data.6 Conclusion and Future WorkWe investigate the relation between word sense sub-jectivity and cross-lingual lexical substitution.
Theexperimental results show that incorporating wordsense subjectivity into a standard supervised classi-fication model yields a significantly better perfor-mance for an English-Chinese lexical substitutiontask.
We also compare the effect of sense subjec-tivity to the effect of fine-grained sense informa-tion on lexical substitution.
The differences be-tween the two methods turn out to be small, mak-ing a case for the ?easier?, coarse-grained SWSDover WSD for subjectivity-ambiguous words.
Fu-ture work will widen the study by (i) looking at awider range of words and languages, (ii) improv-ing automatic SWSD results for better applicationand (iii) integrating unsupervised subjectivity fea-tures into cross-lingual lexical substitution.ReferencesCem Akkaya, Janyce Wiebe, and Rada Mihalcea.
