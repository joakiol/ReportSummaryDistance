On each translation direction, allthe submitted systems were combined intoa consensus translation.
These consen-sus translations always improve transla-tion quality of the best individual system.1 IntroductionThe UPV-PRHLT approach to MT system combi-nation is based on a refined version of the algo-rithm described in (Gonza?lez-Rubio and Casacu-berta, 2010), with additional information to copewith hypotheses of different quality.In contrast to most of the previous approachesto combine the outputs of multiple MT sys-tems (Bangalore et al, 2001; Jayaraman andLavie, 2005; Matusov et al, 2006; Schroeder etal., 2009), which are variations over the ROVERvoting scheme (Fiscus, 1997), we consider theproblem of computing a consensus translation asthe problem of modelling a set of string patternswith an adequate prototype.
Under this frame-work, the translation hypotheses of each of theMT systems are considered as individual patternsin a set of string patterns.
The (generalised) me-dian string, which is the optimal prototype of a setof strings (Fu, 1982), is the chosen prototype tomodel the set of strings.2 System Combination AlgorithmThe median string of a set is defined as the stringthat minimises the sum of distances to the stringsin the set.
Therefore, defining a distance betweenstrings is the primary problem to deal with.The most common definition of distance be-tween two strings is the Levenshtein distance,also known as edit distance (ED).
This metriccomputes the optimal sequence of edit operations(insertions, deletions and substitutions of words)needed to transform one string into the other.
Themain problem with the ED is its dependence on thelength of the compared strings.
This fact led to thedefinition of a new distance whose value is inde-pendent from the length of the strings compared.This normalised edit distance (NED) (Vidal et al,1995) is computed by averaging the number of editoperations by the length of the edit path.
The ex-perimentation in this work was carried out usingthe NED.2.1 Median StringGiven a set E = e1, .

N weightsthe contribution of the hypothesis n to the sum ofdistances, and therefore, it denotes the significanceof hypothesis n in the computation of the medianstring.
The value wn can be seen as a measure ofthe ?quality?
of hypothesis n.Computing the median string is a NP-Hardproblem (de la Higuera and Casacuberta, 2000),therefore we can only build approximations to themedian string by using several heuristics.
In thiswork, we follow two different approximations: theset median string (Fu, 1982) and the approximatemedian string (Mart?
?nez et al, 2000).2962.2 Set Median StringThe most straightforward approximation to themedian string corresponds to the search of a setmedian string.
Under this approximation, thesearch is constrained to the strings in the given in-put set.
The set median string can be informallydefined as the most ?centred?
string in the set.
Theset median string of the set E (noted as Ms(E))is given by:Ms(E) = argmine?
?EN?n=1[wn ?
D(e?, en)].
(2)The set median string can be computed in poly-nomial time (Fu, 1982; Juan and Vidal, 1998).Unfortunately, in some cases, the set median maynot be a good approximation to the median string.For example, in the extreme case of a set of twostrings, either achieves the minimum accumulateddistance to the set.
However, the set median stringis a useful initialisation in the computation of theapproximate median string.2.3 Approximate Median StringA good approximation to efficiently compute themedian string is proposed in (Mart?
?nez et al,2000).
To compute the approximate median stringof the set E, the algorithm starts with an initialstring e which is improved by successive refine-ments in an iterative process.
This iterative pro-cess is based on the application of different editoperations over each position of the string e look-ing for a reduction of the accumulated distance tothe strings in the set.
Algorithm 1 describes thisiterative process.The initial string can be a random string ora string computed from the set E. Martinez etal.
(2000) proposed two kinds of initial strings: theset median string of E and a string computed by agreedy algorithm, both of them obtained similarresults.
In this work, we start with the set medianstring in the initialisation of the computation of theapproximate median string of the set E. Over thisinitial string we apply the iterative procedure de-scribed in Algorithm 1 until there is no improve-ment.
The final median string may be differentfrom the original hypotheses.The computational time cost of Algorithm 1 islinear with the number of hypotheses in the com-bination, and usually only a moderate number ofiterations is needed to converge.For each position i in the string e:1.
Build alternatives:Substitution: Make x = e. For each word a ?

Some of theentrants to the shared translation task submit listsof n-best translations, but, in our experience, if alarge number of systems is available, using n-besttranslations does not allow to obtain better consen-sus translations than using single best translations,but raises computation time significantly.
Conse-quently, we compute consensus translations onlyusing the single best translation of each individ-ual MT system.
Table 1 shows the number of sys-tems submitted and gives an overview of the testcorpus on each translation direction.
The numberof running words is the average number of run-ning words in the test corpora, from where theconsensus translations were computed; the vocab-ulary is the merged vocabulary of these test cor-pora.
All the experiments were carried out withthe true-cased, detokenised version of the tuningand test corpora, following the WMT 2010 sub-mission guidelines.3.1 Evaluation CriteriaWe will present translation quality results in termsof translation edit rate (TER) (Snover et al, 2006)and bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) (Pa-297cz?en en?cz de?en en?de es?en en?es fr?en en?frSubmitted systems 6 11 16 12 8 10 14 13Avg.

Kstands for thousands of elements.pineni et al, 2002).
TER is computed as the num-ber of edit operations (insertions, deletions andsubstitutions of single words and shifts of word se-quences) to convert the system hypothesis into thereference translation.
BLEU computes a geomet-ric mean of the precision of n-grams multiplied bya factor to penalise short sentences.3.2 Weighted Sum of DistancesIn section 2, we define the median string of a setas the string which minimises a weighted sum ofdistances to the strings in the set (Eq.
(1)).
Theweights wn in the sum can be tuned.
We computea weight value for each MT system as a whole, i.e.all the hypotheses of a given MT system share thesame weight value.
We study the performance ofdifferent sets of weight looking for improvementsin the quality of the consensus translations.
Theseweight values are derived from different automaticMT evaluation measures:?
BLEU score of each system.?
1.0 minus TER score of each system.?
Number of times the hypothesis of each sys-tem is the best TER-scoring translation.We estimate these scores on the tuning corpora.A normalisation is performed to transform thesescores into the range [0.0, 1.0].
After the normal-isation, a weight value of 0.0 is assigned to thelowest-scoring hypothesis, i.e.
the lowest-scoringhypothesis is not taking into account in the com-putation of the median string.3.3 System Combination ResultsOur framework to compute consensus translationsallows multiple combinations varying the medianstring algorithm or the set of weight values usedin the weighted sum of distances.
To assure thesoundness of our submission to the WMT 2010system combination task, the experiments on thetuning corpora were carried out in a leaving-one-out fashion dividing the tuning data into 5 partsand averaging translation results over these 5 par-titions.
On each of the experiments, 4 of the par-titions are devoted to obtain the weight values forthe weighted sum of distances while BLEU andTER scores are calculated on the consensus trans-lations of the remaining partition.Table 2 shows, on each translation direction,the performance of the consensus translations onthe tuning corpora.
The consensus translationswere computed with the set median string and theapproximated median string using different setsof weight values: Uniform, all weights are setto 1.0, BLEU-based weights, TER-based weightsand oracle-based weights.
In addition, we displaythe performance of the best of the individual MTsystems for comparison purposes.
The number ofMT systems combined for each translation direc-tion is displayed between parentheses.On all the translation directions under study, theconsensus translations improved the results of thebest individual systems.
E.g.
TER improved from66.0 to 63.3 when translating from German intoEnglish.
On average, the set median strings per-formed better than the best individual system, butits results were always below the performance ofthe approximate median string.
The use of weightvalues computed from MT quality measures al-lows to improve the quality of the consensus trans-lation computed.
Specially, oracle-based weightvalues that, except for the cz?en task, always per-form equal or better than the other sets of weightvalues.
We have observed that no improvementscan be achieved with uniform weight values; it isnecessary to penalise low quality hypotheses.To compute our primary submission to theWMT 2010 system combination task we choosethe configurations that obtain consensus transla-tions with highest BLEU score on the tuning cor-pora.
The approximate median string using oracle-based scores is the chosen configuration for alltranslation directions, except on the cz?en trans-lation direction for which TER-based weights per-formed better.

These results confirm the resultson the tuning data.
On all translation directions,our submissions perform better than the best indi-vidual systems as measured by BLEU and TER.4 SummaryWe have studied the performance of two consen-sus translation algorithms that based in the compu-tation of two different approximations to the me-dian string.
Our algorithms use a weighted sum ofdistances whose weight values can be tuned.
Weshow that using weight values derived from auto-matic MT quality measures computed on the tun-ing corpora allow to improve the performance ofthe best individual system on all the translation di-rections under study.AcknowledgementsThis paper is based upon work supportedby the EC (FEDER/FSE) and the SpanishMICINN under the MIPRCV ?Consolider In-genio 2010?
