Rhetoric and Intentions in DiscourseRobert  Da.lerda?cogsci, edinburgh, ac .
ukThis brief note offers some views on the following questions:What is the precise relationship between rhetorical relations and intentions?
Do theyperform different (but possibility related) functions, or are rhetorical relations the re-alizations of intentions, or should rhetorical relations be discarded as a misconstrual ofintentions proper?To make this more concrete, we'll focus on a specific pair of theories.
We'll take Grosz and Sidner'sTheory of Discourse Structures (henceforth GSDT) to be a good example of a theory whose notionof discourse structure is based on intentions; and we'll take Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) tobe a good example of a theory whose notion of discourse structure is based on rhetorical relations.On the face of it these theories are rather similar: both provide hierarchical characterisations oftexts, and both seem concerned with the purpose of the text - for GSDT, the text realizes theintentional structure that underlies it; and for R.ST, the text is structured in terms of the rhetoricalrelations that hold between its parts.
But these similarities are only skin deep.
The kinds oftrees used by the two theories are actually quite different: in GSDT, text can appear at both leafnodes and internal nodes in the trees; whereas in RST, text can only appear at leaf nodes.
Sothe structures might be isomorphic trader some mapping but that mapping remains to be workedout (at the very least, isonaorphism could only be achiew~d by annotating arcs iu an intentionalstructure tree with "rhetorical" labels; there is an interesting parallel here with the dilference betweendependency grammar and phrase structure gramnaar).
A more significant, difference is that, in RST,leaf nodes (the atomic text spans) are typically taken to be single clauses; but in GSDT, if our atomicelements (the bottom level discourse segments) were clauses, then, given the constraints the theoryclaims on pronominalization a d reference, we'd rule out as anomolous a large space of perfectlylegitimate pronominalizations (those where the antecedent and anaphor are in clauses at the samelevel of embedding in the discourse structure: recall that material in a sister discourse segment isinaccessible).
Given this, it would be hard to argue that RST's text spans correspond to GSDT'sdiscourse segments.This point is more important han it might: at first seem, since it draws attention to a relativelyunnoticed ifference between the two approaches: in RST, rhetorical relations are deemed to hold atall levels of discourse, including between individual clauses; whereas in GSDT, intentional relationscan hold between individual clauses (precisely in those c~Lses where individual clauses correspond toindividual discourse segments), but they need not do so - it's perfectly within the bounds of the5theory to have two clauses between which there is neither a DOM nor all SP relationship.
This opensthe possibil ity that there need not be an intention underyling each individual clause or sentence.RST's  desire to postulate rhetorical relations all the way down to the level of clauses can be seenas tile root of a prol)lem that gives rise to another more frequenty voiced concern about the theory:that many of the so-called rhetorical relations are subject-matter relations, and very few are presen-tational.
If, a.t the end of the day, we feel the need to postulate some relation between two sentenceswhere the only obvious connection is that the event described by one follows the event described bythe other, then it's hardly surprising that we feel the need to include a notion of SEQUENCE inour set of relations.
But why stop there?
Wc can ofl.en include information which might have beenexl)rcssed in separate sentences using a noun phrase modifier instead: do we then want to say thatthere is a rhetorical relation between a head noun and each of its associated adjectives?
I wouldsuggest not; and that the first step we should take towards clearing up the confusion here is to banishthose rhetorical relations which simply "mirror" underlying knowledge base relations.
Doing thiswill also remove the problem that sometimes appears in the analysis of rhetorical structures, wherethe analyst is unsure which of several different but equally plausible relations hould be postulatedI)etweeu two elements: once we accept that all we are often really doing is identifying knowledge baserelations, then it becomes unsurprising that two elements might equally well be related by means ofa CAUSE relation or an EVIDENCE relation, since there can I)e any number of relations betweentwo entities in the knowledge base (precisely because we assume there is no need for structures tobe linea.r or tree-shaped: typically they are thought of as graphs).Taking this step will have two consequences.
First, it will reduce substantial ly the number of textualrelations we are willing to consider as rhetorical relations; and second, it will allow us to contemplaterhetorical structures which do not need to provide an analysis all the way down to individual clauses.This brings us closer to the thinking that lies behind GSDT, and answers some of its objectionsagainst RST; but we do not need to adopt as minimalist approach as GSDT when it comes toenumerating the possible relationships in a text..
Indeed, t.here is a sense in which GSDT fallsfoul of some of the same problems that affect RST: in particular, tieing the notion of intentionalstructure to the structure of the task that underlies a text leads us to postulate communicativeintentions that mirror the goals and subgoals in the task itself, but this is l ittle better than havingrhetorical relations that mirror the underlying domain relations.
A better way forward is to beginwith those R,ST relations which are clearly *not* domain relations, such as MOTIVATION andJUST IF ICATION,  and to elaborate their definitions in order to build towards a proper theory ofcommunicative intention and purpose.
