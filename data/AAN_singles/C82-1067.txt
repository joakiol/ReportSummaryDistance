This paper explains how toobtain the semantic information for the dictionary from an ordi-nary Japanese language dictionary with about 60,000 items (whichhad already been put into machine readable form) and also explainswhat should be the frame for the representation of meaning of eachitem (word).
Then a man-assisted machine procedure that embedsthe semantic graph with respect to the head word of the ordinarydictionary into the frame of a head word is discussed.I.
INTRODUCTIONThere are following two obstacles to the construction of a practical size semanticdictionary for natural language processing.
One is that the number of words areso large that i t  is unknown from what and how to obtain semantic informationnecessary for the dictionary (tens of thousands general words should be accomo-dated).
The other is that i t  is unknown how to seize and represent the meaning ofeach word.We are going to settle the problems as follows.
For the f i r s t  problem, obtain theinformation necessary for the semantic dictionary from ordinary dictionary ofJapanese language by analizing the sentences defining headwords.
For the secondproblem, represent the meaning of a word by using the frame the structure of whichhas been studied extensively by us for a couple of decade (YOSHIDA (1982)).Figure I is the outline of the construction steps of the semantic dictionary.In this report we discuss, as preliminary stage of the construction, about theframing of the contents of the sentences defining words in the ordinary dictiona-ry.
The discussions are to be held about the followings.
(1) Features of the structure and the contents of the sentence defining (des-cribing the meaning of) a headword.
(2) The use of semanticgraph as a scheme for the representation of meaning(structure) given by the sentence that define a head word in the ordinary dic-tionary.
(3) The frame to represent the meaning of a word.
(4) The way of embedding the information obtained from the semantic graph in theframe given by (3).
(5) The way of obtaining the meaning (definition) of a word by unifying partialdefinitions" (given by (4)) concerning the word.2.
INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM AN ORDINARY JAPANESE LANGUAGE DICTIONARY ANDFEATURES OF THE SENTENCES THAT DEFINE HEADWORDSWe have chosen the medium size Japanese language dictionary (Shinmeikai Kokugo419420 S. YOSHIDA, H. TSURUMARU and T, HITAKAj i ten,  Published by Sanseido) to use for constructing the semantic dictionary.The reasons for the choice of this dictionary are as follows.
(l) The number of headwords are adequate (about 60,000 items).
(2) Had already been put into machine readable form.
(3) Put emphasis on describing the meaning (signification) of a word by sentences,and avoided mere restatement in other words.
(4) Tried to classify the meanings of words into several large groups and avoideduseless small groups.Information that can be obtained from the dictionary are as follows.
(1) Syntactic information such as part of speech, inflection and conjugation.
(2) The described meaning of a headword.
(3) Several classified meanings of a multivocal words.
(4) Detailed meaning in its context and delicate shade of meaning of synonyms.
(5) Synonym, antonym and idiom (idiomatic phrase).
(6) Selection of significant words.The features of words definitions in the dictionary are as follows.
(1) Symbols and abbreviations are used in place of sentences.e.g.
==~>... : make reference to .
.
.
~ : the five conjugations of verbs( - - ) .
.
.
:  antonym is .
.
.
~ : adjective?
.. : noun form i s - - .
~?
: German (language)(2) P-N type (Noun modified by Predicate) and N-N type (Noun modified by Noun)phrase are used extensively.
(3) Words are abridged from the sentence into which the meaning is condensed,because of assuming the human use of the dictionary.
(4) The meaning of a headword is defined by viewing i t  from some aspects or fromits upper words (or synonyms).
(5) When we look up in turn the upper words (or synonyms) of a headword, the ex-planation may be broken off, skipped or get into a cycle.3.
SEt, ANTIC GRAPH REPRESENTATION OF A WORD DEFINITIONThe definition of a word should be given as accurately as possible in order toextract (meaning) information for the semantic dictionary from i t .
Thus thesemantic graph is introduced for the representation of the word definition.
Thesemantic graph which is a kind of semantic network consists of nodes (expressedby <.-.>) and arcs (or links; expressed by arrows) connecting the nodes.
Thesemantic graph with respect to a word is the conceptual dependency graph of thesentence (called semantic graph of the sentence) defining the word.
Nodes expressthe conceptual words (nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives expressed with <...>) andarcs represent the relations between them.
These relations are mainly given bythe functions (called \]ink information) expressed by the relational words such asparticles.Examples of relations or link information are : 'a kind of relat ion',  'case rela-t ion' ,  'cause-effect relat ion' ,  'synonym-antonym relat ion' ,  'mode', 'attr ibute' ,'state' An exmaple of the semantic graph which is derived from the definitionsentence "~(drawing  paper) :~<k~?~B?~(whi te  and sl ightly thickpaper for drawing a picture)" is shown in Fig.2.
In Fig.2, relational words areshown expl ic i t ly  in Japanese which express the link information in the semanticgraph.
When the more detailed relation between words is needed, the relationalinformation expressed by the relational word is transformed into the compound rela-tion between words such as in Fig.4.
In Fig.4, a relational word "?~?
"(prep.for: used for the purpose of) is transformed into the relation which containssome words ( ' ~  '(use) in this case) and the relation ('object' and 'for thepurpose of ' ) .
In the process of obtaining the semantic graph from a sentence, i tbecomes frequently necessary to supply additional information (expressed by addi-tional words and relations) to the sentence.MAN-ASSISTED MACHINE CONSTRUCTION OF A SEMANTIC DICTIONARY 42~4.
THE FP~AME REPRESENTATION OF A WORD DEFINITIONWhat sorts of information as a meaning of the headword are extracted from thesemantic graph derived from the def in i t ion  sentence in the ordinary Japanese dic-tionary?
In the case of the semantic graph of a word ' i~  (drawing paper)' inFig.3, fol lowing information are extracted, bv means of looking up the upper word'~(paper ) '  of 'drawing paper' and the l inked relat ions between 'paper' and theother words.
@ drawing paper is a kind of paper ,@s l ight ly  thick,  ?white,@usedfor drawing a picture.
These semantic information can be extracted from the seman-t i c  graph of the def in i t ions of a word 'paper' through the views 'a kind o f ' ,' a t t r ibute  (shape)', ' a t t r ibute  (co lor) '  and 'purpose of use'.
Here, 'a kind of 'is a re lat ion between 'drawing paper' and 'paper' .
Furthermore, from@, semanticinformation such that 'drawing paper' is the 'object (place)'  for  drawing a pic-ture' is obtained.
This information denotes case re lat ionship between 'draw' and'drawing paper'.
The above can be understood, from a d i f fe rent  point of view,that the meaning of a word 'drawing paper' is defined (described) from the viewssuch as 'a kind of'  ( re la t ion) ,  ' case ' ( re la t ion) ,  a t t r ibute  (e.g.
shape, color)and 'purpose of use' (basic view point) .
We are aiming at constructing the frameof a word def in i t ion  (cal led the frame of a word or the frame of def in i t ion)  bymeans of these views.
What sorts of views should be prepared for the frame of aword?Concerning the frame we cleared that:(i) Words (to be exact, concepts) are classified into four types, that is, con-crete object, event, attribute (state) and abstract thing which are roughly corres-pond to concrete noun, verb, adjective/adverb and abstract word.
Each word hasthe frame corresponding to its type.
( i i )  The frame is made up of which consist of the semantic relations (such as, akind of relationships, case relationships, cause-effect relationships and whole-parts relationships) and basic views.
As basic views for 'product' thing (a kindof concrete object), we prepared ones shown in table 3.
( i i i )  The frame for 'event' word is mainly made up of case relationships, cause-effect relationships, a kind of relationships and views of 'mode' (e.g.
tense,possibil ity, in progress).
These relationships are shown in tables l and 2.5.
UNIFICATION PROCEDURETo give the fu l l  de f in i t ion  of a word, the part ia l  def in i t ions  given in the form offrames are unif ied into a hierarchical structure by the un i f icat ion procedure.The def in i t ions  of the comparatively upper words in the hierarchical  c lass i f i cat ionof the words should be given f ine meaning while lower words are only given of the i rspecial meanings, because the def in i t ion  inher i ts  from the upper words.
An exampleof the def in i t ion  of a word 'drawing paper' (also, 'paper') is shown in Figs.
5and6, and also the def in i t ion  of a word ' f i re  extinguishing' is shown in Fig.7.
InFigs.5, 6 and 7, the semantic information connected by the dotted l ines areinherited.
In Fig.6, some words (e.g. '
s ta t ionary ' ,  ' instrument' ,  'product')  areskipped between 'paper' and ' th ing ' .
Therefore, i f  these words are looked up andrelated with 'paper' ,  the semantic information extracted from these words shouldbe added to the def in i t ion .
There may be some shortage which can not be suppliedonly by these uni f icat ion procedures, so that i t  should be given man-assistedlyf ine meanings to the comparatively upper words.
For example, in Fig.
~ the agentof 'Remove' is 'Person' and result  of 'remove' is 'vanish' ,  therefore, also theagent of 'ext ingu ish ' ,  ' f i re  extinguishing' and so on can automatical ly be giveni f  we have given the information in the f ine def in i t ion .6.
CONCLUDING REMARKSAlthough, in our prel iminary invest igat ion,  we have prospect o?
using the ordinarydict ionary for the construction of the semantic dict ionary there are many problems422 S. YOSHIDA, H. TSURUMARU and T. HITAKAto be investigated, which contain followings.
(1) Determination of the frames for abstruct noun and attribute(state).
(2) Semantic level of the ~emantic graph.
(3) Definitions of individual thing and event.
(4) Development of the programs and supporting programs.
