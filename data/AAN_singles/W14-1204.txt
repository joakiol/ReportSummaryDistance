However, the impact ofcombining such features with the seman-tics of the text has not yet been studied.
Inthis eye-tracking study with 62 people (31with dyslexia), we explore whether high-lighting the main ideas of the text in bold-face has an impact on readability and com-prehensibility.
We found that highlightingkeywords improved the comprehension ofparticipants with dyslexia.
To the best ofour knowledge, this is the first result of thiskind for people with dyslexia.1 IntroductionDyslexia is a neurological reading disability whichis characterized by difficulties with accurateand/or fluent word recognition as well as by poorspelling and decoding abilities.
These difficultiestypically result from a deficit in the phonologi-cal component of language that is often unrelatedto other cognitive disabilities.
Secondary conse-quences include problems in reading comprehen-sion and reduced reading experience that can im-pede vocabulary growth and background knowl-edge (International Dyslexia Association, 2011).From 10 to 17.5% of the population in theU.S.A.
(Interagency Commission on LearningDisabilities, 1987) and from 8.6 to 11% of theSpanish speaking population (Carrillo et al., 2011;Jim?enez et al., 2009) have dyslexia.
Even ifdyslexia is also popularly identified with brilliantfamous people, the most frequent way to detecta child with dyslexia is by low-performance inschool (Carrillo et al., 2011).
In Spain, it is es-timated that four out of six cases of school fail-ure are related to dyslexia.1The prevalence of1The percentage of school failure is calculated by thedyslexia and its impact in school failure are themain motivations of our work.Previous eye-tracking studies with people withdyslexia have shown that their reading perfor-mance can improve when the presentation of thetext contains certain font types (Rello and Baeza-Yates, 2013) or font sizes (O?Brien et al., 2005;Dickinson et al., 2002; Rello et al., 2013c).Keywords ?
or key-phrases2?
are words thatcapture the main ideas of a text.
Highlighting key-words in the text is a well known strategy to sup-port reading tasks (Weinstein and Mayer, 1986).In fact, highlighting keywords is recommended tostudents with dyslexia (Hargreaves, 2007), as wellas to teachers for making texts more accessible forthis target group (Peer and Reid, 2001).Here, we present the first study which exploresthe modification of the text presentation in rela-tionship with its semantics, by highlighting key-words.
We measure the impact of highlighting thetext on the reading performance (readability andcomprehensibility) of people with dyslexia usingeye-tracking.
Our hypotheses are:?
H1: The presence of highlighted keywords inthe text increases readability for people withdyslexia.?
H2: The presence of highlighted keywords inthe text increases comprehensibility for peo-ple with dyslexia.Next section reviews related work, while Sec-tion 3 explains the experimental methodology.Section 4 presents the results, which are discussedin Section 5.
In Section 6 we draw the conclusionsand we mention future lines of research.number or students who drop school before finishing sec-ondary education (high school).
While the average of schoolfailure in the European Union is around 15%, Spain hasaround 25-30% of school failure, 31% in 2010 (Enguita etal., 2010).2We use ?keywords?, meaning also ?key-phrase?, to referto both single words or phrases that are highlighted.302 Related WorkRelated work to ours can be found in: (1) naturallanguage processing (NLP) literature about key-phrase and keyword extraction (Section 2.1), and(2) accessibility literature about dyslexia and key-words (Section 2.2).2.1 Key-phrase and Keyword ExtractionThere is a vast amount of NLP literature on key-phrase extraction (Kim et al., 2010; Witten et al.,1999; Frank et al., 1999).The semantic data provided by key-phrase ex-traction can be used as metadata for refining NLPapplications, such as summarization (D?Avanzoand Magnini, 2005; Lawrie et al., 2001), textranking (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), indexing(Medelyan and Witten, 2006), query expansion(Song et al., 2006), or document management andtopic search (Gutwin et al., 1999).The closest work to ours is (Turney, 1999) be-cause they highlight key-phrases in the text to fa-cilitate its skimming.
They compare the highlight-ing outputs of two different systems, Search 97and GenEx, using six corpora belonging to differ-ent genre.2.2 AccessibilityIn accessibility and education literature, highlight-ing keywords is a broadly recommended learningstrategy (Weinstein and Mayer, 1986).
Regardingstudents with dyslexia, teachers are encouraged tohighlight keywords to make texts more accessible(Peer and Reid, 2001; Hargreaves, 2007).
Theserecommendations are based on qualitative analy-sis and direct observations with students.In the applications for people with dyslexiahighlighting is used not for keywords or mainideas but to help users for tracking their positionwhen reading such as in ScreenRuler (ClaroSoft-ware, 2012).
Sometimes highlighting is usedsimultaneously with text-to-speech technology(Kanvinde et al., 2012; ClaroSoftware, 2012).
Inthe SeeWord tool for MS Word (Dickinson et al.,2002; Gregor et al., 2003), highlighting is usedon the letters where people with dyslexia normallymake mistakes in order to attract the user?s atten-tion.Previous studies similar to ours have usedeye-tracking to show how people with dyslexiacan read significantly faster as using certain fonttypes (Rello and Baeza-Yates, 2013) or font sizes(O?Brien et al., 2005; Dickinson et al., 2002; Relloet al., 2013c).2.3 What is Missing?First, we did not find any study that measured ob-jectively the impact of highlighting keywords in atext on the readability and comprehensibility forpeople with dyslexia.
Second, to the best of ourknowledge, there are no studies in assistive tech-nology that uses an NLP based engine to high-light keywords for people with dyslexia.
In thiswork we address the first issue, taking the sec-ond one into consideration.
Hence, we emulatedin the experiment the output that a potential NLPtool would give for highlighting the main ideas inthe text.3 MethodologyTo study the effect of keywords on readability andcomprehensibility of texts on the screen, we con-ducted an experiment where 62 participants (31with dyslexia) had to read two texts on a screen,where one of them had the main ideas highlightedusing boldface.
Readability and comprehensibilitywere measured via eye-tracking and comprehen-sion tests, respectively.
The participants?
prefer-ences were gathered via a subjective ratings ques-tionnaire.3.1 DesignIn the experiment there was one condition, Key-words, with two levels: [+keywords] denotes thecondition where main ideas of the text were high-lighted in boldface and [?keywords] denotes thecondition where the presentation of the text wasnot modified.The experiments followed a within-subjects de-sign, so every participant contributed to each ofthe levels of the condition.
The order of the condi-tions was counter-balanced to cancel out sequenceeffects.When measuring the reading performance ofpeople with dyslexia we need to separate readabil-ity3from comprehensibility4because they are notnecessarily related.
In the case of dyslexia, textsthat might seen not readable for the general popu-lation, such as texts with errors, can be better un-derstood by people with dyslexia, and vice versa,3The ease with which a text can be read.4The ease with which a text can be understood.31people with dyslexia find difficulties with standardtexts (Rello and Baeza-Yates, 2012).To measure readability we consider two depen-dent variables derived from the eye-tracking data:Reading Time and Fixation Duration.
To measurecomprehensibility we used a comprehension scoreas dependent variable.?
Fixation Duration.
When reading a text, theeye does not move contiguously over the text,but alternates saccades and visual fixations,that is, jumps in short steps and rests on partsof the text.
Fixation duration denotes howlong the eye rests on a single place of thetext.
Fixation duration has been shown to bea valid indicator of readability.
According to(Rayner and Duffy, 1986; Hy?on?a and Olson,1995), shorter fixations are associated withbetter readability, while longer fixations canindicate that the processing load is greater.On the other hand, it is not directly propor-tional to reading time as some people mayfixate more often in or near the same pieceof text (re-reading).
Hence, we used fixationduration average as an objective approxima-tion of readability.?
Reading Time.
The total time it takes a par-ticipant to completely read one text.
Shorterreading durations are preferred to longerones, since faster reading is related to morereadable texts (Williams et al., 2003).
There-fore, we use Reading Time, that is, the timeit takes a participant to completely read onetext, as a measure of readability, in additionto Fixation Duration.?
Comprehension Score.
To measure text com-prehensibility we used inferential items, thatis, questions that require a deep understand-ing of the content of the text.
We usedmultiple-choice questions with three possi-ble choices, one correct, and two wrong.
Wecompute the text comprehension score as thenumber of correct answers divided by the to-tal number of questions.?
Subjective Ratings.
In addition, we askedthe participants to rate on a five-point Likertscale their personal preferences and percep-tion about how helpful the highlighted key-words were.3.2 ParticipantsWe had 62 native Spanish speakers, 31 with a con-firmed diagnosis of dyslexia.5The ages of the par-ticipants with dyslexia ranged from 13 to 37, witha mean age of 21.09 years (s = 8.18).
The agesof the control group ranged from 13 to 40, with amean age of 23.03 years (s = 7.10).Regarding the group with dyslexia, three ofthem were also diagnosed with attention deficitdisorder.
Fifteen people were studying or alreadyfinished university degrees, fourteen were attend-ing school or high school, and two had no highereducation.
All participants were frequent readersand the level of education was similar for the con-trol group.3.3 MaterialsIn this section we describe how we designed thetexts and keywords that were used as study mate-rial, as well as the comprehension and subjectiveratings questionnaires.Base Texts.
We picked two similar texts fromthe Spanish corpus Simplext (Bott and Saggion,2012).
To meet the comparability requirementsamong the texts belonging to the same experiment,we adapted the texts maintaining as much as pos-sible the original text.
We matched the readabil-ity of the texts by making sure that the parameterscommonly used to compute readability (Drndare-vic and Saggion, 2012), had the same or similarvalues.
Both texts:(a) are written in the same genre (news);(b) are about similar topics (culture);(c) have the same number of words (158 words):(d) have a similar word length average (4.83 and5.61 letters);(e) are accessible news, readable for the generalpublic so they contained no rare or technicalwords, which present an extra difficulty forpeople with dyslexia (Rello et al., 2013a).
(f) have the same number of proper names (oneper text);5All of them presented official clinical results to provethat dyslexia was diagnosed in an authorized center or hos-pital.
The Catalonian protocol of dyslexia diagnosis (SpeechTherapy Association of Catalonia, 2011) does not considerdifferent kinds of dyslexia.32The Museo Picasso M?laga includes new works of the artist in its permanent collectionThe Andalusian Minister of Culture, Paulino Plata, presented a new reorganization of thepermanent collection of the Picasso Museum that, coinciding with the birth anniversaryof the painter, incorporates a wide selection of works by Pablo Picasso provided by theAlmine and Bernard Ruiz-Picasso Foundation for Art.
Paintings, sculptures and ceramicsfrom different periods and styles compose this set of 43 pieces given for 15 years by thementioned foundation.
The incorporation of these creations assumes, according to theAndalusian Council, a valuable contribution to the permanent collection of theMuseum Picasso M?laga.
In this way, a visitor can now contemplate paintings andsculptures that, for the first time, are exposed in the gallery.SiguienteFigure 1: Example slide used in the experiment.
(g) have the same number of sentences (five pertext) and similar sentence complexity (threesentences per text contain relative clauses);(h) one text has two numerical expressions(Rello et al., 2013b) and the other has twoforeign words (Cuetos and Valle, 1988), bothbeing elements of similar difficulty; and(i) have the same number of highlighted key-phrases.An example of a text used (translation from Span-ish6) is given in Figure 1.Keywords.
For creating the keywords we high-lighted using boldface the words which containedthe main semantic meaning (focus) of the sen-tence.
This focus normally corresponds with thedirect object and contains the new and most rele-vant information of the sentence (Sperber and Wil-son, 1986).
We only focused on the main sen-tences; subordinate or relative clauses were dis-missed.
For the syntactic analysis of the sen-tences we used Connexor?s Machinese Syntax(Connexor Oy, 2006), a statistical syntactic parserthat employes a functional dependency grammar(Tapanainen and J?arvinen, 1997).
We took directobjects parsed by Connexor without correcting theoutput.Comprehension Questionnaires.
For each textwe manually create three inferential items.
Theorder of the correct answer was counterbalancedand all questions have similar difficulty.
An exam-ple question is given in Figure 2.Subjective Questionnaire.
The participants ratedhow much did the keywords helped their reading,6www.luzrello.com/picassoEl texto habla de: ?The text is about:??

The presentation of the texthas an effect on reading speed of people withdyslexia (Kurniawan and Conroy, 2006; Gregorand Newell, 2000).
Therefore, we used a textlayout that follows the recommendations of pre-vious research.
As font type, we chose Arial,sans serif, as recommended in (Rello and Baeza-Yates, 2013).
The text was left-justified, as rec-ommended by the British Association of Dyslexia(British Dyslexia Association, 2012).
Each linedid not exceeded 62 characters/column, the fontsize was 20 point, and the colors used were blackfont with creme background,7as recommended in(Rello et al., 2012).3.4 EquipmentThe eye-tracker used was the Tobii T50 thathas a 17-inch TFT monitor with a resolution of1024?768 pixels.
It was calibrated for each par-ticipant and the light focus was always in thesame position.
The time measurements of the eye-tracker have a precision of 0.02 seconds.

andcontrolled by using a fixed chair.3.5 ProcedureThe sessions were conducted at Universitat Pom-peu Fabra in a quiet room and lasted from 20 to 30minutes.
First, we began with a questionnaire tocollect demographic information.
Then, we con-ducted the experiment using eye-tracking.
Theparticipants were asked to read the texts in silenceand to complete the comprehension tests after eachtext read.
Finally, we carried out the subjective rat-ings questionnaire.4 ResultsNone of the datasets were normally distributed(Shapiro-Wilk test) and neither of them had anhomogeneous variance (Levene test).
Hence, tostudy the effect of Keywords on readability andcomprehensibility we used the Wilcoxon non-parametric test for repeated measures.4.1 Differences between GroupsWe found a significant difference betweenthe groups regarding Reading Time (W =2578.5, p < 0.001), Fixation Duration (W =2953, p < 0.001) and Comprehension Score(W = 1544, p = 0.040).Participants with dyslexia had lower compre-hension scores and longer reading times and fixa-tions than participants from the control group (seeTable 1).4.2 ReadabilityWe did not find a significant effect of Keywordson Reading Time for the participants with dyslexia(W = 210, p = 0.688) and for the participantswithout dyslexia (W = 702.5, p = 0.351).Similarly, there were found no significant ef-fects of Keywords on Fixation Duration for theparticipants with dyslexia (W = 259.5, p =0.688) or without dyslexia (W = 862, p = 0.552).4.3 ComprehensionFor the participants with dyslexia, we found a sig-nificant effect on the Comprehension Score (W =178.5, p = 0.022).
Text with highlighted key-words led to significantly higher comprehensionscores in this target group.For the control group we did not find an ef-fect on the Comprehension Score (W = 740, p =0.155).4.4 Subjective RatingsThe debate of what analyses are admissible forLikert scales ?
parametric or non-parametric tests?is pretty contentious (Carifio and Perla, 2008).
AShapiro-Wilk test showed that the datasets werenot normally distributed.
Hence, we also used theWilcoxon non-parametric test.?
Readability.
We found no significant dif-ferences between the groups regarding howmuch highlighting keywords helped themreading the text (W = 504.5, p = 0.316).Both groups found that keywords can slightlyhelp their reading (x?
= 3, x?
= 3.0, s =1.155)8for the participants with dyslexia,and (x?
= 3, x?
= 2.8, s = 0.966) for thecontrol group.?
Memorability.
We found no significant differ-ences between the groups regarding if high-lighting keywords help to memorize the text(W = 484, p = 0.493).Both agree that keywords help them to re-member the text moderately (x?
= 4, x?
=3.636, s = 1.002) for the participants withdyslexia and (x?
= 4, x?
= 3.450, s = 1.085)for the control group.?
Preferences.
Also, no differences betweengroups were found regarding their prefer-ences in finding highlighted keywords in thetexts (W = 463, p = 0.727).Participants with dyslexia would like to findtexts including highlighted keywords (x?
= 4,x?
= 3.636, s = 1.136), as well as in the con-trol group (x?
= 4, x?
= 3.600, s = 1.057).5 DiscussionRegarding the differences between the groups, ourresults are consistent with other eye-tracking stud-ies to diagnose dyslexia that found statistical dif-ferences (Eden et al., 1994).8We use x?
for the median, and s for the standard devia-tion.34Dependent Variable [+Keywords] [?Keywords ](?

22.35Table 1: Results of the Keywords experiment.5.1 Hypothesis 1Shorter reading times and fixation durations areassociated with better readability (Just and Car-penter, 1980).
Since Keywords had no significanteffect on readability, we cannot confirm H.1: Thepresence of highlighted keywords in the text in-creases readability for people with dyslexia.One possible reason for this is that text presen-tation might only have an impact on readabilitywhen the whole text is modified, not only portionsof it.
Most probably, if one text was presented allin boldface or italics and the other one in roman,significant differences could have been found as in(Rello and Baeza-Yates, 2013) where the effect ofdifferent font styles was evaluated.
Another expla-nation could be that the text might look different towhat the participants were used to see and partic-ipants might need some time to get used to high-lighted keywords in the text before testing read-ability effects.From the content point of view, the fact that thereadability did not change as expected, since thecontent of the text is not modified in any of theconditions.5.2 Hypothesis 2Because participants with dyslexia had a signifi-cantly increase in text comprehension with textshaving highlighted keywords, our findings supportH.2: The presence of highlighted keywords in thetext increases comprehensibility for people withdyslexia.This improvement might be due to the possibil-ity that keywords might help to remember the textbetter.
This is consistent with the pedagogic lit-erature that recommends this strategy for learningand retaining text content (Weinstein and Mayer,1986).5.3 Subjective Perception of KeywordsThe fact that using keywords for learning is ashared strategy for both groups (Weinstein andMayer, 1986), may explain that no significantdifferences between groups were found regard-ing their preference and perception of keywordson readability and memorability.
Also, high-lighted keywords in bold are found in generalschool books, not only in materials for people withdyslexia, so both groups were familiar with theconditions.5.4 LimitationsThis study has at least two limitations.
First, thestudy was performed with a manually annotateddataset.
These annotations were based on the out-put of the Connexor parser.
We have not found anyevaluation of Connexor?s accuracy when parsingsyntactic constituents.
Nevertheless, it has beenobserved that the accuracy for direct objects inSpanish achieves results that varies from 85.7%to 93.1%, depending on the test set (Padr?o et al.,2013).
Second, the participants read only two textsbecause we did not wanted to fatigue participantswith dyslexia.
Now that we have observed thatthey could have read more texts, we will carry outfurther studies with more texts that will incorpo-rate automatic keyword extraction.6 Conclusions and Future WorkOur main conclusion is that highlighted keywordsin the text increases the comprehension by peo-ple with dyslexia.
For the control group no effectswere found.
Our results support previous educa-tional recommendations by adding the analysis ofthe impact of highlighting keywords using objec-tive measures.35These results can have impact on systems thatrely on text as the main information medium.By applying keyword extraction automatically andhighlighting them, digital texts could become eas-ier to understand by people with dyslexia.Future work include the integration of auto-matic keyword extraction and its evaluation usinga larger number of texts.
Also, different strategiesto select keywords will be explored and the com-prehension questionnaires will be enriched com-bining inferential and literal questions.
Futurework also includes testing memorability using ob-jective measures in addition to the subjective re-sponses of the participants.AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to the three anonymous review-ers for their comments and suggestions.
