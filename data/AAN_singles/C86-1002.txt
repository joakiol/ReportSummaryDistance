An Empir ica l ly  Based Approach Towards a System OfSemantic FeaturesCornel ia Zel insky-WibbeltIA I -Eurotra-DMart in~Luther-StraBe 14D-6600 Saarbr~ckenAbst rac tA major problem in a~chine translation is the se-mantic description of lexical units which should bebased on a semantic system that is bot\]l coherentand operationalized to the greatest possibledegree?
This is to guarantee consistency betweenlexical unii~ coded by lexicogral~lers.
This articleintroduces a generating device for achieving well-formed semantic feature expressions.I.
T ntention and procedureEmpirical ~xk  with the verbs of the ES~rpusas well as experience in theoretical semantics, andlast but not least, the consulting of the semanticfeature inventories of other machine translationsystems (MII.~AL, JAPAN, SYSTRAN, SUSY) l~ns resultedin the necessity of an elaboration of the proposalfor semantic features made in EIB-3 (EUROTRA LIN-GUI~YfC SPECIFICATIONS).
These feature inventoriesas well as a large amount of already existing,partly fairly traditional work on semantic featuresystems of linguistics and philosophy (CHAFE,FRIEDRICH, PAIMER, VENDLER) , of informationsciences (DAI~BEI~), and work in the field of cog=nitive linguistics and artificial intelligence(G.Ao MI~,  G.A.

JOHNSON-IAIRD, G.LAKOFF, R. LANGACKER, B. COHEN, W.R. GARNER,ATINEAVE, FRED~IKSEN, MINSKY, (~N/AK,  WINOGRAD,ANDERSON & BOWER, WOODS) and last but not leastscme recent issues on word semantics (T. BAIIMER,W.
BRENNENS~IHL, J.BALLWEG, H. FROSCH) have beentaken into account in order to meet the require-merits of a manageable syst~n of semantic features.This system is intended both to be based on asensible theory of semantics and to satisfy thespecial requirements of machine translation ingeneral and of our t~t  type in particular.
More-over, it should be flexible enough to be enlargedand supplemented or changed, whenever this provesnecessary on empirical evidence = this last re-quir~rent being made possible by the accc~plish-ment of the first.In tmying to meet the~ requirea~nts the semanticfeature inventories ~t hand have been enlarged,changed, and adapted to our specific purposes m~dhave been merged into one system of semanticfeatures.2.
Comment on the theoretical asslmi0tions made indifferent machine translation systems withrespect to the semantic representationwith respect to the semantic representation whichin EUROTRA will be implemented on the interfacestructure (IS) level of the source and target lan-guage it is our first and foremost aim to arrive ata coherent system of semantic features.
In ordernot to start from nothing the above mentioned fea-ture inventories have l~en consulted.
The featureinventories developed fer these machine translationsystems have different shortcomings which will bebriefly comm~%ted on in the following.since a sufficient def:hnition of how to interpretthe features is given J/% none of the proposals ofthe above mentioned mac/line translation systems, wewill not ccm~ent here on the ~eatures the~nselvesincluded in the propo~ils.
A brief ccsment, how-ever, is necessary on 'the general approach, whichseems to imply theoretical assumptions (not expli-citly mentioned, since neither a theoretical nor apractical usage-based ~101anation is given) aboutthe organisation and processing of semantic units,for which there is no e~pirical evidence: neithernatural language processing by human beings norefficiency in automatic processing of natural lan-guage gives support to i:~ese implied assumptions.It must be mentioned, however, that this can by nomeans be considered to be an objective comment,since for an outsider, it is ~/~oossible to urger-stand the systematic aDtivation of these featureinventories for at least one of the followingreasons:- The semantic features are not defined or at leastnot sufficiently defJmed in order to n~ke cleartheir conceptual structure and thus to make clearhow they are meant to be used.
This is especiallytrue for the EUROTRA proposal, in ~lich semanticfeatures are not defined at all.
rfhis is, how-ever, only a proposal, which has not been appliedyet, but is being tested at the.
mcment.
But alsothe SYSTRAN semantic features, as well as thoseof JAPAN, which have been worked out rather so-phistieatedly, are not cc~_nted on.
The semanticfeatures of METAL are defined, their definition,however, remains rather vague.
Even when takinginto consideration the ~ les  which are added,the reader does not arrive at a satisfactory un-dersta~.- The dependencies holding between features are.
notexplained.
This is especially true for SYSTRAN,which only gives a list of features z~ferring toarguments.
A hierarchical system consisting oftwo levels of semantic features is defined byMETAL, which is far frc~ sufficient.
JAPAN J sworked out in a more sophisticated way with re-spect to this problem.
Both in METAL and in JA-PAN, however, relations between the dominatingfeatures are not defined.
The ~ proposalgives an enumeration on the second and lowest le~vel of the feature tree, which is just a conglo-n~ration of semantic information, which should bedescribed at different levels~ in order toachieve the overall aim of linguisticallyconsistent semantic description.3.
A proposal for a EUROTRA semantic feature rulesystem3.
i.
Necessity of a semantic feature rule systemLet us now put forward our conception of the ~osystem~ ef ~t ic  features with respect to itsfom~alization.
We have two gr~,  one describing"SITUATION" features, the other one describing"~TITY" features.
Neither of the two systems isstrictly hierarchically organized.
The hierarchicalprinciple, however, which always defines a refine-ment of the doafinat~/~g feattzt~, prevails.
Particu-larly the most general semantic features, such asthe "ENTITY" features "CONC~ETE/"ABSTRACT", "CC~JN-TABLE"/'9~ASS", and "NAIURAL"/"ARTIFICIAL", and the"SITUATION" features "OONCREI~"/"ABSTRAC~", "STA-TIVE"/"DYNAMIC", and "H/NCIUAL"/ "DURATIVE"/"ITE-RATIVE", respectively, form pairs or triplets ofsemantic features.
One feature of each of thesealternations obligatorily occurs, and the descen-dents, which specify them, form disjunct sets.23.2.
The basic formalis~aLet us now comment informally on our present con-ception of how the semantic features which we con-sider necessary so far are related to each ot2ner.We use three operations holding between semanticfeatures in our ?/rammar:l) Hierarc/Iy is the overall relation defining thederivation of the features.2) Alternation relates a set of features, only oneof which applies.3) ~ relates semantic features obligato-rily occurrJ/~g together.
This type of ralation-ship is of course in the minority.The basic idea is to describe these relations by acontext-free ~ule system, where the rules can forexample be of the following, folul~:(3. i) X = (A/B)* (C/D)The h ie r~ ly  here is repz~sented by t/~e sign "=",the alternation by the sign "/", and the disjunc-tion by the sign "*".
The interpretation of therule is the following:The feature on the left handside of the rtlle dc~minates the features appearing o11 the right hand-side?
A, B, C, and D establish a refinement of X.Mere precisely, in this example X is specified by apair of features, the first ~nent  of which canbe either A or B and the .~econd is either C or Do~he subordinate feattlre~ on the right llandside ofthe tulle can get supe~rdinate feature~ themselve~o11 the next level lower dowel in the hie/-archy.
~eterr~inal featuz~s~ t/iat is those features which arenot defined for accepting a/~y ~ulbordinat~ features,are rep ~resented by the rules(3.2) x = 0X = A/0\[~t us exemplify this with the feature "OODNTABIE":(3.3) CODNTABLE~ = CATEGORY 1 * CATEGORY 2 *DEFINITION~ R Y  1 = INDMDUATIVE/P~E/~CATEGORY 2 = CAUSE/RESUI~DEFINITION = MEASURE/SOCIALBy this we mean that the feature "COUNTABLE" isrepresented by three features which always occurtogether (marked by the operator "*").
Each ofthese three features again dfmd/lates a collectionof features only one of which is selected (markedby the operator "/.).
The hierarchical relation-ship itself is implied in the left-to-right-hand-side associations (marked by the operator "=")?Here it is essential to note that every semanticfeatxlre is only defined once by one ruleo If morethan one description exists, all of them are cc~-bined by "or".
As the "and" relation by definitionis prior to the "or" relation, brackets have to beplaced around the alternative expression J.n theopposite case, that is when the "or" relation isprior to the "and" relation.3.3.
The introduction of attributesSo far we have introduced a formal instrtwaent withwhich we can describe the relations be~ fea-tures which are formally possible.
In order to de-scribe the actual relationships between features,this formal\[ instrument still has to be restricted.In order to keep the ru/e system cc~pact, we intro~duced attributes which are intended to describe ~m-portant o~x~zurz~nce restrictions existing betweenfeatures in disjunct bra/ic/%es.
The existe/3c~ of afeature activates an attribute called the derived.This attrik~te effects the restriction of a ruleapplication in a disjunct part of the grammar.There the attribute is called the inherited.
In therule syst~n attri~\]tes appear on the left l~hndsJ.deof the rule if they are derived, on the right har~-side if they are inherited.
We derive a feature'sattribute llke that:(3.4) x\[\] .
.
.
.An attribute always gets the name of the semanticfeature which causes the attribute, so the deriva-tion can be marked by an eanpty pair of squarebrackets.The derived attribute appears in the right-handsidecontext as h~herited attribute e.g.
like that(3.5) Y .
.
.
.
A\[ x\] ..,With the above mentioned example this would look asthe following:(3.6) CAT 2 = CAUSE/RESULTCAUSEr\] = 0~_~_m i\] = oThe inherited attribute can also be assigned to afeature expression.
In this case it ~ould apply toevery feature within this expression.
Moreover, in-stead of a single attribute, an expression of at=tributes can appear.
In an attribute expression theabove mentioned operators "or" and "and" can appearand in addition the n egatien operator "not" (repre-sented by the sign \).
With the introduction of at=tri~mtes the generation mentioned above has to be~odified: the rule (3.4) states that the feature Xis derived and has to be registered so that it canbe used in the relevant disjunct feature contextwhich may also be dcminated by Y as described inru le  (3.5).We have therefore to extend the above mentionedexample (3.6) by the following rule:(3.7) DIREC21ON" -- SOCrRCE \[ CAUSE \]/GOAL \[ RESULT \]with the definition of these ~tles it was provedthat on the one hand the formalism is powerfulenough to ~present all the above mentioned pheno-mena and on the other hand it is still simpleenough so that changes necessary in later stagesmay be accomplished without too much oost.Our rule syste~l is based on the definition of thesemantic features.
So far we have defined 87 f~-tures for the description of "ENTITIES" and 87 lea-tures for the description of "SITUATIONS".3.4?
The use of the formalis~,Our grammar is intend~ to be a generating system.It will be used as inl~it for an automatic proce-dure?
For every lexical unit this can be used togenerate the list of semantic features which se-mantically describe the lexical unit sufficiently.Our notion of sufficiency arises frc~ our goal ofautcmatic disambiguation.
The autcmatic procedureleads the lexicographer through the system in theright way, so that the correct list of semanticfeatures is generated for each lexical entry.
Thisprocedure m~es  use of the rule system in order toproduce menus which show the alternatives valid ineach actual state.
In general the list of sea~nnticfeatures which descrJl~s a lexical unit conta~sonly the terminal features which are generated,since the dominating r~n-terminals can be deduced.%his is, however, not valid for features and theirderivates, which appear on more than one righthandside of a rule (named critical rule), i.e.
theresulting terminal features do not give an unambi-guous specification of the lexical unit.
In thesecases we add the non-terminal feature from the lefthandside of the critical rule to the feature list,which then gives us an adequate feature spectr~.It is, however, possible to take into account re-dundancies by.
taking other dc~tinating features intothe list as well.
This would possibly lead to amore efficient translation process.This output of our g~i~erating systmu will be theil~put to our dictionary and in later stages of thetranslation process, precisely on the interface-structure level, is intented to be used for d i~m-biguation and other strategic purposes in the pro-cess of semantic analysis and synthesis.It follows that all lists of features which can begenerated by the grammar make up the set of allpossible semantic descriptions which may describeconcepts referring to our object world.Moreover, this rule system may be used in synthesisin order to find out dependencies holding betweensemantic features.
We think that this will be ne-cessary for semantic generalizations in the targetlanguage.
~lis dc~k%in, however, has not yet beenworked out.A side effect of the autc~atic processing of therule system is the generation of a graphic repre-sentation which has a i~eelike form.The graphic representation of this rule system hasproved to be very useful.
In this graphic represen-tation the axiem is the root and every rule is re-presented by a subtree as shown in Figure i.If a ~Kx~e generates a derived attribute, an ~ ypair of brackets appears as a subscript of thefeature denoting the node.
If the node inheritsanother attribute or an attribute expression, thecorresponding names or expressions are representedas superscripts of the feature.
Figure 2 representsthe attributes and their effect in an evident way.It makes clear that the order of the disjunctivenodes (branching underneath the "and" node) is mostessential for the application of the attributes.This representation in the form of a tree hasproved to be a very transparent way of illustratingthe structure of the set of semantic features.

The linguistic motivation for the specific make-up of ottr rule system of semantic featuresNow that we have given a description of the for ~realism that we have made use of in order to de-scribe the existing relationships between seman-tic features, let us explain at this point, why se-mantic features are organized like that, since itis less the formalism, but rather empirical evi-dence and linguistic knowledge by means of which wearrive at exactly this organization.Although it is essential to know that there are 9oinherent but only context-dependent features ~,apart frc~ the features "NAqXJRAL" and "ARTIFXCIAL",the basis of our system of semantic features is anas objective as possible a definition of each fea-ture itself.
This definition is based on the crite~ria of prototypicality by means of which we ab-stract fro~ our experience.
Moreover, the criteriaof prototypicality resulted in disjunct and alter-native feature sets, which are described by ourgenerative rule system.
This means that the wholesystem is based on how we categorize concepts.
Thegeneral process of refinement into different sub-features on which our systems are based depends onthe principle of focusing d i f f~t  areas of thesuperconcept and thus imaging different subconcepts?As one general characteristic of the system we sta-ted above that the alternative branchings are inthe majority, since in most cases the system de-fines a refinement of strpex~rd/nate features intosubordinate features.
As the other general charac-teristic we stated the disjunctive branchinq of theroot node.
We can explain this "and" relationshipbetween the dominating features of the system byhow we conceive of our environment.
According togestalt psychology this proceeds at least accordingto the following two principles holding for theperception of "~glTITKS" and "SI~JATIONS" respec-tively.
These two principles correspond to the"and" relationships dominated by the root.On the one hand the definition of concepts dependson whether our oonceptualization of "D~ITITES" or"SIZ~IKTIONS" is based more or less directly or in-directly on our sensory perception.
~he former casein which concepts are abstracted directly on thebasis of sensory perception holds for "CONCRETES",the latter case ~f //xlirect cor~izat ion  holdsfor "A~STRACTS".In the case of "CONCRETES" no higher order infor-mation processing takes plaoe, because there are noparts for which an elaborate substructure has to bereconstructed.
Moreover the peroeptual propertiesremain fairly constant between exemplars, so thatthey are easy to reidentify.
Just the oppositeholds for "A~STRACT,' conoepts.On the other hand we either define concept~ bytheir outlines or by their inner configuration, u10In the former case, in which ~ definition dependson the more or less sharp entlines of the "ENTI-TIES" or "SITUATIONS", we conceptualize "COUN-TABLES" in "the case of "ENTITIES".
In the case of"SITUATIONS" we conceptual ize "PERFECTIVE""ACTIONS" or "EVICTS", that means, either "SITUA-TIONS" for which a terminal phase is expected,which holds for " A ~ ~ " ,  or "SITLrATIONS"which are just in ~he terminal ~hase, which holdsfor "AfXTfEVF24ENTS" and "EVENTS".
u In this case thebou~azy of the cencept can be defined in ~ ofa terminal ~ in t  or phase of the situation.In the lat t~ case in which the ~/tlines are indis-tinct, we define "~NTIRT_ES" by means of their innerconf igurat ion as d i f ferent  subcategor ies of"MASS".
Correspondingly we define "SITUATIONS" asdifferent subcategories of "IMPERFFL~IVES", if thesituation is focused without reference to its ter-minal point or phase, that means as either ',ACTI-VITY" or "PROCESS" respectively or as "STATIVE".The third 'Uand" relationship of our rule systemscannot be explained by the same cognitive principleboth for ,'F/qTITIES" and "SITUATIONS", though it isobligatory for both.
Only the obligatoriness of thesituational "and" relationship can be made evidentby cognitive principles.
This third "and" relation-ship of "SITUATIONS" is the perception of theirprocedur~l c/qaracteristic~, which is precisely the"AETIONSAEI'"o Depending on whether it is "VUNCILrAL"or "DURATIOn" or " ~ " ,  the 'IAktionsart" cc~bines in a definite way with aspect, which can ei-ther be "P~RFECTIVE" or "IMPERFECrlI~".
Now, both"PERFECIXV~;" and " ~ "  can take the sub-category "CAUSATIVE" whereas the other subcatogo-ties of both aspects branch into disjunct featuresets, the refinement being defined by the "is" re-lationship and by the iltheritance of attributes.Here the manifold branching of the "PERFECTIVE" as-pect into "M\[~ATIVE", "INONOATIVERE","REVERSATIVE","~T IV~\ ] "  and also "CAUSATIVE" and the inheri-tarK~ of the semantic featttre~ "AC~T" ,  "AC-COMPLISHMENI~ 'o, and 0'EV~qT ?'
are remarkable, whereasthe "IMPERFEClUS~" aspect, apart frcm the possibi-lity of taking the subcategory "CAUSATIVE" onlyinherits the features "PROCESS", "ACTIVITY" and"STATIVE".
'P~is is the reason for sympathizing withGAIIDON (1964.140f.
), who pleads for considering the',PERFECTIVE" as the unmarked aspect since it "re-presents our normal scheme of arranging our per-ceptions".
In using the "IMPERFELTIVE" we create anartificial stability by stopping the procedure ofsituations and thus making them timeless, whereasthe procedural arrangement within time is usuallyconsidered as the urmmrked case of "SIEUATIONS".with "~rrl~ES" the third "and" relationship whichbranches frcm the root of our grmmmu: is the al-ternation between "NA_~URAL$" and "ART~FICIAIS".We have thus shown how on the basis of empiricalwork two sFstems have grown independently of oneanother, one for "ENTITY" features and one for, 'S~ON"  features, which both have the same num-bet of disjunctive ar~ descending from the rootnode.
And what is even more interesting and corro-borates our systems is the fact that two of thethree disjunctive arcs of both systems can be ex-plained by the same c?~/nitive principles, whichalso are obligatory in the process of oonceptuali-zation.Notes1.
I want to express special thanks to AngelikaMUELIER-v.-BROCHOWSKY for programming the granmmrand for valuable suggestions.2.
This conclusion is not our private impression.A look into the literature on semantic feature net-works shows that they are generally organized likethis: the daRinating ncx~es of the network are re-lated by disjunction, whereas the features lowerdown in the network a~i~ rather related by alterna-tion; that is, they are more strictly hierarchi-cally organized (cf.
e.g.
WOODS 1975)3.
Especially in order to cope with the manifoldsemantic problems when coding lexical units onecannot ignore this fact.
BARSALOU (1982) has testedand verified the existence of two types ofconcepts: context-independent and context-dependentconcepts associated with verbal expressions.
Theresults of his investigation make him conclude,that context-dependent properties have a major rolein the definition and c~tablishment of meaning, asthey are also responsible for changes in theaccessibility of context-independent properties(cf.
ebd.
p.92).4.
This definition of "CONCRETE" ~atches theGIBSONIAN theory of "di~.x~t" perception?5.
This principle again holds for "ENTITIES" and"SITUATIONS" respectively.
Among "ENTITIES", thereare e.g.
tables, books, knives, wars for which wecan image rather definite and clear outlines, bymeans of which they are limited against theirenvirorm~nt, either as "OONCRETES" by a definitelyshaped limitation of ~m~terial or as "ABSTRACTS" bythe limitation of a definite phase structllre of a"PROCESS" or "ACTION".
In English the possibilityof pluralization indicates that thus cencept~lizedentities are "COUNTABI~.~,,.
Among situations thereare "DYNAMIC" "SITUATIONS" like She wrote a letteryesterday or The avalanche rol led down themountain, which are also imaged as having adefinitely limited phase structure, that means as a"PROCESS" or "ACTION" occurring in a definite orderand ending in a definite, i.e.
expected way.
~lisshould explain how we :hnage "CCLRqTABLE" "ENTITIES"and "DYNAMIC" situations by the same cognitiveprinciple.The opposite of such a def inite and sharpl imitat ion towards the environment is theimagination of an amorphous mass, which is lessprecisely defined for its inner configuration andthus not at all for any def in i te ly shapedlimitation.
'ITLis is the case with '%~ASS" entitieslike the "CONCRETE" sL~0stances water and o~ or11abstract "S I~ JA~"  like information, inflation?This is also the case with "ACTIVITIES" and"PI%0CKNS~" like Yesterdaff sh__@e Dainted or The mastwas shaking in the wind and even more so wit2~"STA~IVES" like During the week she e~ u_D a_tseven or This mast shakes ~ the wind.6.
