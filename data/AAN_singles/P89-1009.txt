ukABSTRACTThis paper describes the referring expressiongeneration mechanisms used in EPICURE, a com-puter program which produces natural languagedescriptions of cookery recipes.
Major features ofthe system include: an underlying ontology whichpermits the representation f non-singular entities;a notion of diacriminatory power, to determinewhat properties hould be used in a description;and a PATR-like unification grammar to producesurface linguistic strings.INTRODUCTIONEPICURE (Dale 1989a, 1989b) is a natural lan-guage generation system whose principal concernis the generation of referring expressions whichpick out complex entities in connected iscourse.In particular, the system generates natural lan-guage descriptions of cookery recipes.
Given a toplevel goal, the program first decomposes that goalrecursively to produce a plan consisting of oper-ations at a level of detail commensurate with theassumed knowledge of the hearer.
In order to de-scribe the resulting plan, EPICURE then modelsits execution, so that the processes which producereferring expressions always have access to a rep-resentation of the ingredients in the state they arein at the time of description.This paper describes that part of the systemresponsible for the generation of subsequent refer-ring expressions, i.e., references to entities whichhave already been mentioned in the discourse.
Themost notable features of the approach taken hereare as follows: (a) the use of a sophisticated un-derlying ontology, to permit the representation fnon-singular entities; (b) the use of two levels of se-mantic representation, i  conjunction with a modelof the discourse, to produce appropriate anaphoricreferring expressions; (c) the use of a notion of dis-crimiaatory power, to determine what propertiesshould be used in describing an entity; and (d) theuse of a PATR-1ike unification grammar (see, for ex-ample, Karttunen (1986); Shieber (1986)) to pro-duce surface linguistic strings from input semanticstructures.THE REPRESENTATION OFINGREDIENTSIn most natural anguage systems, it is assumedthat all the entities in the domain of discourse aresingular individuals.
In more complex domains,such as recipes, this simplification is of limitedvalue, since a large proportion of the objects wefind are masses or sets, such as those describedby the noun phrases two ounces of salt and threepounds of carrots respectively.In order to permit the representation f enti-ties such as these, EPICURE makes use of a notionof a generalized physical object or physob\].
Thispermits a consistent representation f entities irre-spective of whether they are viewed as individuals,masses or sets, by representing each as a knowledgebase entity (KBE) with an appropriate structure at.tribute.
The knowledge base entity correspondingto three pounds of carrots, for example, is thatshown in figure 1.A knowledge base entity models a physobj in aparticular state.
An entity may change during thecourse of a recipe, as processes are applied to it:in particular, apart from gaining new propertiessuch as being peeled, chopped, etc., an ingredient'sstructure may change, for example, from set tomass.
Each such change of state results in thecreation of a new knowledge base entity.
Suppose,for example, a grating event is applied to our threepounds of carrots between states so and sl: theentity shown in figure i will then become a mass ofgrated carrot, represented in state sl by the KBEshown in figure 2.BUILDING A REFERRINGEXPRESS IONTo construct a referring expression correspondingto a knowledge base entity, we first build a deep se-68KBE -~indus = ZOstate = sostructure = setquantity = \[ num~erUnit = pound= 3 \]speC = structure = indiv idualsubstance = carrot - , - -  \[ \] packaging = ehape= carrot?

We callthis the recoverable semantic content, since it con-sists of just that information the hearer shouldbe able to derive from the corresponding utter-ance, even if that information is not stated explic-itly: in particular, elided elements and instances ofoae-anaphora are represented in the deep seman-tic structure by their more semantically completecounterparts, as we will see below.From the deep semantic structure, a surfacesemantic structure is then constructed.
Unlike thedeep semantic structure, this closely matches thesyntactic structure of the resulting noun phrase,and is suitable for passing directly to a PATR-likeunification grammar.
It is at the level of surfacesemantic structure that processes such as elisionand one-anaphora take place.PRONOMINAL IZAT IONWhen an entity is to be referred to, we first checkto see if pronominalisation is possible.
Some pre-vious approaches to the pronominalization deci.don have taken into account a large number ofcontextual factors (see, for example, McDonald(1980:218-220)).
The approach taken here is rel-atively simple.
EPICURE makes use of a discoursemodel which distinguishes two principal compo-nents, corresponding to Grosz's (1977) distinctionbetween local focus and global focus.
We call thatpart of the discourse model corresponding to thelocal focus cache memory: this contains the lex-ical, syntactic and semantic detail of the currentutterance being generated, and the same detail forthe previous utterance.
Corresponding to globalfocus, the discourse model consists of a numberof hierarchically-arranged focua spaces, mirroringthe structure of the recipe being described.
Thesefocus spaces record the semantic content, but notthe syntactic or lexlcal detail, of the remainderof the preceding discourse.
In addition, we makeuse of a notion of discourse centre: this is intu-itively similar to the notion of centering suggestedby (\]ross, Joshi and Weinstein (1983), and corre-sponds to the focus of attention in the discourse.In recipes, we take the centre to be the result of69the previous operation described.
Thus, after anutterance like Soak the butterbeaa.s the centre isthe entity described by the noun phrase the but-terbeans.
Subsequent references to the centre canbe pronominalized, so that the next instruction inthe recipe might then be Drain and dnse tltem.Following Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein (1983),references to other entities present in cache mem-ory may also be pronominalized, provided the cen-tre is pronominalized.
1If the intended referent is the current centre,then this is marked as part of the status infor-mation in the deep semantic structure being con-structed, and a null value is specified for the struc-ture's descriptive content.
In addition, the verbcase frame used to construct he utterance speci-fies whether or not the linguistic realization of theentity filling each case role is obligatory: as wewill see below, this allows us to model a commonlinguistic phenomenon in recipes (recipe conteztempty objects, after Massam and Roberge (1989)).For a case role whose surface realization is obliga-tory, the resulting deep semantic structure is thenas follows:D$ =i nde :  : :\[ N~en = +statttm : e.cntrs : tsem : oblig -~ +"Pec = \[ "PC=q)  IThis will be realized as either a pronoun or anelided NP, generated from a surface semantic struc-ture which is constructed in accordance with thefollowing rules:?
If the status includes the features \[centre, +\]and \[oblig, +\], then there should be a cor-responding element in the surface semanticstructure, with a null value specified for thedescriptive content of the noun phrase to begenerated;t We do not permit  pronominal reference to entit ies lastment ioned before the previous utterance: support  for thisrestriction comes from a study by Hobbs, who, in a sam-ple of one hundred consecutive ~.amples of pronouns fromeach of three very different texts, found that  98% of an-tecedents were either in the same or previous sentence(Hobbs 1978:322-323).
However, see Dale (1988) for a sug-gestion as to how the few instances of/onc-dbt~a.e pronom-inalimtion that  do exist might be explained by means  of atheory of discourse structure like that  suggested by Grossand Sidner (1986).7O?
I f  the status includes the features \[centre, +\]and \[oblig,-\], then this participant shouldbe omitted from the surface semantic struc-ture altogether.In the former case, this will result in a pronominalreference as in Remove them, where the surface se-mantic structure corresponding to the pronominalform is as follows:i nd~z  = zs ta tus  : \[SS ="1g iven  = + |J centre = ~r oblig = +\[ nu~ = pl agr8p~ ~--- C CG$~ = GCC&*c  =However, if the participant ismarked as non-obligatory,then reference to the entity is omitted, as in thefollowing:Fry the onions.Add the garlic ~b.Here, the case frame for add specifies that the in-direct object is non-obllgatory; since the entitywhich fills this case role is also the centre, thecomplete prepositional phrase to the onions canbe elided.
Note, however, that the entity corre-sponding to the onions still figures in the deepsemantic structure; thus, it is integrated into thediscourse model, and is deemed to be part of thesemantic ontent recoverable by the hearer.FULL  DEF IN ITE  NOUN PHRASEREFERENCEIf pronominalization is ruled out, we have to buildan appropriate description of the intended refer-ent.
In EPICURE, the process of constructing adescription is driven by two principles, very likeGricean conversational maxims (Grice 1975).
Thep~'nciple of adequacy requires that a referring ex-pression should identify the intended referent un-ambiguously, and provide sufficient information toserve the purpose of the reference; and the princi-ple of e~ciency, pulling in the opposite direction,requires that the referring expression used mustnot contain more information than is necessary forthe task at hand.
2These principles are implemented in EPICUItE2Similar considerations are discussed by Appelt  (1985).DS ~---inde= ..~ =status =.

Sup-pose that we have a set of entities U such thatU = {z l , z2 , .
.
.
, x ,}and that we wish to distinguish one of these en-tities, zl, from all the others.
Suppose, also, thatthe domain includes a number of attributes (a I, a~,and so on), and that each attribute has a numberof permissible values {v,,t, v,,2, and so on}; andthat each entity is described by a set of attribute-value pairs.
In order to distinguish z~ from theother entities in U, we need to find some set ofattribute-value pairs which are together true of zl,but of no other entity in U.
This set of attribute-value pairs constitutes a distinguishing descriptior,of xl with respect to the ,~ontext U.
A mini-mal distinguishing description is then a set of suchattribute-value pairs, where the cardinality of thatset is such that there are no other sets of attribute-value pairs of lesser cardinality which are sufficientto distinguish the intended referent.We find a minimal distinguishing descriptionby observing that different attribute-value pairsdiffer in the effectiveness with which they distin-guish an entity from a set of entities.
SupposeU has N elements, where N > I.
Then, anyattribute-value pair true of the intended referentzl will be true of n entities in this set, wheren >_ i.
For any attribute-value pair < a, v > thatis true of the intended referent, we can computethe discriminatory power (notated here as F) ofthat attribute-value pair with respect to U as fol-lows"~'(< ~,v>, U) = ~-'~ l<n<NF thus has as its range the interval \[0,1\], wherea value of 1 for a given attribute-value pair indi-cates that the attribute-value pair singles out theintended referent from the conte?t, and a value of7\]DS -~-i ndez  = z2s ta tus  =SSf~tSpSC -~\[ #/uen= + \]unique = +number  = sgagr  = countab le  ---- +type  =\]categor l !

3 Thereremains the question of how the constituency ofthe set U of entities is determined: in the presentwork, we  take the context always to consist of theworking set.
This is the set of distinguishable enti-sstrictly speaking, this mechanism is only applicable inthe form described here to those properties of an entitywhich are realizable by what are known as abJolute (or t~-tereect/ee or pred~tiee) adjectives (see, for example, Kamp(1975), Keenan and FaRm (1978)).
This is acceptable inthe current domain, where many of the adjectives used arederived from the verbs used to describe processes appliedto entities.ties in the domain at any given point in time: theconstituency of this set changes as a recipe pro-ceeds, since entities may be created or destroyed.
4Suppose, for example, we  determine that wemust identify a given object as being a set of oliveswhich have been pitted (in a context, for example,where there are also olives which have not beenpitted}; the corresponding deep semantic struc-ture is then as in figure 3.Note that this deep semantic structure canbe realized in at least two ways: as either theolives which have been pitted or the pitted olives.4A slightly more sophisticated approach would be torestrict U to exclude those entities which are, in G rosz andSidner's (1986) terms, only present in closed focus spaces.However, the benefit gained from doing this (if indeed it is avalid thing to do) is minimal in the current context becauseof the small number of entities we are dealing with.72i ndez  = z~tat t~ = .\[ \]number = plagr = "ountable = +DS = ~.nuant8pec =8ubst  =\]t number--- 3 \]agr = countable = +tltpe -- categorlt = pound \]number = pl lagr = countable = + Jtype = category = carrot \]JFigure 7: The deep semantic structure corresponding to three pounds of carrotsBoth forms are possible, although they correspondto different surface semantic structures.
Thus,the generation algorithm is non-deterministic inthis respect (although one might imagine there areother factors which determine which of the two re-alizations is preferrable in a given context}.
Thesurface semantic structure for the simpler of thetwo noun phrase structures is as shown in figure 4.ONE ANAPHORAThe algorithms employed in EPICURE also permitthe generation of onc-anaphora, as inSlice the large green capsicum.Now remove the top of the small red one.The deep semantic structure corresponding to thenoun phrase the small red one is as shown in fig-ure 5.The mechanisms which construct the surfacesemantic structure determine whether one-anaphorais possible by comparing the deep semantic struc-ture corresponding to the previous utterance withthat corresponding to the current utterance, toidentify any elements they have in common.
Thetwo distinct levels of semantic representation playan important role here: in the deep semantic struc-ture, only the basic semantic category of the description has special status (this is similar to Wel>-her's (1979) use of restricted quantification), whereasthe embedding of the surface semantic structure'sdcsc feature closely matches that of the noun phraseto be generated.
For one-anaphora to be possi-ble, the two deep semantic structures being com-pared must have the same value for the featureaddressed by the path <sere spec type category>.Rules which specify the relative ordering of ad-jectives in the surface form are then used to buildan appropriately nested surface semantic structurewhich, when unified with the grammar, will resultin the required one-anaphoric noun phrase.
In thepresent example, this results in the surface seman-tic structure in figure 6.PSEUDO-PARTIT I 'VE  NPSPartitive and pseudo-partitive noun phrases, ex-emplified by half  of  the carrots and three pounds ofcarrots respectively, are very common in recipes;EPICURE is capable of generating both.
So, forexample, the pseudo-partitive noun phrase threepounds of carrots (as represented by the knowledgebase entity shown in figure 1) is generated from thedeep semantic structure shown in figure 7 via thesurface semantic structure shown in figure 8.The generation of partitive noun phrases re-quires slightly different semantic structures, de-scribed in greater detail in Dale (1989b).THE UNIF ICAT ION GRAMMAROnce the required surface semantic structure hasbeen constructed, this is passed to a unification73$S =ind .= = zatatua=8eraepee =.

In EPICURE, the grammar consists ofphrase structure rules annotated with path equa-tions which determine the relationships betweensemantic units and syntactic units: the path equa-tions specify arbitrary constituents (either com-plex or atomic) of feature structures.There is insufficient space here to show the en-tire NP grammar, but we provide some representa-tive rules in figure 9 (although these rules are ex-pressed here in a PATR-Iike formalism, within EPI-CURE they are encoded as PROLOG definite clausegrammar (DCG) rules (Clocksin and Mellish 1981)).Applying these rules to the surface semantic struc-tures described above results in the generation ofthe appropriate surface linguistic strings.CONCLUSIONIn this paper, we have described the processes usedin EPICURE to produce noun phrase referring ex-pressions.
EPICURE is implemented in C-PROLOGrunning under UNIX.
The algorithms used in thesystem permit the generation of a wide range ofpronominal forms, one-anaphoric forms and fullnoun phrase structures, including partitives andpseudo-partitives.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe work described here has benefited greatly fromdiscussions with Ewan Klein, Graeme Ritchie, :IonOberlander, and Marc Moens, and from BonnieWebber's encouragement.REFERENCESAppelt, Douglas E.
