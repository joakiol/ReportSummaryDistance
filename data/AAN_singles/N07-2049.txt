Analysis shows that story boundariescannot be clearly discriminated from utteranceboundaries by speaker-normalized pitch resetdue to its large variations across different syl-lable tone pairs.
Instead, speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset can provide a clear sep-aration between utterance and story bound-aries.
Experiments using decision trees forstory boundary detection reinforce that raw andspeaker-normalized pitch resets are not effec-tive for Mandarin Chinese story segmentation.Speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset is agood story boundary indicator.
When it is com-bined with pause duration, a high F-measureof 86.7% is achieved.
Analysis of the decisiontree uncovered four major heuristics that showhow speakers jointly utilize pause duration andpitch reset to separate speech into stories.1 IntroductionPitch reset refers to the speaker?s general pitch declina-tion through the course of a speech unit, followed by a re-set to a high pitch at the start of next speech unit, as shownin Figure 1(a).
The speech unit may be of different lev-els of granularity (Tseng et.
al., 2005), such as a speechsegment that conveys a central topic (e.g.
a news story), aprosodic phrase group (PG) or an utterance.
These unitsare often separated by pauses.
Pauses and pitch resetswere shown to be effective story boundary indicators inEnglish broadcast news segmentation (Shriberg et.
al.,2000; Tu?r et.
al., 2001).
These previous efforts specifi-cally point out that pause durations are longer and pitchresets are more pronounced at story boundaries, whencompared to utterance boundaries in English broadcastnews.
However, such story segmentation approaches maybe different for a tonal language such as Mandarin Chi-nese.
The use of similar prosodic features for Chinesenews story segmentation deserves further investigation.The main reason is that Chinese tonal syllables may com-plicate the expressions of pitch resets.
Chinese syllabletones are expressed acoustically in pitch trajectories, i.e,different tones show different pitch value ranges and tra-jectory patterns,1 as shown in Figure 1(b).
Initial work in(Levow, 2004) has shown that Mandarin words at storyending positions show a lower pitch as compared withwords at non-story-ending positions.
In this paper, wepresent a data-oriented study to investigate how the tonal-ity of Mandarin syllables affects pitch resets at utteranceand story boundaries.
To alleviate the effects from tonal-ity, we propose to use speaker- and tone-normalized pitchreset with pause duration to separate Mandarin broadcastaudio stream into distinct news stories.F0 PitchResettSpeechU nit SpeechU nit(a)5 535214515Tone 1 (high) Tone 2 (rising) Tone 3 (low) Tone 4 (falling)4321(b)Figure 1: (a) Pitch reset phenomenon between speechunits; (b) Pitch trajectories for the four Mandarin basicsyllable tones.
The speaker pitch range is segmented tofive zones from high to low.
The pitch trajectories of thefour tones are 5-5, 3-5, 2-1-4 and 5-1, respectively.2 Task and CorpusIn a continuous audio stream of broadcast news, there areprograms that consist of speaker changes among anchors,reporters and interviewees.
Other programs may containa sequence of news stories reported by a single speaker.We focus on the latter kind in this investigation, becausethe combined use of pause duration and pitch reset topunctuate the end of a story and the beginning of the nextcarries many speaker-dependent characteristics.We select a subset of TDT2 VOA Mandarin broadcastnews corpus (LDC, 1998) and manually extract the newssessions reported by a single speaker.
We also annotate1http://www.mandarinbook.net/pronunciation/193Table 1: The TDT2 subset used in this study.NatureMandarin news sessions reportedby a single speaker (13.4 hours)# of NewsSessions175 (Training: 74, Development:50, Testing: 51)Mean SessionDuration276 seconds, 1071 Mandarin char-acters# of StoryBoundaries1085 (Training: 442, Develop-ment: 316, Testing: 327)# of Speakers 11 (7 females and 4 males)Mean StoryDuration36 seconds, 105 Mandarin charac-tersTranscriptions Dragon ASR recognizer, GB-encoded word-level transcriptionsin XML formatthe news story boundaries in this subset.
These single-speaker sessions typically contain between 3 to 9 shortnews stories separated by pauses and constitute about30% of the entire TDT2 Mandarin corpus (by time du-ration).
The selected subset is divided into training, de-velopment and testing sets.
Details are shown in Table 1.3 Region of Interest and Pitch ExtractionPrevious work on English news segmentation (Shriberget.
al., 2000) measured pitch resets at inter-word bound-aries.
Since Chinese news transcripts come as a charac-ter stream and each character is pronounced as a tonalsyllable, it is more reasonable to investigate the pitch re-set phenomenon at the syllable level.
We assume that astory boundary must occur at an utterance boundary.
Theutterances are separated by labeled pauses in the VOAtranscriptions ([P] in Figure 2) and a story may containvarious utterances (between 2 to 38 in the corpus).
There-fore, we only investigate pitch resets in inter-syllable re-gions across two consecutive utterances as shown in Fig-ure 2.
This is reasonable because there are only 6 storyboundaries (out of 1085) that are not signaled by pausebreaks in the corpus.
The region of interest (ROI) is lim-ited to only two tonal syllables, i.e., the last tonal syllableof the previous utterance and the first tonal syllable of thefollowing utterance.
We have performed experiments onwindow length selection and results have shown a widerwindow does not bring a noticeable improvement.Raw pitch values are extracted by the YIN pitchtracker (Cheveigne?
et.
al., 2002).
The output pitch tra-jectories are ranked as ?good?
and ?best?
by the pitchtracker.
Pitch values for unvoiced and pause segments areassigned to be zero.
We keep the ?best?
pitch trajectoriesfor pitch reset measurements.
We focus on pitch resets inthe ROIs and thus obtain pitch contours for the left andright tonal syllables for each ROIs.
However, the corpustranscription does not provide time annotations for thosetonal syllables.
Therefore, in the pitch trajectory of an! "

The two pitch sequences foundare used as the pitch contours for the left and right tonalsyllables of the ROI, respectively.
This approximation isreasonable because a Mandarin tonal syllable usually ex-hibits a continuous pitch contour within its time duration.4 Speaker- and Tone-Normalized PitchReset Analysis in Mandarin BroadcastNewsWe investigate the pitch reset behavior in the ROIs, i.e.,the pitch jump between the left and right tonal syllablesat utterance and story boundaries across all corpus audio.Since pitch is a speaker-related feature, we adopt speaker-normalized pitch reset, defined asPR = F0r ?
F0l, (1)where F0l and F0r are the speaker-normalized pitch forthe left and right tonal syllables in the ROIs, which arecalculated usingF0 = (f0 ?
?sf0)/?sf0 .
(2)f0 denotes the mean value of the pitch contour of a tonalsyllable uttered by speaker s. ?sf0 and ?sf0 are the pitchmean and standard deviation calculated for speaker s overall the ROIs of speaker s in the corpus.We measure the speaker-normalized pitch resets in allROIs, and categorize them into two boundary types, i.e.utterance boundary and story boundary.
To show the ef-fects of tonality in pitch movement, we also categorizethe pitch resets by different tone combinations (16 com-binations for 4 Mandarin tones2).
Figure 3 plots the meanPR of each tone combinations for the two boundarytypes calculated on the corpus data.
We see that the pitchreset phenomenon holds for all tone combinations, evenfor the tone pair (1,3) (i.e.
high, low) that has a very smallreset.
We perform t-tests (p < 0.0025, one-tailed), whichshow that for a given tone pair across a boundary, thereis a significant difference in PR between an utteranceboundary and a story boundary.
However, the PR val-ues vary greatly across different tone pairs.
For example,2The neutral tone is not considered here since its pitch pat-tern depends heavily on its neighboring tonal syllables.194(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4)(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (3,1)(3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (4,1) (4,2)(4,3) (4,4)00.511.522.5StoryB oundaryUtteranceB oundaryToneP airMeanPROverallM ean forStoryB oundaryPROverallM ean forUtteranceB oundaryPRFigure 3: Mean speaker-normalized pitch reset of the 16tone pairs for story and utterance boundaries.pitch resets are reduced for the tone pairs (1,3) and (4,3),but are pronounced for the tone pairs (3,1) and (2,1).
Thet-test (p < 0.0025, one-tailed) shows that the PR differ-ence between utterance boundaries and story boundariesare not significant.
This motivates us to formulate a defi-nition for speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset.The speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset is definedas:PR = F0r ?F0l, (3)where F0l and F0r are the speaker- & tone-normalizedpitch for the left and right tonal syllables in the ROIs,respectively, defined asF0 = (F0 ?
??F0)/?
?F0 , (4)where F0 is the speaker-normalized pitch in Equation (2)of a tonal syllable with tone ?
.
?
?F0 and ?
?F0 are the pitchmean and standard deviation calculated for the tonal syl-lables with tone ?
over all ROIs in the corpus.
Figure 4plots the mean PR of each tone combinations for the twoboundary types calculated on the corpus data.Figure 4 shows a clear separation in speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset (PR) between utterance and storyboundaries (shade area in Figure 4).
This result is sta-tistically significant based on a t-test (p < 0.0025, one-tailed).
This observation suggests that speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset may be an effective story boundaryindicator for Mandarin broadcast news.5 Experiments on Story BoundaryDetectionWe perform experiments on story boundary detection atthe ROIs in the corpus.
Since all ROIs are utteranceboundaries, of which only some are story boundaries, wetake a ?hypothesize and classify?
approach in order tostrike a good balance between recall and precision.
Wefirst hypothesize the occurrence of a story boundary ifthe ROI has a pause duration that exceeds a threshold.This is followed by a decision tree classifier that decideson the existence of a story boundary.
We used Quinlan?sC4.5-style decision tree (Quinlan, 1992) as the classifier,00.511.522.5StoryB oundaryUtteranceB oundaryMeanToneP airOverallM ean??

In each case, we hypothesized raw bound-aries in the training and development sets.
A decision treewas then grown using the raw boundary hypotheses of thetraining set, and tested on the raw boundary hypothesesof the development set.
The pause duration leading to thehighest F-measure on the development set was selectedas the optimal threshold for the further experiments onthe testing set.We develop seven story boundary detectors accordingto the features used (see Table 2).
The boundary de-tection results on the testing set are shown in Table 2.From Table 2, we can see that the detector using pauseduration achieves a high F-measure of 82.2%.
This re-sult is reasonable since VOA Mandarin news broadcastmakes large use of long pauses at story boundaries, es-pecially at news sessions reported by a single speaker.The detector using raw pitch reset (pr = f0r?f0l) onlygets a F-measure of 50.8% and the speaker-normalizedpitch reset (PR) achieves a slightly better F-measure of55.3%.
Speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset (PR)achieves a superior performance with an F-measure of71.1%.
This result is consistent with the observationsin Section 4.
The story boundary indicative ability ofspeaker-normalized pitch reset is affected by the tonal-ity of Mandarin syllable.
Speaker- and tone-normalizedpitch reset can alleviate the effects, thus leading to a bet-ter discrimination.
Based on Table 2, when pause iscombined with raw pitch reset, the F-measure degradesfrom 82.2% to 68.3%.
The F-measure reaches 77.4%when we combine pause with speaker-normalized pitchreset.
When pause is combined with speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset (Pause+PR), the best F-measureis achieved at 86.7%.3http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/projects/bayes-group/ind/195Table 2: Story boundary detection experiment results(%)Feature Recall Precision F-MeasurePause 77.1 88.1 82.2pr 52.0 49.7 50.8PR 56.6 54.1 55.3PR 70.3 72.0 71.1Pause+pr 66.4 70.3 68.3Pause+PR 72.2 83.5 77.4Pause+PR 82.6 91.3 86.7Table 3: Heuristics for story boundary decisionNo.

We can observe the com-plementarity between pause duration and pitch reset instory boundary detection.
This may be summarized interms of four major heuristics shown on the tree (labeledas 1 to 4 in Figure 5).
These heuristics cover about 83%decisions made on the testing set, as described in Table 3.Heuristics 2 is mainly used to detect possibly miss-ing story boundaries with short pauses caused by speakerspeaking style, e.g., reporters Li Weiqing and Yang Chentend to use short pauses to separate news stories, but theytend to offset the reduced pauses with pronounced pitchresets to signify story boundaries.
Heuristics 4 detectspossibly false alarms due to broadcast interruptions inboundary detection.
These interruptions (i.e.
silences)usually occur within a news story and may last for sev-eral seconds (usually > 5 seconds).6 Summary and Future WorkThis paper investigated the combined use of pause dura-tion and pitch reset for automatic story segmentation inMandarin broadcast news.
Pitch reset analysis on Man-darin broadcast news shows that story boundaries cannotbe discriminated from utterance boundaries by speaker-normalized pitch reset, because speaker-normalized pitchreset varies greatly across different tone pairs of boundarysyllables.
This motivates us to investigate the speaker-and tone-normalized pitch reset.

This result shows the difference be-tween English and Chinese.
Previous work for En-glish (Shriberg et.
al., 2000; Tu?r et.
al., 2001) showsthat speaker-normalized pitch reset is effective.
Thiswork shows that the same measurement is not sufficientfor Chinese; instead we need to use speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset in Chinese story segmentation.When pause duration is combined with speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset, the best performance is achievedwith a high F-measure of 86.7%.
Analysis of the deci-sion tree uncovered four major heuristics that show howspeakers jointly utilize pause and pitch reset to separatespeech into stories.Future work will investigate the pitch reset phe-nomenon in Cantonese broadcast news, because Can-tonese is another major Chinese dialect with more com-plicated tonal characteristics.
We also plan to incorporateprosodic cues with lexical cues to further improve perfor-mance in Chinese story segmentation.ReferencesShriberg E., Stolcke A., Hakkani-Tu?r D. and Tu?r G. 2000.Prosody-based automatic segmentation of speech into sen-tences and topics.
