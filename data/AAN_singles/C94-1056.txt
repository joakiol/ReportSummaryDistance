The system firstextracts the rhetorical structure, the compound ofthe rhetorical relations between sentences, and thencuts out less important parts in the extracted struc-ture to generate an abstract of the desired length.Evaluation of the generated abstract showed that itcontains at maximum 74% of the most importantsentences of the original text.
The system is nowutilized as a text browser for a prototypicaI interac-tive document retrieval system.2 INTRODUCTIONAbstract generation is, like Machine Translation, oneof the ultimate goal of Natural Language Process-ing.
IIowever, since conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems(e.g.
\[Kuhn 58\])are lacking in inter-sentential or discourse-structuralanalysis, they are liable to generate incoherent ab-stracts.
On the other hand, conventional knowl-edge or script-based abstract generation systems(e.g.\[behnert 801, \[Fum 86\]), owe their success to the li,n-itation of the domain, and cannot be applied to doc-ument with varied subjects, such ,as popular scientificmagazine.
To realize a domain-independent abstractgeneration system, a computational theory for ana-lyzing linguistic discourse structure and its practicalprocedure must be established.ltobbs developed a theory in which lie arrangedthree kinds of relationships between sentences fromthe text coherency viewpoint \[Hobbs 79\].Grosz and Sidner proposed a theory which ac-counted for interactions between three notions ondiscourse: linguistic structure, intention, and atten-tion \[C, rosz et al 86\].l,itman and Allen described a model in whicha discourse structure of conversation was built byrecognizing a participanUs plans \[Litman et al 87\].
'l'hese theories all depend on extra-linguistic knowl-edge, the accumulation of which presents a problemin the realization of a practical analyzer.Cohen proposed a framework for analyzing thestructure of argumentative discourse \[Cohen 87\], yetdid not provkle a concrete identification procedurefor 'evidence' relationships between sentences, whereno linguistic clues indicate the relationships.
Also,since only relationships between successive sentenceswere considered, the scope which the relationshipscover cannot be analyzed, even if explicit connectivesare detected.Mama and Thompson proposed a linguistic struc-ture of text describing relationships between sen-tences and their relative importance \[Mann et al 87\].llowever, no method for extracting the relationshipsfrom superficial linguistic expressions was describedin their paper.We have developed a computational rnodel ofdiscourse for Japanese xpository writings, and im-plemented a practical procedure for extracting dis-course structure\[Sumita 92\].
In our model, discoursestructure is deiined ,as the rhetorical structure, i.e.,the compound of rhetorical relations between sen-tences in text.
Abstr~t  generation is realized ~s asuitaMe application of the extracted rhetorical struc-ture.
In this paper we describe briefly our discoursemodel and discuss the abstract generation systembased on it.3443 RHETORICA l ,  STRUCTURERhetorical structure represents relations between var-ions chunks of sentences in the body of each section.In this paper, the rhetorical structure is representedby two layers: intra-paragraph and inter-paragral)hstructures.
An intra-paragraph structure is a struc-ture whose representation u its are sentences, and aninter-paragraph structure is a structure whose rep-resentation units are paragraphs.In text, various rhetorical patterns art,.
used toclarify the principle of argument.
Among them, co,>nectivc expressions, which state inter-sentence r la-tionships, are the most significant.
The tyl)ieal grant-matical categories of the connective xpressions areconnectives and sentence predicates.
They can I>cdivided into the thirty four categories which are ex-ernplified in Table 1.Table h Example Of rhetorical relationsRelation Expressionsserial (<SR>)su'n{lnarizatiou(<su>)negative (<NG>)dak'ara (thus)'kh.a.,aOk.,, (after all)shikashi (I)ut)example {<EG>) tatoeba (for example)espeeial(<ES>) tokuni (particuli~rly)re.~son !<aS>) ,mzenara (because)s{ipplcment (<SP>)background (<BI>)parallel (<PA>)exteflsion (<EX>)rei)hra~e (<RF>)direction (<DI>)mochiron (of course)juura i  (hitherto)mata.

is described)The rhetorical relation of a sentence, which isthe relationship to the preceding part of the text.,can be extracted in accordance with the connectiveexpression in the sentence.
For a sentence withoutany explicit connective xl)ressions , extension rela-tion is set to the sentence.
The relations exemplitiedin Table 1 are used for representing the rhetoricalstructure.Fig.
1 shows a paragral)h from an article titled"A Zero-Crossing l{ate Which Estimates the Fre-quency of a Speech Signal," where underlined wordsindicate connective xl)ressions.
Although the fourthand fifth sentences are clearly the exemplificationof the first three sentences, the sixth is not.
Alsothe sixth sentence is the concluding sentence for thefirst five.
Thus, tile rhetorical structure for this textcan be represented by a binary-tree as shown inFig.
2.This structure is also represented as follows:\[ \[\[1 <EZ> 2\] <gs> \[3 <E(\]> \[4 <EX> 5\] \ ] \ ]  <sa> 6\]1: In tile context of discrete-time signals, zero-crossing is said to occur if successive sampleshave dilfereut algebraic signs.2: Tile rate at which zero crossings occur is asimple measure of tile frequency content of stsig,ml.3: This is .particularly true of narrow bandsignals.4: For example, a si,msoidal signal of frequencyP0, sanll)led at a rate fs,  h,'~s i'~/t"~ samplesper cycle of the siue wave.5: Each cycle has two zero crossings o that thehmg-term average rate of zero-crossings isz = 2F0/s ; ; .6: Thus, tile average zero-crossing rate gives areasonable way to estinmte the frequency of asine wave.

Each sub tree of the rhetoricalstructure forms an arg,rnentative constituent, just aseach sub-tree of tile syntactic tree forms a gram,nat-ical constituent.
Also, a sub-tree of the rhetoricalstructure is sub-categorlzed by a relation of its par-ent node as well as a syntactic tree.3455 Implementat ion NoteThe  cur rent  vers ion  of  TEC I IDOC is run -n ing  on  Sun  Spare  s ta t ions  w i th  LUCI \ ] )CommonL ISP  1.4 and  LOOM 1.41 (a por tto LOOM 2.1 is underway) ,  and  a PEN-MAN vers ion  f l 'om 199i .

2, each penalty score is calculated as shown illFig.
3.
In Fig.
3 italic numbers are the penalties thesystem imposed on each node of tile structure, andbroken lines are the boundary between the nodes int--posed different penalty scores.
The figure shows thatsentence four and five have penalty score three, thatsentence three has two , that sentence one and twohave one, and that sentence six has no penalty score.In this ease, the system selects sentence one, two,three and six for the longest abstract, and and alsocould select sentence one, two and six as a shorterabstract, and also could select sentence six as a stillmore shorter abstract.After the sentences to be included in tile al)-stract are determined, the system alter,atcly arrangesthe sentences and the connectives from which the re-lations were extracted, and realizes the text of tileabst r~t .The important feature of the generated abstr,'mtsis that since they are composed of the rhetoriealyconsistent units which consist of several sentencesand form a rhetorical substructure, the abstract doesnot contain fragmentary sentences which can,ot  beunderstood alone.
For example, in the abstract gen-eration mentioned above, seutence two does not al>pear solely in the abstract, but appears ahvays withsentence one.
If sentence two apl)eared alone in theabstract withont sentence one, it wouhl be difficultto understand the text.6 EVALUATIONThe generated abstracts were evaluated from the pointof view of key sentence coverage.
30 editorial articleso f"Asahi  Shinbun", a Japanese newspaper, and 42technical papers of "Toshiba Review", a journal ofToshiba Corp. which publishes hort expository pa-pers of three or four pages, were selected and threesubjects judged tile key sentences and tile most im-portant key sentence of each text.

The re-s , l t  is shown in Table 3.
As for the technical papers,tile average length ratio( abstract/original ) w;~s 24%, and tile coverage of tl,e key sentence and the mostimportant key sentence were 51% and 74% respec-tively.
Whereas, ~s for the editorials, tile averagelength ratio( abstract/original ) was 30 %, and thecoverage of the key sentence and the most importantkey sentence were 41% and 60% respectively.The reason why the compression rate and thekc.y sentence coverage of the technical papers werehigher than that of the editorials is considered asfollows.
The technical papers contains o many rhe-torical expressions in general as to be expository.347That is, they provide many linguistic clues and thesystem can extract the rhetorical structure exactly.Accordingly, the structure can be reduced furtherand the length of the abstract gets shorter, withoutomitting key sentences.
On the other hand, in theeditorials most of the relations between sentences aresupposed to be understood semantically, and are notexpressed rhetorically.
Therefore, they lack linguis-tic clues and the system cannot extract he rhetoricalstructure xactly.Table 3: Key sentence coverage of the abstractscover  ratioMaterial total lengthnum.

The rhetorical structure alsoprovkles the rhetorical relation between the extractedsentences, and can be used to generate appropriateconnectives between them.Abstract generation b~sed on rhetorical struc-ture extraction has four merits.
First, unlike con-ventional word-frequency-based abstract generationsystems(e.g.
\[Kuhn 58\]), the geuerated abstract isconsistent with the original text in that the connec-tives between sentences in the abstract reflect theirrelation in the original text.
Second, once the rhe-torical structure is obtained, varions lengths of gen-erated abstracts can be generated easily.
This can bedone by simply repeating the reduction process untilone gets the desired length of abstract.
Third, un-like conventional knowledge or script-b`ased abstr,~tgeneration systems(e.g.
\[Lehnert 80\], \[Fum 86\]), therhetorical structure extraction does not need pre-pared knowledge or scripts related to the originaltext , aud can be used for texts of any domain , solong as they contain enongh rhetoricM expressionsto be expository writings.
Fourth, the generatedabstract is composed of rhetoriealy consistent unitswhich consist of several sentences and form a rhe-torical substructure, so the abstract does not containfragmentary sentences which cannot be understooda lone .The limitations of the system are mainly dueto errors in the rhetorical structure analysis and thesentence-selection-type abstract generation, the eval-nation of the accuracy of the rhetorical structureanalysis carried out previously( \[Sumita 92\] ) showed74%.
Also, to make the length of the abstract shorter,It, is necessary to utilize an inner-sentence analysisand to realize a phrase-selection-type abstract gen-eration b,~sed on it.
The anaphora-resolution a dthe toplc-sul)l)leineutation must also be realized inthe analysis.The system is now utilized ,as a text browser fora prototypical interactive document retrieval system.References\[Cohen 87\] Cohen, I/.
