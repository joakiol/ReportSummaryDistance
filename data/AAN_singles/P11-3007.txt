I propose to build discrimina-tive SMT models using both tree-to-stringand tree-to-tree approaches.
Translation andlanguage models will be represented mainlythrough the use of Tree Automata and TreeTransducers.
These formalisms have im-portant representational properties that makesthem well-suited for syntax modeling.
I alsopresent an experiment plan to evaluate thesemodels through the use of a parallel corpuswritten in English and Brazilian Portuguese.1 IntroductionStatistical Machine Translation (SMT) has domi-nated Machine Translation (MT) research in thelast two decades.
One of its variants, Phrase-basedSMT (PB-SMT), is currently considered the stateof the art in the area.
However, since the adventof PB-SMT by Koehn et al (2003) and Och andNey (2004), purely statistical MT systems have notachieved considerable improvements.
So, new re-search directions point toward the use of linguisticresources integrated into SMT systems.According to Lopez (2008), there are four stepswhen building an SMT system: translational equiv-alence modeling1, parameterization, parameter esti-mation and decoding.
This Master?s thesis proposalaims to improve SMT systems by including syntac-tic information in the first and second steps.
There-1For the remainder of this proposal, I will refer to this stepas simply translation model.fore, I plan to investigate two approaches: the Tree-to-String (TTS) and the Tree-to-Tree (TTT) models.In the former, syntactic information is provided onlyfor the source language while in the latter, it is pro-vided for both source and target languages.There are many formal theories to representsyntax in a language, like Context-free Gram-mars (CFGs), Tree Substitution Grammars (TSGs),Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) and all its syn-chronous counterparts.
In this work, I represent eachsentence as a constituent tree and use Tree Automata(TAs) and Tree Transducers (TTs) in the languageand translation models.Although this work is mainly language indepen-dent, proof-of-concept experiments will be executedon the English and Brazilian Portuguese (en-ptBR)language pair.
Previous research on factored trans-lation for this pair (using morphological informa-tion) showed that it improved the results in termsof BLEU (Papineni et al, 2001) and NIST (Dod-dington, 2002) scores, as shown in Table 1 (Caseliand Nunes, 2009).
However, even factored transla-tion models have limitations: many languages (andBrazilian Portuguese is not an exception) have rela-tively loose word order constraints and present long-distance agreements that cannot be efficiently repre-sented by those models.
Such phenomena motivatethe use of more powerful models that take syntacticinformation into account.2 Related workSyntax-based approaches for SMT have been pro-posed in many ways.
Some apply the TTS model:Yamada and Knight (2001) uses explicit inser-36en-ptBR ptBR-enBLEU NIST BLEU NISTPB-SMT 0,3589 7,8312 0,3903 8,3008FT 0,3713 7,9813 0,3932 8,4421Table 1: BLEU and NIST scores for PB-SMT and fac-tored translation experiments for the en-ptBR languagepairtion, reordering and translation rules, Nguyen et al(2008) uses synchronous CFGs rules and Liu et al(2006) uses TTs.
Galley et al (2006) also usestransducer rules but extract them from parse trees intarget language instead (the string-to-tree approach- STT).
Works that apply the TTT model includeGildea (2003) and Zhang et al (2008).
All thoseworks also include methods and algorithms for ef-ficient rule extraction since it?s unfeasible to extractall possible rules from a parsed corpus due to expo-nential cost.There have been research efforts to combinesyntax-based systems with phrase-based systems.These works mainly try to incorporate non-syntaticphrases into a syntax-based model: while Liu et al(2006) integrates bilingual phrase tables as separateTTS templates, Zhang et al (2008) uses an algo-rithm to convert leaves in a parse tree to phrases be-fore rule extraction.Language models that take into account syntac-tic aspects have also been an active research subject.While works like Post and Gildea (2009) and Van-deghinste (2009) focus solely on language modelingitself, Graham and van Genabith (2010) shows anexperiment that incorporates a syntax-based modelinto an PB-SMT system.3 Tree automata and tree transducersTree Automata are similar to Finite-state Automata(FSA), except they recognize trees instead of strings(or sequences of words).
Formally, FSA can onlyrepresent Regular Languages and thus, cannot ef-ficiently model several syntactic features, includ-ing long-distance agreement.
TA recognize the so-called Regular Tree Languages (RTLs), which canrepresent Context-free Languages (CFLs) since a setof all syntactic trees of a CFL is an RTL (Comonet al, 2007).
However, it is important to note thatthe reciprocal is not true: there are RTLs that cannotbe modeled by a CFL because those cannot capturethe inner structure of trees.
Figure 1 shows such anRTL, composed of two trees.
If we extract an CFGfrom this RTL it would have the recursive rule S?SS, which would generate an infinite set of syntac-tic trees.
In other words, there isn?t an CFG capableto generate only the syntactic trees contained in theRTL shown in Figure 1.
This feature implies thatRTLs have more representational power than CFLs.SSbSa ,SSaSbFigure 1: An RTL that cannot be modeled by a CFLAs a Finite-state Transducer (FST) is an extensionof an FSA that produces strings, a Tree Transducer isan extension of a TA that produces trees.
An FST iscomposed by an input RTL, an output RTL and a setof transformation rules.
Restrictions can be added tothe rules, leading to many TT variations, each withits properties (Graehl et al, 2008).
The variationsstudied in this work are the xT (extended top-down,for TTT models) and xTS (extended top-down tree-to-string, for TTS models).Top-down (T) transducers processes input treesstarting from its root and descending through itsnodes until it reaches the leaves, in contrast tobottom-up transducers, which do the opposite.
Fig-ure 2 shows a T rule, where uppercase letters (NP)represent symbols, lowercase letters (q, r, s) repre-sent states and x1 and x2 are variables (formal def-initions can be found in Comon et al (2007)).
De-fault top-down transducers must have only one sym-bol on the left-hand sides and thus cannot modelsome syntactic transformations (like local reorder-ing, for example) without relying on copy and deleteoperations (Maletti et al, 2009).
Extended top-down transducers allow multiple symbols on left-hand sides, making them more suited for syntaxmodeling.
This property is shown on Figure 3(adapted from Maletti et al (2009)).
Tree-to-stringtransducers simply drop the tree structure on right-37hand sides, which makes them adequate for transla-tion models wihtout syntactic information in one ofthe languages.
Figure 4 shows an example of a xTSrule, applied for the en-ptBR pair.qNPx2x1 ?
?NPqx1qx2Figure 2: Example of a T rule4 SMT ModelThe systems will be implemented using a discrim-inative, log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002), us-ing the language and translation models as featurefunctions.
Settings that uses more features besidesthose two models will also be built.
In particu-lar, I will investigate settings that incorporate non-syntactic phrases, using methods similar to Liu et al(2006) and Zhang et al (2008)The translation models will be weighted TTs(Graehl et al, 2008), which add probabilities to therules.
These probabilities will be learned by an EMalgorithm similar to the one described in Graehl etal.
(2008).
Rule extraction for TTS will be similarto the GHKM algorithm described in Galley et al(2004) but I also plan to investigate the approachesused by Liu et al (2006) and Nguyen et al (2008).For TTT rule extraction, I will use a method similarto the one described in Zhang et al (2008).I also plan to use language models which takesinto account syntactic properties.
Although mostworks in syntactic language models uses tree gram-mars like TSGs and TAGs, these can be simulated byTAs and TTs (Shieber, 2004; Maletti, 2010).
Thisproperty can help the systems implementation be-cause it?s possible to unite language and translationmodeling in one TT toolkit.5 MethodsIn this section, I present the experiments proposed inmy thesis and the materials required, along with themetrics used for evaluation.

As the focus of this thesis is the English andBrazilian Portuguese language pair, I will use thePesquisaFAPESP corpus2 in my experiments.
Thiscorpus is composed of 646 scientific papers, origi-nally written in Brazilian Portuguese and manuallytranslated into English, resulting in about 17,000parallel sentences.
As for syntactic annotation, I willuse the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) for2http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br38qSVPx2Vwasx1??

For the TTS systems (one for eachtranslation direction), the training set will be lexi-cally aligned using GIZA++ and for the TTT system,its syntactic trees will be aligned using techniquessimilar to the ones proposed by Gildea (2003) andby Zhang et al (2008).
Both TTS and TTT systemswill be implemented using Tiburon and Moses.
Forevaluation, BLEU and NIST scores on the test setwill be used.
The baseline will be the score for fac-tored translation, shown in Table 1.6 ContributionsAfter its conclusion, this thesis will have brought thefollowing contributions:3http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html4http://www.isi.edu/licensed-sw/tiburon5http://www.statmt.org/moses?
