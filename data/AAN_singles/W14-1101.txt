Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Health Text Mining and Information Analysis (Louhi) @ EACL 2014, page 1,Gothenburg, Sweden, April 26-30 2014.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsKeynote: Supporting evidence-based medicine using text miningSophia AnaniadouSchool of Computer Science, University of Manchester, UKsophia.ananiadou@manchester.ac.ukEvidence-based medicine uses systematic reviews to identify relevant studies to answer specific researchquestions.
An underlying principle of the approach is the importance of specifying a priori the researchquestion to drive the review process.
Such reviews have a central role in health technology assessments,development of clinical guidelines and public health guidance, and evidence-informed policy andpractice.
However, public health questions are complex and often need to be described using abstract,fuzzy terminology.
Understanding the scope of evidence often emerges during a review and cannot bedefined a priori.
Can text mining support a dynamic and multidimensional definition of relevance usinginteractive, exploratory searching under uncertainty?
Can text mining help reviewers to explore evidenceof interconnections between different factors, diseases and human behaviour?1
