On Generalized-Topic-Based Chinese Discourse Structure *Song Rou1 Jiang Yuru2,4 Wang Jingyi3Beijing Language and Culture University1Beijing University of Polytechnic Technology2Beijing Forest University3Beijing University of Information Science and technology4Abstract: Due to the lack of external formal marks, components in Chinese discourse can hardly becategorized into the traditional syntactic system.
In fact, Chinese is a typical topic-prominent language, soit should rather be analyzed from the point of topic.
This paper, targeting at computer processing, raises theconcepts of punctuation clause, generalized topic, discourse structure and topic clause, and reveals theproperties of Chinese discourse structure based on generalized topic.
The applicability of this theory hasbeen validated in an initial experiment.Keywords: Punctuation Clause, Generalized Topic, Discourse Structure, Topic Clause.1.
Punctuation Clause, Generalized Topic and Discourse StructureThe traditional study on syntax is based on individual sentences and the formal marks of syntacticcomponents.
But due to the lack of external formal marks, the concept of sentence in Chinese is not clearand the boundary of sentences is difficult to be defined.
What?s more, there are no formal means todiscriminate variant types of syntactic structures.
Therefore, the traditional parsing often meets difficultywhen it comes to Chinese.
This paper does not intend to provide a comprehensive analysis of theachievements and deficiency of the work done by the scholars in this field before.
The study is ratherbased on the factual language phenomena in Chinese and oriented to computer processing of the language.In this paper, some concepts, including punctuation clause, generalized topic, discourse structure and topicclause, are defined, and some properties of Chinese discourse structure are raised, and initial verificationdone in practical application.The basic unit of a Chinese discourse is punctuation clause (PClause).
A PClause is a string of wordsseparated by comma, semicolon, period, exclamation mark, question mark or quotation marks.
SincePClauses can be identified with formal marks, and their internal structure and their relations with eachother are restrained, therefore the basic conditions of processing them with computers are satisfied.E.g.
1.1.
(Adopted from newspaper news)????????????????????????????????????????????????????????(?Suddenly?
?he heard the sound of water in the washroom.
?the police officers and the specialpolicemen kicked the door open?
?wrestled the man in the washroom on the floor and handcuffed him?
?after identifying?
?was nobody but Ye Chengjian.1 )This is a discourse fragment composed of 6 punctuation clauses.E.g.
1.2.
(Adopted from newspaper news)?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
(?Ye Chengjian confessed murders in Zhuhai, seducing and blackmailing a Taiwan businessmannamed You, ?
and the four armed robbery in Macao??
and identified the places where he illegally hid* This study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, subject No.
608721211 With a purpose to show the structure of PClauses in Chinese, the translation of Chinese works may not appear verystandard in English.
The same applies hereinafter.the guns.
)This is a discourse fragment composed of 3 punctuation clauses.The discourse structure in Chinese is a kind of syntactic structure of a PClause sequence, which iscomposed of a generalized topic and a number of comments.
Generalized topic refers to a syntacticcomponent of a PClause.
The subsequent parts of the punctuation clause after it and the neighbor PClausesmay be comments about it.
Usually a generalized topic is nominal, functioning as the subject, object orattributive in the clause in traditional grammar.
In this case, the comments answer ?what?
and ?how?
aboutthe topic.
The generalized topic can also be verbal, playing the part of the central component of a verbphrase.
In some cases, the generalized topic can even be adverbial or an individual preposition.
That?s whythe word ?generalized?
is adopted.
For sake of simplicity, generalized topic will simply be referred to astopic in later sections.E.g.
1.3.
(Adopted from A Tale of Old Man Xing and His Dog, by Zhang Xianliang)???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
(She collected her needlework, went into the house, swept the kang2, got on it and sat down, loweredher head, let her hands dangle between her knees and waited quietly like a prisoner in the hearing room.
)In this example, each of the seven PClauses has the topic ??(she)?
as appears in the first PClause,and make comment about ??
(she)?, answering the questions about her behavior and what she is like.They compose a discourse structure.
The first PClause is composed of one topic and one comment, whilethe rest have comment only but no topic.
This discourse structure can be expressed below.{?[?????????
{She [collected her needlework,?????
went into the house,??????
swept the kang,????????
got on it and sat down,?????
lowered her head,?????????
let her hand dangle between her knees,????????????????]}
waited quietly like a prisoner in the hearing room.
]}For sake of visual cognition, the PClauses are put in different lines and are indented after the topicthat they comment.
This way of expression is called indented new-line representation.
What is quoted bythe ?
[]?marks is some comments, the left of which is the topic.
And what is quoted by the ?
{}?marks is thediscourse structure.E.g.
1.4.
(Adopted from Fortress Besieged by Chien Chung-Shu){?[{??[??????
{She [{was wearing only [ a scarlet top,????????]}]}
and navy blue, skin-tight shorts, ]}]}These two PClauses both comment on what ????
(she was wearing only)?.
???
(was wearingonly)?
is one topic, and ??????
(a scarlet top)?, and ????????
(navy blue, skin-tight shorts)?are two comments, answering the question of what was being worn only.
The topic and its two comments,when combined together, constitute a discourse structure, which is in turn the comment of ??
(she)?,answering the question of what she was like.
In other words, this discourse structure and ?she?
constitutean external discourse structure.E.g.
1.5.
(Adopted from Fortress Besieged by Chien Chung-Shu){??{??[????????????????
]}}2 a kind of bed in some parts of China{Hung-chien[{was so horrified that[his forehead nearly shrank into his eyebrows,(as) his eyebrows rose up to his hairline,]}]}These two PClauses both comment on the extent of his being horrified.
The verbal structure of verb +auxiliary??
?3?was so horrified?
?is the topic.
The topic and its two comments constitute a discoursestructure, which is in turn the comment of ???(Hung-chien)?.E.g.
1.6.
(Adopted from A Tale of Old Man Xing and His Dog, by Zhang Xianliang){???????[{?[??????
{More than 300 people of the team [{all [need feeding,??????]}]}
need clothing.
]}]}The two PClauses comment on what ????????
(more than 300 people all)?.
The generalizedtopic ??(all)?
has two comments ??????
(need feeding)?
and ??????
(need clothing)?.
Theyboth answer ?all?
what.
??(all)?
and the two comments constitutes a discourse structure, commenting onwhat ????????
(more than 300 people all)?
were like.
The two form external discourse structure.E.g.
1.7.
(Adopted from Preamble of CONSTITUTION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OFCHINA){???[{??????[???????????????????????????????]}??????????????????
]}{This Constitution, [{in legal form, [affirms the achievements of the struggles of the Chinese peopleof all nationalities,(and) defines the basic system and basic tasks of the state;]}(it) is the fundamental law of the state,(and) has supreme legal authority.
]}The adverbial ???????
(in legal form)?
in the first PClause is the generalized topic.
Thesection after it ???????????????
(affirms the achievements of the struggles of theChinese people of all nationalities)?
and the second PClause ????????????????
(defines the basic system and basic tasks of the state)?
are its two comments, answering what is done ?inlegal form?.
These three constitute a discourse structure.
This structure, together with the third and thefourth PClauses, are all comments on the subject of the first PClause ????
(this Constitution)?
,answering what ????
(this Constitution)?
is about.
These three comments, together with ????(thisConstitution)?
form the external discourse structure.E.g.
1.8.
(Adopted from Fortress Besieged by Chien Chung-Shu){??[{?[???????
{The students[{took[grades as too cheap,???????]}]}
courses as too easy]}]}The preposition ??4?
in the first PClause is the generalized topic.
???????
(took grades as toocheap)?and ????????
(took courses as too easy)?
comment on what and its result.
These threethen constitute a discourse structure, making comments on ???
(the students)?.
They form the externaldiscourse structure.E.g.
1.9.
(Adopted from Royal Tramp (Lu Ding Ji) by Louis Cha)????????{?????[?????????????????
]}Gu Yanwu bought at the town{a piece of court bulletin,3 the word ???
in Chinese is an auxiliary, indicating result.4 the word ???
in Chinese is a preposition.
It is used in transitive structure, introducing the object.
[(it) listed in detail the names of the criminals accused in the case of Ming Dynasty history.
]}The discourse structures in other examples of this section are embedding, while this example is ofoverlapping type.
The first PClause ?????????????
(Gu Yanwu bought at the town a pieceof court bulletin)?
is a discourse structure.
The object ?????
(a piece of court bulletin)?
is not thetopic in this PClause, but it is the topic of the second PClause ?????????????????
(itlisted in detail the names of the criminals accused in the case of Ming Dynasty history)?
and the two formanother discourse structure.
The two structures are overlapping, they share one component ?????
(acourt bulletin)?.2.
The static property of Chinese discourse structureFrom the examples in the previous section, we can notice the characteristics of Chinese discoursestructure:(1) A generalized topic and a comment group constitute a discourse structure.
A comment group iscomposed of a number of comments.
(2) A comment can be the part of a PClause that follows the topic, or a whole PClause, or anotherdiscourse structure.
Therefore, the discourse structure is embedded in a recursive way to theright.Using Context-Free Grammar, the rules are?
DiscourseStructure?GeneralizedTopic CommentGroup?
CommentGroup?Comment?
CommentGroup?Comment CommentGroup?
Comment?PClauseTail?
Comment?PClause?
Comment?DiscourseStructure?
GeneralizedTopic??
PClauseTail??
PClause?Here PClauseTail is the tail of the PClause where the generalized topic appears.
In these rules, ?-?are generating rules for discourse structure, comment group and comment respectively.
???
are thegenerating rules for generalized topic, PClause tail and PClauses.
The right part of these rules is related toterminal symbols and is not listed here.Statistics on the corpora show that in genuine Chinese texts, there are a large number of PClauseswhose subject is missing.
This phenomenon is regarded as zero anaphora or elision in traditional languagestudy.
But as a matter of fact, the nature of this phenomenon is that there is more than one comment thatcorresponds to a topic.
Since it is a topic, it is natural that there are a lot of comments.
There are pausesbetween the comments and the result is that several PClauses are formed.
Neither is this phenomenon zeroanaphora nor ellipses, but topic sharing.Take 1.8 as an example.
The following is its generating process (the numbers following the arrow arerule ID).DiscourseStructure?

?This nature describes the internal relations of a discourse structure.
Therefore it is termed staticnature.This nature can cover most examples in the preceding section except example 1.9.
This is because theoverlapping type of the discourse structure in the example 1.9 can not be represented by Context-FreeGrammar.3.
Dynamic Property of Chinese Topic Clause3.1.
Topic Structure and Topic ClauseIn this paper, the structure formed by a comment and its topic is called a topic structure.
A topicstructure as comment can be combined with an external topic and form an external topic structure.
If thetopic of a comment is the outmost layer of a discourse structure, it is then called the topic clause.
In mostcases, every PClause corresponds to a topic clause.E.g.3.1.
(Adopted from the Biology Section of China Encyclopedia)c1????????
?, (the spawning season of neoceratodus forsteri is quiet long)c2              ???
9?10 ?????
(usually September and October are mostproductive period)c3        ???
(eggs are big)c4        ??
6?7?
?, (eggs are 6-7 mm in diameter)c5          ???
?, (have gelatinous membrane)c6          ????
(are not sticky)c7        ????????
(the eggs are laid among plants)c8          ????????
(some sink deep in the water)Here, the outmost topic is ?????
(neoceratodus forsteri)?.The topic clause of c1 is c1 itself.
The comment is ??????
(the spawning season of is quietlong)?.c2????
9?10 ????
(usually September and October are most productive period)?is acomment, and its topic is????
(the spawning season)?.
The topic structure composed of the two is thecomment on ?????
(neoceratodus forsteri)?
?therefore ???????????
9?10????
?is the topic clause of c2?c3???
(eggs are big)?is the comment on the topic ?????

The topicclause of c3 is ????????.c4???
6?7 ??

The topic clause of c4 is ???????
6?7????c5?????
(have gelatinous membrane)?is the comment on the topic ??(eggs)?.
The topic structure??????
(eggs have gelatinous membrane)?
composed of the two is the comment on ?????
(neoceratodus forsteri)?.
And the topic clause of c5 is ????????????c6????
(are not sticky)?
is the comment on the topic ??(eggs)?.
The topic structure ?????
(eggs are not sticky)?
composed of the two is the comment on ?????
(neoceratodus forsteri)?.
And thetopic clause of c6 is ???????????c7????????
(the eggs are laid among plants)?
is the comment on the topic ?????
(neoceratodus forsteri)?.
The topic clause of c7 is ??????????????c8????????
(some sink deep in the water)?is the comment on the topic ??(eggs)??
Thetopic structure ?????????
(eggs some sink deep in the water)?
composed of the two is thecomment on the topic ?????
(neoceratodus forsteri)?.
And the topic clause of c8 is ??????????????
?The purpose of analyzing a PClause sequence is to find out its discourse structure.
If the topic clauseof every PClause is constructed, the topic of each comment at every layer is then found out, andconsequently the entire discourse structure will be clear.
The next section provides an approach to findingout the topic clause of PClauses.3.2.
Stack Model of Dynamic Generation of the Topic ClauseThe topic clause of PClause ci of Ex.3.1 is marked as ci?.
They are listed below.c1?.????????

right to the topicand replace it with c7?and we will have c7?.The topic of c8 is ??(eggs)?
in c7?.
Delete the part of c7?
right to the topic and replace it with c8?andwe will have c8?.Generally, given a PClause sequence },,{ 1 ncc ?
, if the first PClause is a complete structure oftopic-comment, then(1) the topic clause of the first PClause is the PClause itself;(2) if the topic of a subsequent PClause is missing, then the topic should be in the topic clause of itsprevious PClause;(3) the topic clause of every subsequent PClause can be generated recursively by stack operation.Note the topic clause of ic  as ic ?
?and the topic clause of 1+ic  as 1+ic ?,?3.1?if the topic of 1+ic  is missing?and ic ?= ?
?A ?where A is the topic of 1+ic , then1+ic ?= 1+iAc?
?
?3.2?if the topic of 1+ic  is not missing, then 1+ic ?= 1+ic .If we regard the beginning and the end of a topic clause as the bottom and the top of a stackrespectively, then the removal and connection of the components in the generation process of topic clauseare typical stack operations.
Therefore the recursive law of such generation can be called the stack modelThe stack model can not only applied to embedded discourse structure, but also some overlappingstructures such as instance 1.4.
Details are not given here.
Our investigation into corpora (about 340,000Chinese characters) of different registers shows that more than 95% PClauses meet the model.From the stack model, it can be seen that the key to generate the topic clause of a PClause is toidentifying which component of the topic clause of the previous PClause is its topic.
This would require touncover the constraints for forming the discourse structure.4.
Constraints on Discourse Structure4.1.
Acceptability and completeness of Topic ClauseA topic structure is composed of a topic and its comments.
Therefore mostly it is acceptable.
A topicclause is not only acceptable, but also complete with necessary syntactic and semantic components.
Takingadvantage of this nature, the filtering of topic-seeking for a PClause can be boiled down to the judgment ofthe acceptability and completeness of a single clause.
For example, the topic clause of PClause 7 inexample 3.1 is:c7?.????????????
(neoceratodus forsteri?s eggs are laid among plants)and PClause c8 is????????
(some sink deep in the water)According to the stack model, the options for the topic clause of c8 are:?1?
????????
(some sink deep in the water)?suppose that the topic of c8 is not missing??2?
????????????
(neoceratodus forsteri some sink deep in the water)?suppose that the topic of c8 is ?????
(neoceratodus forsteri)???3?
?????????????
(neoceratodus forsteri?eggs some sink deep in the water)?suppose that the topic of c8 is ??(eggs)???4?
???????????????
(neoceratodus forsteri?eggs some are laid sink deep inthe water)?suppose that the topic of c8 is ???
(be laid)???5?
?????????????????
(neoceratodus forsteri?eggs some are laid plantsink deep in the water)?suppose that the topic of c8 is ???(plant)???6?
???????????????????
(neoceratodus forsteri?eggs some are laidamong plant sink deep in the water)?suppose that the topic of c8 is ???(middle)?
?Chinese intuition tells us that (1) is not complete, and (4)(5)(6) are not acceptable, so the candidatesare (2) and (3) only.
We see that if we can formalize our intuition, we can considerably narrow down thescope of options.The topic and the comment of a topic clause are often from different PClauses, and the components ina topic clause that have discourse functions (such as discourse conjunctions) can affect the acceptability ofthe topic clause.
This problem needs to be addressed in separate study.4.2.
Semantic ConstraintsE.g.
4.1.??????????????
(He bought a wallet, (it) is a brand product.
)The topic of the second PClause could be ??(he)?
or ???
(a wallet)?.
We can eliminate the firstpossibility by using semantic constraints, because a person can not be a product.4.3.
Syntactic ConstraintsAn investigation into corpora shows that the syntactic relations of the topic and the comments are ofthe following types:(1) If the relation of a topic and its comment in the same PClause is subject-predicate, then the samerelation is true of it with its comments in other PClauses (see example 1.3);(2) If the relation of a topic and its comment in the same PClause is predicate-object,preposition-object or attribute-central, then the relation of it and its comment in other PClauses is of thesame type or subject-predicate type (see example 1.4 and 1.8).
(3) If the relation of a topic and its comment in the same PClause is adverbial-central orpredicate-complement, then its relation with its comment in other PClauses is the same (see example 1.5,1.6 and 1.7).
(4) If a component is not the topic of the PClause where it is appears, but is the topic of otherPClauses, then it must be the object or attribute in the PClause where it appears and its relation with thecomments in other PClauses is subject-predicate (see example 1.9).In addition, adjectives, numbers in partition in respect of quantity and some adverbs (such a adverbsindicating degree) cannot function as general topics.4.4 Context ConstraintsE.g.
4.2.??????????
(He has a friend, (who is)very generous with money.
)The topic of the second PClause could be ??(he)?
or ????
(a friend)?.
Whether it is ?he isgenerous with money?
or ?his friend is generous with money?, it will present no problem eithersemantically or syntactically.
However, abundant instances and analyses show that if(1) the structure of the topic clause of the previous PClause is SVO;(2) the core verb of the topic clause of the previous PClause has a sense of ?owing?
or ?introducing?
;and(3) the second PClause is an adjective phrase but does not fall into the category of mental statethen the topic of the second PClause is the object rather than the subject of the topic clause.According to this constraint, the topic of the second PClause is ????
(a friend)?4.5.
Cognition ConstraintsTheoretically, there is no limit to the size of a discourse structure.
Countless layers could beembedded or overlapped.
For example, we could have the following discourse structure.E.g.
4.3????????
3?????????
1????
4?????
1?????
5???
(The circumference ratio?sinteger part is 3,the first number in the fraction part is 1,followed by 4,followed by 1,followed by 5?
)Here ????
(circumference ratio)?, ?1?, ?4?, ?1?, ?5?
all are topics.
They could go on with no limit.But the study on factual corpora have discovered that the maximum layer of embedding oroverlapping is 5, and if we shall return from the deeper layers, the maximum number of the layers that canbe jumped back is 3.
This has much to do with people?s cognition ability.
The following is an example of 5layers of embedding and overlapping with 3 layers of maximum return.
The underlined words are thegeneralized topics.
The numbers in the brackets to the right of the PClauses indicating the depth of theembedding and overlapping.
PClause ?????
(release them)?
reaches the fifth layer in depth, but thenext PClause ???????
(when the authorities started investigating)?
returns to layer2, retreating 3layers.Ex.

Initial Application of Discourse Structure based on General Topic5.1.
Discourse Structure in EncyclopediaThe herein discussed Chinese discourse structure based on general topic has been initially applied andtested in the analyses of encyclopedia texts.The entries in encyclopedia are expository, covering people, places, species, events, devices andterms etc.
in various subjects.
Because the different aspects of an object must be exposed, the leading roleof the topic is very obvious.
It frequently occurs that many PClauses are used to comment on one topic,and the comments on different aspects of an object are often presented as embedded or overlappingstructures.
In order to mine the information of the object described, it is necessary to analyze the governingscope of a topic.
In other words, it is necessary to locate the object commented by every PClause.Therefore the discourse structure must be analyzed.
Take 3.1 for example, we must be clear about for?what?
September and October are the active period, the eggs of ?what?
are big, the eggs of ?what?
are6-7 mm in diameter, ?what?
has gelatinous membranes and so on.5.2.
An Experiment on Discourse Structure in EncyclopediaThe experiment object of the paper is the entries about various fishes in the biology volume of ChinaEncyclopedia.
The objective is the find the topic clause of every Pclause.There are 224 entries about fishes in this volume, each one with a title, viz.
the name of the order,family, genera and species of a fish.
The first PClause in the text does not mention the name, butintroduces the genera information of it.
The name is not necessarily mentioned in later Pclauses.
Forexample,???
?Neoceratodus forsteri; Queensland lungfish??????????????
1 ?(????????),??????????????
?125 ??,??
10 ????????????????????
(A member of the family Ceratodontidae and order Ceratodontiformes (see picture of Neoceratodusforsteri).
(It) is the biggest extant lungfish species in the world.
(Its)Body length (is) about 125 centimeters,(it) weighs as much as 10 kilograms.
(Its) Body is elongated, covered with big and thin round scales ?
)In the experiment, the entry names (both in Chinese and English) and bracketed information aredeleted.
But the entry title is added to the left of the first PClause, connected by a ??
(is) ?.
For example,the first PClause of the above example of neoceratodus forsteri is changed into ????????????????????
1??
?, the rest remains unchanged.The experiment selected 3999 PClauses of 86 entries as training data, and 577 PCauses of 13 entriesas open-test data.
The input of the experiment is the topic clause of a PClause and its next PClause, and theoutput is the topic clause of the second PClause.
In other words, the target of the experiment is to decidethe topic of the PClause within a limited scope under the scheme of stack model.For the training data, each PClause is replenished manually into a topic clause, and then the words aresegmented.
In this way, the training topic clause set G is obtained.
The principle of testing is describedbelow.
For each tested PClause c and the topic clause d of its proceeding PClause, word segmentation isdone separately.
String d is cut at different places, the tails are replaced with c every time.
Thus a numberof candidate topic clauses of c are obtained.
Then the similarity reckoning is made about the candidatetopic clauses and the topic clauses in G. The one with the maximum similarity is chosen as the result foroutput.In order to solve the problem of data sparse in the calculation, semantic generalization is made aboutrelated words.
The semantic categories employed are?subjects of fishes ( e.g.
neoceratodus forsteri,alopias), part (e.g.
head, scale, fin), position (e.g.
back, abdomen), location ( e.g.
front, upper), shape (e.g.fusiformis, cylindrical), size (e.g.
big, short), color (e.g.
red, light blue).
environment (e.g.
pond, near sea),geographical region(e.g.
the Pacific, Huanghai), season(e.g.
early spring, autumn), number (e.g.
3, 1-3) etc.Verbs are rarely generalized.The result of the initial experiment showed the accuracy rate for open test was 78%.
If add the title ofa text to the beginning of every PClause in the text, 66% accuracy rate can be got as a baseline.
The resultof the experiment is not high indeed and there is room for improvement.
Since the experiment principlewas the similarity of the topic clauses, in essence only the stack model and the acceptability of topic clauseare used.
Semantic constraints, syntactic constraints, context constraints and cognitive constraints are notemployed.
In addition, word segmentation is not entirely correct, and the semantic generalization is quiterough.
78% accuracy rate of under such rough conditions has initially proved the applicability of thetheoretical system.6.
DiscussionThis paper employs discourse structure of topic-comment in analyzing Chinese, takes PClauses as thebasic discourse unit, and extends the concept of topic to generalized topic.
As a result, the properties ofChinese discourse structure are proposed.
Investigations into large amount of language data have provedthat this theoretical system is natural and applicable to Chinese, which is also backed up by initialexperiment.
Of course, the theory need to be improved, and the various types of constraints under thetheory framework need to be further uncovered.
More and detailed study needs to be done along this path.References[1] CHEN Ping?1987?
