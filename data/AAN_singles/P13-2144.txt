The goal is to identifyhow the participants in a discussion splitinto subgroups with contrasting opinions.The members of each subgroup share thesame opinion with respect to the discus-sion topic and an opposing opinion tothe members of other subgroups.
Weuse opinion mining techniques to identifyopinion expressions and determine theirpolarities and their targets.
We opinionpredictions to represent the discussion inone of two formal representations: signedattitude network or a space of attitude vec-tors.
We identify opinion subgroups bypartitioning the signed network represen-tation or by clustering the vector spacerepresentation.
We evaluate the system us-ing a data set of labeled discussions andshow that it achieves good results.1 IntroductionArabic is one of the fastest growing languageson the internet.
The number of internet users inthe Arab region grew by 2500% over the past 10years.
As of January 2012, the number of Arabic-speaking internet users was 86 millions.
The re-cent political and civic movements in the ArabWorld resulted in a revolutionary growth in thenumber of Arabic users on social networking sites.For example, Arabic is the fastest growing lan-guage in Twitter history 1.This growth in the presence of Arab users onsocial networks and all the interactions and dis-cussions that happen among them led to a hugeamount of opinion-rich Arabic text being avail-able.
Analyzing this text could reveal the differentviewpoints of Arab users with respect to the topicsthat they discuss online.When a controversial topic is discussed, it isnormal for the discussants to adopt different view-points towards it.
This usually causes rifts in dis-cussion groups and leads to the split of the dis-cussants into subgroups with contrasting opinions.Our goal in this paper is to use natural languageprocessing techniques to detect opinion subgroupsin Arabic discussions.
Our approach starts byidentifying opinionated (subjective) text and deter-mining its polarity (positive, negative, or neutral).Next, we determine the target of each opinion ex-pression.
The target of opinion can be a namedentity mentioned in the discussion or an aspect ofthe discussed topic.
We use the identified opinion-target relations to represent the discussion in oneof two formal representations.
In the first repre-sentation, each discussant is represented by a vec-tor that encodes all his or her opinion informationtowards the discussion topic.
In the second repre-sentation, each discussant is represented by a nodein a signed graph.
A positive edge connects twodiscussants if they have similar opinion towardsthe topic, otherwise the sign of the edge is nega-1http://semiocast.com/publications/2011_11_24_Arabic_highest_growth_on_Twitter829tive.
To identify opinion subgroups, we cluster thevector space (the first representation) or partitionthe signed network (the second representation).We evaluate this system using a data set of Ara-bic discussions collected from an Arabic debatingsite.
We experiment with several variations of thesystem.
The results show that the clustering thevector space representation achieves better resultsthan partitioning the signed network representa-tion.2 Previous WorkOur work is related to a large body of research onopinion mining and sentiment analysis.
Pang &Lee (2008) and Liu & Zhang (2012) wrote two re-cent comprehensive surveys about sentiment anal-ysis and opinion mining techniques and applica-tions.Previous work has proposed methods for iden-tifying subjective text that expresses opinionand distinguishing it from objective text thatpresents factual information (Wiebe, 2000; Hatzi-vassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000a; Banea et al 2008;Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).Subjective text may express positive, negative,or neutral opinion.
Previous work addressed theproblem of identifying the polarity of subjectivetext (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000b; Hassanet al 2010; Riloff et al 2006).
Many of the pro-posed methods for text polarity identification de-pend on the availability of polarity lexicons (i.e.lists of positive and negative words).
Several ap-proaches have been devised for building such lex-icons (Turney and Littman, 2003; Kanayama andNasukawa, 2006; Takamura et al 2005; Hassanand Radev, 2010).
Other research efforts focusedon identifying the holders and the targets of opin-ion (Zhai et al 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2007;Bethard et al 2004).Opinion mining and sentiment analysis tech-niques have been used in various applications.One example of such applications is identifyingperspectives (Grefenstette et al 2004; Lin et al2006) which is most similar to the topic of thispaper.
For example, in (Lin et al 2006), the au-thors experiment with several supervised and sta-tistical models to capture how perspectives are ex-pressed at the document and the sentence levels.Laver et al(2003) proposed a method for extract-ing perspectives from political texts.
They usedtheir method to estimate the policy positions of po-litical parties in Britain and Ireland, on both eco-nomic and social policy dimensions.Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) present an un-supervised opinion analysis method for debate-side classification.
They mine the web to learnassociations that are indicative of opinion stancesin debates and combine this knowledge with dis-course information.
Anand et al(2011) present asupervised method for stance classification.
Theyuse a number of linguistic and structural fea-tures such as unigrams, bigrams, cue words, re-peated punctuation, and opinion dependencies tobuild a stance classification model.
In previouswork, we proposed a method that uses participant-to-participant and participant-to-topic attitudes toidentify subgroups in ideological discussions us-ing attitude vector space clustering (Abu-Jbara andRadev, 2012).
In this paper, we extend this methodby adding latent similarity features to the attitudevectors and applying it to Arabic discussions.
Inanother previous work, our group proposed a su-pervised method for extracting signed social net-works from text (Hassan et al 2012a).
Thesigned networks constructed using this methodwere based only on participant-to-participant at-titudes that are expressed explicitly in discussions.We used this method to extract signed networksfrom discussions and used a partitioning algo-rithm to detect opinion subgroups (Hassan et al2012b).
In this paper, we extend this method byusing participant-to-topic attitudes to construct thesigned network.Unfortunately, not much work has been doneon Arabic sentiment analysis and opinion min-ing.
Abbasi et al(2008) applies sentiment anal-ysis techniques to identify and classify document-level opinions in text crawled from English andArabic web forums.
Hassan et al(2011) pro-posed a method for identifying the polarity of non-English words using multilingual semantic graphs.They applied their method to Arabic and Hindi.Abdul-Mageed and Diab (2011) annotated a cor-pus of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) news textfor subjectivity at the sentence level.
In a laterwork (2012a), they expanded their corpus by la-830beling data from more genres using Amazon Me-chanical Turk.
Abdul-Mageed et al(2012a) de-veloped SAMAR, a system for subjectivity andSentiment Analysis for Arabic social media gen-res.
We use this system as a component in ourapproach.3 ApproachIn this section, we present our approach to de-tecting opinion subgroups in Arabic discussions.We propose a pipeline that consists of five com-ponents.
The input to the pipeline is a discussionthread in Arabic language crawled from a discus-sion forum.
The output is the list of participantsin the discussion and the subgroup membership ofeach discussant.
We describe the components ofthe pipeline in the following subsections.3.1 PreprocessingThe input to this component is a discussion threadin HTML format.
We parse the HTML file to iden-tify the posts, the discussants, and the thread struc-ture.
We transform the Arabic content of the postsand the discussant names that are written in Arabicto the Buckwalter encoding (Buckwalter, 2004).We use AMIRAN (Diab, 2009), a system for pro-cessing Arabic text, to tokenize the text and iden-tify noun phrases.3.2 Identifying Opinionated TextTo identify opinion-bearing text, we start from theword level.
We identify the polarized words thatappear in text by looking each word up in a lexiconof Arabic polarized words.
In our experiments, weuse Sifat (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012b), a lex-icon of 3982 Arabic adjectives labeled as positive,negative, or neutral.The polarity of a word may be dependant onits context (Wilson et al 2005).
For example,a positive word that appears in a negated contextshould be treated as expressing negative opinionrather than positive.
To identify the polarity ofa word given the sentence it appears in, we useSAMAR (Abdul-Mageed et al 2012b), a systemfor Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis for Ara-bic social media genres.
SAMAR labels a sen-tence that contains an opinion expression as pos-itive, negative, or neutral taking into account thecontext of the opinion expression.
The reportedaccuracy of SAMAR on different data sets rangesbetween 84% and 95% for subjectivity classifica-tion and 65% and 81% for polarity classification.3.3 Identifying Opinion TargetsIn this step, we determine the targets that the opin-ion is expressed towards.
We treat as an opin-ion target any noun phrase (NP) that appears ina sentence that SAMAR labeled as polarized (pos-itive or negative) in the previous step.
To avoidthe noise that may result from including all nounphrases, we limit what we consider as an opiniontarget, to the ones that appear in at least two postswritten by two different participants.
Since, thesentence may contain multiple possible targets forevery opinion expression, we associate each opin-ion expression with the target that is closest to it inthe sentence.
For each discussant, we keep trackof the targets mentioned in his/her posts and thenumber of times each target was mentioned in apositive/negative context.3.4 Latent Textual SimilarityIf two participants share the same opinion, theytend to focus on similar aspects of the discus-sion topic and emphasize similar points that sup-port their opinion.
To capture this, we followprevious work (Guo and Diab, 2012; Dasigi etal., 2012) and apply Latent Dirichelet Allocation(LDA) topic models to the text written by the dif-ferent participants.
We use an LDA model with100 topics.
So, we represent all the text writtenin the discussion by each participant as a vectorof 100 dimensions.
The vector of each participantcontains the topic distribution of the participant, asproduced by the LDA model.3.5 Subgroup DetectionAt this point, we have for every discussant the tar-gets towards which he/she expressed explicit opin-ion and a 100-dimensions vector representing theLDA distribution of the text written by him/her.We use this information to represent the discussionin two representations.
In the first representation,each discussant is represented by a vector.
For ev-ery target identified in steps 3 of the pipeline, weadd three entries in the vector.
The first entry holdsthe total number of times the target was mentionedby the discussant.
The second entry holds the831???

(a)(c) (b)Figure 1: An example debate taken from our dataset.
(a) is the discussion topic.
(b) and (c) are two postsexpressing contrasting viewpoints with respect to the topic.number of times the target was mentioned in a pos-itive context.
The third entry holds the number oftarget mentions in a negative context.
We also addto this vector the 100 topic entries from the LDAvector of that discussant.
So, if the number of tar-gets identified in step 3 of the pipeline is t thenthe number of entries in the discussant vector is3 ?
t+ 100.To identify opinion subgroups, we clusterthe vector space.
We experiment with severalclustering algorithms including K-means (Mac-Queen, 1967), Farthest First (FF) (Hochbaum andShmoys, 1985; Dasgupta, 2002), and ExpectationMaximization (EM) (Dempster et al 1977).The second representation is a signed networkrepresentation.
In this representation, each dis-cussant is represented by a node in a graph.
Twodiscussants are connected by an edge if they bothmention at least one common target in their posts.If a discussant mentions a target multiple times indifferent contexts with different polarities, the ma-jority polarity is assumed as the opinion of thisdiscussant with respect to this target.
A positivesign is assigned to the edge connecting two discus-sants if the number of targets that they have simi-lar opinion towards is greater than the targets thatthey have opposing opinion towards, otherwise anegative sign is assigned to the edge.To identify subgroups, we use a signed net-work partitioning algorithm to partition the net-work.
Each resulting partition constitutes a sub-group.
Following (Hassan et al 2012b), we usethe Dorian-Mrvar (1996) algorithm to partition thesigned network.
The optimization criterion aimsto have dense positive links within groups anddense negative links between groups.The optimization function is as follows:F (C) = ??
|NEG|+ (1?
?)?
|POS| (1)where C is the clustering under evaluation,|NEG| is the number of negative links betweennodes in the same subgroup, |POS| is the numberof positive links between nodes in different sub-groups, and ?
is a parameter that specifies impor-tance of the two terms.
We set ?
to 0.5 in all ourexperiments.Clusters are selected such that P (C) is mini-mum.
The best clustering that minimizes P (C) isfound by moving nodes around clusters in a greedyway starting with a random clustering.
To han-dle the possibility of finding a local minima, thewhole process is repeated k times with randomrestarts and the clustering with the minimum valueof P (C) is returned.
We set k to 3 in all our ex-periments.4 DataWe use data from an Arabic discussion forumcalled Naqeshny.2.
Naqeshny is a platform fortwo-sided debates.
The debate starts when a per-son asks a question (e.g.
which political party doyou support?)
and gives two possible answers orpositions.
The registered members of the web-site who are interested in the topic participate inthe debate by selecting a position and then post-ing text to support that position and dispute the2www.Naqeshny.com832opposing position.
This means that the data set isself-labeled for subgroup membership.
Since thetools used in our system are trained on ModernStandard Arabic (MSA) text, we selected debatesthat are mostly MSA.
The data set consists of 36debates comprising a total of 711 posts written by326 users.
The average number of posts per dis-cussion is 19.75 and the average number of partic-ipants per discussion is 13.08.
Figure 1 shows anexample from the data.5 Experiments and ResultsWe use three metrics to evaluate the resulting sub-groups: Purity (Manning et al 2008), Entropy,and F-measure.
We ran several variations of thesystem on the data set described in the previoussection.
In one variation, we use the signed net-work partitioning approach to detect subgroups.In the other variations, we use the vector spaceclustering approach.
We experiment with differ-ent clustering algorithms.
We also run two experi-ments to evaluate the contribution of both opinion-target counts and latent similarity features on theclustering accuracy.
In one run, we use target-opinion counts only.
In the other run, we use latentsimilarity features only.
EM was used as the clus-tering algorithm in these two runs.
Table 1 showsthe results.
All the results have been tested for sta-tistical significance using a 2-tailed paired t-test.The differences between the results of the differentmethods shown in the table are statistically signif-icant at the 0.05 level.
The results show that theclustering approach achieves better results than thesigned network partitioning approach.
This can beexplained by the fact that the vector representa-tion is a richer representation and encodes all thediscussants?
opinion information explicitly.
Theresults also show that Expectation Maximizationachieves significantly better results than the otherclustering algorithms that we experimented with.The results also show that both latent text similar-ity and opinion-target features are important andcontribute to the performance.6 ConclusionIn this paper, we presented a system for iden-tifying opinion subgroups in Arabic online dis-cussions.
