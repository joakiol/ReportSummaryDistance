In this paper, weaddress this problem by utilizing the labeleddata from two different languages.
As a pre-liminary study, we mainly focus on the sub-task of trigger type determination in eventextraction.
To make the training data in dif-ferent languages help each other, we pro-pose a uniform text representation with bi-lingual features to represent the samples andhandle the difficulty of locating the triggersin the translated text from both monolingualand bilingual perspectives.
Empirical studiesdemonstrate the effectiveness of the pro-posed approach to bilingual classification ontrigger type determination.
?1 IntroductionEvent extraction is an increasingly hot and chal-lenging research topic in the natural languageprocessing (NLP) community (Ahn, 2006; Saunet al 2006; Zhao et al 2008).
It aims to automat-ically extract certain types of events with the ar-guments to present the texts under a structuredform.
In event extraction, there are four primarysubtasks, named trigger identification, triggertype determination, argument identification, andargument role determination (Chen and NG,2012).
As an important technology in infor-mation extraction, event extraction could be ap-plied to many fields such as information retrieval,summarization, text mining, and question an-swering.Recently, the dominative approach to eventextraction is based on supervised learning wherea set of labeled samples are exploited to train amodel to extract the events.
However, the availa-?
*  Corresponding authorble labeled data are rather sparse due to variouskinds of event categories.
For example, the eventtaxonomy in ACE 2005 1  (Automatic ContentExtraction) includes 8 types of events, with 33subtypes, such as ?Marry/Life?
(subtype/type),and ?Transport/Movement?.
Moreover, somesubtypes such as ?Nominate/Personnel?
and?Convict/Justice?
contain less than 10 labeledsamples in the English and Chinese corpus re-spectively.
Apparently, such a small scale oftraining data is difficult to yield a satisfying per-formance.One possible way to alleviate the data sparse-ness problem in event extraction is to conductbilingual event extraction with training data fromtwo different languages.
This is motivated by thefact that labeled data from a language is highlypossible to convey similar information in anotherlanguage.
For example, E1 is an event samplefrom the English corpus and E2 is another one inthe Chinese corpus.
Apparently, E1 and the Eng-lish translation text of E2, share some importantclues such as meet and Iraq which highly indi-cates the event type of ?Meet/Contact?.E1: Bush arrived in Saint Petersburg on Sat-urday, when he also briefly met German chancel-lor Gerhard Schroeder, whose opposition to theIraq war had soured his relationship with Wash-ington, at a dinner hosted by Putin.E2: ?????????????????????
???????????????????(U.S.
president George W. Bush   willvisit Germany in February and meet withSchroeder, Iran and Iraq will be the focus of thetalks the two sides.
)In this paper, we address the data sparsenessproblem in event extraction with a bilingual pro-1http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/2005842cessing approach which aims to exploit bilingualtraining data to enhance the extraction perfor-mance in each language.
As a preliminary work,we mainly focus on the subtask of trigger typedetermination.
Accordingly, our goal is to designa classifier which is trained with labeled datafrom two different languages and is capable ofclassifying the test data from both languages.Generally, this task possesses two main chal-lenges.The first challenge is text representation,namely, how to eliminate the language gap be-tween the two languages.
To tackle this, we firstemploy Google Translate2, a state-of-the-art ma-chine translation system, to gain the translationof an event instance, similar to what has beenwidely done by previous studies in bilingualclassification tasks e.g., Wan (2008); Then, weuniformly represent each text with bilingualword features.
That is, we augment each originalfeature vector into a novel one which containsthe translated features.The second challenge is the translation forsome specific features.
It is well-known thatsome specific features, such as the triggers andtheir context features, are extremely importantfor determining the event types.
For example, inE3, both trigger ?left?
and named entity ?Sad-dam?
are important features to tell the event type,i.e., "Transport/Movement".
When it is translatedto Chinese, it is also required to know trigger ????
(left) and named entity ?????
(Saddam)in E4, the Chinese translation of E3.E3: Saddam's clan is said to have left for asmall village in the desert.E4: Chinese translation: ?
?
?
?
?
(Saddam) ??
??
??
(left) ??
?
?
???
??
?However, it is normally difficult to knowwhich words are the triggers and surroundingentities in the translated sentence.
To tackle thisissue, we propose to locate the trigger from bothmonolingual and bilingual perspectives in thetranslation text.
Empirical studies demonstratethat adding the translation of these specific fea-tures substantially improves the classificationperformance.The remainder of this paper is organized asfollows.
Section 2 overviews the related work onevent extraction.
Section 3 proposes our ap-2 www.google.comproach to bilingual event extraction.
Section 4gives the experimental studies.
In Section 5, weconclude our work and give some future work.2 Related WorkIn the NLP community, event extraction hasbeen mainly studied in both English and Chinese.In English, various supervised learning ap-proaches have been explored recently.
Bethardand Martin (2006) formulate the event identifica-tion as a classification problem in a word-chunking paradigm, introducing a variety of lin-guistically motivated features.
Ahn (2006) pro-poses a trigger-based method.
It first identifiesthe trigger in an event, and then uses a multi-classifier to implement trigger type determina-tion.
Ji and Grishman (2008) employ an ap-proach to propagate consistent event argumentsacross sentences and documents.
Liao andGrishman (2010) apply document level infor-mation to improve the performance of event ex-traction.
Hong et al (2011) leverage cross-entityinformation to improve traditional event extrac-tion, regarding entity type consistency as a keyfeature.
More recently, Li et al (2013) propose ajoint framework based on structured predictionwhich extracts triggers and arguments together.In Chinese, relevant studies in event extractionare in a relatively primary stage with focus onmore special characteristics and challenges.
Tanet al (2008) employ local feature selection andexplicit discrimination of positive and negativefeatures to ensure the performance of trigger typedetermination.
Chen and Ji (2009) apply lexical,syntactic and semantic features in trigger label-ing and argument labeling to improve the per-formance.
More recently, Li et al (2012) and Liet al (2013) introduce two inference mechanismsto infer unknown triggers and recover triggermentions respectively with morphological struc-tures.In comparison with above studies, we focus onbilingual event extraction.
Although bilingualclassification has been paid lots of attention inother fields (Wan 2008; Haghighi et al, 2008;Ismail et al, 2010; Lu et al, 2011?Li et al,2013), there is few related work in event extrac-tion.
The only one related work we find is Ji(2009) which proposes an inductive learning ap-proach to exploit cross-lingual predicate clustersto improve the event extraction task with themain goal to get the event taggers from extra re-sources, i.e., an English and Chinese parallelcorpus.
Differently, our goal is to make the la-843beled data from two languages help each otherwithout any other extra resources, which is origi-nal in the study of event extraction.3 The Proposed ApproachTrigger type determination aims to determine theevent type of a trigger given the trigger and itscontext (e.g., a sentence).
Existing approaches totrigger type determination mainly focus on mon-olingual classification.
Figure 1 illustrates theframework for Chinese and English.In comparison, our approach exploits the cor-pora from two different languages.
Figure 2 illus-trates the framework.
As shown in the figure, wefirst get the translated corpora of Chinese andEnglish origin corpora through machine transla-tion.
Then, we represent each text with bilingualfeatures, which enables us to merge the trainingdata from both languages so as to make themhelp each other.Figure 1: The framework of monolingual classifi-cation for trigger type determinationFigure 2: The framework of bilingual classificationfor trigger type determination3.1 Text RepresentationIn a supervised learning approach, labeled data istrained to obtain a classifier.
In this approach, theextracted features are the key components tomake a successful classifier.
Table 1 shows sometypical kinds of features in a monolingual classi-fication task for trigger type determination.
Tobetter understand these features, the real featureexamples in E3 are given in the table.Given the feature definition, a monolingualsample x  is represented as the combination of allthe features, i.e.,1 2, , , , _ , _ ,_ , , _ , _ne e e Tri POS Tri Tri conx POS con Ent Ent type Ent subtype?

Therefore, locatingthe trigger in the translated text becomes crucial.3.2 Locating Translated TriggerWithout loss of generality, we consider the caseof translating a Chinese event sample into anEnglish one.
Formally, the word sequence of aChinese event sample is denoted as1 2( , , , )c ns c c c?
, while the sequence of thetranslated one is denoted as1 2( , , )e ms e e e?
.Then, the objective is to get the English triggereTri  in es , given the Chinese trigger wordcTri in cs .
The objective function is given as fol-lows:?
?_1 ,argmax k l ek l m P e Tri?
?
?
(4)Where_k ledenotes the substring1( , , )k k le e e?ines  and 1 ,k l m?
?
.In this paper, the above function could besolved in two perspectives: monolingual and bi-lingual ones.
The former uses the English train-ing data alone to locate the trigger while the lat-ter exploit the bilingual information to get thetranslated counterpart of the Chinese trigger.The monolingual perspective: The objectiveis to locate the trigger with the monolingual in-formation.
That is,?
?_1 ,argmax | ,k l e e ek l m P e Tri s R?
?
?
(5)WhereeR  denotes the training resource in Eng-lish.
In fact, this task is exactly the first subtaskin event extraction named trigger identification,as mentioned in Introduction.
For a simplifiedimplementation, we first estimate the probabili-ties of ?
?_k l eP e Tri?
in eR  with maximum like-lihood estimation when_k l ee s?.The bilingual perspective: The objective is tolocate the trigger with the bilingual information.That is,?
?_1 ,argmax | , ,k l e e c ck l m P e Tri s s Tri?
?
?
(6)WherecTri  is the trigger word in Chinese and esis the translated text towardscs .
More generally,this can be solved from a standard word align-ment model in machine translation (Och et al1999; Koehn et al 2003).
However, training aword alignment requires a huge parallel corpuswhich is not available here.For a simplified implementation, we first getthecTri ?s translation?
denoted as cTritrans?with Google Translate.
Then, we estimate?
?_k l eP e Tri?
as follows:?
?
__ 0.9 ck l Trik l e if e transP e Tri others?????
?
???
(7)Where 0.9 is an empirical value which makes thetranslation probability become a dominative fac-tor when the translation of the trigger is found inthe translated sentence.
?
is a small value whichmakes the sum of all probabilities equals 1.The final decision is made according to boththe monolingual and bilingual perspectives, i.e.,?
??
?_1 ,_arg max  | ,| , ,k l e e ek l mk l e e c cP e Tri s RP e Tri s s Tri?

.4 Experimentation4.1 Experimental SettingData sets: The Chinese and English corpus foreven extraction are from ACE2005, which in-volves 8 types and 33 subtypes.
All our experi-ments are conducted on the subtype case.
Due tothe space limit, we only report the statistics foreach type, as shown in Table 2.
For each subtype,80% samples are used as training data while therest are as test data.# Chinese English totalLife 389 902 1291Movement 593 679 1272Transaction 147 379 526Business 144 137 281Conflict 514 1629 2143Contact 263 373 636Personnel 203 514 717Justice 457 672 1129total 2710 5285 7995Table 2: Statistics in each event type in both Chineseand English data setsFeatures: The features have been illustrated inTable 1 in Section 3.2.845Classification algorithm: The maximum en-tropy (ME) classifier is implemented with thepublic tool, Mallet Toolkits3 .Evaluation metric: The performance of eventtype recognition is evaluated with F-score.4.2 Experimental ResultsIn this section, we evaluate the performance ofour approach to bilingual classification on triggertype determination.
For comparison, followingapproaches are implemented:?
Monolingual: perform monolingual classi-fication on the Chinese and English corpusindividually, as shown in Figure 1.?
Bilingual: perform bilingual classificationwith partial bilingual features, ignoring thecontext features (e.g., context words, con-text entities) under the assumption that thetrigger location task is not done.?
Bilingual_location: perform bilingual clas-sification by translating each sample intoanother language and using a uniform repre-sentation with all bilingual features asshown in Section 3.2.
This is exactly ourapproach.
The number of the context wordsand entities before or after the trigger wordsis set as 3.0.6580.7060.6770.6790.6780.7340.620.640.660.680.70.720.74Chinese Test Data English Test DataF-scoreMonolingual Bilingual Bilingual_locationFigure 3: Performance comparison of the three ap-proaches on the Chinese and English test dataFigure 3 shows the classification results of thethree approaches on the Chinese and English testdata.
From this figure, we can see that Bilin-gual_location apparently outperform Monolin-gual, which verifies the effectiveness of usingbilingual corpus.
Specifically, the improvementby our approach in Chinese is impressive, reach-ing 7.6%.
The results also demonstrate the im-portance of the operation of the trigger location,3 http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/without which, bilingual classification can onlyslightly improve the performance, as shown inthe English test data.The results demonstrate that our bilingualclassification approaches are more effective forthe Chinese data.
This is understandable becausethe size of English data is much larger than thatof Chinese data, 5285 vs. 2710, as shown in Ta-ble 2.
Specifically, after checking the results ineach subtype, we find that some subtypes in Chi-nese have very few samples while correspondingsubtypes in English have a certain number sam-ples.
For example, the subtype of?Elect/Personnel?
only contains 30 samples inthe Chinese data while 161 samples can be foundin the English data, which leads a very high im-provement (15.4%) for the Chinese test data.
Insummary, our bilingual classification approachprovides an effective way to handle the datasparseness problem in even extraction.5 Conclusion and Future WorkThis paper addresses the data sparseness problemin event extraction by proposing a bilingual clas-sification approach.
In this approach, we use auniform text representation with bilingual fea-tures and merge the training samples from bothlanguages to enlarge the size of the labeled data.Furthermore, we handle the difficulty of locatingthe trigger from both the monolingual and bilin-gual perspectives.
Empirical studies show thatour approach is effective in using bilingual cor-pus to improve monolingual classification intrigger type determination.Bilingual event extraction is still in its earlystage and many related research issues need to beinvestigated in the future work.
For example, it isrequired to propose novel approaches to the bi-lingual processing tasks in other subtasks ofevent extraction.
Moreover, it is rather challeng-ing to consider a whole bilingual processingframework when all these subtasks are involvedtogether.AcknowledgmentsThis research work has been partially supportedby two NSFC grants, No.61375073, andNo.61273320, one National High-tech Researchand Development Program of ChinaNo.2012AA011102, one General Research Fund(GRF) project No.543810 and one Early CareerScheme (ECS) project No.559313 sponsored bythe Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, theNSF grant of Zhejiang Province No.Z1110551.846ReferencesAhn D. 2006.
