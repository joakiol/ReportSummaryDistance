GermaNet  - a Lex ica l -Semant ic  Net  for GermanBirgit Hamp and Helmut FeldwegSeminar fiir SprachwissenschaftUniversity of TiibingenGermanyemail: {hamp, fe ldweg}~sfs ,  nph i l ,  uni-tuebingen, deAbstractWe present he lexical-semantic net forGerman "GermaNet" which integratesconceptual ontological information withlexical semantics, within and across wordclasses.
It is compatible with the Prince-ton WordNet but integrates principle-based modifications on the construc-tional and organizational level as well ason the level of lexical and conceptual re-lations.
GermaNet includes a new treat-ment of regular polysemy, artificial con-cepts and of particle verbs.
It further-more encodes cross-classification and ba-sic syntactic information, constituting aninteresting tool in exploring the interac-tion of syntax and semantics.
The de-velopment of such a large scale resourceis particularly important as German upto now lacks basic online tools for the se-mantic exploration of very large corpora.1 I n t roduct ionGermaNet is a broad-coverage lexical-semanticnet for German which currently contains some16.000 words and alms at modeling at least thebase vocabulary of German.
It can be thoughtof as an online ontology in which meanings asso-ciated with words (so-called synsets) are groupedaccording to their semantic relatedness.
The basicframework of GermaNet is similar to the Prince-ton WordNet (Miller et al, 1993), guarantee-ing maximal compatibility.
Nevertheless someprinciple-based modifications have been applied.GermaNet is built from scratch, which means thatit is neither a translation of the English Word-Net nor is it based on a single dictionary or the-saurus.
The development of a German wordnethas the advantage that the applications devel-oped for English using WordNet as a resource canbe used for German with only minor modifica-tions.
This affects for example information extrac-tion, automatic sense disambiguation a d intelli-gent document retrieval.
Furthermore, GermaNetcan serve as a training source for statistical meth-ods in natural anguage processing (NLP) and itmakes future integration of German in multilin-gual resources such as EuroWordNet (Bloksma etal., 1996) possible.This paper gives an overview of the resourcesituation, followed by sections on the coverage ofthe net and the basic relations used for linkageof lexical and conceptual items.
The main partof the paper is concerned with the constructionprinciples of GermaNet and particular features ofeach of the word classes.2 Resources and ModelingMethodsIn English a variety of large-scale online linguisticresources are available.
The application of theseresources i essential for various NLP tasks in re-ducing time effort and error rate, as well as guar-anteeing a broader and more domain-independentcoverage.
The resources are typically put to usefor the creation of consistent and large lexicaldatabases for parsing and machine translation aswell as for the treatment of lexical, syntactic andsemantic ambiguity.
Furthermore, linguistic re-sources are becoming increasingly important astraining and evaluation material for statisticalmethods.In German, however, not many large-scalemonolingual resources are publically availablewhich can aid the building of a semantic net.
Theparticular esource situation for German makesit necessary to rely to a large extent on manuallabour for the creation process of a wordnet, basedon monolingual general and specialist dictionariesand literature, as well as comparisons with theEnglish WordNet.
However, we take a strongly9corpus-based approach by determining the basevocabulary modeled in GermaNet by lemmatizedfrequency lists from text corpora x.
This list is fur-ther tuned by using other available sources uch asthe CELEX German database.
Clustering meth-ods, which in principle can apply to large corporawithout requiring any further information i  orderto give similar words as output, proved to be inter-esting but not helpful for the construction of thecore net.
Selectional restrictions ofverbs for nounswill, however, be automatically extracted by clus-tering methods.
We use the Princeton Word-Net technology for the database format, databasecompilation, as well as the Princeton WordNet in-terface, applying extensions only where necessary.This results in maximal compatibility.3 Imp lementat ion3.1 CoverageGermaNet shares the basic database division intothe four word classes noun, adjective, verb, andadverb with WordNet, although adverbs are notimplemented in the current working phase.For each of the word classes the semantic spaceis divided into some 15 semantic fields.
The pur-pose of this division is mainly of an organizationalnature: it allows to split the work into packages.Naturally, the semantic fields are closely relatedto major nodes in the semantic network.
How-ever, they do not have to agree completely withthe net's top-level ontology, since a lexicographercan always include relations across these fields andthe division into fields is normally not shown tothe user by the interface software.GermaNet only implements lemmas.
We as-sume that inflected forms are mapped to baseforms by an external morphological analyzer(which might be integrated into an interface toGermaNet).
In general, proper names and ab-breviations are not integrated, even though thelexicographer may do so for important and fre-quent cases.
Frequency counts from text corporaserve as a guideline for the inclusion of lemmas.
Inthe current version of the database multi-word ex-pressions are only covered occasionaly for propernames (Olympische Spiele) and terminological ex-pressions (weifles Blutk6rperchen).
Derivates anda large number of high frequent German com-pounds are coded manually, making frequent use1We have access to a large tagged and lemma-tized online corpus of 60.000.000 words, compris-ing the ECI-corpus (1994) (Frankfurter Rundschau,Danau-Kumer, VDI Nachr~chten) and the T~b,ngerNewsKorpus, consisting of texts collected m Tfibingenfrom electronic newsgroups.of cross-classification.
An implementation f amore suitable rule-based classification of derivatesand the unlimited number of semantically trans-parent compounds fails due to the lack of algo-rithms for their sound semantic classification.
Theamount of polysemy is kept to a minimum in Ger-manet, an additional sense of a word is only intro-duced if it conflicts with the coordinates ofothersenses of the word in the network.
When in doubt,GermaNet refers to the degree of polysemy givenin standard monolingual print dictionaries.
Addi-tionally, GermaNet makes use of systematic cross-classification.3.2 RelationsTwo basic types of relations can be distinguished:lexlcal relations which hold between differentlexical realizations of concepts, and conceptualrelations which hold between different conceptsin all their particular realizations.Synonymy and antonymy are bidirectionallexical relations holding for all word classes.
Allother relations (except for the 'pertains to' rela-tion) are conceptual relations.
An example forsynonymy are torkeln and taumeln, which bothexpress the concept of the same particular lurch-ing motion.
An example for antonymy are theadjectives kalt (cold) and warm (warm).
Thesetwo relations are implemented and interpreted inGermaNet as in WordNet.The relation pertains to relates denominal d-jectives with their nominal base (finanzzell 'finan-cial' with Finanzen 'finances'), deverbal nominal-izations with their verbal base (Entdeckung 'dis-covery' with entdecken 'discover') and deadjecti-val nominalizations with their respective adjecti-val base (Mi~digkeit 'tiredness' with miide 'tired').This pointer is semantic and not morphologicalin nature because different morphological realiza-tions can be used to denote derivations from dif-ferent meanings of the same lemma (e.g.
konven-tionell is related to Konvention (Regeln des Urn-gangs) (social rule), while konventzonal is relatedto Konvention Ouristiseher Text) (agreement).The relation of hyponymy ('is-a') holds for allword classes and is implemented in GermaNet asin WordNet, so for example Rotkehlchen (robin)is a hyponym of Vogel (bird).Meronymy ('has-a'), the part-whole rela-tion, holds only for nouns and is subdividedinto three relations in WordNet (component-relation, member-relation, stuff-relation).
Get-maNet, however, currently assumes only one basicmeronymy relation.
An example for meronymy isArm (arm) standing in the meronymy relation toKSrper (body).10For verbs, WordNet makes the assumption thatthe relation of entai lment holds in two differ-ent situations.
(i) In cases of 'temporal inclusion'of two events as in schnarchen (snoring) entailingschlafen (sleeping).
(ii) In cases without tempo-ral inclusion as in what Fellbaum (1993, 19) calls'backward presupposition', holding between gelin-gen (succeed) and versuchen (try).
However, thesetwo cases are quite distinct from each other, justi-fying their separation i to two different relationsin GermaNet.
The relation of entailment is keptfor the case of backward presupposition.
Follow-ing a suggestion made in EuroWordNet (Alonge,1996, 43), we distinguish temporal inclusion byits characteristics that the first event is always asubevent of the second, and thus the relation iscalled subevent relation.The cause relation in WordNet is restricted tohold between verbs.
We extend its coverage toaccount for resultative verbs by connecting theverb to its adjectival resultative state.
For ex-ample 5When (to open) causes often (open).Selectional restrictions, giving informationabout typical nominal arguments for verbs andadjectives, are additionally implemented.
They donot exist in WordNet even though their existenceis claimed to be important to fully characterize averbs lexical behavior (Fellbaum, 1993, 28).
Theseselectional properties will be generated automat-ically by clustering methods once a sense-taggedcorpus with GermaNet classes is available.Another additional pointer is created to accountfor regular polysemy in an elegant and efficientway, marking potential regular polysemy at a veryhigh level and thus avoiding duplication of entriesand time-consuming work (c.f.
section 5.1).As opposed to WordNet, connectivity betweenword classes is a strong point of GermaNet.
Thisis achieved in different ways: The cross-class rela-tions ('pertains to') of WordNet are used more fre-quently.
Certain WordNet relations are modifiedto cross word classes (verbs are allowed to 'cause'adjectives) and new cross-class relations are in-troduced (e.g.
'selectional restrictions').
Cross-class relations are particularly important as theexpression of one concept is often not restrictedto a single word class.Additionally, the final version will contain ex-amples for each concept which are to be automat-ically extracted from the corpus.4 Gu id ing  Pr inc ip lesSome of the guiding principles of the GermaNetontology creation are different from WordNet andtherefore now explained.4.1 Artificial ConceptsWordNet does contain artificial concepts, that isnon-lexicaiized concepts.
However, they are nei-ther marked nor put to systematic use nor evenexactly defined.
In contrast, GermaNet enforcesthe systematic usage of artificial concepts and es-pecially marks them by a "?'.
Thus they can becut out on the interface level if the user wishesso.
We encode two different sorts of artificial con-cepts: (i) lexical gaps which are of a conceptualnature, meaning that they can be expected to beexpressed in other languages ( ee figure 2) and (ii)proper artificial concepts (see figure 3).
2 Advan-tages of artificial concepts are the avoidance ofun-motivated co-hyponyms and a systematic struc-turing of the data.
See the following examples:In figure 1 noble man is a co-hyponym to theother three hyponyms of human, even though thefirst three are related to a certain education andnoble man refers to a state a person is in from birthon.
This intuition is modeled in figure 2 with theadditional artificial concept feducated human.Imaslor c ~Figure 1: Without Artifical ConceptsFigure 2: Lexical GapsIn figure 3, all concepts except for the leavesare proper artificial concepts.
That is, one wouldnot expect any language to explicitly verbalize theconcept of for example manner of motion verbswhich specify the specific instrument used.
Nev-ertheless such a structuring is important because~Note that these are not notationally distinguishedup to now; this still needs to be added.llit captures emantic intuitions every speaker ofGerman has and it groups verbs according to theirsemantic relatedness.4.2 Cross-Classi f icat ionContrary to WordNet, GermaNet enforces the useof cross-classification whenever two conflicting hi-erarchies apply.
This becomes important for ex-ample in the classification of animals, where folkand specialized biological hierarchy compete ona large scale.
By cross-classifying between thesetwo hierarchies the taxonomy becomes more ac-cessible and integrates different semantic ompo-nents which are essential to the meaning of theconcepts.
For example, in figure 4 the concept ofa cat is shown to biologically be a vertebrate, anda pet in the folk hierarchy, whereas awhale is onlya vertebrate and not a pet.Figure 4: Cross-ClassificationThe concept of cross-classification is of greatimportance in the verbal domain as well, wheremost concepts have several meaning componentsaccording to which they could be classified.
How-ever, relevant information would be lost if onlyone particular aspect was chosen with respect ohyponymy.
Verbs of sound for example form adistinct semantic lass (Levin et al, in press), themembers of which differ with respect to additionalverb classes with which they cross-classify, in En-glish as in German.
According to Levin (in press,7), some can be used as verbs of motion accompa-nied by sound ( A train rumbled across the loop-line bridge.
), others as verbs of introducing directspeech (Annabel squeaked, "Why can't you staywith us?")
or verbs expressing the causation ofthe emission of a sound (He crackled the news-paper, folding it carelessly).
Systematic ross-classification allows to capture this fine-graineddistinction easily and in a principle-based way.5 Ind iv idua l  Word  C lasses5.1 NounsWith respect o nouns the treatment of regularpolysemy in GermaNet deserves pecial atten-tion.A number of proposals have been made for therepresentation f regular polysemy in the lexicon.It is generally agreed that a pure sense numera-tion approach isnot sufficient.
Instead, the differ-ent senses of a regularly polysemous word need tobe treated in a more principle-based manner (seefor example Pustejovsky (1996)).GermaNet is facing the problem that lexical en-tries are integrated in an ontology with strict in-heritance rules.
This implies that any notion ofregular polysemy must obey the rules of inheri-tance.
It furthermore prohibits joint polysemousentries with dependencies from applying for onlyone aspect of a polysemous entry.A familiar type of regular polysemy is the "or-ganization - building it occupies" polysemy.
Ger-maNet lists synonyms along with each concept.Therefore it is not possible to merge such a typeof polysemy into one concept and use cross-classification to point to both, institution andbuil&ng as in figure 5.
This is only possible ifall synonyms of both senses and all their depen-dent nodes in the hierarchy share the same regularpolysemy, which is hardly ever the case.lartlfact I IorganizativnlI 1 If, ilityl lin,titutio.
IFigure 5: Regular PolysemyCross-ClassificationasTo allow for regular polysemy, GermaNet in-troduces a special bidirectional relator which isplaced to the top concepts for which the regularpolysemy holds (c.f.
figure 6).In figure 6 the entry bank1 (a financial institu-tzon that accepts depossts and channels the moneyinto lending activities) may have the synonymsdepository financial institution, banking concern,12i~manner of motion I[ '~iter'atlve I I?spoed I lTin..trumentl I'~sound I'general.

In addition, bankl may have hy-ponyms uch as credit union, agent bank, commer-cial bank, full service bank, which do not share theregular polysemy of bank1 and banks.Statistically frequent cases of regular polysemyare manually and explicitly encoded in the net.This is necessary because they often really aretwo separate concepts (as in pork, pig) and eachsense may have different synonyms (pork meat isonly synonym to pork).
However, the polysemypointer additionally allows the recognition of sta-tistically infrequent uses of a word sense createdby regular polysemy.
So for example the sentenceI had crocodile for lunch is very infrequent in thatcrocodile is no t commonly perceived as meat butonly as animal.
Nevertheless we know that a reg-ular polysemy exists between meat and animal.Therefore we can reconstruct via the regular pol-ysemy pointer that the meat sense is referred toin this particular sentence ven though it is notexplicitly encoded.
Thus the pointer can be con-ceived of as an implementation f a simple defaultvia which the net can account for language pro-ductivity and regularity in an effective manner.5.2 AdjectivesAdjectives in GermaNet are modeled in a tax-onomical manner making heavy use of the hy-ponymy relation, which is very different from thesatellite approach taken in WordNet.
Our ap-proach avoids the rather fuzzy concept of indi-rect antonyms introduced by WordNet.
Addition-ally we do not introduce artificial antonyms asWordNet does (pregnant, unpregnant).
The taxo-13nomical classes follow (Hundsnurscher and Splett,1982) with an additional class for pertainyms 3.5.3 VerbsSyntactic frames and particle verbs deserve spe-cial attention in the verbal domain.
The framesused in GermaNet differ from those in WordNet,and particle verbs as such are treated in WordNetat all.Each verb sense is linked to one or more syntac-tic frames which are encoded on a lexical ratherthan on a conceptual level.
The frames usedin GermaNet are based on the complementationcodes provided by CELEX (Burnage, 1995).
Thenotation in GermaNet differs from the CELEXdatabase in providing a notation for the subjectand a complementation code for Obligatory reflex-ive phrases.
GermaNet provides frames for verbsenses, rather than for lemmas, implying a fulldisambiguation of the CELEX complementationcodes for GermaNet.Syntactic information i  GermaNet differs fromthat given in WordNet in several ways.
It marksexpletive subjects and reflexives explicitly, en-codes case information, which is especially impor-tant in German, distinguishes between differentrealizations of prepositional nd adverbial phrasesand marks to-infinitival as well as pure infinitivalcomplements explicitly.Particles pose a particular problem in German.They are very productive, which would lead to anexplosion of entries if each particle verb was ex-plicitly encoded.
Some particles establish a regu-lar semantic pattern which can not be accountedfor by a simple enumeration approach, whereasothers are very irregular and ambiguous.
Wetherefore propose a mixed approach, treating ir-regular particle verbs by enumeration and regularparticle verbs in a compositional manner.
Com-position can be thought of as a default which canbe overwritten by explicit entries in the database.We assume a morphological component such asGERTWOL (1996) to apply before the composi-tional process tarts.
Composition itself is imple-mented as follows, relying on a separate lexiconfor particles.
The particle lexicon is hierarchicallystructured and lists selectional restrictions withrespect to the base verb selected.
An example forthe hierarchical structure isgiven in figure 7 (with-out selectional restrictions for matters of simplic-ity), where heraus- is a hyponym of her- and aus-.SAdjectives pertaining to a noun from which theyderive their meaning (financial, finances).Selectional restrictions for particles include Ak-tionsart, a particular semantic verb field, deicticorientation and directional orientation ofthe baseverb.The evaluation of a particle verb takes the fol-lowing steps.
First, GermaNet is searched for anexplicit entry of the particle verb.
If no such entryexists the verb is morphologically analyzed and itssemantics i compositionally determined.
For ex-ample the particle verb herauslau\]en i figure7 isa hyponym to lau\]en (walk) as well as to heraus-.Criteria for a compositional treatment are sep-arability, productivity and a regular semanticsof the particle (see Fleischer and Barz (1992),Stiebels (1994), Stegmann (1996)).6 ConclusionA wordnet for German has been described which,compared with the Princeton WordNet, integratesprinciple-based modifications and extensions onthe constructional and organizational level as wellas on the level of lexical and conceptual relations.Innovative features of GermaNet are a new treat-ment of regular polysemy and of particle verbs,as well as a principle-based encoding of cross-classification and artificial concepts.
As com-patibility with the Princeton WordNet and Eu-roWordNet is a major construction criteria of Ger-maNet, German can now, finally, be integratedinto multilingual large-scale projects based on on-tological and conceptual information.
This con-stitutes an important step towards the design oftruly multilingual tools applicable in key areassuch as information retrieval and intelligent In-ternet search engines.Re ferencesA.
