This model can be interpreted as a graphstructure that offers flexible querying func-tionality beyond current XML-based querylanguages and powerful methods for consis-tency control.
We illustrate our approach byapplying it to the syntactically and semanti-cally annotated SALSA/TIGER corpus.1 IntroductionOver the years, much effort has gone into the creationof large corpora with multiple layers of linguistic an-notation, such as morphology, syntax, semantics, anddiscourse structure.
Such corpora offer the possibilityto empirically investigate the interactions betweendifferent levels of linguistic analysis.Currently, the most common use of such corporais the acquisition of statistical models that make useof the ?more shallow?
levels to predict the ?deeper?levels of annotation (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Milt-sakaki et al, 2005).
While these models fill an im-portant need for practical applications, they fall shortof the general task of lexicon modelling, i.e., creat-ing an abstracted and compact representation of thecorpus information that lends itself to ?linguisticallyinformed?
usages such as human interpretation orintegration with other knowledge sources (e.g., deepgrammar resources or ontologies).
In practice, thistask faces three major problems:?At the time of writing, Sebastian Pad?
and Dennis Spohrwere affiliated with Saarland University, and Anette Frank withDFKI Saarbr?cken and Saarland University.Ensuring consistency.
Annotation reliability andconsistency are key prerequisites for the extraction ofgeneralised linguistic knowledge.
However, with theincreasing complexity of annotations for ?deeper?
(inparticular, semantic) linguistic analysis, it becomesmore difficult to ensure that all annotation instancesare consistent with the annotation scheme.Querying multiple layers of linguistic annotation.A recent survey (Lai and Bird, 2004) found that cur-rently available XML-based corpus query tools sup-port queries operating on multiple linguistic levelsonly in very restricted ways.
Particularly problematicare intersecting hierarchies, i.e., tree-shaped analyseson multiple linguistic levels.Abstractions and application interfaces.
A per-vasive problem in annotation is granularity: The gran-ularity offered by a given annotation layer may di-verge considerably from the granularity that is neededfor the integration of corpus-derived data in largesymbolic processing architectures or general lexicalresources.
This problem is multiplied when morethan one layer of annotation is considered, for exam-ple in the characterisation of interface phenomena.While it may be possible to obtain coarser-grainedrepresentations procedurally by collapsing categories,such procedures are not flexibly configurable.Figure 1 illustrates these difficulties with a sentencefrom the SALSA/TIGER corpus (Burchardt et al,2006), a manually annotated German newspaper cor-pus which contains role-semantic analyses in theFrameNet paradigm (Fillmore et al, 2003) on topof syntactic structure (Brants et al, 2002).1 The se-1While FrameNet was originally developed for English, themajority of frames has been found to generalise well to other389which the official Croatia but in significant international-law difficulties bring wouldFigure 1: Multi-layer annotation of a German phrase with syntax and frame semantics (?which would bringofficial Croatia into significant difficulties with international law?
)mantic structure consists of frames, semantic classesassigned to predicating expressions, and the semanticroles introduced by these classes.
The verb bringen(?to bring?)
is used metaphorically and is thus analy-sed as introducing one frame for the ?literal?
reading(PLACING) and one for the ?understood?
reading(CAUSATION), both with their own role sets.The high complexity of the semantic structure evenon its own shows the necessity of a device for con-sistency checking.
In conjunction with syntax, itpresents exactly the case of intersecting hierarchieswhich is difficult to query.
With respect to the issue ofabstraction, note that semantic roles are realised vari-ously as individual words (was (?which?)
) and con-stituents (NPs, PPs), a well-known problem in deriv-ing syntax-semantics mappings from corpora (Frank,2004; Babko-Malaya et al, 2006).Our proposal.
We propose that the problems in-troduced above can be addressed by formalising cor-pora in an integrated, multi-layered corpus and lexi-con model in a declarative logical framework, morespecifically, the description logics-based OWL DLformalism.
The major benefits of this approach arethat all relevant properties of the annotation and theunderlying model are captured in a uniform represen-tation and, moreover, that the formal semantics of themodel makes it possible to use general and efficientknowledge representation techniques for consistencycontrol.
Finally, we can extract specific subsets froma corpus by defining task-specific views on the graph.After a short discussion of related approaches inlanguages (Burchardt et al, 2006; Boas, 2005).Section 2, Section 3 provides details on our method-ology.
Sections 4 and 5 demonstrate the benefits ofour strategy on a model of the SALSA/TIGER data.Section 6 concludes.2 Related WorkOne recent approach to lexical resource modellingis the Lexical Systems framework (Polgu?re, 2006),which aims at providing a highly general represen-tation for arbitrary kinds of lexica.
While this isdesirable from a representational point of view, theresulting models are arguably too generic to supportstrong consistency checks on the encoded data.A further proposal is the currently evolving Lex-ical Markup Framework (LMF; Francopoulo etal.
(2006)), an ISO standard for lexical resource mod-elling, and an LMF version of FrameNet exists.
How-ever, we believe that our usage of a typed formalismtakes advantage of a strong logical foundation andthe notions of inheritance and entailment (cf.
Schef-fczyk et al (2006)) and is a crucial step beyond therepresentational means provided by LMF.Finally, the closest neighbour to our proposal isthe ATLAS project (Laprun et al, 2002), whichcombines annotations with a descriptive meta-model.However, to our knowledge, ATLAS only modelsbasic consistency constraints, and does not capturedependencies between different layers of annotation.3903 Modelling Multilevel Corpora in OWL DL3.1 A formal graph-based LexiconThis section demonstrates how OWL DL, a stronglytyped representation language, can serve to transpar-ently formalise corpora with multi-level annotation.OWL DL is a logical language that combines theexpressivity of OWL2 with the favourable computa-tional properties of Description Logics (DL), notablydecidability and monotonicity (Baader et al, 2003).The strongly typed, well-defined model-theoretic se-mantics distinguishes OWL DL from recent alterna-tive approaches to lexicon modelling.Due to the fact that OWL DL has been definedin the Resource Description Framework (RDF3), thefirst central benefit of using OWL DL is the possibil-ity to conceive of the lexicon as a graph ?
a net-likeentity with a high degree of interaction between lay-ers of linguistic description, with an associated classhierarchy.
Although OWL DL itself does not have agraph model but a model-theoretic semantics basedon First Order Logic, we will illustrate our ideas withreference to a graph-like representation, since this iswhat we obtain by transforming our OWL DL filesinto an RDFS database.Each node in the graph instantiates one or moreclasses that determine the properties of the node.
Ina straightforward sense, properties correspond to la-belled edges between nodes.
They are, however, alsorepresented as nodes in the graph which instantiate(meta-)classes themselves.The model is kept compact by OWL?s support formultiple instantiation, i.e., the ability of instancesto realise more than one class.
For example, in asyntactically and semantically annotated corpus, allsyntactic units (constituents, words, or even partsof words) can instantiate ?
in addition to a syntac-tic class ?
one or more semantic classes.
Multipleinstantiation enables the representation of informa-tion about several annotation layers within singleinstances.As we have argued in Section 2, we believe thathaving one generic model that can represent all cor-pora is problematic.
Instead, we propose to constructlexicon models for specific types of corpora.
The2http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL/3http://www.w3.org/RDF/design of such models faces two central design ques-tions: (a) Which properties of the annotated instancesshould be represented?
; (b) How are different typesof these annotation properties modelled in the graph?Implicit features in annotations.
Linguistic anno-tation guidelines often concentrate on specifying thelinguistic data categories to be annotated.
However,a lot of linguistically relevant information often re-mains implicit in the annotation scheme.
Examplesfrom the SALSA corpus include, e.g., the fact thatthe annotation in Figure 1 is metaphorical.
This in-formation has to be inferred from the configurationthat one predicate evokes two frames.
As such infor-mation about different annotation types is useful infinal lexicon resources, e.g.
to define clean generali-sations over the data (singling out ?special cases?
), toextract information about special data categories, andto define formally grounded consistency constraints,we include it in the lexicon model.Form of representation.
All relevant informationhas to be represented either as assertional statementsin the model graph (i.e., nodes connected by edges),or as definitional axioms in the class hierarchy.4This decision involves a fundamental trade-off be-tween expressivity and flexibility.
Modelling featuresas axioms in the class hierarchy imposes definitionalconstraints on all instances of these classes and isarguably more attractive from a cognitive perspec-tive.
However, modelling features as entities in thegraph leads to a smaller class hierarchy, increasedquerying flexibility, and more robustness in the faceof variation and noise in the data.3.2 Modelling SALSA/TIGER DataWe now illustrate these decisions concretely by de-signing a model for a corpus with syntactic andframe-semantic annotation, more concretely theSALSA/TIGER corpus.
However, the general pointswe make are valid beyond this particular setting.As concerns implicit annotation features, we havedesigned a hierarchy of annotation types which nowexplicitly expresses different classes of annotationphenomena and which allows for the definition ofannotation class-specific properties.
For example,frame targets are marked as a multi-word target if4This choice corresponds to the DL distinction between TBox(?intensional knowledge?)
and ABox (?extensional knowledge?).391Linguisticmodel?

)their span contains at least two terminal nodes.
Thehierarchy is shown on the right of Figure 2, whichshows parts of the bipartite class hierarchy.The left-hand side of Figure 2 illustrates the lin-guistic model, in which frames and roles are organ-ised according to FrameNet?s inheritance relation.Although this design seems to be straightforward, itis the result of careful considerations concerning thesecond design decision.
Since FrameNet is a hierar-chically structured resource with built-in inheritancerelations, one important question is whether to modelindividual frames, such as SELF_MOTION or LEAD-ERSHIP, and their relations either as instances of ageneral class Frame and as links between these in-stances, or as hierarchically structured classes withricher axiomatisation.
In line with our focus on con-sistency checking, we adopt the latter option, whichallows us to use built-in reasoning mechanisms ofOWL DL to ensure consistency.Annotation instances from the corpus instantiatemultiple classes in both hierarchies (cf.
Figure 2): Onthe annotation side according to their types of phe-nomena; on the linguistic side based on their frames,roles, syntactic functions, and categories.Flexible abstraction.
Section 1 introduced granu-larity as a pervasive problem in the use of multi-levelcorpora.
Figure 2 indicates that the class hierarchyof the OWL DL model offers a very elegant wayof defining generalised data categories that provideabstractions over model classes, both for linguisticcategories and annotation types.
Moreover, proper-ties can be added to each abstracting class and thenbe used, e.g., for consistency checking.
In our case,Figure 2 shows (functional) edge labels and part-of-speech tags provided by TIGER, as well as sets of(largely theory-neutral) grammatical functions andcategories that subsume these fine-grained categoriesand support the extraction of generalised valence in-formation from the lexicon.An annotated corpus sentence.
To substantiatethe above discussion, Figure 3 shows a partial lexiconrepresentation of the example in Figure 1.
The boxesrepresent instance nodes, with classes listed abovethe horizontal line, and datatype properties belowit.5 The links between these instances indicate OWLobject properties which have been defined for theinstantiated classes.
For example, the metaphoricalPLACING frame is shown as a grey box in the middle.Multiple inheritance is indicated by instancescarrying more than one class, such as the in-stance in the left centre, which instantiates theclasses SyntacticUnit, NP, OA, NounP andobj.
Multi-class instances inherit the propertiesof each of these classes, so that e.g., the meta-phoric frame annotation of the PLACING framein the middle has both the properties defined forframes (hasCoreRole) and for frame annotations(hasTarget).
The generalised syntactic categoriesdiscussed above are given in italics (e.g., NounP).The figure highlights the model?s graph-basedstructure with a high degree of interrelation betweenthe lexicon entities.
For example, the grey PLAC-ING frame instance is directly related to its roles(left, bottom), its lexical anchor (right), the surround-ing sentence (top), and a flag (top left) indicatingmetaphorical use.5For the sake of simplicity, we excluded explicit ?is-a?

For OWL DL models, such a mecha-nism is available in the form of the Sesame (Broekstraet al, 2002) SeRQL query language.
Since SeRQLmakes it possible to extract and view arbitrary sub-graphs of the model, querying of intersective hierar-chies is possible in an intuitive manner.An interesting application for this querying mecha-nism is to extract genuine lexicon views on the corpusannotations, e.g., to extract syntax-semantics map-ping information for particular senses of lemmas, bycorrelating role assignments with deep syntactic in-formation.
These can serve both for inspection andfor interfacing the annotation data with deep gram-matical resources or general lexica.
Applied to ourcomplete corpus, this ?lexicon?
contains on average8.5 role sets per lemma, and 5.6 role sets per frame.The result of such a query is illustrated in Table 1 forthe lemma senken (?to lower?
).From such view, frame- or lemma-specific rolesets, i.e., patterns of role-category-function assign-ments can easily be retrieved.
A typical example isgiven in Table 2, with additional frequency counts.The first row indicates that the AGENT role has beenrealised as a (deep) subject noun phrase and the ITEMas (deep) object noun phrase.We found that generalisations over corpus cate-gories encoded in the class hierarchies are centralRole Cat Func FreqItem NounP obj 26Agent NounP subj 15Difference PrepP mod-um 6Cause NounP subj 4Value_2 PrepP mod-auf 3Value_2 PrepP pobj-auf 2Value_1 PrepP mod-von 1Table 1: Role-category-function assignments forsenken / CAUSE_CHANGE_OF_SCALAR_POSITION (CCSP)Role set for senken / CCSP FreqAgent Item 11subj objNounP NounPCause Item 4subj objNounP NounPItem 4objNounPAgent Item Difference 2subj obj mod-umNounP NounP PrepPTable 2: Sample of role sets for senken / CCSPto the usefulness of the resulting patterns.
For ex-ample, the number of unique mappings between se-mantic roles and syntactic categories in our corpusis 5,065 for specific corpus categories, and 2,289 forabstracted categories.
Thus, the definition of an ab-straction layer, in conjunction with a flexible querymechanism, allows us to induce lexical characterisa-tions of the syntax-semantics mapping ?
aggregated393and generalised from disparate corpus annotations.Incremental refinements.
Querying, and the re-sulting lexical views, can serve yet another purpose:Such aggregates make it possible to conduct a data-driven search for linguistic generalisations whichmight not be obvious from a theoretical perspective,and allow quick inspection of the data for counterex-amples to plausible regularities.In the case of semantic roles, for example, sucha regularity would be that semantic roles are notassigned to conflicting grammatical functions (e.g.,deep subject and object) within a given lemma.
How-ever, some of the role sets we extracted containedexactly such configurations.
Further inspection re-vealed that these irregularities resulted from eithernoise introduced by errors in the automatic assign-ment of grammatical functions, or instances withsyntactically non-local role assignments.Starting from such observations, our approach sup-ported a semi-automatic, incremental refinement ofthe linguistic and annotation models, in this case in-troducing a distinction between local and non-localrole realisations.Size of the lexicon.
Using a series of SeRQLqueries, we have computed the size of the cor-pus/lexicon model for the SALSA/TIGER data (seeTable 3).
The lexicon model architecture as describedin Section 3 results in a total of more than 304,000instances in the lexicon, instantiating 581 differentframe classes and 1,494 role classes.5 Consistency ControlThe first problem pointed out in Section 1 was theneed for efficient consistency control mechanisms.Our OWL DL-based model in fact offers two mech-anisms for consistency checking: axiom-based andquery-based checking.Axiom-based checking.
Once some constraint hasbeen determined to be universally applicable, it canbe formulated in Description Logics in the form ofaxiomatic expressions on the respective class in themodel.
Although the general interpretation of theseaxioms in DL is that they allow for inference of newstatements, they can still be used as a kind of well-formedness ?constraint?.
For example, if an individ-ual is asserted as an instance of a particular class, theType No.

Forsemantic role annotations, axioms can e.g.
define theadmissible relations between a particular frame andits roles.
This is illustrated in the DL statements be-low, which express that an instance of PLACING mayat most have the roles GOAL, PATH, etc.Placing v ?.hasRole (Placing.Goal unionsq Placing.Path unionsq .
.
.
)Placing v ?.hasRole (Placing.Goal unionsq Placing.Path unionsq .
.
.
)Relations between roles can be formalised in asimilar way.
An example is the excludes relation inFrameNet, which prohibits the co-occurrence of roleslike CAUSE and AGENT of the PLACING frame.
Thiscan be expressed by the following statement.Placing v ?
((?.hasRole Placing.Cause)u(?.hasRole Placing.Agent))The restrictions are used in checking the consistencyof the semantic annotation; violations of these con-straints lead to inconsistencies that can be identifiedby theorem provers.
Although current state-of-the-artreasoners do not yet scale to the size of entire cor-pora, axiom-based checking still works well for ourdata due to SALSA?s policy of dividing the originalTIGER corpus into separate subcorpora, each deal-ing with one particular lemma (cf.
Scheffczyk et al(2006)).394Query-based checking.
Due to the nature of ourgraph representation, constraints can combine dif-ferent types of information to control adherence toannotation guidelines.
Examples are the assignmentof the SUPPORTED role of support verb constructions,which ought to be assigned to the maximal syntacticconstituent projected by the supported noun, or theexclusion of reflexive pronouns from the span of thetarget verb.
However, the consistency of multi-levelannotation is often difficult to check: Not only aresome types of classification (e.g.
assignment of se-mantic classes) inherently difficult; the annotationsalso need to be considered in context.
For such cases,axiom-based checking is too strict.
In practice, it isimportant that manual effort can be reduced by auto-matically extracting subsets of ?suspicious?
data forinspection.
This can be done using SeRQL querieswhich ?
in contrast to the general remarks on thescalability of reasoners ?
are processed and evaluatedvery quickly on the entire annotated corpus data.Example queries that we formulated examine sus-picious configurations of annotation types, such astarget words evoking two or more frame annota-tions which are neither marked as underspecified nortagged as a pair of (non-)literal metaphorical frameannotations.
Here, we identified 8 cases of omittedannotation markup, namely 4 missing metaphor flagsand 4 omitted underspecification links.On the semantic level, we extracted annotationinstances (in context) for metaphorical vs. non-metaphorical readings, or frames that are involvedin underspecification in certain sentences, but not inothers.
While the result sets thus obtained still re-quire manual inspection, they clearly illustrate howthe detection of inconsistencies can be enhanced bya declarative formalisation of the annotation scheme.Another strategy could be to concentrate on framesor lemmas exhibiting proportionally high variationin annotation (Dickinson and Meurers, 2003).6 ConclusionIn this paper, we have constructed a DescriptionLogics-based lexicon model directly from multi-layerlinguistic corpus annotations.
We have shown howsuch a model allows for explicit data modelling, andfor flexible and fine-grained definition of various de-grees of abstractions over corpus annotations.Furthermore, we have demonstrated that a pow-erful logical formalisation which integrates an un-derlying annotation scheme can be used to directlycontrol consistency of the annotations using generalKR techniques.
It can also overcome limitationsof current XML-based search tools by supportingqueries which are able to connect multiple levels oflinguistic analysis.
These queries can be used vari-ously as an additional means of consistency control,to derive quantitative tendencies from the data, toextract lexicon views tailored to specific purposes,and finally as a general tool for linguistic research.AcknowledgementsThis work has been partly funded by the GermanResearch Foundation DFG (grant PI 154/9-2).
