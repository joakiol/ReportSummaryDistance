1972074 T?bingen, Germany{eh,kuebler,knaumann}@sfs.uni-tuebingen.deAbstractThis paper reports on the SYN-RA(SYNtax-based Reference Annotation)project, an on-going project of annotatingGerman newspaper texts with referentialrelations.
The project has developed an in-ventory of anaphoric and coreference rela-tions for German in the context of a uni-fied, XML-based annotation scheme forcombining morphological, syntactic, se-mantic, and anaphoric information.
Thepaper discusses how this unified annota-tion scheme relates to other formats cur-rently discussed in the literature, in par-ticular the annotation graph model of Birdand Liberman (2001) and the pie-in-the-sky scheme for semantic annotation.1 IntroductionThe purpose of this paper is threefold: (i) it dis-cusses an annotation scheme for referential relationsfor German that is significantly broader in scopethan existing schemes for the same task and lan-guage and that also goes beyond the inventory ofanaphoric relations included in the pie-in-the-skysample feature structures1 , (ii) it presents a unified,XML-based annotation scheme for combining mor-phological, syntactic, semantic, and anaphoric infor-mation, and (iii) it discusses how this unified anno-tation scheme relates to other formats currently dis-cussed in the literature, in particular the annotation1See e.g.
nlp.cs.nyu.edu/meyers/pie-in-the-sky/analysis5.graph model of Bird and Liberman (2001) and thepie-in-the-sky scheme for semantic annotation2 .2 Referential RelationsThis section introduces the inventory of referentialrelations adopted in the SYN-RA project.
We definereferential relations as a cover-term for all contex-tually dependent reference relations.
The inventoryof such relations adopted for SYN-RA is inspired bythe annotation scheme first developed in the MATEproject (Davies et al, 1998).
However, it takes acautious approach in that it only adopts those refer-ential relations from MATE for which the develop-ers of MATE report a sufficiently high level of inter-annotator agreement (Poesio et al, 1999).SYN-RA currently uses the following subsetof relations: coreferential, anaphoric, cataphoric,bound, split antecedent, instance, and expletive.
Thepotential markables are definite NPs, personal pro-nouns, relative, reflexive, and reciprocal pronouns,demonstrative, indefinite and possessive pronouns.There is a second research effort under way at theEuropean Media Laboratory Heidelberg, which alsoannotates German text corpora and dialog data withreferential relations.
Since their corpora are not pub-licly available, it is difficult to verify their inventoryof referential relations.
Kouchnir (2003) has usedtheir data and describes the relations anaphoric,coreferential, bridging, and none.Following van Deemter and Kibble (2000), wedefine a coreference relation to hold between two2See nlp.cs.nyu.edu/meyers/pie-in-the-sky/pie-in-the-sky-descript.html.13NPs just in case they refer to the same extra-linguistic referent in the real world.
In the followingexample, a coreference relation exists between thenoun phrases [1] and [2], and an anaphoric relationbetween the noun phrase [2] and the personal pro-noun [3].
Since noun phrases [1] and [2] are corefer-ential, all three NPs belong to the same coreferencechain.
In keeping with the MUC-6 annotation stan-dard3, we establish the anaphoric relations of a pro-noun only to its most recently mentioned antecedent.

?Apart from expletive uses of es and anaphoricuses with an NP antecedent, the pronoun es can alsobe used in cases of event anaphora as in sentence(9).

Currently, the annotation in SYN-RA is restricted to NP anaphora and therefore eventanaphors such as in sentence (9) remain unannotatedfor anaphora.

?The annotation of such relations is performedmanually with the annotation tool MMAX (M?llerand Strube, 2003).
Its graphical user interface al-lows for easy selection of the relevant markables andthe accompanying relation between the contextuallydependent expression and its antecedent.3 Automatic Extraction of Markables andof Semantic InformationAnnotation of referential relations involves twomain tasks: the identification of markables, i.e.,identifying the class of expressions that can enterinto referential relations, and the identification of theparticular referential relations that two or more ex-pressions enter into.
Identification of markables re-quires at least partial syntactic annotation of the text.If referential relations need to be annotated fromplain text, then markables must be identified semi-automatically from the output of a chunker or fullparser, if available, or otherwise completely man-ually.
However, in each of these two scenarios,identification of markables is a time-consuming pro-cess.
In case of semi-automatic annotation, the ef-fort required depends on the quality of the parser, butwill require at least some amount of manual post-correction of the parser output.Identification of markables is considerably easierfor treebank data since treebanks already provide thenecessary syntactic information.
For German, thereare currently two large-scale treebanks available: theNEGRA/TIGER (Brants et al, 2002) treebank andthe T?bingen treebanks for spoken and written Ger-man (Stegmann et al, 2000; Telljohann et al, 2003).All the treebanks were annotated with the help of theannotation tool Annotate (Plaehn, 1998).
The tree-bank annotations are available in the Annotate ex-port format (Brants, 1997) and in an XML format.The SYN-RA project is based on the T?bingentreebank of written German (T?Ba-D/Z).
This tree-bank uses as its data source a collection of articles ofthe German daily newspaper taz (die tageszeitung).The treebank currently comprises appr.
15 000 sen-tences, with a new release of 7 000 additional sen-tences scheduled for June of this year.Due to its fine grained syntactic annotation, theT?Ba-D/Z treebank data are ideally suited as a basisfor the identification of markables and for extract-ing relevant syntactic and semantic properties foreach markable.
The T?Ba-D/Z annotation schemedistinguishes four levels of syntactic constituency:the lexical level, the phrasal level, the level of topo-logical fields, and the clausal level.
The primaryordering principle of a clause is the inventory oftopological fields, which characterize the word or-15IhrePPOSATasfSchulkameradinNNasfCassieNEasfBernallNEasffragtenVVFIN3pitsiePPERnp*3,$,??obKOUS??siePPERnsf3anAPPRaGottNEasmglaubeVVFIN3sks.$.???

e.g.
(Drach, 1937;H?hle, 1986)).
The T?Ba-D/Z annotation relieson a context-free backbone (i.e.
proper trees with-out crossing branches) of phrase structure combinedwith edge labels that specify the grammatical func-tion of the phrase in question.Figure 1 shows an example tree from the T?Ba-D/Z treebank for sentence (10).
The sentence is di-vided into two clauses (SIMPX), and each clause issubdivided into topological fields.
The main clauseis made up of the following fields: VF (mnemonicfor: Vorfeld ?
?initial field?)
contains the sentence-initial, topicalized constituent.
LK (for: linke Satz-klammer ?
?left sentence bracket?)
is occupied by thefinite verb.
MF (for: Mittelfeld ?
?middle field?)
con-tains adjuncts and complements of the main verb.NF (for: Nachfeld ?
?final field?)
contains extra-posed material ?
in this case an indirect yes/no ques-tion.
The subordinate clause is again divided intothree topological fields: C (for: Komplementierer ??complementizer?
), MF, and VC (for: Verbalkomp-lex ?
verbal complex).
Edge labels are renderedin boxes and indicate grammatical functions.
Thesentence-initial NX (for: noun phrase) is marked asOA (for: accusative complement), the pronouns siein the main and subordinate clause as ON (for: nom-inative complement).
(10) IhreTheirSchulkameradinfellow studentCassieCassieBernallBernallfragtenaskedsiethey[subj],,obwhethersieshe[subj]aninGottGodglaube.believes.
?They asked their fellow student Cassie Bernallwhether she believes in God.
?Topological field information and grammaticalfunction information is crucial for anaphora resolu-tion since binding-theory constraints crucially relyon sentence-structure (if the binding theory princi-ples are stated configurationally (Chomsky, 1981))or on argument-obliqueness (if the binding theoryprinciples are stated in terms of argument structure,as in (Pollard and Sag, 1994)).
In the case at hand,the subject pronoun of the main clause, sie, can-not be anaphorically related to the object NP IhreSchulkameradin Cassie Bernall since they are co-arguments of the same verb.
However, the posses-sive pronoun ihre and the subject pronoun sie of thesubordinate clause, can be and, in fact, are anaphor-ically related, since they are not co-arguments of thesame verb.
This can be directly inferred from thetreebank annotation, specifically from the sentencestructure and the grammatical function information16encoded on the edge labels.
Most published compu-tational algorithms of anaphora resolution, including(Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Ingria andStallard, 1989), rely on such binding-constraint fil-ters to minimize the set of potential antecedents forpronouns and reflexives.As already pointed out, the sample sentence con-tains four markables: one possessive pronoun Ihre,two occurrences of the pronoun sie and one complexNP Ihre Schulkameradin Cassie Bernall.
The latterNP is a good example of SYN-RA?s longest-matchprinciple for identifying markables.
In case of com-plex NPs, the entire NP counts as a markable, butso do its subconstituents ?
in the case at hand, par-ticularly the possessive pronoun ihre.
All of this in-formation can be directly derived from the treebankaccount.
Compared to other annotation efforts forGerman where markables have to be chosen manu-ally (M?ller and Strube, 2003), manual annotationin the SYN-RA project can, thus, be restricted to theselection of the appropriate referential relations be-tween referentially dependent expressions and theirnominal antecedents.4 The Unified, XML-based AnnotationSchemeThe annotation of referential expressions is em-bedded in a unified format which also containsmorphological, syntactic, and semantic information.The annotation scheme is represented in XML, thewidely acknowledged standard for exchanging data,which guarantees portability and re-usability of thedata.
Each sentence, as well as all words andall nodes in the syntactic structure, are assigned aunique ID.
These IDs are used in the annotation ofreferential relations.
The annotation of the treebanksentence 11976 (cf.
example (10)) is shown in Fig-ure 2.The sentence number is encoded as the ID of thesentence.
The first word, Ihre, has an anaphoric rela-tion to a noun phrase in the previous sentence.
Thisrelation is marked in the element anaphora, whichgives the antecedent as node 517 of sentence 11975,i.e.
the previous sentence.
The other two anaphoricrelations are sentence-internal, the first personal pro-noun sie having Ihre (id: s11976w0) as antecedent,the second one the noun phrase Ihre SchulfreundinCassie Bernall (id: s11976n513).
The annotation ofthe first personal pronoun is an example for the an-notation of an anaphoric chain.
Ihre and sie belongto the same chain.
However, in order to facilitate theextraction of direct relations, such chains are repre-sented in a way that each anaphoric expression refersto the last occurrence of an antecedent.The SYN-RA scheme is very similar to theMUC-6 coreference annotation scheme4 but it ismore powerful in two respects: As described above,the inventory is not restricted to coreference andanaphoric relations, it also covers e.g.
instance rela-tions or split antecedent relations.
The latter relationis also the reason for encoding the relational infor-mation as XML elements, and not as attributes ofa word or a node.
If an anaphor enters into a splitantecedent relation, it has more than one distinct an-tecedent.
In this case, the element anaphora has two(or more) relations.
Such an example is graphicallydisplayed for sentence (4) in Figure 3.
The rele-vant XML representation of the complex entry forthe word beide is shown in Figure 4.5 Related WorkThis section discusses how the unified SYN-RA an-notation scheme relates to other formats currentlydiscussed in the literature, in particular the pie-in-the-sky scheme for semantic annotation5 and theannotation graph model of (Bird and Liberman,2001).
While these two annotation schemes are byno means the only contenders for corpus annotationstandards in the literature, they are certainly amongthe most ambitious and promising.While the pie-in-the-sky scheme is clearly stillunder development, the following characteristicsand goals can already be gleaned from its web-page and the annotation examples presented there:The annotation is feature-structure-based and incor-porates various levels of linguistic annotation, inparticular a PROPBANK style predicate-argumentstructure, dependency style syntactic information,as well as morpho-syntactic and word class infor-mation.

Ac-cordingly, semantic representations provide the or-ganizing principle while morpho-syntactic and syn-tactic information play a subordinated role.The SYN-RA annotation scheme resembles thepie-in-the-sky scheme in that it also uses one levelof representation, in this case hierarchical syntac-tic structure, as the organizing principle and treatsreferential relations, grammatical function informa-tion, and morpho-syntactic annotation as subordi-nated types of information.
More generally, the pie-in-the-sky and the SYN-RA representations offer aparticular view of the annotation, each with its own?perspective?
: semantics-based (pie-in-the-sky) andsyntax-based (SYN-RA).By contrast, Bird and Liberman?s (2001) anno-tation graphs are intended as a graph-based, multi-layered annotation scheme where each level of lin-guistic annotation is treated equally, as an indepen-dent layer.
The graph-based annotation model ispowerful enough to also allow groupings of discon-tinuous constituents and other non-adjacent linguis-tic phenomena, without having to rearrange the lin-ear order of the input.
In both respects, their annota-tion model is maximally general.6 Future DirectionsIn the previous section we have compared twoperspective-dependent annotation schemes that usea particular level of linguistic annotation as their pri-mary organizing principle and have contrasted themwith the perspective-independent annotation-graphmodel.
We believe that both types of represen-tation models have their independent justification.Perspective-based representations, such as SYN-RA and pie-in-the-sky, are well-justified for partic-ular application scenarios.
For example, for textsummarization and other semantic tasks, the pie-in-the-sky model seems particularly well-motivatedsince the pertinent semantic information can be eas-ily extracted from its predicate-argument-structure-rooted feature structures.
For other tasks, such asanaphora resolution, for which syntactic informa-tion is more relevant, the syntax-based representa-tion of SYN-RA allows for an easier extraction ofthe relevant information for rule-based, statistical,19and machine-learning approaches to computationalanaphora resolution.
More generally, perspective-based representations are highly task-dependent.
Itwould be misguided to consider them as ideal, task-independent annotation standards.
If one wantsto establish a task-independent annotation standard,then a perspective-independent annotation schemesuch as the annotation graph model looks like apromising direction for future research.
In particu-lar, such research should focus on techniques that al-low for easy conversion of perspective-independentrepresentations to task-dependent views of the rele-vant linguistic information.ReferencesSteven Bird and Mark Liberman.
