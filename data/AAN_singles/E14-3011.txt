Proceedings of the Student Research Workshop at the 14th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 96?105,Gothenburg, Sweden, April 26-30 2014.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsComplexity of Word Collocation Networks:A Preliminary Structural AnalysisShibamouli LahiriComputer Science and EngineeringUniversity of North TexasDenton, TX 76207, USAshibamoulilahiri@my.unt.eduAbstractIn this paper, we explore complex net-work properties of word collocation net-works (Ferret, 2002) from four differentgenres.
Each document of a particulargenre was converted into a network ofwords with word collocations as edges.We analyzed graphically and statisticallyhow the global properties of these net-works varied across different genres, andamong different network types within thesame genre.
Our results indicate that thedistributions of network properties are vi-sually similar but statistically apart acrossdifferent genres, and interesting variationsemerge when we consider different net-work types within a single genre.
We fur-ther investigate how the global propertieschange as we add more and more collo-cation edges to the graph of one partic-ular genre, and observe that except forthe number of vertices and the size ofthe largest connected component, networkproperties change in phases, via jumps anddrops.1 IntroductionWord collocation networks (Ferret, 2002; Ke,2007), also known as collocation graphs (Heyer etal., 2001; Choudhury and Mukherjee, 2009), arenetworks of words found in a document or a doc-ument collection, where each node corresponds toa unique word type, and edges correspond to wordcollocations (Ke and Yao, 2008).
In the simplestcase, each edge corresponds to a unique bigram inthe original document.
For example, if the wordswAand wBappeared together in a document asa bigram wAwB, then the word collocation net-work of that particular document will contain anedge wA?
wB.
Note that edges can be directed(wA?
wB) or undirected (wA?
wB).
Further-more, they can be weighted (with the frequency ofthe bigram wAwB) or unweighted.It is interesting to note that word collocationnetworks display complex network structure, in-cluding power-law degree distribution and small-world behavior (Matsuo et al., 2001a; Matsuo etal., 2001b; Masucci and Rodgers, 2006; Liang etal., 2012).
This is not surprising, given that nat-ural language generally shows complex networkproperties at different levels (Ferrer i Cancho andSol?e, 2001; Motter et al., 2003; Biemann et al.,2009; Liang et al., 2009).
Moreover, researchershave used such complex networks in applicationsranging from text genre identification (Stevanaket al., 2010) and Web query analysis (Saha Royet al., 2011) to semantic analysis (Biemann et al.,2012) and opinion mining (Amancio et al., 2011).In Section 2, we will discuss some of these appli-cations in more detail.The goal of this paper is to explore somekey structural properties of these complex net-works (cf.
Table 1), and study how they varyacross different genres of text, and also acrossdifferent network types within the same genre.We chose global network properties like di-ameter, global clustering coefficient, shrinkageexponent (Leskovec et al., 2007), and small-worldliness (Walsh, 1999; Matsuo et al., 2001a),and experimented with four different text collec-tions ?
blogs, news articles, academic papers, anddigitized books (Section 4.1).
Six different typesof word collocation networks were constructed oneach document, as well as on the entire collections?
two with directed edges, and four with undi-rected edges (Section 3).
We did not take into ac-count edge weights in our study, and kept it as apart of our future work (Section 5).Tracking the variation of complex networkproperties on word collocation networks yieldedseveral important observations and insights.
We96noted in particular that different genres had con-siderable visual overlap in the distributions ofglobal network properties like diameter and clus-tering coefficient (cf.
Figure 2), although sta-tistical significance tests indicated the distribu-tions were sufficiently apart from each other (Sec-tion 4.2).
This calls for a deeper analysis of com-plex network properties and their general applica-bility to tasks like genre identification (Stevanak etal., 2010).We further analyzed distributions of globalword network properties across six different net-work types within the same genre (Section 4.2).This time, however, we noted a significant amountof separation ?
both visually as well as statistically?
among the distributions of different global prop-erties (cf.
Figure 3 and Table 5).In our final set of experiments, we analyzedhow global network properties change as we startwith an empty network, and gradually add edgesto that network.
For this experiment, we chosethe news genre, and tracked the variation of 17different global network properties on four typesof networks.
We observed that all global net-work properties (except the number of vertices andedges, number of connected components and thesize of the largest connected component) show un-predictability and spikes when the percentage ofadded edges is small.
We also noted that mostglobal properties showed at least one phase transi-tion as the word collocation networks grew larger.Statistical significance tests indicated that the pat-terns of most global property variations were non-random and positively correlated (Section 4.3).2 Related WorkThat language shows complex network structureat the word level, was shown more than a decadeago by at least two independent groups of re-searchers (Ferrer i Cancho and Sol?e, 2001; Mat-suo et al., 2001a).
Matsuo et al.
(2001b) wentfurther ahead, and designed an unsupervised key-word extraction algorithm using the small-worldproperty of word collocation networks.
Motter etal.
(2003) extended the collocation network idea toconcepts rather than words, and observed a small-world structure in the resulting network.
Edgesbetween concepts were defined as entries in anEnglish thesaurus.
Liang et al.
(2009) comparedword collocation networks of Chinese and Englishtext, and pointed out their similarities and differ-ences.
They further constructed character collo-cation networks in Chinese, showed their small-world structure, and used these networks in afollow-up study to accurately segregate Chineseessays from different literary periods (Liang et al.,2012).Word collocation networks have also been suc-cessfully applied to the authorship attributiontask.1Antiqueira et al.
(2006) were among thefirst to apply complex network features like clus-tering coefficient, component dynamics deviationand degree correlation to the authorship attribu-tion problem.Biemann et al.
(2009) constructed syntacticand semantic distributional similarity networks(DSNs), and analyzed their structural differencesusing spectral plots.
Biemann et al.
(2012) furtherused graph motifs on collocation networks to dis-tinguish real natural language text from generatednatural language text, and to point out the short-comings of n-gram language models.Word collocation networks have been used byAmancio et al.
(2011) for opinion mining, and byMihalcea and Tarau (2004) for keyword extrac-tion.
While the former study used complex net-work properties as features for machine learningalgorithms, the latter ran PageRank (Page et al.,1998) on word collocation networks to sieve outmost important words.While all the above studies are very important,we found none that performed a thorough andsystematic exploration of different global networkproperties on different network types across gen-res, along with statistical significance tests to as-sess the validity of their observations.
Stevanaket al.
(2010), for example, used word collocationnetworks to distinguish between novels and newsarticles, but they did not perform a distributionalanalysis of the different global network propertiesthey used, thereby leaving open how good thoseproperties truly were as features for genre classifi-cation, and whether there exist a better and simplerset of global network properties for the same task.On the other hand, Masucci and Rodgers (2006),Ke (2007), and Ke and Yao (2008) explored sev-eral global network properties on word collocationnetworks, but they did not address the problem ofanalyzing within-genre and cross-genre variationsof those properties.1For details on authorship attribution, please see thesurveys by Juola (2006), Koppel et al.

The ones marked with an asterisk (?*?)
areonly used in Section 4.3 in the context of incrementally constructing networks by gradually adding edges.For document networks, these four properties do not make sense, because the number of connectedcomponents is always one, and the size of the largest connected component always equals the number ofvertices in the document network.
Note also that in-degree distribution, out-degree distribution, and thedirected version of diameter do not make sense for undirected networks, and same goes with the numberof strongly connected components and the size of the largest strongly connected component.
Here wereport them separately for conceptual clarity.98In addition to addressing these problems, inthis paper we introduce a new analysis - how theglobal network properties change as we graduallyadd more collocation edges to a network (Sec-tion 4.3).23 Collocation Networks of WordsBefore constructing collocation networks, we low-ercased the input text and removed all punctuation,but refrained from performing stemming in orderto retain subtle distinctions between words like?vector?
and ?vectorization?.
Six different typesof word collocation networks were constructed oneach document (used in Section 4.2) as well as ondocument collections (used in Section 4.3), wherenodes are unique words, and an edge appears be-tween two nodes if their corresponding words ap-peared together as a bigram or in a trigram inthe original text.
All the network types have thesame number of vertices (i.e., words) for a partic-ular document or a document collection, and theyare only distinguished from each other by the type(and potentially, number) of edges, as follows:Directed ?
Directed edge wA?
wBif wAwBisa bigram in the given text.Undirected, Variant 1 ?
Undirected edge wA?wBif wAwBis a bigram in the given text.Undirected, Variant 2 ?
Undirected edges wA?wB, wB?wCand wA?wC, if wAwBwCis a tri-gram in the given text.Directed Simplified ?
Same as the directed ver-sion, with self-loops removed.3Undirected Variant 1, Simplified ?
Same as theundirected variant 1, with self-loops removed.Undirected Variant 2, Simplified ?
Same as theundirected variant 2, with self-loops removed.We did not take into account edge weights inour study, and all our networks are therefore un-weighted networks.
Furthermore, since we re-moved all punctuation information before con-structing collocation networks, sentence bound-aries were implicitly ignored.
In other words, the2All code, data, and supplementary material are avail-able at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Mzhc7popBgODFKZVVnQTFMQkE/edit?usp=sharing.

thecorpora we used (cf.
Section 4.1), and code to construct thenetworks and analyze their properties.3Note that self-loops may appear in word collocation net-works due to punctuation removal in the pre-processing step.An example of such a self-loop is: ?The airplane took off.Off we go to Alaska.?
Here the word ?off?
will contain aself-loop.last word of a sentence does link to the first wordof the next sentence in our collocation networks.An example of the first three types of networks (di-rected, undirected variant 1, and undirected vari-ant 2) is shown in Figure 1.
Here we considereda sentence ?the quick brown fox jumped over thelazy dog?
as our document.
Note that all the col-location networks in Figure 1 contain at least onecycle, and the directed version contains a directedcycle.
In a realistic document network, there canbe many such cycles.We constructed word collocation networks ondocument collections as well.
In this case, the sixnetwork types remain as before, and the only dif-ference comes from the fact that now the wholecollection is considered a single super-document.Words in this super-document are connected ac-cording to bigram and trigram relationships.
Werespected document boundaries in this case, so thelast word of a particular document does not link tothe first word of the next document.
The collec-tion networks have only been used in Section 4.3of this paper, to show how global network proper-ties change as we add edges to the network.With the networks now constructed, we wentahead and explored several of their global prop-erties (cf.
Table 1).
Properties were measured oneach type of network on each document, therebygiving us property distributions across differentgenres of documents for a particular network type(cf.
Figure 2), as well as property distributionsacross different network types for a particulargenre (cf.
Figure 3).
We used the igraph softwarepackage (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) for computingglobal network properties.Among the properties in Table 1, number ofvertices (|V |) and number of edges (|E|) are self-explanatory.
The shrinkage exponent (log|V ||E|)is motivated by the observations that the numberof edges (|E|) follows a power-law relationshipwith the number of vertices (|V |), and that as a net-work evolves, both |V | and |E| continue to grow,but the diameter of the network either shrinks orplateaus out, thereby resulting in a densified net-work (Leskovec et al., 2007).
We explored twoversions of graph diameter (d) in our study - a di-rected version (considering directed edges), and anundirected version (ignoring edge directions).4The global clustering coefficient (C) is a mea-4For undirected collocation networks, these two versionsyield the same results, as expected.99sure of how interconnected a graph?s nodes areamong themselves.
It is defined as the ratiobetween the number of closed triplets of ver-tices (i.e., the number of ordered triangles ortransitive triads), and the number of connectedvertex-triples (Wasserman and Faust, 1994).
Thesmall-worldliness or proximity ratio (?)
of a net-work measures to what extent the network ex-hibits small-world behavior.
It is quantified asthe amount of deviation of the network from anequally large random network, in terms of av-erage local clustering coefficient (?C) and aver-age shortest path length (L)5.
The exact ratio is?
= (?C/L)/(?Crand/Lrand), where?C and L arethe average local clustering coefficient and the av-erage shortest path length of the given network,and?Crandand Lrandare the average local cluster-ing coefficient and the average shortest path lengthof an equally large random network (Walsh, 1999;Matsuo et al., 2001a).Since collocation networks have been found todisplay scale-free (power-law) degree distributionin several previous studies (see, e.g., (Ferrer iCancho and Sol?e, 2001; Masucci and Rodgers,2006; Liang et al., 2009)), we computed power-law exponents of in-degree, out-degree, and de-gree distributions on each of our collocation net-works.6We also computed the corresponding p-values, following a procedure outlined in (Clausetet al., 2009).
These p-values help assess whetherthe distributions are power-law or not.
If a p-valueis < 0.05, then there is statistical evidence to be-lieve that the corresponding distribution is not apower-law distribution.Finally, we computed the number of connectedcomponents, size of the largest (?giant?)
con-nected component, number of strongly connectedcomponents, and size of the largest strongly con-nected component, to be used in Section 4.3.4 Analysis of Network Properties4.1 DatasetsWe used four document collections from four dif-ferent genres ?
blogs, news articles, academic pa-pers, and digitized books.
For blogs, we used theBlog Authorship Corpus created by (Schler et al.,2006).
It consists of 19,320 blogs from authors5Also called ?characteristic path length?
(Watts andStrogatz, 1998).6For undirected graphs, the exponents on all three distri-butions are the same.of different age groups and professions.
The un-processed corpus has about 136.8 million word to-kens.Our news articles come from the Reuters-21578, Distribution 1.0 collection.7This collec-tion contains 19,043 news stories, and about 2.6million word tokens (unprocessed).For the academic paper dataset, we used NIPSConference Papers Vols 0-12.8This corpus com-prises 1,740 papers and about 4.8 million unpro-cessed word tokens.Finally, we created our own corpus of 3,036digitized books written by 142 authors from theProject Gutenberg digital library.9After re-moving metadata, license information, and tran-scribers?
notes, this dataset contains about 210.9million word tokens.That the word collocation networks of individ-ual documents are indeed scale-free and small-world, is evident from Tables 2, 3, and 4, andFigure 2h.
Irrespective of network type, a major-ity of the median ?
(power-law exponent of de-gree distribution) values hovers in the range [2, 3],with low dispersion.
This corroborates with ear-lier studies (Ferrer i Cancho and Sol?e, 2001; Lianget al., 2009; Liang et al., 2012).
Similarly, themedian ?
(small-worldliness) is high for all gen-res except news (irrespective of network type),thereby indicating the document networks are in-deed small-world.
This finding is in line with pre-vious studies (Matsuo et al., 2001a; Matsuo et al.,2001b).
Moreover, Figure 2h shows that a major-ity of documents in different genres have a veryhigh p-value, indicating that the networks are sig-nificantly power-law.
The news genre poses aninteresting case.
Since many news stories in theReuters-21578 collection are small, their colloca-tion networks are not very well-connected, therebyresulting in very low small-worldliness values, aswell as higher estimates of the power-law expo-nent ?

Histogramsfrom different genres are overlaid.
Note from Fig-ure 2e that most distributions are highly overlap-ping across different genres, thereby putting intoquestion if they are indeed suitable for genre iden-tification.
But when we performed ANOVA andKruskal-Wallis tests to figure out if the distribu-tions were similar or not across different gen-res, we observed that the corresponding p-valueswere all < 0.001 (cf.
Table 5, top two rows),thereby showing that at least a pair of mean valueswere significantly apart.
Follow-up experimentsusing unpaired t-tests, U-tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (all with Bonferroni Correction formultiple comparisons) showed that indeed almostall distributions across different genres were sig-nificantly apart from each other.
Detailed resultsare in the supplementary material.
This, we think,is an important and interesting finding, and needsto be delved deeper in future work.Figure 3 shows histograms of the eight proper-ties from Figure 2, but this time on a single genre(news articles), across different network types.This time we observed that many histograms aresignificantly apart from each other (see, e.g., Fig-ures 3b, 3c, 3e, and 3f).
ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests corroborated this finding (cf.
Table 5,bottom two rows).
Detailed results, including t-tests, U-tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests arein the supplementary material.4.3 Change of Global Network Propertieswith Gradual Addition of EdgesTo see how global network properties change aswe gradually add edges to a network, we tookthe whole news collection, and constructed a di-rected word collocation network on the whole col-lection, essentially considering the collection as asuper-document (cf.
Section 3).
We studied howproperties change as we consider top k% of edgesin this super-network, with k ranging from 1 to100 in steps of 1.
The result is shown in Fig-ure 4.
Note that the number of connected compo-nents and the number of strongly connected com-ponents increase first, and then decrease.
Thenumber of vertices, size of the largest stronglyconnected component, and size of the largest con-nected component increase monotonically as weconsider more and more collocation edges.
Forother properties, we see a lot of unpredictabilityand spikes (see, e.g., Figures 4d, 4e, 4g, and 4h),especially when the percentage of added edges issmall.
We performed Runs Test, Bartels Test, andMann-Kendall Test to figure out if these trends arerandom, and the resulting p-values indicate thatthey are not random, and in fact positively corre-lated (i.e., increasing).
Details of these tests arein the supplementary material.
Note also that allfigures except Figures 4a, 4k, and 4l show at leastone phase transition (i.e., a ?jump?

).5 ConclusionWe performed an exploratory analysis of globalproperties of word collocation networks acrossfour different genres of text, and across differentnetwork types within the same genre.
Our analy-ses reveal that cross-genre and within-genre vari-ations are statistically significant, and incrementalconstruction of collocation networks by graduallyadding edges leads to non-random and positivelycorrelated fluctuations in many global properties,some of them displaying single or multiple phasetransitions.
Future work consists of the inclusionof edge weights; exploration of other datasets, net-work properties, and network types; and applyingthose properties to the genre classification task.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to acknowledge Dr Rada Mihalceafor her support.
