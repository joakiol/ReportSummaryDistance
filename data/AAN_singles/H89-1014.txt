Speech Research at Carnegie MellonPrincipal Investigator: Raj ReddyCarnegie Mellon has been active in speech recognition research for over 20 years.
Research in the 70'shave led to important systems uch as Hearsay, Harpy, and Dragon.
Since 1980, the Carnegie Mellonspeech group has been exploring techniques for speaker-independent r cognition.
Various avenues wereexplored, including a knowledge ngineering approach to identify robust speech features that areindependent of speaker and environment, and a statistical learning system that utilized human knowledgeand detailed speech modeling.The latter system, Sphinx, was demonstrated in 1987.
It is the first recognition system that couldaccurately recognize continuous speech from a large vocabulary by any speaker, without raining.
Thiswas accomplished through the availability of ample training, the use of a powerful learning algorithm,and the design of detailed speech models.
Currently, Sphinx has a word accuracy of about 96% using aword-pair grammar with perplexity 60.
In 1988, Sphinx was ported to the Beam search accelerationmachine, which made real-time recognition a reality.
In 1988, the Minds System was demonstrated.Minds used Sphinx and Beam, and demonstrated the utility of dialog and semantic knowledge inimproving recognition accuracy.The overall goal of speech research at Carnegie Mellon is to develop new technologies that address themajor problems currently inhibiting automatic speech recognition in realistic environrnents.
Areas forfuture work include:?
Improved Recognition Techniques - -  We plan to develop a 5000- to 20,000-wordvocabulary, speaker independent, connected speech, spoken English recognition system withgrammar perplexity of approximately 200.
To obtain a high accuracy on such a difficult ask,we must improve Sphinx substantially.
We plan to investigate better subword modeling,improved learning algorithms, and rapid configuration for new vocabularies and tasks.?
Fluent Human/Machine Interfaces - -  We will investigate, measure, and improve the utilityof speech in several day-to-day interactive tasks that involve collaborative, human/computerproblem solving.?
Acoustical and Environmental Robustness - -  We will improve the robustness of Sphinxagainst changes in microphone, noise characteristics, and environmental acoustics.
Areas ofresearch include employing multiple microphones, noise-subtracting, and homomorphicfiltering.?
Understanding Spontaneous Spoken Language - -  We will work on the problematicphenomena associated with spontaneous speech, such as repetitions and restarts, speech-likenoise ("um"s and "ah"s), and interruptions.
The "missing science" includes techniquesfor understanding fragmentary input and for parsing in the presence of errors.?
Task Semantics and Pragmatics - -  Our recent research on the Minds system has shownthat effective use of knowledge from dialogue, task-level semantics, and user models canreduce perplexity over ten fold.
In the future, we intend to demonstrate the utility of suchtechniques in a wide range of domains.119
