Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Computational Semantics, page 2,Tilburg, January 2009. c?2009 International Conference on Computational SemanticsInvited TalkKnowing a word(sense) by its companyMartha PalmerDepartment of LinguisticsUniversity of ColoradoBoulder, Colorado, USAMartha.Palmer@colorado.eduAbstractSupervised word sense disambiguation requires training corpora thathave been tagged with word senses, and these word senses typically comefrom a pre-existing sense inventory.
Space limitations imposed by dictio-nary publishers have biased the field towards lists of discrete senses for anindividual lexeme.
This approach does not capture information about relat-edness of individual senses.
How important is this information to knowingwhich sense distinctions are critical for particular types of NLP applications?How much does sense relatedness affect automatic word sense disambigua-tion performance?
Recent psycholinguistic evidence seems to indicate thatclosely related word senses may be represented in the mental lexicon muchlike a single sense, whereas distantly related senses may be represented morelike discrete entities.
These results suggest that, for the purposes of WSD,closely related word senses can be clustered together into a more generalsense with little meaning loss.
This talk will describe the relatedness of verbsenses and its impact on NLP applications and WSD components as well asrecent psycholinguistic research results.2
