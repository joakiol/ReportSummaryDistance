The systemconsists of a lexicon input and maintenance module,a lexicon output module for accessing lexical wordforms, a two-level rule compiler and a two-levelmorphological analysis/synthesis unit.
The basicparadigms and lexical alternations of word forms arehandled by the lexicon system, while the two-levelcomponent akes care of phonologically inducedalternations.1.
IntroductionWe present an integrated environment formorphological analysis of (written) word-forms ofthe Slovene language.
The language belongs to theSlavic family of languages, but exhibits some veryidiosyncratic properties (e.g.
having also a "dual"number and very rich inflection).
Our project ofwriting a morphological analyzer and synthesizer(MAS) for the Slovene language has had primarilytwo aims.
First, to write a useful MAS, which couldserve as a front-end to other Slovene languageprocessing systems, and second, to implement amodel general enough to allow us to facilitate thestudy of Slovene morphology.The work on the project itself is split into two partsmuch along the same lines.
First of the task ofselecting and implementing a model versatile noughto cover the quirks of Slovene morphology, andsecond, the task of writing down the rules of Slovenemorphology (Toporigi~ 84) in the formalism of thechosen model.The two-level model of Kimmo Koskeniemmi(Karttunen 88, Koskenniemi 84,85,86) was selectedas the basic scheme for our MAS, our choice beinginfluenced - among other things - by its prevalence incurrent (computer) morphological studies.
Thismakes the system well documented and thus easy toimplement, as well as simplifying the task of writingthe rules for (phonologically) induced alternations ofSlovenian word-forms (Erjavec 89).2.
StructureThe system was implemented on VAX/VMS inQuintus Prolog and consists of the following parts:(1) The compiler, which takes as its input two-levelrules and produces final state automata(transducers).
(2) The lexicon module which provides a userinterface for the creation and updating of thelexicon - the lexicon input module.
This moduleembodies that part of morphological knowledgeof Slovene inflectional morphology which cannotbe (elegantly) covered by two-level rules.
It isalso the part of the system responsible forpassing lexical word forms to (3) - the lexiconoutput module.
(3) The MAS itself, which, having access to thetransducers and (indirectly) to the lexicon, is ableto analyze Slovene word forms into their lexicalcounterparts, and to synthesize word forms fromlexical data.1TWO-LEVELCOMPILER~ - ~ /  MASMODULE' O-'EVELWORD-FORMUSER INPUTOF NEW WORDSSURFACE lWORD FORM \[ LEXICON INIU.
r l MODULE1 LEXICONFigure 1: System structureAs we can see, the MAS with its knowledge ofphono-morphological alternations embodied in thetransducers guides the lexicon module in choosing86 \]the correct lexical word from the lexicon.
The MASmodule is of course also able to synthesize words,given their lexical representation.
The "feeding" oflexical words to the MAS is however applicationdependent, and will thus not be dealt with further inthis paper.
The workings of the compiler will also notbe discussed, as this is not its first implementation(Karttunen 87).3.
Lex icon  modu leA basic part of our MAS system is the lexicon.
Thestructure of the lexicon accords with the two-levelmodel type lexicon; that is, the lexicon is composedof letter-.tree sub-lexicons (tries), consisting ofmorphemes with a common property.
We can have,for instance, a sub-lexicon for stems, another forendings of male noun declension, another forconjugative ndings of certain verbs, etc.
A set ofsub-lexicons is marked as initial, meaning that a(recognizable) word can only start with a member ofthese sub-lexicons.
The other sub-lexicons areconnected to initial sub-lexicons through pointers,typically making them inflectional paradigms ofvarious 'word classes.An entry in a sub-lexicon consists of three parts:(1) the "morpheme", which, in stem sub-lexicons(two-level rules aside), is the invariant part of thestem lexeme, written in the symbols of the lexicalalphabet;(2) the continuation lexicon(s) of the morpheme;(3) morpho-syntactic features of the morpheme.To illustrate:bolezEn decl_subst_f2 / bv=subst gen=fem;(1) (2) (3)(1) - the stem of the lexeme "illness"; the lexicalsymbol "E" denotes an unstressed "e" (schwa sound),deleted in word forms with non-null endings("bolezen" - nom.
sg., but "bolezni" - gen.
sg.
);(2) - the name of the lexicon with endings of secondfemale declension;(3) - inherent morpho-syntactic properties of thelexeme (noun, female gender).We can see that the lexicon system can take care ofregular paradigms of inflecting words of the language(at least for suffixing languages, such as Slovene),while the two-level rules handle phono-morphological alternations.
The Slovene language,however, abounds in alternations that are lexicallyconditioned.
This is not to say that no rules can beconstructed to cover these alternations, but ratherthat they are not (purely) phonologicallyconditioned.
There is for instance an alternation thataffects only nouns of male gender which have the"animate" property, and another one which pertainsonly to the plural and dual of certain Slovene nouns.Since two-level rules are sensitive only to the form ofthe word (string) they proces, they are insufficient forexpressing such alternations.To handle lexically conditioned types of alternations,we have concentrated on the linking mechanismbetween the sub-lexicons.
The "continuation"information belonging to an entry can also, alongwith a pointer to another sub-lexicon, include a list oftexical alternations.
When accessing word forms fromthe lexicon, these alternations tell the lexicon outputmodule how to modify the continuation sub-lexiconto express the desired changes.
The rules governingsuch modifications of the continuation sub-lexiconcan perform a certain number of primitive"transformational" operations on the sub-lexicon inquestion.To make the point clearer, we give a simple case ofan alternation that affects certain nouns of malegcnder.
The alternation "j epenthesis" inserts a "j" inthe stem final position in word forms with a non-nullending; e.g.
"krompir" -potato, but "krompirja" forthe singular genitive form.
The lexicon entry lookslike this:krompir decl_subst_m(pod j) /bv=subst gen=mas -anim;When the lexicon output module "jumps" to thecontinuation lexicon, the "pod_j" item will trigger thecorresponding alternation in the morphological rulebase of the system.
The alternation procedure thentakes as its input the continuation lexicon, modifiesit, and returns the modified lexicon (with "j" prefixedto the non-null gramatemes).
Analysis then proceedswith entries of the modified lexicon.4.
Input  Modu leIf new entries are to be added to our lexicon bypersons not acquainted with implementation detailsof the system (lexical alphabet and alternations), aninput module with a friendly user interface is ofprime importance.
In our system the user is thereforeexpected to enter only the base form of the new word(e.g.
nom.
sg.
for nouns) along with inherentmorpho-syntactic properties of the word (e.g.
noun,male, animate), and another "comparative" wordform of the same word (e.g.
gen.
pl.).
Bothword-forms are entered in the surface alphabet.2 87With this information at its disposal, the inputmodule must, in order to store the entry into thelexicon, do the following:- extract form the word its lexical stem;- transcribe it from surface into lexical characters;- determine the continuation lexicon(s) (paradigms)and lexical alternations;Extracting the lexical stem and assigning lexicalalternations are performed by comparing the (baseand comparative) word forms entered.
For examplethe comparison of "ladja" (ship) and "ladij" (gen.
pl.
)shows an insertion of 'T' into the stem, so the nameof the lexical alternation for 'T' epenthesis addedto the entry.The "lemmatization" of words, especially themapping from surface to lexical symbols, is basicallynondeterministic; .e.
the input module "guesses" thecorrect lemmatization of the word, produces thelexical word form of the comparative word, andsynthesizes its surface word form.
If the synthesizedword-form matches the one entered by the user, thelemmatization is correct; if not, the module triesagain, with a different mapping.the Study of Language and Information, ReportNo.

Conc lus ionOur system is in a certain sense redundant, since ithas two ways with dealing with alternations -two-level rules and lexicon rules.
The two-level rulesare more linguistically justified, while the lexiconrules offer greater power in expressing alternations.This (partial) overlap is to a large extent intentional,as Slovene morphology has been - to say the least -insufficiently studied and our aim was to have at ourdisposal a variety of tools for expressing variousmorphological processes which occur in ourlanguage.
'We have also tried to simplily the input of new wordsinto the lexicon; a problem which in our opinion, hasreceived insufficient attention in the two-levelframework.6.
