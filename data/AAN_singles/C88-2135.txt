A Computer Readability Formula of Japanese Texts for MachineScoringTATEISI Yuka, ONO Yoshihiko, YAMADA ltisaoDepartment of Information Science, Faculty of Science, University of Tokyo,7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113, JapanAbstractA readability formula is obtained that can be used by com-puter programs for style checking of Japanese texts and need notsyntactic or semantic information.
The formula is derived as alinear combination of tile surface characteristics of the text that arerelated to its readability: (1) the average number of characters persentence, (2) for each type of characters (Roman alphabets, kanzis,hiraganas, katakanas), relative frequencies of rims (maximalswings) that ,:onsists only of that type of characters, (3) the averagenumber of characters per each type of runs, and (4) tooten(comma) to kuten (period) ratio.To find the proper weighting, principal component analysis(PCA) was appliedto these characteristics taken from 77 sampletexts.We have found a component which is related to the readabil-ity.
Its scores match to the empirical knowledges of reading ease.We have also obtained experimental confirmation that the com-ponent is an adequate measure for stylistic ease of reading, by thecloze procedure and by the examination on the average lime takento fill out one blank of the cloze texts.1o IntroductionThis study aims to obtain a readability formula that can beused by computer programs for style checking of Japanese texts.
Areadability formula predicts the difficulty of a document that mayresult from its writing style, but not from its content, organization,or format.
A readability index is calculated from the measures ofsurface characteristics of the document that are thought to indicatethe stylistic difficulty without an attempt to parse sentences or toconsult a large dictionary.Many of the readability formulae for English, (for example,Flesch's Reading Ease Score/Fleseh 1949/and Automated Reada-bility Index/Smith 1970/), use the average length (number of syll-ables or lettors) of words and the average number of words in sen-tences in a document for calculating the readability index.
Wordlength is a measure of the lexical difficulty, i.e., difficulty of thevocabulary used in the document.
Sentence l ngth is a measure ofthe Syntactic difficulty or complexity of the sentence.
While reaodability indices are derived from simple formulae, they predict rea-sonably well the difficulty of a document.
This is because the sen-tence length and the word length are highly correlated withfeatures uch as the complexity of the sentence and the difficultyof the word, respectively.Existing scoring methods for Japanese, such as the one pro-posed by/Morioka 1958/or/Yasumoto 1983/, use the sentencolength measured in letters instead of words and the percentage ofkanzis (Chinese characters), the latter used for estimating thedifficulty of the vocabulary.
Both rate the average number ofletters per sentence and the percentage of kanzis in the textindependen|ly and do not combine the two factors into a singleindex.
A te~t with longer sentences i estimated as difficult, and atext with more kanzis is also estimated as difficult.
Morioka, whosurveyed on school textbooks, showed that the upper grade text-books contain longer sentences on the average and more kanzi.Yasumoto states that documents with more kanzi are less readableeven for adults, for the following reason.
Kanzi are logograms,one roughly corresponding to a word.
Documents using morekanzis, therefore, apt to include more different words and shoulddemand more reading skill.A problem of rating the sentence l ngth and the percentage ofkanzi independently is that these two may yield an inconsistent rat-ing.
Generally, a sentence becomes longer if its kanzis are rewrit-ten in kanas.
Thus sentence lengths depend on representations.There seems to have been no attempt on combining the factors ofsentence l ngth and the proportion of kanzi.
On the other hand, norationale is given for the separate measurements.
It is possible toderive a single index that can assess readability of Japanese text./Sakamoto 1967/proposed a method of scoring the relativedifficulty of children's books to match the reading skill of theintended readers.
His method consists of three independent rat-ings; (1) the proportion of fundamental words based on/Sakamoto1958/, (2) the proportion of sentences that are made of more than10 words, and (3) the proportion of kanzi.
However, Sakamoto'smethod introduce the problem of measuring sentence length inwords in place of tile conflict between sentence length andrepresentation.Using word count o1' word length as an estimator of readabil-ity is not practical in the case of Japanese.
Since Japanese doesnot use word segmentations i  nomaal writing, dividing sentencesinto words needs parsing and consulting dictionary.
Thus, a scor-ing method based on words, such as Sakamoto's, is costly.
This isespecially so when scoring is done by a computer, because xtradevices uch as parsers, a large dictionary, and, sometimes, eman-tic analyzers are required for word segmentation alone.Another problem with the traditional scoring methods is thatthey have ignored katakana, which are used to represent foreignwords.
Recent documents, especially scientific and technical ones,use a lot of foreign words.
/Watanabe 1983/reports that, in ayear's issues of the Jonrual of lnfonnation Processing Society ofJapan, Vol.
17, about an eighth among the characters used is kata-kana.
/Satake 1982/surveyed the article of magazines publishedtoday and found that the ratio of katakana ranged from 4.44 to13.75 percent.
Thus percentage of katakana is not negligible inscoring today's documents.
Katakana words mean importedforeign words, old and new, which are often unfamiliar to readers.Yet existing measures take into account only kanzi and areinsufficient to score the today's technically oriented ocuments.2.
Factors of ReadabilityWe have chosen the following four surface characteristics afactors of readability:(1) relative frequency of characters for each type of characters,(2) the length of a run (maximal string that consists of one typeof characters),.
(3) the length of a sentence, and(4) the number of tooten s (commas) per sentence.The former two are related to the difficulty of vocabulary in adocument; he latter two are related to the complexity of sentencesin a document.649Character FrequenciesThe most common Japanese writing system is based on themixture of kanzis, kanas (hiraganas and katakanas), the Romanalphabets, Arabic numerals, and some other alphabets and sym-bols.
Almost al!
normal writing is a mixture of kanzis, hiraganas,and katakanas (and others).
Frequencies of types of characters in aJapanese text are known to affect its readability at least in the fol-lowing manner: Kanzi, as mentioned before, are considered tomake texts difficult.
Since katakana nd alphabets are used forforeign words, high frequencies of these characters indicate thatthe text contain many unfamiliar words.
Hiragana are used torepresent the rest of the text and more of them are considered tomake texts easier.
There is no rigid orthography for Japanese.Nevertheless, the way an adult Japanese spells out a sentence inusual writing is roughly fixed.
Kanzis are used for nouns and forthe root parts of verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and the like.
Hiraganasare used to write inflections and other grammatical parts of sen-tences, and katakanas are used mainly for the transcription offoreign words.
So in passages written in the common way, the useof types of characters, i.e., kanzi, hiragana, katakana, etc., reflectsthe use of vocabulary and can be an' indicator of the difficulty ofthe passage.It is possible to write the words usually written in kanzi inhiragana.
However, psychological experiments such as the onesconducted by /Kitao 1960/ or /Hirose 1983/ a reader finds itdifficult to read the texts represented in the way unfamiliar to thereader.
In Kitao's experiment, subjects took less time to read andrecognize the word or the sentence written in a common way thanwritten solely in hiragana.
In Hirose's experiment, the words usu-ally written in kanzi are harder to recognize than the words usuallywritten in kana when both type of words are written in kana.
Bothresults show that words or sentences in the representation more- familiar to a reader are more readable than those in less familiarrepresentation.RunsIn the ordinary representation, a boundary of the types ofcharacters corresponds to the boundary of words or smaller gram-matical parts thereof.
That is, a series of letters of the same type inthe text, bounded by other character types corresponds toa word ora smaller grammatical part.
We will call such a series a run, i.e., arun is a maximal string that consists of only one type of characters.It is not a grammatical unit.
Usually, a run corresponds to one ormore words.
A verb or an adjective is often found across two runs.Such a word norulally has its root part written in kanzi and itsinflection part in hiragana.As the boundary of runs roughly correspond to the boundaryof words, the different graphic appearance of kanzi and kanaletters helps a reader to parse a sentence.
Hence, long runs, whenthey happen, hide the word boundaries and makes a sentence l ssreadable.Long kanzi runs give another problem to the readability.Kango.
can be formed into a compound word simply by con-catenating two or more of them successively.
The meaning of thenew word is formed by the meanings of its elements.
However,how each element is related to each other in the compound word isnot clear from mere concatenation.
A reader must pragmaticallysee the relation.
Therefore, it is often the case that the meaning ofa compound kango is ambiguous.
For example, siken-ki can beread as siken-suru-kikai (testing machine) or as siken-sareru-kikai(machine to be tested); rinzi-kyouiku-singi-kai meaning rinzi-ni-kyouiku-ni-tuite-singi-suru-kai (an ad hoe council to deliberate oneducation) can be read as rinzi-no-kyouiku-ni-tuite-singi-suru-kai(a council to deliberate on an ad hoe education).650It is unlikely that there may be any good theory possibleabout the relationship between run frequencies and readability.Nevertheless, the run frequencies may be used in a similar manneras character f equencies.
In a study preceding this/Tateisi 1987/we found that the run frequencies are correlated with the frequen-cies of the character of corresponding types (0.6 < r < 0.9, depend-ing on character types) and a unit of run is sufficient o obtain theinformation otherwise supplied by both characters and runs.Sentence LengthThe length of sentences i a known factor of readability as/Morioka 1958/and other surveys how.
In Japanese, as in otherlanguages, long sentences tend to have complicated structures.Sentence length can be measured in the number of charactersit contains.
Though Sakamoto's urvey of children's textbook/Sakamoto 1963/shows that the number of words per sentences ia more accurate indicator of the grade level than the number ofcharacters, it also shows that the two are in good proportion, thecorrelation coefficient being 1.00.PunctuationTootens, like commas, are put at the end of a phrase.
Thenumber of tootens per sentence corresponds to the number ofphrases per sentence.
/Hayasi 1959/found that junior high schoolsU:dents and senior high students understood the text more pre-cisely if modifying phrases are separated and made intoindependent sentences.
Following this result, a sentence withsmaller number of phrase is easier to understand.
/Kozuru 1987/found that the average number of tootens in a sentence increaseswith student's grade level.
These findings indicate that the numberof tootens in a sentence is greater in more difficult-to-read texts.Thus, the number of tootens is a factor of readability.3.
The Method of AnalysisWe shall first extract several numerical characteristics ofstyle from texts and then derive a readability formula as a linearcombination of the values of those characteristics.
A nurflericalindex is only a rough scale of readability.
It should be calculatedwith simple devices and methods.
We use character as the unit ofmeasuring length for the sake of simple calculation.Several surface characteristics are extracted from the materi-als.
Difference of the characteristics among materials consists ofseveral factors.
It may be factored into variation of the topic areaof the texts, and the variation of style.
Style may differ by thewriter or by the intentions of the text.
Introductory textbooksshould be written easier than technical papers intended for expertsand the authors will be careful not to make it difficult to read.Thus they will be written in a style easier to read than the style oftechnical papers.
Translations tend to have a particular style,highly dependent on the syntax of the original anguage.
The par-ticular style of translations is often found awkward as Japanese andless readable.
The distinctive feature of the texts with differentintentions can be used as a criteria of assessing readability.To find the distinctive feature of texts from the surfacecharacteristics, the principal component analysis (PCA) extractsfactors of variance of the characteristics.
We will then examinetile components, by comparing component scores for the materialswith the empirical knowledges of readability.
In this way we shallchoose a component relevant to the stylistic readability.
A princi-pal component is a linear combination of the variables.
The for-mula which computes the component can be used as a readabilityformula.VariablesWe have chosen the ten variables that represent the four fac~tots of readal~ility:(1) for each type of characters((Roman) lphabets, kanzis, hira-ganas, katakanas), relative frequency of runs (maximalstrings) that consists only of that type of characters,(2) the avelage number of letters per each type of runs,(3) the avelage number of letters per sentence, and(4) tooten lo kuten ratio.Sentence lengfl~ is measured in the number of charactersbetween two adjacent sentence-ending marks (kuten, exclamationmarks, and question marks).
Kuten, unlike period, is placed onlyat the end of a sentence, not as an indicator of abbreviations.Therefore, the end of a sentence is ahnost always detected bydetecting kuten, although the end quotation embedded in a sen-tence is also counted as the end of a sentence.SamplesWe must compare the readability anaong the texts written intile common way, that is, the texts written by authors as they are.For exampl~, the textbooks for elementary school children areinadequate.
This is because those textbooks are written in anunusual way.
They use hiragana where most adults use kanzi, tran-scribing the kanzi the readers are not expected to learn yet.We will therefore take the documents written by adults foradults as materials of the analysis.Seventy-seven (77) documents were selected as sample textsto extract he data from.
Seventy of the samples are machine-readable documents hat were stored in our laboratory.
They aretechnical papers, textbooks for collage students, and translations ofcomputer science materials, written by 13 authors.
Seven of thesamples are included as indicators for reading ease.
Five of theseindicators a~e text judged as easy.
Three of therft are taken fromthe books on technical writing; two are taken from essays for gen-eral readers.
They are considered to be easier than the papers ortextbooks for scientists.
The remaining two are the text judged asdifficult.
One of them is a decision on the case of an infringementof copyright of a computer program; the other is a juridical paperabout copyright and new media such as magnetic tapes.
Juridicaltexts are empirically known as hard to read.Tables~ figures, references, and expressions which aredisplayed iitdependently from the passage are deleted from tilesamples.4.
Result of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)The plincipal component analysis is done by S routines/Becker 1984/on Vax 8600 at the Computer Center of the Univer-sity of Tokyo.
The components and the loadings of each variablesare shown in table 4--1.The first three components (eigenvalue > 1) are examined.Total variance xplained by these components is 70%.
Figure 4-1shows the s,:atter plot of sample texts.
The letter i designate intro-ductory textbooks, m magazine articles other than technicalpapers, p tt~chnical papers, t and T designate translations fromEnglish papers, and D and E designate the difficult and easy indi-cators, respectively.The following are observed for the first component.
(1-1) This component reflects the occurrences of alphabets;separates the texts with little alphabetic content and the textaburtdant with alphabetic content.
(1-2) The texts with many equations and abbreviations have highscor,~s on this component.The sc.0re on this component shows the area of topic.The following are observed for the second component.
(2-1) This component separates the texts with long sentences andlong kanzi runs from the other texts.
(2-2) The component score agrees with human judgement abouteasy/difficult texts.
It is high on tile texts judged easy andlow on the texts judged difficult.
The second componentscore shows the distinction more clearly than the first or thethird.
(2-3) Introductory textbooks have generally higher scores thanpapers.
Again, the second component score shows the dis-tinction more clearly than tile first or file third.Since long sentences and long kanzi runs make texts lessreadable as stated before, (2-1) indicates that the second com-ponent can be an indicator of readability.
(2-2) and (2-3) also indi-cates that he second component is related to readability.The third component shows a difference of proportions ofkatakana nd kanzi.
From table 4-1 we can find that the variableson kanzi have positive loadings and the variables on hiragana ndkatakana have negative loadings on the component.
Thus, thecomponent shows the proportion of kanzi, in the way that itincreases with texts with more kanzi.5.
Principal Component Scores and StyleWe have observed tile following phenomena on the secondcomponent.Improvement and Principal Component ScoresFive of the sample texts are chapters (indicated T in thefigure 4-1) of the final versions of the translation of an Englishpaper by different translators.
Their component scores were com-pared with those of tile respective draft versions.
(The drafts arenot among the samples.)
The first three component scores of thefinal manuscripts were uniformly higher than those of drafts, i.e.,tile scores became higher with the improvement of their style.
Thedifferences between the final versions and the respective draft ver-sions are shown in table 5-1.
The mean difference of the secondeomponent is found greater than that of the first at the 5 percentsignificance (17 = 0.044) and greater than that of the third at the 10percent significance but not at the 5 percent significance(19 = 0.098).
Thus, the difference of the second component isgreater than the other two.
This agrees with the observations onthe distribution of texts, that is, easier-to-read texts have highersecond component score than difficult ones, since a text becomeseasier to read after improvement i  general.Frequencies ofPassive FormsTable 5-2 below shows tile correlation between the com-ponent scores and the frequencies of passive.
Passive forms arecounted using the pattern matching method proposed by/Ushijima1987/.
The count is divided by the number of the kutens in a sam-ple, yielding the ratio to passives per sentences, o1' sentence-endings.Japanese passive forms are also used for potentials.
Forexample, mirareru may mean either be seen (passive) o1' can see(potential) and taberareru may have one of three meanings: beeaten, can eat, and can be eaten.
Thus, frequent use of passivestend to make a doc~ment vague and less readable.The second component scores have a higher correlation thanother component scores.
Note that the correlation coefficient isnegative.
This agrees with the observation that the second com-ponent score is lower on difficult-to-read texts and that the fre-quency of passives i higher on such texts.Figure 5-1 shows the plot of the second component scoresand the frequencies ofpassives per 1000 sentences.
The line in thefigure is the regression line.6516.
The Derived FormulaThe results above support he adequacy of the second com-ponent as a scale of readability.
To summarize, the second com-ponent score may be used as a readability index because of the fol-lowing facts.
(1) The component score agrees with human judgement abouteasy/difficult texts.
Easier-to-read texts yield higher valuedscores.
(2) Introductory materials give higher scores than technicalpapers,(3) The score increases as the result of improvement by editingof texts,(4) The frequencies of passive forms have a negative correlation(-0.53) with the component score.The first component and the third component do not possess all ofthese properties.
Thus the second is a better measure of readabilitythan the first or the third.The second component score is transformed so that the meanon those 77 samples equals 50, the standard eviation equals 10,and let the value be higher on easy texts.
This yields formula,RS = 0.06 xpa  + 0.25 xph - 0.19 xpc  - 0.61 xpk-1.34 x Is -1.35 x la + 7.52 x lh - 22.1 ?
lc - 5.3 x lk-3.87 x cp - 109.1where pa, ph, pc,  pk are the percentages of alphabet runs, hira-gana runs, kanzi runs, and katakana mns, respectively; Is is theaverage numbers of letters per sentence; la, lh, lc, Ik are the aver-age numbers of letters per alphabet run, hiragana run, kanzi run,and katakana run, respectively;and cp is the tooten to kuten ratio.7.
Validation of the Derived FormulaWe have also obtained experimental conformation on theidea that the RS is an adequate measure for stylistic ease of read-ing, by the cloze procedure/Taylor 1953/,/Shiba 1957/.Cloze procedure judges the relative reading difficulty of textsto a particular population.
This difficulty mostly related to thecontent of the text.
Suppose readers have no backgroundknowledge of the content.
They are not likely to be able to fill ablanked-out word where a technical term or some other word thatrequires the knowledge of the area the content belongs to be filledin.
In such cases, the cloze score or the doze percentage becomeslow for the text even if an experts finds it very easy to read.Stylistic difficulty may be also measured by this procedure,according to the experiment of \]Kitao 1960/.
In the experimentsubsequent to the one mentioned in the previous section, herequired the subjects to perform the cloze procedure on twomaterials; the same text represented in two different ways.
One isin the usual representation, mixing kanzi and kana; the other iswritten entirely in hiragana.
The cloze score of the usual form washigher than the one entirely in kana.
This result was consistentwith the result hat the subjects required longer time in reading thetext entirely in kana, as mentioned in section 2.As the cloze procedure scores both the difficulty of style andthe difficulty of the content, another measure is needed to confirmthat our formula is a measure of the stylistic readability.
For thispurpose, we recorded the total time each subject ook to completea cloze text.
The recorded time was divided by the number ofblanks, thus converted into the average time taken to fill out oneblank.The process a subject akes to fill out a blank is composed offour phases, i.e.,652(1) the phase of reading the incomplete text and understand thecontent of the passage,(2) the phase of surmising what is missing (as a notion),(3) the phase of choosing the proper word to supplement, and(4) the phase of writing down that word.The time for writing down a word is fairly constant, unless theword contains extremely complicated kanzi.
Therefore, the varia-tion of time from text to text is the variation of time for the phase(1), (2), and (3), i.e., understanding the passage, surmising themissing notion, and choosing the proper word.
The text which isstylistically difficult takes more time in the phase (1).
Thus thedifficult-to-read texts must require more time filling out blanksthan easy-to-read ones.MaterialsThe materials of the experiment, denoted by p 1 through p 6,were taken from the six sample papers among the 77 used for thePCA.
Each was about 500 characters in size.
Three of them (p 1,p 2, p 3) had high RS s (RS > 50) and the three (p 4, p 5, a 6) hadlow RS s (RS < 50).Every eighth word of each text was blanked out, i.e., the pro-portion of blanked out words to the whole words was 12.5%.
Tenunderscore ('_') characters were put where a word was blankedout.
Among several different definitions of Japanese words used,the one which gives the smallest unit was taken.
The materialswere printed out on a sheet of A4-sized paper, one material perpaper.Twenty-eight subjects (25 undergraduate students and 3 gra-duate students) participated in the experiment.
Each subject wasassigned three materials fi~m p 1 -p  6 selected randomly, so thatthe half of the subjects were assigned each material.
The subjectswere required to fill blanks (underscored parts) with words theythought most appropriate to the context, taking as much time theyneed.
The subjects were told that each word-unit was smallestpossible, and therefore the deleted part might not match what theythink is a word.
The subjects were also told that the materials thatthey had were independent from each other.At the same time, the subjects were required to record thetime when he/she start to fill out each paper, i.e., one material, andwhen he/she completed, for each paper, to the unit of seconds.ResultsCompleted sheets, expect for one by a subject who gave upthe procedure in the middle are analyzed.
Whether the word filledin matched the original or not was judged according to /Shiba1957/.
Some sheets are without the record of the time.
Suchsheets are included for calculation of doze pereen\[ages butexcluded from the analysis of time.
The eloze percentages and themedians of the time taken to fill a blank are shown in table 7-1.The cloze percentages were higher on texts with higher RS,although the correlation was not statistically significant (the corre-lation coefficient between cloze percentages and RS s is 0.295).For the analysis of time taken, the texts were divided into twocategories; the ones with RS > 50 and the ones with RS < 50.
Theaverage time for filling a blank was compared between the twocategories of the texts using the median test.
The result is shownin table 7-2.
The difference of the time for filling a blank isshorter on texts with high RS s.In addition, we compared a document and its rewritten ver-sion by the same procedure.
The material r 1 was taken from thefinal report of rinzi-kyouiku-singikai (National Council of Educa-tional Reform) of Japanese Government.
The document r 1 had anextremely low score (RS = 27).
The material r2 was rewrittenfrom r 1 by di?iding long sentences into shorter sentences and sub-stituting Japanese words for words of Chinese origin.
The inte.u-tion of the rewriting is to increase RS.
The RS of the rewrittentext is 47, nearly the average of the sample texts of PCA (= 5(I).The cloze percentage and the average time for fl l ing a blank iscompm'ed con(pared as above.
The cloze percentage of rite rewrit-ten version r2 was 59.6 %, higher than that of the original r 1(56.6 %).
The average time for billing a blank is shorter for therewritten version than for the original (the mexlian was 9.6 sec.
forr2  and 10.9 see.
for r 1).
The median test of time eompadug thetwo materials showed that the difference was not statisticallysignificant ()~:~ :- 0).These ret;ults how that(1) the subjects take shorter time with the texts of higher RS inunderstanding and guessing the nfissing words of the text,than wilh the text of lower RS, though the result is not statist-ieally significant, and that(2) the subjt:cts guess the missing words in the high RS textsmore co~ cectly than those in the low RS texts.The difi'erenee il~ time a subjecl spent to fill one blank in the twotypes of texts is significant, by the median test.These rcudts did not show that RS is related to the difficultyof the content or the vocabulary of the texts, ttowever, RS isrelated to the stylistic difiiculty, that is, RS show the ~vlativedifficulty of {:mnsfb,mation from the text itself to the content.Therefore, RS is judged useful to measure the readability of textsin general.We judged that the clozc score is more relatexl to thedifficulty of the content han to the difficulty of the style.
There--fore we introduced another measure tbr stylistic difficulty.
A com.rnent fi'om the experimental subject who gave up the procedurecoufit'ms on, judgement to be reasonable.
Ile gave up |he taskbecause he has not enough knowledge of the m'ea of these texts,especially, of technical papers.g.
Concluding RemarksWe have: derived a readability formula ti'orh the multivariateanalysis on wtriance of surface characteristics of Japanese techni-cal documents intended for adult readers.The mean, file minimum, and the maximum v'alue of RS over theseveral types of texts are shown in table 8-.1.As with all indices, RS can be increased by revision whichdues not necessarily enhance readability.
For example, if a text iswritten entirely in hiragana and the sentences are cut into shortshorter ones, lh and ph increases and Is decreases.
This revisionyields greater value of RS but does not produce the text easier toread.
The formula shmdd be applied to the texts written in thecommon way To construct an index that is sensitive to the unrea-dability caused by unusually many ldraganas0 we may neeA a qua?dratic formula on hiragana rim length or hiragana run frequencies.References/Recker 1984/Becker, R.
