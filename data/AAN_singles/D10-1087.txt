The method can be used as an ele-mental technology for natural language gen-eration such as speech recognition and ma-chine translation, or in writing-support toolsfor non-native speakers.
We categorized theusages of commas and investigated the ap-pearance tendency of each category.
In thismethod, the positions where commas shouldbe inserted are decided based on a machinelearning approach.
We conducted a commainsertion experiment using a text corpus andconfirmed the effectiveness of our method.1 IntroductionIn Japanese sentences, commas are inserted to markword boundaries that might be otherwise unclear be-cause Japanese is a non-segmented language.
Theyare also inserted at sharp semantic boundaries to im-prove the readability of a sentence.
While there is atendency about the positions where commas shouldbe inserted in a Japanese sentence, there is no clearstandard for these positions.
Therefore, it is hardfor non-natives of Japanese such as foreign studentsto insert commas properly, and the method for au-tomatic comma insertion is required to support sen-tence generation by such people.
In addition, thismethod is expected to be useful for improving read-ability of texts generated by automatic speech recog-nition or machine translation.This paper proposes a method for automaticallyinserting commas into Japanese texts.
There areseveral usages of commas, and the positions to in-sert commas depend on these usages.
Therefore,we grouped the usages of commas into nine cate-gories, and investigated the appearance tendency foreach category to find the effective features of ma-chine learning by using Japanese newspaper arti-cles.
Based on the analysis of comma positions, ourmethod decides whether or not to insert a commaat each bunsetsu1 boundary in an input sentence bymachine learning.We conducted an experiment on comma insertionusing the Kyoto Text Corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao,1998), and obtained higher recall and precision thanthose of the baseline, leading us to confirm the ef-fectiveness of our method.This paper is organized as follows: The next sec-tion presents related works.
Section 3 gives prelim-inary analyses.
Section 4 explains how our commainsertion method works.
An experiment and discus-sions are presented in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.2 Related WorksThere have been many investigations on comma in-sertion into output texts of speech recognition sys-tems to improve the readability (Christensen et al,2001; Kim and Woodland, 2001; Liu et al, 2006;Shimizu et al, 2008).
Their methods insert commasusing pause information of speakers, based on theidea that a point at which a speaker takes a breathpartly corresponds to a point where a comma is in-serted.
However, since pause information cannot beobtained from texts, we cannot use this approach be-cause our targets are written texts.In addition, there have been some investigations1Bunsetsu is a linguistic unit in Japanese that roughly corre-sponds to a basic phrase in English.
A bunsetsu consists of oneindependent word and zero or more ancillary words.892on comma insertion into non-Japanese written texts(White and Rajkumar, 2008; Guo et al, 2010).
InJapanese, there are several usages of commas, andsome usages are specific to Japanese due to its lin-guistic nature.
Therefore, just adopting the abovementioned methods, which have been developedto process non-Japanese texts, is not sufficient toenable high-quality comma insertion into Japanesesentences.
Development of a method based on thedetailed analysis of Japanese commas is required.Furthermore, there have been some investiga-tions on comma insertion into Japanese written texts(Hayashi, 1992; Suzuki et al, 1995).
These investi-gations have adopted rule-based methods.
However,the number of their rules is not necessarily sufficient,and no quantitative evaluation has been performed.3 Analyses on Comma UsagesThere have been several discussions on commas,including the draft of ?Kutou-hou (punctuation)?made by Archives Division, Minister?s Secretariat,Japanese Ministry of Education, Science and Cul-ture in 1906.
There are several usages of commas,and depending on the usage, the types of positionswhere commas are inserted are different.
First, weexamined some previous publications on commas(Honda, 1982; Inukai, 2002; Shogakukan?s editior-ial department, 2007).
Based on the results of the ex-amination, we classified the usages of commas intonine categories shown in Table 1.
Here, commasin Japanese sentences and commas in English sen-tences have some common roles.
In Japanese sen-tences, some commas have the same roles as com-mas in English sentences, but some commas haveroles specific to Japanese due to its linguistic naturesuch as ?Japanese is a non-segmented language?
or?Japanese has kanji characters and katakana charac-ters.
?In our study, positions where a comma shouldbe inserted are detected by using machine learning.We investigated the Kyoto Text Corpus version 4.0(Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998) to find the effectivefeatures.
The Kyoto Text Corpus is a collection ofJapanese articles of Mainichi newspaper.
We usedthe articles on January 1st and from January 3rd to11th in 1995 as the analysis data.
Table 2 showsthe size of the data.
The data had been manuallyTable 1: Categorization of usages of commas# usage of comma1 commas between clauses2 commas indicating clear dependency relations3 commas for avoiding reading mistakes andreading difficulty4 commas indicating the subject5 commas inserted after a conjunction oradverb at the beginning of a sentence6 commas inserted between parallel words orphrases7 commas inserted after an adverbial phrase toindicate time8 commas emphasizing the adjacent word9 otherTable 2: Size of the analysis datasentences 11,821bunsetsus 117,501characters 503,970commas 16,595characters per sentence 42.63annotated with information on morphological anal-ysis, bunsetsu segmentation and dependency2 anal-ysis.
Clause boundaries were detected by the clauseboundary detection program CBAP (Kashioka andMaruyama, 2004).Out of all the inserted commas, only 1.43%were inserted at positions which were not bunsetsuboundaries.
Therefore, we analyzed only commasinserted at bunsetsu boundaries.
Of 105,680 bun-setsu boundaries, commas were inserted at 16,357bunsetsu boundaries, that is, the rate of commainsertion was 15.48%.
In the following sections,we focus on morphemes, clause boundaries, depen-dency relation and the number of characters betweencommas, and investigate their relations with com-mas.3.1 Commas between ClausesIf a sentence consists of several clauses, insertinga comma between clauses makes clear the sentence2A dependency in a Japanese sentence is a modification re-lation in which a modifier bunsetsu depends on a modified bun-setsu.
That is, the modifier bunsetsu and the modified bunsetsuwork as a modifier and a modifyee, respectively.893Table 3: Rates of comma insertion according to the clauseboundary typetype of clause boundary ratio of commainsertion (%)topicalized element-wa 16.94 (1,446/8,536)adnominal clause 0.72 (43/5,960)continuous clause 84.57 (2,685/3,175)compound clause-te 23.31 (394/1,690)quotational clause 4.40 (74/1,680)supplement clause 17.53 (245/1,398)discourse marker 60.13 (650/1,081)compound clause-ga 93.85 (946/1,008)compound clause-de 84.52 (606/717)condition clause-to 81.66 (423/518)structure.
Therefore, a clause boundary is consid-ered to be a strong candidate of a position where acomma is inserted.
For example, in the followingsentence3:?
???????????????????????????????????????????
(Toward lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq byUnited Nations, the aim seems to be to request fur-ther cooperation from France, which has close tiesto Iraq.
)a comma is inserted at the clause boundary right af-ter the continuous clause ??????????????
(Toward lifting the sanctions imposedon Iraq by United Nations).?
Like this example, thesame usage of commas is seen in English as well.In the analysis data, there existed 29,278 clauseboundaries excluding sentence breaks.
Amongthem, commas were inserted at 8,805 positions(30.01%).
The rate is higher than that of bunsetsuboundaries.
This indicates that commas tend to beinserted at clause boundaries.We investigated the rate of comma insertion about114 types4 of clause boundaries.
Table 3 shows thetop 10 clause boundary types according to the oc-currence frequency, and the rates of comma inser-3We underlined commas which we mentioned in the exam-ple and the corresponding positions in the translation of the ex-ample.4In our research, we used the types of clause boundaries de-fined by the Clause Boundary Annotation Program (Kashiokaand Maruyama, 2004).!"#$%&'()*+,-./.012345678#9:;1<=>?@ABC6*DE>1FG+HIJKLMBC6N!"#$%&'()*+',+$-.,/0.&$($,.#1.2$/3$1+.$42/*1+$/3$1+.$*/256)$1+.$&12/#4$72.&.#,.$/3$8+'#($#/1$/#59$-2'#4&$+/7.$-:1$(5&/$,(:&.&$6'33',:51$72/-5.0&;<!!

In cases of ?continuous clause?
and ?com-pound clause-de,?
the rates were higher than 84%.On the other hand, in cases of ?adnominal clause?and ?quotational clause,?
the rates were lower than5%.
This means that the likelihoods of comma inser-tion are different according to the clause boundarytype.3.2 Commas and Dependency StructureCommas have a role to make dependency relationsclearer.
Commas tend to be inserted right after abunsetsu that depends on a distant bunsetsu.
In Fig-ure 1, although the bunsetsu ??
?
(in Asia)?depends on the bunsetsu ??
?
?
(causes),?if the comma right after the bunsetsu ?????
(inAsia)?
is not inserted, the readers might mistakenlyunderstand that the bunsetsu ?????
(in Asia)?depends on the next bunsetsu ??????
(strong).
?To avoid the mistake, the comma is inserted.In the analysis data, there existed 66,984 bunset-sus which depend on the next bunsetsu.
Among thebunsetsu boundaries right after them, 2,302 (3.44%)were the positions where a comma was inserted.
Onthe other hand, in the case of a bunsetsu bound-ary right after a bunsetsu which does not depend onthe next bunsetsu, the rate of comma insertion was36.32% (14,055/38,696).In addition, when the modifyee of a bunsetsu islocated outside the clause containing the bunsetsu,i.e.
to the right of the clause end, commas are con-sidered to be more frequently inserted right after thebunsetsu because such bunsetsu causes more com-plex dependency structure.
The rate of comma in-sertion right after such bunsetsu is 54.24%.8943.3 Commas for Avoiding Reading Mistakesand Reading DifficultyAlthough, unlike English, Japanese is a non-segmented language, word boundaries are easy todetect because Japanese has three types of charac-ters; hiragana characters, katakana characters, andkanji characters.
However, if the same types of char-acters appear sequentially, readers may make a read-ing mistake or feel difficulty in reading them.
Toavoid such mistakes and difficulty, there is a usageof commas specific to Japanese.In the following example, a comma is insertedbetween two sequentially appearing words ??(burned)?
and ??
(ashes)?
both of which consist ofonly kanji characters.?
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????
(He seemed to acknowledgethat he had carried the corpse of Mr. Kawasaki to anacquaintance in Hanasaki, Katashina-mura, Tone-gun, Gunma Prefecture, burned it and abandonedits ashes in the mountain forest in Katashina-mura.
)The comma was inserted because if there was nocomma, the word boundary would become unclearand reading difficulty would be caused.
Among2,409 bunsetsu boundaries over which kanji charac-ters appeared sequentially, commas were inserted at2,188 (90.83%) bunsetsu boundaries.
In the case ofkatakana characters, the rate was 97.69% (211/216).Commas tend to be inserted at most bunsetsu bound-aries if kanji characters or katakana characters se-quentially appear over a boundary.3.4 Commas Indicating the SubjectCommas are considered to be inserted right after abunsetsu that represents the subject of a sentence.For example, in Figure 2, a comma is inserted rightafter the bunsetsu ???
(war)?
to indicate that thebunsetsu is the subject of the sentence.
Here, we payattention to the clause boundary of the type ?topi-calized element-wa.?
The rate that commas were in-serted at the clause boundaries ?topicalized element-wa?
was 16.94% (1,446/8,536).
This rate is almostthe same as that of bunsetsu boundaries.
On theother hand, the commas inserted at the clause bound-aries ?topicalized element-wa?
accounted for 8.84%(1,446/16,357) of all the inserted commas.!"#$%&'()*+,-./"01234567-809:;<34=>?@ABC!

right after a bunsetsu which does notdepend on the next bunsetsu (e.g., the bunsetsu ???
(war)?
in Figure 2), the rate of comma inser-tion was 20.71% (1,426/6,886).
The rate is higherthan that of all the clause boundaries ?topicalizedelement-wa.?
This shows that commas tend to beespecially inserted at the ?topicalized element-wa?right after bunsetsus which do not depend on thenext bunsetsu.3.5 Commas after Conjunction or AdverbCommas tend to be inserted right after a conjunc-tion or an adverb located at the beginning of a sen-tence.
These commas correspond to English com-mas which are inserted right after a word such as?however?
and ?furthermore?
located at the begin-ning of a sentence.?
??????????????????????
(However, I do not feel like agreeing on it.
)In the analysis data, there existed 695 bunset-sus whose rightmost morpheme is a conjunctionand which are located at the beginning of a sen-tence.
Among them, commas were inserted rightafter 498 (71.65%) bunsetsus.
In the case of bun-setsus whose rightmost morpheme is an adverb, therate was 30.97% (140/452).3.6 Commas Inserted between Parallel Wordsor PhrasesCommas have a function which makes clear sepa-ration between parallel words or phrases.
The fol-lowing example shows commas separating parallelnouns.895?
??????????????????????????????????????????
(TheUnited Nations should play a lot of roles in a broadrange of fields, such as the global environment,population, and food.
)In this example, commas are inserted to separateparallel nouns ?
?
(environment),?
??
(popula-tion)?
and ?
?
(food)?.
In English, there are com-mas which perform the same role.
In fact, commaswere inserted between ?environment?
and ?popula-tion?
and between ?population?
and ?food?
in thetranslation of the above example.
When bunsetsuswhose rightmost morpheme is a noun appear se-quentially, the rate of comma insertion between suchbunsetsus is 59.39% (3,330/5,607).Also, commas are inserted to separate parallelphrases.
In the following example,?
????????????????????????????????????????????????????
(The menu is decided by avoid-ing the menu the Prime Minister ate on the previousnight, and by considering the balance between theJapanese food and the European food.
)a comma is inserted right after the bunsetsu ????
(avoiding)?
to make clear separation between theparallel phrases ??????????
(by avoid-ing the menu)?
and ????????????????
(by considering the balance between theJapanese food and the European food).?
The rateof comma insertion between two parallel phrases is79.89% (751/940).
This is much higher than that ofbunsetsu boundaries, indicating that commas tend tobe inserted when phrases are paralleled.3.7 Number of Characters between CommasIf there are too many commas at a short distance,the sentence becomes hard to read.
Therefore, thenumber of characters between commas is expectedto be not too small.
Also, because a long sequenceof characters without a comma is generated if thedistance between commas is very long, the occur-rence frequency of such sequences of characters isconsidered to be low.We investigated the number of characters betweencommas and its occurrence frequency.

"#$%&'()'*+,&,*-%&.Figure 3: Number of characters between commas and itsoccurrence frequencyshows the results of investigation.
When the num-ber of characters between commas is either large orsmall, the occurrence frequency is low.4 Comma Insertion MethodIn our method, a sentence, on which morphologi-cal analysis, bunsetsu segmentation, clause bound-ary analysis and dependency analysis have been per-formed, is considered the input.
Our method de-cides whether or not to insert a comma at each bun-setsu boundary in an input sentence.
Based on theanalysis results in Section 3, our method adopts thebunsetsu boundaries as candidate positions where acomma is inserted.
Our method identifies the mostappropriate combination among all combinations ofpositions where a comma can be inserted, by usingthe probabilistic model.

We used the articles fromJanuary 14th to 17th as the test data.
The trainingdata is same as the analysis data.
Table 5 shows thesize of the test data.
Here, we used the maximumentropy method tool (Le, 2008) with the default op-tions except ?-i 2000.?In the evaluation, we obtained the recall, the pre-cision and their harmonic mean, i.e., F-measure.The recall and precision are respectively defined asfollows.recall=# of correctly inserted commas# of commas in the correct dataprecision=# of correctly inserted commas# of inserted commasIn our research, to realize automatic comma in-sertion with high quality, we analyzed each usage ofcommas and decided the features for the ME methodbased on the analysis.
To confirm the effectivenessof our features, we established the baseline methodas a comparative method whereby commas are in-serted by the ME method in which only simple mor-phological information is used.
The baseline methoduses the morphological information in Table 4 andthe information of the rightmost morpheme (a sur-face form) of a bunsetsu as features.5.2 Experimental ResultsTable 6 shows the experimental results of the base-line and our method.
The recall and precisionwere 69.13% and 84.13% respectively, and we con-firmed that our method had higher performance thanTable 5: Size of test datasentences 4,659bunsetsus 46,511characters 198,899commas 6,549characters per sentence 42.69Table 6: Experimental resultsrecall precision F-measureour 69.13% 84.13% 75.90method (4,527/6,549) (4,527/5,381)baseline 51.38% 70.90% 59.58(3,365/6,549) (3,365/4,746)the baseline method.

On the other hand, our method was ableto insert commas properly at such bunsetsu bound-aries.6 Discussion6.1 Error AnalysisAmong positions where commas existed in the testdata, there existed 2,022 positions where our methoddid not insert commas.
Among them, 862 wereclause boundaries, and the clause boundary ?topical-ized element-wa?
accounted for 53.36% (460/862)of them.
There were a lot of clause boundaries ofthe type ?topicalized element-wa,?
and the numberof commas inserted at such boundaries was large.But, the rate of comma insertion itself was not veryhigh.
We can say that the four features about ?topi-calized element-wa?
did not always work well.

(Put pork backfat garlic, ginger and shredded greenonion in a bowl, and add red bell peppers for color.
)In the correct data, a comma was inserted betweenthe bunsetsu ??
(backfat)?
and ?????
(gar-lic).
?If a comma should be inserted right after the bun-setsu ??
?
(backfat),?
the number of characters be-tween commas would become too small to be judgedas appropriate by the proposed method.
So, the fea-ture about the number of characters between com-mas may have had harmful effects there.
On theother hand, a comma was inserted properly betweenthe bunsetsu ?????
(garlic)?
and ?
???(ginger).?
This is because katakana characters ap-peared sequentially in addition to appearing as par-allel nouns.6.2 Unnatural Comma InsertionWhen commas are inserted at obviously unnaturalpositions, they have a major impact on the under-standing of a sentence by readers.
Here, we inves-tigated how many commas had been inserted at ob-viously unnatural positions by our method.
For thearticle on January 14th (217 sentences, 2,349 bun-setsus) in the test data, we examined 47 commas in-serted incorrectly.
Three persons decided whetheror not the inserted commas were obviously unnat-ural through consultations.
Concretely, when all ofthe three persons felt that an inserted comma wouldmake readers understand wrongly the meaning ofthe sentence, the comma was judged to be obviouslyunnatural.Among 47 commas, 4 commas were judged obvi-ously unnatural.
This result shows that our methodis capable of inserting commas at natural positionson some level.899Table 8: Comparison with human judgementrecall precision F-measureby human 78.30% 80.58% 79.42(249/318) (249/309)our method 71.07% 82.78% 76.48(226/318) (226/273)6.3 Comparison with Human JudgementIn our experiment, we evaluated the results ofcomma insertion of our method by comparing themwith the correct data.
However, the sufficient levelto be reached by automatic comma insertion is un-certain.
Here, we evaluated our method by com-paring them with the results of comma insertion byanother person.
By using the same data as used inthe subsection 6.2, we conducted an experiment oncomma insertion by an annotator who was familiarwith writing Japanese documents.
Table 8 shows therecall, the precision and the F-measure.
The secondrow shows the results of our method for the samedata.
As the F-measure of the annotator was 79.42,it turned out that comma insertion task was diffi-cult even for humans.
For F-measure, our methodachieved 96.30% (76.48/79.42) of the annotator?s re-sult.
Also, the precision of our method was 82.78%.Although the comma insertion task is difficult, ourmethod was able to properly insert commas.7 ConclusionThis paper proposed a method for inserting commasinto Japanese texts.
Our method appropriately in-serts commas based on the machine learning methodusing such features as morphemes, dependenciesand clause boundaries.
An experiment by using theKyoto Text Corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998)showed an F-measure of 75.90, and we confirmedthe effectiveness of our method.The analysis of the experimental results showedthat our method cannot insert commas of the par-ticular usage.
As a future work, it is necessary tofind more useful features for commas of this usageand improve the recall of our method.
Also, we willexamine ?commas emphasizing the adjacent word?which were not included in our targets.AcknowledgmentsThis research was partially supported by the Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research (B) (No.
