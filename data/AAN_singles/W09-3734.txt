My proposalis based on the Japanese genitive postposition no.
The Japanese ?NP1-noNP2?
construction expresses a wider range of relations between two entitiesthan does the English possessive ?NP1?s NP2,?
such that the Pustejovskianqualia roles encoded in NP2do not supply the necessary relations betweentwo entities, which [7] succeeded to certain degree.
Possessive relation dis-ambiguation requires enriching lexical entries by incorporating the HAVErelation into the CONSTITUTIVE role and listing other qualia such as theACTIVITY and the SPATIO-TEMPORAL role with the subcategories ofLOCATION and TIME.2 Various Relations and Argument ReversalThe Japanese genitive marker is semantically very ambiguous.
?NP1-GENNP2?
expresses not only possession as in John?s pen and a part-whole relationas in John?s leg, but also location, accompaniment, property, quantity, etc.,as shown in Table 1.Relation Japanese English English EnglishPossessive Possessive Compound PPI possession Tanaka-no kaban Tanaka?s bag *Tanaka bag a bag of TanakaII part-whole Tanaka-no kao Tanaka?s face *Tanaka face the face of TanakaIII location Tokyo-no *Tokyo?s Tokyo relativesshinseki relative relatives in TokyoIV time 3-ji-no koen *3 o?clock?s park *3 o?clock park park at 3 o?clock310V kaban-no hito *bag?s man the bag man the manaccompaniment with a bagboshi-no fujin *hat?s lady hat lady the lady with a hatVI trade Kaban-no Sanpei *bags?

On the contrary in (V), the possessor ofthe bag is NP2hito ?man?
and there is no English equivalent big bag?sperson.
In (VI) Kaban-no Sanpei ?Bags Sanpei,?
Sanpei is a bag store,and therefore the possessor of a bag.
The controller-controllee relation isalso reversed, for example, in Tanaka-no kuruma ?Tanaka?s car?
(type I),Tanaka is the controller of the car, i.e., NP2the car is at Tanaka?s disposalas in English the girl?s car [7].
On the contrary, in boshi-no fujin ?thelady with a hat,?
NP1boshi is at the person?s disposal.
Aoi-me-no ningyo?the doll with blue eyes,?
literally, ?blue eyes?
doll?
in (VIII) even expressesthe part-whole relation in the reverse direction, compared with ningyo-nome ?the doll?s eyes.?
Such non-canonical relations, i.e., other than thoseexpressing possession or a part-whole relation, are more likely expressed innoun compounds such as magic land or prepositional phrases using of, in,or with in English.3 Problems with Deriving Various Possessive Re-lations from NP2Possessive relations are ambiguous in both English and Japanese.
For ex-ample, there is more than one interpretation for Tanaka-no hon ?Tanaka?sbook.?
Tanaka?s book may refer to the book that Tanaka owns or the book311that Tanaka wrote [1,87].
In view of such ambiguity, [4] assumes two syn-tactic types for John?s depending on whether or not the following noun isinherently relational.
If the following noun is a non-relational common noun(CN) such as car, John?s composes with car which is regular (et) type, andthe relation between John and car is contextually supplied (1a).
On the con-trary, when John is followed by inherently relational nouns such as brother,employee and enemy, which are (e,et) type with an extra argument slot,the relation between John and his brother in John?s brother inherits kinshipfrom the two-place predicate brother (1b).
(2) exemplifies the computationrelated to another relational noun, friend.

= ?P [John?s(?z.?x[?y[friend?

(z)(y) ?
y = x] ?
P (x)]]If we apply Partee?s theory to Japanese examples, most of the possessiverelations are unpredictable, and the contextually supplied relation R remainslargely ambiguous.
Possession relation (I) is prototypical, and part-whole re-lation (II) can be derived lexically from a possessive te ?hand?
[1].
However,other possessee nominals are not necessarily relational.
In order to reducethe cost of pragmatics, [7] apply the Qualia Structure [5] of the possesseenoun and type-shift even non-inherently relational NP2into a relationalnoun.
For example, even though poem is not a relational noun, John?s poemcan be interpreted as the poem that John composed because the internalsemantic structure of poem contains an author-of relation as AGENTIVErole.
The meaning shifting operator QAraises a one-place holder poem in(3a) into a two-place holder in (3b).
The type-shifted NP2can now combinewith the possessive NP, which has a uniformly type ((e,et),(et,t)) so thatthe authorship relation is inherited from NP2poem, and R is no longer afree variable.312(3) QA(poem) = ?x?y[poem?
(x) ?
compose?
(x)(y)]However, even [7]?s method is not sufficient to systematically computethe meaning of the Japanese ?NP1-no NP2?
construction.
For example, interms of location (III), tomodachi ?friend?
and shinseki ?relative?
in Tokyo-no tomodachi ?a friend in Tokyo?
and Kyoto-no shinseki ?Kyoto relative?are relational nouns, i.e., friend-of x/relative-of x, but the relation betweenNP1and NP2is not friend-of or relative of but of location, namely, NP2isin NP1.
We also encounter a problem with boshi-no fujin ?the lady with ahat.?
Since wearing a hat is not part of the qualia roles, that are AGENTIVE(origin), TELIC (purpose), CONSTITUTIVE (part-whole) and FORMAL(isa) roles, of the non-inherently relational noun fujin?lady,?
even Viknerand Jensen?s system is unable to supply the binder for R.4 Enriching the Qualia StructureIn order to reduce the weight of pragmatics, I propose encoding more in-formation into the lexicon elaborating the qualia structure.
Specifically, Isuggest adding two qualia into the already existing four qualia roles:- CONSTITUTIVE = SIZE, WEIGHT, HAVE, COLOR- TELIC = TRADE- SPATIO-TEMPO = IN, AT- ACTIVITY = MAKE ACT, DRINK ACTHAVE, which is a two-place predicate with possessor and possessee ar-guments, is added to subcategories of the extended CONST quole.
LO-CATION and TIME are subcategories of the new SPATIO-TEMPO role.These are added to the qualia roles of nominals because all physical objectsusually occupy some space and time [6].
In addition to WEIGHT, whichis included into the CONST quale in [5], we add SIZE, which is related todimensionality, and COLOR.
TRADE is incorporated into the TELIC role.SIZE and COLOR are part of the CONST role of clothing artifacts suchas boshi ?hat?
; therefore, aka-no boshi ?the red hat?
can be computed com-positionally.
The TIME, the LOCATION and the HAVE roles of locationterms such as koen ?park?
are used to interpret haru-no koen meaning ?thepark in spring,?
chicaku-no koen meaning ?a nearby park,?
and tsutsuji-no koen meaning ?a park with azaleas,?
respectively.
TRADE role in theTELIC of proper nouns is observed in Supa-no Maruetsu ?Maruetsu Su-permarket?
and Kaban-no Sanpei ?Sanpei for bags.?
Such expanded qualiaroles can substitute R through type-shifting NP2.313The ?
operator and the ?
operator lower the types of CN into (e).
Theuse of the ?
operator follows its use for Japanese nouns in [2].

We need to enrich the lexicalinput by expanding the subcategories of FORMAL and CONSTITUTIVEroles, and by supplementing them with new roles ?
SPATIO-TEMPO andACTIVITY.
As [7] did not propose any method for restricting the quale to beused for type-shifting, the present analysis does not provide any suggestionsfor identifying the quale to be used for the interpretation of the possessivenoun phrases.
However, it provides the enriched lexical entry which enablesaccess to the sense of NP2and determines the semantic relation expressedby Japanese genitive postpositions.References[1] Chris Barker.
