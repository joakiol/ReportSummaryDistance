Theprocess of bilingual text matching consists of two ma-jor steps: sentence alignment and structural matchingof bilingual sentences.
Statistical techniques are aptplied to estimate word correspondences not includedin bilingual dictionaries.
Estimated word correspon-dences are useful for improving both sentence align-ment and structural matching.1 In t roduct ionBilingnal (or parallel) texts are useful as resources oflinguistic knowledge as well as in applications uch asmachine translation.One of the major approaches to analyzing bilin-gual texts is the statistical approach.
The statisticalapproach involves the following: alignment of bilin-gual texts at the sentence level nsing statistical tech-niques (e.g.
Brown, Lai and Mercer (1991), Gale andChurch (1993), Chen (1993), and Kay and RSscheisen(1993)), statistical machine translation models (e.g.Brown, Cooke, Pietra, Pietra et al (1990)), findingcharacter-level / word-level / phrase-level correspon-dences from bilingual texts (e.g.
Gale and Church(1991), Church (1993), and Kupiec (1993)), and wordsense disambiguation for MT (e.g.
Dagan, Itai andSchwall (1991)).
In general, the statistical approachdoes not use existing hand-written bilingual dictio-naries, and depends solely upon statistics.
For ex-ample, sentence alignment of bilingual texts are per-formed just by measuring sentence lengths in wordsor in characters (Brown et al, 1991; Gale and Church,1993), or by statistically estimating word level corre-spondences (Chen, 1993; Kay and RSscheisen, 1993).The statistical approach analyzes unstructured sen-tences in bilingual texts, and it is claimed that theresults are useful enough in real applications uch asmachine translation and word sense disambiguation.However, structured bilingual sentences are undoubt-edly more informative and important for future natu-ral language researches.
Structured bilingual or mul-tilingual corpora serve as richer sonrces for extract-ing linguistic knowledge (Klavans and Tzonkermann,1990; Sadler and Vendelmans, 1990; Kaji, Kida attdMorimoto, 1992; Utsuro, Matsnmoto and Nagao,1992; Matsumoto, l.shimoto and Utsuro, 1993; Ut-suro, Matsumoto and Nagao, 1993).
Compared withthe statistical approach, those works are quite differ-ent in that they use word correspondence informationavailable in hand-written bilingual dictionaries andtry to extract structured linguistic knowledge suchas structured translation patterns and case frames ofverbs.
For example, in Matsunloto et al (1993), weproposed a method for finding structural matchingof parallel sentences, making use of word level simi-larities calculated from a bilingual dictionary and athesaurus.
Then, those structurally matched parallelsentences are used as a source for acquiring lexicalknowledge snch as verbal case frames (Utsuro et al,1992; Utsuro et al, 1993).With the aim of acquiring those structnred linguis-tic knowledge, this paper describes a unilied frame-work for bilingual text matching by combining exist-ing hand-written bilingual dictionaries and statisticaltechniques.
The process of bilingual text matchin 9consists of two major steps: sentence alignment andstructural matching of bilingual sentences.
In thosetwo steps, we use word correspondence information,which is available in hand-written bilingual dictionar-ies, or not included in bilingual dictionaries but esti-mated with statistical techniques.The reasons why we take the approach of combin-ing bilingual dictionaries and statistics are as follows:Statistical techniques are limited since 1) they re-quire bilingnal texts to be long enough for extract-ing usefifl statistics, while we need to acquire struc-tured liugnistic knowledge ven from bilingual textsof about 100 sentences, 2) even with bilingual textslong enough for statistical techniques, useful statisticscan not be extracted for low frequency words.
For thereasons 1) and 2), the use of bilingual dictionaries isinevitable in our application.
On the other hand, ex-isting hand-written bilingual dictionaries are limitedin that available dictionaries are only for daily wm'dsand usually domain specific on-line bilingual dictio-naries are not available.
Thus, statistical techniquesare also inevitable for extracting domain specific wordcorrespondence information uot included in existingbilingual dictionarie'~.At present, we are at tile starting point of com-bining existing bilingual dictionaries and statisticaltechniques.
'\['herefore, asstatistical techniques tbr es-timating word correspondences not included in bilin-gual dictionaries, we decided to adopt techniques a.ssimple as possible, rather than techniques based-oncomplex probabilistic translation models such as in1076s ta t i s t i ca l  = =UJaPanese .

What we adopt are sim-ple co-occurrence-frequency-based techlfiques in Galeand Churcl, (1991) aaM Kay and lfiSscheisen (1993).As techniques for sentence ;flignment, we.
adopt alsoquite a simple method based-.on the number of wordcorrespondence.% without ~tny probabilistic transla-tion models.in the following sections, we illustrate the specifi-cations of our bilingual text nlatehing fl'alnework.2 The Framework of Bi l ingualText MatchingThe overall framework of bilingual text inatching isdepicted in l:ig.
1.
Although our framework is in>plemented for Japanese and l~;nglish, it is bmguageil,dependent.First, bilingual texts are aligned at sentence levelusing word correspondence inforin~tiol, which is avail-able in bilingual dictionaries or estimated by statis.tic~l techniques.
"Statistical estim~ttioa" t text; levelindicates that lengtl>based statistical techniques arcapplied if necessary.
(At present, they are not im-plemented.)
"Stati,stical c.stimation" ~tt sentence levelindicates that word-to.-word correspondences ~re e>timated by statistic~d techniques.
Then, eueh 1110110lingual sentence is parsed into a disjunctive depen-dency structure ~Hld structurally matched using wordcorrespondence information.
In the course of struc.tural matching, lexical and synt~Lctic tunbiguities ofmonolinguM sentences are resolved.
FinMly, from thematching results, monolinguM lexical knowledge andtranslation patterns m'e acquired.So fitr, we have implemented the following,: sen-tence ~dignment btLsed-on word correspondence in-formation, word correspondence estimation by co-occnl'rence-ffequency-based methods in GMe midChurch (19.~H) and Kay and R6scheisen (1993), struc-tured Imttehlng of parallel sentences (Matsumoto eta l., 1993), and case Dame acquisition of Japaneseverbs (Utsuro et al, 1993).
In the remainder ofthis paper, we describe the specifications of sentencealiglmlent: and word correspondence estimation insections 3 and 4, then report the results of small ex-periments and evMuate our framework in section 5.I0773 Sentence  A l ignment3.1  B i l ingua l  Sentence  A l ignmentP rob lemIll this section, we formally define the problem ofbilingual sentence Mignment)Let S be a text of n sentences of a language, andT be a text of m sentences of another language andsuppose that S and T are translation of each other:--__ S l ,S2~.

In this paper, wecall the pair of minimM corresponding segments inbilingual texts a sentence bead.
2 Then, sentences inbilingual texts of S and T are aligned into a sequenceP of sentence beads:P = P l ,P~, .

We assume that each sentence belongs toonly one sentence bead and order constraints mustbe preserved in sentence alignment.
Supposing Pi =(ai, xi;  bi, Yi),  those constraints are expressed in thefollowing:a0 = 0 , b0 = 0ai = ai 1 + .~ci , bi = bi-1 q- yl (1 < i _< k)Suppose that  a scoring function h can be definedfor estimating the validity of each sentence bead pi.Then, bilingual sentence alignment problem can bedefined as an optimization problem that finds a se-quence P of sentence beads which optimizes the totalscore H of the sequence P:H(P)  = I Ih (h (p l )  .

3l In this paper, we do not describe paragraph alignment pro-cess.
For the moment, our paragraph alignment program is notreliable enough and the results of sentence alignment are betterwithout paragraph alignment tban with paragraph alignment.Since bilingual texts in our bilingual corpus are not so long,the computational  cost of sentence Mignment is not seriousproblem even without paragraph Mignment.2The term bead is taken from Brown et al (1991).3We basically use dictionary-based bilingual sentence align-ment method originMly reported in Murao (1991).
The workin Murao (1991) was done under the supervision of Prof. M.Nagao and Prof. S. Sato (JAIST, East).3.2.1 Score of Sentence  BeadBefore aligning sentences in bilingual texts, contentwords are extracted frmn each sentence (after eachsentence is morphologicMly analyzed if necessary),and word correspondences are found using both bilin-gum dictionaries and statistical information source forword correspondence.
Then, using those word corre-spondence information, the score h of a sentence beadp is calculated as follows.First, supposing p= (a, x; b, y), and let n~(a, x) andnt (b ,y )  be the numbers of content words in the se-quences of sentences ~4, .
.
.
, s ,  and t~v~,,...,tbrespectively, and n~t(p) be the nunlber of correspond-ing word pairs in p. Then, the score h ofp is defined asthe ratio of n~t(p) to the sum of n~(a,x) and nt (b ,y ) :t,,(p) ~,(p)3.2.2 Dynamic  P rogramming MethodLet Pi be the sequence of sentence beads fi'om thebegbming of the bilingual text up to the bead pi:Pi = pa ,p2 , .
.
.
,p iThen, we assume that the score H(P i )  of Pi followsthe recursion equation below:H(P i )  = l l (P i - l )  + h(pl)  (1)Let Hm(a i ,  bl) be the maximum score of aligning apart of S (from the beginning up to the a i (=a i_ l+x i )  -th sentence) and a part of T (f,'om the beginning upto b i (=b i - l+y i )  - th sentence).
Then, Equation I istransformed into://.~(a~, b~)where the initial condition is:Um(ao,6o) = H.,(o,o) = oWe limit the pair (x i ,Y i )  of the numbers of sen-tences in a sentence bead to some probable ones.
Forthe remnant, we allow only 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-2 aspMrs of the numbers of sentences:(x i ,y i )  e {(1,1) , (1,2) , (2,1) , (1,3) ,(3, 1), (1,4), (4, 1), (2, 2)}This optimization problem is solvable as a standardproblem in dynamic programming.
Dynamic pro-gramming is applied to bilingual sentence alignmentin most of previous works (Brown et al, 1991; Gateand Church, 1993; Chen, 1993).10784 Word  Cor respondence  Esti-mat ionIn this section, first we describe stimation flmctionsbased-on co-occnrrence frequencies.
Then, we showhow to incorporate word correspondence informationavailable in bilingual dictionaries and to estimateword correspondences not included in bilingual dic-tionaries.
Finally, we describe the threshold fnnctionfor extracting corresponding word pairs.4.1  Es t imat ion  Funct ionin the following, we assume that sentences in thebilingual text are already aligned.Let w, and w~ be words in the texts S and T re-spectively, we define the following frequencies:freq(w~,,wt) = (frequency of wa and wt'sco-occurring in a sentence head)f', 'eq(w,) = (frequency of 'w.~)f req(wt)  = (frequency of wt)N - (total number of sentence beads)Then, estimation functions of Gale's (Gale andChurch, 1991 ) and Kay's (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993)are given a.s below.4.1.1 Gale 's  MethodLet a ,-~ d be as follows:b := freq(w~) ~ f req(w~,wt)c - freq(*vt)--  freq(w~,w~)d = N-a -b - -eThen, the validity of word correspondence w, and wtis estimated by the following value:(an - be) 2( .
+ 6)(~ ~ e)(b + a)(e + d)( .~ b.  )
"~f req(w~) f req(wt ) (N  - f req(w, , ) ) (N -  f req(wt) )4.1.2 Kay 's  MethodThe validity of word correspondence w~ and wt isestimated by the following value:2freq(w~, wt) hk(',.~, '.~) - :~eq(w.) + f~eq(~.,)4.2  Incorporat ing  B i l ingua l  D ic t io -naryBy incorporating word correspondence informationavailable in bilingual dictionaries, it becomes easier toestimate word correspondences not included in bilin-gum dictionaries.Let w, be a word in the text S and wt,w~ be wordsin the text T. Suppose that the correspondence of w,and wt is included in bilingual dictionaries, while thecorrespondence of w, and w~ is not included.
Thenthe problem is to estimate the validity of word corre-spondence of w,~ and 'w' t.Let f req(w~,wt) ,  freq(w~,w~), freq(w~),f req(wt) ,  and freq(w~) be the same as above, andf rcq(ws,  wt, w't)be the frequency of w,, we, and w't'sco-occurring in a sentence bead.
Then, we solve theproblem above by defining f req ' (w, ,w~),  fveq' (w,) ,freq'(w't) , and N' which becmne the inputs to Gale'smethod or Kay's method.
We describe two differentways of defining those vMues.Est imat ion  IOne is to estimate all the word correspondencesequally except hat the co-occurrence of wa and wtis preferred to that of ,w~ and w~.
freq'(w~,w'~),fveq'(w~), freq'(w't) , and N' are given below: 4fveq' (w, ,  ,w't) :f req(w, ,  w',) -- ~ f req(w, ,  wt, w',)~tfreq'(w,~) - f req(ws)freq'(w~t) - freq(w't)N'  -- N( f req ' (w , ,wt )  - f req(w, ,wt )  )When w~, wt, and w~ are co-occurring in a sentencebead, the co-occurrence of w~ and wt is preferred andthat of w~ and w I is ignored.
Thus, freq'(w,,w~t)is obtained by snbtracting the fi'equeney of all thosecases fiom the real co-occurrence frequency of w, andw' t. But, freq'(w~) and freq'(w~) are the same as thereal frequencies and the estimated word correspon-dences reflect he real co-occurrence frequencies in theinput text.
(Compare with Es t imat ion  II.)
Wordcorrespondences both included and not included inbilingual dictionaries are equally estimated their va-lidities.Est imat ion  II(File other is to remove from the input text all theco-occurrences of word pairs included in bilingual dic-tionaries, f req'(w,, 'a4) , freq'(w~), freq'(w~), ~md N'are given below:4It can happen thtLt, within it sentence bead, one word ofa language has more than one corresponding word~ of the Ol)-posite language and all the correspondences areincluded inbilinguM dictionaries.
In that case, formalizations in this sec-tion need some modifications.I079freq~(ws,w~t) =freq(w~, w't) - E freq(w~, wt, w~)Wefreq'(w~) = freq(w~) - E freq(w~'wt)wtfreq'(w't) = freq(w't) - E freq(w'~,w;),o,# and # (the correspondence of w~ w tis included in bilingual dictionaries)N '  = NWith this option, after all the co-occurrences of wordpairs included in bilingual dictionaries are removedfrom the input text, word correspondences not in-cluded in bilingual dictionaries are estimated theirvalidities.In the following sections, we temporarily adopt Es-t imat ion  I for estimating word correspondences notincluded in bilingual dictionaries.
It is necessary tofurther investigate and compare the two estimationmethods with large-scale xperiments.4 .3  Thresho ld  Funct ionAs a threshold function for extracting appropriatecorresponding word pairs, we use a hyperbolic fimc-tion of word frequency and estimated value for wordcorrespondence.At first, we define the following variables andconstants:x = (co-occurrence frequency)y = (estimated value for word correspondence)a = (constant for eliminating low frequencywords) ( 1.0 for both h 9 and hk )b = (constant for eliminating words)with low estimated value)( 0.1 for h a and 0.3 for hk )c - (lower bound of word frequency)( 2.5 for both h a and hk )Then, the threshold function g(x, y) is defined as be-low:g(~,y) = ~(~-b) (~>c)aAnd the condition for extracting corresponding wordpairs is given below:g(x,y) > 1 , x>cWhen using extracted word correspondences in sen-tence alignment and structural matching, at presentwe ignore the estimated values and use estimatedword correspondences and word correspondences inbilingual dictionaries equally.SNote that values for constants arc determined temporarilyand need fllrther investigation with large-scale xperiments.Especially, constants related to word frequency have to betnned to the length of texts.5 Exper iment  and  Eva luat ionIn this section, we report the results of a small ex-periment on aligning sentences in bilingual texts andstatistically estimating word correspondences.The sentence alignment program and the word cor-respondence estimation program are named AlignCO.The processing steps of AlignCO are as follows:1.
Given a bilingual text, content words are ex-tracted from each sentence.2.
A Japanese-English dictionary of about 50,000 en-tries is consulted and word correspondence infor-mation is extracted for content words of each sen-tence.3.
The sentence alignment program namedAlignCO/A aligns sentences in the input text bythe method stated in section 3.2.4.
Given the aligned sentences in the bilingual text,the word correspondence stimation programnamed AlignCO/C estimates word correspon-dences which are not included in the Japanese-English dictionary with option Es t imat ion  I insection 4.2.5.
Combining word correspondence informationavailable in the Japanese-English dictionary andestimated by AlignCO/C, sentences in the inputtext are realigned.As input Japanese-English bilingual texts, weuse two short texts of different length - -  1) "TheDilemma of National Development and Democracy"(305 Japanese sentences and 300 English sentences,henceforth "dilemma"), 2) "Pacific Asia in the Post-Cold-War World" (134 Japanese sentences and 123English sentences, henceforth "cold-war").
Since theresults of Gale's method and Kay's method did notdiffer so much, we show the result of Gale's methodonly.5 .1  Sentence  A l ignmentThe followings are five best results of sentence align-ment before and after estimating word correspon-dences not included in the Japanese-English dictionary.
The results are improved after estimating wordcorrespondences not included in the bilingual dictio-nary.

"part of 1)hrase" means that the estimatedword correspondence an be considered ~ part of cor-responding phrases.
"errm" rate" is tile ratio of thenumber of "wrong" word correspondences to the to-tal nunlber.

F, specially, we described a nlethod for align-lug sentences using word correspondence information,and a method for estimating word correspondences,tot included in bilingual dictionaries.Fstimated word correspondence information willimprove the results of structural matching of bilimgual sentences, it will be reported in the future.
Withthe same techniques as those for estimating word co,'-respondences, it is quite easy 1;o estimate correspon-dences of phrases uch as noun phrases and idiomaticexpressions.
Then, the results of structural matchingwill be much more ilnproved.In order to inlprove the accuracy of sentence aligninent, we need to combine our word-correspondence-based method with those length-based methods inBrown et al (1991) and Gale and Church (1993).In the case of Japanese-English texts, the word-based nlethod in Brown et al (1991) inight be betterthan tile character-b~ed method in Gale and Church(1993).ReferencesBrown, P.
