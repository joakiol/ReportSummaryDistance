We dis-cuss various benefits of the network andchallenges involved in the development.The system is encoded in Lexical MarkupFramework (LMF) and we propose mod-ifications in LMF to accommodate Uni-versal Word Dictionary and SUMO.
Thisstandardized version of lexical knowledgebase of Indian Languages can now easilybe linked to similar global resources.1 IntroductionLexical resources play an important role in nat-ural language processing tasks.
Past couple ofdecades have shown an immense growth in the de-velopment of lexical resources such as wordnet,Wikipedia, ontologies etc.
These resources varysignificantly in structure and representation for-malism.In order to develop applications that can makeuse of different resources, it is essential to linkthese heterogeneous resources and develop a com-mon representation framework.
However, the dif-ferences in encoding of knowledge and multilin-guality are the major road blocks in developmentof such a framework.
Particularly, in a multilin-gual country like India, information is available inmany different languages.
In order to exchange in-formation across cultures and languages, it is es-sential to create an architecture to share variouslexical resources across languages.In this paper we present IndoNet, a lexical re-source created by merging wordnets of 18 dif-ferent Indian languages1, Universal Word Dictio-nary (Uchida et al, 1999) and an upper ontology,SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001).Universal Word (UW), defined by a headwordand a set of restrictions which give an unambigu-ous representation of the concept, forms the vo-cabulary of Universal Networking Language.
Sug-gested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) is thelargest freely available ontology which is linkedto the entire English WordNet (Niles and Pease,2003).
Though UNL is a graph based repre-sentation and SUMO is a formal ontology, bothprovide language independent conceptualization.This makes them suitable candidates for interlin-gua.IndoNet is encoded in Lexical Markup Frame-work (LMF), an ISO standard (ISO-24613) forencoding lexical resources (Francopoulo et al,2009).The contribution of this work is twofold,1.
We propose an architecture to link lexical re-sources of Indian languages.2.
We propose modifications in Lexical MarkupFramework to create a linked structure ofmultilingual lexical resources and ontology.2 Related WorkOver the years wordnet has emerged as the mostwidely used lexical resource.
Though most of thewordnets are built by following the standards laidby English Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998), their con-ceptualizations differ because of the differences inlexicalization of concepts across languages.
?Not1Wordnets for Indian languages are developed in In-doWordNet project.
Wordnets are available in followingIndian languages: Assamese, Bodo, Bengali, English, Gu-jarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Konkani, Kannada, Malayalam, Ma-nipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu andUrdu.
These languages covers 3 different language families,Indo Aryan, Sino-Tebetian and Dravidian.http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/indowordnet268only that, there exist lexical gaps where a wordin one language has no correspondence in anotherlanguage, but there are differences in the ways lan-guages structure their words and concepts?.
(Peaseand Fellbaum, 2010).The challenge of constructing a unified multi-lingual resource was first addressed in EuroWord-Net (Vossen, 1998).
EuroWordNet linked word-nets of 8 different European languages througha common interlingual index (ILI).
ILI consistsof English synsets and serves as a pivot to linkother wordnets.
While ILI allows each languagewordnet to preserve its semantic structure, it hastwo basic drawbacks as described in Fellbaum andVossen (2012),1.
An ILI tied to one specific language clearlyreflects only the inventory of the language itis based on, and gaps show up when lexiconsof different languages are mapped to it.2.
The semantic space covered by a word in onelanguage often overlaps only partially with asimilar word in another language, resulting inless than perfect mappings.Subsequently in KYOTO project2, ontologies arepreferred over ILI for linking of concepts of dif-ferent languages.
Ontologies provide language in-dpendent conceptualization, hence the linking re-mains unbiased to a particular language.
Top levelontology SUMO is used to link common baseconcepts across languages.
Because of the smallsize of the top level ontology, only a few wordnetsynsets can be linked directly to the ontologicalconcept and most of the synsets get linked throughsubsumption relation.
This leads to a significantamount of information loss.KYOTO project used Lexical Markup Frame-work (LMF) (Francopoulo et al, 2009) as a rep-resentation language.
?LMF provides a com-mon model for the creation and use of lexical re-sources, to manage the exchange of data amongthese resources, and to enable the merging of alarge number of individual electronic resources toform extensive global electronic resources?
(Fran-copoulo et al, 2009).
Soria et al (2009) proposedWordNet-LMF to represent wordnets in LMF for-mat.
Henrich and Hinrichs (2010) have furthermodified Wordnet-LMF to accommodate lexical2http://kyoto-project.eu/xmlgroup.iit.cnr.it/kyoto/index.htmlrelations.
LMF also provides extensions for multi-lingual lexicons and for linking external resources,such as ontology.
However, LMF does not explic-itly define standards to share a common ontologyamong multilingual lexicons.Our work falls in line with EuroWordNet andKyoto except for the following key differences,?
Instead of using ILI, we use a ?common con-cept hierarchy?
as a backbone to link lexiconsof different languages.?
In addition to an upper ontology, a concept incommon concept hierarchy is also linked toUniversal Word Dictionary.
Universal Worddictionary provides additional semantic in-formation regarding argument types of verbs,that can be used to provide clues for selec-tional preference of a verb.?
We refine LMF to link external resources(e.g.
ontologies) with multilingual lexiconand to represent Universal Word Dictionary.3 IndoNetIndoNet uses a common concept hierarchy tolink various heterogeneous lexical resources.
Asshown in figure 1, concepts of different wordnets,Universal Word Dictionary and Upper Ontologyare merged to form the common concept hierar-chy.
Figure 1 shows how concepts of EnglishWordNet (EWN), Hindi Wordnet (HWN), upperontology (SUMO) and Universal Word Dictionary(UWD) are linked through common concept hier-archy (CCH).This section provides details of Common Con-cept Hierarcy and LMF encoding for different re-sources.Figure 1: An Example of Indonet Structure269Figure 2: LMF representation for Universal Word Dictionary3.1 Common Concept Hierarchy (CCH)The common concept hierarchy is an abstract pivotindex to link lexical resources of all languages.
Anelement of a common concept hierarchy is definedas < sinid1, sinid2, ..., uwid, sumoid > where,sinidi is synset id of ith wordnet, uw id is univer-sal word id, and sumo id is SUMO term id of theconcept.
Unlike ILI, the hypernymy-hyponymyrelations from different wordnets are merged toconstruct the concept hierarchy.
Each synset ofwordnet is directly linked to a concept in ?com-mon concept hierarchy?.3.2 LMF for WordnetWe have adapted the Wordnet-LMF, as specifiedin Soria et al (2009).
However IndoWordnetencodes more lexical relations compared to Eu-roWordnet.
We enhanced the Wordnet-LMF to ac-commodate the following relations: antonym, gra-dation, hypernymy, meronym, troponymy, entail-ment and cross part of speech links for ability andcapability.3.3 LMF for Universal Word DictionaryA Universal Word is composed of a headword anda list of restrictions, that provide unique meaningof the UW.
In our architecture we allow each senseof a headword to have more than one set of restric-tions (defined by different UW dictionaries) andbe linked to lemmas of multiple languages with aconfidence score.
This allows us to merge multipleUW dictionaries and represent it in LMF format.We introduce four new LMF classes; Restrictions,Restriction, Lemmas and Lemma and add new at-tributes; headword and mapping score to existingLMF classes.Figure 2 shows an example of LMF represen-tation of UW Dictionary.
At present, the dic-tionary is created by merging two dictionaries,UW++ (Boguslavsky et al, 2007) and CFILTHin-UW3.
Lemmas from different languages aremapped to universal words and stored under theLemmas class.3.4 LMF to link ontology with CommonConcept HierarchyFigure 3 shows an example LMF representationof CCH.
The interlingual pivot is representedthrough SenseAxis.
Concepts in different re-sources are linked to the SenseAxis in such a waythat concepts linked to same SenseAxis convey thesame Sense.Using LMF class MonolingualExternalRefs,ontology can be integrated with a monolinguallexicon.
In order to share an ontology among mul-tilingual resources, we modify the original corepackage of LMF.As shown in figure 3, a SUMO term is sharedacross multiple lexicons via the SenseAxis.
SUMOis linked with concept hierarchy using the follow-3http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/?hdict/webinterface_user/270Figure 3: LMF representation for Common Concept Hierarchying relations: antonym, hypernym, instance andequivalent.
In order to support these relations,Reltype attribute is added to the interlingual Senseclass.4 ObservationTable 1 shows part of speech wise status of linkedconcepts4.
The concept hierarchy contains 53848concepts which are shared among wordnets of In-dian languages, SUMO and Universal Word Dic-tionary.
Out of the total 53848 concepts, 21984 arelinked to SUMO, 34114 are linked to HWN and44119 are linked to UW.
Among these, 12,254 arecommon between UW and SUMO and 21984 arecommon between wordnet and SUMO.POS HWN UW SUMO CCHadjective 5532 2865 3140 5193adverb 380 2697 249 2813noun 25721 32831 16889 39620verb 2481 5726 1706 6222total 34114 44119 21984 53848Table 1: Details of the concepts linkedThis creates a multilingual semantic lexiconthat captures semantic relations between conceptsof different languages.
Figure 1 demonstratesthis with an example of ?kinship relation?.
As4Table 1 shows data for Hindi Wordnet.
Statistics forother wordnets can be found at http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/iwn_stats.phpshown in Figure 1, ?uncle?
is an English lan-guage concept defined as ?the brother of your fa-ther or mother?.
Hindi has no concept equivalentto ?uncle?
but there are two more specific concepts?kaka?, ?brother of father.?
and ?mama?, ?brotherof mother.
?The lexical gap is captured when these con-cepts are linked to CCH.
Through CCH, these con-cepts are linked to SUMO term ?FamilyRelation?which shows relation between these concepts.Universal Word Dictionary captures exact rela-tion between these concepts by applying restric-tions [chacha] uncle(icl>brother (mod>father))and [mama] uncle(icl>brother (mod>mother)).This makes it possible to link concepts across lan-guages.5 ConclusionWe have presented a multilingual lexical resourcefor Indian languages.
The proposed architecturehandles the ?lexical gap?
and ?structural diver-gence?
among languages, by building a commonconcept hierarchy.
In order to encode this resourcein LMF, we developed standards to represent UWin LMF.IndoNet is emerging as the largest multilingualresource covering 18 languages of 3 different lan-guage families and it is possible to link or mergeother standardized lexical resources with it.Since Universal Word dictionary is an integralpart of the system, it can be used for UNL based271Machine Translation tasks.
Ontological structureof the system can be used for multilingual infor-mation retrieval and extraction.In future, we aim to address ontological issuesof the common concept hierarchy and integratedomain ontologies with the system.
We are alsoaiming to develop standards to evaluate such mul-tilingual resources and to validate axiomatic foun-dation of the same.
We plan to make this resourcefreely available to researchers.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the support of the Department ofInformation Technology (DIT), Ministry of Com-munication and Information Technology, Gov-ernment of India and also of Ministry of Hu-man Resource Development.
