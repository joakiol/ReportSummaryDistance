DorrInstitute of Advanced Computer StudiesDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of MarylandCollege Park, MD 20742, USAbonnie@umiacs.umd.eduAbstractSemFrame generates FrameNet-likeframes, complete with semantic roles andevoking lexical units.
This output canenhance FrameNet by suggesting newframes, as well as additional lexical unitsthat evoke existing frames.
SemFrameoutput can also support the addition offrame semantic relationships to WordNet.1 IntroductionThe intuition that semantic analysis can make a posi-tive contribution to language-based applications hasmotivated the development of a number of lexical-semantic resources.
Prominent among them areWordNet,1 PropBank,2 and FrameNet.3 The poten-tial contribution of these resources is constrained bythe information they contain and the level of effortinvolved in their development.For example, semantic annotation tasks (Baker etal., 2004) typically assign semantic roles to the ar-guments of predicates.
The benefit of the semanticannotation is constrained by the presence and qualityof semantic roles in the lexical-semantic resource(s)used.
Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) suggest that theavailability of semantic annotation of this sort is use-ful for information extraction, word sense disam-biguation, machine translation, text summarization,text mining, and speech recognition.1http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/?wn2http://www.cis.upenn.edu/?ace3http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.eduOther tasks rely on the identification of seman-tic relationships to recognize lexical chains (sets ofsemantically related words that enable a text to becohesive) (Morris and Hirst, 1991).
The successof this work is constrained by the set of semanticrelationship types and instantiations underlying therecognition of lexical chains.
As Stokes?s disser-tation (2004) notes, lexical cohesion has been usedin discourse analysis, text segmentation, word sensedisambiguation, text summarization, topic detectionand tracking, and question answering.Unfortunately, most lexical-semantic resources,including those previously mentioned, are the prod-uct of considerable ongoing human effort.
Giventhe high development costs associated with these re-sources, the possibility of enhancing them on thebasis of complementary resources that are producedautomatically is welcome.This paper demonstrates several of the character-istics and benefits of SemFrame (Green et al, 2004;Green and Dorr, 2004), a system that produces sucha resource.1.
SemFrame generates semantic frames in a formlike those of FrameNet, the ostensible goldstandard for semantic frames.2.
Some SemFrame frames correspond toFrameNet frames.
When SemFrame identifiesadditional lexical units that evoke the frame,it bolsters the use of semantic frames foridentifying lexical chains.3.
Some SemFrame frames cover semantic spacenot yet investigated in FrameNet, which, be-57cause of the labor-intensive nature of its de-velopment, is incomplete.
The identification ofnew frames thus helps fill in gaps in FrameNet.4.
In addition to complementing FrameNet, Sem-Frame could be used as a more systematicsource of semantic roles for PropBank or couldserve as the basis for adding frame semantic re-lationships to WordNet.The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 2 discusses lexical-semantic resources thatcould be enhanced by using SemFrame?s output.Section 3 sets out how SemFrame works, with Sub-sections 3.1 and 3.2 explaining, respectively, theidentification of lexical units that evoke shared se-mantic frames and the generation of the internalstructure of those frames.
Section 4 discusses howwe evaluate SemFrame?s output.
Finally, Section 5summarizes SemFrame?s contributions and sketchesfuture directions in its development.2 Lexical-Semantic ResourcesLexical-semantic resources, such as FrameNet andPropBank, which involve semantic frames and/orsemantic roles, are one kind of resource that Sem-Frame?s output can enhance.
SemFrame could alsobenefit a resource like WordNet that captures differ-ent kinds of semantic relationships.
Here we discusscharacteristics of these resources that make themamenable to enhancement through SemFrame.2.1 FrameNetFrameNet documents the semantic and syntactic be-havior of words with respect to frames.
A framecharacterizes a conventional conceptual structure,for instance, a situation involving risk, a hittingevent, a commercial transaction.
Lexical units aresaid to evoke a frame.
For example, use of the literalsense of buy introduces into a discourse an expecta-tion that some object or service (the Goods) passesfrom one person (the Seller) to another (the Buyer)in exchange for something of (presumably equiva-lent) value (typically Money).A significant contribution of the FrameNet projectis the creation of frames, which involves the enumer-ation both of participant roles in the frame (a.k.a,frame elements, frame slots) and of lexical units thatevoke the frame.
As of May 2005, 657 frames havebeen defined in FrameNet; approximately 8600 lex-ical unit/frame associations have been made.FrameNet?s approach to identifying frames is?opportunistic?
and driven by the corpus data beingannotated.
Thus the FrameNet team does not ex-pect to have a full inventory of frames until a sub-stantial proportion of the general-purpose vocabu-lary of English has been analyzed.
As the develop-ment of FrameNet is labor-intensive, supplementingFrameNet?s frames and evoking lexical units usingdata from SemFrame would be beneficial.2.2 PropBankLike FrameNet, PropBank (Kingsbury et al, 2002)is a project aimed at semantic annotation, in thiscase of the Penn English Treebank.4 The intent ofPropBank is to provide for ?automatic extraction ofrelational data?
on the basis of consistent labelingof predicate argument relationships.
Typically thelabels/semantic roles are verb-specific (but are of-ten standardized across synonyms).
For example,the set of semantic arguments for promise, pledge,etc.
(its ?roleset?)
includes the promiser, the personpromised to, and the promised thing or action.
Thesecorrespond respectively to FrameNet?s Speaker, Ad-dressee, and Message elements within the Commit-ment frame.The more general labels used in FrameNet andSemFrame give evidence of a more systematic ap-proach to semantic argument structure, more eas-ily promoting the discovery of relationships amongframes.
It can be seen from the terminology usedthat PropBank is more focused on the individual ar-guments of the semantic argument structure, whileFrameNet and SemFrame are more focused on theoverall gestalt of the argument structure, that is, theframe.
The use of FrameNet and SemFrame to sug-gest more generic (that is, frame-relevant) roleset la-bels would help move PropBank toward greater sys-tematicity.4The semantic annotation tasks in the FrameNet and Prop-Bank projects enable them to link semantic roles and syntacticbehavior.
Enhancing and stabilizing its semantic frame inven-tory must precede the inclusion of such linkage in SemFrame.582.3 WordNetWordNet is a lexical database for English nouns,verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
Fine-grained sensedistinctions are recognized and organized into syn-onym sets (?synsets?
), WordNet?s basic unit of anal-ysis; each synset has a characterizing gloss, andmost are exemplified through one or more phrasesor sentences.In addition to the synonymy relationship at theheart of WordNet, other semantic relationships arereferenced, including, among others, antonymy, hy-ponymy, troponymy, partonomy, entailment, andcause-to.
On the basis of these relationships, Fell-baum (1998) noted that WordNet reflected the struc-ture of frame semantics to a degree, but suggestedthat its organization by part of speech would pre-clude a full frame-semantic approach.With release 2.0, WordNet added morphologicaland topical category relationships that cross overpart-of-speech boundaries.
This development relatesto incorporating a full frame-semantic approach inWordNet in two ways.First, since the lexical units that evoke a frame arenot restricted to a single part of speech, the abilityto create links between parts of speech is required inorder to encode frame semantic relationships.Second, topical categories (e.g., slang, meat,navy, Arthurian legend, celestial body, historicallinguistics, Mafia) have a kinship with semanticframes, but are not the same.
While topical cate-gory domains map between categories and lexicalitems?as do semantic frames?it is often not clearwhat internal structure might be posited for a cate-gory domain.
What, for example, would the partici-pant structure of ?meat?
look like?Should WordNet choose to adopt a full frame-semantic approach, FrameNet and SemFrameare natural starting points for identifying frame-semantic relationships between synsets.
The mostbeneficial enhancement would involve WordNet?sincorporating FrameNet and/or SemFrame framesas a separate resource, with a mapping betweenWordNet?s synsets and the semantic frame inven-tory.
SemFrame has the extra advantage that its lex-ical units are already identified as WordNet synsets.3 Development of SemFrameThere are two main processing stages in producingSemFrame output: The first establishes verb classes,while the second generates semantic frames.
Thenext two subsections describe these stages.3.1 Establishing Verb ClassesSemFrame adopts a multistep approach to identify-ing sets of frame-semantically related verb senses.The basic steps involved in the current version5 ofSemFrame are:1.
Building a graph with WordNet verb synsets asvertices and semantic relationships as edges2.
Identifying for each vertex a maximal highlyconnected component (HCC) (i.e., a highly in-terconnected subgraph that the vertex is part of)3.
Eliminating HCC?s with undesirable qualities4.
Forming preliminary verb semantic classes bysupplementing HCC?s with reliable semanticrelationships5.
Merging verb semantic classes with a high de-gree of overlapBuilding the Relationships GraphWordNet 2.0 includes a vast array of semanticrelationships between synsets of the same part ofspeech and has now been enhanced with relation-ships linking synsets of different parts of speech.Some of these relationships are almost guaranteedto link synsets that evoke the same frame, while oth-ers operate within the bounds of a semantic frameon some occasions, but not others.
Among the re-lationship types in WordNet most fruitful for iden-tifying verb synsets within the same frame seman-tic verb class are: synonymy (e.g., buy, purchase,as collocated within synsets), antonymy (e.g., buy,5The process of establishing verb classes has been re-designed.
All that has been carried over from the previ-ous/initial version of SemFrame is the use of some of the sameWordNet relationships.
New in the current version are: the useof relationship types first implemented in WordNet 2.0, the pre-dominant and exclusive use of WordNet as the source of data(the previous version used WordNet as a source secondary tothe Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English), and mod-eling the identification of classes of related verbs as a graph,specifically through the use of highly connected components.59sell), cause-to (e.g., transfer, change hands), en-tailment (e.g., buy, pay), verb group (e.g., differentcommercial senses of buy, morphological derivation(e.g., buy, buyer),6 and ?see also?
(e.g., buy, buyout).
Instances of these relationship types for allverb synsets in WordNet 2.0 are represented as edgeswithin the graph.Additional edges are inserted between any twosynsets/vertices related by two or more of the fol-lowing: clustering of synsets based on the occur-rence of word stems in their glosses and examplesentences;7 hyperonymy/hyponymy relationships;and category domain relationships.
These three rela-tionship types are too noisy to be used on their ownfor identifying frame semantic relationships amongsynsets, but when a relationship is verified by two ormore of these relationships, the likelihood that therelated synsets evoke the same frame is considerablyhigher.
Table 1 summarizes the number of edges inthe graph supported by each relationship type.Relationship Type CountAntonymy 502Cause-to 218Entailment 409Verb group 874Morphological derivation 8,986See also 539Two of: 2,223Clustering 54,298Hyperonymy/hyponymy 12,985Category domain 18,482Total 13,751Table 1: Relationship Counts in WordNet 2.0Identifying Highly Connected Components(HCC?s)Step 1 constructs a graph interconnecting thou-sands of WordNet verb synsets.
Identifying sets ofverb synsets likely to evoke the same semantic framerequires identifying subgraphs with a high degreeof interconnectivity.
Empirical investigation has6SemFrame relates verb synsets with a morphologicalderivation relationship to a common noun synset.
This includesverbs related to different members of the shared noun synset.7Voorhees?
(1986) hierarchical agglomerative clustering al-gorithm was implemented.Figure 1: Relationships Subgraph with HCCshown that ?highly connected components?
(Har-tuv and Shamir, 2000)?induced subgraphs of sizek in which every vertex?s connectivity exceeds k2vertices?identify such sets of verb synsets.8 Forexample, in a 5-vertex highly connected component,each vertex is related to at least 3 other vertices.
Fig-ure 1 shows a portion of the original graph in whichrelationship arcs constituting an HCC are given assolid lines, while those that fail the interconnectivitythreshold are given as dotted lines.Given an undirected graph, the Hartuv-Shamir al-gorithm for identifying HCC?s returns zero or morenon-overlapping subgraphs (including zero or moresingleton vertices).
But it is inaccurate to assumethat verb synsets evoke only a single frame, as issuggested by non-overlapping subgraphs.9 For thisreason, we have modified the Hartuv-Shamir algo-rithm to identify a maximal HCC, if one exists, for(i.e., that includes) each vertex of the graph.
Thismodification reduces the effort involved in identify-ing any single HCC: Since the diameter of a HCCis no greater than two, only those vertices who areneighbors of the source vertex, or neighbors of thoseneighbors, need to be examined.8The algorithm for computing HCC?s first finds the mini-mum cut for a (sub)graph.
If the graph meets the highly con-nected component criterion, the graph is returned, else the al-gorithm is called recursively on each of the subgraphs createdby the cut.
The Stoer-Wagner (1997) algorithm has been imple-mented for finding the minimum cut.9Semantic frames can be defined at varying levels of gen-erality; thus, a given synset may evoke a set of hierarchicallyrelated frames.
Words/Synsets may also evoke multiple, unre-lated frames simultaneously; criticize, for example, evokes botha Judging frame and a Communication frame.60Eliminating DuplicatesBecause HCC?s were generated for each vertexin the relationships graph, considerable duplicationand overlap existed in the output.
The output ofstep 2 was cleaned up using three filters.
First,duplicate HCC?s were eliminated.
Second, anyHCC wholly included within another HCC wasdeleted.10 Third, any HCC based only on mor-phological derivation relationships was deleted.
InSemFrame, all verb synsets morphologically derivedfrom the same noun synset were related to eachother.
Thus all verb synsets derived from a commonnoun synset are guaranteed to generate an HCC.
Ifonly such relationships support an HCC, the likeli-hood that all of the interrelated verb synsets evokethe same semantic frame is much lower than if othertypes of relationships also provide evidence for theirinterrelationship.Supplementing HCC?sThe HCC?s generated in step 2 that survived thefilters implemented in step 3 form the basis of verbframesets, that is, sets of verb senses that evoke thesame semantic frame.
Specifically, all the synsetsrepresented by vertices in a single HCC form aframeset.The connectivity threshold imposed by HCC?shelps maintain reasonably high precision of the re-sulting framesets, but is too strict for high recall.Some types of relationships known to operate withinframe-semantic boundaries generally do not survivethe connectivity threshold cutoff.
For example, forframes of a certain level of generality, if a spe-cific verb evokes that frame, it is also the case thatits antonym evokes the frame, as antonyms operateagainst the backdrop of the same situational con-text; that is, they share participant structure.11 How-ever, since antonymy is (only) a lexical relationshipbetween two word senses, A and B, the tight cou-pling of A and B is unlikely to be reflected in A?sbeing directly related to other synsets that are re-lated to B and vice-versa.
Thus, antonyms are un-10Given the interest in generating semantic frames of varyinglevels of generality, this filter may itself be eliminated in thefuture.11Identifying antonyms is especially helpful in the case ofconversives, as with buy and sell; the inclusion of both in theframeset promotes discovery of all relevant frame participants,in this case, both buyer and seller.likely to be highly connected through WordNet toother words/synsets that evoke the frame and thusfail the HCC connectivity threshold.
The same ar-gument can be made for causatively related verbs.A post-processing step was required therefore to addto a frameset any verb synsets related through Word-Net?s antonymy or cause-to relationships to a mem-ber of the frameset.
Similarly, any verb synset en-tailed by a member of a verb frameset was added tothe frameset.Other verb synsets fail to survive the connectivitythreshold cutoff because they enter into few relation-ships of any kind.
If a verb synset is related to onlyone other verb synset, the assumption is made that itevokes the same frame as that one other synset; it isthen added to the corresponding frameset.Lastly, if a synset is related to two or more mem-bers of a frameset, the likelihood that it evokes thesame semantic frame is reasonably high.
Such verbsynsets were added to the frameset if not alreadypresent.At the end of this phase, any framesets wholly in-cluded within another frameset were again deleted.Merging Overlapping Verb ClassesThe preceding processes produced many frame-sets with a significant degree of overlap.
For anytwo framesets, if at least half of the verb synsets inboth framesets were also members of the other, thetwo framesets were merged into a single frameset.Summary of Stage 1 ResultsThe above steps generated 1434 framesets, vary-ing in size from 2 to 25 synsets (see Table 2).
Smallframesets dominate the results, with over 60% of theframesets including only 2 or 3 synsets.Representative examples of these framesets aregiven in Appendix A, where members of each synsetappear in parentheses, followed by the synset?sgloss.
(Examples are ordered by frameset size.
)Smaller and medium-sized framesets generally en-joy high precision, but many of the largest framesetswould be better split into two or more framesets.3.2 Generating Semantic FramesGenerating frames from verb framesets relies onthe insight that the semantic arguments of a frameare largely drawn from nouns associated with verb61Frameset Size Count2 5363 3464-5 3096-8 1699-12 5413-25 20Total 1434Table 2: Count of Frameset Sizessynsets in the frameset.
In SemFrame?s processing,these include nouns in the gloss of a verb synset or inthe gloss of its corresponding LDOCE verb sense(s),as well as nouns (that is, noun synsets) to whicha verb synset is morphologically related and thosenaming the category domain to which a verb synsetbelongs.
In the latter two cases, the nouns come dis-ambiguated within WordNet, but nouns from glossesmust undergo disambiguation.
The set of nounsenses associated with a verb frameset is then ana-lyzed against the WordNet noun hierarchy, using anadaptation of Agirre and Rigau?s (1995) conceptualdensity measure.
This analysis identifies a framename and a set of frame participants, all of whichcorrespond to nodes in the WordNet noun hierarchy.Disambiguating Nouns from GlossesFirst we consider how nouns from WordNet andLDOCE verb glosses are disambiguated.12 This stepinvolves looking for matches between the stems ofwords in the glosses of WordNet noun synsets thatinclude the noun needing to be disambiguated, onthe one hand, and the stems of words in the glossesof all WordNet verb synsets (and correspondingLDOCE verb senses) in the frameset, on the otherhand.A similarity score is computed by dividing thematch count by the number of non-stop-word stemsin the senses under consideration.
SemFrame favorspredominant senses by examining word senses infrequency order.
Any sense with a non-zero similar-ity score that is the highest score yet seen is chosenas an appropriate word sense.The various nodes within WordNet?s noun net-12Identification of LDOCE verb senses that correspond toWordNet verb synsets is carried out using a similar strategy.work that correspond to a verb frameset?eitherthrough morphological derivation or category do-main relationships in WordNet or through the dis-ambiguation of nouns from the glosses of verbs inthe frameset?constitute ?evidence synsets?
for theparticipant structure of the corresponding semanticframe and form the input for the conceptual densitycalculation.In preparation for use in calculating conceptualdensity, evidence synsets are given weights thattake into account the source and basis of the dis-ambiguation.
In the current implementation, nounsynsets related to the frameset through morpho-logical derivation or shared category domain aregiven a weight of 4.0 (the nouns are guaranteedto be related to the verbs, and disambiguation ofthe nouns is built into the fact that relationshipsare given between synsets); disambiguated nounsynsets coming from WordNet verb synsets receivea weight of 2.0 (since the original framesets containWordNet synsets, and the disambiguation strategy isfairly conservative); non-disambiguated nouns com-ing from LDOCE verbs related to the frameset havea weight of 0.5 (LDOCE verbs are a step removedfrom the original framesets, and the nouns havenot been disambiguated); all other nouns receive aweight of 1.0.
The weight for non-disambiguatednouns is ultimately distributed across the noun?ssenses, with higher proportions of the weight beingassigned to more frequent senses.Computing Conceptual DensityThe overall idea behind transforming the list ofevidence synsets into a list of participants involvesusing the relationship structure of WordNet to iden-tify an appropriately small set of concepts (i.e.,synsets) within WordNet that account for (i.e., aresuperordinate to) as many of the evidence synsets aspossible; such synsets will be referred to as ?cover-ing synsets?.This task relies on the hypothesis that a frame?sevidence synsets will not be randomly distributedacross WordNet, but will be clustered in various sub-trees within the hierarchy.
Intuitively, when evi-dence synsets cluster together, the subtrees in whichthey occur will be more dense than those subtreeswhere few or no evidence synsets occur.
It is hy-pothesized that the WordNet subtrees with the high-62est density are the most likely to correspond toframe slots.
Thus, the task is to identify such clus-ters/subtrees and then to designate the nodes at theroots of the subtrees as covering synsets (subject tocertain constraints).The conceptual density measure we have used hasbeen inspired by the measure of the same name inAgirre and Rigau (1995).
The conceptual density,CD(n), of a node n is computed as follows:CD(n) =?idescendantsn(wgti ?
treesizei)treesizenBoth frame names and frame slots are identifiedon the basis of this conceptual density measure, withthe frame name being taken from the node with thehighest conceptual density from a specified groupof subnetworks within the WordNet noun network(including abstractions, actions, events, phenomena,psychological features, and states).
Frame slotsare subject to a density threshold (based on meandensity and variance), an evidence-synset-supportthreshold, and a constraint on the number of pos-sible slots to be taken from specific subnetworkswithin WordNet.
Further details on the computationand interpretation of conceptual density are givenin (Green and Dorr, 2004).Frame names and frame structures forthe framesets in Appendix A are givenin Appendix B.
The full set of Sem-Frame?s frames (including ca.
30,000 lexicalunit/frame associations) is publicly available at:http://www.cs.umd.edu/?rgreen/semframe2.tar.gz.The correspondence between frameset sizes andthe number of slots generated for the frame is worthnoting, since we have independent evidence aboutthe number of slots that should be generated.
Framesin FrameNet generally have from 1 to 5 slots (occa-sionally more).
Over 70% of SemFrame?s framescontain from 1 to 5 frame slots.
Of course, generat-ing an appropriate number of frame slots is not thesame as generating the right frame slots, a determi-nation that requires empirical investigation.4 EvaluationThree student judges evaluated SemFrame?s results,with 200 frames each assessed by two judges, and1234 frames each assessed by one judge.In evaluating a frame, judges began by examiningthe set of verb synsets deemed to evoke a commonframe and identified from among them the largestsubset of synsets they considered to evoke the sameframe.
This frame?designated the ?target frame?
?was simply a mental construct in the judge?s mind.For only 9% of the frame judgments were the judgesunable to identify a target frame.If a target frame was discerned, judges werethen asked to evaluate whether the WordNet verbsynsets and LDOCE verb senses listed by Sem-Frame could be used to communicate about theframe the judge had in mind.
This evaluation stepapplied to 6147 WordNet verb synsets and 7148LDOCE verb senses; in the judges?
views, 78% ofthe synsets and 68% of the verb senses evoke thetarget frame.Judges were asked how well the frame namesgenerated by SemFrame capture the overall targetframe.
Some 53% of the names were perceived to besatisfactory (good or excellent), with another 25%of the names in the right hierarchy.
Only 11% of thenames were deemed to be only mediocre and 9% tobe unrelated.Judges were also asked how well the frame ele-ment names generated by SemFrame named a par-ticipant or attribute of the target frame.
Here 46%of the names were found satisfactory, with another18% of the names consistent with a target frame par-ticipant, but either too general or too narrow.
An-other 5% of the names were regarded as mediocreand 30% as unrelated.Lastly, judges were asked to look for corre-spondences between target frames and FrameNetframes.
While only 17% of the target frames wereconsidered equivalent to a FrameNet frame, manywere judged to be hierarchically related; 51% ofthe FrameNet frames were judged more generalthan the corresponding SemFrame frame, while 8%were judged more specific.
This reflects the needto combine some number of SemFrame frames.For 23% of the SemFrame frames, even the bestFrameNet match was considered only mediocre.These may represent viable frames not yet recog-nized by FrameNet.
Judges also found 3668 verbsin SemFrame that could be appropriately listed for acorresponding frame in FrameNet, but were not.These results reveal SemFrame?s strengths in in-63ducing frames by enumerating sets of verbs thatevoke a shared frame and in naming such frames.SemFrame?s ability to postulate names for the ele-ments of a frame is less robust, although results inthis area are still noteworthy.5 Conclusion and Future WorkSemFrame?s output can be used to enhance lexical-semantic resources in various ways.
For example,WordNet has recently incorporated new relationshiptypes, some of which touch on frame semantic re-lationships.
But frame semantic relationships are asyet only implicit in WordNet; not all morphologicalderivation relationships, for example, operate withina frame.
Should WordNet choose to reflect framesemantic relationships, SemFrame would provide auseful point of departure, since the verb framesets,frame names, and frame slots are all already ex-pressed as WordNet synsets.SemFrame can also add to FrameNet.
The ex-tensive human effort that has gone into FrameNetis overwhelmingly evident in the quality of itsframe structures (and attendant annotations).
Sem-Frame is unlikely ever to compete with FrameNeton this score.
However, SemFrame has identi-fied frames not recognized in FrameNet, e.g., Sem-Frame?s SOILING frame.
SemFrame has like-wise identified lexical units appropriate to FrameNetframes that have not yet been incorporated intoFrameNet, e.g., stick to, stick with, and abide by inthe COMPLIANCE / CONFORMITY frame.
Thesecontributions would add as well to the semantic rep-resentations in PropBank.
Since identifying framesand their evoking lexical units from scratch re-quires more effort than assessing the general qual-ity of proposed frames and lexical units?indeed,since there is currently no other systematic way inwhich to identify either a universal set of seman-tic frames or the set of lexical items that evoke aframe?SemFrame?s ability to propose new framesand new evoking lexical units constitutes a majorcontribution to the development of lexical-semanticresources.SemFrame?s current results might themselves beenhanced by considering data from other parts ofspeech.
For instance, at present SemFrame basesall its frames on verb framesets, but some FrameNetframes list only adjectives as evoking lexical units.At the same time, potentially more can be done in as-sociating verb synsets with frames: Only one-thirdof WordNet?s verb synsets are now included in Sem-Frame?s output.
Some of those not now includedevoke none of SemFrame?s current frames, but somedo and have not yet been recognized.
Ways of estab-lishing hierarchical and compositional relationshipsamong frames should also be investigated.The above suggestions for enhancing SemFramenotwithstanding, major progress in improving Sem-Frame awaits incorporation of corpus data.
Rely-ing on data from lexical resources has contributedto SemFrame?s precision, but the data sparsenessbottleneck that SemFrame faces is nonetheless real.On the basis of the lexical resource data used, verbsynsets are related on average to only 5 nouns, manyof which closely reflect the participant structure ofthe corresponding frame.
However, it is not uncom-mon for specific elements of the participant structureto go unrepresented, and any nouns in the datasetthat are not particularly reflective of the participantstructure carry far too much weight amidst such apaucity of data.In contrast, the number of nouns that co-occurwith a verb in a corpus may be orders of magnitudegreater.13 But the nouns in a corpus are less likelyto reflect closely the participant structure of the cor-responding frame; many more nouns are thus likelyto be needed.
Furthermore, word sense disambigua-tion will be required to assign to a frame only thosenouns corresponding to an appropriate sense of theverb.14 We are optimistic, however, that the pres-ence of additional corpus data will help fill in frameelement gaps arising from the sparseness of lexicalresource data and can also be used to help reduce theimpact of nouns from lexical resource data that arenot representative of a frame?s participant structure.Coupled with subject-specific resources, the anal-ysis of corpus data may then lead to the development13We are investigating two levels of noun-verb co-occurrence.
The first counts co-occurrences of all nouns andverbs appearing within the same paragraph of newswire texts.The second counts only those nouns related to verbs as theirsubjects, direct objects, indirect objects, or as objects of prepo-sitional phrases that modify the verb.14We make the simplifying assumption that if a noun occurswith some reasonable percentage of the verbs within a frameset,the desired verb sense is in play.64of subject-specific frame inventories.
