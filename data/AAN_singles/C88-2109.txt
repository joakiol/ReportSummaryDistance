For every element x of IP there is ~l individual cou:itant inttm language 1.

The assigmnent of seman-tic-pragmatic categories to the elements of IP is a function, whichmaps every pair (x~C), where x e IP and C is the context, ontothe semanticiipragmatic categories of x, representing the status ofx with respect o C.The contextual labels are given (g), chosen (ch),mentioned (m), mentioned in the previous sentence (rap) and,their negation -,ch, -,m, ~mp.

In order to give an idea about the relation between the!single arguments of the representation f the iilocutionary plans'and their contextual status example 1 will be presented in ritefollowing order: rule number, assigned category and contexma~information.The arguments of the illocntionary planADRESSEE,OBJECT> yield the following labels:<TAKE,(1 ii) - - -  > g(TAKE)amk(TAKE*) e CO1, ueq(TAKE*) e CO t(1 i) - - -  > g(ADRESSEE)hearer(ADRESSEE*) e CO t(2 )  - - - > ((ch, -~m)(OBJECT))UHB(OBJECT*) E CO 2Therefore the new IP' is <g(TAKE),516g(ADRESSEE),((ch, -~m)(OBJECT))> and the application of rule (5) to the firstand second argument and of rule (10) to ~he ~tird urgament ofIP' givesIP" : < t(TAKE), t(ADRESSEE),f(OBJECT) >.The surface structure of the illocutionary plan ISP wonld be:"du nimmst einen retch Klotz" meaning "(you) rake a redblock".
Bold print within the examples designate possible occur-rences of accents and midedining highlights the words responsiblefor the cohesion of the surface tbrm.Exan l  1~@ 2Application of the rule toIP = <PUT,ADRESSEE~OBYFCT, GOAL:> gives:(1 ii) - - -  > y(PUT),(1 i) .
.
.
.
> g,(ADRESSEE),(3 iv) .
.
.
.
> ((-~ch,m,mp)(OBJECT)),(4) .
.
.
.
.
> ((ch, -,n0(GOAL)).In this ease the new illocutionary plan IP' is:< g(PUT),g(ADRESSEE),(( -,ch,m,mp)(OBJECT)),((ch, -m)(GOAL) >.The application 'of rule (5) to the first and second argmnenL ofrule (6) to the third and of rule (10) to the fourth argument of1P' givesIP": < t(PUT),t(ADRESSEE),t(OBJECT)),f(GOAL) >.The surface structure would be "du stellst ihu anf den tisch"meaning "put it on the table".Example 3In order to illustrate the application of the salient opic rule weassume that the following utterance is made as a consequence ofan illocutionary TAKE plan: "du nimmst einen r~en und einenblauen Klotz', meaning "take a red and a blue block".
Two iillocutionary PUT plans would follow:IP 1 = < PUT,ADRESSEE,OBJECT 1,GOAL,>,IP 2 = <PUT,ADRESSEE,OBJECT2,GOAL)>.For the first , second and fourth argument of the set 1P~ and IP 2the same conditions as in the above PUT examples hold.
For ritethird argument the following rules apply:(3 i) .
.
.
.
> ((ch,m,mp)(OBJECT1)),(3 iii) .
.
.
.
> (( "~ch,m, -~mp)(OBJECT~)).The new iUoeutioanry plans are therefore:IP I '=  <g(PUT),g(ADRESSEE),((ch,m~alp)(OBJECTI)),((ch, ~ m)(GOAL) >,IP2'= < A,(PUT) ,g(ADRESSEE),(ch, m, -~mp(OBJECT2)),((ch, ~m(GOAL) >.The application of rule (5) to the first and second argurncntz~ ofrule (7) to the third argument in lPl',of nile (9) to the fl~ird,argument of IP 2' and of rule (10) to the fbm~th arguments of ~?and IP 2' yields:IPI" = < t(PUT),t(ADRESSEE) j~(OBJECq'I)) ,f(CCOAL) >,IP2" = < t~PUT) ,t(ADRESSEF.
),~OBJEL~))~f(GOAL) > oTt~ surface slructure would be : "d~ ~l ls t  den r~t~a ~f  de~grt~nen mid den blanch anf den rotea ~ meaning "put the r~_~'~ Ithe green and the blue on the red".If in an illocntionary TAKE plan the third argmnent consists oflist of many obje6~, then for every object OBJ ch(OBJ) ~d-~m(OBJ) holds.
This can be abbreviated by tl~ oxpre~k~a~(ch, -~m)* of the formal language over tim ~lphabe~ A.

In file automatic generation of naturalla~g0age~ si~)oken ~ wel l  as written, the thematic progression ofa ~:equot~ ~, ~)f ta~rar~ces and their formal cohesion must also be~,~ken into consideration?
For the spoken lauguage prosodic cohe-sio~ mu,~t hc considered additionally.
Our rules for the identifica-tio~ of topic (0, .~alient opic (~t) and focus (f) guarantees thecoher~;nc~:: ,' the fl~ematic progression /DanEs 1970/ of two ormore sncce, sive utterm~ces of the action sequence.
Two verysiml)le rules for thematic progression with the respective numberof tht~ ex~ant)les above are now given.Rt: Tlxe o~)iy tbcussed OBJECT of a TAKE-action becomes thetopicalizexl OBJECT of the following PUTfi action (ex.l,2).~ :  The two/thrc.e focussed OBJECTS of the TAKEaction be-come ~ite OBJECT of the following tw0/three PUT actions~nld wilt be labelled salient topic (Ex.3).Oar topic, salient topic and focus identification rules also al-lows to m~ie predictions about the distribution of accents.
Indeedan accent will be assigned to the elements labelled salient topic(sO and fbcas (f); the topic elements (t) get no accents.
In thisphone of the work accents ale assigned to all arguments of theproposition.
The assignment of the accent to the adjective insteadof the nou)~ in phrases like "...den lx~ten..." involves application~of the same criteria inside lower level constituents.
In order togenerate cohesive surface structures it is also necessary to knowwhen to n~ a definite article within noun phrases (the last one :der letzte) or ,oat indefinite pronoun (one : ein).
This choice de-pends on the pragmatic decision of taking one or more blocksand on the; properties shared by the objects in question.
Underthe t~ssurnpdon that only the parallel processing semantic andpragmatic i,aformation allows the choice of appropriate lexicalmaterial.
For this purpose, we will extend our set of semanticcategories to express if a ce(tain objects is art underdetermined ora determined element of a set.
