Syntax to Semantics Transformation: Application to TreebankingManuel Alc?ntaraUniversidad Aut?noma de Madridmanuel@maria.lllf.uam.esAntonio MorenoUniversidad Aut?noma de Madridsandoval@maria.lllf.uam.esAbstractMapping between syntax and semantics is oneof the most promising research topics in cor-pus annotation.
This paper deals with the im-plementation of an semi-automatictransformation from a syntactically-taggedcorpus into a semantic-tagged one.
Themethod has been experimentally applied to a1600-sentence treebank (the UAM SpanishTreebank).
Results of evaluation  are providedas well as prospective work in comparingsyntax and semantics in written and spokenannotated corpora.1 IntroductionThis paper presents a new stage in the development ofthe UAM Spanish Treebank1 (syntactic annotation) andof  SESCO2 (semantic annotation), based on possiblerelationships between them.
Our aim is to achieve semi-automatic semantic tagging of the UAM Spanish Tree-bank.
To reach this goal, we have developed and im-plemented a program called SST (Syntax SemanticsTransformation).
The application of this tool providesus with three main benefits:First and foremost, our principal concern is a reli-able, quick and cost effective tagging of the treebank.Manual annotation would be time consuming and ex-pensive because of the complexity of the sentences.
Onthe other hand, automatic processing ensures coherenceand control over the tagging: each type will be taggedThe research of Manuel Alc?ntara has been supportedby a grant of the Spanish Ministerio de Educaci?n y Ciencia(FPU).1http://www.lllf.uam.es/~sandoval/UAMTreebank.html and Moreno et al (2003).2 http://www.lllf.uam.es/~manuel/sesco.htm and Al-c?ntara (2003).always with the same structure.
Our previous experiencein developing the UAM Spanish Treebank has led us tothis approach.Second, this experiment contributes to the study ofthe relationship between syntax and semantics showingthat an almost automatic transition from one level toanother is possible.
The idea of the connection betweenthese levels of the language is a commonplace in con-temporary linguistics and there are important theoreticalworks concerning the mapping between morpho-syntactic and semantic forms.
However these theorieshave not yet been applied to corpora.
Indeed, we are notaware of any similar experiments.Finally, through this research we have developed aset of grammatical rules connecting syntactic structuresto their correspondent event types.
It is worth mention-ing here that we have worked with corpora with no the-matic restrictions.
Therefore, these rules are not thoughtfor a particular sublanguage, but applicable to Spanishlanguage in general.2 UAM Spanish Treebank and SESCOIn order to understand the SST, it is interesting toconsider the characteristics of the corpora we have used.2.1 UAM Spanish Treebank (source corpus).The UAM Spanish Treebank of the UniversidadAut?noma de Madrid is a syntactically annotated corpusmade up of 1600 sentences taken from Spanishnewspapers (Moreno et al, 1999; Moreno et al, 2003).Since these sentences (particularly the first 500)were chosen as a sample of the complexity of Spanishsyntax, they cover an important range of syntacticstructures.
The fact that the sample was takenselectively from different sections of the sourcesreflecting different styles implies much morecomplexity.The format was based on the Penn Treebank, al-though the tag set has been adapted to the characteristicsof the Spanish language.
The corpus has recently beenconverted to an XML format, which has helped us a lotin our work.The Treebank has four different types of informa-tion:1.
Part-of-Speech (noun, verb, etc.)2.
Syntactic functions (SUBJ, DO, ATTR, etc.)3.
Morpho-syntactic features (gender, number,person, etc.)4.
Semantic features.
The UAM Spanish Treebankhas a group of tags called ?semantic features?which specify types of prepositional phrases(locative, time, etc.
)The aim of this annotation was to reflect the sur-face syntax.
The designers were thus very cautious inregards to empty categories and ambiguities: they usedthe features only in those cases with the highest cer-tainty.
Additionally,, the designers avoided redundancyas much as possible.The Treebank tag set has a flexible design allow-ing the addition of new features.
However as more fea-tures are added, annotation becomes more difficult,since the human tagger has to choose the suitable tagamong the available ones.2.2 SESCO (target corpus).SESCO is a tagging system which allows the semanticrepresentation of a linguistic corpus (Alc?ntara, 2003).It is coded using an XML markup and offers a practicalbasis for tagging both spoken and written corpora.The main goal of SESCO is to make an essentialand flexible analysis for extracting the largest possibleamount of data from a corpus without limiting it to anexcessively restrictive theory, taking the argumentstructure of verbs as starting-point.We back J.C. Moreno's proposal (J.C. Moreno1991a, 1991b, 1997) on event analysis, although wealso have considered other very similar approaches(Pustejovsky, 1995; Tenny and Pustejovsky, 2000).The events expressed by verbs can be of threemajor types, forming a universal hierarchy (J.C. Mo-reno, 1997):  states, processes and actions.
These threetypes are divided into subtypes according to the argu-ments they require.This approach is compositional: a state has two ar-guments, a process is made up of a transition from onestate to another, and an action is a process with anagent.
This leads to the logical consequence that weneed an annotation format for representing both the re-lation between events and the arguments of the sentenceand its sub-event structure.Most of the recent work on semantics focuses onontologies.
It is important to distinguish the fact thatSESCO does not have an ontology as a basis, but thatthe ontology can be a result of our work.SESCO has been developed taking as point of ref-erence the spoken corpus from the Computational Lin-guistics Laboratory of the Universidad Aut?noma deMadrid (http://www.lllf.uam.es/), which, in turn, formspart of the European project "C-ORAL-ROM"(http://lablita.dit.unifi.it/coralrom/).
Texts have beenrecorded following requirements of spontaneity, qualityof the sound and variety of speakers and contexts.At the beginning of our experiment, 49500 sponta-neous spoken words (4100 sentences) had been ana-lyzed in SESCO format.
These sentences are ourtraining corpus and the basis of our SESCO Data Base(SDB) of event structures.2.3 Main differences.Besides the linguistic background, there are three maindifferences between the syntactically annotated UAMTreebank and SESCO:First, whereas the Treebank is a corpus of writtentexts, SESCO contains only spontaneous speech ortho-grafic transcriptions.
As we expected, the vocabularywas not the same and the upshot of this was an increasein the number of unknown lemmas.
In actual fact, bothcorpora are designed for covering a wide range of topicsand registers.Second, the UAM Treebank tagset is far morecomplex than that of SESCO.
In this respect, the SSTprocess is a reduction and it does not use all the featuresincluded in the Treebank.
Syntactic functions and somesemantic features are the only information that SSTmakes use of.Finally, SST raises fundamental questions on theconcept of ?sentence?.
In the Treebank, the key is theorthography: the limits of a sentence are always estab-lished by dots.
In SESCO, a sentence is a completeevent.
Because of this, the 1600 sentences of the UAMSpanish Treebank corpus produce 1666 sentences in theSESCO version.
In spite of this, orthographic punctua-tion has been helpful in the task of recognizing the be-ginning of most of the sentences.Sentences Words EventsUAM Treebank 1666 23542 2230trainingSESCO corpus4100 49506 6530TOTAL 5766 73048 8760Table 1 Relevant figures in the corpora3 MethodologyThe input is a syntactically annotated sentence and theoutput is the same sentence semantically tagged.
Bothannotations are in XML and the involves five mainstages.
The first three stages are automatic, imple-mented in Perl.
The fourth (optional) stage is semi-automatic and the last one is a human-revision.3.1 Getting the event type.As pointed out earlier, our semantic tagging reflectsargument structures related to verbs.
Due to thistheoretical framework, the first step is to find the lemmaof the main verb.
It is an easy task since the treebankformat provides this information through a particularattribute ("lemma") in the element "verb".Once the lemma is found, the program searches theSDB for the most frequent event type for this lemma.This selection is made taking into account the syntacticstructure: for example, if it is a process and there is alocative complement, the most used displacement willbe chosen.The SDB data come from the previous analysis (formore details about the SESCO corpus, see section 2.2.
).That is, this stage is based on a probabilistic model andthe automatic mapping is example-based, findingsimilar examples already in the training corpus.3.2 From a syntactic structure to a semanticanalysis.In order to understand this second step, first of all it isnecessary to remark on some characteristics of theUAM Spanish Treebank.
When the UAM Treebank wasdesigned in 1997 (Moreno et al, 2003), the aim wasonly to build a syntactically annotated corpus followingthe Penn Treebank style ?
no consideration was given tothe possibility of its translation into a semantic corpus.Therefore the Treebank included only those featuresneeded for achieving a correct syntactic analysis.
Asmentioned above, the UAM Spanish Treebank uses thestandard Penn Treebank scheme with the addition ofsome features.
It provides a combination of Part ofSpeech information with specific grammatical featuresof words and phrases.In SST, this syntactic data is transformed into anevent analysis through application of a set of rules.
Eachrule corresponds to the most frequent correlation be-tween a syntactic phrase and a part of the event struc-ture.
Some of the rules are general, but others depend onthe lemma.
In the current version, lemmas are classifiedinto six different groups:1.
Standard-Type.
The rules are consistent withmost of the lemmas.
By way of illustration,these rules transform the subject (SUBJ) of asentence, which corresponds to an action, intothe agent, and the direct object (DO) into thepatient.
If the event type is a state, the SUBJwill be the first argument of the state and theattribute will be the second argument.
There isa subset of rules for passive sentences.2.
First-Type-Actions.
The rules transform theindirect object (IO) into the patient.
For in-stance, ?pegar?
(to hit).3.
Second-Type-Actions.
The IO is transformedinto the first argument of the states.
For in-stance, ?devolver?
(to give back ).4.
Third-Type-Actions.
The DO is transformedinto the second argument of the states.
For in-stance, ?otorgar?
(to grant).5.
First-Type-States.
The IO is transformed withthe second argument of the states.
For in-stance, ?gustar?
(to like).6.
Second-Type-States.
The second argument ofthe state is a prepositional phrase.
For in-stance, ?coincidir con?
(to coincide with).3.3 References and variables.Lemmas of complex events (specifically actions) areclassified additionally depending on their references.References are used in SESCO in order to link thearguments of an event with their functions in thearguments of sub-events.
As we have seen in section2.2, SESCO is based on a compositional semantictheory  where actions and processes are made up of sub-events.
These references are determined in the case ofactions by five different types of lemmas.Those parts of the event structure which have nocorrespondence with a phrase (for instance, the agent ina sentence without explicit SUBJ) are filled with vari-ables by the program.3.4 Unknown lemmas.As mentioned, the method requires a database with pre-vious examples, something which is not available for allthe potential lemmas of a language.
In case the programcould not reach a model for a lemma, it prompts the userfor the most basic information and tries to carry out theanalysis.
By this means, the final file contains all thesentences in SESCO format with the most likely struc-ture.Since SESCO has a DTD-controlled tagset cover-ing all possible analysis, the output file will always be awell formed and valid XML file.3.5 Revision.The last step is a manual revision of the output file.
Aswe have used the tagging of the UAM SpanishTreebank in order to develop our system, this step has agreat importance.The program errors detected during the analisyshave served us to implement new rules.
That is why thecorpus has been tagged in small groups of sentences(with approx.
100 sentences each group).When an error is detected during the analysis,typically a new rule is added.
For this reason,  thecorpus has been tagged in small groups of sentences(with approx.
100 sentences each group).
Thus, we haveperformed sixteen re-examinations of our system eachtime re-testing the reliability of the rules.Once the revision is completed, the new sentencesare added to the SDB.4 Main problems for SST.The last step of the SST process, the revision, providesus with a typology of problems in the automatic part ofthe system.
Let us look at the four most important typesand at the number of errors in the 1666 sentences:TotalsentencesMissinglemmasVerbTypeFalseAnalysisTreebankerrorsTotal1666 69 71 66 53 259100% 4.14% 4.26% 4% 3.18% 15.58%Table 2.
Error typology1.
Sentences without lemmas (69 errors).Newspapers have a lot of sentences (wordsbetween dots) which do not have a verb.Nominalization is frequently used by jour-nalists with pragmatic functions.
Takinginto account that we are analysing argu-ment structures of verbs, this sentenceserves to illustrate this error: ?Medidasdesesperadas en China para frenar lacrecida del Yangtz?
en la provincia deHubei.?
(?Tough measures in China tostop the Yangzte overflow in Hubei?).2.
Verb Type (71 errors).
The analysis of theverb is not correct because it is not in itsright group (see section 3.2.).
When theSST program does not recognize a lemma,it asks for the essential information, but itdoes not ask for types of references.3.
False analysis (66 errors).
The most likelyanalysis (according to the SDB) does notcorrespond to the sentence.
Since we arestill developing SESCO, it would be na?veto suppose that all these errors are due toSST problems.
As we have seen, the SDBis based on a small corpus of 49500 wordsand they are not enough to get the mostlikely structure of some verbs (some ofwhich have appeared only once or havenot appeared at all).4.
Treebank errors (53 errors).
We began ourwork with the last 100 sentences of theUAM Spanish Treebank (sentences 1500-1600).
We have done it in this inverse or-der because Manuel Alc?ntara had anno-tated himself the last sentences of theTreebank.
In this process, we have noticeddifferences between the analysis of thesentences.
These differences, even thoughthey are not important for the syntacticanalysis, have hindered the SST processsince our program expects a particularstructure.
With the help of SST, we nowhave a revised version of the syntacticTreebank.In addition to these errors, there are others whichwe have not considered so important because they donot change the event type.The rules for the indirect relations (those phraseswhich are not arguments of the verb) depend on thesemantic features of the Treebank tagset and they arenot always enough to determine the right tag.
It is worthremembering that both systems (Treebank and SESCO)are designed independently.Telicity of events is determined by the (indefi-nite/definite) articles of the phrases.
When the head of aphrase is not at the very beginning, errors can occur.5 Examples.Let us point out an uncomplicated example of the SSTprocess: ?EEUU tiene ya pistas sobre el doble atentadoen Kenia y Tanzania  .?
(?The United States already hasa lead about the terrorist outrage of Kenya and Tanza-nia?
).First of all, SST searches for the main verb and itslemma.
In this case, the verb is ?tiene?
(has) and thelemma is ?tener?
(to have).
The Treebank tag for thisverb is:<V Lemma="tener" Tensed="Yes" Form="PRES"Mode="IND" Number="SG" P="3">tiene</V>From this starting-point, SST looks for the mostlikely structure of ?tener?
in the SDB.
99.5% of ?tener?events are attributive states with a possessor and a prop-erty.The program checks if ?tener?
belongs to a specialverb type.
It does not, so the program checks if it is anormal sentence (it is not in passive voice) and followsthe standard rules.
These rules are the following:1.
The subject of the sentence (?EEUU?)
is thepossessor.2.
If there is an attributive phrase or a direct object,it is the property.
If there is not, the programlooks for other possibilities (oblique comple-ment, predicative complement, clauses andprepositional phrases).
In our example, ?pistassobre el doble atentado en Kenia y Tanzania?
istagged as direct object.3.
In case no possessor or property was found, SSTwould assign a variable to these arguments.4.
The program checks if the arguments are defi-nite or indefinite.
?Pistas?
is  indefinite andSST sets the event as indefinite.5.
Finally, SST looks for indirect relations (prepo-sitional phrases which are not arguments).Once these rules are applied, the program deter-mines if it is a negative sentence, a question, etc.
bymeans of looking for negative words and punctuation,and sets the appropriate features.
It also determines thetense.At the end, the final version of the sentence analysis iswritten in a target file following the SESCO format.To take a more difficult example, let us analyze thesentence ?Se ha escapado de casa?
(?He/she has escapedfrom his/her home?).
We have only one previous analy-sis of the lemma ?escaparse?
(to escape) in SDB and itis an action made up of a displacement.Regarding references, ?Escaparse?
belongs in a par-ticular group of events together with ?ir?, ?irrumpir?,?marchar?, ?presentarse?, etc.
For this group, the agentand patient of the action and the first argument of thedisplacement?s states are the same entity.The SST checks if it is a normal sentence and fol-lows the fitting rules for this group:1.
The subject of the sentence will be the agent.
Inthis case, there is no subject and the programestablishes a variable (X) chosen arbitrarily.2.
Because it is a displacement, SST looks forprepositional phrases with ?de?
or ?desde?(?from?)
in order to fill the second argument ofthe first state.
It finds ?de casa?.3.
SST looks for prepositional phrases with ?a?
or?hasta?
(?to?)
in order to fill the second argu-ment of the second state.
It does not find it.4.
The program establishes a number as identifierof the agent and links it together with the pa-tient and the first arguments of the states.5.
SST looks for indirect relations.At last, the program determines that it is not a nega-tive sentence and gets time and mood information.The annotated sentence in Treebank and SESCOformats can be found in appendix.
Most important datais underlined.6 Future work.Once we have the UAM Spanish Treebank semanticallyannotated, we would like to compare the data from bothspontaneous speech and written corpora.In a first comparison, we found that actions are themost frequent event type in our written corpus whilestates are the most frequent in the spoken one.states processes actionstotal 871 220 1139Written cor-pus % 39.1% 9.9% 51.1 %total 3939 478 2113Spoken cor-pus        % 60.3% 7.3% 32.4%Table 3 Event type comparisonIn addition, we are trying to carry out a reverse SSTprocess for achieving a syntactic tagging based on oursemantic schemes.
On the first stage, we have addedmorphological information (POS and grammar featuresas genre, number, etc.)
to our SESCO corpora.
We wantto explore this and other features in future work.ReferencesAlc?ntara, Manuel.
