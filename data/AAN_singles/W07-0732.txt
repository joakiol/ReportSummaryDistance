(SPE) system.
We documentqualitative analysis on two experimentsperformed in the shared task of the ACL2007 Workshop on Statistical MachineTranslation.
Comparative results and moreintegrated ?hybrid?
techniques are dis-cussed.1 IntroductionThe evolution of SYSTRAN?s architecture overthe last years has been to ?
open ?
the system toenable interaction between the internal system?srules and the external input ?
see Senellart (2003),Attnas et al (2005).
Based on this architecture,several directions are explored to introduce the useof ?
corpus-based ?
approaches at several levels ofthe process:- use of corpus-based tools to validate and enrichlinguistic resources (detection of forbidden se-quences, bilingual terminology extraction), - auto-matic recognition of the text domain, - use of acorpus-based decision mechanism within ?
wordboundary ?
(Chinese word identification), disam-biguation?
- use of word sense disambiguationtechniques ?
and the use of a  language model inthe generation phase to select alternative transla-tions, prepositions, and local reordering (adjectivepositioning).These tools have been presented in Senellart(2006) and most of them will be integrated inSYSTRAN version 7 systems.Independently, two experiments were carriedout for the shared task of the ACL 2007 Workshopon Statistical Machine Translation to combine araw SYSTRAN system with a statistical post-editing (SPE) system.
One experiment was run byNRC using the language pair English<>French inthe context of ?
Automatic Post-Edition ?
systemsusing the PORTAGE system as described in Si-mard et al (2007).
The second experiment basedon the same principle was run on the Ger-man>English and Spanish>English1 language pairsusing the Moses system (Koehn et al 2007).
Theobjective was to train a SMT system on a parallelcorpus composed of SYSTRAN translations withthe referenced source aligned with its referencedtranslation.Beyond both (a) the huge (and expected) im-provement of the BLEU score for the combinedsystem compared to raw translation output (forGerman-English, around 10 BLEU points for theEuroparl test set of WMT2007) and (b) the (ex-pected) corresponding improvement of the transla-tion fluency, we provide qualitative analysis on thecontributions (positive and negative) of the SPElayer imposed on the SYSTRAN translation outputin this paper.
For this analysis we classifiy the dif-ferent types of ?post-editing?
changes and pointout the alternative isolated statistical componentsthat could achieve the same results.We conclude with two possible approaches:breaking down the ?statistical layer?
into differentcomponents/tools each specialized in a narrow andaccurate area, or refining this global SPE approachin order to introduce linguistic constraints.1The Moses model was trained following the recom-mendations for the baseline system of WMT 2007.2202 The SYSTRAN SystemCovering 80 language pairs for 22 different sourcelanguages, SYSTRAN powers almost all majorportals (Google, Yahoo!, BabelFish, Apple,Worldlingo, ?)
with machine translation servicesthrough URL translations or translation ?boxes?
(estimated traffic: over 40 million sentence transla-tions and over 10 million web page translations perday).Customized systems are used by corporate custom-ers either within a post-editing workflow, or with-out post-editing for the translation of technicalKnowledge Bases.SYSTRAN engines are also available as desktopapplications through ?plugins?
or within post-editing tools.
The same engines are also availableon ultra-light architectures such as for PDA de-vices.The SYSTRAN system is traditionally classi-fied as a ?rule-based?
system and its design ?which has been in constant evolution - has, overthe years, always been driven by pragmatic consid-erations ?
progressively integrating most of theavailable productive techniques.
As such, it is dif-ficult to classify SYSTRAN and simply describeits architecture.
However, the evolution of theSYSTRAN system is governed by the followingprinciples:?
provide a deterministic output : it is possi-ble to easily explain the translation resultsfor a specific sentence and change the rule?
incremental translation quality: the moreimportant evaluation criterion for maturesystems is to perform a comparative evalua-tion of translation output between two con-secutive versions.
Since it is impossible toguarantee 0 regressions in linguistic devel-opment, 8 improvements for 1 degradationdefines the acceptance criterion for a lin-guistic patch.Crucial components of the SYSTRAN systemare the linguistic resources for each lan-guage/language pair ranging from 100k to 800kentries.
Such ?entries?
should be understood asboth simple or multiword ?lexical entries?
but alsoas customized  disambiguation rules.In this context (continuous integration of newtechniques in SYSTRAN engines, adhering to de-terminism and incrementability), over the last threeyears one major evolution within SYSTRAN hasbeen to make use of available corpora - staticallythrough extraction/learning/validation tools such as:?
Dictionary improvement using a monolin-gual corpus: new terms/entities/terminologyextraction (n-grams based on linguistic pat-terns);and dynamically through corpus-based decisionalgorithms such as:?
Word sense disambiguation?
Use of a language model to select alterna-tive translations, determiner choice, and lo-cal controlled reordering ?
like multiple ad-jective sequences.In the following section, we present a qualitativereview of the SYSTRAN+SPE output and analyzehow the different contributions relate to each spe-cific effort.3 Experimental Results & LinguisticEvaluationBased on the data from these two experiments:SYSTRAN+PORTAGE (En<>Fr), andSYSTRAN+Moses (De>En, Es>En), weperformed linguistic evaluations on the differencesbetween raw SYSTRAN output andSYSTRAN+SPE output.
The evaluation forEn<>Fr was performed on the News Commentarytest 2006 corpus, while the evaluations for De>En,and Es>En were performed on the Europarl test2007 corpus.3.1 ImpactThe first observation is the impact of the SPE onthe SYSTRAN output.
Table 1 displays the WCR(Word Change Rate2) and the ratio of sentencesimpacted by the statistical post-editing.
It is inter-esting to note that the impact is quite high sincealmost all sentences were post-edited.
On the otherhand, the WCR of SYSTRAN+SPE is relativelysmall ?
as this clearly relates to post-editing andnot a complete reshuffling of the translation.
Thesame insight is reinforced when reviewing a com-parator (see Table 2) ?
the SYSTRAN+SPE output2Word Change Rate is computed similarly to the WordError Rate, with regard to the SYSTRAN output.221is ?reasonably?
close to the raw SYSTRAN output,and the SPE output structure is completely basedon the SYSTRAN output.WordChangeRateImpact (ratio ofsentences impacted)SYSTRAN+PORTAGEEn>Fr (nc devtest 2006)0.33 98%SYSTRAN+PORTAGEFr>En (nc devtest 2006)0.23 95%SYSTRAN+MosesDe>En (nc test 2007)0.35 100%SYSTRAN+Moses Es>En (nctest 2007)0.31 99%Table 1 - Impact of SPE on raw translation outputSource:En>Fr,De>En,Es>enSYSTRAN SYSTRAN +SPEMonetary policycan be used tostimulate an econ-omy just as muchas fiscal policy, ifnot more, in elec-tion years, whichpoliticians willalways want to do.La politique mon?tairepeut ?tre employ?epour stimuler une?conomie justecomme beaucoup quela politique fiscale,sinon plus, en ann?esd'?lection, que lespoliticiens voudronttoujours faire.La politique mon?tairepeut ?tre utilis?e pourstimuler l'?conomie,tout comme la politiquefiscale, pour ne pasdire plus, dans lesann?es d'?lection, queles hommes politiquesvoudront toujours faire.Fortschritte der 12Bewerberl?nderauf dem Weg zumBeitrittProgress of the 12applicant countries onthe way to the entryProgress of the 12candidate countriesalong the road to ac-cessionEn una perspectivaa m?s largo plazo,habr?

As is, this basic integration does not meetthe acceptance criterion ?8 improv.
for 1 de-grad.??
The most improved category is the?termchg?
which corresponds to a localchoice of word sense or alternativetranslation of words and locutions.
In thiscategory, the main source degradation stemsfrom the ?termchg_mean?
category.
Thiscategory covers changes of lexical unit partsof speech.?
In grammatical categories, productivecategories are ?gram_det?
and ?gram_prep?but the improvement/degradation ratio forthis last category is very low (it showsglobal improvements but there are manyunacceptable degradations).?
As expected, no ?long-distance?
restruc-turing is observed and local reordering isnegative for En>Fr and relatively negligiblefor other language pairs.?
For the French target, morphology is a ma-jor issue (accounts for 25% of degradations).This was also expected since no mechanismin the SPE provides any control over themorphology.4 ConclusionsThe SYSTRAN+SPE experiments demonstratevery good results ?
both on automatic scoring andon linguistic analysis.
Detailed comparative analy-sis provides directions on how to further improvethese results by adding ?linguistic control?
mecha-nisms.
For SPE, we would, for instance, add lin-guistic constraints in the decoding process, know-ing that the structure/linguistic information couldbe made available in the translation output.Beyond the scope of these experiments, our re-sults set a baseline to compare with other moresophisticated/integrated ?rules and statistics?
com-bination models.In particular, the most improved categories ob-served in these experiments confirm that our cur-rent development direction for integrating data-driven mechanisms within translation engines (es-pecially for word sense disambiguation, for theselection of alternative translations or for specificlocal phenomena like determination) should con-verge on the same results while preventing associ-ated degradations.
Also, the high score reached bythe ?termchg_loc?
category substantiates the needto continue exploiting phrase tables built onparallel corpora to learn new terminology.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Michel Simard, RolandKuhn, George Foster and Pierre Isabelle from NRC,Canada for their collaboration on this work (Si-mard et al 2007).ReferencesAttn?s (M.), Senellart (P.) and Senellart (J.).
