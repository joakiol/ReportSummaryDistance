Thesystem is one of the deliverables of athree-year project aiming at establish-ing an international standard for languageresources which is applicable to Asianlanguages.
Our important contributionsto ISO 24613, standard Lexical MarkupFramework (LMF) include its robustnessto deal with Asian languages, and its ap-plicability to cross-lingual query tasks, asillustrated by the prototype introduced inthis paper.1 IntroductionDuring the last two decades corpus-based ap-proaches have come to the forefront of NLP re-search.
Since without corpora there can be nocorpus-based research, the creation of such lan-guage resources has also necessarily advancedas well, in a mutually beneficial synergetic re-lationship.
One of the advantages of corpus-based approaches is that the techniques usedare less language specific than classical rule-based approaches where a human analyses thebehaviour of target languages and constructsrules manually.
This naturally led the wayfor international resource standardisation, and in-deed there is a long standing precedent in theWest for it.
The Human Language Technol-ogy (HLT) society in Europe has been particu-larly zealous in this regard, propelling the cre-ation of resource interoperability through a se-ries of initiatives, namely EAGLES (Sanfilippo etal., 1999), PAROLE/SIMPLE (Lenci et al, 2000),ISLE/MILE (Ide et al, 2003), and LIRICS1.
These1http://lirics.loria.fr/continuous efforts have matured into activities inISO-TC37/SC42, which aims at making an inter-national standard for language resources.However, due to the great diversity of languagesthemselves and the differing degree of technolog-ical development for each, Asian languages, havereceived less attention for creating resources thantheir Western counterparts.
Thus, it has yet to bedetermined if corpus-based techniques developedfor well-computerised languages are applicable ona broader scale to all languages.
In order to effi-ciently develop Asian language resources, utilis-ing an international standard in this creation hassubstantial merits.We launched a three-year project to create aninternational standard for language resources thatincludes Asian languages.
We took the followingapproach in seeking this goal.?
Based on existing description frameworks,each research member tries to describe sev-eral lexical entries and find problems withthem.?
Through periodical meetings, we exchangeinformation about problems found and gen-eralise them to propose solutions.?
Through an implementation of an applicationsystem, we verify the effectiveness of the pro-posed framework.Below we summarise our significant contributionto an International Standard (ISO24613; LexicalMarkup Framework: LMF).1st year After considering many characteristicsof Asian languages, we elucidated the shortcom-ings of the LMF draft (ISO24613 Rev.9).
Thedraft lacks the following devices for Asian lan-guages.2http://www.tc37sc4.org/145(1) A mapping mechanism between syntacticand semantic arguments(2) Derivation (including reduplication)(3) Classifiers(4) Orthography(5) HonorificsAmong these, we proposed solutions for (1) and(2) to the ISO-TC37 SC4 working group.2nd year We proposed solutions for above the(2), (3) and (4) in the comments of the CommitteeDraft (ISO24613 Rev.

Our proposal was included in DIS(Draft International Standard).(2?)

representational issues with the richness ofwriting systems in Asian languages3rd year Since ISO 24613 was in the FDIS stageand fairly stable, we built sample lexicons in Chi-nese, English, Italian, Japanese, and Thai basedon ISO24613.
At the same time, we implementeda query expansion system utilising rich linguis-tic resources including lexicons described in theISO 24613 framework.
We confirmed that a sys-tem was feasible which worked on the tested lan-guages (including both Western and Asian lan-guages) when given lexicons compliant with theframework.
ISO 24613 (LMF) was approved bythe October 2008 ballot and published as ISO-24613:2008 on 17th November 2008.Since we have already reported our first 2 yearactivities elsewhere (Tokunaga and others, 2006;Tokunaga and others, 2008), we focus on theabove query expansion system in this paper.2 Query expansion usingLMF-compliant lexical resourcesWe evaluated the effectiveness of LMF on a mul-tilingual information retrieval system, particularlythe effectiveness for linguistically motivated queryexpansion.The linguistically motivated query expansionsystem aims to refine a user?s query by exploitingthe richer information contained within a lexicondescribed using the adapted LMF framework.
Ourlexicons are completely complaint with this inter-national standard.
For example, a user inputs akeyword ?ticket?
as a query.
Conventional queryexpansion techniques expand this keyword to aset of related words by using thesauri or ontolo-gies (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).
Usingthe framework proposed by this project, expand-ing the user?s query becomes a matter of followinglinks within the lexicon, from the source lexicalentry or entries through predicate-argument struc-tures to all relevant entries (Figure 1).
We focuson expanding the user inputted list of nouns to rel-evant verbs, but the reverse would also be possibleusing the same technique and the same lexicon.This link between entries is established throughthe semantic type of a given sense within a lexicalentry.
These semantic types are defined by higher-level ontologies, such as MILO or SIMPLE (Lenciet al, 2000) and are used in semantic predicatesthat take such semantic types as a restriction ar-gument.
Since senses for verbs contain a link toa semantic predicate, using this semantic type, thesystem can then find any/all entries within the lexi-con that have this semantic type as the value of therestriction feature of a semantic predicate for anyof their senses.
As a concrete example, let us con-tinue using the ?ticket?
scenario from above.
Thelexical entry for ?ticket?
might contain a semantictype definition something like in Figure 2.<LexicalEntry ...><feat att="POS" val="N"/><Lemma><feat att="writtenForm"val="ticket"/></Lemma><Sense ...><feat att="semanticType"val="ARTIFACT"/>...</Sense>...</LexicalEntry>Figure 2: Lexical entry for ?ticket?By referring to the lexicon, we can then deriveany actions and events that take the semantic type?ARTIFACT?
as an argument.First all semantic predicates are searched for ar-guments that have an appropriate restriction, inthis case ?ARTIFACT?
as shown in Figure 3, andthen any lexical entries that refer to these predi-cates are returned.
An equally similar definitionwould exist for ?buy?, ?find?
and so on.
Thus,by referring to the predicate-argument structure ofrelated verbs, we know that these verbs can take146<LexicalEntry ...><feat att="POS" val="Noun"/><Lemma><feat att="writtenForm" val="ticket"/></Lemma><Sense ...><feat att="semanticType" val="ARTIFACT"/>...</Sense>...</LexicalEntry>User Inputsticket<Sense><SemanticFeature>Semantic Features of type"restriction" that takeSense's semanticTypeAll senses formatched nouns<SemanticPredicateid="pred-sell-1"><SemanticArgument><feat att="label" val="X"/><feat att="semanticRole" val="Agent"/><feat att="restriction" val="Human"/></SemanticArgument>...<SemanticArgument><feat att="label" val="Z"/><feat att="semanticRole" val="Patient"/><feat att="restriction"val="ARTIFACT,LOCATION"/></SemanticArgument></SemanticPredicate>All Semantic Predicatesthat contain matchedSemantic Features<Sense>Senses that use matchedSemantic Predicates<LexicalEntry ...><feat att="POS" val="Verb"/><Lemma><feat att="writtenForm" val="sell"/></Lemma><Sense id="sell-1" ...>...<PredicativeRepresentationpredicate="pred-sell-1" ...></Sense></LexicalEntry><LexicalEntry><SemanticPredicate><LexicalEntry>System outputs"sell", ...For each <Sense> find all<SemanticArgument> thattake this semanticType asa feature of type"restriction"Find all verbs <LexicalEntry>that use these<SemanticPredicate>All verbs that havematched SensesFigure 1: QE Process Flow147<LexicalEntry ...><feat att="POS" val="V"/><Lemma><feat att="writtenForm"val="sell"/></Lemma><Sense id="sell-1" ...><feat att="semanticType"val="Transaction"/><PredicativeRepresentationpredicate="pred-sell-1"correspondences="map-sell1"></Sense></LexicalEntry><SemanticPredicate id="pred-sell-1"><SemanticArgument ...>...<feat att="restriction"val="ARTIFACT"/></SemanticArgument></SemanticPredicate>Figure 3: Lexical entry for ?sell?
with its semanticpredicate?ticket?
in the role of object.
The system then re-turns all relevant entries, here ?buy?, ?sell?
and?find?, in response to the user?s query.
Figure 1schematically shows this flow.3 A prototype system in detail3.1 OverviewTo test the efficacy of the LMF-compliant lexi-cal resources, we created a system implementingthe query expansion mechanism explained above.The system was developed in Java for its ?com-pile once, run anywhere?
portability and its high-availability of reusable off-the-shelf components.On top of Java 5, the system was developed us-ing JBoss Application Server 4.2.3, the latest stan-dard, stable version of the product at the time ofdevelopment.
To provide fast access times, andeasy traversal of relational data, a RDB was used.The most popular free open-source database wasselected, MySQL, to store all lexicons importedinto the system, and the system was accessed, as aweb-application, via any web browser.3.2 DatabaseThe finalised database schema is shown in Fig-ure 4.
It describes the relationships between en-tities, and more or less mirrors the classes foundwithin the adapted LMF framework, with mostlyonly minor exceptions where it was efficacious forquerying the data.
Due to space constraints, meta-data fields, such as creation time-stamps have beenleft out of this diagram.
Since the system also al-lows for multiple lexicons to co-exist, a lexicon idresides in every table.
This foreign key has beenhighlighted in a different color, but not connectedvia arrows to make the diagram easier to read.
Inaddition, though in actuality this foreign key is notrequired for all tables, it has been inserted as a con-venience for querying data more efficiently, evenwithin join tables (indicated in blue).
Having mul-tiple lexical resources co-existing within the samedatabase allows for several advantageous features,and will be described later.
Some tables also con-tain a text id, which stores the original id attributefor that element found within the XML.
This isnot used in the system itself, and is stored only forreference.3.3 System designAs mentioned above, the application is deployedto JBoss AS as an ear-file.
The system it-self is composed of java classes encapsulatingthe data contained within the database, a Pars-ing/Importing class for handling the LMF XMLfiles after they have been validated, and JSPs,which contain HTML, for displaying the inter-face to the user.
There are three main sectionsto the application: Search, Browse, and Config-ure.
Explaining last to first, the Configure section,shown in Figure 5, allows users to create a newlexicon within the system or append to an exist-ing lexicon by uploading a LMF XML file fromtheir web browser, or delete existing lexicons thatare no longer needed/used.
After import, the datamay be immediately queried upon with no otherchanges to system configuration, from within boththe Browse and Search sections.
Regardless oflanguage, the rich syntactic/semantic informationcontained within the lexicon is sufficient for car-rying out query expansion on its own.The Browse section (Figure 6) allows the user toselect any available lexicon to see the relationshipscontained within it, which contains tabs for view-ing all noun to verb connections, a list of nouns, alist of verbs, and a list of semantic types.
Each hasappropriate links allowing the user to easily jumpto a different tab of the system.
Clicking on a nountakes them to the Search section (Figure 7).
In thissection, the user may select many lexicons to per-form query extraction on, as is visible in Figure 7.148semantic_linkVARCHAR (64)sensesense_idPRIMARY KEYsynset_idFOREIGN KEYsyn_sem_correspondence_idFOREIGN KEYsemantic_predicate_idFOREIGN KEYsemantic_typeVARCHAR (64)lexicon_idFOREIGN KEYtext_idVARCHAR (64)lexicon_idFOREIGN KEYtext_idVARCHAR (100)semantic_predicate_idPRIMARY KEYsemantic_predicatelexicon_idFOREIGN KEYtext_idVARCHAR (64)semantic_argument_idPRIMARY KEYsemantic_argumentvalueVARCHAR (100)attributeVARCHAR (100)lexicon_idFOREIGN KEYsemantic_feature_idPRIMARY KEYsemantic_featurelexicon_idFOREIGN KEYsemantic_argument_idFOREIGN KEYsemantic_predicate_idFOREIGN KEYsemantic_predicate_to_argumentlexicon_idFOREIGN KEYsemantic_feature_idFOREIGN KEYsemantic_argument_idFOREIGN KEYsemantic_argument_to_featuredescriptionTEXTlexicon_idFOREIGN KEYtext_idVARCHAR (64)synset_idPRIMARY KEYsynsetwritten_formVARCHAR (64) NOT NULLpart_of_speechENUM( 'Verb', 'Noun' , 'Unknown')lexical_entrytext_idVARCHAR (64)entry_idPRIMARY KEYlexicon_idFOREIGN KEYsemantic_featureFOREIGN KEYsyntactic_featureFOREIGN KEYlexicon_idFOREIGN KEYargument_map_idPRIMARY KEYsyn_sem_argument_maplexicon_idFOREIGN KEYargument_map_idFOREIGN KEYsyn_sem_correspondence_idFOREIGN KEYsyn_sem_correspondence_to_maplexicon_idFOREIGN KEYtext_idVARCHAR (64)syn_sem_correspondence_idPRIMARY KEYsyn_sem_correspondencelexicon_idFOREIGN KEYsense_idFOREIGN KEYentry_idFOREIGN KEYlexical_entry_to_senselexicon_idFOREIGN KEYtext_idVARCHAR (100)frame_idPRIMARY KEYsubcat_framelexicon_idFOREIGN KEYframe_idFOREIGN KEYsense_idFOREIGN KEYentry_idFOREIGN KEYlexical_entry_to_subcat_framelexicon_idFOREIGN KEYtext_idVARCHAR (64)syntactic_argument_idPRIMARY KEYsyntactic_argumentvalueVARCHAR (100)attributeVARCHAR (100)lexicon_idFOREIGN KEYsyntactic_feature_idPRIMARY KEYsyntactic_featurelexicon_idFOREIGN KEYsyntactic_argument_idFOREIGN KEYframe_idFOREIGN KEYsubcat_frame_to_argumentlexicon_idFOREIGN KEYsyntactic_feature_idFOREIGN KEYsyntactic_argument_idFOREIGN KEYsyntactic_argument_to_featuredescriptionVARCHAR(128)languageVARCHAR(64)lexicon_idPRIMARY KEYlexiconrelation_typeVARCHAR (64)lexicon_idFOREIGN KEYrelated_sense_idFOREIGN KEYsense_idFOREIGN KEYsense_relationFigure 4: Database schemaFigure 5: QE System - Configure Figure 6: QE System - Browse149Figure 7: QE System - Search3.4 Semantic informationThis new type of query expansion requires richlexical information.
We augmented our data usingthe SIMPLE ontology for semantic types, usingthe same data for different languages.
This hadthe added benefit of allowing cross-language ex-pansion as a result.
In steps two and three of Fig-ure 1 when senses are retrieved that take specificsemantic types as arguments, this process can bedone across all (or as many as are selected) lex-icons in the database.
Thus, results such as areshown in Figure 7 are possible.
In this figure theJapanese word for ?nail?
is entered, and results forboth selected languages, Japanese and Italian, arereturned.
This feature requires the unification ofthe semantic type ontology strata.3.5 Possible extensionNext steps for the QE platform are to explore theuse of other information already defined within theadapted framework, specifically sense relations.Given to the small size of our sample lexicon, datasparsity is naturally an issue, but hopefully by ex-ploring and exploiting these sense relations prop-erly, the system may be able to further expand auser?s query to include a broader range of selec-tions using any additional semantic types belong-ing to these related senses.
The framework alsocontains information about the order in which syn-tactic arguments should be placed.
This informa-tion should be used to format the results from theuser?s query appropriately.4 An Additional EvaluationWe conducted some additional query expansionexperiments using a corpus that was acquired fromChinese LDC (No.
?2004-863-009?)
as a base (seebelow).
This corpus marked an initial achievementin building a multi-lingual parallel corpus for sup-porting development of cross-lingual NLP appli-cations catering to the Beijing 2008 Olympics.The corpus contains parallel texts in Chinese,English and Japanese and covers 5 domains thatare closely related to the Olympics: traveling, din-ing, sports, traffic and business.
The corpus con-sists of example sentences, typical dialogues andarticles from the Internet, as well as other languageteaching materials.
To deal with the different lan-guages in a uniform manner, we converted the cor-pus into our proposed LMF-compliant lexical re-sources framework, which allowed the system toexpand the query between all the languages withinthe converted resources without additional modifi-cations.As an example of how this IR system func-tioned, suppose that Mr. Smith will be visitingBeijing to see the Olympic games and wants toknow how to buy a newspaper.
Using this system,he would first enter the query ?newspaper?.
Forthis query, with the given corpus, the system re-turns 31 documents, fragments of the first 5 shownbelow.
(1) I?ll bring an English newspaper immediately.
(2) Would you please hand me the newspaper.
(3) There?s no use to go over the newspaper ads.
(4) Let?s consult the newspaper for such a film.
(5) I have little confidence in what the newspa-pers say.Yet it can be seen that the displayed results are notyet useful enough to know how to buy a newspa-per, though useful information may in fact be in-cluded within some of the 31 documents.
Usingthe lexical resources, the query expansion modulesuggests ?buy?, ?send?, ?get?, ?read?, and ?sell?as candidates to add for a revised query.Mr.
Smith wants to buy a newspaper, so he se-lects ?buy?
as the expansion term.
With this querythe system returns 11 documents, fragments of thefirst 5 listed below.
(6) I?d like some newspapers, please.150(7) Oh, we have a barber shop, a laundry, a store,telegram services, a newspaper stand, tabletennis, video games and so on.
(8) We can put an ad in the newspaper.
(9) Have you read about the Olympic Games ofTable Tennis in today?s newspaper, Miss?
(10) newspaper says we must be cautious abouttidal waves.This list shows improvement, as information aboutnewspapers and shopping is present, but still ap-pears to lack any documents directly related tohow to buy a newspaper.Using co-occurrence indexes, the IR systemreturns document (11) below, because the noun?newspaper?
and the verb ?buy?
appear in thesame sentence.
(11) You can make change at some stores, just buya newspaper or something.From this example it is apparent that this sortof query expansion is still too naive to apply toreal IR systems.
It should be noted, however, thatour current aim of evaluation was in confirmingthe advantage of LMF in dealing with multiplelanguages, for which we conducted a similar runwith Chinese and Japanese.
Results of these testsshowed that in following the LMF framework indescribing lexical resources, it was possibile todeal with all three languages without changing themechanics of the system at all.5 DiscussionLMF is, admittedly, a ?high-level?
specification,that is, an abstract model that needs to be fur-ther developed, adapted and specified by the lex-icon encoder.
LMF does not provide any off-the-shelf representation for a lexical resource; instead,it gives the basic structural components of a lexi-con, leaving full freedom for modeling the partic-ular features of a lexical resource.
One drawbackis that LMF provides only a specification manualwith a few examples.
Specifications are by nomeans instructions, exactly as XML specificationsare by no means instructions on how to representa particular type of data.Going from LMF specifications to a true instan-tiation of an LMF-compliant lexicon is a long way,and comprehensive, illustrative and detailed ex-amples for doing this are needed.
Our prototypesystem provides a good starting example for thisdirection.
LMF is often taken as a prescriptivedescription, and its examples taken as pre-definednormative examples to be used as coding guide-lines.
Controlled and careful examples of conver-sion to LMF-compliant formats are also needed toavoid too subjective an interpretation of the stan-dard.We believe that LMF will be a major basefor various SemanticWeb applications because itprovides interoperability across languages and di-rectly contributes to the applications themselves,such as multilingual translation, machine aidedtranslation and terminology access in different lan-guages.From the viewpoint of LMF, our prototypedemonstrates the adaptability of LMF to a rep-resentation of real-scale lexicons, thus promotingits adoption to a wider community.
This projectis one of the first test-beds for LMF (as one ofits drawbacks being that it has not been tested ona wide variety of lexicons), particularly relevantsince it is related to both Western and Asian lan-guage lexicons.
This project is a concrete attemptto specify an LMF-compliant XML format, testedfor representative and parsing efficiency, and toprovide guidelines for the implementation of anLMF-compliant format, thus contributing to thereduction of subjectivity in interpretation of stan-dards.From our viewpoint, LMF has provided a for-mat for exchange of information across differentlyconceived lexicons.
Thus LMF provides a stan-dardised format for relating them to other lexicalmodels, in a linguistically controlled way.
Thisseems an important and promising achievement inorder to move the sector forward.6 ConclusionThis paper described the results of a three-yearproject for creating an international standard forlanguage resources in cooperation with other ini-tiatives.
In particular, we focused on query expan-sion using the standard.Our main contribution can be summarised asfollows.?
We have contributed to ISO TC37/SC4 ac-tivities, by testing and ensuring the portabil-ity and applicability of LMF to the devel-opment of a description framework for NLPlexicons for Asian languages.
Our contribu-tion includes (1) a package for derivational151morphology, (2) the syntax-semantic inter-face with the problem of classifiers, and (3)representational issues with the richness ofwriting systems in Asian languages.
As ofOctober 2008, LMF including our contribu-tions has been approved as the internationalstandard ISO 26413.?
We discussed Data Categories necessaryfor Asian languages, and exemplified sev-eral Data Categories including reduplication,classifier, honorifics and orthography.
Wewill continue to harmonise our activity withthat of ISO TC37/SC4 TDG2 with respect toData Categories.?
We designed and implemented an evaluationplatform of our description framework.
Wefocused on linguistically motivated query ex-pansion module.
The system works with lexi-cons compliant with LMF and ontologies.
Itsmost significant feature is that the system candeal with any language as far as the those lex-icons are described according to LMF.
To ourknowledge, this is the first working systemadopting LMF.In this project, we mainly worked on threeAsian languages, Chinese, Japanese and Thai, ontop of the existing framework which was designedmainly for European languages.
We plan to dis-tribute our results to HLT societies of other Asianlanguages, requesting for their feedback throughvarious networks, such as the Asian language re-source committee network under Asian Federationof Natural Language Processing (AFNLP)3, andthe Asian Language Resource Network project4.We believe our efforts contribute to internationalactivities like ISO-TC37/SC45 (Francopoulo et al,2006).AcknowledgmentsThis research was carried out through financialsupport provided under the NEDO InternationalJoint Research Grant Program (NEDO Grant).ReferencesR.
