However ,  themetamorphos is  g rammars ,  as def ined byCo lmerauer  2 , have to spec i fy  s t r i c t ly  theorder  of te rmina l  and nontermina l  symbols .A modi f icat ion of P ro log  has been implemen-ted which a l lows "f loat ing te rmina ls"  to beincluded in a metamorphosis grammar  toge-ther with some information enabling to cori-trol the search for such a terminal in theunprocessed part of the input.
The modifica-tion is illustrated by several examples fromthe Polish language and some open questionsare discussed.Metamorphosis grammars  2' 3 make a con-venient tool of the formal description of syn-tax of natural languages.
Their convenienceis due to their straightforward relation tothe programming language Prolog.
A meta-morphosis grammar  is an ordinary part ofa Prolog program.
It defines a language aswell as a parser for it.We suggest here such modifications ofthe way  of handling the metamorphosis gram-mars in Prolog which allow these grammarsto analyse constructions without strictlyspecified order of their components.Let us consider an example.
The follo-wing sentence in Polish :( I )  PRACOWA(J BYLO BARDZO PRZYJEMNIE'to work' ' i t  was' "very \ 'nice ~"It was very nice to work.
"is accepted by the metamorphosis grammargiven below (nonterminals prefixed by % ,terminals by ~, == stands for an arrow) :%S == %INF %V %ADVP.%INF == gPRACOWAC.%V == ~BYLO.%ADVP = = ~B AR DZ O ~PR ZYJE M NIE.In o rder  to s impl i fy  the example we ne-g lect  the grammat ica l  ca tegor ies  of phrasesand words.
The last three rules serveas "dictionary rules".This grammar does not, however,account for many correct Polish sentences,such as :(2) BARDZO PRZYJEM~E BYLO PRACOWAd(3)  BYLO BARDZO PRZYJEMNIE  PRACOWAdTo make the grammar  accept  thesesentences  we should, for  example,  add tworules :%S == %ADVP %V NNF.%S == %V %ADVP %INF.One-third of the possible permutationsof words BYLO,  BARDZO,  PRACOWAC,PRZY\ ]EMNIE  constittzte admissible Polishsentences (although sometimes stylisticallymarked).
The complete grammar shouldthen have 21 rules, including dictionaryrules.
Such a solution is obviously clumsyand not sa t i s fac tory .Our f i r s t  p roposa l  cons is ts  in a l lo-wing two kinds of terminal symbols :ancho-red terminals, retrieved in the currentposition of a given sentence (available inmetamorphosis grammars  2 and prefixed Byin our example) and floating terminals,retrieved anywhere in the unprocessedpartof a sentence (we shall prefix them by ~ ).The easiest and most concise way  ofexpressing a grammar  for the sentencesmentioned above consists in replacing eve-ry anchored terminal by a floating termi-nal.
It is, however, not satisfactory beca-use such a grammar accepts also deviant(syntactically or stylistically) sequences,e.g.
(g )  BYLO BARDZO PRACOWAC PRZYJEMNIE(5)  PRZY JEMNIE  PRACOWAC BARDZO BYLOBy us ing both the anchored  termina ls  andthe floating terminals we  can define thefollowing grammar  :--346--%S == %IN.F %V %ADVP.%INF == @PRACOWAC.%V == @BYLO.%ADVP == ~BARDZO @PRZYJEMNIE .The grammar  accepts  only hal f  of theincor rect  sequences ,  but (a  usua l  t rade-o f f )it re jec ts  some cor rect  Po l i sh  sentences .I t  seems that only a grammar  withnumerous specific rules can satisfy thestrong requirement of accepting those andonly those sequences which are consideredcorrect and no others.The formalism is, however, quite ap-propriate to describe e.g.
the syntax ofsome noun phrases in Polish or syntacti-cally unbound modifiers.Introducing the floating terminalsinto the Marseille-originated Prolog inter-preter requires only minor alterations ofthe bootstrap.
The facility has been alre-ady made standard in the Prolog versionfor ODRAI$05 (ICL ~900 compatible)whichis distributed in Poland.To illustrate deficiencies of the pro-posed mechanism in parsing certain kindsof free word-order constructions we shallconsider the following Polish sentences:(6) TRZEBA BY  CZEGOg WII~C EJ'is needed" "something" "more"\[present, \[condi- \[genitive\]impersonal\] tionalformative\](7) CZEGOS BY WlRCE\] TRZEBA"Something more would be needed.
"The sentences (6),(7) consist of the~mpersonal conditional verb-like phraseTRZEBA BY  and the noun phrase CZEGO~WII~CEJ.
The words CZEGOS and WII~CE\]may occupy any position, but the order ofTRZEBA and BY  is restricted.
If BYprecedes TRZEBA then BY  must not bethe first word of a sentence, otherwise,BY  must be adjacent to TRZEBA.Therefore in order to make a conci-se grammar accepting all correct Polishsentences built of the words TRZEBA,  BY,WII~CEJ, CZEGO~,  we must introduce amore se lec t ive  in format ion concern ing  theorder  of words .
We supply se lec ted  te rmi -nals  and nonterminals with-control itemsrestricting their scopes of floating.
Thelack of such an item means the restric-lions inheriled from the left-hand nonter-minal (in particular no restrictions)..For example, such restrictions couldbe:a terminal should be the last (the firsl),a terminal must follow (immediately fol-low) the recently retrieved terminal.Coming back to our example weshould specify:either BY  follows a verb immediately,or BY  must not be the first and mustprecede a verb.We can now write the grammar accep-ting the sentences (6),(?).
The grammaris as follows (variable parameters prefixedby asterisks, control items separated bycommas ).%S (~TENSE,  ~MOOD ) ==%VPIMPER S (~TENSE,  ~MOOD ).%VPIM PER S (~TENSE,  ~M OOD ) = =%VIMPER S ( ~TENSE,  ~MOOD,  ~SYNTREQ)%REQ(~SYNTREQ) .%VIMPERS( ,~TENSE,  COND,  ~SYNTREQ)  ==%VERB( IMPERS,  ~TENSE,  ~SYNTREQ)@BY, NEXT.%VIMPERS (~TENSE,  COND,  ~SYNTREQ)  ==@BY, NOT.FIRST%VERB( IMPERS,  ~TENSE,  ~SYNTREQ) ,  AFTER.~VERB (IMPERS, PRESENT,  NP (GEN)) = =~TRZEBA.%REQ(NP(~CASE ) ) == %'NP(~CASE ).%NP( ,CASE)  == %NPRON( ,CASE)  %IviOD.%?~PRON(GEN) == @CZEGOS.%MOD == eWIECEJ .In order to make the example clearwe use only the categories relevant forthe sentences under discussion.
We omit,for instance, the number and gender of anoun phrase ; the parameter ~SYNTREQexpresses a single syntactic requirement(in general a verb can have more thenone requirement ; for details, seeSzpakowicz 5 ).
The rule for NP  is alsovery simplified.
.From the point of view ofthe description of Polish syntax the grmn-mar presented above is, in fact, unsophi-sticated and fragmentary.
It is sufficient,however, to illustrate some linguistic phe-nomena mentioned earlier.An experimental version of the ODRA-Prolog accepts the metamorphosis grammar--347--rules with control items (syntactically justProlog terms).
The inventory of the wordorder restrictions has yet to Be establishedby the research on word order in Polish.Thus, for the time Being, the interpreta-tion of the control items is implemented inan ad hoc manner.A formal description of the syntax ofa natural language of free word-order type,as for example Polish and other Slavoniclanguages, requires, however, some addi-tional technical and linguistic problems toBe solved.We want to present now those pro-blems which we find to Be the most impor-tant.In some cases the occurence of aword- fo rm depends on particular proper-ties of the word which immediately prece-des it (usually it is the phonetic shape ofthe preceding word which influences thechoice of the proper word-form ).
Forexample, agglutin,ative present tense formof the verb BYC in second person, singu-lar, masculine can Be realized either byor By E~.
The forms ~, EL  arewritten jointly with the preceding syntacticitem But on the level of syntactic descrip-tion they are clearly distinguishable.Let us illustrate this problem by thefollowing sentences :(8 )NAROBIL  + E~ LADNEGO"to cause" "cute"here : 'big"\[sg, masc\] \[2p, sg, \[sg, masc, \ [sg,masc,masc\] gen \] gen \](9) LADNEGO + S KLOPOTU NAROBIL"You've caused quite a lot of trouble.
"KLOPOTU/trouble"The very simple grammar presentedbelow accepts these two sentences but itaccepts also some incorrect  sequencesbecause the rules do not express thedependency phenomena mentioned above.%S == %PP(,GENDER , ~NUMBER , NP(GEN))%VPT(,~GENDER , ~NUMBER , ~PERSON, ~X)%NP(~NUMBER2, ~GENDER2,  GEN) .%VPT(MASC,  SING, 2P, VOW)  == @S.%VPT(MASC,  SING, 2P, CON)  == @ES.%PP(MASC, SING, NP(GEN ) ) == eNAROBIL.i%NP(SING, MASC, GEN) ==eLADNEGO @KLOPOTU, AFTER.
(VPT-  the abbreviated present tense formIof the verb BYC;  VOW and CON mean"used after a vowel" and "used after aconsonant" ) .So far we do not see the simple andsatisfactory way  of relating the parameter?
X of %VPT to the other words andphrases.
Provisionally the agreement ofthe agglutinative forms of the verb BYEwith the corresponding words may Be re-solved during dictionary lookup in thepre-parsing phase.The other purely linguistic problemsare related to influence of the free word-order on accomodating the verb phrase tothe gender of a compound noun phrase.For example, the verb phrases in the apo-sition agree in gender with the last consti-tuent of the noun phrase, as in:(i0) JAN m:B MARIA  PRZYSZL i'John' "or" "Mary ~ "came"If era\]Similarly, the gender of the verbphrase in the postposition may agree withthe first constituent of the noun phrase,for example :(II) PRZYSZEDL JAN LUB MARIA?
Ca lne  ~\[masc\]It is only recently that this difficultproblem has been a subject of a part ialresearch.
The formal syntax description ofwritten sentences in Polish with neutra\]word-order is availableS, 6.
It acceptspractically all nonelliptical declarative andnegative sentences, as well as the majorityof interrogative sentences, nevertheless,we can propose only a provisional solutionof this problem.Another complicated question consistsin the discontinuity of the phrases whichconstitute the sentence, as for exampleinterpenetration of the verb phrase and thenoun phrase :(12) NOW& K SlAZKE; INPIDAL JAN MARII IVPI'new" 'gave" 'Joh~ /book" "Mary"\[acc\] ~.nom\] \[acc\] \[dat \]"It is a new Book that  John gave to Mary",348Therefore the contro\] informationshould allow the search of missing consti-tuents of the phrases even far off themain component.
On the other hand itshould protect against "borrowing" an inap-propriate constituent from a quite differentphrase, e.g.
from the subordinate clause.It is now clearly visible that parsingfree word-order languages is really dif-ferent from the syntactic analysis of, say,English.
Although the presented modifica-tions of metamorphosis grammars do notsolve all the problems discussed above,they provide a useful instrument for furt-her experimental studies.Finally we want to emphasize that wewere aware of the semantic and pragmaticfunctions of free word-order, which arestudied e.g.
by Sgal!

Butwe believe that, from the methodologicalpoint of view, it is justified to prescindfrom them in the syntax description.A reader interested in some notions ofthe impact of word-order on semantico-pragmatic level, may wish to consultBiell I .ReferencesIll Biefi J.S.
