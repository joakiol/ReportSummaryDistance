In order to treat lexical issues systemati-cally in transfer-based MT systems, we introducethe concept of bilingual-sings which are defined bypairs of equivalent monolingual signs.
The bil-ingual signs not only relate the local linguisticstructures of two languages but also play a centralrole in connecting the linguistic processes of transla-tion with knowledge based inferences.
We alsoshow that they can be effectively used to formulateappropriate questions for disambiguating "transferambiguities", which is crucial in interactive MT sys-tems.1.
Introduction'Lexical Transfer' has always been one of themain sources of problems in Machine Translation(MT)\[Melby, 19861\[Nirenburg, 1988\].Research in transfer-based MT systems hasfocussed on discovering an appropriate l vel oflinguistic description for translation, at which wecan specify 'translation relations" (or transfer ules)in a simple manner.
However, lexical differencesbetween languages have caused problems in thisattempt.
Besides structural changes caused by lexi-cal Iransfer, selecting appropriate translations ofsource lexical items has been one of the hardestproblems in MT.Because languages have their own ways ofreflecting the structure of the world in their lexi-cons, and the process of lexicalization is more orless arbitrary, bilingual knowledge about lexicalcorrespondences is highly dependent on languagepairs and individual words.
We have to .prepare aframework in which such idiosyncratic bilingualknowledge about lexical items can be systemati-cally accumulated.Our approach in this paper follows the generaltrend in computational linguistics which emphasizesthe role of the lexicon in linguistic theory.
In partic-ular, our idea of bilingual signs shares a commonintuition with \[Beaven, 1988\] and \[Whitelock,1988\].
As with their proposal, we too specify localstructural correspondences b tween two languages inbilingual exicons.Unlike former approaches, however, we expli-citly define bilingual signs and use them as predi.cates in logical formulae (bilingual pivot expres-sions).
Bilingual signs in our framework not onlylink the local linguistic structures of two languageswhere the corresponding two monolingual signsappear, but also, by behaving as logical predicates,they connect linguistic-based processes in MT withinference processes.
Complicated structuralChanges, which are often required in translation ofremote language pairs like English and Japanese, arecaptured by logical inferences \[Tsujii, 1990\].The framework has the following advantagesover conventional methods.
(i) Reversibility of bilingual dictionaries (lexicaltransfer rules)(ii) Natural interfaces between knowledge-based(inference) processes and MT(iii) Ease of paraphrasing using different words(see section 6)2.
Bilingual signs as logical predicates and theirdefinitionThe basic idea of bilingual signs is simple.instead of using predicates corresponding directly tosurface words, we use bilingual pairs of lexicalitems as predicates.
That is, we use\[RUN:JIKKOOSURU\] and \[RUN:UN'EISURU\] asbasic predicates expressing the meanings of run inthe following sentences.
(1) The teacher runs the program.
(2) The teacher runs the company.Corresponding to the obvious meaningdifference of run in (1) and (2), we have to usedifferent surface verbs in Japanese, "jikkoosuru" for(1) and "un'eisuru" for (2).
The bilingual sign\[RUN:JIKKOOSURU\] is a predicate whichexpresses the truth condition which an event shouldsatisfy in order to be described by run in Englishand jikkoosuru in Japanese.
Note that\[RUN:JIKKOOSURU\] expresses not only onedisambiguated sense of run but also one disambi-- 275 -guated sense of the Japanese verb j ikkoosuru I.Our system is a conventional transfer basedMT system where the monolingual analysis andtransfer phases are executed separately.
Theanalysis phase of English produces the followingschema of logical formulae (3) as the description of(1).
(For simplicity, we ignore articles, quantifiers,etc .
)(3) {\[RUN:?I\](e) & ARGI(e,x) & ARG2(e,y)& \[TEACHER:?2\](x) & \[PROGRAM:?3\](y)}(3) is not a logical formula in the ordinary sense buta schema which represents a set of possible formu-lae.
\[RUN:?I\] is a predicate schema, and by bind-ing the variable '?1' to a specific Japanese verb, weget a specific predicate such as\[RUN:JIKKOOSURU\], \[RUN:UN'EISURU\], etc.The transfer phase is taken to be a phase whichidentifies appropriate predicates in a schema of logi-cal formulae produced by the analysis phase.As in LFG \[Kaplan, 1982\], we assume thatsemantic representations (logical forms) are relatedlexically with a certain level of linguistic descrip-tions.
Because a bilingual sign is defined by twolanguages (here English and Japanese), the two rela-tionships of (logical form <----> English) and (logicalform ~ > Japanese) are specified in the same place.In order to avoid further complications caused bychanges of grammatical functions (passive construc-tions, etc.
), we use thematic role representations aslinguistic descriptions in the definitions of bilingualsigns.The following definition shows the predicate\[RUN:UN'EISURU\] has arity two (argl and arg2)and the arguments have sortal restrictions.
(4) (Def-Pred \[RUN:UN'EISURU\]{argl := \[HUMAN:NINGEIq\] v\[ORGANIZATION:SOSHIKI\],arg2 := \[ORGANIZATION:SOSHIKI\],eng := {head := {e-lex :-- run},agt := <\[ argl>,obj := <!
arg2>},jpn := \[head := {j-lex := un'eisuru},agt := <\[ argl>,obj := <!
arg2>}} )2This example is rather simple, since locallinguistic structures in both languages are the same.That is, the agent and the object in Englishcorrespond to the constituents with the same1 jikkoosuru can be translated into several English verbsincluding run, carry out.
execute, implement, practice, etc.2 Angle brackets '< >' show a path description andexclamation-mark 'I ' in the angle brackets means the smal-lest description block (shown by braces '{ }') which con-tains the description block in which the '1' appears.thematic roles.
Note that these correspondences areexpressed through argl and arg2 of the definedpredicate.
However, many cases have been observed, where lexical transfer causes tructural changes.
It',is also the ease that objects or events describable by~single words in one language are described byphrases or clauses in other languages ( ee section 3).We may expect hat classes of objects/eventswhich can be expressed by single words in onelanguage correspond to natural classes ofobjects/events, he classes whose truth conditions arenaturally captured by single predicates in logicalforms.
Therefore, we prepare single bilingual signsfor expressing their truth conditions if at least oneof the languages has lexical items \[Emele, 1990\].That is, we define a single bilingual sign whichcorresponds to a complex linguistic object in onelanguage, if the other language xpresses the same"meaning" by a single word.As \[Sadler, 1990\] pointed out, compared withother methods using arbitrary predicates in meaningrepresentation, our method is well-motivated inselecting basic predicates.
In fact, the requiredfineness of distinction of word senses dependshighly on the target language (source words aretranslationally ambiguous \[Tsujii, 1988\]).
We canexpect the set of bilingually defined predicates tohave appropriate, at least necessary if not sufficient,granularity of the semantic domains for translationof the two given languages.Furthermore, we can use logical formulae tospecify mutual relationships among bilingual signs,which means that we can specify explicitly 'logical'relationships among iexical transfer ules (see sec-tion 4).3.
Complex structural changes - complex bil-ingual signsThe following show how our framework treatsstructural changes caused by lexical correspon-dences.\[A\] Case changesThe English sentence 'l like him.'
is usuallytranslated into 'll me plaft.'
in French.
(5) (Def-Pred \[LIKE:PLAIRE\]{argl "- *~ targ2 "-eng := {head := {e-lex := like},agt := <!
argl>,obj := <t arg2>},fre := \[head := {f-lex := plalre},agt := <!
arg2>,obj := <t argl>} )In our framework, corresponding case elements inthe two languages are linked with each otherthrough the same argument names of bilingual signs.- 276 -\[B\] Lexical inclusions of argumentsA Japanese verb nuru, for example, istranslated as paint, varnish, spread Coread withbutter), apply (paint) etc., depending on the materialbeing applied.
Some of the English verbs (paint,varnish, etc.)
include the objects (of the Japanese) intheir meaning.
For example, the structural changebetween (6a) and (6b) is treated by the definition(7).
(6a) kabe-ni penki-wo nuru\[n:wail-loeation\] \[n:paint-object\] \[v\](6b) (someone) paints the wall.Iv\] : \[object\](7) (Def-Pred \[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\]{argl :=,arg2 :=,eng := {head := {e-lex := paint} },agt := <~ argl>,obj := <l arg2>},jpn := {head := {j-lex := nuru},agt := <!
argl>,obj := {head := {j-lex := penki}},loc := <!
arg2>} )Note that the Japanese verb nuru governs threedependents but one of them is in this definitionfilled in advance by a specific noun (penki -paintin English).
The definition shows that the phrasepenki-wo nuru in Japanese corresponds to theEnglish paint and that this correspondence d fines apredicate as a basic unit of semantic representation.\[C\] Head switchingOne of the well-known examples is thecorrespondence between the English verb like andthe Dutch adverb graag (which roughly correspondsto pleasantly in English).
The same!
kind ofphenomena has often been observed in itranslationbetween English and Japanese.The event expressed by the verb manage Onthe usage of manage to do something) is capturedby an adverb nantoka ('somehow or other' or 'withgreat effort' in English) in Japanese.
The adverb isused to modify the event expressed as an infinitiveclause in English.The correspondence b tween (8a) and (Sb) iscaptured by the definition (9).
(Sa) watashi-ga nantoka\[n:I-subject\] \[adv:somehow r other\]ronbun-wo shiage -ta\[n:paper-object\] \[v:complete\] \[tense:past\](8b) I managed to complete {the/a} paper.
(9) (Def-Pred \[MANAGE:NANTOKA\]{argl "- ,m ?
,arg2 := \[eVenrdekigoto\],eng := {head := {e-lex := manage},agt := <!
argl>,evt := <!
arg2>},jpn := {<I arg2>,agt := <l argl>,lady := {head := {j-lex := nantoka}  } })3In this example, though the adverb nanwka is notthe head of the Japanese deep case description('jpn'), it is converted into the predicate\[MANAGE:NANTOKA\] in the logical formula, andthe rest of the 'jpn' description into arg2.\[Kaplan,: 1989\] proposed two ways of treatingsuch head-switching phenomena, one monolingualand the other bilingual.
Our treatment in this paperis basically bilingual in the sense that the non-headconstruction in Japanese is directly related with theEnglish construction in which the corresponding ele-ment is expressed as the head.
However?
if we deemthe logical level of representation a separate, moreabstract but mono-lingual evel of representation,then our method is quite close to the mono-lingualtreatment suggested by \[Zajac, 1990\].
Our conten-tion is that suoh an abstract level of representation ishard to justify by purely mono-lingual considera-tions but only possible by bilingual (or multi-lingual) considerations.4.
Definition o f  sort hierarchiesSort-subsort relationships among object-sortssuch as '\[TEACHER:SENSEI\] is a\[HUMAN:NINGEN\]', etc.
are expressed in conven-tional logic by implications.
However, logical impli-cations expreSs various ontologically different rela-tionships amoiig formulae, which have to be treateddifferently in translation.
Sortal relationships uchas these are of special importance in translation,because they l give alternative linguistic means ofdescribing the same events/objects (a supersort givesa more vague, less specific description than thesubsort).
We explicitly indicate that a given implica-tion expresses a sortal relationship, as follows.3 We introduce a new notation.
'{<1 arg2>,'/adv :={...}}' means that the evenffobject described by rids wholedescription block minus 'adv:={...)' corresponds to the arg2of the description block immediately above, and '/adv:={...}'is convened into a predicate atthe logical level Note thatour treatment of 'nentoka' is essentially the same as thetreatment of 'gnta 8' in the MiMe2 formalism \[van Noord,1990\] m that it has the same defect.
That h, it cannot copewith cases where more than two words which require 'rais-ing' like 'nantcka' occur at the same level.- 277 -(Sort-subsort elationships of event-sorts can also bedefined in the same manner).
(10) (-> SUB:\[TEACHER:SENSEI\](x)SUP: \[HUMAN:NINGEN\] (x)).
('->' means logical implication)(10) shows that, if x is describable by teacher (orsensei in Japanese), the same object can bedescribed by a less accurate word like human.
Wedeem the process of selecting an appropriate targetexpression among possible candidates as the processof locating a expression with the appropriate vague-ness level.The English verb wear is a well-known exam-ple of a translationaUy ambiguous word when it istranslated into Japanese.
It can be translated intoseveral different verbs including haku ('wearshoes'), kaburu ('wear a hat'), kakeru ('wear specta-cles'), kiru ('wear clothes'), etc., depending on whatis worn.
While we have a complex expression mini-tsukeru (mi - body, ni particle, tsukeru - put on) inJapanese which preserves almost the same vague-ness as wear, to use this as the translation of wearleads to an awkward translation if the material to beworn belongs to a specific sort.
kutsu(shoes)-womini-tsukeru, for example, tends to be understoodas "the shoes are worn on a non-standard of thebody (not on the fee0".The predicate \[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUKERU\] canbe defined in a way similar to \[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\] in (7).
(11) (Def-Pred \[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUKERU\]{argl := \[HUMAN:NINGEN\],arg2 :=,eng := {head := {e-lex := wear},agt := <I argl>,obj := <!
arg2>};jpn := {head := {j-lex := tsukeru},agt := <!
argl>,obj := <!
arg2>,loc := {head := {j-lex := mi} } } })The sort-subsort elations between \[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUKERU\] and \[WEAR:HAKU\] can be defined asfollows.
(12) (<->>SUB:\[WEAR:HAKU\]SUP: \[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUKERU\]CON:ARG2(self, x) & \[SHOES:KUTSU\](x)).The schema (12) which is specified by '<->>'expresses that(i) \[WEAR:HAKU\] is a subsort of \[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUKERU\],(ii) if an event - se l f -  belongs to the sort\[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUKERU\] and if theargument-2 of the event belongs to the sort\[SHOES:KUTSU\], then the event also belongsto \[WEAR:HAKU\].All the event-sorts related with wear in theabove have the same argument structure (arity androle).
But this continuity of argument structuresthrough sorts is not necessarily guaranteed.
A sortcan have multiple supersorts and so the continuityof argument structures from different supersorts mayconflict with each other.
Furthermore, it is some-times the case that the arities of events changebetween a sort and its subsorts.
For example, sup-pose that we have two event sorts \[APPLY:NURU\](this event-sort corresponds to the usage of apply inapply glue~paint to ...) and \[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\], and that we define the latter as a subsort ofthe former.
Then, one of the arguments in the super-sort \[APPLY:NURU\] is lexically included in thesubsort \[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\] so that thesetwo sorts basically have different arities.
Thedefinition of \[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\] is alreadygiven as (7).
The definition of \[APPLY:NURU\] isgiven as follows.
(13) (Def-Pred \[APPLY:NURU\]{argl :=,arg2 := \[PAINT:PENKI\] v \[GLUE:NORI\],arg3 :=,eng := {head := {e-lex := apply-to},agt := <l argl>,obj := <!
arg2>,loc := <l arg3>},jpn := {head := {j-lex := nuru}agt := <!
argl>,obj := <l arg2>,loc := <l arg3>} })The sort relationship between \[APPLY:NURU\] and\[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\] is defined as follows.
(14) (<->> (<*.ARG2>,<ARG2.ARG3>)SUB: \[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\]SUP: \[APPLY:NURU\]CON:ARG2(self, x) & \[PAINT:PENKI\](x))'<*.ARG2>' and '<ARG2.ARG3>' in this notationmean that the argument-2 in the supersort disappearsin the subsort and that the argument-3 in the super-sort is mapped to the argument-2 in the subsort.
'ARGi' in the CON-part is taken as referring to theargument structures of the supersorL Unspecifiedarguments remain unchanged between the sorts.5.
Sketch of the Transfer PhaseThe transfer phase is divided into three sub-phases as follows.
(a) Transforming from thematic role structures ofsource sentences into schema of logicalformulae(like (3))- 278 -(b) Determining logical formulae bydescending/ascending sort hierarchies" duringthis phase, inferences based on knowledge aremade, and questions are asked to users, ifnecessary.
(c) Transforming from logical formulae tothematic role structures in the target.All of these steps are performed by referringto the definitions of bilingual signs.We can index each bilingual sign by the sur-face word whose 'meaning': is expressed by thesign.
Roughly speaking, a :word indexing a bil-ingual sign is either the word which appears as headin the linguistic form definitions or the word whichis the value in a feature marked by '/' (like nantokain the example \[MANAGE:NANTOKA\]).Step (a) in the above is a rather straightfor-ward process which can be recursively performedthrough thematic structures.
At each recursion level,the system(i) identifies the (semantic) head of the level,(ii) retrieves the vaguest possible bilingual signsfor the head word(iii) transforms the local structures governed bythe head word according to the definition ofthe bilingual signs retrieved at (ii).Because a predicate schema of a Word mayhave several possible vaguest sons, step (a) pro-duces several formulae which step (b)i tries totransform into more appropriate formulae.
Theprocesses of descending in sort hierarchies (disambi-guation processes necessary for translation) are per-formed for different predicate schemata simultane-ously (for verbs and nouns which are related to eachother).Ascending the hierarchies is also: required,because the system has to instantiate all the predi-cate schemata contained in formula, and constraintsimposed by different predicates in a schema of for-mulae may conflict with each other.
It: may alsohappen that there are no corresponding target lexi-cal items for source items, fin these cases, the sys-tem has to loosen constraints by ascending hierar-chies.
Therefore, step (b)i is a kind of relaxationprocess which tries to find the most accurate solu-tions satisfying all constraints.
During this process,some general inference mechanisms may be invokedto infer necessary information for navigating inhierarchies and, if necessary, questions will beposed to human users.\[Estival, 1990\] also proposed using a partialorder of transfer ules to choose preferred transla-tions or prevent less preferred translations frombeing generated.
He assumes that such a partialorder of rules can be automatically computed interms of specificities of conditions on individualtransfer ules.
We also use a partial order of rules(in our case, lexical transfer ules) to choose transla.tions, but the SlJecificity relationships in our systemare concerned With lexical semantics and are notautomatically computed but defined externally by ahuman based on his/her bilingual intuition.
Theseexternally imposed specificity (sort-subsort) rela.tionships also define possible paraphrasing and areeffectively used:to disambiguate ransfer ambiguitie sby dialogue.6.
Disambiguation of transfer ambiguities byparaphrasingBecause of the explicitness of mutual relation,ships in the sort hierarchies, we can easily expressan event (or object) in diversified ways in bothlanguages.
This paraphrasing facility is very usefulfor forming and posing appropriate questions duringthe transfer phase to monolingual users of thesource language.Consider the following situation:(15a) Input sentence: The teacher uns X.
(15b) System's knowledge about sons:\ [RUN:HASHIRASERU\]\[EXECUTE.J1KKOOSURU\] I \ [MANAGE:KEIEISURU\]I I II I I IlRUN:J IKKOOSURU\] \ [RUN:UN'EISURU\]As we have already seen, run can be translated intoseveral different verbs in Japanese.
Suppose that thesort \[RUN:HKSHIRASERU\] is the least specific sortwhich run can: describe.
An event of this sort can bedirectly transformed into Japanese expressions byusing hashiraseru.
However, the direct translation issometimes awkward if more specific lexical itemsexist.The system tries to descend in the hierarchy.In this example, there are two candidates:\[RUN:JIKKOOSURU\] and \[RUN:UN'EISURU\].Three ways of disambiguation by questions are pos-sible : verbalize sort restrictions on argumentsdirectly (ex: (16)), use the other event-sons whichare not shared by both sorts such as (17), and usethese two strategies (ex: (18)).
(16) Is X an organization or a computer program ?
(17) Does the teacher execute X or does theteacher manage X ?
(18) Does the teacher execute X \[a program\] ordoes the teacher manage X \[an organization\] 9.7.
Conelusioln and further discussionIn this paper, we have shown that(a) our idea of bilingual signs is useful forrepresenting the relations among lexicaltransfer rules which in traditional systems- 279 -have not been captured explicitly.
By usingthese relationships, we can pose appropriatequestions to the user for disambiguation.
(b) transfer ules which are written in our frame-work are basically reversible.
(c) the bilingual signs connect the linguistic formsof two languages and general knowledgeabout events/objects denoted by them(knowledge about sort hierarchies i the sim-plest example of this type of knowledge) in anatural way.In our future research, we have to make itclear to what extent we can treat structural changesby bilingual signs, and on the other hand, to whatextent global structural changes beyond the localrestructuring by bilingual signs are necessary.
Wethink at present hat most of the global structuralchanges in conventional transfer systems, thoughnecessary for natural translations, actually changethe "meanings" of source sentences and should betreated by inference mechanisms external to the"linguistic" processing in translation.
Though weonly treat the predicates and arguments of bilingualsigns, we would have to treat adjuncts as well inorder to translate a whole sentence.
This is relatedto how to control the rule application and how toensure that all the parts of the source structure areprocessed.
The method of formulating questions fordisambiguation is still incomplete, though ourmethod seems promising.
We have to investigatewhat sorts of paraphrasing are really helpful formaking bilingual ambiguities obvious to monol-ingual users.AcknowledgementsThis work is supported partly by the researchcontract with ATR (Advanced TelecommunicationResearch Lab.)
