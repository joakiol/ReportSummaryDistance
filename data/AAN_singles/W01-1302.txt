Specification in terms of interactional properties as a way to optimizethe representation of spatial expressionsViktor PekarBashkir State UniversityOkt.Revolutsii 3a450000 Ufa, Russiavpekar@ufanet.ruAbstractThe results of the study demonstratethat numerous object-specificrestrictions on the use of projectiveprepositions in English and Russian arepredicted by their interactional(functional) semantic properties.Object-independent perceptualproperties (such as distance betweenobjects, direction of their motion, etc)that seemingly guide the use of theexpressions, are also found to bepresupposed by their interactionalproperties.
Based on these findings, itis suggested that in addition to a basicgeometrical specification, the semanticrepresentation should containfunctional information.
Acomputational procedure of matchingan expression with a spatial sceneshould thus include detection of theinteractional properties of the scene.They can be determined through (1)retrieval of information aboutinteractional properties of specificobjects and (2) determiningfunctionally relevant object-independent perceptual properties ofthe scene.1 IntroductionBy now a number of computational models ofspatial semantics have been developed, whichaim to generate spatial references (e.g.
Gapp,1994; Logan and Sadler, 1996; Regier, 1996).
Inthese models, spatial meaning is represented interms of geometric constructs such as shapes,center of mass, distance, overlapping betweenshapes, etc.
The models are able to appropriatelymatch an expression with a novel spatialarrangement of shapes.
However, the greatdisparity of real-world scenes a spatialexpression can refer to presents a seriousproblem for this approach.
There seems to be avirtually illimitable number of object- and evensituation-specific restrictions on the usage of aparticular expression (Herskovits, 1986).Consider, for example, the preposition in, themeaning of which is often represented in terms ofthe mathematical notion "inclusion".
A scenewhere an overturned bowl is placed over a potatocannot be described by in (*the potato in thebowl), even though the potato is within thephysical boundaries of the bowl.
The spatialrelation must be described by under: the potato isunder the bowl.
Hence, the lexical entry for in hasto contain a comment that the preposition is notused when the Ground is a concave objectpositioned with its concavity openingdownwards.
On the other hand, a bulb, beingwithin the boundaries of a socket, whichconcavity does open downwards, is said to be inthe socket, but not under it.
This, in its turn, hasto be registered in the lexical entry as well.Taking into account the fact that the restrictionsare imposed on specific orientation of specificobjects, such comments in semanticrepresentations should proliferate infinitely.In a number of lexical semantics studies(Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976; Herskovits,1986; Cuyckens, 1993; Coventry, 1998; Malyarand Seliverstova, 1998), these restrictions areaccounted by the fact that spatial meaningreflects not only perceptual experience of thereferent scenes, but also their interactional(functional) conceptualization.
For example,Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976) argue that theusage of the English preposition at cannot bepredicted by such notions as "contiguity" or"juxtaposition".
There are situations, wherethese types of relations hold, but the prepositioncannot be used: *The chair is at the ocean liner.
*Bill is at Australia.
To define the meaning ofat, they introduce the notion "region" of anobject x1 ?
a portion of space "where x caninteract with y socially, physically, or inwhatever way x?s conventionally interact withy?s".
The notion of  "interaction" explainsinappropriateness of at in the two sentences: achair and an ocean liner, as well as a person anda big body of land normally do not interact witheach other.However, it remains unclear how theperceptual and functional properties relate toeach other.
Malyar and Seliverstova (1998) forsome English and Russian prepositions proposethat function is a factor complementinggeometry in predicting the usage: in those uses,where the available geometrical semanticinformation does not correctly indicate theFigure's position, it is delineated by the notion"function" of the Ground.
Cuyckens' (1993)analysis of the Dutch in similarly suggests thatin most cases its meaning can be represented bygeometric constructs like "three-dimensional","porous", "bounded", etc; and in cases, wheregeometric specification fails to explain theusage, the notion "function" is employed(notably for the case with the overturned bowland potato).
This solution, however, seemscounter-intuitive: it requires that some portion ofuses is determined by geometry and some byfunction and thus the meaning representationstill has to explicitly encode specific cases,where geometrical description is inappropriate.From the computational perspective, thisrepresentation is also hardly plausible.1 Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976) use ?x?
to refer to theobject denoted by the left argument of the preposition and?y?
for the object denoted by the right argument of thepreposition.
In the present paper to designate these entitiesthe terms ?Figure?
and ?Ground?, respectively, will be used.The present study attempts to verify thehypothesis that a functional property of apreposition presupposes its different perceptualproperties.
If the hypothesis is verified, thefinding will explain why numerous perceptuallydiverse uses of a preposition fall under onelinguistic category.
The meaning of apreposition could then be specified in terms offunction while omitting the many restrictionsnecessary in a geometry-based semanticrepresentation.The paper focuses on projective prepositions?
the English above and over and the Russian???????
and ?????2.
Projective prepositionspresent an interesting subject matter in thecontext of study of spatial reference.
Coventry?s(1998) analysis of a number of synonymic pairsof English projective prepositions (includingabove and over) demonstrated that functionplays a significant role in their semantics.
Thepresent study is to check if the usage of theRussian prepositions is also influenced byfunction.
Comparison between semantics of thevertical and frontal prepositions may revealcertain cross-domain regularities of correlationbetween perceptual and functional semanticproperties.2 MethodologyThe first stage of the study was concerned withformulation of hypotheses about particularcharacter of perceptual and functional propertiesof the prepositions.
For this purpose examples ofthe authentic usage of the prepositions inelectronic corpora (the Brown corpus, theLancaster-Oslo-Bergen corpus, the BritishNational Corpus, the Times (March 1995)) werecollected.
The corpus data were supplementedby usage examples found in literary English andRussian texts.
This stage revealed importantdistributional characteristics of the prepositions.For example, it was found that over very rarelycombines with verbs denoting an upwardmotion, such as rise, raise, lift, heave, soar,while above often does.
Hypotheses about agiven preposition were formulated in terms ofproperties of referent scenes that tend to bedescribed by this preposition.
The hypotheses2 The both prepositions denote the Figure's position on thefrontal axis of the Ground.were tested in experiments with native speakingsubjects.During the experiments subjects' judgementsabout appropriateness of the use of theprepositions in selected contexts were obtained.The methodology is based on the assumptionthat an expression is judged to be semanticallyacceptable in a context, if this context possessessemantic features that are either the same asthose of the expression or do not contradictthem; the expression is unacceptable, if thecontext contains semantic properties,contradicting those of the expression.
Thus,presence of a semantic property in the meaningof a preposition was verified in the followingmanner.
In the context, which possessed theexamined semantic property, first one and thenthe other of the contrasted prepositions wereplaced.
If there was a statistically significantdifference in distribution between subjects'evaluations of the two sentences, presence of theproperty in the semantics of a preposition wastaken to be verified.
The use of linguistic data inthe experiments is particularly suited for thepurposes of the study, because it allows fordealing with non-perceptual semantic properties,as opposed to obtaining linguistic responses topurely perceptual stimuli, e.g.
pictures ofgeometric shapes.23 English-speaking subjects participated inthe experiments.
They represented the Americanand British varieties of English (20 and 3subjects, respectively).
Their age rangedbetween 25 and 60.
All of them were collegegraduates.
As Russian-speaking subjects, 45graduate and undergraduate students of theEnglish Language Department of Bashkir StateUniversity (Ufa, Russia) were recruited, their ageranging between 18 and 30.During the experiment the subjects werepresented with questionnaires, each containingabout 30 pairs of identical sentences, whichdiffered only in the prepositions used.
Thesentences used were edited authentic examplesof the use of the prepositions.
The subjects wereinstructed to evaluate appropriateness of the useof the prepositions in the sentences according toa 5-degree scale.
In case they perceived asentence as ambiguous, they were asked to pointit out and leave it unevaluated.The difference between the pairs of sentencesthus formed was analyzed in terms of theStudent t criterion and the chi-square criterion.The difference in evaluations between thesentences (and hence between the semantics ofthe prepositions) was taken to be established, ifthe ?
value was smaller than 0.05.
In thefollowing discussion, paired sentences with?<0.05 are used as examples, with thepreposition having smaller mean of evaluationsmarked by an asterisk.3 Perceptual PropertiesThe section describes the revealed perceptualsemantic properties of the four prepositions,which do not depend on specific objects andnamely those properties which pertain to motionof the Figure, distance between the Figure andthe Ground and choice of reference frame3.
Theusage of over and ????

In 2 the position of the Figure roofrelative to the Ground trees is describedsimultaneously in the absolute reference frame(relative to the gravity axis) and the egocentricreference frame: the roof is not directly over thetrees; the roof and the trees are vertically co-related only from the point of view of the3 Strictly speaking, reference frame is not a perceptualproperty of a scene, but a strategy of organizing theperceptual input.

the end-point of a trajectory) ofa downward motion of the Figure toward theGround (5).
It can also denote Source (i.e.
thestarting point of a trajectory) of an upwardmotion of the Figure away from the Ground (6):(5) He pulled his cap down over (*above) his eyes.
(6) The executioner removed his sword from over(*above) Peter?s head.The preposition above, on the contrary, isused to denote Goal of an upward motion of theFigure away from the Ground (7) and Source of adownward motion of the Figure toward theGround (8):(7) He raised his cap above (*over) his eyes.
(8) A meteorite falling from above (*over) us.In Russian to denote Goals and Sources ofthe Figure?s motion on a horizontal plane theprepositions ?
(Goal of motion toward theGround), ??
(Source of motion away from theGround), ??????
(Goal of motion away from theGround) and ???????
(Source of motion towardthe Ground) are used.
However, the prepositions?????

have different degrees ofacceptability when different Paths (i.e.trajectories) of the Figure?s motion along theGround?s frontal axis are in question.

Of conceptualization of distancebetween the Figure and the Ground inoccurrences of above and ???????
also speaksthe fact that these prepositions, unlike theirsynonyms, are used when degree of remotenessof one object from the other is specified.

are alsoused to denote the point where the Figure istraversing a projective axis of the Ground,typically at such a distance from it, thatconceptualized as negligibly small and also notexcluding a contact between the objects5.

Theprepositions ?????
and over convey informationabout functional interdependence between theobjects, whereas the prepositions ???????
andabove ?
of functional separation orindependence of the objects.The first type of functional information isphysical interaction between the Figure and theGround, which is taking place at the moment inquestion.
The result of this interaction is usuallychange of some physical (integrity, temperature,etc) or interactional (visibility, possibility tomanipulate, etc) characteristic of one of theobjects.
One of the objects ?

?He was killed by a bomb that exploded in frontof him.
?Second, the prepositions can describe suchfunctional relations, whereby one object isconceptualized as protecting the other one frominfluence from without the functional unity:(25) He carefully held his hat over (*above) thecandle to protect it from the rain.

?Third, the relations between objects can beconceptualized in such a manner that one objectis seen as having a potential to establish aninfluence over the other one; at the moment inquestion, however, no influence is exerted.
Todescribe this type of relations the term?functional potential?
will be used, which wasintroduced by Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976)to designate a similar interactional property ofartifacts.

?There is a letter on mydesk, right in front of me.
?To sum up, the prepositions over and ????
?are found to convey information of threeidentical types of functional relations betweenthe Figure and the Ground: actual physicalinteraction, protection, functional potential; theprepositions above and ???????
conveyinformation of absence / impossibility toestablish such functional relations.
As is clear,the functional properties presuppose perceptualproperties that are specific for particular objects.5 Correlation between Functional andPerceptual PropertiesThe study revealed that each of the three typesof the object-independent perceptual propertiesof each of the prepositions can be present in onereferent scene simultaneously together with thefunctional property of this preposition, but notwith the one contradicting it.
This regularity isestablished from subjects?
acceptabilityjudgements of sentences where informationabout either presence or absence of functionalrelations is added to information about aparticular object-independent perceptualproperty.The study replicated results of Carlson-Radvansky and Irwin (1993), who demonstratedcorrelation between presence of functionalrelations and choice of the intrinsic referenceframe, on the one hand, and between absence offunctional relations and choice of the egocentricreference frame, on the other.
For example, in 3,where, as it was shown, choice of the intrinsicreference frame necessitates the use of ????
?,the postman?s position is such that allowsfunctional interaction between him and themailbox (the postman may be taking mail out ofthe mailbox).
If it is manifestly shown that thepostman cannot interact with the mailbox,???????
(or some other preposition like ??????near?)
is preferred to ?????
:(37) ?????????

?The postman was standing ahead of /near the mailbox, talking to a roadsweeper.
?In 4, where the intrinsic reference frame isalso chosen, the position of the hammer is suchthat allows its functional interaction with thenail.
Both in 3 and 4 the Figures (the postmanand the hammer) and the Grounds (the mailboxand the nail) are conceptualized as facing eachother by their functionally relevant sides.In uses of ???????
and above, absence offunctional relations between the Figure and theGround can combine with choice of theegocentric reference frame.
In 1 the stool andthe table do not necessarily face each other bytheir functional sides, the two objects do nothave to constitute a functional unity.
Forexample, the stool may be at such a distanceaway from the table that a person seated on itcannot interact with the table.
The co-position ofthe trees and the roof described in 2 does notallow any sort of interaction between them.The Figure?s approaching the Ground (38a)and an insignificantly small distance betweenthe two objects (39a) are found to correlate withthe emergence and the presence of functionalrelations between them, correspondingly.
(38a) He pulled his lamp down over his sheets to seethe scheme better.
(38b) *He pulled his lamp down over his sheets sothat it does not obstruct the view.
(39a) The helicopter was hovering low over the boatto save the crew.
(39b) *The helicopter was hovering low over theboat in order not to be detected.The Figure?s departing from (40a) and a bigdistance between the two objects (41a) correlatewith discontinuation and absence of functionalrelations between them.
(40a) To let the sun rays play on his face he pulledhis cap up above his eyes.
(40b) *To conceal his face from the sunrays, hepulled his cap up above his eyes.
(41a) She sat on a branch high above the lions so thatthey could not get at her.
(41b) *She sat on a branch high above the lions andfed them.Examples 38b, 39b, 40b and 41b show thatthe opposite is not possible.
In a given scene,perceptual properties, corresponding to those ofa given preposition, cannot combine with thefunctional properties that contradict those of thispreposition.
As is easily seen, this regularity isnot just a peculiarity of the prepositions, butrather a matter of common sense.
Removing theprepositions and expressing the idea in any otherwords cannot make the sentences semanticallywell-formed: *The helicopter was hovering lowin order not to be detected from the boat.
*Shesat high on a tree branch and fed the lions.
Itcan be expected that other prepositions, whichpossess the same functional properties, alsopossess corresponding perceptual properties.From the correspondences between theobject-independent perceptual properties of apreposition and its functional property, one canconclude that the two types of semanticproperties presuppose each other.
Theperceptual properties can be said to befunctionally relevant, that is, perceiving theseproperties, the observer forms an idea about thefunctional aspect of the scene.
For example, oneobject?s approaching some other oneautomatically triggers conceptualization of apossibility that the former influences the latter.6 ConclusionThe English vertical above and over and theRussian frontal ?????
and ???????
are found topossess similar object-independent perceptualproperties, which pertain to motion, distance,and choice of the reference frame.
All the fourprepositions are also found to have similarfunctional properties ?
their usage is sensitive to(1) interaction between the Figure and theGround that is currently taking place; (2) theFigure?s preventing the Ground from beingphysically influenced (?protection?
); (3)potential interaction between the objects(?functional potential?).
Conceptualization ofinteraction in these cases hinges on experientialknowledge about functionality of specificobjects.
For example, a human is usuallyconceptualized as (potentially) acting upon anobject, located near him/her.
The fact thatspecific objects are perceptually different, buthave the same functional status, explains object-specific restrictions necessary in a geometry-based semantic specification.The object-independent perceptual propertiesof referent scenes that determine the usage ofthe prepositions are found to be functionallyrelevant, i.e.
by perceiving these properties theobserver is able to form an idea about thefunctional aspect of the scene.
That is whyfunctional relations are conceptualized even inthose cases when the spatially correlated objectsdo not have any inherent function (i.e.
"naturalkind objects" like clouds, fog, or rocks).
Theseare such cases when, for example, small distancetriggers off conceptualization of potentialinteraction between objects, or great distance -impossibility of interaction.Thus, the object-specific and object-independent perceptual properties of each of thefour prepositions are presupposed by itsfunctional property.
The established correlationbetween the perceptual and functional propertiesallows not to keep geometry and functiondistinct in the lexical entries, and thus to avoidthe necessity to explicitly specify cases that aredetermined by geometry and cases that aredetermined by function.
On this account, anoptimal semantic representation will includeonly functional semantic properties andinformation about the particular projective axison which the Figure is located.Based on these findings, a computationallyplausible procedure of matching a prepositionwith a referent scene may be proposed.
Theprocedure should include detection of thefunctional properties of the scene.
They can bedetermined through (1) retrieval of interactionalinformation about specific objects, e.g.
theirfunctionally relevant sides; (2) functionallyrelevant object-independent perceptualproperties of the scene, e.g.
distance betweenobjects, direction of their motion, etc.
After thatthe scene is described by that preposition thatpossesses the corresponding functional semanticproperty.The conducted study, however, does notallow one to think that meanings of the verticaland the frontal prepositions are entirelyidentical.
The frontal prepositions ???????
and????
?, unlike the vertical prepositions above andover, cannot denote Goal and Source of theFigure?s motion: there are special prepositionsto denote these entities.
Nonetheless, such casesare not numerous and can be presented asexceptions in the lexical entries without makingthe semantic representation too bulky andunmanageable.ReferencesLaura A. Carlson-Radvansky and D. E. Irwin.
