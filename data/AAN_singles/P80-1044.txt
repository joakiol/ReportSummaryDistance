An Experiment in Machine Trans la t ionINTRODUCTIONAlthough funding for Machine Translation (MT) researchvirtua11y ended in the U.S. with the release of theALPAC report \[1\] in 1966, there has been a continuinginterest in this f ie ld.
Rapid evolution of science andtechnology, coupled with increased world-wlde exposureof their products, demands more and more speed in trans-lation (e.g., in the case of operation and maintenancemanuals).
Unfortunately, this rapid evolution has madetranslation an even more d i f f i cu l t  and time-consumingtask.
The large surplus of (presumably qualified)translators cited by the ALPAC report simply does notex is t  in many techn ica l  areas;  the cur rent  s ta te  ofa f fa i r s  Finds instead a c r i t i ca l  shortage.
In add i t ion ,the propor t ion  of  sc ient i f i c  and techn ica l  l i te ra ture  ?publ ished in Engl ish  is d imin ish ing .
As qua l i f ied  humant rans la tors  become more scarce and costs of  human t rans -la t ion  r i se  wh i le  costs of  purchase and operat ion  ofpowerful  computer systems fa l l ,  there must come a timewhen, i f  MT is feas ib le  at  a l l ,  i t  w i l l  be cos t -e f fec -t i ve .
I t  is appropr ia te ,  then,  to invest igate  thestate-of-the-art in MT with respect to two central ques-tions: is high-quality MT Feaslble (and in what sense);and i f  feasible, is i t  cost-effectlve?Thls paper repor ts  the resu l ts  of  an exper iment inh lgh ly  automat ic ,  h igh-qua l i ty  machine t rans la t ion .
TheLRC's MT system, METAL ( fo r  Mechanical T rans la t ion  andAna lys i s  of  Languages), is an advanced, ' th i rd  genera-t ion '  system incorporat ing  proven Natura l  Language Pro-cessing (NLP) techniques,  both syntact i c  and semantic,and stands at the fo re f ront  of  the MT research F ront ie r .In the exper iment ,  METAL was employed in the t rans la t ionof  a 50-page taxt  From German in to  Engi lsh  in order  todetermine whether the system as i t  ex i s ts  can be e f fec -t i ve ly  app l ied  to cur rent  t rans ia t lon  needs, e f fec t ive -ness to be determined by some ob ject ive  measure of  thequa l i ty  and cost  of  machine ( i .e .
,  METAL) vs.  humant rans la t ion .EARLIER MT EFFORTSSince Bruderer  \[2\] has recent ly  publ ished a completesurvey of  MT pro jec ts ,  and Hutchins \[3\]  reviews themost important developments through 1977, we wi l l  men-tion only a few of the major efforts.
The f i r s t  populardemonstration of the possibi l i t ies in MT was provided byIBM and the Georgetown University group in 19S4 \[4\].With a vocabulary of about 250 words and a grammar com-prising some six rules in what was called an "operation-al syntax", the system demonstrated some rudimentarycapability in Russian to English translation.
This in-stlgated a massive government funding ef for t  over thenext decade, and some 20 mill ion dollars was invested in17 different projects.
By 1965 the Mark II Russian-English system \[5\] had been installed at the ForeignTechnology Division of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, and the Georgetown system had been deli-vered to the Atomic Energy Commission at Oak Ridge Na-tlonal Laboratory and to EURATOM in Ispra, I taly.
Re-viewing MT systems such as these at the request of theNational Science Foundation, the Automatic Language Pro-cessing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) reported in 1966 thatMT was slower, less accurate, and more expensive thanhuman translation; further, that there was no predlcta-ble prospect of improvement in MT capability.
Thoughstrongly and perhaps just i f iab ly  cr it ic ized \[6\], thisreport soon resulted in the virtual elimination of MTfunding in the U.S., and a sizeable reduction in fo~ignefforts as well.Jonathan SlocumI .

This cu lmina-ted in SYSTRAN \ [7 \ ] ,  which replaced Mark I I  at  WPAFB in1970 and the Georgetown system at EURATOM in 1976.SYSTRAN was a lso  used by NASA dur ing  the Apo l lo -Soyuzmiss ion .
In 1976 the Commission of  European Communitiesadopted SYSTRAN for  Eng l i sh  to French t rans la t ion ;  how-ever ,  an eva luat ion  of  i t s  t rans la t ions  by the EEC post -ed i to rs  in Brussels  found the resu l ts  to be fa r  from sat -i s fac tory :  "a l l  the rev isors  had exhausted the i r  pat iencebefore  the end" \ [8 \ ] .
Despi te  i t s  genera l ly  low t rans la -t ion  qua l i ty ,  SYSTRAN is the most w ide ly  used MT systemto date.
i t s  ch ie f  commercial compet i to r ,  LOGOS \ [9 \ ] ,  isanother  example o f  a "d i rec t "  MT system.
As in SYSTRAN,the ana lys i s  and synthes is  components are separated butthe l ingu is t i c  procedures are designed fo r  a spec i f i csource- language (SL) and target - language (TL) pa i r .

8ruderer  \[2\]  repor ts  fu r ther  development fo rt rans la t ion  in to  Russian, and exper iments on French, Ger-man and Spanish,  but prov ides  few deta i l s .In an e f fo r t  to cor rect  the obvious inadequacies ofthese and other  ' f i r s t  generat ion '  systems, which essen-t ia l i y  t rans la te  word- fo r -word  w i th  no at tempt  at  a un i -f ied  ana lys i s  at  the sentence leve l ,  and which were de-veloped ab in i t io  fo r  a spec i f i c  SL-TL pa i r ,  researchersbegan to invest igate  methods of  ana lyz ing  sentences in tos t ructures  from which in theory  any TL could be genera-ted.
There are two broad types of  such 'second genera-t ion '  systems.
One type produces analyses in a "neut ra l "s t ructure ,  or  ' in ter l ingua~;  the o ther  produces SL syn-tac t i c  s t ructures  which are t ransformed v ia  a processca l led  ' t rans fer '  in to  a syntact i c  s t ructure  fo r  the TLsentence.
One example of  the former approach is thesystem produced by the Centre d '~tudes  pour la Traduc-t lon  Automatique (CETA) at  the Un ivers i ty  o f  Grenoble\ [11 \ ] .
During the per iod  from 1961 to 1971 th i s  groupdeveloped a Russian to French MT system.
An eva luat ionat  the end of  that  per iod  revealed that  on ly  42~ o f  thesentences were being cor rect ly  t rans la ted .
Some fa i l -ures were due to e r rors  in the input ,  but  the major i tywere due to programming er rors ,  fa i lu re  to produce alex ica l  ana lys i s  of  a word or  a syntact i c  ana lys i s  of  asentence, inefficiencies in the parser causing it  to ap-ply too many rules, etc.
The Traduction Automatique del'Universit~ de MontrEal (TAUM) project \[12\] is an exam-ple of the transfer approach.
There are flve grammarscalled "q-systems" to effect morphological and syntacticanalysis of English, then transfer, then syntactic andmorphological synthesis of French.
Each such stage con-sists of a series of generalized tree-structure transfoPmations.
The significance of TAUM is that, of the sec-ond-generation systems, i t  is the nearest to operationalimplementation: i t  is to be applied to the translationof a i rcraf t  maintenance manuals.in 1978 the European project EUROTRA was init iated, ap-parently adopting the newer Grenoble system ARIANE, inorder to produce an advanced, second generation MT sys-tem for the eventual replacement of the f i r s t  genera-tion system (SYSTRAN) currently in use \[8\].
The Greno-ble group, now t i t \ ]ed Groupe d'Etudes pour la Traduc-tion Automatlque (GETA), abando'ed their earl ier ap-proach in light of its deficiencies and produced a sys-tem to translate in s ix  passes: morphological analysis,multi-level (syntactic and semantic) analysis, lexicaltransfer, structural transfer, syntactic generation, andmorphological generation.
Multi-level analysis, struc-tural transfer, and syntactic generation are all  effec-ted ~.a a general tree-to-tree transducer program, some-163what less powerfu; but merhaps more eff ic ient than the Q-systems transduce r in TAUM; the other components have Spe-cial programs suited to their function.
The emphasis inthis project is apparently twofold: increased efficiencyand re l iab i l i ty  through adoption of components with theminimum necessary power, and decreased sensit iv i ty tofai)ure in individual stages through the expedient of in-suring that every component has some output, even i fsuch output is nothing more than the or ig ina l  input.
I fwe have in terpreted  the VauQuois mimeo \[8\] p roper ly ,  thismust be ~e largest  and most comprehensive MT pro jec t  yetundertaken.DESCRIPTION OF METALThere are two different classifications of "generations"in MT systems.
The f i r s t  posits three generations (cur-rently) according to the following cr i ter ia:  (I) trans-lation is word-for-word, with no significant syntacticanalysis; (2) translation proceeds after obtaining acomplete syntactic analysis of an input, with no s ign i f i -cant semantic analysis; (3) translation proceeds afterobtaining a complete semantic analysis of an input.
Thedefinit ion of ' third generation' says nothing about ex-tra-sentential information, and one might posit a'fourth generation' which employs such information.
Theother classif ication proceeds according to the followingcr i ter ia:  (l) translation proceeds "d i rect ly"  from theSL to the TL, and the SL is analyzed only to the minimumextent necessary to generate TL equivalents; (2) trans-lation proceeds " indirect ly"  by deriving a more-or-lessstandard analysis of the input, independent of the TL in-volved (but not necessarily of the SL), and then genera-ting TL output based on the standard analysis.
Withinthis definit ion of 'second generation', as noted above,there are the 'transfer' vs. ' interl ingua' approaches.We prefer to characterize METAL as a ' third generation'system according to the f i r s t  c lass i f i ca t ion  given abovebecause th is  makes i t  c lear  that METAL der ives a sub-s tant ia l  semantic ana lys i s ,  whereas the second def in i t ionof 'second generat ion '  does not necessar i l y  imply thatsemantic ana lys is  of  any kind is performed.METAL comprises two d is t inc t  components: the l ingu is t i cand the computat ional .
The l ingu is t i c  component con-s i s ts  o f  lex icons ,  phrase-s t ructure  grammar ru les ,  caseframes and t rans format ions .
SL and TL lex ica l  ent r iesinclude feature -va lue  pairs  encoding syntact i c  and sem-ant i c  in format ion such as grammatical category,  in f lec -t iona l  c lass ,  semantic type, and case in format ion (seeFigure \ ] ) .
T ransfer  lex ica l  ent r ies  ind icate  how andunder what condi t ions  words or idioms in one languaget rans la te  into  words or idioms in another (see Figure2).
The phrase-s t ructure  rules may be augmented wi thprocedures to determine the i r  app l i ca t ion  v ia  feature /value tes ts ,  to add or copy features and values in thein terpretat ion  being constructed,  to invoke case-framerout ines ,  and to invoke spec i f i c  or general t ransforma-t ions .
Case-frame rout ines determine semantic case re-la t ionsh ips  between verbs and nouns on the basis o f  syn-tac t i c  and semantic features ,  and produce the i r  outputin the form of  p ropos i t iona l  t rees.
T rans format io ' -  arepat tern -pa i rs  that spec i fy  old and new tree s t ruc tures ;when invoked, a t ransformat ion attempts to match i ts"o ld"  side against the current  s t ruc tura l  descr ip tor ,and i f  successful converts it  into one matching its"new" side.
In the process, features and values may betested and set arb i t rar i}y.
This provides the grammar.with v i r tua l ly  unlimite~ -ontext sensi t iv i ty ,  but sinceno interpretation can affect the operation of the parseri t  s t i l l  enjoys the advantages of context-free opera-tion.
Finally, there is a method for scoring, or rating,interpretations; this allows the system to determine the"best" interpretation for translation, and also providesanother mechanism for rejecting the application of anyrule, viz, a score below cutoff.
