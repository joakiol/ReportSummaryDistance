We present anapproach to annotating a level of discoursestructure that is based on identifying discourseconnectives and their arguments.
The PDTBis being built directly on top of the Penn Tree-Bank and Propbank, thus supporting the extrac-tion of useful syntactic and semantic featuresand providing a richer substrate for the devel-opment and evaluation of practical algorithms.We provide a detailed preliminary analysis ofinter-annotator agreement ?
both the level ofagreement and the types of inter-annotator vari-ation.1 IntroductionLarge scale annotated corpora have played a critical rolein speech and natural language research.
The Penn Tree-Bank (PTB) is an example of such a resource with world-wide impact on natural language processing (Marcus etal., 1993).
However, the PTB deals with text only atthe sentence level: with the demand for more power-ful NLP applications comes a need for greater richnessin annotation.
At the sentence level, Penn Propbankis adding predicate-argument annotation to sentences inPTB (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).
At the discourse-level are efforts to produce corpora annotated with rhetor-ical relations (Carlson et al, 2003).
This paper describesa more basic discourse-level annotation project ?
thePenn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) ?
that aims to producea large-scale corpus in which discourse connectives areannotated, along with their arguments.There have been several approaches to describing dis-course in terms of discourse relations (Mann and Thomp-son, 1988; Asher and Lascarides, 1998; Polanyi andvan den Berg, 1996).
In these approaches, the additionalmeaning the discourse contributes beyond the sentencederives from discourse relations.
Specification of the dis-course relations for a discourse thus constitutes a descrip-tion of a certain level of discourse structure.Rather than starting from (abstract) discourse rela-tions, we describe an approach to annotating a large-scale corpus in terms of a more basic characterisationof discourse structure in terms of discourse connectivesand their arguments.
The motivation for such an ap-proach stems from work by Webber and Joshi (1998),Webber et al (1999a), Webber et al (2000) which inte-grates sentence level structures with discourse level struc-ture (using tree-adjoining grammars for both cases, LTAGand DLTAG, respectively).1 This allows structural com-position and its associated semantic composition at thesentence level to be smoothly carried over to the dis-course level, a goal also shared by Gardent (1997),Schilder (1997) and Polanyi and van den Berg (1996),among others.2Discourse connectives and their arguments can be suc-cessfully annotated with high reliability (cf.
Section4).
This is not surprising, given that the task resem-bles that of annotating verbs and their arguments atthe sentence level (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).
Infact, we use a fine-grained, lexically grounded annota-tion in which argument labels are specific to the dis-1In the PDTB annotations, we have deliberately adopteda policy to make the annotations independent of the DLTAGframework for two reasons: (1) to make the annotated corpuswidely useful to researchers working in different frameworksand (2) to make the annotators?
task easier, thereby increasinginterannotator reliability.2However, the approaches in Gardent (1997),Schilder (1997), and Polanyi and van den Berg (1996) aredifferent in two ways: a) the process by which discoursederives compositional aspects of meaning is considered entirelyseparate from how clauses do so, and b) only two mechanismsare used for deriving discourse semantics ?
compositionalsemantics and inference.course connectives involved, in much the same way asin Kingsbury and Palmer (2002).
In contrast, a recentattempt (Carlson et al, 2003) at using RST-type rela-tions for annotating a much smaller corpus has alreadyrevealed difficulties involved in reliably annotating moreabstract discourse relations.
Moreover, this type of anno-tation does not contain any record of the basis on whicha relation was assigned.The paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 providesa brief overview of the fundamental ideas that providethe basis for the design of the PDTB annotation.
Section3 gives a detailed description of the annotation project,including information about the size of the corpus, com-pleted annotations as well as annotation instructions asformulated in the guidelines.
Section 4 presents dataanalysis based on current annotations as well as resultsfrom inter-annotator agreement.
Section 5 wraps up witha summary of the work.2 Theoretical backgroundThe annotation project presented in this paper buildson basic ideas presented in Webber and Joshi (1998),Webber et al (1999b) and Webber et al (2003) ?
thatconnectives are discourse-level predicates which projectpredicate-argument structure on a par with verbs at thesentence level.
Webber and Joshi (1998) propose a tree-adjoining grammar for discourse (DLTAG) in whichcompositional aspects of discourse meaning are for-mally defined, thus teasing apart compositional from non-compositional layers of meaning.
In this framework, con-nectives are grouped into natural classes depending on thestructure that they project at the discourse level.
Subordi-nate and coordinating conjunctions, for example, requiretwo arguments that can be identified structurally from ad-jacent units of discourse.
What Webber et al (2003) callanaphoric discourse connectives (some, but not all, dis-course adverbials, such as ?otherwise?, ?instead?, ?fur-thermore?, etc.)
also require two arguments, but only oneof them derives structurally.
For the complete interpreta-tion of these connectives, their other argument needs tobe recovered.
The crucial contribution of this frameworkto the design of the current project is what can be seenas a bottom-up approach to discourse structure.
Specifi-cally, instead of appealing to an abstract (and arbitrary)set of discourse relations whose identification involvesconfounding multiple sources of discourse meaning, westart with the annotation of discourse connectives andtheir arguments, thus exposing a clearly defined level ofdiscourse representation.3 Project descriptionThe PTDB project began in November 2002.
The firstphase, including pilot annotations and preliminary devel-opment of guidelines, was completed in May 2003.
ThePDTB is expected to be released by November 2005.
In-termediate versions of the annotated corpus will be madeavailable for receiving feedback.The PDTB corpus will include annotations of fourtypes of connectives: subordinating conjunctions, coor-dinating conjunctions, adverbial connectives and implicitconnectives.
We specify each of these types in more de-tail in Section 3.1.
The final number of annotations inthe corpus will amount to approximately 30,000; 10,000implicit connectives and 20,000 annotations of the 250explicit connectives identified in the corpus.
The finalversion of the corpus will also contain characterizationsof the semantic roles associated with the arguments ofeach type of connective.In this paper we present the results of annotating 10explicit connectives, amounting to a total of 2717 anno-tations, as well as 386 tokens of implicit connectives.
Theset of 10 connectives comprises the adverbial connectives?therefore?, ?as a result?, ?instead?, ?otherwise?, ?never-theless?, and the subordinate conjunctions ?because?, ?al-though?, ?even though?, ?when?, and ?so that?.
In allcases, annotations have been performed by four annota-tors.
While this slows down the annotation process con-siderably, the nature, significance and magnitude of theproject as well as the well-known complexity of discourseannotation tasks impels us to strive for maximum relia-bility, achieved by having the task performed by multipleannotators.3Individual annotation proceeds one connective at atime.
The annotation tool WordFreak4 is used to iden-tify all instances of the given connective in the corpus,and these are then annotated independently and manu-ally by four annotators.
This way, the annotators quicklygain experience with that connective and develop a betterunderstanding of its predicate-argument characteristics.Similarly, for the annotation of implicit connectives, allinstances (as specified in the guidelines, see Section 3.2)are identified one file at a time.
For this task, the anno-tators are required to read the entire file so that they canmake well-informed and reliable decisions about the im-plicit connectives and their arguments.
In addition, afterthe arguments of each implicit connective have been iden-tified, the annotators provide, if possible, an explicit con-nective (or other suitable expression) that best expressesthe inferred relation.
As with explicit connectives, anno-tations of implicit connectives are done by four annota-3When inter-annotator consistency has stabilized, we intendto reduce the number of annotators to three, or maybe two at theminimum.4WordFreak was developed by Tom Morton at the Universityof Pennsylvania.
It has been substantially modified by JeremyLacivita to fit the needs of the PDTB project.
A snapshot of thetool can be seen at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/?pdtb.tors.Compared with Propbank?s annotation of verbpredicate-argument structures, annotation of argumentsof discourse predicates is different in interesting ways.Propbank annotators have to determine the number of ar-guments required by each verb.
In contrast, discourseconnectives exhibit a clear predicate-argument structurerequiring only two arguments.
The main challenge wehave discovered for annotating discourse connectives isdetermining the extent of their arguments.
Even subor-dinate conjunctions whose arguments never cross a sen-tence boundary may sometimes be the source of disagree-ment between annotators.In what follows, we present a brief overview of theclasses of connectives that we annotate, followed byhighlights of the annotation manual and relevant corpusexamples.3.1 Discourse connectivesWe classify discourse connectives into four classes: sub-ordinate and coordinating conjunctions, adverbials andimplicit connectives.
Examples of each type are given be-low, with their arguments shown in square brackets andthe connectives, in italics.3.1.1 Subordinate conjunctionsSubordinate conjunctions introduce clauses that aresyntactically dependent on a main clause.
The most com-mon types of relations that they express are temporal(e.g., ?when?, ?as soon as?
), causal e.g., ?because?
), con-cessive (e.g., ?although?, ?even though?
), purpose (e.g.,?so that?, ?in order that?)
and conditional (e.g., ?if?, ?un-less).
Clauses introduced with a subordinate conjunctionmay be preposed (or, more rarely, interposed) with re-spect to the main clause, as shown in (1).
(1) Because [the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles], [theyhave more than enough storage space for their newcrop], and that permits them to wait for prices to rise.3.1.2 Coordinating conjunctionsCoordinating conjunctions are ones such as ?and?,?but?, and ?or?.
Example (2) shows the annotation of aninstance of the conjunction ?and?.
(2) [William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developedan early language-housekeeper system for PCs], and[Gates became an industry billionaire six years afterIBM adapted one of these versions in 1981].Instances of coordinating conjunctions which coordi-nate nominal or other non-clausal constituents are ex-cluded from annotation.
We also exclude cases of VP-coordination because in such cases the arguments of theconnective can be retrieved automatically from the syn-tactic layer.3.1.3 Adverbial connectivesAdverbial connectives are sentence-modifying adverbswhich express a discourse relation (Forbes, 2003).
Theclass of adverbial connectives includes ?however?, ?there-fore?, ?then?, ?otherwise?, etc.
In this class, we have alsoincluded prepositional phrases with a similar sentencemodifying function such as ?as a result?, ?in addition?,?in fact?, etc.
Example (3) shows the annotation of aninstance of the adverbial connective ?as a result?.
(3) ...[many analysts expected energy prices to rise at theconsumer level too].
As a result, [many economistswere expecting the consumer price index to increasesignificantly more than it did].The arguments of adverbial connectives may or maynot be adjacent to the sentence containing the connective.In a few cases, an argument may be found one or twoparagraphs away from the connective.3.1.4 Implicit connectivesImplicit connectives are identified between adjacentsentences with no explicit connectives.5 The annotationof implicit connectives is intended to capture the connec-tion between two sentences appearing in adjacent posi-tions.
For example, in (4), the two adjacent sentencesare connected in a way similar to having the explicit con-nective ?but?
contrasting them.
Indeed, for implicit con-nectives, annotators are asked to provide, when possible,an explicit connective that best describes the inferred re-lation.
The explicit connective provided in (4) was ?incontrast?.
(4) ...[The $6 billion that some 40 companies are looking toraise in the year ending March 31 compares with only$2.7 billion raised on the capital market in the previousfiscal year].
IMPLICIT-(In contrast) [In fiscal 1984 be-fore Mr. Gandhi came to power, only $810 million wasraised].3.2 Annotation guidelinesThe annotation guidelines for PDTB have been revisedconsiderably since the pilot phase of the project in May2003.
The current version of the guidelines is available athttp://www.cis.upenn.edu/?pdtb.
Below we out-line the basic points.3.2.1 What counts as a discourse connective?We count as discourse connectives (1) all subordinat-ing and coordinating conjunctions, (2) certain adverbials,and (3) implicit connectives.
The adverbials include onlythose which convey a relation between events or states.For example, in (5) ?as a result?
conveys a cause-effect re-lation between the event of limiting the size of new steel5There are, of course, other implicit connectives that we arenot taking into account.mills and that of the industry operating out of small, ex-pensive and highly inefficient units.
In contrast, the se-mantic interpretation of ?strangely?
in (6) only requires asingle event/state which it classifies in the set of strangeevents/states.6(5) [In the past, the socialist policies of the governmentstrictly limited the size of new steel mills, petrochem-ical plants, car factories and other industrial concerns toconserve resources and restrict the profits businessmencould make].
As a result, industry operated out of small,expensive, highly inefficient industrial units.
(6) Strangely, conventional wisdom inside the Beltway re-gards these transfer payments as ?uncontrollable?
or?nondiscretionary.
?The guidelines also highlight instances of lexical itemswith multiple functions, only one of which is as a dis-course connective.
For example, ?when?
can either serveas a subordinate conjunction or introduce a relative clausemodifying a nominal phrase, as in (7), where the when-clause modifies the nominal ?1985?.7Here we again ben-efit from building discourse annotation on top of PennTreeBank because the syntactic annotation of when-clauses distinguishes the two functions: When-relativesare marked as NP-modifiers adjoining to an NP, whereasadverbial when-clauses adjoin to a sentential node.
(7) Attorneys have argued since 1985, when the law tookeffect.Similarly, some since-clauses function as NP modifiersas shown in (8).
In such cases, ?since?
is not annotated asa connective.
As in the case of when-clauses, instances ofNP modifying since-clauses can be identified in the PennTreeBank by virtue of their syntactic annotation.
(8) In the decade since the communist nation emerged fromisolation, its burgeoning trade with the West has liftedHong Kong?s status as a regional business partner.Finally, implicit connectives count as connectives.They are identified between adjacent sentences which donot contain any other explicit connectives.
Currently, weare not annotating implicit connectives intra-sententially,such as between the matrix clause and free adjunct in Ex-ample (9).
We plan to incorporate annotations of implicitintra-sentential connectives at a later stage of the project.
(9) Second, they channel monthly mortgage payments intosemiannual payments, reducing the administrative bur-den on investors.6For a more detailed discussion of the basis for distin-guishing discourse adverbials from clausal adverbials, seeForbes (2003).7In cases of when-relatives, a when-clause can be annotatedas SUP (see Section 3.2.3).3.2.2 What counts as a legal argument?Because we take discourse relations to hold betweenabstract objects, we require that an argument contains atleast one predicate along with its arguments.
Of course,a sequence of clauses or sentences may also form a legalargument, containing multiple predicates.Because our annotations are done directly on top ofthe Penn TreeBank, annotators may select as an argumentcertain textual spans that appear to exclude one or morearguments of the predicate.
These are cases in whichthese arguments are directly retrievable from the syntac-tic annotation.
Thus, we are able to select only the pred-icates that are required for the interpretation of the dis-course connective and simultaneously access their argu-ments for the complete interpretation of the clause whilekeeping the annotations of single arguments simple andmaximally contiguous.
In (10), for example, the relativeclause is marked as one of the two arguments of the con-nective ?even though?.
The subject of the verb in the rela-tive clause is directly retrievable from the Penn TreeBankannotation.
Similarly, in (11) the subject of the infinitivalclause is also available from the syntactic representation.
(10) Workers described ?clouds of dust?
[that hung overparts of the factory] even though [exhaust fans venti-lated the air].
(11) The average maturity for funds open only to institutions,considered by some [to be a stronger indicator] because[those managers watch the market closely], reached ahigh point for the year ?
33 days.There are two exceptions to the requirement that anargument include a verb ?
these are nominal phrases thatexpress an event or a state, and discourse deictics thatdenote an event or state.
In (12), for example, the nominalphrase ?fainting spells?
can be marked as a legal argumentof the connective ?when?
because the phrase expresses anevent of fainting.
(12) Its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of de-bate, clammy hands in the face of congressional crit-icism, and [fainting spells] when [someone writes theword ?controversy.?
]Discourse deictic expressions are forms such as ?this?and ?that?
that can be used to denote the interpretationof clausal textual spans from the preceding discourse.In (13), for example, ?that?
denotes the interpretation ofthe sentence immediately preceding it.
Our annotatorsare guided to make argument selections that assume thatanaphoric and deictic expressions have been resolved.Thus, in (13), they are able to select ?That?s?
as one ar-gument of the connective ?because?.
(13) Airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market?s price-earnings ratio ?
whichis currently about 13 times earnings.
[That?s] because[airline earnings, like those of auto makers, have beensubject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy].The annotators are also informed that in some cases,an argument of a connective must be derived from theselected textual span (Webber et al, 1999a; Webber et al,2003).
This is the case for the first argument of ?instead?in (14), which does not include the negation, although itis contained in the selected text.8(14) [No price for the new shares has been set].
Instead, [thecompanies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide].In sum, legal arguments can be groups of sentences,single sentences (a main clause and its subordinateclauses), single clauses (tensed or non-tensed), NPs thatspecify events or situations, and discourse deictic expres-sions.3.2.3 How far does an argument extend?One particularly significant addition to the guidelinescame as a result of differences among annotators as tohow large a span constituted the argument of a connec-tive.
During pilot annotations, annotators used three an-notation tags: CONN for the connective and ARG1 andARG2 for the two arguments.
To this set, we have addedthe optional tags SUP1, SUP2 (supplementary) for caseswhen the annotator wants to mark textual spans s/he con-siders to be useful, supplementary information for theinterpretation an argument.
Example (15) demonstratesthe use of SUP1.
Arguments are shown in square brack-ets, while spans providing supplementary information areshown in parentheses.
(15) Although [started in 1965], [Wedtech didn?t really getrolling until 1975] (when Mr. Neuberger discovered theFederal Government?s Section 8 minority business pro-gram).4 Data analysisTo test the reliability of the annotation, we first con-sidered the kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan, 1988)which is used extensively in empirical studies of dis-course (Carletta, 1996).
The kappa coefficient providesan inter-annotator agreement figure for any number of an-notators by measuring pairwise agreement between themand by correcting for chance expected agreement.
How-ever, the statistic requires the data tokens to be classifiedinto discrete categories, and as a result, we could not ap-ply it to our data since the PDTB annotation tokens can-not be classified as such.
Rather, annotation in the PDTBconstitutes either selection of a span of text for the ar-guments of connectives which can be of indeterminatelength or providing explicit expressions for implicit con-nectives from an open-ended class of expressions.8For a preliminary corpus-based analysis of the argumentsof ?instead?, see Miltsakaki et al (2003).Instead, we have assessed inter-annotator agreement interms of agreement/disagreement on span or named ex-pression identity for each token as a percentage of thepairs of spans or expressions that actually matched ver-sus those that should have.
For the argument annotations,we use a most conservative measure - the exact matchcriterion.
In addition, we also used different diagnosticsfor the argument annotations for the explicit connectives,reporting percentage agreement on different classes of to-kens, such as those in which the first argument (ARG1)annotations and second argument (ARG2) annotationswere counted independently, as well as those in which theARG1 and ARG2 annotations (for each connective) werecounted together as a single token.
For all the argumentannotations, the computation of agreement excluded thesupplementary annotations (cf.
Section 3.2.3).We present here agreement results on ARG1 andARG2 annotations by two annotators for the annotationof ten explicit connectives, amounting to a total of 2717annotations, and 368 annotations of implicit connectives,including agreement results on the explicit expression theannotators used in in place of the implicit connectives aswell as the ARG1 and ARG2 annotations of the implicitconnectives.9 The ten explicit connectives include 5 sub-ordinating conjunctions (when, because, even though, al-though, and so that) and 5 adverbials (nevertheless, oth-erwise, instead, therefore, and as a result).4.1 Inter-annotator Agreement4.1.1 Explicit connectivesFor the explicit connective annotations, we used twodiagnostics for measuring inter-annotator agreement.
Inthe first diagnostic , we took the class of tokens as the to-tal number of argument annotations, treating ARG1 andARG2 annotations as independent tokens.
The total num-ber of tokens in this class is therefore twice the numberof connective tokens, i.e, 5434.
We recorded agreementusing the exact match criterion.
That is, for any ARG1or ARG2 token, agreement was recorded as 1 when bothannotators made identical textual selections for the an-notation and 0 when the annotators made non-identicalselections.We achieved 90.2% agreement (4900/5434 tokens)on the annotations for this class.
Agreement on onlyARG1 tokens was 86.3%, and agreement on only ARG2tokens was 94.1%.
Further distribution of the agree-ments by connective is given in Table 1.
Connectivesare grouped in the table by type (subordinating conjunc-tion (SUBCONJ) and adverbial (ADV)).

Average agreement on the adverbials was lower(71.8%).
This difference between the two types is not sur-prising, since locating the anaphoric (ARG1) argument ofadverbial connectives is believed to be a harder task thanthat of locating the arguments of subordinating conjunc-tions.
For example, the anaphoric argument of the ad-verbial connectives may be located in some non-adjacentspan of text, even several paragraphs away.
Arguments ofsubordinating conjunctions, on the other hand, can mostoften be found in spans of text adjacent to the connective.The table also shows that there was uniform agreementacross the different subordinating conjunctions (roughly90%), whereas the adverbials showed more variation.In particular, agreement on otherwise and therefore washigh (95.7% and 87.5% respectively), while lower forthe other three adverbials, instead (72.9%), as a result(65.5%), and nevertheless (59.6%).
This suggests eithergreater variability in how these adverbials are interpretedor greater complexity in their interpretation, which resultsin more variability when people are forced to associate aninterpretation with a particular text span.We also computed agreement using a second moreconservative diagnostic in which we took the class of to-kens as the total number of connective tokens (2717) sothat the ARG1 and ARG2 annotations for each connec-tive were treated together as part of the same token.
Hereagain, we recorded agreement using the exact match mea-sure.
That is, for any connective token, agreement wasrecorded as 1 when both annotators made identical tex-tual selections for the annotation of both arguments and0 when the annotators made non-identical selections forany one or both arguments.We achieved 82.8% agreement (2249/2717 tokens) onthe annotations for this class.
Table 2 gives the distribu-tion of the agreements by connective.
The table showsrelatively lower agreements when compared with the firstdiagnostic, for both subordinating conjunctions (86%) aswell as adverbials (57%).
However, this difference is un-derstandable since the token class as defined for this di-agnostic yields a stricter measure of agreement.CONNECTIVES AGR No.

Par-tial Overlap means that there was partial overlap in theannotations selected by the two annotators.
Higher verbincludes tokens where one of the annotators included thegoverning predicate for the clause marked by both anno-tators.
The higher clause occurred on the left or right pe-riphery of the lower clause.
Dependent Clause includestokens where one of the annotators included extra clausalmaterial that is syntactically dependent on the clause thatwas selected by both, and that occurs on the left or rightperiphery of the common text.
Parenthetical meansthat one of the annotators included a medial parentheti-cal, while the other did not.
The intervening text could bethe main as well as the dependent clause.
An example isprovided below:(16) Bankers said [warrants for Hong Kong stocks are at-tractive] because [they give foreign investors], wary ofvolatility in the colony?s stock market, [an opportunityto buy shares without taking too great a risk].
(17) Bankers said [warrants for Hong Kong stocks are at-tractive] because [they give foreign investors, wary ofvolatility in the colony?s stock market, an opportunityto buy shares without taking too great a risk].Other included tokens with partial overlap between an-notations, but in addition included a combination of morethan type, such as higher verb+dependent clause.Note that disagreements that contain a partial over-lap could be counted as agreeing tokens if we relaxedthe more conservative exact match measure to a partialmatch measure.
Our subjective view was that in severalcases, the ?extra?
textual material, especially those fit-ting the dependent clause and parenthetical category didnot make any significant semantic contribution in termsof their inclusion or exclusion in the argument.
With thepartial match measure, excluding these cases reduces thedisagreements to half the given number, giving us 94.5%agreement overall.The No Overlap tokens were cases of true disagree-ment in that there was no overlap in the annotations se-lected by the annotators.
These tokens constituted 5.6%of the disagreements.
Examples (18) and (19) shows thetwo annotations for a token in which there was no over-lap in the ARG1 annotation.
Missing Annotations alsoconstituted a substantial proportion of the disagreements(13.5%) and was used for tokens where the annotationwas missing for one annotator.
Note that these don?t re-ally count as disagreement, since all connectives are pre-theoretically assumed to require two arguments.
Unre-solved includes tokens which have introduced new issuesfor the annotation guidelines and cannot be resolved atthis time.
These include issues such as how to treat com-paratives, certain types of adjunct clauses, certain typesof nominalizations etc.

cannot be escaped entirely by theindustry], but salesmen dodge it wherever possible orcloak it in euphemisms, [preferring to talk about ?sav-ings?

b) cause-effect rela-tions (e.g., ?because?, ?as a result?
), c) temporal relations(e.g., ?then?, ?simultaneously?
), d) contrastive relations(e.g., ?however?, ?although?
), and e) restatement or sum-marization (e.g., ?in other words?, ?in sum?).
10 Agree-ment was then computed on these basic groups of con-nectives.11 From the total of 386 tokens of implicit con-nectives, 9 were excluded from the analysis due to tech-nical error (missing annotation).
For the remaining 307tokens, we achieved 72% agreement on the type of ex-plicit connective that best conveyed the interpretation ofthe implicit connective.For the argument annotations of the implicit connec-tives, we present agreement results from using the firstdiagnostic used for the explicit connectives.
That is, wecounted ARG1 and ARG2 annotations as independent to-kens and computed percent agreement using the exactmatch criterion.
On the 772 ARG1 and ARG2 tokens,we achieved 85.1% (657/772) agreement between 2 an-notators.
The analysis of the 115 disagreements is givenin Table 4.
Note that here again, the number of disagree-ments reduces to half using the partial match measure forthe parenthetical and dependent clause classes, giving us92.6% agreement overall.DISAGREEMENT TYPE No.

Initially, we also considered a group of con-nectives expressing hypothetical relations but no such connec-tives were identified in the annotations.11Some polysemous connectives such as ?while?
and ?in fact?appeared in more than one group.5 SummaryIn this paper we presented a new and innovativediscourse-level annotation project, the Penn DiscourseTreeBank (PDTB), in which discourse connectives andtheir arguments are annotated, thereby defining a clearlevel of discourse structure that can be reliably annotatedfor a large corpus.
Our inter-annotator results confirm ourexpectations of high agreement and annotation reliability.At a later stage of the project, we plan to provide seman-tic characterizations of the arguments of connectives andresolve any cases of polysemy that might arise.AcknowledgmentsWe are very grateful to Tom Morton and Jeremy Lacivitafor the development and special modification of theWordFreak annotation tool.
