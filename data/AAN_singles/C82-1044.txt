Inth i s  model,  the lambda formula obta ined  from the syntact i cand Semantic analysis of a source language sentence is viewedas a target language generating function and the targetlanguage sentence is obtained as a result of evaluating theformula by functional application or ~-calculus.
This modelprovides a systematic and powerful way of incorporating humanknowledge on the languages.
A prototype is constructed on theLISP system.
The performance was tested for four sample textstaken from existing technical reports and computer manuals.INTRODUCTIONThis paper proposes a functional model of machine translation and describes itsapplcation to English-Japanese machine translation.
In this model, we aimedto achieve:- systematization of translation process,- lexicon based autonomous framework, and- a translation model based on semantic interpretation.INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONIntermediate representation of this model is EFR (English-oriented FormalRepre~entatlon) and CPS (Conceptual Phrase Structure).EFR is a logical language based on Cresswell's lambda eategorial language(Cresswell (1973)), which can be considered to be a notationally simplifiedversion of Montague Grammar (Montague (1974), Dowry (1981)).
From anengineering point of view, EFR can be regarded as an artiflcial language inwhich each expression is unambiguous.
So, there may be the cases in whichmore than one EFR expression can be associated with a given sentence.
Insuch cases, ambiguities are resolved using inference, knowledge, or by humanassistance.CPS is an extended phrase structure in that (I) CPS is a more general elementincluding syntactic knowledge on the concept, so (2) CPS is implemented as aframo and (3) CPS is not only a data structure which is an object underoperation but also a function which can operate on other CPS's.A CPS formula is a functional notation (lambda formula) of the operationsequence on CPS's.
A CPS formula is evaluated to be a CPS or a functionalva lue .

Such process ings  make thecomputer very much slow and ine f f i c ient .

Thehuman halp is limited to resolving ambiguities.
In order to make the humandiagnosis efficient, some diagnostic facilities are implemented.It is also important to construct and manage dictionaries.
Dictionary manageris implemented to make human modification of dictionary flexible by use ofpattern directed dictionary editing commands.INTERPRETATION OF EFR AND TARGET LANGUAGE GENERATIONThe interpretation of an EFR expression can be defined in the conceptual level.For example, given an EFR expression:a(%y\[a*(communication))(~x\[(((*ap(for)(x))(facility))(y)\])\]),which corresponds to a noun phrase "a facility for communication".
A detaileddescription of the conceptual interpretation in our conceptual model (Nishida(1980)) is given below.
(I) conceptual interpretation of a(~y\[ ... \]) associates a conceptualelement "something" (individual concept) with the variable y.
(2) conceptual interpretation of a*(communication)(~x\[ ... \]) associates aconceptual element "(a) communication" with the variable x.
(3) (*ap(for))(x) is interpreted as an adjective concept "for the sake of x",which becomes "for the sake of (a) communication" from (2).
(4) the adjective concept obtained in (3) is applied as a function to theinterpretation of "facility" (i.e., a noun concept "facility").
Thuswe obtain a complex noun concept "system for the sake of (a) facility"for ((*ap(for))(x))(facility).
(5) the application of a noun concept p to an individual concept q yields asentence concept: "q is a p." This interpretation rule is used for thefragment: (((*ap(for))(x))(facility))(y).
The result is a sentenceconcept: "something (y) is a facility for the sake of (a) communication.
"(6) Finally the interpretation of a given EFR expression results in a nounphrase concept: "something y: such that y is a facility for the sake of(a) communication."
This noun phrase concept is a higher order conceptwhich gives a name to an individual: "a facility for the sake of (a)co~m~unication."
This higher order concept will be reduced if it isapplied to a one place predicate (roughly speaking, a property like"being constructed", "being an x such that the paper is concerned withx", etc.
).The above process of interpretation is stepwise and includes no "gap" nor"skip".
Such property is crucially important i n constructing large and complexsystems including machine translation systems.
This process can be simulatedin the "linguistic" domain; our idea of target language generation is this:- each conceptual element is accompanied with a target language phrasestructure which gives the name of the concept.- each semantic interpretation of a complex structure is accompanied with asyntactic operation of creating new phrase structure from those for functionpart and argument part conceptual elements.Two types  of  Japanese  phrase  s t ructure  man ipu la t ing  ru le  can  be assoc ia tedw i th  funct iona l  app l i ca t ion :- embedding one phrase  in to  another  phrase  as a mod i f i ca t ion  par t  (generateKAKARI-UKE relation)- transforming one phrase by use of the information from another phrase.280 T.

Outl ine of a sample generation from an EFR expression.Thus, a functional application corresponds to a primitive syntactic operationof Japanese language.CPS is defined to be a structure which conveys not only conceptual informationon a concept but also syntactic infbrmation about the concept.
All thoseinformation is structured as a frame.
The descendant slot of a CPS is eithera terminal value (lexicon frame) or a list of CPS's.
Thus CPS can be linked asa tree structure.
A CPS corresponding to a noun phrase: "the typewriter"looks like:\[NP \[DET 'the' with Q=DEFINITE\]r 'typewriter' with CLASS=PHYSOBJ \] with NBR=SGL \].

.A CPS works both as a data and as a function; it is sometimes applied to otherCPS's to result in another CPS or functional value, or it sometimes is a datastructure under some operation.
Thus CPS is a higher order object.
Thesemantics can be modeled in the notion of a categorial grammar.
A CPS of anadjective concept, for example, meps a CPS of a noun concept into another(compound) CPS of a modif ied noun.
This principle can he written as:ADJ=NOUN/NOUN.
On the other hand, the adjective CPS can be modified by anadverbial CPS.
Thus ADV=ADJ/ADJ.A CPS formula specifies a seqfience of operations on given CPS's.
A CPS formulainvolves CPS as a data.
Other elements of CPS formula are: variable (withAN ENGLISH-.IAPANESE MACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEM 281coers ion  spec i f i ca t ion)~ lambda express ion ,  funct iona l  app l i ca t ion  fo rmula ,t rans format lona l  ru les ,  cond i t iona l  express ion ,  and compos i t ion  funct ion .

About two years since the lastCOLING conference at Tokyo were mainly devoted to the development.At the first stage of experiment, sample sentences were tested for severalsentence patterns.
At the second stage, our purpose was to extend the systemfor practical test; to translate existing texts even if introducing humanassists to some (reasonable) extent.
Four sample texts (totally 40 sentences)selected from existing technical reports and computer menuals.
Each of thes ~le texts orresponds to one section or a short chapter in the material.
Alls ences of each sample texts have been successfully translated into Japanese.No pre-editing is done except for three minor modifications to the originaltext (e.g., "16- or 32- bit" => "16-bit or 32-bit").
Human assist is limitedto resolving ambiguities in the analysis phase.
One example is shown in Fig.2.CONCLUSIONThis paper proposes a new approach to machine translation based on a functionalsemantics of natural langauge.
The effectiveness of this approach is testedby exper i~nts for short chapters and an abstract taken from existing technicalreports and computer menuals.ACKNOWLEGDEMENTThis research was partially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research.The authors want to thank Mr. Kiyoshi Agusa and Mr. Shigeo Sugimoto forproviding conveniences of editing and printing this material.REFERENCES\[I\] Cresswell, M.J., Logics and Languages, (Methuen, 1973).\[2\] Davis, R., Meta-rules: reasoning about control, AI 15 (1980), 179-222.\[3\] Dosbita~ S., Hiramatsu, K.j and Kakui, K.j Implementation of LISP system282 T.
