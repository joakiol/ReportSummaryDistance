ukAbstractLittle notice has been taken of punctu-ation in the field of natural languageprocessing, chiefly due to the lackof any coherent theory on which tobase implementations.
Some work hasbeen carried out concerning punctu-ation and parsing, but much of itseems to have been rather ad-hoc andperformance-motivated.
This paperdescribes the first step towards theconstruction of a theoretically-motivatedaccount of punctuation.
Parsed corporaare processed to extract punctuationpatterns, which are then checked andgeneralised to a small set of GeneralPunctuation Rules.
Their usage isdiscussed, and suggestions are made forpossible methods of including punctu-ation information in grammars.1 In t roduct ionItitherto, the field of punctuation has been almostcompletely ignored within Natural LanguageProcessing, with perhaps the single exceptionof the sentence-final full-stop (period).
Thereason for this non-treatment has been the lackof any coherent heory Of punctuation on whicha computational treatment could be based.
Asa result, most contemporary s stems imply stripout punctuation i  input text, and do not put anymarks into generated texts.Intuitively, this s~ems very wrong, since punctu-ation is such an integral part of many writtenlanguages.
If text in the real world (a newspaper,for example) were to appear without any punctu-ation marks, it would appear very stilted,ambiguous or infantile.
Therefore it is likely thatany computational system that ignores these extratextual cues will suffer a degradation in perfor-mance, or at the very least a great restriction inthe class of linguistic data it is able to process.Several studies have already shown thepotential for using punctuation within NLP.
Dale(1991) has shown the positive benefits of usingpunctuation ill the fields of discourse structureand semantics, suggesting that it can be used toindicate degrees of rhetorical balance and aggre-gation between juxtaposed elements, and also thatin certain cases a punctuation mark can determinethe rhetorical relations that hold between twoelements.In the field of syntax Jones (1994) has shown,through a comparison of the performance of agrammar that uses punctuation and one whichdoes not, that for the more complex sentencesof real language, parsing with a punctuatedgrammar yields around two orders of magnitudefewer parses than parsing with an nnpunctuatedgrammar, and that additionally the punctuatedparses better reflect the linguistic structure ofthe sentences.
Briscoe and Carroll (1995) extendthis work to show the real contribution thatusage of punctuation can make to the syntacticanalysis of text.
They also point out some funda-mental problems of the approach adopted byJones (1994).If, based on the conclusions of these studies,we are to include punctuation in NLP systemsit is necessary to have some theory upon whicha treatment can be based.
Thus far, the onlyaccount available is that of Nunberg (1990), whichalthough it provides a useful basis for a theory isa little too vague to be used as the basis of' anyimplementation.
In addition, the basic implemen-tation of Nunberg's punctuation linguistics eemsuntenable, certainly on a computational level,since it stipulates that punctuation phenomenashould be treated on a seperate level to the lexicalwords in the sentence (Jones, 1994).
It is also thecase that Nunberg's treatment of punctuation is604too prescriptive to account for, or permit, somephenomena that occur in real language (Jones,:1995).Therefore it is necessary to develop a newtheory of punctuation, that is suitable for compu-tational implementation.
Work has already beencarried out on the variety of punctuation marksand their interaction (Jones, :1995), showingthat whilst tile set of symbols that we conven-tionally regard as punctuation (point punctu-ation, quotation and parenthetical symbols)account for the majority of punctuation in thewritten language (and therefore conld be imple-mented in a standardised way), there is anotherset of more unusual symbols, usually with a highersemantic ontent, which tend to be specific to thecorpus in which they occur and therefore art; lesssuited to a standardised treatment.
This studyalso shows that the average number of punctu-ation symbols to be expected in a sentence ofEnglish is four, thus reinforcing the argumentfor the inclusion of pnnctnation in languageprocessing systems.Tile next step towards the devek)pnmnt of atheory of punctuation is the study of the inter-action of punctuation and the lexical items itseparates, in particular the way that punctu-ation will integrate into grammars and syntax.The major problem of the ewduatory studies,(Dale (199l), Jones (1994), and to a far lesser:extent Briscoe & Carroll (1995)), was that theircoverage and use of pun<:tuation was rather poor,being necessarily based on human intuitions andpossible idiosyncrasies.
What is needed thereforeis a proper investigation into the syntactic rolesthat punctuation symbols can play, and a tbrmal-isation of these into instructions for the inclusionof punctuation in N\]+ grammars.2 Data  Co l lec t ionThe best data sources are parsed corpora.
Usingthese ensures a wide range of language is covered;since they are hand-parsed or checked tile parsewill be (nominally) correct; and since there aremany parsers/editors no individual's intuitions oridiosyncrasies will dominate.
The set of parsedcorpora is sadly very small but still suI\[icient toyield useflfl results.The corpus chosen was the Dow Jones section ofthe Penn rlYeebank (size: 1.95 million words).
Thebracketings were analysed so that each 'node' thathas a puuctu~ttion mark as its imme(liate daughteris reported, with its other daughters abbreviatedto their categories, as in.
( i ) -  (3).
(1) \[NP \[NP the following\] : \] ==~ \[Ne = NP :\](2) \[S \[PP In Edinburgh\] , \[s ...\] ==ee\[s = m' , s\](3) \[NP \[NP Bob\] , \[NP .
.
.)
, \] ==4> \[NP = NP , NP , \]In this fashion each sentence was broken downinto a set of such category-patterns, resulting in aset of different categoryq)atterns for each punctu-ation symbol.
These sets were then processed byhand to extract the underlying rule patterns fromthe raw category-patterns since these will includeinstances of serial repetition (4) and lexical 'break-through' in cases where phrases are not marked inthe original corpus (5).
(4) \[NP = NP ,  NP , NP , NP or NP\](5) \[NP :-= each project , or activity pp\]These underlying rule-patterns represent all theways that punctuation behaves in this corpus, andare good indicators of how the punctuation marksmight behave in the rest of language.
In the nextsections we try to generalise these rule-patternsand discuss their possible implementation.3 Exper imenta l  Resu l tsThere were 12,700 unique category-patternsextracted fl:om the corpus for the live mostcommon marks of point punctuation, rangingfrom 9,320 for tile comma to 425 for the dash.These rules were then redu<'e<l to just lgZ under-lying rule-patterns ik)r the colon, seinicolon, dash,comma, full-stop.Even some of these underlying rule-patterns,however, are questionable since their incidenceis very low (maybe once in the whole corpus)or their: form is so linguistically strange so as to(:all into doubt their correctness (possibly idiosyn-cratic mis-parses), as in (6).
((3) \[ADVI'-'= P I ' ,  NP\]Therefore all the patterns were= checked againstthe original corpus to recover the originalsentences.

The only real underlyingpatterns are those in table 2.The rest of the rule-patterns were eliminatedbecause they represented idiosyncratic brack-etings and category assignments in the originalcorpus, and so were covered by other rules.
Itshould also be noted that some incorrect categoryassignments were made at the earlier data analysisstages, which explains why several of the revisedrules have non-phrasal-level left-most daughters.Here are some examples of the inappropriate rulepatterns.?
S :NP :S  - -  inappropriate because the mothercategory should really be NP.
Instancesof this pattern in the corpus (7) are nodifferent to instances of the similar rule witha NP mother and the pattern is more suitedto a nominal interpretation.
The problemhas arisen in this case through confilsion ofsentential and top categories in the grammar.Ahnost all items in the corpus are markedas sentences, although not all fulfil thatgrammatical role.

Sincesome of the pal;terns only el)ply in particular,exceptional cases, the uulnl)er of 'standar(t' rulesis reduced even tim;her.
Also, since many validrule-patterns occur infrequently in the corpus,there exists the possibility that there are furthervalid infrequent pmlctuation patterns that donot occur in the corpus.
Whilst some of thesemay be hyl)othesized , and incorporated it,to aformalisation, other more obscure pat;terns maybe missed, and so the guidelines postulated in thispaper are not necessarily exhaustiw, for the wholelanguage.4 l~ormal i smIf the exceptional cases are ignored, it is relativelystraightforward to postulate some generalisationsabout the use of the wu:ious punctuation marks.
(',()loll expansions seem only to occur indescriptive contexts.
Thus their mother categorycan be either NP or s, descriptive c~ttegories, ratherthan the active vl'  or locative l'p.
The mothercategory of a colon expansion is always the s~uJmas the category to which the adjunct is a.ttachod(the lel't-n,ost d:mghter) and this is even t.rueof many of the exceptional rule patterns if theconstraint is relaxed to allow the daughter to haw~a lower bar-level.
The phrase contained within thecolon-exl)ansion (right-most daughter) nnlst alsobe descriptive, but can be AI) JP in addition toNP and s. (Although there was no rule patternfound in the corpus that had all adjectival colonexpansion with a sentential mother-category, it;is certainly possible to imagine such a sentence(16).)

Thus thegeneralisation i (19) is the most appropriate.

.The dash interpolation is the first punctuationmark for which generalisation becomes slightlycomplicated.
There appear to be two generalrules, which overlap slightly.
The first (20) simplystates that a dash interpolation can contain anidentical category to the phrase it follows.
Thesecond rule (21) extends this rule when appliedto the two descriptive categories, so that a widerrange of categories are permitted within theinterpolation again, one of the rule-patternspermitted by (21) does not actually occur in thecorpus, but does seem plausible.
Note that sincethese rules incorporate a final dash, they will relyon Nunberg's (1990) principle of point absorptionto delete the final dash if necessary.

The generMisation seems to be thatally combination of phrasal categories is OK, solong as one of the daughter categories is identicalto the mother category (22a&b).
The restrictionon this, and the reason why there are fewer rule-patterns for categories such as  pP,  ADJP andADW', is that rules with the same daughters butmore 'powerful' mother categories (e.g.
sententialvs.
adverbial) seem to be able to block the appli-cation of the 'less powerful' rules.

l /V :  *5 Implementat ion  Methodo logyThe issue now arises of the best way to integratepunctuation into a NL grammar.
There are threeexisting hypotheses to choose from.
The theoryof Nunberg (1990) is that punctuation should betreated in a 'text grammar '  on a separate level tothe lexical grammar.
However, as pointed out byJones (1994), it is difficult to see how this wouldbe feasible in practice and there is little linguisticor psychological motivation for such a separationof lexicM text and punctuation.Therefore Jones (1.994) fully integrates punctu-ation and lexicM grammar, and in effect treatspunctuation marks as clitics on words, intro-ducing additional features into normal syntacticrules (27).
riseoe and Carroll (190 ), however,point out that this rnM~es it hard to extract anindependant text grammar or introduce modularsemantics.
Therefore their grammar keeps thepunctuation and part-of-speech rules separate,but still allows them to be applied in an inter-leaved manner, in effect finding the happy mediuinbetween the two extreme approaches.
Hence,additionally, their rules include the punctuationmarks as distinct entities, rather than cliticisingthem, although they still require extra features toensure proper application of the rules (28).
(27) rip\[st S\] np\[st c\] np\[ t S\]'(28) V2\[wn-,1NV -\] -+H2\[WlI-,HN +,-ta\] -I-pco 2 VI\[vFORM IN(l\]The most appropriate method would seem tobe a combination of the two integrated methodsabove, combining their modularity, flexibility andpower.
Thus the Generalised Punctuation Rulesobtained above could be encoded into a normalsyntactic grammar to add punctuation capabil-ities.
However, this will Mrnost certainly resultin overgeneration of parses, as tile rules are stilltoo flexible: they accurately describe syntacticsituations where punctuation Call occur, but failto place any constraints upon those situations.Itence some further theoretical work seems to berequired to constrain the applicability of theserules.The main location for punctuation marks islikely to be with phrasal-level items, whether themarks occur before a particular phrasal item orafter it.
Punctuation does not seem to occurat levels below the phrasal, with one exception:punctuation is allowed to occur at any level inthe context of coordination.
Thus (29) representsl g represents a variable2 +pco represents a comma608legal use of punctuation adjoining a I)hrasal itemsince it occurs adjacent o the AD.n' within theNP.
However, in (30) there is no phrasal item forthe punctuation to attach to, and so its use isunsanctioned.
Conjunctive punctuation use canbc seen in (31), where although occurring belowthe level of NP, the pnnctuation is legal becauseof its eonjmmtive context.
(29) The green, more turquoise actually, bicycle ...(30) * The, bicycle is a joy to ride.
(31) The shark, whale and dolphin can all swim.To generalise, then, l)unctuation seems to haveadjunctive and conjunctive functions, and thetheoretical formalisation of these function willform a good method of constraining the l)arsesproduced with the Generalised Rules above.6 ConclusionWe have seen that by extracting punctuationpatterns from a corpus it has been possibleto postulate a small number of generalisationsfor punctuation rules within NL grammars.
Asuitable methodology for applying tmnctuation toexisting grammars has also been suggested.
Sincemany of the rule patterns eem to have a w'xy lowfrequency of occurrence it may also be useflfl tocollect such frequencies and use them in the rulegeneralisations to attach probabilities to variousrule expansions.
We have also seen that the rulepatterns we extracted fi'om the corpora agreed toa large extent with the descriptions of punctuationuse found in publishers' style-guides, suggestingthai; reference to these may be usefnl.What is needed now is a thorough testing andevaluation of the suggestions made in this paper,both against lmnctuation patterns from othercorpora and in parsing novel material, to maybesuggest better geimralisations.
'Fheu the next steptowards a theory of punctuation can be carriedout, namely the analysis of punctuation for itssemantic flmction and content.My regards to the international academic andresearch comnmnity in the field of ComputationalLinguistics: thank-you, and good-bye!ReferencesEdward Briscoe.
