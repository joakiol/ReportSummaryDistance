Integration of Speech and Natural Language Understandingfor Spoken Language Systems (SLS)Patti PriceSRI InternationalOBJECTIVESSRI is developing a multi-modal interface to an air travel database that will permit cooperative planning viainteractive human-machine problem solving.
The project goals are real-time, large vocabulary (3000words), high semantic accuracy (90%), speaker-independent understanding of spontaneously spokennatural language in a restricted domain.
The grammar should be shown to be habitable and the systemshould be robust to individual differences in dialect and speaking style.
The design should be easilyportable to a variety of applications.RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS?
Demonstrated the feasibility of a unique frame-level integration of speech and natural language whichpermits independent development and, computationally efficient, integrated application of constraintsfrom phonetics through semantics,?
Developed a phonological rule set with high coverage and low overcoverage that when combined withalgorithms developed under the Real Time Speech Recognition contract improved performance for bothspeaker-independent and speaker-dependent recognition,?
Incorporated techniques (developed under an NSF grant) that use statistical information about thespeech signal and the noise to improve recognition accuracy in noisy environments,?
Shown the feasibility of integrating prosodic information (e.g., duration models developed under aDARPA-NSF contract) in the grammar-parser,?
Collected, transcribed, and analyzed over 8 hours of human-human air travel dialogues for use invocabulary estimates and initial system design,?
Acquired the Official Airline Guide Database; implemented it in a relational non-proprietary form deliveredto TI; created an initial SLS simulation; used it to collect 88 air travel planning dialogues which have beentranscribed, analyzed and used to design: (a) data collection methods for evaluation of an SLS kernel,and (b) a more complex multi-modal interactive interface in the air travel planning domain.PLANS?
Port the syntax from the resource management domain to the air travel planning domain; incorporatedomain-specific semantics for the air travel planning domain,?
Begin integration of phonology, syntax, semantics, and prosody for accurate modeling of spontaneousspeech; statistical modeling of linguistic relationships that can control perplexity and maintain habitability,?
Continue coordination with related contracts where appropriate,?
Collect and analyze more human-machine data under various conditions in order to guide the design andevaluation of the SRI SLS.457
