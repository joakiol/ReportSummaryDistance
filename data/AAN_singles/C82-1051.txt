AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH TOWORD SEMANTICS FOR ANALOGICAL INEERENCINGBurgbard B. RiegerMESY-Group, German DepartmentTechnical University of AachenGermanyNatural language understanding systems make use of languageand/or worldknowledge bases.
One of the salient problemsof meaning representation and knowledge structure is themodelling of its acquisition and modification from naturallanguage processing.
Based upon the statistical analysis ofdiscourse, a formal representation of vague word meanings isderived which constitutes the lexical structure of the voca-bulary employed in the texts as a fragment of the connotativeknowledge conveyed in discourse.
It consists of a distance-like data structure of linguistically labeled space pointswhose positions give a prototype-representation of conceptualmeanings.
On the basis of these semantic space data an algo-rithm is presented which transforms prevailing similaritiesof conceptual meanings as denoted by adjacent space pointsto establish a binary, non-symmotric, and transitive relationbetween them.
This allows for the hierarchical reorganizationof points as nodes dependent on a head in a binary tree ca l ledconnotative dependency structure (CDS\].
It offers an empiri-cally founded operational approach to determine relevant port-ions of the space structure constituting semantic dispositionswhich the priming of a meaning point will trigger with de-creasing criteriality.
Thus, the CDS allows for the executionof associatively guided search strategies, contents-orientedretrieval operations, and source-dependent processes of ana-logical inferencing.INTRODUCTIONIn procedural approaches of linguistic semantics, cognitive psycho-logy and artificial intelligence, natural language understandingsystems make use of language and/or world knowledge bases.
Definedas lexical structures, memory models or semantic networks, theyare formatted according to whatever representational, explanatoryor inferential purpose a particular simulation of processes and/orof understanding was aiming at (I).
~he language and world knowledgeembodied in these systems, however, is restricted under two aspects:most of it is obtained introspectively and as such not warranted byany operational means or, whenever it seems to, these operations arenot the permitting condition for, but a performiffg result of simplereferencing in clear-cut environments.Based mainly upon the investigatorS' or the system designers' own orsome consulted experts' linguistic competence and/or world knowledgein a subject domain, the data considered semantically relevant to beorganized in referential and/or conceptual structures (lists, arrays,networks, topologies, etc.)
have a more or less ad hoc character andare confined to representing logically reconstructable propositions.319320 B.B.

But it is much harder to dothis for feelings, insights and understandings, with all the atti-tudes, dispositions, and 'ways of seeing things' that go with them.\[The term 'disposition' is used here in its ordinary languagesense to mean 'a momentary range of possible behaviours'\]) Tradi-tionally, such issues are put aside, with the excuse that we shouldunderstand simpler things first.
But what if feelings and view-points a r e the simpler things - the elements of which theothers are composed?
Then, I assert, we should deal with disposi-tions directly, using a 'structural' approach ... (2)In the present case this has been developed in two stages: the seman-tic space as a distance-like data structure, and an algorithm to trans-form its distance relations to form source-oriented hierarchies ofconnotative dependency structures.SEMANTIC SPACE STRUCTURETheoretical approaches in formal semantics tend to deny a dynamiclinguistic meaning structure, but assume the existence of an externalsystem structure of a world, o~ possible worlds, whose pre-formattedentities may referentially be related to language terms constitutingtheir denotation.
Structural approaches in linguistic semantics tendto deny the possibil ity of denotational, but presuppose the knowledge(and comprehension) of language systems whose semantic relations amongtheir items are being described intra-lingually by means of syntag-matic and paradigmatic oppositions along certain dimensions in seman-tic fields.
Other than these two, our present way of approach strivesto presuppose as little and to reconstruct empirically as much aspossible of the relational (not necessarily logically reconstructable)structure that in the course of discourse is constituted by the regu-lar use of language terms as a system of l inguistically labeled em-pirical objects, called meanings.We consider the natural language users' ability to intend and compre-hend meanings in verbal interaction a phenomenologically undoubtable,empirically well established, and theoretically defensible basis forany semantic study of natural language performance.
It is assumedthat the usage regularities followed and/or established by employingdifferent lexical items differently for communicative purposes indiscourse may be analysed not only to describe the lexical structureof vocabulary items used, but also to model a fragment of the con-EMPIRICAL APPROACH TO WORD SEMANTICS FOR ANALOGICAL INFERENCING 321comitantly conveyed common knowledge or semantic memory structureconstituted.This is achieved by an algorithm that takes lemmatized strings ofnatural language disc6urse of a certain domain as input and producesas output a distance-like data structure of linguistically labeledpoints whose positions represent their meanings.
As the statisticalmeans for the empirical analysis of prevailing interdependencies bet-ween lexical items in text strings have elsewhere (3) been developedand discussed to some extent (4) 9 and as the formal representationof vague word meanings derived from these analyses has previously (5)been outlined and illustrated~ too (6), an informal description willsuffice here.The algorithm applied so far consists of a consecutive mapping oflexical items onto fuzzy subsets of the vocabulary according to thenumerically specified statistical regularities and the differences~these items have been used with in the discourse analysed.
The re-sulting system of sets of fuzzy subsets may be interpreted topologi-cally as a n-dimensional hyperspace with a natural metric.
Its nlinguistically labeled elements (representing meaning points) andtheir mutual distances (representing meaning differences) form dis-cernable clouds and clusters (7).
These determine the overall struc-turedness of a domain by measurable semantic (paradigmatic and/orsyntagmatic) properties of the lexical items concerned.CONNOTATIVE DEPENDENCY STRUCTUREStimulated by the theory of spreading activation in memory models (8)in conjunction with the psyhhological account of language understand-ing in procedural semantics (9) a dynamic meaning representation canbe developed of the basis of the prototypical, but static represen-tations provided by the semantic hyperspace strucure.
This is mchiev-ed by a recursively defined algorithm which has formally been intro-duced elsewhere (Io) so that it may verbally be described here as aprocedure to generate a potential of latent relations among meaningpoints in the semantic space.In a way9 this procedure reconstructs for this model what recenttheories of cognition and language comprehension have introduced innetwork models of semantic memory: paths of excitation that may beactivated from any primed node and which spread along node relatinglinks over the whole network with decreasing intensities.
Comparedto the execution of spreading activation processes in network models~however, the present procedure - speaking in model genetical terms -must be considered of prior status.
The semantic hyperspace is not atransitively related network of nodes, but a symmetrically relateddata structure of linguistically labeled n-tuples of numerical values.Therefore, priming of any item would immediately activate every otheritem rendering the process of spreading activation undiscriminatingfor semantic representation.
So, the new procedure, first, has toestablish links between items and evaluate them by processing thedata base provided in order to let these links eventually serve asdirected paths along which possible activation might spread.Operating on the distance-like data of the semantic space, the al-gorithm's generic procedure will start with any meaning point beingprimed to determine those two other points, the sum of distances bet-ween which form a triangle of minimum edges' lengths.
Repeated success-ively for each of these meaning points listed and in turn primed inaccordance with this procedure, particular fragments of the relationalstructure inherent in the semantic space will be selected dependingon the aspect, i.e.
the primed point the algorithm is initially startedwith.
Working its way through and consuming all labeled points in thespace system, the procedure transforms prevailing similarities of322 B.B.

For the effective usein procedural meaning representation and son, an-tic Drocessing~ the CDS-trees may additional-ly be evaluated by connotative c~iterialities(1o).
The criteriaiity is a numerical express-ion of the degree or intensity by whicb anyCOS-node is dependent on the head; c%!cula~edas ~ funhtion both of the involved meaningpoints ~ topology and their relative distaDc~sin the semantic space?
The head's criteriality being I.Oo~ this valueis splitted among every two dependent nodes~ and consequently decreasesfrom level to level in the tree structure approximating O.Examples of connotative dependency trees are given below where theupper fragments of the COSts of ARBEIT/labour (Fig.4) and INDUSTRIE/industry (Fig.
5) are shown as computed from the semantic space shruc-ture derived of a sample of German newspaper texts from the 1964 dailyeditions of 'Die Welt'It goes without saying that the generating of CDS-trees is a prerequi-sit to source-oriented search and retrieval procedures which may thusbe performed effectively on the semantic space structure.
Given, say~the meaning point ARBEIT/!abour to be primed, ands say~ INDUSTRIE/in-dustry as the target point to be searched~ the COS (ARBEIT) wiT~ begenerated first.
It provides semantic dispositions of decreasing lri-teriality under the aspect of ARBEIT in ~he semantic space data.
