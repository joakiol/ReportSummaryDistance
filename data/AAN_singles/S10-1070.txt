A systems for recognizing andnormalizing TIMEX3Estela SaqueteNatural Language Processing and Information System GroupUniversity of Alicantestela@dlsi.ua.esAbstractThe system described in this paper has par-ticipated in the Tempeval 2 competition,specifically in the Task A, which aim isto determine the extent of the time expres-sions in a text as defined by the TimeMLTIMEX3 tag, and the value of the fea-tures type and val.
For this purpose, acombination of TERSEO system and theT2T3 Transducer was used.
TERSEO sys-tem is able to annotate text with TIDESTIMEX2 tags, and T2T3 transducer per-forms the translation from this TIMEX2tags to TIMEX3 tags.1 IntroductionIdentification and extraction of explicit and im-plicit temporal information has become a very im-portant field of research within the computationallinguistics area since some years ago (Allen, 1983)(Allen, 1984).
Moreover, a large number of NLPapplications are exploiting this extracted informa-tion, such as question answering and summariza-tion systems, allowing these applications to per-form in a more complex level.When dealing with temporal information iden-tification and normalization, different approachescan be taken, depending on the available resourcesof the target language and the requirements of thesystem being developed.
The most extended ap-proaches to the problem are: a) rule-based ap-proaches, such as Chronos (ITC-irst): recognizesand normalizes temporal expressions in Englishand Italian (Negri, 2007); TERSEO (University ofAlicante, the system used for this work): a knowl-edge based system for Spanish that has been auto-matically extended to other languages, such as En-glish, Italian and Catalan (Saquete et al, 2006), b)machine learning approaches, such as TimexTag(University of Amsterdam): applies data-drivenmethods for recognition and normalization tasks(Ahn et al, 2005) (Ahn, 2006); CU-TMP (Uni-versity of Colorado): uses machine learning forautomatic annotation (Bethard and Martin, 2007),and c) mixed combination of rules and ML ap-proaches, such as, TempEx (MITRE Corpora-tion): combines hand-coded patterns with ma-chine learning rules to tag documents (TempEx,2008) (Mani and Wilson, 2000); TARSQI (Bran-deis University): currently uses GUTime (2008)for temporal expression annotation, which extendsthe capabilities of the TempEx tagger while gener-ating TIMEX3 annotations (Verhagen et al, 2005).However, whatever the approach, the output ofthese systems is a standardized annotation scheme.The most popular annotation schemes areTIDES (Mani et al, 2001) and TimeML (Puste-jovsky et al, 2003b).
TIDES program followedthe efforts started in the context of the MessageUnderstanding Conference, MUC (1998), and de-fined the TIMEX2 tag, with the goal of interpret-ing temporal expressions within a normalized rep-resentation of the times they denote, adopting theISO 8601 standard (Technical Committee ISO/TC154, 2004).
In 2004, within the ACE program, theTime Expression Recognition and Normalization(TERN, 2004) evaluation workshop was held, re-quiring by the participation systems to detect andnormalize the temporal expressions mentioned inthe source data, according to the TIDES annota-tion standard 1.
In spite of the widespread useof this annotation scheme within NLP researchers,it is necessary to identify other types of tempo-ral information such as events or the relations be-tween events and temporal expressions.
Motivatedby such considerations, the TimeML annotationscheme (Pustejovsky et al, 2003a) (Pustejovsky etal., 2005) (Lee et al, 2007) was developed, speci-fying four major data structures (elements) for an-1http://fofoca.mitre.org/annotation guidelines/2005 timex2standard v1.1.pdf317notation: EVENT, TIMEX3, SIGNAL and LINK(Pustejovsky et al, 2005).2 System DescriptionThe system presented in this paper is a combi-nation of two separated systems.
First of all,TERSEO system, which is a knowledge-basedsystem for Spanish automatically extended to En-glish, performs an identification and normaliza-tion of all the temporal expressions in the text, an-notating them with TIMEX2 tags.
Once the texthas been annotated with TIMEX2, the T2T3 trans-ducer applies a set of translation rules to convertthis TIMEX2 output to a TIMEX3 output.2.1 Description of TERSEO systemTERSEO system first implementation used ahand-made knowledge database in Spanish.
How-ever, our main goal was the possibility of workingwith TERSEO on a multilingual level, but buildingthe different knowledge databases for the new lan-guages through the automatic acquisition of rules(Negri et al, 2006).
Therefore, it is possible tocreate a multilingual system with no need of a pre-vious knowledge of the other languages to whichTERSEO system is going to be extended.
For thispurpose, an architecture similar to the one used byEuroWordNet (Vossen, 2000) was implemented,in order to obtain knowledge databases for thedifferent languages, but all of them connectedthough a unit denominated TER-ILI or TemporalExpression Rules Interlingua Index.
In doing that,TERSEO system have a new knowledge databasefor each new language and is able to solve any ex-pression in this language.
Besides, the system iseasily extensible to other new languages.
The out-put of TERSEO system is following the guidelinesof TIDES annotation scheme.This system participated in TERN2004 for En-glish, obtaining the results shown in Table 1.It is important to consider the results of the sys-tem annotating TIMEX2 tags, due to the fact thatthe final results after the translation depends onhow correct the annotation was made by TERSEO.2.2 Description of T2T3 TransducerThe T2T3 Transducer, developed by Universityof Alicante and Brandeis University, implementsan automatic mapping between TIDES annotationscheme and TimeML, only in English in a firststep.
This mapping is performed applying a setof rules in two steps:?
Step 1: Rules for the adaptation of theextent: the temporal expression extent isadapted from TIMEX2 to TIMEX3.
The ex-tension of the expression is related to recog-nition of the expression.
Most expressionswhich are considered as markable in TIDESare also considered as markable in TimeML.However, TimeML differs from TIDES withrespect to the tag span in some cases.
There-fore, following the outline of both TIDES2005 guidelines2 and TimeML 1.2.1 guide-lines3, a mapping is performed in order toproperly adapt the TIMEX2 extent to theTIMEX3 extent.
Besides, all the possibleadaptations from one scheme to the other areclustered in a set of transformation rules.?
Step 2: Rules for the transformation ofthe attributes: TIMEX2 attributes are trans-formed to TIMEX3 attributes.
The attributesare related to normalization of the expres-sion.
The transducer has one rule for eachTimeML TIMEX3 attribute, extracting andcombining the information provided by theTIMEX2 attributes of each temporal expres-sion.
In Tempeval 2 competition only typeand val attributes are considered.
Therefore,only these two transformation rules are pre-sented here:?
Attribute type: The Type Assignmentrule defines the following steps:1.
If the <TIMEX2> tag has a SET at-tribute which value is ?YES?, thentype="SET" must be added to theTIMEX3 tag.2.
If the VAL attribute of the<TIMEX2> tag starts with ?P?,then type="DURATION" must beadded to the TIMEX3 tag.3.
If the VAL attribute of the<TIMEX2> tag contains a ?T?,then type="TIME" must be addedto the TIMEX3 tag.4.
In any other case, type="DATE"must be added to the TIMEX3 tag.?
Attribute value: The attribute valueis equivalent to the VAL attribute in2Section 5 in TIDES guidelines http://fofoca.mitre.org3Section 2.2.1.2 in TimeML guidelineshttp://www.timeml.org318Tag Precision Recall F-MeasureTIMEX2 0.954 0.786 0.862TIMEX2:ANCHOR DIR 0.818 0.566 0.669TIMEX2:ANCHOR VAL 0.703 0.487 0.575TIMEX2:MOD 0.444 0.111 0.178TIMEX2:SET 0.882 0.455 0.600TIMEX2:TEXT 0.687 0.567 0.621TIMEX2:VAL 0.686 0.709 0.698Table 1: Results obtained by TERSEO in TERN2004 competition for TIMEX2TIMEX2 in most cases.
Therefore, ingeneral, the translation is direct.
How-ever, there is an exception to this rule inthe case of time-anchored expressions.Whereas in TimeML, the value of thehead expression is always a period, ac-cording to TIDES, there are two differ-ent types of time-anchored expressions:a) Anchored point expressions and b)Anchored duration expressions.
There-fore, when the T2T3 transducer detectsone of these anchored point expressions,a special treatment with the TIMEX2 at-tributes is performed in order to obtainthe proper period value.
Moreover, the?DURATION?
type is established forthe expression.3 Evaluation resultsIn this section all the evaluation results for Task Ain English are presented.
Table 2 shows the resultsof the system using the trial corpus provided bythe organization, the results of the system usingthe first delivered training corpus and the wholetraining data, and finally, the score of the systemwith the test corpus.
Accuracy value is not givenin the test results and it can not be calculated fromthe results data provided.As shown in the results of the different evalu-ations, test results are very similar to training re-sults, what means that the system is performingsteadily.
Besides, in the test evaluation, the typeattribute result is the best one obtained, being closeto 100%.
It would be interesting to have the corpusannotated also with TIMEX2 in order to determinewhich errors derive from TERSEO and which er-rors derive from the Transducer.4 ConclusionsOur participation in Tempeval 2 competition wasonly in Task A, due to the fact that the system pre-sented is a extension of TERSEO system, whichonly performs identification and normalization oftemporal expressions generating TIMEX2 annota-tion output.
Events and links are out of the scopeof this system currently.However, our motivation for participating inTempeval 2 competition was the possibility to de-termine the performance of the extension appliedto TERSEO, by means of a transducer that is ableto convert TIMEX2 annotation to TIMEX3, onlyusing the information of the TIMEX2 tags as in-put.
The transducer applies a set of rules, in orderto transform the extent of the temporal expressionaccording to TimeML annotation guidelines, anda set of rules to translate the TIMEX2 attributesto the attributes established by TimeML also.
Itis important to consider that TERSEO system isa knowledge-based system, with hand-made rulesfor Spanish.
These rules were automatically ex-tended to other languages (English is one of them)using only automatic resources and without man-ual revision.
This automatic extension is very in-teresting since it is possible to create a new knowl-edge for the system very fast and with satisfactoryresults.The results of the evaluation of this combination(TERSEO + T2T3 Transducer) are 76% precision,66% recall and 71% F1-Measure.
For the case ofthe attributes, it obtained 98% for type and 65%for value.AcknowledgmentsThis research has been partially supported by theSpanish government, projects TIN-2009-13391-C04-01 and PROMETEO/2009/119.
