Ekman?s six basic emotiontypes have been selected for reliable and semiautomatic word level annotation.
An automaticclassifier has been applied for recognizing sixbasic emotion types for different words in asentence.
Application of different scoringstrategies to identify sentence level emotiontag based on the acquired word level emotionconstituents have produced satisfactory per-formance.1 IntroductionEmotion is a private state that is not open to ob-jective observation or verification.
So, the identi-fication of the emotional state of natural lan-guage texts is really a challenging issue.
Most ofthe related work has been conducted for English.The approach in this paper is to assign emo-tion tags on the Bengali blog sentences with oneof the Ekman?s (1993) six basic emotion typessuch as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surpriseand disgust.
The system consists of two phases,machine learning based word level emotion clas-sification followed by assignment of sentencelevel emotion tags based on the word level con-stituents using sense based scoring mechanism.The classifier accuracy has been measuredthrough confusion matrix.
Corpus based andsense based tag weights have been calculated foreach of the six emotion tags and then these emo-tion tag weights have been used to identify sen-tence level emotion tag.
The tuned referenceranges selected from the development set haveproved effective on the test set.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section 2 describes the related work.
Section 3briefly describes the resource preparation.
Ma-chine learning based word level emotion taggingsystem framework and its evaluation results havebeen discussed in section 4.
Section 5 describesthe calculation of tag weights, sentence levelemotion detection process based on the tagweights, evaluation strategies and results.
Finallysection 6 concludes the paper.2 Related Work(Mishne et al, 2006) used several supervised andunsupervised machine learning techniques onblog data for comparative evaluation.
Importanceof verbs and adjectives in identifying emotionhas been explained in (Chesley et al, 2006).
(Yang et al, 2007) has used Yahoo!
Kimo Blogcorpora containing emoticons associated withtextual keywords to build emotion lexicons.
(Chen et al, 2007) has experimented the emotionclassification task on web blog corpora usingSupport Vector Machine (SVM) and ConditionalRandom Field (CRF) and the observed resultshave shown that the CRF classifiers outperformSVM classifiers in case of document level emo-tion detection.3 Resource PreparationBengali is a less computerized language andthere is no existing emotion word list or Senti-WordNet in Bengali.
The English WordNet Af-fect lists, (Strapparava et al, 2004) based on Ek-man?s six basic emotion types have been updatedwith the synsets retrieved from the English Sen-tiWordNet to have adequate number of emotionword entries.These lists have been converted to Bengali us-ing English to Bengali bilingual dictionary 1 .These six lists have been termed as Emotion lists.A Bengali SentiWordNet is being developed byreplacing each word entry in the synonymous setof the English SentiWordNet (Esuli et al, 2006)1 http://home.uchicago.edu/~cbs2/banglainstruction.html149by its equivalent Bengali meaning using the sameEnglish to Bengali bilingual dictionary.A knowledge base for the emoticons has beenprepared by experts after minutely analyzing theBengali blog data.
Each image link of the emoti-con in the raw corpus has been mapped into itscorresponding textual entity in the tagged corpuswith the proper emotion tags using the knowl-edge base.
The Bengali blog data have been col-lected from the web blog archive(www.amarblog.com) containing 1300 sentenceson 14 different topics and their correspondinguser comments have been retrieved.4 Word Level Emotion ClassificationPrimarily, the word level annotation has beensemi-automatically carried out using Ekman?s sixbasic emotion tags.
The assignment of emotiontag to a word has been done based on the type ofthe Emotion Word lists in which that word is pre-sent.
Other non-emotional words have beentagged with neutral type.
1000 sentences havebeen considered for training of the CRF basedword level emotion classification module.
Rest200 and 100 sentences, verified by language ex-perts to perform evaluation have been consideredas development and test data respectively.4.1 Feature Selection and TrainingThe Conditional Random Field (CRF)(McCallum, 2001) framework has been used fortraining as well as for the classification of eachword of a sentence into the above-mentioned sixemotion tags and one neutral tag.
By manuallyreviewing the Bengali blog data and differentlanguage specific characteristics, 10 active fea-tures have been selected heuristically for ourclassification task.
Each feature value is booleanin nature, with discrete value for intensity featureat the word level.x POS information: We are interested withthe verb, noun, adjective and adverb wordsas these are emotion informative constitu-ents.
For this feature, total 1300 sentenceshas been passed through a Bengali part ofspeech tagger (Ekbal et al 2008) based onSupport Vector Machine (SVM) tech-nique.
The POS tagger was developedwith a tagset of 26 POS tags2, defined forthe Indian languages.
The POS tagger hasdemonstrated an overall accuracy of ap-proximately 90%.2http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL2007/iiit_tagset_guidelines.pdfx First sentence in a topic: It has been ob-served that first sentence of the topic gen-erally contains emotion (Roth et.al., 2005).x SentiWordNet emotion word: A wordappearing in the SentiWordNet (Bengali)contains an emotion.x Reduplication: The reduplicated words(e.g., bhallo bhallo [good good], khokhonokhokhono [when when] etc.)
in Bengali aremost likely emotion words.x Question words: It has been observedthat the question words generally contrib-ute to the emotion in a sentence.x Colloquial / Foreign words: The collo-quial words (e.g., kshyama [pardon] etc.
)and foreign words (e.g.
Thanks, gossya[anger] etc.)
are highly rich with theiremotional contents.x Special punctuation symbols: The sym-bols (e.g.
!, ?, @ etc ) appearing at theword / sentence level convey emotions.x Quoted sentence: The sentences espe-cially remarks or direct speech alwayscontain emotion.x Negative word: Negative words such asna (no), noy (not) etc.

Erroranalysis has been conducted with the help ofconfusion matrix as shown in Table 2.
A closeinvestigation of the evaluation results suggeststhat the errors are mostly due to the uneven dis-tribution between emotion and non-emotion tags.Tags happy   sad   ang     dis    fear  sur    ntrlhappysadangdisfearsurntrl0.01   0.05   0.0    0.0    0.0   0.030.006             0.02   0.03  0.0    0.0   0.020.0       0.03             0.0    0.02  0.0   0.010.0       0.0     0.01            0.01  0.0   0.010.0       0.0     0.0     0.0             0.0   0.010.02     0.007 0.0     0.0    0.0            0.010.0       0.0     0.0     0.0    0.0    0.0Table 2: Confusion matrix for development setThe number of non-emotional or neutral typetags is comparatively higher than other emotionaltags in a sentence.
So, one solution to this unbal-anced class distribution is to split the ?non-emotion?
(emo_ntrl) class into several subclasses.That is, given a POS tagset POS, we generatenew emotion classes, ?emo_ntrl-C?|C?POS.
Wehave 26 sub-classes, which correspond, to non-emotion tags such as ?emo_ntrl-NN?
(commonnoun), ?emo_ntrl-VFM?
(verb finite main) etc.Evaluation results of the system with the inclu-sion of this class splitting technique have shownthe accuracies of 64.65% and 66.74% on the de-velopment and test data respectively.5 Sentence Level Emotion TaggingThis module has been developed to identify sen-tence level emotion tags based on the word levelemotion tags.5.1 Calculation of Emotion Tag weightsSense_Tag_Weight (STW): The tag weight hasbeen calculated using SentiWordNet.
We haveselected the basic six words ?happy?, ?sad?,?anger?, ?disgust?, ?fear?
?surprise?
as the seedwords corresponding to each emotion type.
Thepositive and negative scores in the English Sen-tiWordNet for each synset in which each of theseseed words appear have been retrieved and theaverage of the scores has been fixed as theSense_Tag_Weight of that particular emotion tag.Corpus_Tag_Weight (CTW): This tag weightfor each emotion tag has been calculated basedon the frequency of occurrence of an emotion tagwith respect to the total number of occurrencesof all six types of emotion tags in the annotatedcorpus.Tag Types        CTW                     STWemo_happyemo_sademo_angemo_disemo_fearemo_suremo_ntrl0.5112                     0.01250.2327              ( - ) 0.10220.0959              ( - ) 0.50.1032              ( - ) 0.0750.0465                     0.01310.0371                     0.06250.0                           0.0Table 3: CTW and STW for each of six emotiontags with neutral tag5.2 Scoring TechniquesThe following two scoring techniques dependingon two calculated tag weights (in section 5.1)have been adopted for selecting the best possiblesentence level emotion tags.
(1) Sense_Weight_Score (SWS): Each sen-tence is assigned a Sense_Weight_Score (SWS)for each emotion tag which is calculated by di-viding the total Sense_Tag_Weight (STW)of alloccurrences of an emotion tag in the sentence bythe total Sense_Tag_Weight (STW) of all typesof emotion tags present in that sentence.
TheSense_Weight_Score is calculated asSWSi = (STWi * Ni) / (?
j=1 to 7 STWj * Nj) | i ?
jwhere SWSi is the Sentence levelSense_Weight_Score for the emotion tag i in thesentence and Ni is the number of occurrences ofthat emotion tag in the sentence.
STWi and STWjare the Sense_Tag_Weights for the emotion tags iand j respectively.
Each sentence has been as-signed with the sentence level emotion tag SETifor which SWSi is highest, i.e.,SETi = [max i=1 to 6(SWSi)].
(2) Corpus_Weight_Score (CWS): This meas-ure is calculated in a similar manner by using theCTW of each emotion tag.
The correspondingBengali sentence is assigned with the emotiontag for which the sentence level CWS is highest.The scoring mechanism has been considered forverifying any domain related biasness of emotionand their influence in emotion detection process.1515.3 Evaluation Results of Sentence LevelEmotion TaggingEach sentence in the development and test setshave been annotated with positive or negative orneutral valence and with any of the six emotiontags.
The SWS has been used in identifying va-lence scores as there is no valence informationcarried by CWS.
The sentences for which thetotal SWS produced positive, negative and zero(0) values have been tagged as positive, negativeand neutral type.
Any domain biasness throughCWS has been re-evaluated through SWS also.We have taken the Bengali corpus from comicrelated background.
So, during analysis on thedevelopment set, the CWS outperforms the SWSsignificantly in identifying happy, disgust, fearand surprise sentence level emotion tags.
Theother SETs have been identified through SWS asthe CWS for these SETs are significantly lessthan their corresponding SWS as shown in Table5.
The knowledge and information of the refer-ence ranges (shown in Table 4) of SWS andCWS for assigning valence and six other emotiontags, acquired after tuning of development set,have been applied on the test set.
The valenceand emotion tag assignment process has beenevaluated using accuracy measure on test data.The difference in the accuracies for the develop-ment and test sets is negligible.
It signifies thatthe best possible reference range for valence andother emotion tags have been selected.
Results inTable 5 show that the system has performed sat-isfactorily for valence identification as well asfor sentence level emotion tagging.Table 4: Reference ranges6 ConclusionThe hierarchical ordering of the word level tosentence level and from sentence level to docu-ment level can be considered as the well favoredroute to track the document level emotional ori-entation.
The handling of negative words andmetaphors and their impact in detecting sentencelevel emotion along with document level analysisare the future areas to be explored.Table 5: Accuracies (in %) of valence and sixemotion tags in development set before and afterapplying the reference range and in test setReferencesAndrea Esuli and Fabrizio Sebastiani.
