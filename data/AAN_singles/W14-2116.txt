An Approach for Argumentation Mining in German DiscoursesBianka Trevisan, Eva-Maria Jakobs Human-Computer Interaction Center RWTH Aachen University  {b.trevisan|e.m.jakobs} @tk.rwth-aachen.deEva Dickmeis, Thomas Niehr German Linguistics RWTH Aachen University  {e.dickmeis|t.niehr} @isk.rwth-aachen.de     [In this paper we present a new methodological approach for the analysis of public discourses aiming at the semi-automated identification of arguments by combining methods from discourse analysis with methods from Natural Language Processing.
Discourses evolve over long periods of time and, consequently, form a broad data-base.
Up to now, the analysis of discourses is hitherto performed primarily by hand, i.e., only small corpora or discourse fragments can be ana-lyzed.
Inevitably, this leads to lengthy and ex-pensive annotation.
Thus, there is a growing in-terest to overcome these methodological chal-lenges by the use of computer-based methods and tools for the semi-automated analysis.
However, there are only few approaches known that focus on the analysis of discourses and the (semi-)automated identification of argu-ments therein (e.g.
Reed at al., 2008; Liakata et al., 2012; Ashley and Walker, 2013).
Particular-ly, approaches that can be explicitly used for the analysis of German-language discourses exist only in initial stages.
Therefore, we suggest a fine-grained semi-automated approach based on multi-level annotation that focuses on linguistic means as indicators of arguments.
The aim is to identify regularities, respectively, indicators in the linguistic surface of the discourse (e.g.
recur-ring lexical and typographical characteristics), which indicate the occurrence of certain argu-ments (e.g.
premise).
In this paper, we focus on the identification of indicators of argument-conclusion relationship: conclusive connectors or conclusiva, that are typically adverbs such as hence, consequently, therefore, thus, because (Govier, 2013; see example below): Die Campusbahn werde den Individualverkehr verdr?ngen, weil die Stadt eng bebaut sei.
Schon in den 1970er Jahren sei deshalb das Aus f?r die Stra?enbahn besiegelt worden.
[The campus train will displace the individual traffic because the city is densely built.
There-fore, the end for the tram was sealed in the 1970s.]
As an application example, a small corpus consisting of 21 newspaper articles is analyzed.
The corpus belongs to the interdisciplinary pro-ject Future Mobility (FuMob), which is funded by the Excellent Initiative of the German federal and state governments.
The methodological ap-proach consists of three steps, which are per-formed iteratively: (1) manual discourse-linguistic argumentation analysis, (2) semi-automatic Text Mining (PoS-tagging and linguis-tic multi-level annotation), and (3) data merge.
(1) Discourse-linguistic argumentation analy-sis: First, the data is manually analyzed.
Objec-tives of the analysis are (i) identifying discourse-relevant arguments, (ii) forming argument clas-ses, and (iii) determining the significance of an argument in the discourse (Niehr 2004).
To de-termine the significance of an argument the use by various discourse participants is analyzed and quantified.
The argument-use can be categorized as argumentative, positively cited, negatively cited or neutrally cited.
In addition, to identify arguments and their use in public discourse, the analysis also aims to detect and characterize dis-course participants who use similar arguments.
For this purpose, the social role, gender or age of an argument?s author are determined on the basis of the information given in the text.
This allows comparing the argumentation of different social groups in public discourses.
(2) Text Mining: Parallel to the manual dis-course analysis, the collected data is processed semi-automatically applying the methodology described in Trevisan (2014/in press).
Thereby, post-processing is performed in four successive methodological steps.
First, the data is tokenized104by means of the TreeTagger tokenizer (Schmid 1995).
Second, the tokenized data is PoS-tagged using TreeTagger.
Third, the automatically to-kenized and tagged data is manually corrected.
Fourth, the corpus is annotated semi-automatically applying the multi-level annotation model depicted in Trevisan et al.
(2014/in press); the annotation is performed using the tool Auto-Annotator.
Originally, the model was used for the enhancement of automatic Sentiment Analy-sis in German blog comments.
The annotation model consists of different annotation levels with various purposes and scopes (token vs. sequence of tokens) of annotation, e.g., the annotation of the morpho-syntactic function of a token vs. the annotation of the polarity (positive, negative, neutral) of a sentence or utterance.
Thereby, the fact is taken into account that each token fulfills different grammatical functions, which are also relevant for the constitution of evaluative state-ments and arguments.
The basic idea is, that the interplay and combination of different annotated linguistic means constitutes or indicates an ar-gument and its way of use.
(3) Data merge: In a third step, the analysis results from (1) and (2) are merged.
By the data merge, it appears, which linguistic means on which linguistic level interplays or often occurs with which kind of argument.
The results of the data merge are evaluated regarding the enhance-ment of automatic argumentation analysis.
The results show that the argument-conclusion relationship is most often indicated by the con-junction because followed by since, therefore and so.
In detail, the results show that indicators for argument-conclusion relationship include not only causal conjunctions (e.g.
because, since), but also concessive (e.g.
although, despite) or conditional conjunctions (e.g.
if ... then).
There-by, the conclusiva indicate either the argument (e.g.
because, since, also) or the conclusions (e.g.
hence, therefore, so).
In the second case, they are still references to arguments that often occur immediately prior to the conclusion.
Fur-thermore, conclusiva occur predominantly as a single token.
If they occur as a multi-token they have a reinforcing (e.g.
just because) respective-ly limiting or negating function (e.g.
only be-cause).
The results raise the suspicion that the identi-fied conclusiva are text type-specific phenome-non as the analyzed corpus contains only articles from newspapers.
However, we assume that some of the conclusiva may occur across differ-ent text types (e.g.
because, therefore) whereasother (e.g.
for this reason, in the end) tends to be text type-specific indicators for argument-conclusion relationships.
Moreover, having a closer look at the text da-ta, it is evident that conclusiva only bear evi-dence of argument-conclusion relationships.
They do not indicate where the argument or con-clusion starts or ends or in which sequence (ar-gument-conclusion vs. conclusion-argument) they occur.
Regarding the semi-automated analy-sis of arguments in discourses this constitutes a difficulty.
One solution to approach this chal-lenge might be to define the text window, which has to be considered left and right from the con-clusiva.
In this context, the work of Wellner and Pustejovsky (2007) has to be considered, too.
Future work will focus on the enhancement of the methodological approach and its automation, which includes i.a.
the implementation of ap-proaches such as anaphora resolution or pattern recognition.
Furthermore, the analysis must be extended to other corpora and text types.
