reg-ular lexlcahzatlon patterns and corpus frequency4 2 Cross-hnguistm overlap of mmmatchesTo get an idea of the cross-hngumtlc overlap of un-matched synsets such as the above, we have in-spected a sample of the Italian and German mis-matches to see if they could potentially overlap withDutch synsets The Italian and German synsets havebeen selected because they had no stralghtforCardmapping with the ILI after manual checking Com-pamson with a random sample of 36 German nounsynsets howed that 50% of the nouns (18) have anequivalent m Dutch For a sample of 59 Ital,an nouns)nsets there is at least an overlap of 30% (20) withDutch Examples are Arbeltszeitverkurzung (DE)= arbeidstijdverkortmg (NL) = (reduction of work-mg hours) and Baita (IT) = berghut (NL) = (cabinin the mountain)If we quantify these results for the total Dutchwordnet, where about 6,000 Dutch synsets can notbe translated, this would imply that at least 30%(2,000 synsets) represent new concepts that over-lap with German or Italian, and therefore shouldbe added to the ILI, although we feel that a nativeEnglish speaker should verify' the.absence of the con-cept m English and in WordNetl 5For the ILI-~erbs it is much more difficult to gl~eany numbers For German only 10 ILI-verbs areproposed It is not posmble to draw any conclusionsfrom such a small set The number of Italian ILI-verbs is about 70 and ,t is clear that the overlap withDutch is vely lo~ This is due to the fact that man)proposed verbs (50~) are multl-x~mds in Dutch, e gabbuzars2 (get serious) znfiacchwe(make l zy) Justas the Dutch verbs m the pre~ lous subsection, manyof these can be assigned with an EQ.HYPERONY\Iand EQ_CAUSES to l~ N1 5 and therefore do nothave to be added as a new ILI concept The re-roaming cases are too difficult to judge, and moreinformation is needed to understand the intendedconceptFor verbs ~e thus expect hat the number of newILIs will be relatively low First of all, there notmany synsets that do not have translations (com-pared to nouns) and secondly, unmatched verbals~nsets often can be linked somehow exhaustively5 Us ing the ILI as a standardizedmeanings in NLPThe ILI provides a language-neutral conceptual mapfor -especially multlllngual- NLP apphcauons Forinstance, a multlhngual text collect,on can be in-dexed m terms of the ILI records, obtaining auniform representatmn for documents,
