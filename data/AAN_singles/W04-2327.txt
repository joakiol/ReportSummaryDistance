The MATE/GNOME Proposals for Anaphoric Annotation, RevisitedMassimo PoesioUniversity of EssexDepartment of Computer Science and Centre for Cognitive ScienceUnited KingdomAbstractIn the five years since it was proposed, theMATE scheme for anaphoric annotation hasbeen used in a variety of annotation projects,and the resulting corpora have been used tostudy both anaphora resolution and NL gener-ation.
Annotation tools inspired by the propos-als have been used in some of these projects.In this paper we discuss these first experienceswith the scheme, some lessons that have beenlearned, and suggest a few modifications.1 IntroductionThe MATE ?meta-scheme?
for anaphora annotation (Poe-sio et al, 1999) is one of the annotation schemes devel-oped as part of the MATE project (McKelvie et al, 2001),whose goal was to develop annotation tools suitable fordifferent types of dialogue annotation.
The scheme hasserved as the basis for a number of annotation projects,such as the development of the GNOME corpus (Poe-sio, 2000a) and, more recently, of the VENEX corpus ofanaphora in Italian spoken dialogue and text (Poesio etal., 2004a).
The GNOME corpus has been used to studysalience, particularly as formalized in Centering theory(Poesio et al, 2004c), to develop statistical models of nat-ural language generation (e.g., (Poesio, 2000a; Henschelet al, 2000; Cheng et al, 2001; Cheng, 2001; Karama-nis, 2003)) and to evaluate anaphora resolution systems,with a special focus on the resolution of bridging refer-ences (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov,2004; Poesio et al, 2004b).
Aspects of the scheme havebeen implemented in annotation tools including MMAX(Mu?ller and Strube, 2003) and the Annotator tool devel-oped by ILSP.
As a result of this work, many aspectsof the proposals concerning anaphoric annotation madein MATE and GNOME have been subjected to a thoroughtest.
In this paper we discuss some of the lessons learnedthrough this work, some issues that have been raised, andhow they have been or could be addressed.2 The MATE ProposalsThe design of an annotation scheme involves a numberof decisions: what has to be annotated, how, and howthe annotation should be recorded (the markup scheme).One of the most important motivations behind the designof the MATE proposals for anaphoric annotation is the be-lief that given the variety of phenomena that go under thename of anaphora, and the variety of possible applica-tions, there can be no such thing as a general-purposeanaphoric annotation instructions.
On the other hand,we also believed that it is possible to design a generalpurpose markup scheme (and therefore, general-purposetools) that could then be used in different ways for dif-ferent projects.
The approach taken in MATE was thento design a general markup scheme (the ?meta-scheme?
)and then to show its basic building blocks could be usedto implement different types of anaphoric annotation, in-cluding some of the most popular schemes for ?coref-erence annotation,?
such as the MUC scheme (MUCCS)(Hirschman, 1998), Passonneau?s DRAMA scheme (1997), and the scheme used for annotation of references tolandmarks in the MapTask corpus.
In this section wesummarize the most distinctive features of the proposalsresulting from this basic assumption.
The full descriptionof the MATE scheme is available from the MATE projectpages at http://mate.nis.sdu.dk/.2.1 Coreference, Anaphora and DiscourseModelingThe MATE scheme differs from the best-known schemefor annotating ?coreference,?
MUCCS (Hirschman, 1998)both in the conceptualization underlying the annotation(i.e., what type of information should be annotated) andin the way this information is marked up.
MUCCS wasdesigned to encode information deemed useful for a sub-task of information extraction, and the instructions pro-vided to annotators were meant to ensure that all infor-mation provided by a text about a certain entity would bemarked using a single device, the IDENT relation.
Asvan Deemter and Kibble (2000) point out, however, theresult is rather ad hoc; the IDENT relation as defined bythe instructions doesn?t capture any coherent definitionof ?coreference?.
(In fact, the very notion of ?reference?is rather difficult to formalize precisely.
)The MATE proposals, by contrast, while still labeled asproposals for ?coreference annotation,?
because the namehas become a de facto standard as a result of the MUCinitiative, are explicitly based on the DISCOURSE MODELassumption adopted almost universally by linguists (com-putational and not) working on anaphora resolution andgeneration (Webber, 1979; Heim, 1982; Kamp and Reyle,1993; Gundel et al, 1993).
This is the hypothesis thatinterpreting a discourse involves building a shared dis-course model containing DISCOURSE ENTITIES that mayor may not ?refer?
to specific objects in the world, as wellas the relations between these entities.
The type of an-notation for which the MATE scheme was developed?andthat we?ll call here ?anaphoric annotation,?.1 is meant asa partial representation of the discourse model evoked bya text (hence, for example, the tag used for nominal ex-pressions denoting discourse entities, ?de?
).22.2 The Markup SchemeThe design of the MATE workbench was strongly inspiredby the concept of STANDOFF ANNOTATION developed forthe reorganization of the MapTask.
The main principleof standoff annotation is that each level of annotation?for example, syntactic annotation, dialogue act annota-tion, and anaphoric annotation?should be stored indepen-dently; in this way, annotators working on one level neednot be concerned about the other levels of annotation, andcan start immediately without having to wait for other an-notation tasks to be completed.
The separate levels ofannotation are synchronized via a base file, to which theseparate levels point using the HREF mechanism of XML.The markup scheme for anaphoric relations is thecore aspect of the MATE proposals and its most dis-tinctive aspect.
As in the MUC scheme, it is as-1van Deemter and Kibble (2000) give a stricly textual def-inition of ?anaphora?
which is very distant from the commonuse of the term ?anaphora resolution?
in computational linguis-tics, typically used to indicate the interpretation of (parts of) themeaning of an expression with respect to the discourse model.2In fact, the use of the term ?coreference annotation?
wouldnot be completely misguided.
van Deemter and Kibble (2000)assume the definition of ?reference?
typically found in formalsemantics, but in functional linguistics, the term ?referring ex-pression?
is used to indicate expressions that introduce new dis-course entities in a discourse model or that denote an old one(see, e.g., (Gundel et al, 1993)).sumed that annotation of anaphoric information involvesidentifying MARKABLES (the text constituent that real-ize semantic objects that may enter in anaphoric rela-tions), and marking up anaphoric relations between them.The main difference from MUCCS is that whereas inMUCCS anaphoric relations are annotated using an at-tribute of the markables, in the MATE markup scheme?following the recommendations of the Text Encoding Ini-tiative (Burnard and Sperberg-McQueen, 2002), and ofBruneseaux and Romary (1998)?the distinction betweenthese two steps of annotation is mirrored by a distinc-tion between two XML elements: ?de?, used to indi-cate the markables, and ?link?, used to mark informa-tion about anaphoric relations (or any other semantic re-lation).3 However, unlike in the TEI proposals, in theMATE markup scheme ?link?
elements are structuredelements, containing one or more ?anchor?
element.The ?link?
element specifies the anaphoric expression(using XML?s HREFmechanism) and the relation betweenthe anaphoric expression and its antecedent; whereas the?anchor?
element specifies the antecedent, as in (1)where, for example, the first ?link?
elements encodesthe information that the discourse entities realized by theNPs the engine E3 and it denote the same object.
(1) coref.xml<de ID="de_01">we</de>?re gonna take<de ID="de_07"> the engine E3 </de>and shove <de ID="de_08"> it </de> overto <de ID="de_02">Corning</de>,hook <de ID="de_09"> it </de> up to<de ID="de_03">the tanker car</de>...<link href="coref.xml#id(de_07)"type="ident"><anchor href="coref.xml#id(de_08)"/></link><link href="coref.xml#id(de_08)"type="ident"><anchor href="coref.xml#id(de_09)"/></link>There were two main reasons for having ?link?
ele-ments separated from the elements used to indicate mark-ables.
The first reason is that in this way ?link?
ele-ments can be kept in a separate file from ?de?
elements,in keeping with the idea of standoff annotation.
The sec-ond, and more important, reason is that in this way it ispossible to annotate multiple anaphoric relations involv-ing the same anaphoric expression without having multi-ple attributes for each markable.The reason why ?link?
elements may have more thanone ?anchor?
element is to allow for the possibility toannotate ambiguities.
For some types of applications, itmay be a good idea not to ask annotators to decide uponthe interpretation of ambiguous anaphoric expressions.3It was assumed that the tags for ?coreference?
annotationwould be part of a special namespace, COREF?i.e., that the ac-tual name of these tags are ?coref:de?, ?coref:link?, etc.We omit the namespace indication in this paper.In these cases, the multiple anchors mechanisms allowseach of the possibilities to be marked by means of a sepa-rate ?anchor?
element.
In (2a), for example, the pronunit in 15.16 could refer equally well to engine E3 or thetanker car.
With the MATE mechanism, both antecedentscan be annotated, as shown in (2b).

Three such examples were considered.The Core Scheme In the most basic type of corefer-ence scheme, only anaphoric relations between NPs areconsidered, and only identity relations.
Schemes of thistype can be implemented by having just one anaphoricrelation, IDENT.
The remaining differences between theschemes have then mostly to do with the instructions toannotators?for example, which types of anaphoric rela-tions to be considered as cases of ?identity?
(see (vanDeemter and Kibble, 2000) for some problems with thechoices made in MUCCS).
In the comments for the de-signers of a scheme, it was suggested that some of thecases marked as coreference in MUCCS, such as the rela-tion between the temperature and 90 degrees in the tem-perature rose to 90 degrees before dropping to 70 de-grees, would be best marked as function-value relations(viewing the temperature as a function from objects andtime points into values, rather than an individual-denotingterm).Extended Relations In DRAMA, a number of associa-tive relations are considered, such as SUBSET or PART,together with instructions how to annotate them.
Thistypes of anaphora can be annotated in the MATE markupscheme using additional relations, as in (3), where thediscourse entity realized by LES FUSEES QUI ONTBIEN VOLE?
denotes a subset of the set denoted by dis-course entity DE 88, LES MODELES DE FUSEES.

element was suggested for MapTask-style annotations of references to visible objects.
The?universe?
element containing one ?ue?
elementfor each object in the visual scene; including suchelements in an annotation makes it possible to use?link?
elements to annotate references to such objects.4Cases in which the participants to a conversation havedifferent visual situations, as in the MapTask dialogues,can be handled by having separate universes, one foreach participant to the conversation.
In addition, aWHO-BELIEVES attribute of ?link?
elements wasproposed to represent situations in which only oneparticipant believes that a particular anaphoric relationholds, as in example (7) (Appendix A), where it?s onlythe follower to believe that a gold mine refers to the sameobject as diamond mine.2.4 Instructions for Identifying MarkablesBecause the goal of the MATE annotation proposals wasto provide a set of tools that could be used to imple-ment a variety of options, rather than to identify a spe-cific scheme appropriate for all applications, it didn?tmake sense to specify detailed instructions for annota-tion.
However, a substantial effort was made to pro-vide an exhaustive inventory of the options for identi-4The ?universe?

developed in Discourse Representation Theory (DRT),although simplified in a number of ways.fying markables that were available to the designers ofa scheme for anaphoric annotation.
These suggestionswere in part derived from MUCCS and from Passonneau?sDRAMA scheme, but a number of additional problemswere considered as well.As in MUCCS, it was assumed that annotation ofanaphora is best separated in two steps: first the mark-ables (the text constituent that realize semantic objectsthat may enter in anaphoric relations) are agreed upon,then anaphoric relations between them are marked.Concerning markable identification, the main sugges-tions were to concentrate on anaphoric expressions re-alized as NPs and their antecedents; and to rely on theoutput of a parser as much as possible.
But because ofthe assumption that only NPs evoking discourse entitiesshould be considered, it was suggested that not all NPshould be treated as markables: for example, it was rec-ommended that NPs in post-verbal position in predica-tive clauses (such as a policeman in John is a policeman)should be excluded.
This recommendation was later re-considered (see below).One of the novel aspects of the MATE instructions wasthe concern for markable identification in languages otherthan English.
One such issue was how to deal with incor-porated clitics and empty subjects; the suggestion was touse a separate element, ?seg?, to turn verbs into non-nominal markables, as in the following example:(4) coref.xml:A: Dov?e?
<de ID="de_157">Gianni?</de>[Where is Gianni?
]B: <seg type="pred" ID="seg_158 >e?andato a mangiare </seg>[_ went to have lunch]<link href="coref.xml#id(seg_158)"type="ident"><anchor href="coref.xml#id(de_157)"/></link>It was also proposed that the ?seg?
element could beused in more ambitious schemes as general mechanismfor specifying non-nominal markables ?e.g., in ellipsis,to indicate the antecedents of discourse deixis, etc.53 Work based on the MATE proposalsIdeas from the MATE ?scheme?
have been adopted andtested both in annotation projects and by the developersof annotation tools.
In this section we review some ofthese activities and summarize the conclusions concern-ing advantages and disadvantages of the MATE schemethat can be drawn from them.5A second range of issues considered in the MATE schemehad to do with dialogue phenomena, such as non-contiguouselements; we will not consider these issues here.3.1 Annotation work related to the GNOME projectThe most direct application of the ideas discussed abovewas found in the annotation work undertaken as part ofthe GNOME project.
GNOME was concerned with the em-pirical investigation of the aspects of discourse that ap-pear to affect generation, especially salience (Pearson etal., 2000; Poesio et al, 2000; Poesio and Di Eugenio,2001; Poesio and Nissim, 2001; Poesio et al, 2004c).Particular attention was paid to the factors affecting thegeneration of pronouns (Pearson et al, 2000; Henschel etal., 2000), demonstratives (Poesio and Nygren-Modjeska,To appear) possessives (Poesio and Nissim, 2001) anddefinites in general (Poesio, 2004).
These results, andthe annotated corpus, were applied to the developmentof both symbolic and statistical natural language genera-tion algorithms with the application of these empirical re-sults to natural language generation, from sentence plan-ning (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al, 2000; Cheng et al,2001), to aggregation (Cheng, 2001) and text planning(Kibble and Power, 2000; Karamanis, 2003).
The empir-ical side of the project involved both psychological exper-iments and corpus annotation, based on a scheme basedon the MATE proposals, as well as on a detailed anno-tation manual (Poesio, 2000b), the reliability of whoseinstructions was tested by extensive experiments (Poesio,2000a).
More recently, the corpus has also been used todevelop and evaluate anaphora resolution systems, witha special focus on the resolution of bridging references(Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004;Poesio et al, 2004b).The corpus The GNOME corpus currently includestexts from three domains, about 3000 NPs were anno-tated in each domain.
The museum subcorpus consistsof descriptions of museum objects, generally with an as-sociated picture, and brief texts about the artists that pro-duced them.
The pharmaceutical subcorpus is a selectionof leaflets providing the patients with legally mandatoryinformation about their medicine.Several layers of information were annotated, includ-ing layout in the case of text and rhetorical structure inthe case of tutorial dialogues, sentences and potential ut-terances, noun phrases, a variety of attributes of the ob-jects denoted by noun phrases,6 and anaphoric relation.We concentrate here on anaphoric information, and referthe reader to the manual for the other types of annotation.Markup scheme The markup scheme for markablesand anaphoric relations adopted in GNOME follows very6E.g., whether an NP denoted generically or not; whether itdenoted an animate or inanimate entity, as well as other onto-logical properties; and whether it denoted a discourse entity, aquantifier, or a predicate.
In the case of a discourse entity, wealso annotated whether it denoted an atom, a set, or a mass term;and whether it denoted uniquely or not.closely that proposed in MATE, except that the ?de?
ele-ment was renamed ?ne?
(since all NPs were marked), andthe ?link?
element was renamed ?ante?.
More sub-stantial differences are the decision not to use standoff,and the introduction of new elements necessary for thestudy of salience, such as elements that could be used toinvestigate the notion of UTTERANCE used in Centering(Poesio et al, 2004c).Although standoff is a clear improvement over includ-ing all annotation levels in a single file, our own expe-riences during the creation of the GNOME corpus beingfurther proof of this, it?s only really possible when toolsare available both to create the annotation and?crucially?later to ?knit back?
the separate levels when needed.
Asneither the MATE workbench nor any other tools basedon standoff were available by the time the GNOME an-notation started,7 in GNOME we didn?t use standoff, butintegrated all levels of annotation in one file; an Emacsmode was developed for the annotation.
This decisionmade it very easy to use the annotated corpus for a num-ber of studies, but did resulted in a number of problems,the main among which were that the annotators had to bevery careful not to damage other annotations; that annota-tors working on one level were occasionally confused byannotations for other levels; and that the annotation workhad to be organized in a careful sequential way even forlevels that could have been annotated independently.The main new aspect of the markup scheme, espe-cially as far as our studies of salience were concerned,are the elements used to annotate potential utterancesin the sense of Centering (Grosz et al, 1995).
In or-der not to prejudge the answer to the question of whichtext constituents are best viewed as utterances, we used a?generic?
element called ?unit?
to mark up finite andnon-finite clauses, but also parentheticals and apposi-tions, elements of bulleted lists, etc.The following example illustrates both the use of?unit?
elements and of the elements ?ne?
and ?ante?replacing ?de?
and ?link?

and the?MapTask?
instantiations of the MATE meta-scheme.One of our aims was to continue the work on bridgingreferences annotation and interpretation in (Poesio andVieira, 1998), which showed that marking up bridgingreferences is quite hard.
In addition, work such as (Sid-ner, 1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999) suggested that indi-rect realization can play a crucial role in maintaining theCB.
After testing a few types of associative reference(Hawkins, 1978), we decided to annotate only three non-identity relations, as well as identity.
These relations area subset of those proposed in the ?extended relations?
ver-sion of the MATE scheme: set membership (ELEMENT),subset (SUBSET), and ?generalized possession?
(POSS),which includes both part-of relations and ownership rela-tions.Coder manual Perhaps the most important aspects ofthe annotation work in GNOME are the development ofdetailed instructions for annotators and the reliability ex-periments testing several aspects of the scheme, particu-larly the annotation of bridging references.The identification of sentences, units and markableswas done entirely by hand, without encountering particu-lar problems.
(The Emacs mode, an extension of SGML-mode, provides some support for introducing new ele-ments, marking regions, and attribute editing, as well asanaphoric annotation.)
Unlike in MATE, all NPs weretagged as ?ne?.
The instructions for ?unit?s werebased on Marcu?s proposals for discourse units annota-tion (Marcu, 1999).
All attributes of sentences, ?unit?sand ?ne?s in the final version of the scheme, includingDEIX, can be annotated reliably.In order to achieve reliability on anaphoric anno-tation, the range of anaphoric phenomena consideredwas restricted in many ways.
Apart from marking alimited number of associative relations, the annotatorsonly marked relations between objects realized by nounphrases and not, for example, anaphoric references toactions, events or propositions implicitly introduced byclauses or sentences.
We also gave strict instructionsto our annotators concerning how much to mark.
Theywere told to mark all identity relations, but to mark as-sociative relations only if either (i) no IDENT relationcould be marked for the anaphoric expression, or (ii)an IDENT relation with an entity not mentioned in theprevious ?unit?.
Furthermore, preferences were speci-fied, e.g., for appositions: for example, in Francois, theDauphin, the embedding NP would be chosen as an an-tecedent of subsequent anaphoric references, rather thanthe NP in appositive position.We found a reasonable, although by no means perfect,agreement on identity relations.
In a typical analysis (twoannotators looking at the anaphoric relations between 200NPs) we observed no real disagreements; 79.4% of theserelations were marked up by both annotators; 12.8% byonly one of them; and in 7.7% of the cases, one of theannotators marked up a closer antecedent than the other.Limiting the relations did limit the disagreements amongannotators on associative relations (only 4.8% of the re-lations are actually marked differently) but only 22% ofbridging references were marked in the same way by bothannotators; 73.17% of relations are marked by only oneor the other annotator.
Reaching agreement on this infor-mation involved several discussions between annotatorsand more than one pass over the corpus (Poesio, 2000a).3.2 Annotation toolsAlthough no annotation tool implementing the MATE orGNOME schemes as described exists, in the years afterthe development of the MATE guidelines tools supportingXML standoff annotation for coreference have appeared,including MMAX from EML (Mu?ller and Strube, 2003)and the Annotator from ILSP.
Although the format usedfor storing anaphoric information by these tools is notentirely satisfactory, the files they produce can be easilyconverted into MATE format.MMAX, for example, is based on a simplified stand-off format, in which three main files are maintained foreach annotated file in the corpus: a base file contain-ing the words, a file identifying sentences, and a fileidentifying markables.
Anaphoric information is storedas attributes of the markables.
Two special attributesare used for this purpose, and recognized by MMAX:the MEMBER attribute, used to indicate membership in acoreference chain (a coreference equivalence class), andthe POINTER attribute, used to mark up to one associa-tive anaphoric relation for each anaphoric expression.
Wediscuss the use of MMAX in the VENEX project below.3.3 The VENEX CorpusThe VENEX corpus is an anaphorically annotated corpusof Italian being created in a joint project between theUniversita?
di Venezia and the University of Essex.
Thecorpus includes both texts (newspaper articles) and dia-logues (an Italian version of the MapTask corpus).
Thisproject widened our experiences of annotation with theMATE scheme in a number of respects.
First of all, anumber of proposals contained in the MATE guidelinesbut not relevant for GNOME, including the suggestionsfor dealing with misunderstandings and for incorporatedanaphoric expressions such as clitics, were tested.
Sec-ondly, in this project we are attempting to identify mark-ables automatically as far a possible, and data are storedin a standoff format, using a modern annotation tool(MMAX) for the annotation.Markup Scheme As MMAX doesn?t support ?link?elements, and anaphoric information is stored with mark-ables, it is necessary to use markable attributes to repre-sent information that would have been encoded as part ofthe links.
We used a separate attribute to specify the typeof associative relation used by POINTER attribute, and aSPACE attribute to encode the information stored in theWHO-BELIEVES attribute of links (see below).
In addi-tion, only one MEMBER and POINTER attributes can bespecified for each markable.This latter limitation wasn?t much of a problem, giventhat the annotation instructions used in VENEX are de-rived from those developed for GNOME and also attemptto limit annotators to mark at most one identity and onebridging relation for each anaphoric expression.
The sep-aration of attributes of links proved, however, a problem,as annotators often forget to annotate one or the other.An additional problem is that the version of MMAX weused (0.92) only allows for one type of markable, mean-ing that ?unit?
elements could not be annotated, andinstead of using separate ?ne?
and ?seg?
elements fornominal and non-nominal markables, a single markablehad to be used (see below).8Misunderstandings The MapTask part of the VENEXcorpus contains numerous examples like (7), where thedifferences between Giver and Follower map lead to oneparticipant believing that two objects are anaphoricallyrelated, while the other participant either is not aware ofthis or doesn?t believe this to be the case.
We found thatafter a few iterations of training, our annotators were ableto handle these cases properly (a more formal evaluationis underway; we hope to report the results at the meet-ing).
Again, the only problems were caused by the factthat these attributes had to be added to markables, whichsometimes led to annotators forgetting to set them.
(Thiswas only required in case the default, that an anaphoricrelation was in the common ground of both participants,didn?t hold.
)4 Discussion4.1 Aspects of the MATE proposals that have beenproven usefulOur experience with multi-level annotation in GNOMEsuggests that standoff is clearly the way to go, allowingmultiple annotators to work on the same files, and sepa-rating logically independent tasks, but appropriate toolsare required.
The annotation tools we have discussed,such as MMAX, are therefore useful even though they do8The version of MMAX currently being developed will allowfor multiple markables.not implement all aspects of the MATE.
Knitting back isalso possible with the Discourse API.Our experience with VENEX suggests that two of themost beneficial aspects of having a separate ?link?
ele-ment are ones that we had not originally considered: thatthey can be used to mark general semantic relations, notjust anaphoric relations (for more complex types of se-mantic annotation); and that they make it harder for an-notators to forget to fill in aspects of the annotation.
Un-fortunately, at the moment there is no tool that can beused to create this type of annotation directly.4.2 Aspects already reconsideredPredicative NPs During the GNOME and VENEX anno-tations we realized that the recommendation not to markpredicative NPs makes it impossible to do markable iden-tification automatically.
In addition, it?s often difficultto decide whether an NP is used predicatively or refer-entially, especially in languages like Italian where sub-jects in such clauses are often used predicatively (as inLa soluzione e?
questa).
In GNOME, a new attributeLF TYPE was introduced to specify the type of seman-tic object denoted by an NP: term, quant and pred.The annotators were instructed to concentrate on term-denoting NPs.
The instructions for classifying NPs ac-cording to their semantic type were based mostly on syn-tactic information, but the annotation was reliable.
In theinstructions for the VENEX annotation, the instructionsfor recognizing term-denoting NP are further developed.Restricting the range of associative relations Therange of associative relations tested in GNOME is muchnarrower than those considered in DRAMA, but they canbe annotated reliably, at least in the sense that very fewdisagreements are observed.
Extending the range of re-lations to include, for example, attributes (e.g, I am notgoing to buy that.
The price is too high.
or situationalassociations (John entered a restaurant.
The waiter ap-proached him immediately) has proven difficult.Units and Utterances The study of Centering car-ried in GNOME indicated quite clearly that annotation of?unit?
elements is essential for the study of anaphora.4.3 Further RevisionsOne aspect of the markup scheme that needs revision isthe placement of the semantic relation.
One problem weobserved in GNOME is that often the ambiguity is notsimply between two possible antecedents each of whichstands in the same relation to the anaphoric expression,but between two antecedents which stand in different re-lations.
In the pharmaceutical texts, for example, it is of-ten unclear whether a particular mention of the medicineunder consideration refers to the generic product, or to theparticular instance that the user has in their hands.
In thiscase, we would want annotators to mark the anaphoric ex-pression as IDENT with one object, and ELEMENT of theother (ELEMENT is also used in GNOME for relations be-tween instances and types), as follows, but this is not pos-sible in either the original MATE scheme or in the GNOMEmarkup scheme:(6) <ante current="ne1"><anchor ID="ne2" rel="ident"><anchor ID="ne3" rel="element"></ante>4.4 Open IssuesAmbiguity Offering annotators the opportunity to an-notate anaphoric ambiguity is essential, especially for an-notations used to study linguistic phenomena, but raisesserious theoretical and practical problems.
A coreferencechain containing such links becomes a coreference (di-rected) graph, in which each of the paths across the graphis a potential interpretation.
While having multiple pathsis not a problem as far as evaluating the results of ananaphoric resolver (any path in the graph counts as a validsolution), it is a serious problems both for scripts attempt-ing to ensure consistency (e.g., that all references to thesame object are marked as either generic or non-generic?this is of course impossible when one of the possible an-tecedents is generic while the other isn?t) as well for an-notation tools (the problem is of course worsened whenthe tool only uses a single attribute to indicate member-ship in a coreference chain).Revision A second difficult problem is caused by cases,common in the MapTask dialogues, in which after a whilea participant realizes that their previous belief that an ob-ject was identical to another object is mistaken.
In thesecases, the participant is arguably revising their previousbeliefs; it is not clear then what should be done with theannotation of the original anaphoric information.ReferencesF.
