Transforming a Sentence End into News Headline StyleSatoshi Ikeda and Kazuhide YamamotoDept.
of Electrical Engineering, Nagaoka University of Technologyikeda@nlp.nagaokaut.ac.jp, yamamoto@fw.ipsj.or.jpAbstractNews on electrical bulletin boards con-sist of high density expressions.
Manysentences end with unique expressionsthat consist of nouns and case parti-cles.
This paper focuses on expressionsused at the end of sentences and at-tempts to summarize them by formingnoun or case particle endings.
We sum-marize the news sentence through pat-tern matching approach.
Our evalua-tion illustrates that the summarizer re-duces 2.50 characters per sentence onaverage; the reduction ratio is 6%.
Wealso show that people perceive the cor-rect meanings of the summarized sen-tences with 95% accuracy.1 IntroductionElectrical bulletin board displays the latestnews headlines which each newspaper office an-nounced.
News headlines are shorter than news-papers?
news with laconicism because they aresummarized to transfer in limited space.One of a characteristics of Japanese news head-lines can be seen at sentence ends (Exp.1).Exp.1)????????????????
(Countermeasure for alleged abduction is judgedafter the movement of administration party.
)Although the end of sentence in Exp.1 is omit-ted, we have no difficulty to understand the mean-ing.
We unconsciously complete the sentence byguessing what is omitted without a mistake.
With-out unnecessary ends, these type of sentences areshort and nonredundant.The final purpose of this work is to transformnews sentences into a news headline style.
InJapanese, sentences end with nouns or case par-ticles are grammatically incorrect, however, thiskind of expressions are shorter than grammati-cally perfect sentences, and hence often used tomeet the limited length.
We believe many sen-tences have semantically redundant expressionsin the end, which needs to be focused in summa-rization.In this paper we present a list of deletable ex-pressions at Japanese sentence ends.
We haveto carefully investigate which sentence ends aredeletable, and how to change into the headlinestyle.
We present the concrete expressions ofdeletion with examples and illustrate effects ofdeletion.2 Related WorksAs the most similar work to ours, Sato et al[6]tries to extract paraphrasing patterns of sentenceend by preparing a lot of alignment pairs betweennews sentences and their headline versions.
Theycompare the sentences from the ends and obtainmany correspondences between the two.
How-ever, they have no proposals on how to use theseone-to-N correspondences, i.e., the way to selectone from many candidates.
Our approach is to ob-tain many transformation patterns as well, but wedo not use aligned corpus; we use a large collec-tion of news headlines instead and find patternsby our thorough observation.Wakao et al[7] compares newscast and corre-sponding subtitle expressions to investigate thedifferences of them.
One of the observation tar-gets is sentence end, and they have shown ussome typical patterns of conversion into a shortnews.
This enumerates phraseologies which areable to be cut down and investigates the frequencyof use.
In news subtitles nouns or case particlesare used at the sentence end.
This work is drewupon literature [7] while we investigated in ourown right.
We shaded light on the phraseologieswhich do not exist literature [7] such as??????????????
(There seems to sur-render.)?.
We examined the phraseologies which41are disposed by machine.
Fukushima et al [1] cutoff the unnecessary part from literature [7].There are investigations to summarize textby confining the number of characters [2,3,5].Ishizako et al[2] cut off areas of overlap.
Ohmoriet al[5] and Mikami et al[3] summarized text al-together, but these investigations do not focus onsentence ends.3 News Headlines and Their SentenceEndsThere is an email service that delivers Japanesenews headlines three times a day on week-days.
That is Nikkei news mail(1) provided byNIKKEI-goo.
We have been collecting themsince December 1999.
Table1 shows the statisticswe have obtained.Table 1: Statistical datum which are collectednumber of mails 3365number of stories 21127number of sentences 40374News headlines are more distinctive than newsstories in sentence end.
Therefore, we investi-gated part of speech on both news headlines andnewspaper(Nihon Keizai Shimbun(2)).
Table2shows the comparison.Table 2: Occurrence ratio of POS in sentence endoccurrence ratio[%]POS newspaper headlinesnoun 23.70 55.92(verbal noun) (5.00) (39.90)verb 28.66 15.91adjective 1.80 0.19adverb 0.20 0.22particle 1.56 8.83(case particles) (0.34) (6.41)auxiliary verb 38.59 18.52symbol 5.42 0.40In the newspaper, declinable words are respon-sible for the majority of sentence ends.
In newsheadlines, there are in fact many verbal nouns insentence ends.Japanese words are classified broadly into twotypes; one derived from China and another origi-nated in Japan.
News headlines contain the for-mer more than the latter because words fromChina carry more information in fewer characters.We investigated news headlines and news on a pa-per which contained words of both Chinese andJapanese origins.
The result is shown in Table3.In fact, news headlines preferably use the wordsof Chinese origin about three times as much asthat of Japanese origin.Table 3: Ratios of Chinese and Japanese originwords in (a) newspaper and (b) headlines.ratios [%]Japanese Chinese (a) (b) a/b????

Cut off dictum and honorific phraseology (1)2.
Cut off????
(wo shimesu:show)?
(1)3.
Change verbal noun(2)4.
Cut off???
(naru)?(2)5.
Cut off the part which follows?????
(akirakani)?(2)6.
Change words of Japanese origin(2)7.
Cut off?????
(teshimau)?(1)8.
Cut off???
(tatu)?(2)9.
Transform phraseology indicated the action in the fu-ture (2)4210.
Change to compound noun (3)We summarized in this order, and process 3.?9.
can be switched.4.1 Cut Off Dictum and Honorific Phraseol-ogyPhraseologies shown below are dictum or hon-orific phraseology.
These phraseology in sentenceend is cut off because these are not necessary tounderstand the meaning.?
dictum phraseology: ????

(wo simesu:show)?When a sentence end is ????
(woshimesu)?or?????
(wo shimeshita)?, thisphraseology is cut off because???
(shimesu)?has little meaning in that sentence.
The main verbof the sentence is the verbal noun before????
(wo shimesu)?.4.3 Change Verbal NounsThe expression after the verbal noun closestto the main verb of the sentence is deleted.
InJapanese, we put a word???
(suru)?
after averbal noun to make a verb, but in the summaryit can be deleted since we can still understand theusage.When a self-sufficient word exists following averbal noun, we do not dispose this.Step 1 The part following???
(suru)?
is cut.Nominalized verbal noun to cut???

(naru)?When ?particle ???
(naru)?
exists in asentence, this part and the following are cut off.When a self-sufficient word exists in the cut part,the meaning changes or we do not understand themeaning.Therefore, when a self-sufficient word exists?particle???
(naru)?following, the sentenceis not disposed this arrangement.The?particle???
(naru)?
and the follow-ing are cut off.
When the particle is??

)4.7 Cut Off?????
(teshimau)?When a sentence contains?????
(teshi-mau)?, we feel that the sentence is negative and?????
(teshimau)?
is not necessary to un-derstand the meaning of the sentence.
Thus wecut off?????
(teshimau)?

(tatsu)?When a sentence contains???
(tatsu)?,???
(tatsu)?, the part following it is cut off.
Whenthe following part contains the self-sufficientword, the meaning changes or we do not under-stand the meaning.Therefore, when a self-sufficient word exists inthe following part, the sentence is not disposedthis arrangement.
When???
(tatsu)?
is a partof idiom, the sentence is not disposed of this ar-rangement.Step 1 ???

(keikaku:attempt)?or ???
(yotei:plan)?
exists in the sentence,the phraseology can changed to ??
(he)?
inJapanese.
Therefore, the terms listed below arethe phraseology of indicated the action in the fu-ture.
When ???

)5 ExperimentsWe implemented the proposed technique withPerl programming language to measure the ade-45quacy of proposed technique.
We summary withthis program.
Then input sentence are all sen-tences seen in the newspaper corpus.
The numberof input sentences is 232,038, and 73,512 outputsare somehow summarized in our method.5.1 Summarization RatioWe calculated a sentence ratio and number ofreduced characters in a sentence.
This result ofexperiment is shown in Table4.
The method ofTable4 shows the section number.
This Table4shows the result which used the only one method.The summarization ratio is 94%.
In fact, thismethod is reduced the 6% about one sentence.Table 4: Summarization ratioprocess 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5# sentence 16825 1313 37995 7510 199summ.

ratio 0.96 0.89 0.92 0.87 0.94# reduced char.
2.20 3.93 3.28 6.57 2.455.2 Subjective EvaluationWe also evaluated the proposed technique byhuman judgment.
We picked up 1,000 sentencesat random from summary sentences, and three ex-aminees individually accounted them.
The sen-tences are measured by majority decision.
As-sessment criterion is: (1) same meaning withoutcontext, and (2) low unnaturalness.
The result isshown in Table5.
The numbers in the table de-note the section numbers explaining the processof transformation.Table 5: Correctness of each processmethod 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5# sentence 231 19 492 107 9# correct 205 18 481 106 8ratio 0.89 0.95 0.98 0.99 0.89method 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 total# sentence 116 21 3 13 1000# correct 113 17 3 12 952ratio 0.97 0.81 1 0.92 0.95We have also computed the influence of per-sonal difference.
In this kind of subjective evalua-tion different person may answer difference judg-ment.
We have evaluated our results in three cri-teria: (1) at least one said correct, (2) at least twosaid correct, and (3) all three said correct.
This re-sult is shown in Table6.
The Table illustrates thatcorrectness is more than 90% in all cases.Table 6: Correctness changes by personal differ-ences.?
1 ?
2 = 3correctness 0.98 0.95 0.915.3 Comparison to the Human SummariesWe compare summaries of the proposedmethod and by the human.
We picked up 100 sen-tences in summary sentences at random.
One ex-aminee summarized the original sentences whichcorresponded the pick up the summary sentences.We computed the summarization ratio about thesesentences.
The result is shown in Table7.Table 7: Comparison of summaries by proposedtechnique and manual summarymachine human# sentence 72727 100summ.
ratio 0.94 0.92# reduced characters 2.45 3.87Although the sentence ratio of machine sum-mary is close to the manual summary?s one, num-ber of reduced characters are approximately onecharacter different.
This indicates that human tryto change many parts of sentence according tothe change of the sentence end, while the ma-chine does not consider such influence.
Changeof sentence end often requires transforming thewhole syntax structure, such as change of aspector form.
We need more investigations on this is-sue.6 Discussions6.1 Discussion of Erroneous SummariesIn this section we describe some erroneoussummaries by our method and discuss the rea-sons.Exp.13)????????????????????????
15.5mm???????????46?*1????????????????????????????????
(The face show the character like an annual ring.
)Exp.13 is error example in arrangement ?cutoff the ????
(wo shimesu:show)??
Whenthe term before ????
(wo shimesu)?is thenoun, the sentence does not have main verb.
Themain verb which does not exist in the sentenceis not right in Japanese.
when the term before????
(wo shimesu)?
is noun, this arrange-ment does not disposed.
This kind of error iscovered.
But when the noun is ???
(kan-gae:concept)?,???
(ikou:disposition)?or????
(mitooshi:forecast)?, this arrangement iscorrect.Exp.14)??????????????????????*????????????????
(It is decided to caution the overuse to user.
)Exp.14 is the error example ?change the wordof Japanese origin.
When the cut off?????
(surukoto:doing)?, the modification relationis changed.
Therefore, the modification relationis a wrong one.
When the particle??
(wo)?
ischanged to particle??
(no)?, this kind of erroris covered(Exp.15).Exp.15)??????????????????????????????????????Exp.16)??????????????????*?????????????
(He thinks that his mother killed.
)Exp.16 is an error example in ?cut off?????
(teshimau)??.
When?????
(tesimau)?iscut off, it is not congruent inflected forms of?????
(teshimau)?
and the verb.
When?????
(teshimau)?
is cut off, the inflected formsmust be congruent.6.2 Verbalness/Nominalness of Verbal NounThe sentence end is????
(ha hatsu:first)?in Section4.3.
There are a big differences by hu-mans in degree of accepting this expression.
Wethus change expression????
(ha hatsu)?into?????
(hajimete:first)??.
The example be-fore changed is shown in Exp.17.Exp.17)????????????????????????????????????????????????????
?1symbol ?*?
indicates that the sentence is wrong.
(It is the first time that President Putin has a talk to the cap-tain of Arab Crown)Some people feel unnatural or wrong in thisexample.
But when the original sentences donot have ????
(hajimete:first)?, the sum-mary sentences are correct.
The example is shownExp.18 without????
(hajimete:first)?.Exp.18)????????????????????????????????????????????
?This example gives us no unnaturalness.
Wethink the verbal noun affect this.
The verbal nounrepresents that indicates the kind.
The verbal op-eration of verbal noun is varied by humans.We think concretely about ???(kaidan:meeting)?
of Exp.17and Exp.18.First, we think that ???
(kaidan:meeting)?is complemented the verbal noun ?????
(kaidan suru:have a talk)?.
The predicate isgenerally at sentence end in Japanese.
Whenthe predicate does not exist in a sentence, it isinclinable in human thought that sentence endterm is predicate.
The other hand, we thinkthat ???
(kaidan:colloquy)?
is nominalor verbal operation in Exp.18 because ???(kaidan:meeing)?
is not sentence end.
thenwhen ???
(kaidan:meeting)?
is nominal,human have unnaturalness.
And when ???(kaidan:meeting)?
is verbal, human do not feelunnatural.We cite the error summary which sentence endis noun other than verbal noun in this paper butthe verbal operation of noun is pertained in thesesentences.
And the noun of operation verbal is???
(kangae:concept)?other than verbal noun.6.3 Comparison of Machine and ManualSummariesWe examine the machine and manual sum-maries.
Although many sentences are not muchdifferent, some sentences have big differences forsummarization.
One example is shown as fol-lows, original sentence, its machine summary andits manual summary respectively.Exp.19)???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
(There is graph used the color picture.
)Exp.19 is cut off the honorific phraseology butthe manual summary is cut off???
(aru)?
too.47This is shown that???
(aru)?is dictum phrase-ology.
And the sentence end is??
(mo)?.
Thisis often seen in the news headline.
But the pro-posed technique do not deal with them.6.4 Summarization FailureWe examine the sentences which are not sum-marized by the method.
We picked up the 200sentences at random and examine whether or notit should be summarized.
This results is that 9sentences are missing.
The example is shown be-low with the supposed summary.Exp.20)????????????????????????????????????(Mr.
Ikemoto?s blob was found from the burned-out site.
)Exp.20 is not summarized.
The reason of thiserror is caused by an error of the morphologicalanalysis.7 ConclusionIn order to generate short and smart style seenin news headlines, this paper presents a method oftransforming Japanese sentence end expressionsinto short style.
Our observation reveals that theend of sentence in the headlines are either nounsor case particles in many sentences, we thus at-tempt to summarize them as short as possible.
Wehave implemented the approach and evaluated insummarization ratio and their correctness.
Theresults illustrates that the reduction ratio is 6%against overall sentence length, and the sentenceis expected to be cut off 2.50 characters per sen-tence.
The length of automatic shortening is ap-proximately the same as manual summarization.We also confirmed that 95% of the summarieswere judged to be correct.AcknowledgmentThis work was supported in part by MEXT Grants-in-Aidfor Young Scientists (B) 16700134, and for Scientific Re-search (A) 16200009, Japan.Tools and language resources(1) Nikkei news mail, NIKKEI-goo,http://nikkeimail.goo.ne.jp/(2) Nihon Keizai Shimbun Newspaper Corpus,year 2000, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc.(3) Chasen, Ver.2.3.3, Matsumoto Lab, Nara In-stitute of Science and Technology.http://chasen.naist.jp/hiki/ChaSen/(4) The Mainichi Newspapers Corpus, year 2000,Mainichi Newspaper Co., Ltd.References[1] Takahiro Fukushima, Terumasa Ehara and Kat-suhiko Shirai.
