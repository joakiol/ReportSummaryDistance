REFLECTIONS ON 20 YEARS OF THE ACLAN INTRODUCTIONDonald E. WalkerArtificial In~elligence CenterSRI InternationalMenlo Park, California 94025, USAOur society was founded on 13 June 1962 asthe Association for Machine Translation andComputational Linguistics.
Consequently, this1982 Annual Meeting represents our 20thanniversary.
We did, Of course, change our nameto the Association for Computational Linguisticsin 1968, but that did not affect the continuity ofthe organization.
The date of this panel, 17June, misses the real anniversary by four days,but no matter; the occasion still allows us toreflect on where we have been and where we aregoing.
I seem to be sensitive to opportunitiesfor celebrations.
In looking through my AMTCL/ACLcorrespondence over the years, I came across acopy of a memo sent to Bob Simmons and HoodRoberts during our lOth anniversary year,recommending that something in commemoration mightbe appropriate.
I cannot identify anything in theprogram of that meeting or in my notes about itthat suggests they took me seriously then, butthat reflects the critical difference betweenvolunteering a recommendation and Just plainvolunteerlnglMy invitation to participate in this panelwas sent out to the presidents of the Association,who were, in order, Vic Yngve, Dave Hays, WinLehmann, Paul Garvin, Susumo Kuno, (I fit here inthe sequence), Martin Kay, Warren Plath, JoyceFriedman, Bob Simmons, Bob Barnes, Bill Woods,Aravind Joshi, Stan Petrick, Paul Chapin, JonAllen, RonKaplan,  Bonnie Webber, Norm Sondheimer,and Jane Robinson, and to my predecessor asSecretary-Treasurer, Hood Roberts.
HarryJosselson, our first Secretary-Treasurer, is nolonger among us, but he would have enjoyed such agathering, being one for ceremony and celebration.Vic, Dave, Martin, Warren, Joyce, BobSimmons, Bill, Aravind, Stan, Paul, Jon, Ron,Bonnie, and Norm agreed to Join me on the panel.Jane refused on the grounds that she was not yetpart of history and that her Presidential Addressprovided ample platform to convey her reflections.Win, Paul, Susumo, and Bob Barnes were not able tocome, and Hood was still waffling when this piecewas being written.
Vic, Dave, Win, Bob Simmons,Aravind, Paul, Jon, Norm, and I have written downsome of our reflections; they appear on thefollowing pages.My charge to the panelists, with respect toboth oral and written tradition, was quite broad:"You are asked to reflect on significantexperiences during your tenure of that office, inparticular as they reflect on the state ofcomputational linguistics then and now, andperhaps with some suggestions for what the futurewill bring."
The written responses are varied, asyou can see; I am sure that the oral responseswill prove to be equally so.To provide some perspective--and record somehistory, I am attaching a synopsis of "officers,editors, committees, meetings, and programchairing" (please let me know about errors!).
Itis interesting to note the names of people--manyof whom are still prominent in the field, thepractices associated with our annual meetings, andour publication history.
I will comment on thelatter two.Our first meeting was held in conjunctionwith the 1963 ACM National Conference, but it isclear that our primary allegiance has been withthe Linguistic Society of America, since we metseven times in conjunction with its summermeetings.
For a period, we alternated between theLSA and the Spring Joint Computer Conference--andactually included that schedule in our membershipflyer.
We Joined with the American Society forInformation Science twice, and the CognitiveScience Society once.
The convocation of thefirst International Conference on ComputationalLinguistics, now known popularly as COLING,replaced our annual meeting in 1965, and we arescheduled to host COLING-84 in two years.Recently, we have been meeting independently,reflecting an increased confidence in our abilityto "make it on our own!
"The publication history of the Associationhas been equally varied.
The Finite String, ournewsletter, was published as a separate under theeditorship of Hood Roberts from 1964 through 1973,and has continued in various forms ever since.
In1965, the Association adopted MT: MechanicalTranslation, a Journal founded by Vic Yngve in1954, changing its name to Mechanical Translationand Computational Linguistics in the process.However, that Journal was not able to sustain asufficient flow of manuscripts, and the lastissue, dated 1968, was published in 1970.
After alengthy exploration of an alternative primaryJournal, Dave Hays brought the American Journal ofComputational Linguistics into being in 1974.
Hi-asintention had been to create a printed Journalthat contained extended abstracts, supplemented bymicrofiches that provided details, programs, andcomputer listings.
This proposal was submitted tothe National Science Foundation for support.
Agrant was approved, but it stipulated that wepublish a microfiche-only Journal, and we did thatuntil 1978, The Finite String being issued as aseparate microfiche during this period.
It becameincreasingly clear during the five microficheyears that the micropublishing industry was notgoing to develop as predicted in the early 1970s.89Microfiche readers that were both inexpensive andconvenient had not materialized, and our memberswere reluctant to commit their manuscripts to amedium that restricted readership to a dedicatedfew.
Consequently, George Heldorn set aboutconverting the AJCL to a printed Journal, thefirst issue of which appeared in 1980.
Respectfulof its microformal origins, it is distributed witha microfiche that duplicates the printed versionbut sometimes contains additional material.
TheFinite Strin~ Newsletter continues to providegeneral information of interest to the membershipas a special section.To complete our publlcatlon history, I canannounce a new venture that the Association isJust beginning, Studies in Natural LanguageProcessln~, a monograph series under theEditorship of Aravlnd Joshl.
It was prompted byNorm Sondheimer and brought into being through theorganizatlonal efforts of Paul Chapln.
We areJust completing negotiations with CambridgeUniversity Press, which will publish it for us.So much for general history, I will reservemy proper place down the llne for other kinds ofcommentary.ASSOCIATION FOR MACHINE TRANSLATION ANDCOMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS(founded 6-13-1962)ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS(renamed 7-24-1968)Officers, Editors, Committees, Meetings,and
