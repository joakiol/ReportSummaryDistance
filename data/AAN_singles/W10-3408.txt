de Nantesjungyeul.park@univ-nantes.frAbstractThis paper is based on our efforts onautomatic multi-word terms extractionand its conceptual structure for multi-ple languages.
At present, we mainlyfocus on English and the major Ro-mance languages such as French, Span-ish, Portuguese, and Italian.
This pa-per is a case study for Italian language.We present how to build automaticallyconceptual structure of automatically ex-tracted multi-word terms from domainspecific corpora for Italian.
We showthe experimental results for extractingmulti-word terms from two domain cor-pora (?natural area?
and ?organic agri-culture?).
Since this work is still on-going, we discuss our future direction atthe end of the paper.1 IntroductionGreat progress has been recently obtained on us-ing text analysis to extract terms in a specificfield.
The study of texts helps in finding and or-ganizing textual segments representing concep-tual units.
A corpus is a collection of texts storedin an electronic database.
Texts have been se-lected to be representative of a particular goal.A corpus must be balanced in quality and quan-tity contents: in order to be representative of adomain, texts have to cover all the possible com-municative situations.
Generally, in a specialiseddomain, users share contents and they normallycan understand and communicate with each oth-ers without ambiguities.
However, when differ-ent communities get in touch the possibility ofmisunderstanding arises because of terminolog-ical variation.
This variation can be detected ata conceptual level or at the formal one.
Our ap-proach tries to overcome this problem by collect-ing different text typologies.
Texts may be ex-tracted from different sources which can be clas-sified as their specialisation level, their contents,their pragmatic application, etc.
In our case, weare interested in using different texts, in order toanalysis the result of automatic extraction in dif-ferent communicative situations to improve itsfunctioning.A term can be simple if composed by oneword, or complex if composed by several words.This paper focuses on extracting and concep-tually structuring multi-word terms for Italian.Collet (2000) affirmed that a complex term(multi-word term in our terminology) is a com-plex unit whose components are separated by aspace and are syntactically connected.
The re-sulting unit denominates a concept which be-longs to the language for special purposes (LSP).Texts on any domain are easily available on theWeb these days.
To create a corpus represent-ing a field, materials should be, however anal-ysed and re-elaborated in order to resolve even-tual problems arising the transfer of data.
Inparticular, a corpus have to be processed in or-der to classify the composing units.
This clas-sification represents the first step towards termi-nological extraction.
Terminologists must oftenlook through many texts before finding appropri-ate ones (Agbago and Barrire, 2005).
L?Homme(2004) presents guidelines for choosing termi-nology such as domain specificity, languageoriginality, specialization level, type, date, data48evaluation.1Since interaction between domains increasesconsistently, domain specificity is a crucial pointto considerer during the creation of a corpus.Text typologies and communicative situationsreflect their peculiarity to terms.
A concept canbe represented differently if the level of special-isation of a text or the context changes.
Here,we consider the context as the frame in whichthe communication takes place.
For example,the domain of ?natural area?, Italian language isreally interesting because terms register a highlevel of variations due to the different contexts.The LSP changes as the society evolves.Terms can register the diachronic variation dueto the development of a certain domain.
Theevolution of a domain influences also the termi-nologies which form LSP.
Terminological evolu-tion generates variations in the conceptual rep-resentation which should be observed in orderto detect terms and their variants and to estab-lish relations between them.
For example, thedomain of ?organic agriculture?
is now evolvingand changing because of political choices.
Thisaffects the terminology and the eventual creationof new forms.
The affix bio- which can be useas a variant of almost all multi-word terms con-cerning the biological production such as metododi produzione biologica (?method of organic pro-duction?)
becomes metodo bio and prodotto bio-logico (?organic product?)
becomes prodotto bioor just bio.In this paper, we present an approach for ex-tracting automatically multi-word terms (MWT)from domain specific corpora for Italian.
Wealso try to conceptually structure them, that is webuild the ?conceptual?
structure of variations ofmulti-word terms where we can learn dynamicsof terms (Daille, 2002).
Conceptual structure inthis paper limits to the semantic relationships be-tween terms such as Hyperonomy, Antony, Setof, and Result between multi-word terms and wecurrently implement only hyperonomy relations.Actually, this paper is based on our effortson automatic multi-word terms extraction and its1The translated text is adapted from Agbago and Barrire(2005)conceptual structure for multiple languages.
Atpresent, we mainly focus on English and the ma-jor Romance languages such as French, Span-ish, Portuguese, and Italian.
This paper is a casestudy for Italian language.
The remaining of thispaper is organized as follows: We explain howto automatically extract and conceptually struc-ture multi-word terms from domain specific cor-pora in the next section.
We also describe someimplementation issues and current advancement.Since this work is still on-going, we discuss ourfuture direction in the last section.2 Automatically Extracting andConceptually StructuringMulti-Word Terms2.1 ACABITTo extract automatically multi-word terms fromdomain specific corpora and conceptually struc-ture them for Italian, we adapt existing ACABITwhich is a general purpose term extractor.
Ittakes as input a linguistically annotated corpusand proposes as output a list of multi-word termcandidates ranked from the most representativeof the corpus to the least using the log-likelihoodestimation.2 ACABIT is currently available forEnglish and French as different programs foreach language.
Fundamentally, ACABIT worksas two stages: stat and tri.
At the stat,it allows us to identify multi-word terms in cor-pora to calculate the statistic.
At the tri, it al-lows us to sort and conceptually structure thembased on base terms.
For the moment, we reim-plement universal stat for major Romance lan-guages.
We explain the more detailed issues ofour reimplementation of ACABIT for Italian inSection 2.3.2.2 Base Term and its VariationsFor automatic multi-word term identification, itis necessary to define first the syntactic struc-tures which are potentially lexicalisable (Daille,2003).
We refer to these complex sequences asbase terms.
For Italian, the syntactic structure ofbase terms is as follows (where Noun1 is a head):2http://www.bdaille.fr49Noun1 Adj area protetta (?protected area?
),azienda agricola (?agricultural company?
)Noun1 Noun2 zona tampone (?buffer area?
)Noun1 di (Det) Noun2 sistema di controllo(?control system?
), conservazione deibiotopi (?biotope conservation?
)Besides these base term structures, there isalso [Noun1 a` Vinf ] for example for French.
ForItalian, there might be [Noun1 da Vinf ] such asprodotto biologico da esportare (?organic prod-uct to export?)
which is rather phraseology andnot a term.
Consequently, we define only threebase term structures for Italian for now.ACABIT for Italian should spot variations ofbase terms and puts them together.
For exam-ple, there are graphical variations such as casedifferences and the presence of an optional hy-phen inside of base term structures, inflexionalvariations where aree protette (?protected ar-eas?)
should be considered as the variation ofarea protetta (?protected area?
), or shallow syn-tactic variations which only modifies functionwords of the base terms, such as optional charac-ter of the preposition and article such as sistemadi informazione and sistema informativo (?infor-mation system?
).To conceptually structure identified multi-word terms, ACABIT for Italian should put to-gether syntactic variations which modify the in-ternal structure of the base term: internal mod-ification and coordination.
Internal modifica-tion variations introduce the modifier such asthe adjective in [Noun1 di Noun2] structure ora nominal specifier inside of [Noun1 Adj] struc-ture.
For example, qualita` ambientale (?envi-ronmental quality?)
and elevata qualita` ambien-tale (?high environmental quality?)
for [Noun1 diNoun2] structure and ingrediente biologico (?or-ganic ingredient?)
and ingrediente d?origine bi-ologico (?organic origin ingredient?)
for [Noun1Adj] structure .
Coordination variations coordi-nate or enumerate the base term structure, forexample habitat ntaurali (?natural habitat?)
andhabitat naturali e quasi naturali (?natural and al-most natural habitat?
)2.3 ImplementationTo keep consistent with the original ACABIT andto take an advantage of by directly using a certainpart of existing modules, we use the input and theoutput formats of ACABIT.
The input format ofACABIT requires the lemmatized forms of wordsfor detecting inflexional variations of multi-wordterms.
For example, putting together inflexionalvariations such as area protetta and aree protette(?protected area(s)?)
is easily predictable by us-ing their lemmatized forms.
The original ver-sion of ACABIT for French uses BRILL?s POStagger3 for POS tagging and FLEMM4 for restor-ing morpho-syntactic information and lemma-tized forms.
And for English, it uses BRILL?sPOS tagger and CELEX lexical database5 as alemmatiser.Since we are reimplementing ACABIT formultiple languages and we want to use the ho-mogeneous preprocessing for ACABIT, we useTREETAGGER6 which annotates both of part-of-speech tags and lemma information as prepro-cessor for .
Moreover, TREETAGGER is avail-able for several languages.
We, then adapt theresult of TREETAGGER for the input format forACABIT.
We use French POS tagger?s tagset(E?tiquettes de Brill94 Franc?ais INALF/CNRS)for every language, we convert TREETAGGERtagset into BRILL?s tagset.7Figure 1 shows the example of the input for-mat of ACABIT in XML makes use of whichconforms to Document Type Definition (DTD)in Figure 2.
In Figure 1, POS tags are followedby morpho-syntactic information and the lem-matized form of a token in each <PH>.8 TREE-TAGGER provide only lemmatized forms withPOS information, instead of providing its main3http://www.atilf.fr4http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/pers/namer/Telecharger Flemm.htm5http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/6http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/7http://www.lirmm.fr/?mroche/Enseignements/FdD M2P old/Etiqueteur/tags.html#francais inalf8For the convenience of the notations, accented charac-ters are sometimes presented as ?e and ?a for e` and a`,respectively in the Figure.50morphological features such as gender, number,person and case as FLEMM in the previous ver-sion of ACABIT.
We simply introduce dummymorphological information because it is not ac-tually used in ACABIT.
Note that e`/SYM/e` inFigure 1 is not correctly POS-tagged by TREE-TAGGER.
It is one of flexional forms of essere(?be?)
instead of the symbol (SYM).
However, wedo not perform any post-processing to correct er-rors and we leave it as it is analyzed for the mo-ment.In Figure 2, <CORPUS> is for the name ofthe corpus, <RECORD> is for different textswhich are usually from separate files, <INFO>has a format like <INFO>00/CAR/00 -/-0001800/SBC/0001800</INFO> with theyear of text creation 00 and the file identifica-tion 0001800.
<TITLE> is for the title, <AB>is for the text body, and <PH NB="num"> is forsentence identification.ACABIT proposes as output a list of multi-word terms ranked from the most representa-tive of the corpus using log-likelihood estima-tion (Dunning, 1993) and their variations in thecorpus.
It also shows the semantic relation be-tween multi-word terms.
The example of theoutput is given in Figure 3.
A base term, forexample area protetto (?protected area?)
is puttogether with its syntactic variations ?area nat-urale protetto (?natural protected area?)
and areamarino protetto (?marine protected area?).
Wecan rewrite them as Hyperonomy (area natu-rale protetto) = area protetto?
or Hyperonomy(area marino protetto) = area protetto becauseACABIT identifies that area protetto is a hyper-nym of area naturale protetto and area marinoprotetto as <MODIF>ied terms of <BASE>terms .
Likewise, a base term prodotto bio-logico (?organic product?)
has its syntactic varia-tion: internal modification such as prodotto nonbiologico (?non-organic product?
), prodotto ali-mentare non biologico (?non-organic alimentaryproduct?
), and prodotto ittico biologico (?organicfishing product?
), and coordination like prodottobiologico e non biologico (?organic and non-organic product?).
Moreover, there are Antonymrelation described as LINK type="Neg" be-tween the base terms and some of its syntacticvariations such as prodotto non biologico andprodotto alimentare non biologico.
Note thatoutput of ACABIT in Figure 3 only containscanonical forms of multi-word terms.2.4 ExperimentsCreation of domain specific corpora: For ourexperiments we crawl two domain corpora of?natural area?
domain which consists of 17,291sentences and 543,790 tokens from Gli E-Quaderni9 and 47,887 sentences and 1,857,914tokens from Parchi10.
We also crawl in the Inter-net to create the corpus of ?organic agriculture?which consists of 5,553 sentences and 150,246tokens from National legislations and Europeanlegislations for organic agriculture11.Automatic evaluation: Table 1 shows the statis-tics of experimental results from each domain.Since our domain corpora are mutually related,we count the common multi-word terms andthere are 600 unique terms (base terms + vari-ations) shared in both corpora.
This is 18.74%of the number of terms in ?organic agriculture?.Figure 4 shows example of these common terms.2.5 Current advancementTill now, we reimplement only stat for multi-ple languages.
To conceptually struture them, westill borrow tri of the previous ACABIT.
Wehave not implemented yet full features of statfor Italian neither because of the lack of morpho-syntactic rules.For example, the preposition inside of the termof [Noun1 di Noun2] structure might be equiva-lent to a prefix-added Noun2 such as deteriora-mento dopo la raccolta (?rot after harvest?)
vs.deterioramento post-raccolta (?post-harvestingrot?).
Likewise, the morphological derivation9http://www.parks.it/ilgiornaledeiparchi/e-quaderni-federparchi.html10http://www.parks.it/federparchi/rivista/11http://www.sinab.it/index.php?mod=normative politiche&smod=comunitarie&m2id=189&navId=196 and http://www.sinab.it/index.php?mod=normative politiche&smod=nazionali&m2id=189&navId=197,respectively.51<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><CORPUS><RECORD><INFO>00/CAR/00 -/- 0001800/SBC/0001800</INFO><TITLE> </TITLE><AB><PH NB="0"> La/DTN:_:s/la presente/ADJ:_:p/presente Ricerca/SBP:_:s/Ricerca?e/SYM/?e frutto/SBC:_:s/frutto di/PREP/di un/DTN:_:s/un lavoro/SBC:_:s/lavororealizzato/ADJ2PAR:_:s/realizzare da/PREP/da una/DTN:_:s/unapluralit?a/ADJ:_:s/pluralit?a di/PREP/di soggetti/SBC:_:p/soggetto -/SYM/-pubblici/ADJ:_:p/pubblico ,/, privati/ADJ:_:p/privato ,/, del/DTN:_:s/delmondo/SBC:_:s/mondo della/DTN:_:s/della ricerca/SBC:_:s/ricerca e/COO/edell?/DTN:_:s/dell?

Figure 5 shows exam-ples of rules of morpho-syntatic variations be-tween noun and adjectival endings for Italian,which they are independently provided as ex-ternal properties file for Italian.
In Figure 5,endings -zione (nominal) and -tivo (adjec-tival) mean that if there are adjective ended with-tivo like affermativo, the system searches forthe morphological derivation of a noun endedwith -zione like affermazione and put themtogether.
Only partial rules of morpho-syntaticvariations for Italian are presently integrated.
Wetry to find the exhaustive list in near future.3 Discussion, Conclusion and FutureWorkIn general, manual retrieval and validation ofterms is labor intensive and time consuming.The automatic or semi-automatic methods whichworks on text in order to detect single or multi-word terms relevant to a subject field is referredto as term extraction.
Term extraction producesthe raw material for terminology databases.
Itis a process which is likely to produce signifi-cant benefits in terms individuation.
The reasonswhich justify term extractions are:1. building glossaries, thesauri, terminologi-cal dictionaries, and knowledge bases; au-tomatic indexing; machine translation; andcorpus analysis rapidly.2.
Indexing to automatize information re-trieval or document retrieval.3.
Finding neologism and new concepts.Term extraction systems are usually catego-rized into two groups.
The first group is repre-sented by the linguistically-based or rule-basedapproaches use linguistic information such asPOS and chunk information to detect stop wordsand to select candidate terms to predefined syn-tactic patterns.
The second group is representedby the statistical corpus-based approaches se-lect n-gram sequences as candidate terms.
Theterms are selected by applying statistical mea-sures.
Recently, these two approach are com-bined.We implement ACABIT for Italian, whichuses the combined method to extract multi-wordterms and structure them automatically.
We in-troduce base term structures and their linguisticvariation such as graphical, inflexional, and shal-low syntactic variations.
We also consider themodification of the structure of base terms suchas internal modification using adjective and co-ordinate variations.
We evaluate on two domainspecific corpora mutually related ?natural area?and ?organic agriculture?
to extract multi-wordsterms and we find 600 unique terms shared inboth copora.
This paper is based on our effortson automatic multi-word terms extraction and itsconceptual structure for multiple languages andthis is a case study for Italian language.
Forthe moment, we reimplement universal stat formajor Romance languages.
Most of previouswork on extracting terms, especially for multiplelanguages are focusing on single-word terms andthey are also often based on statistical approachwith simple morphological patterns, for exam-ple Bernhard (2006), and Velupillai and Dalianis(2008).54Nominal ending Adjectival ending Examples-zione -tivo affermazione (?affirmation?)

)Figure 5: Example of rules of morpho-syntatic variations (noun-adjective)Since this work is still on-going, we con-sider only Hyperonomy relations as the con-ceptual relation where a relative adjective mod-ifies inside of the base term with [Noun1 Adj]or [Noun1 di Noun2] structures.
We also con-sider Antonym only with negative adverbs likenon.
There are still Antonym (e.g.
solubilita`micellare (?micellar solubilization?)
vs. insolu-bilita` micellare (?micellar insolubilisation?
)), Setof (e.g.
piuma d?anatra (?duck feather?)
vs. pi-umaggio dell?anatra (?duck feathers?
)), Result(e.g.
filettaggio del salmone (?salmon filleting?)vs.
filetto di salmone (?salmon fillet?))
rela-tionships.
ACABIT for French detects concep-tual relations by using morphological conflatingwhich implements stripping-recording morpho-logical rules.
We are planning to add these con-ceptual relationships in ACABIT for Italian innear future.AcknowledgmentThe authors would like to thank Be?atrice Daillewho kindly provide to us with ACABIT, for hervaluable remarks on an earlier version of this pa-per.
