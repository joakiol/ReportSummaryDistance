The acquisition of phonotactics rep-resents a distinguished and important stage of lan-guage acquisition.
In fact, in carefully controlledexperimental conditions, nine-month-old infantsalready react differently to licit and illicit soundcombinations (Jusczyk et al, 1993).
They thusdisplay knowledge of phonotactics already at anearly stage of language development.Usually, the problem of the acquisition of thephonotactics of a language given a finite set of lin-guistic data is formalized as the problem of find-ing a smallest language in the typology that isconsistent with the data (Berwick, 1985; Manziniand Wexler, 1987; Prince and Tesar, 2004; Hayes,2004; Fodor and Sakas, 2005).
Section 1 for-mulates the problem of the acquisition of phono-tactics along these lines within the mainstreamphonological framework of Optimality Theory(Prince and Smolensky, 2004; Kager, 1999).Unfortunately, (such a formulation of) the prob-lem of the acquisition of phonotactics in OT turnsout to be intractable (NP-complete): for any at-tempted efficient solution algorithm, there aresome instances of the problem where the algo-rithm fails (Magri, 2010; Magri, 2012b).
Thishardness result holds for the universal formulationof the problem, in the sense of Heinz et al (2009):there are no restrictions on the constraint set thatdefines the OT typology and indeed the OT typol-ogy itself figures as an input to the problem.There are two strategies to cope with this hard-ness result.
One approach weakens the formu-lation of the problem through proper restrictionson the constraint set: certain constraint sets areimplausible from a phonological perspective, andshould therefore be ignored in the proper formula-tion of the problem (Magri, 2011; Magri, 2012c).This approach raises interesting challenges, as itrequires a through investigation of the algorith-mic implications of various generalizations devel-oped by phonologists on what counts as a ?plausi-ble?
OT constraint set.
Another approach is to by-pass this difficulty, and weaken the formulation ofthe problem by lowering the standard for success:we settle on an approximate solution, namely a?small?
language rather than a smallest language.This paper paves the way for the latter approach.I focus on the specific formulation of the prob-lem of the acquisition of OT phonotactics devel-oped in Prince and Tesar (2004).
In Sections 2 and3, I show that this formulation of the problem canbe restated as a classical integer program, namelythe Assignment problem with liner side constraints(AssignLSCsPbm).
The theory of approximationalgorithms for integer programing is a bloomingfield of Computer Science (Bertsimas and Weis-mantel, 2005).
In particular, powerful approxi-mation algorithms have been recently developedfor the AssignLSCsPbm.
A state-of-the-art algo-rithm is due to Arora et al (2002).
The integerprogramming formulation developed in this paperthus paves the way for a new approximation ap-proach to the problem of modeling the acquisitionof phonotactics within OT.
In Magri (2012a), I re-port simulation results with Arora?s et.
al.
(2002)algorithm on various instances of the problem ofthe acquisition of phonotactics.521 Formulation of the problem1.1 Basic formulationA typology in Optimality Theory (OT) is definedthrough a 4-tuple ?
= (X ,Y, Gen,C), where Xis the set of underlying forms; Y is the set ofcandidate surface forms; Gen is the generatingfunction that pairs an underlying form x ?
Xwith a set Gen(x) ?
Y of surface forms calledthe candidates for x; and C is the set of n con-straints C1, .
.
.
, Cn.
Each constraint Ci is a func-tion that maps a pair (x, y) of an underlying formx ?
X and a candidate y ?
Gen(x) into a num-ber Ci(x, y), called the corresponding number ofviolations.
The constraint set is split into the sub-setM of markedness constraints and the subset Fof faithfulness constraints.
As the constraint set isfinite and can therefore only distinguish among afinite number of forms, I can assume that the set ofunderlying forms X is finite, as well as the candi-date set Gen(x) for any underlying form x ?
X .Let pi be a ranking, namely a total order overthe constraint set.
I denote by OTpi : X ?
Y theOT grammar corresponding to the ranking pi, asdefined in Prince and Smolensky (2004).
And Idenote by L(pi) the language corresponding to theranking pi, namely the range of the correspond-ing grammar OTpi (or, more explicitly, the set ofall and only those surface forms y?
?
Y such thatthere exists an underlying form x ?
X such thatOTpi(x) = y?).
Throughout the paper, I use x for anunderlying form, y?
for a surface form which is anintended winner, and y for a surface form which isan intended loser.The Problem of the acquisition of phonotacticsin OT can be stated as in (1) in its universal for-mulation (Berwick, 1985; Manzini and Wexler,1987; Prince and Tesar, 2004; Hayes, 2004).
Weare given an OT typology as well as a finite setP ?
X ?
Y of linguistic data.
These data consistof pairs (x, y?)
of an underlying form x ?
X and acorresponding intended winner form y?
?
Gen(x).I assume that P is consistent, namely that thereexists at least a ranking pi such that OTpi(x) = y?for every pair (x, y?)
?
P .
We are asked to returna ranking pi which has two properties.
First, pi isconsistent: the corresponding OT grammar mapsx into y?
for every pair (x, y?)
?
P .
Second, pi isrestrictive: there exists no other ranking pi?
consis-tent with P too such that the language L(pi?)
cor-responding to pi?
is a proper subset of the languageL(pi) corresponding to pi.
A solution algorithmneeds to run in time polynomial in the number ofconstraints |C| and the numbers of forms |X |, |Y|(recall that X and Y are finite).
(1) given: an OT typology ?
= (X ,Y, Gen,C)and a finite set P ?
X ?
Y of data;find: a ranking pi s.t.
P ?
OTpi and there isno pi?
s.t.
P ?
OTpi?
and L(pi?)
?
L(pi);time: max{|C|, |X |, |Y|}.Problem (1) is NP-complete: there exists no effi-cient algorithm that is able to solve any instance ofthe problem (Magri, 2010; Magri, 2012b).An interesting variant of the problem (1) as-sumes that we are given only the surface forms butnot the corresponding underlying forms.
Princeand Tesar (2004) and Hayes (2004) suggest thatwe can circumvent this difficulty as follows.
As-sume that the set of underlying forms and theset of surface forms coincide, namely X = Y .Assume furthermore that the typology is outputdriven (Tesar, 2008): a surface form y?
belongs tothe languageL(pi) corresponding to a ranking pi iffthe corresponding grammar OTpi maps that form y?
(construed as an underlying form) into itself (con-strued as a surface form), as stated in (2)(2) y?
?
L(pi) ??
OTpi(y?)
= y?.In this case, a way to cope with the lack of theunderlying forms is to assume that the underlyingform corresponding to a given surface form y?
isthe completely faithful underlying form y?
itself.For this reason, I stick with the formulation (1) ofthe problem, whereby we are provided with bothsurface and underlying forms.1.2 ERC notationConsider an underlying form x ?
X and two dif-ferent candidate forms y, y?
?
Gen(x), with theconvention that y?
is the intended winner for xwhile y is a loser.
Following Prince (2002), allthe relevant information concerning the underly-ing/winner/loser form triplet (x, y?, y) can be sum-marized into the corresponding elementary rank-ing condition (ERC), namely the n-tuple e withentries e1, .
.
.
, en ?
{L, e,W} defined as in (3).
(3) (x, y?, y) =?
e = e1 .
.

enei.=??
?W if Ci(x, y?)
< Ci(x, y)L if Ci(x, y?)
> Ci(x, y)e if Ci(x, y?)
= Ci(x, y)53In words, The ith entry ei is ei = W iff con-straint Ci assigns more violations to (x, y) than to(x, y?)
and thus favors the intended winner y?
overthe loser y; ei = L iff the opposite holds; finally,ei = e iff the constraint Ci assigns the same num-ber of violations to the two pairs (x, y) and (x, y?
).A ranking pi can be represented as a permuta-tion over {1, .
.
.
, n}, with the understanding thatpi(i) = j means that the ranking pi assigns con-straint Ci to the jth stratum of the ranking, withthe convention that the stratum corresponding toj = n (to j = 1) is the top (bottom) of the rank-ing.
For every such permutation pi, let epi be then-tuple e with the components reordered accord-ing to pi in decreasing order, as in (4).
(4) epi.= (epi(n), .
.
.
, epi(1))The ERC e is OT-consistent with pi provided theleft-most component of epi different from e is a W.For each of the pairs (x, y?)
in the set P givenwith an instance of the problem (1), consider eachloser candidate y ?
Gen(x) different from y?,construct the ERC corresponding to the underly-ing/winner/loser form triplet (x, y?, y) as in (3) andorganize all these ERCs one underneath the otherinto an ERC matrix with n columns and manyrows (the order of the ERCs does not matter).
Idenote a generic ERC matrix by E and I say thata ranking pi is OT-consistent with E provided it isconsistent with each of its ERCs.
The problem ofthe acquisition of phonotactics in (1) can thus beequivalently restated in ERC notation as in (5).
(5) given: an OT typology ?
= (X ,Y, Gen,C)and an ERC matrix E;find: a ranking pi s.t.
pi is OT-consistent withE and there is no pi?
consistent with Etoo s.t.
L(pi?)
?
L(pi);time: max{|C|, |X |, |Y|}.The latter formulation of the problem is only par-tially stated in terms of ERC notation, as the con-dition L(pi?)
?
L(pi) still requires knowledge ofthe entire OT typology.
This difficulty is tackledin the next Subsection.1.3 Restrictiveness measuresLet a restrictiveness measure be a function ?which takes a ranking pi and returns a number?
(pi) ?
N that provides a relative measure of thesize of the language L(pi) corresponding to pi, inthe sense that the (strict) monotonicity property in(6) holds for any two rankings pi, pi?.
(6) If L(pi?)
?
L(pi), then ?(pi?)
< ?
(pi).Any solution of the optimization problem (7) is asolution of the corresponding instance (5) of theproblem of the acquisition of phonotactics.
In fact,if pi solves (7) then there cannot exist any otherranking pi?
consistent with the ERC matrix thatcorresponds to a smaller language L(pi?)
?
L(pi),since (6) would imply that ?(pi?)
< ?
(pi), contra-dicting the hypothesis that pi is a solution of (7).
(7) minimize: ?
(pi);subject to: pi is OT-consistent with the givenERC matrix E;time: number of columns and rows of E.As problem (7) is stated completely in terms ofthe ERC matrix E, the time required by a solutionalgorithm needs to scale just with the size of E.From now on, I will focus on the new formu-lation (7).
Thus, I need a restrictiveness measure(6).
Of course, not just any restrictiveness mea-sure will do.
For instance, the function (8), whichpairs a ranking pi with the cardinality of its lan-guage L(pi), trivially satisfies (6).
(8) ?
(pi) .= |L(pi)|.Yet, this is not a good restrictiveness measure, be-cause there seems to be no way to compute ?
(pi)without actually computing the language L(pi),which requires knowledge of the entire typology.Prince and Tesar (2004) suggest a better can-didate, which is defined for any ranking pi as in(9).
Recall that the constraint set C = F ?
Mis split up into the subset F of faithfulness con-straints and the subset M of markedness con-straints.
For each faithfulness constraint F ?
F ,determine the number ?
(F ) of markedness con-straints M ?
M ranked by pi below that faithful-ness constraint, i.e.
pi(F ) > pi(M).
Finally, addup all these numbers ?
(F ) together to determinethe value ?(pi).
(9) ?
(pi) .=?F?F???
{M ?M|pi(F ) > pi(M)}????
??
??
(F )Is the function ?
defined in (9) is a restrictive-ness measure?
namely, does it satisfy condition(6)?
Prince and Tesarconjecture that it is, basedon the following intuition.
Markedness (faith-54fulness) constraints work against (towards) thepreservation of the underlying contrasts.
Thus, asmall (large) language should arise by ranking themarkedness (faithfulness) constraints as high aspossible.
And a ranking that ranks the markedness(faithfulness) constraints as high (low) as possi-ble is a ranking that minimizes Prince and Tesar?sfunction (9).I endorse Prince and Tesar?s conjecture that (9)is a restrictiveness measure, at least for the cases ofinterest.1 In Magri (2012a), I backup this claim bylooking at a case study, namely the typology cor-responding to the large constraint set considered inPater and Barlow (2003).
In the rest of this paper, Ithus focus on the reformulation (7) of the problemof the acquisition of phonotactics, with ?
definedas in (9).
The latter formulation of the problem ofthe acquisition of phonotactics is NP-complete too(Magri, 2010; Magri, 2012b).
In the rest of thispaper, I thus develop an integer programming for-mulation of the latter problem, that allows approx-imation algorithms for integer programming to beused in order to tackle the problem of the acquisi-tion of phonotactics.
The reasoning is split up intotwo steps.
In Section, 2, I develop an integer pro-gramming formulation of the objective function,namely the alleged restrictiveness measure in (9).And in Section 3, I turn to an integer programmingformulation of the OT-consistency condition.2 An integer programming restatementof the restrictiveness measureA square matrix of order n is a collection ofn2 real numbers displayed into n columns and1 Prince and Tesar?s conjecture that (9) is a restrictive-ness measure runs into a straightforward problem when theconstraint set C contains both positional and faithfulness con-straints.
Yet, there are various ways to circumvent this diffi-culty posed by positional constraints.
One way could be toweigh differently the two types of faithfulness constraints inthe determination of restrictiveness.
Thus, we could switchfrom the definition in (9) to the variant in (i), where Fpos isthe set of positional faithfulness constraints,Fgen is the set ofgeneral faithfulness constraints and ?
is a positive coefficient.
(i) ??(pi).=?F?Fpos????

?Another way to deal with positional faithfulness constraintscould be to ignore altogether rankings where a positionalfaithfulness constraint is ranked below the correspondinggeneral faithfulness constraint.
This is trivial to obtain, byadding a proper ERC to the ERC matrix given with an in-stance of the problem (7).n rows.
I denote a square matrix of order n asX = [xi,j ]ni,j=1, with the understanding that xi,jis the element of the matrix X which sits in theith row and the jth column.
I denote by Rn?n thevector space of all square matrices of order n.A square matrix X = [xi,j ]ni,j=1 is called a per-mutation matrix iff its elements xi,j satisfy the fol-lowing three conditions: (i) they are all 0 or 1; (ii)each column contains a unique 1; (iii) each rowcontains a unique 1.
I denote by Pn the set of alln!
permutation matrices of order n. To illustrate, Ilist Pn with n = 3 in (10).
(10)[1 0 00 1 00 0 1] [1 0 00 0 10 1 0] [0 1 01 0 00 0 1][0 0 11 0 00 1 0] [0 1 00 0 11 0 0] [0 0 10 1 01 0 0]Permutation matrices play a special role in convexgeometry (Webster, 1984, par.
5.8).There is a natural correspondence between per-mutation matrices of order n and rankings over nconstraints C1, .
.
.
, Cn.
Recall that a ranking piis a permutation over {1, 2, .
.
.
, n}, with the un-derstanding that pi(i) = j means that the rank-ing pi assigns the constraint Ci to the jth stratum,with the convention that the stratum correspond-ing to j = n is the top stratum.
I use i as theindex ranging over constraints and j as the in-dex ranging over strata.
Thus, a ranking pi canbe identified with that (unique) permutation ma-trix X = [xi,j ]ni,j=1 ?
Pn such that xi,j = 1 iff theranking pi assigns the constraint Ci to the jth stra-tum, namely pi(i) = j.
To illustrate, I list in (11)the rankings over {C1, C2, C3} corresponding tothe six permutation matrices in (10), respectively.

?The following Claim 1 explains how to computethe restrictiveness ?
(pi) of a ranking pi accordingto (9) out of the corresponding permutation ma-trix Xpi; see Appendix A.1.
This Claim shows animportant property of Prince and Tesar?s restric-tiveness measure: it can be described as a linearfunction over the set of permutation matrices.Claim 1 The restrictiveness ?
(pi) of a ranking piaccording to (9) can be computed as follows:(15) ?

1)which does not depend on the ranking.2 2I have noted in footnote 1 that the conjecture that thefunction ?
in (9) is a restrictiveness measure runs into prob-lems for constraint sets that contain both general and posi-tional faithfulness constraints.
And I have suggested that apossible way out is to to switch from the definition (9) to thevariant in (i).
Let me now point out that the latter variant toocan be described as a linear function over permutation ma-trices.
In fact, let ?n,m,?
be as the matrix ?n,m definedThe problem of the acquisition of phonotactics(7) with Prince and Tesar?s alleged restrictivenessmeasure (9) can thus be restated as the optimiza-tion problem (16).

Pn and piX is consis-tent with the given ERC ma-trix E.Here, I have dropped the constant 12m(m ?
1)which appears in (15), as it does not affect the op-timization problem.3 An integer programming formulationof the OT-consistency conditionThe reformulation in (16) makes use of the notionof OT-consistency with a given ERC matrix andthis notion is currently stated in terms of rankingsrather than in terms of the corresponding permu-tation matrices.
We need to restate the latter con-dition directly in terms of permutation matrices.In this Section, I point out two strategies for do-ing that.
The first approach hinges on a classicalobservation by Prince and Smolensky (2004) thatOT consistency can be restated as linear consis-tency in the case of exponentially spaced weights.The second approach requires a larger number oflinear conditions, but is shown to provide a betterreformulation (i.e.
a tighter relaxation).3.1 An initial formulation of OT-consistencyGiven an ERC e = [e1, .
.
.
, en], consider thecorresponding square matrix Ae = [ai,j ]ni,j=1 ?Rn?n defined in (17).
Here, ti is the sign of theERC?s entry ei, namely ti is equal to ?1, 0 or+1 depending on whether ei is equal to L, e orW.
Thus, the entry ai,j in the ith row and the jthcolumn of the matrix (17) consists of the sign timultiplied by 2j .

?Intuitively, this entry ai,j = 2jti is the weight ofthe sign ti under the assumption that the constraintabove, but with the rows corresponding to general faithful-ness constraints multiplied by ?.
Then, ??
(X) coincideswith ?
?n,m,?,X?, but for a constant.56Ci is assigned to the jth stratum.The following claim offers a restatement ofOT-consistency between an ERC and a rankingin terms of the permutation matrix correspond-ing to that ranking.
This claim is just a re-statement in matrix form of the observation byPrince and Smolensky (2004) that OT consistencyis equivalent to a linear condition with exponen-tially spaced weights; see Subsection A.2.Claim 2 A ranking pi is OT-consistent with anERC e iff ?Ae,Xpi?
?
0, where ?Ae,Xpi?
is thescalar product (12) between the matrix Ae corre-sponding to the ERC e and the permutation matrixXpi corresponding to the ranking pi.
The current formulation (16) of the problem ofthe acquisition of phonotactics can thus be restatedas the optimization problem in (18).
(18) FIRST INTEGER REFORMULATION:minimize: ??n,m,X?
;subject to: X?Pn s.t.
?Ae,X?

0 for ev-ery ERC e of the ERC matrix E.Problem (18) is an optimization problem over per-mutation matrices X?Pn.
The objective functionis the linear function ??n,m,X?.
And the feasi-ble set is defined in terms of linear side condi-tions ?Ae,X?

0.
Problem (18) is thus an in-teger program.
In particular, it is an Assignmentproblem with linear side constraints (AssignLSC-sPbm) (Bertsimas and Weismantel, 2005).3.2 Another formulation of OT-consistencyLet `(e) be the number of entries equal to L inan ERC e = [e1, .

Assume without lossof generality that `(e) > 0, as ERCs with no L?scan be ignored.

The current formulation (16) of the problem ofthe acquisition of phonotactics can thus be alter-natively restated as the optimization problem (20).

The feasible set in the latter formulation(20) involves n times more inequalities than theformulation (18).3.3 Comparing the two formulationsProblems (18) and (20) are two different formula-tions of the original problem (16) of the acquisi-tion of phonotactics.
They are thus equivalent, inthe sense that a solution to any of the two prob-lems is also a solution to the other and further-more to the original problem.
This Subsectionexplains why, nonetheless, the latter formulation(20) is better than the former formulation (18).Both (18) and (20) are optimization problemsover permutation matrices X ?

{0, 1}in (21).
This condition can be relaxed, requiringthe entires xi,j to be not necessarily 0 or 1 but in-stead any number in between 0 and 1.
Thus, letPnrel be the set of matrices that satisfy the relaxedconditions (22), known as the Birkhoff polytope.

, n}.These linear programs (23) and (24) are the relax-ations of the two integer programs (18) and (20).The relaxation of an integer program providesa lower bound on the solution of that integer pro-gram.
This lower bound is used by solution al-gorithms for the integer program.
Of course, lin-ear relaxations that provide tight bounds yield im-proved solution algorithms for the original integerproblem (Bertsimas and Weismantel, 2005).
De-spite the fact that the two original integer programs(18) and (20) are equivalent, the two correspond-ing relaxations (23) and (24) are not.
Claim 4 en-sures that the feasible set of the relaxation (24) isa subset of that of the relaxation (23), so that thelower bound provided by a solution of the formerwill be at least as tight as the lower bound providedby a solution of the latter.Claim 4 If a matrix X belongs to the feasible setof problem (24), then it also belongs to the feasibleset of problem (23).
The following counterexample shows that thelower bound provided by the relaxation (24) isnot just as tight as but actually tighter than thebound provided by the relaxation (23).
Given theERC matrix (25), the solution to the correspondingproblem (7) is the ranking F2  M  F1: thefaithfulness constraint F1 is redundant and shouldtherefore be ranked at the bottom.
(25) E =[F1 F2 MW W Le W L]The solutions of the two corresponding relaxations(23) and (24) are provided in (26).33These solutions have been computed with the Mat-lab codes RelaxedSubPbmFirstFormulation.m andRelaxedSubPbmSecondFormulation.m, that solvethe two relaxations (23) and (24), respectively.
These codesare available on the author?s website.
The two codes use thetwo subroutines MatrixToVectorConverter.m andVectorToMatrixConverter.m, that are available onthe author?s website too.

?The relaxation (23) has a non-integral solution; therelaxation (24) is thus stronger because its solutionis integral.
The latter solution indeed representsthe desired ranking, as it assigns F2 to the top 3rdstratum (because of the 1 in the second columnand third row) and F1 to the bottom 1st stratum(because of the 1 in the first row and first column).4 ConclusionIn this paper, I have focused on Prince and Tesar?s(2004) formulation (7) of the problem of the ac-quisition of phonotactics, in terms of the allegedrestrictiveness measure (9).
This problem is NP-complete.
To cope with this hardness result, in thispaper I have looked for an integer programmingformulation of the latter problem.
The formulationin (20) has emerged as the best formulation amongthose considered, namely the one that yields thetightest relaxation.
This problem (20) is an in-stance of a classical integer program, namely theAssignment problem with linear side constraints(AssignLSCsPbm).
The result obtained in this pa-per thus paves the way for the efficient applicationof approximation algorithms for the AssignLSC-sPbm to the problem of the acquisition of phono-tactics in OT.

There are seven constraints (hence n = 7),four of which are faithfulness constraints (hencem = 4).
I have fringed each row of X with thename of the constraint it corresponds to and I have58fringed each column of X with the stratum it cor-responds to.
(27) X =?????????
?st1 st2 st3 st4 st5 st6 st7F1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0F2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0F3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0F4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1M5 0 0 0 1 0 0 0M6 1 0 0 0 0 0 0M7 0 0 0 0 1 0 0?????????
?As prescribed by our conventions, the first fourrows correspond to the four faithfulness con-straints, the bottom three rows correspond to themarkedness constraints; the leftmost column cor-responds to the bottom stratum and the rightmostcolumn corresponds to the top stratum.The ranking piX that corresponds to X can beobtained as follows: the 1 in the first column ofX says that the markedness constraint M6 is as-signed by piX to the bottom stratum j = 1; the 1in the second column of X says that the faithful-ness constraint F1 is assigned to the next stratumj = 2; and so on.
Thus, piX is the ranking (28).
(28) F4  F2 M7 M5  F3  F1 M6According to (9), the restrictiveness ?
(piX) of thisranking piX is 8 = 3+3+1+1: 3 markedness con-straints underneath F4, another 3 underneath F2, 1underneath and F3 as all as underneath F1.
Hereis a way to quickly compute this number directlyfrom the permutation matrix X.Consider the matrix (29) obtained from the ma-trix (27) through the following two steps.
First, all1?s which appear in the bottom three rows of X(and thus correspond to markedness constraints)are replaced with 0?s.(29)?????????
?st1 st2 st3 st4 st5 st6 st7F1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0F2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0F3 0 0 2 0 0 0 0F4 0 0 0 0 0 0 6M1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0M2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0M3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0?????????
?Second, each 1 which appears in one of the topfour rows of X (and thus corresponds to a faith-fulness constraint) is replaced with the numberwhich identifes the corresponding column, dimin-ished by 1.
Thus for example, the 1 in the secondrow in the matrix X in (27) is replaced by a 5 in(29), since it occurs in the sixth column.Next, let?s scan the columns of the matrix (29)from left to right, assigning to each column whichis not all zeros a progressive index k starting fromk = 0, as made explicit in (30).(30)?????????
?k1=0 k3=1 k2=2 k4=3F1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0F2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0F3 0 0 2 0 0 0 0F4 0 0 0 0 0 0 6M1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0M2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0M3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0?????????
?Now we can straightforwardly read out of (30) thenumber of markedness constraints ranked by piXbelow each faithfulness constraint: F1 has onlyone markedness constraint ranked below it, whichis precisely the number i1 = 1 which appears inthe row corresponding to F1 diminished by thevalue k1 = 0 which corresponds to the columnwhere that number appears; F2 has three marked-ness constraints ranked below it, which is pre-cisely the number i2 = 5 which appears in therow corresponding to F2 diminished by the valuek2 = 2 which corresponds to the column wherethat number appears; and so on.Since ?
(piX) is defined in (9) as the sumover each faithfulness constraint of the number ofmarkedness constraints ranked below that faithful-ness constraint, we get the right result as in (31).

(piX) ==(i1 + i2 + i3 + i4)?
(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)=(i1 + i2 + i3 + i4)?
(0 + 1 + 2 + 3)It is trivial to check directly from the definition(12) of scalar product that the first term i1 + i2 +i3+ i4 in the second line of (32) is the scalar prod-uct ??7,4,X?
between the permutation matrix Xin (27) and the matrix ?7,4 in (14).
Thus, the firstterm in the second line of (32) corresponds to thefirst term in (15).
It is also trivial to check that the59second term 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 in the second line of(32) is equal to 12m(m?
1) for m = 4.
Thus, thesecond term in the second line of (32) correspondsto the second term in (15).A.2 Proof of claim 2Consider a ranking pi, namely a permutation over{1, .
.
.
, n}.
Let pi?1 be its inverse.
Recall thatpi(i) = j means that constraint Ci is assignedby the ranking pi to the jth stratum, with the topstratum being the one corresponding to j = n.Thus, pi?1(j) is the constraint assigned by pi to thejth stratum.
Given an ERC e = [e1, .

, en], letk = k(e) ?
{1, .

.
.
, n all havean e in the ERC e so that the constraint assignedby pi to the kth stratum is the highest one that doesnot have an e in the ERC.
(33) a. epi?1(k+1) = .
.
.
= epi?1(n) = e.b.
epi?1(k) 6= e.Thus, pi is OT-consistent with the ERC e iffepi?1(k) = W. To prove Claim 2, I thus provethe equivalence (34), where Xpi = [xi,j ]ni,j=1 isthe permutation matrix corresponding to pi andAe = [ai,j ]ni.j=1 is the matrix defined in (17).
(34) ?Ae,Xpi?
> 0 ??
epi?1(k) = W.Assume that epi?1(k) = W; then I can reason asfollows, following Prince and Smolensky (2004):(35)?Ae,Xpi?
=n?i,j=1xi,jai,j =n?i,j=1xi,j2jti=n?i=1tin?j=1xi,j2j =n?i=1ti2pi(i)=n?j=1tpi?1(j)2j > 2k ?k?1?j=12j > 0The proof of the reverse implication is analogous.A.3 Proof of claim 3To illustrate why claim 3 holds, consider the con-crete case of the ERC e in (36).
(36) t =[C1 C2 C3 C4 C5W W e e L]A ranking pi is OT-consistent with this ERC e pro-vided it ranks either C1 or C2 above C5.
This con-dition is equivalent to the set of implications (37).For example, the the third implication says that if,pi assigns C5 to either stratum 3, or 4 or 5 (thelatter being the top stratum), then pi must assigneither C1 or C2 to either stratum 4 or 5.

?Consider the permutation matrix X = [xi,j ]n=5i,j=1.Recall that xi,j = 1 iff the corresponding rank-ing pi satisfies the condition pi(i) = j namely itassigns constraint Ci to the jth stratum.
Thus,the implications in (37) can be restated in termsof permutation matrices rather than rankings as in(38), in the sense that a ranking pi satisfies (37) iffthe corresponding permutation matrix Xpi satisfies(38).

0 enforcedby the relaxation (23) boils down to the inequal-ity (39).
In order to prove claim 4 in this specificcase, I thus need to show that, if X ?
Pnrel satis-fies inequalities (38), then it also satisfies inequal-ities (39).
Indeed, the last inequality in (38) saysthat x5,5 is null, and can thus be dropped from theother four inequalities (38).
Multiplying the firstinequality in (38) by 4, the second by 4, the thirdby 8 and the fourth by 16, I get (40).
Summingthe inequalities (40) together, I get the inequality(41).
As xi,j ?
0, I can weaken the inequality (41)by dividing the left hand side by 2 and by adding2x1,1 and 2x2,1 to the right hand side, thus obtain-ing the desired inequality (39).ReferencesSanjeev Arora, Alan Frieze, and Haim Kaplan.
