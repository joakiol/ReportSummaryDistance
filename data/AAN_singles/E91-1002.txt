COMPARATIVES AND ELL IPSISs.
G. PuhnanSRI International, and University of Cambridge Computer LaboratorySRI International Cambridge Computer Science Research Centre23 Miller's Yard, Cambridge CB2 1RQsgp@cam.sri.comABSTRACTThis paper analyses the syntax and seman-tics of English comparatives, and some typesof ellipsis.
It improves on other recent analy-ses in the computational linguistics literature inthree respects: (i) it uses no tree- or logical-formrewriting devices in building meaning represen-tations (ii) this results in a fully reversible lin-guistic description, equally suited for analysis orgeneration (iii) the analysis extends to types ofelliptical comparative not elsewhere treated.INTRODUCTIONMany treatments of the English comparativeconstruction have been advanced recently in thecomputational linguistics literature (e.g.
Raynerand Banks, 1989; Ballard, 1988).
This interestreflects the importance of the construction formany natural language applications, especiallythose concerning access to databases, where it isnatural to require information about quantita-tive differences and limits which are most nat-urally expressed in terms of comparatives andsuperlatives.However, all of these analyses have their de-fects (as no doubt does this one).
The most per-vasive of these defects is one of principle: theyall place a high reliance on non-compositionalmethods (tree or formula rewriting) for assem-bling the logical forms Of comparatives even incases that might be thought to be straightfor-wardly compositional.
These devices mean thatthe grammatical descriptions involved lack, tovarying extents, the important property of re-versibility: they can only be used to analyse, notto generate, expressions of comparison.
This isa serious restriction on the practic,'d usefulnessof such analyses.The analysis presented here of the syntaxand compositional semantics of the main instancesof the English comparative and superlative is in-tended to provide a fairly theory-neutral 'off theshelf' treatment which can be translated intoa range of current grammatical theories.
Themain theoretical claim is that by factoring outthe compositional properties of the constructionfrom the various types of ellipsis also involved, acleaner treatment can be arrived at which doesnot need any machinery specific to this construc-tion.. A semantics in terms of generalised quan-tifiers is proposed.SYNTAXIntuitively, a sentence like:John owns more horses than Bill ownsseems to consist of two sentences ascribing ownsership of horses, together with a comparison ofthem, where some material has been omitted.Despite appearances, however, this pre-theoreticalintuition is ahnost wholly wrong, both syntacti-cally, and, as we shall see, semantically.
Thesequence 'more horses than Bill owns' is in factan NP, and a constituent of the main clause, ascan be seen from the fact that it can appear asa syntactic subject, and be conjoined with othersimple NPs:\[More horses tha~ Bill owns\] are soldevery dayJohn, Mary, and \[more linguists thanthey could cope with\] arrived at thepartyIn order to accommodate example like thesewe must analyse the whole sequence as an NP,with some internal structure approximately asfollows.
(We use a simple unification grammarformalism for illustration, with some obvious no-tational abbreviations).NP\[-comp\] -> NP\[+comp,postp=P,<feats~,R>\]S ' \[+comp, postp=P, <feats=R>\]A \[+comp\] NP is one like:a nicer horse, a less nice horse, lessnice a horse, several horses moreseveral more horses, as many horses,at least 3 mot,  I,,:~rses, etc.-2 -We will not go into details of the internalstructure of these NPs, other than to requirethat whether the comparative lement is a de-terminer or an adjective, the dominating NPcarries feature values which characterise it as acomparative NP, and which enforce 'agreement'between comparative pre- and post-particles (-er/than,as/as,  etc.)
via the variable 'P' .
We as-sume that NPs marked as comparative in thisway are not permitted elsewhere in the gram-nlar.In the case of the \[+comp\] S' constituent,there are several possibilities.
Some forms ofcomparative can be regarded as straightforwardexamples of unbounded dependency construc-tions:... more horses than Bill ever dreamedhe would own _... more horses than Bill wanted ~ torun in the raceThese involve Wh-movement of NPs.
The see-ond type involving a lnissing determiner depen-dency:John owns more horses than Bill owns_ sheepThere were more horses in the fieldthan there were _ sheep.Rules of the following form will generate \[+comp\]sentences of this type, using 'gap-threading' tocapture the unboullded dependency:S' \[+comp,postp=P, <feats=R>\] ->COMP \[form=P\]S \[-comp, gapIn= \[CAT \[<f eat s=R>\] \], gapOut= \[\] \](.here CAT is either NP or Det)As well as these 'movement'  colnparativesare those involving ellipsis:John owns more horses than Bill/Billdoes~does Bill/sheep.Name a linguist with more publica-tions than Chomsky.lie looks more intelligent with his glassesoff than on.It is noteworthy that sentences like the sec-ond of these dernonstra.te that the appropriatelevel at.
which ellipsis is recovered is not syn-tactic, but semantic: there is no syntactic con-stituent in the first portion of the sentence thatcould form an appropriate antecedent.
We there-fore do not attempt o provide a syntactic mech-anism for these cases, but rather regard them ascontaining another instantiation of an S' \[7+compJintrodnced by a rule:S'\[+comp\] -> COMP S\[+ellipsis, -comp\]An elliptical sentence is not a constituent re-quired solely for comparatives, but is needed toaccount for sentence fragments of various kinds:John, Which house?, Inside, On thetable, Difficult to do,John doesn't, He might not want to,etc.All of these, as well as more complex se-quences of fragments (e.g. '
IBM, tomorrow' inresponse to 'Where and when are you going?
')need to be accommodated in a grammar.Very many cases of this type of ellipsis canbe analysed by allowing an elliptical S to consistof one or more phrases (NP, PP, AdjP, AdvP)or their corresponding lexical categories.
Mostother commonly occurring patterns can be cateredfor by allowing verbs which subcategorise for anon-finite VP (modals, auxiliary 'do', 'to') to ap-pear without one, and by adding a special exicalentry for a main verb 'do' which allows it to con-stitute a complete VP.
Depending, of course, onother details of the grammar in question the lat-ter two moves will allow all of the following tobe analysed:Will John?, John won't, He may do,tie may not want to, Is he going to?etc.With this treatment of ellipsis, our syntax willbe able to analyse all the examples of compara-tives above, and many more.
It will also, how-ever, accept examples like:John owns more horses than inside.Bill is happier than John won't.for there is no syntactic connection betweentile main clause and the elliptical sentence.
Weassume that some of these examples may actu-ally be interpretable given the right context: atany rate, it is not the business of syntax to stig-matise them as unacceptable.Comparatives with adjectives and adverbialphrases, are, mulalis mulandis, exactly analo-gous to those with NPs, and we omit discussionof them here.-3 -SEMANTICSIn tile interests of fanailiarity the analysis willbe presented as far as possible in an 'intension-less Montague' framework: a typed higher orderlogic.Firstly, we need tile notion of a generalisedquantifier.
It is well known that most, if notall, complex natural anguage quantifiers call beexpressed as relations between sets.
Specifically(Barwise and Cooper, 1981) a quantifier with arestriction R and a body B can be expressed asa relation on the sizes of the set satisfying R,and the set which represents the intersection ofthe sets satisfying R and B.
A quantifier like 'all'can be represented using the relation =, and so asentence like 'all men are mortal', in a convenientnotation, will translate as:quant(~nna.n=m,)~x.man(x),)tx.mortal(x))(In logical forms, lower case variables will be oftype e, and upper case variables will be of typee--~t unless indicated otherwise.
All functionsare 'curried': thus Sxy.P is equivalent to SxAy.P.Read expressions like 'quant(Q,R,B)' as 'the re-lation Q holds between the size of the set de-noted by R, and the size of the set denoted bySx.lLx&Bx'.
This latter is tile intersection set.The important hing to note at this point isthat the relation Q can be arbitrarily complex,as it needs to be in order to accommodate de-terminers like 'at least 4 but not more than 7'.The second important hing to notice is that formany quantifiers, we are only interested in thesize of the intersection set, and thus tile firstlambda variable in Q will be vacuous.
Thus'some' can be expressed as the relation ')mm.m_ 1', as in 'some men snore':quant(,~nnl.m > 1, )~x.man(x)/~x.snore(x))In tile case of the movement types of compara-tive we can give the semantics in a wholly com-positional way by building up generalised quan-tilters which contain tile comparison.
Informally,the gist of the analysis is that in a sentence like'Jolm owns more horses than Bill owns', thereis a generalised quantifier characterising the setof horses that John owns as being greater thanthe set of horses that Bill owns.
hfformally, wecan think of the complenaent of a comparativeNP as a complex determiner:John owns \[more than Bill owns\] horses(Ill this respect, as in the use of generalisedquantifiers, this analysis yields logical forms some-what similar to those of Rayner and Banks, 1989).rio build these quantifiers we assume that thevarious relations signalled by the comparativeconstruction are part of the quantifier.
Thus thefinal analysis of the example sentence is:quant($nm.more(rn,Sx.horse(x)& own(Bill,x)),)~y.horse(y),)~z.own(John,z))'More' (or 'less' or 'as') is the relation used tobuild the quantifier.
To avoid notational clutterwe call assume that 'more' is 'overloaded', andcan take as its arguments either a number, oran expression of type e---,t, in which case it isinterpreted as taking the cardinality of the setdenoted by that expression.
'More' in fact takesa third argument, which is another quantifierrelation.
Thus the meaning of a sentence like'john owns at least 3 more horses than Bill owns'would get a logical form likequant(Anm.more(m,Aab.b_> 3,Ax.horse(x)&own(Bill,x)),Ay.horse(y),Xz.own(john,z))The way to read this is 'the relation of beingmore (by a number greater than or equal to 3)than the size of the set of horses owned by Bill,hol:ds of the set of horses owned by John'.
Wherethis extra argument to 'more' is not explicit, weassume it defaults to 'greater than 0'.
Itowever,we;shall ignore this refinement in the illustra-tioias that follow).~Note that this quantifier is only interested inthe intersection set: this is always true of com-parative quantifiers.
:We now give the meanings of each constituentinvolved in a couple of examples, along with therelevant rules, in skeletal form.
We indicate thetrail of gap threading using the 'slash' notation.For the purposes of this illustration we use theanalysis of the semantics of unbounded epen-dencies from Gazdar, Klein, Pullum and Sag(1985): a constituent C containing a gap of cat-egory X is of type X---,C. So given a tree of theform \[A \[B C\]\] which might normally \],ave asthe interpretation of A as B applied to C, theinterpretation of a tree \[A/X \[B C/X\]\] would be',~X.B(C(X))'.
Since gaps themselves are anal-ysed as identity fimctions this will have the righttype.-4 -/NPIJohnS\VP/ \V NPI / \omas NP S '/ \ /Det Nbar Comp/ f fmore horses than\s /sP/ \HP VP/NPI I \Bill V NP/NPI Jowns  eThe relevant rules and sense entries in schematicform are:S --* NP  VP  : NP(VP)VP - .

N is an NP  type variable; D aDet type variable, as are their primed versions.Notice that comparative determiners and theirNPs are of higher type than non-comparativeNPs, at least for those analyses which analyserelative clauses as modifiers of Nbar rather thanNP.
Constituent meanings are assembled by therules above as follows:\ [NP+cemp more horses\]:AQR.quant  (Anm.more(m,Ax.horse(x)&: Q(x)),Ay.horse (y),Az.it(x))\ [VP /NP  owns ,\]:AG.\[ANx.N (Ay.owns (x,y))\] (\[AN'.N'\] G)= AG.Ax.G (Ay.owns(x~y))\ [S /NP Bill owns el:AG'.\[AP.P (bill)/(\[AG.Ax.G (Ay.owns(x,y))\] G' )= AG'.G'(Ay.owns (bill,y))IS' than Bill owns el:= Ax.\[AG'.G'(Ay.owns (bill,y)/(AP.P (x))= Ax.owns(bill,x)\[NP \[more horses\]\[S' than Bill owns el:AR.quant(Anm.more(m,Ax.horse(x) Y., own(bil l ,x)),Ay.horse(y),Az.R(z))The remainder of the sentence is straightforward.The second example for illustration is:John owns more horses than Bill owns.
sheep.For the subdeletion cases, a fully compositionaltreatment demands a separate sense entry for'more', since the Nbar of the NP  in which 'more'appears does not occur inside the comparativequantifier:APQR.quant  (Anm.more(m, Ax.Qx),Ay.Py, Az.Rz)We do not have to multiply syntactic ambigui-ties: the appropriate sense entry can be selectedby passing down into the NP  a syntactic fea-ture value indicating whether tile following S'contains an NP  or a Det gap.
Constituents areassembled as follows: remember that D has thetype of ordinary determiners: (e--+t)--,((e---+t)---~t).\ [NP /Det  e sheep\]: AD.D(As.sheep(s))\ [VP/Det  owns ?

These arethe 'quasi logical forms' (QLF) of Alshawi andvan Eijck (1989), differing from 'resolved logi-cal forms' (RLF) in several respects: they con-tain 'a_terms' representing the memlings of pro-nouns and other contextually dependent NPs;'a.fornm' (anaphoric formula) representing themeanings of sentences containing contextuallydetermined predicates (possessives, compoundnominals, 'have' 'do' etc); and 'q_terms' rep-resenting the meaning of other quantified NPsbefore the later explicit quantifier scoping phase(see Moran 1988).
QLFs are fleshed out to RLFsvia a process of contextually guided inference(Alshawi, 1990).
Since ellipsis is clearly a con-textually deternfined aspect of interpretation weextend the 'a_form' construct to provide a QLFfor elliptical sentences, and treat the process ofinterpretation asakin to reference resolution forpronouns.Take a sequence like (A) 'Who came.'?'
(S)'John'.
We represent the meaning of the 'miss-ing' constituent by an 'a_form' binding a vari-able of the appropriate type to combine with themeaning of the 'present' constituents o form anexpression of the appropriate ype for the S' con-stituent containing the ellipsis.
Thus the mean-ing of the two utterances will be represented as:past(come(who))a_form(P,P(john))One can think of 'a_form' as asserting that thereis such a P: resolution finds *that P. For consis-tency with the Montague notation we are usingwe will indicate an 'a_form' variable as a freevariable: 'P (john)'.for P. In this example the only possibility is thatP = Ax.past(come(x)).
Thus the meaning of theelliptical sentence after resolution is:\[Ax.past (come(x))\] (john)= past(come(john))The theoretical advantages of higher-orderunification in the interpretation of ellipsis areamply documented in Dalrymple, Shieber, andPereira (forthcoming).
More details of our owntreatment are in Alshawi et hi.
(forthcoming).This analysis of inter-sentential ellipsis gen-eralises cleanly to intra~sentential ellipsis, in par-ticular the comparative cases discussed above:the only difference is that location of the 'con-text' is not trivial, since the ellipsis is, as it were,contained in the logical form that yields the con-text.
As an example, the NP in 'Name a linguistwith \[more publications than John\]' will have astructure:\[NP \[NP more publications\] \[S' than\[S-I-elliptical \[NP John\]\]\]\]The meaning of the elliptical S will be as above,but the appropriate version of the semantics forthe S' rule will (as was the case with the analy-sis of the movement comparatives given earlier)have to arrange things so that the type of thewhole elliptical S' expression is e---*t. Thus thevariable representing the ellipsis will be of typee---*(e---~t), assuming that 'john' in this contextis of type e. Omitting some of the details, themeaning of the entire NP will then be:AR.quant(Anm.more(m,Ax.publications(x) ~" \[P(john)\](x)),Ay.publicatlons(y), Az.R(z))where the meaning of the elliptical S' \[P(john)\]figures in the second term of the comparison af-The ellipsis resolution method uses a tech- ter beta~reduction.
Tile meaning for the wholenique which is formally a restricted type of higher- sentence, again taking some short cuts will he:order unification (Ituet 1975).
Ellipsis resolutionproceeds ill three steps.
Firstly, we have to finda 'context', which in the case of intersententialellipsis is the logical form of the preceding utter-ance.
Next, one or more 'parallel' elements arefound in this context.
In the example above, itwould be 'who'.
This step is somewhat analo-gous to the establishing ofprououn antecedents,and may be similarly sensitive to properties likeagreement, focus, sortal restrictions, etc.
Whenthe parallel element(s) have been found, the nextstep abstracts over the position(s) of the ele-ment(s), and suggests the result as a candidatename(hearer,linguist) &quant(Anm.more(m,Ax.publications(x) ~ \[P(john)\](x)),Ay.publlcations(y), Az.have(linguist,z))We now have to find a suitable context for el-lipsis resolution.
The only candidate xpressionwith an element parallel to 'john' is 'Az.have(linguist,z)'.Abstracting over the parallel element gives us'Alz.have(l,z)', which is an appropriate candidatefor P. After substituting and reducing the finalmeaning of the whole sentence will be:-6 -name(hearer , l inguist )  ?zquant  (Anm.more(m,Ax.publications(x) ~ have(john,x)) ,Ay.publications(y), Az.have(llnguist~z))In reality, of course, the details are more com-plex than this, but this semi-formal reconstruc-tion should convey the basic principles.
Nowwe have succeeded in analysing all the types ofcomparative so far discussed using either purelyIMPLEMENTATION STATUSMorphology, syntax and compositional seman-tics for NP, AdjP and AdvP comparatives ofboth movement and ellipsis types have been fullyimplemented, as well as some other common typesof comparative not mentioned here (e.g.
Nbarcomparatives like 'more men than women').
El-lipsis resolution has been implemented for theinter-sentential cases, but not, at the time ofwriting, for the intra-sentential cases.

Further-more, once we have this type of ellipsis mecha-nism in place, it is a simple matter to extend itto account for comparatives in which the wholecomparison is missing:John has 2 more horses.There are at least as many sheep.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work was supported by the CLARE con-sortium: BT, BP, the Information EngineeringDirectorate of the DTI,  RSRE Malvern, and SRIInternational.
I thank Hiyan Alshawi for hismany substantial contributions to the analysesdescribed here, and Jan van Eijck and MannyAs Rayner and Banks somewhat ruefully note, Rayner for comments on an earlier draft.these are in many texts by far the most corn-monly encountered form of comparative, althoughtheir analysis, in common with others, fails tohandle them.Syntactically, what we do is to give the vari-ous comparative morphemes an analysis in whichthey are marked as \[-comparative\].
Thus a phraselike 'at least as many sheep' will be analysed aseither a + or - comparative NP.
In the first case,tile syntax will only permit it to occur with anexplicit complement, as detailed above, and inthe second case the syntax will prevent an ex-plicit complement occurring.
Semantically, how-ever, the second contains an elliptical compari-son.
Thus the meaning of 'more'  in this type ofcomparative will be:AP Q.quant (Anm.more(m,2x.
