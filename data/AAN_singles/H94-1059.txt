ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES  FOR LANGUAGE LEARNING:  DEVELOPMENTS ATARIMelissa HollandManger, Language ProgramU.S.
Army Research InstituteAlexandria, VA 22333-5600The: Program in Advanced Technologies forLanguage Learning at ARI seeks to develop andtest foreign language tutors through contractualresearch by computational linguists and in-houseresearch by ARI psychologists.
The program aroseout of a technology push to integrate NLP withintelligent tutoring systems, coupled with a need inthe U.S. Army for interactive systems to train andsustain mission-critical l nguage skills that involveproduction as well as comprehension f language.The need for improved foreign languageproficiency in functional areas, beyond the corelanguage training provided at the DefenseLanguage Institute, is threefold: (a) to maintainjob-relevant language skills by intelligencepersonnel, (b) to promote communication amongmultinational forces in coalition operations atcommand and control and lower levels, and (c) tosupport peacekeeping missions and operationsother than war.Driven by army requirements, ARI's programimposes the constraints of compactness,accessibility, and extendibility on a language tutor:It must run on readily available PCs, it must betailorable by instructors to address changingscenarios of language use, and it must bepotentially extendible across languages through theuse of principled NLP formalisms.
Meeting thesegoals has required a series of tradeoffs with powerand depth of analysis in the NLP and tutoringcomponents ofARrs systems.
The ARI program isclassified as exploratory development (6.2), andwhile its products are prototypes, they arenevertheless intended for near-term use inlanguage l arning labs and research settings.The program has completed evelopment of aGerman tutor, equipped with multimedia interfaceand question-answer exercises overlying a parserand medium-size l xicon.
Students' responses toquestions are parsed and syntactic errors arereported to the tutor for flexible delivery tostudents.
An authoring front-end enablesnonprogrammers (instructors and instructionalresearchers) to add and change lessons, and todecide how, whether, and when to presentgrammatical feedback.
A second tutor for Arabicand Spanish is now in development that addsimmersion-like exercises involving graphicsmicroworlds and constrained dialog.
Theseexercises are supported by lexical conceptualstructures (LCSs) for semantic analysis, an LCSeditor usable by trained instructors, and aknowledge base and discourse tracker built withtools from ARPA's Planning Initiative.
Theprogram has so far demonstrated the extendibilityof a principled-based parser from German toArabic through parametefization of the basicformalism, as well as the scalability of LCSsoriginally developed for a demonstration machinetranslation system.
All products, includingmulfilingual parsers and lexicons, are available foruse in other NLP applications by other developers.In addition, ARI is pursuing dual use developmentto transfer its language tutoring technology intopublic schools and universities.ARI's program is scheduled for completion at theend of FY95.
Promising directions for futureapplication of human language technology tolanguage tutors include incorporating continuousspeech recognition in a range of target languagesand continuing the development of dialog andNLP-dnven animated graphics.In-house work to date includes user trials witharmy intelligence students and instructors,development of schemas for lesson design toexploit he capabilities and limitations of the NLP,and initiation of joint research with universitylanguage labs on the effects of tutoring variables,such as the level of detail and scheduling ofgrammatical feedback, with respect o individualdifference characteristics of learners.302
