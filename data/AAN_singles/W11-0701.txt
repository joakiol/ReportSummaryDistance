HerringSchool of Library & Information Science and Department of LinguisticsIndiana UniversityBloomingtonherring@indiana.eduAbstractA growing body of research analyzes the linguistic and discourse properties of communication inonline social media.
Most of the analysis, especially at the discourse level, is done manually byhuman researchers.
This talk explores how the findings and techniques of computer-mediated dis-course analysis (CMDA), a paradigm I have been developing and teaching for 18 years, can in-form computational approaches to communication in social media.
I start by reviewingestablished automation approaches, which mainly focus on structural linguistic phenomena, andemergent approaches, such as machine learning models that identify semantically- and pragmati-cally-richer phenomena, through the lens of CMDA, pointing out the strengths and limitations ofeach.
The basic problem is that patterns in the discourse of social media users can be identified byhumans that do not appear to lend themselves to reliable automated identification using existingapproaches.
To begin to address this problem, I draw on examples of recent work on Twitter,Wikipedia, and web-based discussion forums to suggest an approach that synthesizes linguistical-ly-informed manual analysis and existing automated techniques.
I consider how such an approachcould scale up, while still making use of human analysts, and I identify a number of real-worldproblems that automated CMDA could help address.1
