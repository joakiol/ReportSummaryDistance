Interpreting the human genome sequence, using stochastic grammarsRichard DurbinThe Sanger CentreWellcome Trust Genome CampusHinxtonCambridge CB10 1SAUKrd@sanger.ac.ukAbstractThe 3 billion base pair sequence of the human genome is now available, and attention is focusing onannotating it to extract biological meaning.
I will discuss what we have obtained, and the methodsthat are being used to analyse biological sequences.
In particular I will discuss approaches usingstochastic grammars analogous to those used in computational linguistics, both for gene finding andprotein family classification.
