Although a formidable amount ofresearch have been done, the existing re-ported solutions or available systems arestill far from perfect or do not meet the sa-tisfaction level of end users?.
The main is-sue is the various conceptual rules thatgovern sentiment and there are even moreclues (possibly unlimited) that can conveythese concepts from realization to verbali-zation of a human being.
Human psycholo-gy directly relates to the unrevealed cluesand governs the sentiment realization of us.Human psychology relates many thingslike social psychology, culture, pragmaticsand many more endless intelligent aspectsof civilization.
Proper incorporation of hu-man psychology into computational senti-ment knowledge representation may solvethe problem.
In the present paper we pro-pose a template based online interactivegaming technology, called Dr Sentiment toautomatically create the PsychoSenti-WordNet involving internet population.The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extensionof SentiWordNet that presently holds hu-man psychological knowledge on a few as-pects along with sentiment knowledge.1 IntroductionIn order to identify sentiment from a text, lexicalanalysis plays a crucial role.
For example, wordslike love, hate, good and favorite directly indicatesentiment or opinion.
Previous works (Pang et al,2002; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Baccianella et.al., 2010) have already proposed various tech-niques for making dictionaries for those sentimentwords.
But polarity assignment of such sentimentlexicons is a hard semantic disambiguation prob-lem.
The regulating aspects which govern the lexi-cal level semantic orientation are natural languagecontext (Pang et al, 2002), language properties(Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmaticknowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005), time dimen-sion (Read, 2005), colors and culture (Strapparavaand Ozbal, 2010) and many more unrevealed hid-den aspects.
Therefore it is a challenging andenigmatic research problem.The current trend is to attach prior polarity toeach entry at the sentiment lexicon level.
Prior po-larity is an approximation value based on heuristicsbased statistics collected from corpus and not ex-act.
The probabilistic fixed point prior polarityscores do not solve the problem completely ratherit places the problem into next level, called contex-tual polarity classification.We start with the hypothesis that the summationof all the regulating aspects of sentiment orienta-tion is human psychology and thus it is a multi-faceted problem (Liu, 2010).
More precisely whatwe mean by human psychology is the union of allknown and unknown aspects that directly or indi-rectly govern the sentiment orientation knowledgeof us.
The regulating aspects wrapped in thepresent PsychoSentiWordNet are Gender, Age,City, Country, Language and Profession.The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension of theexisting SentiWordNet 3.0 (Baccianella et.
al.,2010) to hold the possible psychological ingre-dients and govern the sentiment understandabilityof us.
The PsychoSentiWordNet holds variableprior polarity scores that could be fetched depend-ing upon those psychological regulating aspects.50An example with the input word ?High?
may illu-strate the definition better:Aspects (Profession)   PolarityNull     PositiveBusinessman    NegativeShare Broker   PositiveIn this paper, we propose an interactive gaming(Dr Sentiment) technology to collect psycho-sentimental polarity for lexicons.
This technologyhas proven itself as an excellent technique to col-lect psychological sentiment of human societyeven at multilingual level.
Dr Sentiment presentlysupports 56 languages and therefore we may call itGlobal PsychoSentiWordNet.
The supported lan-guages by Dr Sentiment are reported in Table 1.In this section we have philosophically arguedabout the necessity of developing PsychoSenti-WordNet.
In the next section 2 we will describe thetechnical details of the proposed architecture forbuilding the lexical resource.
Section 3 explainsabout some exciting outcomes of PsychoSenti-WordNet.
The developed PsychoSentiWordNet(s)are expected to help automatic sentiment analysisresearch in many aspects and other disciplines aswell and have been described in section 4.The datastructure and the organization are described in sec-tion 5.
The conclusion is drawn in section 6.2 Dr SentimentDr Sentiment1 is a template based interactive on-line game, which collects player?s sentiment byasking a set of simple template based questions andfinally reveals a player?s sentimental status.
DrSentiment fetches random words from Senti-WordNet synsets and asks every player to tellabout his/her sentiment polarity understanding re-garding the concept behind the word fetched by it.There are several motivations behind developingthe intuitive game to automatically collect humanpsycho-sentimental orientation information.In the history of Information Retrieval researchthere is a milestone when ESP game2 (Ahn et al,2004) innovated the concept of a game to automat-ically label images available in the World WideWeb.
It has been identified as the most reliablestrategy to automatically annotate the online im-1http://www.amitavadas.com/Sentiment%20Game/index.php2http://www.espgame.org/ages.
We are highly motivated by the success ofthe Image Labeler game.A number of research endeavors could be foundin the literature for creation of Sentiment Lexiconin several languages and domains.
These tech-niques can be broadly categorized into two classes,one follows classical manual annotation techniques(Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006);(Wiebe and Ri-loff, 2006) while the other follows various auto-matic techniques (Mohammad et al, 2008).
Bothtypes of techniques have few limitations.
Manualannotation techniques are undoubtedly trustablebut it generally takes time.
Automatic techniquesdemand manual validations and are dependent onthe corpus availability in the respective domain.Manual annotation techniques require a large num-ber of annotators to balance one?s sentimentality inorder to reach agreement.
But human annotatorsare quite unavailable and costly.Sentiment is a property of human intelligenceand is not entirely based on the features of a lan-guage.
Thus people?s involvement is required tocapture the sentiment of the human society.
Wehave developed an online game to attract internetpopulation for the creation of PsychoSentiWord-Net automatically.
Involvement of Internet popula-tion is an effective approach as the population isvery high in number and ever growing (approx.360,985,492) 3 .
Internet population consists ofpeople with various languages, cultures, age etcand thus not biased towards any domain, languageor particular society.
A detailed statistics on theInternet usage and population has been reported inthe Table 2.The lexicons tagged by this system are credibleas it is tagged by human beings.
It is not a staticsentiment lexicon set [polarity changes with time(Read, 2005)] as it is updated regularly.
Around10-20 players each day are playing it throughoutthe world in different languages.
The averagenumber of tagging per word is about 7.47 till date.The Sign Up form of the ?Dr Sentiment?
gameasks the player to provide personal informationsuch as Sex, Age, City, Country, Language andProfession.
These collected personal details of aplayer are kept as a log record in the database.The gaming interface has four types of questiontemplates.
The question templates are named asQ1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.3http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm51LanguagesAfrikaans Bulgarian Dutch German Irish Malay Russian ThaiAlbanian Catalan Estonian Greek Italian Maltese Serbian TurkishArabic Chinese Filipino Haitian Japanese Norwegian Slovak UkrainianArmenian Croatian Finnish Hebrew Korean Persian Slovenian UrduAzerbaijani Creole French Hungarian Latvian Polish Spanish VietnameseBasque Czech Galician Icelandic Lithuanian Portuguese Swahili WelshBelarusian Danish Georgian Indonesian Macedonian Romanian Swedish YiddishTable 1: LanguagesWORLD INTERNET USAGE AND POPULATION STATISTICSWorld Regions Population ( 2010 Est.

These images have beenretrieved by Google image search API 4  and toavoid biasness we have randomized among thefirst ten images retrieved by Google.2.1 Gaming StrategyDr Sentiment asks 30 questions to each player.There are predefined distributions of each questiontype as 11 for Q1, 11 for Q2, 4 for Q3 and 4 forQ4.
These numbers are arbitrarily chosen and ran-domly changed for experimentation.
The questionsare randomly asked to keep the game more inter-esting.
For word based translation Google transla-tion5 service has been used.
At each Question (Q)level translation service has been used to displaythe sentiment word into player?s own language.Google API provides multiple senses for word lev-el translation and currently only the first sense hasbeen picked automatically.2.2 Q1An English word from the English SentiWordNetsynset is randomly chosen.
The Google imagesearch API is fired with the word as a query.
Animage along with the word itself is shown in theQ1 page of the game.4http://code.google.com/apis/imagesearch/5http://translate.google.com/Players press the different emoticons (Figure 1)to express their sentimentality.
The interface keepslog records of each interaction.ExtremePositive Positive Neutral NegativeExtremeNegativeFigure 1: Emoticons to Express Player?s Senti-ment2.3 Q2This question type is specially designed for relativescoring technique.
For example: good and betterboth are positive but we need to know which one ismore positive than other.
Table 3 shows how inSentiWordNet relative scoring has been made.With the present gaming technology relative polar-ity scoring has been assigned to each n-n word paircombination.Randomly n (presently 2-4) words have beenchosen from the source SentiWordNet synsetsalong with their images as retrieved by GoogleAPI.
Each player is then asked to select one ofthem that he/she likes most.
The relative score iscalculated and stored in the corresponding log ta-ble.Word Positivity NegativityGood 0.625 0.0Better 0.875 0.0Best 0.980 0.0Table 3: Relative Sentiment Scores in Senti-WordNet522.4 Q3The player is asked for any positive word in his/hermind.
This technique helps to increase the cover-age of existing SentiWordNet.
The word is thenadded to the existing PsychoSentiWordNet andfurther used in Q1 to other users to note their sen-timentality about the particular word.2.5 Q4A player is asked by Dr Sentiment about any nega-tive word.
The word is then added to the existingPsychoSentiWordNet and further used in Q1 toother users to note their sentimentality about theparticular word.2.6 Comment ArchitectureThere are three types of Comments, Comment type1 (CMNT1), Comment type 2 (CMNT2) and thefinal comment as Dr Sentiment?s prescription.CMNT1 type and CMNT2 type comments are as-sociated with question types Q1 and Q2 respective-ly.2.6.1 CMNT1Comment type 1 has 5 variations as shown in theComment table in Table 4.
Comments are random-ly retrieved from comment type table according totheir category:?
Positive word has been tagged as negative (PN)?
Positive word has been tagged as positive (PP)?
Negative word has been tagged as positive (NP)?
Negative word has been tagged as negative (NN)?
Neutral.
(NU)2.6.2 CMNT2The strategy here is as same as the CMNT 1.Comment type 2 has only two variations as.?
Positive word has been tagged as negative (PN)?
Negative word has been tagged as positive (NP)2.7 Dr Sentiment?s PrescriptionThe final prescription depends on various factorssuch as total number of positive, negative or neu-tral comments and the total time taken by anyplayer.
The final prescription also depends on therange of the accumulated values of all the abovefactors.This is the most important appealing factor to aplayer.
The motivating message for players is thatDr Sentiment can reveal their sentimental status:whether they are extreme negative or positive orvery much neutral or diplomatic etc.
It is notclaimed that the revealed status of a player by DrSentiment is exact or ideal.
It is only to make theplayers motivated but the outcomes of the gameeffectively helps to store human sentimental psy-chology in terms of computational lexicon.A word previously tagged by a player is avoidedby the tracking system during subsequent turns bythe same player.
The intension is to tag more andmore words involving Internet population.
We ob-serve that the strategy helps to keep the game in-teresting as a large number of players return toplay the game after this strategy was implemented.3 Senti-MentalityPsychoSentiWordNet gives a good sketch to un-derstand the psycho-sentimental behavior of thehuman society depending upon proposed psycho-logical dimensions.
The PsychoSentiWordNet isbasically the log records of every player?s taggedwords.3.1 Concept-Culture-Wise AnalysisThe word ?blue?
gets tagged by different playersaround the world.
But surprisingly it has beentagged as positive from one part of the world andnegative from another part of the world.
Thegraphical illustration in Figure 2 may explain thesituation better.
The observation is that most of thenegative tags are coming from the middle-east andespecially from the Islamic countries.PN PP NP NN NUYou don?t like<word>!Good you have a goodchoice!
Is <word> good!Yes <word> is toobad!You should speak outfrankly!You should like<word>!
I love <word> too!I hope it is a badchoice!
You are quite right!You are too diplomat-ic!But <word> is a gooditself!
I support your view!I don?t agree withyou!I also don?t like<word>!Why you hiding fromme?
I am Dr Senti-ment.Table 4: Comments53We found a line in Wiki6 (see in Religion Section)that may provide a good explanation: ?Blue in Is-lam: In verse 20:102 of the Qur?an, the word ??
?zurq (plural of azraq 'blue') is used metaphoricallyfor evil doers whose eyes are glazed with fear?.But other explanations may be there for this situa-tion.
This is an interesting observation that sup-ports the effectiveness of the developedPsychoSentiWordNet.
This information could befurther retrieved from the developed source by giv-ing information like (blue, Italy), (blue, Iraq) or(blue, USA) etc.Figure 2: Geospatial Senti-Mentality3.2 Age-Wise AnalysisAnother interesting observation is that sentimental-ity may vary age-wise.
For better understanding welook at the total statistics and the age wise distribu-tion of all the players.
Total 533 players have takenpart till date.
The total number of players for eachrange of age is shown at the top of every bar.Figure 3: Age-Wise Senti-MentalityIn Figure 3 the horizontal bars are divided into twocolors (Green depicts the Positivity and Red de-picts the negativity) according to the total positivi-ty and negativity scores, gathered during playing.6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueThis sociological study gives an idea on the varia-tion of sentimentality with age.
This informationmay be retrieved from the developed source bygiving information like (X, 36-39) or (X, 45-49)etc where X denotes any arbitrary lexicon synset.3.3 Gender-Wise AnalysisIt is observed from the collected statistics thatwomen are more positive than men!
The variationsin sentimentality among men and women areshown in the following Figure 4.Figure 4: Gender Specific Senti-Mentality3.4 Other-WiseWe have described several important observationsin the previous sections and there are other impor-tant observations as well.
Studies on the combina-tions of the proposed psychological dimensions,such as, location-age, location-profession andgender-location may reveal some interesting re-sults.4 Expected Impact of the ResourceUndoubtedly the generated PsychoSentiWord-Net(s) are important resources for senti-ment/opinion or emotion analysis task.
Moreoverthe other non linguistic psychological dimensionsare very much important for further analysis aswell as for several newly discovered sub-disciplines such as: Geospatial Information retriev-al (Egenhofer, 2002), Personalized search (Gauchaet al, 2003), Recommender System (Adomaviciusand Tuzhilin, 2005), Sentiment Tracking (Tong,2001) etc.5 The Data Structure and OrganizationDeciding on the data structure for the PsychoSen-tiWordNet was not trivial.
Presently RDBMS (Re-lational Database Management System) has been54used.
Several tables are being used to keep user?sclicking log and their personal information.As one of the research motivations was to gen-erate up-to-date prior polarity scores across variousdimensions, we decided to generate web serviceAPI through which the people can access latestprior polarity scores.
The developed PsychoSenti-WordNet is expected to perform better than a staticsentiment lexicon.6 Conclusion and Future DirectionsIn the present paper the development of the Psy-choSentiWordNet for 56 languages has been de-scribed.
No evaluation has been done yet as thereis no data available for this kind of experimenta-tion and to the best of our knowledge this is thefirst endeavor where sentiment analysis meets AIand psychology.Our present goal is to collect such corpus andcarry out experiments to check whether variableprior polarity scores of PsychoSentiWordNet excelover the fixed point prior polarity score of Senti-WordNet.Automatically picked first sense from Googletranslation API may cause difficulties for crosslingual projection of sentiment synsets.
Erroneousoutputs from API may also cause some problems.But these problems lead to another research issuethat may be termed as cross lingual sentiment syn-set linking.
Presently we are giving a closer look tothe qualitative analysis of developed multilingualpsycho-sentiment lexicons.AcknowledgmentThe work reported in this paper was supported by agrant from the India-Japan Cooperative Program(DST-JST) Research project entitled ?SentimentAnalysis where AI meets Psychology?
