j pAbst rac tThis paper describes an approach to ex-tract the aspectual information of Japaneseverb phrases from a monolingual corpus.We classify Verbs into six categories bymeans of the aspectual features which aredefined on the basis of the possibility ofco-occurrence with aspectual forms and ad-verbs.
A unique category could be identi-fied for 96% of the target verbs.
To evalu-ate the result of the experiment, we exam-ined the meaning of -leiru which is one ofthe most fundamental spectual markers inJapanese, and obtained the correct recog-nition score of 71% for the 200 sentences.1 IntroductionAspect refers to the internal temporal structure ofevents and is distinguished from tense, which has adeictic element in it, of reference to a point of timeanchored by the speaker's utterance.
There is a vo-luminous literature on aspect within linguistics andphilosophy.
Recently, computational linguists alsohave joined in the act within the context of machinetranslation or text understanding etc.
For example,consider the following Japanese sentences (quotedfrom (Gunji, 1992)).(a).
Ken-wa ima tonarino heya-de kimono-wo ki-te-i-ru.Ken-TOP now next room-LOC kimono-ACC put-on-PRES'Ken is now putting on kimono in the next room.'(b).
Ken-wa kesa-kara zutto axto kimono-wo ki-te-i-ru.Ken-TOP this morning-since always that kimono-ACC weax-PRES'Ken has been wearing that kimono since this morn-ing.'(e).
Ken-wa ano kimono-wo san-nen maeni ki-te-i-ru.Ken-TOP that kimono-ACC three-year beforewear-PRES'Ken has the experience of wearing that kimonothree years ago.
'Notice that English translations use separate lex-ical items (put on for (a) and wear for (b), (c))and different aspectual configurations (the progres-sive for (a), the perfect progressive for (b), and an-other for (c)), while all Japanese sentences containthe same verbal form ki-te-i-ru.
Thus.
when the sys-tem tries to translate these sentences, it must beaware of the difference among them.This paper describes an approach to extract theaspectual information of Japanese verb phrases froma monolingual corpus.
In the next section, we willclassify Japanese verbs into six categories by meansof aspectual features following the framework of(Bennett et al, 1990).
The aspectual forms landadverbs are defined as the functions which operateon verbs' aspectual features and changes their val-ues.
By using the constraints of the applicability ofthe functions, we can identify a unique category foreach verb automatically.
If one can acquire aspec-tual properties of verbs properly and know how theother constituents in a sentence operate on them,then the aspectual meaning of the whole sentencewill be determined monotonically.
To evaluate theresult of the experiment, we will examine the mean-ing of -teiru which is one of the most fundamentalaspectual forms, since the classification itself is dif-ficult to evaluate objectively.2 Rea l i za t ion  P rocess  o f  Aspectua lMean ingWe consider that the whole aspectual meaning ofverb phrases is determined in the following order:verbs ---, arguments  ~ adverbs ~ aspectualforms, Adverbs and aspectual forms are definedas indicators of such cognitive processes as "zoom-ing" and "focusing" which operate on the time-linerepresentation.
They are sinfilar to the notions "as-pectual coercion" (Moens and Steedman, 1988) orI The term "form" refers to grammatical morphemeswhich axe defined in terms of derivation.
In this paper,we refer to the aspectual morphemes which follow verbsas "aspectual forms", including compound verbs such as.hazimevu(begin), suffixes with epenthetic -re such as -teiru, and aspectual nominals uch as -bakaviOust now)etc.352"views" (Gunji, 1992).
We explain each in turn.2.1 Aspectual Categories of VerbsA number of aspectually oriented lexical-semanticrepresentations have been proposed.
~Ve adoptand extend the feature-based framework proposedby (Bennett et al, 1990) in the spirit of (Moensand Steedman, 1988).
They uses three features:?dynamic, ?telic, and ?atomic.
We add two morefeatures: ?process and ?gradual.The feature dynamic i ty  distinguishes betweenstates(-d) and events(+d), and atomic i ty  dis-tinguishes between point events(+a) and extendedevents(-a).
The duration described by verbs istwofold: an ongoing process and a consequent s ate.The feature process concerns an ongoing processand distinguishes whether events described by verbshave the duration for which some actions unfold.The feature tel icity distinguishes between culmi-native events(+t) and nonculminative events(-t).It presupposes a process.
The feature gradual i tycharacterizes vents in which some kind of change isincluded and the change gradually develops.We can classify verbs by means of different com-binations of the five features.
Since there are depen-dences between features, only subsets of the com-binatorially possible configurations of features aredefined as shown in the Table 1.In the Table 1, 1.stative verbs are those thatare not dynamic.
2.atomic verbs are those thatexpress an atomic event.
3.resultative verbs ex-press a punctual event followed by a new state whichholds over some interval of time.
4 .process+resul tverbs are those that express a complex situationconsisting of a process which culminates in a newstate.
5.non-gradual  process verbs are thosethat express only processes and not changes of state.6.gradual  process verbs are those that have grad-uality.
Although the verbs of the categories 5 and6 don't contain telicity, the arguments of the verbsor some kinds of adverbs can set up the endpoint ofthe process as discussed later.
In Vendlerian classi-fication, states correspond to 1, achievements o 2and 3, accomplishments to 4 and 6, activities to 5,respectively (Vendler, 1957).Table 1: Aspectual categories of verbs2.2 ArgumentsTenny points out that internal argument of a verbcan be defined as that which temporally delimits ormeasures out the event (Tenny, 1994).The direct internal argument can aspectually?
'measure out the event" to which the verb refers.
Toclarify what is meant by "'mesuring-out", she givesexamples of three kinds of measuring-out: incremen-tal theme verbs (eat an apple, build a house etc.
),change-of-state v rbs (ripen the fruit etc.)
and pathobjects of route verbs (climbed the ladder, play asonata etc.
).On the other hand, the indirect internal argumentcan provide a temporal terminus for the event de-scribed by the verb.
The terminus causes the eventto be delimited as in push the car to a gas station.There is only one kind of internal argument, in termsof thematic roles, that does provide an event termi-nus, and that is a goal.In terms of the current framework, both of themadd the telicity to the verb which does not inherentlycontain the telicity.
They play a role of framing theinterval on which the focus should be brought.2.3 AdverbsIn general, adverbs focus on the subpart of the eventdescribed by a verb and give a more detailed de-scription.
According to the discussion in (Moriyama,1988), adverbs can be classified as follows in termsof the subpart on which they focus.Processes modifiers modify verbs which haveprocess (+p).
This class includes reduplicative ono-matopoeia such as gasagasa, batabata, suisui, ses-seto, butubutu, etc., which are expressing sound ormanner of directed motion, and rate adverbs uchas yukkuri(slowly), tebayaku(quickly), etc., which ex-press the speed of motions.
They focus on the on-going process of events described by verbs.Gradua l  change indicators express theprogress of change of state, such as dandan (grad-ually), sukosizutu (little by little), jojom (gradually),dondon (constantly).
sidaini (by degrees), etc.. whichmodify gradual process verbs (+g) and focus on theprocess.Cont inuous adverbs are those that can mod-ify both states verbs ( -d)  and process verbs (+p),such as zutto(for a long time), itumademo(forever),etc.
They express a continuance of an event or amaintenance of a state.categories features examples1.stative2.atomic3.resultative4.process+result5.non-gradual process6.gradual process\[-d\]\[+d,+a\]\ [+d, -a , -p\ ]\ [+d,-a,+p,+t\]\ [+d, -a ,+p, - t , -g \ ]\ [+d, -a ,+p, - t ,+g\]aru(be), sobieru(  se), sonzaisuru( e=isOhirameku(flash), mikakeru(notice)suwaru(sit down), tatu(stand up)korosu(kill), Urn(put on~wear), ake,' (open)aruku(walk), in(say), utau(sing)kusaru(turn sour), takamaru(become high)353Atomic  adverbs  make any events instantaneous,such as satto, ponto, gatatto, potarito, syunkan, etc.,which express instantaneous sound emission or aninstant.
When these adverbs co-occur with verbs,the events are understood as instantaneous.
Thisdoesn't  necessarily imply that the verb itself is in-stantaneous.Quant i ty  regu la tors  measure out events, suchas gokiro aruku(walk 5kin).
gojikan seizasita(sitstraight for 5 hours), etc.
These include time, dis-tance, and any quantity of contents.End  s ta te  mod i f ie rs  express the consequentstate of events, such as mapputatuni(into wo ex-act halves), konagonani(into pieces), pechankoni(befiat), barabarani(come apart), etc.
They focus onthe resultant state.So far we have described adverbs which concern asingle event, but some adverbs regulate the multipleevents which involves iteration of a single event.
Byiteration, the whole process of a collective vent canbe taken up regardless of the inherent features ofverbs.There are two kinds of Repetition adverbs:one regulates the whole quantity of the iterationof events such as san-kai(three times) or nan-domo(many times) etc., and the other describes thehabitual  repetit ion of events such as itumo(always)or syottyuu(very often) etc.
Both describe manyevents each of which involves one person's act.Finally, we shall mention T ime in the  past  ad -verbs .
There are cases where the form -teiru, whichmarks the present ense, can co-occur with tempo-ral adverbs describing the past.
(See the exan~ple( lc)  in the introduction.)
It describes the experien-tial fact of an event.
Such adverbs as katute(once),mukasi(in the past) and izen(be/ore) determine thetemporal  structure of the event related with tense.2.4 Aspectua l  FormsThe abi l i ty of aspectual forms to follow verbs is con-strained by the inherent features of verbs.
We brieflydescribe some of aspectual forms used in the exper-iment.The forms -you-to-suru(be going to) andkakeru(be about o) take up the occurrence of events.They can follow the verbs which are dynamic(+d) .The form -tuzukeru(continue)can follow the verbswhich have durat ion( -a ) .
It can take up either theongoing process or the resultant state.
The form -hajimeru(begin) can follow the verbs which have pro-cess(-bp) and takes up the start  time of the process.On the other hand, the forms -owaru(cease) and -oeru(finish) can follow the verbs which are te l ic(+t)and takes up the end point of the process.
However,these constraints on the inherent features of verbsare only concerned with a single event.
By itera-tion, the whole process of a collective event can betaken up regardless of the inherent features of verbs,as mentioned above.The forms -tutuaru(be in progress), -tekuru(comeinto state) and -teiku(go into state) focus on thegradual process of change.
-Tutuaru(be in progress)takes up it as a kind of state, -tekuru(come intostate) views it from the end state of change while-teiku(go into state) from the initial state of change.Both of -tekuru and -teiku have usages other thanaspect, as in mot-tekuru(bring) or mot-teiku(take).3 ExperimentWe carried out an experiment to classify Japaneseverbs into six categories in the Table 1 by means ofcorpus data.As shown in the Figure 1, each category is definedin terms of the abil ity to co-occur with aspectualforms.
However, the discrimination of the categoriesneeds negative vidence which we cannot use by def-inition.
A corpus only provides positive evidence.Furthermore, some forms can be used regardless ofthe features and have usages other than aspect asdiscussed in the previous ection.

The corpus contains 220,000 sentences fromvarious genres of text.
The results of the parsinganalysis of these sentences indicates that the con-stituents of the sentence have a dependency struc-354STEP: I  Pick out the items of which the governing anddependent words are a verb and an adverb fromthe EDR Co-occurrence Dictionary and store themwith the frequency in an array called PAIRS (cf.Table 2).STEP:2  For each adverb in PAIRS, give an adverb classlabel (the initial letter of the class name) on the ba-sis of the discussion i  sec.
2.3 and store them in anarray called ADVERBS (cf.
Table3 and Table4).STEP:3  For each verb in PAIRS, add up the frequencyof the co-occurrence with the adverbs contained inthe array ADVERBS.
If the sum is greater than 4,store the verb in a list called VERBS.STEP:4 For each sentence in the corpus, find a verband if it is contained in VERBS, then:STEP:4?
I  If the form following the verb is con-tained in the predefined list (Table5), makean array FORMS\[/,j\] positive (where i is theposition of the verb in the list VERBS and jis the position of the form in the Table 5, seeTable6), provided that the verb is not modi-fied by repetition adverbs(R).
When the formis -tekuru or -teiku, put it on record only ifthe verb is modified by gradual change indica-tors(G).STEP:4-2 If the verb is modified by the adverbscontained in the array ADVERBS, refer tothe adverb class label and add 1 to an arrayMODIFIED\[i, k\] (where i is the position of theverb in the list VERBS and k is the position ofthe adverb class label in the Table4.
When theadverb is continuous one(C), distinguish thecases where the verb is followed by -teiru(C1)from the other eases(C2), see Table7), pro-vided that the verb is not followed by negativeforms such as -nai or -zu, nor the forms whichchange the voice such as -reru(the passivizer)or -seru(the causativizer), since they affect theaspeetual properties of the attached verb.STEP:5 For each verb in VERBS:STEP:5-1 Narrow down the candidates by meansof the array FORMS (on the basis of possiblecategories shown in Table 5).STEP:5-2 In the ease where the category of theverb cannot be uniquely identified in STEP:5-1, i.e., other than the category 6, determine itby means of the array MODIFIED as follows:the category 6the category 5the category 4the category 3the category 2the category 1ambiguousture.
That is.
the constituents have a governing-dependent relation.
It is these constituents thatform the head phrases of the Japanese Co-occurrenceDictionary which describes collocational informationin the form of binary relations.
Each item in theJapanese Co-occurrence Dictionary consists of a gov-erning word.
a dependent word, the relator betweenthe words, and supplementary co-occurrence iteminformation which is composed of the frequency ofthe co-occurrence r lation and a portion of the ac-tual example sentence from which the co-occurrencerelation was taken.The algorithm used for classifying verbs is shownin Figure 2.Table 2: A part of the array PAIRSI "d~b I verb I r~q ?

There are 431 verbs modifiedby the classified adverbs more than 4 times.
In step2, we classify adverbs on the basis of the discussionin the previous ection.
Although the classificationhas been done by hand, it is much easier than thatof verbs, since adverbs are fewer than verbs in num-ber (2,563 vs. 12,766 in the corpus) and have higher"iconicity" - -  the isomorphism between form andmeaning - -  than verbs.
This classification of ad-verbs is used not only for determining the aspectualcategories of verbs but also for examining the mean-ing of - te i ru as mentioned later.The step 4 is a process to register the co-occurringforms and adverbs for each verb.
By using thesedata, we identify the aspectual categories of verbs inthe step 5.
Since the categories cannot be uniquelyidentified by aspectual forms only, we use adverbswhich can modify the only restricted set of verbs asshown in Table 8.Table 8:categoriesadverb cl ass (Ta-b'e--i~Adverb classes and their modifiable verbverb cate~process modifiers (P)gradual change indicators (G)continuous adverbs (C)atomic adverbs (A)quantity regulators (Q)end state modifiers (E)4 ,5 ,661,3 ,4 ,5 ,62 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,61 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,63, 4, 63.2  Eva luat ion  and Discuss ionOut of 431 target verbs, we could uniquely identifycategories for 375 verbs.
As for the rest 56 verbs, 37verbs were identified in the step 5-2 as the categorywhich was not included in the set of categories out-putted by the step 5-1.
This seems to be due to thefailure to detect the expression of repetition, there-fore, we chose the category determined in the step5-2.
Table 9 shows the results.We confirmed that more than 80% of verbs arecorrectly classified.
However, this is a subjectivejudgement.
To evaluate the results of the classifi-cation more objectively, we focus on one evaluationmetric; namely the automatic examination of themeaning of - te iru which can represent several dis-tinct senses as described in the introduction.The form - te iru indicates "zoom in" operation: itis a function that takes an event as its input andreturns a type of states, which refers to unboundedregions i.e., a part of the time-line with no distinctboundaries.
Figure 3 shows the time-line representa-tion for each aspectual category of verbs.
Aspectualdistinctions correspond to how parts of the time-lineare delineated.1.

The interval(1) in Figure3 designates a state which is a partof the state described by a lex_ical stative verb.
Itmeans a state holding before a speaker's eyes.It has been stated from (Kindaichi, 1976) that theform -teiru has three distinct senses: "a simple state','a progressive state' and 'a consequent state'.
(1)corresponds to a simple state.
(4) and (7) to a con-sequent state, (6), (9) and (11) to a progressive state.respectively.
Though not represented in Figure 3, aconsequent s ate can be taken up with the verbs ofcategories 5 and 6 if the endpoints of the processesare set up by explicit expressions.Kudo (Kudo, 1982) has pointed out that there areinherent meaning and derivative meaning for bothprogressive and consequent s ates and has sorted outthem as follows.
(i) inherent meaning of 'a progressive state': anongoing process(ii) derivative meaning of 'a progressive state': aniteration(iii) inherent meaning of 'a consequent s ate': a re-sultative state(iv) derivative meaning of 'a consequent state': anexperiential state(v) otherwise: a simple state(ii) is the above-mentioned process of a collectiveevent; "a line as a set of points", so to speak.
(iv)is a state where a speaker has an experience of theevent described by a verb and corresponds to theintervals (2), (3), (5), (8), (10), (12) in Figure3.These derivative meanings are conditioned syntacti-cally or contextually, that is, they are stipulated asderivative by explicit linguistic expressions such asadverbials etc., while not concerned with the inher-ent features of verbs - -  they can appear with mostof verbs regardless of their aspectual categories.We carried out an experiment o examine themeaning of -teiru automatically by means of the clas-sifications of verbs and adverbs obtained in the pre-vious experiment.
Table 10 shows the determinationprocess of the meaning of -teiru.
We checked thecases in Table 10 downward from the top.Table 11 shows the results obtained from runningthe process of Table 10 on 200 sentences containing-teiru which are randomly selected from the EDRJapanese Corpus.The precision on the whole is 71%.
Note thatthe sense (i) 'an ongoing process' has high recall butlow precision, while (iii) 'a resultative state' and (iv)'an experiential state' show the opposite.
This isdue to the fact that the test sentences contain many"speech-act" verbs such as syuchousuru(insist), se-tumeisuru(explain), hyoumeisuru( declare) etc.
Theyare classified as 5.non-gradual process verbs, and byTable 10: The determination process of the meaningof -teirucase  output(1).the verb is modified by repetition (ii) an iterationadverbs( R}(2).the verb is modified by time inthe past adverbs(P) or its categoryis 2. atomic verbs(3).the category of the verb is1.

Therefore the resulta-tive or experiential readings are preferred.The other errors are caused by polysemousverbs such as kakaru (hangflie//all...) or ataru(hit/strike~be xposed/shine...).
Their aspectualproperties are changed by the complements theytake.
The analysis of how complements influencethe aspectual properties of their governing verbs isbeyond the scope of this paper.
It seems to be a mat-ter of pragmatic world knowledge rather than sense-semantics (but see (Verkuyl, 1993) for English).4 Re la ted  WorkThe approach proposed here is similar to that ofDorr's (Dorr, 1992: Dorr.
1993), but different fromit in scale and determinability of the categories.
Sheadopts the four-way classification system followingVendler (Vendler, 1957) and utilizes Dowty's test(Dowty, 1991) for deternfining aspectual categoriesof English verbs.
She reports the results obtainedfrom running the program on 219 sentences of theLOB corpus.
Although we cannot know how manyverbs she tested because she has shown only a subsetof the verbs, the program was not able to pare downthe aspectual category to one in 18 cases out of 27verbs.Brent (Brent, 1991) discusses an implementedprogram that automatically classifies verbs into twogroups, stative vs. non-stative, on the basis of theirsyntactic ontexts.
He uses the progressive and rate-358Table 11: The restdts of the evaluation ex)erimentthe sense of-te=rujudgementby human(a)output ofprogram(b)number ofagreements(c)recall(%)c/a x 100precision(%)c/b x 100(i) an ongoing process 95 137 88 93 64(ii) an iteration 4 2 2 50 100(iii) a resultative state(iv) an experiential state(v) a simple state29 48 9339 15 14 36 9319 19 15 79 79ambiguous 14 12 9 64 75total 200 200 142 71 71adverbs constructions in combination with some sortof statistical smoothing technique.
He identifiedeleven verbs as purely stative, of the 204 distinctverbs occurring at least 100 times in the LOB cor-pus.We think that the extraction of aspectual infor-mation must be based on principles that are well-grounded in linguistic theory.
However, some sortof noise reduction technique such as the confidenceintervals used by Brent may be needed to detect hecue more accurately.5 Conc lus ionIn this paper, we have proposed a method for classi-fying Japanese verbs on the basis of surface videncefrom a monolingual corpus, and examined the mean-ing of the form -teiru by means of the classificationsof verbs and adverbs.The aspect of verb phrases provides not only thetemporal configuration within a single event but alsothe information eeded for processing temporal re-lation between multiple events (Dowty, 1986; Pas-sonneau, 1988; Webber, 1988).Furthermore, the lexical aspect of verbs is closelyrelated with their deep complement s ructures whichmay not be directly reflected on the surface argu-ment structures.
Therefore, by combining the aspec-tual categories of verbs and those that are defined interms of their surface argument structures, we canobtain an elaborate classification based on seman-tic types of verbs.
(Preliminary experiments on thisissue can be seen in (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1996).
