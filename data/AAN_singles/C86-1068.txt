A COMPRESSION TECHNIQI~ FOR ARABIC DICTIONARIES :THE AFFIX ANALYSIS.Abdelmajid BEN HAMADOUD~partement of computer science -FSEG FacultyB.P 69 - Route de l'a~roport -SFAX - TUNISIAABSTRACTIn every application that concerns the automaticprocessing of natural language, the problem of thedictionary size is posed.
In this paper , we propose acompression dictionary al~orithm based on an affix ana-lysis of the non diacritical Arabic.It consists in decomposing a word into its firstelements taking into account the different linguistictransformations that can affect the morphologicalstructures.This work has been achieved as part of a study ofthe automatic detection and correction of spelling errorsin the non diacritical Arabic texts.I- INTRODUCTIONIn every application that concerns the automaticprocessing of natural language, the problem of thedictionary size is posed.
We can approach this impor-tant question in several ways and particularly :- By grouping together the common prefixes of thedifferent language words.
In the PIAF system,(interac-tive program for French Analysis) for instance, wordsare represented in chained lists following an alpha-betical order \[COUR 77\]EX : PARTIEL ~ PARTIES_____--~_PARTOUT ...PARTIE-~ JPART - , ~ - -- By creating multiple dictionaries: or:efor eachmajor topic area.
This approach requires, in addition,a common base dictionary.
When a particular area isconcerned, a temporary master dictionary is createdby increasinF the base dictionary with selected localones.-- By usin~ the Affix analysis which consists inperforming a morphological analysis in order to iden-tify, in a given word, the redundant elements(Affixes).
The dictionary will be limited to the non-redundant elements (roots).
This technique is usedspecially in the DECIO - SPELL system for detectingand correcting spelling errors.In the present paper, we will develop this lastapproach for the non_diacritical Arabic.The particularities of the algorithms that wepropose, stem~ in great part, form the specificitiesof the language used :- Words are written in consonantic form- Words can contain infixes- Morphological structures can be altered bylinguistic transformations.This work has been developed within a nationalresearch project for the study of the automatic detec-tion and correction of spelling errors in Arabic textsBEN 86 7II - THEORETICAL ASPECTSLet V be a finite Setand V ~, the set of words built on V includingnul s$ing notedW ~-V-- W = W I W 2 ......

Morphological decompositionThe Affix analysis consists in decomposing agiven word into its first elements among which we candistinguish the affixes (prefix, infix and suffix)which are the redundant elements of the language andthe root which is its non redundant one .286This decomposition is based on the derivationalstructure of the \]anguage : nearly all the words areobtained by adding an affix combination to a givenroot.suffix Infix Root  Prefixes- Root  = ~ ka~aba- Prefix = ~- Infix = ~ tO- Suffix = "&-- ?Among the possible affix comb{nations, we dis-tinguish those that are valid and those that are not.Valid combinations constitute what is called Morpho-\]ogical Pattern (M P)For a given word, the number of possible morpho-logical decnmpositim~s depends on the root, accordingto whether or not it contains characters which can beassimilated to different affixes.Th is  nui~)er i s  ca lcu la ted  using the followingformula :Nd = Card ( b~i  ~ .

Study of the morphological transformationsThe morphological derivation for a root can beaccompanied with transformations caused by linguisticohenomena such as asshnilation, contraction,metathisJs.These transformations can affect the Root aswell as the affixes (M P).
The Roots affected aremainly those which contain the charactersyaa :  q , Waw : ~ and hamza :EX 1 : Root affected.Consider the root : .uy--~Derivation"v----~ ~"  .

t -~The morphological transformations can be classifiedinto two categories :- The morpho-phonological transformation arethose that substitute a character for another onewithout changing the length of the word (isometrica\]transformations)-(see EX1 and EX2).- The purely phonological transformations arethose that suppress one or more characters, thereforethey modify the length of the word.EX 3 : consider the root ~-_ii~Derivation transformationwaqafa yawqi~u yaqifuEX 4 : considc_r the root ~Der ~ vat ion tran~ format iond__C~( ,?

To remove theseambiguities, we use heuristics among which we canmention for instance :Let D be the morphological derivatio~ operatorsuch as : D ( R , P , I , S ) = W W ~ Vand T the operator composed of a derivation followedby a transformation.
And D the morE~olOglcal dec6mpo-sit,on operator (inverse of D) and T the morphologi-cal decomposition operator taking into account thetransformational rules (inverse of T).Consider W the word to be ana\]ysed.If_ D (W) = (R l ' Pl i f l '  SI)'RI G V+and P I , I I ,S ICV~anji (W) = (R2,P2,I2,S2) , R2?V + and P2,12,$2 e V xSo R 1 is the selected root (R 2 is rejected)F,X :~a?a2ta .\[, ?The root retained is : J - - - -~ '~ da.

The morphological decomposition modulepermits to--~.de'{~Ty the different ~-ombinat ions .It is executed in two steps :Step one : IdentiJieation of prefixes and suf-fixes by us~- -a  table o~ prefixes and a table ofsuffixes.Step two : identification of the infix byanaysing-t~Te remaining chain after eliminating P andS.The analyser has s single initia\] state andas many ways as there are infix possibilities.The interest of realising this decompositioninto two steps lies in the use of a single analyserin order to rec.

Validation moduleThe two precedin~ steps lead to a list ofcandidate decompositions.\]it is necessary to apply tothis list an adequate validation mechanism to sortout the valid decompositionThis fi\]terin~ can provide multiple solutions.In these conditions, we talk about morphological ambi-guity that can not be removed without considering thecontext: of the word in the sentence.However, the affix analysis used for the pur-pose of verifying whether or not a word belongs tothe language can be content with the first validdecomposition.287= W I W2''  W nRoot ; RAffixes (P,l,~)ANAL?SERJ-- Prefixes CONGRUITYSuffixes MATRIX- Lis~ o?~rllho loKicalCodes.

.Fi~ \[ : Functional Affix Analysis diagramThe validation is based on the principle of affi~congruity and on the result of the root dictionarychecking.The affix congruity arises at three differentlevels : - Compatibility between the prefix (P) andthe suffix (S)-Compat ib i l i ty  between the couple (P,q) :~n~the infix (I).- Compatibility between the MorphologicalPattern (P,I,S) and the Root (R) .The compatibility between P andS is obtained fromthe affix congruity matrix C (P. ,S.) composed of 609e~ements (2| prefixes and 29 su~fi~es).

This technique hasproved efficient for Arabic because of its derivationalstructure.
We have tested this technique on a corpusmade up of \]O0,000 words or so using the dictionaryof the 1,600 roots.The programs are written in FORTRAN for reasonsof portability, easy calculation of the Dictionaryaccess argument and index manipulation.Used in the context of the detection and correc-tion of spelling errors, the affix analysis is interes-ting in "that :in memoryiI$ makes easier the use of the dictionary lomded- performs a natural cutting of the words,which facilitates the algorithms of automatic correc-ting based on inferential mechanisms and heuristicsThese features ~ive the suggested algorithms someoriginality and a contribution tb the work Jn thefield of Arabic morphological analysis.BIBLIOGRAPHY(BEN ~6) - A.
