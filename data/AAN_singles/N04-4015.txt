Morphological Analysis for Statistical Machine TranslationYoung-Suk LeeIBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598Email: ysuklee@us.ibm.comAbstractWe present a novel morphologicalanalysis technique which induces amorphological and syntactic   symmetrybetween two languages with highlyasymmetrical morphological structures toimprove statistical machine translationqualities.
The technique pre-supposesfine-grained segmentation of a word inthe morphologically rich language intothe sequence of prefix(es)-stem-suffix(es)and  part-of-speech tagging of the parallelcorpus.
The algorithm identifiesmorphemes to be merged or deleted in themorphologically rich language to inducethe desired morphological and syntacticsymmetry.
The technique improvesArabic-to-English translation qualitiessignificantly  when applied to IBM Model1 and Phrase Translation Models trainedon the training corpus size ranging from3,500 to 3.3 million sentence pairs.1.
IntroductionTranslation of two languages with  highlydifferent morphological structures as exemplifiedby Arabic and English poses a challenge tosuccessful implementation of statistical machinetranslation models (Brown et al 1993).
Rarelyoccurring inflected forms of a stem in Arabicoften do not accurately translate due to thefrequency imbalance with the correspondingtranslation word in English.
So called a word(separated by a white space) in Arabic oftencorresponds to more than one independent wordin English, posing a technical problem to thesource channel models.
In the English-Arabicsentence alignment shown in Figure 1, Arabicword AlAHmr (written in Buckwaltertransliteration) is aligned to two English words?the red?, and llmEArDp to three English words?of the opposition.?
In this paper, we present atechnique to induce a morphological andsyntactic symmetry between two languages withdifferent morphological structures for statisticaltranslation quality improvement.The technique is implemented as a two-stepmorphological processing for word-basedtranslation models.
We first apply wordsegmentation to Arabic, segmenting a word intoprefix(es)-stem-suffix(es).
Arabic-Englishsentence alignment after Arabic wordsegmentation is illustrated in Figure 2, where oneArabic morpheme is aligned to one or zeroEnglish word.
We then apply the proposedtechnique to the word segmented  Arabic corpusto identify prefixes/suffixes to be merged intotheir stems or deleted to induce a symmetricalmorphological structure.
Arabic-Englishsentence alignment after Arabic morphologicalanalysis is shown in Figure 3, where the suffix pis merged into their stems mwAjh and mEArd.For phrase translation models, we applyadditional morphological analysis induced fromnoun phrase parsing of Arabic to accomplish asyntactic as well as morphological symmetrybetween the two languages.2.
Word SegmentationWe pre-suppose segmentation of a word intoprefix(es)-stem-suffix(es), as described in (Lee etal.
2003)  The category prefix and suffixencompasses function words such as conjunctionmarkers, prepositions, pronouns, determiners andall inflectional morphemes of the language.
If aword token contains more than one prefix and/orsuffix, we posit multiple prefixes/suffixes perstem.
A sample word segmented Arabic text isgiven below, where prefixes are marked with #,and suffixes with +.w# s# y# Hl sA}q Al# tjArb fy jAgwAr Al#brAzyly lwsyAnw bwrty mkAn AyrfAyn fy Al#sbAq gdA Al# AHd Al*y s# y# kwn Awly xTw+At +h fy EAlm sbAq +At AlfwrmwlA3.
Morphological  AnalysisMorphological analysis identifies functionalmorphemes to be merged into meaning-bearingstems or to be deleted.
In Arabic, functionalmorphemes typically belong to prefixes orsuffixes.Sudan  :    alert    in       the     red     sea   to  face       build-up    of      the  oppositions       in     EritreaAlswdAn         :    AstnfAr    fy  AlbHr  AlAHmr   lmwAjhp    H$wd   llmEArDp     dAxl      ArytryAFigure 1.

girl vs. girls.3.1 MethodWe apply part-speech tagging to a symboltokenized and word segmented Arabic andsymbol-tokenized English parallel corpus.
Wethen viterbi-align the part-of-speech taggedparallel corpus, using translation parametersobtained via Model 1 training of wordsegmented Arabic and symbol-tokenized English,to derive the conditional probability of anEnglish part-of-speech tag given the combinationof an Arabic prefix and its part-of-speech or anArabic suffix and its part-of-speech.11 We have used an Arabic part-of-speech tagger witharound 120 tags, and an English part-of-speech taggerwith around 55 tags.3.2  AlgorithmThe algorithm utilizes two sets of translationprobabilities to determine merge/deletionanalysis of a morpheme.
We obtain tag-to-tagtranslation probabilities according to (1), whichidentifies the most probable part-of-speechcorrespondences between Arabic (tagA) andEnglish (tagE).
(1) Pr(tagE | tagA)We also obtain translation probabilities of anEnglish part-of-speech tag given each Arabicprefix/suffix and its part-of-speech according to(2) and (3):(2)  Pr(tagE | stemtagA, suffixj_tagjk)(2) computes the translation probability of anArabic suffix and its part-of-speech into anEnglish part-of-speech in the Arabic stem tagcontext, stemtagA.
StemtagA is one of the majorstem parts-of-speech with which the specifiedprefix or suffix co-occurs, i.e.
ADV, ADJ, NOUN,NOUN_PROP, VERB_IMPERFECT, VERB_PERFECT.
2J in suffixj ranges from 1 to M, M = number ofdistinct suffixes co-occurring with stemtagA.tagjk in suffixj_tagjk is the part-of-speech of suffixj,where k ranges from 1 to L, L = number of2  All Arabic part-of-speech tags are adopted fromLDC-distributed Arabic Treebank and English tags areadopted from Penn Treebank.distinct tags assigned to the suffixj in the trainingcorpus.
(3) Pr(tagE | prefixi_tagik, stemtagA)(3) computes the translation probability of anArabic prefix and its part-of-speech into anEnglish part-of-speech in the Arabic stem tagcontext, stemtagA.
Prefixi and tagik inprefixi_tagik may be interpreted in a manneranalogous to suffixj and tagjk of suffixj_tagjk in (2).3.2.1  IBM Model 1The algorithm for  word-based translation model,e.g.
IBM Model 1, implements the idea that if amorpheme in one language is robustly  translatedinto a distinct part-of-speech in the otherlanguage, the morpheme is very likely to have itsindependent counterpart in the other language.Therefore, a robust overlap of tagE given tagAbetween Pr(tagE|tagA) and Pr(tagE|stemtagA,suffixj_tagjk) for a suffix  and Pr(tagE|tagA) andPr(tagE|prefixi_tagik, stemtagA) for a prefix is apositive indicator that the Arabic prefix/suffixhas an independent counterpart in English.
If theoverlap is weak or doesn?t exist, the prefix/suffixis unlikely to have an independent counterpartand is subject to merge/deletion analysis.3Step 1: For each tagA, select the top 3 mostprobable tagE from Pr(tagE|tagA).Step 2: Partition all prefixi_tagik and suffixj_tagjkinto two groups in each  stemtagA context.Group I: At least one of  ?tagE|tagik?
or?tagE|tagjk?
occurs as one of the top 3 mostprobable translation pairs in Pr(tagE|tagA).Prefixes and suffixes in this group are likely tohave their independent counterparts in English.Group II: None of  ?tagE|tagik?
or ?tagE|tagjk?occurs as one of the top 3 most probabletranslation pairs in Pr(tagE|tagA).
Prefixes andsuffixes in this group are unlikely to have theirindependent counterparts in English.Step 3:  Determine the merge/deletion analysisof  the prefixes/suffixes in Group II as follows: Ifprefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk occurs in more than onestemtagA context, and its translation probabilityinto NULL tag is the highest, delete theprefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk in the stemtagA context.If prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk occurs in more thanone stemtagA context, and its translation3  We assume that only one tag is assigned to onemorpheme or word, i.e.
no combination tag of theform DET+NOUN, etc.probability into NULL tag is not the highest,merge the prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk into its stemin the  stemtagA context.Merge/deletion analysis is applied to allprefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk occurring in theappropriate stem tag contexts in the trainingcorpus (for translation model training) and a newinput text (for decoding).3.2.2 Phrase Translation ModelFor phrase translation models (Och and Ney2002),  we induce  additional merge/deletionanalysis on the basis of base noun phrase parsingof Arabic.
One major  asymmetry betweenArabic and English is caused by more frequentuse of the determiner Al# in Arabic comparedwith its counterpart the in English.
We applyAl#-deletion to Arabic noun phrases so that onlythe first occurrence of Al#  in a noun phrase isretained.
All instances of Al# occurring before aproper noun ?
as in Al# qds, whose literaltranslation is the Jerusalem ?
are also deleted.Unlike the automatic induction of morphologicalanalysis described in 3.2.1,  Al#-deletion analysisis manually induced.4.
Performance EvaluationsSystem performances are evaluated on LDC-distributed Multiple Translation Arabic Part Iconsisting of 1,043 segments derived from AFPand Xinhua newswires.
Translation qualities aremeasured by uncased BLEU (Papineni et al2002) with 4 reference translations, sysids: ahb,ahc, ahd, ahe.Systems are developed from 4 different sizesof training corpora, 3.5K, 35K, 350K and 3.3Msentence pairs, as in Table 1.
The number in eachcell indicates the number of sentence pairs ineach genre (newswires, ummah, UN corpus).4Genre    3.5K    35K    350K     3.3MNews   1,000   1,000     9,238      12,002Ummah      500   1,000   13,027      13,027UN   2,000 33,000 327,735 3,270,200Table 1.

Impact of morphological analysis onPhrase Translation ModelBLEU scores under baseline and morphanalysis are obtained in a manner analogous toModel 1 except that the morphological analysisfor the phrase translation model is a combinationof the automatically induced analysis for Model1 plus the manually induced Al#-deletion in 3.2.2.The scores with only automatically inducedmorphological analysis are 0.21, 0.25, 0.33 and0.36 for 3.5K, 35K, 350K and 3.3M sentencepair training corpora, respectively.5.
Related  WorkAutomatic induction of the desired linguisticknowledge from a word/morpheme-alignedparallel corpus is analogous to (Yarowsky et al2001).
Word segmentation and merge/deletionanalysis in morphology is similar to parsing andinsertion operation in syntax by (Yamada andKnight 2001).
Symmetrization of linguisticstructures can also be found in (Niessen and Ney2000).5  Our experiments indicate that addition of Al#-deletion, cf.
Phrase Translation Model, does not affectthe performance of IBM Model 1.AcknowledgementsThis work was partially supported by theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agencyand monitored by SPAWAR under contract No.N66001-99-2-8916.
