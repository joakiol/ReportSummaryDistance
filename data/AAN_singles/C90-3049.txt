LibermanAT&T Bell Laboratories600 Mountain AvenueMurray tlill, NJ 07974Abst ractA finite transducer that processes Spanish inflec-tional amt derivational morphology is presented.The system handles both generation astd analysisof tens of millions inflected ibrms.
Lexical andsurface (orthographic) representations of the wordsare linked by a program that interprets a finite di-rected graph whose arcs are labelled by n-tuples ofstrings.
Each of about 55,000 base forms requires atle~t one arc in the graph.
Representing the inflec-tional and derivational possibilities for these formsimposed an overhead of only about 3000 additionalarcs, of which about 2500 represent (phonologically-predictable) stem allomorphy, so that we pay a stor-age price of about 5% for compiling these form~ off-line.
A simple interpreter for the resulting automa-ton processes several hundred words per second on aSun4.it In t roduct ionOne useful way to look at computational morphologyand phonology is in terms of transductlons,  that is,n-sty word relations definable by the element-wiseconcatenation of n-tuple labels along paths in a fi-idte directed labeled graph.
For instance, we cantake one member of such a relation to be the spellingof an inflected form, another member to be the corre-t~ponding lemma, another to be a string representingi ts  morphosyntactic features, another to represent i spronunciation, and so forth.Inspired by the (unpublished) work of Kaplan andKay (ongoing since the late 1970's), and that ofKoskenniemi in \[12\], many researchers have used bi-nary word relations to represent "underlying" and"surface" forms in the morphophonology of words.Much of the interest of this work has been focusedon methods to combine multiple two-tape automata,which may be composed or run in parallel in orderto compute the desired binary relation.In this paper, we take a somewhat different ap-proach to defining and computing word relations,and discuss its application in a morphological proces-sot for Spanish orthographic words that covers morethan forty millions forms generable from the approxi-mately 55,000 basic words in the Collins Spanish Dic-tionary (\[3\]) 1.
The main advantage of this approachis the extreme simplicity both of its data structuresand of their interpretation.
As a result, an inter-preter is easy to implement; time and/or space op-=timization issues in the implementation are straight..forward to define; at the same time, it is extremelyeasy to compile traditional morphological informa-tion into the required form, at least for languages likeSpanish that can be fairly well modeled in terms ofthe concatenation ofsteins and affixes.
As is usl~.llythe case in automata-based approaches, the systemtreats analysis and generation symmetrically, andtile same description can be run with equal facilityin either direction.Define 2 an n-ary nondeterminisi ic finite automa-ton as a 5-tupleA = (Q ,qt ,F ,E ,H)where Q is a finite non-empty set of states, ql is adesignated start state, F is a set of designated finalstates, E is a finite non-empty alphabet, and H isa finite subset of {Q ?
(E*)" ?
Q}, where (:E*) n isthe set of n-tuples of (possibly empty) words overE..,4 can be thought of as a labeled directed graph,whose nodes are elements of Q, and whose edges areelements of H, each such edge being labeled with theappropriate n-tuple of words.
The component-wiseconcatenation of labels along every path that beginsin ql and ends in an element of F defines a set ofn-tuples, R C (E*) n, which is the relation acceptedby A.As a practical matter, we generally want to run aprogram that (explicitly or implicitly) searches thisgraph in order to find all the n-tuples in R withsome interesting property, say those corresponding1 The present set can be increased almost exponentially byadding new derivatlonal ffixes.~The name and the basic idea of these automata come from\[5\].
For simplicity of exposition we gloss over various authors'attempts to distinguish variously among machines, automataand transducer#, aswell as the profusion of precursors mad de-scendants in (\[15\], [16\], [2\], \[7\], etc.).
Our notation is edeetlc.1 277to forms whose surface spelling is the string w, orthose corresponding to the first person plural imper-fect subjunctive of such-and-such a verb.
Dependingon the structure of H and the property selected, thesearch will be harder or easier.
For the stem-and-affix kind of morphology exemplified by Spanish, thenatural structure for H is quite easy to search.
Wedo not have space to discuss search methods here,but will simply observe that a non-optimal methoddevised for convenience in another experiment (\[6\])processes everal hundred Spanish words per secondon a Sun4.For the application discussed in this paper, wewant to relate inflected forms, lemmas, and mor-phosyntactic features, so that the elements of Rshould be 3-tuples like:( eambiaran, eambiar, 3rd plural per fect subjunctive).Since most Spanish words consist of a stem, whichmainly specifies the lemma, and a set of affixes thatmainly specify the morphosyntactic features, it is ap-propriate to use 2-tuples made by concatenating thesecond and third elements.The basis of our run-time system is the arc list H.For a large lexicon, it is inconvenient towrite this listby hand, and so we compile it from a lexical tablethat reflects more directly the way that morpholog-ical information is represented in a standard ictio-nary, such as the Collins dictionary we began with.The program interprets recursively all the possiblearcs of the lists.
Therefore, more than one analyzedor generated form is given.
For instance, the analysisfor the input word "retirada" is of the form:retiral" pas~ participle feminine singularretirado adjective feminine singularretirada noun feminine singular2 The arc-l ist compi lerThe arc-list compiler starts with a list of lexicalitems with their morphological classes, applying mor-phophonological transformations to generate the arclist.
For instance, each verb headword in the Collinsdictionary is given an index that specifies one of62 conjugation classes.
Based on this information,the arc-list compiler calculates the set of stem al-lomorphs necessary for that verb's inflection, alongwith the set of endings that each stem allomorphselects.
Spanish verbs have from one to five ortho-graphic stem allomorphs.
When the verb is regu-lar there is only one stem, like "cambi-" in "cam-biar" (to change).
An irregular verb may have upto five stems, like "ten-", "teng-", "tien-", "tend-", "tnv-" for the verb "tener" (to have).
This iscommon in Romance languages (see Tzoukermann1986 for French).
These different stems are the re-sult of morphophonological hanges occuring duringthe verbal flexion, usually related to the stress im-plications of the verbal ending or to the features ofits initial vowel.Depending on the conjugation class, the characterstring corresponding to the verb lemma is subjectedto one or more rewriting rules.
These rewriting rulesare of different ypes:* they can be the consequence of a stress changeduring the verbal flexion:(a) e -- ie when the last syllable is not stressedlike in quoter / qulero.
* they can be a morphographic change that is gen-eral to Spanish orthography:(b) c - qu before "e" and "i" like in sacar /saque.or the reverse rule(c) qu - c before "a", "o", "u" like in delinquir/ delinco.Some verbs are subject to one type of rewritingrule such as in (a) - (c) above, and consequentlyproduce one additional stein allomorph.
The verb"sacar" (to take / pull out) will generate "sac-"and "saqu-", as well as "delinqnir" (to offend) with"delinqu-" and "delinc-".Some other verbs, less frequent in number' butmore frequent in actual use, are subject to tworewriting rules and need a more complex treatment.In "forzar" (to force), tile morphophonological ru ecombines with the othographic one and produces adistribution of four steins, such as "forz-", "fore-", "fuerc-', "fuerz-".
The same phenomenon oc-curs for "rogar" (to beg) with the stems "rog-","rogu-", "rues-", "ruegu-".
For some verbs of thesecond group in "-er", the stem production is lesspredictable; for instance "tenet" presents five sterns"ten-", "teng-", "tien-", "tend-", "tuv-'.
Notice thatsome of them such as "tens-" do not follow the typeof morphophonological rules mentioned above.Because of Spanish orthographic conventions con-nected with the notation of stress, some nouns andadjectives also acquire more than one stein allomorphin a rule-governed way.
In addition, of course, theremust be a list of cases where the allomorphy is simplyunique to the word in question.3 The arc listUsing a state labeled 1 by convention as the startstate, and a state labeled 0 by convention as the(unique) final state, we express all of the informa-tion needed to define our automaton .4 by enumer-ating the arcs in H, which now can be representedas lists of 4-tuples (qi,qj,u,v), where qi and qj arearbitrary identifiers for states, u is a substring of aninflected form, and v is a substring of the correspond-ing lemma + morphosyntactic category.278  2{Jsed either tbr analysis or for generation, our pro-.gram interprets this same arc list.
The arc list canbe conceptually divided in two parts: one containsthe stems of the verbs, nouns and adjectives; theother contains a number of sub-lexicons that providethe endings for these lexical categories as well as theclitics?Our Spanish system is defined by a set of about58,000 such 4-tuples, (most of which are) gener~ated by rule from head words and category informa-tion extracted from the typographer's tape for theCollin:~ Spanish Dictionary.
Affixes, assorted null-string transitions and tittles account for about 1000elements of this set; the remainder are stems or stemallomorphs.
Since we have about 55,000 laminas, theoverhead for compiling out predictable aspects of al-lomorphy is at worst the approximately 2,500 stemallolnorphs and affix arcs, i.e.
less than 5%.
Thereare about 225 states in total.3.1.
:Verbal stemsThe verbal stem lexicon was obtained by extractingtile verb headwords (about 6,800 Spanish verbs) fromthe Collins dictionary.Once the grammar provides the stems, a state pairis associated to them.
The first state is always theinitial state "1", the second depemts on the type ofstern and its ending throughout the conjugation (dig-its or character strings can be used indifferently forlabelling the states), l~br example, for the first verbconjugation, whose infinitives end in "-at," the sec-ond states are spread out among 10 different states.I 2 cambi carabiari 6 cruc cruzarI 3 env{ onviari 4 envi enviarI 3 s it~ situarI 4 situ sit~ar1 5 cruz cruzar:I 6 cruc cruzar:t 7 jug jugax:t 8 jueg jugav:t 9 juegu jugar:t 10 jugu jugarTwo verb stems x and y will share the same secondstate number if and only if:, x has the same number of sterns as y,?
x has the same ending distribution as y.This permits a compression of the database sincethe set of sterns are gathered under a common sec-ond state number.
Other arguments in favor of thischoice of representation are given in section 4.1.For the 62 conjugation classes, grouped in threeverb conjugations, the number of stems combinedwith the various ending distributions creates a num-ber of verb-stem-final states close to 150.Defective verbs, due to their idiosyncrasies, arelisted separately?3.2 The adjective stemsThe adjective base tbrms (about 10,500) were de-rived fl'om the masculine singular Ibrms listed in thedictionary.
The lexical representation of a regularadjective has an entry in the lexicon as follows:i 300 buon buenowhere "buen-" is the stem and "bueno" (good) thedictionary base form.
Special attention eeded to bepaid to stressed adjectives like "musulmSn" (Mus-lim) or "mand&l" (bossy) where the inflected formdoes not keep the accent.
Therefore, both forms(stressed and unstressed) needed to be stored.3.3 The noun stemsAbout 30,700 nouns were extracted from the dictio-nary.
These nouns are not inflected for gender, butare simply listed as masculine or feminine.
Thus thearc label for a noun contains the complete form ofthe singular.
Some examples of arcs for nouns are:(a) 1(b) i499 aexodromoaorodromo noun masculine500 mariscosma~iscos ~toun masculine plnralIn the above examples, (a) can either generate a sin-gular lbrm or it can acquire the plural tbrm in afimher step, whereas (b), which occurs only in theplural, can have no Nrther inflection added.4 The  a f f i xesBesides the stems, various sublexicons containing"intermediary states" and affixes of different typesconstitute the other part of the Spanish arc list.4.1 Intermediary nodes or continua-tion classesThe regrouping of the verbal arc list by stem andperson allows reduction of the number of states andtherefore, of arcs.
For instance, an intermediarystate was added for the tenses only.
The arc marked"#" shows a transition on an empty string.2 150 # #This arc takes any verb stem of which tile final stateis 2 and links it to tile indicative present node - la-beled here 150-  of the "-at" verbs.
Consequently,there are as many nodes of that kind as tenses foreach group and verb category.3 2794.2 End ingsA series of sublexicons lists the inflections for theverbs, nouns and adjectives.
Verbal inflections are ofthe form:150 500 o Ist singular present indicative150 500 as 2nd singular present indicativeIn the same way, the regular endings for the adjec-tives are of the form:300 497 o adjective497 498 # masculine497 500 # singular498 500 s pluralEach transition corresponds tothe gender or numberfeature of the adjective.4.3 CliticsThe eleven Spanish clities can occur either alone orin combination (\[1\]).
Over sixty-five combinationscan be formed such as "seles", "noslas", etc.
The in-finitive, gerund and imperative are the only forms inwhich they can occur, for instance, "hacerlo" (to doit) or "dici6ndooslo" (saying it to you).
Nevertheless,they are sometimes subject o orthographic rules ofthe type: deletion of "s" for first person plural im-perative verbs in front of the enclitic "nos", such asin "anlanlonos '~ .Consequently, about 300 arcs were listed to handlethe general cases as well as the idiosyncrasies.4.4 Ref lex ive  verbsIn the case of reflexive verbs such as "aflliarse" (toafiliate, to join) or "abstenerse" (to abstain, to re-frain), a special treatment is motivated.
Such verbshave a paradigm like:(a) me afilio, (I afiliate)te afilias, (you afiliate)me afiliaba, (I .as afiliating)te a~liabas, (you were afiliating)(b) afiliandome (afiliating myself)afiliatet (afilla~e!
)The reflexive pronouns generally precede the verbform, separated from it by white space ms shown in(a), except for the infinitive, imperative and presentparticiple (example (b) above) a.
For the preced-ing reflexive pronouns, there is a dependency be-tween the person-and-number of the pronoun andthe person-and-number of the verbal ending, span-ning the intervening verb stem.
To capture such de-pendencies in a single automaton of the kind that3Note that some verbs (e.g.
"afillaxse") occur only reflex-ively, while other (e.g.
"lavar" (to wash, to clean)) may beused reflexively ornon reflexively.
Note also that object pro-nouns in general re cliticized, note only the reflexive ones .we are using, we would have to use a separate pathfor each person-number combination, duplicating theverb stem (and its allomorphs, if any) six times.
Thisseems like a bad idea.
A better alternative, in suchcases, is to set up the automaton to permit all re-flexive pronouns to co-occur with all endings, and tofilter the resulting set of tuples to remove the onesthat do not match.
This can be done, for example, bypassing the output hrough asecond automaton thatdoes nothing but check person and number agree-ment in reflexive verbs.We find it interesting that precisely those aspectsof Spanish morphology that require such a treatmentare those whose formatives are written as separatewords.4.5 P re f ixes  and  su f f i xesAbout 60 suffixes and 90 prefixes were added to thearc list for handling derivational morphology.
Onlytile very productive ones were selected.
The prefixesare of the form "nero-", "ante-", "auto-", "bio-" oc-curring with or without he dash; the suffixes are ofthe form "-ejo", "-eta", "-zuela", "-uelo", etc.The resulting arc list, in addition to supportingan efficient computation ofrelations between surfaceand lexical forms, provides a good overview of themorphological structure of the Spanish verbal, sys-tem, permitting easy access to the sets of verbs thatbehave in a similar way.5 Conc lus ionWe have implemented a complete morphological pro-cessor for Spanish, one which generates and recog-nizes all (and only) well-formed inflected and de-rived forms.
It covers about 95 % of Spanish textextracted from the EFE newswire text coming fromMadrid.
It has been linked to a browser for the Span-ish newswire and to the Collins bilingual dictionary(see Appendix), is also being utilized in the construc-tion of a Spanish parser (Donald ttindleat Bell Lab-oratories) and for further research in Spanish textanalysis.
We have found this model to be both simpleand powerful.
We plan to implement other Romancelanguages, and to experiment with German, wherethe treatment of compounds presents ome specialinterest.References\[1\] Casajuana R. and C. Rodr{guez 1985.
