Previous BioNLP Shared Tasks exer-cised semantic event extraction with a smallnumber of pre-defined event concepts.
TheGRO task of the BioNLP?13-ST imposes thechallenge of dealing with over 100 GRO con-cepts.
Its annotated corpus consists of 300MEDLINE abstracts, and an analysis of inter-annotator agreement on the annotations by twoexperts shows Kappa values between 43% and56%.
The results from the only participant arepromising with F-scores 22% (events) and63% (relations), and also lead us to open is-sues such as the need to consider the ontologystructure.1 BackgroundAs semantic resources in the biomedical domain,including ontologies and linked data, increase,there is a demand for semantic querying over thebiomedical literature, instead of the keywordsearching supported by conventional search en-gines (e.g.
PubMed).
The semantic search re-quires adapting Semantic Web technologies tothe literature, to analyze the complex semanticsdescribed in biomedical documents and to repre-sent them with ontology concepts and relations.The ontology-based formal semantics will thenform a Semantic Web.
The GRO task of theBioNLP Shared Tasks 2013 is to provide a plat-form to develop and evaluate systems for identi-fying complex semantic representation of bio-medical documents in the domain of gene regula-tion.There are solutions for servicing the ontologyconcepts recognized in the biomedical literature,including TextPresso (M?ller et al 2004) andGoPubMed (Doms and Schroeder, 2005).
Theyutilize term recognition methods to locate theoccurrences of ontology terms, together withterminological variations.
Systems like EBIMed(Rebholz-Schuhmann et al 2007) and FACTA(Tsuruoka et al 2008) go further to collect anddisplay co-occurrences of ontology terms.
How-ever, they do not extract events and relations ofthe semantic types defined in ontologies.The annotation of those ontology event and re-lation instances described in text was initiated inthe biomedical domain by the GENIA corpus(Kim et al 2003), and the tasks of the BioNLPShared Tasks 2009 and 2011 aimed at automati-cally identifying such ontological annotations.However, the tasks dealt only with a small num-ber of ontology concepts (less than 20 uniqueconcepts in total), considering the thousands ofconcepts defined in standard biomedical ontolo-gies (e.g.
Gene Ontology, anatomy ontologies).The goal of the Gene Regulation Ontology(GRO) task is to confirm if text mining tech-niques can be scaled up to cover hundreds of(and eventually thousands of) concepts, andthereby to address the complex semantic repre-sentation of biomedical documents.The GRO task is to automatically annotate bi-omedical documents with the Gene RegulationOntology (Beisswanger et al 2008).
GRO is a50conceptual model of gene regulation and in-cludes 507 concepts, which are cross-linked tosuch standard ontologies as Gene Ontology andSequence Ontology and are integrated into adeep hierarchical structure via is-a and part-ofrelations.
Note that many of the GRO conceptsare more specific than those used in the previousBioNLP Shared Tasks.
The GRO is one of thefirst ontological resources that bring togetherdifferent types of ontology concepts and relationsin a coherent structure.
It has two top-level cate-gories of concepts, Continuant and Occurrent,where the Occurrent branch has concepts forprocesses that are related to the regulation ofgene expression (e.g.
Transcription,RegulatoryProcess), and the Continuant branchhas concepts mainly for physical entities that areinvolved in those processes (e.g.
Gene, Protein,Cell).
It also defines semantic relations (e.g.hasAgent, locatedIn) that link the instances of theconcepts.
The GRO task in the BioNLP SharedTask (ST) 2013 assumes that the instances ofContinuant concepts are provided and focuses onextracting the instances of the events and rela-tions defined in the GRO.This paper is organized as follows: We de-scribe the manual construction of the trainingand test datasets for the task in Section 2 and ex-plain the evaluation criteria and the results inSection 3.2 Corpus annotation2.1 Annotation elementsThe BioNLP?13-ST GRO task follows the repre-sentation and task setting of the ST?09 and ST?11main tasks.
The representation involves threeprimary categories of annotation elements: enti-ties (i.e.
the instances of Continuant concepts),events (i.e.
those of Occurrent concepts) and re-lations.
Mentions of entities in text can be eithercontiguous or discontinuous spans that are as-signed the most specific and appropriate Contin-uant concepts (e.g.
TranscriptionFactor,CellularComponent).
The event annotation isassociated with the mention of a contiguous spanin text (called event trigger) that explicitly sug-gests the annotated event type (e.g.
?controls?
-RegulatoryProcess).
If a participant of an event,either an entity or another event, can be explicit-ly identified with a specific mention in text, theparticipant is annotated with its role in the event.In this task, we consider only two types of roles(i.e.
hasAgent, hasPatient), where an agent of anevent is the entity that causes or initiates theevent (e.g.
a protein that causes a regulationevent), and a patient of an event is the entity up-on which the event is carried out (e.g.
the genethat is expressed in a gene expression event)(Dowty, 1991).
The semantic relation annotationis to annotate other semantic relations (e.g.locatedIn, fromSpecies) between entities and/orevents, without event triggers.
Figure 1 illustratessome of the annotations.2.2 Document selectionThe corpus texts are selected based on the rele-vance to the topic of gene regulation in humans.Specifically, we first obtained a list of humantranscription factors (TFs) and then used Pub-Med to collect a set of candidate documents.
Arandom subset of 300 documents was then se-lected for the GRO task from the collection.
Weannotated entities, events, and relations in them,and divided them into three subsets of 150 (train-ing), 50 (development), and 100 (test) docu-ments.
In fact, 100 out of the 200 documents fortraining and development are from Kim et al(2011a), though we revised and updated theirannotations based on new annotation guidelines,some of which are explained below.2.3 Annotation guidelinesThe first step of annotating ontology concepts inthe text is the recognition of a word or a phrasethat refers to a concept of the GRO.
Such a wordor phrase, called mention, is one of the names ofthe concept, its synonyms, or expressions that aresemantically equivalent to or subsumed by theconcept.
For each mention, we annotate it withthe single, most specific and appropriate concept,but not with any general concept.
For example, ifFigure 1.
Example annotations of the GRO corpus51a protein is clearly mentioned as a transcriptionfactor in the text, we annotate it with the GROconcept TranscriptionFactor, not with Protein.There are many issues in the annotation, andwe here introduce our guidelines on two of themabout complex noun phrases and overlappingconcepts.1) If a noun phrase refers to an event that cor-responds to an Occurrent concept and includesmentions of other concepts, we consider sepa-rately annotating the multiple mentions in thephrase with concepts and relations.
For examplein the phrase ?nephric duct formation?, we anno-tate it as follows:?
?formation?
:CellularProcess hasPatient?nephric duct?
:CellThis means that the phrase indicates an individu-al of CellularProcess, which is an event of form-ing an entity of Cell, which is nephric duct.
An-other example noun phrase that involves multiplementions is ?Sim-2 mRNA expression?, which isannotated as follows:?
?expression?
:GeneExpression hasPatient(?mRNA?
:MessangerRNA encodes?Sim-2?
:Gene)However, we do not allow such multi-mentionannotation on e.g.?
?mRNA expression?, because this phraseis too generic and frequent so that a mul-ti-mention annotation for it, ?expres-sion?
:GeneExpression hasPatient?mRNA?
:MessangerRNA, does not en-code any ?useful?
information?
?nuclear factor?, because this factor isnot always located in nucleus.Therefore, we decided that, in general, we avoidannotation of generic information, but consider athread of information specific only if it involvesspecific entities like individual gene/protein andcell (e.g.
Sim-2, nephric duct).
Also, we did notdivide a noun phrase to multiple mentions if therelation between the mentions is not always true(cf.
?nuclear factor?
?
?factor?
:Protein locatedIn?nuclear?
:Nucleus).2) As some GRO concepts are overlapping, wemade the following guidelines:(a) When there is ambiguity between Increase(Decrease), Activation (Inhibition), andPositiveRegulation (NegativeRegulation), weannotateo binary relations with PositiveRegulation,ignoring Activation(e.g., ?augment?
:PositiveRegulation hasAgent?Nmi?
:Protein hasPatient (?recruit-ment?
:Transport hasPatient ?coactivator pro-tein?
: TranscriptionCoactivator))o unary relations with Increase(e.g., ?enhance?
:Increase hasPatient ?transcrip-tion?
:Transcription)Note that we cannot exchange the two conceptsof PositiveRegulation and Increase in the twoexamples due to the arity restriction.
(b) Binding concepts are ambiguous.
We anno-tate as follows:o For such a GRO concept as "Binding ofA to B", A should be the agent and B thepatient.
(For example, when we annotateBindingOfProteinToDNA andBindingOfTFToTFBindingSiteOfProtein, Proteinand TF will be agents, and DNA andBindingSiteOfProtein will be patients, respec-tively.
)o For such a GRO concept as "Binding toA" for binary relation between two enti-ties of the same type, both entities shouldbe patients.
(For example, in the events of binding betweenproteins with BindingToProtein and of bindingbetween RNAs with BindingToRNA, the pro-teins and the RNAs, respectively, will all be pa-tients.
)Other annotation guidelines can be found at thetask homepage1.2.4 AnnotationTwo annotators with biology background anno-tated the documents with GRO entities, eventsand relations.
They used the Web-based annota-tion tool brat (Stenetorp et al 2012) for the an-notation.
Annotator A is the one who annotatedthe earlier version of the corpus (Kim et al2011a).
He first revised the earlier version of 100abstracts (named Set 1) and drafted the new an-notation guidelines.
Annotator B studied thedrafted annotations and guidelines and then fur-ther revised them, and the two annotators togeth-er updated and made agreements on final ver-sions of the annotations and guidelines.
Theyselected two more sets of 100 abstracts each(named Sets 2 and 3), where Set 2 was combinedwith Set 1 to become the training and develop-ment datasets, and Set 3 became the test dataset.They updated the guidelines after annotating Sets2 and 3 independently and together combiningtheir annotations.1 http://nlp.sce.ntu.edu.sg/wiki/projects/bionlpst13grotask/52We estimated the inter-annotator agreement(IAA) between the two annotators for Sets 2 and3 with Kappa measures as shown in Table 1.
TheKappa values between 43% and 56% are moder-ately acceptable, though not substantial, which isexpected with the high degree of the ontology?scomplexity and also with the high number ofmentions (56 per abstract; see Table 2).
Note thatthe agreement is met, only when the two annota-tors annotate the same concept on the same men-tion with the same boundaries and, if any, thesame roles/arguments, not considering the gener-alization criteria used for evaluation (see Section3 for details).
If we relax the boundary restriction(i.e.
approximate span matching of (Kim et al2009)), the Kappa values for events slightly in-crease to 47% (Set 2) and 45% (Set 3).
Also notethat the agreement on relations is higher thanthose on entities and events.We analyzed the different annotations by thetwo annotators as follows: As for the entity anno-tations, 84% of the differences are boundarymismatches, while the rest are due to mismatchof entity types and to missing by either of theannotators.
As for the event annotations, 56% ofthe differences are also boundary mismatches,and 31% are missed by either of the annotators.The majority (71%) of the differences in relationannotations are due to missing by either annota-tor, while the rest are mostly due to the differ-ences in the entity annotations.One negative finding is that the agreement didnot always increase from Set 2 to Set 3, whichmeans the two annotators did not improve thealignment of their understanding about the anno-tation even after making agreements on Set 2annotations.
It may be too early to conclude, andthe Kappa value might increase as the annotatorsexamine more examples, since the annotationcorpus size in total (Sets 1,2,3 together) is stillsmall compared to the total number of GRO con-cepts.
After examining the IAA, we integratedthe independently annotated sets and released thefinal versions of the three datasets at the taskhomepage.Table 1.

Note that rela-tion instances are not associated with mentionslike event instances.
It also shows the number ofunique entity/event types (i.e.

Thetotal number of unique entity types in the threedatasets is 174, and that of unique event types is126.Table 2.

We compared the three datasets and ob-served that several event types (e.g.GeneticModification), which are popular in thetest dataset (e.g.
GeneticModification is the 12thfrequent type (2.3%)), seldom appear in the othertwo datasets.
It may indicate that the annotatorswere getting aware of (or familiar with) moreGRO concepts as they annotate more documents,where the test dataset is the last annotated.
Thissudden increase of frequency did not happen forthe entity annotations, possibly because the twoannotators were provided with candidate entityannotations, though of low quality, from a pre-liminary dictionary-based entity recognitionmethod and modified them.Table 3 shows the number of mentions for themost frequent top-level Continuant conceptssuch as InformationBiopolymer, whose sub-concepts include Gene and Protein, Cell, and53ExperimentalMethod.
Please note that these fre-quent concepts are closely related to the topic ofgene regulation, and that this distribution mayreflect to some degree the distribution of terms inthe sub-domain of gene regulation, but not that inthe whole MEDLINE.

(Bj?rne and Salakoski, 2013).
For comparisonpurposes, the GRO task organizers produced re-sults with a preliminary system by adapting ourexisting system, designated as OSEE (Kim andRebholz-Schuhmann, 2011b), for event extrac-tion and developing a simple machine learningmodel for relation identification.
We describethese two systems briefly and compare their re-sults with several criteria.3.1 System descriptionsTEES-2.1 is based on multi-step SVM classifica-tion, which automatically learns event annotationrules to train SVM classifiers and applies theclassifiers for 1) locating triggers, 2) identifyingevent arguments, and 3) selecting candidateevents.OSEE is a pattern matching system that learnslanguage patterns for event extraction from thetraining dataset and applies them to the test da-taset.
It performs the three steps of TEES-2.1 in asingle step of pattern matching, thus requiring ahuge amount of patterns (eventually, a pattern foreach combination of the features from the threesteps) and failing to consider that many featuresof a step are independent from other steeps andalso from event types and can thus be general-ized.We added a simple Na?ve Bayes model to thesystem for identifying (binary) semantic relationsbetween entities, which utilizes such features as54entity strings, the distance between them, and theshortest path between the two entities in the de-pendency structure of the source sentence, whichis identified by Enju parser (Sagae et al 2007).3.2 Evaluation criteriaThe GRO task follows some of the evaluationcriteria of the Genia Event Extraction (GE) taskof BioNLP-ST 2009 (Kim et al 2009), includ-ing strict and approximate matching, and alsointroduce new criteria that consider 1) the hierar-chical structure of the GRO and 2) parent and/orgrandparent of answer concept.
We here explainthese new criteria in detail.1) In this scheme of evaluation, the event re-sults of a participant are classified into the GROconcepts at the third level (see Table 4 for exam-ples), which are ancestors of their labeled clas-ses, and the evaluation results are accumulatedfor each of those concepts at the third level.
Thisscheme may give us insights on which categoriesthe participant system shows strength or weak-ness.2) This scheme is to deal with such a case thatthe answer class is "GeneExpression", but a par-ticipant gives "IntraCellularProcess" or"MolecularProcess", which are the parent andgrandparent of the answer class, thus not entirelywrong nor too generic.
For example, the scheme"Allowing parents" allows "IntraCellularProcess"to be a correct match to the answer class"GeneExpression", as well as the answer classitself.
"Allowing grandparents" accepts thegrandparents of answer classes as well as theparents.3.3 Evaluation resultsTable 6 shows the evaluation results of the twosystems.
Note that all the evaluation results interms of precision, recall, and F-score in all thetables are percentages.
The performance of theTEES-2.1 systems, which is clearly better thanthe OSEE system, is lower than its performancefor other tasks of the BioNLP?13-ST, which isunderstandable, considering 1) the higher num-ber of GRO concepts than those for the othertasks and 2) the low Kappa value of the inter-annotator agreement.It also shows that the evaluation scheme that al-lows the parents/grandparents of answer con-cepts for acceptance does not greatly help in-creasing the performance, which may mean thatthe systems are designed to aim individual con-cepts, not considering the ontology structure.This issue of considering the structure of the on-tology in event extraction can be an interestingfuture work.Table 6.

It shows that the systems are good atextracting events of the categories ofMolecularProcess (e.g.
GeneExpression) andLocalization (e.g.
Transport), but are, expectedly,poor at extracting events of the categories withsmall number of training data (e.g.
Decrease,ResponseProcess).Table 7.

From the results,we observe that the system performance for anevent class does not reflect the number of train-55ing data of the class, and that the performance ofthe syntactic pattern matching system OSEE ishigh for the event classes, for which the machinelearning system TEES-2.1 also performs well.These observations may indicate that the currentapproaches to event extraction deal with eventtypes independently, not considering the hierar-chical (or semantic) relations between the eventtypes nor relations between entity types.Table 8.

These results of TEES inthe relation identification of the GRO task (F-scores between 50% and 87%) are much higherthan the best results of relation identification(40% F-score) in the Bacteria Biotopes (BB) task(N?dellec et al 2013), which is to extract rela-tions of localization and part-of.
Though the tworelation identification tasks of GRO and BB can-not be directly compared due to many differ-ences (e.g.
entity types, relation types, corpussources), it may indicate that the GRO task cor-pus has been annotated consistently enough totrain a model with such high performance andthat the low performance of event extractioncompared to relation identification may be due tothe big number of event types and would be re-solved as the corpus size increases.Table 9.

GRO) andthe more complex semantic representation inGRO compared to those in other ontologies usedfor ontology-based event extraction.
The com-plex structure of the GRO enables us to evaluateparticipant systems at different abstrac-tion/generalization levels.
The evaluation resultsof the participant are quite promising, leading usto open issues in this direction, including the in-corporation of ontology structure in event extrac-tion.
We plan to extend the corpus semi-automatically by incrementally updating theevent extraction system with more training data.ReferencesE.
