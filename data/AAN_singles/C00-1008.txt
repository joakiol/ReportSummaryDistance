Here westmnnarize only essential points and ignore highlyirregular and archaic inilections (cf.
figure 4 below).Gernmn nouns l)ear gender (masculine, tbininine,neutt,r) and are inflected for number (singular, 1)lu-rail and case (nontilmt.ive, accusative, dat.ive, geni-(ire).
\Vith the exeq)(;ion of class NWN (e.g.
mastHa.
'uvr 'farnwr': wi(;h gen sg f~aucrn,), all nonfl:mininenouns build genitive singular with -s.The "regular" (of.
()lahsen (1999))but; "atytfi-cal" (cf.
\\qlnderlich (1999)) nouns of class NA (e.g.Auto ~car') build their plural forms in -s. The l)luralforms of all o(;her (i.e.
%yl)ical') (:lasses nmst endill a so-called schwa syllable -c, -el, - c'r, or -en (i.e.l)honetically all unstressed \[o\] ta)llowed by a sonoranl,f~'olll \[1 , .\]).S(;l'()llg lIOllllS add -e for l)lural ill class NS (e.g.A'r'm, 'arm', pl A'rm, c) and class NU (e.g.
d~'zt 'l)hysi-clan', pl /{rztc) if (;he sl;enl itself does not alreadyend in a schwa syllable (e.g.
Kabcl 'cable', pl Ka-bell.
Class NU flwthermore umlauts the stem (i.e.replaces a, o, ,it,, au  with ii, 5, ii, iiu, respectively), asdoes (:lass NR (e.g.
Mann 'man',  pl \]VIiinncr), whichadds - er.The remaining (:lasses (NM, NWN, and NWS)t'onn their plural ill -n (e.g.
Schraube  'screw', plSch, rauben).
The nonnominative singular stenl inclass NWN (e.g.
lIasc 'hare', gen sg Hasen) andclass NWS (e.g.
Glaubc 'belief', gen sg Glaubcns)is identical with the phlral fornL while N\VN excel>(;iolmlly adds no -s in genitive singular.All (:lasses except NA build dative plural byadding -n (;o the phn'al Ibrm if it is not alreadypresent (e.g.
Miinncr 'men', dat pl Miinncrn butItascn 'hares', dat pl Hascn).49Figure 1: hierarchy of inflectional schemata(nil_sorts_gen~sg~sort n_dat_pl_sort l)lur_infl~sort n_obl_sg_sort n_gen~sg_sorts_pl-sort strong_pl_sort n_pLsortschwa_pl~sort erq)l_sort umlaut_pl~sort3 Representat ion  of  in f lec t iona lmorpho logyVarious proposals have been made for the represen-tation of inflectional morphology within constraint-based frameworks like HPSG (cf.
Pollard (1994)).We neither adopt a word-syntax al)proach like thatof (Krieger and Nerbonne, 1.993) assunfing lexicalentries tbr inflectional affixes as well as roots, nor dowe make use of lexical rules, as (Meurers and Min-nen, 1997) do.Instead, we follow (Riehemmm, 1.998) in formu-lating hierarchically structured schemata of the kindshe has developed for derivational morphology l)utapply them here to inflection and thus carry out akind of inflectional analysis without lexical rules asprojected by (Erjavec, 1996).
Our schemata cap-ture inflectional paradigms and can be regarded asrela.tional constraints that relate stems, affixes, andinflected lexical forms.Figure 1 shows our hierarchy of inttectionalschemata, wlfile figure 2 illustrates a concreteschema, namely that tbr the schwa plural of inflec-tional (:lass NS.
Ill figure 2 l;he attribute ftype standsfbr the intlectional class.
The attributes flex, surf,and base represent strings, namely the inflectionalending, surface (i.e.
inflected) tbrm, and base formrespectively.
The symbol @ denotes the reducedvowel \[o\] (schwa), and - designates negated values.Lexical entries are assmned only for basic lexicalsigns (i.e.
uninflected but possibly derived or com-pounded).
Inflected lexical signs result from the in-teraction of these lexical entries and the inflectionalsehenlata.
Figure 3 gives the basic lexical sign (withthe onfission of feature specifications that are irrel-ewmt for this discussion) for Hund 'dog', which isof class NS, followed by the inflected lexical sign tbrHunde 'dogs', in which the value of the attributemoph (i.e.
morphophonology) is an extension of theschema for schwa phlral given in figure 2.The inflectional classes assigned to basic lexicalsigns are modelled as formal types in the hierarchi-cal structure specified in figure 4.
Note that theleaves of this tree correspond exactly to the inflec-tional classes of German nouns as described abovein {}2.Morphophonemic and morlfltographemic alterna-Figure 2: schema for schwa-phn'al (sehwa_pl_sort)"schwa_plftype nsflex ?surf atombase atombasic_Is Jstem moph basicagr \[case-avmlcase |ctxt ~ daqagr kgen top Jhum plugend - ,fcm?ers pcr.s(;ions as shown in nominative plural Zcit-cn 'tinles'but Gabel-n 'forks' are also covered ill our descrip-tion.

Inagreement with (Bird and Klein, 1994) and (Er\]avec,1996), we capture such alternations declaratively ina one-level model without recourse to transducers.Our treatment of umlaut adopts part of the tech-niques of (%'ost, 1993).4 Process ing  unknown wordsIn our al)proach linguistic prol)erties of unlcnownwords are inferred fl'om their sentential context asa byproduct of parsing.
After parsing, which re-quires only a slight modification of sl;andard lexi-cal lookup, lexical entries are al)propriately updated.One of our key ideas is a gradual, information-basedconcept of "unknownness", where lexical entries arenot unknown as a whole, but may contain unknown,i.e.
potentially revisable, pieces of information (cf.Barg and Walther (1998)).
This allows a uniformtreatment for tile full range of lexical entries fromcompletely known to maximally unknown.
As dis-cussed in (Barg and Walther, 1998), our system hasbeen implemented in MicroCUF, a derivative of thetbrmalism CUF of (DSrre and Dorna, 1993).50Figure 3: feature sl~ruci;ures for \]I'lmd and Hv.nd(;ba.sic_l.s-basicftype n.5surf KI h.umlbase E\]a.q'~'moph rca.sc'_avm \]case /ctxt" go.,|agr Lgen r:(~.sc jI IU  I l l  ,siw\]gend ?tt, a,scpers thirdsynsem ...-inJlccted_Ls"sch, w(t_l~lftype \ [ \ ]  'n,uflex ~)surf h,'u, mh~base \ [ \ ]  h,u'l~dagr\[ ca.sc_avm/,j case ctxt " d(~agr Lgen (:( l ,s~: jhum plugend ~ 'ma,sc:)ers \ [ \ ]  tll, i rdmoph -ba.~ic_l,~'-ha.sicftype \[~surf \ [ \ ]base \ [ \ ]s\[emsynsem ...moph~grsynsem \ [ \ ]a~\]r\[ca,sc_av'm.

the information can be acquired andupdaix'~d.
Figure 5 shows (;he basic lexical sigll forGerman norms (with the Olllissioll of tbai;m'e Sl)eciti-cal;ions ~haI~ arc irrelevanl, fi/r l;his (tiscussion).Whereas intleci;ional class (ftype), number (num),51Figure 4: hierarchy of inflectional typesnouiL\[loxNA typieal_tlexstrong_flex nasM_tlexNS NU NR NM weak_flexNWN NWSand gender (gend) are specializable, case is general-izable and hence contains the features gen and ctxt.Note that the initial values for specializable infor-mation consist of a disjunction (;) of the value u_sand the most general appropriate value for the corre-sponding feature.
This ensures the identification ofspecializable infornlation (via ~t_s) on the one hand,and the correct specializations on the other.\Vhen a sentence containing an tlnknown noun isparsed, infbrmation about the noun conies from dif-ferent som'ces: while the surrounding context lnaysupply agreement information, the word fornl itselftogether with morphol)honological constraints mayrestrict the possible inflectional class.As an examt)le we can suppose that the rather in-frequent noun Sund 'sound', 'strait', which like It'und'dog' belongs to class NS but is unfalniliar to inanyGerman speakers, is not recorded in a given lexicon.The class NS contains both masculine and neuternouns, and these differ ill none of their inflectedforms.
Thus, only agreement information from acontext, such as dcr cnge ?
'und 'the narrow strait'(nonfinative), call establish the gender of S.w(td asbeing masculine.Figure 5: feature structure for the underspecifiedlexical entry-basic_Is-basicftype (noun_flex;u_s)surf \[\] atombase \[\]"czcjl ~.moph \[ case_aw~case /ctxt case~gr kgen u_gnum (num;u_s)gend (9cnd;u_s))ers thirdsynsem .
.
.Even in isolation, the forln Sund must be singu-lar since its final shape is not coml)atible with anyphlral inflection (i.e.
it ends neither ill -s nor ill aschwa syllable).
Moreover, the morphoplionologicalconstraiuts on stems allow only three possibilities:S'und is?
femiuine (and then tile class is NA, NU, or NMand tile case is underspecified)?
nonfenfinine and weak (i.e.
(:lass NWN orNWS) (and tlmn the case must be nominative)?
nonfbminine and nonweak (and then the case isnot genitive)These hypotheses are captured in the three featurestructures depicted in figure 6.As we have seen, when a word is parsed in context,this provides additional information.
If we know, forexalnple, that S~tnd is lnasculine, the first hypothesisis excluded, and the gender specification of the re-maining two hylmtheses can be specializ&l to masc.If we additionally encounter S'und ill dative singu-lar, which is impossible for weak nouns (which nmsthave a final -n), then only the third hypothesis re-mains.
Finally, if the plural form S'undc occurs thesystem can specialize the inflectional class exactly tothe type NS.
The other morphological informationcammt be further generalized or specialized, and wehave the final lexical entry fbr Sund.Things are not always this easy.
In particular,there may be a number of alternatives both fbr thesegmentation of a form into a stem and an inflec-tional ending and ibr the ~ssignment of a stein to alexeme.
Moreover, these alternatives may depend oneach other.
Thus, the form Lcincn may be assignedto any of the lexemes Lein 'flax' (masc, NS), Leine'rope' (fern, NM), or Leincn 'linen' (neut, NS); evenin a context, e.g.
F'ritz verkauft Leinen 'Fritz sellsropes/linen', it may be impossible to disambiguatethe form.
While the nouns Band 'book volume'(mase, NU), Band 'strip' (neut, NR), Band 'bond'(neut, NS, archaic and rare in singular), Band 'musicband' (fern, NA), and Bande 'gang' (fern, NM) maybe unlikely to occur all in the same context, theyilhlstrate the dimension of the t)roblems of segmen-tation and lexical assignnlent, which in turn coil-52Figure 6: hyl)othescs fi)r ,5"u'nd-basic_Isbasicftype (ns;nu, nm;u_s)surf \[\] sundbase \[\]ayfl"moph \[ casc_avn\[case /ctxt (-a,sctgr Lgen 'u_qhum (,siny;u_,s)gend (fcm;u_~)~ers thirdsynsem ...-basic_Isbasicftype dnw;,l_,~')surf \[\] su'ndbase \[\]mophagrsynsem .

\Ve haveno magic solution f'or the latter, but in our approachsuch examples must be handled with disjmwtive rep-resentations until the context 1)rovides the necessarydisambiguating infornmtion.6 An  a l te rnat ive  mode l  us ingf inite-state techniquesAlternatively, the incremental identifieation of in-flectional types can be modelled within the Dame-work of finite-state automata (cf.
Sln'oat (1992))without recourse to unification-based grammar for-malisms.
A FSA can be defined that has an all)ha-1)et consisting of vectors specifying the stem shal)eand ending (and thus the segmentation) as well astim agreenlcnt inforniation of possible word forms.Starting in an initial state corresponding to the con-straints that apply to all unknown words, the FSAis moved by successive forms of an unknown lexemetogether with their agreement information into suc-cesso," states that capture the incrementally accruedinflectional intbrmation.
The FSA may reach a finalstate, in which case tile intlectional class has l)eenuniquely idenl;ified, or it nlay renmin in a nonfinalstate.
A lexic.on would siml)ly recoM tile latest stateroached for each ll()llll.Imlflcnlentation of t.his model is greatly compli-cated by the problems of (lisambiguation just dis-cussed in {i5.
In general, the states of the FSA mustcapture disjmmtions not only of intlectional classes,lint also of segmentation and gender alternatives.The application of automatic induction techniquesto corpora appears to be essential, and we are cur-rently f)ursuing possibilities for this.7 Conc lus ionWe have taken the inflec.tion of German nouns to il-lustrate a general tyl)e-based at/1)roach to handlingultkltowll words alia the illcrelllental accrual of theirlexical information.
The techniques can be al)l/liednot only to other classes of inflected words and toother languages, 1)ut also to other aspects of lexicalinformal;ion such as the valency of verbs.
This mayallow practical systems for natural anguage process-ing to be enhanced so as to utilize input infornlationthat otherwise is discarded as noise.ReferencesPetra Barg and Markus Walther.
