Exemplar-Based Sense ModulationMohsen Rais-Ghasem (mohsen@scs.earleton.ea)Jean-Pierre Corriveau (jeanpier@ses.carleton.ca)School of Computer Science; Carleton UniversityOttawa, ON, K1S 5B6 CanadaAbstractA great deal of psycholinguistic f ndings reveal that context highlights or obscurescertain aspects in the meaning of a word (viz., word sense modulation).
Computationalmodels of lexicon, however, are mostly concerned with the ways context selects ameaning for a word (word sense selection).
In this paper, we propose a model thatcombines sense selection with sense modulation.
Word senses in this proposal consist ofa sense-concept and a sense-view.
Furthermore, we outline an exemplar-based approachin which se~se-views are developed gradually and incrementally.
A prototypeimplementation of this model for sentential context isalso briefly discussed.1.
IntroductionThe main focus of this paper is the effects ofcontext in modulating the meaningrepresentation of an unambiguous noun as itappears in different contexts.
The role ofcontext in many existing computational lexiconsends once one reading, out of a number ofcontrasting readings, ~s selected.
However,many psycholinguistic findings indicate thatcontext affects the storage and retrieval ofconcepts.
In this paper, we will argue thatlexicon models must account for both senseselection and sense modulation (see Cruse,1986).We first motivate our work by emphasizingthe inability of existing lexicon models toaccount for contextual effects at a level finerthan the sense level.
We then discuss ourproposed model, which represents word sensesas pairs of sense-concepts/sense-views.
We willalso describe how sense-views evolve from anumber of exemplars.
The paper concludes witha brief description of an implemented prototypeand results of some experiments.2.
MotivationsElsewhere (Rais-Ghasem, 1998), the first authorhas reviewed existing computational lexiconmodels and showed that, despite theirdifferences, they all subscribe to the samemeaning theory, namely sense enumeration(Seidenberg et al, 1982; Simpson and Burgess,1985).
Fundamental to this theory are twoassumptions: 1) the possibility of listing orenumerating all possible meanings for eachword, and 2) the existence of a selection processin which one of these meanings is selected for agiven word.One of the main disadvantages of suchenumerative l xicons is their inability to accountfor a phenomenon generally known as semanticflexibility (see Barclay et al, 1974; Barsalou,1993; Greenspan, 1986).
In short, semanticflexibility concerns changes that context causesin representation of concepts in memory.
Manypsycholinguistic findings have shown thatcontext seems to highlight or obscure certainproperties of a single concept as it appears indifferent contexts.
For example, in an earlyexperiment, Barclay et al (1974) demonstratedhow the interpretations o f  familiar,unambiguous words vary with context.
Forinstance, they argued that the choice ofattributes for piano is affected by the verbselection in The man (l~ed) (tuned) (smashed)(sat on) (photographed) the piano.
They thenprovided evidence that the prior acquisition of asentence like The man lifted the piano (vs. Theman tuned the piano) influences theeffectiveness of cues like "something heavy"(vs. "'something with a nice sound") in recall.They concluded that context can affect theencoding of concepts in memory.
Similarly,Barsalou (1982) reported that subjects verifycontextually relevant properties significantlyfaster than contextually irrelevant propertiesWitney et al (1985) also report similarresults.
Their work is particularly interestingsince they distinguished between two levels ofproperty activation: 1) the functional level(useful in activities such as sentencecomprehension and classification), and 2) thesemantic access level (corresponding to theinformation that is actually accessed upon85seeing a word).
They used intervals of 0, 300and 600 ms.-and found that all properties of aword were initially activated (accessed),regardless of the context.
However, thecontextually irrelevant ('low-dominant' in theirterminology) properties would die off rapidly,and hence play a negligible role in the overallsentence comprehension.Greenspan (1986) studied the effect ofsentential context on concrete nouns.
Heexamined the presence of central and peripheralproperties of a noun in different contexts.
For agiven a noun, Greenspan presented his subjectswith a pair of sentences where in each sentencea different type of properties was emphasized.For example, consider the noun basket.
Being acontainer is a central property for basketwhereas being made of straw is a peripheral one.Each of the following sentences focuses on oneof these properties.The butler placed the letter in the basket.
(Container)Sally took several days to weave the basket.
(Straw)Later he examined subjects' recall in variousmemory tasks and found that the centralproperties were activated regardless of thecontext, but peripheral properties were activatedonly if they were emphasized by the sentence.He further showed that the emphasized centralproperties were more activated thanunemphasized central properties.
He concludedthat the interpretation of a concrete noun is afunction of both the sentential context and thenoun's central properties (Ibid.
).Anderson et al (1976) demonstrated thatgeneral terms are contextually instantiated tomore specific terms.
For example, they usedfish in contexts like the following sentences andhypothesized that it was likely to be instantiatedrespectively to goldfish, trout and shark.The grocer stared at the fish in the bowl.The grocer stared at the fish in the stream.The fish attacked the swimmer.They examined their hypothesis in a number ofexperiments and found that an expectedinstantiated term was a better cue for the recallof a sentence then the general term itself, eventhough the general term had appeared in thesentence and the particular term had not.To the best of our knowledge, none of theexisting computational lexicon models haveadequately dealt with semantic flexibility.Having subscribed to the sense enumerationtheory, the effects of context in these models arelimited to selecting of one sense.
Any changesin the characteristics of a selected sense eitherhas to come in the form of a new sense or isignored.This requires the ability to foresee any contextthat a word can appear in and define a separatesense for it.
Obviously, this is impractical, if notimpossible (see Corriveau, 1995, chapter 2).Thus, any lexicon model must support acombination of sense generation and senseselection.Of the various computational lexicon models,this issue is specially problematic for symboliclexicons (e.g., Dyer, 1982; Wilensky, 1978) andlexicons based on semantic networks (Lange &Dyer, 1989; Waltz & Pollack, 1985).
This is dueto the fact that word senses in these models arecoded as discrete ntries.Owing to their adopted continuousrepresentation, connectionist models, however,are potentially capable of dealing withcontextual effects at a finer level.
In factMcClelland and Kawamoto (1986) reported anunintended yet interesting result.
They hadpresented their model with The ball broke thevase.
Although throughout the training ball wasalways associated with the microfeature soft, inthe output it was associated with themicrofeature hard.
They attributed this result tothe fact that breakers in their experiment wereall hard and the model had shaded the meaningof ball accordingly.However, the connectionist approach also hassome disadvantages.
First of all, connectionistlexicons presuppose a set of universal and fixedmicrofeatures and demand that every sense becharacterized in terms of such microfeatures inadvance.
This constitutes a serious problem forany real world application.But what is even more important is thedifficulty to separate patterns of contextualeffects from the representation of a word sense.For instance, consider breakers in McClellandand Kawamoto (1986).
It is impossible toexamine this category of objects by itself.
Thuswe cannot determine 1) what qualifies an objectto be a breaker or 2) what else can be abreaker?We believe separating patterns of contextualeffects from internal representations of contextis important.
Firstly, such patterns can bethought of as ad hoc categories, categories builtby people to achieve goals (Barsalou, 1983).
Forinstance, the breakers category can beinstrumental in achieving the goal of "breakinga window".
Secondly, from a learning point ofview, such patterns can be very useful.
Rais-Ghasem (1998) has shown how a concept canevolve (i.e., acquires new properties) from such86patterns as it appears in various contexts.
Also,Rais-Ghasem (Ibid.)
has employed such patternsto implement a metaphor understanding systemthat interprets metaphors as class inclusionassertions ( ee Gluksberg & Keysar, 1990).3.
A Lexicon for Sense ModulationIn this section, we propose a lexical model thatnot only selects enses for input words, but alsocontextually modulates the selected senses.Examples used in this section are from aprototype implementation of this model forsentential contexts.3.1 Two-Tiered Word SensesCruse (1986) specifies two ways in whichcontext affects the semantic ontribution of aword: sense selection and sense modulation.Sense selection happens in cases of lexicalambiguity where one sense is chosen among anumber of contrastive senses (see Pustejovsky,1995) associated with a word.
In sensemodulation, the semantic characteristics of aselected sense are modulated according to itssurrounding context.
Cruse describes two typesof sense modulation: a) highlighting orbackgrounding, and b) promotion or demotionof features.
In the former, context underlinescertain aspects (i.e., properties) of the conceptselected for a given word while dimming others,as it happens for piano in the followingexamples:The musician played the piano.The musician broke the piano.The musician lifted the piano.Context can also promote, or demote, certainaspects of a word's associated concept.
Forinstance, teacher, by definition, is genderneutral.
However, in a context like thefollowing, the feature gender is promoted forteacher.The teacher stroked his beard.Similarly, certain aspects can be demoted, as issolidity, a property usually associated withbutter, in this context:Mary poured the butter into the jar.To account for both sense selection and sensemodulation, we propose to structure wordsenses into two tiers: sense-concept tier andsense-view tier (see Figure 1).
While the sense-concept tier specifies the core meaning of aword in a given context, the sense-view tierspecifies how this meaning is to be viewed inthat context.
It is our contention that this simplestructure is capable of accounting for varioustypes of sense modulation.Sense-Concept JFigure 1: Two-tiered word sense.Here is an example of the word sense generatedby the implemented prototype (see section 4) forpiano in The musician moved the piano.\[Sense-Concept(s)\] PIANO\[Sense View\]W EIGHT(0.666667)---->:H EAVY,STATE-OF-MATTER(0.756)---->:SOLID,IsKindOf-ARTIFACT(0.7047)---->:COLOR(0.7047)---->:AGE(0.7047)---->:OPERATED-BY(0.7047)o--->:HUMAN,As shown, this word sense consists of two parts:a sense-concept and a sense-view.
Sinceconcepts to a large extent are conventionalized,sense-concepts are specified only by means ofthe concepts they represent (concept PIANO inthis case).
Sense-views, however, are specifiedas a set of properties (e.g., WEIGHT) and theirpossible values (e.g., HEAVY).
Each property isalso accompanied with a number between 0 and1 indicating the property's weight (or centrality)in a given sense-view.
The implemented systemrelies on the Mikrokosmos ontology (Maheshand Nirenburg, 1995) to specify properties forsense-concepts and sense-views j.Now, compare the above word sense with theword sense generated for piano in a differentcontext such as The musician played the piano.\[Sense-Concept(s)\] PIANO\[Sense View\]IsKindOf-MUSlCAL-INSTRUMENT(0.81 )?--->:WORK-EQUIPMENT-OF(0.81)---o>:MUSICIAN,IsKindOf-ARTIFACT(0.729)---->:STATE-OF-MATTER(0.729)---->:SOLID,COLOR(0.729)---->:AGE(0.729)---->:OPERATED-BY(0.729)---->:HUMAN,IsKindOf-INANIMATE(0.6561 )---->:I It must be noted that our model is not dependent on anyparticular ontology or set of properties.
The choice ofMikrokosmos is primarily justified because of itsavailability and relative comprehensiveness.87Note that the two word senses share the samesense-concept.
They differ, however, on theirsense-views.
Because of the sense-view, the firstword sense portrays piano as an object ofmoving (by highlighting properties such asweight and artifact).
Conversely, the secondword sense underlines a different aspect ofpiano, namely the fact that it is a musicalInstrument.As examples of property demotion/promotion,consider the word senses respectively generatedfor mttsician in the above two contexts.
In thefirst context, we get:\[Sense-Concept(s)\] MUSICIAN\[Sense View\]GENDER(0.885367)---->:MALE,IsKindOf-H UMAN(0.8187)---->:IsKindOf-P RIMATE(0.54)---->:Notice how all properties pecific to musicianare demoted in this example, since they areirrelevant o the role played by musician in thiscontext (i.e.. being a mover).
This is not the casein The musician played the piano.\[Sense-Concept(s)\] MUSICIAN\[Sense View\]WORK-EQUIPMENT(1)---->:MUSICAI-INSTRUMENT,AREA-OF-INTEREST(1)---->:FIELD-OF-MUSIC,IsKindOf- ENTERTAINM ENT-ROLE(0.9)---->:IsKindOf-ARTISTIC-ROLE(0.81 )---->:IsKindOf-SOCIAL-ROLE(0.729)---->:IsKindOf-HUMAN(0.6561 )---->:GENDER(0.6561 )---->:IsKindOf-SOCIAL-OBJ ECT(0.6561 )---->:3.2 Exemplar -Based Sense-ViewsIn this section, we outline a lexicon model inxvhich sense-views are developed gradually andincrementally.
That is achieved by exploitingexemplars 2.
Exemplars are previously processedcontexts that exemplify the usage of wordsenses.
In other words, every exemplar consistsof a number of word senses, each of the latterformed by a pair of the form (sense-concept/sense-view).We first define the alike relationship:Definition 1: Sense-concepts SC, and SC 2 arealike if they appear in similar contexts, and theyshare the same thematic role.For example, according to this relationship,piano, fridge and computer are alike in thefollowing inputs:They used a crane to move the stove.2 Similar to semantic relations in Cruse (1986).John carried the computer.Four men moved the piano.In other words, from the view point of "beingmoved", these representationally differentsense-concepts can be classified together.This parallels the two different roles thatFranks (1995) proposed for concepts.
Hedistinguished between the representational ndclassificatory functions of concepts.
While theformer is used to discem instances of oneconcept from others, the latter specifies how aninstance of a concept should be classified.Franks (Ibid.)
argues that, depending on context,fake gun could be classified along with a gun, atoy, a replica, and a model.Given that all alike sense-concepts share thesame sense-view, we can define a sense-view asthe intersection of the properties of the sense-concepts that are connected to it.
Figure 2illustrates this situation.Figure 2: A shared sense-view.A sense-view is initialized to the properties ofthe first sense-concept to join it.
As more sense-concepts join, the sense-view evolves to betterreflect what is common between all those sense-concepts.
For example, the following is thecontent of the sense-view object of movinginitiated with only one exemplar:The man moved the stove.\[Sense View\]Thematic Role: Object - No.

After addingcomputer, as it appears in:The student moved the computer.we get:\[Sense ViewlThematic Role: Object - No.

The modification of a sense-viewcontinues until the sense-view reaches a certainlevel of stability (for more details, see Rais-Ghasem, 1998).3.3 F rom Words to SensesHaving described the two-tiered word sensesand our adopted exemplar-based approach todevelop sense-views, we can now overview themodels overall behavior.Input to the system is a context, presented as anumber of input words and along with theirsyntactic ategories and case markers (Delisle etal., 1993).
For example, a sentence like Themusician played the piano would be presentedto the model as musician (noun, p-subj), play(verb, -), and piano (noun, p-obj).
Case markersp-subj and p-obj respectively indicate"positional subject" and "positional object".The goal is first, to select proper senses forinput words, and second, to contextuallymodulate those senses.
The model attempts toaccomplish both tasks by looking for an3 This process also meets, to some extent, anotherrequirement, namely idiosyncrasy of word senses.
Forexample, the property hem 3 ' is present in this sense-viewonly because of its strong presence in the sense-conceptsadded to this sense-view so far.
That may not be the casefor another eader and may not hold over time.89adaptable exemplar.
Adaptability between astored exemplar and an input context is definedas follows:Definition 2: Adaptability between an exemplarcontext C~ and an input context C, is a function(f) of the compatibility between the sense-viewsassociated with C~ and their thematicallycorresponding concepts in C,.
Compatibilitybetween a sense-view and a concept is definedbased on the degree of overlap in theirproperties.For instance, assume that the model alreadymaintains the following exemplars:El.
The musician played the guitar.E2.
Mary played soccer.Also suppose the following input is presented tothe model.John played the piano.To determine the adaptability of this input withE1 and E2, we should first find sense-viewscorresponding to the input words, and thenmeasure their compatibility.
Let us assume thatwe know that the input words John, play andpiano respectively correspond to sense-viewsassociated with musician, play and guitar in E1and sense-views associated with Mary, play andsoccer in E2.Let's begin with E2.
It is possible to select asense for the input word John which iscompatible with sport-player (the sense-viewassociated with Mary).
The same is true forinput word play and the sense-view playing-sport.
However, finding a sense for piano whichis compatible with the sense-view sport(soccer's associated sense-view) is not possible.Therefore, the input context and E2 are notadaptable.Conversely, E1 and the input context, areadaptable: John is compatible with music-player(musician's associated sense-view), play withplaying-music, and piano with musical-Instrument.Adaptability, in fact, allows the model todecide if a set of word senses can be selected orgenerated for the input words.
Put roughly,given some input words, the resulting wordsenses must be reusable together in an adaptableexemplar (see Rais-Ghasem, 1998, for moredetails).In Definition 2, correspondence b tween aninput word and a sense-view as defined basedon the thematic roles.
Since thematic roles areunknown for the input words, the implementedsystem relies on case markers to findcorresponding sense-views for an input word.Every sense-views maintains a list of casemarkers (which may evolve as new membersjoin).
Here is an example of the sense-viewbreakin,~-instrument.\[Sense View\]Thematic Role: Instrument - Marker(s): with-pp, p-subj,STATE-OF-MATTER(0.73305)--->:SOLID,MADE-OF(0.82805)---->: MATERIAL,The markers with-pp and p-subj indicate thatbreakers are usually marked either as subject orwith-prepositional phrase in the input.
Here areexamples:The thief broke the windshield with a bat.The rack smashed the window.Once an adaptable xemplar is found, the modelnot only knows what senses must be selected forthe input words, but also by associating thesesenses with their corresponding sense-views, theselected senses will be modulated.
For example,John in the above example will be associatedwith the sense-view music-player (a case ofproperty promotion).
Similarly, the word playwill be disambiguated _to playing-music (asopposed to plavin,~-sport in E2).4.
Implemented PrototypeThe implemented system is structured in twomarker passing networks.
The bottom network,the ontology network, serves as the systemknowledge base to define concepts in the secondnetwork.
This definition includes conceptproperties and relationships between concepts.We used Mikrokosmos ontology (Mahesh &Nirenburg, 1995).The second network, the lexicon network,consists of four layers of nodes.
Figure 3displays the schematic structure of the lexiconnetwork.
Lexemes, (displayed as squares)appear at the bottom.
Connected to lexemes areconcepts (rounded rectangles).
Concepts areconnected exemplars (double-lined rectangles).Exemplars constst of a number of sense-concepts (occurrences of concepts inexemplars).
Associated with each sense-conceptis a sense-view (displayed as banners).Figure 3: The structure of the lexicon network.90The process begins when input words arelooked up the in ontology and theircorresponding lexemes are found.
Conceptsconnected to these lexemes are then activatedwhich, in turn, leads to activation of allexemplars in which input words appear.Exemplars activated for a word, or moreprecisely, for the word's associated concepts,represent he model's knowledge, up to thatpoint, of various ways that the input word caninteract with other words.In the implemented system, determiningadaptability is carried out simultaneously andconcurrently by individual exemplars triggeredby input words.
Attached to each exemplars (infact, attached to a .group of exemplars withsirnilar context) is an agent.
Agents,(implemented as Java TM threads) receiveactivation and individually start measuring theadaptability of their exemplars with the input.More details can be found in Rais-Ghasem(1998).5.
ExperimentsThis section presents more examples of outputgenerated by the implemented prototype.
Theseexamples intend to underline different aspectsof the proposed model.5.1 Sense-View DevelopmentThis experiment provides another example ofsense-view development.
The destination sense-view, initially exemplified by only oneexemplar:Mary went to the office.This is how this sense-view looks like at thistime:\[Sense View\]Thematic Role: Destination - Marker(s): to-pp,IsKindOf-BUILDING(0.9)---->:IsKindOf-PLACE(0.81 )---->:IsKindOf-PHYSICAL-OBJECT(0.729)---->:MADE-OF(0.729)---->:MATERIAL,WEIGHT(0.729)---->:$1ZE(0.729)---->:IsKindOf-OBJECT(0.6561 )---->:IsKindOf-BUILDING-ARTIFACT(0.81 )---->:IsKindOf-ARTIFACT(0.729)---->:STATE -OF-MATTE R(0.729)---->: SeLl D,COLOR(0.729)---->:AGE(0.729)---->:OPERATE D-BY(O.729)---->:HUMAN,IsKindOf-INANIMATE(O.6561 )---->:Notice both IsKindOf-Building and IsKindOf-Place are relatively central to office andtherefore to this sense-view.
The above setshrinks rapidly after processing the next input:The student went to the stadium.SENSE Generated for Input Word Stadium\[Sense-Corcept(s)\] STADIUM\[Sense Viev, iThematic Role: Destination - Marker(s): to-pp,IsKindOf-BUILDING(0.8145)---->:IsKindOf-PLACE(0.73305)---->:IsKindOf-BUILDING-ARTIFACT(0.73305)--->:This trend continues with the following input,which leads to the following word sense:John went to the park.SENSE Generated for Input Word Park\[Sense-Concept(s)\] PARK\[Sense View\]Thematic Role: Destination - Marker(s): to-pp,IsKindOf-BUILDING(0.543)---->:IsKindOf-PLACE(0.7074)---->:Here, unlike previous case, IsKindOf-Place ismore prominent than IsKindOf-Building.
This isbecause park is not a building, but nonetheless,its effect is not enough to completely eliminateIsKindOf-Building from the sense-view.
Thenext input, however, strengthens IsKindOf-Building and weakens IsKindOf-Place, mainlybecause this property is not immediately presentfor auditorium.The musician went to the auditorium.SENSE Generated for Input Word Auditodum\[Sense-Concept(s)\] AUDITORIUM\[Sense View\]Thematic Role: Destination - Marker(s): to-pp,IsKindOf-BUILDING(0.571275)---->:IsKindOf-PLACE(0.53055)---->:5.2 Property Highlighting/BackgroundingThis experiment provides further evidence onhow a single concept in this model can beviewed from different perspectives.
Notice howthe generated output for book changes in each ofthe following cases.The book broke the window.SENSE Generated for Input Word Book\[Sense-Concept(s)\] BOOK\[Sense View\]Thematic Role: Instrument - No.

Here is theinput context:Mary reads physics.Because of its appearance in this context, MaD'(in fact, its corresponding concept, Female-Human) will be depicted as student.
In otherwords, through the assigned sense-view,properties specific to student (e.g., being asocial/academic role) will be associated withMary in this context.
The experiment alsoprovides another example of the system'slexical disambiguation ability (read isambiguous).
Here is the output word sense forMary.?

This experiment demonstrates thesystem's ability to handle such cases.
In thisexample, both readings of bank are compatible,to some degree, with the destination sense-view.John went to the bank.Here is the output word sense for bank, with twosense-concepts, both linked to the same sense-view.SENSE Generated for Input Word Bank\[Sense-Concept(s)\] RIVER-BANK, BANK-BRANCH\[Sense View\]Thematic Role: Destination - Marker(s): to-pp,IsKindOf-BUILDING(0.51585)---->:IsKindOf-PLACE(0.5967)---->:5.5 Instantiation of General TermsThis last experiment is inspired by theexperiment conducted by Anderson et al(1976).
These researchers found that shark wasa better cue than fish for subjects inremembering a sentence like the following:The fish attacked the man.They concluded thatfish was instantiated to, andencoded accordingly as, shark in the subjects'memory.Here is the word sense generated for fish inthe above context.
Notice how in the output, fishis associated with properties pecific to shark(aggressiveness and black color).SENSE Generated for Input Word Fish\[Sense-Concept(s)\] FISH\[Sense View\]Thematic Role: Agent - Marker(s): p-subj,COLOR(1 )---->:BLACK,AGGRESSIVE(1 )---->:IsKindOf-FIS H(0.9)---->:IsKindOf-VERTEBRATE(0.81 )---->:IsKindOf-ANIMAL(0.729)---->:GENDER(0.729)---->:IsKindOf-ANIMATE(0.6561)---->:-5.6 Unknown WordsFinally, here is an example of how sense-viewscan be used to establish some properties aboutunknown words.
Here is the input:Mary went to the palladium.The word palladium is not defined in thelexicon.
Nevertheless, the system associates itwith the proper sense-view.
Through this sense-view, some initial properties for palladium canbe inferred.SENSE Generated for Input Word Palladium\ [Sense-Concept (s ) \ ]  " "  unknown ?

ConclusionIn this paper, we discussed a lexicon model inwhich the role of context is not limited to senseselection.
Selected senses are further modulatedaccording to their surrounding context.
We alsodescribed the implementation f a prototype forsentential contexts.AcknowledgmentsSupport from NSERCacknowledged.is gratefullyReferencesAnderson, R., Pichert, J., Goetz, E., Schallert,D., Stevens, K., & Trollip, S. (1976)Instantiation of general terms.
