{laiys, rjwang, whsu}@itri.org.twAbstractThis paper presents an ongoing task that willconstruct a DAML+OIL-compliant ChineseLexical Ontology.
The ontology mainlycomprises three components: a hierarchicaltaxonomy consisting of a set of concepts anda set of relations describing the relationshipsamong the concepts, a set of lexical entriesassociated with the concepts and relations,and a set of axioms describing theconstraints on the ontology.
It currentlycontains 1,075 concepts, 65,961 lexicalentries associated with the concepts, 299relations among the concepts excluding thehypernym and hyponym relations, 27,004relations between the lexical entries and theconcepts, and 79,723 relations associatingthe lexical entries with the concepts.IntroductionThe Semantic Web relies heavily on formalontologies to structure data for comprehensiveand transportable machine understanding[Maedche and Staab 2001].
Therefore,constructing applicable ontologies influences thesuccess of Semantic Web largely.
An ontologymainly consists of a set of concepts and a set ofrelations that describe relationships among theconcepts.
An upper ontology is limited toconcepts that are abstract, generic, domain-broad,and articulate.
Cycorp constructed an upperontology ?
Upper Cyc?
Ontology.
It consists ofapproximately 3,000 terms, i.e.
concepts andrelations.
It has been used for organizing theupper structure of a knowledge base ?
the Cyc?KB.
A working group of IEEE (P1600.1) is alsotrying to standardize the specification of theupper ontology.
An upper ontology, called IEEESUO (Standard Upper Ontology), is expected toenable computers to utilize it for applications,such as natural language understanding andgeneration, information retrieval and extraction,Semantic Web services [McIlraith et al 2001],etc.
It is estimated to contain between 1,000 and2,500 terms plus roughly ten definitionalstatements for each term.This paper presents an ongoing task that willconstruct an upper-ontology-like ontology forChinese research and applications.
We refer to itas CLO (Chinese Lexical Ontology).
In additionto the structural portion, the CLO will containChinese lexicons associated with the conceptsand relations.
A pure ontology containingconcepts only (without lexicons) is abstract.
Alexicon-associated ontology makes thesubstantiation of abstract concepts easier.HowNet defines 65,961 Simplified Chineselexical entries by a set of predefined featuresincluding 6 categories of primary features and100 secondary features, and several symbols, inwhich the primary features are in a taxonomywith single inheritance.
The taxonomy isessentially regarded as the taxonomy of the CLO.However, the Chinese lexical entries defined inHowNet are simplified version.
They are notsuitable for Traditional Chinese research andapplications.
A traditional version of Chinesedictionary released by Sinica of R.O.C.
isfrequently used for Traditional Chinese NLP.
Bycombining the Traditional Chinese dictionaryand the HowNet, we attempt to construct theCLO and represent it in the semantic markuplanguage DAML+OIL since DAML+OIL iscurrently a basis of Web ontology language.The task of constructing the CLO can bedivided into three portions.
Firstly, a hierarchicaltaxonomy of concepts including relations amongthe concepts is required.
In our case, we utilizethe hierarchical primary features of HowNet toform the structure.
Secondly, a set of lexicalentries should be associated with the conceptsand relations.
Thirdly, a set of axioms thatdescribe additional constraints on the ontologyare required.
This paper addresses the ongoingconstruction task and a brief introduction ofWeb ontology languages.1 An Overview of Ontology and Its LanguagesThis section will describe the definition ofontology from different viewpoints and severalsemantic markup languages frequently used forrepresenting ontologies.1.1 What is Ontology?In WordNet, the word ?ontology?
has a sense of?the metaphysical study of the nature of beingand existence.?
The term has a long history inphilosophy.
It refers to the subject of existence.For AI community, it seems to generate a lot ofcontroversy.
One definition by Gruber (1993) isthat ?an ontology is an explicit specification of aconceptualisation.?
He considered that everyknowledge base, knowledge-based system, orknowledge-level agent is committed to someconceptualization explicitly or implicitly.
Theconceptualization includes the objects presumedor hypothesized to exist in the world and theirinterrelationships [Genesereth and Nilsson1987].According to Gruber?s definition, an ontologybasically consists of a set of concepts, i.e.
theso-called objects, which represent classes ofobjects, and a set of relations, i.e.
the so-calledinterrelationships, which are binary relationsdefined on concepts.
A special transitive relation?subClassOf?
represents a subsumption relationbetween concepts and structures a taxonomy.
Inaddition to the taxonomy, an ontology typicallycontains a set of inference rules.
The inferencerules enhance the ontology?s power in reasoning.Maedche and Staab (2001) proposed anontology-learning framework for the SemanticWeb.
In their case, they formally defined anontology as an 8-tuple < L , C , CH , R , RH ,F , G , A >, in which the first primitive Ldenotes a set of strings that describe lexicalentries for concepts and relations, the middle 6primitives structure the taxonomy of theontology, and the last primitive A  is a set ofaxioms that describe additional constraints onthe ontology.
Staab and Maedche (2001)considered that the axioms make implicit factsmore explicit.
The ontology is actually a lexicalontology since it comprises a set of lexicalentries.
We adopt the ontology?s definition forconstructing the CLO.1.2 Ontology Languages for the Semantic WebThe Semantic Web is not a separate Web but anextension of the current one, in whichinformation is given well-defined meaning,better enabling computers and people to work incooperation [Berners-Lee et al 2001].
The goalof developing the Semantic Web is to facilitatethe communications of people-to-machine,machine-to-people, and machine-to-machine.
Away to achieve this goal is to give theinformation the Web provided a well-definedmeaning.
Several markup languages aredeveloped for this purpose.
Fig.
1 shows thelayer language model for the Web [Fensel2000].HTML XMLXHTML RDFRDFSDAML+OILFig.
1 The layer language model for the Web.HTML is the most popular markup languagefor structuring documents.
Its simplicity enabledfast growth of the Web, but also resulted ininformation overload and that knowledge couldnot be shared conveniently and efficiently.
Anextensible metalanguage ?
XML was born forthis reason.
One of its instances ?
XHTMLredefined from HTML is more extensible thanHTML, but is still not powerful enough for theSemantic Web.RDF (Resource Description Framework)developed by the W3C (World Wide WebConsortium) is also an instance of XML.
It is afoundation of Web metadata processing andused for describing relationships betweenresources.
In general, any Web resource couldbe described in RDF.
The formal model for RDFcan be represented as triples: < predicate,subject, object>.
The instances of the model canbe also viewed as directed labeled graphs, whichresemble semantic networks [Quillian 1968].
Italso provides interoperability amongapplications, which enables applications toexchange and share machine-understandableinformation on the Web.RDFS stands for RDF Schema.
It is anextensible, object-oriented type system, which isintroduced as a layer on top of the basic RDFmodel [Brickley and Guha 2000].
RDFS can beviewed as a set of ontological modelingprimitives on top of RDF [Fensel 2000].
Forexample, two semantic modeling primitives?rdfs:Class?
and ?rdfs:subClassOf?
can beused for defining the taxonomy of an ontology.A semantic markup langauge ?
DAML+OIL,derived from RDF and RDFS, defines moreprimitives, such as daml:complementOf forcomplement relation, daml:sameClassAs forequivalence relation, etc., to represent morerelationships among resources.
DAML+OIL wasbuilt originally from the DAML ontologylanguage ?
DAML-ONT.
It combines manylanguage components of the OIL with the formalseamtics and reasoning services provided bydescription logic.
Summarily, compared to otherlanguages, such as XML DTD, XML Schema,and RDF(S), DAML+OIL possesses richerlanguage features, such as class expressions,defined classes, formal semantics, inference,local restrictions, and qualified constraints (seemore at www.daml.org/language/features.html).It is currently the basis of W3C?s Web ontologylanguage.
Therefore, we also follow thisspecification for the CLO.2 Construction of the Chinese Lexical OntologyAs mentioned above, the CLO mainly consistsof three components: a hierarchical taxonomy ofconcepts, a set of lexicons associated with theconcepts and relations, and a set of axioms.
Wedo not intend to explore the axioms in this paper.In the following, we will describe how toconstruct the hierarchical taxonomy and how toassociate lexicons with the concepts.2.1 Conversion of HowNetThe hierarchical taxonomy is actually aconversion of HowNet.
One of the importantportions of HowNet is the methodology ofdefining the lexical entries.
In HowNet, eachlexical entry is defined as a combination of oneor more primary features and a sequence ofsecondary features with prefixed symbols.
Theprimary features indicate the entry?s category,which are in a hierarchical taxonomy as shownin Fig.
2.
Based on the category, the secondaryfeatures make the entry?s sense more explicit,but they are non-taxonomic.
Some of thesecondary features are prefixed with symbols.The symbols describe the relationships amongthe lexical entry, the primary feature, and thesecondary features.entity|??thing|??phisical|??animate|??AnimalHuman|??human|?time|??space|??component|??Fig.
2 Taxonomy of partial primary features inHowNet.For example, HowNet defines the lexicalentry ???????
(stockbroker) as follows:(D.1) ?Human|?, #occupation|?
?, commercial|?, *buy|?, *sell|?, #fund|??
?The first term ?Human|??
is the so-calledprimary feature.
The remaining terms are theso-called secondary features, in which thesecondary feature ?buy|??
is prefixed with thesymbol ?*.?
It indicates that ???????
(stockbroker) can be an agent of ?buy|?.
?In the following, we will describe how toextract hierarchically structured concepts,relations among the concepts, and relationsbetween the lexical entries and the concepts, andhow to associate the lexical entries with theconcepts.Hierarchically Structured ConceptsTotally 1,521 primary features are divided into 6upper categories: Event, Entity, AttributeValue, Quantity, and Quantity Value.
Aftereliminating replica, we obtain 1,075 distinctprimary features.
These primary features arewell organized into a hierarchical taxonomy.Each primary feature can be viewed as a conceptfor an ontology.
By the taxonomy, we constructa fundamental ontology that consists of a set ofconcepts and a special relation ?
?subClassOf.
?The ?subClassOf?
relation realizes thehypernym and hyponym relationships among theconcepts.Relations among the ConceptsIn the two categories, Event and Entity, someprimary features have auxiliaries for describingthe relationships to other primary features.
Forexample, the primary feature ?human|??
hasauxiliaries: [!name|?
?, !wisdom|?
?, !ability|?
?, !occupation|?
?, *act|??].
It meansthat ?human|??
has attributes: ?name|??,??wisdom|??,?
?ability|??,?
?occupation|??,?
and can be an agent of ?act|??.?
For theCLO, these auxiliaries are used for constructingthe relations among the concepts.Relations between the Lexical Entries and theConceptsA noticeable thing is that, in HowNet, manyprimary features appear in the secondaryfeatures of many lexical entries to assistdescribing the senses of those lexical entries.That is, they play the roles of secondary features.For example, in (D.1), the fourth term ?buy|?
?is a secondary feature for the lexical entry ???????
(stockbroker).
And it is also a primaryfeature of the taxonomy.
In other words, thesesecondary features are concepts for the ontology.For each of them, its prefixed symbol provides arelation between the lexical entry and theconcept to which it corresponds.Associating the HowNet Lexical Entries withthe ConceptsAs mentioned before, a lexical entry in HowNetis defined as a combination of one or moreprimary features and a sequence of secondaryfeatures with prefixed symbols.
Its primaryfeatures being taxonomic indicate its category.And we took the taxonomy as the taxonomy ofthe CLO.
Therefore, each HowNet lexical entrycan be well associated with one or moreconcepts according to its primary features.2.2 Classification of the LexiconsFrom HowNet, we constructed the ontologytaxonomy and obtained Simplified Chineselexical entries.
It is still lack of TraditionalChinese lexical entries.
For the completeness ofCLO, we need a dictionary supportingTraditional Chinese.A Traditional Chinese dictionary compiled byAcademia Sinica of R.O.C.
(www.sinica.edu.tw)was released for computational processing ofChinese natural language.
It consists of 78,322words; each is associated with one or moreparts-of-speech (POS).
Taking into account thePOS, there are totally 80,491 lexical entries.
Thedictionary is an available and necessarycomplement to Traditional Chinese?s researchand applications.
We will refer to it as SinicaDictionary for short.Associating the lexical entries in SinicaDictionary with the concepts is equivalent toclassifying them into the ontology taxonomy.
Inorder to ensure the correctness of theclassification task, we proceed in asemi-automatic approach.

4 A diagram matching Sinica?s lexicalentries with HowNet?s.For each lexical entry in Sinica Dictionary,we search it in a pool of Big5-coded HowNetlexical entries, which are transformed from theHowNet originally encoded in GB code.
If it canbe found and its POS is the same as itscorresponding HowNet lexicl entry?s, then weassociate it with the concepts which the HowNetlexical entry belongs to.
There are totally 26,916completely matched entries.
The remainingSinica lexical entries contains 39,899 unmatchedentries and 13,676 incompletely matched entrieswhose characters are matched but POSs are notmatched.
(see Fig.
4)Observing the incompletely matched entries,in fact, all of them are multi-conceptual.
Toclassify each of them into the ontologytaxonomy according to its primary feature inHowNet is resonable.
For example, the lexicalentry ??????
(exciting) is classified into theadjective category in HowNet, but has a POS?VH11?
in Sinica Dictionary.
It is a verb in (S.1)and an adjective in (S.2).
(S.1) ???????????
(The movie excited everybody.
)(S.2) ??????????????
(I saw an exciting movie.
)Since the incompletely matched entries aremulti-conceptual, they must be classified intoother concepts.
Totally 53,575 lexical entries(unmatched and incompletely matched) shouldbe classified yet.
It is very hard to manuallyclassify such a large number of lexical entriesinto the large scale ontology consisting of 1,075concepts.
Therefore, an efficient approach is stillrequired.Traditional and Simplified Chinese languagesare originated from the same people.
Thelanguages should not be much different.
Anassumption is that most of the lexical entries inthe two unmatched groups, i.e.
regions (A) and(B) in Fig.
4, should be almost identical insemantics and syntax.
Under this assumption,we can produce a mapping table between thetwo groups of unmatched entries according totheir POSs.
Thus, we can shorten the time formanual classification.
This task, i.e.
thedash-blocked area in Fig.
3, is ongoing.Conclusion and Future WorkThe CLO currently contains 1,075 concepts,65,961 lexical entries associated with theconcepts, 299 relations among the conceptsexcluding the ?subClassOf?
relations, 27,004relations between the lexical entries and theconcepts, and 79,723 relations associating thelexical entries with the concepts.We are working toward the classification ofthe unmatched Tradictional Chinese lexicalentries into the CLO.
Besides, the relations arenot associated with lexical entries yet, thereforewe will research into this problem in the future.AcknowledgementsThis paper is a partial result of ProjectA311XS1211 conducted by ITRI undersponsorship of the Ministry of Economic Affairs,R.O.C.ReferencesBerners-Lee T., Hendler J. and Lassila O.
