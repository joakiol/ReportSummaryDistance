We con-sider the types of errors which arise in creating sucha lexicon, and how such errors can be measured andcontrolled.1 GoalThe goal of the (:omlex Syntax project is to create amoderately-broad-coverage lexicon recording the syn-tactic features of gnglist; words for purposes of cou>putational anguage analysis.
This dictionary is be-ing developed at New York University and is to hedistributed by the Linguistic Data Consortimn, to befreely usable for both research and commercial pur-poses by members of the Consortium.In order to ineet the needs of a wide range of an~>lyzers, we have inchlded a rich set of syntactic featuresand haw~ aimed to characterize these Datures in a rela-tively theory-neutral way.
In l)articnlar, the feature setis more detailed than those of the major commercialdictionaries, such ;us the Oxford Adwmced Learner'sDictionary (OALI)) \[d\] and the Longnum Dictionary ofContemporary English (LDOCE) \[8\], which haw~ I)eenwidely used as a source o\[' lexical i,,for,,lal, ioil ill \];lll-guage analyzers.

We currently use a Lisp-likeparenthesized list notation, although the lexicon couhlITo facilii~ate the transit ion to COMLEX by currenl, users ofthese dictionaries, we have i)reparcd mappings froln COMI,EXclasses to those of several other dictionaries.be readily mapped into other hwn,s, such as SC, MI,-marked text, if desired.SOllie sauil)le dicticl l ,ary entries are shown ilt F igure1.
The first syml/ol gives the part of speech; a wordwith several parts of speech will have several dictionaryentries, one for each part of speech.
Each e,itry has all:orth foati lre, g iv ing the base fO,'lfl of  ti le word, No,ins,verbs, and adjectiw~s with irregular Inorphology willliave featt,res for the irregular fo,.iris :plural, :past, :past-part, etc.
Words which take con-,i)leirients will havea subcatego,'ization (:sube) \['eat,ire.

or with justa ,lOll,, phrase comple i f ient  ( " \ [  aballdone(l the shill.
").Other syntactic features are recorded under :features.For example, the noun "abandon" is marked as (count-able :pval ("wlth")), indicating that it must appear inthe singular with a deter,niner unless it is preceded bythe preposZion "with".2.1 Subcategor i za t ionWe have paid p~u'ticular attention to providingdetailed subcategorization information (informationabout complement s ructure), both for verbs and fortllose nouns and adjectives which do take cmnl)lements.In order to insure the COml)leteness of our codes, westudied the codiug e)ul)loyed by s(weral other u,ajortexicous, includh,g (,he Ih'andeis Verh Lexlcolt 2, theA(JQIJII,EX Prc, ject \[10\], the NYU Linguistic Stringl'roject \[9\], the OALI), and IA)OCI'\], a, nd, wheneverfeasiMe, haw~ sought to incorporate distinctions madein any  of  these all(tie,tortes.

These features recorddilforences in grammatical functional structure as wellas constituent structure.

Tile constit.uentstructure lists the constituents in sequence; the gram-marital structure indicates the functional role playedby e,~ch c(mstituent.
The elemenl.s of the constitueutstructure are indexed, and these indices are referencedin the grammatical structure field (in up-.frames, I.heindex "1" in the grammatical structures always refersto tile surface subject of tile verb).Three verb frames are shown ill Figure 2.

We.
can divide thesources of error and inconsistency into four classes:1. errors of  class i f icat ion:  where an instance ofa word is improperly analyzed, and in particularwhere the words following a verb are not properlyidentified with regard to complement type.
SI)e-eific types of problems include misclassifying ad-juncts as arguments (or vice versa) and identifyingthe wrong control features.
Our primary defensesagainst such errors have been a steady refinementof tile feature deseril)tions in ollr nlanlla\] and rel';-ular grou I) review sessions with all the elves.
Illparticular, we have developed detailed criteria formaking adjunct/argument distinctiolis \[O\].A 1)reliminary study, conducted on examples(drawn at random from a corpus not used forour concordance) of verbs beginning with "j", in-dicated that elves were consistent 93% to 94%of the time in labeling argument/adjunct distinc-tions following our criteria and, in these eases,rarely disagreed on the subcategorization.
I  morethan half of the cases where there was disagree-then(, the elves separately flagged these as drill-cult, ambiguous, or figurative uses of the verbs(and therefore would probably not use them itsthe basis for assigning lexical features).
The agree-ment rate for examl)les whicti were not flagged was96% to 98%.2.
on i i t ted  features :  where an ell' omits a Daturebecause it is not suggested by an example in theconcordance, a citation ill the dictionary, or theelf's introspection.
In order to get an est.ilnate ofthe niag, itude of this problem we decided to es-tablish a measure of coverage or "recall" for thesubcategorization Dal.ures assigned by our elves.
"lb do this, we tagged the first 150 "j" verbs froma randomly selected corpus from a part of theSan Diego Mercury which was not inchlded inour concordance and then compared the dictio-nary entries created by our lexicographers againstthe tagged eorptis.

As you can see,the removal of the ILl)IlLs from consideration im-proves the in(lividual elf scores.The elf union score is the union, of the lexical en-tries for all fcmr elves.
These are certainly nuln-bets to be proud of, but realistically, having theverbs clone four sel)arate times is not I)ractical.llowew~r, in our original proposal we stated thatbecause of the complexity of the verb entries wewouhl like to have them done twice.
As can beseeil in l:igure 5, with two passes we su('ce,,d hiraising individual percentages in all cases.We would like to make clear that evell in timtwo cases where our individuM lexicographers miss18% and 13% of the complements, there was onlyone instance in which this might have resulted inthe inability to parse a sentence.
This was a miss-ing intransitNe.
Otherwise, the missed cOnll)le-rnents wouhl have been analyzed as adjuncts incethey were a combination of prepositional phrasesand adverbials with one case of a suhordinal.e ccm-j line(ion ~as".We endeavored to make a comparison withLDOCE on the measurement.
This was a bit dif-ficult since LDOCE lacks some con,plements wehave and combines others, not always consistently.For instance, our PP roughly corresponds to either1,9 (our P l ' /a l )V l ' )  or l)rep/adv + T1 (e.g.

Becauseof our desire Io obtain relatively complete foatllresets, even figr infrequent verl)s, we have pernfit-271ted elves to extrapolate from the citations fotmd.Such a process is bound to be less certain thanthe assignment of features from extant examples.Ilowever, this problem does not appear to be verysevere.
A review of tile "j" verb entries producedby all four elves indicates that the fraction of spu-rious entries ranges from 2% to 6%.d.
fl~zzy features:  feature assignment is defined interms of the acceptability of words in particularsyntactic frames.
Acceptability, however, is oftennot absolute but a matter of degree.
A verb mayoccur primarily with particular complements, butwill be "acceptable" with others.This problem is eompmmded by words which takeon particular features only in special contexts.Thus, we don't ordinarily think of "dead" as be-ing gradable (*"Fred is more dead than Mary.
"),but we do say "deader than a door nail".
It isalso compounded by our decision not to makesense distinctions initially.
For examl)le, manywords which are countable (require a determinerbefore the singular form) also have a generic sensein which the determiner is not required (*"Fredbought apple."
but "Apple is a wonderflfl fla-vor.").
For each such problematic feature we haveprepared gnidelines for the elves, but these stillrequire considerable discretion on their part.
'Fhese problems have emphasized for ns tbe impoftanee of developing a tagged corpus in conjunctionwith the dictionary, so that frequency of occurrenceof a feature (and frequency by text type) will be avail-able.
We have done stone preliminary tagging in par-aim with the completion of our initial dictionary.
Weexpect to start tagging in earnest in early summmer.Our plan is to begin by tagging verbs in the Browncorpus, in order to be able to correlate our taggingwith the word sense tagging being done by tim Word-Net group on the same corpus \[7\].
We expect to tagat least 25 instances of each verb.
If there are notenough occurrences in tim Brown Corlms , we will useexamples from the same sources as our extended cor-pus (s~e above).5 AcknowledgementsDesign and preparation of COMLEX Syntax has beensupported by tile Advanced Research Projects Agencythrough the Office of Naval Research under AwardsNo.
