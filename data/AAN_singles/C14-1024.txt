In this paper, we proposea novel hierarchical Bayesian model to integrate multiple social network structures and contentinformation for item recommendation.
The key idea is to formulate a joint optimization frame-work to learn latent user and item representations, with simultaneously learned social factorsand latent topic variables.
The main challenge is how to exploit the shared information amongmultiple social graphs in a probabilistic framework.
To tackle this challenge, we incorporatemultiple graphs probabilistic factorization with two alternatively designed combination strate-gies into collaborative topic regression (CTR).
Experimental results on real dataset demonstratethe effectiveness of our approach.1 IntroductionMany real-life data have representations in the form of multiple views (Liu et al., 2013).
For example,web pages usually consist of both text content and hyperlink information; images on the web haverelevant tags associated with their content.
In addition, it is also common that in real networks comprisingmultiple types of nodes are connected by multiple types of links, forming heterogeneous informationnetworks (HIN) (Huang et al., 2012).
For example, in scientific community, various types of links areformed for different types of objects, i.e., author writes paper, venue publishes paper, reader labels tag,and so on.
Therefore, with a large amount of complex network data available from multiple data sources,how to effectively combine this kind of rich structure with other auxiliary information such as contentinformation into the same recommendation framework is an interesting and significant research topicfor various recommender systems.
This paper aims to model multiple social graphs into a principledhierarchy Bayesian framework to improve recommending performance.The basic idea in this paper is inspired by multi-view learning approach (Liu et al., 2013), i.e., leverag-ing the redundancy and consistency among distinct views (Kumar et al., 2011) to strengthen the overallperformance.
We extend this idea (Liu et al., 2013) originally for clustering problem to deal with rat-ing scarcity problem when modeling user preference for recommendation.
Just as in general multi-viewlearning, each view of objective function is assumed to be capable of correctly classifying labeled exam-ples separately.
Then, they are smoothed with respect to similarity structures in all views.
Similarly, inthis paper, we assume that our individual views of multiple user social relations are similar and comple-mentary with a shared latent structure.However, different from multi-view clustering problem, our goal is to recover a sparse rating matrixwith a large number of missing user-item pairs rather than merely exploiting cluster structure with fulltask information.
Thus, the straightforward multi-view representation of the objective (rating matrix) is?Corresponding authorThis work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Instead, we use side information (user social graphs) to exploit multi-view learning forimproving collaborative filtering (CF).
As a result, collaborative topic regression (CTR) (Wang and Blei,2011) is employed as our basic learning framework with side information.
Recently, CTR has gainedconsiderable attention due to its well-defined mathematical framework and strong performance on userbehavior prediction for various real-world applications, such as document recommendation (Li et al.,2013), tag recommendation (Wang et al., 2013), music recommendation (Purushotham et al., 2012),celebrity recommendation (Ding et al., 2013) and vote prediction (Kang and Lerman, 2013).
However,all the extensions above merely focus on a single view of user or item relation.
In reality, a large amountof diverse social graphs data are widely existed and particularly valuable for mutually reinforcing eachother.
Therefore, it should be well considered.
Taking this into consideration, we extend CTR withmultiple social graphs factorization for recommender systems.The main challenge of incorporating multiple relations into CTR is how to exploit the shared infor-mation among multiple social networks and how to further deal with it to recover sparse rating matrix ina probabilistic framework.
Previous efforts, purely to address the first issue for clustering problem, areusually to seek a weak consensus (Liu et al., 2013) learnd from data jointly with clustering process.
Intu-itively, consensus can be seen as a latent cluster structure shared by different views.
Thus, it means thatlearning from different views should be softly regularized towards a common latent structure.
However,it is not easy to directly formulate it in a probabilistic framework, because weak consensus modeling cannot be separated from a joint higher task, i.e., recovering spare rating matrix, in our case.To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian model with multiple social graphsfactorization.
We exploit two ways of modeling shared information for multi-view based recommen-dation.
One is for heterogeneous network by directly modeling different view specific latent structureswith consensus for user representation.
The other is for homogeneous case, which can be used as a trans-formed version of heterogeneous relations.
In contrast with the first strategy, we model the latter usinga shared latent social structure for all views but with different user representations.
Thus, we can relaxstrong consensus assumption in our heterogeneous case, through linear combination of each sub-latentuser with maintained sharing mechanism.
The multiple graphs factorization process in the proposedmodel can be seen as a regularization approach on each latent user for better uncovering user-item latentstructures.
Although, regularization technique for modeling multiple heterogeneous networks is a hotresearch topic, in clustering study from an algebra view (Liu et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2011), not muchis known on using it for collaborative recommendation problems in a more complex probabilistic setting.The following sections will discuss those in details and we use the terms network and graph inter-changeably throughout this paper.2 PreliminariesIn this section, we briefly review collaborative topic regression (CTR) (Wang and Blei, 2011), as thefoundation of our proposed model.
Figure 1 (left) shows the graphical representation of CTR, whichcombines the merits of traditional collaborative filtering and probabilistic topic modeling.
Specifically,the key mechanism of CTR is that using topic vectors learned from LDA (Blei et al., 2003) jointlycontrols the prior distribution of latent items in original matrix factorization process of CF.
The generativeprocess is described as follows:?
For each user i,?
draw user latent vector ui?

?1uI), multivariate Gauss distribution with zero mean.?
For each item j,?

draw the response rij?
N(uTivj, c?1ij), univariate Gauss distribution, where cijis a confidenceparameter for rating rij, a > b. cij= a (higher confidence), if rij= 1, and cij= b, if rij= 0.However, CTR does not take the complex social network information, which is available and crucialin many real-world applications, into consideration.3 CTR-MGF: Collaborative Topic Regression with Multiple Graphs FactorizationIn this section, we discuss our proposed method, called CTR with multiple graphs factorization (CTR-MGF).
Our model is a generalized hierarchical Bayesian model which jointly learns latent user, item andmultiple latent social factor spaces.
Different from previous approaches, our method extends CTR tomultiple complex networks setting instead of one particular type of relation for user or item.
Moreover,we consider two real general contexts in various practical applications.
One is the context of hetero-geneous networks.
The other is the context of homogeneous networks.
It is noted that, for relativesimplicity, in this paper we only consider user oriented complex network.
The graphical representationof our models in Figure 1 (middle and right) takesK = 3 networks as illustration, which can be arbitraryin our derivation.
It is also easy to see that Purushotham et al.
(2012) is a special case of our proposedmodel, which is not equipped with graph sharing mechanism.3.1 Model NotationsEach social matrixQ corresponds to a social network structureG = {V,E}, where users and their socialrelations are represented as vertex set V and edge setE in network structureG, respectively.
The elementqimin Q denotes the binary relation between user ?i?
and graph specific feature ?m?
in heterogeneousnetwork or the relation between two users ?i?
and ?m?
in homogeneous network.3.2 CTR-MGF for Heterogeneous NetworksHeterogeneous network is formed by multiple types of nodes being connected by multiple types of links.The key characteristic of heterogeneous network is that the sizes of feature dimensions are differentamong multiple social graphs.
For example, in a social music sharing system such as LastFM, each userhas multiple heterogeneous relations associated with the interested music, i.e., user-artist, user-tag, andso on.
Our model can handle all these relations in the proposed framework, CTR-MGF.
Specifically, thegenerative process of CTR-MGF for heterogeneous networks is listed as follows:?
For each item j,?
draw topic proportions ?j?
Dirichlet(?

N(0, ?

N(uTivj, c?1ij).In the above generative process, the joint likelihood of data, i.e., R,Qk=1,...,K,W , and the latentfactors U, V, Sk=1,...,Kunder the full model is:p(R,U, V, Sk=1,...,K, Qk=1,...,K,W, ?|??

p(V |?V) ?K?kp(Qk|U, Sk, ?Qk) ?K?kp(Sk|?Sk)(1)For learning the parameters, we develop an EM-style algorithm similar to CTR.
In our model, findingthe MAP is equivalent to maximizing the following log likelihood obtained by substituting univariateand multivariate Gaussian pdfs in Eq.

The high confidence value a is set to the observed interactive pairs and the lowconfidence value b is set to the unobserved interactive pairs, where a > b > 0.236For our brevity, the remaining update rules for ?
and ?, can be obtained using the same way as de-scribed in CTR (Wang and Blei, 2011).
Please see that for details.It is worth noting that through our assumption and the derivation above, we have theoretically provedthat our modeling in this case is equivalent to first concatenating features of different views together andthen applying Purushotham et al.
(2012) for recommendation.3.3 CTR-MGF for Homogeneous NetworksIn this section, we further extend the basic CTR to the context of homogeneous networks.
In fact, anyuser specific homogeneous networks can be obtained through transforming corresponding heterogeneousnetworks.
For example, in LastFM, we can construct two user-user homogeneous networks by comput-ing the similarities of user-tag and user-artist from original heterogeneous networks.
The goal of thistransformation is to further exploit weak consensus modeling scheme based on Section 3.2.
Differentfrom the graph sharing mechanism presented in last section, we relax the restriction that all users havethe same representation.
Specifically, we assume each latent user has multiple sub-graph specific repre-sentations.However, it is nontrivial to model the relaxed assumption directly from original perspective.
To achievethis more weaker sharing mechanism, we are towards its transformed perspective, i.e., sacrificing hetero-geneous characteristic, because we need to exploit shared information from latent graph specific featureperspective.
Thus, we require equal dimensions of different graphs, which motivates us to investigate thehomogeneous case.The key differences between our model in this section and that in last section are the strategies oflatent user modeling and its social factor modeling.
More specifically, we model each latent user as alinear combination of all sub-latent users associated with multiple homogeneous networks.
All thesesub-latent homogeneous users are associated with a shared social factor feature space.
Thus, the sharedinformation among multiple graphs can be exploited and it is more flexible to adjust the contributionof each sub-latent user to the final latent user representation.
The generative process of CTR-MGF forhomogeneous networks is listed as follows:?
For each item j,?

N(?Kk=1Tkuki, ??1uiI).?
For each user-item pair (i, j),?

N(uTivj, c?1ij).In the above generative process, the joint likelihood of data, i.e.
R, Qk=1,...,Kand W , and the latentfactors U,Uk=1,...,K, V and S under the full model is:p(R,U, V, S, Uk=1,...,K, Qk=1,...,K,W, ?|??)

and ?, can be obtained using the same way as de-scribed in CTR (Wang and Blei, 2011).
Please see that for details.3.4 PredictionUsing the learned parameters above, we can make in-matrix and out-of-matrix predictions defined inWang and Blei (2011).
For in-matrix prediction, it refers to the case where those items have been ratedby at least one user in the system.
To compute predicted rating, we user?ij?
(u?i)Tv?j.
(12)For out-of-matrix prediction, it refers to the case where those items have never been rated by any user inthe system.
To compute predicted rating, we user?ij?
(u?i)T?
?j, (13)where the corresponding ?
?jis defined as topic proportion in Section 3.2 and 3.3.2383.5 Computational IssueTo reduce computational costs when updating ui, vjand other variables with similar structure in updaterule, we adopt the same strategy of matrix operation shown in Hu et al.
(2008).
Specifically, directlycomputing VTDciV and UTDcjU requires time O(L2J) and O(L2I) for each user and item, where Jand I are the total number of items and users respectively, L is the dimension of latent representationspace.
Instead, we rewrite UTDcjU = UT(Dcj?
bI)U + bUTU .
Then, bUTU can be pre-computedand Dcj?
bI has only Irnon-zeros elements, where Irrefers to the number of users who rated item jand empirically IrI .
For other similar structures, i.e., VTDciV , STDkqiS, and so on, they are similar.Therefore, we can significantly speed up computation by this sparsity property.4 Experiments4.1 DataWe evaluate our proposed method on real life dataset1from LastFm.
LastFm2is an online musiccatalogue, powered by social music discovery service for personalized recommendation.
This dataset(Cantador et al., 2011) is challenging.
Though it contains 92,834 pairs of observed ratings with 1892users and 17,632 items, the sparseness is quite low, i.e., merely 0.2783% , which is much lower thanthat of the well-known Movielens dataset with the sparseness 4.25%.
On average, each user has 44.21items in the play list, ranging from 0 to 50, and each item appears in 4.95 users libraries, ranging from 0to 611.
For each item, the tag information is used as bag-of-word representation.
After text processing,11,946 distinct words are remained in the corpus.
In addition, we further remove noisy users whichhave no items.
We also construct two additional social graphs for our experiments.
One is user-tagnetwork extracted from user-tag-item relations in original dataset.
The other is user-user network throughtransforming the constructed user-tag network.
The relation in all graphs is binary, i.e., the availabledenoted as 1 and the unavailable denoted as 0.Table 1: Original dataset descriptionDataset users items tags user-user relations user-tags-items user-items relationsLastFm 1892 17632 11946 25434 186479 928344.2 MetricsTwo metrics for evaluating the recommendation performance are employed, i.e., Recall and NDCG.Measure for plain relevance:Recall@k =]relevancek, (14)where ]relevance denotes the total relevant papers in returned top-k result.

in Section 3.2 and ?Our-Heter?
in Section 3.3can jointly provide a general and systematic solution to handling the following cases of using multiplegraphs for recommendation:?
Case 1:(Heterogeneous networks with noise) Network data or the extraction process is usuallyimprecise or noisy in practice.
Transform it into homogeneous case and then use ?Our-Homo?.1Data available at http://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/2http://www.last.fm/239?
Case 2:(Homogeneous networks) ?Our-Homo?
can be directly employed as the tool for case 1.?
Case 3:(Heterogeneous networks with high quality) ?Our-Heter?
might be directly employed.
It isnot needed to be further transformed into Homogeneous case.The detail experiments in the following sections are presented to justify the effectiveness of our methodsfor the three cases above.4.4 Experiments for Case 1 and Case 2In this section, we mainly focus on the most complex and common case 1 with case 2 in practice.4.4.1 BaselinesWe compare our proposed two models, the model in Section 3.2 denoted as Our-Heter and the model inSection 3.3 denoted as Our-Homo, with some state-of-the-art algorithms.?
CTR: This method, described in Wang and Blei (2011), combines both item content informationand user-item ratings for CF.?
PMF: This method, described in Salakhutdinov and Mnih (2007), is a well-known matrix factor-ization method for CF, only using interactive rating information.?
SMF-1: This method, described in Purushotham et al.
(2012), exploits single user?s social networkstructure combined with item?s content information for CF.
SMF-1 denotes using our extracteduser-tag relation.?
SMF-2: The same SMF method, described in (Purushotham et al., 2012).
SMF-2 denotes usingoriginal user-user relation.?
Our-Heter: Our model for heterogeneous networks, proposed in Section 3.2, uses our extracteduser-tag network and original user-user network.?
Our-Homo: Our model for homogeneous networks, proposed in Section 3.3, uses two homoge-neous networks, i.e., 1) the transformed user-user network through our extracted user-tag relation,and 2) original user-user network.4.4.2 SettingsFor a fair comparison, we use the similar settings as prior work in Purushotham et al.
(2012).
Specifically,to well judge the influence of multiple social network structures, we fix the effects of content informationto the same level that is optimal in SMF, ?v= 0.1.
We randomly split the dataset into two parts,training (90%) and test datasets (10%), with constraint that users in test dataset have more than halfof the average number of rated items, i.e., 20.
This expands the range of performance analysis forour evaluation compared with Purushotham et al.
(2012).
The optimal parameters are obtained on asmall held-out dataset.
For PMF, we set ?v= 100, ?u= 0.01.
For all CTR-based methods, we seta = 1, b = 0.01, ?v= 0.1.
Specifically, for CTR, we set ?u= 0.01.
For SMF-1 and SMF-2, we set?u= 0.01.
For Our-Homo, we set ?u= 0.01, ?u1= ?u2= ?s= 100, ?c= 0.01.
For Our-Heter, weset ?u= 0.01, ?s1= ?s2= 100.
The remaining paramters are varied for experiment analysis.It is noted that the task of out-of-matrix prediction is originally designed for evaluating item contentmodeling in CTR rather than user social graphs as in CTR-smf.
Thus, we followed the same setting inbaseline CTR-smf (Purushotham et al., 2012), not considering this task.4.4.3 Performance Comparison with State-of-the-Art MethodsFigure 2 shows the recall and NDCG results of all the methods when the number of latent factor is fixed to200 (optimal for the baselines).
The proposed model ?Our-Homo?
consistently outperforms the baselinesand ?Our-Heter?
model under both recall and NDCG measures.
This finding demonstrates that (1) usingmultiple graphs for CTR is a necessary for improving recommendation performance from both rankingand plain accuracy perspectives.
(2) strong consensus for modeling shared information undermines theperformance for multiple graphs factorization as designed in Our-Heter.
(3) For heterogeneous case, weaddress that through simply transforming the heterogeneous network to homogeneous one and then use240Figure 2: Our model comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, for Recall and NDCG.Figure 3: Performance comparison for different latent factors (K=200,300,400) @ top (50,100,200).?Our-Homo?.
This is natural but the opposite is hard.
Thus, our solution ?Our-Homo?
for modeling weakconsensus is effective for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases.In addition, we can see that CTR-smf (Purushotham et al., 2012) is sensitive to the quality of graph(SMF-1 with low quality and SMF-2 with high quality as shown in Figure 2).
In contrast, we can use thelow quality noisy graph (SMF-1) to improve the overall performance by this transformation process.
Infact, why Our-Heter does not perform well is mainly due to the noisy graph-1.
?Transformation?
can beseen as a ?denoising?
process.4.4.4 Performance Analysis with Different Latent FactorsFigure 3 shows the results of the compared algorithms, with different number of latent factors for variedtop recommended item.
It shows that K = 200 factors is optimal for all baselines compared with otherchoices of the number of latent factors.
This justifies our fire choice of 200 latent factors reported inFigure 3 (Other factor choices are omitted here due to page constraint, which is not optimal for ourbaselines) and suggests that the choice of latent factor number is crucial for all algorithms especiallyfor PMF.
In contrast, the proposed ?Our-Homo?
is more stable compared with PMF and outperforms theother baselines in an overall performance as reported in Figure 2.241Figure 4: Parameter analysis of graph selection for our weak consensus modeling, i.e., Our-Homo.4.4.5 Impact of the Parameter for Graph SelectionNext, we examine how our algorithm ?Our-Homo?
is influenced by the graph-selection weights.
In Figure4, the horizontal axis shows the graph proportion weight T1for graph-1 (user-tag network).
In our case,two social graphs are considered.
The weight for second graph is T2= 1 ?
T1, which is not shownin Figure 4.
Figure 4 clearly proves the effectiveness of our weak consensus modeling.
Specifically,we can see that 0.0 seemingly means that the first graph is not selected due to the weight of the firstgraph T1= 0.0 and that of second graph T2= 1 (fully selected).
However, due to our weak consensusmodeling scheme, though the graph-1 weight is 0.0, it does not mean that the first graph is removed.
Infact, the effect of graph-1 is also active through the shared variable ?s?
in Figure 1 (right).
This furthercan be investigated from the Equation 9.
Apparently, the case of 0.0 weight for graph-1, u is only relevantto u1, but from Equation 8, we can see that u1is also influenced by u2via the shared social graph factorss.
Thus, this also explains why 0.0 weight for graph-1 is not equal to the result of SMF-2 as shown inFigure 2, which only uses graph-2, original user-user graph in SMF-2.In addition, the ?valley?
in Figure 4 might be explained that in the extreme cases (0.0 and 1.0), thedenoising effect of weak consensus is slightly strengthened because only one specific graph (higherquality smf-2 or lower quality smf-1 shown in Fig.2) is directly associated with final latent user combinedwith shared variable.
Therefore, the extreme case (1.0) is towards a relative higher performance.4.5 Experiments for Case 3Though the proposed ?Our-Homo?
is more effective than CTR and CTR-smf, it does not mean that theproposed another method ?Our-Heter?
is useless.
In this section, we show how the case 3 will be justified.4.5.1 Baselines?
Our-Heter(N): Our model for heterogeneous networks, proposed in Section 3.2, uses our modifiedhigh quality user-tag network as described in Section 4.5.2 and original user-user social network asSMF-2 in Section 4.4.1.?
SMF-1(N): The same SMF method with single social network, described in Purushotham et al.(2012).
SMF-1 (N) denotes using our modified high quality user-tag network as described in Section4.5.2.?
Our-Homo(O): The result of this method is the same as that reported in Section 4.4.3.?
CTR(O): The result of this method (Wang and Blei, 2011) is the same as that reported in Section4.4.3.4.5.2 SettingsWe want to investigate whether Our-Heter will outperform Our-Homo in the case where the heteroge-neous networks with less noise are available, compared with previous results in Figure 2.
The settings242Figure 5: Our model comparison with the state-of-the-art methods (case 3), for Recall and NDCG.in case 3 are the same as that in Section 4.4.2 except for the refined user-tag graph.
In this case, we con-struct a less noisy user-tag network by selecting top-10% tags according to tf ?

The optimallatent factor number is set to 100 for Our-Heter (N) through a small held-out dataset.
The remainingparameters are kept as the same values in Section 4.4.2.

Specifically, for recall measure, Our-Heter (N) produces the best result with the increasing number of top recommended items.
In addition,we observe that modeling multiple graphs is necessary to further improve recommending performance,while multiple high quality heterogeneous graphs are available.For NDCG measure, Our-Heter (N) is comparable to our baselines.
Since recall measure is onlyconsidered for several reasons in previous work (Wang and Blei, 2011; Purushotham et al., 2012), ND-CG is introduced as a plus compared with primarily focused recall.
Therefore, Our-Heter (N) is alsocompetitive in overall performance in case 3.In fact, as discussed in Kang and Lerman (2013), CTR-smf (Purushotham et al., 2012) is not alwayssuperior to CTR (Wang and Blei, 2011) and vice versa due to different contexts.
Likewise, our model isunder the multi-view assumption as discussed in Section 1 that should be checked in practice.5 ConclusionsIn this paper, we propose a general recommendation framework with multiple data sources based onCTR.
It is a principled hierarchy Bayesian framework with multiple social graphs factorization for rec-ommender systems.
In this framework, two ways of consensus modeling are exploited.
Specifically,the proposed models Our-Homo and Our-Heter can jointly provide a general and systematic solution tohandling three real cases of using multiple graphs with item content information for recommendation:case 1) Heterogeneous networks with noise; case 2) Homogeneous networks; case 3) Heterogeneousnetworks with high quality.
Experimental results on real dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-proach.
While this framework is used for modeling multiple user social graphs, it can be easily extendedto exploiting other side information such as multiple complex relations for items in various applications.AcknowledgementsWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions.
