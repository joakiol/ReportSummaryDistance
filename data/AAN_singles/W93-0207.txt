Planning for Intentions with Rhetorical RelationsSusan M. HallerDepartment of Computer  ScienceState University of New York at Buffalohaller@cs.buffalo.eduA viable model of interactive discourse must explain how interlocutors share conversational con-trol to construct he discourse, and recognize the contributions of others to it.
The position thatI take in this paper is from a narrower perspective, one in which there is a primary speaker whocontrols and directs the discourse, but that does so while trying to accommodate he informationalneeds of someone who primarily listens, and who believes what the speaker has to say.
From thisperspective, I will argue that speakers realize their intentions by conveying rhetorical relations.With the primary speaker's intent understood, I maintain that the primary listener's contributionprompts the speaker to express his intent with rhetorical relations that satisfy the listener's infor-mational needs.
Both the intentions of the primary speaker, and the primary listener's feedbackare interpreted in the context of their shared beliefs about the domain, their shared beliefs aboutthe discourse that has been constructed so far, and their common, language-based knowledge ofpossible extensions to it.Researchers have argued for several years that communicative intent not only exists, its recog-nition by a listener is essential in order for communication to occur \[Aus62, Gri69, GS86\].
Morerecently, Mann and Thompson have proposed that the juxtaposition of propositional content com-municates one or more rhetorical relations \[MT87\].
Their theory, Rhetorical Structure Theory(RST), explains coherent ext structure in terms of a set of rhetorical relations that exist betweenunits of text.
The model that I use for planning discourse about domain plans in interactive set-tings was developed under the assumption that intentions and rhetorical relations exist, and thatthe relations that a speaker chooses to express are appropriate to conveying her underlying inten-tions \[Hal93\].
These assumptions are consistent with views that have been expressed by others\[Kib93, KK93, Lim93, Mai93, MP93, Tra93\].The following dialogue illustrates a relationship between intentions and rhetorical relations thatmy model captures:Jack:Jill:I'm going shopping at Wegman's (1)These checks must go in the mail today.
(2)There is a mailbox to the right as you go into Wegman's.
(3)Jill's remarks convey her intention to have Jack mail some letters, however her request is \[,ol,explicit in either line (2) or (3).
In addition to the assertional content of each sentence, when ,Jillfollows line (2) with line (3), she conveys to Jack that a relation holds between these pieces ofinformation.
This relation is that the information in line (3) allows the situation in line (2) to bedealt with effectively.
In terms of Mann and Thompson's rhetorical relations, the content of line (3)is enablement for line (2).
It is Jill's conveyance of this relation that communicates her intention,thereby making her request.
Furthermore, Jill believes that Jack knows how different rhetoricalrelations relate to discourse intentions.
This assumption is as basic as her assumption that Jackwill know the words that she uses.23Assuming that intentions are conveyed by expressing appropriate rhetorical relations, Mooreand Pollack note that RST becomes problematic IMP92\].
The RST relations fall into two classes.A presentational relation is used by a speaker to affect the mental attitude of the listener, and asubject-matter relation is used to inform the listener of the relation itselfi When analyzing text inwhich relations of both types apply, Mann and Thompson suggest hat only one is appropriate,which one that is, depends on whether conveying an intention, or conveying a relation is the essentialtext purpose.
Moore and Pollack argue against his view taking the position that a speaker alwaysstructures information in a discourse with an overarching intention in mind.
They note, for example,that a speaker may convey an object-attribute r lation with intentions at two levels: at the levelof information, the speaker intends for the listener to recognize the object-attribute r lationship,and at the level of communicative activity, the speaker intends for the listener to be able to carryout some plan.
Moore and Pollack refer to these levels as the informational nd intentional levelsrespectively, and they contend that a theory of discourse must account for this duality.In my system planning at the intentional level always precedes planning at the informationallevel.
I use a planning/acting system, the SNePS Actor \[KS91\] to formulate, represent, and executetext plans in an interactive nvironment.
The text plan that my system builds is about a domainplan that is under discussion.
In developing my model I have had to consider the relationshipbetween intentions and information from the perspective that the system is directing the discussion,and making its own intentions clear.
From this perspective, planning at the intentional evel isprimary, and can, and often does, lead to planning at the informational level.In my system, there are two kinds of text plans that correspond to the intentional and infor-mational levels that Moore and Pollack distinguish.
In response to a question, my system firstformulates goals and plans to influence the listener's mental attitude or abilities.
I have identifiedtwo intentions that are useful for planning text about plans.
First, with respect o the listener'smental attitude, my system plans text to try to have a listener adopt a domain plan.
Secondly,with respect o the listener's abilities, my system plans text so that a listener will be able to executea domain plan.
The initial text planning that my system performs is to try to achieve one of itsintentions, these text plans are called discourse plans.
The discourse plans in my system are basedo.
Searle's speech acts \[Sea69\], and Mann and Thompson's presentational rhetorical relations.The system's discourse plans can, and sometimes do, operate on their own.
This decisionis based on the observation that speakers can make utterances that convey an intention, but areotherwise content-free.
Direct speech acts like the simple request, "Close the door."
are productionsof this kind.
However, another way that speakers communicate their intentions is by expressingrhetorical relations.
For exampleIt's cold in here.
(4)Close the door.
(5)makes the same request as before, however, it conveys two additional pieces of information.
Onepiece is the assertional content of (4), and the second piece is that (5) is a solution to a problempresented in (4).
The second piece of information is a rhetorical relation that underscores therequest.
For this reason, in my system, discourse plans can expand out to include a second type oftext plan.
Content-selection plans correspond to subject-matter rhetorical relations.
These plansselect additional content for the discussion, but they do so only as part of a discourse plan.In my model, an assumption that underlies analysis of the user's feedback is that discourse plans,and their appropriate xpansions in terms of rhetorical relations are common knowledge.
Therefore,the system incorporates each of its plans into a single, overarching plan for the discourse.
Thisplan is represented in the system's knowledge base, and it is updated as the system continues toplan and interact.
When the system speaks, if the listener does not know the system's underlying24discourse intent beforehand, it is assumed that he will recognize it from the rhetorical relations thatare conveyed.
If the listener does know the system's intentions in advance, it is assumed that he willuse this knowledge to make sense of the system's contribution.
Therefore, my model is consistentwith the observations of others that understanding between the intentional and the informationallevel can flow in either direction \[GS86, MP92\].Following Carberry, I assume that when the listener knows the speaker's intention the listenerhas expectations for what will follow \[Car89\].
In my model, these expectations take the form of aset of rhetorical relations that are typically used to realize a given intention.
Motivated by Grice'scooperative principle and the maxims of Relevance and Quantity \[Gri75\], the system analyzesfeedback using its executed text plan as the discourse context.
I assume that the listener's vaguelyarticulated feedback addresses the system's intent, and that in the context of the system's discourseplan and what is mutually believed, it provides enough information for the system to decide howto expand its discourse plan.
This approach explains why the question "Why?"
is unambiguous inthe following interaction:Jack: Take the No.
4 train.
(6)Jill: Why?
(7)Jack: It will get you there fast.
(8)There are two types of mutual belief that the interlocutors use to coordinate this kind ofinteraction: shared beliefs and common knowledge.
First, let us assume that based on beliefs thatexist prior to this exchange, Jack and Jill share tile belief that Jill has a goal, for example, goingdowntown.
Secondly, Jack and Jill believe that, as language users, they possess common knowledgeof the preconditions on discourse plans for activities like advising and requesting.
Using both typesof knowledge, Jack can infer that Jill has interpreted his initial remark at line (6) as advice on howto pursue her goal, and not as a request for an act to achieve a goal that she may not know.
Thisinference is notwithstanding the fact that both speech acts can be realized with the utterance atline (6).To analyze Jill's response, Jack relies again on both their shared beliefs, and common knowledgeabout how discourse plans are realized in terms of rhetorical relations.
When Jill asks "Why?"
atline (7), Jack knows that advice can be meted out on its own, as Jack did in line (6), or it canbe realized with a rhetorical relation, preferably one that uses a clause that has already beenexpressed.
Since Jill knows this too, Jack concludes that her question is referring to the motivationthat typically augments requests and advice.
Therefore, Jack interprets Jill's why-question as aprompt to continue the discourse with this type of information.
This approach is supported by theobservation that Jack could have planned the advice with the motivation in the first place.
Lines(9) and (10) in the following example illustrate this:Jack: Take the No.
4 train.
(9)It will get you there fast.
(10)Jill: Why?
(11)Jack: It's an express.
(12)In this example, because Jack has already provided the motivation, Jill's why-question (line (11))asks a different question.
Since Jack knows his own intentions and how they are being expressed,and .because this knowledge is shared with Jill, Jack can infer that Jill's why-question is promptinghim for an appropriate xpansion of the motivation itself.
As noted by Moore and Pollack, toperform these kinds of inferences, a speaker needs to keep track of both her intentions and howthey are realized in terms of rhetorical relations.The following interaction presents more tangible evidence for the existence of rhetorical rela-tions, and demonstrates how they can be used to elicit information:25Jack: Take the No.
4 train.
(13)Jill: Why not the 1 or the 2?
(14)Jack: You could take one of those, (15)but the 4 is an express.
(16)Jill's question at line (14) essentially primes Jack with the rhetorical relation to use.
However,the rhetorical relation that she seeks is not an immediate, or perhaps typical, realization of theadvice.
Therefore, she must say enough for Jack to recognize the realization of his own intentionsthat she seeks.
Jill's feedback indicates that she wants Jack to include information about alternativetrains.
To accommodate Jill while still realizing his intentions, Jack uses a composition of rhetoricalrelations that incorporates this information.
In this case, Jack uses concession to include theinformation that taking other trains is feasible if not preferable.To summarize, the development of my model and its subsequent implementation has forcedme to consider two issues: the relationship between intentions and rhetorical relations, and howintentions and rhetorical relations interact with the speaker's and the listener's beliefs.
In theprocess I have identified two system-held intentions that are useful for discussions of plans: to havea listener adopt a plan, and to have a listener be able to execute a plan.\[Aus62\]\[Car89\]\[Gri69\]\[cri75\]\[GS86\]\[Hal93\]\[Kib93\]\[KK93\]\[I<S91\]\[Lim93\]\[Mai93\]\[MP92\]\[M P93\]\[MT87\]\[Sea69\]\[Tra93\]ReferencesJ.
