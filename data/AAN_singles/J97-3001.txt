A Rule-based Hyphenator for ModernGreekTheodora  I. Nouss ia  ?Computer Technology InstituteThe purpose of this paper is to formally examine hyphenation asit pertains to Modern Greek withthe aim of achieving accurate and thorough machine hyphenation.
Grammar rules are interpretedand formally expressed in terms of regular expressions of word substrings, and exact hyphenationrules are derived.
Vowel splitting, which traditionally is indicated in terms of prohibitive ratherthan explicit grammar rules, is examined in detail.
Many ambiguities caused by circular defini-tions of the prohibitive rule vowel sequences are detected, an overwhelming majority of which areresolved within the present framework.1.
IntroductionHyphenator programs in modern typesetting systems are necessary to eliminate x-cess space between adjacent words in texts.
Word hyphenation could be bypassed bystretching out this space, but this would effect the appearance of the document.
Ahyphenator program takes as input a word and returns the set of points within theword where hyphens are permissible.
Word hyphenation depends trictly on the targetnatural anguage, and many of the problems encountered are language specific.In general, machine hyphenation can be achieved either by consulting lists ofhyphenated words or by developing pattern-based hyphenation programs (Liang 1983;Knuth 1986).
The first approach ensures complete and correct hyphenation, but it hasthe disadvantage of being incapable of hyphenating words not on the list.
In particular,for highly inflectional languages, uch as Greek, these word lists would have to beextremely extensive in order to include all possible inflectional and derivational wordforms.
Even if such lists could be generated, it would be impossible to include wordssuch as compounds, which can be readily created, or all proper names.
In addition,the initial step toward the development of lists of hyphenated words is commonlyrule-based hyphenation.
On the other hand, although the second approach does notraise such problems, it has the disadvantage of being unable to guarantee completeand accurate hyphenation.The aim of the present study has been to analytically examine Modern Greekhyphenation i order to develop a pattern-based hyphenator.
The requirement specifi-cations are defined as follows: (i) to strictly prohibit impermissible hyphen generation;(ii) to generate a hyphen list that is as complete as possible.Existing hyphenator programs meet the first requirement either by decreasing thenumber of proposed hyphens or by establishing stop lists containing the appropriatelyhyphenated exceptional words.
Commonly, fulfilling the second requirement dependson the development of extensive subword patterns associated with hyphenation rules,as in Liang 1983, for example.
Establishing lists of exceptions has the same disadvan-tages as the approach to hyphenating through consulting lists of hyphenated words,* Computer Technology Institute, 3, Kolokotroni str., 26 223 Patras, Greece.
E-mail: noussia@cti.grQ 1997 Association for Computational LinguisticsComputational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3and thus hyphenator dependencies on lists of exceptions must be restricted as muchas possible.Native Greek speakers are able to hyphenate most Greek words fully and unam-biguously.
In extreme cases, they will propose two hyphen sets for the same word, onebeing a proper subset of the other, but both being acceptable.
However, complete au-tomatic hyphenation is a rather complex task.
Although consonant splitting is clearlydetermined by the grammar ules of Modern Greek and is thus easily expressed interms of non-exceptional formal patterns associated with specific hyphenation rules,vowel splitting is not.
The main problem of vowel splitting is that the grammar in-dicates the cases where splitting is not allowed, and the splitting of a large numberof these cases is ambiguous.
In addition, Greek vowels are sometimes accented, soambiguity resolution concerns thousands of vowel sequences.Existing hyphenator programs for Modern Greek are available as either commer-cial or research-based products and usually work on a minimal basis, i.e., finding onlyhyphenation points of consonant sequences.
Some research-based versions, includ-ing one application of the TEX (Knuth 1986) hyphenator for Greek, achieve improvedhyphenation but cover a minimal subset of the vowel sequences.The present paper will encapsulate he standard grammar hyphenation rules andthe general principles used in this study.
The paper expresses these rules (whichfocus mainly on consonant sequences) formally and points out their limitations interms of formal word expressions that can be completely and correctly hyphenated.The paper then turns to the problem of vowel splitting, and, by formally examiningprohibitive grammar ules, deduces general hyphenation rules.
It presents additionalheuristic rules discovered uring an exhaustive search of ambiguous vowel patterns,and demonstrates the degree of the resolved ambiguity in terms of the number ofvowel sequences that have been disambiguated.
Implementation issues are discussed,as well as the problem of words written in uppercase l tters.
Finally, the paper outlinesthe potential for generalization to other languages.2.
Hyphenation Rules2.1 Consonant SplittingAccording to KEME (1983) 1, the splitting of a Modern Greek word into syllables isgoverned by the following rules:C1.C2.C3.A single consonant between two vowels is hyphenated with thesucceeding vowel.A sequence of two consonants between two vowels is hyphenated withthe succeeding vowel, if a Greek word exists that begins with such aconsonant sequence.
Otherwise the sequence is split into two syllables.A sequence of three or more consonants between two vowels ishyphenated with the succeeding vowel, if a Greek word exists thatbegins with the sequence of the first two consonants.
Otherwise it splits;the first consonant being hyphenated with the preceding vowel.The output of a hyphenator program is a set of permissible hyphen points withinthe input word.
In order to specify this set, we shall proceed to a formal interpretation1 This book is the official grammar book of Modern Greek edited by a group of experts and it is arevised edition of Triantafillidis (1941, reprint with corrections 1978).362Noussia Hyphenator for Modem Greekof the grammar rules.
As can easily be observed, the grammar rules are pattern based.Thus, the input word is divided into substrings, and the corresponding rules areapplied to the substrings.
Specifically, the goal is to identify the regular expressionsof the patterns and the exact hyphen points for each formal pattern.
Ambiguity issuescaused by the interpretation f the grammar rules will be resolved.
We will also provethat rules C1-C3 are not sufficient to provide complete hyphenation coverage of Greekwords.
This study will be based on rules C1-C3 and, in addition, the informal definitionof a syllable as consisting of at least one or more vowels, or vowel(s) accompaniedwith one or more consonants (Triantafillidis 1978, 38), shall be adopted.Let V be the set of vowel characters, C the set of consonant characters, v E V, andc E C. Specifically, V = {~, ~, 7/, 5, 0, v, a;, d, G ~, E, 6, z~, ~3, ~', ~3, T, ~7}, C = {fl, % 6,~, 0, ~, A, #, ~, ~, 7r, p, or, T, ~, X, ?}.
Subscripts, e.g., Vl,V2, Cl, C2 are used in orderto distinguish more than one vowel or consonant of the same pattern.
The beginningor end of the input word is indicated by the symbol "o".
Optionality is indicated byplacing characters inside square brackets.
The operation obtaining one or more stringsis denoted by the symbol "+' .
The operation obtaining zero or more strings is denotedby "*', or Kleene star (Lewis and Papadimitriou 1981).We shall begin with the formal representation f the grammar rule subword pat-terns.
The substrings of rules C1, C2, and C3 constitute one or more consonants be-tween two vowels, or the strings of the expression vlc+v2.
Let cl be the first (obligatory)consonant in the consonant sequence of that expression.
Let c2 and c3 be the secondand the last (optional) consonants of the same sequence.
Thus, the expression can bewritten as VlCl\[C2C*Cg\]V2.
Therefore:Lemma 1The substrings of grammar rules C1, C2 and C3 are contained in the set of the expres-sion VlC 1 \[C2C*C3\]V 2.Grammar ules C1, C2, and C3 determine the hyphenation of word substringscomprising embedded consonants between vowels.
They do not apply to substringscontaining initial or final consonants.
According to the informal definition of syllablegiven above, a syllable has at least one vowel and thus the consonant prefixes andsuffixes of a word cannot constitute ntire syllables.
In other words, the maximalconsonant prefix of a word is always hyphenated with the following vowel and themaximal consonant suffix of a word is always hyphenated with the preceding vowel.The permissible hyphen points of words are located between the syllables, thus:Lemma 2(a) The point following the maximal consonant prefix of a word and (b) the point pre-ceding the maximal consonant suffix of a word do not constitute permissible hyphenpoints.The substrings of lemma 2(a) comprise the set of all maximal prefix and conso-nant sequences of words.
Formally, the set of expression 0C1\[C2C*C3\] is the set of allmaximal prefixes of consonants.
Respectively, c1\[c2c*c3\]e is the expression for the setof substrings of lemma 2(b).
Thus:Lemma 3The consonant substrings of Lemma 2(a) and 2(b) are contained in the sets of expres-sions ocl \[c2c*c3\] and C 1 \[C2C*C3\]e, respectively.363Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3Table 1Consonant patterns and hyphenation rules.

However, two dif-ferent interpretations can be given, namely that (i) only one hyphen point is specifiedby the rules, i.e., the point preceding or (exclusively) following the first embeddedconsonant Cl or that (ii) two additional hyphen points are permissible: those preced-ing the first and following the second vowel.
Both interpretations specify one commonpermissible hyphen point, which is, therefore, non-ambiguous.
To define this pointformally, let CC be the set of consonant sequences, two characters in length, that canbegin a Greek word.
(The exact definition 2of set CC is given in Table 1.
This set wasextracted by the extensive listing of the initial word syllables presented in Setatos\[1971\]).Theorem 1The strings of the expression VlCl \[C2C*C3\]V2 are hyphenated as Vl - Cl \[c2c*c3\]v2 if c1\[c2\] CCC U C. Otherwise they are hyphenated as VlCl - \[c2c*c3\]v2.ProofRule C1 indicates that the strings of expression VlClV2 are always hyphenated as Vl-CLV2.
These strings are a proper subset of VlCl \[c2c*c3\]v2 and they do not contain con-sonants C2C*C 3.
Thus, c1\[c2\] is degenerated to cl, while Cl c C by definition, and henceVlCl \[C2C*C3\]V2 are always hyphenated as vl - c1\[c2c*c3\]v2.The remaining strings are  VlClC2\[C*C3\]V2, and, as indicated by C2 and C3, theirhyphen point is the point preceding Cl if ClC 2 E CC or the point between Cl and c2otherwise.
\[\]2 Some books state that three consonant sequences, namely/~:r, vr, and "1'~ ( /b / ,  /d / ,  /g / )  are excludedfrom set CC under specific contexts, see for example, paragraph 81, note 4 of Trantafillidis (1941) andparagraphs 140, and 141 of Tsopanakis (1994).
The official grammar book (KEME 1983) however, doesnot treat these sequences as exceptional.364Noussia Hyphenator for Modem GreekTheorem 2The points immediately preceding Vl and immediately following v2 in the strings ofexpression VlCl\[C2C*Cg\]V2 do not necessarily constitute permissible hyphen points.ProofSuppose that grammar ules indicate that the points immediately preceding vl andimmediately following v2 are also permissible hyphen points.
By further taking intoaccount Theorem 1, the assumption is that VlCI\[C2C*Cg\]V2 is hyphenated either as - vl -CI\[C2C*C3\]V 2 - ,  or exclusively as - VlC 1 - \[c2c*c3\]v 2 -.A hyphen is not permitted at the beginning or the end of the word, thus thepossibility that the substring is located at the beginning or the end of the word is bydefinition excluded.
Consequently, there is at least one character preceding vl and onefollowing v2.
Consider the case where a consonant or consonant sequence precedes v2.If it is at the beginning of the word, according to Lemma 4(a) the hyphen cannot beinserted after the consonant(s) and hence the assumption ofa hyphen before vl is false.Respectively, for the case of a final consonant, orconsonant sequence after v2, accordingto Lemma 4(b) a hyphen following v2 is not permitted.
Now consider the case of a non-initial consonant or consonant sequence preceding vl.
In this case, Theorem 1specifiesone non-ambiguous hyphen point, which will not always be the point preceding vl;hence the assumption is again, false.
For the case of a nonfinal consonant sequencefollowing v2, the point implied by Theorem 1 may, in certain contexts, indicate thesame point as the assumption, but in other contexts it may not.
Nevertheless, in bothcases the correct point will always be specified, thus the assumed rule does not need tobe reapplied in order to indicate a potentially impermissible hyphen.
Cases of a vowelpreceding Vl or following v2 remain to be examined.
In these cases, Theorem 1 doesnot define additional hyphen points, and Lemma 4 does not indicate impermissiblehyphen points.
The issue to examine is vowel splitting independent of consonants.As we shall see in the following section, vowel splitting is not always permissible.To present he proof in its entirety, it would be sufficient o give two contradictoryexamples, where the points preceding Vl and following v2 are not permissible hyphenpoints, e.g., c~v-A~ \[av-hl 'courtyard', and :rc~ - A~& \[pa-li6s\] 'old'.Therefore, the assumption does not always hold.
\[\]A summarized formal definition of the hyphenation patterns and their associatedrules as discussed above is presented in Table 1.
Theorem 2 gives further support othe proposition that grammar rules are not capable of completely hyphenating all NLwords.Theorem 3Rules presented in Table 1 are sufficient to completely hyphenate all words containingno consecutive vowels.ProofEvery syllable has at least one vowel, thus a word cannot have syllables exceedingthe number of its vowels, and it cannot have fewer syllables than the number of non-ending maximal consonant sequences.
Let n be the number of vowels in a word notcontaining consecutive vowels.
Then, if the word begins with a consonant or consonantsequence the number of non-ending maximal consonant sequences i n, or otherwise,n -  1.
Consequently, allsuch words have exactly n syllables.
According to the definitionof a hyphen, these words have exactly n - 1 hyphen points.365Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3According to Theorems 1 and 2, for each substring VlCl\[C2C*C3\]V2, precisely onehyphen point can be derived.
All words containing n vowels, none of which arepairwise consecutive, have exactly n - 1 substrings of the expression VlCl\[C2G*GB\]V2,and according to Theorem 1, for each of these, one hyphen point can be derived.Therefore, for all words containing no consecutive vowels, precisely n - 1 hyphensare derived, and thus the rules of Table 1 are sufficient o completely hyphenate thesewords.
\[\]2.2.1 Elimination of consonant sequences and loanword hyphenation.
The examina-tion of consonant splitting has not set any restrictions on the maximum length or evenon the existence of certain consonant sequences.
The phthong sequences that ModernGreek permits are, however, restricted by principles of grammar that are assumed tobe universal.
In the case of consonants, these principles tate that the maximal conso-nant sequence is four characters long, and the maximal consonant prefix and suffix ofGreek words are three characters and one character long, respectively (Setatos 1971).If these principles had been used in the examination of consonant splitting, the set ofall subword patterns of Table I would have been restricted to the set of expressionVlC 1\[c2C3c4\]v 2.
Similarly, prefix and suffix consonant sequences would be restricted toOCl \[c2c3\] and c?, respectively.
Furthermore, restrictions of specific sequences not possiblein Greek words would further confine these patterns.
Loanwords ometimes challengethese principles.
Loanwords have been incorporated into Greek since ancient imes andinclude words that cannot easily be recognized as borrowed, because of their adap-tation into the above principles.
Other loanwords, most frequently words that endin more than one consonant, e.g., ~L,~# \[film\] 'film', have not completely adapted.
Asequence of more than three consonants at the beginning of the word is also possible,as in the word F~r,7o~r, cr~ \[gdansk\] 'Gdansk' (the city in Poland), although it is quiteinfrequent.
Cases of more than four consonants may also exist or might appear innew loanwords or, most likely, occur in artificial words such as tongue twisters.
Loan-word hyphenation is governed by the same grammar ules as the rest of the language.Thus, in order to cover hyphenation of such loanwords, the patterns of Table 1 mustnot be eliminated.
Apparently, this means that loanword hyphenation is independentof the rules governing hyphenation i the original language from which the word wasborrowed.
For example, although no hyphen point is derived by the Greek rules forthe loanwords 9~LA# \[film\] 'film', ~-~ \[tank\] 'tank', words having common deriva-tives of these, such as ~,kp6n~ \[filmdki\] 'small film' and "r&r,~ep \[t~nker\] 'tanker' arehyphenated as ~L&-#6-~c \[fil-md-ki\] and "rdr,-r~cp \[t~n-ker\].2.2 Vowel SplittingAs already discussed, the rules presented in Table 1 cover hyphenation of word sub-strings containing at least one consonant; cases of vowel splitting are not covered.Vowel splitting is quite common in Modern Greek and is usually handled in grammarbooks with prohibitive rules.
These are included within the context of the definitionof various vowel combinations, but are rarely explicitly included within the set ofstandard hyphenation rules.
3Before proceeding to the presentation and analysis of these rules, some terms thatwill be used need to be defined.
It should be noted that the terminology used refers to3 Vowel sequences are sometimes xplicitly mentioned inhyphenation rules, but usually only in thecontext of consonant sequences.
For example, all references to vowels in rules about splitting ofconsonants may be augmented with "(or diphthongs)."
This is not sufficient because vowel sequencesthat are not next to consonants may split, as in IIo~roM/-w-&~-vov \[papa-i-o-~in-nou\].366Noussia Hyphenator for Modern Greekthe orthographic representation f the various word substrings.
Phonetic transcriptionsare presented for the reader who is not familiar with Greek.
Although phonetics is theultimate basis for hyphenation, our approach is based on the available data, whichis the orthographic representation of words, and not a transcription in a phoneticalphabet such as IPA.As it has been previously defined, the term vowel refers to a single vowel orvowel character; V is the set of vowels.
Double-vowel blends are phonetically equiv-alent to vowels, and their orthographic representation comprises two vowel charac-ters.
Let 2V be the set of double-vowel blends, 2V = {a~, e~, oL, w, or, c~E, cE, oE, vi, o~;}({ \[c\], \[i\], \[i\], \[i\], \[u\], \[g\], \[E\], \[~q, \[ti\] }).
Some two-vowel orthographic combinations are pho-netically equivalent o a vowel-consonant sound.
Let VC be the set of such two-vowel combinations, VC = {c~v, cv, z/v, az~, ~,  z/~} ({ \[av\], levi, \[iv\], \[~v\], [~v\], [iv\] }).
Fi-nally, diphthongs and excessive diphthongs 4 are vowel sequences consisting of twoparts; each part can comprise either a vowel or a double-vowel blend.
Precisely, theset of diphthongs and excessive diphthongs i a proper subset of 0Clf2: f l , f2 E V U 2V}.The prohibitive hyphenation rules regarding vowel splitting are as follows:V1.
Double-vowel blends do not split.V2.
The combinations av, ev, z/v, a4, ~4, and Z/~ do not split.
5V3.
Diphthongs do not split.V4.
Excessive diphthongs do not split.All of the above rules are negative in that they indicate impermissible hyphen pointswithin particular substrings of consecutive vowels.
As the goal of the hyphenator is toidentify the permissible hyphen points, we interpret V1, V2, V3, and V4 complemen-tarily, i.e., in all other cases, splitting is allowed.
It is important to note that the ultimategoal is to specify the permissible hyphen points in any vowel sequence, and not onlyin the particular substrings of sequences mentioned in V1, V2, V3, and V4.
Formally,for every vowel sequence v0...  v,_\] of n vowels, and its corresponding set of pointsPvo...v,_, = {h i :  h i  is the point between vi and vi+l, 0 < i < n - 1}, the issue is to identifyset IPvo...v,_~ c_ Pvo...v,_1 of the impermissible hyphen points.
Then the set PPvo...v,._7 ofthe permissible points will be their set difference, or PPvo...v,++ = Pvo...v,_7 - IPvo...v,_+.Let us first formally specify the impermissible hyphen points in the particularsequences of V1-V4 rules.
The combinations contained in V1, V2, V3, and V4 aredistinguished in terms of their constituent elements.
All combinations are made up oftwo parts; both parts of double-vowel blends and combinations c~v, cv, etc.
of rule V2are vowels, while both parts of diphthongs and excessive diphthongs can be eithervowels or double-vowel blends.
Therefore, the impermissible hyphen point is locatedbetween the two parts in all combinations.
For double-vowel blends and the elementsof VC, which are digrams by definition, the impermissible hyphen point falls betweenits two constituent vowels, orIPvo~ c 2VuVC = {ho} = P~ov+ ~ 2vuvc hence PPvov+ c 2vuvc = ~.
(1)Therefore, no additional hyphen point is derived for any word where each vowelsequence is of either the 2V or the VC type.
Consequently, Theorem 3 is augmented4 Diphthongs and excessive diphthongs will be defined operationally in the next pages.5 The zlv combination is infrequently referred to in grammar books (KEME 1983), possibly because itappears in only a small number of words.
However, this combination is also considered, because suchwords are regularly used e.g., ~r/~pa \[efivra\] 'I invented'.367Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3to apply to words containing a maximum of two vowel substrings that are elementsof 2V or VC.Lemma 5The rules presented in Table 1 are sufficient o completely hyphenate all words inwhich each vowel sequence is included in set Vl Iv2\], such that Vl Iv2\] E V U 2V U VC.For words containing at least 'one n-gram vowel sequence, with n > 2, it is notapparent which vowel pairs, if any, will constitute a double-vowel blend or a VCso that the associated negative rules can be applied.
Furthermore, diphthongs andexcessive diphthongs comprised of either digrams consisting of two vowels, or tri-grams consisting of a vowel and a double-vowel blend, or tetragrams consisting oftwo double-vowel b ends, need to be precisely separated before the rules are applied.This procedure is called tokenization (see for example, Aho et al \[1986\]).
Tokenizationin this case takes as input a vowel sequence and returns a sequential list of maximalnon-overlapping tokens of the types 2V, VC and V. Tokens do not overlap in that everyvowel of the sequence is assigned to one and only one token.
Tokenization mightbe ambiguous in that it might generate alternative token lists for specific vowel se-quences.
More precisely, alternative token lists can be generated for sequences wherea vowel can be associated to its left or its right neighboring vowel in order to build upa 2V or VC token.
6However, tokenization is achieved unambiguously because vowelsare examined from left to right and a concrete token of the V type is extracted if itdoes not form a double-vowel blend or an element of the VC set with its subsequentvowel.
Otherwise, a token of 2V or VC type is extracted.
In conclusion, 2V and VCare disjoint, thus tokenization results in a unique list of tokens.Let any vowel sequence v0... Vn-1 of n vowels, and its k-token sequencer0...fk-1,k < n, fj c V U 2V U VC, 0 <_ j < k - 1, and let Pd0...f~-i = {hi I hj is the point between)~ and J)+l, 0 G j < k - 1}.
Let alo IPfo...fk_ ~ and PPfo...fk_~ be the sets of impermis-sible and permissible hyphen points of the token sequence, respectively.
Obviously,PPfo...fk-~ = PPvo...v,_~ and Pvo...v,-1 D Pfo...fk-~" According to (1), the elements of theirset difference Pvov,...v,_~ - Pfofl...fk-~ are all impermissible.
Thus, the points that remainto be examined in regard to their hyphen permissibility are elements of set Pfo...fk_,.This examination will be directed by V3 and V4 prohibitive rules.
To conclude, formaldefinitions of diphthong and excessive diphthong sets would suffice.
In this case, thespecification of permissible hyphens would be based on whether each sequence ofpairwise consecutive tokens is an element of one of these sets.Identification of diphthongs and excessive diphthongs i a difficult task becauseof the ambiguity that arises when attempting tomake specific designations.
There areextreme cases where sequences exist whose assignment as diphthongs i context de-pendent.
Some instances remain ambiguous even within precise contexts.
Specifically,they may or may not be labeled as diphthongs, depending on the specific dialect or onthe personal preference of the native speaker.
To deal with this problem formally weshall determine weaker boundaries of diphthongs and excessive diphthongs.
Whenconsidering hyphenation i regard to diphthongs, the problem is that diphthong def-initions are circular, as in Triantafillidis (1978, 33), who states that "two vowels 7that6 As a matter of fact, the only sequences that might be problematic in tokenization are in the set ofexpression {c~ I ~ I ~/ I o} {v I v} {5 I g}.
However, the algorithm ensures that the second vowel v orwill be associated with the first.
For example, the substring ov?

In the previous ection, vowel splitting was formallyexamined and concrete hyphenation rules were derived.
However, as Lemma 6(c)explicitly acknowledges, hyphenation is restricted by diphthongs and excessive diph-thongs.
In this section, we shall proceed to an empirical examination of diphthongsand excessive diphthongs.
Taking into account he initial specification that the hyphen-ator should never generate non-acceptable hyphens, and in order to pare down theenormous ets of candidate diphthongs and excessive diphthongs, we need to isolatethe subset of sequences for which splitting is always permitted.The approach followed was to first select all sequences of the above sets thatwere mentioned in various grammar books as examples of diphthongs and to assignthem to the category of "neversplitting sequences."
Then experimental matches wereconducted through an electronic dictionary of Modern Greek that encodes 100,000lemmata nd all their inflectional and derivational forms (Vagelatos et al 1995), anda 13 Mbyte corpus of newspaper articles.
By definition, this process could not be au-tomatic because hyphens were not included in the lexicon or the corpus, but therewere far too many matches to be examined manually.
Manual examination was re-stricted to those matches having limited frequency of occurrence.
Nevertheless, duringthis process, a systematic method of identifying additional nonsplitting sequences wasdiscovered based on a rule for stressing that states that a stress mark can only be ap-plied to the ultimate, penultimate, or antepenultimate position of a word.
Words inthe lexicon were hyphenated based on the assumption that all remaining candidatesdo split.
This hyphenation, however, resulted in certain words whose stress appearedon a syllable to the left of the antepenultimate position.
Apparently then, incorrecthyphenation had been applied.
All diphthong and excessive diphthong candidatesincluded in these words were collected and designated nonsplitting sequences.For the remaining candidates, identification of particular categories of substringswhere a general exclusion rule may apply was attempted.
Disparate and sometimescontradictory views given in various books (Setatos 1971; Triantafillidis 1978; Petrou-nias 1984; Mackridge 1987; Tsopanakis 1994) were collected.
Their integrity was ex-tensively examined through selection of matching words found in the corpus and in370Noussia Hyphenator for Modern Greekthe lexicon.
This empirical process resulted in formally expressed rules independentof any exceptions.
The sets of categories found are not necessarily disjoint, whereasall overlaps always lead to consistent hyphenation.
All categories found are explainedbelow, and representative hyphenated examples along with IPA transcriptions andtranslations are given.
In order to avoid confusion, hyphenation is applied to thosevowel sequences corresponding to the category currently being explained, and not tothe entire word.
Formal definitions of all categories are given in Table 2.1.
Examination of excessive diphthong candidates showed that 50% areimmediately eliminated, i.e., always split.
Specifically, rule F4 states thatcandidate xcessive diphthongs whose first part is stressed o alwayssplit, e.g., 7raL&E-c~ \[p~6i-a\] 'education', ~TopE-a \[istorf-a\] 'history',n~-~7~7/ \[~l-isi\] 'pregnancy', fl/c~o~ \[vf-eos\] 'violent', Ae~-o~ \[If-os\]'smooth', TpoE-a \[trf-a\] 'Troy'.
On the other hand, not all diphthongcandidates whose second part is stressed split, but the candidates in thisset that are not simultaneously excessive do always split (rule F5, Table2).2.
Another category is associated with the existence of the diaeresis markon a vowel of either a candidate diphthong or an excessive diphthong.All candidates whose second vowel has both a diaeresis mark and astress mark do always split, e.g., Ma-~ov \[Ma-fu\] 'May', 7rpo-?
:rap~l\[pro-fparksi\] 'preexistence', ~a-?Awcr~/\[eksa-flosi\] 'immateriality'.
Inaddition, all candidates having as first or second token a ?
always split,e.g., 6-?~o~ \[~-ilos\] 'immaterial', 7rpo-?rc6OecrT1 \[pro-ip6Oesi\] 'prerequistic',AaOpo?-aAovpv& \[la0roi-alurvia\] 'glass smuggling'.
As well, candidatesthat have as a first part only a nonstressed ~"always split.
Formally, thiscategory is defined by rules F6 and F7 (Table 2).
Diaeresis marks wereused as a discriminating factor for additional candidates.
Thesingle-stress ystem imposed on Modern Greek in the last decade, statesthat "if the absence of the diaeresis mark does not generate ambiguitythe mark should be eliminated" (Mackridge 1987, 93).
Theoretically, thissimplification could be applied to a variety of vowel sequences, butexamination shows that acceptable words containing such sequences donot always exist, and not all sequences split.
We focus on four thatalways split, namely: w~ - ~a; -~o \[zo-ffio\] 'vermin', 6v - 6-v~o?
\[~-ilos\]'incorporeal, immaterial', tv - apxt-wr~p~rTl?
\[arxi-ipir~tis\] 'butler', t?
-~rept-(;flpt?~l \[peri-fvrisi\] 'insult' (rule F8, Table 2).3.
Another observation is that all diphthong candidates having an ov or o?as a second part, and whose first part is not in set I always split, e.g.,nAai-ovaa \[klg-usa\] 'weeping willow', vra-o(;Ata \[da-tilia\] 'drums',#a-o(;vc~ \[ma-tina\] 'barge', wpcd-ov?
\[org-us\] 'beautiful'.
Furthermore, thecategory is expanded to include candidates whose second part is adouble-vowel blend.
At this point it should be stressed that there arespecific examples where the candidate vowel sequence couldlinguistically be considered a diphthong based on pronunciation(Triantafillidis 1978, 19).
However, during hyphenation they split defacto, e.g., ~rd-~L \[p~-i\] 'goes', c~-~L0c~A~?
\[a-i0alfs\] 'evergreen' (rule F9,Table 2).4.
Rule F~0 is associated with those candidate xcessive diphthongs thathave an ov or o?
as a first part.
Note that the stressed /u /has  been371Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3..already included in F4 because of the stress mark.
Detailed examinationof the candidates of this category led to the conclusion that thecandidates always split during hyphenation.
Although sometimes theyare pronounced as diphthongs, they are split de facto, e.g., q)eflpov-&pwg\[fevru-~irios\] 'February', flov-71~-6 \[vu-it6\] 'clamor', flov-E~cL \[vu-fzi\] 'itclamors', Be5ov-Evo?
\[vc6u-fnos\] 'Bedouin', Ov-a)~&~ \[u-alfa\] 'Wales',o~nov-o#eTp\[o~ \ aku-ometrfa\] ' coustic metrics'.An interesting subset of candidates concerns the intersection of candidatediphthong and excessive diphthong sets.
This set is (I U U) x (I tJ U) andalthough it comprises a relatively great number of elements, most ofthese have low frequency of occurrence in linguistically acceptablewords.
It should be noted here that some parts of this set have alreadybeen covered by other rules.
For the subset not covered, no general rulewas formulated but particular instances that always split were identified.These instances are covered by rule Fll.
We observed that some casespresent ambiguity, while others always split e.g., &-~a~-d#cuo~'\[Si-ist~imcnos\] 'contrary', &-~aTc~#~ \[6i-fstam~\] 'I dissent', &-zlO~#guo~\[6i-iOimgnos\] 'filtered', &-~preLpwT~n6g \[Si-ipirotik6s\] 'intercontinental',&-~O~la~l \[6i-f0isi\] 'filtering', &-~77/#c~ \[Si-fTima\] 'short story', #v-zl#guog\[mi-imdnos\] 'initiated', #v-~aeL?
\[mi-fsis\] 'initiate', 7ro~-~-z~g \[pi-itfs\]'poet', ~ro~-~ac~g \[pi-fsis\] 'you will do', o~w'o~v-c& \[aftofi-fs\] 'self-grown',CmTrAoTro~-?& \[cpiplopi-fs\] 'furniture-makers', c~,~-eg~ \[ali-fa\] 'fishing',w-& \[i-6s\] 'son', w-oO?ai~ \[i-o0?sfa\] 'adoption', 6p~rw-c~ \[~irpi-a\] 'harpy'.There is a different rule for determining the splitting of excessivediphthongs, referred to by both Triantafillidis (1978, 38) and Tsopanakis(1994, 108).
It concerns the natural semantics of excessive diphthongs;the avoidance of hiatus in the spoken language.
If the flow of speech isconstrained by the existence of additional "difficult" or complexphthongs, the pronunciation of the excessive diphthong in one syllablebecomes impossible.
One such case is that of at least a double-consonantsequence, whose second consonant is p \[r\] followed by a candidateexcessive diphthong.
That diphthong is not excessive and should alwaysbe split (rule F12, Table 2).It should be noted that additional rules covering additional vowel sequences underspecific contexts have been found and examined.
For example, candidate diphthongslocated between the members of compound words prefixed by a preposition do notsplit.
The automatic identification of these instances would be based on a morpholog-ical analysis of words, a process beyond the scope of the present analysis.2.2.2 El iminat ion of non-existent sequences.
Having completed the vowel splittingstudy, the question of whether all sequences presented in the rules of Table 2 existwithin acceptable Modern Greek words arises.
Eliminations of consonant patterns ex-ceeding a maximum length have already been discussed.
Eliminations based on theexistence of certain vowel sequences may be possible.
However, ancient Greek wordsand borrowed foreign words that are frequently used in both written and spoken formscontain additional sequences and, as has already been mentioned, their hyphenation isgoverned by the same rules.
Nevertheless, vowel sequences that contain consecutivestressed vowels or double-vowel blends, or consecutive vowels with diaeresis marksdo not exist in any word--pure Greek or loan--and thus this can be used as a general372Noussia Hyphenator for Modern Greekelimination principle.
The patterns flf2,fl,f2 C V U 2V U VC of Lemma 6 contain exactly301 such sequences.
From the remaining vowel sequences of Lemma 6, a few may beidentified as non-existent.
However, ad hoc compounds that can be readily createdmay contain even those sequences.
Mackridge (1987) notes that, unlike with English,a person fluent in Greek has no difficulty in pronouncing an unknown word.
Thisholds for all vowel sequences in Greek independently of whether they exist withinacceptable words.
It was thus decided to examine all theoretically possible cases andnot to eliminate a priori any sequences.2.3 Degree of Hyphenation CompletenessThe rules in Tables 1 and 2 guarantee 100% correct hyphenation.
The rules in Table 1are capable of locating all permissible hyphenations of consonant sequences.
In regardto vowel sequences, et (V U 2V U VC) has 34 elements and according to Lemma 6complete hyphenation of vowel sequences depends on 342 = 1,156 vowel sequences.Grammar ules V1 and V2 explicitly define 16 of these, namely the elements of sets2V and VC, while grammar books refer to 8 diphthongs that never split.
Hence, only16 + 8 = 24 sequences were initially non-ambiguous, while 1,156 - 24 = 1,132 wereambiguous.
Rules F1-F11 (Table 2) resolve the ambiguity of 1,015 different patterns.
(Occurrences of overlapping patterns have been eliminated by analytically calculat-ing the intersection of the sets of patterns for all pairs of rules F1-F11).
In general,1,156 - 24 - 1,015 = 117 remain ambiguous.
Thus, these rules are capable of com-pletely hyphenating at least (1,015 + 24/1,156)'100 = 89.9% of the 1,156 sequences.
(If non-existent patterns were eliminated, i.e., those consisting of either two consecu-tive stressed vowels or of two consecutive vowels with diaeresis marks, the degree ofcompleteness of the hyphenator on a vowel pattern basis could be then computed as:(1,029- 301)/(1,156- 301)'100 = 85.2%).
Taking into account rule F12, which resolvesambiguity by proposing additional hyphen points under specific contexts, the degreeof completeness increases.
Furthermore, the ambiguity of additional sequences can beresolved without proposing additional hyphens, by using the rule stating that stresscannot be applied to a syllable beyond the antepenultimate position.The degree of completeness calculated above does not represent completeness interms of hyphenated words of real text corpora.
The degree of complete hyphenatedwords of newspaper texts was manually calculated to be over 99%, as expected, be-cause the frequency of occurrence of the remaining ambiguous vowel sequences inwords of real texts is relatively low.3.
ImplementationIn the previous sections, hyphenation issues were examined as they pertain to Mod-ern Greek with the goal of achieving machine hyphenation that is both accurate andcomplete to the highest degree possible.Existing hyphenators for Greek are commercial products and usually work on aminimal basis, i.e., finding the hyphen points of consonant sequences and, in lim-ited cases, hyphens of vowel sequences.
A research-based version of the Greek TEXtypesetting system (Knuth 1986) provides improved hyphenation, but it only indi-cates splitting for 7.1% of the vowel sequences, which seem to have been selectedrather intuitively.
Furthermore, three of the sequences, as was observed, can generateimpermissible hyphens.The rules presented here have been used for the development of a hyphenatorprogram included in the Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 and 7.0 (Greek version) al-ready on the market.
The system has also been ported to different platforms including373Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3Lotus AmiPro and a specialized typesetting system of a major Greek newspaper.
Theformal rules and the exact definitions of the sets of vowel and consonant sequencescompiled in Tables 1 and 2 are sufficient to implement the hyphenator program.
Pat-terns in Table 2 constitute maximal vowel tokens, which can be derived by a lexicalanalysis process, while patterns in Table 1 consist of single vowels and consonants.The hyphenator program comprises two parts: the lexical analyzer and the actualhyphenator.
The lexical analyzer eads the input characters and produces as output asequence of maximal V, 2V and VC tokens, as well as tokens of the maximal consonantsequences of the word.
For all tokens, the absolute starting position of the token inthe input word is maintained, while the length of each token is implicitly defined bythe token itself.
All consonant tokens are also subdivided according to whether theirtwo character prefix is contained in the CC set or not.
Nontrivial consonant sequencesare also designated by a flag indicating the occurrence of a p \[r\] suffix.Vowel tokens are further classified according to the nearby resident vowel andconsonant tokens.
No additional classification of vowel tokens is needed in the fol-lowing cases: (i) vowel tokens not in the IUU set; (ii) vowel tokens that appear betweenany consonant sequences; (iii) stressed vowel tokens in the I U U set that have as a leftneighbor a consonant sequence with an / r /  suffix; (iv) vowel tokens that simultane-ously have stress and diaeresis marks.
The remaining vowel tokens are characterizedexplicitly as stressed I, nonstressed I, and U.The actual hyphenation phase follows, where the hyphenator t averses the tokensequence, identifies all ordered sequences of type (a) Ivowel token I - Iconsonant oken I- Ivowel token I, and (b) Ivowel token I - Ivowel token I, and applies the correspondinghyphenation rules.
The resulting hyphen points are given in terms of the absolutestarting position in the word of the first or the second token of the sequence currentlybeing examined.3.1 Hyphenation of Words in UppercaseThere is no one-to-one correspondence b tween uppercase and lowercase letters.
Themain difference is that stress markings are not applied to words whose letters are allwritten in capitals while the diaeresis mark is maintained in capital etters, u Conse-quently, the transformation f any uppercase word to lowercase and back to uppercaseagain loses no information.
The opposite transformation is not always without lossof information.
To decrease the complexity of the hyphenator, we used only lower-case patterns.
Thus, uppercase words are transformed to lowercase, hyphenated, andtransformed back to uppercase forms.
12Hyphenation patterns of consonant sequences (Table 1) are unchanged becauseconsonants do not take stress marks and, moreover, the vowels contained in thesepatterns are independent of stress.
On the other hand, many of the patterns derivedfor the hyphenation of vowel sequences cannot be applied to capitalized words be-cause the most important discriminating factor in diphthong identification is stressmarking, and uppercase l tters (Section 2.2.1) lack stress markings.
This observationcertainly implies the tendency for words in uppercase to have fewer hyphens thantheir lowercase quivalents.
This inconsistency annot be resolved without additionalinformation about the position of the stress mark.11 In words written with both capital and lowercase letters, an initial capital etter may have a stress mark.12 The tranformation takes into account he existence of a final \[s\] in the uppercase word and tranforms itto the final ~ instead of or, according to a corresponding transformation rule.374Noussia Hyphenator for Modern Greek4.
DiscussionOverall, it was feasible to make an analytical examination of the hyphenating sys-tem mainly because most of the known hyphenation properties were expressed orcould be expressed in terms of orthographic representation.
I  Greek, this representa-tion contains much of the pronunciation i formation, which is the ultimate basis forhyphenation i every language.
When analytical work reached the point where theavailable data could no longer provide the necessary pronunciation i formation, itwas replaced by empirical work.A similar process would be difficult to conceive in languages in which the or-thography and pronunciation are significantly different.
It should perhaps be statedthat the system itself may not have the capacity to be generalized to other languages.It is interesting to note that rules governing the splitting of subword patterns existin languages such as English, but their application is usually determined by ortho-graphically inexplicit information, such as the existence of a long, short, or stressedvowel in some position of the pattern.
Different ypes of properties typical of suchlanguages as English and German are based on morphological considerations thatwere not an issue for our system.
For example, in English "common roots" is an issuein hyphenation of compounds, whereas in Greek, it is not.
Such properties are notlikely to be similarly expressed in a pattern-based model.
The process of developing asimilarly performing hyphenator for such languages would be different.
Identificationof certain patterns would presumably be based on an empirical rather than an ana-lytical process.
Automatic extraction of common hyphenating properties from on-linehyphenated dictionaries i known (Liang 1983).
The resulting patterns tend to be moredetailed and extended.
Lists of exceptions seem to be obligatory in such an approachbecause their lack would lead to the generation of impermissible hyphens.5.
ConclusionsHyphenation issues pertaining to Modern Greek have been analyzed, and correct andthorough machine hyphenation has been achieved as a result of the present study.The explicit interpretation a d formal expression of specific grammar ules led to aformal hyphenation model, and further provided a means of expressing the model'slimitations.
These limitations were in turn examined through an empirical process,which also resulted in formally expressed rules.AcknowledgmentThe author is grateful to M.
