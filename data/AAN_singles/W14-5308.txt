A systemis described where users can find dialect or language-specific pronunciations of Afghan placenames inDari and Pashto.
We explore the efficacy of a phonetic speech recognition system employed in this task.1 IntroductionThe Audio Gazetteer hotspotting tool was developed by MITRE (2012) and employs the Nexidiaphonetic speech recognition engine (Gavalda and Schlueter, 2010) in several languages, including Dari(the Afghan variety of Persian) and Pashto, the two main languages of Afghanistan.
These languagesare both members of the Iranian language family and share a number of phonetic characteristics (Milleret al., 2013).
This tool enables a user to load audio clips and to search them for words contained withinthem using one of three methods: the Dari or Pashto alphabets, a Romanization scheme, or phonetics inSAMPA (Wells, 1997).
Such a search will yield each starting timepoint in an audio file where the systemhas identified the term being searched, along with a number between 0 and 100 indicating the level ofconfidence the system has in its determination.
While terms of any kind can be searched, the systemprovides additional mapping capabilities for placenames.Audio hotspotting, also known as keyword spotting or audio indexing, is a form of information re-trieval employing speech recognition that is used for quickly identifying passages of interest withinaudio files.
It can be used to identify calls of interest in call centers, or to explore reports of naturaldisasters or political crises in the media.
There are two main approaches to audio hotspotting; one in-volves speech-to-text (STT), also known as large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR),and the other employs phonetic speech recognition.STT ingests speech and outputs orthographic text.
To do this, it requires language-specific acousticand language models mediated by a pronunciation model or dictionary that maps words to phoneticforms.
The output text transcript can then be mined for terms of interest.
Raytheon?s BBN BroadcastMonitoring System is an example of such a system (Raytheon, 2012).
One liability of this approach isthe need to establish the vocabulary, upon which the language and pronunciation models depend, up-front.
That means that one cannot easily search for terms that have not been programmed into the systembeforehand.
This is an especially challenging impediment when confronting natural disasters and polit-ical crises in regions with towns and personalities whose names are ?out of vocabulary?
(OOV).Phonetic speech recognition uses language-specific acoustic models directly; allowing users to queryphonetic strings, possibly with the aid of a pronunciation model allowing orthographic search.
Theability to query phonetic strings removes the OOV problem; any string that can be composed of thephonemes of a particular language can be searched.
While this technology is useful for keyword spot-ting, it cannot be used to generate a meaningful orthographic transcript of speech, due to its lack of alanguage model.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

License details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/68Our purpose is to explore the feasibility of using phonetic speech recognition technology to exploresubtle dialect and language differences, with the ultimate aim of enabling language or dialect specificsearch.
In such a scenario, a user is not simply interested in finding a particular term of interest, he isalso interested in the sociolinguistic characteristics of the speaker of that term of interest.Various researchers have performed promising experiments using STT to explore phonetic variation.These experiments utilize STT in forced alignment mode; that is, given a pre-existing orthographic tran-script, they ask the recognizer to focus on deciding which pronunciation among a finite set supplied bythe researcher maps best onto particular audio exemplars.
Fox (2006) used this technique to examineseveral realizations of syllable-final /s/1 in Spanish including [s], [h] and deletion, while Wester et al.
(2001) explored variable deletion of /n/, /r/ and /t/ in Dutch, as well as schwa-insertion and deletion.Both demonstrated promising agreement between the STT-based approaches and human coding.In contrast, the phonetic speech recognizer employed here requires neither an orthographic transcript,nor a predetermined set of phonetic variants from which to choose.
For that reason, we felt it offered aflexible platform from which to explore phonetic variation, and thus enabled employing knowledge ofthat variation to perform dialect and language-specific search for Dari and Pashto.2 Data collection and transcriptionWe developed an interview protocol consisting of three components: a sociolinguistic background in-terview, a map task and a word list.
This interview was designed to elicit Afghan placename data fromAfghans residing in the United States whose native language was either Dari or Pashto.
Speakers bilin-gual in Dari and Pashto were interviewed in both languages sequentially.
Seven Dari and three Pashtointerviews, comprising approximately six hours in total, were digitally recorded and later downsampledto 16 MHz with 16-bit precision.The purpose of the sociolinguistic background interview was to establish the language and dialectprofile of each speaker.
Where possible, it was conducted in the speaker?s native language, and estab-lished the location and duration of each place where he or she resided.
In addition, the interview estab-lished the location and language of instruction of each school attended, as well as the language anddialect used with family members and friends.
The interview inquired about all the languages and dia-lects both spoken and understood by the speakers.The purpose of the map task was to gather subjects?
pronunciations of placenames in Afghanistan ina casual style.
A large colored map of Afghanistan, using native lettering, was placed before the subjectsand they were asked to explain in Dari or Pashto how to get to and from various points.The final part of the interview involved reading a word list in Dari or Pashto containing the names ofover 200 placenames, including provinces, provincial capitals, other large towns, administrative divi-sions, regions, mountain ranges, passes, bodies of water, airports and deserts.
In Pashto interviews, eachplacename was read both by itself for the direct case and in frames designed to elicit the oblique andablative cases.
As a result of the three-part interview, we obtained several tokens of many placenames,along a scale of more casual style in the sociolinguistic and map tasks to more formal in the word list.The placenames in each audio file were transcribed using Praat (Boersma, 2001).
Up to five of thefollowing transcription tiers were used:?
English: one spelling for each placename was used as an index for each utterance of a givenplace, regardless of any particularities in individual utterances.?
Native: Pashto or Dari spelling.?
Phonetic: fairly broad transcription in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).?
Language: Dari or Pashto.
In general, a given task was in one language at a time.
However,when working with bilingual subjects, they would occasionally explicitly remark on the pro-nunciation of the placename in the other language, so it was necessary to indicate the languagefor each placename.?
Case: for Pashto, indication of whether the particular utterance was in the direct, oblique orablative case.1 Square brackets [] are used for allophones or sequences when no particular phonemic claims are being made;slashes // are used for phonemes.69The purpose of the phonetic transcription was to represent a human phonetic judgment that could becompared to the hypotheses of the phonetic speech recognition engine.
In its documentation, Nexidiaprovides separate phoneme inventories in SAMPA for Dari and Pashto2.
Sometimes Nexidia does notprovide a symbol to express certain distinctions.
For example, a schwa [?]
is provided for Pashto, butnot Dari.
Schwa is a phoneme in Pashto; however, in Dari it is a possible allophone of some short vowels.In order to facilitate experimentation with the system, in the course of phonetic transcription of a givenlanguage, we limited ourselves to the speech recognizer?s phoneme inventory for that language.3 Placename pronunciation variationThe field of toponym resolution attempts to identify which particular place, or geocode, a given place-name refers to: for example, in some contexts ?London?
may refer to a place in England; in others, to aplace in Canada.
Research in this field has primarily focused on clues in surrounding text or audio todisambiguate such placenames (Leidner, 2007; Buscaldi, 2010).
To our knowledge, pronunciation var-iation in placenames has not yet been exploited to assist in disambiguation.Pronunciation of placenames is well known to vary; indeed one example of this is the phenomenonknown as ?local pronunciation?
(Forster, 1981).
Some common examples from the English-speakingworld include Cairo [kero], Illinois vs. Cairo [kajro], Egypt, and Houston [hawst?n] Street in New YorkCity vs. Houston [hjust?n], Texas.
The notion of local pronunciation is even more salient in a bilingualsociety; for example, French-speaking inhabitants of Montreal call their city [m?
?real], while English-speaking residents say [m?ntri?l], not to mention Americans, who might say [m?ntri?l].In Afghanistan, Pashto and Dari are the principal languages among many other languages spoken(Farhadi, 1955; MacKenzie, 1959).
Pashto and Dari-speaking communities are both located throughoutthe country, so it is very common for placenames to have Pashto and Dari variants, as well as variantsfor particular dialects of each language.Table 1 illustrates some variation within Dari pronunciation of placenames that we encountered.
Thisvariation is not limited to placenames; in fact, each of the phonetic phenomena has been reported byFarhadi (1955), and one variant of each word may be deemed formal and the other colloquial.Phenomenon Place Formal Colloquial/h/ dropping and com-pensatory lengtheningHerat????

Pashto has three cases, which may cause thepronunciation of placenames to vary.
The direct case is used by default, the oblique case is used when2 Nexidia Dari Guide 1.1, Nexidia Pashto Guide 1.070the placename is the object of certain prepositions and when the placename is the subject of transitivesentences in the past tense, and the ablative (also known as oblique II) is used in certain prepositionalconstructions meaning ?from?
(Penzl, 1955).
Not all placenames exhibit variation based on case.
Inter-estingly, the words that do feature a distinct oblique case take a plural ending.
One interview subjectsuggested that in that case, the word may be interpreted as a group of people or tribe.Place Direct Oblique AblativeKabul   ????

??[qala?
?naw] [kalaenaw]Table 4: Variation between Dari and PashtoAs can be seen in Table 4, the vowel systems of Dari and Pashto differ somewhat.
Dari generallyemploys a more rounded long a, which we can abstractly label /?/, compared to Pashto.
That is, Darioften uses /?/ in contrast to Pashto /?/.
The SAMPA provided by Nexidia for each language only containsone /?/ per language, so it is not possible to assess the system?s efficacy at recognizing the rounded orunrounded variant by searching within one language; however, a method involving crosslingual searchwill be discussed below.
In addition, future research will aim to measure the acoustic properties of thetwo varieties of /?/.With regard to consonants, Pashto has a retroflex /?/, while Dari does not.
In Kunar, the Pashto /?/corresponds to Dari /r/.
Note, however, that when speaking Pashto as a second language, Dari speakersreplace Pashto /?/ with /l/ more often than /r/ (Miran, 1969).
Dari preserves the Arabic voiceless uvularstop /q/, in contrast to Pashto, which generally employs /k/ in words derived from Arabic spelled withthe letter ?
(Penzl, 1955).4 Assessment techniquePrecision and recall are the most common measures for assessing quality in the context of audio hotspot-ting (Hu et al., 2012).
We employ these metrics in two scenarios: dialect-agnostic and dialect-specificsearch.
In the dialect-agnostic case, one would search for an orthographic term, for example LashkarGah, and calculate precision (true positives/(true positives + false positives)) based on how many of therecalled terms were in fact Lashkar Gah, and calculate recall (true positives/(true positives + false neg-atives)) based on how many of the actual Lashkar Gah?s in the file being searched were identified.
Thismethod provides a way of evaluating the efficacy of a given system to retrieve audio of interest whenone?s primary concern is the place or term in question, regardless of the pronunciation that was used.71We modify the scoring method in the dialect-specific case, in which we are focused on pronunciation.Consider for example, the two common pronunciations of Lashkar Gah in Pashto: [laxkarg?]
and[la?kar??].
In this case, when calculating precision, if one searches for [laxkarg?]
and [la?kar??]
is re-trieved, it is just as wrong as if Kabul were retrieved (variable scoring, by incorporation of approachessuch as Nerbonne and Heeringa (2010), will be considered in the future).
For calculating recall, theuniverse of Lashkar Gah?s is limited to those whose pronunciation matches the search term.There is some pronunciation variation that does not necessarily represent dialect variation, and shouldbe considered ?under the radar?
for the purposes of a dialect-specific search.
In the example above,either of the first two vowels could be [?]
instead of [a].
For this reason, we introduce the notion ofequivalence classes to enable us to give equal ?correct?
scores for example to both [laxkarg?]
and[l?xkar??]
when searching for [laxkarg?
].This scoring method provides a way of evaluating a given system?s sensitivity to pronunciation dif-ferences.
If a system proves adept at such a task, it can be employed in two related tasks:?
Language-specific search: find tokens of a given word uttered in a particular language?
Dialect-specific search: find tokens of a given word uttered in a particular dialect or accentThere is a large literature on language, speaker and dialect identification (Biadsy, 2011).
Most ofthese methods are designed to emit a judgment as to language, speaker or dialect, based on a given audiosample, which might be useful in various kinds of batch processing.
Another approach to accent andnativeness judgment is described by Weinberger and Kunath (2011).
In this approach, audio is firstreduced to a human-made phonetic transcription that is then mined for clues as to dialect and accent.The work described here may be situated between automatic techniques based on audio and post-hoctechniques focused on transcriptions.
Our method is designed for users interacting with a given audiosample; one that is likely to contain a mix of speakers, languages or dialects.
Also, in contrast to statis-tical approaches which may appear as a ?black box?
to end-users, our approach allows users to itera-tively and interactively develop hypotheses as to the association of specific pronunciations with lan-guages, dialects or speakers.5 Dialect SearchIn this section, we contrast performance on dialect-specific vs. dialect-agnostic searches.
Suppose inDari we are interested in finding speakers who use the pronunciation [qal?
?naw] instead of [qala?
?naw]for the town Qalah-ye Now ????
??.
In this case, we are focused on the application of the phonetic process/a?/ ?
[?].
The most salient aspect of this is the presence of the vowel [?]
rather than [a] in the secondsyllable.
Consequently, we are unconcerned about other forms of variation we may encounter, such asvariation between [q] and [k], and [?]
and [e].
We therefore contrast the following two equivalenceclasses for this experiment as shown in Table 5:No compensatory lengthening Compensatory lengthening[qala??naw][qala?enaw][kala??naw][kala?enaw][qal??naw][qal?enaw][kal?
?naw][kal?enaw]Table 5:  Equivalence classes for Qalah-ye Now ExperimentWhen we search for a ?no compensatory lengthening?
pronunciation, we have a correct answer whenwe retrieve any one of the ?no compensatory lengthening?
pronunciations, and equivalently for the?compensatory lengthening?
pronunciations.
Table 6 provides results for precision and recall on thissearch above two levels of phonetic recognizer confidence:72Search Term Confidence Precision Recall True Pos.

?naw], [qal?
?naw] is not retrieved above confidence 60.
However,when searching for [qal?
?naw], [qala?
?naw] is sometimes retrieved above that confidence level.
Thisasymmetric performance is reflected in the higher precision values for [qala?
?naw] as compared to [qal-?
?naw].Table 7 presents data for a dialect-agnostic search for Qalah-ye Now.
For this search, we are notconcerned about the particular pronunciation, so any pronunciation of the place in question will countas correct.
As can be seen, this perspective causes precision to increase for [qal?

(2012) and its efficacy as wellas algorithms for its implementation in the domain of placenames are discussed by Joshi et al.
(2008).We adduce crosslingual search as a tool for assessing language-specific search.
For example, if wesearch for Kabul using the Pashto engine, to what extent will we retrieve Pashto utterances of that placeas opposed to Dari utterances, and vice versa?
If the Pashto engine is good at picking up Pashto to theexclusion of Dari utterances of a placename, it may be an effective tool for language-specific search.73We performed a set of experiments to assess this capability.
First, we performed a search that wasagnostic with respect to language and dialect.
This means that in a search for Kabul in Pashto, we givecredit for both Pashto and Dari tokens of Kabul that are retrieved, regardless of their particular pronun-ciations.
Next, we performed language-specific searches in both Dari and Pashto.
When searching in agiven language, we only give credit for retrievals in that language.
Note that when we performed lan-guage-specific search, we were dialect-agnostic.
That is, we gave credit for a retrieval provided it wasin the language being searched for, regardless of the particular pronunciation used.The first term used for both language-agnostic and language-specific search was IPA [k?b?l].
Notethat due to details of the Nexidia engine, the actual SAMPA strings used were [k A: b O l] for Dari and[k A b u l] for Pashto.
The symbols for /?/ and /?/ in each language are arbitrarily different as indicatedin Table 10.
While IPA symbols (and their SAMPA equivalents) are theoretically absolute values inacoustic or articulatory space, in practice, they often adhere to arbitrary conventions for transcription ofa particular language.Language Orthographic symbol IPA SAMPADari ?

Thiscan be interpreted as follows: the Dari engine is more versatile and can pick up Pashto, whereas thePashto engine is more specific to Pashto and does not pick up Dari as well.7 ConclusionWe have achieved some success searching for language and dialect-specific pronunciations using theAudio Gazetteer tool.
A future challenge will be to identify dialect-specific toponyms automaticallyfrom a gazetteer.
Our results are encouraging for the exploitation of pronunciation variation in toponymresolution and perhaps speaker identification.
While dialect-specific results are often not as precise assearches that are agnostic as to language or dialect, in effect because we are ?raising the bar?
for what74is correct, more data and more dialect and language-specific phenomena need to be collected and pro-cessed through the system in order to establish its capabilities more clearly.ReferencesFadi Biadsy.
