Effec-tive syndromic surveillance is especiallyimportant if we are to successfully iden-tify and monitor disease outbreaks in theirearly stages.
This paper describes theconstruction and preliminary evaluationof a syndromic surveillance orientated ap-plication ontology designed to facilitatethe early identification of Influenza-Like-Illness syndrome from Emergency Roomclinical reports using natural languageprocessing.1 Introduction and MotivationIncreasing biosurveillance capacity is a publichealth priority in both the developed and devel-oping world, both for the early identification ofemerging diseases and for pinpointing epidemicoutbreaks (Chen et al, 2010).
The 2009 Mexicanflu outbreak provides an example of how an out-break of a new disease (in this case a new vari-ant of H1N1 influenza) can spend some weeksspreading in a community before it is recognizedas a threat by public health officials.Syndromic surveillance is vital if we are to de-tect outbreaks at an early stage (Henning, 2004;Wagner et al, 2006).
The United States Cen-ter for Disease Control (CDC) defines syndromicsurveillance as ?surveillance using health-relateddata that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficientprobability of a case or outbreak to warrant fur-ther public health response.
?1 That is, the focus of1www.webcitation.org/5pxhlyaxXsyndromic surveillance is the identification of dis-ease outbreaks before the traditional public healthapparatus of confirmatory laboratory testing andofficial diagnosis can be used.
Data sources forsyndromic surveillance have included, over thecounter pharmacy sales (Tsui et al, 2003), schoolabsenteeism records (Lombardo et al, 2003), callsto NHS Direct (a nurse led information and adviceservice in the United Kingdom) (Cooper, 2007),and search engine queries (Eysenbach, 2006).However, in this paper we concentrate on min-ing text based clinical records for outbreak data.Clinical interactions between health workers andpatients generate large amounts of textual data ?in the form of clinical reports, chief complaints,and so on ?
which provide an obvious source ofpre-diagnosis information.
In order to mine theinformation in these clinical reports we are facedwith two distinct problems:1.
How should we define a syndrome of inter-est?
That is, how are signs and symptomsmapped to syndromes?2.
Given that we have established such a setof mappings, how then do we map from thetext in our clinical reports to the signs andsymptoms that constitute a syndrome, giventhe high level of terminological variability inclinical reports.This paper presents an application ontology thatattempts to address both these issues for the do-main of Influenza-Like-Illness Syndrome (ILI).The case definition for ILI, as defined by theUnited States Center for Disease Control is ?fevergreater than or equal to 100 degrees Fahrenheit58and either cough or sore throat.
?2 In contrastto the CDC?s straightforward definition, the syn-drome is variously described as a cluster of symp-toms and findings, including fever and cold symp-toms, cough, nausea, vomiting, body aches andsore throat (Scholer, 2004).
In constructing an ap-plication specific syndrome definition for this on-tology, we used a data driven approach to definingILI, generating a list of terms through an analysisof Emergency Room reports.The remainder of the paper is divided into fiveparts.
First, we briefly describe related work, be-fore going on to report on the ontology develop-ment process.
We then set forth an evaluation ofthe ontology with respect to its coverage of termsin the target domain.
We go on to outline areas forfuture work, before finally presenting some con-cluding comments.2 Related WorkIn recent years there has been significant progressin interfacing lexical resources (in particularWordNet (Miller, 1995)) and upper level ontolo-gies (like the Descriptive Ontology for Linguisticand Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) (Gangemiet al, 2002) and the Suggested Upper Merged On-tology (SUMO) (Niles and Pease, 2003)).
How-ever, as our domain of interest employs a highlyspecialized terminology, the use of general lin-guistic resources like WordNet was inappropriate.Our work has focused on the representation ofILI relevant concepts that occur in clinical re-ports in order to facilitate syndromic surveillance.While the widely used medical taxonomies andnomenclatures (for example Unified Medical Lan-guage System3 and the Systematized Nomencla-ture of Medicine Clinical Terms4) contain manyof the ILI relevant concepts found in clinical texts,these general resources do not have the specific re-lations (and lexical information) relevant to syn-dromic surveillance from clinical reports.
Cur-rently, there are at least four major terminologicalresources available that focus on the public healthdomain: PHSkb, SSO, and the BioCaster Ontol-ogy.2www.webcitation.org/5q22KTcHx3www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/4www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/2.1 PHSkbThe Public Health Surveillance knowledge basePHSkb (Doyle et al, 2005) developed by the CDCis a coding system for the communication of no-tifiable disease5 findings for public health profes-sionals at the state and federal level in the UnitedStates.
There are however several difficulties inusing the PHSkb directly in an NLP orientatedsyndromic surveillance context:1.
Syndromic surveillance requires that syn-dromes and signs are adequately represented.The PHSkb emphasizes diagnosed diseases.That is, the PHSKb is focused on post diag-nosis reporting, when laboratory tests havebeen conducted and the presence of a diseaseis confirmed.
This approach is not suitablefor syndromic surveillance where we seek toidentify clusters of symptoms and signs be-fore a diagnosis.2.
PHSkb is no longer under active develop-ment.2.2 SSOThe Syndromic Surveillance Ontology (SSO)(Okhmatovskaia et al, 2009) was developed toaddress a pressing problem for system develop-ers and public health officials.
How can we inte-grate outbreak information when every site usesdifferent syndrome definitions?
For instance, ifState X defines sore throat as part of ILI, yet StateY does not, syndromic surveillance results fromeach state will not be directly comparable.
Whenwe apply this example to the wider national scene,with federal regional and provincial public healthagencies attempting to share data with each other,and international agencies, we can see the scale ofthe problem to be addressed.In order to manage this data sharing problem,a working group of eighteen researchers, repre-senting ten functional syndromic surveillance sys-tems in the United States (for example, BostonPublic Health Department and the US Depart-ment of Defense) convened to develop standard5A notifiable disease is a disease (or by extension, con-dition) that must, by law, be reported to the authorities formonitoring purposes.
In the United States, examples of noti-fiable diseases are: Shigellosis, Anthrax and HIV infection.59definitions for four syndromes of interest (respi-ratory, gastro-intestinal, constitutional and ILI)6and constructed an OWL ontology based on thesedefinitions.
While the SSO is a useful startingpoints, there are several reasons why ?
on its own?
it is insufficient for clinical report processing:1.
SSO is centered on chief complaints.
Chiefcomplaints (or ?presenting complaints?)
arephrases that briefly describe a patient?s pre-senting condition on first contact with a med-ical facility.
They usually describe symp-toms, refrain from diagnostic speculationand employ frequent abbreviations and mis-spellings (for example ?vom + naus?
for?vomiting and nausea?).
Clinical texts ?the focus of attention in this paper ?
arefull length documents, normally using cor-rect spellings (even if they are somewhat?telegraphic?
in style).
Furthermore, clini-cal reports frequently list physical findings(that is, physical signs elicited by the physi-cian, like, for instance reflex tests) which arenot present in symptom orientated chief com-plaints.2.
The range of syndromes represented in SSOis limited to four.
Although we are startingout with ILI, we have plans (and data) to ex-tend our resource to four new syndromes (seeSection 5 for details of further work).3.
The most distinctive feature of the SSO isthat the knowledge engineering process wasconducted in a face-to-face committee con-text.
Currently, there is no process in placeto extend the SSO to new syndromes, symp-toms or domains.2.3 BioCaster OntologyThe BioCaster application ontology was built tofacilitate text mining of news articles for diseaseoutbreaks in several different Pacific Rim lan-guages (including English, Japanese, Thai andVietnamese) (Collier et al, 2006).
However, the6A demonstration chief complaint classifier based onSSO is available at:http://onto-classifier.dbmi.pitt.edu/onto classify.htmlontology, as it stands, is not suitable for support-ing text mining clinical reports, for the followingreasons:1.
The BioCaster ontology concentrates on thetypes of concepts found in published newsoutlets for a general (that is, non medical)readership.
The level of conceptual granular-ity and degree of terminological sophistica-tion is not always directly applicable to thatfound in documents produced by health pro-fessionals.2.
The BioCaster ontology, while it does repre-sent syndromes (for example, constitutionaland hemorrhagic syndromes) and symptoms,does not represent physical findings, as theseare beyond its scope.In addition to the application ontologies de-scribed above, the Infectious Disease Ontologyprovides an Influenza component (and indeedwide coverage of many diseases relevant to syn-dromic surveillance).
In Section 5 we describeplans to link to other ontologies.3 Constructing the OntologyWork began with the identification of ILI termsfrom clinical reports by author JD (a board-certified infectious disease physician with thirtyyears experience of clinical practice) supported byan informatician [author MC].
The term identifi-cation process involved the project?s domain ex-pert reading multiple reports,7 searching throughappropriate textbooks, and utilizing professionalknowledge.
After a provisional list of ILI con-cepts had been identified, we compared our listto the list of ILI concepts generated by the SSOILI component (see Section 2.2) and attempted toreuse SSO concepts where possible.
The resultingILI concept list consisted of 40 clinical conceptstaken from SSO and 15 new concepts.
Clinicalconcepts were divided into three classes: Disease(15 concepts), Finding (21 concepts) and Symp-tom (19 concepts).
Figure 1 shows the clinical7De-identified (that is, anonymized) clinical reports wereobtained through partnership with the University of Pitts-burgh Medical Center.60concepts covered.
As part of our knowledge en-gineering effort, we identified concepts and as-sociated relations for several different syndromeswhich we plan to add to our ontology at a laterdate.8Early on in the project development process, wetook the decision to design our ontology in such away as to maintain consistency with the BioCasterontology.
We adopted the BioCaster ontology asa model for three reasons:1.
A considerable knowledge engineering efforthas been invested in BioCaster since 2006,and both the domain (biosurveillance) andapplication area (text mining) are congruentto our own.2.
The BioCaster ontology has proven utility inits domain (biosurveillance from news texts)for driving NLP systems.3.
We plan to import BioCaster terms and re-lations, and thus settled on a structure thatfacilitated this goal.The BioCaster ontology (inspired by the struc-ture of EuroWordNet9) uses root terms as interlin-gual pivots for the multiple languages representedin the ontology.10 One consequence of followingthis structure is that all clinical concepts are in-stances.11 Additionally, all specified relations arerelations between instances.Relations relevant to the syndromic surveil-lance domain generally were identified by ourphysician in conjunction with an informatician(MC).
Although some of these relations (likeis bioterrorismDisease) are less relevantto ILI syndrome, they were retained in order tomaintain consistency with planned future work.Additionally, we have added links to other ter-minological resources (for example, UMLS andSnomed-CT)8Note that finer granularity was used in the initial knowl-edge acquisition efforts (for example, we distinguished signfrom physical finding).9http://www.illc.uva.nl/EuroWordNet/10Note that we are using root term instead of the equivalentEuroWordNet term Inter Lingual Index.11Note that from a formal ontology perspective, conceptsare instantiated in text.
For example, ?Patient X presents withnausea and high fever?
instantiates the concepts nausea andhigh fever.Lexical resources and regular expressions area vital component of our project, as the ontologyhas been built with the public health audience inmind (in practice, state or city public health ITpersonnel).
These users have typically had lim-ited exposure to NLP pipelines, named entity rec-ognizers, and so on.
They require an (almost) ?offthe shelf?
product that can easily be plugged intoexisting systems for text analysis.The ontology currently includes 484 Englishkeywords and 453 English regular expression.The core classes and relations were developed inProtege-OWL, and the populated ontology is gen-erated from data stored in a spreadsheet (using aPerl script).
Version control was managed usingSubversion, and the ontology is available from apublic access Google code site.12 Figure 2 pro-vides a simplified example of relations for theclinical concept instance fever.4 EvaluationIn recent years, significant research effort hascentered on the evaluation of ontologies andontology-like lexical resources, with a smorgas-bord of techniques available (Zhu et al, 2009;Brank et al, 2005).
Yet no single evaluationmethod has achieved ?best practice?
status for allcontexts.
As our ontology is an application on-tology designed to facilitate NLP in a highly con-strained domain (that is, text analysis and infor-mation extraction from clinical reports) the notionof coverage is vital.
There are two distinct ques-tions here:1.
Can we map between the various textual in-stantiations of ILI concepts clinical reportsand our ontology concepts?
That is, arethe NLP resources available in the ontology(keywords, regular expressions) adequate forthe mapping task?2.
Do we have the right ILI concepts in our on-tology?
That is, do we adequately representall the ILI concepts that occur in clinical re-ports?Inspired by Grigonyte et al (2010), we at-tempted to address these two related issues using12http://code.google.com/p/ss-ontology61ClinicalConceptDiseaseSymptomFindingInstances:- athma- bronchiolitis- croup- ili- influenza- pertussis- pharyngitis- pneumonia- pneumonitis- reactiveAirways- respiratorySyncytialVirusInstances:- chill- conjunctivitis- coryza- cyanosis- dyspnea- elevatedTemperature- failureToThrive- fever- hemoptysis- infiltrate- lethargy- nasalObstruction- persistentNonProductiveCough- photophobia- rales- rhinorrhea- rigor- somnolent- throatSwelling- wheezingInstances:- anorexia- arthralgia- asthenia- bodyAche- coldSymptom- cough- diarrhea- fatigue- generalizedMuscleAche- headache- hoarseness- malaise- myalgia- nausea- painOnEyeMovement- productiveCough- soreThroat- substernalDiscomfortOrBurning- viralSymptomis_ais_ais_aFigure 1: Clinical concepts.techniques derived from terminology extractionand corpus linguistics.
Our method consisted ofassembling a corpus of twenty Emergency Roomclinical reports which had been flagged by ex-perts (not the current authors) as relevant to ILI.Note that these articles were not used in the initialknowledge engineering phase of the project.
Wethen identified the ?best?
twenty five terms fromthese clinical reports using two tools, Termine andKWExT.1.
Termine (Frantzi et al, 2000) is a term ex-traction tool hosted by Manchester Univer-sity?s National Centre for Text Mining whichcan be accessed via web services.13 It usesa method based on linguistic preprocessingand statistical methods.
We extracted 231terms from our twenty ILI documents (usingTermine?s default configuration).
Then weidentified the twenty-five highest ranked dis-ease, finding and symptom terms (that is, dis-carding terms like ?hospital visit?
and ?chiefcomplaint?).13www.nactem.ac.uk/software/termine/2.
KWExT (Keyword Extraction Tool) (Con-way, 2010) is a Linux based statistical key-word extraction tool.14 We used KWExTto extract 1536 unigrams, bigrams and tri-grams using the log-likelihood method (Dun-ning, 1993).
The log-likelihood method isdesigned to identify n-grams that occur withthe most frequency compared to some ref-erence corpus.
We used the FLOB cor-pus,15 a one million multi-genre corpus con-sisting of American English from the early1990s as our reference corpus.
We rankedall n-grams according to their statistical sig-nificance and then manually identified thetwenty-five highest ranked disease, findingand symptom terms.Term lists derived using the Termine andKWExT tools are presented in Tables 1 and 2 re-spectively.
For both tables, column two (?Term?

can map the term in col-umn two to the clinical concept in column three).For instance the extracted term slight crackles canbe mapped to the clinical concept RALE using thekeyword ?crackles.?
Note that ?-?
in column threeindicates that no mapping was possible.
Under-lined terms are those that should be mapped toconcepts in the ontology, but currently are not (ad-ditional concepts and keywords will be added inthe next iteration of the ontology).There are two ways that mappings can fail here(mirroring the two questions posed at the begin-ning of this section).
?Shortness of breath?
shouldmap to the concept DYSPNEA, but there is no key-word or regular expression that can bridge be-tween text and concept.
For the terms ?edema?and ?lymphadenopathy?
however, no suitable can-didate concept exists in the ontology.5 Further WorkWhile the current ontology covers only ILI, wehave firm plans to extend the current work alongseveral different dimensions:?
Developing new relations, to include model-ing DISEASE ?
SYMPTOM, and DISEASE?
FINDING relations (for example TONSIL-LITIS hasSymptom SORE THROAT).?
Extend the application ontology beyond ILIto several other syndromes of interest to thebiosurveillance community.
These include:?
Rash Syndrome?
Hemorrhagic Syndrome?
Botulic Syndrome?
Neurological Syndrome?
Currently, we have links to UMLS (and alsoSnomed-CT and BioCaster).
We intend toextend our coverage to the MeSH vocabu-lary (to facilitate mining PubMed) and alsothe Infectious Disease Ontology.63Term Concept1 abdominal pain -2 chest pain -3 urinary tract infection -4 sore throat SORE THROAT5 renal disease -6 runny nose CORYZA7 body ache MYALGIA8 respiratory distress PNEUMONIA9 neck stiffness -10 yellow sputum -11 mild dementia -12 copd -13 viral syndrome VIRAL SYN.14 influenza INFLUENZA15 febrile illness FEVER16 lung problem -17 atrial fibrillation -18 severe copd -19 mild cough COUGH20 asthmatic bronchitis BRONCHIOLITIS21 coronary disease -22 dry cough COUGH23 neck pain -24 bronchial pneumonia PNEUMONIA25 slight crackles RALETable 1: Terms generated using the Termine tool?
Currently evaluation strategies have concen-trated on coverage.
We plan to extend ourauditing to encompass both intrinsic evalu-ation (for example, have our relations eval-uated by external health professionals usingsome variant of the ?laddering?
technique(Bright et al, 2009)) and extrinsic evaluation(for example, plugging the application ontol-ogy into an NLP pipeline for Named EntityRecognition and evaluating its performancein comparison to other techniques).In addition to these ontology development andevaluation goals, we intend to use the ontology asa ?gold standard?
against which to evaluate au-tomatic term recognition and taxonomy construc-tion techniques for the syndromic surveillance do-main.
Further, we seek to integrate the resultingontology with the BioCaster ontology allowingthe potential for limited interlingual processing inpriority languages (in the United States, Spanish).Currently we are considering two ontology in-tegration strategies.
First, using the existing map-pings we have created between the ILI ontologyand BioCaster to access multi-lingual information(using OWL datatype properties).

the two on-tologies and creating object property relations be-tween them.For example (using strategy 1), we could movefrom the string ?flu?

Inturn, ili:influenza could be linked (usinga datatype property) to the BioCaster root termbiocaster:DISEASE 378 (which has the la-bel ?Influenza (Human).?)
From the BioCasterroot term, we can ?
for example ?
generate thetranslation ?Gripe (Humano)?
(Spanish).6 ConclusionThe ILI application ontology developed from theneed for knowledge resources for the text miningof clinical documents (specifically, EmergencyRoom clinical reports).
Our initial evaluation in-dicates that we have good coverage of our domain,although we plan to incrementally work on im-proving any gaps in coverage through a process ofactive and regular updating.
We have describedour future plans to extend the ontology to newsyndromes in order to provide a general commu-64nity resource to facilitate data sharing and inte-gration in the NLP based syndromic surveillancedomain.
Finally, we actively solicit feedback onthe design, scope and accuracy of the ontology.AcknowledgmentsThis project was partially funded by Grant Num-ber 3-R01-LM009427-02 (NLM) from the UnitedStates National Institute of Health.ReferencesBrank, J., Grobelnik, M., and Mladenic?, D.(2005).
