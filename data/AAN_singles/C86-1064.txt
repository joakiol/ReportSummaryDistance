Synergy  of ~ and _.mor_phology in automat ic  pars ingo f  F rench  language w i th  a min im .urn o f  dataFeasibility study of the methodJacques Vergne Pascale PagesInalco ParisWe intend to present in this paper a parsing method of Frenchlanguage whose particularities are: a multi-level approach: syntax andmorphology working simultaneously, the use of string pattern matchingand the absence of dlcUonary.
We want here to evaluate thefeasibility of the method rather than to present an operationnal system.I Genera l  eb iec t ives ;We intend to demonstrate that it is possible to parse texts with very fewdata: onlv determil2~.~j3_ts, indefinite and numeral adiectives, con!unction&o, ndr)reDositions, that in such an analysis, the consecutive application ofmorphology and syntax is insufficient, but that the use of .~YJ3.t?~ andm_gr~gy simultaneously is very efficient, end at last that the notion of agrammatical or lexical category of the word is not attached to the word, butdeoends on the local situation of the word in the senten~..~./I Commen_~_U.p~n objectives_:A.
Comparison with the classical parsing strategies:In nearly every contemporary automatic parsing system, we have achronology of several steps, one step by linguistic level: themoroholoeical steQ, then the .&yntactical ~;tep, and then eventually the semantic?zt_O..E. The morphological step uses an exhaustive dictionary of forms orsometimes of laminas.But we know that the human understanding uses simultaneous informationcoming from all levels.
Some parsers now begin to use two levelssimultaneously: for example the system ASCOF (SFB t00 Sarrebrt3ck, seereference) uses semantic information coming from semantic nets in thesyntactical analysis and semantic constraints in the syntactical rules.We propose to use morphology and syntax simultaneously in aparser with no dictionary.B.
Assumptions and theorlcal aspect:By "parsing" we mean to Lg..q.0_gj3j?~ adjectives and nouns with theirgender and number, verbs in the infinitive or in the present participle and theadverbs derived from adjectives, to E rg~ the lexicon of the text andto ~Lel.ez?\[\]/~ syntactical relations between words.The \[oossible al~Dfications of such a parser are: automatic indaxation, andalso as a first step in every system which uses a parser: inquiry system,automatic translation, filling knowledge bases from texts, etc .... particularlywhen the parser must work in open semantics.The main practical interests are to avoid consultino an exhaustiveIn the first step of the parsing and to Process the neolooismsexactly the same wav as the other words.
Dictionaries are expensive toand in fact are never completely updated; consulting a dictionaryproduces many artefact-ambiguities, locally to the word, which arecancelled as soon as the immediate context is examined; these ambiguitiesproduce a combination-explosion a d much redundant processing.There are also some theorical aspects.
If the Jg.EJ_q.~ category can bededuced with no dictionary, is this category really lexicel ?
We could rathername it a contextg..~ or ~ category or even a ~\[D_qJLOJ3.
: a wordgets its category from the flow of the text and the dictionary gives thecategories.
The ~ category then is only the reoularitv of the function.Further, any word can potentially h~we any category (perhaps more in Englishthan in French).
Claude Hag6ge: "co sent des ~.O~.tJg.~, non des parties cludiscours, qu'il convient d'abord de poser" (L'homme de paroles 1985 page137).
A more general theorical aspect lies in the use of computer as anexperimental tool which allows now to consider linguistics as anexperimental science and to use the experimental method to test linguistictheories.III The  mean_~:A, General method:The main method is pattern matching.
The principle is the following: theto recognize is compared to ~ set of pattorr,c, until a match is found.But what exactly is a .
~  in a natural anguage?The classical terms are "mg.E~&\[9.gJL" for the word, and "&VJ3.t6~" for thesentence.
We could say that morphology is the shape of the word and syntaxthe shape of the sentence; and more, we propose here to fill conceptually thegap between the level morphology-word and the level syntax-sentence:4- ~L.QLa2\[ =shape of the text.We can also remember that our habit of the ~Lrj_U,9..D. word properlydelimited by spaces er punctuation rnakes us forget that the ~ string is acontinuum that we cut while understanding: we use simultaneouslymorphological, syntactical, semantic and pragmatical information with whichwe make deductions, inferences, deadlocks and use intuition (about the wordsee Tesni6re page 27, ?
11 to 15).It is possible to classify the pattern matching methods in two categories:the statistic and the structural methods (see Miclet and Fu).
Moreprecisely, we use here a string pattern matching method: every word ofthe sentence is replaced by its category, coded by a character, and questionmarks for unknown words:r#lectricit6 c6r#brale --> d??
(d=determiner) <the cerebral electricity>maladies mentales et l#sions c#r#brales --> ??c??
(c=coordination)<mental i lnesses and cerebral esions>Let us call this string the pattern by word that will be used in thegrammar and in the parsing,The information used in the parsing is composed of three types of data: a~,LELe_~J.
?~ of the words in finite number (about ~_0JLoJLn~), morphologicaldeduction rules for each word, a set of eatterns of the noun phrase for patternmatching, and of course thetexHo ana!vse itself.The 1irst steo of this st.u._d.?
is :lhe noun or ereoositional #hre~g.
Thefollowing steps are the recognition of these phrases in the sentence, and thewhole parsing of the sentence.This work is implemented on Apple Macintosh, and the programminglanguage is Pascal UCSD which is suitable to develop such a parser whosealgorithms are rarely recursive.B.
The small lexicon:It contains about 80 forms (not lemmas): determiners (articles,possessive, demontrative and indefinite adjectives), prepositions,coordinations, ome punctuation signs (considered as words).
These words arethe .a_EqbPE~g..D._qJ.O~ for pattern matching.269But we realize that it is impossible to keep the general position to haveonly the words in finite number in this lexicon, and that the problem becomespragmatic: what is the minimum of data necessary to recognize correctly theother words ?
We have added the first numeral adjectives, indefiniteadjectives, some very current adjectives often placed before the noun (petit,autre, m~me ), adverb not derived from adjective (bien, real, tr~s ).Every form has its possible categories, eventually gender and number; thelist of the possible categories can be open: a form can have another categoryin a particular sentence: le blen et le real, le la de ma clarinette .For example, et can be:- conjunction which coordinates adjectives (b):valour Iocalisatrice etpronostique --> ??b?
<localizing and prognosal value>- conjunction which coordinates noun phrases (c):maladies mentales et lSsions c~rSbralas --> ??o?
?<mental illnesses and cerebral lesions>- conjunction which coordinates nouns (e):crSation et renouvellement lexicaux -->?a??
<lexical creation and renewing>- conjunction which coordinates prepositional phrases (C):I'influence de I'inductance at de la capacit6 --> d?pd?Opd?<the influence of inductance and capacity>We have distinguished two categories of preposition according to the"attraction" between the two np: high altraction: le syst~me d'unit~s <theunit system> (sort of compound nouns), or low attraction: un chat sur un toit<a cat on a roof> (facultative "circumstant"), whence two kinds ofprepositional phrases: \ [E \ [~ to the np : dl de en (o) or #.~\[fim~ to thenp: ,~ de en sur clans chez vers (p),So de can be:- internal preposition (o) in:une th#orie de la morphog#n#se --> d?od?
<a morphogenasis theory>le syst#me d' unit#s internationnal -->d?o??
<the international unit system>- external preposition (p) in:de ranimal & rhomme --> pd?pd?
<fromanimaltohuman>- preposition (q) in:Ins diff#rents moyens de faire lea mesures --> d?
?qid?<the different ways to make measures>C.
The morpho log ica l  approach:Our attitude is to explore all possibilities to extract, to deduceIn fo rmat ion  f rom the  mere  morpho logy  o f  the  word ,  w i thoutd ic t ionar ies ,  information which can be used ~t ~,NV time of the s ~For example, lot us observe the words ending with -Ire) : -icltd -ivit6-abi/It6 -ibillt6 -ubi/It(~ -arlt6 -a/lt~ ; we have a regularalternation adjective/noun: ~lectr" ~lg.~ / 6/ectrj?jJ~, combatjl / combatjyj.~,portb#L~_ /portb#~_t~, particu/j.~ /particu/arit~ ; from these endings, wecan deduce that the word means a quality (semantic aspect) and is a singularfeminine noun (category).On the semantic opposite, endings as -ification, -isation suggest anaction, for example: class'Ej_q_fitj_~ comes from the noun class(e) + suffixe-ification , nat iona l~ comes from the adjective national + suffixe-isation , climatisflrLOj2 <air-conditioning> comes from the noun climat +-isation ; these words have been derived on the same way, with the samesemantic aspect: the suffixe -is- + -er (verbal ending) = .tsar or -is- +-ation (noun ending) = -isation has the property to make a verb or a nounwhich expresses an action, from adjectives (national) or nouns (cfimat);words ending with -ification or -isation are always feminine nouns.In some cases, at first sight, the morphology does not give reliableinformation: a word ending by -ement can be an adverb (derived fromadjective) or a masculine noun: for example lachement <slackly> is adverband rel&chement <slackening> masculine noun, but a more precise studybrings the following information: -Scent  ==> adverb except 3 roots:agr#ment complSment increment and except the word #lSnrent ; -Oment==> adverb: assidOment; -ublement -iblement -ivement ==> adverb derivedfrom an adjective:indissolublement visiblement h#tivement ; .oment .rment-gment ==> noun: moment sarment fragment ; -issement -ionnement ==>noun derived from a verb: vagissement positionnement,At last, as far as neological production uses these elements and these rulesto create new words, ~Q.Q.LQg\[.~,ZLE# analysed exactly as the other werd~ (seeGuilbert and Kokourek).These morphological properties of each word are the second kind ofarlchorln~ nolnt~ for pattern matching,D.
The grammar :1. the grammar of the complex noun or prepositional phrase:The phase is considered as a three level hierarchical structure (finitenumber of levels): the grammar is not recursive (on that point joiningTesn lbre  and leaving Chomsky):  phrase = complex noun or prepositionalphrase which is composed of simple noun phrases which are composed ofwords or ".&ggJ_uJ\[DE\[#~" words.A oomolex noun D.br.~,&e (cnp) is:* either a simple noun phrase alone (G=snp)- or a train of simple noun phrases separated by: an expernalpreposition (p=de, clans, pour), or a conjunction co-ordinating sap (c=et ,ou ), or a conjunction co-ordinating prepositional phrase (C=et , ou) andfollowed by a preposition (Cp=et de , ou avac), or a preposition preceding aninfinitive (q=de, ~, pour ) or a present participle (r=-ant).These snp have between them relations of subordination or co-ordination.2.
the grammar of the simple noun phrase:A ~ is a train of words obeying two types of constraints:- ~Ey.QL&EEg..~, when the phrase agrees with a dependency tree- EI.OE.QtLQJQgJ_0~, which is usually named gender.number agreementA .~#,ttern of a snD is a horizontal Dro!ection of a sub-etemma of_#,canon ica l  etemma.
Let us remember that a stomma (word introduced byTesni~re) is a dependency  t ree .
The canonical stemma represents anabstract of ~ ~ .a sub-stemma is: - either the unchanged canonical stemma,- or the canonical stemma without a leaf,- or a sub-stemma without a leaf.A stemma is a ~.9_~\ [L r i \ ]g j \ ] .~ram:  the vertical dimension of thehierachical levels and the horizontal dimension of the written words; a stemmacan be horizontally projected to obtain the one dimensional train of wordsas they are written.
Here is an example of a possible canonical stemma of thesnp, and its projection:I Idot adv ady adj noun adv adv adj adv adv adjdependency relations: adj ........... > noun (depends on)projection relations: dot .

>det  (is projected as)There is a snp pattern for every sub-stemma of the canonical stemma.
Thethree canonical sternmas now used are equivalent  to about 2000rewrit ing ru les .The "aggluUnatlon" rules are applied JZIE\[ .~L~312 from right to leftand are the bottora-up aspect of the algorithm:- every adjective can be an agglutinated adjective (A) as the result ofthe co-ordination of several adjectives: ?b?->A Bb?->A ==> ?=adjectives- in the forms: noun de noun or: noun ,t noun, we have JAL~.ES\[~os i t iona l_  phr~e..~, working like ~ (B), which are included in thesnp, and processed a s .

The prepositionalphrases which can be considered as adjectives are not only preceded by: de &en, but potentially by every preposition, for example in:t \ ] g .

t _A~~We shall now deduce linguistic information from the form of the snp.
Forexample, if we analyse the form: un \[unknown.word\] (d?
), we can deduce thatthis unknown word is a masculine singular noun for two reasons: it matches thepattern: determiner - noun, and the whole snp inherits its gender and numberfrom the determiner.
Here is an ambiguous case: \[unknown word 1\] \[unknownword 2\] (??
); we have here three solutions: either noun - adjective , oradjective - noun, or noun - apposed noun..
It is often possible to decide by amorphological study of each word:I'~lectrlclt6 c~r~Jbrale --> d??
and Iclt6 ==> singular feminine noun==> noun - ad!ectiveune nouvelle conception --> d??
and tlon ==> singular feminine noun==> .~ jg .D JL~lee andes alpha --> d??
and no number agreement=> noun - a~xx)sed nounIn the texts now processed (content tables of scientific books), we havenoun - adiectiy.#, in about 97 % eases, probably because French is a centrifugal270language: the governor first, then the dependants (see Wagner et Pinchon page155, Tesnibre pages 33 and 147).
For example, la linguistique infornratiqueand rinformatique linguistique which are morphologically ambiguous, are bothunderstood by a native speaker as a form: no~_0_z_&d~.If we choose to obtain only one analysis to get one deduction, we must havean order of trial, barring syntactical or morphological impossibility: this orderis now: noun - adiective, then adjective - noun, then noun - apposed noun,with three stemmas tried in this order.3.
some p~rsing difficulties:Wrong deductions upon the category come in the cases we have severalpossible analysises aod whorl morphology does not implies the category:o what does et coordinate ?wdeur \[(Iocalisatrice) et (pronostique)\] noun \[(adjective) el (adjective)\]\[(valour Iocalisatrice) et (pronostique)\] \[(snp) et (noun)\]two possible analysises according to whether of co-ordinates two snp or twoadjectives; then orenostique can be analysed as noun or adjective;- if the pattern is ??
without any possible morphological deduction, the formnourt - adjective will be choased, and that rnay be wrong in some rare cases.But at the end of the parsing of the text, the lexicon is extracted and it ispossible to consull it to reparse the ambiguous phrases.A.
How syntax  and morpho logy  work  together :In such a pars~rr, the parsed language implies a parsing strategy: in French,syntax gives more information than morphology; for example, in Englishrnarphology is peer and syntax becomes more important, in German,morphology is richer because of declensions and file three genders.
So, inFrench, etbA~j2~.. \[O.g~iUi~ e.~l b~'z~Z ~t aj?a__n ~s o ~L0 i~\ [ i~h t ~by~tp  h el ogy:.
at the beginning, we look if it is possible to deduce its category, genderand number, and the deduction is marked sure or not sure, for example:qcit6 ==> feminin singular noun, sure (61ectricitd)-ement ==> masc.
singular noun (enregistremont) or adverb (pumment)-ant ==> present participle, not sure (concerrrant or passant)?
in the study of each snp, every category and some geoders and numbersare known and the gender-number agreement is verified, for example:-at and adjective (deduced by syntax) ==> masculine singular (principal)-ives and adjective ==> feminine plural (qualitatives)If a snp does not agree in goader and number, the analysis fails and thenext stomma is tested.B.
General  ease:First, some n~placoments are made in the phrase submitted to the analysis,for example: space inserted after the apostrophes to isolate /' or d' asone word, autour de --> autour.de (one word), du o-> de le , des --> de los,au --> ",) le , aux -.> # los .Then for each word, the lexicon is consulted, and if not found, the firstmorphological study is made (see above), whence the set of the possiblecategories of each word; this set is classed in the order of trial.Then the ~h.
?L6Lh~Lg_ J~_r l : Ls~ t ) ~  is made from tirecombinations of the possible categories of each word, and from contextualconstraints of each letter of the pattern; these constraints are as severe aspossible to reduce the number of combinations as much and as soon as possible:for example, for the phrase: 6volution de 1'61octro..enc6phalodramn?e d'unmalade attaint de paralysie g6n6rale salon los effete du traitement, then umber of possible patterns is reduced from 1250 to 8.\ ]hen, each pattern is tested until the first successful analysis, except ifthere are possible adverbs, infinitives or present participle.
In that case, ameasure of the quality of the analysis is made to get only tile best analysis.The test of ol~a pattern is made in the following way: the pattern bysnp is calculated: I'electricit& c6r6brale --> d??
--> G (G=snp); maladiesmentales et 16starts du cerveau --> ??c?od?
--> GcG (o=prepesition internalto snp); /'activation par fermeture des yeux --> d?p?od?
.-> GpG (theactivation by closing eyes) (p=preposition external to snp).We verify that this pattern by snp carl constitute a cnp (top-down aspect).The patterns by snp may be for example: G (snp) GcG (co-ordinated snp) GpG(sub.ordinated snp) GrG (two snp separed by a present participle).We try to apply tile .&gg\[g.t~3.tLg_qJM..L~.
(bottom-up aspect: see above).\]'hen we study each snp: - we test if it is possible to find a match with oneof the three sternmas tested in the order: ~r~.g .~._ tL~,  then d .
~.O.#J, tB, then ##g.B ._ - .
.
.
.~ ,  whence a deduced or confirmed category(noun or adjective) for every question mark; - we test if we have agender-number agreement between the governing noun and its eventualdepending determinant and adjectives; this is done by a set intersectionalgorithm and by getting gender and number of the determinants from thelexicon, and by a morphological study (see above) of adjectives and nounswhose category h\[~s just been deduced.At any moment, if a constraint is not satisfied, the test of this pattern isstopped and the next one is tested.A bracketed phrase gives the history of the analysis.Co A pars ing example :valour Iocallsatrlc~ et pr'onostlquoprocess by ward:?
