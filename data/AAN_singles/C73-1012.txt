ENRICO CAMPANILE- ANTO~qIO ZA~POLr~PROBLEMS IN COMPUTERIZED HISTORICAL LINGUISTICS:THE OLD CORNISH LEXICON *f tThis work represents an attempt o utilize the computer in solvingproblems in historical inguistics.The corpus upon which it operates i not a language but a recentlypublished etymological dictionary of Old Cornish.
1 Any observationsregarding the scarcity or inaccuracy of the data utilized are, therefore,irrelevant, as far as the present paper is concerned.As the dictionary in question was compiled according to the usualmethods employed with such works, a detailed explanation of metho-dology is unnecessary.
It should also be noted that Old Cornish isknown only through glosses to Latin words, and that in this case <~ Cor-nish gloss ~ is equivalent o ~ Cornish word ~.With the help of the computer, we have attempted to solve thefollowing problems:a) To establish the percentage of words with and without Indo-European etymology in the Cornish lexicon.
(Let us stress that thisstudy concerns not a language but an etymological lexicon; hence, thepresence or absence of Indo-European etymology should not be con-strued as a definitive characteristic of a Cornish word.
Such statisticsare, in fact, relevant only to the present state of research on the subject).b) To establish the degree of certainty concerning the materialof Indo-European etymology.c) To evaluate the extent of the connection between elements ofIndo-European etymology existing in the Cornish lexicon and theother Indo-European linguistic groups according to the degree ofcertainty of each individual etymology.d) To establish, on the basis of existing etymological studies ofOld Cornish, the lines future research should follow.
* The computational part of this research as been conducted by A. Zampolli,the historical linguistics part by E. Campanile.1 E. CAMPAmL~, Profilo etirnologico del Cornico antico, Pisa, 1974.
Also in SSL,(1973), p. 1.11162 E. CAMPANILE- A. ZAMPOLLIThe reader will observe that the ftrst problem is purely statistical(though it has an obvious diachronic premise), that the second aimsat attaining qualitative data (though they are expressed quantitatively),that the third concerns the area o f  Indo-European dialectology, and thatthe fourth has its own specific heuristic and methodological signifidance.In order to acc0mplish these goals, the contents of the etymologi-cal dictionary were put on cards, each of which contained the follow-ing entries:a) a non-Cornish word (with an indication of the language towhich it belongs);b) the Cornish word related in the dictionary to the item under a) ;c) the type of relationship existing between item a) and item b) ;and whether this relationship is afftrmed, denied or uncertain;d) the indication that item b) is or is not a nominal compound(this being the only type of compound found in Old Cornish);e) in the event that item b) is a nominal compound, a break-down of the elements contained in it; 2f )  the page from which the foregoing material was taken.With regard to item c), the possible types of relationships havebeen described (see below) according to the information supplied,either explicitly or implicitly, by the etymological dictionary and havebeen rated according to the following numerical system:1 = the relationship between the two words is etymologically certain.2 = ~ ~) very probable.3 = ~ ~ probable4 = ~ ~ doubtful5 = ~ ~ not very probable6 ----- ~ ~ improbable7 = ,~ ~ non-existent8 = the Cornish word was borrowed from item a)80 = ~ ~ is a caique from item a)82 = a relationship exists between the Cornish word and item a),but the nature of the relationship cannot be determined exactly(that is, whether it is a matter of kinship or loan).aEvery element has been given either in the Cornish form (if it is attested elsewherein the text or if it is not attested only be cause of lack of documentation), or inthe common Celtic form or in the Indo-European form; certain diacritic signs indicatewhich possibility has been chosen.?
~ The distinction between borrowed words and co-radicals is that provided by theetymological dictionaries and handbooks of historical inguistics.

-"To these eleven ratings will be added that of 0 which will not indi-cate the relationship between Cornish and non-Cornish voices, as in thecase of the other ratings, but will serve instead to distinguish the non-Cornish words (actually, Cymric) which, due to the various vicissi-tudes of  the handwritten tradition, have crept into the authentic Cor-nish glosses and which, as such, do not form part of the present study.The following items, taken from the etymological dictionary, andtheir ratings illustrate the preceding principles:roan gl.

And finally, the compound hewuil, as a creation of theCornish (or Celtic) age, has no precise equivalents in other Indo-Euro-pean languages, and any equivalents that happen to exist may be con-sidered a priori only the result of chance.The task of analyzing compounds is further complicated by thepresence of words (the Latin credere, for instance) that from a diachro-nic point of view are compounds while from a synchronic point ofview they are not.For the reasons just stated, we decided to eliminate the compoundsfrom the present analyses and to make them the object of a separatestudy.Thus, in addition to the words with a rating of 0, entries containingthe signs = and-or - have also been discarded.166 E. CAMPANILE- A. ZAMPOLLIAfter the words with a rating of 0 and the nominal compoundswere discarded, the surviving Cornish material consisted of 745 ele-ments that, in relation to our first problem, were subdivided in thefollowing way.words of Indo-European etymology s 284 38 ?/owords borrowed from other languages 9 254 34 ?/ocalques from other languages 10 0 0 ?/ouncertain kind of kinship 11 0 0 %words without Indo-European etymology 1~ 207 28 ?/o745 100 %With regard to the second problem, the 284 words of Indo-Euro-pean etymology were divided according to the degree of probability.The breakdown is as follows:words of certain etymology 13words of very probable etymology 14words of probable etymology 15238 84 ?/o23 8%23 8 ?/o284 100 ?/oIn order to solve the third problem, all the entries containing non-Cornish words correlated to one of the 284 Cornish words of Indo-European etymology were taken into consideration.

This is due to the fact that not all Indo-Europeanlanguages are represented in the etymological dictionary that providedthe material for the present work.
On the other hand, there are twonon-Indo-European languages in group 17 because one Cornish wordis thought o have a kinship with non-Indo-European words.Each of the 742 words has an etymological kinship with Cornishwords that is either certain (rating 1), very probable (rating 2) or pro-bable (rating 3).
These words were arranged into linguistic groupswith the rank of 1 going to the group that had at least one exponentwith a rating of 1, the rank of 2 going to the group with at leastone exponent with a rating of 2, and the rank of 3 to the group withneither rating.

Ano-ther 16 ~ have etymologies that are either very probable (23; 8 ~)  ormerely probable (23; 8 ~).3) With regard to etymological kinships with non-Celtic Indo-European linguistic groups, the closest connections are with German(0.2291), Latin (0.1698), Indo-~yan (0.1523), Greek (0.1469) andwith Baltic (0.1146).
Such results appear to be extremely importantin that they conftrm the innovative character of the occidental lexicon(kinships with German, Latin and, at least in part, Baltic) existing sidewith the preservation of archaic elements in lateral areas (kinship withIndo-Aryan), thereby showing strong kinships with the central areaof the Indo-European world (Greek and, at least in part, Baltic) whichhave yet to be adequately assessed.4) The highest' percentages of now unacceptable relationshipssuggested by scholars in the past are those with Lati/a (0.2600), Greek(0.1350) and Indo-A_ryan (0.1300).
This, together with the fact thatthese same groups have also yielded a very high percentage of accep-table etymologies, suggests that these areas have been exhausted.
Asworking hypothesis, new etymological comparisons ought now to beconsidered particularly with German and Baltic, which combine ahigh yield with a more tolerable percentage of acknowledged errors(0.0850 and 0.0750 respectively).170 E. CAMPANILE- A. ZAMPOLLI5) Of the 745 Cornish words which have supplied the materialfor the present study, as many as 671, almost 90 ?/o, bear at least anindex of 9; that is, have one or more Celtic co-radicals.
This confirmsthe , compact ~) character of the Celtic lexicon.Moreover, there are Cornish words which have one or more in-dices of 9 to the exclusion of any other index (139; 18 ~/o)" Theseare words that have co-radicals exclusively in the Celtic world.
Onthe heuristic level, this verification gives rise to a question that is atthe same time a working hypothesis: are they substratum words?The same question and the same working hypothesis also arise withthe words where one or more indices of 9 accompany the indices4, 5, 6, 7: these are words with Celtic co-radicals formerly thoughtto be of Indo-European etymology but now refuted in the dictionary,They are 60.Our analysis, therefore, seems to suggest, oo, that future linguisticresearch will fred rich material for substratum studies in Cornish and,more generally, in Celtic.
