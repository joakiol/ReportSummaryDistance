DEEP CASES FOR ADVERBIAL AND PREPOSITIOI~AL PHRASESLieven Jaspaer tSect ion  of Appl ied L ingu is t i cs ,  Kathol ieke Un ivers t te t t  LeuvenBlinds Inkomststraat 21, 3000 Leuven, BelgiumThis paper attempts to demonstrate the use fu lness  fo rMachine Trans la t ion  of a case-or iented  escr ip t ion  of the syn-tac t i c  and the semantic behavior  of adverb ia l  and prepos i t iona lconst ruct ions .Ee aim to modify and re f ine  the ex is t ing  descr ip t iohs  ofadverbs and prepos i t iona l  phrases in  order  to put them toe f f i c ient  use in  Machine Trans la t ion .
We hope to po in t  out ,fur thermore,  the des i rab i l i ty  of incorporat ing  deep case in -fo rmat ion  in to  the " in ter face  s t ruc ture"  of a Machine Trans -la t ion  system.I.
Task-svecific requirements on parsingPars ing  sentences  fo r  t rans la t ion  purposes i s  bound todiffer i~ significant ways from parsing natural language forother tasks.
In this paragraph, we will formulate a n,,mbar oftranslation-speclfio requirements on natural language analy-sis which, moreover, will be of particular interest in thediscussion of the issues in the following paragraphs.2.
Surface cases, deep cases and conceptual caqesA much debated issue in AI is the desirable depth of thecase system employed In natural language understandingprograms.
From the preceding paragraph, however, it will havebecome apparent that, in Machine Translation, one could better- 137  -make use of  var ious  case systems of  inc reas ing  depth.
Inth i s  paragraph,  we w i l l  be concerned wi th  the de f in i t ion  ofthe th ree  types of  oases we cons ider  to  be adequate fo r  t rans -la t iona l  purposes:  ( i )  sur face  cases  re f lec t  the dependencyre la t ion~ which ex is t  between const i tuents  and the i r  gover -nors ;  ( i i )  deep cases  prov ide  in fo rmat ion  about the va lencyboundnese of  the par t i c ipants  in  the pred icat ion ;  ( i l i )  con-ceptus l  cases  are language- independent  va lues  which g ive  in -fo rmat ion  about the s ta tes  of  a f fa i r s  people ta lk  about .3.
Deep ca~eq fo r  adverb ia l  and prepos i t iona l  phrasesI t  i s  common pract i ce  in  va lency grammar to  ass ign  theproper t ies  + valency-bound or - va lency-bound to  const i tuents .We hope to show that  th i s  dichotomy i s  inadequate  fo r  dea l ingwi th  natura l  language in  genera l ,  and wi th  adverb ia l  end pre -pos i t iona l  phrases in  par t i cu la r .
The d i scuss ion  w i l l  aim atin t roduc ing  a th i rd  proper ty  to the set  of  deep cases  ccmnonlyused: the " t renspropos i t iona l  case ?.The main par t  of  th i s  Sect ion  w i l l  be devoted to the de-f in i t ion  of  the t ranspropos i t iona l  case .
We w i l l  po in t  out thedescr ip t ive  and computat iona l  advantages of  the th ree-casesystem proposed,  on the bas i s  of  examples.
This w i l l  lead  to ac lass i f i ca t ion  of  adverb ia l  and prepos i t iona l  const ruc t ionswhich d i f fe rs  in  a cons iderab le  way from the one t rad i t iona l lyused in  l ingu is t i cs .
F~ther  a t tent ion  w i l l  be expended toconst ruc t ions  o ther  than adverb ia l  and prepos i t iona l  ones,which should as we l l  be labe led  t rsnspropoe i t iona l .4.
Conc lus ionIn  the f ina l  paragraph,  we w i l l  b r ie f ly  sketch  the needof in t roduc ing  the t ranspropos i t iona l  case in to  the set  o fdeep case relations, by showing that its omission would leadto bad translations.- 138  -
