A SEMANTIC ANALYSER OF NATURAL ITALIAN SENTENCESM.
Del Canto, F. Fusconl, L. StringaElettrohica San Giorgio - ELSAG S.p.A.Via Hermada, 6 - 16154 Genova - ItalyThis paper presents the analyser for type-written Ital-ian sentences used in the LISA system.This system has been developed in ELSAG within theresearches on Natt~rel Language Processing aimed at making thedialogue with the user easier and more graceful.The analyser was designed to accept input sentenceswithout any constraint on how they are formed (e.g.
in activeor passive form, with a variable number and position of compl-ements, etc.
), and to accept such irregularities as ellipsis,idioms and small grammatical errors.
The present version worksfor simple sentences that are introduced one at a time.The output of the system is an internal conceptual re-presentation that we defined, according to Schank, "concept-ualization".
It represents the meaning of the sentence in anon-ambiguous way and we can define it as an organized set ofpred ioate~argument  l i s t s ,  each of  which can have some modi f -i e rs .
One feature  of the conceptua l i za t ion  format i s  i t sgenera l i ty ,  which permits  to  eas i l y  adapt the system to anynew application.The analyser makes use of a dictionary that includes alexicon, a set of syntactic descriptions and a set of semanticdescr ip t ions .- 82  -The lex icon ,  in  the vers ion  present ly  implemented, con-ta ins  about 2500 words that  permit  the user  to  in t roducesentences  ( s ta tements  or  quest ions  or  answers) con ern ingpeople character i s t i cs  l i ke  age,  p ro fess ion ,  hea l th  andthe i r  ac t ions  and re la t ions  wi th  the externa l  wor ld,  l i ke  togo, to  come, to  t rave l ,  to g ive ,  to  take (TRANSFER), to  know(~OrhEDGE), to  speak, to say (COm~JNICATION), to  own, toconta in  (RELATION), e tc .
