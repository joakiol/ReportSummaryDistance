AbstractThe rapid growth of Internet Technology,especially user friendliness approach, helpsincrease the number of Internet users and theamount of information in the cyberspace.There is a countless amount of information inlanguages.
This has spread developments ofMT systems.
The focus of our approach is toincrease the reusability of those MT systemsby using Cross System machine translation.Using natural language as an intermediatelanguage, such as English, will help us use theinformation in Internet qualitatively.
In thispaper, we point out some problems that maycause the efficiency to decrease when asentence is translated from a second languageto a third language.
A novel method isproposed to solve this problem.1.
IntroductionMachine Translation (MT) is an automaticsystem that provides an ability to convert amessage written in one language (sourcelanguage: SL) to another (target language:TL)[1].
The interlingua approach [2,3], amethodology of constructing an intermediatelanguage, is a dominant approach instandalone system to support multi-language.Many products such as, SYSTRAN [4],BESTILAND [5], are implemented using thisapproach.
Interlingua approach is helpful fora central server, but it is difficult to completeconcepts in Interlingua.The rapid growth of Internet Technology,especially user friendliness approach, helpsincrease the population of users who accessthe Internet and the amount of information inthe cyberspace.
With the increasing amount ofonline information and the rapid growth ofnon-English speaking Internet hosts, it isbecoming increasingly important to offerusers universal access to valuable informationresources in different languages.
TheEuropean Multilingual Information Retrieval(EMIR) project [6], the MULINEX project[7],the TwentyOne project[8], and thecross-language retrieval track in TREC[9]conference all reflect people?s interest inA Cross System Machine TranslationThepchai Supnithi, Virach Sornlertlamvanich, Thatsanee CharoenpornInformation Research and Development DivisionNational Electronics and Computer Technology Center112 Thailand Science Park, Paholyothin Rd.,Klong 1, Klong Luang, Pathumthani 12120THAILAND{thepchai , virach ,thatsanee}@nectec.or.thproviding interoperability among differentlanguage processing environments andmultilingual information retrieval.Distributed system technology plays animportant role to enable us to manageinformation from various places.
This makesit unnecessary to access only the centralserver.
It helps machine translationdevelopers to work individually.
Yasuhara[10] wrote that many machine translationsystems were developed, especially from locallanguage to English, and the language has animportant role as an intermediate language.Our paper tries to apply a distributedtechnique by using English language, which ismostly used by non-English speakers as asecond language to be an intermediatelanguage.
Our approach is not aimed to showthat it is better than the interlingua approach,but it is another solution for us to use existingresources in cyberspace.
We hope that it ispossible to help developers build themachine translation that will supportall languages taking into account ofcost, quantity, and time consumption.In section 2, we show cross systemMT approach.
In section 3, anexample of our approach is given.
Insection 4 we illustrate drawbacks ofthis technique and give an exampleabout how to examine these problems.2.
Cross System MTThe major significance of Asianlanguages is the variation of languagesin the region; most of which use theirown unique set of characters.
In terms ofgrammar, some (Thai, Laotian, Japanese,Chinese, etc.)
do not indicate word boundary,some (Thai, Laotian, etc.)
do not inflect whileothers(Japanese, Korean, etc.)
provideparticles to indicate the word grammaticalfunction, some are not distinguishablebetween sentences and phrases, etc.
These arethe basic difficulties that interest theresearchers in the field of machine translationand the application.Due to these varieties, it is difficult to buildan MT system that supports all languagestaking into account of cost, quantity, and timeconsumption.
Cross system machinetranslation approach is, therefore, an essentialconcept that helps reduce these problems byreusing the large amount of informationexisting in Internet.Figure 1 shows an idea of our cross systemmachine translation approach.

?Searchingtechnology of building MT can be transferredfrom us to other countries in this region andwe know that English is broadly used as abridge to communicate among differentlanguages.
It is simpler for a local developerto build an MT system from his/her locallanguage to English (L1??E).
If allcountries have their own Ln?
?E MT system,sharing English as an intermediaterepresentation language reduces problemsshown above.
Moreover, there are manydifferent ways to develop a MT system.
Ourapproach is to encapsulate the type differencesamong MT systems.
Thus we can decrease thegap among languages by connecting the MTsystem of each local language.Our cross system MT also offers a goodinfrastructure for many future applicationssuch as e-commerce, digital archive,e-publishing, and so on as shown in figure 1.Next we show an example of the usage of across system MT.3.
A Usage Sample ofCross System MTThis chapter shows anapplication of using ourcross system MT.
Figure 2shows an example of ourexpected application toolfor information retrieval.We have two MT systemsin our workgroup, abilingual Thai?
?EnglishMT system and Japanese?
?English MT system.When a user starts to search by input akeyword in Thai, such as a word ???????????

The word ?computer?will be sent to the English?Japanese MTsystem to translate into ?

The word ??

Finally, the output of theworkgroup is web pages that contain thekeyword?????????????
(step 7).
These web pagesare selected from Japanese web pages.This approach helps us to develop a MTsystem that supports all languages taking intoFigure 2.Cross System Information Retrievalaccount of cost, quantity, and timeconsumption.
If each pair of languages can betranslated perfectly, it should produce asatisfactory result for cross system technique.There is, however, a major problem that wehave to consider about the efficiency due tothe fact that the efficiency of each pair ofmachine translation is not completed.
Themore languages we include in our system, theless efficient the system becomes.
In order tofind out the solution for this problem, weshow the linguistic problems and an examplefor solving those problems in the next section.4.
Problems and Solution to ImproveEfficiency from Cross System ApproachThe cross system MT approach seems tobe another solution to develop an MT systemthat is possible to connect to other languages.However, it has a major problem of efficiencydecreasing.
When we consider the efficiencyof translation from the SL to TL, we find thatthe machine translation cannot be transferredcompletely.
Section 4.1 gives the problem thatis possible in linguistics and in section 4.2 ourapproach to transfer information from the firstSL to TL in order to examine these problemsis described.4.1 Linguistic ProblemsManisara Meechoonuk and SompornRakchonlatee [11] evaluated the result ofmachine translation developed in Thailand,they define the linguistic problems as shownin table 1.
In the investigation, they show thatthe result from MT that is perfect translation isabout 29%, comprehensible translation isabout 55%, and incomprehensible translationfor the remaining .
They also state that?Mismatch Concept?
is about 34% found andis the most common linguistic problems .These linguistic problems cause theTable 1.
List of Linguistic Problems and MeaningLinguistics Problems MeaningMismatch Concept Inappropriate concept is selectedMisplaced Modifiers Wrong position of words, phrases or modifiers in TL resulting indistortion of meaningInappropriate Literal Translation An inappropriate translation that follows closely the form of SL.It can be categorized into 1) part of speech, 2) order, 3) idiom.Addition of words or phrases Some words in TL that are not stated in SL are added.Omission of words The meaning of a word or words when translating from SL to TLis/are leaved out.Insufficient definitions of idioms, twoword verbs, and phrasal verbsThe scope or number of words in electronic storage is eitherlimited or inaccurate according to the meanings of words in SLTranslation which does not conform toTarget language grammarA difference sentence structure in TL that may cause anincomprehensible translation.Implicit in both SL and TL The implied meaning of a word in the SL is not expressed clearlyor fully in TLActive in SL but passive in TL The participles appear in SL as active forms but are translatedinto passive forms in TLInsufficient Dictionary Definitions The scope or number of words in the electronic data dictionary islimitedDifferent Semantic Segmentationbetween SL and TLUsing difference marker, such as punctuation or space in SL andTL may cause the incomprehensible translationSpecific in SL but generic in TL A specific word in SL is referred as a general meaning in TLincomplete translation.
An MT system cannotcorrectly translate from second language tothird language if the result of translation fromthe MT system from first language to secondlanguage is not perfect .
We, however, findthat ?Insufficient definitions of idioms,two-word verbs, and phrasal verbs?
and?Insufficient Dictionary Definitions?problems cannot be fixed by the crosslanguage system because of the lack ofinformation before the translation in SL.We examine this problem by adding theinformation from the first language togetherwith the result of second language.
When theMT system translates from the secondlanguage to the third one , it can requestadditional information that is attached fromthe first language as a reference.
Next weshow some examples of using our method.4.2 Examples of Information TransferIn section 4.1, we give linguistic problemsthat cause a decrease of efficiency oftranslation.
In order to increase the efficiency,we illustrate how to give the additionalinformation in order to help the translationwhen the second language functions as asource language.
Our approach is that theinformation we receive from the firstlanguage is the most appropriate information.If we can add additional information from thefirst language as much as we can, it will helpus increase the efficiency of translation.
Weuse an XML as a language to transfer fromfirst language to other languages.For example, we have two MT systems, aThai?
?English MT system andEnglish?
?Japanese MT system.
(1) Looking at the first sentence,???????????
(dek duum ya)?means ?A child drinks a medicine?.But it is translated into ?A child drinks adrug?
by the Thai?English MT system.The problem of this sentence is classified asa ?Mismatch Concept?
problem.
A word???
?has several meanings, such as medicine,drug, cure, tonic and so on.
For this problemwe can add all concepts as a reference asfollows.
?A child <AGT> drinks<?
> a drug<OBJ:c#drug, c#medicine, c#pill,c#tonic> ?This will help the second MT system not totranslate ????
as ?drug?, but refer all conceptsof ????
before the translation.
The result oftranslation should be, ??
byEnglish?Japanese MT system.
(2) Looking at another sentence inJapanese.
?   !
"#$%&'()*+,-. means ? A privatestandard and a wide range internetsecurity has been introduced inInternetExplorer6.
?But it is translated into ?A privatestandard has been introduced as theInternet security whose it is wide range inInternetExplorer6.
?The problem of this sentence is classified asa ?Misplaced Modifiers?
problem.
?Internetsecurity?
which is defined as a privatestandard causes the misunderstanding.
In thisproblem we can add a tag that refers to thefunctions of Internet security (TAR) as areference as follows.A private standard<TAR> has beenintroduced<?> as the Internet security<TAR> whose it is wide range<?> inInternetExplorer6<?>.This will help the second MT system usethe meaning of the CASE relation as TAR as areference.
The result of translation should be,???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Internet Explorer 6?
byEnglish?
Thai MT system. (3) Looking at another sentence inJapanese.
?/0123456789:,-?means ? There is grass that can eat inhills and fields?.But it is translated into ?There is grasseaten in hills and fields?
by theJapanese?English MT system.The problem of this sentence is classified asan ?Active in SL but passive in TL?
problem.A word ??
which shows apossible shape is translated as a passive form.In this problem we can add a tag that refers toa possible form as a reference as follows.
?There is <?> grass<?> eaten<style:possible shape> in hills andfields<?>.
?This will help the second MT system totranslate ?eat?
with a possible shape.
Theresult of translation should be,??????????????????????????????????????????????
byEnglish?Thai MT system.5.
Conclusion and Future WorkDue to the growth of information in digitalworld, the digital divide problem becomesmuch more severe.
We need a system that ispossible to be developed in a short period oftime.
Our approach, cross system MT is a keyfor developing such a system by consideringonly a bilingual MT system.The cross system MT is an alternativesolution to help the countries in the region tocreate their own MT systems by using existingresources when considering the cost, quantity,and time consumption.
This will help themhave a chance to strengthen their economiccompetitiveness and keep their culturepreservations.Since our method tries to give necessaryinformation from the first language, it isappropriate to solve existent linguisticsproblems, such as, ?mismatch conceptions?,?inappropriate literal translation?
and so on.
Itcannot, however, solve some linguisticproblems because of the lack of informationin the first language, such as ?insufficientdictionary definitions?.In this paper, we give an outline of ourapproach, cross system MT, some usages ofthis system and define linguistics problemsthat may cause the efficiency decrease.
Weshow an example of solving those problems.The future work is to analyze essentialinformation for each of the linguisticproblems and subsequently implement oursystem.Reference[1] Briem, S. (2001): Machine Translation.http://www.simnet.is/stbr/vela/html[2]Tucker, Allen B.
