Ways of e s t e n d i n gt h e  model t o  the  a n a l y s i s  of c o m p l e s  sentences are also suggested.The procedures and the model d e s c r i b e d  herein are original;however, tjhey owe much tb i n s i g h t s  found i n  the work  of twsl i n g u i s  ts , Grub,er and Fillmore.The genera l  problem o f  grammar r e c o g n i t i o n  i s  t h a t  o fgoing f r o m  a sur face  s t r i n g  of words rn a deep r c p r c s c n t a t i o nthat p e r m i t s  semantic i n t e r p r c t a 8 i o n .
PIorc s p e c i f i c a l l y  , ourgrammar r e c o g n i t i o n  procedure depends on t h c  identlfica t i o n  ofthe ~ r e c i s e  function or semantic role that each noun phraseactant  occurring in a given sentence exhibits with r e spec t  t c pt he  verb of t h a t  sentence .By a s s i g n i n g  verbs--or, to be more precise, verb, senses--to one o r  more paradigms ( , p e r c e p t u a l l y  and f u n c t i o n a l l yde f ined  surf ace con?

,theme, causal a c t a n t ,  goal, source, l ocus )  t h a t  each noun phrasei n  the sentence bears t o  t h e  verb, thereby a s s i s t i n g  g r e a t l y  Lnarriving at a representation of the mearring of each sentence.A nuhber of verb paradigms such ae intrans Ltive, t rans i t iveand ergative Rre def ined .
Verbs belonging t o  the intransitiveparadigm such a8 die, fall, go, etc.
always  have subjects thatfunction ae t%emes.
Verbs belonging to the transitive paradigmsuch ae k i l l ,  -- read, -S eat  e t c .
have subjects that function ascausal actants -.
- and objects  that function as themes.
The ergativeparadigm, which is more complex, cons Fs t s  of change-of - s t a t everbs such as  open, melt, increase, e tc .
If an ergative para-digm verb has both a subject and- an object, the subject is acausal actant and the object is a theme; however; if such averb takes only a subject, then the subject functions as a theme.The paradigm membership of each verb sense i n  the data base i sdetermined and is recorded as a lexical feature of that  verb.The number o+ verb paradigms would ,proliferate almost in-d e f i n i t e l y  were it not for several devices, b u i l t  into the grammar.One of these d e v i c e s  is the reversal of transformations such asp a s s i v e  and interrogative so that  subject and object  functionalrelations remain the same as i n  active, declarative sentencesAnother such d e v i c e  is the recovery of noun phrase dssationssuch as  the one occurring in a sentence likel"John ate .  "
Inthis case, an indefinite object i s  reco~structed and thetraneitive paradigm feature o f  the verb eat remains intact.
A-th ird  d e v i c e  of thie nature is u s e  of a notion ca l l ed  incorpor;ation.
For exardple, a sentence srtch as "It is raining."
w i l lbe analyzed as having incorporated the theme subject r a in '  i n t o4the verb w i t h  the result that a abstract s t r u c t u r e  resembling"Rain is f a l l i ng"  gets rec80nstructcd and processed as an in-t rans i t ive  verb paradigm item.To overview the e n t i r e  procedure, we s t a r t  by parping thesprface structure of any given sentence.
The  major c o n s t i t u e n t sa,nd parts ofi speech are i d e n t i f i e d .
Nokt, we determine the t y p enf sentence involved (  , d e c l a r a t i v e ,  i n t e r r o g a t i v e ,  imperative)and t ransform the w r d  order where necessary.

P a g e  676Verb Paradigms for Sentence Recognition*PrefaceFor a number of years i n  the early 1970's the  U.S. AirForce sponsored research at System Developmefit Corpora t ion  inthe  a p p l i c a t i ~ n  of n a t u r a l  language processing techniques tocomputer-aided i n s  t r u c  t i ~ p  (CAI)  .
The purpose of t h i s  researchwas to increme t h e  o v e r a l l  effectiveness of CAI as an instruc-tional method, w i t h  particular emphasis on extending the s tudentcomputer interface to permit s tudent-generated f t ee  f o m  responsesand queries.
The research included experiments with  a deduc-t i ve  quest ion-answering s y s t e m  designed f o r  use in C A I ,  themodeling o f  the  behavior of a hypothetical tutzor, and lastlythe computer e v a l u a t i o n  of c o n s t r u c t e d  s t u d e n t  responses ,  and aquestion-answering system driven by a dynamic model of the  CAIlesson content.

This paper describes i n  a gene ra l  way the grammar re-cogn i t ion  model deve1ope.d as part of the CAI P r o j e c t .The model developed was based on the assumption that recog-nition grammars should be constructed quite differently 0-omproduction grammars ( e .

We s t re s s  this distinction becausemany of the verbs that allow.

.
This i s  why we stresstha t  our use c>E the term transttive t : ~  describe the behaviorof a particuLar verb paradigm is more specific and functionallyodented  than other usages of the term.
While i t  i s  true thata l l  of our [+transitive] verbs may occur in the pass ive  as w e l las the  a c t i v e  voice, th i s  fact  is not e defining p r o p e r t y  of[+transitive] verbs in our system but a redundancy rule of s o r t s .Likewise, intransitive means not only that the verb takes asurface eubject and no unmarked surface object  but that th issurface subject is functioning as a theme.Furthermore, from the  recognition p o i n t  of view, we know thatf o r  all verbs marked [+transitive] tho surface subject is t h ecausal actant and tho surface o b j e c t  is t h e  thcmo iT tho ve'rhis in the a c t i v e  voice.A large class of verbs l i k e  open belohg t o  what we referto as the ergative pbradigm.

Also the verb ib an act ive ,d e c l a r a t i v e  English eentence mast, aa e rule, come second.Thus if there ie no causal  a c t a n t  present f i l l i n g  the eubjecte l o t ,  the theme (or a noun phraae beating some other functionalr e l a t i o n )  must f i l l  the subjec t  a l o t .There ere &any ergative paradigm9 verbs in English.

.9~orne readers will quest ion the need f o r  an ergat ive  par&digm and suggest t b t  each such verb be assigned to both theintransitive and transitive paradigms.

With verbs of trans-fer ip the active voice, the surface subject is a source, goal,or causal a c t a n t ,  The theme i s  the surface object .
Otheraspects of the motLon or transfer are usually impl ied .

French,  f o r  example, appears to have a move-ment operation even more general than the goal-res tr ic tedo b j e c  tivalization transformation of Engl i sh .
It is for thisreason that speakers of French say sentences such as "open methe door" when speaking English.
English does n o t  permit themovement o f  "me" to object position in this sentence because"me" is a remote causal ac tant  or source and n o t  a remote goalIn "Open the door for me. "
In this sentence "(you)" is the1 1  immediate causal actant and source and the  verb open" belongsto the ergatiwe paradigm and not to the movement-transfer classof verbs.
Thus the rules o E  English do not permit " ~ o a l  FOCUS"movement to a p p l y  in such a case.In the course of the development of this recognition gram-mr we noted that ccrmp1e.tive aspect ( .

Recall the para-digm f o r  verbs of putting and taking (71) discussed earlier inthe paper:(71) a. John put water in the pool.

There i s ,  however, another paradigm similar to theput-take'  paradigm but different from I t  i n  that a l l  of iteverbs indicate completive aspect .
We refer to t h i s  [+completive]paradigm aa the 'join-separate' paradigm (72.
), which is t h e  para-dim to which the verbs fill and empty, f o r  example, belong.

I n  Rall (19165),  f o rexample, t h e  following sentences were cons-idered more or lessequivalent and thus relatable vi.a a transformational rule whichconsidered the objec-c paint in (73) as basic and the objec t'wall' i n  (74) as der ived:(73)  John smeared paint  on the w a l l .
(74) John srneare'd the w a l l  w i t h  p a i n t .F i l lmore  (1968b, p .

This y i e l d s  'on t h e  Gall' and 'wlth paint' in thedeep structure.
Fillmore then analyzed the verb - smear as havingthe following property: whichever of the ttwo deep structureelements concerned is chosen as the ' d i rec t  object' ,  it mustfall next to the verb and must lose its preposition.While more ar less agreeing with Hall's intuftion that'paint' is a basic 'objectv--in our system 'theme1--Ln (73)  anda derived'object' or d i s p l a c e d  theme in (74), we disagree withher implicit  assumption that sentences such as (73) and (74) aresyntactically or semantically equivalent or the e x p l i c i t  pro-posal  that they should be related by a transformattional rule.We also disagree with Fillmore's decision to analyze 'with' insentences such as (74) as an ins fance of the instrumental case.In our view, aspec tual differences between (73) and (74) c a l lfor a different assignment of Jeep structure functional relationsand necessitate the postulation of distinct paradigms.
In ourana lys i s  the surface object  of (73) is a theme; the verb "smear"expresses an activity s i m i l a r  to " p ~ t t ~ i n g "  i n  (73) and ' the wallie the goal of t he  theme ' p a i n t ' .
In (74) 'smear' is being usedto express the completed joining of a d i s p l a c e d  theme--i. e .
,'paint1-- to the locus--i.e.
, 'wall'.
In other words, our SOB-ution w i l l  analyze verbs such as 'smear ' .
as belonging to two1 dirfererrt paradigms..
In one of the paradigms, smear' behaveslike ' p u t r  and in the  other  it expresfses j o in ing  a f  a loca t ionand a theme.
In this latter sense, the displaced theme isexpressed optionally, though always implied as something presentbut unspecified if not overtly expressed:(75) a.  John smeared the wall with p a i n t .b.

to a paradigm that signals completive aspect.
T h e r e  aretwo paradigms for verbs of contact that a l s o  can be used asexamples.
F i r s t  consider  the non-completive contact paradigmstones at the wall.kicked GoalIn sentences auch as those i n  (79), we cannot i n f e r  that thetheme made contact with the goal;  w e  assume the theme movedtoward the goal, b u t  we do not know whether contact  was -made.Contrast theee sentences with verbs occurring bn the completivecontact paradigm (80) :(80) John {: } the wall with stones.
K?r ombarded Locus Theme(i-comple t i v e )These sentences in (80) force us to infer  that the theme hasmade contact with the locus; no other interpretation i s  possible.In the two sets of paradigms d i s c u s s e d  above, some unusualphenomena have taken place.
In those cases where the verbsignals completive action, the surface order of ac tants ina c t i v e  surfaces is as follows:Surface Surface(81) Subjec t  Object Marked NP+ W?
+ I  NP[ t c o m p l e  tive] 1 + prelwC.A.
Locus Theme46This is n o t  ,the normal orde r  of elements.
The usual surfaceorder f o r  act ive  sentences conta in ing  B c a u ~ a 1  a c t a n t ,  a theme,and a locus is the fo l lowing:Surf ace SurfaceSubject&Obj ec tVThemePrep  9 NPThus is appears that  we g e t  completive aspect only when a locusoccurs i n  the position where one wauld normally expect  the themeto  occur.This  hypo thes i s  is confirmed b y  a completive g a l ~ d i g r n  w i t hno unmarked surface objects that has a locus in subject positionins tead  of  a theme (83).
This paradigm is similar  t o  the non-comple t ive  paradigm which has the  theme i n  subject p o s i t i o n(84) and foll~ws t h e  normal o rde r  of constituents f o r  sentenceshaving o n l y  a theme and a l o c a t i v e  actant:(83) The a rden  is swarming with bees.
*[+co13pletive] Themeare swarming i n  the garden.T erne [-completive] Ldcus (84 )  i?The meanings of t h e s e  sentences have been debated by Fill-more (1968b) and Chomsky (1972), among others.
F i l l m o r e  a ss ignsthe same case represen ta t ion  t o  (83) and (@+) sugges tins t h a tthere i s  a d i f ference  of focus with  perhaps some correspondingdifference in cognitive content Chonsky p o i n t s  o u t  t h a t  t h esentence8 are not synonymous--that in (83) the bees are neces;e a r i l y  a l l  over the garden but that in (84) the bees might beonly around their hive.
In l i g h t  of our analyses of sentences(71) - (80) we suggest t h a t  both  Fillmore' e remarks and Chomaky ' 8remark8 are correct but indomplete.
The functional relationsexhibited by the noun phrases i n  (83) and (84) are the  same,the verb aspect ie different.
This auggeets that there are twoparadigme involved: a completive paradigm accounting for (83) and(85) , and a non-completive paradigm accounting for sentence (84)and similar eentences like (86) :Theme + verb + Locus-[ -completive](85) a.
Passengers are r i d i n g  in t h e  bus.b.

The stream teems w i t h  f i s h .c .
The bag bulged with groceries.With lexically different verbs and preposit ions as in (85)qnd (86) the two paradigms are e a e i l y  distinguishable.
Whenthere is lex ical  overlap i n  different verb penses as in (83) and(84),  the prepositions as well as semantic features will serveto distinguish [+completive] paradigms from [ -completive] paradigmsParadigms and xncotpora t ionI n  the second s e c t i o n  ~f Gruber (1965: 5-27)  there f e  ad i s c u s s i o n  of the gramnatical process of inc~rporation.

can also include verbs likehelp, aid, Bupp- ort, e t c .

Althoughwe can see that  the "Analysis-by-synthesis" model is use fu l  i nexplaining hallucinatory recons t ruc t ion  of speech and r e l a t e dphenomena, w e  feel that  n e i t h e r  their fully act ive  model (nora f u l l y  pass ive  model for t ha t  matter) w i l l  prove t o  recon-s,ruct a c c u r a t e l y  t h e  complexities of normal human speech p e r -cep t ion  o r  to explain human language recognition and comprehension.65facts  of historical.

We are convinced that this know-ledge overlaps wLthY  yet  i s  somehow 3 different from, the knowledgeand skills that are required if one wishes to produce grammaticalsentences in a Language,Kelley (1968) , for example, has postulated that comprehen-s ion  is baaic  in language acquisition and that rules of pro-duction are no t  essential f o r  comprehension but may developalongside o f  the necessary comprehension r u l e s  t o  s a t i s f y  othergoals and purposes.
If Kel ley's  model i s  correct, i t  indicatesthat human recognition graannars--an e s s e n t i a l  component of com-prehens ion--are , no t  mere inverses of human production grammars.T h i s ,  in turn, suggests that the most e f f i c i e n t  computer-basedrecognition procedures will be based, not  exclusively on gen-erative production- t y p e  grammars, but a l s o  on principles and66rules s imi lar  to those that  human beings would seem to employexpressly in language recognition ana ramprchcnsi~n.
