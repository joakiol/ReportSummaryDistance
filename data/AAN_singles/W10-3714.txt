Proceedings of the Multiword Expressions: From Theory to Applications (MWE 2010), page 89,Beijing, August 2010Multi-Word Expressions as Discourse Relation Markers (DRMs)Aravind K. JoshiUniversity of Pennsylvaniajoshi@seas.upenn.edu1 Invited Talk AbstractUsually, by Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) we mean expressions whose structure and meaning can-not be derived from their component words as they occur independently.
In this talk I will discuss adifferent kind of multi-word expressions that behave as discourse relation markers (DRMs), yet do notseem to belong to well-defined syntactic classes.
The apparent open-endedness of these expressions isa challenge for their automatic identification.12 Speaker BiographyAravind Joshi is the Henry Salvatori Professor of Computer and Cognitive Science at the Universityof Pennsylvania.
