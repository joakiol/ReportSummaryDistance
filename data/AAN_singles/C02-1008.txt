Different from conventionalapproaches, in our previous research wedeveloped an approach for exploiting Webanchor texts as live bilingual corpora andreducing the existing difficulties of queryterm translation.
Although Web anchor texts,undoubtedly, are very valuable multilingualand wide-scoped hypertext resources, notevery particular pair of languages containssufficient anchor texts in the Web to extractcorresponding translations in the languagepair.
For more generalized applications, inthis paper we extend our previous approachby adding a phase of transitive (indirect)translation via an intermediate (third)language, and propose a transitive model tofurther exploit anchor-text mining in termtranslation extraction applications.Preliminary experimental results show thatmany query translations which cannot beobtained using the previous approach can beextracted with the improved approach.1.
IntroductionCross-language information retrieval (CLIR),addressing the special need where users canquery in one language and retrieve relevantdocuments written or indexed in anotherlanguage, has become an important issue in theresearch of information retrieval (Dumais et al,1996; Davis et al, 1997; Ballesteros & Croft,1998; Nie et al, 1999).
However, its applicationto practical Web search services has not lived upto expectations, since they suffer a majorbottleneck that lacks up-to-date bilinguallexicons containing the translation of popularquery terms 1  such as proper nouns (Kwok,2001).To enable capability of CLIR, existing IRsystems mostly rely on bilingual dictionaries forcross-lingual retrieval.
In these systems, queriessubmitted in a source language normally have tobe translated into a target language by means ofsimple dictionary lookup.
Thesedictionary-based techniques are limited inreal-world applications, since the queries givenby users often contain proper nouns.Another kind of popular approaches todealing with query translation based oncorpus-based techniques uses a parallel corpuscontaining aligned sentences whose translationpairs are corresponding to each other (Brown etal., 1993; Dagan et al, 1993; Smadja et al,1996).
Although more reliable translationequivalents can be extracted by these techniques,the unavailability of large enough parallelcorpora for various subject domains andmultiple languages is still in a thorny situation.On the other hand, the alternative approachusing comparable or unrelated text corpora werestudied by Rapp (1999) and Fung et al (1998).This task is more difficult due to lack of parallelcorrelation between document or sentence pairs.1In our collected query logs, most of user queriescontain only one or two words, so we use query term,query or term interchangeably in this paper.In our previous research we have developedan approach to extracting translations of Webqueries through mining of Web anchor texts andlink structures (Lu, et al, 2001).
This approachexploits Web anchor texts as live bilingualcorpora to reduce the existing difficulties ofquery translation.
Anchor text sets, which arecomposed of a number of anchor texts linking tothe same pages, may contain similar descriptiontexts in multiple languages, thus it is more likelythat user?s queries and their correspondingtranslations frequently appear together in thesame anchor text sets.
The anchor-text miningapproach has been found effective particularlyfor proper names, such as international companynames, names of foreign movie stars, worldwideevents, e.g., ?Yahoo?, ?Anthrax?, ?Harry Potter?,etc.Discovering useful knowledge from thepotential resource of Web anchor texts is stillnot fully explored.
According to our previousexperiments, the extracted translationequivalents might not be reliable enough when aquery term whose corresponding translationseither appear infrequently in the same anchortext sets or even do not appear together.Especially, the translation process will beunavailable if there is a lack of sufficient anchortexts for a particular language pair.
AlthoughWeb anchor texts, undoubtedly, are livemultilingual resources, not every particular pairof languages contains sufficient anchor texts.To deal with the problems, this paperextends the previous anchor-text-based approachby adding a phase of indirect translation via anintermediate language.
For a query term whichis unable to be translated, our idea is to translateit into a set of translation candidates in anintermediate language, and then seek for themost likely translation from the candidates,which are translated from the intermediatelanguage into the target language (Gollins et al,2001; Borin, 2000).
We therefore propose atransitive translation model to further exploitanchor text mining for translating Web queries.A series of experiments has been conducted torealize the performance of the proposedapproach.
Preliminary experimental results showthat many query translations which cannot beobtained using the previous approach can beextracted with the improved approach.2 The Previous ApproachFor query translation, the anchor-text-basedapproach is a new technique compared with thebilingual-dictionary- and parallel-corpus-basedapproaches.
In this section we will introduce thebasic concept of the anchor-text-based approach.For more details please refer to our initial work(Lu, et al, 2001).2.1 Anchor-Text SetAn anchor text is the descriptive part of anout-link of a Web page.
It represents a briefdescription of the linked Web page.
For a Webpage (or URL) ui, its anchor-text set is definedas all of the anchor texts of the links, i.e., ui'sin-links, pointing to ui.
In general, theanchor-text set records ui's alternative conceptsand textual expressions such as titles andheadings, which are cited by other Web pages.With different preferences, conventions andlanguage competence, the anchor-text set couldbe composed of multilingual phrases, short texts,acronyms, or even ui's URL.
For a query termappearing in the anchor-text set, it is likely thatits corresponding translations also appeartogether.
The anchor-text sets can be consideredas a comparable corpus of translated texts, fromthe viewpoint of translation extraction.2.2 The Probabilistic Inference ModelTo determine the most probable targettranslation t for source query term s, wedeveloped a probabilistic inference model(Wong et al, 1995).
This model is adopted forestimating probability value between sourcequery and each translation candidate thatco-occur in the same anchor-text sets.
Theestimation assumes that the anchor texts linkingto the same pages may contain similar termswith analogous concepts.
Therefore, a candidatetranslation has a higher chance to be an effectivetranslation if it is written in the target languageand frequently co-occurs with the source queryterm in the same anchor-text sets.
In the field ofWeb research, it has been proven that the use oflink structures is effective for estimating theauthority of Web pages (Kleinberg, 1998;Chakrabarti et al, 1998).
The model furtherassumes that the translation candidates in theanchor-text sets of the pages with higherauthority may have more reliability inconfidence.
The similarity estimation functionbased on the probabilistic inference model isdefined below:(1)              .)()|()()|())(()()()()(1111????====??=????=?
?=?ninininiiiiiiiuPutsPuPutsPutsPutsPtsPtsPtsPThe above measure is adopted to estimate thedegree of similarity between source term s andtarget translation t. The measure is estimatedbased on their co-occurrence in the anchor textsets of the concerned Web pages U = {u1, u2, ...un}, in which ui is a page of concern and P(ui) isthe probability value used to measure theauthority of page ui.
By considering the linkstructures and concept space of Web pages, P(ui)is estimated with the probability of ui beinglinked, and its estimation is defined as follows:P(ui)= L(ui)/?j=1,n L(uj), where L(uj)= the numberof in-links of page uj.
Such estimation issimplified from HITS algorithm (Kleinberg,1998).In addition, we assume that s and t areindependent given ui, then the joint probabilityP(s?t|ui) is equal to the product of P(s|ui) andP(t|ui), and the similarity measure becomes:(2).)(]||)|()|([)(||)(11?
?==?+?=?niniiiiiiiiiuP)u)P(tuP(sutPusPu)Pu)P(tuP(stsPThe values of P(s|ui) and P(t|ui) are defined tobe estimated by calculating the fractions of thenumbers of ui?s in-links containing s and t overL(ui), respectively.Therefore, a candidate translation has a higherconfidence value to be an effective translation ifit frequently co-occurs with the source term inthe anchor-text sets of the pages with higherauthority.2.3 The Estimation ProcessFor each source term, the probabilistic inferencemodel extracts the most probable translation thatmaximizes the estimation.
The estimationprocess based on the model was developed toextract term translations through mining ofreal-world anchor-text sets.
The process containsthree major computational modules: anchor-textextraction, term extraction and term translationextraction.
The anchor-text extraction modulewas constructed to collect pages from the Weband build up a corpus of anchor-text sets.
On theother hand, for each given source term s, theterm extraction module extracts key terms as thetranslation candidate set from the anchor-textsets of the pages containing s. At last, the termtranslation module extracts the translation thatmaximizes the similarity estimation.
For moredetails about the estimation process, please referto our previous work (Lu et al, 2001).To make a difference from the translationprocess via an intermediate language, the aboveprocess is called direct translation, and theadopted model called direct translation modelhereafter.
Meanwhile, we will use functionPdirect in Equation (3) for the estimation of thedirect translation.

(log),( tsPtsPdirect ?=3 The Improved Approach3.1 The Indirect Translation ModelAs mentioned above, for those query termswhose corresponding translations either appearinfrequently in the same anchor text sets or donot appear together, the estimation with equation(2) is basically unreliable.
To increase thepossibility of translation extraction especiallyfor the source terms whose correspondingtranslations do not co-occur, we add a phase ofindirect translation through an intermediatelanguage.
For example, as shown in Fig.
1, ouridea is to obtain the corresponding targettranslation ????
in simplified Chinese bytranslating the source term ????
in traditionalChinese into an intermediate term ?Sony?
inEnglish, and then seek for translating ?Sony?into a target term ????
in simplified Chinese.For both the source query and the targettranslation, we assume that their translations inthe intermediate language are the same and canbe found.The above assumption is not unrealistic.For example, it is possible to find the Chinesetranslation of a Japanese movie star throughsubmitting his/her English name to a searchengine and browsing the retrieved Chinese pagescontaining the English name.
The Web containslarge amounts of multilingual pages, andEnglish is the most likely intermediate languagebetween other languages.
Based on thisassumption, we extend the probabilisticinference model and propose an indirecttranslation model as the following formula:(4)      ).(log)(log)]()(log[),(log),(tmPmsPtmPmsPtmmsPtsPindirect?+?=?????
?=, where m is the transitive translation of s and tin the intermediate language, P(s?m) andP(m?t) are the probability values obtained withthe direct translation model which can becalculated by Equation (2).3.2 The Transitive Translation ModelThe transitive model is developed to combineboth the direct and indirect translation modelsand improve the translation accuracy.
Bycombining Equation (3) and (4), the transitivetranslation model is defined as follows:???

We havecollected 1,980,816 traditional Chinese Webpages in Taiwan.
Among these pages, 109,416pages whose anchor-text sets contained bothtraditional Chinese and English terms weretaken as the anchor-text set corpus.
We alsocollected 2,179,171 simplified Chinese Webpages in China and extracted 157,786 pageswhose anchor-text sets contained both simplifiedChinese and English terms.
In addition, throughmerging the two Web page collections into alarger one, we extracted 4,516 Web pagescontaining both traditional and simplifiedChinese terms.
The three comparable corporaprovide a potential resource of translation pairsfor some Web queries.
In order to realize thefeasibility in translating query terms viatransitive translation, we aim at finding out thecorresponding simplified Chinese translations oftraditional Chinese query terms via English asthe intermediate language.Fig.

(TraditionalChinese)s : source termt : target translationm : intermediate translation??
(SimplifiedChinese)We also collected popular query terms withthe logs from two real-world Chinese searchengines in Taiwan, i.e., Dreamer and GAIS2.The Dreamer log contained 228,566 uniquequery terms from a period of over 3 months in1998, and the GAIS log contained 114,182unique query terms from a period of two weeksin 1999.
There were 9,709 most popular queryterms whose frequencies were above 10 in bothof the logs and 1,230 of them were Englishterms.
After filtering out the terms which wereused locally, we obtained 258 terms.
Thesequery terms were taken as the major test set inthe term translation extraction analysis.
Thetraditional Chinese translations of the test queryterms were determined manually and taken asthe source query set in the followingexperiments.According to our previous work (Lu et al,2001), there were three methods for termextraction, which is a necessary process step inextracting translations from anchor-text corpus.Since we have not yet collected a query log insimplified Chinese, in the following experimentswe adopted the PAT-tree-based keywordextraction method, which is an efficientstatistics-based approach that can extract longerterms without using a dictionary (Chien, 1997).To evaluate the achieved performance ofquery translation, we used the average top-ninclusion rate as a metric.
For a set of test queryterms, its top-n inclusion rate is defined as thepercentage of the query terms whose effectivetranslation(s) can be found in the top n extractedtranslations.4.2 Performance with the DirectTranslation ModelIn order to realize the feasibility of the transitivetranslation model, we carried out someexperiments based on the direct translationmodels and the three different anchor-text setcorpora in the first step.
Table 1 shows theresults of the obtained top-5 inclusion rates,2These two search engines are second-tier portals inTaiwan, whose logs have certain representatives inthe Chinese communities, and whose URL?s are asfollows: http://www.dreamer.com.tw/ andhttp://gais.cs.cu.edu.tw/.where terms ?TC?, ?SC?
and ?ENG?
representtraditional Chinese, simplified Chinese andEnglish terms respectively.
The performance oftranslating TC into SC is worse than that of theother two since the size of the anchor-text setcorpus containing both TC and SC is relativelysmall in comparison with the others.
This is whywe are pursuing in this paper to integrate thedirect translation with the indirect translation viaa third language.
However, the performance ofthe direct translation from TC to SC is used as areference in comparison with our proposedmodels in the following experiments.Table 1.
Top-n inclusion rates obtained with thedirect translation model and the three specificlanguage pairs corpora.Type Top1 Top2 Top3 Top4 Top5TC=>SC 35.7% 43.0% 46.9% 49.6% 51.2%TC=>ENG 68.6% 82.2% 85.7% 88.0% 88.8%ENG=>SC 45.3% 55.8% 59.3% 61.6% 64.0%4.3 Performance with the Indirect andTransitive Translation ModelsTo realize the improvement using the transitivetranslation model, some further experimentswere conducted.
As shown in Table 2, theindirect and transitive translation modelsoutperform than the direct translation model.
Asmentioned above, the size of the anchor-textcorpus that contains both TC and SC is small.The indirect translation model is, therefore,helpful to find out the corresponding translationsfor some terms with low-frequency values in thecorpora.
For example, the traditional Chineseterm ????
?
was found can obtain itscorresponding translation equivalent ????
?in simplified Chinese via the intermediatetranslation ?Siemens?, which cannot be foundonly using the direct translation.By examining the top-1 translationsobtained with the three different models, it wasfound that the inclusion rates can be from 44.2%using the indirect translation to 49.2% using thetransitive translation model.
Table 3 illustratessome of the translations extracted using thetransitive translation model.Table 2.

The lexicon contained morethan 23,948 word/phrase entries in bothtraditional Chinese and simplified Chinese.
Itwas found the top-1 inclusion rate that using thelexicon lookup was 12.4% which is obviouslylower than the 49.2% that using the proposedtransitive translation model.
In addition, thetop-1 inclusion rate can reach to 55.8% (see thelast row of Table 2) if both of the approaches arecombined.
With the combined approach, thetranslation(s) of a query term is picked up fromthe lexicon if such a translation is already in thelexicon, otherwise it is obtained based on thetransitive translation model.5 Concluding RemarksAnchor-text set corpus is a valuable resource forextracting translations of Web queries.
How toexploit such kind of corpora in query translationis a challenging and potential research task.
Inthis paper, we extend our previous approach byproposing a transitive translation model andachieve some improvements on translating thosequeries whose translations cannot be extractedusing the previous approach.
The improvedapproach has been proven particularly useful forthe specific language pairs whose anchor textsare insufficient.
However, there are still someproblems need to be further investigated in thefuture.ReferencesBallesteros, L. and Croft, W. B.
