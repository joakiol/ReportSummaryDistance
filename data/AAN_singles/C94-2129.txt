San Sebast ian,  SpainE-mai l  : j ipzuai j@si .ehu.esAbstractIn this paper we present a dialogue model which hasas its main goat to place in context the utterancegenerated by the speaker.
The dialogue modelconsiders that an intervention generates one or moreilocutive acts which are handled as flmctions.
Thesefunctions ubcategorize to or are subcategorized byother functions in the dialogue.The model uses an exchange schema with thepurpose of expressing the different ftmctionalsubcategorizations.
These schemas have propertiesclose to the semantic forms of the verbs in a lexical-functional context.1 INTRODUCTIONIn task-orientetl dialogues two speakers work incooperation with the purpose of carrying out a plan.This type of interaction has a start and a developmentstructured by the restrictions of space, thne, transactionobject and role of the partieipanls.A number of researchers \[Grosz and Sidner, 86;Litman and Allen, 87; Ramshaw, 91; I.ambert andCarberry, 9211 have suggested that a coherent discourseconsists of segments that are related to one anotherthrough some type of structuring relation.
Our dialoguemodel tries to capture the goal-oriented nature ofdiscourse, ideutifing the discourse structure by providingthe details of a computational mechanism forrecognizing the structural relationships.The model enables the incremental recognition ofcommunicative goals using rewriting rules andfunctional equations.
The grammar constructs thestructural tree captnring the dialogical functions of thediscourse using functional snbcategorization.
Thesubcategorization process improves on previousapproaches \[Ferrary et al, 88; Bilage, 91; JOnsson, 911,increasing the expresive power of the traditional dialoguemodels by modeling the relationships among thecommunicative actions enabling the task of connectingdiscottr~.The different parts of the system have beenimplemented using a blackboard architecture.
Theprocess tarts obUfining the f-slructure associated to theintervention making use of a lexical-functional grammar\[Abaitua ct al., 9111.

Then, the planner and/or the dialoguemodule suu't o work.In the remainder of this paper, we will present ourdialogue model in a top-down manner.
Firstly, we showthe exchange structure attoptexl and the subcategorizationprocess using two samples.
Then, we explain theretroactive and proactive nature of the interaction and weconclude by presenting two kinds of specialinterventions, the complex ~lll(l compound interventions.2 EXCI IANGE STRUCTUREWe assign to the constituents of the exchange levelinitiative and reactive ilocutive functions.
Thesefunctions qualify ctmstituents which are in the samelevel of structuration.
The initiative functions areassigned to the directriee interventions of the exchange.The reactive functions constitute the generic lass of theanswers and they try to satisfy the obligations assumedfor the interpretation f the initiative functions.Analyzing the corpus that we dispose we havedetected the following initiative functions : Fre q, Fre q-prel , Freq_aux, Freq_fic, Fqinlbr m, Fqref and Fqi f. Fre qis a function associated with a petition of achievement aphysical action.
Fqinlbr m inquires inlonnation about heplan in progress.
Fqref and Fqi f demand referential ndpolar information.The above initiative functions are completed with thelollowing reactive functions : Finformre q, Finform,Fiafref and Finfif.We assign to the initiative functions, with directricecharacteristics, one exchange schema with similarperformance to the semantic forms of the verbs in alexical-functienal context.
This exchange schema will tx~identified from now with the word SCItEMA.
Anschema specification will exhibit he subcategorizationsdetected inside an exchange.
Therefore, an exchange withau initiative function of type Fqinfor m, inside which anested exchange has been produced, will have thefollowing schematic representation :SCHEMA = "Fqinform# <( 1" Ecomp ) ( T Finform)>"l Freq_prel, Freq_au x and Freq_fi c are functionssubcategorized by Fre q and represent preliminaries, auxiliarforms of the request mid fictitious executions of actions.8i3SCHEMA = "<( \[Sugcategorized_by\] ) > # F x #<( \[Sugcategorizeto\] )>"Just like in a lexical-functional grammar, the initiativefunction Fqinfor m subcategorizes to the reactive functionFinform and to a subexchange identified by Ecomp.
Thissubexchange has, at the same time, a specific initiativefunction which subeategorizes to the appropriate r activefunction and which is subeategorized by the Fqinfor mfunction.
One example of dialogue sequence where thisschema could be applied is the following :$1.- How does it modify the camera's diafragm ?
(Fqinform)$2.- Do you know where is the key for modifying it ?
(Fqif)$1.- Yes, in the left part of the camera (Finfi f +Finfref)$2.- Ok, then press the F3 buttom and move the keytowards the left (Finform)In the model which we are going to present both theexchange structure and the intervention structure are goingto be definied using rewriting rules.
The tree nodes will beenrichied with functional stmcifications just like a lexical-functional grammar.
These functional specifications willreference to the initiative and reactive fimctions which aregoing to appear in the conversation.The grammar initialy will have the following rules :(1) D --> E 1 ............... Ei .............. E n(1" EF1)---J, (T EFi)=~ (T EFn)=$D represents a dialogue, E i the exchange i and EF i thefunctional specification of the exchange i.
(2) E i -> I l 12 (I 3)(T Fx )= $ (T Fy)= $Ij represents he intervention j of exchange E i.Both F x and Fy represent speech acts of the form F(p).That is to say, every node I i will not reflect only thereferential nd predicative aspect of the interation but alsowill express the ilocutive force associated to every speechact.
A single exchange will be constituted for an initiativeintervention a d we could suggest nuclear to the exchange,an initiative-reactive intervention and optionaly for aclosure reactive intervention f the exchange.The functions F x and Fy associated with everyconstituent will be instantiated for some of the initiativeand reactive fimctions introduced before.The rule (2) formulated above handles balancodconversational sequences, that is to my, sequences of thefollowing form :$1(11).- Please, change the exposure mode.$2(12).- I changed it already and 1 have left it inPROGRAM.$1(13_1).- Ok, let us continue, how can 1 change thespeed ?$2(I2).- Press the key XY23 and move the lever.The structural-functional tree which would correspondto this dialogue piece would be the one showed in Fig.
1.Structuraly the dialogue fragment would be constituted bytwo exchanges which inform about the physical actionsperformed by the speaker and which are connected with ahigh level task.Let us imagine that instead of the previous dialoguepiece we produce another one modified a little :$1(11).- Please, change the exposure mode.$2(1"1).- Sorry, how do I change it ?S1(I'2).- Yes, press the buttom MODE and movethe lever on the right side.$2(12).- I changed it already and i have left it inPR 0 GRAM.$1(13).- Ok, let us continue .......This second dialogue illustrates a very commonphenomena, the speaker departs, momentarily, from themain direction of the conversation, in order to start asecondary exchange which, in most cases, will have asubgoal to be achieved, and then returns to the main axisof the convermtion.In order to manager these cases we propose a rule likethis :(3) E i --> I 1 E" i 12t = ~, ( T Ecomp) = .L ( \]" Fy) = .~Fig.
2 shows the dialogue structure obtained by meansof the aplication of the above rule.
We associate theschema 2.a to an exchange which has, like initiativeintervention, a request function of achievement physicalactions.
At the .same time, this function subeategorizes toan subordinate xchange - Ecomp- and a reactiveintervention.We emphasize that the subordinate exchange Ecomphas a retroactive nature so that it would not appear at themoment of the initial formulation of the schema.The schema 2.b is a bit different from the standardnotation of a lexical-functional grammar, it specifies anelement in the left hand side of the nuclear function.
Thiselement will be at the same time the nuclear function ofanother exchange and reflects the subeategorization thatexists between this element and the nuclear constituent ofthe subordinate exchange.The subexchange E"i especified above like E" i --> I" II'2, can have, of course, nested ialogues defined with therule E'i--> I" 1 (E'" i) I" 2.
Iu our corpus we do not findsubdialogues with more than three nested levels veryoften.8147"=1/ " / l~  (t Finfo~,req)ir,~~ tl"!

2 Dialogue structure with subordinate xchanges81,53 PROACTIVE  AND REACTIVEFEATURES IN THE INTERVENTIONAn intervention will be composed by a main act thatwe will designate director act, preceded and/or followed byoption,'d subordinate acts.
The director act is the speech actthat provides the general sense of the intervention, that isto say, its ilocutive force.In all intervention the interactive functions will beexpressed using the proactive or retroactive f atures that wewill associate to the intervention.The following rules define the structure of aninlervcntiou:I i --> (X*) I D (X*)(1" SA)c=+ t =$ (1` SA)c =+X- -> { Ipi , Iri }(1" SAp)=$ (T SAr )=$The first rule defines file hierarchical relation thatexists between the director act (I B) and its subordinate actscoustraiuted by functional equations.
The second ruleidentifies the subordinate act like proactive or retroactive.3,1  Complex  in tervent ions  andcompound in tervent ionsIn most cases, the reactive and proactive features of thesubordinate acts are not related to the director act of theintervention where they appear.
In these cases thesubordinate act must find ils director act in the dialoguesequeuce, basiealy belore, but sometimes it must wait forthe next interventions for its subcategorization.The presence of this phenomena creates the necessity toextend the original model with the inclusiou ofmechanisms which enable to deal with another two newtypes of interventions: the complex interveutions and thecompound interventions.The complex interventious are constituted of two ormore subintcrvcntions with a relation of local domain, thatis to say, the subinterventions make reference to theinitialive fuuction of the exchange more immediate.These interventions will have the followingformulatiou in the modelE --> I l(1" F~)=$Ix --> Ix 1( 1" l,'xl ) = $1 X( 1" lcomp 1) =Ix2$ Fx2) = $The schema ssigned to the exchange inside of which itis the complex intervention will be the following :SCIIEMA = "F l # < {( 1" Fxl ) ( q" Fx2) } ( T Freac ) >"F l subcategorizes to 1,'reac using the initiative function(Fx2) of the complex intervention.The compound interventions are constituted of two ormore subinterventions too, between them there is arelation of non local domain.
In the cases of ploaclivemovement he domain nature will remain defined aposteriori.The compouml interventions will have the followingfolTnulation :E --> I l Iy(1' F I )=$ (i" Icomp )=$ly --> Iy l Iy 2(1" Fy 1)=$ ($ Fy2)=${(~ = g),(1` =~)}The schema assigned It this exchange will be thefollowing :SCIIEMA = T l # < ( $ Fyt) > ( 1" 1,'y2)"The function l:y 2 is subcategorizcd by the function 1" lbut does not support thematic relations wilh it.
Thesefunctions will be rcactives and will have non local domainor proactives which produce a thematic rupture with theinitiative function F 1.We illustrate all this with the lollowing dialoguefragment :S 1.- Now I do not see anythingS 2.- Please, press the shooter half way.S 1.- Where is it ?$2.- Close to the screen, a red buttom do yousee ?$1.-  Yes, yes symbols appear but 1 do notunderstand them.Ilow we can set in Fig.

Thiscomplex intervention is composed of two subintervcntionsof reactive and initiative nalare .
This hlct makes themboth appear between curly-braces pointing out that we aretreating the same intervention.
The presence of theinitiative fimction Fqi f generates the schema 3.3 where theinitiative function is subcategorizcd by the formerinitiative lunction (l:qrcf) and subcategorizcs, at the s~unetime, to the reactive function (Fiufif) that appearsubcategorized in tile former schema.
This functionrepresents an expectation generated fl)r Fqi f in 3.2 and anachievement iu 3.3.The schema 3.3 is related to a compound iulervcutionwhere one of the subinlcrvcnlions plays a reactive roleassociated with the former intervention.
The nextsubintervcntion, reactive too, is non local aud therefore isnot subcategorized fi~r tile nuclear finlction of the schema3.3.
This subinterveutiou is subeategorized for thefunction Fre q of the schema 3.1.

The subcategorizationprocess applies a slruetural schema to every exchangeproducing a functional definition with properlies close tothe semantic forms of tile verbs in a lexical-funetknlalgrammar.The model enables us to handle subordinate xchangcscapluring tile dependencies Ihat exist among the ilocutivef/mctiotls relating tile main function of the exchange totile initiative function of tile subordinate xchange.
Timcomplex and compound interventions make use of timsame mechanism of subcalegorizatiou using Ihe proactiveand relroaclive features of Ihe interventious.The parser has been written ill Pmlog with a bottom-up slrategie.
