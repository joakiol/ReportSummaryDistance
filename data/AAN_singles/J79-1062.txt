Forconsistency, many facts i n  t h e  static knowledqe base also have t h i s  format.This  includes objects such as bacteria and antibiotics,  and attributes suchas  t h e  staininrg characteristics of a bacterium or t h e  recommended dosage ofan antibiot ic  :ATTRIBUTE OBJECT VALUE------.I-- ------ -----GRAM E .COLI GRAMNEGDOSE GENTAMICIN 1.7 mq kg q8h IV (or IM)The remainder of the factual knowledge consists o f  l i s t s  and tables:pieces of aedical knowledge, organized m such a way t h a t  they can be usedt o  augment the  producbion rules.
For example, one such piece of knowledqeis the l ist of the possible culture s i tes  which are normallv nonsterile,NONSTERILESITES : ( CERVIX CUTANEOUS-ULCER LOCHIA NOSE SKINSTOOL THROAT URETHRA VAGINA)The l ikely pathogens associated with the different culture s i t e s  areorganized i n  a table, with different entries for the different s i t e s ,PATH-FLORA-------..--THROAT : (STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE STREPTOCOCCUS-GROUP-A NEISSERI A-MENINGITIDIS )URINE: (E.COLI PSEUDOMONAS ENTEROCOCCUS PROTEUSKLEBSIELLA ENTEROBACTER)SKIN : (STAPHYLOCOCCUS-COAG-POS STREPTOCOCCUS-GROUP-A STAPHYLOCOCCUS-COAG-NEG)CERVIX: ( STREPTOCOCCUS CLOST RIDIUM-GANGRENENEISSERIA-GONORRHA STREPTOCOCCUS-GROUP-A )Production rules can make use of t h i s  tabularized information:RULE058--"-I--If: 1 )  The s i t e  of  the culture is one of :  those sitesthat are normally nonsterile, and2 )  This organism and at least one of t h e  likelypathogens associated with t h e  s i t e  of t h e  c u l t u r eagree wi'th respect to  t h e  following properties:gram morph airThen: There i s  strongly sugaestive evidence (.9) thateach o f  these pathogens is the i d e n t i t v  of theorganismNote that the information i n  t h e  table could have been 0r~anized asattribute-object-value triples (where the object would be a culture site).If t h i s  had been done, however, the above rule could not have been written.To accomplish the same purpose (without a change i n  the  control structure),the svstem would have needed several rules -- a separate one for each entryi n  the table.
Structurinq certain facts into l ists  an.d tables er~ablesindividual product ion rules t o  exDress general theories which allow a numberof specific deduct ions t o  be made.2.2.2 Procedural KnowledgeEach o f  MYCIN'S approximately 400 rules i s  composed of a smallnumber of conceptual primitives.
A total  of  60 such primitives make up thelanguage i n  which rules &re written, This design f a c i l i t a t e d  theimplementation of a mechanisp for translating rules in to  Enql iah ( d e s c r i b e di n  detail i n  171).
Each p r i m i t i v s  functions has a translation template w i t hblanks to  be filled i n  with translations of the function's arquments.
Alarrr;e part of MYCIN'S exolanation c a p a b i l i t v  depends on t h i s  abi l i ty  totranslate rules into a form t h a t  the user can understand.Having a small number of rule components a lso  faci l i tates  theexamination of rules t o  see which might be apnlicable t o  the  explanation a thand.
MYCIN'S knowledge of production ru les ,  therefore, takes t h e  form of  ageneral mechanlsrn for "readinq" rules,  On t h e  o t h e r  hand, no attempt hasbeen made t o  read t h e  code o f  the rule interpreter.
Procedural knowledgeabout the interpreter is embodied i n  n s p e c i a l i s t s u ,  epch capable ofanswerinq a single type o f  question.
Each specialist knows how the re levantpart of the c o n t r o l  structure works and what pieces  of knowledge it  uses.I n  order t o  understand r u l e s ,  the system's various specialists use asmall amount o f  knowledge about rules in general, tosether with descriptionsor templates of each of  the rule components.

Answering t h e s e  q u e s t i o n s  ( F l q u r e  10) i nvo lve sb u i l t - i n  knowledge about  t h e  r u l e  set,  p l u s  t h e  a b i l i t y  t o  tlreadll t h e  rules.By t h e  time t h e  question has been ana lyzed ,  the m e c i a l i s t  knows exactlywhich parameters  must appear  i n  the PREMISE, and which must apDear i n  theACTION of any rule which answers t h e  ques t i on .
Values may be s p e c i f i e d  f o rany of t h e  parameters.
To answer t h e  question, t h e  r u l e - r e t r i e v a l  s p e c i a l i s tmust f i r s t  f i n d  eve ry  rule whose PREMISE and ACTION satisfy t h e s econstraints.
To do t h i s ,  i t  needs t o  know t h a t  there are two special listsassociated with each parameter: one contain in^ every rule that uses theparameter i n  its PREMISE, and the other containinq every rule t h a t  concludesabout the parameter i n  its ACTION.
Using these l ists for  t h e  variousparameters mentioned i n  the quest ion,  the spec ia l i s t  can find those rulesthat  might answer the question.
I f  no values were soecified, the job isdone a n d  t h e  relevant rules can b e  displayed without further anslvsis;otherwise, i t  i s  necessary t o  read each of the rules i n  t he  l ist  and toeliminate those which do n o t  mention the correct values f o r  t h e  ~arameter ,The rule-retrieval specia l is t  also makes use of a piece of MYCIN'Sknowledge which was not discussed ear l ie r .
The system contains models ofi t s  own knowledge (cal led rule models) which are used primarily duringacquisition of new medical knowledge from an expert [4].
These models,however, can be put to many uses -- one is  t o  explain aeneral patterns i ndecision making.
The rule models are abstract  descriptions of a subsets o frules and are generated automatically by readinq the rules.
For  examole,t h e  model for IDENT-IS-PSEUDOMONAS tells what features are common t o  themajority of rules which conclude t h a t  t h e  ident i ty  of an oraanism i spseudomonas .I f  a model exists describing t h e  rules about which the question isasking, t he  rule-retrieval soecialist incorporates t h i s  model's informationi n t o  i t s  answer (Figure 11).
Thus the question-answering facility is ablet o  give some information about s t ra tegies  for achieving some of the svstem'sgoals, as  well as t h e  individual rules which use t h e  s trateqies.

Louis must remove CBCTs at two St. Louis County locations.
The districtcourt said that any one of  the three major services provided by CBCTs consti-tuted branch banking, which is limited in Missouri.In the cases of  the two petitioning Chicago banks, decided by the Federal Courtof Appeals in Illinois last May, all functions performed by CBCTs were deemedto constitute branch banking, which is forbidden in  11,Jinoi.s.However, a Federal District Court in Oklahoma approved all three uses o f  CBCTs,finding terminals "only processors ,Iv and as such legal.
An appeal of the casewas mooted when the.

In a report, titledAdministration of P.

"The report suggested a reexamination sf "the true impact of computers on govern-ment operations."
It raised the question of whether "acquisition of ADPresources is necessary to carry on an essential program, or whether suchacquisition will foster non-essential activity because the computer is available.
"ADP ~ t .

receive a t t e n t h  of top management.
The Committee concludedthat ADP Itcam no longer be viewed as a mere tool, but must now be treated in thesame way as other major programs and, as such, receive top attention of  topmanagement."
The report attributed the basic causes of noncompetitive procure-ments to a lack of: (1) adequate justifications for ADP acquisition; (2)long-range planning; (3) standards ; (4) high level languages ; (5) utilization~euiews; and (6) use of functional specifications.OMB directs GSA to use vfbwtiomZ ADP specifiwtions*.
Responding directly t othe Committee report and other criticisms, OMB Dlrector James T. Lletter last month to GSA Administrator Jack ECkerd, wrote that "[t $a o preclude in athe adverse effects of unduly restrictive specifications, agsncies shall, t othe maximum practical exrent, express their ADP requirements in terms offunctional performance specifications rather than equipment specifications .
"Lynn added: "GSA should strive for expeditious review of agency submissionto avoid delays in the procurement process.
Agencies should cooperate withGSA to  expedite these reviews.
An undue length of time for the normal ADPprocurement process may be considered a disagreement by GSA with the requestof the agency, and may be appealed t o  the Office of Management and Budget.fvConsistent with the poliw expressed herein, any such appeal will be handledexpeditiously, but the burden w i l l  be upon the agency t o  demonstrate the needto specify the particular make or model of equipment or its functionalequivalent when such specification i s  at issue," he said.

He a l so  said that  i f  the d i s t r i c t  court i s  upheld by theappeals court in Cincinnati, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board could appeal tothe Supreme Court.A spokeswoman for the FHLBB in Washington told AFIPS that the FHLBB had nocomment on the case since it is in litigation.
She stated that the New YorkFederal Home Loan Bank ceased providing data processing services prior to thedistrict court ruling, not after the injunction, as Marks contended.NEW CBCT REGULATIONS MAY SANCTION OPERATION OF ,NON-FEDERALLY REGUtATED EFTSTERMINALSActing Comptroller of the Currency Robert Bloom last month announced newcustomer-bank comntunicat ions t erkninal (CBCT) regulations for national banks.The new regulations allow national banks to apply for permission to establishCBCTs as branches in states where state-chartered banRs are permitted toestablish branches.
Bloom's action follows the Supreme Court's refusal toconsider consolidated petitions from two Chicago banks and the Comptroller ofthe Currency seeking review of Federal Appeals Court decisions which equateCBCTs with bank branches and forbid CBCTs in non-branching states (WashingtonR 6 p P t ,  11/76].The Comptroller has unsuccessfully argued in the courts that CBCTs are notbranches, and are not forbidden in states which limit or disallow branching.The trade press suggests that the new regulations may sanction the operationof non-federally regulated EFTS terminals by retailers, shopping mall operatorsfowners of apartment complexes, or operators of transportation terminals.
Thus,the effect of these regulations may be to extend the present list of EFTSilprovidersff beyond financial institutions, i.e., to include what were formerlyon13 EFTS users.The Comptroller's new regulations state that capitalization required for aCBCT branch may now be shared among the participants, thus lowering the cost ofoperating a CBCT, and presumably making CBCTs available to smaller banks withless capital (see Washington Report, 11/76).
Also, in contrast to the $500application fee for a traditional branch, the application fee for a CBCT branchis $200.In the section of the Acting Comptroller's statement, said to sanction operationof non-federally regulated EFTS  terminal^, Bloom held that "any CBCT which isnot established by a national bank .
.
.
is not a branch of a national bani,and not subject to the provisions oftf the applicable section of the federal bankregulation, the McFadden Act, which the courts have held forbids CBCTs in non-branching states .WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES APPOINTMENTS TO PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE ANDTECHNOLOGY -The White House has announced appointments to the President's Committee onScience and-Technology [PCST), which will conduct a two-year review of scienceand technology as it relates to the Federal government.The Coanittee was created by the same legislation [WaehCngtm Report.

Wiley stated his view that acomputer is a comunications device, not a data processing device, when it is usedin a traditional communications service.
However, Wiley also noted that the useof computer technology may result in an enhanced service, offering more thantraditional communications.He predicted that Similar technological forces will develop in several areas ofcommunications service.
Wiley said: "1 firmly believe that, in this grbat freeenterprise society of ours, government regulations must not be permitted to standin the way of thchnological development.
If the new technology creates adminis-trative difficulties for the government, it is the regulations that must beconformed and not the technology.
"According to the FCC chairman, "We will see more instances in the future where,as here, the technology is developing in a manner that blurs traditional inter-faces.
In cases of this sort, the policymakers mu8t have direct access totechnical experts and decisions must be based upon an understanding of thetechnology.Wiley also said, "It is our belief that AFIPS is a particularly appropriateentity to present this conference fur the Commission, in view of the Federation'ssponsorship of the National Computer Conference, and the Joint Comput el' Conferencesprior to that.
Moreover, it is also our view that AFIPS i s  a basically impartialorganization in relation to our policy concerns,bringing to us the objective viewsof a group of highly qualified experts .
'IComputer communieutions aceaunts for 20 per cent of a22 acpenditmes in computgrf ie td .
In the conference I s  first presentation on "Computer Communications ; AnIntroduct $on and Overview ," Lynn Hopewell (chairman, IEEE Computer SocietyTechnical Committee on Computer Communications ; and senior member, executive staff ,Coihputer Sciences Corp.] said that computer communications systems had first beenused in control I i n g ~lcomplexfl operations of industry and government.
Hopewelladded that the most common use of computer commun2cations is in data base applica-t ions.The speaker suggested that the computer communications industry accounts for 20per cent of all expenditures in the computer field, Examples of industrial areasaffected by computer communications technology were listed as law enforcement, se-curities brokerage, insurance, reservations systems and banking.
Hopewell saidthat 75 per cent of the top 500 industry corporations are now using camputercommunications.Distributing samples of a microcomputer-on-a-chip , he noted technological changesthat have produced a 1976 microcomputer CPU costing $20 in contrast to a 1960 IBMCPU costing $30,000.
Hopewell added that microprocessors which cost $20 todaycost $100 only a year ago.
He indicated that such differentials represent onlythe beginning of extremely low cost computing.Hopewell said that the proposed definitions employed in the new "Computer Inquiryffaid in qlclarifying the permitted uses of computers by common carriers, but inno way allow the proposed abandonment of the 'hybrid1 service concept Henoted that the hybrid concept should be retained "because some service offeringshave mixes .ob both computing and communications  function^,^' not because of un-clear definitions.Since "hybrid services will become even more common in the future," Hopewellcontinued, elimination of the hybrid concept will "ineyitably suppress innovationbecause any services that have communication fact ions  inextricably bound intothem will be defined as subject to regulation."
The speaker concluded that hesaw no "technological or economic reason for the regulation of the resale industry.

FCC Interconnection Chief Louis Feldenr , in a question-and-answerperiod following Currants presentation, stressed the Itneed for computer powervf inrural areas.In his formal presentation, Curran continued that the cost of intercontinentaltransmission must also be reduced.
According to the speaker, these measnreswould help to insure that Ifthe common carrier networks can cope with the datacommunications traffic of commercial users.11Curran stated that some of the office and home services associated with computercommunications could require reintegration of voice and data capabilities.

1 January, 19:7WAS1 IINGTON DEVELOPMENTSFEDERAL DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD APPROVED BY COMMERCE DEPARTMENTA data encryption algorithm, designed to protect digital information, wasapproved in November ad a Federal .Information Processing Standard (FIPS)by the Department of Commerce.
The new standard will be described andpromulgated in FIPS PUB 46.The algorithm was first proposed by the Institute for Computer Scienceand Technology (ICST) of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS') in 1973.The encrypt ion algorithm converts informat Ion into -an encoded [C. e. , encrypted)form which can be transmitted or stored, but which cannot be read without theappropriate key.
Thus, it can be used to protect inforfiation communicatedbetween a terminal and a computer, as well as between computers; in addition,it can be used to protect information stored in off-line media.Mandatory stundiud for Federa2 agewies .
As a FIPS, Federal agencies wlllbe requ~red to use the encryption algorithm, whenever encryption of data isdeemed necessary.
However, data subject to the ilu:iona2 Security Act of 1967and the Atomic Enenergy Act of 1952 are exempted from the standard.
Theencryption algorithm may also be used on a voluntary basis by organizationsand individuals outside the Federal government.Primary ini t ial  appJication in EFTS.
The new standard's primary applicationis, initially expected to be in Electronic Funds Transfer Systems [EFTS).
Thealgorithm can be employed in EFTS to discourage l1skinuning" of bank cardinformation for the purpose of gaining access to automated te l ler  machines(ATMs).
It can also be employed to prevent interception of compute1 messagesauthorizing transactions at the ATM.
Several non-standard encryptionalgorithms, including one developed by Diebold, Inc,, are already in use bysome banks.Strength ofaZgcwith estimated.
NBS said technical workshops have been heldto measure the strength of the algorithm in terms of time and money that mustbe spent in finding the key.
In November, a t  the Dartmouth College Symposimon Man and the Computer, ICST Director Dr. Ruth M. Davis stated that, whilego code is ~theordtically unbreakable," 2,500 years of computer tine on ageneral-purpose computer Ilslgnlficantly faster" than a CDC 7600 would berequired to derive a key.
With respect to future technology, Dr. Davisestimated that "working from matched sets of clear and clpher data, well over$300 millionH could be spent five years from now to find a key.
With technologyavailable in 10 years, it could take $70 million t o  derive a key, she said.IBM 'e cr~~ori thm choeen; compan%es to manufauture devices $morporatl'ngc~ta?t.durd thuut  paying royuztiee.
ICST began so l ic i t ing  encryptionalgorithms in 1973 and 1974.
IBM's proposed algorithm was chosen in 1975.While IBM has patent rights in the standard, the company has .agreed togrant royalty-free licenses to other companies which wish to manufacturedevices incorporating the algorithm.
The trade press notes that Motorolaan& Rockwell ~nternational are planning t o  manufacture integrated cirduitchips which incorporate the encryption algorithm.Stundcql -too be pubtished 2/I5/77; oonfepeme echeduted.
PIPS PUB 46 is.expected-to be published February 15, 1977. and to become effective Augrut15, 1977.
Copies of the standard will be available after February 15 fromthe National Technical Informatibn Service (NTIS),  DOC, 5285 Port Royal Roa&Springfield, Virginia 22161, or through the MIPS Washington Office.

pe debate centers on whether the terminal bffering const i tu tesa data communicat~ons service or a data processing service.
If it is a dataconununications service, a s  held in the present donunission ruling, ATGT canprovide the service.
However, if it is a data processing service, as the Chiefof the C ~ m o n  Carrier Bureau stated last March, ATET cannot provide the serviceThe FCC had held earlier in i t s  original lvCompute]r Inquiry" that commoncarriers may pr(wi.de data processing services, but only through unregulatedsubsidiaries.
However, AT&T is  even pre6luded.
Zrom this option by itsagreemept in a 1956 consent decree (with the U.S. Department of Justice) not t oparticipate in unregulated industries.Specif ic  industry criticism.
The independent terminal manhfacturers andcomputer industry groups charged that the development o f  the Dataspeed 40/4terminal is subs id ized  by profi ts  from ATGT's regulated communications serviceofferings.
Thus, they contend that the device represents "unfairff competitionby ATGT against unregulatedb industries.Possible further a e t h .

The contracts, effective December 1, providefor interactive and remote batch proc'essing services &timated at between $50to $80 million over the next year.
Computer Network C o w .
and First Data Corp.rece ived  the first two contracts.The trade press suggeststhat the teleprocessing services program is the f i ~ s tof several steps the Government is implementing to reduee its $10 billion inyearly expenditures on data processing.
For example, the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB], Executive Office of the President,is encouraging greater useof outside service bureaus as well as third-party leasing firms.
In addition,each Federal agency has been d i r e c t e d  by OMB to determine five operations nowbeing performed on its own computers that could be performed on service bureaucomputers.OMB i s  expected to continue ~ t s  moves to cut DP expenses through thetransition t~ the Carter Administration.
@lNSUMER BENEFITS IF EFT TERMINALS ARE NOT CONSIQERED BRANCHES: NCEFTTELLS SENATqMembers of the National Commission on Electronic Fund Transfers [NCEFT) lastmonth told a Senate Subcornittee that the Arner1ea.n consumer "may sufferunnecessary inconveniences and may pay higher prices for payment services"if EFT terminals are governed by the saw, laws and regulations that apply tobank branches.
Such Federal laws equate EFT terminal's wiTh branches thusforbidding EFT terminals in non-brandring states.
[See Wash5ngton Repop**12/76.
)In testimony presented to the Subcommittee on Financial Iristitutions, chairedby Sen. Thomas d .
McIntyre (D-N.H.), NCBFT Chairman William B. Widnall andExecutive Director John 0.
Benton agreed that "[tlhe greatest current impedimentt o  putting into place the technology which can provide the benefits of EFT tothe consumer is the uncertainty which exists about the legal environment withinwllich EFT systems will operate in the future."
The chairman and executivedirector, joined by three NCEFT commissioners, said that a competitiveimbalance is created when federally-chartered savings institutions have greaterfreedom in deploying EFT terminals than national bahks,which are governed bymore restrictive legislation.
The NCEFT representatives+ added that businessenterprises, such as retail chains, "should not be considered , , .
regulatedinstitutions or branches thereof," when they employ electronic terminals tocommunicate with depository institutions.Last month, the NCEFT convened hearings on competition and sharing.
TheCommi$sionfs interim report is due February 23.RGD HAMPERED BY LACK OF COOPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE ENTERPRISE:-"Lack of teamwork between the Government and private enterprise is the numberone bottleneck in the nation's pursuit of research and development," saidDr.
Simon Ramo, vice chairman of the board and chairman of TRW, Inc. Speakinglast November in Washington at the annual f a l l  meeting of the National Academyof Engineering, Dr. Ramo added, "Even the nation's most capable researchersspend much of their time defending their selection of projects and describingpotential results, rather than in carrying on research.
We are persisting inthis tendency even with growing indications that the U.S. is losing its leader-ship position as to the fraction of gross national product being devoted to basicresearch."
The TRW Executive, who is also chairman of the President * s  Scienceand Technology Committee,expressed the hope that the new Office of Science andTechnology Policy, Executive Office of the President, will contribute to theformation of llsoundlt national policy.ASST.
COMMERCE SECKETARY RECOMMENDS USPS COMPROMISE ON-PAGE CHARGES FOR NON-PROFIT SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, AND TECHNICAL JOURNALS AND PERIODICALSThe U.S.
Postal Service (USPS) is ItwillSng to modify1' the USPS regulationrequiring reading matter in all non-profit, second class publications to  bemarked ~ladvertisementv when contributors are required to pay page charges ontheir submissions, Dr .
Betsy Ancker-Johnson, the Department of CommercetsAssistant Secretary for Science and Technology, last month said the USPS isl lwill ing to modify the regulation so long as contributions to publishing costsarenlt mandatary but vol~ntary.~'Convening a meeting last month of the Committee on In te l lec tua l  Property andInformation, Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering andTechnology, Dr. Anclcer- Johnson, committee chairman, indicated that thisvoluntary arrangement should be clarified in the publicationts masthead.The regulation could affect the  policy of AFIPS constituent societies whichmust publish a non-profit j ournal as one qualification for membership.Page charges, paid by researchers, are viewed by journal publishers as onemethod of defraying the cost of reporting research.
In many cases, pagecharges are paid by funds obtained through research grants.
Charges may bevoluntary,far example, with researchers who are not supported by grants.Dr.
Bernard Forscher, managing editor of the National Academy of Sciences'Prooasdhgs, suggested in an interview with AFlPS Washington Report, that pagecharges should be considered i n  research budgets.
D r .
Forscher compared publi-cation of research findings with "staking a claim t o  a d i s c ~ v e r y , ~ ~  o r  "obtaininga deed."
Forty per cent of the production costs of the ProoeedjnSs are defrayedthrough page charges; the remaining 60 per cent is covered by sales ofsubscriptions as well as repr in ts  and back issues, he said.The meeting of the Committee on In te l lec tua l  Property and- Information wasattended by rep~esentatives of IEEE, the  National Science Foundation, theAmerican Astronomical Society, as well as AFIPS and others.
A representativeof the Federation of American Societ ies i n  Experimental Biology said  that thes c i e n t i f i c  community,will not accept the compromise solution.
He indicated thatunless page charges ire mandatory, they "won1 t work.
The biology society'srepresentative recommended a special exemption from the regulation f o r  s c i e n t i f i cj ournails .The counsel for the National Academy o f  Sciences agreed that pa e charges cannotbe voluntary.
He said "those who now pay must contlnue [to pay f or seriousproblems [ w i l l  arise]."
He stated that scientific j o u q a l  ar t i c l e s  are Itasdeserving of second-class [mailing privileges] as anything tha t  goes through themail, "There was, however, somq support for the USPS compromise.
One society repre-sentative suggested that attendance a t  the meeting, re f lec t ing  opposition t othe voluntary page charges, was not representative of most professional socie t iesviews.Ancker-Johnson stated that her committee could tlmonitorlf cases brought to itsattention and ac t  as "brokersv in situations in which voluntary payments, onceagreed to, werenot made.
She confirmed t h a t  the compromise is about t o  be puti n  writing (#I by USPS counsel.Ancker-Johnson suggested that further comments concerning the  regulation andthe  proposed compromise be directed t o  her i n  Room 3862, DOC.

AFIPS Washington Report described responses of some members ofan AFIPS panel on private sector usage of the Social Security Number (SSN)to a position paper on this subject issued by the Privacy Protection StudyCommission.

Perry, director of EDPand Research, the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), Orlando, Florida.Credit Bureau President White wrote: "Since one of CBI's primary obligationsis to maintain the confidentiality of the informatibn in its data base, wewould be opposed to any general prohibitions against the use of the SocialSecurity Number in the private sector.
While CBI does not use this number asa universal identif ier or as a sole factor in the identification or authenti-cation process, it is an aid in maintaining confidentiality in a small numberof cases.
Therefore, eliminating the use of the Social Security Number wouldhave an adverse impact on our ability to serve the consumer and the creditgranting community.Bxxon Section Head Moore wrote:  he presence of the SSN in the recordconstitutes unique identification and restricting its use as a formal recordidentifier would serve no useful purpose," Ohio University Data ProcessingDirector Dalzell said: "I would question whether the individual's knowledgeand consent should be s complete qualifier.
