Likewise, n-gram models can be cap-tured by finite-state acceptors, which can be re-used across applications.It is possible to mix, match, and compose trans-ducers to flexibly solve all kinds of problems.
Onesuch problem is transliteration, which can be mod-eled as a pipeline of string transformations.
MThas also been modeled with transducers, and de-scendants of the FSM toolkit are now used to im-plement phrase-based machine translation.
Evenspeech recognizers and MT systems can them-selves be composed to deliver speech-to-speechMT.The main rub with finite-state string MT is wordre-ordering.
Tree transducers offer a natural mech-anism to solve this problem, and they have re-cently been employed with some success.In this talk, we will survey these ideas (and theirorigins), and we will finish with a discussion ofhow transliteration and MT can work together.27
