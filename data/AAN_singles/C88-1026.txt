Box 704Yorktown lteights, NY 10598USAAbstractIn this paper I propose a Binding rule for the iden-tification of pronoun and anaphor referents inphrase-structure trees, assuming the general frame-work of lhe Government-binding theory outlinedby Chom,;ky (1981).
The Binding rule, specified bymeans of an attribute grammar, is a particularinstantiation of the Free Indexing rule and bindingaxioms in Chomsky's Binding theory, with certainempirical and practical advantages.
The complexi-ties of the Binding rule proposed, as well as thatinherent in Chomsky's Binding theory, are studied,and it i~ shown that the new rule is morepsychologically plausible and cornputationally effi-cient than the original theory on wtfich it is based.The fragment of the attribute grammar shown hereis part of an English grammar and parser beingdeveloped in tile Prolog and PLNLP languages.IntroductionBinding is a component subtheory of Government-binding which applies in the derivation of thelogical form of utterances from their surface rcpre-sentation.
The area of semantic interpretation dealtwith by the binding theory is that of anaphora.Binding theory defines only syntactic onditions onanaphora; the reader is referred to /Hobbs, 1978/for some of the extra-syntactic factors that might beinvolved.
Binding assumes an Indexing rule whichapplies to an input S-Structure tree and annotatesit, assigning to every NP node ha the input tree areferential index, which represents the corefereneerelation ot the NP with other NPs in the input.In this paper research is continued on the use ofattribute grammars to provide a fully explicit andcomputationally oriented statement of theGovernmc.nt-binding (GB) theory /Correa, 1987/.The Binding rule presented here improves over thestandard statement of the Binding theory in tworespects: From an empirical point of view, the newrule accounts for crossover binding phenomena/Kuno, 1987/ without recourse to reconstruction/Chomsky, 1981/; from a practical point of view,the new rule is more computationally sensible thanthe generate-and-test approach understood inChomsky's theory, and hence is a plausible candi-date for incorporation in natural-language parsersthat account ot anaphora.
Previous literature onGB parsing /Wehrli, 1984; Sharp, 1985; Kashket,1986; Kuhns, 1986; Abney, 1986/has not addressedthe issue of implementation of the Binding theory)The present paper intends in part to fill this gap.In the development below I will assume that thereader is thmiliar with attribute grammars and thebasic concepts and terminology of Government-binding, although not necessarily with the Bindingtheory.
The reader is referred to Waite and Goos(1984) for a concise introduction to attribute gram-mars, and Sells (1985) for the basic assumptions ofGovernment-binding.Chomsky's Binding Theol TBinding theory defines the syntactic onstraints oncoreferenee that exist between the noun phrases ina sentence.
In the course ot" doing this, thE themyindirectly determines constraints on the distributionof certain kinds of noun phrases.
In this section wereview the standard formulation of the Bindingtheory; tile reader already familiar with it mayproceed to the next section.The ret~rential possibilities of a noun phrasedepend on the fimetional type of the NP and theBinding conditions for that type.
Government-binding distinguishes three types of overt NP,shown in (1).I Sharp (1985) checks correclness of binding in traces; we consider lexical NPs here.123O) a. anaphor (reflexive and reciprocal)b. pronominalc.
referentialAn anaphor is an expression that has no inde-pendent reference mad must take its reference fromsome other expression in the sentence in which itoccurs.
English has reflexive and reciprocalanaphors, such as 'themselves' and "each other" in(2).
The NP from which an anaphor or pronom-inal takes its reference is called its antecedent, sincean anaphor must have an antecedent within thesentence in which it is used, we obtain the contrastbetween (2.a) and (2.b).
If there is no appropriateantecedent, the string is ill-formed at the LogicalForm level.
The antecedent of the anaphor must,furthermore, c-command the anaphor and be foundwithin a certain local domain, notions to be madeprecise below.
Thus, in (2.c), although there is apotential antecedent for the anaphor, namely'Greeks', it is not within the required local domain.In (2.d), there is a potential antecedent "donkey',but it does not c-command the anaphor.
Hence:i~e string is also ill-formed.
(2) a. Greeks like themselves/each other.b.
* Each other/Themselves like Greeks.c.
* Greeks i think that each otheq/themselves iare smart.d.
* Every man who owns a donkey i beatsitself.A pronominal is a pronoun in any of its inflectedforms (e.g., as due to agreement and Case-marking), as in (3).
Pronominals exhibit a distrib-ution in phrase structure trees nearlycomplementary to that of anaphors.
A pronominalneed not pick its reference from some other NP inthe sentence, but rather may have independent(deictie) interpretation, as in the first reading of(3.a).
The pronominal may also be readanaphorically, having its reference determined bysome other NP in the sentence (3.a-b).
In tlfiscase, though, the antecedent must either be outsidethe local domain of the pronominal, or notc-command it.
Hence, the assigned coreference in(3.a-b) is possible, while that in (3.c) is not.Within a local domain, where an anaphor musthave an antecedent, a pronominal cannot.
(3) a. Brigitte i said that Shell i is tired.b.
Every man who owns a donkey i beats it i.c.
* Sibylle i loves her i.Lexical or fully referential expressions are nameslike "John" and "the man" in (4); the class inchldesall nominals headed by a common or proper noun.A referential expression defines its reference inde-pendently and must be free in every domain, in thesense that it may not have a c-commandingantecedent.
Tiros the interpretations in (4.a-b) areunwarranted.
Coreference between referential NPsis possible only if the first NP does not c-commandthe second (4.c-d); the result, though, may beawkward or place emphasis on the anaphoric nounphrase.
(4) a.
* John i likes John i.b.
* .lohn i wants that John i leaves.c.
The man who hired John i likes .lohn i.d.
John i came and .lohn i left.The most difficult area of the Binding theory is thetbrmulation of the notion local domain referred toabove.
This notion is defined such that it is iden-tical for anaphors and pronouns.
We note inadvance, however, that while the notion is nearlyidentical for both, it should not be defined thesame, as sentences (5.a-b) show (Chomsky, 1986).In this paper we shall not be concerned with thesolution of this still open problem.
(~ a.
The children i like each other'sipictures.b.
The children i like theiq pictures.Chomsky's axiomatic statement of the Bindingtheory is as tollows.
Chomsky (1981) assumes aFree Indexing rule which appfies at LF and assigns(randomly) a referential index to every NP in timinput structure.
Two NPs are said to becoreferential if they bear the same referential index.The indexhlg rule massively overgenerates logicalforms, and indiscriminately assigns unwarrantedcoreference relations.
The annotated structttresproduced by the rule are subject to a number ofwell-formedness conditions, which are constraintson the assigned coreference r lations.The most elementary condition is the agreementconditkm (6).
The main component of the theoryis given by the Binding axioms (7), where timnotions of binding and local domain are as in (8)and (9), respectively.
Notice that the definition (9)of local domain does not distinguish betweenanaphors and pronominals, and thus is problem-atic, as the examples (5) indicate.
We assume thisdefinition, though, for the development below.The notion of c-command used in (8) is given in(10),124(6) Agreement ConditionIf NP l and NP2 are coindexed, then theiragreement features A GR = < Person, Gender,Number> agree.
(7) Binding Axioms(8)(9)A.
An anapkor must be bound within itslocal domain.B.
A pronomb,al must be free within its localdomain.C.
A referential expression must be free inevery domain.For nodes a and fl, a binds \[1 if (i) a iscoindexed with fl, and (ii) a c-commands ft.A node a is free (within a given domain) if itis not bound (within that domain).The local domain of a node a is the subtreedominated by MGC(a),  whereMGC(~),  the minimal governing category ofa, denotes the maximal projection # nearestto ?z such that/~ dominates a, and/~ has an accessible Subject, and/L dominates a governor ~ of a(to) For nodes a and \[1, a e-commands \[I if thefirsi; branching node dominating a also domi-nates ft.It is a straightforward task to verify that theBinding axioms in (7) explain the grammaticalityjudgements and interpretation possibilities of theexamples presented thus far, except those in (5).The theory is explanatorily adequate, in the sensethat it applies to a wide range of natural anguages.Procedt~ral BindingThe Binding theory just outlined follows the styleof most recent work within the Government-binding framework.
Extremely general rules, suchas the Free Indexing rule, are assumed for the gen-eration and annotation of syntactic structure; thebulk of the grammar then consists of well-formedness conditions or axioms that must be sat-isfied by the generated structures.
This approach:due to it:; extreme inefficiency, is problematic as amodel of linguistic performance or natural anguageparsing.
It seems more appropriate to view thegeneral rules and axioms that constrain them asIfigh-level specifications of certain grammaticalprocesses, rather than as models of how the proc-esses are actually carried out.The refinement of the general rules and axiomsassociated with them into procedural rules whichmay be used to derive structure that already satis-fies the axioms is not a straightforward task, andhas only recently begun to be addressed /Abneyand Cole, 1986; Barton, 1984/.
The incorporationof axioms into the rules leads to grammars whichare more sensitive to psychological issues/linguisticprocessing, rather than mere linguistic description.It seems clear that only these new rules may beused in practical natural anguage parsers.
Further-more, the formulation of procedural mechanismsprovides a new way of looking at linguistic phe-nomena, which may in turn lead to insights for thesolution of outstanding problems.
I offer the fol-lowing Binding rule as an illustration.The Binding rule is defined by means of attributionrules associated with productions in the base.
Itapplies at S-Structure and assigns to each NP nodein the structure a referential index, in such way thatthe Binding axioms are satisfied by the assignment.The generate-and-test method implicit inChomsky's account is avoided.
In thoseS-Structures for which there is no possible correctassignment, ile rule blocks, and the structures aremarked ill-formed, due to some violation of the13inding theory.
The rule applies after the time-tional type of every NP has been determined,according to lexical features of the head nominaland principles of the Government and Case theo-ries.
Functional classification of an NP consists ofdetermining the values of its attributes anapkoricand pronominal /van Riemsdijk and Williams,1986/.
The first approximation to the rule islimited to cases of backward reference only; assign-ment of forward eoreference, as in (IlL will not becovered by the rule.
Also, we ignore cases wherereferential expresskms may be used anaphorically,as in (4.c-d).
(i I) Men who met her i saw how kind Mary i was.The formulation of the rule relies crucially on thefollowing hypothesis: For every NP node in anS-Structure, it is possible to define two sets ofnominal expressions AAS and PAS, which contain,respectively, potential anaphoric and pronominalantecedents.
Given a mechanism to compute thetwo sets noted, an antecedent for the current nodemay be selected from the appropriate set, accordingto the current node's functional type, as in (12).Attribution rule (12) is associated with every pro-duetion for NP and defines the value of the NP'sreferential index.
The function se&ct-from takes anordered set as argument and selects (arbitrarily) the125first element hat morphologically agrees with theNP2(J2) Binding Rule:NP.Reflndex ,-if NP.anaphoric thenif N P .pronominal then / * Control* /else select-from( AA S)else if NP.pronominalthen seleet-from(PAS)else NP.nodeThe main component of the Binding rule consistsof the attribution rules that define the values of theAAS and PAS sets at each node.
I now proceed todescribe the types of the attributes involved in thecomputation and the manner in which these valuesare defined.Binding attributes and their typesAssume integer-valued attributes node andRe/Index.
The attribute node is associated withevery node in an S-Structure tree, enumeratingthem in preorder.
Thus the node number of an NPmay be used to identify the NP.
Reflndex repres-ents the referential index of the NP with which it isassociated.
This attribute is synthesized by rule(12) and its value is equal to the referential index ofthe first NP with which the current NP corefers(assuming a preorder enumeration of tree nodes).When NP.RefIndex = NP.node, for some NP, wesay the NP has independent reference.The attribute AAS contains, for a given NP, thesequence of c-commanding NPs found within thelocal domain of the current node.
Thus, any NP inthis set is a potential antecedent for the currentnode, if that node is anaphoric.
Each element inthe AAS is a pair of the form < NP.Reflndex,NP.AGR >, for some NP to the left of the currentnode.
NPs are ordered in the AAS in such way thatthe most recently found NP is ranked first (AAS isa stack, or ordered set).
The attribute IMS issimilar to the AAS, except that each element in iteither does not c-command the current node, or isoutside its local domain.
Thus, each NP in thePAS is a potential antecedent for the current node,if that node is pronominal.An important difference between the AAS and PASis that, if the current node is an NP, say NPi, thepair < NPi.node, NPi.AGR > is a member of PAS,but not AAS.
Because of this, a pronominal's ref-erential index may be set to its own node number(i.e., may be interpreted deictically), while ananaphor's may not.
This difference between theAAS and PAS need not be stipulated as a specialcase, but rather follows naturally if we assume thec-command relation is irreflexive.The distribution of values tor the AAS and PASattributes in an SoStructure may be illustrated hymeans of example (13), ill which the subscripts areNP node numbers; we ignore their actual values.
(13) John h told \[his i parents\]j about himself k.The values that result for the AAS and PAS areshown in (14); the reader may verify their correct-hess with the aid of .examples (15).
For the tirstNP, "John', there is no potential anaphoricantecedent (15.a), so the AAS is empty (14.a).Ilowever, at that position it is possible to have afree pronoun, so the PAS contains a single erthy,the pair <h, AGRh>.
For the second NP, "his',the values of AAS and PAS are as in (14.b).
Thusthe AAS is empty and no anaphor is permissible atthe position (15.b), while a pronoun is, in whichcase it may be interpreted deictically oranaphorically, referring back to "John'.
The valuesof the AAS and PAS attributes associated with NP iand NP k are as shown in (14.c-d).
(14) a.. NPh.AAS = { }NPh.PAS = { < h,AGR h > }b. NPi .AAS = { }NPi.PAS = { < i,AGRj >, < h,AGR~ > }c. NPi .AAS = { <h,AGRh> }NPj.PAS = { <.\],AGRj > )d. NPk.AAS = { <j,AGRi> , <h,AGRh> }NPk.PAS = ( <k,AGR k>, <i,AGR i >}(1~ a.
* Himself/ He i told his parents abouthimself.b.
Jolm i told \[*himself s~ hisj/i pa.rents\] ahouthimself.c.
John i told himself/ *him i to stop smoking.t c. John i told \[Mary: s parents\]k abouthimself/each otherk/ tler~/i2' No theoretical significance is attached to the order of' the elements in the AAS and PAS.
Psycholinguisticevidence, however, suggests hat gaps "reactivate" their antecedents, which hears on the order of the sets.126The attr ibut ion rulcx i.ii;tt dcihw, i.liC v~t!O,'::~ ~+{ \[i+<.

The rule~rovides a correct account of backward reference ofqPs, and also of forward reference due to move-nent, without recourse to reconstruction.
The rule~resents a model of Binding in which sets of poten-ial anaphoric and pronominal antecedents arencrementally defined at each node in a tree.
;torage use may be optimized by use of global'.torage cells, as described by/Sonnenschein, 1985/.n more general terms, tiffs rule presents a trend:omplementary to that of recent linguistic theory.Fhe rule formulation indicates how conditions on'eprescntations may be incorporated into the ruless, hich generate the representations i  the first place.I'his leads to grammars more geared to linguistic~rocessing, and to which a higher degree of "psy-:hological reality" may be ascribed.
The rule is aikely candidate for incorporation in natural lan-guage parsers.AcknowledgementsI would like to thank my dissertation advisorsSusumu Kuno and .laklin Komfilt for discussion ofBinding, George Ileidorn and Karen .lensen, whoread an earlier version of tiffs paper, and Dr.Edward Stabler at Syracuse University for longthne support of my dissertation project.
