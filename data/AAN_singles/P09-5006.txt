The importance ofthis task is directly amplified by the field of Natu-ral Language Processing (NLP) currently movingtowards high-level linguistic tasks requiring NLUcapabilities such as e.g.
recognizing textual entail-ment.
This tutorial aims at providing the NLPcommunity with a gentle introduction to the taskof coreference resolution from both a theoreticaland an application-oriented perspective.
Its mainpurposes are: (1) to introduce a general audienceof NLP researchers to the core ideas underlyingstate-of-the-art computational models of corefer-ence; (2) to provide that same audience with anoverview of NLP applications which can benefitfrom coreference information.2 Content Overview1.
Introduction to machine learning approachesto coreference resolution.
We start by focusingon machine learning based approaches developedin the seminal works from Soon et al (2001) andNg & Cardie (2002).
We then analyze the mainlimitations of these approaches, i.e.
their cluster-ing of mentions from a local pairwise classifica-tion of nominal phrases in text.
We finally moveon to present more complex models which attemptto model coreference as a global discourse phe-nomenon (Yang et al, 2003; Luo et al, 2004;Daume?
III & Marcu, 2005, inter alia).2.
Lexical and encyclopedic knowledge forcoreference resolution.
Resolving anaphors totheir correct antecedents requires in many caseslexical and encyclopedic knowledge.
We accord-ingly introduce approaches which attempt to in-clude semantic information into the coreferencemodels from a variety of knowledge sources,e.g.
WordNet (Harabagiu et al, 2001), Wikipedia(Ponzetto & Strube, 2006) and automatically har-vested patterns (Poesio et al, 2002; Markert &Nissim, 2005; Yang & Su, 2007).3.
Applications and future directions.
Wepresent an overview of NLP applications whichhave been shown to profit from coreference in-formation, e.g.
question answering and summa-rization.
We conclude with remarks on futurework directions.
These include: a) bringing to-gether approaches to coreference using semanticinformation with global discourse modeling tech-niques; b) exploring novel application scenarioswhich could potentially benefit from coreferenceresolution, e.g.
relation extraction and extractingevents and event chains from text.ReferencesDaume?
