Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lap (UKP-DIPF)German Institute for Educational Research and Educational Informationwww.ukp.tu-darmstadt.deAbstractWe present a new bilingual FrameNet lex-icon for English and German.
It is cre-ated through a simple, but powerful ap-proach to construct a FrameNet in anylanguage using Wiktionary as an inter-lingual representation.
Our approach isbased on a sense alignment of FrameNetand Wiktionary, and subsequent transla-tion disambiguation into the target lan-guage.
We perform a detailed evaluationof the created resource and a discussion ofWiktionary as an interlingual connectionfor the cross-language transfer of lexical-semantic resources.
The created resourceis publicly available at http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/fnwkde/.1 IntroductionFrameNet is a valuable resource for natural lan-guage processing (NLP): semantic role labeling(SRL) systems based on FrameNet provide se-mantic analysis for NLP applications, such asquestion answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu,2004; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005) and informationextraction (Mohit and Narayanan, 2003).
How-ever, their wide deployment has been prohibitedby the poor coverage and limited availability of asimilar resource in many languages.Expert-built lexical-semantic resources are ex-pensive to create.
Previous cross-lingual trans-fer of FrameNet used corpus-based approaches, orresource alignment with multilingual expert-builtresources, such as EuroWordNet.
The latter in-directly also suffers from the high cost and con-strained coverage of expert-built resources.Recently, collaboratively created resources havebeen investigated for the multilingual extension ofresources in NLP, beginning with Wikipedia (Nav-igli and Ponzetto, 2010).
They rely on the so-called ?Wisdom of the Crowds?, contributions bya large number of volunteers, which results in acontinuously updated high-quality resource avail-able in hundreds of languages.
Due to the ency-clopedic nature of Wikipedia, previous work fo-cused on encyclopedic information for Wikipediaentries, i.e., almost exclusively on nouns.This is not enough for resources like FrameNet.Such resources need lexical-semantic informationon various POS.
For FrameNet, information onthe predicates associated with a semantic frame ?mostly verbs, nouns, and adjectives ?
is crucial,for instance gloss or syntactic subcategorization.A solution for the problem of multilingual ex-tension of lexical semantic resources is to useWiktionary, a collaboratively created dictionary,as connection between languages.
It provideshigh-quality lexical information on all POS, for in-stance glosses, sense relations, syntactic subcate-gorization, etc.
Like Wikipedia, it is continuouslyextended and contains translations to hundreds oflanguages, including low-resource ones.
To ourknowledge, Wiktionary has not been evaluated asan interlingual index for the cross-lingual exten-sion of lexical-semantic resources.In this paper, we present a novel method forthe creation of bilingual FrameNet lexicons basedon an alignment to Wiktionary.
We demonstrateour method on the language pair English-Germanand present the resulting resources, a lemma-basedmultilingual and a sense-disambiguated German-English FrameNet lexicon.The understanding of lexical-semantic re-sources and their combinations, e.g., how align-ment algorithms can be adapted to individual re-source pairs and different POS, is essential fortheir effective use in NLP and a prerequisite forlater in-task evaluation and application.
To en-hance this understanding for the presented re-source pair, we perform a detailed analysis ofthe created resource and compare it to existingFrameNet resources for German.1363The contributions of our work are the following:(1) We create a novel sense alignment betweenFrameNet and the English Wiktionary.
It resultsin a multilingual FrameNet FNWKxx, which linksFrameNet senses to lemmas in 280 languages.
(2)We create a sense-disambiguated English-GermanFrameNet lexicon FNWKde based on FNWKxxand translation disambiguation on the GermanWiktionary.1 (3) We analyze the two resourcesand outline further steps for creating a multilin-gual FrameNet.This is a major step towards the vision of thispaper: a simple, but powerful approach to partiallyconstruct a FrameNet in any language using Wik-tionary as an interlingual representation.2 Resource OverviewFrameNet (Baker et al, 1998) is an expert-builtlexical-semantic resource incorporating the theoryof frame-semantics (Fillmore, 1976).
It groupsword senses in frames that represent particular sit-uations.
Thus, the verb complete and the nouncompletion belong to the Activity finish frame.
Theparticipants of these situations, typically realizedas syntactic arguments, are the semantic roles ofthe frame, for instance the Agent performing an ac-tivity, or the Activity itself.
FrameNet release 1.5contains 1,015 frames, and 11,942 word senses.Corpus texts annotated with frames and their roleshave been used to train automatic SRL systems.Wiktionary is a collaboratively created dictio-nary available in over 500 language editions.
It iscontinuously extended and revised by a commu-nity of volunteer editors.
The English languageedition contains over 500,000 word senses.2Wiktionary is organized like a traditional dic-tionary in lexical entries and word senses.
For theword senses, definitions and example sentences, aswell as other lexical information, such as register(e.g., colloquial), phonetic transcription, inflec-tion may be available, including language-specifictypes of information.
Senses also provide trans-lations to other languages.
These are connectedto lexical entries in the respective language edi-tions via hyperlinks.
This allows us to use Wik-tionary as an interlingual connection between mul-tiple languages.1The xx in FNWKxx stands for all the languages in theresource.
After translation disambiguation in a specific lan-guage, xx is replaced by the corresponding language code.2as of May 2013, see http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Statistics.Figure 1: Method overview.The quality of Wiktionary has been confirmedby Meyer and Gurevych (2012b) who also give anoverview on the usage of Wiktionary in NLP ap-plications such as speech synthesis.3 Method OverviewOur method consists of two steps visualized inFig.
1.
In the first step, we create a novel sensealignment between FrameNet and the EnglishWiktionary following Niemann and Gurevych(2011).
Thus, the FrameNet sense of to completewith frame Activity finish is assigned to the senseof to complete in Wiktionary meaning to finish.This step establishes Wiktionary as an interlin-gual index between FrameNet senses and lemmasin many languages, and builds the foundation forthe bilingual FrameNet extension.It results in a basic multilingual FrameNet lexi-con FNWKxx with translations to lemmas in 283languages.
An example: by aligning the FrameNetsense of the verb complete with gloss to finishwith the corresponding English Wiktionary sense,we collect 39 translations to 22 languages, e.g., theGerman fertigmachen and the Spanish terminar.The second step is the disambiguation of thetranslated lemmas with respect to the target lan-guage Wiktionary in order to retrieve the lin-guistic information of the corresponding wordsense in the target language Wiktionary (Meyerand Gurevych, 2012a).
We evaluate this stepfor English and German and create the bilingualFrameNet lexicon FNWKde.
For the examplesense of complete, we extract lexical informationfor the word sense of its German translation fer-tigmachen, for instance a German gloss, an ex-ample sentence, register information (colloquial),and synonyms, e.g., beenden.
As a side-benefit ofour method, we also extend the English FrameNetby the linguistic information in Wiktionary.13644 Related Work4.1 Creating FrameNets in New LanguagesThere are two main lines of research in bootstrap-ping a FrameNet for languages other than English.The first, corpus-based approach is to automat-ically extract word senses in the target languagebased on parallel corpora and frame annotationsin the source language.
In this vein, Pado?
andLapata (2005) propose a cross-lingual FrameNetextension to German and French; Johansson andNugues (2005) and Johansson and Nugues (2006)do this for Spanish and Swedish, and Basili et al(2009) for Italian.Pado?
and Lapata (2005) observe that their ap-proach suffers from polysemy errors, because lem-mas in the source language need to be disam-biguated with respect to all the frames they evoke.To alleviate this problem, they use a disambigua-tion approach based on the most frequent frame;Basili et al (2009) use distributional methods forframe disambiguation.
Our approach is based onsense alignments and therefore explicitly aims toavoid such errors.The second line of work is resource-based:FrameNet is aligned to multilingual resources inorder to extract senses in the target language.
Us-ing monolingual resources, this approach has alsobeen employed to extend FrameNet coverage forEnglish (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005; Johansson andNugues, 2007; Ferrandez et al, 2010).De Cao et al (2008) map FrameNet framesto WordNet synsets based on the embedding ofFrameNet lemmas in WordNet.
They use Multi-WordNet, an English-Italian wordnet, to induce anItalian FrameNet lexicon with 15,000 entries.To create MapNet, Tonelli and Pianta (2009)align FrameNet senses with WordNet synsets byexploiting the textual similarity of their glosses.The similarity measure is based on stem overlap ofthe candidates?
glosses expanded by WordNet do-mains, the WordNet synset, and the set of sensesfor a FrameNet frame.
In Tonelli and Pighin(2009), they use these features to train an SVM-classifier to identify valid alignments and reportan F1-score of 0.66 on a manually annotated goldstandard.
They report 4,265 new English sensesand 6,429 new Italian senses, which were derivedvia MultiWordNet.ExtendedWordFramenet (Laparra and Rigau,2009; Laparra and Rigau, 2010) is also basedon the alignment of FrameNet senses to Word-Net synsets.
The goal is the multilingual cover-age extension of FrameNet, which is achieved bylinking WordNet to wordnets in other languages(Spanish, Italian, Basque, and Catalan) in the Mul-tilingual Central Repository.
For each language,they add more then 10,000 senses to FrameNet.They rely on a knowledge-based word sense dis-ambiguation algorithm to establish the alignmentand report F1=0.75 on a gold standard based onTonelli and Pighin (2009).Tonelli and Giuliano (2009) align FrameNetsenses to Wikipedia entries with the goal to ex-tract word senses and example sentences in Ital-ian.
Based on Wikipedia, this alignment is re-stricted to nouns.
Subsequent work on Wikipediaand FrameNet follows a different path and tries toenhance the modeling of selectional preferencesfor FrameNet predicates (Tonelli et al, 2012).Finally, there have been suggestions to com-bine the corpus-based and the resource-based ap-proaches: Borin et al (2012) do this for Finnishand Swedish.
They prove the feasibility oftheir approach by creating a preliminary FinnishFrameNet with 2,694 senses.Mouton et al (2010) directly exploit the trans-lations in the English and French Wiktionary edi-tions to extend the French FrameNet.
They matchthe FrameNet senses to Wiktionary lexical en-tries, thus encountering the problem of polysemyin the target language.
To solve this, they de-fine a set of filters that control how target lemmasare distributed over frames, increasing precision atthe expense of recall (P=0.74, R=0.3, F1=0.42).While their approach is in theory applicable toother languages, our approach goes beyond thisby laying the ground for simultaneous FrameNetextension in multiple languages via FNWKxx.4.2 Wiktionary Sense AlignmentsCollaboratively created resources have becomepopular for sense alignments for NLP, start-ing with the alignment between WordNet andWikipedia (Ruiz-Casado et al, 2005; Ponzettoand Navigli, 2009).
Wiktionary has been subjectto few alignment efforts: de Melo and Weikum(2009) integrate information from Wiktionary intoUniversal WordNet.
Meyer and Gurevych (2011)map WordNet synsets to Wiktionary senses andshow their complementary domain coverage.13655 FrameNet ?
Wiktionary Alignment5.1 Alignment TechniqueWe follow the state-of-the-art sense alignmenttechnique introduced by Niemann and Gurevych(2011).
They align senses in WordNet toWikipedia entries in a supervised setting using se-mantic similarity measures.One reason to use their method was that it al-lows zero alignments or one-to-many alignments.This is crucial for obtaining a high-quality align-ment of heterogeneous resources, such as the pre-sented one, because their sense granularity andcoverage can diverge a lot.The alignment algorithm consists of two steps.In the candidate extraction step, we iterate over allFrameNet senses and match them with all sensesfrom Wiktionary which have the same lemma andthus are likely to describe the same sense.This step yields a set of candidate sense pairsCall.
In the classification step, a similarity scorebetween the textual information associated withthe senses in a candidate pair (e.g., their gloss) iscomputed and a threshold-based classifier decidesfor each pair on valid alignments.Niemann and Gurevych (2011) combine twodifferent types of similarity (i) cosine similarityon bag-of-words vectors (COS) and (ii) a person-alized PageRank-based similarity measure (PPR).The PPR measure (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) mapsthe glosses of the two senses to a semantic vec-tor space spanned up by WordNet synsets and thencompares them using the chi-square measure.The semantic vectors ppr are computed us-ing the personalized PageRank algorithm on theWordNet graph.
They determine the importantnodes in the graph as the nodes that a randomwalker following the edges visits most frequently:ppr = cMppr + (1?
c)vppr, (1)where M is a transition probability matrix be-tween the n WordNet synsets, c is a damping fac-tor, and vppr is a vector of size n representingthe probability of jumping to the node i associatedwith each vi.
For personalized PageRank, vppr isinitialized in a particular way: the initial weight isdistributed equally over the m vector components(i.e., synsets) associated with a word in the sensegloss, other components receive a 0 value.For each similarity measure, Niemann andGurevych (2011) determine a threshold (tppr andtcos) independently on a manually annotated goldstandard.
The final alignment decision is the con-junction of two decision functions:a(ss, st) =PPR(ss, st) > tppr& COS(ss, st) > tcos.
(2)We differ from Niemann and Gurevych (2011) inthat we use a joint training setup which determinestppr and tcos to optimize classification performancedirectly (as proposed in Gurevych et al (2012)):(tppr, tcos) = argmax(tppr,tcos)F1(a), (3)where F1 is the maximized evaluation score and ais the decision function in equation (2).5.2 Candidate ExtractionTo compile the candidate set, we paired sensesfrom both resources with identical lemma-POScombinations.
FrameNet senses are defined by alemma, a gloss, and a frame.
Wiktionary sensesare defined by a lemma and a gloss.
For theFrameNet sense Activity finish of the verb com-plete, we find two candidate senses in Wiktionary(to finish and to make whole).
There are on av-erage 3.7 candidates per FrameNet sense.
The fullcandidate setCall contains over 44,000 sense pairsand covers 97% of the 11,942 FrameNet senses.5.3 Gold Standard CreationFor the gold standard, we sampled 2,900 candidatepairs from Call.
The properties of the gold stan-dard mirror the properties of Call: the samplingpreserved the distribution of POS in Call (around40% verbs and nouns, and 12% adjectives) andthe average numbers of candidates per FrameNetsense.
This ensures that highly polysemous wordsas well as words with few senses are selected.Two human raters annotated the sense pairsbased on their glosses.
The annotation task con-sisted in a two-class annotation: Do the presentedsenses have same meaning - (YES/NO).
The ratersreceived detailed guidelines and were trained onaround 100 sense pairs drawn from the sample.We computed Cohen?s ?
to measure the inter-rater agreement between the two raters.
It is?=0.72 on the full set, which is considered accept-able according to Artstein and Poesio (2008).

Wikipedia gold stan-dard.
These gold standards only consist of nouns,which appear to be an easier annotation task thanverb senses.
This is supported by our analysis ofthe agreement by POS (see Table 1): the agree-ment on nouns and adjectives lies between the twoagreement scores previously reported on nouns.Thus our annotation is of similar quality.
Onlythe agreement on verbs is slightly below the ac-ceptability threshold of 0.67 (Artstein and Poesio,2008).
The verb senses are very fine-grained andthus present a difficult alignment task.
Therefore,we had an expert annotator correct the verbal partof the gold standard set.
After removing the train-ing set for the raters, the final gold standard con-tains 2,789 sense pairs.
28% of these are aligned.5.4 Alignment ExperimentsWe determined the best setting for the alignmentof FrameNet and Wiktionary in a ten-fold cross-validation on the gold standard.Besides the parameters for the computation ofthe PPR vectors (we used the publicly availableUKB tool by Agirre and Soroa (2009)), the mainparameter in the experiments is the textual in-formation that is used to represent the senses.For FrameNet senses, we used the lemma-pos,sense gloss, example sentences, frame name andframe definition as textual features; for Wiktionarysenses, we considered lemma-pos, sense gloss, ex-ample sentences, hyponyms and synonyms.We computed the similarity scores on tok-enized, lemmatized and stop-word-filtered texts.First, we evaluated models for COS and PPRindependently based on various combinations ofthe textual features listed above.
We then usedthe parameter setting of the best-performing sin-gle models to train the model that jointly optimizesthe thresholds for PPR and COS (see eqn.
(5)).
InTable 2, we report on the results of the best singlemodels and the best joint model.For the evaluation, we compute precision P, re-call R and F1 on the positive class (aligned=true),e.g., precision P is the number of pairs correctlyaligned divided by all aligned pairs.We achieved the highest precision and F1-scoreEvaluation verb noun adj allP Random-1 BL 0.503 0.559 0.661 0.557WKT-1 BL 0.620 0.664 0.725 0.66BEST COS 0.639 0.778 0.706 0.703BEST PPR 0.66 0.754 0.729 0.713BEST JOINT 0.677 0.766 0.742 0.728R Random-1 BL 0.471 0.546 0.683 0.540WKT-1 BL 0.581 0.65 0.75 0.64BEST COS 0.658 0.758 0.754 0.715BEST PPR 0.666 0.724 0.754 0.699BEST JOINT 0.683 0.783 0.83 0.75F1 Random-1 BL 0.487 0.552 0.672 0.549WKT-1 BL 0.60 0.657 0.737 0.65BEST COS 0.648 0.768 0.729 0.709BEST PPR 0.663 0.739 0.741 0.706BEST JOINT 0.68 0.775 0.784 0.739UBound 0.735 0.834 0.864 0.797Table 2: Alignment performance by POS.for COS using all available features, but excludingFrameNet example sentences because they intro-duce too much noise.
Adding the frame name andframe definition to the often short glosses providesa richer sense representation for the COS measure.The best-performing PPR configuration usessense gloss and lemma-pos.
For the joint model,we employed the best single PPR configuration,and a COS configuration that uses sense gloss ex-tended by Wiktionary hypernyms, synonyms andFrameNet frame name and frame definition, toachieve the highest score, an F1-score of 0.739.5.5 Gold Standard EvaluationWe compared the performance of our alignmenton the gold standard to a baseline which randomlyselects one target sense from the candidate set ofeach source sense (Random-1).
We also considerthe more competitive Wiktionary first sense base-line (WKT-1).
It is guided by the heuristic thatmore frequent senses are listed first in Wiktionary(Meyer and Gurevych, 2010).
It is a stronger base-line with an F1-score of 0.65 (see Table 2).To derive the upper bound for the alignment per-formance (UBound), we computed the F1 scorefrom the average pairwise F1-score of the annota-tors according to Hripcsak and Rothschild (2005).As the evaluation set mirrors the POS distri-bution in FrameNet and is sufficiently large, un-like earlier alignments, we can analyze the per-formance by POS.
The BEST JOINT model per-forms well on nouns, slightly better on adjectives,and worse on verbs, see Table 2.
For the baselinesand the UBound the same applies, with the dif-ference that adjectives receive even better results1367in comparison.
This fits in with the perceived de-gree of difficulty according to the observed poly-semy for the POS: for verbs we have many candi-date sets with two or more candidates, i.e., we ob-serve higher polysemy, while for nouns and evenstronger for adjectives, many small candidate setsoccur, which stand for an easier alignment de-cision.
This is in line with the reported highercomplexity of lexical resources with respect toverbs and greater difficulty in alignments and wordsense disambiguation (Laparra and Rigau, 2010).The performance of BEST JOINT on all POSis F1=0.73, which is significantly higher than theWKT-1 baseline (p<0.05 according to McNe-mar?s test).
The performance on nouns (F1=0.775)is on par with the results reported by Niemann andGurevych (2011) for nouns (F1=0.78).5.6 Error AnalysisThe confusion matrix from the evaluation of BESTJOINT on the gold standard shows 214 false pos-itives and 191 false negatives.
The false nega-tives suffer from low overlap between the glosses,which are often quite short (contend - assert),sometimes circular (sinful - relating to sin).
Align-ing senses with such glosses is difficult for a sys-tem based on semantic similarity.
In about 50% ofthe analyzed pairs, highly similar words are usedin the gloss, that we should be able to detect withsecond-order representations, for instance by ex-panding short definitions with the definitions ofthe contained words, or via derivational similarity.A number of false positives occur because thegold standard was developed in a very fine-grainedmanner: distinctions such as causative vs. inchoa-tive (enlarge: become large vs. enlarge: makelarge) were explicitly stressed in the definitionsand thus annotated as different senses by the anno-tators.
This was motivated by the fact that this dis-tinction is relevant for many frames in FrameNet.The first meaning of enlarge belongs to the frameExpansion, the second to Cause expansion.
Oursimilarity based approach cannot capture such dif-ferences well.6 Intermediate Resource FNWKxx6.1 StatisticsWe applied the best system setup to the full can-didate set of over 44,000 candidates to create theintermediate resource FNWKxx.

Itconnects more than 9,800 unique FrameNet senseswith more than 10,000 unique Wiktionary senses,which shows that both non-alignments and multi-ple alignments occur for some source senses.6.2 Post-hoc EvaluationOur cross-validation approach entails the dangerof over-fitting.
In order to verify the quality ofthe alignment, we performed a detailed post-hocanalysis on a sample of 270 aligned sense pairsrandomly drawn from the set of aligned senses.Because sense granularity was an issue in theerror analysis, we considered two alignment deci-sions: (a) fine-grained alignment: the two glossesdescribe the same sense; (b) coarse-grained align-ment.
The causative/inchoative distinction is,among others, ignored.The evaluation results are listed in Table 3.
Theprecision for the fine-grained (a) is lower than theallover precision on the gold standard.
The evalua-tion by POS shows that the result for nouns and ad-jectives is equal or superior to the evaluation resulton the gold standard, while it is worse for verbs.This shows that over-fitting, if at all, is only a riskfor the verb senses.The allover precision for (b) exceeds the pre-cision on the gold standard.
Particularly verbsreceive much better results.
This shows thata coarse-grained alignment may suffice for theFrameNet extension.This evaluation confirms the quality of thesense alignment, in particular with respect to theFrameNet extension.
But it also elicits the ques-tion whether a coarse-grained alignment wouldsuffice.
We will discuss this question below.6.3 Resource AnalysisFor each of the aligned senses in the 12,094aligned sense pairs, we extracted glosses fromWiktionary.
Because FrameNet glosses are oftenvery brief, the additional glosses will benefit algo-rithms such as frame detection for SRL.
We alsoadded 4,352 new example sentences from Wik-1368tionary to FrameNet.We can extract 2,151 new lemma-POS forFrameNet frames from the synonyms of thealigned senses in Wiktionary.
We also ex-tract other related lemma-POS, for instance 487antonyms, 126 hyponyms, and 19 hypernyms.This step establishes Wiktionary as an interlin-gual connection between FrameNet and a largenumber of languages, including low-resourceones: via Wiktionary, we connect FrameNetsenses to translations in 283 languages, e.g., wetranslate the sense of the verb complete associ-ated with the frame Activity Finish to the Germancolloquial fertigmachen, the Spanish terminar, theTurkish tamamlamak, and 19 other languages.For 36 languages, we can extract more than1,000 translations each, among them low-resourcelanguages such as Telugu, Swahili, or Kurdish.The languages with most translations are: Finnish(9,333), Russian (7,790), and German (6,871).The number of Finnish translations is more thanthree times larger than the preliminary FinnishFrameNet by Borin et al (2012).
Likewise, weget three times the number of German lemma-POSthan provided by the SALSA corpus.7 Translation Disambiguation7.1 Disambiguation MethodFNWKxx initially does not provide lexical-semantic information for the German translations:the translations link to a lemma in the GermanWiktionary, not a target sense.
In order to inte-grate the information attached to a German Wik-tionary sense, e.g., the gloss, into our resource, thelemmas need to be disambiguated.We use the sense-disambiguated Wiktionary re-sulting from a recently published approach forthe disambiguation of relations and translations inWiktionary (Meyer and Gurevych, 2012a) to cre-ate our new bilingual (German-English) FrameNetlexicon FNWKde.Their approach combines information on thesource sense and all potential target senses in orderto determine the best target sense in a rule-baseddisambiguation strategy.
The information is en-coded as binary features, which are ordered in aback-off hierarchy: if the first feature applies, thetarget sense is selected, otherwise the second fea-ture is considered, and so forth.The most important features are: definitionoverlap between source and automatically trans-SALSA2 P&L05 FNWKdeType Corpus Corpus LexiconCreation Manual Automatic AutomaticFrames(+p) 266(907) 468 755Senses 1,813 9,851 5,897Examples 24,184 1,672,551 6,933Glosses - - 5,897Table 4: Frame-semantic resources for German.lated target definition; occurrence of the sourcelemma in the target definition; shared linguisticinformation (e.g., same register); inverse transla-tion relations (i.e., the source lemma occurs on thetranslation list of the target sense); relation over-lap; Lesk measure between original and translatedglosses in source and target language; and finally,backing off to the first target sense.For the gold standard evaluation of the approachwe refer to Meyer and Gurevych (2012a): theirsystem obtained an F1-score of 0.67 for the task ofdisambiguating translations from English to Ger-man, and an F1-score of 0.79 for the disambigua-tion of English sense relations.
We use the latter toidentify target senses of synonyms in FNWKxx.8 Resource FNWKde8.1 StatisticsTable 4 gives an overview of FNWKde.
It con-tains 5,897 pairs of German Wiktionary sensesand FrameNet senses, i.e., 86% of the translationscould be disambiguated.
Each sense has a gloss,and there are 6,933 example sentences.Based on the relation disambiguation and in-ference of new relations by Meyer and Gurevych(2012a), we can also disambiguate synonyms inthe English Wiktionary.
This leads to a further ex-tension of the English FrameNet summarized inTable 5.
The number of Wiktionary senses alignedto FrameNet senses is increased by 50%.We also provide results for other sense relations,e.g., antonyms.
We will discuss whether and howthey can be integrated as FrameNet senses in ourresource below.8.2 Post-hoc EvaluationBecause the errors of two subsequently applied au-tomatic methods can multiply, we provide a post-hoc evaluation of the results.To evaluate the quality of the German FrameNetlexicon, we collected the FrameNet senses for alist of 15 frames that were sampled by Pado?

There are 115 senses associatedwith these frames in our resource.
In a manualevaluation of these 115 senses, we find that 67%were assigned correctly to their frames.
This ishigher than expected, considering the errors fromthe applied methods add up.Further analysis revealed that both resource cre-ation steps contribute equally to the 39 errors.
For17 of the evaluated sense pairs, redundancy con-firms their quality: they were obtained indepen-dently by two or three alignment-and-translationpaths and do not contain alignment errors.8.3 ComparisonWe compare FNWKde to two German frame-semantic resources, the manually annotatedSALSA corpus (Burchardt et al, 2006) and aresource from Pado?
and Lapata (2005), hence-forth P&L05.
Note that both resources are frame-annotated corpora, while FNWKde is a FrameNet-like lexicon and contains information complemen-tary to the corpora.
The different properties of theresources are contrasted in Table 4.The automatically developed resources, includ-ing FNWKde, provide a larger number of sensesthan SALSA.
The annotated corpora contain alarge number of examples, but they do not pro-vide any glosses, which are useful for frame detec-tion in SRL, nor do they contain any other lexical-semantic information.FNWKde covers a larger number of FrameNetframes than the other two resources.
266 of the907 frames in SALSA are connected to originalFrameNet frames, the others are newly-developedproto-frames p (shown in parentheses in Table 4).Table 6 describes the proportion of the over-lapping frames and senses3 to the respective re-sources.
The numbers on frame overlap showthat our resource covers the frames in the other3Note that the senses in SALSA and P&L05 are definedby frame, lemma, and POS.
In Table 6, FNWKde senseswith identical frame, lemma, and POS, but different gloss aretherefore conflated to one sense.Resource r % of r % of FNWKdeFrame SALSA 2 89% 31%P&L05 90% 55%Sense SALSA 2 15% 5%P&L05 10% 19%Table 6: Overlap of FNWKde with resource r.resources well (89% and 90% coverage respec-tively), and that it adds frames not covered in theother resources: P&L05 only covers 55% of theframes in FNWKde.
The sense overlap showsthat the resources have senses in common, whichconfirms the quality of the automatically devel-oped resources, but they also complement eachother.
FNWKde, for instance, adds 3,041 sensesto P&L05.9 Discussion: a Multilingual FrameNetFNWKxx builds an excellent starting point to cre-ate FrameNet lexicons in various languages: thetranslation counts, for instance 6,871 for German,compare favorably to FrameNet 1.5, which con-tains 9,700 English lemma-POS.To create those FrameNet lexicons, the transla-tion disambiguation approach used for FNWKde(step 2 in Fig.
1) needs to be adapted to other lan-guages.
The approach is in theory applicable toany language, but there are some obstacles: first,it relies on the availability of the target sense inthe target language Wiktionary.
For many of thetop 30 languages in FNWKxx, the Wiktionary edi-tions seem sufficiently large to provide targets fortranslation disambiguation,4 and they are contin-uously extended.
Second, our approach requiresaccess to the target language Wiktionary, but thedata format across Wiktionary language editionsis not standardized.
Third, the approach requiresmachine translation into the target language.
Forlanguages, where such a tool is not available, wecould default to the first-sense-heuristic, or en-courage the Wiktionary community to link thetranslations to their target Wiktionary senses in-spired by Sajous et al (2010).Another issue that applies to all automatic(and also manual) approaches of cross-lingualFrameNet extension is the restricted cross-language applicability of frames.
Boas (2005)reports that, while many frames are largely4see overview table at http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/fnwkde/.1370language-independent, other frames receiveculture-specific or language-specific interpreta-tions, for example calendars or holidays.
Also,fine-grained sense and frame distinctions may bemore relevant in one language than in anotherlanguage.
Such granularity differences also ledto the addition of proto-frames in SALSA 2 (Re-hbein et al, 2012).
Therefore, manual correctionor extension of a multilingual FrameNet based onFNWKde may be desired for specific applications.In this case, the automatically created FrameNetsin other languages are good starting points thatcan be quickly and efficiently compiled.The quality of the multilingual FNWKxx de-pends on i) the translations in the interlingual con-nection Wiktionary, which are manually created,controlled by the community, and therefore reli-able, and ii) on the FrameNet?Wiktionary align-ment.
Therefore, we evaluated our sense align-ment method in detail.
The alignment reachesstate-of-the-art results, and the analysis shows thatthe method is particularly fit for a coarse-grainedalignment.
We however find lower performancefor verbs in a fine-grained setting.
We arguethat an improved alignment algorithm, for instancetaking subcategorization information into account,can identify the fine-grained distinctions.The post-hoc analysis raised the question ofFrameNet frame granularity.
Do separate framesexist for causative/inchoative alternations (as Be-ing dry and Cause to be dry for to dry), or do theybelong to the same frame (Make noise for to creakand to creak something)?
For the coarse-grainedframes, fine-grained decisions can be merged in asecond classification step.
Alternatively, we couldmap Wiktionary senses directly to frames, and in-clude features that cover the granularity distinc-tions, e.g., whether the existing senses of a frameshow the semantic alternation.We could use the same approach to assignsenses to a frame which are derived via senserelations other than synonymy, i.e., for linkingantonyms or hyponyms to a frame.
Some framesdo cover antonymous predicates, others do not.Based on Wiktionary, our approach suffers lessfrom the disadvantages of previous resource-basedwork, i.e., the constraints of expert-built resourcesand the lack of lexical information in Wikipedia.Unlike corpus-based approaches for cross-lingualFrameNet extension, our approach does not pro-vide frame-semantic annotations for the examplesentences.
Our advantage is that we create aFrameNet lexicon with lexical-semantic informa-tion in the target language.
Example annotationscan be additionally obtained via cross-lingual an-notation projection (Pado?
and Lapata, 2009), andthe lexical information in FNWKde can be used toguide this process.10 ConclusionThe resource-coverage bottleneck for frame-semantic resources is particularly severe for lesswell-resourced languages.
We present a simple,but effective approach to solve this problem usingthe English Wiktionary as an interlingual repre-sentation and subsequent translation disambigua-tion in the target language.
We validate our ap-proach on the language pair English-German anddiscuss the options and requirements for creatingFrameNets in further languages.As part of this work, we created the first sensealignment between FrameNet and the EnglishWiktionary.
The resulting resource FNWKxx con-nects FrameNet senses to over 280 languages.
Thebilingual English-German FrameNet lexicon FN-WKde competes with manually created resources,as shown by a comparison to the SALSA corpus.We make both resources publicly available inthe standardized format UBY-LMF (Eckle-Kohleret al, 2012), which supports automatic processingof the resources via the UBY Java API, seehttp://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/fnwkde/.We also extended FrameNet by several thou-sand new English senses from Wiktionary whichare provided as part of FNWKde.
In our futurework, we will evaluate the benefits of the extractedinformation to SRL.AcknowledgmentsThis work has been supported by the Volk-swagen Foundation as part of the Lichtenberg-Professorship Program under grant No.
