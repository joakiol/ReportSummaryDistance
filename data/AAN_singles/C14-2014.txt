Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations,pages 62?66, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-29 2014.TweetGenie: Development, Evaluation, and Lessons LearnedDong Nguyen1Dolf Trieschnigg1Theo Meder2(1) Human Media Interaction, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands(2) Meertens Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands{d.nguyen,d.trieschnigg}@utwente.nl, theo.meder@meertens.knaw.nlAbstractTweetGenie is an online demo that infers the gender and age of Twitter users based on theirtweets.
TweetGenie was able to attract thousands of visitors.
We collected data by asking feed-back from visitors and launching an online game.
In this paper, we describe the development ofTweetGenie and evaluate the demo based on the received feedback and manual annotation.
Wealso reflect on practical lessons learned from launching a demo for the general public.1 IntroductionThe language use of speakers is related to variables such as the speaker?s gender and age (Eckert, 1997;Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2013).
Systems that can automatically predict such variables have beenreceiving increasing attention.
They enable more fine-grained analyses of trends by profiling the involvedusers.
They also support sociolinguistics research by shedding light on the link between variables suchas gender and age, and the language use of speakers.In this paper, we describe TweetGenie (www.tweetgenie.nl), a website that allows visitors to enterpublic Dutch Twitter accounts.
The system predicts gender and age of the users behind the enteredaccounts based on the 200 most recent tweets.
Due to press attention from various media outlets, wewere able to attract a large number of visitors.
In comparison to previous gender and age predictionsystems that have been evaluated with carefully constructed datasets, we are the first to evaluate theperformance of such a system ?in the wild?.We first discuss the development of TweetGenie (Section 2).
Next, we study the launch and TweetGe-nie?s spread through social media, based on log data of the first week after the launch (Section 3).
Wethen evaluate TweetGenie based on collected feedback (Section 4) and reflect on practical issues we en-countered while launching an online demo for the general public (Section 5).
We end with a conclusion(Section 6).2 TweetGenieIn this section we describe the development and setup of TweetGenie.Goals The original research (Nguyen et al., 2013) was carried out to support analyses of trends and tostudy sociolinguistic aspects of language use.
By launching a public demo of this research, we aimedto 1) test the system on a large-scale ?in the wild?
2) collect data, and 3) demo the project to interestedpeople.
Unlike most demos of NLP research, the target audience of this demo was the ?general public?.For example, we aimed for a simple and attractive interface, and released a press announcement to reacha large audience.Model TweetGenie was developed based on the research and dataset described in (Nguyen et al., 2013)and predicts the gender and age of Dutch Twitter users based on the 200 most recent tweets.
First,unigrams and bigrams are extracted from the tweets using the tokenization tool by O?Connor et al.(2010).

We then trained logistic (for gender prediction) and linear (forage prediction) regression models (Pedregosa et al., 2011) with L2 regularization.Setup TweetGenie is available at www.tweetgenie.nl.
After a visitor enters a public Twitter account,a results page is shown (see Figure 1 for a screenshot).
The results page shows the predicted age (inyears), the gender, and a gender ?score?
indicating how strong the prediction was (based on x>?
withx being the features and ?
the estimated parameters).
In addition, an option is available to share theirresults page on Twitter.An overview of the components is shown in Figure 3.
The first webserver hosts the frontend.
AMySQL database is used to keep track of the progress of each prediction, and to store logs and feed-back received by users.
A second webserver is used to retrieve the data from Twitter and perform thepredictions.Feedback To collect data and improve the system, users are encouraged to provide feedback on thepredictions.
On the page with the automatic prediction (Figure 1), users have the option to enter thecorrect age and confirm whether the gender prediction was correct.Online Game We also developed an online game to study how humans perform on the task.
Figure 2shows a screenshot of the interface.
Players are shown 20-40 tweets per Twitter user and have to guessthe gender and age of the Twitter users behind the tweets.
After each guess, players receive feedbackin various ways (the correct gender and age, the predictions by the automatic system, and the averageguesses by other players).
The data collected proved to be valuable: using the data, we reflected on thetask of inferring gender and age from tweets and the limitations of current systems (Nguyen et al., 2014).Figure 1: Screenshot prediction interfaceFigure 2: Screenshot online game.
Based on the shown tweets, players are asked to guess the gender andage of the user behind the tweets.633 Launching TweetGenieTweetGenie was launched on May 13, 2013 at around 11.30 AM.
To reach a large audience, a pressstatement was released and messages were posted on social media networks.
In this section, we analyzethe data in the first week after the launch.Figure 3 shows the number of entered Twitter users and the number of tweets mentioning TweetGeniein the first week after the launch.
The number of tweets and the number of users entered follow similartrends.
We observe a high peak in the beginning, but it also rapidly decreases over time.
The systemwas asked to make a prediction 87,818 times and 9,291 tweets were posted with the word ?TweetGenie?.1,931 of these tweets were created using the tweet sharing function of TweetGenie.
The observed senti-ment was mostly positive.
If TweetGenie made an incorrect prediction, most people joked about it (e.g.?
*grin* I just became 13 years younger without plastic chirurgy #tweetgenie?).
The game was playedoften as well, a guess was made 31,414 times.TimeNum.

In the first week, wereceived feedback on the gender of 16,563 users and on the age of 17,034 users.Reliability We randomly sampled 150 Twitter users for which we received feedback on both the genderand age.
We checked the feedback of these users by visiting their Twitter profiles.
If the feedback seemedplausible based on the profile, we assumed the feedback was correct (i.e.
we did not visit any other socialmedia profiles to find the exact age).
The results are shown in Table 1.
We find that 90% of the feedbackappears to be correct.
Only a small fraction (4%) of the feedback was incorrect, this could be deliberateor due to sloppiness.
The remaining feedback was on Twitter accounts of non-Dutch users (e.g.
English,German, French), or accounts that did not represent a person (e.g.
a sports team, animal, multiplepersons).Accuracy We calculate the performance based on the 135 users for who we received correct feedback.We find that the users who gave feedback are not representative of the general Dutch Twitter population(Nguyen et al., 2013).
The users are older than average (the age distribution is shown in Figure 4).
Thereare more older males, and more younger females using Twitter in the Netherlands (Nguyen et al., 2013),and as a consequence the number of males (60.7%) is higher than the number of females (39.3%).Based on this dataset, we find that the accuracy of the gender predictions was 94%.
The Mean AbsoluteError (MAE) for the age predictions is 6.1 years, which is higher than reported in (Nguyen et al., 2013).64Feedback Frequency PercentageCorrect 135 90%Incorrect 6 4%Not a Dutch account 5 3.33%Not a person 4 2.67%Table 1: Statistics feedback reliabilityAgeFrequency10 20 30 40 50 60 700510152025Figure 4: Age distribution feedbackHowever, this can be explained by the observation that relatively many older Twitter users give feedback,and as discussed in (Nguyen et al., 2013), automatic age predictions for older Twitter users are lessaccurate.4.2 Evaluation Based on Manual AnnotationWe also evaluated the system by manually annotating 50 users that were randomly sampled from theentered users in the logs.
We did not include accounts that were not Dutch or did not represent individualpersons.
If feedback was available for a Twitter user, we used the provided feedback (after a manualcheck).
Otherwise, we manually annotated the gender and age using all available information (e.g.
socialmedia profiles, websites).
The gender was correctly predicted for 82% of the users, which is lower thanmeasured in the evaluation based on the user feedback (Section 4.1).
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE)is 6.18 years, which is in line with the observed MAE based on the user feedback.Our analyses confirm that users for who feedback was available are not representative of all users whowere entered in the system.
Of the sampled 50 entered users, the fraction of males and females is almostequal (52% and 48%) compared to 60.7% and 30.9% in Section 4.1.
The number of users who were lessthan 20 years old (15) is similar to the number of users in the range of > 20 and?
30 years (17), while inSection 4.1 the fraction of users below 20 years is smaller.
Thus, less feedback was received for youngerTwitter users.In line with the analysis in Section 4.1, we find that relatively many older Twitter users were enteredinto TweetGenie compared to a more representative set of Dutch Twitter users (Nguyen et al., 2013).5 Lessons LearnedWe learned many lessons from launching a demo for the general public.1) Test all components of the demo.
While developing the system, we focused mostly on ensuringthat the backend would be able to handle the number of visitors.
However, after the demo went online,problems arose at the frontend due to the visitor load.
This was solved by only allowing a fixed numberof visitors at the same time.
We also did not test the interface for non-Dutch visitors.
Only later we foundout that the automatically translated version contained serious errors: international visitors were misledthat the model worked on English tweets.2) The distribution of users trying out the demo might not correspond to the distribution in the devel-opment dataset.
While we extensively evaluated the system on a carefully constructed, representativedataset (Nguyen et al., 2013), the numbers in this paper?s evaluation are lower.
Users who were enteredinto the system were not representative of the Dutch Twitter population: relatively more older Twitterusers were entered in the system, leading to more errors in the automic age prediction.3) A demo is a good opportunity to collect data.
Many visitors were willing to provide feedback orparticipated in the online game.
Data collected through the online game has been used to study the taskof inferring gender and age in more depth (Nguyen et al., 2014).
Manual analysis of the feedback in thispaper revealed that almost all of the feedback appears to be genuine.
Further research is needed to studyhow the feedback on the automatic predictions can be used to improve the prediction models.656 ConclusionIn this paper we discussed TweetGenie, an online system that infers the gender and age of Twitter usersbased on tweets alone.
We collected much feedback from the users, but also found that users whoprovided feedback are not representative of all the entered users.
We demonstrated that besides being avaluable tool for user profiling, TweetGenie also appeals to the general public.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW)and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), grants IB/MP/2955 (TINPOT) and640.005.002 (FACT).ReferencesP.
