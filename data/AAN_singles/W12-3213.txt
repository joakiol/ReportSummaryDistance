We contribute to the goal of en-riching the textual content of ACL Anthologyby identifying the citation contexts in a paperand linking them to their corresponding ref-erences in the bibliography section.
We useParscit, to process the Bibliography of eachpaper.
Pattern matching heuristics are thenused to connect the citations with their ref-erences.
Furthermore, we prepared a smallevaluation dataset, to test the efficiency of ourmethod.
We achieved 95% precision and 80%recall on this dataset.1 IntroductionACL Anthology represents the enduring effort todigitally archive all the publications related to CLand NLP, over the years.
Recent work by (Birdet al, 2008) to standardize the corpus in ACL An-thology, makes it more than just a digital reposi-tory of research results.
The corpus has metadatainformation such as ?title?, ?author (s)?, ?publicationvenue?
and ?year?
about each paper along with theirextracted text content.
However it lacks vital in-formation about a scientific article such as positionof footnote (s), table (s) and figure captions, biblio-graphic references, italics/emphasized text portions,non-latin scripts, etc.We would like to acknowledge funding support in part bythe Global Asia Institute under grant no.

R-252-000-325-279.The special workshop at ACL 2012, celebrates50 years of ACL legacy by gathering contributionsabout the history, evolution and future of compu-tational linguistics.
Apart from the technical pro-gramme, the workshop also hosts a contributed taskto enrich the current state of Anthology corpus.
Arich-text format of the corpus will serve as a sourceof study for research applications like citation anal-ysis, summarization, argumentative zoning amongmany others.We contribute to this effort of enriching the An-thology, by providing a means to link citations inan article to their corresponding bibliographic refer-ences.
Robert Dale 1 defines citation, as a text stringin the document body that points to a reference at theend of the document.
Several citations may co-referto a single reference string.
As an example considerthe following sentence,Few approaches to parsing have tried to handledisfluent utterances (notable exceptions are Core& Schubert, 1999; Hindle, 1983; Nakatani &Hirschberg, 1994).The portion of texts in italics are the citations andwe intend to annotate each citation with an uniqueidentifier of their bibliographic reference.<ref target="BI10">Hindle, 1983</ref>Such annotations are useful for navigating be-tween research articles and creating citation net-works among them.
These networks can be used tounderstand the bibliometric analysis of a corpus.1http://web.science.mq.edu.au/ rdale/1102 DesignThe task organizers distribute the entire Anthol-ogy in two different XML formats, ?paperXML?that is obtained from Optical Character Recognition(OCR) software and ?TEI P5 XML?
that is generatedby PDFExtract (?yvind Raddum Berg, 2011).
Wechose to process the PDFExtract format as it has nocharacter recognition errors.
Since the expected out-put should also follow ?TEI P5?
guidelines, the lat-ter input simplifies the process of target XML gen-eration.
The task of linking citations to referencesprimarily consists of three modules.1.
Processing the ?Bibliography?
section of a pa-per using Parscit.2.
Formatting the Parscit output to TEI P5 guide-lines and merging it with the input XML.3.
Generating an identifier and citation marker foreach reference and annotating the text.Figure 1 illustrates the overall design of our work.Below we describe in detail about the modules usedto accomplish this task.Figure 1: Overall design for linking citation text to refer-encesBibliography Parser: Parscit (Councill et al,2008) is a freely available, open-source implementa-tion of a reference string parsing package.
It formu-lates this task as a sequence labelling problem that iscommon to a large set of NLP tasks including POStagging and chunking.
Parscit uses a conditionalrandom field formalism to learn a supervised modeland apply it on unseen data.
During training, eachreference is represented using different classes offeatures such as n-gram, token identity, punctuationand other numeric properties.
Parscit can label eachreference with 13 classes that correspond to com-mon fields used in bibliographic reference manage-ment software.
Unlike heuristic methods, Parscit?ssupervised learning model can handle different stan-dards followed by different communities and inad-vertent manual errors in the Bibliography.
Prior toprocessing, Parscit segments the Bibliography sec-tion from the rest of the paper using SectLabel (Lu-ong et al, 2010), its extension for logical documentstructure discovery.Parscit works either with plain text or the Omni-page output of a paper.
Omnipage 2 is a state ofthe art OCR engine that provides detailed informa-tion about the layout of a document.
Omnipage alsohandles older, scanned papers.
It gives the logicalindex of every line in terms of page, column, para-graph, and line number.
The layout information isused by Parscit to remove noise such as page num-bers and footnotes between references and properlydivide them.
Following is the Omnipage output forthe word ?Rahul Agarwal?
in the original pdf,<ln l="558" t="266" r="695" b="284"bold=true superscript="none"fontSize="1250" fontFamily="roman"><wd l="558" t="266" r="609" b="284">Rahul </wd> <space/><wd l="619" t="266" r="695" b="283">Agarwal </wd></ln>The ?l?
(left), ?r?
(right), ?t?
(top), ?b?
(bottom) at-tributes gives the exact location of an element in apage.
Further, features such as ?bold?, ?underlined?,?superscript/ subscript?
and ?fontFamily?
contributetowards an accurate identification and parsing of ref-erences.
For example, the change from one fontfamily to another usually serves as a separator be-tween two different fields like ?author?
and ?title?
ofthe paper.
As PDFExtract currently does not providesuch information, we processed the original ?pdf?file using Omnipage and then finally parsed it us-ing Parscit.
Below is the XML output from Parscitfor a single reference,2www.nuance.com/omnipage/111<citation valid="true"><authors><author>R Agarwal</author><author>L Boggess</author></authors><title>A simple but useful approachto conjunct identification.</title><date>1992</date><marker>Agarwal, Boggess, 1992</marker> </citation>We used Parscit to segment the Bibliographysection into individual references.
Additionally weuse the author, title, publication year informationtogether with the original marker of each referenceto generate citation markers that are used to find thecontext of each reference (explained later).
Duringthis process, we generated the Omnipage outputfor the present Anthology that consists of 21,107publications.
As the ACL ARC has Omnipageoutputs only till 2007, our contribution will help toupdate the corpus.XML Merger: The original XML output fromParscit doesn?t conform with the TEI P5 guidelines.The ?XML Merger?
module formats the Parscitoutput into a ?listBibl?
element and merges it withthe PDFExtract.
The ?listBibl?
element contains alist of ?biblStruct?
elements, in which bibliographicsub-elements of each reference appear in a specifiedorder.
Each reference is also assigned a ?uniqueid?
within the paper to link them with their citationtexts.
The Bibliography section in the PDFExtractis replaced with the TEI compatible Parscit outputsuch as below,<listBibl><bibl xml:id="BI2"><monogr><author>R Agarwal</author><author>L Boggess</author><title>A simple but useful approachto conjunct identification.</title><imprint><date>1992</date></imprint></monogr></bibl>To ensure a proper insertion, we search for labelssuch as ?References?, ?Bibliography?, ?Referencesand Notes?, or common variations of those strings.In the case of having more than one match, thecontext of first reference is used to resolve theambiguity.
The match is considered as the startingpoint of the Bibliography section, and the terminalreference string from the Parscit output is used tomark the end of it.
After validating the matchedportion based on the position of its starting andending markers, it is replaced with the formatted?listBibl?
element.Context Annotator: The final step is to bridge thelinks between references and citation strings in themerged XML.
Several morphologically differentmarkers are generated for each reference basedon the ?author?
and ?publication year?
informationprovided by Parscit.
These markers are used tofind the corresponding citation string in the mergedXML.
The markers may vary depending upon thenumber of authors in a reference or the bibliographystyle of the paper.
Sample markers for a referencewith multiple authors are listed below,Author1, Author2, Author3, YearAuthor1 et.al, YearAuthor1 and Author2, YearAlthough Parscit provide the citation markers foreach reference, the recall is very low.
We extendedthese citation markers to make them more robust andthus improve the overall recall.
Below are the exten-sions we made to the default markers.1.
Additional marker to allow square brackets andround brackets in the parentheses.
Such mark-ers help to identify citations such as (Author,Year), [Author, Year], (Author, [year])2.
Parscit markers only identify the citations withthe 4-digit format of the year.
We modified it torecognize both 4-digit and 2-digit format of theyear.
e.g.
Lin, 1996 and Lin, 963.
Parscit doesn?t differentiate between identicalreference strings with same author and year in-formation.
We resolved it by including the ver-sion number of the reference in the marker.
e.g.Lin, 2004a and Lin, 2004b4.
Heuristics are added to accommodate the de-fault citation texts as specified in the referencestrings.
For example in the reference string,112[Appelt85] Appelt, D. 1985 Planning EnglishReferring Expressions.
Artificial Intelligence26: 1-33.
[Appelt85] is identified as the citation marker.
Eachmarker is represented using a regular expression.These regular expressions are applied on the textfrom merged XML.
The matches are annotated withthe unique id of its corresponding reference such as?<ref target= BI10>?3 ChallengesThe accuracy of Parscit is a bottle-neck for the per-formance of this task.
The false negatives producedby Parscit leads to erroneous linkage between cita-tion texts and reference ids.
In certain cases Parscitfails to identify portions of Bibliography section andskips them while processing.
This results in an in-correct parsing and thus faulty linkage.
Apart fromParscit, we faced problems due to the character mis-matching between Omnipage and PDFExtract out-puts of a paper.
For example the string ?Pulman?is recognized as Pullan by Omnipage and as Pul-man by PDFExtract.
The citation markers generatedfrom Parscit output in this case fails to identify thecontext in the PDFExtract.4 EvaluationAs there is no dataset to test the efficiency of ourmethod, we prepared a small dataset for evaluationpurposes.
We manually sampled 20 papers fromthe Anthology, making sure that all the publicationvenues are included.
The citation strings in eachpaper are manually listed out along with the corre-sponding reference id.
For citation styles where noAuthor and Year information is present, we used thecontextual words to identify the citation text.
Thecitation strings are listed in the same order as theyappear in the paper.
Below we provide an extract ofthe dataset, consisting of papers with three differentcitation styles,P92-1006 proposed [13] BI13T87-1018 Mann&Thompson83 BI6W00-0100 Krymolowski 1998 BI9The first column is the Anthology id of the paper,second column is the citation string from the paperand third column is the unique id of the reference.We measure the performance in terms of precisionand recall of the recognized citations.
There are a to-tal of 330 citation strings in the dataset.
Our methodidentified 280 strings as citations, out of which 266are correct.
Hence the precision is 0.95 (266/280)and the recall is 0.801 (266/330).
The low recall isdue to the incorrect recognition of author and yearstrings by Parscit which lead to erroneous markergeneration.
The precision is affected due to the flawsin Parscit while differentiating citations with nakednumbers.In future we plan to devise more flexible mark-ers which can handle spelling mistakes, using editdistance metric.
Partial matches and sub-sequencematches need to be incorporated to support long dis-tance citations.
Parscit can further be improved toaccurately parse and identify the reference strings.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Dr. Min-Yen Kan at NationalUniversity of Singapore for his valuable support andguidance during this work.ReferencesSteven Bird, Robert Dale, Bonnie J.
