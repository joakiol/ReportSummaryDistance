Ellipsis Resolution by Controlled Default Unification for Multi-modal andSpeech Dialog SystemsMichael StreitGerman Research Center forArtificial Intelligence - DFKIStuhlsatzenhausweg 3Saarbru?ckenGermanystreit@dfki.deHansUlrich KriegerGerman Research Center forArtificial Intelligence - DFKIStuhlsatzenhausweg 3Saarbru?ckenGermanykrieger@dfki.deAbstractWe present a default-unification-based approach toellipsis resolution that is based on experience inlong running multimodal dialog projects, where itplayed an essential role in discourse processing.
Weextend default unification to non-parallel structures,which is important for speech and multimodal di-alog systems.
We introduce new control mecha-nisms for ellipsis resolution by considering dialogstructure with respect to specification, variation andresults of tasks and combine this with the analysisof relations between the information elements con-tained in antecedent and elliptic structures.1 IntroductionThe application of default unification (Carpenter,1993) or priority union (Kaplan, 1987; Calder,1991) to discourse is attractive, because these re-lated concepts meet the intuition that new informa-tion extends, corrects, or modifies old information,instead of deleting it, by keeping what is consis-tent.1 The use of default unification as a meansfor ellipsis resolution has been discussed in the firsthalf of the nineties (Pru?st et al, 1994; Grover et al,1994).
Later, the discussion silted up, perhaps be-cause the conditions on parallelism that have beenimposed occured to be too strong (cf.
(Hobbs andKehler, 1997)).1.1 Applications in Dialog SystemsSince this discussion, default unification-based el-lipsis resolution has been applied in working sys-tems of at least two projects, where it played an es-sential role in discourse processing.The first implementations have been provided inthe second half of the nineties at Siemens, where theDIAMOD project developed a serial of prototypesfor multi-modal human machine dialog (cf.
(Streit,2001)).1Priority union as introduced by Kaplan bears essentiallythe same idea as Carpenter?s default unification.The DIAMOD project realized applications forappointment management and driver assistance, butalso for controlling machines and other technicaldevices (Streit, 1999).
The DIAMOD systems pro-vided the user with a quite natural dialog, includ-ing clarification and repair dialogs and even multi-tasking (e,g,.
the user could deal with different ap-pointments in parallel).Applied under appropriate conditions, defaultunification turned out to be a robust and efficientmethod for VP ellipsis and even NP ellipsis.
It wasalso successfully used to inherit information in situ-ations without any syntactically recognizable ellip-sis.Later in the SmartKom project (Wahlster et al,2001), default unification and its application onellipsis resolution was reinvented under the labeloverlay (Alexandersson and Becker, 2003).
Over-lay basically consists of priority unions applied toframe-like semantic representations without consid-ering reentrencies.
This inhibits providing sloppyreadings of an ellipsis (without impairing the dialogperformed in the systems very much).1.2 Problems with Default UnificationDefault unification without additional controlshows an inherent tendency to over-accumulate in-formation.
Even worse, the method may accumulateinformation that is semantically inconsistent (butnot recognized as such) or at least is practically ab-surd.
Such inconsistencies or absurdities typicallyarise from dependencies between information ele-ments that are not expressed (or not expressible) inthe type hierarchy, domain model, or ontology thatis underlying the default unification process.
Forinstance, it may occur that by introducing a nameof a new object, the address of an old object of thesame kind is inherited, which is pragmatically ab-surd.
Or a numeric date or time specification maybe wrongly combined with a deictic reference to an-other date or time, which is semantically inconsis-tent.
On the other hand, the intrinsic parallelismof default unification does inhibit the handling offragmentary and other non-parallel ellipsis, whichis very common in spoken dialog.1.3 Problems with Ellipsis Resolution inInformation Seeking DialogIn dialog systems that serve for browsing informa-tion sources, it is significant that the user modifiesand varies her query, be it spontaneously or system-atically.
As is discussed mainly in section 5, re-moving and inheriting old information are equallyimportant for ellipsis resolution in this type of in-teraction.
We want to notice, that the removal ofinformation is independent from the question if in-formation has been grounded (Traum, 1994) or not.Up to now, studies hardly consider these problems.1.4 OverviewIn this paper we will present a revised and fairly ex-tended version of the methods developed in the DI-AMOD project.2 We discuss two main problems.On the one hand we show how default unificationcan be applied to non-parallel or fragmentary struc-tures, on the other hand we discuss dependencies ofellipsis resolution from the structure of informationand tasks, that are rarely addressed in the literature.Especially we discuss the following problems.?
The extension of default unification to frag-ments.?
Control of ellipsis resolution by consideringdialog structure w.r.t.
specification, variationand results of tasks.?
Control of ellipsis resolution by consideringrelations between old and new information.?
Handling of set-valued features in specifyingvs.
varying dialog phases.We will couch our approach in terms of typedfeature structures.
Thereby features correspond toslots, and types correspond to frames.We assume feature structures being well-typed,but not totally well-typed (Carpenter, 1992).
Thismeans that for every type it is defined which fea-tures it can have, and which types come into ques-tion as values of these features.
But it is not re-quired that every possible feature is present or hasa value.
In order to use feature structures for thepurpose of encoding semantic representations, weneed set-valued features (which are semantically in-terpreted as conjunctions of its elements).
For in-stance, a movie may be described by a conjunction2The quite simple but effective means for controlling de-fault unification that have been introduced in the DIAMODsystems have not been published yet.of genres (e.g., crime and science fiction), and anappointment usually has more than one participant.3In this paper we will mainly refer to examplestaken from DIAMOD, but also make use of materialtaken from SmartKom user input.
We note here thatthe methods described in this paper are not imple-mented in SmartKom.
We also consider examplesas they are discussed in the literature.2 Default unificationDefault unification is a method to inherit defeasible(in our case old) information which does not contra-dict strict (in our case new) information.
As alreadymentioned, the consistency criterion is to weak, butthe basic approach is useful.
There are two forms ofdefault unification: credulous and skeptical defaultunification.
Credulous default unification tries tomaintain as much old information as possible.
Dueto structure sharing, there are often different alter-natives for achieving a maximal amount of old in-formation.
Skeptical default unification takes onlythe information that is common to all credulous so-lutions.
We are interested in getting every maximalsolution, which correspond to the strict, sloppy ormixed readings of ellipsis.
By mixed readings wemean readings that contain a strict reading in onepart, and a sloppy reading in another.We follow the definition of credulous de-fault unification provided by Carpenter (Carpenter,1992).
But we take the most general type as the topelement of the type lattice, while Carpenter takes itas the bottom element.If O is the old, defeasible information and N isnew, strict information, then the credulous defaultunification of O and N is the unification of O?
withN, where O?
is a minimal structure that subsumes Osuch that O?
and N unify:O>uc N = {O?uN |O?
w O minimal s.t.
O?uN 6= ?
}The following example, shows how defaultunification can be used in ellipsis resolution.1.

?3The first case concerns a closed class of values.
In prin-ciple, this case could technically be solved without set-valuedfeatures by introducing a highly differentiated (rather artificial)type system with a type for every value combination.
The sec-ond case concerns an open class of entities that cannot be com-piled in a type system.2.
And Bill does too.
[event-agentiveAGENT bill]The analysis of these utterances is slightlysimplified.
John would get a more complicated pre-sentation with john being the value of the NAMEfeature of the type person.
The verb do is consid-ered as being the most general verb with an agent.We use here event-agentive as a supertype of activi-ties.In this example the types of the top nodes are ona comparable ?level?.
By being on a comparablelevel we mean that the top node of the one item isa supertype of the top node type of the other item.Notice that due to the well-typing condition, typesand features may not be mixed arbitrarily .
For in-stance, the most general type of the type hierarchy(and many others too), cannot be combined with thefeature agent.
Otherwise our level condition wouldbe meaningless.We find two minimal upper bounds of (1.)

?3 Default Unification on SubstructuresWhile classical studies focus on parallism, the im-portance of non-parallel and fragmentary ellipsis isshown by empirical analysis of spoken dialog (cf.
(Fernandz and Ginzburg, 2002)).
The focus of anelliptic utterance often has no direct counterpart inthe antecedent, which makes Rooth?s matching con-dition not directly applicable (cf.
(Rooth, 1992),(Hardt and Romero, 2001)).
Grammatically re-quired verbs (e.g., the semantically weak verb do)may be omitted in dialog ellipsis.
In German spo-ken language, this is also possible in single and se-quential utterances of one speaker.We take an example from TALKY, which is theappointment management multimodal dialog sys-tem that was developed in the framework of DI-AMOD.
The reaction of the system to the first ut-terance of the user is not necessarily important, be-cause users often proceed with (3) without waitingfor the system?s answer (i.e., by barge in) or with-out paying much attention to the system?s reaction(in case of an experienced user).1.
USER: Ich mo?chte einen Termin eintragen.
(Iwant to enter an appointment)2.
SYSTEM: presents a new appointment entry3.
USER: mit Schmid (with Schmid)We achieve the following two representations ofthe user?s utterances.(1)?????
?wantAGENT userTOPIC?
?enterAGENT systemOBJECT appointment????????
(3)[thing-with-participantPARTICIPANT schmid]?Matching?
cannot be achieved by assuming thatthere is a hidden attitude connected to very utterancewhich could be inserted.Instead, we search for ?matching?
nodes withcomparable types before normal default unificationis applied: thing-with-participant unifies with ap-pointment, which leads to:??????
?wantAGENT userTOPIC??
?enterAGENT systemOBJECT[appointmentPARTICIPANT schmid]?????????
?In principle, it is quite possible that thing-with-participant describes a certain (collective) type ofagents.
In this case, the processing would producean ambiguity.
In the DIAMOD system as in manyother dialog systems, the agent role is usually re-stricted to the user and to incarnations of the system.It is not alway posible to find a matching type.In this case we try to find paths that connect termi-nal nodes of the antecedent structure with the topnode of the elliptic structure.
It is important, thatsuch connection paths do not introduce new struc-tures corresponding to verbal complements or sub-ordinated sentences.If no match is achieved we get simply the newstructure back, which is the normal result of apply-ing default unification to non-matching structures.4 Task Completion as a Barrier forElliptic referenceIn the following example (taken from Talky), theuser performs her specification in a stepwise man-ner by extensively using ellipsis.1.
USER: Ich mo?chte am Montag ein Treffen ein-tragen.
(I want to enter a meeting at monday)2.
SYSTEM: Presents an empty appointment en-try3.
USER: Im Bananensaal (In the ?bananaroom?)4.
SYSTEM: Presents appointment entry withbanana room5.
USER: Ich meine im Raum Leibniz (I mean inroom Leibniz)6.
SYSTEM: Presents appointment entry withroom Leibniz7.
USER: um sechs Uhr (at six o?clock)8.
SYSTEM: Presents appointment with roomand begin time 6 a.m9.
USER: abends (at the evening)10.
SYSTEM: Presents appointment with roomand begin time 6 p.mSome information has been corrected or clarified,but there was no information removed implicitly.Locally, most steps could be considerd as a case offragmentary elaboration of the preceding utterances(cf.
(Schlangen and Lascarides, 2003)).
But thisclassification depends on more general properties ofthe dialog.
When the task is finished, the availabil-ity of old information has changed:1 USER: Bitte das Treffen jetzt eintragen.
(Please enter now the meeting2 SYSTEM: Indicates that the meeting is stored3 USERa Bitte jetzt ein Treffen am Freitag eintra-gen please enter a meeting at Friday nowb Und am Freitag.
And at Friday!c Am Freitag.
At Friday!In case of 3a, the the old information is removed.With 3b we recognize that the activity (entering ameeting in a schedule) is still available for being in-herited elliptically, while further information, accu-mulated before, is no longer relevant.
If the userwants to keep the more elements of the old informa-tion, she has to use anaphoric references, e.g.,4 Und dasselbe am Freitag (And the same at Fri-day).The elliptic reading in (3b) is very clear, (3c)is rather an incomplete utterance that has to beclarified.
This is also quite different from thespecification phase of the meeting.Task completion is a barrier for fragmentary elab-oration.
4 After task completion, an elliptic re-lation has to be be marked (e.g., by clue words asund (and).
Even then, ellipsis does not refer to thewhole information accumulated before, but rather tothe utterance that introduced the specification phaseof the preceding task.5 Information BrowsingTypically, information request are answered afterevery user input without a lengthly specificationphase.
As in the case of elliptic specifications,clarification dialog does not affect the elliptic rela-tions between subsequent user queries.
If the systemactively proposes an action, this will be different.Browsing means to vary requests either because it isnot clear in advance which information is relevant,how exactly it can be obtained, or because the userwants to gather broad information in some area.In browsing dialog, ellipsis is controlled by re-lations between the informational content of the an-tecedent and the elliptic utterance.
According to ourremarks at the beginn of the section, we omit the re-actions of the system in the subsequent examples.By a group, we understand a collection of infor-mation that is orthogonal to other information.
By4The reader may recognize a certain similarity of the con-siderations in this section with the approach of (Grosz and Sid-ner, 1986).
An example: We restrict ourself to some remarks:Grosz & Sidner focus on the segmentation of discourse alongthe hierarchical structure of a task, while we focus on problemsconcerning repetition (this section) and variation of tasks (nextsection).
Grosz & Sidner are mainly concerned with anaphoricreference while we are concerned with ellipsis and related im-plicit inheritance of information.
In our approach, structuralrelations between information is as much important as aspectsconcerning the processing of tasks.
Furthermore, we discussproblems in relation to a special resolution mechanism, i.e., de-fault unification.Figure 1: Ontology for Searching Information aboutPerformances (simplified)orthogonal we mean independent and not ?compet-ing?.
For instance, we consider TIME, LOCATIONand CONTENT as basic groups of the informationthat belongs to a performance.
Independence is nota sufficient criterion.
Actor and genre are indepen-dent, but as our examples may show there are con-sidered as competing.
We have no formal means torecognize a group.
The knowledge about groups hasto be provided.We use the term information element (IE) of afeature structure as follows: An IE consists of twoparts: a role path and a semantic content.
Differingfrom the usual definition of paths (Carpenter, 1992),a role path is a sequence of alternating types andfeatures (T1F1...TnFn with Types Ti and Featuresfi).
The semantic content is expressed by the sub-structure which is identified by applying the subse-quence of the features of the role path (accordinglyto standard definition).
Role paths can be translateddirectly in an obvious way into feature structures.We speak of an terminal information element(TIE), if the substructure is a type without furtherspecification.
A TIE is atomic, if its semantic con-tent is atomic.
We represent TIEs as extended rolepaths by taking the type which expresses their se-mantic content as last element of the path.Two TIEs (or IEs) are of the same sort, if theirrole path has a common prefix.
Two TIEs are of thesame terminal sort, if their role paths are identical.TIE1 is more general as TIE2 if TIE1 subsumesTIE2.
TIE1 subsumes TIE2 if the subsumption re-lation holds between their translations to featurestructures.
It will turn out that this definition is tonarrow and does not cover the intuitive meaning ofbeing more general.The TIEs in elliptic expressions are usually lessspecific or have a shorter role path than the TIEsin the antecedent.
Subsequently we assume thatthe matching process (as described in former sec-tions) has already been applied and that the TIEs ofthe elliptic expression are extendend by appendingthe role path from the root of the antecedent to thematching node.
Otherwise we could not correctlydetermine if an IE is subsumed by another or if theybelong to the same group etc.We only consider readings of elliptic expressionsthat amount to a new request, ignoring other read-ings of elliptic expressions, e.g., as positive or neg-ative feedback.1 USER: Welch filme laufen heute Abend inSaarbru?cken?

(Arescience fiction movies among them?
)In (2) the general information movies(i.e., the TIE informationSearch:TOPIC:-performance?in?cinema:CONTENT:movie) isreplaced by the coresponding concrete informationcrime movies (i.e., the TIE informationSearch:-TOPIC:performance?in?cinema:CONTENT:-movie:GENRE:crime).
All other informationbelongs to different groups and is retained.
In (3)the information crime movies is replaced by infor-mation of the same terminal sort.
The specificationcrime movies is deleted.
GENRE is a set-valuedfeature.
Note that set-valued features act quitedifferently depending on the context (informationbrowsing vs. task specification).
If the informationcrime should be retained, this has to be indicated,e.g.
by an anaphorical relation to the result of query(2) as is done in (3b).
The reading of (2) and (3)is not affected by the form of the ellipsis, but thestrong indication of parallelism that is expressedwith ?Und Krimis?
(?And crime (movies)?)
seemsnot acceptable due to the proper subsumptionrelation between movies and movies with genrecrime.1 USER: Welche Science fiction laufen heuteabend in Saarbru?cken?.
(Which science fiction(movies) are on today evening at Saarbru?cken)4 USER:a Mit Bruce Willis?
(With Bruce Willis?
)b Und mit Bruce Willis / Welche filmemit Bruce Willis laufen (And with BruceWillis?
/ Which movies with Bruce Willisare on)In (4), the new information element Bruce Willisdoes not belong to the same terminal sort as any el-ement in the antecedent, but by contributing to thespecification of movies it belongs to the same groupas science fiction.
It is a competing element of ?sci-ence fiction?, and its effect on the information ele-ment ?science fiction?
is a mixture of the effect ofelements of the same sort and elements of a differ-ent group (as may be expected).
4b is an an accept-able utterance in this context and it has the effect ofdeleting the genre information, while 4a without ex-plicit ellipsis indication could also count as addinga specification.1 USER: Welche Krimis kommen heute abendin Saarbru?cken (Which crime (movies) are ontoday evening at saarbru?cken?
)5 USER:a Und in Saarlouis (And at Saarlouis?
)b Welche filme laufen in Saarlouis?
(Whichmovies are on at Saarlouis?
)In (5) the information Saarbru?cken is replaced byan information of the same terminal sort.
5a hasthe reading crime movies in Saarlouis.
In 5b crimemovies is replaced by a more general informa-tion.
This is an indication that the specificationcrime should be removed.
But Welche filme (whichmovies) has two other (less preferred) readings: ananaphoric reading which (of those) movies are (also)running at Saarlouis, or even an elliptic (or E-type)reading which crime movies are on at Saarlouis.That movie is more general than crime movie candirectly inferred from examining the ontology, i.e.by subsumption.1 USER: Welche Krimis kommen heute abend inSaarbru?cken (Which crime (movies) are on?
)6 USER:a Und im Scala (And at the Scala (movietheater))b Welche filme laufen im Scala (Whichmovies are on at the Scala movie theater)In (6), Saarbru?cken is replaced by a more concreteinformation of the sort location.
The Scala movietheater is expected to be in Saarbru?cken except forScala is a aforementioned cinema in another town.The readings are quite similar to (5).
But there isone difference: assume (1) gets an empty result.Than (5a) is still appropriate while (6a) is quite odd.
(5b remains (slightly) ambiguous, while (6b) hasonly one reading.
The problem with these findingsis, that we cannot recognize by subsumption thatScala is more specific than Saarbru?cken.In information browsing, the relations betweenthe information elements contained in the an-tecedent and the information elements provided bythe ellipsis expression are relevant for resolution.Concrete Information Rule If the elliptic expres-sion contains a more concrete TIE than the an-tecedent, old specifications that belong to an-other group are retained.General Information Rule If the elliptic expres-sion contains more general information thanthe antecedent, then the general informationtends to be understood as deleting the corre-sponding concrete Information.
The more gen-eral TIE introduces a choice points for defaultunification.
Default unification has to producea reading (usually the more likely one) that ac-cepts general information elements as potentialbarriers for default unification and removes oldinformation which is beyond the barriers.Same Sort Rule If the elliptic expression containsinformation of the same terminal sort, the oldinformation is deleted, even if the informationelements belong to a set-valued feature, exceptit is made explicit that the feature should beadded.Competing Information Rule If the elliptic ex-pression indicates parallelism and contains?competing?
information of the same group,but not the same terminal sort, the old infor-mation is deleted.
Otherwise, competing infor-mation can be understood as adding a furtherspecification.Negative Result Condition Ambiguous readingsare sensible for the result of the antecedentquery.
Negative (empty) results excludesreadings that make the specification moreconcrete.We only consider relations between an antecedentquery and a subsequent elliptic query.
We do notdiscuss here relations that come into play if a longerhistory is considered.
The examples show, that de-fault unification has to be controlled by relations be-tween information elements.6 Conclusion and ProblemsWe presented an approach for the resolution of non-parallel ellipsis by default uni?cation, which is in-herently a parallel method.
We discussed the de-pendence of ellipsis interpretation on the state ofthe dialog in respect to task processing, but alsoon relation between the informational content ofantecedent structures and elliptic structures, whichleads to a removal of inforamation, which is up tonow not considered in studies on ellipsis.
We alsoaddressed the interplay of these dependencies withindications of parallism that are customarily viewedas the main factors of ellipsis interpretation.
and Wedemonstrated how these insights are realized by us-ing default unification as efficient base processing.A topic of further research is the relation of gen-eral and concrete information.
For instance, the on-tology shown in figure 1 resembles the ontologyused in SmartKom.
The location of a cinema isspecified by using a common format for addresses,in which country and town are on the same leveland the name of the object not directly related to theaddress.
Formally (if groups are already defined)these informations would considered as competing.This would prevent the Scala movie theater to betransferred to Saarlouis (in most cases the compe-tition criterion would exclude this possibility, for acertain type of elliptic expression it would recog-nize an ambiguity).
But the criterion would alsodelete the specification that the Scala cinema isin Saarbru?cken if the information element Scala isintroduced elliptical after asking a question aboutSaarbru?cken.
This kind of problems is not exclu-sively a problem of locations.?
Wo la?uft Matrix?
(Where is Matrix on?)?
Western?
/ Wo laufen Western?
(Where arewestern (movies) onThe phrase ?Western?
shows no indications for par-allelism, hence the competition criterion would inthis case accept the reading that the user is lookingfor a western named Matrix.As a practical solution, we introduced a rule thatcomprises that names and other ?identifiers?
of indi-viduals are considered as being more concrete thanany other information elements, but further explo-ration of the problem is necessary.Also, the study of larger pieces of dialog as con-sidered here is an important topic of further re-search.At several occasions we noticed that anaphoricrelations interact with elliptic relation.
The inter-action of anaphors and ellipsis is another importanttopic of research.ReferencesJ.
