IR-NLI : AN EXPERT NATURAL LANGUAGE INTERFACE TO ONLINE DATA BASES(o)Giovanni Guida , Carlo Tasso (*)Istituto di Matematica, Informatica e SistemisticaUniversit~ di UdineVia Antonini,8 - 33100 Udine, ItalyABSTRACTConstructing natural language interfaces tocomputer systems often requires achievment of ad-vanced reasoning and expert capabilities in additionto basic natural language understanding.
In this pa-per the above issues are faced in the frame of anactual application concerning the design of a natu-ral language interface for the access to online in-formation retrieval systems.
After a short discus -sion of the peculiarities of this application, whichrequires both natural language understanding andreasoning capabilities, the general architecture andfundamental design criteria of a system presentlybeing developed at the University of Udine are thenpresented, The system, named IR-NLi, is aimed at al-lowing non-technical users to directly access throughnatural language the services offered by online da-ta bases.
Attention is later focused on the basicfunctions of IR-NLI, namely, understanding and dia-logue, strategy generation, and reasoning.
Knowledgerepresenetation methods and "~igorithms adopted arealso illustar~ed.
A short example of interactionwith IR-LNT~I is presented.
Perspectives and direcZionsfor future research are also discussed.I INTRODUCTIONNatural language processing has developed inthe last years in several directions that often gofar beyond the original goal of mapping natural laua-~uage expressions into formal internal representa -zions.
?roblems concerned with discourse modeling,reasoning about beliefs, knowledge and wants ofspeaker and hearer, expiicitely dealing with goals,plans, and speech acts are only a few of the topics~f current interest in the field.
This paper is con-:erned with one ~spect of natural language processingthat we name here reasoning, it is intended as a ba-sic ?
ctivity in natural language comprehension thatis aimed at capturing spes/~er's goals and inten -tions that often lie behind the mere literal mea-ning of the utterance.
In this work we explore themain implications of reasoning in the frame of anacttu&l application which is concerned with the na-tttral language acees to online information retrie-val services (Politt,1981; Waterman,1978).In particular, we shall present the detaileddesign of a system, named IR-NLI (Information Re-trieval Natural Language Interface), that is beingdeveloped at the University of Udine and we shalldiscuss its main original features.
The topic ofnatural language reasoning is first shortly i!lu-strated from a conceptual point of view and compa-red to related proposals.
The main features of thechosen application domain are then described andthe specifications of ~R-NLI are stated.
We laterturn to the architecture of the system and we gofturther into a detailed account of the structure ofits knowledge bases and of its mode of operation.Particular attention id devoted to the three funda-mental modules STARTEGY GENERATOR, REASONING, ~ndUNDERSATNDING AND DIALOGUE.
A sample search sessionwith IR-NLI concludes the illustarion of the pro-ject.
A critical evaluation of the work is zhen pre-sented, and main lines of the future development ~fthe project are outlined with particular ~tent ionto original research issues.II NATURAL LANGUAGE UIi~ERST?S4DING .~ND REASONI:~GResearch in natural langage precessin 6 has re-come in the last years  a highly multiiisciplinzrytopic, in which artificial inteliigence, computatio-nal linguistic, cognitive science, psycholo~- , ~nzlogic share a wide set of common intrests, in tniaframe, reasoning i~ not a new issue.
The meaningthat we attach to this te rm in the zontex~ ~f this\ [~  R?~o with : Milan Polytechnic Artificial Intelligence Project, Milano, Italy.'
~ ~iso with : CISM, International Center for Mechanical Sciences, Udine, Italy.31work is, nevertheless original.
We distinguish inthe natural language comprehension activity betweena surface comprehension that only aims at represen-ting the literal content of a natural language ex -pression into a formal internal representation, anda leap comprehension that moves beyond surface mea-ning to capture the goals ~nd intentions which liebehind the utterance (Grosz,1979; Hobbs,1979; Allen,?errault,1980).
The process that brings from surfa-ce to deep comprehension is just what we name herereasonin~ activity.
Differntly from Winograd (1980),reasoning is not , in our model, something that ta-kes place after understanding is completed and aimsat developing deductions on facts ~nd concepts%cquired.
Reasoning is a basic paz~c of deep compre-hension and involves not only linguistic capabili-ties ~understanding and dialogue) but also deduc -tion, induction, analogy, generalization, etc., oncommon sense and domain specific knowledge.
Figurepresents a graphic representation of the basicrelationships betwe=n understanding and reasoning,and clearly shows how reasoning moves the internalrepresentation of an utterance from a first point,zorresponding to surface eoprehension, to a secondDne that represents ~eep comprehension.in the application of online information retrie-val that we face in this work,the above concepts are:~nsi!ered in the fr%me of man-machine commLLnica -:ion, and reasoning will mostly be concerned withterrsinolo~j, as we shall further explore in the nextsection.SPEAi(!

INFO2MATION RETRIEVALin :his section we present an application domain;here the topic of natural language reasoning playsfundamental role, namely, natural language accessto online information retrieval services.
As it iswell known, online services allow interested userszo solve information problems by selecting and re-~riev~ng reievant io~uments stored in very large bi-bilogr%phic sr f~ctual data bases.
3enerail~" end-usersire unwilling o r  unable\] ~o serach ~ersonai!y andiirectly access these large files, but they Dftenrely 3n the ~ssistanee ~f e skilful information pro-fessional, the intermediary, who h.ws how tc selecte~prtpriate data bases end hr.. to design good search~%artegies for the retrieval of the desired informa-tion, and how ~o impiement them in e suitable formalluery !an~/age.
Usually, the interaction between end-~=er %n~ intermediary begins ~ith ~ presearch inter-vlew aimed e~ precisely clarifying the content andt .e Db.jecti'zes of nhe information need.
On tha basezf the information gathered, the inzeremdiary chooses32the most suitable data bases and, with the nei~ :fseraching referr~l aids such ~s thesauri, iirecnc-ties, etc., he devises the search ~trate~# no 0eexecuted by the information retrieval system.
Theoutput of the search is then evaluated by the end-user, who may propose K refinemen~ ~nd an interac-tion of the search for better matching hi3 requests.We claim that the intermediary's task representsa good example of the issues of natur~i ian~aage rea-soning, part~icularly for what concerns the ebliity ~funderstanding natural language user'3 :'equest~ an!
;:'reasoning on their linguistic and aemanzlz z'..nn:e~in order :o fully :~pture user's nears ~nd gczl~.Besides, it has to be stressed that ~he intermedizrvshould also posses other important skills, nh..: i_expertise ~nd precise knowledge ~bout ia~a ba~e can-tent, organization, and indexing criteria, abcu~availability and use of searching referral ai!s,abButsystem query languages and ~coess procedures, zndlast about how %o plot ~nd construct en adequatesearch strategy.
The above illustrated :hrzcteriszlcsmotivate the design of a natural Language expert ~y-stem for interfacing online ~ata bases.
3n fact, the!R-NLI project has among its long term goals the i~plementation of a system to be interposed between theend-user and the information retrieval system, capable of fully substituting the intermediary's role.IV THE IR-NLI SYSTEMIR-NLI is conceived as an interactive interfaceto online information retrieval system suppoz~ingEnglish language interaction.
It should be able tomanage a dialogue with the user on his informationneeds and to construct an appropiate search strategy.More precisely, IR-NLI is aimed at meeting the needsof non-technical users who are not acqua/nted with online searching.
For this purpose three different ca-pabilities are requested.
First, the system has tobe an expert of online searching,i.e, it must embedknowledge of the intermediary's professional skill.Second, it must be able of understanding natural lan-guage and of carrying on the dialogue with the user.Third, it has to be capable of reasoning on langua-ge in order to capture the information needs of theuser and to formulate them with appropriate terms ina given formal query language.In the current first phase of the project wehave considered a set of working hypotheses for IR-NLI :- it operates on just one data base;- it utilizes only one query language;- it refers to only one subject domain;- it is conceived only for off-line use without in-teraction with the data base during the searchsession.fire suitable sequences of understanding, dialogue,and reasoning functions until the internal repre.-sentation of the user's requests is completely ex-panded and validated.The UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE module is devo-ted to perform activities mostly of linguistic con-cern.
First, it has to translate the natural langu-age user's requests into a basic formal internal re-presentation (IR).
Second, it manages the dialoguewith the user by generating appropriate queries andby translating his replays,thus expanding the IR withnew information.
The UNDERSTANDING AND DIAILGUE ~o-dule utilizes for its operation a base of lin~uiszickno.led~e (LK).The REASONING module is aimed at reasoning onIR in order to enlarge its content with all the in-formation required to generate an appropiate searchstrate~\[.
It utilizes for this task a base of domainspecific knowledge (DSK).The FORMALIZER module, after the STRATEGY GEf~-RATOR has completed its activity, constructs fromthe IR the output search s t ra~e~ to be executed foraccessing the online data base.
The FORMALIZER utilizes for its operation knowledge about the formal fanguage needed to interrogate the online data base andoperates through a simple syntax-directed schema, itis conceived as a parametric translator capableof producing search strategies in several languagesfor accessing online services, such as SDC ORBIT,Euronet DIANE, Lockheed DIALOG, etc."!
SYSTSM ARCHITECTUREThe general architecture designed for the IR-NLI system is shown in Figure 2.
The kernel of thesystem is constituted by the 3~dEI'ZGY GENERATOR ,which is devoted to devise the top-level choices con-zerning the overall operation of the syszem and to:cntroi their execution.
It utilizes for it~ acti-"'ity a base 3f expert knowledge (E~K) which concernsthe evaluation of user's requests, the managament3f the presearch interview, the selection of a sui-table approach for ~eneration of the search strate-gy, and ~uheduling of the activities of the lowerLevel modules :~ERSTAINDING AND DIALOGUE, REASONING,and FORMALIZER.
The operation of the STRATEGY GENERA-TOR is organized around a basic sequence of steps,each taking into ~ccount a differnt subset of ex-pert rules, that r%ppiy tO different situations and33.

Functions and knowledge bases ~:" \[R-~\[L2.Vl  KNOWLEDGE BASESIn this section we shall illustrate the mainfeatures of the three knowledge bases utilized bythe IE-NLI system.Let us begin with DSK.
The purpose of this kno Kledge base is to store information about the domaincovered by the online data base to which IR-NLI re-fers.
This information presents two ~spects : a se -mant ic  facet concerning what concepts are in the da-ta base and how they relate to each other, and a lin-guistic one concerning how the concepts are curren-tly eta'pressed through appropriate termS.
The struc-ture of DSK proposed reflects and generalizes to~ome extent that of classical searching referralaids (in particular, thesauri and subject classi-fications).
At a logical level, it is constitutedby a labelled directed network in which nodes re-present concepts and directed arcs represent rela-tions between concepts.
Each node contains a ~erm.,a fla~ denoting whether the term is controlled ornot, a field that stores the post in~ count, i.e.the number of items in the data base in which theterm appear, and a level number which representsthe degree of specificity of ~he term in a hirar-:hical subject classification.
Arcs g'n~erai!y denotethe usual cross-reference relationships utilizedfor struc=uring thesauri; e.g., BT (broader term),(narrower term), RT (related term), UF (used for).In addition, arcs of type ne~ are provided that al-Low, in connection with the level numbers of nodes,sequential scanning of the knowledge base accor-iing to the currently utilized hierarchical subject~iassification.
This s~ructure is conceived to beilrec~ly obtained (possibly in a partially automa-tic way ~hrough appropriate data conversion programs)from ~vailable searching referral aids and onlinethesauri.Le~ us turn now to LK.
This knowledge base is~imed at supplying all information concerning natu-ral language ~ha~ is needed to understand user's re-luests.
According to the mode of operation of =he'XDERSTANDING A~D DIALOGUE module (see section IX),it 2on%ains the lexicon of the application domainwhich is currently considered.
Each record of thelexicon 2ontains ~ word of =he language, its sem:~n-t~2 ~2~.~e concept,  ~onnec~ive, f'anction~, ~nd its~e%nin~.
The semantic type denotes ~he role ~f %~ord in a sentence; namely:- ienoting ~ term of zhe da=a base;- iefining z parz icuiar relation between different2.\]nc~ta in user's requests;- specifying ~ particular function that the user ie-~ires ~o obtain from the information re.ri_,al~ =z~ystem.The meaning 9f R word may be expressed zs ~ pointer34to a term of the DSK in the case of a word of typeconcept, as a special purpose procedure in ~he ca-se of a connective or a f~nc:ion.Let us note that,in order to avoid ~nusefulduplication of informa=ion in =he DSK and LK, a sha-red directory of en~r y words may be u~iiized f~rboLh bases.The purpose of EK is to contain informationtha= concerns the professional expertise of the in-termediary on how to manage a search session in 0r-der to appropriately satisfy the information needsof the end-user.

theexecution of a search approach through applicationof appropriate ~earch tactics.Within IR-NLI, a search approach is represen-ted as an al~orithm that defines which tactics toutilize, among the available ones, and how to usethem in the construction of a s~rate~.
An approachis not however a fixed procedure, since it does not~pecify at each step which paz~cicular tactic toexecute, but only suggests a set of candidate tac-tics, whose execution may or may not be fired.Tactics are represented at two different levelsof abstraction :- an high-level representation <name, objectives>provided for ~se by the STRATEGY GENERATOR;- a low-level representation <name,reasoning actions>supplied for use by the REASONING modLtle.About ~5 tactics ~re considered, taken from the ve-ry rich discussion by Bates (\]979) : CORRECT, CUT,SELECT, EXHAUST, .REDUCE, PARALLEL, PINPOINT, BLOCK,$b~ER, SUB, RELATE, NEIGHBOUR, FIX, RESPELL, RESPA-2Z, etc.The operation of the STRATEGY GENERATOR is ba-sically pattern-directed; namely, the particularactivities to be performed and the way in which UN-DERSTANDING ~D DIALOGUE and REASONING modules areactivated are determined by the content of the cur-rent IR *or of some par~cs of i~), which is matchedwith zn appropriate subset of the exper~ rules.

program :The REASONING module operates on the IR ani zaaimed at precisely capturing user's ~cals ~nd neelathrough deductive and inferenniai processes.
Morespecifically, the REASONING uodule has the main~a~k of executing the tactics fired by the S.-?..ATE-GY GENERATOR.
Hence, from this point cf view, it35represents the actuator of the reasoning processdevised by the STRATEGY GENERATOR.It utilizes the low-level representation ofthe tactics, which specifies suitable reasoning ac-tions expressed in terms of :- accessing DSK;- updating the I~ with the new information.Among the basic capabilitis of the ~ESONING mo-dule we consider generalization to broader terms,extension to related concepts, particularizationto narrower terms, analysis of synonymi and homo-nymi, etc.
its operation is based on special-pur-pose procedures that correspond to the reasoningactions involved in the tactics.
Furthermore,when an action has to be performed on IR for ex-tending its content, validation may be requestedfrom the user in order to ensure a correct mat-zhing betvwen his wants and system proposals.
Thisis done through the U~DERSTANDING AND DIALOGUE mo-lule which has to gather user's agreement aboutthe new terms to be introduced in the IR.ZX U~DERSTA/~DING .~D DIALOGUEZdr.e purpose of the UNDERSTANDING AND DIALOGUEmodule is twofold :- =o ~ranslate user~ requests into IR;- to generate ~ueries to the user and to understandhis ~nswers, i.e.
