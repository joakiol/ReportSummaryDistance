Since the models used are typi-cally black boxes, they give little insight intothe stylistic differences they detect.
In thispaper, we characterize two prose genres syn-tactically: chick lit (humorous novels on thechallenges of being a modern-day urban fe-male) and high literature.
First, we developa top-down computational method based onexisting literary-linguistic theory.
Using anoff-the-shelf parser we obtain syntactic struc-tures for a Dutch corpus of novels and measurethe distribution of sentence types in chick-litand literary novels.
The results show that liter-ature contains more complex (subordinating)sentences than chick lit.
Secondly, a bottom-upanalysis is made of specific morphological andsyntactic features in both genres, based on theparser?s output.
This shows that the two gen-res can be distinguished along certain features.Our results indicate that detailed insight intostylistic differences can be obtained by com-bining computational linguistic analysis withliterary theory.1 IntroductionThe gap between literary theory and computationalpractice is still great.
Despite pleas for a more inte-grated approach (e.g., Ramsay, 2003), and sugges-tions from literary theorists (e.g., Roque, 2012), lit-erary theory is more often used for illustrative orexplicative purposes, rather than as a basis for com-putational analysis.
The hermeneutic nature of mostliterary theory is a valid cause for caution, as it is notTOPSMAINNP-SUVNW-DETZijnN-HDkaaklijnWW-HDisAP-PREDCBW-MODbijnaADJ-HDvierkantLET.Figure 1: A sentence from ?Zoek Het Maar Uit?

discursive arguments into the strictrules a computer needs.
Too many intermediary stepsare required, if a translation is possible at all.We therefore take a different approach in this paper.Instead of building on hermeneutic theory, we use aliterary-linguistic theory about syntactic structuresas a basis for developing a computational methodfor prose genre analysis; in this paper we will focuson chick-lit and literary novels.
Because of this tightconnection between theory and method, these usuallyseparate sections are combined.
In addition to thistop-down approach, we report bottom-up findingsbased on syntactic features encountered in the data.These complementary results will be used to furtheranalyze and interpret genre differences, as opposedto author style.
Our aim is not text categorization,but to describe the genres from a syntactic point ofview.We have chosen the genres of chick lit and litera-ture, because many readers have intuitive notions ondifferences between them.
In this paper we want tofind out whether it is possible to retrace these notions72in syntactic properties of the texts, by addressing thefollowing questions: (i) are there differences in thedistribution of sentence types between chick lit andliterary novels, (ii) is the intuitive notion that chick litis easier to read reflected in a tendency towards sim-ple sentence structures rather than complex ones?
Inanswering these questions, two methodological goalsare achieved simultaneously: we discover how a spe-cific literary-linguistic theory can be transformed toa computational method and we explore how wellthe output of a statistical parser facilitates such aninvestigation.This study is a first exploration in a project calledThe Riddle of Literary Quality,1 which aims to findpatterns in the texts of Dutch current-day novels,that relate to the distinction between high-brow andlow-brow literature.
Deep syntactic structures as re-searched in the present paper are an important aspectof this investigation.2 Theory and methodAccording to linguists Leech and Short (1981) syn-tactic structure is one of the grammatical featuresthat can be taken into account when analyzing thestyle of prose texts.
To this end, they make a divi-sion between six basic sentence types, from simpleto parenthetic.Toolan (2010) applies their theory by close-readinga paragraph from a short story by Alice Munro.
Hesuggests that the six sentence types are part of a hi-erarchy of increasing complexity, a notion we willexplore further by taking a distant reading approach,namely syntactically analyzing a prose corpus.
Inrecent computational work on syntactic stylistics byFeng et al(2012) and van Cranenburgh (2012) com-putational explorations of deep syntactic structures inacademic and literary writing styles are undertakenon a similar scale.
They make use of a machine learn-ing methodology in which the results are evaluatedon objective criteria, in this case authorship.In line with this previous research we want to ex-amine whether the use of certain types of sentencestructures can inform our understanding of the dif-ference between two prose genres, chick lit and lit-erature.
As opposed to Feng et al(2012) however,we do not rely on black box machine learning ap-1Cf.
http://literaryquality.huygens.knaw.nlproaches.
And instead of extracting arbitrary syntac-tic patterns as in van Cranenburgh (2012), we targetspecific syntactic features, based partially on literary-linguistic theory as well as manual exploration of thedata.
To be more specific, the computational tools weemploy deliver syntactic structures by querying thestructures for certain syntactic features.
During thedevelopment of our method, we continually verifyour intuitions against the actual data.To categorize the sentences into types, we devisetwo classifications, based on a combination of thetheory developed by Leech and Short (1981) andToolan (2010) and computational tests in Feng et al(2012).Class I1.
Simple: one main clause, no subordinationon any level in the parse tree2.
Compound: coordination of sentence-levelclauses, no subordination on any level3.
Complex: subordination anywhere in thesentence, no top-level coordination4.
Complex-compound: coordination on top-level and subordinationLeech and Short?s definition does not specify whethernon-finite or relative clauses that modify nounphrases count towards being a complex sentence.
Ac-cording to the ANS (2013), the Dutch standard ref-erence work on grammar, all sentences with morethan one connection between a subject and predicateare ?composed,?
thus not ?singular?
or simple.
Wetherefore choose to count all subordinating clausesas making a sentence complex.See (1)?
(4) for examples of each sentence type.2An (L) indicates a sentence from the literature corpus,and a (C) a sentence from the chick lit corpus.Simple sentence:(1) a. Sjaak schraapte zijn keel.
(L)Sjaak cleared his throat.b.
Mijn kniee?n voelen als pudding.
(C)My knees feel like jelly.Compound sentence:(2) Ik had dood kunnen zijn en niemand deed iets.
(C)I could have died and no one did anything.2These are examples from the novels in our corpus; cf.
ta-ble 1.73Complex sentence:(3) Ik weet ook niet waarom ik op van die hoge hakkenga shoppen.
(C)I really don?t know why I go shopping on such highheels.Complex-compound sentence:(4) Suzan had een vaag gezoem gehoord terwijl ze bezigwas in de keuken en had voor de zekerheid de deuropengedaan.
(L)Suzan had heard a vague buzzing while she was busyin the kitchen and had opened the door to be safe.The second classification describes the distributionof several types of complex sentences, based onToolan?s hierarchical ordering of complex sentencetypes.
This concerns sentences consisting of a depen-dent and main clause at the top level:Class II1.
Trailing: main clause followed by subordi-nating clause2.
Anticipatory: subordinating clause fol-lowed by main clause3.
Parenthetic: subordinating clause interrupt-ing a main clauseToolan argues that the complex sentences, especiallythe anticipatory and parenthetic ones, are more de-manding to process than the simple and compoundsentences, because of a disruption in the linear clause-by-clause processing (Toolan, 2010, p. 321).This can be explained by two principles: (1)the principle that theme precedes rheme (originallycalled ?Behaghel?s second law?)
and (2) the ?complex-ity principle?
(originally ?Law of increasing terms?
)(Behaghel, 1909).
The first principle concerns thecontent: the less informative or important elementsare placed before what is important or new.
Usually,the new information is introduced by the subordinateclause and is therefore placed after the main clause.The second principle argues that generally the morecomplex and longer elements??heavier?
constituentscontaining more words and elaborate syntax?tend tobe placed at the end of the sentence (Behaghel, 1909;Bever, 1970).
These principles also apply to Dutch;cf.
Haeseryn (1997, p. 308) and ANS (2013).
Withrespect to the content and syntactic dependency, sub-ordinate clauses are more demanding and complex,thus at best in this final position.Trailing sentence(5) Bo is te dik, omdat Floor hem macaroni voert.Bo is too fat, because Floor feeds him macaroni.Anticipatory sentence(6) Omdat Floor Bo macaroni voert, is hij te dik.Because Floor feeds Bo macaroni, he is too fat.Parenthetic sentence(7) Bo is, omdat Floor hem macaroni voert, te dik.Bo, because Floor feeds him macaroni, is too fat.We parse the corpus with the Alpino parser (Boumaet al 2001; van Noord, 2006) to obtain syntacticparse trees (e.g., figure 1).
The output of Alpino is inthe form of dependency trees, containing both syn-tactic categories and grammatical functions.
In orderto work with tools based on constituency trees, weconvert any non-local dependencies to discontinuousconstituents, and apply the transformation describedby Boyd (2007) to resolve discontinuities.
For exam-ple, the Dutch equivalent of a phrasal verb such as?Wake [NP] up?
might be parsed as a discontinuousVP constituent, but will be split up into two sepa-rate constituents VP*0 and VP*1, bearing an implicitrelation encoded in the label.In order to categorize the parsed sentences in ClassI and II, we build two different sets of queries: onefor the trees wherein the main clause is a direct childof the TOP-node, and another for the parsed treesthat introduce an extra node (DU) between the TOPand the main clause.
The former are the ?regular?sentences that comprise approximately 67 % of thecorpus, the latter are the so-called ?discourse units?
(DUs) that comprise 33 %.
DUs incorporate exten-sions to the sentence nucleus; cf.
(8a) and (8b), con-structions which depend on discourse relations (8c),and implicit conjunctions (8d).

Categories for main clauses: SMAIN (declaratives), SV1(verb initial: imperatives, polar questions) and WHQ (wh-questions).2.
Categories for finite subordinate clauses: SSUB (V-final),WHSUB (constituent questions), and (WH)REL (relativeclauses).3.
Categories for non-finite subordinate clauses: PPART (per-fect tense), INF (bare infinitives), TI (to-infinitives), andOTI (?om te?
+ inf) when accompanied by the BODY-function.
Without BODY, PPART and INF can also bepart of a simple sentence.4.
Functions used with DU: DP (discourse part), NUCL (sen-tence nucleus) SAT (?satellite?

?, ?you know?
?, dialogue markers: ?he said?, etc.
)The query language used is TGrep2 (Rohde, 2005).For example, we identify simple sentences using thefollowing query:TOP !< DU < ( /SMAIN|SV1|WHQ/ !< /CONJ/ )!<< /WHSUB|SSUB|(PPART|TI|INF)-BODY/This query matches a TOP node which does not havea DU child, but does have a SMAIN, SV1, or WHQchild.
This child, in turn, must not have one of thecategories signifying a conjunction or subordinateclause, at any level.3The Alpino treebank annotation uses the terminology ofnucleus and satellite, originally from Rhetorical Structure The-ory (Mann and Thompson, 1988).chick lit literatureno.

table 1.These novels were selected from a collection ofebooks; the number of each set was restricted bythe number of chick-lit novels available.

A salient detail is that the literary novels tooksignificantly longer to parse than the chick-lit nov-els (p = 0.0001), which cannot be attributed solelyto longer sentence length, because the difference re-mains when correcting for the cubic time complexityof parsing?viz.

The queriescould classify approximately 60 % out of the 67 %regular sentences and 24.5 % out of the of 33 %discourse units into one of these four basic sentencetypes.
Since DU-sentences often contain multiplemain clauses without an explicit form of conjunction,it is difficult to define when a sentence is a compoundrather than a complex sentence.
Therefore we do notdistinguish between compound and non-compoundfor complex DU-sentences, cf.
?DU complex?
intable 3.The remaining 15.5 % of the sentences in our cor-pus cannot be classified by our queries and wouldtherefore fall into a residual category.
This is (proba-bly) due to single-word and verbless sentence frag-ments that do not fit into any of the categories andare therefore not captured by any of the formulatedqueries.chick lit % lit.

In the discourse type-sentences DU complex(both with and without coordination) does show asignificant difference.
DU complex predicts genreadequately (p = 0.003; cf.
figure 4), indicating thatdialogue sentences might be a better predictor forgenre differences than narrative sentences.The results for Class II identification can be foundin table 4.
Although the difference is not signifi-cant, in chick lit we do find a tendency towards theuse of more trailing sentences, as opposed to moreanticipatory sentences in literary novels.
The dif-ference in use of parenthetic structure is significant4When taking a closer look at the constituents, the TI, OTIand BODY-INF clauses are the exception, because they are moreoften used in chick-lit novels.
TI and OTI introduce to-infinitives,e.g., I want to sleep, and the BODY-INFs are bare infinitiveclauses.
These three are the least complex of the subordinatingclauses.76chick lit % lit.

(p = 0.014), but because of the negligible number ofoccurrences, this is not a reliable predictor.
Relatingthese results to Toolan?s theory that sentence types ofLeech and Short are ordered according to increasingcomplexity?i.e., that anticipatory and parentheticsentences are more demanding to process and there-fore more complex?this tendency could be an indi-cator of a measurably higher syntactic complexity inliterary novels.In sum, although not significantly different for reg-ular sentences, the Class I and II identification showthat the genres tend to differ in the distribution ofsentence types and complexity.
With more data, theother tests may show significant differences as well.Especially the complex discourse units are good pre-dictors of the two genres.
This is crucial as DUs ingeneral appear to be characteristic of narrative text,which typically contain extensive dialogue and infor-mal speech.
However, not all dialogue is identified asa discourse unit, because we did no preprocessing toidentify all sentences in quoted speech as being partof dialogue.
Therefore, the actual amount of dialogueper novel remains unclear.5 Results on morphosyntactic featuresIn addition to to the deep syntactic results based onthe top-down approach, we take a closer look at thesyntactic categories in the generated trees.
The re-sults can be found in figure 3 and table 5.5.1 Relative clausesFigure 5 shows a substantial difference in the num-ber of relative clauses used in literature and chick lit(p=0.0005).
Relative clauses modify noun phrasesto describe or identify them.
Therefore the relativeclause makes the NP ?heavier?.

When the NP is a subject, this causes the headnoun of the NP to be distant from the main verb:(9) De mensen [REL die even eerder nog zo rustig op de vloerhadden zitten mediteren ], sprongen nu dansend en schree-uwend om elkaar heen.
(L)The people who just moments before had been meditatingquietly on the floor, were now jumping around each otherdancing and screaming.The relative clause interrupts the relation between thesubject and the predicate, but to a lesser extent than ina parenthetic sentence structure.
With relative clausesthere is also a disruption of the expected informationflow, and this contributes to making such sentencesmore complex to process (Gibson, 1998).Furthermore, the higher number of relative clausesin the literary novels makes the sentences more elab-orate.
In Chick lit: the new woman?s fiction Wellsargues a similar point to make a distinction betweenthe genres:?
[T]he language of chick-lit novels is unremark-able, in a literary sense.
Richly descriptive or poeticpassages, the very bread and butter of literary nov-els, both historical and contemporary, are virtuallynonexistent in chick lit.?
(Wells, 2005, p. 65)5.2 Prepositional phrasesGiven the longer average sentence length of literature,it is to be expected that the prepositional phrases (PPs;as well as noun phrases; NPs) occur more frequentlyin literary novels than in chick lit (p = 0.0044 and770 5 10 15 20Percentage of sentencesGastel,_Chantal_van_-_Zoek_het_maar_uitGastel,_Chantal_van_-_Zwaar_verliefdHarrewijn,_Astrid_-_In_zeven_slotenHarrewijn,_Astrid_-_LuchtkussenHollander,_Wilma_-_Bouzouki_BoogieHollander,_Wilma_-_Dans_der_liefdeHollander,_Wilma_-_Onder_de_Griekse_zonMiddelbeek,_Mariette_-_Revanche_in_New_YorkMiddelbeek,_Mariette_-_Single_En_SexyMiddelbeek,_Mariette_-_Status_O.K.Verkerk,_Anita_-_Als_een_zandkorrel_in_de_windVerkerk,_Anita_-_Bedrogen_liefdeVerkerk,_Anita_-_Cheesecake__KiltsVerwoert,_Rianne_-_MatchVerwoert,_Rianne_-_Schikken_of_stikkenVerwoert,_Rianne_-_Trouw_en_Beijnum,_Kees_Van_-_De_OrdeningBeijnum,_Kees_van_-_De_oesters_van_Nam_KeeDorrestein,_Renate_-_Een_sterke_manDorrestein,_Renate_-_Hart_van_steenDorrestein,_Renate_-_Het_hemelse_gerechtEnquist,_Anna_-_De_ThuiskomstEnquist,_Anna_-_De_VerdoversEnquist,_Anna_-_Het_meesterstukGlastra_van_Loon,_Karel_-_De_PassievruchtGlastra_van_Loon,_Karel_-_Lisa_s_AdemGrunberg,_Arnon_-_De_AsielzoekerGrunberg,_Arnon_-_Huid_en_haarJapin,_Arthur_-_De_grote_wereldJapin,_Arthur_-_VaslavMoor,_Margriet_de_-_De_Schilder_en_het_MeisjeMoor,_Margriet_de_-_De_verdronkenechicklitliterature7.8 7.26.4 6.99.0 9.29.4 9.57.0  8.64.5  6.49.1 8.36.0  9.611.510.411.6 9.614.1 9.29.4 10.99.910.615.2 8.611.8 18.713.7 15.97.6 11.5mean for genre (std.

The aforementioned argu-ment by Wells that chick lit is less descriptive thanliterature is reflected in the results of the PPs and NPsas well.
PPs, especially PP-adjuncts?grammaticallyoptional constituents that function as modifiers ofother constituents?are also indicative of descriptivelanguage.
Example (10) shows liberal use of preposi-tional phrases, including the first two PP-MODs thatmodify the same constituent?although the latter wasnot attached correctly by the parser.
(10) Ineens had ik zin om te schreeuwen en de gerookte zalmen quiches van tafel te slaan, [PP-MOD maar [MWU-HD inplaats daarvan]] troostte ik me [PP-PC met de wietzolder[PP-MOD van [N-OBJ1 Emiel]], [PP-MOD met [NP-OBJ1de gedachte dat ik nog meer geheimen had en dat het be-haaglijk kon zijn]] [NP-OBJ1 het slappe geklets [PP-MODvan [N-OBJ1 anderen]] te verachten] (L)Suddenly I felt an urge to scream and throw the smoakedsalmon and quiches off the table, but instead I consoledmyself with the weed attic of Emiel, with the idea that Ihad yet more secrets and that it could be comfortable todespise the petty banter of others.In sum, both the relative clauses and the PPs dif-ferentiate between literature and chick lit and pointtowards more descriptive language in literature.5.3 DiminutivesAnother marker for the distinction between chicklit and literature is the use of diminutives (almostsignificant, p=0.055).
In Dutch, the diminutive isa productive part of the language and is typicallyformed by the suffix ?-je?.
Alpino marks such wordswith the morphological feature ?dim.?
The frequentuse of the diminutive is a common element in col-loquial speech, and aside from the literal meaningof smallness diminutives are also used to expressendearment, intimacy, and familiarity:(11) Ik draai me om en pak mijn telefoontje.
(C)I turn around and take my telephone-dim.This may indicate that language in chick lit is closerto real-life speech than that of literature and could beexplored further when the speech-narrative distinc-tion is operationalized.6 DiscussionA starting point for further exploration is offered byour finding that the complex DU-sentences clearlydifferentiate between chick lit and literature.
Some-thing similar is suggested by Egbert (2012), who usesMulti-Dimensional analysis to explore literary styles.He identifies stylistic variation in the dimensions ofThought Presentation versus Description, and Dia-logue versus Narrative.
This finding supports our con-clusion that it would be fruitful to pursue an intratex-tual distinction of regular versus dialogue sentences.In future research the method could for instance beexpanded by using a discourse analyzer to identify alldialogue sentences.
This will require some notion ofa text grammar (Nunberg, 1990; Power et al 2003),to recognize the different ways in which dialogue canbe represented in text.In order to assess the fitness of statistical parsersfor literary investigations, a more comprehensivestudy of the quality of the parse trees is in order.
Thetrees we have inspected were overall of good qual-ity, especially concerning the elements we analyze.These consist mostly of overtly marked syntactic con-stituents, and do not hinge on correct attachments,which are often difficult to get right for statisticalparsers.Furthermore, we would like to investigate Toolan?sclaims about the complexity of sentence types, andon more specific morphosyntactic features.
Unfor-tunately, little theory exists on syntactic aspects ofliterature, let ale its complexity.
This could beimproved by using results from psycholinguistics onwhat kinds of syntactic constructions are perceivedas complex.
Related to this is the work concerningreadability measures, such as the Flesch and Kin-caid scales, which can be obtained with the styleprogram (Cherry and Vesterman, 1981).Finally, in future work we would like to combineour computational results with literary interpretation.This requires attending to the context of the syntacticfeatures in question.7 ConclusionWe have operationalized a literary-linguistic theoryby employing several computational tools and foundspecific syntactic features that characterize the twoprose genres.
Especially the Discourse Units showed79a marked difference between the genres: chick lituses more compound sentences, whereas literaturecontains more complex sentences.
The bottom-uptests showed that chick-lit writers use significantlymore diminutives, whereas literary writers employmore prepositional phrases and relative clauses whichresults in more descriptive language.Although these findings agree with intuitive no-tions that literature employs more complex syntac-tic constructions than chick lit, computational anal-ysis has proven its added value.
The distant readingmethod of sifting through large amounts of text canreveal patterns too subtle or diffused to spot withoutcomputational tools; the distribution of the specificsentence structures we have investigated here wouldhave been cumbersome to extract manually.Our approach of analyzing syntactic featuresyields promising results on characterizing prosegenre and explaining the syntactic differences.
Thepositive results mean that the method that we haveapplied can be developed further in the context ofthe project The Riddle of Literary Quality to findout whether syntactic complexity correlates with theperceived aesthetic quality of the texts as well.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Isaac Sijaranamual for supplyingus with a collection of ebooks and timely advice onpre-processing, and to Emy Koopman for suggestionson statistical matters.
