upenn, edu steedman?cis, upenn, edu)ABSTRACTThis paper presents a model for generating prosodically ap-propriate synthesized responses to database queries usingCombinatory Categorial Grammar  (CCG - cf.
\[22\]), a for-malism which easily integrates the notions of syntactic on-stituency, prosodic phrasing and information structure.
Themodel determines accent locations within phrases on the ba-sis of contrastive sets derived from the discourse structureand a domain- independent  k owledge base.1.
In t roduct ionPrevious work in the area of intonation generation i -cludes an early study by Young and Fallside (\[26\]), andstudies by Terken (\[24\]), Houghton, Isard and Pearson(cf.
\[11, 12\]), Davis and Hirschberg (cf.
\[4, 10\]), andZacharski et ah (\[27\]).
The present proposal differsfrom the earlier studies in the accent assignment rules,and in the representation f information structure andits relation to syntax and semantics.
In the CCG frame-work, the information units that are delineated by in-tonation are directly represented, complete with seman-tic interpretations.
These interpretations are utilized inmaking accent placement decisions on the basis of con-trastive properties rather than previous-mention heuris-tics: While such heuristics have proven quite effectivein the earlier studies, we believe the model-theoretic ap-proach taken here will eventually lead to the develop-ment of similar heuristics for handling a wider range ofexamples involving contrastive stress.The remainder of the paper discusses the contrastivestress model, describes the implemented system, andpresents results demonstrating the system's ability togenerate a variety of intonational possibilities for a given* Preliminary versions of some sections in the present paper werepublished as \[17\] and \[lS\].

Mot ivat ionMeaning-to-speech systems differ from text-to-speechsystems in the manner in which semantic and pragmaticinformation is exploited for assigning intonational fea-tures.
Text-to-speech systems for unrestricted text areforced to rely on crude syntactic analyses and word clas-sifications in making judgements about he accentabilityof words in an utterance, often using the strategy of pre-vious mention whereby a word is de-accented if it (orperhaps its root) has previously occurred in some re-stricted segment of the text (cf.
\[10\], \[15\]).
The text canbe divided into such meaningful discourse segments onthe basis of cue phrases and paragraph boundaries.Meaning-to-speech systems, on the other hand, havebeen employed in applications with limited, well-defineddomains where semantic and discourse level knowledgeis available.
For these systems, the effectiveness of theprevious mention strategy can be improved by consid-ering semantic givenness in addition to lexical givennesswhen deciding if a word should be de-accented.Such enhanced previous-mention heuristics, while prov-ing quite effective in practice, have exhibited several defi-ciencies that have been noted by their proponents.
Fore-most among these is the inability of such strategies tomodel the seemingly contrastive nature of many accen-tual patterns in spoken language (\[10\]).
In some cases,contrastive stress errors may sound unnatural and in theworst case may actually mislead the hearer.
Anotherproblem that has been attributed to previous-mentionstrategies i the tendency to include too many accents(\[15\]), potentially resulting in an inability for the hearerto determine the most important aspects of the speaker'sintended message.
The remainder of this section ad-dresses these two problems and proposes explicitly mod-eling contrast in meaning-to-speech systems as a poten-tial solution.A previous-mention strategy might work as follows:193?
Assign accents to open-class items (e.g.
nouns,verbs, other content words)?
Do not assign accents to closed-class items (e.g.function words)?
De-accent any words that were already mentionedin the local discourse segment.Now consider a hypothetical pplication in a medical do-main that produces the type of output shown in (1) whena physician fails to include a recommended procedure ina plan for treating a specific patient.
1(1) a.
You seem to have neglected to consider a WHO-RACOSTOMY procedure for this patient.b.
I propose doing a LEFT thoracostomy.Using a previous-mention algorithm like the one abovewill produce the appropriate accentual pattern on theNP a left thoracostomy in (1)b because thoracoslomy isexplicit\]y mentioned in the previous entence.Now suppose the physician inadvertently includes thewrong procedure in the treatment plan, say a left ~hora-cotomy rather than the intended left thoracostomy.
Ex-ample (2) shows the possible output from the system.
(2) a.
You seem to have confused the THORACOTOMYand THORACOSTOMY procedures in your planfor this patient.b.
I propose doing a'left THORACOSTOMY.b ~.
I propose doing a LEFT THORACOSTOMY.b ' .
I propose doing a LEFT thoracostomy.b ~".
I propose doing a left thoracostomy.The four accentual possibilities for the NP a left ?ho-racos?omy in the second sentence are given in (2)b-b m.Examples (2)b and b ~ are both acceptable because theycorrectly accent the contrastive thoracostomy.
Basedon the the contents of the first sentence, however, theprevious-mention strategy would produce the accentualpattern illustrated in (2)b", which is clearly inappropri-ate.
In fact, such an intonation may cause the hearerto infer that the program's objection was to perform-ing the procedure on the wrong side.
Finally, if oneconsiders the terms left and thoracos?omy to be given1 The  examples  used throughout  he paper  are based on a thedomain  of TraurnAID,  which is current ly  under  development  atthe Univers i ty of Pennsy lvan ia  (\[25\]).
The  morb id  nature  of theexamples,  for which we apologize, is due entirely to the specialnature  of the  t rauma domain .
The  lay reader  may be interested toknow that  a thoracos?omy is the insert ion of a tube into the chest,and a thoracotomy is a surgical  incision of the chest wall.
In theexamples,  accented words are shown in smal l  capitals.prior to the utterance because of their inclusion in thephysician's plan, the previous-mention strategy wouldattempt o de-accent both terms as in (2)b~% Since theNP clearly requires ome form of accentuation, alterna-tive strategies are necessary in such a case.
Other plausi-ble previous-mention strategies exhibit similar problemsfor equally simple examples.We believe that some of the problems associated with thepreviot/s-mention strategy in meaning-to-speech systemscan be rectified by explicitly modeling contrastive stress.For the esample above, the program initially knows thatthe physician's plan includes a left thoracotomy and thatthe program's plan includes a left thoracostomy.
Hence,the program can construct an explicit set of alternativeprocedures from which accentual patterns can be deter-mined.
By noting that the alternatives differ not in theside on which they are to be performed, but in the ac-tual type of procedure, the program can easily decide tostress thoracostomy rather than left.
The precise algo-rithm for contrastive stress assignment is given a moredetailed explanation in \[18\].We shall also see how the contrastive stress approachcan avoid the over-accentuation problem of the previous-mention strategy as well.
Consider a patient with twochest wounds: a right lateral wound and a right anteriorwound.
At some point our hypothetical system may needto address one of these wounds in the following manner.
2(3) You need to address the right lateral chest woundin your treatment plan.Using the previous-mention strategy would lead to thefollowing output if the wound had not been mentionedpreviously.
(4) You need to address the RIGHT LATERAL CHESTWOUND in your treatment plan.The contrastive stress algorithm is able to recognize thecrucial distinction between the lateral and anterior prop-erties of the patient's two wounds and assign stress ac-cordingly, producing:(5) You need to address the right LATERAL chestwound in your treatment plan.3.
The Implementat ionThe present paper describes an implemented system(IBIS) that applies the CCG theory of prosody outlined2 A closely related issue is how the sys tem decides which modi -tiers are necessary in the descr ipt ion (\[20\]).194Prosodically Annotated Question~Intonat iona l  Parser~-----lDiseourse Mode~~ IC?ntent Generat?

Our examples below aretaker/from this domain, in which it is eventually our in-tention to deploy the generation system in a surgical sit-uation in a critiquing mode, as an output device for theexpert system.
For the present purpose of illustratingthe workings of the generation system, we have chosena simpler (but sociologically rather unrealistic) databasequery application.The architecture ofthe system (shown in Figure 1) iden-tifies the key modules of the system, their relationshipsto the database and the underlying rammar, and thedependencies among their inputs and outputs.
The pro-cess begins with a fully segmented and prosodically an-notated representation f a spoken query, as shown inexample (6).

The intona-tion contour is indicated more formally using a version ofPierrehumbert's notation (\[2\]).
In this notation, L+H*and H* are different high pitch accents.
LH% (and itsrelative LH$) and L (and its relatives LL% and LL$) arerising and low boundaries respectively.
The differencebetween members of sets like L, LL% and LL$ bound-aries embodies Pierrehumbert and Beckman's (\[2\]) dis-tinction between intermediate phrase boundaries, into-national phrase boundaries, and utterance boundaries.3We stress that we do not start with a speech wave, but a rep-resentation that one might obtain from a hypothetical system thattranslates uch a wave into strings of words with Pierrehumbert-style intonation markings.Since utterance boundaries always coincide with an in-tonational phrase boundary, this distinction is often leftimplicit in the literature, both being written with %boundaries.
For purposes of synthesis, however, the dis-tinction is important since utterance boundaries mustbe accompanied by a greater degree of lengthening andpausing.The intonational tunes L+H* LH(%/$) and H* L(L%/$)shown in example (6) convey two distinct kinds of dis-course information.
First, both H* and L+H* pitch ac-cents mark the word that they occur on (or rather, someelement of its interpretation) for focus ,  which in this taskimplies contrast of some kind.
Second, the tunes as awhole mark the constituent that bears them (or rather,its interpretation) ashaving a particular function in thediscourse.
We have argued at length elsewhere that, atleast in this restricted class of dialogues, the function ofthe L+H* LH% and L+H* LH$ tunes is to mark thetheme - that is, "what the participants have agreed totalk about".
The H* L(L%/$) tune marks the theme -that is, "what the speaker has to say" about the theme.We employ asimple bottom-up shift-reduce parser, mak-ir/g direct use of the combinatory prosody theory de-scribed in \[22, 17, 18\], to identify the semantics of thequestion.
The inclusion of prosodic categories in thegrammar allows the parser to identify the informationstructure within the question as well, dividing it intotheme and theme, and marking focused items with *as shown in (7).
For the moment, unmarked themesare handled by taking the longest unmarked constituentpermitted by the syntax.

The overall semantic struc-ture of the response can be determined by instantiatingthe variable in the lambda expression corresponding tothe wh-question with a simple Prolog query.
Given thesyntactic and focus-marked semantic representation forthe response, along with the syntactic and focus-markedsemantic representation forthe theme of the response, arepresentation forthe rheme of the response can worked195out from the grammar rules.
The assignment offocus forthe rheme of the response (i.e.
the instantiated variable)must be worked out from scratch, using techniques forassigning contrastive stress.The algorithm for assigning contrastive stress works asfollows.
For a given object x in the theme of the re-sponse, we associate a set of properties which are essen-tial for constructing an expression that uniquely refersto x, as well as a set of objects (and their referring prop-erties) 'which might be considered alternatives to z withrespect o the database under consideration.
The set ofalternal;ives i  initially restricted by properties or objectsexplicitly mentioned in the theme of the question.
Foreach property of x in turn, we restrict the set of alter-natives to include only those objects having the givenproperty.
When imposing the restriction decreases thenumber of alternatives, we conclude that the given prop-erty serves to distinguish x from its alternatives, uggest-ing that the corresponding linguistic material should bestressed.For example, for the question given in (6), the contentgenerator produces the following representation, becausethe theme is "What urinalysis addresses", the rheme is"hematuria", and the context includes alternative con-ditions and treatments:(8) Proposition:Theme:Rheme:s : addre88(*ur ina lys i s ,  *hernatur ia )8 : address (*ur ina lys i s ,x ) /np  : xnp : *hernatur iaFrom the output of the content generator, the ccGgeneration module produces a string of words andPierrehumbert-stylemarkings representing the response,as shown in (9).

Resul tsThe IBIS system produces distinct intonational differ-ences in minimal pairs of queries like those in examples(10)-(13) below.
These minimal pairs illustrate the sys-tem's capability for producing appropriately different in-tonation contours for a single string of words under thecontrol of discourse context.
If the responses in these4 Full descriptions of the CCG generation algorithm are givenin \[17\].examples are interchanged, the results sound distinctlyunnatural in the given contexts.

Although the pitch accent lo-cations in the responses in these examples are identical,occurring on lacerations and bleeding, the alternation inthe theme and theme tunes is necessary to convey the in-tended propositions in the given contexts.
Examples (12)and (13) show that the system makes appropriate dis-tinctions in focus placement within themes and themesbased on context.
More complex examples, like thoseshown in (14)-(16), illustrate the usefulness of the con-trastive stress algorithm for assigning pitch accents inappropriate locations.

Conclus ionsWhile previous attempts at intonation generation haverelied on previous-mention heuristics for assigning ac-cents, the present results show that is is possible to gen-erate synthesized spoken responses with appropriate in-tonational contours in a database query task using ex-plicit representations of contrastive stress.
Many im-portant problems remain, both because of the limitedrange of discourse-types and intonational tunes consid-ered here, and because of the extreme oversimplificationof the discourse model (particularly with respect o the5Further examples of the output of IBIS can be found in \[19\].196(14) Q: I know which procedure is recommended for the BURN patient,but which procedure is recommended for the WOUND patient?L+H* LH% H* LL$A: A left THORACOTOMY is recommended for the WOUND patient.H* L L+H* LH$(15) Q: I know which procedure is recommended for the BURN patient,but which patient is a left THORACOTOMY recommended for?L+H* LH% H* LL$A: A left THORACOTOMY is recommended for the WOUND patient.L+H* LH% It* LL$(16) Q: A RIGHT thoracotomy is recommended for the FIRST patient,but which thoracotomy is recommended for the SECOND patient?L+H* LH% H* LL$A: A LEFT thoracotomy is recommended for the SECOND patient.H* L L+H* LH$ontology, or variety of types of discourse ntities).
Nev-ertheless, the system presented here has a number ofproperties that we believe augur well for its extension toricher varieties of discourse, including the types of mono-logues and commentaries that are more appropriate forthe actual TraumAID domain.
Foremost among these isthe fact that the system and the underlying theory areentirely modular.
That is, any of its components can bereplaced without affecting any other component becauseeach is entirely independent of the particular grammardefined by the lexicon and the particular knowledge basethat the discourse concerns.
It is only because CCG al-lows us to unify the structures implicated in syntax andsemantics on the one hand, and intonation and discourseinformation on the other, that this modular structurecan be so simply attained.Re ferences1.
