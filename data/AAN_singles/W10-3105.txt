Proceedings of the Workshop on Negation and Speculation in Natural Language Processing, pages 28?31,Uppsala, July 2010.Speculation and negation annotation in natural language texts: what thecase of BioScope might (not) revealVeronika VinczeUniversity of SzegedSzeged, Hungaryvinczev@inf.u-szeged.hu1 IntroductionIn information extraction, it is of key impor-tance to distinguish between facts and uncertainor negated information.
In other words, IE appli-cations have to treat sentences / clauses containinguncertain or negated information differently fromfactual information that is why the development ofhedge and negation detection systems has receivedmuch interest ?
e.g.
the objective of the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task was also to develop hedge de-tection systems (Farkas et al, 2010).
For the train-ing and evaluation of such systems, corpora anno-tated for negation and speculation are necessary.There are several linguistic phenomena that canbe grouped under the term uncertainty.
Besideshedge and speculation, doubtful events are alsoconsidered as a subtype of uncertainty (Kim et al,2008) and Ganter and Strube (2009) argue that thenotion of weasel words are similar to hedges.
Aword is considered to be a weasel word if it createsan impression that something important has beensaid, but what is really communicated is vague,misleading, evasive or ambiguous, thus, it is alsorelated to uncertainty.
All these phenomena mightbe of interest for IE applications, which yields thatthe creation of corpora with uncertainty annotationis indispensable.2 Related workThere exist some corpora that contain annota-tion for speculation and/or negation.
The GE-NIA Event corpus (Kim et al, 2008) annotatesbiological events with negation and two types ofuncertainty.
In the BioInfer corpus (Pyysalo etal., 2007) biological relations are annotated fornegation.
The system developed by Medlock andBriscoe (2007) made use of a corpus consistingof six papers from genomics literature in whichsentences were annotated for speculation.
Set-tles et al (2008) constructed a corpus where sen-tences are classified as either speculative or defi-nite, however, no keywords are marked in the cor-pus and Shatkay et al (2008) describe a databasewhere sentences are annotated for certainty amongother features.
As a corpus specifically annotatedfor weasel words, WikiWeasel should be men-tioned, which was constructed for the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task (Farkas et al, 2010) and con-tains Wikipedia paragraphs annotated for weaselwords.3 The BioScope corpusThe BioScope corpus (Vincze et al, 2008) is ?
toour best knowledge ?
the largest corpus availablethat is annotated for both negation and hedge key-words and the only one that contains annotationfor linguistic scopes.
It includes three types oftexts from the biomedical domain ?
namely, radio-logical reports, biological full papers and abstractsfrom the GENIA corpus.
(15 new full biomedi-cal papers were annotated for hedge cues and theirscopes, which served as the evaluation databaseof the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task (Farkas et al,2010), and this dataset will be added to BioScopein the near future.)
The annotation was carried outby two students of linguistics supervised by a lin-guist.
Problematic cases were continuously dis-cussed among the annotators and dissimilar anno-tations were later resolved by the linguist.3.1 Annotation principlesIn BioScope, speculation is understood as the pos-sible existence of a thing is claimed ?
neither itsexistence nor its non-existence is known for sure.Only one level of uncertainty is marked (as op-posed to the GENIA corpus (Kim et al, 2008) orShatkay et al (2008)) and no weasels are anno-tated.
Negation is seen as the implication of non-existence of something.The annotation was based on four basic princi-ples:28?
Each keyword has a scope.?
The scope must include its keyword.?
Min-max strategy:?
The minimal unit expressinghedge/negation is marked as keyword.?
The scope is extended to the maximalsyntactic unit.?
No intersecting scopes are allowed.These principles were determined at the verybeginning of the annotation process and they werestrictly followed throughout the corpus building.3.2 Problematic casesHowever, in some cases, some language phenom-ena seemed to contradict the above principles.These issues required a thorough consideration ofthe possible solutions in accordance with the basicprinciples in order to keep the annotation of thecorpus as consistent as possible.
The most notableexamples include the following:?
Negative keywords without scope:[Negative] chest radiograph.In this case, the scope contains only the key-word.?
Elliptic sentencesMoreover, ANG II stimulated NF-kappaB activation in human mono-cytes, but [not] in lymphocytesfrom the same preparation.With the present encoding scheme of scopes,there is no way to signal that the negationshould be extended to the verb and the objectas well.?
Nested scopesOne scope includes another one:These observations (suggest thatTNF and PMA do (not lead to NF-kappa B activation through induc-tion of changes in the cell redoxstatus)).The semantic interpretation of such nestedscopes should be understood as ?it is possi-ble that there is no such an event that.
.
.
?.?
Elements in between keyword and targetwordAlthough however is not affected by thehedge cue in the following example, it is in-cluded in the scope since consecutive textspans are annotated as scopes:(Atelectasis in the right mid zoneis, however, <possible>).?
Complex keywordsSometimes a hedge / negation is expressedvia a phrase rather than a single word: theseare marked as complex keywords.?
Inclusion of modifiers and adjunctsIt is often hard to decide whether a modifieror adjunct belongs to the scope or not.
In or-der not to lose potentially important informa-tion, the widest scope possible is marked ineach case.?
Intersecting scopesWhen two keywords occur within one sen-tence, their scopes might intersect, yieldingone apparently empty scope (i.e.
scope with-out keyword) and a scope with two keywords:(Repression did ([not] <seem> toinvolve another factor whose activ-ity is affected by the NSAIDs)).In such cases, one of the scopes (usually thenegative one) was extended:((Repression did [not] <seem> toinvolve another factor whose activ-ity is affected by the NSAIDs)).On the other hand, there were some cases wherethe difficulty of annotation could be traced back tolexical issues.
Some of the keyword candidateshave several senses (e.g.
if ) or can be used in dif-ferent grammatical structures (e.g.
indicate vs. in-dicate that) and not all of them are to be markedas a keyword in the corpus.
Thus, senses / usagesto be annotated and those not to be annotated hadto be determined precisely.Finally, sometimes an apparently negative key-word formed part of a complex hedge keyword(e.g.
cannot be excluded), which refers to thefact that speculation can be expressed also by anegated word, thus, the presence of a negativeword does not automatically entail that the sen-tence is negated.294 Outlook: Comparison with othercorporaBesides BioScope, the GENIA Event corpus (Kimet al, 2008) also contains annotation for negationand speculation.
In order to see what the main dif-ferences are between the corpora, the annotationprinciples were contrasted:?
in GENIA Event, no modifier keywords aremarked, however, in BioScope, they are;?
the scope of speculation and negation is ex-plicitly marked in BioScope and it can beextended to various constituents within theclause / sentence though in GENIA Event, itis the event itself that is within the scope;?
two subtypes of uncertainty are distinguishedin GENIA Event: doubtful and probable,however, in BioScope there is one umbrellaterm for them (speculation).An essential difference in annotation principlesbetween the two corpora is that GENIA Event fol-lows the principles of event-centered annotationwhile BioScope annotation does not put specialemphasis on events.
Event-centered annotationmeans that annotators are required to identify asmany events as possible within the sentence thenlabel each separately for negation / speculation.The multiplicity of events in GENIA and themaximum scope principle exploited in BioScope(see 3.1) taken together often yields that a GENIAevent falls within the scope of a BioScope key-word, however, it should not be seen as a specu-lated or negated event on its own.
Here we providean illustrative example:In summary, our data suggest thatchanges in the composition of tran-scription factor AP-1 is a key molecu-lar mechanism for increasing IL-2 tran-scription and may underlie the phe-nomenon of costimulation by EC.According to the BioScope analysis of the sen-tence, the scope of suggest extends to the end ofthe sentence.
It entails that in GENIA it is onlythe events is a key molecular mechanism and un-derlie the phenomenon that are marked as proba-ble, nevertheless, the events changes, increasing,transcription and costimulation are also includedin the BioScope speculative scope.
Thus, withinthis sentence, there are six GENIA events out ofwhich two are labeled as probable, however, inBioScope, all six are within a speculative scope.In some cases, there is a difference in betweenwhat is seen as speculative / negated in the cor-pora.
For instance, negated ?investigation?
verbsin Present Perfect are seen as doubtful events inGENIA and as negative events in BioScope:However, a role for NF-kappaB in hu-man CD34(+) bone marrow cells has notbeen described.According to GENIA annotation principles, therole has not been described, therefore it is doubt-ful what the role exactly is.
However, in BioScope,the interpretation of the sentence is that there hasnot been such an event that the role for NF-kappaBin human CD34(+) bone marrow cells has been de-scribed.
Thus, it is marked as negative.Another difference between the annotationschemes of BioScope and GENIA is that instancesof weaseling are annotated as probable events inGENIA, however, in BioScope they are not.
Anexample for a weasel sentence is shown below:Receptors for leukocyte chemoattrac-tants, including chemokines, are tradi-tionally considered to be responsible forthe activation of special leukocyte func-tions such as chemotaxis, degranulation,and the release of superoxide anions.5 ConclusionsSome interesting conclusions can be drawn fromthe difficulties encountered during annotation pro-cess of the BioScope corpus.
As for method-ology, it is unquestionable that precisely definedrules (on scope marking, keyword marking and onthe interpretation of speculation / negation) are es-sential for consistent annotation, thus, pre-definedguidelines can help annotation work a lot.
How-ever, difficulties or ambiguities not seen previ-ously may emerge (and they really do) only dur-ing the process of annotation.
In this way, a con-tinuous reformulation and extension of annotationrules is required based on the corpus data.
On theother hand, problematic issues sometimes mightbe solved in several different ways.
When decid-ing on their final treatment, an ideal balance be-tween gain and loss should be reached, in otherwords, the min-max strategy as a basic annotation30principle can also be applied here (minimize theloss and maximize the gain that the solution canprovide).AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported in part by the NationalOffice for Research and Technology (NKTH,http://www.nkth.gov.hu/) of the Hun-garian government within the framework of theproject MASZEKER.ReferencesRich?ard Farkas, Veronika Vincze, Gy?orgy M?ora, J?anosCsirik, and Gy?orgy Szarvas.
