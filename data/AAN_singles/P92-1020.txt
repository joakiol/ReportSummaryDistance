WOULD I L IE TO YOU?MODELL ING MISREPRESENTATION AND CONTEXT IN D IALOGUECarl GutwinAlberta Research Council 16815 8th Street N. E.Calgary, Alberta T2E 7H7, CanadaInternet: gutwin@ skyler.arc.ab.caGordon McCallaARIES Laboratory, University of Saskatchewan 2Saskatoon, Saskatchewan S7N 0W0, CanadaABSTRACTIn this paper we discuss a mechanism formodifying context in a tutorial dialogue.
The contextmechanism imposes a pedagogically motivatedmisrepresentation (PMM) on a dialogue to achieveinstructional goals.
In the paper, we outline severaltypes of PMMs and detail a particular PMM in asample dialogue situation.
While the notion ofPMMs are specifically oriented towards tutorialdialogue, misrepresentat ion has interestingimplications for context in dialogue situationsgenerally, and also suggests that Grice's maxim ofquality needs to be modified.1.
INTRODUCTIONMost of the time, truth is a wonderful thing.However, this research studies situations where notsaying what you believe to be the truth can be thebest course of action.
Intentional misrepresentationof a speaker's knowledge appears to be a common andhighly pragmatic process used in many different kindsof dialogue, especially tutorial dialogue.We use imperfect or incomplete representations iresponse to constraints and demands imposed by thesituation: for example, many models of the realworld are extremely complex, and misrepresentationsare often used as useful, comprehensibleapproximations of complicated systems.
People useidealized Newtonian mechanics, the wave (or particle)theory of light, and rules of default reasoning statingthat birds fly, penguins are birds, and penguins don'tfly.
Some systems which cannot be simplified arepurposefully ignored: for example, higher order.

Simplified andimperfect representations are often found in tutoringdiscourse.Misrepresentation as a pedagogic strategy holdspromise for extending the capabilities of intelligenttutoring systems (ITSs), but the concept also affectscomputational dialogue research: it builds on theidea of discourse focus and context, extends work onadapting to the user with multiple representations ofknowledge, and challenges Grice's maxims ofconversation.2.
MOTIVAT ION AND BACKGROUNDMisrepresentations are alterations to a perceivedreality.
When they have sincere pedagogic purposes,we name them Pedagogically MotivatedMisrepresentations, or PMMs.
PMMs can reduce thecomplexity of the dialogue and of the concepts to belearned, provide focus in a busy environment, orfacilitate the communication fessential knowledge.PMMs share themes with research intocomputational dialogue and ITS.
PMMs areintimately connected to ideas of instructional anddialogue focus, the latter of which was explored byGrosz \[1977\], who stated that task-oriented dialoguecould be organized into focus spaces, each containinga subset of the dialogue's purposes and entities.
Thecollection of focus spaces created by the changingdynamics of a dialogue could be gathered together intoa focusing structure which assisted in interpreting newutterances.Adaptation to the hearer is also a concern indialogue research: beliefs about he hearer or about hesituation can be used to vary the structure,complexity, and language of discourse to optimallysuit the hearer.
Several projects (e.g.
\[McKeown et al1985\], \[Moore & Swartout 1989\], \[Paris 1989\]) have152looked at adapting the level or tenor of explanationsto a user's needs.
Paris's \[1989\] TAILOR systemvaries its output (descriptions of complex devices)depending upon the hearer's expertise.Another concern in both dialogue research and ITSresearch is multiple representations of domainknowledge.
TAILOR, for example, uses two differentmodels of each device to construct i s explanations.Tutoring systems like SMITHTOWN \[Shute andBonar 1986\] and MHO \[Lesgold et al 1987\] organizedifferent representations around distinct pedagogicgoals; in the domain of electrical circuits, QUEST\[Frederiksen & White 1988\] provides progressivelymore sophisticated representations, from a simplequalitative model to quantitative circuit heory.Lastly, any discussion of misrepresentation ndialogue is bound to reflect on Grice's first maxim ofquality, "do not say that which you believe to befalse."
The conversational maxims of H. Paul Grice\[1977\] are a well-known set of observations abouthuman discourse frequently used in computationaldialogue research (for example \[Joshi et al1984\],\[Moore and Paris 1989\], \[Reichman 1985\]).However, people sometimes accept the truth ofGrice's maxims too easily.
A close examinationreveals difficulties with a literal interpretation of thefirst maxim of quality.
While this maxim seems areasonable rule to use in dialogue, examination ofhuman discourse shows many instances whereuttering falsehoods is legitimate behaviour.
Forexample, in some first year computer science courses,students are told that a semicolon is the terminator ofa Pascal statement.
This utterance misrepresentsreality (a semicolon actually separates statements),but the underlying purpose is sincere: themisrepresentation allows students to beginprogramming without forcing them to learn aboutsyntax charts, parsing algorithms, or recursivedefinitions.
Grice's maxims have avoided majorcriticism by the computational dialogue community,and the maxims have been successfully used inlimited domains to help dialogue systems interactwith their users.
Realizing that misrepresentationsoften occur in tutorial discourse, however, provides uswith a context for investigating limits to the Griceanapproach.3.
OVERVIEW OF PEDAGOGICALLYMOTIVATED MISREPRESENTATIONSWe have identified and characterized several typesof PMM that can occur in tutorial discourse.
Wedefine each type as a computational structure that,when invoked, alters the dialogue system's ownreality and hence the student's perception of reality,for sincere pedagogic purposes.
There are fiveessential computational characteristics governing theuse of PMMs: preconditions, applicabilityconditions, removal conditions, revelation conditions,and effects.These conditions are predicates matched againstinformation in the dialogue system's essential datastructures: a domain knowledge representation (ithis system, a granularity hierarchy after \[Greet andMcCalla 1989\], as shown in Figure 1); a model of thestudent; and an instructional p an (in this system, asimplified version of Brecht's (1990) content planner,from which a sample partial plan is shown in Figure2).
Each step in the instructional plan provides ateaching operator (such as prepare-to-teach) and aconcept from the knowledge base which becomes thefocus of the instructional interaction.I Major Programming Concept IFigure 1.
A fragment of the domain representationIn this implementation, PMMs act bymanipulating the dialogue system's blackboard-basedinternal communication.
An active PMM interceptsrelevant messages before the knowledge base canreceive them, then returns misrepresented informationinstead of the "true" information tothe blackboard.153'UT ~' (conditional"-~ COI~" STUDL~IT 1 ~ '~ ~STUDEI~ r"KNOWS KI~WS '(conol)hal ~?~nditionalexpres ~xpress ions)  ,Figure 2.
A partial content plan from Brecht's \[1990\]planner.The first step in using a misrepresentationinvolves the PMM's preconditions and applicabilityconditions.
Preconditions are definitional constraintscharacterizing situations in which a particular PMMis conceivable.
Applicability conditions actuallydetermine the suitability of a PMM to a situation.Each applicability condition examines one element ofthe current instructional context, from the studentmodel, the domain representation, r the instructionalplan.
The individual conditions are combined todetermine a final "score" for the PMM, using acalculus akin to MYCIN's certainty factors(\[Shortliffe 1976\]).
For example, one applicabilitycondition states that less student knowledge about adomain concept can provide vidence for the PMM'sgreater applicability, and more knowledge implies lessapplicability.A PMM's removal conditions provide afacility fordetermining when the misrepresentation is o longeruseful and may be removed.
However, a dialoguesystem also needs to know when a PMM is notworking well; after all, there are certain dangersassociated with the use of misrepresentations.
Forexample, a student may realize the discrepancybetween the altered environment and reality.
Thesesituations are monitored by a PMM's revelationconditions, guiding the system in cases where it mustbe ready to abandon the misrepresentation and revealthe misrepresentation.If preconditions and applicability conditions aresatisfied, aPMM's procedural effects can be applied tothe domain representation, implementing the'alternative r ality' presented to the student throughthe dialogue.The way in which the student's perceivedenvironment is altered and restored plays a crucial partin a misrepresentation's success.
The dialogue actionswhich accomplish these changes compose two uniquesubdialogues.
An alteration subdialogue must make asmooth transition to the altered environment; arestoration subdialogue has the opposite ffect: itmust restore the "real" environment, knot all theloose ends created by the misrepresentation, a d helpthe student transfer knowledge from themisrepresented environment tothe real environment.Restoration subdialogues must guard against anotherpotential danger of misrepresentation: that studentsmay retain incorrect information even after themisrepresentation has been retracted at the close of thelearning episode.4.
DETAILS OF THE PMM MODELWe have identified several types of pedagogicmisrepresentations, and have implemented andevaluated them in a partial tutorial dialogue system.The implemented system concentrates onthe functionof the misrepresentation expert, and therefore thedialogue system is not fully functional: for example,it does not process or generate surface naturallanguage.
We have implemented themisrepresentation expert and the PMM structures, theblackboard communication architecture, the studentmodel, and the domain knowledge (see Figure 1).
Thecontent planner and other system components areimplemented as shells able to provide necessaryinformation when needed.Input to the system is a teaching situationincluding information from the content planner, thestudent model, and the domain.
The system's outputis a log of system actions detailing the simulation ofthe teaching situation.Figure 3 shows the organization of theimplemented PMMs, some of which inherit sharedconditions and effects.
The implemented PMMs havea variety of uses: Ignore-Specializations PMMsimplifies concepts by reducing the number of kindsthat a concept has; Compress-Redirect PMMcollapses a part of the granularity hierarchy to allowspecific instantiations ofgeneral concepts.
There arealso extended versions of these two PMMs whichhave more wide-reaching effects.
The remainingPMMs are Entrapment PMM, which uses amisconception to corner a student and add weight o154the illustration of a better conception, and Simplify-Explanation PMM, which reduces the complexity of aconcept's functional explanation.
The remainingrestriction PMM, Restrict-Peripheral PMM, isdetailed in the following section to illustrate theconcept of misrepresentation and the elements of thePMM model, and to show the PMM's use in anactual dialogue.Compress-,- I \ I E o o'PMM\[ Local PMM J~ I ,t"?n,ca.e.P~, s, I Ignore-- - ~ \[ LOCal t'MM \] SpecializationsExtended PMMI C?mpress- I Redirect LoCal, PMMFigure 3.
The PMM hierarchy.The purpose of the "Restrict Peripheral Concepts"PMM is to simplify concepts related to the currentteaching concept.
For example, during an initialdiscussion of base cases (while learning programmingin Lisp), a student might benefit  from amisrepresentation which restricts recursive cases to asingle type, the variety of recursive case used with cdrrecursion.
The restriction allows both participants inthe dialogue to discuss and refer to a single commonobject, and allows the student o concentrate on basecases without needing to know the complexities ofrecursive cases.This PMM's preconditions check that there areperipheral concepts in the current instructionalcontext.
Applicability conditions determine whetherthose concepts hould be simplified, by consideringthe domain's pedagogic omplexity and the student'scapabilities.
For example, the PMM considers thedifficulty ratings of the current concept and theperipheral concept, the student's knowledge of theseconcepts and any existing difficulties with them asshown in the student model.
In addition, the PMMconsiders other factors such as the student's anxietylevel and their ability with structural relationships.Removal conditions for this PMM consider factorssuch as whether or not instruction about the currentconcept has been completed, or whether theinstructional context has changed so markedly that thePMM can no longer be useful.
Revelation conditionscover two other cases for a PMM's removal: whenthe student challenges the misrepresentation, andwhen the student or another part of the dialoguesystem requires ahidden part of the domain.If applied, the effect of this PMM is to restrictperipheral concepts related to the current concept suchthat all but one of their specializations are hidden.The PMM carries out the restriction, but does notchoose the specializations that will remain visible:that decision is left to the pedagogic expert, using theinstructional p an and the student model.5.
EXAMPLE DIALOGUEPMM "Restrict Peripheral Concepts" is illustratedbelow in an example dialogue.
The dialogue is basedon an actual trial of the implemented system, whichdetermined when to invoke the PMM, when to revokeit, and all the interactions between the knowledge baseand the dialogue system.
However, the surfaceutterances are fabricated to illustrate how themisrepresentation system would function in acompleted tutorial discourse system.The teaching domain in the dialogue is recursionin Lisp (as shown in Figure 1), and the systembelieves the student to be a novice Lisp programmer.T: ... the next thing I'd like to show you is the partof recursion that stops the reduction.The system's current instructional context contains ateaching operator, "prepare to teach x," and a currentconcept, "base case."
The current situation satisfiesthe preconditions of PMM "Restrict PeripheralConcepts," and its applicability score ranks it as mostapplicable to the situation.
The PMM thusdetermines that the peripheral concept "recursive case"will be restricted to one specialization, and thepedagogic expert chooses 'cdr recursive case' as themost appropriate specialization for novice students.The system asks the instructional planner toreplan given the altered view of the domain, and entersinto an alteration subdialogue with the student.Although these subdialogues are only represented asstubs in the system's internal notation, the discoursecould proceed as follows:T: Do you remember the last example you saw?S: Yes.155T: OK.
Remember that I pointed out the parts of therecursive function, the base case and the recursivecase?S: Yup.T: Great.
Now, I'll just put that example back on fora second.
You'll notice that the recursive case lookslike "(t (allnums (cdr liszt)))" Got that?S: Yup.T: Ok. For when we look at the base case, I wantyou to assume that this recursive case is the only kindof recursive case that there is.
Then when we writesome programs, you won't have to worry about therecursive case part.
Does that sound ok?\[At this point the system has already imposed itsalteration on the knowledge base, and when thesystem asks for the specializations of 'recursive case,'it will receive only 'cdr recursive case' as an answer.\]S: Sure.T: Great.
So the thing to remember is, wheneveryou need a recursive case, use a recursive case likeyou have in the example.So.
Let's move on to looking at the way the basecase works; let's start with that example we had up.First, you identify the base case...Later in the dialogue, the student is constructing asolution to another problem:S: I'm not sure about the base case for this one ... Ithink I'll do the recursive case first.
What does therecursive case do again?T: A recursive case reduces the problem by callingthe function again with reduced input.
The recursivecase is the default case of the "cond" statement, and itcalls the function again with the cdr of the list input.\[Here the PMM again alters perceived reality,restricting 'recursive case' to 'cdr recursive case'\]S: Right.lisz0))?T: Yep.So the recursive case is (t (findb (cdr\[The PMM is again used to verify the student'squery.\]S: OK. Now the base case ...This exchange shows that the misrepresentation isuseful in focusing the dialogue on the current conceptof base case, by making the recursive case easy tosynthesize.The system continues investigating and teachingbase case until the student can analyse and synthesizesimple base cases.
The instructional plan then raisesits next step, "complete base case."
Arrival at thisplan step satisfies one of the removal conditions forthe PMM, so the system engages in a restorationsubdialogue with the student, which might go asfollows, preparing the student for the next context:T: Ok.
The next thing we'll do is look a little closerat recursive case.
Although I told you that there wasonly one kind of recursive case, there are actuallymore.
The reason we only used one kind of recursivecase is because I wanted to make sure you learned theway a base case works without needing all the detailsof recursive cases.
Recursive cases still do the samething (that is, reducing the input) but the specificparts might do different things than the recursive casewe used.
Does that sound ok to you?S: ok.T: So let's look at recursive cases.
We'll only dealwith the kinds used with cdr recursion .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEvaluative trials for the PMM system have beenaimed specifically at both the individual PMMs andthe PMM model.
Twenty-six different types ofsituations have been designed to test the PMMs'relevance, consistence, and coherence.
Through thesetrials the individual PMMs demonstrated theirintegrity, and the PMM model itself was shown to becapable of working within a dialogue systemarchitecture.
Full details of evaluation methodologyand results can be found in \[Gutwin 1991\].This research project has shown that PMMs canbe represented for use in a tutorial dialogue system,and supports their value as a pedagogic tool.However, the foremost contribution of the PMMsystem to computational dialogue may be how itextends the notion of focus currently used in dialogueresearch.
Grosz and Sidner \[1986\] see dialogue as acollection of focus spaces which shift in reaction tochanges in the discourse's purposes and saliententities.
This research suggests that within any ofthese focus spaces, there can exist a further structure:a context hat provides a specific interpretation f theknowledge represented in the system.
The sameknowledge is "in focus" throughout the focus space,but different contexts can color or interpret hatknowledge in different ways.
A pedagogicallymotivated misrepresentation is thus a contextmechanism that alters the domain knowledge for aneducational purpose.
It is possible that we always use156some kind of alternate interpretation ormisrepresentation to mediate between our knowledgeand other dialogue participants.Focusing structure has traditionally been used ininterpretation: in several projects (\[Grosz 1977\],\[Sidner 1983\]), context structures are shown to beuseful in tasks like pronoun resolution or anaphoraresolution.
Pragmatic ontexts, uch as those createdby a PMM, can direct generation of discourse as well.They are active reflections of the larger situation,rather than local representations of dialogue structure,and they are able to alter the discourse in order tofurther some goal.
Responding to patterns in theworld outside the dialogue allows pragmatic contextmechanisms such as PMMs to consider fitness andsuitability of a dialogue situation in addition to afocus space's ubset of goals and salient entities.Another issue of importance to this research isthat of tailoring.
While some existing dialoguesystems tailor an explanation to the user's level ofexpertise (e.g.
\[Paris 1989\], \[McKeown et al1985\]),the PMM system instead tailors the domain to thelearner.
The PMM system does not make basicdecisions about either content or delivery in adialogue, but attempts to shape the content'srepresentation into a form which will be best suited tothe learning situation.The PMM model also touches on research intomultiple representation, in that it provides amechanism for encapsulating several differentinterpretations ofa knowledge base.
The mechanismmight be able to model and administer alternaterepresentations of other kinds as well, such asanalogy.The usefulness and ubiquity of PMMs alsosuggests that a literal interpretation of Grice'smaxims, particularly the maxim of quality, isinappropriate.
Clearly, we often say things we knowto be false!
However, the maxim of quality can berescued by indicating the relationship between truthand dialogue purposes: from the original, "do not saythat which you believe to be false," we create a newmaxim, "do not say that which you believe to be falseto your purposes."
The new maxim shifts emphasisfrom an absolute standard of truth in dialogue to themore pragmatic idea of truth relative to a dialogue'sgoals, and better eflects the way humans actually usediscourse.Much remains to be accomplished in this research.There are undoubtedly other as yet undiscoveredPMMs.
The notion of intentional misrepresentationitself may just be an instance of a more generalcontext mechanism that underlies all dialogue, an ideathat should be explored by considering other kinds ofdialogue from the perspective of PMMs, and by acloser examination of existing theories of discoursecontext.
Finally, all of the oracles used in the PMMSystem should be replaced by functioning componentsso that a dialogue system with complete capabilitiescan stand alone as proof of the PMM concept.Nevertheless, this research points the way towards thepossibility of a new and widely applicable mechanismfor modelling dialogue.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors wish to thank the Natural Science andEngineering Research Council of Canada for financialassistance during this research.REFERENCES\[Brecht 1990\] Brecht (Wasson), B.
