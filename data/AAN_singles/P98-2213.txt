co.j pAbst ractThis paper describes methods for relating (thread-ing) multiple newspaper articles, and for visualizingvarious characteristics of them by using a directedgraph.
A set of articles is represented by a set ofword vectors, and the similarity between the vec-tors is then calculated.
The graph is constructedfrom the similarity matrix.
By applying some con-straints on the chronological ordering of articles, anefficient hreading algorithm that runs in O(n) time(where n is the number of articles) is obtained.
Theconstructed graph is visualized with words that rep-resent he topics of the threads, and words that rep-resent new information in each article.
The thread-ing technique is suitable for Webcasting (push) ap-plications.
A threading server determines relation-ships among articles from various news sources, andcreates files containing their threading information.This information is represented in eXtended MarkupLanguage (XML), and can be visualized on mostWeb browsers.
The XML-based representation a da current prototype are described in this paper.1 In t roduct ionThe vast quantity of information available todaymakes it difficult to search for and understand theinformation that we want.
If there are many relateddocuments about a topic, it is important o capturetheir relationships o that we can obtain a cleareroverview.
However, most information resources, in-cluding newspaper articles do not have explicit re-lationships.
For example, although documents onthe Web are connected by hyperlinks, relationshipscannot be specified.Webcasting ("push") applications uch as Point-cast i constitute a promising solution to the prob-lem of information overloading, but the articles theyprovide do not have links, or else must be manuallylinked at a high cost in terms of time and effort.This paper describes methods for relating news-paper articles automatically, and its application fora Webcasting application.
A set of article on a par-I htt p://www.pointcast.comticular topic is ordered chronologically, and the re-sults are represented as a directed graph.
There arevarious ways of relating documents and visualizingtheir structure.
For example, USENET articles canbe accessed by means of newsreader software.
In thesystem, a label (title) is attached to each posted mes-sage, specifying whether it deals with a new topic oris a reply to a previous message.
A chain of articleson a topic is called a thread.
In this case, the rela-tionships between the articles are explicitly defined.This post/reply-based approach makes it possible fora reader to group all the messages on a particulartopic.
However, it is difficult to capture the story ofthe thread from its thread structure, since appropri-ate titles are not added to the messages.This paper aims to provide ways of relating mul-tiple news articles and representing their structurein a way that is easy to understand and computa-tionally inexpensive.
A set of relationships i  definedhere as a directed graph.
A node indicates an arti-cle, and an arc from node X to Y indicates that thearticle X is followed by Y (or that X is adjacent oY).
An article contains both known and unknown(new) information.
Known information consists ofwords shared by the beginning and ending points ofan arc.
When node X is adjacent o Y, the wordsare represented by (X fq Y).
The known informationis called genus words in this paper.
Even if an articlefollows another one, it generally contains ome newinformation.
This information can be representedby subtraction (Y -  X) (Damashek, 1995), and iscalled differentia words, by analogy with definitionsentences in dictionaries, which contain genus wordsand differentia.
In this paper, genus and differentiaewords are used to calculate the similarities betweentwo articles, and to visualize topics in a set of arti-cles.Since articles are ordered chronologically, thereare some time constraints on the connectivity ofnodes.
A graph is created by constructing an ad-jacency matrix for nodes, which in turn is createdfrom a similarity matrix for nodes.Some potential features of articles in a set can bedetermined by analyzing some formal aspects of the1307d2 d3od5 .od6Figure 1: Example of a Directed Graph Gcorresponding graph.
For example, the paths in thegraph show the stories of the nodes they contain.Multiple paths for a node (article) show that thereare multiple stories associated with it.
Furthermore,if the node has a long path, it is in the "main stream"of the topic represented by the graph.
An efficientalgorithm for finding such paths is described, laterin the paper.Application of the threading method to docu-ments on the Web would be very useful because, al-though such documents are connected by hyperlinks,their relationships cannot be specified.
In this paper,generated threads by this method are represented ineXtended Markup Language (XML) (XML, 1997),which is the proposed standard for exchange of in-formation on the Web.
XML-based threads can beused by webcasting or push services, since varioustools for parsing and visualizing threads are avail-able.In Section 2, a directed graph structure for arti-cles is defined, and the procedure for constructing adirected graph is described in Section 3.
In Section4, some features of the created graph are discussed.Section 5 introduces a webcasting application by us-ing the threading technique, and Section 6 concludesthe paper.2 Def in i t ion  of  a Graph St ructureA set of articles is represented as an ordered set V:V = {dx,d2, .
.
.
,d ,} .The suffix sequence 1, 2 , .
.
.
,  n represents the pas-sage of time.
Article di is older than di+l.
The orderis obtained from the publication dates of the articles.Different ime points arbitrarily are assigned to ar-ticles published on the same day.Related articles are represented as a directedgraph (V,A).
V is a set of nodes.
A is a set ofordered pairs (i, j), where i and j are members ofV.
Figure 1 shows an example of a directed graph.In this case, the graph is represented as follows:V = {dl,d2,d3,d4,ds,d6,d6,d7}, A = {(dl,d2),(d2, d3), (dl, d4), (d5, d6), (d2, dT), (d3, ds), (dT, ds)}The nodes are ordered chronologically.
The fol-lowing constraint is introduced into the graph:M =dld2d3d445d6d7dsdx d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 ds0 1 0 1 0 0 0 00 0 1 0 0 0 1 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 1 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Figure 3: Adjacency Matrix Mc of GConstraint 1For (di,dj) 6 A, i < jThe constraint simply shows that an old articlecannot follow a new one.3 Creat ing  a Graph St ructure  forArt i c lesThis section describes how to construct a directedgraph structure from a set of articles.
Any directedgraph can be represented by a matrix.
Figure 3shows the adjacency matrix MG of the graph G inFigure 1.For example, a value of "1" for the (1, 2) elementin M indicates that dx is adjacent o d2.
Since anarticle cannot follow itself, the value of (i, i) elementsis "0".
From the time constraint defined in Section3, MG is an upper triangle matrix.The following is a procedure for constructing adirected graph for related articles:1.
Calculate the similarity and difference betweenarticles.2.
Construct a similarity matrix.3.
Convert the matrix into an adjacency matrix.In the next section, each step is illustrated by us-ing the set of articles V in Figure 2 on the subjectof nuclear testing taken from the Nikkei Shinbun.
23.1 Calculating the similarities anddifferences between articlesThe function sim(di,dj) calculates the word-basedsimilarity between two articles.
It is defined on thebasis of Salton's Vector Space Model (Salton, 1968).Words are extracted from an article by using a mor-phological analyzer.
Next, nouns and verbs are ex-tracted as keywords._ di wdisim(di,dj) = ~-,k,,, wkw k~kWkw) k kw\]2The articles were originally written in Japanese.1308dl: The prime minister of France says that it is necessary to restart nuclear testing.d2: The Defense Minister suggests restarting nuclear testing.d3: At a summit conference, the Prime Minister will adopt a policy of requesting the French Government tohalt nuclear testing.d4: China's latest nuclear test will hold up negotiations on a treaty to abolish such testing.d5: The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Youhei Kohno, takes a critical attitude toward China, and asksFrance to understand Japan's position.d6: The prime minister of New Zealand asks the French Government not to restart nuclear testing.dT: President of France states that nuclear testing will restart in September, and that France will conducteight tests between ow and next May.d8: France states that it will restart nuclear testing.

In a conventional hierar-chical clustering algorithm, a similarity for any com-bination of two articles is required in order to con-struct a hierarchical tree of the set of articles.
Thiscauses ~ calculations of the similarity func-tion, for n articles, with a consequent complexityof O(n2).
This is very expensive when n is large.In our algorithm for constructing a similarity ma-trix, shown in Figure 4, the complexity of construct-ing a graph structure for an article set by using aconstraint is O(n).
The following constraint, whichprocedure  MakeDistanceMatrixfor i= 2 to n beg inif i - k< 1 thens+-  1 e l ses+- - i -kfo r j  =sto i - lbeg ina(i, j) +- sim(di,dj)j~ - j+ lendi+ - i+ lendFigure 4: Procedure for Constructing Similarity Ma-trixincludes Constraint 1, is used for in threading algo-rithm.Const ra in t  2For (di,dj) E A, j - (k + l) <i<jThis constraint means that an article can only fol-low the last k articles.
As the result, the number oftimes the similarity matrix needs to be calculated isreduced by kn, giving a complexity of O(n).By using the algorithm, each similarity betweennodes is calculated, and the similarity matrix in Fig-ure 5 shows a similarity matrix S of V. In this case,keywords are extracted from title sentences, and kis set to five.3.3 Convers ion  into an ad jacency  matr ixFrom the similarity matrix, an adjacency matrix isconstructed.
An element s(i, j) in the similarity ma-trix corresponds to the element ss(i , j )  in the adja-cency matrix SS.
There are various strategies for theconversion.
In this paper, ss(i , j )  is set to 1 whens(i, j) > 0.18, and any node can follow at most k/2nodes, in this case two nodes.
Figure 6 shows a re-sult of the conversion.
Finally, a directed graph forV is created (Figure 7).
Figure 8 shows a graph thatvisualizes the content of the articles in our example.1309S =dld2d3d4dsd~d7d8d9dlodl d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 ds d9 dio0 .309 .239 .072 .131 .319 0 0 0 00 0 .159 .072 .131 .319 .197 0 0 00 0 0 .056 .103 .498 .103 .124 0 00 0 0 0 .186 .056 .046 .056 .046 00 0 0 0 0 .102 .085 .102 .128 .0960 0 0 0 0 0 .154 .176 .206 .2090 0 0 0 0 0 0 .308 .320 .3230 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .257 .2790 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .2870 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Figure 5: Similarity Matrix Sdld~d3d4dsd6d7dsd9dlodl d2 ds d4 ds d6 d7 ds d9 d,o0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 I 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 I 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 00 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 I0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0d2 dld4o ,C sd8d9dlOFigure 7: Directed Graph G1 for VFigure 6: Adjacency Matrix SS Converted from SThere are two threads in the graph.
One concernsfor France's restarting of nuclear testing.
The otherconcerns China's latest nuclear test.
The "France"thread contains two sub-threads.
One concern re-quests by other countries for France to reconsider itsstated intension of restarting nuclear testing, and theother concerns responses by other countries to theFrance government's official statement on testing.Some articles are followed by multiple articles.
Forexample, d7 is the first official statement on France'srestarting of nuclear testing, and many related arti-cles on this topic follow.Each rectangle in Figure 8 represents an article.Words in a rectangle are differentia words for thearticles.
These words show new information in thearticle, and make it easy to understand the contentof the articles.
If a word in an article appears inthe differentia words for its parent article, the wordmay represent a "turning point" in the story of thearticles.
For example, the word "state" is the dif-ferentia word for dT, and is in its adjacent articlesds, dg, anddlo.
This means that d7 is a starting pointof the new topic "state."
Such words are called topicwords, and are represented in Figure 8 by bold type.Several features of the graph visualize the charac-teristics and relationships of the articles: these fea-tures will be discussed in the next section.It is difficult to evaluate the result of threading.We are implementing it in a webcasting (push) ap-plication so that it can be evaluated by the manypeople who use ordinary web browsers.
The attemptis described in Section 5.4 Features  o f  a GraphThis section describes how the features of a con-structed graph represent the characteristics of arti-cles.4.1 In-degree and Out-degreeThe in-degree is the number of arcs leading to a node,while the out-degree is the number of arcs leadingfrom it.
The in-degree of di can be calculated byadding up the elements in the i-th column of an adja-cency matrix.
The out-degree of di can be calculatedby adding up the elements in the i-th row of the ma-trix (Figure 9).
In Botafogo et al (Botafogo et al,1992), a node that has a high out-degree is called anindex node, while a node that has a high in-degree iscalled a reference node in their analysis of hypertext.In the set of articles V shown in Figure 9, d7 is anindex node.
In this paper, an index node denotes thebeginning of a new topic.
When the topic is impor-tant, many articles follow, and consequently the out-1310dlFrance restartnuclear testingd4China latesthold-upnegotiationtreatyd3 d6halt Summit request France ~ New Zealandrestartnuc,earl /  _Isuggest \ [ /~Defence M i n i s t e ~~dd/r d8esident state \[state ,\[ hamperconduct~ 1 \[September \[ disarmament\ \ d9\ ~ Australia\ \] defence\[ cooperationChina , Mr. Yohei Kohno ~ U .S .

The contribution ofreference nodes is not clear in V (d6, ds, and d9 havemax in-degrees).
Nodes that have high in-degreehave two characteristics.
The first is that when thearticles contain multiple topics, they have many in-bound arcs, each representing a different topic.
Thesecond is that when the articles are closely relatedfor a particular topic, the in-degrees of related nodesincrease, since these articles are connected to eachother.4.2 PathA path from one node to another node shows the"story flow" of articles.
Multiple paths betweentwo nodes show different stories about the nodes.For example, there are three paths between dl,which is a first node, and dl0.
The shortest path(dl, d2,, dT, dl0) gives a simple outline of the articles.The longest path (d,, d2, d7, ds, dg, dl0) contains allrelated information on the topic.
By extracting longpaths from the graph and combining them, variousstories can be created.The length of a path shows how the nodes on it\[ along to the "main stream" of the story.
For ex-mple, the maximum length of a path through d6, isthree, while that of a path through d7 is five.
Thismeans that a path that contains d7 is on a mainstream of the thread and is likely to be continued.The longest paths for nodes can be calculated byusing the algorithm shown in Figure 11.
Its com-plexity is O(n), since the maximum number of arcsis at most nk for n nodes, from Constraint 2, definedin Section 3.2.4.3 CycleA cycle 3 shows the existence of a topic.
In V,{dT, ds, dg, dl0} is a cycle for the topic "statement.
"By recognizing cycles, we can extract opics from thewhole graph.
Furthermore, we can abstract articlesby reducing cycles to single nodes.5 XML-based  Representat ion  forThreadsIt is important that the threading information be ex-changeable when we apply our method to Web docu-ments.
Extended Markup Language (XML) is a pro-posed standard (XML, 1997) specified by the WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C).
In XML, tags and3Formally, it is called a semi-cycle, since the graph is di-rected.1311attributes can be defined, whereas in HTML theyare fixed.
XML documents can be used to exchangeinformation that has various data structure.
Forexample, Channel Definition Format (CDF)(CDF,1997) is a standard to offer frequently updated col-lections of information (channels) on Web.
A CDFdocument can contains a collection of articles thathave tree structure.
In this paper, graph structuresof created threads are represented in XML.
Figure 10shows a part of the thread in Figure 8.The <thread> tag shows the beginning of thethread.
It contains a set of deceptions for arti-cles, each marked <ar t i c le>.
Each instance ofthe <ar t i c le> tag has a reference to its sourcedocument, an identifying id, genus and differentiawords, and other information on the article.
Thetag <fo l lows> is used to denote arcs from the ar-ticle to related articles.The XML documents can be separate from thesource articles.
They can be provided as part of a"push" service for Internet users, offering a solutionto the problem of information overloading.
In sucha service, gatherer collects articles from Web sitesand threader makes threads for them.
The resultsare stored in XML, and then pushed to subscriberswho can capture the flow of topics by following thethreads.
In another scenario, when a user gets anarticle, and wants to see its origin or the next re-lated article, he or she gets the thread containingthe article by consulting the threading server.
Theadvantage of using XML is that it will be supportedby various tools, including Web browsers.
Now weare prototyping the threading service system by us-ing a XML processor developed at our laboratory.Figure 12 shows a Java applet for viewing threads,which can run on major Web browsers.
A XML doc-ument is parsed and visualized as tree-like structure.6 Re la ted  WorkThere have been several studies how to relate arti-cles (McKeown et al, 1995; Yamamoto et al, 1995;Mani et al, 1997).
McKeown et al reported amethod for summarizing news articles (McKeownet al, 1995).
In their approach, templates, whichhave slots and their values (for example, incident-location="New York"), are extracted from the ar-ticles.
Summary sentences are constructed by com-bining the templates.
Although this approach cancapture topics contained in the articles, the relation-ships between articles are not visualized.Clustering techniques make it possible to visual-ize the contents of a set of documents.
Hearst etal.
proposed the scatter/gather approach for facil-itating information retrieval (Hearst et al, 1995).Maarek et al related documents by using an hier-archical clustering algorithm that interacts with theuser.
Although these clustering algorithms impose aprocedure GetMaxtPath(A)/ /Get  max path MaxPath\[i\] for di.

An efficient hread-ing algorithm whose complexity is O(n) (where n isthe number of articles) was introduced with someconstraints on the chronological ordering of articles.Some further work can be done to improve ourmethod.
There are sonie strategies for constructingan adjacency matrix from a distance matrix.
Differ-ent strategies give different graphs.
We are now eval-uating our method by testing it with various strate-gies.The development of a technique for visualizing di-rected graphs is another task for the future.
Al-though directed graphs show more useful informa-tion than tree structures, they are difficult to displayin a readily understandable way.
Software tools forhandling graphs are also required.Formal features of graphs can express the under-lying characteristics of articles.
More efficient anduseful algorithms are needed to overcome the prob-lem of information overload.Re ferencesR.
