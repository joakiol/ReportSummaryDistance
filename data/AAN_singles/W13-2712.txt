Wedescribe the various steps that lead to a run-ning IE system: lexicalization of the labels ofthe thesaurus and semi-automatic generationof domain specific IE grammars, with theirsubsequent implementation in a finite stateengine.
Finally, we outline the actual field ofapplication of the IE system: analysis of so-cial media for recognition of relevant topicsin the context of elections.1 IntroductionWithin a running research project dealing withthe automatic linguistic and semantic processingof social media1, we are working on a use caseconcerned with the analysis of tweets exchangedin the context of approaching election events.Besides the detection of Named Entities (nameof politicians, political parties, locations, etc.
)and associated opinions, we are also interested inidentifying and classifying the topics people areaddressing in their messages.There are for sure topics that are very particu-lar to a specific election, but there are also moregeneric and recurrent topics, some of them beingof special interest to social scientists.
In order tobe able to detect such topics in various types oftext, we have been searching for knowledgesources in the field of social and political sci-ences that can be used for the corresponding(both manual and automatic) semantic annotation1The TrendMiner project, www.trendminer-project.eu,co-funded by the European Commission with Grant No.287863.of text.
Our best candidate is for the time beingthe Thesaurus for the Social Sciences (TheSoz),developed by the GESIS institute at the LeibnizInstitute for the Social Sciences2.
This resource isavailable in the SKOS format 3 , and thereforeadapted to the Linked Data framework4.
In thisshort paper we present first in some details thethesaurus, before describing the steps that allowus to integrate the (multilingual) language data itincludes into a NLP tools suite, for the goal ofsupporting Knowledge-Driven analysis of textsin the field of social sciences, with a focus onmicro-blogs.2 The Thesaurus for the Social Sciences(TheSoz)The thesaurus for social sciences is a knowledgesource under continuous development (we arecurrently using version 0.92).
The list of key-words used in TheSoz contains about 12,000 en-tries, of which more than 8,000 are descriptors(or ?authorized keywords?
).It is encoded in RDF and SKOS.
While themain conceptual elements of the thesaurus areencoded in the core syntax of SKOS, the re-source makes also use of the SKOS-XL proper-ties5 for including labels containing natural lan-guage expressions (authorized keywords, whichact as domain terms) that are attached to the con-ceptual elements., using the ?prefLabel?
and?altLabel?
annotation properties, allowing thus todescribe main terms and their variants.
The natu-ral language expressions corresponding to thelabels are encoding using the SKOS-XL annota-tion property ?literalForm?.2http://www.gesis.org/en/services/research/thesauri-und-klassifikationen/social-science-thesaurus/3See http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/ for a conciseintroduction to SKOS.4http://linkeddata.org/5See http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/skos-xl.html90In order to give a (human readable) idea of thecontent of the thesaurus6 , we extracted with aPerl script the main elements from the SKOScode and present those in a tabular fashion, anexample of which is given below, displaying alsothe terms in the languages covered by TheSoz(English, French and German):concept id "10034303"term ?10034303"?
prefLabel id "10034303"?
lang=de "Abbrecher"?
lang=en "drop-out"?
lang=fr "drop-out"?
altLabel id "10034307"?

lang=de ?Interdiszipin?re Anwendungsbereicheder Sozialwissenschaften??

lang=fr ?
domaines interdisciplinaires d'applica-tion des sciences sociales ?In the example above the reader can see how theEnglish preferred label ?drop-out?
is associatedwith the concept ?School and Occupation?,which is itself a subclass of the concept ?Occu-pation and Qualification?, classified itself as afield of the broader concept ?InterdisciplinaryApplication Areas of Social Sciences?.
All thelanguage material contained in the labels or usedfor naming the ?notations?
can be re-used fordetecting and semantically annotating the relatedtopics in running texts.3 TheSoz as Linked DataThe encoding of TheSoz in SKOS is an impor-tant asset, since it allows linking the data to other6Online visualizations and access are available athttp://lod.gesis.org/thesoz/knowledge sources, like for example DBpedia7 inthe Linked Data framework, and so to comple-ment information contained in TheSoz, whichremains at the terminological level, and is thusnot giving detailed information about the in-cluded multilingual terms for the described con-cepts and the relations between those.So for example TheSoz mentions the main po-litical parties in Germany, Austria and othercountries, but not their actual leader, their actualrole (in the government or in the opposition) orweight in the current legislation period.
TheSozalso lists the names of important persons, like?Merkel, A.?
or ?Brandt, W.?, but no biographi-cal indication or relation to political parties orinstitutions are given.
As such TheSoz is provid-ing for a light-weight ontological basis, withmultilingual labels, which allows detecting intext mentions of topics or entities relevant to thesocial scientists.The linking of concepts and associated termsto more elaborated knowledge sources, likeDBpedia, is thus necessary in order to implementa full Knowledge Driven Information Extraction(KDIE) system in the field of social sciences.
Sofor example the TheSoz sub-term ?university?
in?university drop-out?
can be completed by in-formation in the DBpedia entry for ?university?,stating among others that ?university?
is rdfsdomain of ?numberOfPostgraduateStudents?
andthat it is a subClassOf ?EducationalInstitution.?http://schema.org/EducationalOrganization?
isgiven as an equivalenceClass of the DBpediaentry for ?EducationalInstitution?.
From theschema.org entry we can make use of additionalrelations associated to ?EducationalInstitution?,like for example a relation to more specifictypes, such as ?CollegeOrUniversity?, ?Elemen-tarySchool?, ?HighSchool?, ?MiddleSchool?,?Preschool?,  ?School?.
We can this way expandthe terminological base of TheSoz by accessingthe labels of the classes and concepts of otherknowledge sources referred to by explicit seman-tic relations like owl:equivalentClass,owl:sameAs or skos:exactMatch.As the reader can see from the name of thementioned ontology classes above, natural lan-guage expressions associated to elements ofknowledge sources can have different surfaceforms as the one we saw in the examples of ?lit-eralForms?
of TheSoz.
Beyond the utilization ofthe annotation properties, such as rdfs:label,7See http://dbpedia.org/About.
And in fact, 5024 TheSozconcepts are linked to DBpedia via SKOS ?exact matches?.91skosxl:prefLabel?
or skosxl:literalForm, dedi-cated to ease the understanding by human users,several other syntax elements of knowledge rep-resentation systems, such as the RDF URI refer-ences, like rdf:ID, rdf:about, or rdf:resource, maycontain instead of numerical codes natural lan-guage expressions, often using the CamelCasenotation.
Fu et al(2012) describes NLP tasksand applications using natural language expres-sions contained in such RDF URI references.
Inour work, we  focus on natural language expres-sions contained in the annotation propertiesrdfs:label, sxkos:label (skosxl:prefLabel and oth-ers) and skosxl:literalForm, which typically in-clude textual material to be consumed by humanreaders, and which can be normally directly pro-cessed by NLP tools, without requiring priortransformation processes of the textual material.4 Integration of TheSoz  in a NLPFrameworkBefore applying the (possibly extended) termino-logical material of TheSoz for supporting thesemantic annotation of running texts, it has to besubmitted to pre-processing steps, in order toensure as a minimum a possible matching tomorpho-syntactic variations of (elements of) theterms that are to be expected in external text.
Forthis, we need to lexicalize the labels of the the-saurus, transforming the terms to linguistic datathat can be used for matching linguistically proc-essed text.
A first sketch of this approach hasbeen described in (Declerck & Lendvai, 2010)and a more elaborated methodology, encodingthe linguistic data in RDF is presented in(McCrae et al2012).And for ensuring a linking of linguistic data intext to the conceptual elements of the thesaurus(or other knowledge sources), the developmentof an information extraction grammar is needed.We present in section 3.2 below an automatizedapproach for this.For both steps we are using the NooJ plat-form8 , whose finite states engine supports theflexible implementation of lexicons, morpho-logical, syntactic and semantic grammars.4.1 LexicalizationThe lexicalization step consists in submitting allthe language material included in the knowledgesource to a lexical and a syntactic analyzer,8http://www.nooj4nlp.net/pages/nooj.htmlwhich in our case are lexicons and grammarsimplemented in NooJ.The results of such a processing can be en-coded in the lexicon-ontology model lemon(McCrae et al2012), which declaratively repre-sents textual and linguistic information of on-tologies as additional RDF resource linked to theoriginal concepts associated to the labels.
Thelemon model decomposes multi-word expres-sions to individual words and represents the re-sults in a phrase structure, which can be sharedby multiple lexical entries.
Furthermore, depend-ency relations between decomposed phrase con-stituents can be modeled.
A simplified exampleof the lemon representation of the NooJ parsedterm ?university drop-out?
is shown below::university_drop-out [lemon:writtenRep "univer-sity drop-out"@en]lemon:sense [lemon:reference ontol-ogy:TheSoz10034307];lemon:decomposition ( :university_comp:drop-out_comp ) ;lemon:phraseRoot [ lemon:constituent :NP ;lemon:edge [lemon:constituent :NP ;lemon:edge [lemon:constituent :NN ;lemon:leaf university_comp ] ;lemon:edge [lemon:constituent :NN ;lemon:leaf drop-out_comp ] ];].For the sake of simplicity we do not display thelemon representation of additional analysis pro-vided by NooJ (for example the one, which isdecomposing ?drop-out?
in two lemmas).
It isenough to mention that lemon also supports therepresentation of preferred and alternative labels.This is important if one wants to consider allpossible (linguistically annotated) term variantsfor improving the matching of TheSoz terms toterminological variants in text, going thus be-yond the matching of terms to purely morpho-syntactic variations.
So for example, in TheSoz?drop-out?
is the prefLabel, while ?universitydrop-out?
is marked as altLabel of the same con-cept.
Such term variants can also be ?imported?in our lexicalization step from other source.
Orone can import additional lexical material, so forexample the corresponding WordNet synonymsor glosses.
In the next future we also plan to?tap?
the BabelNet9 resource, which is providinglinks to WordNet, Wikipedia and DBpedia (andmore is planed), for extending the terminological9See http://lcl.uniroma1.it/babelnet/ or (Navigli &Ponzetto, 2012).92base of the (lexicalized) TheSoz labels, also withterms in languages not covered by TheSoz fornow.4.2 Automatic Generation of Domain spe-cific IE grammarsOn the basis of the lexicalization step describedin section 3.1, we wrote a Perl program that gen-erates IE grammars in the NooJ finite state en-gine.
This procedure is done in 5 steps.1) Using the Term ID of TheSoz as namesfor NooJ recognition rules.term10034307 =2) Using the corresponding lexicalised la-bels as the expressions to be recognizedby the NooJ rule (abstract representa-tion):term10034307 = [lemma=?university?cat=?N?]
[lemma=?drop-out?cat=?N?]
;3) Adding possible term variants to therule) 10:term10034307 = ([lemma=?university?cat=?N?]
[lemma=?drop-out?cat=?N?]
| :var10034307) ;var10034307 = [lemma=?university?cat=?N?]
[lemma=?drop?
cat=?V?][lemma=?out?
cat=?P?]
;4) Linking the linguistically annotated pre-fLabel and the altLabel(s) to the corre-sponding Concept ID, as the basis of thesemantic organization of the lexical ma-terial in NooJ:concept10034303 = (term10034303 |term10034307) ;5) Defining the annotation generation pro-cedure of the NooJ rules: Successful ap-plication of  the rule  concept10034303can generate the following annotation:CLASS= TheSoz_ID=?10034303?altLabel_ID=?10034307?altLabel =?universtiy drop-out@en?SuperClass=TheSoz_ID_3.210In this simplified example we do just include as aterm variant the decomposition of the noun ?drop-out?
in two lemmas, extending thus the lexical cover-age of the original label.
The final rule (not displayedhere for the sake of simplicity) is also stating that thesub-term ?university?
doesn?t have to immediatelyprecede the sub-term ?drop?, accounting thus also foralternative word order.SuperClassLabel = ?Occupation andQualification?altLabel_Translation  = ?Studienabbre-cher@de?etc.11  )This procedure has been fully implemented, us-ing Perl scripts.
The addition of term variants (inred color in the example above, point 3) can bedone manually or automatically.
We are also cur-rently adding information about the context ofsuch terms to be expected in running texts, likefor example the agent of the event ?drop-out?,and further modifications, like date, location andreasons.At the moment we are able to semanticallydisambiguate in text for example the two sensesof the TheSoz term ?drop-out?
: one in the senseof ?university drop-out?
and the one in the senseof ?resignation from occupation?.
The generatedNooJ grammars are currently being tested for ause case dealing with the elections in Austria.5 Use CaseOur actual focus is the elections in Austria.
Ouraim is to detect which topics are of have beendiscussed in the social media, and how this re-lates to election results obtained by candidatesand parties.As such we cannot report yet on evaluation re-sults, both at the technological and usability lev-el, since an evaluation study is still to be per-formed.
We will be using collection of polls formeasuring the accuracy of the detection of topicsand the related popularity of parties/politiciansdetected in social media.The use case partner involved in the projecthas been designing an annotation schema and isperforming a semi-automatic annotation of se-lected tweets and blogs, which we will use asgold standard.A fully operational system is expected to workfor the national elections in Austria to be held onthe 28th September of 2013.6 Future WorkBesides the evaluation work sketched in the for-mer section, the next steps in our work will con-sist in aggregating information from other11An example text is: ?Mar 29, 2012 ?
Record num-bers of students quit university courses last year as thehigher education drop-out rate soared above 30000for the first time?
?93knowledge source, not only from DBpedia butalso from a recently developed political ontol-ogy, which has been designed in the context ofour project.We have also already conducted experimentsin relating the linguistically annotated terms ofTheSoz with terms available in other thesauri,like for example GEMET12.
As GEMET is con-taining labels in 33 languages, this linking willallow us to find more multilingual equivalents ofterms in TheSoz, at least for the concepts ofTheSoz that can be associated with concepts inGEMET.Another line of investigation will consist inadapting the work on correcting and comple-menting the labels used in TheSoz, following thereports described in (Declerck & Gromann,2012), where correcting and completive patternshave been applied to the labels of multilingualtaxonomies dealing with the description of indus-try activity fields of companies listed in variousstock exchanges.
Improving the terminologicalquality of labels seems to be a good strategy forimproving knowledge-driven information extrac-tion.Following the approaches to cross-lingual har-monization of taxonomy labels described in (De-clerck & Gromann, 2012; Gromann & Declerck,2013), we notice that in many multilingualknowledge sources (Thesauri, Taxonomies orOntologies), the content of multilingual labels isnot parallelized.
In one of our example within theTheSoz, displayed in Section 2, we had the fol-lowing concept with the labels in three lan-guages:term "10034303"concept  id "10034303"?altLabel id "10034307"altLabel de "Studienabbrecher"altLabel en "university drop-out"altLabel fr "?tudiant qui abandonne ses ?tudes"?.As the reader can see, only the French label iscontaining explicitly the fact the entity ?perform-ing?
the drop-out is a student.
Although the su-per-classes make clear that ?university drop-out?is in the field of ?School and Occupation?, noneof the metadata or labels, other as the French?altLabel?
is mentioning that a student is in-12GEMET stands for ?GEneral Multilingual Envi-ronmental Thesaurus?.
See alsohttp://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/volved in this field.
The German label can lead tothe reading that a person is involved, if adequatelexical semantics resources are used.
The Englishlabel does not mention at all that an agent is in-volved: it just names the event.
The French andGerman labels are about abandoning ?studies?while the English label is about abandoning?university?.As suggested by Gromann & Declerck (2013),we can add (either manually or by automatedprocess) to the English alternative labels thetranslations of the French label (in this particularcase, the one with the richest contextual informa-tion), like ?a student, who is dropping out hisstudies?.
This is important since it improves thematching of the concepts of TheSoz to runningtexts.7 ConclusionWe have described actual work in integratingmultilingual knowledge sources in the field ofsocial sciences into a NLP task, consisting inidentifying relevant topics of discussion in socialmedia.
As it is still too early to report on results(due to the internal calendar of the project), wecould only present for the time being the currentstate of implementation, which consisted in firstlexicalizing the labels of the knowledge source?TheSoz?, freely available ?
in the SKOS for-mat.
On the basis of the lexicalized labels, andtheir relation to conceptual element of theknowledge source, we implemented an automaticgeneration of knowledge-driven IE grammars,which have been realized as finite state transduc-ers in the NooJ platform.
Those resulting IEgrammars are to be deployed in the context of ause case dealing with the detection of topics ad-dressed in social media on approaching elections.AcknowledgmentsThe work presented in this paper has been sup-ported by the TrendMiner project, co-funded bythe European Commission with Grant No.287863.The author is thanking the reviewers for theirvery helpful comments, which led to substantialchanges brought to the final version of the paper.The author is also thanking Dagmar Gromann(Vienna University of Economics and Business).Intensive discussions with her on related topicshave been heavily inspiring the work describedin this paper.94ReferencesDeclerck, T., Lendvai, P. 2010.
