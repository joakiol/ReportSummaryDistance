documentation in Polish.
Forboth document types, values of sets of at-tributes were assigned using specially de-signed grammars.1 Method/General AssumptionsVarious rule-based, statistical, and machine learn-ing methods have been developed for the purposeof information extraction.
Unfortunately, they haverarely been tested on Polish texts, whose rich in-flectional morphology and relatively free word or-der is challenging.
Here, we present results of twoexperiments aimed at extracting information frommammography reports and hospital records of dia-betic patients.1 Since there are no annotated corporaof Polish medical text which can be used in super-vised statistical methods, and we do not have enoughdata for weakly supervised methods, we chose therule-based extraction schema.
The processing pro-cedure in both experiments consisted of four stages:text preprocessing, application of IE rules based onthe morphological information and domain lexicons,postprocessing (data cleaning and structuring), andconversion into a relational database.Preprocessing included format unification, dataanonymization, and (for mammography reports) au-tomatic spelling correction.The extraction rules were defined as grammarsof the SProUT system, (Droz?dz?yn?ski et al, 2004).1This work was partially financed by the Polish nationalproject number 3 T11C 007 27.SProUT consists of a set of processing componentsfor basic linguistic operations, including tokeniza-tion, sentence splitting, morphological analysis (forPolish we use Morfeusz (Wolin?ski, 2006)) andgazetteer lookup.
The SproUT components are com-bined into a pipeline that generates typed featurestructures (TFS), on which rules in the form of reg-ular expressions with unification can operate.
Smallspecialized lexicons containing both morphologi-cal and semantic (concept names) information havebeen created for both document types.Extracted attribute values are stored in a rela-tional database.2 Before that, mammography re-ports results undergo additional postprocessing ?grouping together of extracted data.
Specially de-signed scripts put limits that separate descriptions ofanatomical changes, tissue structure, and diagnosis.More details about mammography IE system can befound in (Mykowiecka et al, 2005).2 Document typesFor both document types, partial ontologies were de-fined on the basis of sample data and expert knowl-edge.
To formalize them, we used OWL-DL stan-dard and the Prote?ge?
ontology editor.
The excerptfrom the ontology is presented in Fig.
1.In both cases, the relevant part of the ontologywas translated into a TFS hierarchy.
This resulted in176 types with 66 attributes for the mammographydomain, and 139 types (including 75 drug names)with 65 attributes for diabetic patients?
records.2This last stage is completed for the diabetes reports whilefor mammography it is still under development.181BiochemicalData: BloodData: HB1CDietDiseaseOrSymptomDiseaseAutoimmuneDiseaseCancerDiabetes: Type1, Type2, TypeOtherSymptomAngiopathy: Macroangiopathy, MicroangiopathyBoodSymptom: HypoglicaemiaNeuropathy: Autonomic, PeripheralPolineuropathyUrineSymptom: Acetonuria, MicroalbuminuriaMedicineDiabeticMedicine: Insulin, OralDiabeticMedicineAnatomicalLocalizationBodyPartBreast: Subareola, urq, ulq, lrq, llqBodySide: Left, RightHistDiagnosis: Benign, Suspicious, MalignantTissueSpecification: GlandularTissue, FatTissueFigure 1: A sample of classes3 Extraction GrammarsThe number of rules is highly related to the numberof attributes and possible ways of formulating theirvalues.
The grammar for mammography reportscontains 190 rules; that for hospital records containsabout 100 rules.
For the first task, nearly the entiretext is covered by the rules, while for the second,only a small part of the text is extracted (e.g., frommany blood tests we are interested only in HBA1C).Polish inflection is handled by using the morpho-logical analyzer and by inserting the most frequentmorphological forms into the gazetteer.
Free wordorder is handled either by rules which describe allpossible orderings, or by extracting small pieces ofinformation which are merged at the postprocessingstage.

The zp and zk markers areinserted during the information structuring stage torepresent borders of an anatomical change descrip-tion.
Similar markers are introduced to structure thetissue description part.4 EvaluationThe experiments were evaluated on a set of previ-ously unseen reports.
Extraction of the followingstructures was evaluated: 1) simple attributes (e.g.diabetes balance); 2) structured attributes (e.g.
lo-calization); and 3) complex structures (e.g.
descrip-tion of abnormal findings).
Evaluation of three se-lected attributes from both sets is given in Fig.

In the nextstage, we plan to use our tools for creating anno-tated corpora of medical texts (manually corrected).These data can be used to train statistical IE modelsand to evaluate other extraction systems.ReferencesAgnieszka Mykowiecka, Anna Kups?c?, Ma?gorzataMarciniak.
