It is common thatclaims written in Japanese are described inone sentence with peculiar style and word-ing and are difficult to understand for ordi-nary people.
The peculiarity is caused bystructural complexity of the sentences andmany difficult terms used in the descrip-tion.
We have already proposed a frame-work to represent the structure of patentclaims and a method to automatically an-alyze it.
We are currently investigating amethod to clarify terms in patent claimsand to find the explanatory portions fromthe detailed description part of the patentspecifications.
Through both approaches,we believe we can improve readability ofpatent claims.1 IntroductionThe importance of intellectual property, specificallypatent, is being recognized more than ever.
In theacademia, patent is being considered as the corecomponent for technology transfer to industry.
Withthe upsurge of business method patents and softwarepatents, more and more business persons are con-cerned about patent.Patent is described in patent specification which isa kind of legal documents.
The most important partof patent specification is where the claims are writ-ten, because ?the claims specify the boundaries ofthe legal monopoly created by the patent?
(Burgun-der, 1995).
Therefore, we believe that patent corpusprocessing should be centered around patent claimprocessing.It is common that Japanese patent claims are de-scribed in one sentence with peculiar style and word-ing and that they are difficult to read and under-stand for ordinary people.
After surveying relatedliterature and investigating NTCIR3 patent collec-tion (Iwayama et al, 2003), we found the difficultyhas two aspects: structural difficulty and term diffi-culty.In this paper, we first present the characteristicsof patent claims.
Next, we present our work on thestructure analysis of patent claims.
Third, we intro-duce our on-going research on term explanation forpatent claims.2 Characteristics of Patent ClaimTypical Japanese patent claims taken from twopatents are shown in Figure 1 and 2.In general, Japanese sentences are inserted withthe touten ???
or ???
(comma) and end with thekuten ???
or ???
(period) .
The touten plays arole of segmenting the sentence for disambiguatingthe meaning and for improving readability.
Accord-ing to the literature (Maekawa, 1995), the averagelength of Japanese sentences is 55.85 characters innewspaper articles on politics and 75.37 characterson social affairs articles.The claims of Figure 1 and 2 are both writtenin one sentence.
Though they are appropriately in-????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

)serted with the touten ??
?, they are unusually longwith the length of 295 characters and 119 charac-ters.
It is definitely true that most Japanese who arenot accustomed to reading patent claims have diffi-culty in reading them.
In fact, according to (Kasuya,1999), Japanese patent attorneys themselves recog-nize that Japanese patent claims are difficult to read.The salient characteristics of Japanese patentclaims from the viewpoint of readability are as fol-lows:1.
The length of sentence is long.2.
The structure of description is complex.3.
There are several terms which are difficult tounderstand or requires explanation for under-standing.To examine the first point, we extracted all of thefirst claims of the sample data (59,968 patents) in theNTCIR3 patent collection, and calculated the aver-age sentence length.
We found that it is 242 char-acters and confirmed that Japanese patent claims areunusually long.With regard to the second point, we surveyedseveral books and articles written for patent appli-cants to explain how to draft patent claims(Kasai,1999; Kasuya, 1999) and how to translate patentclaims(Lise, 2002).Based on the survey, we classify the descriptionstyle into the following three.

In the firsthalf part, either the known or the preconditionpart is described.
In the last half part, either thenew or the main part is described 1.These patterns are not mutually exclusive.
For ex-ample, the first half part of the Jepson-like style maybe written in the process sequence style or in the el-ement enumeration style.With regard to the third point, Figure 1 containsthe term ?????????
(an actuator) and Figure2 contains the term ???????
(sticky ink) whichrequire explanation for understanding.Because of these characteristics, the well-knownJapanese parser KNP (Kurohashi, 2000) incorrectlyanalyze or cannot process most of the Japanesepatent claims.KNP?s dependency analysis works by detectingparallel structure utilizing thesaurus and dynamicprogramming, but it does not work well for patent1Note that the term ?Jepson claim?
is rigidly defined andused in Europe or in the USA to describe the kind of claimsin which the known part and the new part are clearly sepa-rated.
In Japan, that is not common and the separation is morevague(Lise, 2002).
That?s why we name this as ?Jepson-likestyle?.Table 1: Relations for Japanese patent claimsType Relation Explanation ExampleMulti- PROCEDURE Process Sequence [???][???][???

To do so, the struc-ture needs to be analyzed first.Japanese patent claims are described in such away that multiple sentences are coerced into onesentence(Kasuya, 1999).
In other words, a claimis composed of multiple sentences that have somekind of relationships with each other.
Therefore, wedecided to apply the RST (Rhetorical Structure The-ory) (Mann, 1999) that was proposed to analyze dis-course structure composed of multiple sentences.RST was proposed in the 1980?s and has beensuccessfully applied to automatic summarization(Marcu, 2000), automatic layout (John Bateman,2000), and so on.
A Tcl/Tk-based interactive tool(OD?onnel, 1997) was developed to support to man-ually edit and to visually show the structure.3.2 FrameworkFor the structure analysis of Japanese patent claims,we defined six relations as in Table 1.
Two of themare multi-nuclear where composing elements areequally important.
Four of them are mono-nuclearwhere one element is nucleus, the other is satellite,and the nucleus is more important than the satellite.In the ?Example?
column of Table 1, the regions en-closed with ?[?
and ?]?
are segments or spans andthe underlined ones are nuclei.Given the patent claims in Figure 1 and Figure2, we can analyze their structure and present themvisually by using RSTTool (OD?onnel, 1997) as inFigure 3 and Figure 4 2.3.3 Cue-phrase-based ApproachIn designing the algorithm, we took a similar ap-proach to (Marcu, 2000).
We collected cue phrasesthat can be used for segmenting long claims and es-tablishing relations among segments or spans.2Because RSTTool is written in Tcl/Tk and Tcl/Tk is an in-ternationalized language, we did not have to localize it to dis-play Japanese characters.Figure 3: A result of structure analysis of patent claim in Figure 1 (using RSTTool v2.7)Figure 4: A result of structure analysis of patent claim in Figure 2 (using RSTTool v2.7)Table 2: Description pattern just before the newlinesin claims in which newline are explicitly insertedNo Pattern Ratio1 (Noun|Symbol)?

]Cue phrases were first collected manually byreading patent claims.
Then we found that about halfof the claims are inserted with newlines at seeminglysegment boundaries as in Figure 2.We investigated all of the extracted first claimsof the sample data and 48.5% of them are newline-inserted claims.
It seems that the drafters of patentclaims explicitly inserted those newlines for read-ability for themselves.
We checked the descriptionpattern of the last three morphemes just before eachnewline of those claims.
The result is shown in Ta-ble 2.
In Table 2, ?Verb-Cont-Form?
means ???????
(verb in continuous form) and ?AuxVerb-Cont-Form?
means ????????
(auxiliary verbin continuous form).
Note that the description pat-terns are expressed in the regular expression notationof Perl.Summarizing the above, we came up with thecue phrases in Table 3.
In Table 3, ?Verb-Basic-Form?
means ???????
(verb in basic form)and ?AuxVerb-Basic-Form?
means ????????
(auxiliary verb in basic form).3.4 Algorithm and ImplementationWe designed an algorithm for analyzing structureof independent claims3.
Although patent claims arewritten in natural language, it?s not written in a freeform and is restricted in a sense that there are de-scription styles established in the community.
So,we designed an algorithm composed of a lexical an-alyzer and a parser as in the formal language proces-sors.3Independent claims are claims which do not refer to anyother claims.First, the input claim is analyzed with the morpho-logical analyzer ?chasen?
(Matsumoto et al, 2002).Because some patent claims explicitly contain new-lines as in Figure 2, we use the ?-j?
option settingthe sentence delimiter as ?????
in ?.chasenrc?.Next, the output from chasen is analyzed with thelexical analyzer.
The main point of our algorithmis the context-dependent behavior of the lexical ana-lyzer as follows:?
The lexical analyzer outputs two types of to-ken: cue phrase token and morpheme token.?
Outputting morpheme tokens is done depend-ing on some contextual conditions to avoid am-biguities in the parsing.?
For other morphemes whose context did notsatisfy the above conditions, an anonymousmorpheme token (WORD) is output.Next, the output from the lexical analyzer is pro-cessed with the parser generated from a context-freegrammar (CFG) by using Bison (Donnelly and Stall-man, 1995)-compatible parser generator.
The CFGwe designed for Japanese patent claim consists of 57rules, 11 terminals, and 19 non-terminals.Finally, a structure tree is constructed in the formof ?.rs2?
file used in RSTTool v2.7.
By using RST-Tool, the output is visually displayed as in Figure 3and Figure 4.3.5 EvaluationThe evaluation was done by using the first claims 4of 59,956 patents extracted from the NTCIR3 patentdata collection.The NTCIR3 patent data collection consists of697,262 patents opened to public in 1998 and in1999.
For the analysis, the collection of cue phrases,and the creation of the CFG, we used patents in1998.
For the evaluation, we used patents in 1999.We checked the IPC (International Patent Classi-fication) code of 59,956 patents and confirmed thatthe distribution is similar to the one of all openedpatents in 1999 disclosed by JPO (Japan Patent Of-fice).The evaluation was done in the following points:4First claims are always independent claims.Table 3: Cue phrases which can be used to analyze patent claimsToken Name Cue Phrase GlossJEPSON CUE ?

The pro-cessing speed was 0.30 second per each claim (eval-uated on a Linux PC using Pentium III 1GHz and512MB memory).
So, it is almost real-time.3.5.1 Indirect Evaluation on AccuracyBy specifying a command-line switch, our pro-gram can be run without utilizing the originally in-serted newlines.
The newline insertion positions canbe predicted by the result of structure analysis andsome heuristics.
So, indirect evaluation was done bycomparing the newline insertion positions betweenthe originally newline-inserted claims and the auto-matically newline-inserted claims utilizing the resultof structure analysis.
The recall(R), the precision(P),and the F-measure(F) are calculated by the follow-ings, where c is the number of correctly-insertednewlines, n is the number of newlines in the orig-inal claim, and i is the number of inserted newlines.R =cn(1)P =ci(2)F =2 ?
R ?
PR + P(3)The baseline was set in that the newlines are in-serted mechanically at the end of every sequenceof ?(NOUN|SYMBOL)(?|?)?
and ?(Verb-Cont-Form|AuxVerb-Cont-Form)(?|?
)?.Note that newlines are sometimes inserted at thepositions that are not segment boundaries in themeaning of RST.
For example, it is often the casethat at the end of ????
(a postpositional particlerepresenting the subject), newlines are inserted.
So,our newline-insertion prediction algorithm has theinherent upper limit whose recall is 0.873.The result is shown in Table 4.Table 4: Evaluation result (Indirect)Index Baseline Newline UpperInsertion LimitutilizingRSTRecall(R) 0.478 0.674 0.8736Precision(P) 0.374 0.663 N/AF-measure 0.420 0.669 N/ATable 5: Evaluation result (Direct)Category Count Percentage(Except?No judgment?

All ofthese claims are the first claims.
Again, we checkedthe distribution of IPC and confirmed it?s similar tothe one of all opened patents in 1999 disclosed byJPO.The 100 claims were analyzed by our programand the visually-displayed outputs like Figure 3 and4 were presented to a subject who had some expe-rience in reading patent specifications.
The subjectevaluated the result by the following criteria:?
when the claim is in the Jepson-like style,whether that is correctly recognized.?
when the claim is in the Jepson-like style,whether the structure is correctly analyzed forthe first half part and for the last half part.?
when the claim is not in the Jepson-like style,whether the structure is correctly analyzed forthe whole.The result is shown in Table 5.3.6 Application to Patent Claim ParaphraseOnce the structure of patent claims are analyzed, wecan apply the result to paraphrase patent claims.To do so, the following actions are incorporatedinto the lexical analyzer and the parser.?
The lexical analyzer deletes the words ????
(the), ???
(the), and ????
(the).?
For the parser, new actions are added which re-locates the ?noun group?
located at the end tothe front.
Same thing for the ?noun group?
lo-cated just before JEPSON CUE for the Jepson-like style claims.?
For the process sequence style, the lexical an-alyzer conjugates verbs and adverbs from theircontinuous form to basic form and replaces thetouten ?(?|?)?
with the kuten ???.?
For the element enumeration style, the lexicalanalyzer converts those cue phrases such as ??????
(consist of) and ??????
(include)to their ??????(?teiru?
form) plus ???
anddeletes ??
(?|?)?
(and) at the end of each el-ement.?
The lexical analyzer converts ????
(thing)just before ????????
(characterized by)to ????
(the following).?
For the Jepson-like style, the parser separatesthe first-half part and the last-half part by in-serting a newline.By doing the above processing, long patent claimsentences are divided into multiple sentences.
Butas there are cases where some of the generated sen-tences are still too long, those sentences longer thanthe threshold length (75 characters) are recursivelyprocessed.An example of paraphrase is shown in Figure 5.We believe that paraphrasing can not only im-prove readability of patent claims but also can workeffectively as a preprocessing for machine transla-tion 5.5In fact, there are several commercial machine translationsoftware which does special preprocessing for patent claims be-fore translating from Japanese to English.???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????:????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
?Figure 5: A sample paraphrase for Figure 14 Term Explanation for Patent Claims4.1 Background and MotivationOnce the structure of patent claims are analyzedand presented visually, next hurdle for readability isterms.There are many novel terms used in patent claimdescription.
They can be classified into the follow-ing categories:Terms specific to the invention Patent drafters of-ten assign unique names to the invention, itselements, and its processes for their identifica-tion.Terms specific to the domain The patent law re-quires patents should be written so that thosewho have ordinary knowledge in the domaincan understand and perform the invention.
So,technical terms that are established in the do-main are often used.
Additionally, there exist?patent jargons?
which are created by combin-ing two kanji characters such as ????
(putand insert) and ????
(put into the hall)(Kasai,1999).
They are first created by some patentdrafters for the sake of brevity and have beenwidely used in the community.
So, they areterms specific to the inventions of the domain.Those who do not have enough knowledge inthe domain or those who are not accustomed toreading patent specifications have difficulty inunderstanding them.Giving appropriate explanations for these termswould help to improve readability of patent claims.4.2 ApproachFirst of all, it is necessary to recognize terms to beexplained.
There are many research issues in termextraction in general, but for our purpose we usethe following morphological pattern to extract termsfrom patent claims:(Prefix)*(Noun|Unknown-Words|Symbol|Verb-Cont-Form|Verb-Compound-With-Indeclinable-Word)+By using the above pattern, we can extract suchterms as ??????????
(method to blow heatwind), ?????
(read value), and ????
(liquiddrop) which contain verbs.Second, by using the result of structure analysis,we can infer the categories of the terms as follows:?
If the term appears at the end of the claim orjust before the JEPSON CUE in the Jepson-like style, or just before ???
(and) in the el-ement enumeration style, it is a term specificto the invention.
For example, ?????????????
(an operational virtual oscillationgenerating device) and ????????
(a loaddetection method) in Figure 1 are terms specificto this invention.?
If the term appears in the middle of the first halfin the Jepson-like style, it can be a term specificto the domain.
For example, ?????????
(an actuator) in Figure 1 is a technical termin the domain.?
If the term is a two-kanji character and is notlisted in the ordinary dictionaries, it can be apatent jargon.Finally, by looking at the detailed description ofthe invention or related inventions, we can back upthe above inference as follows:?
The terms specific to the invention should bedescribed after the ?means to solve the prob-lem?
section in the detailed description of theinvention.?
The terms specific to the domain are widelyused in the inventions of the domain.
So, it ishighly possible that they occur frequently in therelated inventions.
We can consider the collec-tion of search result as the related inventions.?
Some of the technical terms specific to the do-main are described in the ?prior art?
section ofthe detailed description of the invention or re-lated inventions in the domain.For those technical terms specific to the domain,explanatory portions such as the following can befound: ?...????????????????????????????????????????...?(...
driving the oil pressure cylinder (or the actuator) atthe speed of ...) ?...??????????...?(...
the spout (or the orifice) ...) ?...????????????????????...?(...
blowing out ink preliminarily (namely, purging ink)...? ?...????????????????????...?(...
ink of the hot-melt type (or solid ink) ...As can be seen in the above, explanatory por-tions can be found by using cue phrases such as ???
and ??
?, ????
(?in the following?
), and ?????
(?or?
or ?namely?
).4.3 Sample ScenarioFrom the patent claim in Figure 2, we find manyterms that are candidates for explanation such as ??????
(time measurement), ????????
(themethod to measure time), ??????
(measurementresult), ???????
(sticky ink), ?????????
(removal of sticky ink), ???????????
(removal processing of sticky ink), ???????????
(the method to remove sticky ink).Among the above terms, ????????
(themethod to measure time) and ???????????
(the method to remove sticky ink) are terms spe-cific to the invention because they are judged as theelements by structure analysis.By searching the detailed description, we can findthe explanatory portion for ???????
(stickyink) as follows. ?...???????????????????????????...?(...
the ink of increased stickiness (in the following, wecall it as ?sticky ink?
...)4.4 Further Analysis and ExperimentationWe continue to analyze the NTCIR3 patent data col-lection, specifically ?Patolis Test Collection?
whichis a test collection for patent retrieval consisting ofa set of query and search result.
We use each searchresult as ?related inventions?
and analyze them tocollect cue phrases for finding explanatory portionsfor technical terms specific to the domain.5 Related WorkA NLP research for patent claim is already reportedin (Kameda, 1995).
It is directed toward dependencyanalysis of patent claims.
Although it is proposed tosupport ?analytic reading?
of patent claims, the eval-uation result for large-scale real patent data is notreported.
Our approach is different from (Kameda,1995) in that the top-level structure is analyzed.In (Sheremetyeva and Nirenburg, 1996), a re-search on a system for authoring patent claims us-ing NLP and knowledge engineering technique is re-ported.6 Concluding RemarksWe have presented a framework to represent thestructure of patent claims and a method to automat-ically analyze it.
The evaluation result suggest thatour approach is robust and practical.We are currently investigating a method to clar-ify terms in patent claims and to find the explana-tory portions from the detailed description part ofthe patent specifications.It is not only a step toward improving readability,but it can also lead to more challenging task of auto-matic patent map generation(Study group on patentmap, 1990).AcknowledgementsThe NTCIR3 patent data collection was used in our research.ReferencesLee B.
