SRA's propri-etary product, NameTag, has been reused in manyapplications in recent and ongoing efforts, includingmultilingual information retrieval and browsing, textclustering, and assistance to manual text indexing.In the following paper, we report on our experiencein embedding name recognition in these, three spe-cific applications, as well as the mutual impacts thatoccur, both on the algorithmic level and in the rolethat name recognition plays in user interaction witha system.
In the course of this, we touch upon var-ious interactions between proper name recognitionand machine translation (MT), as well as the roleof accurate name recognition in improving the per-formance of word segmentation algorithms neededfor languages uch as Japanese.
Name recognitionclearly offers added value when integrated with otheralgorithms and systems, but the latter also affectthe way in which name recognition is performed,specifically the choice of high-recall or high-precisionstrategies.
But first, we discuss the relevant featuresof NameTag.2 Descr ip t ion  o f  NameTagNameTag is a multilingual name recognition system.It finds and disambiguates in texts the names of peo-ple, organizations, and places, as well as time andnumeric expressions with very high accuracy.
Thedesign of the system makes possible the dynamicrecognition of names: NameTag does not rely onlong lists of known names.
Instead, NameTag makesuse of a flexible pattern specification language toidentify novel names that have not been encounteredpreviously.
In addition, NameTag can recognize andlink variants of names in the same document auto-matically.
For instance, it can link "IBM" to "Inter-national Business Machines" and "President Clin-ton" to "Bill Clinton.
"NameTag incorporates a language-independentC-t-+ pattern-matching engine along with thelanguage-specific lexicons, patterns, and other re-sources necessary for each language.
In addition,the Japanese, Chinese, and Thai versions integrateword segmenters to deal with the orthographic chal-lenges of these languages.
(NameTag currently hasthese language versions available plus ones for En-glish, Spanish, and French.
)NameTag is an extremely fast and robust systemthat can be easily integrated with other applicationsthrough its API.
It has been our experience thatNameTag has lent itself to so many successful inte-grations in diverse applications not just due to its ac-curacy, but to its speed.
(Its NT version is currentlybenchmarked at 300 megabytes/hour on a PentiumPro.)
It is an attractive package to embed in an ap-plication, as it does not cause significant retardationof performance.In the following discussion, we refer to variousversions of NameTag, most prominently systems forEnglish and Japanese.
Their extraction accuracyvaries.
For example, in the Sixth Message Un-derstanding Conference (MUC-6), the English sys-tern was benchmarked against he Wall Street Jour-nal blind test set for the name tagging task, andachieved a 96% F-measure, which is a combinationot" recall and precision measures.
Our internal test-ing of the Japanese system against blind test sets ofw~rious Japanese newspaper articles indicates thatit achieves from high-80 to 1ow-90% accuracy, de-pending on the types of corpora.
Indexing namesin Japanese texts is usually more challenging thanEnglish for two main reasons.
First, there is no casedistinction in .Japanese, whereas English names innewspapers are capitalized, and capitalization is avery strong clue for English name tagging.
Sec-ond, Japanese words are not separated by spaces andtherefore must be segmented into separate words be-fore the name tagging process.
As segmentation isnot 100% accurate, segmentation errors can some-times can use name tagging rules not to fire or tomisfire.3 P roper  Name Recogn i t ionIn tegrated  Wi th  a Brows ing  &Ret r ieva l  Sys temWe have recently developed a system incorporatingNarneTag that allows monolingual users to accessinformation on the World Wide Web in languagesthat they do not know (Aone, Charocopos, and Gor-linsky, 1997).
For example, previously it was noteasy for a monolingual English speaker to locate nec-essary information written in Japanese.
The userwould not know the query terms in Japanese evenif the search engine accepted Japanese queries.
Inaddition, even when the users located a possibly rel-evant text in Japanese, they would have little ideaabout what was in the text.
Output of off-the-shelfmachine translation (MT) systems are often of lowquality, and even "high-end" MT systems have prob-lems particularly in translating proper names andspecialized domain terms, which often contain themost critical information to the users.Now these users have available our multilingual(or cross-linguistic) information browsing and re-trieval system, which is aimed at monolingual userswho are interested in information from multiple lan-guage sources.
The system takes advantage of name-recognition software as embodied in NameTag to im-prove the accuracy of cross-linguistic retrieval andto provide innovative methods t.o browse and ex-plore multil ingual document collections.
The sys-tem indexes texts in different languages (currentlyEnglish and Japanese) and allows the users to re-trieve relevant texts in their native language (cur-rently English).
The retrieved text is then presentedto the users with proper names and specialized o-main terms translated and hyperlinked.
Among theinnovations in our system is the stress placed uponproper names and their role as indices for documentcontent.The system consists of an Indexing Module, aClient Module, and a Term Translation Module.The Indexing Module creates and inserts indices intoa database while the Client, Module allows browsingand retrieval of information in the database througha Web-browser-based graphical user interface ((~ IJ l).The Term Translation Module dynamically trans-lates English user queries into Japanese and the in-dexed terms in retrieved Japanese documents intoEnglish.The  Index ing  Modu leFor the present application, the system indexesnames of people, entities, and locations, as well asscientific and technical (S&T) terms in both En-glish and Japanese texts, and allows the user toquery and browse the indexed database in English.As NameTag processes texts, the indexed terms arestored in a relational database with their semantictype information (person, entity, place, S&T term)and alias information along with such meta data assource, date, language, and frequency information.The  Cl ient  Modu leThe Client Module lets the user both retrieve andbrowse information in the database through theWeb-browser-based GUI.
In the query mode, a form-based Boolean query issued by a user is automati-cally translated into an SQL query, and the Englishterms in the query are sent to the Term TranslationModule.
The Client Module then retrieves docu-ments which match either the original English queryor the translated .Japanese query.
As the indicesare names and terms which may consist of multiplewords (e.g., "Warren Christopher," memory chip"),the query terms are delimited in separate boxes inthe form, making sure no ambiguity occurs in bothtranslation and retrieval.In its browsing mode, the Client Module allowsthe user to browse the information in the databasein various ways.
For example, once the user selectsa particular document for viewing, the client sendsit to an appropriate (i.e., English or Japanese) in-dexing server for creating hyperlinks for the indexedterms, and, in the case of a Japanese document,sends the indexed terms to the Term TranslationModule to translate the Japanese terms into English.The result that the user browses is a document eachof whose indexed terms are hyperlinked to other doc-uments containing the same indexed terms.
Sincehyperlinking is based on the original or translatedEnglish terms, the monolingual English speaker canfollow the links to both English and .Japanese docu-ments transparently.
In addition, the Client Moduleis integrated with a commercial MT system for arough translation of the whole text.The Term Trans la t ion  Modu leThe Term Translation Module is used by the ClientModule bi-directionally in two different modes.That is.
it translates English query terms intoJapanese in the query mode and, in reverse, trans-lates Japanese indexed terms into English for view-ing of a retrieved Japanese text in the browsingmode.3.1 Issues Concern ing  Proper  NameRecogn i t ion  for  Brows ing  and  Ret r ieva lBased on the system description above in the pre-ceding sections, we describe in more detail in thefollowing the impacts of name recognition on multi-lingual browsing and retrieval.3.1.1 Index ing  AccuracyTo index, the system uses two different configu-rations of NameTag for English and Japanese.
In-dexing of names is particularly significant in theJapanese case, where the accuracy of indexing de-pends on the accuracy of segmentation of a sen-tence.
In English, since words are separated byspaces, there is no issue of indexing accuracy forindividual words.
However, in languages uch asJapanese, where word boundaries are not explicitlymarked by spaces, word segmentation is necessaryto index terms.
However, most segmentation algo-rithms are more likely to make errors on names, asthese are less likely to be in the lexicons.
Thus, useof name indexing can improve overall segmentationand indexing accuracy.3.1.2 Query  D isambiguat ionAs described above, the Indexing Module not onlyidentifies names of people, entities and locations, butalso disambiguates types among themselves and be-tween names and non-names.
Thus, if the user issearching for documents with the location "Wash-ington" (not a person or company named "Wash-ington") or a person "Clinton" (not a location), thesystem allows the user to specify, through the GUI,the type of each query term.
This ability to dis-ambiguate types of queries not only constrains thesearch and hence improves retrieval precision, butalso speeds up the search time considerably, espe-cially when the size of the database is very large.3.1.3 T rans la t ion  D isambiguat ionIn developing this system, we have intention-ally avoided an approach where we first translateforeign-language documents into English and indexthe translated English texts (Fluhr, 1995; Kay, 1995;Oard and Doff, 1996).
In (Aone et al, 1994), wehave shown that, in an application of extracting in-formation from foreign language texts and present-ing the results in English, the "MT first, InformationExtraction second" approach was less accurate thanthe approach in the reverse order, i.e., "InformationExtraction first.
MT second."
In particular, transla-tion quality of names by even the best NIT systemswas poor.
In an indexing and retrieval applicationsuch as the one under discussion, the proper identi-fication and translation of names are critical.There are two cases where an MT system fails totranslate names.
First, it fails to recognize wherea name starts and ends in a text string.
This is anon-trivial problem in languages uch as Japanesewhere words are not segmented by spaces and thereis no capitalization convention.
Often, an MT sys-tem "chops up" names into words and translateseach word individually.
For example, among theerrors we have encountered, an MT system failedto recognize a person name "Mori Hanae" in kanjicharacters, segmented it into three words "mori,""hana," and "e" and translated them into "forest,""England," and "blessing," respectively.Another common MT system error is where thesystem fails to make a distinction between namesand non-names.
This distinction is very importantin getting correct translations as names are usu-ally translated very differently from non-names.
Forexample, a person named "Dole" in katakana wastranslated into a common noun "doll."
Abbreviatedcountry names for Japan and the United States insingle kanji characters, which often occurs in news-papers, were sometimes translated by an MT systeminto their literal kanji meanings, "day" and "rice,"respectively.The proper name recognition capability pro-vided by NameTag solves both of these problems.NameTag's ability to identify names prevents chop-ping names into pieces.
NarneTag's ability to assignsemantic types to names makes possible greater pre-cision in translating names.4 P roper  Name Recogn i t ionIn tegrated  w i th  Text  C lus ter ingMultimedia Fusion (MMF) is a system SRA devel-oped to provide a tool to help people deal with largeincoming streams of multimedia data (Aone, Ben-nett, and Gorlinsky, 1996).
MMF clusters textsautomatically into a hierarchical concept ree, and,unlike a typical message routing system, the usersdo not need to specify beforehand what topics thatthe incoming texts cluster into.
It employs Cobweb-based conceptual clustering (Fisher, 1987), with thefeature vectors required for that algorithm suppliedby keywords picked from the body of a text basedupon their worth as determined by the Inverse Doc-ument Frequency (IDF) metric (Church and Gale,1995).
In addition, NameTag is run over the incom-ing texts (CNN closed-captions and ClariNet newsfeeds) to identify the proper names in the document(persons.
companies, locations).One of the novel features in this system wasthe important role of proper name recognition.
Itis important to recognize that using white-space-delimited tokens in a text as keywords provides ig-nificantly less information than is actually available.The proper name information (for persons, organiza-tions, and locations) adds considerable informationto what otherwise would be a meaningless string oftokens.4.1 I ssues  Concern ing  Proper  NameRecogn i t ion  for  Text  C lus ter ing4.1.1 P roper  Names  as Keywords  forC lus ters  of  TextsProper names are natural keywords to char-acterize the contents of text clusters.
Withoutproper name recognition, "International BusinessMachines" is just a string containing three com-mon nouns that may or may not be informative key-words.
Recognizing it as a proper name enlarges theset of possible keywords for the document.
Second,proper name recognition allows the disambiguationof names from non-names, such as "white" in "whiteshirt" vs. "Bob White," which enhances the accu-racy of keyword selection.The alias forms generated by NameTag are also ofgreat value to IDF calculations, since we can selectone of the name forms of a particular entity occur-ring within a document ("President Clinton," "BillClinton," "Clinton") to be the canonical form forall the name forms.
This reduces the chances thatalternate forms of the same name will be used asdistinct keywords for the same document.As discussed in (Aone, Bennett, and Gorlinsky,1996), we quantitatively evaluated the accuracy ofclustering, and the use of proper name recognitionenhanced the F-measure (a combined measure of re-call and precision) from 50% to 61% in clustering inClariNet news feed.4.1.2 Ta i lo r ing  of  NameTag to C lus ter ingThe name recognition technology embodied inNameTag had to be customized for MMF, particu-larly for the closed-caption texts from CNN HeadlineNews.
It had to handle all upper-case closed captiontexts, which pose some challenges due to the absenceof case information.
In general, lexical informationhas to be available for name recognition, in upper-case text, which tends to have a retarding effect onsystem performance.
In addition, since the closedcaptions are transcriptions of speech by anchor per-sons or reporters, characteristics of spoken languagehad to be accommodated (e.g., "OK" is Oklahomain a text while it is an answer in a caption).4.1.3 H igh  Prec i s ion  vs. H igh  Reca l l  NameRecogn i t ionThe proper name recognition used in MMF has tobe highly accurate.
In name recognition, as in otherareas of language technology, there is a trade-off be-tween recall and precision.
In applications uch astext clustering, high precision is preferred over highrecall so that the system does not introduce rrors inkeyword selection.
That is, not recognizing "'BILLCLINTON" is more acceptable than mis-recognizing"BILL FOLDER" as a person name.To handle this, NameTag provides three settings,depending on what kind of application it is beingused for: "High Precision," "High Accuracy," and"Normal."
The first, setting ensures that.
all namesidentified are correct, even at the expense of somepossibly missed ones.
The second setting focuses onidentifying all possible names within a document.,even at the cost of some false positives.
The thirdsetting is a balanced one, aiming at achieving thehighest possible combined scores.
For MMF, weused the "High Precision" setting to optimize theCobweb clustering performance.5 P roper  Name Recogn i t ionIn tegrated  w i th  Manua l  TextIndex ingSRA recently developed an an operational indexingsystem, the Human Indexing Assistant (HIA), whichassists the human indexing of an incoming flow ofdocuments.
The task involves human indexers whoprocess a large incoming stream of documents andfill out a template with names of products and equip-ment, as well as companies and individuals involvedin the manufacture of those items.
Integral to it isthe use of NameTag.HIA's GUI presents the user with three screens,the first containing the original document o be in-dexed, the second the template to be filled out, andthe third used for iconic representations of the in-dexed material.
This third screen serves as a work-ing area where the user, having filled out a templatefor a name to be indexed, can iconify it, place it inthe third screen and make links between it and othericonified objects such as company names.
As partof the indexing process, NameTag is first launchedfrom the indexing interface, and it highlights in thefirst screen the proper names in the document obe indexed.
The indexer can then select what theythink is appropriate to index and paste the namesinto templates in the second screen.5.1 Issues Concern ing  Proper  NameRecogn i t ion  for Manua l  Text  Index ingFor this application, we used the "high recall" set-ting of NameTag, as discussed in Section 4.1.3.
Itwas important hat as many potential names as pos-sible be identified.
It is a part of the indexers'job that no names be missed during indexing.
In-serting NameTag into the process required that itgain the indexers' confidence that it could indeedhit all possible names.
The indexers were not par-ticularly concerned with misidentification of names,as these could be quickly passed over by the human4(e.g., "BILL FOLDER" as a personal name in allupper-case text).
Once the users had confidence inNameTag, it was possible for them to stop readingdocuments in toto, thus producing reat increases inthe throughput of the operation.As a side issue in this sort of application, it shouldbe pointed out that information on quality of theindexing when done without automated or semi-automated help is rarely available or reliable.
Theusers impose requirements that they themselves maynot meet consistently ("whatever you do, your sys-tem can't miss any names"), and the developersmust work within what may be a more or less fic-tional framework.
However, dealing with issues ofthis kind is critical to success.
Successful insertionof HIA into the workplace involved getting the in-dexers to buy into its value for them.
Ultimately, thedeciding factor was the clearly faster ate of indexingwith the system than with the line-editing-oriented,totally manual system being replaced.6 Conc lus ionWe have discussed three diverse applications inwhich proper name recognition as embodied inNameTag has played an important role.
Clearly, theidentification ofnames can improve the performanceof other algorithms and systems.
In return, the na-ture of the application in which name recognitionis being used affects whether the name recognitionshould aim at high coverage or high accuracy.Fisher, Douglas H. 1987.
