S igna l l ing  the In terpretat ion  o f  Ind i rec t  Speech ActsPh i l ip  R. CohenCenter fo r  the Study o f  ReadingUn ivers i ty  o f  I l l i no i s ,  &Bo l t ,  Beranek and Newman, Inc.Cambridge, Mass.This panel was asked to cons ider  how var ious  "prob lemcontexts"  (e .g .
,  cooperat ive ly  assembling a pump, orSocrat i ca l ly  teaching law) in f luence  the use o f  language.As a s tar t ing  po in t ,  I sha l l  regard the problem contextas es tab l i sh ing  a set  o f  expectat ions  and assumptionsabout the shared be l ie fs ,  goa ls ,  and soc ia l  ro les  o fthose par t i c ipants .
Just  how people negot ia te  that  theyare in a g iven problem context  and what they know aboutthose contexts  are in teres t ing  quest ions ,  but  not  ones Isha l l  address here.
Rather,  I sha l l  out l ine  a theory  o flanguage use that  is sens i t ive  ?o those be l ie fs ,  goa ls ,and expectat ions .The theory is being app l ied  to character i ze  actua ld ia logues occur r ing  in the Fami l ia r  task -or lented  s l t -uat ion  ~O.1, in which an exper t  ins t ructs  a novice Co dosomething, in our case to assemble a toy water  pump.
Insuch c i rcumstances,  the d ia logue  par t i c ipants  can beviewed as per forming speech acts  p lanned,  p r lmar l \ ]y ,  toachieve goals set  by the task.
Other contexts  undoubted-ly emphasize the ins t rumenta l  uses o f  language (e .g .
,~)but  those problem contexts  w i l l  not  be cons idered here.The app l i ca t ion  o f  a model o f  speech act  use to actua ld ia logue st resses  the need For sources of  ev idence tosubstant ia te  pred ic t ions .
The purpose of  th i s  paper isto po in t  to one such source - -  speaker - re ference  ~9\] -The natura l  cand idate  fo r  a theory  o f  ins t rumenta l  useo f  speech acts is an account o f  ra t iona l  ac t ion  ~ - -what is typ ica l ly  termed "p lann ing" .
However, cont raryto the assumption of  most p lann ing systems, we are in -te res ted  in the p lann ing  o f  (usua l ly )  cooperat ive  agentswho at tempt  to recognize and fac i l i ta te  the plans o fthe i r  par tners  ~,h ,5 , \ ]6 ,20 \ ] .
Such he lp fu l  behav ior  isindependent of  the use of  language, but  is the source o fmuch conversational coherence.A plan based theory  o f  speech acts spec i f ies  that  planrecogn i t ion  is the basis  fo r  in fe r r ing  the i l l ocuC ionaryfo rce(s )  o f  an ut terance .
The goal o f  such a theory  isto fo rmal i ze  the set  o f  poss ib le  plans under ly ing  the useof  par t i cu la r  speech acts  Co achieve a g iven  set  o f  goa ls .In l ight  o f  the independent mot ivat ion  fo r  p lan generat ionand recogn i t ion ,  such a Formalism should t reat  commun-i ca t ive  and non-communlcat lve acts un i fo rmly ,  by s ta t ingthe communicative nature  o f  an i l l ocut lonary  act  as par to f  chat ac t ' s  de f in i t ion .
A reasoning system, be i thuman or  computer,  would then not  have to employ spec ia lknowledge about communicative ac ts ;  i t  would s imply  a t -tempt Co achieve or  recognize goa ls .The components o f  speech act  p \ ]ann lng and recogn i t ionsystems developed so fa r  inc lude:  a Formal language fo rdescr ib ing  mental s ta tes  and s ta tes  o f  the phys ica l  andsoc ia l  wor lds ,  operators  fo r  descr ib ing  changes o f  s ta te ,assoc ia t ions  o f  u t te rance  features  (e .g .
,  mood) w i th  cer -ta ln  operators ,  and a set  of  p lan const ruct ion  and re-cogn i t ion  in ferences .
I l l ocut ionar 'y  acts are def ined  asoperators  that  p r imar i ly  a f fec t  the mental s ta tes  o fspeakers and hearers L3 ,8 ,13 , I7 J .To be more spec i f i c ,  in the most fu l l y  developed at -tempt at  such a theory ,  Per rau lc  and A l len  ~ show howplan recogn i t ion  can "reason out"  a c lass o f  ind i rec tspeech acts .
Br ie f ly ,  they def ine  "sur face  =' speech actoperators ,  which depend on an ut terance 's  mood, and op-e ra tors  For i l l ocut ionary  acts such as request ing .
Planrecogn i t ion  invo lves  in ferences o f  the form " the  agentintended to perform act ion  X because he intended to ach-ieve i t s  e f fec t  in o rder  to enable him to do some otherac t ion  Y".
Such in ferences  are app l ied  to sur face speechact  operators  (character i z ing ,  fo r  ins tance ,  " I s  the sa l tnear you?")
to y ie ld  i i l ocut ionary  operators  such as* For th i s  b r ie f  paper,  I sha l l  have Co cur ta i l  d i scuss ionof  the p lann ing /p lan  recogn i t ion  l i te ra ture .requests to pass the salt.The remainder of this paper attempts to i l lustrate thekinds of predictlons made by the theory,.and the use ofanaphora to support one such prediction."
Consider thefollowing dialogue fragment (transmitted over teletype)in the water pump context described earl ier:Expert: l ) .
'~e need a clear bent tube For the bottomhole.
"Novice: 2).
"OK, i t ' s  done.
"Expert: 3).
"OK, now, start pumping"The example is constructed to i l lustrate my point, but i tdoes not "feel" a r t i f i c ia l .
Experiments we are conductingshow analogous phenomena in telephone and teletype modes.The theory predicts two inference paths For utteranceI -- "helpful" and "intended".
In the Former case, thenovice observes the surface-lnform speech act indicatedby a declarative utterance, and interprets i t  simply asan inform act that communicates a jo int  need.
Then, be-cause the novice is helpful, she continues to recognizethe plan behind the expert's utterance and attempts tofurther i t  by performing the action of putting the spoutover the hole.
The novice, therefore, is acting on herown, evaluating the reasonableness of the plan inferredfor the expert using private beliefs about the expert'sbeliefs and intentions.
Alternatively, she could inferthat the expert intended for i t  to be mutually believedthat he intended her to put on the tube.
Thus, the novicewould be acting because she thinks the expert intendedfor her ?o do so.
Later, she could summarize the expert'sutterance and intentions as a request ~7\].
Perrault andAlien supply heuristics that would predlct-~" the preferredinference route to be the "intended" path since i t  ismutually believed that putting the tube on is the relev-ant act ,  and h is  in tend ing  that  she per form pump-re latedacts is an expected goal in th i s  problem context .
To usePer rau l t  and A l ien 's  model For ana lyz ing  conversat ion ,such pred ic t ions  must be va l idated  aga ins t  ev idence o fthe nov ice 's  in terpretat ion  o f  the exper t ' s  in tent .Signalling Interpretation of IntentFor th i s  problem context  and communication moda l i ty ,the novice and exper t  shared knowledge that  the exoer tw i l l  a t tempt  to get the nov ice  to achieve each subgoalo f  the phys ica l  task ,  and the nov ice  must ind icate  suc-cess fu l  complet ion o f  those subtasks .
However, not a l lcommunicative acts ach iev ing  the goal o f  ind icat ing  suc-cess fu l  complet ion prov ide  ev idence o f  the nov ice 's  in -te rpretat ion  o f  in tent .
For ins tance ,  the novlce mightsay " I ' ve  put the bent tube on" s imply  to keep the exper tinformed o f  the s i tuat lon .
Such an in format ive  act  couldar i se  i f  the problem context  and pr io r  conversat ion  d ldnot make the sa l ience  o f  put t ing  the tube on mutua l lyknown.
To supply ev idence o f  the nov ice 's  in terpretat ionof intent, her response must pragmatically presupposethat interpretation.In our example, the novice has used " i t "  to refer tothe action she has performed.
I t  has been proposed thatdefinite and pronomlnal/pro-verbal reference requiresmutual belief chat the object in question_ --is in FocusO0,,s\] and satisfies the "descr ip t ,on ' l  t6,l  .
Assumingthat the,_inferring of mutually believed goals places themin focusU~ , the shared knowledge needed to refer using" i t "  is supplied by only one of the above interpretations-- the one summarizable as an indirect request.Robinson ~!~ has identified this problem of referenceto ac t ions  and has implemented a system to reso lve  them.In chls paper,  I s t ress  the importance o f  that  work totheor ies  o f  speech act  use.29Other s ignals o f  the in terpretat ion  of  intent  need tobe ident i f ied  to expla in how the exper t i s  "OK, now s tar tpumping" communicates that he thinks she has in ter -preted him cor rect ly  - -  mutual s igna l l ing  of  intentand i ts  in terpretat ion  is central  to conversat ionalSuccess.A formal theory that could capture the be l ie f ,  in-tent ion,  and focus condit ions fo r  speaker-reference isthus c lear ly  needed to va l idate  models of  speech act use.A plan-based theory might accomodate such an analys is  viaa decomposition of  cur rent ly  p r imi t ive  surface speechacts to include reference acts \[2,18J.
By planning re f -erence acts to fac i l i ta te  the hearers'  plans (of .
~43),a system could perhaps also answer questions coopera-t i ve ly  without resort ing to Gricean maxims or "roomtheor ies"  \[19.~.I have given a bare bones out l ine  of  how a descr ip-t ion of  speaker-reference can ser~e as a source of em-p i r i ca l  support to a theory of  speech acts.
However,much more research must take place to f lesh out thetheoret ica l  connections.
I have also de l iberate ly  av-oided problems o f  computation here, but hope the panelw i l l  discuss these issues, espec ia l l y  the u t i l i ty  o fcomputational mode is to ethnographers of  conversat ion.Acknowledgements:I would l l ke  to thank Chip Bruce, Scott Fer t ig ,  andSharon 0v la t t  for comments on an ear l ie r  d ra f t .References:1.
