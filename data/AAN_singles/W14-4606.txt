Proceedings of the First Celtic Language Technology Workshop, pages 41?49,Dublin, Ireland, August 23 2014.Cross-lingual Transfer Parsing for Low-Resourced Languages: An IrishCase StudyTeresa Lynn1,2, Jennifer Foster1, Mark Dras2and Lamia Tounsi11CNGL, School of Computing, Dublin City University, Ireland2Department of Computing, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia1{tlynn,jfoster,ltounsi}@computing.dcu.ie2{teresa.lynn,mark.dras}@mq.edu.auAbstractWe present a study of cross-lingual direct transfer parsing for the Irish language.
Firstly wediscuss mapping of the annotation scheme of the Irish Dependency Treebank to a universal de-pendency scheme.
We explain our dependency label mapping choices and the structural changesrequired in the Irish Dependency Treebank.
We then experiment with the universally annotatedtreebanks of ten languages from four language family groups to assess which languages are themost useful for cross-lingual parsing of Irish by using these treebanks to train delexicalised pars-ing models which are then applied to sentences from the Irish Dependency Treebank.
The bestresults are achieved when using Indonesian, a language from the Austronesian language family.1 IntroductionConsiderable efforts have been made over the past decade to develop natural language processing re-sources for the Irish language (U??
Dhonnchadha et al., 2003; U??
Dhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006;U??
Dhonnchadha, 2009; Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b; Lynn et al., 2013).
One such resourceis the Irish Dependency Treebank (Lynn et al., 2012a) which contains just over 1000 gold standard de-pendency parse trees.
These trees are labelled with deep syntactic information, marking grammaticalroles such as subject, object, modifier, and coordinator.
While a valuable resource, the treebank does notcompare in size to similar resources of other languages.1The small size of the treebank affects the accu-racy of any statistical parsing models learned from this treebank.
Therefore, we would like to investigatewhether training data from other languages can be successfully utilised to improve Irish parsing.Cross-lingual transfer parsing involves training a parser on one language, and parsing data of anotherlanguage.
McDonald et al.
(2011) describe two types of cross-lingual parsing, direct transfer parsing inwhich a delexicalised version of the source language treebank is used to train a parsing model whichis then used to parse the target language, and a more complicated projected transfer approach in whichthe direct transfer approach is used to seed a parsing model which is then trained to obey source-targetconstraints learned from a parallel corpus.
These experiments revealed that languages that were typo-logically similar were not necessarily the best source-target pairs, sometimes due to variations betweentheir language-specific annotation schemes.
In more recent work, however, McDonald et al.
(2013) re-ported improved results on cross-lingual direct transfer parsing using a universal annotation scheme, towhich six chosen treebanks are mapped for uniformity purposes.
Underlying the experiments with thisnew annotation scheme is the universal part-of-speech (POS) tagset designed by Petrov et al.
(2012).While their results confirm that parsers trained on data from languages in the same language group (e.g.Romance and Germanic) show the most accurate results, they also show that training data taken acrosslanguage-groups also produces promising results.
We attempt to apply the direct transfer approach withIrish as the target language.The Irish language belongs to the Celtic branch of the Indo-European language family.
The naturalfirst step in cross-lingual parsing for Irish would be to look to those languages of the Celtic languageThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

Welsh, Scots Gaelic, Manx, Breton and Cornish, as a source of training data.
However,these languages are just as, if not further, under-resourced.
Thus, we attempt to use the languages of theuniversal dependency treebanks (McDonald et al., 2013).The paper is organised as follows.
In Section 2, we give an overview of the status of the Irish lan-guage and the Irish Dependency Treebank.
Section 3 describes the mapping of the Irish DependencyTreebank?s POS tagset (U??
Dhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006) to that of Petrov et al.
(2012), andthe Irish Dependency Treebank annotation scheme (Lynn et al.
(2012b)) to the Universal DependencyScheme.
Following that, in Section 4 we carry out cross-lingual direct transfer parsing experiments withten harmonised treebanks to assess whether any of these languages are suitable for such parsing transferfor Irish.
Section 5 summarises our work.2 Irish Language and TreebankIrish, a minority EU language, is the national and official language of Ireland.
Despite this status, Irishis only spoken on a daily basis by a minority.
As a Celtic language, Irish shares specific linguisticfeatures with other Celtic languages, such as a VSO (verb-subject-object) word order and interestingmorphological features such as inflected prepositions and initial mutations, for example.Compared to other EU-official languages, Irish language technology is under-resourced, as highlightedby a recent study (Judge et al., 2012).
In the area of morpho-syntactic processing, recent years have seenthe development of a part-of-speech tagger (U??
Dhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006), a morphologicalanalyser (U??
Dhonnchadha et al., 2003), a shallow chunker (U??
Dhonnchadha, 2009), a dependency tree-bank (Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b) and statistical dependency parsing models for MaltParser(Nivre et al., 2006) and Mate parser (Bohnet, 2010) trained on this treebank (Lynn et al., 2013).The annotation scheme for the Irish Dependency Treebank (Lynn et al., 2012b) was inspired by LexicalFunctional Grammar (Bresnan, 2001) and has its roots in the dependency annotation scheme describedby C?etino?glu et al.
(2010).
It was extended and adapted to suit the linguistic characterisics of the Irishlanguage.
The final label set consists of 47 dependency labels, defining grammatical and functionalrelations between the words in a sentence.
The label set is hierarchical in nature with labels such asvparticle (verb particle) and vocparticle (vocative particle), for example, representing morefine-grained versions of the particle label.3 A universal dependency scheme for the Irish Dependency TreebankIn this section, we describe how a ?universal?
version of the Irish Dependency Treebank was created bymapping the original POS tags to universal POS tags and mapping the original dependency scheme to theuniversal dependency scheme.
The result of this effort is an alternative version of the Irish DependencyTreebank which will be made available to the research community along with the original.3.1 Mapping the Irish POS tagset to the Universal POS tagsetThe Universal POS tagset (Petrov et al., 2012) has been designed to facilitate unsupervised and cross-lingual part-of-speech tagging and parsing research, by simplifying POS tagsets and unifying them acrosslanguages.
The Irish Dependency Treebank was built upon a POS-tagged corpus developed by U??
Dhon-nchadha and van Genabith (2006).
The treebank?s tagset contains both coarse- and fine-grained POS tagswhich we map to the Universal POS tags (e.g.
Prop Noun?
NOUN).
Table 1 shows the mappings.Most of the POS mappings made from the Irish POS tagset to the universal tagset are intuitive.
How-ever, some decisions require explanation.Cop ?
VERB There are two verbs ?to be?
in Irish: the substantive verb b??
and the copula is.
Forthat reason, the Irish POS tagset differentiates the copula by using the POS tag Cop.
In Irish syntaxliterature, there is some discussion over its syntactic role, whether it is a verb or a linking particle.
Therole normally played is that of a linking element between a subject and a predicate.
However, Lynn et al.
(2012a)?s syntactic analysis of the copula is in line with that of Stenson (1981), regarding it as a verb.
Inaddition, because the copula is often labelled in the Irish annotation scheme as the syntactic head of thematrix clause, we have chosen VERB as the most suitable mapping for this part of speech.42Part-of-speech (POS) mappingsUniversal Irish Universal IrishNOUNNoun Noun, Pron Ref,Subst Subst, Verbal Noun,Prop NounADPPrep Deg, Prep Det, Prep Pron,Prep Simp, Prep Poss,Prep CmpdNoGen, Prep Cmpd,Prep Art, Pron PrepPRONPron Pers, Pron Idf, Pron Q,Pron DemADVAdv Temp, Adv Loc, Adv Dir,Adv Q, Adv Its, Adv GnVERBCop Cop, Verb PastInd, Verb PresInd,Verb PresImp, Verb VI, Verb VT,Verb VTI, Verb PastImp, Verb Cond,Verb FutInd, Verb VD, Verb ImperPRTPart Vb, Part Sup, Part Inf, Part Pat,Part Voc, Part Ad, Part Deg, Part Comp,Part Rel, Part Num, Part Cp,DET Art Art, Det Det NUM Num NumADJ Prop Adj, Verbal Adj, Adj Adj XItem Item, Abr Abr, CM CM, CU CU,CC CC, Unknown Unknown,Guess Abr, Itj Itj, Foreign Foreign,CONJ Conj Coord, Conj Subord .

Punct PunctTable 1: Mapping of Irish Coarse and Fine-grained POS pairs (coarse fine) to Universal POS tagset.Pron Prep?ADP Pron Prep is the Irish POS tag for pronominal prepositions, which are also referredto as prepositional pronouns.
Characteristic of Celtic languages, they are prepositions inflected with theirpronominal objects ?
compare, for example, le mo chara ?with my friend?
with leis ?with him?.
Whilethe Irish POS labelling scheme labels them as pronouns in the first instance, our dependency labellingscheme treats the relationship between them and their syntactic heads as obl (obliques) or padjunct(prepositional adjuncts).
Therefore, we map them to ADP (adpositions).3.2 Mapping the Irish Dependency Scheme to the Universal Dependency SchemeThe departure point for the design of the Universal Dependency Annotation Scheme (McDonald etal., 2013) was the Stanford typed dependency scheme (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), which wasadapted based on a cross-lingual analysis of six languages: English, French, German, Korean, Spanishand Swedish.
Existing English and Swedish treebanks were automatically mapped to the new universalscheme.
The rest of the treebanks were developed manually to ensure consistency in annotation.
Thestudy also reports some structural changes (e.g.
Swedish treebank coordination structures).2There are 41 dependency relation labels to choose from in the universal annotation scheme3.
McDon-ald et al.
(2013) use all labels in the annotation of the German and English treebanks.
The remaininglanguages use varying subsets of the label set.
In our study we map the Irish dependency annotationscheme to 30 of the universal labels.
The mappings are given in Table 2.As with the POS mapping discussed in Section 3.1, mapping the Irish dependency scheme to theuniversal scheme was relatively straightforward, due in part, perhaps, to a similar level of granularitysuggested by the similar label set sizes (Irish 47; standard universal 41).
That said, there were significantconsiderations made in the mapping process, which involved some structural change in the treebank andthe introduction of more specific analyses in the labelling scheme.
These are discussed below.3.2.1 Structural DifferencesThe following structural changes were made manually before the dependency labels were mapped to theuniversal scheme.coordination The most significant structural change made to the treebank was an adjustment to theanalysis of coordination.
The original Irish Dependency Treebank subscribes to the LFG coordinationanalysis, where the coordinating conjunction (e.g.
agus ?and?)
is the head, with the coordinates as itsdependents, labelled coord (see Figure 1).
The Universal Dependency Annotation scheme, on the2There are two versions of the annotation scheme: the standard version (where copulas and adpositions are syntactic heads),and the content-head version which treats content words as syntactic heads.
We are using the standard version for our study.3The vmod label is used only in the content-head version.43Dependency Label MappingsUniversal Irish Universal Irishroot top csubj csubjacomp adjpred, advpred, ppred dep foradpcomp N/A det det, det2, demadpmod padjunct, obl, obl2, obl ag dobj obj, vnobj, obj qadpobj pobj mark subadjunctadvcl N/A nmod addr, nadjunctadvmodadjunct, advadjunct, quant,advadjunct qnsubj subj, subj qamod adjadjunct num N/Aappos app p punctuationattr npred parataxis N/Aaux toinfinitive poss posscc N/A prtparticle, vparticle, nparticle, advparticle,vocparticle, particlehead, cleftparticle,qparticle, augccomp comp rcmod relmodcompmod nadjunct rel relparticleconj coord xcomp xcompTable 2: Mapping of Irish Dependency Annotation Scheme to Universal Dependency Annotation Schemeother hand, uses right-adjunction, where the first coordinate is the head of the coordination, and therest of the phrase is adjoined to the right, labelling coordinating conjunctions as cc and the followingcoordinates as conj (Figure 2).coord det subj advpred top coord det subj advpred obl det pobjBh??

mar ?because?, nuair?when?)
is a subadjunct dependent of the matrix verb, and the head of the subordinate clause is acomp dependent of the subordinating conjunction (Figure 3).
In contrast, the universal scheme is inline with the Stanford analysis of subordinate clauses, where the head of the clause is dependent on thematrix verb, and the subordinating conjunction is a dependent of the clause head (Figure 4).3.2.2 Differences between dependency typesWe found that the original Irish scheme makes distinctions that the universal scheme does not ?
thisfiner-grained information takes the form of the following Irish-specific dependency types: advpred,44top subj xcomp obl det pobj adjadjunct subadjunct comp subj ppred pobj numCaithfidh t?u brath ar na himreoir??
?aiti?ula nuair at?a t?u i Roinn 1Have-to-FUT you rely on the players local when REL-be-PRES you in Division 1?You have to rely on the local players when you are in Division 1?Figure 3: LFG-style subordinate clause analysis (with original Irish Dependency labels)top subj xcomp obl det pobj adjadjunct subadjunct comp subj ppred pobj numCaithfidh t?u brath ar na himreoir??
?aiti?ula nuair at?a t?u i Roinn 1Have-to-FUT you rely on the players local when REL-be-PRES you in Division 1?You have to rely on the local players when you are in Division 1?Figure 4: Stanford-style subordinate clause analysis (with original Irish Dependency labels)ppred, subj q, obj q, advadjunct q, obl, obl2.
In producing the universal version of the tree-bank, these Irish-specific dependency types are mapped to less informative universal ones (see Table 2).Conversely, we found that the universal scheme makes distinctions that the Irish scheme does not.
Someof these dependency types are not needed for Irish.
For example, there is no indirect object iobj in Irish,nor is there a passive construction that would require nsubjpass, csubjpass or auxpass.
Also, inthe Irish Dependency Treebank, the copula is usually the root (top) or the head of a subordinate clause(e.g.
comp) which renders the universal type cop redundant.
Others that are not used are adp, expl,infmod, mwe, neg, partmod.
However, we did identify some dependency relationships in the univer-sal scheme that we introduce to the universal Irish Dependency Treebank (adpcomp, adposition,advcl, num, parataxis).
These are explained below.comp?
adpcomp, advcl, parataxis, ccomp The following new mappings were previously subsumedby the Irish dependency label comp (complement clause).
The mapping for comp has thus been splitbetween adpcomp, advcl, parataxis and ccomp.?
adpcomp is a clausal complement of an adposition.
An example from the English data is ?someunderstanding of what the company?s long-term horizon should begin to look like?, where ?begin?,as the head of the clause, is a dependent of the preposition ?of?.
An example of how we use thislabel in Irish is: an l?
?ne l?antosach is m?o cl?u a th?ainig as Ciarra??
?o bh??
aimsir Sheehy ann ?the mostrenowned forward line to come out of Kerry since Sheehy?s time?
(lit.
?from it was Sheehy?s time?
).The verb bh??
?was?, head of the dependent clause, is an adcomp dependent of the preposition ?o.?
advcl is used to identify adverbial clause modifiers.
In the English data, they are often introducedby subordinating conjunctions such as ?when?, ?because?, ?although?, ?after?, ?however?, etc.
Anexample is ?However, because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered, ad rates will behigher?.
Here, ?lowered?
is a advcl dependent of ?will?.
An example of usage is: T?a truailli?u m?orsan ?ait mar nach bhfuil c?oras s?earachais ann ?There is a lot of pollution in the area because thereis no sewerage system?, where bhfuil ?is?
is an advcl dependent of T?a ?is?.45?
parataxis labels clausal structures that are separated from the previous clause with punctuationsuch as ?
... : () ; and so on.
Examples in Irish Is l?eir go bhfuil ag ?eir??
le feachtas an IDA ?meastar gur in?Eirinn a lonna?
?tear timpeall 30% de na hionaid ?It is clear that the IDA campaign issucceeding ?
it is believed that 30% of the centres are based in Ireland?.
Here, meastar ?is believed?is a parataxis dependent of Is ?is?.?
ccomp covers all other types of clausal complements.
For example, in English, ?Mr.
Amos says theShow-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day?.
The head of the complement clausehere is ?do?, which is a comp dependent of the matrix verb ?says?.
A similar Irish example is: D?uirtsiad nach bhfeiceann siad an cine?al seo chomh minic ?They said that they don?t see this type asoften?.
Here, bhfeiceann ?see?
is the head of the complement clause, which is a comp dependent ofthe verb D?uirt ?Said?.quant?
num, advmod The Irish Dependency Scheme uses one dependency label (quant) to coverall types of numerals and quantifiers.
We now use the universal scheme to differentiate between quanti-fiers such as m?or?an ?many?
and numerals such as fiche ?twenty?.nadjunct?
nmod, compmod The Irish dependency label nadjunct accounts for all nominal mod-ifiers.
However, in order to map to the universal scheme, we discriminate two kinds: (i) nouns that mod-ify nouns (usually genitive case in Irish) are mapped to compmod (e.g.
plean marga?
?ochta ?marketingplan?)
and (ii) nouns that modify clauses are mapped to nmod (e.g.
bliain ?o shin ?a year ago?
).4 Parsing ExperimentsWe now describe how we extend the direct transfer experiments described in McDonald et al.
(2013)to Irish.
In Section 4.1, we describe the datasets used in our experiments and explain the experimentaldesign.
In Section 4.2, we present the results, which we then discuss in Section 4.3.4.1 Data and Experimental SetupWe present the datasets used in our experiments and explain how they are used.
Irish is the targetlanguage for all our parsing experiments.Universal Irish Dependency Treebank This is the universal version of the Irish Dependency Treebankwhich contains 1020 gold-standard trees, which have been mapped to the Universal POS tagset andUniversal Dependency Annotation Scheme, as described in Section 3.
In order to establish a monolingualbaseline against which to compare our cross-lingual results, we perform a five-fold cross-validation bydividing the full data set into five non-overlapping training/test sets.
We also test our cross-lingual modelson an delexicalised version of this treebank.Transfer source training data For our direct transfer cross-lingual parsing experiments, we use 10 ofthe standard version harmonised training data sets4made available by McDonald et al.
(2013): BrazilianPortuguese (PT-BR), English (EN), French (FR), German (DE), Indonesian (ID), Italian (IT), Japanese(JA), Korean (KO), Spanish (ES) and Swedish (SV).
For the purposes of uniformity, we select the first4447 trees from each treebank ?
to match the number of trees in the smallest data set (Swedish).
Wedelexicalise all treebanks and use the universal POS tags as both the coarse- and fine-grained values.5We train a parser on all 10 source data sets outlined and use each induced parsing model to parse and teston a delexicalised version of the Universal Irish Dependency Treebank.Largest transfer source training data - Universal English Dependency Treebank English has thelargest source training data set (sections 2-21 of the Wall Street Journal data in the Penn Treebank (Mar-cus et al., 1993) contains 39, 832 trees).
As with the smaller transfer datasets, we delexicalise this datasetand use the universal POS tag values only.
We experiment with this larger training set in order to establishwhether more training data helps in a cross-lingual setting.4Version 2 data sets downloaded from https://code.google.com/p/uni-dep-tb/5Note that the downloaded treebanks had some fine-grained POS tags that were not used across all languages: e.g.
VERB-VPRT (Spanish), CD (English).46Parser and Evaluation Metrics We use a transition-based dependency parsing system, MaltParser(Nivre et al., 2006) for all of our experiments.
All our models are trained using the stacklazy algorithm,which can handle the non-projective trees present in the Irish data.
In each case we report LabelledAttachment Score (LAS) and Unlabelled Attachment Score (UAS).64.2 ResultsAll cross-lingual results are presented in Table 3.
Note that when we train and test on Irish (our mono-lingual baseline), we achieve an average accuracy of 78.54% (UAS) and 71.59% (LAS) over the fivecross-validation runs.
The cross-lingual results are substantially lower than this baseline.
The LASresults range from 0.84 (JA) to 43.88 (ID) and the UAS from 16.74 (JA) to 61.69 (ID).SingleT MultiT LargestTTraining EN FR DE ID IT JA KO PT-BR ES SV All ENUAS 51.72 56.84 49.21 61.69 50.98 16.74 18.02 57.31 57.00 49.95 57.69 51.59LAS 35.03 37.91 33.04 43.88 37.98 0.84 9.35 42.13 41.94 34.02 41.38 33.97Experiment SingleT-30 MultiT-30 LargestT-30Training EN FR DE ID IT JA KO PT-BR ES SV All ENAvg sent len 23 24 16 21 21 9 11 24 26 14 19 23UAS 55.97 60.98 53.42 64.86 54.47 16.88 19.27 60.47 60.53 54.40 61.40 55.54LAS 38.42 41.44 36.24 46.45 40.56 1.19 10.08 45.04 45.23 37.76 44.63 37.08Table 3: Multi-lingual transfer parsing resultsA closer look at the single-source transfer parsing evaluation results (SingleT) shows that some lan-guage sources are particularly strong for parsing accuracy of certain labels.
For example, ROOT (forIndonesian), adpobj (for French) and amod (for Spanish).
In response to these varied results, we ex-plore the possibility of combining the strengths of all the source languages (multi-source direct transfer(MultiT) ?
also implemented by McDonald et al.
(2011)).
A parser is trained on a concatenation ofall the delexicalised source data described in Section 4.1 and tested on the full delexicalised UniversalIrish Dependency Treebank.
Combining all source data produces parsing results of 57.69% (UAS) and41.38% (LAS), which is outperformed by the best individual source language model.Parsing with the large English training set (LargestT) yielded results of 51.59 (UAS) and 33.97 (LAS)compared to a UAS/LAS of 51.72/35.05 for the smaller English training set.
We investigated moreclosely why the larger training set did not improve performance by incrementally adding training sen-tences to the smaller set ?
none of these increments reveal any higher scores, suggesting that English isnot a suitable source training language for Irish.It is well known that sentence length has a negative effect on parsing accuracy.
As noted in earlierexperiments (Lynn et al., 2012b), the Irish Dependency Treebank contains some very long difficult-to-parse sentences (some legal text exceeds 300 tokens in length).
The average sentence length is 27 tokens.By placing a 30-token limit on the Universal Irish Dependency Treebank we are left with 778 sentences,with an average sentence length of 14.
We use this new 30-token-limit version of the Irish DependencyTreebank data to test our parsing models.
The results are shown in the lower half of Table 3.
Notsurprisingly, the results rise substantially for all models.4.3 DiscussionMcDonald et al.
(2013)?s single-source transfer parsing results show that languages within the samelanguage groups make good source-target pairs.
They also show reasonable accuracy of source-targetpairing across language groups.
For instance, the baseline when parsing French is 81.44 (UAS) and 73.37(LAS), while the transfer results obtained using an English treebank are 70.14 (UAS) and 58.20(LAS).Our baseline parser for Irish yields results of 78.54 (UAS) and 71.59 (LAS), while Indonesian-Irishtransfer results are 61.69 (UAS) and 43.88 (LAS).The lowest scoring source language is Japanese.
This parsing model?s output shows less than 3%accuracy when identifying the ROOT label.
This suggests the effect that the divergent word orders have6All scores are micro-averaged.47on this type of cross-lingual parsing ?
VSO (Irish) vs SOV (Japanese).
Another factor that is likely to beplaying a role is the size of the Japanese sentences.
The average sentence length in the Japanese trainingdata is only 9 words, which means that this dataset is comparatively smaller than the others.
It is alsoworth noting that the universal Japanese treebank uses only 15 of the 41 universal labels (the universalIrish treebank uses 30 of these labels).As our best performing model (Indonesian) is an Austronesian language, we investigate why thislanguage does better when compared to Indo-European languages.
We compare the results obtained bythe Indonesian parser with those of the English parser (SingleT).
Firstly, we note that the Indonesianparser captures nominal modification much better than English, resulting in an increased precision-recallscore of 60/67 on compmod.
This highlights that the similarities in noun-noun modification betweenIrish and Indonesian helps cross-lingual parsing.
In both languages the modifying noun directly followsthe head noun, e.g.
?the statue of the hero?
translates in Irish as dealbh an laoich (lit.
statue the hero);in Indonesian as patung palawan (lit.
statue hero).
Secondly, our analysis shows that the English parserdoes not capture long-distance dependencies as well as the Indonesian parser.
For example, we haveobserved an increased difference in precision-recall of 44%-44% on mark, 12%-17.88% on cc and4%-23.17% on rcmod when training on Indonesian.
Similar differences have also been observed whenwe compare with the French and English (LargestT) parsers.
The Irish language allows for the useof multiple conjoined structures within a sentence and it appears that long-distance dependencies canaffect cross-lingual parsing.
Indeed, excluding very long sentences from the test set reveals substantialincreases in precision-recall scores for labels such as advcl, cc, conj and ccomp ?
all of which arelabels associated with long-distance dependencies.With this study, we had hoped that we would be able to identify a way to bootstrap the developmentof the Irish Dependency Treebank and parser through the use of delexicalised treebanks annotated withthe Universal Annotation Scheme.
While the current treebank data might capture certain linguistic phe-nomena well, we expected that some cross-linguistic regularities could be taken advantage of.
Althoughthe best cross-lingual model failed to outperform the monolingual model, perhaps it might be possible tocombine the strengths of the Indonesian and Irish treebanks?
We performed 5-fold cross-validation onthe combined Indonesian and Irish data sets.
The results did not improve over the Irish model.
We thenanalysed the extent of their complementarity by counting the number of sentences where the Indonesianmodel outperformed the Irish model.
This happened in only 20 cases, suggesting that there is no benefitin using the Indonesian data over the Irish data nor in combining them at the sentence-level.5 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we have reported an implementation of cross-lingual direct transfer parsing of the Irishlanguage.
We have also presented and explained our mapping of the Irish Dependency Treebank to theUniversal POS tagset and Universal Annotation Scheme.
Our parsing results show that an Austronesianlanguage surpasses Indo-European languages as source data for cross-lingual Irish parsing.In extending this research, there are many interesting avenues which could be explored includingthe use of Irish as a source language for another Celtic language and experimenting with the projectedtransfer approach of McDonald et al.
