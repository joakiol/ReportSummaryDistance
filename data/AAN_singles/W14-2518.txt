Weshow that the task can be performed usingNLP tools and techniques.
The task is de-ployed on a large corpus of data to study aspecific phenomenon, namely the tempo-ral dimension of contemporary arts glob-alization over the first decade of the 21stcentury.1 IntroductionThis paper reports on the use of fairly simple Nat-ural Language Processing (NLP) technology as atool for social research.
We seek to understand theglobalization of contemporary art, relying on re-leases for art events worldwide over the period of1999-2012.
A first phase of the project exploitedNamed-Entity Recognition (NER) to extract citiesnamed in the corpus.In this second phase of the research, we turnour attention to a novel task: the temporal dimen-sion captured in these texts.
By identifying thetiming of geographically-cited events, we are ableto examine how the history and projected futureof the art world evolve alongside, and as a resultof, its current geographical structure.
To deter-mine whether cities named in press releases re-fer to events that occur in the past, the present,or the future, we need methods for resolving timeexpressed in text relative to the time of the re-lease of the text.
We use the Stanford TemporalTaggerSUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012), aswell as rules we have built on top of the Stanfordpart-of-speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), toidentify the temporal referent of each city men-tioned.
The two systems in combination performslightly better than either does alone, and at a highenough level of accuracy to produce meaningfuldata for network analysis.
We start by describingthe project in more detail in Section 2, as well asthe data we use in Section 3.
Section 4 discussesour method for identifying the temporal locationof named events.
The networks we build using thisdata afford some preliminary insights into the dy-namics of contemporary arts globalization, whichwe present in Section 5.
Our aim here is not, how-ever, to offer definitive conclusions about changein the art world.
Rather, we present these analysesas proof of concept to demonstrate how a novelNLP task can help advance a particular agenda insocial research.2 The Goals of the ProjectThe shifting geography of contemporary art is ofinterest to social scientists as an instance of cul-tural globalization (Bourdieu, 1999; Crane, 2008).Scholars and contemporary art practitioners alikehave remarked on changes in the geography ofglobally-significant art activity in recent decades(Vanderlinden and Filipovic, 2005; McAndrew,2008; Quemin, 2006).
Accounts of these dy-namics often converge: for example, many havepointed to the role that speculation in the art ofthe developing world plays in fragmenting theonce geographically-concentrated field of contem-porary art (e.g., (Lee, 2012; Stallabrass, 2006)).Such claims remain largely a matter of conjecture,however, having never been subjected to system-atic empirical scrutiny.Because of the difficulties of compiling appro-priate data, contemporary arts globalization hasrarely been studied using quantitative methods.The few quantitative analyses that exist focus onparticular cities (Velthius, 2013), individual artists(Buchholz, forthcoming), or a particular category66of art-related events, for example fairs (Quemin,2013).
Our project relies on NLP techniques tosolve the problems of data collection that havelimited previous research endeavors.
We extractinformation from a large and growing corpus ofpress releases for contemporary art events occur-ring worldwide.
An initial phase of the project re-vealed for the first time an object that has resistedempirical description: the contemporary global artworld.
The research was able to track changes inthe art worlds geographic structure over the periodof 2001 until 2012.
Named Entity Recognition(NER) was used to identify cities mentioned inthe body text of announcements as the location ofother significant contemporary art events.
Poolingdocuments over a given time window yielded a dy-namic network of cities, enabling the researchersto track the evolution of the art world.
The analysisrevealed that a distinct central core of cities all inEurope and North America enjoyed a remarkablystable ranking as top art locales over the period;however, as the art world expanded, connection tothese capitals became less important as an entry tothe art world for locations outside the global north(Rule and Brandt, 2013).
?The city that I believed was my past, is myfuture, my present; the years I have spent in Eu-rope are an illusion, I always was (and will be)in Buenos Aires?
(Borges, 1978).

re-marks capture a paradox about places of signifi-cance: important places are places where impor-tant things have happened and will happen?butthis is so from the viewpoint of the present, whichis always evolving.
This insight implies that inorder to understand the dynamics shaping the ge-ography of significant art activity, analysts needto disentangle the real time in which attributionsof significance to locations occur, from the rela-tive timing of the events that make them signifi-cant.
The current phase of our research attemptsto assess how the geographical evolution of theart world shapes contemporary arts history and itsprojected future.
It does so by considering howevents mentioned in the corpus are located in time,relative to the event in question.
We build upon theNER-based strategy developed in Phase 1 for iden-tifying cities as the location of important events.Here, however, we distinguish cities as the loca-tion of events in the past, present, or future.
[The artist] has exhibited extensively in group shows andbiennials across Europe, Asia and the Americas includ-ing Manifesta 8, the Third Moscow Biennale and Shar-jah Biennial.
His work is the subject of a major mono-graph, Laurent Grasso: The Black-Body Radiation (LesPresses du Reel, 2009).
As the 2008 Laureate of theMarcel Duchamp Prize, Grasso presented a special ex-hibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou (2009).
Gras-sos work is currently on view at La Maison Rouge inParis in an exhibition of the Olbricht Collection; forth-coming are solo exhibitions at the Galerie nationale duJeu de Paume, Paris in 2012 and at the Mus?ee d?art con-temporain de Montr?eal, Canada in 2013.Figure 1: A sample press release3 DataWe draw on corpus of press releases for con-temporary art events worldwide, distributed overthe premier email digest service for contemporaryart.
The digest serves a professional clientele, andsends out 3-5 press releases a day.
These emailsare free to the digest?s 90,000 subscribers (com-pare to Artforum?s circulation of 35,000).
Pressreleases are both written and paid for by the insti-tutions sponsoring the events they announce.
Thecorpus covers the years 1999 to 2012; it contains10,566 documents and 6362284.
Our automateddetection, checked by human annotators, identi-fied 1007 unique cities.We conceive of each press release as an attemptto raise the status of the event in question by men-tioning other high-status events to which it is re-lated.
Pooling the references of cities across doc-uments thus gives rise to a network, analogous toa citation network.
The press releases are ratherconventionalized, and name cities almost exclu-sively as the location of important related events.The format is not just used by this particular digestservice, but is common to the art world generally.A sample is shown in Figure 1.4 Time IdentificationCities associated with art events are identified us-ing an NER-based approach, which performs at anf-measure of 64.5 and which we do not further de-scribe in this paper.
We use two approaches fortemporal resolution to assess whether the citiesmentioned are the locations of events that hap-pened in the past, are currently happening, or ex-pected to happen in the future.The first approach analyzes explicit time ex-67AccuracyPast Current FutureP R F1 P R F1 P R F1Baseline?63.8 0 0 0 63.8 100 77.9 0 0 0Lexical (L) 66.6 79.3 56.6 66.1 75.3 75.5 75.4 21.6 36.5 27.1Grammaticized (G) 73.4 70.0 48.8 57.5 74.9 89.0 81.4 64.5 38.5 48.2LG69.2 77.2 73.6 75.4 81.2 71.8 76.2 23.2 42.3 29.9GL74.0 71.0 51.2 59.5 75.5 89.0 81.7 64.5 38.5 48.2LG& GL78.0 70.5 76.0 73.1 82.2 85.6 83.9 65.5 36.5 46.9Table 1: Accuracy and precision, recall and F-measure for past, current and future events.
?Baseline:Tagging all events as current.pressions in dates, time durations, holidays, etc.The second approach uses verbal tense to resolvegrammaticized reference to time.
In both ap-proaches: (1) We use distance within a sentenceas a heuristic to associate a temporal expressionto a city.
(2) Cities associated with art events aretagged as past, current or future, where currentis the default tag.
This section describes both ap-proaches and how they can be combined to en-hance the performance.4.1 Explicit Lexical Temporal ExpressionsExplicit temporal expressions could be partial orcomplete dates (Jan-01, March 2nd, 2014), spe-cific named days (Christmas 2001), deictic timeexpressions (last Wednesday), time durations (thepast five years), seasons (next fall), etc.We use the Stanford Temporal Tagger, SUTime(Chang and Manning, 2012) to detect and evaluateTemporal expressions relative to the publicationdate of the press release.
Temporal expressionsthat evaluate to incomplete dates take on the miss-ing date components from the publication date.
Ifthe temporal expression resolves to a date before,same as or after the publication date, then the eventassociated with the city is tagged as past, current,or future event respectively.
Cities that are notassociated with explicit temporal expressions aregiven the default tag: current.4.2 Grammaticized Temporal ExpressionsTense is grammaticalization of location in time(Comrie, 1985).
Our tense-based approach hastwo steps.
First, the Stanford part-of-speech tag-ger (Toutanova et al., 2003) is used to identify thePOS tags of all tokens in the documents.
Second,we use hand-written rules to identify the tempo-ral interpretation of every event.
The rules aremostly based on the POS tags of verbs; we usethe tag sets from the Penn Treebank Project (Mar-cus et al., 1993).
We use only the verbal tags:VB (Verb, base form), VBD (Verb, past tense),VBG (Verb, gerund or present participle), etc.
andMD (Modal).
Here are some examples of therules; events associated with: (1) VBP or VBZ aretagged as current.
(2) VBD are tagged as past.
(3)VB that are preceded by will/MD are tagged as fu-ture.4.3 Results and Combining of the TwoApproachesDuring development, we found that the two timetagging approaches perform well in different situ-ations.
For example, the lexical approach has thehigher recall (66.1%) for past event as writers of-ten mention the exact date of past events.
How-ever, in the case of current events dates are seldommentioned, the present tense is enough to com-municate that the event mentioned in a sentenceis ongoing.
This accounts for the higher recall ofthe grammaticized (89%) as against the lexical ap-proach (75.5%) for current events.
If we do not as-sign current by default to the failed cases in boththe lexical and grammaticized approaches, the re-call for current events drops drastically for the lex-ical approach (75.5% ?
0.69%) compared to thegrammaticized approaches (89% ?
81.5%).Combining the two approaches improves theperformance of the time tagging task.
We startwith one approach to tag an event and whenthat approach fails (does not provide an answer),the other approach kicks in.
If both approachesfail, the event is tagged by default as current.For example, in approach GrammaticizedLexical(GL), when the Grammaticized approach failsto tag an event, the Lexical approach is used.The best combination is achieved by running theLexicalGrammaticized(LG) first; if the output tag68is past, accept its answer; otherwise run theGrammaticizedLexicalsystem (GL) and accept itsverdict.
If GLhas no answer, choose present.
Theaccuracy of this approach is 78.0%.

?Share?refers to the percentage of events in relative timeduring a given period.5 Creation and Interpretation ofNetworksTo analyze the geography of the art world, wegenerated networks of events in relative time overthree four-year periods: 2001-2004; 2005-2008;and 2009-2012.
Nodes represent cities named asthe location of art events, and edges co-citationsfrom a particular geographical and temporal stand-point.
Specifically, we attribute ties between citiesof the past, present or future of a given periodwhen they are mentioned together in press releasesfor events currently occurring in the same city.Ties are weighted to reflect the number of co-mentions.
For example, if Basel is noted twice asa future event location by press releases for eventsin New York, and LA is mentioned by New Yorkpress releases three times, the edge between Baseland LA receives an edge weight of 2, reflecting thenumber of shared mentions.Basic properties of the nine resulting networksare displayed in table 2.
Notice the marked differ-ence in the distribution of events in relative timebetween 2005-2008 and 2009-2012.
Cities men-tioned in connection with events in both the futureand the past figure as a greater proportion of thetotal in the last, as compared to the middle period.Though we consider the possibility that this is anartifact of the data, it seems more to likely thatthe shift reflects the impact of a real world devel-opment: namely, the global economic recession,which began in 2008 and had profound effect onfunding for contemporary art.
In the context ofthe economic contraction, it seems that both con-temporary arts future and its history become moreimportant relative to its present.CairoMilanFrankfurtChicagoLisbonNew.YorkAmsterdamBeijingBerlinVeniceLondon ViennaZurichIstanbulHamburgBrusselsStockholmMoscowWarsawBaselRotterdamParisBeirutLos.AngelesTorontoSan.FranciscoFigure 2: Future of the global contemporary artworld, 2009-2012Figure 2 shows the network of future eventsarising from 2009-2012.
Recall that the graphcaptures the world?s future, as it is structured bythe geography of significant art world activity dur-ing this period.
Just as in Borges remarks aboutBuenos Aires, we observe here how importantplaces in the art worlds present shape the map ofits future.This graph suggests an art world that is ratherconservative, more so, at least, than accounts ofthe speculation driving its globalization would im-ply.
The network exhibits a classic core-peripherystructure; the cities at its center are the ?big?
artcapitals of the global north: London, New York,Berlin, Paris, Venice.
In other words, the com-mon proposition that the ?hype?
around emergingart markets has de-centered the contemporary artworld is not borne out by a close empirical exami-nation from the perspective of the hype-generatorsthemselves.
Rather, it would seems that the roleof these cities as the prime location for contem-porary art in the present enables them to projectthemselves as the location of significant art activ-ity in the future.69ReferencesJorge Luis Borges.
