The general research directions of thesetwo fields also have followed different philoso-phies and principles.
For example, NLP aims atdeep understanding of individual words, phrasesand sentences (?micro-level?
), whereas DM aimsto conduct a high-level understanding, discoveryand synthesis of the most salient informationfrom a large set of documents when working ontext data (?macro-level?).
But they share thesame goal of distilling knowledge from data.
Inthe past five years, these two areas have had in-tensive interactions and thus mutually enhancedeach other through many successful text miningtasks.
This positive progress mainly benefitsfrom some innovative intermediate representa-tions such as ?heterogeneous information net-works?
[Han et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2012b].However, successful collaborations betweenany two fields require substantial mutual under-standing, patience and passion among research-ers.
Similar to the applications of machine learn-ing techniques in NLP, there is usually a gap ofat least several years between the creation of anew DM approach and its first successful appli-cation in NLP.
More importantly, many DM ap-proaches such as gSpan [Yan and Han, 2002]and RankClus [Sun et al., 2009a] have demon-strated their power on structured data.
But theyremain relatively unknown in the NLP communi-ty, even though there are many obvious potentialapplications.
On the other hand, compared toDM, the NLP community has paid more atten-tion to developing large-scale data annotations,resources, shared tasks which cover a wide rangeof multiple genres and multiple domains.
NLPcan also provide the basic building blocks formany DM tasks such as text cube construction[Tao et al., 2014].
Therefore in many scenarios,for the same approach the NLP experiment set-ting is often much closer to real-world applica-tions than its DM counterpart.We would like to share the experiences and les-sons from our extensive inter-disciplinary col-laborations in the past five years.
The primarygoal of this tutorial is to bridge the knowledgegap between these two fields and speed up thetransition process.
We will introduce two typesof DM methods: (1).
those state-of-the-art DMmethods that have already been proven effectivefor NLP; and (2).
some newly developed DMmethods that we believe will fit into some specif-ic NLP problems.
In addition, we aim to suggestsome new research directions in order to bettermarry these two areas and lead to more fruitfuloutcomes.
The tutorial will thus be useful forresearchers from both communities.
We will tryto provide a concise roadmap of recent perspec-tives and results, as well as point to the relatedDM software and resources, and NLP data setsthat are available to both research communities.2 OutlineWe will focus on the following three perspec-tives.2.1 Where do NLP and DM MeetWe will first pick up the tasks shown in Table 1that have attracted interests from both NLP andDM, and give an overview of different solutionsto these problems.
We will compare their funda-mental differences in terms of goals, theories,principles and methodologies.1Tasks DM Methods NLP MethodsPhrase mining / Chunk-ingStatistical pattern mining [El-Kishky etal., 2015; Danilevsky et al., 2014; Hanet al., 2014]Supervised chunking trainedfrom Penn TreebankTopic hierarchy / Tax-onomy constructionCombine statistical pattern mining withinformation networks [Wang et al.,2014]Lexical/Syntactic patterns (e.g.,COLING2014 workshop ontaxonomy construction)Entity Linking Graph alignment [Li et al., 2013] TAC-KBP Entity Linking meth-ods and WikificationRelation discovery Hierarchical clustering [Wang et al.,2012]ACE relation extraction, boot-strappingSentiment Analysis Pseudo-friendship network analysis[Deng et al., 2014]Supervised methods based onlinguistic resourcesTable 1.
Examples for Tasks Solved by Different NLP and DM Methods2.2 Successful DM Methods Applied forNLPThen we will focus on introducing a series ofeffective DM methods which have already beenadopted for NLP applications.
The most fruitfulresearch line exploited Heterogeneous Infor-mation Networks [Tao et al., 2014; Sun et al.,2009ab, 2011, 2012ab, 2013, 2015].
For exam-ple, the meta-path concept and methodology[Sun et al., 2011] has been successfully used toaddress morph entity discovery and resolution[Huang et al., 2013] and Wikification [Huang etal., 2014]; the Co-HITS algorithm [Deng et al.,2009] was applied to solve multiple NLP prob-lems including tweet ranking [Huang et al.,2012] and slot filling validation [Yu et al., 2014].We will synthesize the important aspects learnedfrom these successes.2.3 New DM Methods Promising for NLPThen we will introduce a wide range of new DMmethods which we believe are promising to NLP.We will align the problems and solutions by cat-egorizing their special characteristics from boththe linguistic perspective and the mining per-spective.
One thread we will focus on is graphmining.
We will recommend some effectivegraph pattern mining methods [Yan and Han,2002&2003; Yan et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2010]and their potential applications in cross-document entity clustering and slot filling.
Somerecent DM methods can also be used to captureimplicit textual cues which might be difficult togeneralize using traditional syntactic analysis.For example, [Kim et al., 2011] developed a syn-tactic tree mining approach to predict authorsfrom papers, which can be extended to moregeneral stylistic analysis.
We will carefully sur-vey the major challenges and solutions that ad-dress these adoptions.2.4 New Research Directions to IntegrateNLP and DMWe will conclude with a discussion of some keynew research directions to better integrate DMand NLP.
What is the best framework for inte-gration and joint inference?
Is there an idealcommon representation, or a layer between thesetwo fields?
Is Information Networks still the bestintermediate step to accomplish the Language-to-Networks-to-Knowledge paradigm?2.5 ResourcesWe will present an overview of related systems,demos, resources and data sets.3 Tutorial InstructorsJiawei Han is Abel Bliss Professor in the De-partment of Computer Science at the Universityof Illinois.
