The Anc ientCh inese  ideograph ic  wr i t ing  system,Kanj i ,  is today used in China, Japanand to some extent  in Korea.
Apr inc ipa l  advantage  of an ideograph icscr ip t  is that its unders tand ing  doesnot suppose  knowledge of the spokenlanguage.
Wr i t ten  Chinese,  e.g., isunders tood  all over the country ,  thoughthe spoken languages  are mutua l lyincomprehens ib le  /~/.
The maind i sadvantages  are obv ious ly  the largenumber  and graph ica l  complex i ty  ofwr i t ten  characters  and the consequenthardsh ip  of learn ing  and wr i t ing  them.Once learned,  reading,  instead,  doesnot p resent  equal  d i f f i cu l ty  thanks tothe exce l lent  pat tern  recogn i t ionab i l i ty  of man.

There fore ,  in Japan there is notrue so lu t ion  to computer i za t ionw i thout  the use of Kan j i  /I/.The demand for data te rmina ls  isinc reas ing  rap id ly .
For overcoming  thetechn ica l ,  manufactur ing  and humanfac tors  prob lems invo lved  in Kan j iinput  a number  of d i f fe rent  approacheshave been made or suggested .

Kana is theJapanese  phonemic  wr i t ing  system.

For Japanesewords  both Ch inese  characters  andH i ragana  are used.

It is notuncommon that severa l  Kanj i  charactersw i th  d i f fe rent  mean ing  have equal  or sos imi la r  p ronunc ia t ion  that they becomeident ica l  in Kana.
There  are e.g.some 70 Kanj i  characters ,  wh ich  arepronounced and t ranscr ibed  as "Shou" inKana  /4/.
On the other  hand manycharacters  have become to denoteconcepts  qui te  d i f fe rent  f rom theor ig ina l ,  wh ich  happened to haves imi la r  p ronunc ia t ion  /5/.

The character  pr inthead or d i sp lay  matr ix  only must haveh igher  order  to give the requ i redgraph ica l  reso lu t ion .

I~ fact, an equ ipment ,wh ich  wou ld  a l low to encode all Kanj icharacters  wou ld  be s imp ly  absurd  toimp lement  and to operate  byconvent iona l  keyboard  techn iques .
Indeve lop ing  keyboards  for typewr i te r ,te lex  and data te rmina ls  it has beennecessary  to severe ly  res t r i c t  andcare fu l ly  se lect  the set of charactersto be inc luded.
Yet it has beennecessary  e i ther  to squeeze  manycharacters  per key or to reduce  the keys ize so much that it can be operatedonly  by a spec ia l  imp lement .
Desp i tethis,  soph is t i ca ted  spec ia l  techn iquesfor input  of nonstandard  characters  arenecessary  in many app l i ca t ions .Nonstandard  characters  do f requent  invar ious  texts  and sub jec t  areas.

In order  to make thekeyboard  manageab le  by the humanoperator ,  the s ize of keys must havebeen made very smal l .
In the IBMequ ipment  the key d imens ion  is 4 mm.Th is  has permi t ted  to fit the keyboardon the table  of a normal  s ize cardpunch device.Us ing  such a keyboard  does,however ,  cause cons iderab le  eye s t ra into the operator  and requ i res  a lot ofhand t ranspor t .
Moreover ,  spec ia lmeans  of key ac tuat ion  such as a s ty lusas in /3/ or a pantograph  mechan ism asin /2/ and /7/ must  have beenin t roduced .Decgmpos i t ion  Schemes.. A t temptshave been made to deve lop  ra t iona ldecompos i t ion  schemes  in order  to breakthe characters  down into s imp ler  commone lements .
Th is  wou ld  a l low reduct ionof the keyboard  size.
The characterscou ld  then be p iecewise  reassembled  bytyp ing  from the i r  const i tuentcomponents ,  see e.g.

The smal l  s ize ofcharacters  causes,  however ,  more eyes t ra in  to the operator  and the larges ize of the keyboard  more fa t ique  tohand musc les  on the Japanese  equ ipment .A Rev iew of Techn iquesAn account  of some techn iques  andex is t ing  dev ices  for Kan j i  input isg iven  in /4/.

The aim of this talkhas only been to demonst ra te  thefeas ib i l i ty  of the idea and to pointout some of its imp l i ca t ions .Some Impl i ca t ionsA number  of key prob lems invo lvedin Kanj i  input  dev ices  and the i r  useseem to f ind the i r  so lu t ion  in the softd i sp lay  key input p r inc ip le .
The majorp rob lems so lved and advantages  ach ievedare as fo l lows:* The number  of keys and the s izeof the keyboard  can be reducedto what is cons idered  normal* ~et normal  key and character  s izecan be mainta ined  for good leg ib -i l i ty  and conven ient  operat ion* An un l imi ted  number  of Kanj icharacters  can be accommodated* New characters  can be added byde f in i t ion  as necessary* The character  set can be adaptedor changed from one app l i ca t ionto anotherThe character  layout  can bechanged from one convent ion  toanother  accord ing  to user  ski l l* The same keyboard  can be usedfor Kana, ASCI I  and st i l l  othercharacter  sets when necessaryat the same t ime- 292- -* The keyboard  can also be usedfor user  in teract ion  such asprompt ing ,  ind icat ion ,  etcMov ing  mechan ica l  parts  can befu l ly  e l im inated  and all keyscan be made ident ica l  to a l lowcost e f f i c ient  mass product ion .Opt ima l  Key and Keyboard  Size.The keyboard  can be des igned  intoopt ima l  s ize f rom manufactur ing  andhuman fac tors  po in ts  of view.
Yet thekey and character  s ize can be madelarge enough for good leg ib i l i ty  andconven ient  ac tuat ion  by bare f inger .The need for spec ia l  a r rangementsfor nonstandard  characters  andver i f i ca t ion  of entered  charactersbecomes  unnecessary .V i r tua l  Character  Sets.
Throughmenu s t ruc tur ing  and pag ing  anun l imi ted  number  of characters  can besuppor ted  independent ly  of the numberof phys ica l  d i sp lay  key f ie lds.
Itbecomes  poss ib le  to use d i f fe rent  s izekeyboards  for a g iven character  set andd i f fe rent  character  sets for a g ivens ize keyboard .
The only l im i t ingfac tors  are memory  space and d isp layras ter  reso lu t ion .
New characters  canbe added to the sys tem by programmeddef in i t ion  or by load ing  f rom externa lmedia .Por tab i l i ty  'and Adaptab i l i ty .So f tware  por tab i l i ty  and adaptab i l i tyare qua l i t ies ,  wh ich  re f lec t  the easeof mov ing  programs from one hardwareenv i ronment  to another  and mod i fy ingthem to fit d i f fe rent  ob jec t ives  /15/.The programmed key labe l l ing  pr inc ip lea l lows  these qua l i t ies  to be extendedto the man/computer  in ter face .Character  set dev ice  independenceprov ides  for a capab i l i ty ,  wh ich  can beca l led  human in ter face  por tab i l i ty .Th is  means that a character  set layoutand menu s t ruc ture  can be t rans fer redf rom one keyboard  to another  s imply  asa so f tware  copy.
If not d i rec t lycompat ib le ,  the convers ion  can be madeon so f tware  level .
This  qua l i ty  doescont r ibute  to reduced  need of operatorre t ra in ing  and h igher  equ ipmentusab i l i ty .Adap.tabi l i t~.
The need foradaptab i l i ty  emerges  f rom sys temdependence  on the app l i ca t ion  and userenv i ronment .
Sys tem adaptab i l i tyreduces  this dependence  and extends  thescope of potent ia l  sys tem app l i ca t ion .The d isp lay  key concept  does note l im inate  var ia t ion  or incompat ib i l i tyamong d i f fe rent  app l i ca t ion  or userenv i ronments ,  but it a l lows the sys temuser  in ter face  to be adapted  toandcompl ied  wi th  the d i f fe rent  convent ionsand requ i tements  by mod i f i ca t ion  andad jus tment  of the so f tware .
Even minoroperator  p re ferences  and hab i tuat ionscan be accommodated  eas i ly .
