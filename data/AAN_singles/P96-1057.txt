Processing Complex Sentences in the Centering FrameworkMichael StrubeFreiburg UniversityComputational Linguistics LabEuropaplatz 1, D-79085 Freiburg, Germanyst rube@ coling, uni- freiburg, deAbstractWe extend the centering model for the resolutionof intia-sentential naphora nd specify how tohandle complex sentences.
An empirical eval-uation indicates that the functional informationstructure guides the search for an antecedentwithin the sentence.1 IntroductionThe centering model (Grosz et al, 1995) focuseson the resolution of inter-sentential naphora.
Sinceintra-sentential naphora occur at high rates in real-world texts, the model has to be extended for the res-olution of anaphora t the sentence l vel.
However,the centering framework is not fully specified to han-die complex sentences (Suri & McCoy, 1994).
Thisunderspocification corresponds to the lack of a pre-cise definition of the expression utterance, a term al-ways used but intentionally left undefined 1.
There-fore, the centering algorithms currently under discus-sion are not able to handle naturally occurring dis-course.
Possible strategies for treating sentence-levelanaphora within the centering framework are1.
processing sentences linearly one clause at a time(as suggested by Grosz et al (1995)),2. preference for sentence-external ntecedentswhich are proposed by the centering mechanism,3.
preference for sentence-internal antecedentswhich are filtered by the usual binding criteria,4.
a mixed-mode which prefers only a particular setof sentence-internal over sentence-external an-tecedents (e.g.
Suri & McCoy (1994)).The question arises as to which strategy fits best for theinteraction between the resolution of intra- and inter-sentential naphora.
In my contribution, evidence for amixed-mode strategy isbrought forward, which favorsa particular set of sentence-internal antecedents givenby functional criteria.1Cf.
the sketchy statements by Brennan et al (1987,p.155): "\[...\] U is an utterance (not necessarily a full clause)\[...\]", and by Grosz et al (1995, p.209): "U need not to be afull clause.
"2 Constraints on Sentential AnaphoraOur studies on German texts have revealed that thefunctional information structure of the sentence, con-sidered in terms of the context-boundedness of dis-course lements, isthe major determinant for the rank-ing on the forward-looking-centers (C!
(U,)) (Strube& Hahn, 1996).
Hence, context-bound discourse le-ments are generally ranked higher in the C!
than anyother non-anaphoric element.
The functional informa-tion structure has impact not only on the resolution ofinter-sentential anaphora, but also on the resolution ofintra-sentential naphora.
Hence, the most preferredantecedent of an intra-sentential naphor is a phrasewhich is also anaphoric.
Consider sentences (1) and(2) and the corresponding centering data in Table 1(Cb: backward-looking center; the first dement of thepairs denotes the discourse ntity, the second elementthe surface).
In sentence (1), a nominal anaphor oc-curs, der T3100SX (a particular notebook).
In sentence(2), another nominal anaphor appears, der Rechner(the computer), which is resolved to T3100SX fromthe previous entence.
In the matrix clause, the pro-noun er (it) co-specifies the already resolved anaphorder Rechner in the subordinate clause.
(1) Ist der Resume-Modus aktiviert, schaltet sich derT3100SX selbstiindig ab.
(If the resume mode is active, - switches - itself - theT3100SX- automatically - off.
)(2) Bei spiiterem Einschalten des Rechners  arbeitet er so-fort an der alten Smile weiter.
(The - later - turning on - of the computer  - it - re-sumes working - at exactly the same place.

In order to empirically378strenghten this argument, we have examined severaltexts of different types: 15 texts from the informationtechnology (IT) domain, one text from the Germannews magazine Der Spiegel, and the first chapters ofa short story by the German writer Heiner Miiller 2 (cf.Table 2).
In the texts, 65 intra-sentential anaphors oc-I II text ana.

Table 3).
These data indicate that an approachbased on grammatical roles (Sm'i & McCoy, 1994) isinappropriate for the German language, while an ap-proach based on the functional information structureseems preferable.
In addition, we maintain that ex-changing rammatical with functional criteria is alsoa reasonable strategy for fixed word order languages.They can be rephrased in terms of functional crite-ria, simply due to the fact that grammatical roles andthe information structure patterns we defined, unlessmarked, coincide in these languages.I II cont.-bound --,bound II subj.

Each of these sentences i processed by ouralgorithm in linear order, one clause at a time withthe usual centering operations.
Compound sentenceswhich consist of multiple full clauses also have multi-ple Cb/C!
data.Now, we are able to define the expression utterancein a satisfactory manner: An utterance U is a simplesentence, a complex sentence, or each full clause of acompound sentence 3.
The C!
of an utterance is com-puted only with respect o the matrix clause.
Giventhese findings, complex sentences can be processed atthree stages (2a-2c; transitions from one stage to thenext occur only when a suitable antecedent has notbeen found at the previous tage):2Liebesgeschichte.

Note that we tried to eliminate r-ror chaining and false positives (for some remarks onevaluating discourse processing algorithms, cf.
Walker(1989); we consider her results as a starting point forour proposal).First, we examine the errors which all strategieshave in common (for the success rate, cf.
Table 4).99 errors are caused by underspecification at differ-ent levels, e.g., prepositional naphors (16), pluralanaphors (8), anaphors which refer to a member of aset (14), sentence anaphors (21), and anaphors whichrefer to a global focus (12) are not yet included in themechanism.
In 9 cases, any strategy will choose thefalse antecedent.The most interesting cases are the ones for whichthe performance of the different strategies varies.
Thelinear approach generates 40 additional errors in theanaphora resolution, which are caused only by the or-dering strategy to process each clause of sentenceswith the centering mechanism.
The approach whichprefers inter-sentential anaphora causes 60 additionalerrors.
Note that this strategy performs remarkablywell at first sight.
For 44 of the errors it chooses aninter-sentential antecedent which is, on the surface,identical to the correct intra-sentential antecedent.
Wecount hese 44 resolutions as false positives, since theanaphor has been resolved to the false discourse n-tity.
The approach which prefers intra-sentential an-tecedents causes 27 additional errors.
These errorsoccur whenever an inter-sentential anaphor can be re-solved with an incorrect intra-sentential antecedent.4We abstract here from the syntactic riteria for filteringout some elements of the current sentence by applying bind-hag criteria (Strube & Hahn, 1995).
Syntactic onstraintslike control phenomena override the preferences given bythe context.379I II r4 I linear I ex=a > int a I int a > extra I f ctional IIT 308 237 (?6,9%) 229 (?4,3%) 240 (77,9%) 247 (80,2%)Spiegel 102 82 (80,4%) 76 (74,5%) 82 (80,4%) 86 (84,3%)Mtlller 153 105 (68,8%) 99 (64,7%) 115 (75,3%) 128 (83,7%)I II 563 1424 (75,3%)1404 (71,8%)1437 (77,6%)1461 (81,9%) ITable 4: Success Rate without Semantic ConstraintsThe functional approach causes only 3 additional er-rors.
These errors occur whenever the antecedent ofan intra-sentential anaphor is not bound by the context(which is possible but rare) and when the anaphor canbe resolved at the text level.The results change slightly if semantic/conceptualconstraints (type and further admissibility constraints)on anaphora re considered.
22 errors of the lin-ear approach, 8 errors of the approach which prefersinter-sentential antecedents, and 12 errors of the ap-proach which prefers inter-sentential antecedents canbe avoided.
Only 6 errors of the functional approachcan be avoided by incorporating semantic riteria.This might constitute a cognitively valid argument forthe functional approach - the better the strategy, thelower the influence of semantics or world knowledgeon anaphora resolution.To summarize the results of our empirical eval-uation, we claim that our proposal based on func-tional criteria leads to substantively better esults forlanguages with free word order than the linear ap-proach suggested by Grosz et al (1995) and thetwo approaches which prefer inter-sentential or intra-sentential ntecedents.4 Comparison to Related WorkCrucial for the evaluation of the centering model(Grosz et al, 1995) and its applicability to naturallyoccurring discourse is the lack of a specification con-ceming how to handle complex sentences and intra-sentential anaphora.
Grosz et al suggest he pro-cessing of sentences linearly one clause at a time.We have shown that such an approach is not appro-priate for some types of complex sentences.
Suri& McCoy (1994) argue in the same manner, but weconsider the functional approach for languages withfree word order superior to their grammatical criteria,while, for languages with fixed word order, both ap-proaches should give the same results.
Hence, our ap-proach seems to be more generally applicable.
Otherapproaches which integrate the resolution of sentence-and text-level anaphora re based on salience metrics(Haji~ov~i et al, 1992; Lappin & Leass, 1994).
Weconsider such metrics to be a method which detractsfrom the exact linguistic specifications a  we proposethem.At first sight, grammar theories like GB (Chomsky,1981) or I-IPSG (Pollard & Sag, 1994), are the bestchoice for resolving anaphora t the sentence-level.But these grammar theories only give filters for ex-cluding some elements from consideration.
Neithergives any preference for a particular antecedent a thesentence-level, nor do they consider text anaphora.5 ConclusionsIn this paper, we gave a specification for handlingcomplex sentences inthe centering model based on thefunctional information structure of utterances in dis-course.
We motivated our proposal by the constraintswhich hold for a free word order language (German)and derived our results from data-intensive empiricalstudies of real texts of different types.Some issues remain open: the evaluation of thefunctional pproach for languages with fixed word or-der, a fine-grained analysis of subordinate clauses asSuri & McCoy (1994) presented for SX because SYclauses, and, in general, the solution for the caseswhich cause rrors in our evaluation.Acknowledgments.
