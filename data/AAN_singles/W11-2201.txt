Proceedings of EMNLP 2011, Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, page 1,Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, July 27?31, 2011. c?2011 Association for Computational LinguisticsAbstract for the Invited TalkUnsupervised NLP and Human Language Acquisition: Making Connections to Make ProgressSharon GoldwaterNatural language processing and cognitive science are two fields in which unsupervised languagelearning is an important area of research.
Yet there is often little crosstalk between the two fields.In this talk, I will argue that considering the problem of unsupervised language learning from acognitive perspective can lead to useful insights for the NLP researcher, while also showing howtools and methods from NLP and machine learning can shed light on human language acquisition.I will present two case examples, both of them models inspired by cognitive questions.
The first is amodel of word segmentation, which introduced new modeling and inference techniques into NLP whilealso yielding a better fit than previous models to human behavioral data on word segmentation.
Thesecond is more recent work on unsupervised grammar induction, in which prosodic cues are used tohelp identify syntactic boundaries.
Preliminary results indicate that such cues can be helpful, but alsoreveal weaknesses in existing unsupervised grammar induction methods from NLP, suggesting possibledirections for future research.1
