These are each specializedcomputer science research fields with distinct objectives andassumptions.
The narrower goals involve making it possible fora computer user to employ a near natural-language mode forproblem-salving, information retrieval, and other applications.Naturdl computer responses have also been created and a specialterm, "understanding", has been used to describe the resultingcomputek-human dialogues.
Phe purpose of this paper is tosurvey these recent developments to make the A1 literature ac-cessible to researchers mainly interested in computation onwritten text or spoken language.1, INTRODUCTIONThe computer literature discussed in this paper usesseveral linguistic terms in special ways, when there is apossibility sf congusion, quotation marks will be used toidentify technical terms in computer science.
The term"understanding" is frequently used as a synonym for "the addi-tion of logical relationships or semantics to syntactic pro-cessing".
This use is substantially qarrower than the word'simplicit association with "human behavior implemented bycomputer'' the narrower use is introduced as a neutral refe-rence point, The question of whether a computer porgram canoperate in a human-like way is central to artificial intelli-gence.
"Do current 'understanding' program systems show howextended human-like capability can be implemented using com-puters?"
is a related pragmatic questton Initially thisinvestigation sought to examine whether programs which "under-stand" language in the stipulated narrow sense are protatypeswhich could lead to expanded capability.
Unfortunately,"language understanding" and its special subtopic "speeehunderstanding'' are insufficiently developed to permit profi-table discussion of the original question Hence an opera-tional approach to the recent literature is taken here.
Thispaper outlines how "language understanding" research has evolvedand identifies key elements of program organization used toachieve limited computer "understanding".2, LEVEL AND DOMAINCurrent A 1  programs for lankuage processing are organizedby level and restricted to specified domains.
This sectionpresents those ideas and comments on the limitations thatthey entail.Three principal levels of language-processing software are1.
"Lexical" (allowed vocabulary)2.
"Syntactic" (allowed phrases or sentences)3 "Semantic" (allowed meanings)ln practice all these levels must operate many times for thecomputer to interpret even a small portion, say two words, ofrestricted natural-language input.
Programs that performoperations on each level are, respectively,1.
Word in a table?2.
Word string acceptable grammatically?3.
Word string acceptable logically?A program to detect "meaning" (logical consequences of wordinterpretations) must also perform grammatical operations forcertain words to determine a part of speech (noun, verb, adjec-tive, etc.)
One method makes a tentative assigrlment, parses,then tests for plausibility via consistency with known facts.To reduce the complexity of this task, the designer limitsthe subset of language allower or the "world" (i.e.
the subject)discussed.
The word "domain" sums up this concept, other termsfor "restricted domain" are "limited scope of discourse","narrow problem domain", and "restricted English framework"The limitation of vocabulary or context constrains thelexicon and semantics of the "language".
The t rend i n  t h edesign of software for "natural-language understanding" isto deal with (a) a specialized vocabulary, and (b) a parti-cular context or set  of allowed interpretations in order toreduce processing time.
Although computing results for severalhighly specialized problems Le,g.
7, 231 are impressive exam-ples of language processing in restricted domains, they donot answer several key concerns.1.
Do specialized vocabularies have sufficientcomplexity to warrant comparison with truenatural language?2 .
Are current "understanding" programs, orga-nized by level and using domain reatrictidn,extendable to true natural language?The realities are severe.
Syntactic processing is interdependentwith meaning and involves the allowed logical relationshipsamong words %n the lexicon.
Most natural-language software ishighly developed at the "syntactic" level Howwer, the numberof times the "syntactic" level must be ent'ered can grow explo-sively as the "naturalness" of the language to be processedincreases.
Success on artificial domains cannot imply a greatdeal about processing truly natural language.3 ,  PROGRAM SYSTEMSThe systems cited in this section answer questions, per-form commands, or conduct dialogues.Programs that enable a user to execute a task via computerin an on-line mode are generally called "interactive" Somesystems are so rich in their language-processing capabilitythat they are called "conversational" Systems that havecomplicated capabilities and can reply with a sophisticatedtesponse to an inquiry are called "question answering".
Thesurvey [I] discusses two "conversational" pkograms ELIZA[2, 31 and STUDENT [41, which answers questions regardingalgebraic word problems.
SIR [51 answers questions aboutlogic.
Both [41 and [51 appear in [61 , the introd,rctionthere provides a general discussion of "semantic informationand computer programs involving "semantics"The "question-answering" program systems described in[2 -51 were sophisticated mainly in methods of solving a prob-lem or determining a response to a statement.
Other systemshave emphasized the retrieval of facts encoded in English.The "blocks-world" system described in [71 contrasts withthese in that it has sophisticated language-processing capa-bility It infers antecedents of pronouns and resolves ambi-guities in input word strings regarding blocks on a table.The distinction between "interactive", "conversational", and"question-answering" is less important when the blocks-worldis the.
domain.
The computer-science contribution is a programto interaet ,wfth the domain as if it could "underktand" theinput, in the sense that it takes the proper action even whenthe input is somewhat ambiguous.
To resolve ambiguities theprogram refers to existing relationships among the blocks.The effect of [71  was to provide a sophisticated example ofcomputer "understanding" which led to attempts to apply simi-lar principLes to speech inputs.
(More detail on parallel de-velopments in speech processing is presented later.
)The early "language-understanding" systems, BASEBALL [ 9 ] ,ELLZA, and STUDENT, were based on two special formats: one torepresent the knowledge they store and one to find meaning inthe English input.
They discard all input information whichcannot be transformed for internal storage.
The comparisonof ELIZA and STUDENT in [I] is with regard to the degree of"understanding" ELIZA responds either by transfoiming theinput sentence (essentially mimicry) following isolation of akey word or by using a prestored content-free remark.
STUDENTtranslates natural-language "descriptions of algebraic equations,... proceeds to identify the unknowns involved and the relation-ships which hold between them, and (obtains and solves) a setof equations" [ I ,  p 851.
Hence ELIZA munderstands" only a fewkey words; it transf6rms these words via a seatence-reassemblyrule, discards other parts of the sentence, and adds stockphrases to create the response.
STUDENT solves the underlyingalgebraic problem-- i t "unders'tands" in that it "answers questionsbased on information contained in the input" [4, p. 1351 .
ELIZAresponds but does not "understand", since the reply has littleto do with the information in the input sentence, but ratherserves to keep the person in a dialogue.Programs with an ability to spout back similar to ELIZA'susually store a body of text and an indexing scheme to it.
Thisapproach has obvious limitations and was replaced by systemsthat use a formal representation to store limited logicalconcepts associated with the text.
One of them is SIR, whichcan deduce set relationships anong objects described by naturallanguage.
SIR is designed to meet the requirement that "inaddition tu echoing, upon request, the facts it has beengiven, a machine which 'understands' must be able to recog-nize the logical implications of those facts.
It alqo mustbe able to identify (from a large data store) facts which arerelevant to 8 particular question'' [51 .Limited-logic systems are important because they providemethods to represent complex facts encoded in English-languagestatements so that the facts can be used by computer programsor accessed by a person who did not input the original textualstatement of the fact.
Such a second user may employ a com-pletely different form of language encoding.
Programs of thissort include DEACON [lo, 111 and the early version of CONVERSE[121.
The former could "handle time questions" and useda bottom-up analysis method which allowed questionsto be nested.
For example, the question "Who isthe commander of the battalion at Fort Fubar?"
washandled by first internally answering the questian"What battalion is at Fort Fubar?"
The answer wasthen substituted directly into the original questionto make ic "Who is the commander of the 69th batta-lion?"
which the system then answered.
[7 ,  p. 371CONVERSE contained provisions for allwing even more complexforms of input questions (Recent versions are described in113-151 .
)Deductive systems can be divided into general systemswhich add a flrst-order predicate-calculus theorem-provingcapability to limited-loglc systems to improve the complexityoE the facts they can "infer", and proccdurnl systcms whichenable other computations to obtain complex information Thetheorem-proving capability is designed to work Erom a groupof logical statements given as input (or statements consistentwith the'se input s-tements) However, facts INCONSISTENTwith the original statements cannot always be detected anddeductive systems quickly become impractical as the number ofinput statements (elementary facts, axioms) becomes large[ b ,  7, 161, since the time to obtain a proof grows to an im-practical length.
Special programming languages (e.g.
QA4[17, 181 , PLANNER [20 ,  211 ) , have added strategy capabilitiesand better methods of problem representation to reduce computingtime to practical valuesQA4 (seeks) to develop natural, intuitive represen-tations of problems and problem-solving programs.

procedural and declarativeinformation that includes explicit instructions,intuitive advice, and semantic definitions.
?171However, there is currently no body of evidence regarding theeffectiveness of the programs written in this programminglanguage or related ones on problem-solving tasks in generalor "lapguage understanding1' in particular.
There is a needfor experimental evaluation of the strategies that the pro-gsahing language permits for "language understanding" problems.Procedural deductive systems facilitate the augmentationof an existing store of complex information.
Usually systemsrequire a new set of subprograms to deal with new data:each change in a subprogram may affect more of theother subprograms.
The structure grows more awkwardand difficult to generalize.
.
.
.
Finally, the.
systemmay become too unwieldy for further expkrimentation.15, p. 911In procedural systems the software is somewhat modular In19 "semantic primitives" were assumed to exist as LISP sub-routines.
PLANNER 1201 allows complex information to beexpressed as procedures without requiring user involvementwith the details of interaction anong procedures (but [21]reports some second thoughts).The work of many other groups could be added to thissurvey.
Recent work on REL, building on on [ l o ,  111 isreported in [36, 371; [24, 251 are relevant collections; and[26] is a survey paper.4, DEDUCTIONIn all of the program systems described thus far, "languageunderstanding" depends on the "deductive capabilities" of the*Some experiments on problem-solving effectiveness ofspecial programing languages in another context appear in [ 2 2 ] .program, tha t  i s ,  i t s  a b i l i t y  to  "infer" f a c t s  and rela.tionshipsfrom given statements.

,  outside information such as knowledge aboutLhe domain.In most "understanding" programs, information on a primitive level of processing can be inaccurate; for example, theidentification of a sound string "blew" can be inaccurately"blue" Subsequent processing levels combine identified pri-mitives.
If parts of speech are concerned, the level is syn-tactic; if meaning is involved, "semantic"; if domain is in-volved, the lave1 is that of the "world".
Sach level can bean aid in a deductive process, leading to "understanding" aninput segment of language.
Programs NOW EXIST which opera-tionally satisfy most of the following points concerning"understanding" in narrow domains (emphasis has been added)Perhaps tha most importaht criterion for undersvand-ing a language is the ability TO RELATE THE INFORMA-TION CONTAINED in a sentence TO KNOWLEDGE PREVIOUSLYACQUIRED.

[28  pp.
3 - 4 )This has been accomplished through clever (and lengthy) com-puter programming, and by taking advantage of structure inhe-rent in special proklem domains such as stacking blocks ona table, moving chess pieces, and retrieving facts about alarge naval organization.Program systems for understanding begin with a "frontend": a portion designed to transform language input into acomputer representatiort.
The representation may be as simpleas a character-by-character encoding of alphabetic, spacemarker, and punctuation elements.
However, a complex "frontend" could involve word and phrase detection anti encoding.The usual computer science term fol a computer representationis "data structure'' [271 and there are many types.
The languageprocessimg program DEACON used ring sqructures 1111, a repre-sentation frequently used to store queues.
In principle adata structure can represent involved associations, but inpractice simple order or ancestor relationships predominateCompletely different and far more complex types of structureare inherent in natural language.
For example, from 1281"The-professors signed a petition."
is not true.has for valid interpretations:(a) The professors DIDN'T sign a petition.
(b) THE PROFESSORS didn't sign a petition.
( c )  The professors didn't sign a PETITION.
(d) The professors di'dn't SIGN a petition:Iterative substitution of alternatives to deduce overall mean-ing yields cumbersome processing, especially when there arenested uncertainties.
The recursive properties associatedwith the data structure term "list" [271 are not easilyadapted to multiple meanings.
Hence, representing linguisticdata for computation is ah opwr a n d  fundamental researrhproblem.
Nevertheless, the programs which de~uce facts fromlanguage do so withnut a clear best technique for computerrepresentation.
To do this, restrictions on the languageimplicit in the input domain are used, and repeated process-ing by level (lexical, syntactic, semantic) is used in theabsence of an efficient representation language.
Data struc-tures that facilitate following the language structure areneeded Existing programs provide special solutions to theproblems of deductive processing in narrow language domainsWhile these programs are not a general breaktht-ough in reure-senting language data for computation, they demonstrate thatcurrent programming t.echniques enable a us.eful "understanding"capability Furthermore, tbere is a reql potential for useot the "understanding" in an interactive node to facilitateuse of computers by nonspecialists and to tap fhe more sophis-ticated human understanding capabilities5 INTERACT I ONResearch and computer program development desrgned tostore multitudes of facts so that they can be accessed [ 2 9 ]qx combined [301 and "unders,tood (see pp.
3-10 in [301') inlinguistic form (see pp.
11-17 of [30]) is highly relevant torecent research programs in text and speech understanding.When such a system is used a user might f a i l  to get a fact orrelataonship because the natural-language subset chosen torepresent his question was too righ--i.e., it includes a com-plex set of logical relationships not in the computer.
Thosa block could result in a human-computer dialogue if theprogram has no logical connection between "garage" and "car"but only between "garage" and "house" (the program replies"OK" or "??
'!I1 to user input sentences)I L I K E  CHEVROLETS.OKCHEVROLETS ARE E c o ~ o M I C A L .OKM.Y HOUSE HAS A LARGE GARAGE.O KI CAN GET TWO I N??
?The computer failed to "understand" that there was no changeof discourse subject.
This is an example of a "semantfo"failure w h i ~ h  could be overcome by interaction.
That is; thehuman user would need to dnput one more meaning or associa-tion of a valid word so that computer "understanding" may beachieved.
Syntactic blocks may also occur.
M. Denicoffpointed out that in [7] 172 different syntactic features wereused fox  a situation where there are no statements with psy-chological content and no use of simile.
If the psychologicalmeanings are added as in 1381, these features would not beenough to describe all the possible meanings of a text drawnfrom a less artificial soprce.
I n d e e d ,  a key problem whichformal granhars seem ill-suited for is t h e  reality that manycontexts may-be sifiultaneousLy valid: multiple meanings givenatural-language communication the richness of ovextones, anasubtleties--poetry carries this ta an extreme.The above dialogue on "Chevroletsl' is an example of whatCarbonell [ 3 9 ,  p. 1941 called "mixed-initiative discourse".This important aspect of interaction is considered in the LISPprogram DWIM ("Do What I .Mean1'), which is a useful working toolfor text-input error correction precisely because it "under-stands" the user's character~stics .
(For example, typicalspelling errors .)
This is discussed by Teitelman 140, 41 ,, 421A great deal of effort has been put into making DWI-N'-'smartn.
Expkrience with perhaps a dazen differentusers indichtes we have been very successful: DWIMseldom fails to correct an error the user feels itshould have, and almost never mistakenly corrects anerror.
[40 ,  p. 111Another limited-discourse interactive program 1431 facilitatesintroduction of expert knowledge on 7hess.
The program usessearch with a maxitnum look-ahead depth of 20 and has back-tracking capability; both s,yntactic and semantic knowledge isincorporated.
By grouping similar board positions (i.e., allinvolving a piece on cell 1, all involving a queen moue), itimposes semantic organization on the vast files to be searchedand improves syntactic processing speedBublication of 1443,  which coined the term "speechunderstanding", initiated,the natural next ,step toward use ofthe computer's "understandfng" capability.
The goal of easyintqraction with the computer becomes more exciting withspeech as input medium.
Systems to  recognize both text andspeech have used syntax and context [ 4 5 ,  461, but [471 addeda comprehensive approach using multiple processing levels toresoLve ambiguities., In the dkrect successors of this work[ 8, 4 9 1 ,  the same Frocess of parriaL acceptance of primitiveelements (phonemic candidates from digitized acoustic data)followed by lexical, syntactic, and semantic processing korank alternatives has shown significant success.
Reddy (in a,Carnegie-Mellon University film on the Hearsay System) sta-teehat on 144 connected utterances, involving 676 words, obtainedfrom 5 speakers, performing 4 tasks (chess, news retrieval,medical diagnosis, and desk calculator use), req.uiring 28 to76-word vocabul~ries, t,he computer program recognition, interms of words spotted and identified correctly, wasa .
89% with all sources of kmm1edge.
67% without use of semantic bowledgec .
44% without use of sptactic or semantic knowledgeThese results were obtained in October 1973, and have been im-proved since [501.
However, a key limitation of this form ofcomputer speech "understandkng" is response rate.
Reddyestimated that the third w~rd-accuracy figure (without use ofsyntactic and semantic knowledge) would have to be in excessof 90% to allow the program to achieve a near-human responsespeed.The nature of computer "understanding" programs leads toproblems of combinatoric explosion in number of alternativesand this lessens the usefulness of multilevel program organi-zation (acoustic-phonetic, lexical, syntactic, semantic,domain, and user interactions) as much in speech processing asin text pro.cessing.
Prototype speech "understanding" systemshave been build 1 4 9 ,  501 and newer acoustic-phonetic andsyntactic techniques have been incorporated into this work[ 4 9 ,  51, 521, yet it seems clear that the development of theoryin prosody and grammar cannot provide a breakthrough to escapethe combinatoric explosion.
The reason is that the search ofparse rrees and the use of semantics (look up related words)depend on a single context--both take geometrica'lly increasingamounts of computing time as the number of contexts grows.Furthermore, this increase in time is added onto that whichoccurs when the size of lexicon is expanded.
ks words areadded, the number of trees that can Be-produced by the gram-mar's rewriting rules in an attempt to "recognize" a stringexpqnds rapidly.
Hence in speech as in text processing,"under,standihgn1 exists via computer yet it is not likely tolead to rhachine processing of truly natural language.
Indeedthe artificiality of speech "understanding" by computer iseven greater than that of text input.
The "moon rocks" textsystem [ 3 3 ,  351 used a vocabulary of 3500 words, while thespeech "understanding" version based on it [5M used only250 words.The COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY of systems that recognizeisolated words with 98.5% accuracy [531* and the need f o ra rapid human-computer input interface [ 5 4 ]  promise that thelast word has not been spoken on "understanding".
Researchand development on language handling systems is continuing int h e  hope of achieving useful "understanding".
Indeed, Stan-ford Research ,Institute's Artificial Intelligence Center isbasing its current work on the just-mentioned isolated-wordrecognizer.
It is likeap that useful developments will occurwhere language, and probably spoken-language, "understanding"will be exhibtred.
These developments will occur throughcareful design of tasks and use of advances in computertechnology However, the general problem of machine' "under-standing" of natural language- -whether text Dr speech- - is notlikely to be aided by these developments.7 CONCLUS IONSA large body of research in computer science is devotedto language processing.
A survey of the program systems that*Threshold Technology Inc. has sold such a system to se -veral users.
Their VIP-100 includes a miriicamputer dedicatedto the recognition task; there are otker isolated-word systems[541have been reported shows that two main goals have emerged:1 To enable "intelligent" processing by thecomputer ("hrtificial intelligence")2.
To produce a more useful way t o  accessd a a  and solve problems ("man-machineinteraction")Techniques in artificial intelligence and speech recognitionhave been developed to the extent that prototype computerprogram systems which exhibit "understanding" have been de-veloped for highly limited conrexts.
To extend these pro-grams to larger subsets of natural language poses problens,it is unlikely that any of the yesearch directivns currentlybeing explored will of thewselves "solve" the I1na.tural language problem".
(The techniques include, but are not limitedto, further developments in artificial intelligence program-ming languages [17, 18 20, 21, 551.; refinements in theoriesof grammar; improved deductive ability, possibly by bettertheorem-proving techniques; and the introduction of stress-related features in the ehcoding of speech [52].
A usefulcollection of language models appears in [ 5 6 ] . )
Nevertheless,prorotype systems for "understanding" both text and speech areuseful achievements of engineering, and spoken entry of databy humans to computers is beginning to be established byisolated-word re-cognizers which use a minicomputer dedicatedto the task.
A multiplicity of purposes beyond this simplebut practical task of data entry are mentioned briefly in theforegoing discussion of "interaction".
Developments along,the many diverse paths indicated under that heading arelikely to be rapid in the future as practical "unders tanding"o f  subsets of l a n g u a g e  becomes part of computer technologyFar another view of the evolution of that process ,  see [ 5 7 ] .REFERENCES1.

A survey of subscribes-members will be included in the last packet mailed during 1975to establish patterns of coverage for fdture years.Categorization Bf entries deepens as the field defines itselfand the collection of literature against which new items can.be matched increases.
The advice of members is welcome.Many summaries are authors' abstracts, sometimes edited forclarity, brevity, or completeness.
Where possible, an infor-mative summary i.s provided.The Linguistic Documentation Centre of the University ofOttawa provides many entries; by editorial accident, someof the entries recently received from that source remain tobe included in the next issue.

Theoreticel fssues in Natural LanguageProcessing, 1975,  134-139.There are two tasks for which methodologies are used, (a)building intelligent: machines, and (b) under standing human languageperformance, Both depend on the development of a 'device-indepen-dent ' language, understanding theory.
Fof theoretical studies, amethodology should be cognitively efficient and should deal effect-ively with the problem of scale--having a large number of factsembodied in the theory.
Studies should be performed in the contextof total language understanding; isolat ion of qomponents limitsscope.
Intuition on human language performance is a good guide tocomputational linguistics.Phonetics -.Phonology : .RecognitionSPEECH RECOGNITION BY COMPUTER : A BIBLIOGRAPHY WITH ABSTRACTSD.

There are threekinds of attributes: relations, whose value is a pointer to otherrecords; properties, with values either numbers or characterstrings; and indicators, whose values have a role similar to lin-guistic featires.

This theory re- k jects 'backup as a standard contro mechamsm for parsing.
Agrammar is a set of modules.
The parser works on two levels, agroup level and a clause level.
Group level modules work on a wordbuffer and build group level structures.
Modules have a pattern,a pretest procedure and a body to be executed if the pattern matchesand the pretest succeeds.
If the parser fails, it keeps the struc-ture constructed to date, and makes whatever substructures it canfrom the remaining part.Grammar : ParserWilliam WhiteNational Inst i tutes  of HealthDivislon of Computer Research and TechnologyBethesda, MarylandJournal of Clinica l  Computing, 3, 180-102, 1973A morphological analyzer is written in P L / ~  using a recursivemacro actuated generator.

Nash-Webber, ds., Thearetical Issues i n  Natural LanguageProcessing, 1975, 38-41.If semantic primitives are seen as essentially djtfferentfrom words, this leads to attempts to justify them directly,usually psychological~y.
Otherwise the justification is merelythat they work.
Primitives can be taken as a small naturallanguage, with no essential difference betQeen primitives andmrde.
But the set of primitives cannot be extended indefinitely.ptherwise the distinction between the representation end thenntural language will be lost.
If it is not possible to escapef r w  natural language into another realm, one cannot separatesemantic representation from reasoning as is attempted.
It isprobably more sensible to say that natural.

This has not yet been experimentally tested.Experiments have shown that a listener may simulate a story fromthe point of view of an observer or of a participaht in the story.One problem that this raises for AI, if a program can construct aninterconnected structure from the text, is the non-uniqueness ofthis meaning representation, Another problem is that programs shouldnot be designed to preserve all details, but then, what should beforgotten; point of view may be useful hereSemantics - Discourse : Compreha46onHer'bert H.

One kind of inference incomprehension is in the context of given-new information: the speakertries to construct the given and new information of each utterance,so that the listener is able to compute unique antecedents for thegiven information, and so that  he will not already have the new in-formation attached to the antecedent.
Inference mechanisms includedirect reference, identity, pronominalization, epithets, set member-ship, indirect reference by association, indirect reference bycharacterization, reaaons, causes, conseqQences, and concurrences.Bridging inferences need not be determinate, but in discourse theyseemingly are, and further, are the inferences with fewest assump-tions.

383The preface is reprinted an the following framesby permission.REPRESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDINGP r e f a c eJ a i m e  Carbonell was our fr iend and colleague.
Formany years he  worked with 11s on problems i n  Art i f ic ialIntelligence, especially on t h e  developrnerit of RII intel l igentinstructionnl system.
Jainle directed t h e  ArtificinlIntelligence group e t  Bolt, Deranek, and Ncwman ( inCambridge, Massnchusetts) un t i l  h i s  dea th  i n  1973.
Someof us  who hod worlred with Ja ime decided to hold aconference i n  his nlemory, a confcrerlce whose guidingprinciple wonld be t h a t  Jaime would have enjoyed it.
T h i sbook is the  resul t  of t h a t  conferencb.J a i n ~ e  Carbonell's isnportant contr ibut ion to cognitivescience is  best sumnlarized in t h e  t i t le  of one of hispublicatio~ls: A7 irt CAI.
Jaime wanted t o  p u t  principles oEAritificial Intelligence i n t o  Computer-Assisted Instruct ion(CAI) systems.
H e  dreamed of a system which had  a database of knowledge about a topic mat te r  and generalinformation about  language and t h e  principles of tutor ialinstruction.
The  system could then  pursue a na tura ltutor ial  dialog with a student; sometimes following thestudent 's initiative, sometimes taking i t s  own int ia t ive,  bu talways generating i t s  statements rind responses i n  a na tura lway from i t s  general knowledge.
T h i s  system contrastssharply wi th  existing systems for  Computer-AssistedInstruct ion i n  which a relatively fixed sequence of questionsand possible reponses have to be determined f o r  each topic.J a i m e  did construct working versions of h i s  &ream--in asystem which he called SCHOLAR.
B u t  h e  died befoi-eSCHOLAR reached t h e  ful l  realization of t h e  dream.It was a pleasure to  work with Jaime.
His  kindness andh i s  enthusiasm were infectious, and t h e  discussions we hadwi th  him over the  years  were a great  s t imulus t o  o u r  ownthinking.
Both as a friend and a colleague we miss himgreatly.Cognitive Science.
T h i s  book contains studies in a newf ie ld we call cognitive science.
Cognitive science includeselements of psychology, computer science, linguistics,philosophy, and education, b u t  i t  i s  more than  t h eintersection of these disciplines.
The i r  integrat ion hasproduced a new set  of tools for  dealing w i t h  a broad rangeREPRESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDINGof questions.
In recent years, the interdctions among theworkers in these fields has led to exciting newdevelopments in our undemtanding of intelligent systemsand the development of a science of cognition.
The groupof workers has pursued problem$ that  did not appear to besolvable from within any single discipline.
It  is too earlyto predict the future course of this new interaction, butthe work to date has been stimulating and inspiring.
I t  i sour hope that  this  book can serve as an illustrntion of thetype of problems Chat can be qq~roached throughinterdisciplinary cooperation.
The participants in this book(and at  the conference) represent the fields sf ArtificialIntelligence, Linguistics, and Psychology, all of whom workon similar problems but with different viewpoints.
Thebook focuses on the common problems, hopefully acting as away of bringing these issues to the attention of all workersin those fields related to cognitive science.Subject Matter.
The book contains four sections.
In thefirst section, Theory of Representotion,  general issuesinvolved in building representations of knowledge areexplored.
Daniiel G. Bobrow proposes that solutions to a setof design issues be used as dimensions for comparingdifferent represetltations, and he examines different formssuch solutions might take.
William A.
Woods exploresproblems in representing natural-language statements insemantic networks, illustrating difficult theoretical issuesby examples.
Joseph D. Becker is concerned with therepresentation one can infer for behavioral systems whoseinternal workings cap not be observed directly, and heconsiders the interconnection of useful concepts such ashierarchical organization, system gaals, and resourceconflicts Robert J. Bobrow and John Seely Brown presenta model for an expert understander which can take acollection of data &scribing some situation, synthesize acontingent knoultedge structure which places the input drrta inthe context of a larger structural organization, and whichanswers questions about the situation based only on thecontingent knowledge structure.Section two, New Memory Models, discusses theimplications of the assumption that  input information isalways interpreted in  terms of large structural units derivedREPFLESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDINGfrom esporionce.
Daniel G. Bobrow and Donnld A. Normanpostulate active sciicrnnla i n  memory which r ~ f e r  to eachother through use of car~tuxl-deper~derlt descriptions, andwhir11 respo~irl both to input  data and to hypothcs~s  aboutstructure.
Benjamin J. Kuipers describes thc  conc~l ) t  of aframe us a structural organizing uni t  for  data ele~nents, nndhe discusses the use of these uni ts  in the context of nrecognition system.
Terry Winogrod explores issuesi~lvolved in the controversy on rcl~rcsc~lt ing knowledge iudeclarative vcrsus procedural form.
Winogr~t l  uses theconcept of a frame ns a basis for the synthesis of thedeclarative and proccdural tipproaches.
The frame providesan organizing structure on which to attach both declarativeand procedural informhtion.T h e  third section, l l i g h e r  Level  S t r u c t u r e s ,  focuses onthe representation of plans, episodes, and stories withinmemory.
David E. Rumelhart proposes a grammar for  well-formed stories.
'His summarization rules for stories basedon t h i s  grammar seem to provide reasonable predictions ofhuman behavior.
Roger C. Schank postulates that i nunderstanding paragraphs, the  reader fills in causalconnections between propositions, and t h a t  such causallylinked chains are t h e  basis for  most human memoryorganization.
Robert P Abelson defines a notation inwhich to describe the  intended effects of plans, and toexpress the conditions necessary for  achieving desired states.T h e  fourth section, Semantic Knowledge  i nU n d e r s t a n d e r  Sys tems ,  describes how knowledge has beenused in  existing systems.
John  Seely.Brown and Richard R.Bur ton  describe a system which uses multiplerepresentations to achieve expertise in  teachiog a s tudentabout  debugging electronic circuits.
Bonnie Nash-Webberdescribes the role played by semantics in the understandingof continuous speech in a limited domain of discourse.Allan Collins, Eleanor H. Warnock, Nelleke Aiello, andMark L. Viller  describe a continuation of work on JaimeCarbonell's SCHOLAR system.
They examine how liumansuse strategies to f ind  reasonable answers to questions fo rwhich they do net  have the knowledge to answer wi thcertainty, and how people can be taught  t o  reason th i s  way.iiiREPRESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDINGAcknowledgments.

Hays'stheory uses paradigmatic, syntagmatic, discursive, attitudinal, andmetalingual (MTL) arcs.
The MTL arcs shift level of abstraction;e.g., anemia is neither a fewness nor an erythrocyte but an abstractcondition.
An abstract definition can include several syntagmaticpropositions, linked discursively.
A medical term can be linked byMTL to definitions in different languages (clinical, ~athophysio-logical, etc.

However, both episodic and semantic memoriesmust have similar power of representation, so their structures arenot disttnguishable.
Similarly, a lexical memory must have thepower to represent propositional information about words.
Thus,the fabric of knowledge is merely cut into different shapes.Semantics - Discourse : MemoryA FORMALISM FOR RELATING LEXICAL AND PRAGMATIC INFORMATI ON:ITS  RELEVANCE TO RECOGNITION AND GENERATIONAravind K.

The dbtinction as been rejected, be-cause it is said that since we know everything Erom experience,there is no room for the distinction.
The error lies in confusingknowledge from knowledge, and knowledge of knowledge.
Semanticknowledge is knowledge that has been reorganized around conceptsfrom knowledge originally encoded around events; it fs stripped ofpersonal experience.
One question raised by the distinction is howdoes information get into semantic memory, and how and when does itget 10s t from episodic memory.Semantics - Discourse : Memory~CTD-MOUTH ING FRAMESJerry FeldmanUniversity of RochesterNew YorkIn: R .

Thisis counter to the claim that we symbolically store a large numberof separate views.
Another problem is with the assumption of de-fault values for slots in frames.
In the extreme, this givesvisual perception without vision.
The evidence is that people canunderstand totally unexpected images presented for quite shortpexiods.

The only test of a naturallanguage system is its success on a task, any demand for more theorymust bear this in mind.
Neither can recent work in A 1  be regardedas theoretical; it is the semi-formal expression of intuition.
A1is engineering, not a science, and as such there is no boundary tonatural language; one counter example does not overthrow a rule sys-tem.

A plan is the internalrepresentation or set of beliefs about how a particular goal may beachieved.
The belief by an observer that an actor performed oneact to enable a second to be performed can follow neither from deduc-tive nor inductive reasoning.
An observer may have other propositionsthat are reasons for believing or nut believing that a plan correctlycharacterizes the beliefs of the actor.
An act name organizes a setof beliefs about how a move of this type might relate to other moves,and the cognitive and motivational statea of the actors.ProqsammingSTRING AND LIST PROCESS I NG IN SNOBOL4: TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONSRalph E.

It also hasa flexible function definition facility and programmer-defined data types.
Whilenot unique, these two features encourage problem-dependent extensions of thelanguage.
.
All ?
b e e  aspects of SNOBOLA fom the basic tools in Griswold's newbookIntended as  a text  for the SNC1BON user (it i s  not an "introductoryt' text) ,it presents techniques for the representation and manipulation of data in string,list, or  otherwise "structured" fm.
The text includes m y  programed examples,problems with a wide range of difficulty, and answers t o  m y  of these problems.The first Shree chapters develop pattern matching, function definition, and datas-tructures.
The l a s t  four chapteFs examine particular application domiins: mthe-mt ics ,  cryptography, document ~ r p a r - ~ o r  , Plus a f e w  more specialized problems.Although th i s  m y  seem tb ignore c q u t a t i o n a l  linguistics, the greatest imnediatebenefit fo r  the pmgranurter l i e s  in the fFrst  t h e  chapters anyway.Within C h a p  1, the section on g r a m w s  and patterns can be used for  theinIplemntation of simple syntactic analysis.
For exaqle, there is a straight-forward mpping of a BNf g~mmar into SNOBON patterns, but there are pi t fa l l s(as well a s  scsne more efficient representations in the balance) that the programerought t o  know.
These are  c'arefully explained.A topic that I f e l t  was inadequately covered in Chapter 1 was the definitionof the pattern mtching mechanism i t se l f .
The immediate presentation of examplesusing pattern rratchhg (page 2)  calls  for a brief overview of pattern mtchhgsyntax and seman-tics.
Surely a progrwnnw?
muld appreciate not having t o  referback t o  his in.troductory text should some p a t t e n  function or construct bebhazyin his memory.
Even an appendix wuld be satisfactory.
In addition, th is  wouldsupport the section on p t t e r n s  as  procedures by providing the underlying semanticsfor such tlprocedures.
EUrther incentive for  i t s  inclusion i s  provided by.
theexcellent review of progt-annner-defined data types in Chapter 3.
Why leave patternmtching t o  the userJ.s recollection?The function definition fac i l i ty  discussed in Chapter 2 eraables the constructicof generic functions.
Since there are no data type declarations for  functionargunents or parwters, often only one function i s  required for the execution ofrelated op&ations.on various data types.
The proliferation of functions in acomplex system might therefore be systemtically reduced., The burdeg fa l l s  on theprogrmer, of course, to sort out +he admissible combinatians or appropriateactions.
An addition function for real and cmplex numbers is discussed, wherethe f o m  is a SNOBOL4 primitive and the l a t t e r  i s  constructed from pmgrmer-defined data types.
Although not in the realm of c q u t a t i o w l  linguistics, itdoes have a parallel, for exmple, in a function whi& inserts data into a semanticnetwork and is expected to  handle various chunks of netwmk as well as atomic data.The data type might only be determined.
during p r o p  execution; using a genericfunction avoids distracting logic within the user's primary function.The section on functions as generators is  a l i t t l e  weak from the point ofview of computational linguistic requirements f a  procedures which generate suc-cessive alterna?ives frcmn a complex s-tructure, for  example, sentence parsing orreferent resolution.
The use of sjmple global variables is t m  l M t e d  in thesecontexts; one often heeds to become involved with saving the values of ~ e ~ e r a ll w a l  variables in special data blocks or stacking the decision pints associatedwith alternatives.
The f i r s t  is a well-known compiler-design technique, whileh e  second involves a backbxicking control struc'hxe.
In fact ,  an excellenti l lustrat ion of these ideas would be an implementation of the SfJOBOL4 patternmatohing system in SNOBON.Chapter 3 i s  the m s t  useful because it desmibes how propammer-defineddata types can be used t o  build "sh .u~ tu res~~:  stacks, queues, l h k e d  lists,binary trees, am3 trees.
The sk i l l fu l  user of such representations w i l l  find areduced role for complicated patterm mtchhg expressions because the implicitstructure &coded into a str ing becomes d f e s t  i n  the explicit links of thes h c t u r e .
Not only is there often an economic advantage, but the semmtics ofSNOBOL4-are easier t o  use than the implicit itcMracking semantics of patternmtching.
(Grimold himself p h t s  this out i n  the section on patterns asprocedures.
The prog~mner is encouraged t o  consider economic trade-offs inthe hplemehtation of stcuchuws.
Often overlooked questions are addressed:for  example, the relat ive merits of implementing stacks using s t r i n g s ,  arrays,tables, or defined data types.
Programs for the use or traversal of structuresare also provided.Although exercise 3.40 requests a representation fo r  directed graphs, neitherhint nor answer i s  p v i d e d .
The c a n p u t a t i d  linguist having an h t e r e s t  ins m t i c  networks or similar associative structures is thus lef-t t o  his own exper-t i se .
?he basic -tree representation mst be significantly d i f i e d  t o  incorporatelabelled edges, a nears of eaversal  (search) t h m q h  the edge set, and, of course,non-txee structures.
Gritwold apologizes for not covering every application,6 8but the generality and current popularity of networks fo r  the representation ofknowledge cal ls  for expanded treatment of the topic.Among the appSications covered in de ta i l ,  the ones most relevant to ccsnpu-tat ional  linguistics include a Mndom sentence generator (fm a p r a ~ ~ ~ n a r ) ,  anmcm processor, and (perhaps) a context editor.
The input and output of textualm t e r i a l  is covered in depth undw d6cument prepmt ion  (Chapter 6).
Since thetext  does not delve into computational linguisfics p w  se, the reader (or instruc-tor)  w i l l  dften be called upon t o  map techniques described in the text  onto h i sown problem.
I think that  a g k d  programer muld be able t o  perform this 'trans-formation since solutions are provided fo r  m y  of the basic problems i n  handlinginput text ,  setting up data structures, and traversing these structmes .Before you begin programming your next computational linguistics project, aglance thr"ough th i s  book my save you considerable programing time and rewardyou with usable and f lexible data structures.
Even i f  you do not program inSNOBOL4, the techniques presented here might guide you t o  more eff ic ient  usage ofother languages.
On the other hand, it might convince you t o  try SNOBOLU.ProqrammingF O R T R A N  T E C H N I Q U E SWITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO NON-NUMERI CAL APPLICATIONSA.

Olaf CollegeA practical guide for the occasional Fortran TV programmer tothe basic "tricks" and vocabulary used by the systems programmers.his  boo^ ranges over topics from plotting on a line printer to hash-ing and basic storage structures (stacks, queues, etc.)
using a con-cise, to-the-point writing style.
This style reinforces the statedintention of the book, which is to heLp a programmer with a problemby providing descriptions of non-mathematical techniques.
The styleand intention do limit the usefulness of this book, as some of thetopics would be well known to advanced programmers and are not cov-ered in sufficient depth for such a person.
It is then the area be-tween these two extr'emes to which this book is aimed, and there itcan be of great service.The only important assumption made of the reader is that be knowthe variable types of Fortran (integer, real, Hollerith, etc.)
andtheir attendant foymat specifications.
A good knowledge of characterformats is especially useful, although the major use for them is inoutput statements used in the examples given in the book.
It is alsoassumed that the reader knows the basic Fortran statements, but thisis simple matter as opposed to the format and variable type problemswhich confront a Fortran programmer.The bodk also includes several exercises at the end of eachchapter (answers not supplied unfortunately) and a short but verycomplete bibliography which includes several sources for each chapter.The book's primary value is as a source for Hints to problems encoun-tered during programming, providing an introduction to the'moresophisticated literature which can be found by starting with thebibliography.
This book is therefore a starting point for pickingup a basic vocabulary, techniques, and references for someone who hasjust completed a programming course or who needs a quick introductionto some technique which he may want to look at later in more detail.Computation : Information StructuresI N F O R M A T I O N  S Y S T E M SVOLUME 1 NUMBER 2APRI L 1975Hans-JochenSchneider, Editor-ln-ChiefInstitute fur InformatikUniversitdt StuttgartHerdweg 51D-7000 Stuttgaft 1fFedrep.

At the sensory end, the representation is analog, andpropositional at the cognitive end.
Analog images are incorrectlyseen as having all details of the stimulus whereas quasi-linguisticrepresentations are only partial.

Parametric informa-tion can be coded componentially and explicitly, but some seems tofunction integrally.
It is claimed that structural perception isqualitative whereas parametric perception is quantitative, butstructural elements may have quantitative aspects--its strength ofassociation with different groups.

Attempts to subsume either representation underthe other have not succeeded.
There is a mistaken belief that onlyproofs in Fregean symbolism are rigorous.
Although analogicalrepresentations can sometimes be implemented using Fregean ones,this does not imply that they are not used.M E D I C A L  V O C A B U L A R YPROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH BUFFALO CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS IN MEDICINEOctober 29-31, 1973Published as t h e  Journal of C l i n i c a l  ComputingVolume 3 ,  Number 2, September 1973Editor-In-Chief:E.

ISR-22November 1 9 7 4Discrimination value analysis ranks t e x t  words in accord..ance with how well they are able to discriminare the documents ofa collection from each other.
The value of a term depends on howmuch the average separation between individual documents changeswhen the given term is assigned for content identification.
Thebest words are those which achieve the greatest separation.
Effec-tive criteria are given for assigning each term to either singleword, phrase or word group categories and for constructing optimalindexing vocabularies.
The theory is validated by citing experi-mental results.DocumentationR.

ConcordanceI N D E X  T H O M I S T I C U SSANCTI THOMAE AQUINATIS OPERUM OMNIUM INDICES ET CONCORDANTIAERoberto Busa, S. J.Friedrich Fromann Verlag / Gunther Hol?boog KG, Stuttgart, 1974 -DM 370 per volume, half-leatherA review of volumes 1-10 of the 26-volume Concordantia PrimaFord Lewis BattlesPittsburgh Theological SeminaryIt is appmpriate indeed that, on the seven hundredth anniver-sary of the death of St. Thomas Aquinas, Father Roberto Busa withhis co-workers of the Faculty of Philosophy at the Aloisianum,Gallarate, Italy has begun to publish the long awaited massive con-cordance to his writings and to texts by other authors long assoc-iated with his circle.
For many of us who have done lesser work incomputerized humanistic studies, rumors and reports of Busa's enter-prise aroused our curiosity and, in some cases, led us also to grapplewith the manifold problems of producing a concordance by computer.In studying the specifications and sampling the first ten vol-umes of Index Thomisticus (Seatio 11, Concordantia Prima (A-Initor)) ,this reviewer has been reminded of his own struggle to produce a con-cordance to the Institutes of ~ o h n  Calvin (Pittsburgh, 1972) .
The r .
T.provides a hierarchically organized concordance to a literary corpusof 10,600,000 words of Latin Texts; by comparison, the CaLvin concor-dance contains 405,338 words of Latin text in a single sequence.Thus, the vastly greater literary task of Busa called for a seriesof basic literary and philological and logical declsions not onlyto make the enormous work of processing possible, but also to pro-duce a final instrument for the use of scholars that would ration-ally encompass the vaat corpus.At the outset the character of the Latin language and espec-ially its morphological peculiarities had to be translated into com-puterizable routines, so that something other than a sea of raw a l -phabetical sdrting would result.
Lematization by hand sortingafter the basic concordancing (feasible for a small corpus), prepar-ation of an interlined ("glossed") lemmatized machine readable rext(also suitable for smaller texts), even the elaborated encoding ofthe text developed by De Latte at the Liege Centre - none of thesemethods was chosen by Busa and his associates.
They turned ratherto Forcellini ' s Lexicon tot ius ~ a t i n l h t i s  and encarded the 90,000Forcellini lemmata (in all possible forms) plus additional ones inthe Thornistic corpus to a total of 10,000,000 codes, put this onmagnetic tape, and worked out procedures to apply this Latin MachineDictionary (LEL) to the machine-readable text.
This instrument isnow available fox the use of others working on Latin texts.
To any-one knowing the homographs of Latin, the limitations of any mechan-ical routine are apparent: the T., however, handles these problemsin a clear and workable manner.The size of the literary corpus also called for basic decisionsby successively sequestering different fractions of the corpus (in away that would have doubtless intrigued Thomas himselfl), the com-pilers reduced the mass to manageable proportions.
Their decisionsmay be set down serially.
(1) LITERARY.
First, divide the authentic works ofThomas (100 + 181) from those of other authorship (61):treat each in separate series.
Secondly, extract literalquotations, citations in references to other authors, andcross-citations to other Aquinian treatises; treat thesesepaiately.
This leaves distinct layers of mat'erial forconcor dancing..(2) PHILOLOGICAL.
First, separat.e out indeclinable6like prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs, f o m s  of esse ,helping verbs, e t c .
.
pronouns, numerals, etc., etc ; thesewill occupy a pareiaular concordance.
Second, put the re-maining nouns, adjectives and verbs in a primary concordance:nbuns and adjectives arranged alphabetically by termination;verbs by a standard order.
(3) LOGICAL.
TO reduce the bulk of the concordanceand to make the vacabdlary and context more rationally acces-sible: First, analyze out frequently used phrases (.e.g.,liberum arbitrim, acceptio personarum, caelum e t  terra -there are about 500 of these), concordancing them under oneword only; for example, acceptia personarum would be listedafter all other instances of acceptio.
Secondly, distinguishwords which are either proper names or so commonly foundthat only a brief context (1% lines) need be quoted; therest can then be set in a context of a lines - and the wholeinterfiled in a single series.These decisions have determined both the cnaraccer ana con-tent of Sectio 11, comprising two series (Aquinian and non-Aquin-ian works) of five concordances each.
So much for the Cotlcordanceproper.
There remains a further instrument for the use of schol-ars, Sectio I.
In this are included indices of diseribution, sum-rnarhs of the lexicon, and indLces of frequency: Through theselists linguistic and literary studies of all sorts can be made.By reverse alphabetical ordering of lemmata and forms additional'kinds of analysis are facilitated.
Since these volumes have notyet appeared, they can only be briefly mentioned here.A massive concordance of this type must carry a concise yet:precise location code for each item.
The editors have determinedthe proper modern edition to be used, have set a precise order ofworks to be followed In the concordancing of each type under itsappropriate lemma, and have summarized this on a separate 4-pageinsert, to whidh the user will doubtless make frequent referenceas he learns to use this grand instrument of research.A short review cannot do justice to the immense detail andthe intelligence with which this detail has, with human and com-puter help, been marshalled in the I .
T .
Ea'ther Busa and hisassociates are to be commended not only for their achievement,but: also for the example they have set for other laborers.Future Concordances to comparable literary corpora will obviouslyhave their own special features; yet Busa's method of attackingproblems - linguistic, philological, logical, quantitative - willsuggest analogous modes of approach to others.
While an index toSt.
Thomas by no means exhausts even the whole body of ChristianLatlnity, it provides a key to the heart of Roman theology during8 9its period of greatest fruitfulness and to classical and patristicthought that passed through the schoolmen's filter.
Space elsoprecludes discussion of the physical aspects of concordancing andprinting, f o ~  which Father Busa had the assistance of IBM.In a work of such vast proportiohs, the care of men cannotobviate error.
Some 53 errors have been noted by the compilers inConoordantia Prima.
But even the correction of at least one ofthese contains a minor error: B.O12(QDV)23 13.ag8/8 should readB.012(QDV)22.13.ag8/8.
See Sectio 2 vol- 1, p. 526, co1.2.
Also12.Tabula Syntagmatum, the list of phrases concordanced under onlyone member of the phrase (pp.xiv-xvi) has at least two errors: bonaesteriora should read bona exteriora (p. xiv): drosperitas terrenashould read prosperitas terrena (p. xvi) The most useful pentaglotdescriptive booklet of 46pp.
is somewhat marred in the English ver-sion by misprints and verbal infeliaities.
But these small mattersare quite eclipsed by the enormous accomplishment of Father Busaand his co-workers.Humanities : Concordance[Mbylicbkeiten der maschinellen Verarbeitung spatmittelhochdeutscher Texte.

However the structure at a topical or thematic level maynot be so organized, bearing little resemblance to a deep struc-ture.
Analogies are used, not only in poetry, to transfer largeamounts of information from one domain to another; to enable com-munications of the otherwise.

Foreach cluster, the program printed a mini-concordance to the linesof text containing each word in the cluster.
The results showedtwo types of patterns in the poet's use of words: localized wordplays extendinq over a few lines, and global interactions betweena cluster of words and the overall thematic structure of the text.InstructionCOMPUTER AIDED INSTRUCTIONA BIBLIOGRAPHY WITH ABSTRACTSE.
