As these two morphologically com-plex languages of relaxed word order are gen-erally under-resourced ?
with the topic of de-pendency parsing still largely unaddressed, es-pecially for Serbian ?
we make use of thetwo available dependency treebanks of Croa-tian to produce state-of-the-art parsing modelsfor both languages.
We observe parsing accu-racy on four test sets from two domains.
Wegive insight into overall parser performancefor Croatian and Serbian, impact of prepro-cessing for lemmas and morphosyntactic tagsand influence of selected morphosyntactic fea-tures on parsing accuracy.1 IntroductionCroatian and Serbian are very closely related SouthSlavic languages with complex morphology and rel-atively free word order.
They are mutually intel-ligible with one another, as well as with Bosnianand Montenegrin, amounting for more than 20 mil-lion native speakers.1 Regarding language technol-ogy support, they are considered to be generallyunder-resourced.
More specifically, while a cor-pus of research on processing Croatian and Ser-bian on the morphosyntactic and shallow syntactic1Bekavac et al(2008) provide a corpus-based comparisonof Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian, observing similarities anddifferences in morphology, syntax and semantics.
For furtherinsight regarding Croatian and Serbian morphosyntax, see therespective contemporary grammars (Silic?
and Pranjkovic?, 2005;Stanojc?ic?
and Popovic?, 2008).layer does exist (Tadic?
et al 2012; Vitas et al2012), approaches to full syntactic analysis of thetwo languages were up to this point very sparseand very recent (Agic?
and Merkler, 2013).
As lin-guistic tradition supports dependency-based syntac-tic formalisms for the two languages (Bo?hmova?
etal., 2003; Tadic?, 2007), it should be noted thatthey have not participated in the previous collabo-rative research efforts in dependency parsing, suchas the CoNLL shared tasks (Buchholz and Marsi,2006; Nivre et al 2007).
Furthermore, regardless ofthe specific research topic, the communities dealingwith natural language processing of Croatian, Ser-bian and other closely related languages from theirgroup are still to reach the common level of aware-ness with respect to public availability of their re-search.
Contributions to availability of Croatian andSerbian resources have once again been very fewand recent (Tadic?
and Varadi, 2012), especially forfree culture licensing.Through the line of research we propose here,2 weseek to provide state-of-the-art in dependency pars-ing for both Croatian and Serbian.
In this first groupof experiments, we build on the fact of their closerelatedness by using the two Croatian treebanks ?Croatian Dependency Treebank (Tadic?, 2007) andSETIMES.HR Treebank (Agic?
and Merkler, 2013) ?to build unified parsing models and evaluate themacross the languages and domains.
As we deal withhighly inflectional languages, we also investigatethe influence of morphological preprocessing andmorphosyntactic feature selection on parsing perfor-2This work was partly financed by the EU FP7 STREPproject XLike (FP7-288342).22mance.
We aim to use this first inquiry as a decisionpoint regarding further advancements in resource in-terchangeability in terms of, e.g., annotation projec-tion (Yarowsky et al 2001) and domain adaptation(S?gaard, 2013).
Availability is highly emphasized,as we provide our resources and models to the publicunder the CC-BY-SA-3.0 license.3 We stress the es-sential role of free culture licensing in enabling andmaturing NLP for under-resourced languages.In the following section, we give an overview ofrelated work in computational processing of Croat-ian and Serbian morphology and syntax.
Further, wedefine the experiment objectives and describe the re-sources and experiment workflow.
We elaborate onthe obtained results and conclude by sketching pos-sible future research plans.2 Related workTwo overviews of current state of language technol-ogy development have appeared just recently for thetwo languages we investigate in this paper.The Croatian overview (Tadic?
et al 2012) statesthat a few underperforming shallow parsing proto-types for Croatian do exist (Vuc?kovic?
et al 2008),while deep parsing is left completely unaddressed.In contrast, it indicates that the more basic re-sources ?
manually annotated corpora, inflectionallexicons, lemmatizers, morphosyntactic and namedentity taggers ?
are of higher quality and availability.Most of these are available through META-SHARE(Tadic?
and Varadi, 2012).
However, in terms ofmandatory preprocessing for dependency parsing, tothe best of our knowledge, the only freely avail-able and standard-compliant lemmatization, part-of-speech (POS) or morphosyntactic (MSD) taggingresources are those by (Agic?
et al 2013).4 Theirelaboration contains a more substantial overview ofpreprocessing.
Relevant to our research, these mod-els provide the state of the art in preprocessing forboth Croatian and Serbian.Croatian Dependency Treebank (HOBS) projectwas initiated by (Tadic?, 2007).
However, its suffi-ciency in size increase, followed by the first experi-ments with dependency parsing of Croatian, did notappear soon enough to be included in the CoNLL3http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/4http://nlp.ffzg.hr/resources/models/tagging/shared tasks and the overview of (Tadic?
et al2012).
Preliminary experiments in transition-based(Berovic?
et al 2012) and graph-based parsing havebeen augmented by a hybrid approach which in-cluded integrating a graph-based parser (Hall, 2007)and a valency lexicon (Agic?, 2012).
Due to uncov-ered partial inadequacies of the HOBS formalismat describing certain syntactic properties of Croa-tian, a new line of research was initiated, aimingat creating a more simplistic dependency-based for-malism for data-driven parsing of Croatian (Agic?and Merkler, 2013).
It provided a new freely avail-able dependency treebank, the SETIMES.HR Tree-bank, and derived state-of-the-art dependency pars-ing models.5 On the downside, SETIMES.HR is aprototype with currently less than 2 500 sentencesand a documented need for addressing certain an-notation challenges, such as consistent annotationof complex predicates, an issue that was previouslyobserved and partially resolved in HOBS as well(Berovic?
et al 2012).The overview of Serbian language technologies(Vitas et al 2012) explicitly denotes a satisfac-tory development level for Serbian preprocessingbased on large electronic dictionaries, manually an-notated corpora and hand-crafted transducer gram-mars.
These are available through META-SHARE,even if mostly coupled with restrictive licensing.Further, the overview lists some preliminary re-search in shallow syntactic analysis, while it clearlystates that the absence of a formalised syntax of Ser-bian restricts the development of syntactically anno-tated corpora and thus hinders the research in fullparsing of Serbian, making the creation of a syntac-tic formalism for Serbian a very urgent task.Similar to Croatian, research in Serbian shallowparsing deals exclusively with the manual design ofrule-based modules (Nenadic?, 2000; Nenadic?
et al2003; Vitas et al 2003) in linguistic developmentenviroments such as Intex and NooJ (Silberztein,2004).
We also inquired into a case study on the pos-sibilities of resource transfer from English to Ser-bian (Martinovic?, 2008), only to conclude that itdoes not provide any empirical results.
Hence, tothe best of our knowledge, no experiments in de-pendency treebank construction and data-driven de-5http://nlp.ffzg.hr/resources/corpora/setimes-hr/23pendency parsing ?
or, for that matter, any other ap-proaches to deep syntactic modeling and processing?
currently exist for Serbian.3 Experiment setupIn this section, we present the experimental setup bywhich we aim at subsequently addressing the pre-viously outlined issues with dependency parsing ofCroatian and Serbian.
We define our goals, describethe utilized resources and lay out the workflow.3.1 ObjectivesWe identify the main issues unaddressed by previousresearch in Croatian and Serbian syntactic process-ing and use these to define our research objectives.They are listed here as follows.1.
No empirical research was conducted in de-pendency parsing of Serbian.
Even if this factwas justified by the lack of applied research increating formalisms targeted exclusively at de-scribing syntactic properties of Serbian, we fol-low the underspecification approach that wassuccessfully implemented in HOBS for Croa-tian.
Namely, as the Prague Dependency Tree-bank (PDT) formalism for Czech (Bo?hmova?et al 2003) was altogether ported to Croatianby simply using the PDT annotation manualfor annotating Croatian sentences due to mi-nor differences in syntactic structure betweenCroatian and Czech, we reflect this to theeven greater similarity between Croatian andSerbian on all levels of linguistic description.Hence, we use Croatian data to parse Serbianand to serve as a baseline in Serbian parsing.2.
Using Croatian syntactic models for parsingSerbian text serves to establish the need for ad-vanced approaches to porting resources amonglanguages, such as annotation projection.3.
The best dependency parsing models for Croa-tian are created and tested using a small pro-totype treebank.
SETIMES.HR currently pro-vides state of the art in Croatian dependencyparsing.
To serve our experiment, we enlargeit by 50% by following the annotation guide-lines (Merkler et al 2013) and provide its newversion to the public.4.
Previous experiments were conducted by ten-fold cross-validation on treebank data.
This isa standard approach to dependency parser eval-uation, especially in under-resourced environ-ments.
In this setting, observations are posi-tively biased by text domain and phrase trans-fer due to randomization.
We seek to partiallyaccount for these effects by designing a set oflanguage- and domain-aware test samples.
Bythese we also target at establishing the need fordomain adaptation for parsing.5.
No research was done in investigating the ef-fects of preprocessing and linguistic feature se-lection to dependency parsing for these lan-guages.
As these are highly inflectional, hav-ing very large morphosyntactic tagsets, we seekto inspect the impact of preprocessing choiceson their dependency parsing.
There is am-ple research on the effect preprocessing hason dependency parsing (Goldberg and Elhadad,2009; Mohamed, 2011) and on joint morpho-logical and syntactic processing (Bohnet andNivre, 2012), but none of it included any of theSouth Slavic languages.3.2 WorkflowWe define three batches of experiments to meet theresearch objectives:1. to select the best Croatian dependency formal-ism with respect to its overall parsing accuracyon Croatian and Serbian ?
with an emphasison the most important syntactic categories thatmatch across formalisms ?
and incidentally toestablish the need for annotation projection,2.
to inspect the impact of state-of-the-art auto-matic preprocessing on dependency parsing ofboth languages and3.
to establish the importance of specific Croat-ian and Serbian morphosyntactic features of themost frequent parts of speech in modeling syn-tactic fenomena for dependency parsing.In the first batch, we use HOBS in two instancesand SETIMES.HR to create parsing models and testthem on Croatian and Serbian test samples.
Draw-ing from previous research, we use a standard non-projective graph-based MSTParser generator withsecond-order features (McDonald et al 2006), asthis setting favors Croatian (Agic?, 2012) and re-24lated languages such as Czech and Slovene (Buch-holz and Marsi, 2006).
We are aware of the exis-tence of novel dependency parsers that implementapproaches to handling non-local dependencies andoutperform MSTParser on a set of languages, suchas (Bohnet and Nivre, 2012).
They are not includedhere due to temporal constraints and the fact thatwe were provided with prebuilt MSTParser modelsfor the HOBS instances and needed to ensure theircomparability with SETIMES.HR.
As we mainlydeal with the concept of resource sharing betweenclosely related languages, we assign a more elabo-rated parser selection for future research.For the second batch, we redo the experimentsfrom the first batch in a realistic scenario regard-ing preprocessing.
We use the publicly availablestate-of-the-art tagging and lemmatization modelsfor Croatian and Serbian (Agic?
et al 2013) insteadof manual annotation to observe the incurred ef-fects.
We do both batches for all three formalisms(two HOBS instances and SETIMES.HR) and pro-vide learning curves.The third batch of experiments deals with ob-serving the impact of certain morphosyntactic fea-tures by removing them from training and test data.We inspect all features involved in subspecificationof adjectives, nouns and verbs in compliance withthe Multext East specification (Erjavec, 2012), i.e.,MTE v5 as its fifth release.6In all batches, we observe labeled (LAS) and un-labeled (UAS) attachment scores.
We use approxi-mate randomization for statistical significance test-ing where applicable and meaningful.3.3 TreebanksTwo Croatian dependency treebanks are used in thisexperiment: HOBS (Tadic?, 2007) and SETIMES.HR(Agic?
and Merkler, 2013).HOBS is available in two instances or implemen-tations.
The first one closely follows the PDT anno-tation guidelines (Bo?hmova?
et al 2003) with severaladaptations of predicate annotation (Berovic?
et al2012).
The second one introduces a set of additionalsyntactic tags used for the introduction and subclas-sification of subordinate clauses.

This addition enabled consistency in predicateannotation in clauses and an increase in dependencyparsing accuracy (Agic?
and Merkler, 2013), whiletaking a turn away from the PDT guidelines and to-wards specifics of Croatian syntax.
In the paper,we refer to this instance of HOBS as HOBS + Sub.Both of them are based on Croatian newspaper textand manually preprocessed.
They implement a mor-phosyntactic tagset based on, but slightly deviatedfrom MTE v4 (Erjavec, 2012).
HOBS is availablefrom META-SHARE for research purposes, but itssyntactic tags are stripped from this version.
HOBS+ Sub is not publicly available.
Both have beenmade available to us in whole for conducting thisexperiment, along with prebuilt MSTParser modelscompatible with our experimental settings.SETIMES.HR is based on Croatian newspaper text25from the SETimes parallel corpus.7 It implements asimplistic new formalism (Merkler et al 2013) tar-geting and reaching increased dependency parsingperformance while maintaining the information onthe main syntactic categories and compliance withthe general guidelines for HOBS for these categories(Agic?
and Merkler, 2013).
It is also manually pre-processed, but using the newer MTE v5 morphosyn-tactic tagset.
SETIMES.HR is fully compliant withthis tagset.
As mentioned, it is freely available for allpurposes.
With this in mind, following the annota-tion guidelines, we have expanded its 2 500 sentenceprototype by introducing 1 365 new sentences.Treebank statistics are given in Table 1.
HOBStreebanks are larger than SETIMES.HR by approxi-mately 800 sentences, i.e., 30 thousand tokens (30kw).
The morphosyntactic tagsets also differ, favor-ing SETIMES.HR and MTE v5 by 250 tags if we areto consider the smaller tagset as better in terms ofthe expressivity vs. preprocessing accuracy balanc-ing.
Syntactic tagset of SETIMES.HR has only 15tags.
Tag counts for HOBS treebanks are given bytwo figures: the first one represents the basic tagset,while the second one includes the subclassificationtags.
For example, a coordinated predicate is anno-tated as Pred using the basic tagset and as Pred Coin the full tagset.
Here, we use only the basic tagset.As we anticipated given the properties of Croat-ian syntax, non-projectivity is amply present in bothtreebanks.
Approximately 2% of all dependency re-lations and more than 20% of all sentences are non-projective, supporting our parser selection.As the three treebanks ?
HOBS, HOBS + Sub andSETIMES.HR?
formally do implement different ap-proaches to syntactic modeling, issues may be raisedregarding the comparability of dependency parsingscores.
However, since HOBS and HOBS + Sub areboth based on the PDT formalism and SETIMES.HRimplements a simplistic formalism that is still basedon the PDT and HOBS annotation guidelines andsyntactic tagset reduction (Merkler et al 2013), weconsider the comparison to be valid.
Moreover, allthree formalisms encode the main Croatian syntacticcategories by closely following the general guide-lines for describing the Croatian syntax (Silic?
andPranjkovic?, 2005), thus indicating that comparisons7http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/SETIMES2.phpfor the main syntactic categories ?
such as predi-cates, subjects, objects, prepositional and adverbialphrases ?
should hold true for the task of depen-dency parsing irregardless of the formal differencesbetween the models.3.4 Test setsThe publicly available test sets are obtained from anexperiment in lemmatization and tagging of Croat-ian and Serbian (Agic?
et al 2013).
They were avail-able in MTE v4 and v5.
As HOBS uses the formerand SETIMES.HR the latter tagset, they were well-suited for our experiment.
We syntactically anno-tated the test sets threefold, i.e., by using the HOBS,HOBS + Sub and SETIMES.HR formalisms.
Thereare four test samples: Croatian and Serbian paral-lel sentences from newspaper sources (set.test) andWikipedia (wiki.test).
Their suitability for testingmodels on closely related languages was thoroughlyelaborated by (Agic?
et al 2013), where their dif-ferences were measured by using inflectional lexi-cons of Croatian and Serbian and were found to besignificant in supporting the difference between thelanguages.
Namely, lexical coverage differed by ap-proximately 10 percentage points in favor of Croat-ian across the two domains.Statistics for the test set are given in Table 2.
Eachsample has 100 sentences or approximately 2 000tokens.
Slight variations in token, type and lemmacounts are present and reflect the domain differ-ences.
MSD tag and syntactic tag counts reflect therespective formalisms, as not all HOBS and HOBS+ Sub syntactic tags are utilized, while all 15 SE-TIMES.HR tags are present in all the samples.
HOBStag counts are once again given separately for thebasic and the full tagset, while only the basic subsetwas used in the experiment.Inter-annotator agreement for HOBS, HOBS +Sub and SETIMES.HR is investigated in (Agic?
andMerkler, 2013).
It favors SETIMES.HR over HOBS+ Sub and HOBS + Sub over HOBS with a statis-tically significant difference.
The CoNLL sharedtasks in dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi,2006; Nivre et al 2007) used test sets of approx-imately 5 000 tokens.
This may raise an issue re-garding the relatively small size of our domain testsamples.
However, in the experiment, we combinethe test sets by domain and by language and also26set.test wiki.testLAS hr sr hr sr overallHOBS 59.9 58.7 55.5 55.4 57.6HOBS + Sub 68.3 66.9 62.4 62.7 65.3SETIMES.HR 76.7 75.4 71.9 72.4 74.3UASHOBS 73.7 75.9 72.3 72.6 73.8HOBS + Sub 78.1 79.0 76.5 76.5 77.6SETIMES.HR 81.6 80.6 80.0 80.6 80.8Table 3: Parsing accuracy (LAS, UAS) with manual pre-processing.
Results are given for each test set and overall,i.e., with all four test sets merged into one.merge them into a single test set, thus accountingfor the size of the individual samples.3.5 Parser setupHere we use MSTParser with the non-projectivemaximum spanning tree parsing algorithm and sec-ond order features (decode-type:non-projorder:2 training-k:5 iters:10), as itwas previously established as the optimal set-ting for parsing Croatian using MSTParser (Agic?,2012) with a statistically significant margin overthe transition-based approach.
In training and test-ing, we separate the MTE v5 MSD tags into POS(CPOSTAG) and full MSD (POSTAG).
We do notseparate the MSD tags into atomic features, i.e., wedo not utilize the FEATS column of the CoNLL-Xformat.
Thus the MSD tags themselves are consid-ered as atomic features in the experiment, both forthe full MTE v5 tagset and its reductions.4 Results and discussionHere we report and discuss the obtained results.
Wediscuss the results in batches, as in the experimentworkflow description.
In addition, we give a brieflinguistic analysis of the parsing errors consideringthe difference between the two languages and thefact that Croatian models were used for parsing bothCroatian and Serbian text.4.1 Formalism selectionIn the first experiment batch, we trained the parsingmodels using three treebanks, HOBS, HOBS + Suband SETIMES.HR, and tested them on our Croatianand Serbian test sets from Wikipedia and newspa-per text.
We present the overall scores in Table 3,the learning curves are plotted in the first diagramof Figure 1 and the accuracy for selected syntacticcategories are given in Table 4.Regarding the formalism selection process, in-specting the overall observed LAS and UAS, it isevident that models based on SETIMES.HR outper-form HOBS-based models by a large margin.
Theyoutperform HOBS + Sub by approximately 9 LASand 3 UAS points, while their overall advantage iseven more substantial in comparison with the scoresof basic HOBS models ?
approximately 17 LASand 7 UAS points.
Benefits of explicit annotationof predicates by introducing tags for subordinatingsyntactic conjunctions are also evident as HOBS+ Sub parsers outperform HOBS by 8 LAS and 4UAS points.
These observations maintain the con-clusions about the three formalisms given in previ-ous research (Agic?
and Merkler, 2013).8 Moreover,the introduction of a held-out test set further steep-ens these differences, as the previous tests were per-formed by tenfold cross-validation using treebankdata only.
The observed differences in overall LASand UAS scores are shown to be significant by theapproximate randomization test (p < 0.01).9As stated in the presentation of treebanks in theprevious section, since the three formalisms areclosely related to one another and to the generalguidelines for describing the properties of Croatiandependency syntax, we find this comparison to holdtrue regardless of the formal differences betweenthe models.
Moreover, since the accuracy for thePDT-based formalisms in this and previous experi-ments with Croatian dependency parsing (Agic?
andMerkler, 2013) is below the margins set by similarlanguages such as Czech and Slovene (Buchholz and8Importance of standard compliance should be noted regard-ing the morphosyntactic tagset impact on the observed results.Namely, HOBS ?slightly deviates?
from MTE v4 by design,while still claiming de facto compliance.
As the test sets fullycomply with MTE v4 and v5, this has an effect on parsing.9We test by randomly (prob = 0.5) inserting alternate syn-tactic annotations for entire test set sentences and evaluatingwith respect to annotation style, i.e., selecting to match the sen-tence annotations against HOBS, HOBS + Sub or SETIMES.HRlayer in the gold standard annotation.27Figure 1: Labeled attachment learning curves for the three treebanks using gold standard and automatic lemmatizationand morphosyntactic taggingMarsi, 2006)10, we argue that HOBS requires thor-ough further revision if it is to be the Croatian coun-terpart of PDT in terms of expressivity and usabilityin research and practical applications.
This is furthersupported by the data in Table 4, where the assign-ment of specific syntactic tags is explored.
However,extrinsic evaluation would also be beneficial.The differences in LAS and UAS scores betweenthe two languages are virtually non-existent acrossformalisms and domains.
The parsing models fa-vor Croatian newspaper text by less than 2 LASpoints for all three formalisms, while UAS is ap-proximately 1 UAS point higher in Serbian newspa-per text for HOBS and HOBS + Sub, in contrast withSETIMES.HR, which scores 1 UAS point higher forthe Croatian sample.
In the Wikipedia samples, LASand UAS may be approximated as identical.
In total,as a top-performer, the SETIMES.HR model scored74.5 LAS and 80.9 UAS on Croatian samples and74.1 LAS and 80.6 UAS on Serbian samples.
We be-lieve this indicates that the parsing models trained onCroatian treebank data can be used reliably for bothCroatian and Serbian text.
We also use these figuresto imply no need for syntactic annotation projectionbetween Croatian and Serbian in this test scenario.The cross-domain differences in LAS and UASare, in contrast with the cross-language differences,10This holds even with the Slovene treebank of the CoNLL2006 shared task having more than 2 000 sentences less thanHOBS, with both using the PDT formalismmuch more substantial.
As all treebanks were builton top of Croatian newspaper text, scores are ex-pectedly higher for these test samples in comparisonwith the Wikipedia samples?
scores.
This differenceamounts to approximately 5 LAS points and 2 UASpoints in favor of the newspaper text samples acrossthe two languages and three formalisms.We plotted the LAS learning curves by mergingthe test samples into a single mixed-language testset, incrementally creating 8 parsing models per for-malism (12.5% to 100% of full size) and testingthem on this merged test set.
The left plot of Figure 1represents the learning curves for the three treebankspeaking at previously discussed scores from Table 3.The curves clearly reflect the overall differences inscores.
Their rate of increase is consistently com-parable, with the overall difference in favor of SE-TIMES.HR due to its smaller yet still informativesyntactic tagset and its formalism better suited forCroatian syntax.
With this fact now once againempirically supported, we select the top-performingSETIMES.HR parsing model for further inspection.Thus, our further discussion deals exclusively withparsing using SETIMES.HR.First we observe parsing accuracy regarding syn-tactic categories, where we still do compare SE-TIMES.HR with HOBS + Sub as a final referencepoint.

SE-TIMES.HR substantially outperforms HOBS + Subon the most frequent and arguably the most infor-mative categories, such as predicate and subject (atleast 5 LAS points), object (almost 20 LAS points)and attribute (6 points LAS).4.2 Preprocessing and featuresHere we discuss the impact of automatic preprocess-ing, i.e., lemmatization and MSD tagging on depen-dency parsing in our test framework.
As announced,this discussion deals exclusively with SETIMES.HR.We lemmatize and tag the test samples by usingfreely available state-of-the-art models for Croatianand Serbian (Agic?
et al 2013), parse them usingour best SETIMES.HR model and observe LAS andUAS.

Thesecond plot of Figure 1 provides the learning curvesfor the automatically preprocessed test sets.Table 6 scores are easily elaborated using the pre-viously discussed scores with manual, i.e., gold orperfect preprocessing.
Namely, the impact of differ-ences between manual and automatic preprocessingon parsing quality basically amounts to a very sim-ple formula: LAS is reduced by 3-4 points and UASby 2 points when introducing preprocessing noiseby automatic lemmatization and tagging.
This ob-servation is valid across the languages and domainsof our test set and thus applies generally.
Keepingin mind the more complex prospective NLP systemsfor Croatian and Serbian, we consider this fact tobe very favorable as the observed 16% error rate infull MSD tagging, 5-6% for POS and lemmatization,amounts for a significantly smaller decrease in pars-ing quality as quantified by LAS and UAS.To further support this observation, we conductedan experiment with purposely corrupting lemmatiza-tion and tagging.
In this, as previously for learningcurves, we use the single merged test sample.
Forlemmatization, we randomly drop lemmas from themanually annotated test sample, replacing them withempty features.11 For MSD tagging, we implementtwo procedures.
The first is identical with the one forlemmatization, while in the second we replace thevalid tag with a randomly selected Croatian tag fromthe full MTE v5 morphosyntactic tagset.
For each11In terms of the CoNLL-X format, we simply replace thevalid entry from the LEMMA field by an underscore.29Croatian SerbianFeatures LAS UAS LAS UASAdjectiveType 74.3 80.7 74.6 81.2Degree 74.3 80.7 73.7 80.2Gender 74.1 80.7 74.5 81.0Number 74.5 81.0 74.3 80.8Case 75.0 81.5 74.4 81.1NounType 74.3 80.8 72.9 80.0Gender 74.4 80.8 74.1 80.7Number 74.1 80.7 74.0 80.7Case 73.3 81.0 72.3 80.0VerbType 74.6 81.3 74.3 80.8Form 74.3 80.9 74.3 81.0Person 74.3 81.0 73.5 80.0Number 74.4 80.8 74.1 80.6Gender 74.4 80.8 74.4 81.0Full feature set 74.5 80.9 74.1 80.6Table 7: Impact of morphosyntactic feature exclusion onparsing.
Improvements boldfaced and split by language.of these scenarios, we provide 11 test sets: step-ping by 10% of removals or random insertions, from0% to 100% preprocessing accuracy.
The resultsare plotted in Figure 2.
Evidently, lemmatizationis of no influence to dependency parsing using ourmodel.
This is an important observation to considerin, e.g., the future tasks of parsing large web cor-pora of Croatian and Serbian.
The large impact ofmorphosyntactic tagging, i.e., morphosyntactic fea-tures on parsing is also evident from the figure.
Itis also supported by previous research in parsing us-ing SETIMES.HR (Agic?
and Merkler, 2013), wherea significant bias towards MSD-based parsing mod-els was found over the POS-only-based models.
Tagremoval and tag randomization appear to induce avery similar effect of near-linear functional depen-dency between tagging and parsing.
We note thatthis is not entirely supported by our realistic prepro-cessing test scenario.
It is purely due to the fact thatour noise introduction procedure does not relate tothe modus in which the stochastic tagger errs in pro-cessing unseen text.
Namely, MSD tagging errorsFigure 2: Overall SETIMES.HR parsing accuracy in rela-tion with lemmatization and morphosyntactic taggingtend to occur on certain morphosyntactic features,corrupting these much more often than entire tags.Thus, even when it yields a feature error, the taggerstill provides the parser with other valid features towork with.
This consideration of MSD features, inpair with the following set of results, sketches ourplans for further research.Following the previous note on MSD tagset andfeatures, we also implemented a simple experimentin feature weight assessment.
In it, we used the SE-TIMES.HR treebank with full MTE v5 tagset andcreated from it several instances, each with its ownreduced MTE v5 tagset.
Each reduction was de-fined by dropping one MSD feature from one partof speech.
More precisely, we dropped all MSDfeatures of adjectives (5 features), nouns (4) andverbs (5).
This amounted at 14 different MTE v5reductions.
We trained 14 parsing models using SE-TIMES.HR with the reduced tagsets and tested themon the test samples merged by language and imple-menting the respective tagset reductions.The results are given in Table 7.
Most notably,we observed an increase in parsing accuracy whendropping adjective case and verb type.
The mostsubstantial decrease occurred with the removal ofnoun case, indicating the importance of this featurein parsing the two languages.
We consider the ad-jective case removal gain an important observationfor future work, as adjectives are the most difficultly30Adv Ap Atr Atv Aux Co Elp Obj Oth Pnom Pred Prep Punc Sb SubAdv 0 15 1 0 2 2 5 13 2 1 3 0 2 2Ap 1 10 0 0 0 2 3 0 1 0 0 0 5 0Atr 23 9 6 1 0 14 23 3 3 3 0 0 25 2Atv 0 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 26 0 0 1 0Aux 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 28 0 0 0 1Co 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 11 0 0Elp 1 2 12 0 0 0 0 4 3 2 0 0 4 0Obj 6 3 16 3 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 2 0Oth 14 4 3 0 0 12 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 24Pnom 3 0 8 0 0 0 3 0 0 24 1 0 3 0Pred 1 0 2 5 26 0 0 1 1 23 0 0 0 0Prep 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0Punc 0 0 0 0 0 17 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1Sb 2 11 26 1 0 0 5 1 4 4 1 0 0 1Sub 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0Table 8: Confusion matrices for LAS (Croatian: bottom left, Serbian: top right)tagged category for Croatian and Serbian.4.3 Error analysisHere we provide a brief insight to the error instances.We discuss LAS errors for both languages, i.e., in-stances of invalid head attachments paired with tagmisassignments.
These are given in Table 8 in theform of two confusion matrices for LAS.We isolate several clusters of errors with sharedlinguistic properties.
Firstly, the subject-attribute-apposition group (Sb-Atr-Ap), in which we findthe error instances to be closely related to the or-der of attachment and assignment in multi-wordunits representing foreign personal names, titles orfunctions and occupations of persons.
Next, theattribute-adverb-object group (Atr-Adv-Obj) expect-edly appears as these are inherently ambiguous cat-egories.12 The predicate-nominal-auxiliary group oferrors (Pred-Pnom-Aux) reflects the interaction ofMSD annotation choices and syntactic annotationprinciples, as participes are MSD-tagged as adjec-tives, thus confusing the parser in predicate annota-tion.
Moreover, SETIMES.HR has documented is-sues with consistency in complex predicate anno-tation that seek resolution and negatively influencethe parsing scores.
Lastly, the only error group sub-stantially reflecting the language difference is theone involving predicates and predicate complements(Pred-Atv), as it appears only in the Serbian confu-sions.
Namely, the infinitive predicate complementis frequent in Croatian and non-existent in Serbian.Infinitives in Serbian only appear for the future tensepaired with auxiliary verbs, confusing the parser to12PDT, e.g., has an AtrAdv, AdvAtr, AtrObj and ObjAtr am-biguity classes to address this.
However, the sum of their fre-quencies in HOBS is negligibly small (< 0.03%).annotate these infinitives as predicate complementsas observed in the Croatian training data.5 Conclusions and future workWe have described an experiment with dependencyparsing of two closely related and under-resourcedlanguages, Croatian and Serbian, by using parsingmodels trained on Croatian treebanks.
We investi-gated three different parsing formalisms, the effectsof lemmatization, morphosyntactic tagging and fea-ture selection on parsing quality for both languages.We observed state-of-the-art parsing scores.
All re-sources used in the experiment are made publiclyavailable under a permissive license.13The results of this experiment sketch the path forour future research.
Experiments with syntactic pro-jection between Croatian and Serbian are not feasi-ble given the negligible differences in the observedscores.
In contrast, domain adaptation for pars-ing the two languages should be investigated giventhe observed accuracy decrease when moving fromnewspaper text to Wikipedia.
We have already initi-ated further enlargements of the SETIMES.HR tree-bank and the test sets with Croatian data from otherdomains.
Experiments with newer and more ad-vanced dependency parsers (Koo and Collins, 2010;Bohnet and Nivre, 2012; Zhang and McDonald,2012; Martins et al 2013) should be conducted toprovide up-to-date scores.We are currently experimenting with morphosyn-tactic tagset design for improved dependency pars-ing of Croatian and Serbian.
We aim at finding theoptimal tagset by closely investigating morphosyn-tactic feature influences and dependencies.13http://nlp.ffzg.hr/31ReferencesZ?.
