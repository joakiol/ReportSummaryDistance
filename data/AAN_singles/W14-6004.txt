of inventions.
As in aspect-based sentiment analysis, we focus on identify-ing not only the components of products but also the attributes and tasks which, in the case of patents,serve to justify an invention?s utility.
These semantic roles (component, task, attribute) can serve as ahigh level ontology for categorizing domain terminology, within which the positive/negative polarity ofattributes serves to identify technical goals and obstacles.
We show that bootstrapping using a verysmall set of domain-independent lexico-syntactic features may be sufficient for constructing domain-specific classifiers capable of assigning semantic roles and polarity to terms in domains as diverse ascomputer science and health.1 IntroductionAutomated data mining of patents has had a long history of research, driven by the large volume ofpatents produced each year and the many tasks to which they are put to use, including prior art inves-tigation, competitive analysis, and trend detection and forecasting (Tseng, 2007).
Much of this workhas concentrated on bibliographic methods such as citation analysis, but text mining has also beenwidely explored as a way to assist analysts to characterize patents, discover relationships, and facilitatepatent searches.
One of the indicators of new technology emergence is the coinage, adoption andspread of new terms; hence the identification and tracking of technical terminology over time is of par-ticular interest to researchers designing tools to support analysts engaged in technology forecasting(e.g., Woon, 2009; deMiranda, 2006)For the most part, research into terminology extraction has either (1) focused on the identification ofkeywords within individual patents or corpora without regard to the roles played by the keywordswithin the text (e.g., Sheremetyeva, 2009) or, (2) engaged in fine-grained analysis of the semantics ofnarrow domains (e.g., Yang, 2008).
In this paper we strive towards a middle ground, using a high-level classification suitable for all domains, inspired in part by recent work on sentiment analysis (Liu,2012).
In aspect-based sentiment analysis, natural language reviews of specific target entities, such asrestaurants or cameras, are analyzed to extract aspects, i.e., features of the target entities, along withthe sentiment expressed toward those features.
In the restaurant domain, for example, aspects mightinclude the breadth of the menu, quality of the service, preparation of the food, and cost.
Aspects thustend to capture the tasks that the entity is expected to perform and various dimensions and componentsrelated to those tasks.
Sentiment reflects the reviewer?s assessment of these aspects on a scale fromnegative to positive.A patent application is required by definition to do three things: describe an invention, argue for itsnovelty, and justify its utility.
The utility of a patent is typically defined by the accomplishment of anew task or an improvement to some existing task along one or more dimensions.
Thus, a patent canbe thought of as a positive review of a product with respect to specific aspects of its task(s).
Indeed,the most commonly occurring verbs in patents include those indicative of components (?comprise?,?include?
), attributes (?increase?, ?reduce?
), and tasks (?achieve?, ?perform?).
Organizing keywordsalong these high-level distinctions, then, would allow patent analysts to explore terminological infor-This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Furthermore, given the interpretation of a patentas a positive review, it should be possible to identify the default polarity of measurable aspects in thecontext of a domain.
For example, if a patent makes a reference to increasing network bandwidth,then this should lend support to the notion that network bandwidth is not only a relevant attribute with-in the patent?s domain but also a positive one.
Likewise, if a patent refers to reducing power con-sumption, then we might interpret power consumption as an aspect with negative polarity.
For ana-lysts trying to assess trends within a technology domain, tracking the occurrences of terms signifyingtasks and attributes, along with their polarity, could help them characterize the changing goals and ob-stacles for inventors over time.The US patent office receives over half a million patent applications a year.1  These are classified bysubject matter within several standardized hierarchical schemes, which permits dividing up the corpusof patents both by application date and subfield (e.g., computer science, health, chemistry).
Since ourgoal is to support analysts across all domains, it is highly desirable to extract domain-specific aspectsthrough semi-supervised machine learning rather than incur the cost of domain-specific knowledgeengineering.
To this end, we employed a bootstrapping approach in which a small number of domainindependent features was used to generate a much larger number of domain dependent features forclassification.
We then applied na?ve Bayes classification in a two-step classification process: firstdistinguishing attributes, components and tasks; and then classifying the extracted attribute terms bytheir polarity.The paper is structured as follows.
In section 2, we describe the system architecture.
Section 3shows results for two domains (computer science and health).
In section 4, we present an evaluationof results and discuss issues and shortcomings of the current implementation.
In section 5, we presentrelated research and in section 6, our conclusions and directions for future work.2 System architecture2.1 Corpus processingOur patent collection is a set of 7,101,711 US patents in XML-markup form from Lexis-Nexis.
Wedivided the collection into subcorpora by application year and high-level domain using the patents?classification within the USPTO hierarchy.
The XML markup was then used to extract the relevantportions of patents for further analysis.
These sections included title, abstract, background, summary,description and claims.
References, other than those embedded in the sections above, were omitted, asthey contain many entity types (people, publications, and organizations) that are not particularly usefulfor our current task.
The text of each section was extracted and broken into sentences by the Stanfordtagger (Toutanova, 2003) which also tokenized and tagged each token with a part of speech tag.We then chunked adjacent tokens into simple noun phrase chunks of the form (ADJECTIVE)?
(NOUN)* NOUN.2  We will hereafter refer to these chunks as terms.
The majority of these patentterms fall into one of three major categories:Components: the physical constituents or processes that make up an invention, as well as the ob-jects impacted, produced by or used in the invention.Tasks: the activities which inventions, their components or beneficiaries perform or undergo.Attributes: the measureable dimensions of tasks and components mentioned in the patent.To generate features suitable for machine learning of these semantic categories, we used a small setof lexico-syntactic relationships, each defined with respect to the location of the term in a sentence:prev_V: the closest token tagged as a verb appearing to the left of the term, along with any preposi-tions or particles in between.
(cached_in, prioritizing, deal_with)prev_VNpr: a construction of the form <verb><NP><prep> appearing to the left of the term.
Onlythe head noun in the NP is retained (inform|user|of, provides|list|of, causes|increase|in)prev_Npr: a construction of the form <noun><prep> appearing to the left of the term.
(re-striction_on, applicability_of, time_with)1 http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/us_stat.htm2 We blocked a set of 246 general adjectival modifiers (e.g., other, suitable, preferred, entire, initial,?)
from participating interms.32prev_Jpr: a construction of form <adjective> <prep> appearing to the left of the term.
(free_from,desirable_in, unfamiliar_with)prev_J: a construction of form <adjective> <prep> appearing to the left of the term.
(excessive, con-siderable, easy)These features were designed to capture specific dependency relations between the term and its pre-modifiers and dominant verbs, nouns, and adjective phrases.
We extracted the features using localizedrules rather than create a full dependency parse.3  One additional feature internal to the term itself wasalso included: last_word.
This simply captured the head term of the noun phrase, which often carriesgeneralizable semantic information about the phrase.
Each feature instance was represented as a stringcomprising a prefix (the feature type) and its value (a token or concatenation of tokens).2.2 ClassificationFor each term appearing in a subcorpus, the collection of co-occurring features across all documentswas assembled into a single weighted feature vector in which the weight captured the number of doc-uments for which the feature occurred in conjunction with the given term.
We also calculated thedocument frequency for each term, as well as its ?domain specificity score?, a metric reflecting therelative frequency of the term in specialized vs. randomized corpora (see section 3).In order to avoid the need to create manually labeled training data for each patent domain, we em-ployed bootstrapping, a form of semi-supervised learning in which a small number of labeled featuresor seed terms are used in an iterative fashion to automaticaly identify other likely diagnostic featuresor category exemplars.
Bootstrapping approaches have previously shown considerable promise in theconstruction of semantic lexicons (Riloff, 1999; Thelen, 2002, Ziering, 2013).
By surveying commonprev_V features in a domain-independent patent subcorpus, we selected a small set of domain-independent diagnostic lexico-syntactic features (?seed features?)
that we felt were strong indicatorsfor each of the three semantic categories.
The set of seed features for each category is shown below.Semantically equivalent inflectional variants were also included as features.Attribute: improve, optimize, increase, decrease, reduceComponent: comprise, contain, encompass, incorporate, use, utilize, consist_of, assembled_of, com-posed_ofTask: accomplish, achieve, enhance, facilitate, assisting_in, employed_in, encounter_in, perform,used_for, utilized_forWe then utilized these manually labeled generic features to bootstrap larger feature sets F for do-main-specific subcorpora.
For each term t in a domain-specific subcorpus, we extracted all the manu-ally labeled features that the term co-ocurred with.
Any term which co-occurred with at least two la-beled feature instances and for which all of its labeled features were of the same class was itself la-beled with that class for subsequent use as a seed term s for estimating the parameters of a multinomialna?ve Bayes classifier (Manning et al, 2008).
Each seed term so selected was represented as a bag ofits co-occurring features.The prior probability of each class and conditional probabilities of each feature given the class wereestimated as follows, using Laplace ?add one?
smoothing to eliminate 0 probabilities:?

(   )(   )( )3 The compute time required to produce dependency parses for the quantity of data to be analyzed led to the choice of a?leaner?
feature extraction method.33where    is the set of seed terms with class label j, S is the set of all seed terms, count(f,c) is the countof co-occurrences of feature f with seed terms in class c, count(c) is the total number of feature co-occurrences with seed terms in class c, and F is the set of all features (used for Laplace smoothing).Using the na?ve Bayes conditional independence assumption, the class of each term in a subcorpuswas then computed by maximizing the product of the prior probability for a class and the product ofthe conditional probabilities of the term?s features:( ) ?
(   )Terms for which no diagnostic features existed were labeled as ?unknown?.Once the terms in a subcorpus were categorized as attribute, component, or task, the terms identi-fied as attributes were selected as input to a second round of classification.4  We used the same boot-strapping process as described for the first round, choosing a small set of features highly diagnostic ofthe polarity of attributes.
For positive polarity, the seed features were: increase, raise, maximize.
Fornegative polarity: avoid, lower, decrease, deal_with, eliminate, minimize, reduce, resulting_from,caused_by.
Based on co-occurrence with these features, a set of terms was produced from which pa-rameters for a larger set of features could be estimated, as described above.
We then used na?ve Bayesclassification to label the full set of attribute terms.3 ResultsWe present results from two domains, health and computer science, using a corpus consisting of allUS patent applications submitted in the year 2002.
The health subcorpus consisted of 19,800 docu-ments, while the computer science subcorpus contained 51,058 documents.
A ?generic?
corpus com-posed of 38,482 patents randomly selected from all domains was also constructed for the year for usein computing a ?domain specificity score?.
This score was designed to measure the degree to which aterm could be considered part of a specific domain?s vocabulary and was computed as thelog(probability of term in domain corpus / probability of term in generic corpus).
For example, incomputer science, the term encryption technology earned a domain specificity score of 4.132, whilespeed earned .783 and color garnered .022.
Using a combination of term frequency (# of documents aterm occurs in within a domain) thresholds and domain specificity, one can extract subsets of termswith varying degrees of relevance within a collection.53.1 Attribute/Component/Task (ACT) ClassificationThe bootstrapping process generated 1,644 features for use in the health domain and 3,200 in com-puter science.
Kullback-Leibler divergence is a commonly used metric for comparing the differencebetween two probability distributions (Kullback and Leibler, 1951).
By computing Kullback-Leiblerdivergence    (    ) between the distribution P of classes predicted by each feature (i.e., the proba-bility of the class given the feature alone based on the term seed set labels) and the prior class distribu-tion Q, we could estimate the impact of individual features in the model.
Table 1 shows some of thedomain-specific features in the health and computer science domains, along with the category eachtended to select for.6Using the features generated by bootstrapping, the classifier was able to label 61% of the 1,335,240terms in health and 81% of the 1,391,402 terms in computer science.
The majority of unlabeled termswere extremely low frequency (typically 1).
Higher frequency unlabeled terms were typically fromcategories other than those under consideration here (e.g., john wiley, j. biochem, 2nd edition).
Thedistribution of category labels for the health and computer domains is shown in Table 2.4 We found relatively little evidence of explicit sentiment targeted at component and task aspects in patents and thereforefocused our polarity analysis on attributes.5 Similar to Velardi?s use of ?domain relevance?
and ?consensus?
(Velardi, 2001).6 Although it is possible to use KL-Divergence for feature selection, it is applied here solely for diagnostic purposes to verifythat feature distributions match our intuitions with respect to the classification scheme.34Table 1.

When terms were ranked by frequency, given a relatively relaxed domain specificity threshold(e.g., .05 for health), the top terms tended to capture broad semantic types relevant to the domain.
Asthis threshold was increased (e.g., to 1.0 for health), the terms increased in specialization within eachclass.7 As the table entries show, while the classification is not perfect, most terms fit the definitions oftheir respective classes.
Note that in the health domain in particular, many of the ?components?
reflectobjects acted upon by the invention, not just constituents of inventions themselves.
Symptoms anddiseases are interpreted as attributes because they are often measured according to severity and aretargets for reduction.Table 3a.

In the future, we plan to compensate directly for these size disparities in the score computation.35Table 3b.

While not all the system labeled attributes merited theirdesignation as attributes, the large quantity so labeled in each domain illustrates the vast number ofconditions and dimensions for which inventions are striving to ?move the needle?
one way or the oth-er, relative to attributes in the domain.
Examples of the system?s polarity decisions are shown in Ta-ble 4.
The system?s labels suggest that the default polarity of attributes in both domains is nearlyevenly split.Table 4.

Using a frequency threshold of10 this yielded 19,088 terms for the health corpus and 35,220 for computer science with domain speci-ficity scores above .05 and 1.5 respectively.
For each domain, two judges annotated approximately150 random term instances with ACT judgments and approximately 100 machine-labeled attributes forpolarity.
The annotation tool displayed each term along with five random sentences from the corpusthat contained the term, and asked the judge to choose the best label, given the contexts provided.
An36?other?
option was available if the term fit none of the target categories.
For the polarity task, the?other?
label included cases where the attribute was neutral, could not be assigned a polarity, or wasimproperly assigned the category ?attribute?.
An adjudicated gold standard was compared to systemlabels to measure precision and recall, as shown in table 5.Table 5a.

The lower scores for tasks withinthe ACT classification may reflect the fact that the distinction between component and task is not al-ways clear cut.
The term ?antivirus protection?, for example, describes a task but it is classified by thesystem as a component because it occurs with features like ?prev_V=distribute?
and?prev_V=provided_with?, which outweigh the contribution of the feature ?last_word=protection?
toselect for the type task.
To capture such cases of role ambiguity, it may be reasonable to assign someterms to multiple classes when the conditional probabilities for the two most probable classes are veryclose (as they are in this case).
It may also be possible to integrate other forms of evidence, such assyntactic coordination patterns (Zierning, 2013) to refine system decisions.One shortcoming of the current polarity classifier is that it does not attempt to identify attributes forwhich the polarity is neutral or dependent upon further context within the domain.
For example, theattribute ?body weight gain?
is labeled as a negative.
However, in the context of premature birth orcancer recovery, it may be actually be a positive attribute.
Testing whether an attribute co-occurs withconflicting features (e.g., prev_V=increase and prev_V=decrease) could help spot such cases.5 Related workText mining from patents has focused on identifying domain keywords and terminology for analyt-ics (Tseng, 2007).
Velardi?s (2001) approach, using statistics to determine domain relevance and con-sensus is very similar to that adopted here.
We have also drawn inspiration from sentiment analysis,proposing an ontology for patents that reflects their review-like qualities (Liu, 2012).
Most relevant isthe work on discovering aspects and opinions relating to a particular subject such as a camera or res-taurant (Kobayashi, 2007).
There are many subtleties that have been studied in opinion mining re-search that we have finessed in our research here, such as detecting implicit sentiment and attributesnot expressed as noun phrases.
Wilson et al (2005, 2009) addressed the larger problem of determiningcontextual polarity for subjective expressions in general, putting considerable effort into the compila-tion of subjectivity clues and annotations.
In contrast, our aim was to test whether we could substan-tially reduce the annotation effort when the task is focused on polarity labeling of attributes within pa-tents.
We hypothesized that the specialized role of patents might permit a more lightweight approachamenable to bootstrapping from a very small set of annotations and feature types.37Bootstrapping has been successfully applied to developing semantic lexicons containing a variety ofconcept types (Riloff, 1999; Thelen, 2002).
It is often applied iteratively to learn new discriminativefeatures after a set of high probability categorized terms are identified during an earlier round.
Whilethis increases recall, it also runs the risk of semantic drift if some terms are erroneously labeled.
Giv-en that the majority of unlabeled terms after a single round in our system are either extremely low fre-quency or not relevant to our ontology, we have not felt a need to run multiple iterations.
Zierning(2013) used bootstrapping to identify instances of the classes substance and disease in patents, exploit-ing the tendency of syntactic coordination to relate noun phrases of the same semantic type.
Given thegeneral nature of coordination, a similar approach could be used to find corroborating evidence for theclassifications that our system produces.6 ConclusionWe have described an approach to text data mining from patents that strikes a middle ground be-tween undifferentiated keywords and rich, domain specific ontologies.
Motivated by the interpretationof patents as ?positive reviews?, we have made use of generic lexico-syntactic features commonacross patent domains to bootstrap domain-specific classifiers capable of organizing terms accordingto their roles as components, tasks and attributes with polarity.
Although the majority of keywords ina domain are categorized as components, the ontology puts tasks and attributes on an equal footingwith components, thereby shifting the emphasis from devices and processes to the goals, obstacles andtargets of inventions, information which could be valuable for analysts attempting to detect trends andmake forecasts.
In addition to more rigorous evaluation and tuning, future research directions includetesting the approach across a wider range of technology domains, incorporation into time series analy-sis for forecasting, and mining relationships between terms from different categories to provide aneven richer terminological landscape for analysts to work with.AcknowledgementsThis research is supported by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) viaDepartment of Interior National Business Center (DoI/NBC) contract number D11PC20154.
