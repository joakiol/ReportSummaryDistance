We first describe ourprevious work on computing semantic re-latedness from Wikipedia, and its applica-tion to a machine learning based corefer-ence resolution system.
Our results sug-gest that Wikipedia represents a semanticresource to be treasured for NLP applica-tions, and accordingly present the work di-rections to be explored in the future.1 IntroductionThe last decade has seen statistical techniques forNatural Language Processing (NLP) gaining thestatus of standard approaches to most NLP tasks.While advances towards robust statistical inferencemethods (cf.
e.g.
Domingos et al (2006) and Pun-yakanok et al (2006)) will certainly improve thecomputational modelling of natural language, webelieve that crucial advances will also come from re-discovering the use of symbolic knowledge, i.e.
thedeployment of large scale knowledge bases.Arguments for the necessity of symbolically en-coded knowledge for AI and NLP date back at leastto McCarthy (1959).
Symbolic approaches usingknowledge bases, however, are expensive and time-consuming to maintain.
They also have a limitedand arbitrary coverage.
In our work we try to over-come such problems by relying on a wide coverageon-line encyclopedia developed by a large amount ofusers, namely Wikipedia.
That is, we are interestedin whether and how Wikipedia can be integrated intoNLP applications as a knowledge base.
The motiva-tion comes from the necessity to overcome the brit-tleness and knowledge acquisition bottlenecks thatNLP applications suffer.2 Previous Work: WikiRelate!
andSemantic Knowledge Sources forCoreference ResolutionPonzetto & Strube (2006) and Strube & Ponzetto(2006) aimed at showing that ?the encyclopedia thatanyone can edit?
can be indeed used as a semanticresource for research in NLP.
In particular, we as-sumed its category tree to represent a semantic net-work modelling relations between concepts, and wecomputed measures of semantic relatedness from it.We did not show only that Wikipedia-based mea-sures of semantic relatedness are competitive withthe ones computed from a widely used standardresource such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), butalso that including semantic knowledge mined fromWikipedia into an NLP system dealing with corefer-ence resolution is in fact beneficial.2.1 WikiRelate!
Computing SemanticRelatedness Using WikipediaSemantic relatedness measures have been proven tobe useful in many NLP applications such as wordsense disambiguation (Kohomban & Lee, 2005; Pat-wardhan et al, 2005), information retrieval (Finkel-stein et al, 2002), information extraction patterninduction (Stevenson & Greenwood, 2005), inter-pretation of noun compounds (Kim & Baldwin,2005), paraphrase detection (Mihalcea et al, 2006)and spelling correction (Budanitsky & Hirst, 2006).Approaches to measuring semantic relatedness that9relatednessmeasure(s)computationsearch for a connecting path along the category networkpage query and retrieval, category extraction"JohnZorn"query"FelaKuti"queryMusiciansComposersJazz composersMusical activistspage : John Zornpage : Fela KutiFigure 1: Wikipedia-based semantic relatedness computation.
First, target pages for the given queries are re-trieved, possibly via disambiguation.
Next, categories are extracted to provide an entry point to the categorynetwork.
Connecting paths are then searched along the category network using a depth-limited search.
Thepaths found are scored and the ones satisfying the measure definitions (i.e.
the shortest one for path-lengthmeasures, and the most informative one for information-content measures) are returned.use lexical resources transform that resource intoa network or graph and compute relatedness us-ing paths in it1.
For instance, Rada et al (1989)traverse MeSH, a term hierarchy for indexing arti-cles in Medline, and compute semantic relatednessas the edge distance between terms in the hierar-chy.
Jarmasz & Szpakowicz (2003) use the sameapproach with Roget?s Thesaurus while Hirst & St-Onge (1998) apply a similar strategy to WordNet.The novel idea presented in Strube & Ponzetto(2006) was to induce a semantic network from theWikipedia categorization graph to compute mea-sures of semantic relatedness.
Wikipedia, a multi-lingual Web-based free-content encyclopedia, al-lows for structured access by means of categories:the encyclopedia articles can be assigned one ormore categories, which are further categorized toprovide a so-called ?category tree?.
Though not de-1An overview of lexical resource-based approaches to mea-suring semantic relatedness is presented in Budanitsky & Hirst(2006).
Note that here we do not distinguish between seman-tic similarity (computed using hyponymy/hyperonymy, i.e.
is-a, relations only) and semantic relatedness (using all relationsin the taxonomy, including antonymic, meronymic, functionalrelations such as is-made-of, etc.
), since the relations betweencategories in Wikipedia are neither semantically typed nor showa uniform semantics (see Section 3).signed as a strict hierarchy or tree, the categoriesform a graph which can be used as a taxonomy tocompute semantic relatedness.
We showed (1) howto retrieve Wikipedia articles from textual queriesand resolve ambiguous queries based on the arti-cles?
link structure; (2) compute semantic related-ness as a function of the articles found and the pathsbetween them along the categorization graph (Fig-ure 1).
We evaluated the Wikipedia-based measuresagainst the ones computed from WordNet on bench-marking datasets from the literature (e.g.
Miller andCharles?
(1991) list of 30 noun pairs) and foundWikipedia to be competitive with WordNet.2.2 Semantic Knowledge Sources forCoreference ResolutionEvaluating measures of semantic relatedness onword pair datasets poses non-trivial problems, i.e.all available datasets are small in size, and it is notalways clear which linguistic notion (i.e.
similar-ity vs. relatedness) underlies them.
Accordingly, inPonzetto & Strube (2006) we used a machine learn-ing based coreference resolution system to providean extrinsic evaluation of the utility of WordNet andWikipedia relatedness measures for NLP applica-tions.
We started with the machine learning based10WordNetWikipediaPrinceFela KutiThe Minneapolis Geniusthe pioneer of Afrobeat musicThe artist formerly known as PrinceTAFKAPThe ArtistRaw texthePrinceFela Kutithe pioneer of Afrobeat musicThe Minneapolis GeniusheTAFKAPThe ArtistThe artist formerly known as Princewith coreference chainsText annotatedPreprocessingpipelinePoS taggerChunkerNERBaseline Feature ExtractorMaxEntclassifierSemantic FeatureextractorSEMANTICS(Soon et al, 2001)Figure 2: Overview of the coreference system for extrinsic evaluation of WordNet and Wikipedia relatednessmeasures.
We start with a baseline system from Soon et al (2001).
We then include at different timesfeatures from WordNet and Wikipedia and register performance variations.baseline system from Soon et al (2001), and an-alyzed the performance variations given by includ-ing the relatedness measures in the feature set (Fig-ure 2).
The results showed that coreference resolu-tion benefits from information mined from seman-tic knowledge sources and also, that using featuresinduced from Wikipedia gives a performance onlyslightly worse than when using WordNet.3 Future Work: Inducing an Ontologyfrom a Collaboratively GeneratedEncyclopediaOur results so far suggest that Wikipedia can be con-sidered a semantic resource in its own right.
Un-fortunately, the Wikipedia categorization still suf-fers from some limitations: it cannot be consideredan ontology, as the relations between categories arenot semantically-typed, i.e.
the links between cate-gories do not have an explicit semantics such as is-a,part-of, etc.
Work in the near future will accordinglyconcentrate on automatically inducing the semanticsof the relations between Wikipedia categories.
Thisaims at transforming the unlabeled graph in Figure3(a) into the semantic network in Figure 3(b), wherethe links between categories are augmented with aclearly defined semantics.The availability of explicit semantic relationswould allow to compute semantic similarity ratherthan semantic relatedness (Budanitsky & Hirst,2006), which is more suitable for coreference res-olution.
That is, we assume that the availabilityof hyponymic/hyperonymic relations will allow usto compute lexical semantic measures which willfurther increase the performance of our coreferenceresolution system, as well as further bringing for-ward Wikipedia as a direct competitor of manually-designed resources such as WordNet.In order to make the task feasible, we are currentlyconcentrating on inducing is-a vs. not-is-a semanticrelations.
This simplifies the task, but still allowsus to compute measures of semantic similarity.
Aswe made limited use of the large amount of text inWikipedia, we are now trying to integrate text andcategorization.
This includes extracting semantic re-lations expressed in the encyclopedic definitions bymeans of Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992), detectionof semantic variations (Morin & Jacquemin, 1999)between category labels, as well as using the cat-egorized pages as bag-of-words to compute scoresof idf-based semantic overlap (Monz & de Rijke,2001) between categories.
Further work will thenconcentrate on making this information available toour coreference resolution system, e.g.
via semanticsimilarity computation.Finally, since Wikipedia is available in many lan-guages, we believe it is worth performing experi-ments in a multilingual setting.
Accordingly, we arecurrently testing a website2 that will allow us to col-lect word relatedness judgements from native speak-2Available at http://www.eml-research.de/nlp/353-TC.11CyberneticsArtificial IntelligenceNatural Language ProcessingArtificial Intelligence applications Cognitive architectureComputer ScienceComputational LinguisticsSpeech recognitionCognitionCognitive ScienceLinguisticsPhilosophyBranches of philosophyOntologyMetaphysicsLogicPataphysicsMathematical logicMathematicsThoughtAbstractionBelief(a) current category graphCyberneticsArtificial IntelligenceNatural Language ProcessingPART-OFArtificial Intelligence applications Cognitive architectureComputer ScienceComputational LinguisticsPART-OFSpeech recognitionPART-OF IS-ACognitionCognitive ScienceLinguisticsIS-APhilosophyBranches of philosophyIS-AOntologyPART-OFMetaphysicsLogicIS-APataphysicsIS-NOTMathematical logicIS-AMathematicsPART-OFThoughtAbstractionBelief(b) category graph augmented with semantic relationsFigure 3: Inducing explicit semantic relations between categories in Wikipediaers of German, French and Italian, in order to trans-late the semantic relatedness dataset from Finkel-stein et al (2002) and test our methodology withlanguages other than English.4 ConclusionsIn this paper we presented our previous efforts on us-ing Wikipedia as a semantic knowledge source.

We be-lieve that our work opens up exciting new challengesfor the AI and NLP research community, e.g.
how tohandle the noise included in such knowledge basesand how to fully structure the information given inthe form of only partially structured text and rela-tions between knowledge base entries.Acknowledgements: This work has been fundedby the Klaus Tschira Foundation, Heidelberg, Ger-many.
