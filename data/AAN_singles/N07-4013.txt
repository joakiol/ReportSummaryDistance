In contrast, the TextRunnersystem demonstrates a new kind of informa-tion extraction, called Open Information Ex-traction (OIE), in which the system makes asingle, data-driven pass over the entire cor-pus and extracts a large set of relationaltuples, without requiring any human input.
(Banko et al, 2007) TextRunner is a fully-implemented, highly scalable example of OIE.TextRunner?s extractions are indexed, al-lowing a fast query mechanism.Our first public demonstration of the Text-Runner system shows the results of perform-ing OIE on a set of 117 million web pages.
Itdemonstrates the power of TextRunner interms of the raw number of facts it has ex-tracted, as well as its precision using our novelassessment mechanism.
And it shows the abil-ity to automatically determine synonymous re-lations and objects using large sets of extrac-tions.
We have built a fast user interface forquerying the results.2 Previous WorkThe bulk of previous information extractionwork uses hand-labeled data or hand-craftedpatterns to enable relation-specific extraction(e.g., (Culotta et al, 2006)).
OIE seeks toavoid these requirements for human input.Shinyama and Sekine (Shinyama andSekine, 2006) describe an approach to ?un-restricted relation discovery?
that does awaywith many of the requirements for human in-put.
However, it requires clustering of the doc-uments used for extraction, and thus scales inquadratic time in the number of documents.It does not scale to the size of the Web.For a full discussion of previous work, pleasesee (Banko et al, 2007), or see (Yates and Et-zioni, 2007) for work relating to synonym res-olution.3 Open IE in TextRunnerOIE presents significant new challenges for in-formation extraction systems, includingAutomation of relation extraction, which intraditional information extraction uses hand-labeled inputs.Corpus Heterogeneity on the Web, whichmakes tools like parsers and named-entity tag-gers less accurate because the corpus is differ-ent from the data used to train the tools.Scalability and efficiency of the system.Open IE systems are effectively restricted toa single, fast pass over the data so that theycan scale to huge document collections.In response to these challenges, Text-Runner includes several novel components,which we now summarize (see (Banko et al,2007) for details).1.
Single Pass ExtractorThe TextRunner extractor makes a sin-gle pass over all documents, tagging sen-tences with part-of-speech tags and noun-phrase chunks as it goes.
For each pair of nounphrases that are not too far apart, and subjectto several other constraints, it applies a clas-sifier described below to determine whether ornot to extract a relationship.
If the classifier25deems the relationship trustworthy, a tuple ofthe form t = (ei, rj , ek) is extracted, whereei, ek are entities and rj is the relation betweenthem.
For example, TextRunner might ex-tract the tuple (Edison, invented, light bulbs).On our test corpus (a 9 million document sub-set of our full corpus), it took less than 68CPU hours to process the 133 million sen-tences.
The process is easily parallelized, andtook only 4 hours to run on our cluster.2.
Self-Supervised ClassifierWhile full parsing is too expensive to apply tothe Web, we use a parser to generate trainingexamples for extraction.
Using several heuris-tic constraints, we automatically label a setof parsed sentences as trustworthy or untrust-worthy extractions (positive and negative ex-amples, respectively).
The classifier is trainedon these examples, using features such as thepart of speech tags on the words in the re-lation.
The classifier is then able to decidewhether a sequence of POS-tagged words is acorrect extraction with high accuracy.3.
Synonym ResolutionBecause TextRunner has no pre-defined re-lations, it may extract many different stringsrepresenting the same relation.
Also, as withall information extraction systems, it can ex-tract multiple names for the same object.
TheResolver system performs an unsupervisedclustering of TextRunner?s extractions tocreate sets of synonymous entities and rela-tions.
Resolver uses a novel, unsupervisedprobabilistic model to determine the probabil-ity that any pair of strings is co-referential,given the tuples that each string was extractedwith.
(Yates and Etzioni, 2007)4.
Query InterfaceTextRunner builds an inverted index ofthe extracted tuples, and spreads it across acluster of machines.
This architecture sup-ports fast, interactive, and powerful relationalqueries.
Users may enter words in a relation orentity, and TextRunner quickly returns theentire set of extractions matching the query.For example, a query for ?Newton?
will returntuples like (Newton, invented, calculus).
Usersmay opt to query for all tuples matching syn-onyms of the keyword input, and may also optto merge all tuples returned by a query intosets of tuples that are deemed synonymous.4 Experimental ResultsOn our test corpus of 9 million Web doc-uments, TextRunner extracted 7.8 millionwell-formed tuples.
On a randomly selectedsubset of 400 tuples, 80.4% were deemed cor-rect by human reviewers.We performed a head-to-head compari-son with a state-of-the-art traditional in-formation extraction system, called Know-ItAll.
(Etzioni et al, 2005) On a set of tenhigh-frequency relations, TextRunner foundnearly as many correct extractions as Know-ItAll (11,631 to 11,476), while reducing theerror rate of KnowItAll by 33% (18% to12%).AcknowledgementsThis research was supported in part by NSFgrants IIS-0535284 and IIS-0312988, DARPAcontract NBCHD030010, ONR grant N00014-05-1-0185 as well as gifts from Google, andcarried out at the University of Washington?sTuring Center.ReferencesM.
