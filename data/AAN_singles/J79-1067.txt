~ d v ~ n c r d  P~i~rartbtProjecto Agency.A Modcl of DialogueSUMMARYWithin a view of ianguagc users as problem solvers, speakers arc seen as creatinguttcrsnccs in pursuit of thcir own goals.
Dialogue "works" because this activity tends toscrvc goals of both participants.
,k Hcncc, fo r  the model of dialogue cornprchcnsionprcscnted here, rccognif ion of these goals of the speaker i s  central to the comprehension4 "of d i a l o ~ u c ,Wc have found that dialogues arc conrposud of structured interactions rcpresantedby collections of knowledge which dcscri be the intcrre latcd goals of the part ic ipants.We call thcsc knawlcd~c  structures "Dialogue-games" (DGg).
This paper describes DGsin gcncra l ,  a particular one (the Hclping-DG) in some detail, how OGs are used by ourD i a l o g ~ c - g a m e  Model (DGM), and the benefits of this model.A DG consists of three parts: the Parameters (the two roles fillcd by t hcpart ic ipants, and the topic), the Pnramcter Spccifications (a  set of predicates on thePararndcrs), and the  Components (a sequcncc of goals hgld by the participants i n  thecourse of the dialogue).For cxample, in  the Helping-DG, the Parameters are HELPER, HELPEE ( the rolcs)and TASK (the topic).
The  Spccifications are: 1) The HELPEE wants to pertorm theTASK: 2) thc HELPEE wants t o  bc a6/e to do i t  but 3) the HELPEE i s  not able to.
4) TheILELPER wants to  enable the HELPEE to  do  the TASK and 5) the HELPER i s  ab/e toprovide th is  help.
The Componcntr specify that 1) the  HELPEE wants to  es tab l i sh  acontext by describing a collection of unexceptional events (a parlial performance of theTASK): 2) he also wants to dcscribc some sort  of unresirable surprise: then 3) the.I-IELPER wants to  cxplain the violation of expectation so that the HELPEE can avoid i t  a'ndget on with the  TASK.The DGM makes use of DGs in fiue stages of processing: Nomination, Recognition,Instant iat ion, Conduct and Termination.Thc DGM models each  participant's knowlcd,ge, goal and attention states.
Amcchanisrn adds to  the attention state, cmcepts "suggested" by those already in attention.Whcn a hearer sees himself or his partner as  potentially filling a role in a DG(by fulfillingone o r  more demands of the DG's Specifications) then that DG i s  brought into attention(Nominated),DGs can bc nominated by weak evidence: Recognition i s  the step of verifying thatthese DGs arc plausibly consistent with the currcnt state of the model.
Thosa which arcnot are eliminated f rom attention.A Model of DialogueDGs which survive Lhc Recognition stagp arc Instantiated by asserting (asassumptions) all the Specifications not ye1 rcprcscnicd as holding.
For example, when aperson says "Do you have a match?
", instantiation, by the hcarer (of the-~c t ion-sck  DG)dcrivcs asscrtionr; that thc speaker does not have a match and wants the hcarer to  givehim one,The Conduct of ihc DG i s  rnodclcd by tracking the pursuit and fulfillment of theparticipants' goals as rcprescntcd in the Components.Whcn tho DGM dctcpls that onc parlicipant no longer regards a Specification asholding, this crcatcs an cxpcctation of the Termination of this phase of thedialogue--there i s  no longer a possibility that it will serve both participants' goals,Thc appendix contains a detailed hand-simulation of the DGM assimilating ascgrncnt of a dialogue.A Modcl of DialogueCONTENTS2.

Deficiencies in Current  Man-machine CommunicationAppendix -- Sirnulslion of the Uiaip~;ue-l;nmu ModelA Modcl of DialogueSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMThc broadest goal of our research has been to improve the sorry state of interactiveman-machine communication, including its appearance of complexity, rigidity, lack ofcontinuity and the  difficulty i t  poses for many people to acquire useful levels ofcornpctcnce.
I n  our pursuit of this goal, w e  have adopted-the following two assumptions:Assumption L: When pcople communicate w i th  machines, they do so b yusing their already well-dcvelopcd ability to communicate w i th  other people.Assumption 2: The effectiveness of this communication i s  diminished b y  anyadaptation required of the human.A scientific understanding of how people cvmmunicate i s  thus relevant to the designof man-machine communication schemes, but suchknowledge i s  seldom used in  the designprocess.
Since human communication skills have not been characterized at a level ofclctsil appropriate for guiding design, interface designers have not been able to take intoaccount some major determinants of their succcss.The opcrativc goal of our research was therefore to creatd a mode/ of humancommunicafion at an appropriate level of detail to benefit man-machine communicationdesign.
Any form of communication must be based on ,knowledge shared b y  theindividuals engazed in  that communication.
However, the nature of this sharedknowladgs and how i s  i t  uscd in the communicative process have not been we l lundcrstood.
We have developed a working hypothesis which has deeply affected ther-csearch:Hypothesis: People know that certain kinds of goals may be pursued bycommunication, and they know which kinds of communication acts correspondto which goals.
Tho use of this knowledge is essential to comprehendingdialogue.I n  particular, a pcrson generates an utterance to advance one or more of his own goals.Thus, to assimilate a particular utterance, i t  i s  necessary to identify why  the person saidi't.Working w i t h  this hypothesis, we have conducted three related investigations:A Model of Dialogue.1.
A study of naturally occurring language to discover regularities of usageand to  determine what these regularities mean l o  the users of the language.2.
The representation of there regularities as knowledge structures andprocesses in  a dialogue model.3.
T h e  establishment of standards by which the model's performance canbe compared with that of humans on closely related tasks.We have adopted two additional, tactical constraints on the  task:1.
We have modeled only the receptive aspects of communication.2.
Wc-have examined only dialquc communication, interaction i n  real-time,by exactly two people.
These dialogues were conducted over a rcs t t ic tcdmedium so i h a t  there was no visual or intonational communication not capturedin thc  t r ~ n s c r i p t .A ~ o d c l  of DialoguePAST RESEARCH ON LANGUAGE COMPREHENSIONMost of the research jnto language comprehension has focused on thecomprchcnsion of single sentences or fragments of sentences.
However some researchhas indicated the importance of the context created by surrounding sentences on thecomprchcnsion of an individual sentence.
One specific model for the form of th i smulti-scntcntial knowledge i s  the "story schema", organized within a story grammar(Rurnclhart, 1975).
This model has been supportbd' by the results 6f story recalls(Rumcl hart, 1975: Thorndyke, 1977).
Other similar kinds of theoretical constructs fororganizing multiple srntcnces of stories have been proposed called: "frames" (Minsky,1975: Charniak, 1975), "scripts" (Schank Q Abelson, 1975), and "commonsensealgorithms" (Ricgcr, 1975).To account for the conduct and comprchcnsion of dialogues, mu1 ti-scntcntialknowlcdgc units have also bccn proposed by linguists and sociolinguists to explaincertain kinds of rcgul ari tics observed in naturally occurring dialogues.
Thesercgularitics have bccn called "rules" by Labov & Fanshel (19.74) and "sequences" bySacks, Schagloff, & Jefferson (1974).Once these multi-scntential knowledge units a re  evoked, they serve as a basis forcomprehending the~successive inputs.
This is achieved by generating expectations andby providing a framework for integrating the comprehcnsion of an utterance w i t h  that ofi t s  prcdcccssors.
Recently, we have propased (Leuin & Moore, 1976: 1977, Mann,Moorc  Rr Lcvin, 1977) multi-scntential knowledge units that are specified primari ly bythe speaker's and hcarcr's goals.
Thcsc goal-oriented units, which w e  callDialogue-gsmcs[l], specify the kinds of language interactions in wh ich people engage,ra thcr  than the spccific content of thcsc intcractions.

For example, thoy aro not nacoroarify cornpctitivc,consciouily pursued, or zcro-sum.A Model of DialogueAn important problem for rcscarchcrs of language comprehension i s  posed byscntences w i t h  wh ich  tho speaker performs what philosophers of language have ca l led"indirect spccch acts" (Searle, 1969).
The direct comprehension of these sentencesfai ls to der ive  the main communicative~effcct.
For example, declarative scntenccs can beused to seek information ("1 nced to know your Social Security number.
"): questions can beu-scd to convey information ("Did you know that John and Harriet got married?")
or t orequest an action ("Could you pass the salt?'').
These kinds of utterances, w h i c h  haveb c c n  extensively analyzed b y  philosophers of language (Austin, 1962: Searle, 196 9,1975: Grice, 1975), are not handled satisfactorily by  any of the current theories of t h ed i r cc t  comprchcnsion of language.
However, these indirect language usages arawidespread in  naturally occurring language--even two-year-old ch i ldren cancomprehend indirect requests for action almost as well as dircct requests (Shatz, 1975).O n e  theory proposcd to account for these indirect uses of language i s  based on theconcept of "convcrsotional postulates" (Grice, 1975: Gordon Q Lakoff, 197 1).
I f  thed i rcc t  comprchcnsion of an utterance is  implausible, then the indirect meaning i s  de r i vedusing these postulates.
Clark & Lucy (1 975) formalized and tested th is  model, and foundthat people's rasponse times tend to support a three-stage model (deriving the l i te ra lmcaning, check i ts  plausibil i ty and, i f  implausible, dcriving the "intended" meaning" fromconvcrsational rules).I n  general, this approach to i n d i r e d  speech acts i s  infc~ence-bascd, depending onthe  application of conversational rules to infer the indirect meaning from the  d i rcc tmcaning and the context.
A different approach has been proposcd b y  L s b o v ~ f i F a n s ~ c l(1 974) and by Levin & Moore (1976: 1977).
Multi-sentential knowledge, organizing ascgmcnt of language interaction, can form the basis for deriving the indikect effect ofu t t c r~ncc  wi th in  the segment.
For example, a multi-sentential structure for  aninformation-seeking interaction can sypply the appropriate context for interpreting thesubscqucnt utterances to s ~ c k  and t-hen supply information.
The infcrcncc-bascdapproach rcqui rcs one set of convcrs~t ional  rulc-, for information requests, a dif fcrcnt  9ctof ru lcs  for  answers to these rcquc:ts, and a way t o  tic thcnc two  rulc sets together.
TheDialogue-game model postulates a single k n o w l c d ~ e  struclurc for this kind of interaction,w i t h  coopcrating proccssc; for: (1) rccognizinp; when this kind of interaction i s  proposcd,(2) using this knowlcdgc to comprchcnd uttcranccn within i ts scope, and (3) ident i fy ingwhen  the interaction i s  to be terminated,A Modc l  of DialogueTHE SHAPE OF THE THEORYOur thcory  of human language use has bccn strongly influenced by w o r k  in humanprob lem solving (Ncwcll XI Simon, 1972) in which the bchavior of a human i s  modeled asan information.

Wc view humans as engaging in linguistic bchavior in orderto  advance the state of certain of thcir eoals.
Thcy dccide to use language, they sclcct(o r  accept) thc  other participant for a dialogue, they choose the details of l inguisticcxp rcss ion  -- all with the expectation that some of their desired state specifications canthcrcby be rcalizcd,In this thcory of lancuagc, a participant in  a linguistic exchange views the other asan indcpcndcnt information-processing system, w i th  separate knowledge, goals, abi l i t iesand acccss l o  the world.
A spcsker h a s  a range of potcntial changes he can cf fcct  i n  h i sl i ~ t c n c r ,  a corresponding collection of linguistic actions which may result in each suchchance, and some notion of the conscqucnccs of performing each of these.
The  spcokcrmay view the hcarcr  as a resource for information, a potential actor, or as an object  to bcmoldcd into sorrrc dcsircd state.A dialogue involves two  speakers, who altcrnatc as hearers.

Thus a dialoguo continues because thepart icipants continue to scc i t  as furthering thcir  own goals.

The two  participants interact smoothly because the conventions ofcommunication coordinate their  goals and give them continuihg reasons t o  speak andlisten.
These goals have a number of attributes which are not necessarily consequencesof c i t hc r  human activity in general, or communication in particula'r; but which arenonetheless characteristic of human communication in  the form of dialogue:1.
Goals are cooperatively esta5lished.

Furthermore, the hearer recognizesand uses thcsc goals as part of h is  understanding of the utterance.An ~ninlerrupted ialogue goes through three phases:establishing goals,pcir sui ng eobl s,dccommitting from goals.A Modcl of DialogueTypically this sequcncc i s  repeated several times over the coursc of a few rninutcs.We havc crcotcd knowlcdse structurcs to rcprescnt these convcntions,, andproccsscs to apply the conventions to actual dialo~ucs to comprehend them; Since theknowledsc structures dominatc al l  of the activity, they are described f irst.
Theassimilation of an uttcranco in the dialogue i s  rcprcscntcd in this model by a sequence ofmodifica\ions of a "Work~pacc"[2] which rcprcscnfs the attention or awareness af thelistening party.

For  the bslancc of this section, we will elaborate on these three par ts  andcxcmp l i f y  these with an cxalliple of the Helping-game.D ia lo~ue-games capture a certain collection of inforhation, common across manydialv~ucs.
However, the individual participants involved and the content subject  df t hedialoguc may yary  freely over dialogues described b y  the same Dialogue-game.
Torepresent  this, each Dialogue-game has a set of Parameters wh ich  assume specif ic valuesf o r  each part icular  dialogue.Thc dialogue types w c  have represented so far as Dialogue-games have eachrequ i red  only thrcc Parameters: the two participants involved (called "Roles"), and thesubjcct  of the dialogue (called "Topic").Pa ra rndc r  SpccificationsOnc of the  major aspects distinguishing various types of d'ialogucs i s  the set of goalshcld by the  participants.
Another such aspect i s  the set of kno'wledgc states of theparticipants.
We have found that each type of dialogue has a char$cteristic set of eaaland knowledge states of the participants, vis-a-vis each other and the subject.
W i t h i nthe formalism of the Dialogue-game, these are called the Parameter Spccifications, anda re  rcprpscnted b y  a collection of predicates on the Parameters.These Spccifications are known to the participants of the  dialogue, and therequirement that they be satisfied during the conduct of a game i s  used by thp part ic ipantst o  signal what Dialogue-games they wish to conduct, to  recognize what game i s  be ing  bid,t o  dccide how t o  respond to a bid, to conduct the game once the  bid i s  accepted, and t oterminate the  garno when appropriate.
These Spccifications also provide the means withw h i c h  t o  expla in  the implicit, but clearly succcssful, communication which accompanicsany natural d i a l o g ~ c .
Examples and discussions of these Specifications will accompanythe fo l low ing  descr ipt ion of !he Helping-game.ComponcntsW h i l e  the Paramctsr Spccificstions represent those aspects of a dialogue t y p e  thatr cma in  constant throughout the course of a dialogue of that type, we have also found tha tcertain aspects change i n  systematic ways.

Thcse subgoals aremutual ly  complcn~cntary, each set facilitating the other.
Furthermore, by the time thetcrrninati on stage has been rcachcd, pursuit of t he  Component-specified subgoals willhave assurcd satisfaction of the higher, initial goals of the participants, for which theCame was initiated in thc first place.I n  this scction, wc c.xhibit a specific Diolocuc-game: the Helping - gn/ne.
Thisgame i s  prcscntcd in an informal rcprcsentation, in  order to  emphasize the informationalcontent, rather than the representational power of our formalism.
Later in  this report wewill prcscnt thc formal analocue of this same game.
I n  what follows, the bo ld  faceindicates the  information contained in tho representation of this particular Dialogue-game:the tcxt in regular type i s  explanatory commentary.The (annotated) Helping-game.- - - - - - - - 1 - - - 1 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Pnmn~clcrs:  HELPEE, HELPER, and TASK.The HELPEE wants help from the HELPEE.
The TASK issome sort of a problem, otherwise unspecified.Paran~eler Specificat ions:HELPEE: wants to perform TASK.HELPFE: wants lo be able lo perform TASK.HELPEE: not ab/e lo perform TASK.HELPEE: permit ted t i i  per f i rm  TASK.MELPFF: a person.A Modcl of DialogueThcse Spccifications not only constrain who would qualifyas fi l l ing the rolc of HELPEE, but also provide reliable informationabout t he  HELPEE, given that this individual i s  believed to beengaged i n  the Helping-game.
This prohibits someone fromasking for help on a problem he did not want solved.
Similarly, i fone r c c ~ i v c s  what he judges to  be a sincere request for help to dosome task, the helper normally as:umes that the requester has thenecessary authority to do the task, i f  only he knew how.HELPER: wants t o  help HELPEE perform TASK.HELPER: able to provide help.HELPER: a person.So, in ordcr to be a HELPER, an individual must be wil l ing andable to  provide the needed assistance.
Since th is Dialogue-gamercprcscnts shared knowledge, the HELPER knows t h e s eSpccifications, and therefore will not b id the Helping-game tosomeone who i s  not likely to meet them.
And similarly, no onewho fails to meet these Specifications (and knows he fails) w i l laccept a bid for the Helping-game with himself as HELPER.Components of the Helping - game:Thcre are three components: the first two constitute the"Diagnosis" phase to communicate what the problem is.. HELPEE wants HEfPFR to know about a sef of unexcepfiona/, acfuuii/events.
'The HELPEE sets up a context by describing a situationwhere everything, so far, i s  going well.
Since the HELPEEassumes that the TASK i s  understood by the HELPER, he alsoassumes that the HELPER shares his expectations for r~bsequentactivity.A Modcl of Dialogue2.
HELPEEwc.mts HELPERfoknowabouf:// a set of exceptional events whkh occurredor2) a set of expected, unexcepflbnal events which did not occur.This pattern of a Helping-game i s  sufficiently well known tothe participants, that the HELPEE almost never needs to  actuallyask a question at this point.
By simply exhibiting a failure ofexpectation, the HELPEE has communicated that this acts as ablock to  his successfully pursuing the TASK.
The HELPER i sexpected to explain why  the failure occurred and how HELPEE can-avoid it or otherwise continue in the TASK.The third componcnt specifies the 'Treatment" phase wherethe HELPER communicates an explanation for the perceivedfailure.3 HELPER wants HELPEE fo know about an action which w i l l  avoid theundesired event or cause the desired one.The context description enables the HELPEE to identify acollection of activities which he understands, and in which theHELPEE i s  attempting to participate.
Theviolation-of-expectation description points out just where theHELPEE's image of the activities differs from the correct image.
I ti s  from this area of difference that the HELPER selects an actionfor the HELPEE.A Model of Dialogue#ia/o,mue - games i n  the Con?pre/rension of DialogueI n  this section we describe the five stages of dialogue assimilation and detail theinvolvement of Dialogue-games wi th ~ a c h  stage:1) nomination,2) recognition,3) instantiation,4) conduct,5) termination.Proccssi ng EnvironmentOur description of the model should be viewed as representing the changingcoy,nitive state of one of the participants, throunhout the course of the dialogue.
That is,two models are involved, one for each participant.
Since the same processingoccurs for both, we wi l l  describe only one.T h c  Dialogue-Game Modcl consists of a Long-Term Memory (LTM), a Workspacc(WS), and a set of proccsscs that modify the contents of WS, contingent upon the contentsof LTM and  WS.
LTM conbins a rcprescntation of the knowledge that the partigulardi ologuc participant bl ines to the dialogue b c f o ~ e  i t  starts.
This includcs knowlcdgcabout the  world, relevant objects, processes, concepts, the cognitive statc of h i s  partnerin dialogue, rules of inference and evidence, as well as linguistic knowlcdp;e (words andthc i r  semantic rcprcscntation, case frames for verbs and predicates and the multi-turnlanguage s'trbctures, the  Dialogue-games).WS i s  the volatile short-term rncmory of thc modcl, containing all the partial andtemporary rcsults of processing.
The contcnte of WS at any momcnt rcprc.
;cnt thcmadel's state of comprchcnsion and focus at that point.
Tho processes arc autonomousspecialists, opcrl~tiny: indcpcndcntly and in parallel, to modify thqentitics in WS (callcd"activations").
Thcsc proccsscs a rc  also influcnccd by the contents of WS, as wel l  a.; b ythc  knowlcdgc in LTM.
Thus, WS i s  the place in which thcso concurrcnt~ly operatingproccsscs interact with each othcr.
This anarchistic control structure rcscrnblcs thatthe HEARSAY system (Erman, Fennel, Lesser & Rcddy, 1973)A Modcl of DialogueNominationWhen d ia lo~uc participants propose a new type of interaction, they do notconsistently use any single word or  phrase to introducc the interaction.
Thus we cannotdcterminc which Dialogue-games represent the dialoguc type through a simpleinvocation by namc or any othcr pre-known collection of words or phrases.
Instcad thed i o l o ~ u c  type i s  cornmunicatcd by attempts to establish various entities as the  values ofthe Psi actcrs of ihe dcsircd Dialogue-game.
Thus, an utterance w h i c h  i scornprchcndcd as associating an entity (a-person or a concept) with a Parameter of aDi aloguc-game suggests that Dialogue-game as a possi bilily for initiation.The Dialogue-Game Modcl has two ways in which these nominations of n c wDialo~uc-games occur.
One of the processes of the modcl i s  a "spreading activation"proccss  call& Protcus (Lcvin, 1976).
Protcus gcncratcs new activations i n  WS on thcbasic of cclations in LTM, from concepts (nodes i n  the semantic network) that are alreadyi n  WS.
Protcus brings into focus concepts somehow related to  those already thcrc.
Acollection of concepts in WS leads to focusing on some aspect of a part icularDialocuc-game, in this sense "nominating" i t  as a possible new Dialoeue-game.MATCH and DEDUCE are two of thc modcl s processes which operatc in  .conjunctionto ccncratc ncw activations from existing ones, means of finding and ap,prp@rulc-liketransformations, Thcy operate through partial match and plausible i nfcrencetcchniques,and i f  thcy activate Pardrnetcrs, thcn the Dialogue-gsrnc that contains those ~ a r a r n d t c r sbccomcs nomina,tcd as .a  candidate Dialogue-game.
Match and Deduce operate to,getheras a kind of production system (Newell, 1973).For  cx;lmplc, from the input utterance:"I tr ied to send a message to <person> at <computer-site3 and it~didn't go.
"the following t w o  scqucnccs of associations and inferences result:( l a )  I tr jcd toX.
(25) 1 wpntcd to X.
(3a) 1'want to X.
(4a) HELPEE wants to do TASK.
( I b) It didn't go.
(2b) What I tr ied to do didn't work.
(3b) X didn't work.
(4b) I can't X.
(58) 1 don't know ha to X.
(6b) HEL.PEE\doc$n7t know how to do TASK.A Model of Dialogue(Where: I = HELPEE and X = do TASK = send a message to <person> at <computer-site>.
)A t  th i s  point, (45) and (6b), since they are both Parameter Specifications for theHelping-game, cause the model to focus on this Dialogue-game, in effect nominating i t  asan organizing structure for the dialogue being initiated.Thc proccsscs described so far are reasonably unselective and may activate anumber of possible Dialogue-eamcs, some of which may be mutually incompatible orothcrwisc inappropriate.
The Dialogue-garnc Manager investigates each of thenomi natcd Dial.oguc-games, verifying infcrcnccs based on the Parameter Specifications,and eliminating< those Dialogue-gamcs for which one or more Specifications arecontraclictcd.A second rncchanism (part of Protcus) identifies those activations which areincornpati blc and scts about accumulating evidence in support of a decision to accept oneand dclctc the rest from the WS.Fdr cxarnplc, suppose the question"How do I get RUNOFF to work?
"lcads to the nomination of two games:Info-scck-game (pcrson asking question wants to know answer)andInfo-probe-game (pcrson asking q u c d i ~ n  wants to k n ~ w  if other knows answcr)Thcso Iwo Dialocuc-~nrncs have a l o t  in common hut differ in  ono crucial aspect,: I n  theInfo-scck-gamc, t hc  qucctioncr docs not know the answcr to thc question, whilc in  thcInfo-probc-game hc doc:.

Prolcus rcprcsent: this d i~covery  wi th a structure which ha5 thec f f cc t  of climinatinp, thc conflicting Dialogue-came with the least supporting evidence.Such support might be, for cxamplc, cither the knowledge that the speaker i s  t h ~  hearcr'stcachcr or that hc i s  a novice prograrnrncr (which would icnd support f6r tho choicc of theInfo-prabc-errme or Info-seek-garnc, respectively).A Model of, Dialogue 21Through these proccsscs, the number of candidate Dialogue-games i s  reduced untilthose remaining are rompatible w i t h  each other and with the knowledge current ly in WSand in LTM.Instant iat ionOncc a proposed Dialogue-game has successfully survived the  f i l ter ing proce.Bsesdescribe-d above, i t  i s  thcn instantiated by the Dialogue-game Manager.
ThoseParameter Specifications not prcviou:ly known (represented in the WS) are estab l ishedas new ly  in fc r red  knowledge about the Parameters.
A large par t  of t he  imp l ic i tcommunication between dialogue participants i s  modeled through instantiation.To i l lustrate this, suppose that the fol lowing come to be represented in  WS (i.e.,known) in the  course of assimilating an utterance:SPEAKER does not know how to do a TASK.S P E A ~ E R  wants to  know how to  do that TASK.SPEAKER wants t-o do the TASK*Thcso a re  adequate to nominate the Helping-game.
I n  the process of instantiating th i sDialogue-game, the fol lowing predicates are added to WS:SPEAKER bel ieves HEARER knows h o w  to do TASK,SPEAKER bel ieves HEARER i s  able to  tel l  him h o w  to d o  TASK.SPEAKER believes HEARER i s  wi l l ing to tell him how to do TASK..SPEAKER wants HEARER to  tell hirn.how t o  do TASK.SPEAKER expects HEARER to  t'cll'him how to do TASK.Thc model predicts that jhcsc predicates w i l l  bo impl ici t ly communicated by anut terance which r;uccecds in instantiating thc Helping-game.
This corresponds to  adialogue in which "&I can't gct this thing to work" i o  taken to  eommuhicate thot ' thc speakerwnnts to "get this thing to work" (even,though, on the surface, i t  i s  only a simpledeclarative of the speaker9$ abi'lity).ConductOncc a Dialogue-game i s  instantiated, tho Dialogue-game Managcr i c  guided by thcCorhponcnts in cornprohcnding tho rect of the dialogue.

For the speaker, thesegoals guide what he i s  next to say: forthc hcarcr, these provide expectations for the functions to be served by the speaker ssubscqucnt utterances.Thcse "tactical" goals are central to our theory of language: an utterance i s  notdccmcd ta be comprehended until some direct consequence of i t  i s  seen as serving a goalimputed to the spcakcr Furtherfiore, although the goals of the ~ o m p o n c n i s  arc activeonly w i t h i n  the conduct ef a particular game, their pursuit leads to the satisfaction of t hegoals described in the Parameter ?pccifications, which were held by the participantsp r i o r  to  the evocation cf ihe Dialogue-game.I n  the case of the Helping-game, t he  goals i n  tho "diagnostic" phase arc that thctIELPEE dcscr ibc a scquoncc of related, uncxceptional cvcnte leading up to a failure of h i scxpectotions.
Thcse goals model the  state cyf th6  HELPER as he assimilates this initialpart of thc  dialogue, both in that he  knows how tho HE~PEE i s  attempting l o  dcscribc h isproblcrn, and also that thc HELPER knows whcn this phase i s  past, and thc time has  come(Ihc "trcatrncnt" phase) for h im to provide the help which has been implici t ly rcquesteel.The processes described above perform thc  identification and pursui t  ofDia lo~ue-games.
How, then, arc DGs terminated?
Thc Parameter Specificationsrcp rescn t  thosc a:pects of dialogues that arc constant over that particular t ype  ofdialogue.
The Oinloguc-Game Modcl pushas this a step further in specifying that theDislo~uc-,game continues only sr long  a r  the Parameter Specifications continuc to  hold.Whcnevcr any predicate i n  the Speci f icel ion ceases to hold, then tho model prcdicls thoi rnpcr~ding tcrrnin;jtion of this Dio1oguc;garnc.For r_.xnrnplct, if the  IIIIPEF' na longer wants to pcrfarm thn TASK (r:~lhrlr bynccornpl id--~ir~f:  i t  or  b y  nb:rndonirl~ that goal) ,  hv 'indicl~trr.i fhia with nn irttcsriinct.

All the major parts and their connectivity are shown in Fieure 1.
Thcse parts( two rncmorics and six Proccsscs) wi l l  each be described separately.
Thc appendixcontains an extensive, detailed trace of the model as i t  analyzes (via hand simulation) anaturally occurring dialogue fragment.
Finally, we wi l l  summarize our experience withthe model to date.Long-term Mcrnory (LTM)The Long-Term Memory i s  the rnodcl's representation of a participant's knowledgeof the external world.
I t  contains the initial knowledge states of the participants: thegrammatical case frames, the semantic structures for  word-senses, tho knowledge of thes~b jcc t ,mat te r  of the dia lopu~,  the various ways in which dialoeues are structured, ctc.LTMis a semantic network, containing a set of nodes (also called concepts) and therelations that hold between them at the Iowost ievel.
This information i s  stored i n  theform of triples:<node- 1 relation node-2>Wc have this machinery encoded and working--a 611 complement of read and writeprimitives for th is representation.
However, i t  has proven awkward for us to specifyknowlcdge at this level, so we have implemented further machinery (named SIM) totran.olatc n-ary predicates into these triples.
Thuq far a predicate, P, having argumentsA 1, A2, and A3, SIM can be given the input:PI: (Alpha P Beta Gamma)[ m c a ~ i n g  that P1 i s  defined to be an instance of P (the predicate always goes iR s w dposition) w i t h  arguments Alpha for A l ,  Beta for A2 and Gamma-?or A3.1 The result ingt r ip les w e  created:<P1 PRED P><P1 A 1  ALPHA,<Pl A 2  BETA><PI A 3  GAMMA>Let's examine a more concrete example; suppose we want to include in the LTMthat:A Model of DialogueDialoguetextFigure 1.

A l l  incoming sensations (i.e., utterances) appear in the WS,as do all augmentations of the participant's knowledge and goal statc.
Therepresentational format of the WS i s  the same a s  in LTM.
Each node in the WS isa token(copy) of some node in  LTM.
Whenever some process determines that the model'sattention (WS) should include a token of a specific node (C) from LTM, a new node (A) i screated by copying C and this new node i s  added to the WS.

These rcprcscntations are generated from the surface string using astandard ATN Grammar similar to those developed by Woods (19701 and Norman,Rumelhart, fir the LNR Research Group (1975).
We use a case grammar represeniation,w i t h  each utterance spccificd as a main predicate with a set of parameters.
Bccausc th ismodule i s  a conventional parser whose implementation i s  well understood, we hove so far-produced hand parses of the input utterances, following an ATN grammar.ProtcusThis i s  a sprcodine activation mechanism, which modifies thc activation of conccptsspccificd as rclatcd in  LTM whenever a givcn c o n c ~ p t  bccomcs active.
This mcchanismprovides a way to intcgratc top-down and bottom-up processing with in a uniformframework (Lcvin, 1976).
The Dial ogue-Game iilodel uses Protcus to activate aconccpt, given tha a number of closcly relatcd conccpts (Componcnts, fcaturcs,instances, etc.)
arc active.I 9  Protcus opcratcs on all cu r rw t  activations to modify their salience", a numbcrassociated with each activation that generally represents the importance or rclcvancc oft h e  conccpt.
Two kinds of influence relations can exist bctwccn conccpts: cxc i t c  orinhibit.
I f  an excite r e l a t i ~ n  exists, then Protcus increases the salience af theactivation of that concept in  proportion to the saliencc of the influencing conccpt.
Thehigher the salience of an activation, the larger i t s  influence on directly re la ted  conccpts.I f  an inhibit relation i s  spccificd.
then Process decreases the salience of the activationof the neighboring conccpt.MatchTI- is Proccx i  idkntifics conccpts in LTM that  arc congruent to cxistinc activationr.The Diologuc-Game Modcl conthins a numbcr of cquivalencc-like relations, which Mal'chuses to idcntify a conccpt in LTM as rcprcscn t in~  thc same thing as an activation of somo~ccrningly different concept.
Once this equivalent conccpt is found, i t  i s  activated.Dcpcnding on how this conccpt i o  dcfincd in LTM, i t s  activation may havo cffects.

Only i f  al l  ofthcsc subordinate matches succeed i s  the  top-level Match said to  succccd.Clearly, for  structures of significant complexity, Match may eventually call itc,clfrccursivcly, t o  an arbitrory depth.
However, since each subordinate call i s  on a strictlysmaller unit, th is  process must coitvcrge.A Madcl of DialogueOur experience has shown us that this type of mechanism plus a collection ofrewrite rules enable us to eventually map a wide variety of input parsing structirrcs topre-stored, abstract knowledge structures, in a way that a significant aspect o f  thei rintended meaning has been ass imi la ted in the process.DcduccThis opcratcs to carry out a rule when that rule has become active.
Rules are ofthe form (Condition)->(Action), and Dcduce scnscs thc activity of a rule and applies theru le by activating the concept for the action.
Whatcver corresponocnces were evolvedin the coursc.of cccating the activation of the condition ( lef t )  half of i h e  rule are carr iedover into thc activation of the action (right) half.
The combination of Match and Dcducea em.
gives us the capability o f  a production syctThc operation of Dcducc i s  relatively simple.
I t  i s  called oniy when d rule  i s  a c t i v ein the  WS.
Dcducc attempts to match the left half of this rule with some other activationi n  the WS.
(This has ty-pically already been done by match.)
Assuming this i saccomplished, Dcduce creste t  an ac,tivalion of the right half of the rule, substi luting in theactivation f o r  all subparts for which thcke are correspondences with the i c f t  half.Once a Dialogue-game has been activated (by Protcu.,) as possibly thecomrnunrcation f o r m  being bid for a dialogue, the Dialogue-game Manager uses i t  to  guidethc  assimilation of successive utterances of the  dialogue, through four stages:1. establ ish the Parameter values and verify that no Specification i scontradictcd,2.

Whcn the Manager accesseseach  of thc Para~nctcrs, they arc found either to have activations in thc WS or not.
I fthey do, the cgrrespondcnccs bclwccn activation and Psrsmetcr are established in theWS.
This correspond: l o  a::ignint a value to  thc Paramcicr for this particular evocationof thc Dialogue-game.
Any Parameter that has no activation i c  put on a l ist which i sA Model  of Dialogueperiodically chcckcd i n  the hope that later activity by the Manager will lead t o  thecreation of appropriate activations.Fo r  each of the Specifitations, a check i s  made to determine i f  i t  already has anactivat ion in WS.
( In most cases, the activation of some of these Specifications will haveled t o  the activi ty of the Dialogue-game itself.)
The Specifications having activations needno further attention.For all remaining Spcc,ifications, activations are created substituting for t h eParametcrs as determined above.
At this stage, the Dialogue-game Manager cal lsProtcus to determine the stability of thcso new activations.
Any new activation w h i c hcontradicts exist ing activations will have i ts level of activity sharply reduced by Proteus.I f  th is  happens, the Dialogue-game Manager concludes that some of the necessaryprecondit ions for  the game db not hold (are i n  conflict with current understanding) andthat th is  particular game should be abandoned.
Otherwise, the new activaticns stand asnew knowledge, following from the hypothesis that the chosen game i s  appropriate,The Dialogue-game has now been successfully entered: the Manager sets up thet h i r d  phase, creating activations of the Dialogue-game's Components, w i t h  appropr ia tesubstitutions.
(By this time, any unresolved Parameters may well have -activations,permit t ing thei r  resolution.)
This sets up all of the game-specific knowledge and goals f o rboth participants.Finally, the Manager detects that one of the Specifications no longer appears tohold.
This signals the impending termination of the Dialogue-game.
I n  fact, t heutterance whikh contai'ns this information i s  a bid to terminate.
At th is  point, i f  t hepar t ic i  pants7 init ial  goals are satisfied (thus contradicting the Specification which cal ls  f o rt he  prcsence of those goals) the interaction ends "successfully".
Otherwise, t heDialogue-game i s  terminated for some other reason (e.g., one participant's unwil l ingnesso r  inabi l i ty to  continue) and would generally be regarded as a "failure".
Theseconsequences are infcrred by the Manager and added to the WS.
When a Dialogue-gamehas terminated, i t s  salience goes to zero and i t  i s  removed from the WS.Pronoun ProccsscsThe Dialogue-Gamo Model contains a set of Pronoun Processes, including anI-Process, a You-Process, and an It-Process.
Each of those i s  invoked whenever  the /'associated surface word  appears in an input utterance,, and operates to identify somepreexis t ing activationthat can be seen as a view of  the same object.# Model of DialogueEach of these Processes search t h e  curreot context, as represented by the currentsct of act i ra t ions in the WS, using tho katures specified there ro identify a set of possibleco-rcfctcntial expressions.
When there is more than one possibility, the one with ahi ghcr salience i s  sclectcd.A Model of DialogueDEFICIENCIES IN CURRENT MAN-MACHINE COMMUNICATIONWith the understanding we new have of the multi-sentential aspects of humancommunication, i t  i s  easy to  see why man-machine cornrnun'ietion appears so alien, highlyrestrictive, uncomprehending and awkward.
This i s  because major regulation andinterpret4 f ion structures are missing.In  Table 1, we compare human dialogue and typical man-machine com.municationwith respect to some of these features, The table designates a "sender" ancfa "receiver"which should be identified with the person and the computer, respeclively, in theman-machine communication case.ASPECTS OF NATURAL COMMUNICATIONADDRESSED BY DIALOGUE-GAME THEORY *SENDER'S GOALS KNOWN TO RECIPIENTPARTICIPANTS CAN DECLARE THEIR GOALSGOALS PERSIST OVER SEVEFiAL MESSAGESGOALS IDENTIFIED WITH EACH MESSAGECOMMUNICATION PLANS USEDIMPLICIT COMMUNICATION TAKES PLACEHUMAN MAN-DIALOGUE MACHiNEYES NOYES NOYES NOYES NQYES LITTLEYES LITTLETable 1: f i  @omparison of man-rnan and man-machine communlcalionConventional man-machino communication froqucntly givec tho user o sense thatthe  computcr i s  operating "out of contcwt", since he must continually respccify what irrclcvant to the ongoing dtaloguc.

From answers to this, the interfacewould infcr just what the human was expecting as a response.
This would con~titute amajor s lcp  toward the enabling t h o  intcrface to servo the actual (rather than the poorlycxprcsscd) needs of the user.
Finally, such an intorface would require much l c o ~adaptation on thc parf of the user, and so, by our original hypotheois, would significantlyenhance the cffcctivencss of the man-machine partnership.A Model of DialogueThis paper has described a research effort into the modeling of human dialogue.The purpose of this research has been to  uncover and describe i n  process models,reculari t ics that occur in dialogue.
I t  i s  hopcd that the enhqnced understanding of humancommunication which rcsul ts, will facilitate the development of more natural (and thusmore effective) man-machine interfatcs.Thc principal regularity w'e have discovered i s  a collection of knowledge and goalstructures, called Dialoeue-games, which seem to be crucial in understanding thestructure of naturally-occurring dialogues.
According to the theory we have proposed,one or more of these Dialogue-games serve as the major organizing influence on everyhuman didlogue.Each Dialogue-game specifies what knowledge each person must have to ehgage insuch a dialogue, and what goals of the participants might be served by that interchange.A Dialogue-game also spccifies, as a sequence of "tactical" goals, the manner in which thedialogue i s  conducted.The Diatogua-game Model i s  a collection of cooperative processes whichcontinuausly updated a representation of each participant's attention state in aWorkspaco.
The model recognizes when a particular Dialogue-game i s  being bid,accepted, pursued and terminated, and represents these states appropriately in theWorkspace.

We make use of a particular version of the Helping-game and alscexplore another structure, an Execution Scene, which describes the customary eventssurrounding the successful execution of a particular program (Runoff).We start by describing this more detailed version of the Helping-game, introducingnames fo r  the various aspects, to be used later.
Next we show a short, naturallyoccurring dialogue between a computer operator and a user.
'Then we describe theoperation of the Dialoeuc-garnc'Model as i f  assimilates this dialogue, up to the point atwh ich  i t  concludes that thc Helping-game i s  an appropriate structure t h r o u ~ h  which tounderstand the subr;cqucnt utterances.Once this hypothesis for the form of thedialogue has been chosen, we continue thesimulation to examine how Jhc model dccidcs that a particular Execution Scene i sappropriate for assimilating the content of the dialogue.
'Next, we see how this choice ofoccnes cnhances the set of goals imputed to the speaker, thus facil i tating thecornprehcnsion of what he i s  saying.
Finally, we summarize our experience with theDialogue-game Model so far.A Dctai/ed Structure for the help in,^ - gameWhat  fol4ows i s  the substance of the communication structure we have namcd theHclping-game.
In the interests of clarity af presentation, the formal structureo of thedefinition have been expressed in prose.
However, the elements of the fol lowingdescription correspond one-to-one to those in the actual Helping-game used in ?thesimulation.HELPING-GAMEParamctcrs:Thc parameters are two roles (HELPER and HELPEE) and a topic (TASK/HG).A Modcl of DialogueParameter specifications:The HELPER and HELPEE are each a kind of person.H1 = A goal of t he  HELPEE i s  that he  perform TASK/HG.H2 = I t  i s  not true that HELPEE i s  able to  perform th is  TASKIHG.H5 = The HELPEE wants to be ablc to pcrform the TASKIHG.

Each utterance i s  ingested one at a time, by the Parser, and theassimilat ion proceeds until a quiescent state i s  reached (much more detail, below)whereupon the next segment is  parsed and input for processing.The ident i f icat ion of thc  hclping-gamcHow docs thc model know to evoke the Helping-game?
To exhibi t  answers to t h i ~and  subscqucnt questions, we lead tho reader through a simulation of the model as i tp roccsscs  the  beginning of dialogue OC117.
We indulge in fhe samc use of prorie fo rformal ism as aboQe, again w i t h  the same assuranaes of correspondcnccs with tho actualsirnulati on.Thc simulation proceeds in cycles: i n  each cycle, we exhibit the operat ion of asinzlc processor, performing one i terat ion of i t s  function.
We do not address h c r c  theis:uc; of h o w  the model would select w.hich processor to cal l  next.

segment.Cycle 1-1 -- Parse.The parser reads one utterance/segment of input and translates it into the formalismfo r  activations in the workspace.
No claim ' is made that this translation retains all thecontent of the original text, only that i t  is adequately faithful to the level of detail we aresimulating.Results: Case/9 (= (0 perceives that L asks (how do I get Runoff working?)))
is activated.Cycle 1-2 -- I-processorCertain words (e,g.
pronouns, determiners) are taken to be signals that a referencei s  being made t o  conccpts introduced elsewhere.
Sne presence of a concept i n  theworkspoce corresponding to one of these words lcads to the calling of the.process-specialist which attempts to  resolve the implied reference.
Thus, the presenceof "I" i n  the text leads to the calling of the I-process, whose sole function is  to determinet h e  referent of the .
'I" and modify the stored concept to reflect this.
This process judgesthat i f  L i s  asking a question which contains "I" as its subject, then this constitutesadequate evidence to hypothesize that "I" is being used to refer to L.Results: 0 perceives that L asks (how does L get Runoff working?
)Cycle 1-3 -- MatchMatch i s  always on the lookout for pairs of nodes, one in the WS and the other i n  theLTM, such that the activation (node in WS) matches the concept (node i n  LTM).
Th is  i staken to be evidence that the activation is also to be t iken as an activation of the matchedconcept.
I t  should be understood that we areaexamining only some of the succewfulmatches which occurred,Starting in this cycle, we see a pattern which recurs regularly, and which accountsfcr  a significant piece of the action, as the model assimilates the dialogue.
Matchdcterrnincs that a particular activation matches the left half (condition side, i f  part, etc.)
ofa production-like rule srorcd in LTM.
This successful match leads t o  the identification ofthe  corrcspondcnces between the aspects of the activation and those of the left half ofthe rule, ae well as creating an activation of the rule itself.
The activation of a rule leadsto calling the Deduce processor in thenext cycle, which applies the activated rub to  thenode i n  the WS responsible for the rule's activation.
This application of a rule (whichalso results in thc removal of the rule's activation from the WS) creates a new activationstructure in the WS.A Modcl of DialogueIn othcr words, the introduction of a piece of knowledge suggests that a certaintransformation (e.g.,'"Whcncver you know X, you can conclude Y.")

Thistransformation i s  applied to the stimurus knowledge to generste a conclusion: a new pieceof knowledge.In this particular case, the above result structure i s  found to match the left half ofRule0 = I f  Opcrce ives  a proposition,then 0 knows that proposition.w i t h  thc correspondenccsCase/l (= (L asks(How do I get Runoff working?)))

The Dialogue-game Manager(OGM) makes use of a set of correspondences that have already been established by thematches which led to the activations of HI, H2, and H11:A Modol of DialoguePrevious Rosults: L corresponds to  Hclpee0 corresponds to  HelperCase13 (= (Runoff working)) corresponds to the task.Once ar) activation of a eamc has led to the calling of the DGM, the Manager accessesthc  cntira collection of information about tho game from the LTM representation bf it.Tho itcms of knowledge in tho game, with tho particular parameters of this situationsubstituted apprcrpriatcly, fal l  into one of three categories:1.
Alrcady known to hearor (e.g.
HI ,  H2 & H11).
Items in this category aresimply icnorod, since it serves no purpose to re-assert them.2.
Contradict knowlcdgc already held by the hearer (e.g., i f  0 already k,ncw,for sure, that t knew all about Runoff).
I f  any item falls into this category, thehypothesis that this game is  active i s  simply abandoned as inaccurate.3.
Mtms ncithcr previously known or contradicted (the major i ty of thecontcnt of the typical case).
I n  this case, tho DGM creates activations ofthcsc items to  represent the collection of impl i t i t  knowledge that follows froma recognition of the proposed game.Rcsul ts: Activations are  created for all of the following:H5 = L wants to be able t o  get (Runoff workin$) himself.
(being able to  get (Runoff working) i s  a subgoalto  performing (Runoff working).

These items ofknowledte and goals are also established as activations by thaDGM at this time:Resutts: Activations are created or all of the following:HGx1 = L knows of an execution scene (XS/HE).HGx2 = L knows that i f  he perceives a particularterminal state of this scene, this wi l lsatisfy his wanting to  perform the task.HGX2C= (Thus) L wants to perceive this terminal stateA Modcl of Dialogueof XS/HE.A n  ACTION/GOODis mACTION with in the specification ofXS/HE whi'ch occurred in thc past.HGX3 = L knows that he has  pcrceivc tho ACTIQN/GOOD.HGX4 = L knows ho expected to perceive it.HGXS = L wantcd to  pcrccivc it.An ACTlON/BAD i s  an ACTION with in the specification ofXS/HE which has not occurred in  t h c  past,HGX6 z L knows he  has not perceived the ACTION/BAD.HGX7 = L knows hc expcctcd to perceive it,HGXB = L knows hc wanted to  pcrccivc it.

Sinca XS/RO is  more dctailad (conte in~more information) than XS/HE, XS/RO i s  used in place i f  XS/HE in all of the expressionsintroduced in Cycle 1-21.Something wo pnsscd ovcr in  thc earlier examples was tha issuo of vyhcn tho modcli s  willine to stop processing a given piece of tcxl and eo on la the nexf onc.
It scornsinappropriate l o  demand that tho rncdol wring all possiblo information end deductions outof each utterance.
Yet there must bo soms demands mada on tho assimilation.
A naltcrnatc form of tho question is: what ncedr of his own does the hearer see the incomingtext as potentially satisfyinc?
We have taken the position that a hearer (tentatively)understands an utterance, when he successfully views i t  as serving some goal imputed tothe spcskcr.
That is,  to a first approximation, the hearer has assimilated an utterance ifhc fisures out why thc spcakcr said it.Thc modcl has already established (HCX9 and HGX10, above) that L wants todcscribc (implicitly, to  0) certain action; in XS/RO b a t  L expected to perceive, and ins o n w  csscs, did, Thus, in thc following uttcrsnces, we see the modol matching theparsed input structure with one of thcsc two goals, thus it i s  sccn as bcing in service of agoal of thc spcakcr, and need bc examined no further (for tho time being).In thc subscqucnl example, we use two ncw rules: RS (Satisfaction) and RQ(Quicsccncc).
RS dctcrrnincs when an uttcranco i s  sccn to satisfy a speaker's goal andR Q ,  rcscts to  this dcfectcd satisfaction by marking the utterance quicsccnt.
(Opcrationolly, this means that in tho next cycle, thc Parser i s  called to input the nextscgmcnt af text.
