Text Generation for Strategic ComputingUSC/Information Sciences InstituteMarina del Rey, CA 90292Project Leaders: William Mann & Norman SondheimerProject Staff: Robert Albano, Susanna Cumming, Thomas Galloway, ChristianBernhard Nebel, Lynn Poulton, George Vamos, Richard WhitneyMatthiessen,1 ObjectivesThe US military is an information-rich, computer intensive organization.
It needs to have easy,understandable access to a wide variety of information.
Currently, information is often in obscurecomputer notations that are only understood after extensive training and practice.
Although easydiscourse between users and machines is an important objective for any situation, this issue isparticularly critical in regards to automated decision aids such as expert system based battlemanagement systems that have to carry on a dialog with a force commander.
A commander cain notafford to miss important information, nor is it reasonable to expect force commanders to undergohighly specialized training to understand obscure computer dialects which differ from machine tomachine.The great deal of work that has been done in the area of natural language understanding is startingto pay off with the delivery of functional interfaces that interact naturally with the user.
Comparativelylittle, however, has been done in the area of natural language generation.
Currently.
there is noeffective technology for expressing complex computer notations in ordinary English.
If there were.computer-based military information could be made more accessible and understandable in a mannerless subject to personnel changes.The Text Generation for Strategic Computing project is creating and demonstrating new technologyto provide an English-in, English-out interface to computer data to be embodied in a system calledJanus.
ISI is developing the English-out (text generation) portion of this overall system, a modulenamed Penman.
It's initial capability will be demonstrated on a naval database, but most of thetechniques are more .general and will be able to be reapplied to other military problems.
The endresult will be an exciting new capability for the military that produces answers to queries andcommands in the form of text that is understandable to any user who understands English.This project was put in place at the beginning of FY85 in order to develop the first natural languagegeneration capability robust and capable enough to be used in DARPA's Strategic ComputingProgram.
It is intended that this interface be coupled to the battle management system beingdeveloped under DARPA's Fleet Command Center Battle Management Program(FCCBMP).
In thefirst 1.5 years of the effort, we were able to demonstrate the first generation system to produceEnglish from output demands in formal mathematical ogic using a broad coverage grammar and anartificial intelligence knowledge base.
We have developed the basic technology that will permit therealization of a full text generation system.
In the next phase of the work, we will extend textgeneration from sentences to paragraphs, increase the power of the grammar, dictionary, andplanner, expand the knowledge base to cover more fully the battle management problem, optimize37and increase the robustness of the software, and tune the resulting system to the Navy problem.Finally, we will deliver our generation system to BBN, Inc, who will combine it with an understandingsystem for delivery to DARPA and subsequent integration with FCCBMP.This report details our approach, Penman's current status, and our plans for future work.2 Our ApproachBoth understanding and generation components are necessary in an effective information systeminterface.
It is also necessary that the technologies used by these two components be absolutelyconsistent.
If they are not, the embarrassing situation of the interface failing to understand a piece oftext which it has just output can occur, causing a lack of confidence in the system by users.In order to alleviate this problem, we are developing Penman in close cooperation with a naturallanguage understanding project at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman Inc. (BBN).
This cooperation extendsto joint development of knowledge representation software and lexicon design, and work to insurecompatibility between the RUS understanding grammar and the Nigel generation grammar.The understanding/generation compatibility effort can be considered the first of our goals for thePenman system.
Another is the ability to generate substantial amounts of English text, up to themultiparagraph level.
A useful interface should not be restricted to short replies or comments.A third goal is to make Penman as portable and domain independent as possible.
There are manyknowledge domains available for interface systems, and few specialists to create the interfaces.Thus.
we are emphasizing domain independent capabilities over domain dependent ones.Finally.
there are many linguistically and computationally significant issues that must be addressedif high quality generation is to be achieved.
For example, we are working on improved methods forknowledge representation, vocabulary development, and for using semantics and discourse contextto guide the generaiion of text.3 AccomplishmentsBy the time of this report, the project had created and delivered a Master Lexicon facility, called ML.for vocabulary acquisition and use \[Cumming 86a, Cumming 86b, Cumming 86c\].
ML is unusual inthat it is compatible with the two radically different grammars of English in Janus; the Nigel generationgrammar and the Rus understanding grammar.
The system features a multi.window bit mappeddisplay which is manipulatable through the keyboard and a mouse.
Online documentation is providedfor all lexical choices.
ML is built to allow for the extension of the Janus lexical system.
It is alsopossible to use ML with other natural language processing systems by replacement of a single datastructure.In addition, work has been done on bringing the Nigel and RUS grammars into compatibility.Our general goal is the development of natural language generation capabilities.
Our vehicle forthese capabilities will be a reusable module designed to meet al of a system's needs for generatedsentences.
The generation module must have an input notation in which demands for expression are38represented.
This notation should be of general  applicability.
For example, a good notation ought tobe generally useful in a reasoning system.
Also, the notation should have a wel l -def ined semanticsand the generator has to have some way of interpret ing the demands.
This interpretation has to beefficient.In our research, we have chosen to use formal logic as a demand language.
Networkknowledge-bases  are used to define the domain of discourse in order to help the generatorinterpret the logical forms.
And a restr icted,  hybr id  knowledge representat ion is utilized toanalyze demands for expression using the knowledge base \[Sondheimer 86\].
We have:1.
Developed a demand language, Penman Logical Form (PLF), based on first orderlogic \[USC/ISI 85\],2.
Structured a NIKL (New Implementation of KL-ONE) network \[Kaczmarek86\] to reflectconceptual distinctions observed by functional systemic linguists.3.
Developed a method for translation of demands for expression into a propositional logicdatabase.4.
Employed KL-TWO \[Vilain 85\] to analyze the translated demands, and5.
Used the results of the analyses to provide directions to the Nigel English sentencegeneration system \[Mann & Matthiessen 83\].To first order logic, PLF adds restricted quantification, i.e.. the ability to restrict the set quantifiedover.
In addition, we allow for equality and some related quantifiers and operators, such as thequantifier for "there exists exactly one ..." (3!).
the operator for "the one thing that ..." (L).
We permitthe formation and manipulation of sets.
including a predicate for set membership (ELEMENT-OF).And we have some quantifiers and operators based on Habel's 7//operator \[Habel 82\].Our system's knowledge has been organized in a new way in order to facilitate English expression.Abstract concepts corresponding to the major conceptual categories of English have been defined inNIKL (a KL-ONE dialect) and used to organize the conceptual hierarchy of the domain.
By definingconcepts such as process, event, quality, relationship and object in this way, fluent Englishexpression is facilitated.KL-TWO is a hybrid knowledge representation system that uses NIKL's formal semantics: KL.TWOlinks another reasoner, PENNI to NIKL.
For our purposes.
PENNI can be viewed as restricted toreasoning using propositional ogic.We translate a logical form into an equivalent KL-TWO structure.
All predications appearing in thelogical form are put into the PENNI database as assertions.
A separate tree is created which reflectsthe variable scoping.
Separate scopes are kept for the range restriction of a quantification and itspredication.The Nigel grammar and generator realizes the functional systemic framework at the" level ofsentence generation.
Within this framework, language is viewed as offering a set of grammaticalchoices to its speakers.
Speakers make their choices based on the information they wish to conveyand the discourse context they find themselves in.
Nigel captures the first of these notions by39organizing minimal sets of choices into systems.
The grammar is actually just a collection of thesesystems.
The factors the speaker considers in evaluating his communicative goal are shown byquestions called inquir ies inside of the chooser that is associated with each system.
A choicealternative in a system is chosen according to the responses to one or more of these inquiries.
It isthese inquiries which we have implemented.Our implementation of Nigel's inquiries using the connection and scope structures with the NIKLupper structure is fairly straightforward.
Since the logical forms reflecting the world view are in thehighest level of the NIKL model, the information decomposition inquiries use these structures to dosearch and retrieval.
With all of the predicates in the domain specializing concepts in the functionalsystemic level of the NIKL model, information characterization inquiries that consider aspects of theconnection structure can test for the truth of appropriate PENNI propositions.
The inquiries thatrelate to information presented in the quantification structure of the logical form will search the scopestructure.
Finally, to supply lexical entries, we associate lexical entries with NIKL concepts asattached data and use the retrieval methods of PENNI and NIKL to retrieve the appropriate terms.Although we have done some generation using the BBN naval knowledge base, our most extensiveexperience comes from the Consul knowledge domain of computer mail and calendars \[Kaczmarek.Mark, and Sondheimer 83\].
Using the developments above, translation from first-order logic toEnglish organized by NIKL has been demonstrated for a wide variety of sentence types.Table 3 shows a series of independent sentences that Penman is now able to generate.
We havearranged and labeled them to show how they might enter into computer database dialogue.Paraphrases in <brackets> show corresponding sentences of the type that will be generated fromNaval domain knowledge.Besides the technology described above, work has been done on aspects of discourse modeling.This included a study of object description and an initial noun phrase planner, which space does notallow us to detail.In order to produce the texts that are needed in a user assistance facility, work is under way to applyRhetorical Structure Theory to text planning.
A procedure has been developed which can designstructures for paragraph-length texts given information about the text goal and communicationsituation.4 Future EffortIn the next phase of our effort, Penman will be delivered to BBN, integrated into Janus, anddemonstrated in an extensive series of laboratory exercises.
This version of Penman will supportcoordinated English input and output, paraphrasing, and user assistance, as well as constructiverhetorical structure theory to create descriptive texts \[Mann 84\].For a machine to create fluent English texts, several problems of text organization and presentationmust be solved.
We will design, implement and demonstrate two kinds of new text planningprocesses.
One will be a planner for gross organization of text based on rhetorical structure theory,and the other a low level planner for sentence configurations.
In addition, we will examine the expertsystem explanation functionality necessary within FCCBMP and will design a text planner to meetthose needs.40Table 1: Sentences from Penman1.

As part of Janus, BBNplans to develop methods for translating English inputs into a higher order predicate calculus form.In addition, the logical form will be manipulated inside the BBN understanding component to reflectdatabase organization, expressions in this form are expected to be much more complex than thedirect expressions of the corresponding English, requiring multiple sentence expression.
Penmanwill be extended so that it can express these complex forms in English.Following successful completion of initial laboratory testing, Penman will be delivered to NOSC forknowledge base development and testing.
This Penman will have a basic text generation capabilitywith only limited capability for responding to the knowledge of the user and the state of the user-41machine interaction.
In subsequent years, these basic capabilities will be extensively expanded toprovide a much more useful interface, with particular development in the areas of user assistance,ability of the system to understand the user's knowledge and expectations, and needs for expertsystem explanation and user dialogue, as described below.Development of extensions is required in the area of user assistance functionality.
Text generationcan assist the user by explaining system actions and objects, and by clarifying its interpretation ofincoming English.
These capabilities must be integrated into the Janus interface in a natural, easy-to-use form.
We expect to demonstrate increased user assistance functionality as time goes on.Development of extensions is also required in the area of responsiveness to users' knowledge andexpectations.
This includes making the system aware of the ongoing topics and issues, what the userhas already been told, and what he can be expected to know without being told.
This in turn involvesmore extensive use of inference.
It also requires implementing a notion of the state of the dialogue --what things are in attention, what interactions are in process and what has been interrupted andsuspended.Penman is scheduled for use in an expert-system explanation context whose details are yet to bedetermined.
We will study what functionality is required in FCCBMP.
The study will lead to a designof code for this use of Penman.
Implementation and demonstration of full functionality are expectedfollowing the user assistance work.42References\[Cumming 86a\] Susanna Cumming, Design of a Master Lexicon, USC/Information Sciences Institute,Marina del Rey,CA, Technical Report ISI/RR-85-163, February 1986.\[Cumming 86b\] Susanna Cumming, Robert Albano, A Guide to Lexical Acquisition in the JANUSSystem, USC/Information Sciences Institute, Marina del Rey,CA, Technical ReportISI/RR-85-162, February 1986.\[Cumming 86c\] Susanna Cumming, The Lexicon in Text Generation, USC/Information SciencesInstitute, Marina del Rey,CA, Technical Report ISI/RR-86-168, 1986.
