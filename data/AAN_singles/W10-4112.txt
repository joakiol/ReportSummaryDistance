In the pre-processing stage, the maximal noun phrases ina sentence are recognized and replaced by?NP?
labels to simplify the sentence structure.Then a CRF model is trained to recognize thepredicate heads of this simplified sentence.
Inthe post-processing stage, a rule base is builtaccording to the grammatical features ofpredicate heads.
It is then utilized to correctthe preliminary recognition results.
Experi-mental results show that our approach is feasi-ble and effective, and its accuracy achieves89.14% on Tsinghua Chinese Treebank.1 IntroductionIt is an important issue to identify predicates insyntactic analysis.
In general, a predicate is con-sidered the head of a sentence.
In Chinese, itusually organizes two parts into a well-formedsentence, one with a subject and its adjunct, andthe other with an object and/or complement (Luoet al, 1994).
Accurate identification of predicatehead is thus critical in determining the syntacticstructure of a sentence.
Moreover, a predicatehead splitting a long sentence into two shorterparts can alleviate the complexity of syntacticanalysis to a certain degree.
This is particularlyuseful when long dependency relations are in-volved.
Without doubt, this is also a difficult taskin Chinese dependency parsing (Cheng et al,2005).Predicate head identification also plays an im-portant role in facilitating various tasks of naturallanguage processing.
For example, it enhancesshallow parsing (Sun et al, 2000) and head-driven parsing (Collins, 1999), and also improvesthe precision of sentence similarity computation(Sui et al, 1998a).
There is reason to expect it tobe more widely applicable to other tasks, e.g.machine translation, information extraction, andquestion answering.In this paper, we propose an effective ap-proach to automatically recognize predicateheads of Chinese sentences based on a preproc-essing step for maximal noun phrases 1(MNPs).MNPs usually appear in the location of subjectand object in a sentence.
The proper identifica-tion of them is thus expected to assist the analy-sis of sentence structure and/or improve the ac-curacy of predicate head recognition.In the next section, we will first review somerelated works and discuss their limitations, fol-lowed by a detailed description of the task ofrecognizing predicate heads in Section 3.
Section4 illustrates our proposed approach and Section 5presents experiments and results.
Finally weconclude the paper in Section 6.2 Related WorksThere exist various approaches to identify predi-cate heads in Chinese sentences.
Luo and Zheng(1994) and Tan (2000) presented two rule-basedmethods based on contextual features and part ofspeeches.
A statistical approach was presented inSui and Yu (1998b), which utilizes a decisiontree model.
Gong et al (2003) presented theirhybrid method combining both rules and statis-tics.
These traditional approaches only make useof the static and dynamic grammatical features ofthe quasi-predicates to identify the predicateheads.
On this basis, Li and Meng (2005) pro-posed a method to further utilize syntactic rela-tions between the subject and the predicate in asentence.
Besides the above monolingual pro-posals, Sui and Yu (1998a) discussed a bilingualstrategy to recognize predicate heads in Chinese1 Maximal noun phrase is the noun phrase which is not con-tained by any other noun phrases.sentences with reference to those in their coun-terpart English sentences.Nevertheless, these methods have their ownlimitations.
The rule-based methods require ef-fective linguistic rules to be formulated by lin-guists according to their own experience.
Cer-tainly, this is impossible to cover all linguisticsituations concerned, due to the complexity oflanguage and the limitations of human observa-tion.
In practice, we also should not underesti-mate the complexity of feature application, thecomputing power demanded and the difficultiesin handing irregular sentence patterns.
For in-stance, a sentence without subject may lead to anincorrect recognition of predicate head.
For cor-pus-based approaches, they rely on language datain huge size but the available data may not beadequate.
Those bilingual methods may first en-counter the difficulty of determining correct sen-tence alignment in the case that the parallel dataconsist of much free translation.Our method proposed here focuses on a simplebut effective means to help identify predicateheads, i.e., MNP pre-processing.
At present,there has some substantial progress in automaticrecognition of MNP.
Zhou et al (2000) proposedan efficient algorithm for identifying ChineseMNPs by using their structure combination,achieving an 85% precision and an 82% recall.Dai et al (2008) presented another method basedon statistics and rules, reaching a 90% F-score onHIT Chinese Treebank.
Jian et al (2009) em-ployed both left-right and right-left sequentiallabeling and developed a novel ?fork position?based probabilistic algorithm to fuse bidirec-tional results, obtaining an 86% F-score on thePenn Chinese Treebank.
Based on these previousworks, we have developed an approach that firstidentifies the MNPs in a sentence, which are thenused in determining the predicate heads in thenext stage.3 Task  DescriptionThe challenge of accurate identification of predi-cate heads is to resolve the problem of quasi-predicate heads in a sentence.
On the one hand,the typical POSs of predicate heads in Chinesesentences are verbs, adjectives and descriptivewords 2 .
Each of them may have multiple in-stances in a sentence.
On the other hand, while asimple sentence has only one predicate head, acomplex sentence may have multiple ones.
The2 We only focus on Verbs and adjectives in this work.latter constitutes 8.25% in our corpus.
Thus, thereal difficulty lies in how to recognize the truepredicate head of a sentence among so manypossibilities.Take a simple sentence as example:?/rN ?/qN ?/v ?
?/a ?
?/n ?/uJDE ?/a ?/n ?
?/v ?
?/aD ?/uJDE ?
?/v ?/n ?/cC ?
?/v ?/n ?/wEThe quasi-predicate heads (verbs and adjectives)include ?/v, ?
?/a, ?/a, ?
?/v, ?
?/v,and ??/v.
However, there are two MNPs inthis sentence, namely, ?
?/rN ?/qN ?/v ?
?/a ?
?/n ?/uJDE ?/a ?/n?
and ??
?/aD?/uJDE ?
?/v ?/n ?/cC ?
?/v ?/n?.These two MNPs cover most quasi-predicateheads in the sentence, except ?
?/v, the truepredicate head that we want.An MNP is a complete semantic unit, and itsinternal structure may include different kinds ofconstituents (Jian et al, 2009).
Therefore, thefundamental structure of a sentence can be madeclear after recognizing its MNPs.
This can helpfilter out those wrong quasi-predicates for a bet-ter shortlist of good candidates for the true predi-cate head in a sentence.In practice, the identification of predicate headbegins with recognizing MNPs in the same sen-tence.
It turns the above example sentence into:[ ?/rN ?/qN ?/v ?
?/a ?
?/n ?/uJDE ?/a ?/n ] ?
?/v [ ?
?/aD?/uJDE ?
?/v ?/n ?/cC ?
?/v ?/n ] ?/wEThese MNPs are then replaced with the conven-tional label ?NP?
for noun phrase, resulting in asimplified sentence structure as follows.NP/NP  ?
?/v  NP/NP ?/wEThis basic sentence structure can largely allevi-ates the complexity of the original sentence andnarrows down the selection scope of quasi-predicates for the true head.
In this particularexample, the only verb left in the sentence afterMNP recognition is the true predicate head.4 Predicate Head IdentificationThis section describes the process of identifyingpredicate heads in sentences.
As illustrated inFigure 1 below, it can be divided into three steps:Step 1: recognize the MNPs in a sentence andreplace the MNPs with ?NP?
label to simplifythe sentence structure.Step 2: recognize the predicate heads in theresulted simplified structure.Step 3: post-process the preliminary results tocorrect the wrong predicate heads according toheuristics in a rule base.4.1 MNP RecognitionThe MNP recognition is performed via a trainedCRF model on unlabeled data.
We adopt themethod in Dai et al (2008), with modified tem-plates for the different corpus.
Each feature iscomposed of the words and POS tags surround-ing the current word i, as well as different com-bination of them.
The context window of tem-plate is set to size 3.
Table 1 shows the featuretemplate we use.Type FeaturesUnigram Wordi PosiBigram Wordi/PosiSurrounding Wordi-1/Wordi Posi-1/PosiWordi/Wordi+1 Posi/Posi+1Wordi-2/Posi-2 Posi-2/Posi-1Posi-2/Posi-1/Posi Posi-3/Posi-2Posi-1/Posi/Posi+1 Wordi+3/Posi+3Posi+1/Posi+2/Posi+3 Wordi+2/Wordi+3Table 1: Feature TemplateTest data Final resultsPreliminarFigure 1: Flow Chart of Predicate Head IdentificationThe main effective factors for MNPs recogni-tion are the lengths of MNPs and the complexityof sentence in question.
We analyze the lengthdistribution of MNPs in TCT 3  corpus, findingthat their average length is 6.24 words and thelongest length is 119 words.
Table 2 presents thisdistribution in detail.Length of MNP Occurrences Percentage (%)len?5 3260 48.825?len?10 2348 35.17len?10 1069 16.01Table 2: Length Distribution of MNPs in TCT CorpusThe MNPs longer than 5 words cover 50% oftotal occurrences, indicating the relatively highcomplexity of sentences.
We trained a CRFmodel using this data set, which achieves an F-score of 83.7% on MNP recognition.4.2 Predicate Head IdentificationAfter the MNPs in a sentence are recognized,they are replaced by ?NP?
label to rebuild a sim-plified sentence structure.
It largely reduces thedifficulty in identifying predicate heads from thissimplified structure.We evaluate our models by their precision inthe test set, which is formulated as3 Tsinghua Chinese Treebank ver1.0._100%_right sentencesPrecisionSum sentences= ?
(1)The right_sentences refer to the number of sen-tences whose predicate heads are successfullyidentified, and the sum_sentences to the totalnumber of sentences in the test set.
We count asentence as right_sentence if and only if all itspredicate heads are successfully identified, in-cluding those with multiple predicate heads.For each predicate head, we need an appropri-ate feature representation f (i, j).
We test themodel performance with different context win-dow sizes of template.
The results are shown inTable 3 as follows.Template Context window size Precision (%)Temp1 2 79.27Temp2 3 82.59Temp3 4 81.37Table 3: Precisions of Predicate Heads Recognition underDifferent Context Window SizesIt shows that the window size of 3 words givesthe highest precision (82.59%).
Therefore weapply this window size, together with other fea-tures in our CRF model, including words, POSs,phrase tags and their combinations.
There are 24template types in total.4.3 Post-processingThe post-processing stage is intended to correcterrors in the preliminary identification results ofMNP recognition MNP replacement Predicate head recognition y resultsPredicate head recognition model Rule base MNP recognition modelpredicate heads, by applying linguistic rules for-mulated heuristically.
We test each rule to see ifit improves the recognition accuracy, so as toretrieve a validated rule base.
The labeling ofpredicate heads follows the standard of TCT anda wrong labeling is treated as an error.There are three main types of error, accordingto our observation.
The first is that no predicatehead is identified.
The second is that the wholesentence is recognized as an MNP, such that nopredicate head is recognized.
The third is that thepredicate head is incorrectly identified, such as???
in the expression ??????
?, where thecorrect answer is ????
according to the TCTstandard.Error types Percentage Improved  percentageNo predicate head 17.50% 2.44%a sentence as an MNP 10.63% 1.11%???????
8.75% 0.56%Others 63.12% 2.77%Table 4: Types of ErrorTable 4 lists different types of error, togetherwith their percentage in all sentences whosepredicate heads have been mistakenly identified,and the improvement in percentage after thepost-processing.
To correct these errors, a num-ber of rules for post-processing are formulated.The main rules are the followings:?
If no predicate head is recognized in a sen-tence, we label the first verb as the predi-cate head.Error sample?
?/p [ ???
?/m ?/qT ???
?/nR ] ?/f ?/wP [ ?
?/nS ??/d?
?/v ???
?/b ??
?/b ?
?/n ] ?/wECorrected?
?/p [ ???
?/m ?/qT ???
?/nR ] ?/f ?/wP [ ?
?/nS ??/d?
?/v ???
?/b ??
?/b ?
?/n ] ?/wE?
If the whole sentence is recognized as anMNP, such that no predicate head is identi-fied, we label the first verb as the predicatehead.Error sample?

?/n ] ?/wECorrected?
[ ?

?/n ] ?/wE?
For expression ??????

?/n ?/vC [ ?/d ?/v ???
?/n ?/cC ???
?/n ?
?/n ?/uJDE??
?/b ?
?/n ] ?/wEThere are also other rules in the rule base be-sides the above ones.
For example, if the firstword of a sentences is ???
or ???
?, it is la-beled as the predicate head.5 Experiments5.1 Data SetsOur experiments are carried out on the TsinghuaChinese Treebank (TCT).
Every constituent of asentence in TCT is labeled by human expert.
Werandomly extract 5000 sentences from TCT andremove those sentences that do not have predi-cate head.
Finally, our data set contains 4613sentences, in which 3711 sentences are randomlychosen as training data and 902 sentences as test-ing data.
The average length of these sentencesin training set is 20 words.The number of quasi-predicate heads in a sen-tence is a critical factor to determine the per-formance of predicate head recognition.
Reduc-ing the number of quasi-predicate heads can im-prove the recognition precision.
Table 5 showsthe percentage of quasi-predicate heads in train-ing data before and after MNP replacement.Number ofquasi-predicatesPercentage beforeMNP replace-ment(%)Percentage afterMNP replace-ment(%)1 12.50 49.692 19.62 27.223 20.37 12.37>3 47.51 10.72Table 5: The Percentage of Quasi-predicate Heads Beforeand After MNP ReplacementFrom Table 5, we can see that almost half sen-tences contain more than three quasi-predicateheads.
Only 12.5% of sentences have only onequasi-predicate head before MNP replacement.However, after MNPs are replaced with the ?NP?label, only 10.72% contain more than threequasi-predicate heads and nearly 50% containonly one quasi-predicate head.
We have evidencethat MNP pre-processing can reduce the numberof quasi-predicate heads and lower the complex-ity of sentence structures.5.2 Results and DiscussionFor comparison purpose, we developed four dif-ferent models for predicate head recognition.Models 1 and 2 are CRF models, the former rec-ognizing predicate heads directly and the laterrecognizing MNPs at the same time.
Model 3recognizes predicate heads based on MNP pre-processing.
Model 4 is based on model 3, includ-ing the post-processing stage.
Table 6 shows therecognition performance of each model using thebest context window size.Model Context window sizeNumber of cor-rect sentencesPreci-sion(%)model 1 4 680 75.39model 2 4 687 76.16model 3 3 745 82.59model 4 3 804 89.14Table 6: Performance of Different ModelsComparing these models, we can see that theadditional feature in model 2 leads to 1% im-provement in precision over model 1.
Moreover,the MNP pre-processing in model 3 results in alarge increase in accuracy, compared to model 1.It indicates that the MNP pre-processing doesimprove the precision of recognition.
Comparedwith model 3, model 4 achieves a precision even6.55% higher, indicating that the post-processingis also an effective step for recognition.As shown, the performance is affected by theeffect of MNP recognition.
There are three kindsof relation between the predicate heads and thetypes of MNP recognition error:Relation 1: The whole sentence is recognizedas an MNP.Relation 2: The boundaries of an MNP are in-correctly recognized and the MNP does not con-tain the predicate head.Relation 3: The boundaries of an MNP are in-correctly recognized and the MNP contains thepredicate head.
Table 7 shows the distribution ofthese three relations in the recognition errors.Relation Number of sentences Percentage(%)Relation 1 17 5.47Relation 2  281 90.35Relation 3 13 4.18Table 7: Distribution of the Three Relations inRecognition ErrorsIn our approach, the errors of relation 1 andrelation 3 can be solved by the post-processing,as presented in Section 4.3.
Relation 2 holds thelargest proportion among the three.
But the errorrate of predicate head recognition only reaches31.67% in this case.
That is to say, although theMNP boundaries are incorrectly recognized, theaccuracy of predicate head recognition can stillreach 68.33%.Chen (2007) proposed a probabilistic model(model 5) for recognizing predicate heads in Chi-nese sentences.
The probabilities of quasi-predicates are estimated by maximum likelihoodestimation.
A discounted model is used tosmooth parameters.
We compare his model withour model 3 using different contextual featureson TCT corpus.
Table 8 shows the comparisonresults.The highest precision of model 3 is 82.59%when the context window size is set to 3.
Formodel 5, it is 70.62% at a context window size of4.
Experimental results show that the precision ofour method is about 12% higher than Chen?s.Context window size Model Precision (%)model 5 69.18 2model 3 79.27model 5 70.183model 3 82.59model 5 70.624model 3 81.37Table 8: Comparison between model 3 and Chen?s modelBeside Chen?s method, the Stanford Parsercan also recognize the predicate heads in simpleChinese sentences.
The root node of dependencytree is the predicate head.
For a comparison, werandomly extract two hundred simple sentencesin our test data to compare it with the outputs ofour model 3.
We also train a model of predicatehead recognition (model 6), which assumes thatall MNPs are successfully identified.
The com-parison is shown in Table 9.
We can see that theprecision of model 6 is 8.35% higher than model3.
This means that our method still has a certainroom for further improvement.Stanford Parser model 3 model678.17% 83.15% 91.5%Table 9: Comparison between model 3 and StanfordParser5.3 Error AnalysisAs shown above, the post-processing can correctmost errors in the recognition of predicate heads.But we also observe some errors that cannot becorrected this way.
For example,??
?/n?/p ??
?/n ?
?/v [ ??/n?
?/n ] ?
?/v ?/wEThe predicate head here is ???
?, but usually????
is recognized as the predicate head.
Thisis because ????
can be used either as a verb ora noun.
There are many verbs of this kind in Chi-nese, such as ???
?
and ???
?.
Mistakescaused by the flexibility of Chinese verb and theambiguity of sentence structure appear to deservemore of our effort.
Meanwhile, there are alsosome other unusual cases that cannot be properlysolved with statistical methods.6 ConclusionIdentification of predicate heads is important tosyntactic parsing.
In this paper, we have pre-sented a novel method that combines both statis-tical and rule-based approaches to identify predi-cate heads based on MNP pre-processing andrule-based post-processing.
We have had a seriesof experiments to show that this method achievesa significant improvement over some state-of-the-art approaches.
Furthermore, it also providesa simple structure of sentence that can be utilizedfor parsing.In the future, we will study how semantic in-formation can be applied to further improve theprecision of MNP recognition and predicate headidentification.
It is also very interesting to ex-plore how this approach can facilitate parsing,including shallow parsing.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the anonymous review-ers for their helpful comments and suggestions.We also thank Billy Wong of City University ofHong Kong for his much-appreciated input dur-ing the writing process.ReferencesZhiqun Chen.
