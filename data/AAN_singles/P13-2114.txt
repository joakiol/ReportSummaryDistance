Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 645?650,Sofia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c?2013 Association for Computational LinguisticsTemporal Signals Help Label Temporal RelationsLeon Derczynski and Robert GaizauskasNatural Language Processing GroupDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of Sheffield211 Portobello, S1 4DP, Sheffield, UK{leon,robertg}@dcs.shef.ac.ukAbstractAutomatically determining the temporal orderof events and times in a text is difficult, thoughhumans can readily perform this task.
Some-times events and times are related through useof an explicit co-ordination which gives infor-mation about the temporal relation: expres-sions like ?before?
and ?as soon as?.
We in-vestigate the ro?le that these co-ordinating tem-poral signals have in determining the type oftemporal relations in discourse.
Using ma-chine learning, we improve upon prior ap-proaches to the problem, achieving over 80%accuracy at labelling the types of temporal re-lation between events and times that are re-lated by temporal signals.1 IntroductionIt is important to understand time in language.
Theability to express and comprehend expressions of timeenables us to plan, to tell stories, and to discuss changein the world around us.When we automatically extract temporal informa-tion, we are often concerned with events and times ?
re-ferred to collectively as temporal intervals.
We mightask, for example, ?Who is the current President of theUSA?.?
In order to extract an answer to this questionfrom a document collection, we need to identify eventsrelated to persons becoming president and the times ofthose events.
Crucially, however, we also need to iden-tify the temporal relations between these events andtimes, perhaps, for example, by recognizing a tempo-ral relation type from a set such as that of Allen (1983).This last task, temporal relation typing, is challeng-ing, and is the focus of this paper.Temporal signals are words or phrases that act asdiscourse markers that co-ordinate a pair of events ortimes and explicitly state the nature of the temporal re-lation that holds between them.
For example, in ?Theparade reached the town hall before noon?, the wordbefore is a temporal signal, co-ordinating the eventreached with the time noon.
Intuitively, these signalwords act as discourse contain temporal ordering infor-mation that human readers can readily access, and in-deed this hypothesis is borne out empirically (Bestgenand Vonk, 1999).
In this paper, we present an in-depthexamination into the role temporal signals can play inmachine learning for temporal relation typing, withinthe framework of TimeML (Pustejovsky et al, 2005).2 Related WorkTemporal relation typing is not a new problem.
Clas-sical work using TimeML is that of Boguraev andAndo (2005), Mani et al (2007) and Yoshikawa et al(2009).
The TempEval challenge series features re-lation typing as a key task (Verhagen et al, 2009).The take-home message from all this work is that tem-poral relation typing is a hard problem, even usingadvanced techniques and extensive engineering ?
ap-proaches rarely achieve over 60% on typing relationsbetween two events or over 75% accuracy for those be-tween an event and a time.
Recent attempts to includemore linguistically sophisticated features representingdiscourse, syntactic and semantic role information haveyielded but marginal improvements, e.g.
Llorens et al(2010); Mirroshandel et al (2011).Although we focus solely on determining the typesof temporal relations, one must also identify whichpairs of temporal intervals should be temporally re-lated.
Previous work has covered the tasks of identi-fying and typing temporal relations jointly with somesuccess (Denis and Muller, 2011; Do et al, 2012).
TheTempEval3 challenge addresses exactly this task (Uz-Zaman et al, 2013).Investigations into using signals for temporal rela-tion typing have had promising results.
Lapata andLascarides (2006) learn temporal structure accordingto these explicit signals, then predict temporal order-ings in sentences without signals.
As part of an earlyTempEval system, Min et al (2007) automatically an-notate signals and associate them with temporal rela-tions.
They then include the signal text as a featurefor a relation type classifier.
Their definition of sig-nals varies somewhat from the traditional TimeML sig-645Event-event relations Event-time relationsNon-signalled Signalled Overall Non-signalled Signalled OverallBaseline most-common-class 41.4% 57.4% 43.0% 49.2% 51.6% 49.6%Maxent classifier 57.7% 58.6% 57.8% 81.4% 59.6% 77.3%Error reduction 27.8% 2.74% 25.4% 64.5% 16.4% 55.5%Sample size (number of relations) 3 179 343 3 522 2 299 529 2 828Table 1: Relation typing performance using the base feature set, for relations with and without a temporal signal.nal definition, as they include words such as reportingwhich would otherwise be annotated as an event.
Thesystem achieves a 22% error reduction on a simplifiedset of temporal relation types.Later, Derczynski and Gaizauskas (2010) saw a 50%error reduction in assignment of relation types on sig-nalled relation instances from introducing simple fea-tures describing a temporal signal?s interaction with theevents or times that it co-ordinates.
The features for de-scribing signals included the signal text itself and thesignal?s position in the document relative to the inter-vals it co-ordinated.
This led to a large increase in re-lation typing accuracy to 82.19% for signalled event-event relations, using a maximum entropy classifier.Previous work has attempted to linguistically charac-terise temporal signals (Bre?e et al, 1993; Derczynskiand Gaizauskas, 2011).
Signal phrases typically fallinto one of three categories: monosemous as temporalsignals (e.g.
?during?, ?when?
); bisemous as temporalor spatial signals (e.g.
?before?
); or polysemous withthe temporal sense a minority class (e.g.
?in?, ?fol-lowing?).
Further, a signal phrase may take two argu-ments, though its arguments need not be in the imme-diate content and may be anaphoric.
We leave the taskof automatic signal annotation to future work, insteadfocusing on the impact that signals have on temporalrelation typing.Our work builds on previous work by expanding thestudy to include relations other than just event-eventrelations, by extending the feature set, by doing tem-poral relation labelling over a more carefully curatedversion of the TimeBank corpus (see below), and byproviding detailed analysis of the performance of a setof labelling techniques when using temporal signals.3 Experimental SetupWe only approach the relation typing task, and we useexisting signal annotations ?
that is, we do not attemptto automatically identify temporal signals.The corpus used is the signal-curated version ofTimeBank (Pustejovsky et al, 2003).
This corpus, TB-sig,1 adds extra events, times and relations to Time-Bank, in an effort to correct signal under-annotation inthe original corpus (Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2011).Like the original TimeBank corpus, it comprises 183documents.
In these, we are interested only in the tem-poral relations that use a signal.
There are 851 signalsannotated in the corpus, co-ordinating 886 temporal re-1See http://derczynski.com/sheffield/resources/tb sig.tar.bz2lations (13.7% of all).
For comparison, TimeBank has688 signal annotations which co-ordinate 718 temporalrelations (11.2%).When evaluating classifiers, we performed 10-foldcross-validation, keeping splits at document level.There are only 14 signalled time-time relations in thiscorpus, which is not enough to support any generaliza-tions, and so we disregard this interval type pairing.As is common with statistical approaches to tempo-ral relation typing, we also perform relation folding;that is, to reduce the number of possible classes, wesometimes invert argument order and relation type.
Forexample, A BEFORE B and B AFTER A convey thesame temporal relation, and so we can remove all AF-TER-type relations by swapping their argument orderand converting them to BEFORE relations.
This loss-less process condenses the labels that our classifier hasto distinguish between, though classification remains amulti-class problem.We adopt the base feature set of Mani et al (2007),which consists mainly of TimeML event and timeannotation surface attributes.
These are, for events:class, aspect, modality, tense, polarity, partof speech; and, for times: value, type, functionin document, mod, quant.
To these are addedsame-tense and same-aspect features, as well asthe string values of events/times.The feature groups we use here are:?
Base ?
The attributes of TimeML annotations in-volved (includes tense, aspect, polarity and so onas above), as with previous approaches.?
Argument Ordering ?
Two features: a booleanset if both arguments are in the same sentence (asin Chambers et al (2007)), and the text order ofargument intervals (as in Hepple et al (2007)).?
Signal Ordering ?
Textual ordering is importantwith temporal signals; compare ?You walk beforeyou run?
and ?Before you walk you run?.
Weadd features accounting for relative textual posi-tion of signal and arguments as per Derczynskiand Gaizauskas (2010).
To these we add a featurereporting whether the signal occurs in first, last,or mid-sentence position, and features to indicatewhether each interval is in the same sentence asthe signal.?
Syntactic ?
We add syntactic features: fol-lowing Bethard et al (2007), the lowest com-mon constituent label between each argument and646Features Classifier Event-event accuracy Event-time accuracyN/A Baseline most-common-class 57.4% 51.6%Base Baseline maximum entropy 58.6% 59.6%Maximum entropy 72.6% 72.4%DG2010 Random forest 76.7% 78.6%AllAdaptive boosting 70.4% 73.0%Na?

These features are generated using theStanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and afunction tagger (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000).?
Signal Text ?
We add the signal?s raw string, aswell as its lower-case version and its lemma.?

For event-time relations, whether the timeexpression also functions as the document?s cre-ation timestamp.Collectively, these feature groups comprise the Allfeature set.
For comparison, the feature set we reportedin previous work (Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2010)is also included, labeled DG2010.
This set contains thebase and the signal ordering feature groups only, plus asingle signal feature for the signal raw string.Using these feature representations we trained multi-nomial na?
?ve Bayes (Rennie et al, 2003), maximumentropy (Daume?
III, 2008), adaptive boosting (Fre-und and Schapire, 1997; Zhu et al, 2009), multi-classSVM (Crammer and Singer, 2002; Chang and Lin,2011) and random forest2 (Breiman, 2001) classifiersvia Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al, 2011).We use two baselines: most-common-class and amodel trained with no signal features.
We also in-troduce two measures replicating earlier work: oneusing the DG2010 features and the classifier used inthat work (maximum entropy), and another using theDG2010 features with the best-performing classifierunder our All feature set, in order to see if performancechanges are due to features or classifier.Classifiers were evaluated by determining if the classthey output matched the relation type in TB-sig.
Re-sults are given in Table 2.
For comparison with thegeneral case, i.e.
for both signalled and non-signalledtemporal relation instances, we list performance witha maximum entropy classifier and the base feature set2With nestimators = 200, a minimum of one sample pernode, and no maximum depth.Figure 1: Effect of training data size on relation typingperformance.on TB-sig?s temporal relations.
Results are in Table 1.These are split into those that use a signal and those thatdo not, though no features relaying signal informationare included.In order to assess the adequacy of the dataset interms of size, we also examined performance using amaximum entropy classifier learned from varying sub-proportions of the training data.
This was measuredover event-event relations, using all features.
Resultsare given in Figure 1.
That performance appears to sta-bilise and level off indicates that the training set is ofsufficient size for these experiments.4 AnalysisThe results in Table 2 echo earlier findings and intu-ition: temporal signals are useful in temporal relationtyping.
Results support that signals are not only helpfulin event-event relation typing but also event-time typ-ing.
For comparison, inter-annotator agreement acrossall temporal relation labels, i.e.
signalled and non-signalled relations, in TimeBank is 77%.Using the maximum entropy classifier, our approachgives a 2.9% absolute performance increase over theDG2010 feature set for event-event relations (10.6% er-ror reduction) and a 5.7% absolute increase for event-time relations (20.7% error reduction).

17.6% for event-event, 7.9% for event-time relations.
Linear support vector classification pro-vided rapid labelling and comparable performance forevent-event relations but was accuracy was not as goodas random forests for event-time relation labelling.Note, figures reported earlier in Derczynski andGaizauskas (2010) are not directly comparable to theDG2010 figures reported here, as here we are using thebetter-annotated TB-sig corpus, which contains a largerand more varied set of temporal signal annotations.Although we are only examining the 13.7% of tem-poral relations that are co-ordinated with a signal, itis important to note the performance of conventionalclassification approaches on this subset of temporalrelations.
Specifically, the error reduction relative tothe baseline that is achieved without signal features ismuch lower on relations that use signals than on non-signalled relations (Table 1).
Thus, temporal relationsthat use a signal appear to be more difficult to clas-sify than other relations, unless signal information ispresent in the features.
This may be due to differencesin how signals are used by authors.
One explanationis that signals may be used in the stead of temporal or-dering information in surrounding discourse, such asmodulations of dominant tense or aspect (Derczynskiand Gaizauskas, 2013).Unlike earlier work using maxent, we experimentwith a variety of classifiers, and find a consistent im-provement in temporal relation typing using signal fea-tures.
With the notable exception of adaptive boost-ing, classifiers with preference bias (Liu et al, 2002)?
AdaBoost, random trees and SVC ?
performed bestin this task.
Conversely, those tending toward the in-dependence assumption (na?
?ve Bayes and maxent) didnot capitalise as effectively on the training data.Features Evt-evt Evt-timeAll 80.8% 80.3%All-signal text 70.8% 72.7%All-signal text-argument order 70.7% 72.2%All-signal text-signal order 69.5% 71.2%All-signal text-syntax 59.5% 69.0%All-signal text-DCT 70.8% 72.8%Table 4: Feature ablation without signal text features.Bold figures indicate largest performance change.We also investigated the impact of each featuregroup on the best-performing classifier (random forestswith n = 200) through feature ablation.
Results aregiven in Table 3.
Ablation suggested that the signal textfeatures (signal string, lower case string, head word andlemma) had most impact in event-event relation typing,though were second to syntax features in event-time re-lations.
Removing other feature groups gave only mi-nor performance decreases.We also experimented with adding feature groups tothe base set one-by-one.
All but DCT features gaveabove-baseline improvement, though argument order-ing features were not very helpful for event-event re-lation typing.
Signal text features gave the strongestimprovement over baseline for event-event relations,but syntax gave a larger improvement for event-timerelations.
Accordingly, it may be useful to distinguishbetween event-event and event-time relations when ex-tracting temporal information using syntax (c.f.
the ap-proach of Wang et al (2010)).A strong above-baseline performance was still ob-tained even when signal text features were removed,which included the signal text itself.
This was interest-ing, as signal phrases can indicate quite different tem-poral orderings (e.g.
?Open the box while it rains?
vs.?Open the box before it rains?, and the words used aretypically critical to correct interpretation of the tempo-ral relation.
Further, the model is able to generalisebeyond particular signal phrase choices.
To investigatefurther, we examined the performance impact of eachgroup sans ?signal text?
features (Table 4).
In this case,removing the syntactic features had the greatest (neg-ative) impact on performance, though the absolute im-pact on event-event relations (a drop of 11.3%) was farlower than that on event-time relations (3.7%).To examine helpful features, we trained a max-ent classifier on the entire dataset and collected fea-ture:value pairs.
These were then ranked by theirweight.
The ten largest-weighted pairings for event-event relations (the hardest problem in overall temporalrelation typing) are given in Table 5.
Prefixes of 1- and2- correspond to the two interval arguments (events).Negative values are those where the presence of a par-ticular feature:value pair suggests the mentioned classis not applicable.648Weight Feature Value Class9.346 2-polarity POS ENDS-8.713 1-2-same-sent True BEGINS-7.861 2-aspect NONE BEGINS-7.256 1-aspect NONE INCLUDES6.564 2-sig-synt-path NN-NP-IN INCLUDES6.519 signal-lower before ENDS-6.294 2-tense NONE BEGINS-5.908 2-modality None ENDS5.643 2-text took BEGINS-5.580 1-modality None ENDSTable 5: Top ten largest-weighted feature:value pairs.It can be seen that BEGINS and INCLUDES rela-tionships are not indicated if the arguments have noTimeML aspect assigned; this is what one might ex-pect, given how aspect is used in English, with thesetemporal relation types corresponding to event startsand the progressive.
Also, notice how a particular syn-tactic path, connecting adjacent nominalised event andthe word in acting as a signal, indicate a temporal inclu-sion relationship.
Temporal polysemy, where a wordhas more than one possible temporal interpretation,is also observable here (Derczynski and Gaizauskas(2011) examine this polysemy in depth).
This is vis-ible in how the temporal signal phrase ?before?
is not,as one might expect, a strong indicator of a BEFORE oreven AFTER relation, but of an ENDS relationship.5 ConclusionThis paper set out to investigate the ro?le of temporalsignals in predicting the type of temporal relation be-tween two intervals.
The paper demonstrated the util-ity of temporal signals in this task, and identified ap-proaches for using the information these signals con-tain, which performed consistently better than the state-of-the-art across a range of machine learning classi-fiers.
Further, it identified the impact that signal text,signal order and syntax features had in temporal rela-tion typing of signalled relations.Two directions of future work are indicated.
Firstly,the utility of signals prompts investigation into detect-ing which words in a given text occur as temporal sig-nals.
Secondly, it is intuitive that temporal signals ex-plicitly indicate related pairs of intervals (i.e.
events ortimes).
So, the task of deciding which interval pair(s) atemporal signal co-ordinates must be approached.Although we have found a method for achievinggood temporal relation typing performance on a subsetof temporal relations, the greater problem of generaltemporal relation typing remains.
A better understand-ing of the semantics of events, times, signals and howthey are related together through syntax may providefurther insights into the temporal relation typing task.Finally, Bethard et al (2007) reached high temporalrelation typing performance on one a subset of relations(events and times in the same sentence); we reach hightemporal relation typing performance on another subsetof relations ?
those using a temporal signal.
Identify-ing further explicit sources of temporal information ap-plicable to new sets of relations may reveal promisingpaths for investigation.AcknowledgementsThe first author was supported by UK EPSRC grantEP/K017896/1, uComp (http://www.ucomp.eu/).ReferencesJ.
