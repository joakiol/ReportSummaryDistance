Using Word-Pair Identifier to Improve Chinese Input SystemJia-Lin TsaiTung Nan Institute of Technology, Department of Information ManagementTaipei 222, Taiwan, R.O.C.tsaijl@mail.tnit.edu.twAbstractThis paper presents a word-pair (WP)identifier that can be used to resolvehomonym/segmentation ambiguitiesand perform syllable-to-word (STW)conversion effectively for improvingChinese input systems.
The experi-ment results show the following: (1)the WP identifier is able to achieve to-nal (syllables with four tones) andtoneless (syllables without four tones)STW accuracies of 98.5% and 90.7%,respectively, among the identifiedword-pairs; (2) while applying the WPidentifier, together with the Microsoftinput method editor 2003 and an opti-mized bigram model, the tonal andtoneless STW improvements of thetwo input systems are 27.5%/18.9%and 22.1%/18.8%, respectively.1 IntroductionMore than 100 Chinese input methods have beendeveloped in the past (Becker 1985, Huang 1985,Gu et al 1991, Chung 1993, Kuo 1995, Fu et al1996, Lee et al 1997, Hsu et al 1999, Chen etal.
2000, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al 2002,Lee 2003).
Their underlying approaches can beclassified into four types: (1) Optical characterrecognition (OCR) based (Chung 1993), (2) On-line handwriting based (Lee et al 1997), (3)Speech based (Fu et al 1996, Chen et al 2000),and (4) Keyboard based consists of phoneticand pinyin based (Chang et al 1991, Hsu et al1993, Hsu 1994, Hsu et al 1999, Kuo 1995, Luaand Gan 1992); arbitrary codes based [Fan et al1988]; and structure scheme based (Huang1985).Currently, the most popular method for Chi-nese input is phonetic and pinyin based, becauseChinese people are taught to write the corre-sponding phonetic and pinyin syllables of eachChinese character and word in primary school.In Chinese, each Chinese character correspondsto at least one syllable; and each Chinese wordcan be a mono-syllabic word, such as ??
(mouse)?, a bi-syllabic word, such as ???
(kangaroo)?, or a multi-syllabic word, such as????
(Mickey mouse).?
Although there aremore than 13,000 distinct Chinese characters (ofwhich 5,400 are commonly used), there are onlyabout 1,300 distinct syllables.
As per (Qiao et al1984), each Chinese syllable can be mappedfrom 3 to over 100 Chinese characters, with theaverage number of characters per syllable being17.
According to our computation, the minimum,maximum and average numbers f Chinese wordsper syllable-word in MOE-MANDARIN dic-tionary ?????????
(one of most com-monly-used Chinese dictionaries published bythe Ministry of Education in Taiwan, its onlinedictionary is at (MOE)) are 1, 22 and 1.5, re-spectively.
Since the size of problem space forsyllable-to-word conversion is much less thanthat of syllable-to-character conversion, themost existing Chinese input systems (Hsu 1994,Hsu et al 1999, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al2002, MSIME) are addressed on syllable-to-word conversion, not syllable-to-character con-version.
To the research field of Chinese speechrecognition, the STW conversion is the maintask of Chinese language processing in typicalChinese speech recognition systems (Fu et al1996, Lee et al 1993, Chien et al 1993, Su et al1992).Conventionally, there are two approaches forsyllable-to-word (STW) conversion: (1) the lin-guistic approach based on syntax parsing, se-9mantic template matching and contextual infor-mation (Hsu 1994, Fu et al 1996, Hsu et al1999, Kuo 1995, Tsai and Hsu 2002); and (2)the statistical approach based on the n-grammodels where n is usually 2 or 3 (Lin and Tsai1987, Gu et al 1991, Fu et al 1996, Ho et al1997, Sproat 1990, Gao et al 2002, Lee 2003).Although the linguistic approach requires con-siderable effort in designing effective syntaxrules, semantic templates or contextual informa-tion, it is more user-friendly than the statisticalapproach on understanding why such a systemmakes a mistake (Hsu 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002).On the other hand, the statistical language model(SLM) used in the statistical approach requiresless effort and has been widely adopted in com-mercial Chinese input systems.According to previous studies (Chung 1993,Fong and Chung 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gaoet al 2002, Lee 2003), homophone selection andsyllable-word segmentation are two criticalproblems to the STW conversion in Chinese.Incorrect homophone selection and failed sylla-ble-word segmentation will directly influencethe STW conversion rate.
For example, considerthe syllable sequence ?yi1 du4 ji4 yu2 zhong1guo2 de5 niang4 jiu3 ji4 shu4?
of the sentence???(once)??(covet)??(China)?(of)??(making-wine)??
(technique).?
As per theMOE-MANDARIN dictionary, the two possiblesyllable-word segmentations (in pinyin) are:(F)?yi1/du4ji4/yu2/zhong1guo2/de5/niang4jiu3/ji4shu4?
; and(B)?yi1/du4/ji4yu2/zhong1guo2/de5/niang4jiu3/ji4shu4.?
(We use the forward (F) and the backward (B)longest syllable-word first strategies (Chen et al1986, Tsai and Hsu 2002), and ?/?
to indicate asyllable-word boundary).Among the above syllable-word segmentations,there is an ambiguous syllable-word section:/du4ji4/yu2/ (/{??}/{?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?
,?
}/); and /du4/ji4yu2/ (/{?,?,?,?,?,?,?}/{??
,??
}/), respectively.
For the am-biguous syllable-word section, the set of word-pairs comprised of two multi-syllabic Chinesewords (including bi-syllabic words in the fol-lowing) and their corresponding word-pair fre-quencies found in the UDN2001 corpus are: {??-??
(1), ??-??
(1), ??-??
(4), ??-??
(1), ??-??
(1), ??-??
(26), ??-??(19)}.
The UDN2001 corpus (Tsai and Hsu2002) is a collection of 4,539,624 Chinese sen-tences extracted from whole 2001 articles on theUnited Daily News Website (UDN) in Taiwan.For this case, if the word-pair ???(China)-??(technique)?
with the maximum frequency 26is used to be the key word-pair, the set of co-occurrence word-pairs with the key word-pairfound in the UDN2001 will be {??-?
?, ??-?
?, ??-?
?, ??-?
?, ??-??
}.Then, by the key word-pair ???-???
and itsco-occurrence word-pair set {??-?
?, ??-?
?, ??-?
?, ??-?
?, ??-??
}, thementioned ambiguous syllable-word section(/du4ji4/yu2/ and /du4/ji4yu2/) and the homo-phone selection of syllable-word /ji4 shu4/ (/{??(technique),??
(count)}/) of this case can beresolved, simultaneously.
Thus, the Chinesewords ???
(once)?, ???
(covet)?, ???(China)?
and ???(technique)?
in the syllablesequence ?yi1 du4 ji4 yu2 zhong1 guo2 de5niang4 jiu3 ji4 shu4?
can then be correctly iden-tified.
If we use the Microsoft Input MethodEditor 2003 for Traditional Chinese (MSIME) totranslate the syllables, it will be converted into???(once)?
(continue)?(to)??(China)?(of)??(making-wine)??(technique).?
As per(Gao et al 2002), MSIME is a trigam-like Chi-nese input system.
The two error convertedwords ??(continue)?
and ??(to)?
are widelyrecognized that unseen event (??-??)
andover-weighting (?-??)
the two major prob-lems of SLM systems (Fu et al 1996, Gao et al2002).The objective of this study is to illustrate theeffectiveness of word-pairs for resolving theSTW conversion for improving the Chinese in-put systems.
We also conduct STW experimentsto show the tonal and toneless STW accuraciesof a commercial input product and a bigrammodel can be improved by our word-pair identi-fier without a tuning process.
Here, the ?tonal?is to indicate the syllables input with four tones,such as ?niang4(?)
jiu3(?)
ji4(?)
shu4(?
)?and the ?toneless?
is to indicate the syllablesinput without four tones, such as ?niang(?
)jiu(?)
ji(?)
shu(?).
?10The remainder of this paper is arranged asfollows.
In Section 2, we present a method forauto-generating word-pair (AUTO-WP) data-base from Chinese sentences.
Then, we developa word-pair identifier with the WP database toeffectively resolve homonym and segmentationambiguities of STW conversion on the WP-related portion in Chinese syllables.
In Section 3,we present our STW experiment results.
Finally,in Section 4, we give our conclusions and sug-gest some future research directions.2 Development of Word-Pair IdentifierThe system dictionary of our word-pair identi-fier is comprised of 155,746 Chinese wordstaken from the MOE-MANDARIN dictionary(MOE) and 29,408 unknown words auto-foundin UDN2001 corpus by a Chinese word auto-confirmation (CWAC) system (Tsai et al 2003).The system dictionary provides the knowledgeof words and their corresponding pinyin sylla-ble-words.
The pinyin syllable-words weretranslated by phoneme-to-pinyin mappings, suchas ?????-to-?ji4.
?2.1 Generating the Word-Pair DatabaseThe steps of our AUTO-WP to auto-discoveryword-pairs from a given Chinese sentence are asbelow:Step 1.
Segmentation: Generate the wordsegmentation for a given Chinese sen-tence by backward maximum matching(BMM) techniques (Chen et al 1986)with the system dictionary.
Take the Chi-nese sentence ????????
(bringthe military component parts here)?
as anexample.
Its BMM  word-segmentation is??(get)/??(military)/??
(componentparts)/ ?
?
(bring)?
and its forwardmaximum matching (FMM) word-segmentation is ???
(a general)/?(use)/??
(component parts)/??
(bring).
?According to our previous work (Tsai etal.
2004), the word segmentation preci-sion of BMM is about 1% greater thanthat of FMM.Step 2.
Initial WP set: Extract all the combi-nations of word-pairs from the wordsegmentations of Step 1 to be the initialWP set.
For the above case, there are sixcombinations of word-pairs extracted:{??/??
?, ??/??
?, ??/??
?, ???/??
?, ???/??
?, ???/???
}.Step 3.
Final WP set: Select out the word-pairs comprised of two multi-syllabicChinese words to be the finial WP set.For the final WP set, if the word-pair isnot found in the WP database, insert itinto the WP database and set its fre-quency to 1; otherwise, increase its fre-quency by 1.
In the above case, the finalWP set includes three word-pairs: {???/??
?, ???/??
?, ???/???
}.By applying our AUTO-WP to the UDN2001corpus (the training corpus), totally 25,439,679word-pairs were generated.
From the generatedWP database, the frequencies of word-pairs ???/??
?, ???/???
and ???/???
are 1,1 and 2, respectively.
The frequency of a word-pair is the number of sentences that contain theword-pair with the same word-pair order in thetraining corpus.2.2 Word-Pair IdentifierThe algorithm of our WP identifier for a givenChinese syllables is as follows:Step 1.
Input tonal or toneless syllables.Step 2.
Generate all possible word-pairs com-prised of two multi-syllabic Chinesewords for the input syllables to be the in-put of Step 3.Step 3.
Select out the word-pairs that match aword-pair in the WP database to be theinitial WP set, firstly.
Then, from the ini-tial WP set, select the word-pair withmaximum frequency as the key word-pair.Finally, find the co-occurrence word-pairs with the key word-pair in the train-ing corpus to be the final WP set.
If thereare two or more word-pairs with the samemaximum frequency, one of them is ran-domly selected as the key word-pair.Step 4.
Arrange all word-pairs of the final WPset into a WP-sentence.
If no word-pairscan be identified in the input syllables, aNULL WP-sentence is produced.11Table 1 is a step by step example to showthe details of applying our WP identifier on theChinese syllables ?yi1 ge5 wen2 ming2 de5shuai1 wei2 guo4 cheng2( ?

[a] ?
?[civilization]?[of]??[decay]??[process]).
?For this case, we have a WP-sentence ?????

.?
As we have men-tioned in Section 1, we found this WP-sentencecan also be used to correct the MSIME con-verted errors in its output ???[a]??[famous]?[of]??[decay]??[process].

?3 The STW ExperimentsTo evaluate the STW performance of our WPidentifier, we define the STW accuracy, identi-fied character ratio (ICR) and STW improve-ment, by the following equations:STW accuracy = # of correct characters / # oftotal characters.
(1)Identified character ratio (ICR) = # of charactersof identified WP / # of total characters in testingsentences.
(2)STW improvement (i.e.
STW error reductionrate) = (accuracy of STW system with WP ?accuracy of STW system)) / (1 ?
accuracy ofSTW system).
(3)3.1 Generation of the Word-Pair DatabaseTo conduct the STW experiments, firstly, usethe inverse translator of phoneme-to-character(PTC) provided in GOING system to converttesting sentences into their corresponding sylla-bles.
Then, all the error PTC translations ofGOING were corrected by post human-editing.Then, apply our WP identifier to convert thesetesting syllables back to their WP-sentences.Finally, calculate its STW accuracy and identi-fied character ratio by Equations (1) and (2).Note that all test sentences are composed of astring of Chinese characters in this study.The training/testing corpus, closed/open testsets and the testing WP database used in theSTW experiments are described as below:(1) Training corpus: We used the UDN2001corpus mentioned in Section 1 as our trainingcorpus.
All knowledge of word frequencies,word-pairs, word-pair frequencies was auto-generated and computed by this corpus.
(2) Testing corpus: The UDN2002 corpus wasselected as our testing corpus.
It is a collec-tion of 3,321,504 Chinese sentences that wereextracted from whole 2002 articles on theUnited Daily News Website (UDN).
(3) Closed test set: 10,000 sentences were ran-domly selected from the UDN2001 corpus asthe closed test set.
The {minimum, maximum,and mean} of characters per sentence for theclosed test set were {4, 37, and 12}.
(4) Open test set: 10,000 sentences were ran-domly selected from the UDN2002 corpus asthe open test set.
At this point, we checkedthat the selected open test sentences were notin the closed test set as well.
The {minimum,maximum, and mean} of characters per sen-tence for the open test set were {4, 43, and13.7}.
(5) Testing WP database: By applying ourAUTO-WP on the UDN2001 corpus, we cre-ated 25,439,679 word-pairs as the testing WPdatabase.We conducted the STW experiment in a pro-gressive manner.
The results and analysis of theexperiment are described in Sub-sections 3.2and 3.3.123.2 STW Experiment of the WP IdentifierThe purpose of this experiment is to demon-strate the tonal and toneless STW accuraciesamong the identified word-pairs by using theWP identifier with the testing WP database.From Table 2, the average tonal and tonelessSTW accuracies of the WP identifier for theclosed and open test sets are 98.5% and 90.7%,respectively.
Between the closed and the opentest sets, the differences of the tonal and tone-less STW accuracies of the WP identifier are0.5% and 1.4%, respectively.
These resultsstrongly support that the WP identifier can beused to effectively perform Chinese STW con-version on the WP-related portion.Table 2.

The BiGram STW sys-tem is a bigram-based model developing bySRILM (Stolcke 2002) with Good-Turing back-off smoothing (Manning and Schuetze, 1999),as well as forward and backward longest sylla-ble-word first strategies (Chen et al 1986, Tsaiet al 2004).
The training corpus and systemdictionary of the BiGram system are same withthat of the WP identifier.
All the bigram prob-abilities were calculated by the UDN2001 cor-pus.Table 3a compares the results of MSIMEand MSIME with the WP identifier on theclosed and open test sentences.
Table 3b com-pares the results of BiGram and BiGram withthe WP identifier on the closed and open testsentences.
In this experiment, the STW outputof the MSIME with the WP identifier, or theBiGram with the WP identifier, was collectedby directly replacing the identified word-pairs(WP-sentences) from the corresponding STWoutput of MSIME or BiGram.Table 3a.

(Note that we also developed a TriGramSTW system with the same source and tech-niques of BiGram.
However, the differencesbetween the tonal and toneless STW accuraciesof BiGram and TriGram are only about 0.2%)To sum up the results of this experiment, weconclude that the WP identifier can achieve abetter STW accuracy than that of the MSIMEand BiGram systems on the WP-related portion.The results of Tables 3a and 3b indicate that theWP identifier can effectively improve the tonaland toneless STW accuracies of MSIME andBiGram without tuning processing.
Appendix Apresents two cases of STW results that wereobtained from the experiment.3.4 Error Analysis of the STW ConversionWe examine the Top 300 cases in the tonal andtoneless STW conversion errors, respectively,from the open testing results of BiGram with theWP identifier.
As per our analysis, the problemsof STW conversion errors can be classified intothree major types:(1) Unknown word problem: For any ChineseNLP system, unknown word extraction isone of the most difficult problems and acritical issue (Tsai et al 2003).
When an er-ror is caused only by the lack of words inthe system dictionary, we call it unknown13word problem.
(2) Inadequate syllable segmentation problem:When an error is caused by syllable-wordoverlapping (or say ambiguous syllable-word segmentation), instead of an unknownword problem, we call it inadequate sylla-ble segmentation.
(3) Homophones problem: These are the re-maining STW conversion errors.Table 4.
The coverage of three problems caused thetonal and toneless STW conversion errorsProblems                  Coverage (%)Tonal  TonelessUnknown Word       12%   11%Inadequate Syllable 36%  51%SegmentationHomophone  53%  39%a STW accuracies of the words identified by the BiGramwith the WP identifierTable 4 is the coverage of the three problems.From Table 4, we have two observations:(1) The coverage of unknown word problemfor tonal and toneless STW systems issimilar.
Since the unknown word problemis not specifically a STW problem, it can beeasily taken care of through manual editingor semi-automatic learning during input.
Inpractice, therefore, the tonal and tonelessSTW accuracies could be raised to 98% and91%, respectively.
Although some of un-known words have been incorporated in thesystem dictionary by a CWCA system (Tsaiet al 2004), they could still face the prob-lems: inadequate syllable segmentation andfailed homophone disambiguation.
(2) The major problem caused error conver-sions in tonal and toneless STW systemsis different.
To improve tonal STW sys-tems, the major targets should be the casesof failed homophone selection (53% cover-age).
For toneless STW systems, on theother hand, the cases of inadequate syllablesegmentation (51% coverage) should be thefocus for improvement.To sum up the above two observations, the bot-tlenecks of the STW conversion lie in the sec-ond and third problems.
To resolve these issues,we believe one simple and effective approach isto extend the size of WP database, because ourexperiment results show that the WP identifiercan achieve better tonal and toneless STW accu-racies than those of MSIME and BiGram on theWP-related portion.4 Conclusion and Future DirectionsIn this paper, we have applied a WP identifierto support the Chinese language processing onthe STW conversion and obtained a high STWaccuracy on the identified word-pairs.
All of theWP data can be generated fully automaticallyby applying the AUTO-WP on the system anduser corpus.
We are encouraged by the fact thatWP knowledge can achieve tonal and tonelessSTW accuracies of 98.5% and 90.7%, respec-tively, for the WP-related portion on the testingsyllables.
The WP identifier can be easily inte-grated into existing Chinese input systems byidentifying word-pairs in a post-processing step.Our experimental results show that, by applyingthe WP identifier together with MSIME (a tri-gram-like model) and BiGram (an optimizedbigram model), the tonal and toneless STW im-provements of the two Chinese input systemsare 27.5%/22.1% and 18.9%/18.8%, respec-tively.
For adaptation STW approach, we havetried to apply the AUTO-WP to extract theword-pairs from the 10,000 open testing sen-tences into the testing WP database, the tonaland toneless STW accuracies of the MSIMEwith the adaptation WP identifier and the Bi-Gram with the adaptation WP identifier willbecome 97.0%/97.2% and 91.1%/90.0%, re-spectively.Currently, our approach is quite basic whenmore than one WP occurs in the same sentence.Although there is room for improvement, webelieve it would not produce a noticeable effectas far as the STW accuracy is concerned.
How-ever, this issue will become important as wewant to apply the WP knowledge to speech rec-ognition.
According to our computations, thecollection of testing WP knowledge can coverapproximately 50% and 40% of the charactersin the UDN2001 and UDN2002 corpus, respec-tively.We will continue to expand our collection ofWP knowledge to cover more characters in theUDN2001 and UDN2002 corpus with Webcorpus (search engine results) for improving ourSTW system.
In other directions, we will try toimprove our WP-based STW conversion withother statistical language models, such as HMM,14and extend it to other areas of NLP, especiallyword segmentation and speech recognition.AcknowledgementWe thank the Mandarin Promotion Councilof the Ministry of Education in Taiwan for pro-viding us the MOE-MANDARIN dictionary.ReferencesBecker, J.D.
