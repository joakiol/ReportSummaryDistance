These researchers are eager to searchbiomedical correlations such as protein-protein orgene-disease associations.
The use of natural lan-guage processing technology is expected to re-duce their burden, and various attempts of infor-mation extraction using NLP has been being made(Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Hao et al, 2005;Chun et al, 2006).
However, the framework oftraditional information retrieval (IR) has difficultywith the accurate retrieval of such relational con-cepts.
This is because relational concepts areessentially determined by semantic relations ofwords, and keyword-based IR techniques are in-sufficient to describe such relations precisely.This paper proposes a practical HPSG parserfor English, Enju, an intelligent search engine forthe accurate retrieval of relational concepts from?Current Affiliation:?School of Informatics, University of Manchester?Knowledge Research Center, Fujitsu Laboratories LTD.?Faculty of Informatics, Kogakuin University?Information Technology Center, University of TokyoF-ScoreGENIA treebank Penn TreebankHPSG-PTB 85.10% 87.16%HPSG-GENIA 86.87% 86.81%Table 1: Performance for Penn Treebank and theGENIA corpusMEDLINE, MEDIE, and a GUI-based efficientMEDLINE search tool, Info-PubMed.2 Enju: An English HPSG ParserWe developed an English HPSG parser, Enju 1(Miyao and Tsujii, 2005; Hara et al, 2005; Ni-nomiya et al, 2005).
Table 1 shows the perfor-mance.
The F-score in the table was accuracyof the predicate-argument relations output by theparser.
A predicate-argument relation is definedas a tuple ?
?,wh, a, wa?, where ?
is the predi-cate type (e.g., adjective, intransitive verb), whis the head word of the predicate, a is the argu-ment label (MOD, ARG1, ..., ARG4), and wa isthe head word of the argument.
Precision/recallis the ratio of tuples correctly identified by theparser.
The lexicon of the grammar was extractedfrom Sections 02-21 of Penn Treebank (39,832sentences).
In the table, ?HPSG-PTB?
means thatthe statistical model was trained on Penn Tree-bank.
?HPSG-GENIA?
means that the statisticalmodel was trained on both Penn Treebank and GE-NIA treebank as described in (Hara et al, 2005).The GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al, 2005) consistsof 500 abstracts (4,446 sentences) extracted fromMEDLINE.Figure 1 shows a part of the parse tree and fea-1http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/enju/17Figure 1: Snapshot of Enjuture structure for the sentence ?NASA officialsvowed to land Discovery early Tuesday at oneof three locations after weather conditions forcedthem to scrub Monday?s scheduled return.
?3 MEDIE: a search engine forMEDLINEFigure 2 shows the top page of the MEDIE.
ME-DIE is an intelligent search engine for the accu-rate retrieval of relational concepts from MED-LINE 2 (Miyao et al, 2006).
Prior to retrieval, allsentences are annotated with predicate argumentstructures and ontological identifiers by applyingEnju and a term recognizer.3.1 Automatically Annotated CorpusFirst, we applied a POS analyzer and then Enju.The POS analyzer and HPSG parser are trainedby using the GENIA corpus (Tsuruoka et al,2005; Hara et al, 2005), which comprises around2,000 MEDLINE abstracts annotated with POSand Penn Treebank style syntactic parse trees(Tateisi et al, 2005).
The HPSG parser generatesparse trees in a stand-off format that can be con-verted to XML by combining it with the originaltext.We also annotated technical terms of genes anddiseases in our developed corpus.
Technical termsare annotated simply by exact matching of dictio-2http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/medie/nary entries and the terms separated by space, tab,period, comma, hat, colon, semi-colon, brackets,square brackets and slash in MEDLINE.The entire dictionary was generated by apply-ing the automatic generation method of name vari-ations (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2004) to the GENAdictionary for the gene names (Koike and Takagi,2004) and the UMLS (Unified Medical LanguageSystem) meta-thesaurus for the disease names(Lindberg et al, 1993).
It was generated by ap-plying the name-variation generation method, andwe obtained 4,467,855 entries of a gene and dis-ease dictionary.3.2 Functions of MEDIEMEDIE provides three types of search, seman-tic search, keyword search, GCL search.
GCLsearch provides us the most fundamental and pow-erful functions in which users can specify theboolean relations, linear order relation and struc-tural relations with variables.
Trained users canenjoy all functions in MEDIE by the GCL search,but it is not easy for general users to write ap-propriate queries for the parsed corpus.
The se-mantic search enables us to specify an event verbwith its subject and object easily.
MEDIE auto-matically generates the GCL query from the se-mantic query, and runs the GCL search.
Figure 3shows the output of semantic search for the query?What disease does dystrophin cause??.
This ex-ample will give us the most intuitive understand-ings of the proximal and structural retrieval with arichly annotated parsed corpus.
MEDIE retrievessentences which include event verbs of ?cause?and noun ?dystrophin?
such that ?dystrophin?
is thesubject of the event verbs.
The event verb and itssubject and object are highlighted with designatedcolors.
As seen in the figure, small sentences inrelative clauses, passive forms or coordination areretrieved.
As the objects of the event verbs arehighlighted, we can easily see what disease dys-trophin caused.
As the target corpus is alreadyannotated with diseases entities, MEDIE can ef-ficiently retrieve the disease expressions.4 Info-PubMed: a GUI-basedMEDLINE search toolInfo-PubMed is a MEDLINE search tool withGUI, helping users to find information aboutbiomedical entities such as genes, proteins, and18Figure 2: Snapshot of MEDIE: top page?Figure 3: Snapshot of MEDIE: ?What disease doesdystrophin cause?
?the interactions between them 3.Info-PubMed provides information from MED-LINE on protein-protein interactions.
Given thename of a gene or protein, it shows a list of thenames of other genes/proteins which co-occur insentences from MEDLINE, along with the fre-quency of co-occurrence.Co-occurrence of two proteins/genes in thesame sentence does not always imply that they in-teract.
For more accurate extraction of sentencesthat indicate interactions, it is necessary to iden-tify relations between the two substances.
Weadopted PASs derived by Enju and constructed ex-traction patterns on specific verbs and their argu-ments based on the derived PASs (Yakusiji, 2006).Figure 4: Snapshot of Info-PubMed (1)Figure 5: Snapshot of Info-PubMed (2)Figure 6: Snapshot of Info-PubMed (3)4.1 Functions of Info-PubMedIn the ?Gene Searcher?
window, enter the nameof a gene or protein that you are interested in.For example, if you are interested in Raf1, type?raf1?
in the ?Gene Searcher?
(Figure 4).
Youwill see a list of genes whose description in ourdictionary contains ?raf1?
(Figure 5).
Then, drag3http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/info-pubmed/19one of the GeneBoxes from the ?Gene Searcher?to the ?Interaction Viewer.?
You will see a listof genes/proteins which co-occur in the samesentences, along with co-occurrence frequency.The GeneBox in the leftmost column is the oneyou have moved to ?Interaction Viewer.?
TheGeneBoxes in the second column correspond togene/proteins which co-occur in the same sen-tences, followed by the boxes in the third column,InteractionBoxes.Drag an InteractionBox to ?ContentViewer?
tosee the content of the box (Figure 6).
An In-teractionBox is a set of SentenceBoxes.
A Sen-tenceBox corresponds to a sentence in MEDLINEin which the two gene/proteins co-occur.
A Sen-tenceBox indicates whether the co-occurrence inthe sentence is direct evidence of interaction ornot.
If it is judged as direct evidence of interac-tion, it is indicated as Interaction.
Otherwise, it isindicated as Co-occurrence.5 ConclusionWe presented an English HPSG parser, Enju, asearch engine for relational concepts from MED-LINE, MEDIE, and a GUI-based MEDLINEsearch tool, Info-PubMed.MEDIE and Info-PubMed demonstrate how theresults of deep parsing can be used for intelligenttext mining and semantic information retrieval inthe biomedical domain.6 AcknowledgmentThis work was partially supported by Grant-in-Aidfor Scientific Research on Priority Areas ?Sys-tems Genomics?
