Proceedings of TextGraphs-9: the workshop on Graph-based Methods for Natural Language Processing, pages 34?38,October 29, 2014, Doha, Qatar.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsConstructing Coherent Event Hierarchies from News StoriesGoran Glava?s and Jan?SnajderUniversity of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and ComputingText Analysis and Knowledge Engineering LabUnska 3, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia{goran.glavas,jan.snajder}@fer.hrAbstractNews describe real-world events of vary-ing granularity, and recognition of inter-nal structure of events is important for au-tomated reasoning over events.
We pro-pose an approach for constructing coherentevent hierarchies from news by enforcingdocument-level coherence over pairwisedecisions of spatiotemporal containment.Evaluation on a news corpus annotatedwith event hierarchies shows that enforc-ing global spatiotemporal coreference ofevents leads to significant improvements(7.6% F1-score) in the accuracy of pair-wise decisions.1 IntroductionAlthough real-world events have exact spatiotempo-ral extent, event mentions in text are often spatiallyand temporally vague.
Moreover, event mentionstypically denote real-world events of varying gran-ularity (e.g., summit vs. conversation).
If not ad-dressed, these issues hinder event-based inference.Research efforts in event extraction have focusedon either extracting temporal relations (Pustejovskyet al., 2003a; UzZaman et al., 2013) or recognizingspatial relations (Mani et al., 2010; Roberts et al.,2013) between events.
Apart from being difficultto recognize, temporal and spatial containment ?when considered in isolation ?
do not suffice toinfer that one event is a part of another.
Temporally,an event may happen during another event and notbe a part of it, as in (1).
(1) In the midst of the World War II, the Ar-gentinian government reduced rents.In this case, ?the reduction of rents in Argentina?happened during ?the World War II,?
but was notpart of it.
Conversely, an event may occur withinthe spatial extent of another event and not be a partof it, as shown by (2).
(2) The fire destroyed 60% of London afteralmost 30,000 people died from plague.The spatial extent of ?destruction by fire?
is con-tained within the extent of ?people dying fromplague,?
but the former is not a part of the latter.An event e1is a part of event e2if and only if e1isspatially and temporally contained within e2.In previous research (Chambers and Jurafsky,2008; Jans et al., 2012), news narratives were mod-eled as chains of events involving the same par-ticipants.
Such script-like representations, how-ever, do not account for the non-linear (hierarchi-cal) nature of events.
In contrast, in this work wemodel the structure of events in a narrative viarelations of spatiotemporal containment (STC) be-tween event mentions, effectively inducing a hierar-chy of events.
We construct directed acyclic graphsof event mentions, in which edges denote STC re-lations between events.
We call this structure anevent hierarchy directed acyclic graph (EHDAG).We propose a two-step approach for constructingEHDAGs from news.
We first detect the STC rela-tions between pairs of event mentions in a super-vised fashion, building on our previous approach(Glava?s et al., 2014).
We then enforce structuralcoherence over local predictions, framing the taskas a constrained optimization problem, which wesolve using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).2 Related ResearchIntroduction of the TimeML standard (Pustejovskyet al., 2003a) and the TimeBank corpus (Puste-jovsky et al., 2003b) triggered a surge of researchon extraction of temporal relations, much of whichwithin TempEval campaigns (Verhagen et al., 2010;UzZaman et al., 2013).
More recently, followingthe emergence of the SpatialML standard (Mani etal., 2010), Roberts et al.
(2013) have proposed anannotation scheme and the supervised model forextracting spatial relations between events.The abovementioned approaches, however, do34(document)encountersummit warSpeakingagreedbloodshedsaidsparredtalksFigure 1: An example of an EHDAG for a narrativenot account for global narrative coherence.
Cham-bers and Jurafsky (2008) consider narratives to bechains of temporally ordered events linked by acommon protagonist.
Limiting a narrative to a se-quence of protagonist-sharing events can often beoverly restrictive.
E.g., an ?encounter betweenMerkel and Holland?
may belong to the same?summit?
narrative as a ?meeting between Obamaand Putin,?
although they share no protagonists.Several approaches enforce coherence of tempo-ral relations at a document level.
Bramsen et al.
(2006) represent the temporal structure of a doc-ument as a DAG in which vertices denote textualsegments and edges temporal precedence.
Simi-larly, Do et al.
(2012) enforce coherence using ILPfor joint inference on decisions from local event?event and event?time interval decisions.Complementary to Chambers and Jurafsky(2008), who use a linear temporal structure, withEHDAGs we model the hierarchical structure ofevents with diverse participants.
Similarly to Bram-sen et al.
(2006), we use an ILP formulation ofglobal coherence over local decisions, but considerSTC relations between events rather than temporalrelations between textual segments.3 Constructing Coherent HierarchiesAs an example, consider the following news snip-pet, with the corresponding EHDAG shown inFig.
1:(3) Obama sparred with Vladimir Putin overhow to end the war in Syria on Monday dur-ing an icy encounter at a G8 summit.
Speak-ing after talks with Obama, Putin said theyagreed the bloodshed must end.
.
.We first use a supervised classifier to determine theSTC relations between all pairs of events in a doc-ument.
In the second step, we induce a spatiotem-porally coherent EHDAG by enforcing coherenceconstraints on the local classification decisions.3.1 Spatiotemporal Containment ClassifierWe first describe the classifier used for predictinglocal STC relations.
The classifier is given a pair ofevent mentions, (e1, e2), where mention e1occursin text before mention e2.
The classifier predictsone of the following relations: (1) e1SUBSUPERe2, denoting that the e1(subevent) is spatiotem-porally contained by event e2(superevent); (2)e1SUPERSUB e2, denoting that e1(superevent)spatiotemporally contains e2(subevent); and (3)NOREL, denoting that neither of the two eventsspatiotemporally contains the other.
We use thefollowing rich set of features for the STC relationclassifier.Event-based features: Word, lemma, stem,POS-tag, and TimeML type of both event mentions.Additionally, we compare the event argumentsof three semantic types: AGENT, TARGET, andLOCATION, which we extract automatically fromraw text using the rule-based model by Glava?s and?Snajder (2013).Bag-of-words features: All lemmas in betweenthe two event mentions, with the special statusbeing assigned to temporal signals (e.g., before)and spatial signals (e.g., inside).Positional features: The distance between eventmentions in the document, both in the number ofsentences and the number of tokens.
Additionally,we use a feature indicating if the two mentions areadjacent (no mentions occur in between).Syntactic features: All dependency relationson the path between events in the dependencytree and features that indicate whether one ofthe features syntactically governs the other.
Wecompute the syntactic features only for pairs ofevent mentions from the same sentence, using theStanford dependency parser (De Marneffe et al.,2006).Knowledge-based features: Computed usingWordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), VerbOcean (Chklovskiand Pantel, 2004), and CatVar (Habash and Dorr,2003).
We use a feature indicating whether oneevent mention or any of its derivatives (obtainedfrom CatVar) is a WordNet hypernym of (for nomi-nalized mentions) or entailed from (for verb men-tions) the other mention (or any of its deriva-tives).
We use an additional feature to indicate theVerbOcean relation between the event mentions, ifsuch exists.
Unlike features from previous groups,35knowledge-based features have not been used oftenfor temporal relation classification.We employ a L2-regularized logistic regres-sion as our pairwise classification model, whichis motivated by the high-dimensional feature spacespanned by the lexical features Moreover, theglobal coherence component of the model requiresprobability distributions for local decisions overrelation types.
We use the LibLinear (Fan et al.,2008) implementation of logistic regression.3.2 Global CoherenceThe hierarchy of events induced from the indepen-dent pairwise STC decisions may be globally in-coherent.
We therefore need to optimize the set ofpairwise STC classifications with respect to the setof constraints that enforce global coherence.
Weperform exact inference using Integer Linear Pro-gramming (ILP), an approach that has been provenuseful in many NLP applications (Punyakanok etal., 2004; Roth and Yih, 2007; Clarke and Lapata,2008).
We use the lp solve1solver to optimize theobjective function with respect to the constraints.Objective function.
Let M = {e1, e2, .
.
.
, en}be the set of all event mentions in the news storyand P be the set of all considered pairs of eventmentions, P = {(ei, ej) | ei, ej?
M, i < j}.Let R = {SUPERSUB, SUBSUPER, NOREL} bethe set of spatiotemporal relation types and letC(ei, ej, r) be the probability, produced by thepairwise classifier, of relation r holding betweenevent mentions eiand ej.
We maximize the sumof local probabilities assigned to all pairs of events(summed over all relation types):?
(ei,ej)?P?r?RC(ei, ej, r) ?
xei,ej,r(1)where xei,ej,ris a binary indicator variable thattakes the value 1 iff the relation of type r is pre-dicted to hold between events eiand ej.Spatiotemporal constraints.
The objectivefunction is a subject to two basic constraints: (i)the constraint that declares xei,ej,rto be binaryindicator variables (eq.
2) and (ii) the exclusivityconstraint, which allows only one relation to holdbetween two events (eq.
3).xei,ej,r?

P (3)1http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/Following the work of Bramsen et al.
(2006) andDo et al.
(2012), we also incorporate the transitiv-ity constraints into the model (transitivity is notenforced for NOREL):xei,ej,r+ xej,ek,r?
1 ?
xei,ek,r, (4)?r ?
R, {(ei, ej), (ej, ek), (ei, ek)} ?
PThe transitivity constraint states that, if the samerelation r holds for pairs of events (ei, ej) and(ej, ek), then r must also hold for the pair (ei, ek).Coreference constraints.
The constraints pre-sented so far did not consider the coreference ofevent mentions.
However, a truly coherent eventstructure must account for the different mentionsof the same event.
More precisely, two differentconstraints have to be enforced: (i) a pair of coref-erent event mentions can only be assigned relationof the NOREL type because coreferent event men-tions cannot be part of each other (eq.
5) and (ii)all coreferent mentions of one event must be inthe same relation with all coreferent mentions ofthe other event (eqs.
6?9).
Let coref (ei, ej) be apredicate that holds iff mentions e1and e2corefer.The coreference constraints are as follows:xei,ej,r= 1, (5)?
(ei, ej) ?
P, r = NOREL, coref (ei, ej)xei,ek,r?

The in-verse of SUPERSUB is SUBSUPER (and vice versa),whereas NOREL is an inverse to itself.4 EvaluationWe evaluate several models on the publicly avail-able HIEVE corpus (Glava?s et al., 2014), consistingof 100 news stories manually annotated with eventhierarchies.36SUPERSUB SUBSUPER Micro-averagedModel P R F1P R F1P R F1MEMORIZE baseline 60.3 30.2 40.2 66.8 36.7 47.4 63.8 33.5 43.9PAIRWISE-NOKB 58.4 47.2 52.2 72.8 56.2 63.4 65.5 51.8 57.8PAIRWISE-FULL 69.8 51.2 59.1 70.6 54.1 61.3 70.2 52.6 60.1COHERENT 79.6 60.6 68.6 73.0 52.0 60.8 76.6 56.5 65.0COREF-AUTO 79.5 57.6 66.8 73.0 52.0 60.8 76.3 55.0 63.9COREF-GOLD 87.2 58.8 70.3 84.2 52.7 64.8 85.8 55.9 67.7Table 1: Model performance for recognizing spatiotemporal containment between events4.1 Experimental SetupWe leave out 20 news stories from the HIEVE cor-pus for testing and use the remaining 80 documentsfor training the pairwise STC classifiers.
Alto-gether, we evaluate the following five models.PAIRWISE model employs only the pairwise clas-sification and does not enforce coherence acrosslocal decisions.
We evaluate two classifiers: onewith knowledge-based features (PAIRWISE-FULL)and one without (PAIRWISE-NOKB).COHERENT model enforces document-level spa-tiotemporal coherence by solving the constrainedoptimization problem on top of pairwise classifica-tion decisions.
The model uses the constraints from(2)?
(4), but not the coreference-based constraints.COREF-GOLD model uses coreference con-straints (6)?
(9) in addition to constraints (2)?
(4).The model uses hand-annotated coreference rela-tions from the HIEVE corpus.COREF-AUTO model uses the same set of con-straints as the previous model, but relies on theevent coreference resolution model by Glava?s and?Snajder (2013) instead on gold annotations.As the baseline, we use the MEMORIZE model,which simply assigns to each pair of event men-tions in the test set their most frequent label in thetraining set.
The NOREL label is predicted for thepairs of lemmas not observed in the training set.A similar baseline has been proposed by Bethard(2008) for automated extraction of event mentions.To account for the transitivity of the STC re-lation, we evaluate the predictions of our modelsagainst the transitive closure of gold STC hierar-chies from the HIEVE corpus.4.2 ResultsTable 1 summarizes the results.
We show theperformance (precision, recall, and F1-score) forthe SUPERSUB and SUBSUPER relations alongwith the micro-averaged performance.
All mod-els significantly outperform the MEMORIZE base-line (with the exception of PAIRWISE-NOKB?sprecision), which has been shown competitive onthe event extraction task (Bethard, 2008).
Over-all, the PAIRWISE-FULL model outperforms thePAIRWISE-NOKB model, confirming the intuitionthat knowledge-based information is useful for de-tecting relations between events.
However, includ-ing KB features decreases the performance on theSUBSUPER class, which requires further analysis.Comparison of the PAIRWISE models and theCOHERENT model reveals that enforcing globalcoherence of local relations substantially improvesthe quality of the constructed hierarchies (4.9% F1-score; significant at p<0.01 using stratified shuf-fling (Yeh, 2000)).
With the introduction of addi-tional reference constraints (model COREF-GOLD),the quality improves by additional 2.7% F1-score(significant at p<0.05).
The fact that the modelCOREF-AUTO is outperformed by the COHERENTmodel, however, suggests that the automated coref-erence resolution model is not accurate enough tobenefit the global coherence constraints.5 ConclusionWe addressed the task of constructing coherentevent hierarchies based on recognition of spatiotem-poral containment between events from their men-tions in text.
The proposed approach constructsevent hierarchies by enforcing document-level co-herence over a set of local decisions on spatiotem-poral containment between events.
The qualityof the extracted event hierarchies is improved byenforcing global coherence, and can be improvedeven further using event coreference-based con-straints, provided accurate coreference resolution isavailable.
Our next step will be to incorporate pre-dictions from state-of-the-art temporal and spatialrelation extraction models, both as STC classifierfeatures and as additional optimization constraints.37ReferencesS.
