Currently,around 1 million words have been auto-matically tagged by developing a POS tagsetand a bigram POS tagger.1 IntroductionIn the information era, language technologiesand language processing have become a crucialissue to our social development which shouldbenefit from the information technology.However, there are many communities whoselanguages have been less studied and developedfor such need.Mongolian is one of the Altaic familylanguages.
It has a great, long history.Nonetheless, till now, there are no corpora forthe Mongolian language processing (Purev,2008).
Two years ago, a research project to builda tagged corpus for Mongolian began at theCenter for Research on Language Processing,National University of Mongolia.
In the last yearof this project, we developed a POS tagset and aPOS tagger, and tagged around 1 million wordsby using them.Currently, we have manually checked 260thousand automatically tagged words.
The rest ofthe tagged words have not checked yet becausechecking the tagged corpus needs more time andeffort without any automatic or semi-automatictool and method.The statistical method is used in our POStagger.
The rule based method requires theMongolian language description which isappropriate to NLP techniques such as POStagger.
But, the current description of Mongolianis quite difficult to model for the computerprocessing.
The tagger is based on a bigrammethod using HMM.
The tagger is trained onaround 250 thousand manually tagged words,and its accuracy is around 81 percent on taggingaround 1 million words.2 POS Tagset DesignWe designed a POS tagset for Mongolian corpusby studying the main materials in Mongolia(PANLocalization, 2007).
According to theagglutinative characteristics of Mongolian, thenumber of tags is not fixed, and it is possible tobe created a lot of combinations of tags.The POS tagset consists of two parts that are ahigh-level tagset and a low-level tagset.
Thehigh-level tagset is similar to English tags suchas noun, verb, adword etc.
It consists of 29 tags(see Table 1), while the low-level tagset consistsof 22 sub tags (see Table 2).
The annotation ofour tagset mainly follows the tagsets ofPennTreebank (Beatrice, 1990) and BNC(Geoffrey, 2000).No.

Low-Level Tagset for MongolianThe high-level tags are classified into noun, verband others as shown in Table 1.
In the nouncolumn, parts of speech in the noun phrase suchas adjective, number, abbreviation and so on areincluded.
In the verb column, parts of speech inthe verb phrase are included.
In the othercolumn, the parts of speech except those of thenoun and verb phrases are included.The low-level tagset is divided into twogeneral types: noun phrase and verb phrase.
Italso consists of sub tags for inflectional suffixessuch as cases, verb tenses etc.
These tags areused mainly in combination with high-level tags.Currently, around 198 combination tags havebeen created.
Most of them are for noun and verbinflections.
Tag marking length is 1 ?
5 letters.Below we show some tagged sentences (seeFigure 1).??PN????N????
?VPI horse rideI ride a horse??PN????????NB????
?VPI from horse fearI fear horses??PN??????????NBS?????
?VDI from my horse got offI got off my horseFigure 1.
Mongolian Tagged SentencesThree example sentences are shown in Figure 1.Mongolian sentence is placed in the first line,and the following lines, second, third and fourthare POS tags, English parts of speech translationand English translation, respectively.
A word??????
(horse) is used with differentmorphological forms such as nominative case inthe first sentence, ablative case in the secondsentence and ablative case followed bypossessive in the last sentence.
The nouninflected with nominative case is tagged N, thenoun inflected with ablative case is tagged NB,and the noun inflected with ablative case andpossessive is tagged NBS according to the twolevel tagset.3 Bigram-POS TaggerAlthough the statistical method needs a taggedcorpus which takes a lot of time and effort, it ismore reliable for languages whose linguisticdescriptions have difficulties in NLP and CLpurposes.
Thus, we are developing a statisticalPOS tagger for the project.104The statistical method has been used on POStaggers since 1960s (Christopher, 2000).
Some ofthese kinds of methods use HMM (HiddenMarkov Model).
The main principle of HMM isto assign the most possible tag to an input wordin a sentence by using the probabilities oftraining data (Brian, 2007 and Daniel, 2000).Figure 2.
Overview of Mongolian Bigram taggerThe probabilities for the bigram tagger arecalculated with the uni-tag frequency, the bi-tagfrequency and the tokens from the training data(see Figure 2 for more detail).4 Automatic POS TaggingOne million words of the Mongolian corpus havebeen tagged as the current result of the project.The tagging procedure is shown in Figure 3.Figure 3.
Automatic Tagging Procedure forMongolian CorpusWhen using the statistical POS tagger, the corpustagging needs a training data.
We have manuallytagged around 110 thousand words.
These 110thousand words are used as the first training data.The statistical information on the first trainingdata is shown in Table 3.Words Word type Texts Tags112,754 21,867 200 185Table 3.
First Training DataAs shown in Table 3, the training data consists of112,754 words.
These words are divided into21,867 types.
This training data can be a goodrepresentative of the corpus because the texts inwhich distinct to total word ratio is higher arechosen (see Table 4).No.
Texts (Files) Distinct WordsTotalWords Percent1.
MNCPR00320 113 125 0.92.
MNCPR00312 157 179 0.873.
MNCPR00118 118 136 0.864.
MNCPR00384 162 187 0.865.
MNCPR00122 238 279 0.856.
MNCPR00085 190 224 0.847.
MNCPR01190 320 379 0.848.
MNCPR00300 159 189 0.849.
MNCPR00497 241 288 0.8310.
MNCPR00362 251 300 0.83Table 4.
Some Texts Chosen for Training DataIn Table 4, some of the texts that are chosen forthe training data are shown.
The mostappropriate text that should be tagged at first isMNCPR00320 because its total words are 125and distinct words are 113.
Consequently, itsequality of words types and total word is almostthe same, 0.9.
The first 200 texts from the corpusare manually tagged for the training data.After training the bigram POS tagger, thecorpus is tagged with it by 100 texts by 100texts.
After that, we manually checked theautomatically tagged texts, and corrected theincorrectly tagged words and tagged theuntagged words, in fact, new words to thetraining data.
After manually checking andtagging, the automatically tagged texts are addedto the training data for improving the taggeraccuracy.
Then, this whole process is done againand again.
After each cycle, the training data isincreased, and the accuracy of the tagger is also105improved.
The statistics of automatic tagging thefirst 100 texts is shown in Table 5.Words Word type Texts TagsUntaggedword73,552 9,854 100 108 16,322Untaggedword typeMistaggedwords Accuracy3,195 310 76.5Table 5.
First 100 Texts Automatically TaggedAs shown in Table 5, the untagged words are 22percent of the total words, and 0.5 percent istagged incorrectly.
Incorrectly tagged words aremanually checked.
The mistagged words arecaused from the insufficient training data.
In theresult of the first automatic tagging, the taggerthat is trained on around 110 thousand words cantag 76.5 percent of around 73 thousand wordscorrectly.In tagging the second 100 texts, the accuracy isalmost the same to the previous one because thetraining data is collected from texts containingmore word types.
The correctly tagged words are78 percent.
After checking and tagging theautomatically tagged 400 texts, the training datais around 260 thousand words as shown in Table6.Words Word types Texts Tags260,312 27,212 400 198Table 6.
Current Training DataWe tagged another 900 texts based on thetraining data in Table 6.
They consist of around860 thousand words, and 81 percent is tagged.The statistics is shown in Table 7.Words Word type Texts868,258 41,939 900UntaggedwordsUntagged wordtypes Accuracy168,090 19,643 81Table 7.
Automatically tagged wordsAs shown in Table 7, the bigram POS taggertrained on 260 thousand words has taggedaround 700 thousand of 868 thousand words.
Theaccuracy is nearly the same to the previoustagging accuracy.
That means the first trainingdata is well selected, and includes main usagewords.
Therefore the accuracy of the first tagged200 texts is very close to that of 900 texts taggedlater.5 ConclusionA research project building a 5 million wordcorpus is in its last phase.
We have automaticallytagged 1 million words of the corpus bydeveloping a POS tagset and a bigram-POStagger for Mongolian.
The tagging accuracy isaround 81 percent depending on the trainingdata.
Currently, the training data is around 260thousand words.
As increasing the training data,the accuracy of the tagger can be up to 90percent.
However, the increasing training datatakes a lot of time and effort.
The tagset currentlyconsists of 198 tags.
It may increase in thefurther tagging.
In this year, we are planning totag and check the 5 million word corpus.AcknowledgmentsHere described work was carried out by supportof PAN Localization Project (PANL10n).ReferencesBrian Roark and Richard Sproat.
