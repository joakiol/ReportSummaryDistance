SYNTACTIC PATTERNS IN A SAMPLEOF TECHNICAL ENGLISHThe Importance of the Concept of HomogeneityA fundamental assumption of statistical linguisticsis that there are differences worthy of note in the fre-quency of various units in certain texts.
At the sameTime, there are differences in frequencies which wouldnot be considered important.
The question is, how is an"important" difference tO be determined?The mesolution of this pmoblem has been made more im-portant by the increasing populamity of statistical ap-pmoaches to questions of style and authorship.
Defini-tions of style from this point of view are based on notionsof distinctiveness and cons is tency in  literary performance.While distinctiveness appears to be the more important com-ponent of style, it is recognized that some consistency isnecessary to lend significance to whatever feature mightbe distinctive.The Deter,nination of HomogeneityFor this discussion we define homogeneity as thesimilarity of parts of the whole with respect to certainfeatures.
For some features it may be perfectly clear,even without counting, that parts of a text or texts froma genre are not alike.
This seems more likely to occurfo r  some features and for some genmes than for others, for-1-example, syntact i cor  phonological constructions in poetry,as opposed to parts of speech in technical writing.Few would be satisfied to rely solely on subjectiveimpression fom the estimation of the similarity of textsamples.
For statistical linguists the decision to countis the foundation of their science.
Fop literary scholarsthe decision to count stems from a desire to give quanti-tative verification of existing theories and interpreta-tions, and to gain greater insight into the structure ofliterary works for the purpose of proposing new theoriesand interpretations.
Both groups are faced with the prob-lem of evaluating the results of the counting.The Nature of Statistical TestsThe techniques of statistical description ame, ofcourse, uniquely suited to the statement of the raw,uninterpreted results.
Measures of location such as means,modes, medians are commonly used for this purpose.In examining the raw results it may be clear at oncethat there is a meaningful difference among the counts orscopes.
If samples of 100 sentences were taken at randomfrom each of  two texts, and the mean lengths for the twosamples were 20 words and W0 words, no one would hesitateto conclude that one text revealed a r'significantly"greater sentence length than the other.
But if the figureswere closer, say 27 and 33, more exact methods ape needed.mIt is a law of nature that a sample taken from a populationwill not always yield exactly the statistics of the popula-Tion, that on occasion even a large discrepancy will befound.
The extent to which sample values may be expectedto vary from population values through chance alone is asubject of mathematical statistics, as is the extent towhich two or more sample values from the same populationwill differ.Language Statistics and HomogeneityThere is considerable data that demonstrates overallsimilarities in the frequencies of various units betweensamples from the same writer, fmom different writers, andeven from different languages.
1 The problem for statis-tical linguistics and stylistics is the ordering of degreesof similarity into groups according to some notion of homo-geneity.
If the sample values differ no more than couldreasonably be attributed to chance, we see no reason whythe populations from which the samples were taken couldnot be called one homogeneous population.Whether text samples pass a statistical test fomhomogeneity depends on the nature of the text~ the choseniSee, for example, Herdan, The Advanced Theory o~f Languageas Choice and Chance, pp.
i--7-/-27, and M. Rensk~"The  Noun-Verb Quotlent in Englxsh and Czech, Phllolo~la Pra~ensla,VIII (1965), pp.
289-302.-3-&-significance level, and the power of the test as deter-mined by characteristics of the test itself in conjunctionWith the size of the sample.
It is possible to imagine aperfectly uniform text, for example, one composed o?nothing more than repetitions of the same identical sentence.In this case, a statistical test will reveal this homogen-eity for any significance level or sample size.
For realtexts, though, the selection of the s.l.
and s.s. poses aproblem of practical and theoretical interest.
The dangeris that an investigator will be tempted to make a flatstatement concerning the homogeneity of a feature for atext or a genre, when a slight change in s.l.
or s.s. couldhave led to a reversal of that finding.
Homogeneity, then,as a product of statistical hypothesis testing, should notbe regarded as a function of the text alone, but ratheras a function of the text and the significance level andpower associated with the test and the sample size.
Ifthe samplesrepresent different populations even if differentonly in some minimal way, it is only a question of increas-ing sufficiently the sample size to cause the hypothesisof homogeneity to be rejected.In discussing the size of samples to be taken, Herdanstates that " fo r  statistical investigations in general, itis usually a question of how small the sample should be--Ifor reasons of economy--without becoming unrepresentativeof the universe, and without the errors acquiring suchdimensions as to make significance testing illusory.
"22 Ib id .
,  p. 170-4-qIt is clear that hard infommation is needed on Theextent to which parts of a single text will differ withrespect to the frequency of various measured units.
ITis also clear that different units may occur with vamyingdegrees of consistency throughout a text.
The questionof the homogeneity of a text is complex.
But until Thenature of variation within texts is understood, s ta tementsabout variation between texts cannot be made with greatauthority.The Design of the StudyA suitable model for the study of quantitative changein linguistic behavior is one which views change as takingplace along dimensions, such that if two texts vary signi-ficantly in the proportion or distribution of one or moreunits, this difference would be attributed to the two textsoccupying different positions in a context space.
The exam-ination of other texts of varying similarity to each ofthe original two texts should lead to the description offactors (dimensions) responsible for the original observeddifference.
The proposed dimensions can then be testedby predicting the behavior of texts not yet examined.In this study we propose to examine some aspects ofthe statistical behavior of certain syntactic units in asample of technical English.
In this as in any other studywe must carefully set our goals and gather an appropriate--5--hamount of data to carry them out.The major focus of this study wil l  be on the varia-t ion in frequency of syntact ic units within the writ ingof two individuals.
A pr imary hypothesis to be tested isthat the distr ibut ions of units wil l  remain l~easonablythe same throughout a single text written by one person.If the distr ibut ions are not uniform~ several explanationscould be offered.
For example~ the varying content couldinf luence the frequencies; that is, even in a single textthere might be contextual variations.
A comparison ofthe indiv idual  chapters should reveal such variat ionssince the chapters represent the way in which the contenthas been divided in the text.
For this reason the chapterswi l l  be compared with each other in each of the two texts.There may be other causes for internal dif ferencesin a text.
During the time that the text was written vari-ous c ircumstances could have arisen to inf luence the fre-quencies.
This study does not attempt, however, to accountfor such inf luences except as they may be co~related withchapter  content and position.The other pr imary hypothesis  to be tested is thatthe two sample texts wi l l  reveal essential ly the samedistr ibut ions.
Several studies have compared samples oftechnical  wr i t ing as a whole with samples of non-technicalIwrit ing, but no one-seems to have reported on the varia-t ion in l inguist ic  performance among individual American--6--v-techn ica l  wr i te rs .In o rder  to  be sure  that  d i f fe rences  between thetexts  wou ld  be a t t r ibutab le  as much as poss ib le  to  thewr i te rs  themse lves  i t  was dec ided  to  se lec t  the  sampletexts  f rom the  same d isc ip l ine .

Whi le  i t  mayseem unreasonab le  to  be l ieve  that  b io logy  and h i s to rywritings could exhibit distinctive patterns, there isalso no inherent reason why technical and non-technicalshould vary.The texts selected for this study are both fromlinguistics.

25-82, excluding bibliographical sections.The choice of linguistics as the technical field wasarbitrary.
These samples of technical writing cannot beregarded as-random samples of technical writing as a whole,or even of linguistic writing, or even of Bach's or Pike'swriting.
The requirement of this study for large amountsof data from single texts precluded the possibility of gain-ing representativeness through the use of many smallersamples.
Factors leading to the selection of the particu-lar text by Bach were its relative shortness as a complete-7-book, its recent publication date, and the varied materialcovered.
The three chapters by Pike may be regarded as asmaller control sample to be available to confirm any majorconclusions for the Bach sample.
Moreover, it was ?eltthat Pike exhibited a rather different approach to sentenceconstruction from Bach, and that this difference, whendemonstrated quantitatively, would dispel any notion thattechnical writers could not show individual styles.
Forconvenience the samples from Bach and Pike will be referredto hereafter as simply Bach and Pike.Before conducting a statistical investigation of textsvarious parameters or units must be selected which laterwill be counted and used as the basis for determining thesimilarity of the samples to be compared.

For each chapter (8 inBach, 3 in Pike) the occurrences or tokens of each of Theclause and sentence Types were counted and compared.
Thechi-square test was employed To determine the validity ofthe assumption that the chapters in each text can be re-garded as random samples from one population.The counting and statistical analysis was carried outthrough the facilities of the Michigan Terminal System atthe University of Michigan Computing Center.
This time-sharing system is presently driven by two IBM System/360-67 processors.
The clause level unit analysis programswere written in assembly language and FORTRAN IV.
The sen-Tence type counting was programmed in SNOBOL~.Results for BachTable 2 depicts the frequency counts of the five clausetypes in Bach.
Here considerable variation is apparent,especially in the be clause and the passive clause.
Thethere and i_~t clause frequencies appear to be relativelyconstrained.
The assumption that The chapters may be re-garded as random samples from one population must berejected.The frequency of the most common sentence types inBach is illustrated in Table 3.
The percentages given inthe table represent the proportion of a sentence type amongthe five sentence Types listed.
It was expected that afew sentence types would occur quite often, and that manyTypes would be found only once.

The main passive Type (MS) occums least in chap-ters 1 and 8, the introduction and the conclusion.
Thisis consistent with the notion of the passive clause beinghighly comrelated with technical material.
Of course, themain passive type is not the only source of passive clauses.The active plus subordinate passive type (M45) listed inthe table also pmovides one passive clause per sentence.We find that this type has its lowest frequencies in chap-ters 4 and 7.
Theme is, then, no strong correlation be-tween sentence types on the basis that they both containpassive clauses.Bach and Pike ComparedTable 4 depicts the distmibution of clauses in Pike.As for Bach, the assumption that the chapters mepmesentrandom samples from one population must be mejected.
Asin Bach, the passive vamies considerably fmom chaptem tochaptem.
Bach's fimst chaptem, the intmoduction, has theIsmallest propomtion of passives but Pike's fimst chaptemhas the most passives.
Bach's be clauses range fmom 15.8-14-per cent to 30.5 per cent, but Pike's be clauses are morestable, ranging from 16.1 per cent to 22.4 per cent.Pike's act ive and passive clauses are also more consistent,but with eight chapters it must be taken into account thatBach has a greater opportunity to reveal inconsistency.Bach appears to use sl ightly more b__ee clauses, many feweractive clauses, and somewhat more passive and it clauses.The dif ference in the frequency of  there clauses does notseem substantial.
A chi-square test comparing Bach's andPike's clause totals yields a probabi l i ty  far less than.001.TABLE 4CLAUSE DISTRIBUTION FOR PIKEClause TypeChapterBe Act ive Passive There It1 51 143 76 II 617.8% 49.8% 26.5% 3.8% 2.1%2 145 338 132 15 1722.4% 52.2% 20.4% 2.3% 2.6%3 60 227 65 17 416.1% 60.9% 17.4% 4.6% 1.1%Total 256 708 273 43 2719.6% 54.2% 20.9% 3.3% 2.1%Chi-square value: 23.19Probabil ity: between .001 and .005.-15-1We recal l  that in examining Bach's sentence typesonly a handful occurred with suff icient frequency in eachchapter to al low stat ist ical  testing, in spite of asample of almost 2000 sentences.
There are far fewer sen-Tences in the Pike sample of 446 sentences, and in addit ionPike appears to use proport ional ly  more sentence Types dueto his preference for sentences with four or more clauses,copies of which are not l ikely to be found again.
It isnot surpris ing, then, That just two or three sentence typesoccur often enough for Testing.
Rather than attempt anyjudgment on the consistency of Pike's sentence types onsuch meager evidence, we proceed to a summary of the mostfrequent sentence types in Pike and Bach.The results, given in Table 5, clearly indicate theauthors' di f ferent preferences, but at the same time themeare marked simi lar it ies in their  frequency of usage ofsome types, for example the M34 and M43 types.
We must re-member that Bach's most common sentence types were shownto be strongly non-homogeneous, and thus the data inTable 5 cannot be regarded as highly predict ive of the per-formance to be found in other Bach samples.
Because ofthis great internal inconsistency a chi-square test wasnot carr ied out on the data in Table 5.IConclusionsThis study has produced, we believe, much useful andinterest ing data which leads to several major  conclusions-16-TABLE 5mOST FREQUENT SENTENCE TYPES IN BACH AND PIKERank PropOro Proper.

The evidence given here is strongly againstsuch a model, but it is not certain whether the di f f icultywith such a model  is to be traced to non-random samplingfrom a constant population, or random sampling from achanging populat ion, or non-random sampling froma changing population.
Moreover, it is not clear how anyone of the three alternat ive models could be demonstratedsuperior  to any of the others, since there seems to be noway to d ist inguish empir ical ly  between the effects of non-random sampling and a changing population.The random sample-uni form populat ion (RSUP) model fora single wr i ter  appears to be the foundation for manystudies in stat ist ical  styl ist ics and l inguistics, al-though this is often not expressed in any explicit  way.These studies are designed as follows.
The hypothesis isthat two or more writers or genres differ substant ia l lyin the use of one or more l inguist ic units such as sentencetype, sentence length, adject ive-verb ratio, etc.
Brinegar,for example, has stated this hypothesis in this way:The use of this method assumes that everyauthor unconsciously  uses w6rds that, atleast in the long run, could be consideredas random drawings from a fixed frequencydistr ibut ion of word lengths.
This should-18-be true at least for writ ings of a relatedtype over a reasonable span of years.
3A null  hypothesis of no signif icant dif ference (homo-geneity) is tested through the drawing of random samplesfrom the writers or genres and the selection of a stat-istical test and a signif icance level.
The sample sizesare chosen on the basis of their being large enough to berepresentat ive of the writers or genres.
The test isapplied to the sample data and the null hypothesis iseither maintained or rejected.
Thus homogeneity is ablack or white proposit ion in This approach, a functionof the vagueness of sample size and signif icance level.The RSUP model interprets the discovery of a statis-t ical ly "signif icant" dif ference between writers orgenres as something unexpected and hence worthy of note,meaning that the writers or genres represent dist inctpopulations.
Yet, the demonstrat ion of stat ist ical lysignif icant differences is something to be expected witha suff ic iently large sample size.
What is needed is anapproach which takes sample size out of immediate consi-deration and relat ivizes the concept of homogeneity.3Claude S. Brinegar, "Mark Twain and the Quintus CurtiusSnodgrass Letters: A Statist ical Test of Authorship,"Journal of the American Statist ical  Associat ion, LVIII~arch,  1963), p. 87.-19-1There is really no intuitive support for the notionof the homogeneity of linguistic units as something abso-lute.
There is nothing intuitively objectionable about astatement that one feature is more or less consistent thananother.This study is not the first, of course, To use largeenough sample sizes within a genre to demonstrate verysignificant internal differences.
A recent analysis ofsome aspects of the Brown University corpus reveals suchdifferences within fifteen genres for parts of the sentencelength distribution in words, using the chi-square test.There was no attempt to relativize the results of thechi-square test, but sentence length was described for eachgenre in terms of The mean, standard deviation, and co-efficient of variation, the latter being the standard de-viation divided by the mean, a measure better suited thanthe standard deviation alone to indicate the extent of dis-persion in the distribution.An investigation of The homogeneity of individualvocabulary items between genres revealed once again verysignificant differences.
5 Rather than settle for a state-Henry Kucera and W. Nelson Francls, ComputationalAnalysis of Present-Day American English (Providence,RfI.
: Brown University Press, 1957),, pp.
378-379.5Ibid., pp.
277-293~-20-menT that certain words were found to be non-homogeneousin the corpus at certain sample sizes, Mosteller proposesan "index of contextuality" as a measure of relative con-sistency for a specific word.
6 This index is computed bydividing the chi-square value by The sample size and thenmultiplying by i000.
The effeoT is To treat each sampleas if it consisted of exactly i000 units~ and the resultingindex can be used to rank The homogeneity of individualwords.
In This fashion Mosteller computes indexes of 6.2,6.9, and 9.6 for to, and, and the, which were the leastcontextual~ or least influenced in frequency by context,in the Brown corpus.The second major conclusion of this study is that anindex like Mosteller's is an appropriate way %o treat homo-geneity in a corpus.
Using this approach to study differentwriters one would segment each writer's works into n seg-ments, Take random samples, preferably of equal size, fromeach of the segments and compute an index of contextualityfor each feature measured.
If there is a central tendencyin a feature for the w~iters~ an index of contextualityfor pairs of writers considered Together may be computedas a measure of Their variance.6F.
Mosteller~ "Association and Estimation in ContingencyTables," Journal Of the American Statistical AssOciation,LXIII (March~ 1968), pp.
1-28.-21-1Such a comparison of indexes of contextual i typre-supposes a consistent number of segments and data divisions(parts of speech, sentence length gmoupings, etc.
), sincethese lead to the degrees of freedom of the contingencytable, and for a greater number of degrees of freedom agreater chi-square value is expected for a given deviationfrom randomness.
Nevertheless, for purposes of rough com-parison one may wish to examine the homogeneity of featureswith different underlying degrees of freedom.
Anotherindex should be of interest in this regard: the samplesize necessary to reject the null hypothesis at a levelof .001.
This index is in a way more concrete than theindex of contextuality in that The degree of consistencyis related to the number of units being measured.
Moreimportant, the degrees of freedom is taken into account.For the index of contextuality a higher value means lessuniformity for the feature, while a higher value for therejection size means more uniformity.Table 6 gives values for these two indexes for anumber of features as a basis for determining The relativesimilarity of Bach and Pike.
As can be seen, the twowriters agree relatively closely on the ratio of main tosubordinate clauses of the passive type, but differ greatlyon this same ratio for the there type.,-22-We believe that the categomization of clause andsentence types used here is reasonable and simple, andthat this sort of categomization would be readily appli-cable to other languages.
In addition, statistical measuressuch as the index of contextuality and rejection sizeappear to be quite useful as indicators of the consis-tency of linguistic performance.-23-TABLE 6INDEX VALUES FOR BACH AND PIKE COBPARED-Feature Degrees o f  Index o f  Re ject ionFreedom Contextua l i ty  SizeWord Level  15 1.7 22200Clause Level  4 l l .
