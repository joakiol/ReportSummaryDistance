The program uses  in terna l  syntact i c  andsemant ic  expectat ions  to ana lyze  the  texts  and cocor rec t  e r ro rs  that  a r i se  dur ing  unders tand ing ,such  as syntact i c  e r ro rs ,  miss ing  punctuat ion ,  ander rors  of  spe l l ing  and usage .

Th is  paper  descr ibes  some of  theknowledge mechan isms that  have been implemented inthe  NOMAD sys tem.I .
I n t roduct ionCons ider  the  fo l low ing  message ,LOCKED ON OPEN FIRED DIW.This is an actual naval message containing sentenceboundary  prob lems,  miss ing  sub jec ts  and ob jec ts ,  anincor rec t  verb  con jugat ion ,  and an abbrev ia t ion  fo r"dead in  water . "
The NAVY rece ives  many thousandsof  shor t  messages  l i ke  the  one above in  very"sc ru f fy"  form,  and these  messages  have =o be putin to  a more readab le  form before  they  can be passedthrough many hands .
Hence there  i s  an obv iousbenef i t  co par t ia l l y  automat ing  th i s  encod ingprocess.Most la rge  text -unders tand ing  sys tems todaywould not  be ab le  to automate  the  encod ing  processment ioned  above because  they  were des igned  underthe  assumpt ion  chat  the  input  text  cons i s ts  ofwe l l - fo rmed and logical sentences  such  as newspapers to r ies  and o ther  ed i ted  texts .
The NOMAD sys tem,however ,  was des igned  to unders tand  nava l  text  thatconta ins  ungra~at ica i  or on ly  par t ia l l y  completesentences .Th is  paper  exp la ins  some knowledge mechanismsthat  under l ie  the  reader ' s  ab i l i ty  Co unders tandsc ru f fy  text  and how these  mechanisms areimplemented w i th in  the  NOMAD sys tem.Th is  research  was suppor ted  in  par t  by the  NavalOcean Systems Center  g rant  N00123-81-C- I078.I I .
Categor ies  of Er rorsWe have encountered  the  fo l low ing  prob lems inunders tand ing  Navy messages .
They are  l i s ted  inthe  order  o f  f requency  o f  the i r  occur rences .
Theorder  was determined  by examin ing  the  l i s t  ofmessages  prov ided  by the  Naval  Ocean SystemsCenter .
For each  er ror  type ,  NOMAD's method o frecogn iz ing  and cor rec t ing  the  prob lem aredescr ibed ,  and the  ~Jodule which i s  respons ib le  fo rthe  cor rec t ion  i s  ident i f ied .A.
Unknown wordsCons ider  the  message ,PEGASUS FRD 2 TALOS AT VICTORNOMAD does not  i -~ed ia te ly  recogn ize  "FRD" as aword in  the  d ic t ionary .
O f ten  the  message  senderv i i i  use  an ad hoc abbrev ia t ion  o f  a word ormisspe l l  a word.
Any word not  found Co be in thed ic t ionary  i s  f i r s t  put  th rough a s imp le  spe l l ingcor rec t ion  procedure .
I f  none of  the  poss ib lecor rec t ions  a re  recogn izab le  then  a morpho log ica lana lyzer  i8 app l ied  to recogn ize  d i f fe rent  poss ib lecon jugat ions  o f  a a verb .I f  th i s  fa i l s ,  a mechan ism ca l led  FOUL-UP(Granger ,  1977) i s  t r iggered .
The FOUL-UPmechan ism hand les  unknown words by us ing  theprogram's own syntactic and semantic expectationsCo create a temporary definition Chat would allowic continue normally.
FOOL-UP would later revisethe definition of the unknown word by combining theexpectat ions  generated  based on prev iousin fo rmat ion  w i th  the  ro le  the  unknown word i sp lay ing  in  the  cur rent  context .B.
Xissiu~ subject  an_~d objectsCons ider  the  following message  of twosentences,CONSTELLATION SAW KASNIN.
LOST CONTACT.A scr ip t -based  (Schank and Abe lson ,  1977)i n fe rencer  generates  expectat ions  to fill thesub jec t  and ob jec t  of  each sentence .
Here,  theword "SAW" as a con jugat ion  of  "SEE" would g ivea r i se  to expectat ions  re la ted  to detect ion  and104i dent i f i ca t ion .
The in fe rencer  a l so  uses  knowledgeabout  typ ica l  sequences  of events  (identify beforef i re )  (Cu l l ing ford ,  1977) and re la t ionsh ips  betweenthe i r  par t i c ipants  ( f r iend  and foe) .C.
Ambi2uous word usageExamine the  fo l low ing  massage ,CONTACT GAINED ON KASHIN.The example can be in terpreted  as e i ther  "Contactwas ga ined  on Kash in"  mean in  K '~e  contacted  Kash in"or "Our contact  (e sh ip )  made head ing  towardsKash in . "
NOMAD p icks  one o f  the  mul t ip le  maaninEsof the  ~ i&uous  word, and ca l l s  a blame ass ignzenCmodule to check for  goa l  v io la t ions ,  phys ica limposs ib i l i t i es ,  and o ther  semant ic  conf l i c t s  tomake sure  that  the  in terpreta t ion  was cor rec t .
I fthe  module detects  any conf l i c t ,  NOMAD at tempts  Counders tand  the  sentence  us ing  a a d i f fe rent  meaningof  the  ambiguous word.D.
M iss ing  sentence  and c~ause boundaT iesCons ider  the  fo l low ing  message ,VISUALLY LOCKED ON AND TRACKING CHALLENGED UNIT NOREI~LT OPEN FIRED TIME 0129.1NOMAD uses  semant ic  expectat ions  end syntact i cexpectat ions  to detect  miss ing  boundar ies .
"VISUALLY LOCKED ON" i s  unders tood  Co be ?
completesentence  because  there  a re  no expecac ione  pend ingwhen "AND" i s  read .
"TRACKinK" i s  unders tood  co bethe  verb  of the  second sentence .
With a verbchosen and expecat ions  fo r  an ac tor  pend ing ,?CRALLZNCED" i s  used as an adverb  descr ib ing"UNIT'.
The second phrase  ends be fore  "NO REPLY.
.
. "
as aga in  there  e re  no expecac ions  pending aCchin po in t .
The phrase  "NO REPLY" has  expectat ionsfor communicat ion verbs  to follow it, and thus  whenthe  c lause  "OPEN FIRED" i s  encountered ,  the  f ina lsentence  boundr 7 is  ident i f ied .E.
WTonK tenseCons ider  the  fo l low ing  f ragment  sentence  fromour f i r s t  example ,OPEN FIRED.The ~orpho log ica l  ana lyzer  i s  used a l so  to cor rec tthe tense of a word.
eg.
OPEN FIRED --> OPENFIRE.
The scr ip t -based  inferencer then determinesthe tense of the given action using its knowledgeabout typical sequences of events, eg.
LOCKED ON.OPEN FIRED.
- ->  LOCKED ON.
OPENED FIRE.III.
Human InterfaceNOMAD uses  a generator  spec i f i ca l l y  des ignedfor the  nava l  domain co produce a yell formedtranslation of the input message.

ConclueionsThe ab i l i ty  to unders tand text  i s  dependent onthe ab i l i ty  to unders tand what is  being descr ibedin the text .
~ence,  a reader  o f ,  say ,  Eng l i sh  textmust have app l i cab le  knowledge of both thes i tuat ions  chat may be descr ibed  in texts  (e .g .
,ac t ions ,  scares ,  sequences of events ,  goa ls ,methods of ach iev ing  goa ls ,  e tc . )
and the thesur face  s t ruc tures  that  appear in  the language,i .e .
,  the re la t ions  between the sur face  order  ofappearance of words and phrases ,  and the i rcor respond ing  meaning s t ruc tures .The process  of text  unders tand ing  i s  thecombined app l i ca t ion  of these  knowledge sources  asa reader  proceeds through a text .
This  fac tbecomes c leares t  when we invest igate  theunders tand ing  of texts  that  p resent  par t i cu la rproblems to a reader .
Human unders tand ing  isinherent ly  to le rant ;  people are natura l l y  able toignore mtny types of e r ro r | ,  omiss ions ,  poorconst ruc t ions ,  e tc .
