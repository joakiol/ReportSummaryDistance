DECOMPOSITION OF JAPANESE SENTENCES INTO NORMAL FORMSBASED ON HUMAN LINGUISTIC PROCESSTsutomu Endo Tuneo TamatiDepartment of Information Scienceand Systems EngineeringOita UniversityOita 870-11, JapanDepartment of Information SystemsGraduate School of Engineering SciencesKyushu UniversityFukuoka 812, JapanA diversity and a flexibility of languageexpression forms are awkward problems for themachine processing of language, such as trans-lation, indexing and question-answering.
Thispaper presents a method of decomposing Japanesesentences appearing in the Patent Documents on"Pulse network", into normal forms.
First, thelinguistic information is analysed and classi-fied based on the human linguistic process.Then, predicate functions, phrase functions andoperators are introduced as the normal forms.Finally, the decomposing procedure and someexperimental results are shown.IntroductionOne of the most remarkable features ofnatural language is a diversity and a flexibil-ity of its expression form.
Especially,Japanese appears to have a peculiar syntacticstructure because it is an agglutinativelanguage.
This is an awkward problem for themachine processing of language, such as trans-lation, subject indexing and question-answering.An approach to dealing with this problem is totransform the sentences into some normal formsif any.
Proposals for such normalization havebeen made for some time, but there have beenfew attempts.l, 2The normal form needs to have every infor-mation which is contained in original sentences.Let us now consider what information thesentences contain.
In human linguistic process,the objects to be exprssed are provided first,then the cognitive structure corresponding tothem is formed, and lastly the language expres-sion based on the cognitive structure isproduced.
In other words, the immediate basisof language expression is considered to behuman cognitive structure.
Therefore, thearrangement of words in sentences representsnot only the relation among objects in theexternal world, but also the cognitions and therelations among them, which are relativelyindependent of the present objects.This paper presents a method of decomposingJapanese sentences into normal forms based onsuch human linguistic process.
First of all,the linguistic information necessary for decom-posing process is analysed and classified fromthe above mentioned point of view.
Then,predicate functions, phrase functions andoperators are introduced as the normal forms.Two kinds of function describe the syntacticstructure of the sentences and phrases.
Theoperator describes the relationship among func-tions.
Finally, the decomposing procedure andsome experimental results are shown.
Samplesentences are selected from the claim points ofthe Japanese Patent Documents on "pulse network".Analysis of linguistic informationIn this section, we analyse and classifythe linguistic information necessary for decom-posing Japanese sentences into their normalforms.Classification of wordsFrom the standpoint of the linguistic process,that is, objects, cognitions and expressions,all words are divided into objective expressionsW 1 and subjective expressions W 2.
W 1 is the setof expressions which reflect external objects,namely, conceptual expressions.
On the otherhand, W 2 is the set of cognitive expressionswithout conceptual process, and immediatelyrepresents the affection, judgement, desire,will and so on.
The detail of the classifica-tion of words is summarized in Table i.
We givesupplementary explanations about Table i.Adjective ~ is the words which are called stemof adjectival verb in the traditional Japanesegrammar.
For inflectional words such as AAn,Vn, TB n and JJn, we specify n as i, 2, 3, 4,and 5(6) according to inflectional forms, thatis, negative, declinable word modifying, final,noun modifying, and conditional(imperative)form respectively.Analysis of cognitive structureIn order to describe the content of words andthe relation among words, we introduce thedescriptive scheme M which consists of suchfive descriptors as follows;M = < O, E, U, ~, A >.
(i) 0 = {s~l(substance) , a~2(attribute), r~3(relation)}.
0 is the cognitive unit formedby separating and abstracting the externalobjects ideally, and is classified into threelarge categories, namely, substances, attributesand relations.
The symbol ~i specifies thevariety and the abstracting level of each unit.Thus, 0 is regarded as the classification ofconcepts in the objective world (e.g., pulsenetwork).
(2) ~ = {oi, o2, 03}.
E describes the rela-tionship between objects from the various viewpoints, o I is the relationship between sub-stance and attribute, o 2 is the relationshipbetween substance and relation, and o 3 is the492-various connection of the same kind of objects.
(3) U represents the active cognitions whichare relatively independent of concepts.
(4) ~ specifies the cognitive behaviors how thespeaker cognize the objects.
(5) A = {if(tense), 12(anaphora)}.
A representsthe relation between a speaker and objects.A part of O, Z, U and ~ is tabulated inTable 2-5 respectively.Definition of predicate functionIn this section and following two sections,we define the normal forms of Japanese sentences~Generally, a sentence expresses the property ofan object, or the relationship among objects.The component which indicates such property orrelationship, is the predicate of a sentence.So we introduce the function, the constants ofwhich are the predicate and the case postposi-tions, and the variables of which are nounphrases just in front of case postpositions.This function is called predicate function andis expressed byXlalX2a2...Xiai...XnanPwhere Xi, a i and P indicate the noun phrase, thecase postposition and the predicate respectively.\[Example\]I.

For example, averb is frequently connected with some aux-iliary verbs(e.g., NAl(negative), TA(past))or verbal suffixes(e.g., RARERU(passive),SASERU(causative)).
Therefore, we decom-pose the predicate P into objectiveexpression Po and subjective expression Ps.Then, we define the basic predicate functionas the function which donsists of thefollowing four kinds Of predicate PoPs .
(i) Po(Final form of verb) Ps(Zero elementof speaker's judgement),(2) Po(Final form of adjective I) Ps(Zeroelement of speaker's judgement),(3) Po(Adjective ~)  Ps(Judgementexpression "DA(be)"),(4) Po(Noun) Ps(Judgement expression"DA(be) ").The application of operators presented innext section, inflects the form of Po or Ps.Other predicate functions are defined by theapplication of operators to basic predicatefunctions.
Thus, the predicate functionsare classified as follows.f Constant functionPredicate (ideomatic expression)function Basic predicate functionDerivative functionThe predicate generally represents someattribute concept.
Unlike substances anattribute does not occur alone.
It arisesaccompanying substances.
When we cognize anattribute as the concept, there exist some sub-stances which accompany this attribute.
Thevariables corresponding to these substances arecalled obligatory variables of the predicate,and the case postpositions, obligatory ones aei.On the other hand, one substance usually accom-panies various kinds of attribute, and isrelated to other substances as a mediation ofthis attribute.
In the predicate function, thevariables corresponding to such attributes andsubstances are called facultative variables, andthe  case postpositions, facultative ones aoi.The variables of a predicate function havesome domains of their own, that is to say, sub-stitutable word classes.
So we specify thedomain of variables in terms of the descriptor O.Also, the relationship between the predicate andeach variable is given by the descriptor E.These are summarized in Table 6.Definition of operatorsThe operator produces a new function fromone or two functions.
They are classified intosix groups, that is, modal(Fl) , nominalization(FII), embedding(fill), connecting(FIV),elliptical(F V) and anaphoric operator(Fvl).Modal operatorThe modal operators consist of the objectiveexpressions Fil(e.g.
, abstract verb, verbalsuffix, a part of prefix) and the subjectiveexpressions Fi2(e.g.
, auxiliary verb, adverbialpostposition).
FII applies to Po of the predi-Table 3 List of descriptorSymbol Descriptor ExampleIf.

)The clause or noun phrase which is producedby the application of the nominalization operator,is substituted in the variable of other predicatefunction by embedding operator fIII.Connecting operatorA connecting operator joins one predicate func-tion to another coordinately or subordinately.Generally, it corresponds to conjunctions andconjunctive postpositions.
Some operators arerelated to modal operators, attribute adverbs,or variety of predicate.
It is classified intofollowing six groups.

)Generally, more than one connecting opera-tor is applied in the actual sentences.
So wedefine the universal connecting formula asfollows.
Let fII and fIII be the nominalizationand the embedding operator respectively.
Anarbitrary predicate function A i is expressed byA i = Ail*fivl*Ai2*flVl*...*fIVl*Aik*fIVl* .
*fIViAi mwhere Ai k is(i) Su,(~) \[Ai*flVd*Aj\] (d = 2,3,4,5,6).Su is the basic predicate function, or thederivative function which is produced by theapplication of more than one modal operator, andis called unit predicate function.
Moreover,the embedding operator is sometimes applied toSu in the following way.Su(flll-A~, A~,...., A~,..., A~)where A~ = fiiAi .Other operatorsWhen one predicate function is produced by theapplication of the connecting operator to twofunctions, the elliptical operator omits the oneof the same expression forms in the two functionsand anaphoric operator replaces the one of thesame expression forms with the pronoun.Definition of phrase functionWe introduce the phrase function in orderto describe the structure of noun phrases orcompound words.
However, it is not easy todefine the phrase function based on the wordclass, unlike the predicate function.
So weclassify the phrases according to their content,and define the phrase function based on thisclassification.
An example of phrase functionis listed in Table 9.G 1 is the phrase connected in terms of suchrelational concepts as position(rl) , reference(r2) , and part(rs).
G 2 is the phrase formed bycognitive behaviors(Y), such as enumeration(@10,@II), cognition of one object from the variousview point(@9) , concrete and abstract cognitionof one object(~7), and so on.
G 3 is the phraseconstructed in terms of the relationship(o I)between substance and attribute, and the various- -496-connection(o 3) of the same kind of objects.G 4 is other phrases.Decomposition processThe new derivative functions canbe produced by the application of thevarious operators to the basic predicatefunctions.
This means that the sentenceswith complex syntactic structure correspondto one predicate function.
Therefore, thenormalization of sentences is the decom-position of the predicate function corre-sponding to these sentences, into a set ofbasic predicate functions, phrase func-tions and operators.
In this section, wedescribe the decomposing procedure 4.Machine dictionaryA machine dictionary consists of threeelementary dictionaries, that is, worddictionary(WD), predicate function dic-tionary(PFD) and related concept diction-ary(RCD).
WD is utilized to acquire thebasic linguistic information of each wordsin input sentences.
PFD is given to thecandidate word for predicate, such as verb,adjective, and so on, and is used to extractthe predicate function from sentences andphrases.
RCD is stored with the relationbetween concepts, and is used for not onlythe decision of embedded phrase but alsothe analysis of phrases.
Table i0 shows anexample of each dictionary.Procedural descriptionGeneral flow of decomposition process.The general procedural flow and the dataflow of decomposition process are shown inFig.l and Fig.2 respectively.
Input Japa-nese sentences spelled in Roman letters aresegmented word by word with spaces.Each word is matched with entry wordsof WD.
The word Iist(WLIST) is constructedbased on the information from WD.
Thecandidate for predicate (e.g., verb, adjec-tive) is found by searching WLIST from thehead of the list.
Then, the modal operator(Fill, FII 2 and FI21) , embedding operatorfill and connecting operator FIV are extract-ed by investigating the variety and theinflectional form of the predicate or thewords which follow the predicate.
Theextracting method of these operators is shownin Fig.3.
The extracted information isstored in FLIST 1 and CLIST.
The variablesof the predicate function are extracted byreference to PFD.

If the obligatory variable of thefunction is omitted, the word whose conceptis coincident with the domain of thevariable, is found from the extracted wordstring in WLIST.

The extracted information isstored FLIST I, and the word strings of thevariables are stored in VLIST.
These wordstrings are decomposed into basic predicatefunctions, nominalization operators andphrase functions, and then stored in FLIST 2and GLIST.
The above procedure are repeat-ed for other predicate candidates.
Finally,the connecting formula which indicates therelation among predicate functions are form-ed by reference to CLIST.Processing of phrases.
At first, theprocedure finds the candidate for predicate,such as dynamic attribute noun, declinableword modifying form of common verb, prefix(e.g., "KOO(high)", "TEl(low)", "DAl(large)",,etc.)
and adjective II, from the word stringsstored in VLIST.
If the candidate is found,the basic predicate function, nominalizationoperator and embedded word are extracted.
Ifnot, the phrase function are extracted.
Theyare classified into three types according todecision method.\[Type I\] Phrase functions extracted by thefeatures of their constant.
The example aregl01, g201, g301, and so on, in Table 9.Their constants, such as "RYeS(both)", "KAN(between)", "TAHOe(another)", "DAI", "KS",etc., are given the priority based on thestrength of the connectability to variable,and are stored in constant list.
The phrasefunction of this type is extracted according topriority.\[Type II\] Phrase functions extracted by using RCD.The examples are g105, g308, and so on.\[Type III\] Phrase functions extracted by usingthe variety or level of word concept.
Forexample, g20'3 is extracted by investigatingwhether the upper concepts of both words agreewith each other or not, and g204 is done byinvestigating whether the concept of second wordInput sentences I1~&IST Word category, Inflectional formCode, ConceptPointer to other dictionaryFLIST l VLISTNumber of variable /~ (Variable i)Index of variable i Word stringCase pos tposition IndexIndex of variahle 2 .

The latter analysesword string based on the key word.
This is ad-vantageous for the processing of Japanese sen-tences in which the word order variation and theembedding appear frequently.The procedure was programmed by the assemblylanguage of TOSBAC-40C mini computer.
Theexperimental results for sentences in 30 docu-ments confirmed the adequacy of our procedure.The examples of phrases and sentences processingare shown in Fig.4-5.ConclusionThis paper have presented the method ofdecomposing Japanese sentences into normal forms.This method has following desirable advantages:(i) The descriptive scheme M which describes theword content and the relation among words, isintroduced based on the human linguistic process.This will be useful for language processing in-cluding the pragmaties in the future.
(2) The normal forms which consist of the basicpredicate function, phrase function and operator,are interpreted according to the descriptivescheme M. This is useful for the semanticprocessing of input sentences.
(3) The structure of considerably long sentencescan be described by the embedding and connectingoperators.
(4) The structural description of phrases orcompound words is useful to reduce the amount ofstorage for word dictionary.
(5) The normal forms of sentences can serve asinput data for an automatic subject indexing orabstracting of documents in the informationretrieval system 5'6The problems left unsolved are word segmen-tation of input Japanese sentences, detection ofsyntactic and semantic ambiguity, and semantic***INPUT SENTENCE***1 TUI  NO PHOTO:TRANSISTOR NO COLLECTOR KAN 41 TAGAI NI GYAKU-HEIRETU NO IfAKKDO-DlODE WO SEFUZOKU ST TE , DOOTUU SURU 3EKI P~IOTO-TRANSISTOR WO HOST SURU YO0 NI HIKARI-KETUGO0 SASE , PHOTO-TRANSISTOR NO BAKE NI KOOGO NI KUWAE RARERU HIKARI SlNGO0 NI YORI HANTEN SURU FE .
