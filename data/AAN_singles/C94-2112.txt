We discuss generally the role oftype and sortal coercion operations in the selnantics,and specifically the conditions on the application ofcoercion in aspectual predicates and other contexts.We reply to some recent discussion regarding the useof coercion in the grammar, and show that type chang-ing operations are both useful and explanatory mecha-nisms for capturing linguistic and computatioiml gclleraliza.tions.1 IntroductionRecently, work in computational semantics andlexical semantics has made an interesting shift.Motivated by a concern for lexical organizationand global coherence in tl~e structure of thelanguage lexicon, some researchers ha,w~ movedtowards more expressive semantic descriptions(\[16, 1, 5, 101), as well a.s more powerful meth-ods of composition (\[22, 3\]).Some, however, have expressed reservations a.sto the general applicability of type-changing op-erations uch as coercion, as well as the notion ofa generative lexicon itself (\[7\]).
In this pa.per, weaddress these c.riticisms directly, and show that,upon closer examination of the data, these cri-tiques either miss the.
point or are not substantiated by the data.
Still, without a proper no-tion of constraints on coercion, there can indeedbe overgeneration f forms a.nd interpretations inthe semantics, and in fact, the notion of con-ditions on coercion has always been integral tothe basic spirit of Generative Lexicon Theory (el'.\[19\]).
The empirical study of the range and lim-its of type change and cocomposition operationsin natural anguage is an essentia.l part of the re-search in formal smnantics.
The advantages ac-companying elmrative mechanisnls and the char-acterization of languages as lmlymorphic in well-defined ways far outweight the explanatory in-adequacies inherent in traditional approaches tolexical design and semantic projection, what \[22\]have called word sense enumeration approaches.2 Polymorphic Languages andSemantic ExpressivenessWe will a, ssulne s(3me geueraJ familiarity with theframework of generative lexicon theory, as out-lined in \[16, 18, 1\].
~'e feel it is important,  how-ever, to clarify the motivating principles and gen-era.l methodology behind SllCh work, since thesepoints seem to be overlooked or misunderstoodby some authors (\[7\]).In order to help characterize the generativepower of natura.l languages in terms of seman-tic expressiveness, it is natural to think in termsof senla.ntic systenls with increasing functionalpower, l:urthel'more, a nat u ra.I wa.y of Cal)tu ringthis might be in terms of the type system whichthe gra.mmar efers to for its interl)retation.
Ithas been argued elsewhere (\[19, 20\]), that thereare reasons for describing how semantic systemsfall on a hierarchy of increasing expressive power.It seems clear at this point that the current enu-mera.tiw ~.techniques for lexical description are tooimpoverished to adequately describe the richnessof semantic da.ta, much less to explain either howword senses relate to one a.|tother or the creativeuse of wo,'ds i .

"John began cheese (catinq) / 1)ooks (read-ing).Namely, the homomorphic rela.tion between theNP type (mass vs. count) gives rise to i)rocessand transition interpretations of event structures(corresponding roughly to the amorl)hous andbounded readings resi)ectively, of (k)(lar(\[ andaayez's analysis).If it is truly an expla.na.tory and productive op-eration, coercion should be trot just a propertyof object phr~tses, but affecf the semantic inter--pretation of subjects and other positions a,s well(cf.
\[17\]).
For exan, ple, the interpretation o|'psychological predicates uch as ill (5) involvesa inetonymic reconstruction of the subject as a.ne.xperiencing event.

Ma.ry's ihce / her chatter / listening tol'V\[ary bores nle (cf.
\[7\]).Contrary to Godard and Ja.yez's claim, all ofthe above examples indicate very clearly a sub-ject event reaming; i.e., ~va(ling books, watchingthe movie, seeinq Mary's face, and listening toher chatter, as argued in \[J6\].
With examplessuch as *The book bcga'n last week, however, coere|on is not possible for ra.ther trivial reasons;nalnely, as a violation o1' control.
It is, by tileway, not surprising to lind asymmetries betweenargument positions.
Anaphora., control, and ex-traction from subject position all behave differ-ently from argument positions within VP.
Thepoint is that linguistic evidence supl)orts an un-derlying semantic type, directly explaining whatthe connection between the subject and object ofthe experiencing relation is.
in \[17}, the un(ler-lying semantics of psychological predicates uchas bore, anger, and frighten is a causative struelure where the surfa.ee subject is the logical ob-ject of an experiencing relation.
For example, theevent structure for the verb an.qcr has tire tbllow-ing form:\[PTxp(el,x,y) A ~\])(er,y) A ang'ry(e2, y) A~e.2-< q\] > cau,se(c'l,c2)The qualia structure projected by the NP cowtributes relational information as to just wha.tmanner of experiencing is inw)lved.
Short of gen-eral world knowledge, how are we to infer the 1)t~r -t itular ma.nmu' in which Mary became bored in(4b)?
By knowing what a. movie is, we know howto use it and experience it; this is the defining roleof tire quaJia structure.
And yet, to claim thatthe qualia are a useful representation (which C,o-dard a.nd Jayez admit),  withont exploiting themthrough type reconstruction operations (e.g.
coercion), is to fail to see the logical relations be~tWeell lexical senses a.nd derived senses in tile lan-guage.
It is as though we were to i)ermit tracesill our granuna.tical formalism without having a.statement of binding, or otherwise knowing whatto do with them.The third argu|nent aga.inst (:oercive opera.-tions involves exa.mples uch as a long novel anda bright bulb.
These.
are to be contrasted with ared book and a,i opaque bulb.
As pointed out in\[21\], the adjectives here modify a distinguishedevent predicate (i.e.
a quale) associated with tilehead, rcad for book, a~td ilh, min.atc tbr bulb.

".John hought a long novel.
"tha.t this is a. counterexample to type coercion.But this surely misinterprets what role the ad-jective is playing in tile semantics.
As alreadyargued very explicitly in \[22\], the modification byan adjective such as long, rclpide (J?tsl), or brillant(bright), is a submodification on the al)propriatequalia of the head.
