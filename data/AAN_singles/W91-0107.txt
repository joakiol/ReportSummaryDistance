SYNTACTIC CHOICE IN LANGUAGE GENERATIONrLee Fedder,University of Cambridge, Computer  Laboratory, Pembroke Street,Cambridge CB2 3QG, England.l f~uk.ac.cam.cl1 Abst rac tA considerable amount of study has recentlybeen concentrated on the use of linguisticallymotivated unification based grammars for sen-tence generation (see for example Appelt 1987,Calder 1989, Shieber 1988, Shieber et al 1989).The grammars state correspondences betweensemantic structures and syntactic ones.
Inmost grammars, several syntactic structureswill correspond to each semantic one.
It wassuggested at a fairly early stage that controlover which sentence is generated could be ap-plied by adding "functional" features to thegrammar.This idea has been extended in the workpresented here.
The use of feature threadingtechniques allows control over a wide rangeof syntactic structures, in a fairly sophisti-cated grammar, while avoiding the need forrule duplication even when generating un-bounded dependencies.
However, we will seethat the feature system required quickly be-comes complex, and: may be difficult to ex-tend to more comprehensive grammars.2 Introduct ion"A thematic system is one wherecorresponding members of the con-trasting terms normally have thesame propositional meaning, andthe same illocufionary potential.
"(Huddleston 1984:p437 ).Most phrase structure or categorial unifi-cation based grammars encode some form ofthematic system.
The simplest would involvethe inclusion of both active and passive voice.Typically, the grammar defines the syntacticstructure of each form, but does not includethe pragmatic information that distinguishesone from another.
When using such a gram-mar for parsing, this is not important, solong as the information is not required by thesystem using the parser's output.
However,there has recently been an upsurge in the useof these grammars for generation.
The lackof pragmatic data now becomes important:the generator is under-constrained, being ca-pable of producing any of the available the-matic forms.
One way of applying the neces-sary constraints, is to introduce a system of"functional" features into the feature struc-ture of the grammar itself.
These features areso called because they refer to the functionof the various parts of the sentence in a dis-course.
McKeown suggested the use of func-tional features for the TEXT system (McKe-own 1985) in which the grammar was basedon the FUG formalism (Kay 1979).
The func-tional features were defined as part of the ini-tial specification of the sentence, which wasthen filled out by traversing the grammar ina "Top Down" fashion.
For example, the fol-lowing was given by McKeown as an initialsentence specification.PROT =VERB =GOAL =TOP IC  =\[N === DOC\ ]\[V === BITE\]\ [TENSE === PAST\].\[ADJ === OLD\ ]\[N === MAN\]\ [PROT\]45The functional feature is "TOPIC",  andis specified as being the agent (or PROTago-nist) of the semantic structure.
The featurevalue controls wether an active or passive sen-tence will be produced.The work reported in this paper extendsthis technique to a grammar which encodes aricher thematic system than just active andpassive.
We use a unification based gram-mar with a phrase structure backbone, whichwas originally developed to provide a simplecomputational description of current linguis-tic theories (mainly GPSG, Gazdar 1985).
Asin the example above, a system of functionalfeatures is introduced.
A bottom-up genera-tion algorithm allows the production of sen-tences given an initial semantic form.
Theassignment of some initial values to the func-tional features constrains the structures gen-erated, and typically just one sentence willbe generated for each semantic input.This work was done in the context of adatabase nquiery system with single sentenceoutput.
We assume there is a discourse man-ager which initiates generation by passing thegenerator a "message".
This message con-sists of the propositional content of the out-put required, and some pragmatic informa-tion.The rest of this paper is in three mainparts.
The first is the definition of a co-herent set of discourse parameters that de-scribe the behaviour in discourse of the var-ious elements of a sentence.
The second sec-tion describes the thematic system used, andhow each member elates to the discourse pa-rameters.
Finally, we see how the grammarcan be augmented with functional features toprovide filtering during generation consistentwith the discourse parameters.3 D iscourse  Parameters'The members of the thematic system to bedescribed below behave differently in discourse.In the linguistics literature, there is a longtradition, of assigning labels to various clauseconstituents in order to describe this behaviour.Labels such as "given" and "new", "topic"and "comment" ,"theme" and "rheme" and so46on (a summary can be found in Quirk 1985,18.9).
We have adopted a set which allows adistinction between the members of the the-matic system we use.3.1 Speech  Act  TypeThis parameter conveys information aboutthe sentence as a whole.
Something similaris to be found in most grammars, but prece-dents in generation can be found in Appelt1985, and Bunt 1987.
Values are :-.2..Declarative - John gave a book to Maryyes-no question - Did John give a bookto Marywh-question - Which book did John giveto Mary3.2  ThemeThe theme is :-" .

So, whenit occurs in its expected or unmarked form,it will tend to be the first element of the sen-tence.3.3  FocusThe label "focus" has been widely used in thelinguistics and A.I.
to name a whole range ofconcepts.
We use the following definition :-"The focus .

indicates where thenew information lies" - Quirk 1985.This definition is easy to assimilate in termsof a database nquiry system where the newdata is easily identified.
As to where the fo-cus occurs in the sentencei"The neutral position of focus iswhat we may call END-FOCUS,that is (generally speaking) chiefprominence on the last open-classitem or proper noun in the clause"- Quirk 1985 '.There may be several elements in the gen-erator's input whitch are given, and severalwhich are new.
For simplicity, we assumethe discourse manager is able to specify oneas the most thematic, and one as the mostfocussed.3.4  Emphas isThe emphasis parameter indicates that somestress is to be laid on the indicated sentenceelement, above that supplied by an unmarkedsentence, as when correcting a false presup-position.
Emphasis is associated with par-ticular marked sentence constructions, as wewill see below.
Either the topic or the focusmay be emphasised: other sentence lementsmay not.4 Discourse parameters andthe thematic systemWe can now move on to see how the discourseparameters relate to the thematic system inthe grammar.
In general, guided by Quirk'sdefinitions, we have~ adopted the simple rulethat the theme is the first NP in the sentence,and the focus is the last.4.1 Act iveThe active sentence is considered as "unmarked"form in which the parameters adopt their de-fault or neutral values.
Thus the subject NPwill be the theme, and the focus will be on theverb, direct object, indirect object, or verbmodifier, whichever comes last.4.
John slept in the garden.
\[theme =John, focus = the garden\]4.2  Pass iveCreider (1979) classifies the passive as prin-cipally a topicalising structure, whilst Quirk47(1985) discusses the focussing effect.We have modeled these effects as follows.With transitive verbs, the subject is focusedand the object becomes theme.
If the subjectis omitted, the verb itself can be focused, butin addition, this produces ome emphasis.
Ifthe subject is not omitted, the verb can stillbe focussed and emphasised by fronting theobject, which then becomes the theme (seefronting).
Modifiers may take the emphasis.5.
Mary was loved by Jim.
\[theme = Mary,focus = Jim\]For bi-transitive verbs, the direct or indi-rect object can be thematised.6.
Mary was sold a book by Jim.
\[theme= Mary, focus = Jim\]4.3 The  ind i rec t  ob jec t  t rans forma-t ionCreider (1979) classifies this transformationas having a thematising function.Q.
What did you give to George?A.
I gave George a pennywhistle.A.
?I gave a pennywhistle to George.This is modeled by transferring theme tothe indirect object, and focus to the directobject.7.
I gave George a pennywhistle.
\[theme= George, focus = a pennywhistle\]The transformation can be combined withclass II passivisation.
The result is treated asa passive :-8.
A book was given by John to Mary.\[theme = a book, focus = Mary\]4.4 F ront ingThis construction is generally accepted as es:tablishing the theme (see Creider 1979 - hecalls theme "topic", and fronting "topicali-sation").
The fronted item is not new data,and seems to be associated with some formof contrast.
This shows up in examples like9.
John I like, but Mary I hate.This is modeled by assigning both the"theme" and "emphasis" parameters to thefronted item, the focus being at the end ofthe sentence as usual.10.
To Mary John gave a book.
\[theme= Mary, focus = a book, emphasis =Mary\]4.5 C le f tsThese constructions introduce the cleffed el-ement as new data, and apply special empha-sis, as when correcting a presupposition :-Q : Was it John who robbed thebank?A : No, it was ArtherUsually, the other entities in the sentenceare given, and uncontested.
As we saw in thedescription of the grammar above, any NP ormodifier in as sentence can be clefted.
So, theclefted item is in focus, and the theme nowmoves to the end of the sentence.11.
It was to Mary that John gave a book.\[theme = a book, focus = Mary, em-phasis = Mary\]4.6 In tonat ionThe intonational centre is assumed to be atthe end of the phrase, except in cleft forms,where it falls at the end of the first clause.If the theme or focus is realised as a relativeclause, the intonational centre comes at theend of that clause.
These are important as-sumptions ince non-standard intonation canserve to shift the emphasis or focus to almostany part of a sentence.5 The Grammar FormalismThe grammar isencoded in a framework builtas part of the Alvey natural anguage toolsproject, and known as the GDE (GrammarDevelopment Environment).
The syntacticanalyses are based on those developed by Pul-man 1987, with extensions to cover all the48thematic forms mentioned in the last section.They are couched within a simple unification-enriched phrase structure formalism.
Seman-tic rules are associated with the syntactic ruleson a rule-to-rule basis.
The semantic rulesare instructions for building logical forms ofa typed higher order logic.
The semantictranslation of an expression is assembled us-ing function application and composition, andby using beta-reduction.
The logical formsthe rules built are a type of "intensionlessMontague", similar to PTQ (Dowty 1981),but without the intension and extension op-erators.
Here, we are only interested in thesyntactic part of the rules, so the semanticscan be omitted.
The following rules couchedin GDE notation will serve as an illustrationR1.R2.S\[type decl\] ~ NP\[agr @x\] VP\[agr @x\]NP\[agr ~a\]Det\[agr @a\] Nbar\[agr @a\]R3.
Nbar\[agr @x\] ~ N\[agr @x\]R4.
VP\[agr @a\] ~ V\[agr @a, subcat np\] NPHere, the prefix "@" denotes a variable.NP's are type rMsed.
Syntactic ategories,subcategorisation, a d unbounded dependen-cies, are treated similarly to GPSG (Gaz-dar 1985).
Topicalisation, cleft forms, andrelatives are all treated as problems of un-bounded ependency, using gap threading tech-niques.
The tricky problems of passives anddative shift are covered by a version of theneat treatment presented in Pulman 1987.This involves the construction of passive anddative shifted versions of verbs, before inclu-sion in the rules which combine them withnoun phrases, such as R4.
No special struc-ture rules for passives are needed.6 The generat ion algor i thmThe current GDE generation system uses achart based bottom-up grammar traversal al-gorithm, similar to that described in Shieber1988).The starting point for generation is a log-ical form involving symbols which represententities in the discourse model of the applica- According to the description of the the-tion program.
For example "LOVE(ENT1,ENT2)"matic system above, a plain active sentenceThe referring expressions for these entitiesare pre-generated and entered in the chart,along with all the lexical items compatiblewith the rest of the logical form.During generation, chart entries are re-peatedly combined into larger constituentsvia the grammar rules.
A semantic filter blocksany constituents whose semantic formulae areincompatible w i th the  goal logical form.t7 How the :d i scourse  param-e ters  are encoded in thegrammarSo, how can the discourse parameters be em-bodied in in the feature system of the gram-mar.The speech ac t type of the sentence is in-troduced at the sentence level using the fea-tures "sentence-type" and "wh".
Assignmentsare as follows :-Declarative S\ [ type decl\]Question - S\[type quest, wh - \]WH-Question - S\[type quest, wh +\]The other parameters, theme, focus, andemphasis, are conflected with entities in theapplication program's discourse model.
Forgeneration, they are added to the initial chartentries for those entities.
Assume, to be-gin with, that wehave a functional featurefor each discourse parameter, "thin", "foc"and "emp", which take the values + or -as appropriate.
Then, given the start logicalform above, assume ENT1 is pre-generatedas "John" and ENT2 as "Mary".
From thediscourse model, we discover that ENT1 is tobe the theme, ENT2 the focus, and that nei-ther is to receive emphasis.
This gives us aninitial chart with the following entries for thereferring expressions :-John:NP\[thm +,foc - ,emp -\]Mary:NP\[tllm -, foc +,emp -\]would be suitable.12.
John loves MaryWe could constrain the generator to pro-duce just the active form by augmenting thegrammar ules as follows (irrelevant featureswill be omitted from the rules; altered rulesretain their original numbers, augmented witha,b,c ... and so on) :-Rla S ~ NP\[thm +,foc -,emp -\] VP.R4a VP =>V\[foc -,emp -\]NP\[thm -,foc +,emp -\].Functional features on the verb will be in-cluded for completeness, butare not actuallyused in the current system.Here, the NP of R4a is assumed tobe thelast constituent in the sentence.
Our treat-ment of passives means that hese rules wouldgenerate passive sentences correctly as well,since there is no separate passive transfor-nlation rule.
Rules for intransitive and bi-transitive verbs could be handled in the sameway.
However, the system breaks down whenwe introduce VP modifiers.
Now, we no longerknow which NP will be last until the VPhas been incorporated into a sentence.
Thiscan be handled by making the focus value ofthe NP dependent on a similar feature in themother VP, as follows :-Rlb S =>NP\[thm +,foc -,emp -\] VP\[foc +1R4b VP\[foc @f\]V\[foc -\] NP\[thm -,foc @f, emp -\]R5 VP\[foc @fl ~ VP\[foc -1VPMOD\[thm - ,  foc @f, emp -\]This, however, only works if there are nogaps.If the NP of rule R4b were a gap, andthere were no modifiers, the V would thencarry the focus.
This can be handled by thread-ing the focus feature through the NP.
If theNP turns out to be a trace (that is, the cre-ation of a gap), the focus value is threadedthrough to the V, but if it is a real NP, itkeeps the focus value for itself, and passes49the value "foc - "  to the V. The "foe" feature R0ais now replaced by "fin" and "fout" features.This allows a gap in the VPMOD as well.
If Rldthere is a fronted NP, the theme shifts to it,from the subject NP.
This can be accountedfor by linking the value of "thin" to the sen- R2btence.
If a fronted element akes the theme,this is set to - ,  otherwise it is set to + .
Be-low, the topicalisation rule assigns + to the R4dthm of the fronted NP, and - to the thmof the subsequent sentence.
The thematisedNP receives emphasis as well.
Transitive orbitransitive verbs which ends up as the focusalso receives emphasis.
So, we also link the R5bemp value of such a verb to its "fout" value.K0 SFIN ~ S\[thm +\] ; Top levelRlc S\[thm @t\] ~ R6bNP\[thm @t,fin - ,emp - \ ]  VP\[fin +\]R2a NP\[thm @t, fin @fi, fout - ,  emp @e\] ~ R7bDet NbarR4c VP\[fin @fi\] =~.

In thisconstruction, the theme isshifted from thefront of the sentence to the end, and the fo-cus shifts to the clefted element, which is alsoROb emphasised.
In response to this, we need tointroduce a "shifted theme" feature, "sthm", Rleand link the fin feature up to the sentencecategory.
Once shifted, the theme needs tobe treated just like the focus - landing at theend of the sentence.
That means it needs R4ethreading, and we replace thm with the fea-tures "tin" and "tout".
Treatment of clefting,then, causes the following alterations :-50SFIN ~ S\[tin +,fin +\]S\[tin @t,sthm @s,fin @f\]NP\[tin @t,fin - ,emp- \ ]  VP\[tin @s,fin@f\]NP\[tout - ,  fout - ,  emp @e\] :=~ DetNbarVP\[tin @ti,fin @fi\]V\[tin @to,fin @fo,emp -\]NP\[tin @ti, tout @to, fin @fi, fout @fo,emp -\]VP\[tin @ti,fin @fi\] =~VP\[tin @to,fin @fo\]VPMOD\[tin @to,tout @to,fin @fi,fout@fo,emp - \ ]NP\[tin @t, tout @t, fin @f, fout @f, emp- \ ]  =v \[\] ; trace NPS ~ NP\[tin +,fin - ,emp +\ ]S\[tin - ,s thm -,fin +\]S ~ Pro Aux NP\[tin -,f in +,emp +\]S\[type tel,tin - , s thm +,fin - \]; Clefting ruleFinally, for dative movement, focus staysat the end of the sentence, (unless a cleft fromis used) but the theme moves to the indirectobject.
This can happen if the theme has al-ready been shifted by a cleft, or if it hasn't.This is treated by introducing one final fea-ture "normal shifted theme" or "nst".
Thisfeature is set to - if there is a dative shift,and + otherwise.
Then, wherever tin usedto be set to +, it is now takes its value fromthe nst feature.
The exception is topicalisa-tion, when dative movement is prevented bysetting nst to - .
The rules changes that im-plement his are as follows :-SFIN ~ S\[tin @d,nst @d,fin +\]S\[tin @t,sthm @s,nstNP\[tin @t,fin - ,empVP\[tin @s,nst @d,fin@d,fin @f\]-\]@f\]VP\[tin @ti,nst +,fin @fi\]V\[tin @to,fin @fo,emp - \ ]NP\[tin @ti, tout @to, fin @fi, fout @fo,emp -\]R5cR7bR8aR9aRiOVP\[tin @ti,nst @d,fin @fi\] =~VP\[tin @to,nst @d,fin @fo\]VPMOD\[tin @to,tout @to,fin @fi,fout~fo,emp -\]S ~ NP\[tin ++,fin - ,emp +\]S\[tin - ,sthm -,nst +,fin +\]VP\[tin @ti,nst +,fin @fi\]~V\[tin @tol,fin @fol,emp fol\]NP\[tin ~to, tout ~tol,fin @fo, lout ~fl,emp - \]PP\[tin @ti, tout @to, fin @fi,fout @fo,emp-\]  ; threading as normalS ~ Pro AuX NP\[tin -,fin +,emp +\]S\[type rel,tin:-,sthm @d,nst @d,fin - \]; Clefting ruleVP\[tin +,tout - ,nst -,fin ~fi\]V\[tin -,fin @fol,emp fol\]NP\[tin +,fin @fo, lout @fl, emp - \]NP\[tin-,fin @fi,fout @fo,emp , \ ]  ; da-tive movement7.1 In i t ia l  feature  valuesAn NP now carries five functional features, asopposed to the three we assumed at the start.They are initially set as follows.
If the entityis theme, we have \[tin +,tout -\].
If the entityis focus, we have fin +, four -\].
Otherwise,theme and focus values are threaded, as in\[tin @t, tout @t, fin:@f, lout @f\].8 A Simple ExampleLet the message be :-LF-  LOVE(ENT1,ENT2)Speech-Act-Type - DeclarativeTheme- ENT1Focus - ENT2ENT1 is pre-generated as the NP "John"and ENT2 as "Mary!
', and this gives the fol-lowing initial chart entries :-C1.
John:NP\[tin +, tout -,fin @f, lout @f, emp-\]53.C2.
Mary:NP\[tin @t, tout ~t,fin +, fout - ,  emp-\]C3.
loves:VC3 represents the entries in the lexiconwhich are compatible with the initial logicalform.From this position, C2 and C3 can becombined via rule R4e to give the new chartentry :-C4 loves Mary:VP\[tin @t, nst +, fin +\]Then, C1 and C4 can be combined viarule le to give :-C5 John loves Mary:S\[type decl, tin +, nst+, fin +\]Other sentence forms are blocked by thefunctional features.
If the NP "Mary" wereoriginally assigned "emp +", the generationwould only be able to succeed by using thecleft form "It was Mary who was loved byJohn".
If "John" were emphasised, genera-tion would fail: the current system has noway of emphasising a thematised agent.
Itwould be necessary to use a different verb, oruse prosodic stress.
Neither of these methodsis available in the current system.9 DiscussionThe functional feature system is clearly be-coming rather complex, a problem which willonly increase with the inclusion of more elab-orate thematic forms.
Further esearch wouldshow if this becomes completely unmanagable.A possible solution to this problem is dis-cussed in McKeown 1987 in which pragmaticconstraints are added to a FUG grammer.They show how the constraints can be statedin one place, rather than duplicated through-out the feature system.Certain combinations ofinitial feature as-signments cause failure to generate.
In thesecases, some form of constraints relaxation willbe necessary.10 Conc lus ionsThe addition of "functional" features to aunification grammar is used to provide con-trol of syntactic variants during generation.The use of threading avoids the need for du-plication of rules, whilst allowing afairly widerange of thematic variants.
However, the fea-ture system required quickly becomes com-plex.11 AcknowledgementsThis work was made possible by funding fromthe Science and Engineering Research Coun-cil, and Logica U.K.
