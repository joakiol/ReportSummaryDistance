It is subsequentlyshown in what way bracketed grid theorydiffers from metrical theories using trees.Finally, we show that there are no sig-nificant differences between the formalismof bracketed grids (for metrical structure)and the representation used in the work of\[Kaye, et al, 1985\], \[1990\] for subsyllabicstructure.1 IntroductionThe most well-known characteristic of Non-linearPhonology is that it shifted its attention from thetheory of rules (like in \[Chomsky and Halle, 1968\]) tothe theory of representations.
During the last decadephonologists have developed a theory of representa-tions that is sufficiently rich and adequate to describea wide range of facts from the phonologies of variouslanguages.It is a fairly recent development that these repre-sentations are being studied also from a purely for-mal point of view.
There has been done some workon autosegmental structure (for instance \[Colemanand Local, 1991; Bird, 1990; Bird and Klein, 1990\])and also some work on metrical trees (like \[Coleman,1990; Coleman, 1992\] in unification phonology and\[Wheeler, 1981; Moortgat and Morrill, 1991\] in cat-egorial ogics).
As far as I know, apart from the pio-neering work by \[Halle and Vergnaud, 1987\], hithertono attention has been paid to the formal aspects ofthe most popular framework of metrical phonolog~ynowadays, the bracketed grids framework.Yet a lot of questions have to be answered withregard to bracketed grids.
First of all, some authors(for instance \[Van der Hulst, 1991\]) have expressedthe intuition that bracketed grids and tree structures(e.g.
the \[sw\] labeled trees of \[Hayes, 1981\] and re-lated work) are equivalent.
In this paper, I studythis intuition in some formal detail and show that itis wrong.Secondly, one can wonder what the exact rela-tion is between higher-order metrical structure (foot,word) and subsyllabic structure.
In this paper I willshow that apart from a fewempirically unimportantdetails, bracketed grids are equivalent to the kind ofsubsyllabic structure that is advocated by \[Kaye, etal., 1985\], \[1990\] t.2 The definition of a bracketed gridBelow I give a formal definition of the bracketed grid,as it is introduced by HV and subsequently elabo-rated and revised by these authors and others, mostnotably \[Hayes, 1991\].
HV have a major part of theirbook devoted to the formalism themselves, but thereare numerous problems with this formalization.
Iwill mention two of them.First, their formalization is not flexible enough tocapture all instances of (bracketed) grid theory asit is actually used in the literature of the last fewyears.
They merely give a sketch of the specific im-plementation of bracketed grid theory as it is usedin the rest of their book.
Modern work like \[Kager,1989\] or \[Hayes, 1991\] cannot be described within1In this paper, I will use HV as an abbreviation for\[Halle and Vergnaud, 1987\] and KLV as an abbreviationfor \[Kaye, et al, 19851, \[1990\].322this framework.Secondly, their way of formalizing bracketing ridshas very much a 'derivational' flavour.
They aremore interested in how grids can be built than inwhat they look like.
Although looking at the deriva-tional aspects is an interesting and worthwile enter-prise in itself, it makes their formalism less suitablefor a comparison with metrical trees.A grid in the linguistic literature is a set of lines,each line defining a certain subgroup of the stressbearing elements.
Thus, in 1 (HV's (85)), the as-terisks ('stars') on line 0 represent the syllables ofthe word formaldehyde, the stars on line 1 secondarystress and line 2 represents the syllable with primarystress:(1) (.
*) line 2(*) (* .)
(*) line 1for mal de hydeWe can formalize the underlying notion of a line asfollows:Def in i t ion  1 (L ine)  A line Liis a pair < At, -'4i>where Ai = {a~,.

Vow, 13 ELi : a -4i 13 ::~ -'(13 "~i a) (asymmetry)c. Va G Li : ~(a -41 a) Orreflezivity)We say that Li C Lj if Ai C A#, a EL i  if a E At.Other set theoretic expressions are extended in a like-wise fashion.Yet this formalisation is not complete for bracketedgrids.
It has to be supplemented by a theory aboutthe brackets that appear on each line, i.e.
by a the-ory of constituency and by a theory of what exactlycounts as a star on a given line.We have exactly one dot on top of each column ofstars2.Moreover, each constituent on a line has onestar in it plus zero, one or more dots.
The starsare heads.
HV say that these heads govern theircomplements.
This government relation can only bea relation which is defined in terms of precedence.Suppose we make this government relation into theprimitive notion instead of the constituent.
A metri-cal line is defined as a line plus a government relationon that line:Def in i t ion  2 (Met r i ca l  l ine) A metrical lineML i  is a pair <L i ,P~>,  whereLi is a lineRi is a relation on Li and an element of {-~i,>-i,--,i, ~-'i, '~ i}ZThat is, if we follow the current radition rather thanHV.With the following definitions holding3:Def in i t ion  3 (P recedence  Re la t ions)  a Ni 13 ?~We assume that something like Government Require-ment 1 holds, just as it is assumed in HV that everyelement is in a constituent, modulo extrametricality(which we will ignore here).Government  Requ i rement  1 (to be revised be-low) A line Limeets the government requirement iffall dots on Li are governed, i.e.
a star is in relationRi to them.Now a constituent can be defined as the domain thatincludes a star, plus all the dots that are governedby this star.
We have to be a little bit careful here,because we want to make sure that there is only onestar in each constituent.In a structure like the following we do not wantto say that the appointed dot is governed by thefirst star.
It is governed by the second star, which isnearer to it:(2) * .
.
.
* .
.
.TIn order to ensure this, we adopt an idea from mod-ern GB syntax, viz.
Minimality, which informallysays that an element is only governed by another el-ement if there is no closer governor.
The definitionof Phonological Minimality could look as follows:Def in i t ion  4 (phono log ica l  government )  aG i#(a governs 13 on line i) iff a is a star andart13 A -~37, 7 a star : \[7R/13 A aR/7\]We will give the formal definition of a star later onin this chapter.
The government requirement is nowto be slightly modified.Government  Requ i rement  2 to be revised belowA line Limeets the government requirement iff alldots on Li are governed, i.e.
a star in Liis in relationGi to them.We can now formally define the notion of aconstituent 4.aActually, HV also use a fifth kind of constituent intheir book, viz.
one of the form (.
* .).
Because therehas been a lot of criticism in the literature against histype of government, I will not not discuss it here.4The reviewer of the abstract for EACL notices thatunder the present definitions it is not possible to ex-press the kind of ambiguity that is current in (parts of)bracketed grid literature, where it is not sharply definedwhether a dot is governed by the star to its left or by thestar to its right.
This is correct.
It is my present purposeto define a version of bracketed grids that comes closestto trees because only in this way we can see which are thereally essential differences between the two formalisms.323Def in i t ion 5 (Const i tuent )  A constituent on aline Li is a set, consisting of exactly one star S inLi plus all elements that are not stars but that aregoverned by S.We now have a satisfying definition of a metricalline.
We can define a grid as a collection of metricallines, plus an ordering relation on them:Def in i t ion 6 (Gr id)  A grid G is a pair < ?, 1>,where?
= {L1 .... , Ln}, where LI, ..., L ,  are metrical inesI is a total ordering on ?, such that VLi, Lj ?
?
:Li I L1 ?~ \[Li C Lj A Va,~3 ?
Li fl Lj : \[a -~i Z ?~8\]\]where C is intended to denote the proper subset re-lation, so Li C L 1 ~ ",(Li = Li).It is relatively easy to see that I by this definition istransitive, asymmetric and irreflexive.
We also definethe inverse operator T such that Li T L 1 iff Lj I L i .The most interesting part of definition 6 is ofcourse the 1 ('above')-relation.
Look at the grid in(3) (= HV's (77), p. 262):(3) line 3(.
.)
line 2(.
.)
(.)
line 1Ten ne seeEach of the lines in this grid is shorter than the oneimmediately below it, in that it has fewer elements.This follows from elementary pretheoretical reason-ing.
Every stressed syllable is a syllable, every syl-lable with primary stress also has secondary stress.We expressed this in definition 6 by stating that ev-ery line is a subset of the lines below it.
By thisstatement we also expressed the idea that the ele-ments represented on the higher line are in fact thesame things as those represented on the lower lines,not just features connected of these.
The second partof the definition says that the relative ordering of theelements in each line is the same as that on the otherlines.Our present definition of a metrical grid alreadyhas some nice properties.
For example, the Continu-ous Column Constraint, which plays a crucial role asan independent s ipulation in \[Hayes, 1991\] can bederived from definition 6 as a theorem:(4) Continuous Column Constraint (CCC): Agrid containing a column with a mark onlayer (=our metrical ine) n+l  and no markon layer n is ill-formed.
Phonological rulesare blocked when they would create such aconfiguration.The CCC excludes grids like (5), where b is presenton the third line, but not on the second.
(5) a ba c da b e dWe can formalize the CCC as a theorem in our sys-tem:Theorem 1 (CCC)VaVL iL j  : (a E Li AL i  \].eProof  of  theorem 1 Suppose a E Li, supposeLi I Lj.
Then (by (13)) L, C Lj.
Now the stan-dard definition of C implies VX : X EL i  -"* X E Lj.Instantiation of X by c~, our first assumption andModus Ponens give a E Li.OWe can also easily define the notion of a dot anda star, informally used in the above definitions ofgovernment.Def in i t ion 7 (S tar  and  dot )  1.

However, in our lin-guistic analyses we only consider finite construetions.We need to express this.
First, we define the notionsof a top line and a bottom line.
Then we say that afinite grid always has one of each.Def in i t ion 8 (Top l ine and  bot tom l ine) For acertain grid G, VLi E G(LToP, G = Li)d--efVLj E G : \[(Li = Lj) V (Li ~ Lj)\](LBoTTOM,G -" LI)~'~fVLj ?

G : \[L i =LBoTTOM,e\]Note that we have to say something special with re-gard to the government relation in LTOP, G. By defi-nition, this line has only dots in it, so it always looksas something like (6).
(6) .
.
.
.
.
.
.There can be no star on this level.
A star by defini-tion has to be present at some higher line and thereis no higher line above LTOP, G. This means thatthe LTOP, G can  never be meeting the government324requirement and that in turn means that no linguis-tic grid can ever meet the government requirement.In order to avoid this rather unfortunate situation,we have to slightly revise the definition of meetingthe government requirement for linguistic grids.Government  P~qu i rement  5 (for gr ids) - -  fi-nal version A grid G meets the government relationiff all the lines Li E G - {LTop, a} meet the govern-ment requirement.Def in i t ion 10 (L inguist ic  gr id) A linguistic gridis a finite grid which meets the government relationA last definition may be needed here.
If we look atthe grids that axe actually used in linguistic theory,it seems that there is always one line in which thereis just one element.
Furthermore, this line is the topline (the only line that could be above it would be anempty line, but that one doesn't seem to have anylinguistic significance).This observation is phrased in \[Hayes, 1991\] as fol-lows: if prominence relations are obligatorily definedon all levels, then no matter how many grid levelsthere are, there will be a topmost level with just onegrid mark.We can formalize this ~s follows:Def in i t ion 11 (Complete  l inguist ic grids)A linguistic grid G is called a complete linguisticgrid iff \[LToP, G\] = 1, i.e.
3a : \[a E LTOP, G A Vfl :L 8 e LTOP, G ::~ # ---- O~\]\]We call this type of grid complete because we can eas-ily construct a complete linguistic grid out of everylinguistic grid.If LTOP, G is non-empty, we construct a completegrid by projecting the rightmost (or alternatively theleftmost) element to a new line L/and by adding thegovernment requirement ~- (or -4) to LTOP, G. Fi-nally we add the relation Lil LTOP, G to the grid,i.e.
we make Lito the new LTOP, G.If the top line of the grid is empty, we removethis line from the grid and proceed as above.
Mostlinguistic grids that are known from the literature,are complete.Some authors impose even more restrictions ontheir grids.
I believe most of those claims can beexpressed in the formal language developed in thissection.
One example is \[Kager, 1989\], who claimsthat all phonological constituents are binary.
ThisBinary Constituency Hypothesis can be formulatedby replacing definition 2:Def in i t ion 12 A metrical line MLI is a pair <Li ,Ri>, whereLi is a lineRi is a relation on Li and an element of {~i ,  ~ i}3 Gr ids  and  t reesIn this section, we will try to see in how much brack-eted grids and trees are really different formal sys-terns, i.e.
to what extent one can say things in oneformalism that are impossible to state in the other.First recall the standard definition of a tree (wecite from \[Partee t al., 1990\])5:Def in i t ion 13 (Tree) A(constituent structure) tree is a mathematical con-figuration < N, Q, D, P, L >, whereN is a finite set, the set of nodesQ is a finite set, the set of labelsD is a weak partial order in N ?
N, the dominancerelationP is a strict partial order in N x N, the precedencerelationL is a function from N into Q, the labeling functionand such that the following conditions hold:(a) 3a E N : V/~ G N : \ [<a, /~>E O\] (Single rootcondition)(b) W,a  ~ N : \ [ (<~,~>~ PV <a,~>E P) ?

D)\] (Exclusivity condi-tion)(c) Va,~,7,6 : \[(< ot,/~ >E PA < a ,7  >E DA <8, 6 >E D) ~< 7, 6 >E P\] (Nontangling condi-tion)It is clear that bracketed grids and trees havestructures which cannot be compared immediately.Bracketed grids are pairs consisting of a set of com-plex objects (the lines) and one total ordering rela-tion defined on those objects (the above relation).Trees on the other hand are sets of simple objects(the nodes) with two relations defined on them (dom-inance and precedence).
These simply appear to betwo different algebra's where no isomorphism can bedefined.Yet if we decompose the algebraic structure of thelines, we see that there we have sets of simple objects(the elements of the line) plus two relations definedon them.
One of those relations ('~i) is a strict par-tial order, just like P. The other relation, Gi, vaguelyreminds us of dominance.Yet a line clearly is not a tree.
Although -4i hasthe right properties, it is not so sure that Gi does.While this relation clearly is asymmetric (because itis directional), it is not a partial order.First of all, it is not transitive.
(7) is a counterex-ample.

+--a b cHere aGib and bGie but not aGie, because of min-imality (there is a closer governor, viz.
b).
Gi also5For the moment, we will not consider Q and L, be-cause these are relatively unimportant for our presentaim and goal and there is nothing comparable to the la-beling function in our definition of bracketed grids.
Thisis to say that for now we will study unlabeled trees.
Noticehowever that the trees actually used in the phonologicalliterature do use st least a binary set of labels { s, w }325is irreflexive, of course, because no element is to theleft or to the right of itself.A more interesting relation emerges if we considerthe grid as a whole.
Because trees are finite struc-tures, we need to consider linguistic grids only.
Theline LBOTTOM,G has the property that VaVLI ~ G :\[a ~L i  =~ ~ ~ LBOTTOM,G\].
This follows from thedefinitions of LBOTTOM,G and of the 'above' rela-tion.This means that all basic elements of the grid arepresent on LBOTTOM,G and, as we have seen above,we can equal P to "~BOTTOM,G.
Furthermore, wecan build up a 'supergovernment' relation {7, whichwe define as the disjunction of all government rela-tions Gi in G.Def in i t ion  14 (Supergovernment ){70 d?__f U {<a, f~> laG~3Adot~(~)}LiEGAgain, we exclude the government relation of the twostars in (7).If we want to compare {7 to dominance, we have tomake sure it is a partial order.
However, {7 obviouslystill is irreflexive.
It also is intransitive.
Consider thefollowing grid for example.
(8) ?a cdIn this grid a{Tc A c{Td but --,a{Td.
For this reason, wetake the transitive and reflexive closure of {7, whichwe call 7"7?
{7.LFrom this, we can define the superline of a lin-guistic grid 6.Def in i t ion  15 (Super l ine)  The superline S/~ of alinguistic grid G is the tuple< ABOTTOM,G, "~BOTTOM,G, "Jf'T~{TG >.The superline is an entity which we can for-mally compare to a tree, with -~BOTTOM,G = P,ABOTTOM,G = N, 7"T~{7 = D. Of most interest arethe complete linguistic grids, firstly because these arethe ones that seem to have most applications in lin-guistc theory and secondly because the requirementthat they be complete (i.e.
their LTOP, G should haveexactly one element) mirrors the single root condi-tion on trees.
From now on, we will use the abbrevi-ation CLG for 'complete linguistic grid'.Note that we also restrict our attention to gridswhich meet the government requirement, i,e.
to lin-guistic grids.
We are not so sure that this restrictionis equally well supported by metrical theory as therestriction to completeness.
However, the restriction6The superfine itself has no specific status in linguistictheory.
I also do not claim it should have one.
Thesuperfine is a formal object we construct here becauseit is the substructure of the bracketed grid that comesclosest o a tree.to linguistic grids makes sure that all elements in thegrid participate in the government relation, becauseeverything ends as a star somewhere and hence hasto be governed by another element.In order to somewhat simplify our proofs below, weintroduce one new notational symbol here: ~.Def in i t ion  l6  (Top L ine)V~ E AVLi ~ G :\[c~Li ?~ c~ ~ Li A -,~Lj \[a ~ Lj A L~ ~ Li\]\]This symbol '_~' top line' denotes the highest line onwhich a certain element is present.
If a ~ Li, thenLiis the highest line at which a can be found.
Bydefinition, this means that ~ is a dot on Li.Of course, for every element in a linguistic gridthere is one specific top line.We now prove:Theorem 2 For every linguistic grid G, ifG is com-plete, then SLG satisfies the Single Root Condition.Proof  o f  theorem 2: Consider a complete linguis-tic grid G. We have to prove that 3a E A : V~ EA : \[< a,/3 >E "/-T~{TG\] (for shortness, we will referhere and in the following to ABOTTOM,G as A and to"~BOTTOM,G as "~ where no confusion arises).
Con-sider the (single) element of LTOP.a.
We call this el-ement 7 and prove that V/~ E A : I<7,/~>E TT~gG\].
(Reductio ad absurdum.)
Suppose 3/~ E A : \[<7,/~>~ TT~{Ta\].
Because this/~ is in A, 3Li : ~_ELi\].We now take the highest/3 for which this conditionis true, i.e.V~ E A : \ [<7,~>~ TT~{TG =~ 3Lk : \[~E_L~ALk T Li\]\]/~_ELI by definition means that there is no Lj higherthan Li of which/~ is a member.
But this in turnmeans that/3 is a dot on Li (or doti(/~)).Li cannot be equal to LTOP, G, because in that casewe would have/3 -- 7 and since 7"~{TGis reflexive,< 7,/3 >E TT~{TG, contrary to our assumption.
SoLTOP, G ~ LiBecause doti(/~) and the grid meets the govern-ment requirement 36 : \[stari A 6Gi7\].
From the defi-nition of supergovernment we then get that < 6,/~>ET ~{T G6 is a star on Li.
This means that 3Lm : \[6~Lm ALm ~ Li\].
We can conclude now that < 7,6 >ETT~{TG holds, because delta is on a higher line than/3 and we assumed /3 was the highest element forwhich this condition did not hold.But now we have < 6, fl >E q'T~{TaA < 3', 6 >ETT~{TG and because TT~{Tais transitive, < %/3 >E"/'7~{7G.
This is a contradiction with our initial as-sumption.
\[\]So superlines have one important characteristic oftrees.
Yet exclusivity and nontangling still do nothold for superlines of CLGs, even if they meet thegovernment requirement.A counter example to exclusivity is (9), where a -~bA <a,b>E TT~{TG.326(9) ?

Exclusivity andnontangling are meant o keep precedence and dom-ination apart.Sometimes in the literature on trees (e.g.
Samp-son 1975) we find some weakening of the definitionof a tree, in which exclusivity and nontangling arereplaced by the Single mother condition.We first define the mother elation, which is im-mediate dominance:Definit ion 17 (Mother)  -- to be revised belowFor all T, T a treeVa/9 ?

Because a # 7, we have a # /9.For if a =/9, we would have 7Ma A aM~9.
But by(19) we then cannot have 7M/9.
A similar line ofreasoning shows that/9 ~ 7.
So a ?
7 A 7 ?/9.
By(17) this means that \[< a,/9>6 ~GA < 7, ~ >6 Ca\],because 7ZQG is the transitive closure of GG.
Wehave reached the following proposition:Proposit ion 1 The mother elation equals ~ on su-perlines: V~/9 ?

Also, if < %/9 > ?

Becausecan by definition be a dot at exactly one line, Li=Ljand otGi/9 and 7Gi/9.
However, from the minimal-ity definition of government (4), it follows that inthat case (~ = 7.
Which is a contradiction.
\[\]4 Dependency TreesLet us summarize the results so far.
We have seenthat from bracketed grids we can extract sup?tithes,on which the government relations of the normal linesare conflated.These superlines are equivalent to some sort of un-labeled trees, under a very weak definition of the lat-ter notion.
Whereas the minimal restrictions of theSingle Root Condition and the Single Mother Condi-tion do hold, the same is not necessarily true for theExclusivity Condition and the Non-Tangling Condi-tion.It can be shown that in the linguistic literaturea form of tree occurs that is exactly isomorphic tobracketed grids.
These are the trees that are used inDependency Phonology.We did not yet discuss what the properties of thesetrees are.
This is what we will briefly do in thepresent section.First let us take a look at the kind of tree we canconstruct from a given grid.
We give the CLG in(11) as an example:(11) LTOP, G* b-e?/,From this grid we can derive a superline 8?awith {~G = {<a,b>,<c ,d>,<e, f>,<e,a>,<e, c >}.
If we interpret his as a dominance relationand if we draw dominance in the usual way, with thedominating element above the dominated one, we getthe following tree:(12) eb d fThis tree looks rather different than the structuresused in the syntactic literature or in metricM worklike \[Hayes, 1981\].Yet there is one type of structure known in thelinguistic (phonological) literature which graphicallystrongly resembles (12).
These are the DefendencyGraphs (DGs) of Dependency Phonology (\[Durand,1986\] a.o.
).According to \[Anderson and Durand, 1986\], DGshave the following structure.
They consist of a setof primitive objects together with two relations, de-pendency and precedence.
For example within thesyllable/set/the following relations are holding (no-tice some of the symbols we introduced above areused here with a slightly different interpretation):Dependency s ,--- e --* t (i.e.
/s /  depends on /e /and/ t /depends on ~el.327Precedence  s < e < t (i.e.
/ s /  bears a relationof 'immediate strict precedence to /e /wh ich ,  inturn, bears the same relation to / t / .Anderson and Durand also introduce the transi-tive closure of 'immediate strict precedence', 'strictprecedence', for which they use the symbol << andthe transitive closure of dependency, 'subordination',for which they use the double-headed arrow.
More-over, well-formed ependency graphs conform to thefollowing informal characterisation (=Anderson andDurand's (10)):Def in i t ion 20 (Dependency  graph)(---Anderson and Durand's (10))1.
There is a unique vertex or root2.
All other vertices are subordinate to the root3.
All other vertices terminate only one arc4.
No element can be the head of two different con-structions5.
No tangling of arcs or association lines is al-lowed20.1 and 20.2 together form a redefinition of theSingle Root Condition.
Theorem 2 states that su-perlines of CLGs with the government requirementsatisfy this Condition.Because 'arcs' are used as graphic representationsfor dependency (which is intransitive), 20.3 seems aformulation of the Single Mother Condition.
Theo-rem 3 states that this condition also holds for super-lines of complete linguistic grids.20.4 needs some further discussion because it isthe only requirement that does not seem to hold forour grids.
The condition says that something cannotbe a head at more than one level of representation,e.g.
something cannot be the head of a foot and ofa word.
However, because of the CCC, in bracketedgrid systems the head of a word always is present (asa star - hence as a head) on the foot level.It is exactly this requirement that is abandoned byall authors of at least Dependency Phonology.
\[An-derson and Durand, 1986\] (p.14) state that one el-ement can be the head of different constructions, asindeed we have already argued in presenting a givensyllabic as suecesively the head of a syllable, a footand a tone group.In order to represent his, a new type of relationis introduced in their system, subjunction.
A node ais subjoined to/3 iff (~ is dependent on/3 but there isno precedence relation between the two.The word intercede then gets the following repre-sentation:(13) oO Ob,,o o II Iin ter cedeWe once again cite \[Anderson and Durand, 1986\](p.15):The node of dependency degree 0 is ungoverned(the group head).
On the next level down, at de-pendency degree 1, we have two nodes governed bythe DDO node representing respectively the first foot(inter) and the second foot (cede).
The first nodeis adjoined to the DDO node, the second one is sub-joined.
Finally, on the bottom level, at DD2, thenodes represent the three syllables of which this wordis comprised.
These latter nodes are in turn governedby the nodes at DD1 and once again related to themby either adjunction or snbjunction.Lifting the restriction this way seems to be exactlywhat is needed to fit the superline into the DG for-malism.20.5 holds trivially in the bracketed grid frame-work as well.
It can be interpreted as: if ~ precedes/3 on a given line in the grid, there is no other linesuch that/3 precedes c~ on that line.
This is includedin the definition of the '~' relation,The difference between a phonological DG anda bracketed grid is the same as the difference be-tween a superline and a bracketed grid: the DG isnot formally divided into separate lines.
Interest-ingly, \[Ewen, 1986\] analyses English stress shift, oneof the main empirical motivations behind the gridformalism, with subjunction.
In \[Van Oostendorp,1992b\] I argue that using subjunction Ewen's wayactually means an introduction of lines into Depen-dency Phonology.5 Government  Phono logyNow let us turn over to a well-known phonologicaltheory that also employs the notion of governmentas well as 'autosegmental representations'.
I refer ofcourse to the syllable theory of KLV and \[Charette,1991\].This theory of the syllable in fact does not havea syllable constituent at all.
In stead of such a con-stituent, KLV postulate a line of x-slots and par-alelly, a tier of representation which conforms to thepattern (0  R)* - that is an arbitrary number of rep-etitions of the pattern OR.
(KLV \[1990\]) The term'tier' suggests an autosegmental r ther than a met-rical (bracketed grid) approach to syllable structure,but KLV are never explicit on this point.The fact that O and R appear in a strictly regularpattern can be explained either by invoking the (met-rical) Perfect Grid requirement or, alternatively, the328(autosegmental) OCP.
The same applies to the 'la-bels' O and R: we can define them autosegmentallyas the two values of a type 'syllabic onstituent' or in-directly as notational conventions for stars and dotson a 'syllable line', i.e.
we could have the followingrepresentations for KLV's (O R)* line:(14) a. tier:.\[type: syll.const; vMue: O; .
.
.
\ ]  \[type: syll.
coast;v~lue: R; .
.
.
\], etc.b.
line:*, etc.For (14b), we would have to show that the rhymesor nuclei project to some higher line.
We will returnto this below.We still cannot really decide between an autoseg-mental and a metrical approach.
If we look at morethan one single line, this situation changes.At first sight, it then seems very clear that KLV'ssyllables act as ARs, not as grids.
For instance, wecan have representations like (15) (from \[Charette,1991\]), with a floating Onset constituent:(15) Or t  O RI I IX X XI I Ia m 1This is a possible autosegmental chart, but nota possible grid (because the Complex Column Con-straint is violated by the word initial onset).
How-ever, empirical motivation for (15) is hard to find.
Asfar as I know, the structure of (15) is motivated onlyby the assumption that on the syllabic line we shouldfind (OR)* sequences rather than, say, (R)(OR)*.The same state of poor motivation does not hold,however, to the representation \[Charette, 1991\] as-signs to words with an 'h aspir6'7:(16) O RI IX X XI Ia ?As is well known, the two types of words behavevery differently, for example with regard to the def-inite article.
While words with a lexical represen-tation as in (16) behave like words starting with a'real', overt, onset, words with a representation like(15) behave markedly different:(17) a. le tapis-  *l' tapisb.
la hache - *l' hachec.
*la amie - l' amieIt seems that, while the empty onset of (15) isinvisible for all phonological processes, the same isnot true for the empty onset of (16).rI disregard the (irrelevant) syllabic status of the final\[?\] consonant.So there are two different 'empty onsets' in KLV'stheory s. Notice that the type of empty onset forwhich there is some empirical evidence is exactly theone where the (0  R) - x slot chart does behave likea grid (i.e.
where it does not violate the CCC).So whereas we have here a formal difference be-tween KLV's theory and grid theory, this has no realempirical repercussions.Another similarity is of course the notion 'govern-ment'.
For KLV, government only plays a role onthe line of x-slots.
\[Charette, 1991J(p. 27) gives thefollowing summary:Governing relations must have the following prop-erties:(i) Constituent government: the head is initial andgovernment is strictly local.
(it) Interconstituent government: the head is finaland government is strictly local.Government is subject to the following properties:(i) Only the head of a constituent may govern.
(il) Only the nuclear head may govern a constituenthead.The most important government relation is con-stituent government: his is the relation that definesthe phonological constituent.
Moreover, the 'prin-ciples' given by Charette are only introduced intothe theory to constrain interconstituent government.By definition, constituent government remains unaf-fected by these.
(As for (i), the definition of the no-tion constituent implies that it is only the head thatgoverns and (it) does not apply because we never findtwo constituent heads within one constituent).The two conditions on constituent government(that the head be initial and the governee adjacentto it) can be expressed in our formalisation of thegrid in a very simple way:Def in i t ion  21 Rx-stot =~'-"According to KLV, *-- is the only possible con-stituent government relation.
Other candidates like{---~, ~-,-~,,~} are explicitly rejected, so in fact wehave (with some redundancy):Def in i t ion  22 VLi : \ [R/E {~-)\] A R~-,lot =*'--8\[Piggot and Singh, 1985\] propose a different distinc-tion, namely one in which the empty onset of ami is rep-resented as (in) and the one of hache as (ib) (0 is a nullsegment):(i) a.
0 b.
0I IX XI0Under this interpretation of Government Phonology,the syllable structure is formally even more similar togrids, if we assume that the linking between segmentalmaterial and x-slots has to be outside the grid (treatedas autosegmental association) anyway.329This is one of the reasons why KLV do not acceptthe syllable as a constituent: under their definitionof government, his would make the onset into thehead of the syllabic constituent.At least we can see from these definitions that thex-slot line in KLV's theory behaves like a normalmetrical ine.Yet there is one extra condition defined on thisline; this is called interconstituent government.
Be-cause of the restrictions in (15), KLV notice that thistype of government only concerns the following con-texts.
(Square brackets denote domains for intercon-stituent government, normal brackets for constituentgovernment):(18) a. N OA I(x Ix) (x\]b. NONI I\[(x) (xlc.
0 RI IIx) (x\]But the fact that there is an extra condition on aline does not alter its being metrical, even if we callthis extra condition a government relation 9.We now have reached the following representation(20) of the grid variant of the x line in (19) (we usethe star-and-dot notation and leave out the associa-tion of the autosegmental material to the skeleton):(19) O R O RI IA iX X X X XI I I I Ip a t r l(20) O R O tt(*) (*) (* .)
(*)By definition, stars are present on a higher line.As we have seen above, there is no reason not toconsider the (O R)* tier to be this higher line.
Wethen get the following representation:(21) (.

*) line 2 (?
)(*) (*) (* .)
(*) line l (~)p a t r iAs we noted above, KLV do not accept any con-stituents on the higher line.
One of their reasons wastheir stipulation that all constituents are left-headed.There are independent reasons to abandon this re-striction.
\[Charette, 1991\] argues for a prosodic anal-ysis of French schwa/\[e\] alternations.
In order to dothis, she has to build metrical (Is w\] labeled) treesrepresenting feet on top of the nuclei.
She gives the9In \[Van Oostendorp, 1992a\] I sketch a way of trans-lating 'interconstituent government' to a bracketed gridtheory of the syllable.following crucial example \[Charette, 1991\] (p.180, ex-ample ( l lc)):(22) FW SI IN NI I0 N O NI I I IX X X XI I I Im ~ n eHere we have a clear case of a right-headed phono-logical constituent, namely the foot.Furthermore, we see that the nuclei are projectedfrom the (O R)* line to a i ine  where they are thesingle elements.
If we change the top N's in thispicture into ~'s we have something like a metricalsyllable line.If we incorporate these two innovations into ourtheory, we can translate th structure in 22 into aperfectly normal grid, in fact into a complete linguis-tic grid:(23) - head-of-foot (-- LTOP, G)(.

(*) x-nine(--)I I I Im O n eConcludingly, we can say that, although KLV'ssyllable representations are somewhat different fromlinguistic grids, two minor adjustments can makethem isomorphic:?
in stead of (O R)* we assume (R)(O R)*, i.e.there can be onsetless syllables (KLV themselvesnote that most of the (O R)* stipulation canbe made to follow from independent s ipulationslike interconstituent government).
This followsa forteriori for the (R)(O R)* stipulation.?
in stead of 22 we assume VR~ : \[R~ E {~--,}\] ^  R~_,~.
=*--The first conjunct of this definition is simplymy translation of Kager's (\[1989\]) Binary Con-stituency Hypothesis 12 and the second con-junct does the same as the original definition ofKLV: it gives the correct choice of governmentfor the subsyllabic line.As far as I can see, none of these modificationsalters the empirical scope of KLV's theory in anyimportant way.
I conclude that for all practical pur-poses, KLV's representation f the syllable equals mydefinition of a linguistic grid.6 Conc lus ionIn this paper we have seen that three more or lesspopular representational systems in modern phonol-ogy are notational variants of each other in most330important ways: these are bracketed grid theory,Dependency Phonology and Government Phonology.The basic ideas underlying each of these frameworksare government/dependency on the one hand and thedivision of a structure into lines on the other.The similarity between the frameworks i  obscuredmainly by the immense differences in notation; butwe have shown that the algebraic systems underlyingthese formalisms i basically the same.In \[Maxwell, 1992\] it is shown that the differencesbetween Dependency Graphs and X-bar structures asused in generative syntax are minimal.
It remains tobe shown whether there are any major formal differ-ences between the bracketed grids that are presentedin this paper and the 'X-bar-structures-cure-lines' asthey are represented in \[Levin, 1985\] and \[Hermans,1990\].AcknowledgementsI thank Chris Sijtsma, Craig Thiersch and Ben Her-marls and the anonymous EACL reviewer of the ab-stract for comments and discussion.
