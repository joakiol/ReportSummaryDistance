Our method depends on the assump-tion that it is possible to find a pivot lan-guage for a given language pair on con-dition that there are both a large transla-tion dictionary from the source languageto the pivot language, and a large transla-tion dictionary from the pivot language tothe destination language.
Experiments thatexpands the Indonesian-Japanese dictionaryusing the English language as a pivot lan-guage shows that the proposed method canimprove performance of a real CLIR system.1 IntroductionRich cross lingual resources including large trans-lation dictionaries are necessary in order to realizeworking cross-lingual NLP applications.
However,it is infeasible to build such resources for all lan-guage pairs, because there are many languages in theworld.
Actually, while rich resources are availablefor several popular language pairs like the Englishlanguage and the Japanese language, poor resourcesare only available for rest unfamiliar language pairs.In order to resolve this situation, automatic con-struction of translation dictionary is effective, but itis quite difficult as widely known.
We, therefore,concentrate on the task of expanding a small existingtranslation dictionary instead of it.
Let us considerthree dictionaries: a small seed dictionary whichconsists of headwords in the source language andtheir translations in the destination language, a largesource-pivot dictionarywhich consists of headwordsin the source language and their translations in thepivot language, and a large pivot-destination dictio-nary which consists of headwords in the pivot lan-guage and their translations in the destination lan-guage.
When these three dictionaries are given, ex-panding the seed dictionary is to translate words inthe source language that meets two conditions: (1)they are not contained in the seed dictionary, and (2)they can be translated to the destination languagetransitively referring both the source-pivot dictio-nary and the pivot-destination dictionary.Obviously, this task depends on two assumptions:(a) the existence of the small seed dictionary, and(b) the existence of the pivot language which meetsthe condition that there are both a large source-pivot dictionary and a large pivot-destination dic-tionary.
Because of the first assumption, it is truethat this task cannot be applied to a brand-new lan-guage pair.
However, the number of such brand-new language pairs are decreasing while machine-readable language resources are increasing.
More-over, The second assumption is valid for many lan-guage pairs, when supposing the English languageas a pivot.
From these point of view, we think thatthe expansion task is more promising, although it de-pends more assumptions than the construction task.There are two different points among the expan-sion task and the construction task.
Previous re-searches of the construction task can be classifiedinto two groups.
The first group consists of re-searches to construct a new translation dictionary fora fresh language pair from existing translation dic-tionaries or other language resources (Tanaka andUmemura, 1994).
In the first group, information ofthe seed dictionary are not counted in them unlikethe expansion task, because it is assumed that thereis no seed dictionary for such fresh language pairs.The second group consists of researches to translate197xsv(xs) vt(xs)ys zs u(zs)Corpus inthe sourceSource-PivotDictionaryPivot-DestinationDictionaryCorpus inthe destinationSeedDictionarySelectoutputwordsFigure 1: Translation Procedurenovel words using both a large existing translationdictionary and other linguistic resources like hugeparallel corpora (Tonoike et al, 2005).
Because al-most of novel words are nouns, these researches fo-cus into the task of translating nouns.
In the expan-sion task, however, it is necessary to translate verbsand adjectives as well as nouns, because a seed dic-tionary will be so small that only basic words will becontained in it if the target language pair is unfamil-iar.
We will discuss about this topic in Section 3.2.The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-lows: Section 2 describes the method to expand asmall seed dictionary.
The experiments presented inSection 3 shows that the proposed method can im-prove performance of a real CLIR system.
This pa-per ends with concluding remarks in Section 4.2 Method of Expanding Seed DictionaryThe proposed method roughly consists of two stepsshown in Figure 1.
The first step is to generate a co-occurrence vector on the destination language cor-responding to an input word, using both the seeddictionary and a monolingual corpus in the sourcelanguage.
The second step is to list translation can-didates up, referring both the source-pivot dictionaryand the pivot-destination dictionary, and to calculatetheir co-occurrence vectors based on a monolingualcorpus in the destination.The seed dictionary is used to convert a co-occurrence vector in the source language into avector in the destination language.
In this paper,f(wi, wj) represents a co-occurrence frequency ofa word wi and a word wj for all languages.
A co-occurrence vector v(xs) of a word xs in the sourceis:v(xs) = (f(xs, x1), .
.
.
, f(xs, xn)), (1)where xi(i = 1, 2, .
.
.
, n) is a headword of theseed dictionary D. A co-occurrence vector v(xs),whose each element is corresponding to a word inthe source, is converted into a vector vt(xs), whoseeach element is corresponding to a word in the des-tination, referring the dictionary D:vt(xs) = (ft(xs, z1), .
.
.
, ft(xs, zm)), (2)where zj(j = 1, 2, .
.
.
,m) is a translation wordwhich appears in the dictionary D. The functionft(xs, zk), which assigns a co-occurrence degree be-tween a word xs and a word zj in the destinationbased on a co-occurrence vector of a word xs in thesource, is defined as follows:ft(xs, zj) =n?i=1f(xs, xi) ?
?
(xi, zj).
(3)where ?
(xi, zj) is equal to one when a word zj is in-cluded in a translation word set D(xi), which con-sists of translation words of a word xi, and zero oth-erwise.A set of description sentences Ys in the pivotare obtained referring the source-pivot dictionaryfor a word xs.
After that, a description sentenceys ?
Ys in the pivot is converted to a set of de-scription sentences Zs in the destination referringthe pivot-destination dictionary.

zls, which is an instance of Zs, is calculatedby this equation:u(zs) =( l?k=1f(zks , z1) , .
.
.
,l?k=1f(zks , zm))(4)Finally, the candidate zs which meets a certaincondition is selected as an output.
Two conditionsare examined in this paper: (1) selecting top-n can-didates from sorted ones according to each similarityscore, and (2) selecting candidates whose similarityscores are greater than a certain threshold.
In this pa-per, cosine distance s(vt(xs),u(zs)) between a vec-tor based on an input word xs and a vector based on198a candidate zs is used as the similarity score betweenthem.3 ExperimentsIn this section, we present the experiments of theproposed method that the Indonesian language, theEnglish language and the Japanese language areadopted as the source language, the pivot languageand the destination language respectively.3.1 Experimental DataThe proposed method depends on three translationdictionaries and two monolingual corpora as de-scribed in Section 2.Mainichi Newspaper Corpus (1993?1995), whichcontains 3.5M sentences consist of 140M words, isused as the Japanese corpus.
When measuring simi-larity between words using co-occurrence vectors, itis common that a corpus in the source language forthe similar domain to one of the corpus in the sourcelanguage is more suitable than one for a different do-main.
Unfortunately, because we could not find suchcorpus, the articles which were downloaded fromthe Indonesian Newspaper WEB sites1 are used asthe Indonesian corpus.
It contains 1.3M sentences,which are tokenized into 10M words.An online Indonesian-Japanese dictionary2 con-tains 10,172 headwords, however, only 6,577 head-words of them appear in the Indonesian corpus.
Wedivide them into two sets: the first set which con-sists of 6,077 entries is used as the seed dictionary,and the second set which consists of 500 entries isused to evaluate translation performance.
Moreover,an online Indonesian-English dictionary3, and anEnglish-Japanese dictionary(Michibata, 2002) arealso used as the source-pivot dictionary and thepivot-destination dictionary.3.2 Evaluation of Translation PerformanceAs described in Section 2, two conditions of select-ing output words among candidates are examined.Table 1 shows their performances and the baseline,1http://www.kompas.com/,http://www.tempointeraktif.com/2http://m1.ryu.titech.ac.jp/?indonesia/todai/dokumen/kamusjpina.pdf3http://nlp.aia.bppt.go.id/kebithat is the translation performance when all candi-dates are selected as output words.
It is revealed thatthe condition of selecting top-n candidates outper-forms the another condition and the baseline.
Themaximum F?=1 value of 52.5% is achieved whenselecting top-3 candidates as output words.Table 2 shows that the lexical distribution of head-words contained in the seed dictionary are quite sim-ilar to the lexical distribution of headwords con-tained in the source-pivot dictionary.
This obser-vation means that it is necessary to translate verbsand adjectives as well as nouns, when expanding thisseed dictionary.
Table 3 shows translation perfor-mances against nouns, verbs and adjectives, whenselecting top-3 candidates as output words.
The pro-posed method can be regarded likely because it iseffective to verbs and adjectives as well as to nouns,whereas the baseline precision of verbs is consider-ably lower than the others.3.3 CLIR Performance Improved byExpanded DictionaryIn this section, performance impact is presentedwhen the dictionary expanded by the proposedmethod is adopted to the real CLIR system proposedin (Purwarianti et al, 2007).NTCIR3 Web Retrieval Task(Eguchi et al, 2003)provides the evaluation dataset and defines the eval-uation metric.
The evaluation metric consists of fourMAP values: PC, PL, RC and RL.
They are cor-responding to assessment types respectively.
Thedataset consists 100GB Japanese WEB documentsand 47 queries of Japanese topics.
The Indonesianqueries, which are manually translated from them,are used as inputs of the experiment systems.
Thenumber of unique words which occur in the queriesis 301, and the number of unique words which arenot contained in the Indonesian-Japanese dictionaryis 106 (35%).
It is reduced to 78 (26%), while theexisting dictionary that contains 10,172 entries is ex-panded to the dictionary containing 20,457 entrieswith the proposed method.Table 4 shows the MAP values achieved by boththe baseline systems using the existing dictionaryand ones using the expanded dictionary.
The for-mer three systems use existing dictionaries, and thelatter three systems use the expanded one.
The 3rdsystem translates keywords transitively using both199Table 1: Comparison between Conditions of Selecting Output WordsSelecting top-n candidates Selecting plausible candidates Baselinen = 1 n = 2 n = 3 n = 5 n = 10 x = 0.1 x = 0.16 x = 0.2 x = 0.3Prec.

The 3rd system and the 6th sys-tem try to eliminate unnecessary translations basedstatistic measures calculated from retrieved docu-ments.
These measures are effective as shown in(Purwarianti et al, 2007), but, consume a high run-time computational cost to reduce enormous transla-tion candidates statistically.
It is revealed that CLIRsystems using the expanded dictionary outperformones using the existing dictionary without statisticfiltering.
And more, it shows that ones using the ex-panded dictionary without statistic filtering achievenear performance to the 3rd system without payinga high run-time computational cost.
Once it is paid,the 6th system achieves almost same score of the 3rdsystem.
These observation leads that we can con-clude that our proposed method to expand dictionaryis valuable to a real CLIR system.4 Concluding RemarksIn this paper, a novel method of expanding a smallexisting translation dictionary to a large translationdictionary using a pivot language is proposed.
Ourmethod uses information obtained from a small ex-isting translation dictionary from the source lan-guage to the destination language effectively.
Exper-iments that expands the Indonesian-Japanese dictio-nary using the English language as a pivot languageshows that the proposed method can improve perfor-mance of a real CLIR system.ReferencesKoji Eguchi, Keizo Oyama, Emi Ishida, Noriko Kando, , andKazuko Kuriyama.
