FrameNet has also beenand continues to be linked to other majorresources, including WordNet, BabelNet,and MASC, in the Linguistic Linked OpenData cloud.
Although so far the supportingtechnologies have not enabled easy andwidespread access to the envisioned mas-sive network of language resources, a con-flation of recent efforts suggests this maybe a reality in the not-too-distant future.FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2002; Ruppenhoferet al., 2006) is the ideal resource for representationin the Semantic Web (SW) as what is now widelyknown as ?linked data?.
The Semantic Web con-sists of objects whose properties are representedby named links to other objects that constitutetheir values and supports representing and reason-ing over ontologies defined the the SW frame-work.
FrameNet is also a complex semantic net-work linking lexical units to semantic frames, andsemantic frames to one another in a shallow hier-archy, over which inheritance and sub-frame re-lations are defined.
In sentences annotated forFrameNet frame elements, the role is a propertyof a frame object that is linked to the entity (ob-ject) that fills it; FrameNet also includes a hierar-chy of semantic types that constrain the possiblefillers for a given role.
FrameNet thus defines adense network of objects and properties supportedby ontological relations?exactly what the Seman-tic Web is intended to be.1The suitability of FrameNet for representationin the Semantic Web was recognized fairly earlyon in the development of the family of Semantic1For a fuller description of the structure of FrameNet data,see (Scheffczyk et al., 2008).Web formats, which include the Resource Defi-nition Framework (RDF) and the Web OntologyLanguage (OWL), which first became available asW3C standards in the late 90s and early 2000s.
Inone of the earliest projects to adapt linguistic re-sources to the Semantic Web, FrameNet was ren-dered in RDF and DAML+OIL (the precursor toOWL) in 2003, soon after these formats first be-came standardized, for the stated goal of providing?a potential resource to aid in the automatic iden-tification and disambiguation of word meaningson the semantic web?
(Narayanan et al., 2003a).Later, the DAML+OIL portion was converted toOWL (Scheffczyk et al., 2008; Scheffczyk et al.,2010).
Other conversions include (Coppola et al.,2009) and (Narayanan et al., 2003b); most re-cently, FrameNet was ported to RDF/OWL for in-clusion in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud2(Nuzzolese et al., 2011).
The possibility of link-ing WordNet and FrameNet in the Semantic Webhas also spawned efforts such as (Bryl et al., 2012)that build on numerous efforts over the past severalyears to align and/or extend these two resources(Burchardt et al., 2005; Ide, 2006; De Cao et al.,2008; de Melo et al., 2012; Bryl et al., 2012).
Oth-ers have analyzed FrameNet in order to formalizeits semantics so as to be appropriate for use withDescription Logic (DL) reasoners compatible withOWL-DL (Ovchinnikova et al., 2010).Given all of the activity surrounding FrameNetas a resource for the Semantic Web, one would ex-pect to see multiple examples of the use of Seman-tic Web implementations of FrameNet for NLP de-velopment and research.
However, these exam-ples do not exist, for two reasons.
The first isa reality of the Semantic Web: simply put, theSemantic Web has not yet come to fruition, de-spite its having been around as a concept for wellover a decade, and despite the development of asuite of W3C standard technologies to support it.2http://linkeddata.org18One of the most important of these technologies isSPARQL (Prud?hommeaux and Seaborne, 2008),a query language for data in RDF format, whichis the crucial tool for exploiting the inter-linkagesamong linguistic resources to support NLP.
Un-fortunately, SPARQL is new enough that it is notyet widely deployed and has not had the bene-fit of decades of optimization to improve its per-formance, which so far often suffers from slug-gishness.
The good news is that new researchand implementations are rapidly contributing tothe improvement of SPARQL and other SemanticWeb technologies, and as a result, we are seeingsigns that the requisite base infrastructure may be(or may soon be) in place to support acceleratedgrowth and deployment.At the same time, over the past four or five yearsseveral efforts in Semantic Web development?inparticular, the deployment of knowledge bases,lexicons, ontologies, and similar resources aslinked data?have made notable progress, includ-ing the LOD cloud and, of special interest forthe NLP community, its companion LinguisticLinked Open Data (LLOD) cloud (Chiarcos etal., 2012a).
Efforts to link, especially, lexical-semantic databases like FrameNet, WordNet, andBabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010) are under-way, although full, operational linkage may notbe immediate.
At the same time, however, thereis virtually no language data in the form of cor-pora in the LLOD, and none that contains annota-tions that can be linked to lexicons and knowledgebases.This suggests a second reason why FrameNet aslinked data has not yet been used in NLP research:a more useful configuration for a FrameNet-basedresource in the Semantic Web would include link-age from frame governors and frame elements to(many) examples in corpora, rather than a sim-ple rendering of linkages among lexical units,frames, and frame elements.
Coupled with linkageto WordNet and multilingual semantic resourcessuch as BabelNet (which has also been recentlyported to RDF?see (Navigli, 2012)), a SemanticWeb resource of this type and magnitude wouldenable SPARQL queries that collect informationacross several linguistic phenomena and levels, forexample, ?find all tokens in English and Russianthat refer to land as a political unit (synonymsfrom the WordNet synset land%1:15:02::) in theVICTIM role of the ATTACK frame?.
This is atrivial example; the full range of possibilities is leftto the reader?s imagination, and awaits SPARQL?stransition to full adulthood.FrameNet has always hand-annotated samplesentences as input to frame construction, due to theinsistence by FrameNet?s founder on groundingthe theory in real language data.
FrameNet?s earlyannotation efforts used examples from the BritishNational Corpus (BNC); however, as time wenton, FrameNet and similar annotation projects3found that usage examples extracted from theBNC were often unusable or misrepresentativefor developing templates to describe semantic ar-guments and the like, due to significant syntac-tic differences between British and American En-glish.
This motivated a proposal for an AmericanNational Corpus (ANC)4(Fillmore et al., 1998),comparable to the BNC but including genres non-existent at the time of BNC development (blogs,email, chat rooms, tweets, etc.)
as well as annota-tions beyond part-of-speech, to serve as basis forthe development of lexical-semantic resources andNLP research in general.5In 2006, the ANC, FrameNet, and WordNetprojects received a substantial grant from the U.S.National Science Foundation6to produce a half-million word Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus(MASC)7(Ide et al., 2010), consisting of datadrawn from the ANC and annotated for multipletypes of linguistic phenomena.
The project in-cluded a component to annotate portions of thecorpus for WordNet senses and FrameNet frameelements, in order to provide input to an effort toharmonize these two resources (Baker and Fell-baum, 2009).
The first full version of the cor-pus, released in 2012, included over 16 differentannotation types and was coupled with a separatesentence corpus (Passonneau et al., 2012) that in-cludes WordNet 3.1 sense-tags for approximately1000 occurrences of each of 114 words chosen bythe WordNet and FrameNet teams (ca.
114,000annotated occurrences).
Of these, 100 occurrencesof each word (over 1000 sentences) are also anno-3E.g., Comlex (http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/comlex/) and Nom-Lex (http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/nomlex/)4http://www.anc.org/5The ANC never received the substantial funding and textcontributions enjoyed by the BNC, and as a result has so farreleased only 22 million words of data, including a 15 millionword subset that is unrestricted for any use called the OpenANC?
(OANC), available at http://www.anc.org/data/oanc/.6NSF CRI 07089527http://www.anc.org/data/masc/19tated for FrameNet frame elements.
These annota-tions were subsequently used in a major WordNet-FrameNet alignment effort (de Melo et al., 2012).MASC provides a missing link in the SemanticWeb scenario for FrameNet and related resources.The corpus contains not only FrameNet and Word-Net annotations, but also annotations over partsor all the corpus at several other linguistic layersincluding morphosyntax, syntax (shallow parse,Penn Treebank annotation), semantics (named en-tities, opinion, PropBank), and discourse (corefer-ence, clause boundaries and nucleus/satellite rela-tions).
All of MASC is currently being incorpo-rated into the LLOD cloud, and its FrameNet andWordNet annotations will be linked to the linkeddata versions of those resources.8The resultingresource, connecting multiple major semantic re-sources and a broad-genre corpus, will be unpar-alleled as a foundation for NLP research and de-velopment.When the annotations for other phenomena inMASC are added into the mix, the potential tostudy and process language data across multiplelinguistic levels becomes even greater.
It is in-creasingly recognized that to perform human-likelanguage understanding, NLP systems will ulti-mately have to dynamically integrate informationfrom all linguistic levels as they process input,but despite this recognition most work in the fieldcontinues to focus on isolated phenomena or uti-lizes only selected phenomena from a few lin-guistic levels.
Some corpora with multiple anno-tation layers, including MASC and a (very few)others such as OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2007),have recently been created, but due to the highcosts of their development they are limited in sizeand do not include annotations across the gamutof linguistic phenomena.
Similarly, standardizedformats for annotated data (e.g., (ISO, 2012)),lexical-semantic resources (ISO, 2008), and ref-erence categories for linguistic annotations (MarcKemps-Snijders and Wright, 2008) have been de-veloped to enable merging of annotations of differ-ent types and formats, but there still remains con-siderable disparity among and/or lack of supportfor processing merged resources.8See (Chiarcos et al., 2012b) for a discussion of the pro-cess and benefits.
BabelNet annotations of MASC, which arein turn linked to wordnets in multiple languages, have alsobeen recently contributed (Moro et al., 2014), thus openingup the possibility for linkage from MASC to that resourceas well?and, by extension, linkage between BabelNet andMASC?s existing FrameNet and WordNet annotations.Is the Semantic Web the answer?
Will it be thevehicle for a paradigm shift in NLP research anddevelopment?
Likely, it or something it evolvesinto will ultimately provide the required commonrepresentation and processing framework which,coupled with potentially enormous advances incomputer and network speed, data capacity, neu-rotechnology, network-on-chip technologies, andthe like, will fundamentally change our approachto NLP in the decades to come.
In the meantime,it remains to be seen how quickly Semantic Webtechnology will progress, and how soon most orall language resources will reside in places like theLLOD cloud, so that they can begin to be fullyand readily exploited.
But whether the SemanticWeb as we know it now is the ultimate solution orsimply a developmental step, the direction seemsclear; and fittingly, FrameNet is one of the first re-sources on board.ReferencesCollin F. Baker and Christiane Fellbaum.
