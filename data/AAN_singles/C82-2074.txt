INTRODUCING COGITOLOGY?0 I ,  Z~onlnoOVPaou l ty  o f  Ph i lo lo~,  Mosoov Un ivers i ty ,  Moscow, USSRIn  the  course of  d i scern ib le  h i s to ry  i t  i s  not tood i f f i cu l t  to  t race  a number o f  events  when some d iscover iesor  invent ions  - techn ica l  by the i r  nature  - had an overa l land profound impact upon the human soc ie ty  in  .genera l .
Pro-bab ly ,  the most v iv id  example o f  such events  i s  the  invent iono f  wr i t ing .
An event  equal  in  scope and s ign i f i cance  has tobe conf ronted  by us today.
I t  i s  the making of  the  computer.Apprehension ot on ly  of  the techn ica l ,  but a l so  of  thesocial significance of its appearance was first expressed in1950 when the classical work of Alan Turing Computing Machin-ery and Intelli~enoe came out.
However, it is only at thepresent moment that we have come close to being able toapprec ia te  th i s  event adequate ly  and to  ac tua l ly  rea l i ze  theperspect ives  i t  has opened.
Now we have a l l  the  grounds tos ta te  that  w i th  the  ar r iva l  of  the computer and wi th  l c reat -ing  the programs which ensure i t s  funct ion ing ,  we move fromthe  epoch o f  p~vs ioa l ly  operat ing  machines in to  the epoch o fmachines operat ing  in te l l igent ly .
