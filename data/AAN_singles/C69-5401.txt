ELECTRICAL ANAIDGUES.
If ~ g~aph like (6) or (7) isconsidered to be aa e lec t r i ca l  diagram where oath word i s  subst i tu t~by a contact ,  and each arrow by an e lec t r i ca l  conductor (w i re ) ,  theresult is u electrical analogue of the grammar.
In this analogue ifome cIsses all comtee~8 correspomdlng to a semtemce, a contimuouselectrical path is established and the curremt flows from ome extre-mity to the other.
The detectiom of thim eurran@ is a proof of"grammaticality" for the word sequence under consideration.Electrical analogues can be designed also algebraically.
Forthis it is necessary to proceed ~S ~o//Q~/~from the list of sentences ~,  ~2, .... ~/~ 8tar t tngP L=U~J=l- replace each ~/ by its coW'responding rule of form (i),thatis- i o  -pj--I i=l- replace each~/and esch~iby  the corresponding rules oftype (1) ,and so on unt i l  the ~ lght  member of the formula conta insonly  the words o f  the vocabu lary .
Such a formula i s  (2) in  example 1'We have now at  our d i sposa l  a formula enumerating the ordered n-~p les  assoc ia ted  to a l l  sentences  o f  the language L.

GRAPHS OF TRANSIA TIONS~ This chapter and the followingare intended as su~ested applications of the above discussion, tothe understanding of the process of translatlon.
No attempt is ma@fto start from more rigorous definitions, 85 may be found for e~-pie in /6\] or \[7\] ?
Here the process of translation of a simplesentence from language L I , into language ~,  is regaz~led as consi%ring of the following operations sa) seek the given sentence in the d/ctionsry ~-~ |ib) if the whole sentence is found in the d/otionary, writee~down the translation found there and ~ the process |c) if tBe sentence is not found in the dictionary, divide itinto two subst~i~gs admitted by the gra-..sr (in fact, immediateconst i tuents )  !d) seek each of the substr/ngs in ~he dictionary |- 11  -e)  i f  one subst r lag  i s  found in  the  d ic t ionar~,  wr i te  downi t s  t rans la t ion  as  g iven  in  the  ~ct to .a r~ !f )  i f  one subst r ing  i s  not  found in  the  d ic t ionar~,  d iv ide  i taga in  in to  two fur ther  substr~ngs and  then  proceed aga in  as  ind icatedunder  d)  !6) the prooess stop~ when a strin6 is obtained which containsonly words belonging to the vocabulary of the language L2.A difficulty rises currently during the process of transla-tion, and th i s  i s  due to  the  fac t  that  many words ,  o r  s t r ings  com-posed  of more than one wo~d , admit two or mo~e translations.Suchis the case with homonyms.
Special subroutines have been developedto solve t~e problem of homonyms in digital translation of language.Suoh subroutines are based on successive step, of conditioned decisi~To quote only a few very simple examples, MARCUS , in \[8J ,gives ske~ohes of algorithms for translating into Roumanian "example" and"this "and for solving the homonymy of the French "pas" or ~he En-glish "this"?
The problem is related to that of sequential unde1~-s tand ing  of  s sentence ,  as  descr ibed  by  ZIEREH \[9\]  ?Le t  us  put  the  DEoblem somewhat d i f fe rent ly .
To choose  thewr i t s  word (o r  subst~i .~ between more than  one poss ib le  var iants ,we need some supp lementary  cond i t ion ,  o r  cond i t ions .
A f i r s t  andmost  impor tant  cond i t ion  i s  that  the  r ight  word (substT~g)  mustmatch  grammat ica l ly  the  o ther  words (subst~ings)  in  the  s t r ing .
Thatis to say that the right word (string) must form with another word~subet~iag) in the string an ordered pair belonging to a certain rela.tion accepted by the grammar of the language ~.
In the graphicalrepresentation suggested above, the right word (subst~,ng) mustfind itself on a continuous path with the other words (substr~gs)contained in the translation of the sentence under consideration,For example, let L I be the Englis~language and ~ theFrench.
Let the sentence in L I be "we see the bo~'.
It must be- 12  -d iv ided  in to  (we see)  ( the  boy).
Put t ing  s ide  by s ide  the cor rea -ponding par ts  of  the  Eng l i sh  and French graphs,  and marking by do~ted l ines  the mapping de f ined  in  the d ic t ionary ,  we can draw fo rthe first substr/ng the graphue\ we\IYno~' ~ \ *" vois1 \\1 ~ ~voyazs ~oiant IVOyOnBWe choose as t rans la t ion  only that  subst~hg that  c loses  our diagram.Sim/.larly, for the second substringthe:I q/I !/ !

Then a human translator,uses supplementary information,like general knowledge of the subject treated in the text, style usedetc.
Graphically, such information may be taken into account, forexample, by assigning different colours to different types of subjectThen the diagram must close through paths of different colour.- 13  -13 .
ELECTRICAL TRANSLATION.
Let us assume now that we haveat our disposal an electrical analogue N(L I) of the language ~,and an electrical analogue N(~)  of the language L 2.
We canfurther immaglne such an electrical connexion between the two ana-lo~-ues that when a contact "ai" closes in N(LI) ~ all contacts cor-responJding to the different possible translations of "ai" indica-ted by the dictionary ~-~2 are closed in N(L2).
Then, when a con-tinuous path of contacts is closed in N(L I) , its translation canbe only a continuous path resulted in N(L2).
For the selectionpf ~he type of subject or of the style used, we can devise a switchthat makes only the corresponding connections between N(L I) andN(~) ,  o r  in  N(~)  and  N(L 2)  themse lves .
Such a mwitch may have ,fo r  ex~np le ,  pos i t ions  marked ?

CONCLUDING R~ARKS.
What was suggested  under  13 and 1@are  in  fac t  examples  o f  cab led  log ic .
The imp lementat ion  of theseideas  fo r  an  ent i re  language may encounter  t remenduous  techn ica ldifficulties.
Designing graphs and electrical analogues for limitedparts of language may prove however useful for demonstrational pur-poses.
Thus it would be possible to achieve other models of languageunderstanding and translation than those provided by digital pro-grams and cunputers.
The author feels that this is indeed interes-ting, far as explained by ZIERE~ \[9~ ~ the process of understandingmust not be actually as divided into elementary steps as in an algo-x~thm -- "Dazu kommt noch dass beim Verstehen der gesprochenen Spra-che dutch den Menschen auch der soziale Kontext und das Erlebnis-verm~en des Menschen zum Abbau der angebotenen Information bei~gt.- 14  -Hier in  i s t  der, Computer dem Menschen unter le~en" .Another author ,  SAUVAN \[lo~ , d i souss ing  o ther  sub jec ts ,  be-l i eves  that  a Sequent ia l  computer cannot t reat  adequate ly  a combJ~atcr ia l  problem for  i t  has no poss ib i l i t i es  of g loba l  percept ions  "L 'au -teur  es t  persuad6 que lee  recherehes  do ivent  s 'o r ienter  vers  le~log iques  o~bl6es semblables aux structures e@~brales".- 15  -B IBL IOGRAPHYi.
