ukAbstractC, omi)utational ai)proaches to reference resolu-tion, like Centering Theory, are best at resolv-ing referring expressions which denote familiarreD.rents.
We demonstrate how, by t~king aproof-theoretic approach to reference resolutionwithin a Centering-type framework, we are ableto make sense of reti;rring expressions tbr un-familiar referents.
These include, in additionto bridging descriptions, definite descripl;ionslike "the first man" and "the first snowdrops ofSpring".
We claim that the first of these denotesa unique subset of a iflural discourse antecedent.While the second has no discourse antecedent,we similarly treat it as denoting a mfi(lue subsetof a t'~nniliar eferent.1.
I n t roduct ionItow do reti;rring exl)ressions denote?
Accord-ing to II.ussell, a definite description such as%he King of France", denotes a mfique individ-ual by virtue of its meaning.
But, according toFamiliarity Theory (Helm, 1.983), reti;rring ex-pressions need not denote mfiquely by virtue oftheir meaning as they refer to individuals madefamiliar by the discourse or other context.
Thisobservation plays a key role in Centering The-ory (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al, 1995)and other computational al)t)roaches in whichrethrring expressions are resolved by locatingtheir antecedents in the discourse.
The refer-ence of pronouns like "he", definite descriptionslike "the woman", and referential tenses like"had" clearly has more to do with salience illcontext thml with uniqueness of meaning.
Sim-ilarly, while names like "Mary" need not denoteindividuals prominent in the discourse context,* \Ve would like to thank the anonymous reviewers fortheir detailed and helpful comments.they must nevertheless denote individuals famil-iar to conversants if they are successflflly to re-fer.
However, there is another (:lass of referringexpressions in relation to which we believe theconcept of uniqueness of meaning does have anessential role to plt~y.
These include such def-inite descrit)tions as "the first man" and "thefirst snowdrop of Spring", along with such vari-ations on these as "the first three men" and "thefirst snowdrops of Spring".In implementing a system of retL, renee resolu-tion, we have attemt)ted to reconcile the notionsof familiarity mM uniqueness.
This enables usto dereli;rence xl)ressions like "the first snow-drop of Spring" in a unified framework alongsideanal)hers ~, pron(mns, retbrential tenses, names,and other definite descriptions like "the nlall".
(1) Two men nrrive(t.(2) The .fir.st 'm,a'H, spoke.In the case of a referring expression like "thefirst mini", there may be an antecedent of sortsin the discourse, trot it is not the individual re-ferred to (or indeed ml individual at all).
Wewill say that the antecedent "two men" intro-duces a set, and that the referring expression"the first man" denotes, by virtue of the mean-ing of.first, a unique subset of this familiar set.
(1) Mary saw th, e first snowd,vp ofSpring.In the case of "tile first snowdrop of Spring",there need be no explicit antecedent in the dis-course.
We will s~w that, in the same waythat "Mary" denotes a familiar individual, "thesnowdrops of Spring" denotes a t'~nniliar set, or>vVe use this term to distinguish reflexives like "her-self" from t)ronouns like "he" and "hiln".775property.
Again, by virtue of tile meaning offirst, "tile first snowdrop of Spring" can be saidto denote a unique subset of the familiar set.
Wewill not claim that it denotes a unique individ-ual, but that rather it denotes a unique subsetof the specified cardinality, i.e., 1.
This treat-ment has tile advantage that it extends to pluralreferring expressions.Below we outline the approach we have de-veloped to the representation a d resolution ofreferring expressions, betbre discussing in moredetail its extension to deal with unfamiliar ef-erents.2 A F ramework  for Re ferenceReso lu t ionOur framework for reference resolution has beenimplemented in the system of language under-standing described in (Ramsay, 1999).
Thestarting point tbr reference resolution is the log-ical tbrm we obtain fl'om parsing.
For example,the tbllowing is the logical tbrm we get for theutterance "Mary slept.
"~A : { A is interval $~f o,'e(,'e f ( aB ( V ech,_ti e( B , 1))), A ) }3C : {aspect(simple, A, C)}0 (C, agen.t, ref  (,kD (,,.amed(D, Mary)g card(D, 1))))sleep(C)C is eventWe use tile inference engine described in(Ramsay and Seville, 2000) to update the dis-course model with a new discourse state con-taining the intbrmation explicitly represented intile logical tbrm together with any further infer-ences which are licensed given the existing dis-course model.
Reference resolution, which in-volves carrying out a proof that a retbrring ex-pression denotes, is implemented as part of theupdate step.
We anchor a referring expressionlike ref()~D(named(D, Marg)&card(D, 1))) intile discourse model by proving the existence ofan entity in the model which satisfies the prop-erties specified by the referring expression, inthis case aD(na,~ed(D, Mary)~ea,'d(D, 1)) 2.2Strictly speaking, it is a set which is denoted.
Forreadability, our referring expressions conflate tim prop-erties of sets and their members.
In this case, the car-dinality is a property of the set denoted, but the nmneMary is a property of its member.Given that many referring expressions do not inthemselves denote uniquely, however, we needa theory of reference resolution to enable usto obtain the appropriate (i.e., intended) ret-erent for any referring expression.
We incorpo-rate our theory of reference resolution into theactual representation of referring expressions;for example, we label anaphors with the prop-erty "salient" and pronouns (and also referentialtenses) with the property "centred"3:"himself"re f ( AX (salient (X, re f ( AD ( eds (D)))$~m (X)))"she  ~,ref (),X (ee..tred(X, reZ (),D(e&(D)  )~Z(X) )Retbrence resolntion relies on maintaining, asin Centering Theory, a list of tbrward-lookingcentres for each discourse state (correspondingto an utterance) in the discourse.
Furthermore,for the purposes of reference resolution, the dis-course states themselves are organized into adiscourse tree, which is constructed automati-cally based on referential cues 4, as described in(Seville, 1999).0I1/ \2 3/1\456(1) a mani diedj in a park/~.
(2) hei hadj been sleeping ther%.
(3) a womanl lovedm him/.
(4) shez had,~ hated him/.
(5) he/ hadm hated himself/.
(6) he~: hadm loved herl.The nodes in such a tree correspond to dis-course states.
Those oll tile right-hand frontierare open, which essentially means that tile enti-ties mentioned in them are available to pronom-inal reference.The process of reference resolution for tilevarious referring expressions can be briefly de-scribed as tbllows.
Anaphors, characterised assalient, are resolved to a less oblique argumentof the same verb (Pollard and Sag, 1994) withinthe current discourse state, which is constructedaHere rcf(AD(cds(D)) is a reference to the currentdiscourse state and the properties m and f refer to maleand female gender espectively.4The tree illustrated was constructed using pronomi-nal cues.
Each discourse state was attached as a daugh-ter of the highest node in the discourse tree to which allpronouns and referential tenses (like had) mentioned init could be anchored.776incrementally.
We also st;art our sere'oh tbr thereferents of prononns and other centred enti-ties in the current disconrse state, which is nec-essary if we are to resolw; such referring ex-pressions as "her" in "Mary took John withher."
However, referring expressions contain-ing the property centred are prevented front1)eing dereferenced to salient entities, thus en-suring that the constraint of disjoint referenceis met.
If we fail to tind the centred en-tity in the current discourse state, we searchthe previous open node and, if necessary, fllr-ther open nodes in the discourse tree, in orderto deal with long-distance pronominalisation.The dereferencing of other referring expressionslike ref(AD(named(D, Mary)gcard(D, 1))) issimilar but less constrained in that we con-sider entities mentioned in all nodes mentionedin the discourse, tree, whether open or closed,in order of recency.
This means that, essen-tially, names and definite descriptions are deref-created to the most recently mentioned refer-ent which is appropriate.
Unlike in the case ofpronouns, we also consider Discourse State 0,which doesn't correspond to an utterance but,rather, contains the background knowledge as-stoned in the model.
This is how we are ableto deal with the first mention of a familiarreferent like Mary (assmning that the proper-ties kD(na, m(:d( D, Mary)gcard( D, 1)) sumceto distinguish a particular entity in Discourse,State 0 from all the others).Our approach extends naturally to cases like%he first snowdrop of Spring" because it; isproof-theoretic and so able to exploit back-ground knowledge in reference resolution.
Thiscan be illustrated, in the first instance., by exam-thing the backgrmmd knowledge which is usedin updating the utterance "Mary slept."
Theupdate step for this utterance yields DiscourseState 1, contailfing (amongst others) the tbllow-ing facts:Discourse State 1,s/eep(#134)0(#134, agent, #94)ends_before(#4(1), #133)aspect(simple, #13a, #134)We were able to prove named(#94, Mary)and card(#94, 1) and so dereferencercf(,\D(namcd(D, Mary)&card(D, 1))) asthe tbllowing were amongst he t~cts containedin Discourse State 0:Discourse State 0female(#94)named(#94, Mary)woman(#94)f(#.94)card(#94, 1)adult(#94)These were generated from the lexical memfing1)ostulates we stipulated for "Mary", "woman",and " fo lna le"  :3X (namcd( X, Mary)&woman( X)&card( X, 1))VX(woman(X)VX(.fcmalc(X) -4 f(X))3 Unfami l ia r  Re ferentsIn this section we show how, within the frame-work above, we are able to make sense of a vari-ety of referring expressions denoting unfamiliarreferents.
The most straighttbrward of these arebridging descriptions, so we start with these.3.1 Br idging Descr ip t ions(1) Mary loves her" moth, or.In this first case, "her mother", contains a refer-ring expression ested within it;.
Having deref-erenced this, the knowledge that moth, er of is afllnction enables us to obtain a unique reli;renl;.Our representation of the referring expressionto be derelbrenced is as follows:"her mother"ref(AB(of(B,,.e f ( a, 1)$~ f(G))))ca .d( B, 1)))Tile first step involves anchoring tile referringexpression by dereferencing its nested rethrringexpression for "her ''5.
'SThe referent for this is characterised assalient_or_centred as we allow I)ossessivc pronounsto be dereferenced as anal)hers or, failing that, aspronouns.777Current Modelends_at_or_after(#4(1), #135)aspect(simple, #135, #136)0(#136, agent, #94)Zove(#la6)Tile partially constructed current discoursestate we have when we do our dereferencing is asshown.
"Mary" has already been dereferencedto #94 and this has been entered into the listof forward-looking centres fbr the current utter-ance.
We are able to prove both salient(#94)and f (#94) ,  and so our nested referring expres-sion is dereibrenced to this entity.ref(kB(of(B,, F(,,,other( F) ),#94)card(m1)))It is then a straighttbrward matter to derefer-ence the anchored referring expression, giventhe tbllowing facts in Discourse State 0:Discourse State 0mother (#60 (#94))o f (#60(#94) ,  ;~A(moth.cr(A)), #94)f (#60(#94))card(#60(#94), 1These derive from our nmaning postulates fbr"mother ''6 and "of":VX( (X  is a,~i.,o,O~card(X , 1) --~~Y (o.f (Y, kZ (rnother( Z) ), X)&card(Y, l)&f(Y)))VXVYVZ(of(X, Y, Z) -+ Y.X)Dealing with other bridging descrit)tions ismore complicated:(1) Mary saw a house.
(2) She tbund the door.In order to give an analogous treatment to thereferring expression "the door", we have to treatit as elliptical tbr an exl)ression containing anested referring expression, i.e., "the door of thehouse".
In the same way that we have a mean-ing postulate for the relation mother of, we haveone for the relation door of:aSkolemization preserves dm dependency of Y on X,i.e., #94 is present in #60(#94).vx((ho,, e(x) v car(X))qY (of (Y, AZ(door( Z) ), X)~eard(Y, 1)))This means that, having used utterance (1)above to update the discourse model, we havethe fbllowing amongst the facts in DiscourseState 1:Discourse State 1seel(#138)0(#138, agent, #94)0(#138, object, #139)card(#139, 1)house( #139)ends_be for'e(#4(1), #sat )door(#46(#139))entrance( #46( #139 ) )of(#46(#139),  ~d(door'(A)), #139)card(#46(#139),  1aspect(simple, #137, #138)In updating utterance (2), the bridging descrip-tion which needs to be dereDrenced has the tbl-lowing representation:ref(AE(door(E) g~ card(E, 1)))Since we caimot guarantee that there will onlybe a single entity in our model satisfying thet)roperties kE(door(E) & card(E, 1)), we wantto ensure that the referent we obtain is eitherthe most recently mentioned or that with themost recently mentioned antecedent, i.e., in thiscase, the house #139.
Our ret>rence resolu-tion t)rocedure xploits the fact that the house,#139, is explicitly represented in the forwardlooking centres of Discourse State 1 and thatthe intended referent, #46(#139), is clearly aflmction of this (its dependency having beenpreserved by Skolemization).
In considering thepotential refbrents for our referring expression illorder of recency, we attempt o prove, not sim-ply, ibr each referent, X, whether door(X) andcar'd(X, 1), but door(V) and card(Z, 1) whereY is a function of X.
Since #46(#139) isa function of the antecedent #139, we obtainthe appropriate referent in this case by provingdoor(#46(#139)) and card(#46(#139), 1 .3.2 SuperlativesWe are now in a I)osition to describe our treat-ment of the superlatives discussed in the intro-duction.
First, we consider a case in which thereis a discourse antecedent of sorts:778(1) Two men arrived.
(2) The first man spoke.Discom:se State 1 contains the tbllowing facts:Discourse State 1arrive( #107)0(#107, agent, #1.08)card(#108, 2)man(#108)male(#108).~(#108)adult(#108)~n&_b<l'o,'d #4(1), #106)a.s'pect(.simplc, #106, #107)Our representation of the referring exi)ression"the first man" is as follows:rcf(k\]3('mo,st(B,~C(early( C, AD(man(D)))),,.~f (~E(,,,o,,,,(~))))x~ ,-..,.d(u.

( X, P, _) -+~Y (mosl,(Y, P, X)&card(Y, N))))This siml)ly says that tbr any severalton set X,any property 1 ) and any N, there is some set Ycontaining the N "most P" members of X. Thismeaning postulate does not translate into anyfacts in Discourse State 0, lint remains as a rule.When we have a particular eferring expressionto derefhrence, this rule enables us to prove that:most(#81(kA(early(A,...)), 1, 2, #108, #108),,x ( c ( ~,~,.ly( c, ~D ( .,,,,,.,( D ) ) ) ),#108)card(#81 (AA(c'arly (A, .
.
. )
) ,  1, 2, @ 108, @ 108),1)In this way, we prove that the referring ex-pression makes sense, i.e., denotes.
However,unlike in the previous cases, we do not deret-erence to a familiar referent.
There are noexisting facts in the database about the ref-erent #81(AA(early(A,...)), 1, 2, @108, #108).Instead, in this case, we have to add to Dis-course State 2 the facts we have proved.Discourse state 2?

prove, about our refe.rentbeing e~rly, male, etc., are required if we are tobe aMe to subsequently retb.r to it using referringexpressions such as "he".
The.se are generatedfrom a set of associated memfing postulates:VXVYVP((ordered(P)~most(Y, P, X)) -+ P.Y)V A ( ordered( AB (early( B, A))))vxvP(,.~o,,.1,,(x, 1,) -~ p.x)VX ('m, an( X)(X is h, uman)~male(X)&adult(X))vx(mde(x)  -~ re(x))In addition to these, we have two further mean-ing postulates for superlatives:vxvYvevcvz( , , .o~t(Y ,  1; X),~a,.d(Y, C)g,,,os~,(Z, P, X)*~a,.d(Z, C)-~z=Y)VXVI'VYVNVC(most( X, P, Z)&card(X, N)~card(V, C)-~ ~,~o,.~( N, C) )779The first of these, the uniqueness meaning pos-tulate, states that if there are two subsets of ofa set which share the same cardinality mid thesame superlative property, such as first, thenthey must be regarded as identical 7.
The sec-ond simply ensures that any mffamiliar ret5r-ent which we obtain via our meaning postu-lates can sensibly regarded as a proper subsetof its antecedent; hat is, it prevents us regard-ing "two men" as a potential antecedent of "thefirst men":(1) Two meni arrived.
(2) The first men,f(i) spoke.Our treatment of superlatives without dis-course antecedents is similar to that above.

Like that for "the first man", thiscontains a nested referring expression:ref(),g(of(J,AK ( snowdrop( K) ),~card(L, 1)))))))The difference is that, in this case, there isno discourse antecedent for the nested refer-ring expression.
This means that, in order to7practicaUy, this meaning postulate seems to be re-dundant.
Our meaning postulates generate for us onlyone such subset and it is impossible for another to beintroduced through the discourse as "a first man" is un-grammatical.anchor our referring expression by dereferenc-ing the referring expression ested within it, weneed to introduce a meaning postulate for thenested referent (and one for its nested referent,Spring):3X ( X, rd( X, 1))qX(of(X,) ) )&card(X, pl) )These meaning postulates simply introduce intoDiscourse State 0 the fact that there are snow-drops of Spring, in the same way that the mean-ing postulate for "Mary" introduced the factthat there is a singleton set containing an in-dividual so named.Discourse state 0season(#98)named(#98, Spring)card(#98, 1)extended(#98)snowdrop(#101)of(#101, A(A, snowdrop(A)), #98)..(#101)card(#101, pl)Given the above facts in Discom'se State O, an-choring our referring expression is straighttbr-ward.f ( E(.

Having made sense of such referringext)ressions, we add their referents to our dis-course model.
This is how we would normallydeal with indefinites rather than definites.
How-ever, this al)t)roach makes t)erfect sense, givenour treatment of su('h referring exl)ressions asdenoting unfamiliar subsets of familiar referents(regarded as sets).
We claim that we are ableto use definite descriptions to refer to the ref-erents in question, despite their unfamiliarity,SO long as we Call prove that, by virtue of theirmeaning, they denote uniqnely.Having imt)lemented our approach in a sys-tem of language understanding which alreadydeals with a wide variety of referring expres-sions, we have demonstrated its practicality.It also has interesting theoretical implications,since it suggests a way in which pragmatic theo-ries of reference resolution, like Familiarity The-ory, and semantic theories, like Russell's, maybe reconciled.
However, it is fair to say thatthe success of the approach is not yet proven.This is because we have yet to show that wecan deal with a set of related referring expres-sions within a single fi'amework.
The followingexample illustrates the kinds of cases we havein mind:(1) Three meni ate.
(2) Two menj slept.
(3) The first meni died.Here, "first" in "the first men" is clearly per-tbrming a dit\[erent, discourse-related flmctionfrom that it p lws in the cases we have beenconsidering.
We have yet to tackle such difficultcases but, since they seem to require reasoningabout sets, we believe that our inference-basedapproach to reference resolution is a good placeto start.Re ferencesB.
