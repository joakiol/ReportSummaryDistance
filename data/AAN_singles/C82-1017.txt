Academ~ 19~ON THE ROLE OF THE HIERARCHY OF ACT IVAT ION INTHE PROCESS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDINGEva Haj i6ov~, Jarka Vrbov~Department  of Appl ied Mathemat icsFacul ty  of Mathemat ics  and PhysicsChar les  Univers i tyPragueCzechos lovak iaThe e lements of the stock of knowledge shared.by the speaker and the hearer change their sal-ience, in the sense of being immediate ly  access-ible in the bearer 's  memory.
The h ierarchy ofsal ience is argued to be a basic component  of amechan ism serving for the ident i f icat ion of ref-erence.
Some of the regular i t ies  of this mechan ismare discussed,  the descr ipt ion  of which is a nec-essary prerequis i te  of an automatic  understand ingof connected texts.i.
When d iscuss ing  the quest ion of what is the main contr ibut -ion of computat iona l  l inguist ics  to theoret ica l  l inguist ics  at oneof the panel  d iscuss ions  at Co l ing 80 in Tokyo, the panel is ts  unan-imously pointed to the due emphasis laid on the funct ion of naturallanguage in communicat ion.
In this direct ion,  it is known from thec lass ica l  Prague School that the topic/ focus ar t i cu la t ion  belongs tothe most  important  aspects  connect ing the structure of language withthe condi t ions of its use.
However, this ar t icu lat ion  I was not exam-ined systemat ica l ly  in most  of the main l inguist ic  trends, so thatthe p ioneers  who are aware of its importance for natural  languageunderstand ing (esp.
Grosz, 1977, Reichman, 1978, 1981, McKeown, 1979,Hirst, 1981) attempt to f ind their  own ways.Dur ing the d iscourse the stock of "knowledge" the speaker as-sumes to share wi th  the hearer changes accord ing to what is "in thecentre of attent ion" at the given t ime point.
2 Each utterance has itsinf luence on this h ierarchy of sal ience; however,  not every ment ion-ing of an object  has the same effect.
The assumpt ion that the degreesof sa l ience const i tute  a part ia l  order ing is corroborated e.g.
by thedegrees of consc iousness  character ized by Chafe (1974).Let us denote by x ~ an express ion x re ferr ing to an object  athat is sal ient to the -qa- degree n in the stock; since the max imumof sa l ience can more easi ly  than other degrees be imagined to be fix-ed, we denote it by ~ = ~, revers ing the d i rect ion of"growth" of thedegrees; to the left (r ight) of the arrow we indicate the stateimmediate ly  preceding (fol lowing) the utterance of a sentence S inwhich x occurs; x c F (T) stands for "x belongs to the focus (~opic)of S";--P(x ) denotes that x is expressed either by a weak pronounor Ts d~le~ed in S, though--present in its tectogrammat ica l  represent~at ion (TR);3 with--NP.
_(x ) we refer to def in i te  NP's and to such _--~a~e a NP's as one of the N, ~o~ (of the) N.Accord ing  to a pre l iminary  empir ica l  invest igat ion it appearsthat : the fo l lowing rules concern ing the degrees of sa l ience obtain107108 E. HAJI~OVA and J. VRBOVA(cf.
a f i rst  formulat ion of some of them in Sgall, 1980a, p.240),where m, n > ~:(i) If P(X_a), then a_n- + a_ n-(2) If NP(x a) C \[, then a_ n- ?

teacher  or pupi l  are w i thschoo l, or parents  wi th  chi ld, e--t-~..)(5) If As for xa, or C0noern in~ x a is present  in S, thena ~ + a I ~(6) If ~a is not  inc luded in the TR of S, not even among theassoc ia ted  ob jects  (see Rule (4)), then a ~ + a n-+2As was po inted out  by Sgal l  (1967a, p.95f.
;  198Ob), the d i f fer -ence between n = ~ and n = 1 is too small  to make the re ferenceass ignment  un\ [vocal  <if--such speci f ic  pronouns as Czech ten, Germander or Engl.
the latter are not present) :  If Char les  met  PAUL isf-o\[lowed by He wore his HAT, we may only  guess whether  he refers  toPaul and his to Char les,  or v ice w~rsa, or whether  a th i rd poss ib i l i -ty is present.
However,  whenever  the d i f ference in the degrees of sal-ience is greater,  an occurrence of a pronoun or of a de f in i te  NP inthe next  ut terance regu lar ly  refers  - as we want  to i l lust rate  in thesequel  - to that ob ject  which  was referred to as the most  sa l ient  a-mong those that meet  the lexical  and grammat ica l  condi t ions  of theNP or pronoun <number, gender).
The two main types of the thematicprogress ions  descr ibed  by Dane~ (1968; 1976) are important  here.
A lsoHobbs (1976) spec i f ies  a common heur is t ics  for reso lv ing  pronouns,wh ich  says that  we should prefer  the subject  to an NP in the ob jectpos i t ion  (in other  words, since the subject pos i t ion  in Eng l i shfunct ions as a rule as (a part  of) the topic of the sentence, thisheur is t ics  says that  the t Jpic is pre ferab ly  preserved in success ivesentences).
Another  poss ib le  strategy <Hobbs, 1979) inc ludes infer-enc ing and factual  knowledge.In our ru les some of the re lat ionsh ips  between the sa l ience andthe pragmat ic  re la t ionsh ips  of lexical  units  are t reated only  in apre l iminary  way.
Thus e.g.
Rule (4) or a s imi lar  rule should ref lectalso a rather  common s i tuat ion when a ment ion ing  of a part icu lar  ob-ject (or objects)  br ings into foreground only a f ract ion of a setof ob jects  that a l ready are in the fore~round of the stock of know-ledge.
It does not capture the case when the foregrounded object(s)belong to a set the act ivat ion  of which has a l ready faded away underthe threshold  of act ivat ion;  it seems to be a p laus ib le  hypothes isthat  even in such a case the "rest" of the objects  are being act ivat -ed beyond this th resho l~ by ment ion ing  the foregrounded object(s) ,even if to a very  low extent.2.
Let us i l lust rate  the above rules on a f ragment of text; weare not concerned wi th  a systemat ic  l inguist ic  analys is  of the g iventext here, but we coBcentrate  on the changes of act ivat ion  of thee lements of the stock of shared knowledge as re f lected (and induced3by the discourse.
We restr ic t  ourse lves  to ob jects  ident i f ied by NP'sor pronouns and we leave as ide act ions and their  c i rcumstant ia lON THE ROLE OF HIERARCHY OF ACTIVATION 109qual i f icat ions.
The capi ta l  letters denote the intonat ion centre ofeach clause; for the ease of reference,  the c lauses are numbered.A part ia l  pre l iminary  d iscuss ion  of such a text was presented in Ha-j i~ov~ and Vrbov~ (1982).\[I\] The school garden was full of CHILDREN.\[2a\] They ta lked NOISILY,\[2b\] but  the teachers did not REPROVE them,\[20\] because they were so EXCITED.\[3\] Outs ide PARENTS were wait ing.\[4\] A group of about  f ive parents  grouped around the MICROPHONE.\[5\] One of them should probably  SPEAK,\[6\] The teachers  were very SERIOUS.\[7\] In fact, ALL ADULTS in the garden were serious.\[8\] They were dressed in evening DRESSES.\[9\] CQncern ing the pupils,  they had school UNIFORMS.\[i0\] The smal lest  had even snow-white COLLARS.\[lla\] The tall on the contrary  LAUGHED at them,\[llb\] because they pretended not to be INTERESTED.\[12a\] Their  teachers did not L IKE that,\[12b\] whi le  the teachers of the small  were ev ident ly  PROUD..\[13\] The parents  at the microphone d iscussed something in a WHISPER.\[14\] Then one of them, a father, stepped FORWARD\[,15~ and SAID:\[16\] The Society of Fr iends of this school is h ighly  sat is f ied wi ththe results  of our lowest GRADES.\[17\] Then he PAUSED.\[18\] Some parents  in the audience began to MURMUR.\[i9\] The father at the microphone tr ied to SILENCE them.\[20\] He was puzzled.\[21\] The pra ised ch i ldren immediate ly  started to C~TTER.\[22\] One small pupi l  SCREAMED:\[23\] HURRAH!\[24\] The teachers  of the older pupi ls  made FACES.\[25\] The parents who were representat ives  of the Society wi ld lyGESTICULATED.\[26\] A mother  suddenly FAINTED.\[27\] The courageous chi ld stopped SCREAMING.\[28\] His c lassmates ASKED him so.\[29\] The least exc i ted seemed the o ldest  PUPILS.\[30\] The boys ' CHEWED\[31\] and the gir ls  GIGGLED.A s impl i f ied l ist  of the most  act ivated objects  after  the indiv idualutterances:\[i\] ch i ldren ~ school  garden I parents 2 school 3 pupi ls  3\[2a\] ch i ldren ~ parents 2 school garden 3 school 5 ...\[2b\] ch i ldren teachers I parents 2 school 3 ...\[2c\] either: ch i ldren ~ teachers 3 parents  2 school 5 o..or: teachers ~ ch i ldren 2 school 2 parents 4 o..parents  ~ ch i ldren 2 teachers 5(3) school 5 ... \[3\]\[4\] microphone ~ parents l  I {~those at the micro) parents21 ch i ldren 3\[5\] parentsl  ~ microphone 2 parents22 chi ldren 3 ...\[6\] teachers I parents!

We omit  those c lauses the commentary  towhich fol lows t r iv ia l ly  from the previous comments and from the rules.\[I\] In the opening sentence of the text two objects  are introduced:the school garden and the chi ldren.
Since the latter object  is ment-ioned in the focus of the sentence, it becomes more sal ient  than ob-jects ment ioned prev ious ly  or those act ivated by their  presence inthe broader context  or s ituation.
Also the assoc iated objects  suchas school, pupi ls,  and teachers  are now re la t ive ly  sal ient.\[2a\] The ch i ldren as a h ighly sal ient ob ject  in the stock of sharedknowledge are referred to in the topic pos i t ion  by a pronoun, whichkeeps their  act ivat ion  at  the same degree (see Rule El)), whi le  theact ivat ion  of the other ob jects  <Rule (6)) fades away.\[2b\] A new object  enters the scene: the teachers.
However,  theirappearance on the scene is not complete ly  new and surpr is ing,  becausethe hearer has a l ready been introduced into the scene of school,which has the teachers  assoc iated with it (see Rule <4)).
This  iswhy the teachers can be understood as re fer r ing  to the teachers ofthe ch i ldren and the school which were a l ready ment ioned.
In accord-ON THE ROLE OF HIERARCHY OF ACTIVATION 111ance wi th  Rule (3) the degree of sal ience of teachers is I. Thech i ldren remain on the scene - they are reminded by a pronominal  re-ference in the topic and their  act ivat ion  does not fade away (seeRule <i)).
It should be noted that even though the pronoun them is inthe f inal  pos i t ion of the sentence, it is preceded by the intonat ioncentre; it is wel l  known that all part ic ipants  p laced after the inton-at ion centre be long to the topic part  of the sentence.\[2c\] The pronoun in the topic has an  indist inct  reference:  both teach-ers and ch i ldren may be referred to.
This ind is t inctness  of re ferenceis d i f f i cu l t  to solve: accord ing to the strategies ment ioned in Sect.2 the two objects  are sal ient enough to be referred to by a weak pro-noun, and the teachers  as wel l  as the ch i ldren can be excited in thegiven situation, so that not even factual  knowledge with in ferenc inggives a safe clue.
The formulat ion of the text  can be character i zedas not successfu l  in this point.
However, if the lexical  sett ing of\[2c\] were changed, as in \[2c ~\] and \[2c''\], the ind is t inctness  woulddisappear,  and only one of the two poss ib le  candidates  of re ferencewould be chosen, namely the teachers in \[2c'\] and the chi ldren \[2c''\]:\[2c'\] .
.
.
because they were always kind to their  pupi ls.\[2c''\].. .
because they were too small to understand the ser iousness, .
.\[3\] A new object  is being introduced in the focus of the sentence; a-gain, it can be said that it is not complete ly  new, because it is alsog iven by the broader scene <of fami ly relat ions:  ch i ldren - parents).This newly introduced item receives a very high degree of act ivat ion,whi le  the other two objects - the ch i ldren and the teachers - are notment ioned in this sentence at all and thus their  act ivat ion fadesaway (see Rule <6)).\[4\] The speaker chooses a subset of the most  act ivated set of e lementsand speaks about this subset; he introduces a new object  on the scene,which receives a high degree of act ivat ion  (see Rule <2)), but sinceit does not appear in any of the fo l lowing utterances,  this act ivat -ion later fades away step by step <Rule (6)>.
The complement  to theset of f ive parents  - the rest of the pa~ents - reta ins the degree ofa rather high act ivat ion,  see Rule (3).\[6\] One of the items the act ivat ion  of which has been fad ing away<the teachers)  is back on the scene; the teachers  may be referred toby a def in i te  NP in the topic s ince the act ivat ion  has not been low-ered under a certa in  threshold,  which would otherwise  lead to anexpl ic i t  re introduct ion.\[~9\] An expl ic i t  re in t roduct ion  of the ch i ldren is preferred by thespeaker s ince the ch i ldren have not been ment ioned in several  preced-ing utterances;  their  act ivat ion  has been lowered considerably.
Forsuch strong re -act ivat ion  express ions such as concernin@, as far as... is concerned, as for ... are used.\[I0\] Only one subset of the ch i ldren is expl ic i t ly  ment ioned in thissentence; the act ivat ion  of this item of knowledge is ra ised <Rule<3)), but also the complement  subset of pupi ls  is "supported" in itsact ivat ion  <Rule <i)), which does not fade away as it would be thecase if no pupi ls  were menuioned at all <Rule <6)).\[llb\] The reference of the pronoun ~ is again indist inct;  it mayrefer e i ther to the smal lest  or to the tall  pupils.
Nei ther  of thestrategies ment ioned above helps: both the NP s the tal l  <pupils)and the smal lest  <pupils) are in the topic pos i t ion  of \[lla\], andboth are act ivated to the same extent: the smal lest  pupi ls  were re-ferred to in \[lla\] by pronoun them and the act ivat ion 'o f  this i temwas preserved <Rule (I)) ; the tall  were ment ioned by a def in i te  NP inthe topic, which  keeps their  act ivat ion.
This ind is t inctness  remains112 E. HAJI~OV~, and S. VRBOV.~unsolved even after the ut terance of \[12a\], which adds another  in-d is t inct  reference <their teachers - whose?
of the smal lest?
of thetall?)
and it is on ly  after hear ing \[12b\] that the hearer can decide:there the expl ic i t  ment ion ing  of the teachers of the small ch i ld renresolves the ind is t inct  re ference of their  in \[12a\] and at the sametime our factual  knowledge of the wor ld  invites the inference that ifthe small  ch i ldren pretended not to be interested,  their  teacherswould have noth ing to be proud of, so that they in \[llb\] can referonly to the tal l  pupi ls.\[16\] The speaker of the d i rect  speech is not ment ioned in the quote(only by means of his re ference to the Society of Fr iends of theSchool, of which  he undoubted ly  is a member),  but the act ivat ion  ofthis item does not seem to fade away.
This  appears to be a generalfeature of d i rect  speech, wh ich  fol lows from the semant ico -syntact i cstructure of the d i rect  speech, where the "direct speech c lause"funct ions as an ob ject  (Pat ient)  of the in t roductory  c lause (and thespeaker, as the Actor  of the sentence, belongs to the TR of the samesentence).\[27\] The use of the courageous chi ld  to refer to the small pupi l  whoscreamed "Hurrah!"
of fers  another  example of the in ferenc ing the hear-er must  per form in order to understand what is the sentence about andto determine the reference,  even in cases where full NP's  rather  thanpronouns are used.It is also easy to ver i fy  that wi th other var iants  of the textthe weak pronoun they, if it were used after  each of the sentences\[5\](e.g.
in 6": The ch i ld ren  observed them, ...) , \[6\], \[13\], \[18\],etc., would  lack any re ferent ia l  ind ist inctness;  s imi lar ly  for heafter \[14\] <where, in fact, the pronoun is de leted) , \ [17\ ] ,  \[22\], etc.The referent ia l  ind is t inctness  is present  (and must  be solved bymeans of in ferencing)  after such ut terances as e.g.
\[2b\], \[9\], \[IO\],\[lla\], \[12a\], where objects  with the degrees @ and 1 can be re fer redto by the same pronoun.
In a s imi lar  wav the ind is t inctness  of thereference of nouns can be studied,cf ,  e.g.
the use of father in \[19\](synonymous with he, whi le  in \[20\] the pronoun and in \[27\] the nounis necessary) .3.
To conclude,  it should be noted that when speaking about  theh ierarchy of sa l ience (act ivat ion)  and of degrees of ac t ivat ion  ofitems of the stock of shared knowledge we do not have in mind anabsolute scale or l inear order ing  of elements.
The raise or drop ofact ivat ion  should be a lways taken as re lated to the other i tems ofthe stock.
In the rules, we use two kinds of raise: a mi ld  one <Rule<3)), and a strong one <Rule (2));  it may be the case that furtherempir ica l  research wi l l  lead us to a more subtle c lass i f icat ion.Also, we are aware that this is a point  where l inguist ic  and psycho l -ogical  invest igat ions  should go hand in hand.
Anyhow, we are cnnvinc-ed that such an empir ica l  research,  if guided by an attempt at a moreexpl ic i t  and systemat ic  descr ipt ion,  is of pr imary importance for(automatic)  language comprehension,  and as such also for all app l icat -ional pro jects  of text understanding.FOOTNOTES:1 See Sgall  (1967b; 1975), Sgal l  and Haj i~ov~ (1977), Haj i~ov~and Sgal l  (1980), Sgall,  Haj i~ov~ and Bene~ov~ (1973).2 The term "giveness" is often used in a s imi lar  sense, but itshould be born in mind that a "given" i tem may be in contrast ,  or ir-recoverable  (in the terms of Hal l iday),  or not ident i f iab le  (Chafe),so that a def in i te  noun may wel l  occur inside the focus of a sentence.ON THE ROI.~ OF HIERARCHY OF ACTIVATION 1133 The TR of a sentence has the form of a dependency tree,labelled by complex symbols with the main predicate as its root; anordering of the nodes is defined with respect to their so-called com-municative dynamism, fulfi l l ing the condition of projectivity; for adetailed description of TR's in the framework of the functional gen-erative description, to which we subscribe, see Sgall (1967a); Haji-~ov~ and Sgall (1980); and Panevov~ in this volume.REFERENCES:\[i\] Chafe, W.L., Language and consciousness, Language 50(1974)111-133.\[2\] Dane~, F., Typy tematick~ch posloupnost/ v textu \[Types of them-atic progressions in text\], Slovo a slovesnost 29 (1968) 125-141.\[3\] Dane~, F., Zur semantischen und thematischen Struktur des Komuni-kats, in: Probleme der Textgrammatik (Berlin, 1976, 28-40).\[4\] Grosz, B.J., The representation and use of focus in dialogueunderstanding, Techn.
