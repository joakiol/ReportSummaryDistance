We obtainedpromising results, with a best F-measure of0.81 for the partial matching task when us-ing post-processing.
Using only ConditionalRandom Fields the results are slightly lower,achieving still a good result in terms of F-measure.
Using the ChEBI ontology alloweda significant improvement in precision (bestprecision of 0.93 in partial matching task),which indicates that taking advantage of anontology can be extremely useful for enhanc-ing chemical entity recognition.1 IntroductionMost chemical named entity recognition systemscan be classified in two approaches: dictionarybased and machine learning based approaches.
Dic-tionary based approaches are usually easier to im-plement and maintain, but require a reference chem-ical term dictionary and are dependent on its com-pleteness and quality.
The availability of publicchemical databases has been an issue until recently,when several publicly available databases such asPubChem (Wang et al 2009), DrugBank (Wishartet al 2006) and ChEBI (Degtyarenko et al 2007)were released.
An example of a popular system thatuses this approach is Whatizit (Rebholz-Schuhmannet al 2008).
Machine learning based approachesare not limited to a terminology and are thus bettersuited for finding novel chemical terms that are yetto be inserted in reference databases.
However thisapproach requires training data for a classifier to beable to successfully learn and perform the chemi-cal entity recognition task.
Some methods combineboth approaches and thus are hybrid systems thataim to take the best out of both approaches (Jessopet al 2011; Rockta?schel et al 2012).An annotated corpus of patent documents was re-leased by ChEBI, and using such corpus as train-ing data we developed an chemical entity recogni-tion system (Grego et al 2009) that uses a ma-chine learning approach based on Conditional Ran-dom Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al 2001).
We fur-thermore expanded our method to allow resolutionof recognized entities to the ChEBI ontology (Gregoet al 2012).This paper describes how our system (Grego etal., 2012) was adapted to perform the task of recog-nition and classification of drug names, and presentsthe results obtained in the task 9.1 of the 7th Interna-tional Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval2013).2 Task and DatasetThe Task 9 of SemEval 2013 involved two sub-tasks:(9.1) recognition and classification of drug names,and (9.2) extraction of drug-drug interactions fromBiomedical Texts (SemEval, 2013).
The recognitionand classification of drug names (Task 9.1) com-prises two steps.
First is chemical named entityrecognition, that consists in finding in a sentencethe offsets for the start and end of a chemical entity.660An exact match is achieved by correctly identifyingboth the start and end offset, as curators manuallyprovided them.
If there is a mismatch in the offsetsbut there is some overlap with a manual annotation,then it is considered a partial match, otherwise it isa recognition error.The second step consists in classifying each rec-ognized entity in one of four possible entity types:i) Drug is any pharmaceutical product approved forhuman use; ii) Brand is a drug that was first devel-oped by a pharmaceutical company; iii) Group refersto a class or group of drugs; iv) Drug n is an ac-tive substance that has not been approved for humanuse.
Thus, the evaluation takes into account not onlyentity recognition, but also the assigned type.
Typematching assessment considers the entity type evalu-ation from partial matching entity recognition, whilestrict matching considers the entity type evaluationfrom exact matching.For training, the DDI corpus dataset was provided(Segura-Bedmar et al 2006).
This dataset containstwo sub-datasets.
One that consists of MedLine ab-stracts, and other that contains DrugBank abstracts.An unannotated test dataset was provided for testingand evaluating the systems.3 CRF entity recognitionOur method uses CRFs for building probabilis-tic models based on training datasets.
We usedthe MALLET (McCallum, 2002) implementation ofCRFs.
MALLET is a Java-based package for sta-tistical natural language processing, document clas-sification, clustering, topic modeling, informationextraction, and other machine learning applicationsto text, which includes an implementation of linearchain CRFs.A required first step in our method in the tok-enization of the input text.
For this task we haveused a specifically adapted tokenizer for chemicaltext adapted from an open source project (Corbett etal., 2007).Each token is then represented as a set of features.We kept using a set of features derived in our previ-ous work (Grego et al 2009), which includes foreach token:Stem: The stem of the token.Prefix: The first three characters of the token.Suffix: The last three characters of the token.Number: Boolean that indicates if the token con-tains digits.In addition to the set of features, each token is alsogiven a label in accordance to the training data:NO: A non-chemical token.NE: A chemical entity represented by a single to-ken.S-NE: The first token of a multi-token chemical en-tity.M-NE: A middle token of a multi-token chemi-cal entity (only exists for entities composed bythree or more tokens).E-NE: The last token of a multi-token chemical en-tity.The task of entity recognition will be the assign-ment of such labels to new, unannotated text, basedon a model.
The assigned label allows for namedentities to be recognized and offsets provided.For creating a model, it is required as input a setof annotated documents.
Our method was initiallydeveloped using an annotated patent document cor-pus released to the public by the ChEBI team.
Thiscorpus can be found at 1, and we decided to keep us-ing it as training data for a model.
Together with thiscorpus, the DDI corpus training dataset provided forthe task was used.
The model produced by usingthis combination of training data, that we called Allmodel, will be suited for general purpose chemicalentity recognition.We then prepared four datasets based on the DDIcorpus dataset but containing only one type of anno-tated entities each.
With that training data we pre-pared four more models, each trained only with onekind on entity type.
Thus we have in total preparedfive models:All: A model trained with all entity types of the DDIcorpus dataset, and the ChEBI released patentdataset.1http://chebi.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/chebi/chapati/patentsGoldStandard/661Drug: A model trained only with the entities of typedrug in the DDI corpus dataset.Brand: A model trained only with the entities oftype brand in the DDI corpus dataset.Group: A model trained only with the entities oftype group in the DDI corpus dataset.Drug n: A model trained only with the entities oftype drug n in the DDI corpus dataset.Using the type specific models it is possible toannotate text with only one entity type.
Thus ourmethod now has the capability of entity type classifi-cation in addition to named entity recognition, usingthese type specific models.4 ChEBI resolutionAfter having recognized the named chemical enti-ties, our method tries to perform their resolution tothe ChEBI ontology.
ChEBI (Chemical Entities ofBiological Interest) is a freely available dictionaryof small molecular entities.
In addition to molecularentities, ChEBI contains groups (parts of molecularentities) and classes of entities, allowing for an onto-logical classification that specifies the relationshipsbetween molecular entities or classes of entities andtheir parents and/or children.
The ontology structureprovides an integrated overview of the relationshipsbetween chemical entities, both structural and func-tional.The resolution method takes as input the stringidentified as being a chemical compound name andreturns the most relevant ChEBI identifier alongwith a confidence score.To perform the search for the most likely ChEBIterm for a given entity an adaptation of FiGO, alexical similarity method (Couto et al 2005).
Ouradaptation compares the constituent words in the in-put string with the constituent words of each ChEBIterm, to which different weights have been assignedaccording to its frequency in the ontology vocabu-lary (Grego et al 2012).
A resolution score between0 and 1 is provided with the mapping, which corre-sponds to a maximum value in the case of a ChEBIterm that has the exact name as the input string, andis lower otherwise.5 Post-processingTo further improve the quality of the annotationsprovided by our method, some na?
?ve rules were cre-ated and external resources used.One of the rules implemented is derived from theresolution process, and corresponds in classifyingan entity as type Group if its ChEBI name is plu-ral.
This is because ChEBI follows the conventionof naming its terms always as a singular name, ex-cept for terms that represent classes of entities wherea plural name can be used.We have also used other resources in the post-processing besides ChEBI, namely a list of brandnames extracted from DrugBank.
This list of brandnames was used to check if a given entity was partof that list, and if it was the entity should be of thetype Brand.A common English words list was also used as ex-ternal resource in post-processing.
If a recognizedchemical entity was part of this list then it was arecognition error and should be filtered out and notbe considered a chemical entity.Some simple rules were also implemented in aneffort to improve the quality of the annotations.
Forinstance, if the recognized entity was found to becomposed entirely by digits, then it should be fil-tered out because it is most certainly an annotationerror.
Also, if an entity starts or ends with a char-acter such as ?
*?, ?-?, ?.
?, ?,?
or ??
?, then thosecharacters should be removed from the entity and theoffsets corrected accordingly.With such na?
?ve but efficient rules it was expectedthat the performance of entity recognition would im-prove.
An overview of the system architecture isprovided in Figure 1.6 Testing runsUsing different combinations of the described meth-ods, three runs were submitted for evaluation and arenow described.Run 1: This run uses all of the described methods.Entity recognition is performed using all mod-els, and the type classification is performed byusing the type specific models in the followingpriority: if an entity was recognized using theDrug n model, then type is Drug n, else if it662Figure 1: Overview of the system architecture.
Based onannotated corpus, CRF models are created and used toannotate new documents.was recognized using the Brand model, thentype is Brand, else if it was recognized usingthe Group model, then type is Group, else andfinally it is assigned the type Drug.
Resolutionto ChEBI is performed and all of the describedpost-processing rules applied.Run 2: In this run only the classifiers are used.
Thismeans that the entity recognition is performedusing all models, and the type classification isperformed by using the type specific models asdescribed in Run 1.
However no extra process-ing is performed and the results are submittedas obtained directly from the classifiers.Run 3: This run performs entity recognition ina similar way described in run 1, and per-forms entity recognition to the ChEBI ontol-ogy.
However, only the entities successfullymapped to ChEBI, with a resolution score ofat least 0.8, are considered.
All the other en-tities are discarded in this phase.
After reso-lution and the filtering of entities according tothe resolution to ChEBI, all the described post-processing rules are applied in a similar way toRun 1.7 Results and DiscussionThe official evaluation results are presented in Ta-ble 1.
We can observe that the obtained results arebetter for the DrugBank dataset than for the Med-Line dataset.
This may have happened because theDrugBank dataset is four times larger than the Med-Line dataset, but also because while the DrugBankabstracts are quite focused in drug descriptions anduse mostly systematic names, the MedLine ones areusually more generic and make more extensive useof trivial drug names.
We obtained for the Run 1 atop F-measure of 0.81 in the full dataset for a par-tial matching assessment, and that value decreasedto 0.78 when an exact matching assessment is con-sidered.
The values are very close, which means thatour method is being able to efficiently find the cor-rect offsets of the entities.
However the F-measuredecreases to 0.69 for partial matching and 0.66 forexact matching when the assignment of the entitytype is considered.
This means that there is room toimprove in the task of classifying the chemical enti-ties to the correct entity type.Run 2 obtained results very similar to Run 1, onlyslightly less F-measure.
The difference betweenthose two runs was that Run 2 used only the classi-fiers, while Run 1 used rules and external resourcesin an effort to improve the results.
We can thus con-clude that the classifiers alone produce already goodresults and more sophisticated post-processing is re-quired to obtain significant performance gains.
Ourpost-processing was very simple as explained ear-lier, and can only slightly improve the results ob-tained with the CRF classifiers alone.Run 3 obtained improved precision in all assess-ments.
In this run only the entities that were success-fully mapped to ChEBI were considered, and thusthe precision of recognition was the best of our runs.This is because ChEBI contains high quality, man-ually validated chemical terms.
If a recognized en-tity can be successfully mapped to this data source,then there is a good indication that it is, in fact, avalid chemical entity.
However F-measure has de-creased because of a loss in recall.

However ChEBI is growing at a steadypace and we believe its coverage will keep increas-ing while maintaining the high quality that allowsfor an excellent precision.
Thus, as ChEBI evolves,our approach will mantain the high levels of preci-sion but with a lower reduction in recall.ChEBI is not only a chemical dictionary, butan ontology.
This allows for a comparison recog-nized entities through semantic similarity measuresthat can be used to further enhance chemical en-tity recognition (Ferreira and Couto , 2010; Coutoand Silva , 2011).
This comparison can also be ex-tremely useful in other task such as drug-drug inter-action extraction.
Moreover, even if with a relativelysmall ChEBI, it can be possible to increase coverageby integrating other available resources using Ontol-ogy Matching techniques (Faria et al 2012).In Table 2 we have the official results obtainedfor each entity type, and we can observe that ourmethod is efficient in correctly classifying the Drugand Group types, where it achieves an F-measureof 0.74 and 0.71 correspondingly.
However ourmethod has some difficulties in correctly classify-ing entities of the Brand type, where an F-measureof 0.58 was obtained.
The Drug n entity type hasproven to be a very challenging type to be correctlyclassified, and our system failed the correct classi-fication of this type in most situations.
This is pos-sibly because the percentage of entities of this typeis very limited, and also because the difference be-tween this type and the Drug type is the fact thatthe later has been approved for human use, whilethe former has not.
The feature set used cannot ef-ficiently discriminate this information and externalinformation about drug approval for human usagemust be used for efficient detection of this type.Overall, Run 1 has obtained the best results.
How-ever, the results from Run 2 have been very similar,which shows that the classifiers have been success-ful and the post-processing of Run 1 has been mini-mal.
Run 3 was designed for high precision, becauseonly the entities successfully mapped to the ChEBIontology were considered.
It does improve the ob-tained precision, but suffers a drop in recall.
Table 3presents the macro-average measures obtained foreach run.8 ConclusionsThis paper presents our participation in the 7th In-ternational Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (Se-mEval 2013) using a CRF-based chemical entityrecognition method and a lexical similarity basedresolution method.
We prepared type-specific CRFmodels to allow both recognition and type classifi-cation of the chemical entities.
Mapping of the en-tities to the ChEBI ontology was performed usinga lexical similarity based method, and several post-processing rules using external resources where im-plemented.We submitted different runs on annotated test datausing different combination of such methods, andobtained a best precision of 0.89 and a best F-measure of 0.81 in the entity recognition task.
Forthe task of entity recognitions and classification wehave obtained a best precision of 0.78 and a best F-measure of 0.69.
We concluded that the classifiersprovide already good results by their own, that canbe slightly improved by using some na?
?ve externalresources and rules.However, using ChEBI allows for a significant in-crease of precision, which is encouraging.
We be-lieve this result is a good indication that as ChEBImatures, the methods that take advantage of its on-tology structure for entity recognition and classifica-tion will benefit more from its usage, increasing theF-measure obtained in the task.9 AcknowledgmentsThe authors want to thank the PortugueseFundac?a?o para a Cie?ncia e Tecnologia throughthe financial support of the SPNet project(PTDC/EBB-EBI/113824/2009), the SOMERproject (PTDC/EIA-EIA/119119/2010) and thePhD grant SFRH/BD/36015/2007 and through theLASIGE multi-annual support.
