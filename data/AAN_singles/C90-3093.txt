Box 373, SofiaBulgariaIntroductionThe pro jec t  note  presents  the  computer  programGECO (GEometry COnsu l te r ) ,  wh ich  generatesexp lanat ions  (descr ip t ions )  o f  geometr i ca lconcepts  in  Bu lgar ian .
Tile program rep l ies  toquest io t~s  such as  "What i s  X",  "Compare X and Y ' ,where X and Y are  concepts  in  geometry .
The ideato design GECO was in i t ia l l y  inspired by\ [HcKeown,1985\ ] ,  which gives information onmissiles?
However, unl ike TEXT, our system isable to give two types of descriptions : detai ledand br ie f .
For instance, i f  we ask "What is  at r iang le" ,  GECO gives a detai led descript ion,including de f in i t ion ,  the character is t ic  and non~character is t ic  features of the t r iang le ,  but i fwe ask once again within a dialogue the samequestion, the program remind~ us shortly thedefinition of the concept triangle.
This is doneby means of a special stack, which keeps aformalized dialogue history.
As in normal humand ia logue ,  the Systems rep l ies  to  a repeatedquestion in past tense (this is specific at leastof  Bu lgar ian) .
Here i s  a " recorded"  d ia loguebetween user  and GECO:User: What is a tr iangle?GECO: The t r iang le  is a convexstra ight ' l inear  plane geometrical f igure ,  whichpossesses 3 sides.
According to i t s  sides thet r iang le  can be equ i la tera l ,  isosceles andsca lene  and accord ing  to  i t s  ang les  ~ r ight -ang led ,  acute -ang led  and obtuse-ang led .. .

.User :  What i s  a t r iang le?GECO: The t r iang le  was a convex ,s t ra ight l inear  and plane geometrical f igure,which has three sides.I n  our  model o f  natura l  language generat ion ,we assume, that  the  task  o f  language 9enerat ioncan be divided into two stages: a conceptual anda l ingu is t i c  stage.
We agree with Danlos' claim\[Danlo~, 1985\], that the conceptual andlinguistic stage cannot be completelyi ndependent .
That  i s  why not  a l l  dec is ions  in  theConceptua l  s tage  o f  GECO are  to be f ixedinvariably.In \[Roesner, 1986\] i~ given a typology ofexplanations.
According to th is  typology, theexplanations, generated by our system are"informative xplanations, of s ta t i c  kind" ( th istype  inc ludes  the explanations of concepts ,  whatis our case).
Roesner proposes, that th i s  type ofexplanations should possibly include definitions,short descr ipt ive information, indicat ion,  wheremore information can be found, re lat ions  betweenconcepts etc.
Or ig ina l ly ,  GECO was  i n tu i t i ve ly  sodes igned,  that i t  p ract i ca l ly  met theseformal demands.Sublangua~ and discourseThe system has to do with the sublanguage ofschool geometry (taught in bulgarian schools).This sublanguage uses a comparatively rest r ic tedlexicon and not too great var iety of syntacticconstructions.
I t s  texts  (what is to be read inthe textbooks), however , are often overloadedwith very complicated complex sentences.
Goodsct~ool geometry  texts  a re  presented  in  ba lancedway by s imple  and complex sentences .Studying discourse pecualiarities of schoolgeometry instruct ional  texts  helped us to designdiscourse rules, made use by the conceptualmodule, when ordering the content within a text .Generat ion  o f  text  requ i res  the  ab i l i ty  how too rgan ize  ind iv idua l  sentences .
A reasonab lewri ter  does not randomly  order  the  sentences inhis text ,  but rather plans an overal l  frameworkor out l ine,  from which the individual sentencesare  produced.
Character i s t i c  of the  descr ip t ionof a geometrical concept is the introduction ofi t s  superordinate, i t s  constituents and providingsome addit ional  information to i t  (e.g.var ie t ies ) .
In th is  way the descript ion of thegeometrical concept  "quadr i la tera l "  possiblyincludes i t s  superordinate (polygon), i t sconstituents (4 s t ra ight l inear  sides, which bui ldup a convex f igure and l ie  in one plane, i .d.
i thas 4 sides and is convex, s t ra ight l inear  andplane) and i t s  var ie t ies  (parallelogram,rectangular e tc . )
.Semant ic  kr~w1ed@e repremenJ~t ion  m~le lThe semant ic  knowledge representat ion  modelused in the  System and proposed  by the  autor  isan extension of the model of Tiemann and Markle\[Tiemann and Harkle, 1978\] fo r  concept semantict 425knowledge representation.
The proposed modeldescribes each concept as a set of c r i t i ca l  andvariable at t r ibutes .
The concept introduces aclass of things, objects, events, ideas orre lat ions ,  so that each member of th is  classpossesses the same label, On the other hand i t  ispossible that a l l  the members of a class d i f fe rin one way or another and nevertheless areclassif ied together.
The character ist ic  features,possessed by all the members in a class arecal led crit ical attributes.
Variable attr ibutesare defined as character ist ic  features, whichmight d i f fe r  within class members.Consider the concept " t r iang le" .
Oursemantic knowledge representation model w i l ldescr ibe  i t  fo rmal ly  as  fo l lows :Triangle (geometrical f igure / plane, convex,s t ra ight l inear ,  three sides / acute-angled,r ight-angled, obtuse-angled; equ i la tera l ,i sosce les ,  sca lene/O) .The for l la l i sm o f  functi~nal descr ip t i~sDi f ferent  Formalisms require d i f fe rentapproaches, whose var iety may be sometimes(especial ly in implementation) problematic, Wehave adopted  in  our  model and system an extendedfunctional descript ion (FD) formalism, developedby Rousselot \[Rousselot, 1985\].
This formalismenables the representation o f  a l l  types ofknowledge.
A FD represents  a l i s t  o f  a t t r ibute -value pairs, j Rousselot's formalism is a veryextended form of the functional grammars \ [Kay,1985\].
Within the notation of FD we represent inthe domain knowledge base the geometricalconcepts (using the above concept semanticrepresentation approach) and the re lat ions  amongthem .
We represent also as FDs the grammar rulesin the l inguistic knowledge base.The ro le o f  l~ ica l  emphasisD i f fe rent  text  generat ion  systems make useo f  d i f fe rent  syntax  se lec t ion  approaches .
Thephenomena of focus is wide ly  used in textgenerat ion  \ [Der r  and McKeown, 1984\ ] ,  \[McKeown,1985\].
In b r ie f ,  i f  the focus is on theprotagon is t  o f  the  sentence  an act iveconstruction is  chosen, and i f  the focus is onthe goal - a passive one.
Thus i f  the system TEXT\[McKeown,1985\] should express the fact ,  that at r iang le  and c i rc le  touch each other and i f  thefocus is  on the protagonist (say t r iang le ) ,  thesystem would  generate  "The t r iang le  touches  thec i rc le" ,  but i f  the focus is  on the goal (sayc i rc le ) ,  the fo l lowi ing  sentence would beproduced "The t r iang le  is touched by the c i rc le" .Dan los  \ [Dan los ,1985\ ]  makes use o f  "d i scoursegrammar", that spec i f ies  the  syntax of  eachsentence .In our work we have elaborated for  the f i r s ttime on the logical  emphasis approach for  thesentence  syntax  se lec t ion .
The log ica l  emphas isin free order BulBarian is la id  on the last  wordof the sentence.
I t  plays a leading role inchoosing the  word order  in a sentence :  the  fac tthat the  t r iang le  has three  s ides  may beverbalized as "the t r iang le  has three sides" i fthe  log ica l  emphas is  i s  on "s ides"  o r  as  " threes ides  has the  t r iang le"  provided the  log ica lemphasis is on " t r iang le" .Production of  textThe grammar used to  produce  the  pre l iminarysur face  s t ruc ture  o f  the  generated  sentences  i sthe functional un i f i ca t ion  grammar \[Kay, 1985\].I f  a simple sentence grammar pattern (subjectverb object) with value "protagonist" for  thefuncional role (a t t r ibute)  " logical  emphasis" isuni f ied with the FD from the domain knowledgebase, describing the re la t ion ,  that each t r iang lehas three sides, the fol lowing sentence w i l l  begenerated :The t r iang le  possesses  three  s ides ,while the value "goal" for  the a t t r ibute  " logicalemphasis" y ie lds the result :Three  s ides  has the t r iang le .However ,  the  sentence  generated  by u~i fy ingthe  functional un i f i ca t ion  grammar with the  inputand representing a fact about or related to aconcept is not the f ina l  sentence thE) systemof fe rs  to i t s  users.
Although the result ingsentences of the previous examples sound quitereasonab ly  ( in  Bulgarian), the system would  notbe able to impress always i t s  users i f  i t  acceptsthe sentence as f ina l .
The problem is that eachexp lanat ion  o f  a concept  i s  not  a s ing lesentence, but discourse.
To i l l us t ra te  ourposit ion,  assume that the system has to give adetailed ( in i t ia l )  description of the concept" t r iang le"  (such description is actual ly  given byour system, see in the dialogue f i r s t  answer).After consecutive un i f i ca t ions  of the grammarrules with the relevant inputs , the system wouldgenerate in the best case the fol lowing 'text:The t r iang le  is a geometricalf igure.
The t r iang le  is s t ra ight l inear .The t r iang le  is plane (plane asadject ive) .
The t r iang le  is convex.
Thet r iang le  has three sides.
The t r iang lecan be isosceles, equi latera l  andscalene according to i t s  sides.
Thet r iang le  can be r ight-angled, acute--angled and obtuse-angles according toi t s  angles.426 2This is  a clumsy text ,  that no reasonableman would write.
The three main l ingu is t i coperations (part of the sys tem's  linguisticknowledge) that will process this priliminarytext are coordination, pronominalization ande l l ips i s .
Note that coordination w i l l  work on thef i r s t  'four sentences, pronominalization - on thefifth sentence and ellipsis - on the sentenceobtained from coord inat ion  of the last twosentences  (before these  three  operations arhetoric ru le  w i l l  have  operated, which says,that "according to" sounds better at thebeginning of the sentence and is not subject todeletion during coordination).
The processed textwi l l  be:The t r iang le  i s  a s t ra ight l inear .p lane  and convex  geometr i ca l  f igure ,  I thas three  s ides .
The t r iang le  can beisosceles, equ i la tera l  and sca leneaccord ing  to its sides.
The t r iang lecan be r ight -ang led ,  acute -ang led  andobtuse-ang led  accord ing  to its angles.According to i t s  s ides the  t r iang le  canbe equilateral, isosceles and scaleneand according to its angles - right-angled, acute-angled and obtuse-angled.There  are  a l so  fu r ther  l ingu is t i c  dec is ionsto  be made: shou ld  the  sentence  be in  ac t ive  orin  passive voice, should two or  more s implesentences  be combined in to  a s ing le  complex one(in the last sample text the first two sentencescan be combined into a complex one), howsubordinate clauses should be handled (we havedeve loped severa l  p rocedures  to  t reat  theproduction and connection of  subordinateclauses), should 9erundium be used etc.
In textgeneration systems such decisions are made on thebasis of lin9uistic phenomena such as focus,logical emphasis (in our case), causality etc.and are hot to be discussed in the present paper.Grmt i~ l  accordanceSince Bulgarian is  a highly in f lec t ivelanguage ( in f lec t ion  a f fect ing  not only nouns,but also adjectives, numerals, pronouns etc.
), wehave developed additional algorithms forgrammatical accordance.
We have developed analgorithm, which determines automatically thegender of the Bulgarian nouns (consisting of 254steps).
Another algorithm gives the definitearticle (in Bulgarian as a inflection; thereex is t  various de f in i te  a r t i c le  in f lec t ions)  ofeach noun and works parallelly to the first one.However, i f  a Bulgarian noun is in i t s  de f in i tea r t i c le  form, i t  is impossible to determinea lgor i thmica l ly  i t s  gender.
Therefore we havedeveloped addit ional  algorithms for  transformingdef in i te  a r t i c le  form of nouns into indef in i tearticle (normal) forms.
Moreover ,  the adjectives,numerals, the demonstrative and personal pronounsi n  Bu lgar ian  accord  w i th  the  nouns.
Consequent lywe have developed and implemented algorithms for'determining the indef in i te  a r t i c le  form ofadjectives (numerals, pronouns) and from i t  thegender form and def in i te  a r t i c le  form ofad jec t ives  (numera ls ,  p ronouns) .I ip lementat  ionGECO is a program, designed forinstruct ional  and experimental purposes.
I t s  mostpart has been already programmed on IBM PC/XT/AT(in Ksi Prolog).
The FDs are described withinProlog Def in i te  Clause Grammars (DFG) notation.Thus we have implemented a surface generationbased on both the DFG formalism and the formalismof FDs.
This idea we have adopted from Derr andMcKeown \[Derr and HcKeown, 1984\].
The result is agenerator with the best features of bothgrammars: s imp l i f i ca t i ion  of input by usingfunctional information and e f f i c iency  ofexecution from Prolog.ReferencesDanlos, Laurence Generation automatique detextes en langue naturelle, Masson, Paris,1985Derr, Marcia and McKeown Kathleen - Using focusto generate complex and simple sentences,COLING, 1984Kay, Martin - Parsing in functional unificationgrammar.
