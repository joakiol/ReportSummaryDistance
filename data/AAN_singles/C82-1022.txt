ISHIMOTO(Here as wel l  as in what fol lows intension wi l l  not be taken intoconsiderat ion.
The proposed Lesn iewsk ian theory wi l l  there forebe extens ional .
)Now it is to be remembered that 1 .11-1.51 are the formulas of(second-order)  predicate logic.
In other words,  the sentences ofnatura l  language are embedded in pred icate  logic a l though a largenumber of formulas of the logic do not have thei r  counterparts  innatura l  language.However,  the embedding in t rad i t iona l  pred icate  logic is notnecessar i ly  the only poss ib le  way for us to unders tand the logica ls t ructure of natural  language.
In fact, natura l  language could alsobe embedded in Lesn iewsk i ' s  onto logy augmented by a number of add-i t ional  not ions so that a f ragment of natura l  language can be ac-comodated there, and ~n what fol lows we shall  be concerned with adeta i led const ruct ion  of Lesn iewsk ian- type  logica l  grammar.2 Logica l  ~rammar  based upon Lesn iewsk i1~ onto logy In Lesniew-sk ian- type Montague grammar we are all the same star t ing from thest ructura l  assumpt ion  of the simple sentences of natura l  languageas ment ioned at the beg inn ing  of the last section.
Neverthe l@ss,in Lesn iewsk ian  vers ion of log ica l  grammar,  which wi l l  be abbre-v ia ted as LMG in the sequel,  Det, i.e.
determiners ,  are representednot by genera l i zed  quant i f iers  but by the functors of Lesn iewsk i ' sonto logy with noun and in t rans i t ive  verb phrases to be combinedthereby as two arguments,  which are now prov ided with the categoryof names in the sense of Lesn iewsk i ' s  onto logy,  not the one corres-ponding to monadic  pred icates  of predicate logic.Without  going into the detai ls  of the phrase st ructure andt rans format iona l  rules necessary  for generat ing  a f ragment of Eng-l ish (which is by far smal ler  than that proposed by Cooper -Parsons\[2\] ) we shal l  present  the deep or log ica l  structures of a number ofs imple sentences (of Engl ish) as (wel l - formed) sentences be long ingto the proposed Lesn iewsk ian  vers ion of Montague grammar to be de-~s ignated as LMG:2.11 ((the man) walk),2.12 ((every ((man or ) woman))  speak),2.13 ((some woman) not play)) ,2.14 ((every man) \[love (some woman)\] )2.15 (the woman) \[(love and) admire) \] '(every (boy ( or girl)\] l)2.16 (not ((every man) speak)),where \[ \] l  is a combinator  or operator  which makes an in t rans i t iveverb phrase out of a t rans i t ive  verb and a noun phrase.
This com-b inator  is represented  by a dec lens ion in in f lect iona l  languagessuch as Slavic ones, whi le  in the case of un in f lec ted  languages suchas Engl ish it is taken care of by word order.It is remarked that any combinator  could somet imes be app l iedfrom the left  to the r ight as suggested by Cresswel l  \[5\] ?
This hasa l ready been pract i sed  in som@ of the above sample sentences.
Thussuch sentences like:( (every man) \[(some (dog (or cat )) love\] 1 ),and((some woman) \[(some man)( love  not)\] 1 ),are also we l l - fo rmed,  be ing close to the word order usual  in Japa-nese.As is wel l  known, 2.14 has another  deep or log ica l  s t ructurein quant i f i ca t iona l  theory with 'some' hav ing the wider  scope than'every'.
In this case, the given sentence is of the form:( \[(every man) love\] 2 (some woman)) ,A LESNIEWSKIAN VERSION OF MONTAGUE GRAMMAR 141where \[ !2 combines a noun phrase and a t rans i t ive verb phrasegiving rlse to an expression corresponding to a monadic predicate.But, unl ike \[ \]l, the doun phrase to be combined is in the nom-inative case.The use of \[ \]2 wil l  be i l lustrated as follows:2.21 (\[(some man) hate\] 2 (every woman)),2.22 ((every woman) \[(some man) hate\]2),which are of the same structure with each other with 'some man' re-main ing the subject of these sentences.As fs easi ly understood from the development up to the present,the (wel l - formed) expressions of the proposed LMG as a logic are de-f ined in terms of the expressions both constant nnd var iable havingthe category of names in the sense of Lesniewski 's  ontology and re-lat ions as well  as of a number of logical  operators not only senten-tial and quant i f i cat iona l  but also name-for~ing and re lat ion-#orm-ing.
(For Lesniewski 's  ontology consult Iwanus \[5\], Luschei \[9\]and Slupecki  \[11\].
)3 Ax iomat izat ion of LMG as a logic ;w~ If we are to developLMG as a logic,we have to axiomatize it as a logical  system.Fortunate ly  the ax iomat izat ion of Lesniewski 's  ontology hasbeen intens ively  worked out ever since its single axiom was firstproposed by Lesniewski  h imsel f  in 1921.Thus, we are start ing with the ce lebrated single axiom origi-nat ing from Lesniewski :3.01 e(a, b) ~ .
(3x)e(x, a)~(x)(~(x, a)O ~(x, b))A(x) (y) (C(x ,  a )A  ?
(y, a ) .O  E(x, y)),or its s impl i f ied version by Soboeinski  \ [19  :3.o2 ~(a, b) ~ (~x)(~(x, a) ^ E(x, b))(x)(y)(~(x, a) A ~(y, a ) .D  ~(x, y)),where e stands for 'the' and a, b,... and ~he l ike are (meta-) log-ical var iables ranging over the expressions of the category of Les-n iewskian names.
On the other hand, e(a, b) stands for ((ea) b) or((a e) b) or (b (ea)) or (b (a e)), which are for thcoming as a re-sult of the l ibera l i zat ion due to Cresswel l  \[3\].
Analogously ,A(a, b) (l(a, b)) represents ((A a) b) etc.
((I a) b~ etc.)
withA (I) tak ing the place of 'every' ('some' ).
(A and I are alsoknown as sy l logist ic  funetors corresponding to 'every' and 'some'respect ively.
)Nevertheless,  3.01 or 3.02 is not enough to develop LMG as alanguage.
In fact, we need a number of addit ional  axiom (schemata)for tak ing care of name- and re lat ion- forming ( log ica l )operatorsand the express ions involv ing \[ \]1 and \[ \]2.The axiom (schemata) st ipulat ing these operators are wel l -known, being of the forms:3.11 e(a, b and c) 5 .E(a, b) A e(a, c),3.12 e(a, b or e) ~ .c(a, b) V e(a, c),3.21 e(a, not b) ~.e(a, a )A~e(a  , b),3.22 (R and S)(a, b) ~ .R(a, b) A S(a, b),3.23 (R or S)(a, b) ~ .R(a, b) V S(a, b),3.24 not R(a, b) ~ .e(a, a) A e(b, b )A~ R(a, b),3.25 en R(a, b) ~ R(b, a)3.26 R(a, b) ~ .e(a, a) A g(b, b),where in 3.26 R is atomic.
We are also abbrev iat ing  such expres-142 A.

The t rans la t ion  T 1 is de f ined  induct ive ly  on the num-ber  of  the  re la t ion - fo rming  operators  employed for de f in ing  theg iven  one.S tar t ing  w i th  the bas is :T 1 R = Ix lYGR(X  , y),where  G R is the (b inary)  re la t ion  (of the Dred icate  log ic )  cor res -pond ing  to the g ive a tomic  re la t ion  of  LMG, induct ion  steps are:T 1 H and S = Ix ly (T  l R(x,  y) A T, S(x,  y ) ) ,T I E or S = Ixly(Ti R(x, y) ~ T, S(x,  y)) ,T 1 not R = Ixly~Tl R(x , y) ,T 1 en E = IxlyTi R(y , x)(T1 R and S etc.

The induct ion stepsdo not present any dif f icult ies.In view of Lemmas ~.3 and h.h we obtain,Corol lary h.5 If a sentence of LMG as language is a thesis ofLMG as a logic, then its T - t ransform is provable in f i rst -order  pre-dicate logic with equality.It is remarked that the proof  of the T - t ransform of a sentencebe longing to LMG as a language might involve formulas not necessa-r i ly be longing to f i rst -order predicate logic.Last ly we wish to state without proof  a lemma of fundamentalimportance,  namely,Lemma h.6 If the T- t ransform of a sentence be long ing  to LMGas a language is provable in f i rst -order  predicate logic with equal-ity, then the sentence is a thesis of LMG as a logic.This is proved syntact ica l ly  as wel l  as semant ica l ly  by themethod employed in Ishimoto \[4\].Combin ing Coro l la ry  ~.5 and Lemma h.6 we obtain,~L Theorem ~.7 For every sentence ~ of LMC as a languageMG e iff T ~ is a thesis of f i rst -order predicate logic with equal-ty.In view of theorem h.7 as far as the logical  der ivabi l i ty  ofsome sentences of natural  language as speci f ied above is concerned,there is no di f ference between f i r s t -o rder  predicate logic and Les-n iewski 's  ontology.
Use wil l  be made , it is hoped, of this factin the var ious f ields ;e lated to the logical  analysis of naturallanguage.
