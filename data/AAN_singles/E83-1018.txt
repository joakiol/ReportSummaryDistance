Inour view syntax has two distinct roles in thisconnection: (i) to give impulses for assemblingcognitive representations, (ii) to structure thespace of search for fillers.
WEDNESDAY is aninterpreter for a language describing the lexiconand operating on natural language sentences.
Thesystem operates from left to right, interpretingthe various words comprising the sentence one at atime.
The basic ideas of the approach are thefollowing:a) to introduce into the lexicon linguisticknowledge that in other systems is in acentralized module.
The lexicon therefore carriesnot only morphological data and semanticdescriptions.
Also syntactic knowledge isdistributed throughout it, partly of a proceduralkind.b) to build progressively a cognitiverepresentation of the sentence in the form of asemantic network, in a global space, accessiblefrom all levels of the analysis.c) to introduce procedures invoked by the wordsthemselves for syntactic memory management.
Simplystated, these procedures decide on the opening,closing, and mantaining of search spaces; they usedetailed constraints and take into account theactive expectations.WEDNESDAY is implemented in MAGMA-LISP and with astress on the non-deterministic mechanism.I.
Parsing typologically diverselanguages emphasizes aspects that are absent or oflittle importance in English.
By taking theseproblems into account, some light may be shed on:a) insufficiently treated psycholinguistic aspectsb) a design which is less language-dependentc) extra- and non-grammatical aspects to be takeninto consideration in designing a friendly EnglishThe work reported here has largelyinvolved problems with parsing Italian.
One of thetypical features of Italian is a lower degree ofword order rigidity in sentences.
For instance,"Paolo ama Maria" (Paolo loves Maria) may berewritten without any significant difference inmeaning (leaving aside questions of context andpragmatics) in any the six possible permutations:Paolo ama Maria, Paolo Maria ama, Maria ama Paolo,Maria Paolo ama, ama Paolo Maria, ama Maria Paolo.Although Subject-Verb-Object is a statisticallyprevalent construction, all variations in wordorder can occur inside a component, and they maydepend on the particular words which are used.2.
In ATNSYS (Cappelli, Ferrari,Moretti, Prodanof and Stock, 1978), a previouslyconstructed ATN based system (Woods, 1970), aspecial dynamic reordering mechanism wasintroduced in order to get sooner to a correctsyntactic analysis, when parsing sentences of acoherent text (Ferrari and Stock, 1980).
Besidespsycholinguistic motivations, the main reason forthe introduction such heuristics lay in the largenumber of alternative arcs that has to beintroduced in networks for parsing Italiansentences.As a matter of fact, ATN's were notoriginally conceived for flexible word orderlanguages.
(In the extreme free word order case,an ATN would have one single node and a largenumber of looping arcs, losing itsmeaningfulness).Work has been done on ATN parsers forthe parsing of non-grammatical or extra-grammatical sentences in English, a problemrelated to our one.
For instance Weischedel andBlack (1981) have proposed a system of informationpassing in the case of parsing failure.
Kwasnyand Sondheimer (1981) have suggested therelaxation of constraints on the arcs undercertain circumstances.
Nevertheless, theseproblems, together with that of treatingidiosyncratic phenomena related to words andflexible idioms, are not easy to solve within theATN approach.At least two other parsers should bementioned here.106ELI (Riesbeck and Schank, 1976) derivesdirectly from the conceptual dependency approach.The result of the analysis is based on semanticprimitives, and the analysis is governed byconcept expectations.
The analyzer's non-determinism is in large part eliminated by worldknowledge consultation.
In practice, the (scanty)syntax is considered only later, in case ofdifficulty.The problem with this approach isrepresented by the difficulty in controlling casesof complex linguistic form.Small's Word Expert Parser (Small,1980) is an interesting attempt to assign anactive role to the lexicon.
The basic aspect ofparsing, according to Small's approach, isdisambiguation.
Words may have large numbers ofdifferent meanings.
Discrimination nets insertedin words indicate the paths to be followed in thesearch for the appropriate meaning.
Words aredefined as coroutines.
The control passes from oneword, whose execution is temporarily suspended, toanother one and so on, with reentering in asuspended word if an event occurs that can helpproceeding in the suspended word's discriminationnet.This approach too takes into littleaccount syntactic constraints, and thereforeimplies serious problems while analyzing complex,multiple clause sentences.It is interesting tc note that, thoughour approach was strictly parsing oriented fromthe outset, there are in it many similarities withconcepts developed independently in the Lexical-Functional Grammar linguistic theory (Kaplan &Bresnan, 1982).3.
A parser for flexible word orderlanguages must be substantially data driven.
Inour view syntax has two distinct roles in thisconnection- to give impulses for assembling cognitiverepresentations (basically impulses to search forfillers for gaps or substitutions to be performedin the representations)- to structure the space of search of fillers.WEDNESDAY, the system presented here,is an interpreter for a language describing thelexicon and operating on natural languagesentences.
The system operates from left to right,interpreting the various words comprising thesentence one at a time.The diagram for WEDNESDAY is shown inFig.

JFig.1a) to introduce into the lexiconlinguistic knowledge that in other systems is in acentralized module.
The lexicon therefore carriesnot only morphological data and semanticdescriptions.
Also syntactic knowledge isdistributed throughout it, partly of a proceduralkind.
In other words, though the system assigns afundamental role to syntax, it does not have aseparate component called "grammar".
By being fora large part bound to words, syntactic knowledgemakes it possible to specify the expectations thatwords bring along, and in what context whichconditions will have to be met by candidates tosatisfy them.
"Impulses", as they are called inWEDNESDAY to indicate their active role, result inconnecting nodes in the sentence cognitive memory.They may admit various alternative specifications,including also side-effects such as equi-nprecognition, signalling a particular required wordorder, etc.The advantages of this aspect ofWEDNESDAY include:- easy introduction of idiosyncratic properties ofwords;- possibility of dealing with various types ofnon-generative forms (idioms).b) to build progressively a cognitiverepresentation of the sentence in the form of asemantic network, in a global space, accessiblefrom all levels of the analysis.A word representation forms a shred ofnetwork that is later connected with other shredsuntil the complete network is formed.
Therepresentation we use is neutral enough tcguarantee that any changes in the format will not107cause serious problems to the analyzer.
Insubstance it can be seen as a propositional formatin Polish Prefixed notation:(Nx(P N I ... N i ... Nm))where N x is an instantation of predicate P, nodesN I ... N m are the variables, arguments of thatpredicate.
Some decompositional analysis isperformed, leading to a possible complex set ofpropositions for expressing the meaning of a word.c) to introduce procedures invoked bythe words themselves for syntactic memorymanagement.
Simply stated, these procedures decideon the opening, closing, and mantaining of searchspaces; they use detailed constraints and takeinto account the active expectations.
They are, asthe lexicon obviously is, dependent on theparticular language; nevertheless they refer togeneral primitive concepts.
The procedures can belooked upon as a redefinition of syntacticcategories in procedural terms, based on lowerlevel primitive functions.
This can be viewed as adifferent perspective on this aspect oflinguistics, traditionally considered in a staticand taxonomic way.allows:To manage structured spaces in this way- to maintain a syntactic control in the analysisof complex sentence- to keep an emphasis on the role played by thelexicon.Fig.2 shows a space management procedure,considering two space types, S and N.(,NOUN ()(S(COND((CANCLOSE)(NON-DET(T(CLOSESPACE)(~NOUN))((IS-EXPECTED N NS)(OPENSPACE N))))((OR(NOT(MAIN-ARRIVED))(IS-EXPECTED N NS))(OPENSPACE N))((FAIL))))(N(COND((CANCLOSE)(CLOSESPACE)(~NOUN)))))Fig.
2The following memories are used byWEDNESDAY:I) a SENTENCE COGNITIVE MEMORY in which semanticmaterial carried by the words is continuouslyadded and assembled.
This memory can be accessedat any stage of the parsing.2) a STRUCTURED SYNTACTIC MEMORY in which, atevery computational level:- the expectations defining the syntactic spaceare activated (e.g.
the expectation of a verb witha certain tense for a space S)the expectations of fillers to be merged withthe gap nodes are activated- the nodes capable of playing the role of fillersare memorizedthere are various local and contextualindications.4.
Impulses can be of two types.
AMERGE is an impulse to merge an explicitlyindicated node with another node that must satisfycertain constraints, under certain conditions.MERGE is therefore the basic network assemblingresource.
We use to characterize the node quotedin a MERGE impulse as a "gap" node, a node thatactually is merged with a gap node as a "filler"node.A MERGE impulse can state severalalternative specifications for finding a filler.The following are specified for eachalternative:a) an alt-condit, i.e.
a boolean predicateconcerned with possible flag raising occurringduring the process.b) a fillertype, i.e.
the syntactic characteristicof the possible filler.
A fillertype can be aheadlist (e.g.
N), or $$MAIN, indication of themain node of the current space, or $$SUBJ,indication of the subject of the current space.c) the indication of the values of the featuresthat must not be in contrast with thecorresponding features of the filler (i.e.
anunspecified value of the feature in the filler isok, a different value from the one specified isbad).
If the value of the feature in the filler isNIL, the value specified here will be assumed.d) a markvalue that must not be contrasted by themarkvalue of the fillere) sideffects caused by the merging of the nodes.These can be: SETFLAG, which raises a specifiedflag (that can subsequently alter the result of atest), REMFLAG, which removes a flag, and SUBSUBJ,which specifies the instantiation node and theordinal number of the relative argumentidentifying a node.
The subject of the subordinateclause (whose MAIN node will be actually fillingthe gap resulting from the present MERGE) will beimplicitly merged into the node specified inSUBSUBJ.
It should be noted that the latter mayalso be a gap node, in which case also after thepresent operation it will maintain thatcharacteristic.MARK is an impulse to stick a markvalue108onto a node.
If the chosen node has already amarkvalue, the new one will be forced in and willreplace it.MUST indicates that the current spacewill not be closed if the gap is not filled.
Notall gaps have a MUST: in fact in the resultingnetwork there is an indication of which nodesremain gaps.As mentioned before, the merging of twonodes is generally an act under non-deterministiccontrol: a non-deterministic point is establishedand the first attempt consists in making theproposed merging.
Another attempt will consist insimply not performing that merging.
A FIRSTspecification results in not establishing a non-deterministic point and simply merging the gapwith the first acceptable filler.By and large the internal structure ofgaps may be explained as follows.A gap has some information bound to it.More information is bound to subgaps, which areLISP atoms generated by interpreting thespecification of alternatives within a MERGEimpulse.
When an "interesting event" occurs thosesubgaps are awakened which "find the eventpromising".Subsequently, if one of the subgapsactually finds that a node can be merged with its"father" gap and that action is performed, thestate of the memories is changed in the followingway:- in the SENTENCE COGNITIVE MEMORY the mergingresults in substitution of the node and of inversepointers.- in the STRUCTURED SYNTACTIC MEMORY the gapentity is eliminated, together with the whole setof its subgaps.Furthermore if the filler was found ina headlist, it will be removed from there.Note that while the action in theSENTENCE COGNITIVE MEMORY is performedimmediately, the action in the STRUCTUREDSYNTACTIC MEMORY may occur later.One further significant aspect is thatwith the arrival of the MAIN all nodes present inheadlists must be merged.
If this does not happenthe present attempt will abort.5.
WEDNESDAY is implemented in MAGMA-LISP and with a stress on the non-deterministicmechanism.
Another version will be developed on aLisp Machine.WEDNESDAY can analyze fairly complex,ambiguous sentences yielding the alternativeinterpretations.
As an example consider thefollowing Zen-like sentence, that has a number ofdifferent interpretations in Italian:Ii saggio orientale dice allo studente di parlaretaeendoWEDNESDAY gives all (and only) thecorrect interpretations, two of which aredisplayed in Fig.3a and Fig.3b (in English words,more or less: "the eastern treatise advices thestudent to talk without words" and "the orientalwisemen silently informs the student that he (thewiseman) is talking").COGNITIVE NETWORK:C0000183:P-BE-SILENT X00OO175C0000180:P-GER EOOOO178 C0000183E0000178:P-TALK X0OOO175COOOO174:P-STUDENT XOOOO175COO00165:P-ADVISE XOO00076 EOOOO178 XOOOO175C0000119:P-EASTERN XOOOOO76COOO0075:P-TREATISE XOOOO076THREAD: C0000165(GAPS:).
