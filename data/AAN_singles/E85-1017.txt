Evenin this relatively simplified environment one doesnot normally undertake a linguistic analysis of anyscope.
In fact, syntactic and semantic analysishave been used in b ib l iograph ic  informationretrieval only under special circumstances toanalyze query phrases \[22\], to process structuredtext samples of a certain kind, \[7,15\], or finallyto process  texts  in  severe ly  res t r i c ted  top icareas.

Accordin E to the term discrimina-tion theory, the following criteria are of impor-tance i n  th i s  connect ion  \ [16 \ ] :a) te rms which occur  w i th  h igh  f requency  inthe  documents of a co l lec t ion  are  not  p re -fe r red  fo r  content  representat ion  becausesuch terms are  too broad  to  d i s t ingu ish  thedocuments from each o ther ;b) te rms which occur  w i th  very  low f requencyin  the  co l lec t ion  are  a l so  not  opt ima l ,because  such terms a f fec t  on ly  a very  smal lf rac t ion  of documents ;c) the  best  terms tend to be low-to-mediumf requency  ent i t ies  which can be produced bytaking single terms that exhibit therequired frequency characteristics; alter-natively, it is possible to obtain mediumfrequency entities by refining high fre-quency terms thereby rendering them morenarrow, or by broadening low frequencyterms.In many operational information situations,the term broadening and narrowing operations areeffectively carried out by using formulations inwhich the terms are connected by Boolean operators.The use of Boolean logic in retrieval is discussedin more detail in the remainder of this note.1162.
Extended Boolean Logic in Information RetrievalI t  i s  customary to express  in fo rmat ion  searchrequests  by us ing  Boolean fo rmulas  that  inc lude  theoperators  and,  o r ,  and no~.
Of par t i cu la r  in teres tin  a l ingu is t i c  context  are  the  and and or  opera -to rs :a)b)The and-operator  i s  a dev ice  fo r  spec i fy inga compulsory phrase  where a l l  terms in  theand-c lause  must be present  to  a f fec t  there t r ieva l  operat ion .
Thus a query s ta te -ment such as " in fo rmat ion  and re t r ieva l "  i sused to  represent  the compound nomina ls" in fo rmat ion  re t r ieva l " ,  or  " re t r ieva l  ofin fo rmat ion" .
The and-operator  i s  used asa re f in ing  dev ice  s ince  a broad term suchas " in fo rmat ion"  i s  made more spec l f l c  wheni t  i s  incorporated  in  an and-c lause .The or -operator ,  on the o ther  hand,  i s  adev ice  fo r  spec i fy ing  a group of  synonymouste rms,  or  a l te rnat ive ly ,  a thesaurus  c lassof terms in  which a l l  terms are  t reated  ascoequa l .
That i s ,  any one term in  an or -c lause  w i l l  cause re t r ieva l  of thecor respond ing  document,  and each term i sassumed to be as  good as any o ther  term.The or -operator  i s  a b roaden ing  dev icebecause each or -c lause  has a broader  scopethan  any ind iv idua l  c lause  component.Whi le the log ica l  operators  ,nd and or  a reused un iversa l ly  in  re t r ieva l  env i ronments ,  theassompt ions  of Boolean log ic  a re  not  ver i f ied  innormal text processing enviror..ents.
Strictsynonyms occur relatively rarely in query formula-tions or in the texts of documents, so that thenOrmal o r -c lause  does not  re f lec t  a pract i ca lsituation.
In fact, it should be possible to makedistinctions between more or less important termsin an or-clause; furthermore, or-clauses should beusable to represent collections of loosely relatedterms ins tead  of on ly  s t r i c t  synonyms, Ana lo -gous ly ,  i t  shou ld  be poss ib le  to  re lax  the  compul-sory nature  of the phrase  components inc luded in  an~&~-c lause ,  and d is t inc t ions  ought to be in t roduca-b le  between phrase  components of g reater  or  lesserimpor tance .In summary, the uncertain (fuzzy) nature ofthe term relationships which obtain in the naturallanguage are not reflected by the rules of ordinaryBoolean logic.
\[25\] Instead a relaxed type oflogic is needed which is capable of broadening ornarrowing the term units, while also providing fordistinctions in term importance and for the specif-ication of fuzzy or soft term relationships.
Suchan extended logical system was introduced recentlywith the following main properties: \[17-18\]a) The extended log ic  system d is t ingu ishesamong more or less  impor tant  terms in  bothguer ies  and documents by us ing  we ights ,  orimportance ind icators  a t tached to thete rms.
Thus ins tead  of terms A and B, thesystem processes  terms (A.a)  and (B,b)respect ive ly ,  where a and b des ignate  thewe ights  of terms A and B.b)c)d)The extended system simulates the llnguis-tic characteristics of more or less strictsynonyms, by attaching a ~-value to eachor-operator that specifies the degree ofstrictness of the corresponding operator.The higher the p-value attached to anoperator, the closer is the interpretationof that operator in accordance with therules of ordinary Boolean logic.
On theother hand, the smaller the p-value, themore relaxed is the interpretation of theor-operator.The extended system a lso  s imulates  thel ingu is t i c  character i s t i cs  of more or lesss t r i c t  phrase  a t tachment ,  by us in  E a p-va lue  fo r  each and-operator .

Cor respond ing ly ,  thesmal le r  the  p -va lue ,  the  more re laxed  i sthe  in terpretat ion  of the  and operator .The extended system (un l ike  the  ord inaryBoolean system) prov ides  ranked output  ofthe  s tored  documents in  presumed decreas ingorder  of impor tance  of a g iven  i tem wi threspect  to  a query .
In add i t ion ,  theextended system prov ides  much bet terre t r ieva l  output ,  than  systems based onconvent iona l  Boolean log ic .
Exper imen-ta l l y ,  improvements of 100 to 200 percentin  re t r ieva l  e f fec t iveness  have been notedfo r  the  extended log ic  over  the  conven-t iona l  Boolean system.
\ [17 ,18 \ ]It is not possible in the present context tofurnish the details of the operation of theextended logic system.
The following results are,however, relatively easy to prove: \[17\]a) When p -va lues  equa l  to  in f in i ty  a re  used,the  extended system produces  resu l t s  ident -i ca l  to  that  of the  convent iona l  Booleanlog ic  sys tems;b) When the p-values are reduced from infin-ity, the distinctions between phrase com-ponents (and) and synonym specification(or) become more and more blurred;c) When p reaches its lower limit of 1, thedistinction between and and or operators iscompletely lost.
and the system reduces thequeries (A and B) and (A or B) to a systemwith terms (A,B), without any relationshipspecification between terms A and B.Using linguistic analogues, the followingexamples illustrate the operations of the extendedlogic system.
The p-value attached to operators isshown in each case as an exponent:117i) (A andco B) i n te rpreted  as ALL OF (A,B) (strict phrase)iii (A and 3 B) interpreted as MOST OF (A,B) (fuzzy phrase)iii) (A and I B) interpreted as SET (A,B) (more matching terms are worth morethan fewer matching terms)iv) (A fl~ I B) identical to (A ~nd I B) interpreted as SET (A,B)v) (A ~ 3 B) interpreted as SOME OF (A,B) (fuzzy synonym)vi) (A ~ B) interpreted as ONE OF (A,B) (strict synonym)3.
Experimental ResultsThe operations of the extended logic systemare illustrated by using a collection of 3204 com-puter sc ience  ar t i c les  ( t i t les  and abst rac ts )  o r i -g ina l ly  pub l i shed  in  the  C~un icat ions  of the  ACM( the  CACM co l lec t ion) ,  and a co l lec t ion  of 1460ar t i c les  in  l ib rary  sc ience  obta ined  from theIns t i tu te  fo r  Sc ient i f i c  In fomat ion  ( the  CISI  co l -l ec t ion) .

\ [19\]The data  of  Tab le  1 ind icate  that  the  conven-t iona l  Boolean searches  (p = co, Boolean)  produceby fa r  the  wors t  per fo rmance  fo r  both  co l lec t ions .Per formance improvements between 100 and 200 per -cent  are  obta ined  by re lax ing  the  in terpretat ion  ofthe  Boolean operators  ( that  i s ,  by us ing  lower p-va lues) .
A d i s t inc t ion  must  be made between tak ingin to  account  on ly  s ing le  term matches  (p -va lues  areequa l  to 1) ,  and g iv ing  ext ra  we ight  to  term phrasematches  (A and B .rid .

The resu l t s  of Tab le  I show thatfo r  the  CACM quer ies  the  best  overa l l  po l i cy  i s  acomplete so f ten ing  of the  Boolean operators  down top = 1.
Ev ident ly  not  many of the  quas i -Boo leanphrases  inc luded in  the  CACM quer ies  were a l sopresent  in  the  document abst rac ts .
For the  IS Iquer ies ,  on the  o ther  hand,  154 percent  improvementi s  produced when p = 1; when the  phrase  combina-t ions  a re  g iven  ext ra  we ight ,  the  improvement inper formance jumps to 164 percent  fo r  p = 2, and to182 percent  when and-  and or -operatocs  a re  g ivendifferent values (p and = 2.5 and p or = 1.5,respectively).These phenomena are further illustrated in theoutput of Tables 2 and 3.
The comparison betweenquery CACM Q5 and Document 756 is outlined in Table2.
No abstract was available for document 756;hence only the title words could be used in thequery-document comparison.
As the  example shows.only the term "editing" was present in both docu-ment title and query.
This explains why the singleterm match (p = l) produces the best output rank of5 for this document.
Obviously, the sample docu-ment is not retrievable by the pure Boolean search(p = co) as demonstrated by the simulated retrievalrank of 1667 out of 3204 CACM documents.Table 3 shows an example where matchingphrases make a substantial difference in theretrieval results.
The matched phrases in Document1410 are given a double underline in Table 3,whereas matched single terms have a single under-line.
The output of Table 3 shows that when thes ing le  terms a lone  are  cons idered ,  document 1410 i sre t r ieved  w i th  a rank  of  53 in  response  to  queryIS I  Q33.
When the  phrase  matches  are  g iven  ext raweight (p = 2. or p and = 5, p or = 2), there t r ieva l  rank  improves to  2 and 7, respect ive ly .These resu l t s  demonst ra te  that  the  conven-t iona l  Boolean log ic  does not  adequate ly  re f lec tthe  tentat ive  and uncer ta in  nature  of the  re la t ionsbetween terms in  the  language.
When a re laxedin terpretat ion  of Boo lean log ic  i s  used,  thecorrespondence with the fuzzy nature of linguisticrelations is much greater and dramatic improvementsin term matching and hence retrieval effectivenessare obtained.4.
Relationship of Extended Boolean Model withOther Retrieval DevelopmentsThe extended Boolean system is based on theuse of certain term relationships--notably termphrases and synonymous constructions.
These rela-tions are.
however, interpreted flexibly, reflect-ing the uncertain nature of term relations in thelanguage.
Tn the extended system, soft Booleanqueries are easy to formulate, and methods existfor a completely automatic formulation of the softqueries, given only some basic information aboutuser needs .
\[20\] Analogously, initial queries maybe automatically reformulated, following an initialsearch operation, based on information obtainedfrom the user about the relevance of previouslyretrieved documents.
\[183The current development may then be related toother retrieval models that incorporate term rela-tions, and to systems with advanced user inter-faces.
Term relations of a statistical, or proba-bilistic nature are included in the probabilisticretrieval model; more general linguistic relationsare used in systems that include a natural languageanalyzer.
In the  probabilistic retrieval system,the documents are ranked in decreasing order of theprobabilistic expression p(x\[rel)/P(xlnonrel) whereP(x~rel) and P(x\[nonrel) represent the occurrenceprobabilities of an item x in the relevant and non-relevant document subsetso respectively.

orde~ term combz~ions.Unfortunately, the experiences accumulatedwith the probabilistic retrieval model show thatenough information is rarely available in practicalsituations to render possible an accurate estima-tion of the needed probabilities.
In practice, itthen becomes necessary to avoid the use of termdependencies by assuming that all terms occurindependently.
The probabilistic model is theneffectively equivalent to a vector processing sys-tem that does not include any term relations.

In particular, complexindexing units such as noun and prepositionalphrases might then be assigned to the informationitems for content representation, Unfortunately, acomplete treatment of noun phrases by automaticmeans remains elusive in view of the multiplicityof different term relations that are expressible bynoun and prepositional phrases.
An automaticrecognition of semantically equivalent noun phrasesof the kind needed for the construction of classif-ication schedules is also exceedingly difficult.For pract i ca l  purposes ,  the  use of term re la -t ions  that  is theoret i ca l ly  poss ib le  in the  proba-bilistic and language-based retrieval models is120thus of questionable help in general retrievalsituations where topic areas and linguistic com-plexities are not severely restricted.
The Booleanmodel which includes only a general pnrase (den, teaby the Boolean and) and a general synonym relation(denote~ by the Boolean ~tE) may not thereforerepresent an intolerable simplification when meas-ured against the realistically possible, alterna-tive methodo log ies .Considering now the user-system interfacesthat have been designed for use in informationretrieval, the following types ot development maybe distinguished.a) The use of minicomputer-based file access-ing methods providing simple access tospecific data bases, or to specific filecata logs .
Such systems are  o f ten  menu-dr iven  and o t fe r  a conversat iona l  s ty le ,permi t t ing  the  user  to consu l t  a g iven  termc lass i f i ca t ion  or thesaurus ,  and to  browsethrough the doc~ent  cor respond ing  to  ag iven  query fo rmulat ion .

\[8,9\]In each case the automatic interface system isdesigned to help the user to access a possiblyunfamiliar retrieval system and to pick a usefulsearch strategy.
The operational retrieval systemthat actually performs the searches is normally notmodified by the interface system.
The extendedBoolean system described in this note differs fromthese other developments because the conventionalsearch system is actually modified by replacing acomplete Boolean match by a fuzzy query-documentcomparison system.
Furthermore, the burden placedon the user during the query construction processis kept as small as possible.The minicomputer-based facilities and thefancy graphic di,play systems may be used in con-junction with the extended Boolean processing,since the two types of developments are somewhatindependent of each other, The same is true of thesystems that provide common interfaces to mulripledata bases.
The retrieval expert capable ofinteracting with the user in natural language maynot he usable in practical situations for someyears to come, unless severe restrictions areimposed on the topic areas under consideration, andthe freedom of formulating the search requests, Aninterface system of more limited scope may be moreeffective under current clrcumstances than theautomated ~expert" of the future.REFER~CES\[ I\] T.R.
