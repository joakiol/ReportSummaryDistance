Research and Development for Spoken Language SystemsVictor W. ZueSpoken Language Systems GroupLaboratory for Computer ScienceMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyOBJECTIVE:The goal of this research is to develop aspoken language system thatwill demonstrate the usefulness of voice input for interactive problem solving.
The systemwill accept continuous speech, and will handle multiple speakers without explicit speaker enroll-ment.
Combining SUMMrr, a segment-based speech recognition system, and TINA, a probabilisticnatural language system, to achieve speech understanding, the system will be demonstrated in anapplication domain relevant to the DoD.SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS:?
Improved the performance and expanded the capabilities ofthe VOYAGER urban explorationand navigation system.
Specifically:- incorporated an N-best interface between speech recognition and natural languageprocessing,- expanded the coverage of the natural language component and the back-end, and- ported VOYAGER tO a Sun workstation with a set of commercially available DSP boards,pipelined the computation, and reduced the computation time to approximately 5 timesreal-time.Developed a mechanism for automatically generating tasks in the VOYAGER framework topromote interactive problem solving by users, thus enabling us to collect spontaneous speechfrom users in a goal-directed mode,Performed acoustic and linguistic analysis on nearly 3,000 sentences, contrasting the differ-ences between read and spontaneous speech.Developed the initial version of ATIS, collected pilot data, and participated in the first roundof common evaluation.PLANS:?
Improve the speech recognition performance by incorporating context-dependency i  pho-netic modelling.?
Fully integrate TINA and SUMMIT in order to exploit speech and natural language symbiosis.?
Continue to increase and improve the knowledge base of  VOYAGER, SO that correct and naturalresponses can be generated.?
Collect additional speech and text data dunng actual problem solving for system developmentand evaluation, and continue to evaluate the performance of VOYAGER.?
Port SUMMIT tO the ATIS task, and perform overall system evaluation.?
Continue hardware development, such that the system will soon be able to run in nearreal-time.418
