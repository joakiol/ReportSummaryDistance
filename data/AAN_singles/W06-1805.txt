We showhow it can be implemented in descriptionlogic and illustrate the predictions madeby a series of examples.
The proposal hasbeen implemented using Description logicas a semantic representation language andthe prediction verified using the DL theo-rem prover RACER.Topics: Textual Entailment, Adjectival Semantics1 IntroductionUnderstanding a text is one of the ultimate goalsof computational linguistics.
To achieve this goal,systems need to be developed which can constructa meaning representation for any given text andwhich furthermore, can reason about the meaningof a text.
As is convincingly argued in (Ido Daganand Magnini, 2005), one of the major inferencetask involved in that reasoning is the entailmentrecognition task:Does text T1 entail text T2?Indeed entailment recognition can be used todetermine whether a text fragment answers aquestion (e.g., in question answering application),whether a query is entailed by a relevant document(in information retrieval), whether a text fragmententails a specific information nugget (in informa-tion extraction), etc.Because the Pascal RTE challenge focuses onreal text, the participating systems must be robustthat is, they must be able to handle unconstrained?We thank la Re?gion Lorraine, INRIA and the Universityof Sarrebruecken for partially funding the research presentedin this paper.input.
Most systems therefore are based on sta-tistical methods (e.g., stochastic parsing and lex-ical distance or word overlap for semantic simi-larity) and few provide for a principled integra-tion of lexical and compositional semantics.
Onthe other hand, one of the participant teams hasshown that roughly 50% of the RTE cases couldbe handled correctly by a system that would ade-quately cover semantic entailments that are eithersyntax based (e.g., active/passive) or lexical se-mantics based (e.g., bicycle/bike).
Given that theoverall system accuracies hovered between 50 and60 percent with a baseline of 50 %1, this suggeststhat a better integration of syntax, compositionaland lexical semantics might improve entailmentrecognition accuracy.In this paper, we consider the case of adjectivesand, building on approaches like those describedin (Raskin and Nirenburg, 1995; Peters and Pe-ters, 2000), we propose a classification of adjec-tives which can account for the entailment patternsthat are supported by the interaction of their lexi-cal and of their compositional semantics.
We startby defining a classification schema for adjectivesbased on their syntactic and semantic properties.We then associate with each class a set of axiomsschemas which translate the knowledge about lex-ical relations (i.e.
antonymy) the adjectives of theclass are involved in by extracting this informationfrom WordNet (Miller, 1998) and a set of seman-tic construction rules and we show that these cor-rectly predicts the observed entailment patterns.For instance, the approach will account for the fol-lowing (non)-entailment cases:(1) a. John frightened the child|= The child is afraid150% of the cases were true entailment and 50% werefalse ones, hence tossing a coin would get half of the casesright.20 KRAQ06b.
Peter claims that John is a murderer|= John is an alledged murderer6|= John is a murdererc.
This is a fake bicycle|= This is a false bike|= This is not a real bike6|= This is a biked.
John is not awake|= John sleeps6|= John does not sleepThe approach is implemented using DescriptionLogic as a semantic representation language andtested on a hand-built semantic test suite of ap-proximately 1 000 items.
In the latter part of thepaper we discuss this testsuite and the philosophybehind it.2 A fine grained classification foradjectivesAs mentioned above, we propose a classificationof adjectives based on their lexical, their modeltheoretic and their morpho-derivational properties.To facilitate the link with compositional semantics(the construction of a meaning representation forsentences containing adjectives), we also take intoaccount syntactic properties such as the predica-tive/attributive or the static/dynamic distinction.We now detail each of these properties.
The over-all categorisation system is given in Figure 1.2.1 Model theoretic propertiesThe main criteria for classification are given by(Kamp, 1975; Kamp and Partee, 1995) seman-tic classification of adjectives which is based onwhether it is possible to infer from the Adj+Ncombination the Adj or the N denotation.Intersective adjectives (e.g., red) licence thefollowing inference inference patterns:A + N |= AA + N |= NFor instance, if X is a red car then X is a car andX is redSubsective adjectives (e.g., big) licence thefollowing inference pattern:A + N |= NFor instance, if X is a big mouse, then X is a mousebut it is not necessarily true X is bigPrivative adjectives licence the inference pattern:A + N |= ?NFor instance, if X is a fake gun then X is not a gunPlain non-subsective adjectives (e.g., alledged)do not licence any inferenceFor instance, if X is an alleged murderer then it isunknown whether X is a murderer or not2.2 Lexical semanticsFrom the lexical semantics literature, we takeone additional classification criterion namelyantonymy.
As described in (Cruse, 1986), thisterm covers different kinds of opposite polarity re-lations between adjectives namly, binary opposi-tion, contraries and multiple oppositions.Binary oppositions covers pairs such as wet/drywhich license the following inference pattern:A1 ?
?A2 ?
?A1 ?
A2So that in particular:wet ?
?dry ?
?wet ?
dryContraries are pairs such as long/short where theimplication is unidirectional:A1 |= ?A2 ?
?A1 6|= A2A2 |= ?A1 ?
?A2 6|= A1and in particular:long |= ?short ?
?long 6|= shortshort |= ?long ?
?short 6|= longMultiple oppositions involve a finite set of adjec-tives (e.g., linguistic/economic/mathematical/... )which are pairwise mutually exclusive.
For a setof opposed adjectives A1 .

An, the following ax-ioms schemas will be licensed:?i, j s.t.

i, j ?
and i 6= jAi |= ?Aj and ?Ai 6|= Aj2.2.1 Derivational morphologyWe also take into account related forms that is,whether there exists a verb (Va) or a noun that issemantically related to the adjectives being con-sidered.
Moreover, for nominalizations we distin-guish whether the morphologically related noun isan event noun (Ne), a noun denoting a theta roleof the related verb (N?)
or a non-event noun (Na).As we shall see, this permits capturing entail-ment relations between sentences containing mor-phoderivational variants such as for instance :21 KRAQ06(2) a. John is asleep (Adj ?
Va)|= John sleepsb.
John is absent (Adj ?
N?
)|= John is the absenteec.
John is deeply asleep (Adj ?
Ne)|= John?s sleep is deep2.2.2 Syntactic propertiesTo better support the syntax/semantic interface,we refine the adjectives classes distinguishable onthe basis of the above criteria with the followingsyntactic ones taken from (Quirk et al, 1985).Attributiveness/Predicativeness.
English adjec-tives can be divided in adjectives which can beused only predicatively (such as alone), adjectiveswhich can be used only attributively (such as me-chanical in mechanical enginner) and adjectiveswhich can be used in both constructions such asred.Modifiability by very.
We distinguish betweenadjectives such as nice which can be modified byvery (i.e.
very nice) and adjectives such as allegedwhich cannot (*very alleged).Gradability.
We distinguish between adjectivessuch as big which express gradable properties andhave comparative and superlative forms (bigger,biggest) and adjectives such as rectangular whichdon?t (*more rectangular).Staticity/Dynamicity.
Dynamic adjectives can beused in imperative constructions and in the pro-gressive form (Be reasonable, He is being reason-able), static adjectives cannot (*Be short, He is be-ing short).3 Semantic Classes and textualentailment recognitionIn order to build our classification, we have anal-ysed a set of about 300 english adjectives eachof which was manually mapped to the WordNetsynset correspondent to the more frequent mean-ing of the adjective.
In some case, when an ad-jective presents polysemic forms which belong todifferent semantic classes more than one form hasbeen considered.
For example, for the adjectivecivil we consider two senses/forms civil1 (syn-onym of polite, as in civil man) and civil2 (as incivil engineer) which belong to different semanticclasses, the first being intersective and the secondsubsective.
As Figure 1 shows, the proposed clas-sification includes 15 adjective classes, each withdistinct syntactic and semantic properties.To account for these differences, we define foreach class a set of axiom schemas capturing themodel theoretic, lexical semantics and morpho-derivational properties of that class.
Lexical se-mantics and morpho-derivational information arederived from WordNet.
For example, the axiomsdescribing antonymy are obtained by extractingfrom WordNet the antonyms of a particular adjec-tive and then by considering the direction of theentailment relevant for the class the adjective be-longs to:asleep ?
wake vs. polite <rudeMorpho-derivational information are derived fromWordNet by extracting the derivationally relatedforms for the given adjective and then iterating theextraction on nouns and verbs in order to obtaininformation about their antonyms and hyponyms.For scalar adjective like tall, WordNet containsalso a relation is a value of which offers apointer to the noun concept the adjective is a valueof.
Moreover, WordNet links the noun concept toa list of attributes which describe the scalar prop-erty it represents.
For example, the adjective tallis a value of {stature,height} and attributesof {stature,height} are tall and short.Based on some basic syntactic patterns, we thenshow that these axioms predict the observed tex-tual entailment patterns for that class.Before we illustrate this approach by means ofsome example, we first show how we capture log-ical entailment between NL semantic representa-tions in a description logic setting.3.1 Using description logic to checkentailment between NL sentencesAs argued in (Gardent and Jacquey, 2003), de-scription logic (DL) is an intuitive frameworkwithin which to perform lexical reasoning: it isefficient (basic versions of description logics aredecidable), it is tailored to reason about complextaxonomies (taxonomies of descriptions) and itis equipped with powerful, freely available auto-mated provers (such as RACER, (Volker Haarslev,2001)).
For these reasons, we are here exploring aDL encoding of the entailment recognition task forthe set of examples we are considering.The partic-ular language we assume has the following syntax.C, D ?
A|>|?|?A | C u D | C unionsq D | ?R.C | ?R.CThe semantics of this language is given below with?

RIn}Now one basic problem with using DL to checkentailment between NL expressions, is that DLformulae are ?directional?
in that they refer to agiven set of individuals.
For instance the sentenceThe boat is floating might be represented by eitherof the two formulae given in 3 but these two for-mulae do not stand in an entailment relation (sincethey refer to different kind of objects namely float-ing event of a boat in 3a and boats that float in 3b).
(3) a. float u?theme.boatb.
boat u?theme?1.floatTo remedy this shortcoming, we introduce thenotion of a rotation.
Given a DL formula whichonly contains conjunction (disjunction is trans-lated in DL as different formulas)?
= ui=1,n Eventi uj=1,m ?Rj .Typeja rotation of this formula is defined as:1.
?2.
?j ?
{1, ..., m} :Typej u ?R?1j .
(ui=1,nEventi u1<k<j,j<k<m?Rk.Typek)so that the formula:Event1u Event2 u ...u Eventn u?R1.Type1 u?R2.Type2 ...u?Rn.Typencorresponds to the following n Rotations each ofwhich describe the same situation from the pointof view of a particular type0.

(Event u?R1.Type1 ... u?Rn.Typen)?
Type2...n. Typen u?R?1n .
(Event u?R1.Type1 ... u?Rn?1.Typen?1)?
TypenSo for example, the sentence Mary knows thatJohn is the inventor of the radio will be repre-sented as a predicate logic formula?x1mary(x1) ?
?x2john(x2) ?
?x3radio(x3) ?
?e1know(e1) ?
?agent(e1, x1)?
?topic(e1 , e2)?
?e2invent(e2)?agent(e2 , x2)?patient(e2 , x3)the denotation of this PL formula corresponds tothe set of individuals {x1, x2, x3} ?
{e1, e2}.
Thecorresponding DL representation will be the un-derspecified representationknow u?
agent.mary u?

( invent u?agent.john u?
pa-tient.radio)the denotation of which corresponds to the set{e1} and all its rotations which permit to accessthe other sets of individuals asserted in the sen-tence.
Thus for example, the set {x1} whichdescribes the individual Mary can be accessedthrough the following rotation:Rotation1: mary u?
agent?1.
(know u?
topic.
( inventu?agent.john u?
patient.radio))Finally, we say that an arbitrary for-mula/representation ?1 implies the formula?2 iff it is possible to find a rotation Rotationi of?1 the denotation of which describes a subset ofthe denotation of ?2:Definition?1 |= ?2 iff ?i.Rotationi(?1) v ?2 (1)23 KRAQ063.2 Example class axioms and derivationsWe now illustrate our approach by looking at twoclasses in more detail namely, class 1 and class 8.3.2.1 Class 1Syntactically, Class 1 contains adjectives likeadrift,afloat,aground which can only be used pred-icatively, are non gradable and cannot be modifiedby very.
Semantically, they behave like intersec-tive adjectives which enter in multiple oppositionrelations with other adjectives.
They are further-more morphologically derived from verbs and canbe nominalized.
To reflect these semantic proper-ties we use the following axioms.Model theoretic semantics.
Adjectives of class1 are intersective adjective.
They will thus li-cence the correponding inference patterns namely:A + N |= A (2)A + N |= N (3)Lexical semantics.
Adjectives of class 1 enter inmultiple opposition relations.
Hence For instance:afloat |= ?

afloat 6|= agroundaground |= ?
afloat ??
aground 6|= afloatsunken |= ?
afloat ??
afloat 6|= sunkenafloat |= ?
sunken ??
sunken 6|= afloatMorpho-derivational semantics.
Adjectives inClass 1 can be related to both nouns and verbs.Thus, for example the adjective afloat in WordNetis related to the noun floating which is related tothe verb float, by assuming that the semantics as-signed to the verb float is float(e), theme(e,a), theadjective afloat is assigned the following seman-tics:afloat ?

Semantically, they are classifiedas subsective adjectives and their antonyms arecontraries.
They are morphologically relatedto nouns which describe the particular propertydenoted by the adjectives and to nouns of whichthey are attributes.Model theoretic semantics.
Adjectives ofclass 8 are subsective adjective.
They will thus li-cence the correponding inference patterns namely:A + N 6|= A (4)A + N |= N (5)Lexical semantics.
The Adjectives of class 8 en-ter in contrary opposition relations.
Hence, the fol-lowing axioms schemas will be licensed:Ai |= ?Anto(Ai) and ?Ai 6|= Anto(Ai)(6)For instance:long |= ?
small ??
long 6|= smalldeep |= ?
shallow ??
deep 6|= shallowMorpho-derivational semantics.
Adjectives inClass 8 can be related to nouns but not toverbs.
Moreover, such adjectives are mappedin WordNet to noun concepts through two dif-ferent links: derivationally related toand is a value of.
For example, the adjec-tive tall in WordNet is derivationally related to thenoun tallness and is a value of the concept nounheight.
The adjectives in this class describe grad-able properties so that their semantics correspondsto:has-property(Related Noun u?has-measure.Top)in which the role has-measure account for thevalue of the scalar property described by the adjec-tive, which remain underspecified (Top) if the ad-jective is used without a reference to the value ofmeasure.
When the value of the measure is speci-fied, for example by combining the adjective witha noun, as for example in This is a tall man, thenthe noun is assigned as a value of the measure role:man u?has-property.
(tallnessu?has-measure.man)which translate This is tall as a man.This is encoded in the following axiomschemas:MDR 1.

We arecurrently working on developing such an anal-yser within a symbolic grammar framework.
Wehave also started to develop an evaluation testsuite geared towards entailment recognition be-tween sentence pairs containing adjectives.
At themoment, the test suite contains about 1 000 infer-ence pairs.
Each item in the TestSuite (see fig.
2)is annotated with a judgement about the truth ofthe entailment between the pair of sentences, withthe type of inference involved and with the speci-fication of adjective involved.
Moreover, each ad-jective is annotated with the WordNet sense corre-sponding to the given class.The idea behind this test suite is similar tothat underlying the creation of the TSNLP (Testsuite for natural language processing) (see (Oepenand Netter, 1995)) or the Eurotra testsuites (see(Arnold and des Tombe, 1987)) namely, to pro-vide a benchmark against which to evaluate andcompare existing semantic analyzers.
Thus this26 KRAQ06<pair id="1" value="TRUE" class="[CLASS1]" inference="Adj/Verb"><t>The boat is <sn n="1"> afloat </sn>.</t><h>The boat is floating.</h></pair><pair id="2" value="FALSE" class="[CLASS6]" inference="Antonymy"><t>This is not a <sn n="1"> rectangular </sn> table.</t><h>This is a <sn n="1"> round </sn> table </h></pair><pair id="3" value="TRUE" class="[CLASS8]" inference="Adj/Noun"><t>The line is 2 meter <sn n="1"> long </sn>.</t><h>The length of the line is 2 meter.</h></pair><pair id="4" value="FALSE" class "[subs/intersective]" inference="Attr/Pred"><t>The treasurer is <sn n="2"> present </sn>.</t><h>This is the <sn n="1"> present </sn> treasurer.</h></pair>Figure 2: TestSuitetest suite illustrates the semantic and syntactic be-haviour of adjectives and their related verbs/nounswith respect to textual entailment.
One couldimagine other test suites illustrating the seman-tic behaviour of verbs, of quantifiers, of discourseconnectives, etc.
Just as the TSNLP still provesuseful in supporting the development of new sym-bolic parsers/grammars, hand built test suites ofartificial examples might prove useful in improv-ing the accuracy of semantic analyser wrt textualentailment.
Indeed the Pascal RTE challenge hasshown that existing systems fares rather poortly atthe textual entailment task.
Providing a set of handcrafted semantic test suites might help in remedy-ing this shortcoming.Beside implementing and evaluating the anal-ysis of adjectives presented in this paper, we arealso working on refining this analysis by combin-ing it with a detailed analysis of noun semantics soas to handle (non) entailments such as:(9)Lyon is the gastronomical capital of France6|= Lyon is the capital of FranceReferencesD.J.
