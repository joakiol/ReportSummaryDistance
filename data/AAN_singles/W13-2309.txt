In this work, we annotate both discourse relation and sentiment information on a moderate-sized Chinese corpus extracted from the ClueWeb09.
Based on the annota-tion, we investigate the association between the relation type and the sentiment polarity in Chinese and interpret the data from various aspects.
Finally, we highlight some language phenomena and give some remarks.
1 Introduction A discourse relation indicates how two argu-ments (i.e., elementary discourse units) cohere to each other.
Various discourse relations were de-fined according to different taxonomy (Carlson and Marcu, 2001; Carlson et al 2002; Prasad et al 2008).
In the work of the Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 annotation, Prasad et al(2008) labeled four grammatical classes of connectives in English, including subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, adverbial connectives, and implicit connectives.
Besides, the sense of each connective was also tagged.
They defined three levels of sense hierarchy for the connec-tives.
The four classes on the top level are Tem-poral, Contingency, Comparison, and Expansion.
There are explicit and implicit uses of dis-course relations.
An explicit discourse relation indicates the arguments are connected with an overt discourse marker (i.e., connective).
A con-nective joins two discourse units such as phrases, clauses, or sentences together.
For example, the word however is a common connective that indi-cates a Comparison relation between two argu-ments.
The sense of a discourse marker denotes how its two arguments cohere.
In other words, adiscourse marker presents the relation of its two arguments.
In other cases, discourse marker is absent from an implicit relation.
However, readers can still infer the relation from its argument pair.
To re-solve implicit discourse relations, i.e., without the information from discourse markers, is more challenging (Lin et al 2009; Zhou et al 2010).
Hutchinson (2004) pointed out the properties of a discourse marker from three dimensions, including polarity, veridicality, and type.
The polarity of a discourse marker indicates the sen-timent transition of its two arguments.
Veridi-cality, the second dimension of a discourse marker, specifies whether both the two argu-ments are true or not.
Type, similar to the sense which is annotated in the PDTB, is the third di-mension of a discourse marker.
Our previous work (Huang and Chen, 2012a; Huang and Chen, 2012b) addressed the interac-tion between the sentiment polarity and the dis-course structure in Chinese.
Consider (S1), which consists of three clauses and forms a nest-ed discourse structure shown in Figure 1.
(S1) ???????????????????????????????
(Although the management office tried to make the Yang-mingshan area a more natural environment as the long-term garden of Taipei)???????????????
(but due to the two-day weekend and the improved economic conditions)???????????????????
(the is-sues of tourist parking, garbage, and other indi-rect effects become more serious)?
The second and the third clauses form a Con-tingency relation with a sentiment polarity transi-tion from Positive to Negative.
Furthermore,70Figure 1: Discourse structure and sentiment po-larities of (S1).
these two clauses also constitute one of the ar-guments of a Positive-Negative Comparison rela-tion.
As the PDTB 2.0 annotation manual sug-gests (Prasad, et al 2007), a Comparison rela-tion is established to emphasize the differences between two arguments.
Therefore, it is expected that the two arguments of a Comparison relation are relatively likely to have the opposing polarity states (i.e., Positive-Negative or Negative-Positive).
On the other hand, the two arguments of an Expansion relation are relatively likely to belong to the same polarity states (e.g., Positive-Positive or Neutral-Neutral).
Discourse relation recognition (Hernault et al 2010; Soricut and Marcu, 2003) and sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008) have attracted much attention recently.
Due to the limitation of the resources, the research on Chinese discourse relation analysis is relatively rare.
In our previ-ous work, we annotated a collection of Chinese discourse corpora, namely NTU Chinese Dis-course Resources (http://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ntu-discourse/), for inter-sentential and intra-sentential discourse relation recognition (Huang and Chen, 2011; Huang and Chen, 2012a).
How-ever, no sentiment information is labeled in these corpora.
In another work (Huang and Chen, 2012b), we proposed an annotation scheme to construct a Chinese discourse corpus with rich information including sentiment polarities, but the corpus is still under construction due to its complexity.
Zhou and Xue (2012) did PDTB-style Chinese discourse corpus annotation, but the corpus is also not available yet.
In this paper, we annotate a moderate-sized Chinese corpus with the information of discourse relations and sentiment polarities.
Total 7,638 sentences are sampled from the ClueWeb09.
We review the results of annotation and analyze some language phenomena found in the corpus.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we introduce the ClueWeb corpusand a dictionary of Chinese discourse markers.
In Section 3, the criteria to sample instances and the annotation scheme are shown.
We analyze the language phenomena found in the annotated data and discuss the correlation between discourse relations and sentiment polarities in Section 4.
Finally, we conclude the remarks in Section 5.
2 Linguistic Resources The PDTB is a popular dataset used in the Eng-lish discourse research.
In contrast, no Chinese discourse corpus is publicly available at present.
To construct a Chinese discourse corpus, we sample instances from a huge Chinese corpus (Yu et al 2012).
This corpus was developed based on the ClueWeb09 dataset, where Chinese material is the second largest.
It contains a total of 9,598,430,559 POS-tagged sentences in 172,298,866 documents.
In this paper, only the explicit discourse rela-tions are concerned.
A dictionary of discourse markers is consulted to extract the instances of explicit discourse relations from the ClueWeb.
This Chinese discourse marker dictionary is de-veloped based on Cheng and Tian (1989), Cheng (2006) and Lu (2007).
Table 1 shows an over-view of the discourse marker dictionary.
It con-tains 808 words and word pairs mapped into the PDTB four top-level classes (Cheng and Tian, 1989; Wolf and Gibson, 2005).
Besides the types of discourse relations, we further classify the markers into three groups of scopes shown in the second column, including Single word, Intra-sentential, and Inter-sentential, according to their grammatical usages.
The Single word group con-tains those individual words used as discourse markers.
The Intra-sentential group contains pairs of words that occur inside the same senten-ce and denote a discourse relation.
Here, a Chi-nese sentence is defined as a sequence of succes-sive words that is ended by a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark.
The clauses of a sentence are delimited by commas.
The Inter-sentential discourse markers are similar to the Intra-sentential ones, but the two words of a pair individually appear in different sentences.
Some discourse markers can be used as both Inter-sentential and Intra-sentential.
In this work, the Inter-sentential only discourse markers are ex-cluded because we only concern the discourse relation occurring within a sentence.
The third column lists the number of discourse markers for each scope under each PDTB class, and the fourth column gives some examples.71PDTB Class Scope # Markers ExamplesExpansionSingle word 177 ??

3 Annotation Based on the Chinese part of the ClueWeb09 (Yu et al 2012), we sample a moderate-sized data with some criteria and annotate them with the information of discourse relations and sentiment polarities.
3.1 Sampling a reliable dataset Discourse relations may be explicit or implicit, and a sentence may contain more than one dis-course marker.
Multiple discourse relations oc-curring in a sentence will make the annotation more complex.
In this work, we focus on the cor-relation between discourse relations and senti-ment polarity.
To get a reliable dataset for analy-sis, we sample sentences based on the following three criteria.
1.
A sentence should contain only two clauses.
2.
A sentence should contain exact one dis-course marker shown in the Chinese discourse marker dictionary.
We match the discourse marker on the word level.
For the Single word markers, the marker can appear in either of the clauses.
For the pairwise markers, the first word should appear in the first clause, and the second word should appear in the second one.
3.
The lengths of both clauses in a sentence are no more than 20 Chinese characters.
As shown in Figure 1, the sentiment polarity determination is more challenging when more than one discourse relation is involved in a sen-tence.
In order to facilitate the analysis, we focus on those sentences that contain exact one dis-course marker.
The limitation of clause length is also applied to avoid the noise from implicit dis-course relation.
Based on a preliminary statistics, we find that most clauses in the Chinese part of the ClueWeb (Yu et al 2012) are no longer than 20 Chinese characters shown in Figure 2.Figure 2: Length distribution in the ClueWeb.
3.2 Annotation scheme Using the criteria described in Section 3.1, total 7,638 instances are randomly selected from the ClueWeb, and 87 native speakers annotate these instances.
Each instance is shown to three anno-tators.
The annotator labels the polarities of the first clause, the second clause, and the whole in-stance with Negative, Neutral, and Positive.
In addition, the discourse relation between the two clauses is also labeled with Temporal, Contin-gency, Comparison, and Expansion.
For each target sentence, the annotation is based on the information from the sentence only.
The sen-tences are not given to annotators.
Finally, the majority of each label is taken.
For example, the72polarity p1 of the first clause in the instance (S2) is labeled as Positive, the polarity p2 of the sec-ond clause is labeled as Negative, the resulting polarity pw of the whole sentence is also labeled as Negative, and the discourse relation between the two clauses is labeled as Comparison.
(S2) ????????????????????
(Although French brand cars share more than half of the domestic market share)??????????
(but the market share con-tinued to shrink)?
The inter-agreements of p1, p2, pw, and dis-course relation among annotators are 0.49, 0.50, 0.47, and 0.41 in Fleiss?
Kappa values, respec-tively (all are moderate agreement).
The result-ing corpus is publicly available on the website of NTU Chinese Discourse Resources1.
4 Results and Discussion To investigate the corpus annotated with dis-course relation and sentiment polarity, we firstly give an overview of results with respect to these two types of linguistic phenomena.
And then, the most frequent discourse markers for each class of discourse relations are discussed.
Finally, we reorganize the results to several aspects and dis-cuss the association between discourse relations and sentiment polarities.
4.1 Overview of the annotated corpus The distribution of the discourse relations versus the polarities of whole sentence (pw) is shown in Table 2.
Compared to the distributions of dis-course relations in the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al 2008) shown in Table 3, the ex-plicit Chinese discourse corpus is more similar to the whole English corpus.
The instances of Ex-pansion form the largest set among four dis-course relation classes.
In Chinese, the instances of Expansion are even more.
Temporal is the most infrequent relation which has close fre-quencies in both corpora.
The different charac-teristic is the frequency of Comparison relation.
In our Chinese corpus, the frequency of Compar-ison relation is about half of that in the PDTB.
In Table 2, the symbol ?
is used to highlight the relatively major polarity of each relation.
The symbol ?
is marked when the polarity is the ma-jority (i.e., with a frequency greater than 50%).
Near half (49.11%) of the instances belong to Neutral.
Neutral statements are major in Tem-                                                1 http://nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ntu-discourse/poral and Expansion classes.
On the other hand, Comparison is the relation which is most in-volved in expressing sentiment, negative senti-ment in particular.
Contingency is second to Comparison in expressing sentiment.
The distribution of the discourse relations ver-sus (p1, p2), the sentiment polarity transitions be-tween two clauses, is shown in Table 4.
Neutral-Neutral is the most frequent polarity transition in all relations.
More than half of the Temporal in-stances are Neutral-Neutral.
The reason may be that the Temporal relations are usually used in the sentences that describe the objective facts of the past, present, or the future.
In such sentences, the sentiments are relatively rare.
On the other hand, the sentences of Comparison and Contin-gency occur more in the critical and analytical scenarios.
Although the most frequent transition of Com-parison is also Neutral-Neutral (23.14%), the other three types of transitions, Positive-Negative, Neutral-Negative, and Negative-Positive, have close frequencies of 22.71%, 16.90%, and 15.72%, respectively.
Moreover, Negative polar-ity is involved in all these three transitions in one of their clauses.
The relations between p1, p2, and pw are also interesting.
Table 5 shows the top 10 most fre-quent correlations of the polarities (p1, p2, pw) of the first clause, the second clause, and the whole sentence.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that most instances belong to (Neutral, Neutral, Neutral).
On the other hand, it is worthy of not-ing that p2 and pw are identical in the top eight types of combinations in Table 5.
In other words, the resulting sentiment polarity of a two-clause sentence is mostly consistent with the polarity of   Relation # % Neu  (%) Pos  (%) Neg  (%) Temporal 849 11.12 ?60.66 22.38 16.96 Contingency 1,598 20.92 ?44.74 26.97 28.29 Comparison 929 12.16 33.37 27.88 ?38.75 Expansion 4,262 55.80 ?51.88 31.75 16.38 Overall 7,638 100.00 ?49.11 29.24 21.65 Table 2: Distribution of discourse relations vs. polarities of whole sentences.

Table 6 shows the correlations of sentiment polarities between clauses and the whole sentence.
Total 92.50% of instances be-long to the case (p2 = pw), where the polarity of the second clause is identical to the polarity of the whole sentence.
In Chinese writing, putting the important part of a sentence at the end of the sentence is very common.
4.2 Frequent discourse markers The top discourse markers in our Chinese corpus are shown in Table 7.
For each PDTB class, the five most frequent discourse markers are listed.
In each row of the table, its number of occur-rences and the distribution of its nine sentiment polarity transitions are given.
Note that there are three polarities, i.e., positive, neutral, and nega-tive.
The relatively major sentiment polarity tran-sition of each discourser maker is labeled with the symbol ?.
The symbol ?
is marked when the sentiment polarity is the majority, i.e., its ratio is greater than 50%.
Some discourse markers are the top markers in more than one discourse relation such as ?
(also) and ?
(still).
In the discourse marker dictionary, the word ?
(also) is defined as a discoursemarker of the Expansion relation.
However, this word is frequent in the instances of all the four relations.
In different relations, the distributions of the sentiment transitions of this word differ.
In other words, the word ?
(also), which is a common word in Chinese, is not only used as a discourse marker for emphasizing the Expansion relation, but also has various senses in other us-ages.
For instance, the word ?
in (S3) is a dis-course marker to denote an Expansion relation, but it is a particle in (S4).
In fact, (S4) is an in-stance of the implicit Contingency relation.
We ignore all of instances of the word ?
(also) in the following analysis since it is an outlier.
(S3) ???????????
(This is an af-firmation of our work)??????????????
(and also our encouragement and mo-tivation)?
(S4) ???????
(The mind cannot be open to forward progress)????????
(the world becomes narrow)?
The word ?
(still) is another ambiguous dis-course marker.
Besides the Expansion relation defined in the dictionary, it is sometimes used to denote the Temporal relation, especially in the negation context, e.g., ??
(not yet).
The two frequent discourse markers of the Contingency relation, ??
(due to) and ??
(because) share the similar sense, and their dis-tributions of sentiment polarity transitions are more consistent than the other markers of the Contingency relation.
The most frequent discourse marker of the Comparison class is ?
(but).
The other two dis-course markers ?
(but) and ??
(but) share the similar sense, however, their polarity distribu-tions differ significantly.
Compared to the more general marker ?
(but), the second frequent marker ?
(but) is bolder and more critical.
(S5) is an example of the marker ?
(but).
As shown in our data, the marker ?
(but) is likely to high-light the negative sentences.74PDTB  Class Discourse Markers # Distribution of each type of sentiment polarity transition (%) Neu Neu Pos Neu Neg Neu Neu Pos Pos Pos Neg Pos Neu Neg Pos Neg Neg Neg Temporal ??

Five most frequent discourse makers of each PDTB class in our corpus.

(The new type of crime is so startling)????????????
(but had never been disclosed before solved)?
The other discourser marker ??
(but) is an emphasized version of the marker ?
(but) so that it is more likely used in the stronger polarity transitions such as Positive-Negative and Nega-tive-Positive.
In addition, the sense of the marker ?
(however) is also similar to the sense of ?
(but), but it is more frequent to be used in the neutral situations.
These linguistic phenomena show that the synonyms may have different sen-timent usages in the real world.
4.3 Association between discourse relation and sentiment polarity To analyze the data at a higher level, we reor-ganize the sentiment transitions into several tran-sition categories from four aspects.
The details are shown in Table 8.
The first aspect is Polarity Tendency, which classifies the transitions into three categories, including Positive-Tendency, Neutral, and Negative-Tendency.
This aspect reflects the overall polarity of both arguments.
The Negative-Positive transition is considered as Positive-Tendency because the emphasis of a Chinese sentence is usually placed in the last clause.
Similarly, the Positive-Negative transition is considered as Negative-Tendency.
The second aspect is Polarity Change, which indicates if the polarities of both arguments are opposite.
Only Negative-Positive and Positive-Negative are re-garded as Opposite.
All the rest transitions aretreated as NonOpposite.
The third aspect is Di-rection, which captures the movement from the first clause to the second one.
To-Positive stands for the transitions in which the polarity of the second clause is more positive than that of the first clause.
On the other hand, To-Negative stands for the transitions in which the polarity of the second clause is less positive than that of the first clause.
Equal stands for the cases in which the polarities of both clauses are identical.
The last aspect is Negativity, which regards the polar-ity of an argument as binary values, i.e., Negative and NonNegative.
In this way, we re-classify the nine-way sentiment polarity transitions into four transitions.
In other words, both the polarity states Neutral and Positive are merged into one state NonNegative in this aspect.
Such a binary scheme is also used in some related work, in which the negative polarity is distinguished and the rest are considered Positive (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Devitt and Ahmad, 2007).
For each type of each aspect, five discourse markers that occur more than 10 times in the dataset and have the highest ratio of the corresponding type are listed in the fifth column of Table 8 as significant dis-course markers.
We analyze the annotations according to the four aspects, and the results are shown in Table 9.
The chi-squared test is used to test the dependen-cy between the PDTB classes of discourse mark-ers and each aspect of sentiment transitions.
The results show that no matter whether the senti-ment polarity transitions are categorized into Po-larity Tendency, Polarity Change, Direction, or Negativity, the classes of discourse relations are75significantly dependent on the sentiment polari-ties of the arguments at p=0.001.
In the aspect of Polarity Tendency, the ratios of Neutral in the Temporal and Expansion rela-tions are 57.01% and 48.33%, respectively, which are definitely higher than those of Contin-gency and Comparison relations.
In other words, the two arguments of Contingency and Compari-son relations are less likely to be neutral.
The ratio of Negative-Tendency of the Comparison relation is 46.72%.
It confirms the Comparison relation is likely to be involved in negative statements.
As shown in Table 8, three of the five significant discourse markers of Negative-Tendency are the synonyms of ?
(but), which are discourse markers of  the Comparison rela-tion.
The other two markers, ??
(otherwise) and ?
(because), are discourse markers of the Contingency relation.
Like the word otherwise in English, ??
(otherwise) is used for introducing what bad scenario will happen if something is not done.
The marker ?
(because) is not only a significant discourse marker of the category Negative-Tendency, but also a significant markerof Negative-Negative from the aspect of Negativ-ity.
From the real data, we find this marker is often used in bad cause-and-effect statements.
(S6) is an example.
The usage of the other dis-course marker ??
(because), which is a syno-nyms of ?
(because), is more general.
(S6) ?????????
(Because the tow-el is without sunlight for a long time)??????????
(it is easy to breed bacteria and fungi)?
The ratio of Opposite of Comparison relation from the aspect of Polarity Change is 38.43%.
Although it is not as high as expected, it is the highest among the four PDTB classes and much higher than those of three other classes.
Com-pared to the other classes, Comparison is most likely to have a pair of opposite arguments.
Four of the five significant discourse markers of Opposite in Table 8 are the synonyms of ?
(but).
Expansion relation has the highest ratio of NonOpposite.
This matches our expectation that the Expansion relation is used to concatenate several events which have similar properties   Aspect  Transition Category Sentiment polarity transitions Explanation Significant Discourse Markers Polarity Tendency Positive-Tendency Pos-Neu, Neu-Pos, Pos-Pos, Neg-Pos The two arguments present an overall positive polarity.

from certain perspective.
The ratio of To-Negative of Comparison rela-tion from the aspect of Direction in Table 9 is 42.30%, which is significantly higher than the ratios of To-Negative of the other classes.
This also confirms the Comparison relation is likely to be used to express critical opinions.
Further-more, the ratio of Equal of Comparison relations is much lower than those of other classes.
This result shows the Comparison relation is more involved in sentiment polarity transitions.
The Negativity aspect in Table 9 also shows the NonNegative-Negative is more likely to hap-pen than the Negative-NonNegative in all rela-tions.
This statistics reflects a particular phenom-enon ?good words ahead?
in Chinese.
That is, speakers tend to express a negative opinion after kind words.
The sentiment polarity flips in the instances of the two categories Negative-NonNegative and NonNegative-Negative.
However, the significant discourse markers of the two categories are very different.
In spite of the general marker ??
(but), the discourse markers ?
(but), ??
(oth-erwise), ??...?
(even if...), and ??
(but) are often used in NonNegative-Negative, which usu-ally results a negative remark.
On the other hand, the discourse markers??...?
(although...), ??
(but), ??
(finally), and ?
(but) are often used in Negative-NonNegative, which usually results a positive remark.
For example, the dis-course marker ??
(finally), which is a dis-course marker of the Temporal relation, is usu-ally used when an event successfully accom-plished after twists and turns such as (S7).

(finally successfully fought in the automotive industry)?5 Conclusion To investigate the discourse relation and the sen-timent polarity of Chinese discourse markers, we construct a moderate-sized corpus based on the Chinese part of ClueWeb09.
In this paper, our annotation scheme and the analysis of the anno-tation results are shown.
Total 7,638 instances are annotated by native speakers.
The discourse relation distribution of the annotated data is comparable to the distribution of the well-known English discourse corpus PDTB 2.0.
Through the data analysis, we validate certain human intui-tions in Chinese language.
Near half of instances are in neutral sentiment while the Comparison relation is most likely to be involved in negative sentiment.
Furthermore, the high sentiment de-pendency between the last clause and the whole sentence is validated in the data.
The data shows the significant association be-tween the discourse relation and the sentiment polarity.
The arguments of a Comparison rela-tion or a Contingency relation are more likely to be involved in expressing sentiment.
Moreover, the Comparison relation often occurs in the sen-tences with sentiment polarity transitions, and frequently occurs in the instances with the nega-tive sentiment.
On the other hand, the arguments of the Temporal and the Expansion relations are relatively objective.
The behavior of word choice between synonyms is also observed in the data.
Each synonym of a sense may have its own us-age in expressing sentiment.
This paper points out the ambiguities of the discourse markers in Chinese.
That is, a marker may suggest more than one discourse relation.
Besides, words may have both the functions of discourse connectives and non-discourse ones in their surface forms.
These two issues make the interpretation of Chinese discourse markers more challenging.
Determination of their correct uses and disambiguation of their discourse functions will be investigated in the future.77AcknowledgmentsThis research was partially supported by Excel-lent Research Projects of National Taiwan Uni-versity under contract 102R890858 and 2012 Google Research Award.
