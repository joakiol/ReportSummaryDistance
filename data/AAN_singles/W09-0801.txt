Box 9515NL-2300 RA Leidenw.t.van.peursen@religion.leidenuniv.nlAbstractThis paper describes a model that has been de-veloped in the Turgama Project at Leiden Uni-versity to meet the challenges encountered inthe computational analysis of ancient SyriacBiblical manuscripts.
The small size of thecorpus, the absence of native speakers, and thevariation attested in the multitude of textualwitnesses require a model of encoding?ratherthan tagging?that moves from the formal dis-tributional registration of linguistic elementsto functional deductions.
The model is illumi-nated by an example from verb inflection.
Itshows how a corpus-based analysis can im-prove upon the inflectional paradigms given intraditional grammars and how the various or-thographic representations can be accountedfor by an encoding system that registers boththe paradigmatic forms and their attested reali-zations.1 Working with ancient documents1.1 ChallengesIf we wish to make a linguistic analysis of an-cient texts, in our case the Hebrew Bible and itsSyriac translation, the Peshitta (ca.
2nd centuryCE), we are confronted with a number of chal-lenges:?
There is no native speaker of the lan-guages involved.
We do not know in ad-vance what categories are relevant in thelinguistic analysis, what functions a cer-tain construction has, or what functionaloppositions there exist in the languagesystem.
For this reason we should avoid asmuch as we can any model that presup-poses knowledge about the language.?
We have only written sources.
Hence weare challenged by the complex interactionbetween orthographic conventions andmorphological phenomena.
There are evensome orthographic practices which, it isclaimed, have never been supported by aphonological or morphological realization(see section 4.5).?
We are dealing with multiple uniquedocuments.
In philology, the text of theHebrew Bible or its Syriac translation isan abstract notion, a scholarly construct.The corpus that we enter into our databaseconsists of the concrete witnesses to theabstract text.
Textual variants provide use-ful information about language variationand development (section 4.5).?
We are dealing with a small corpus.
TheHebrew Bible contains about 300.000?400.000 words (depending on whether wecount graphic words or functional words);the vocabulary consists of about 8.000 lex-emes.Moreover, because of the context in which ourresearch takes place, at the boundary of linguis-tics and philology, our aim is the construction ofa database with a correctly encoded text.
Becausewe want to understand the text, rather thanmerely collect knowledge about the languagesystem, we have set high standards of accuracyfor the encoding of the text.1.2 DilemmasThese challenges lead to the following dilemmasfor the computational analysis of ancient texts:?
Data-oriented or theory-driven?
Sinceapproaches that presuppose linguisticknowledge are problematic, we want to be1data-oriented, rather than theory-driven.However, approaches that merely try toextract knowledge from the corpus with aminimum of human input are insufficientbecause of the size of our corpus and be-cause we want knowledge about the text,not just about the language.?
Priority for the corpus or the language?Due to the lack of native speakers, the solebasis for our knowledge about the lan-guage is the corpus, but, at the same time,the corpus can only be accessed throughsome linguistic knowledge and some basicunderstanding of the text.
We cannot startfrom scratch, avoiding any preliminaryunderstanding of the text, its language, itsfeatures, and its meaning.
This under-standing is shaped by our scholarly andcultural tradition.
It is based on transmit-ted knowledge.
But we have to find waysin which the computational analysis doesnot only imitate or repeat traditional inter-pretations.1.3 RequirementsThe challenges and dilemmas mentioned aboverequire a model that is deductive rather than in-ductive; that goes from form (the concrete tex-tual data) to function (the categories that we donot know a priori); that entails registering thedistribution of linguistic elements, rather thanmerely adding functional labels?in other words,that involves encoding rather than tagging; thatregisters both the paradigmatic forms and theirrealizations; that allows grammatical categoriesand formal descriptions to be redefined on thebasis of corpus analysis; and that involves inter-active analytical procedures, which are neededfor the level of accuracy we aim for.In the distributional analysis at word level, forexample, we mark prefixes and suffixes, ratherthan tagging a form as ?imperfect 2ms?
etc.Similarly on clause level we identify patternssuch as ?subject + participle + complement?, asagainst the usual practice of giving functionalclause labels such as ?circumstantial clause?.2 Analytical procedureIn our project the analysis of Hebrew and Syriacinvolves a bottom-up linguistic analysis at thefollowing levels:2.1 Word levelThis level concerns the segmentation of wordsinto morphemes, the functional deductions fromthe morphological analysis, and the assignmentof lexically determined word functions.
It will bedescribed in detail in section 3.2.2 Phrase levelAt this level words are combined into phrases(e.g.
noun + adjective).
This entails the morpho-syntactic analysis and the systematic adaptationsof word classes in certain environments (e.g.
ad-jective ?
noun), and the analysis of phrase-internal relations (e.g.
apposition).2.3 Clause levelThis level concerns the combination of phrasesinto clauses (e.g.
conjunction + VP + determinateNP), and the assignment of syntactic functions(e.g.
subject, predicate).2.4 Text levelThis level concerns the determination of the rela-tionships between clauses and the assignment ofthe syntactical functions of the clauses within thetext hierarchy (e.g.
object clause).3 Workflow of word-level analysisIn the following discussion we will restrict our-selves to the morphological analysis.
At thehigher linguistic levels the same principles areapplied, although the consequences are some-what different (see section 5).3.1 Running textAs an example we take the Syriac translation(Peshitta) of the book of Judges.
The starting-point of the analysis is a transliterated runningtext, called P_Judges, which reflects the LeidenPeshitta edition.
Sample 1 contains the first verseof this text.
The variant notation between squarebrackets indicates that the first word, whw', ?andit happened?, is missing in a number of manu-scripts.
Between the angle brackets a commenthas been added.Even this first step involves a number of dis-ambiguating decisions, for example, as towhether a dot above a letter is a vowel sign, adelimitation marker, or just a spot in the manu-script.11 One has to take similar decisions if one transcribesthe text of a manuscript to Unicode, because the defi-nitions of the Unicode characters include both a for-21 [whw'/ -6h7, 8a1c, 10c1, 11c1, 12a1fam]<check reading in 6h7> mn btr dmyt y$w` brnwn`bdh dmry'; 1 $'lw bn:y 'ysryl bmry' w'mr:yn;mnw nsq ln `l kn`n:y' bry$'; lmtkt$w `mhwnbqrb';Sample 1: P_Judges (running text)3.2 Production of graphic text (?pil2wit?
)The program pil2wit transforms the running textinto the so-called graphic text, a transliteratedtext according to an established format that en-ables the subsequent steps in the analysis (sam-ple 2).
It has another transliteration system;2 in-structions to select variants have been executed;comments have been omitted; and the markers ofbook, chapter and verse have been added.1  %bookname Jd2  %language syriac34  %verse 1,15    WHW> MN BTR DMJT JCW< BRNWN <BDH DMRJ>C>LW BN"J >JSRJL BMRJ> W>MR"JN MNW NSQ LN <LKN<N"J> BRJC> LMTKTCW <MHWN BQRB>Sample 2: P_Judices (graphic text)3.3 Production of encoded text (?Analyse?
)The grapic text is the input file for the programAnalyse, which concerns the segmentation of theSyriac words into morphemes (as far as concate-native morphemes are involved3).
For this seg-mentation we use a system of encoding, ratherthan tagging.
Thus the imperfect form neqtol ?hewill kill?
is encoded as !N!QV&WL[, in whichthe exclamation marks !?!
indicate the prefix,the ampersand & a paradigmatically unexpectedletter?the round bracket ( indicates an expectedbut absent letter?and the square bracket to theright [ a verbal ending.

We use :p for the vowelpattern of the passive; :d for the doubled verbal stemand :c for the construct state vocalization of nouns.Sample 3: P_Judices.an (analysed text; automaticallygenerated file)The first column contains the verse number, thesecond the graphic words (which may containmore than one functional word; thus the firstgraphic word contains the conjunction W and theverb HW>) and the third column contains propos-als for the morphological segmentation.
Theseproposals are generated from the ?AnalyticalLexicon?, a data file containing the results of pre-vious analyses (sample 4).9308  WCKR>     W-CKR/~>9309  WCLWM     W-CLWM/9310  WCLX      W-CLX[9311  WCLX      W-CLX[(W9312  WCLXW     W-CLX[W9313  WCLXT     W-CLX[T==Sample 4: Excerpt from the Analytical LexiconIt appears, for example, that up to the momentthat sample 4 was extracted from the lexicon, theform WCLX had received two different encodings(lines 9310 and 9311; see below, section 4.3).The human researcher has to accept or rejectthe proposals made by Analyse or to add a newanalysis.
We cannot go through all details, but inthe second line of sample 4, for example, achoice has to be made between the prepositionmen (MN) and the interrogative pronoun man(MN=; the disambiguating function of the equalssign is recorded in the lexicon [section 3.6],where both MN and MN= are defined).
Likewise,in the case of <BDH, the human researcher has todecide whether this is a verb (hence the verbalending [), the noun ?servant?
(<BD=), or thenoun ?work?
(<BD==).For these disambiguating decisions in the in-teractive procedure the human researcher followsa protocol that describes the relative weight ofdiacritical dots in the oldest manuscripts, thevowel signs that are added in some manuscripts,the vocalization in printed editions, and gram-matical and contextual considerations.1,1 WHW>          W-HW(J&>[1,1 MN            MN1,1 BTR           BTR1,1 DMJT          D-M(W&JT[1,1 JCW<          JCW</1,1 BRNWN         BR/-NWN=/1,1 <BDH          <BD=/-H1,1 DMRJ>         D-MRJ>/Sample 5: P_Judices.an (analysed text; outcome ofinteractive procedure)After the interactive procedure the analysed textcontains the ?correct?

As we shall see be-low, we do not consider this as the definitiveanalysis, but rather as a hypothesis about the datathat can be tested in the following steps of theanalytical procedure.3.4 Reformatting and selection (?Genat?
)The next step concerns the selection of a chapterand the reformatting of the document.
This isdone automatically by the program Genat.

)The next step concerns the functional deductionsfrom the morphological analysis (e.g.
person,number, gender) and the assignment of lexicallydetermined word functions (e.g.
part of speech).For this purpose the program at2ps uses threelanguage definition files: a description of the al-phabet, a lexicon (section 3.6), and a descriptionof the morphology (?Word Grammar?
; section3.7).3.6 The LexiconEach line in the Lexicon contains the lexeme, aunique identification number, lexically relevantcharacteristics such as a part of speech (sp) or alexical set (ls), a gloss (gl), which is only in-tended for the human user and, optionally, acomment added after the hash (#).CLWM 6577:sp=subs:ls=prop:st=abs:gn=m:gl=ShallumCLX 10753:sp=verb:gl=to send, PA to strip,to despoilCLX= 15359:sp=subs:ls=prop:st=abs:gn=m:gl=ShilhiCLX== 32679:sp=subs:de=CLX>:gl=swarm (bees),skin (lamb)      # Judges 14,08Sample 7: Extract from the Lexicon3.7 The ?Word Grammar?The encoded text is read by the Word Grammar.In this auxiliary file are registered (1) the typesof morphemes recognized; (2) the individualmorphemes of each morpheme type; (3) a list ofgrammatical functions; and (4) rules for the func-tional deductions (see samples 8?11).prefix =pfm:  {"!","!"}

The condition isphrased as a Boolean expression yielding true orfalse indicating whether the condition is met ornot.
If the condition is met, the listed actions areundertaken.
An action is usually the assignmentof a value to a word function, but can also in-volve accepting or rejecting a form, or jumpingto a rule further down.
Thus the rule4vbe == "W"   :: gn=m, nu=plcan be read as: if there is a verbal ending W, thenassign the values gender = masculine and num-ber = plural.3.8 Result: the ps2 fileThe result is a ps2 file.
Each row contains a versereference, the lexeme, and a list of lexical andmorphological features such as the lexical set,part of speech, verbal prefix, verbal stem, verbalending, nominal ending, verbal tense, person,number, gender, nominal state.
Thus the secondline of sample 12 shows that the second word ofJudges is HWJ, ?to be?, which has the lexical set?verb of existence?
(-2); it has the part of speech?verb?
(1); it has no verbal prefix (0); it comesfrom the simple verbal stem Peal or Qal (0); ithas an empty verbal ending (1); it has no nomi-nal ending (0); it is a perfect form (2) 3rd person(3) singular (1), without personal suffix (-1),4masculine (2); and the notion of ?state?
does notapply to it (-1), because this notion is only usedin the case of nominal endings.01,01 W    0   6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1   -1 -1 -1 -1    -101,01 HWJ -2   1  0  0  1  0 -1    2  3  1  2    -101,01 MN   0   5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1   -1 -1 -1 -1    -101,01 BTR  0   5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1   -1 -1 -1 -1    -101,01 D   -1   5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1   -1 -1 -1 -1    -101,01 MWT  0   1  0  0  1  0 -1    2  3  1  2    -101,01 JCW< 0   3 -1 -1 -1  1 -1   -1 -1  0  2     201,01 BR   0   2 -1 -1 -1  1 -1   -1 -1  0  2     001,01 NWN= 0   3 -1 -1 -1  1 -1   -1 -1  0  2     2Sample 12: P_Judices.ps2From this file two files are automatically gener-ated: an encoded surface text (xxx.ct) and a datadescription in human readable form (xxx.dmp).1  RICHT01,01 W-HW> MN BTR D-MJT JCW< BR-NWN<BD-H D-MRJ> C>LW BNJ >JSRJL B-MRJ> W->MRJNMN-W NSQ L-N <L KN<NJ> B-RJC> L-MTKTCW <M-HWNB-QRB> *Sample 13: P_Judices01.ct1,1 W       W    W sp=conj1,1 HW(J&>[ HW>  HWJ vbe="",sp=verb,vo=act,vs=pe,vt=pf,ps=third,nu=sg,gn=m,ls=vbex1,1 MN      MN   MN sp=prep1,1 BTR     BTR  BTR sp=prep4 This column comes from an earlier phase of ourproject.
In our present encoding the value is always?inapplicable?

Its lexeme statusappears from its own grammatical functions, whichare different from those of the word to which it is at-tached.
The traditional lexicographical practice, how-ever, does not treat it as a lexeme (Sikkel, 2008).1,1 D       D    D ls=pcon,sp=prep1,1 M(W&JT[ MJT  MWT vbe="" sp=verb,vo=act,vs=pe,vt=pf,ps=third,nu=sg,gn=m1,1 JCW</   JCW< JCW< nme="" sp=subs,+nu,gn=m,st=abs,ls=prop1,1 BR/     BR   BR nme="" sp=subs,+nu,gn=m,+st1,1 NWN=/   NWN  NWN= nme="" sp=subs,+nu,gn=m,st=abs,ls=propSample 14: P_Judices01.dmp3.9 Summary of the workflowThe workflow can be summarized as follows:Input & output Programs Auxiliaryfiles  filesTable 1: workflow of word level analysisIt follows that the following programs and datasets are used:?
Programs that recognize the patterns offormal elements that combine to formwords, phrases, clauses and textual units(e.g.
at2ps).?
Language-specific auxiliary files (e.g.Lexicon, Word Grammar).?
Data sets, built up gradually, containingall patterns registered in the analysis (e.g.Analytical Lexicon)?

Theprocedure of encoding rather than tagging guar-antees consistency in the analysis of morphemes,because the functional deductions are producedautomatically.
It has the advantage that not onlythe interpretation of a word, but also the datawhich led to a certain interpretation can be re-trieved, whereas the motivation behind a taggingis usually not visible.
It also has the advantagethat both the surface forms and the functionalanalysis are preserved.By using the language-specific auxiliary fileswe take our starting-point in the scholarly tradi-tion of Semitic studies, but the encoding systemallows us to test alternative interpretations of thedata (see below, section 4.5).4 The verbal paradigm4.1 Traditional grammarsWe will now illuminate our model by taking alook at the verbal paradigm.
For the moment wewill restrict ourselves to the paradigm of the suf-fix conjugation.
In the traditional grammars wefind the following inflection paradigm:singular plural3 m ?
w [silent]?wn (un)3 f t (at) ?y [silent]2 m t (t) twn (ton)2 f ty (t) tyn (ten)1 c t (et) n (n)nn (nan)Table 2: Paradigm of the perfect in Classical Syriacaccording to traditional grammars4.2 Manuscript evidenceSince we work with real manuscripts, we have todeal with the forms that are actually attested.
Asappears from the paradigm in table 2, for exam-ple, the perfect 3mp sometimes has no verbalending.
What is not recorded in the traditionalgrammars is that there are also forms 3ms withthe ending -w. This may be due to the fact thatthe -w in the plural, even if it were represented inwriting, was not pronounced.5 Traditionally the5 Admittedly, it can be problematic to make claimsabout the pronunciation on the basis of writtensources, but there are strong arguments for this claim,singular forms with -w are taken as errors, due tothe confusion with the silent -w in the plural.The Leiden Peshitta edition takes such read-ings as ?orthographic variants?.
They do not ap-pear in the critical apparatus to the text, but in aseparate Index Orthographicus.
The general pref-ace to the edition contains a long list of catego-ries of orthographical variation (cf.
sample 15).2.2 varietates inflectionis2.2.1 afformativa2.2.1.1 perfectume.g.

IV/6, containing Odes, thePrayer of Manasseh, Apocryphal Psalms, Psalmsof Solomon, Tobit and 1(3) Esdras).including the fact that the final letter is ignored inpunctuation, that it is frequently omitted in writing(N?ldeke, 2001:?50), and that it does not affect poeticpatterns (Brockelmann, 1960:45).64.3 Encoding the attested formsIn the word-level analysis (cf.
section 2.1) theforms listed in table 2 are encoded as follows:singular plural3m KTB[ KTB[WKTB[(WKTB[W&N3f KTB[T== KTB[(J=KTB[J=2m KTB[T= KTB[TWN2f KTB[TJ KTB[TJN1c KTB[T KTB[NKTB[N&NTable 3: Encoded forms of Classical Syriac perfectAs we said above, the square bracket to the rightmarks the verbal ending and the ampersand aparadigmatically unexpected letter.
Thus our en-coding in table 3 implies that we take the verbalending -wn as an allomorph of -w with an addi-tional -n. Alternatively we could decide to intro-duce a separate morpheme -wn besides -w. Theequals sign is used for the disambiguation offorms that have the same consonantal representa-tion.
We use it to distinguish the three verbalendings -t and for distinguishing the -y of theperfect 3fs from the -y of the imperative 3fs.A round bracket marks a paradigmatically ex-pected but absent letter.
Thus we have taken theimperfect form 3fs KTBJ as the paradigmaticform, although KTB occurs as well.4.4 Paradigmatic forms and their realiza-tionsTo deal with this material in an appropriate wayit is important to use an encoding system inwhich both the attested surface forms and theabstract morphemes can be retrieved.
Thus?wqdw ?they burnt (it)?
(Judges 1:8; our tran-scription: >WQDW) is a form of the verb yqd(JQD), with the causative prefix ?- (>).
We markthe causative stem morpheme with two squarebrackets to the left (cf.
sample 8), indicate withthe round bracket to the right that the first letterof the lexeme is absent, and mark with the am-persand the w that has come instead.
The squarebracket to the right marks the verbal ending.
Thisresults in the following encoding:Encoding:           ]>](J&WQD[WParadigmatic forms:  >  JQD   WRealizations:        >  WQD   W4.5 Language variation and language de-velopmentThis way of encoding the verb forms attested inmultiple textual witnesses provides us with alarge database from which language variationdata can be retrieved.
In some cases languagedevelopment is involved as well, and the datacan be used for diachronic analysis.
For this re-search we can build upon the work done by theSyriac scholar Sebastian Brock.
One of the phe-nomena Brock (2003:99?100) observed was thatin West Syriac Biblical manuscripts some ortho-graphic innovations are attested, including theaddition of a -y to the perfect 3fp, the imperfect3fs and, on analogy, the perfect 3fs.
It is a de-bated issue whether this ending reflects a mor-pheme that was once pronounced (thus Boyarin,1981) or just an orthographic convention (thusBrock, 2003; cf.
Van Peursen, 2008:244).4.6 An experimentOur approach enables us to deploy a practice thatis completely new in Syriac scholarship, namelythe possibility of testing assumptions upon thedata (cf.
Talstra & Dyk, 2006).
We can test, forexample, what happens if we redefine the distri-bution of ktb and ktbw (cf.
section 4.2) and takethe zero ending and the -w as allomorphs for the3rd person masculine.In our model such a reinterpretation of the ma-terial can be registered formally by changing therelevant sections in the Word Grammar.
Sincethe lemmatization is done automatically on thebasis of the morphologically encoded text and afunctional description of the morphemes, there isno need to change the lemmatization in all sepa-rate instances manually.We have done this experiment for Judges 1 innineteen manuscripts.
This chapter contains 54perfect forms 3m (except for third-weak verbs).In the bottom-up analysis (cf.
section 2) the ef-fect is that the decision on whether a 3m verb issingular or plural is not taken at word level, butat a later stage of the procedure, in which theverb is matched with a subject or another ele-ment that reveals its number.At first sight the results of our experimentwere not exciting.
In those 26 cases where thegrammatical number of the subject is unambigu-ous, the ?regular?
forms are dominant: Only threetimes is there an irregular form (singular ktbw orplural ktb), once in one manuscript, twice in two7manuscripts.6 Nevertheless, our experimentyielded some interesting observations.In the first place we discovered that in 28cases the grammatical number remained am-biguous even in the clause-level analysis becausethe subject was a collective noun (which inSyriac can take either a singular or a plural).In these ambiguous cases the traditional analy-sis of ktb as a singular and ktbw as a plural im-plies a striking alternation of singular and pluralforms, e.g.
1:10 ?and Judah went (w?zl, singular)?
and [they] killed (wq?lw, plural)?.
In our ex-periment, this became mere orthographic varia-tion.
Consequently, in the final stage of the bot-tom-up analytical procedure, the text hierarchicalanalysis (section 2.4), we arrived at a more ele-gant text hierarchical structure, because many ofthe recurrent subject changes caused by the sin-gular/plural alternation had been resolved.Secondly, the experiment overcame the ratherarbitrary division between ?real?
and ortho-graphic variants in the Leiden Peshitta edition.
Inthis edition, whenever there may be some doubtas to whether the verb is in the singular or in theplural, variation between ktb and ktbw forms istaken as ?real?
and the variant is included in thecritical apparatus; whenever there is no doubt,the variation is considered orthographic and thevariant is listed in the Index Orthographicus(sample edition and vol.
IV/6) or not mentionedat all (other volumes; cf.
Dirksen, 1972:vii-ix).This editorial policy leads to the somewhat ar-bitrary decision that n?t ?descended?
in 1:9 (Ms16c1, 16g3; other manuscripts: n?
?w) is an or-thographic variant, because the subject is the plu-ral bny yhwd?
?sons of Judah, Judahites?, whereasin 1:10, where the subject is just yhwd?
?Judah?,?zlw ?went?
(Ms 17a3; other manuscripts: ?zl) is areal variant.
In 1:26, the same form ?zlw (Ms19c1; other manuscripts have again ?zl) is takenas orthographic, because the subject is the singu-lar noun gbr?
?
(the) man?.
In our experiment allthese variant readings are treated equally.5 ConclusionsWe hope to have shown how the analytical pro-cedure (section 2) and the workflow of the word-level analysis (section 3) meet the challenges ofworking with ancient documents (section 1), dueto their form-to-function approach, their use ofencoding rather than tagging, their distinction6 26 forms ?
19 manuscripts = 494 forms in all themanuscripts together.
Accordingly, the 5 (1+2?2)irregular forms make up 1%.between paradigmatic forms and their realiza-tions, and because of the exigencies of accuracyin the case of an ancient limited corpus.In the word-level analysis we lean heavily onexisting grammars.
For that reason our approachcould be regarded as theory-driven, even thoughwe consider it one of our main tasks to revise andrefine the paradigm on the basis of the actualcorpora.
Our encodings should be considered ashypotheses about the data that can be subjectedto testing and experiment (section 4.6).Unlike projects that concern the accelerationof POS tagging (Ringger et al, 2007; Caroll etal., 2007) we start one level below, with themorphology.
?Encoding rather than tagging?
isnot just a practical, but a crucial methodologicalcharacteristic of our model.
(For new insightsthat it produced regarding Syriac morphology seethe publications by Bakker, Van Keulen and VanPeursen in the bibliography).
We differ from thecomputer implementation of morphological rules(Kiraz, 2001) in that our work is more deductiveand focused on the interaction between orthogra-phy and morphology, because we start with theactual forms attested in the manuscripts.
Our po-sition in relation to these other projects is mainlydetermined by the philological demands that di-rect our research (see section 1).Whereas at the morphological level the infor-mation provided by traditional grammars is rela-tively stable, at the higher linguistic levels theyprovide much less solid ground.
The graduallybuilt up datasets (analogous to the AnalyticalLexicon at word level) of phrase patterns, clausepatterns, or verbal valence contain much infor-mation that is not properly dealt with in tradi-tional grammars.
At these levels the analysis be-comes more data-oriented.
Thus in the analysisof phrase structure Van Peursen (2007) foundmany complex patterns that have not been dealtwith in traditional grammars.We have taken our examples from Syriac, butthe same analytical procedures have been appliedto other forms of Aramaic (Biblical Aramaic andTargum Aramaic) and Biblical Hebrew.
Becauseof the separation of the analytical programs andthe language-specific auxiliary files, it should bepossible to apply it to other languages as well.This would mainly require writing the appropri-ate language definition files.
Although our modelis in principle language-independent, the mor-phological analysis presented in this paper is es-pecially apt for Semitic languages because oftheir rich morphology.8AcknowledgmentsThis paper has benefited much from the valuableinput of other members of the project ?Turgama:Computer-Assisted Analysis of the Peshitta andthe Targum: Text, Language and Interpretation?of the Leiden Institute for Religious Studies;from the documentation of the Werkgroep Infor-matica of the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam; andfrom the collations of variant readings in thePeshitta manuscripts to Judges by Dr P.B.
