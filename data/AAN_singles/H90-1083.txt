A Microphone-Array System forSpeech Recognition InputHarvey F. SilvermanLaboratory for Engineering Man/Machine Systems (LEMS)Brown UniversityObjectiveThis project is concexned with underlying mathematical algorithms, acoustics, hardware, and software to gain anunderstanding about, demonstrate tbe principles of, and, ultimately, to build an appropriate microphone-array system forspeech-recognition input.ApproachThe approach taken might be called "recursive build-and-study".
After investigating the layout problem and potentialDSP architectures, we developed our first system.
This allowed us to investigate real data and learn the real issues, begin tounderstand the difficult acoustics problems, and develop better DSP designs.
This process is being repeated.Recent AccomplishmentsA new, nonlinear optimization algorithm called Stochastic Region Contraction (SRC), has been developed and has beenapplied to the microphone placement problem, talker location, and talker characterization.
We have found that SRC isnearly two orders of magnitude faster than was simulated annealing.
Our current research array system has been "har-dened", and recal-time, time-domain beamforming is operational.Plans for the coming year?
Pefect one or more talker location algorithms and implement into real-time system?
Develop adjunct algorithm to work with locator to track a talker?
Demonstrate preliminary algorithms for talker characterization?
Complete a second research platform which can perform both tracking and beam forming in real time?
Develop accurate test methodology for understanding the acoustic properties of the sensor/room environment.410
