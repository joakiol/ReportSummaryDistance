Allsuch systems call for high-performancetransliteration, which is the focus ofshared task in the NEWS 2010 workshop.The objective of the shared task is to pro-mote machine transliteration research byproviding a common benchmarking plat-form for the community to evaluate thestate-of-the-art technologies.1 Task DescriptionThe task is to develop machine transliteration sys-tem in one or more of the specified language pairsbeing considered for the task.
Each language pairconsists of a source and a target language.
Thetraining and development data sets released foreach language pair are to be used for developinga transliteration system in whatever way that theparticipants find appropriate.
At the evaluationtime, a test set of source names only would bereleased, on which the participants are expectedto produce a ranked list of transliteration candi-dates in another language (i.e.
n-best translitera-tions), and this will be evaluated using commonmetrics.
For every language pair the participantsmust submit at least one run that uses only thedata provided by the NEWS workshop organisersin a given language pair (designated as ?standard?run, primary submission).
Users may submit more?stanrard?
runs.
They may also submit several?non-standard?
runs for each language pair that?http://translit.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/news2010/use other data than those provided by the NEWS2010 workshop; such runs would be evaluated andreported separately.2 Important DatesResearch paper submission deadline 1 May 2010Shared taskRegistration opens 1 Feb 2010Registration closes 13 Mar 2010Training/Development data release 19 Feb 2010Test data release 13 Mar 2010Results Submission Due 20 Mar 2010Results Announcement 27 Mar 2010Task (short) Papers Due 5 Apr 2010For all submissionsAcceptance Notification 6 May 2010Workshop Date 16 Jul 20103 Participation1.
Registration (1 Feb 2010)(a) NEWS Shared Task opens for registra-tion.
(b) Prospective participants are to register tothe NEWS Workshop homepage.2.
Training & Development Data (19 Feb 2010)(a) Registered participants are to obtaintraining and development data from theShared Task organiser and/or the desig-nated copyright owners of databases.
(b) All registered participants are requiredto participate in the evaluation of at leastone language pair, submit the results anda short paper and attend the workshop atACL 2010.3.
Evaluation Script (19 Feb 2010)12(a) A sample test set and expected user out-put format are to be released.
(b) An evaluation script, which runs on theabove two, is to be released.
(c) The participants must make sure thattheir output is produced in a way thatthe evaluation script may run and pro-duce the expected output.
(d) The same script (with held out test dataand the user outputs) would be used forfinal evaluation.4.
Test data (13 Mar 2010)(a) The test data would be released on 13March 2010, and the participants have amaximum of 7 days to submit their re-sults in the expected format.
(b) One ?standard?
run must be submit-ted from every group on a given lan-guage pair.
Additional ?standard?
runsmay be submitted, up to 4 ?standard?runs in total.
However, the partici-pants must indicate one of the submit-ted ?standard?
runs as the ?primary sub-mission?.
The primary submission willbe used for the performance summary.In addition to the ?standard?
runs, more?non-standard?
runs may be submitted.In total, maximum 8 runs (up to 4 ?stan-dard?
runs plus up to 4 ?non-standard?runs) can be submitted from each groupon a registered language pair.
The defi-nition of ?standard?
and ?non-standard?runs is in Section 5.
(c) Any runs that are ?non-standard?
mustbe tagged as such.
(d) The test set is a list of names in sourcelanguage only.
Every group will pro-duce and submit a ranked list of translit-eration candidates in another languagefor each given name in the test set.Please note that this shared task is a?transliteration generation?
task, i.e.,given a name in a source language oneis supposed to generate one or moretransliterations in a target language.
Itis not the task of ?transliteration discov-ery?, i.e., given a name in the source lan-guage and a set of names in the targetlanguage evaluate how to find the ap-propriate names from the target set thatare transliterations of the given sourcename.5.
Results (27 Mar 2010)(a) On 27 March 2010, the evaluation re-sults would be announced and will bemade available on the Workshop web-site.
(b) Note that only the scores (in respectivemetrics) of the participating systems oneach language pairs would be published,and no explicit ranking of the participat-ing systems would be published.
(c) Note that this is a shared evaluation taskand not a competition; the results aremeant to be used to evaluate systems oncommon data set with common metrics,and not to rank the participating sys-tems.
While the participants can cite theperformance of their systems (scores onmetrics) from the workshop report, theyshould not use any ranking informationin their publications.
(d) Furthermore, all participants shouldagree not to reveal identities of otherparticipants in any of their publicationsunless you get permission from the otherrespective participants.
By default, allparticipants remain anonymous in pub-lished results, unless they indicate oth-erwise at the time of uploading their re-sults.
Note that the results of all systemswill be published, but the identities ofthose participants that choose not to dis-close their identity to other participantswill be masked.
As a result, in this case,your organisation name will still appearin the web site as one of participants, butit will not be linked explicitly to your re-sults.6.
Short Papers on Task (5 Apr 2010)(a) Each submitting site is required to sub-mit a 4-page system paper (short paper)for its submissions, including their ap-proach, data used and the results on ei-ther test set or development set or by n-fold cross validation on training set.
(b) The review of the system papers will bedone to improve paper quality and read-ability and make sure the authors?
ideas13and methods can be understood by theworkshop participants.
We are aimingat accepting all system papers, and se-lected ones will be presented orally inthe NEWS 2010 workshop.
(c) All registered participants are requiredto register and attend the workshop tointroduce your work.
(d) All paper submission and review will bemanaged electronically through https://www.softconf.com/acl2010/NEWS.4 Language PairsThe tasks are to transliterate personal names orplace names from a source to a target language assummarised in Table 1.
NEWS 2010 Shared Taskoffers 12 evaluation subtasks, among them ChEnand ThEn are the back-transliteration of EnCh andEnTh tasks respectively.
NEWS 2010 releasestraining, development and testing data for each ofthe language pairs.
NEWS 2010 continues somelanguage pairs that were evaluated in NEWS 2009.In such cases, the training and development data inthe release of NEWS 2010 may overlap with thosein NEWS 2009.
However, the test data in NEWS2010 are entirely new.The names given in the training sets for Chi-nese, Japanese, Korean and Thai languages areWestern names and their respective translitera-tions; the Japanese Name (in English)?
JapaneseKanji data set consists only of native Japanesenames; the Arabic data set consists only of nativeArabic names.
The Indic data set (Hindi, Tamil,Kannada, Bangla) consists of a mix of Indian andWestern names.Examples of transliteration:English?

If they are cleaned up manually, weappeal that such data be providedback to the organisers for redistri-bution to all the participating groupsin that language pair; such sharingbenefits all participants, and furtherensures that the evaluation providesnormalisation with respect to dataquality.ii.
If automatic cleanup were used,such cleanup would be considered apart of the system fielded, and hencenot required to be shared with allparticipants.4.
Standard Runs We expect that the partici-pants to use only the data (parallel names)provided by the Shared Task for translitera-tion task for a ?standard?
run to ensure a fairevaluation.
One such run (using only the dataprovided by the shared task) is mandatory forall participants for a given language pair thatthey participate in.5.
Non-standard Runs If more data (either par-allel names data or monolingual data) wereused, then all such runs using extra data mustbe marked as ?non-standard?.
For such ?non-standard?
runs, it is required to disclose thesize and characteristics of the data used in thesystem paper.6.
A participant may submit a maximum of 8runs for a given language pair (including themandatory 1 ?standard?
run marked as ?pri-mary submission?
).6 Paper FormatPaper submissions to NEWS 2010 should followthe ACL 2010 paper submission policy, includ-ing paper format, blind review policy and title andauthor format convention.
Full papers (researchpaper) are in two-column format without exceed-ing eight (8) pages of content plus one extra pagefor references and short papers (task paper) arealso in two-column format without exceeding four(4) pages, including references.
Submission mustconform to the official ACL 2010 style guidelines.For details, please refer to the ACL 2010 website2.7 Evaluation MetricsWe plan to measure the quality of the translitera-tion task using the following 4 metrics.
We acceptup to 10 output candidates in a ranked list for eachinput entry.Since a given source name may have multiplecorrect target transliterations, all these alternativesare treated equally in the evaluation.
That is, anyof these alternatives are considered as a correcttransliteration, and the first correct transliterationin the ranked list is accepted as a correct hit.The following notation is further assumed:2http://acl2010.org/authors.html15N : Total number of names (sourcewords) in the test setni : Number of reference transliterationsfor i-th name in the test set (ni ?
1)ri,j : j-th reference transliteration for i-thname in the test setci,k : k-th candidate transliteration (systemoutput) for i-th name in the test set(1 ?
k ?
10)Ki : Number of candidate transliterationsproduced by a transliteration system1.
Word Accuracy in Top-1 (ACC) Alsoknown as Word Error Rate, it measures correct-ness of the first transliteration candidate in the can-didate list produced by a transliteration system.ACC = 1 means that all top candidates are cor-rect transliterations i.e.
they match one of the ref-erences, and ACC = 0 means that none of the topcandidates are correct.ACC =1NN?i=1{1 if ?
ri,j : ri,j = ci,1;0 otherwise}(1)2.
Fuzziness in Top-1 (Mean F-score) Themean F-score measures how different, on average,the top transliteration candidate is from its closestreference.
F-score for each source word is a func-tion of Precision and Recall and equals 1 when thetop candidate matches one of the references, and0 when there are no common characters betweenthe candidate and any of the references.Precision and Recall are calculated based on thelength of the Longest Common Subsequence be-tween a candidate and a reference:LCS(c, r) =12(|c|+ |r| ?
ED(c, r)) (2)where ED is the edit distance and |x| is the lengthof x.
For example, the longest common subse-quence between ?abcd?
and ?afcde?
is ?acd?
andits length is 3.
The best matching reference, thatis, the reference for which the edit distance hasthe minimum, is taken for calculation.
If the bestmatching reference is given byri,m = argminj(ED(ci,1, ri,j)) (3)then Recall, Precision and F-score for i-th wordare calculated asRi =LCS(ci,1, ri,m)|ri,m|(4)Pi =LCS(ci,1, ri,m)|ci,1|(5)Fi = 2Ri ?
PiRi + Pi(6)?
The length is computed in distinct Unicodecharacters.?
No distinction is made on different charactertypes of a language (e.g., vowel vs. conso-nants vs. combining diereses?
etc.)3.
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) Measurestraditional MRR for any right answer produced bythe system, from among the candidates.
1/MRRtells approximately the average rank of the correcttransliteration.
MRR closer to 1 implies that thecorrect answer is mostly produced close to the topof the n-best lists.RRi ={minj 1j if ?ri,j , ci,k : ri,j = ci,k;0 otherwise}(7)MRR =1NN?i=1RRi (8)4.
MAPref Measures tightly the precision in then-best candidates for i-th source name, for whichreference transliterations are available.
If all ofthe references are produced, then the MAP is 1.Let?s denote the number of correct candidates forthe i-th source word in k-best list as num(i, k).MAPref is then given byMAPref =1NN?i1ni(ni?k=1num(i, k))(9)8 Contact UsIf you have any questions about this share task andthe database, please email toDr.
