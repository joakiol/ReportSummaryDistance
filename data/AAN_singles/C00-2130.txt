ac.ukAbstractwe present an implelnented system for processingdefinite descriptions.
The system is based on the re-sults of a corpus analysis previously reported, whichshowed how common discourse-new descriptionsare in newspaper corpora, and identified severalproblems to be dealt with when developing compu-tational methods for interpreting bridging descrip-tions.
The annotated corpus produced in this ear-licr work was used to extensively evaluate the pro-posed techniques for matchiug delinite descriptionswith their antecedents, discourse segmentation, rec-ognizing discourse-new descriptions, and suggest-ing anchors for bridging descriptions.1 MotivationIn previous work (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) we re-ported the results of corpus annotation experimentsin which the subjects were asked to classify lhe usesof delinite descriptions in Wall Stree Journal arti-cles according to a scheme derived from work byHawkins (1978) and Prince (1981 ) and includingthree classes: I)II{I'~CT ANAPltORA, I)ISCOURSE-NEW, and I~RIDGING DESCI{II'TION (Clark, 1977).This study showed that about half of the time, deli-nite descriptions are used to introduce a new entityin the discourse, rather than to refer to an object al-ready mentioned.
We also observed that our sub-jects didn't always agree on the classification of agiven delinite; the problem was especially acute forbridging descriptions.In this paper, we present an implemented systemfor processing delinite descriptions based on the re-suits of that earlier study.
In our system, techniquesfor recognising discourse-new descriptions play arole as ilnportant as techniques for identifying theantecedent of anaphoric ones.
The system also in-corporates robust techniques for processing bridg-ing descriptions.A fundamental characteristic ofour system is thatit was developed so that its perfomlance could beevaluated using the annotated corpus.
In the papm;we discuss how we arrived at the optimal version ofthe system by measuring the performance of eachmethod in this way.
Because of the problems ob-served in our previous tudy concerning agreementbetween annotators, we evaluated the system bothby measnring precision/recall against a 'gold stan-dard' and by meastu'ing the agreement between theannotation it produces and the mmotators.2 General OverviewAt the moment, the only systems engaged in se-mantic interpretation whose performance can beevaluated on l'aMy unrestricted text such as theWall Street Journal articles are based on a shallow-processing approach, i.e., that do not rely on exten-sive amounts of hand-coded commonsense knowl-edge (Carter, 1987; Appelt, 1995; Humphreys et al,1998).
I Our system is of this type: it only relieson structural information, on the infommtion pro-vided by pre-existing lexical sources uch as Word-Net (Fellbaum, 1998), on minimal amouuts of gen-eral hand-coded iuformation, and on informationthat can be acquired automatically from a corpus.Although we believe that quantitative ewduations ofthe performance of a systeln on a large number ofexamples are the only true assessment of its perfor-mance, and therefore a shallow processing approachis virtually unavoidable for implemented systemsuntil better sources of commonsense knowledge be-come available, we do know that this approach liln-its the performance of a system on those instancesof definite descriptions which do require common-sense knowledge for their resolution.
(We groupedthese in what we call the 'bridging' chtss.)

The second includes del Linile descriptions that refer to objects not alma@mentioned in the text and ,lot rclated to any suchobject.
(Some of these definite descriptions referto objects whose existence is widely known, suchas discourse-initial references to lhe i)ot;e; other in-stances of discourse-new descriptions refer to o1:>jects thai can be assumed to bc unique, even if unfa~miliar, such as lhe.filwl woman lo climb all ScollishMum'os.)
lqnally, we classify as bridging descrip-tions all dclinitc descriptions whose resolution de-.pen(Is on knowledge of relalions between objects,such as delinite descriptions thai refer to an objectrehlted 1o an entity ah'eady introduced in the dis--com'se by a relation other than identity (Prince's'inlerrables'), as in the f la t .

lhe  vehicle, hi addition to this chlssitica-lion, the system iries to identify the antecedentsof anaphoric descriptions and the anchors (Fraurud,1990) of bridging ones.
Accordingly, we developedthree types of heuristics:, for resolving directly anaphoric descriptions.These iuclude heuristics for dealing with see-mentation and to handle modificatiou.?
for identifying discourse-new descriptions.Some of these heuristics attempt to recognizesemantically lunctional definite descriptions(Hawkins, 1978; Loebner, 1987), whereas oth-ers try to recognize definite descriptions thatare anchored via their modification (Clark andMarshall, 1981; Prince, 1981).,, for identifying the anchor of a bridging de-scription and the semantic relation between thebridging description and its anchor.
WordNetis accessed, and heuristics for named entityrecognition were also developed.The final configuration of the system was arrivedat on the basis of an extensive wfluation of thehemislics using Ihe corpus annotated in our previ-ous work (Poesio and Vieira, 1998).

E.g.,in our corpus we found that about 10% of directanal~horic detinite descriptions have more than onepossible antecedent if segmentalion is nol taken intoaccount (Vieira and Poesio, 1999).
Recognizingthe hierarchical structure of segments in a text is,howevm; still pretty umch an open problem, kS itinvolves reasoning about intentions; 2 better resultshave been achieved on the simpler task of 'chtlnk-ing' the text into approximate segments, generallyby means of lexical density measures (Hearst, 1997)In fact, the lnethods Io limit the lifespan of dis-course entity we considered for our system wereeven simplel: One type of heuristics we lookedat are window-based techniques, i.e., consideringas potential antecedents only the discourse ntitieswithin fixed-size windows of previous entences, al-lowing however for some discourse ntities to takea longer life span: we call this method LOOSE SEG-MENTATION.

considering indefinites, definites and posses-sives as potential antecedents (Vieira, 1998),4. the pmmodification of the description must becontained in the premodificatiou of the an-tecedent when the antecedeut has no premodi-tiers.3.2 Heuristics for Recognizing Discourse-NewDescriptionsAs mentioned above, a central characteristic of oursystem is that it also includes heuristics for recog-nising discourse-new descriptions (i.e., definite de-scriptions that introduce new discourse ntities) onthe basis of syntactic and lexical features of thenoun phrase.
Our heuristics are based on the dis-cussion by Hawkins (1978), who identified a num-ber of correlations between certain types of syntac-tic structure and discourse-new descriptions, par-ticularly those that he called 'unfamiliar' definites(i.e., those whose existence cannot be expected tobe known ou the basis of generally shared knowl-edge), including:?
the presence of 'special predicates':4- the occurrence of pre-modifiers uch asfirst or best when accompanied with fullrelatives, e.g., the .\[irs't peJwon to sailto America (Hawkius calls these 'un-explanatory modifiers'; Loebner (1987)showed how these predicates may licensethe use of definite descriptions in an ac-count of definite descriptions based onfunctionality);- a head noun taking a complement suchas the fact that there is li\['e on Earth(Hawkins calls this subclass 'Nt' comple-ments');?
the presence of restrictive modification, as inthe inequities of the current land-ownershipsystem.Our system attempts to recognize these syntacticpatterus; in addition, it considers as unfamiliar somedefinites occurring in4This list was developed by hand; more recently, Bean andRiloff (1999) proposed methods for autolnatically extractingfl'om a corpus uch special predicates, i.e., heads that correlatewell with discourse novelty.?
appositive coustructions (e.g., Glenn Cox, thepresident of Phillips Petroleum Co.);* copular constructions (e.g.,the man most likelyto gain custody of all this is a career politiciannamed David Dinkins).In our corpus study (Poesio and Vieira, 1998)we found that our subjects did better at ideutify-ing discourse-new descriptions all together (K=.68)than they did at distinguish 'unfamiliar' from 'largersituation' (Hawkins, 1978) cases (K = .63).
Thisfinding was confirmed by our implementation: al-though each of the heuristics is designed, in princi-ple, to identify only one of the uses (larger situationor unfamiliar), they work better when used all to-gether to the class of discourse new descriptions.The overall recall and precision results for theheuristics for identifying discourse new descriptionsare shown in Table 3.
In this Table we do not distin-guish between the two types of discourse-new de-scriptions, 'unfamiliar' and 'larger-situation'.
Thecolumn headed by (#) represents the number ofcases of descriptions classified as discourse new inthe standard annotation; + indicates the total num-ber of discourse-new descriptions correctly identi-fied; - the nmnber of errors.
These results are for theversion of the system (version 1) that uses the bestversion of the heuristics for dealing with anaphoricdescriptions discussed above, and that doesn't at-tempt o resolve bridging descriptions.I Discourse new l# \] + l -  I P" I P I F ITraining data 492 368 60 75% 86% 80%Test data 218 151 58 69% 72% 70%Table 3: Evaluation of the heuristics for identifyingdiscourse new descriptions3.3 Bridging DescriptionsBridging descriptions are tile class of definite de-scriptions which a shallow processing system isleast equipped to handle, and therefore the most cru-cial indicator of where commonsense knowledge isactually needed.
We knew from the start that ingeneral, a system can only resolve certain types ofbridging descriptions when supplied with an ade-quate kuowledge base; in fact, the typical way ofimplementing a system for resolving bridging ref-erences has been to restrict tim domain and feedthe system with hand-coded world knowledge (see,e.g., (Siduei; 1979) and especially (Carter, 1987)).902Furthermore, the relation between bridging descrip-tions and their anchors may be arbitrarily complex(Clark, 1977; Sidnm; 1979; Prince, 1981; Strand,1996) and our own results indicate that the stone de-scription may relate to different anchors in a text,which makes it difficult to decide what the intendedanchor and the intended link are (Poesio and Vieira,1998).
Nevertheless, we feel that trying to processthese definite descriptions is the only way to dis-cover which types of commonsense knowledge areactually needed..We began by developing a classilication of bridg-ing descriptions according to the kind of informa-tion needed to resolve them, rather than on the ba-sis of the possible relations between descriptionsand their anchors as usually done in the literature(Vieira, 1998).
This allowed us to get an ideaof what types of bridging descriptions our systemmight be able to resolve.
We classified definite de-scriptions as follows:?
cases based on well-delined lexical relations,such as synonymy, hypernymy and meronymy,that can be found in a lexical database such asWordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)-as in thef lat.
.
,  lheliving room;?
bridging descriptions in which the antecedentis a proper name and the description a commonnoun, whose resolution requires some way o1'recognizing the type of object denoted by theproper name (as in Bach ... the composer);?
cases in which the anchor is not the head nounbut a noun modifying an antecedent, as in thecompaw has been selling discount packages... the discounts?
cases in which the antecedent (anchor) is notintroduced by an NP but by a vl', as inKadane oil is currently drilling two oil wells.The activity...?
descriptions whose the antecedent is not ex-plicitly mentioned in the text, but is implicitlyavailable because it is a discourse topic-e.g.,the industo, in a text referring to oil coml)a-nies;?
cases in which the relation with the anchor isbased on more general commonsense knowl-edge, e.g., about cause-consequence relations.We developed heuristics for handling the firstthree of these classes: lexical bridges, bridges basedon names, and bridges to entities introduced by non-head nouns in a compound nominal.
We refer thereader to (Vieira, 1998) for discussion of the heuris-tics for this last class.Our system attempts to resolve lexical bridges byconsulting WordNet to determine if there is a se-mantic relation between the head noun of the de-scription and the head noun of one of the NI'S in theprevious five sentences.
The results of this searchfor our training corpus, in which 204 descriptionsare classified as bridging, are shown in Table 4.
It isinteresting to note that the semantic relations foundin this automatic semch were not always those ob-served in our manual analysis.BridgingClassSynonimyHyponimyMeronimySisterRelationsFound115930Total 106 30Right %Anchors Right4 36%18 30%2 33%6 20%28%Table 4: Ewduation of the search for anchors usingWordNetWe developed a simple heuristic method for as-signing types to named entities.
Our method iden-titied entity types for 66% (535/814) of all namesin the corpus (organizations, persons and locations).The precision was 95%.
We could have had a betterrecall if we had adopted more comprehensive listsof cue words, or consulted dictionaries of namesas done for the systems participating in MUC-6.There, recall in the named entity task varies t'rom82% to 96%, and precision l'rom 89% to 97%.
54 Overall Evaluation of the SystemThe order of application of heuristics is as impoftant as the heuristics themselves.
The final order ofapplication was also arrived at on the basis of an ex-tensive evaluation (Vieira, 1998), and is based onthe l'ollowing strategy: 65A more recent version o1' the system using the named en-tity recognition software developed by ItCRC for the MUC-7competition (Mikheev el al., 1999) is discussed in (Isbikawa,1998).aWe also attempted tolearn the best order of application ofthe heuristics automatically b  means of decision tree learn-ing algorithms (Quinlan, 1993), without however observing asignflicant difference in pcrfommnce.
