This problem is viewed aslabeling each character in FCRs of TCM witha pre-defined tag (?B-SYC?, ?I-SYC?
or ?O-SYC?)
to indicate the character?s role (a be-ginning, inside or outside part of a symptomname).
The task is handled by ConditionalRandom Fields (CRFs) based on two types offeatures.
The symptom name recognition F-Measure can reach up to 62.829% with recog-nition rate 93.403% and recognition error rate52.665% under our experiment settings.
Thefeasibility and effectiveness of the methodsand reasonable features are verified, and sev-eral interesting and helpful results are shown.A detailed analysis for recognizing symptomnames from FCRs of TCM is presentedthrough analyzing labeling results of CRFs.1 Introduction*Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a comple-mentary medical theory to western medicine, pro-vides a distinct way to view our human life (Pal,2002; Barnes, et al, 2004; Molassiotis, et al,2005).
Moreover, it has shown that TCMknowledge, which is accumulated in clinical prac-tice, has become one of the most important sourcesof modern biomedical research (Zhou, et al, 2010).
*Corresponding authorIn recent years, Data Mining and MachineLearning have been more than ever before appliedto TCM clinical research, such as establishingTCM diagnosis expert systems for supporting deci-sion making (Wang, et al, 2004; Huang and Chen,2007; Zhang, et al, 2008).
However, most of theworks are based on manually well-structured da-tasets.Because of the high cost of manually structuringand maintaining free-text clinical records (FCRs)of TCM, large volume of such datasets has notbeen exploited effectively (Zhou, et al, 2010), alt-hough they are significant for discovering newknowledge or capturing medical regularities.Therefore, developing appropriate information ex-traction methods for handling FCRs of TCM is anurgent need to reduce the manual labor for re-searchers.Automatically extracting meaningful infor-mation and knowledge from FCRs of TCM is chal-lenging in Data Mining and Machine Learningfields (Zhou, et al, 2010).
As the basis, symptomname recognition or extraction from FCRs of TCMis in an early stage.
To the best of our knowledge,there has little work to solve this problem (Wang,et al, 2010; Wang, et al, 2012).
Symptom namerecognition from FCRs of TCM was firstly at-tempted in (Wang, et al, 2010) through normaliz-ing the symptom names in clinical records basedon literal similarity and remedy-based similaritymethods but not directly recognizing original clini-cal symptom names from FCRs of TCM.
In 2012,Wang, et al proposed a framework of automaticdiagnosis of TCM for practice.
Symptom namerecognition is one part of the framework and simp-223ly attempted through a literal similarity methodwithout detailed analysis (summarized proceduresfor the previous wok are shown in figure 1).Figure 1.
Simple Conclusions of the Previous Work.Named Entity Recognition (NER) has beenwidely studied.
There have been lots of methodsfor Chinese NER (Zhang, et al, 2003; Wu, et al,2003; Gao, et al, 2005; Fu and Luke, 2005; Zhou,2006; Duan and Zhang, 2011).
However, thesemethods cannot be directly applied on symptomname recognition from FCRs of TCM due to bigdifferences of characteristics of the corpus (Wang,et al, 2012).
There are also several related work onEnglish NER, but Chinese NER has more chal-lenges because of the distinct characteristics ofChinese (Wu, et al, 2003).In this paper, the task of symptom name recog-nition from FCRs of TCM is studied.
The symp-tom names are recognized through finding theirdescription boundaries from FCRs of TCM, andthe method is described in section 2.
Several rea-sonable and helpful features are introduced forCRFs to label the characters in FCRs of TCM withpre-defined boundary tags to indicate their roles (abeginning, inside or outside part of a symptomname) (presented in section 3).
At last, several in-teresting and valuable experimental results areshown in section 4 and a conclusion is given insection 5.2 Symptom Name Recognition from FCRsof TCMThe task of symptom name recognition from FCRsof TCM can be treated as detecting the boundariesof the symptom name descriptions in the sentencesof FCRs of TCM.
Therefore, this task can beviewed as labeling each tagging unit (e.g.
word) inthe sentences with a pre-defined tag indicatingwhether the unit is a beginning, inside, or outsidepart of a symptom name.Generally, the tagging unit is word (Ramshawand Marcus, 1995).
However, there is no naturalsegmentation for words in Chinese sentences.Therefore, Chinese word segmentation problemhas to face up firstly (Gao, et al, 2005).
Because ofthe characteristics of FCRs of TCM (Wang, et al,2012), automatically segmenting FCRs of TCMinto words is not trivial and common Chinese wordsegmentation methods are not suitable.
In order totackle this problem, Chinese character is settled asthe basic tagging unit.
An example sentence of thelabeling task is shown in figure 2.Figure 2.
An Example Sentence of the Symptom NameRecognition Task.In figure 2, each character is labeled with a pre-defined tag (?B-SYC?, ?I-SYC?
or ?O-SYC?).
Themeaning of each tag is defined in table 1.Tag MeaningB-SYC Beginning of a TCM symptom nameI-SYC Inside a TCM symptom nameO-SYC Outside the TCM symptom namesTable 1.
Meanings of the Pre-defined Tags.Consequently, a recognized symptom nameshould start with a character labeled with ?B-SYC?and end before the character whose correspondinglabel changes from ?I-SYC?
to ?B-SYC?
or ?O-SYC?
for the first time.
The labeling task can beformulated as follows:Given a FCR1 2x ,x ,...,xn?x , where x i  is aChinese character, the goal is to build a annotatorp  to accurately label x  with the credible corre-sponding tag sequence ( )p?y x , where1 2= y ,y ,..., yny  and y {B-SYC,I-SYC,O-SYC}n ?
.This task can be effectively done by CRFs (Shaand Pereira, 2003) based on a training datasetwhich is consisted of pairs of sequences ( , )x y .2243 Conditional Random Fields for Symp-tom Name Recognition3.1 Conditional Random FieldsA Conditional Random Field can be defined as anundirected graphical model (see figure 3) whichconsists of a sequence of vertices representing ran-dom variables1 2( , ,..., )nY Y Y?Y  and edges repre-senting conditional dependencies, conditioned on1 2( , ,..., )nX X X?X .
The random variable iY  onlyhas edges with its predecessor1iY ?
and successor1iY ?
, thus, random variables 1 2, ,..., nY Y Y  obey theMarkov property and form a linear Markov chain.Figure 3.
An Undirected Graphical Structure for a Con-ditional Random Field.Then the conditional probability of a label se-quence given an input sequence can be defined as:1exp ( , , )( , )( )niipZ????

Weuse the CRF++ tool in the experiments, which pro-vides an efficient implementation for CRFs by us-ing the limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithmfor training the models (Sha and Pereira, 2003;Lafferty, et al, 2001) and the default settings ofCRF++ are used.3.2 Features for LabelingIt is difficult to analyze the syntactic structure ofthe content in FCRs of TCM which has narrativeform, concise style and nonstandard descriptioncharacteristics.
Therefore, no higher level syntacticfeatures, such as POS tags or NP chunks, can beused at the moment.
Through analyzing FCRs ofTCM, two types of representative and reasonablefeatures (i.e.
literal features and positional features)are exploited.
The features are introduced and theirreasonableness is explained by examples as fol-lows.Literal Features: the simplest and the most ob-vious features for determining the boundaries ofsymptom name descriptions are literal features.
Forexample, according to the observation that after aword which is used to specify time (e.g.
????
(yesterday)) there would usually follow a symptomname description, such as ????
(borborygmus).The best approach to get such features is to di-vide the content of FCRs of TCM into words.However, as described before, Chinese word seg-mentation is not trivial work.
Fortunately, seg-menting the content into n-grams is considerableand reasonable, because the indicating wordswould be mixed in the n-gram segments and couldbe helpful to determine the boundaries of symptomname descriptions.Furthermore, the FCRs of TCM have a concisestyle, i.e.
the length of the clauses in FCRs of TCMis short and words are usually used in their briefform.
Therefore, the n-grams as the literal featuresneed not be too long.
In general, the average lengthof a Chinese word approximates 2 (Nie, et al,2000).
Consequently, the value of n  should set torange from 1 to 3.
Moreover, according to the intu-ition that ?the distance between current characterand its related n-grams in FCRs of TCM would notbe too far?, the context window size, which is thefragment scope picking up literal features (i.e.
n-225grams (see examples in table 2)) in FCRs of TCM,would not be too large.
Otherwise it would bringabout noisy information, thereby reducing the la-beling precision.
The context window size in ourexperiment is specified smaller then 4.FeatureTypeContext WindowSize (CWS)Literal feature examplesunder different CWSUnigramFeatures(Uni)1 Ci-1, Ci, Ci+12 Ci-2, Ci-1, Ci, Ci+1, Ci+23Ci-3, Ci-2, Ci-1, Ci,Ci+1, Ci+2, Ci+34Ci-4, Ci-3, Ci-2, Ci-1,Ci, Ci+1, Ci+2, Ci+3, Ci+4BigramFeatures(Big)1 Ci-1Ci, Ci Ci+12Ci-2Ci-1, Ci-1Ci,CiCi+1, Ci+1Ci+23Ci-3Ci-2, Ci-2Ci-1, Ci-1Ci,CiCi+1, Ci+1Ci+2, Ci+2Ci+34Ci-4Ci-3, Ci-3Ci-2, Ci-2Ci-1,Ci-1Ci, CiCi+1, Ci+1Ci+2,Ci+2Ci+3, Ci+3Ci+4TrigramFeatures(Tri)1 Ci-1CiCi+12Ci-2Ci-1Ci, Ci-1CiCi+1,CiCi+1Ci+23Ci-3Ci-2Ci-1, Ci-2Ci-1Ci,Ci-1CiCi+1, CiCi+1Ci+2,Ci+1Ci+2Ci+34Ci-4Ci-3Ci-2Ci-1,Ci-3Ci-2Ci-1Ci,Ci-2Ci-1CiCi+1,Ci-1CiCi+1Ci+2,CiCi+1Ci+2Ci+3,Ci+1Ci+2Ci+3Ci+4Table 2.
Literal Feature Examples Used in the Experi-ments.
Ci is the character at current position i in oneclause.Positional Features: positions of characters inFCRs of TCM are also helpful.
They are assistantfeatures to determine the boundaries of symptomname descriptions.The start of a sentence would be usually a com-mon character (i.e.
its corresponding label is ?O-SYC?)
rather than the beginning of a symptomname description.
On the contrary, the starting po-sitions of the following clauses have higher proba-bilities to be labeled with ?B-SYC?.
Taking theFCR ????
?, ??
?, ?????
(Yesterday,the patient had borborygmus and more farting, andhis/her heart was uncomfortable) as an example, itstarts with a common word ????
(yesterday)followed by a symptom name ????
(borboryg-mus).
And at the same time, following clauses allstart with symptom name descriptions.The example of positional features is shown infigure 4.Figure 4.
Example of Positional Features.In figure 4, one ?[SubSID-POS]?
represents apositional feature, and SubSID is the index of cur-rent clause in a FCR and POS indicates the posi-tion of a character in current clause.4 ExperimentsIn this section, the proposed method for symptomname recognition from TCM FCRs is evaluated,and the usefulness of the introduced features isverified based on a TCM clinical dataset.
The re-sults are depicted bellow.4.1 Experimental DatasetsIn this paper, a clinical record dataset (CRD) isused.
It contains 11613 FCRs of TCM and wascollected by TCM doctors during their routine di-agnostic work.
The Chinese characters in FCRs ofCRD are annotated with tags ?B-SYC?, ?I-SYC?,and ?O-SYC?.
The number of each type of tags is69193, 104243 and 142860, respectively.
There are4235 unique symptom names in CRD, and theamount of annotated symptom names is 69193.TrainingDataTestDataNumber of Unique SymptomNames1813 3463Amount of Symptom Names 17339 51854Number of Each Type of Tags(?B-SYC?, ?I-SYC?, ?O-SYC?
)17339,25738,3599551854,78505,106865Table 3.
Detailed Information of the Training and TestDatasets.CRD is divided into two sub-datasets (i.e.
atraining dataset (3483 FCRs, 25% of CRD) and atest dataset (8130 FCRs, 75% of CRD)).
For con-226venience, all numbers (e.g.
integers, decimals andfractions, etc.)
in CRD are uniformly replaced by aEnglish character ?N?
in advance.
Detailed infor-mation of training and test datasets is listed in table3.4.2 Evaluation MetricsA new method for symptom name recognitionfrom FCRs of TCM is proposed and two types offeatures are introduced.
To evaluate the feasibilityand effectiveness of the method and features, twogroups of evaluation metrics are designed: (1) forassessing the ability of symptom name recognition,symptom name recognition rate, recognition errorrate and recognition F-Measure are defined; (2) forgiving a detailed analysis, the labeling precision,recall, and F-Measure are exercised.
The detailedexplanations of these metrics are described below.Symptom name recognition rate (RRdet),recognition error rate (RERdet) and recognitionF-Measure (RFMdet): these metrics are designedfor assessing capability of the proposed method forsymptom name recognition from TCM FCRs.
Ifand only if the boundary of a symptom name islabeled accurately (i.e.
starting with ?B-SYC?
andending with the first change from ?I-SYC?
to ?B--SYC?
or ?O-SYC?
), the recognized symptomname is correct.
Higher RRdet and lower RERdet areachieved; better symptom name recognition per-formance RFMdet would be obtained.
RRdet, RERdetand RFMdet are formulated as follows.| || |detNSDCRR NCS?| | | || |detSD NSDCRER SD?
?2 (1 )1det detdetdet detDR DERRFM DR DER?
?
??
?
?Where | |NSDC  is the number of symptomname recognized correctly from the test dataset,| |NCS  is the number of clinical symptom namesin the test dataset, and | |SD  is the number ofsymptom name recognized.Labeling precision (Prelab), recall (Reclab) andF-Measure (FMlab): the metrics (Prelab, Reclab andFMlab) are used to evaluate the performance of la-beling Chinese character sequences of FCRs ofTCM for giving a detailed analysis.
They are de-fined below.| || |labNCLCPre NCL?| || |labNCLRec NC?2 lab lablablab labPre RecFM Pre Rec?
??
?Where | |NCLC  is the number of characters la-beled correctly with their corresponding tags,| |NCL  is the number of characters labeled withtags, and | |NC  is the number of characters shouldbe labeled.4.3 Evaluation of Symptom Name Recogni-tion AbilityComprehensive evaluations of symptom namerecognition ability using CRFs with reasonablefeatures are shown in figure 5, 6 and 7.
These fig-ures show that CRFs with reasonable features forsymptom name recognition from FCRs of TCM isfeasible.
The best RFMdet 62.829% (RRdet 93.403%and RERdet 52.665%) is achieved under settingsCWS 3?
and features Uni+Big+Tri used.Figure 5.
Symptom Name Recognition Rate.It obviously shows in figures 5, 6 and 7 that lit-eral features and positional features are helpful tosymptom name recognition from FCRs of TCM.More types of features are used; better recognitionperformance would be obtained in most cases.When CWS 1?
and referred features changedfrom unigram literal features to the combination ofunigram and bigram literal features, the highestgrowth about 3.925% of RFMdet is achieved (the227RRdet increases from 87.586% to 93.034% and theRERdet decreases from 56.173% to 53.118%).Figure 6.
Symptom Name Recognition Error Rate.Figure 7.
Symptom Name Recognition F-Measure.As described previously, the context informationis helpful to symptom name recognition.
However,the context window size should not be too large.
Infigures 5, 6 and 7, it clearly shows that when CWSincrease RRdet and RFMdet are improved andRFMdet is reduced.
When CWS grows too large(larger than 3 here), RRdet and RFMdet begin, never-theless, to descend and RERdet is raised in mostevery cases.Moreover, positional features are complemen-tary features to literal features for symptom namerecognition from FCRs of TCM.
It vividly showsin figures 5, 6 and 7 that RRdet and RFMdet wouldbe improved and RERdet would be reduced more orless when literal features combined with positionalfeatures.
The highest elevation can reach 0.297% ifthe combination features of trigram literal featuresand positional features are used and CWS 1?
.4.4 Evaluation of Labeling Performance andDetailed Analysis for Symptom NameRecognitionIn this part, firstly, an evaluation for labeling per-formance is given, and then a detailed analysis forsymptom name recognition from FCRs of TCMusing CRFs with reasonable features would be de-scribed.The results of Prelab and FMlab under differentsituations are shown in figure 8 and 9, respectively.The Reclab here are all 100%.
It can be seen fromthese figures that the FMlab can reach nearly up to97.596% with corresponding Prelab 95.305%.
Theresults can also demonstrate the feasibility of theproposed method for symptom name recognitionfrom FCRs of TCM and the worth of the repre-sentative and reasonable features introduced in thispaper.
The properties of literal features and posi-tional features, which are just described in section4.3, are also reflected in figures 8 and 9.Figure 8.
Results of Prelab under Different Situations.Figure 9.
Results of FMlab under Different Situations.Although RRdet can achieve a very high perfor-mance, however, RERdet is also too high.
In figures8 and 9, high labeling results was gotten.
It impliesthat the probable position of the symptom namecan be found in TCM FCRs, but the exact bounda-ries of the symptom name descriptions cannot bedetected accurately yet.More careful results are listed in table 4.
In thistable, the average labeling Prelab of labels ?B-228SYC?
and ?O-SYC?
are always higher than theglobal average precision, but the average Prelab of?I-SYC?
is lower than the global average precision.It implies that the performance of labeling the endposition of a symptom name description is worsethan the other position?s.
In other words, the judg-ment on whether ?I-SYC?
or ?O-SYC?
is moredifficult.
Therefore, as the future work, how to ac-curately determine the end of a symptom namedescription should be paid more attention to.CWS = 1 CWS = 2 CWS = 3 CWS = 4GlobalP94.186% 94.526% 94.616% 94.540%BP 95.184% 95.472% 95.519% 95.429%R 94.135% 94.243% 94.238% 94.113%F 94.656% 94.853% 94.873% 94.765%IP 93.085% 93.586% 93.772% 93.713%R 93.791% 94.181% 94.267% 94.201%F 93.434% 93.879% 94.016% 93.953%OP 94.533% 94.781% 94.819% 94.738%R 94.501% 94.916% 95.056% 94.996%F 94.514% 94.845% 94.934% 94.864%Table 4.

Through the experi-ments, the specialties, usage and effectiveness ofthe introduced features are verified.In future, particular syntactic structure andgrammatical rules for FCRs of TCM need to bedefined and studied based on the characteristics ofFCRs of TCM.
On the one hand, they can help theTCM doctors and researchers to understand theclinical records deeper (Spasic, et al, 2005; Zhou,et al, 2010), and on the other hand, technically,they are good for filtering and reducing feature sizeand providing basics and adequate evidence forsymptom name normalization process and auto-matic diagnosis procedure.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank M.S.
