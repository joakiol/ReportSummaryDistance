Constituent Coordination in Lexieal-Functional GrammarRonald M. KAPLAN and J ohn  T. MAXWELL I l lXerox Pale Alto Research Centeraaaa Coyote Hill RoadPale Alto, California 94304 USAAhstract :  This paper outlines a theory of constituent coordination Forl,exicaI-Funetional Grammar.
On this theory LFG's flat, unstructurednets are used as the functional representation of coordinateconstructions, l"unction application is extended to sets by treating a settbrmally am the generalization of its Functional clmnents.
This causesproperties attributed externally to a coordinate structure to beuniformly distributed across its elements, without requir ing additionalgrammatical  specifications.lntroduetio,~A proper t reammnt of coordination has long been an elusive goal of bothtlmoretical and computational pln'oaches to language.
The originaltransformational formulation in terms of the Coordinate Reduction rule(e.g./1)ougherty 1970/) was quickly shown to have many theoretical andempirical inadequacies, and only recently have linguistic theories (e.gGPSG/Gazdar ct al.
1985/, Catcgorial granmmr (e.g./Steedman 1985/)made substantial progress on eharactm'izing the complex restrictions oncoordinate constructions and also on their smnantic intertn'etations.Coordination has also presented escriptive problems for emnputationalapproaches.
Typically these have been solved by special devices that areadded to the parsing algorithms to analyze coordinate constructionsthat cannot easily be characterized in explicit rules of grmnmar.
Thebest known examples of this kind of approach are SYSCONJ /Woods1973/, LSP/Sager 1981/, and MSG/l)ahl and McCord 19831.Coordination phenomena re usually divided into two classes, tbeso-called constituent coordinations where the coordinated elements hmklike otherwise well-motivated phrasal constituents 111. andnoneonstituent coordinatiofi where the coordinated elements look likefragments of pl)rasal constituents (2).
(1) (a) A girl saw Mary and ran to Bill.
(Com'dinated verb phrases)(b) A girl saw and heard Mary.
(Com'dinated verbs}(2) Bill wenL to Chicago on Wednesday and New York on Thursday.Of course, what is or is not a well-motivated constituent depends on thedetails of the particular grammatical  theory Constituents intransformationally-oriented heories, For example, are units thatsimplify the feeding relations of transformational rules, whereas"constituents" in eategorial grammars merely reflect he order of binarycombination.~; and have no other special motivation.
In lexical-functional grammar, sm'faee constituents are taken to be the units oft)honological interpretation.
These nmy differ markedly frmn the unitsof functional or semantic interpretation, as shown in the analysis ofDutch cross serial dependencies given by/Bresnan et al 1982/.Noneonstituent coordination, of course, presents a wide variety ofcomplex and difficult descriptive problems, but constituent coordinationalso raises important l inguistic issues.
It is the latter that we focus onin this brief paper.To a first ai)proximation, constituent coordinations can be analyzed asthe result  of taking two independent clauses and factoring out theircomnmn subl)arts.
The verb coordination in (lb) is thus related to theFuller sentence coordination in (3).
This intuition, which was the basisof the Coordinate Reduction Transformation, accounts for more emnplexpatterns of acceptabil ity such am (4) i l lustrates.
The coordination in/4e)is acceptable because both (4a) and (4b) are, while (4e) is bad because ofthe independent subeategorization violation in (4d)(3) A girl saw Mary and a girl heard Mary.
(4) (a) A girl dedicated a pie to Bill.
(b) A girl gave a pie to Bill.
(c) A girl dedicated and gave a pie to Bill.
(d) *A gM ate a pie to Bill.
(e) *A girl dedicated and ate a pie to Bill.This first approximation is frought with difficulties.
It ensures thatconstituents of l ike categories can be conjoined only if they share somefiner details of specification, but there are more subtle conditions that itdoes not cover.
For example, even though (5a) and (5b) are bothindependently grammatical ,  the coordination i  (5c) is unacceptable:(5) (a) The girl promised John to go.
(b) The gM persuaded John to go.
(c) *The girl promised and persuaded John to go.IHint: Who isg'oing 9)Another welbknown difficulty with this approach is that it does notobviously allow for the necessary semantic distinctions to be made, onthe assumption that the semantic properties of reduced coordinationsare to be explicated in terms of the semantic representations of thepropositional coordinations that they are related to.
This is i l lustratedby the contrasting semantic entai lments in (6): Sentence (6a) allows forthe possibility that two different girls are involved while (6b) impliesthat a single (but indefinite) girl performed both actions.
(6) (a) A girl saw Mary and a girl talked to Bill.
(b) A girl saw Mary and talked to Bill.l)espite its deficiencies, it has not been easy to find a satisfactoryalternative to this first approximation.
The theoretical challenge is toembed coordimttion in a grammatical  system in a way that isindependent of the other generalizations that are being expressed legaetives correspond to passives, NP's in English can be (bliowed byrelative clauses, English relative clauses look like S's with a missingNP) hut which interacts with those specifications in just the right ways.That is, a possible but unacceptable solution to this descriptive di lemmawould be to add to the grammar new versions of all the basic rulesdesigned specifically to account br the vagaries ofcoor(tination.Coordination was not discussed in the original tbrmulation of{,exicaM"nnctional Grammar /Kaplan & lh'esnan 1982/, althoughmathematical  objects (finite sets of f-structures) were introduced toprovide an underlying representation for grammatical constructionswhich, like the parts of a coordination, do not seem to obey theuniqueness conditiml that normally applies to grammatical functionsand features.
Adjuncts and other modifying constructions are the m~,ioro~tample of this that Kapleln and Brcsnan discussed, but they alsosuggested that the same nmthenmtical representations might also beused in the analysis of coordinatim~ l)henomena.
In the present paperwe extend the I,FG formalism to provide a simple account ofcoordination that Follows along the general ines of the Kaplan/Bresnansuggestion and does not involve detailed specifications of thecoordination properties of particular constituents.
We i l lustrate theconsequences of this extension by discussing a small mnnber ofgrammatical  constructions; Bresnan, Kaplan, end Peterson(forthcoming) discuss a much wider range of phenomena nd providemore general l inguistic motivation tbr this approach.Simple CoordinationA lexical-functional grammar assigns two syntactic levels ofrepresentation to each grammatical  str ing in a language.
Theconstituent structure, or c-structure, is a convemtiona\[ lree thaLindicates tbc organization of surface wm'ds and phrases, while thefimctienal structure (gstrueturc) is a hierarchy nfattr ibutes and valuesthat represents the grammatical  functions and features of the sentence.MeG assumes as a basic aximn that there is a piecewise function, calleda structural correspondence or "pro.iection" , that maps from the nodes inthe e-structure to the units in an abstract f-structure (see/Kaplan &Bresnan i982/ and /Kaplan 1987/ lbr details).
This means that theproperties of the f-structure can be specified in terms of themother-daughter and precedence relations in the c-structure, eventhough the f-structure is formally not at all a tree-like structure.Now let us consider a simple example of coordination wherein twosentences are conjoined together (7).
A plausible c-structure for thissentence is given in (8), and we propose (9) to represent the fnnctionalproperties of this sentence.
(7) John bought apples and John ate apples.
(8) (9)SS CONJ SNP VP and NP VP1 1 AN V NP N V NPI 1 1 I I IJohn bought N John ate NI Iapples applesII)R ED 'BUY<\[JOHN\], \[AppLE\]> ;TENSE PASTpREP ~JOHNqSUBJ LNUM SG \]pRED 'APPLE\]OBJ LNUM PLPRED 'EAT<\[JOHN\],\[APPLE\]> ~TENSE PASTp,ED 'JO.N 7SUBJ LNUM SG \]~RED 'APPLE~OBJ LNUM PL303The structure in (9) is a set containing the f-structures that correspondto the component sentences of the coordination.
(We use brackets with aline at the center to denote set objects.)
As Bresnan, Kaplan, andPeterson (forthcoming) observe, sets constitute a plausible formalrepresentation for coordination since an unlimited number of items canbe conjoined in a single construction and none of those items dmninatesor has scope over the others.
Neither particular functional attributesnor recursive embeddings of attr ibutes can provide the appropriaterepresentation that fiat, unstructured sets allow?To obtain the representation &coordination shown in (8) and (9), all weneed is the following alternative way of expanding S:(10) S ~ S CONJ SThis rule says that a conjoined sentence consists of a sentence followedby a conjunction followed by another sentence, where the 5structures ofeach sub sentence is an element of the f-structure that represents theircoordination.Coordination with DistributionThe next step is to consider constituent coordinations where some partsof the sentence are shared by the coordinated constituents.
Consider thefollowing sentence:( 11 ) John bought and ate apples?
(12) (13)sNP VPN V NPJohn V CONJ V NI I I lbought and ate applesPRED 'BUY<\[JOHN\],\[APPLE\]>~ITENSE PAST " \]\]pREO 'APP,.Eq IIpREB 'JONNq \ 1 1~REO 'EAT<\[JOHNI,FPP~ ITENSE ~ l \ ]  \]BJ5UBJThe desired c-structure and f-structure for (11) are shown in (12) and(13) respectively?
Notice that the subjects and objects of BUY and EATare linked, so that the f-structure is different from the one in (9) forJohn bought apples and John ate apples.
The identity l inks in thisstructure account for the different semantic entaihnents ofsentences (7)and (11) as well as \['or the differences in (da)" and (db).
'\['his is an example of verb coordination, so the following alternative isadded to the grammar:(14) V -)  V CONJ VThis rule permits the appropriate c-structure configuration but itsfunctional specifications are no different than the ones for simplesententia\[ coordination.
\[low then do the l inks in (13) arise?
The basicdescriptive device of the LFG formalism is the function applicationexpression:(15) (fa) = vAs originally formulated by /Kap lan  and Bresnan 1982l, this equatmn(15) holds if and only if f denotes an f-structure which yields the value vwhen applied to the attr ibute a.
According to the oi iginal definition, thevalue of an application expression is undefined when f denotes a set off-structures instead of a single function and an equation such as (15)would therefore be false.
Along with Bresnan, Kaplan, and Peterson(forthcoming), we propose extending the function-application device sothat it is defined for sets of functions.
If s denotes a set of functions, wesay that (s a )=v  holds if and only if v is the generalization of all theelements ors applied to a:(16) (sa) = N (fa), for all fEsThe generalization flrlf2 of two functions or f-structures fL and f2 isdefined recursively as follows:(17) Iff l  = \[?
then flFIf2 = fl.
I f f l  and f2 are f-structures, thenf~rlf2 = {<a, (/el a)H(f2 a)>l a (DOM(fl)NDOM(f2) }The generalization is the greatest lower bound in the subsumptionordering on the f-structure lattice.These definitions have two consequences.
The first is that v subsumes(fa) for all f ( s. Thus the properties a serted on a set as a whole must be :distributed across the elements of the set.
This explains why the subjectand object of (11) are distributed across both verbs without having tochange the VP rule in (18).
The equations on the object NP of(18) saysthat ( \]" OBJ) = $.
The meta.variable " 1' " denotes a set because theLstructure of the VP node is the same as the f-structure of the conjoinedV node, which by (14) is a set.
Therefore the effect of rule (18) is thateach of the elements of the 1' will have an OBJ attribute whose value issubsumed by the f-structure corresponding to apples.
(18) V ~ V NP,1, = t ( t  oBJ) = $The second consequence of (16) is that v takes on the attr ibutes andvalues that all of the (fa) have in common.
This is useful in explainingthe ungrammatical i ty of the promise and persuade sentence in (4).
(Weare indebted to Andreas Eisele and Stefan Momma for call ing ourattention to this example.)
The analysis for this sentence is in (20) and(2l):(19) *The girl promised and persuaded John to go(20) sNP VPPET N V NP VP'The girl V CONJ V N TO VPl l l I I Ipromised and persuaded John to VIgo(21) T~NE D ' PERSUADEK\[GIRL\], \[JOHN\], EGO\]> eTENSE PASTpRED 'GIRLqINUM SG /SUBj \[SPEC THE J ~pREO'JOHNq ~.

PROMISE and PERSUADE share an object, a subject, and a verbcomplement.
The verb complements have different subjects as a resultof the different control equations for PROMISE and PERSUADE (The lexicalentry for PROMISE specifies ubject control ( 1' VCOMPSUBJ) = ( ~ SUBJ),while PERSUADE specifies object control ( 1' VCOMP SUBJ) = ( ~' OBJ)).There is no inconsistency, incompleteness or incoimrence in thisstructure.However, in LFG the completeness conditions apply to the f-structuresmapped from all the c-structure nodes, whether or not they are part ofthe structure corresponding to the root node.
And if we look at thef-structure that corresponds to the verb-complement node, we discoverthat it is incomplete:(22) fRED 'GO(\[ \]>3\] pu.J pRE0 Wu.This f-structure is the generalization of (s VCOMP) for the set given in(21).
Everything that the two VCOMPs have in common is given by thisf-structure?
HOwever, it is incomplete in a very important way: thesubject of the f-structure has no predicate.
This is the "semanticcompleteness" condition of LFG, which requires that every thematicfunction of a predicate must itself have a predicate.
If the VCOMPs hadhad a subject in common (as in the sentence The girl urged andpersuaded John to go) then the sentence would have been perfectlylegal.Interactions with Long-Distance DependenciesUnder certain circumstances a shared constituent plays different rolesin the conjoined constituents.
For instance, in (23) The robot is theobject for Bill gave Mary, and it is the oblique object for John gave a bailto.304(23) The robot |,hat Bill gave Mary and Jobn gave a ball toThis variati~m reelects a nmre general uncertainty about what role timhead of a relative clause can play in the relative clause, lent .

With flmctional uncertainty the attributeo1' a functional equation is allowed 1o consist of u (possibly infinite)regular .
';el of attr ibute strings.
For instance, normally the role that acnnstituetJt plays in the tLqtructure is given by a simple equation such as(25):(25) (/'~ o~,J) :- feA functionally uncel'tain equation that couhl be used to express therelationship between the head of a relative clause and the role that itplays i .

The uncertainty can be ~ealized by a differentlhnetional path in each of the coordinated elmnents, but the uncertaintymust be res(flved somehow in eacb clement and Ufis accounts for theSun|l iar Across tim Board and Coordinate Structure Constraints.l~epresent ing the Col*junctionWe have not yet indicated how the identity of the particular conjunctionis represented.
If we look at rule (14) again, we notice that it is rnissingany equation to tell us how the f-structure for CONJ is related to ~ :(29) V - ;  V CONJ V,l, ~ 1" ?
; ( tIt" we replace the ?
with 1~ = ~, then the f-structure tbr CON,I will beidentified wiih the set corresponding to 1', which will have the effect ofdistributing all of its information across the f-structures correspondingto the eonjoi~ed verbs.
As was pointed out to us by researchers at tileUniversity of Manchester (UM1ST), this arrangmnent leads toinconsistencies when coordinations of' different types (and vs. or) arcmutually end)cdded.
On the other hand, if we replace the ?
with $ E 1',then the f-structure tbr CONJ will be another element of tile set, on a parwith the f..strnctures corresponding to the conjoined verbs.
This isclearly counterintuitive and also erroneously implies that the sharedelements will be distributed across the conjunction as well as theelements of the set.We observe, however, that the identity of the particular conjunctiondoes not seem to enter into any syntactic or t ime|lanai generalizations,and therefor:.
', that there is no motivation fro' including it in thefunctional structure at all.
Instead, it is necessary to encode thish/errant|on only on the semantic level of representation, as defined by as:emantic st, rltctural correspondence or "prnjeetion"/Kaplan 1987/.
Aprojection is a piecewise fimction mapping from the units of one kind ofstructure to the urtits of another.
The projection that is most central toI,FG theory is the 0 projection, the one that maps from constituentstructure nodes into functional structures.
But other projections arcbeing introduced into I,FG theory so that generalizations about variousother subsystems of l inguistic information can be formalized.
Inpart icular, / \[ lalvorsen andKaplan 1988/have discussed the o projectionthat maps frmn f-structures into a range of semantic structures.
Giventhe projection concept, the various linguistic levels can be related to oneanother through "codescription", that is, the equations that describe themapping between gstructures and s-structures (semantic structures)are generated in terms of the same c-structure node configurations asthe equations that map between c-structures and f-structures.
Thismeans that even though the s-structure is mapped from the f-structure,it may contain irfformation that is not computable from the f-structurebut is strongly correlated with it via codescription.
We exploit thispossibility to encode the identity of the conjunction only in semanticstrnctllrC.Consider a modified version of (29) that has equations describing thesemantic structures corresponding to the f-structure units:(30) Y --> V CONJ VO\]v ~(O'~ ARGS) (O1' REL)=o~, o~ (\[(O~ ARGS)Rule (30) says that the unit of semantic structure corresponding to thef-st~,ucture of the conjoined verb contains the conjunction as its mainrelation (RI,;L), plus an ARGS set that is made tip of the semanticstructures corresponding to the individual V's.
The semantic structuregenerated by (30) is something like this:It describes the conjoined verb as a relation, aND, which is applied to aset of arguments consisting of the relation SI,EEI' and the relation EAT.Each of these relations also has arguments, the semantic structurescorresponding to the shared subject and object ef the sentence.
Noticehow this structure differs from the one that we find at the functionallevel (e.g.
(13)).
Rule (30) does not assign any functional role to theconjunction, yet al the necessary syntactic and semantic information isavailable in the complex of corresponding structures assigned to thesentence.ReferencesBresnan, J., Kaplan, R. M., and Peterson, P. Forthcoming.
