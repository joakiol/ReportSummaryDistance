This growth, in part, has been fueled bythe needs of a large number of people in the world who are learning and using a second or foreignlanguage.
For example, it is estimated that there are currently over one billion people who are non-nativewriters of English.
These numbers drive the demand for accurate tools that can help learners to writeand speak proficiently in another language.
Such demand also makes this an exciting time for those inthe NLP community who are developing automated methods for grammatical error correction (GEC).Our motivation for the COLING tutorial is to make others more aware of this field and its particular setof challenges.
For these reasons, we believe that the tutorial will potentially benefit a broad range ofconference attendees.In general, there has been a surge in interest in using NLP to address educational needs, which in turn,has spawned the recurring ACL/NAACL workshop ?Innovative Use of Natural Language Processingfor Building Educational Applications?
that had its 9th edition at ACL 2014.
The last three years, inparticular, have been pivotal for GEC.
Papers on the topic have become more commonplace at mainconferences such as ACL, NAACL and EMNLP, as well as two editions of a Morgan Claypool SynthesisSeries book on the topic (Leacock et al., 2010; Leacock et al., 2014).
In 2011 and 2012, the first sharedtasks in GEC (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011; Dale et al., 2012) were created, and dozens of teams from allover the world participated.
This was followed by two successful CoNLL Shared Tasks on the topic in2013 and 2014 (Ng et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2014).While there have been many exciting developments in GEC over the last few years, there is stillconsiderable room for improvement as state-of-the-art performance in detecting and correcting severalimportant error types is still inadequate for real world applications.
We hope to engage researchers fromother NLP fields to develop novel and effective approaches to these problems.
Our tutorial is specificallydesigned to:?
Introduce an NLP audience to the challenges that language learners face and thus the challenges ofdesigning NLP tools to assist in language acquisition?
Provide a history of GEC and the state-of-the-art approaches for different error types?
Show the need for multi-lingual error correction approaches and discuss novel methods for achiev-ing this?
Discuss ways in which error correction techniques can have an impact on other NLP tasksThis work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

ConclusionsOrganizersJoel Tetreault is a Senior Research Scientist at Yahoo Labs in New York City.
His research focus isNatural Language Processing with specific interests in anaphora, dialogue and discourse processing,machine learning, and applying these techniques to the analysis of English language learning and au-tomated essay scoring.
Previously he was Principal Manager of the Core Natural Language group atNuance Communications, Inc. where he worked on the research and development of NLP tools andcomponents for the next generation of intelligent dialogue systems.
Prior to Nuance, he worked at Ed-ucational Testing Service for six years as a Managing Senior Research Scientist where he researchedautomated methods for detecting grammatical errors by non-native speakers, plagiarism detection, andcontent scoring.
Tetreault received his B.A.
in Computer Science from Harvard University (1998) andhis M.S.
and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Rochester (2004).
He was also a post-doctoral research scientist at the University of Pittsburgh?s Learning Research and Development Center(2004-2007), where he worked on developing spoken dialogue tutoring systems.
In addition he has co-organized the Building Educational Application workshop series for 7 years, the CoNLL 2013 SharedTask on Grammatical Error Correction, and is currently NAACL Treasurer.Claudia Leacock is a Research Scientist at McGraw-Hill Education CTB who has been working onusing NLP in educational applications for 20 years focusing on automated scoring and grammatical er-ror detection.
She was previously a consultant for Microsoft Research where she collaborated on thedevelopment of ESL Assistant: a web-based prototype tool for detecting and correcting grammatical er-rors of English language learners.
As a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff at Pearson Knowledge9Technologies, and previously as a Principal Development Scientist at Educational Testing Service, shedeveloped tools for automated assessment of short-response content-based questions and for grammati-cal error detection.
As a member of the WordNet group at Princeton University?s Cognitive Science Lab,her research focused on word sense disambiguation.
Dr. Leacock received a B.A.
in English from NYU,a Ph.D. in Linguistics from the City University of New York, Graduate Center and was a post-doctoralfellow at IBM, T.J. Watson Research Center.ReferencesRobert Dale and Adam Kilgarriff.
