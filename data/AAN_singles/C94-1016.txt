The sys-tem follows the transfer approach to MT.
Limited sofar to lexico-morphologieal processing, it is seen asa foundation for more ambitious linguistic research.The system is implemented on IBM PC, MS DOS,in Arity Prolog (analysis and transfer) and TurboPascal (synthesis).1 Theoretical  backgroundThe development of the Jall.AP experimental sys-tem was preceded by a long period of purelytheoretic research into various aspects of natu-ral language ~'td its functioning in translatio~t(see, e.g., (Shalyaplna~lO80a,1980b,1988)).
Some ofthe basic principles which have evolved from this re-search may be summarized ~m follows.
(1) The most adequate scheme for simulating hu-man translation ~ctlvity is doubtless the transfer one.
(2) The level of transfer and the volume of struc-tural and semantic information explicitly representedat this level should be determined experimentally asa compromise between the demands for translationadequacy under the given conditions and the advan-tages of "shortcuts" permitted by the superficial cor-respondences between the languages concerned.
(3) Semantics is not in itself a level of linguisticrepresentation, but rather part of linguistic descrip-tion at any level of representation f linguistic units.
(4) In its semantic aspects, syntax is dependent onlexicon to a greater extent han vice versa.
(5) A model aimed at faithful simulation of lin-guistic performance should make explicit use of thefactor of linguistic normativity, this being, at least inprospect~ a building block for "self-tuning" functionsas an analogue for human learning capabilities.An approach best suited for effectuating theseprinciples eeirm to be that of relying on a lexicon-oriented lingware framework of a special kind.Within this framework, eTttrles of a uIfiform struc-ture may be provided, besides lexlcal units, also formorphological categories, fanctlon elements (inchd-lug punctuation), and all kinds of grammatical fea-tures, while syntagmatics of all levels may be pre-sented in terms of valencies of those levels, assignedto the corresponding lexical or grasmn.atlca\] units intheir entries.The JaFtAP experimental system is meaatt o in-corporate this approach.In ~cordance with the transfer scheme of transla-tion, the system is made up of three major com-ponents: the Japanese analysis component, theJapanesc-Rl~ssian transfer component, and the Rus-sian synthesis (generation) component.
It is imple-mented on IBM PC, MS DOS, its programming toolsbeing Arity Prolog for analysis and traamfer~ andTurbo Pascal for synthesis.2 The current version of theJaRAP systemAt present, the JaRAP system does not go far beyondthe i~fitial exico-morphological level of text process-ing (though some provision has already been madefor further stages of its development - see See.3).The analysis component of the system performsso far three main groups of operations: segmen-tation of the input Japanese texts into graphico-morphological (CAM-) elements (stems aJtd suffixesof Japanese words); processing s\] tranMationally id-iomatic (TI-) csm6inatisns of GM-elements; andlezieo-rnsrpholofical (LM-) analy~i.?
of the resultingsequence of (\]M-elements aatd the_Jr TLeomblnations.Segmentat ion is accomplished in two steps.First, the input text (= the input sequence of k~naand kanjl kodes) is broken up into fragments by con-teztual delimiters eertMn to denote word or morphboundaries (e.g., punctuation marks, the occurrenceof a k~tat~na symbol after a hlragana one or viceverB% etc,).
Then the fragmgnts obtained are seg-mented into GM-elements by mea~ts of dictionary1/2search.
The resulting GM-elements are representedby the reference numbers loc~tlng their dictionaryentries in the database used.
For segmentatimtallyambiguous fragments, all possible segmentations areformed.
If dictionary search is unsuccessful, the pro-gram draws oa ant auxiliary index of separate graphicsymbols, so that "unknown" words can still be pro-cessed (nard if they axe composed of "kaatjl, be evenprovided later on with a traatslatlon of sorts).The processing of TI combinations of GM-dements is partly necessitated by the fact that frag-ment boundaa'ies may sometimes epszate the com-ponents of a. eornpottnd word~ llkeso that these compoitents have then to be joined to-gether by a special procedure.
The saane procedure isused to locate multl-word comblaatloits similar to tin-gle GM-elements in that they have idioms.tic trans-latlons ~nd do not allow of variations in their htter-nal structure (this is often he case with terminologi-cal expressions).
TI-combint~tlons axe searched for assequences of reference numbers identifying the GM-elements they ~e composed of.
When.
found, theyare replaced each by a single reference number - thu.tof the entry for the TI-combinatlon as a whole, ~.ndare subsequently treated in the sumac way as individ-ual GM-elements (with some reservations mentionedin See.3).LM-analys ls  of a sequence of GM-elements ex-amines, for eazh of them, all of its alterna.tive l xico-morphological interpretations, or LM-elements con-tanned in its entry, with the aim of integnging theLM-elements corresponding to adjacent GM-elementsinto accepta.ble morphologtlcsl (M-) representationsof Japnmese word-forms.
The acceptzdfillty of theseis established by checldng each M-representa-tion, assomt as it is formed, for the co-occurrmtce restrk:-tions its elements may impose on eax:h other t~ndoft the elements of its immediate oittextual neigh-bours.
Tlfis also serves for disaznbiguation, as all theLM-elements that cannot be used to form a.n accept-able M-represent~rtion f a word-form in the givensequence of GM-elements, are filtered out.To optimize processing where aiterna.tive pa.ths ofanalysis are concerited, all analysis procedure, a.reorga.nlzed so  as to lhnit sep~r~tte processing of suchalternatives only to the subpatht; responsible for theditferences between them.
If some subp,~th is thesame in two or more of the alternative axtalyses, it i~processed just once, and the result is used for all thecorresponding Mteraatives.The bulk of the morpho log lea l  deser lpt lon sedin LM-analysis is of a valeney-~ased type (an excep-tioa being the morphonologica\] - or, r~ther~ morpho-graphical - alternations: t.he 10 metarnles represent-ing such altentations are incorpor~Lted in the segmen-tation procedure).
The morphological valencies aremostly assigned to suffixes, while stems (verbal or axLjecfival) ~t  as fillers.
The co-occurrence r strictionsimposed by the eh'.ments of ~ word-forra on those ofits adjax:ent word-forms are described in much.
thesame way (the only difference bei\]tg that irt this ca~ethe data.
to be checked is assigned to stems at least~L8 often as to sufi'ixes).
This helps to mt~ke word-bonnda.ries tra-nspa.rent, if necessa-ry, to morpholog-ical valencies, so that the borderline between mor-phology a.nd syntax loses something of its tradltlona\]r~ghtity.Transfer  operatioss s.t I, he lexico-morphologlcallevel ~tre limited ~Lt present o those of repbLcing tit<.

Sometimes this in-volves skipping a. uumber of intermediate lements,such as a.uxilia.rles, brackets, etc.Besides lexieo-morphological transfer, we ha.reby now implemented some very simple synts.cfieala.n~ysis-and-trv.nsfer opers.tions based on the mostgeneral correspondences betwemt Japanese and Run-sian structura.l and word-order information.

To speed up (lle-113tionary search~ the database is provided with ~n in-dex organized as a superposition of b~lanced trees.Ewch entry (presented in the database by ~ Pro-log term) constitutes a list of entry zones confinede~ch to one type of linguistic information.
A sep-axate zone (identified by the corresponding label)is used to specify, e.g., the graphical representationof the GM-element described, its structural (lexico-morphological) representation; the llst of its gram-matical maxkers; each type of restrictions imposedon the elements filling its morphological w, deneles,etc.
The overall set of entry zones is the same for alltypes of entries, though e~ch entry cont~ns only thezones relevant o the element described.At present, the d~tabase includes over two thou-sand entries.Special emphasis has been placed upon providingthe system with e~cient means of updating linguis-tic information.
The environment built for this pur-pose is called VOCOPS ("VOCabulary updating OP-tionS").The VOCOPS environment allows the user toadd, delete or replace all types of dlction~ry entriesor zones within them in a highly interactive mode.VOCOPS checks the updating information for its for-real accuracy and for its compatibility with the in-formation already contained in the current databa.se.It then proceeds to waxn the user of those con-sequence~ of lds updating operations which other-wise might have been overlooked, and to indicatethe in~cur~ies or inconsistencies detected.
If pos-sible, it also suggests the likely ways of their cor-rection.
Among other things, VOCOPS keeps watchon the correspondence b tween the entries for indi-vidual GM- (and LM-) elements ~d those for theirTI-combinatlons.
E.g., if the user wishes to deletea GM-element which forms pazt of some of the TI-combinations present in the database, VOCOPS liststhese with a warning that they will also be deleted.The Russian synthesis component is co~l-strutted as an independent subsystem, cornplete witha database of its own.
Its functions include both mor-phological generation and some tmpecta of syntacticprocessing.
Here we will not discuss it an any length,because there is ~ sepaxate paper devoted entirely tothis component (Kanovich,ShaJyapintr,199.1).3 Development  work underwayImplementing the most basic (however simple) of thelinguistic functions needed in translatior h the currentversion of the Jal'tAP system constitutes the neces-sary foundation for further developments.
Both itsdatabase and its programming software are struc-tured to a~cept any new components (new zones of)4the dictionary entries, new progra.ms, tetc) withoutimpairing ~.hose ~Iready functioning..'\]:he VOCOPSupdating subsystem is also general enough to be e~-ily tuned up to new types of linguistic d~t~ as soonas they are included in the system.Moreover, even in its present form, the JM~.AP sys-tem comprises ome specific features mea~tt for moreadwnced lingulstic processing.Thus, aznong the grammatical markers assigned tothe Japanese LM-elements in the current databaseaxe u number of those to be used in syntactical nal-ysis.Entries for TI-comblnations of GM-elements in-clude specification of their syntactically ~d seman-tically dominant components, for use in processingpaxallel constructions and a~taphor~.The list of the Russian equivalents for an LM-element includes, wherever desirable, different partsof speech, the choice between them to be effected bythe syntactical tra~tsfer.The synthesis component is designed to ~ceptsyntactic',dly weighted representations of Russianword-forms, etc,Now that we have built the ba.qic groundwork,labor-consuming as it is, we are taking up these, moreambitious tasks.As the Japanese-Russlan pa~r of languages i vir-tually unexplored in its machine-tra~tslation perspec-tive, our immediate off'errs are being focussed on de-termining the reasonable minimum of grazmnaticalknowledge of Japanese necessary for obtaining intel-ligible Russian output for unadapted (us-pro-edited)Japanese input.References\[1\] Kanovich, M.I., Sha\]ys.pina, Z.M.
