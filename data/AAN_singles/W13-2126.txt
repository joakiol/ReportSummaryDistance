Although previous work has ad-dressed linguistic variations at differentlevels of language, paraphrasing in Turk-ish has not been yet thoroughly studied.This paper presents the first study towardsTurkish paraphrase alignment.
We per-form an analysis of different types of para-phrases on a modest Turkish paraphrasecorpus and present preliminary results onthat analysis from different standpoints.We also explore the impact of human in-terpretation of paraphrasing on the align-ment of paraphrase sentence pairs.1 IntroductionParaphrases are alternative linguistic expressionsthat convey the same content.
Natural languagesallow linguistic variations at different levels (e.g.,lexical and phrasal) and a change at a level of lan-guage may trigger other changes at different lev-els.
Paraphrasing has attracted a growing inter-est from the research community in a broad rangeof tasks such as language generation (Power andScott, 2005), machine translation (Callison-Burchet al 2006), and question answering (Franceet al 2003).
Moreover, research on acquisi-tion (Max et al 2012), generation (Zhao et al2010), and recognition (Qiu et al 2006) of para-phrases has been on the rise for the last decade.Paraphrasing is also an increasingly studied prob-lem by the generation community.
One particulartext-to-text generation problem being addressed isthe generation of sentence-level paraphrases byconverting a sentence into a new one with approx-imately the same meaning (Wubben et al 2010).One aspect of paraphrasing is the specifica-tion of paraphrase types via a typology.
Buildingparaphrase typologies from different perspectives(e.g., linguistics analysis and discourse analysis)has been an active research area for a number ofyears now (Vila et al 2011).
In particular, lin-guistic grounds govern the typologies built by lan-guage processing systems (Kozlowski et al 2003)which are often very generic or system specific.Research on paraphrase alignment focuses onidentifying links between semantically relatedword strings.
Such monolingual alignments canbe later used as training data for several nat-ural language processing approaches (e.g., tex-tual entailment and multidocument summariza-tion) (Thadani et al 2012).
Although a wealthamount of research has studied various problemsrelated to Turkish, we here focus on a problemwhich has not been studied earlier.
We present ourinitial explorations on Turkish paraphrase align-ment by considering how alignment is affected byhuman interpretation of paraphrasing.
We con-ducted a study on a modest corpus from four dif-ferent sources to investigate answers to the follow-ing questions: i) What are the types of paraphrasesthat can be observed at different levels of Turk-ish?
ii) Do humans agree on the existence of para-phrasing between Turkish paraphrase sentences?iii) How does human interpretation of paraphras-ing affect the alignment of paraphrase sentences?Our study is unique in that it presents a generictypology of paraphrase types found in our Turkishparaphrase corpus and discusses the agreement ofhuman annotators on the identification and clas-sification of observed correspondences betweenparaphrases.
This study also presents our aggre-gated observations on the relation between inter-pretation and alignment of paraphrase casts.188Figure 1: Sentence similarityscores of the corpus.Literary News Subtitles ParallelText Articles Corpus# Tokens 1879 3379 1632 1581# Unique Tokens 811 1473 824 609# Shared Tokens 519 1125 402 354Lexical Overlap 72.5 82.9 63.2 62.7Lexical Overlap 68.4 67.2 48.6 45(lem.

We mea-sured sentence similarities of all paraphrase pairsfrom each domain via three measures typicallyused in statistical machine translation evaluations:TER (Matthew Snover, 2006), BLEU (Papineniet al 2002), and METEOR (Lavie and Agar-wal, 2007).
As shown in Figure 1, the order-ing of domains with respect to all metrics are thesame where the pairs from the news domain andthose from the parallel corpus are the most and theleast similar pairs respectively.
Since there are di-vergences across different domains, we randomlydrew from each domain an equal number of sen-tences (i.e., 100 paraphrase pairs1).
Some charac-teristic features of the paraphrase pairs selected forthis study are shown in Table 1.3 Paraphrase TypologyTo our best knowledge, a Turkish paraphrasetypology that we can apply to this study doesnot yet exist in the literature.
On the other hand,building a comprehensive typology is not one ofour objectives.
There are a number of availabletypologies built for English (Dras, 1999; Vilaet al 2011).
Since our focus in this work is oncharacterizing paraphrasing at different levels oflanguage, we greatly drew from the linguistically-motivated typology by Vila et al(2011) whilebuilding our generic typology.
We examined theselected 400 paraphrase pairs and constructed atypology that covers all paraphrases occurringwithin these pairs.
Our typology covers threelevels of language and consists of four classes.1The number of paraphrase pairs in the subtitle domainlimits the study to 100 pairs from each domain.The lexical class covers all changes that arisefrom exchanging words within a phrase withother words and includes four subclasses (i.e.,substitution, substitution with opposite polarity,deletion, and pronominalization)2 :(1) ?Su bize takip edebileceg?imiz hic?bir1 iz1b?rakm?yor1.?
(Water leaves1 no1 trace1 that wecan follow.
)(2) ?Su olay?n takip edilebilecek bu?tu?n1 izlerini1yok1 ediyor1.?
(The water destroys1 all1 traces1of the event that can be followed.
)The morphological class covers inflectionaland derivational changes within words and in-cludes two subclasses (i.e., inflectional changesand derivational changes):(1) ?Bo?yle bir ilac?
almaktansa hasta1 kalmak1iyidir.?
(Staying1 sick1 is better than taking such adrug.
)(2) ?Hasta1 kal?r?m1 da yine de bu ilac?
ic?mem.?
(I1stay1 sick1 still I don?t take this drug.
)The phrasal class includes changes that arisefrom exchanging fragments with same meaning:1) ?Bunlar?
biliyorum fakat emri ben1vermedim1.?
(I know all that, but I1 did1not1 give1 the order.
)(2) ?Bunlar?
biliyorum ama, emri veren1 ben1deg?ilim1.?
(I know all that, but I?m1 not1 the1one1 who1 gave1 the order.
)The other class is for all other changes thatimply different lexicalizations for the samecontextual meaning:(1) ?Savas?
c?
?k?nca pek c?ok c?ingene eskilerdekigibi ko?tu?1 kis?iler1 oldular1.?
(When war brokeout, many gypsies became1 just1 as bad1 people1as those of the past.
)(2) ?Savas?ta birc?ok c?ingene eskiden oldug?u gibiyine c?ok1 ko?tu?lu?k1 yapt?lar1.?
(Many gypsies did1much1 evil1 in the war again as in the past.
)2Each word in a paraphrase cast receives the same sub-script.189Although these classes are language indepen-dent, they include several Turkish specific as-pects such as morphophonemic processes.
For in-stance, Turkish word changes due to vowel har-mony, vowel drops, and consonant drops/changesare all covered by the morphological class.4 Paraphrase AlignmentWhile manually aligning the paraphrase sentencepairs, our goal was to jointly identify the para-phrase casts (i.e., the substitutable word strings)and specify the types correspondences betweenthem.
We asked three native speakers to align theselected paraphrase sentences by aligning wordstrings3 as much as possible and marking thestrength of observed correspondences as either?certain?
(the correspondences that hold in anycontext) or ?possible?
(the correspondences thatare context-specific).
The annotators were alsotold to assign each identified correspondence be-tween paraphrase casts to one of the classes in ourtypology.
In cases where the same word stringswere aligned, the correspondence was not classi-fied with a class from the typology.
Before align-ing the corpus, the annotators were trained on adifferent set of paraphrases using an annotationguideline.
Table 2 reports some statistics of thealignment process.
The column labelled as ?Com-mon?
represents the alignments common to all an-notators.
The rows labelled as ?C?, ?P?, and ?U?represent the number of certain and possible align-ments, and the number of unaligned words respec-tively4.
It is noteworthy that the percentage ofcommon certain alignments is significantly higherthan the percentage of common possible align-ments in all domains.5 Corpus Study FindingsIn this study, we aim to explore whether hu-mans agree on the existence (i.e., identifying twoword strings as paraphrases) and type of para-phrasing between Turkish paraphrase sentences.We are also interested in how the alignment ofparaphrase casts is affected from human inter-pretation of paraphrasing between Turkish para-3A word string consists of one or more words which maynot be contiguous.

Please note that the alignmentof paraphrase casts consequently affects the sen-tence alignment of paraphrase sentence pairs.Our analysis started with examining how oftenour annotators agreed on identifying paraphrasingbetween two word strings.
The agreement scoresin Table 3 show that the annotators (pairwise) hada reasonable level of agreement in all domains.
Inmajority of these cases, the annotators also agreedon the strength of the correspondence (i.e., bothannotators either classified the correspondence as?Certain-Certain?
or ?Possible-Possible?

We thus exploredwhether the annotators similarly classified theword strings that they identified as paraphrases.
Inall domains, the agreement scores between the an-notators (given in Table 4) are dramatically lowerthan the scores in Table 3.
It is particularlynoteworthy that the smallest drop is observed inthe parallel corpus domain (the domain that con-tains the least similar sentences).
In cases wherethe annotators (pairwise) classified the same wordstrings with the same paraphrase class, they hada high agreement (between 78% and 91%) on thestrength of the correspondence in all domains.
Wealso computed the inter-annotator agreement viaKappa (Cohen, 1960).

Notably, the identified paraphraseclasses between word strings appear to diverge inseveral respects.
We are currently exploring thereason behind this poor annotator agreement onparaphrase classes.
One possible reason might bedifferent understanding of the typology.As a second step, we explored the impact ofdifferent interpretations of paraphrasing betweensentence pairs on the alignment of these sen-tences.
We analyzed the alignment differences ofsentences and classified them into four classes:- Different Classification: Although bothannotators identify the same correspondencebetween two word strings, they classify thatcorrespondence differently.- Missing Alignment: One annotator identifies analignment between two word strings but the otherannotator does not identify a correspondencebetween these word strings.- Missing Word: The annotators identify acorrespondence of the same paraphrase classbetween two word strings which differ only in oneword.- Different Grouping: Two word strings areidentified as having a single correspondenceby one annotator whereas a number of disjointcorrespondences between these word strings areidentified by the other annotator.All these differences except those classified as?different classification?
result in different align-ments between word strings.
Such different align-ments of paraphrase casts then change the align-ment of paraphrase sentences.6 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we present our initial explorationson Turkish paraphrase alignment by exploiting amodest corpus.
We built a generic and linguisti-cally grounded Turkish paraphrase typology thatcovers the types of paraphrases observed in thecorpus.
In the study, the paraphrases identifiedby human annotators were aligned and annotatedwith paraphrase classes from the typology.
Theagreement of the annotators with respect to the ex-istence and alignment of paraphrases as well asthe associated paraphrase classes were reported.The study showed that the way how humans in-terpret paraphrasing between Turkish paraphrasesentences has an impact on how they align thesesentences.We have two main directions for future re-search: i) conducting a larger corpus study fordrawing generalizations about Turkish paraphras-ing and enhancing the typology if necessary, andii) building Turkish paraphrase applications (e.g.,automatic paraphrase acquisition) in correlationwith the collected insights.
We believe that thecurrent findings for Turkish paraphrase alignmentand our corpus enriched with paraphrase typesenable future research on paraphrase phenomenain different fields such as language generation,textual entailment, summarization, and machinetranslation to be empirically assessed.191ReferencesChris Callison-Burch, Philipp Koehn, and Miles Os-borne.
