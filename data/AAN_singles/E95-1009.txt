Computational dialectology in Irish GaelicBrett Kessler*Department of LinguisticsStanford UniversityStanford CA 94305-2150 USAkessler@csli.stanford.eduAbst rac tDialect groupings can be discovered ob-jectively and automatically by clusteranalysis of phonetic transcriptions suchas those found in a linguistic atlas.
Thefirst step in the analysis, the computa-tion of linguistic distance.between achpair of sites, can be computed as Leven-shtein distance between phonetic strings.This correlates closely with the muchmore laborious technique of determiningand counting isoglosses, and is more ac-curate than the more familiar metric ofcomputing Hamming distance based onwhether vocabulary entries match.
Inthe actual clustering step, traditional ag-glomerative clustering works better thaxlthe top-down technique of partitioningaround medoids.
When agglomerativeclustering of phonetic string comparisondistances is applied to Gaelic, reasonabledialect boundaries are obtained, corre-sponding to national and (within Ire-land) provincial boundaries.1 Introduct ionDefining dialects is one of the first tasks that lin-guists need to pursue when approaching a lan-guage.
Knowing the dialect areas helps one allo-cate resources in language research and has impli-cations for language learners, publishers, broad-casters, educators, and language planners.
Un-fortunately, dialect definition can be a time-consuming and ill-defined process.
The traditionalapproach as been to plot isoglosses, delineatingregions where the same word is used for the sameconcept, or perhaps the same pronunciation forthe same phoneme.
But isoglosses are frustrat-ing.
The first problem, as Gaston Paris noted(apud Durand, 1889:49), is that isoglosses rarelycoincide.
At best, isoglosses for different featuresapproach each other, forming vague bundles; at*I thank Martin Kay, Paul Kiparsky, Tom Wasow,and a reviewer for helpful comments.worst, isoglosses may cut across each other, de-scribing completely contradictory binary divisionsof the dialect area.
That is, language may vary ge-ographically in many dimensions, but the require-ments we usually impose require that a specificsite be placed in a unique dialect.
Traditional di-alectological methodology gives little guidance asto how to perform such reduction to one dimen-sion.A second problem is that many isoglosses do notneatly bisect the language area.
Often variantsdo not neatly line up on two sides of a line, butare intermixed haphazardly.
More importantly,for some sites information may be lacking, or thequestion is simply not applicable.
When compar-ing how various sites pronounce the first conso-nant of a particular word, it is meaningless to askthat question if the site does not use that word.
Sothe isogloss is incomplete and cannot be meaning-fully compared with isoglosses based on differentsets of sites.The third problem is that most languages havedialect continua, such that the speech of one com-munity differs little from the speech of its neigh-bouts.
Even though the cumulative ffects of suchdifferences may be great when one considers theends of the continua (such as southern Italian ver-sus northern French), still it seems arbitrary todraw major dialect boundaries between two vil-lages with very similar speech patterns.
Such co-nundrums led Paris and others to conclude thatthe dialect boundary, and therefore the very no-tion of dialect, is an ill-defined concept.More recently, the field of dialectometry, as in-troduced by S~guy (1971, 1973), has addressedthese issues by developing several techniques forsummarizing and presenting variation along mul-tiple dimensions.
They replace isoglosses with adistance matrix, which compares each site directlywith all other sites, ultimately yielding a singlefigure that measures the linguistic distances be-tween each pair of sites.
There is however no firmagreement on just how to compute the distancematrices.
Sfiguy's earliest work (1971) was basedon lexical correspondences: ites differed in theextent to which they used different words for the60same concept.
S~guy (1973), Philps (1987), andDurand (1989) use some combination of lexical,phonological, and morphological data.
Babitch(1988) described the dialectal distances in Aca-dian villages by the degree to which their fishingterminology varied.
Babitch and Lebrun (1989)did a similar analysis based on the varying pro-nunciation o f / r / .
Elsie (1986) grouped the Gaelicdialects on the basis of whether the vocabularymatched.
Ebobisse (1989) grouped the Sawabantulanguages of Cameroon by whether phonologi-cal correspondences in matching vocabulary itemswere complete, partial, or lacking.
There seems tobe a certain bias in favour of working with lexicalcorrespondences, which is understandable, sincedeciding whether two sites use the same word forthe same concept is perhaps one of the easiest lin-guistic judgements to make.
The need to figureout such systems as the comparative phonology ofvarious linguistic sites can be very time-consumingand fraught with arbitrary choices.Not all dialectometrists agree on the wisdom ofdelineating dialect areas.
Sdguy (1973:18) insistedthat the concept of dialect boundaries was mean-ingless, and his emphasis on the gradience of lan-guage similarity has been widely maintained.
Bu'tthose who do look for firna dialect affiliations (suchas Babitch and Ebobisse) use bottom-up agglom-erative techniques.
The two linguistically closestsites are grouped into one dialect, and thence-forth treated as a unit.
The process continuesrecursively until all sites are grouped into one su-perdialect embracing the entire language area un-der consideration.
This yields a binary tree.
ButKaufman and Rousseeuw (1990:44) suggest thatwhen the emphasis in a clustering problem is onthe top-level clusters--here, finding the two maindialects--then such bottom-up methods, whichcan potentially introduce error at each of severalsteps, are less reliable than top-down partitioningmethods.
Perhaps past researchers have used in-ferior bottom-up techniques imply because thenecessary algorithms are computationally moretractable.
Comparing all possible pairs of sites is aO(N 2) problem, 1whereas considering all possibletwo-way partitions of tile dialect area is 0(2 N).The current state of dialectometry thus presentstwo main questions which constitute the method-ological focus of this paper.
The first deals withdistance matrices.
Is there a way to build ac-curate distance matrices that minimize editorialdecisions without discarding relevant data?
Myresearch suggests that this may be done by us-ing string distances computed directly on pho-netic transcriptions, and that this is better thanrestricting the study to lexical comparisons.
Thesecond deals with clustering.
Do bottom-up or1The overall algorithm is O(N 3) since for each ue~vgroup one must compute the distances between it andeach of the other sites or groups.top-down techniques work best?
My conclusionis that the traditional bottom-up technique worksbetter than a typical top-down method.
Theseconclusions are based partly on an analysis ofthe mathematical properties of the clusters them-selves, partly on how well they correlate withanalyses based on more traditional isogloss tech-niques, and partly on how well they compare withpreviously-published descriptions of dialects in aspecific language, Irish Gaelic.At one time the Gaelic languag~ group was spo-ken throughout Ireland, from where it spread tothe Isle of Man and to much of Scotland.
Cur-rently fully native use of Gaelic is limited to a fewdiscontiguous areas in the westernmost reaches ofIreland and Scotland.
In the case of Ireland, ev-eryone agrees that Gaelic is nowadays found inthree main dialects: that of Ulster, that of Con-nacht, and that of Munster (0 Siadhail, 1989).But several questions are raised that are less eas-ily answered.
Do the three provinces eparate outso neatly for intrinsic linguistic reasons, or simplybecause their speakers have become so widely sep-arated from each other geographically as speakersin intervening areas have adopted English?
Doesthe language of Connacht naturally group withthat of Ulster or with that of Munster?
And look-ing beyond Ireland, many have commented thatthe language of Ulster in general is similar to thatof Scotland.
Are Irish, Manx, and Scottish Gaelicconsidered three separate languages for intrinsiclinguistic reasons, or because they are spoken indifferent countries?
To a large extent, dialectolo-gists have found these questions difficult to an-swer because they accepted Paris's conundrum.For 6 Siadhail, the ultimate scientific justifica-tion ill adopting the three-dialect account is thefact that the Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking territory)is so fragmented nowadays that it no longer formsa continuum.
O Cuiv (1951:4-49) felt that therecan be no dialect boundaries because transitionsare gradual.
Elsie (1986:240) considers a dialect obe an area where all communities are linguisticallymore similar to each other than any community isto any site outside the dialect.
Such notions pro-vide a very firm, absolute notion of dialecthood:a set of communities either constitutes a dialectarea, or it does not.
But as the dialectometristshave shown, other notions of clustering are equallyscientific and may more accurately correspond tointuitive notions of what it means to be a dialect.2 DataThe data for nay study were taken from Wagner1958.
Wagner administered a questionnaire to na-tive speakers of Irish Gaelic in 86 sites.
2 Most ofthe informants were over seventy years old and2The atlas also maps for Kilkenny some informa-tion gathered from another source.61had not spoken Irish since their youth, The at-las is therefore an approximate reconstruction ofthe linguistic landscape of the turn of the century,when the Gaeltacht was more continuous.
Wag-ner also presents material from the Isle of Man andseven sites in Scotland.
The mapped entries arepresented in a very narrow phonetic transcriptionbased on the International Phonetic Alphabet.Volume 1 of Wagner 1958 consists of 300 maps,plotting about 370 concepts.
I used the first 51concepts, or about 4500 different string tokens, aspart of an ongoing project to enter all of the atlasinto machine readable format.
These 51 conceptswere represented by 312 different Gaelic words orphrases, whose stems derived from 171 differentetymons.3 Methodology and results3.1 D is tance  matr i cesTo form a baseline for comparison, I analysed thedistribution of each of the 51 plotted concepts,finding a total of 3,337 features by which two ormore sites differed.
For example, for the concept'sell', I identified two sets, one using the wordd(ol (most sites in Ireland), and one using theword creic (Rathlin Island, the Isle of Man, andScotland).
The dialects partitioned in a differentway according to how much stress they placed onthe verb relative to the pronoun in 'I sold' (evenstress in Dunlewy and four of the Scottish sites,else extra stress on the verb).
Not all partitionscovered the entire map.
In this example, onlysites that used the word d(ol were compared onthe basis of whether a schwa developed in the se-quence \[i:l\].
In some cases the divisions were morethan two-way: for example, Wagner distinguisheswhether the final consonant in creic is unpalatal-ized, palatalized, or slightly palatalized.
Distancebetween sites was determined by counting 0 when-ever two sites were in the same set and 1 whenevertwo sites were in contrasting sets, then taking themean.
This baseline approach corresponds for-mally to determining distance by the number ofisoglosses that separate sites, which is in principlethe traditional technique.This baseline was compared to several other ap-proaches.
The etymon identity metric averagedthe number of times the sites agreed in usingwords whose stem had the same ultimate deriva-tion.
For example, the dialects differed as towhether they used some form of bull- or damh-for the word 'bullock'.
Etymon identity is oneof the more common approaches in dialectom-etry; Elsie for example used it in his study ofthe Gaelic dialects (1986).
Closely related is theidea of word identity, where the words are notcounted the same unless all of their morphemesagree.
In this analysis, sites that used some formof the word bulldn, with the suffix -dn, were dis-tinguished from those using the suffix -6g.Another set of approaches for computing dis-tance was based on the phonetics.
This com-puted the Levenshtein distance between phoneticstrings.
The Levenshtein distance is the cost ofthe least expensive set of insertions, deletions, orsubstitutions that would be needed to transformone string into the other (Sankoff and Kruskal,1983).
The simplest technique used was phonestring comparison.
In this approach, all opera-tions cost 1 unit.
Thus in comparing the forms\[AL:i\] and \[aLi\] for eallaigh 'cattle', the (minimal)distance was 2, for the substitutions \[a\]/\[A\] and\[L:\]/\[L\].
(For this measure, diacritics such as thelength mark ':' were counted as part of the letter,and different diacritics were adjudged to make fordifferent letters.)
A pair of unrelated words like\[AL:i\] and \[khruh\] (for crodh, another word for 'cat-tie') would get a much larger score, 5.In the above technique, very small phoneticdifferences, such as that between a moderatelypalatalized and a very palatalized \[t\], count thesame as major differences, such as that betweena \[t\] and an \[e\].
It would seem to be more ac-curate to assign a greater distance to substitu-t.ions involving greater phonetic distinctions.
Un-fortunately I know of no comprehensive study onthe differences between phones, at least not forall 277 contrasts made by Wagner.
Instead I dis-tinguished them on the basis of twelve phoneticfeatures that systematically account for all of thedistinctions in Wagner's inventory: nasality, stric-ture, laterality, articulator, glottis, place, palatal-ization, rounding, length, height, strength, andsyllabicity.
The features were given discrete ordi-nal values caled between 0 and 1, the exact valuesbeing arbitrary.
For example, place took on thevalues glottal=O, uvular=0.1, postvelar=0.2, ve-lar=0.3, prevelar=O.~, palatal=0.5, alveolar=0.7,dental=0.8, and labial=l.
The distance betweenany two phones was judged to be the differencebetween the feature values, averaged across alltwelve features.
These distances were used insteadof uniform 1-unit costs in computing Levenshteindistance.
The resulting metric was called featurestring comparison.It could be argued that it is meaningless to com-pare the phonetics of different words, as in the caseof eallaigh vs. crodh mentioned above.
Thereforethe feature string comparison was also computedonly for pairs of citations that used the same word,so that \[AL:i\] vs. \[aLi\] would be compared, but\[AL:i\] vs. \[khruh\] would be ignored.
The differ-ent approaches are called all-word vs. same-wordfeature string comparisons.All of these distance matrices were comparedwith the isogloss matrix, to see which of themgives results closest to that base method.
I usedtwo different methods of comparison, Pearson's pcomputed between all corresponding cells in the62Table 1: Correlation of distance matrices to theisogloss distance matrixp K~Phone string comparison .95 .76Feature string comparison- -  Ml-word .92 .70- -  same-word .91 .69Etymon identity .85 .61Word identity .84 .63two matrices, andKc = Average(sign((Xi j  - Xik)(Yij - Yik))which is a derivative of Kendall's r that Dietz(1983) empirically found particularly accurate asa test statistic for comparing distance matrices, aTable 1 shows that the two measures give paral-lel results.
More importantly, it shows that theapproaches based on string comparisons of thephonetic transcriptions correlate more highly withthe isogloss approach than do the word or etymonidentity measures.
Furthermore, comparing wholephone letters works better than the more sophi.s-ticated technique of comparing features, and re-stricting comparison to pairs based on the samewords does not make the latter any better.Of course, I do not expect that this techniqueusing flat 1-unit costs will prove superior to allmethods that are more sensitive to phonetic de-tails.
Feature comparison may work better if fea-tures were weighted ifferentially, or if the numericvalues they assume were assigned less arbitrarily,or if the Manhattan-style distance computationwere replaced by some formula that did not as-sume that the features are independent of eachother.
An ideal comparison would be based ondata telling how likely it is for the one phone toturn into the other in the course of normal lan-guage change.
In the method described here, Is\]is adjudged closer to \[g\] than to \[h\].
But \[s\] of-ten changes into \[hi in the world's languages, andso the pair should have a small distance; whereasthe change of \[s\] to \[g\] has never occurred to myknowledge, and so should have a very large dis-tance.
The unfortunate fact that such ideal dataare lacking is compensated for by the fact that theinexpensive phone-string comparison employed inthis study performs quite well.3.2 C lus ter ing  techn iquesThe traditional agglomerative t chnique for clus-tering has been described above.
There is some3That is, for each site i, one considers all otherpairs of sites, j and k, and asks whether the linguisticdifference between i and j is greater or less than thatbetween i and k. One counts 1 if the answer is thesame for both distance matrices, -1 if it is different.//'c is the average of these numbers.variation in how the distance between two clus-ters is measured.
For this study I used the averagedistance between all pairs of elements that are indifferent clusters.
I compared agglomeration to atop-down method that Kaufman and Rousseeuw(1990) call partitioning around medoids.
Thismodel reduces the 0(2 Jr) intractability of top-down approaches discussed above by dramaticallyreducing the number of binary partitions that areconsidered.
Here one seeks to divide the sites intotwo groups by finding the two representative sites(the medoids) around which all the other sitescluster in such a way as to give the least averagedistance between the sites and their representa-tives.
This is therefore a O(N 3) algorithm, com-parable in efficiency to agglomeration.
The pro-cess was repeated recursively on each dialect.One way of measuring how well a binary clus-tering technique works for dialect grouping is tocompare for each site i its average dissimilarityfrom the other sites in the same dialect, a(i), withits average dissimilarity from the sites in the otherdialect, b(i).
Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990:83-86) define the statistic s(i) to be 1 - a(i)/b(i) ifa(i) is less than b(i), otherwise b(i)/a(i) - 1.
Thestatistic thus ranges from 1 (perfect fit) to -1  (sitei would perfectly fit in the other group).
Plottingthis statistic gives a silhouelte by which the eyecall judge how well classified each site is.
Aver-aging this statistic across all sites gives an idea ofhow felicitous the overall clustering is, ~.Figures 1-2 present he silhouette for clusteringthe isogloss distance matrix by partitioning.
Thisanalysis produces a large dialect which groups to-gether the sites in Munster, Scotland, the Isle ofMan, and almost all sites in Connacht, as wellas Rathlin Island in Ulster; and another whichgroups together all the other sites in Ulster, aswell as County Cavan in Connacht.
Although theUlster group is fairly tight, with an g of 0.41, theother group has a more anemic ~ of 0.25, withthe sites outside of Munster and Southern Con-nacht being indifferently classified.
The weightedfor both groups comes out at 0.29.
By com-parison, Figures 3-4 show what happens whenthe traditional agglomerative t chnique is used.The dialects of Scotland and the Isle of Manform a cluster with a great deal of internal di-versity ($ = 0.12), and all the sites in Irelandform another cluster averaging ~= 0.37, with onlyRathlin Island being indifferently classified.
Theweighted average is 0.35, which is superior to thatof the partitioning technique.The same comparative results obtain for almostall of the distance measuring techniques.
Table 2shows that the ~ for the first binary split is usuallyappreciably higher for agglomeration than it is forpartitioning.
This result suggests not any inferi-ority of top-down techniques in general--applyingthe g statistic to all binary partitions would by63**** Kilkenny, Kilkenny, Leinster,  Ireland**** Lough Attorick,  Galway, Connacht,  Ireland*** Doolin, Clare, Munster ,  Ireland*** Fanore,  Clare, Munster ,  Ireland*** Clear Island, Cork, Munster ,  Ireland*** Skibbereen,  Cork, Munster ,  I reland*** Kinvra,  Galway, Connacht,  Ireland*** Coomhola,  Cork, Munster ,  Ireland*** Cloghane, Kerry, Munster ,  Ireland*** Ki lgarvan, Kerry, Munster ,  Ireland*** Watervi l le,  Kerry, Munster ,  Ireland*** Ki l lorgl in, Kerry, Munster ,  Ireland*** Glandore,  Cork, Munster ,  I reland*** Carraroe,  Galway, Connacht,  Ireland*** Dursey Sound, Cork, Munster ,  Ireland*** Careeny, Galway, Connacht,  Ireland*** BMlymacoda,  Cork, Munster ,  Ireland*** Newbridge,  Galway, Connacht, Ireland*** Ki lsheelan, Water iord,  Munster ,  Ireland*** Conakilty, Cork, Munster ,  I reland*** Craughwell, Galway, Connacht, Ireland-*** Coolea, Cork, Munster ,  Ireland*** Rosmuck, Galway, Connacht,  Ireland*** Glenflesk, Kerry, Munster ,  Ireland*** Mount Melleray, Waterford,  Munster ,  Ireland*** Cornamona,  Galway, Connacht,  Irel,~nd*** Dunquin,  Kerry, Munzter,  Ireland*** Tourmakeady,  Mayo, Connacht,  Ireland*** Ring, Waterford,  Munster ,  Ireland*** Laughanbeg,  Galway, Connacht,  Ireland*** Emlaghmore,  Galway, Connacht,  Ireland** Lauragh,  Kerry, Munster ,  Ireland** Ki lbaha,  Clare, Munster ,  Ireland** Moycullen, Galway, Connacht,  Ireland** Sliabh gCua,  Waterford,  Munster ,  Ireland** Ki lmovee, Mayo, Connacht,  Ireland** Goatenbr idge,  T ipperary ,  Munster ,  Ireland** Colmanstown,  Galway, Connacht,  Ireland** Inisheer, Galway, Connacht,  Ireland** Glentrasna,  Galway, Connacht,  Ireland** Let ter f rack,  Galway, Connacht,  Irela, nd** Angl iham, Galway, Connacht,  Ireland** Annaghdown,  Galway, Connacht,  Ireland** Lough NMooey, Galway, Connacht, I reland** Sonnagh, Galway, Connacht,  Ireland** C~.rna, Galway, Connacht,  Ireland** Louisburgh,  Mayo, Connacht,  Ireland** In ishmaan,  Galway, Connacht,  Ireland** Camderry ,  Galway, Connacht, Ireland** Ceathrt l  an TMrbh,  Roscommon, Connacht,  Ire.

Both group into one loosely-connected entity all the sites in Scotland, and intoanother all the sites in Ireland.
The isogloss ap-proach groups Manx as a cousin of the Scottishdialects, and the phonetic approach makes it acousin of the Irish dialects, but in both cases thes of Manx is very small (less than 0.06), making itessentially intermediate between the two groups.Thus the popular notion that Scottish, Irish andManx Gaelic are distinct entities is well supportedby the analyses.
Both analyses group Rathlin Is-land very weakly with the rest of Irish, but the sfor Rathlin is so low (less than 0.09) that its group-ing too is essentially arbitrary.
This aligns withthe fact that authorities disagree as to whether itis a dialect of Irish (as does Wagner) or of Scot-tish (O'Rahilly 1932:191).
Except for Rathlin Is-land, both methods group the Irish sites into onegroup containing all the sites in Ulster, and an-other, Southern, group, which itself breaks intoa group containing all the sites in Connacht andone containing all the sites in Munster.
4 Bothmethods agree on how the 87 sites are distributedamong these dialects.
This three-way division ac-cords with the universal perception that Ulster,Connacht and Munster form the three major di-alect groups.
The special status of Ulster con-tradicts the position of O'Rahilly (1932:18) thatConnacht groups with Ulster to form a Northerndialect over against Munster.
But it agrees withElsie's finding (1986:255) that that province is lex-icostatistically more remote from Connacht andMunster than those two are from each other.
Fur-thermore, Hindley reports (1990:63) that speakersof other dialects often switch off radio broadcastsin Ulster Irish, 'which is very distinctive'.Thus the classification of the major Gaelic di-alects gives the same general results by both dis-tance metrics, if one discounts Manx and RathlinIsland Gaelic, which are flagged as indifferent inboth schemes.
It is encouraging that the resultantdialect areas are continuous, align with traditionalprovincial boundaries, and agree with commonlyaccepted taxonomies.
However, dialect groupingsat narrower levels, such as the exact subgroupingof the major provincial dialects, are at this pointunstable.
This is no doubt to be explained by thefairly small number of mapped concepts on whichthe distance metrics are based (51).

Louth, groups with Ulster,and indeed the county used to be considered part ofthat province.5S~guy (1973) cites empirical research suggesting65differences get smaller, one expects that more datawill be required in order to elucidate them.4 Conc lus ionsThis experiment shows that an automatic proce-dure can reliably group a language into its di-Meet areas, starting from nothing more than pho-netic transcriptions as commonly found in linguis-tic surveys.
Accurate distance matrices, corre-sponding highly to those obtained by the tediousuncovering of thousands of isoglosses, can be ob-tained by averaging the Levenshtein distance be-tween phonetic strings, weighting equally all inser-tion, deletion, and substitution operations on theconstituent phones.
This turns out to be quitea bit more precise than the common techniqueof measuring distances by judging etymon iden-tity, and requires even less editorial work.
Thatphonetic comparison is more precise is not par-ticularly surprising, since etymon identity ignoresa wealth of phonetic, phonological, and morpho-logical data, whereas comparing phones has theside effect of also counting higher-level variation:if words differ in morphemes, their phonetic dif-ference is going to be high.
As for clustering thesites into dialect areas, the familiar bottom-up ag-glomeration method proves superior to top-downpartitioning around medoids.Of course simply knowing the dialect areas isnot the last word in dialectology.
There remainsuch essential problems as identifying the differ-ing linguistic structures that characterize the di-alects, and discovering their history.
But all ofthese tasks will be greatly facilitated by a quickand accurate grouping of the dialects.ReferencesBabitch, Rose Mary (1988).
