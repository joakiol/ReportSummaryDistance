High-tech language tools and resourcesfor Irish are being developed in a number of universities in Ireland and elsewhere, in language technolo-gy areas relating to search, parsing, proofing, speech, translation, etc.
(Judge at al., 2012).
This paperaims to highlight work done by researchers at Fiontar, Dublin City University (DCU), to make a numberof valuable Irish-language terminological, lexicographical, onomastic, and folkloristic data stocks morereadily accessible, usable, and manageable using web and database technologies.
Tools built with thesetechnologies have facilitated the re-organisation, distributed development, and more widespread dissem-ination of these data stocks, as well as the creation of new data stocks.
These language tools, which areon a par with tools that are available to users of well-resourced languages (take for example the onlineinterface of the multilingual terminology database of the European Union, IATE: http://iate.europa.eu/),are now enabling Irish language users, language professionals, and linguists operate in an environmentsimilar to that of their major language counterparts.
The public interfaces of all Irish-language tools andresources developed by Fiontar are made available at http://www.gaois.ie/.1 IntroductionAlthough Irish is a low-resourced language, the Irish Government?s 20 Year Strategy for the IrishLanguage, which prioritises the ?promotion and protection?
of the language (Government of Ireland,2010), has brought about investment in the creation of digital language tools and resources.
Linguisticresources, such as printed dictionaries, are now being made available electronically through retro-digitisation, or being created digitally, and then enhanced with search engines powered by languagetechnologies, such as spelling error detection.This paper highlights the work done by researchers at Fiontar, Dublin City University (DCU) in theidentification of valuable non-digital language resources, the digitisation of these resources wherenecessary, and the application of web, database, and language technology to these resources to widenaccess and availability, and to increase effectiveness and usability.Fiontar?s tools and resources include public websites that provide easy, user-friendly access to Irish-language terminological, lexicographical, onomastic, and folkloristic data stocks, as well as web-basedtools for managing and developing this data.
User-friendliness is seen by Fiontar as key in the promo-tion of the language on the Internet (M?chura and ?
Raghallaigh, 2009).
Single query, all-in-oneGoogle-like search, is also a priority, with sophisticated quick search being a feature on all Fiontarwebsites.

License details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/66guage throughout the whole island of Ireland, researchers at Fiontar began development of the Nation-al Terminology Database for Irish, focal.ie (focal ?word?).
Retro-digitisation (where a work that waspreviously published on paper is converted into a digital, computer-readable format) was carried outon 54 different dictionaries and term lists supplied by the Terminology Committee of Foras na Gaeilge(Bhreathnach, 2007), and the dataset was imported into a purpose-built relational database for termi-nological and lexicographical data (M?chura, 2006).
In addition, two web-based interfaces to the newdatabase were developed.
The first, a password-protected web application, provided a geographicallydispersed group of authorised terminologists with access to the data as well as a set of web-based toolsfor editing and developing the data.
The second, a public website, gave public access to the data via aset of linguistically sophisticated (e.g.
inflection awareness, misspelling detection, language selection)search tools (M?chura, 2008; M?chura and ?
Raghallaigh, 2010).
This meant that for the first time,Irish-language users, most notably language professionals, had free and searchable worldwide elec-tronic access to this valuable data stock.The focal.ie system continues to be maintained and developed today.
The database currently con-tains over 342,000 terms, mostly in Irish and English.
The technology has gone through a number ofmajor overhauls.
Most notably, the database and (private) editorial interface were replaced in 2012with a new system called L?acslann (M?chura, 2012b).
In L?acslann, terminological data is nowstored as XML.
L?acslann also incorporates additional features such as user permission management,a power search feature which allows users to interrogate the data in complex ways, and an extranetapplication to gather input from external subject and language experts.
And in 2013, the public searchalgorithm was optimised for speed and enhanced with better spelling-error detection.One of the advantages of the L?acslann system is that multiple data stocks can be stored and man-aged in the same database.
This allows the editorial tools to be reused across multiple terminology andlexicography projects.
The system now hosts multiple lexical databases being maintained and devel-oped by Fiontar language experts.
It also has the potential to be used to host terminology and lexicog-raphy projects for other institutions and languages, as it is flexible and customisable.
It can be used towork with various kinds of stocks such as monolingual and bilingual dictionaries, terminology data-bases or indeed any sort of reference work.
L?acslann stocks can accommodate any language and anycombination of languages, as long as text in those languages can be encoded in Unicode (M?chura,2012b).
This might prove to be an economical way to develop such resources for other low-resourcedlanguages such as Scottish Gaelic, for example.Corpora for use in lexicography have also been developed.
One such corpus, a parallel Irish-Englishcorpus of Irish and European legal texts, made available to Fiontar by the Irish Government and theEuropean Commission, known as ParaDocs, has been made available to the public on gaois.ie.3 OnomasticsIn 2007, in partnership with the Placenames Branch of the Government of Ireland, the body that con-ducts research into the placenames of Ireland to provide authoritative Irish language versions of thoseplacenames for official and public use, researchers at Fiontar began development of the PlacenamesDatabase of Ireland, logainm.ie (logainm ?placename?).
A new relational database for bilingual Irish-English toponymic data was purpose-built for the project, and data already digitised by the Place-names Branch was imported into this database (Mac Giolla Easpaig, 2009).
The architecture adoptedfor the terminology project was reflected in the placenames project in that two web interfaces, onepublic and one private (editorial), were built on top of the placenames database to allow disseminationas well as distributed editing and development of the data via the web (M?chura and ?
Raghallaigh,2012).A mapping interface, which used Google maps, was added to the public website in 2010, and in2014, the data structure was enhanced with the inclusion of place clusters.
These so-called clustersbetter reflect how people think about ?places?
such as Donegal, for example.
People don't normallythink about the distinction between the various administrative units called ?Donegal?
in County Done-gal (i.e.
the parish, townland, town, and electoral division), all of which are stored as distinct objects inthe placenames database, but rather think of just one place, Donegal.
The new data structure allowsclustered place objects to be grouped and presented in a more user-friendly way (M?chura, 2012a).67Other developments include a collaboration with the Digital Repository of Ireland to make the da-taset available as Linked Data, i.e.
as exposed RDF data objects that are linked to equivalent objects inother geodatasets such as GeoNames (Lopes et al., 2013), and a project to match the dataset with Ord-nance Survey Ireland so that logainm.ie data can be displayed on OSi maps, and in turn so that thosemaps can be used in place of Google Maps on the website (Byrne et al., 2013).
As of May 2014, theEnglish and Irish versions of the OSi medium-scale Basemap are being used on logainm.ie in place ofGoogle Maps (Satellite View).Data, some of which has to be digitised (originating on maps or on hand-written cards, for exam-ple), continues to be added to the placenames database, and development is ongoing.
Additional re-sources such as maps, articles, and educational resources are also added periodically.
The databasecurrently contains entries for over 108,000 geographic places on the island of Ireland.Another onomastic project, which has recently been established aims to produce a surnames data-base, which will group related Irish and English surnames.
The intention is to use the database to en-hance the names search interface to the folklore collection described in Section 4, and to make thisdatabase freely available to search or to download and reuse.
The project is in its infancy and will befully reported on at a later date.4 FolkloristicsIn 2012, in partnership with the the National Folklore Collection (NFC) at University College Dublin,home to one of the largest collections of oral and ethnological material in the world, researchers atFiontar began development of d?chas.ie (d?chas ?heritage?
), a new digital version of the NFC.
Theproject was initially funded by the Government Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on apilot basis for one year (2012-13) and has now been funded from the same source for three more years(2013-16) to digitise, digitally catalogue, and publish online 14% of the NFC.
The NFC comprisesmultiple collections, including a music archive, a map archive, an audio and video archive, a collec-tion of paintings, and a collection of photographs.
One collection in particular, a manuscript collectioncomprising handwritten stories, gathered as part of a Government-sponsored scheme in 1937-39, hasbeen chosen as the first collection to be migrated to d?chas.ie.
Known as The Schools?
Collection, itwas chosen primarily due to its popularity (?
Cl?irc?n et al., forthcoming).Since The Schools?
Collection comprises manuscript only, digitisation in its case involves the scan-ning of pages to create digital image files.
The text written on these pages is not being transcribed, asthis would be not be feasible, but a digital catalogue of the pages and the stories written on them isbeing compiled as part of the project, to make the collection electronically searchable.
It is envisagedthat 46% of the Schools?
Collection, i.e.
c. 339,000 pages, will be scanned and catalogued by 2016.As with the terminology/lexicography and the placenames projects, the d?chas.ie project comprisestwo web applications, one public and one private (editorial), and two databases, one for each web ap-plication.
The public system is used to present the digitised collections to the world, and provides theuser with a number of search interfaces.
Currently, The Schools?
Collection can be searched by person(the names of the people who told or collected the stories) or by place (where the stories were collect-ed).
The private system is used to manage and edit the digital catalogue.
The contents of the privatedatabase are transferred to the public database weekly.
In this instance, the L?acslann platform wasreused, and a customised editorial/management application was added for this data stock.5 Digitisation, management, and disseminationExpertise in digitisation project management, as well as web-based data management and publicationhas allowed Fiontar to transition other Irish language legacy data stocks to the web.
One example isthe biographies database, ainm.ie (ainm ?name?).
This project involved the digitisation of nine physicalvolumes of biographies (c. 1,700 lives) written and published between 1986 and 2007.
Once again,this resource has been digitised, managed online, and published online with associated electronicbrowsing, navigation, and search tools, all of which involved the reuse of existing infrastructure, tech-nologies, and expertise.
Another example is the legacy research sound archive of the PlacenamesBranch, which is accessible to researchers at http://www.logainm.ie/phono/.686 Technologies and hostingAll of the projects described here were built using web and database technologies.
The Microsoft.NET Framework and SQL Server platform were used in each case.
Hosting for all websites and data-bases is provided by DCU Information Systems and Services in conjunction with the HEAnet.
Binaryfiles created for the d?chas.ie project are hosted by UCD Research IT.7 ConclusionThis paper described some of the tools and resources for Irish developed and made available online byFiontar, Dublin City University, as well as the web and database technologies utilised in their deploy-ment.
It was highlighted that all of these tools and resources encompass technologically and linguisti-cally sophisticated search interfaces.
The use of technology in this way to enhance the resources avail-able to Irish-language users and professionals is serving to place their language-related activities on amore level playing field with their major language counterparts, and goes some way towards the pro-motion and protection of the language.AcknowledgementsThis research was undertaken with support from Fiontar, Dublin City University.
