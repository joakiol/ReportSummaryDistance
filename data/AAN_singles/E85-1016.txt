This a t t i tude has atleast two drawbacks:  First ly,  there is noformal way of compar ing  two models;  thiscan  lead  to  some po in t less  d i scuss ionsbetween d i f fe rent  approaches  wh ich ,  a tan abstract  level, can be shown to beequivalent;  secondly,  any extens ion  ormod i f i ca t ion  of the implemented  modelrequi res  a d i f fe rent  program instead ofa mere ad justment  at the abstract  levelwh ich  should fac i l i ta te  the modularupdat in~ of the imp lementat ion  and a l lowa formal compar i son  between the old andthe new model.Our work  on tense -and t ime hasconv inced us that, espec ia l l y  inl ingu is t ic  domains  where  models  areeither loose or controvers ia l ,  asystemat ic  approach to l ingu is t icin fo rmat ion  process in~ a l low ingcompat ib le  const ruct ions  at all levels ish igh ly  des i rable .

At first it seems qui tereasonab le  to break the programs intomanageable ,  modular  sub-programs0espec ia l ly  as the l ingu is t ic  data, atleast at f irst approx imat ion , lendthemselves  to a c lear -cut  c lass i f i ca t ionin terms of morphology,  syntax, semant icsand pra~mat ics .
Moreover ,  comparat ive lysoph is t i ca ted  techn iques  and methods  area l ready ava i lab le  in eachsubf ie ld .Unfor tunate ly ,  it has now become107commonplace  knowledge  that this s t ra tegyof deve lop ing  separate  modules  for eachsub-prob lem and in tegrat in~ them smooth lyis not sat is factory :  the operat ions  ofpars ing  sentences,  p roduc ing  internalrepresentat ions ,  reason ing  about them,answer in~ quest ions,  generat in~ text, andso on, are s t rong ly  in terdependent .
Thedegree, order and locat ion  of thein teract ions  between d i f fe rent  parts  mayvary s ign i f i cant ly ,  accord ing  toind iv idual  s i tuat ions.A consequence  of the rea l i za t ion  ofthis fact has been the deve lopment  ofs t rong ly  integrated,  usua l ly  procedura lsystems, where  the ind iv idua l  sub-programs operate  s imu l taneous ly  onseveral  deep ly  in t r i ca ted  l ingu is t iclevels .
The pr ice one has to pay for are la t ive  success  of  this approach  is interms of unders tandab i l i ty  and~enera l i za t ion :  many systems are s t rong lydependent  on the par t i cu la r  type ofp rob lem they have been programmed tosolve, and poss ib le  extens ions  ort ranspou i t ions  wou ld  requ i re  fundamenta lmod i f i cat ions .Uhat k ind of so f tware  tools  wou lda l low at the same t ime modu lar i ty  andmul t i - faceted ,  po lymorph ic  and concurrentin teract ions  between processes  ?Modu lar i ty  and complex  in teract ions  arecharacter i s t i c  features of the objector iented parad igm .Modu lar i ty  iS p rov ided  by thes t ruc turat ion  in terms of objects.Complex  in teract ion  is a consequence  ofthe d i s t r ibut ion  of the control  betweent~e d i f ferent  ob jects  and of the(poss ib ly  mul t ip le )  inher i tancefac i l i t ies  between h ie rarch ica l lydependent  objects.
The poss ib i l i ty  ofus ing d i f ferent  points  of  views fOr  thesame objects  is a consequence  of thiss t ructurat ion.This approach leads to focuss ing onthe basic process  of abstract ion.
Inthis context,  abs t rac t ion  is a processwhich, s tar t ing  from a descr ip t ion  of thedata, y ie lds an abstract  spec i f i cat ion .This involves three steps.- def ine the re levant  ob jects  for theprob lem under study;- def ine the poss ib le  funct ions  andre lat ions  on the objects;-give exp l i c i t l y  the const ra in tsbetween the funct ions and re lat ions.The ob jec t -o r iented  approach  isusua l ly  equated wi th  the Smal l ta lk"v is ion"  ( Go ldberg  and Robson,  1983 ),whi le  other v iews of ob jects  are re jec tedas be ing i r re levant  or even selfcontradictory .Smal l ta lk  ob jects  can be character i zedby the fo l lowing propert ies :- Each object  is an instance of a c lass(a gener ic  object) .- Each object  has a local memory  wh ichcan only  be updated  by funct ions  (orp rocedures)  local  to the object.- Objects  are o rsan lzed  into a t ree - l l keh ie rarchy  imply in~ t ree - l i ke  inher i tance.- Communicat ion  between ob jects  iso rgan ized  through message  pass ing.However  ,it has been argued that theobject  o r iented  approach  can bef ru i t fu l l y  carr ied  over into app l i ca t ivelanguage contexts  (Steels  ,198Z) or intopar t i cu la r  systems based on lo~ic wherethe fundamenta l  mechan ism is dataabst rac t ion  (Goguen et al 1983).As regards  Smal l ta lk ,  it does notp rov ide  sys temat ic  fac i l i t ies  forde f ln in~ abst ract  data  types; allcomputat ions  are h igh ly  dependent  on s ideef fects  (ass i?nment  is sys temat ica l lyused in local operat ions )  and there is noexpl ic i t  typing.ge favour the approach  exempl i f ied  bysuch lan?uaaes  as OBJ and thei r  poss ib leextens ions  (Goguen and Meseguer ,  1984),as we th ink  that they wi l l  a l low ,in thelon~ range, a more ef f ic ient  p rogrammingsty le  and make the sys temat ic  proof  ofp rograms poss ib le .The OBJ languaQe is based upon dataabst ract ion:  an object  i s  a type (i.e.
adomain  of va lues  wi th  funct ions  access ingthose values) ;  ob jects  a re  organ ized  intoa h ie rarchy  ( an acyc l ic  ~raph)represent in~ the dependenc ies  amongtypes.
Computat ions  are per fo rmed byus ing equat lona l  ax ioms as o r ientedrewr i te  rules.There fore  , g ranted  the ava i lab i l i tyof a theorem prover  , the  cons is tency  ofthe spec i f i ca t ions  g iven in the abst ractdata type can be fo rmal ly  checked.
More-over , s ince the ob jects  have a c learmathemat ica l  def in i t ion ,  all thetechn iques  of abstract  a lgebra  are alsoavai lable.More genera l ly ,  ax ioms could be g ivennot on ly  as equat ions  .
but also asformulas in a logical  theory  (such asf irst order  p red icate  ca lcu lus  ortempora l  logics) assuming  those theor iessat i s fy  some g iven res t r i c t ions  ( Goguenand Bursta11,  1984).As we have no access yet to anyvers ion  of OBJ, we have dec ided  , in af irst stage, to rest r ic t  the objects t ructure  to its free component ,  i.e.only the s ignatures ,  not the axioms aredef ined.
Therefore~ the computat ions  haveto be exp l i c i te ly  coded.
As aconsequence,,  no check ing  of cons is tency108is poss ib le  for the t ime being.The actual  imp lementat ion  is done inthe ML language (Gordon et al, 1979).ML is a funct ional  language which  isful ly h igher -order .
"It has a po lymorph ictype  d isc ip l ine  wh ich  combines thef lex ib i l i ty  of  programming in a type lesslanguage with the secur i ty  of  compi le -t ime type checking".
Moreover ,  one c a ndef ine one's own types , which may beabstract  and/or  recurs ive.To give a f lavour of the MLprogramming style, cons ider  a poss ib lede f in i t ion  of the abstract  recurs ive  typeof b inary  trees, wi th  tip va lues  ofan arb i t ra ry  type  (denoted  by  * )  and  nont ip  nodes  o f  some other  a rb i t ra ry  type(denoted by **).
(This exemple is takenfrom Gordon et al, 1979):absrectype  (*,**) t ree  =* + **  # ( * , ** ) t ree  # ( * , ** ) t reewith t iptree x = abs_t ree  (inl x)and comptree (y,t l , t2)  =abs_tr(~u (inr (y , t l , t2))and istip t = is l ( rep_ t ree  t)and tipof t= out l ( rept ree  t)and labelof  t = fSt(OUtr  ( reptree t))and sonof t =snd(out r ( rept ree  t))This type is def ined as recurs ive  andabstract.
The symbols  "+" and "#"respect ive ly ,  denote the two typeconst ructors  "d is jo int  sum" and"car tes ian  product"  The funct ions"abs_tree"  and "rep_tree"  ,both of themof  type  (ty -> ty), are only ava i lab leinside the de f in i t ion  of  the abstracttype "tree" : abs_t ree  maps the concreterepresentat ion  of a tree unto itsabstract ion;  rep_t ree  has the converseeffect.
Final ly,  isl, inl, inr, outl,outr are funct ions or pred icates  on thed is jo int  sum.
They are def ined asfol lows:isl: (* + **) -> booltests membersh ip  of  left summand;inl: * -> (* + **)in jects into left summand;inr: * -> (** + *)in jects into r ight summand;outl :  (* + **) -> *projects  out left summand;out r :  (* + **) -> **pro jects  out r ight summand.The s ignature  of this type is the setof operators:t iptree=-:  * -> (** ,* ) t reecomptree=-:?
# (** ,* ) t ree # (** ,* ) t ree  ->(* , ** ) t reeist ip=-: (* ,** ) t ree ->boolt ipof=-: (* ,** ) t ree ->**l~be lo f=- : ( * , ** )  tree -> *sonof=-:( * , ** ) t ree  ->( (** , * ) t ree  # (** , * )  t ree) )The vers ion  of ML we use ( INRIA ,1984)is wr i t ten  in Lisp wi th  access to thel isp system.
So our object  env i ronment  isconst ructed  as a co l lec t ion  of abst ractdata types.
The h ie rarchy  between typesresu l ts  from the combinat ion  andenr ichment of more basic types.
Thish ie rarchy  creates mul t ip le  inher i tancere la t ions  between types.
Some exampleswi l l  be g iven in the context  of tempora lob jects .Clearly,  the management  of the objectlevel must be done on top of ML Theexpl ic i t  cod ing mixes Lisp and ML.As we work in a funct iona l  env i ronmentthere is no "local memory" .However ,  thisis , to our v iewpoint ,  a minor  d rawbackcompared to the advantage  of theabst rac t ion  fac i l i t ies .In a next stage, we intend to in t roducethe necessary  axioms and per fo rm thecomputat ions  in a deduct ive  style.This approach can be used for theformal representat ion  of natura llanguage, or as a grammar formal i sm .
Inpar t i cu la r  the syntact ica l  and semant ica lana lys is  can be done in terms of objects.
(De Bo iss ieu  and Forest  , 1985).PROCESSING TEHPORAL INFORMATIONTense and t ime representat ion  in natura llanguages is genera l ly  s tudied underone of the three main d i sc ip l ines  :logics, l inguist ics ,  and art i f i c ia linte l l igence.
A br ief  overv iew of these4 di f ferent  v lewpo lnts  is g iven in(Bestougef f  an Ligozat,  1984).The main prob lem is to choose there levant  ob jects  in order to get anadequate  abstract ion.
It must be s t rong lyemphas ized that we deny ourse lves  ther ight to assume any par t i cu la r  phys ica lrepresentat ion  of t ime from the outset.The concrete  proper t ies  result  from thespec i f i cat ions .The choice of the basic  objects  issomehow arbitrary,  but it shouldnever the less  comply  to the fo l lowingrules :the objects  must be- c lose to l ingu is t ic  intuit{on.- general  enough to be reusab le  assuch in d i f fe rent  contexts,  or give r iseto new objects  by enr ichment  orinher i tance.The second point is requ i red  to avoid109ad-hoc and independant  spec i f i cat ions .
Toach ieve these goals  it may be necessaryto def ine pr imi t ive  objects,  wh ich  do nothave any l ingust ic  in terpreta t ion  but aremere ly  bu i ld inE  b locks whose use enhancesmodu lar i tyIn this case ,the lower level ob jects  canbe h idden to the userKeeping this in mind ,we can nowproceed to the descr ip t ion  of thel ingu is t ic  mot ivat ions  wh ich  are beh indthe const ruct ion  of tempora l  ob jectsThe idea is to ~ive a sys temat ic  way ofrepresent ing  tempora l  in fo rmat ion  bydef in ing  abstract  s t ructures  based uponthe concepts  and the hypotheses  of apar t i cu la r  l ingu is t ic  theory.The l ingu is t ic  theory  we re ly  on isthat of A. Cul io l i  (Cul iol i ,  1980),su i tab ly  adapted to computat iona lpurposes.Tempora l  in fo rmat ion  can be in fo rmal lycharacter i zed  as in fo rmat ion  per ta in ingto the locat ion and "shape" of the statesand events descr ibed  by natura l  language.I n  part icu lar ,  this inc ludes what iscommonly  re fer red  to as aspect.Furthermore,  tempora l  in fo rmat ion  innatura l  language has both a descr ip t iveand an operat ive  structure:  it descr ibesand a l lows the users to make sys temat icinferences.
Among these in ferences  arethose concerned wi th  the order ing  ofevents, but such in ferences  are on ly  parto~ a whole set of in ferences  on thefactual i ty,  the degree of complet ion,  thetype of occurrence,  of the s i tuat ionscons idered.
In fact, it can be arguedthat the order ing  re la t ions  are notnecessar i l y  of a p r imary  nature.Some examples wil l  i l l us t ra te  thek ind of data and in ferences  we have inmind.Cons ider  the fo l lowing s implesentences:(i) John is ill.(2 )  John repa i rs  cars.
(33 John is repa i r ing  my car.
(4) John repa i red  my car.
(5) John has repa i red  my car.
(6 )  John was repa i r ing  my car.
(7) My car has been repaired.
(83 My car is repa i red  now.
(9) John was singing.
(i0) John sang.
(Ii) John has been singing.
(12) Cats are smart.We wish to account  for some basicin format ion  imparted by the use of suchsentences.
For example:- Sentence (2) does not imply (3),ne i ther  does sentence (3) imply sentence(2).- Sentence  (4) impl ies  sentence  (7), not(8 ) .- Sentence  (5) impl ies sentence  (8).- Sentence  (6) impl ies  ne i ther  sentence(7) nor, a fort ior i ,  (8), whereassentence (9) impl ies  sentences  ( i0) , ( i i ) .The d i f fe rent  uses of the s implepresent  tense in (I) and (Z) are re la tedto a d i f fe rence  between the semant ictypes of the verbs t_So bee i l i  and torepair.
We wi l l  account  for thisd i f fe rence  by adapt ing  a c lass i f i ca t ion(essent ia l l y  due to Vend ler  (1967)) intofour semant ic  types ( state, act iv i ty ,accompl i shement ,  ach ievement  ) .
Theuse fu lness  of  such a c lass i f i ca t ion  isfurther  i l l us t ra ted  by compar ing  thebehav iour  Of the verb to repa i r  insentences  (6, 7, 8) w i th  that of the verbt So s in~ in (9, 10, 11).The compar i son  between (4) and (6) inre la t ion  wi th  (7) shows the necess i ty  ofsu i tab ly  represent ing  the d i f fe rencebetween the s imple  and the progress ivepast, at least for verbs of the type torepai r  a car , which  are c lass i f ied  asaccompl i shments .To represent  the d i f fe rence  between(4) (s imple past)  and (5) (presentperfect) ,  we have to express what makes(8), but not (4), der ivab le  from (5).Re ichenbach 's  system of tempora l  indexes(point of speech, point  of event, pointof re fe rence  ) can be used to hand lethis phenomenon (Reichenbach,  1957 ).
Itp rov ides  a way of descr ib in~ the not ionof "present  re levance" ,  wh ich  is presentin (5) , but not in (4).The contrast  between (1 , 2) and (12.
)po ints  to another  k ind of d i s t inc t ion  onehas to make: (i) expresses  a state, (2) ahabit,  wh ich  hold at the moment  ofspeech.
On the contrary,  (12) states agenera l  fact wh ich  is bas ica l lyundetermined  wi th  respect  to the momentof speech.
Dependence  on the t ime ofspeech is a fact of tempora l  deixis .
Ueshal l  refer  to it as enuns ia t iv i t  Z ,( fo l lowing A. Cul io l i )  .
By oppos i t ions i tuat ions  such as (12) wi l l  be termedaor ist ic .The preced ing  examples give sume ideaof the type of in fo rmat ion  that has to berepresented.
We have de l iberate ly  p layeddown the pure ly  sequent ia l  type ofin format ion,  wh ich  is the only type oftempora l  in fo rmat ion  most systems areconcerned with.Moreover ,  the pure ly  sequent ia ltype of in fo rmat ion  is most ly  incomplete110(this is s t ressed in par t i cu la r  by Smith(1978)).
Cons ider  the fo l lowina examples:(13) John saw his doctor  this morn ing:he is ill.(14) John saw his doctor  this morning:now he is ill.Cont ras t in~ (13) and (14) shows apotent ia l  indeterminacy  in the re la t ionbetween the two sentences.
Smi th  (1978)c la ims that sentences  l ike (I), where  noexpl ic i t  " re ference  t ime" is p rov ided(e.g.
by a t ime adverb ia l  such as now)are tempora l ly  incomplete.
Ue wi l l  becontent  at this point  of our d i scuss ionwith not in~ the need for a conven ientnotat ion  for such a phenomenon.TEMPORAL OBJECTSUe assume that tempora l  in fo rmat ionin a text can be represented  byproceed in~ in  th ree  s teps  o f  inc reas in~di f f icu l ty :- Tense in main c lauses.- Tense in subord inate  clauses.- Tense in texts.This h ie rarchy  fo l lows that Of E jerhedand Janlert  ( 1981).To summar ize  the d i scuss ion  of theprev ious  paragraph,  the fo l lowinae lements of temporal  in fo rmat ion  have tobe abstracted:- temporal  de ix is  (enunc iat ive  vs.aor is t ic  s i tuat ions)  .
Fo l low in~ Comr ie(1976), we use the term "s i tuat ion"  as agener ic  term cover in~ states, events orprocesses  .- incept ion and te rminat ion  of as i tuat ion.- in format ion  re la t ive  to thecomplet ion  of the s i tuat ion.- local in ferences  on s i tuat ions.- mass/count  p roper t ies  of s i tuat ions.In our system, these e lements arereconst ruc ted  from the fo l lowin~l ingu is t ic  data:- tenses in the f in ite forms of verbs.temporal  spec i f ie rs  ( temporaladverb ia ls ) .- semant ic  types of s i tuat ions(computed from the semant ic  type of theverbs & la Vendler ,  and the syntact ics t ructure  of the propos i t ion) .At this point, most ex is t in~ systemsof representat ion  make a choice, s ince anot ion of durat ion  has to be inc luded inthe model as well.
E i ther  one conce ivesof the basic e lements  as points,  and thenot ion  of an interval  has to beintroduced;  or an interva l  is a bas icelement, and a second re la t ion  (ofover lapp lna  or inc lus ion  ) is int roduced.In fact, in most ex is t ina  models  of time,the bas ic  e lements  of t ime are conce ivedas e lements  or  subsets  of (a subset  o?
)the real l ine (or some rami f ied  s t ruc turebui l t  from it).The choice of e i ther  "po ints"  or" in terva ls"  as bas ic  e lements  leads tode f in i te  advantages  and par t i cu la rd i f f i cu l t ies .
The point  model  isbas ica l l y  s impler,  but  in some way harderto just i fy  semant ica l ly .
However,  asshown by Kamp (1979)  and Van Benthem( 1980 ), both po ints  of v iews areessent ia l l y  equivalent .Our c la im in the matter  fo l lows the~enera l  ph i losophy  of abst ract ion:Instead o?
the nature  of the  basicelements,  cons ider  their  in tendedproper t ies  and combinat ion  ru les  forbu i ld in~ der ived  elements.
Thiscombinator ia l  point  of v iew is impl ic i t ,for example, in A l len ' s  model  (Al len 83),where  a set of " in terva ls"  is abs t rac t lycharacter i zed  by the re la t ions  ho ld in~between its e lements.
It can be shown(Bestou~ef f  and L i~ozat  ,1984) that anyset theor i t i c  model  of A l len 's  ax ioms isequ iva lent  to (a subset)  of the in terva ls(that is, couples  of points)  on a to ta l lyordered set.In our mode l , the  bas ic  e lements  aretyped boundar ies ,  w i th  a (part ia l )  orderdef ined on them.
As shown in (Bestougef fand L i~ozat,  1984) an a l te rnat ive  way ofcons ider in~ the same abst rac t ion  wou ld  bein terms of " interva ls" ,  where  aninterval  is a couple  (bl, b2) ofboundar ies  wi th  bl <b2 .
In other  words,the term " interva l "  has only  the not ionsof a be~inn ina  and an end assoc ia ted  wi thit, and it is immater ia l  whether  one orthe other te rmino logy  is used.
Notopo lowica l  p~oper t ies  are impl ied  , onlycombinator ia l  p roper t ies  (in terms of thetypes of boundar ies  ) are re ta ined  in theabstract ion.
Boundary  types arein t roduced in the model  in order  torepresent  aspectua l  p roper t ies  of thedata.As an example, cons ider  againsentences  (1) to (12).The state be ill in (i) ho lds upon aninterval  whose left and r ight boundar iesare "c los ing"  and "opening",respect ive ly .
This is a general  s i tuat ionfor states in an enunc ia t ive  sett ing.The event John repai r  my ca.._~ in (5),converse ly ,  holds upon an interval  w i thresp.
"opening"  and "c los ina"  left andr ight boundar ies .
Consequent ly ,  thead jacent  resu l t in~ state "my car isrepa i red"  holds on an interva l  w i th  a111"closing" left boundary,  as a stateshould.
The combinat ion  in (5) of a verbof accompl i shment  wi th  a "c los ing"  r ishtboundary  insures that such a resu l t ingstate does indeed exist.
This is to becont rasted  wi th  the s i tuat ion  in (6 ) .There, the r ight boundary  is an "open ingone", wh ich  prevents  the in ference of acompleted  act ion from bein8 made?It seems that the in t roduct ion  ofsuch typed boundar ies  is enough tocapture  the in tu i t ion  beh ind the use oftopo log ica l  interva ls  in systemsrepresent ing  tense and time.
The approachchosen here prevents  the over load ing  ofthe ob jects  w i th  unnecessary  orundes i rab le  propert ies ,  as is the casewhen a concrete  model  l ike the real l inei s  adopted .In  te rms o f  imp lemented  ob jec ts ,  th i scor responds  to  the  de f in i t ion  o f  abst rac tin terva ls  from typed boundar ies  andpred icate  in fo rmat ion  (the latter  can beempty) .AS an example , the expl ic i tde f in i t ion  of an interval  is as fo l lows :abstype intv =boundary  # pred# boundarywi th  make_ in tv  (11,12,13)=abs_ in tv  (11,12,13)and left I =fst (rep intv i)and r ight 1 = snd (snd ( rep_ intv  i))and 8etp 1 =fst (snd ( rep_ Intv  l))and purl (b, i)=if fst ( rep_ intv  i) =Uthen abs_ in tv  (b , f s t ( snd( rep_ in tv ) ) ,snd(snd ( rep_ intv  i ) ) )else iand putr (b , i )=if snd(snd( rep_ in tv  i)) = Uthen abs_ in tv ( f s t ( rep_ in tv  i),f s t ( snd( rep_ in tv  i)) ,b)else iand show_ intv  1 =rep_ in tv  i;;The s ignature  of this object  is theset of typed operators:make_ in#v=-:(boundary # pred# boundary)  -> intvle~t=-: intv -> boundaryr ight=-: intv -> boundarygetp =-: intv -> predpurl =-: (boundary#in#v)  -> intvpurr =-: (boundary # intv ) -> intvshow intv =-:intv ->( intv  + (intv # nseq))It seems in tu i t i ve ly  sa t i s fy ing  tocons ider  the s t retch of t ime invo lved ina s imple c lause as to ta l ly  ordered.
Thelocal in ferences  operate  on thisres t r i c ted  scope.To abstract  this phenomenon wein t roduce interval  sequences  w i thconst ra in ts  on the boundary  types ofad jacent  intervals:absrectype  nseq= intv + in# # nseqforce=-: intv -> nseqncons=- : ( in tv#nseq)  -> nseqmake tnseq=- : ( in tv  # nseq) -> nseqshow nseq=-:nseq -> ( intv + ( intv # nseq))The centra l  object  in the modelcor responds  to a s imple  clause.
It isca l led a po ly typed  stt-ing (or PTS).
It isobta ined from an interval  sequence byadd in~ the in fo rmat ion  about tempora lindexes a la Re ichenbach:abstype  pts  =nseq  # indexmake_pts=- : ( (nseq  #index) -> pts)fl=-: pred -> ptsf2=-: pred -> ptsfn=- :  p red  -> ptsrules:- :(status # tense # vend ler  # adverb ia l )-> pred -> pts)apply rules =-:(p red  # status)  -> ptswhere  the funct iona l  type "pred-> pts"denotes  the set of funct ions  wh ich  bu i ldPTS's from pred icate  in format ion.The pred icate  in fo rmat ion  is g iventhrough the " ru les"  where  "status"  isthe in fo rmat ion  re la t ive  to theenunc ia t ive  vs. aor i s t i c  status;  " tense"denotes  the morpho log ica l  tense of theclause, "vendler"  , the Vend ler  c lass(i.e.
state, act iv i ty ,  accompl i shementor ach ievement  ) computed from c lasse(s )ass igned to verbs in the d ic t ionary  andthe syntact i ca l  conf igurat ions  ; f ina l ly"adverb ia l "  cor responds  to in fo rmat ionat tached to the t ime adverb ia ls .Up to this point  , we have descr ibedthe fundamenta ls  of the sys tem ofrepresentat ion .
Of course, the actualconst ruct ion  of the representat ivetemporal  object  for a text in a g ivenlanguage is h igh ly  language dependent .For instaxlce, the present  tense in French(which is the language we are work ing  on)is not in a s imple cor respondance  wi ththe "cor respond ing"  s imple  present  inEngl ish.
Consequent ly  , re fe r r in~ to theob jects  descr ibed  above, the funct ions"fi", and "ru les"  are qu i te  spec i f i c  tothe s t ruc ture  of the languagerepresented.The tempora l  re la t ions  in longer uni tsof d i scourse  are comparat ive ly  much moreloose ly  speci f ied.
Cons ider  the fo l low ing112example:(15) Shakespeare  is dead.
John is ili.And I am not feel in~ wel l  either.Apart  from cons iderat ions  per ta in in~to rea l -wor ld  knowledge,  no in fo rmat ionis g iven about the re la t ive  order  of thebeg inn ings  of the three s i tuat ionsconsidered.
So the representat ion  shoulda l low for indeterminacy ,  either inl i s t in~ all poss ib le  a l te rnat ives  (thiswou ld  be the case in A l len ' s  model) ,  orin leaving the order unspec i f ied .
Thismore economical  so lu t ion  is chosen here.Compare  (15) to the fo l lowin@:(16) Mary  ~ot pregnant .
She marr ied  John.
(17) Mary  marr ied  John.
She got pregnant .Here, the order  of d i scourse  seemspert inent  and should  be represented.More complex examples  in this respectare:(18)  John  was angry  when Mary dropped theV as e .
(19) Mary  dropped the vaue.
John wasansry.
(20) John was angry.
Mary  dropped thevas e.where (19) or a l te rnat ive ly  (20) can be aparaphrase  of (18).The preced in~ d iscuss ion  shows thatthe total o rder ing  at the sentence levelcannot in ~eneral  be extended to lar~erunits in a s imple  way.
The eventualre la t ions  between d i f fe rent  s implesentences  are a result  of a computat ionmakin~ use of the tempora l  s t ruc ture  ofthose sentences  and the order ofd iscourse.This fact is captured  as fol lows: Thes t ructure  represent in~ a text isconst ruc ted  stepwise.
At each step of theconstruct ion,  the exls t in~ s t ruc tureprov ides  a context,  in wh ich  the order ofd iscourse,  in part icu lar ,  is represented.In technica l  terms, the cor respond ingobject is ca l led " tempora l  site".
It iscomposed of a sequence of PTS's togetherwi th  a set of re la t ions  on the boundar iesof the const i tuent  PTS's .So the nextsentence to be examined, taken inisolat ion,  is represented  by a poss ib lyincomplete  s t ructure  (a po ly typed  str ing)with a total order on it, but wi thposs ib le  indeterminac ies  (for example, inthe ass ignment  of t ime indexes).
This news t ructure  is inserted into the old one,(a l ready const ruc ted  tempora l  site )thereby creat in~ new const ra in tsresu l t ing  in the eva luat ion  of someundetermined  parameters  in bothstructures.Here a~ain, the prec i se  combinat ionrules are lanKua~e speci f ic ,  as theydepend on the semant ic  p roper t ies  of thet ime re la t ions  in the lan~uaae.It is beyond the scope of this paper?o g ive the ru les  used for French.However  ?o ~ive an ind icat ion  of what theconst ruc t ion  amounts  to , cons ider  thefo l lowing engl ish  sentences:(21) John was in love wi th  Nary;(22) John has bui l t  his house;(23) John was bu i ld ing  his house when Ileft for Rome.The ana lys is  of (21) yields:tense : s imple  past;s tatus : enunc ia t ive  (by defaul t ) ;vend ler  :state;adverb ia l  :none.Denot ing  by "p" the pred icat ion :  Johnis in love wi th  Mary, the s t ruc ture  ofthe represent ing  PTS can be Symbo l i zed  bythe formula  :C1 p O2 ~ 03 ($3 R2)where  the C's and O's denote  c los in8  andopen ing  boundar ies  and S and R ,po in ts  ofspeech and re ference  respect ive ly  .
Theseare indexed by the order  of occur rence  ofthe cor respond in~ boundar ies .
~ denotes  adummy pred icat ion .Cons ider  sentence (22)  Heretense : present  perfect ;s tatus : enunc ia t ive  (because of thepresent  per fect  tense);vend ler  : accompl i shment  (perfect  form);adverb ia l  : none.The formula  :01 p C2 res l t (p)  03 ($3 R3)descr ibes  the assoc ia ted  9TS, where  p isJohn bui lds  his house and res l t (p)  is aresu l t in~ state, obta ined  by localinference,  wh ich  expresses  : the house isbui l t  .F inal ly,  cons ider  sentence  (23) .
Theassoc ia ted  tempora l  s ite can besymbo l i zed  by:1: O1 p 02 ~ 032 :01  q C2 ~ 03($3,R2)(S3,R2)REL: 01:1 < 01:202:1 >= 01:2This tempora l  s ite conta ins  two FTS's,w i th  p = John bui lds  his house and q=I leave for Rome .q is an ach ievement  inVend ler ' s  c lass i f i cat ion .
The add i t iona lin fo rmat ion  concerns  the order ingre la t ions  between the boundar ies  of thePTS's, numbered  1 and 2.Ue have been main ly  concerned  w i ththe representat ion  of what we have termedenunc ia t ive  s i tuat ions  (as opposed  toaor is t ic  ones).
This is jus t i f ied  , as113such  s i tuat ions p lay  a central  role ind iscourse.
Concern ing  aor is t ics i tuat ions,  s imi lar  representat ives~ructures  are used, which are in factmore  st r ic t ly  constra ined.Habitual  s i tuat ions  (e.g.
sentence(2)) involve a par t i cu la r  t reatment  ofthe pred icat ive  component,  but o therwisefit into the general  scheme descr ibedabove.
From this point  of view, they areno d i f ferent  from factual s i tuat ions.D ispos i t iona l  sentences,  on the otherhand, cannot be d iscussed  wi thoutenter ing the domain of modal i t?.
A l thoughthis may seem a ser ious l imi tat ion(espec ia l ly  for Engl ish, where moda l i tyis all pervas ive  ), we leave it as ide inthe present cons iderat ion  of tense andtime.The preced ing d iscuss ion  i l lus t ratesthe use of l ingu is t ic  in ference at threed ist inct  levels:a) At the s imple  sentence level,bu i ld ing  a representat ion  involves afirst type of inference,  which makes useof morpho-syntact i c  and lex ico -semant icin format ion  .b) At the next h igher  level, asi l lust rated by  examples (15-20), anothertype of in ference is used to spec i fy  andbui ld  the cor respond ln~ s t ructures(temporal  sites).c) St i l l  another  k ind of l ln~uist icin ference should account  for the poss ib leder ivab i l i t ies  Or paraphras ings  ment ionedpr0pos examples (1-12).
Itsfo rmal i zat ion  should make it poss ib le  todescr ibe  this in ference which, s tar t ingfrom a ~iven temporal  s ite a l lows todeduce new sites from it.Whereas the first two types ofin ference are  const i tu t ive  of theder ivat ion  of temporal  s t ructures  and arecentral  to our act iv i ty,  the last typehas sti l l  to be def ined and examined in asystemat ic  way i.e.
def ined exp l i c i te lyas der ivat ion  rules.
In this context,  thefac i l i t ies  for se l f - re ference  andstructura l  in ference in the sof twareenvi ronment  are of pr imary  re levance.REFERENCESA l len , J .A .1983 Ma inta in ing  knowledgeabout temporal  intervals.
