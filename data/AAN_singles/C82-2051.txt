I n t roduct ionThis paper presents  a conceptua l  taxonomy of Japanesead jec t ives ,  succeeding that  on Japanese verbs ' .
In  th i s  taxo-n~ny, natura l  language i s  assoc ia ted  with rea l  world th ings  -- mat ter ,  events ,  a t t r ibutes  - and menta l  ac t iv i t ies  - sp i r i t -ual  and sensua l .
Ad ject ive  concepts are d iv ided in to  twolarge c lasses ,  s imple and non-s imple .
Simple concepts cannotbe reduced in to  fu r ther  e lementary ad jec t ive  concepts ,  whereasnon-s imple ones can be.
Roughly speaking,  s imple concepts areconcrete  and can be d i rec t ly  assoc ia ted  wi th  phys ica l  andmenta l  a t t r ibutes ,  whereas non-s imple ones are abst rac t  and in -d i rec t ly  assoc ia ted  with them.2.
Simple Ad ject ive  ConceptsVerb concepts  were we l l  understood as "change" f ro~ s ta teS O to state S 1 as shown in Fig.
14 Adjective concepts are con-sidered to be captured as the "d i f fe rence"  between ob jec ts  O Oand 0 I. Ylg.2 shows how the difference in vertical length be-tween 00 and 01 br ings  about the concept of "h igh".
Noticethat  sur face  s t ruc tures  o f ten  lack the express ion  of 00 l i ke"yama-ga taka i  (the mountain i s  h igh)" .
Since the meaning of"high" cannot be expressed only by O 1, deep s t ruc tures  needO 0 as an object for comparison.- 209 -changeState So State S,otoko-ga ie-kara deru.The man Koes out o-~hehouse.Fig.

2 The structure of adjective concept2.1  St ructura l  Pat te rnsAd jec t ive  concepts  can be regarded as the concept  of  are la t ion  among const i tuents  which produce d i f fe rence  and canbe represented  as fo l lows :Ad(C, e, o, of, Or, o m, os, i, l, t, r, ...) (1)where each symbol in  parentheses  tands fo r  a const i tuent .
Forexample, c and s s tand fo r  an ob jec t  fo r  ccmpar l lon  and a sub-~ect ,  respect ive ly .
Scae const i tuents  are  ob l igatory  in  thesense that  they  are ind ispensab le  in  the recogn i t ion  of  d i f fe r -ence.
Seven types of  s t ruc tura l  pat te rns  are proposed,  accord -ing to  the combinat ion of  ob l igatory  const i tuents .2.2 Semantic ContentsThe semantic contents  of  Ad in  formula (1) are categor i z~ed in to  phys ica l ,  menta l  and abst rac t  a t t r ibute .
We c lass i fyeach of  them in  deta i l  because we cannot detect  aDy d i f fe rence- 210  -vwithout  such in fo rmat ion .
In  the case of verbs ,  twenty cate -gor ies  such as d isp lacement ,  de fo~nst ion ,  and sp i r i tua l  ac t -i v i ty  were proposed to c lass i fy  the semantic contents  of"changes".
We modify them e l ight ly  to apply to the c lass i f i c -a t ion  of semantic contente  of ad jec t ives .
For example, d ie -placement and deformat ion are modi f ied to locat ion  and shape,respect ive ly .3.
Non-Simple Ad jec t ive  ConcepteNon-simple ad jec t ive  concepts are not d i rec t ly  assoc ia t -ed wi th  p~e isa l  or menta l  a t t r ibutee~ there fore  we emphasizean ana lys i s  of how they ere composed of s imple ones.3.1 Complex Concepts-AFor example, there  i s  a complex ad jec t ive  "hoso-nagai( th in - long)"  which i s  reg is tered  as one word in  o rd inaryJapanese d ic t ionar ies .
The conne0t i  ~ re la t ion  between twoad jec t ive  concepts i s  a log ica l  product in  th i s  case.
Thecomplex concept of A i s  def ined ss fo l lows :  i f  two ad jec t iveconcepts are connected by a ru le  and the connected concept i srepresented  by a complex word of those ad jec t ives ,  i t  i s  ca l l -ed a "complex concept of A".
Two types of connect ing  ru lesare proposed: log ica l  product  and syntact i c  re la t ion .3.2 Complex Concepts-BThis concept i s  usua l ly  represented  by a s imple word andi s  cons idered to cons is t  of severa l  e lementary  ad jec t ive  con-cepts .
No genera l  ru le  can be found to connect  e lementary  ad-Jec t ive  concepts .
Semantic contents  of the concepts are c lass -i f i ed  in to  such categor ies  as l ingu is t i c  ac t iv?ty  and character .3.3 Der ivat ive  ConceptsSome concepts possess e funct ion  of der iv ing  s new con-cept by operat i~  o thers .
They have two morphemic s t rUct t t res ,p re f ix  ~ and ett~fix, which add cer ta in  i~ormet ion  to operands.For example, st~ffix " - ta rash~"  adds the meaning " indeed" toi t s  operand.
Such der ivat ive  in fo rmat ion  i s  ca tegor i zed  in tofive classes.- 211  -4.
ClassificationThere are approximately 530 adjectives considered suffic-ient for daily Japanese.
We actually classified their con-cepts, n~nbering about 630, according to types and categoriesproposed in Sec.2 and 3.
They were well classified into thosetypes and categories.
In the classification of simple concepts,"standardconcepte" were chosen from among similar concepts,amounting to approximately 270.
They might be considered"primitives" in the sense that every other adjective conceptcan be derived from them by some rule.5.

Sentence Production from Picture PatternsSystem SUPP, which accepts moving picture patterns, in-terprets the meaning of changes in them, infers about simil-arity among changes, end describes the results in Japaneseand English sentences, was constructed as an application of- 212  -the  conceptua l  taxonomy of verbs .
SUPPwas improved to  in ter -p re t  phys ica l  a t t r ibutes  of p io tnre  pat terns .
Four teen  s tan-dard concepts  were chosen fo r  th i s  improvement.
