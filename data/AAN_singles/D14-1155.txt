KangComputer ScienceStony Brook University{rbanerjee, songfeng, junkang}@cs.stonybrook.eduYejin ChoiComputer Science & EngineeringUniversity of Washingtonyejin@cs.washington.eduAbstractIn this paper, we explore the use of keyboardstrokes as a means to access the real-time writ-ing process of online authors, analogously toprosody in speech analysis, in the context ofdeception detection.
We show that differencesin keystroke patterns like editing maneuversand duration of pauses can help distinguish be-tween truthful and deceptive writing.
Empiri-cal results show that incorporating keystroke-based features lead to improved performancein deception detection in two different do-mains: online reviews and essays.1 IntroductionDue to the practical importance of detecting deceit, in-terest in it is ancient, appearing in papyrus dated backto 900 B.C.
(Trovillo, 1939).
In more recent years, sev-eral studies have shown that the deceiver often exhibitsbehavior that belies the content of communication, thusproviding cues of deception to an observer.
These in-clude linguistic (e.g., Newman et al.
(2003), Hancocket al.
(2004)) as well as paralinguistic (e.g., Ekman etal.
(1991), DePaulo et al.
(2003)) cues.
Recognizingdeception, however, remains a hard task for humans,who perform only marginally better than chance (Bondand DePaulo, 2006; Ott et al., 2011).Recent studies suggest that computers can be sur-prisingly effective in this task, albeit in limited domainssuch as product reviews.
Prior research has employedlexico-syntactic patterns (Ott et al., 2011; Feng et al.,2012) as well as online user behavior (Fei et al., 2013;Mukherjee et al., 2013).
In this paper, we study theeffect of keystroke patterns for deception detection indigital communications, which might be helpful in un-derstanding the psychology of deception and help to-ward trustful online communities.
This allows us to in-vestigate differences in the writing and revisional pro-cesses of truthful and fake writers.
Our work thusshares intuition with HCI research linking keystrokeanalysis to cognitive processes (Vizer et al., 2009; Eppet al., 2011) and psychology research connecting cog-nitive differences to deception (Ekman, 2003; Vrij etal., 2006).Recent research has shown that lying generally im-poses a cognitive burden (e.g., McCornack (1997), Vrijet al.
(2006)) which increases in real-time scenar-ios (Ekman, 2003).
Cognitive burden has been knownto produce differences in keytroke features (Vizer etal., 2009; Epp et al., 2011).
Previous research has not,however, directly investigated any quantitative connec-tion between keystroke patterns and deceptive writing.In this paper, we posit that cognitive burdens indeception may lead to measurable characteristics inkeystroke patterns.
Our contributions are as follows:(1) introducing keystroke logs as an extended linguis-tic signal capturing the real-time writing process (anal-ogous to prosody in speech analysis) by measuring thewriting rate, pauses and revision rate.
(2) showingtheir empirical value in deception detection, (3) provid-ing novel domain-specific insights into deceptive writ-ing, and (4) releasing a new corpus of deception writ-ings in new domains.12 Related WorkPrior research has focused mainly on using keystroketraits as a behvioral biometric.
Forsen et al.
(1977)first demonstrated that users can be distinguished by theway they type their names.
Subsequent work showedthat typing patterns are unique to individuals (Leggettand Williams, 1988), and can be used for authentica-tion (Cho et al., 2000; Bergadano et al., 2002) and in-trusion detection (Killourhy and Maxion, 2009).Keystroke pauses have been linked to linguistic pat-terns in discourse (e.g.
Matsuhashi (1981), van Hell etal.
(2008)) and regarded as indications of cognitive bur-den (e.g., Johansson (2009), Zulkifli (2013)).
In this pa-per, we present the first empirical study that quantita-tively measures the deception cues in real-time writingprocess as manifested in keystroke logs.3 Data CollectionAs discussed by Gokhman et al.
(2012), the crowd-sourcing approach to soliciting deceptive content sim-ulates the real world of online deceptive content cre-ators.
We collected the data via Amazon MechanicalTurk.2Turkers were led to a separate website wherekeylogging was enabled, and asked to write truthfuland deceptive texts (?
100 words) on one of three top-1Available at http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/?junkang/keystroke/2https://www.mturk.com/mturk1469ArrowKey Del MouseUp0510GayMarriageGunControlRestaurantGayMarriageGunControlRestaurantGayMarriageGunControlRestaurantFrequencyof editing keystrokesDeceptive TruthfulFigure 1: Number of keystrokes corresponding to the threetypes of edit patterns (E3): (a) use of arrow keys, (b) deletion(Delete and Backspace) and (c) text selection with mouse.ics: restaurant review, gay marriage and gun control.Each Turker was required to agree to their typing be-ing logged.
Since copy/paste operations defeat our pur-pose of studying keystrokes in the typing process, theywere disabled.
This restriction also acts as a hindranceto plagiarism.
All texts were reviewed manually, andthose not meeting the requirements (due to the beingtoo short, plagiarized content, etc.)
were disregarded.Writing task design: The task was designed suchthat each Turker wrote a pair of texts, one truthful andone deceptive, on the same topic.
For restaurant re-views, they were asked to write a truthful review ofa restaurant they liked, and a deceptive review of arestaurant they have never been to or did not like.
Forthe other two topics ?
?gun control?
and ?gay marriage??
we asked their opinion: support, neutral, or against.Then, they were asked to write a truthful and a decep-tive essay articulating, respectively, their actual opin-ion and its opposite.3The tasks further were dividedinto two ?flows?
: writing the truthful text before the de-ceptive one, and vice versa.
Each Turker was assignedonly one flow, and was not allowed to participate in theother.
After completing this, each Turker was asked tocopy their own typing, i.e., re-type the two texts.Finally, in order to get an idea of the cognitive bur-den associated with truthful and deceptive writing, weasked the Turkers which task was easier for them.
Ofthe 196 participants, 152 answered ?truthful?, 40 an-swered ?deceptive?
and only 4 opted for ?not sure?.What are logged: We deployed a keylogger to cap-ture the mouse and keyboard events in the ?text area?.The events KeyUp, KeyDown and MouseUp, along withthe keycode and timestamp were logged.4For the threetopics restaurant review, gay marriage and gun controlwe obtained 1000, 800 and 800 texts, respectively.In the remainder of this paper, kdnand kupdenotethe KeyDown and KeyUp events for a key k. For any3To prevent a change in opinion depending on task avail-ability, Turkers were redirected to other tasks if their opinionwas neutral, or if we had enough essays of their opinion.4Printable (e.g., alphanumeric characters) as well as non-printable keystrokes like (e.g., ?Backspace?
), are logged.Document Sentence Word Key Press1.52.02.51.52.02.5First?onlyFirst+SecondGayMarriageGunControlRestaurantGayMarriageGunControlRestaurantGayMarriageGunControlRestaurantGayMarriageGunControlRestaurantTime taken(rel.to copy task)Deceptive TruthfulFigure 2: Average normalized timespan ??

(e).4 Feature DesignKeystroke logging enables the study of two types of in-formation that go beyond conventional linguistic anal-ysis.
First, it captures editing processes (e.g., deletions,insertions made by changing cursor position, etc.
).Second, it reveals the temporal aspect of text generation(e.g., duration, latency).
Our exploration of these fea-tures and their application in deception detection is mo-tivated by the similarities between text and speech gen-eration.
Editing patterns, for instance, can be viewed asattempts to veil incoherence in deceptive writing andtemporal patterns like latency or pause can be treatedas analogous to disfluency.Different people, of course, have varying typingskills, and some may type faster than others.
In or-der to control for this variation, we normalize all eventtimespans ?
(e) with respect to the corresponding eventtimespan in the copy task:??
(e) = ?(e)/?
(ecopy).4.1 Editing PatternsIn this work, we treat keys that are used only for edit-ing as different from others.
Text editing is done byemploying a small subset of available keys: deletionkeys (?Backspace?
and ?Delete?
), arrow keys (?, ?,?
and ?)
and by using the mouse for text selection(i.e., the ?MouseUp?
event).
The three types of editingkeystrokes are collectively denoted byE3= ?|DEL| , |MSELECT| , |ARROW|?where(i) |DEL| = number of deletion keystrokes(ii) |MSELECT| = number of ?MouseUp?
events, and(iii) |ARROW| = number of arrow keystrokesThe editing differences between truthful and deceptivewriting across all three topics are shown in Fig.
1.4.2 Temporal AspectsEach event is logged with a keycode and a timestamp.In order to study the temporal aspects of digital writ-ing, we calculate the timespan of different linguistic1470Topic Features FlowFirst + Second First-onlyRestaurantsBoW 73.9 78.8BoW + T674.3 79.1BoW + T6+ E374.6 80.3?Gun Control(Support)BoW 86.5 80.0BoW + T686.8 82.5?BoW + T6+ E388.0?83.5?Gun Control(Oppose)BoW 88.5 88.0BoW + T689.8 87.5BoW + T6+ E390.8?89.1Gay Marriage(Support)BoW 92.5 92.0BoW + T693.8 92.5BoW + T6+ E394.3?92.0Gay Marriage(Oppose)BoW 84.5 86.5BoW + T685.0 87.0BoW + T6+ E385.3 86.8Table 1: SVM classifier performance for truthful vs. de-ceptive writing.

Further, we separately inspect the timespansof different parts of speech, function words and con-tent words.
In addition to event timespans, intervalsbetween successive events (e.g., inter-word and inter-sentence pauses) and pauses preceding or succeedingand event (e.g., time interval before and after a functionword) are measured as well.5 Experimental ResultsThis section describes our experimental setup andpresents insights based on the obtained results.
Allclassification experiments use 5-fold cross validationwith 80/20 division for training and testing.
In additionto experimenting on the entire dataset, we also sepa-rately analyze the texts written first (of the two texts ineach ?flow?).
This additional step is taken in order toeliminate the possibility of a text being primed by itspreceding text.Deception cues in keystroke patterns: To empiri-cally check whether keystroke features can help distin-guish between truthful and deceptive writing, we de-sign binary SVM classifiers.5Unigrams with tf-idfencoding is used as the baseline.
The average baselineaccuracy across all topics is 82.58% when consideringboth texts of a flow, and 83.62% when considering onlythe first text of each flow.
The better performance in thelatter possibly indicates that the second text of a flowexhibits some amount of lexical priming with the first.The high accuracy of the baseline is not surprising.Previous work by Ott et al.
(2011) reported similar per-5We use the LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) package.??

The focus of our workis to explore the completely new feature space of ty-pographic patterns in deception detection.
We drawmotivation from parallels between the text generationand speech generation processes.
Prosodic conceptssuch as speed, disfluency and coherence can be real-ized in typographic behavior by analyzing timestampof keystrokes, pauses and editing patterns, respectively.Based on the differences in the temporal aspects ofkeystrokes, we extract six timespan features to improvethis baseline.
This set, denoted by T6, comprises of(i)??
(D) = timespan of entire document(ii)??
(kprv+W) = average timespan of word plus pre-ceding keystroke(iii)??
(k) = average keystroke timespan(iv)??
(SP) = average timespan of spaces(v)??
(?SP) = average timespan of non whitesp-ace keystrokes(vi)??
(?W) = average interval between words.The improvements attained by adding T6to the base-line are shown in Table 1.
Adding the edit patterns (E3)(cf.
?
4.1) further improves the performance (with theexception of two cases) by 0.7?3.5%.Writing speed, pauses and revisions: To study thetemporal aspect of language units across all topics,we first consider all texts, and then restrict to onlythe first of each ?flow?.
The timespan measurementsare presented in Fig.
2, showing the average durationof typing documents, sentences, words and individualkeystrokes.
The timespans are measured as the inter-val between the first and the last keystrokes.
The sen-tence timespan, for instance, does not include the gapbetween a sentence end and the first keystroke markingthe beginning of the next.The sentence timespans for ?gay marriage?
and ?gun1471DT+TD120130140150160170All WordsFunction WordsContent WordsNouns Verbs AdjectivesAdverbsTimespan (ms) DeceptiveTruthful(a)DT+TD350400450500550Function WordsContent WordsNouns Verbs AdjectivesAdverbsTimespan (ms) DeceptiveTruthful(b)Figure 3: Event timespans in restaurant reviews: (a) language units, and (b) language units including their preceding kdn.control?
are lower in truthful writing, even though thedocument timespans are higher.
This difference impliesthat the writer is spending a longer period of time tothink before commencing the next sentence, but oncestarted, the actual typing proceeds rapidly.Apart from restaurant reviews, truthful writers havetyped slower.
This may be due to exercising better carewhile expressing their honest opinion.For restaurant reviews, the document, sentence andword timespans are significantly higher in deceptivewriting.
This, however, is not the case for documentsand words in the other two topics.
We conjecture thatthis is because deception is harder to write for prod-uct reviews, due to their dependence on factual details.Gun control and gay marriage, on the other hand, aretopics well discussed in media, and it is possible thatthe writers are aware of the arguments that go againsttheir personal belief.
The frequency of revisional oc-currences (i.e., keys used for editing) shown in Fig.
1,too, supports the thought that writing fake reviews maybe harder than adopting a fake stance on well-knownissues.
Deceptive reviews exhibit a higher number ofrevisions than truthful ones, but essays show the oppo-site trend.
Our findings align with previous studies (Ottet al., 2011) which showed that deception cues are do-main dependent.Writing speed variations over word categories:Next, we investigate whether there is any quantitativedifference in the writing rate over different words withrespect to the deceptive and truthful intent of the author.In an attempt to understand this, we analyze wordswhich show the highest timespan difference betweendeceptive and truthful writings.Table 2 presents words in the restaurant reviewtopic for which deceptive writers took a lot longerthan truthful writers, and vice versa.
Some word cat-egories exhibit common trends across all three top-ics.
Highly subjective words, for instance (e.g., ?love?,?best?, ?great?)
are words over which truthful writersspent more time.Deceptive and truthful texts differ in the typing rateof first- and second-person pronouns.
Deceptive re-views reveal more time spent in using 2nd-person pro-nouns, as shown by ?you?
and ?your?.
This findingthrows some light on how people perceive text cues.Toma and Hancock (2012) showed that readers per-form poorly at deception detection because they rely onunrelated text cues such as 2nd-person pronouns.
Ouranalysis indicates that people associate the use of 2nd-person pronouns more with deception not only whilereading, but while writing as well.Deceptive reviews also exhibit longer time spans for1st-person pronouns (e.g., ?we?, ?me?
), which havebeen known to be useful in deception detection (New-man et al., 2003; Ott et al., 2011).
Newman et al.
(2003) attributed the less frequent usage of 1st-personpronouns to psychological distancing.
The longer timetaken by deceptive writers in our data is a possible signof increased cognitive burden when the writer is unableto maintain the psychological distance.
Deceptive re-viewers also paused a lot more around relative clauses,e.g., ?if?, ?when?, and ?which?.In essays, however, the difference in timespans of1st-person and 2nd-person pronouns as well as thetimespan difference in relative clauses were insignifi-cant (< 50ms).A broader picture of the temporal difference in usingdifferent types of words is presented in Fig.
3, whichshows deceptive reviewers spending less time on ad-verbs as compared to truthful writers, but more time onnouns, verbs, adjectives, function words and contentwords.
They also exhibited significantly longer pausesbefore nouns, verbs and function words.6 ConclusionIn this paper, we investigated the use of typographicstyle in deception detection and presented distinct tem-poral and revisional aspects of keystroke patterns thatimprove the characterization of deceptive writing.
Ourstudy provides novel empirically supported insightsinto the writing and editing processes of truthful anddeceptive writers.
It also presents the first applicationof keylogger data used to distinguish between true andfake texts, and opens up a new range of questions tobetter understand what affects these different keystrokepatterns and what they exhibit.
It also suggests newpossibilities for making use of keystroke informationas an extended linguistic signal to accompany writings.AcknowledgementsThis research is supported in part by gift from Google.1472ReferencesFrancesco Bergadano, Daniele Gunetti, and Claudia Pi-cardi.
