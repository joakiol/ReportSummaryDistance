Automatic Construction of an English-Chinese Bilingual FrameNetChen, Benfeng and Pascale FungHuman Language Technology Center,Department of Electrical& Electronic Engineering,University of Science and Technology (HKUST),Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong{bfchen,pascale}@ee.ust.hkAbstractWe propose a method of automatically con-structing an English-Chinese bilingual Fra-meNet where the English FrameNet lexicalentries are linked to the appropriate Chineseword senses.
This resource can be used in ma-chine translation and cross-lingual IR systems.We coerce the English FrameNet into Chineseusing a bilingual lexicon, frame context inFrameNet and taxonomy structure in HowNet.Our approach does not require any manualmapping between FrameNet and HowNetsemantic roles.
Evaluation results show thatwe achieve a promising 82% average F-measure for the most ambiguous lexicalentries.1 IntroductionSince the early 90?s, automatic alignment of bilingualdocuments and sentences based on lexical and syntacticinformation has been a major focus of the statisticalNLP community as their results are a valuable resourcefor statistical machine translation, cross-lingual questionanswering, and other bilingual or cross-lingual tasks.Recently, there has been an increasing trend of usingsemantic information for these tasks spurred by theavailability of various ontology databases such asWordNet, FrameNet, PropBank, etc.
Among these, theBerkeley FrameNet database is a semantic lexical re-source consisting of frame-semantic descriptions ofmore than 7000 English lexical items, together withexample sentences annotated with semantic roles (Bakeret al, 1998).
The current version of FrameNet has beenapplied successfully to English question answering sys-tems (Gildea, 2002).
However, the manual developmentof FrameNet in other languages has been on a smallscale (e.g.
German, Spanish, Japanese) or unfinished(e.g.
Chinese).
Since manually annotation is rather timeconsuming, the main objective of our work is to auto-matically create multilingual FrameNet to enable se-mantic analysis in multiple languages rather than inEnglish.
Another objective is to quantify the mappingbetween semantic structures across language pairs forstatistical NLP systems.
Our basic idea is to coerce theEnglish FrameNet into another language using existingsemantic resources and a bilingual lexicon.
Our initialtarget language is Chinese.
However, we expect that ourtechnique is applicable to other languages as well.
Thereare two Chinese semantic resources available today--Cilin (tong2yi4ci2ci2lin2) (Mei et al, 1982) andHowNet (Dong and Dong, 2000).
Much like WordNet,Cilin is a thesaurus with a hierarchical structure of wordclusters, but it does not describe any semantic relation-ship between words and categories.
HowNet, on theother hand, is an ontology with a graph structure of in-ter-concept relations and inter-attribute relations.
Inaddition, HowNet has been widely used in resolvingNLP problems, such as word sense disambiguation(Dang et al, 2002) and machine translation (Dorr et al,2002).
For our work, we choose to align HowNet con-cepts to lexical entries in FrameNet in order to constructthe English-Chinese bilingual FrameNet.
(Dorr et al, 2002) describes a technique for the con-struction of a Chinese-English verb lexicon based onHowNet and an English verb database called the LCSVerb Database (LVD).
They created links between Chi-nese concepts in HowNet and English verb classes inLVD using both statistics and a manually constructed?seed mapping?
of thematic classes between HowNetand LVD.
Ngai et al (2002) employed a word-vectorbased approach to create the alignment between Word-Net and HowNet classes without any manual annotation.In this paper, we present a fully automatic approach tocreate links between FrameNet semantic frames andHowNet concepts.
We also plan to release an on-linedemonstration for the community to access the bilingualFrameNet we built.2 FrameNet and HowNetFrameNet and HowNet are ontologies with differentstructures and different semantic role/relation defini-tions.
FrameNet is a collection of lexical entriesgrouped by frame semantics.
Each lexical entry repre-sents an individual word sense, and is associated withsemantic roles and some annotated sentences.
Lexicalentries with the same semantic roles are grouped into a?frame?
and the semantic roles are called ?frame ele-ments?.
For example:Frame: Cause_harmFrame Elements: agent, body_part, cause, event, in-strument, iterations, purpose, reason, result, victim?..Lexical Entries in ?cause_harm?
Frame:bash.v, batter.v, bayonet.v, beat.v, belt.v, bludgeon.v,boil.v, break.v, bruise.v, buffet.v, burn.v,?.An annotated sentence of lexical entry ?beat.v?
:[agent I] lay down on him and beat [victim at him][means with my fists].HowNet is a Chinese ontology with a graph structure ofword senses called ?concepts?, and each concept con-tains 7 fields including lexical entries in Chinese, Eng-lish gloss, POS tags for the word in Chinese and English,and a definition of the concept including its categoryand semantic relations (Dong and Dong, 2000).
Forexample, one translation for ?beat.v?
is ?:NO.
= 17645W_C =?G_C =VE_C =~??~??~??~???~??~??~??W_E=attackG_E=VE_E=DEF=fight|?
?Whereas HowNet concepts correspond roughly to Fra-meNet lexical entries, its semantic relations do not cor-respond directly to FrameNet semantic roles.3 Construction of the English-Chinese Bi-lingual FrameNet(Dorr et al 2002) uses a manual seed mapping of se-mantic roles between FrameNet and LVD.
In this paper,we propose a method of automatically linking the Eng-lish FrameNet lexical entries to HowNet concepts, re-sulting in a bilingual FrameNet.
We make use of twobilingual English-Chinese lexicons, as well as HowNetand FrameNet.
In the following sections 3.1 to 3.3, weuse an example FrameNet lexical entry ?beat.v?
in the?cause_harm?
frame to illustrate the main steps of ouralgorithm in Figure 1.For each lexical entry l in FrameNetFind translations T1 of l in HowNet translations.Find translations T2 of l in LDC dictionary.Combine the T1 and T2 together as T. T= T1?T2Link l to all HowNet concepts LC whose W_C fieldis in T. LC= {c|c.W_C ?

The algorithm.3.1 Baseline mapping based on bilingual lexiconWe use the bilingual lexicon from HowNet and LDCdictionary to first create all possible mappings betweenFrameNet lexical entries and HowNet concepts whosepart-of-speech (POS) tags are the same.
Here we as-sume that syntactic classification for the majority ofFrameNet lexical entries (i.e.
verbs and adjectives) aresemantically motivated and are mostly preserved acrossdifferent languages.
For example ?beat?
can be trans-lated into {?, ?, ?
?, ?
?, ?
?, ?
?, ?, ???}
in HowNet and {?, ?
?, ?, ?
?, ??}
inthe LDC English-Chinese dictionary.
?beat.v?
is thenlinked to all HowNet concepts whose Chineseword/phrase is one of the translations and the part ofspeech is verb ?v?.
Figure 2 shows some examples ofHowNet concepts that are linked to ?beat.v?.Figure 2.
Partial initial alignment of ?beat.v?
toHowNet concepts with 144 candidate links3.2 Disambiguation by semantic contexts in bothlanguagesAt this stage, each FrameNet lexical entry has links tomultiple HowNet concepts and categories.
For example,?beat.v?
in ?cause_harm?
frame is linked to ???
inboth the ?beat?
category and the ?associate?
category(as in???
?/make a phone call?).
We need to choosethe correct HowNet concept (word sense).
Many wordsense disambiguation algorithms use contextual wordsin a sentence as disambiguating features.
In this work,we make use of contextual lexical entries from the samesemantic frame, as illustrated below:To disambiguate between the above two candidate cate-gories, we make use of the other lexical entries in?cause_harm?, such as ??
?, and their linked categoriesin HowNet, such as ?beat?
again.
Each target HowNetcategory receives a vote from the candidate links.
In ourexample, ?beat?
receives two votes (from ???
and from???
), and ?associate?
only one (from ???).
We choosethe HowNet category with the most votes and its con-stituent concepts to be the valid word sense links to thesource FrameNet lexical entry.
Consequently, ?beat.v?in ?cause_harm?
is linked to all HowNet concepts thatare translations of ?beat?
which are verbs, and whichalso belong to the HowNet category ?beat?
(vs.
?associ-ate?
).Figure 3.
Disambiguating HowNet candidates for?beat.v?
with 42 candidate linksIn our example, Figure 3 shows the top 14 examples ofHowNet concepts belonging to two HowNet catego-ries??beat?
and ?damage?
that are linked to the?cause_harm?
frame in FrameNet.
Only the concepts inthe top N categories are considered as correctly linkedto the lexical entries in the ?cause_harm?
frame.
Weheuristically chose N to be three in our algorithm.3.3 Compensating links by HowNet taxonomy struc-tureUsing frame context alone in the above step can effec-tively prune out incorrect links, but it also prunes somecorrect links whose HowNet categories are not in thetop three categories but are similar to them.
In this nextstep, we aim to recover this kind of pruned links.
Weintroduce the category similarity score, which is basedon the HowNet taxonomy distance (Liu and Li, 2002):Sim(category1,category2) =+d?
?Where d is the path length from category1 to category2in the taxonomy.
?
is an adjusting parameter, whichcontrols the curvature of the similarity score.
We set?=1.6 in our work following the experiment results in(Liu and Li, 2002).
If the similarity of category p andone of the top three categories is higher than a thresholdt, the category p is also considered as a valid categoryfor the frame.In our example, some valid categories, such as ?firing|???
is not selected in the previous step even though itis related to the ?cause_harm?
frame.
Based on theHowNet taxonomy, the similarity score between ?firing|???
and ?beat|??
is 1.0, which we consider as high.Hence, ?firing|???
is also chosen as a valid categoryand the concepts in this category are linked to the?beat.v?
lexical entry in the ?cause_harm?
frame.
How-ever, using taxonomy distance can cause erros such as?
in the ?weave?
category to be aligned to ?beat.v?
inthe ?cause_harm?
frame.Figure 4.

To show thelower bound of the system performance, we chose sixFrameNet lexical entries with the most links to HowNetconcepts as the test set.
Since each link is a word sense,these lexical entries have the most ambiguous transla-tions.
Such lexical entries also turned out to be mostlyverbs.
Since the number of lexical entries in a FrameNetparent frame (i.e.
frame size) is an important factor inthe disambiguation step, we analyze our results by dis-tinguishing between ?small frame?s (a frame with lessthan 5 lexical entries) and ?large frame?s.
24% of theframes are ?small frames?.

Our evaluationshows that our method has achieved an 82% average F-measure in aligning the most ambiguous FrameNet lexi-cal entries to HowNet concepts.
This paper describesthe first stage in our project towards creating a bi-lingual English-Chinese FrameNet, by aligning lexicalentries between FrameNet and HowNet.
The next step isto automatically extract semantically annotated Chinesesentences based on the annotated English sentences inFrameNet, the aligned FrameNet lexical entries, andbilingual corpora.
We expect the final bilingual Frame-Net will provide a valuable resource for multi-lingual orcross-lingual natural language processing.AcknowledgmentThis work is partly supported by CERG#HKUST6213/02E of the Hong Kong Research GrantsCouncil (RGC).ReferencesCollin F.
