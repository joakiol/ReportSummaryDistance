PakhomovCollege of PharmacyUniversity of MinnesotaMinneapolis, MN 55455AbstractUMLS::Similarity is freely available opensource software that allows a user to mea-sure the semantic similarity or relatedness ofbiomedical terms found in the Unified Medi-cal Language System (UMLS).
It is written inPerl and can be used via a command line in-terface, an API, or a Web interface.1 IntroductionUMLS::Similarity1 implements a number of seman-tic similarity and relatedness measures that are basedon the structure and content of the Unified MedicalLanguage System.
The UMLS is a data warehousethat provides a unified view of many medical termi-nologies, ontologies and other lexical resources, andis also freely available from the National Library ofMedicine.2Measures of semantic similarity quantify the de-gree to which two terms are similar based on theirproximity in an is-a hierarchy.
These measures areoften based on the distance between the two con-cepts and their common ancestor.
For example, lungdisease and Goodpasture?s Syndrome share the con-cept disease as a common ancestor.
Or in generalEnglish, scalpel and switchblade would be consid-ered very similar since both are nearby descendentsof the concept knife.However, concepts that are not technically similarcan still be very closely related.
For example, Good-pasture?s Syndrome and Doxycycline are not similar?Contact author : bthomson@umn.edu.1http://umls-similarity.sourceforge.net2http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/since they do not have a nearby common ancestor,but they are very closely related since Doxycyclineis a possible treatment for Goodpasture?s Syndrome.A more general example might be elbow and arm,while they are not similar, an elbow is a part-of anarm and is therefore very closely related.
Measuresof relatedness quantify these types of relationshipsby using information beyond that which is foundin an is-a hierarchy, which the UMLS contains inabundance.2 Related WorkMeasures of semantic similarity and relatednesshave been used in a number of different biomedi-cal and clinical applications.
Early work relied onthe Gene Ontology (GO)3, which is a hierarchy ofterms used to describe genomic information.
Forexample, (Lord et al 2003) measured the similar-ity of gene sequence data and used this in an appli-cation for conducting semantic searches of textualresources.
(Guo et al 2006) used semantic simi-larity measures to identify direct and indirect pro-tein interactions within human regulatory pathways.
(Ne?ve?ol et al 2006) used semantic similarity mea-sures based on MeSH (Medical Subject Headings)4to evaluate automatic indexing of biomedical arti-cles by measuring the similarity between their rec-ommended terms and the gold standard index terms.UMLS::Similarity was first released in 2009, andsince that time has been used in various differentapplications.
(Sahay and Ram, 2010) used it in a3http://www.geneontology.org/4http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh28health information search and recommendation sys-tem.
(Zhang et al 2011) used the measures toidentify redundancy within clinical records, while(Mathur and Dinakarpandian, 2011) used them tohelp identify similar diseases.
UMLS::Similarityhas also enabled the development and evaluationof new measures by allowing them to be comparedto existing methods, e.g., (Pivovarov and Elhadad,2012).
Finally, UMLS::Similarity can serve as abuilding block in other NLP systems, for exam-ple UMLS::SenseRelate (McInnes et al 2011) is aword sense disambiguation system for medical textbased on semantic similarity and relatedness.3 UMLS::SimilarityUMLS::Similarity is a descendent of Word-Net::Similarity (Pedersen et al 2004), whichimplements various measures of similarity andrelatedness for WordNet.5 However, the structure,nature, and size of the UMLS is quite different fromWordNet, and the adaptations from WordNet werenot always straightforward.
One very significantdifference, for example, is that the UMLS is storedin a MySQL database while WordNet has its owncustomized storage format.
As a result, the coreof UMLS::Similarity is different and offers agreat deal of functionality specific to the UMLS.Table 1 lists the measures currently provided inUMLS::Similarity (as of version 1.27).The Web interface provides a subset of the func-tionality offered by the API and command line inter-face, and allows a user to utilize UMLS::Similaritywithout requiring the installation of the UMLS(which is an admittedly time?consuming process).4 Unified Medical Language SystemThe UMLS is a data warehouse that includes over100 different biomedical and clinical data resources.One of the largest individual sources is the System-atized Nomenclature of Medicine?Clinical Terms(SNOMED CT), a comprehensive terminology cre-ated for the electronic exchange of clinical health in-formation.
Perhaps the most fine?grained source isthe Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), an on-tology created for biomedical and clinical research.One of the most popular sources is MeSH (MSH), a5http://wordnet.princeton.edu/Table 1: UMLS::Similarity MeasuresType Citation NameSimilarity(Rada et al 1989) path(Caviedes and Cimino, 2004) cdist(Wu and Palmer, 1994) wup(Leacock and Chodorow, 1998) lch(Nguyen and Al-Mubaid, 2006) nam(Zhong et al 2002) zhong(Resnik, 1995) res(Lin, 1998) lin(Jiang and Conrath, 1997) jcnRelatedness(Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) lesk(Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) vectorterminology that is used for indexing medical jour-nal articles in PubMed.These many different resources are semi-automatically combined into the Metathesaurus,which provides a unified view of nearly 3,000,000different concepts.
This is very important since thesame concept can exist in multiple different sources.For example, the concept Autonomic nerve exists inboth SNOMED CT and FMA.
The Metathesaurusassigns synonymous concepts from multiple sourcesa single Concept Unique Identifier (CUI).
Thusboth Autonomic nerve concepts in SNOMED CTand FMA are assigned the same CUI (C0206250).These shared CUIs essentially merge multiplesources into a single resource in the Metathesaurus.Some sources in the Metathesaurus contain addi-tional information about the concept such as syn-onyms, definitions,6 and related concepts.
Paren-t/child (PAR/CHD) and broader/narrower (RB/RN)are the main types of hierarchical relations betweenconcepts in the Metathesaurus.
Parent/child rela-tions are already defined in the sources before theyare integrated into the UMLS, whereas broader/-narrower relations are added by the UMLS edi-tors.
For example, Splanchnic nerve has an is-arelation with Autonomic nerve in FMA.
This re-lation is carried forward in the Metathesaurus bycreating a parent/child relation between the CUIsC0037991 [Splanchnic nerve] and C0206250 [Au-tonomic nerve].6However, not all concepts in the UMLS have a definition.29Table 2: Similarity scores for finger and armSource Relations CUIs path cdist wup lch nam zhong res lin jcnFMA PAR/CHD 82,071 0.14 0.14 0.69 1.84 0.15 0.06 0.82 0.34 0.35SNOMED CT PAR/CHD 321,357 0.20 0.20 0.73 2.45 0.15 0.16 2.16 0.62 0.48MSH PAR/CHD 26,685 0.25 0.25 0.76 2.30 0.18 0.19 2.03 0.68 0.555 Demonstration SystemThe UMLS::Similarity Web interface7 allows a userto enter two terms or UMLS CUIs as input in termboxes.
The user can choose to calculate similarity orrelatedness by clicking on the Calculate Similarityor Calculate Relatedness button.
The user can alsochoose which UMLS sources and relations shouldbe used in the calculation.
For example, if the termsfinger and arm are entered and the Compute Simi-larity button is pressed, the following is output:View D e f i n i t i o n sView S h o r t e s t Pa thR e s u l t s :The s i m i l a r i t y o f f i n g e r( C0016129 ) and arm ( C0446516 )u s i n g Pa th Length ( p a t h ) i s0 .
2 5 .Using :SAB : : i n c l u d e MSHREL : : i n c l u d e PAR/CHDThe Results show the terms and their assignedCUIs.
If a term has multiple possible CUIs associ-ated with it, UMLS::Similarity returns the CUI pairthat obtained the highest similarity score.
In thiscase, finger was assigned CUI C0016129 and armassigned CUI C0449516 and the resulting similarityscore for the path measure using the MeSH hierar-chy was 0.25.Additionally, the paths between the concepts andtheir definitions are shown.
The View Definitionsand View Shortest Path buttons show the definitionand shortest path between the concepts in a sepa-rate window.
In the example above, the shortest pathbetween finger (C0016129) and arm (C0446516) isC0016129 (Finger, NOS) => C0018563 (Hand,NOS) => C1140618 (Extremity, Upper) =>7http://atlas.ahc.umn.edu/C0446516 (Upper arm), and one of the definitionsshown for arm (C0446516) is The superior partof the upper extremity between the shoulder andthe elbow.SAB :: include and REL :: include are config-uration parameters that define the sources and rela-tions used to find the paths between the two CUIswhen measuring similarity.
In the example above,similarity was calculated using PAR/CHD relationsin the MeSH hierarchy.All similarity measures default to the use ofMeSH as the source (SAB) with PAR/CHD rela-tions.
While these are reasonable defaults, for manyuse cases these should be changed.
Table 2 showsthe similarity scores returned for each measure us-ing different sources.
It also shows the number ofCUIs connected via PAR/CHD relations per source.A similar view is displayed when pressing theCompute Relatedness button:View D e f i n i t i o n sView S h o r t e s t Pa thR e s u l t s :The r e l a t e d n e s s o f f i n g e r( C0016129 ) and arm ( C0446516 )u s i n g Vec to r Measure ( v e c t o r )i s 0 .

In this example,the definitions come from any source in the UMLSand include not only the definition of the concept but30Table 3: Relatedness scores for finger and armSource Relations lesk vectorUMLS ALLCUI/PAR/CHD/RB/RN10,607 0.55UMLS ALLCUI 39 0.05also the definition of its PAR/CHD and RB/RN rela-tions.
Table 3 shows the relatedness scores returnedfor each of the relatedness measures using just theconcept?s definition (CUI) from all of the sources inthe UMLS (UMLS ALL) and when the definitionsare extended to include the definitions of the con-cept?s PAR/CHD and RB/RN relations.6 AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National Insti-tute of Health, National Library of Medicine Grant#R01LM009623-01.
