Embedding DRT in a Situation Theoretic FrmneworkAlan W BlackDept of Artificial Intelligence, University of Edinburgh,80 South Bridge, Edinburgh EII1 tHN, UK.awb@ed,  ac ,  ukAbst ractThis paper proposes the use of situation theory as abasic semantic formalism for defining general seman-tic theories.
ASTL, a computational situation theoreticlanguage, is described which goes some way to offeringsuch a system.
After a general description of DiscourseRepresentation Theory an encoding of DRT in ASTL isgiven.
Advantages and disadvantages of this methodare then discussed.Topie: computational formalisms in semantics and dis-courseIntroductionTbe pnrpose of this paper is to show how a compu-tational anguage based on situation theory can beused as a basic formalism ill which genera\] semantictheories can be implemented.
There are many dif-ferent semantic theories which, because of their dif-ferent notations, are difficult to compare.
A generallanguage which allows those theories to be imple-mented within it would offer an envirolnnent wheresimilar semantic theories could be more easily eval-uated.Situation Theory (ST) has been developed overthe last ten years \[2\].
Much work has been done inboth tlle formal aspects of situation theory and itsuse in natural anguage semantics (situation seman-tics), however so far little work has been dram ill itscomputational aspects.
It is the eventual goal oftile work presented here to show how situation the-ory can be used computational ly and how a com-putational situation theoretic language call providean enviromnent ill which different semantic theoriescall I)e easily compared.Because there are so many variants of ST wemust define our own here.
The language ASTL \[3\]has been defined.
Althongb it uses surprisinglyfew features of situation theory, it seems power-ful enough to act as a basic language for seman-tics.
It has been considered that somc extensionto "classical" feature structures be made and usethose to encode semantic forms.
Features systemsaugmented with set vahms, eyclicity and other ex-tensions may be powerful enough but the methoddescribed here takes an existing semantic theoryand refines it rather than building a new one.This paper is ba.sically split into two sections.Tlw first discusses how ST can be used in a compu-tational system, and introduces the language ASTL.The second half of this paper discusses DiscourseRepresentation Theory (DRT) as a theory in itselfand shows how it can be encoded with ASTL.ST and ComputationThe view according to situation theory is that partsof the "world" can be described as situations.
Sit-uations support facts.
Facts can be true, false, orundefined in some situation.
A fact's truth valuemay be different in different situations.
Situationsare tirst class objects in the theory, and hence theycan be used as arguments to facts so that rela-tions can be defined between situations.
Situationsare useful in translations for naked infinitives (e.g.
"see") Situations make ST different from moreconventional logical theories although there havebeen proposals to add situation-like objects to moreclassical theories like Montagne grammar  \[8\].As well as situations and partiality, situationtheory offers many other iutensional objects, in-cluding abstractions, types, and parameters (par-tially determined objects).
These form a rich for-realism for describing semantic phenomena.
How-ever these features alone do not constitute a com-putational system, with tile addition of constraintsand rules of inference we call have the basis fora computatimlal  system.
The idea of a computa-tional situation theoretic language has been con-sidercd elsewhere.
Most notable is the languagePRosv\[' \[9\] which offers a Prolog-like languagebased on situation theory rather than first orderlogic.
Other systems (e.g.
\[5\]) allow the representa-tion of situations etc.
within some other formalism(e.g.
feature structures) but do not use situationtheory itself as the basis for the language.ASTLASTL is a language based on situation theory.
Ittakes a very conscrvative view of situation theory,admitt ing only some basic parts.
Although ASTLmay need to be extended later, it already can beused to describe simple versions of semautic theo-ries (such ms situation semantics and DRT).
Ratherthan use, or extend, PROSlT it was decided to de-velop a new language.
ASTL includes stone built-ill support for natural language parsing based ontile ideas of Situation Theoretic Grammar  \[4\] whilePRoslrr is designed more for knowledge representa-tion than direct language processing.ASTL allows the following basic terms:I nd iv idua ls  : e.g.

In this notation we write situationsits boxes with their names m a top left inset withfacts written (in a more conventional predicate ar-gmnent  form) inside the box.Using the work of Cooper \[d\] we can processlanguage in a situation theoretic way.
SituationTheoretic Grammar  takes the view that utterancescan be represented by situations.
For example~m3 j"}Immko"-=~ | cat(gIT123,ProperNotm)/ use.of (SIT 123 ,"llartako")That  is, the use of the phrase "llanako" gives riseto a situation that supports the facts that it (thesituation) is a ProperNoun and it is a use of theword "Hanako".
We call these utterance situaiions.As an utterance happens at a part icular t ime andlocation this fact should also be recorded in thesituation.
In ASTL this temporal  aspect is built-in to the language.
A special form of constraint,grammar rules, can Ire used to constrain utterancesituations~ (-;eneral constraints apply to any formof situation (utterance or otherwise) while gram-mar  rules only apply to utterance situations.

DRT \[7\] ota~rs a represen-tat, ion lot discourses.
A discourse rcprcsenlalionstructure ( I )RS) is dctined at each stage in a dis-course describing the cllrrellt state of the analys/8.A I)RS consists of two parts; a set of domain mark-rr.s, whicll can be bound to objects introduced intothe current discourse, and a set of conditions onthese markers.
I) ltSs are typically written as boxeswith the markers in the top part and conditions be-low.
For example a I)RS for the utterance "a man81liftS" iSX=an (X ) l_ =' 72 \]The following description of I )RT in ASTL is basedon lhe I )HT definition in \[6\].
First we need a syn-tactic backbone to be able to discuss the construc-ti(m of a I)RS for a discourse.

That  is an ASTL I)RS will betruc Ior some situation (i.e.
a model) if there existsan anchoring for the parameters  in it which makeit a lype of the model-situation.
A special defini-tion will be needed for tile condition every  (andpossil)ly others if extensions to basic DI( I '  are in-ehMed).
It may be better to think of the situationnellie also as a parameter  which gets anchored Iothe model-sitnation.
Hut as the semantics of ASTLrelates situations names to situations (i.e.
two sit-m~t.ion nanles can denote the same situation) flmreis still a level of indirection.DHSs arc objects which are related to utteranee situations.
They are not themselves repre-sentations of the utterances but representations ofwhal tile utterances describe.Thread ingAn iml>ortant aspect of I )RT is how a I)RS is con-structed from a discourse.
Here (and in \[6\]) we usetile technique of threading.
Tile general idea is thata DH.S gets passed through a discoarse being addedto as the discourse l)rogresses.hi this description, a discourse consists of aset of utterance situations which call In' viewedt im)ugh a number of different structural relations,The tirsl is through tile relation daughter  whichdefines tile syntactic structure of lhe discourse asdefined by the grammar  rules ( immediate doini-nance and linear precedence).
Secondly the threadrdal.ion defines an ordering of tile ntlerance situ-al iens used in the generation of the l)RSs.
I,asllythere are two relations, range  and body lined illdefining the logical structure of the discourse.The threading relation is a binary relation be-tween utterance situations.
We will say the firstargument  is threaded to tile second.
Each utterancesituation appears exactly once a,S the second argu-ment in tile th read  relation (i.e.
il.
has exactly oneincoming thread).
There is one exeeplion, a specials ituation called DStar t  which does not have an in-coming thread (it is used to represent he null con-text at the start of a discourse), bm does appearas all incoming thread for one or more utterancesituations.
There are no cycles m threadhlg butas we shall see there may be more than one linkedthread of utterances within a discourse.
The actualconstruction of the threading relations is discussedlater.Each utterance situation is related to two DRSs,through tim relations DRSIn and DRSOut.
A DRSInDRS is tim DRSOut DRS of the incoming thread.Tiffs constraint can be written in ASTL o~'-;*S : \ [S  !
S !
-<<DRSIn ,S , *DRS, I>>\ ]<= TS: \ [TS !
TS != <<thread ,*S l , *$ , l>>\ ] ,*SI :  \[S1 !
S1 != <<DRSBut,SI ,*DRS, I>>\]  .The relation between the two DRSs related to anutterance is also constrained, This  is a core partof DRT.
Basically the outgoing DRS contains thesame information as the mcnming DRS plus anyreformation the utterance adds to the discourse.
Inthe cruse of a proper noun utterance situation we cancapture this relation with the following constraint:*S : \ [S  !
S != <<DRSout,S,*DRSout: :*DRSlnType k\[D !
D !~ <<name,*X,*N,l>>\],l>>\]<=*S: \[S !
S != <<cat,S,ProperNotm,l>>S !~ <<uBe of,S,*N,l>>S != <<aem,S,*X,l>>S != <<DRSTn,S,*DRSin: :*DRSInType,l>>\]hfformation is monotonical ly increasing m l)RSs aswe traverse along a thread.
We are not destruc-tively modifying a DRS as the discourse progressesbut constructing a new DRS which supports thesame conditions as the incoming DRS.
The con-straint above forms the outgoing I)RS from thetype (*DRSInType) of tile incoming one, which willcontain all the conditions of the incoming DRS,plus a new condition introducing the parameter  forthe I)roper noun and a condition on its name.We also have tile constraint hat any argumentor relation that appears in the conditions of a DRSmust  be related to some utterance situation by therelation sere previously ill that thread.
This  con-dition means that argnments  are threaded beforepredicates.
For example both the subject NP andobject NP of a simple sentence will be threaded l)e-fore the VP.
In eontrmst in \[6\] tile VP  comes beforea object NP which means a I)RS is created withan argmnent  in a condition which is not yet deter-mined (i.e.
a free variable).The other structural relations are range  andbody  Each determiner utterance situation appearsin exactly one range-re lat ion and exactly one body-relat ion.
Tile second argument  to these relationsare utterance situations that do not appear as firstarguments in any threading relation (i.c.
they areends of threads).

Tile se-mantics of an ASTL DRS, briefly described above,requires that it is possible to tell the properties ofevery object in the situation.
As situations are par-tial it may not be defined for everything whether itis a man or not, thus it is not possible to define "allmen."
(Note, lack of information does not implyfalsity.)
This is perhaps unfair to consider this asa problem as m the standard efinitions of DR?I' itis required that the model be complete (all prop-ertics are defined on all objects) - so it seems noworse to require this of the situation in which weare finding tile trnth conditions of a 1)RS.
lloweverwe could include further definitions for the everyrelation and require that there be some resourcesituation that identifies actual objects that fall inits scope.
This technique has been used by \[4\].There is the question of compositionality.
Itcould be said that the threading relations are onlypartially determined eompositionally.
But thisseems exactly what the theory states and the in-tuition behind it.
We cannot define a I)RS for anoun phrase nnless we know what context ile NPis ill. All that can be determined is partial defini-tion with conditions on the context.An important aspect of DRT is that there is aleft to right dependency on DRSs.
This does notnecessarily mean that parsing must be left to right,though normally it will be.
A definition of I)RTshould inelnde this dependency and not rely on howa implementation happens to order processing.
TileASTL definition does include a left to right depen-dency, without specifying a processing order on theinference mechanisn\].SummaryThis paper has introduced tile notion of using sit-uation theory a.s a basic formalism in which othersemantic theories might be defined.
A computa-tional situation theoretic language called ASTL isdiscussed.
Sitnatlon theory is suitable as basis for ametatheory because a representation f situationsallows the representation of higher order objectsnecessary for describing other semantic theories.
Apossible translation of I)I~T in ASTL is given.
Thecoverage is that of \[6\].This translation is interesting because first itshows that situation theory is not some opposingsemantic theory but that it can be used ill dis-cussing other theories, tIowever perhaps it is notsurprising that a language such as ASTL is power-ful enough to give this translation.
A feature sys-tem, with sets (or some definition), cycles and con-straints is close to what ASTL is, but it is interestingthat these properties can be found as the basis ill acurrent semantic theory without introducing a newtheory.
Finally a situation theoretic description ofDRT allows extensions of DRT to use the proper-ties of situation theory.
Situations which are use-ful ill describing various natural anguage semanticphenomena (e.g.
naked infinitives) are now readilyavailable to be included in exteusious of DRT.Acknowledgements: This work w~s supported by anSEltC studentship award number 89313458.
