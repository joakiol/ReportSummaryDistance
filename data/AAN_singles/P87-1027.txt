Department of Linguistics, University of LancasterBailrigg, Lancaster LA1 4YT, EnglandAbstractWe describe a methodology and associated softwaresystem for the construction of a large lexicon froman existing machine-readable (published) dictionary.The lexicon serves as a component of an English mor-phological and syntactic analyesr and contains entrieswith grammatical definitions compatible with the wordand sentence grammar employed by the analyser.
Wedescribe a software system with two integrated com-ponents.
One of these is capable of extracting syn-tactically rich, theory-neutral lexical templates froma suitable machine-readabh source.
The second sup-ports interactive and semi-automatic generation andtesting of target lexical entries in order to derive a size-able, accurate and consistent lexicon from the sourcedictionary which contains partial (and occasionally in-accurate) information.
Finally, we evaluate the utilityof the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary EnglgsA asa suitable source dictionary for the target lexicon.1 IntroductionWithin the larger framework of the Alvey Programmeof advanced information technology -- a research anddevelopment initiative set up in the UK to promotecollaborative research projects ~imed at several en-abling key technologies -- a coordinated e~ort to builda natural language toolkit for the use by the wider aca-demic and industrial community is being carried outjointly by groups at the Universities of Cambridge,Lancaster and Edinburgh.The goal of these three closely related projects is toproduce directly compatible rule systems and associ-ated software, capable of functioning together as an in-tegrated system for morphological and syntactic pars-ing of texts.
The projects aim to deliver, respectively,a 8entente grammar of English together with a toord listindexed to the grammar, a combined inflectional andderlvational morphological na/y~er and dictionary 8~s-tent, and a parser for the grammatical formalism used.The work is being carried out within the theoreticalframework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar(Gszdar et ai., 1985), but many of the mechanismswould be usable without a theoretical commitment toGPSG.
It is envisaged that the complete integratedtoolkit will be used by a number of research and de-velopment groups, as a base component for a range ofapplications.
The potential requirements of a diverseuser community motivate, in particular, the need fora morphological and syntactic anaiyser with wide cov-erage of English grammar and vocabulary.
Briscoe etal.
(1987) describes the sentence grammar formalismand current coverage of the English grammar in detail.Russell et al (1986) describes the morphological anal-yser and dictionary system.
Further relevant detailsof both projects are provided in section 2.As part of the grammar project, in tandem withthe development of the grammar proper, work is un-derway to develop a sizeable word list which will be in-tegrated with an existing lexicon of about 4000 words,hand crafted by the morphology project.
The cover-age of this word list and its compatibility with thesentence grammar, word grammar and existing lexi-con k critical for the complete analysis ystem.
Theword list need only contain base and irregular entries,as productive inflectional nd derivational variants areanalysed at run-time on the basis of the word gram-mar.
Therefore, when the word list is integrated withthe existing lexicon and dictionary system it will forma dynamic system for word analysis, and not just arepository of word forms used for simple lookup.An additional constraint on the content of the tar-get word Ust comes from the fact that even thoughthere k no provision for the analysis ystem to handlesemantics, there is still the need to provide a minimal,theoretically neutral extension to the grammar ulesand lexical entry format to allow subsequent integra-tion of a semantic omponent: hus information con-ceruing eg.
the predicate-argument structure of verbsand their logical types must be made available in thelexical entries.The question tl~en arises of how to develop such adetailed and substantial word list.
Our approach asbeen to make use of the machine-readable source of apublished dictionary, namely the Longr~sn Dictionaryof Contsraporarll Engtish (henceforth LDOCE)  (Proc-ter, 1978).
Apart from the obvious motivation of at-tempting to derive a large list of words from a comput-erised source, LDOCE is particularly relevant to thisproject since it o~ers, among other things, through ahighly elaborate and semi-formal system of 9ram~zarcodes, detailed information about the grammatical be-haviour of individual words.
We have mounted thedictionary on-line and, following its conversion into aflexible lexical knowledge base (as described in Bogu-raev et M., 1987), a range of experiments have sincebeen carried out with the aim of establishing LDOCE'sappropriateness to the task of deriving a word listwith associated grammatical definitions indexed to theanalyser grammar.
Section 3 below describes the syn-tactic level information available in, and extractablefrom, LDOCE and summarises the description of anoperational program used to derive such information.The attempt to use semi-form~Aised, and occasion-ally inaccurate, information for constructing a largecomputerised lexicon raises a number of practical prob-lems.
In order to make maximal use of the rich syn-193tactic data in the source machine-readable dictionary(MR/)), we have designed a lexicon development sys-tem which embodies a methodology for a semi-automa-tic interactive cycle of lexical entry generation andtesting.
This is described in section 4.2 The target lexiconGiven the goal of the toolkit projects to provide a led-con capable of supporting morphological nd syntacticanalysis of English, there is a precise definition of theinformation required in lexical entries.
Both the gram-mar and morphology projects have adopted a featuresystem based largely on that described in Gasdar et al(1985).
A lexical entry will contain features relevanteither to the word grammar or sentence grammar, orboth, represented as a list of feature name / featurevalue pairs.
In Figure I we show a fragment from thehand crafted lexicon developed as part of the morphol-ogy project (Russell et al, 1986).
Here we concentrateon the feature-value s ts carrying the syntactic infor-mation; the complete ntries have also semantic anduser fields, which are of no relevance to this paper.bel ieve(V *.

Grover et al (1987) contains a completedescription of the features used in the sentence grzm-mar; P,.itchie et ~l.
(1987) offers an equally completedescription of the morphological nd syntactic featuresrelevant o the operations of the word grammar.
Forthe purposes of this paper, we present a brief overviewof the sentence grammar feature system.With exception of the features N, V and BAR,used to define the major categories of the grammar,most features can be classlfied in terms of the cate-gories they apply to.
For each major category typethere is a set of head features which must appear onall instances of that category type, regardless of theirBAR feature value.
Further features must (or may)be associated only with some instances of a categorytype, depending on the value of their BAR feature(or, on occasions, some other feature).
The sets ofhead features for the four major categories axe:VERBALHEAD {PRD FIN AUX VFORAI PAST AGR}NOMINALHEAD {PLU POSS CASE PN COUNTPRD PRO PART NFORM PER}PREPHEAD {PFORM LOC PRD}ADJHEAD {AFORM PRD QUA ADV NUM NEGPAI~I ~ AGR DEF}.The features appearing on certain categories in ad-dition to the sets defined above are COMP, IN'V, NEGand SUBCAT which are relevant to verbal categories;SPEC, DEF and SUBCAT, applicable to nominal cat-egories; GERUND, POSS and SUBCAT for preposi-tional categories; and SUBCAT alone for adjectivalcategories.
With exception of SUBCAT, which mustbe specified for all lexical entries, and the respectivehead features ets, the only other features requiredby the lexical nodes in the grammar are NEG,and DEF.
Features like SLASH, WH, UB and EVER,which are required by the grammar to implement theGPSG treatment of certain linguistic phenomena, reof no relevance to this paper.The feature set in Figure 2 overleaf defines the in-formation about lexical items which will be requiredto construct a lexicon compatible both in form andcontent with the rest of the analysis ystem.
Some ofthese features, (such as FIX) are specific to boundmorphemes(these include, for example, entries foruztive", ~ng ~ or "nessJ).
Other features (for instanceWH, REFL) are specific to closed class vocabularyitems, such as interrogative, relative and reflexive pro-nouns.
Bound morphemes and closed class vocabularyare exhaustively defined in the hand crafted lexicon.However, this lexicon inevitably only contains a fewexamples of the much larger open class vocabulary?
Inorder for the word and sentence grammars to func-tion correctly, open class vocabulary must be definedIn terms of the feature set illustrated overleaf (Figure 2a).The features relevant to the open class vocabularycan be divided into those which are predictable onthe basis of the part of speech of the item involved,those which follow from the inflectional or deriv~tionalmorphological rules incorporated into the system, ~ndthose which rely on more specific information thanpart of speech, but nevertheless must be specified foreach individual entry.
For example the values for thefeatures N, V and BAR in the sample entries abovefollow from the part of speech of ~oelieve = .
The valuesof PLU and PER are predictable on the basis of theword grammar ules and need not be independentlyspecified for each entry.
On the other hand, the valuesof SUBCAT and LAT are not predictable from eitherpart of speech or general morphological information.We concentrate on this last class of features whichmust be specified on an entry-by-entry basis in anylexicon which is going to be adequate for supportingthe analysis ystem.
Within this class of features ome(eg.
LAT, AT or BARE..ADJ) are only relevant to theword grammar.
It is clear that those features that arederivable from the part of speech information are re-coverable from virtually any/vfl~).
However, most (ifnot all) of the features in the third class above are notrecoverable from the majority of ~\[\]~.Ds.
As indicatedabove, LDOCE appears to be an exception to thisgenerai\]sation, because it employs a system of gram-matical tagging of major syntactic lasses, offering de-tailed information about subcategorisation, morpho-logical irregularity and broad syntactico-semantic in-formation.194BAR {-10 12}V {-+}N {-+}PRD {- .4-}qUA {- +}ADV {- ?

TheLongman lexicographers have developed a representa-tional system which is capable of describing compactlya variety of data relevant to the task of building a lex-icon with grammatical definitions; in particular, theyare capable of denoting distinctions between count andma~ nouns ( 'do~ vs. Sdesire'), predicative, postpos-itive and attributive adjectives ('asleep" vs. "elect"vs. "jocular~), noun and adject|ve complementation(~ondness', Tact')  and, most importantly, verb com-plementation and valency.8.1 The  Longman grammar  cod ing  sys temGrammar codes typically contain a capital etter, fol-lowed by a number and, occasionally, a small letter,for example \[TSa\] or \[V3\].
The capital etters encodeinformation "about the way a word works in a sen-tence or about the position it can fill" (Procter, 1978:xxviii); the numbers "give information about the waythe rest of a phrase or clause is made up in relation tothe word described" (ibid.).
For example, "T" denotesa transitive verb with one object, while "5" specifiesthat what follows the verb must be a that clause.
(Thesmall letters, eg.
"a" in the case above, provide infor-mation related to the status of various complementis-era, adverbs and prepositions in compound verb con-structions: here it indicates that the complementiseris optional.)
As another example, '~r3" introduces averb followed by one object and a verb form (V) whichmust be an infinitive with to (3).In addition, codes can be qualified with words orphrases which provide further information concerningthe linguistic ontext in which the described item islikely, and able, to occur; for example \[Dl(to)\] or \[L(tobe)l\].
Sets of codes, separated by semicolons, are as-sociated with individual word senses in the lex/cal en-try for a particular item, as the entry for ~feel", withextracts from its printed form shown in Figure 3, il-lnstrates.
These sets are el/ded and abbreviated inthe code field associated with the word sense to savespace in the dictionary.
Partial codes sharing an ini-tial letter can be separated by commas, for example\[Tl,Sa\].
Word qualifiers relating to a complete se-quence of codes can occur at the end of a code field,delimited by a colon, for example \[TI;I0: (DOWN)\].fao l  I ?

These include, for example,misplaced commas or colon del/miters and occasionalmigration of other lex/cal information (e.g.
usage la-bels) into the grammar code fields.This type of error and inconsistency arises becausegrammar codes are constructed by hand and no au-tomatic checking procedure is attempted (l~fichiels,1982).
They provide much of the motivation for our in-teractive approach to lexicon development, since anyattempt at batch processing without extensive userintervention would inevitably result in an incomuleteand inaccurate l xicon.195$.2 Mak ing  use of the gr -mmar  codesThe program which transforms the LDOCE grammarcodes into lexical entries utilisable by the analyser firstproduces a relatively theory-neutral representation ofthe lexical entry for a particular word.
As an illnstm-tion of the process of transforming a dictionary entryinto a lexical template we show below the mappingof the third verb sense of %elieve" below into a lex-ical entry incorporating information about the gram-matical category, syntactic subcategorisstion framesand semantic type of verb -- for example a label like(Type 20Ra ls ing)  indicates that under the givensense the verb is a two-place predicate and that if itoccurs with a syntactic direct object, this will functionas the logical subject of the predicate complement.be- l ievo  ... v 1 \[I0J to  have a f i rm re l ig iousfa i th  2 iT1\] to  cons ider  to  be  t rue  or  hon-est:  to be| ices someoaelto helices someoae'sreports 8 \ [TSa ,b ;VS;X  (to be) I ,  ( to be} 7\]to  hold  ss  an  op in ion;  suppose:  I helices heha* come.

the predicate-argument structure and the logical type) of, especially,verbs.
In the main, the code numbers determine aunique subcategorisation.
However, such semantic in-formation is not explicitly encoded in the LDOCEgrammar codes, so we have adopted an approach at-tempting to deduce a semantic classification of theparticular sense of the verb under consideration onthe basis of the complete set of codes assigned to thatsense.
In any subcategorisatlon frame which involves apredicate complement there will be a non-transparentrelationship between the superficial syntactic form andthe underlying logical relations in the sentence.
Inthese situations the parser can use the semantic typeof the verb to compute this relationship.
Expandingon a suggestion of Nfichieis (1982), we classify verbsas subject equi (SEqui), object equi (OEqul), sub-ject raising (SRals ing)  or object raising (ORuls ing)for each sense which has a predicate complement codeassociated with it.
These terms, which derive fromTransformational Grammar, are used as convenientlabels for what we regard as a semantic distinction.The five rules which are applied to the grammarcodes associated with a verb sense are ordered in a waywhich reflects the filtering of the verb sense througha series of syntactic tests.
Verb senses with an lit+IS\]code are classified as SRais ing.
Next, verb senseswhich contain a \[V\] or IX\] code and one of \[D5\], \[DSa\],\[De\] or \[D6a\] codes are classified as OEqui.
Then,verb senses which contain a IV\] or \[X l code and a ITS\]or \[TSa\] code in the associated grammar code field,(but none of the D codes mentioned above), are clas-sified as ORalstng.
Verb senses with a \[VJ or \[X(tobe)\] code, (but no \[T5\] or \[TSa\] codes), are classified.as OEquL Finally, verb senses containing a \[T2\], \[T3\]or iT4\] code, or an \[I2\], \[13\] or \[I4\] code are classifiedas SEquL Below we give examples of each type; for adetailed escription see Boguraev and Briscoe (1987).happen(S) \[WvS;/Zd-IS\](Type I SRaising)warn(1) \[Wv4;I0;TI:( o~ aca/m~),Sa;D 5a;V3\](Type 3 o~ui)usume(1) \[Wv4;Tl,Sa,b',X(to be)l,7\](Type 20Raising)decline(S) \[TI,S;10\](Type 2 SZqul)Figure 5: The four semantic types of verbA generic lexical template of the form illustrated inFigure 4 can clearly be directly mapped into a featureduster within the features and feature set declarationsused by the dictionary and grammar projects.
A coln-parison of the existing entries for ~oelieve ~ in the handcrafted lexicon (Figure 1) and the third word sense for~believe m extracted from LDOCE demonstrates thatmuch of the information available from LDOCE is ofdirect utility - -  for example the SUBCAT values canbe derived by an analysis of the Takes values andthe ORaie ing  logical type specification above.
In-deed, we have demonstrated the feasibility (Alshawiet al, 1985) of driving a parsing system directly fromthe information av~lable in LDOCE by constructingdictionary entries for the PATR-H system (Shieber,1984).It is also clear, however, that it is unrealistic toexpect hat on the basis of only the information avail-able in the machine-readable source we will be ableto derive a fully fleshed out lexical entry, capable offulfilling all the run-time requirements of the analy-sis system that the lexicon under construction here isintended for.3.3 Ut i l i ty  o f  LDOCEfo r  automat ic  lex icon  generat ionFirstly, the information recoverable from LDOCE whichis of direct utility is not totally reliable.
Errors ofomission and assignment occur in the dictionaryfor example, the entry for aconsider" (Figure B) lacksa code allowing it to function in frames with sententialcomplement (eg.
I consider that it is a great honour tobe here).
The entry for %xpect", on the other hand,spuriously separates two very similar word senses (1and 5), assigning them different grammar codes.196?onslde,  ... 2 \[WvS, X (to be) 1,7; V3 lto regard as; think of in a stated way:I conelder pol ?/oo~ (= I regard youa fool).

.Figure 8: Errors of omission sad assignment in LDOCEErrors like these nitimately cause the transforma-tion program to fail in the mapping of grammar codesto feature clusters.
We have limited our use of LDOCEto verb entries because these appear to be coded mostcarefully.
However, the techniques outlined here axeequally applicable to other open class items.Furthermore, since some of the information re-qured is only recoverable on the basis of a comparisonof codes within a word sense specified in the sourcedictionary, additional errors can be introduced.
Forexample, we assign ORats lng to verbs which con-taln subcategorlsatlon frzmes for sentential comple-ment, a noun phrase object and an infinitive comple-ment within the same sense.
However, thls rule breaksdown in the case of an entry such as %cknowledge ",where the two codes corresponding todifferent subcat-egorisation frames are split between two (spuriouslyseparated) word senses (Figure 6), and consequentlyincorrectly assigns OEqu i  to this verb.
The rule con-sequently breaks down and aconsider~ is incorrectlyassigned the logical type of an Equi  verb.We have tested the classification of verbs into se-mantic types using a verb list of 139 pre-classifieditems available in various published sources (eg.
Stock-well etal .
,  1973).
The overall error rate in the pro-cess of grammar code analysis and transformation was14~; however, the rules discussed above classify verbsinto SRals ing,  SEqu i  and OEqu l  very successfully.The main source of error comes from the mieclasslfi-cation of ORais ing into OEqut  verbs.
This was con-firmed by another test, involving applying the rules fordetermining the semantic types of verbs over the 7,965verb entries in LDOCE.
The resulting lists, assign-ing the 719 verb senses which have the potential forpredicate complementation i to appropriate seman-tic classes, confirm that errors in our procedure aremostly localised to the (mls)application f the ORals-lng rule.
Arguably, these errors ~o  derive mostlyfrom errors in the dictionary, rather than a defect ofthe rule; see Boguraev and Briscoe (1987) for furtherdiscussion.Secondly, the analysis ystem requires informationwhich is simply not encoded in the LDOCE entries;for example, the morphological features AT, LAT andBARE_ADJ are not there.
This type of feature is crit-ical to the analysis of derivxtional variants, and suchinformation is necessary for the correct application ofthe word grammar.
Otherwise many morphologicallyproductive, but nonexistant, lexical forms will be de-fined and be potentially analysable by the lexicon sys-tem.
Therefore, lexical templates are not converteddirectly to target lexical entries, but form the input tosecond phase in which errors and inadequacies in thesource ~ are corrected.4 A. methodology and a systemfor lexicon developmentIn order to provide for fast, simple, but accurate devel-opment of a lexicon for the analysis ystem we have im-plemented a software nvironment which is integratedwith the transformation program described above andwhich ofers an integrated morphological generationpackage and editing facilities for the semi-antomaticproduction of the target lexicon.
The system is de-signed on the a~umption that no machine-readabledictionary can provide a complete, consistent, and to-tally accurate source of lexical information.
Therefore,rather than batch process the MRD source, the lexicondevelopment software is based around the concept ofsemi-automatic and rapid construction of entries, in-volving the continuous intervention of the end user,typically a linguist / lexicographer.In the course of an interactive cycle of develop-ment, a number of entries are hypothesised and auto-matically generated from x single base form.
The fam-ily of related surface forms is output by the morpholog-ical gensr~tor,  which employs the same word grammarused for inflectional and derivxtlonal morphology bythe analysis ystem and creates new entries by a~idinga/fixes to the base form in legitimate ways.
The gen-eration and refinement of new entries is based on re-peated application of the morphological generator tosuitable base forms, followed by user intervention i -volving either rejecting, or minimally editing, the sur-face forms proposed by the system.
Below we sketcha typical pattern of use.If the user asks the system to create an entry for'rbelieve', the transformation program described insection 3.2 (see Figure 4) will create an entry whichcontains all the syntactic information specified in Fig-ure 1.
In addition, many surface forms with associatedgrammatical definitions will be generated automati-cally:cobclievc overbclieve 8ubbelieve believeddisbelieve postbclieve unbelieyc bolieveointerbelievo prebelieve underbelieve believermisbelteve rebeltevo believable beltewlngoutbeliove s~4believe believal believesFigure 7: Derivational variants of %elieve"The system generates these forms from the baseentry in batches and displays the results in syntacticframes associated with subcategorisatlon possibilities.Thees frames, which are used to tap the user's gram?maticality judgements, are as semantically 'bleached'197as possible, so that they will be as compatible as poe-sible with the semantic restrictions that verbs placeon their arguments.
Each possible SUBCAT featurevalue in the grammar is associated with such frames,for example:SFIN:0a:0E:77~r-  ... ~ t~ momma~  some~'.g7he~ C ... ~ t~r~ to be ?

27seg C ... "-I ~to  be ~pm~gemFigure 8: Syntactic subcategorisation framesInternally, frames are more complex than illus-trated above.
Surface phrasal forms with marked slotsin them are associated with more detailed feature spec-ifications of lexical categories which are compatiblewith the fully \]nstantiated lexical items allowed by thegrammar to fill the slots.
Such detailed frame speci-fications are automatical ly generated on the basis ofsyntactic analysis of sentences made up from the framephrase skeleton with valid lexical items substituted forthe blank slot filler.

For example, the user can reject Theyoeerbelieee that 8orneone is something completely, butThe v be\[ievem that someone is something is indicative ofan incorrect definition, rather than surface form.
Syn-tactic frames encoding other ' transformational '  possi-bilitlse are often associated with particular SUBCATvalues since these provide the user with more helpfuldata to accept or reject a particular assignment.
Thusfor example selecting between Ra is ing  and OEqu iverbs is made easier if the frames for \ [SUBCAT OR.\]are instantiated simultaneously:7~ ~ so, z~o,w to be ,o , ,a~,~ /per~ eomeo,~ to be eo,ne~n?77a~ ~ 0ave to be ~ Vm~,~ /7hey per~/e  t~ere to be ~ pro~nFigure 10: SUBCAT value selectionThe user has two broad options: to reject a set offrames and associated surface form outright or to editeither the surface form or definition associated witha set of frames.
Exercising the first option causes allinstances of the surface form and associated syntacticframes to be removed from the screen and from fur-ther consideration by the user.
However, this actionhas no effect on the eventual output of the system,so these morphologically productive but non-existentforms and definitions will still be implicit in the lex-icon and morphology component of the English anal-yser.
It is assumed that this overgeneration is harm-less though, because such forms will not occur in ac-tual input.Edit ing a surface form or associated efinition re-suite in a new (non-productive) entry which will formpart of the system's output to be included as an in-dependent irregular entry in the target lexicon.
If theuser edits a surface form, the edited version is substi-tuted in all the relevant syntactic frames.
Providedthe user is satisfied with the modified frames, a newentry is created with the new surface form, treated asan indivisible morpheme, and paired with the existingdefinition.
Similarly, if the user edits a definition as-sociated with a set of syntactic frames, a new set offrames will be constructed and if he or she is happywith these, a new entry will be created with existingsurface form and modified definition.
(The Englishanalyeer can be run in a mode where non-productiveseparate ntries are 'preferred' to productive ones.
)The user can modify both the surface form andthe associated efinition during one interaction with aparticular potential entry; for example, the definitionfor ~believal m contains both an incorrect surface formand definition for a nominal form of the base form~oeUeve =.
After the associated syntactic frames aredisplayed to the user, instead of rejecting the entireentry at this point, he or she can modify the surfaceform to create a new entry for ~oellef" - -  a processwhich results in the revised syntactic frames:T~ ~ev~be~evd eo.~o~ to be ao.~' .gFigure I1: Frame-based refinement of %el ief"198The user now has three options; rejecting the thirdsyntactic frame, or alternatively deleting the associ-ated sub-entry with a \ [SUBCAT OR\] feature defini-tion, followed by confirmation will result in the con-struction of a new entry for the lexicon.
The thirdoption, should the user decide that nominal formsnever take OR complements, is to edit the morpho-logical rules themselves.
This option is more radicaland would presumably only be exercised when the userwas certain about the linguistic data.The system described so far allows the semi-auto-matic, computer-aided production of base entries andirregular, non-productive derived entries on the ba.sis of selection and editing of candidate surface formsand definitions thrown up by the derivationai generA~tor.
However, this approach is only as good as theinitial base entry constructed from LDOCE.
If thebase entry is inadequate, the predictions produced bythe generator are likely to be inadequate too.
Thiswill result in too much editing for the system to bemuch help in the rapid production of a sizeable lexi-con.
Fortunately, the system of syntactic frames andediting facilities outlined above can also be used to re-fine base entries and make up for inadequacies in theLDOCE grammar code system (from the perspectiveof the target grammar).
For example, LDOCE en-codes trAusitivity adequately but does not representsystematically whether a particular transitive has apassive form.
In the target grammar, there are twoSUBCAT values NP and NOPASS which distinguishthese types of verb.
Therefore, all verbs with a tran-sitive LDOCE code are inserted into the two sets ofsyntactic frames hown below.
When these frames axeiustantiated with particular verbs rejection of one orother is enough to refine the LDOCE code to the ap-propriate SUBCAT value.
For example, the instanti-ated frames for "cost n are:liP:IOP~:Thelt C ... -l thatTheme ~e C ... "7 ~t&~nTho,s are co~ by themTA~ r" ... "~ t&U* Tha,s ~re C ... 3 b~ them, Thou ~e co*t bY themFigure 12: The SUBCAT / NOPASS distinctionThe fact that "cost" does not fit into the NP pawsive (second) frame, behaving in a way compatiblewith the NOPASS predictions, means it acquires aNOPASS SUBCAT value.
Since these frames will bedisplayed first and the operation changes the base en-try, subsequent forms and definitions generated by thesystem will be based on the new edited base entry.This example, also highlights one of the inher-ent problems in our approach to lexicon development.Syntactic frames are used in preference to direct pe-rusal of definitions in terms of feature lists to speed uplexicon development by tapping the user's grAmmati-cality judgements directly and to reduce the amountof editing and keyboard input.
They also provide theuser with a degree of insulation from the technicaldetails of the morphological nd syntactic formalism.However, semantically 'bleached' frames can lea~l toconfusion when they interact with word sense ambi-guity.
For example, aweigh ~ has two senses one ofwhich allows passive and one of which does not (com-pare The baby toaa toeighed by the doctor with * Tenpound6 tuaa t#eighed by the baby).Unfortunately, the syntactic frames given for NP /NOPASS axe not 'bleached' enough because they tendto select he sense of "weigh ~ which does Mlow passive.The example raises wider issues about the integrationof some treatment of word meaning with the produc-tion of such a lexicon.
These issues go beyond thispaper, but the problem illustrated emonstrates thatthe type of techniques we have described are heuris-tic aids rather than failsafe procedures for the rapidconstruction of a sizeable and accurate lexicon from smachine-readable dictionary of variable accuracy andconsistency.5 ConclusionPractical natural language applications require vocab-ularies substantially larger than those typically devel-oped for theoretical or demonstration purposes andhand crating these is often not feasible, and certainlynever desirable.
The ev-Muation of the LDOCE gram-mar coding system suggests that it is sufficiently de-tailed nd accurate (for verbs) to make the on-llne pro-duction of the syntactic component of lexical entriesboth viable and labour saving.
However, the less than100% accuracy of the code assignments in the sourcedictionary suggests that a system using the machine-readable version for lexicon development must embodya methodology allowing rapid, interactive and semi-automatic generation and testing of lexicM entries ona large scale.We have outlined a lexicon development environ-ment, which embodies a practical approach to usingan existing MRD for the construction of a substantialcomputerised lexicon.
The system splits the deriva~tion of target lexical entries into two phases; an au-tomatic transformation of the source data into a for-mMised lexical template containing as much relevantinformation as can be derived (directly or indirectly),followed by semi-automatic correction and refinementof this template into a set of base and irregular targetentries.6 AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by research grants (Num-bers GR/D/4217.7 and GR/D/05554) from the LrKScience and Engineering Research Council under theAlvey ProgrAmme.
