Jb l  I IUIX,IMasahlto RawamorISophia University,2 Kieicho, ChivodakuTokyo, JapanAbstractThis paper gives a formal theory of presupposition usingsituation semantics developed by Barwise and Perry, We willslightly modify Barwise and Perry's original theory of situationsemantics so that we can deal with non-monotonic reasoningswhich are very important for the formalization of presupposi-tion in natural language.
This aspect is closely related to theformalization of incomplete knowledge in art i f ic ia l  intelligence,1.
IntroductionIn constructing a natural language understanding systemwe face,serious problems in syntax, semantics and pragmatlcs,From a computational point of view, pragmatics especiallyposes the greatest problem.
At present there exists noappropriate theory of pragmatics for natural language.
A fewapproaches proposed so far seem to o f fer  linguistic or compu-tational diff icult ies in their foundation, for they never givea computational mechanism for pragmatics in an ef fect ive way.In understaqding the meaning of a natural language we useboth the knowledge for the language and the so-calledworld know~ Most of the inferences used in naturallanguage can be dependent upon the latter.
Many researchers,however, have ignored in their formalism this aspect of naturallanguage reasonings.We believe that a desirable formalism must include twoimportant devices: f i rst ly  a representation of world knowledge:secondly, an inference system involved in the world knowledge.The forme," has already been realized in many A\] systems, whilethe latter  cannot be found in most systems.
As for the latter,"although there are such non-classical systems as non-monotoniclogics and fuzzy logic, a more suitable inference system forincomplete knowledge is definitely in need.
And linguisticobservations have shown that traditional model-theoreticformalisms are inadequate in this respect.Presupposition is essential In understanding naturallanguage.
The possibility of suspending presuppositions of asentence shows that presupposition has lobe  undarstobd asan inference in an incompletely perceived world.
Hence con-structing a theory of natural language reasonings as presup.position calls for one" Incorporating non-monotonic reasonings,From such considerations we choose Situation Semantics(henceforth SS) developed by Barwise and Perry (1983) as abasis of our theory.
In SS the meaning of a sentence is repre-sented as a relation between the situations in which thesentence is uttered and the situations described by suchutterances.
We take presuppositions to be information aboutthe described situations consistently restricted by the utteredsituations.In section Z we review presupposition briefly.
The subsequentsections will provide a theoretical foundation for it on thebasis of 5S.2, PresuppositionBefore formalizing pr(~supposition, we shah consider theimportant question: "what is a presupposition?"
The answer tothis question Is the kev to the construction of a formal theoryof presupposition.We find in the literature- several definitions of presup-position.
For example, many philosophers and linguists assumethe definition generally represented as follows:(Def 1) A presupposes 8 i f f(i) A entails B00 -A entails BThis definition leads the undesired conclusion that B Is a+.autology.
Clearly an improved definl'tion is in order.Karttunen (1973) gives the following as an alternative:(IDef 2) A ~t ica l ly  presupposesB relative tq a set ofassumed facts C i f f  it is riot acceptable to utter A In thecontext C unless C entails B,This definition says that a presupposition is an entailmentof the sentence in a context.
Regretablv, nowever, there areno formal definitions for such terms as 'entails', ' relative to',174'context, in the above definition,Gazdar (1979),'on the other hand, gives the followingdefinition.
(Def 3) praBmatic presupposition is entailed bv thecontext in favour of the weaker requirement hat they beconsistent with the context.There he further gives the fallowing informal definitionsof essential terms in the above definit ion @s follows,(Def 3.1) A sentence A is entailed bv a set of sentence BJust in case A is true in every possible world in which allmembers of B are true.
(Def 3.2) A sentence A is consistent with a set ofsentences 8 just in case A is true tn some possible worldin which all members of B are true.Thus Gazdar's definition crucia}lv depends on the notion ofconsistency.Although llis definition seems to be more plausible than theother definitions based en entailments, as it enables us toaccommodate the so-called projection prob!em at ease, yet Itis not' entirely free from shortcomings,HIS theory is based on possible-world semantics, which isnot quite adequate as a natural language semantics.
TheInappropriateness of such a theory is discussed in BarwJse andPerry (1983), Akama (1986) in detail.
From a computational pointof view, especially many of its deficiencies can be stated, Tosay the least possible-world semantics seems to fail to dealwith partial information in an ef fect ive way, And in theoriesin this tradition only restr icted statements can be derivedfrom its model that is, accessibility relations af fect  logicalstructures in the model.
Moreover although unrealisticobjects may be possible in a model, they are not suitable fora computational paradigm.In computer science Mercer and Relter (1982) formulatedpresupposition, more or less In Gazdar's spirit, as an inferencegenerated from a pragmatic rule, namely, default rule.
Sincetheir formalism ts based on f i rst -order theory, similar short-comings as in the case of passible-world semantics can bepointed cut.
It is, however, interesting to notice its f lexlbi i i tyin the application to knowledge representation.To overcome the above mentioned diff icult ies in traditionaltheories, we introduces SS as an underlying theory for  presup-position below,3.
Formal Theory of PresuppositionWe are concerned in this section with formalizing thenotion of presupposition within the framework of SS.Our theory is a l i t t le  d i f ferent  than the version presentedIn Barwise and P(~rrv (1983) or Barwise (1985), for we Introducesome modifications in the theory so that we can accomodatepresupposition in natural language,More specifically, our formalism assumes a non-monotonicrelation between events called plausibility orderin9, as opposedto the monotonic 'persistence' relation assumed in Barwise andPerry (198\]).
As a consequence, our theory is not only capableof treating presupposition In an elegant way, but is able todeal with default and autoepistemic reasonings as well.3,1 Outline of Situation Semantics|n this section we review brief ly some basic points of SS.Here we mainly follow the formalism recently introduced inBarwise (1984, 1985) rather than the original one in Barwise andPerry (1983) since it  is simpler and more comprehensive.The most attract ive idea of SS is the shift of attentionfrom 'truth conditions to 'information conditions'.
$5 can besaid to be an attempt at explicating the nature of languagefocussing on the following two aspects:(1) under what conditions a sentence can be used toconvey information.
(2) what information the sentence conveys under thoseconditions.A situation S can contain information in v i r tue of  someconstraint  the holds between types of  situations.
We denotetypes of  situa.tions as S, S' .... We wr i te  s:S If s i tuat ion s isS, A type of s i tuat ion S is realized i f  there is a reals i tuat ion s such that, s:S, There are three categories ofobjects across situations: namely, individua.~ denoted as: a,b .

.
Correspondingto each category, there are purely abstract ,  sort  or dummy.ent i t ies  called indeterminates that  stand proxy for  genuineobjects.
We represent indeterminates by So, $b .

Anehorin 9 is a funct ion that  assigns individuals,relations, and locations to the indeterminates.For example, the fol lowing is a type of s i tuat ion wherea is in re lat ion R to be b: "S - ($s\]ln $s: at $1: R. a, b: 1\]where R, a, and b denote some respect ively  speci f ic  re lat ionand individual, and $s and $1 are indeteminates.Given an anchor that  assign 1' to $1, the fol lowing can bea real s i tuat ion where a and b are in the same re lat ion R:in s: at \]' : R, a,  b; 1.A Constraint is a re lat ion holding between types of situa-tion, S -> ~r, we read i t  as S involves S'.
In tu i t ive ly  this meansthat  i f  S is realized, that  is, there is a real s i tuat ion s:S,then there is a real s i tuat ion s' such that  s':S'.Given any constra int  and any anchor f fo r  some or all  ofthe parameters in S, the result  of  replacing the parameters byappropr iate values will give rise te an actual constraint .To wit, ifS~ S'is actual, then so isS(f )  ?
S ' ( f ) .We call the la t te r  an instance of  the former, t4ere we canextend the involves re lat ion to a three-place re lat ion asS # S'/Bwhhere B is the backcjround conditions on the s i tuat ions inwhich const ra in (between S and S' holds.Let R be n* l -p lace re lat ion taking n+l objects al  .

\ ] f  $an*l Js an environment constant, that  is, it Isf ixed in some way, then i t  only takes n objects and a t ruthvalue to determine the same proposit ion.In the above mentioned remark of  involves relat ion, Bcorresponds to an environment constant.
Parametric Informa-t ion is re lat ive to some assignment to parameters in a type ofs ituation.Barwise (19B~) uses the two dist inct  terms fo r  'meaning',namely, s i tuat ion meaning and s i tuat ion- type meanin 9, Theformer is used fo r  talk ing about the meaning of  part icu larsituation, while ti le la t te r  Is fo r  the meaning of  a certa in  tvPeof  s ituation.
We can ident l fv  s i tuat ion meaning with informa-tion, so a part icu lar  state of af fa i r s  has a s i tuat ion meaning.And understanding 4he s i tuat ion meaning of  par t icu lar  mentalstate requires an understanding of  the s i tuat ion- type meaningof that  type of  state, as i t  normally functions in the externall i fe  of  the agent, Here I f  we take into account a congnit ivestate o f  the agent we need two paral lel  sets of  constraints,one on some act iv i ty  A and the other  on cognit ive ac t iv i tyabout A.
'~,More formally, let  #S, #S' .

be types of  s i tuat ion of  themental state for a f ixed agent.
Also tile agent is able toconstruct  #0: #S ~ #S', Usually we assume the fol lowingdiagram of  constraints between mental s i tuat ions and situations,that is,S # S't#S ~ #S'Here we assume there exists a homomorphJsm F from acol lect ion of  types of  s i tuat ion to a col lect ion of corre-sponding types of  s i tuat ion of mental states, namely there isan F such that  F(s) - flS, This generates that  an agent canin terpret  real s i tuat ions in various ways.
Thus involve re lat ionrelat ion between real s ituations and mental si%uations can beregarded as an inverse of F, namelv F-'(#S) - S. According tothe above mentioned def init ions we can eostruct  some types ofs i tuat ion of  mental state in the e f fec t ive  way, I f  there is noagent, as is the case in a knowledge system, #S is consideredas se l f - re ferent ia l  statement on fie.
We think its foundationsare more or less cotrovers ia l ,\]n SS an inference is an ac t iv i ty  that attempts to use factsabout the world to ext rac t  addit ional information, informationimplicit in the facts,  A sound inference then is the appropr iatechain of  information.3,2.
Formalism of  Modified SSThere are two main features to be taken into account whenproviding an appropr iate def in i t ion for  presupposition innatural language, One thing is to accommodate a lack ofcomplete information.
The other  thing is to accommodate theagent's bel ief  context,  fhe former is called 'defaul t '  and thela t te r  autoepistemic' respect ively.
Although they appear tobe independent of  each other  in thei r  involvement in presup-position, our formalism is capable of dealing with both of  them.Our modif ication of  SS is mainly concerned with revisingthe involves re lat ion between situations.
As we said at theoutset of  this chapter, instead of  the part ia l  ordering ofinformation, namely, ~ .nccA~e assumed in the originalversion of Barwise and Perry (1983), we shah introduce theplausibi l i ty ordering, -(, sat is fy ing the fol lowing conditions:(1) A -{ B implies Ac_B (=_ is an ordinary monotonic relation),(Z) A ~ A ( re f lex iv i ty) ,(3) A -( B and B -( C impllies A -C C ( t rans i t iv i tv) ,Although the exact  nature of' the plausibi l i ty ordering is rathervague, its in tu i t ive  meaning is that  any information, whethercor rec t  or incor rect  in the actual,  is of  use in the model forSS.For instance, we presuppose b y__defau\]t in a certa incognit ive state towards the world.
Presuppositions are appro-pr iate interpretat ions  of  information depending on the agenteven i f  i t  includes both information and misinformation,We now revise the theory of  constraints on the basis ofthe plausible chain of information introduced above.We assume the fol lowing condit ions on the modified involvesrelat ion:(1) If B is f ixed, then i f  $1 $ S2/B and 62 ~ SS/Bthen $1 ~ SS/B,(2) I f  S ?
S'/B and B'"( B, where B' is co_ompatible with S,then S .~ S'/B'.
(\]) If S ~) S'/B and B'-( B, where B' is not compatible with S,then S e -S'/B'.
(4) I f  S ~ S'/B then S is c.ompatible with B, that  is, SUB iscoherent.
(5) If S ?
S-~/B and f is a coherent anchor for  some of  theparameters of  B. then S(f) ~ S'(f)/B(f).
(6) I f  S ~ S'/B where B has no parameters, and i f  B isrealized by some real situation, then S ~ S' is actual,(1) I f  S e S'/B and B- (  8', then S ~ S'/B' or S ~It is to be noticed that  condit ion (7) means that  certa inparametric constra ints  can a f fec t  a t ru th  condition as informa-tion increases.
In the original approach Jn SS i t  is nontr iv ia lto represent any nonmonotonicitv in the e f fec t ive  way.We now define presupposition in the framework of  SS asbelow:(Def ~) A ~ B in tile background condition C i f fA -) B/C and -A ,~ B/C Jr #An#B }~175A 4 -B/C i f  #A~#B =where A, B denote type of situation of the world and IIA,t/B, types of situation of the agent's mental statesrelative r.g A, B.In the definil;ion we of course assume the involve relationsatisfies'the above mentioned seven conditions.
And if thereis no agent in the krlowledge sVstem, #A is part of' A sinceany knowledge base is itself  coherent structure in the I~rutheondition.
In such a case presuppositions correspond to thedefault as loog as we adopt ordinary inference system.We can formalize va|-ious t~pes i l l  presuppositions bvmaking use el' this definition.
For example, this definitionpredicts we can do valid inference from rnJsinformation arid doinvalid inference from correct information.
The inferencescarried out by human being have manv demonstrai:ive charactersrelated to tbe cognitive processes of information o f  the world.Here we shall regard any information to be used bvtbe  agentas a presupposition in a certain context,I~.
