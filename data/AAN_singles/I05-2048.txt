Statistical Machine Translation Part I: Hands-On IntroductionStephan VOGELInterACT, LTICarnegie Mellon University407 South Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213stephan.vogel@cs.cmu.eduAbstractStatistical machine translation (SMT) iscurrently one of the hot spots in naturallanguage processing.
Over the last few yearsdramatic improvements have been made, and anumber of comparative evaluations have shown,that SMT gives competitive results to rule-basedtranslation systems, requiring significantly lessdevelopment time.
This is particularly importantwhen building translation systems for newlanguage pairs or new domains.This workshop is intended to give anintroduction to statistical machine translationwith a focus on practical considerations.Participants should be able, after attending thisworkshop, to set out building an SMT systemthemselves and achieving good baseline resultsin a short time.The tutorial will cover the basics of SMT:?
architecture of an SMT system?
word alignment models, esp.
IBM1 andHMM models?
phrase alignment, from Viterbi path anddirect phrase alignment models?
decoder, including recombination,pruning, n-best list generation?
integrating output from other MTengines (multi engine translation)?
data processing: checking, cleaning,normalizing the data?
evaluation, especially automaticevaluation (Bleu, NIST, ...), includingsignificance analysisTheory will be put into practice.
STTK, astatistical machine translation tool kit, will beintroduced and used to build a workingtranslation system.
STTK has been developed bythe presenter and co-workers over a number ofyears and is currently used as the basis ofCMU's SMT system.
It has also successfullybeen coupled with rule-based and examplebased machine translation modules to build amulti engine machine translation system.
Thesource code of the tool kit will be madeavailable.BiographyStephan Vogel is research scientist at theLanguage Technologies Institute, CarnegieMellon University.
He is also affiliated toInterACT, the International Center forAdvanced Communication Technologies, a jointcenter between the University of Karlsruhe,Germany, and Carnegie MellonUniversity.
After receiving a MSc in Physicsfrom Philips University of Marburg, and aMPhil in History and Philosophy of Sciencefrom the University of Cambridge, England, hedid his doctoral studies at the University ofAachen (RWTH), where he started to work onStatistical Machine Translation.
This remainedthe focus of his research.
Since he joined CMUin 2001 he built a SMT research team, whichnow consists of more then 10 PhD and Masterstudents, working on a number of text andspeech translation projects.275
