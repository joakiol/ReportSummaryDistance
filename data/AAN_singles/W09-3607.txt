Radev1,2, Pradeep Muthukrishnan1, Vahed Qazvinian11Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science2School of InformationUniversity of Michigan{radev,mpradeep,vahed}@umich.eduAbstractWe introduce the ACL Anthology Net-work (AAN), a manually curated net-worked database of citations,collaborations, and summaries in the fieldof Computational Linguistics.
We alsopresent a number of statistics about thenetwork including the most cited authors,the most central collaborators, as well asnetwork statistics about the paper citation,author citation, and author collaborationnetworks.1 IntroductionThe ACL Anthology is one of the mostsuccessful initiatives of the ACL.
It was in-itiated by Steven Bird and is now maintainedby Min Yen Kan.
It includes all papers pub-lished by ACL and related organizations aswell as the Computational Linguistics journalover a period of four decades.
It is availableat http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/ .One fundamental problem with the ACLAnthology, however, is the fact that it is justa collection of papers.
It doesn?t include anycitation information or any statistics about theproductivity of the various researchers whocontributed papers to it.
We embarked on anambitious initiative to manually annotate theentire Anthology in order to make it possibleto compute such statistics.In addition, we were able to use the anno-tated data for extracting citation summaries ofall papers in the collection and we also anno-tated each paper by the gender of the authors(and are currently in the process of doing si-milarly for their institutions) in the goal ofcreating multiple gold standard data sets fortraining automated systems for performingsuch tasks.2 CurationThe ACL Anthology includes 13,739 pa-pers (excluding book reviews and posters).Each of the papers was converted from pdf totext using an OCR tool (www.pdfbox.org).After this conversion, we extracted the refer-ences semi-automatically using string match-ing.
The above process outputs all thereferences as a single block so we then ma-nually inserted line breaks between refer-ences.
These references were then manuallymatched to other papers in the ACL Antholo-gy using a ?k-best?
(with k = 5) string match-ing algorithm built into a CGI interface.
Asnapshot of this interface is shown in Figure1.
The matched references were stored to-gether to produce the citation network.
Refer-ences to publications outside of the AANwere recorded but not included in the net-work.In order to fix the issue of wrong authornames and multiple author identities we hadto perform a lot of manual post-processing.The first names and the last names wereswapped for a lot of authors.
For example, theauthor name "Caroline Brun" was present as"Brun Caroline" in some of her papers.Another big source of error was the exclusionof middle names or initials in a number ofpapers.
For example, Julia Hirschberg hadtwo identities as "Julia Hirschberg" and "JuliaB.
Hirschberg".
There were a few spellingmistakes, like "Madeleine Bates" was miss-pelled as "Medeleine Bates".Finally, many papers included incorrecttitles in their citation sections.
Some used thewrong years and/or venues as well.54Figure 1: CGI interface used for matching new references to existing papersFigure 2: Snapshot of the different statistics computed for an author55Figure 3: Snapshot of the different statistics for a paper3 StatisticsUsing the metadata and the citations ex-tracted after curation, we have built three dif-ferent networks.The paper citation network is a directednetwork with each node representing a paperlabeled with an ACL ID number and theedges representing a citation within that paperto another paper represented by an ACL ID.The paper citation network consists of 13,739papers and 54,538 citations.The author citation network and the authorcollaboration network are additional networksderived from the paper citation network.
Inboth of these networks a node is created foreach unique author.
In the author citationnetwork an edge is an occurrence of an authorciting another author.
For example, if a paperwritten by Franz Josef Och cites a paper writ-ten by Joshua Goodman, then an edge iscreated between Franz Josef Och and JoshuaGoodman.
Self citations cause self loops inthe author citation network.
The author cita-tion network consists of 11,180 unique au-thors and 332,815 edges (196,905 edges ifduplicates are removed).In the author collaboration network, anedge is created for each collaboration.
Forexample, if a paper is written by Franz JosefOch and Hermann Ney, then an edge iscreated between the two authors.Table 1 shows some brief statistics aboutthe first two releases of the data set (2006 and2007).

They also re-port results from a regression analysis usingH-Index scores from different sources (AAN,Google Scholar) in an attempt to identifymulti-disciplinary authors.4 Sample rankingsThis section shows some of the rankingsthat were computed using AAN.57Rank Icit Title1 590 Building A Large AnnotatedCorpus Of English: The PennTreebank2 444 The Mathematics Of StatisticalMachine Translation: ParameterEstimation3 324 Attention Intentions And TheStructure Of Discourse4 271 A Maximum Entropy ApproachTo Natural Language Processing5 270  Bleu: A Method ForAutomatic Evaluation Of6 246  A Maximum-Entropy-InspiredParser7 230 A Stochastic Parts Program AndNoun Phrase Parser ForUnrestricted Text8 221 A Systematic Comparison OfVarious  Statistical Alignment9 211 A Maximum Entropy Model ForPart-Of-Speech Tagging10 211 Three Generative LexicalizedModels For Statistical ParsingTable 4: Papers with the most incomingcitations (icit)Rank PR Title1 1099.1 A Stochastic Parts ProgramAnd Noun Phrase Parser ForUnrestricted Text2 943.8 Finding Clauses In UnrestrictedText By Finitary AndStochastic Methods3 568.8 A Stochastic Approach ToParsing 4 543.1 A Statistical Approach ToMachine Translation5 414.1 Building A Large AnnotatedCorpus Of English: The PennTreebank6 364.9 The Mathematics Of StatisticalMachine Translation: ParameterEstimation7 362.2 The Contribution Of Parsing ToProsodic Phrasing In AnExperimentalText-To-Speech System8 301.6 Attention Intentions And TheStructure Of Discourse9 250.5 Bleu: A Method For AutomaticEvaluation Of MachineTranslation10 242.5 A Maximum Entropy ApproachTo Natural LanguageProcessingTable 5: Papers with highest PageRank(PR) scoresIt must be noted that the PageRank scoresare not accurate because of the lack of cita-tions outside AAN.

These sentences usually men-tion at least one of the cited paper?s contribu-tions.
We use AAN to extract the citationsummaries of all articles, and thus the citationsummary of P is a self-contained set and onlyincludes the citing sentences that appear inAAN papers.
Extraction is performed auto-matically using string-based heuristics bymatching the citation pattern, author namesand publication year, within the sentences.The following example shows the citationsummary extracted for ?Koo, Terry, Carreras,Xavier, Collins, Michael John, Simple Semi-supervised Dependency Parsing".
The cita-tion summary of (Koo et al, 2008) mentionsKCC08, dependency parsing, and the use ofword clustering in semi-supervised NLP.C08-1051 1 7:191 Furthermore, recent studies revealed that word clustering is useful for semi-supervised learn-ing in NLP (Miller et al, 2004; Li and McCallum, 2005; Kazama and Torisawa, 2008; Koo et al, 2008).D08-1042 2 78:214 There has been a lot of progress in learning dependency tree parsers (McDonald et al, 2005;Koo et al, 2008; Wang et al, 2008).W08-2102 3 194:209 The method shows improvements over the method described in (Koo et al, 2008), whichis a state-of-the-art second-order dependency parser similar to that of (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), suggestingthat the incorporation of constituent structure can improve dependency accuracy.W08-2102 4 32:209 The model also recovers dependencies with significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art dependency parsers such as (Koo et al, 2008; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).W08-2102 5 163:209 KCC08 unlabeled is from (Koo et al, 2008), a model that has previously been shown tohave higher accuracy than (McDonald and Pereira, 2006).W08-2102 6 164:209 KCC08 labeled is the labeled dependency parser from (Koo et al, 2008); here we onlyevaluate the unlabeled accuracy.Figure 5: Sample citation summary59Figure 6: Snapshot of the citation summary for a paperThe citation text that we have extracted foreach paper is a good resource to generatesummaries of the contributions of that paper.We have previously developed systems usingclustering the similarity networks to generateshort, and yet informative, summaries of in-dividual papers (Qazvinian and Radev 2008),and more general scientific topics, such asDependency Parsing, and Machine Transla-tion (Radev et al 2009) .7 Gender annotationWe have manually annotated the gender ofmost authors in AAN using the name of theauthor.
If the gender cannot be identifiedwithout any ambiguity using the name of theauthor, we resorted to finding the homepageof the author.
We have been able to annotate8,578 authors this way: 6,396 male and 2,182female.8 DownloadsThe following files can be downloaded:Text files of the paper: The raw text filesof the papers after converting them from pdfto text is available for all papers.
