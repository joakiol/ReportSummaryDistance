Although there are in-depthlinguistic descriptions of code-switchingacross different multilingual communica-tion settings, there is a need for au-tomatic prediction of code-switching inlarge datasets.
We use emoticons andmulti-word expressions as novel featuresto predict code-switching in a large onlinediscussion forum for the Turkish-Dutchimmigrant community in the Netherlands.Our results indicate that multi-word ex-pressions are powerful features to predictcode-switching.1 IntroductionMultilingualism is the norm rather than an ex-ception in face-to-face and online communica-tion for millions of speakers around the world(Auer and Wei, 2007).
50% of the EU popula-tion is bilingual or multilingual (European Comis-sion, 2012).
Multilingual speakers in immigrantcommunities switch across different languagesand cultures depending on the social and contex-tual factors present in the communication envi-ronment (Auer, 1988; Myers-Scotton, 2002; Ro-maine, 1995; Toribio, 2002; Bullock and Toribio,2009).
Example (1) illustrates Turkish-Dutchcode-switching in a post about video games in anonline discussion forum for the Turkish immigrantcommunity in the Netherlands.Example (1)user1: <dutch>vette spellllllllll </dutch>..<turkish>bir girdimmi cikamiyomm ..yendikce yenesi geliyo insanin</turkish>Translation: <dutch> awesome gameeeee</dutch>.. <turkish>once you are in it, it ishard to leave .. the more you win, the moreyou want to win</turkish>Mixing two or more languages is not a randomprocess.
There are in-depth linguistic descriptionsof code-switching across different multilingualcontexts (Poplack, 1980; Silva-Corval?an, 1994;Owens and Hassan, 2013).
Although these studiesprovide invaluable insights about code-switchingfrom a variety of aspects, there is a growing needfor computational analysis of code-switching inlarge datasets (e.g.
social media) where man-ual analysis is not feasible.
In immigrant set-tings, multilingual/bilingual speakers switch be-tween minority (e.g.
Turkish) and majority (e.g.Dutch) languages.
Code-switching marks multi-lingual, multi-cultural (Luna et al., 2008; Gros-jean, 2014) and ethnic identities (De Fina, 2007)of the speakers.
By predicting code-switchingpatterns in Turkish-Dutch social media data, weaim to raise consciousness about mixed languagecommunication patterns in immigrant communi-ties.
Our study is innovative in the following ways:?
We performed experiments on the longestand largest bilingual dataset analyzed so far.?
We are the first to predict code-switching insocial media data which allow us to investi-gate features such as emoticons.?
We are the first to exploit multi-word expres-sions to predict code-switching.?
We use automatic language identification atthe word level to create our dataset and fea-tures that capture previous language choices.The rest of this paper is structured as follows:we discuss related work on code-switching andmultilingualism in Section 2, our dataset in Sec-tion 3, a qualitative analysis in Section 4, our ex-perimental setup and features in Section 5, our re-sults in Section 6 and our conclusion in Section7.422 Related WorkCode-switching in sociolinguistics There israrely any consensus on the terminology aboutmixed language use.
Wei (1998) considers al-ternations between languages at or above clauselevels as code-mixing.
Romaine (1995) refers toboth inter-sentential and intra-sentential switchesas code-switching.
Bilingual speakers may shiftfrom one language to another entirely (Poplack etal., 1988) or they mix languages partially withinthe single speech (Gumperz, 1982).
In this study,we focus on code-switching within the same postin an online discussion forum used by Turkish-Dutch bilinguals.There are different theoretical models whichsupport (Myers-Scotton, 2002; Poplack, 1980) orreject (MacSwan, 2005; Thomason and Kaufman,2001) linguistic constraints on code-switching.According to (Thomason and Kaufman, 2001;Gardner-Chloros and Edwards, 2004) linguisticfactors are mostly unpredictable since social fac-tors govern the multilingual environments in mostcases.
Bhatt and Bolonyai (2011) have an exten-sive study on socio-cognitive factors that lead tocode-switching across different multilingual com-munities.Although multilingual communication has beenwidely studied through spoken data analyses, re-search on online communication is relatively re-cent.
In terms of linguistic factors C?ardenas-Claros and Isharyanti (2009) report differencesbetween Indonesian-English and Spanish-Englishspeakers in their amount of code-switching onMSN (an instant messaging client).
Durham(2003) finds a tendency to switch to English overtime in an online multilingual (German, French,Italian) discussion forum in Switzerland.The media (e.g.
IRC, Usenet, email, onlinediscussions) used for multilingual conversationsinfluence the amount of code-switching as well(Paolillo, 2001; Hinrichs, 2006).
Androutsopou-los and Hinnenkamp (2001), Tsaliki (2003) andHinnenkamp (2008) have done qualitative anal-yses of switch patterns across German-Greek-Turkish, Greek-English and Turkish-German inonline environments respectively.In terms of social factors, a number of studieshave investigated the link between topic and lan-guage choices qualitatively (Ho, 2007; Androut-sopoulos, 2007; Tang et al., 2011).
These stud-ies share the similar conclusion that multilingualspeakers use minority languages to discuss topicsrelated to their ethnic identity and reinforcing inti-macy and self-disclosure (e.g.
homeland, culturaltraditions, joke telling) whereas they use the ma-jority language for sports, education, world poli-tics, science and technology.Computational approaches to code-switchingRecently, an increasing number of research withinNLP has focused on dealing with multilingualdocuments.
For example, corpora with multilin-gual documents have been created to support stud-ies on code-switching (e.g.
Cotterell et al.
(2014))To enable the automatic processing and analysisof documents with mixed languages, there is ashift in focus toward language identification at theword level (King and Abney, 2013; Nguyen andDo?gru?oz, 2013; Lui et al., 2014).
Most closely re-lated to our work is the study by Solorio and Liu(2008) who predict code-switching in recordedEnglish-Spanish conversations.
Compared to theirwork, we use a large-scale social media datasetthat enables us to explore novel features.The task most closely related to automatic pre-diction of code-switching is automatic languageidentification (King and Abney, 2013; Nguyen andDo?gru?oz, 2013; Lui et al., 2014).
While automaticlanguage detection uses the words to identify thelanguage, automatic prediction of code-switchinginvolves predicting whether the language of thenext word is the same without having access to thenext word itself.Language practices of the Turkish communityin the Netherlands Turkish has been in con-tact with Dutch due to labor immigration sincethe 1960s and the Turkish community is thelargest minority group (2% of the whole popula-tion) in the Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor deStatistiek, 2013).
In addition to their Dutch flu-ency, second and third generations are also fluentin Turkish through speaking it within the familyand community, regular family visits to Turkeyand watching Turkish TV through satellite dishes.These speakers grow up speaking both languagessimultaneously rather than learning one languageafter the other (De Houwer, 2009).
In additionto constant switches between Turkish and Dutch,there are also literally translated Dutch multi-wordexpressions (Do?gru?oz and Backus, 2007; Do?gru?ozand Backus, 2009).
Due to the religious back-grounds of the Turkish-Dutch community, Arabic43words and phrases (e.g.
greetings) are part of dailycommunication.
In addition, English words andphrases are used both in Dutch and Turkish due tothe exposure to American and British media.Although the necessity of studying immigrantlanguages in Dutch online environments has beenvoiced earlier (Dorleijn and Nortier, 2012), thecurrent study is the first to investigate mixed lan-guage communication patterns of Turkish-Dutchbilinguals in online environments.3 DatasetOur data comes from a large online forum(Hababam) used by Turkish-Dutch speakers.
Theforum is active since 2000 and contains 28 sub-forums on a variety of topics (e.g.
sports, poli-tics, education).
Each subforum consists of mul-tiple threads which start with a thread title (e.g.
astatement or question) posted by a moderator oruser.
The users are Turkish-Dutch bilinguals whoreside in the Netherlands.
Although Dutch andTurkish are used dominantly in the forum, English(e.g.
fixed expressions) and Arabic (e.g.
prayers)are occasionally used (less than 1%) as well.
Wecollected the data between June 2005 and October2012 by crawling the forum.
Statistics of our dataare shown in Table 1.FrequencyNumber of posts 4,519,869Number of users 14,923Number of threads 113,517Number of subforums 29Table 1: Dataset StatisticsThe subforums Chit-Chat (1,671,436), Turkishyouth & love (447,436), and Turkish news & up-dates (418,135) have the highest post frequencywhereas Columns (4727), Science & Philosophy(5083) and Other Beliefs (6914) have the lowestpost frequency.An automatic language identification tagger isused to label the language of the words in postsand titles of the threads.
The tagger distinguishesbetween Turkish and Dutch using logistic regres-sion (Nguyen and Do?gru?oz, 2013) and achievesa word accuracy of approximately 97%.
We usethe language labels to train our classifier (sincegiven the labels we can determine whether thereis a switch or not), and to evaluate our model.4 Types of Code-SwitchingIn this section, we provide a qualitative analysis ofcode-switching in the online forum.
We differen-tiate between two types of code-switching: code-switching across posts and code-switching withinthe same post.4.1 Code-switching across postsWithin the same discussion thread, users reactto posts of other users in different languages.In example (2), user 1 posts in Dutch to teaseUser 2.
User 2 reacts to this message with ahumorous idiomatic expression in Turkish (i.e.
[adim cikmis] ?I made a name?)
to indirectlyemphasize that there is no reason for her to defendherself since she has already become famous asthe perfect person in the online community.
Thistype of humorous switch has also been observedfor Greek-English code-switching in face-to-facecommunication (Gardner-Chloros and Finnis,2003).
The text is written with Dutch orthographyinstead of conventional Turkish orthography (i.e.
[ad?m c??km?s?]).
It is probably the case that the userhas a Dutch keyboard without Turkish characters.However, writing with non-Turkish characters inonline environments is also becoming popularamong monolingual Turkish users from Turkey.Example (2)User1: <dutch> je hoefde niet gelijk in deverdediging te schieten hoor </dutch> :PTra: ?you do not need to be immediatelydefensive dear?User2: <turkish> zaten adim cikmismukemmel sahane kusursuz insana, bi deyine cikmasin </turkish> :(Tra: ?I already have established a name as agreat amazing perfect person, I do not needit to spread around once more?Example (3) is taken from a thread about break-fast traditions.
The users have posted what theyhad for breakfast that day.
The first user talksabout his breakfast in Turkish and describes theculture specific food items (e.g.
borek ?Turkishpastry?)
prepared by his mother.
The second userdescribes a typical Dutch breakfast and thereforeswitches to Dutch.Example (3)User1: <turkish>annemin peynirli boreklerive cay</turkish>Tra: ?the cheese pastries of my mom andtea?44User2: <dutch>Twee sneetjes geroost-erd bruin brood met kipfilet en een glasthee.</dutch>Tra: ?Two pieces of roasted brown bread withchicken filet and a cup of tea?4.2 Code-switching within the same postIn addition to code-switching across posts, we en-countered code-switching within the same post ofa user as well.
Manual annotation of a subset ofthe posts in Nguyen and Do?gru?oz (2013), suggeststhat less than 20% of the posts contain a switch.Example (4) is taken from a thread about Mother?sDay and illustrates an intra-sentential switch.
Theuser starts the post in Dutch (vakantie boeken ?tobook a vacation?)
and switches to Turkish sincebooking a vacation through internet sites or atravel agency is a typical activity associated withthe Dutch culture.Example (4)<dutch>vakantie boeken</dutch><turkish> yaptim annecigimee </turkish>Tra1:?
(I) <dutch>booked a holiday</dutch><turkish>for my mother.</turkish>?Example (5) is taken from a thread about Turk-ish marriages and illustrates an inter-sententialswitch.
The user is advising the other usersin Turkish to be very careful about choosingtheir partners.
Since most Turkish communitymembers prefer Turkish partners and followTurkish traditions for marriage, she talks aboutthese topics in Turkish.
However, she switchesto Dutch when she talks about getting a diplomain the Dutch school system.
Similar examples ofcode-switching for emphasizing different identi-ties based on topic have been observed for otheronline and face-to-face communication as well(Androutsopoulos, 2007; Gardner-Chloros, 2009).Example (5)<turkish>Allah korusun yani.
Kocani iyisec diyim=) evlilik evcilik degildir.</turkish><dutch>Al zou ik wanneer ik getrouwd beneen HBO diploma op zak hebben, zou ikhem dan denk ik niet verlaten.</dutch>Tra:?<turkish> May God protect you.Choose your husband carefully.
Marriage isnot a game </turkish> <dutch> Even if Iam married and have a university diploma, Idon?t think I will leave him </dutch>?Code-switching through greetings, wishes andformulaic expressions are commonly observed1It is possible to drop the subject pronoun in Turkish.
Astypical in bilingual speech, an additional Turkish verb yap-mak follows the Dutch verb boeken ?to book?.in bilingual face-to-face communication and on-line immigrant forums as well (Androutsopoulos,2007; Gardner-Chloros, 2009).5 Experimental SetupThe focus of this paper is on code-switchingwithin the same post.
We discuss the setup andfeatures of our experiment in this section.5.1 GoalWe cast the prediction of the code-switch pointwithin the post as a binary classification problem.We define the i-th token of the post as an instance.If the i + 1th token is in a different language, thelabel is 1.
Otherwise, the label is 0.Obtaining language labels In order to labeleach token of a post, we rely on the labels ob-tained using automatic language identification atthe word level (see Section 3).
This process maynot be the most accurate way of labeling each to-ken of a post at a large scale.
One particular arti-fact of this procedure is that an automatic taggermay falsely tag the language of a token in longerposts.
As a result, some lengthy posts might ap-pear to have one or more code-switches by ac-cident.
However, since the accuracy of our tag-ger is high (approx.
97% accuracy), we expectthe amount of such spurious code-switches to below.
For future work, we plan to experiment on adataset based on automatic language identificationas well as a smaller dataset using manual annota-tion.5.2 Creating train and test setsBefore we attempt to train a classifier on our data,we eliminate the biases and imbalances.
The ma-jority of posts do not contain any switches.
As aconsequence, the number of instances that belongto the ?0?
class (i.e.
no code-switching occurringafter the current word) grossly outnumber the in-stances of class ?1?, where code-switching takesplace.
In order to alleviate this class imbalance, forall our experiments, we sample an equal amountof instances from ?0?
and ?1?
classes randomly2,both for our training and testing data.
This waythe result will not favor the ?0?
class even if werandomly decide on the class label for each in-stance.
The average number of training and testing2We do 100 iterations and average the results of all theseindependent samples.45instances per iteration was 4000 and 80000 respec-tively.
By drawing 100 independent samples fromthe entire dataset, we cover a reasonable portion ofthe full data and do not sacrifice the balance of thetwo classes, which is crucially important for thevalidity of our results.5.3 Feature selectionWe use the following features (see Table 2) to in-vestigate code-switching within a post.5.3.1 Non-linguistic featuresEmoticons Emoticons are iconic symbols thatconvey emotional information along with lan-guage use in online environments (Dresner andHerring, 2014).
Emoticons have mostly been usedin the context of sentiment analysis (e.g.
Volkovaet al.
(2013), Chmiel et al.
(2011)).
Park et al.
(2014) studied how the use of emoticons differacross cultures in Twitter data.
Panayiotou (2004)studied how bilinguals express emotions in face-to-face environments in different languages.
Weare the first to investigate the role of emoticons as anon-linguistic factor in predicting code-switchingon social media.Emoticons in our data are either signified bya special tag [smiley:smiley type] or canappear in any of the common ASCII emoticonforms (e.g.
:), :-) etc.).
In order to detect theemoticons, we used a hand picked list of ASCIIemoticons as our dictionary, as well as a filter thatsearched for the special emoticon tag.
Since werely on an automatic language tagger, the languagelabel of a particular emoticon depends on its sur-rounding tokens.
If an emoticon is within a blockof text that is tagged as Turkish, then the emoticonwill automatically obtain a Turkish label (and ac-cordingly for Dutch).
For future work, we will ex-periment with labeling emoticons differently (e.g.introducing a third, neutral label).To assess the strength of emoticons as predic-tors of code-switching, we generate 4 differentfeatures (see Table 2).
These features capturewhether or not there is an emoticon at or beforethe token that we want to classify as the switchboundary between Dutch and Turkish.
We recordwhether there was an emoticon at token i (i.e.
thetoken we want to classify), token i ?
1 and tokeni ?
2.The last emoticon feature records whether thereis any emoticon after the current token.
We notethat this feature looks ahead (after the i-th token),and therefore cannot be implemented in a real timesystem which predicts code-switching on-the-fly.However, we included the feature for exploratorypurposes.5.3.2 Linguistic featuresLanguage around the switch point We also in-vestigate whether the knowledge of the languageof a couple of tokens before the token of inter-est, as well as the language at the token of inter-est, hold some predictive strength.
These featurescorrespond to #1-3 in Table 2.
Generally, the lan-guage label is binary.
However, if there are no to-kens in positions i ?
2 or i ?
1 for features #1and #2, we assign a third value to represent thisnon-existence.
Additionally, we explore whethera previous code-switching in a post triggers a sec-ond code-switching later in the same post.
We testthis hypothesis by recording feature #4 which rep-resents the existence of code-switching before to-ken i.Single word versus multi-word switch Thereis an on-going discussion in multilingualism aboutthe classification of switched tokens (Poplack,2004; Poplack, 2013) and whether there arelinguistic constraints on the switches (Myers-Scotton, 2002).
In addition to switches across in-dividual lexical tokens, multilingual speakers alsoswitch across multi-word expressions.Automatic identification of multi-word expres-sions in monolingual language use have beenwidely discussed (Baldwin et al., 2003; Baldwinand Kim, 2010) but we know little about how topredict switch points that include multi-word ex-pressions.
We are the first to include multi-wordexpressions as a feature to predict code-switching.We are mostly inspired by (Schwartz et al., 2013)in identifying MWEs.More specifically, we built a corpus of 3-gramMWEs (2,241,484 in total) and selected the mostfrequent 100 MWEs.
We differentiate betweentwo types of MWEs: Let the i-th token of a postbe the switch point.
For type 1, we take 3 tokens(all in the same language) right before the switchtoken (i.e.
terms i?
3, i?
2, i?
1).
[Allah razi ol-sun] ?May the Lord be with you?
and [met je eens]?agree with you?
are the two of the most frequentMWEs (in Turkish and Dutch respectively).For type 2, we take the tokens i ?
2, i ?
1, iand the last token is in a different language (e.g.
[Turkse premier Recep] ?Turkish prime-minister46Table 2: FeaturesFeature # Feature Description1 Language of token in position i ?
22 Language of token in position i ?
13 Language of token in position i (current token)4 Was there code-switching before the current token?5 Is there an emoticon in position i ?
2?6 Is there an emoticon in position i ?
1?7 Is there an emoticon in position i?8 Are there any emoticons in positions after i?9 Is the i-th token the first word of a 3-word multi-word expression?10 Is the i-th token the second word of a 3-word multi-word expression?11 Is the i-th token the third word of a 3-word multi-word expression?Recep?
).The first type of MWEs captures whether anMWE (all three words in the same language), sig-nifies code-switching for token i or not.The second type investigates whether there areMWEs that ?spill over?
the code-switching point(i.e.
the first two tokens of an MWE are in thesame language, but the third token is in anotherlanguage).
In order to get a good estimate of theMWEs in our corpus, we count the occurrences ofall these 3-grams and keep the top scoring ones interms of frequency, which end up as our dictionaryof MWEs.6 ResultsTo evaluate the predictive strength of our features,we conduct experiments using a Naive Bayes clas-sifier.In order to measure the performance, we trainthe classifiers for various combinations of the fea-tures shown in Table 2.
As we described in the pre-vious section, we train on randomly chosen, class-balanced parts of the data and we test on randomlyselected balanced samples (disjoint from the train-ing set), averaging over 100 runs.
For each com-bination of features, we measure and report aver-age precision, recall, and F1-score, with respect topositively predicting code-switching.Table 3 illustrates the performance of individ-ual features used in our classifier.
Features thatconcern the language of the previous tokens (i.e.features #1 & #2) seem to perform better thanchance in predicting code-switching.
On the otherhand, features #3 (language of the token in posi-tion i) and #4 (previous code-switching) have theworst performance.
In fact, the obtained classi-Table 3: Performance of individual featuresFeature # Precision Recall F1 score1 0.6305 1 0.77332 0.6362 1 0.77763 0 0 -4 0 0 -5 0.704 0.2116 0.32546 0.7637 0.2324 0.35647 0.8025 0.1339 0.09548 0.4879 0.3214 0.38759 0.5324 0.7819 0.633510 0.5257 0.8102 0.637611 0.5218 0.8396 0.6436fier always predicts no code-switching regardlessof the value of the feature.
Therefore, both pre-cision and recall are 0.
Features #1 & #2 behavedifferently from features #3 & #4 because #1 & #2have ternary values (the token language, or non-existing).
This probably forces the classifiers toproduce a non-constant decision.
For instance, themodel for feature #1 decides positively for code-switching if the language label is either Turkish orDutch and decides negatively if the label is non-existing.The rest of the individual features perform sim-ilarly but worse than #1 and #2.
Therefore, it isnecessary to use a combination of features insteadof single ones.After examining how features perform individu-ally, we further investigate how features behave ingroups.
We first group the features into homoge-nous categories (e.g.
#1-#3 focus on the languageof tokens, #5-#8 record the presence of emoticonsand #9-#11 refer to MWEs).
Subsequently, wetest the performance of these categories in differ-ent combinations, and finally measure the effect of47Table 4: Performance of groups of featuresFeatures Precision Recall F1 score1-3 Language of tokens 0.6362 1 0.77771-4 Language + previous code-switching 0.6663 0.1312 0.66635-8 Emoticons 0.6638 0.397 0.27669-11 MWEs 0.5384 0.7476 0.6265-11 Emoticons + MWEs 0.52 0.8718 0.64661-8 Language + previous code-switching + emoticons 0.6932 0.5114 0.46341-4, 9-11 Language + previous code-switching + MWEs 0.712 0.7297 0.71131-11 All 0.6847 0.8034 0.7106using all our features for the task.
Table 4 showsthe combinations of the features we used, as wellas the average precision, recall, and F1-score.According to Table 4, the combination of thelanguage of the tokens (features #1-#3) and theprevious code-switching earlier in the post (fea-tures #1-#4), and MWEs (features #9-#11) per-form the highest in terms of precision/recall.
Fea-tures #3 and #4 have rather low performances ontheir own but they yield a strong classifier in com-bination with other features.When we use features that record emoticons(#5-#8) or MWEs (#9-#11) alone, the performanceof our classifier decreases.
In general, MWEs out-perform emoticons.
We observe this performanceboost when we combine emoticon features withother features (e.g.
#1-#8) and with MWEs to-gether in the same subset (#1-#4, #9-#11).7 ConclusionWe focused on predicting code-switching pointsfor a mixed language online forum used bythe Turkish-Dutch immigrant community in theNetherlands.
For the first time, a long term dataset was used to investigate code-switching in so-cial media.
We are also the first to test new fea-tures (e.g.
emoticons and MWEs) to predict code-switching and to identify the features with sig-nificant predictive strength.
For future work, wewill continue our investigation with exploring thepredictive value of these new features within theTurkish-Dutch immigrant community as well asothers.8 AcknowledgementsThe first author was supported by the National Sci-ence Foundation (NSF), Grant No.
