FORUM ON MACHINE TRANSLAT IONMachine Translat ion already does WorkMargaret KingISSCO54, rte des AcaciasCH-1227 Geneva, SwitzerlandPANEL IST  STATEMENTThe first difficulty in answering a question like "Doesmachine translation work is that the question itself is ill-posed.
It takes for granted that there is one single thingcalled machine translation and that everyone is agreed aboutwhat it is.
But in fact, even a cursory glance at the systemsalready around, either in regular operational use or underdevelopment, will reveal a wide range of different types ofsystems.If we take first the dimension determined by who/whatdoes most of the work, the machine or the translator orrevisor, at one end of the scale are systems where the humandoes not intervene at all during the process of translation -"batch" systems for convenience here.
Even amongst thebatch systems there is considerable variety: the degree ofpre-editing i~ermitted or required varies greatly, as does theamount of post-editing foreseen.
Some systems insist thatanything translated by the machine should require no post-editing, and thus (sometimes) reject as unsuitable formachine treatment a part of the text.
Others take it forgranted that machine translation will normaly be post-edited,just as human translation is normally revised.
Some systemsaim at giving nothing more than a very rough raw trans-lation, to be used by the human translator only as a startingpoint for producing his own translation.
Some systems re-quire that the document to be translated conform to arestricted syntax, others leave the author relatively free.Next comes a class of systems that one might style"interactive" systems, where the bulk of the work is stilldone by the machine, but where the system interacts with ahuman to a greater or lesser degree.
Such systems may askthe human, for example, to resolve an ambiguity in thesource text, to choose between a set of target languageterms, to decide on correct use of prepositions, or any com-bination of the-~e and other similar tasks.Shifting towards the end of the scale where the bulk ofthe work is done by a human translator aided by a computersystem, there are.
systems which will automatically insertidentified technical terms, or replace a phrase occurringrepeatedly in the text by its translation wherever it appears,leaving the rest of the translation to be done by the humantranslator, systems where the translator as he produces thetranslation can consult specialist or general dictionaries, ei-ther constructed by the translator himself for the particularneeds of the text, or supplied by the system manufacturer.Many -indeed most- such systems are allied with clever text-processing systems pecially designed for use by translators.Finally, although perhaps not strictly machine translationsystems, but certainly of potentially great practical utility tothe working translator, are independent packages, not neces-sarily integrated into a translator's work station type of en-vironment.
These include automated terminology banks, dic-tionary look-up facilities, and general tools such as spelling orgrammar checkers.In all this, I have quite deliberately omitted considerationof machine translation systems conceived of as primarilyresearch tools, intended to test the validity of a particulartheory or to experiment with some new proposal, since I takeit that the worry lying behind the original question -and be-hind the moderator's statement- concerns ystems which arein some way subject to external evaluation, and which cantherefore lead to dissatisfaction.
The status of research andexperimental systems as valuable research tools seems quiteuncontentious.Now, just as machine translation is not a single in-divisible whole, but rather a range of systems haring onlythe common characteristic that they are used in one way oranother in performing the task of translation, so the need formachine translation is different, depending on the particularcharacteristics of individual situations.Here, so many factors come into determining what thereal need is that I shall not even attempt o give an exhaus-tive list, limiting myself instead to a handful of indicative,but necessarily over-simplified, examples.
Take first the ex-ample of a large translation service, translating documentsessentially very similar to one another, but in great volumeand frequently at very short notice.
This is the typical situa-tion in which what is needed is a batch service, producingreasonable quality translation which can if necessary berevised, where the degree of revision to be done depends onthe use to which the translated ocument is to be put.
(If thepoint of the document is to inform its readers in very generalterms of what was discussed in a particuler meeeting, per-haps no revision at all is necessary, if it is to serve as thebasis of discussion in a subsequent meeting, it may requirequite a lot of revision, if it is to serve as the basis of a treatyor an agreement, it should never have been allowed near amachine translation system in the first place, and the trans-lation should be thrown away).
In such a situation, an inter-active system, on the other hand, is likely to be unsuitable,since the main problem is the bulk of work to be done, andthe translator or revisor is better occupied dealing with thosedocuments unsuitable for machine treatment or revisingwhere necessary than in sitting in front of a screen watchingthe machine at work.In a different situation, however, where what is requiredis very high quality translation, and where the volume oftranslation to be done is a less pressing problem, so that themain concern is in rationalising the translator's work whilstcontingently increasing his productivity, an interactive sys-tem may prove to be the ideal choice, especially if the texttype is a mixture of repetitive material which it is boring(and time-wasting) to translate manually each time it ap-pears and quite delicate text requiring reat care.In yet another situation the major problem may be thetypical length of documents, combined with a need for speedand a need for terminological ccuracy, so that a single docu-ment is split over a number of translators working indepen-dently, but all must use the same translation for certainterms.
Here, the ideal system might well be simply to provideall the translators with access to a clever text-processor fromwithin which they could access easily a common term bank,with all the rest being left to the translator.There is no need to labour the point: different set-upshave different problems to solve, and therefore, whether theyknow it or not, need different kinds of machine translationsystems.Now we can return to the original question: machinetranslation works when the machine translation system isable to resolve in a significant measure the particuler trans-269lation problems in a particular situation.
To put this morecrudely, no-one should try to persuade the translator ofFaust that a batch trunslation system will do him any goodat all, and no-one should try to persuade the translation ser-vice that churns out several hundred invitations to meetingsevery day that an automated ictionary look-up facility willsolve their problems.Once this is realized, the puzzle contained in people as-king questions like whether it is a good idea to work onmachine translation in a world where it is demonstrably thecase that machine translation systems exist and are countedsatisfactory by their users begins to go away.
The succesfulsystems are those where what is provided by the systemmatches what is required to solve the real problem, wherethe system developers realistically assessed what they couldoffer, went ahead and provided that, and where those whocommissioned the construction or purchase of a system hadexpectations matched by what was actually delivered.A final question to those who claim that it is somehowdangerous or irresponsible to promise to produce a machinetranslation system.
If one promises and fails (apart of coursefrom the general principle that one should always try to fulfilone's promises and not to promise what one cannot deliver),why is that more damaging to the field than working onspeech-recognition and failing?270
