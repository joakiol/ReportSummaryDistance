A STRUCTURED REPRESENTAT ION OF WORD-SENSES I rOR SEMANTIC  ANALYSIS.Mafia Teresa PazienzaDipartimento di Informatica c Sistcmistica,Universita' "La Sapienza", RomaPaola VelardiIBM Rome Scientific (\]cntcrABSTRACTA framework for a structured representation ofsemantic knowledge (e.g.
word-senses) has been defined atthe IBM Scientific Center of Roma, as part of a project onItalian Text Understanding.
This representation, based onthe conceptual graphs formalism \[SOW84\], expresses deepknowledge (pragmatic) on word-senses.
The knowledge basedata structure is such as to provide easy access by thesemantic verification algorithm.
This paper discusses omeimportant problem related to the definition of a semanticknowledge base, as depth versus generality, hierarchicalordering of concept ypes, etc., and describes the solutionsadopted within the text understanding project.INTRODUCTIONThe main problem encountered in natural language(NL) understanding systems is that of the trade-off betweendepth and extension of the semantic knowledge base.Processing time and robustness dramatically get worse whenthe system is required to deeply understand texts inunrestricted domains.For example, the FRUMP system \[DEJ79\], basedon scripts \[SHA77\], analyzes texts in a wide domain byperforming a superficial analysis.
The idea is to captureonly the basic information, much in the same way of ahurried newspaper reader.A different approach was adopted in theRESEARCtlER system \[LEB83\], whose objective is toanswer detailed questions concerning specific texts.
Theknowledge domain is based on the description of physicalobjects (MPs: Memory Pointers), and their mutual relations(RWs: Relation Words).A further example is provided by BORIS \[LEH83\],one of the most recent systems in the field of textunderstanding.
BORIS was designed to understand asdeeply as possible a limited number of stories.
A firstprototype of BORIS can successfully answer a variety ofquestions on divorce stories; an extension to differentdomains appears however extremely complex withoutstructural changes.The current status of the art on knowledgerepresentation and language processing does not offerreadily available solutions at this regard.
The systempresented in this paper does not propose a panacea forsemantic knowledge representation, but shows the viabilityof a deep semaatic approach even in unrestricted domains.The features of the Italian Text Understandingsystem are summarized as follows:Text analysis is performed in four steps: morphologic,morphosyntactic, syntactic and semantic analysis.
Ateach step the results of the preceding steps are used torestrict Ihe current scope of analysis.
Hence forexample Ihe semantic analyzer uses the syntacticrelations identified by the parser to produce an initialset of possiNe interpretations of the sentence.Semantic knowledge is represented in a very detailedform (word_sense pragmatics).
Logic is used toimplement in a uniform and simple framework the datastructure representing semantic knowledge and theprograms performing semantic verification.For a detailed .vcrview of the project and a description ofmorphological nd syntactical nalyses refer to \[ANT87\] In\[VEI,g7\] a texl generation system used for Nt.
queryanswering is also described.The system is based on VM/PROLOG and analyzespress_agency releases in the economic domain.
Eventhough the specific application oriented the choice of wordsto be entered in the semantic data base, no other restrictionswhere added.
Press agency releases do not present anyspecific morphologic or syntactic simplification in thesentence structure.This paper deals with definition of knowledgestructures for semantic analysis.
Basically, the semanticprocessor collsi,qs of:1. a dictionary of word definitions.2.
a parsing algorithm.We here restrict our attention to the first aspect: thesemantic verification algorithm is extensively described in\[PAZ87\]The representation formalism adopted for worddefinitions is the conceptual graph model \[SOW84\],summarized in ,qectiml 2.
According to this model, a pieceof meaning (sm~teace or word definition) is represented asagraph of ~ r,m q, t~- a.d conceptual re\[alions249Section 3 states a correspondence b tween conceptualcategories (e.g.
concepts and relations) and word-senses.
Adictionary of hierarchically structured conceptual relations isderived from an analysis of grammar cases.Section 4 deals with concept definitions and typehierarchies.
Finally, Section 5 gives some implementationdetail.The present extention of the knowledge base (about850 word-sense definitions) is only intended to be antest-bed to demonstrate the validity of the knowledgerepresentation scheme and the semantic analyzer.
Thecontribution of this paper is hence in the field of computerscience and his objective is to provide a tool for linguisticexperts.TIlE CONCEPTUAL GRAPH MODELThe conceptual graph formalism unifies in apowerful and versatile model many of the ideas that havebeen around in the last few years on natural languageprocessing.
Conceptual graphs add new features to to thewell known semantic nets formalism, and make it a viablemodel to express the richness and complexity of naturallanguage.The meaning of a sentence or word is representedby a directed graph of concepts and conceptual relations.
Ina graph, concepts are enclosed in boxes, and conceptualrelations in circles; in the linear form, adopted in this paper,boxes and circles are replaced by brackets and parenthesis.Arrows indicate the direction of the relations amongconcepts.Concepts are the generalization of physicalperceptions (MAN, CAT, NOISE) or abstract categories(FREEDOM, LOVE).
A concept has the general form:\[NAME: referent\]The r~ferent indicates a specific occurrence of the conceptNAME ~t'or example \[DOG: Fido\]).Conceptual relations express the semantic linksbetween concepts.
For example, the phrase "John eats ~ is:'cpresented as follows:\[PERSON: John\] < --(AGNT) < --\[EAT\]where (AGNT) is a diadic relation used to explicit the activerole of the entity John with respect o the action of eating.In order to describe word meanings, in \[SOWg4\]several types of conceptual graphs are introduced:1.
Type definitions.The type of a concept is the name of the class towhich the concept belongs.
Type labels are structuredin a hierarchy: the expression C>C'  means that thetype C is more general than C' (for example,ANIMAl .
- MAN); C is called the supertype of C'.A type C is defined in terms of species, that is themore general class to which it belongs, and differentia,that is what distinguishes C from the other types of thesame species.
The type definition for MAN is :\ [ANIMAl  ,\] .
.
.
.
(CHRC)-- > \ [RATIONAL\ ]where (ClIP.C.)
is the characteristic relation.2.
Canonical graphs.Canonical graphs express the semantic constraints(or semantic expectations ruling the use of a concept.For example, the canonical graph for GO is: l\ [GO 1-(AONT)-- > \ [MOBILE_ENTITY\](I)F~qT)-- > \ [PLACE\]Many ~f the ideas contained in \[SOWS4\] have beenused in our work.
The original contribution of this papercan be summarized by the following items:find a clear correspondence between the words ofnatural language and conceptual categories (conceptsand relations).?
provide a lexicon of conceptual relations to expressthe semanlic formation rules of sentencesuse a l,ragmatic rather than semantic expectationapproach to represent word-senses.
As discussed later,the latter seems not to provide sufficient information toanalyze m~t trivial sentences.To make a clear distinction between word-senseconcepts and abstract ypes.
It is not viable to arrangeword-senscs in a type hierarchy and to preserve at thesame time the richness and consistency of theknowledge base.The following sections discuss the above listed items.Concepts, relations and words.The pr()htem analyzed in this section concerns thetranslation of a words dictionary into a concept-relationdictionary.
Which words are concepts?
Which are relations?Which, if any.
are redundant for meaning representation?Concepts and relations are semantic ategories whichhave been adopted with different names in many models.Besides ct~nceplual graphs, Schank's conceptual dependencyWord  definit ions in l inear form are represented by wrighting in Ihe Ihsl line the name o f  the word  W(concept  or relat ion) to be def ined,  and in the fol lowing lines a lisl o f  graphs,  l inked on their left.
s ide toW.250\ [$HA72\]  and semantic nets in their variousimplementations \[BRA79\] \ [GRI76\]  represent sentences asa net of concepts and semantic links.The ambiguity between concepts and relations issolved in the conceptual dependency theory, where a set ofprimitive acts and conceptual dependencies are employed.The use of primitives is however questionable due to thepotential loss of expressive power.In the semantic net model, relations can be rolewords (father, actor, organization etc.)
or verbs (eat, is-a,possess etc.)
or position words (on, over , left etc.
),depending on the particular implementation.In \ [ sowg4\ ]  a dictionary of conceptual relations isprovided, containing role words (mother, child, successor),modal or temporal markers (past, possible, cause etc.
),adverbs (until).In our system, it was decided to derive some clearguidelines for the definition of a conceptual relation lexicon.As suggested by Fillmore in \[F1L68\], the existence ofsemantic links between words seems to be suggested bylexical surface structures, such as word endings,prepositions, syntactic roles (subject, object etc.
),conjunctions etc.
These structures do not convey a meaningper se, but rather are used to relate words to each other in ameaningful pattern.In the following, three correspondence rules betweenwords, lexical surface structures and semantic categoriesare proposed.Correspondence between words and concepts.Words are nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns,not-prepositional adverbs.
Each word can have synonyms ormultiple meanings.RI: A biunivocal correspondence is assigned betweenmain word meanings and concept names.
Proper names(John, Fldo) are translated into the referent field of theentity type they belong to (\[PERSON: John\] ).Correspondence between determiners and referentsDeterminers (the, a, etc.)
specify whether a wordrefers to an individual or to a generic instance.R2: Determiners are mapped into a specific orgeneric oncept referent.For example "a dog" and "the dog" are translatedrespectively into \[DOG: *\[ and \[DOG: *x\[, where * and *xmean "a generic instance" and "a specific instance".
Theproblem of concept instantiation is however far morecomplex; this will be objective of luther study.Correspondence between lexical surface structures andconceptual relationsThe role of prepositions, conjunctions, prepositionaladverbs (hef~re, under, without etc.
), word endings (nice-st,gold-en) verb endings and auxiliary verbs is to relatewords, as in "1 go by bus", modify the meaning of a name,as in "she is the nicest", determine the tenses of verbs as in"I was going", etc.Like w~rds, functional signs may have multipleroles (e.g.
by, to etc.
), derivable from an analysis ofgrammar cases.
(The term case is here intended in itsextended meaning, as for Fillmore).R3: A biunivocal correspondence is assumed betweenroles played t'.y./itnctional signs and conceptual relations.Conceptual relations occurrences which have alinguistic correspondent in the sentence (as the one listedabove) are called e.~plicit This does not exhaust the set ofconceptual relations; there are in fact syntactic roles whichare not expressed by signs.
For example, in the phrase"John eats" there exist a subject-verb relation between"John" and "eats"; in the sentence "the nice girl", theadjective "nice" is a quality complement of the noun "girl" .Conceptual relalions which correspond to these syntacticroles are called implicitA conceptual relation is only identified by its roleand might have implicit or explicit occurrences.
Forexample, the phrases "a book about history" and "anhistory book" both embed the argument (ARG) relation:\ [BOOK\]  .
.
.
.
(A RG)--:> \ [HISTORY\]The translation of surface lexical structure intoconceptual relations allows to represent in the same wayphrases wilh the same meaning but different syntacticstructure, as in the latter example.Conceptual relations also explicit the meaning ofsyntactic roles.
For example, the subject relation, whichexpresses the active role of an entity in some action,corresponds m different semantic relation, like agent(AGNT) as in ".lohn reads", initiator (INIT) as in "Johnboils potatoes" (John starts the process of boiling),participant (I'ART) as in "John flies to Roma" (Johnparticipates to a flight), instrument (INST) as in '.
'the knifecuts".
The genitive case, expressed explicitly by thepreposition "of" or by the ending "'s", indicates a socialrelation (SOC_I,~F,|,) as in "the doctor of John" or in "thefather of my friend", part-of (PART-OF) as in "John'sarm", a real ,~r metaphorical possession (POSS) as in"John's book" and "Dante's poetry", etc.
(see Appendix).The idea of ordering concepts in a type hierarchywas extended to conceptual relations.
To understand theneed of a relati~m hierarchy, consider the following graphs:\[ B t tll.I ~1 NG\]--  > (AGE)-- > \[YEAR: #50\]\ [B I f l l  DING\]--> (EXTEN)-- > \[HEIGHT: !130\]\ [BI!
I I .
I~ING\]--~-(PRICE)--> ELIRE: #5.000\](AGI!).
(F.XTEN) and (PRICE) representrespectively Ih~, age, extension and price relations.
By251defining a supertype (MEAS) relation, the three statementsabove could be generalized as follows:\ [BU ILD ING\ ] - -  > (MEAS)-- > \ [MEASURE:  *x\]Appendix 1 lists the set of hierarchically orderedrelation types.
At the top level, three relation categorieshave been defined:Role.
These relations specify the role of a concept withrespect o an action (John (AGNT) eats), to a function(building for (MEANS) residence) or to an event (adelay for (CAUSE) a traffic jam).2.
Complement.
Complement relations link an entity to adescription of its structure (a golden (MATTER)  ring)or an action to a description of its occurrence (going to(D EST) Roma).3.
Link.
Links are entity-entity or action-action type ofrelations, describing how two or more kindredconcepts relate with respect to an action or a way ofbeing.
For example, they express a social relation (themother of (SOC_REL) Mary), a comparison (John ismore (MAJ) handsome than Bill), a time sequence (thesun after (AFTER) the rain), etc.STRUCTURED REPRESENTAT ION OF CONCEPTS.This section describes the structure of the semanticknowledge base.
Many natural anguage processing systemsexpress semantic knowledge in form of selection restrictionor deep case constraints.
In the first case, semanticexpectations are associated to the words employed, as forcanonical graphs; in the second case, they are associated tosome abstraction of a word, as for example in Wilk'sformulas \ [WlL73\ ]  and in Shank's primitive conceptualcases \ [SHA72\] .Semantic expectations however do not provideenough knowledge to solve many language phenomena.Consider for example the following problems, encounteredduring the analysis of our text data base (press agencyreleases of economics):1.
Metonimies"The state department, he ACE and the trade unionssign an agreement""The meeting was held at the ACE of Roma"In the first sentence, ACE designates a humanorganization; it is some delegate of the ACE whoactually sign the agreement.
In the second sentence,ACE designates a plant, or the head office where ameeting took place.2.
Syntactic ambiguity"The Prime Minister Craxi went to Milano for ameeting""President Cossiga went to a residence forhandicapped"In the first case, meeting is the purpose of the act go,in the second "handicapped" case specifies thedestinat#m of a building.
In both examples, syntacticrules are unable to determine whether the prepositionalphrase should be attached to the noun or to the verb.Semantic expectations cannot solve this ambiguity aswell: for example, the canonical graph for GO (seeSection 2) does not say anything about the semanticvalidity of the conceptual relation PURPOSE.3.
Conjtmctions"The slate department, he ACE and the trade unionssign an agreement""A meeting between trade unionists and the Ministerof tne Interior, Scalfaro"In the first sentence, the comma links to differenthuman chillies; in the second, it specifies the name of aMinister.The above phenomena, plus many others, like metaphors,vagueness, ill formed sentences etc., can only be solved byadopting a pragmatic approach for the semantic knowledgebase.
Pragmatics is the knowledge about word uses,contexts, figures of speech; it potentially unlimited, butallows to handle without severe restrictions the richness ofnatural language.
The definition of this semanticencyclopedia is a challenging objective, that will require ajoint effort nf linguists and computer scientists, l lowever,we do not believe in short cut solution of the naturallanguage processing problem.Within our project, the following guidelines wereadopted for 0w definition of a semantic encyclopedia:Each word-sense have an entry in the semantic database; Ihis entry is called in the following a conceptdefinition2.
A concepl definition is a detailed description of itssemantic expectations and of its semantically permitteduses (for example, a car is included as a possiblesubject of drinl~ as in "my car drinks gasoline", apurpose and a manner are included as possiblerelations fi~r go)3.
F.ach word use or expectation is represented by anelementary ,2raph :( i) \[Wl.-  (~aEl.
CONC)-:->\[C\]where \\' is the concept to be defined, C some otherconcept tx'pe, and <-> is either a left or a rightarrow.Partitioning a definition in elementary graphs makes it easyfor the verificalion algorithm to determine whether aspecific link between two words is semantically permitted ornot.
In facl, g ve ~ two word-senses W1 and W2, these aresemantically related by a conceptual relation REL_CONC if252there exist a concept W in the knowledge base including thegraph:\[W\] <- > (REL_CONC) <- > \[C\]where W> =WI and C> =W2.
To reduce theextent of the knowledge base, C in (1) should be the mostgeneral type in the hierarchy for which the (1) holds.
Theproblem of defining a concept hierarchy is however acomplex one.
The following subsection deals with typehierarchies.Word-senses and Abstract ClassesMany knowledge representation formalisms for naturallanguage order linguistic entities in a type hierarchy.
This isused to deduce the properties of less general concepts fromhigher level concepts (property inheritance).
For example, ifa proposition like the one expressed by graph (1) is true,then all the propositions obtained by substitution of C withany of their subtypes must be true.
However, generalizationof properties is not strictly valid for linguistic entities; forexample the graphs:(2) \[GO\]-- >(OBJ)-- > \[CONCRETE\](3) \[WATCH\]-- >(AGNT)-- > \[BLIND\]are both false, even though they are specializationsrespectively of the following graphs:(4) \[MOVE\]--  > lOB J)-- > \[CONCRETE\](5) \[WATCH\]-- >(AGNT)-- > \[ANIMATE\]In fact, the sentences "to go something" and "a blindwatches" violate semantic constraints and meaningpostulates: generalization does not preserve bothcompleteness and consistency of definitions.
In addition, if apragmatic approach is pursued, one quickly realizes that noword-sense definition really includes ome other; each wordhas it own specific uses and only partially overlap with otherwords.
The conclusion id that is not possible to arrangeword-senses in a hierarchy; on the other side, it isimpractical to replace in the graph (1) the concept ype Cwith all the possible word-senses Wi for which (1) is valid.A compromise solution has been hence adopted.
Thehierarchy of concepts i structured as follows:1.
There are two levels of concepts: word-senses andabstract classes;2.
Concepts associated to word-senses (indicated by italiccases) are the leaves of the hierarchy;Abstract conceptual classes, as MOVE_ACTS,HUMAN_ENTITIES, SOCIAL_ACTS etc.
(uppercases) are the non-terminal nodes.In this hierarchy word-sense concepts are never linked bysupertype relations to each other, but at most bybrotherhood.
Definitions are provided only forword-senses; abstract classes are only used to generalizeelementary graphs on word uses.This solution does not avoid inconsistencies; forexample, the graph (included in the definition of theword-sense person):(6) \[person\] "--(AGNT) <--\[MOVE_ACT\]is a semantic representation f expressions like: John moves,goes, jumps, runs etc.
but also states the validity of theexpression "John is the agent of flying" which is instead notvalid if John is a person.
However the definition offly willinclude:(7) Ifly\]-- " (AC~NT)-- > \[WINGED_ANIMATi?~S\](8) \[fly\]-- -(I 'ARTICIPANT)--> \ [HUMAN\]The semantic algorithm (described in \[PAZ87\]) asserts thevalidity of a link between two words WI and W2 only ifthere exist a conceptual relation to represent the meaning ofthat link.
In c,rder for a conceptual relation to be accepted:1.
This relation must be included in some elementarygraph (~f W1 and W22.
The type constraints imposed by the elementary graphsmust bc satisfied for both W1 and W2.In conclusion, it is possible to write general conditions onword uses wiHmut get worried about exceptions.
Thefollowing section gives an example of concept definition.Concept definitionsConcept definitions have two descriptors:classilTcation and de l?nition.1.
Classificalkm.Besides the supertype name, this descriptor alsoincludes a type definition, introduced in Section 2.
Forexample, the type definition for houseis "building for residence", which in terms ofconceptual graphs is:\[BUII,1)ING\] ."

Scheme of the Text Understanding SystemAll the modules are implemented in VM/PROLOG and runon IBM 3812 mainframe.
The morphology associates atleast one lemma to each word; in Italian this task isparticularly complex due to the presence of recursivegeneration mechamsrns, such as alterations, nominalizationof verbs, etc.
I.~r example, from the lemma casa (home) itis possible I, derive the words cas-etta (little home),cas-ett-ina (nice little home), cas-ett-in-accia (ugly nice littlei254home) and so on.
At present, the morphology is complete,and uses for its analysis a lexicon of 7000 lemmata\[ANT87\].The syntactic analysis determines syntacticattachment between words by verifying grammar ules andforms agreement; he system is based on a context freegrammar \[ANT87\].
Italian syntax is also more complexthan English: in fact, sentences are usually composed bynested hypotaetical phrases, rather than linked paratactical.For example, a sentence like "John goes with his girl friendMary to the house by the river to meet a friend for a pizzaparty ~ might sound odd in English but is a commonsentence structure in Italian.Syntactic relations only reveal the surface structureof a sentence.
A main problem is to determine the correctprepositional ttachments between words: it is the task ofsemantics to explicit the meaning of preposition and todetect he relations between words.The task of disambiguating word-senses and relatingthem to each other is automatic for a human being but isthe hardest for a computer based natural anguage system.The semantic knowledge representation model presented inthis paper does not claim to solve the natural languageprocessing problem, but seems to give promising results, incombination with the other system components.The semantic processor consists of a semanticknowledge base and a parsing algorithm.
The semantic database presently consists of 850 word-sense definitions; eachdefinition includes in the average 20 elementary graphs.Each graph is represented by a pragmatic rule, with theform:(1) CONC_REL(W,*x) < -COND(Y,*x).The above has the reading :"*x modifies the word-sense Wby the relation CONC_REL if *x is a Y".
For example, thePR:AGNT(think,*x) < -COND(H UMAN_ENTITY,*y).corresponds to the elementary graph:\[think\]-- > (AGNT)-- > \[HUMAN_ENTITY\]The rule COND(Y,*x) requires in general a more complexcomputation than a simple supertype test, as detailed in\[PAZ87\].
The short term objective is to enlarge thedictionary to 1000 words.
A concept editor has beendeveloped to facilitate this task.
The editor also allows tovisualize, for each word-sense, a list of all the occurrences ofthe correspondent words within the press agency releasesdata base (about 10000 news).The algorithm takes as input one or more parsetrees, as produced by the syntactic analyzer.
The syntacticsurface structures are used to derive, for each couple ofpossibly related words or phrases, an initial set ofhypothesis fi~r the correspondent semantic structure.
Forexample, a noun phrase (NP) followed by a verb phrase(VP) could be represented by a subset of the LINK relationslisted in the Appendix.
The specific relation is selected byverifying type cnnstraints, expressed in the definitions of thecorrespondent concepts.
For example, the phrase "Johnopens (thc door)" gives the parse:NP:- NOUN(.Iohn)VP = V F.l~, ll(opens)A subject-verb relation as the above could be interpreted byone of tile following conceptual relations: AGNT,PARTICII~ANT, INSTRUMENT etc.
Each relation istested for ~emanlic plausibility by the rule:(2) RFI._CON??
(?,y) <- (x: REL_CONC(x,*y= y) )&(y: REI._CONC(*x = x,y) ).The (2) is proved by rewriting the conditions expressed onthe right end side in terms of COND(Y,*x) predicates, as inthe (I), and Ihcn attempting to verify these conditions.
Inthe above cxamplc, (1) is proved true for the relationAGNT, because:AGNT(open,person: John)<- (open: AGNT(open,*x = person: John) )&(person: AGNT(*y = open,person: John)).
(open: AGNT(open,*x) < -COND(HUMAN_ENTITY,*x).
(person: AGNT(*y,person) <-COND(MOVE ACT,*y)).The conceptual graph will be\[PERSON: John 1 .
: --(AGNT) < --\[OPEN\]For a detailed description of the algorithm, refer to\[PAZ87\] At the end of the semantic analysis, the systemproduces two possible outputs.
The first is a set of shortparaphrases of the input sentence: for example, given thesentence "The ACE signs an agreement with thegovernment" gives:The Society ACE is the agent of the act SIGN.AGP, EEM ENT is the result of the act SIGN.The GOVERN M EN'F participates to the AGREEMENT.The second output is a conceptual graph of the sentence,generated using a graphic facility.
An example is shown inFigure 2.
A PROI.OG list representing the graph is alsostored in a ,:la~ahase for future analysis (query answering,deductions etc.
).As far aq lhe semantic analysis is concerned, currentefforts are directed towards tile development of a queryanswering system and a language generator.
Future studieswill concentrate on discourse analysis.255fo.
