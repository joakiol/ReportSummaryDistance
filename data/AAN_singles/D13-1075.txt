eye movements inreading.
The individual variation betweenreaders reportedly made application acrossreaders impossible.
While a tree-based modelseems plausible for eye movements, we showthat competitive results can be obtained witha linear CRF model.
Increasing the inductivebias also makes learning across readers pos-sible.
In fact we observe next-to-no perfor-mance drop when evaluating models trainedon gaze records of multiple readers on newreaders.1 IntroductionWhen we read a text, our gaze does not movesmoothly and continuously along its lines.
Rather,our eyes fixate at a word, then skip a few words,to jump to a new fixation point.
Such rapid eyemovements are called saccades.
Sometimes we evenjump backwards.
Backward saccades are called re-gressions.
Gaze can be recorded using eye track-ing devices (Starr and Rayner, 2001).
Since eyemovements in reading give us important informationabout what readers find complicated in a text, andwhat readers find completely predictable, predictingeye movements on new texts has many practical ap-plications in text-to-text generation and human com-puter interaction, for example.The problem of predicting eye movements inreading is, for a reader ri and a given sequence ofword tokens w1 .

wn, to predict a set of fixationpoints F ?
{w1, .
.
.
, wn}, i.e., the fixation points ofri?s gaze.
For each token wj , the reader ri may skipwj or fixate at wj .
Models are evaluated on record-ings of human reading obtained using eye trackingdevices.
The supervised prediction problem that weconsider in this paper, also uses eye tracking data forlearning models of eye movement.Nilsson and Nivre (2009) first introduced this su-pervised learning task and used the Dundee corpusto train and evaluate a tree-based model, essentiallytreating the problem of predicting eye movements inreading as transition-based dependency parsing.We follow Hara et al(2012) in modeling onlyforward saccades and not regressions and refix-ations.
While Nilsson and Nivre (2009) try tomodel a subset of regressions and refixations, theydo not evaluate this part of their model focusingonly on fixation accuracy and distribution accuracy,i.e., they evaluate how well they predict a setof fixation points rather than a sequence of points inorder.
This enables us to model eye movements inreading as a sequential problem of determining thelength of forward saccades, increasing the inductivebias of our learning algorithm in a motivated way.Note that because we work with visual input, wedo not tokenize our input in our experiments, i.e.,punctuation does not count as input tokens.Example Figure 1 presents an example sentenceand gaze records from the Dundee corpus.
TheDundee corpus contains gaze records of 10 readersin total.
Note that there is little consensus on whatwords are skipped.
5/10 readers skip the first word.Generally, closed class items (prepositions, copulae,quantifiers) seem to be skipped more open, but wedo see a lot of individual variation.
While others forthis reason have refrained from evaluation acrossreaders (Nilsson and Nivre, 2009; Hara et al 2012),803SentenceAre tourists enticed by these attractions threathening their very existence?r1 Fixate Fixate Fixate Skip Fixate Fixate Fixate Skip Fixate Fixater2 Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixater3 Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Skip Fixater4 Skip Fixate Fixate Skip Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixater5 Skip Fixate Fixate Skip Fixate Fixate Fixate Skip Fixate Fixater6 Skip Fixate Fixate Skip Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Skip Fixater7 Skip Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixater8 Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixater9 Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixater10 Skip Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Fixate Skip Fixate# skips 5 0 0 4 0 0 0 2 3 0Figure 1: The gaze records of the three first readers for the first sentence in the Dundee corpus.we show that our model predicts gaze better acrossreaders than a previously proposed model (Nilssonand Nivre, 2009) does training and evaluating on thesame readers.
A final observation is that fixationsare very frequent at the word level ?
in fact, evenskilled readers make 94 fixations per 100 words(Starr and Rayner, 2001) ?
which motivates usingF1-score of skips as metric.
We follow Nilsson andNivre (2009) in reporting word-level accuracy, butfind it particularly interesting that the simple modelproposed here outperforms previous models by alarge margin in F1-score over skips.Related work Below we use a sequential modelrather than a tree-based model to bias our modeltoward predicting forward saccades.
Nilsson andNivre (2009), in contrast, present a more expressivetree-based model for modeling eye movements, withsome constraints on the search space.
The transition-based model uses consecutive classification ratherthan structured prediction.
The features used in theirmodel are very simple.
In particular, they use useword lengths and frequencies, like us, as well asdistances between tokens (important in a transition-based model), and, finally, the history of previousdecisions.Hara et al(2012) use a linear CRF model for thesame problem, like us, but they consider a slightlydifferent problem, namely that of predicting eyemovement when reading text on a specific screen.They therefore use screen position as a feature.
Inaddition, they use word forms, POS, various mea-sures of surprise of word length, as well as per-plexity of bi- and trigrams.
The features relating toscreen position were the most predictive ones.2 Our approachWe use linear CRFs to model eye movements inreading.
We follow Hara et al(2012) in using smallwindow sizes (at most five words) for extracting fea-tures.
Rather than using word forms, POS, etc.,we use only word length and the log probability ofwords ?
both known to correlate well with likeli-hood of fixation, as well as fixation times (McDon-ald and Shillcock, 2012; Kliegl et al 2004; Rein-gold et al 2012).
The model thus reflects a hy-pothesis that eye movements are largely unaffectedby semantic content, that eye movements depend onthe physical properties and frequency of words, andthat there is a sequential dependence between fixa-tion times.
Tabel 1 gives the complete set of fea-tures.
We also evaluated using word forms and POSon held-out data, but this did not lead to improve-ments.
There is evidence for the impact of mor-phology on eye movements (Liversedge and Blythe,2007; Bertram, 2011), but we did not incorporatethis into our model.
Finally, we did not incorporatepredictability of tokens, although this is also knownto correlate with fixation times (Kliegl et al 2004).Hara et al(2012) use perplexity features to capturethis.We use a publicly available implementation of lin-ear CRFs1 with default parameters (L2-regularized,C = 1).1https://code.google.com/p/crfpp/8043 Predicting a reader?s eye movementsIn this experiment we consider exactly the same set-up as Nilsson and Nivre (2009) considered.
In theDundee corpus, we have gaze data for 10 persons.The corpus consists of 2,379 sentences, 56,212 to-kens and 9,776 types.
The gaza data was recordedusing a Dr. Bouis Oculometer Eyetracker, samplingthe position of the right eye every millisecond.
Weuse texts 1?16 (1911 sentences) for training, 17?18 (237 sentences) for development and 19?20 (231sentences) for testing.Results are presented in Table 2 and are slightlybetter than Nilsson and Nivre (2009), mainly be-cause of better predictions of skips.
Our error re-duction over their model in terms of F1 over skipsis 9.4%.
The baseline model used in Nilsson andNivre (2009), the E-Z Reader (Reichle et al 1998),obtained a fixation accuracy of 57.7%.4 Predicting across readersHara et al(2012) consider the problem of learningfrom the concatenation of the gaze data from the 10persons in the Dundee corpus, but they also evalu-ate on data from these persons.
In our second ex-periment, we consider the more difficult problem oflearning from one person?s gaze data, but evaluat-ing on gaze data from another test person.
This is amore realistic scenario if we want to use our modelto predict eye movements in reading on anyone butour test persons.
This has been argued to be impossi-ble in previous work (Nilsson and Nivre, 2009; Haraet al 2012).Our results are presented in Table 3.
Interestingly,results are very robust across reader pairs.
In fact,only in 4/10 cases do we get the best results trainingon gaze data from the reader we evaluate on.
Notealso that the readers seem to form two groups ?
(a, b,h, i, j) and (c, d, e, f, g) ?
that provide good trainingmaterial for each other.
Training on concatenateddata from all members in each group may be benefi-cial.5 Learning from multiple readersIn our final experiment, we learn from the gazerecords of nine readers and evaluate on the tenth.This is a realistic evaluation of our ability to predictfixations for new, previously unobserved readers.
In-terestingly we can predict the fixations of new read-ers better than Nilsson and Nivre (2009) predict fix-ations when the training and test data are producedby the same reader.
The results are presented in Ta-ble 4.
In fact our skip F1 score is actually better thanin our first experiments.
As already mentioned, thisresult can probably be improved by using a subset ofreaders or by weighting training examples, e.g., byimportance weighting (Shimodaira, 2000).
For now,this is left for future work.6 DiscussionOur contributions in this paper are: (i) a model forpredicting a reader?s eye movements that is compet-itive to state-of-the-art, but simpler, with a smallersearch space than Nilsson and Nivre (2009) and asmaller feature model than Hara et al(2012), (ii)showing that the simpler model is robust enough tomodel eye movements across readers, and finally,(iii) showing that even better models can be obtainedtraining on records from multiple readers.It is interesting that a model without lexical infor-mation is more robust across readers.
This suggeststhat deep processing has little impact on eye move-ments.
See Starr and Rayner (2001) for discussion.The features used in this study are well-motivatedand account as well for the phenomena as previouslyproposed models.
It would be interesting to incor-porate morphological features and perplexity-basedfeatures, but we leave this for future work.7 ConclusionThis study is, to the best of our knowledge, the firstto consider the problem of learning to predict eyemovements in reading across readers.
We presenta very simple model of eye movements in read-ing that performs a little better than Nilsson andNivre (2009) in terms of fixation accuracy, evaluatedon one reader at a time, but predicts skips signifi-cantly better.
The true merit of the approach, how-ever, is its ability to predict eye movements acrossreaders.
In fact, it predicts the eye movements ofnew readers better than Nilsson and Nivre (2009) dowhen the training and test data are produced by thesame reader.805ReferencesRaymond Bertram.
