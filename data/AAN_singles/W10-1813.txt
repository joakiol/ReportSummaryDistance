languageOta OgieNorwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)ota.ogie@hf.ntnu.noAbstractLanguage documentation is important as a toolfor preservation of endangered languages andmaking data available to speakers andresearchers of a language.
A data base such asTypeCraft is important for typology studies bothfor well documented languages as well as littledocumented languages and is a valid tool forcomparison of languages.
This requires thatlinguistic elements must be coded in a mannerthat allows comparability across widely varyinglanguage data.
In this paper, I discuss how Ihave used the coding system in TypeCraft forthe documentation of data from ?
?d?
language, alanguage belonging to the Edoid group of theBenue-Congo subfamily of the Volta-Congolanguage family and spoken in Mid-WesternNigeria, West Africa.
The study shows howsyntactic, semantic and morphologicalproperties of multi-verb constructions in ?
?d?
(Benue-Congo) can be represented in arelational database.1.
IntroductionIn this paper1, I show some ways in which I amusing a shared methodology in my research onmulti-verb constructions.
My research iscentered around the language ?
?d?, spoken inMid-Western Nigeria, Ga and Akan (kwa), andthe tool is the system TypeCraft, which hasbeen developed in the ISK department, NTNUand first documented in Beermann and Prange(2006).??d?
language belongs to the Niger-Congo, Atlantic-Congo, Volta-Congo, Benue-Congo-Edoid language family.
The Ediod1 I thank Professor Lars Hellan, NTNU Norway for hiscomments on earlier versions of this paper.language family consists of 33 languages and19 of these languages have either very littledocumentation or no documentation available.Multi-verb constructions are constructionsin which the verbs in series must function asindependent verbs in simple constructions,with at least one shared argument and nomarking of syntactic dependency.The paper shows how syntactic, semanticand morphological properties of multi-verbconstructions in ??d?
(Benue-Congo) can berepresented in a relational database and thedevelopment of annotation standards thatcontribute to contrastive and typologicalresearch.
The analysis is extended to multi-verb constructions in the following languagesof the Niger-Congo: Ga and Akan (Kwa).2.
TypeCraftTypeCraft is a tool for typological analysis thatallows for annotation, classification and searchof data along different morphological,syntactic, semantic and pragmatic criteria.
Inannotating it is important to have annotationschemes that allow for typological andcontrastive studies.In this paper I use an annotation schemefor verbal constructions currently beingdeveloped at NTNU and documented in Hellanand Dakubu (2009).
Syntactic and semanticinformation about construction types areprovided by templates composed by labels.The basic structural parts of a template arereferred to as slots that are separated byhyphens.
A template with a verbal head canconsist of maximal 7 slots; (1) POS of thehead, and diathesis information; (2) valencespecification; (3) dependent specification; (4)participant roles; (5) aspect and aktionsart; (6)109situation type; (7) provides a linking typebetween slot 6 situation type and thespecifications in slots 2-4.
Slots 1 and 2 areobligatorily filled, the others not.
(cf.
Hellanand Dakubu, 2009).
At present annotation ofthe construction labels is manual and notincorporated into the TypeCraft.
HoweverTypeCraft provides a construction tier wherethis information can be incorporated.3.
Sentence level and word levelannotationTypeCraft provides a set of glosses forsyntactic and semantic coding and a set ofparameters along which sentences may beclassified that allow for standardizedannotation and cross linguistic comparison asillustrated in figure1:figure1: Word and sentence level annotation3.1 Word levelWord level annotation allows for analysis ofpredicates in terms of syntactic and semanticproperties including information about thesubcategorization properties and argumentstructure of predicates.Figure2: Text editor in TypeCraftshowing word level annotationType craft features 7 tiers that provideinformation at the word level as shown in the??d?
example below.(1).

tr inSlot2 states that the verb is transitive,suAg_obThincrem in Slot 4 states that the NPthat is the subject of the construction bears anagent theta role and the object an incrementaltheme theta role.
Lastly slot 5 gives theinformation that the aktionsart of theconstruction is completed monodevelopment.1103.2 Sentence levelTypeCraft provides a set of global tags at thesentence level that allows for classification interms of syntactic and semantic automaticallygenerated construction parameters such asconstituent type, core constituent vs adjunct,transitivity, thematic roles, situation and aspecttypes, propositional types and polarity.
Polarityis based on the assumption that States OfAffairs (SOA) comes in pairs: positive andnegative.

Area 2 gives the valence information aswell as information about grammaticalfunction and thematic roles (underlined forease of exposition).
Information about thesituation type of the construction is providedby Area 3 and is written in capital letters.Information about tense, aspect, moodand negation is also provided by area 1 in theconstruction labels.
Sharing of these featuresacross verbs in series is represented as withsharing of arguments as in example (3) fromAkan below.(3).

In addition, to the labeling conventionsused by Hellan and Dakubu (2009) for SVCs(sv) and EVCs (ev, pv), the following globallabels are introduced to account for the rangeof multi-verb constructions in my data.cc ?

Text , phrasal and constructionsearchTypeCraft allows for search using differentword level and sentence level parameters.
Thisfacilitates comparative analysis in multi-verbconstructions.
For example, argument sharingis a property that identifies types of multi-verbconstructions.
A search using the constructionlabel svsuObIDALL is used as illustration.
Theresult gives an output of serial verbconstructions in ??d?

ConclusionStandardized annotations and online databasessuch as TypeCraft aid linguists and speakers ofa language in research, preservation oflanguages and in producing literacy materialsthat aid education and literacy.
My research onmulti-verb constructions in ??d?
is the first in-depth annotation for ??d?
and will be easilyavailable for languageresearchers/teachers/students all over theworld.6.
