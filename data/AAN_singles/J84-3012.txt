Take a few nanosecondsto explore the rootsof comput ingIn the rush to carry on the workof the information age, it is wise forcomputer professionals to regularlylook back at the beginnings of thecomputer evolution.While viewing the history of com-puters may seem a luxury in the faceof an ever-changing environment, itis surprising how rich this history isin terms of wheels already inventedand common problems already solved.It is also ironic that many computerprofessionals--who have dedicatedthemselves to processing informationat a rapid speed to save time for endusers--avoid sitting back and pon-dering the historic value of their work.The American Federation of In-formation Processing Societies, Inc.,has a publication that can provide avaluable window to yesterday.Computing's "roots"The Annals of the History ofComputing isa documentation f the"roots" of this relatively new profes-sion.This unique publication appearsfour times a year, with contributorsexploring the evolution of the com-puter and the people who have as-sisted in its development and accept-ance within business and society.There are numerous advantages tobeing a regular reader of the Annalsof the History of Computing.For example, time spent perusingthe Annals provides avaluable insightinto the information mangementprofession and its future directions.In addition, reading about the prim-itive technologies designed by thepioneers in the field can be an amus-ing experience in light of what isknown today.However, and more important, ifcomputer professionals cast away theadvantage of hindsight and put them-selves into those early environmentsof discovery, these professionals thenbuild an affinity with their predeces-sors--and they develop more creativeapproaches to the problems of proc-essing information.Contemporary solutionsIn short, what numerous readersof the Annals of the History of Com-puting are finding out is that thereare solutions to contemporary prob-lems to be found in the historic reviewof the field and its early leaders.
"Just as we look to the historian ofgovernment for a better understand-ing of government, and to the his-torian of art for a better understandingof art, so we are entitled to look tothe historian of technology for a betterunderstanding of technology."
Thatview belongs to management con-sultant Peter Drucker, in an articlewhich appears in the October 1982Annals.For those people who see historyas the happenings of men and womenthousands of years ago, the history ofcomputers may seem to be rushingthings a bit.Since the field emerged only about35 years ago, any attempt at creatinga historic perspective might appear,premature.
Yet, the historic analysisof the profession's work, as publishedin the Annals, among other maga-zines and books, is one vehicle whichwill aid in the maturing of the profes-sion as well as its visibility with thepublic.It is time to reflect on the potenthistory of the computer and its abilityto process information.By subscribing to the Annals of theHistory of Computing, you can relivean exciting era of modern history.- Richard F.
