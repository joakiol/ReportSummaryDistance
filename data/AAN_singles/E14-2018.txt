an OS andlanguage independent tool for clauseannotation and alignment, developed at theDepartment of Computational Linguistics,Institute for Bulgarian Language, BulgarianAcademy of Sciences.
The tool supportsautomated sentence splitting and alignmentand modes for manual monolingual annotationand multilingual alignment of sentences andclauses.
Anaphora has been successfullyapplied for the annotation and the alignment ofthe Bulgarian-English Sentence- and Clause-Aligned Corpus (Koeva et al.
2012a) and anumber of other languages including Frenchand Spanish.1 IntroductionFor years now corpus annotation has played anessential part in the development of various NLPtechnologies.
Most of the language resources,however, do not include clause annotation andalignment which are considered quite useful inrecent research on Machine Translation (MT)and parallel text processing (Piperidis et al.,2000; Sudoh et al., 2010; Ramanathan et al.,2011).Aiming to facilitate and improve the processof clause annotation and alignment ofmultilingual texts, we developed Anaphora.The tool is OS and language independent andsupports automated sentence splitting andalignment, manual  sentence and clause splitting,validation, correction and alignment, selectionand annotation of conjunctions (includingcompounds (MWE)), and identification of thetype of relation between pairs of syntacticallyconnected clauses.2 User Interface and FunctionalitiesAnaphora supports two kinds of operating modes:a monolingual and a multilingual one.The monolingual mode is designed for manualediting and annotation of each part of the parallelcorpus.
The window consists of three activepanes (Fig.
1): Text view (top pane), Sentenceview (bottom left-hand pane) and Clause viewand annotation (bottom right-hand pane).Figure 1.

monolingual mode.69In this mode the user may chose a file forverification and post-editing of the automaticallyperformed sentence alignment.
The individualmonolingual texts which are part of an alignedpair are selected by the file tabs.The monolingual mode offers the followingfunctionalities:?
sentence splitting;?
clause splitting;?
correction of wrong splitting (merging ofsplit sentences/clauses);?
annotation of conjunctions;?
selection of compounds;?
identification of the type of relationbetween pairs of syntactically connectedclauses.The end of a sentence may be changed bychoosing the last word of the sentence andmarking it using the End button from the topmenu.
Thus, the selection of the word as asentence end is toggled and if it was marked asan End word, it is no longer such and thefollowing sentence is automatically merged tothe current one.
If the word has not been alreadymarked as an end, it is thus marked as one andthe sentence is automatically split.Clicking on any word of a sentence in the Textview pane results in the sentence appearing in theSentence view pane, where clause segmentationand choice of conjunction are performed.
Theuser defines the boundaries of clauses byselecting the words in them.
This is achieved bymarking the particular fragment of the text in theSentence view pane with the mouse and pressingthe 'space' key.
This operation toggles theselection.
Thus, a repeated use causes deselection.Marking a disconnected clause is done bymarking the block of text containing it andunmarking the unnecessary words.
When aclause is defined, it is listed in the bottom right-hand pane in a new color following the surfaceorder of the sentence.
Selection of a clausewithin another clause is also possible.
Then theinner clause is listed directly after the split clausewhile the order of the split clause in the Clauseview pane depends on the position of its firstword in the sentence.Once the clauses are defined, the user mayannotate the conjunction of two clauses, alsoreferred to as a marker.
The marker may consistof one or more words or an empty word.
Emptywords (w="====") are artificial elementsautomatically introduced at the beginning of apotential new clause.
An empty word may beselected as a marker when the conjunction is notexplicit or the clauses are connected by means ofa punctuation mark (for simplicity of annotationpunctuation marks are not identified asindependent tokens but are attached to thepreceding token).
When a word or acompound from one clause is selected in theSentence view pane the user chooses anotherclause from the Clause view pane to create a pairof syntactically linked clauses.
Then the relationfor the pair is identified by selecting its type withthe grey buttons N_N (coordination), N_S(subordinated clause following the main clause),S_N (subordinated clause preceding the mainclause), etc.The multilingual mode is selected with thealign tab.
In this mode annotators can create,validate and correct the alignment of the parallelunits ?
sentences and/or clauses.The window (Fig.
2) has two parallel Textview panes (on the top) and two parallel Listview panes (in the bottom).
Depending on thechosen menu (Clause or Sentence) the bottompanes show lists of aligned clauses or sentences.Figure 2.

multilingual mode.70The multilingual mode uses the output of themonolingual sentence and clause splitting andsupports the following functionalities:?
automated sentence alignment;?
manual sentence alignment;?
manual clause alignment.Automated sentence alignment is available asa menu command (Auto Sentence Align) in themultilingual mode.
?o switch to manual sentence or clausealignment the corresponding menu commandsare used ?
Sentence and Clause.In the sentence menu the two bottom panesshow lists of aligned sentences, each pair in adistinct color.
The user may correct thealignment by choosing one or more sentences ineach of the bottom panes and pressing the 'space'button to create a new alignment bead.In the clause menu, when a sentence isselected in one of the two Text panes, its clausesare listed in the respective bottom pane.
Thecorresponding aligned sentence appears in theparallel top pane with its clauses listed in thebottom.
Alignment is performed when the userchooses one or more clauses from each of thebottom panes and then presses the 'space' button.Thus a new clause alignment bead is created.3 ApplicationsAnaphora was successfully used for theannotation and the alignment of the Bulgarian-English Sentence- and Clause-Aligned Corpus(Koeva et al.
2012a) which was created as atraining and evaluation data set for automaticclause alignment in the task of exploring theeffect of clause reordering on the performance ofSMT (Koeva et al., 2012b).Since its development the tool is continuouslyused for annotation and clause alignment ofdifferent parts of the Bulgarian-X languageParallel Corpus (Koeva et al.
2012c) covering anumber of languages including French andSpanish.4 ImplementationAnaphora was designed as a self-sufficientmodule for annotation and clause alignmentwithin the multi-functional platform Chooser(Koeva et al.
2008) which supports various NLPtasks that involve corpora annotation.The tool is a stand-alone single userapplication implemented in Python and it usesthe standard GUI library tkinter (the Tcl/Tkpython binding) which makes it highly OSindependent.5 Data Processing and Representation5.1 Input DataThe used format is a flat xml with rootelement text.
The text is a list of word elementswith several attributes like ?w?
?
wordform, ?l?
?lemma, ?u?
?
annotator, ?t?
?
timestamp, ?e?
?sentence end, etc.Special attributes are responsible for markingthe compounds (MWE) and clauses.
The wordsthat are members of a compound share acommon value for the attribute ?p?
(parent).Similarly, the words in a clause share a commonvalue for clause ?
?cl?.This format is compatible with the othermodules of the Chooser platform.
Thus, one filecan be annotated with several different types ofannotation like POS, semantic annotation, etc.The system provides import scripts for twoformats ?
plain text and the output of theBulgarian Language Processing Chain (Koevaand Genov, 2011) ?
a TSV/CSV family format,where the text is tokenized and lemmatized.Sentence splitting depends on the format ofthe input text.
If it is a plain text, sentencesplitting is based on the presence of end ofsentence punctuation (full stop, exclamationmark, and question mark) followed by a capitalletter.
When the file is of the TSV/CSV familyformat sentence splitting is part of the LanguageProcessing Chain.715.2 Automated Sentence AlignmentThe automated sentence alignment isperformed using the Gale-Church aligningalgorithm (Gale and Church, 1993).6 Conclusions and Future WorkWe believe that, based on its design andfunctionalities, Anaphora can be easily used andit will perform well for any given pair oflanguages, that is, it is to a great extent languageindependent.
The system can also be applied as itis for phrase segmentation and word and phrasealignment.
However, if we want to includesimultaneous alignment of words, phrases, andclauses the system needs to be adopted.We work on including additional functionalitiesto facilitate corpora annotation and parallel textprocessing such as anaphora annotation.Our future intentions include also publishing it asan Open Source code so that it can serve the NLPcommunity.AcknowledgmentsThe present paper was prepared within theproject Integrating New Practices andKnowledge in Undergraduate and GraduateCourses in Computational Linguistics(BG051PO001-3.3.06-0022) implemented withthe financial support of the Human ResourcesDevelopment Operational Programme 2007-2013co-financed by the European Social Fund of theEuropean Union.
