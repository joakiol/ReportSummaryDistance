WitteDepartment of Computer Science and Software EngineeringConcordia University, Montre?al, Canada1 IntroductionNLP methods for extracting mutation informationfrom the bibliome have become an important newresearch area within bio-NLP, as manually curateddatabases, like the Protein Mutant Database (PMD)(Kawabata et al, 1999), cannot keep up with therapid pace of mutation research.
However, whilesignificant progress has been made with respectto mutation detection, the automated extraction ofthe impacts of these mutations has so far not beentargeted.
In this paper, we describe the first workto automatically summarize impact informationfrom protein mutations.
Our approach is basedon populating an OWL-DL ontology with impactinformation, which can then be queried to providestructured information, including a summary.2 BackgroundMutations are alterations, rearrangements, orduplications of genetic material, impacting proteinproperties like stability or activity.
For example:H86A/E/F/K/Q/W decreased the enzyme stability at 60?C byup to 95% and the transition temperature by 2.5?C to 5.8?C.Impacts are described through other concepts,since mutational events may cause changes to phys-ical quantities such as pH and temperature.
Aspresented in the above example, the named mu-tations (H86A/E/F/K/Q/W) made changes to thethermostability by 2.5?2.8 degrees Celsius.
Hence,we extract (i) units of measurement, e.g., %, degreeCelsius, min; (ii) protein properties: stability, ac-tivity and others; and (iii) impact words, includingincrease, stabilize, and reduce.Measurable impacts can thus be classified basedon the type of effect (increase, decrease or destabi-lize) on the protein property.3 Related workLittle previous work exists on automatically detect-ing and extracting mutation impacts.
An excep-tion is EnzyMiner (Yeniterzi and Sezerman, 2009),which performs document classification for disease-related mutations.
This work differs significantlyfrom ours, as we are concerned with sentence-levelimpact detection and summarization.4 Mutation Impact DetectionOur main contribution for impact detection andsummarization consists of two major parts: an on-tology describing impacts on a semantic level, andan NLP pipeline for detecting impacts in docu-ments in order to populate the ontology.
Furtheranalysis, including summarization, can then be per-formed on this NLP-populated ontology throughontology queries and reasoning.Ontology Design.
Our Mutation Impact Ontol-ogy conceptualizes impacts and the mutations asso-ciated with them.
The main concepts are: Mutation:An alteration or a change to a gene and developinga different offspring.
UnitOfMeasurement: A classfor measurement units.
MutImpact: Mutation effecton protein properties.
ProteinProperty: A class forproperties of ?Protein?
and subclassed by differentproperties like ?Activity?
and ?Stability.?
To designthe Mutation Impact Ontology, information aboutseveral other elements is needed: Text elements,biological entities and entity relations.
The rela-tions between these entities are expressed as OWLobject properties.Mutation Impact Extraction.
Impacts are de-tected through a combination of an OntoGazetteerannotating impact words, measurement units, etc.,and JAPE grammar transducers, e.g.
:Rule: MutationImpact({Lookup.majorType == ?onto impact?
}):impact ?
?> {try {// get Impact annotationsgate.AnnotationSet impactSet = (gate.AnnotationSet)bindings.get(?impact?);...
}Here, the impact word that is marked as ?Lookup?with a feature of ?majorType,?
?onto impact?
is128annotated as ?MutImpact.?
Accordingly, ?Protein-Property?
and ?UnitOfMeasurement?
are annotatedthrough similar JAPE grammars.
Finally, each sen-tence is annotated as containing impact informationor not.
All the units of measurement and proteinproperties (ProteinProperty) existing in that sen-tence (impact) are recorded for subsequent ontol-ogy export.Mutation-Impact Relation Extraction.
Whenthe entities such as mutations and impacts are iden-tified and annotated, the sentence containing theimpact word expressions (MutImpact) is associatedwith the nearest ?Mutation,?
making the simpleassumption that the nearest mutation invokes theimpacts mentioned.
The complete sentence is thenconsidered as an impact sentence.For each mutation-impact relation, we record theconnection together with a number of properties,including units of measurement and effects.Ontology Population.
After preprocessing thedocuments and extracting the entities, the ontol-ogy is populated with the extracted entities suchas mutations, mutation impact and their relationsmutation impact relations.5 Impact SummarizationThe exported, populated OWL impact ontology canbe queried using the SPARQL query language.
Tosummarize impacts for a certain mutation, we cansimply query the ontology for all detected impactsand extract the corresponding impact sentences:PREFIX onto: <http://www.owl?ontologies.com/unnamed.owl#>SELECT ?sentenceFROM <http://www.owl?ontologies.com/unnamed.owl#>WHERE { ?document onto:containsSentence ?sentence.
?sentence onto:contains ?MutImpact.
?Mutation onto:mutationMutImpactRel ?MutImpact}ORDER BY DESC (?document) DESC (?Mutation)These are then collected into a textual summaryproviding the mutations with their impacts for theuser, as shown in Fig.
1.6 EvaluationThe performance of the system was evaluated onthe abstracts of four different mutation corpora,each on a specific protein family: Xylanase(19 documents), Haloalkane Dehalogenase(23 documents), Subtilisin (5 documents), andDioxygenase (11 documents).
Altogether, 58documents were manually annotated with theirimpacts.
For each annotation ?Sentence,?
a binaryfeature ?impact?
is considered.

Although thedetection of mutation impacts has shown to be suc-cessful by this simple proximity heuristic to someextent, in some cases the impacts are missing ordetected partially.
Also, in cases where the impactscaused by a set of mutations, just one mutation(the nearest one) is considered, and the remainingmutations are ignored.
Impacts are not always theresult of the nearest mutation; However, automati-cally analysing the text and specifying the correctmutation associated with the impacts needs morecomplex analysis.ReferencesT.
