deAbstractAn asymptote is derived from Turing's local reestimation formula for populationfrequencies, and a local reestimation formula is derived from Zipf's law for theasymptotic behavior of population frequencies.
The two are shown to be qualita-tively different asymptotically, but nevertheless to be instances of a common classof reestimation-formula-asymptote airs, in which they constitute the upper andlower bounds of the convergence r gion of the cumulative of the frequency func-tion, as rank tends to infinity.
The results demonstrate hat Turing's formula isqualitatively different from the various extensions to Zipf's law, and suggest that itsmooths the frequency estimates towards a geometric distribution.1 Int roduct ionTuring's formula \[Good 1953\] and Zipf's law \[Zipf 1935\] indicate how population frequencies ingeneral tend to behave.
Turing's formula estimates locally what the frequency count of a speciesthat occurred r times in a sample really would have been, had the sample accurately reflectedthe underlying population distribution.
Zipf's law prescribes the asymptotic behavior of therelative frequencies of species as a function of their rank.
The ranking scheme in questionorders the species by frequency, with the most common species ranked first.
The reasonthat these formulas are of interest in computational linguistics is that they can be used toimprove probability estimates from relative frequencies, and to predict he frequencies of unseenphenomena, e.g., the frequency of previously unseen words encountered in running text.Due to limitations in the amount of available training data, the so-called sparse-data pro-blem, estimating probabilities directly from observed relative frequencies may not always bevery accurate.
For this reason, Turing's formula, in the incarnation of Katz's back-off scheme\[Katz 1987\], has become a standard technique for improving parameter estimates for probabi-listic language models used by speech recognizers.
A more theoretical treatment of Turing'sformula itseff can be found in \[N?das 1985\].Zipf's law is commonly regarded as an empirically accurate description of a wide varietyof (linguistic) phenomena, but too general to be of any direct use.
For a bit of historic con-troversy on Zipf's law, we refer to \[Simon 1955\], \[Mandelbrot 1959\], and subsequent articles inInformation and Control.
The model presented there for the stochastic source generating thevarious Zipfian distributions i however linguistically highly dubious: a version of the monkey-with-typewriter scenario.The remainder if this article is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we induce a recurrenceequation from Turing's local reestimation formula and from this derive the asymptotic beha-vior of the relative frequency as a function of rank, using a continuum approximation.
Theresulting probability distribution is then examined, and we rederive the recurrence quationfrom it.
In Section 3, we start with the asymptotic behavior stipulated by Zipf's law, andderive a recurrence quation similar to that associated with Turing's formula, and from this770induce a corresponding reestimation formula.
We then rederive the Zipfian asymptote fromthe established recurrence quation.
In Section 4, similar techniques are used to establish theasymptotic behavior inherent in a general class of recurrence quations, parameterized by areal-valued parameter, and then to rederive the recurrence quations from their asymptotes.The convergence r gion of this parameter for the cumulative of the frequency function, as rankapproaches infinity, is also investigated.
In Section 5, we summarize the results, discuss howthey might be used practically, and compare them with related work.2 An  Asymptote  for Tur ing 's  FormulaTuring's formula reestimates population frequencies locally:x* = (x+l) .
N.+~ N~ (1)Here N~ is the number of species with frequency count x, and x* is the improved estimate ofx.
Let N be the size of the entire population and note thatx ~rN = ~x 'N .
and f~ =x----1where X is the count of the most populous species and f~ is the relative frequency of anyspecies with frequency count x.Let r(x) be the rank of the last species with frequency count x.
This means that quite ingeneralr(x)X= Z Nkk=xX Xi x  = ~ ik  - ~ ik  = r(~)-  r(x + 1) (2)k=x k=x+l2.1  A cont inuum approx imat ionWe first make a continuum approximation by extending Nx from the integer points x = 1, 2 , .
.
.to a continuous function N(x) on \[1, oo).
This means thatx xr(x) = ~Nk ,~ ~ N(y)dyk----xDifferentiating this w.r.t, z, the lower bound of the integral, yieldsdr(x) d f xdx - dx N(y) dy = -N(x)and using the chain rule for differentiation yieldsdr dr dx= d~'~ = -N(x l .N  (a)Continuum approximations are useful techniques for establishing the dependence of a sumon its bounds, to the leading term, and for determining convergence.
For example, if we wish to71n in  n 3 - -  1study the sum ~ k 2, we note that the corresponding integral J l x 2 dx = - -  and concludek---1 32n 3 -F 3n 2 + nthat the sum behaves like n 3.
The exact formula is 6 , so we in fact even gotCOthe leading coefficient right.
Likewise, we can establish for what values of a the sum ~ k ~k=lconverges by explicitly calculatingf l  X a dx = X c~+l\ [~-~- l J l  for o~ -~ -1indicating that the integral, and thus the sum, converge for c~ < -1  and diverge for ~ > -1 .We have to be a bit careful with the transition to the continuous case.
We will first let Nxbecome large and then establish what happens for small, but non-zero, values of ff = ~.
Soalthough x will be small compared to N,  it will be large compared to any constant C. Thismeans thatx x+Cf = l im ~ = l im N-*oo N N--+co Nfor any additive constant C, and we may approximate x + C with x, motivatingand similar approximations in the following.1 1z+l  x2.2 The  asymptot ic  d i s t r ibut ionFor an ideal Turing population, we would have x = z*.
This gives us the recurrence quationIgN=+i  = x + l " N= (4)implying that there are equally many inhabitants for frequency count x as for frequency countx + 1.
This introduces everal additional constraints, namely.N 1 x ?

Thisdistribution was created by approximating our original discrete distribution with a continuousone.
The discrete counterpart of an exponential distribution is a geometric distributionP(r) = p. (1 -  p)r-1 r= l ,2 , .

.parameterized by p, the probability of some outcome occurring in one trial.
P(r) can thenbe interpreted as the probability of waiting r trials for the first occurrence of the outcome.Thus, Turing's formula seems to be smoothing the frequency estimates towards a geometricdistribution.2.3 Reder iv ing  Tur ing 's  fo rmulaTo test our derivation of the asymptotic equation (7) from the recurrence equation (4), we willattempt o rederive Eq.

Note that the derivation of Zipf's recurrence quation in Eq.
(9) ofSection 3 corresponds to the special case where a = 1, i.e., where 8 = 2.5 ConclusionsThe relationship between Turing's formula and Zipf's law, which both concern population fre-quencies, was explored in the present article.
The asymptotic behavior of the relative frequencyas a function of rank implicit in one interpretation of Turing's local reestimation formula wasderived and compared with Zipf's law.
While the latter relates the rank and relative frequencyas asymptotically inversely proportional, the former states that the frequency declines expo-nentially with rank.
This means that while Zipf's law implies a finite total population, Turing'sformula yields a proper probability distribution also for infinite populations.In fact, it is tempting to interpret Turing's formula as smoothing the relative-frequencyestimates towards a geometric distribution.
This could potentially be used to improve sparse-data estimates by assuming a geometric distribution (tail), and introducing a ranking basedon direct frequency counts, frequency counts when backing off to more general conditionings,order of appearance in the training data, or, to break any remaining ties, lexicographical order.Conversely, a local reestimation formula in the vein of Turing's formula was derived fromZipf's law.
Although the two equations are similar, Turing's formula shifts the frequency masstowards more frequent species.
The two cases were generalized to a single spectrum of reesti-marion formulas and corresponding asymptotes, parameterized by one real-valued parameter.Furthermore, the two cases correspond to the upper and lower bounds of this parameter forwhich the cumulative of the frequency function converges as rank tends to infinity.These results are in sharp contrast o common belief in the field; in \[Baayen 1991\], forexample, we read: "Other models, such as Good (1953) .
.
.
have been put forward, all ofwhich have Zipf's law as some special or limiting form."
All of the Zipf-Simon-Mandelbrotdistributions exhibit the same basic asymptotic behavior,Cf ( r )  = r"'~parameterized by the positive real-valued parameter 8- Comparing this with Eq.
(15), we find1 1that ~ - 8--Z-1 > 0 and thus 8 = 1 + ~ > 1.
In view of the established exponentially decliningasymptote of the ideal Turing distribution, corresponding to 8 = 1, we can conclude that thelatter is qualitatively different.AcknowledgementsThis article originated from inspiring discussions with David Milward and Slava Katz.
