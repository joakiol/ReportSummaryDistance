First of all, thecriteria are described that are used toidentify the elementary units of under- ~ ing structure and the operations con- oining them into complex units (Sect.l),then  the main types  o f  ~n~ts and operat ionsresulting from an empirical investigationon the  bas i s  o f  the c r i te r ia  a re  reg is te r -ed (Sect .2 ) ,  and f ina l ly  the ru les  o f  in -fe rence ,  account ing  fo r  the  re levantaspects of the relationship between ling-uistic and cognitive structures areillustrated ~Secto3).I.
A system of natural languageunderstanding may gain an advantage fromusing the underlying structure of sent-ences (which with some approaches can beidentified with the level of meaning orof logical form) as one of its startingpo in ts ,  ins tead  o f  work ing  w i th  wordspecific roles.
Ar~menta  for such astandpoint, which were presented in Haji-~ov~ and S~all (1980), include the follow-ing two maln points:(a )  natural language is universal,i.e.
its structure makes it possible toexpress an unlimited n~-.ber of assertions,questions, etc?
t by finite means} onceits underlying (tectogrammatical) struct=ure is known, it is possible to use it aian output language of natural languageanalysis in man-machine communication andthus, without any intellectual effort onthe  s ide  o f  the user ,  to  ensure  the  funct -i on ing  o f  automat ic  quest ion  answer ingsystems (or  o f  systems o f  d ia logues  w i throbots, etc.)}
even if many simplificat-ions have been included into such asystem, it is then known what has beensimplified and it is possible to removethe simplifications whenever necessary(e.g.
if the system is to be used for an-other  se t  o f  tasks ,  inc lud ing  the  ana l -ys i s  o f  a b roader  se t  o f  input texts ,quest ions ,  e tc . )
;(b) linguistic meaning is ~ystem-atic, so that the configurations of"deep cases" (valency), tenses~ moda l i toias, number, etc.
make it possible tofind full~ reliable information; on theother hand, such systems as those baaedon scenarios or scripts work in mostcases with rules that are valid for theunmarked cases (in a marked case e.g.lunch in a restaurant can be taken by anemployee of the restaurant, who does notreserve a table, order the meals and P~7for them ***)?To find out which of the semanticand pragmatic distinctions are reflectedin the system of language ~or, in otherwords, to find out in what respects theunderlying structure of sentences differfrom their surface patterns) testableoperational criteria are needed~ thesecriteria should help to distinguishl(i) whether two given surface -_nitsare  s t r i c t ly  synonymous ( i ?e .
share  a tleas t  one o f  the i r  mean ings) ,  or  not~(ii) whether a single surface unithas more than  one meaning ( i s  ambiguous) ,or whether a sibgle meaning is concerned swhich is vague or indistinct (cf.
Zwickyand Sadock, 1975; Kasher and Gabbay, |976}Keenan, 1978);(iii) whether a given distribution-al res t r i c t ion  be longs  to  the tec togra - - .
-atical level, or whether it is givenonl~ by the cognitive content itself, i.e.by extralinguistic conditions;(iv) between a case of deletion (ofa tectogra~saatical unit by surface rules)and the absence o f  the g iven  un i t  in  theunder ly ing  s t ruc ture ;(v) between d i f fe rent  k inds  o ftectogrammatical units (e.g.
inner part-icipants of cases, and free or adverbialmodifications);(vi) which tectogrammatical unithas been deleted, in case more of themcan occupy the deleted position (el.21the  tec togrammAt ica l  d i f fe rence  betweenthe  e lements  o f  the  top ic  and those  o fthe  focus  o f  the  sentence ,  o r  more exact ly ,between contextua l ly  bound and non-bounde lements  o f  the  meaning o f  the  sentence) .As for (i), a criterion has beenelaborated that works similarly as Car-nap s intensional isomorphism, but isadapted for the structure of natural lan-guage, the surface gr-mmAtical means ofwhich also exhibit synor%vmY: He expectedthat Mary comes and He expectedMary tocome are considered synonymous, sincewl---~any lexical (and morphological)cast such two sentences correspond toa single proposition (a single truthvalue is assigned to any possible world).On the other hand .John talked toa girl about a problem is not consideredto be synonymous with John talked abouta problem to a girl, since the known(Lakoff s) examples with a specific~ uantification do not share their truth onditions; also our simple examplesdiffer in their tectogr~mmatical struc-tures (having different topic-focus ar-ticulations).For points (ii), (iii) and (v) theclassical criteria known from Europeanstructural l inguist i~ are used, such asthe diagnostic contexts~ possibility ofcoordination, or Keenan s (1978) criter-ion of the necessary knowledge of thespeaker whether s/he uses an ambiguousitem in this or that of its meanings.It should be noted that perhaps each ofthe criteria has its weak points (oftenthe implications work in one directiononly, xn some cases not only surface fea-tures, but also the tectogrammatical cha-racter of the context has to be taken in-to account, etc.
).Point (iv) can be systematicallytested by means of the so-called dialoguetest (cf.
Haji~ov~ and Panevov~, in press):e.g.
in John came the direction (ratherthan t h e ~  point or the time point)has been deleted, so that the speakernecessarily knows where John came and cananswer such a question (though s/he maynot know from where of when John came).With respect to point (vi) thequestion test or the tests concerningnegation can be used~ as far as the topic--focus articulation is concerned; thuse.g.
in John sent a letter to his SISTERthe verb as well as the Objective areambiguous, since the sentence can (indifferent contexts) answer e.g.
suchquestions as What did John do?
(only Johnbeing include~'in the topic of the answer,all the rest belonging to its focus),W~a% did John send where?
(also the verbbelonging to the topic of the answe@What did John do with the letters?
(aletter rather than the verb being includedin the topic), etc.
; the criterion showsthat John belongs to the topic in allreadin-g~-of the sentence (since John iscontained in all relevant quest ion ,  ifsuch improbable or secondary pairs areexcluded as our sentence answering thequestien What happened?without John re-ferring to one of the most activ--~d ele-ments of the stock of shared knowledge atthe given time point), and that his sisterbelongs to the focus (not occurring inany relevant question).2.
The framework resulting from anapplication of the criteria characterizedin Sect.
I can be briefly outlined asfollows:The elementary units of the under-lying structure are of three kinds:(a) lexical elements (semantic featu-res); in the present paper we do not dealwith operations or relations concerningthe combining of features into more orless complex lexical meanings;(b) elementary gramatical meanings(grammatemes), which can be classifiedas values belonging to various catego-ries or parameters (delimitation, number,tense, aspect, different kinds of moda-lities, etc.
);(c) syntactic elements (functors)such as  Actor ,  Addressee ,  Ins t rument ,D i rec t iona l ,  e tc .The underlyin~ structure of a sen-tence can be concexved of as a network(which can be linearized, see Pl~tek,Sgall and Sgall, in press) the nodesand edges of which are labelled.
A labelof a node consists of a lexical meaningand a combination of ~rammatemes fromdifferent categories (the set of relevantcategories is determined by the word classof the lexical meaning).
A label of anedge consists in a functor, which is in-terpreted either as a Dependency relation,or as one o~ the relations of Coordinati-on (corresponding to the meanings of and,or~ but, etc.)
or of Apposition.
The ~-pendency re--6Iations a re  combined ( in  theunder ly ing  s t ruc ture  o f  a sentencew i thout  coord inat ion  or  appos i t ion)  in toa projective rooted tree, the nodes ofwhich are ordered (from left to right)according to the scale of communicativedynamism, which is decisive for the to-pic-focus articulation of the sentence.The relations of Apposition anS Coordina-tion are combined with those of Depend-ency according to certain rules describedin the last quoted paper and illustratedby Fig.

i points out  how phrasal coord inat ionis handled; in Fig.
2 a configuration oftwo sentence coordinations (wxth dele-tions) appears; Fig.
3 illustrates caseswhere two coordinated nodes have an ex-pansion (relative clause) in common.If interjectional sentences, vocati-ve sentences and pseudosentences consis-ting onl~ in a noun phrase ere not discu-ssed, then it can be stated that the rootof every tree of the mentioned kind islabelled by a symbol the lexical part ofwhich belongs to the word class of verbs.The kinds (and to a certain part also theorder) of the dependency edges going froma node to those dependent on it are de-termined by the valency frame of the go-verning word (included in the lexicalentry of the given lexical meaning).
Thekind of dependency relation are specifiedin two respects,which are relevant fortheir combinatorial properties: (a) theyare classed either as (inner) participants,namely Actor (i.e.
Actor/Bearer, or Tesni-~re ?% premier actant rather than Fill-more s Agentive), Objective, Addressee,Origin and Effect, or as (free) modifica-tions, i.e.
Instrument, Manner, Locative,several kinds of Directional and Temporalmodifications, Cause, Condition (real andirreal), etc.
; (b) they are either obli-atory, or optional.
Every participanthich occurs only with some governingwords, and at most once as dependent onthe same token of the governing word) isincluded in the valency frames of allwords on which it can depend; the freemodifications are the same for all wordsbelonging to the same word class (on thelevel of underlying structures), so thatthey can be listed once for all; onlythose modifications that are obligatorywith a given lexical unit are quoted inits frame.Two specific cases are important forthe empirical investigations: (i) a depe-ndent word present in the underlying stru-cture but deleted in the surface shouldbe distinguished from the absence of the~ iven element on the underlying structure; ii) with the inner participants it isalso necessary to distinguish between theabsence of an (optional) participant anda general participant of the fiven kind(this does not concern only the generalActor ,  typicall~ expressed by ~ne in Eng-lish, but also the Objective, c-~.
Haji~o-v~ and Panevov~, in press).3.
With this approach, the underlyings t ructures  a re  re la t ive ly  c lose  to  thesurface structure of sentences.
This isconnected with the advantages granted bythe universal character of natural langu-age (ensuring that the framework is nottoonarrow and can be generalized if appliedto a larger class of texts, etc.).
On theother hand t with such a framework it isnecessary to use a model of natural langu-age inferencing, if we want the procedureof language understanding to go beyond pu-rely linguistic relationships.
If e.g.
ina question-answering system based on sucha framework not only such answers shouldbe identified that were literally presentin the input text, but also those yieldedby simple (mostly unconscious) inferenc-ing normally carried out by the reader ofthe text, then rules of inference can beadded.
A first tentative set of such rulesis being checked in the experiments withthe system prepared on the basis of themethod TIBAQ in Prague.
These rules rangefrom general ones to more or less idio-syncratic cases concerning the relation-ships between specific words, as well asmodalities, hypo~ym~, etc.24A rather general rule changes e. ~.
astructure of the form (V-act(NAct.r).g.
)into (V-act(DActor(Nlnstr)...) , vwhere V-act is a verb of action, D is adummy (for the general actor) and N is aninanimate noun; thus The negative feed-ba6k can servo the volta6e to zero ischanged into One can serve the voltage tozero by .

A rather specific ruleconnected with a single verb is that chan-ging (use (Spatien t) (XAccomp) .... into(use (X- ~) (Y .
.
.
.  )
...), e.g.
Anop- -e~at i~r~p l i~e~n be used wit~-anegative feedback = With an operationalut~lifier a negative feedback can be used.er similar rules concern t~e divisionof conjunct clauses, the possible omissi-on of an adjunct under certain conditions(i.e.
if not being included in the topic,e.g.
from "It is possible to maintain Xwithout emplcying Y" it follows that itis possible to maintain X), or severalshifts of verbal modalities, asp.
a sen-tence having the main verb with a Possi-bilitive modality (can, may) is derivedfrom a positive deca~tlv~-'6 sentence; insome cases (when the name of a deviceoccupies the posit~n of the Actor of themain verb) also a reverse rule is avai-lable, deriving e.g.
The device X is usedwith a ne6ative feedback from The deviceX can be used with anegat ive  feedback.l~urther rules yield a conjunction or asimilar connection of two statements;e .g .X  is a device with the property Yand X can be applied to handle Z arecombined to yield X is a device %hat hasthe property Y and can be applied to han-~ also explicit definitions (inclu-.g.
the verb call) are identifiedand the inference ru--~ allow for repla-cements of the definiendum by the defini-ens and vice versa in other assertions,Besides these kinds of rules it isnecessary to study (i) rules standingcloser %o inference as known from logic(deriving specific statements from generalones, etc.
), (ii) rules of "typical" (un-marked) consequence as given e.g.
by a sc-ript~ and (iii) rules of "probable conse-quences", e.g.
if John worked hard in theafternoon and he is tired in the evening,then the latter fact probably was causedby the former ~if no other cause was gi-ven in text).
In our experiment of ques-tion answering we do not use these typesof inference, but they will be useful formore general systemS.Another direction in which the systemprobably can be made more flexible concernsthe absence of overt quantifiers and mar-king of their scopes in our underlyingstructures.
One of our next aims consistsin the construction of a procedure trans-ducing the underlying structures into amixed language, which would include meansfor marking quantifiers and their scopes(similarly to many formal languages of lo-gic), while it would share all other as-pects of its structure with the level ofunle~lying representations of natural lan-guage.Colmerauer's Q language is used forthe implementations of the main procedu-res of  the quest ion-answer ing system, sothat e.g.
A(B,C(D,E)) represents a treethe head of which is ~, which has twosister nodes, B, C, the latter being againexpanded by D and E. The tree structureis used in our syntactico-semantic analy-sis of Czech (prepared by J.Panevov~ andK.Oliva) and of English (by Z.Kirschner)to represent the dependency relationbetween nodes.
Due to the fact that Q lan-guage works only with elementary labels,the complex labels of our description haveto be decomposed (i.e.the features andgrammAtemes of individual work forms occu-py similar positions as their daughternodes).
Also the procedures for the app-lication of inference rules and for theidentification of (full and partial orindirect) answers to a question given bythe user (on the basis of the corpus ofinput texts that have been analyzed) areprogrammed in Q language.
The synthesisof Czech and morphemic analysis are im-plemented in PL/I.
For a more general sys-tem the set of inference rules should besubstantially enlarged, and various heur-istics, strategies and filters should beformulated in order to keep the number ofderived assertions in fixed limits.
Forthese aims the experience gained in thefirst experiment will be used.REFERENCESHaji~ov6 E. and J?
