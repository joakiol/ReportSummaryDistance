Nominal Metonymy ProcessingBoyan OnyshkevychUS Department of DefenseFort MeadeMD 20755baonysh@afterlife.ncsc.milAbstract.
We argue for the necessity of resolution of metonymies for nominals (and othercases) in the context of semantics-based machine translation.
By using an ontology as asearch space, we are able to identify and resolve metonymic expressions with significantaccuracy, both for a pre-deterrnined inventory of metonymie types and for previously un-seen cases.
The entity replaced by the metonymy is made explicitly available in our mean-ing representation, to support translation, anaphora, nd other mechanisms.1.
Introduct ionLakoff and Johnson (1980) identify metonymy as "using one entity to refer to another that is related toit."
Following Gibbs (1993), we distinguish metonymy from metaphor in that metonymy uses an entity torefer to another, elated, entity from the same domain, whereas metaphor necessarily relies on the replace-ment of an entity from one domain by an entity from another conceptual domain.
As has been well-estab-lished in the literature, metonymic language use is pervasive in written and spoken language.
NLP effortsaddressing specific orpora, such as Hobbs and Martin (1987), Stallard (1993), and MADCOW (1992), allhad to address metonymic phenomena because of its high frequency.
The training and test data collectedfor this effort (as described below) also found high volumes of metonymy in newswires in English andSpanish.
Our investigation found that the vast majority of all metonymies ncountered involve the substitu-tion of one nominal by another 1,and, given the pervasive nature of the phenomenon, we believe that se-mantic interpretation f nominals in context unavoidably involves metonymic resolution.2.
Why Resolve Metonymy?We find that we need to identify and resolve metonymy during the semantic analysis phase of MachineTranslation for a number of reasons, given below.
(Of course, some of these arguments assume that thegeneration component of the MT system is able to take advantage ofthe additional inferences and informa-tion that is provided as a result of the resolution.)?
The most compelling argument for resolving metonymy as part of the analysis process in MT is thatmetonymies do not necessarily translate literally into other languages.
Although often they dotranslate felicitously, an informal investigation i to the translatability of 15 examples of metonymyeasily found a number of cases where a literal translation would be bizarre, misunderstood, or justill formed.
For example, in The newspaper fwed the editor in chief, the word for newspaper (shin-bun) must be rendered as newspaper company (shinbunsha) to make the example understandablein Japanese.
These results are consistent with the more thorough field work in Karnei and Wakao(1992) and Wakao and Helmreich (1993) on English, Chinese, and Japanese; they cite additionalexamples, uch as He read Mao being unacceptable in Chinese.
Other work by Kayser (1988) andby Horacek (1996) illustrates cases where well-formed metonymies in English are unacceptable inFrench or German.?
In addition to the cases where literal translation of metonymy is unacceptable, there are numerousother examples where the literal translation is understandable ut not fluent.?
The replaced entity may need to be available for anaphoric and other eferential mechanisms.
In the1.
The non-nominal metonymic examples that we encountered, such as spend money used as a metonym forgo shopping, often fall deeply in the grey area between metaphor and metonymy.94utterance The sax has the flu tonight, so the boss docked his pay, the pronoun refers to human (themusician) that the metonym replaced.
Anaphora nd definite reference function in various uniqueways in different languages, o resolution isnecessary for fluent ranslation.?
Agreement mechanisms may reference not the metonymic expression, but the replaced entity, insome examples.
In the saxophone example above, the pronoun agrees with the replaced musician'sgender, not the metonym's.
In Japanese and other languages with counters or classifiers, expres-sions such as six Volvos require the classifier for cars, not for companies.?
Since word sense disambiguation (WSD) mechanisms typicaLly rely on sentential context in someform, unresolved metonymies can cause inaccurate r solution.3.
F ramework  for Metonymy ProcessingThe metonymy identification and resolution mechanism described here is an integral part of the overallsemantic dependency structure-building process (a process that builds the interlingual meaning representa-tion for the input text in a Machine Translation application) in our paradigm, as it is for other applicationsin Hobbs and Martin (1987) or Chamiak and Goldman (1988), as opposed to relegating metonymy pro-cessing to an error-recovery process, as in Fass (1986b).
Because it is an integral part of the word-sensedisambiguation (WSD) process, we gain efficiency and unified control, which has a high payoff because ofthe high prevalence of metonymy in text from real corpora.
The context of this work is the MikroKosmosknowledge-based MT effort; see Onyshkevych and Nirenburg (1995) for discussion of the lexicon and oth-er knowledge in the approach, and see Mahesh et aL (1997) for an overview of the WSD mechanism.Our approach to metonymy resolution for nominals relies on a fundamental observation about metony-my, namely that it reflects (conventional) semantic ontiguity, as described in Gibbs (1993) or Jakobsenand Halle (1956).
The premise of our approach is that relations in our ontology 1 coincide with the relationsof semantic ontiguity at some level, thus the task of the metonymy resolution/WSD process is to identifythe nature of contiguity in each case by identifying the best path in the ontology from the candidate mean-ing of a word to a constraining concept (see Mahesh et al (1997) for a discussion of the richness and spec-ificity of semantic constraints in our approach, which projected an average of 15 constraints on each open-class word in our Spanish test corpus).By relying on the ontology to capture selectional restriction features (instead of the lexicon), and bymaking extensive use of inheritance in the ontology, we find that we can use a very wide range of featuresfor constraining relations; in fact, any of the 7000 concepts in the ontology can serve as constraints, andeact/concept has an average of 14 constrained relations.
Gibbs (1983) identifies that prior context can setup a mutually-understood local referring function: "any given instance of a referring function eeds to besanctioned by a body of beliefs encapsulated in an appropriate frame".
But there are infinite such localcontexts that can generate locally-sanctioned referring functions (all the "ham sandwich" types of metony-mies, for example), thus an unrestricted range of notions of contiguity.
While we aren't able to fully makeuse of context at this stage of development, the metonymy resolution/WSD process can make use of anyontological relation or predicate (event) in establishing a metonymic link.
So any of the 300+ (non-inven-tory) relations in the ontology can all be identified as the contiguity relation and establish the metonymiclink, if they provide the most plausible xplanation for an apparently necessary constraint relaxation (if de-scribing the problem from an abductive inference perspective).1.
Our meaning representation is defined in terms of concepts in an ontology; in addition to the traditionaltaxonomic (IS-A) links, we have an extensive set of other elations between concepts in the ontology,selected from over 300 possible relations.
Currently the ontology consists of about 7000 concept nodes,with an average of 14 (local or inherited) relations from each concept to others in the ontology.
The on-tology may be examined at h t tp  : / / c r l .

References for the ontology are also available at that site.95This approach allows furl use of the relations defined in the ontology.
If only the strict IS-A relationsfrom the ontology were used, with either vertical relaxation of constraints or a relaxation utilizing a smallset of topological relations over a hierarchy (such as Fass 1986, 1988), then the wealth of metonymic ex-pressions would be unprocessable without either allowing excessive ambiguity or not recognizing numer-ous uninventoried xamples of metonymy.
The framework outlined here allows metonymic expressions tobe processed by utilizing semantic onstraint checking and relaxation over the full range of metonymic re-lations, combined with taxonomic generalization; note, however, that not all combinations of relations orarcs in the ontology identify paths of acceptable weights, that is, the arc weight mechanism allows foridentifying varying degrees of acceptability of relations that comprise potential paths between filler andconstraint.Our inventory of raetonymic arcs reflects the types of metonymic relations which have been identified,such as PART.OF for the Part-for-Whole metonymy, LOCATION.OF for the Place-for-Event metonymy,PRODUCTS for the Producer-for-Product metonymy, etc.
Thus for each idendfied metonymy, the arc(s)is found in the ontology that reflects the metonymy in defining the path from the metonym to the con-straint.
For example, in he drove his V8... the constraint on what can be driven is ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE, but the candidate filler is ENGINE (ofa certain type).
The part is the engine, the whole is the ve-hicle, and the arc from ENGINE to ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE is PART-OF; the potential filler is themetonym, and the constraint identifies what is being replaced.
Thus in Producer-for-Product, acandidatefiller (such as Chevrolet) has a certain relation, identified by the metonymic arc (such as PRODUCER.OF),to the constraint, which is what is being replaced (such as an automobile).Thus the metonymy-processing approach described below essentially consists of two steps: a) the ap-plication of the general constraint-satisfaction process (a graph search process over the ontology), and b)identification of the concept hat was replaced by the metonym in the path returned by the graph searchprocess.Run-time processing therefore involves finding the arc or arcs in the ontology that reflect a metonymyin the source text.
Metonymic arcs would be less expensive than the rest of the unmentioned arcs, but moreexpensive than the weights for straightforward constraint satisfaction (i.e., IS-A and INSTANCE.OF).
Yet if astraightforward constraint satisfaction path is found, the metonymic paths need not be pursued, thus notadding to the computational cost.
Once a metonyrnic relation is found by the constraint satisfaction pro-cess, the metonym needs to be represented.
The metonymic relation is represented by a slot on themetonym, which is filled by an instantiation of the concept that he metonyrn replaces.
In other words, if X-for-Y is the metonymy, X is the metonym actually used, and Y is what it replaces, then in addition to in-stantiating X (from the lexical trigger), we also instandate Y, and we connect X and Y with the metonymicarc reflecting the relation.
Since every relation in the ontology has an inverse, X will have a slot FU filledby Y, and Y will have a slot FU "I which is frilled by X.
A specific example of this appears below.The general problem of acquiring the necessary static knowledge to support his approach involvesidentifying the list of metonymic relations, establishing relations in the ontology to reflect hese metonym-ic relations, and assigning weights to these arcs.For some of the metonymic relations (such as Part-for-Whole), the chaining of more than one travers-als of a metonymic arc (such as the PART-OF arc) is acceptable; for others (such as Place-for-Event), wehave a state-transition-table-based mechanism, but which is not described here.4.
Metonymy Processing: An ExampleFor the sentence Lynn drives a Saab, the semandc constraint for the appropriate slot of the appropriatesense of the verb drive would be *ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE.
Yet the potential filler Saab is of type(or a subtype of) *FOR-PROFIT-MANUFACTURING-CORPORATION which is a violation of the con-straint.
The ontological concept *FOR-PROFIT-MANUFACTURING-CORPORATION has a slot PRODUC-ER-OF, which has an "inverse" relation called PRODUCED-BY.
The path which is found by the ontological96search process is (expressed in the \ [SOURCE-NODE OUTGOING-ARC - -> DEST INAT IONNODE\]  notation):ONTOLOGY PATH:\[ FOR-PROFIT-MANUFACTURING-CORP417 PRODUCER-OF - - > "AUTOMOBILE \]\[ 'AUTOMOBILE IS-A - -> "WHEELED-ENGINE-VEHICLE\]\[*WHEELED-ENGINE-VEHICLE I$-A - ->  *ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE\]I f  FOR-PROFIT-MANUFACTURING-CORPORA~ON417 were a concept in the maned endty inventory(with knowledge about Saab Scania AB), i.e., with slot/fillers such as (NAME $SAAB ) ,  (PRODUCER-OF *AUTOMOBILE *JET-AIRCRAFt, the above path would be found.
But even i f  that world knowledgetidbit (about Saab's products) were not available, the path that he ontological search process finds is:ONTOLOGY PATH :\[ FOR-PROFIT-MANUFACTURING-CORP417 PRODUCER-OF - - > *ARTIFACT\]\['ARTIFACT SUBCLASSES - - > *VEHICLE \]\[ 'VEHICLE SUBCLASSES - - > *ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE \]The latter path has a lesser preference (i.e., a greater cost) than the former, because of the more expensivetraversed arcs (SUBCLASSES is always more expensive than IS-A), but illustrates that the mechanism is stillable to identify the metonymy in the absence of the specific product information.Once a path is found (let's assume the latter no-named-entity-inventory case), it is inspected for the ap-pearance of a metonymic relation arc.
If such an arc is found, the inverse of that arc is available in con-structing the final meaning representation f the sentence.
For the above example, the most specificinformation that is available from the path (identifiable by following SUBCLASSES arcs after the metonym-ie arc) is utilized in making an inference about he replaced metonym and instantiating an appropriate con-cept %ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE460 (the TMR is our interlingua or meaning representationlanguage):THR:( DRIVE435(AGENT (VALUE PERSON440) ) ; abbreviated of course( THEME(SEM *ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE)( VALUE(source FOR-PROFIT-MANUFACTURING-CORP417)( in fe rence  in fe rence306 ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE460) ) ) )( PERSON440 ~(NAME $LYNN) )( inference480(TYPE metonymy)( ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE460(MANUFACTURED-BY(VALUE FOR-PROFIT-MANUFACTURING-CORP417) ) ) )( FOR-PROFIT-MANUFACTURING-CORP417(NAME (VALUE $SAAB))(PRODUCER-OF inference480(SEa *ARTIFACT) )(VALUE ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE460)  ) )The in ference  notation used in this example is more generally available to represent inferencesmade by a variety of specialized mechanisms ormicrotheories during the course of semantic analysis.
Thisnotation preserves the original iteral interpretation, while making available the replaced entity that was in-ferred to exist by the metonymy processing mechanism; this inferred information (in this case, the exist-ence of a produced vehicle) satisfies the goals of metonymy resolution mentioned above.97The real challenge to this approach is when the system has no information about he word Saab at all.As a system heuristic, one of the most likely possibilities for an unrecognized word in noun position (par-ticularly if we utilize the English capitalization i formation) is that it is a name for some named entity (i.e.,( NAMED-ENTITY239 (NAME ~ Saab"  ) ) ).
In fact, we can do better by relying on Name Tagging (i.e.,shallow extraction) capabilities that are available for integration i to MT and other NLP applications.
1Name Tagging technology can suggest, with high reliability (93-94%) that the string represents an organi-zation, say ORGANIZATION 240, in which case the path found by the ontological search process is:ONTOI, OGY PATH.
"\[ ORGANIZATION239 INSTANCE-OF - - > *ORGANIZATION \]\['ORGANIZATION PRODUCER-OF --> *ARTIFACTI\[*ARTIFACT SUBCLASSES - - > VEHICLE \]\[*VEHICLE SUBCLASSES - ->  *ENGINE-PROPELLED-VEHICLE\]This path, albeit expensive, is found by the search algorithm; the challenge of this approach is to adjust allof the arc weights to return these weights with fairly low cost relative to other eturned paths.5.
Inventory of Metonymie RelationsAlthough not receiving nearly as much attention i  the literature as metaphor, there have been a few at-tempts in the various literatures to categorize metonyrny into types.
None of the inventories are compre-hensive nough to support the population of a working ontology for use in the analysis of real-world texts.Thus the strategy used by us to build such an inventory consisted of combining multiple sources in the lit-erature, experiments and analysis of corpora, and carefully filtering inventories of other kinds of semanticrelations (e.g., syntagrnatic and paradigmatic lexical relations, meaning change, cognitive meronyrnic clas-sification) for relations that do reflect metonymic use of language in English.As mentioned above, it is not possible to build an exhaustive inventory of metonyrny.
So although thisinventory was compiled for the purpose of seeding the metonymy processing mechanism, it is augmentedwith the mechanism for handling novel or unexpected (i.e., uninventoried) metonymic relations and com-binations (chains) of metonymic relations.We built an inventory of metonymy types based on various sources, spanning theoretical linguistics,lexicography, cognitive science, philosophy of language, and computational linguistics, not necessarilydealing explicitly with metonymy: Apresjan (1974), Fass (1986), Kamei and Wakao (1992), Lakoff andJohnson (1980), Mel'chuk and Zholkovsky (1984), Nunberg (1978), Stem (1965), Winston et al (1987),Yamanashi (1987).
Our inventory consists of about 20 major categories, with another 20 subtypes.We encountered (in various corpora) some examples which seem to fall into multiple categories: TheWhite House announced that.., could be either Symbol-for-Thing-symbolized or Place-for-Occupants.There is also group of alternations that reflect a semantic relation that could be arguably treated as eithermetonymy, regular polysemy (i.e., handled by Lexical Rules in our format or by generative processes inPustejovsky (1995)), or derivational processes, uch as Product-for-Plant orMusic-for-Dance.We need to ensure that he metonymies in the inventory mentioned above are representable y relationsin the ontology, with certain metonymies weeded out for lack of productivity (often because there is only alimited possibility of examples of the metonymy, and those are diachronically lexicalized).
For each met-onymic relation, we identify a relation that is used in the ontology to represent the relation between the ref-erent and the metonym (i.e., from the thing being replaced to the thing that replaces it), along with aninverse relation (which is what actually appears in the path in a filler-to-constraint search).A potential problem with this approach is that triggering conditions may differ from the canonical me-tonymy, where a selectional restriction violation is a clear indicator that some kind of relaxation is neces-1.
Numerous such Name Tagging systems, with accuracy very near human, have been evaluated inthe scopeof the Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) and are described inSundheim (1995).98sary.
In particular, there might not be any selectional restriction violation for some "pragmatic"metonymies, such as I'm going to spend money this a.~ernoon (which, arguably, are actually metaphors).6.
Knowledge Base for Metonymy ProcessingThe knowledge r quired for processing metonymy is not specifically differentiated from the constraintsatisfaction data requirements of the overall processing mechanism.
Those static knowledge r sources do,however, reflect ontology arcs and weights that are used for identifying and resolving metonymy.
Theknowledge acquisition consisted first of identifying the arcs that needed special treatment because they areused in resolving frequently-occurring metonymies, then second by setting weights for those arcs by theautomated training mechanism (using simulated annealing).
The latter part of the task, however, equiredmanually building a training data set.The example below illnstrates the training data.
The example from the corpus is quoted, followed byan enumeration f the metonymy categories ineffect in the example.
The matrix verb is the source of con-stralnts on the metonym in this case, so the concept is listed, along with the constraint that it places on theAGENT role.
The path given in this example needs to be matched by the ontological graph search exactly.

In our experiment, the arc types that receive spe-cial weights are manually specified, and the training mechanism assigns weights.
Itwould have been possi-ble for the training mechanism toassemble the list of arcs, as well, by examining the arcs reflected in thetraining data; one drawback of the latter approach would have been the inability to call out specific arcsthat aren't used in the training data, in expectation f their occurrence inother corpora.First we constructed a data set which essentially reflects an opportunistic collection of metonymies,and is in no way exhaustive or reflective of the distribution of metonymies over a corpus.
Weights wereproduced by a simulated annealing training process; the training was able to produce aset of weights thataccounted for 100% of the training data.
A typical set of such weights is abbreviated below:I S -ASUBCLASSESBAS-MEMBERPRODUCER-OFINSTANCE-OFNAMED- INSTANCE-OF0 .9797270 .7628310 .7874530 .7790021.01.00 .58028The last line reflects the weight used for all arcs not explicitly inventoried.A second training set was produced more systematically from English-language newswire, specifically99the February 9-11 1997 edition of USA Today (bardcopy) and the February 11 1997 edition of the on-lineedition of the Mercury News.After the ontology was augmented as required, new weights were produced by simulated annealing.The annealing run used the same annealing schedule and Cauchy cooling rate, and began by initially "heat-ing" the temperature (by 10 complete randomizing annealing iterations) to an energy of 0.97 (in the inter-val \[0.0, 1.0\]).
The simulated annealing run resulted in final energy of 0.0575, or 94.25% exampleaccuracy (percentage of example sentences correctly analyzed, as compared to metonymic llnk accuracy,where examples with a chain of multiple metonymies count multiple times).
Of the remaining errors (i.e.,metonymic relations not found by the ontological search program), one is unsolvable by the current ap-proach.
The example, Eddie Jones had a hot hand in today's game has no selecfional constraint violations(and is, in fact, understandable and incorrectly acceptable iterally).
1Handling this type of non-literal ex-pression is beyond the scope of the work described here, and would require a substantially different ap-proach.Of the other four examples that were not solvable after training, one is actually ambiguous, and the on-tological search mechanism suggested a reading not supported by context: Fufimori tom Peruvian radiothat.., appeared in a context which suggested that he talked to the nation via radio, vs. talking to the peo-ple in charge of the Peruvian radio service, as the ontological search program suggested.
Two of the otherexamples, Other dinners brought in more money and The dinner is adding to the questions being askedabout fund-raising activities, were incorrectly analyzed as using "dinner" to refer to the people who pre-pared the dinner, not the people who attended the dinner (in the former case); in is unclear how to analyzethe latter of these, which is complicated by ellipsis, so there is no correct answer given in the training data,resulting in an automatic failure.
3The last of the incorrect examples .... will move people from welfare rollsinto jobs, also involves ome metaphorical orelliptical mechanism.

The ta-ble shows that seven kinds of metonymic expressions were found in the four texts, of which Institution-for-PorsonRosponsible (such as companyX announce Y, or in El grupo Roche adquiri6 el laboratorio ...)was the most common, as expected, due to the nature of the texts.
The Action-for-Entity t pe was alsowell-represented, often from the use of "imports" or "exports" to refer to products (since they are repre-sented as the THEME of an event in the lexical semantic specifications:/as importaciones brasile~as total-izaron...) The table also shows a count for various classes of errors in TMR production.
A number of theseerrors are just reflections of missing microtheofies; for example, "millions of dollars" and other numericalexpressions (in Spanish) cause odd TMR constructions that cause trouble when they are linked to other el-ements of the SDS, resulting in type mismatches and.
therefore, metonymic nferences.
Another class ofanomaly is due to temporal expressions, for which no microtheory has been developed, and whose absencecauses funny metonymic expressions toappear in the TMR.
These various missing microtheones accountfor about half of the errors.
It is difficult o pinpoint he cause of errors, so no breakdown of the error typescan be produced; for example, it is difficult o determine whether bad metonymic resolution is the cause orthe effect of bad WSD on open class words or prepositions, informed by a range of other knowledge sourc-es other than the ontological graph search.
Thus many of these rrors, real and apparent, would be elimi-nated by further development of the MikroKosmos ystem that formed the test environment in this case,namely by developing the following microtheofies: numeric expressions, temporal expressions, reificationof case roles, and prepositional semantics.The goal of these experiments was not to attempt to solve all cases of metonymy, but to identify howfar this general mechanism can lead us in addressing metonymies.
In fact, the results are rather promising,in terms of coverage.
A handful of examples are mentioned in above and in this subsection as difficult orimpossible within the framework of the approach described here; however, they seem to account for lessthat five percent of metonymies occurring in real corpora.
Thus we have a model which, as part of a seman-tic interpretation mechanisms, i  able to handle a significant percentage of metonymic usage cases fornominals found in our corpora.1018.
