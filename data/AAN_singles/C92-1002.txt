Martin KAY, President of the ICCLOngoing directions in Computational LinguisticsThis is the fifteenth hlternational Confcrencc onComputational Linguistics.It is arguably the fifteenth COLING, although we onlyadopted the name of a Swedish hobo as our nicknameafter the third meeting.Since tile first n/eeting in 1965, this is only the thirdtime that we have returned to a couutry where wc hadbeen before.
The first time was in 1984, when wereturned to tile United States, arid tile second ill 1988,when we returned to Hungary.
This year we return toFrance, where tile second conference was held in 1967.For those who, like me, have been associated with thesemeetings ince tile beginning, it is a privilege and anenormous pleasure to return to France, and to uconference organized under the auspices of the Universityof Grenoble.
it is too little recognized how much thefield of comlmtational linguistics owes to this countryand to that university.
My predecessor, the secondchairman of the International Committee onComputational Linguistics, the late Professor BernardVauquois and tile machine translation center that hefounded in Greooble, have done more to shape our fieldthan any other single person or center.
They were theonly major academic research group to live through thedark ages that followed the ALPAC report and theirAriune system has become ttle model for the greatmajority of the commercial machine translation systemsthat have ever been built.
Professor Vauquois, and hisstudents and colleagues have been missionaries for, antitireless teachers of, computational linguistics for thirtyyears, establishing new research centers as far away asMalaysia.For a computational linguist, to come here is, ill a veryreal sense, to colne home.In receot years, computational linguistics has beenreturning to its beginuings in some other ways also.Much of tile driving R)rce in our field conies lrom tiledesire to inake u lranslatiug inachine, 0or just becausethis was tile first problem that we attacked, but alsobecause it is a problenl that encompasses ull others - -it is very hard to imagine ally achieveruent that wouldcount as a contribution to computational linguisticswithout contributing to machine translation.But, while it lost noue of its nlotivating force in theinterveoiug years, machine translation receivedsomewhat less attention because the perception has beenthat tile need for nlachine trauslatioo was less than hadoriginally been thought.
Now, tile need is thought o begreater again, and growing.
So, once again, machinetranslatkm, machine-aided translation, and machine aidsfor translators are coming to claim more attention,especially outside the United States.Ill tile early days of conlpututional linguistics, one of tilegreat opportunities that cmnputers seemed to offer wasthat of perftlrmiug nlassive statistical analyses ofrunning text from which it was hoped that much of thehidden structure of language would emerge.
Tile idea IEllinto the background because it became clear that, if sucha program could indeed be carried through, the amouut ofdata that would have to be considered was still beyondthe reach of tile machines and techniques that were thenavailable.he machines are now bigger and faster; orders ofmagnitude more data is readily available in machinetreatable form; and much sharper tools have beendeveloped.
Someone ntering the field of c0mputationallinguistics today will no longer be able to ignores~atishcs and corpus-b,~scd techniques.But, our return to France, MT, and statistics, does notmean that, to quote Yogi Bear, it is just "dejh vu an overagain".
Tile old problems remain unsolved, but therelative naivete, of tile fifties and sixties has been replacedby a notion of appropriate t ctmology - - of (be impactthat can be made on practical matters without havingsolved all the problems necessary for completeautomation.The TAUM-METEO project in Montreal demonstratedclearly and cleanly that we could do useful things withsublanguages that we could not do with unrestrictedlanguages.
Machine translation systems all over tileworld have shown that, when used appropriately, there isvalue in initial translations of altogether lower qualitythat would once have been thought interesting.hlteractive methods have shown us how to profit 1'1"0I\]1tile conlplernentary skills of pcot)le anti lnachiues,allowing each to supply the deficiencies of the other.
Inshort, we have learnt to appro;lch practical problenlswith greater humility and greater realism.These are some of tile reasons that make ule especiallyhappy to welcome yon all to to France, to Nantes, and aweek of excitement a tile 15th hlternatiooal Coofcrence00 Computational Linguistics.Pale Alto, Friday, 8 May 1992ACTI!S DE COLING-92, NAh-rEs, 23-28 AOt~T 1992 4 PRec.
