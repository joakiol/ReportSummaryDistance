K-vec:  A New Approach  for  A l ign ing Paral le l  TextsPascale FungComputer Science DepartmentColumbia UniversityNew York, NY 10027 USAfung@cs.columbia.eduKenneth Ward ChurchAT&T Bell Laboratories600 Mountain Ave.Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USAkwc @research.att.comAbstractVarious methods have been proposed for aligningtexts in two or more languages such as theCanadian Parliamentary Debates (Hansards).
Someof these methods generate a bilingual lexicon as aby-product.
We present an alternative alignmentstrategy which we call K-vec, that starts byestimating the lexicon.
For example, it discoversthat the English word fisheries is similar to theFrench p~ches by noting that the distribution offisheries in the English text is similar to thedistribution of p~ches in the French.
K-vec doesnot depend on sentence boundaries.1.
MotivationThere have been quite a number of recent papers onparallel text: Brown et al(1990, 1991, 1993), Chen(1993), Church (1993), Church et al(1993), Daganet al(1993), Gale and Church (1991, 1993),Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rgsenschein (1993),Klavans and Tzoukermann (1990), Kupiec (1993),Matsumoto (1991), Ogden and Gonzales (1993),Shemtov (1993), Simard et al(1992), Warwick-Armstrong and Russell (1990), Wu (to appear).Most of this work has been focused on Europeanlanguage pairs, especially English-French.
Itremains an open question how well these methodsmight generalize to other language pairs, especiallypairs such as English-Japanese and English-Chinese.In previous work (Church et al 1993), we havereported some preliminary success in aligning theEnglish and Japanese versions of the AWK manual(Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980)), usingcharalign (Church, 1993), a method that looks forcharacter sequences that are the same in both thesource and target.
The charalign method wasdesigned for European language pairs, wherecognates often share character sequences, e.g.,government and gouvernement.
In general, thisapproach doesn't work between languages uch asEnglish and Japanese which are written in differentalphabets.
The AWK manual happens to contain alarge number of examples and technical words thatare the same in the English source and targetJapanese.It remains an open question how we might be ableto align a broader class of texts, especially thosethat are written in different character sets and sharerelatively few character sequences.
The K-vecmethod attempts to address this question.2.
The K-vec AlgorithmK-vec starts by estimating the lexicon.
Considerthe example: fisheries --~ p~ches.
The K-vecalgorithm will discover this fact by noting that thedistribution of fisheries in the English text issimilar to the distribution of p~ches in the French.The concordances for fisheries and p~ches areshown in Tables 1 and 2 (at the end of this paper).
11.
These tables were computed from a small fragment oftheCanadian Hansards that has been used in a number of otherstudies: Church (1993) and Simard et al(1992).
TheEnglish text has 165,160 words and the French text has185,615 words.1096There are 19 instances of fisheries and 21 instancesof p~ches.
The numbers along the left hand edgeshow where the concordances were found in thetexts.
We want to know whether the distribution ofnumbers in Table 1 is similar to those in Table 2,and if so, we will suspect hat fisheries and p~chesare translations of one another.
A quick look at thetwo tables suggests that the two distributions areprobably very similar, though not quite identical.
2We use a simple representation f the distributionof fisheries and p~ches.
The English text and theFrench text were each split into K pieces.
Then wedetermine whether or not the word in questionappears in each of the K pieces.
Thus, we denotethe distribution of fisheries in the English text witha K-dimensional binary vector, VU, and similarly,we denote the distribution of p~ches in the Frenchtext with a K-dimensional binary vector, Vp.
Thei th bit of Vf indicates whether or not Fisheriesoccurs in the i th piece of the English text, andsimilarly, the ith bit of Vp indicates whether or notp~ches occurs in the i th piece of the French text.If we take K be 10, the first three instances offisheries in Table 1 fall into piece 2, and theremaining 16 fall into piece 8.
Similarly, the first 4instances of pgches in Table 2 fall into piece 2, andthe remaining 17 fall into piece 8.
Thus,VT= Vp = <2 0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0 >Now, we want to know if VT is similar to Vp, and ifwe find that it is, then we will suspect that fisheries---> p~ches.
In this example, of course, the vectorsare identical, so practically any reasonablesimilarity statistic ought to produce the desiredresult.3.
fisheries is not file translation of lectionsBefore describing how we estimate the similarity ofVf and Vp, let us see what would happen if we triedto compare fisheries with a completely unrelatedword, eg., lections.
(This word should be thetranslation of elections, not fisheries.)2.
At most, fisheries can account for only 19 instances ofp~ches, leaving at least 2 instances ofp~ches unexplained.As can be seen in the concordances in Table 3,  forK=10, the vector is <1, 1, 0, 1, 1,0, 1, 0, 0, 0>.
Byalmost any measure of similarity one couldimagine, this vector will be found to be quitedifferent from the one for fisheries, and therefore,we will correctly discover that fisheries is not thetranslation of lections.To make this argument a little more precise, itmight help to compare the contingency matrices inTables 5 and 6.
The contingency matrices show:(a) the number of pieces where both the Englishand French word were found, (b) the number ofpieces where just the English word was found, (c)the number of pieces where just the French wordwas found, and (d) the number of peices whereneither word was found.Table 4: A contingency matrixFrenchEnglish a bc dTable 5: fisheries vs. pgchesp~chesfisheries 2 00 8Table 6: fisheries vs. lectionslectionsfisheries 0 24 4In general, if the English and French words aregood translations of one another, as in Table 5, thena should be large, and b and c should be small.
Incontrast, if the two words are not good translationsof one another, as in Table 6, then a should besmall, and b and c should be large.4.
Mutual InformationIntuitively, these statements seem to be true, but weneed to make them more precise.
One could havechosen quite a number of similarity metrics for thispurpose.
We use mutual information:1097prob ( VI, Vp )log2 prob(Vf) prob(Vp )That is, we want to compare the probability ofseeing fisheries and p~ches in the same piece tochance.
The probability of seeing the two words inthe same piece is simply:aprob(Vf, Vp) -  a+b+c+dThe marginal probabilities are:a+bprob(Vf ) -  a+b+c+da+cprob(Vp) = a+b+c+dFor fisheries --~ p~ches, prob(Vf, Vp) =prob(Vf)=prob(Vp) =0.2.
Thus, the mutual information islog25 or 2.32 bits, meaning that the jointprobability is 5 times more likely than chance.
Incontrast, for fisheries ~ lections, prob ( V f, V p ) = O,prob(Vf) =0.5 and prob(Vp) = 0.4.
Thus, themutual information is log 2 0, meaning that the jointis infinitely less likely than chance.
We concludethat it is quite likely that fisheries and p~ches aretranslations of one another, much more so thanfisheries and lections.5.
SignificanceUnfortunately, mutual information is oftenunreliable when the counts are small.
For example,there are lots of infrequent words.
If we pick a pairof these words at random, there is a very largechance that they would receive a large mutualinformation value by chance.
For example, let e bean English word that appeared just once and le t fbea French word that appeared just once.
Then, therea non-trivial chance (-~) that e andf  will appear isin the same piece, as shown in Table 7.
If thisshould happen, the mutual information estimatewould be very large, i.e., logK, and probablymisleading.Table 7:fe 1 00 9In order to avoid this problem, we use a t-score tofilter out insignificant mutual information values.prob ( Vf, Vp ) - prob (Vf) prob ( Vp )t=1 prob(Vf,gp)Using the numbers in Table 7, t=l ,  which is notsignificant.
(A t of 1.65 or more would besignificant at the p > 0.95 confidence level.
)Similarly, if e and f appeared in just two pieces1each, then there is approximately a ~ chance thatthey would both appear in the same two pieces, andthen the mutual information score would be quitelog, ,  ~--, but we probably wouldn't believe it high,Z.because the t-score would be only "~-.
By thisdefinition of significance, we need to see the twowords in at least 3 different pieces before the resultwould be considered significant.This means, unfortunately, that we would rejectfisheries --+ p~ches because we found them in onlytwo pieces.
The problem, of course, is that wedon't have enough pieces.
When K=10, theresimply isn't enough resolution to see what's goingon.
At K=100, we obtain the contingency matrixshown in Table 8, and the t-score is significant(t=2.1).Table 8:K=100p~chesfisheries 50194How do we choose K?
As we have seen, if wechoose too small a K, then the mutual informationvalues will be unreliable.
However, we can onlyincrease K up to a point.
If we set K to aridiculously large value, say the size of the Englishtext, then an English word and its translations arelikely to fall in slightly different pieces due torandom fluctuations and we would miss the signal.For this work, we set K to the square root of thesize of the corpus.K should be thought of as a scale parameter.
If weuse too low a resolution, then everything turns intoa blur and it is hard to see anything.
But if we usetoo high a resolution, then we can miss the signal if7098it isn't just exactly where we are looking.Ideally, we would like to apply the K-vec algorithmto all pairs of English and French words, butunfortunately, there are too many such pairs toconsider.
We therefore limited the search to pairsof words in the frequency range: 3-10.
Thisheuristic makes the search practical, and catchesmany interesting pairs)6.
ResultsThis algorithm was applied to a fragment of theCanadian Hansards that has been used in a numberof other studies: Church (1993) and Simard et al(1992).
The 30 significant pairs with the largestmutual information values are shown in Table 9.As can be seen, the results provide a quick-and-dirty estimate of a bilingual exicon.
When the pairis not a direct translation, it is often the translationof a collocate, as illustrated by acheteur ~ Limitedand Santd -~ Welfare.
(Note that some words inTable 9 are spelled with same way in English andFrench; this information is not used by the K-vecalgorithm).Using a scatter plot technique developed by Churchand Helfman (1993) called dotplot, we can visulizethe alignment, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Thesource text (Nx bytes) is concatenated to the targettext (Ny bytes) to form a single input sequence ofNx+Ny bytes.
A dot is placed in position i,jwhenever the input token at position i is the sameas the input token at position j.The equality constraint is relaxed in Figure 2.
Adot is placed in position i,j whenever the inputtoken at position i is highly associated with theinput token at position j as determined by themutual information score of their respective K-vecs.
In addition, it shows a detailed, magnifiedand rotated view of the diagonal line.
Thealignment program tracks this line with as muchprecision as possible.3.
The low frequency words (frequency less then 3) wouldhave been rejected anyways as insignificant.Table 9: K-vec resultsFrench English3.2 Beauce Beauce3.2 Comeau Comeau3.2 1981 19813.0 Richmond Richmond3.0 Rail VIA3.0 p~ches Fisheries2.8 Deans Deans2.8 Prud Prud2.8 Prud homme2.7 acheteur Limited2.7 Communications Communications2.7 MacDonald MacDonald2.6 Mazankowski Mazankowski2.5 croisi~re nuclear2.5 Sant6 Welfare2.5 39 392.5 Johnston Johnston2.5 essais nuclear2.5 Universit6 University2.5 bois lumber2.5 Angus Angus2.4 Angus VIA2.4 Saskatoon University2.4 agriculteurs farmers2.4 inflation inflation2.4 James James2.4 Vanier Vanier2.4 Sant6 Health2.3 royale languages2.3 grief grievance7.
ConclusionsThe K-vec algorithm generates a quick-and-dirtyestimate of a bilingual exicon.
This estimate couldbe used as a starting point for a more detailedalignment algorithm such as word_align (Dagan etal, 1993).
In this way, we might be able to applyword_align to a broader class of languagecombinations including possibly English-Japaneseand English-Chinese.
Currently, word_aligndepends on charalign (Church, 1993) to generatea starting point, which limits its applicability toEuropean languages since char_align was designedfor language pairs that share a common alphabet.ReferencesAho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980) "The AWKProgramming Language," Addison-Wesley,Reading, Massachusetts, USA.1099IFigure 1: A Dotplot of the Hansards::.
