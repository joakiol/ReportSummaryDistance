the DARPA-sponsored TIPSTER programme(\[2\])--and, m parUcular, the message understanchng con-ferencces (MUC e g \[6\] and \[I\])--have prowded fertileground for such work, by placing the emphams of doc-ument analysm to the ldentdlca~on a d extracfaon of cer-tain core entttms and facts m a document, which are"packaged" together m a template There are shared mtu-lttons among researchers that generaUon of smooth prosefrom thts template would ymld a summary of the docu-ment's core content, recent work, most notably by McK-eown and colleagues (cf \[21\]), focuses on making thesemtul~ons more concreteWhile prowdmg arich context for research m genera-tlon, this framework requires an analysm front end capa-ble of mstantmtmg a template to a statable l vel of detailGiven the current state of the art m text analysm  gen-eral, and of semanttc and discourse processing mpartmu-lar (Sparck Jones, \[27\] and \[28\], discusses the depth of un-derstanding requtred for constructing true summaries),work on template-driven, k owledge-based summansa-bon to date m hardly domain- or gen~mdependentThe alternative framework largely escapes thts con-stramt, by vmwmg the task as one of Identifying cer-tain passages (typmally sentences) whtch, by some met-nc, are deemed to be the most representatwe of the doc-umant's content The techmque dates back at least o the50% (Luhn, \[17\]), but it is relattvely recently that theseideas have been filtered through research wath stronglypragmatm constraints, for instance what kinds of docu-ments are ophmally suited for being "abstracted" m sucha way (e g Preston and Wllhams \[23\], Rau et a/\[25\]), howto derive more representattve sconng fimctlons (e g forcomplex documents, uch as multi-topic ones, Salton etal \[26\], or where training

chunks, Paine (\[22\]), or with optnnal pres~-taUons of such passage xtracts, armed at retaining somesense of larger and/or  global context (Mahesh \[18\])The cost of avoiding the requirement for a language-aware front end ts the complete lack of intelligence oreven context-awareness--at the back end the vahdlty,and uttht~ of sentence- or paragraph-sEed xtracts asrepresentahons for the document

technol-ogy Frost, we explain more concretely what we mean by"segment of text", why segments are nnportant, end howthey are detemuned Second, we present a method fordetermining salience which, when apphed to arbitrarysets of phrasal umts, generates an ordering that accu-rately represents he relabve pronunence ofthe objects re-ferred to m a document We also descnbe what hngmshcmformatmn, available through scalable and robust den- 'tlficatmn technologies, can be leveraged to reform sucha nobon of sahence Finally, we give an over~ew of ahngmslac processing envaronment wluch, w~ule carryingout these tasks, remains open-ended wRh respect to thelanguage, domain, style and genre of the texts we wantto be able to handle3.1 Discourse segmentationThe example m Sechon I illustrates the anportance ofdis-course segmentataon As R happens, the htle m this caseworks as an overvaew of the content of the passage be-cause the text Rself Is fmrly short As a text increasesm length, the "completeness" of a short descrlpbon asa charactensahon f content deteriorates If the mten-bon Is to use concise descnphons consmbng of one ortwo topical phrases (topic stamps) plus modlficataonaland relalaonal mformatmn as the primary mformahon-bearing umts for capsule oversnew, then it follows thattexts longer than (roughly) one to three paragraphs mustbe broken down mto smaller umts or segments.The approach to segmentation we adopt mplementsa s~mdanty-based algorithm along the hnes of the one de-veloped by Hearst \[8\], which ldenl~hes topically coherentsections of text using a lex~cal smulanty measure In thefinal presentation of results, each segment ms assoaatedwith a concmse, phrasal-based descnptmn of ~ts contentw~thout loss of accuracy The set of such descnptwns,ordered according to linear sequencing of the segmentsm the text, may then be used as the basis for a capsuleoverview The problem of content charactensatzon of alarge text, then, ms reduced to the problem of finding topicstamps for each segment m the document3.2 Local salienceAs noted m Section 2 2, the set of expressions generatedby extended phrasal analysms typically contains anumberof anaphonc expresmons--pmnouns, reduced descrip-tions, ere--which must be resolved Our anaphora res-olutzon algorithm m based on a procedure developedby Lappm and Leass \[16\], and Is described m detailm Kennedy and Boguraev \[13\], \[14\], m essence, ~t de-velops an adaptation for denying rehable interpretationfrom conmderably shallower hngmstxc analysts of the m-put We make the snnphfymg assumption that everyphrase identified by extended phrasal analysts consti-tutes a "mentmn" of a participant rathe chscourse (seeMare and MacnuUan \[19\] for chscusszon of the notionof "mention" rathe context of proper names interpreta-tion ) Coreference Is represented by eqmvalence classesof nominals, where each eqmvalence dass corresponds toa umque referent m the dmscourse The set of such eqmva-lence classes constitutes the referent set dmcussed aboveHowever, anaphora resolutwn ms nnportant not onlyfor reducing the extended phrase set, ~t also plays a cru-cml role m the ~dent~flcat~on of topic stamps The rea-son thins ms so ms that ~t ms based on a strict defxut~on ofthe notwn of sahence Roughly spealang, an antecedentfor an anaphonc expressmn is located by first ehnunatmgall mmposmble can&date antecedents, then ranking theremaining candidates according to a'Iocal sahence mea-sure, and selecting the most sahent candidate as the an-tecedent Local sahence ms a funcct~on of how a canch-date satmsfles a set of grammatical, syntactic, and con-textual parameters Following Lappm and Leass, we  re-fer to these constraints as "sahence factors" Ind~wdual"sahence factors are associated with numerical values, asfollows 4SENT 100 Iff the expressmn ts m the current sentenceCNTX ,50 df the expresmon Is m the current discourse segmentSUBJ 80 df the expresslon ts a subjectEXST

increases ac-cording to the frequency with which new members areadded to the eqmvalence lass to which it belongs Whenan anaphonc hnk ms estabhshed, the anaphorms addedto the eqmvalence class to which its antecedent belongs,and the sahence of the class ms boosted accordingly If areferent ceases to be mentioned m the text, however, ~tslocal sahence ms mcrementaUy decreased .3.3 Discourse sal ienceCorts!der again the news article dmscussed mSection 1 In-tmtlvely, the reason why 'priest" ms at the focus of the talems that there are no less than eight references tothe sameactor m the body of
