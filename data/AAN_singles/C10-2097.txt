The proposed approach uses Per-sian and English corpora as well as a bi-lingual dictionary in order to make amapping between PWN synsets and Per-sian words.
Our method calculates a scorefor each candidate synset of a given Per-sian word and for each of its translation,it selects the synset with maximum scoreas a link to the Persian word.
The manualevaluation on selected links proposed byour method on 500 randomly selectedPersian words, shows about 76.4% quali-ty respect to precision measure.
By aug-menting the Persian WordNet with theun-ambiguous words, the total accuracyof automatically extracted Persian Word-Net is about 82.6% which outperformsthe previously semi-automated generatedPersian WordNet by about 12.6%.1 IntroductionIn Natural Language Processing (NLP) wide cov-erage lexical databases are used in different areasuch as information retrieval and cross-languageinformation retrieval.
WordNet is an example fora lexical database that groups words into sets ofsynonyms and categorizes them in four categories:noun, verb, adjective and adverb and recordsvarious relations between synonym sets.
A broadoverview of the different PWN applications suchas "Machine Translation", "Information Retriev-al", "Document Classification", "Query Answer-ing" and "Conceptual Identification" have beenpresented in (Morato et al, 2004).PWN was created and maintained since 1990s.After this WordNet for other languages havebeen under development and new projects startevery year.
PWN database contains about 150000words organized in over 115000 synsets.Manual construction of WordNet is a timeconsuming task and requires linguistic know-ledge.
A number of automatic methods were pro-posed for constructing WordNet for other lan-guages that use PWN and other existing lexicalresources.
In order to help the development ofWordNets for other languages rather than English,especially for European one, a project named Eu-roWordNet was found (Vossen, 1999), in which anumber of automatic methods for construction ofsuch databases were proposed (Farreres et al,1998).There have been some other efforts to create aWordNet for Persian language (Famian, 2007;Rouhizadeh et al, 2008; Shamsfard, 2008) butthere exists no Persian WordNet yet that coversall Persian words in dictionary and comparablewith PWN.
These projects have tried to constructPersian WordNet in the manually or semi auto-matic manner.
In (Shamsfard, 2008) a semi au-tomatic method is proposed in which for eachPersian word a number of PWN synsets are sug-gested by system in order to be supervised by ahuman annotator to select a relevant synset.Based on experiments mentioned by Shamsfard(2008), the proposed WordNet extracted automat-ically by the system, retrieved about 70% accura-cy.In this paper a fully automatic method for con-structing a large-scale Persian WordNet fromavailable resource such as PWN, MRDs and cor-pora has been proposed.
Our approach uses dif-ferent word similarity metrics like mutual infor-mation and WordNet similarity to map Persianwords to appropriate PWN synsets.2 Related WorksIn the related field of automatic and semiautomatic WordNet construction, several efforts846have been made.
In (Shamsfard, 2008) a semiautomatic method has been used for developing alexical ontology called FarsNet for Persianlanguage.
About 1500 verbs and 1500 nouns havebeen gathered manually to make WorldNet'score.
Then some heuristics and Word SenseDisambiguation (WSD) methods have been usedto find the most likely related Persian synsets.According to the first heuristic, a Persian wordhas only one synset if it?s be translated to a singleEnglish word.
In this case no ambiguity exists forthe Persian word whose one of synsets will beequivalent with that of English word.
In othercases, second heuristic is used: if two translationsof a Persian word have only one common synsetthen for the Persian word this common synset isselected.
The existence of a single commonsynset in fact implies the existence of a singlecommon sense between the two words andtherefore their Persian translations shall beconnected to this synset (Shamsfard, 2008).
Forwords whose English translations have more thanone synset and second heuristic cannot find theappropriate synset, WSD methods have beenused to select correct synset.
For each candidatesynset, a score is calculated using the measure ofsemantic similarity and synset gloss words.Manual evaluation of the proposed automaticmethod in this research shows 70% correctnessand covers about 6500 Entries on WordNet.In (Sathapornrungkij and Pluempitiwiriyawej,2005) a semi-automatic approach has beendescribed to construct the Thai WordNet lexicaldatabase from WordNet and LEXiTRONmachine readable dictionaries.
Thai WordNetsynsets have been derived from the PWN.
Thecandidate links between Thai words and synsetshave been derived from semantic links which areobtained from WordNet and the translation linkswhich are obtained from LEXiTRON.
In order toderive links between Thai words and PWNsynsets, 13 criteria have been used which arecategorized into three groups: monosemic,polysemic and structural criteria.
Monosemiccriteria focus on an English word which has onlyone meaning.
Such English word has one synsetin PWN.
Polysemic criteria focus on an Englishword which has multiple meaning.
Such Englishword has multiple synset in PWN.
Structuralcriteria focus on the structural relations amongsynsets with respect to WordNet 1.7.
In order toverify links that constructed using these 13criteria, stratified sampling technique has beenapplied and for each criterion 400 links have beenverified manually.
The results of verificationshow that the best criterion has 92% correctnessand the lowest correctness is equal 49.25%.In PWN, there is a gloss for each synset thatcan be used in automatic WordNet construction.In (Kaji and Watanabe, 2006) this informationhas been used for automatic construction ofJapanese WordNet.
Given an English synset, itcalculates the score for each of its Japanesetranslation candidates according to the glossappended to the synset.
A pair of words is calledassociated if mutual information between them belarger than a threshold.
The score is defined asthe sum of correlations between the translationcandidate and the associated words appearing inthe gloss.
Whereas availability of bilingualcorpora is limited, for calculating pair wisecorrelation between the Japanese translations ofan English word and its associated words aniteratively approach has been proposed thatcalculate this correlation without using bilingualcorpora.In (Lee et al, 2000) a set of automatic WSDtechniques have been described for linkingKorean words collected from a bilingual MRD toPWN synsets.
For a given synset, 6 individualheuristic scores are calculated and then a decisiontree is used to combine these scores to classifythe synset as linking or discarding.
In order tomake the decision tree, a set of synsets have beenlabeled manually as linking or discarding andcorresponding heuristic scores have beencalculated and then used for training data set.
Toevaluate the accuracy of proposed method thecandidate synsets of 3260 senses of Koreanwords have been classified manually as linking ordiscarding.
This test set has been used tocalculate precision of each heuristic.
The resultsof experiments show that the precision of allheuristics is better than random mapping and thebest heuristic have 75.21% precision.
Thecombination of heuristics using decision treeshows 93.59% precision.3 Automatic Persian WordNet Con-structionEach Persian word can have several Englishtranslations and each English translation has also847several PWN synsets.
For a given Persian word, abilingual dictionary is used to extract Englishequivalent words, and then a set of candidatesynset is generated using PWN that contains allsynsets of English translations of Persian word.As in (Shamsfard, 2008), if the English transla-tion of a given Persian word has only one synsetin PWN, then the Persian word is linked to thisPWN synset directly, or if for a candidate synsetat least two English translations belong to it, thenPersian word is linked to this PWN synset.In other cases, a score is calculated for eachremaining candidate synset and the synset withmaximum score is selected as an appropriate syn-set of the Persian word.
Note that after selecting asynset, all synsets that share English words areremoved from candidate synsets.The following resources have been used in theprocess of score calculation:x PWN: synset words, synset definitionand hypernymy relations have been used.x Bilingual dictionary (Persian ?
English)x Raw Persian text corpus for extractingrelated words of a given Persian wordx Raw English text corpus for extractingmutual information between EnglishwordsText corpora have been used to extract the re-lated words of any given word.
To do this, Mu-tual Information (MI) metric between any wordsin corpus and given Persian word are calculatedand n-best words with higher MI values are se-lected.
Mutual Information of pair x and x?
isdefined as follows:?)?
?, ??)
=?
(?, ??)?(?)
?
?(??)?
?
(1)In formula 1, n(x, x?)
is co-occurrence fre-quency of x and x?
in corpus.
This frequency iscalculated using a window with specific size.
n(x)is the frequency of word x in corpus and N is thenumber of unique words in corpus.So, in order to select the most related words for agiven Persian word, an additional step is consi-dered.
For each Persian word w, other relatedPersian words with highest mutual informationare selected and considered as a set R = {r1, r2, ?,rn}.
Then for each Persian word ri a similarprocess is used and a set of words is extractedthat is called Ri.
If Ri contains the word w, then riis selected as the related word for w and other-wise discarded.After extracting the related words of the givenPersian word, a Persian to English dictionary hasbeen used to find equivalent translation of eachrelated word.
These words are referred as RelatedTranslation Set (RTS).
In scoring algorithmwords that appear in gloss of each synset andwords that appear in hypernym synset are calledGloss Words (GW).
These words are consideredas related words to the candidate synset and dis-tinguish each synset from other.Now for each candidate synset of a given Per-sian word a score is calculated that is based onthe idea that two related words in the two-sidelanguages share the same words in the correlationset.
That is, if Persian word w relates to Englishsynset e, then other co-related Persian words r1,r2, ?, rn which have gotten the best MI respect tow, should be related to the same synset e again.Based on the above notion, the score of eachcandidate synset S can be estimated as follow:?????(?)
=?
?
???(??
, ?)
?
??)??
, ??)???????????
(2)The score of synset S is defined as summationon product of semantic similarity between wordsin RTS and synset S, and mutual information be-tween words in RTS and words in GW.
In (Pe-dersen et al, 2004) several methods for calculat-ing semantic similarity based on WordNet'sstructure have been presented.
Some of these me-thods are based on path lengths between conceptsand some of them are based on information con-tent.
One of these methods is named path inwhich for each word w and synset s is defined asinverse of shortest path length between any syn-set of w and s. In our experiments the measurepath has been used and calculated using formula3.???
(?, ?)=1minsi?

, ?
))(3)In formula 2 the words from RTS which has lesssimilarity to synset s has little effect on theamount of score in synset.8484 Experiments and EvaluationsPersian WordNet constructor components areWord Translator, Related Word Extractor, SynsetExtractor and Synset Selector.
Persian words andtheir selected synsets are input and output of thissystem.
Persian word is given as input to theWord Translator and Related Word Extractorcomponents.
In our experiment, 10 words withhighest MI to the given Persian word are ex-tracted using Related Word Extractor.
For thispurpose, 3000 documents of IRNA 1 newspapertext corpus have been used.
IRNA is a newsagency published their news on different lan-guages, mainly on Persian.
In order to count thenumber of co-occurrences of words x and x?, awindow with the size of 20 words was considered.Translations of related words and candidate syn-sets are given to Synset Selector and appropriatesynsets for the given Persian word are selected.In this step PWN is used for semantic similaritycalculation and an English text corpus (USENETcorpus) is used to calculate mutual information.Table 1 shows the number of words and docu-ments in the Persian and English text corpora.About 30698 Persian words from Aryanpour 2Persian to English dictionary has been used forconstructing Persian WordNet.Num of docu-mentsNum of UniqueWordsPersian 3000 32197English 3000 32899Table 1: number of documents and uniquewords in Persian and English corpusesAs it was mentioned in the previous section,Persian words were linked to PWN synsets in thetwo different ways.
Some links was selected di-rectly without calculating their score by usingsome heuristics.
We call these links as unambi-guous links.
Some of these links are shown intable 2.
As it shown in the table, unambiguouslinks are wrong in some cases.
For example in thecase of '<barchasb>tag', a verb synset is selectedwhile the Persian word is noun, so the selection isjudged as incorrect.
If the part of speech tag in-formation of word is used in this example thecorrect synset would be selected.1 Islamic Republic News Agency (http://www.irna.ir)2 http://www.aryanpour.com/Another type of links are ambiguous links, inwhich a scoring method is used for selecting theappropriate synset.
Examples of these links areshown in table 3.
As it?s shown in the table, theword '<karmozd>commission' has been linked to6th sense of word 'commission' that is wrong.
Inconstructed Persian WordNet alo word'<farman>commission' has been linked to thissense of word 'commission' but the word'<karmozd>commission' and the word'<farman>commission' have less similarity to-gether.
In this example link between'<farman>commission' and 6th sense of word'commission' is an unambiguous link.
Thereforewe can avoid of selecting this synset for'<karmozd>commission' using this information.In order to evaluate the quality of the selectedlinks, 500 Persian words have been randomlyselected and the accuracy of selected synsets hasbeen evaluated manually.
Table 4 summarizes theresults of this evaluation.
As it?s shown in thetable, the precision of unambiguous links is about95.8% while this precision is 76.4% for the am-biguous links.
The weighted average precision ofthe whole links in our automatically generatedPersian WordNet is 82.6%, which outperformsthe only comparable semi-automated PersianWordNet which was previously presented by(Shamsfard, 2008), about 12.5%.
Also, by com-paring the PWN coverage rate of these PersianWordNets, it reveals that our result covered29716 entries on PWN which it is about 4 timesmore than the previously generated PersianWordNet.PrecisionUnambiguous links 95.8%Ambiguous links 76.4%All links 82.6%Table 4: accuracy of selected links for500 wordsThe experimental results reveal that in PWNthere is a short gloss for some synsets whichmakes the calculated score for those synsets to belower than other candidate synsets of a given Per-sian word.
This problem can be overcome bynormalizing the scores of candidate synset of agiven Persian word, i.e.
by dividing the score ofeach synset by the number of words in GW.
An-other solution of this problem is proposed by(Kaji and Watanabe, 2006).
In (Kaji and Wata-849Persian word English translation Selected synset GlossCorrect/incorrect<mosen>agedaged, elderly, old aged, elderly people who are old collectively correct<barchasb>tagtag, label, mark tag, label, mark attach a tag or label to incorrectTable 2: Examples of unambiguous linksPersianwordEnglishtranslationSelected synset GlossCorrect/incorrect<enteshar>publicationpublication publicationthe communication of something to the pub-lic; making information generally knowncorrect<karmozd>commissioncommissioncommission, charge,directiona formal statement of a command or injunc-tion to do somethingincorrectTable 3: Examples of ambiguous linksnabe, 2006), the gloss is given as a query totext retrieval engine and the words that appearas the answer of this query are used instead ofthe words of gloss.
In our experiments, the firstsolution is  chosen which retrived the resultsshown in table 4.5 ConclusionThis paper explored a method for automati-cally linking WordNet synsets to Persian wordsusing pre-existing lexical resources such as Per-sian and English text corpora and PWN.
Theproposed method calculates a score for eachcandidate synset of a given Persian word andselects the synset with maximum score to belinked to the Persian word.
This score is calcu-lated considering related words of Persian wordand words that appear in gloss of synset.
A pre-liminary experiment shows that this method canbe used to construct Persian WordNet.
In theproposed method for each Persian word synsetswith maximum calculated score are selectedwithout considering other Persian words.
In fu-ture work we intend to adapt our method andcontribute other Persian word in order to select asynset for a given Persian word.ReferencesAlexin, Z., Csirik, j., Szarvas, G., Kocsor, A.,Mih?ltz, M. (2006).
