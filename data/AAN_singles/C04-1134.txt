BiFrameNet: Bilingual Frame Semantics Resource Construction byCross-lingual InductionPascale Fung and Benfeng ChenHuman Language Technology Center,University of Science & Technology (HKUST),Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong{pascale,bfchen}@ee.ust.hkAbstractWe present a novel automatic approach toconstructing a bilingual semantic network?theBiFrameNet, to enhance statistical andtransfer-based machine translation systems.BiFrameNet is a frame semantic representation,and contains semantic structure transfersbetween English and Chinese.
The EnglishFrameNet and the Chinese HowNet provide uswith two different views of the semanticdistribution of lexicon by linguists.
We proposeto induce the mapping between the Englishlexical entries in FrameNet to Chinese wordsenses in HowNet, furnishing a bilingualsemantic lexicon which simulates the ?conceptlexicon?
supposedly used by human translators,and which can thus be beneficial to machinetranslation systems.
BiFrameNet alo containsbilingual example sentences that have the samesemantic roles.
We automatically induceChinese example sentences and their semanticroles, based on semantic structure alignmentfrom the first stage of our work, as well asshallow syntactic structure.
In addition to itsutility for machine-aided and machinetranslations, our work is also related to thespatial models proposed by cognitive scientistsin the framework of artifactual simulations ofthe translation process.1.
IntroductionThe merits of translation at the word level orthe concept level have long been a cause for debateamong linguists.
Some linguists suggest that the twolanguages of a bilingual speaker share a commonsemantic system (Illes and Francis 1999; Ikeda 1998)and hence translation is carried out at the conceptlevel.Meanwhile, there has been a gradualconvergence of statistical and transfer approaches inmachine translation recently (Wu 2003).
StatisticalMT systems are based on a stochastic mappingbetween lexical items, assuming the underlyingsemantic transfer is hidden.
Transfer systems useexplicit lexical, syntactic and semantic transfer rules.Consequently, cognitive scientists andcomputational linguists alike have been interested inthe study of semantic mapping between languages(Ploux and Ji, 2003, Dorr et al, 2002, Ngai et al,2002, Boas 2002, Palmer and Wu, 1995).
Wepropose to automatically construct a bilingual lexicalsemantic network with word sense and semantic rolemapping between English and Chinese, simulatingthe ?concept lexicon?, suggested by cognitivescientists, of a bilingual person.Figure 1.
BiFrameNet lexicon and examplesentence inductionThe linguists-defined ontologies?-FrameNet(Baker et al, 1998), HowNet (Dong and Dong,2000), and bilingual dictionaries are the basis for theinduction of the mapping.
We automatically estimatethe semantic transfer likelihoods between EnglishFrameNet lexical entries and the Chinese wordsenses in HowNet, and align those frames andlexical pairs with high likelihood values.
In addition,we propose to induce Chinese example sentencesautomatically to match English annotated sentencesprovided in the FrameNet.
The BiFrameNet thusinduced provides an additional resource formachine-aided or machine translation systems.
It canalso serve as a reference to be compared to cognitivestudies of the translation process.

BiFrameNet ontology inductionPloux and Ji, (2003) proposed a spatial model formatching semantic values between French andEnglish.
Palmer and Wu (1995) studied the mappingof change-of-state English verbs to Chinese.
Dorr etal.
(2002) described a technique for the constructionof a Chinese-English verb lexicon based on HowNetand the English LCS Verb Database (LVD).
Theycreated links between HowNet concepts and LVDverb classes using both statistics and a manuallyconstructed ?seed mapping?
of thematic classesbetween HowNet and LVD.
Ngai et al (2002)employed a word-vector based approach to create thealignment between WordNet and HowNet classeswithout any manual annotation.
Boas (2002) outlineda number of issues surrounding the planning anddesign of GermanFrameNet (GFN), a bilingualFrameNet dictionary which, when complete, willhave a corpus-based German lexicon following theFrameNet structure.2.1.
FrameNet and HowNetThe Berkeley FrameNet database consists offrame-semantic descriptions of more than 7000English lexical items, together with examplesentences annotated with semantic roles (Baker et al,1998).
There is currently no frame semanticrepresentation of Chinese.
However, the ChineseHowNet (Dong and Dong 2000) represents ahierarchical view of lexical semantics in Chinese.This paper is organized as follows: Section 2describes the algorithm for estimating transferrelations between FrameNet and HowNet structures.Section 3 presents our method for selectingBiFrameNet example sentences for a particularframe and automatically inducing semantic roleannotations.
We conclude in Section 4, followed bya discussion in Section 5.FrameNet is a collection of lexical entries groupedby frame semantics.
Each lexical entry represents anindividual word sense, and is associated withsemantic roles and some annotated sentences.Lexical entries with the same semantic roles aregrouped into a ?frame?
and the semantic roles arecalled ?frame elements?.
For example:Frame: Cause_harmFrame Elements: agent, body_part, cause, event,instrument, iterations, purpose, reason, result,victim?..Lexical Entries:bash.v, batter.v, bayonet.v, beat.v, belt.v,bludgeon.v, boil.v, break.v, bruise.v, buffet.v,burn.v,?.Example annotated sentence of lexical entry?beat.v?
:[agent I] lay down on him and beat [victim at him][means with my fists].2.
Lexical semantic mapping in BiFrameNetDorr et al (2002) uses a manual seed mapping ofsemantic roles between FrameNet and LVD toinduce a bilingual verb lexicon.
In this paper, wepropose a method of automatically mapping theEnglish FrameNet lexical entries to HowNetconcepts, resulting in the BiFrameNet ontology.
Wealso make use of two bilingual English-Chineselexicons for this induction.
In this section 2, we usean example FrameNet lexical entry ?beat.v?
in the?cause_harm?
frame to illustrate the main steps ofour algorithm.HowNet is a Chinese ontology with a graphstructure of word senses called ?concepts?, and eachconcept contains 7 fields including lexical entries inChinese, English gloss, POS tags for the word inChinese and English, and a definition of the conceptincluding its category and semantic relations (Dongand Dong, 2000).
For example, one translation for?beat.v?
is ?
:In this work, we make use of contextual lexicalentries from the same semantic frame, as illustratedabove.
In this example, the ?cause_harm?
framecontains two lexical entries??beat.v?
and ?strike.v?.From the previous step, ?beat.v?
and ?strike.v?
iseach linked to a number of Chinese candidates.?beat.v?
is linked to ???
with membership in twodifferent HowNet categories, namely ??|beat?
and?
??
|associate?.
To disambiguate between theabove these 2 candidate categories, we make use ofthe other lexical entries in ?cause_harm?, in this case?strike.v?
which is linked to ??
?,  in the ?
?|beat?HowNet category.
Now, ?
|beat?
receives two votes(from ?
?
and from ?
?
), and ?
|associate?
onlyone (from ?
?).
We therefore choose the HowNetcategory ?
|beat?
to be aligned to the frame?cause_harm?, and eliminate the sense of ??
?in the?
?
?
|associate?
category.
Consequently,?beat.v?
in ?cause_harm?
is linked to all HowNetconcepts that are translations of ?beat?
which areverbs, and which also belong to the HowNet category?
|beat?
(but not ?
|associate?).NO.

?Whereas HowNet concepts correspond roughly toFrameNet lexical entries, its semantic relations do notcorrespond directly to FrameNet semantic roles.2.2.
Initial mapping based on bilingual lexicon(step 1)We use the bilingual lexicon from HowNet andLDC dictionary to first create all possible mappingsbetween FrameNet lexical entries and HowNetconcepts whose part-of-speech (POS) tags are thesame.
Here we assume that syntactic classificationfor the majority of FrameNet lexical entries (i.e.verbs and adjectives) are semantically motivated andare mostly preserved across different languages.
Forexample ?beat?
can be translated into {?, ?, ??,?
?, ?
?, ?
?, ?, ???}
in HowNet and {?,?
?, ?, ?
?, ??}
in the LDC English-Chinesedictionary.
?beat.v?
is then linked to all HowNetconcepts whose Chinese word/phrase is one of thetranslations and the part of speech is verb ?v?.In our example, HowNet concepts under twoHowNet categories??beat?
and ?damage?
are linkedto the ?cause_harm?
frame in FrameNet.
Only theconcepts in the top N categories are considered ascorrectly linked to the lexical entries in the?cause_harm?
frame.
We heuristically chose N to bethree in our algorithm.2.4.
Final mapping adjusted by taxonomydistance (step 3)Using frame context alone in the above step caneffectively prune out incorrect links, but it alsoprunes some correct links whose HowNet categoriesare not in the top three categories.
In this next step,we aim to recover this kind of pruned links by findingother categories with high similarity to the chosencategories.
We introduce the category similarityscore (Liu and Li, 2002), which is based on theHowNet taxonomy distance:2.3.
Refined mapping based on semanticcontexts in both languages (step 2)At this stage, each FrameNet lexical entry has linksto multiple HowNet concepts and categories.
Forexample, ?beat.v?
in ?cause_harm?
frame is linked to???
in both the ?beat?
category and the ?associate?category (as in???
?/make a phone call?).
We needto choose the correct HowNet concept (word sense).Many word sense disambiguation algorithms usecontextual words in a sentence as disambiguatingfeatures.Sim(category1,category2) =+d?
?Where d is the path length from category1 tocategory2 in the taxonomy.
?
is an adjustingparameter, which controls the curvature of thesimilarity score.
We set ?=1.6 in our work followingthe experiment results in Liu and Li (2002).
If thesimilarity of category p and one of the top threecategories is higher than a threshold t, the category pis also considered as a valid category for the frame.In our example, some valid categories, such as?firing|???
is not selected in the previous step eventhough it is related to the ?cause_harm?
frame.
Basedon the HowNet taxonomy, the similarity scorebetween ?firing|?
and ?beat|?
is 1.0, which isabove the threshold set.
Hence, ?firing|?
is alsochosen as a valid category and the concepts in thiscategory are linked to the ?beat.v?
lexical entry in the?cause_harm?
frame.
However, using taxonomydistance can cause errors such as ?
in the ?weave?category to be aligned to ?beat.v?
in the?cause_harm?
frame.2.5.
BiFrameNet lexicon evaluationWe evaluate our work by comparing the results toa manually set golden standard of transfer links forsome lexical entries in FrameNet, and use theprecision and recall rate as evaluation criteria.Manual evaluation of all lexical entries is a slowprocess and is currently still on-going.
However,to show the lower bound of the system performance,we chose FrameNet lexical entries with the highestnumber of transfer links to HowNet concepts as thetest set.
Since each link is a word sense, these lexicalentries have most ambiguous translations.
Sincethe number of lexical entries in a FrameNet parentframe (i.e.
frame size) is an important factor in thedisambiguation step, we analyze our results bydistinguishing between ?small frames?
(a frame withless than 5 lexical entries) and ?large frames?.24% of the frames are ?small frames?.
Referring toTables 2 and 3, we can see a weighted average of(0.649*0.24+0.874*0.76) =82% F-measure.lexicalentryParent frame #candidateHowNetlinks#lexicalentries inparentframebeat.v cause_harm 144 51move.v motion 132 10bright.a light_emission 126 44hold.v containing 145 2fall.v motion_directional 127 5issue.v emanating 124 4Table1.

Cross-lingual induction of exampleannotated sentences in BiFrameNetIn the second stage of our proposed work, we aimto automatically induce Chinese example sentencesthat are appropriate for each semantic frame.Together with English example sentences thatalready exist in the English FrameNet, they formpart of the BiFrameNet, and serve to provideconcrete examples of bilingual usage of semanticroles.
They can be used either as a resource formachine-aided translation or training data formachine translation.FrameNet is a collection of over 100-millionwords of samples of written and spoken languagefrom a wide range of sources, including British andAmerican English.
All the example sentences arechosen by linguists for their representative-ness ofparticular semantic roles, grammatical functions, andphrase type.
The current FrameNet contains onaverage 30 annotated example sentences perpredicate, which is still inadequate for automaticsemantic parsing systems (Fleischman et al, 2003).Each FrameNet example sentence contains apredicate.
The semantic roles of the related frameelements are manually labeled.
The syntactic phrasetype (e.g.
NP, PP) and their grammatical function(e.g.
external argument, object argument) are alsolabeled.
An example annotated sentence containingthe predicate ?beat.v?, in the ?cause_harm?
frame,is  shown below:Example sentence type: trans-simpleWe are fighting a barbarian, and [agent: we] must[predicate: beat] [victim: him].In order to provide a representative set of Chineseexample sentences automatically for a particularframe, our method must fulfill the following criteria:1) It must find real sentences occurring naturally inChinese texts;2) It should find sentences that cover as manydifferent usage and domain as possible;3) It must find sentences that have the samesemantic roles as the English example sentences;F F;;English sentence Chinese sentencefor frame for frameCandidate for frame:  Dynamic Programming alignment (Figure 5): :?

BiFrameNet example sentence induction4) It should require no manual annotation of anykind.There are at least three different (semi-)automaticapproaches for mining Chinese example sentences:i) Translate all English example sentences intoChinese by automatic means, and annotate thesemantic roles by word alignment;This approach is not appropriate because machinetranslation can be erroneous and this method doesnot satisfy criteria (1) and (2).ii) Construct an English semantic parser and aChinese parser independently, and use them toannotate the sentences in a sentence aligned,parallel corpus;Apart from the high cost of building two semanticparsers, which itself requires semantically annotatedChinese data; it would be necessary to createartificial links between independent humanannotations manually.iii) Mine Chinese sentences from a monolingualcorpus that are syntactically similar to the Englishexample sentence, and induce semantic roles fromthe syntactic transfer function between English andChinese.This is the approach we take.
Inspired by previouswork on syntax-driven semantic parsing (Gildea andJurafsky, 2002; Fleischman et al, 2003), andsyntax-based machine translation (Wu, 1997;Cuerzan and Yarowsky, 2002), we postulate thatsyntactically similar sentences with the samepredicate also share similar semantic roles.
In thispaper, we present our first experiments on inducingsemantic roles based on shallow syntacticinformation.
We mine Chinese example sentencesfrom naturally occurring monolingual corpus, andrank them by their syntactic similarity to our Englishexample sentences.
A dynamic programmingalgorithm then annotates the aligned syntactic unitswith the same semantic roles.
The example Chinesesentences are not translations of the Englishsentences.
Therefore, the set of example sentenceswithin a frame is enriched, providing better coveragefor MT and CLIR systems.3.1.
Induction from aligned predicate bilinguallexical pairSince frames are disjoint, we propose a methodfor finding example sentences one frame at a time.In this paper, we focus on finding Chinese examplesentences for the largest frame ?cause_harm?
andthe main semantic roles in this frame??agent?,?predicate?
and ?victim?1.For each English lexical entry and its targettranslation candidates in the BiFrameNet, we firstextract sentences that contain the translationcandidates from a large Chinese monolingualcorpus.
Figure 4 shows some initial Chineseexample sentence candidates under ?beat.v?.
Thereare many sentences that do not have the?agent-predicate-victim?
structure.
Our next step isto find the Chinese sentences that have the?agent?, ?predicate?
and ?victim?
semantic roles andannotate them automatically.?????????????????

Some Chinese example sentence andglosses3.2.
Inducing semantic roles from cross-lingualPOS transferAmong all the Chinese sentences containing thetarget predicate words, we need to identify those thatcontain the same semantic roles as those of theEnglish example sentences in FrameNet.
Currentautomatic semantic parsing algorithms (Gildea andJurafsky 2003, Fleischman et al, 2003) are all basedon syntactic parse trees showing a close coupling ofsemantic and syntactic structures.Without carrying out full syntactic parsing of theChinese sentences, we postulate that the semantic1 As an example, for ?beat.v?, 73% of the English examplesentences have these three semantic roles, only 27% also haveother semantic roles such as ?tools?.roles of a sentence are generated by the underlyingshallow syntactic structure of the sentence such asPOS tag sequences.
We therefore focus on findingbilingual sentence pairs that are comparable in POSstructure, though not necessarily having any lexicalcomparability.
Note that this constitutes only asubset of all possible Chinese example sentences foreach frame.
The expansion of this set remains theobjective of our future researchEnglish POS  Chinese POS  ( , )e c?PRP  N 3.16-e2NN  N 4.0-e6JJ  N 1.74-e4NNP Nr 4.257-e2JJS V 2.15-e4VB V 7.2-e5VBG Ad 1.34-e3VBG m  6.74-e3Table 5.

We use twostate-of-the-art POS taggers?a maximum entropybased English POS tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), andan HMM based Chinese POS tagger.2 We performtwo sets of experiments: (1) For each exampleEnglish sentence in the ?cause_harm?

ConclusionWe have presented a first quantitative andautomatic approach of constructing a bilinguallexical semantic resource?the BiFrameNet.BiFrameNet consists of mappings betweenFrameNet semantic frames and HowNet concepts, aswell as English and Chinese example sentences for aparticular frame, with annotated semantic roles inthe English FrameNet labels.
Evaluation resultsshow that we achieve a promising 82% averageF-measure on lexical entry alignment, for the mostambiguous lexical entries; and a 68-72% accuracy inChinese example sentence induction, for the largestframe.
The initial results are available athttp://www.cs.ust.hk/~hltc/BiFrameNet and will beupdated as further improvements and evaluations areimplemented.5.
DiscussionThere are a number of possible directions forfuture work.
One obvious extension is to usesyntactic parse tree representations instead of POSsequences in example sentence alignment.
Second,there are many other Chinese sentences that sharethe same semantic roles, but not the same POSsequences, which are not included.
Using additionalfeatures to correctly identify these sentences and theconstituent semantic roles is a topic of our ongoingresearch.
Moreover, we note that Chinese is a highlyidiomatic and metaphoric language.
Compounded bythe ambiguity of word boundaries, many predicateusages in Chinese are highly unexpected.
It is worthconsidering using other Chinese linguistic resourcesto enhance the example sentence extraction andannotation.
Finally, BiFrameNet needs to be furtherevaluated and manual post-processing is perhapsrequired.We expect the final complete BiFrameNet, inaddition to the various FrameNet and PropBankresources being developed manually, will be avaluable resource for statistical and interlinguatransfer-based MT systems, as well as to humantranslators in an machine-aided translation scenario.We are also motivated to investigate the relationshipbetween our results and those of semantic mappingmodels proposed by cognitive scientists.6.
