45D-7030"t - r~  " GSR at, SD\ [  ' \,"i 'i 11 In t roduct ionSyntactical robustness is a desired design pro-perry of natural language parsers.
Within thepast decade, several developmental robustnessapproaches have been %rwarded: Syntax-free se-mantic passing \[1\] co,~lstraint relaxation afterparse failure in a pattern matching \[2\] or ATNframework \[:3,4\], parse tree fittiug \[5\] and severalnon-formalized case frame approaches (e.g.
theparser series in \[6,7\]).
Three approaches \[5,8,9\]account for special defectivities by extendinggrarnmatical coverage.
This paper refo,:mulatesthe so-called weakness approach, first, publishedin \[I0\], which extends robustness to declarativeparsing formalisms.There are serious shortcomings in robustness re-search, emerging fl'om the common view of ro-bustness as a parsing and not as a representa-tion problem.
Typically, two distinct representa-tion levels for grammatical nd non-grammaticallanguage are assumed.
The former is given bythe basic fi'amework, the latter by relaxed pat-tern slots \[2\] or ATN arc re.sis \[3\], by "non-grammatical" meta-rules \[4\], by some construc-tion specific strategies \[6,7\] or by the schema me-chanism \[11\].
\Virile formalism syntax is somet;i-rues specified (e.g.
\[4,10\]), ~ semantics of robustgrmmnar formalisms, being m'.cessa.ry to definethese two representation levels, has not been gi-ven vet.
Without a well-defined formalism se-mantics, it is impossible to predict the behaviourof a (robust) grammar fragment when appliedto non-grammatical l nguage.
Therefore, no ro-bustness methodology has been available untilllOW,2 The  WACSG approach\VACSG (Weak ACSG) is an experimental for-realism for defining robust grammars, ACSG(Annotated Constituent Structure Grammar) isa class of two-level grammar formalisms uch as?The work reported has been supported by an LGFgrant from the Land Baden-VC/h'ttemberg.

Any less metaphorical constrtlc-tion of the notion of weakness needs a conside-rable formal apparatus.3 The  WACSG Formal i smA WACSG grammar ule is a context Dee pro-duction annotated with an attribute-value- (av-) formula.
The following two subsections dealwith weakness relations for context free gram-mars and av-languages.

Soundness and com-pleteness of 0 without E have been proven in\[16\].
The predicate "E" introduces well-founded,distributive, recurs?re sets of attribute-value-structures, and is discussed in \[17\] .

overspeei-fled) formulae.
Two different methods for main-taining consistency will be considered, namelyset weakening and default formulae.3.2.1 Set weaken ingIn robustness theory, the purpose of av-setsis to weaken the flmction condition on dr-structures.
Set weakening may be used e.g.
tbrthe transition from an inconsistent formula A =x(syn)(case) ~ nora A x(syn)(case)~ akk toa consistent (therefore non-equivalent) formulaA x(syn)(case)=xl  ~ nom Axa~ akk As1 Ex(syn)(case) A x2 C x(syn)(case).
This U'ansi-tion preserves case information, but not incon-sistency for the denotatmn J\[x~ .
In general, setweakening is defined as follows:(4)Let A E cO a fonmfla in disjunctive nor--mal form and t a non-constant tenn. Let.
L ?
A{Ai,j.k It occurs k - t imes  in a literalAi.j} a setof indices.
For any r E L~t , zr is a variablenot occuring in A.
The set weakening of A for aterm t isFor any A 6 cO and non-constant term t it hasbeen shown (see \[17\]) that, if RNF(A)  = A # ?,then also DNF(At)  = RNF(A ~) # 1.
There-fore, if A is satisfiable, then A t is also satisfia-ble.
Since satisfiability of A does not follow fromsatisfiability of A ~ (see above), A t is weaker-ofequivalent to A.
However, the theoretically mo-tivated Aqnotation has not been integrated intoWACSG formalism, since set weakening can beachieved by using the predicate "6".3.2.2 Dethu l tsr?he classical subsurnption ~_ gives a partial or-dering within tile set of av-models.
There are, ho-wever, no inconsistent models.
Therefore, a par-tiality notion with inconsistency must be basedupon descriptions i.e.
av-formulae.
The relation3-partial _C 0 ~ is a subsumption-isomorphisrninto a (canonical) subset of 0.
The relation 0-partial defined below is still weaker in allowinginconsistency ofone formula B and can be shownto be a superset of 3-partial, i.e.
3-partial C_ 0-partial.Let I 6 0 aconjunctionofl iterals, and A,B 6CO .
Then A 0-partial B iff:1.

leNF(A) ?Tile formula I C c) may be restricted to be aconjunction of default literals, whose predicateis marked with a. subscript a.
This gives a de-fault relation, which is a subset of a supersetof subsumption between formulae.
A relation ofdefault-satisfiability "l=a" may be based uponthis default relation.
It is easy to demonstratethat a default-relation like this has some desireddisambiguation properties: a disjunctive formulaA = A1 VA2 is reduced to RN.F(A1 A I) by con-joining it with a default formula I G 0 suchthat RNF(A2 A I) = I.4 WACSG formal i sm se -mant icsFor any WACSG-Grammar G, a domain D(G)and its subset SDDE(G) of strictly derivabledomain elements is defined as follows.
Any do-main element not in SDDE(G) bears weak-hess relations to a derivation co C Q(G) ,where w(0)(1) G Ssctind .Anyformulaw(i ) (2)(0 <~ i <_ leo) may be inconsistent.

For every WACSG grammar G, ho-wever, there is an equivalent WACSG grammarG' without any partial string indices within it.This grammar G' shows an extreme complexityalready for a few indices in G. This fact chal-lenges the view (see e.g.
\[8\]) that robustness canbe achieved by coverage xtension of any non-weakeable ACSG.5 A WACSG-t reatment  o fres tar tsin t;his section, the WACSG formalism is appliedto restarts, a class of spoken language construe-tions, which is often referred to in robustness li-terature \[2,3,4\].
A grammatical explanation, ho-wever, is still lacking.
The German restart datain 7 are given with transliteration and segmen-tation.
Constructions in 7,8 are ungrammatical,but not inacceptable.

Roughly, restarts are a kind of phra-sal coordination ot allowing for deletion phe-nomena such as ellipsis, gapping or left deletion.Additionally, the ~-substring (i) does not contri-bute to (extensional) meaning a of the construc-tion and, (ii), may show recursive defectivenes-ses such as contanfination and constituent break(examples 9,10).

Under the coordina-tion hypothesis, a parallelism between defectiveand non-defective restarts is assumed.
Right-recursive coordination of defective and nondefec-tive conjuncts is unrestricted.
In 11, equations i-mulating semantic and syntactic projections (see\[18\]) "control up" the syntactic but not, the se-mantic description of a f l  conjunct in a restartconstruction.In rules 13,14, partial string indices ,sef3r~ undPAH allow a defect conjunct to cover a prefixsubstring (if no phonological restart marker ofcategory AC is present) or every substring (ifthere is a restart marker).aHowever ,  it  does  cont r ibute  t,o mean ing  in an  in ten-s iona l  sense:  ~3-substr ings are  not, absurd .158 3i~,ulc 1.1 applies set weakening to the syntacticav structures of both conjuncts, resulting in awell-l:nown coordina.tion treatment \[19\].
Defaulteqtmtions provide disaml)iguation to syntacticfeatures \[~x:(syn)(case)~ and ~x:(syn)(gender)\]\], since defectiviV may render the first conjunctambiguous 4.
Furthermore, rule 15 shows defaultweakening of the syntactic description of NP's.

Therefore, rules 16,18introduce an additional term x(kosem),such that \[\[;c(kosem)\]\] is the semantic struc-ture of a set Ix\] of openly coordina-ted av.-structures.
By default satisfiabilityof x(sem) ~d x(kosem), \[\[x(sem)~ equals~\[x(kosem)~ except if \[\[x~ is the av set of anon-restart coordination.Since defectivity, e.g.
a constituent, break.may render incomplete the fl verbal phraseincomplete, rule 17 provides semantic de-fault values for every possible semantic ar-gument.l)istribut.ed av formulae may be necessaryfor one conjunct but inconsistent with (thedescription of) the other.
This situationma.y arise due to contamination of thefirst: (fl-) conjunct.
Independently it can beshown that contaminations almost exclusi-vely affect syntactic (as opposed to seman-tic) t~atures.
Now, if the conditions cohe-rence and completeness ( ee \[11\]) are deti-ned on semantic structure, syntactic cohe-rence can be inforced by lexicalized formu-lae as shown in 19 that depend on a syntac-tic defectivity feature ~x(syn)(defec)\](14) A' IOCpAI .
