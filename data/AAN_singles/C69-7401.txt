~s -?Computer i zed  L ingu is t i cs  ,A~commentarybyMar t in  Minow, KVAL Group.
S tockho lmIn read ing  through the var ious  prepr in ts ,  I was s t ruck  by the fact thatmany  were  concerned  with spec i f i c  computer  imp lementat ions  of one k indor another .
Unfor tunate ly ,  there  seems to be l i t t le  d i scuss ion  of the program-ing f rom the programmer 's  v iewpoint .
Th is  is  under  s tandab le  in a congressof computat iona l  l i ngu is t i cs  but,  I fee l ,  somewhat  regret tab le .
Espec ia l l ynce the repor ts  of what  has  a l ready  been done sure ly  wil l  s t imu la te  otherr t i c ipants  to use  computers .
I th ink  that an in fo rmal  sess ion  on program-ming  in computat iona l  l i ngu is t i cs  would be both in teres t ing  and va luab le ,a l lowing an exchange of ideas  and exper iences  which would be much moredi f f icu l t  in the even  more  in fo rmal  a tmosphere  of the dining room.In o rder  to in i t iate  such  a sess ion ,  I am enc los ing  the fol lowing quest ions ,hoping that they will s t imu la te  a cer ta in  in fo rmal  cor respondence  be fore  thecongress  beg ins .
If enough in teres t  is  shown in th is  idea to war rant  a sess ion ,I in tend to edit the rep l ies  rece ived  (to the extent  they  show s imi la r i t ies ) ,mak ing  summar ies  ava i lab le  to par t i c ipants  be fore  the conference .In answer ing  the quest ions ,  it is  of course  not necessary  to conf ine your -se l f  to the par t i cu la r  p ro jec t  you are  d i scuss ing  at the conference  if  anotherp ro jec t  wil l  y ie ld a more  in teres t ing  rep ly .
Th is  is  not, in o ther  words ,  af inal  examinat ion .~ at type of p ro jec t?IRModel ing of l i ngu is t i c  sys temData-  pr  oc e s s ingSometh ing  e l se  or  more  than  one areaOne- t ime run  or cont inuous  product ion~mt  language (mach ine ,  etc) was  used?

Were  o ther  languages  ava i lab le?

What percent  commentary?If you used time sharing, did it help?How did the software "bureaucracy" (for example, Job Control Language on th~IBIVt 360) af fect  the programming  for better  or worse?Can the program be eas i l y  imp lemented  on a d i f ferent  mach ine  or sys tem?
(Was th is  one of the ob jec t ives? )
If th i s  was t r ied ,  how painful  was the exper ienceof t rans fer r ing  the program?If you were to s ta r t  all over again,  would you use the same language?Have you been teach ing programming  to l ingu is t i cs  s tudents?
If so, what has  beenthe i r  exper ience?
Yours?
Should l ingu is ts  learn  programming?
Why?KVAL- is  beginning to plan a fa i r ly  la rge  computer  sys tem for t rans la t ionf rom Swedish to "condensed"  Bra i l l e .
Th is  requ i res  a la rge  d ict ionary,  fa i r lysoph is t i ca ted  character  manipu lat ion  rout ines ,  and the abi l i ty to per fo rm pure lyl ingu is t i c  operat ions  on the input text (to recogn ize  sy l lab les ,  morphemes ,  etc).Addit ional ly ,  the input-output  p rob lems are  not at al l  t r iv ia l .
We a lso  want top roduce  a sys temwhich  can be moved eas i ly  - both to d i f ferent  computers  with inSweden, and  even,  i f  poss ib le ,  to other  languages ,  The program should a lso  b Ose l f -document ing  and permi t  easy  modi f icat ion in a modu lar  fash ion as new words,new syntact ic  t rans format ions ,  etc p rove  usefu l .
It would a lso  be nice if the" l ingu is t i c  work" could be wr i t ten by l ingu is ts  with only a l i t t le p rogrammingt ra in ing ,  ra ther  than the other  way around.
We wou ldn ' t  even mind  if it wascheap and fast .
gSuggest ions  p lease:  What language,  mach ine ,  type,  etc?
How should the d ic t ionarybe s tored  (assume any random-accesss  device you are  fami l ia r  wit'h)?
D iscuss ' thegoa ls ,  rank ing them in t~,~ l ight of your  own exper ience .- 3 -There  i s  much to c r i t i c i ze  in the cho ice  and fo rm of the above quest ions .The na ivety  i s  obv ious  - to a cer ta in  extent  it i s  due to my own inexper ience  inth i s  f ie ld  (KVAL" s p rob lem has  sure ly  been  faced  - i f  not so lved  - by every  IRpro jec t ,  for  example) .
To a greater  extent ,  however ,  the na ivety  i s  p resent  top revent  the quest ions  f rom conta in ing  the i r  own answers .
By a l l  means ,  c r i t i c i zethe  quest ions .
If you do not fee l  they  are  per t inent  to your  own exper ience ,  or  tothe prob lem i t se l f ,  ask  your  own, and answer  them.P lease  in fo rm me i f  you would be in teres ted  in tak ing  par t  in a pane l  d i s -cuss ion  dur ing  the  conference .
