A LARGE RUSSIAN MORPHOLOGICAL  VOCABULARYFOR IBM COMPATIBLE~,AND METHODS OF  ITS  COMPRESSIONIgor  A. BOLSHAKOVVINZT I ,  Academy'  o f  Sc iences  of  USSRMoscow 125219,  Bal - t ; iyskayE~ u\].. 14, USSRThere are only few Russian vocabularies incomputerized form in the USSR new, so development of anew Russian vocabulary large enough for spell checkingis sti l l  topical.The requirements for such a vocabulary are atleast as follows : l} sore than iO0,O00 lexemesincluded; 2) modern and diversified lexicon wellcovering the sciences, many technological fields, thehumanities, and may be the everyday life; 3) mappingthe most of numerous lexeme forms implied by the~lectional nature of Russian, and at the same timeacceptance of well-formed words only; 4) orientationto IBM-compatible PCs most commonly used in the USSR~owaday.Such a w)oabulary has been recently built by thea~thor.
Its parameters are as follows: 67,400 stemscovering more than 104,700 Russian lexemes and their~.425 million word-forms (i,e.
21.2 forms/stem); the~isimal, the mean, and the maximal stem lengthsamounting to 1, 7.8, and 32 letters accordingly; thetextual form size being about 865 KB,Our morphologic~l ciassific~tlo~ of stems is quiteoriginal and deals not only with ~ord formation, butalso with word derivation.
The scheme includes i18classes and 1901 various fieetions (variable suffixalchains).
Separate classes were introduced amongmentioned ones for invariant words, irregular forms,and abbreviations, The first 38 classes cover morethan 83X of all stems.The split borders of stems were freely moved tothe left whi le classifying, if morphologicalalternations or identical final letters in a wholestem class have been encountered.
The shortestflection is an empty one, the longest flectionsinclude up to 12 letters (e.g.
HPOMB~WHC~), so them~an fleetion length grew up to 6 letters, which iscomparable to the mean stem length.The textual form of vocabularies i  not convenientfor applications and has to be transformed into binaryworking form.
The wellknown arehivization packagessuch as PKA~q/PKXARC are not acceptable for thisperpose because of low squeeze ratio and uselessnessof the arehivized form as a working one for spellersor any other application, So several other methods ofcompression were analyzed,Basically the Huffman method has been selected forcoding morphological class numbers, and the Coopermethod has been picked up for the stems, Additionallythe RADIX-50 method was applied to both of thecomponents of a vocabulary entry.Several other techniques are turned out to beuseful for additional stem compression in largevocabularies.
They are based on l} frequentrecurrences of differently classified, but literallyidentical stess; 2) coamoness of events in nearlysaturated vocabularies, when the first letter in thedeflecting part of a stem is alphabetically adjacentto the letter in the same position within previousstem; 3) availability of several free positions inRADIX-50 code table (only 33 of gO are grasped byEussian letters and a delimiter).
These unoccupiedvalues night be used for re-coding final stem letters,digrams, and trigrams most frequent in different stemclasse~, This technique squeezes the letter part of avocabulary entry and make the delimiter preceding thenext entry unnecessary.All methods mentioned were investigated,separately and in combinations.
The Huffman's + theCooper's + RADIX-50 combination has given us a sqeezeratio about 3.4, whereas addition of the resttechniques has incremented the ratio up to 4.2 - 4.5.So only about l~O KB in memory is needed for thisworking form, which is easy allocatable as a residentpart of a modern text processor, As compared tevocabularies in available English language spellers,the size achieved seems to be highly competitive inour more complex inflectional case.The vocabulary is available beth in the textualand in binary forms, Several utilities concerned withits compiling, debugging, and squeezing are ready too.The uti l it ies were written using Turbo Pascal 5.0 andTurbo Professional packages and are wholly applicablefor processing any other natural language vocabulary,1 317
