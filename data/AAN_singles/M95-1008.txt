Knight-Ridder Information's Value Adding Name Finder :A Variation on the Theme of FASTU SArkady Borkovsky '(arkady @ dnt .dialog .com)Knight-Ridder Information, Inc., participated in MUC-6 with VANF (Valu eAdding Name Finder), the system used by Knight-Ridder Information i nproduction for adding a Company Names descriptor field to online newspape rand newswire databases .
Knight-Ridder Information participated in the NE tas konly .
The system used for MUC-6 is exactly the same as is used in production.The only difference is the input and output formats .
VANF used a cascadednon-deterministic state machines approach and is based on FASTUS .1 .BackgroundLate 1992, we realized that a company like Knight-Ridder Information (Dialog Information Services, a tthat time) had to get into the business of Value Added Reselling of information.
An obvious question was:what kind of value can be added to the information?
The obvious answer was that the added value shoul dhave the same nature as the original : it should be information.
The plan was to introduce NLP intoDialog's technology to add informational value to raw documents .
The industrial environment requiredthat anything we work on has a fmite development time and is usable in production after the developmen tis over.
This dictated step-wise development and required starting with solvable problems .
The obviouschoice was smart tokenization, which included named entity detection.Originally, we tried to buy the technology from outside, so that a full-fledged partnership could bedeveloped based on the initial project.
Two first attempts ended in nothing (although they were quiteuseful experiences for Dialog, and probably for the potential partners as well).
The third one, with SRI ,led to development of the current system, VANF (Value Adding Name Finder), which is routinely used i nproduction at Knight-Ridder Information .
VANF is an independent re-implementation of FASTUS [I] .At first, we wanted to use FASTUS as it was.
However, the production requirements prohibited using aLisp environment, and we decided to port it (to c++) .
A direct port was not feasible ; at the same time, SRIdecided that a declarative, grammar-like description of FSM was more intuitive and easier to work wit hthan the graphical tools they were using at the time .
So a grammar definition language was defined, w espent some time discussing and refining it, and I implemented an engine for Dialog's version of thelanguage.
Under the contract we had, SRI delivered a transcription of FASTUS rules in the new(declarative) language, although they did not have their own interpreter (nor even a complete languag edefinition) at that time .
Somehow, we made this transcription compile and work in Dialog 's system, an dused it as the core of VANF.
Currently, about 30% of VANF rules are derived from FASTUS .
Still,VANF should be considered a variation on the theme of FASTUS .Two thousand documents from different newspapers were processed by human content specialists and th enames to be extracted as companies were tagged .
The definition of a "company" was "user oriented " (e .g .football teams were to be considered companies, while publications, trade unions and governmen torganizations were not) .
One thousand of the documents were then used as a training set, and the othe r1000 as a blind test set .1 Currently with Verity, Inc. reachable as arkady@verity .
corn87The overall effort on VANF was about 8 months of one developer's time (developing the engine, thelexicons, and the rules), 6 person-months of the content specialists' effort, and about 6 person-months o fproject management effort.2 .System Descriptio n2.1 .
Software architectureVANF consists of?
the Facts Extraction Engine (rules parser and cascaded non-deterministic state machines interpreter )?
the rules set?
evidence combiner?basic document scanner and lexicon interfac e?
system interfaceThe Facts Extraction Engine uses cascaded non-deterministic state machines (cascaded NDFSM) toparse the text and to look for patterns .A grammar defines a set of NDFSM and the sequence of their application.The terminal symbols in the grammar are literal words and combinations of syntactic and dictionary flags .Given a NDFSM SKand a sequence of symbols.SS?
all the paths are followed;?
the longest matching sequence 3t1 ..i] is considered the result of the application;?the actions corresponding to all the longest paths are executed ;?a single output symbol (i .e .
a head word with a bunch of attributes) is sent to the next stage .Then 9Kis applied to the next segment ofThe output of his used as the input for another NDFSM .
Each stage is responsible for specific kind ofprocessing (see below) .This approach allows us to restrict non-determinism and prevent combinatorial explosion.
The expressivepower of our formalism is the same as that of the attribute grammars ; at the same time the efficiency i sclose to that of finite state machines .The approach is very similar to that used in FASTUS[1] .Evidence combiner and knowledge base .
We are not interested in the NDFSM output per se .
The patternmatching results are collected from the side-effect of the actions attached to the rules.Most important are the actions which assert facts extracted from the text (in the VANF case, the facts arein the form "NNN is a name of an entity of type X") .
These assertions are not treated as the ultimate truth ,but all the evidence is collected and combined by an evidence combiner .This include s?
matching the variants of names?resolving conflicts between contradicting evidenc e88checking the names against the known names databaseThe document scanner parses the input documents in their native format (fields, SGML tags, etc .)
.breaks a document into paragraphs, and does the lexicon look-up .
It also takes care of entities like simpl edates, phone numbers, and other regular quasi-lexical units .
This part of the scanner is based on regularexpressions (lex) .2.2.
Text processing flow1) The basic tokenizer (written in lex) handles lexicon lookup, capitalization, simple money, number ,phone-number, and date expression processing, simple unknown names processing: multi-wordlexicon entries are handled here as well .2) The preprocessor (1st stage of NDFSM) looks for sentence boundaries, more complicated number an ddate expressions, obvious names type determination and other names bracketing .3) The chunker (2nd stage of NDFSM) brackets noun phrases and verb groups, replacing them with thei rhead words .4) The pattern matchers; several stages of NDFSM detect certain interesting types of noun groups usingpatterns( "ABC 's president X", and look for other patterns relevant to the VANF task; for eachinteresting pattern an attached function is executed to pass on a , candidate name to the evidenc ecombiner.5) The evidence combiner (C++) merges similar names and assigns types to the names whose type couldnot be derived from the form or from the context ; database lookup happens here as well .Thus, the name type defmition is performed based on several kinds of evidence :?
name's form (during step 2)?
name's context (during step 4)?
similarity with already defined name (step 5 )?
database lookup (step 5 )3 .The History and the Future3.1.
"Where the bulk of effort was spent"Knight-Ridder Information, Inc .
did only the NE part .The original VANF development tool :4 months - the engine4 months - the rules and improving the lexiconThen, for the MUC-6 evaluation :1 month - preparation for MUC ; this included improving the rules based on the training corpu sand making the system interface component to produce output, which made the MU Cscorer happy .3.2 .Technical characteristicsProcessing rate : 5 Mb / hourReloading the lexicon : 20 secReloading the grammar: 20 sec893.3.
Training and rules modificatio nAll rules development was done by hand .
The engine provides a lot of tracing information and allows easydefinition of which rule(s) contributed to a specific decision .
This should help to implement automati ctraining (see below) in the future .
At present, this allows us to modify rules .
Also, the reason we could ge tanywhere at all was the fast turn-around cycle : modifying the grammar, and rerunning a document take sabout 1 minute .3.4.
Experience gained from VANF and the futur eOur experience with VANF has proved that a core cascaded NDFSM approach is suitable for man yintelligent text processing tasks .
As it was pointed out in [1], an efficient implementation and easy-to-us etools allowed us to tune a pretty primitive technology to produce quite useful results .
In our case, suc hefficiency made it possible to build a rule set consisting of many quite specific rules, such that althoug heach one has a limited application, together, they cover a large area .
In the future, such rule sets should b econstructed using automated tools .
Two future tasks will be concentrated on :?
training / rules building tools ; the author plans to develop a learn-by-example system, conceptuall ysimilar the Autoslog [2] and the like ;?
non-boolean evidence combining .904.
Appendix 1 : Lexicon and Grammar Sample sThe lexicon contains word forms with flags ; the flags encode POS and semantic information .
There is noformal differentiation between primary (N, V) and secondary (Sing, Trans) morphological features, no rbetween grammatical and semantic flags .
The flags corresponding to different meanings of a word aremixed in the same entry .
(Therefore, in the grammar, N[Country] or Country[N] are equivalent notations .One can also write N[V] meaning "any word which is both a verb and a noun" .

The Walk-Through Exampl e5.1 .Errors list.1) Punctuation -2) "Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson" and "WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson" were treated assingle entities ; this is strange, because we have rules to split them, and the evidence combiner mus thave picked the second parts of these names, because they occur elsewhere .
A possible explanation i sthat Dialog' s original requirements explicitly advised against splitting the names, which might mak esense in the first of the two examples.3) "60 pounds" taken for a monetary expression .4) All occurrences of " Coke" were ignored.5) "New York Times" ignored - according to Dialog's spec .6) The Title field was not processed at all - for no good reason .7) "Other ad agencies, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fallon McElligott<IENAMEX>," - a bug5.2 .
