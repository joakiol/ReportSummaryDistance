They may be enhanced by modern displayresources They are apphcable to individual source texts or to data sets aswholes Most importantly, we can tackle tins level of summarising because cur-rent robust parsing technology may succeed, given source redundancy, mgettingenough of value from sources to help users, and because current ext produc-tion methods can deliver usable summary texts We should push this line hard,seehng to rmmrarse appheatlon-spec~c domain knowledge, to take advantageof discourse structure, and to address ummary function for the user
