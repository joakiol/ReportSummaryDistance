Aspect and Aktionsart: Fighting or Cooperating?Al lan  RamsayCent re  for (?omputa l ; io lml  L ingu is t i csUMIST ,  PO Box 88, Mancheste l '  M60 1QD,  Eng landAbst rac tIt is widely accepted that semanti(: ttle-ories should, as far as possible, be com-positional.
The claim that a dmory is(:omt)ositional, however, lacks bite if lex-ical and pre-lexical items are allowed tomean dilrerent things ill difl'erent con-texts.
The aim of the current paper isto show how to deal with a well-knownt)henolnenon by relying on (:ombinato-rim effects to infer difforent consequencesfrom the same items in difl'erent contextswithout altering the contributions thatthese items make individually.1 Compos i t iona l i ty  vs. Coerc ionConsi(ler the thllowing sentences:1 Henrietta was crossing the wad.2 Harry was hiccupping.in (1) it seems as though the present participlemarker is being used to indicate, that some eventwith a well-defined end point was in progress atsome time in the past, and that it is reasonableto suppose that this end point was eventuallyreached Ihmrietta did cross the road.
Caseslike (1) are generally taken to be prototypical: thepresent parti(:it)le marker indicates the progressiveaspect, which says that sonto extended event witha recognisable nd t)oint is in progress and willprobably reach its conclusion.
(Asher, 1992) considers the circumstances un-der which (1) will lend you to conclude that Hen-rietta did indeed reach the far side of the road,arguing that this conclusion can only be reachedby using a default inference rule which would becancelled in cases like:3 Ilcnrictta was crossing th, c wad, when sh, e washit by a bus.I have.
no argument with his analysis of (1) and(3).
What concerns me here is the apparentchange in the contribution of the present partici-ple marker in (2).
In (2) we have a (conceptually)instantaneous (',vent, namely a hiccup.
Since hic-cups are generally thought of as taking no time,it; is not possible~ to be in the middle of a singlehiccup and hence we are solnehow driven to con-elude that Harry was in the middle of a series ofhiccut)s. A similar problem arises with:4 Allan is living in Bray.Here we have a homogeneous state where there isno result to be achieved no interesting state ofaffairs that arises as a consequence of reaching theend point.
As such the present participle cannotbe taken as an indication that the cuhninationof my living in Bray has not been reached, sincethere is no such cuhnination to reach.
In this easethe present l)artieiple somehow transforms itselfto an indicator of temporariness, o that you {:angel; exchanges like the following:Allan's living in BrayI thought he lived in Buxton....
Yes, but he's on a visit to Ireland atthe inoInent(Smith, 19911) deals with this phenomenon by ap-pealing to a notion of "derived interpretations",though with very little discussion of how thederivations take place.
(MoSns and Steedman,1988) deal with it by invoking a process of co-ercion which changes the meaning of the ast)ectmarkers as required by the properties of the verbto which they are attaehe(t. Much of what I wantto say below follows their anMysis, with one m~>jor difference..
Coercion changes tile meaning ofthe aspectual marker in response to the semmlticproperties of the marked verb.
But if items are al-lowed to change their meanings as a consequenceof the semantic properties of other items then theprinciple of compositionality hat"the mealfing of the whole is made out of simple l(:onlbinations of the meanings of the parts"t If we alh)w arbitrary rules of combination thenwe (:an include rules which make arbitrary changes889becomes rather ineffectual.
We are, alter all, ledto describe a word as being a homonym in exactlythose cases where the meaning of what appears tobe a single lexical item depends on the semanticproperties of the words it is being combined with.In5 IIe keeps his money tied up in the bank.6 He keeps his boat tied up by the bank.the fact; that; the interpretation of bank dependson the semantic properties of money and boat iswhat; persuades us that the form bank is being usedto realise two diffe.rent lexical items.
We do not,however, want to describe the present participlemarker as being ambiguous, with different inter-pretations which depend on the semantic contextin which it occurs, unless we are absolutely forcedto.
The analysis in this paper attempts to showthat the effects described by Mogns and Steedman(:an be achieved without any meaning-changing op-erations or unwanted ambiguities.The basic tool that I will use is the observationthat A U F ~ A can hold when neither A ~ A nor\]7' ~ A does, and ill particular that if P and F' aredifferent then A U F ~ A and A U P' ~ A' canhold where A and A' are different, or even incom-patible.
If we back ut) the labels representing lex-ical and predexical items with appropriate sets ofmeaning postulates then we may well find that dif-ferent things can be inferred from a single itein indifferent semantic contexts without being forcedto conclude that those items themselves mean dif-ferent things.
In this way the meanings of wordswill cooperate to convey more complex inessagesthan each can carry alone.2 Meaning Postu latesConsider tile following analysis of7 Harry was hiccupping,.A::{ (subset(A, .\[ B, name(B, Harry)\])A IAI = i)}~C :: {past( C) } prog( C,?

If this happens thenthe principle has no force.
"Simple" combinations areusually taken to be things like function applicationand set union or intersection.~The analyses in this paper require a combinationof truth functional operators and l-abstraction.
Iuse the notation .\[x, P\] rather than txP  to empha-sise that I am relying (Turner, 1987)'s treatment ofabstraction, where you can safely combine the two,rather than classical -calculus where you run the riskof paradoxes if you combine them.a~X::{P}(Q) says that Q is true of the X whichsatisfies P. As such it performs much the same roleevent of type "hiccup", or that someone is thepatient of an event, and so on, are spelt, out illdetail then it is not possible to perform any non-trivial inDrences on tile basis of this interpretation(and hence not; possible to argue about whether ornot it is right, so that the clainl that a fragmentof natural language should be paraphrased ill aparl;icular way becomes vacuous).
You might, forinstance, disagree with my decision to label thesleeper as the patient of the event.
Unless I spellout what this label commits me to, there is noway for me to defend it; or for you to attack it,.Simply appealing to our everyday intert)retationof tile term will not do.We therefore need to develop a collection ofmeanin.q postulates (MPs) to specify tile conne(>dons between the terlns that will appear ill ourinterpre.tations.
This is perhaps an obvious point,but apart from a few honourable xceptions (theattempt in (Dowty, 1988) to specify the conse~quences of assigning all item to a thematic roleis a notable case) it is too often neglected.
The.central claim of the current paper is that; tile inter-actions between Ineaning postulates can producesut)tle effects which you may miss if you simplylabel items as belonging to (:lasses or as being inrelationships with one another and leave it at thatif you simply say, for instance, that some eventis progressive, without spelling out the MPs forprogressive.3 Akt ionsar t  and  Aspect  Rev is i tedI will now look in some detail at aspect and aktion-sart.
For the remainder of this section I will saythat; the relationship specified by an aspect markerholds between a tilne and all event type, where anevent type is nothing more.
t, hall all abstractionover a proposition about ewmts.
What  we needare tile meaning postulates that  spell out the con-sequences of saying that a time and an event; typeare in the relationship specified by some aspectmarker.
I make the following assumptions:?
The aspect; of the core verb specifies a re-lationship between all instant and all eventtype.
The details of these relationships arespelt; out via MPs.?
The tense of the core verb, together withally auxiliaries, specify a relationship betweenthe present ime now, all anaphoric referencetime re\]', and the time mentioneA in this rela-tionship.
Nothing much in tile analysis belowdepends on the particular properties of the.time lille.
The only assumption that i willmake any use of is t;hat there are intervalsand instants.?
The MPs for the core verb specify the tempo-ral properties of the event type.
If the verbas (Barwise and Perry, 1983)'s notion of anchoring.890shares temporal 1)roI)erties with a range ofother verbs, then dwse are gathered togetheras MPs for the (:lass as a whol(;, which is r('-ferred to as an aktionsart.The first MP we, will consid('r deals with the pro-gressive asi)e(:t , as folh)ws:MP I ) rog:Vtgl'(prog( t, 1")A -\]el (lnc"m.bc','(cl, E)A \]t,l(t,l ( tA ,~t,.,./4..(.,, ~,)))A ~e.2 (m,e.m.r(e2, E)A - ~-fll,,e (l:~ < tA e~,,dpl,(e.~, t2)))))This says that the relationshi I) prog hol(ls t)(!tweenan instant /; and an event l;yi)(; P if there is a sel,}\]\] of events of t;h(; al)t)roprial;e tyl)c , at; least oneof whi(:h starts })efore the insbmt and at least, oneof which does not end 1)efor(~ it;.Meaning 1)osl;ulates are 1101; ileCe.ssary alia Slltli-('.lent; (:on(tit;ions.

There are many other MPs dealing withthese verbs, since there is a great deal more to besaid about them, but we do not need this extradetail here and hence we will omit it.Compare now the following analysis of8 Ite is eating a peach.3A ::{A C .\[B,peach(B)\] A IAI =1},,C::{O c_ .\[D, male(D)\] A ICl =1},prvg(now,?
\[E, object(E, A) A agent(E, C)A event(E) A type(E, eat)\])with the interpretation of (7) given earlier.
MPprog  says in each case that there must be anevent whose start point is before now and an eventwhich does not have an end point, before now.
Inthe case of (8) this is compatible with the possibil-ity of there being exactly one such event.
Indeed,since only one peach is involved, the remainder ofthe MP for eat '(which would include the informa-tion that you can only eat something once) wouldpresumably force this conclusion.
It is further-more compatible with the requirement that thereshould be an event whose start is before t and anevent, whose, end is not before t, since eating eventsare extended - if they have end points then theseare after their start points.
In the case of (7) itis not, possible for there to be a single event, sincethe start and end points of a single hiccup aretaken to occur with no intervening instant.
Wetherefore find that (7) must denote a set of hic-cups, simply by inspecting the MPs and withoutresorting to a process which turns hiccupping froman instantaneous act to a homogeneous sequenceof acts.
In both cases, the sentence reports a se-quence of events.
But in (8) there is nothing tosay that this sequence has more than one mem-ber, and the fact that only on(; peach is involvedsuggests that it has exactly one member; whereasin (7) the temporal properties of the conceptuallyinstantaneous act of hiccupping mean that theremust be more than one such event.Returning to4 Allan is living in Bray.we get the following interpretation:~A::{A C_ -\[B, name(B, Allan)\] A IA t -1},prog(now,?
\[C, agent(C, A)A event(C) A tyve(c, live)A ~D::{D C .
\[E, name(E, Bray)\]A iDI--1},in(O,D))\])Why does this carry an overtone of "temporari-ness"?
Assuming that live denotes a state, weneed to look at the interactions between the MPfor the progressive aspect and the MP for the ak-tionsart state.
MP s ta te  says that the charac-teristic property of the state is true of its patientthroughout some interval, but unlike MP relic-event  it says nothing about the start and endpoints of that state, not even whether or not theyexist.
Of course in general we know that moststates do have start and end points, but in manycases that is all we know about them.
A speakerwho is committed to the existence of a state, then,may not be concerned about the existence of thestart or end point of that state they may notknow when it started, they may not care whetherit has ended, as far as they are concerned it mayhave been going on since the beginning of time andit; may continue to the emt of time.
If, however,their report of tiffs state invokes the progressiveaspect then they do become committed to know-ing something about the start and end dates.
If,for instance, we were considering Allan was livingin Bray rather than Allan is living in Bray thenwe would assume that the speaker knew enoughabout the end of this state to place it before thereference point marked by the past tense of theauxiliary.
Thus the use of the progressive aspecthere commits the speaker to the existence of anend date for the state in a way in which commit-ment to the existence of tile state does not: itis this that gives (4) its feeling of being about atemporary state of atfairs 4.We now turn to the simple aspect.
Consider thefollowing pair of sentences:9 Allan lives in Bray.10 Mary eats a peach for her" lunch.
(9) describes a simple homogeneous state of af-fairs.
The properties of the verb live and t, he sin>ple aspect seem to collude in this case, and there isno need for anything like coercion.
In (1.0), on theother hand, the.re does seem to be a problem.
Eat-ing denotes an activity with a definite final state,where what was eaten ends up inside the eater'sstomach.
Somehow (10) conveys the message thatMary habitually eats a peach for her lunch: notein particular that it is not the same peach or thesame lunch every day!We therefore need a single MP for the simple as-pect which enables us to conclude different hingstbr the two cases.
For (9), where the verb denotesa homogeneous state of affairs, the simple aspectsupports tile conclusion that such a state of af-fairs does indeed hold.
For (10), where the verbdenotes an activity, the simple aspect supports the4of.
(Smith, 1991)'s observation that aspect pro-vides a spotlight on some portion of the event.892conclusion that such an activity hal)pens on a reg-ular basis.
The following meaning postulate saysthat the relationshit) simple holds between an in-stant t and all event type P if there is an interval Iwhich contains t, and for any instant t' in I there issome event e of the apt)ropriate tyI)e which startsbefore t' and finishes after it.MP s imple :VWP(.simple(t, P)-?

Then there is noth ing in MP s in lp le  tolead us to infe, r the existence of more than onesuch state, of affairs.
There is also n(/dting to en-able us to infer that there is no more ttmn one: Iwill return to this below.If, on the other hand, tile Mt ) for eat says thatthe start and end points of the action must bequite close together, then MP s imple  entails thatthere must be several such actions in the specifiedinterval.
Whi(:h is, after all, as much as you caninfer fi'om the simple aspect itself.
Note that thewide scope of the aspect oi)erator si'mple ineansthat for (f0) we are conside, ring ewmt types inwhich there is a pea(:h, and a hmch, for every in-stance of the type.
So unlike (8), where there wasone peach and the event type we were consider-ing dealt with eating that one peach, here there isnothing driving us to (:onclude that there is onlyone peach and hence that the set of events nmstbe a single, ton.The combination of have and a t)ast-participle(I will call this the pmuq.~(;q'wt,; different peopleuse different erminology \['or this) prese.nts imilarproblents.
We can obtain the same kind of inter-pretation for such sent;en(:es, paraphrasing11 He had slept.as~A ::{past(A)}reI =JA m::{u c_ .\[c,.,../e(c)\] A I~1 =1}ped(,'ei, .\[m, *ge,"(D, ~)A event(D)A type(I), sleep)\]))"All" we need now is a suitable MP for the relationper5Part  of the diffcre, nce bet;ween this constructionand the simple past arises from the explicit men-tion here of the R.l<lq,;R.l:;N(llr; TIME (l{eiehenltach,1956).
Sentence, s like (1l) make reh~renee to s()nleanaphorically determined instant, and this givesthem a slightly difli;rent flawmr t?om sinqfle pastsentences.
But there is more to it than tha~.Consider the following examples:12 He lived in Bray for five years.l a  lie has lived in Bray for five years.14 He had lived in Bray for five years.The striking thing about these is that itt each of(13) and (:1.4) the obvious interl,retadon is tsha/;his period of living in Bray continued after thereference time, so that he probatfly live.d there formore than five years in total; whereas it is atl butimpossilfle to read (112) as saying anything otherthan that his residence in Bray took no more orless than five years.
This distinction becomes evenclearer when we consider15 In 1919 It(; had lived in Bray for five', years.16 In 1919 he lived in B~zty.17 * In 1919 h,e lived in BTny for five years.It; seems that whereas you can have both a dateand a duradon with the perfective, you Call haveeither but not both with the simple past.
Oneway to account for this is to argue that the simplepast deals with the end point of the event whereasthe perfective deals with the end of some relatedinterval.
We have to be carefifl here.
The MI'  forthe simph', asliect given above is designed'to beopen to readings where some single past event isbeing report;ed and to the possibility of a "hat)ifual" reading.
The perfective is also open to thesame ol)tions:18 I had read the Times for years, but had grad-ually come to reeognise it as a capitalist rag.We have further to acknowledge the correct intu-ition that for telic events the perfcctive fbcuses onthe end point of the event where the sinq)le aspect;views it as a whole.
My current approach takesthe MP given above for simple as a basis for t)oth,893but adds an extra clause saying that for the simplecase all the events in the specified set, end withinthe interval:MP simple':VtV P( simple( t, P)-+ ~I(interval(I)A tE IA Vt'(t' C I--+ ~e(I'.cA 3to(to < t 'Ato  E IA startpt(e, to))A 3tl(t' < tt Atl E IA cn@t(e, t~))))Ve'((P.c'A 9t2(,startpt(e', t2) A t2 C i)--+ Vta(er~,dpt(c', ta))Omitting this extra clause from the MP for perfmeans that the set, of ewmts in question could in-elude one that is not yet complete, so that19 I have also read the Guardian for years, butI am now becoming dissatisfied with it as well.has a past habitual reading which is ()pen to con-timmtion in a way that the habitual reading ofthe simple past cannot be.
The ramifications ofthis require further exploration, perhaps in con-junction with a treatment of implieature, like thai;given in (Gazdar, 1979) to explain why exampleslike (19) generally give rise to the feeling that theevent sequence in question is not yet over and donewith.4 Conc lus ionsThe analysis above of the interaction between thesimple and progressive aspects and various kindsof verb shows that at least some of the phenomenadealt with by (Mo~ins and Steedman, 1988) canbe explained without appealing to actions whichchange the meanings of the lexical and pre-lexicalitems involved.
In the approach outlined here,every sentence reports a set of events.
Aspect, ak-tionsart and temporal modeifiers then provide in-formation which can be used to determine the car-dinality of this set and to draw other conclusionsabout its temporal characteristics.
Each compo-nent of the report is allowed to make a very weakcontribution, and then the interactions betweenthese contributions construct a larger, and moresubtle, set, of conclusions.
The fact that mostsentences report singleton sets of events arises, inthe absence of information to the contrary, by aprocess of implicature, though the adverb once isavailable to reinforce this conclusion if necessary.i have only dealt with a small subset of the rele-vant phenomena here.
It seemed better to use thespace available to explore a small number of casesin some detail than to cover a wider range withoutbeing convincing about any particular case.
Simi-lar analyses of other aspects and other aktionsartsare also easy to devise.
Inventing analyses thatcover specific phenomena is fairly easy.
The diffi-cult part is ensuring that all your analyses workat the same time and without introducing largenuinbers of spurious readings.It is important for my claim to have preservedcompositionality hat all the analyses in this paperhave been obtained on the basis of the interpreta-tions of the lexical items that appear in them andthe semantics of the rules of combination, using aversion of the system described in (Ramsay, 1992;Ramsay and Sch/~ler, 1995).ReferencesAsher, N.
