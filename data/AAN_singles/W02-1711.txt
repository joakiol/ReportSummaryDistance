A Proposal for Screening Inconsistencies in Ontologies based onQuery Languages using WSDChieko NAKABASAMIToyo University1-1-1 Izumino, Itakura,Oura, Gunma, Japan, 374-0193chiekon@itakura.toyo.ac.jpNaoyuki NOMURAHosei University2-17-1 Fujimi, Chiyoda-ku,Tokyo, Japan, 102-8160nomuran@tokyo.email.ne.jpAbstractIn this paper, we discuss a method to screeninconsistencies in ontologies by applying a nat-ural language processing (NLP) technique, es-pecially, those used for word sense disambigua-tion (WSD).
In the database research field, itis claimed that queries over target ontologiesshould play a significant role because they rep-resent every aspect of the terms described ineach ontology.
According to (Calvanese et al,2001), considering the global and the local on-tologies, the terms in the global ontology can beviewed as the query over the local ontology, andthe mapping between the global and the localontologies is given by associating each term inthe global ontology with a view.
On the otherhand, ontology screening systems should be ableto take advantage of some popular techniquesfor WSD, which is supposed to decide the rightsense where the target word is used in a specificcontext.
We present several examples regard-ing inconsistencies in ontologies with the aid ofDAML+OIL notation(DAML+OIL, 2001), andpropose that WSD can be one of the promisingmethod to screen such as inconsistencies.1 IntroductionIn recent years, the semantic web (Berners-Leeet al, 2001) has been evolving as the next-generation web technology and has attractedthe attention of many researchers in databaseand knowledge engineering communities.
Inthe semantic web, contributions obtained fromfields related to databases frequently refer to on-tology maintenance, reuse, and sharing.
Basedon the results from database research, this pa-per proposes a method to screen inconsistenciesin ontologies by applying a natural languageprocessing (NLP) technique, especially, thoseused for word sense disambiguation (WSD).Many reference books on WSD are available(e.g., (Manning and Schutze, 1999)).
As forontology integration, several approarches areproposed (Mitra et al, 2001)(Euzenat, 2001).In (Calvanese et al, 2001), global-centric (akaglobal-as-view) and local-centric (aka local-as-view) approaches for an ontology integrationframework are proposed, respectively.
In thispaper, we support the global-as-view approachfor screening inconsistencies in ontology.
Inaddition, (Calvanese et al, 2001) claims thatqueries over target ontologies should play a sig-nificant role because they represent every as-pect of the terms described in each ontology.The terms in the global ontology can be viewedas the query over the local ontology, which de-scribes a concept definition.
On the other hand,ontology screening systems should be able totake advantage of some popular techniques forWSD, which is supposed to decide the rightsense where the target word is used in a spe-cific context.
We claim that WSD is a promis-ing method for determining which local ontol-ogy should be used for forming concepts for aglobal ontology.
This paper contains a brief in-troduction of the global-centric approach, whichis described in Section 2.
In addition, we men-tion the inconsistencies in ontologies caused bywords with multiple definitions.
For example,the word gbassh is chosen, and we explain thatsome queries based on two of its definitions haveconcepts in the global ontology.
After extract-ing new concepts by querying the global on-tology, each local ontology is illustrated withDAML+OIL (DAML+OIL, 2001).
Several in-consistencies in the ontology are presented inSection 3 over the global ontology, and the WSDfor solving such inconsistencies are discussed.The final section is the conclusion.2 Global-as-view approachIn (Calvanese et al, 2001), global-as-view andlocal-as-view approaches are proposed for on-tology integration.
According to the global-as-view approach, the mapping between the globaland the local ontologies is given by associatingeach term in the global ontology with a view.Let C be a term in the global ontology G, V aquery language over the terms of the local on-tologies, and M the mapping between the globaland the local ontologies.
Given that D is a localmodel for the ontology integration system and Ia global interpretation for the system, the cor-respondence between C and V is specified asfollows by referring to (Calvanese et al, 2001):?
?C, V, sound?if all tuples satisfying V in D satisfy C inI?
?C, V, complete?if no tuple other than those satisfying V inD satisfies C in I?
?C, V, exact?if the set of tuples that satisfy C in I isexactly the set of tuples satisfying V in D.In the above notation, ?I satisfies?
meansthat I satisfies every correspondence in themapping between the global ontology and thelocal ontologies wrt D. These correspondencesare valid if the global ontology is assumed to beconsistent; however, inconsistencies might occurwhen the term in the global ontology has morethan one definition.
We use the word ?bass,?for example, which has at least two definitions,one, ?a man whose singing voice is very low,?and another, ?a kind of fish?
(LDOCE, 1995).Each definition is represented in order with first-order-language-like notation, as follows:C(x) ?
singer(x), voice(x, low).C(x) ?
aKindOf (x, fish).Some concepts in the global ontology are de-scribed using the above two C(x)s. The follow-ing concept is represented with the first C(x) be-cause C1(x) is a member of an orchestra, whichwould be impossible that C1(x) is a fish fromthe standard context.C1(x) ?
C(x), isMemberOf (x, orchestra).
(1)The concept C(x) in (1) can be representedwith the DAML+OIL notation, as shown below.This concept is assumed to belong to one localontology (for example, local-ont-1).
In the rep-resentation, some parts in the representation,such as namespace prefixes and URIs, are omit-ted because they do not directly relate to thispaperfs intention.
In addition, the referencedresources and properties whose definitions arenot in the representation are supposed to be de-fined implicitly.<rdf:RDF><daml:Ontology rdf:about=" "><rdfs:comment>local-ont-1</rdfs:comment></daml:Ontology><daml:Class rdf:ID="bass"><rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#singer"/><hasVoiceOf rdf:resource=#very_low /></daml:Class><daml:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="hasVoiceOf"><rdfs:range rdf:resource="#voice"/></daml:ObjectProperty><daml:Class rdf:ID="voice"><daml:oneOf rdf:parseType="daml:collection"><voice rdf:ID="high/"><voice rdf:ID="medium"/><voice rdf:ID="low"/><voice rdf:ID="very_low"/></daml:oneOf></daml:Class></rdf:RDF>C1(x) is assumed to be a resultfrom a query over the global ontology,?C(x), memberOf (x, orchestra)?
The set ofextensions of C1is returned as a result of thequery.
Once C1is formed, ?x?
as a result of theglobal ontology becomes a set of instances fora new class, and the local ontology is revisedby adding a subclass of the existing class.
Ifsuch a new subclass were named ?sub-bass,?
itwould be represented in this manner:<daml:Class rdf:ID="sub-bass"><subClassOf rdf:resource="#bass"/></daml:Class><daml:Class rdf:about="#sub-bass"><isMemberOf rdf:resource="#orchestra"/></daml:Class>Let O be an ontology screening system.
Inthis case, O obtains one concept ?sub-bass,?i.e., ?a bass singer working at an orches-tra,?
from the intersection between C(x) andisMemberOf (x, orchestra).
The concept ?sub-bass?
is formed by combining the local andglobal ontologies.
Considering this example, ap-propriate extensions of the intended concept inthe global ontology are obtained and recognizedonly if the right sense of the concept in the localontology is used.
A different concept might bedrawn from different senses from other local on-tologies, but the high rate of co-occurrence be-tween singer and orchestra led by WSD wouldplay a crucial role in preventing another sensefrom being considered.
Let?s consider anotherexample:C2(x) ?
C(x), livesIn(x, river).
(2)In (2), x is likely the second sense of ?bass.
?For example, x is an extension of the bass classas a subclass of fish.
WSD would justify it be-cause the co-occurrence of ?fish?
and ?river?is rather strong.
The local ontology of ?bass?from the second sense (local-ont-2) is repre-sented with DAML+OIL, as shown below.
Itis also revised when a new subclass from query(2) is added.<rdf:RDF><daml:Ontology rdf:about=" "><rdfs:comment>local-ont-2</rdfs:comment></daml:Ontology><daml:Class rdf:ID="bass"><rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#fish"/></daml:Class><daml:Class rdf:ID="sub-bass"><subClassOf rdf:resource="#bass"/></daml:Class><daml:Class rdf:about="#sub-bass"><livesIn rdf:resource="#river"/></daml:Class></rdf:RDF>3 Screening inconsistencies in theglobal ontologyAccording to (Calvanese et al, 2001), the fol-lowing situations involving inconsistency or am-biguity occur as a result of the mapping ofglobal and local ontologies:1.
There are no global models.This occurs when the data in the exten-sion of the local ontologies do not satisfythe constraints for functional attributes.For example, in (Calvanese et al, 2001), aproperty ?age?
is considered.
Since ?age?is a function, the value as its range must bedefined with only one value.
However, theglobal ontology does not have a model con-cerning ?age?
any more if ?age?
has morethan one value from the constraint of theconcepts in a local ontology.2.
There are several global models.This occurs when the data in the exten-sion of the local ontologies do not satisfythe ISA relationships of the global ontol-ogy: i.e., several ways exist to add suit-able instances to the elements of the globalontology in order to satisfy the constraintsfrom a local ontology.
For example, it is as-sumed that a ?student?
must be enrolled ina certain university.
More than one univer-sity can be considered when the constraintsin a local ontology do not mention whichuniversity each extension of ?student?
is en-rolled in from the concept definitions of thelocal ontology.
Such ambiguities depend onhow precisely the concepts of a local ontol-ogy are defined.
As a result, all interpreta-tions for an intended ontology integrationsystem within which a valid concept existsmust be accepted as models because of thepotential ambiguities present in local on-tologies.We propose two other solutions to the unsuit-able situations described above; the first relatesto yielding invalid extensions, and the secondto forming wrong concept definitions as a resultof WSD failure.
For an explanation of the firstsituation, consider this example:Example 1.
Re-considering (2) in Section 2.C2(x) ?
C(x), livesIn(x, river).
(3)concept(bass who lives in a river)IchirolivesIn(x,river)hasAddressOf(x,Tokyo)manhasAddressOf()extensionextensionlocal ontologybass(a subclass of singer)local ontologybass(a subclass of fish)bass(x), livesIn(x,river)?wrong choiceglobal ontology?
Tokyo = river?=?
means "same category"Figure 1: An inconsistency resulting from a wrong choice from word ?bass?In (3), concept C2is assumed to be formedfrom concept C, which has the meaning of ?bassas a singer.?
The meaning of C2is ?a bass thatlives in a certain river.?
Provided that ?Ichiro?is an extension of C2, it could be said thatIchiro lives in a river.
In an ontology hierarchy,there would be multiple inheritances around oneterm.
Suppose ?Ichiro?
is also an extension ofthe class ?man.?
If the class ?man?
has a prop-erty called ?isAddressOf,?
which is defined asthe same property of ?livesIn,?
?Ichiro?
musthave an instantiated address.
When his ad-dress is ?Tokyo,?
an inconsistency arises be-cause ?Tokyo?
and ?river?
are not classified inthe same category.
In addition, this inconsis-tency in terms of having an inappropriate valueof properties is propagated towards lower sub-classes of the target class.
This situation is ex-pressed in Figure 1.
We claim that a situationsuch as this should be solved using WSD be-cause of the strong relationship between ?fish?and ?river?
mentioned in Section 2.Example 2.
The second situation concernsWSD failure.
Suppose the following query:C3(x) ?
C(x), hasHobbyOf (x, swimming).
(4)In (4), C3would be assumed to be a conceptreferring to a subclass of person from the ordi-nary context.
However, the ontology screeningsystem might classify the concept C3into thewrong place in the global ontology if it takesthe concept C as the second meaning of ?bass,?i.e., a kind of fish.
Deriving the related conceptsin the global ontology on the basis of a wrongconcept whose meaning is never intersectablewith the right one causes an unexpected incon-sistency over the global ontology.
After C3ismistaken, the local ontology would result in aconcept with the meaning ?a bass whose hobbyis swimming?
in spite of the fact that a bass isa type of fish.<rdf:RDF><daml:Ontology rdf:about=" "><rdfs:comment>local-ont-2</rdfs:comment></daml:Ontology><daml:Class rdf:ID="bass"><rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#fish"/></daml:Class><daml:Class rdf:ID="sub-bass"><subClassOf rdf:resource="#bass"/></daml:Class><daml:Class rdf:about="#sub-bass"><livesIn rdf:resource="#river"/><hasHobbyOf rdf:resource="#swimming"/></daml:Class></rdf:RDF>The above situation has not yet been solvedbecause the strength of the relationship between?fish?
and ?swimming?
is rather high.
In orderto solve such problems, WSD should be appliedto the property names as well as the propertyvalues: i.e., ?hobby.
?4 ConclusionIn this paper, we described a perspective for themapping between the global and the local on-tologies based on (Calvanese et al, 2001).
Wesupport the global-as-view approach for main-taining the global ontology.
This approach isthought to be promising, but it has some un-solved problems concerning inconsistencies inontologies.
Word sense disambiguation, calledWSD, can provide one clue for solving theseproblems because it draws certain close relation-ships among words appearing as property val-ues or concept definitions.
In contrast to (Cal-vanese et al, 2001), we proposed two situationsin which there is ontology inconsistency becauseone word has multiple meanings: the first casewas that of a query based on the wrong choiceof meaning for a word, and the second situa-tion involved the inability to use WSD to de-cide the meaning of a concept.
To solve theseproblems, more precise disambiguation methodsshould be developed in WSD, or more elaboraterepresentations should be provided for the con-straints in ontology definitions.
On the otherhand, the ontology screening system proposedin this paper can be easily implemented us-ing query engines (e.g., (RQL, 1994)(RDFQL,2000)(Miller, 2001)(JENA, 2001) based on RDFQuery (RDFQuery, 1998) as one of the alterna-tives.
A query language must play a crucial rolein the formation of concepts and the screeningfor inconsistencies over intended ontologies.
Inthe semantic web world, we believe that screen-ing for inconsistencies in ontologies will becomecritical and that the use of NLP methods likeWSD to screen for inconsistencies will offer asignificant contribution.ReferencesT.
