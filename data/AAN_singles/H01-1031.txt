Applications that can benefit from such an annotatedcorpus include information extraction (e.g., normalizing temporalreferences for database entry), question answering (answering?when?
questions), summarization (temporally orderinginformation), machine translation (translating and normalizingtemporal references), and information visualization (viewingevent chronologies).KeywordsAnnotation, temporal information, semantics, ISO-8601.1.INTRODUCTIONThe processing of temporal information poses numerouschallenges for NLP.
Progress on these challenges may beaccelerated through the use of corpus-based methods.
This paperintroduces a set of guidelines for annotating time expressions witha canonicalized representation of the times they refer to.Applications that can benefit from such an annotated corpusinclude information extraction (e.g., normalizing temporalreferences for database entry), question answering (answering?when?
questions), summarization (temporally orderinginformation), machine translation (translating and normalizingtemporal references), and information visualization (viewingevent chronologies).Our annotation scheme, described in detail in [Ferro et al 2000],has several novel features:?It goes well beyond the one used in the MessageUnderstanding Conference [MUC7 1998], not only in termsof the range of expressions that are flagged, but, also, moreimportantly, in terms of representing and normalizing thetime values that are communicated by the expressions.
?In addition to handling fully-specified time expressions [e.g.,September 3rd, 1997), it also handles context-dependentexpressions.
This is significant because of the ubiquity ofcontext-dependent time expressions; a recent corpus study[Mani and Wilson 2000] revealed that more than two-thirdsof time expressions in print and broadcast news werecontext-dependent ones.
The context can be local (within thesame sentence), e.g., In 1995, the months of June and Julywere devilishly hot, or global (outside the sentence), e.g., Thehostages were beheaded that afternoon.
A subclass of thesecontext-dependent expressions are ?indexical?
expressions,which require knowing when the speaker is speaking todetermine the intended time value, e.g., now, today,yesterday, tomorrow, next Tuesday, two weeks ago, etc.Our scheme differs from the recent scheme of [Setzer andGaizauskas 2000] in terms of our in-depth focus onrepresentations for the values of specific classes of timeexpressions, and in the application of our scheme to a variety ofdifferent genres, including print news, broadcast news, andmeeting scheduling dialogs.The annotation scheme has been designed to meet thefollowing criteria:Simplicity with precision: We have tried to keep the schemesimple enough to be executed confidently by humans, and yetprecise enough for use in various natural language processingtasks.Naturalness: We assume that the annotation scheme should reflectthose distinctions that a human could be expected to reliablyannotate, rather than reflecting an artificially-defined smaller setof distinctions that automated systems might be expected to make.This means that some aspects of the annotation will be wellbeyond the reach of current systems.Expressiveness:  The guidelines require that one specify timevalues as fully as possible, within the bounds of what can beconfidently inferred by annotators.
The use of ?parameters?
andthe representation of ?granularity?
(described below) are tools tohelp ensure this.Reproducibility: In addition to leveraging the [ISO-8601 1997]format for representing time values, we have tried to ensureconsistency among annotators by providing an example-basedapproach, with each guideline closely tied to specific examples.While the representation accommodates both points and intervals,the guidelines are aimed at using the point representation to theextent possible, further helping enforce consistency.The annotation process is decomposed into two steps: flagging atemporal expression in a document, and identifying the time valuethat the expression designates, or that the speaker intends for it todesignate.
The flagging of temporal expressions is restricted tothose temporal expressions which contain a reserved time wordused in a temporal sense, called a ?lexical trigger?, which includewords like day, week, weekend, now, Monday, current, future, etc.2.
SEMANTIC DISTINCTIONSThree different kinds of time values are represented: points intime (answering the question ?when??
), durations (answering?how long??
), and frequencies (answering ?how often??
).Points in time are calendar dates and times-of-day, or acombination of both, e.g., Monday 3 pm, Monday next week, aFriday, early Tuesday morning, the weekend.
These are allrepresented with values (the tag attribute VAL) in the ISO format,which allows for representation of date of the month, month of theyear, day of the week, week of the year, and time of day, e.g.,<TIMEX2 VAL=?2000-11-29-T16:30?>4:30 p.m. yesterdayafternoon</TIMEX2>.Durations also use the ISO format to represent a period of time.When only the period of time is known, the value is representedas a duration, e.g.,<TIMEX2 VAL=?P3D?>a three-day</TIMEX2> visit.Frequencies reference sets of time points rather than particularpoints.
SET and GRANULARITY attributes are used for suchexpressions, with the PERIODICITY attribute being used forregularly recurring times, e.g., <TIMEX2 VAL=?XXXX-WXX-2?SET=?YES?
PERIODICITY=?F1W?GRANULARITY=?G1D?>every Tuesday</TIMEX2>.
Here?F1W?
means frequency of once a week, and the granularity?G1D?
means the set members are counted in day-sized units.The annotation scheme also addresses several semantic problemscharacteristic of temporal expressions:Fuzzy boundaries.
Expressions like Saturday morning and Fallare fuzzy in their intended value with respect to when the timeperiod starts and ends; the early 60?s is fuzzy as to which part ofthe 1960?s is included.
Our format for representing time valuesincludes parameters such as FA (for Fall), EARLY (for early,etc.
), PRESENT_REF (for today, current, etc.
), among others.For example, we have <TIMEX2 VAL=?1990-SU?>Summer of1990</TIMEX2>.
Fuzziness in modifiers is also represented, e.g.,<TIMEX2 VAL=?1990?
MOD=?BEFORE?>more than adecade ago</TIMEX2>.
The intent here is that a givenapplication may choose to assign specific values to theseparameters if desired; the guidelines themselves don?t dictate thespecific values.Non-Specificity.
Our scheme directs the annotator to represent thevalues, where possible, of temporal expressions that do notindicate a specific time.
These non-specific expressions includegenerics, which state a generalization or regularity of some kind,e.g., <TIMEX2 VAL=?XXXX-04?NON_SPECIFIC=?YES?>April</TIMEX2> is usually wet, andnon-specific indefinites, like <TIMEX2 VAL="1999-06-XX"NON_SPECIFIC="YES?
GRANULARITY="G1D">a sunny dayin <TIMEX2 VAL="1999-06">June</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>.3.
USEFULNESSBased on the guidelines, we have annotated a small referencecorpus, consisting of 35,000 words of newspaper text and 78,000words of broadcast news [TDT2 1999].
Portions of this corpuswere used to train and evaluate a time tagger with a reported F-measure of .83 [Mani and Wilson 2000]; the corpus has also beenused to order events for summarization.Others have used temporal annotation schemes for the much moreconstrained domain of meeting scheduling, e.g., [Wiebe et al1998], [Alexandersson et al 1997], [Busemann et al 1997]; ourscheme has been applied to such domains as well.
In particular,we have begun annotation of the ?Enthusiast?
corpus of meetingscheduling dialogs used at CMU and by [Wiebe et al 1998].
Onlyminor revisions to the guidelines?
rules for tag extent have so farbeen required for these dialogs.This annotation scheme is also being leveraged in the AutomaticContent Extraction (ACE) program of the U.S. Department ofDefense, whose focus is on extraction of time-dependent relationsbetween pairs of ?entities?
(persons, organizations, etc.
).Finally, initial feedback from Machine Translation systemgrammar writers [Levin, personal communication] indicates thatthe guidelines were found to be useful in extending an existinginterlingua for machine translation.4.
CONCLUSIONThe annotation scheme we have developed appears applicable to awide variety of different genres of text.
The semanticrepresentation used is also highly language-independent.
InSpring 2001, we will be embarking on a large-scale annotationeffort using a merged corpus consisting of Enthusiast data as wellas additional TDT2 data (inter-annotator agreement will also bemeasured then).
An initial annotation exercise carried out on asample of this merged corpus by 20 linguistics students using ourguidelines has been encouraging, with 12 of the studentsfollowing the guidelines in a satisfactory manner.
In the future, weexpect to extend this scheme to multilingual corpora.5.
