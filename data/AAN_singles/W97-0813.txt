Inferring Semantic Similarity from Distributional Evidence:an Analogy-based Approach to Word Sense Disambiguation*Ste fano  Feder ic i  lS imonet ta  Montemagn i  1V i to  P i r re l l i  ~IPar.O.La sas, Pisa, ITALY21stituto di Linguist ica Computazionale CNR, Pisa, ITALYAbstractThe paper describes an analogy-based measureof word-sense proximity grounded on distribu-tional evidence in typical contexts, and illus-trates a computational system which makes useof this measure for purposes of lexical disam-biguation.
Experimental results show that word-sense analogy based on contexts of use com-pares favourably with classical word-sensesimilarity defined in terms of thesaural proxim-ity.1 IntroductionSense disambiguation of a given word occurrence in aspecific context (hereafter WSD) requires appeal to awide typology of cues, ranging from syntactic subcate-gorization to lexico-semantic nformation and subjectdomain.
In this paper we will focus on the use of lexico-semantic information, and will try to tackle the relatedproblem of measuring the semantic similarity betweenthe surrounding context of the word to be disarnbiguatedand typical patterns of use of that word in a dictionarydatabase.
In the literature, semantic similarity is usuallyassessed with reference to a hierarchically structuredthesaurus (e.g.
WordNet, \[Miller, 1990\]).
The goal of thepaper is to investigate an alternative way of measuringsemantic similarity, based on distributional evidence,and to show that this evidence can reliably be used todisambiguate words in context.
To this end, we willmake use of textual and lexical resources of Italian:nonetheless we are convinced that the general pointmade in this paper has a cross-linguistic validity.2 Semantic Similarity and WSDMost methods proposed in the literature for establishingthe semantic similarity of words try to map a given word* The work reported in tills paper was jointly earned out by theauthors in the framework ofthe SPARKLE (Shallow PARsing andKnowledge xtraction for Language Engineering) project (LE-2111).
For the specific oncerns of the Italian Academy only, SFederiei is responsible for sections 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5, S. Monte-magni for 2, 3.3 and 4, and V. Pirrelli for 1, 3.1 and 5.in context onto the set of known usages of that word in adictionary database: thesaural information is used as ayardstick for measuring the semantic proximity betweenknown patterns of use and the context to be disambigu-ated.
Eventually, the sense supported by those patternswhich are semantically closer to the context in questionis selected as the most likely one (see, among others,\[Dolan, 1994\], \[Resnik, 1995a, 1995b\], \[Agirre andRigau, 1996\], \[Sanfilippo, 1997\]).Suppose that one wants to disambiguate he sense ofaccendere in the verb-object pair accendere-televlsione'switch on-tv'.
The relevant sense of accendere can beinferred-on the basis of known examples uch as ac-cendere 2-radio 'switch on-radio': this inference issupported by any seman/i'c hierarchy where both radioand television are specified for the same hyperonym, e.g.
'device', whether immediate or not.Thesaural relationships such as hyperonymy and syn-onymy, however, do not always capture the dimensionof similarity relevant o the context in question.
Con-sider the verb accendere in the context accendere-pipa'light-pipe'.
The table below contains typical objects oftwo senses of accendere, 'light' (sense 1) and'switch on' (sense 2) as they are attested in the CollinsItalian-English Dictionary \[1985\], together with theobjects' corresponding hyperonyms according to amonolingual Italian dictionary \[Garzanti, 1984\].90verb senseaccendere_laccenderelaccendere_laccendere_laccendere 2accendere_2accendere 2Tableobjectstgaretta'cigarette'candela'candle'f~ammoeero'match'cammo'fireplace'motore'engine'lampada'lamp'radto'radio'1sthyper.small rolllamp 'small suckhollowdevicesource ofilluminationreceivernth nth+lhyper, hyper.?

Bylooking further up in the semantic hierarchy, somesimilarities are indeed found, but they are based on toogeneral semantic features to be of avail for discriminat-ing among senses 1 and 2 of accendere.We suggest hat, for accendere-pipa to be understoodin the appropriate sense, namely accendere 1 as in ac-cenderel-sigaretta 'light-cigarette', semantTc proximityneed be computed on different grounds.
The relevantsimilarity with links pipes and cigarettes in this specificcontext relates to their both being typically smoked ob-jects, a fact which is orthogonal to their general semanticclass and can be captured on a distributional basis: p:paand sigaretta are distributionally equivalent relative tothe same verb sense, i.e.
they both occur as typical ob-jects of the verb fumare 'smoke'.
Distributional equiva-lence correlates with semantic similarity under the as-sumption that nouns which bear the same syntactic rela-tion to the same verb sense are part-of a semanticallycoherent class.
It turns out that, in examples uch asaccendere-pipa, distributionally-based semantic simi-larities can permit more appropriate sense assignmentswhich are specifically tailored to the context o be dis-ambiguated.
Observe further that also similarities com-monly captured on the basis of thesaural information, asin the case of radio and televtsione above, can in princi-ple be inferred from distributional evidence throughrelevant contexts of use (e.g.
spegnere-radlo'switch off-radio' and spegnere-televtsione 'switch off-tv' in t~ example at hand).Summing up, we contend that thesaural relationshipscapture only some of the various dimensions of word senseanalogy which appear to play a relevant role in the disambi-ugation of word co-occurrence patterns.
In fact, while the-saural relationships are def'med out of context once and forall, effective analogies are to be tailored to the specific con-textual pattern to be disambiguated.
We showed how this canbe attained on the basis of distributional evidence.3 SENSE: a distributionally-basedWSD systemSENSE (Self-Expanding linguistic kNowledge-base forSense Elicitation) is a specialised version of a generalpurpose language-learning system (\[Federici and Pirrelli,1994\]; \[Federici et el., 1996a\]; \[Montemagni et al,1996\]) for carrying out WSD on the basis of distribu-tional evidence.SENSE's inferential routine requires:i) a structured ata set of known word co-occurrencepatterns (WCPs) constituting an Example Base (EB);ii) a target context o be disambiguated (TC);iii)a best-analogue(s) function (BAF) projecting TConto EB for the best analogue(s) to be selected andthus the most likely senses to be identified?3.1 In terna l  a rch i tec ture  of  EBWord co-occurrence patternsWCPs are modelled here as consisting of an input and anoutput level of representation.
At the input level, eachelement of the pattern is described by a set of featureswhich are expected to be of some use for WSD: lemma,part of speech and morpho-syntactic properties (such asthe syntactic function of nouns with respect to the verb)?The output representation simply consists in the ex-pected answer, i.e.
the sense of each element of the pat-tern in the described context.
An example of this type oflinguistic object, illustrating the pattern fumare 1-s:garetta_l/O 'smoke-sigarette', is given in Four!
(On-bekende schakeloptie-instructie.
:Tablefumare_l-slgaretta_ llOinput fumare stgarettaverb nounobjectoutput fumare_l sigaretULlThe input representation is a list of sets of atomic units;each feature set (which is assigned a single column inthe table) describes a distinct element of the pattern.
Inoutput, the list of atomic units "fumare 1" and"sigaretta 1" indicates the senses of the elements in thespecific context?
Elements in the input and output listsare conventionally ordered.In the current version of Italian EB used for our pur-poses, WCPs are verb-noun pairs where the relation ofthe noun to the verb is either subject or object.
Thispresupposes a preliminary stage of morpho-syntacticparsing \[Montemagni, 1995\]: co-occurrence patternsabstract away from actual word forms and are aug-mented with information about grammatical relations.Note that although availability of pre-processed inputmakes word sense disambiguation simpler and moreaccurate, it is in no way a necessary precondition for thetask to be carried out.91Pairwise analogiesThe Italian EB consists of WCPs of the type illustratedin Fout!
Onbekende schakeloptie-instruetie, above.Note however that they are not used as such; rather theyform part of a distributed network ~ which is constructedso as to i) factor out the optimal set of analogies haredby all WCPs in EB, and ii) link the found analogies withtheir corresponding complements relative to the fullWCPs (so-called differing parts).
To make this picturemore concrete, let us consider some simple examples.Given a pair of word co-occurrence patterns wcp, andwcp2, they are judged to be analogous if they share somerepresentation u its at both input and output levels.
Anyshared collection of units of both levels is referred to asan analogical core (or simply core, written wcplnwcp2 ).Suppose that wcp, and wcp2 are fumare 1-slgaretta_l/Oand fumare_l-pzpa_l/O 'smoke-pipe' respectively, de-fined as in Fout!

The core in question is a verb-noun pair where the noun element is specified only atthe input level, for a subset of the features describing thenoun elements in the compared patterns, while nothingbeing said as to the possible sense interpretation of thenoun.
Nonetheless, the information about the noun con-veyed by the core, namely its syntactic relation to theverb, is part of the knowledge supporting the interpreta-tion of the verb asfumare_l: i.e.

When more than one pair of WPCs isconsidered, it may turn out that what is a core relative toa given pair is a remaining part relative to another pair.Suppose that MF maps fumare_l-stgaretta_l/O (wept)onto accendere_l-szgarettal/O (wep3).

An (unoriented) arc connecting two nodesexpresses their "complementarity", i.e.

By contrast, no direct connection is ~b-92served between accendere_l-object and plpa_l, to sig-nify that no corresponding pattern is attested in EB.Remaining parts which are connected with the same coreare said to be contrastive, since, by replacing one withthe other, different WCPs are obtained.
A graph like theone in Foutt Onbekende sehakeloptie-instructie, rep-resents in our terms an analogical family (AF).
Clearly,far more extended AFs than the one in Fout!
Onbek-ende sehakeloptie-instructie, can be found.Among the WPCs of the AF in Fout!
Onbekendeschakeloptie-instructie., fumare_l-sigaretta_l/O is theonly one which is made up out of two cores, namelywcpln wcp3 and wcpln wcp3.
Due to its pivotal positionin the graph, it is some times useful to refer to it as the"hook pattern", or more simply "hook", of the AF inquestion.
Accordingly, we will call the noun collocate ofa hook, i.e.
stgaretta_l in the example at hand, "hooknoun", and the corresponding verb, i.e.
fumare_l, "hookverb".
Note further that the hook noun stgaretta_l isfunctional to establishing a kinship between the verbsenses fumare_l and accendere_l, since it denotes anon-empty intersection between typical patterns of theiruse.3.2 The Best -ana logue(s )  Funct ionUnlike linguistic objects in EB, which are specified fortwo representation levels (input and output), a TargetContext (TC) is specified at the input level only, sinceits sense is precisely what the system has to predict onthe basis of the available knowledge.This prediction is carried out through operation of thebest-analogue(s) function (BAF) which projects TC ontoEB, searching for TC's best candidate analogue(s).
BAFuses the notion of distributionally-driven word-senseanalogy developed in the previous pages, and can beinformally described through the following steps:a) if EB contains a pattern wcp, which fully matches TC.
at the input level, then wcp, is the best analogue andits output is ranked first in the list of available an-swers; note that this step does not stop SENSE fromcontinuing its search;b) if EB contains a single AF such that two of AF'snodes together cover TC's input representation in itsentirety, the output representations a sociated withthe matching nodes is added to the list of availableanswers with a ranking score, gauged as a function oftype and quantity of supporting evidence (see belowfor more detail);c) if steps a) and b) yield no result, no output is pro-vided by SENSE.BAF at workLet us look at some interesting cases of BAF at work.Note that all examples considered in this paper are rep-resentative of real test suites of SENSE, and the assumedknowledge in EB reflects the current status of an actualdata base acquired from typical examples of use withinverb entries of the Collins Italian-English dictionary\[1985\].Suppose that SENSE has to assign a verb sense in thetarget context accendere?-ptpa_l/O 'light-pipe'.
Thecontext being not attested in EB, TC is projected ontoEB's network, for a relevant AF to be found.
The AF inFout!
Onbekende sehakeloptie-instructie, above is agood instance of such a relevant family, since it containstwo nodes, namely accendere_l-object and plpa_l,which fully cover TC's input.
Step a) having failed, thetwo nodes in question are not directly connected; none-theless, their belonging to the same family means thatthere exists a continuous path of complementarity arcsjoining the two.
This continuity allows SENSE to hy-pothesize an arc directly connecting accendere_l-objectwith pzpa_l (represented asa dashed line in Font!
On-bekende schakeloptie-instructie, below):fumare_l-objeet o~.
/ " ' /e  pzpa laccendere l-objeet i ' / ' /~  s:garetta_lFigure A reconstructed connectioni.e.
the co-occurrence pattern accendere_l-ptpa_l/O canbe reconstructed on the basis of the available distribu-tional evidence, and supports the interpretation ac-cendere 1.To sum up, SENSE identifies a distributional similaritybetween accenderel and fumare_l: this similarity is basedon the fact that cigarettes can both be lit and smoked.
Thistriggers the analogy-based inference that pipes, besides beingsmoked, can also be lit, thus supporting the interpretation ofaccendere 13.3 Const ra in ts  on d i s t r ibut iona i ly -basedWSDIn the example illustrated above, nouns stand in thesame syntactic relation to the verbs.
However, it is oftenthe case that clusters of nouns which function as theobject of a given verb can function as typical subjects ofother, somehow related, verbs.
If this sort of systematicsubject/object alternation is taken into account, the in-ferential power of distributionally-based WSD may in-crease considerably, as shown by the following exam-pies.Consider the TC attaccare_?-fotografial/O'hang_up-photograph'.
EB contains three differentsenses of attaccare, each attested with the following setsof noun collocates:?
attaccare_l-\[francobollo_l/O, manifesto_l/O,quadro_l /O \]' hang_up'- \['stamp/O', 'poster/O', painting/O'\]?
attaccare_2-\[dtscorso_l/O\]'start'-\['conversation/O'\]?
attaccare_4-\[moda_l/S\]' catch_on'- \[' fashion/S' \]No one of the noun collocates listed above happens to beattested in EB as an object of verbs which also combine93with fotografia as an object.
However, if the restrictionthat relevant nouns must stand in the same relation to thepredicate is relaxed, then relevant distributional evi-dence can in fact be found in EB.
Fotografia and quadro'painting' are both attested as typical subjects of theverb rappresentare_l, a fact which can be interpreted interms of Pustejovsky's telic role \[Pustejovsky 1995\],since both nouns are normally used to "show some-thing".
Furthermore, quadro is also attested as a typicalobject of the verb attaccare_l; on this basis, it can rea-sonably be supposed that also fotografia, when co-occurring as an object of attaccare, points to the senseattaccare 1.Inferences based on AFs involving asymmetric syn-tactic dependencies permit o exploit the data containedin EB to the full.
Moreover, the procedure becomes es-sential for generalising over cases of so-called valencyalternation.
Consider the causative-inchoative alterna-tion, which involves two argument structures, a transi-tive and an intransitive one: a verb such as aumentare'increase' can be used in a sentence like la Fiat haaumentato gh stipendl agh operat 'Fiat increased sala-ries to workers', where stipendio is the object of theverb, and in a sentence like gh snpendt aumentaronoinaspettatamente 'salaries increased unexpectedly',where sttpendio is the subject.
In the literature, the theo-retical issue of whether alternating argument structuresof the same verb should be associated with a uniquesense or with different senses of that verb is still open.In practice, lexicographers' approaches vary considera-bly, depending on factors such as the dictionary's inter-nal structure or main practical purpose: for instance, inbilingual dictionaries different but alternating argumentstructures often give rise to different senses, due to dif-ferences in their translation.
Whatever approach isadopted by the lexicographer, however, SENSE is capa-ble of identifying a sense alternation induced by an al-ternation of argument structure, or~ alternatively, ofrecognising two different argument structures as relatedto the same verb sense, thanks to its ability to deal withasymmetric syntactic dependencies in EB.To sum up, word sense disambiguation with verb-noun pairs involving asymmetric dependencies is moreeffective than when only contexts with symmetric de-pendencies are considered.
This procedure is particularlycrucial for verbs alternating between different argumentsstructures.3.4 Beyond attested evidenceSENSE's inferential routine can go beyond attested evi-dence; in fact, the presence of an attested pattern whichmatches exactly TC's input does not prevent he systemfrom exploring other hypotheses.
This flexibility is oftenuseful: when sense distinctions are fine grained and datain EB are sparse, distributional criteria get too coarsegrained to be able to point to a unique sense interpreta-tion.Consider, for example, battere ?-mano_l/O 'hit-hand': in EB, this pattern is attested with the sense ofclapping, as an instance of beating body parts with aregular rhythm (battere_3).
However, there is at leastanother sense of battere which is appropriate in thecontext considered, namely battere_l, understood underthe more general sense of hitting someone or something.In cases like this one, SENSE "ambiguates" the verb-noun pair received in input, by finding out other plausi-ble sense assignments besides the one attested in EB.
Asa consequence, SENSE outputs more than one senseinterpretation, while ranking the attested interpretationfirst.
Identification of alternative sense assignments,although with lower ranking, comes in handy when theexpected TC interpretation is not the attested one.
This isreasonable, we believe, since WSD is often a matter ofsuggesting a set of more or less plausible interpretationsin context rather than asserting one interpretation only;by taking attested evidence (no matter how representa-tive) at face value one would wrongly ignore the com-mon fact that, even in real usages, atarget context can infact be understood in more than one way.3.5 Ranking multiple disambiguation re-sultsAs just shown, distributlonally-based word sense disam-biguation does not always make the system converge ona unique interpretation.
This situation typically occurswhen different senses of a word are close in meaning,and this closeness is reflected by their co-occurrencewith distributionally similar if not identical words.
Whenmore than one sense interpretation appears to be plausi-ble, different strategies can be followed in order to rankthem from more to less likely.
When the set of plausibleinterpretations includes a directly attested one, then thelatter is always ranked first.
Ranking of inferred inter-pretations needs to take into account a number of differ-ent factors.As a first approximation, different sense interpretations canbe ranked according to the number of AFs supporting them.Suppose that SENSE has to assign a verb sense in accarez-zare_?-speranza_I/O 'toy_with-hope'.
Both possiblesense interpretations of accarezzare (i.e.
accarezzare 1'stroke' and accarezzare2 'toy_with') are supported.
In EB,the interpretation accarezzare_l is supported by one AF only,which includes the pattern perderel-capellol/O 'lose-hair'.On the other hand accarezzare2 is supported by four AFs,each containing the following hooks:1. abbandonare_4-progetto_l/O 'giveup-project'2.
cullare 1-tdea 1/0 'cherish-idea'3.
nascere 2-tdea_l/S 'be_born-idea'4.
nau~agare 1-progetto_I/S 'fall~hrough-project'Hence, accarezzare2 gets score 4 and wins out over ac-carezzare I which scores 1.The sheer number of supporting AFs, however, is too grossa criterion when used on its own.
Consider the target af-fluire?-acqua_l/S 'flow-water'.
Here, the contextually moreappropriate sense affluwel 'flow' is supported by three AFs,while affluwe2 'pourin' is pointed to by five different AFs:af~uire l941.
intorbtdare_l-liqutda-1/O ' cloud-liquid'2.
penetrare 2-1iquido_l/S 'percolate-liquid'3.
versare_2-liqutdo_l/O'pour-liquid'affluire_21.
conflutre_l-persona_l/S 'join-person'2.
gettare 1-persona_1/O 'rush_in-person'3.
imbarcare_l-mercel/O 'ship-goods'4.
insinuarsi_3-persona_l/S 'creep_into-person'5.
ristagnare_l-persona_l/S 'lag_person'Nonetheless, SENSE could be "persuaded" toprefer the cor-rect interpretation if also the typology of supporting evidenceis taken into account.
Intuitively, preference has to be given tomore specific supporting semantic evidence over semanticallyvaguer one.
In our terms, this means that supporting AFswhich contain a more specific hook noun should carry moreweight for WSD than AFs containing vaguer hook nouns.Usually, generality of a word is measured by referring toa semantic hierarchy.
In this context we have used fre-quency of word occurrence in EB as a convenient measure of"generality/specificity" of a word: the more often a hooknoun occurs as a subject/object of differents verbs in EB, themore general it can be considered.
Note that EB contains onlyWCP types, so that word counting here is significantly differ-ent from counting token frequencies in a real text; type fre-quency appears to point more decisively to the general struc-ture of lexical competence, rather than to distributional effectsin language performance.
On this basis, each relevant AF isassigned a specificity score, equal to the inverse ratio of thenumber of times its hook noun occurs in EB.
The rankingscore of a given sense interpretation S is then the sum of thespecificity scores of all AFs = { AFt, AF~ ..... AF, } support-ing it:Ss~>~,~ = Spec(AF0+ Spec(AF2)+...+ Spec(AF,)where Spec(AF,)= 1/type-frequency(hook_noun).ha the light of this score, :ranking of the senses of affluwe isreversed: the best disambiguation hypothesis is now aJ:flutre_l (ranking score 0.281046), against afflutre_2 whoseranking score 0.069598 is significantly lower.
The hook nounsupporting the sense affluire_l is hqutdo 'liquid', whosespecificity score is 0.111111 when used as an object and0.058824 when used as a subject.
By contrast, he same scoreis significantly lower in the cases upporting the other sense:0.007194 for persona_l/O and 0.005650 for personal~S;0.045455 for merce 1/0.The specificity score tends to overrate very specific analo-gies, that is analogies upported by analogical families withhighly idiosynractic collocates, over more general analogies.To counterbalance this bias, another ranking factor, called the"coverage" score, can usefully be exploited in our context.For each available sense interpretation of TC attested in EB,we count how many of its collocates occur as hook nouns ofall AFs supporting that sense.
Note that, for an AF to supporta certain verb sense, it has to contain as a hook noun a collo-cate of the verb sense S in question.
We then assign to S acoverage score S~ov~:~o~, which is proportional tothe num-ber of shared collocates:S,~w~e ~ = # nour~collocate(AF(S))/#noun c llocate(S)where '# nout~collocate(AF(S))' reads "cardinality of thenoun collocates of the AFs supporting S", and'# nouncollocate(S)' reads "cardinality of the noun collo-cates of S".
The bigger this score, the more widely supportedthe corresponding sense interpretation i  EB.
This followsquite naturally in an analogy-based perspective, since, intui-tively, two verb senses are considered more similar if theyhave more collocates in common.
Eventually, this score iscombined with the other scores considered above to yield afmal ranking score:S lo~1 ~nS_~or~ = Ssr~:o~ x S~ov~gn_~r~To give a concrete xample, assume that SENSE has to inter-pret the pattern accostare?-qualcuno_l/O 'approach-somebody'.
Accostare is attested in EB in three differentsenses: accostare_l 'bring_near' with words like chair, objectand ladder, among its typical objects; accostare2 'approach'with person as typical object; accostare3 'setajar' said ofshutter and door.
If the coverage score is not considered, theranking would be accostare 3 (0.428571), accostare 1(0.316417), accostare2 (0.12~02) the latter being the ap-propriate sense in this context.
Intuitively this is due to thefact, that, for example, the AFs supporting accostare 3 allexhibit one hook noun only, namely porta, which none~elesscontributes a high specificity score, due to its poor type-frequency in EB.
Yet, if the coverage score is taken into ac-count, the ranking becomes accostare 2 (2.079136), ac-costarel (1.582087), accostare3 (0.4~571), with the ap-propriate sense ranked first.4 SENSE:  exper imenta l  resultsExperiments have been carried out with an EB of 8,153distinct verb-noun patterns (2,488 verb-subject, 5,665verb-object) automatically extracted from the whole setof verb entries of the Collins bilingual Italian-Englishdictionary \[Montemagni, 1995\].
In these patterns onlyverbs are disambiguated asto their sense, whereas nounsare assigned all possible senses.
These patterns exem-plify 3,359 different verb senses, each illustrated, onaverage, through 2.42 patterns.

In thesecond column, recall and precision are relative topolysemous verbs only, and in spite of an obvious de-crease compare well with related work carried out withdifferent methods (see, for instance, \[Agirre and Rigau,1996\]), and are in fact very promising if one considersthe comparatively small size of EB, and that only part ofits attested words are semantically disambiguated.5 Concluding remarksIn this paper we described a WSD system which uses anotion of semantic similarity based on distributionalevidence.
Prehminary results look promising.The described measure of semantic similarity offerssignificant advantages compared with methods whereword similarity is evaluated either in statistical terms,ultimately based on token frequency, or through refer-ence to a hierarchically structured thesaurus.
First, goodresults are achieved with small quantities of data, part ofwhich are not even semantically disambiguated.
Second,the suggested measure is sensitive to similarities'whichare relevant o the context being disambiguated, thusovercoming one of the major drawbacks of fixed decon-textualised semantic hierarchies.On a more practical front, this measure was evaluatedas an integral part of the disambiguation strategy ofSENSE, whose main advantages over other WSD sys-tems can be summarised as follows:?
SENSE does not take attested evidence at face valuebut always entertains other hypotheses;?
SENSE's inferences are not restricted to contextswhich exhibit symmetric syntactic dependencies, butalso exploit alternations in argument surface realisa-tion with semantically related verbs;?
SENSE is sensitive to the semantic general-ity/specificity of supporting evidence.References\[Agirre and Rigau, 1996\] E. Agirre, G. Rigau.
