To make a revision of AsianWordNet which is automatically generatedby using the existing English translationdictionary, we propose an online collabora-tive tool which can organize multiple trans-lations.
To support the work of syntacticdependency tree annotation, we develop anediting suite which integrates the utilitiesfor word segmentation, POS tagging anddependency tree into a sequence of editing.1 IntroductionThough WordNet was already used as a startingresource for developing many language WordNets,the constructions of the WordNet for languagescan be varied according to the availability of thelanguage resources.
Some were developed fromscratch, and some were developed from the combi-nation of various existing lexical resources.This paper presents an online collaborative toolparticularly to facilitate the construction of theAsian WordNet which is automatically generatedby using the existing resources having only Eng-lish equivalents and the lexical synonyms.In addition, to support the work of syntactic de-pendency tree annotation, we develop an editingsuite which integrates the utilities for word seg-mentation, POS tagging and dependency tree.
Thetool is organized in 4 steps, namely, sentence se-lection, word segmentation, POS tagging, and syn-tactic dependency tree annotation.The rest of this paper is organized as follows:Section 2 describes the collaborative interface forrevising the result of synset translation.
Section 3describes the tool for annotating Thai syntacticdependency tree corpus.
And, Section 4 concludesour work.2 Collaborative Tools for Asian WordNetConstructionThere are some efforts in developing Wordnets forsome of Asian languages, e.g.
Chinese, Japanese,Korean, and Hindi.
The number of languages thathave been successfully developed their Wordnetsis still limited to some active research in the area.However, the extensive development of Wordnetin other languages is of the efforts to support theNLP research and implementation.
It is not only tofacilitate the implementation of NLP applicationsfor the language, but also provide an inter-linkageamong the Wordnets for different languages to de-velop multi-lingual applications.We adopt the proposed criteria for automaticsynset assignment for Asian languages which haslimited language resources.
Based on the resultfrom the above synset assignment algorithm, weintroduce KUI (Knowledge Unifying Initiator),(Sornlertlamvanich et al, 2007) to establish anonline collaborative work in refining the WorNets.KUI is a community software tool which allowsregistered members including language experts torevise and vote for the synset assignment.
The sys-tem manages the synset assignment according tothe preferred score obtained from the revisionprocess.
As a result, the community-based Word-Nets will be accomplished and exported into theoriginal form of WordNet database.
Via the synsetThe 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008105ID assigned in the WordNet, the system can gener-ate a cross language WordNet.
Through this effort,a translated version of Asian WordNet can be es-tablished.Table 1 shows a record of WordNet displayedfor translation in KUI interface.
English entry to-gether with its part-of-speech, synset, and gloss areprovided if exists.
The members will examine theassigned lexical entry and decide whether to votefor it or propose a new translation.Car[Options]POS : NOUNSynset : auto, automobile, machine, motorcarGloss : a motor vehicle with four wheels; usually propelledby an internal combustion engine;Table 1.

Statistics of the progress as well as manyuseful functions such as item search, chat, and listof online participants are also provided to under-stand the progress of work and to work online withother members.3 Tool for Constructing a Syntactic De-pendency Tree Annotated CorpusThe tool is organized in 4 steps, namely, sentenceselection, word segmentation, POS tagging, andsyntactic dependency tree annotation, shown inFigure 2.
Sentence segmentation is yet anothercrucial issue for the Thai language.
We, however,will not discuss about the issue in this work.
Theinput is already a list of sentences provided for an-notator to select.Figure 2.
Syntactic Dependency Tree Annotation3.1 POS AnnotationThe result from the automatic word segmentationand POS tagging program is generated with alter-native POSs for revision.
A dropdown list of POSsis provided for annotator to correct the POS.
Sinceword segmentation is processed together with POStagging, the annotator is also provided a GUI tomerge or to divide the proposed word unit.3.2 Syntactic Dependency Tree AnnotationThe result from POS annotation in Section 3.1 ispassed to define the syntactic dependency betweenwords.
The dependency is assigned to form aphrase and a sentence respectively.
The final out-put will be marked in the XML manner and shownas a tree for confirmation.4 ConclusionOur current work on the web-based collaborativetool for Asian WordNet construction and tool forSyntactic Dependency Tree Annotation are devel-oped as an open platform for online contribution.A user-friendly interface and self-organizing utili-ties are intentionally prepared to support the onlinecollaborative work.ReferencesVirach Sornlertlamvanich, Thatsanee Charoenporn,Kergit Robkop, and Hitoshi Isahara.
