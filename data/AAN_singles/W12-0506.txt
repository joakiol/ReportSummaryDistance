Proceedings of the Workshop on Innovative Hybrid Approaches to the Processing of Textual Data (Hybrid2012), EACL 2012, page 45,Avignon, France, April 23 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsInvited talk presentationMultilingual Natural Language ProcessingRada MihalceaUniversity of North TexasUSArada@cs.unt.eduTitleMultilingual Natural Language ProcessingAbstractWith rapidly growing online resources, such asWikipedia, Twitter, or Facebook, there is an in-creasing number of languages that have a Webpresence, and correspondingly there is a growingneed for effective solutions for multilingual natu-ral language processing.
In this talk, I will explorethe hypothesis that a multilingual representationcan enrich the feature space for natural languageprocessing tasks, and lead to significant improve-ments over traditional solutions that rely exclu-sively on a monolingual representation.
Specif-ically, I will describe experiments performed onthree different tasks: word sense disambiguation,subjectivity analysis, and text semantic similarity,and show how the use of a multilingual represen-tation can leverage additional information fromthe languages in the multilingual space, and thusimprove over the use of only one language at atime.
