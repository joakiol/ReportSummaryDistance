Semantic Tagging and NLP ApplicationsTh ier ry  Dec le rck  & Jud i th  K le inDFK I  GmbH(German Research Center for Artificial Intell igence){declerck; k lein}@dfki ,  uni-sb, deThere are hardly any an_notation schemes including semantic information, with the exception of PrincetonWordNet (which will be extended by EuroWordNet for European languages).
But some projects alreadyaddressed this topic, like FraCaS (Framework for Computational Semantics), or are starting to do this, likeDIET (Diagnostic and Evaluation Tools for NL Applications, an extension of the TSNLP framework, seeLehmann et al, Coling 96) 1.What makes semantic tagging appealing is, among others, the (justified) hope that it will contribute tothe improvement of the performances and the robustness of NLP systems.
Besides this aspect, evaluationwill also benefit from semantically tagged test corpora.In this working session, we focus on both the question how semantic tagging can support he developmentof NLP applications and, the other way round, how NLP systems can support semantic tagging.
Among thedifferent NLP projects making a (limited) use of semantic annotations, we are aiming at common annotationmethodologies beyond particular approaches.As an example we describe a scenario which has been adopted within the context of a NLP project con-cerned with appointment sched~lling (COSMA, see Bnsem~_nn etal., ANLP 97), where information extractiontechniques combined with a shallow-parsing strategy (see Neumann, ANLP 97) have been used in order toprocess just the relevant fragments of input texts.To support the development of the system and to delimit the linguistic coverage of the NLP  application, asmall corpus has been semantically hand-tagged, where the semantic annotations have been added to themainly syntactic annotation scheme of the TSNLP  framework.
Thus the evaluation tool of TSNLP  has beenextended by a certain class of semantic information (non-ambiguous temporal expressions).
Furthermore theFST  automata developed for the purpose of messag e extraction have been designed along the lines of thisannotation scheme.
And the output of the FST automata has been defined in such a way that they can beused for an automatic (rule-based) semantic annotation of new text input (the annotation being limited tothe temporal expression).Other NLP  applications could reuse such a simple annotation in order to determlne, for example, selectionalrestrictions or text classifications.
Addressing the reusability of annotation schemes for particular domains,one will have to consider if they can be just added to existing morpho-syntactic annotation schemes, as wedescribed in the example above, or if the annotation work should be started from scratch, which could benecessary for more complex applications.
A recently developed annotation scheme (see Skut et al, ANLP  97)is proposing an architecture with multiple levels of linguistic representation, for argument structure, gram-matical function and syntactic category.
We will investigate how semantic information can be integrated insuch a framework and if the bidirectional interface between semantic tagging and NLP  system, describedabove, can be adopted to this architecture.1We just mention here some projects funded by the CEC.90
