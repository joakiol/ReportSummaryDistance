We apply our approach to German noun compounds and particleverbs within a German?English SMT system, and study the effect of only splitting compositionalcompounds as opposed to an aggressive splitting.
A qualitative study explores the translationalbehaviour of non-compositional compounds.1 IntroductionIn German, as in many other languages, two (or more) simplex words can be combined to form a com-pound.
This is a productive process, leading to a potentially infinite number of sound German com-pounds.
As a consequence, many NLP applications suffer from coverage issues for compounds whichdo not appear or appear only infrequently in language resources.
However, while many compounds arenot covered, their component words are often found in lexical resources or training data.
Compoundprocessing allows access to these component words and thus can overcome these sparsity issues.We use Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) as an example application for compound processing.Our SMT system translates from German to English, where compounds are usually split in the Germansource language prior to training and decoding.
The benefits are obvious: vocabulary size is reducedand the languages are adjusted in terms of granularity, as exemplified by the compound Holzzaun.
ThisfencewoodenHolzzaun HolzZaun woodenfence1:1 alignment1:n alignmentresults in better alignment quality and model estimation.Compound splitting also enables the translation of com-pounds not occurring in the parallel data, if the parts havebeen seen and can thus be translated individually.
However, these assumptions only hold for compo-sitional compounds like Holzzaun (?wooden fence?
), whose meanings can be derived from the mean-ings of their constituents, namely Holz (?wood?)
and Zaun (?fence?).
In contrast, the splitting of non-compositional compounds may lead to translation errors: e.g.
the meaning of J?agerzaun (?lattice fence?
)cannot be represented by the meanings of its constituents J?ager (?hunter?)
and Zaun (?fence?).
Here, anerroneous splitting of the compound can lead to wrong generalizations or translation pairs, such as J?ager?
lattice, in the absence of other evidence about how to translate J?ager.
When splitting compoundsfor SMT, two important factors should thus be considered: (1) whether a compound is compositionaland should be split, and if so (2) how the compound should be split.
Most previous approaches mainlyfocused on the second task, how to split a compound, e.g.
using frequency statistics (Koehn and Knight,2003) or a rule-based morphology (Fritzinger and Fraser, 2010), and all of them showed improved SMTquality for compound splitting.
The decision about whether the compound is compositional and shouldbe split at all has not received much attention in the past.In this work, we examine the effect of only splitting compositional compounds, in contrast to splittingall compounds.
To this end, we combine (A) an approach relying on the distributional similarity be-tween compounds and their constituents, to predict the degree of compositionality and thus to determinewhether to split the compound with (B) a combination of morphological and frequency-based featuresThis work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

We experiment with this novel semantically-informed compoundsplitting on the source-side data of a German-English SMT system.
As far as we know, we are the firstto study the impact of compositionality-aware compound splitting in SMT.
We evaluate our systems ona standard and on a specifically created test set, both for noun compounds and particle verbs.
Our re-sults show that phrase-based SMT is generally robust with regard to over-splitting non-compositionalcompounds, with the exception of low-frequency words.
This is in line with corresponding assumptionsfrom previous work.
Furthermore, we present a small-scale study about the translational behaviour ofnon-compositional compounds, which can surprisingly often be translated component-wise.2 Related WorkWe combine morphology-based compound splitting with distributional semantics to improve phrase-based SMT.
Here, we discuss relevant work of compound splitting in SMT and distributional semantics.2.1 Compound Splitting in SMTCompound splitting in SMT is a well-studied task.
There is a wide range of previous work, includingpurely string- and frequency-based approaches, but also linguistically-informed approaches.
All linesof research improved translation performance due to compound splitting.
In Koehn and Knight (2003),compounds are split through the identification of substrings from a corpus.
The splitting is performedwithout linguistic knowledge (except for the insertion of the filler letters ?(e)s?
), which necessarily leadsto many erroneous splittings.
Multiple possible splitting options are disambiguated using the frequenciesof the substrings.
Starting from Koehn and Knight (2003), Stymne (2008) covers more morphologicaltransformations and imposes POS constraints on the subwords.
Nie?en and Ney (2000) and Fritzingerand Fraser (2010) perform compound splitting by relying on morphological analysers to identify suitablesplit points.
This has the advantage of returning only linguistically motivated splitting options, but theanalyses are often ambiguous and require disambiguation: Nie?en and Ney (2000) use a parser forcontext-sensitive disambiguation, and Fritzinger and Fraser (2010) use corpus frequencies to find the bestsplit for each compound.
Other approaches use a two-step word alignment process: first, word alignmentis performed on a split representation of the compounding language.
Then, all former compound partsfor which there is no aligned counterpart in the non-compounding language are merged back to thecompound again.
Finally, word alignment is re-run on this representation.
See Koehn and Knight (2003)for experiments on German, DeNeefe et al.
(2008) for Arabic and Bai et al.
(2008) for Chinese.
Thisblocks non-compositional compounds from being split if they are translated as one simplex English wordin the training data (e.g.
Heckensch?utze, lit.
?hedge|shooter?
; ?sniper?)
and aligned correctly.
However,cases like J?agerzaun, ?lattice fence?
are not covered.In the present work, we identify compounds with a morphological analyser, disambiguated with corpusfrequencies.
Moreover, we restrict splitting to compositional compounds using distributional semantics.We are not aware of any previous work that takes semantics into account for compound splitting in SMT.2.2 Distributional Semantics and CompoundingDistributional information has been a steadily increasing, integral part of lexical semantic research overthe past 20 years.
Based on the distributional hypothesis (Firth, 1957; Harris, 1968) that ?you shall knowa word by the company it keeps?, distributional semantics exploits the co-occurrence of words in corporato explore the meanings and the similarities of the words, phrases, sentences, etc.
of interest.Among many other tasks, distributional semantic information has been utilised to determine the degreeof compositionality (or: semantic transparency) of various types of compounds, most notably regardingnoun compounds (e.g., Zinsmeister and Heid (2004), Reddy et al.
(2011), Schulte im Walde et al.
(2013),Salehi et al.
(2014)) and particle verbs (e.g., McCarthy et al.
(2003), Bannard (2005), Cook and Stevenson(2006), K?uhner and Schulte im Walde (2010), Bott and Schulte im Walde (2014), Salehi et al.
(2014)).Typically, these approaches rely on co-occurrence information from a corpus (either referring to bags-of-words, or focusing on target-specific types of features), and compare the distributional features ofthe compounds with those of the constituents, in order to predict the degree of compositionality of the82OutputInputPreprocessingStep 1:   Identify Component Words Similarity ScoresStep 2:  Predict sitional CompoundsStep 3: Split Compo?0.3110.8250.0150.725Holzzaun woodenfenceHolzZaun ZaunHolzJ?gerzaun lattice fenceJ?gerZaun J?gerzaunSMTFigure 1: Semantically-informed compound processing in SMT.compound.
The underlying assumption is that a compound which is similar in meaning to a constituent(as in Holzzaun?Zaun (?wooden fence???fence?)
but not in L?owenzahn?Zahn (?lion|tooth (dandelion)???tooth?))
is also similar to the constituent with regard to co-occurrence information.Most related to this work on noun compounds, Reddy et al.
(2011) relied on window-based distribu-tional models to predict the compositionality of English noun compounds, and Schulte im Walde et al.
(2013) compared window-based against syntax-based distributional models to predict the composition-ality of German noun compounds.
Zinsmeister and Heid (2004) used subcategorising verbs to predictcompound?head similarities of German noun compounds.
Most recently, Salehi et al.
(2014) extendedthe previous approaches to take multi-lingual co-occurrence information into account, regarding Englishand German noun compounds, and English particle verbs.3 MethodologyWe integrate our semantically-informed compound splitting as a pre-processing step to the Germansource language of an SMT system.
See Figure 1 for an illustration of our compound processing pipeline.3.1 Target CompoundsGerman compounds are combinations of two (or more) simplex words.
In some cases, a morphologicaltransformation is required: for example, when combining the two nouns Ausflug (?excursion?)
and Ziel(?destination?)
?
Ausflugsziel (?excursion destination?
), a filler letter (here: ?s?)
needs to be inserted.Other such transformations include more filler letters or the deletion/substitution of letters.Noun compounds are formed of a head noun and a modifier, which can consist of nouns, verbs, adjec-tives or proper nouns.Particle verbs are productive compositions of a base verb and a prefix particle, whose part-of-speechvaries between open-class nouns, adjectives, and verbs, and closed-class prepositions and adverbs.
Incomparison to noun compounds, the constituents of German particle verbs exhibit a much higher degreeof ambiguity: Verbs in general are more ambiguous than nouns, and the largest sub-class of particles(those with a preposition particle) is highly ambiguous by itself (e.g.
Lechler and Ro?deutscher (2009)and Springorum (2011)).
For example, in anknabbern (?to nibble partially?
), the particle an expresses apartitive meaning , whereas in ankleben (?to glue onto sth.?)
an has a topological meaning (to glue sth.onto an implicit background).
In addition, particle verb senses may be transparent or opaque with respectto their base verbs.
For example, abholen ?fetch?
is rather transparent with respect to its base verb holen?fetch?, whereas anfangen ?begin?
is more opaque with respect to fangen ?catch?.
In contrast, einsetzenhas both transparent (e.g.
?insert?)
and opaque (e.g.
?begin?)
verb senses with respect to setzen ?put/sit(down)?.
The high degree of ambiguity makes particle verbs a challenge for NLP.
Moreover, particleand base verb can occur separately (er f?angt an: ?he begins?)
or in one word (dass er anf?angt: ?that hebegins?
), depending on the clausal type.
This makes consistent treatment of particle verbs difficult.3.2 Identification of Component PartsWe use the rule-based morphological analyser SMOR (Schmid et al., 2004) to identify compounds andtheir constituents in our parallel training data (cf.
Section 4).
It relies on a large lexicon of word lemmasand feature rules for productive morphological processes in German, i.e., compounding, derivation and83inflection.
In this paper, we will not consider splitting into derivational affixes (as needed for, e.g., Arabicand Turkish), but instead identify simplex words that may also occur independently.
Moreover, we onlykeep noun compounds and particle verbs consisting of two constituents.
The resulting set consists of93,299 noun compound types and 3,689 particle verb types.3.3 Predicting Compositionality based on Distributional SimilarityStarting from this set of compounds as derived from our parallel training data, we collected distributionalco-occurrence information from two large German web corpora and the machine translation training data:(i) the German COW corpus (Sch?afer and Bildhauer (2012), ?9 billion words), (ii) the SdeWaC (Faa?and Eckart (2013), ?880 million words), (iii) our MT parallel corpus (?40 million words) and (iv) MTlanguage model training data (?146 million words).
We relied on earlier work and used the 20,000 mostfrequent nouns from the SdeWaC as co-occurrence features, looking into a window of 20 words to the leftand to the right of our target compounds and their constituents.
We thus obtained a co-occurrence matrixof all compounds and their constituents with the 20,000 selected nouns.
As co-occurrence strength (i.e.,how strong is a co-occurrence between a target word and a co-occurring noun), we collected frequenciesand transformed them into local mutual information (LMI) values, cf.
Evert (2005).
Finally, we calcu-lated the distributional similarity between the compounds and their constituents, relying on the standardmeasure cosine.
The cosine value is then used to predict the degree of compositionality between therespective compound?constituent pairs.
For example, the cosine value of the pair Baumschule?Baum1is0.38, while the cosine value of the pair Baumschule?Schule is only 0.01.3.4 Semantically-Informed Compound SplittingIn the two preceding sections, we described how we identified component words and calculated distribu-tional compositionality scores for all of the compounds found in our training data.
Here, we give detailson how we include the semantic information into the compound splitting process.
Recall that we onlywant to split compositional compounds and keep non-compositional compounds together.The splitting decision (to split/not split a compound) is based on the compositionality score of thecompound that takes into account either one or both of the compound?constituent cosine values: if thepredicted degree of compositionality is high, the compound is split.
We consider and combine four dif-ferent criteria: i) only the compound?modifier similarity (mod); (ii) only the compound?head similarity(head); a combination of the compound?modifier and the compound?head similarities, relying on (iii) thegeometric mean (geom) or (iv) on the arithmetic mean (arith).
We used different thresholds for each ofthese criteria throughout our experiments, with a specific focus on distinguishing the contributions of themodifiers vs. the heads in the splitting decision, following insights from recent work in psycholinguisticstudies (Gagn?e and Spalding, 2009; Gagn?e and Spalding, 2011) as well as in computational approacheson noun compounding (Reddy et al., 2011; Schulte im Walde et al., 2013).
Furthermore, we comparethe effects of splitting with regard to two types of compounds, noun compounds and particle verbs: Bothtypes are very productive and can generate a potentially infinite number of new forms.4 Experimental SettingThis section gives an overview on the technical details of the SMT system and our data sets.
Compoundsplitting is applied to all source-language data, i.e.
the parallel data used to train the model, as well asthe input for parameter tuning and testing.2Translation Model Moses is a state-of-the-art toolkit for phrase-based SMT systems (Koehn et al.,2007).
We use it with default settings to train a translation model and we do so separately for each of thedifferent compound splittings.
Word alignment is performed using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).
Fea-ture weights are tuned using Batch-Mira (Cherry and Foster, 2012) with ?-safe-hope?
until convergence.Training Data Our parallel training data contains the Europarl corpus (version 4, cf.
Koehn (2005))and also newspaper texts, overall ca.
1.5 million sentences3(roughly 44 million words).
In addition, we1Baum|schule: ?tree|school?
(tree nursery)2Compounds not contained in the parallel data are always split, as they cannot be translated otherwise.3Data from the shared task of the EACL 2009 workshop on statistical machine translation: www.statmt.org/wmt0984use an English corpus of roughly 227 million words (including the English part of the parallel data) tobuild a target-side 5-gram language model with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) in combination with KENLM(Heafield, 2011).
For parameter tuning, we use 1,025 sentences of news data.Standard Test set 1,026 sentences of news data (test set from the 2009 WMT Shared Task): this set isto measure the translation quality on a standard SMT test and make it comparable to other work.Noun/Verb Test set As our main focus lies on sentences containing compounds, we created a secondtest set which is rich in compounds.
From the combined 2008-2013 Shared Task test sets, we extractedall sentences containing at least one noun compound for which we have compound-constituent similarityscores.
Moreover, we excluded sentences containing nouns that are not in the parallel training data: suchcompounds can only be translated when split which allows to translate their components.
The final testset consists of 2,574 sentences.
Similarly, we also created a set rich in particle verbs (855 sentences).Opaque Test set As the two first test sets mainly contain compositional compounds, we use a third testset consisting of sentences with only non-compositional compounds.
The underlying compounds werechosen based on a list containing noun compounds and human ratings for compositionality (von derHeide and Borgwaldt (2009)).
As before, the compounds must have occurred in the parallel data.
Theresult is a list of 14 compounds, of which 11 have a low modifier-compound similarity and 3 have a lowhead-compound similarity.
We then extracted sentences containing these compounds (5 per compound =70 in total) from German newspaper data4.
In contrast to the other sets, we use this test set in a qualitativestudy, to approximate the translation quality by counting the number of correctly translated compounds.5 SMT ResultsIn this section, we present and discuss the results of our machine translation experiments.
We first reportresults for two test sets in terms of a standard evaluation metric (BLEU) and then continue with a small-scale qualitative study on the translational behaviour of non-compositional compounds.5.1 Compound Splitting within a Standard SMT TaskBLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is a common metric to automatically measure the quality of SMT outputby comparing n-gram matches of the SMT output with a human reference translation.
Table 1 lists theresults for our SMT-systems: we report on different compound-constituent scores and thresholds, fornoun compounds and particle verbs respectively.

We compare our systems to thescores of a baseline system (without compound process-ing) and an aggressive split system in which all nouncompounds and particle verbs are split.
The labels DISTand FREQ indicate how several possible splittings weredisambiguated: DIST means we chose the splitting optionhaving the higher geometric mean of the two compound-constituent scores, assuming that the variant expressing ahigher compositionality score leads to the more probablesplitting analysis.
For FREQ, the decision is based on thegeometric mean of corpus frequencies of the respectivecomponents of the compound, as is common practise forthe disambiguation of multiple splitting options in SMT(Koehn and Knight, 2003; Fritzinger and Fraser, 2010).In terms of BLEU, there is little difference for these twovariants.
For further experiments, we thus decided to al-ways use FREQ for disambiguation, assuming that com-ponents chosen by frequency are potentially better repre-4www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/korpora/hgc.html85rating compound gloss mod.

Thus, we first use frequencies to determine the best split option in the caseof several possibilities, and then we apply distributional semantics to determine whether to split at all.The remainder of Table 1 reports on different variants of the semantically-informed splitting criteria weused.
The notation head/mod/geom/arith indicates which (combination of) compound-constituent scoreswere applied as criterion, with the threshold indicated by the vertical number.
We performed the firstset of experiments with different thresholds for noun compounds, and then applied the medium-rangethresholds to the particle verbs.
Generally, there are no considerable differences between the systemswith semantically restricted splitting and the aggressive split systems, even though there seems to be aslightly positive effect for particle verbs.
Having a closer look, we find that for noun compounds on thestandard test set, the best results (threshold: 0.1) are at the same level as the aggressive split systems;with some small losses in BLEU on some of the other settings.5.2 DiscussionAll settings clearly outperform the baseline system (without compound processing).
This indicates thatphrase-based SMT is rather robust with regard to non-semantic splitting as it is can often recover fromover-splitting by translating the word sequence as a phrase.
This is in line with previous observationsof Koehn and Knight (2003).
The results for the noun test set, which is biased towards containing morenominal compounds, even suggests that less splitting might harm the system, as the BLEU scores tendto drop when increasing the threshold.
For particle verbs,5the picture is slightly different: first, splittingonly particle verbs does not lead to a considerable improvement over the baseline, as in the case of nouncompounds.
For the verb test set, it even leads to a drop in BLEU.
However, a more restricted splittingleads to improved BLEU scores, even though not significantly better than the un-split baseline system.Even though the handling of particle verbs needs to be refined in terms of dealing with their structuralbehaviour (split vs. unsplit depending on the sentence structure) or ambiguities of the particle verb,we consider this an encouraging result indicating that particle verbs can benefit from a semantically-informed splitting process.There are several possible reasons why a more restricted splitting might not lead to an improvement,even though the idea of splitting only compositional compounds is intuitive and straightforward.Inconsistent Splitting Compositionality is a continuum rather than a binary decision, with the scores ofmany (compositional) compounds being in the medium range.
Thus, it happens that some compoundscontaining a certain constituent are split, whereas others are not: such inconsistent splittings do notcontribute to the generalization compound splitting aims for.
Table 2 gives examples for compoundswith different degrees of compositionality, which illustrate this issue: for Industriestaat (?industrialnation?)
and Staatskasse (?public purse?)
in the middle part of the table, a splitting decision based onthe head scores for thresholds of 0.15 or 0.2 leads to inconsistent splitting.
Only compounds with highscores, as the examples at the top of Table 2 are always split.
The bottom part gives examples withcomparatively low compound-constituent scores that would benefit from splitting, but which will not besplit in any of our systems.5Note that there are considerably less particle verbs than noun compounds in the standard test set and the parallel data.86compound gloss translation unsplit f split fSeehunde sea|dogs seals seals 5 seals 5Flohmarkt flea|market flea market flea market 5 flea market 5Kopfsalat head|salad lettuce lettuce 5 lettuce 5Handtuch hand|cloth towel towel 5 towel 5Kronleuchter crown|candelabra chandelier chandelier 5 crown leuchter 5G?urteltiere belt|animal armadillo armadillos 5 belt animals 5Wasserhahn water|rooster tapwater tap 2tap 5water supply 3Meerschweinchensea|piglet guinea pigguinea pig 4guinea pig 5sea pig 1Taschenbuch pocket|book paperbackpaper back 3paperback 5pocket book 2Kronkorken crown|cork crown cap *kronkorken 5 crown corks 5Taschenlampe pocket|lamp flashlightpocket lamp 4*taschenlampe 5bag lamp 1Fleischwolf meat|wolf meat grinder *fleischwolf 5 meat wolf 5Marienk?afer Mary|bug ladybug *marienk?afer 5 *marie k?afer 5Blockfl?oten block|flute recorderblock might 4*blockfl?oten 5bloc might 1Table 3: correct vs. wrong ?
Translation of non-compositional compounds (opaque test set) withoutbeing split (unsplit) vs. being split prior to translation.
?*?
highlights untranslated compounds.Coverage of Opaque Compounds Another relevant factor concerns the frequency ranges of compoundsthat are most interesting for this approach.
High/mid frequency compounds are usually well-covered bythe training data of an SMT system, and in most cases they are translated correctly even if they havebeen split erroneously.
This is due to the fact that split compounds can be learned and translated as aphrase if there were enough instances for the system to learn a valid translation.
In the case of low-frequency compounds, the system is less likely to learn a correct translation from the parallel data.However, low-frequency compounds are not well covered by the system and splitting should thus behighly beneficial.
Newly created, i.e.
highly compositional compounds, tend to be of low frequency, asis illustrated by the example of Staatsmonotheismus (freq=1 in the parallel data) in Table 2.
However,a wrong splitting decision for a non-compositional compound of low frequency is likely to lead to anincorrect translation as the SMT system has better statistics for the individual parts than for the sequenceof the compounds constituents.
We assume that for low-frequency compounds the distributional similar-ity scores are generally less reliable, even though using LMI helps to minimize this.
To a certain extent,we expect non-compositional compounds ?which are typically considered as lexicalized?
to occur withhigher frequencies than novel compositional compounds.6Furthermore, there are considerably morecompositional than non-compositional compounds in standard text.
Thus, being in favor of splitting inthe case of low-frequency words should be reasonable in most contexts.6 A Closer Look at Translating Opaque CompoundsIn this section, we compare the translations of non-compositional compounds when they are unsplitand when they are split.
We use a small test set containing 70 sentences, 5 for each of the 14 non-compositional compounds (see Section 4).
Then we conduct a small-scale qualitative analysis focusingon the correct translation of opaque compounds.Table 3 reports on correct translations for the non-compositional compounds for an experiment wherethey have been split or not split (unsplit) prior to translation.
Even though all compounds occurred inthe parallel data, five (which are marked with ?*?)
cannot be translated by the unsplit system due to notbeing aligned correctly.
The other compounds are translated correctly (marked with ?+?
in Table 3).In the course of our study, we found that many of the correct translations remain the same (seals, fleamarket, lettuce, towel).
In the case of guinea pig, paperback and tap there are mixed results of correct andincorrect translations.
Only in the cases of chandelier (?crown leuchter?)
and armadillo (?belt animal?
),6It has to be noted, though, that the model is influenced by the somewhat different domain of the parallel data (EuropeanParliament proceedings, a standard data set for SMT).87compound gloss translation compound gloss translationB?arlauch bear|leek bear leek Handtasche hand|bag handbagBaumschule tree|school tree nursery Hirschk?afer stag|beetle stag beetleL?owenanteil lion|share lion?s share H?uttenk?ase cottage|cheese cottage cheeseFliegenpilz fly|mushroom fly agaric Kronkorken crown|cork crown capFlohmarkt flea|market flea market Teelicht tea|light tea candleTable 4: Examples for (near) literal translation of non-compositional compounds.which were translated correctly with the unsplit system, all translations obtained with the split system arewrong.
Somewhat surprisingly, in some cases there even is a benefit from splitting the non-compositionalcompounds: Kronkorken, previously not translated at all, is correctly generated as crown cork.
For otherpreviously untranslated words, Fleischwolf and Taschenlampe, literal translations of the constituentsare given: while meat wolf (instead of meat grinder) is probably not understandable, the translation ofTaschenlampe as pocket lamp is certainly preferable to the untranslated compound.Due to the observed unexpected translational behaviour of 2 of the 14 non-compositional compounds(Flohmarkt and Kronkorken), which can be translated literally and thus ?in theory?
benefit from splitting,we present a small study illustrating that this phenomenon is not as rare as one would intuitively expect.This study is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to point out that the translational behaviour ofnon-compositional compounds can correspond to that of compositional compounds; Table 4 lists a fewsuch examples.
We assume that this behaviour is due to the fact that English and German are similarlanguages with a similar background.
Thus, the ?images?
used in non-compositional words often tend tobe similar.
For some of the compounds (e.g.
Flohmarkt) this is even true for some Romance languages,too (IT: mercato delle pulci, FR: march?e aux puces) .Generally, the SMT system should even be able to handle cases where the translation of one part isnot strictly literal (e.g.
cap?cork or agaric?mushroom).
In comparison to a dictionary, which only listsfew translations, the translation model offers a large choice of translation options that are not alwaysstrictly synonymous, but can cover a large range of related meanings.
In combination with the target-side language model, this could allow to ?guess?
good translations of such compounds.
However, thecomponent-wise translation of non-compositional compounds only works if the source- and target lan-guage compounds contain the same number of constituents.
For example, consider translating the wordFaultier (lazy|animal: ?sloth?
): even if the SMT system offers the translation faul?sloth, it would alsoneed to produce a translation for the constituent tier, probably resulting in something like sloth animal.In conclusion, while phrase-based SMT is often able to recover from over-splitting by translatinga word sequence as a phrase, this is not always necessary for opaque compounds as they can have aliteral or near-literal translation.
Thus, for explicitly handling non-compositional compounds in SMT, amonolingual estimation of compositionality is not the only relevant factor.
The translational behaviourof compounds should also be taken into account.7 Conclusion and Future WorkWe studied the impact of compositionality in German-English SMT by restricting compound splitting tocompositional compounds.
The decision about compositionality is based on the distributional similaritybetween a compound and its constituents.
We experimented with different threshold/score combinationson a standard and a specifically created test set.
Our results indicate that phrase-based SMT is very robustwith regard to over-splitting non-compositional noun compounds, with the exception of low-frequencycompounds.
Furthermore, we studied the translational behaviour of non-compositional compounds witha special focus on the fact that non-compositional compounds can in some cases be translated component-wise, leading to the conclusion that a monolingual estimation of compositionality is not sufficient for anoptimal explicit handling of compounds in SMT applications.The relatively low impact of distinguishing the degree of compositionality might also be due to the factthat the task of translating noun compounds can be considered ?easy?, as the split components alwaysoccur adjacently.
In contrast, handling other types of non-compositional structures (e.g.
noun-verb orpreposition-noun-verb combinations which are non-compositional) is a challenging task for future work.88AcknowledgementsThis work was funded by the DFG Research Projects ?Distributional Approaches to Semantic Related-ness?
