For noun com-pounds, dictionary-based methods and POS-tagging seem to contribute most to the per-formance of the system whereas for lightverb constructions, the combination of POS-tagging, syntactic information and restrictionson the nominal and verbal component yieldthe best result.
However, focusing on deverbalnouns proves to be beneficial for both typesof MWEs.
The effect of syntax is negligibleon noun compound detection whereas it is un-ambiguously helpful for identifying light verbconstructions.1 IntroductionMultiword expressions are lexical items that can bedecomposed into single words and display idiosyn-cratic features (Sag et al, 2002; Calzolari et al,2002; Kim, 2008).
They are frequent in languageuse and they usually exhibit unique and idiosyn-cratic behavior, thus, they often pose a problem toNLP systems.
A compound is a lexical unit thatconsists of two or more elements that exist on theirown.
Light verb constructions are verb and nouncombinations in which the verb has lost its meaningto some degree and the noun is used in one of itsoriginal senses (e.g.
have a walk or give advice).In this work, we aim at identifying nominal com-pounds and light verb constructions by using rule-based methods.
Noun compounds belong to themost frequent MWE-classes (in the Wikipedia cor-pus we developed for evaluation (see 3.2), about75% of the annotated multiword expressions werenoun compounds) and they are productive, i.e.
newnominal compounds are being formed in languageuse all the time, which yields that they cannot belisted exhaustively in a dictionary (as opposed toe.g.
prepositional compounds).
Their inner syntacticstructure varies: they can contain nouns, adjectivesand prepositions as well.Light verb constructions are semi-productive, thatis, new light verb constructions might enter the lan-guage following some patterns (e.g.
give a Skypecall on the basis of give a call).
On the other hand,they are less frequent in language use (only 9.5% ofmultiword expressions were light verb constructionsin the Wikipedia database) and they are syntacticallyflexible, that is, they can manifest in various forms:the verb can be inflected, the noun can occur in itsplural form and the noun can be modified.
The nom-inal and the verbal component may not even be ad-jacent in e.g.
passive sentences.Our goal being to compare how different ap-proaches perform in the case of the different typesof multiword expressions, we have chosen these twotypes of MWEs that are dissimilar in several aspects.2 Related workThere are several applications developed for identi-fying MWEs, which can be classified according tothe methods they make use of (Piao et al, 2003).First, statistical models rely on word frequencies,co-occurrence data and contextual information indeciding whether a bigram or trigram (or even ann-gram) of words can be labeled as a multiword ex-pression or not.
Such systems are used for several116languages and several types of multiword expres-sions, see e.g.
Bouma (2010).
The advantage ofstatistical systems is that they can be easily adaptedto other languages and other types of multiword ex-pressions, however, they are not able to identify raremultiword expressions (as Piao et al (2003) empha-size, 68% of multiword expressions occur at mosttwice in their corpus).Some hybrid systems make use of both statisti-cal and linguistic information as well, that is, rulesbased on syntactic or semantic regularities are alsoincorporated into the system (Evert and Kermes,2003; Bannard, 2007; Cook et al, 2007; Al-Haj andWintner, 2010).
This results in better coverage ofmultiword expressions.
On the other hand, thesemethods are highly language-dependent because ofthe amount of linguistic rules encoded, thus, it re-quires much effort to adapt them to different lan-guages or even to different types of multiword ex-pressions.
However, the combination of differentmethods may improve the performance of MWE-extracting systems (Pecina, 2010).Several features are used in identifying multi-word expressions, which are applicable to differ-ent types of multiword expressions to various de-grees.
Co-occurrence statistics and POS-tags seemto be useful for all types of multiword expressions,for instance the tool mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al,2010a) makes use of such features, which is illus-trated through the example of identifying Englishcompound nouns (Ramisch et al, 2010b).Caseli et al (2010) developed an alignment-basedmethod for extracting multiword expressions fromparallel corpora.
This method is also applied tothe pediatrics domain (Caseli et al, 2009).
Zarrie?and Kuhn (2009) argue that multiword expressionscan be reliably detected in parallel corpora by usingdependency-parsed, word-aligned sentences.
Sinha(2009) detects Hindi complex predicates (i.e.
a com-bination of a light verb and a noun, a verb or an ad-jective) in a Hindi?English parallel corpus by iden-tifying a mismatch of the Hindi light verb meaningin the aligned English sentence.
Van de Cruys andMoiro?n (2007) describe a semantic-based methodfor identifying verb-preposition-noun combinationsin Dutch, which relies on selectional preferences forboth the noun and the verb.
Cook et al (2007) dif-ferentiate between literal and idiomatic usages ofverb and noun constructions in English.
They makeuse of syntactic fixedness of idioms when develop-ing their unsupervised method.
Bannard (2007) alsoseeks to identify verb and noun constructions in En-glish on the basis of syntactic fixedness.
Samardz?ic?and Merlo (2010) analyze English and German lightverb constructions in parallel corpora.
They foundthat linguistic features (i.e.
the degree of composi-tionality) and the frequency of the construction bothhave an effect on aligning the constructions.3 ExperimentsIn order to identify multiword expressions, simplemethods are worth examining, which can serve as abasis for implementing more complex systems andcan be used as features in machine learning set-tings.
Our aim being to compare the effect of dif-ferent methods on the identification of noun com-pounds and light verb constructions, we consideredit important to develop methods for both MWE typesthat make use of their characteristics and to adaptthose methods to the other type of MWE ?
in thisway, the efficacy and the MWE-(in)dependence ofthe methods can be empirically evaluated, which canlater have impact on developing statistical MWE-detectors.Earlier studies on the detection of light verb con-structions generally take syntactic information as astarting point (Cook et al, 2007; Bannard, 2007;Tan et al, 2006), that is, their goal is to classify verb+ object constructions selected on the basis of syn-tactic pattern as literal or idiomatic.
However, wedo not aim at classifying LVC candidates filtered bysyntactic patterns but at identifying them in runningtext without assuming that syntactic information isnecessarily available.
In our investigations, we willpay distinctive attention to the added value of syn-tactic features on the system?s performance.3.1 Methods for MWE identificationFor identifying noun compounds, we made use of alist constructed from the English Wikipedia.
Lower-case n-grams which occurred as links were collectedfrom Wikipedia articles and the list was automati-cally filtered in order to delete non-English terms,named entities and non-nominal compounds etc.
Inthe case of the method ?Match?, a noun compound117candidate was marked if it occurred in the list.
Thesecond method we applied for noun compounds in-volved the merge of two possible noun compounds:if A B and B C both occurred in the list, A B C wasalso accepted as a noun compound (?Merge?).
Sincethe methodology of dictionary building was not ap-plicable for collecting light verb constructions (i.e.they do not function as links in Wikipedia), we couldnot apply these two methods to them.In the case of ?POS-rules?, a noun compoundcandidate was marked if it occurred in the list andits POS-tag sequence matched one of the previ-ously defined patterns (e.g.
JJ (NN|NNS)).
Forlight verb constructions, the POS-rule method meantthat each n-gram for which the pre-defined patterns(e.g.
VB.?
(NN|NNS)) could be applied was ac-cepted as light verb constructions.
For POS-tagging,we used the Stanford POS Tagger (Toutanova andManning, 2000).
Since the methods to follow relyon morphological information (i.e.
it is requiredto know which element is a noun), matching thePOS-rules is a prerequisite to apply those methodsto identify MWEs.The ?Suffix?
method exploited the fact that manynominal components in light verb constructions arederived from verbs.
Thus, in this case only construc-tions that contained nouns ending in certain deriva-tional suffixes were allowed and for nominal com-pounds the last noun had to have this ending.The ?Most frequent?
(MF) method relied on thefact that the most common verbs function typicallyas light verbs (e.g.
do, make, take, have etc.)
Thus,the 15 most frequent verbs typical of light verb con-structions were collected and constructions wherethe stem of the verbal component was among thoseof the most frequent ones were accepted.
As fornoun compounds, the 15 most frequent nouns in En-glish were similarly collected1 and the lemma of thelast member of the possible compound had to beamong them.The ?Stem?
method pays attention to the stem ofthe noun.
In the case of light verb constructions, thenominal component is typically one that is derivedfrom a verbal stem (make a decision) or coincideswith a verb (have a walk).
In this case, we accepted1as listed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most\_common\_words\_in\_Englishonly candidates that had the nominal component /the last noun whose stem was of verbal nature, i.e.coincided with a stem of a verb.Syntactic information can also be exploited inidentifying MWEs.
Typically, the syntactic relationbetween the verb and the nominal component in alight verb construction is dobj or prep ?
usingStanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003)).
The re-lation between the members of a typical noun com-pound is nn or amod in attributive constructions.The ?Syntax?
method accepts candidates amongwhose members these syntactic relations hold.We also combined the above methods to identifynoun compounds and light verb constructions in ourdatabases (the union of candidates yielded by themethods is denoted by ?
while the intersection isdenoted by ?
in the respective tables).3.2 ResultsFor the evaluation of our models, we developed acorpus of 50 Wikipedia articles, in which severaltypes of multiword expressions (including nomi-nal compounds and light verb constructions) andNamed Entities were marked.
The database contains2929 occurrences of nominal compounds and 368occurrences of light verb constructions and can bedownloaded under the Creative Commons licence athttp://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/rgai/mwe.Table 1 shows the results of our experiments.Methods were evaluated on the token level, i.e.
eachoccurrence of a light verb construction had to beidentified in text.
It can be seen that the best resultfor noun compound identification can be obtainedif the three dictionary-based methods are combined.We also evaluated the method of POS-rules withouttaking into account dictionary matches (POS-rulesw/o dic), which result serves as the baseline for com-paring the effect of LVC-specific methods on nouncompound detection.As can be seen, by adding any of the LVC-specificfeatures, the performance of the system declines, i.e.none of them can beat the baseline.
While the fea-ture ?Stem?
(and its combinations) improve preci-sion, recall severely falls back: especially ?Most fre-quent noun?
(MFN) has an extremely poor effect onit.
This was expected since the lexical constrainton the last part of the compound heavily restrictsthe scope of the noun compounds available.
On the118other hand, the 15 most frequent nouns in Englishare not derived from verbs hence they do not end inany of the pre-defined suffixes, thus, the intersectionof the features ?MFN?
and ?Suffix?
does not yieldany noun compound (the intersection of all the threemethods also behaves similarly).
It must be men-tioned, however, that the union of all features yieldsthe best recall as expected and the best F-measurecan be achieved by the union of ?Suffix?
and ?Stem?.The effect of adding syntactic rules to the systemis not unequivocal.
In many cases, the improvementis marginal (it does not exceed 1% except for thePOS-rules w/o dic method) or the performance evendegrades.
The latter is most obvious in the case ofthe combination of dictionary-based rules, which ismainly caused by the decline in recall, however, pre-cision improves.
The overall decline in F-score maythus be related to possible parsing errors.In the case of light verb constructions, the recallof the baseline (POS-rules) is high, however, its pre-cision is low (i.e.
not all of the candidates definedby the POS patterns are light verb constructions).The ?Most frequent verb?
(MFV) feature proves tobe the most useful: the verbal component of the lightverb construction is lexically much more restrictedthan the noun, which is exploited by this feature.The other two features put some constraints on thenominal component, which is typically of verbal na-ture in light verb constructions: ?Suffix?
simply re-quires the noun to end in a given n-gram (without ex-ploiting further grammatical information) whereas?Stem?
allows nouns derived from verbs.
Whencombining a verbal and a nominal feature, union re-sults in high recall (the combinations typical verb +non-deverbal noun or atypical verb + deverbal nounare also found) while intersection yields high preci-sion (typical verb + deverbal noun combinations arefound only).We also evaluated the performance of the ?Syn-tax?
method without directly exploiting POS-rules.Results are shown in Table 2.
It is revealed thatthe feature dobj is much more effective in identify-ing light verb constructions than the feature prep,on the other hand, dobj itself outperforms POS-rules.
If we combine the dobj feature with thebest LVC-specific feature (namely, MFV), we canachieve an F-measure of 26.46%.
The feature dobjcan achieve a recall of 59.51%, which suggestsMethod P R FDobj 10.39 59.51 17.69Prep 0.46 7.34 0.86Dobj ?

Dobj: verb + object pairs, Prep: verb +prepositional complement pairs, MFV: the verb is amongthe 15 most frequent light verbs.that about 40% of the nominal components in ourdatabase are not objects of the light verb.
Thus, ap-proaches that focus on only verb-object pairs (Cooket al, 2007; Bannard, 2007; Tan et al, 2006) fail toidentify a considerable part of light verb construc-tions found in texts.The added value of syntax was also investigatedfor LVC detection as well.
As the results show, syn-tax clearly helps in identifying LVCs ?
its overalleffect is to add up to 4% to the F-score.
The bestresult, again, is yielded by the MFV method, whichis about 30% above the baseline.4 DiscussionWhen contrasting results achieved for light verbconstructions and noun compounds, it is revealedthat the dictionary-based method applying POS-rules yields the best result for noun compounds andthe MFV feature combined with syntactic informa-tion is the most useful for LVC identification.
Ifno dictionary matches were taken into consideration,the combination of the features ?Suffix?
and ?Stem?achieved the best result, however, ?Stem?
alone canalso perform similarly.
Since ?Stem?
identifies de-verbal nouns, that is, nouns having an argumentstructure, it is not surprising that this feature is valu-able in noun compound detection because the firstpart in the compound is most probably an argumentof the deverbal noun (as in noun compound detectionthe object of detection is noun compound, in otherwords, we detect noun compounds).
Thus, it will beworth examining how the integration of the ?Stem?feature can improve dictionary-based models.Making use of only POS-rules does not seem to119MethodNoun compounds NC + syntax LVC LVC + syntaxP R F P R F P R F P R FMatch 37.7 54.73 44.65 49.64 48.31 48.97 - - - - - -Merge 40.06 57.63 47.26 51.69 47.86 49.70 - - - - - -POS-rules 55.56 49.98 52.62 59.18 46.39 52.02 - - - - - -Combined 59.46 52.48 55.75 62.07 45.81 52.72 - - - - - -POS-rules w/o dic 28.33 66.23 39.69 29.97 64.18 40.87 9.35 72.55 12.86 7.02 76.63 16.56Suffix 27.02 8.91 13.4 28.58 8.84 13.5 9.62 16.3 12.1 11.52 15.22 13.11MF 12.26 1.33 2.4 12.41 1.29 2.34 33.83 55.16 41.94 40.21 51.9 45.31Stem 29.87 37.62 33.3 31.69 36.63 33.99 8.56 50.54 14.64 11.07 47.55 17.96Suffix?MF 0 0 0 - - - 44.05 10.05 16.37 11.42 54.35 18.88Suffix?MF 23.36 10.24 14.24 24.50 10.13 14.34 19.82 61.41 29.97 23.99 57.88 33.92Suffix?Stem 28.4 6.49 10.56 30.03 6.42 10.58 10.35 11.14 11.1 12.28 11.14 11.68Suffix?Stem 29.35 40.05 33.87 31.12 39.06 34.64 8.87 57.61 15.37 11.46 54.35 18.93MF?Stem 9.16 0.41 0.78 9.6 0.41 0.79 39.53 36.96 38.2 46.55 34.78 39.81MF?Stem 29.13 38.55 33.18 31.85 36.04 33.81 10.42 68.75 18.09 13.36 64.67 22.15Suffix?MF?Stem 0 0 0 - - - 47.37 7.34 12.7 50.0 6.79 11.96Suffix?MF?Stem 28.68 40.97 33.74 30.33 39.95 34.48 10.16 72.28 17.82 13.04 68.2 21.89Table 1: Experimental results in terms of precision (P), recall (R) and F-measure (F).

However, themost useful feature for identifying LVCs, namely,MFV/MFN proves to perform poorly for noun com-pounds, which can be explained by the fact that theverbal component of LVCs usually comes from awell-defined set of frequent verbs, thus, it is lexicallymore restricted than the parts of noun compounds.The feature ?Stem?
helps improve recall and this fea-ture can be further enhanced since in some cases,the Porter stemmer did not render the same stem toderivational pairs such as assumption ?
assume.
Forinstance, derivational information encoded in word-net relations might contribute to performance.Concerning syntactic information, it has clearlypositive effects on LVC identification, however, thisinfluence is ambiguous in the case of noun com-pounds.
Since light verb constructions form a syn-tactic phrase and noun compounds behave syntac-tically as one unit (having an internal syntactic hi-erarchy though), this result suggests that for nouncompound detection, POS-tagging provides enoughinformation while for light verb constructions, syn-tactic information is expected to improve the system.5 ConclusionsIn this paper, we aimed at identifying noun com-pounds and light verb constructions in running textswith rule-based methods and compared the effectof several features on detecting those two typesof multiword expressions.
For noun compounds,dictionary-based methods and POS-tagging seemto contribute most to the performance of the sys-tem whereas for light verb constructions, the com-bination of POS-tagging, syntactic information andrestrictions on the nominal and verbal componentyield the best result.
Although the effect of syntaxis negligible on noun compound detection, it is un-ambiguously helpful for identifying light verb con-structions.
Our methods can be improved by extend-ing the set and scope of features and refining POS-and syntactic rules and they can be also adapted toother languages by creating language-specific POS-rules, lists of suffixes and light verb candidates.For higher-level of applications, it is necessary toknow which tokens form one (syntactic or semantic)unit, thus, we believe that our results in detectingnoun compounds and light verb constructions can befruitfully applied in e.g.
information extraction ormachine translation as well.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported in part by the National In-novation Office of the Hungarian government withinthe framework of the project MASZEKER.120ReferencesHassan Al-Haj and Shuly Wintner.
