Applying a Mix Word-Pair Identifier to the Chinese Syllable-to-WordConversion ProblemJia-Lin TsaiTung Nan Institute of Technology, Department of Information ManagementTaipei 222, Taiwan, R.O.C.tsaijl@mail.tnit.edu.twAbstractThis paper describes a mix word-pairmix-WP) identifier to resolve homo-nym/segmentation ambiguities as wellas perform STW conversion effec-tively for Chinese input.
The mix-WPidentifier includes a specific word-pair(SWP) identifier and a common word-pair (CWP) identifier.
It is designed asa supporting processing with Chineseinput systems.
Our experiments showthat by applying the mix-WP identifier,together with the Microsoft inputmethod editor 2003 (MSIME) and anoptimized bigram model (BiGram),the tonal and toneless STW perform-ance of the two input systems can beimproved.1 IntroductionCurrently, the most popular method for Chineseinput is phonetic and pinyin based, because Chi-nese people are taught to write the correspond-ing phonetic and pinyin syllables of eachChinese character and word in primary school.In Chinese, each Chinese character correspondsto at least one syllable; and each Chinese wordcan be a mono-syllabic word, such as ??
(mouse)?, a bi-syllabic word, such as ???
(kangaroo)?, or a multi-syllabic word, such as????
(Mickey mouse).?
Although there aremore than 13,000 distinct Chinese characters (ofwhich 5,400 are commonly used), there are onlyabout 1,300 distinct syllables.
Since the size ofproblem space for syllable-to-word (STW) con-version is much less than that of syllable-to-character (STC) conversion, the most existingChinese input systems (Hsu 1994, Hsu et al1999, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al 2002,MSIME) are addressed on STW conversion.Conventionally, there are two approaches forSTW conversion: (1) the linguistic approachbased on syntax parsing, semantic templatematching and contextual information (Hsu 1994,Fu et al 1996, Hsu et al 1999, Kuo 1995, Tsaiand Hsu 2002); and (2) the statistical approachbased on the n-gram models where n is usually 2or 3 (Lin and Tsai 1987, Gu et al 1991, Fu et al1996, Ho et al 1997, Sproat 1990, Gao et al2002, Lee 2003).
Although the linguistic ap-proach requires considerable effort in designingeffective syntax rules, semantic templates orcontextual information, it is more user-friendlythan the statistical approach on understandingwhy such a system makes a mistake (Hsu 1994,Tsai and Hsu 2002).
On the other hand, the sta-tistical language model (SLM) used in the statis-tical approach requires less effort and has beenwidely adopted in commercial Chinese inputsystems (Gao et al 2002, Lee 2003).According to (Fong and Chung 1994, Tsaiand Hsu 2002), homophone selection and sylla-ble-word segmentation are two critical problemsto the STW conversion in Chinese.
Incorrecthomophone selection and failed syllable-wordsegmentation will directly influence the STWconversion rate.
The goal of this study is to il-lustrate the effectiveness of specific word-pairsand common word-pairs for resolving homo-nym/segmentation ambiguities to perform STWconversion in Chinese.
In this paper, we use to-nal to indicate the syllables with four tones, suchas ?ji4(?)shu4(?)?
and toneless to indicate thesyllables without four tones, such as ?ji(?
)shu(?).
?55The remainder of this paper is arranged asfollows.
In Section 2, we firstly propose themethod for auto-generating the specific word-pairs and the common word-pairs from givenChinese sentences.
Then, we develop a mixword-pair (mix-WP) identifier includes a spe-cific word-pair identifier and a common word-pair identifier.
The mix-WP identifier is basedon pre-collected datasets of specific and com-mon word-pairs.
In Section 3, we present ourSTW experiment results.
Finally, in Section 4,we give our conclusions and suggest some fu-ture research directions.2 Development of Mix-WP IdentifierIn this study, a mix word-pair identifier includesa specific word-pair (SWP) identifier and acommon word-pair (CWP) identifier.
The sys-tem dictionary of the mix-WP identifier is com-prised of the CKIP lexicon (CKIP, 1995) andthose unknown words found automatically fromthe UDN 2001 corpus by a Chinese word auto-confirmation (CWAC) system (Tsai et al 2003).The pinyin syllable-words were translated byphoneme-to-pinyin mappings, such as ?????-to-?ji4.
?2.1 Development of SWP Identifier2.1.1 Auto-Generate SWP Data.The steps of auto-generating specific word-pair(AUTO-SWP) for a given Chinese sentence:Step 1.
Generate the segmentation for the givenChinese sentence with a backward maximummatching (BMM) technique.
As pre (Tsai et al2004), the performance of BMM is better thanthat of forward maximum matching.Step 2.
Extract the BEGIN, END and BOUNDword-pairs from the BMM segmentation ofStep 1 by following processes, respectively:(1) BEGIN word-pair.
When the word numberof segmentation is greater than 1, the first twowords will be comprised as a BEGIN word-pair.
For the segmentation ????(concert)??
(locale) ?
?
(enter) ?
?
(many) ?
?
(audience members),?
the ????-???
willbe generated as a BEGIN word-pair.
(2) END word-pair.
When the word number ofsegmentation is greater than 2, the last twowords will be comprised as an END word-pair.For the segmentation ???
(whole)??(construction)??
(prearrange)??
(end ofyear)??(complete),?
the ???-???
willbe generated as an END word-pair.
(3) BOUND word-pair.
When the word num-ber of segmentation is greater than 2, the firstword and the last word will be comprised as aBOUND word-pair.
For the segmentation ???(price)??(ordinarily)??(maintain)??(stable),?
the ???-???
will be generated asa BOUND word-pair.Step 3.
If the generated SWP was not found inits corresponding datasets, insert the generatedSWP into the BEGIN, END and BOUNDword-pair datasets, respectively.2.1.2 SWP Identifier.In Figure 1, the SWP data is a collection of auto-generated BEGIN, END and BOUND SWPdatasets.
If a SWP identifier only uses one of theBEGIN, END or BOUND SWP dataset, it willnaturally become a BEGIN(BN), END(ED) orBOUND(BD) SWP identifier.
The algorithm ofour SWP identifier is as follows:Specific word-pair(SWP) identifierSWP dataSWP-sentenceinput syllablesSystem dicFig.

A system overview of the SWP identifierStep 1.
Input tonal or toneless syllables.Step 2.
Generate all found BN, ED and BDSWP in the input syllables to be the initialSWP set.
if the initial SWP set, if the foundSWP number of the word-syllable pair of aBN, ED or BD SWP is greater than one in theBN, ED or BD datasets, respectively, the SWPwill be dropped from the initial SWP set.Step 3.
Use the longest syllabic word-pair first(LS-WPF) strategy (Tsai and Hsu.
2002) to se-lect the BN, ED and BD word-pair from theinitial SWP set into the final SWP set.Step 4.
Replace corresponding syllable-wordpair of the input syllables with the word-pairsof the final SWP set to be a SWP-sentence.
Asper our experiment, the performance of thethree SWP identifiers is BD < BN < ED.
Thus,the identifying sequence of our SWP identifieris from BD, BN to ED.Table 1 is a step by step example that illustratesthe four steps of our SWP identifier for the Chi-56nese syllables ?shu3 dou1 shu3 bu4 qing1 (?[count]?[always]???[innumerable])).?
Notethat when we used the Microsoft Input MethodEditor 2003 for Traditional Chinese, a trigram-like input system (MSIME), to convert the samesyllables, the output was ??(belong)?(always)?(mouse)?(not)?(clear).

Generate the word segmentation for thegiven Chinese sentence by BMM technique.Step 2.
Extract all the combinations of word-pairs from the BMM segmentation of Step 1 tobe the initial CWP set.
For the segmentation??/??/??,?
three CWP will be extracted,i.e.
??-??
?, ??-???
and ???-??.
?Step 3.
Select the word-pairs comprised of twomulti-syllabic Chinese words (such as ???
(can not)?)
to be the finial CWP set.
For thefinal CWP set, if the word-pair is not found inthe CWP database, insert it into the CWP da-tabase and set its frequency to 1; otherwise,increase its frequency by 1.
In the above case,the final CWP set includes one word-pair, i.e.???-??.
?2.2.2 CWP IdentifierThe system overview of the CWP identifier issame with that of the SWP identifier as shownin Fig.
1.
The algorithm of our CWP identifieris as follows:Step 1.
Input tonal or toneless syllables.Step 2.
Generate all possible word-pairs com-prised of two multi-syllabic Chinese words forthe input syllables to be the input of Step 3.Step 3.
Select out the word-pairs that match aword-pair in the CWP database to be the ini-tial CWP set, firstly.
Then, from the initialCWP set, select the word-pair with maximumfrequency as the key word-pair.
Finally, findthe co-occurrence word-pairs with the keyword-pair in the training corpus to be the finalCWP set.
If there are two or more word-pairswith the same maximum frequency, one ofthem is randomly selected as the key word-pair.Step 4.
Arrange all word-pairs of the final CWPset into a CWP-sentence.
If no word-pairs canbe identified in the input syllables, a NULLCWP-sentence is produced.If applying the CWP identifier on the syllables?yi1 ge5 wen2 ming2 de5 shuai1 wei2 guo4cheng2(??
[a]??
[civilization]?
[of]??[decay]??
[process]),?
the generated WP-sentence will be ?????

.?
For the same syllables, the MSIME willconvert them into ???[a]??[famous]?[of]??[decay]??[process].?
The detailed analy-sis and demonstration of our CWP identifier canbe found in (Tsai 2005).
Appendix A presents acase of the CWP identified results.3 The STW ExperimentsTo evaluate the STW performance of our mix-WP identifier, the STW accuracy, the identifiedcharacter ratio (ICR) and the STW improvementwere used (Tsai 2005).3.1 Experimental DataTo conduct the STW experiments, firstly, usethe inverse translator of phoneme-to-character(PTC) provided in GOING system to converttesting sentences into their corresponding sylla-bles.
All the error PTC translations of GOINGwere corrected by post human-editing.
We, then,apply our SWP, CWP and mix-WP identifier toconvert the syllable sequence back to words andcalculate its STW accuracy and identified char-acter ratio.
All test sentences are composed of astring of Chinese characters.In following experiments, the training andtesting corpus, closed/open test sets and the col-lection of the testing SWP and CWP data were:57Training corpus: The UDN 2001 corpus wasselected as our training corpus.
It is a collectionof 4,539,624 Chinese sentences extracted from whole2001 articles on the United Daily News Website(UDN) in Taiwan.Testing corpus: The UDN 2002 corpus wasselected as our testing corpus.
It is a collectionof 3,321,504 Chinese sentences that were ex-tracted from whole 2002 articles on (UDN).Closed testing set: 10,000 sentences were ran-domly selected from the UDN 2001 corpus asthe closed testing set.Open testing set: 10,000 sentences were ran-domly selected from the UDN 2002 corpus asthe open testing set.
At this point, we checkedthat the selected open testing sentences were notin the closed testing set as well.Testing SWP data: By applying our AUTO-SWP on the UDN 2001 corpus, we created1,754,055 BN, 1,594,036 ED and 2,502,241 BDspecific word-pairs.Testing CWP data: By applying our AUTO-CWP on the UDN 2001 corpus, we created25,439,679 common word-pairs.In this study, we conducted the STW experimentin a progressive manner.
The experimental re-sults of the SWP, CWP and mix-WP identifiersare described in Sub-sections 3.2, 3.3.and 3.4,respectively.3.2 Experiment of SWP IdentifierThis experiment is to demonstrate the tonal andtoneless STW accuracies by using the SWPidentifier with the testing BN, ED, BD and ALLdatasets, respectively.
Note that the symbolALL stands for a mixed collection of all BN,ED and BD word-pairs generated from theUDN 2001 corpus.Table 2.

Meanwhile, be-tween the closed and open test sets, the differ-ences of tonal and toneless STW accuracies ofthe SWP identifier are 0.5% and 2%, respectively.3.3 Experiment of CWP IdentifierThis experiment is to demonstrate the tonal andtoneless STW accuracies among the identifiedword-pairs by using the CWP identifier with thetesting CWP data.Table 3.
The results of the tonal and toneless STWexperiment for the CWP identifierClosed Open     Average (ICR)Tonal     99.1  98.4          98.8 (61.9)Toneless    94.1  90.9          92.6 (58.6)Table 3 shows the average tonal and tonelessSTW accuracies of the CWP identifier for closedand open test sets are 98.8% and 92.6%, respec-tively.
Meanwhile, between the closed and opentest sets, the differences of tonal and tonelessSTW accuracies of the CWP identifier are 0.7%and 3.2%, respectively.3.4 Experiment of Mix-WP IdentifierThis experiment is to demonstrate the tonal andtoneless STW accuracies among the identifiedword-pairs by using the mix-WP identifier withall testing WP data.
From Tables 2 and 3, theSTW performance of the SWP identifier is bet-ter than that of the CWP identifier.
Therefore,our mix-WP identifier uses the CWP identifierto identify CWP first and the SWP identifier toidentifier SWP last for a given syllables.Table 4.
The results of tonal and toneless STW ex-periments for the mix-WP identifierClosed Open Average (ICR)Tonal     99.2  98.4      98.8 (67.6)Toneless    94.9  91.8      93.5 (64.6)Table 4 shows the average tonal and tonelessSTW accuracies of the mix-WP identifier forclosed and open test sets are 98.8% and 93.5%,respectively.
Meanwhile, between the closedand open test sets, the differences of to-nal/toneless STW accuracies of the mix-WPidentifier are 0.8% and 3.1%, respectively.
Theaverage identified character ratio (ICR) of thetonal and the toneless syllables are 67.6% and64.6%, respectively.
To sum up the results ofTables 2 to 4, we conclude that the mix-WP(SWP and CWP) data can be used to effectivelyconvert Chinese STW on the mix-WP-related58portion (including the SWP-related portion andthe CWP-related portion, respectively).3.5 Commercial IME System and BigramModel with WP IdentifierWe selected Microsoft Input Method Editor2003 for Traditional Chinese (MSIME) as ourexperimental commercial Chinese input system.In addition, an optimized bigram model calledBiGram was developed (Tsai et al 2004).
TheBiGram STW system is a bigram-based modeldeveloping by SRILM (Stolcke 2002) withGood-Turing back-off smoothing (Manning andSchuetze, 1999), as well as forward and back-ward LS-WPF strategies (Chen et al 1986, Tsaiet al 2004).
The training corpus and the systemdictionary of this BiGram system are same withthat of the mix-WP identifier.
In this experi-ment, the STW output of the MSIME with themix-WP identifier, or the BiGram with the mix-WP identifier, was collected by directly replac-ing the identified word-pairs from the corre-sponding STW output of MSIME or BiGram.Table 5.

On the other hand, from Table 6, the to-nal and toneless STW improvements of theBiGram by using the mix-WP identifier are12.8% and 19.6%, respectively.
To sum up theresults of this experiment, we conclude that themix-WP identifier can achieve better WP-portion STW accuracy than that of the MSIMEand BiGram Chinese input systems.4 Conclusion and Future DirectionsIn this paper, we have applied a mix-WP identi-fier to the Chinese STW conversion and ob-tained a high STW accuracy on the identifiedword-pairs with ICR of more than 60%.
All ofthe testing mix-WP data was auto-generated byusing the AUTO-SWP and the AUTO-CWP onthe training corpus.
We are encouraged by thefact that mix-WP knowledge can achieve tonaland toneless STW accuracies of 98.8% and93.5%, respectively, for the mix-WP-relatedportion of the testing syllables.
The mix-WPidentifier can be easily integrated into existingChinese input systems or Chinese languageprocessing of typical speech recognition sys-tems by identifying word-pairs in a post-processing step.
Our experimental results showthat, by applying the mix-WP identifier togetherwith the MSIME and the BiGram input systems,the tonal and toneless STW improvements are29%/23% and 13%/20%, respectively.
To theadaptive approach, we also tried to use theAUTO-SWP and the AUTO-CWP to auto-extract new SWP and CWP from the open testsentences into the mix-WP data, firstly.
Then,we found the overall tonal and toneless STWaccuracies of the MSIME and the BiGram forclosed/open syllables become 96.5%/90% and97.1%/89%, respectively.Currently, our approach is quite basic whenmore than one SWP or CWP occurs in the samesentence.
Although there is room for improve-ment, we believe it would not produce a notice-able effect as far as the STW accuracy isconcerned.
However, this issue will becomeimportant as we apply the mix-WP knowledgeto speech recognition.
According to our compu-tations, the collection of our mix-WP knowl-edge can cover approximately 70% and 60% ofthe characters in the UDN 2001 and 2002 cor-pus, respectively.We will continue to expand our collection ofmix-WP knowledge with Web corpus.
In otherdirections, we will try to improve our WP-basedSTW conversion with other types of WP data,such as NEVF and MWP (Tsai et al 2002 and2004), and statistical language models, such asHMM, and extend it to other areas of NLP, es-pecially word segmentation and the mix-WPidentifier from the word lattice of Chinesespeech recognition systems.59ReferencesChung, K.H.
