AbstractAn overview is provided of six information visualization systems designed specifically for gaining an overview of electronic health re-cords (EHR).
The systems discussed all make use of timelines: Lifelines, Lifelines2, KNAVE II, CLEF Visual Navigator, Time-line, and AsbruView.
With the exception of Lifelines2, the main user groups targeted are physicians involved in direct patient care.
Lit-tle attention has been paid towards supporting true secondary use of EHR contents, for ac-tivities such as assessing quality of care, pa-tient health and safety monitoring, and clinical trial recruitment.
Future work on such systems needs to address the complexity of EHR data, missing and incomplete information, and dif-ficulties in displaying data with differing lev-els of granularity.1 Introduction This paper provides an overview of several infor-mation visualization (infovis) systems that have been built for exploring abstracted information from Electronic Health Records (EHR).
EHRs are systems that are used to document care of patients.
The records can include a wide range of data and information, including medications prescribed and administered, immunization history, laboratory test results, allergies, radiology images, treatment plans, and care notes.
Currently, most EHR sys-tems implemented are proprietary and highly cus-tomized when used by larger care institutions.
It is usually the case that only clinicians and other healthcare professionals with direct responsibility for providing care have access to patient data.
The suggestion of secondary use of health data is not new and has been handled separately from the is-sue of creating user interfaces and visualizations.
Safran et al discuss the purpose of clinical data repositories in their white paper and point towards the goal of a national framework for the secondary use of health data in the U.S. (Safran et al, 2007).
According to their definition, secondary use in-cludes activities such as analysis, research, quality and safety measurement, public health, payment, provider certification and accreditation, marketing, and general business applications, while at the same time taking into account the ethical, political, technical and social implications of such re-use.
De Lusignan and van Weel highlight the challenges of making use of clinical data for research, stating, "The available research methods for working with large data sets are limited; it is difficult to infer meaning from data; there is a rapid pace of change in both medicine and technology; and integrating data without reliable unique identifiers is difficult."
(de Lusignan and van Weel, 2006).
Prokosch and Ganslandt have recently summarized the latest ad-vances in enabling clinical data re-use for research purposes (Prokosch and Ganslandt, 2009).
They identify as key challenges the establishment of comprehensive clinical data repositories, the estab-lishment of professional IT infrastructure to sup-76port clinical data capture, and the integration of medical record systems and clinical trial databases.
As discussed in these articles, aggregated, ab-stracted and manipulable information is underutil-ized and hard to come by.
The emerging field of Visual Analytics (Keim, 2008) is relevant to this review.
This field is focus-ing on combining related research areas such as visualization, data mining and statistics to handle large and heterogeneous volumes of data, such as EHR.
The systems we encountered are integrating human judgment with automated analysis, suggest-ing that future work will be related to handling massive amounts of data that contains missing ele-ments - including the results of textual analysis of records content.
1.1 Purpose Our motivation for creating this overview is to compare and discuss some of the available infor-mation visualization/visual analytics tools and how are these used for secondary, i.e.
for purposes other than direct patient care.
This is a first step to-wards infrastructure and coordinating efforts to produce systems that are based on standard input formats, and meet the needs of specifically defined users.
The reader of this overview is most likely working on information extraction, temporal ab-straction, and summarizing EHRs.

1.2 ScopeThe review is non-systematic.
We didn't expect to find large numbers of articles, since this is a rela-tively narrow area of interest.
The search was con-fined to user interfaces and visualizations for EHR data, we searched pubmed, ACM digital library, IEEE library, and Google Scholar, using basic keywords and checked references in found articles.
We also looked for papers on work we had read or known about previously from conferences or other sources.
The literature search covered articles in English only.
Keywords used are listed in Table 1.
2 Systems In this section, we give an overview of the state-of-the-art systems related to visualization of temporal information in EHRs.
Our intention is to cover broad areas of application including representation of medical histories, visual data query and aggre-gation, generation of temporal abstractions and visualization of treatment plans.
Due to the limita-tions in space, we focus only on the most represen-tative systems, which feature interesting and potentially reusable visualization techniques.
Lifelines  LifeLines uses a timeline visualization technique to represent personal histories, medical records and other types on biographical data (Plaisant et al, 1996).
In LifeLines, horizontal bars are used to depict temporal duration and location of events on a horizontal time axis.
Similar events are organized into facets, which can be expanded and collapsed to provide increasing or decreasing level of detail.
Color notations and line thickness are used to indi-cate the importance and relationship of events.
To handle regions with high data density, LifeLines provides zooming functionality allowing users to compress and stretch the time scale at any location.
Additional content (e.g., multimedia) can be added in a linked fashion.
Authors apply LifeLines in the analysis of complex patient medical records to visualize temporal relationships between treat-ments, consultations, disorders, prescriptions, hos-pitalizations and other events.
Lifelines2 LifeLines2 (Wang et al, 2008) is an extension of LifeLines, allowing the user to analyze records from multiple patients at a time.
The system facili-tates comparative visualization of records by77means of aligning, filtering and sorting operations.
By aligning patient records on some common ref-erence event (e.g., the first heart attack), users can easily spot co-occurring and neighboring events.
Ranking and filtering operations complement alignment by interactively reordering or narrowing the set of records to suit a user?s changing focus.
The system proved to be particularly suitable for observational research, where researchers analyze data from different studies in order to better under-stand health problems or study the effect of treat-ments, and in finding patients for clinical trials.
Evaluation studies showed that the system signifi-cantly simplifies typical analytical tasks and that medical specialists can quickly learn the interface.
LifeLines2 is currently used to display EHR data provided by the Informatics for Integrating Biol-ogy & the Bedside (i2b2) Project (Murphy et al, 2006).
While in LifeLines2 the main focus is on visualiz-ing temporal ordering of events, Wang et al em-phasizes practical need in viewing multiple records as an aggregate in order to study frequency of event data over time (Wang et al, 2009).
For in-stance, a user might be interested to analyze blood pressure of all patients who have had an open-heart surgery within 3 months of their first heart attack.
As a solution, authors complement LifeLines2 framework with a new visualization technique, called temporal summaries, which represents dis-tributional trends of events over a set of records in a histogram-like chart.
Furthermore, the system allows splitting the whole dataset of records into multiple subsets and use temporal summaries to compare event patterns between these groups.Figure 1.
The Lifelines2 main window, with focus on timelines.
CLEF  Hallet (Hallett, 2008) proposes a visualization ar-chitecture for browsing medical histories, which integrates visual navigation tools and automatically generated textual summaries.
While the graphical interface facilitates interactive navigation, textual descriptions can, in addition, convey complex tem-poral information and display details that would otherwise be too complex for visualization compo-nents.
Within the system, the patient?s medical his-tory is represented as a network of semantically and temporally organized events, which serves as an input for visualization and natural language generation components.
The visual navigator de-picts a high level overview of a patient?s medical history by plotting events along three parallel time-lines, corresponding to diagnoses, treatments and investigations.
In addition to zooming time scale and detail-on-demand functionality, the navigator provides interactive visualization of semantical relationships between events (e.g., caused-by, has-locus, indicated-by, etc.).
Having different features from the LifeLines interface, the navigator also allows the user to visualize numerical data (e.g., results of blood tests) by plotting results of meas-urements on separate line charts.
Natural language generation is used for two purposes: 1) to create customized textual reports for printing or exchange purposes and 2) as a support tool for the visual navigator, to enable better description of complex events and relationships between them.
KNAVE-II KNAVE-II (Goren-Bar et al, 2004) is an interface enabling knowledge-based visualization and inter-active exploration of time-oriented data at different levels of temporal abstractions (e.g., abstraction of periods of bone marrow toxicity from raw individ-ual hematological data).
Users can navigate through the links of a semantic network while si-multaneously navigating visually through multiple degrees of temporal abstraction of the dataset un-der observation.
The evaluation results have shown that users of KNAVE-II were able to perform que-ries both faster and more accurately than with other standard tools.78Figure 2.
The Knave-II system.
TimeLine The TimeLine system (Bui et al, 2007) is a prob-lem-centric temporal visualization of patient re-cords.
The contents of the EHR are integrated, reorganized, and displayed within the user inter-face (UI) along a timeline.
It is similar to Lifelines in the way that the different elements of the EHR are grouped along the y-axis: imaging, reports, lab tests, etc are collapsible categories.
However, un-like Lifelines, the TimeLine system uses an XML data representation to handle data from distributed, heterogeneous medical databases.
Data elements that are displayed in the UI are classified based on a knowledge base that guides both data inclusion rules and the visualization metaphors used to ren-der the data.Figure 3.
TimeLine system.
ASBRUVIEW AsbruView (Kosara and Miksch, 2001) is a visu-alization and user interface on top of Asbru lan-guage (Shahar et al, 1996) designed to representtreatment procedures as structured time-oriented plans.
AsbruView represents hierarchical and tem-poral relationships between treatment plans using a 3D visualization perspective.
Plans are aligned along the time axis and can be stacked on top of each other and laid out in different ways.
To sim-plify the interface, all graphic elements are repre-sented by well-known real world objects (e.g., track, traffic light, etc.).
Also a 2D view is avail-able which focuses on temporal aspects of plans in greater detail.
To depict uncertainty of future events, AsbruView extends the timeline by using time annotation glyphs (Chuah, 1997).
3 Comparisons  Infovis techniques are a way of augmenting human cognitive capabilities, to help humans find patterns in large volumes of data.
The systems described above target specific user types that will benefit from the visualization methods.
While some user interfaces were developed in close dialog with medical practitioners, like Lifelines2 and Knave-II, others, such as the first Lifelines, Clef and Asbru-view have had only minimal input from their in-tended audience.
3.1 Users, Goals and Tasks Most of the tools were directed at clinicians and clinical practice, although they were not always developed in close relation to them.
Table 2 gives an overview of intended users for each of the named systems, and their proposed goals/tasks.
From the user point of view, a number of tasks and goals can be defined for each tool.
Some are very specific and tend to care for niche usages, while others provide more general visualization methods that can be applied to a number of situations.
System Users, Goals, Tasks Lifelines Clinician  Patient care  Use EHR content in temporal time-based view Lifelines2 Clinical researchers  Research  Compare patterns of events, detecting trends CLEF Clinician, Biomedical researcher  Patient care  Visualize timelines, use NLP to extract com-plex temporal data, aggregate numerical data KNAVE-II Clinician79Patient care  Generation and exploration of context sensitive abstractions of temporal data TimeLine Clinician  Patient care  Use EHR content in temporal time-based view, with additional filters on data based on NLP techniques AsbruView Clinician  Patient care  Medical therapy planning and execution Table 2.
Users, Goals, Tasks.
These systems were designed with input from only a few medical personnel involved in the project.
In general, articles we read concerning these systems that have a more guided development process, i.e.
closely related with physicians, have more specific goals and tasks, because they were designed with these in mind.
Visualizing data for decision-making and analyzing treatment outcome is often a general goal in many of the tools developed in in-teraction with medical staff (Aigner and Miksch, 2006; Mamykina et al, 2004; Portet, 2009).
There is an emphasis on pre-processed patient data, spe-cifically numeric, such as lab tests, heart rate, and blood pressure.
Systems mainly try to help physi-cians answer questions about correlations in the patient's data, and provide a means for supporting quick decision-making making when combining several types of highly heterogeneous data.
Physi-cians can follow a specific treatment plan and check the patient's physiological variables over time.
This also enables the practitioner to check the influence of certain variables in the treatment process and change the protocol if needed.
CLEF, for example, allows the physician to discover events during specific time spans, such as search-ing for past specific liver problems.
Lifelines2 is specifically geared towards research uses and to-wards answering complex queries.
In Lifelines2, a case study involved verifying the results of a clini-cal study with real-life EHR data to see if clinical care data differ from the study results.
The systems we discuss have conducted evaluation studies as a part of the end-stages of development.
The Lifelines evaluations were conducted in an-other domain (use of pattern searching related to monitoring graduate student progress), with limited interviews and input from experts in the medical domain.
The KNAVE system conducted a cross-over study with doctors, comparing KVAVE with existing tools.
TimeLine was evaluated following the development of the interface by five radiolo-gists- focusing on questions related to data integra-tion and the temporal display.
Asbruview was evaluated using questionnaires sent to clinicians.
3.2 Visualization Methods The focus of this paper is on temporal visualization methods since this has been the primary visualiza-tion type studied for aiding humans in organizing and exploring patterns in abstracted EHR content.
All the systems that are compared in this paper display some type of timeline with time running from the left part the screen to the right, time being on the x-axis, and categories of events along the y-axis.
Various techniques for graphically represent-ing specific events are used (e.g.
icons, shapes), AsbruView makes use of 3D, while all the others are flat 2D.
Infovis has been the keyword used to describe these systems, with the idea of presenting a method for human users (most often stated as being clini-cians), to recognize patterns and thereby "amplify cognition" (Chittaro, 2006).
Other methods for recognizing patterns in EHR for secondary use are purely automated and conducted through data min-ing techniques.
Bertini and Lalanne (2009) wrote about the complementary role of automatic data analysis and visualization in knowledge discovery.
They discuss "visual analytics", an outgrowth of infovis that can be seen as an integrated approach combining visualization, human factors, and data analysis.
They suggest 4 categories for classifying approaches: Pure Visualization (VIS), Computa-tionally-enhanced Visualization (V++), Visually enhanced Mining (M++), and Integrated Visualiza-tion and Mining (VM).
In the systems we have compared, there is a spectrum of ideas about how to visualize EHR contents, including movements towards "enhanced" or "intelligence" in the proc-essing of the underlying EHR data.
In Lifelines2, the data visualized was obtained from anonymized EHRs though cooperation with the i2b2 Project (Murphy et al, 2006) The input form of the data is a simple 3-column table containing "ID", "Event Type", and "Time".
Each ID can have multiple events happening at various times.
Lifelines2 al-lows sorting of the data so that records with the80most incidents of one type of event are shown at the top of the screen.
This type of infovis relies on human pattern recognition only and would be con-sidered as "VIS" by Bertini and Lalanne (2009).
In the CLEF project, the CLEF Chronicle, which un-derlies the visualizations, is a semantic network modeling of what happened to the patient, why, and how.
Semantic relations are: causality, reason, finding, and consequence.
The types of events modeled are: problem, investigation, and treat-ment.
The CLEF Visual Navigator might be con-sidered as "V++", computationally enhanced visualization because some sort of automated com-putation supports the visualization.
In CLEF, the visual display is "enhanced with visual techniques for highlighting relationships between events on the timeline."
None of the systems so far that we have seen, would qualify as "visually enhanced mining" or "integrated visualization and mining."
Table 3 provides a full overview for all systems reviewed.

Visual Analytics of Systems using Bertini and Lalanne?s (2009) classification.
The papers we have read that cover EHR visualiza-tion, as seen in the systems presented, express the complexity of abstracted EHR data.
Missing and inconsistent data, dealing with hierarchical data, and problems with granularity are all concerns that become readily apparent through attempting tobuild infovis systems.
Wang (2008) summed it up best "Clinical data tend to be messy with aspects that become only obvious when the data is visual-ized.
The same heart attack might be recorded three times in three days (by the emergency room physician, a cardiologist, and a clerk from the bill-ing office) and it can be hard to differentiate it from 3 separate events.
Even if medical event in-formation is carefully recorded at the time of the doctor visit or during a hospitalization, the time stamp is usually inaccurate by nature."
Future work on visualizations needs to adequately address the complexity of the data rather than work with test data that is too simplistic.
3.3 Text Mining Tasks All mentioned systems, except the CLEF and TimeLine, operate with readily available lists of type- and time-tagged events.
However, clinical records are often stored in textual form what makes them inaccessible for machine processing.
Text mining techniques need to be applied to automati-cally transform textual data into structured, nor-malized form.
Key tasks involve event extraction, classification and normalization.
The CLEF system uses an advanced information extraction engine to identify pre-defined classes of entities (e.g.
diseases, investigations, problems, drugs, etc.)
and semantic relationships between them (e.g.
investigation indicates problem) in natu-ral language texts.
The information extraction process involves lexical and terminological analy-sis, syntactic and semantic analysis, and discourse analysis.
To address the complexity of medical language, the system makes use of language re-sources including the Unified Medical Language System and the Gene Ontology.
Extracted informa-tion is stored in templates, which can be queued or used to generate textual summaries.
The TimeLine system makes use of both textual contents of the EHR as well as numerical data and codes.
An NLP-based system is used in conjunction with the TimeLine UI, for example, performing section analysis in radiology reports to determine whether specific subsections exist within the reports that are related to certain medical problems (Bui et al 2007).814 Conclusions The infovis systems analyzed allow secondary use of EHR content data especially aimed at clinicians documenting patient care.
All of them are focused on visualizing temporal data in a timeline, while displaying specific events from the patient data.
Although directed at medical practitioners in their daily patient care routine, they were not always developed with user feedback.
Evaluation of the different tools was often based on situations out-side of the clinical setting, and might not reflect reality.
A more intimate dialog with clinicians would benefit the creation of targeted systems ad-dressing specific needs of the medical community.
The overall goal of these tools is to present users temporal information contained in a record, im-proving their ability to recognize patterns for knowledge discovery and following treatment.
They introduce simple visualization tools, but some include automated computational enhance-ments supporting it.
EHR contain missing and inconsistent data, which is in general messy.
Due to the complexity of the underlying data, future work needs to address these intricacies rather than using simplistic approaches.
