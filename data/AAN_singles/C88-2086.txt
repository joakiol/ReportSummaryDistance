*Department of Computer ScienceMiddlesex CollegeUniversity of Western OntarioLondon, Ontario, CanadaN6A 5B7Abstract/S0aanes 1979/provides some counterexamples to the theory of nat-ural language presuppositions that is presented in /Gazdar 1979/./Soames 1982/ provides a theory which explains these eounterex-amples.
/Mercer 1987/ rejects the solution found in/Soames 1982/leaving these ounterexamples unexplained.
By reappraising these in-sightful counterexamples, theinferential theory for natural languagepresuppositions described in/Mercer 1987, 1988/gives a simple andstraightforward explanation for the presupposiitional nature of thesesentences.1 Introduction/Soames 1979/ provides ome intriguing counterexamples to themethod for deriving natural anguage presuppositions presented in/Gazdar 1979/.
A proposed modification to Gazdar~s method(/Landman 1981/) which attempts to solve the problem exhibitedby these couuterexamples by introducing extra clausal implieatures"has been effectively argued against in/Soames 1982/.Motivated by the lack of explanation for these reasonably simplecounterexamples, /Soames 1982/ constructs a mechanism that de-rives presuppositions that is a superset of the approaches suggestedby/Gazdax 1979/and/Karttunen and Peters 1979/.
/Mercer 1987/contains methodological nd empirical arguments against Soames'approach to the derivation of natural language presuppositions.This paper presents a reappraisal of some of the insightful coun-terexamples to Gazdar's method given in /Soames 1982/.
Givenan appropriate r presentation f the sentences in question~ the de-fault logic approach to natural language presuppositions described in/Mercer 1987, 1988/gives a simple and straightforward explanationfor the presuppositional ture of these sentences.2 General BackgroundThere has been a long history of attempts to define methods thatwould produce the presuppositions of a sentence.
The default logicapproach that is highlighted here follows the general framework setout in /Gazdar 1979/.
One feature of this framework is that thespeaker isgoverned by Grice's Principle of Cooperative Conversation.Assuming these general guidelines allows a competence model of thehearer's interpretation to generate he appropriate presuppositions ofsentences with the forms 'a or b' and ' i f  a then b'.
Details of thisprocess is given later.2.1 Linguist ic P resuppos i t ionsBeing implied by a natural anguage sentence and the natural (orpreferred) interpretation f its simple negation is the primary qual-ity that qualifies an inference as a presupposition.
This evaluation*This ~esearch was partially supported byNSERC grants A7642 (to It.
Reiter)and A3039 (to P. C. Gilmore).420of inferences i called the negation test.
Presuppositions are gener-ated from lexical and syntactic ontexts.
Those contexts which passthe negation test can be termed presuppositional environments.
Sen-tences (1)-(2) demonstrate some prototypical examples of presuppo-sitions produced by the presuppositional enviromnents, factive verbsand definitions of words.
In each of these xamples tim truth of theaffirmative a-sentence always implies the truth of the c-sentence, andthe truth of the negative b-sentence normally implies the truth of thec-sentence.

These include/Karttunen 1973,1974/~ /Karttuuen and Peters 1975~ \]979/~ /Gazdar 1979/, and/Soames 1979~ 1982/.
The details of these theories are not important.What is of importance is the linguistic basis for these theories.Crucial to any theory, of natural anguage presuppositions is theconcept of a presuppositional environment.
These lexical or syntacticenviromnents generate inferences, which are called presuppositions,whether they are in the scope of a negation or not.
In addition totl~e concept of presuppositional environments~ what is common to allthe linguistic theories i the notion of a projection rule which projectsthe generated inferences as presuppositions of the sentence.
The naiveprojection rule proposed in /Langendoen and Savin 1971/takes allthe presuppositions from all the presuppositional environments con-rained in the sentence and projects them as presuppositions of thesentence.Although the modifications to this simplistic rule differ (see/Kart-tunes 1973, 1974/, /Karttunen and Peters 1975, 1979/, /Gaz-dar 1979/, and \]Soames 1979, 1982/), a common theme is that pre-suppositions are connected with surface phenomena.
Although themethods differ in the importance that the semantic representationplays in the derivation of the presuppositions, without exception thepotential presuppositions that are candidates for the (modified) pro-jection rule are generated because the presuppositional environmentexists in the surface form of the sentence;2.3 A Default  Logic ApproachThe approach presented in /Mercer and Reiter 1982/ and /Mer-cer 1987~ 1988/has anumber of distinguishing features.1.
The method is based on inferencing in a logical system, althoughthe logic is not a classical one.2.
The me~hod uses semantic representations of the naturM la.n-guage sentence.
Iu the case of 'if a then b' the semantic repre-sentation that is nsed directly is a derived representation (a D bcan be derived from a > b, where > is StalnM?er's connective for3.
All presuppositional environments that generate presuppositionsmust be within the scope of a negatiou eil:lter in the represen..taUon el' the sentence or some logical for:m derived from tlfisrepresentation.ilow the method interact:~ with sentential adverbs is the maintheme of this paper.
The definition of presupposition a d the workingof the inference procedure in /Mercer 1987, 198'8/ solves the seepingproblenrs caused by the interaction of negation and other environ-ments.
In the discussion of sententiM adverbs it will be shown thatthe normal ~mntence-seope for negation is circunwented in certaincircamst;utc(:s. This circumvention of the normal rule explains thepresuppositi, utal behaviour of the sentential adverb environment.2.3.1 Log.eal tEepresentatlon fPre.quppoMtions rising DefaultR.ulosA no,'mal default ~*ule is a rule of inference denotedfl(Y)where a(Y) mM fl(x') are a.1\] first order formulae whose fl'ee variablesare among those of .~ = x l , .

A ~lormal default heoryis a set of l\[rst order lbrnrulae together with a set of normal de-faults.
A fized point of a normal default theory is the deductiveclosure of tire set eomprised of the first order fornrulac and somemaximal set of eonsequents that are consistent with the fixed point.The CONSIs'QUENTS'{D} is the set of all conseqaents of the defaultrules in the default thnory.For the purposes of this paper, I will change slightly the interpre-tation of the default rule to mean: if the speM?er says 'a(~')' andfl(Y) is consistent with the heater's knowledge base, KBH, then thehearer can conjecture fl(,~;).
it is not M)solutely clear what the verbsays means (u' how it should be represented.
For the purposes of this1raper I only require those notions first presented in/Grice 1975/un-der the title Principle of Cooperative Conversation and formMized in/Gazdm" 1.979/.
Under Ga:zdar's interpretation f Grice's maxims thespeaker is e(,mmitted to the truth of u, the sentence that he utters.Therefore the speaker knows u.
The conversational approach that Itake views the contrihntion of a speaker's ntterance u as the additionof Ksu to 1(t111 along with other conversational intbrmation wldchis detailed in section 2.3.2.
The meaning of the utterance is then afunction of the inierencing process on I~Bl-1 U {I<su }.The default rules require some extra informa*:ion to guard againstmisuse of the default rules.
This information is a conjunct in theprerequisite of the default rule.
Except for this technical aspect hisextra intbrmation plays no role.
Since it creates long default rules,i have tell it out of all the examples.
For further details see/Mer-cer /.987/.Whenever the discussion concerns the default logic approach, I willassnme that the speaker's utterance has undergone the first phase ofthe interpretation process which generates a semantic representation(logical form) of the sentence uttered.
This ,;entantic representationThe verb believe sholdd be t~kea to lm?&lt first order dctiw~ble or conjecturedfrom the default heory.will be a well-formed sentence in a first order $4 modal languagecontaining a countably intinite set of predicate syntbols, constantsymbols, and variable symbols, plus the logical symbols A, V, D, - ,Ks, ~nd Ps.
The last two symbols, called modal operators, are tobe interpreted as 'the speaker knows that' and 'for all the speakerknows, it is possible that', respectively.
Although there is no generalmethod known to generate this representation, some generM rules(:an be followed.
Any sentence with an explicit negation is translatedinto the widely seeped negation of its affirmative counterpart.
Anycompound sentence is mapped clause by clause into a logical form,each clause being treated as a sentence.2.3 .2  Der iv ing  Presuppos i t ions  inComplex SentencesThe concept discussed herein - -  using default logic to derive presup-positions - -  is strongly influenced by Gazdar's method.
I will presentthe representation f presuppositions in following sections with lit-tle explanation.
For a complete discussion of how presul)postionsare represented by default rules in a default theory together withhow default logic proof theory captures Gazdar's idea of presupposi-tions being consistent with a context see/Mercer and Reiter 1982/or/Mercer 1987/.
Another influence is the use of clausal implicatnres inconnection with deriving presuppositions fl'om complex sentences, tuthe default logic approach the clausal implicatures are used to controlthe division of the original theory into its first order cases.The clausal implicatures are derived fi'om the natural languagesentence according to Gaz, dar's formal treatment of Grice's conversstional principles (/Griee 1975/).
The sentence uttered by a speakercommits the speaker not only to the truth of the sentelme but alsoto the possibility of its clauses (its parts).
So in tlm case of thespeaker uttering 'A or B' or 'if A then B', unless tlmre is backgroundknowledge or there are linguistic reasons to prevent it, the speaker b;committed to PsA, Ps-,A, PsB, aud Ps,'~B.
These implicatures willprovide the means to restrict he division of the theory representingthe utterance into its cases.Becmtse default logic proof theory does )tot display any analogueto the law of the excluded middle (the antecedents of tim default:rules nrust be provable and there is no equivalent to the deductiontheorem) and because presuppositions do arise from the clauses ofcomplex sentences, ome form of analysis by eases is required.
Sincea statement is provable in a case anMysis only if it is provable in allcases, the choice of cases is critical.
As in the case of a tirst ordertheory, too few cases would allow inappropriate statenmuts o Ireproved.
In addition because of the non-monotonic nature of defaultlogic, having too many casts could prevent al)propriate statementsbeing proved.In general the choice of cases must reflect two principles.
Sincethe case analysis is a proof theoretic analogue of the model theoreticlaw of the excluded middle, each ease must completely determinethe truth values of each of the disjunets found in the statement towhich case analysis is being applied.
Also, since the case analysis isjustified solely on linguistic grounds (see /Mercer 1987/ for furtherdiscussion), the cases must reflect this linguistic situation.

case, the possibility of the statement that distinguishes the casemust 1re provable t?om the original default theory.
Since none of themodM statements ake part in the proofs, they are left out of thecases.
An example should clarify these ideas.ExampleSuppose the sentence 'A or B' is uttered.

Note thatalthough PsA, Ps'~A, PsB, Ps'~B are all derivable, none ofA, -~A, B, -~B are candidates for distinguishing a case be-cause, individually, none of them completely determine thetruth values of both A and B.Ilence the two cases of the original theory, T, areTc~s~x = {A A "nB,al .

Firstly, presuppositions are generated from positive andnegative presuppositional environments, if these environments occurin the surface sentence.
Secondly, a number of different methods,collectively called projection methods, are used to screen out thosepotential presuppositions which are not to be projected.
A briefdescription of Soames' method is given in section 4.1.The default logic theory described in detail in/Mercer 1987, 1988/approaches the problem of presupposition-generation from the level oflogical representation.
Presuppositions are generated from the logicalrepresentation if negated presuppositional environments occur in thelogical representation f the natural anguage sentence or some logi-cal form which can be derived from this representation.
Malay of theresults that the modified projection methods achieve are just prooftheoretic results in the default logic approach to natural anguage~For purposes of this definition, the only defaults in each Auco,o i a~e thepresupposition generating defaults.
In reality the default heory would containmany other kinds of defaults.
The definition would have to be changed so thatthe proof of c~, requires the invocation of a presupposition generating default,and that a E Th(CONSEQUENTS{D'}), where D' is the set of presuppositiongenerating defaults~All of the examples presented in this paper deal with default theories havingsingle extensions.
In those theories which have multiple xtensions, some wayof stating that a presupposition s in all extensions is required.
Since xtensionsof normal default heories are orthogonal, if An has multiple xtensions thenthere exists a sentence fl such that Au I-A fl and Au V-a ~/?.
I will call thissituation being split along the fl-dimensiom If the extensions donot split alongthe ~-dimension then either ~ is in all extensions or a is in no extension.
So ifAu f-a ~ (which means that at least one extension contains ~) and Au V/a ~a(which means that no extension contains ~a, which means that the extensions donot split on the a-dimension) then ~ is in all extensions.422presuppositions.
In addition, once the logical representation f sen-tential adverbs is presented, it will be shown that the solution to theproblem of presuppositions derived from sentential adverbs is againobtained in the default logic approach without any modifications.3 Sentential  AdverbsThe two sentential dverbs that will be presented are those found inthe examples given in/Soames 1982/: 'too' and 'again'.
Becanse oneof the defining properties of a presuppositional environment is indiocaring positive to the negation test 4, I will first look at each whenthere is a negation present.
The interesting property displayed by sen-tential adverbs is that in addition to any interaction between egationand the underlying form, there is also an interaction between ega-tion and the adverb.
This interaction can be captured in two differentlogical representations.The sentential dverbs have the added complication that they cantake any part of the sentence as their focus of the adverb.
The focusof the adverb will be capitalized.
Although the verb of the sentencecan be focussed, a presentation f this particular focus would requirean event-based representation.
I do not discuss this focus in thefollowing.
However, it, too, would behave analogously.3.1 TooThe representations of 'kick too' are shown in (3) and (4).
Thesetwo representations convey the different foci of the adverb, 'too', thesubject and the object of 'kick', respectively.
I will be only interestedin the representation which focuses on the subject, that is (3).
Theexplanation for presuppositions that arise from the adverb focussingon the object is similar to the discussion presented below.
(3) ~/xVy.KICK-SUBJ-TOO(x, y) =-K ICK(x ,  y) ^  ~z .K fCK(z ,  y) A x # z(4) VxVy.KICK-OBJ-TOO(x,y) =-KICE(x ,  y) ^  3~.ICICK(~, ~) ^  y # zSentential adverbs have a most peculiar attribute when they inter-act with natural language negation.
The adverb can be either insideor outside the scope of the negation.
Sentences (5) and (6) point outthe two possible interpretations in the case of 'too'.
One particularlyinteresting phenomenon is that all of the possible scopes of the nega-tion and the adverb may not occur in surface form.
For instance,(6) would normally be uttered as 'BILL didn't kick the ball, either.
'.I will use the incorrect surface form in the examples, however.
Theitalicized portions of the sentences indicate the portion which is inthe scope of 'too'.
(5) is to be interpreted as: Although someone lsekicked the ball, Bill didn't.
(6) is to be interpreted as: Both Bill andsomeone lse did not kick the ball.
(5) BILL didn't kick the ball, too.
(6) BILL didn't kick the ball, too.The representations for the unnegated 'BILL kicked the ball, too.
'and the sentences (5) and (6) are shown in (7)-(9), respectively.
Asproposed in /Kempson 1975/, /Wilson 1975/, and implemented in/Mercer 1987/, the representation f the simple negation of the sen-tence 'BILL kicked the ball, too.'
is just the wide-scoped negationas shown in (8).
I have shown the right-hand side equivalents of theappropriate representations so that I can contrast he two differentuegatlons.
(7) KICK(Bil l ,  ball) A 3x.KICK(x, ball) A x ~ Bill4A positive indication to the negation test means that a sentence, 8, containingthe purported presuppositionai environment and the preferred interpretation fnot S both have the same inferences arising from the environment i  question.
(8) -,\[KICIt( Bill, ball) A -lx.KIClf(x, ball) A x ?
Bill\](9) -~KIG'l( ( Bill, ball) A Hx...~KICK (x, ball) A x ~ BillWhat is important for tile presuppositional analysis is that only(8) can be a candidate for the negation test.
One of the prerequi-sites of this test is that the supposed presuppositional environment iswithin the scope of the logical negation in the logical representationof the sentence.
The logical representation f (9) does not meet thisrequirement.3.2 Aga i  aThe situation for the sententia| dverb, 'again', is somewhat similarto that described above for 'too'.
The adverb can be inside or outsidethe scope of the negation.
Accordingty~ the adverbs found in (10) and(11) are the presupl)ositional and non-presuppositional enviromnentswith respect o the positive sentence 'Fred called again,'.
(10) is tobe interpreted as: At some time in the past Fred called and duringsome interwl of time which is important o the context in whichthe sentence is uttered, Fred didn't call.
(11) is to be the followinginterpretation: At some time in the past Fred didn't call and duringsome interval of time which is important to the context in which tilesentence is u~tered, Fred didn't call.
(10) I,'RED didn't call again.
(11) FRED di&~'t call again.Th.e representation for 'call, again' is shown in (12) 5.
(12) VxVyVz.CALL-HUBJ~A GAIN(x, y, z) =-CALL(x, y, z) A 3tl.
CALL(x, y, tt) A tl < zThe representations for the unuegated 'FRED called again.'
and thesentences (1(t) and (11) are shown in (13)-(15), respectively.
As inthe case of 'too', the representation f the simple negation of thesentence 'Fb~ED called again.'
is just the wide-scoped negation asshown in (1+1).
i have shown the right~hand side equiwdeuts of theappropriate representations so that I can contrast he two difihrentnegations.
(13) CALL(Fred, you, t) A :3tj .CALL(16~d, you, h) A tl < t(1.4) -,\[ CAL t,(1,Yed, you, t) A i~tt.
CAI, L( Ft~d, you, 11) A t 1 < t\](15) -,CALL( I;Yed, you, t) h ~tl.
'-,CALL( Fred, you, h) A tl < tAs in the case for 'too', the only representation f 'again' thatsanctions the use of presuppositioual machinery is (14) s.4 Two Approaches to the Prob lem of Sen-~tent ia l  AdverbsNow I ca~ turn to these sententiM adverbs occurring in more com-plex situations~ in particular, examples imilar to those provided in/Soaanes 1982/.
The two examples hown in (1.6) and (17) are thekinds of situations which prove difficult for all projection methods.
(16) if JOHN kicked the ball, then BILL kicked the ball, too.
(17) If Fred called yesterday, then he will call again,SThis representation c veys only oac foci of the adverb, 'again', in this c~e,the subject.
The object of 'calP, which in this case weald have to be recoveredfrom cow, textual cues (it would pt'obably be 'yon' or 'us', though it could bc aihird party) can be focussed as well.
Since the discussion is similar to that givenfor ~too ~, I will omit it.SThis is of coarse with cespect to the ~eutence r presented by (13).4.1 Soames  ) ApproachTile method proposed in /Soames (1982)/ is based upon the beliefthat the two major competing strategies for determining presupposi-tions (/Karttunen and Peters 1979/and/Gazdar 1979/) succeed inthose situations in which the other one fails.
7 Tile proposed solutionis to synthesize the two filtering strategies so that all the unwantedpotential presuppositions are screened out.The synthesis i performed in the following manner.
First the po-tentialpresuppositionsofthe sentence are computed.
Essentially, thepotential presuppositions are all of tile presuppositions of the indi-vidual clauses of the sentence if the clauses were in isolation.
Theremaining potential presuppositions are those potential presupposi-tions which are not contextually or eonversationMly cancelled.
Thisstep is basically Gazdar~s method for generating the presuppositionsof the sentence.
The next step is to use these remaining potentialpresuppositions in the projection phase which is basically the oneproposed by Karttunen and Peters.Since all of the examples that Mlow deal only with qf .
.
.
then'sentences, I will provide only the projection rule for this kind ofsentence.
8If S :='If A then B', then the actual presuppositions of S arethose entailed byA P ^ (Ar 79 B y)where eP represents he actual presupposition f ?.A further aspect of this rule is that if A T D B P is true only for truth-conditional reasons or is a logically valid statement, hen this partof the conjunct is ignored.
Otherwise, the 'A T D' is dropped giviugA P A B P as tlle presupposition f the sentence 5'.This projection method can be applied to a variety of examples.Since I am concerned only with the characteristics of the presup-positional environment 'too' in these examples only those potentialpresuppositions that are relevant will be mentioned in the anMysis.
(16) has the following properties.No potential presuppositions are derived from the an-tecedent clause.A T 79 B P = John kicked the ball D somebody (~ Bill)kicked the ballSince A T D B p is logically valid it is ignored, tIence (16)has no actual presuppositions.Similar analyses give no presupposition for (18) and the pre,mpposi.-tion 'Somebody (~ John) kicked the ball.'
for (19).
(18) BILL kicked the ball, too, if JOIIN kicked the ball.
(19) If JOIIN kicked the ball too, then BILL kicked the ballIa order to generate no presuppositions for (20), /So~mes 1979/requires an extra rule and a somewhat suspect method of interpreta-tion.
A description of the extra rule is not needed here.
tiowever, aquick look at the accompanying method of interpretation is of someimportance.
In order for the extra rule to work properly, the clauseB in the sentence 'Bi fA'  must tirst be interpreted am an assertion.This error is undone when the ' if A' portion is heard.
But what isimportant is the appropriate presuppositions have been c;mcelled bythis point, tIowever, it seems that stress patterns on the llnal wordof B when uttered as a sentence and when uttered as the lirst clauseof 'Bi fA'  differ.
Hence no hearer would interpret B as an asser-tion.
Without this peculiar interpretation, Soames' method cannotcorrectly generate the presuppositions for (20).
(20) BILL ldcked the ball, if JOIIN kicked the ball ~oo.~/Mercer 1987/ shows th~tt here are situations not covered ly the anion otthcsc two methods.aThis rule is a slightly simplified version of the one given in/So,.mcs 1982/.
Itis sufficient for this discussion.4234.2 A Defau l t  Log ic  ApproachThe default rule schemata which capture the presuppositionai in-ferences for the adverbs, 'too' and 'again', are (21) and (22), re-spectively.
In the case of 'kick too' and 'call again' the appropriateinstances of these schemata are shown in (23) and (24), respectively.

CALL(x, y, t') A t' < tGiven simple statements such as those in (25) and (26) the pre-ferred interpretations can be derived from the representation f thesentence and the appropriate default rules.
I have shown the rep-resentation for (25) in (27).
The preferred interpretation of (25) isshown in (28).
Similar representations can be derived for the pre-ferred interpretation of (26).

The rep-resentation of ' i f  a then b' is not equivalent o a D b. Howevera D b can be derived fi'om standard representations for ' if a thenb' such as Stalnaker's conditional logic representation, a > b (/Stal-naker 1968/).
The theory presented in/Mercer 1987, 1988/ definespresuppositions a inferences derivable from a theory which includesthe representation f the sentence.
Therefore the logical form a D bwill be available to the deductive machinery.
For any sentence of theform ' i f  a then b,, the KBH U {Ksu} will be{Zs(a > b), 'appropriate default rules'}and since Ks(a D b) is derivable from Ks(a > b) and since Ks(a D b)is equivalent to Ks(~ayb) the two cases determined by the algorithmgiven in section 2.3.2 are{ a A b, 'appropriate default rules'} and{,a  ^  -,b, 'appropriate default rules'}.The complexity arises in the case of sentential dverbs being in ei-ther the antecedent or consequent clause of the ' i f .
.
.
then' sentencesunder investigation because the negation which appears in one of thecases can be done in two possible ways wheat a sentential adverb iscontained in the clause being negated.
If the negation of the conse-quent clause does not put the sentential adverb in the scope of thenegation, the default rule which generates the presupposition cannotbe used.
The case --a ^  -,b does not infer the presupposition.
Conse-quently, the case analysis cannot generate the presupposition as aninference from the sentence.How is the method of negation justified?
Two assumptions mustbe made.
Firstly, the antecedent of an ' i f  .
.
.
then' sentence is logi-cally prior to the consequent.
This logical assymetry can be derivedfi'om Stainaker's analysis, or the cause and effect relationship that isconveyed by this sentence schema.
Secondly,/Stalnaker 1973/givesan argument that ' i f .
.
.
then' sentences are to be interpreted in amanner that is similar to conjunctive sentences.
Stainaker's view ofconjunctions i that the second sentence is affected by the presenceof the first sentence.
I will loosely interpret his to include the waythe sentence is represented.
Therefore if there is a sentential adverbin the second conjunct, it should interact with any negations in sucha way as to have the same interpretation as in the first clause.
Forexample, (29) should have the representation given in (30).
(29) JOIIN didn't kick the ball and BILL didn't kick the ball, too.
(30) -,KICK(John, ball) A -,KICK(Bil l ,  ball)A3z.-,KICK ( z, ball) A Bill # zItowever, in (31.)
since the first clause does not contain any negationthat would affect the interpretation of the negation in the secondclause, the negation in the second clause would follow the standardclanse-scoping egation rule.
The representation for (31) is given in(32).
This representation together with the appropriate default rulethen produces the presupposition 'Somebody (~- Bill) did not kick theball.'.
(31) Today is not Sunday and BILL didn't kick the ball, too.
(32) -1 Today is Sunday A ~\[ KICI( ( Bill, ball) A3z.KICK(z,  ball) A Bill ~ z\]For any sentence of the form ' ira then b', the two cases determinedby the algorithm given in section 2.3.2 are a A b and ~a A -,b. Therepresentations for the second case for each of the sentences (16),(18), (19), and (20) are given in (33)-(36), respectively.
The nega-tion in (33) is within the scope of the adverb because the adverboccurs in the consequent and because the antecedent is logically (azMconversationally) prior to the consequent.
Therefore the scoping isdictated by that in the antecedent clause.
Similar analyses can begiven for (34) and (36).
In (34) the adverb occurs in the consequent,hence the scoping is dictated by the logicMly prior antecedent, in(36) the adverb is in the antecedent, but because the consequent iscoaversationMly prior to the antecedent, it dictates the scoping ofthe negation in the antecedent.
In all of these cases the scope ofthe negation prevents the use of the presuppositionai default rnlesto derive the presupposition that would be derived from the clauseif it appeared in isolation.
Only in (35) does the logically and con-versationaily prior antecedent contain the adverb.
The scope of thenegation is therefore determined by the normal scoping rule, hencethe scope of the negation is the whole clause placing the adverb insidethe scope of the negation, and giving the appropriate presupposition.

To circumvent this problem, /Landman 1981/ intro-duces extra clausal implicatures into the method proposed in /Gaz-dar 1979/.
This proposal has been effectively argued against in/Soames 1982/./Soaznes 1982/ has enlarged the set of counterexamples found in/Soames 1979/.
Motivated by the lack of explanation for these rea-sonably simple examples, he constructs a new approach which is asuperset of the methods proposed by/Gazdax 1979/and/Kart tunenand Peters 1979/.
This rococo approach to naturM lazlguage presup-positions has been argued against on methodological nd empiricallines in/Mercer 1987/.By reappraising the insightful counterexamples to Gazdar's theorygiven in/Soaznes 1982/, it is noticed that the semantic representationo f ' i f .
.
,  then' sentences that contain a sententiM adverb in either the424antecedent or consequent clause plays an important role in determin-ing the presuppositions of the sentence.
The inferential theory fornatural anguage presuppositions described in \]Mercer 1987, 1988\]gives a simlde and straightforward explanation for the presupposi-tions\] nature of these sentences.ReferencesGa~dar, G.
