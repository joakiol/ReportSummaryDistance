A MODEL FO\](~ 'D IL~SFER CONTROL IN THE METAL MT-SYS'rEMJmm A. ALONSOSiemens CDSe/Luis Mitntada% 5CORNELLA, 08940-BARCELONA, SpainA~stractTa.~ p~esant paper tries to outlln~ a model to~nhanc~ tile trm~sfer control within the N~T;d. MachineTranslation, System.
The model is being currently tested Anth~ ~srman-Spanish system which is under development inBarcelona and relies upon techniques belonging to the GPSGframework.
The central idea is to extract from the transferpart of th,~ phrase structure rules currently used by METALall the :4elevant generalizable information about featuretraffic and control dependences, and put at in form oflanguage-dependent tables.
This infomnaticn is then accessedand h~mdled by a few high-level rule operators, calledduring th,~ transfe~ process, implementing three generalfeature pz:~nciples.
The grammar writer is thereby relievedfrom the todinus task of controlling all the feature trafficbetween nodes, this resulting in a clea~er, shorter andsafer grab,mr for the system.L- Introduction?~2h\[s paper, presents a proposal for the applicationof so~e G~3G-based teclu*iqees on the ~.~TAL ~I'?
syst~,~ ~iththe ai~l of endowing the systea with a stzonge~ control inthe ~iransf~r Phase.%%8 ce~tral idea upon which this Yrm~sfer Control,Lodel is eased is to provide the grmmnar w~'ite~ with at~.oufo~tabls and safe means fez' keeping as much featuretraffic as possible cont~olled in the Transfer Phase of thet~anslatioa process in METAl,.
Currently, any kind offeature traffic between nodes must be explicitely stated inthe ~'ules, and the same happens ~ith the ck~ild nodet_~ansfe~ ~t'ocess (Control Dependences).\[(t seems reasonable to think that a great deal ofbot~.~ this feature traffic between nodes and the controldependences with~u the t~ansfer phase could be generalized~ud ~:tated outside the rifles, in form of lan~age-dependenttables which would the~ be accessed by a few generaloperato~ called in the rtiles (implementing the principlesproposed l:elow).
The gram~m~ ~riter would thus be relievedfi'e.~ thi~', task, all this resulting iu sho~ter, clearer andless e~e~'p~one rules.~ost of the ideas conforming the model presentedhe~:~ have be~a~ t~keu f~:om the ~PSG framework \[Gazda~ 85\].The original idea was to directly apply the &~SG principlesI;o the syste~b since, basically, ME'2~, disposes of thenecessary structure for it (i.e., it is a PS-based systen band thus, it works with structu~.al d~scriptions \[trees\]consisting of bundles of featu~e~value pai~s \[nodes\]).However, the fact that the GPSG model was originallyconceived for analysis (transfer being quite a differentproblem) and that METAL lacks mechanisms which are centralto the GPSG model, like LP/ID ~ules, metarules, FSD and FCR,etc., showed the unpracticability of such a direct appruach.This is why the idea became to adapt som~ 0?
the ideasoffered by the GPSG (mostly the CAP and the HFC universalfeature inst~tiatioa principle~) and we~fo~mulate th~ sothat they can be us~!d fez 0an purposes.2.- Fundmnenta ls  of the NtETAL systet , .METAL is  a Cha~t'opar~erHdrivan Phi:ass Stru(:tuz'ebased MT system, which reflects the classic MT scheme o~fAnalysis, Transfer and Generation phases.
During theAnalysis Phase, METAL builds from each input sou:,:'ce imlsussesentence one or more structural descriptions {henceforthtrees), consisting of nodes, which in turn consist of anumber of Feature-Value pairs (henceforth f~v-pairs), )inthe Transfer Phase, the trees obtained in the analysis areconverted into equivalent trees adapted to the targetlanguage needs.
After this, the Generation Phase genes'stemthe output sentence/s in the target language , using thetransfer trees as input.Apa~-t from the lexical DBs METAL has some 500 PSrules, whose form can roughly be described as follows:19<RULE.IDENTIFIER>NODE-STRUCTURE <e.g, "NP --> DET NO">TEST <Tests on nodes to be satisfied in order for therule to apply>CONSTR <Analysis-Tree Construction part> ~NALYSIS PARTINTEGR <Anaphora Resolution part> TRANSFER PARTTRANSFER <Transfer-Tree construction part>During the Analysis phase, only the analysis part ofthe succeeding rules apply, building the analysis tree in abottom-up manner until a S node is reached.
Once theanalysis tree has been thus built, the Transfer Phasestarts; the transfer part of the rules applied duringanalysis activates now, climbing down the tree from top tobottom until the terminal nodes are transferred.
When theTransfer Process applies on a node N, with f-v-pairs F-V,the child nodes of N are also transferred (and the childnodes of these, and so on, until terminal nodes arereached).
Once all the branching nodes dominated by N havebeen transferred, the transfer process returns control tothe father of N, which now bears target-language updatedf-v-pairs F-V'.Two tasks central to the Transfer Process are theFeature Traffic (i.e., ,hich f-v-pairs need to be sent upand down in which moment, and from which node to whichnode/s), and the handling of Control Dependences (i.e.,which child node of one analysis tree or sub-trme\[henceforth local tree\] must be transferred first, in orderfor other slbling nodes to be able to be rightlytransferred).The two mentioned tasks ere now handled by theGrammar writer in the Transfer part of the t~TAL GrammarRules through calls to "low level" feature traffic operators(i.e., copy one or more f-v-pairs from the root node to achild node, from one child node to another sibling node, orfrom one child node to the root node).What the present Transfer Control Model proposes isto extract from the rules ell which can be generalizable inthis process regarding feature traffic and controldependences end carry it out through calls to a few "highlevel" operators which use information stored in the syst~database in form of tables stating which f-v-pairs must bepresent in a given node, which nodes are controllers, endwhich other nodes are oontrollees within a given local tree.3.- Basic Definitions.In this section there follows a number ofdefinitions which will be used throughout the rest of thepaper.3.1.- Local tree.A local tree is a part of a structural descriptionwhich is currently being dealt with by the particular rulewhich is under consideration.
For example, given an analysistree of the formCLS \[I\]/ \DET NO\[2\]/ \ADJ N013\]/ \NST N-FLEXin which the number between \[\] indicates (for reference) therule which has built this particular node, the local treewhen rule \[2\] is applied would be: /No{2\]ADO NO\[3)whereas the local tree for rule \[3\] would be/Nof3I .NST N-FLEX3.2.- Types of nodesRoot Node \[RN\]:* The root \[parent\] node of a local  tree.Head Node \[HN\]:* In case Control Dependences (see below) exist  withinthe current local tree, the Head Node is thecontroller node.
Otherwise, the Head Node must beegplicitely stated for each particular treestructure, normally being the X(BAR-I) child node,in a local tree d~inated by a root node X(BAR)Notice that this definition of Head Node has beentailored ad-hoc for this model end deviates considerablyfro~ the traditional notion of Head in the X-bar theory, forinstance.Dependent  Node \[DN\]:A chi ld node of the local  t ree which is  control ledbya  ~,Free Node \[FN\]:A chi ld node of the local  t ree which i s  notcontrol led by any HN.20Lex iea l  Node \ [LN\] :A t t~rainal  ex ica l  node.3?3- Type,~ o f  FeaturesHead Feat lwes  \ [HF \ ] :* A s~t of f-v-pairs which must be present with thesome values both in the Bead Node and in the BootNode in some precise momenta during the TranslationProcess.Lexical Access Features \[LAF\]:* A ll~t of f-v-pairs Which must be present in theLex/Lcal Nodes nodes prior to their transference intothe target language.Contro l  Features  \ [CF\ ] :* A sect of f-v-pairs which must be copied from theBead Node s into the Dependent Node/s after the HeadNod~ has been transferred and before the DependentN~le/a is/are transferred.3.4 .
-Cent ra l  Dependence  Between Nodes* A H~ad Node \[HN\] cont ro l s  one or more DependantNC~J~/S \[DN\] within a local tree if in order for theDN/4 to be properly transferred, It/they must have aset of f-v-pairs whose particular values are to beupdated with those values borne by the HN after thisn~i~3 has been transferred.Bad:really, our notion of Control coincides with theone given by the GKPS \[Gazder 85 \ ] .
Control is alanguage-dependent relationship between nodes, in whichthere  i s  a cont ro l le r  node and one or  more contgu l leenode/s, which ultimately subsumes the concept of agreement(subject-predicate, noun-adjective, etc.).
In the TransferProcess, nodes which are controllers must be transferredprior to their controlleas, in order to ensure the rightagreement b~tween them in the target language.Not:.~cs that  a loca l  t ree  may present  d i f fe rent  typesof Control l~pendences (see Fig.
I), with one Dependent Node(the NP\[2\] z~ode below, dominating a loca l  t ree  where the  NOnode controJ.s the DET node for Gender and Number), with twoDependent Nodes (the CLS node dominating a local tree wherethe NP\[$SUBJ\] controls both the PRED node for Person andNumSer and the ~DJ node for Gender and Number), or noDependent Nodes at all (the PP node dominating a local, treewhere neitht,r the NP node nor the PREP nodes control eachother) :CLS\[$so~J\] -c ..... > PREy AoJNP\[2\] PP I CD2 I/ \ / \  I ID~-T NO PREP ~ I II < ' - "  I I I I II CO I I I I I !

* Copying the Control Features (CFs) set from thealready transferred Head Node into the DependentNode/s {if any).
* Transfer the Dependent Node/s, and the Free Node/s(if any).4.- Genera l  In fo rmat ion  to  be  Supp l ied  to  the  System DBBasically, three types of information must be storedinto the system DB end used later on by the TransferProcess.
Physically, this information is implemented in formof a LISP list, although this is purely a parochialprogra~ing dec is ion .4.1.- HEAD Feature  L i s t  \ [HFL \ ] :It contains information stating which f-v-pairs arecons idered to  be members of  the set  HEAD.
The dec is ion ofwhich f -v-pairm must be HF?D members i s  c ruc ia l  to  themodel.
In a f i r s t  approach, we w i l l  adopt a pragmat ica lc r i te r ion .
This means that  we w i l l  inc lude as HEAD featuresthose f -v -pa i rs  which are cur rent ly  perco la ted  in thecorresponding gules, and which we make sure are actuallyneeded for the Transfer Process.However, the aim is to extrapolate from this firstapproach a (maybe language-dependent) theoretical hypothesisabout HEAD Features which enables to state a generalcr i te r ion  to  es tab l i sh  the HF membership.214.2.-  Lcx iea l  Access  Tab le  |LkT \ ] :It contains L~/~GUAGE-DEPENDENT information statingwhich sets of f-v-pairs (Lsxical Access Features \[LAF\]) areneeded in order for each (major) Lexlcal Node to be rightlytransferred.
Xn METAL, Isxical nodes are transferred bycalling the XLX operator in the TRANSFER p~rt of thecorresponding rules.
XLX takes ar~t'~ents specifying theneeded target lan@uage stem retrieval information for agiven category, whether an inflsxion must be attached to thestem, and the retrieval information for this inflsxion.Thus, the LAT table contains information about Lexical %Access Features, Inflexion Attachement infoz~atinn (whenneeded) and Inflection Lexical Access Features (ILAF).
Infact, this would be quite similar to the NLX table proposedby Tommy Loomis in \[Loomis 87\].Here is a schematic example of the Lexical Access Table:S PANIS II-LA T:LN !

Thecontrol features (CF) relevant for this structure are ~IU(number) and PS (person).
Moreover, a sibling ADJ node mayalso be a Dependent Node, with control features GD (Gender)and NU (Number).
This CTT entry controls thesubject-predicate, and the subject-predlcativeadjective (incopulative sentences) agreement requirements, respectively.The same should be stated for each gra~mmticalcategory which may be a Root Node Of a local tree (CLS,PRED, NO, etc.
).%~o things must be stressed about the CTT table:* Information about particular feature values can begiven to distinguish between sategorins with the same n~s(for instance, to ensure that for the subject-predicateagreement, the controller is the ~ which bears the role ofSUBJect, and not some other sibling ~) .
* Each CTT entry must have at lea~t a Head Nodespecified for each Root Node, and possibly ons nz mor~Dependent Nodes, which may or may not be obligatory, withtheir corresponding control features.
This accounts fo~: thepossibility of having different local trees dominated by thesame Root Node categoz T (the case of CLS, above).5.- Bas ic  \ ]~r inc ip lesIn a first approach, three Horkin~ Principles san bestated for the ~TAL  Transfer Phase.
