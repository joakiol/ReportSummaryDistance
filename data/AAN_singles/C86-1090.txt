On the Use of Term Associations in Automatic Information RetrievalGerard Salton*AbstractIt has been recognized that single words extracted from natural language texts are notalways useful for the representation of information content.
Associated or related terms,and complex content identifiers derived from thesauruses and knowledge bases, or constructedby automatic word grouping techniques, have therefore been proposed for text identificationpurposes.The area of associative content analysis and information retrieval is reviewed in thisstudy.
The available experimental evidence shows that none of the existing or proposedmethodologies are guaranteed to improve retrieval performance in a replicable manner fordocument collections in different subject areas.
The associative techniques are most valu-able for restricted environments covering narrow subject areas, or in iterative search situa-tions where user inputs are available to refine previously available query formulations andsearch output.I.
IntroductionComputers were first used for the process-ing of natural language texts over 30 years ago.From the beginning it has been recognized thatthe individual words contained in the texts ofwritten documents could be used in part to pro-vide a representation of document content.
Atthe same time it was generally accepted thatcertain words, or word sets, would not producemeaningful content identifiers.
In particular,some quite broad words, such as the term "com-puter" used to identify computer science litera-ture, would be useless for distinguishing onedocument from another.
Other very specificterms would be so rare that no single item in acollection might reasonably be described by sucha very rare term.To improve the operations of text process-ing systems, it has been suggested that the ori-ginal document vocabulary be expanded by addingrelated or associated terms not originallypresent in the available text samples.
Two maintypes of vocabulary relationships can be recog-nized in this connection, known respectively asand ~ relations.
\[I\]The paradigmetric relations cover term associa-tions, such as synonyms and hierarchical inclu-sion, that always exist between particular termsregardless of the context in which these termsare used.
For example, a paradigmatic relationexists between the name of a country (say,France) and the capital city (Paris).
Syntag.-matie relations, on the other hand, are rela-tions which are not valid outside some specifiedcontext.
For example, a cause-effect relationmay be detected in certain circumstances between"poison" and "death H.Department of Computer Science, Cornell Univer-sity, Ithaca, NY 14853.This study was supported in part by the NationalScience Foundation under grants IST 83-16166 andIST 85-44189,380The paradigmatic relations may be identi-fied by using precoustructed dictionaries, orthesauruses, containing schedules or groupingsof related terms or concepts.
The syntagmaticrelations, on the other hand, must be derived byanalyzing particular text samples and extractingthe term relationships specified in these texts.Various methods are outlined in the nextsection for utilizing paradigmatic and syntag-matic term associations in text processing sys-tems, and the effectiveness of the methods isassessed using available experimental output.2.
Associative Text Processing MethodsA) Thesaurus OperationsA thesaurus is a word grouping device whichprovides a hierarchical and/or a clusteredarrangement of the vocabulary for certain sub-ject areas.
Thesauruses are used in text pro-cessing for three main purposes \[2\]:a) as authority lists where the thesaurus nor-malizes the indexing vocabulary by distin-guishing terms that are allowed as contentidentifiers from the remainder of the voca-bulary;b) as grouping devices where the vocabulary isbroken down into classes of related, orsynonymous terms, as in the traditionalRogetWs thesaurus;c) as term hierarchies where more generalterms are broken down into groups of nar-rower terms, that may themselves be brokendown further into still narrower groups.When a thesaurus is available for a partic-ular subject area, each term found in a documentcan be used as an entry point into thethesaurus, and additional (synonymous orhierarchically related) terms included in thesame thesaurus class as the original can be sup-plied.
Such a thesaurus operation normalizesthe vocabulary and provides additional opportun-ities for matches between query and documentvocabularies.
The vocabulary expansion tends toenhance the search recall (the proportion ofrelevant materials actually retrieved as aresult of a search process).When the subject area is narrowly cir-cumscribed and knowledgeable subject experts areavailable, useful thesaurus arrangements can hemanually constructed by human experts that mayprovide substantial enhancements in retrievaleffectiveness.
Table 1 shows the average searchprecision (the proportion of retrieved materialsactually relevant) obtained at certain fixedrecall points for a collection of 400 documentsin engineering used with 17 search requests.
Inthat case, the performance of a manually con-structed thesaurus (the Harris Three thesaurus)is compared with a content analysis system basedon weighted word stems extracted from documentand query texts.
The output of Table 1 showsthat at the high recall end of performancerange, the thesaurus provides much betterzetrieval output than the word stem process.\[3\]Average Search PrecisionRecall \] Weighted Word Harris ThreeStems Thesaurus- -  i. i  I .9563?

It was hoped early on, thatthesaurses could be built automatically bystudying the occurrence characteristics of theterms in the documents, and grouping into commonthesaurus classes those terms that co-occur suf-ficiently often in the text of the documents:\[4\]"the statistical material that may berequired in the manual compilation of dic-tionaries and thesauruses may be derivedfrom the original texts in any desired formand degree of detail.
"Later is was recognized that thesauruses con-structed by using the occurrence characteristicsof the vocabulary in the documents of" a collec-tion do not in fact provide generally validparadigmatic temn relations, but identifyinstead locally valid syntagmatic relationsderivable from the particular document environ-ment.
\[5\] To utilize the conventional paradig-matic te~l relations existing in particular sub-ject areas, the vocabulary arrangements musteffectively be constructed by subject expertsusing largely ad-hoc procedures made up for eachparticular occasion.
The thesaurus method istherefore not generally usable in operationalenvironments.B) Automatic Term AssociationsWhile generally valid thesauruses are dif-ficult to build, locally valid f~Km~di~aILig/ lcan be generated automatically by makinguse of similarity measurements between pairs ofte~mls based, for example, on the number of docu-ments in which the terms co-occur in the docu-ments of a collection?
The number of commonsentences in which a pair of words can be foundmay also be taken into account, as well as somemeasure of proximity between the words in thevarious texts.
Using similarity measurementsbetween word pairs, term association maps can beconstructed, and these may be displayed and usedby the search personnel to formulate usefulquery statements, and to obtain expanded docu-ment representations.

For example, and T_may be grouped because these te appea~jointly in documents D I and D2; similarity termsT 1 and T 6 appear in aocuments D 1 and D 4.
Thegrouping operations may be used to obtain a termassociation map of the kind shown in Fig.
l(c),where associated temDs are joined by lines onthe map.The operations of a typical associativ~system are illustrated in Fig.
2.\[7\] The original query words are listed on theleft-hand side of Fig.
2, and the derived asso-ciated terms are shown on the right.
The valueof a given associated term--for example, "Inter unational Organizations"-- is computed as the sumof the term association values between the giventerm and all origilml query tez~s (0.5 for~IUnited Nations" plus 0.4 for "Pan AmericanUnion" in the example of Fig.

Finally theretrieval value of a document is computed as thesum of the common term association values forall matching terms that are present in bothqueries and documents.
Many variations are pos-sible of the basic scheme illustrated in Fig.

2In practice, it is found that the use ofterm associations can improve the search recallby providing new matches between the termassigned to queries and documents that were notavailable in the original query and document.In addition, the search precision can also beenhanced by reinforcing the strength of alreadyexisting term matches.
\[5\] Unfortunately, theexperimental evidence indicates that only about20 percent of automatically derived associationsbetween pairs of terms are semantically signif i -cant; the associative indexing process does nottherefore provide guaranteed advantages inretrieval effectiveness.Table 2 shows a typical evaluation outputfor a collection of 400 documents in engineeringused with 17 search requests.
The output ofTable 2 shows that the automatic term associa-tions provide an increase in average search pre-cision only at the high recall end of the per-formance range.
Overall, the average searchprecision decreases by 13 percent for the col-lection used in Table 2.

\[9-10\] Once again, the evaluationresults were disappointing: \[10\]hOur results on query expansion using theNPL data are disappointing.
We have notbeen able to achieve any significantimprovements over nonexpansion.
We haverepeated previous experiments in which thequery was expanded, and the resulting setof search terms then weighted... Onceagain the results have been conflicting..,"The conclusions derived from the availableevidence indicate that the vocabulary expansiontechniques which add to the existing contentidentifiers related terms specified in athesaurus, or derived by term co-occurrencemeasurements, do not provide methods for improv-ing retrieval effectiveness.
Generally validthesauruses for large subject areas are diffi-cult to generate and the automatic term co-occurrence procedures do not offer adequatequality control.
Efforts to enhance the recallperformance of search systems must therefore bebased on different techniques designed to gen-erate indexing vocabularies of broader scope,including especially word stem generation andsuffix truncation methods.C) Term Phrase GenerationThe vocabulary expansion methods describedup to now are designed principally to improvesearch recall.
Search precision may be enhancedby using narrow indexing vocabularies consistinglargely of JL&I~B p ~  replacing the normallyused single terms.
Thus "computer science" or"computer programming" could replace a broaderterm such as 'tcaleu1~tor" or "computer".
Therecognition and aesig u ent of term phrases posesmuch the same probems as the previouslydescribed generation of term associations andthe expansion of indexing vocabularies.
In par-ticular, an accurate determination of usefulte~,l phrases, and the rejection of extraneousphrases, must he based on syntactic analyses ofquery and document texts suppl~nented by semen=tic components valid for the subject areas underconsideration.
Unfortunately, complete linguis-tic analyses of topic areas of reasonable scopeare unavailable for reasons of efficiency aswell as effectiveness.
In practice, it is thennecessary to fall back on simpler phrase genera-tion methods in which phrases are identified assequences of co-occurring terms with appropriatestatistical and/or syntactic properties.
Insuch simple phrase generation environments qual-ity control is, however, difficult to achieve.The following phrase generation methods areof main interest:a) statistical methods where each phrase \ ]~(the main phrase component) bas a statedminimal occurrence frequency in the textsunder consideration, and each phraseexhibits another stated minimaloccurrence frequency, and the distance innumber of intervening words between phraseheads and phrase components is limited to astated number of words;b) a simple syntactic pattern matching methodwhere a dictionary search method is used toassign syntactic indicators to the textelements, and phrases are then recognizedas sequences of words exhibiting certainpreviously established patterns of syntac-tic indications (e.g.
adjective-noun-noun,or preposition-adjective-noun); \[11-12\]c) a more complete syntactic analysis methodsupplemented if possible by appropriatesemantic restrictions to control thevariety of permitted syntactic phrase con-structions for the available texts.
\[13,14\]When statistical phrase generation methodsare used, a large number of useful phrases canin fact be identified, together unfortunatelywith a large number of improper phrases that aredifficult to reject on formal grounds.
Forexample, given a query text such as"h~nophilia and christmas disease, espe-cially in regard to the specific complica-tion of pseudotumor formation (occurrence,pathogenesis, treatment, prognosis)'it is easy to produce correct phrase combina-tions such as "christmas disease" and "pseudotu-mor formation".
At the same time the statist:i-cal phrase formation process produces inap-propriate patterns such as "formationoccurrence '~ and "complication formation"?
\[15\]Overall a statistical phrase formation processwill be of questionable usefulness.Table 3 shows a comparison of the averagesearch precision results for certain fixedrecall values between a standard single termindexing system, and a system where the singleterms are supplemented by statistically deter-mined phrase combinations.
The output of Table3 for four different document collections incomputer science (CACM), documentation (CISI)~medicine (MED) and aeronautics (CRAN) shows thatthe phrase process affords modest averagei~provements for three collections out of four.\[15\] However, the improvement is notguaranteed, and is in any case limited to a fewpercentage points in the average precision.The evaluation results available for tilesyntax-based methods are not much more encourag-ing.
\[16\] The basic syntactic analysisapproach must be able to cope with ordinary wordambiguities (Imllp base, army base, baseballbase), the recognition of distinct syntacticconstructs with identical meanings, discourseproblems exceeding sentence boundaries such aspronoun referents from one sentence to another,Recall.I.3.5.7.9AverageImprovementCACM 3204Single ITerms_\] Phrases.5086 I .5427.3672 I .3971.2398 \] .2527.1462 .1462.0711 .0759+6.8%CISI 1460Single_ Ten,}s Phrases.4919 .4590.3118 .2999.2320 .2222.1504 .1283.0739 .0630-8.6%MED 1033SingleTerms Phrases.8038 .7970.6742 ?7064.5447 .5529.4082 .4166.2057 .2056+1,6%CRANSingleTerm~ Phrases.7526 .7540.5184 .5385.3714 .3989.2301 .2431.1313 .1328+4.1%Comparison of Single Term Indexing with StatisticalPhrase Indexing for Four S~iple Document CollectionsTable 3383and the difficulties of interpreting many com-plex meaning units in ordinary texts.
An illus-tration of the latter kind is furnished by thephrase "high frequency transistor oscillator",where it is important to avoid the interpreta-tion "high frequency transistor" while admitting"transistor oscillator" and "high frequencyoscillator".
A sophisticated syntactic analysissystem with substantial semantic components wasunable in that case to reject the extraneousinterpretations "frequency transistor oscilla-tors which are high (tall)" and "frequencyoscillators using high (tall) transistors".
\[17\]In addition to the problems inherent in thelanguage analysis component of a phrase indexingsystem, a useful text processing component mustalso deal with phrase classification, that isthe recognition of syntactically distinct pat-terns that are semantically identical ("computerprograms", "instruction sets for computers","programs for calculating machines").
Thephrase classification problem itself raises com-plex problems that are not close to solution.\[18\]In summary, the use of complex identifyingunits and term associations in automatic textprocessing environments is currently hampered bydifficulties of a fundamental nature.
The basictheories needed to construct useful term group-ing schedules and thesauruses valid for particu-lar subject areas are not sufficientlydeveloped.
As a result, the effectiveness ofassociative retrieval techniques based on termgrouping and vocabulary expansion leaves some-thing to be desired.
The same is true of thesyntactic and semantic language analysistheories used to generate a large proportion ofthe applicable complex content descriptions andphrases, and to reject the majority of extrane-ous term combinations.The question arises whether any retrievalsituations exists in which it is useful to gobeyond the basic single term text analysismethodology, consisting of the extraction ofsingle terms from natural language query anddocument texts.
This question is examined inthe remaining section of this note.3.
The Usefulness of Complex Text ProcessingThree particular text processing situationscan be identified where term association tech-nlques have proved to be useful.
The first oneis the well-known ~ ~ processwhere initial search operations are conductedwith preliminary query formulations obtainedfrom the user population.
Following theretrieval of certain stored text items, the useris asked to respond by furnishing relevanceassessments for some of the previously retrieveditems; these relevance assessments are then usedby the system to construct new, improved queryformulations which may furnish additional, hope-fully improved, retrieval output.
In particu-lar, the query statements are altered by addingterms extracted from previously retrieved itemsthat were identified as relevant to the user'spurposes, while at the same time removing queryterms included in previously retrieved itemsdesignated as nonrelevant.The relevance feedback methodologyrepresents an associative retrieval technique,since new query terms are obtained from certaindesignated documents that hopefully are relatedto the originally available formulations.Relevance feedback techniques have been usedwith vector queries formulated as sets of searchterms \[9, 19-20\], and more recently with Booleanqueries.
\[21\] The effectiveness of the feedbackprocedure has never been questioned.Table 4 shows typical evaluation output forfour different document collections in terms ofaverage search precision at ten recall points(from a recall of 0.I to a recall of 1.0 insteps of 0.I) averaged over the stated number ofuser queries.
The output of Table 4 applies toBoolean queries with binary weighted terms.
\[21\]The improvements in retrieval precision due tothe user feedback process ranges from 22% to110% for a single search iteration.
When thefeedback process is repeated three timesj theimprovement in search precision increases to 63%to 207%, Evidently, the user relevance informa-tion which applies to particular queries at par-ticular times makes it possible to find a suffi-cient number of interesting term associations tosubstantially improve the retrieval output.A second possibility for generatingimproved retrieval output consists in limitingthe analysis effort to the ~ ~ 1 9 ~/ ~  instead of the document texts.
In arecent study, term phrases were first extractedfrom natural language query texts using a sim-ple, manually controlled, syntactic analysisprocess.
These query phrases were then recog-nized in document texts bY a rough patternOriginal Boolean QueriesFirst Iteration RelevanceFeedbackThird Iteration RelevanceFeedbackMedlars 1033 ClSI 1460 CACM 4204 Inspec 1268430 queries 35 queries 52 queries 77 queries0.1798 0.1159 0.20650.4322(+11o%)0,6334(+207%)0.11180.1367(+22%)0.1827(+63%)0.2550(+42%)0.3217(+79%)0.1522(+31%)0.1933(+67%)Average Search Precision at i0 Recall Points for One Iterationand Throe Iterations of Relevance Feedback (4 document collections)Table 4384matching procedure distinguishing pairs and tri-ples of terms occurring in the same phrases ofdocuments, and pairs and triples of terms occur-ring in the same sentences of documents.
\[22\]Whenever a phrase match is obtained between aquery phrase and a document text, the retrievalweight of the document is appropriatelyincreased.An evaluation of such a manually controlledsyntactic phrase recognition system based onquery statement analysis reveals that substan-tial improvements in retrieval effectiveness areobtainable for the phrase assignments, comparedwith the single term alternatives.

\[23-25\]Various theories of knowledge representation arecurrent, including for example, models based onthe use of frames representing events anddescriptions of interest in a given subject.Frames designating particular entities maybe represented by tabular structures, with openHslots" filled with attributes of the entities,or values of attributes.
Relationships betweenframes are expressed by using attributed thatare themselves represented by other frames, andby adding links between frames.
Frame opera-tions can also be introduced to manipulate theknowledge structure when new facts or entitiesbecome known, or when changes occur in itemrelationships, There is some evidence that whenthe knowledge base needed to analyze the avail-able texts is narrowly circumscribed and limitedin scope, useful frame structures can in fact beintellectually prepared to enhance the retrievaloperations.
\[26\]However, when the needed topic area is notof strictly limited scope, the construction ofuseful knowledge bases is much less straightfor-ward and the knowledge-based processing tech-niques become of limited effectiveness.
It hasbeen suggested that: in these circumstances, thesystem user himself might help in building theknowledge structures.
\[27\] While this remainsa possibility, it is hard to imagine thatuntrained users can lay out the subjectknowledge of interest in particular areas andspecify concept relationships such as synonyms,generalizations, instantiations, and cross-references with sufficient accuracy.
In anycase, no examples exist at the present timewhere user constructed knowledge bases haveproved generally valid for different collectionsin particular subject areas.
In fact, thesituation appears much the same as it was thirtyyears ago: it seems quite easy to build locallyvalid te~ association systems by ad-hoc means;these tools fail however in somewhat differentenvironments, and do not furnish reliable meansfor improving text processing systems in gen-eral.For the foreseeable future, text processingsystems using complex information identifica-tions and term associations must therefore belimited to narrowly restricted topic areas, ormust alternatively be based on simple userinputs, such as ~ocument relevance data, t:hatcan be furnished by untrained users withoutundue hardship.References\[ i \ ]\[ 2\]\[ 3\]\[ 4\]\[ 5\]\[ 6\]\[ 73\[ 83J.Co Gardin, Syntol, in Systems for theIntellectual Organization of Information,S.
