This analysis enables us to iden-tify a category of V+V complex predi-cates called lexical compound verbs(LCpdVs) which need to be stored in thedictionary.
Based on the linguistic analy-sis, a simple automatic method has beendevised for extracting LCpdVs from cor-pora.
We achieve an accuracy of around98% in this task.
The LCpdVs thus ex-tracted may be used to automaticallyaugment lexical resources like wordnets,an otherwise time consuming and labour-intensive process1 IntroductionComplex predicates (CPs) abound in SouthAsian languages [Butt, 1995; Hook, 1974] pri-marily as either, noun+verb combinations (con-junct verbs) or verb+verb (V+V) combinations(compound verbs).
This paper discusses the lat-ter.Of the many V+V sequences in Hindi, only asubset constitutes true CPs.
Thus, we first needdiagnostic tests to differentiate between CP and?

Of the CPs thus iso-lated, we need to distinguish between those CPsthat are formed in the syntax (derivationally) andthose that are formed in the lexicon (LCpdVs) inorder to include only the latter  in lexical knowl-edge bases.
Further, automatic extraction ofLCpdVs from electronic corpora and their inclu-sion in lexical knowledge bases is a desirablegoal for languages like Hindi, which liberally useCPs.This paper discusses Hindi Verb+Verb (V+V)CPs and their automatic extraction from a corpus.1.1 Related workAlsina (1996) discusses the general theory ofcomplex predicates.
Early work on conjunct andcompound verbs in Hindi appears in Burton-Page(1957) and Arora (1979).
Our work on diagnostictests for CPs, as reported here, has been inspiredby Butt (1993, 1995 for Urdu) and Paul (2004,for Bengali).
The analysis of lexical derivation ofLCpdVs derives from the work on compoundverbs by Abbi (1991, 1992) and Gopalkrishnanand Abbi (1992).This work is motivated primarily by the needto automatically augment lexical networks suchas the Princeton Wordnet (Miller et.
al., 1990)and the Hindi Wordnet (Narayan et.
al., 2002).Pasca (2005) and Snow et.
al.
(2006) report workon such augmentations by processing web docu-ments.To the best of our knowledge ours is the firstattempt at automatic extraction of LCpdVs fromHindi corpora.271.2 Organization of the paperSection 2 discusses CPs in Hindi and the ways todistinguish them from other, similar looking,constructions.
Section 3 discusses the automaticextraction of CPs from corpora.
Section 4 con-cludes the paper.2 V+V Complex Predicates in HindiWe have identified five different types of V+Vsequences in Hindi.
These are:1.
V1 stem+V2: maar Daalnaa (kill-put) ?kill?.2.
V1 inf-e+lagnaa: rone lagnaa (cry-feel) ?startcrying?.3.
V1 inf+paRnaa: bolnaa paRaa (say-lie) ?say?.4.
V1 inf-e+V2: likhne ko/ke lie kahaa ?asked towrite?.5.
V1?kar+V2: lekar gayaa ?took and went?.2.1 Identification of CPs]Following Butt (1993) and Paul (2004), we usethe following diagnostic tests to identify CPs inHindi:1.
Scope of adverbs2.
Scope of negation3.
Nominalization4.
Passivization5.
Causativization6.
Movement(see Appendix A for an example of these tests)The tests above have been exhaustively appliedto varied data.
The results of these tests showthat some V+V sequences function as single se-mantic units and others do not.
They also showthat the V1stem+V2, V1inf-e+lagnaa andV1inf+paRnaa sequences show similar proper-ties and the V1 inf-e+V2 stem and the V1?kar+V2 behave similarly.
We call these Group 1and Group 2 respectively.Group 1 sequences are true CPs in Hindi.
TheV+V sequences are simple predicates (mono-clausal) with one subject.
Group 2 constructionsare not CPs.
They show clausal embedding andeach verb behaves as if it were an independentsyntactic entity.
In the next section we summa-rize the semantic properties of CPs (Group 1).2.2 Semantic Properties of V2 in Group 1After identifying the CPs from among differentV+V sequences, the next step was to determinehow they are formed.
To accomplish this we ex-amined the semantic properties of the secondverbs (V2) in Group 1:(1) V1inf+paRnaa:Examples include karnaa paRaa ?do-lie (had todo)?, bolnaa paRaa ?say-lie (had to say)?
etc.
Thesecond verb is always paRnaa ?to lie (lay)?.
Itappears in its stem form and bears all the inflec-tions.
As V2, paRnaa has the meaning of com-pulsion/force.
paRnaa ?lie?
as a V2 can be com-bined with any V1 irrespective of the latter?s se-mantic properties.
Since there are no syntactic orsemantic restrictions on the selection of V1, thisconstruction should be treated in the syntax as acombination of a V1 and a modal auxiliary.
(2) V1 inf-e+lagnaa:Examples include karne lagaa ?do-feel (start todo)?, bolne lagaa ?say-feel (start to say)?
etc.
TheV2 in this sequence is always lagnaa ?feel?
in thebare form and carries all the inflections.
The coremeaning of lagnaa ?feel?
is lost when it is com-bined with a V1.
As a V2 it always has the mean-ing of beginning, happening of an event.
lagnaa?feel?
as a V2 can be combined with any V1 irre-spective of the latter?s semantic properties.
Thus,this is also an instance of a modal auxiliary andshould be derived in the syntax.
(3) V1stem+V2In the formation of V1 stem+V2, the V2 may beany one of ten verbs, as shown in Figure 1.Figure 1: The 10 vector verbsAll these V2s also occur as main verbs.
As V2,the core meaning of these verbs is lost(bleached), but they acquire some new semanticproperties which are otherwise not seen (Abbi,1991, 1992; Gopalkrishnan and Abbi, 1992).
Thesemantic properties of V2s include finality, defi-niteness, negative value, manner of the action,attitude of the speaker etc.The combination of V1 and V2 is subject tothe semantic compatibility between the two verbs.1.
Daalnaa ?put?2.
lenaa ?take?3.
denaa ?give?4.
uThnaa ?wake?5.
jaanaa ?go?6.
paRnaa ?lie?7.
baiThnaa ?sit?8.
maarnaa ?kill?9.
dhamaknaa ?throb?10.
girnaa ?fall?28The argument structure of the CP is determinedby V1 as is the case-marking on the internal ar-guments, but the case-marking on the externalargument (subject) is determined by both verbs.From this analysis we conclude that V+VCPs are formed both lexically and syntacticallyin Hindi.
Detailed investigation shows us that theV2 in the V1inf-e+lagnaa and theV1inf+paRnaa constructions is a type of modalauxiliary and its semantic features are predictableand unvarying.
We propose to deal with theseverbs in the syntax and call these verbs syntacticcompound verbs (SCpdVs).
The V2 choice in theV1stem+V2 is not predictable and the CPs func-tion as a single complex of syntactic and seman-tic features.
We call these verbs lexical com-pound verbs (LCpdVs) and we propose to in-clude them in the lexical knowledge base.
In thenext section we provide a heuristic for automaticextraction of LCpdVs for storage in the lexicon.2.3 The Extraction ProcessBy scanning the corpus, V1stem+V2 sequenceswere found given the heuristic H* specified inFigure 2.Figure 2: Main heuristic for identifying LCpdVsTen native speakers of Hindi were consulted.They were asked to construct sentences with theextracted sequences.
If they were able to do so,that sequence was registered as a true LCpdV.The precision of the heuristic is calculated asthe ratio of the actual LCpdVs arrived at throughmanual validation to the total number of antici-pated LCpdVs identified by the heuristic.The results of these calculations are shown inTable 1, with a precision rate of 70% for theBBC corpus and 79%  for the CIIL one.Cor-pusTo-talde-tec-tionsPOSambigui-tiesPas-siveformsLCpdVs(manu-allyde-tected)PrecisionBBC 40 8 4 28 0.7(28/40)CIIL 174 32 7 135 0.79(135/174)Table 1: Precision of LCpdV extractionThe loss in precision was caused by (i) part ofspeech ambiguity, (ii) passivisation and (iii)idiomatic usages.
For lack of space, we do notdiscuss this here.When measures were taken to remedy theseerrors, we reached an accuracy of close to 98%(see table 2).BBC CIILConfirmed LCpdVs(A)423 953Not LCpdVs (B) 13 12Different POS (C) 65 179Possible LCpdVs butcontexts insufficient(D)44 36Minimum Precision(A/(A+B+D))0.88(423/480)0.95(953/1001)Maximum Precision((A+B)/(A+B+D))0.97(467/480)0.99(989/1001)Total V1stem+V2constructions in thecorpus10,145 36,115Table 2: Final results of LCpdV extractionA partial list of LCpdVs extracted from a test runon the CIIL corpus is presented in Table 3.baandhdenaa?tie?Karlenaa?do?Bhardenaa?fill?le jaanaa?take?Banaadenaa?make?jaanlenaa?know?kaaTdenaa?cut?Kar de-naa ?do?Badaljaanaa?change?Bhuuljaanaa?forget?jalaadenaa?burn?Girjaanaa?fall?Samajhlenaa?under-stand?Samjhaadenaa?makeunder-stand?Khodlenaa?dig?lauTaadenaa?return?Rahjaanaa?stay?Le lenaa?take?De denaa?give?ghusaadenaa?enter?Table 3: Examples of LCpdV extraction3 Conclusions and Future WorkIn this paper, we have presented a study of Hindicompound verbs, proposed diagnostic tests fortheir detection and given automatic methods fortheir extraction from a corpus.
Native speakers(Heuristic H*)If a verb V1 is in the stem form andis followed by a verb V2 from a  pre-stored list of verbs that can form thesecond component of the CP (section2.2, Figure 3), i.e., the ?vector?, thenthis verb along with the V2 is takento be an instance of an LCpdV.29verify that the accuracy of our method is close to98% on representative corpora.Future work will consist in inserting the ex-tracted LCpdVs into lexical resources such as theHindi wordnet2 at the right places with the rightlinks.ReferencesAbbi, Anvita.
