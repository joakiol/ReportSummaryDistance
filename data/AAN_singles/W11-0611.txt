Yet,there is no comprehensive resource that cap-tures concept?colour associations.
We presenta method to create a large word?colour as-sociation lexicon by crowdsourcing.
We fo-cus especially on abstract concepts and emo-tions to show that even though they cannot bephysically visualized, they too tend to havestrong colour associations.
Finally, we showhow word?colour associations manifest them-selves in language, and quantify usefulness ofco-occurrence and polarity cues in automati-cally detecting colour associations.11 IntroductionColour is a vital component in the successful deliv-ery of information, whether it is in marketing a com-mercial product (Sable and Akcay, 2010), design-ing webpages (Meier, 1988; Pribadi et al, 1990), orvisualizing information (Christ, 1975; Card et al,1999).
Since real-world concepts have associationswith certain colour categories (for example, dangerwith red, and softness with pink), complimentinglinguistic and non-linguistic information with appro-priate colours has a number of benefits, including:1This paper is an extended, non-archival, version of the shortpaper?Mohammad (2011).
It provides additional details on theanalysis of crowdsourced data, and experiments on the manifes-tations of word?colour associations in WordNet and in text.
Italso proposes a polarity-based automatic method.
(1) strengthening the message (improving semanticcoherence), (2) easing cognitive load on the receiver,(3) conveying the message quickly, and (4) evokingthe desired emotional response.
Consider, for exam-ple, the use of red in stop signs.
Drivers are ableto recognize the sign faster, and it evokes a sublim-inal emotion pertaining to danger, which is entirelyappropriate in the context.
The use of red to showareas of high crime rate in a visualization is anotherexample of good use of colour to draw emotional re-sponse.
On the other hand, improper use of colourcan be more detrimental to understanding than usingno colour (Marcus, 1982; Meier, 1988).Most languages have expressions involvingcolour, and many of these express sentiment.
Exam-ples in English include: green with envy, blue blood(an aristocrat), greener pastures (better avenues),yellow-bellied (cowardly), red carpet (special treat-ment), and looking through rose-tinted glasses (be-ing optimistic).
Further, new expressions are con-tinually coined, for example, grey with uncertaintyfrom Bianca Marsden?s poem Confusion.2 Thus,knowledge of concept?colour associations may alsobe useful for automatic natural language systemssuch as textual entailment, paraphrasing, machinetranslation, and sentiment analysis.A word has strong association with a colour whenthe colour is a salient feature of the concept theword refers to, or because the word is related toa such a concept.
Many concept?colour associa-tions, such as swan with white and vegetables withgreen, involve physical entities.
However, even ab-stract notions and emotions may have colour as-2http://www.biancaday.com/confusion.html97sociations (honesty?white, danger?red, joy?yellow,anger?red).
Further, many associations are culture-specific (Gage, 1969; Chen, 2005).
For example,prosperity is associated with red in much of Asia.Unfortunately, there exists no lexicon with anysignificant coverage that captures concept?colourassociations, and a number of questions remainunanswered, such as, the extent to which humansagree on these associations, and whether physicalconcepts are more likely to have a colour associationthan abstract ones.
We expect that the word?colourassociations manifest themselves as co-occurrencesin text and speech, but there have been no studies toshow the extent to which words co-occur more withassociated colours than with other colours.In this paper, we describe how we created a largeword?colour association lexicon by crowdsourcingwith effective quality control measures (Section 3).We used a word-choice question to guide the anno-tators toward the desired senses of the target words,and also to determine if the annotators know themeanings of the words.We conducted several experiments to measure theconsensus in word?colour associations, and howthese associations manifest themselves in language.Specifically, we show that:?
More than 30% of terms have a strong colourassociation (Sections 4).?
About 33% of thesaurus categories have strongcolour associations (Section 5).?
Abstract terms have colour associations almostas often as physical entities do (Section 6).?
There is a strong association of emotions andpolarities with colours (Section 7).?
Word-colour association manifests itself ascloseness in WordNet (to a smaller extent), andas high co-occurrence in text (to a greater ex-tent) (Section 8).Finally, we present an automatic method to de-termine word?colour association that relies on co-occurrence and polarity cues, but no labeled infor-mation of word?colour associations.
It obtains anaccuracy of more than 60%.
Comparatively, therandom choice and most-frequent class supervisedbaselines obtain only 9.1% and 33.3%, respectively.Such approaches can be used to for creating similarlexicons in other languages.2 Related WorkThe relation between language and cognition has re-ceived considerable attention over the years, mainlyon answering whether language impacts thought,and if so, to what extent.
Experiments withcolour categories have been used both to showthat language has an effect on thought (Brown andLenneberg, 1954; Ratner, 1989) and that it does not(Bornstein, 1985).
However, that line of work doesnot explicitly deal with word?colour associations.
Infact, we did not find any other academic work thatgathered large word?colour associations.
There is,however, a commercial endeavor?Cymbolism3.Child et al (1968), Ou et al (2011), and othersshow that people of different ages and genders havedifferent colour preferences.
(See also the onlinestudy by Joe Hallock4.)
In this work, we are inter-ested in identifying words that have a strong associa-tion with a colour due to their meaning; associationsthat are not affected by age and gender preferences.There is substantial work on inferring the emo-tions evoked by colour (Luscher, 1969; Xin et al,2004; Kaya, 2004).
Strapparava and Ozbal (2010)compute corpus-based semantic similarity betweenemotions and colours.
We combine the word?colourand word?emotion association lexicons to determinethe correlation between emotion-associated wordsand colours.Berlin and Kay (1969), and later Kay and Maffi(1999), showed that often colour terms appeared inlanguages in certain groups.
If a language has onlytwo colour terms, then they are white and black.
If alanguage has three colour terms, then they are white,black, and red.
If a language has four colour terms,then they are white, black, red, and green, and soon up to eleven colours.
From these groupings, thecolours can be ranked as follows:1. white, 2. black, 3. red, 4. green, 5. yel-low, 6. blue, 7. brown, 8. pink, 9. purple,10.
orange, 11. grey (1)We will refer to the above ranking as the Berlin andKay (B&K) order.
There are hundreds of differ-ent words for colours.5 To make our task feasible,3http://www.cymbolism.com/about4http://www.joehallock.com/edu/COM498/preferences.html5See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of colors98we needed to choose a relatively small list of basiccolours.
We chose to use the eleven basic colourwords of Berlin and Kay (1969).The MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart,1981) has, among other information, the imageabil-ity ratings for 9240 words.6 The imageability rat-ing is a score given by human judges that reflectshow easy it is to visualize the concept.
It is a scalefrom 100 (very hard to visualize) to 700 (very easyto visualize).
We use the ratings in our experimentsto determine whether there is a correlation betweenimageability and strength of colour association.3 CrowdsourcingAmazon?s Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an onlinecrowdsourcing platform that is especially well suitedfor tasks that can be done over the Internet througha computer or a mobile device.7 It is already beingused to obtain human annotation on various linguis-tic tasks (Snow et al, 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009).However, one must define the task carefully to ob-tain annotations of high quality.
Several checks mustbe placed to ensure that random and erroneous anno-tations are discouraged, rejected, and re-annotated.We used Mechanical Turk to obtain word?colourassociation annotations on a large-scale.
Each taskis broken into small independently solvable unitscalled HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) and up-loaded on the Mechanical Turk website.
The peo-ple who provide responses to these HITs are calledTurkers.
The annotation provided by a Turker for aHIT is called an assignment.We used the Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard,1986) as the source for terms to be annotated.
The-sauri, such as the Roget?s and Macquarie, grouprelated words into categories.
The Macquarie hasabout a thousand categories, each having about ahundred or so related terms.
Each category has ahead word that best represents the words in it.
Thecategories can be thought of as coarse senses or con-cepts (Yarowsky, 1992).
If a word is ambiguous,then it is listed in more than one category.
Sincea word may have different colour associations whenused in different senses, we obtained annotations atword-sense level.
We chose to annotate words that6http://www.psy.uwa.edu.au/mrcdatabase/uwa mrc.htm7Mechanical Turk: www.mturk.comhad one to five senses in the Macquarie Thesaurusand occurred frequently in the Google N-gram Cor-pus.
We annotated more than 10,000 of these word?sense pairs by creating HITs as described below.Each HIT has a set of questions, all of which areto be answered by the same person.
We requestedannotations from five different Turkers for each HIT.
(A Turker cannot attempt multiple assignments forthe same term.)
A complete HIT is shown below:Q1.
Which word is closest in meaning to sleep??
car ?
tree ?
nap ?
oliveQ2.
What colour is associated with sleep??
black?
blue?
brown?
green?
grey?
orange?
purple?
pink?
red?
white?
yellowQ1 is a word-choice question generated automati-cally by taking a near-synonym from the thesaurusand random distractors.
The near-synonym alsoguides the annotator to the desired sense of the word.Further, it encourages the annotator to think clearlyabout the target word?s meaning; we believe this im-proves the quality of the annotations in Q2.
If a wordhas multiple senses, that is, it is listed in more thanone thesaurus category, then separate questionnairesare generated for each sense.
Thus we obtain colourassociations at a word-sense level.If an annotator answers Q1 incorrectly, then wediscard information obtained from both Q1 and Q2.Thus, even though we do not have correct answersto Q2, likely incorrect annotations are filtered out.About 10% of the annotations were discarded be-cause of an incorrect answer to Q1.
Terms with lessthan three valid annotations were removed from fur-ther analysis.
Each of the remaining terms had, onaverage, 4.45 distinct annotations.The colour options in Q2 were presented in ran-dom order.
Observe that we do not provide a ?notassociated with any colour?
option.
This encouragescolour selection even if the annotator felt the associ-ation was weak.
If there is no association betweena word and a colour, then we expect low agreementamongst the annotators.

Each entry contains aunique word?synonym pair (from Q1), majority-voted colour, and a confidence score?number ofvotes for the colour / number of total votes.
(For theanalyses in the rest of the paper, ties were brokenby picking one colour at random.)
A separate ver-sion of the lexicon that includes entries for all of thevalid annotations by each of the annotators is alsoavailable.8The first row, overall, in Table 1 shows the per-centage of times different colours were associatedwith the target term.
The second row, voted, showspercentages after taking a majority vote from multi-ple annotators.
Observe that even though the colouroptions were presented in random order, the order ofthe most frequently associated colours is identical tothe Berlin and Kay order (Section 2:(1)).Table 2 shows how often the size of the majorityclass in colour associations is one, two, three, four,and five.
Since the annotators were given elevencolour options to choose from, if we assume inde-pendence, then the chance that none of the five an-notators agrees with each other (majority class sizeof one) is 1?10/11?9/11?8/11?7/11 = 0.344.Thus, if there was no correlation among any of theterms and colours, then 34.4% of the time none ofthe annotators would have agreed.
However, thishappens only 15.1% of the time.
A large numberof terms have a majority class size ?

Words are associated with colours to differ-ent degrees.
Some words may be associatedwith more than one colour in comparable de-grees, and there might be higher disagreementfor such instances.?
The target word is presented out of context.
Weexpect higher agreement if we provided wordsin particular contexts, but words can occur ininnumerable contexts, and annotating too manyinstances of the same word is costly.Nonetheless, the term?colour association lexiconis useful for downstream applications because anyof the following strategies may be employed: (1)choosing colour associations from only those in-stances with high agreement, (2) assuming low-agreement terms have no colour association, (3) de-termining colour association of a category throughinformation from many words, as described in thenext section.5 Category?Colour AssociationWords within a thesaurus category may not bestrongly associated with any colour, or they mayeach be associated with many different colours.We now describe experiments to determine whetherthere exist categories where the semantic coherencecarries over to a strong common association withone colour.We determine the strength of colour associationof a category by first determining the colour c mostassociated with the terms in it, and then calculatingthe ratio of the number of times a word from the cat-egory is associated with c to the number of words inthe category associated with any colour.
Only cate-100Figure 1: Scatter plot of thesaurus categories.

Some points are labeled.gories that had at least four words that also appearin the word?colour lexicon were considered; 535 ofthe 812 categories from Macquarie Thesaurus metthis condition.If a category has exactly four words that appear inthe colour lexicon, and if all four words are associ-ated with different colours, then the category has thelowest possible strength of colour association?0.25(1/4).
19 categories had a score of 0.25.
No categoryhad a score less than 0.25.
Any score above 0.25shows more than random chance association witha colour.
There were 516 such categories (96.5%).177 categories (33.1%) had a score 0.5 or above, thatis, half or more of the words in these categories areassociated with one colour.
We consider these tobe strong associations, and a gold standard for au-tomatic measures of association.6 Imageability and Colour AssociationIt is natural for physical entities of a certain colourto be associated with that colour.
However, abstractconcepts such as danger and excitability are also as-sociated with colours?red and orange, respectively.Figure 1 displays an experiment to determinewhether there is a correlation between imageabilityand association with colour.We define imageability of a thesaurus category tobe the average of the imageability ratings of wordsin it.
We calculated imageability for the 535 cate-gories described in the previous section using onlythe words that appear in the colour lexicon.
Figure 1shows the scatter plot of these categories on the im-ageability and strength of colour association axes.The colour association was calculated as describedin the previous section.If higher imageability correlated with greater ten-dency to have a colour association, then we wouldsee most of the points along the diagonal movingup from left to right.
Instead, we observe that thestrongly associated categories (points in the shadedregion) are spread across the imageability axis, im-plying that there is only weak, if any, correlation be-tween imageability and strength of association withcolour.
Imageability and colour association have aPearson?s product moment correlation of 0.116, anda Spearman rank order correlation of 0.102.7 The Colour of Emotion WordsEmotions such as joy and anger are abstract conceptsdealing with one?s psychological state.
Mohammadand Turney (2010) created a crowdsourced term?emotion association lexicon consisting of associa-tions of over 10,000 word-sense pairs with eightemotions?joy, sadness, anger, fear, trust, disgust,surprise, and anticipation?argued to be the basicand prototypical emotions (Plutchik, 1980).
Wecombine their term?emotion association lexicon andour term?colour lexicon to determine the colour sig-nature of different emotions?the rows in Table 3.The top two most frequently associated colours witheach of the eight emotions are shown in bold.

The highest values in each column are shown in bold.anger terms associated with different colours.We see that all of the emotions have strong associ-ations with certain colours.
Observe that anger is as-sociated most with red.
Other negative emotions?disgust, fear, sadness?go strongest with black.Among the positive emotions: anticipation is mostfrequently associated with white and green; joy withwhite, green, and yellow; and trust with white, blue,and green.
Thus, colour can add to the emotionalpotency of visualizations.The Mohammad and Turney (2010) lexicon alsohas associations with positive and negative polar-ity.
We combine these term?polarity associationswith term?colour associations to show the coloursignature for positive and negative terms?the rowsof Table 4.
We observe that some colours tendto, more often than not, have strong positive asso-ciations (white, green, yellow, blue, pink, and or-ange), whereas others have strong negative associa-tions (black, red, brown, and grey).8 Manifestation of Concept?ColourAssociation in WordNet and in Text8.1 Closeness in WordNetColour terms are listed in WordNet, and interest-ingly, they are fairly ambiguous.
Therefore, theycan be found in many different synsets (see Table5).
A casual examination of WordNet reveals thatsome synsets (or concepts) are close to their associ-ated colour?s synset.
For example, darkness is a hy-pernym of black and inflammation is one hop awayfrom red.
It is plausible that if a concept is stronglyassociated with a certain colour, then such concept?colour pairs will be close to each other in a seman-tic network such as WordNet.
If so, the semanticcloseness of a word with each of the eleven basiccolours in WordNet can be used to automatically de-termine the colour most associated with the 177 the-saurus categories from the gold standard describedin Section 5 earlier.
We determine closeness usingtwo similarity measures?Jiang and Conrath (1997)and Lin (1997)?and two relatedness measures?Lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) and gloss vec-tor overlap (Pedersen et al, 2004)?from the Word-Net Similarity package.For each thesaurus category?colour pair, wesummed the WordNet closeness of each of the termsin the category to the colour.
The colour with thehighest sum is chosen as the one closest to the the-saurus category.
Section (c) and section (d) of Ta-ble 8.2, show how often the closest colours are alsothe colours most associated with the gold standardcategories.
Section (a) lists some unsupervised base-lines.
Random-choice baseline is the score obtainedwhen a colour is chosen at random (1/11 = 9.1%).Another baseline is a system that always chooses themost frequent colour in a corpus.
Section (a) reportsthree such baseline scores obtained by choosing themost frequently occurring colour in three separatecorpora.
Section (b) lists a supervised baseline ob-tained by choosing the colour most commonly asso-102colour white black red green yellow blue brown pink purple orange grey# of senses 25 22 7 14 8 16 8 7 7 6 13Table 5: The number of senses of colour terms in WordNet.white black red green yellow blue brown pink purple orange grey ?B&K rank: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11BNC freq: 1480 3460 2070 1990 270 1430 1170 450 180 360 800rank: 4 1 2 3 10 5 6 8 11 9 7 0.727GNC freq: 205 239 138 106 80 123 63 41 16 36 18rank: 2 1 3 5 6 4 7 8 11 9 10 0.884GBC freq: 233 188 130 86 44 75 72 14 11 19 22rank: 1 2 3 4 7 5 6 9 10 11 8 0.918Table 6: Frequency and ranking of colour terms per 1,000,000 words in the British National Corpus (BNC), GoogleN-gram Corpus (GNC), and Google Books Corpus (GBC).

Theautomatic measures listed in sections (c) through (f)do not have access to this information.Observe that the relatedness measures aremarkedly better than the similarity measures at iden-tifying the true associated colour.
Yet, for a major-ity of the thesaurus categories the closest colour inWordNet is not the most associated colour.8.2 Co-occurrence in TextPhysical entities that tend to have a certain colourtend to be associated with that colour.
For exampleleaves are associated with green.
Intuition suggeststhat these entities will co-occur with the associatedcolours more often than with any other colour.
Aslanguage has expressions such as green with envyand feeling blue, we also expect that certain abstractnotions, such as envy and sadness, will co-occurmore often with their associated colours, green andblue respectively, more often than with any othercolour.
We now describe experiments to determinethe extent to which target concepts co-occur in textmost often with their associated colours.We selected three corpora to investigate occur-rences of colour terms: the British National Corpus(BNC) (Burnard, 2000), the Google N-gram Cor-pus (GNC), and the Google Books Corpus (GBC)(Michel et al, 2011).9 The BNC, a 100 millionword corpus, is considered to be fairly balanced with9The BNC is available at: http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk.The GNC is available through the Linguistic Data Consortium.The GBC is available at http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/datasets.text from various domains.
The GNC is a trillion-word web coprus.
The GBC is a digitized versionof about 5.2 million books, and the English portionhas about 361 billion words.
The GNC and GBC aredistributed as collections of 1-gram to 5-gram files.Table 6 shows the frequencies and ranks of theeleven basic colour terms in the BNC and the uni-gram files of GNC and GBC.
The ranking is from themost frequent to the least frequent colour in the cor-pus.
The last column lists the Spearman rank ordercorrelation (?)
of the rankings with the Berlin andKay ranks (1969) (listed in Section 2:(1)).
Observethat order of the colours from most frequent to leastfrequent in the GNC and GBC have a strong corre-lation with the order proposed by Berlin and Kay,especially so for the rankings obtained from countsin the Google Books Corpus.For each of the 177 gold standard thesaurus cate-gories, we determined the conditional probability ofco-occurring with different colour terms in the BNC,GNC, and GBC.
The total co-occurrence frequencyof a category with a colour was calculated by sum-ming up the co-occurrence frequency of each of theterms in it with the colour term.
We used a four-word window as context.
The counts from GNC andGBC were determined using the fivegram files.
Sec-tion (e) in Table 8.2 shows how often the colour withthe highest conditional probability is also the colourmost associated with a category.
These numbers arehigher than the baselines (a and b), as well as thescores obtained by the WordNet approaches (c).From Table 5 in Section 7, we know that some103Automatic method for choosing colour Accuracy(a) Unsupervised baselines:- randomly choosing a colour 9.1- most frequent colour in BNC (black) 23.2- most frequent colour in GNC (black) 23.2- most frequent colour in GBC (white) 33.3(b) Supervised baseline:- colour most often associatedwith categories (white) 33.3(c) WordNet similarity measures:- Jiang Conrath measure 15.7- Lin?s measure 15.7(d) WordNet relatedness measures:- Lesk measure 24.7- gloss vector measure 28.6(e) Co-occurrence in text:- p(colour|word) in BNC 31.4- p(colour|word) in GNC 37.9- p(colour|word) in GBC 38.3(f) Co-occurrence and polarity:- p(colour|word, polarity) in BNC 51.4- p(colour|word, polarity) in GNC 47.6- p(colour|word, polarity) in GBC 60.1Table 7: Percentage of times the colour chosen by auto-matic method is also the colour identified by annotatorsas most associated to a thesaurus category.colours tend to be strongly positive and others neg-ative.
We wanted to determine how useful these po-larity cues can be in identifying the colour most as-sociated with a category.
We used the automaticallygenerated Macquarie Semantic Orientation Lexicon(MSOL) (Mohammad et al, 2009) to determine if athesaurus category is positive or negative.10 A cat-egory is marked as negative if it has more negativewords than positive, otherwise it is marked as pos-itive.
If a category is positive, then co-occurrencecues were used to select a colour from only thepositive colours (white, green, yellow, blue, pink,and orange), whereas if a category is negative, thenco-occurrence cues select from only the negativecolours (black, red, brown, and grey).
Section (f) ofTable 8.2 provides results with this method.
Observethat these numbers are a marked improvement overSection (e) numbers, suggesting that polarity cuescan be very useful in determining concept?colourassociation.10MSOL is available at http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/?saif/WebPages/ResearchInterests.html#semanticorientation.Counts from the GNC yielded poorer results com-pared to the much smaller BNC, and the somewhatsmaller GBC possibly because frequency countsfrom GNC are available only for those n-grams thatoccur at least thirty times.
Further, GBC and BNCare both collections of edited texts, and so expectedto be cleaner than the GNC which is a corpus ex-tracted from the World Wide Web.9 Conclusions and Future WorkWe created a large word?colour association lexi-con by crowdsourcing, which we will make pub-licly available.
Word-choice questions were used toguide the annotators to the desired senses of the tar-get words, and also as a gold questions for identi-fying malicious annotators (a common problem incrowdsourcing).
We found that more than 32% ofthe words and 33% of the Macquarie Thesaurus cat-egories have a strong association with one of theeleven colours chosen for the experiment.
We an-alyzed abstract concepts, emotions in particular, andshowed that they too have strong colour associa-tions.
Thus, using the right colours in tasks suchas information visualization and web development,can not only improve semantic coherence but alsoinspire the desired emotional response.Interestingly, we found that frequencies of colourassociations follow the same order in which colourterms occur in different languages (Berlin and Kay,1969).
The frequency-based ranking of colour termsin the BNC, GNC, and GBC also had a high correla-tion with the Berlin and Kay order.Finally, we show that automatic methods that relyon co-occurrence and polarity cues alone, and no la-beled information of word?colour association, canaccurately estimate the colour associated with a con-cept more than 60% of the time.
The random choiceand supervised baselines for this task are 9.1% and33.3%, respectively.
We are interested in usingword?colour associations as a feature in sentimentanalysis and for paraphrasing.AcknowledgmentsThis research was funded by the National ResearchCouncil Canada.
