We present aprototype system called PROFILE whichuses a client-server architecture to ex-tract noun-phrase descriptions of enti-ties such as people, places, and organiza-tions.
The system serves two purposes:as an information extraction tool, it al-lows users to search for textual descrip-tions of entities; as a utility to generatefunctional descriptions (FD), it is used ina functional-unification based generationsystem.
We present an evaluation of theapproach and its applications to naturallanguage generation and summarization.1 I n t roduct ionIn our work to date on news summarization atColumbia University (McKeown and Radev, 1995;Radev, 1996), information is extracted from a se-ries of input news articles (MUC, 1992; Grishmanet al, 1992) and is analyzed by a generation com-ponent o produce a summary that shows how per-ception of the event has changed over time.
In thissummarization paradigm, problems arise when in-formation needed for the summary is either miss-ing from the input article(s) or not extracted bythe information extraction system.
In such cases,the information may be readily available in othercurrent news stories, in past news, or in onlinedatabases.
If  the summarization system can findthe needed information in other online sources,then it can produce an improved summary bymerging information from multiple sources withinformation extracted from the input articles.In the news domain, a summary needs to referto people, places, and organizations and providedescriptions that clearly identify the entity for thereader.
Such descriptions may not be present inthe original text that is being summarized.
For ex-ample, the American pilot Scott O'Grady, downedin Bosnia in June of 1995, was unheard of by theAmerican public prior to the incident.
If a readertuned into news on this event days later, descrip-tions from the initial articles may be more useful.A summarizer that has access to different descrip-tions will be able to select he description that bestsuits both the reader and the series of articles be-ing summarized.In this paper, we describe a system calledPROFILE that tracks prior references to a givenentity by extracting descriptions for later use insummarization.
In contrast with previous work oninformation extraction, our work has the followingfeatures:?
It builds a database of profiles for entities bystoring descriptions from a collected corpus of?
past news.?
It operates in real time, allowing for connec-tions with the latest breaking, online news toextract information about the most recentlymentioned individuals and organizations.?
It collects and merges information from dis-tributed sources thus allowing for a more com-plete record of information.?
As it parses and identifies descriptions, itbuilds a lexicalized, syntactic representationof the description in a form suitable for in-put to the FUF/SURGE language generationsystem (Elhadad, 1993; Robin, 1994).The result is a system that can combine de-scriptions from articles appearing only a few min-utes before the ones being summarized with de-scriptions from past news in a permanent recordfor future use.
Its utility lies in its potential forrepresenting entities, present in one article, withdescriptions found in other articles, possibly com-ing from another source.Since the system constructs a lexicalized, syn-tactic functional description (FD) from the ex-tracted description, the generator can re-use thedescription in new contexts, merging it with other221descriptions, into a new grammatical sentence.This would not be possible if only canned stringswere used, with no information about their inter-nal structure.
Thus, in addition to collecting aknowledge source which provides identifying fea-tures of individuals, PROFILE also provides a lex-icon of domain appropriate phrases that can be in-tegrated with individual words from a generator'slexicon to flexibly produce summary wording.We have extended the system by semanticallycategorizing descriptions using WordNet (Miller etal., 1990), so that a generator can more easily de-termine which description is relevant in differentcontexts.PROFILE  can also be used in a real-time fash-ion to monitor entities and the changes of descrip-tions associated with them over the course of time.In the following sections, we first overview re-lated work in the area of information extraction.We then turn to a discussion of the system com-ponents which build the profile database, followedby a description of how the results are used in gen-eration.
We close with our current directions, de-scribing what parameters can influence a strategyfor generating a sequence of anaphoric referencesto the same entity over time.2 Re la ted  WorkResearch related to ours falls into two main cate-gories: extraction of information from input textand construction of knowledge sources for genera-tion.cal context surrounding the hypothesized propernouns (McDonald, 1993; Coates-Stephens, 1991)and the larger discourse context (Mani et al, 1993)to improve the accuracy of proper noun extrac-tion when large known word lists are not available.Like this research, our work also aims at extract-ing proper nouns without the aid of large wordlists.
We use a regular grammar encoding part-of-speech categories to extract certain text patternsand we use WordNet (Miller et al, 1990) to pro-vide semantic filtering.Our work on extracting descriptions is quitesimilar to the work carried out under the DARPAmessage understanding program for extracting de-scriptions (MUC, 1992).
The purpose for and the?
scenario in which description extraction is done isquite different, but the techniques are very simi-lar.
It is based on the paradigm of representingpatterns that express the kinds of descriptions weexpect; unlike previous work we do not encode se-mantic categories in the patterns ince we want tocapture all descriptions regardless of domain.Research on a system called Murax (Kupiec,1993) is similar to ours from a different perspec-tive.
Murax also extracts information from a textto serve directly in response to a user question.l~urax uses lexico-syntactic patterns, collocationalanalysis, along with information retrieval statis-tics, to find the string of words in a text that ismost likely to serve as an answer to a user's wh-query.
In our work, the string that is extractedmay be merged, or regenerated, as part of a largertextual summary.2.1 In fo rmat ion  Ext rac t ionWork on information extraction is quite broad andcovers far more topics and problems than the in-formation extraction problem we address.
Werestrict our comparison here to work on propernoun extraction, extraction of people descriptionsin various information extraction systems devel-oped for the message understanding conferences(MUC, 1992), and use of extracted informationfor question answering.Techniques for proper noun extraction includethe use of regular grammars to delimit and iden-tify proper nouns (Mani et al, 1993; Paik et al,1994), the use of extensive name lists, place names,titles and "gazetteers" in conjunction with par-tial grammars in order to recognize proper nounsas unknown words in close proximity to knownwords (Cowie et al, 1992; Aberdeen et al, 1992),statistical training to learn, for example, Spanishnames, from online corpora (Ayuso et al, 1992),and the use of concept based pattern matchersthat use semantic oncepts as pattern categoriesas well as part-of-speech information (Weischedelet al, 1993; Lehnert et al, 1993).
In addition,some researchers have explored the use of both lo-2.2 Const ruct ion  of  Knowledge  Sourcesfor  Generat ionThe construction of a database of phrases for re-use in generation is quite novel.
Previous workon extraction of collocations for use in genera-tion (Smadja and McKeown, 1991) is related inthat full phrases are extracted and syntacticallytyped so that they can be merged with individualwords in a generation lexicon to produce a full sen-tence.
However, extracted collocations were usedonly to determine realization of an input concept.In our work, stored phrases would be used to pro-vide content that can identify a person or placefor a reader, in addition to providing the actualphrasing.3 Creat ion  o f  a Database  o fP ro f i lesFigure 1 shows the overall architecture of PRO-FILE and the two interfaces to it (a user interfaceon the World-Wide Web and an interface to a nat-ural language generation system).
In this section,we describe the extraction component of PRO-FILE, the following section focuses on the uses of222PROFILE for generation, and Section 7 describesthe Web-based interface.r .

s 1\[ Surface Generation IFigure 1: Overall Architecture of PROFILE.3.1 Ext rac t ion  of  ent i ty  names  f rom oldnewswi reTo seed the database with an initial set of descrip-tions, we used a 1.4 MB corpus containing Reutersnewswire from March to June of 1995.
The pur-pose of such an initial set of descriptions i twofold.First, it allows us to test the other components ofthe system.
Furthermore, at the time a descrip-tion is needed it limits the amount of online fulltext, Web search that must be done.
At this stage,search is limited to the database of retrieved de-scriptions only, thus reducing search time as noconnections will be made to external news sourcesat the time of the query.
Only when a suitablestored description cannot be found will the sys-tem initiate search of additional text.?
Ex t rac t ion  of  cand idates  for p ropernouns .
After tagging the corpus using thePOS part-of-speech tagger (Church, 1988),we used a CREP (Duford, 1993) regulargrammar to first extract all possible candi-dates for entities.
These consist of all se-quences of words that were tagged as propernouns (NP) by POS.
Our manual analysisshowed that out of a total of 2150 entitiesrecovered in this way, 1139 (52.9%) are notnames of entities.
Among these are n-gramssuch as "Prime Minister" or "Egyptian Pres-ident" which were tagged as NP by POS.
Ta-ble 1 shows how many entities we retrieveat this stage, and of them, how many passthe semantic filtering test.
The numbers inthe left-hand column refer to two-word nounphrases that identify entities (e.g., "Bill Clin-ton").
Counts for three-word noun phrasesare shown in the right-hand column.
We showcounts for multiple and unique occurrences ofthe same noun phrase.?
Weed ing  out  of  fa l se  cand idates .
Oursystem analyzed all candidates for entitynames using WordNet (Miller et al, 1990)and removed from consideration those thatcontain words appearing in WordNet's dictio-nary.
This resulted in a list of 421 uniqueentity names that we used for the automaticdescription extraction stage.
All 421 entitynames retrieved by the system are indeedproper nouns.3.2 Ext rac t ion  of  descr ip t ionsThere are two occasions on which we extract de-scriptions using finite-state techniques.
The firstcase is when the entity that we want to describewas already extracted automatically (see Subsec-tion 3.1) and exists in PROFILE's database.
Thesecond case is when we want a description to be re-trieved in real time based on a request from eithera Web user or the generation system.There exist many live sources of newswire onthe Internet hat can be used for this second case.Some that merit our attention are the ones thatcan be accessed remotely through small client pro-grams that don't require any sophisticated proto-cols to access the newswire articles.
Such sourcesinclude HTTP-accessible sites such as the Reuterssite at www.yahoo.com and CNN Interactive atwww.cnn.com, as well as others such as ClariNetwhich is propagated through the NNTP protocol.All these sources share a common characteristicin that they are all updated in real time and allcontain information about current events.
Hence,they are therefore likely to satisfy the criteria ofpertinence to our task, such as the likelihood of thesudden appearance of new entities that couldn'tpossibly have been included a priori in the gener-ation lexicon.Our system generates finite-state representa-tions of the entities that need to be described.
Anexample of a finite-state description of the entity"Yasser Arafat" is shown in Figure 2.
These fullexpressions are used as input to the descriptionfinding module which uses them to find candidatesentences in the corpus for finding descriptions.Since the need for a description may arise at alater time than when the entity was found andmay require searching new text, the descriptionfinder must first locate these expressions in thetext.These representations are fed to CREP whichextracts noun phrases on either side of the en-tity (either pre-modifiers or appositions) from thenews corpus.

Thus, they may range from a simplenoun (e.g., "president Bill Clinton") to a muchlonger expression (e.g., "Gilberto Rodriguez Ore-juela, the head of the Cali cocaine cartel").
Otherforms of descriptions, such as relative clauses, arethe focus of ongoing implementation.Table 2 shows some of the different patternsretrieved.3.3 Categor i za t ion  of  descr ip t ionsWe use WordNet to group extracted escriptionsinto categories.
For all words in the description,we try to find a WordNet hypernym that can re-strict the semantics of the description.
Currently,we identify concepts uch as "profession", "nation-ality", and "organization".
Each of these conceptsis triggered by one or more words (which we call"triggers") in the description.
Table 2 shows someexamples of descriptions and the concepts underwhich they are classified based on the WordNet hy-pernyms for some "trigger" words.
For example,all of the following "triggers" in the list "minister","head", "administrator", and "commissioner" canbe traced up to "leader" in the WordNet hierarchy.3.4 Organ izat ion  of  descr ip t ions  in adatabase of profilesFor each retrieved entity we create a new profilein a database of profiles.
We keep informationabout the surface string that is used to describethe entity in newswire (e.g., "Addis Ababa"),the source of the description and the date thatthe entry has been made in the database (e.g.,"reuters95_06_25").
In addition to these piecesof meta-information, all retrieved escriptions andtheir frequencies are also stored.Currently, our system doesn't have the capa-bility of matching references to the same entitythat use different wordings.
As a result, we keepseparate profiles for each of the following: "RobertDole", "Dole", and "Bob Dole".
We use each ofthese strings as the key in the database of descrip-tions.Figure 3 shows the profile associated with thekey "John Major".KEY: john majorSOURCE: reuters95~3-O6_.nwsDESCRIPTION: british prime ministerFREQUENCY: 75DESCRIPTION: prime ministerFREQUENCY: 58DESCRIPTION: a defiant british prime ministerFREQUENCY: 2DESCRIPTION: his british counterpartFREQUENCY: 1Figure 3: Profile for John Major.The database of profiles is updated every timea query retrieves new descriptions matching a cer-tain key.4 Generat ionWe have made an attempt to reuse the descrip-tions, retrieved by the system, in more than a triv-ial way.
The content planner of a language gener-ation system that needs to present an entity to theuser that he has not seen previously, might wantto include some background information about it.However, in case the extracted information doesn'tcontain a handy description, the system can usesome descriptions retrieved by PROFILE.4.1 T rans format ion  of  descriptions into~nct iona l  DescriptionsSince our major goal in extracting descriptionsfrom on-line corpora was to use them in gener-ation, we have written a utility which convertsfinite-state descriptions retrieved by PROFILEinto functional descriptions (FD) (Elhadad, 1991)that we can use directly in generation.
A descrip-tion retrieved by the system from the article in 4is shown in Figure 5.
The corresponding FD isshown in Figure 6.We have implemented a TCP/ IP  interface toSurge.
The FD generation component uses thisinterface to send a new FD to the surface realiza-tion component of Surge which generates an En-glish surface form corresponding to it.224ExampleAddis Ababa, the Ethiopian capitalSouth Africa's main black opposition leader, Mangosuthu ButheleziBoerge Ousland, 33maverick French ex-soceer boss Bernard TapieItaly's former prime minister, Silvio BerlusconiSinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican ArmyTrigger Termcapitalleader33bossministerarmSemant ic  CategorylocationoccupationageoccupationoccupationorganizationTable 2: Examples of retrieved escriptions.MILAN - A judge ordered Italy's former primeminister Silvio Berlusconi to stand trial in Jan-uary on corruption charges in a ruling that coulddestroy the media magnate's hope of returning tohigh office.Figure 4: Source article.Italy@NPNP 's@$ former@JJ prime@JJminister@NN Silvio@NPNP Berlusconi@NPNPFigure 5: Retrieved description for Silvio Berlus-coni.

Grammat ica l i ty .
The deeper representa-tion allows for grammatical transformations,such as aggregation: e.g., "president Yeltsin"+ "president Clinton" can be generated as"presidents Yeltsin and Clinton".?
Un i f i ca t ion  w i th  ex is t ing  onto logies .E.g., if an ontology contains informationabout the word "president" as being a realiza-tion of the concept "head of state", then un-der certain conditions, the description can bereplaced by one referring to "head of state".?
Generat ion  of  re fe r r ing  express ions .
Inthe previous example, if "president Bill Clin-ton" is used in a sentence, then "head ofstate" can be used as a referring expressionin a subsequent sentence.?
Enhancement  o f  descr ip t ions .
If we haveretrieved "prime minister" as a description forSilvio Berlusconi, and later we obtain knowl-edge that someone else has become Italy'sprimer minister, then we can generate "for-mer prime minister" using a transformationof the old FD.?
Lexica l  choice.
When different descrip-tions are automatically marked for semantics,PROFILE can prefer to generate one over an-other based on semantic features.
This isuseful if a summary discusses events relatedto one description associated with the entitymore than the others.?
Merg ing  lexicons.
The lexicon generatedautomatically by the system can be mergedwith a domain lexicon generated manually.These advantages look very promising and wewill be exploring them in detail in our work onsummarization i the near future.5 Coverage and L imi ta t ionsIn this section we provide an analysis of the capa-bilities and current limitations of PROFILE.5.1 CoverageAt the current stage of implementation, PROFILEhas the following coverage.?
Syntact i c  coverage.
Currently, the sys-tem includes an extensive finite-state gram-mar that can handle various pre-modifiersand appositions.
The grammar matches arbi-trary noun phrases in each of these two casesto the extent hat the POS part-of-speech tag-ger provides a correct tagging.?
P rec is ion .
In Subsection 3.1 we showed theprecision of the extraction of entity names.Similarly, we have computed the precision ofretrieved 611 descriptions using randomly se-lected entities from the list retrieved in Sub-section 3.1.
Of the 611 descriptions, 551(90.2%) were correct.
The others includeda roughly equal number of cases of incorrectNP attachment and incorrect part-of-speech225assignment.
For our task (symbolic text gen-eration), precision is more important than re-call; it is critical that the extracted escrip-tions are correct in order to be converted toFD and generated.?
Length  o f  descr ipt ions .
The longest de-scription retrieved by the system was 9 lexicalitems long: "Maurizio Gucci, the former headof Italy's Gucci fashion dynasty".
The short-est descriptions are 1 lexical item in length -e.g.
"President Bill Clinton".?
P ro toco l  coverage.
We have implementedretrieval facilities to extract descriptions us-ing the NNTP (Usenet News) and HTTP(World-Wide Web) protocols.5.2 L imi ta t ionsOur system currently doesn't handle entity cross-referencing.
It will not realize that "Clinton" and"Bill Clinton" refer to the same person.
Nor willit link a person's profile with the profile of theorganization of which he is a member.At this stage, the system generates functionaldescriptions (FD), but they are not being used ina summarization system yet.6 Cur rent  D i rec t ionsOne of the more important current goals is toincrease coverage of the system by providing in-terfaces to a large number of on-line sources ofnews.
We would ideally want to build a compre-hensive and shareable database of profiles that canbe queried over the World-Wide Web.We need to refine the algorithm to handle casesthat are currently problematic.
For example, pol-ysemy is not properly handled.
For instance, wewould not label properly noun phrases such as"Rice University", as it contains the word "rice"which can be categorized as a food.Another long-term goal of our research is thegeneration of evolving summaries that continu-ously update the user on a given topic of inter-est.
In that case, the system will have a modelcontaining all prior interaction with the user.
Toavoid repetitiveness, such a system will have to re-sort to using different descriptions (as well as refer-ring expressions) to address a specific entity 1.
Wewill be investigating an algorithm that will select aproper ordering of multiple descriptions referringto the same person.After we collect a series of descriptions for eachpossible entity, we need to decide how to select1Our corpus analysis supports this proposition -a large number of threads of summaries on the sametopic from the Reuters and UPI newswire used up to10 different referring expressions (mostly of the typeof descriptions discussed in this paper) to refer to thesame entity.among all of them.
There are two scenarios.
Inthe first one, we have to pick one single descrip-tion from the database which best fits the sum-mary that we are generating.
In the second sce-nario, the evolving summary, we have to generatea sequence of descriptions, which might possiblyview the entity from different perspectives.
Weare investigating algorithms that will decide theorder of generation of the different descriptions.Among the factors that will influence the selec-tion and ordering of descriptions, we can note theuser's interests, his knowledge of the entity, the fo-cus of the summary (e.g., "democratic presidentialcandidate" for Bill Clinton, vs. "U.S.  president").We can also select one description over anotherbased on how recent they have been included inthe database, whether or not one of them has beenused in a summary already, whether the summaryis an update to an earlier summary, and whetheranother description from the same category hasbeen used already.
We have yet to decide underwhat circumstances a description eeds to be gen-erated at all.We are interested in implementing existing al-gorithms or designing our own that will match dif-ferent instances of the same entity appearing indifferent syntactic forms - e.g., to establish that"PLO" is an alias for the "Palestine LiberationOrganization".
We will investigate using cooccur-rence information to match acronyms to full or-ganization ames and alternative spellings of thesame name with each other.An important application that we are consid-ering is applying the technology to text availableusing other protocols - such as SMTP (for elec-tronic mail) and retrieve descriptions for entitiesmentioned in such messages.We will also look into connecting the currentinterface with news available to the Internet withan existing search engine such as Lycos (www.-lycos.com) or AltaVista (www.altavista.digital.-corn).
We can then use the existing indices ofall Web documents mentioning a given entity asa news corpus on which to perform the extractionof descriptions.Finally, we will investigate the creation ofKQML (Finin et al, 1994) interfaces to the differ-ent components of PROFILE which will be linkedto other information access modules at ColumbiaUniversity.7 Cont r ibut ionsWe have described a system that allows users toretrieve descriptions of entities using a Web-basedsearch engine.
Figure 7 shows the Web interfaceto PROFILE.
Users can select an entity (such as"3ohn Major"), specify what semantic lasses ofdescriptions they want to retrieve (e.g., age, posi-226tion, nationality) as well as the maximal numberof queries that they want.
They can also specifywhich sources of news should be searched.
Cur-rently, the system has an interface to Reuters atwww.yahoo.com, The CNN Web site, and to alllocal news delivered via NNTP to our local newsdomain.PROFILEs,,,~ I~=,~.~ .~ !
'"Figure 7: Web-based interface to PROFILE.The Web-based interface is accessible publicly(currently within Columbia University only).
Allqueries are cached and the descriptions retrievedcan be reused in a subsequent query.
We believethat such an approach to information extractioncan be classified as a collaborative database.The FD generation component produces yn-tactically correct functional descriptions that canbe used to generate English-language d scriptionsusing FUF and Surge, and can also be used in ageneral-purpose summarization system in the do-main of current news.All components of the system assume no priordomain knowledge and are therefore portable tomany domains - such as sports, entertainment,and business.8 AcknowledgmentsThis work was partially supported by NSF grantGER-90-2406 and by a grant from Columbia Uni-versity's Strategic Initiative Fund sponsored bythe Provost's Office.Re ferencesJohn Aberdeen, John Burger, Dennis Connolly,Susan Roberts, and Marc Vilain.
