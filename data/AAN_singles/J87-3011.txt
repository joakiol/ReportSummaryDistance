THE FINITE STRING NEWSLETTERSITE REPORTLANGUAGE IN THE COMPUTER AGEA NOTE ON CURRENT ACTIVITIESIN COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS IN GERMANYDafydd G ibbonUmiversity of BielefeldA recent dramatic increase in activities in computa-tional linguistics in the German Federal Republicprompts this note.
In particular, considerable attentionhas been focused on the major event in this field duringthe last few years, the three-week SiC Summer School("Sprache im Computerzeitalter" - -  "Language in theComputer Age") organized in Munich in September1986 by the German Linguistics Society (DeutscheGesellschaft fuer Sprachwissenschaft, DGfS), and at-tended by 260 linguists, including students, facultymembers, and representatives of industrial research anddevelopment departments.A mark of the importance attributed to the field, andof the impact of this Summer School, is the inaugurationof a "Sektion Computerlinguistik" in the DGfS duringits Annual Meeting in March 1987, with the aim ofproviding an official German partner in computationallinguistics for internationally oriented research, underthe auspices of the official representative body forlinguistics in Germany.
This initiative was supported by37 eminent heoretical and computational linguists onthe staffs of German universities and industrial R&Ddepartments.
The Society considered the time to be ripefor such a step, which would provide official represen-tation in a linguistic context for researchers in compu-tational inguistic questions but working in other fields,such as applied linguistics (by the "Gesellschaft fuerAngewandte Linguistik"), phonetic speech signal proc-essing, or language data processing (in the "Gesells-chaff fuer linguistische Datenverarbeitung").A small amount of background information may helpto put these recent developments into perspective.
Adistinction will be made for this purpose between fourrelated fields, three of which were in focus at the SiCSummer School:1.
Computational linguistics (as a branch of theoret-ical linguistics);2.
Natural language processing in artificial intelli-gence contexts;3.
Linguistic data processing (as a source of tools fortext documentation and analysis in the human-ities);4.
Signal processing (analysis and synthesis) in pho-netics, with recently developed connections toproblems in phonological and prosodic parsing andgeneration.The early predominance of linguistic data processing("linguistische Datenverarbeitung") has been relati-vized in Germany, as elsewhere, by the increase inimportance of the other three fields during the pastdecade, which was inevitably reflected in the SiCcourses.An interesting feature of the German scene, perhapsexplicable in terms of the Whorfian hypothesis, and atany rate reflected in the title of the school, is the loantranslation "Computerlinguistik" for "computationallinguistics."
The more abstract, theoretical sense of"computational" tends to play second fiddle; "comput-ability," as a central notion, is "Berechenbarkeit,"though no-one would (I hope) dream of referring to"Berechnungslinguistik."
However, the term tends to364 Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987The Finite String Newsletter Announcementscloud the boundaries between the areas mentionedabove even more than usual.Historically, the current upsurge of interest in com-putational linguistics is, then, partly associated with thefactor of rising general interest in concrete applicationsof computers, particularly microcomputers, with theidea that experience in language-oriented computerapplications may be a useful kind of qualification forlanguage and linguistics graduates in an age whentraditional occupations uch as state school languageteaching are on the decline.Another pragmatic factor is the current demand forresearch and development in natural anguage orientedbranches of AI, in particular for German natural lan-guage access ystems for databases and expert systemsand in the context of machine translation, activitieswhich have been increasing in importance over the pastten years in German universities, industry and in fund-ing policy.A factor which has perhaps contributed less to cur-rent interest han it has elsewhere is theoretical linguis-tics, with an interest in computational properties ofnatural anguages, and in developments and controver-sies which have motivated the development of compu-tational tools for the development and testing of linguis-tic descriptions.
During the past decade, linguistics inGermany has been strongly descriptive, with emphasison empirical and interpretative r search in fields such associolinguistics, discourse analysis, and language acqui-sition, with less emphasis on the formal properties oflanguage structures and processes.
The inauguration ofthe "Sektion Computerlinguistik" in the DGfS hasre-affirmed the importance of such issues, however.A more detailed understanding of current interestsmay be gleaned from the SiC Summer School pro-gramme.
Five types of events were offered: thematiccourses, intensive practical programming courses inLISP and PROLOG (elementary and advanced), a lec-ture cycle by course teachers, invited and guest lec-tures, and panel discussions.
Munich in September alsooffered a limitless range of additional activities, ofcourse.The courses were held by Hans Altmann and Joa-chim Jacobs (Munich), Rainer Baeuerle (Tuebingen),Robin Cooper (Madison & Edinburgh), Konrad Ehlich(Dortmund) and Jochen Rehbein (Hamburg), Hans-Juergen Eikmeyer (Bielefeld), Elisabet Engdahl (Mad-ison & Lund), Guenter Goerz (Erlangen), Helmar Gust(Osnabrueck), Christopher Habel (Hamburg), HansHaugeneder and Manfred Gehrke (Siemens, Munich),Roland Hauser (Munich), Wolfgang Hoeppner (Ham-burg, Koblenz), Werner Kasllmeyer (Mannheim), Mar-tin Kay (Xerox Palo Alto), James Kilbury (Trier),Juergen Krause (Regensburg), Wolfgang Kreitmair(Tuebingen), Michael Keoenig (Berlin), SebastianLoebner (Dusseldorf), Katharina Morik (Berlin), PeterSells (CSLI Stanford), Hans Guenther Tillman & Lies-lotte Schiefer (Munich), Hans Uszkoreit (IBM Stuttgartand Stanford), Dietmar Zaefferer (Munich), and AnnieZaenen (CSLI Stanford).There was a wide range of topics, from more specif-ically descriptive and theoretical linguistics topics like"Syntax and Intonation," "Quantification," Ana-phora," and "Discourse Analysis" to contemporarylinguistic theories (in particular GPSG, LFG, GB) andcomputational linguistic questions of parsing, unifica-tion, simulation, linguistic formalisms, with linguisti-cally relevant AI topics such as knowledge representa-tion or question-answer systems, and finally signalprocessing in experimental phonetics.In addition to lectures by SiC course teachers, in-vited lectures were given on computational linguisticand AI NL topics by Lauri Karttunen (Stanford), HenkZeevat (Edinburgh), Jun-Ichi Tsujii (Kyoto), Petr Sgali(Prague), Egbert Lehmann (Siemens Munich), ClausRainer Rollinger (IBM Stuttgart), Jaap Hoepelman(Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Stuttgart), and ThomasChristaller (Gesellschaft uer Mathematik und Datenve-rarbeitung St. Augustin).The range of courses was rather wide; nevertheless,there remained sufficient coherence for students to beable to construct individual programmes, consisting as arule of four of the courses (two hours, every other day)with complementary and interconnected topics.
Thepresent writer's selection was Kay on "UnificationGrammar," Kilbury on "Parsing in PROLOG," Usz-koreit on GPSG and, further afield, Tiilmann andSchiefer on "Signal Processing in Experimental Phonet-ics."
Reactions to the courses were varied, of course,and tended to be polar and "Relevanz" oriented; not afew participants were dismayed at finding so muchtheoretical linguistics and so few recipes for instant NLsystems.But the impact of the SiC Summer School on Germanlinguistics has already been considerable and positive,not least in re-encouraging work among German lin-guists in fundamental theoretical questions about lan-guage and computability, and fostering an awareness ofthe importance of "useful formalisms."
The effect ofthe Summer School will undoubtedly continue to be feltin the coming years.CONFERENCE ONTHEORETICAL ASPECTS OF REASONING ABOUTKNOWLEDGE6-9 March 1988, Asilomar Conference Center, Monterey,CaliforniaSPONSORED BY: The IBM Corporation and theAmerican Association for Artificial Intelligence.While traditionally research in this area was mainlydone by philosophers and linguists, reasoning aboutknowledge has been shown recently to be of greatComputational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 365
