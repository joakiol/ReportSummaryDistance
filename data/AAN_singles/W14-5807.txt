In this paper we show how morphosemantic informationavailable for morphologically rich languages can be used to reduce manual effort in creatingsemantic resources like PropBank and VerbNet; to increase performance of word sense disam-biguation, semantic role labeling and related tasks.
We test the consistency of these features ina pilot study for Turkish and show that; 1) Case markers are related with semantic roles and 2)Morphemes that change the valency of the verb follow a predictable pattern.1 IntroductionIn recent years considerable amount of research has been performed on extracting semantic informationfrom sentences.
Revealing such information is usually achieved by identifying the complements (argu-ments) of a predicate and assigning meaningful labels to them.
Each label represents the argument?srelation to its predicate and is referred to as a semantic role and this task is named as semantic rolelabeling (SRL).
There exists some comprehensive semantically interpreted corpora such as FrameNetand PropBank.
These corpora, annotated with semantic roles, help researchers to specify SRL as atask, furthermore are used as training and test data for supervised machine learning methods (Giugleaand Moschitti, 2006).
These resources differ in type of semantic roles they use and type of additionalinformation they provide.FrameNet (FN) is a semantic network, built around the theory of semantic frames.
This theorydescribes a type of event, relation, or entity with their participants which are called frame elements(FEs).
All predicates in same semantic frame share one set of FEs.
A sample sentence annotated withFrameNet, VerbNet and PropBank conventions respectively, is given in Ex.
1.
The predicate ?buy?
be-longs to ?Commerce buy?, more generally ?Commercial transaction?
frame of FrameNet which contains?Buyer?, ?Goods?
as core frame elements and ?Seller?
as a non-core frame element as in Ex.
1.
FN alsoprovides connections between semantic frames like inheritance, hierarchy and causativity.
For examplethe frame ?Commerce buy?
is connected to ?Importing?
and ?Shopping?
frames with ?used by?
relation.Contrary to FN, VerbNet (VN) is a hierarchical verb lexicon, that contains categories of verbs basedon Levin Verb classification (Schuler, 2006).
The predicate ?buy?
is contained in ?get-13.5.1?
class ofVN, among with the verbs ?pick?, ?reserve?
and ?book?.
Members of same verb class share same setof semantic roles, referred to as thematic roles.
In addition to thematic roles, verb classes are definedwith different possible syntaxes for each class.
One possible syntax for the class ?get-13.5.1?
is givenin the second line of Ex.
1.
Unlike FrameNet and VerbNet, PropBank (PB) (Palmer et al., 2005) doesnot make use of a reference ontology like semantic frames or verb classes.
Instead semantic roles arenumbered from Arg0 to Arg5 for the core arguments.Ex.

Also, the only available morphologically and syntacticallyannotated treebank corpus: METU-Sabanci Dependency Treebank (Eryi?git et al., 2011), (Oflazer et al.,2003), (Atalay et al., 2003) has only about 5600 sentences, which has presumably a low coverage ofTurkish verbs.
VerbNet defines possible syntaxes for each class of verbs.
However, due to free wordorder and excessive case marking system, syntactic information is already encoded with case markersin Turkish.
Thus the structure of VerbNet does not fit well to the Turkish language.
PropBank simpli-fies semantic roles, but defines neither relations between verbs nor all possible syntaxes for each verb.Moreover only Arg0 and Arg1 are associated with a specific semantic content, which reduces the consis-tency among labeled arguments.
Due to lack of a large-scale treebank corpus, building a high coveragePropBank is currently not possible for Turkish.
FrameNet defines richer relations between verbs, but theframe elements are extremely fine-grained and building such a comprehensive resource requires a greatamount of manual work for which human resources are not currently available for Turkish.In this paper, we discuss how the semantic information supplied by morphemes, named as morphose-mantics, can be included in the construction of semantic resources for languages with less resources andrich morphologies, like Turkish.
We try to show that we can decrease manual effort for building suchbanks and increase consistency and connectivity of the resource by exploiting derivational morphology ofverbs; eliminate mapping costs by associating syntactic information with semantic roles and increase theperformance of SRL and word sense disambiguation by directly using morphosemantic information sup-plied with inflectional morphology.
Then, we perform a pilot study to build a lexical semantic resourcethat contains syntactic information as well as semantic information that is defined by semantic roles bothin VerbNet and PropBank fashion, by exploiting morphological properties of Turkish language.2 Related WorkIn study by Agirre et al.
(2006) and Aldezabal et al.
(2010), the authors discuss the suitability of Prop-Bank model for Basque verbs.
In addition to semantic role information, the case markers that are relatedto these roles are also included in the verb frames.
It is stated that including case markers in BasquePropBank as a morphosemantic feature is useful for automatic tagging of semantic roles for Basquelanguage which has 11 case markers.
Hawwari et al.
(2013) present a pilot study for building ArabicMorphological Pattern Net, that aims at representing a direct relationship between morphological pat-terns and semantic roles for Arabic language.
Authors experiment with 10 different patterns and 2100verb frames and analyze the structure and behavior of these Arabic verbs.
The authors state that theresults encourage them for a more comprehensive study.
The SRL system for Arabic (Diab et al., 2008)and the light-verb detection system for Hungarian (Vincze et al., 2013) also benefited from the relationbetween case markers and semantic roles.Furthermore, there are studies on exploiting morphosemantics in WordNets for different languages.Fellbaum et al.
(2007), manually inspects WordNet?s verb-noun pairs to find one-to-one mapping be-tween an affix and a semantic role for English language.
For example the nouns derived from the verbswith the suffixes ?er and ?or, like invent-inventor usually results as the agents of the event.
How-ever, it is stated that only two thirds of the pairs with this pattern could be classified as agents of theevents.
More patterns are examined and the regularity of these patterns are shown to be low for Englishlanguage.
In another work (Bilgin et al., 2004), authors propose a methodology, on exploiting morphose-mantic information in languages where the morphemes are more regular.
They perform a case study onTurkish, and propose application areas both monolingually and multilingually, such as globally enrichingWordNets and auto detecting errors in WordNets.
In a similiar work (Mititelu, 2012), morphosemanticinformation is added to Romanian WordNet and the proposed application areas in Bilgin et al.
(2004) areexamined and shown to be feasible.Previous studies based on building Basque PropBank focus on the building process of Basque Prop-Bank, rather than analysis of the regularity of case markers and the relation between semantic roles andcase markers.
Furthermore, the study related to building Arabic Morphological Pattern Net, aims to builda seperate dataset and map it to other resources such as Arabic VerbNet, WordNet and PropBank.
Word-47Net has rich cross-language morphosemantic links however it does not list all arguments of predicates,thus its structure is not convenient for NLP tasks like semantic role labeling.
These studies either makeuse of case markers or derivational morphology of verbs, not both.
Moreover, some of them requiresextra mapping resources and some are diffucult to get utilized for semantic interpretation of sentences.Most important of all, none of the studies investigates Turkish language.
To the best of our knowledge,this is the first attempt to build such a lexical semantic resource for Turkish and perform experimentson data to expose the relationship between semantic roles and morphemes known as case markers andvalency changers in Turkish.3 Morphosemantic FeaturesIn morphologically rich languages, the meaning of a word is strongly determined by the morphemesthat are attached to it.
Some of these morphemes always add a predefined meaning while some differ,depending on the language.
However, only regular features can be used for NLP tasks that requireautomatic semantic interpretation.
Here, we determine two multilingual morphosemantic features: casemarkers and verb valency changing morphemes and analyze the regularity and usability of these featuresfor Turkish.3.1 Declension and Case MarkingDeclension is a term used to express the inflection of nouns, pronouns, adjectives and articles for gender,number and case.
It occurs in many languages such as Arabic, Basque, Sanskrit, Finnish, Hungarian,Latin, Russian and Turkish.

In languages where case markers exist, these?
can be used as features for Semantic Role Labeling,?
can supply prior information for disambiguating word senses,?
can be used in language generation as such: Once the predicate and the sense is determined, thearguments can directly be inflected with the case markers associated with their roles.2Throughout the paper NOM is used as nominative, ACC as accusative, DAT as dative, LOC as locative, ABL as ablative,COM as comitative.483.2 Valency Changing MorphemesThe valency of a verb can be defined as the verb?s ability to govern a particular number of argumentsof a particular type.
?In Turkish, verb stems govern relatively stable valency patterns or prototypicalargument frames?
as stated by Haig (1998).
Consider the root verb giy ?to wear?.
One can derive newverbs from the root giy ?to wear?
such as giy-in ?to get dressed?, giy-dir ?to dress someone?
and giy-il?to be worn?.
These verbs are referred to as verb stems and these special suffixes are referred to asvalency changing morphemes.
Some advantages of valency changing morphemes are?
They exist for many languages.?
They are regular, easy to model and morphological analyzers available for such languages cananalyze the valency of the verb stem.?
They are directly related to the number and type of the arguments, which are important for SRLrelated tasks.By modeling the semantic role transformation from verb root to verb stem, we can automatically identifyargument configuration of a new verb stem given the correct morphological analysis.
By doing so,framing only the verb roots can guarantee to have frames of all verb stems derived from that root.
Thisquickens the process of building a semantic resource, as well as automatizing and reducing the humanerror.
In this section we present a pilot study for some available valencies in Turkish language.
For thesake of simplicity, instead of thematic roles, argument labeling in the PropBank fashion is used.ReflexiveAs the word suggests, in reflexive verbs, the action defined by the verb has its effect directly on theperson/thing who does the action (Hengirmen, 2002).
The reflexive suffix triggers the suppression ofone of the arguments.
In Fig.
1 observed argument shift and in Table 3 some interesting reflexive Turkishverbs are given like besle ?to feed?
and besle-n ?to eat - feed himself?.[Kac?a?g-?]A1sakla-d?-lar.

The action may be done togetheror against each other.
Reciprocal verbs may have a plural agent or two or more singular co-agentsconjoined where one of them marked with COM case as shown in Fig 2.
In both cases, the suppressionof one of the arguments of the root verb is triggered.
We have observed that the supressed argument maybe in different roles (patient, theme, stimulus, experiencer, co-patient), but usually appears as Arg1 andrarely as Arg2.
In Table 4, a small list of reciprocal verbs is given.
Some semantic links are easy to see,whereas the link between d?ov ?to beat?
and d?ov-?us?
?to fight?
is not that explicit.[O?glan]A0[k?z-?]A1?op-t?u.

(to get to know) each otherTable 4: Examples of reciprocal verbsCausativeCausative category is the most common valence-changing category among Bybee?s (1985) world-widesample of 50 languages.
Contrary to other morphemes, causative morpheme introduces of a newargument called causer to the valence pattern.
In most of the languages, only intranstive verbs arecausitivized (Haspelmath and Bardey, 1991).
In this case, as shown in Fig.
3 the causee becomes thepatient of the causation event.
In other words, the central argument of the root verb, (Arg0 if exists,otherwise Arg1), is marked with ACC case and becomes an internal argument (usually Arg1) of the newcausative verb.
Some languages can have causatives from transitive verbs too, however the role and themark of the causee may differ across languages.
For the languages where the causee becomes an indirectobject, like Turkish and Georgian, the central argument, Arg0 of the root verb, when transformed into averb stem, receives the DAT case marker and serves as an indirect object (usually as Arg2), while Arg1serves again as Arg1.
This pattern for transitive verbs is given in Fig.
3.
Some implicit relations exist inTable 5 such as ?ol ?to die?, and cause someone to die ?ol-d?ur ?to kill?.
Transformation for intransitiveverb laugh and transitive verb wear, is causitivized as follows:[K?z]A0g?ul-?uyor.

In Table 6, English sentences with different syn-tactic realizations and their translation into Turkish are given among with thematic roles annotated with50VN convention.3In the second column, all words written in bold represent the arguments in destinationroles.
English sentences can not decribe a common syntax for the destination role; different prepositionssuch as into, at, onto precedes the argument.
However, in Turkish sentences they are always marked withdative case.
Similiarly, in the last column of Table 6, source and initial location roles are emphasized.Again, it is hard to find a distinguishing feature that reveals these roles in English sentences.
There maybe different prepositions out of, from or no preposition at all, before the argument in one of these roles,but they are naturally marked with ablative case in Turkish sentences.Lang Destination Source#1.En SheAgloaded boxesThinto the wagonDest.

In recent studies, argument?s relative position to predicate (before, after) andvoice of the sentence (passive, active) were experimented as features for automatic SRL (Wu, 2013).However, there exist many features and finding the best features requires feature engineering and againextra time.
These toy examples suggest that there may be a correlation between case markers and seman-tic roles.
If that is the case, the SRL task can be reduced to predicate and argument identification task,since the labeling will be automatically or semi-automatically done by using case markers as features.Word Sense DisambiguationThe task of finding the meaning of a word in the context in question is called word sense disambiguation.In Table 7 three senses of Turkish verb lemma ay?r and their arguments with case markers are given.
Inthe first sense, the arguments are marked with ACC and DAT, with ABL and NOM in the second and withACC, ABL in the third.
The second and the third senses are similiar.
The action of reserving is usuallyperformed on an indefinite object which usually appears in NOM form, where seperating is applied on acertain object that is usually marked with ACC case.
After the arguments are identified, one can easilydetect the sense of the verb ?ay?r?

As discussed in Section 3.2, we assume we can automatically frame a verb (e.gsakla ?
n(reflexive)) that is derived with a regular valency changing morpheme (e.g.
n), if the ar-gument configuration of the root verb (e.g.
sakla) is known.
Hence, we have only framed root verbs.We have framed 233 root verbs and 452 verb senses.
We have calculated the total number of valencechanging morphemes as 425.
This means 425 verbs can be automatically framed by applying the valencypatterns to 233 root verbs.
In this analysis we have only considered one sense of the verb since there maybe cases where valency changing morpheme can not be applied to another sense of the verb.
This can3Throughout the paper Ag is used as agent, Th as theme, Dest as destination, Sou as source, Pat as Patient, IniLoc as initiallocation.51(a) Case marker info given in suffixlist(b) Verb derivational info as a dropdown menuFigure 4: Cornerstone Software Adjusted for Turkishnot be automatically determined.
Moreover, a verb stem may have multiple senses.
In that case automat-ically extracted argument transformation may be wrong, because the verb stem may have a completelydifferent meaning.Turkish is not among rich languages by means of computational resources as discussed before.
TurkishLanguage Association (TDK) is a trustworthy source for lexical datasets and dictionaries.
To run thispilot study, we have used the list of Turkish root verbs provided by TDK and the TNC corpus4.
Theinterface built for searching the TNC corpus gives the possibility to see all sentences that were built withthe verb the user is searching for (Aksan and Aksan, 2012).
The senses of the verbs and case marking oftheir arguments are decided by manually investigating the sentences appear in search results of the TNCcorpus.
Then, the arguments of the predicates are labeled with VerbNet thematic roles and PropBankargument numbers, by checking the English equivalent of Turkish verb sense.
This process is repeatedfor all verb senses.For framing purposes, we have adjusted an already available open source software, cornerstone (Choiet al., 2010)5.
To supply case marking information of the argument, a drop down menu containing sixpossible case markers in Turkish is added as shown in Fig 4a.
Finally, another drop down menu thatcontains all possible suffixes that a Turkish verb can have is added, shown in Fig 4b.
Theoretically, thenumber of possible derivations may be infinite for some Turkish verbs, due to its rich generative property.However, practically the average number of inflectional groups in a word is less than two (Oflazer etal., 2003).
TDK provides a lexicon6for widely used verb stems derived from root verbs by a valencychanging morpheme.
To avoid framing a nonexisting verb, we have used a simple interface shown inFig 4b to enter only the stems given by TDK.
An example with the Turkish verb bin ?to ride?
is given inFig 4b.
The first line defines that one can generate a stem bin-il ?to be ridden by someone?
from the rootbin by using the suffix l. Similiarly, second line illustrates a two layer derivational morphology, whichcan be interpreted as producing two verbs: bin-dir ?cause someone to ride something?
and bin-dir-il ?tobe caused by someone to ride something?.5 Experiments and ResultsIn Table 8, number of co-occurences of each thematic role with each case marker are given.
Since inPropBank only Arg0 and Arg1 have a certain semantic interpretation, we have used VerbNet thematicroles in our analysis.
Some roles look highly related with a case marker, while some look arbitrary.
Re-sults can be interpreted in two ways: 1) If the semantic roles are known and case marker information isneeded, Agent will be marked with NOM, Destination with DAT, Source with ABL and Recipient withDAT case with more than 0.98 probability, furthermore Patient and Theme can be restricted to NOM orACC cases; 2) If case markers are known and semantic role information is needed, only restrictions andprior probabilities can be provided.
Highest probabilities occur with COM-instrument, LOC-location,DAT-destination, ACC-Theme and NOM-Agent pairs.

The#Hold column shows the number of root verbs for which the proposed patterns hold, and #!Hold showsthe number of times the pattern can not be observed.
Reflexive pattern can only be applied to transitiveverbs, while others can be applied to both.
Experiments are done for reflexive, reciprocal and causativeforms.
Our preliminary results on a small set of root verbs show that proposed argument transformationcan be seen as a regular transformation.6 Conclusion and Future WorkIn this study, we presented a pilot study for building a Turkish lexical semantic resource for 452 verbsenses by making use of two morphosemantic features that appear to be useful for challenging NLPtasks.
Our experimental results on 814 arguments showed that the first feature, case markers, are notarbitrarily linked with a semantic role.
This brings us to a conclusion that they can be a distinguishingfeature for SRL, word sense disambiguation and language generation tasks.
We ran some experiments forthe second feature, valency changing morphemes and observed that the transformation of the argumentstructures of root to stem follows a specific pattern, hence proposed transformation seems to be regularand predictable.
The results suggest that argument configuration of the root verb may be enough to labelany verb stem derived with valency changing morphemes.
This gives us the ability to build a semanticresource in a shorter time and reduce the human error, as well as provide a direct relationship like?causativity?, ?reflexivity?
and ?reciprocity?
between verbs except for some problematic cases explainedin Sect.

To conclude, this study encourages us to continue using morphosemantic features and increasethe size of this resource.7 AcknowledgementsWe thank G?uls?en Eryi?git and our three anonymous reviewers for insightful comments and suggestionsthat helped us improve this work.ReferencesEneko Agirre, Izaskun Aldezabal, Jone Etxeberria and Eli Pociello 2006.
