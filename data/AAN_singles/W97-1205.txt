Can pitch accent type convey information status in yes-noquestions?Mart ine Grice* and Michel ina Savino*'i"*Institute of Phonetics, FR 8.7, University of the Saarland,Postfach 1150, 66041 Saarbrticken, Germany1-Politecnico di Bari, Italymgrice@coli.uni-sb.de, esavino@poliba.itAbstractThis paper analyses the intonation of polarquestions extracted from a corpus of task-oriented dialogues in the Bari variety ofItalian.
They are classified using a systemdeveloped for similar dialogues in Englishwhere each question is regarded as an init-iating move in a conversational game(Carletta et al1995).
It was found that therewas no one-to-one correspondence b tweenmove-type and intonation pattern.
An alter-native classification was carried out takinginto account information status, that is,whether or not the information requested bythe speaker isrecoverable from the previousdialogue context.
It is found that he degreeof confidence with which the speaker believ-es the information to be shared with the inter-locutor is reflected in the choice of pitchaccent and postfocal ccentual pattern.
Lowconfidence polar questions contain a L+H*focal pitch accent and allow for accents tofollow it, whereas high confidence ones con-tain a H*+L focal pitch accent, followed bydeaccenting orsuppression of accents.1 IntroductionIn this paper we examine the intonation ofpolar questions.
Such questions may elicit anaffirmative or negative reply concerning in-formation which is totally new, i.e.
where thespeaker believes the information is not re-coverable from the dialogue context.
Theseare often referred to as information-seekingquestions.
They may also; however, refer toold information, i.e.
that which the speakerbelieves has already been conveyed.
These areoften referred to as confirmation-seekingquestions.
Using a corpus of task-orienteddialogues, we investigate how far it is possiblein such questions to make a clear-cut binarydistinction between old and new informationand whether this distinction is reflected in thechoice of intonation pattern used.A distinction has been made in the analysisof a dialogue corpus in English (Carletta et al1995) where information-seeking questionsare referred to as QUERIES and confirmation-seeking questions as CHECKS.
In the canon-ical examples given in English, QUERIES andCHECKS are syntactically distinct (Kowtko etal, 1992; Carletta et al 1995); "Do you have arockfall?"
and "So you want me to go downtwo inches?
", respectively.
The former usesinterrogative and the latter declarative syntax.In Italian, on the other hand, where all yes-noquestion types have the same syntactic formas declaratives, the intonation pattern plays agreater role.
"Vado a destra" can be translatedas "I go to the right" (statement), "Do I go tothe fight?"
(QUERY) or "(So) I go to theright?"
(CHECK).
We therefore investigatedialogues in Italian where it is possible toisolate the role of intonation patterns.Intonation contours can be analysed ashaving two types of tonal specification: toneswhich have a prominence-lending function,referred to here as pitch accents, and thosewhich delimit intonational phrases, referred tohere as boundary tones (Pierrehumbert,1980;Beckman and Ayers 1994).
In Standard Italian(SI), it is argued that the boundary tone or acombination of pitch accent and boundarytone play a role in distinguishing questionsfrom statements (Avesani, 1990; Chapallaz,1979; D'Eugenio, 1982; Canepari, 1980;Agard and di Pietro, 1965).
In all cited casesof SI yes-no questions have a final risingcontour or high boundary tone.
In a number ofother varieties of Italian, those spoken in Bari(Grice and Savino, 1995) and Palermo (Grice291995) for instance, it is solely the pitch accentwhich has the distinguishing function.
Ouranalysis here is based on a corpus of BariItalian dialogues, allowing us to concentrateon the relation between pitch accent ype andquestion type.2 Dialogue CorpusThe corpus analysed consists of task-orienteddialogues between six pairs of Bari Italianspeakers.
The task, based on the HCRC MapTask (Anderson et al 1991), involves verbalco-operation (via auditory channel only) be-tween two participants, each having a map,with the aim of transferring as accurately aspossible a given route from one map to theother.
There are a number of discrepancies inplacement and positioning of the landmarkson the maps.
Since our aim was to examineintonation contours, the landmark names con-tained mainly sonorants and were controlledfor word stress pattern.3 Intonation analysisThe intonation analysis employs a modifiedversion of the ToBI transcription system(Beckman and Ayers 1994) using two tones,H (high) and L (low).
When they occur inpitch accents, one tone is starred, indicatingassociation with a metrically strong syllable(Pierrehumbert 1980).
They may also functionas boundary markers for one of two phrasetypes: intermediate (or minor), indicated by"-" after H or L, and intonation (or major)phrase, marked with "%".
The pitch accentsreferred to in this paper are L+H*, whichinvolves a low pitch target just before a highaccented syllable, H+L*, which involves ahigh pitch target immediately preceding a lowaccented syllable, and H*+L, a high targetearly in the accented syllable followed by arapid fall (see Grice and Savino 1995 for adiscussion of peak placement).
In addition, H*and L* involve a high or low target,respectively, on the accented syllable, with nospecification as to the pitch contour flankingit.
The boundary tones referred to are L- andthe combination L-L%, both of which give alow pitch value at the end of the phrase, andthe combination L-H% which gives a slightrise up to the end of the phrase, with a lowstarting point at some distance before theendpoint.4 Question typesThe questions occurring in our corpus aredescribed with the coding scheme forconversational games used to describe theEnglish HCRC Map Task corpus (Kowtko etal 1992, Carletta et al1995).
Conversationalgames are sequences of acts, referred to asmoves, such as the possible sequence ofQUERY-REPLY-ACKNOWLEDGE moveswithin a QUERY game.
Since each movewithin a given game may have a distinctintonation pattern, we confine our analysis toindividual moves.The analysis here concentrates onQUERIES and CHECKS as described in 1above, both of which are initiating moveswithin games of the same name.
The MapTask coding scheme has another question-typewhere the speaker is attempting to getevidence that the transfer was successful, sothat s/he can move onto the next game.
This iscalled an ALIGN.
Examples of ALIGNSmight be "Have you drawn it?"
or "OK?
".They may seek information about new or oldmaterial within the discourse and may thuspattern with either of the above-mentionedquestion moves.
Another move-type found inour corpus is not categorised in the currentMap Task coding scheme, but may be fittedinto the framework as a responding movewhich indicates that the communication hasbeen unsuccessful.
We refer to this move asOBJECT.
It is used to point out that there hasbeen a break-down in communication, suchthat the game cannot continue until commonground is re-established.
OBJECT movescontrast with ACKNOWLEDGE moves.These latter indicate that communication hasbeen successful, and encourage theinterlocutor to proceed with the game.Examples of OBJECT moves discussed beloware of the type that are categorised elsewhereas 'echo questions' (inter alia Cruttenden1986), because they echo, or repeat, all or partof what has just been said by the interlocutor.Because these types of OBJECT move areconsidered to be a category of question in theintonation literature, they are analysed herealongside moves of questioning force.
How-ever, since they could be responding within30one game as well as initiating another (sub)-game, they cannot be classif ied as s implequestions, which have only an initiating funct-ion (Carletta et al 1995).5 In tonat ion  and movesThe intonation contours used for each type ofmove will be discussed and exempl i f iedbelow, along with the dialogue context fromwhich the example has been excised (where Gis the route giver and F the follower).
Anulnber of examples are accompanied by F0traces.
The basenames of the associatedspeech and F0 files are given in angledbrackets.QUERY Moves - QUERIES have a rising-falling intonation pattern, rising up to theaccented syllable and down from it, tran-scribed as L+H* L-L%.
The final boundarytone may be H% instead of L%.
An initial H*pitch accent (PA) is optional; it is not presentin all examples of QUERY move.1.
Hai aGNELlo?H* L+H* L-L%context:G: hal agnello?
(do you have lamb?
)F: noIf the accented syllable is final in the phrase,the fall on that sy l lable is curta i ledsubstantially, as i l lustrated in Grice et al(1995).
If the focus (see e.g.
Gussenhoven1983 for a definition of focus) is not on thefinal lexical item in the phrase (henceforthreferred to as non-final), the PA on the focus-sed item is followed by an intermediate phrase(ip) boundary.
The rest of the question con-stitutes another ip which has a reduced rangeand has an identical PA and boundary tone.That second ip is similar to what has been de-scribed by Crystal (1969) as a subordinatetone group.
For a theoretical account seeGrice (1995) which refers to analogous casesin Palermo Italian ~2.
<un-giro> fa un Glro (foc) intorno all'alBERgo?L+H* L- L+H* L-L%1 The interrogative PA in Palermo Italian is L*+H, notL+H* as in Bari Italian.context:F: ... no, aspetta, scusa, la la strada passa da sotto, haidetto(...no, wait a minute, sorry, the the path goesunderneath, you said)G: si ?, da sotto l'albergo Malaga(yes, under hotel Malaga)\[pause\]F: ecco, e poi la la il devo questa strada devo farla ehmtocc.., devo devoehm dove dove la faccio terminate?Fa un GIRO intorno all'albergo?
(right, and then the the I have to this - path - I have toerm touch...
I have to erm where where do I make itfinish ?
Does it go ROUND the hotel?
)G: ecco,(right,)The above case involves what appears to bereaccenting,  as discussed by Crut tenden(1993), on the word a lbergo (hotel), which isgiven in the dialogue context.
In cases wherethe subject occupies entence-final position, italso constitutes a subordinate intermediatephrase with its own accent, the focal PA beingin the first ip, as in 3.3. era numeRAto questo perCORso?L+H* L- L+H* L-L%context:G oh adesso segna la croce alia sinistra del lagoAnomalo esiamo arrivati(Oh now put the cross on the left of lake Anomalo andwe're there)F era numerato questo pereorso?
(was it numbered, this path?
)G noCHECK Moves  - The intonat ion ofCHECKS is inf luenced by the degree ofspeaker confidence as to the correctness of theinferred material it contains, that is, the degreeof speaker confidence that the material is old.CHECKS which are tentative may have anintonation contour which is indistinguishablef rom that of QUERIES ;  in terms ofin fo rmat ion  structure,  ne i ther  conta ininformation which is confidently deemed bythe current speaker to be old.
An example of atentative CHECK is in 4 below.4.
<curvR>QUINdi anche QUI (foc) c'e' una leggera CURva?H* L- L+H*L- L+H* L-L%(So there's a gentle curve even HERE?
)31Confident CHECKS have a different pitchaccent: H*+L.
Moreover ,  there is noreaccenting of post-focal material.
Where thefocus is non-final, the focussed pitch accent isfol lowed by a word receiving a strongprominence without a pitch excursion (inBritish School terms, the appropriate syllablein the word is stressed but not accented;Crystal 1969).
We refer to such a prominenceas a suppressed accent.
In example 5 below,there is an accent on "devo" and a suppressedaccent on "scritta".5.
<non-devo> non DEvo andare verso la scrittaH*+L L%context:G: ... continua sempre come grossa curva intorno tuttoal lago Anomalo fino a un certo punto.
Ci sei con lamente?
(...keep going in a big curve around lake Anomalo untila certain point.
Are you with me ?
)F: No.
Altora, il lago Anomalo devo ehm praticamentenon DEVO andare verso la scritta(No.
So, lake Anomalo, I have to erm practically...I don "t HA VE to go towards the wriang)An equivalent syntactic structure to that inexample 3, where the subject is sentence-final,is in 6 below.
In both examples 5 and 6, thechoice of H*+L pitch accent is motivated bythe perceptual impression of a sharp fall onthe accented syllable.
In fact, the F0 peakoccurs very early in the accented syllable incontrast o the F0 peak on L+H* pitch accentswhich generally occurs in the second half ofthe syllable.It is unclear whether the analysis shouldinclude a L- boundary after "devo", with theimplication that what follows is an ip with nopitch accent, a combination so far onlypostulated for tags.
Since without furtheranalysis, for example of duration data, there isno obvious way of distinguishing between thetwo transcriptions, we opt provisionally forthe analysis without an ip boundary.6.
<tutto-sommato>Quindi sono tutto sommato viCIni (foc)H*+Lbanane meloni e lago anomalo.L-L%(So, all in all, they are close, bananas and melonsand lake anomalo.
)AL IGN Moves - ALIGNS of the type "Vabene?"
or "Ci sei?"
(Are you with me?)
arerealised with the same intonation pattern asfor QUERIES.
Although example 7 below hasa L% boundary tone, they may have either L%or H%.7.
<va-bene> va BEne?L+H* L-L%context:G: allora quindi l percorso lo facciamo al contrario.Va bene?
(well so we'll do the route backwards.Alright?
)These constitute the majority of ALIGNS.However, they may also involve seeking con-firmation of inferred material.
The intonationpattern used in these cases depends on thespeaker's degree of confidence as to the cor-rectness of his/her inferral, as in the CHECKcategory above.OBJECT moves In Bari Italian, theOBJECT moves we have examined have thesame tonal analysis as QUERIES of the yes-no kind.
It is not the tonal analysis but ratherother parameters which appear to distinguishOBJECTS from QUERIES, viz.
"breathy"voice quality and/or expanded range, both ofwhich can signal incredulity.
An examplefrom the corpus is in 8.8.
<anima-mia> Anima rnla(L+)H* L+H* L-L%context:G: C'e l'hai il ristorante Anima mia?
(Do you have it, restaurant "Anima Mia"?
)F: An ima Mia?
!It might be argued that although the actuallexical material in OBJECT moves is old, thedegree of speaker conf idence that theinformation is shared is low.
In example 8, thespeaker is, amongst other things, conveyingthe fact that the interlocutor's assumption thatthe information is shared is incorrect.A summary of the moves and their pitchaccents is in table 1.
It is clear that in twotypes of move either L+H* or H*+L can beused, thus precluding a one-to-one corres-pondence between move-type and pitchaccent.32Move L+H* H*+LQUERYCHECK++ +ALIGN + +OBJECT i +Table 1 Nuclear Pitch Accents in question moves6 Non-finalityFor completeness, example 9 is given belowof a command, referred to as an INSTRUCTmove, which is non-final in a list ofcommands.9.
<legger>aDESso PIEga verso i l  BASso leggerMENteH* L- H* !H* L* L-H%(Now turn slightly downwards,)This pattern is similar to that given for'questions' in Standard Italian, but is distinctfrom any of the patterns found for thequestions examined here for Bail Italian.
An-other non-final pattern (H* H-H%) isdiscussed in Grice et al(1995).7 ConclusionIn this dialogue corpus study, we have ob-served that conversational game move typesdo not necessarily have a specific intonationcontour; CHECKS and ALIGNS may haveeither of two distinct types of pitch accent.QUERIES and OBJECTS have the same pitchaccent, but differ in other parameters.
How-ever, we have found that pitch accent ype re-tlects the degree to which the speaker believeswhether the current question contains haredmaterial.
Where the speaker is lacking in con-fidence as to whether the material is old ornot, the same pitch accent, L+H*, accompan-ied by reaccenting of post-focal material, isused as when it is totally new.
The fact thatOBJECTS contain repeated lexical material,although they pattern with utterances referringto new information, is explained by the factthat this repeated material is considered to beerroneously regarded as shared with the inter-locutor.It therefore appears that speakers do not usepitch accent type to distinguish betweentotally new and possibly new material, butthat they do distinguish between those casesand ones where they are reasonably confidentthat material is old.
Further research usingperceptual testing is planned to confirm thishypohesis.ReferencesAgard, F.B.
