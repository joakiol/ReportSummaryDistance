HowNet is an on-linecommon-sense knowledgebase unveilinginter-conceptual relationships and inter-attribute relationships of concepts asconnoting in lexicons of the Chinese andtheir English equivalents.
(2) How itfunctions in the computation of meaningand as a NLP platform?
The presentationwill show 9 HowNet-based applicationtools.
All of them are not merely demon-stration of some methodology or algo-rithm, but are real application tools thatcan be tested by users themselves.
Apartfrom the tools that are specially designedto deal with Chinese, most of the toolsare bilingual, even the WSD tool.1  What is HowNetHowNet is an on-line common-sense knowled-gebase unveiling inter-conceptual relationshipsand inter-attribute relationships of concepts asconnoting in lexicons of the Chinese and theirEnglish equivalents.
To put it simply, relation-ship is the soul of HowNet, as well as the worldknowledge.
The relationships that representknowledge can be divided into two categories:Concept Relationship (CR) and Attribute Rela-tionship (AR).It is believed that concept relationships fall in-to a net, which is called Concept Relation Net(CRN) and attribute relationships fall into a nettoo, called Attribute Relation Net (ARN).
Dif-ferent individual has different CRN, even of thesame concept.
This reflects different levels ofknowledge among people.
CRN is elastic or ex-tendable as it varies with individual persons.
Themore knowledge one has, the more concepts hewill master, and what is more, the larger or morecomplicated CRN of the concepts he will know.It can be imagined that a 6-year child may know?doctor?
but his CRN of ?doctor?
would be farfrom that as shown in Fig.
1, which is believedto be mastered by an ordinary adult.
The samecase goes with mankind as a whole.
Mankindincreases his knowledge with each passing yearwhen he enlarges his volume of concepts and atthe same time, the CRN of the concepts.Careful observations find that the meaning ofconcepts is displayed not only by its CRN butalso by the relationships among attributes of theconcepts, as called Attribute Relation Net.
Inmany cases it is the attributes of a concept thatact in the role of meaning representation.
Fig.
2reveals that it is not ?paper?
as a whole that isrelated to ?write?, but only one of its attributes,say ?color?, is related to ?write?
with ?contrast?as the condition.
Therefore in a strict sense, ?pa-per?
is not necessarily related to ?write?.
We cansometimes even write on the sand with a twig oron the table with our wet finger.
On the contrary,we cannot write on a piece of white paper with achalk or on the blackboard in black ink.
There-fore, for writing, what affects may not be thewhole lot of the concept like ?paper?, but someattributes of the concept.
Besides, we can use?paper?
to wrap up something because of itsattributes of the material, which are almost thesame as cloth or plastic.
HowNet is unique in itsfour peculiarities: (1) Use of sememes: HowNetuses sememes to interpret concepts.
Sememesare regarded as the basic unit of the meaning.
(2)Definition in a structuralized language: Eachconcept in HowNet lexicon is defined in a lan-guage, called Knowledge Database MarkupLanguage (KDML).
The KDML is mainly com-posed of sememes and semantic roles.
The53Figure 1 Concept Relation Net (CRN) of ?doctor?Figure 2 Attribute Relation Net (ARN) of ?paper?Knowledge Database Mark-up Language uses2089 sememes, 128 secondary features and 94semantic roles as its vocabulary and adopts anextended BNF as its syntax.
The concept of?doctor (medical)?
is defined in HowNet as:DEF={human|?:HostOf={Occupation|??
},conditionvalue value value valuematerial material instrumentpatientinstrumentattribute attribute attribute attributepapercolor thickness hardnesswhite thin flammable softwritecontrastshopping bagmake burnflammableness54domain={medical|?},{doctor|??
:agent={~}}}All the computation of meaning in HowNetis based on the definitions of the concepts.
(3) Self-sufficiency: Systematic integrationof hierarchical taxonomies, axiomatic inference,KDML-defined concepts.
(4) Language independence: In the finalanalysis, HowNet is not word-oriented asWordNet, but concept-oriented.
Only with theHowNet?s shared definitions can we achieve ashared ontology for all languages.Table 1 shows the latest statistics of the basicdata of HowNet.Chinese Character 7182Chinese Word & Expression 100385English Word & Expression 96565Chinese Meaning 115278English Meaning 121262Definition 30014Record 192191Semantics Chinese EnglishEvent 14554 12881Attribute 4351 4879AttributeValue 10160 10140Things 72016 72016Time 2683 2683Space 1244 1244Component 8577 8577Table 1 statistics of the basic data of HowNet2 HowNet functions as a NLP platformHowNet is developing toward a NLP platform.HowNet is a powerful tool for the computationof meaning.
To date, 9 HowNet-based applica-tion tools have been developed.
They are:1.
HowNet_Browser (E/C bilingual)2.
HowNet_Relevance (E/C bilingual)3.
HowNet_Similarity (E/C bilingual)4.
HowNet_Inference_Pool (E/C bilingual)5.
HowNet_SenseColonyTester (E/C bilin-gual)6.
HowNet_Translate (E-to-C)7.HowNet_Morpho_Processor (Chinese mo-nolingual)8.
HowNet_VN ?
disambiguator for ChineseV-N structure (Chinese monolingual)9.
HowNet_VXY -- disambiguator for Chi-nese V-N-?-N structure  (Chinese monolingual)The purpose for developing these tools is (1)to check the HowNet?s data and framework forits accuracy and coverage so as to test thesoundness of its philosophy and design; (2) topush HowNet near to end applications so as toprovide evidence of its value as knowledge re-sources;Of all these tools, HowNet Browser is thekey.
The Browser contains all HowNet basicdata and provides various kinds of elementaryor shallow computation of meanings.
The basicdata in HowNet can be divided into two parts:firstly, the basic lexical data and secondly tax-onomies.
In the lexical database, each conceptis described in a fixed structure, for example,NO.=046048W_C=?G_C=adj [fu4]S_C=PlusSentiment|????E_C=~??~??~??~????~???????~?~??~????~?????~?W_E=richG_E=adjS_E=PlusSentiment|????E_E=DEF={rich|?
}RMK=With the browser the user can retrieve allkinds of basic relations between concepts, suchas synonym, hypernym, hyponym, etc.
It shouldbe noticed that these kinds of relations in How-Net are not coded manually as the way as donein WordNet, but are computed on the basis ofconcept definitions.
The browser can give allsorts of semantic roles for a given verb concept.To take ?treat?
as a given event, we retrieve allits ?agents?, ?locations?, ?patients?, ?instru-ments?.
This is regarded as the shallow rela-tions between verb concepts and their relevantnoun concepts.Particular attention should be given to ournewly developed tool, HowNet Inference Pool(E/C bilingual).
With the help of an activator ofthe tool we can build a senses pool for any con-cept in HowNet.
The pool covers all sorts ofrelationships under the key concept, for instance,when the concept of ?money?
as the key, it hasa pool with 2600 concepts, including ?bank?,?deposit?, ?borrow?, ?buy?, ?steal?, etc.
Hence55suppose a question like ?can we borrow moneyfrom a bank??
is raised to an inference machine,we are sure that the machine can give a correctanswer with correct selection of meanings, like?bank?
as ?financial bank?.
Moreover based onthe inference machine we have developed aword sense disambiguation tool called HowNetSenseColony Tester (E/C bilingual).
The tool isdesigned to be skilled in tackling the ambiguityof discourse type both in Chinese and English.The words ?governor?, ?state?
in the followingparagraph are so-called those of discourse-ambiguity type:?We provided $250 in relief to more than 5million California seniors -- many whose lifesavings had taken a big hit in the financial crisis.And we provided emergency assistance to ourgovernors to prevent teachers and policeofficers and firefighters from being laid off as aresult of state budget shortfalls.
At a time whenCalifornia is facing a fiscal crisis, we know thatthis has saved the jobs of tens of thousands ofeducators and other needed public servants justin this state.
And what was true in Californiawas true all across the country.
?The tool is language independent; it employsthe data resources and the algorithm of the sametype.HowNet English-Chinese MT system is arule-based system.
It uses HowNet basic data asits English-Chinese bilingual dictionary.
It ispowerful in its strongly semantic basis.
The sys-tem will surely have a bright future in its appli-cation to PDA products and Chinese languagelearning aids.All the HowNet tools are not merely a demoof certain methodology, but are real applica-tions that can be tested by users themselves.ReferencesKeh-Jiann Chen, Shu-Ling Huang, Yueh-Yin Shih,Yi-Jun Chen, 2005, Extended-HowNet: A Repre-sentational Framework for concepts, Proceedingsof Second International Joint Conference 2005Keh-Jiann Chen, 2009, E-HowNet- a Lexical Se-mantic Representation System and its Relation toMorphology, Syntax and Semantics, (keynote talk,at ROCLING XXI 2009)Zhendong Dong and Qiang Dong, 2006.
