Logical Form of Complex Sentencesin Task-Oriented Dialogues*Cecile T. BalkanskiHarvard University, Aiken Computation LabCambridge, MA 02138IntroductionAlthough most NLP researchers agree that a level of"logical form" is a necessary step toward the goal of rep-resenting the meaning of a sentence, few people agree onthe content and form of this level of representation.
Aneven smaller number of people have considered the com-plex action sentences that are often expressed in task-oriented ialogues.
Most existing logical form represen-tations have been developed for single-clause sentencesthat express assertions about properties or actual actionsand in which time is not a main concern.
In contrast,utterances in task-oriented dialogues often express unre-alized actions, e.g., (la), multiple actions and relationsbetween them, e.g., (lb), and temporal information, e.g.,(lc):(1) a.

When the red fight goes off, push the handle.In the following sections, I discuss the issues that arisein defining the logical form of these three types of sen-tences.
The Davidsonian treatment of action sentencesis the most appropriate for my purposes because it treatsactions as individuals \[7\].
For example, the logical formof "Jones buttered the toast" is a three place predicate,including an argument position for the action being de-scribed, i.e., 3x butter(jones, toast, x).
The presence ofthe action variable makes it possible to represent op-tional modifiers as predications of actions and to referto actions in subsequent discourse.
Furthermore, andmore importantly for the present purpose, it facilitatesthe representation of sentences about multiple actionsand relations between them.Unrea l i zed-act ion  sentencesA Davidsonian logical form of sentence (la), namely3x reread(us, manual, x), makes the claim that thereexists a particular action x.
But this is not the intendedmeaning of the sentence.
Instead, this sentence con-cerns a hypothetical action.
The same problem ariseswith sentences (lb) and (lc) which state how typicalactions are related or when to perform a future action.Apparently, Davidson did not have these types of actionin mind when suggesting his theory of logical form.In fact, a closer look at the literature shows thatthe problem of representing action sentences that do*This research as been supported by U S West AdvancedTechnologies, by the Air Force Office of Scientific Researchunder Contract No.AFOSR-89-0273, and by an IBM Grad-uate Fellowship.331not make claims about actions that have or are oc-curring (i.e., actual actions) has been virtually ignored.Hobbs, who also adopts a Davidsonian treatment of ac-tion sentences, is one notable exception \[11\].
His "Pla-tonic universe" contains everything that can be spokenof and the predicate Exist is used to make statementsabout the existence in the actual universe of individu-als in the Platonic universe.
For example, the formulaExists(x) Arun'(x, john) says that the action of John'srunning exists in the actual universe, or, more simply,that John runs.
The approach I am currently investi-gating is to extend Itobbs' representation by introduc-ing predicates stating the existence of actions in future,hypothetical or typical worlds as well as in the actualworld.Another possibility is to adopt the standard philo-sophical approach to the representation of properties,and for that matter, of actions, that are not actuallyinstantiated, namely possible worlds (cf.
\[13, 2\]).
Fur-thermore, and independently of the approach that isadopted, there is a need to identify the different ypesof unrealized actions and determine whether they shouldbe distinguished in the logical form.Mu l t i - c lause  sentencesAnother area of logical form that has not received muchattention is the representation f sentences about multi-ple actions and relations between them.
I have beeninvestigating sentences including by- and to- purposeclauses because they are used to communicate two ac-tion relations, namely generation and enablement, whichI have defined elsewhere \[3\].
In a Davidsonian logicalform, the connectives "by" and "to" can be representedas two-place predicates ranging over action tokens1; e.g.
:(2) To learn how to use the system, read the manual.learn(you, system, xa ) A read(you, manual, x2)Ainorderto(x2, xa)Clauses may also be joined with coordination con-junctions, e.g., (3a), and the resulting constituent mayparticipate in another action relation, as in (lb) andrepeated below in (3b).
I therefore represent these con-neetives by a three place predicate, e.g., and(xl, x2, x4)which is true if action x4 is the conjunction of actionsxl and x2.
In (3a), the action token x4 might seemsuperfluous, but note that it becomes necessary if thataction is referred to in subsequent discourse (e.g., "DoaAlthough this problem interacts with the one discussedin the previous ection, for the purpose of this presentation,I call Davidson's action variables action tokens and representthem as constants in the logical form.it fast!
"); in (3b), the action token z4 can then be usedas the first argument to the by predicate:(3) a.
Get the key and unlock the gate.get(you, key, xl ) ^  unZock(yo,,, gate, x2 )^and(xl, x2, x4)b.
By getting the key and unlocking the gate, youget ten points.get(you, key, xl) ^  unlock(you, gate, z2)^get(you, lOpoints, z3) ^  and(z1, z2, z4) ^  by(x4, za)In the above logical forms, I assume that the by andinorderto predicates denote a two place relation express-ing the "ideal meaning" of the corresponding Englishconnective \[9\].
There is not necessarily a one-to-onemapping between particular linguistic expressions andaction relations, and subsequent pragmatic processingof the logical forms will further interpret hese relations.Representing the embedded clause as an additional ar-gument o the predicate representing the matrix clause(e.g., \[5\]), or representing the relation as a binary sen-tential operator (e.g., \[16\]) are alternative representa-tions, both of which suffer from problems discussed byDavidson because action tokens become irrelevant.
Fur-thermore, the first does not capture the intuitive notionthat these sentences express action relations, and thesecond introduces a lack of homogeneity between logicalforms of sentences involving action relations and thosethat do not.TimeStill another feature that has been overlooked in thestudy of logical form is time.
Although a number of pa-pers include time in their logical forms, most do not dis-cuss their treatment of time and consider primarily pastand present ense examples about actual actions (e.g.,\[1, 5, 1412).
The lack of concern for temporal issues isalso characteristic ofthe literature on semantic interpre-tation (e.g., \[10, 15, 16\]).
On the other hand, there is avast literature on the interpretation and representationof tense, aspect and temporal modifiers, but these pa-pers do not describe the logical forms from which theirrepresentations are generated (e.g., \[4, 6, 8, 12, 17, 18\]).Clearly, there is a missing link between the literatureon logical form and that on tense and aspect.
Providingsuch a link is one of the goals of this research.
David-son's treatment of action sentences does not provide afully satisfying starting point.
Although his initial pa-per does not include any example of temporal modi-fiers, he would probably represent them as predicatesover action tokens, e.g., next_week(x), a representationthat does not make explicit reference to time (to whichanaphors might refer).
Introducing a time predicate,e.g., time(z, next_week), solves this particular problem,but introduces other complexities because this predicatewould not be adequate for all temporal modifiers (e.g.,compare Sue will leave in two hours and Sue reached thetop in two hours).
Given that the aspectual type andtense of the verb, along with the presence of adverbialsand common sense knowledge all interact in the inter-pretation of the temporal information in a sentence \[12\],it might be preferable for such reasoning to be performedwith the logical form as input rather than as output.2Moore \[14\] addresses time issues, but omits future tensesentences and acknowledges problematic interactions be-tween his event abstraction operator and time.ConclusionAlthough many researchers have proposed formalismsfor simple action sentences, very few of them have ad-dressed the issues that arise when extending those for-malisms to the more complex sentences that occur intask-oriented dialogues.
There has been work in each ofthe above areas, but this research as been fragmentaryand still needs to be integrated with that on the logi-cal form of action sentences.
Ironically, the conclusionthat Moore arrived at, ten years ago, is still valid today\[14\]: "If real progress is to be made on understandingthe logical form of natural-language utterances, it mustbe studied in a unified way and treated as an importantresearch problem in its own right."
