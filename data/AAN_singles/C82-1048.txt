It was  at a conference  in P rague  some years  ago that I gave anaccount  of the genera l  resu l t s  gained f rom the study of the mater ia lrendered  by the Hungar ian  d ic t ionary  ment ioned above.
The mat ter  inquest ion is  that a la rge  group  of Hungar ian  nouns der ives  one of the i rimpor tant  fo rms,  namely  the th i rd  person  possess i~ fo rm,  in a way thatseems to be rhapsod ic ,  somet imes  inser t ing  a "j" e lement  and somet imesnot: ablaka 'h i s /her  window'  - ~ 'h i s /her  apr ico t '  ; t t i re lme"h is /~er  pat ience '  - f i lmje  'h i s /her  f i lm ' ,  etc.
Th is  possess~ve f-orm wasreg is tered  with each entry  word,  so we had the oppor tun i ty  to -group  thetens  of thousands  of nouns  of our  d ic t ionary  f rom the great ly  vary ingTI -~T points of view, keeping in mind the main question of "with 3 - without3 Thus ,  the two examples  quoted above were  used  to i l l us t ra te  thepoint that the appearance  of the " j"  e lement  could not depend d i rect ly  onthe f inal  consonant :  in the f i r s t  pa i r  of examples  both s tems ended in "k"and in the second in "m" ;  it could not even depend on the f inal consonantgroup,  because  in the second pa i r  of examples  ' " ' j "  - not " j " "  waspreceded by " lm"  in both cases ;  bu~, of course ,  we never the less  had sucha sor t ing  made.
The invest igat ion  of the ful l  noun stock of the d ic t ionary  ind i f ferent  combinat ions  led to  the fol lowing conc lus ion:  the seeming lyrhapsod ic  appearance  or  omiss ion  of " j "  can eas i ly  be explained if wesuppose  that the Hungar ian  language as a natura l  code is s t ruc tured  in sucha way that automat ic  ana lys i s  can be car r ied  out us ing  a min imal  vocabu lary .Concretely: if the non-possessive stem is typical and "well-formed" fromthe viewpoint of the whole vocabulary-, i~.e.
if it has a frequently occurringend, the "j" element does not appear a f te r - i~nthe  possessive form; andthe other way round: where the stem would not b~-e r.~ognized automaticallybecause it has a rare ending and therefore the bare 'ra/e~' ending would belinked automatically with the stem, "j" emerges, so to say, ~..order tostop this and to emphasize the end of  the bare stem.
Thus in the ~t  pairof examples quoted above "j" did not appear after the bare final "k" bemusethis is frequent for the end of stems in Hungarian; whereas "j" appearedafter the "bad" "ck" group, which is not a typical stem end in Hungarian.Our second pair of examples is also subjected to the same rule, although ina s l ight ly  d i f ferent  way: the word  t f i re lme did not requ i re  " j"  because  aEMPIRICAL DATA AND AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS 303typ ica l  change  of the s tem of a p roduct ive  Hungar ian  su f f ix  i s  h idden in it(the bare  nominat ive  is  t f i re lem,  here  the s tem was  automat ica l l yemphas ized  by the t l i re le 'm~lm-  oppos i t ion) ,  whereas  f i lm j  _e requ i red  aspec ia l  denotat ion  of the s tem by " j " ,  there  be ing no X f i lem/ f i lm oppos i t ion ,It must  be added that  the behav iour  of su f f i xes  was  d iagnost i c  f rom ourpoint  of v iew.
If the suff ix is p roduct ive ,  there  is no  "j" a f ter  it; if it isnot  p roduct ive  o r  it is not  a nomina l  suff ix but e .g .
an  ad ject iva l  one  andis used  w i th  a noun on ly  occas iona l ly ,  the appearance  of "j" is more  orless  necessary .
It is "more  or  less"  so because  it represents  thel inguist ic man i fes ta t ion  of a regu lar i ty  that is p rac t i ca l l y  a statist ical one ;what  the severa l  examples  of instabi l i ty and  para l le l  fo rms  are  exp la ined  byis that the l inguist ic  inst inct is not a computer ,  it is not  a lways  poss ib lefor  a who le  communi ty  to dec ide  unequ ivoca l ly  whether  a stern end  isf requent  o r  ra re ,  whether  a suff ix is p roduct ive  o r  not.
F rom this point  ofv iew the behav iour  of the d i f ferent  h i s to r i co -e tymolog ica l  s t ra ta  ischaracter i s i t i c .
The  nearer  we  move towards  the younger  loanwords  theTI N more  f requent ly  "j" appears :  a loanword  often has  a wrong  , "a typ ica l "end.
But,  of course ,  we  can  on ly  say  "more  f requent ly" ,  "in many  cases" ,etc.
: e .g.
af ter  a g reat  number  of words  end ing  in the eas i ly  percept ib le-urn, -(t) -or had  been  bor rowed f rom Lat in,  they  gradua l ly  became "good" ,i.e.
recogn izab le  and  so they  did not  necessar i l y  have  to take  the spec ia ls ign  ,\] .
A s imi la r  phenomenon can  a lso  be observed  w i th  compound words .A root  word  hav ing  a "wrong"  end  requ i res  "j" - but if it is of ten used  asthe second par t  of a compound,  it becomes  someth ing  like a suffix, *'webare  got used  to it" at the ends  of cornpounds  and  this is why  the "j" wil lsoo'ner d i sappear  f rom there .
Th is  is eas i ly  not i ceab le  even  on  the bas i s  ofa s imp le  reverse  a lphabet i zed  list, as  the root  word  of ten hav ing  amorp!~.o logica l  code  w i th  H j,, s tands  in the first p lace  there  and  it isi r r lmediate ly  fo l lowed by the compounds  in wh ich  this root  word  is thesecond part ,  and  in roany  cases  its code  has  a l ready  no  "j".
(NB.
when thecod ing  was  go ing  on  this regu lar i ty  was  not even  guessed  at, so thistheoret i ca l  cons iderat ion  cou ld  not  have  in f luenced  the coders ,  in the caseof root  words  they  were  compe l led  to take  over  the cor respond ing  code  ofthe source  d ic t ionary .
O f  course ,  no  one  cou ld  see  these  compounds  in onegroup  be fore  the pub l i ca t ion  of the reverse  a lphabet i zed  d ic t ionary!
)A l l  this, however ,  was  noth ing  more  than  a p laus ib le  hypothes is  suppor tedby  ev idence  f rom the d ic t ionary .
Its rea l  conf i rmat ion  cou ld  be  ach ieved  bythe s tudy  of texts.
Reverse  a lphabet i zed  concordances  based  on  Hungar ianl inguist ic mater ia l  a f ford a very  good  oppor tun i ty  to do  this.2.
For  the last coup le  of years  a number  of normal  and  reversea lphabet i zed  concordances  have  been  made at the L.  Kossuth  Un ivers i ty  onthe bas i s  of Eng l i sh ,  F rench ,  Swah i l i  and  main ly  Hungar ian  and  Russ iantexts.

P roper ly  made concordances  f rom texts in d i f ferent  natura ll anguages  have  features  of the i r  own.
Thus ,  it is c lear  that a normalSwah i l i  concordance  works  the o ther  way  round in the sense  that themater ia l  is d iv ided  into d i f ferent  g roups  accord ing  to the grammat ica lind ices;  that in a F rench  concordance  \[~ is not exped ient  to pr int  runn ingwords  cons is t ing  of th ree  or  fewer  letters.
These  techn ica l  deta i ls  wi l l  notbe  d i scussed  here ,  we  or:ly note  thai in Hungar ian  concordances  ~he art ic le"a"  wh ich  mah=es  up  a co~nparat ive ly  h igh  percent  of runn ing  words  in the304 F. PAPPd i f fe rent  s ty l i s t i c  s t ra ta  has  been left  out of cons iderat ion .2.1.
Hav ing  made a reverse  a lphabet i zed  concordance  f rom Hungar iannewspaper  texts  cons is t ing  of approx imate ly  26 thousand runn ing  words  wecan ar r ive  at the  fo l lowing conc lus ions .
Of the 64 phonemes  incontemporary  Hungar ian  on ly  49 ac tua l ly  occur  at the  ends  of words ,  hal fof a l l  the  word  ends  be ing  occup ied  by the f i r s t  f ive ot these  (thepercentage  number  of  these  phonemes  and the i r  occur rence  at the  ends  ofwords  in our  mater ia l :  / t /  13, / k /  12, /n /  9, / s /  9, /a /  7).
As  it wi l l  beproved  in the  next  sec t ion  - a compar i son  of th i s  wi th  Russ ian  data  - th i sd iv i s ion  shows  a s i tuat ion  very  s imi la r  to that  in Russ ian .
One shou ld  saythe agg lu t inat ive  character  of Hungar ian  becomes  c lear  w i th in  th i s  f rom thequant i ta t ive  point  of v iew:  w i th in  the  d i f fe rent  f ina l  phonemes  la rge  b lockswith the same long agg lu t inat ive  end ing  group  can be seen .
Thus ,  18 % ofa l l  words  end ing  in / t /  a re  made up by those  end ing  in /e t /  (non-possess iveacc .
s ing .
; verbs  3 rd  pets .

,  10 % by those  end ing  in /~t /  (possess iveacc .

; the  end/k /  has  f ina l  g roups ,  somet imes  conta in ing  as  many  as  th ree  phonemes:/nak /  and /nek / ,  each  tak ing  up 11% (dat.
/gen ,  verb  3 rd pers .
p lu ra l ) ;the  same can be observed  with the  end /n / :  (ban) - (ben) (32 % a l together  -iness iv )  and so on.
A l l  th i s  suggests  that  morpho log ica l  ana lys i s  inHungar ian  shou ld  be s ta r ted  at the  ends  of words :  much  use fu l  g rammat ica lin fo rmat ion  is  concent ra ted  there .
These  f ina l  c lus ters  of two, th ree  or  fourphonemes ,  of course ,  a re  not complete ly  homogeneous ,  but the  number  ofwords  to be ana lysed  in another  way is  ins ign i f i cant .
Thus ,  e .g .
the  acc .s ing.

It was  found that  of a l l  the words  end ing  in /a /  11% ended in/ ja /  ma in ly  owing  to th i s  possess ive  fo rm,  whereas  the words  end ing  in / je /d id not make  up 3 % of those  end ing  in /e / :  both the contemporaryHungar ian  vocabu lary  and the  contemporary  texts  wi th  the i r  f requent  /a /  endand less  f requent  /e /  end wil l  sooner  requ i re  the spec ia l  denotat ion  of  theend of the  s tem with / j /  immedia te ly  be fore  the /a / .
Other  Hungar ian  textsp resented  a very  s imi la r  p ic ture  of the  d iv i s ion  of f ina l  phonemes ,espec ia l l y  concern ing  /a/-/e/ at the  ends  of words .
Thus ,  e .g .
there  wasnot a s ing le  noun wi th  the end ing  / je /  in th i s  possess ive  forn~ among thethousands  of nouns  of the  approx imate ly  20 000 runn ing  words  of "To ld i "(an epic poem wr i t ten  by J~nos  Arany  in the midd le  of  the  las t  century ) ;  itgoes  wi thout  say ing  that  at the same t ime a number  of them took theend ings  /a / ,  / j a /  and /e /  in th i s  g rammat ica l  fo rm:  the var ious  possess ivefo rms  in the i r  sum tota l  p roved  to be even  more  product ive  than  the p lu ra lones .
(By the way,  a l l  th i s  tes t i f i es  that  Hungar ian  texts  can  be cons ideredto have  been "contemporary"  f rom th i s  point  of v iew s ince  at leas t  themidd le  of  the  las t  century .
)EMPIRICAL DATA AND AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS 305Concern ing  ana lys i s  let  us  make  one more  essent ia l  remark  in connect ionwith the  / ja /  ending.
Forms l ike barack ja  'h i s /her  apr i co t '  can a l ready  bewel l  d i f fe rent ia ted  in the '  nomina l  dec lens ion ,  but the  same / ja /  end ing  hasc reated  a new homonymy at the  ends  of words :  the  3 rd person  s ingu larfo rms  of  ve la r  verbs  take  the same end ing  in the i r  ob jec t ive  con jugat ion :e .g .
th i s  fo rm of the  verb  v~g ' to  cut '  i s  v~gja  'he /she  cuts  ( i t ) ' .
Thepro~inence  of  the  / ja /  end ing  can  be exp la ined  by th i s  fact  as  we l l ,  wh ichat the  same t ime makes  our  ev idence  weaker :  in the  case  of pa la ta l  harmonythere  is  another  end ing  (cf.
n~z "to look a t ' :  n~zi  'he /she  looks  at (it)' andnot the  expectab le  Xn~zje o r~meth ing  l ike th i s -~.
The  whole  morpho logy  ofHungar ian ,  however ,  is  dominated  by a par t i cu la r  feature :  namely  that  nod i f fe rence  i s  made between the par ts  of speech:  the  /m/  at the ends  ofwords  re fe rs  to the  f i r s t  person  of verbs ,  nouns ,  p ronouns ,  etc.
; the /k /re fe rs  to some kind of  p lu ra l .
Th i s ,  of  course ,  makes  morpho log ica l  ,ana lys i s  based  on the word end more  di f f icu l t :  how pract i ca l  it i s  to knowthat  in Russ ian  end ings  conta in ing  the e lement  /y /  (ye, ~:.x, Z_~_~, etc.
)be long to an ad jec t ive ;  that  the  overwhe lming  major i ty  of verba l  word  ends(e._~', e t ,  em,  ete,  e tc . )
is  charater i s t i c  only  of verbs ,  etc.
(It i sin te res t ing  to note  that  Eng l i sh ,  a language with an ext remely  poor  sys temof end ings  and hard ly  comparab le  with Hungar ian  f rom th i s  point  of v iew,shows  a s imi la r  ind i f fe rence  towards  par ts  of speech  and even grammat ica lmean ing :  it i s  on ly  the  s imp le  / s /  that  fo rms  the  pl.ural of nouns ,  the  3 rdperson  s ingu lar  of verbs  and even the gen i t ive  of nouns ;  such  a po lysemy,of , course ,  could hard ly  be imag ined  in Hungar ian .

Here are the five most frequent final phonemes of "Onegin" containingabout 22 000 running words, the percentage number is indicated inbrackets :  / j /  (10), / i /  (10\], /a /  (9), /o /  (8), /e /  (8); 45 % of the  runn ingwords  end in one of t-hese phonemes .
Wi th in  the most  f requent  word  ends ,however ,  one can  f ind fewer  f ina l  pa i r s  (not to speak  of t r ip le ts  o rquadrup le ts ) ,  and what  i s  impor tant  is  that  if an end ing  can s t i l l  bebrought  into prominence ,  it can  bear  many  var ious  and incoherent  funct ions .Thu~, e .g .
in th i s  mater ia l  the word  end /e j /  makes  up more  than  onef i f th of a l l  the  480 runn ing  words  end ing  in / j / .
Wi th in  the  l im i ts  of th i smater ia l  the  fo l lowing propor t ions  have  been s ta ted  (100 = 480): 1. p ronounsl ike ej ,  se j ,  vse j  (48 %), 2. gos te j - type  gen i t ive  p lu ra l  (14 %), 3. pos ledne j- type ad jec t iva l  fo rms  (10 T0), 4. no~e j - type  gen i t ive  p lu ra l  (10 %), 5.l en ive j - type  comparat ive  fo rms  (8 %), and so on.
The  remain ing  10 T0 arespread  over  a dozen funct ions  (par ts  of speech ,  g rammat ica l  cases ,  moodsof verbs ,  etc,  ).
It shou ld  be noted that  none of the  most  f requent  f ivetypes  enumerated  here  is  homogeneous  f rom the point  of v iew ofg rammat ica l  ana lys i s ,  cf.

Some of the  more  " fo r tunate  rr end ings  as  1j , mayhave  only  hal f  as  many  funct ions ,  but even in th i s  case  the mass  ofempi r i ca l  data  y ie lded  by a reverse  a lphabet i zed  concordance  may beind ispensab le  to make  the ana lys ing  a lgory thm as  exact  and e legant  asnecessary .2.

It was  qu i te  c lear ,  even in the  ear ly  s tages  of mechan ica l  t rans la t ion ,that  the  separab le  Hungar ian  verba l  p re f ixes  would present  a spec ia l  p rob lemfor  the  ana lys i s .
(Thus ,  the  very  f i r s t  s tep  of the very  f i r s t  Hungar ian -Russ ian  MT-a lgory thm in word - f ind ing  was  the search  fo r  verba l  p re f ixesthat  might  have  been separated ,  cf.
Me l '~uk  1958, 231. )
Accord ing  to the306 F. PAPPtes t imony  of the concordances ,  this p rob lem is rare,  though it does  existstructural ly and cannot  be neglected.
In the newspaper  concordancement ioned  above,  not more  than 362 "separated"  verba l  pref ixes have  beenfound, hard ly  less than 1,5 % of all the runn ing  words .
Fur ther ,  therewere  only five (m_.m~_, el, ki, tel, be) of about fifty possib le verba l  pref ixesthat occured  separate ly  in three quar ters  of all these cases.Normal  concordances  also prov ide  r ich mater ia l  for p rob lems of wordorder  of separab le  verba l  prefixes, negat ion etc., i.e.
the topicalization ofHungar ian  sentences.
(Topical izat ion is of the u tmost  impor tance  f rom thev iewpoint  of the analysis  of Hungar ian  sentences,  cf.
