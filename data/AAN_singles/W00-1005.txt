The analysisis used to address questions of the role ofprosody in dialogue while taking intoaccount he complexities of multispeakerdiscourse.
We address somemethodological concerns of how best tocarry out a study of this kind as well asour theoretical questions about he formalidentification of dialogue structures atlevels higher than the micro-level of'dialogue act', or 'move'.IntroductionThis paper eports ome of the results from ourresearch into the relationship between prosodicstructure and discourse structure in dialogue.One of our particular interests i how to identifyand analyse relevant prosodic parameters inmulti-speaker discourse.
We have beenexamining the kinds of dialogue structureframeworks that best account for patterns ofprosodic phenomena; nd conversely, the typesof dialogue structure that exhibit prosodicregularities.
Our research domain is hurnamhuman atural dialogue Settings but our questionsare equally relevant o researchers working onsystems for more naturalistic human-computerinterfaces, as well as those developing betterautomated systems for annotating large speechcorpora.The main methodological considerationsassociated with our current work are:a) how natural dialogues can be reliablyannotated to allow independent comparisonsand correlations of prosodic and structuralfeatures,b) the identification and classification of unitsof dialogue that reflect the 'joint action'feature of interactive discourse (ie.
that bothparticipants in a dialogue contribute todialogue structure (Clark 1992, 1996), anaspect of dialogue that fundamentallydifferentiates it from monologic discourse).These issues will be addressed in this paperusing data from a corpus of naturally producedspoken dialogue taken from the Australian MapTask corpus (Millar et al1994).
Here we havefocussed on the process of grounding, theassignment of utterances to 'common groundunits' (CGUs - Nakatani & Traurn 1999) and theinternal structure of these units, as a means ofillustrating some of the problems that bothmethodological issues raise.
We show howsome of these problems might be overcome byfocussing on sequences of initiating andresponding (typically grounding) contributionswithin CGUs, as a site for prosodic analysis,rather than on the boundaries of the units as awhole (cf.
Stiding et al2000a).
This approachthus preserves the notion that one can identify'chunks' of dialogue in which particular types ofinformation are acknowledged as being in thecommon ground of both participants, whileremaining true to the dynamic nature of thegrounding negotiation.1.
Background1.1.
Prosody and Discourse StructureMost.
empirical work examining prosody indiscourse has focussed on its function inmonologue (eg.
Swerts 1997, Nakatani et al1995, Hirchberg & Nakatani 1996).
Thesestudies have found that a range of acousticparameters associated with prosody, such asfinal lengthening and type of boundary tone, aregood indicators of the boundaries betweendifferent discourse units at micro and macrolevels of discourse structure.More recently, there has been an interest inexamining how prosody may be used in dialogueto signal discourse structure in that domain.Shriberg et al(1998) showed that variousprosodic cues (duration, F0, pause length andspeaking rate) were relevant for the automaticclassification of dialogue 'acts'.
Stifling et al(2000b) similarly showed strongcorrespondences between the boundaries ofdialogue acts and prosodic phenomena such aspitch reset and intonational phrase boundaries(represented as ToBI 'break indices').
Butdialogue acts are the 'parts' of dialogue mostakin with structural elements of monologicdiscourse, since each 'act' can be analysed asindependent utterances by a single speaker.Higher levels of dialogue structure necessarilyinvolve some interactive 'chunk' of the discourseto which both participants in the dialoguecontribute some speech.So while it is clear that prosody serves to delimitdialogue acts, and to some extent distinguishbetween them (eg.
Shriberg et al1998, Koiso etal 1998, Stifling et al2000b), the questionremains whether prosody is also a reliableindicator of dialogue structure at higher levels(analogous with the higher levels of monologicdiscourse structure described in Swerts (1997),Nakatani et al (1995), and others) and to whatuses are prosodic phenomena put in the contextof higher levels of dialogue structure.1.2 Grounding and Common Ground UnitsGrounding is the process by which informationcontributed by participants in interaction istakento have entered the 'common ground', or mutualknowledge of the participants (Clark & Schaefer1989, Clark 1996, Traum 1994).
The process ofgrounding requires that one participantcontributes something to the discourse(minimally, a dialogue act), and that the otherparticipant make some indication that thecontribution has been heard and accepted as acontribution (though not necessarily understood).This 'indication' may be a verbalacknowledgment (or some other kind of verbalresponse) or it may be some kind of non-verbalcomrnlmicative act (like head nods, facialexpression and other gestures).Traum (1998) and Nakatani & Traum (1999)have recently proposed taking grounding as thebasic principle behind the structuring of dialogueat levels ligher than the dialogue act.
Minimalunits of acknowledged common ground havebeen considered as the building blocks of higherlevel dialogue structures based on intentional orinformational content (eg.
'Common GroundUnits', or 'CGUs' Nakatani & Traum (1999)).CGUs, which represent grounding at the'illocutionary level' (Clark 1996), have beenproposed as a meso-level dialogue structure -roughly the same level that dialogue games(Carletta et al 1997) or adjacency pairs (eg.37Sinclair & Coulthard 1975) occupy in theirdialogue structure frameworks.The appeal of taking units basexl on grounding asthe level of dialogue structure above themicrolevel of 'act' (as argued in Nakatani &Traurn 1999) lies in its pfiofitization of mutualunderstanding as a central component ofdialogue, regardless of the type of initiation andresponse.
In the 'CGU' fiamework, someresponses themselves get grounded so that theresult is a complex configuration of overlappingand embedded units of information entered intothe common ground of the participants.
Thisapproach thus acknowledges importance of theconlributions by both participants in thegrounding process.
It highlights the 'joint action'aspect of dialogic ommunication.Evaluation of the coding of CGUs in dialogue bythe Discourse Resource Initiative (Core et al1999) showed a low degree of intercoderreliability, especially for those coding the HCRCMap Task corpus (Anderson et al1991).
Someof the inconsistencies across coders wereattributed to "iraonation and ~rfing" (p. 61), aswell as to difficulties in coding different types ofacknowledgments.
Some proposals for theclassification of acknowledgments were made(Core et al1999) and Stirling et al(2000a) havenoted some parameters along Which CGUs mightbe further classified.The ways that his classification has been refinedand utilised for the cun, ent paper are described insection 2 (methods), where we also describe oursystem of annotation for both prosodic and CGUproperties of the dialogues, and explain ourmethod for utilising this annotation for the currentanalysis.
In section 3 we present some results ofour investigation fprosody and grounding in thelight of the methodological issues listed above.These results will be used in section 4 to addressthe following theoretical questions, as well as toset the agenda for future research into prosodiccorrelates of dialogue structure:a) can prosody be used as a heuristic foridentifying dialogue structure above the levelof the 'dialogue act'?b) does the process of 'grounding' have anyformal basis, prosodic or otherwise,independent of the identification of dialogueacts?2.
Methods2.1 Annotation MethodsOur corpus consists of 4 dialogues from theMAP TASK section of the Australian NationalDatabase of Spoken Language - ANDOSL(Millar et al 1994).
This corpus is closelymodelled on the HCRC Map Task (Anderson etal 1991).
Participants worked in pairs, each witha map in front of them that the other could notsee.
One participant ( he 'instruction-giver' IG)had a route marked on their map and wasrequired by the task to instruct he other (the'instruction-follower' IF) in drawing the correctroute onto their own map.
The maps weresimilar, but differed in the presence, position andnames of certain of the landmarks.
Each pair ofparticipants participated in two dialogues,swapping roles of instruction-giver andinstruction-follower, and thus producing a firsttime and second time attempt at the task.The four dialogues used here were from twopairs of participants: the two dialogues from apair 'Known' to one another, differing in whichparticipant took the role of instruction-giver, andthe two dialogues from a pair 'Unknown' to oneanother, also differing in which participant tookthe role of instruction-giver.
In each case, thepairs Were mixed-gender.
The dialogues werechosen randomly and the speakers belonged tothe General Australian English dialectal grouping.The pre-recorded dialogues were copied fromCD and digitised for analysis at 22 kHz usingEntropic's ESPS/ Waves + speech analysissoftware running on a Sun workstation in thePhonetics Laboratory of the UniversiW ofMelbourne.
A complete orthographictranscription fthe dialogues was carried out.. .
.

_ -  -38The prosodic featu_es of the dialogues werelabelled on separate tiers using the ToBI (Toneand Break Indices) prosodic transcriptionconventions for Australian English, detailed inFletcher & Harrington (1996), closely modelledon the criteria developed for American Englishintonation (Beckman & Ayers Elam 1994/1997).The dialogues were prosodically annotated forbreak indices (degree of juncture) and phraseand boundary tones according to ToBIconventions using the Xwaves label function.The dialogues were also aunota~ed on separatetiers in Xwaves for the timing features of pauselocation and duration (in ms), and overlaplocation and duration (in ms) i.
These featureswere noted with respect to preceding andfollowing talk.The features of break index, phrase andboundary tones and pause and overlapphenomena were selected to address the'intonation and timing' problems that were raisedby the Discourse Resource Initiative (Core et al1999), and because related work in conversationanalysis has demonstrated the importance ofintonation (especially final contours) to beingable to account for the meaning ofacknowledgments in interaction (eg.
Mffller1996, Gardner 1998).Break Indices (BI) were labelled as follows: 4(full intonation phrase boundary); 3 (intermediateintonation phrase boundary); 3p (disfluentintermediate intonation phrase boundary).Boundary tones were labelled as follows: H-H%for a high rising tone (131 4); L-L% for a fallingor low tone (BI 4); I.-H% for a low rising tone(BI 4); H-L% for a mid-level tone (131 4); H- fora high intermediate phrase boundary (BI 3), I.-for a low intermediate phrase boundary (BI 3).The pause and overlap labelling allowed us toextract information about the timing of eachspeaker contribution with respect to the previousand following contributions to the talk.
Withrespect to the preceding talk, contributions wereanalysed as having a pause before (pb), partiallyoverlapping with the preceding conlribution (olb),completely overlapping (ol), no pause or overlapwith the preceding unit (or 'latch' - lb), or'continued" (if the previous contribution was bythe same speaker without an interceding pause(c)).
With respect to the following talk,contributions were analysed as having a pauseafter (pa), partially overlapping with the followingcontribution (ola), completely overlapping (ol), nopause or overlap with following contribution (orlatch - la), or 'continued' (if the next contributionwas by the same speaker without an intercedingpause (c)).
Table 1 provides a summary of thelabels used for prosodic and timing phenomena.Table 1: Prosodic and Timing LabelsBreak Phrase andIndex BoundaryTones433pH-H%L-L%L-H%H-L%H-L-Timing(previousta )pbo\]bolCTiming(followingtan0paoholhSince the major goal of our research was toinvestigate associations between prosodicphenomena nd discourse structure, we codeddiscourse categories independently from dividingthe speech signal into prosodic units and thecoding of prosodic phenomena (these parameterswere coded by different researchers).The dialogues were annotated for CommonGround Units, following Nakatani & Tram(1999).
ii The coding was carried out by tworesearchers independently who then collaboratedon a consensual version for each dialogue.
Thecodes were entered on separate tiers in ESPS/Waves +, separated according to which speakergave which contribution.
This meant thatinitiations and endpoints of CGUs werenumbered and aligned with the speaker whobegan and ended each unit.
Within each CGUwe also coded the first 'response' by the otherparticipant, which typically established either thatthe initial information was entered into thecommon ground, or that further negotiation wasrequired in order to ground the information.
In39this paper, we only considered CGUs thatcontained fully grounded infi3rrnafion at theirclose (ie.
we did not include abandoned ordiscontinuous CGUs - see Nakatani & Traum1999).
In Stifling et al(2000a) we reported onsome of the prosodic characteristics of the finalunit in CGUs (break indices and turn boundariesonly).
Here we report on the prosodiccharacteristics of the initiation move of the CGUand the prosodic profile of this first respondingcontribution.2.2.
Classification of CGUsWe go a step further than Nakatanl & Traum(1999) and Stirling et al(2000a) in furtherclassifying CGUs in terms of the internalcharacteristics of the grounding process -whether they consisted of a 'simple' exchangeof initiating move and responding move, orwhether their structure involved morecontributions (by either speaker) before the CGUin question was considered to be complete (ie.the information was acknowledged as enteredinto the common ground).
The former type wecalled 'Simple' CGUs, while the latter type wecalled 'Complex' CGUs.
Complex CGUs werefurther classified into four types based onpragmatic and sequential criteria, as follows:a) Overlapping CGUs, where the groundingelement of one unit was itself grounded withsome verbal acknowledgment in the nextCGU, as in (1) below.b) CGUs which consisted of furtheracknowledgment(s) by the other speakersubsequent to the first grounding element, asin (2) below.c) CGUs which contained more than oneacknowledgment by the same speaker (as in(3) below)d) CGUs which negotiated information atdifferent levels of communication lower thanthe 'illocutionary' level (eg.
the level of'presentation' or 'locution' (Clark 1996)),and were therefore considered part of alarger CGU which was gounded at the levelofillocution, as in (4) below.

In overlapping CGUs, the second'response" functions to ground the first response.In multiple acknowledgment CGUs, the secondresponse is not analysed as 'grounding', but isnevertheless some kind of filrtheracknowledgment (either by the same speaker orby the other speaker).
In the final case ofcomplex CGUs, the first response is a signal thatperhaps ome part of the initial contribution hadnot entered into the eomrnon gound and thatfurther collaboration was required.
'~These categories are not claimed to representthe only way that CGUs can be classified (el.Core et al1999).
Nevertheless they provide uswith a useful basis for addressing differences inthe role of prosody in CGUs.40Altogether there were 419 CGUs in the corpus.Of these, 241 were 'simple' CGUs and 178were 'complex'.
Of the 178 complex CGUs, 47(26%) were 'overlapping', 59 (33%) containedmultiple acknowledgment by both participants, 52(29%) contained multiple acknowledgements bythe same speaker, and 20 (1 I%) contained morecomplex negotiations of understanding untilacknowledgment of mutual understanding of theinitial dialogue act was reached (the level atwhich CGUs were delineated).We hypothesised that since, on our definition,complex CGUs differed from the simple type interms of the structure of their response 'phase',rather than in terms of their initiation phase, thereshould be no difference between simple andcomplex CGUs with respect o the timing andprosodic profile of initiations.
However, wepredicted that there might be quantitativelyrecognisable properties of the first response incomplex CGUs which motivated their expansion,and that these would be different from thosefound in simple CGUs.
While we expected thatthese 'recognisable' properties would involve acombination of grammatical, pragmatic andprosodic properties, here we were onlyinterested in the extent to which simple andcomplex CGUs could be differentiated onprosodic grounds.In order to check these hypotheses, we pooledthe four dialogues and compared initiation andfirst response contributions in simple andcomplex CGUs for each of the four parametersidentified above (BI, boundary tone, timing(before) and timing (after)).
Chi square testswere carried out on each of these comparisonsto determine which sets of parameters displayedsignificant variation between simple CGUs andcomplex CGUs.
The results are presented in thefollowing section.3.
ResultsChi square tests on the combined totals of allCGUs showed highly significant differences(p<0.001) between initiations and responses forall four prosodic and timing parameters.
Thisresult is consistent with those reported in Stirlinget al(2000b), where it was shown that initiationtype dialogue acts could be prosodicallydifferentiated from response type dialogue acts.Here we were more interested inthe question ofwhether the complexity of the CGU was alsoreflected in initiation and response contributions.The results reported in the following subsectionstherefore refer to the percentage number ofeach prosodic and timing parameter as aproportion of the CGU type (percentages are inboldface) - the total number of simple CGUs orthe total number of complex CGUs - forinitiations and responses independently.3.1 Correspondences with Break IndicesTable 2: Initiations (CGU type x BI)BI4 BD BI3p No BI TotalSimple 227 7 5 2 241CGUs 94.2 2.9 2.1 0.8 100Complex 165 4 9 0 178CGUs 92.7 2.3 5.0 0 100392 11 14 2 419Total 93.6 2.6 3.3 0.5 100Z 2 (dr=3, N=419) = 2.81, NSTable 3: Responses (CGU type x BI)BI4 BI3 BI3p No BI TotalSimple 161 53 2 25 241CGUs 66.8 22.0 0.8 10.4 100Complex 145 18 2 13 178CGUs 81.5 10.1 1.1 7.3 100Total 306 71 4 38 41973.0 16.9 1.0 9.1 100Z 2 (dr=3, N--419) = 12.69, p<0.01As expected, there was no significant differencebetween simple and complex CGUs with respectto their initiation contribution break indices.Examination of the first res~nse of these unitsdid show a significant difference between simple41and complex CGUs with respect to breakindices.
In particular, the first responses forsimple CGUs had a high proportion of BI3(corresponding with an intermediate phraseboundary) compared with complex CGUs and arelatively low proportion of BI4 (correspondingwith a full intonation phrase).
That is, the firstresponse contribution of a complex CGU wasmore likely to end with a full inttonafional phraseboundary (BI4) than the first responsecontribution of a simple CGU.3.2 Correspondences with Boundary TonesTable 4: Initiations (CGU type x tones)H- L- L- H-H% L% H% L% H- L- No TotSimpl 82 71 72 4 4 3 5 241e 43.

6.2 6.7 9.6 10 1007 9 4Z 2 (dr--6, N-419) = 17.23, p<0.01In contrast with the results for BI reportedabove, there were significant differences foundbetween simple and complex CGUs forboundary tones in both initiation and responsecontributions.
With respect to initiatingcontributions, a higher proportion of low falling(L-L%) boundary tones (42.1% vs. 29.5%) anda lower proportion of low rising (L-H%)boundary tones (18.5% vs. 29.9%) were foundin the complex CGUs, compared with simpleCGUs.
Proportions of high rising (H-H%)boundary tones were not significantly differentand there were proportionally few instances ofother types of contours.Like initiation conlributions, the results forresponse contributions also show a higherproportion of low falling tones in complex CGUsthan in simple CGUs (30.3% cf.
17.5%).
Theproportions of both high rising and low risingtones appears table across the types of CGUshowever.The numbers of response contn'butions whichhad other types of boundary tones (including noboundary tone) were much higher than thosefound for initiating units.
This was expected,since responses to initiation units were typicallyacknowledgments of grounding (like 'okay' or'yeh'), which were then followed by other talkby the same speaker continuing an intonationalphrase.
The higher proportion of such 'non-final' contours (H-L%, L-, H- and none) forsimple CGUs than complex CGUs reflects a setof instances in which the respondent answers ayes-no question, and then makes a furtherresponse in the same intonational phrase thatis new information which was itself grounded(and was therefore coded as a new CGU).These non-final contours typically alsocorresponded with break indices of less than 4,accounting for the relatively high proportion ofBI3s in responses in complex CGUs (noted inthe previous ection).3.3.

In particular,there was a relatively high proportion ofresponses in complex CGUs whose onsetoccurred while the other speaker was stilltalking, resulting in an overlap (18.5% vs. 7.5%).When the first response in a CGU is at leastpartially overlapping with the initiationcontribution, it creates an environment in whichboth participants must work harder (ie.
makemore contributions) in order for theacknowledgment of common groundedriess to beclear.
At least some of these overlaps resultedin the same speaker repeating anacknowledgment of grounding with no overlap,as in example (3) above.
However, they alsoresulted in complex CGUs of the other kinds.3.3.2.

However, theasymmetry in overlapping found in the precedingset of the results did not occur when oneconsidered the contribution foUowing the firstresponse.
In this case, the category whichshowed the greatest degree of differencebetween simple and complex CGUs was thecategory of 'latch' (22.5% vs. 12%), where thesecond speaker timed his/her next turn to followfrom the target contribution without any pause oroverlap.
Responses in complex CGUs showed ahigher proportion of latching with the followingcontribution.
This high proportion of latching isperhaps an indication of a smooth transition fromfirst response to timber grounding contributionswithin the CGU.4.
D iscuss ionThe results show that for three of theparameters investigated (break index, timingbefore and after the target contribution), therewas little or no variation according to the type ofCGU that the contribution initiated (simple orcomplex).
This finding was consistent with ourhypothesis that if there were any measurabledifferences between these CGU types, theywould be found in the first response contn'butionof the CGU, and not in its initiation contn'bution.Also consistent with our hypothesis was theresult that all four prosodic and .timing43parameters displayed differences betweensimple and complex CGUs in the first responsecontribution.
Complex CGUs displayed moreoverlapped first responses, fi~wer incompleteintonation phrases (131 of less; than 4) and ahigher proportion of low falling boundary tonesthan the response contributions of simple CGUs.Explanations for some of these results wereprovided in the previous section, but furtheranalysis is required before we can really gain anaccurate picture of the formal profile of complexCGUs (cf.
simple CGUs).
In particular, werequire an analysis of the different types ofcomplex CGUs to determine whether theydisplay formal regularities.
It 1nay be that onlyone or two types of complex CGUs arecontributing to the patterns observed here.
Suchan analysis is planned in future work.
We alsoplan to conduct a similar study that takes intoaccount he dialogue act type of initiation andfirst responses to determine more extensively thefull range of factors which influence intonationpatterns and the timing of contributions indialogue, ivOur results do confirm the necessity ofdeveloping strategies for the analysis of prosodyin dialogue that take into account he effects ofsequence.
Not only did initiation contributionsoverall behave differently to responsecontributions with respect to prosody and timing(a result which we did not address in detail here),but the responses themselves could also bedifferentiated based on whether they 'finished' aCGU, or whether they were tbllowed by othercontributions before grounding was achieved.Results such as these suggest hat with respectto the formal identification (c?
pragmaticidentification) of levels of dialogue structurehigher than the dialogue act, structures defined interms of sequential position, as such asadjacency pairs, might be more compatible withpatterns we have observed in our data.
The lowlevel of intercoder reliability for CGUs, asreported in Core et al(1999) also suggests thelack of readily identifiable tbrrnal properties.Even taking 'intonation and timing' into account,as we have done here, does not clearly point to aformal profile of CGUs independent ofsequences of dialogue acts.Empirical investigation\ of the role of prosody inmulti-speaker discourse is still in its infancy, andwe are still developing tools of analysis that freeus from looking only at those aspects of dialoguethat best mirror the structure of monologicdiscourse.
We have found that our method ofboth prosodic and discourse segment annotationin ESPS/Waves+ has provided us with the powerto develop this investigation further.
In futurework we will be able to easily incorporateadditional variables, such as dialogue acts,complex CGU type, and a range of otherprosodic phenomena into our analysis, whilekeeping track of the sequences in which thesejoint actions occur.ReferencesAnderson, A., Bader, M., Bard, E., Boyle, E., Doherty, G.Garrod, S., Isard, S., Kowtko, J., McAllister, J., Miller,J., Sofillo, C., Thompson, H. & Weinert, R.

Notes on dialogue structure.Unpublished ms, available fromhttp://www.cs.unad.edulusers/traum/DSD/.i Overlap location and duration could be measuredaccurately because the dialogues were recorded ondual channels.We also coded other features of dialogue structuresuch as dialogue acts.
See Stirling et al(2000b) formore details of that annotation method.The categories of complex CGUs were not allmutually exclusive.
For example, aCGU could containmultiple acknowledgments by both speakers.
~ncethese overlaps occurred infrequently, for thepurposes of  this paper we assigned each complexCGU to only one 'primary' classification.iv Such an analysis might for example, help provide anexplanation for why, contra to our expectations, theinitiation phases of complex CGUs showeddifferences in boundary tone phenomena from theinitiation phases of simple CGUs.45
