As a result, the mean-ings of expressions are more specific thanthose derived by using primitives.
We alsodesign an ontology to express the taxo-nomic relations between concepts and theattributes of concepts.
To establish thetaxonomic relations between word senses,we introduce a strategy that constructs theE-HowNet ontology automatically.
Wethen implement the lexical ontology as aWeb application1 to demonstrate the tax-onomy and the search functions for query-ing key-terms and E-HowNet expressionsin the lexicon, which contains more than88,000 lexical senses.1 IntroductionE-HowNet, an evolution and extension of HowNet(Dong & Dong, 2006), is an entity-relation rep-resentation model for lexical senses.
Under theframework, word senses are defined by basicconcepts as well as conceptual relations calledattribute-values.
The following is an example oflexical sense representation in E-HowNet.
(1) ??
?|carefully choose?
is expressed(or defined) by the expression ?{choose|??:manner={cautious|?
}}?.In the representation, the meaning of ????
iscomprised of two primitive concepts, ?choose|???
and ?cautious|?
?, and the conceptual rela-1available at http://ckip.iis.sinica.edu.tw/?wtchen/taxonomy/tion between the primitives is explained by the se-mantic role ?manner?.
For further details, readersmay refer to the E-HowNet technical report (CKIP2009).With a well-established entity-relation model,semantic composition is applicable from the mor-phological level to the sentential level in E-HowNet.
Semantic compositionality, togetherwith syntactic information, contributes enor-mously to natural language understanding.The remainder of this paper is organized asfollows.
We describe the major features of E-HowNet in Section 2 and introduce the E-HowNetontology in Section 3.
Then, we present our on-line E-HowNet system in Section 4.
Section 5contains some concluding remarks.To achieve the goal of semantic compositional-ity and to extend the advantage from HowNet, thefollowing features are implemented in E-HowNet.a) Multi-level definitions and semantic decom-position: Word senses (concepts) can be defined(expressed) by primitives as well as by any well-defined concepts and conceptual relations.
How-ever, using only primitives to express word senses,as in HowNet, causes information degradation andimportant ontological relations between conceptsmay be missed.b) Uniform sense representation and seman-tic compositionality: To achieve semantic com-positionality, it is necessary to encode the sensesof both content words and function words in auniform framework.
HowNet performs well fordefining content words, but it does not providea well-form representational framework for ex-pression the sense of function words, which in-dicate semantic relations.
In contrast, E-HowNet45provides uniform representations for the sensesof content/function words and the senses of sen-tences/phrases.
For example, the passive senseof the preposition ??
by?
introduces an agentrole (relation) and the conjunction ???
because?links the relation of reason between two events.The functional representation and semantic com-positionality are illustrated by the following ex-ample:(2) Because of the rain, the clothes are all wet.??????????
?Table 1: The function representation and semanticcompositionality for example sentenceWord POS E-HowNetDefinition??
Cb reason ={ }(conjunction)??
VA {rain|??
}(intransitive verb)??
Na {clothing|??
}(common noun)?
Da Quantity=(adverb) {complete|?}?
VH {wet|?
}(state verb)?
Ta aspect=(particle) {Vachieve|??
}Suppose that the following dependency struc-ture and semantic relations are derived by parsingsentence (2) as follows:(3) S(reason:VP(Head:Cb:??|dummy:VA:??)|theme:NP(Head:Na:??)
| quantity: Da:?
|Head:Vh:?|particle:Ta:?
)?The semantic composition in (4) is the result ofunifying the features of the lexical representationsshown in the above table.
The dependency daugh-ters have become feature attributes of the senten-tial head ?wet|??.
(4) def:{wet|?:theme={clothing|??},aspect={Vachieve|??},quantity={complete|?},reason={rain|??
}}.c) Taxonomy for both entities and relations: Toachieve automatic feature unification, E-HowNetorganizes entities and relations (attributes) in a hi-erarchical structure that relates entities taxonomi-cally.
Further details are provided in the next sec-tion.2 OntologyWe adopt and extend approximately 2,600 prim-itives from HowNet to form the top-level ontol-ogy of E-HowNet, which includes two types ofsubtrees: entities and relations.
The entities arecomprised of events, objects, and attribute-values;while the relations are comprised of semantic-roles and functions.
Entities indicate concepts thathave substantial content, whereas relations linkthe semantic relations between entities (Chen etal., 2004; Chen et al, 2005; Chen et al, 2005;Huang et al 2008).
The taxonomic structure is or-ganized by hypernym-hyponym relations; there-fore, it forms an inheritable system, i.e., the hy-ponym concepts inherit the properties of hyper-nym concepts.
The proposed approach facilitatesthe adoption of knowledge represented by otherframeworks, such as FrameNet, and HowNet; andit allows concepts to be represented with vary-ing degrees of specificity.
Another advantage isthat conceptual similarities can be modeled bytheir relational distances in the hierarchy (Resnik,1999), and the taxonomic relations between lexi-cal senses can be captured from their E-HowNetexpressions automatically.2.1 Automatic Construction of OntologyWith E-HowNet expressions, lexical senses aredefined as entities and relations.
Thus, all the tax-onomic relations of lexical senses can be iden-tified according to their E-HowNet definitions.Synonyms are identified by their identical E-HowNet expressions, and hyponymy relations areidentified by the subsumption of attribute-values.
(Note that only near-synonym classes are iden-tified due to the coarse-grained expressions ofthe lexical senses in the current version of E-HowNet.)
Furthermore, new categories are iden-tified by common attribute-values.
For instance,pandas and zebras can be categorized as animalswith the same feature: black and white markings.To construct a complete lexical taxonomy, we use46Figure 1: The E-HowNet ontology systema strategy that categorizes concepts automatically.Starting with a manually created top-level on-tology of primitive concepts, the following strat-egy classifies the lexicon into hierarchical sub-categories:(1) Attach lexical senses.
Words and associ-ated sense expressions are first attached to the top-level ontology nodes according to their head con-cepts.
For instance, the head concept of the ex-pression ?{choose|??:manner={cautious|?}}?is?choose|???.
(2) Sub-categorization by attribute-values.
Lex-ical concepts with the same semantic head are fur-ther sub-categorized according to their attribute-values.
Lexicons that have the same attribute-values share specific characteristics; therefore fur-ther sub-categorization is performed based on thedistinct attribute-values of the lexicons.
(3) Repeat step (2) if there are too many lexicalconcepts in one category.
Although the lexiconsare classified after step (2), some sub-categoriesmight still contain too many lexicons.
In thissituation, we further classify the lexicons in thesub-category with other attribute-values until allsub-categories contain fewer members than a pre-defined threshold, or all members of a categoryare synonyms.3 Overview of the On-line SystemThe current E-HowNet ontology is an on-line ver-sion of the automatically constructed taxonomicstructure of E-HowNet expressions, which con-tain more than 88,000 lexical senses.
This sec-tion provides an overview of the ontology and thefunctions of the on-line web browsing system.Figure 2: Key-Term Search BoxFigure 1 shows the E-HowNet ontology systemand tree structure.The tree structure of hyponymy relations al-lows users to browse the entire tree by expandingand hiding sub-trees.
Although the classificationstrategy enables the number of entities under eachnode to be limited and viewed easily, a more effec-tive function is essential for exploring more than88 thousand items of data in E-HowNet.
There-fore, we provide a search function that allowsusers to query lexical senses in two ways:Key-Term Search: The first way is key-termsearch, which is shown in Figure 2.
The syntaxof the query interface is like that used by conven-tional search engines.
By inputting the key-term????
, the system will search all the taxonomynodes, sub-categories, and lexical nodes.
Then,the results for the taxonomy node ?object|??
?and the lexical word ????
will be displayed in47Figure 3: E-HowNet Expression Search Boxthe respective columns.E-HowNet Expression Search: To searcha class of words with specific attribute-values,we provide another query syntax for exploringdata in E-HowNet Expression.
For instance, tofind all expressions about wooden objects in-volves finding E-HowNet data items containingthe entity ?object????
and the attribute-value?material={wood|?}?.
The expressions are en-tered on the form shown in Figure 3 and submittedto the system.
The results of word senses denotingwooden objects are then returned.4 ConclusionE-HowNet sense representations are incremental.Hence, lexical sense expressions can be updatedand refined at anytime.
In addition, logical rela-tions and the taxonomic structure can be rebuiltautomatically based on the refined expressions.New categories in the taxonomy can be identi-fied and characterized by their specific attribute-values.
Uniform representations of functionwords and content words facilitate semantic com-position and decomposition, and allow users toderive sense representations of phrases/sentencesfrom the composition of lexical senses.
Further-more, because of E-HowNet?s semantic decom-position capability, the primitive representationsfor surface sentences with the same deep seman-tics are nearly canonical.
We have implementedthe E-HowNet ontology online to demonstrate thetaxonomy, sub-categories, and lexicons in a hier-archical tree structure.
In addition, we providesearch functions for querying key-terms and E-HowNet expressions.ReferencesKeh-Jiann Chen, Shu-Ling Huang, Yueh-Yin Shih andYi-Jun Chen.
