LINGUISTIC ERROR CORRECTION OF JAPANESE SENTENCESTsutomu Kawada, Shin-ya Amano and Kunio SakaiInformation systems Lab., Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation1 Komukai Toshiba-cho, Saiwai-ku, Kawasaki 210, JAPANAbstractThis paper describes a newly developed lin-guistic error correction system, which can cor-rect errors and rejections of Japanese sentencesby using linguistic knowledge.Conventional optical character readers(OCR) need human assistance to correct theirrecognition errors and rejections.
An operatormust teach the OCR correct answers whenever anillegible character pattern occurs.
If thiserror correction operation is mechanized, thethroughput of the OCR will increase.This linguistic error correction system of-fers means of automated error correction by an-alysing sentences of the OCR outputs linguisti-cally.
This system grammatically selects legalletters from the candidates which can not bedecided uniquely by pattern recognition only,and recommends grammatically and semanticallymeaningful letters for the illegible letter.i.
IntroductionMore than 2,000 different chinese charac-ters are used in Japanese newspapers and pub-lications.
The large repertory of letters aswell as the structual complexity of each char-acter pattern are the main difficulties to rec-ognize letters by OCR.
Mutually similar char-acter patterns mainly cause recognition errorsand rejections.
The difference between suchsimilar letters usually concentrate on a localarea \[ ~ .... ~ , ~ .... ~ , {~ ...., j~  .

The output of OCR contains these ambi-guities.It is necessary to use the contextual in-formation contained in every kind of naturaltext.
The application of context makes it pos-sible to detect errors or even to correct them.The main object of this error correction systemis to resolve these ambiguities on the basis oflinguistic knowledge.
To resolve these ambi-guities each ambiguous letter is put in itssentence, and the sentence is analyzed syntac-tically and semantically.
When the sentencesis acceptable the letter is selected preferably.There has been some contextual post pro-cessing systems.
1~2 But these systems are de-signed to read only postal-addresses.
Thewords which are included in the postal-addressare restricted within a relatively narrow do-main.
The postal address usually consists of aperson's name, place name, postal code and num-bers.
On the other hand this newly developedkanji OCR can read actual texts of Japanesesentences, and its contextual error correctionsystem of it has been designed to deal withmany kinds of words of various parts of speech(noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, etc.
).This error correction system has a practical25,000 words dictionary, and can correct 53.8percent of the errors which are included in theoutputs of kanji OCR.2.
RestrictionsThis system imposes two restrictions oninput data.
One is that the input must consistof grammatical Japanese sentences in order thatsyntax analysis can be applicable.
This systemis not effective for only numeral data texts ora mere list of words.The other restriction is that the texts tobe dealt with must be limited to a specialfield.
By this restriction we can limit thenumber of terminologies which are used in thefield.The corpus used for the experiment is1,700 claims of patent gazettes of the JapanPatent Office.
These gazettes concern themanufacturing technology of LSI devices forthirteen years (1964 - 1976).
Figure 1 showsan example of them.
This corpus includes306,000 words.
There are about 5 thousand dif-ferent words in it.
The distribution of thevarious categories are as follows;noun 3603 functional word 90verb 832 suffix and prefix ii0adjective 75adverb 61conjunction 30As twenty thousand common words are added tothese words, the dictionary contains abouttwenty-five thousand words.3.
Features of Patent SentencesA Japanese written language consists ofkanji, kana (hirakana and katakana) and alpha-numeric letters.
Kana is a phonetic symbol andkanji is an ideograph.
The kana set (eitherhiragana on katakana) consists of 48 letters.More than 2,000 different kanji letters aredaily used.Japanese people write a sentence like one--257--Q)M 0 S ~# ~'~ ~?~\[~\]~-~t~@~ /~ f l~48-  336  4@~ )~ 1ff~4 7 ( 9 7 2 ) 1 2 ) J28~.q~ ~ ~h~4 9 -  0 89  2~.~.~4 9(  19  74)  8~ 30~I,~\]mb ib l iographyl~  ~oclaim sentenceFigure i.

Construction of a Pause Groupcontinuous string of letters with no space (seeFig.
i).
Japanese is different from westernlanguages in this point.
It is firstly impor-tant to identify words in the continuous stringof letters to analyze a Japanese sentence.Figure 2 shows the construction of a pause groupwhich is the minimum meaningful unit of a Japa-nese sentence.
The prefix, the independent wordand the suffix are usually written in kanji orkatakana letters.
The dependent word is writtenin kana letters.
Changes of letter types aswell as punctuation symbols give us useful cluesto the boundaries where it is possible to sepa-rate a long letter string into shorter manage-able units (pause group).
This correction sys-tem detects words by using such conditions forthese boundaries (Fig.
2).Experiments were conducted for the claimsentences of the patents.
A claim sentencehas a particular style.
Most of the claimsentences consist of one sentence.
An ana-lytical study3 of the claim sentences showedthat all sentences were categorized into 14sentence patterns by coordinate phrases.
Theaverage count of words for a sentence is 180words.
The sentence is a big noun phrase andis constructed from many coordinate adjectiveor adverbial phrases which modify the same word.The claim sentence is so long that it is prac-tical to analyze it on the basis of thesephrases.4.
Kanji OCR and it's ErrorsThe large number of character categories aswell as structual complexity of each characterpattern are the dominant difficulties in kanjicharacter recognition.
A two-stage recognitionmethod 4 has been developed to cope with thesedifficulties.
This method employs an efficientcandidate selection prior to a precise individu-al recognition.
Fig.
3 shows a diagram of thetwo-stage recognition method. Selection~ Unit \]First Stage Second Stage"Candidate~l ti  individualecognitiorUnitFigure 3.
Two-Stage Recognition Method DiagramIn the first recognition process stage,feature extraction is carried out on the inputpattern.
Candidate characters are obtained ac-cording to their geometrical features.
In thesecond stage, pattern matchings are carried outbetween the input pattern and each referencepattern in selected candidate characters.
Thedecision is made on the basis of their similar-ity values.The mutually similar patterns as well aslow print quality cause recognition errors andrejections.
These il legible letters have lowsimilarity values.
The recognition speed ofthis kanji OCR is i00 characters per second.More than 99 percent correct recognition ratewas obtained for actual data.
The average let-ter count of the claim sentences is 450 letters.Consequently this system encounters an il legibleletter every second and three or four letters ina claim sentence.As the illegible letters have low similar-- 258ity values, this correction system Can finddoubtful letters easily.
If this error correc-tion system checks all letters which are con-tained in a text, it needs much time to process.This error correction system picks out only thephrases which contain illegible letters, andanalyze the grammatical legality of them.
Bythis restriction this error correction systemdecreases the processing time and becomes apractical one.5.
Error Correction MethodThe error correction system has three an-alysis functions (Fig.
4).a) word analysis functionb) syntax analysis functionc) wording analysis functionTwo notations are used here.
When one let-ter can not be recognized uniquely, the candi-dates for the letter are enclosed in parentheses.A letter which can not be recognized at all isexpressed by a question mark.tSegmentation "= .

Error Correction Method Diagram5.1 Word Analysis FunctionIn case of encountering an ambiguous letterin a sentence, the word analysis program search-es the dictionary to find a grammatically andsemantically valid candidate.For example, ' \[ /< /~ \] ~ -- ~ ~(\[PA BA\]TANNINSIKI)' shows that the first letteris an ambiguous letter.
In this case, two can-didates are tested.
A candidate ' /< ~ --~ (pattern recognition)' is meaningfulbut ' \]~ 9 -- > ~.  '
is not.
So \]~ isdetermined as the unique answer.Some Japanese letters resemble closely.Example i.

1 74 X dashK one(3 symbol for long vowelThe selection from these resembling pat-terns depends on their context.
'- (a longvowel)' is reasonable for ;~ \[ .... \] ~ (BEESU,base).Two or more words are frequently connectedwithout any conjunction or preposition in Japa-nese sentences.
In this case the word analysisprogram calls the compound word analysis sub-program which looks up the word dictionary andmakes a compound word from two or three words toanalyze it.
The above example is a compoundword. '
\]~9 --~/~ (pattern Recogni-tion)' is a compound word constructed from '\ ]~- -~ {pattern) and m~,~ (recognltlon).This subprogram has not only a full-string but asub-string matching ability (Fig.

I(computational linguistics)Figure 5.
Sub-string Matching of a Compound WordWhen a letter has no candidate letter, theword analysis program consults the dictionaryand searches for words which fill up the illegi-ble letter.Example 2.
F~ inovation noun,verb~ proof noun,verb~ manifestation noun,verb~ - f~  civilization noun~ lighting noun,verb~ transparency adjective verbL~ become clear noun,verbIn this case seven letters fill up the ?.The selection from these candidates is perform-ed in the next syntax analysis step.
This wordanalysis program is not valid for consecutiveillegible letters.
As most of the Japanesewords are one or two Kanji letters, consecutiveillegible letters do not give us any clue tosearch the dictionary.
When we are given con-secutive illegible letters '??
', we can hardlyguess what they are.5.2 Syntax Analysis FunctionWhen the word analysis is unsatisfactoryto resolve the ambiguities, the syntax analysisis applied to them.
In example 2, there arestill seven candidates which were selected bythe word analysis function.
The syntax analy-sis program refers the contextual information.Example 3.
9 ~ '~ (transparent terminal)o--259--This program first conducts a morphologicalanalysis of the given pause group, and analyzesthe syntactic role of each pause qroup in itsphrase.
A noun or verb does not conjugate like' ~- (NA), and only an adjective verb can con-jugate like ' ~ (NA)' So ' ~H~ ' is select-ed uniquely.Example 4.
~ \ [~,  hx\] ~ KABAN(GA KA)ARU_~.~ There is a base.In this case ' ~ (KIBAN; base)' in anoun, ' ~ (ARU; be)' is a verb, ' ~ (GA)' isa particle to indicate the subject, and ' ~% (KA)'is a particle to indicate an alternative orquestion.
The particle ' ~ ' only makes thesentence grammatical and ' ~ ~ O  ' isthe unique answer?This syntax analysis program performs themorphological analysis to the segmented pausegroups (Fig.
2).
If the segmentation is incor-rect, this program can not analyze the phraseor sentence.
So this program retries the seg-mentation of the input string to make successfulanalysis results.Example 5. a) ~ l J~\ [~K \ [{  ~'\]  ~1 ,{~' f~ ib) ~\]~..~\]~1?
\[ ~ ' \ ]  ~ '~ /~.
(controZ circuit) (each) (add)This example shows the retry process.
Thesegmentation program firstly segments a stringat the point of letter type changing (b).
Thissegmentation is not correct.
The first pausegroup is not grammatical.
This program assumesthat this pause group may be a compound pausegroup, and searches all possible separationsfrom left to right.
This program finds a em-bedded adverb ' ~ %%~L (SOREZORE; each)',and by this segmentation this sentence can beanalyzed successfully.
The other candidate ' ~ 'can make no grammatical sentence.5.3 Wording Analysis FunctionIn the sentences of patent gazettes, impor-tant words or key words are repeatedly used withanapholic pronouns.
This fact is a very impor-tant clue to find an anaphola or to guess theambiguous letter.
The arrows in Fig.
6 show theanapholic relations of words in a text.
Somekinds of particular anapholic pronouns appear .
.in patent texts (' .. J .~ (above-mentloned),' ~ (GAI; such)', ' ~ (DOU; same)' and' ~ (KONO; this\]).
When an illegible let-ter occurs in an anapholic words, the wordinganalysis program searches the indicated wordand correct the illegible letter by the matchedletter.
In Fig 6, ' ~.~: l~,9~?

Anapholic Relations in a Sentence(above-mentioned connected area)' has an ana-pholic pronoun ' ~,~i '. '
~ ' ~  ' iscompared with the indicated word ' ~ ', and _?
is corrected to ' ~j~ '.
The word-ing analysis program automatically prints outa glossary of texts.
This glossary is used toaugment the dictionary of the error correctionsystem?Numeric expressions are also used frequent-ly.
Numeric expressions are analyzed by usingsemantic relations of words in their vicinity.As the bibliography of a patent contains thename of a person, place and affi l lated organi-zation, the correction system needs to changethe dictionary from a common dictionary to aproper noun dictionary.
In a proper noun pausegroup, it is more important to analyze thesemantic relation among the words.

/~  ~J (name of city) ~r~ I% (person's name)This phrase describes an address, and ' ~\](city)' is a suffix for the name of a placewhich does not connect with a person's name.
Sothe il legible letter can be decided uniquely.6.
System Configuration and Experimental ResultsFig.

The error correctionsystem is programmed on a mini-computer (TOSBAC-40).
The text editing terminal is a newly de-veloped Japanese word processor.
The operatorof this system can confirm the error correctionresults on the CRT display, change the form ofthe text by versatile editing functions, storeand transfer them to the host machine.The experimental results for actual 250-260  -Figure 7.

ConclusionThis error correction system can correctabout fifty percent of the errors and rejec-tions of kanji OCR outputs and was effective toincrease the total throughput of the kanji OCR.The kanji OCR reads letters according totheir geometrical feature, and this linguisticerror correction system reads a sentenceaccording to the linguistic knowledge.
The com-bination of the kanji OCR and linguistic errorcorrection system realizes a practical Japanesetext reader and can cope with the increasingdemands for input of Japanese document informa-tion.
The throughput rate of the OCR, combinedwith this linguistic error correction system, isabout i0 times higher than that of a conventionalmanual data entry.8.
