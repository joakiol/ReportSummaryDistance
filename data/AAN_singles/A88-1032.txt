Localizing Expression of AmbiguityJohn Bear and Jerry R. HobbsArtificial Intelligence CenterSRI InternationalAbstractIn this paper we describe an implemented program forlocalizing the expression of many types of syntactic am-biguity, in the logical forms of sentences, in a mannerconvenient for subsequent inferential processing.
Amongthe types of ambiguities handled are prepositional phrases,very compound nominals, adverbials, relative clatmes, andpreposed prepositional phrases.
The algorithm we use ispresented, and several possible shortcomings and exten-sions of our method are discussed.1 In t roduct ionAmbiguity is a problem in any natural anguage processingsystem.
Large grammars tend to produce large numbersof alternative analyses for even relatively simple sentences.Furthermore, as is well known, syntactic information maybe insu~cient for selecting a best reading.
It may take se-mantic knowledge of arbitrary complexity to decide whichalternative to choose.In the TACITUS project \[Hobbs, 1986; Hobbs andMartin, 1987\] we are developing a pragmatics componentwhich, given the logical form of a sentence, uses worldknowledge to solve various interpretation problems, ther~=oluti,JD of syntactic ambiguity among them.
Sentencesare translated into logical form by the DIALOGIC systemfor syntactic mid semantic analysis \[Grosz et al, 1982\].In this paper we describe how information about alter-native parses is passed concisely from DIALOGIC to thepragmatics component, and more generally, we discuss amethod of localizing the representation f syntactic ambi-guity in the logical form of a sentence.One possible approach to the ambiguity problem wouldbe to produce a set of logical forms for a sentence, one foreach parse tree, and to send them one at a time to thepragrnatics component.
This involves considerable dupli-cation of effort if the logical forms are largely the sameand differ only with respect o attachment.
A more effi-cient approach is to try to localize the information aboutthe alternate possibilities.Instead of feeding two logical forms, which differ onlywith respect o an attachment site, to a pragraatics com-ponent, it is worthwhile trying to condense the informationof the two logical forms together into one expression with adisjunction inside it representing the attachment ambigu-ity.
That one expression may then be given to a pragmat-ics component with the effect that parts of the sentencethat would have been processed twice are now processedonly once.
The savings can be considerably more dramaticwhen a set of five or ten or twenty logical forms can be re-duced to one, as is often the case.In effect, this approach translates the syntactic ambigu-ity problem into a highly constrained coreference problem.It is as though we translated the sentence in (1) into thetwo sentences in (2)(1) John drove down the street in a car.
(2) John drove down the street.
It was in a car.where we knew "it" had to refer either to the street orto the driving.
Since coreference is one of the phenomenathe pragmatics component is designed to cope with \[Hobbsand Martin, 1987\], such a translation represents progresstoward a solution.The rest of this paper describes the procedures we useto produce a reduced set of logical forms from a largerset.
The basic strategy hinges on the idea of a neu-tral representation \[Hobbs, 1982\].
This is similar to theidea behind Church's Pseudo-attachment \[Church, 19801 .Pereira's Rightmost Normal Form \[Pereira, 1983\], andwhat Rich et al refer to as the Procr~tination Approachto parsing \[Rich, Barnett, Wittenburg, and Whittemore.1986\].
However, by expressing the ambiguity as a disjunc-tion in logical form, we put it into the form most convenientfor subsequent inferential processing.2 Range o f  Phenomena2.1 At tachment  PossibilitiesThere are three representative classes of attachment ambi-guities, and we have implemented our approach :o each ofthese.
For each class, we give representative examples andshow the relevant logical form fragments that encode theset of possible attachments.In the first class are those constituents that may attachto either nouns or verbs.
(3) John saw the man with the telescope.235The prepositional phrase (PP) "with the telescope" can beattached either to "the man" or to "saw".
If m stands forthe man, t for the telescope, and e for the seeing event, theneutral ogical form for the sentence includes.
.
.
A wi th(s t ,  t) A \[st = m V y = e\] A .
.
.That is, something St is with the telescope, and it is eitherthe man or the seeing event.Gerund modifiers may also modify nouns and verbs, re-suiting in ambiguities like that in the sentenceI saw the Grand Canyon, flying to New York.Their treatment is identical to that of PPs.
If g is theGrand Canyon, n is New York, and e is the seeing event,the neutral ogical form will include.
.
.
A f ist (st ,  n )  ^ \[st = g V St = e\] A .
.
.That is, something St is flying to New York, and it is eitherthe Grand Canyon or the seeing event.In the second class are those constituents that can onlyattach to verbs, such as adverbials.George said Sara left his wife yesterday.Here "yesterday" can modify the saying or the leaving butnot "his wife".
Suppose we take yesterday  to be a predi-cate that applies to events and specifies omething abouttheir times of occurrence, and suppose el is the leavingevent and e2 the saying event.
Then the neutral ogicalform will include.
.
.
^ Ue~terdast (s t )  ^ \[st = e l  v U = e2\] ^  .
.
.That is, something y was yesterday and it is either theleaving event or the saying event.Related to this is the case of a relative clause wherethe preposed constituent is a PP, which could have beenextracted from any of several embedded clauses.
InThat was the week during which George thoughtSam told his wife he was leaving,the thinking, the telling, or the leaving could have beenduring the week.
Let w be the week, el the thinking, e2the telling, and es the leaving.
Then the neutral ogicalform will include.
.
.
A dur ing(st ,  w)  A \[y = et V y = e2V st = es\] A .
.
.That is, something y was during the week, and y is eitherthe thinking, the telling, or the leaving.The third class contains those constituents that mayonly attach to nouns, e.g., relative clauses.This component recycles the oil that flowsthrough the compressor that is still good.The second relative clause.
"that is still good," can attachto "'compressor", or "oil", but not to "flows" or ~'recycles;'.Let o be the oil and c the compressor.
Then, ignoring"still", the neutral ogical form will include.
.
.
^ 9ood(s t )  A \[st = e V St = o\] A .
.
.That is, something y is still good, and y is either the com-pressor or the oil.Similar to this are the compound nominal ambiguities,as inHe inspected the oil filter element.
"Oil" could modify either "filter" or "element".
Let o bethe oil, f the filter, e the element, and nn the implicitrelation that is encoded by the nominal compound con-struction.
Then the neutral ogical form will include.
.
.
A ,~n(/ ,  e) ^ nn(o ,  St) A \[st = / V St = e\] ^ .
.
.That is, there is some implicit relation nn between the filterand the element, and there is another implicit relation nnbetween the oil and something y, where y is either the filteror the element.Our treatment of all of these types of ambiguity has beenimplemented.In fact, the distinction we base the attachment possi-bilities on is not that between ouns and verbs, but thatbetween event variables and entity variables in the logicalform.
This means that we would generate logical formsencoding the attachment of adverbials to event nominai-izations in those cases where the event nouns are translatedwith event variables.
Thus inI read about Judith's promotion last year.
"last year" would be taken as modifying either the promo-tion or the reading, if "promotion" were represented by anevent variable in the logical form.2.2 Single or Multiple Parse TreesIn addition to classifying attachment phenomena in termsof which kind of constituent something may attach to,there is another dimension along which we need to clas-sify the phenomena: does the D IALOGIC  parser produceall possible parses, or only one?
For some regular struc-tural ambiguities, such as very compound nominals, andthe "during which" examples, only a single parse is pro-duced.
In this case it is straightforward to produce fromthe parse a neutral representation encoding all the possi-bilities.
In the other cases, however, such as (nonpreposed)PPs, adverbials, and relative clauses, D IALOGIC  producesan exhaustive (and sometimes exhausting) list of the dif-ferent possible structures.
This distinction is an artifactof our working in the D IALOGIC  system.
It would bepreferable if there were only one tree constructed which236was somehow neutral with respect o attachment.
How-ever, the DIALOGIC grammar is large and complex, andit would have been difficult o implement such_ an approach.Thus, in these cases, one of the parses, the one correspond-ing to right association \[Kimball, 1973\], is selected, and theneutral representation is generated from that.
This makesit necessary to suppress redundant readings, as describedbelow.
(In fact, limited heuristics for suppressing multi-ple parse trees have recently been implemented in DIA-LOGIC.
)2.3 Thematic Role AmbiguitiesNeutral representations are constructed for one other kindof ambiguity in the TACITUS system--ambiguities in thethematic role or case of the arguments.
In the sentenceIt broke the window.we don't know whether "it" is the agent or the instru-ment.
Suppose the predicate break takes three arguments,an agent, a patient, and an instrument, and suppose x iswhatever is referred to by "it" and w is the window.
Thenthe neutral logical form will include.
.
.
A break(yl,w, y2) A \[y, = z V Y2 = x\] A ...That is, something Yl breaks the window with somethingelse Y2, and either yl or y2 is whatever is referred to by"it" .12.4 Ambiguities Not HandledThere are other types of structural ambiguity about whichwe have little to say.
InThey will win one day in Hawaii,one of the obvious readings is that "one day in Hawaii"is an adverbial phrase.
However, another perfectly rea-sonable reading is that "one day in Hawaii" is the directobject of the verb "win".
This is due to the verb havingmore than one subcategorization frame that could be filledby the surrounding constituents.
It is the existence of thiskind of ambiguity that led to the approach of not havingDIALOGIC try to build a single neutral representationin all cases.
A neutral representation for such sentences,though possible, would be very complicated.Similarly, we do not attempt o produce neutral repre-sentations for fortuitous or unsystematic ambiguities suchas those exhibited in sentences likeThey are flying planes.Time flies like an arrow.Becky saw her duck.1The treatment of thematic role ambiguities has been implementedby Paul Martin as part of the interface between DIALOGIC and thepragmatic processes ofTACITUS that translates the logical forms ofthe sentences into a canonical representation.2.5 Resolving AmbiguitiesIt is beyond the scope of this paper to describe the prag-matics processing that is intended to resolve the ambigu-ities (see Hobbs and Martin, 1987).
Nevertheless, we dis-cuss one nontrivial example, just to give the reader a feelfor the kind of processing it is.
Consider the sentenceWe retained the filter element for future analysis.Let r be the retaining event, f the filter element, and athe analysis.
Then the logical form for the sentence willinclude.
.
.
A for (y ,a)  A \ [y= f V y=r \ ]  A .
.
.The predicate for ,  let us say, requires the relationenable(y, a) to obtain between its arguments.
That is, if yis for a, then either y or something coercible from y mustsomehow enable a or something coercible from a. TheTACITUS knowledge base contains axioms encoding thefact that having something is a prerequisite for analyzingit and the fact that a retaining is a having, y can thus beequal to r, which is consistent with the constraints on y.On the other hand, any inference that the filter elementenables the analysis will be much less direct, and conse-quently will not be chosen.3 The  A lgor i thm3.1 Finding Attachment SitesThe logical forms (LFs) that are produced from each ofthe parse trees are given to an attachment-finding programwhich adds, or makes explicit, information about possibleattachment sites.
Where this makes some LFs redundant,as in the prepositional phrase case, the redundant LFs arethen eliminated.For instance, for the sentence in (4),(4) John saw the man in the park with the telescope.DIALOGIC produces five parse trees, and five correspond-ing logical forms.
When the attachment-finding routine isrun on an LF, it annotates the LF with information abouta set of variables that might be the subject (i.e., the at-tachment site) of each PP.The example below shows the LFs for one of the fivereadings before and after the attachment-finding routine isrun on it.
They are somewhat simplified for the purposesof exposition.
In this notation, a proposition is a predi-cate followed by one or more arguments.
An argument isa variable or a complex term.
A complex term is a vari-able followed by a "such that" symbol "\[ ", followed by aconjunction of one or more propositions?
Complex terms2This notation can be translated into a Russellian notation, withthe consequent loss of information about grammatical subordination,by repeated application ofthe transformation p(z I Q) =~ p(z) A Q.237are enclosed in square brackets for readability.
Events arerepresented by event variables, as in \[Hobbs, 1985\], so thatsee'(el,zl,x~) means el is a seeing event by ,vl of x2.One of sentence (4)'s LFs before attachment-finding is\[xl I John(xl)l,in(x~,\[x31 pa~k(x3) ^with(xs,The same LF after attachment-finding ispa~t(\[e, I ~ee'(~l,\[x~ I John(x~)\],\[~ Iman(~) ^\[~ Ip-~k(~) ^with(\[y2 1 92=x3 V y2=x2 V~2:el\],\[~, I t~t~cop~(x,)\])\])\])\])A paraphrase of the latter LF in English would be some-thing like this: There is an event el that happened in thepast; it is a seeing event by xl who is John, of x2 who isthe man; something yl is in the park, and that somethingis either the man or the seeing event; something Y2 is witha telescope, and that something is the park, the man, orthe seeing event.The procedure for finding possible attachment sites inorder to modify a logical form is as follows.
The programrecursively descends an LF, and keeps lists of the eventand entity variables that initiate complex terms.
Eventvariables associated with tenses are omitted.
When theprogram arrives at some part of the LF that can have mul-tiple attachment sites, it replaces the explicit argument byan existentially quantified variable y, determines whetherit can be an event variable, an entity variable, or either,and then encodes the list of possibilities for what y couldequal.3.2 Eliminating Redundant LogicalFormsIn those cases where more than one parse tree, and hencemore than one logical form, is produced by DIALOGIC,it is necessary to eliminate redundant readings.
In orderto do this, once the attachment possibilities are registered,the LFs are flattened (thus losing temporarily the gram-matical subordination i formation), and some simplifyingpreprocessing is done.
Each of the flattened LFs is com-pared with the others.
Any LF that is subsumed by an-other is discarded as redundant.
One LF subsumes anotherif the two LFs are the same except hat the first has a listof possible attachment sites that includes the correspond-ing list in the second.
For example, one LF for sentence(3) says that "with the telescope" can modify either "'saw"or "the man", and one says that it modifies "saw".
Thefirst LF subsumes the second, and the second is discardedand not compared with any other LFs.
Thus, although theLFs are compared pairwise, if all of the ambiguity is dueto only one attachment indeterminacy, each LF is lookedat only once.Frequently, only some of the alternatives may be thrownout.
ForAndy said he lost yesterdayaffer attachment-finding, one logical form allows "yester-day" to be attached to either the saying or the losing, whileanother attaches it only to the saying.
The second is sub-sumed by the first, and thus discarded.
However, there isa third reading in which "yesterday" is the direct object of"lost" and this neither subsumes nor is subsumed by theothers and is retained.4 Lost  In fo rmat ion4.1 Crossing DependenciesOur attachment-finding routine constructs a logical formthat describes all of the standard readings of a sentence,but it also describes ome nonstandard readings, namelythose corresponding to parse trees with crossing branches,or crossing dependencies.
An example would be a readingof (4) in which the seeing was in the park and the man waswith the telescope.For small numbers of possible attachment sites, this isan acceptable result.
If a sentence is two-ways ambiguous(due just to attachment), we get no wrong readings.
If it isfive-ways ambiguous on the standard analysis, we get sixreadings.
However, in a sentence with a sequence of fourPPs, the standard analysis (and the DIALOGIC parser)get 42 readings, whereas our single disjuncqve LF standsfor 120 different readings.Two things can be said about what to do in these caseswhere the two approaches diverge widely.
We could arguethat sentences with such crossing dependencies do exist inEnglish.
There are some plausible sounding examples.Specify the length, in bytes, of the word.Kate saw a man on Sunday with a wooden leg.In the first, the phrase "in bytes" modifies "specify", and"of the word" modifies "the length".
In the second, "onSunday" modifies "saw" and "with a wooden leg" modifies"a man".
Stucky \[1987\] argues that such examples areacceptable and quite frequent.On the other hand, if one feels that these putative ex-amples of crossing dependencies can be explained away238and should be ruled out.
there is a way to do it withinour framework.
One can encode in the LFs a crossing-dependencies constraint, and consult hat constraint whendoing the pragmatic processing.To handle the crossing-dependencies onstraint (whichwe have not yet implemented), the program would needto keep the list of the logical variables it constructs.
Thislist would contain three kinds of variables, event variables,entity variables, and the special variables (the y's in theLFs above) representing attachment ambiguities.
The listwould keep track of the order in which variables were en-countered in descending the LF.
A separate list of just thespecial y variables also needs to be kept.
The strategywould be that in trying to resolve referents, whenever onetries to instantiate a y variable to something, the other yvariables need to be checked, in accordance with the fol-lowing constraint:There cannot be Yl, Y2 in the list of y's such thatB(yx) < B(y2) < Yl < Y2, where B(y~) is theproposed variable to which yi will be boundor with which it will be coreferential, and the< operator means "precedes in the list of vari-ables".This constraint handles a single phrase that has attach-ment ambiguities.
It also works in the case where there isa string of PPs in the subji~ct NP, and then a string of PPsin the object NP, as inThe man with the telescope in the park loungedon the bank of a river in the sun.With the appropriate crossing-dependency constraints, thelogical form for this would be 3past(\[el \[lounge'(el,\[xl I man(z,) Aw/th(\[u, l ul = ~, v u, = ed,Ix2 \[telescope(x2) Ain(\[y2 I Y2=x2 V y2=xl VY2~el\],\[~31 pa,-k(x3)\])\])\]) Aon(el,\[x4 I bank(x4) Aof(\[us l u3 = ~ v u~ = ed,\ [~ I ' i~(~)  Ain(\[y4 \[ y4=zs Y y4=z4 V y4=e,\],\[~s I ~'n(~)l)\]) l)  Acrossing-info( <el, xx, Yl, x2, Y2, xa>,{Yl, Y2}) Acrossing-in f o( < el , x 4, Ys, Xs, Y4, xs> ,{U3, Y,})\])3We are assuming "with the telescope" and "in the park" can mod-ify the lounging, which they certainly can if we place commas beforeand after them.4 .2  Noncore ference  Const ra in tsOne kind of information that is provided by the DIA-LOGIC system is information about coreference and non-coreference insofar as it can be determined from syntacticstructure.
Thus, the logical form forJohn saw him.includes the information that "John" and "him" cannotbe coreferential.
This interacts with our localization ofattachment ambiguity.
Consider the sentence,John returned Bill's gift to him.If we attach "to him" to "gift", "him" can be coreferentialwith "John" but it cannot be coreferential with "Bill".
Ifwe attach it to "returned", him" can be coreferential with"Bill" but not with "John".
It is therefore not enough tosay that the "subject" of "to" is either the gift or the re-turning.
Each alternative carries its own noncoreferenceconstraints with it.
We do not have an elegant solution tothis problem.
We mention it because, to our knowledge,this interaction of noncoreference onstraints and PP at-tachment has not been noticed by other researchers takingsimilar approaches.5 A Note  on  L i te ra l  Mean ingThere is an objection one could make to our whole ap-proach.
If our logical forms are taken to be a represen-tation of the "literal meaning" of the sentence, then wewould seem to be making the claim that the literal mean-ing of sentence (2) is "Using a telescope, John saw a man,or John saw a man who had a telescope," whereas the realsituation is that either the literal meaning is "Using a tele-scope, John saw a man," or the literal meaning is "Johnsaw a man who had a telescope."
The disjunction occursin the metalanguage, whereas we may seem to be claimingit is in the language.The misunderstanding behind this objection is that thelogical form is not intended to represent "literal meaning".There is no general agreement on precisely what consti-tutes "literal meaning", or even whether it is a coherentnotion.
In any case, few would argue that the meaning ofa sentence could be determined on the basis of syntacticinformation alone.
The logical forms produced by the DI-ALOGIC system are simply intended to encode all of theinformation that syntactic processing can extract aboutthe sentence.
Sometimes the best we can come up within this phase of the processing is disjunctive informationabout attachment sites, and that is what the LF records.
'~'lO 2396 Future  Extens ions6 .1  Extend ing  the  Range o f  PhenomenaThe work that has been done demonstrates the feasibilityof localizing in logical form information about attachmentambiguities.
There is some mundane programming to doto handle the cases similar to those described here, e.g.,other forms of postnominai modification.
There is also thecrossing-dependency constraint to implement.The principal area in which we intend to extend ourapproach is various kinds of conjunction ambiguities.
Ourapproach to some of these cases is quite similar to whatwe have presented already.
In the sentence,(5) Mary told us John was offended and George leftthe party early.it is possible for George's leaving to be conjoined with ei-ther John's being offended or Mary's telling.
FollowingHobbs \[1985\], conjunction is represented in logical form bythe predicate and' taking a self argument and two eventvariables as its arguments.
In (5) suppose l stands for thetelling, e2 for the being offended, es for the leaving, and e0for the conjunction.
Then the neutral representation for(5) would includeand'(eo, yo, e3) A tell'(el, M, y~)^ ((y0 = e~ ^  ul = e2) v (y0 = e2 ^  y~.
= e0))That is, there is a conjunction e0 of Y0 and the leaving ca;there is a telling el by Mary of Yl; and either y0 is thetelling el and yl is the being offended e2, or y0 is the beingoffended e2 and yl is the conjunction e0.A different kind of ambiguity occurs in noun phrase con-junction.
In(6) Where are the British and American ships?there is a set of British ships and a disjoint set of Americanships, whereas in(7) Where are the tall and handsome men?the natural interpretation is that a single set of men isdesired, consisting of men who are both tall and handsome.In TACITUS, noun phrase conjunction is encoded withthe predicate andn, taking three sets as its arguments.The expression andn(sl,s2,sa) means that the set sl isthe union of sets s~ and sa.
4 Following Hobbs \[1983\], therepresentation f plurals involves a set and a typical ele-ment of the set, or a reified universally quantified variableranging over the elements of the set.
Properties like cardi-nality are properties of the set itself, while properties thathold for each of the elements are properties of the typicalelement.
An axiom schema specifies that any properties of4If either st or s2 is not a set, the singleton set consisting of justthat element isused instead.the typical element are inherited by the individual, actualdements)  Thus, the phrase "British and American ships"is translated into the set sl such thatandn(ShS~,Sa) A typelt(zl ,s l)  A ship(x1)A typelt(x2,s2) A British(x2)A typelt(xa, sa) A American(xa)That is, the typical element xl of the set sl is a ship, andsl is the union of the sets s2 and s3, where the typicalelement x2 of s2 is British, and the typical element xa ofsa is American.The phrase "tall and handsome men" can be representedin the same way.andn(sl,s2,sa) A typelt(zl ,s l)  A man(x1)A typelt(x2, s2) A tall(x2)A typelt(za, sa) A handsome(xa)Then it is a matter for pragmatic processing to discoverthat the set s2 of tall men and the set sa of handsome menare in fact identical.In this representational framework, the treatment givento the kind of ambiguity il lustrated inI like intelligent men and women.resembles the treatment given to attachment ambiguities.The neutral ogical form would include.
.
.
A andn(sl,s2,sa) A typelt(xl,sl)A typelt(x2, s2) A man(x2)A typelt(xa, s3) A woman(za)A intelligent(y) A \[y = xl Y y = x2\]That is, there is a set sl, with typical element zl,  which isthe union of sets s2 and sa, where the typical element x2of s2 is a man and the typical element xa of sa is a woman,and something y is intelligent, where y is either the typicalelement xl of s~ (the typical person) or the typical elementx= of s2 (the typical man).Ambiguities in conjoined compound nominals can berepresented similarly.
The representation foroil pump and filterwould include.
.
.
A andn(s,p, f )  A typelt(z,s) A pump(p)^f i l te r ( f )  n oil(o) A nn(o,y)^\[y=p v y=xlThat is, there is a set s, with typical element x, composedof the elements p and f,  where p is a pump and f is a filter,and there is some implicit relation nn between some oil oand y, where y is either the pump p or the typical elementx or s.

)6.2 Ordering HeuristicsSo far we have only been concerned with specifying theset of possible attachment sites.
However, it is true, em-pirically, that certain attachment sites can be favored overothers, strictly on the basis of syntactic (and simple se-mantic) information alone.
~For example, for the prepositional phrase attachmentproblem, an informal study of several hundred examplessuggests that a very good heuristic is obtained by usingthe following three principles: (1) favor right association;(2) override right association if (a) the PP is temporal andthe second nearest attachment site is a verb or event nom-inalization, or (b) if the preposition typically signals anargument of the second nearest attachment site (verb orrelational noun) and not of the nearest attachment site;(3) override right association if a comma (or comma into-nation) separates the PP from the nearest attachment site.The preposition"of" should be treated specially; for "of"PPs, right association is correct over 98% of the time.There are two roles such a heuristic ordering of possibil-ities can play.
In a system without sophisticated seman-tic or pragmatic processing, the favored attachment couldsimply be selected.
On the other hand, in a system suchas TACITUS in which complex inference procedures accessworld knowledge in interpreting a text, the heuristic order-ing can influence an allocation of computational resourcesto the various possibilities.AcknowledgementsThe authors have profited from discussions with StuShieber about this work.
