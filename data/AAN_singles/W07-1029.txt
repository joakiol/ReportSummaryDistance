whereas author Y claimsthat ?protein A does not interact with B?.
Ofcourse, merely discovering a potential contradic-tion does not mean the argument is closed as otherfactors may have caused the proteins to behave indifferent ways.
We present preliminary work to-wards the automatic detection of potential contra-dictions between PPIs from text and an agreementexperimental evaluation of our method.2 MethodOur method consists of the following steps: i) ex-tract positive and negative cases of PPIs and mapthem to a semantic structure; ii) compare the pairsof PPIs structures that contain similar canonicalprotein names iii) apply an inference method to theselected pair of PPIs.We extract positive and negative cases of PPIsby applying our system (Sanchez & Poesio, sub-mitted).
Our system considers proteins only as wellas events where only one protein participates (e.g.
?PI-3K activity?).
The system produces the seman-tic interpretation shown in Table 1.
We manuallycorrected some of the information extracted in or-der to compare exclusively our inference methodwith human annotators.The decision to determine if a C-PPI holds isgiven by the context.
This context is formed by thecombination of semantic components such as PPIpolarity, verb direction, and manner polarity.P1 Canonical name of the first participant proteinP2 Canonical name of the second participant protein.Cue-word Word (verbs or their nominalizations) expressing a PPI(e.g.
interact, interaction, activate, activation, etc.

Example of manner polarityManner polarity is neutral (2) if the manner wordis not included in the manner polarity table or if nomanner word affects the cue-word.The method first obtains what we call ?PPIstate?
of each PPI.
The PPI state is obtained in twosteps that follow decision tables1: a) the values for1Some decision tables are omitted due to space reasons.195the combination of the verb direction and the man-ner polarity (DM) of each PPI; b) then, the DMvalue and the polarity of the corresponding PPI areevaluated.Second, the method compares the PPI states ofboth PPIs as shown in Table 5.State1 Sstate2 Result State1 State2 Result0 0 NC 3 3 U0 1 C 0 4 C0 3 U 1 4 C1 1 NC 3 4 C1 3 UTable 5.
Decision table for results2The following example illustrates our method.
Thetable below shows two sentences taken from dif-ferent documents.Document 1 Document 2Cells treated with hyperosmolar stress,UV-C, IR, or a cell-permeable form ofceramide, C2 ceramide, rapidly down-regulated PI(3)K activity to 10%-30% ofthe activity found in serum-stimulatedcontrol cells?And fourth, C2-ceramide did notaffect the amount ofPI 3-kinase activity inanti-IRS-1 precipi-tates.The semantic structures corresponding to thesesentences are shown in the next table.DocA DocBP1 C2-ceramide C2-ceramideP2 PI-3K PI-3KCue down-regulate affectSemantic relation Inactivate CausePolarity positive negativeDirection negative neutralManner rapidly --Manner polarity positive neutralThe decision tables produced for this example arethe following3.PPI Direction Manner DMA -  (0) + (1) - (0)B N (2) N (2) U (3)PPI Polarity DM StateA + (1) - (0) - (0)B - (0) U(3) NN (4)2Result values: contradiction (C), no contradiction (NC) andunsure (U).3The values included in the tables are: positive=1, nega-tive=0, neutral=2, unsure=3, and negative-neutral=4.PPIA state PPIB state Result-(0) NN (4) ContradictionThe result obtained is ?Contradiction?.3 Agreement experimentAs a way of evaluation, we compared agreementbetween our method and human annotators by us-ing the kappa measure (Siegel and Castellan,1998).
We elaborated a test containing only of 31pairs of sentences (JBC articles) since this task canbe tiring for human annotators.The test consisted on classifying the pairs ofsentences into three categories: contradiction (C),no contradiction (NC) and unsure (U).
The valuesof kappa obtained are presented in the followingtable.Groups KappaBiologists only 0.37Biologists and our method 0.37Non-biologists only 0.22Non-biologists and our method 0.19Table 6 Agreement valuesBiologists mainly justified their answers based onbiological knowledge (e.g.
methodology, organ-isms, etc.)
while non-biologists based their answerson syntax.4 ConclusionsWe have presented a simple method to detect po-tential contradictions of PPIs by using context ex-pressed by semantics and linguistics constituents(e.g.
modals, verbs, adverbs, etc).
Our methodshowed to perform similarly to biologists and bet-ter than non-biologists.
Interestingly, biologistsconcluded that C-PPIs are rarely found; neverthe-less, the cases found may be highly significant.Continuing with our work, we will try our sys-tem in a larger set of data.ReferencesSanchez,O and Poesio,M.
