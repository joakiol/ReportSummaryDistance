A Prototype Reading Coach that Listens:Summary of Project LISTENAlex Hauptmann, Jack Mostow, Steven F. Roth, Matthew Kane, and Adam SwiftProject LISTEN 1, 215 Cyert Hall, 4910 Forbes AvenueCarnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890What: Project LISTEN is developing a novel weapon againstilliteracy: an automated reading coach that displays a story on acomputer screen, listens to a child read it aloud, and helps where 1.needed.
The coach provides acombination of reading and listen-ing, in which the child reads wherever possible, and the coachhelps wherever necessary.
We demonstrated a prototype of thiscoach at the ARPA Workshop on Human Language Technologyin March 1994.
A short video shows the coach in action \[1\].
2.Who: The intended users of the coach include children in grades1-3, where oral reading is emphasized.
Its developers include 3.experts on speech technology, reading, and human-computer in-teraction.
Its testers include approximately 100 second graders inPittsburgh public schools who have difficulty in reading.
4.Why: Illiteracy costs the United States over $225 billion dollarsannually in corporate retraining, lost competitiveness, and in-dustrial accidents \[2\].
Individuals with low reading proficiencyare much likelier to be unemployed, poor, or incarcerated \[3\].
5.Automated literacy tutoring is an important, real, and challengingtask requiring multimodal interaction and real-time response.How: Project LISTEN is made possible by years of government-funded research that produced CMU's Sphinx-I/ speechrecognizer \[4\], which we adapted to detect errors in oral reading 6.of known text \[5, 6, 7\].
We modelled the coach after expertreading teachers and refined it based on experimental use \[8\].Evaluation: Pilot experiments reported in \[7\] tested both thecoach's accuracy in detecting reading errors, and its potentialeffectiveness in helping children read.
7.Future work: Our primary goal is to extend and deploy thecoach in order to help children read better over time.
Possiblespinoff applications include adult literacy, English as a secondlanguage, foreign language learning, interactive ntertainment, 8.and computer-assisted writing.
We envision a new generation ofintelligent tutoring systems that listen to their students, providingindividualized attention that conventional classrooms cannot.REFERENCESJ.
