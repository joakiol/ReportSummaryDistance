WORDNET: A LEXICAL DATABASE FOR ENGLISHGeorge A. Miller, Principal InvestigatorCogni t ive  Sc ience LaboratoryPr inceton Univers i tyPr inceton,  NJ 08542PROJECT GOALSWork under this grant is intended to provide lexicalresources for research on natural anguages.
The principalproduct is WordNet, a lexical database for English whoseorganization is inspired by current psycholinguistic theoriesof human lexical knowledge.
Lexicalized concepts areorganized by semantic relations for nouns, verbs, adjectives,and adverbs.The principal goal of the project is to upgrade WordNet andmake it available to interested users.
A secondary goal is toexplore practical applications of WordNet; its possible usein the resolution of word senses in context (semantic disam-biguation) is viewed as a necessary precursor for many otherapplications.RECENT RESULTSWordNet Upgrade, The basic elements of WordNet aresets of synonyms (synsets), which are taken to represent lex-icalized concepts.
The database is organized by bi-directional pointers between synsets which correpond tofamiliar semantic relations: (synonymy, antonymy, hypo-nymy, meronymy, troponymy, entailment, etc.).
During thepast year the number of entries (words and collocations) inWordNet has grown from 62,700 to 82,600; the number oflexicalized concepts (synsets) from 50,300 to 62,700; thenumber of unique word-sense combinations from 98,300 to117,300; and the number of synsets that include definitionalglosses from 20,700 to 39,400.
The syntactic ategory ofadverb has been added; there are now 1,200 adverb synsets.Software Development and Distribution.
WordNet isavailable to the research community via anonymous ftp oron diskettes for PC users.
A fourth version of the database,WordNet 1.3, was released 9 December 1992; notices weresent to 175 individuals and laboratories who had previouslyexpressed interest.
An X-windows interface that includes aprogram to recognize inflectional morphology is availablefor Sun SPARCstations; interfaces are also available forDECstations, NEXT, Microsoft Windows, and Macintosh.Address inquiries to wordnet@princeton.edu.Sense Resolution.
A corpus of sentences using the noun"l ine" in different senses has been compiled and used tocompare different methods of automatically determiningfrom context which sense was intended.
Preliminary effortshave been made to explore the use of WordNet o generalizethe contexts that emerge from such studies.Semantie Tagging.
In support of the studies of sense reso-lution, a portion of the Brown Corpus has been tagged withpointers to WordNet.
The result is a semantic oncordance:a textual corpus and a lexicon so combined that every sub-stantive word in the text is linked to its appropriate sense inthe lexicon.
To facilitate the task, an X-windows interface,ConText, has been developed that displays the text alongwith the WordNet entry for each content word; the userselects the appropriate sense, or inserts a comment that isused by the lexicographers to upgrade WordNet.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARWordNet will continue to be expanded and improved, andmade available to interested users.
There is interest inincluding more syntactic information, although that stepwould probably require formulating WordNet as a relationaldatabase.
We have been considering that move for sometime, but have lacked the necessary personnel.
We are alsoconsidering how to incorporate more syntactic informationin the output of ConText, and have secured permission fromIBM to use McCord's English Slot Grammar on an experi-mental basis.We plan to collect more systematic data on the adequacy ofWordNet.
The use of WordNet for semantic tagging pro-vides a valuable test of its coverage and precision; the per-centage of words in a text that are either missing or are usedto express enses not included in WordNet fluctuates radi-cally depending on the topic of a passage, but the averageshould decline steadily as the work proceeds.
By summer1993 we expect o be able to release an initial corpus ofsemantically tagged passages to authorized users of theBrown Corpus.We are also developing a method to analyze the co-occurrences of concepts in the same sentences, in the expec-tation that such information will facilitate sense resolution.The value of such analyses will guide us in deciding howmuch farther to proceed with the construction of a semanticconcordance based on the Brown Corpus.409
