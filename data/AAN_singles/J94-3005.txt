Commentary on Lowe and MazaudonSteven Lee Hartman 1(Southern Illinois University)The Reconstruction E gine (RE) described by Lowe and Mazaudon takes the linguist'shypotheses about sound correspondences between (on one hand) several presumablyrelated modern languages and (on the other) a reconstruction f their presumed com-mon ancestor language, and it tests these hypotheses against a major portion of thelexicons of the languages.Five advantages of the program especially are worthy of note: (1) It can tabulateresults for several languages at once.
(2) It can project correspondences both "down-stream" and "upstream."
(3) Its initial formation of cognate sets is not encumbered bysemantic information (although word glosses are kept available for the user eventuallyto judge the plausibility of matches)--this ensures that the process does not overlookviable matches imply because of "small" semantic differences ('shoulder'/'thigh') ornonuniform rendering of glosses ('soak'/'wet,' 'snow'/'neige').
(4) It overcomes someof the dangers of losing potential matches to nonuniform parsing of syllable structure,by considering a variety of possible segmentations, based on partially overlappingcategories (rhyme, vowel, etc.).
(5) It incorporates "flexibility toward irregularity" (asin the use of "fuzzy" matching) as a kind of wider deployment of the net to catchcognates and as a way of keeping the process open to new discoveries.
The authorsrightly imply that the difference between regular and irregular sound change is notmarked by a clearly drawn line based on simple observation, but rather depends ontheoretical judgments made by the linguist.Meanwhile, the applicability of the RE in its present form is perhaps limited in afundamental way by looking only at sound correspondences between two stages ("an-cestor" and "descendant"), rather than dealing with the undoubtedly multi-layeredseries of changes (not to mention the possibility that those changes may overlap inhistory, compete for input, and/or apply in different orders for different words).
Thismay be merely the quibble of one who has worked mainly with a documented ancestorlanguage (Latin), having had less experience with the problems of reconstructing anancestor language.
From this perspective, the limitations of a two-level table of corre-spondences can be brought into focus by considering for example the table that wouldbe necessary to account for just the segment /o / in  Modern French (derived from dif-ferent Latin ancestor sequences in haut, eau, h6tel, chevaux, chateau, etc.).
The authorsintend, rightly, to deal with the "chronologization f changes" in future refinementsof the RE.The notation system and parsing algorithms of the RE seem well suited to thephonotactics of "monosyllabic" languages such as the Tamang of the examples pre-sented.
With data from other language families, with polysyllabic strings and morecomplex consonant clusters, it might seem that the processing time to consider all pos-sible correspondences could increase geometrically; but other researchers (e.g., JohnHewson \[this issue\]--working with the very different morpheme structure of Algo-nquian languages) have developed techniques for resolving that problem.1 Department of Foreign Languages, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL 62901,418
