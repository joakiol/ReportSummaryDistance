The system, which has been implemented in  UT-LISP,p rov ides  fac i l i t i es  fo r  per forming the fo l low ing  tasks :  natur -e l  language pars ing  accord ing  to context - f ree  and t rans foraat -i ona l  grammars; d tsembt~at ion  of  word senses  by pat tern --d i rec ted  in fe rence!

I t  appears that  the lack  ofmodu lar i ty  of  these  systems i s  due to the fac t  that  the i rsyntact i c  exper t i se  i s  not -oonven?ehtly located  in  one rout -ine  but ,  in  e f fec t ,  d i s t r ibuted  throughout  he ent i re  p ro~am.In  the system descr ibed  here ,  modu lar i za t ion  i s  ach iev -ed by maklD~ the cont ro l  s t ruc ture  la rge ly  t ransparent ,  i ce .by a l low ing  i t  to  res ide  in  the  parser?The method, in  a nutshe l l ,  i s  th i s :  the pa~ssr  outputsa phrase s t ruc ture  t ree ,  or ,  i f  the analyzed sentence  i ss t ruc tura l ly  ambiguous, a l i s t  o f  severa l  phrase s t ruc ture- 214  -t rees .
A t ree  fo r  a sentence  i s  generated  in  bot tom up fash ionunder  the  cont ro l  o f  context - f ree  ru les  and res t r i c ted  context -- sens i t ive  ru les .
The la t te r  cons is t  o f  tes ts  and t ree -mod i -fy ing  funct ions .
The context -sens i t ive  tes ts  inspect  theimmediate  env i ronment  o f  a node about  to  be  entered  in to  thet ree .
Depend ing  on the  outcome o f  such  tes ts ,  the  t ree ,mod i fy -ing  funct ions  can  change par t ia l l y  const ructed  parse  t rees .The in ter io r  nodes  o f  the  t ree  are  occup ied  by funct ions  cor -respond ing  to  t rans format iona l  and/or  semant ic  ru les ,  and thelea f  nodes  are  occup ied  by the  d ic t ionary  ent r ies  o f  the  wordsin  the  sur face  s t r ing .
S ince  L ISP ,  un l i ke  o ther  h igh  leve llanguages ,  makes no d i s t inc t ion  between programs and datas t ruc tures ,  the  t ree  generated  by the  parser  can  be  ia~ned ia te -l y  executed  as  a program.
The t ree ,  in terpreted  as  program,const i tu tes  the  cont ro l  s t ruc ture  re fer red  to  above ,  and  go-yarns  the  semant ic  in terpretat ion  o f  the  sentence  whose s t ruct -u re  i t  re f lec ts .As can  be seen  f rom th is  very  rough descr ip t ion ,  cont ro li ssues  invo lved  in  process ing  natura l  language text  a re  in -deed  la rge ly  taken  care  o f  by the  syntact i c  component .
However,to  e l iminate  semant ica l ly  un in terpretab le  parses  and to  he lpreso lve  subt le  syntact i c  ambigu i t ies ,  the  parser  must  occas ion-a l l y  co~uicate  w i th  the  semant ic  component .The parser  a t tempts  to  e l iminate  the  overhead incur redby pure  top  down (TD) o r  bot tom up (UP) a lgor i thms.
TD a lgo -r i thms may have  to  do a lo t  o f  backt rack ing  because  o f  wrong-ly  p red ic ted  goa ls .

Both  backt rack -ing  an~ the  generat ion  o f  a l l  poss ib le  BU in terpretat ions  canbe avo ided  by su i tab ly  combin ing  TD and  BU s t ra teg ies"  TDexpectat ions  based  on the  grammar i t se l f  and  on what has  beenparsed  so fa r  gu ide  and const ra in  the  BU search ,  wh i le  BUresu l ts  a re  used  a t  once  to  re fu te  o r  conf i rm TD expectat ions .
/- 215  -The parser  i s  descr ibed  and cont ras ted  w i th  severa lother TD and BU parsers.The most notable features of the operation of the par-ser are the follov~ng, As the sentence is traversed from leftto right, TD expectations are  associated with each positionin the sentence.
Each word in the sentence is thought of aslylnE between a beginnlng and an ending position, so that thei-th word lies between positions i-I and i, Nodes are builtonly when they agree with prior expectations and when theymeet additional context-sensitive tests.At each moment, the parser attempts to keep the forestof partial trees as shallow as possible.
After the input wordshave been processed from left to right, the roots of thetrees constructed so far are visited in alternating right toleft and left to right order.
With each pass the height ofsome trees in the parse forest increases until the root forthe entire sentence is built.- 216  -
