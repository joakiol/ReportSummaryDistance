Naval Ocean Systems CenterBeth Sundheim, P.I.The Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC)is supporting DARPA's naturallanguage research program in the area of test and evaluation.
Preparations arebeing made for a task-oriented evaluation of text understanding systems,building off the natural anguage contractors' familiarity with texts taken fromnaval messages and NOSC's previous experience in carrying out systemevaluations.
The objective of the work is to devise an evaluation plan that willsatisfy the needs for characterizing the current state of the art in theory- andimplementation-independent ways and for setting baselines against whichprogress can be measured.Sets of texts have been collected to use as development (i.e.
training) and testdata, and explanatory documentation them has been prepared.
The task tobe performed, a simulated database update task, has been defined, andsamples of expected outputs have been prepared from texts in thedevelopment set.
An overall evaluation plan and schedule have been set.Arrangements are being made to host MUCK-II (Message UnderstandingConference 1/) in June 1989, where participants in the evaluation will meet todiscuss the results and critique the test design.In FY90 NOSC plans to continue facilitating evaluation efforts, to determineuseful new classes of naval texts to use in research and evaluation, tocompile, analyze and distribute such texts, and to investigate opportunities fortransitioning research into applications.
It might be especially useful tocompile a corpus for spoken language systems of voice reports (spoken navalmessages) and corresponding written reports.195
