REPRESENTATION OF FEATURE SYSTEMS IN A NON-CONNECTIONISTMOLECULAR MACHINEL~z I6  K6im~nInstitute of Linguist icsHungarian Academy of SciencesBudapest I., P.O.Box 19.H-1250 HUNGARYABSTRACTThis paper is part of an enterprisewhose aim is to represent l inguisticknowledge in the form of a molecularmachine (a dynamic network).
That is, themolecules of the network not only store,but also send, receive, and processinformation.
It is claimed that such anetwork can be conceived of as a model ofthe coal it ion structure of aconnectionist network.
The paperdescribes how the class of featuresystems cal led unary feature hierarchies(whose importance is supported byphonological theory but will not beargued for in the paper) can berepresented in the molecular machine.INTRODUCTIONOf the various branches of modernl inguistic theory, phonology, as usual,was the first one to come up with reallyrestr ict ive theories of features andfeature systems, largely supported byempirical evidence coming from the studyof a legion of l inguistic phenomena.Phonology wil l  most probably remain mainsource of evidence as far as thefunctioning of feature-based cognit iveprocesses is concerned.The present paper sets out to outl inehow a part icular kind of feature system,close to several recent theories ofphonological features, can be representedin connectionist networks.
However, sincesome of the mechanisms involved,serial ity and synchronization inparticular, fall outside the scope of theexisting connectionist networks, a non-connectionist model simulating would-beserial connectionist networks wil l  beused instead.
The automaton described inthe paper is able to unify featurestructures as programs to be run on themachine itself.UNARY FEATURE HIERARCHIESThe feature systems under scrutinycan be termed unary feature hierarchies.The underlying concept is close to the'feature geometry' approach toautosegmental phonology (Clements 1985)in that a feature specif icat ion consistsof features appearing on tiers, andfeatures on adjacent tiers can be l inkedby associat ion ~ines.
Tiers are orderedin a mult i -dimensional  space, and the setof features that may appear on apart icular t ier is predefined.
Unarity,on the other hand, means that a featureeither appears within a given 'span' (oftime) or it does not (instead of havingdifferent values); the absence of afeature simply means lack of informationor undersDecif ication.
Features can onlybe l inked to specif ied slots; on theother hand, t iers are adjacent tofeatures rather than to tiers (hence theuse of hierarchv instead of qeometry);that is, the fol lowing conf igurat ion maybe ruled out if the H tier is adjacent toF but not to G:F/G t ier .... F .... G ....l IH tier .... H .... H ....Figure I.
This conf igurat ion may be ruledout.Unarity is opposed to tradit ionalbinary feature systems (with a marked '+'and an unmarked '-' value for eachfeature) and to ternary systems (with amarked '+', an unmarked '-', and anunspecif ied '0' value), while featuregeometries (and hierarchies) replace theold-fashioned 'feature bundle'conception, in which each segmentconsisted of an unordered set of feature--value pairs.

Sample feature system.In terms of the above, the features ofplural  nouns and D lura l ia  tantum areidentical,  in spi te of the l inkproh ib i t ion  concern ing  the 'Non-Singular'feature of the la t ter .CONNECTIONIST MODEL OF FEATURESYSTEMSObviously,  the presence  of a featurein a segment  cor responds  to a re la t ive lyh igh act ivat ion  level of a node or acoa l i t ion  of nodes in a connect ion is tnetwork.
The vert ica l  geometry  of t iersdetermines  the poss ib i l i t i es  of l inking;the essent ia l  funct ion of l inks is tosynchron ize  the act ivat ion  of features,but they also express  thei r  dependencyrelat ions.
Thus assoc ia t ion  l inescorespond to the fact that  the act ivat ionof a node or coa l i t ion  contro ls  theact ivat ion  of another  node or coal i t ion.Final ly,  l ink proh ib i t ions  can berepresented as the inh ib i t ion ofpar t i cu la r  t iers.
The ad jacency  of t ierswi l l  co r respond to super-coa l i t ions ,  i.e.features on ad jacent  t iers  are featureswhose act ivat ion  can be synchron ized atall.In our  present  knowledge,  none of theex is t ing connect ion is t  networks can learnand encode the sequent ia l  act ivat ion  ofnodes or coa l i t ions  of nodes, a lbei t  theorgan izat ion  of human memory is mostprobab ly  h igh ly  ser ia l ized.
To overcomethis de f i c iency  (and for other  reasons aswell) we des igned a molecu lar  machine(cf.
Ka lm~n and Kornai  1985) to model  thefunct ion ing of a sequent ia l  connect ion is tnetwork.In this machine,  each molecu leconta ins  a more or less stable p iece ofknowledge encod ing the coa l i t ionst ructure  it par t i c ipates  in, in the formof a layout of the sur round ing  network.299Molecules are able to send messagesto each other; a message has the sameform as the pieces of information storedin the molecules, i.e.
it is a directedgraph representing a substructure ofmolecules with their dependencies.
When amolecule receives a message, it unif iesthe message with its own map, and itforwards the result ing information.
Theultimate addressees are the 'outputmolecules', which can perform extraactions when receiving a properlyaddressed message.
That is, the messageacts as a program that will, after somemodif icat ions it undergoes, activate aset of output molecules in a wel l -def inedorder?
Modif icat ions correspond to theeffects of the rules stored in themolecules on the path of the message.One of the most importantcharacterist ics of the messages sent (andother maps) is that they may containmissing steps, i.e.
dist inguished nodesencoding lack of information concerningthe way between two nodes.
Missing stepscan be el iminated by unification,provided that the required path isspecif ied in the map of a processingmolecule.
This mechanism corresponds tothe function of 'super-coalitions', i.e.the synchronization and sequencing of theactivation of otherwise dist inctcoalitions.INFORMATION PROCESSING WITHTHE MOLECULAR MACHINEThe basic operation performed by  themolecular machine is a kind ofunification, di f fer ing from thecorresponding operation used inunif icat ion-based grammars by virtue ofthe dif ferences in the feature structuresand their representations.
Since the mapgraphs of the molecular machine containno node variables, unif icat ionessential ly means the el imination ofmissing steps.
Missing steps encode bothalternative and conjunctive relations:A BVC DFigure 6.
Sample directed graph withmissing step.The missing step (the asterisk) in Figure6 can only be el iminated by supplying apath from A and B to either C or D, e.g.by unifying the graph in Figure 6 withthe following:A BCFigure 7.
Sample directed graph withoutmissing step.Figure 7 is also the result ing graph.
Anyother uni f icat ion wil l  pr, vide a partialsolution at best.The control function of the directedgraphs in question is due to the factthat the addressed molecules are able toreduce the messages they receive.
Forexample, in the case of the graph onFigure 7, both molecules A and B wil lremove their addresses from the top levelbefore forwarding the graph.
The graph onFigure 6, on the other hand, wil l  beunable to activate any of the addresseesbecause of the missing step it contains.The uni f icat ion and control functionsof the molecular machine together definea part icular conception of phonologicalrule systems, which can be argued for onindependent grounds as well.
Under thisapproach, the function of a phonologicalrule system is essential ly to resolveproblems arising from morphologicalprocesses, i.e.
to fix i l l - formedrepresentations result ing from aff ixationby supplying missing features (e.g.
invowel harmony), l inking or del inkingfeatures according to the derived context(e.g.
in voice assimilation).
Note thatdel inking in the present form of themachine consists of adding an inhibitoryl ink leading to the feature to bedelinked.FURTHER PLANS, IMPLEMENTATIONIt is far from evident that syntacticand semantic rule systems should carryout operations similar to those inphonological rules.
On the other hand,the operation of the molecular machineare general enough to eventual lyencompass syntactic and semanticprocesses such as recognit ion andcompletion of syntactic patterns,inference making through unification,etc.
Some of these operations areoutl ined in Kalman and Kornai (1985) andKalman (1986).300A small molecular machine isimplemented in Zoltan Schreter's (FPSE,Geneva University) CNS connectionistsimulation system running on OlivettiM24/M28 PCs.
However, owing to thecapacity of the machines (and of TLCLisp, in which the system has beenwritten) the number of molecules isextremely limited, and the performanceobtained is rather poor.REFERENCESClements, George N. 1985.
