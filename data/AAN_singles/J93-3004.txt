Squibs and DiscussionsCo-occurrence Patterns among Collocations:A Tool for Corpus-Based Lexical KnowledgeAcquisitionDoug las  Biber ?Northern Arizona University1.
IntroductionOne of the main problems for applied natural anguage processing is gaps in thelexicon, including missing words and word senses, and inadequate descriptions ofword use in context.
Traditional lexicography has similar concerns.
The availability oflarge, on-line text corpora provides a straightforward tool for enlarging the stock ofwords included in a lexicon.
The identification of additional word senses and uses ismore problematic, however.Much recent lexicographic work employs concordances generated from text cor-pora for these purposes.
While this approach provides a more solid empirical basisthan traditional lexicographic approaches (which depend on the manual collection andsorting of citation index cards), concordances can actually provide too much data.
Forexample, a concordance for the word certain produced on an 11.6 million-word sub-sample of the Longman/Lancaster Corpus generated 3,424 entries; a concordance forthe word right from the same subcorpus generated 7,619 entries.
Simply determiningthe number of different senses in a database of this size is a daunting task; to accu-rately group different uses or rank them in order of importance is not really feasiblewithout the use of additional tools.One such tool is to simply sort concordance lines according to their differentcollocational patterns.
Entries can be sorted according to their collocates on both the leftand the right.
Many of these collocational pairs show a strong relation to a particularword sense (e.g., contrast right ear and right away), and thus analysis of collocationalrelations has become an important tool for lexical knowledge acquisition (see Sinclair1991; Smadja 1991; Zernik 1991).In addition, there are statistical tools that can help determine the relative strengthof collocational relations.
For example, Church and Hanks (1990) describe the use of themutual information index for this purpose (cf.
Calzolari and Bindi 1990).
Church et al(1991) further describe the use of t-scores to assess the extent of the differences betweenthe collocational patterns of nearly synonymous words.
These tools are important inthat the strongest collocational ssociations often represent different word senses, andthus 'they provide a powerful set of suggestions to the lexicographer for what needsto be accounted for in choosing a set of semantic tags' (Church and Hanks 1990, p. 28).However, such tools do not directly characterize word senses or even provide anydirect indication of the number of different senses that a word has.

Box 6032, Flagstaff, AZ 86011-6032;biber@nauvax.ucc.nau.edu.1 Church and Hanks (1990; Church et al 1991) thus emphasize the importance of human judgment usedin conjunction with these tools.Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3tools are not designed to assess the relations among various collocations, addressingthe question of which clusters of collocations reflect similar underlying senses.
2The present paper discusses the use of factor analysis (a multivariate statisticaltechnique) as a tool for such research questions.
In particular, this technique con-tributes three types of information ot provided by other complementary techniques:1) an indication of the number of major senses and/or uses associated with a word;2) an indication of the way that various collocational patterns relate to one anotherin marking word senses and uses; and 3) a fuller analysis of the senses themselves,based on interpretation of the shared bases underlying the groupings of collocations.2.
MethodologyThe use of multivariate statistical techniques for lexical knowledge acquisition wasfirst proposed by Bindi et al (1991).
In particular, that study illustrates the use ofMultidimensional Scaling (MDS) to identify the relations among semantically relatedword types (e.g., piccolo, corto, breve) and their collocates (or 'word mates').
The inputdata for this approach are mutual information indexes computed over the domain ofan entire corpus.
Separate association indexes are computed for each pair of targetword types (e.g., piccolo and corto) and for all of the word types in relation to various'word-mates' (e.g., piccolo with bambino).
This entire matrix is then analyzed by MDS tocluster word types and word-mates along a few underlying dimensions, providing ageometric representation f the semantic domain in question (in this case, 'smallness').Word types are clustered together to the extent hat they are associated with the sameword-mates.
The geometric distance between a word-mate and its word type reflectsthe strength of the relevant association index, and word-mates are clustered togetherto the extent hat they are associated with the same word types (see Bindi et al 1991).Factor analysis differs from MDS in that the input data are computed over thedomain of individual texts, rather than over the domain of the entire corpus.
Fur-ther, the application of factor analysis here is to identify basic word senses and usesassociated with a single word rather than the relations among a set of semanticallyrelated words.
This statistical technique identifies the groupings of collocations thattend to co-occur frequently in texts.
If we assume that texts are topically coherent,it follows that groupings of collocations that co-occur frequently in texts will oftenreflect different underlying word senses.This approach is illustrated here through analyses of two words--certain andright--in an 11.66 million-word subsample of the Longman/Lancaster corpus.
Thiscorpus is designed to represent a wide range of text varieties (see Summers 1991),including ten major topical categories (e.g., natural science, social science, fiction),three mediums (books, periodicals, and ephemera), and three levels (technical/literary,lay/middle, and popular).The first step in the analysis is to identify the major collocational patterns for thetarget word.
In the present analysis, this was done simply by computing the frequencyof all collocational pairs over the entire corpus; collocations that occurred more than30 times were considered to be important word associations and thus included in thesubsequent analyses.
3 For certain, 20 left collocates and 14 right collocates met this2 Church et al (1991, pp.
150-155) show how word association measures computed over the domain ofdiscourse units (rather than bigrams or SVO triples) can be used to identify topical domains forinformation retrieval purposes.3 There are more sophisticated approaches that could be used to identify the major collocationalassociations.
First, mutual information indexes could be computed to identify strong word associations532Douglas Biber Co-occurrence Patternscriterion; for right, there were 24 left col locates and  53 r ight  col locates meet ing  thecriterion.The next step was  to count  the f requency of each col locat ion pa i r  in each textof the corpus.
On ly  texts longer  than 20,000 words  were  inc luded at this stage, toinsure adequate  representat ion  of the re levant  co-occurr ing col locations.
Two hundredforty-s ix texts f rom the subcorpus  met  this condit ion.Factor  analys is  was then used to ident i fy  the group ings  of col locat ional  pairsthat tended to co-occur in texts.
Factor  analys is  bu i lds  upon pa i rw ise  correlat ionsamong the var iables to ident i fy  a reduced set of under ly ing  constructs,  or  ' factors' .
4Each var iable  has some correlat ion,  or  ' loading, '  w i th  each factor, but  on ly  the largerload ings  are impor tant  in interpret ing the under ly ing  constructs.In the present  case, the var iab les  are the f requency counts for each col locat ionalpair.
The factors thus represent  the col locat ional  pa i rs  that tend to co-occur f requent lyin texts.
G iven  the fo l lowing assumpt ions ,  it was hypothes ized  that the factor group-ings of col locat ional  pairs  wou ld  represent  di f ferent under ly ing  word  senses; the re-qu i red assumpt ions  are: 1) that each col locat ional  pa i r  tends to have a st rong relat ionto a s ingle word  sense, and 2) that texts are topical ly  coherent,  and that words  wi l ltherefore tend to be used in a single sense throughout  he domain  of a text.
To theextent that these assumpt ions  are accurate,  col locat ional  pairs  shou ld  co-occur in textsas ref lect ions of the same under ly ing  word  sense.
The pi lot  analyses  presented  inthe fo l lowing sect ion indicate that these assumpt ions  do commonly  ho ld  in natura ld iscourse.3.
Co-occurrence Patterns among Col locat ions for certain and rightThe factor analyses  for the col locates of certain and right are summar ized  in Tables 1and 2 respectively.
5 The tables present  he factor load ings  for each col locat ional  pairon each factor.
Load ings  can range f rom 0.0 to p lus  or minus  1.0.
A load ing  of 0.0that are not necessarily frequent in their overall occurrence.
In addition, word associations ata distanceshould be included.4 See Biber (1988) for a fuller discussion of factor analysis and its application to the computationalanalysis of linguistic variation.
There are three main corpus design considerations required by this useof factor analysis.
First, the analysis requires long, connected texts, to provide ample opportunity forthe (co-)occurrence of a range of collocational pairs; the analysis here excludes all texts shorter than20,000 words.
Shorter texts would often contain few tokens of a few collocational pairs and would thusnot adequately represent the correlations among collocations.
Composite texts are not acceptablebecause they violate the assumption of topical coherence.
Second, the analysis requires a large numberof texts.
A general rule of thumb for factor analysis is that there should be five times as many texts asvariables (Gorsuch 1983).
Thus, there should be a minimum of 240 texts included for the final factoranalysis of right, which is based on 48 collocational pairs.
(The final factor analysis of certain is basedon 25 collocational pairs and would thus require only 150 texts.)
The sub-corpus used here, with 246coherent texts longer than 20,000 words, meets these criteria.
Finally, the corpus used for analysis mustrepresent the full range of variability with respect to the collocational patterns.
Corpora that arerestricted topically or restricted to a few registers are not adequate for analyses of this type, becausethe reduced variability results in reduced correlations, which in turn result in a skewed and unreliablefactorial structure (cf.
Biber 1990).5 I used a common factor analysis with a Promax rotation.
Scree plots of the eigenvalues andconsideration f the two-, three-, and four-factor solutions indicated that the three-factor solution wasthe most adequate for the analysis of certain, while the four-factor solution was the most adequate forthe analysis of right.
Variables that had communalities K .10 were dropped from the final analysis; 25collocational pairs were included in the final analysis of certain, and 48 pairs in the analysis of right.In the analysis of certain, the first factor accounts for 21.4% of the shared variance, while the threefactors together account for 39.4% of the shared variance.
Factors 1 and 2 have a correlation of .30,while the other inter-factor correlations are negligible.
In the analysis of right, the first factor accountsfor 22.1% of the shared variance, while the four factors together account for 51.3% of the sharedvariance; the only appreciable inter-factor correlation is between Factors 2 and 3 (.43).533Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3Table 1Factorial structure of the collocates of certain.FACTOR1 FACTOR2Major Factor 1 CollocationFACTOR3in certain 0.74077 0.07110 -0.05468certain other 0.68352 -0.09431 -0.05035of certain 0.61015 0.32266 -0.05660and certain 0.58373 -0.12996 -0.11671certain of 0.56773 -0.10960 0.22018certain 0.49718 0.09231 -0.12760certain 0.46448 0.10248 0.05560 !there BE certain 0.32284 -0.03747 0.07349certain type(s) 0.31556 0.06191 -0.10855on certain 0.29994 0.27142 -0.01401with certain 0.29908 0.24981 -0.07999that certain 0.27814 0.18763 0.01827Major Factor 2 Collocationscertain extent -0.21295 0 .91065 0.01578certain aspect(s) -0.08321 0.90127 0.01704to certain 0.15364 0.71625 0.00352under certain 0.02432 0.44979 -0.02374for certain 0.40779 0.44289 0.05722a certain 0.01796 0.35752 0.01724by certain 0.22450 0 .33351 0.02019Major Factor 3 Collocationscertain that 0.13828 0.00372 0.87341certain -0.11735 0.03704 0.46955it BE certain -0.04318 0.00884 0.42112make/made certain 0.02137 0.00068 0.32323I /we BE certain -0.08456 -0.06629 0.29203quite certain -0.08470 0.04002 0.23607shows that the variable has no relation to the pool of shared variance accounted forby the factor, while a loading of 1.0 represents a perfect correlation.Each factor comprises a number  of collocational pairs with relatively large load-ings, while the remaining collocations have small or negligible associations.
Tables 1and 2 are organized so that the collocations having large loadings on each of the factorsare grouped together.Consider first the factorial structure for certain, presented in Table 1.
The first 12collocations listed on the table have large loadings on Factor 1, with generally smallloadings on the other two factors (e.g., in certain has a loading of .74 on Factor 1, butloadings near 0.0 on Factors 2 and 3).
The second group of 7 collocations have thelargest loadings on Factor 2; while the last group of 6 collocations have large loadingson Factor 3.

Factor 3 is the easiest ointerpret: all six of the collocational pairs grouped on this factor represent contextswhere certain functions to mark certainty.
In all of these cases, certain is a predicativeadjective, often taking a that complement clause (e.g., I am quite certain that... ).In contrast, certain does not have the sense of certainty in any of the collocationalpairs grouped on Factors 1 and 2; rather the collocations grouped on these factorsfunction to identify an unspecified (and perhaps unknown) subset of some largergroup (e.g., in certain cases, a certain person).
7The difference between Factors 1 and 2 isless obvious.
An examination of the concordance listings for the associated collocations,however, shows that there is an important, systematic difference between the twofactors: the collocations on Factor 1 tend to modify concrete, physical or tangiblereferents, while the collocations on Factor 2 tend to modify abstract referents.
Thus,consider the examples from both factors listed in Table 3.Factor I collocations tend to be more concrete, often characterizing physical objects(e.g., towns, adults, trees, raw vegetables).
In contrast, Factor 2 collocations modify moreabstract referents, such as basic truths, general values, and assumptions.
The collocationfor certain has a loading of about .40 on both Factor 1 and Factor 2, and it shows bothkinds of pattern; for example, it modifies users and speakers, similar to other Factor 1collocations, and it modifies responsibilities, ymptoms, and deficiencies, similar to otherFactor 2 collocations.The factorial structure for right, presented in Table 2, similarly shows a highly sys-tematic patterning among collocations.
Factor I represents the positional or directionaluse of right; in fact, many of these collocations refer to body parts on the right side.Factor 2 is equally transparent but represents a word sense that does not receivemuch attention in most dictionaries: right marking 'immediately,' 'directly,' or 'exactly.
'There are a large number of collocational pairs having this sense (e.g., right there, rightback, right now), and Factor 2 shows that there is a strong tendency for these collocationsto co-occur in texts.
On first consideration, the collocation go~went right seems to be anexception to the general pattern underlying Factor 2 (representing the Factor 1 senseof 'to the right' instead).
Examination of the concordance listings for this collocationshows, however, that it almost always occurs with the Factor 2 sense?

All right is commonly used to mark agreement or to mark a discoursejuncture.
Right can occur by itself with these same functions (hence the collocationsof right with preceding and following punctuation).
The collocation that's right alsotypically marks agreement to a previous assertion.
Right then appears to represent ause of the Factor 2 pattern meaning 'immediately,' but this collocation also frequentlyoccurs as a response in the context all right then.
The collocation ot right indicates alack of correctness or normalcy, as in all was not right with the mirror and something wasnot right close-up.Finally, Factor 4 seems to represent a stylistically marked use of right at the end ofa clause, with no intervening punctuation before the following clause.
Collocations ofthis type commonly have all right, right, or that's right preceding a clause, as in all rightyou found the..., all right I pushed .

Conc lus ionThe two pilot analyses presented here indicate that this approach can be a useful toolfor the semi-automatic identification ofunderlying word senses and uses.
Further, bothanalyses produced unanticipated but systematic results, indicating that this approachcan provide a useful complementary perspective totraditional lexicographic methods.These analyses could be extended in several ways.
First, statistics uch as themutual information i dex could be used to help identify the set of relevant collocationsto be included in the factor analysis.
Second, the corpus could be pre-processed by a537Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 3grammatical tagger, making the collocations sensitive to grammatical category.
Finally,lexical associations at a distance should be included in the analysis.
In this regard, theanalyses here have been restricted: they consider only collocations of adjacent words,with no regard for grammatical category, and with the input data identified simply onthe basis of absolute frequency.
However, even with these restrictions, factor analysisappears to be a powerful tool for identifying underlying patterns among collocations,reflecting some of the major senses and uses of a word.ReferencesBiber, Douglas (1988).
