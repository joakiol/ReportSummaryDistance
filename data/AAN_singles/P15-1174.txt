Issues can arise during com-parison of quality estimation predictionscore distributions and gold label distribu-tions, however.
In this paper, we providean analysis of methods of comparison andidentify areas of concern with respect towidely used measures, such as the abilityto gain by prediction of aggregate statisticsspecific to gold label distributions or byoptimally conservative variance in predic-tion score distributions.
As an alternative,we propose the use of the unit-free Pear-son correlation, in addition to providing anappropriate method of significance testingimprovements over a baseline.
Compo-nents of WMT-13 and WMT-14 quality es-timation shared tasks are replicated to re-veal substantially increased conclusivity insystem rankings, including identificationof outright winners of tasks.1 IntroductionMachine Translation (MT) Quality Estimation(QE) is the automatic prediction of machine trans-lation quality without the use of reference trans-lations (Blatz et al, 2004; Specia et al, 2009).Human assessment of translation quality in theoryprovides the most meaningful evaluation of sys-tems, but human assessors are known to be incon-sistent and this causes challenges for quality es-timation evaluation.
For instance, there is a gen-eral lack of consensus both with respect to whatprovides the most meaningful gold standard rep-resentation, as well as best method of compari-son of gold labels and system predictions.
For ex-ample, in the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Ma-chine Translation (WMT), which since 2012 hasprovided a main venue for evaluation of systems,sentence-level systems were evaluated with re-spect to three distinct gold standard representa-tions and each of those compared to predictionsusing four different measures, resulting in a totalof 12 different system rankings, 6 identified as of-ficial rankings (Bojar et al, 2014).Although the aim of several methods of evalua-tion is to provide more insight into performance ofsystems, this also produces conflicting results andraises the question which method of evaluation re-ally identifies the system(s) or method(s) that bestpredicts translation quality.
For example, an ex-treme case in WMT-14 occurred for sentence-levelquality estimation for English-to-Spanish.
In eachof the 12 system rankings, many systems were tiedand this resulted in a total of 22 official winningsystems for this language pair.
Besides leaving po-tential users of quality estimation systems at a lossas to what the best system may be, a large numberof inconclusive evaluation methodologies is alsolikely to lead to confusion about which evaluationmethods should be applied in general in QE re-search, or worse still, researchers simply choos-ing the methodology that favors their system fromamong the many different methodologies.In this paper, we provide an analysis of each ofthe methodologies used in WMT and widely ap-plied to evaluation of quality estimation systemsin general.
Our analysis reveals potential flaws inexisting methods and we subsequently provide de-tail of a single method that overcomes previouschallenges.
To demonstrate, we replicate com-1804ponents of evaluations previously carried out atWMT-13 and WMT-14 sentence-level quality es-timation shared tasks.
Results reveal substantiallymore conclusive system rankings, revealing out-right winners that had not previously been identi-fied.2 Relevant WorkThe Workshop on Statistical Machine Transla-tion (WMT) provides a main venue for evalua-tion of quality estimation systems, in addition tothe rare and highly-valued effort of provision ofpublicly available data sets to facilitate further re-search.
We provide an analysis of current evalu-ation methodologies applied not only in the mostrecent WMT shared task but also widely withinquality estimation research.2.1 WMT-style EvaluationWMT-14 quality estimation evaluation at thesentence-level, Task 1, is comprised of three sub-tasks.
In Task 1.1, human gold labels comprisethree levels of translation quality or ?perceivedpost-edit effort?
(1 = perfect translation; 2 = nearmiss translation; 3 = very low quality translation).A possible downside of the evaluation methodol-ogy applied in Task 1.1 is firstly that the gold stan-dard representation may be overly coarse-grained.Considering the vast range of possible errors oc-curring in translations, limiting the levels of trans-lation quality to only three may impact negativelyon systems?
ability to discriminate between trans-lations of various quality.More importantly, however, the combination ofsuch coarse-grained gold labels (1, 2 or 3) andcomparison of gold labels and system predictionsby mean absolute error (MAE) has a counter-intuitive effect on system rankings, as systems thatproduce continuous predictions are at an advan-tage over those that produce discrete predictionseven though gold labels are also discrete.
Figure1(a) shows discrete gold label distributions for thescoring variant of Task 1.1 in WMT-14 and Figure1(b) prediction distributions for an example sys-tem that was at a disadvantage because it restrictedits predictions to discrete ratings like those of goldlabels, and Figure 1(c) a system that achieves ap-parent better performance (lower MAE) despiteprediction representations mismatching the dis-crete nature of gold labels.Evaluation of the ranking variant of Task 1.1rPost-edit Time 0.36Post-edit Rate 0.69??
?Table 1: Pearson correlation with HTER scores ofpost-edit times (PETs) and post-edit rates (PERs)for WMT-14 Task 1.2 and Task 1.3 gold labels,correlation marked with??
?is significantly greaterat p < 0.001.again includes a significant mismatch betweenrepresentations used as gold labels, which againwere limited to the ratings 1, 2 or 3, while sys-tems were required to provide a total-order rank-ing of test set translations, for example ranks 1-600 or 1-450, depending on language pair.
Evalu-ation methodologies applied to ranking tasks maybe better facilitated by application of more fine-grained gold standard labels that more closely rep-resent total-order rankings of system predictions.Evaluation methodologies applied in Task 1.3employ the more fine-grained post-edit times(PETs) as translation quality gold labels.
PETspotentially provide a good indication of the un-derlying quality of translations, as a translationthat takes longer to manually correct is thoughtto have lower quality.
However, we propose whatmay correspond more directly to translation qual-ity is an alteration of this, a post-edit rate (PER),where PETs are normalized by the number ofwords in translations.
This takes into account thefact that, all else being equal, longer translationssimply take a greater amount of time to post-editthan shorter ones.
To investigate to what degreePERs may correspond better to translation qualitythan PETs, we compute correlations of each withHTER gold labels of translations from Task 1.2.Table 6 reveals a significantly higher correlationthat exists between PER and HTER compared toPET and HTER (p < 0.001) , and we concludetherefore that the PER of a translation provides amore faithful representation of translation qualitythan PET, and convert PETs for both predictionsand gold labels to PERs (in seconds per word) inour later replication of Task 1.3.In Task 1.2 of WMT-14, gold standard labelsused to evaluate systems were in the form of hu-man translation error rates (HTERs) (Snover etal., 2009).
HTER scores provide an effectiverepresentation for evaluation of quality estima-18051 2 3(a) Gold Labels0.00.20.40.60.81.01 2 3(b) System A Predictions0.00.20.40.60.81.0 MAE: 0.6870.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.50.00.20.40.60.81.0(c) System B PredictionsMAE: 0.603Figure 1: WMT-14 English-to-German quality estimation Task 1.1 where mismatched prediction/goldlabels achieves apparent better performance, where (a) gold label distribution; (b) example system disad-vantaged by its discrete predictions; (c) example system gaining advantage by its continuous predictions.tion systems, as scores are individually computedper translation using custom post-edited referencetranslations, avoiding the bias that can occur withmetrics that employ generic reference translations.In our later evaluation, we therefore use HTERscores in addition to PERs as suitable gold stan-dard labels.2.2 Mean Absolute ErrorMean absolute error is likely the most widely ap-plied comparison measure of quality estimationsystem predictions and gold labels, in addition tobeing the official measure applied to scoring vari-ants of tasks in WMT (Bojar et al, 2014).
MAE isthe average absolute difference that exists betweena system?s predictions and gold standard labels fortranslations, and a system achieving a lower MAEis considered a better system.
Significant issuesarise for evaluation of quality estimation systemswith MAE when comparing distributions for pre-dictions and gold labels, however.
Firstly, a sys-tem?s MAE can be lowered not only by individ-ual predictions closer to corresponding gold la-bels, but also by prediction of aggregate statisticsspecific to the distribution of gold labels in the par-ticular test set used for evaluation.
MAE is mostsusceptible in this respect when gold labels havea unimodal distribution with relatively low stan-dard deviation.
For example, Figure 2(a) showstest set gold label HTER distribution for Task 1.2in WMT-14 where the bulk of HTERs are locatedaround one main peak with relatively low variancein the distribution.
Unfortunately with MAE, asystem that correctly predicts the location of themode of the test set gold distribution and centerspredictions around it with an optimally conserva-tive variance can achieve lower MAE and appar-ent better performance.
Figure 2(b) shows a lowerMAE can be achieved by rescaling the originalprediction distribution for an example system toa distribution with lower variance.A disadvantage of an ability to gain in perfor-mance by prediction of such features of a giventest set is that prediction of aggregates is, in gen-eral, far easier than individual predictions.
In ad-dition, inclusion of confounding test set aggre-gates such as these in evaluations will likely leadto both an overestimate of the ability of some sys-tems to predict the quality of unseen translationsand an underestimate of the accuracy of systemsthat courageously attempt to predict the quality oftranslations in the tails of gold distributions, andit follows that systems optimized for MAE canbe expected to perform badly when predicting thequality of translations in the tails of gold label dis-tributions (Moreau and Vogel, 2014).Table 2 shows how MAEs of original predictedscore distributions for all systems participating inTask 1.2 WMT-14 can be reduced by shifting andrescaling the prediction score distribution accord-ing to gold label aggregates.
Table 3 shows thatfor similar reasons other measures commonly ap-plied to evaluation of quality estimation systems,such as root mean squared error (RMSE), that arealso not unit-free, encounter the same problem.2.3 Significance TestingIn quality estimation, it is common to apply boot-strap resampling to assess the likelihood that a de-crease in MAE (an improvement) has occurred bychance.

In addition, since data used forevaluation of quality estimation systems are notindependent, methods of significance testing dif-ferences in performance will be inaccurate unlessthe dependent nature of the data is taken into ac-count.3 Quality Estimation Evaluation byPearson CorrelationThe Pearson correlation is a measure of the linearcorrelation between two variables, and in the caseof quality estimation evaluation this amounts tothe linear correlation between system predictionsand gold labels.
Pearson?s r overcomes the out-lined challenges of previous approaches, such asmean absolute error, for several reasons.
Firstly,Pearson?s r is a unit-free measure with a key prop-erty being that the correlation coefficient is invari-ant to separate changes in location and scale ineither of the two variables.
This has the obviousadvantage over MAE that the coefficient cannotbe altered by shifting or rescaling prediction scoredistributions according to aggregates specific tothe test set.To illustrate, Figure 3 depicts a pair of systemsfor which the baseline system appears to outper-form the other when evaluated with MAE, but thisis only due to the conservative variance in its pre-18070.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00.00.20.40.60.81.0(a) Raw baselineHTER Prediction (raw)HTER Gold (raw)MAE: 0.1480.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.001234567(b) baselineHTERDensityGoldPredictionMAE: 0.148?2 0 2 4?101234 (c) Stand.

Figure 3(e)shows how the prediction distribution of CMU-ISL-FULL, on the other hand, has higher variance,and subsequently higher MAE.
Figures 3(c) and3(f) depict what occurs in computation of the Pear-son correlation where raw prediction and gold la-bel scores are replaced by standardized scores, i.e.numbers of standard deviations from the mean ofeach distribution, where CMU-ISL-FULL in factachieves a significantly higher correlation than thebaseline system at p < 0.001.An additional advantage of the Pearson corre-lation is that coefficients do not change depend-ing on the representation used in the gold standardin the way they do with MAE, making possible acomparison of performance across evaluations thatemploy different gold label representations.
Addi-tionally, there is no longer a need for training andtest representations to directly correspond to oneanother.
To demonstrate, in our later evaluation weinclude the evaluation of systems trained on bothHTER and PETs for prediction of both HTERand PERs.Finally, when evaluated with the Pearson cor-relation significance tests can be applied withoutresorting to randomized methods, in addition totaking into account the dependent nature of dataused in evaluations.The fact that the Pearson correlation is invariantto separate shifts in location and scale of either ofthe two variables is nonproblematic for evaluationof quality estimation systems.
Take, for instance,the possible counter-argument: a pair of systems,one of which predicts the precise gold distribution,and another system predicting the gold distribution+ 1, would unfairly receive the same Pearson cor-relation coefficient.
Firstly, it is just as difficult topredict the gold distribution + 1, as it is to pre-dict the gold distribution itself.
More importantly,however, the scenario is extremely unlikely to oc-cur in practice, it is highly unlikely that a systemwould ever accurately predict the gold distribution+ 1, as opposed to the actual gold distribution un-less training labels were adjusted in the same man-ner, or indeed predict the gold distribution shiftedor rescaled by any other constant value.
It is im-portant to understand that invariance of the Pear-1808son correlation to a shift in location or scale meansthat the measure is only invariant to a shift in loca-tion or scale applied to the entire distribution (ofeither of the two variables), such as the shift inlocation and scale that can be used to boost appar-ent performance of systems when measures likeMAE and RMSE, that are not unit-free, are em-ployed.
Increasing the distance between systempredictions and gold labels for anything less thanthe entire distribution, a more realistic scenario,or by something other than a constant across theentire distribution, will result in an appropriatelyweaker Pearson correlation.4 Quality Estimation SignificanceTestingPrevious work has shown the suitability ofWilliams significance test (Williams, 1959) forevaluation of automatic MT metrics (Graham andBaldwin, 2014; Graham et al, 2015), and, for sim-ilar reasons, Williams test is appropriate for signif-icance testing differences in performance of com-peting quality estimation systems which we detailfurther below.Evaluation of a given quality estimation system,Pnew, by Pearson correlation takes the form ofquantifying the correlation, r(Pnew, G), that ex-ists between system prediction scores and corre-sponding gold standard labels, and contrasting thiscorrelation with the correlation for some baselinesystem, r(Pbase, G).At first it might seem reasonable to perform sig-nificance testing in the following manner whenan increase in correlation with gold labels is ob-served: apply a significance test separately to thecorrelation of each quality estimation system withgold labels, with the hope that the new system willachieve a significant correlation where the base-line system does not.
The reasoning here is flawedhowever: the fact that one correlation is signifi-cantly higher than zero (r(Pnew, G)) and that ofanother is not, does not necessarily mean that thedifference between the two correlations is signif-icant.
Instead, a specific test should be appliedto the difference in correlations on the data.
Forthis same reason, confidence intervals for individ-ual correlations with gold labels are also not use-ful.In psychology, it is often the case that sam-ples that data are drawn from are independent,and differences in correlations are computed onindependent data sets.
In such cases, the Fisherr to z transformation is applied to test for sig-nificant differences in correlations.
Data usedfor evaluation of quality estimation systems arenot independent, however, and this means that ifr(Pbase, G) and r(Pnew, G) are both > 0, the cor-relation between both sets of predictions them-selves, r(Pbase, Pnew), must also be > 0.
Thestrength of this correlation, directly between pre-dictions of pairs of quality estimation systems,should be taken into account using a signifi-cance test of the difference in correlation betweenr(Pbase, G) and r(Pnew, G).Williams test1(Williams, 1959) evaluates thesignificance of a difference in dependent correla-tions (Steiger, 1980).

Systemrankings diverge considerably from original rank-ings, notably the top system according to the Pear-son correlation is tied in fifth place when evaluatedwith MAE.Table 5 shows Pearson correlations of systemsthat took part in Task 1.2 of WMT-14, where goldlabels were again in the form of HTER scores,1Also known as Hotelling-Williams.1809System r MAEDCU-SYMC-rc 0.595 0.135SHEFMIN-FS 0.575 0.124DCU-SYMC-ra 0.572 0.135CNGL-SVRPLS 0.560 0.133CMU-ISL-noB 0.516 0.138CNGL-SVR 0.508 0.138CMU-ISL-full 0.494 0.152fbk-uedin-extra 0.483 0.144LIMSI-ELASTIC 0.475 0.133SHEFMIN-FS-AL 0.474 0.130LORIA-INCTRA-CONT 0.474 0.148fbk-uedin-rsvr 0.464 0.145LORIA-INCTRA 0.461 0.148baseline 0.451 0.148TCD-CNGL-OPEN 0.329 0.148TCD-CNGL-RESTR 0.291 0.152UMAC-EBLEU 0.113 0.170Table 4: Pearson correlation and MAE of systemHTER predictions and gold labels for English-to-Spanish WMT-13 Task 1.1.and to demonstrate the ability of evaluation of sys-tems trained on a representation distinct from thatof gold labels made possible by the unit-free Pear-son correlation, we also include evaluation of sys-tems originally trained on PET labels to predictHTER scores.
Since PET systems also producepredictions in the form of PET, we convert pre-dictions for all systems to PERs prior to compu-tation of correlations, as PERs more closely cor-respond to translation quality.
Results reveal thatsystems originally trained on PETs in general per-form worse than HTER trained systems, and thisis not all that surprising considering the trainingrepresentation did not correspond well to transla-tion quality.
Again system rankings diverge fromMAE rankings with the second best system ac-cording to MAE moved to the initial position.Table 6 shows Pearson correlations for predic-tions of PER for systems trained on either PETsor HTER, and predictions for systems trained onPETs are converted to PER for evaluation.
Sys-tem rankings diverge most for this data set fromthe original rankings by MAE, as the system hold-ing initial position according to MAE moves to po-sition 13 according to the Pearson correlation.Many of the differences in correlation betweensystems in Tables 4, 5 and 6 are small and insteadof assuming that an increase in correlation of onesystem over another corresponds to an improve-ment in performance, we first apply significancetesting to differences in correlation with gold la-bels that exist between correlations for each pairTraining QELabels System r MAEHTER DCU-rtm-svr 0.550 0.134HTER FBK-UPV-UEDIN-wp 0.540 0.129HTER DCU-rtm-tree 0.518 0.140HTER DFKI-svr 0.501 0.143HTER USHEFF 0.432 0.136HTER SHEFF-lite-sparse 0.428 0.150HTER FBK-UPV-UEDIN-nowp 0.414 0.144HTER Multilizer 0.409 0.150PET DCU-rtm-rr 0.350 ?HTER DFKI-svr-xdata 0.349 0.161PET FBK-UPV-UEDIN-wp 0.346 ?PET Multilizer-2 0.331 ?PET Multilizer-1 0.328 ?PET DCU-rtm-svr 0.315 ?HTER baseline 0.283 0.152PET FBK-UPV-UEDIN-nowp 0.279 ?PET USHEFF 0.246 ?PET baseline 0.246 ?PET SHEFF-lite-sparse 0.229 ?PET SHEFF-lite 0.194 ?HTER SHEFF-lite 0.052 0.182Table 5: Pearson correlation and MAE of systemHTER predictions and gold labels for English-to-Spanish WMT-14 Task 1.2 and 1.3 systems trainedon either HTER or PET labelled data.Training QELabels System r MAEHTER FBK-UPV-UEDIN-wp 0.529 ?PET FBK-UPV-UEDIN-wp 0.472 0.972HTER FBK-UPV-UEDIN-nowp 0.452 ?HTER USHEFF 0.444 ?HTER DCU-rtm-svr 0.444 ?HTER DCU-rtm-tree 0.442 ?HTER SHEFF-lite-sparse 0.441 ?PET DCU-rtm-rr 0.430 0.932PET FBK-UPV-UEDIN-nowp 0.423 1.012HTER DFKI-svr 0.412 ?PET USHEFF 0.394 1.358PET baseline 0.394 1.359PET DCU-rtm-svr 0.365 0.915HTER Multilizer 0.361 ?PET SHEFF-lite-sparse 0.337 0.951PET SHEFF-lite 0.323 0.940PET Multilizer-1 0.288 0.993HTER baseline 0.286 ?HTER DFKI-svr-xdata 0.277 ?PET Multilizer-2 0.271 0.972HTER SHEFF-lite 0.011 ?Table 6: Pearson correlation of system PER pre-dictions and gold labels for English-to-SpanishWMT-14 Task 1.2 and 1.3 systems trained on ei-ther HTER or PET labelled data, mean absoluteerror (MAE) provided are in seconds per word.1810rDCU.rtm.svrFBK.UPV.UEDIN.wpDCU.rtm.treeDFKI.svrUSHEFFSHEFF.lite.sparseFBK.UPV.UEDIN.nowpMultilizerDFKI.svr.xdatabaselineSHEFF.liteSHEFF?litebaselineDFKI?svr?xdataMultilizerFBK?UPV?UEDIN?nowpSHEFF?lite?sparseUSHEFFDFKI?svrDCU?rtm?treeFBK?UPV?UEDIN?wpDCU?rtm?svrFigure 4: Pearson correlation between predictionscores for all pairs of systems participating inWMT-14 Task 1.2of systems.5.1 Significance TestsWhen an increase in correlation with gold labelsis present for a pair of systems, significance testsprovide insight into the likelihood that such an in-crease has occurred by chance.
As described indetail in Section 4, the Williams test (Williams,1959), a test also appropriate for MT metrics eval-uated by the Pearson correlation (Graham andBaldwin, 2014), is appropriate for testing the sig-nificance of a difference in dependent correlationsand therefore provides a suitable method of signif-icance testing for quality estimation systems.
Fig-ure 4 provides an example of the strength of cor-relations that commonly exist between predictionsof quality estimation systems.Figure 5 shows significance test outcomes ofthe Williams test for systems originally taking partin WMT-13 Task 1.1, with systems ordered bystrongest to least Pearson correlation with gold la-bels, where a green cell in (row i, column j) signi-fies a significant win for row i system over columnj system, where darker shades of green signifyconclusions made with more certainty.

Test outcomes in Figure 5 re-veal substantially increased conclusivity in sys-tem rankings made possible with the applicationof the Pearson correlation and Williams test, withalmost an unambiguous total-order ranking of sys-tems and an outright winner of the task.Figure 6 shows outcomes of Williams signifi-cance tests for prediction of HTER and Figure 7shows outcomes of tests for PER prediction forWMT-14 English-to-Spanish, again showing sub-stantially increased conclusivity in system rank-ings for tasks.It is important to note that the number of com-peting systems a system significantly outperformsshould not be used as the criterion for rankingcompeting quality estimation systems, since thepower of the Williams test changes depending onthe degree to which predictions of a pair of sys-tems correlate with each other.
A system with pre-dictions that happen to correlate strongly with pre-dictions of many other systems would be at an un-fair advantage, were numbers of significant winsto be used to rank systems.

We provide an alternatemechanism, and since the Pearson correlation is aunit-free measure, it can be applied to evaluationof quality estimation systems avoiding the previ-ous vulnerabilities of measures such as MAE andRMSE.
Advantages also outlined are that trainingand test representations no longer need to directlycorrespond in evaluations as long as labels com-prise a representation that closely reflects transla-tion quality.
We demonstrated the suitability of theproposed measures through replication of compo-nents of WMT-13 and WMT-14 quality estima-tion shared tasks, revealing substantially increasedconclusivity of system rankings.AcknowledgementsWe wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valu-able comments and WMT organizers for the provision of datasets.
