Acquisition System for Arabic Noun MorphologySaleem Abuleil   Khalid Alsamara      Martha EvensInformation System Department          Computer Science DepartmentChicago State University           Illinois Institute of Technology9501 S. King Drive, Chicago, IL 60628    10 West 31 Street, Chicago IL 60616s_abuleil@hotmail.com  kalsamara@hotmail.com        evens@iit.eduAbstractMany papers have discussed differentaspects of Arabic verb morphology.
Some ofthem used patterns; others used patterns andaffixes.
But very few have discussed Arabicnoun morphology particularly for nouns thatare not derived from verbs.
In this paper wedescribe a learning system that can analyzeArabic nouns to produce theirmorphological information and theirparadigms with respect to both gender andnumber using a rule base that uses suffixanalysis as well as pattern analysis.
Thesystem utilizes user-feedback to classify thenoun and identify the group that it belongsto.1 IntroductionA morphology system is the backbone of anatural language processing system.
Noapplication in this field can survive without agood morphology system to support it.
TheArabic language has its own features that are notfound in other languages.
That is why manyresearchers have worked in this area.
Al-Fedaghiand Al-Anzi (1989) present an algorithm togenerate the root and the pattern of a givenArabic word.
The main concept in the algorithmis to locate the position of the root?s letters in thepattern and examine the letters in the sameposition in a given word to see whether the trigraph forms a valid Arabic root or not.Al-Shalabi (1998) developed a systemthat removes the longest possible prefix from theword where the three letters of the root must liesomewhere in the first four or five characters ofthe remainder.
Then he generates somecombinations and checks each one of them withall the roots in the file.
Al-Shalabi reduced theprocessing, but he discussed this from point ofview of verbs not nouns.
Anne Roeck andWaleed Al-Fares (2000) developed a clusteringalgorithm for Arabic words sharing the sameverbal root.
They used root-based clusters tosubstitute for dictionaries in indexing forinformation retrieval.
Beesley and Karttunen(2000) described a new technique forconstructing finite-state transducers thatinvolves reapplying a regular-expressioncompiler to its own output.
They implementedthe system in an algorithm called compile-replace.
This technique has proved useful forhandling non-concatenate phenomena, and theydemonstrate it on Malay full-stem reduplicationand Arabic stem inter-digitations.Most verbs in the Arabic languagefollow clear rules that define their morphologyand generate their paradigms.
Those nouns thatare not derived from roots do not seem to followa similar set of well-defined rules.
Instead thereare groups showing family resemblances.We believe that nouns in Arabic that arenot derived from roots are governed not only byphonological rules but by lexical patterns thatmust be identified and stored for eachnoun.
Like irregular verbs in English their formsare determined by history and etymology, notjust phonology.
Among many other examples,Pinker (1999) points to the survival of pastforms became for become and overcame forovercome, modeled on came for come, whilesuccumb, with the same sound pattern, has aregular past form succumbed.
The same kindsof phenomena are especially apparent for propernouns in Arabic derived from Indian and Persiannames.
Pinker uses examples like this, as well asemerging research in neurophysiology, to arguefor the coexistence of phonological rules andlexical storage of English verb patterns.We believe that further work in Arabiccomputational linguistics requires thedevelopment of a pattern bank for nouns.
Thispaper describes the tool that we have built forthis purpose.
While the set of patterns forcommon nouns in Arabic may soon beestablished, newspapers and other dynamicsources of language will always contain newproper names, so we expect our tool to be apermanent part of our system, even though wemay need it less often as time goes on.2 Nouns in the Arabic LanguageA noun in Arabic is a word that indicates ameaning by itself without being connected withthe notion of time.
There are two main kinds ofnoun: variable and invariable.
Variable nounshave different forms for the singular, the dual,the plural, the diminutive, and the relative.Variable nouns are again divided into two kinds:inert and derived.
The inert noun is not derivedfrom another word, i.e.
it does not refer to averbal root.
Inert nouns are divided into twokinds: concrete nouns (e.g., lion), and abstractnouns (e.g., love).
Derived nouns are taken fromanother word (usually a verb) (e.g.
office); theyhave a root to refer to.
A derived noun is usuallyclose to its root in meaning.
It indicates, besidesthe meaning, the concrete thing that caused itsformation (case of the agent-noun), orunderwent its action (case of the patient-noun),or any other notions of time, place, orinstrument.
The following are the noun types:A genus noun indicates what iscommon to every element of the genus withoutbeing specific to any one of them.
It is the wordnaming a person, an animal, a thing or an idea.Example:   ???
man         ????
bookAn agent noun is a derived nounindicating the actor of the verb or its behavior.
Ithas several patterns according to its root.Example:????
the person who studiesA patient noun is a derived nounindicating the person or thing that undergoes theaction of the verb.
Patient nouns have severalpatterns depending in the verbal root.
Example:?????
the thing that has been studiedAn instrument noun is a nounindicating the tool of an action.
Someinstruments are derived; some are inert.Example: ?????
keyAn adjective is considered to be a typeof noun in traditional Arabic grammar.
Itdescribes the state of the modified noun.Example: ????
beautiful         ???
Mr.?????
Professor          ????
bigAn adverb is a noun that is not derivedand that indicates the place or the time of theaction.
Example:???
Month   ?????
city    ????
northA proper noun is the name of a specificperson, place, organization, thing, idea, event,date, time, or other entity.
Some of them aresolid (inert) nouns some of them are derived[Abuleil and Evens 1998].3 Noun ClassificationIn this paper we focus on the following nouns:genus nouns, agent nouns, instrument nouns,adjectives, proper adjectives (adjectives derivedfrom proper nouns), proper nouns, and adverbs.Some of these nouns are not derived from verbsand some are.
All of these nouns use the samepattern when it comes to the dual form either formasculine or feminine, but there are many waysto form the plural noun.
Some of the nouns haveboth masculine and feminine forms, some ofthem have just feminine forms and some havejust masculine forms.
A few nouns use the sameformat for both the plural and the dual (e.g.??????
teachers used for both dual and plural)For most nouns, when they end with the letter(?
), this indicates the feminine form of the noun,sometimes it does not, but it changes themeaning of the noun completely (e.g.
???
?office, ?????
library).
Sometimes the sameconsonant string with different vowels hasdifferent meanings (e.g.
?????
school, ?????teacher).
Nouns are not like verbs in the Arabiclanguage, there is no clear rule to define themorphological information and generate themorphology paradigms for them.
Instead eachgroup of nouns follows its own pattern.We have classified the nouns into 84groups according to their patterns for singular,plural, masculine and feminine.
We generated amethod for each group to be used to find themorphological information and to form itsparadigm.
Very few of these groups have aunique pattern for plural and singular; and mostof them share the same pattern with othergroups.
Table 1 shows some examples of thesegroups and their patterns.
The digit 9 stands forthe letter ?ayn [?
]?, ?
stands for ?hamzh [?]?
and@ stands for ?ta [?]?
since there is nocorresponding letters in English for these letters.Table 1.

This module displays a mainmenu with two main options: collect nounsfrom documents and find morphologicalinformation.4.2 Type-Finder ModuleThe main function of this module is to read thedocument and find the part of speech of theword: noun, verb, adjective, particle or propernoun by running several tests: Database lookup,particle check, check on adjectives derived fromproper nouns, parse of noun phrases and verbphrases, the affix check and the pattern checkThis module was built by Abuleil and Evens(1998, 2001).
We use this module in our newsystem to find all nouns and extract them fromthe text.Figure 1.
The Acquisition System4.3 DatabaseThe database includes a Classified Noun Tablethat contains each root noun (singular:masculine or feminine) and the number of thegroup to which the noun belongs.
Each time thesystem identifies a new noun it adds its root tothe Classified Noun Table.4.4 Noun Morphology AnalyzerModuleThis is the core of the system, it calls differentmodules and performs different tasks to identifythe noun and find its paradigm.
First, it passesthe noun to the suffix analyzer module to dropthe suffix.
Second, it passes it to the patterngenerator module to find the pattern.
Third, itanalyzes the pattern to see whether it belongs tomore than one group.
It checks the ClassifiedNouns Table and then the suffix/pattern toInterfaceNounMorphologyAnalyzerSuffixAnalyzerPatternGeneratorUser-FeedbackType-FinderDatabaseDBCheckeridentify the group that the noun belongs to.
Ifthe system cannot identify the group then it callsthe user-Feedback module to produce somequestions to be answered by the user to reducethe number of alternatives to one.
Finally,depending on the group the noun belongs to, itgenerates the morphological paradigms fornumber and gender and updates the database.4.5 Suffix Analyzer ModuleThis module identifies the suffix, analyzes it andproduces some lexical information about thenoun like number and gender.
First, it checks ifany pronoun is concatenated with the noun.Second, it checks for a suffix indicating number.Third, it checks for a suffix indicating gender.When the letter (?)
comes at the end ofthe noun there are two cases: it could be a part ofthe noun so we should not drop it, or it could bean extra letter as in relative nouns or when thepronoun is connected to the noun and it shouldbe dropped in this case.
When the noun endswith the letters (??
), most of the time itrepresents dual nouns but some times itrepresents both plural and dual nouns as in thefollowing patterns: mfa9l, fa9l, mf9ull.Sometimes we have to check the pattern also tohelp in analyzing the suffix.
We will handlethese problems as special cases.4.6 Pattern Generator ModuleWe have collected 62 different patterns used forboth masculine and feminine, singular and pluralafter the suffix has been dropped see AppendixA.
We used these patterns to generate a set ofrules to build a finite-state diagram to be used tofind the pattern for any noun.
The input to thismodule is a noun after its suffix has beendropped in the previous step, the output is one ormore patterns.
If more than one pattern is foundwe validate the string by checking the patterntable.The letter (?)
and the letter (?)
at thebeginning of the noun are sometimes the firstcharacters of the noun, but sometimes they areseparate words.
We collected the nouns thatbegin with the letter (?)
and the letter (?)
andsaved them in a file to help us to distinguishbetween these two cases.4.7 Database Checker ModuleThis module identifies any already classifiednoun or any noun derived from it.
It gets thenoun and its pattern from the noun morphologyanalyzer, finds all groups that contain thepattern, finds the singular noun (masculine orfeminine) in each group and uses it to check theClassified Noun Table.
If the noun exists it getsthe group number to which it belongs and passesit to the Noun Morphology Analyzer to generatethe results.
For example the noun (????
?playground) has the pattern (mfa9l).
This patternappears in three different groups.
See table 2.Table 2.

?If the noun itself or any other noun derived fromit has been previously classified we will find itsnoun root (singular noun) in the Classified NounTable.
The module will find the root (singularmasculine) ??????
in the table and will get itsgroup number ?2?
and pass it to NounMorphology Analyzer to find the nounparadigms.4.8 User-Feedback ModuleThis module gets all alternatives (groups) fromthe noun morphology analyzer module.
Itanalyzes them and generates some questions tobe answered by the user.
It gets the answers,analyzes them and finds the group that the nounbelongs to.
The module asks questions like: Isthe noun a singular?
Is the noun a plural?
Doesthe noun have a masculine-singular format?Does the noun have a feminine-singular format?Example:Input:  The noun (?????

row go fromleft to right and from top to bottom.
Use thecolumn name to form questions.
For the ?A1?value use the following question: is the noun a[column name]?
For the ?B1?
use the followingquestion: does the noun have the [column name]format?
Get the answer and drop invalidgroup(s).Group# Sing.Masc.Sing.Fem.PluralMasc.PluralFem.1 -1 0 -1 12 0 -1 -1 1A = ?1?s 0 0 0 2B = ?-1?s 1 1 2 0C = ?

B 1 0 0 1The questions the module generated from theprevious example are:Q1: is the noun plural feminine?Answer: yes // the system drops group#3Q2: does the noun have singular masculineformat?Answer: No  // the system drops group#1Result:Group # 2: The noun (?????
playground) is aplural Feminine.
The singular Masculine formatis ( ????
), the singular Feminine format andplural masculine format are not available for thisnoun.5 ExamplesThe following example shows how the systemworks.
Assume that the input is the noun ( ??????
?their trainer), First the system calls the suffixanalyzer module to drop the extra letter(pronoun: their) at the end ( ?????
+ ??
), replacethe letter (?)
with the letter (?
), generate thenoun (?????
trainer) and some lexical informationabout the noun.Second, it passes the noun (?????
trainer)to the pattern generator module to generate thepattern (mf9l@).
Third, it checks the group tablelooking for this pattern (mf9l@).
Fourth, if morethat one group is found it uses the DatabaseChecker Module to check the Classified NounTable.
Fifth, if the noun does not exist in thetable, it calls the User-Feedback Module toanalyze the groups (all alternatives) and asks theuser some questions to assist in identifying thegroup see Table 4 and Table 5.
The question thatthe module generated is:Question: Does the noun have a masculine-singular format?Answer: YesResult:  drop group # 10 & group # 22Table 4.

?6 ResultsTo test our system we used nouns obtained froma corpus developed by Ahmad Hasnah based ontext given to Illinois Institute of Technology, bythe newspaper, Al-Raya, published in Qatar.
Wehave tested each module in our system: thesuffix analyzer modules, the pattern generatormodule, and the user-Feedback module.
Table 7shows the result of testing the system on 500nouns.Table 7.
Suffix / Pattern / Noun MorphologyAnalyzer#correct#incorrect%correct%incorrectSuffixAnalyzer4901097%3%PatternAnalyzer4712993%8%NounMorphanalyzer4514990.2%9.8%As shown in Table 7 there were ten failurebecause of incorrect suffix analysis and 29 dueto missing patterns.
These missing patterns havenow been added.
The suffix analysis problem ishard to correct because it arises from underlyingambiguities.
If the noun has been classifiedpreviously the system does not have anyproblem to identify it and identify any nounderived from it.The User-Feedback Module found mostof the nouns that the Database Checker Modulefailed to identify.
Table 8 shows a number ofnouns identified by suffix/pattern, nounsidentified by Database Checker Module andnouns identified by User-Feedback Modules.We believe that the more knowledge that thesystem gains and the more nouns that it adds tothe Classified Noun Table the fewer questionshave to be asked.Table 8.
