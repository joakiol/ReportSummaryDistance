j pAbstractWe have proposed a method of ma-chine translation, which acquires trans-lation rules from translation examplesusing inductive learning, and have eval-uated the method.
And we have con-firmed that the method requires manytranslation examples.
To resolve thisproblem, we applied genetic algorithmsto the method.
In this paper, we de-scribe our method with genetic algo-rithms and evaluated it by some experi-ments.
We confirmed that the accuracyrate of translation increased from 52.8%to 61.9% by applying genetic algorithms.1 IntroductionA practical and high quality method of machinetranslation is important for the internationaliza-tion of Japanese society.
Many studies havebeen carried out on machine translation.
Therule-based machine translation (John and Harold,1992) could not deal adequately with various lin-guistic phenomena due to use only limited rules.To resolve this problem, example-based machinetranslations (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Akama andIchikawa, 1979; Stanfill and Waltz, 1986; Sumitaet al, 1993) have recently been proposed.
How-ever, these methods require many translation ex-amples to realize a practical and high qualitytranslation.The goal of our research is to design a com-puter system with the same capability of lan-guage and knowledge acquisition as human beings(Araki and Momouchi, 1994; Araki et al, 1995).In this paper, we propose a method of machinetranslation using inductive learning with geneticalgorithms, The genetic algorithms (Goldberg,1989) imitate tile evolutiona W process which re-peats generational replacenmnt to adapt to the en-vironment.
The purposes are to establish varioushigh quality translation rules from only a smallamount of data, and produce high quality trans-lation results.
The system is expected to contin-uously evolve to higher learning and translationcapability.In this paper, we describe a method of machinetranslation using inductive learning with geneticalgorithms, and show through the results of eval-uation experiments hat genetic algorithms are ef-fective for the example-based machine translation.2 Processes in the New Method2.1 Out l ine  of ti le T rans la t ion  MethodFigure 1 shows the outline of the new translationmethod.
In this paper, we describe the process ofEnglish-Japanese translation as one possible ap-plication of this method.
First, a user inputs asource sentence in English.
Second, in the trans-lation process, the system produces everal candi-dates of translation results using translation rulesextracted in the learning process.
Third, the userproofreads the translated sentences.
Fourth, inthe feedback process, the system determines thefitness value and performs the selection processof translation rules.
In the learning process, newtranslation examples are automatically producedby crossover and mutation, and various transla-tion rules are extracted fl'om the translation ex-amples by inductive learning, A translation exam-pie includes the source sentence and a translated1020Source Sentencelt,l _l :~Learning Proces2s\]/'~\[Figure 1: Outline of the new Inethod of machine translationsentence.
There are two kinds of translation rules:those for sentences and those for words.
The for-mer are called sentence translation rules and thelatter word translation rules.
Rel)etition of theabove mentioned processes corresponds to gener-ational replacement of the whole of system, andthe system continuously evolves to higher qualitytranslation.2.2 Chromosome and geneAs shown in Figure 2, a chromosome correspondsto a translation example which consists of Englishand Japanese sentence, and a gene corresponds toa word.
In this paper, Japanese words are writtenill italics.Translation example--~ ChromosomeA~ \[ I\]~NGLIStI ,JAPANESE(He is Taro.
: Kare wa taroo desu.
)GenesFigure 2: Chromosonm and gene2.3 Feedback ProcessFirst, the system evaluates the translation resultsusing the translated sentences which have beenproofread.
The system adds one to the con-cottranslation fi'equency when the translation resultshave the same character strings as the proofl'eadtranslation results, and adds one to the erroneoustranslation frequency when the translation ruleshave different character strings to the proofreadtranslation results.
Second, the system deter-mines the fitness value of the rules used in transla-tion using these correct and erroneous translationfrequencies.
The fitness value is calculated by tilefitness fimction as follows:t ,tness value(%) =The correct ranslation t'requcncyThe number of uses?
100 (1)Third, tile system performs tile selection pro-cess using the fitness value.
The conditions of theselection process are that the nunlber of uses isover 5 and the fitness value is under 25%.
Thesethresholds were determined by preliminary exper-iment.2.4 Learning ProcessIn this process, new translation examples are alt-tomatically produced by crossover and mutation.In crossover, two translation examples which havecommon parts are selected.
C, rossover l)ositionsare the conHlion parts~ and one-t)oiut crossoversfor these two translation examples are performed.These  one-poillt crossovers use each conll l lOn partof tile English and Japanese sentences.
Figure 3shows examples of crossover.
In Figure 3, "likes"is tile common part in the two English sentences,and "wa" and "ga suki desu" are the COmlnon partsin the two Japanese sentences.
Therefore, "likes"and "wa" are the crossover positions.
One-pointcrossovers are performed, producing two transla-tion examples.
Next, one-point crossovers are per-tbrmed for "likes" and "9a suki desu".
However,the translation examples which are produced havethe same character strings as tile source sentences,and therefore, these translatio, examples are notinputted into tile dictionary.
Translation exam-pies are randomly changed by nmtation, at a rai, eof 2%.
New translatio, examples are also pro-duced by replacing the words of translation ex-amples with those of translation rules.The system extracts the common and differentparts fl'om the character strings of all translationexamples.
These common and different parts areused as translation rules.1021(1)Selection from translation examplesENGLISH JAPANESE(He likes tennis.

This processalso uses genetic algorithm.
The details of thisprocess are as follows:1.
Initial populationThe system selects the translation rules whichcan be applied to the source sentence.
The setof selected translation rules is called the initialpopulation.2.
Determination of fitness valueThe system calculates the fitness value of thetranslation rules by the fitness function (1).3.
Selection processThe method of the selection process was de-scribed in the section on feedback process.4, CrossoverThe method of crossover was described in thesection on learning process.5.
MutationThe method of mutation was described in thesection on learning process.6.
Evaluation of populationThe system substitutes the words in the wordtranslation rules for the variables in the sentencetranslation rules.
A translation rule includes aJapanese sentence or words corresponding to anEnglish sentence or words.
The system producesa Japanese sentence for the English sentence whenthe English sentence has the same character stringas the source sentence.
The Japanese sentencewhich is produced is the translation result, Figure4 shows an example of how the translation resultis produced.The system selects the correct translation re-sult according to two criteria when there are sev-eral candidates of translation results: one criterionis the translation rule which has a higher fitnessvalue and the other is the translation rule whichis more similar to the source sentence.3 Exper iments  fo r  Per fo rmanceEva luat ion3.1 Method of  Eva luat ionThe effective translation results are grouped intotwo categories:(1)The translation result has the same characterstring as the proofread translation result.
(2)The translation result has the same structureas the proofread translation result.This means that the proofread translation re-sult has the same character string as the trans-lation result with substituted nouns or adjectivesfor the variables.The ineffective translation results are groupedinto three categories:(3)The translation result has a different char-acter string than the proofread translation resultwithout unregistered words.
(4)The translation result has a different char-acter string than the proofread translation resultwith unregistered words.
(5)A failed translation.The system ranks ten candidates of translationresults for the user.
The method for determiningoptimal translation results was described in Sub-section 2.5.3.2 Method of  Exper imentsIn the experiments, 1,810 translation exampleswere used as data, of which 1,010 examples weretaken from a textbook (Hasegawa et al, 1991)for first grade junior high school students, and1022'Fable 1: Results of expei'imeuts u ing genetic al-gorithmsRank \ ] - - -R -~ To-TT~~ 47.0% 61.9% Effective translation(3) 14.7%Incffectivc translation (4) 17.1% 38.1%800 examples fl'om another textbook (Ota et al,1991) for first grade junior high school studentsin Japan.
All of these translation examples wereprocessed by the method outlined in Figure 1.First, 1,010 translation examples were used forthe learning process, and 800 translation exanl-ples were used for evaluation of the translation.Experiments were carried out with and withoutgenetic algorithms.
In the experiments withoutgenetic algorithms, crossover, mutation and theselection process were not performed.3.3 Results of ExperimentsThe accuracy rate of translation increased fronl52.8% to 61.9% by applying genetic algorithms.Table 1 shows the results of experiments usinggenetic algorithms.
In this table, (1) ~ (5) cor-respond to (1) ~ (5) in Subsection 3.1.
Table 2shows examples of translation results using geneticalgorithms.3.4 DiscussionIn the experiments without genetic algorithms,high quality translation results coukl not be ob-tained due to the requirement of a very largeamount of translation examples which are simi-lar to other translatiml examples.
Therefore, weapplied genetic algorithms to a method of machinetranslation using inductive learning to automati-cally produce ncw translation examples which aresimilar to other translation examples.
By usinggenetic algorithms, the accuracy rate of transla-tion increased from 52.8% to 61.9%.4 Conc lus ionIn this paper, we proposed a new method of ma-chine translation using inductive learning with ge-netic algorithms.
The results of evaluation exper-iments showed that the accuracy rate of transla-tion increased from 52.8% to 61.9% by using ge-netic algorithms.
Thus, we consider that this newmcthod can get the higher accuracy rate of trans-lation and produce the higher quality translationresults than that of other machine translations.Tahlc 2: Examples of translation results using ge-netic algorithmsInput sentences Translation resultsENGLI811 JAPANESEHe is three years old.
