The ph i l -osophy beh ind  our research  e f fo r t  may be character i zed  asone of seeking general solutions to language descriptionand translation as opposed to one of designing specializedTOSH 2algorithms.
The general principles underlying our researchhave beBn discussed elsewhere) and I shall not dwell on themhere \[4; 5; 6; 8, pp.
3-14; 9\].Three organizational subdivisions of the Centerare the Theoretical Linguistics Group, the Descriptive Lin-guistics Group and the Systems Group.
Activities at theCenter are distributed over these and other specializedare:~s in order to facilitate research.
Results reportedin this paper are presented from the point of view of acti-2 vities in the Descriptive Linguistics Group.The Descriptive Linguistics Group is currentlyengaged in maintaining research data in six languages:Chinese, English, German, Hebrew) Russian and Spanish.We are also maintaining data for independent) non-supportedrescarch in Hindi and Old Saxon.
We have just begun main-taining data for Japanese.
Plans are being made to addFrench to the data in the Linguistics Research System inthe near future.LINGUISTICS RESEARCII SYSTEMThe Linguistics Research System is a hierarchicalsystem of computer programs) which, in addition to programsin the experimental translation system, includes programs de-signed to support a stratified description of language dataTOSH 3(see fo ld -out  ent i t led  LINGUISTICS RESEARCH SYSTE~).

Analysis results in recog-nition of whatever forms have been defined in the lexicalgrammar.
The results are transferred from the analysisprogram in ~ONOLINGUAL RECOGNITION to the LEXICAL ANALYSISprogram in INTERLINGUAL RECOGNITION.
Intermediate displayprograms are ordinarily by-passed in the translation mode.The data then pass to an INPUT TRANSFER tape before enter-ing the TRANSFER program.
This program processed INPUTTRANSFER data against data from the INTERLINGUA tape toproduce an OUTPUT TRANSFER tape.
OUTPUT TRANSFER datapass into the LEXICAL SYNTIIESIS program in INTERLINGUALPRODUCTION to be converted to an acceptable form for in-put to LEXICAL SYNTIIESIS in HONOLINGUAL PRODUCTION.
Theresulting data pass on to the OUTPUT CORPUS tape whichserves as input to the CORPUS DISPLAY program.Output from this lowest level of translationwould be word-for-word, morph-for-morph, etc.
matchingthe order of input forms.
There would be no controlover output morphology or syntax.
We have not consideredit worthwhile to attempt to use model I. translation inde-pendently of model 2.Model 2. translation in the Linguistics ResearchSystem performs in a fashion operationally similar to modeli.
Instead of operating (horizontally on the fold-out)directly through the lexical level, however, we initiateTOSH 5the translation input in LEXICAL ANALYSIS and pass theresulting data (vertically) into SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS.Model 2. translation now continues horizontally on thesyntactic level analogously to the manner described fortile lexical level.Output resulting from the syntactic transla-tion model observes the requirements for well-formednessin output language morphology and syntax.
Examples fromthe January demonstration are given below.
With largevolumes of grammar data, this model is not expected toprovide all the semantic collocational controls which weas linguists will want to maintain.
Nor will it properlyaccount for problems such as pronominal reference.
Theseand other transformational problems will be dealt with ina still higher order of description and programming.
Thesemantic order of programming has only recently beenundertaken.The translation model used in the January demon-stration is essentially a type 2. model, although it con-tains some features proposed for type 5. models.
Analysisis performed on the input language with a context-freephrase structure grammar.
The structures which are thusidentified are transformed into equivalent output languagestructures by the so-called transfer grammar.
Translationoutput is then generated through a context-free phrasestructure grammar o?
the output language \[15\].TOStl 6Rules fo r  use in a s imi la r  model are g iven byI l se  Langerhans \ [3 \ ] .
The essent ia l  d i f fe rence ,  however,between our model and that  proposed by Langerhans isthat  in the la t te r  the input  language is  ana lyzed  in tokerne ls ,  the kerne ls  matched with equ iva lent  output  lan -guage kerne ls ,  and the output  language kerne ls  t rans formedin to  f in i shed  express ions .PREPARATION OF DATAFor the demonst ra t ion ,  we se lec ted  a text  inpsycho logy  to use as a tes t  corpus in German, the inputlanguage (Appendix A).
The corpus consisted of the firstsix paragraphs of an essay appearing in UNIVERSITAS \[I0\].Members of our staff then prepared an English translationto be used as a test corpus in the output language (Appen-dix B).
We use test corpora for verifying the morpho-syntactic description in each language before attemptingto use the grammars in the translation system.
To illus-trate the details of data preparation, I have chosen thesecond sentence from the third paragraph of text (Fig.
I).This sentence was chosen for reasons of simplicity andeconomy of description.
It is typical, however, of trans-formational problems in syntactic translation.
We pro-TOSH 7;~  ?i\ ~ .. ~LD ~\ / g ~~t / ~ ~: .t~ ,,-I/ ?t ~-" IDz ~~TOS~I 8vided a phrase structure description for the sentence,labelling those features of construction which would benecessary for morpho-syntactic (as opposed semantic)grammaticality in German.
The description contains,therefore, more information than is necessary for recog-nition.
But we are designing our grammars, in general,for bi-directional use.
A similar description was pro-vided for the English translation (Fig.
2).After diagramming each sentence, we encodedthe information contained ill the diagrams ill an equiva-lent phrase structure notation \[14\].
The data were thencompiled in the computer system.
As rules are compiledfor each language, each rule is randomly assigned a per-manent identification number.
After the respectivegrammars are compiled and displayed, we refer to themfor the identification of each rule and record the appro-priate number by each occurrence of a rule in the diagram.The diagrams then appear as in Figures 3 and 4.VERIFICATION OF DATATo insure that a description for any given sen-tence is complete, we perform analysis on tlle sentence inthe computer, using the grammar data accumulated up tothat point.

12 f ,  51 -66 \ ] .TRANSLATION OUTPUTAfter all translation data have been collectedand compiled for a given test corpus, the next step is toverify the data in the computer system by attempting tocarry out automatic translation.
As in the case of auto-matic analysis, we expect translation output correspondingat least to the target language structures for which wehave set up translation rules.
That is, we expect in thecase of successful translation an output which resembleswithin satisfactory limits the human translation given asthe ideal goal.
There may be, in addition, various alter-native paraphrases, but the content should be essentiallythe same.
The more likely case in the beginning stages,naturally, is partial success mixed with failure.Our first output for German to English transla-tion is given in Appendix C. The unsatisfactory qualityTOSll 18in this example is the result of a combination of programerrors and inadequate linguistic data.
Word-for-word out-put would produce results quite similar to this sample.Receiving such results, we referred back to the appropri-ate sentence diagrams and lists of translation rules toreconstruct the rules necessary for we11-formed output.A subsequent run with the needed additional translation3 rules is displayed in Appendix D.If we compare the computer translation (AppendixD) with tile human translation (Appendix B), they appearquite similar at first glance, as indeed we should hopethey would be.
A closer inspection, however, revealsnumerous differences.
Some of these result from weak-nesses in description as limited by the model, while someresult from the alternatives implicit in the descriptivedata -- alternatives which the model is designed to copewith.In the first or title paragraph, the Germantitle is constructed in the framework of a prepositionalphrase beginning with ueber.
Since the human translationwas prepared without a preposition, transformation ruleswere set up to delete the preposition accordingly in thecomputer version of the English output.
This is probablynot advisable, however, since in the syntactic model thereTOStl 19is no satisfactory way to distinguish contextually aprepositional phrase functioning as a title from itsother uses.
The implication is, then, that we should re-formulate our transformation for this context to producean English preposition like on.The human and machine translations are identi-cal in the first sentence o?
paragraph I denoted by thenumbers 74 001 in the left margin (Appendices A, B, D).The German adverb allein, which is an element in the rela-tive clause modifying the subject-noun head, has beentransformed into the English adverb only, which now isa member of the corresponding English subject-noun headconstruction and not an element of the following relativeclause.
For the German clause das Problem...so verzwei~t,we have transformed into the corresponding English clausethe problem...so complex, inserting a copula verb i__ss.Finally, in the last clause of the German sentence thereis a passive construction which has been transformed intoan equivalent English active construction.
There aretransformations of similar complexity throughout the re-mainder of the corpus.There is an interesting difference between thelast sentence of the human translation of paragraph I andthe machine translation.
In the human translation thesentence ends ...problem of a dependence of mental pro-cesses on the bed Z.

A l though a l l  the  necessary  grammar ru les  andt rans format ions  were ava i lab le  to  the  t rans la t ion  sys temfor  p roduc ing  an output  ident i ca l  w i th  that  o f  the  humantranslation, it is interesting that the system pickedinstead an alternative paraphrase (and a potential ly con-fusing one) which was more similar to the syntax of theoriginal German input.
The system's choice was made onthe basis of certain probabil ity parameters available toit and with which we are in continual experimentation.It is not surprising that the system selected such analternative, for we expect such to be the case in the pre-sent model.
What is interesting, however, is the factthat a choice was available even within the limited dataset which we prepared for these few paragraphs.
For thisexperiment the system had available to it dictionary datafor the entire article of 52 paragraphs.
With respect tosyntactic data, however, it was quite limited since wesupplied just the rules necessary to carry out analysisand/or synthesis of the six paragraphs involved in theexperiment.
Furthermore, we had limited ourselves in thetransformation data to a choice of one syntactic outputfor each sentence -- the output identical with that ofthe human translation.
Nonetheless, it is evident thatin this small data set there are already sufficientTOSIt 22implicit relationships to permit unplanned for if notunexpected paraphrases.LIMITATIONS IN THE MODELParagraph  2 o f  Appendix D conta ins  probab ly  t i lemost f requent  and character i s t i c  examples  o f  dev ia t ionfrom an idea l  output .
The paragraph  conta ins  a number ofaber rant  p ronomina l  fo rms.

In the  model p resentedhcre ,  we have not ,  fo r  ins tance ,  c lass i f ied  nouns on thebas is  of  such features  as gender ,  an imateness ,  concreteness ,e tc .

For some ins tances  o f  p ronoun-antecedent  agree-ment will remain ambiguous, given two or more antecedents.The ambiguity occasionally cannot be resolved without resortto reference to the extra-linguistic environment.
The firstsentence of paragraph 2 is perhaps a case in point.
Giventhe general context of psychology in which the test corpuswas written, it is conceivable that either the pronoun heor it could refer back to the appropriate respective ante-cedents reader or brain.In those cases where pronoun-antecedent agreementcan be stated within the linguistic environment, we shouldof course be prepared to build such features as gender,animateness, concreteness, countableness, and a host ofother such features into our grammars--features which havebeen difficult to account for systematically before theadvent of stratificational, tagmemic and transformationaltechniques.TOSt.!
24In the  grammars we have under taken  so fa r  fo rthe  severa l  languages ,  we have tended to exc lude  suchfeatures  from morpho-syntact i c  descr ip t ion .EXPANDING THE MODELWe sha l l  inc lude  features  such as lex ica l  co l -l ocat ion  (agent -ac t ion  agreement )  and t rans format ions  ofsemant ic  equ iva lence  in a sys temat ic  descr ip t ion  o f  ah igher  o rder  which presupposes  a morpho-syntact i c  descr ip -t ion  fo r  each language \[8, pp.

67-83\], for which there is as yet no universallyaccepted nomenclature.
The term transformational stronglysuggests itself and is widely used, but the term semantic4 may seem more appropriate to others.TOSH 25PROJECTIONSDuring the coming year  we sha l l  proceed toexpand syntact i c  descr ip t ion  of a l l  languages  now underinvest igat ion .
Su f f i c ient  t rans fer  data w i l l  be com-p i led  between pa i rs  of  languages  to tes t  the genera lva l id i ty  of the model and the genera l  adequacy of thesystem of programs we are now us ing .
Severa l  quest ionssuggest themselves with respect to limitations of themodel, among them: I. how large will the syntacticdescription of a language be in terms of rules beforethe grammar converges on the languages, and 2. in whatways can we improve the quality of translation by usinga more soih\[sticated model, say one in which there isa grammar of structural semantics?
We shall be occupiedprimarily with these two questions in an e~fort to anti-cipate the need for modifying elements of the transla-tion programs and in an effort to test empirically with acomprehensive data base some of the more recent theoriesand notions of linguistics.FOOTNOTESI.TOSH F- 1Research at the L ingu is t i cs  Research Center  i s  supportedby the Nat iona l  Sc ience Foundat ion)  the U.

In=tensive preparation of test data for the demonstra-tion covered the period from August) 1964 to January)1965.
General research and development of programshave been under way since May) 19S9.3.
On comparing the computer and human versions of theEnglish translation with the German version, thereader is reminded that nowhere are any corpus datastored explicitly in the translation system of programs.Only raw corpus data in the source language are fed inas input to the analysis programs in the system.
Theanalysis and synthesis programs use grammatical des-criptions in both languages with attendant transfor-mation/translation rules to produce output in thetarget language from the analysis-transfer-synthesiscycle.4.
Perhaps a passing observation is in order.
The termtransformational) borrowed from mathematics) is aterm generally applicable to any process of mappingequivalences of one structure onto another and sois applicable to all levels of linguistic description.FOOTNOTES (CONTINUED)TOSII F- 2I t  shou ld  uot~ there fore  t be used  to  denote  a par t i cu la rleve l  in  a h ie rarch ica l  s t ruc ture .
