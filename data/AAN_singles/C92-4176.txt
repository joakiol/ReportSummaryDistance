INTRODUCTIONIn another study (Weiner and De Pahna199,31, we determined that accessibilityhierarchies among the meanings of po\]ysemouswords play an ilnportant role in the generationand comprehension of a category of sinlpleriddles, In that paper and this one we restrictour attention to riddles that fit this definition:d :/d(//e cons/Ms ol:a se)~/e se/e/enee <lues/ean\[/FQJ /o/lowed by a s///g/: se/s/e/see aesswe/" ill/A/.//)e //Q flrese/e/s ~7 col/eel/by/o/a///':3u/e,s'wh/bl/ c'a:) apply to///ore/hal/o:/e AlP, /hu, ra//o#:/?/S :no/'e /he// one an.type/"/o/lye </uesl/m:.a/eddie an, re:el" \[#d) a/:d a .qm:~kl e/ns/v:.,::/~e R~ //a,r bee:/eo/e.s'D"ueled :~ suc/: o way u,r1o lead/lie/'/rid/re/opre~'z"/he .5't/reghtanswe:" over ttJe tIA.Lexical ambiguity is at the center of riddles ofthis type.
Consider this riddle:(1) RQ: What has a mouth and eamlot eat?RAp A river.Here the riddler intends by I i l~h the inanimatemeaning but the sentence is constructed so thatthe anilnate one is the more natural reading, tnour 1993 paper, we showed how the existence ofaeeessibililty hierarchies could account for thispreference.We now turn our attention to the need tobuild this mechanism into any knowledgerepresentation language that hopes to capturethe full subtlety of natural anguage since it isour contention that riddles, violate the rules ofnormal discourse and thus represent a usefulway % approach the study of these rules.
Tothat end, we present aknowledge representationplan along wit.h an algorithm that uses therepl'esentatiou in order to generate riddles.Althou~g~ the representational structures that weuse are in the style of lKl, ONE (Braehman andSehlnolze), this is purely a convenience.Accessibility hierarci)ies must be built into ~lysystem which can process natural anguage aswell as one which can play the riddling game.2.
ACC\]U',SSIBIIJTY IIII'~RAR(Jlt\[I:,SCognitive psychologists have long recognizedthat people form taxonomic eaLegories (l{oseb1978) wilt) smnc members heiul; more typicalinstances of those categories than others.
Thisgraded structure is not limited to taxonomiccategories btR seems to include such .tmlikelypossibilities as formal categories like thecategory of odd numbers a\]ld that of sq!Jares(Armstrong, Gleitman, and GMtman 19831 andlinguistic categories for phones, phonemes andsyntactic structures (Lakoff 1986).
In recentyears, researchers have shown that categoriesarc not structurally invarianL but are, in fact,demonstrably unstable (l/arsalou 1987).
Theirgraded structure varies with >leh factors aslinguistic context and point of view and evendiffers for the same individual over time.The formation of ad hoe categories toaccomplish specific /*oals (Harsalou 19fl3) isanother area of instability irl human categoryformation, l"or example, the category"things to- take-out -of -a  burning /louse"might include subordinate categories like1The order of the names of the two authors is arbitrary.

and "portabletv's" (Murphy and Medin 1985) and is formedonly when one's house is burning or during adiscussion like this one.
Ad hoe categories, onceformed, function similarly to more traditionalcategories, As we show later in this paper, adhoe category formation is an importantcomponent in the generation or solution ofriddles,A model that is to account for thehuman tendency to form categories mustaccount for both the stable and the unstableaspects.
Barsalou's approach to the instabilityin categories is to recognize the existence ofboth  context - independent  andcontext-dependent i formation m long-termmemory, where it is arranged as interrelated,continuous knowledge.
It is thecontext-independent information that is mostlikely to be shared by a large number ofindividuals within a speeeh community.
Itsactivation is obligatory, When one thinks ofr_cbilla, for example, "red-breasted" springs tomind whereas "poisonous" is triggered byrattlesnakes.
Context dependent information, bycontrast, is aeeessed only within a relevantcontext So "hard" may be triggered by ice whilediseussing/all.
The instability of categories iaccounted for by different information for agiven category being compiled in workingmemory at different times depending on thesituation.
Some information, e.g., eontext-independent i formation, is more aceessible thanother information,We have extended this model (Weiner andDe Palma 1993) to explain the tendency ofpeople to think of the mouth of a person beforemouth of a river in (1) above, Given thepresumed universality of certain principlesgoverning eategorization, it seems likely that, incontext neutral situations sueh as (1),ambiguous words form ad hoe category-likestructures oftheir multiple meanings onto whichan aecessibility hierarchy is imposed.
Forexample, in (1), there is a category-likestructure corresponding to the phonemicrealization of the word mo_ulk to whieh thedifferent meanings belong; ill (1), one thinks ofthe mouth of a person before tile mouth of ariver.3.
THE KNOW~DGE BASEWe thus offer our exposition of the structurethat underlies the kind of lexieal ambiguityfound in riddles as linguistic evidence for theepisteinologieal requirements of a knowledgerepresentation system whieh can support bothnormal discourse and riddles.
Riddles will usethe knowledge in one way: normal discourse willuse it ill another.
The representation willremain the same; only the algorithms will differ.Consider Figure 1, a knowledge-basefragment in the style of KL-ONE that containsthe information necessary to generate or solveriddle (1).
The KL-ONE entities most relevant tothis discussion are Concepts (diagrammatieallyrepresented by ellipses) and RoleSets(represented byencircled squares).
The Conceptis the primary representational entity.
For us,it represents he category of objects indicated bythe Concept name, Thus, in Figure 1, Conceptsstand for the category RIVER-MOUTH, thecategory ANIMATE_MOUTlt, and so on.
Conceptsare connected to one another by superC links,represented in tile figures by double arrows, AsuperC link indicates that tile subordinateConcept (subConeept) stands in an inheritanceand subsumption relationship with thesuperordinate Concept (superConeept).
(Thehigher Concept subsumes the lower ojae; thelower one inherits from the higher one).
Thus,PERSON_MOUTH is an ANIMATLMOUTH and aMOUTH,In our knowledge base, RoleSets represent,predicates of a Concept, the fi!\]ers of which,known as Value Restrictions (v/r's}, arethemselves Concepts.
So PERSON-MOUTH has aRoleSet "funetion" with the filler EAT, meaningill our representation that a function of aperson's mouth is to eat, {Of course there areothers not shown here).f'urther, each RoleSet filler has a numberrestriction represented by two numbers withinparentheses.
These represent he lower andupper bounds on the number of fillers for aAcrEs DE COTING-92, NA~,  23-28 AO~'T 1992 I 1 2 2 Pnoc.

Thissymbol is not part of the KL-ONE language.
Weare introdueing it here as a new primitive,l.edfical, which contains lexieal information abouta Concept, For our purposes, Lexieal containsthe phonemic representation of a Concept(although, for simplieity in this figure, onlycertain phonemic representations are aetuallyprovided).
This arrangement allows us toacknowledge the relationship between aConceptand the word used to name the Concept withoutasserting that they are the same thing,separating meanings of polysemous words fromtheir phonemic representation,As discussed above, ambiguous(polysemous, homophonous) words can form adhoe eategory-like structures of their multiplemeanings.
Thus, we can have a superConeeptMOUTH, a category of polysemous words, withsubConeepts  ANIMATE_MOUTH andINANIMATE_MOUTH.
We reeognize the probabilitythat in the ease of ambiguous forms with achoice of animate vs, inanimate meaning, theanimate one is thought of before the inanimateone (Weiner and De Palma 1993), So the ideaseneoded in Figure 1, although not explicitlyspelled out with respect to aeeessibility, arebased on the assumption that, incontext-independent situations, people tend tothink of animate things before they think ofinanimate ones.In riddle (2),(2) RQ: What has four legs and only one foot?RA: A bed.we model the riddling process by assuming thatthe phrase Lo~ ke4~ causes the formation of anad hoe eategory "four legged thing."
Arepresentation of a portion of the knowledgeneeded to generate or solve riddle (2) will begiven in a future paper.4.
THE ALGORITHMThe following algorithm refers to Vqgure 1and will generate riddle (1).
The algorithmrequires three functions:1, I"indI-loms(HC1,HC2,C1,C2) - searches theknowledge base for two homophonous Coneepts,HC1 and HC2 where HCl and HC2 are the valuerestrictions of two Coneepts' RoleSets.
Call theseConcepts Cl and C2.
CI must eontain the moreaccessible (i.e.
in these examples,eontext-independent, animate) eoneept.
Forexample, after an application ofFindHoms(llCl,HC2,C1,C2), on the KB fragmentcontained in Figure 1, the variables would looklike this:HCI <---PERSON_MOUTHCI < --- PERSONHC2 < .
.
.
.
RIVER_MOUTHC2 <- - -  RIVERNote that HCI contains PERSON_MOUTH, a valuerestriction of C1 (PERSON), tIC2 containsRIVER_MOUTH, a value restrietionof C2 (RIVER) and the Concept in C1 (PERSON) isa more accessible Coneept han tile one in C2(RIVER).2.
Lex(A,B) -.
returns in B the word by which aConcept, A, is known.
Remember that thephonemic representation of this word iscontained in "Lexieal" (represented in the figureby tile diamond shape) for each eoneept.
Forexample, Lex(RIVER_-MOUTH,H) returns/mawO'/in13,:3, MisMateh(CI,C2,HC1,HC2,Type,RSVR) - examinesthe knowledge base (KB) for a mismateh of thefollowing type:HCI has a RoleSet value restrietion (RSVR)that He2 does have.
hi Figure 1, this RSVR forHC1 would be EAT.
Mismatch returns this inRSVR.
Thus, using Figure 1, Mismatch wouldreturn EAT in RSVR.
Note that HC1 is moreaeeessible than HC2 by virtue of being animate.The algorithm, then, looks like this:Acrlm DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Aou'r 1992 1 1 2 4 PROC.

";End.It should be noted that, in the interest ofsimplicity, we have eonflated tile issues involvedill generating or solving riddles.
Once you knowthe heuristic with which riddles of tile typeconsidered in this paper are constructed andhave created a KB of Concepts, generation is asimple matte,'.
Solution, of course, is theinverse of this algorithm5.
CONCLUSIONSOur examples in this paper use KL-ONE as aconvenient model of a knowledge r presentationsystem.
We propose the addition of accessibilityas all important epistemological primitive to theKL-ONE system since it appears critical to buildthis factor into any knowledge base which canboth support a system for natural languageprocessing and be used for certain kinds ofhumor.
Our work also highlights otherrequirements for knowledge representationsystems capable of supporting natural language:1.
