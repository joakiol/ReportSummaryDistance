TOWARD A PAP~I'NG METHOD FOR FREE WORD O ~  LANGUAGES xJanusz S. Hte~, StantsZaw SzpakowiozIns t i tu te  of  In fo rmat ics ,  Warsaw Un ivers i tyP.0.H.
1210, 00-901Warezawa, Poland,,Free word order" is a traditional term that should notbe taken literally.
However, we shall retain the term for itsconciseness.Formal descr ip t ions  o f  =yntax have been usua l ly  basede i ther  on the immediate const i tuents  or  on the  dependencyp~ilosophy.
Neither of them seems directly applicable to freeword order languages.
The intertwining phrases cannot be de-scribed naturally by IC rules.
Some coordinate constructionsare difficult to describe by me~us of dependency relations.In  our op in ion ,  parsers  fo r  f ree  word order  languages shouldnot  be based on the methods developed w i th in  the IC framework.Scarce exper iments  wi th  parsers  based on the dependency form-a l i sm,  eg.
/5 / ,  do not  seem promis ing.
There fore ,  we dec idedto take  a f resh  s ta r t  and to  a t tack  the problem by reana lys -ing  the bas ic  not ions  of  syntax and pars ing .
We focus oura t tent ion  on those formal  aspects  of  a language system whichmight be most use fu l  fo r  automat ic  text  p rocess ing .

The Notion of S.~t_ax.In  th i s  paper,  we understand syntax as the domain offorr~al re la t ions  between words, i .e .
roughly  as so -ca l ledsur face  syntax.
We def ine  the not ion  us in~ a morphology-basedc r i te r ion ,  descr ibed  below.The outcome of morphological  ana lys i s  can be ambiguousfo r  an i so la ted  word.
In  most s i tuat ions ,  however, the  morpho-log ica l  features  of a word are un ique ly  determined by somefo rmal  proper t ies  of i t s  context .Sometimes the ambigui ty  remains ,  as in  the fo l low ingsent  enc eOp~nien ie  bryg~d piecowyoh spowodowa~o potgp ien ie  wuJa Jana.1 I I !

~nom./ac?.There are f i ve  independent  ambigu i t ies  in  th i s  sentence ,y ie ld ing  32 coherent  read ings .
Two of them are due to Sheneut ra l i za t ion  of agent /pat ient  funct ion  dur ing  nomina l i sa t~ion .
For example, "potgp ien ie  x" means "d isapprova l  of ~ '(e i ther  "x d isapproves y" or "y d isapproves  x" ) i  such anambigu i ty  can be reso lved  only  by exsmining the meav.ing of ag iven phrase,  so we ca l l  i t  semantic one.The next ambiguity Occurs in the phrase "wuJa Jana",that means either "uncle John"gen ?
or "John's uncle"gen.OHere we can see two kinds of syntactic relations: case agreem-ent (the former interpretation) or government (the latterone), which both require "Jana" to be in genitive case.
Suchan ambi~ulty we consider as purely syntactic one.In the phrase "bry~d plecowych" we call discern eithercase agreement ("piecowych"gen" is then an adjective) orgovernment ("piecowych"gen ?
is then a noun).
Here, the elim-ination of morphologica l  homon~my g ives  r i se  to a l te rnat iveconst ruct ions ,  thus inc reas ing  the syntact i c  ambi~i ty ,-38 -The last ambiguity stems from the nominative/accusatlveneutralization both of a virtual subject and a virtual objectof the sentence.
It suffices to assign a syntactic functionto one of them~ the function of the other and the morpho-logical characteristics of both of them will be fully determ-ined.The example demonstrates how certain relations betweensentence components allow to disambiguate the morphologicalproperties of individual words without resorting %0 theirmeanings.
In our approach, these relations constitute thelevel of syntax /3/.Syntactic relations (eg.
agreement, government) consistin matching syntactic properties (eg.
case, gender) of re-speotiveu units.
The basic unit is a morphological word /2/.By the syntactic structure of a sentence we understandsome explicit representation of all the syntactic relationsbetween its components, usually - a graph.
Such a graph neednot necessarily be connected.
For example, some modifiers arelinked to their heads only by semantic relations and not bysyntactic ones.
Similarly, some elllptio sentences may havedisconnected syntactic representationu.We ~ulderstand parsing as a process of establishing allsyntact i c  s t ruc tures  of  a g iven  text .
A l though such s t ructur -es a re  ra ther  unsoph is t i ca ted ,  they  are  pract i ca l ly  veryimportant for low-level text processi~.In search of an adequate parsing method, we found theidea of ~arcus /4/ most appealing.
He claims that naturallanguages are designed to be deterministically parsed fromleft to right and that writing a grammar should consist infinding out local clues which enable the parser to selectproperly what to do next.
This idea seems even more advantag-eous for free word order languages.
Rich inflection makes- 39  -the  loca l  c lues  much more exp l i c i t  and the pareer ' s  expectat -ions  more prec i se .
