A Log ic -Based Government -B ind ing  Parser  for Mandar in  Chinesettsin-Hsi CHENDepartment of Computer Science and Information EngineeringNational Taiwan UniversityTaipei, Taiwan 10764, R.O.C.NTUTO46@TWNMO El O.BITN ETAbstractMandarin Chinese is a highly flexible and context-sensitivelanguage.
It is difficult to do the case marking and indexassignment during the parsing of Chinese sentences.
Thispaper proposes a logic-based Government-Binding approach totreat this problem.
The grammar formalism is specified in aformal way.
Uniform treatments of movements, arbitrarynumber of movement non-terminals, automatic detection ofgrammar errors beforehand, and clear declarative semantics areits specific features.
Many common linguistic phenomena ofChinese sentences are represented with this fornmlism.
Forexample, topic-comment structures, the ba-constructions, thebei-constructions, relative clause constructions, appositiveclause constructions, and serial verb constructions.
A simplepronot,n resolution is touched upon.
The expressivecapabilities and the design methodologies show this mechanismis also suitable for other flexible and context-sensitivelanguages.1.
IntroductionChinese is a highly flexible language, The same meaningmay be represented in many different Chinese patterns.
Inother words, Chinese provides many ways for the nativespeakers to express their feelings.
For example, a sentence like"I have told Mr. Lee that they want these books" in English, wecan form multiple different patterns in Chinese:(a) ~ ~ i~ ~ \[np ~Zl  Is ~f~\] ~ ~-~ ~1?I have told \[np Mr. Lee\] \[s that they want these books\].
(b) \ [np - :~ li,~J~ ~-~ ~ ti \[s t~  ~ ~ {~\]o\[tap Mr. Leeli, I have told t i \[s that they want these books\].
(c) ~ ~}=~ \[np ~qg~\ ]  \[s \[np ~ ~ :~ \]j {I.~ \] ~ tj\] 0I have told \[tap Mr. Lee\] \[s that \[np these books\]j they wanttj\].
(d) \[np i~ l i ,  ~ ~ ~ ti Is \[tap ~ ~ ~\ ] j  4~\ ]  ~ tj\]o\[np Mr. Lee\] i, I have told t i \[s that \[np these books\]j theywant tj\].
(e) \[rip ~:?
i~ \]i, \[tap i~-~-~ \] j ,  ~ ~ i~ t i \[s {~t  ~ tj\]o\[tap Mr. Lee\] i, \[np these books\]j, I have told t i Is that theywant tj\].In reality, it shows the specific pattern: topic-comment structurein Mandarin Chinese.
Topicalization may be deemed one of themovement transformations.
Examples (b) and (c) specify anobject is moved to the topic position.
Examples (d) and (e) aresentences with multiple topics.
We can realize that the morepredicates a sentence includes, the more topic positions it has.And thus, the more complicated patterns may be generated.
Itis good for the language users, however, it is difficult toprocess this type of languages in computer.Chinese is also a highly context-sensitive hmguage.
Thereare so many phenomena, e.g.
index assigmnent, case marking,etc., depending on the context information even within aChinese sentence.
The index assignments in the topic-commentpatterns hown above explain this point.
Examples (d) attd (e)are legal interpretations.
However, their bindings are different.The former is a serial binding, and the latter is a crossedbinding.
Serial binding is qot always true.
For example, theindex assignment cannot be* Inp-Z'~-~Ji\]t=L=li , \[np Lff.
a:- ~~l j ,  ~\[J~ -~d~ i ,.
'~ tj Is ~:~ti\]o* \[np Mr. Lee\] i, \[tap these books\]j, I have told tj \[s thatthey want ti\].This is because the object that someone told must be ananimate.
Therefore, the index assignment, which is anecess,'uy step toward correct interpretation of natural anguagesentences, is difficult in computer.This paper proposes a Government-Binding approach todeal with these highly flexible and context-sensitive languagessuch as Mandarin Chinese.
It is organized as follows.
Section2 specifies the concepts of Government-Binding Theory.Section 3 gives a fortnal definition of Government-Bindingbased logic grammars.
Section 4 demonstrates a Chineseparser from several context-sensitive constructions, andtouches on the simple pronoun resolution within a Chinesesentence.
Section 5 concludes the remarks.2.
Government-Binding TheoryGovernment-Binding (GB) Theory/Chomsky 1981, Sells1985/is the descendant ofTransformation Grammars/Radford1981/.
Its simplified organization is shown in Figure 1.
Move- c~ , which is a general operation, moves anything anywherebetween d-structure and s-structure, and between s-structureand logical foma.
GB Theory includes a series of modules thatcontain constraints and principles which govern the movementtransformation.The Projection Principle preserves the syntactic informationand the semantic information at each level (d-structure,s-structure, and logical form) during the movementtransformation.
Trace Theory postulates that there exist variousempty categories at various levels of mental representation.48 11.
Projection Principled-structure s-structure - logical form2.
Empty Category 3.
Binding TheoryFil;ure 1.
Government-Binding TheoryThus, we must have the capabilities to verify the relationshipbetween the moved constituent and the empty constituent.
GBTheory provides everal mechanisms for the verification.
TheEmpty Category Principle (ECP) says "A trace must beproperly governed."
That is, we must find some cx thatc-commands the trace /3 .
And cx binds /3 iff (a) c,c-commands/3 , and (b) a and /3 are co-indexed.
Theirdefinitions are based on C-Command Condition.
TheC-Command Condition states the following:a c-eomman&/3 if and only if the first branchit,g ~,odedominating et alo dominates /3, and ct does not itselJdominate t3.It states a co-reference r lation between a moved element and itsmtce.
The Subjaeency Condition is given in the following:Any application of Move - e~ may not cross more than onebounding node.\[t specifies island consuaints on the moved constituents.The Binding Theory/Sells 1985/shownbelow is used forsimple pronoun resolution:(Principle A) An anaphor is bound in its Governing Category.
(Principle B) A pronominal is free in its Governing Category.
(Principle C) An R-expression is free.Anaphors include reflexive and reciprocals, pronominalsinclude pronouns, and R-expressions include all other nounphrases.3.
A Government -B ind ing  Based Logic GrammarFormal i smThe formal definition of Government-Binding based LogicGrammars (GBLGs) is specified incremental ly in thefollowing.Definition 1.
A Government-Binding based Logic Grammaris a 6-tuple GBLG = (T,2,B,S,C,R) where:(1) T is the set of lexical terminals.
Each lexical terminalis denoted by an atomic formula with lexical category as itspredicate symbol.
(2) ,'~ is the set of non-terminals.
Y = ZI' U ~\]v k) \]~Mk) ~G where:(a) Zp is the set of phrasal non-terminals.
Each phrasalnon-terminal is represented by an atomic formula with phrasalcategory as its predicate symbol.(b)Y.
V is the set of virtual non-terminals.
Each virtualnon-terminal is specified by an atomic formula.(c)Y.
M is the set of movement non-terminals.
Amovement :non-terminal is one of the following two forms:A<<<BorB>>>AwhereAETk)  ~pt9  ~v,andB E ~V" \]~-7'LM and ~RM denote the set of non-terminals A<<< B and the set of non-terminals B >>> A, respectively.
(d)~ G is the set of goals.
Each goal is denoted by aliteral.
(3) B C ~p is the set of bounding non-terminals.
Abotmding non-terminal is a phrasal non-terminal with boundingnode as its predicate symbol.
(,4) S E ~p is the start non-terminal.
(5) C is the set of logic connectives 'and' and 'or' that aredenoted by ',' and ';' respectively.
A grammar element isdefined rccursivcly in terms of logic connectives as follows:(a) A lexical tm'minal L E T is a grammar element.
(b)A phrasal non-terminal P E ~p is a grammar element.
(c) A virtual non-terminal V E .~v is a grammar element.
(d)A movement non-terminal M ~ ~M is a grammarelement.
(e)A goat E ~JG is a grammm" element.
(f) If A and B are grammar elements, then (A,B) and(A;B) are g,ammar elements.The first five types are called basic grammar elements, and thelast one is a compound grammar element.
Let G t and G E be theset of basic granmaar elements and the set of compoundgrammar elements, respectively.
(6) R is the set of production rules.
A production rule isof the following form:X 0 ?-> X l C l X 2 C 2 ... C(m.l) Xmwhere X 0 < ~l,,X i E G E for 1 _< i _< m, andC i g2 C for I ?
i _< (m-1).It is obvious each production rule can be translated into asequence of production rules with the logical operator 'and'only.An example written with this formalism is shown asfollows.
It captures the relative clauses in English like "Theman who he met is a teacher.
"(rl) s - ->np,  vp.
(r2) np --> pronoun.
(r3) np --> det, notm.
(r4) np- -> det, noun, rel.
(r5) vp -.-> tv, np.
(r6) vp --> tv, trace.
(rT) vp --> iv.
(r8) rel --> tel pronoun <<< trace, s.where T = {pronoun, det, noun, tv, iv, rel pronoun},?p = {s, np, vp, rel},?v  = {trace },~m = {rel_pronot, n <<< trace}, andB = {s, np}.The rule (r8) describes a constituent in phrase structure s isextraposed to the rel pronoun position.
Which constituent maybe moved from which position is specified by rule (r6).Definit ion 2.
\]\[:or X E ~p, Y E ~v  and TR is a transitiverelation, X TR Y if(1) X is tile rule head of a production rule, and Y is agrammar clement in its ntle body, or(2) X is tile rule head of a production rule, 1 {- Y.p is agrammar element in its rule body, and I TR Y, or(3) there exist 11, 12 ..... and I n E ~,p, such that X TR I t2 49TR 12 TR ... TR I n TRY.The transitive relation TR is also a dominate relation.
Thisis because TR is a dominate relation between a phrasalnon-temfinal nd a virtual non-terminal.Definition 3.
A production rule X 0 --> X 1, X 2 .. .
.
.
X m(where X i E G I for I < i < m) is significant if it satisfies theextra restrictions:(1) for any grammar element X i = (A <<< B) E \]~LM,there must exist some Xj, i < j  -< m, such that (Xj, B) E TR.
(2) for any grammar element X i = (B >>> A) E ~RM'there must exist some Xj, 1 _<j < i, such that (Xj, B) E TR.A logic grammar GBLG is significant if each productionrule E R is significant.
The above sample grammar issignificant for the following reasons:(1) The rules (rl) - (r7) are significant trivially.
(2) The ruletel --> rel pronoun <<< trace, sis significant because there exists a transitive relation TR 1 suchthat s TR 1 vp TR l trace.Proposition 1.
The c-command condition is embeddedimplicitly in GBLGs if these grammars are significant.P roo f .
For a significant production rule:X 0 --> X l, X 2 ..... X mif X i = (A <<< B) E ~LM then there must exist some Xj (i < j< m), such that Xj dominates the virtual non-terminal B in theother production rule.
The phrasal non-terminal X 0 is the firstbranching node that dominates A and Xj, and thus alsodominates B.
Therefore, A c-commands B. X i = (B >>> A) E~RM has the similar behavior.This property can be used to check the con'ectness ofgranmwas automatically before parsing.Definition 4.
The transitive relation TRsubjacency is a subsetof TR and satisfies the restrictions: for X E ~p, Y E Y~V, XTRsubjacency Y if X TR I l TR 12 TR ... TR I n TR Y, and theredoes not exist more than one Ij such that lj E B.Proposit ion 2.
A significant logic grammar is a restrictivecontext sensitive grammar.
This is because the truth value of amovement non-terminal depends on the appearance of a virtualnon-temainal preceding or following it./Chen 1988/ proposes a bottom-up arsing system forGBLGs.
Figure 2 shows the execution of our sample grammarfor the sentence "The man who he met is a teacher".
The labelon the are indicates the step number during parsing.
The emptyconstituent trace is generated in phrase vp, then passed tophrase s, and finally cut in phrase rel.
Comp,'tred with otherlogic programming approaches/Matsumoto 1983, McCord1987, Pereira 1981, Stabler 1987/, especially RLGs/Stabler1987/, GBLGs have the following features:(1) the uniform treatments of leftward movement and therightward movement,(2) the arbitrary number of movement non-terminals inthedetman who2 3w wnoun rel_gronouncut  t race10~npJhe met trace4~ 6~pronoun tvnp vp(trace).\x~8s(trace) ,,',"tel .\~, ,..,'I ~cet6,~Sis a teachertv det nounnp.

Sample Parsingthe rule body,(3) automatic detection of grammar errors befi)re parsing.The former two features are useful to express the highlyflexible languages like Chinese.4.
A Chinese Parser4.1 Topic-comment StructuresTopic-comment s ructure is one of the specific features inMandarin Chinese.
There are several interesting linguisticphenomena concerning these structures:(1) Topic may be moved from the argument positions inthe comment - as subject, direct object, or indirect object.
(2) Many categories may appear in the topic position, e.g.n", s', v", or p".
(3) There may be multiple topics in a sentence.
(4) The comment may not contain a constituent which isanaphorically related to the element in the topic.Under the above observations, topic may be represented as:topic(topic(N2bar),n2bar,Semanfic,Index,Case) -->n2bar(N2bar,Semantic,Index,Case,Classifier).The second argument of predicate topic specifies the phrasalcategory of the topic, i.e., n2bar  in this example.
It isimportant for tile parser to decide whether the constituent mayco-index with a trace.Next, the production rules for generating sentences areshown as follows:s 1 bar(s 1 bar(Topic 1,Topic2,S)) -->topic (Topic 1 ,Cat 1 ,S 1,I 1 ,Case 1)<<< trace(topic,info(Cat 1,S1,I1,Case 1)),topic(Topic2,Cat2,S 2,I2,Case2)<<< trace(topic,info(Cat2,S2,I2,Case2)),s(S).s 1 bar(s 1 bar(Topic,S)) -->topic(Topic,Cat,S,I,Case)<<< trace(topic,info(Cat,S,I,Case)),s(S).slbar(slbar(S)) --> s(S).50 3()1' these three production rules, the first two define the"topie-comnrent" pattern, and the last one is a rule withouttopic.Finally, the phrasal non-terminal s is introduced.s(s(N2bar,V2bar)) -->n2bar(N2bar,Semantic,lndex,Case,Classifier),v2bar(V2bar,Semantic,lndex,Case,subj,nonbei).s(s(t(Case,lndex),V2bar)) -->mtce(X ,in fo(n2bar,Semantic,lndex,Case)),v2bar(V2bt~r,Semantic,lndex,Case,subj,nonbei).s(s(N2bar,V2bar)) --.>n2bar(N2bar,S,I,C,Classifier)<<< tracc(bei,info(n2bar,S,l,C)),v2bar(V2bar,S 1,11 ,C 1 ,subj,bei).s(s(t(C,l),V2bar)) -->trace(lelative,info(n2bar, S,I,C))<<< Irace(bmj ~lo(n2bm,S,,,C)),v2bar(V2bar,S 1,11,C 1,subj,bei).s(s(V2bar)) --> v2b u(V2bar, .

Only associative phrase,relative clause, and appositive clause atre listed in the tbllowing.Associative phrase denotes two noun phrases are linked by aspecial Chinese word tie ('f19 ').
For example,~-t ~ ~d ~J .X.
V\] (the population of China).
'I he rulen2bar(n2bar(A,N2bar),Semantic,Index,Case,Classifier)-->asc(A),n2bar(N2bar,Semantic,Index,Case,Chtssifier)represents this constnmtion.
The definition of associativeclause is:asc(asc(N2bar,De)) -->n2bar(N2bar,Semantic,Index,Case,Classifier),* de(De).Both relative clause and appositive clause are nominalization ithe form: nominalization + head noun, and are defined asfollows:ret(rel(S,De)) --> s(S), * de(De).app(app(S,De)) -.> s(S), * de(De).ttowever, they are different in the restricting the reference oftire head noun.
The head noun that a rehttive chmse modifiesrefers to some unspecified participant in the nominalizationpart.
l:or example,(the former i who t i grows fluits), ',rod4lt~\]'tJ N t i \[l',J :/k-~?
i(the fluits i that they grow ti).The head uoun 'Zk-~ - ' (tire fruits) refers to an empty constituent(either subjcct or object) in the relative clause.
This type ofconstructions can be considered a rightward movement.
Forappositive clause and head noun pair, tile head noun does notrefer to any entity in the modifying clause, i.e., appositiveclause, t;or example,;fJ~ {l'g ~It N::e: fl',J N(the matter concerning our renting a house).The nominalization ,~.~ ?lj ;fll .~-~'  (our renting it house) servesas a complement to the head noun -:~' (the matter).
This typeof constrllctiorrs cannot be regarded as a 111ovcrllerlttransformation.
Two rules are specitied for them:n2bar(n2bar(Re\],N2bar),S,I,C,Classifier) -..>rel(Rel),trace(relative, in tb(n2bar,S,I,C 1 ))>>> n2bar(N2bar,S,I,C,Classifier).n2bar(n2bar(Atlp,N2bar),S,I,C,Classifier) -->app(App),n2bar(N2bar,S,I,C,Classifier).The only difference between these two rules is a trace has to befound i"n rehltive clause.
Note the cases of the emptyconstituent and the overt constituent may be different in relativeclause + head noun cot}strut/ion.
For tire sake of space, thenlbar is neglected in this paper.4 .3  Verb PhraseDifferent from a noun phrase, a verb phrase may havepre-modifiers and post-modifiers.
The preverbal specifiers areha-phrases, bei-phrases, adverbial phrases, degree phrases,preposition phrases, quantifier phrases, aspect, and modal.The postverbal modifiers are semential constructions, adverbialphrases, quantifier phzascs, classifier phrases, prepositionalph,ases, and aspect.
Only Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs)are abom to discuss in detail.
The rulev2bar(v2bar(Va 1 bar, V b 1 bar),S,I,\[C l,C2\],subj) -->v 1 bar(Va 1 bar,S,I,C 1 ,sub j),vl bar(Vb 1 bar,S,I,C2,su b j)means two separate vents juxtaposed together, e.g.
~'J~ iv'-~ \ ]  Iv' i~2-2J~\] (I Iv' bought a ticket\] and iv' went inD.
It isone of the SVCs.
The two events have tile identical subject,but cases may be different.
The other groups of SVCs are:(1) One verb phrase or clause serving as the direct objectof another verb, e.g.~ ~ ~2, ~1~ o (I want to go to school.
)~J~ ~I~ ,(\[~ 5~ -~\]~ o (I want him to go to school.
)(2) Pivotal constructions, e.g.4 51(I entrust him to take care of an affair.
)(3) Descriptive clauses, e.g.
(She cooked a dish that I very much enjoyed eating.
)Only the former two are considered.
Tile verbs with first useare classified into t2 attd t3, attd the verbs with the second use,i.e., pivotal construction, are classified into t8.
It is not easy todefine descriptive clauses with a rule or a new category, e.g.POSSESSIVE/Yang 1987/.
This is because tile descriptiveclause is optional.
Without this clause, the original sentence isacceptable too.
Furthermore, many verbs may be used with thedescriptive clauses.The lowest level vlbar (v') touches on the uses of thesubcategorization frames of the specified verb.
According tothe frames and ECP, a virtual non-terminal trace is placedwherever it is needed.
For example,v 1 bar(v 1 bar(T l,N2bar),Semantic,Index,Case,HasSubj)-->* t 1 (T l,HasSubj:Semantic:Case,Semantic 1 :Casel),n2bar(N2bar,Semantic l, lndex l,Casel,Classifier).v 1 bar(v 1 bar(T1 ,t(Case 1,I ndex 1 )), Semantic,Index ,Case,tIasSubj) -->* tl(T1,HasSubj:Semantic:Case,Semanticl :Casel),trace(X,in fo(n2bar,Semantic 1 ,Indexl,Casel)).v 1 bar(v 1 bar(T2,pseudoS (e(Case 1,Index),V2bar)),Semantic,lndex,Case,subj) -->* t2(T2,subj :Semantic:Case),v2bar(V2bar,Semantic,l ndex,Case 1,sub j).The lexical category tl denotes transitive verb.
Here, the tracemay be generated by any movement transformation.
The thirdrule is for SVCs.
Note v2bar should have a subject and share it(Index) with the matrix verb.
Thus, the semantic features ofthe two are the same.
However, cases may be different.
Thatis, one is assigned by the matrix verb, and the other one by theembedded verb.
The rules for other lexical categories areomitted in this paper.
The details can refer to/Lin 1989/.4.4 Ba-constructionBa-construction is usually generated by ba-transformation,which is one of the movement ransformations.
Tile directobject is placed immediately after '|P2' (ba) and before the verblike:subject '~' (ba) _direct ~ verb.For example,~J~ }~, -~)'~',: N:i ~l~ ~ t i -\]" o (I sold all three books.
)t Iowever, there is another pattern for ba-construction:subject '\]\[.q' (ba) ~ verb ~ .It is not constructed by movement transfom\]ation becanse somenoun phrase appears after verb, i.e., ot!ject 2.
For example,~J~ }U ~ ~ !aZ T =_:Z ~ o (I ate three of apples.
)It shows a part-whole relation between object 1 and object 2.In the well-performed parsing systems, all the two patternsmust be treated.
It is also easy to represent this constructionwith our formalism.4.5 Bei-constructionBei-construction is a familiar Chinese pattern like thefollowing:n o n n ~  ~gU (bei) noun phrase 2 verb.For example,(The bird was let go (by me).
)Bei-construction has disposal shown as below similar toba-construction:~I~ ~ I"1 ~ ?~ } l~} T ~ I~I il~ o(That door was kicked (by naB) and a hole is left.
)The rules in Section 4.1 (topic-comment s ructure) capture theabove phenomena.4 .6  Pronoun Resolut ionBinding Theory can be rephrased in the fol lowingprocedures.
Assume /3 is an anaphor, a pronominal, or anR-expression depending on which principle is used.
Eachelement/3 may have two sets: set of possible pairs and set offlnpossible pairs.
These two sets are denoted by possible-pairand impossible-pair espectively, and are defined in thefollowing:possible-pair(B )={ a I cx can co-index with/3 },impossible-pair(/3 )={ a I ca cannot co-index with 13 }.
(Principle A) For an acceptable sentence, try to find somesuch that ca is in /3 's Governing Category and c--commands/3.
Each a that is outside of this range should not have aco-index relationship with 13.
This principle defines two setsfor /3.
For example,(* Mr. Lee i said \[s that you saw yourselfiJ.
)possible-pair('~l  ')-- { '4~g' }(possible-pair(self)= { you }), andimpossible-pair('l~ ~ ')= { ~ 5~,*-~" ' }(impossible-pair(self)={Mr. Lee\]).Both '4~;' (you) and '~5~ J_~.= ' (Mr. Lee) c-command '~  t~ '(self).
The former is in the governing category of the reflexive' ~ ~ '  (self), but the latter is outside.
So the index assignmentis not acceptable.
(Principle B) Those a s that are in tile range of GoverningCategory and c-command /3 should not co-index with /3.This principle just says which a s cannot be in the candidateset.
However, we cannot determine whether those cx s that arein its range and do not c-command/3,  co-index with/3 or not.If such an a co-indexes with/3,  it must satisfy other criteria,e.g.
other binding principles, the same semantic feature, and soon.
Thus, this principle says only the i,qmssible-pair.
Forexample,* \ [ s~ i~-~ T ~2i \]o (* \[s Mr. Lee i saw himi\].
)impossible-pair('{ tg') = \[ ~ 3~ ~'  }(impossible-pair(him)= { Mr.
Le e }).The phrase ~ 3~t5'-~.'
(Mr. Lee) c-commands '~ '  (him), thusthey cannot be co-indexed based on Principle B. Considera~othcr example:* \[s {lgi~..~, 71" ~R-~i \ ]o  (* \ [sHei saw Mr.
Leeil.
)The R-expressiort does not c-command the pronominal.According to Principle B, we have no way to detemfine theirbinding relationship.
But if Principle C is applied, it can tell t,sthe index assignment is wrong,(Principle C) For any ca where a c-commands/3,  a oughtnot to have co-index relationship with/3.
This principle saysnothing for those a s that do not c-command /3.
A setimpossible-pair is defined from this principle.
For example,*~i~ \[s4~ ~-~ T ~ i \ ] o(* He i said \[s that you saw Mr.
Leei\].
)52  5impossible-pair(-'-4 !g~ 3~~'~ ') = { "(t~', 'gJ~' )(impossible-pair(Mr. Lee)={he, you }).The pronominal '~ '  (he) c-commands '~-3~'35' (Mr. Lee), sothey should have different indices.Based on these three principles, a post-processing routineembedded in the parser is used to determine the co-indexrelationship between constituents from the parse tree.
Thealgorithm is sinai:de: Traverse the parse tree, generate therelations possible-pair and impossible-pair.
If it is unknown upto now, a rehttion unknown is given temporarily.
When a newrelation possible-pair or impossible-pair s got, use it to checkall the unknown relations.
Retract he unknowns accordingly.Finally, assign the anaphors and pronominals suitable indicesbased on the relations possible-pair and irtwossible-pair.5.
Conclusion and RemarksMany natural langt, ages are flexible and context-sensitive.Mandarin Chinese is a famous example.
It is difficult tocapture tile linguistic phenoinena lot these languages incomputer.
This paper adopts GB Theory to deal with thisproblcm.
According to GB Theory, the rule of 'move - a 'moves anything anywhere, and the universal princil~les operateinteractively torule out the illegal movements.
Thus, the onlythings shoukt be declared in tim grammars ree:(1) which phrases are the possible mpty constituents,(2) which positions are their possible mpty sites,(3) which positions are their possible landing sites,(4) which phrasal categories are bounding nodes.In such cases, a robnst parser for n:ttural hmguages can bedesigned.
As an example, we represent many context-sensitiveconstructions in Mandarin Chinese, and do case marking andindex assignment for Chinese sentences.
An experime,mflChinese parser is running under the euvironments: (1)Vax-I 1/785, (2) Quintus Prolog, (3) lexicon with about 200words (about 33K bytes), and (4) about 150 production rules(about l I2K bytes).
Besides movement ransformation,pronotm resolution is another index assignment.
For welltreatment o\[ pronoun resolt, tion, the syntactic knowledge is notenough.
This is because the Binding Theory tells us much theimpossible pair, but little the possible pair.
Much moresemantic information should be included.Moreover, our GB approach is also useft,1 when we wouldlike to compose logical formulae from their syntacticcounterparts.
The idea is that the mapping between d-structureand s-struc.ture, as well as between s-structure and logical formare treated in the similar way.
The movement transformationbetween d-structure and s-structure tells us the relationshipanaong verb and its accolnpanying arguments.
The skeleton ofthe given 'verb is defined in tile lexicon, and base-generated inthe d-structure.
For example,'N  '(Subject,Object) (buy(Subject,Object)).The index assignment relates ~ '  (book) to the verb '.~:~ ' (buy)in the following sentence:(There is one bcmk i that every student bought i.
)Because the variable of the type -~- ' (book) and the secondargument of the template 'N '(Subject, Object) (buy(Subject,Object)) should be the same in the logical form, the index (aunique integer) can be changed into a variable, say X.
That is,they share the same variable shown below:exist(X,'i~ '(X),forall(Y,'-~ L'(Y),'N '(Y,X)))(exist(X,book(X),forall(Y,student(Y),buy(Y,X)))).The formtfla tells us the SVO-SOV inversion in the logicaltbrm.
This phenomenon can be added into our parser easilywith our formalism.
