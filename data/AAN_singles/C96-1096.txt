f iAbst rac tThe paper describes problems in dis-ambiguating the morphological analysisof Bantu languages by using Swahili asa test language.
The main factors ofambiguity in this language group canbe traced to the noun class structureon one hand and to the bi-directionalword-formation on the other.
In analyz-ing word-forms, the system applied uti-lizes SWATWOL, a morphological pars-ing program based on two-level formal-ism.
Disambiguation is carried out withthe latest version (April 1996) of theConstraint Grammar Parser (GGP).
Sta-tistics on ambiguity are provided.
So-lutions tbr resolving different types ofambiguity are presented and they aredemonstrated by examples fi'om corpustext.
Finally, statistics on the perfor-mance of the disambiguator are pre-sented.In t roduct ionThere are five principal factors in Bantu languageswhich contribute to ambiguous analysis of word-tbrms.
First, nouns are grouped into more thanten marked noun classes.
The marking of theseclasses extends across the noun phrase, wherebythe noun governs the choice of markers in de-pendent constituents.
Second, verbs inflect stem-initially and mark the subject, object, and rela-tive referent by prefixes, whereby the actual formof each prefix is governed by the noun class ofthe noun it refers to.
In addition, verb derivationalso adds to the complexity of verbal morphology.Third, reduplication is a productive phenomenon.Because its accurate description in lexicon is notpossible, alternative ways in handling it are dis-cussed.
Fourth, the majority of Bantu languageshave a tone system, but rarely this is indicatedin writing.
This adds to morphological mbiguity.Fifth, various semantic functions of word-formsare also a source of ambiguity.In this paper I shall discuss the points one andtwo by using Swahili as a test language.1 Morpho log ica l  analysisThe morphological analysis of Swahili is carriedout by SWATWOL, which is based on the two-level formalism (Koskenniemi 1983).
The ap-plication of this formalism to Swahili has beenunder process since 1987, and it has now, af-ter having been tested with a corpus of one mil-lion words, reached a mature phase with a recallof 99.8% in average running text, and precisionof close to 100%.
The performance of SWAT-WOL corresponds to what is reported of ENGT-WOL, the morphological parser of English (Vouti-lainen et al1992; Tapanainen and J/irvinen 1994),and SWETWOL, the morphological analyzer ofSwedish (Karlsson 1992).SWATWOL uses a two-level rule system fordescribing morphophonological v riation, as wellas a lexicon with 288 sub-lexicons.
Unlike inlanguages with right-branching word formation,where word roots can be grouped together intoa root lexicon, here word roots have been dividedinto several sub-lexicons.Because SWATWOL has been described in de-tail elsewhere (Hurskainen 1992), only a sketchydescription of its parts is given here.1.1 SWATWOL rulesTwo-level rules have been written mainly for han-dling morhophonological processes, which occurprincipally in morpheme boundaries.
Part of suchprocesses take place also in verbal extensions,whereby the quality of the stem vowel(s) definesthe surface form of the suffix.
The total numberof rules is 18, part of them being combined rules.An example of a combined rule:568U:w <=> k _ :Vo  ;t _ / :  a: ;Chanqe lexical 'U' to surface 'w' iff there is 'k'on the lcft and a surface character belonging tothe set 'Vo' on the right; or there is 't' on the leftand a lexical diacritic '/1' on the right followed bya lexical 'a '.1.2 SWATWOL lexiconSWATWOL lexicon is at tree, where the mor-phemes of Swahili are located so that each routef?om the root lexicon leads to a well-formed word-tbrm.The most complicated part of the lexicon is thedescription of verb-forms, which requires a total of:\[25 sub-lexicons.
For describing verbs, there area number of consecutive :prefix and suffix 'slots',which may or may not be filled by morphemes.The verb root is in the middle, and verbal exten-sions used mainly for derivation are suffixed to theroot.A noun is composed of a class prefix androot.
Noun roots are located in 22 separate sub-lexicons, and access to them is permitted fromthe corresponding class prefix(es).
Adjectives aregrouped according to whether they t, ake class pre-fixes or not.
Also numerals are grouped accordingto the same principle.
The lexicon has a total ofabout 27,000 'words'.Here is a simplified example of a sab-lexicon:LEXICON M/MImU M/MIr "mU 3/4-SG N";mi M/MIr "mU 3/4-PL N";This is a sub-lexicon with the name 'M/MI' con-taining prefixes of the noun classes 3 and 4.
Eachentry may have three parts, but only the mid-dle part is compulsory.
In the first entry, 'mU'is the lexical representation of a morpheme, and'M/MIr'  is the name of the sub-lexicon where theprocessing will continue.
The third part withinquotes is the output string.In constructing the lexicon, underspecificationof analysis was avoided.
Although it may be usedfor decreasing the number of ambiguous readings(of.
Karlsson 1992), it leaves ambiguity withinreadings themselves in the form of underspecifica-*ion, and it has to be resolved later in any case.2 Extent  o f  morpho log ica lambigu i ty1,'or the purposes of writing and testing disarn-biguation rules, a corpus of about 10,000 wordsof prose text was compiled (Corpus 1).
The textTable 1: Number of readings of word-fbrms inSwahili test corpus (Corpus 1).
N(r) = numberof readings, N(t) = number of word-form tokens,% = percent of the total, cure-% = cumulativepercentageN(r) N(t) % cure-%1 4653 48.74 48.742 2061 21.59 70.333 871 9.12 79.554 1047 10.97 90.525 542 5.68 96.206 162 1.70 97.907 49 0.51 98.418 22 0.23 98.649 34 0.36 99.0010 33 0.35 99.351\] or more 72 0.75 100.00was analyzed with SWATWOL, and the results inregard to ambiguity are given in Table 1.As can be seen in Table 1, about half of word-form tokens in Swahili are at least two-ways am-biguous.
About one fifth of tokens are preciselytwo-ways ambiguous, and the share of three-waysand four-ways ambiguous tokens is almost equal,about 10%.
The share of five-ways ambiguoustokens is 5.68%, but the number of still moreambiguous tokens decreases drastically.
Thereare word-forms with more than 20 readings, tilelargest number in the corpus being 60 readings.If we compare these numbers with those in Ta-ble 2 we note significant differences and similari-ties.
Table 2 was constructed exactly in the samemanner as Table 1, only the source text being dif-ferent.
Whereas in Table 1 a corpus of runningtext (Corpus 1) was used, in Table 2 the sourcetext was a list of unique word-forms (Corpus 2).The number of word-forms with more than onereading is almost equal in both corpora, slightlyover 50%.
The percentages in Table 2 decreaserather systematically the more readings a word-form has.
While there were more four-waysambiguous word-forms (10.97%) than three-waysones (9.12%) in Table 1, in Table 2 the numbersare as expected.
The only unexpected result isthe share of six-ways ambiguous words (3.44%),which is higher than the share of the five-waysambiguous ones (2.94%).
In Corpus 2, the highpercentage offour-ways ambiguous readings foundin Corpus 1 does not exist.The ambiguity rate in Swahili is somewhatlower than in Swedish (60%, Berg 1978).
It seemsto correspond to that of English (Voutilainen ct al1992:5), although Dett.ose (1988) gives somewhat569Table 2: Number of readings of word-forms inSwahili list of unique word-forms (Corpus 2).
N(r)= number of readings, N(t) = number of word-form tokens, % = percent of the total, cum-% =cumulative percentageN(r) N(t) % cure-%i 4960 48.13 48.132 2294 23.99 72.123 1031 10.78 82.904 568 5.94 88.845 281 2.94 91.786 329 3.44 95.227 102 1.07 96.298 88 0.92 97.219 85 0.89 98.1010 34 0.36 98.4611 ormore 148 1.54 100.00lower figures, 11% for word-form types and 40%for word-form tokens.
In Finnish the correspond-ing figures are still lower, 3.3% for word-formtypes and 11.2% for word-form tokens (Niemiko-rpi 1979).While the reported ambiguity counted fromword-form tokens is generally much higher thanthat counted from word-form types, in Swahili thedifference is small.
This is due to the fact that inaddition to ambiguity found in several of the mostcommon words, verb-forms are typically ambigu-ous, as are almost half of the nouns.Karlsson (1994:23) suggests an inverse correla-tion between the number of unique word-formsand rate of ambiguity.
Therefore, heavily inflect-ing languages would tend to produce unambigu-ous word-forms.
Swahili does not seem to fullysupport this hypothesis, although the numbers inTable 1 and 2 are not directly comparable withresults of other studies.
In Swahili lexicon, under-specification was avoided which adds to ambiguity.3 Disambiguation with Constra intGrammar  ParserMorphological disambiguation as well as syntac-tic mapping is carried out with Constraint Gram-mar Parser (CGP).
Descriptions of its develop-ment phases are found in several publications (e.g.Karlsson 1.990; Karlsson 1994a, 1994b; Karlssonet al1994; Voutilainen et al1992; Voutilainenand Tapanainen 1993; Tapanainen 1996).
It setsoff from the idea that rather than trying to writerules by pointing out the conditions necessary forthe acceptance of a reading in an ambiguous case,it allows the writing of such rules that discard acertain reading as illegitimate.
The rule system istypically a combination of deletion and selectionrules.The morphological nalyzer SWATWOL was sodesigned that it would be ideal for further process-ing with CGP.
The output of SWATWOL containssuch information as part-of-speech features, fea-tures for adjectives, verbs, adverbs, nouns, numer-als, and pronouns, as well as information on nounclass marking (also zero marking) wherever it oc-curs, etc.
In the present application also syntactictags are included into the morphological lexiconas far as the marking can be done unambiguously.The syntactic mapping of context-sensitive word-forms is left to the CGP.In order to simplify disambiguatiOn, fixedphrases, idioms, multi-word prepositions and non-ambiguous collocations are joined together al-ready in the preprocessing phase of the text (e.g.mbele ya > mbele_ya 'in front of'), and the sameconstructions are written into the lexicon withcorresponding analysis.3.1 Const ra in t  Grammar  ru le  fo rmal i smThe subsequent discussion of the ConstraintGrammar Parser is based on the formalism ofTapanainen (1996).
A detailed description of anearlier version of CGP is in Karlsson (1994b).
TheCGP rule file has the following sections (optionalones in parentheses):DELIMITERS(PREFERRED-TARGET)(SETS)(MAPPINGS)CONSTRAINTSENDIn DELIMITERS, those tags are listed whichmark the boundary of context conditions.
If therule system tries to remove all readings of a cohort,the target listed in the section PREFERRED-TARGET is the one which survives.
SETS is asection where groups of tags are defined.
Syntac-tic parsing is carried out with rules located underthe heading MAPPINGS.
CONSTRAINTS con-tains constraint rules with tile following schema:\[WORDFORM\] OPERATION (target)\[(context condition(s) )\]WORDFORM can be any surface word-form,for which a rule will be written.
OPERATIONmay have two forms: REMOVE and SELECT.These are self-explanatory.
In TARGET is de-fined the concrete morphological tag (or sequenceof tags), to which the operation is applied.
A tar-get may be also a set, which is defined in the SETS570section.
If the target is left without parentheses itis interpreted as a set.
CONTEXT CONDITIONSis an optional part, but in most cases necessary.In it, conditions for the application of tile rule aredefined in detail.
Context conditions are definedin relation to the target reading, which has thedefault  position 0.
Positive integers refer to thenumber of words to the right, and the negativeones to the left.
In context conditions, referencecan be made to any of the features or tags foundin the unambiguous reading, e.g.
(1C ADJ), or inthe whole cohort, e.g.
(1 ADJ).
These referencescan be made either directly to a tag or indirectlythrough sets, which are defined in a special section(SETS) of the rule formalism.Any context may also be negated by placing thekey-word NOT to the beginning of the contextclause.
It is also possible to refer to more thanone context in the same position.If there is a need to define further conditionsfor a reading found by scanning (by using positionmarkers *-1 or *1), the linking mechanism ay beused.
This can be done by adding the key-wordLINK to the context, whereafter the new contextfollows.
For example, the context condition (*-1N LINK 1 PP~ON LINK 1 ADJ) reads: 'there is anoun (N) on the left followed by pronoun (PI{ON)followed by and adjective (ADJ)'.3.2 Order  of  ru lesThe algorithm allows a sequential rule order.
Thiscan be done by grouping the rules into separatesections.
The sequential order of rules within asection does not guarantee that the rules are ap-plied in the order where they appear.
The rulesof the first section are applied first.
Any num-ber of consecutive sections can be used.
Thereare presently four sections of constraint rules inthe rule file.
Certain types of rules should be ap-plied first, without giving a possibility to other, lessclearly stated, rules to interfere.
Typical of suchfirst-level rules are those where disambiguation isdone within a phrase structure.
In intermediatesections there are rules which use larger struc-tures for disambiguation.
By first disambiguatingnoun phrases and genitive constructions, the useof otherwise too permissive rules becomes possi-ble, when clear cases are already disambiguated.The disambiguation f verbJorms belongs to thesemiddle levels.
2?he risk of wrong interpretationsdecreases ubstantially by first disambiguatingnoun phrases and other smaller units.The CGP of Swahili has presently a total of 656rules in four different sections for disambiguationand 50 rules for syntactic mapping.
So far about600 hours have been used for writing and testingrnles.4 Disambiguation of a samplesentenceBelow is a Swahili sample sentence after morpho-logical analysis and after CG disambiguation.

Rule S:816 removes an object reading ofthe word-form.
After that, a selection rule S:1099is applied.SELECT (I/2-PL N)(i NCL-2 + GEN-CON) ;Select noun reading of Ncl 1/2-PL if followedimmediately by genitive connector belonging to theset NCL-2.
This description is equal to the gram-matical rule.
Also other rules follow the sameprinciple.
E.g.
the reading 1/2-PL GEN-CONis chosen for the analysis of wa on the basis of theNcl of the preceding noun.
The rule states:"<wa>" SELECT (1/2-eL)( - t  NCL-2) ;Select Ncl 1/2-PL of the word 'wa' if in the pre-ceding cohort there is a feature belonging to the setNCL-2.Although both washiriki and wa are initiallyambiguous, and in rules the context reference doesnot extend beyond this pair of words, we get thecorrect result.
This is because in both of the co-horts there is only one such reading which refersto the same noun class.The word semina is both SG and PL, and thefollowing pronoun zote, which has the PL read-ing, solves the problem.
The word nchi is dis-ambiguated with a rule relying on the Ncl of thefollowing genitive connector (GEN-CON).The word katika has four readings.
The gram-matically correct way of disambiguating it is byreferring to the following word.
"<katika>" SELECT (PREPOS)(I N OR INF OR PRON)Select the reading PREPOS of "katika" if there isa noun or infinitive of a verb or pronoun in thefollowing cohort.i5 Success  ra te  and  remain ingprob lems o f  d i sambiguat ionThe CGP of Swahili was tested with two text cor-pora, which had not been used as test materialin writing rules: E. Kezilahabi's novel Mzingile(22,984 word-form tokens), and a collection ofnewspaper texts from the weekly paper Mzalendo,1994 (49,969 word-form tokens).
Test results arein Table 3.Table 3: Ambiguity after processing with theSwahili CGP.
N(t) = number of word-form tokens,N(w) = number of unique word-forms, amb-(t)= ambiguity in tokens, amb-(w) = ambiguity inunique word-forms.Ambiguity Mzingile MzalendoN(t) 22,984 49,968N(w) 5,914 9,359amb-(t) 1,837 2,463% 7.99 4.93amb-(w) 721 831% 12.19 8.88The parser performed best with newspapertexts, leaving ambiguity to 4.9% of tokens.
Yetthe overall result has to be considered promising,given that the parser is still under developmentand that the rules are almost solely grammar-based.The most common types of ambiguity still re-maining are: noun vs. adverb, adjective vs. ad-verb, noun vs. conjunction, verb (imperative) vs.noun, and verb (infinitive) vs. noun.
Those aretypically in such positions in a sentence that writ-ing of reliable rules is difficult.
A fairly large partof remaining ambiguity concerns genitive connec-tors ya and wa, and possessive pronouns.
They aregenerally in positions where the governing noun isbeyond the current clause or sentence boundaryon the left.
For such cases, the rule syntax should572allow the use of more distantly located informa-tion.The vast majority of constraints are selectionrules for resolving ambiguity based on homo-graphic noun class agreement markers, lit is pos-sible to resolve most of this ambiguity by usingcontextual information.Conc lus ionThe morphologicM anMysis of SwMfili tends toproduce a comparatively large number of ambigu-ous readings.
The noun class structure coupledwith class agreement marking in dependent con-stituents, contributes ignificantly to ambiguity.The phenomenon is particularly evident in verbstructures, where different sets of noun class mark-ers add to the ambiguity of the same verb-form.
Itis assumed that the solutions uggested here applyMso to other Bantu languages.The ambiguity resolution is based on the Con-straint Grammar formMism, which allows tile useof grammatically motivated rules.
The maximalcontext in the present application is a sentence,but there is a need for extending it over sentenceboundaries.
ConstrMnt rules are grouped into sec-tions, so thai; the most obvious cases are disam-biguated first.
A parser wiLt~ only grammar-basedrules disambiguatcs M)out 95% or Swahili word-tbrms from running text, which initiMly has about50% of the tokens ambiguous.
The remaining am-biguity is hard to resolve fully safely, but proba-bilistic and hcnristic techniques are likely to stillimprove tile pertbrmance.ReferencesBerg, Stare.
