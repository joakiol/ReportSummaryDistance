LINGUISTICS AND AUTOMATED LANGUAGE PI~OCESSING 10.1 Th is  paper  is concerned  with natura l  l anguage ,  computers ,and two groups  of people  in teres ted  in natura l  language:  \ ] ingu is ts ,  andpersons  engaged in computer  p rocess ing  of natura l  l anguage  data .There  is  some in tersect ion  of the la t te r  se ts ,  but the in tersect ion  isquite smal l  re la t ive  to the s i ze  of the sets  themse lves  and is  thus  in -adequate  to p rov ide  l ingu is ts  with a p roper  perspect ive  on automatedlanguage process ing ,  or computer  sc ient i s ts  with a p roper  perspec -t ive on l ingu is t i cs .A l though both groups  of persons  have  a mutua l  in te res t  in natur -a l  l anguage ,  the i r  conceptua l i za t ions  of the nature  of language and the i rapproaches  to p rocess ing  language data a re  very  d i f fe rent .
To presenta somewhat  overs imp l i f i ed  v iew of these  d i f fe rences :  l ingu is ts  tend tobe theory -or iented- - they  are  concerned  with in teres t ing  but  somet imesqu i teesoter l c  p rob lems,  counter -examples ,  and the in f in i te  se t  ofsentences  of competence ;  on the other  hand,  persons  engaged in  auto -mated  language process ing  tend to be data -or iented ,  and are  concernedwith s ta t i s t i ca l  s ign i f i cance  and with some f in i te  subset  of the sentencesof per fo rmance .
The quest ion  there fore  a r i ses  as  to whether  thesed i f fe rent  perspect ives  a re  to be in terpreted  as  incompat ib le  or comple -r:~entary, and if complementary ,  whether  some research  concept  mightp rov ide  the means  for  a un i f ied approach  to ana lys i s  of natura l  l anguage .In th i s  paper ,  Sect ion  1 dea ls  wi th  the perspect ive  of l i ngu is ts  onautomated  language process ing  and computer  sc ient i s ts  on l ingu is t i cs ;Sect ion  Z d i scusses  the i r  respect ive  concepts  of natura l  l anguage  andl I  arn indebted to Pau l  GarT in  for  h i s  va luab le  comments  onth is  paper .and the i r  approaches  to ana lys i s  of natura l  l anguage ,  and exp lo res  thequest ions  ra i sed  above;  Sect ion  3 presents  some conc lud ing  remarks .1.

The in teres t  of l i ngu is ts  in natura l  l anguage  isg iven  by  def in i t ion;  the in teres t  of non- l ingu is t i ca l l y  o r iented  computerspec ia l i s t s  in natura l  l anguage  der ives  not f rom a concern  with languageper  se,  but  f rom the funct ion  of language as  the pr imary  veh ic le  forcommunicat ing  in fo rmat ion  in human soc ie ty .
Whether  or  not oneaccepts  the idea of the so -ca l led  " in fo rmat ion  exp los ion ,  " the process ingof natura l  l anguage  text  is  an impor tant  cha l lenge  for both l ingu is t i csand computer  sc ience .
The  sheer  vo lume of natura l  l anguage  in fo rma-t ion is  tax ing manua l  sys tems to the point  where  most  o rgan izat ionswh ich  engage  in la rge  sca le  in fo rmat ion  process ing  are  tu rn ing  to auto-mat ion  of operat ions  on natura l  l anguage  text.
While most  l ingu is tsa re  specu la t ing  on the theory  of language,  computer  sc ient i s ts  with l i t t leor  no l ingu is t i c  background are  a t tempt ing  to const ruc t  sys tems forana lyz ing  the content  of natura l  l anguage  mater ia l s .
Obv ious ly ,  l i n -gu is ts  shou ld  become invo lved  in th is  deve lopment ,  but  to date,  fewl ingu is ts  have  been  mot ivated  to par t i c ipate .
It appears  that  there  a retwo bas ic  reasons  for  the cur rent  lack  of invo lvement .1.

1 In the f i r s t  place~ among l ingu is ts  there  is l i t t le  apprec ia t ion  ofthe fac t  that  in essence ,  a l l  p rocess ing  of natura l  l anguage  in fo rmat ion - -whether  sc ient i f i c ,  techn ica l ,  or  l i te rary - - i s  a l ingu is t i c  p rob lem.Bas ica l l y ,  the process ing  of natura l  l anguage  in fo rmat ion  for  index ing,abs t rac t ing ,  fac t  re t r ieva l ,  t rans la t ion ,  or  any  o ther  purpose  requ i resan ana lys i s  of the content  of the text  and the representat ion  of it  insome s tandard  fo rm.
Idea l ly ,  content  ana lys i s  cons is ts  in determin ingthe concepts  present  in the mater ia l  and the in ter re la t ions  ex is t ingamong those  concepts ;  the fo rmer  is  based  on some fo rm of semant icana lys i s ,  and the le t te r  imp l ies  syntact i c  ana lys i s~ a l though the twofo rms of ana lys i s  a re  in terdependent  to a cons iderab le  degree .The  concepts  and re la t ions  wh ich  have been ident i f ied  are  thent rans la ted  into a set  of canon ic  sentences  represent ing  ~he content  ofthe document .

Z A further--and not unrelated--reason for non-participalionlinguists in automated language processing is a basic lack of knowledgeabout computers~ in the sense of realizing when a computer  is a handytool~ and when it isn't so handy.
By  this I don't mean a lack of knowl-edge about hexadecimal  systems, bits and bytes, or serial and parallelprocessors, but very simply knowledge of what  a computer  is good for.4The  fac t  is  that  for  many  of the operat ions  character i s t i ca l l y  per*fo rmed in l ingu is t i c  research ,  the computer  is  an  inva luab le - - i f  not anind ispensab le - - too l .
Th is  is  a very  s t rong  c la im for the ut i l i ty  of thecomputer  in l ingu is t i cs ;  there fore ,  the grounds  on which  it is  basedare  wor th  examin ing  in some deta i l .The  operat ions  wh ich  the l ingu is t  per fo rms in car ry ing  out researchon a language or  languages  are  essent ia l l y  the fol lowing: he co l lec tsdata ,  o rgan izes  and ana lyzes  them,  fo rmula tes  hypotheses  and ver i f iesthem.
There  is  of course ,  a g reat  dea l  of feedback  ana lys i s  andrecyc l ing  th rough al l  these  operat ions ,  which are  h igh ly  in terdependent .I t  i s  there fore  impract i ca l  to examine  the app l i cab i l i ty  of computer  p ro -cess ing  ind iv idua l ly  to each  of the operat ions  l i s ted  above.
S ince theimpor tant  concept  of "o rgan izat ion"  app l ies  equa l ly  to data and hypothe-ses ,  in the fo l lowing the l ingu is t i c  operat ions  for wh ich  computers  canbe used  wi l l  be grouped into these  two categor ies .
Where  these  oper -a t ions  a re  d i f fe rent ly  in terpreted  or va lued by l ingu is ts  of d i f fe rentschoo ls ,  d ivergent  po ints  of v iew wil l  be noted.Data  co l lec t ion  and  organ izat ion ,  operat ions  on the data base .There  a re  two senses  in which data is  co l lec ted  in l ingu is t i c  ana lys i s .The  f i r s t  sense  re fers  to the in i t ia l  co l lec t ion  of data for  inc lus ion  inthe corpus  or  data  base .
For  a l ingu is t  work ing  with a language un-known to h im,  th i s  genera l ly  means  e l i c l t ing  such  data f rom an in fo r -0mant - -a  nat ive  speaker  of the language in quest ion .
Th is  operat ioncan not  p roceed  in a haphazard  manner ,  but  for  the t rad i t iona l  descr ip -t ive l ingu is t  at  leas t ,  is one subcornponent  of a heur i s t i c  s t ra tegy  ford i scover ing  the bas ic  e lements  and  re la t ions  of a g iven language.
Be-5cause it is a heuristic rather than an algorithmic procedure, explica-tion for a computer  is a formidable undertaking.
Thus  far, there hasbeen only one attempt at automating parad igm elicitation for unknownlanguages (Garvin 1969): since this project also involves analysis andhypothesis formulation, a more  detailed discussion will be presentedbelow.A second sense  of data co l lec t ion  is  the se lec t ion  of par t i cu la rdata i tems f rom a prev ious ly  co l lec ted  data base .
-When work ing  witha language in which he does  not have nat ive  or near  nat ive  competence ,operat ions  on the data base- - that  is to say,  o rgan iz ing ,  search ing ,re t r ievh lg ,  and re f i l ing  data - -assume a dominant  ro le .
Th is  is  becausethe l ingu is t  cannot  re ly  on h imse l f  as  a source  of data  which  he canorgan ize  and ana lyze  in te rms  of h is  own competence  ( th is  p rocedurepresents  another  type of p rob lem,  which  is  d i scussed  in Sect ion  Z).The anthropo log ica l  l i ngu is t  thus  must  devote a d i spropor t ionate  amountof t ime s imp ly  to operat ing  on the data base ,  and espec ia l l y  to o rgan-i z ing his data.
He typ ica l ly  records  h is  data i tems on smal l  s l ips  ofpaper ,  wh ich  he then sor ts  and c ross - f i l es  accord ing  to var ious  c r i te r ia .The prob lem is that he can only  c ross - f i l e  a data i tem as  many  ways  ashe has  dupl icate s l ips ,  an o r ig ina l  and three  carbons  be ing  about  thel im i t  of leg ib i l i ty  in record ing  data with a pen or penc i l .
The  fourcop ies  a l low h im,  for instanc4' ,  a lphasor ted  f i les  of Eng l i sh /LanguageL,  Language L /Eng l i sh  and two morpho log ica l  c lass i f i ca t ions .
If thelanguage is  a tone language other than I raqw--an african language inwhich tone and morphological classes coincide--four files are insuffi-cent even for morphological analysis; for syntactic and semantic analysis,6such a limitation constitutes a serious obstacle.There are two major problems inherent in these traditional data-handling methods, which may provide at least a partial explanation forthe well-known inadequacies in the descriptions of the so-called "exotic"languages (Uhlenbeck 1960 ).
In the first place, the operations in-volved in the creation of these files, retrieval of relevant data fromthem, and replacement of the data in the files require a great deal ofthe llnguistts time, which might be more  profitably spent in analysisand in hypothesis formulation and verification.
Secondly, because ina taxonomic approach, classifications contained in the files in effectform the basis of the grammar ,  and because syntactic and semanticanalysis requires a highly sophisticated and extensive organizationof the data, these aspects of linguistic research inevitably suffer whendata handling is limited to traditional manual techniques.Now,  the clerical operations of sorting and listing data rapidlyand variously are just those at which the computer excels.
The com-puter can speed i ly  p resent  a var ie ty  of a r rangements  of la rge  vo lumesof data,  which may expose under ly ing pat terns  not ident i f iab le - -o rident i f iab le  only with d i f f i cu l ty - -by  means  of t rad i t iona l  card  f i l ingtechn iques .
The poss ib i l i t i es  for automat ing these types of operat ionshave yet  to be ful ly explo i ted;  however ,  p rograms for generat ingmorpheme concordances  have been deve loped by Gr imes  and byI7Kay (1969).

A l though a computer  cannot  spontaneous lygenerate  hypotheses ,  it can  ass i s t  the l ingu is t  in recogn iz ing  pat ternsin the data.
Moreover ,  in o rgan iz ing  and ver i fy ing  hypotheses ,  thecomputer  may wel l  be an  ind ispensab le  too l  In o rder  to tes t  a hypoth -es i s ,  it  shou ld  be s ta ted  as  exp l i c i t l y  as  poss ib le ;  use  of the computerfo rces  the invest igator  to be exp l i c i t .

Such  requ i re -ments  apply equa l ly  to fo rmal  g rammars  and the somewhat  moreloose ly  o rgan ized  descr ip t ive  grammars .T rans format iona l  g rammars ,  however ,  p resent  a par t i cu la r lyconv inc ing  case  for the ne~cessity of computer  tes t ing .

The des ign  of cer ta in  types of morpho log ica lana lys i s  a lgor i thms for par t i cu la r  languages  is in fact  fa i r i )  wellunders tood .
Reasonab ly  success fu l  suf f ix  ana lys i s  a lgor i thms havebeen  des igned  for  Russ ian  (Ramo Wooldr idge  1960) and for  Eng l i shChap in  19 6 7; Ear l  1967}.Numerous  computer  p rograms with var ious  theoret i ca l  baseshave been  des igned  for  ana lyz ing  syntax .
These  inc lude var ious  ver -s ions  of the Cocke  a lgor i thm- -a  bot tom-to - top  pars ing  logic  whichuses  a table of b inary  IC grammar  ru les  to deve lop s imu l taneous lyal l  poss ib le  ana lyses  of an input s t r ing  (for a d i scuss ion  of the Cockelog ic ,  see  Hays  1966, pp.
75-7;  for  recent  app l i ca t ions  of the Cocke9a lgor i thm in automated  language process ing ,  see Montgomery  1969).A top - to -bot tom pred ic t ive  equiva lent  of the Cocke a lgor i thm is theKuno-Oet t inger  Syntact ic  Ana lyzer  (Kuno 1965).
Both these a lgor i thms,however ,  suf fer  f rom the d isadvantage of produc ing mul t ip le  ana lyses .More  ef fect ive procedures  for syntact ic  ana lys i s  incorporate  t rans -fo rmat iona l  ru les ;  these include the MITRE Syntact ic  Ana lys i s  P ro -cedure  and that descr ibed  by Mart in  Kay (1967).
Another  approach  tosyntact ic  ana lys i s  is the " fu lc rum"  method,  repor ted  in Garv in  (1968),in which the grammar  and the pars ing  logic are  both incorporated  intothe ana lys is  a lgor i thm.Although the synthet ic  ru le test ing sys tems d iscussed  above areuseful  only for test ing fo rmal  g rammars ,  the analyt ic  a lgor i thmsmight  a lso be used  to tes t  t rad i t ional  descr ip t ive  grammars .
In thecase  of descr ip t ive  grammars ,  c r i te r ia  for  o rder ing  and exhaust ivenessa re  somewhat  less  r igorous ly  spec i f ied  than in fo rmal  g rammar ;  adescr ip t ive  grammar  is never the less  in in t r i ca te  network  of complex lyin ter re la ted  s ta tements  in which some.
incons is tency  is probab le  if notunavoidable.
It would appear  that the most  e f fect ive  means  of p re -eluding such a poss ib i l i ty  is through sys temat ic  omputer  tes t ing .At p resent ,  the most  versat i le  device for test ing a descr ip t ivegrammar  is probab ly  some vers ion  of the Cocke a lgor i thm,  whichcould be used  as a morpho log ica l  ana lyzer  with a set  of morpho log ica lru les ,  and as a syntact ic  ana lyzer  with a set  of syntact ic  ru les .
Inmorpho log ica l  ana lys i s ,  the input s t r ing  would cons is t  of codes repre -sent ing the morphs  occupying the success ive  pos i t ion c lasses  whichfo rm the par t i cu la r  word.
In syntact ic  ana lys i s ,  the input s t r ing  wouldI0of course consist of codes constituting the grammatical labels of thewords which form the particular sentence.Finally, it is appropriate to discuss a computer application whichis noteworthy not only by virtue of the fact that it is in the descriptivetradition, but also because it constitutes a substantial departure fromthe above-mentioned algorithms in several important respects (Garvin1969).
First, both the analytic and synthetic computer systems dis-cussed above are mechan isms for testing a grammar  of a particularlanguage; hence, they accept test data and hypotheses in the form ofgrammatical rules as input and produce as output various diagnosticsshowing how the data were analyzed by the rules.
On  the other hand,Garvin's program collects unanalyzed data in an ordered manner bymeans  of its elicitation subcomponent, applies theoretical assumptionsto the data, and outputs a hypothesis about the morphological structureof the language represented by the data.
Second, rather than testing agrammar  of a par t i cu la r  language,  the immediate  object ive of the pro -g ram is to tes t  a theory  of l ingu is t ic  ana lys i s  as represented  by a d i s -covery  procedure  and the u l t imate  ob ject ive  is to exp l icate  the un iver -sa l  and near  un iversa l  assumpt ions  ( l inguist ic  universals)" that areimp l i c i t  in the operat ions  of the l inguist ic  ana lysL  Th i rd ,  the programthus inc ludes  al l  the operat ions  which a descr ip t ive  l ingu is t  per fo rms,except  for hypothes is  ver i f i cat ion .

2 The linguistJs failure to recognize the significance forlinguistics of natural language information is paralleled by the failure11on the par t  of many persons  engaged in automated  language process ingto recogn ize  that the prob lem is essent ia l l y  a l ingu is t ic  one, More -over ,  the l ingu is t ' s  lack of knowledge about the computer  as a versat i lelanguage process ing  tool is complemented  by the lack of l ingu is t icknowledge of his computat iona l ly -o r iented  counterpar t .Examples  of non- l ingu is t i ca l l y  o r iented  computer  p rocess ing  ofnatura l  language data in the guise of content  ana lys i s  a re  too nurne rousto ment ion  in deta i l - - the  c lass ica l  example  is Luhn ls  "KWIC I~ concept(Luhn 1959) and its mult i tudinous misapp l i ca t ions  (for an exhaust ivel i s t ing of these through 1964, seeStevens  1965).
Examples  of some-what more  soph is t i ca ted  approaches  include the var ious  a t tempts  toident i fy  concepts  and the re la t ions  obtaining between concepts  withoutrecourse  to a sys temat ic  syntact ic  ana lys is  of the given text.

Never the less ,  these two groups of personshave a common in teres t  in natura l  language.
It is there fore  approp-pr ia te  to examif le the i r  perspect ives  on the nature  of language.
Gen-e ra l l y  speaking,  the i r  v iewpoints  tend to be d ichotomous;  theseoppos i t ions  Under l ie  the prob lems d iscussed  above.12Z.
0 In essence ,  l ingu is ts  (espec ia l l y  those  of the fo rmal  de -sc r ip t ive  school )  a re  theory -or iented ;  persons  engaged in automatedlanguage process ing  are  data -or iented .
Moreover ,  most  l ingu is tswould agree  that  a l ingu is t i c  theory  can be d i sproved  by a s ing le  counter -example ,  no mat ter  how unl ike ly ;  whereas  researchers  in automatedlanguage process ing  are  not d i s turbed  by an incompat ib le  p iece ofdata  un less  i ts  p robab i l i ty  of occur rence  threatens  the pract i ca l  ob jec -t ive  of the app l i ca t ion .
L ingu is ts  search  the inf in i te  se t  of a natura ll anguage  for the i r  counter -examples  whi le persons  engaged in auto -mated  language process ing  pare  natura l  l anguage  down to an oftenske le ta l  subset ,  jus t  to exc lude  data which wil l  per turb  the i r  sys tem.L ingu is ts  a re  concerned  with the ideal  of competence ;  automatedlanguage process ing  researchers  must  dea l  with the fac ts  of per fo r -mance- - ' the  adu l te ra t ions  of the idea l "  (Katz 1967).I f  one takes  a negat ive  point  of v iew, these  d ichotomies  repre -sent  i r reconc i lab le  diffe rence  s in the bas ic  concept ion  of language ;more  pos i t i ve ly ,  they  may be regarded  as  complementary  perspect iveson the nature  of language.
The  in i t ia l  i ssue  is  thus  one of determin ingwh ich  v iew is  cor rec t .
Should  the pos i t i ve  v iew be adopted,  there  isa more  fundamenta l  quest ion  as  to the potent ia l  for  un i fy ing the twoapproaches  to p rov ide  a ba lanced  a t tack  on prob lems of natura ll anguage  ana lys i s  and descr ip t ion .iIn answer  to the f i r s t  quest ion ,  it i s  reasonab le  to cons ider  thetwo approaches  as  complementary ,  s ince  the spec i f i c  weaknesses  ofthe data -or lented  pos i t ion  a re  o f f se t  by cor respond ing  s t rengths  in thetheoret i ca l  o r ienta t ion ,  and converse ly .
In the fo l lowing d i scuss ion ,13 /the respect ive  de f i c ienc ies  of the two approaches  wil l  be examined andpotent ia l  unifying Concepts wil l  be exp lored .2.1 The data -or iented  view of natura l  language is genera l lycharacterized by a bias toward the data, a reliance on statistics, aninterest in subsets of natural language, and thus a concern with someparticular inventory of sentences of per formance exclusive of any notionof the infinite inventory of sentences of competence.There  are two general directions in which this weakness  is exhib-ited, depending on the size of the natural language subset that is in-3 volved.
With extremely large subsets, data orientation is mainly dueto data inundation, and computer  processing substitutes for theory.Ina  sys tem of this type, it is possible to per fo rm a great deal of com-puter processing without knowing quite what  it all means .
Contentanalysis may  be attempted by statistical techniques, but if the definitionof the statistical word  is not correlated with an actual word  stem--ormore  relexrantly, with a concept  which may be represented  in natura llanguage text  by a number  of d i f fe rent  words  and phrases - - then  al lthat has rea l ly  been per fo rmed is a f requency  count of unique characters t r ings .
The actual  p rocess  of content  ana lys i s  remains  to be per -fo rmed.Another  var ie ty  of data -or ientat ion  weakness  invo lves  ext remelysmal l  subsets  of natura l  language.
In this case ,  the defect  cons is tsin  the test ing  of theor ies  on very  l im i ted  amounts  of data - -o f ten  0nly3In th is  context ,  a la rge  subset ,  is  def ined as the ent i re  in fo rmat ions tore  in a par t i cu la r  sys tem for  p rocess lng- -say ,  sc ient i f i c  mater la l s - -where  the data base  cons is ts  of over  100, 000 documents .14?
on the very  sample  f rom which the theory  was or ig ina l ly  der ived.C la ims  for  the genera l i ty  of techniques  der ived  by such means  mustthus be v iewed with a cer ta in  amount  of skept ic i sm.

Z On the other  hand, there  are  the weaknesses  of the oppos i teperspect ive ,  which is character i zed  by a preoccupat ion  with theory ,counter -examples ,  and the inf inite set  of sentences  of a speakerWscompetence .
The de f i c ienc ies  of this approach  become apparent  incons ider ing  a few passages from Katz, excerpted from a polemicbetween Katz and the philosophers Quine and Wilson.Referring to a paper in which Quine criticizes Carnap's treatmentof analyticity, Katz supports Qulne's criticism of Carnap, stating thatthe Katz-Fodor theory does not require "such ad hoc devices asmeaning postulates and semantic rules" to characterize an analyticsentence but rather defines it as "a sentence whose semanticallyinterpreted underlying phrase marker  (generated by the optimalg rammar  for the language) is such that every semantic marking in4It is  in teres t ing  to note in pass ing  that a s imi la r  c i r t i c i sm hasf requent ly  been leve led  at  t rad i t iona l  l ingu is t i c  descr ip t ions  by l ingu is tsespous ing  the generat ive  approach .
Accord ing  to this c r i t i c i sm,  thedescr ip t ive  l ingu is t  su f fe rs  f rom an exaggerated  ependence  on his"corpus" - - the  body of l ingu is t ic  mater ia l  const i tut ing his data base .I His descr ip t ion  of the language- - in  fo rmal  te rms,  his theory  of thelanguage- - i s  thus a descr ip t ion  of the corpus ,  and its va l id i ty  is afunct ion of the adequacy  of the corpus  as a representat ive  sample  ofthe language.15the read ing  for  i t s  p red icate  a l so  occurs  in the  read ing  fo r  i t s  sub jec t "(Katz ,  1967).
Katz  thus  de f ines  "S is  ana ly t i c  fo r  L "  in  te rms  of theo-re t i ca l  const ruc ts  fo r  wh ich  he c la ims  un iversa l i ty ;  he  fu r ther  s ta testhat  for  each  language,  " fo r  each  L 1 that  i s  a poss ib le  va lue  of  "L" ,i t  i s  poss ib le  to d i f fe rent ia te  the ana ly t i c  f rom the nonana ly t i c  sentencesin L 1 o.u the bas i s  of  p red ic t ions  that  fo l low f rom th i s  de f in i t ion  in  con-ju :c  t;.,,.~ w i th  the  semant ic  descr ip t ions  of the  sentences  in  L 1 p rov idedby  the , .
I rammar  of  L I "  (1968) .UnfortuJ~.ately,  the  impact  of  Kat~s  arguments  i s  substant ia l l yreduced  by  the fac t  that - -a l though there  ex is ts  a de f in i t ion  of  ana ly t i c i tywh ich  has  been  postu la ted  by Katz  in  te rms  of the  theoret i ca l  const ruc ts"under ly ing  phrase  marker ,  " " semant ic  in terpreta t ion ,  " " read ing ,  "" sub jec t  of,  " e tc .

Katzh imse l f  has  a f f i rmed the  necess i ty  of  behav io ra l  tes ts  as  a means  of va l -ida t ing  the  empi r i ca l  adequacy  of  h i s  theoret i ca l  fo rmula t ions  (Katz1967, 1968).
However ,  p rev ious  a t tempts  to invest igate  var ious  syntac -t ic  phenomena through behav io ra l  exper iments  have  not  been  spectacu l -a r ly  success fu l ,  and  s ince  the  invest igat ion  of  semant ic  phenomena16is ines t imab ly  more  complex ,  behav iora l  ver i f i ca t ion  of a g rammarof L 1 appears  imposs ib le .Th is  d i f f i cu l ty  der ives  f rom tw~ sources ,  one of wh ich  invo lvesthe nature  of mean ing ,  and the ~ther ,  the present  s ta te  of knowledgeabout  l ingu is t i c  per fo rmance ,  o r  speech  behav ior .The semant ic  p rob lem l ies  in the fact  that  a great  deal  of mean-ing is s i tuat iona l ly  der ived ;  the phys ica l  and soc i~cu l tura l  s i tuat ion  toa cons iderab le  extent  cont ro l s  the semant ic  in terpretat ion  of sen-tences .
In the nar row sense ,  the c:~neept of a phys ica l  and soc iocu l -tu ra l  context  can  be l im i ted  to those  s i tuat ions  wh ich  are  par t i c ipatedin by a major i ty  of the speakers  of the language:  say ,  a schoo l ,  a c i ty.an a i rpor t .
In the broader  sense ,  however ,  phys ica l  and s~c i :~cu l tura lcontext  inc ludes  such  fac tors  as  the ent i re  h i s to ry  of an in teract ionbetween two persons - - in  o ther  words ,  a l l  the occas ions  on wh ich  theyhave  in teracted  and the content  of those  ins tances  of in teract ion .
With-out  such  in fo rmat ion ,  a n ro~er  in terpretat ion  of innuendoes ,  jokes ,a l lus ions ,  and so fo r th ,  would  not  be poss ib le .
A lso ,  in the sense  ofan in teract ion  between persons ,  the context  is dynamic ;  it g rows  f romthe incept ion  of the in teract ion  to i ts  conc lus ion .Thus ,  the speech  event  is ac tua l ly  per fo rmed in an env i ron-ment  cons is t ing  of the ent i re  range  of phys ica l  and s ~c iocu l tura lphenomena wh ich  are  re levant  to i ts in terpretat ion .
For  th is  reason ,semant ic  in terpretat ion  presents  prob lems of cons iderab le  magn i tude ,some of wh ich  may be inherent ly  inso lub le .17Sett ing the semant ic  p rob lem as ide  fo r  the moment , - .we  cons iderthe second source  of d i f f i cu l ty  encountered  in a t tempt ing  to va l idatea grammar  of L 1 th rough behav iora l  tes t ing :  the present  lack  of anadequate  theory  of per fo rmance ,  or  speech  behav ior .
A grammar  isa m~del  of a speakerVs  innate  capac i ty ,  and not  of the ways  he usesth is  capac i ty  t ~ produce  and unders tand  sentences .
A l though exper i .
-ments  suggest  the psycho log ica l  rea l i ty  of some features  of the s t ruc -tu ra l  descr ip t i ,ns  generated  by the competence  mode l  o r  g rammar(Fodor  and Gar re t t  1967), a speaker  demonst ra tes  h is  competencethr~ughh is  ~er formance ,  and the re la t ion  between a speaker l s  com-petence  and h is  per fo rmance  has  yet to be exp l i ca ted .
Assuming  thata speaker  of L 1 wi l l  p roduce  and unders tand  only  sentences  for  wh ichthe grammar  of L 1 can supp ly  s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ions ,  the prob lem isreduced to determin ing  how the speaker  behaves  in te rms of the s t ruc -tu ra l  descr ip t ion ,  which is not  t r iv ia l  to beg in  with.However ,  re in t roduc ing  the semant ic  p rob lem d iscussed  above,  itis c lear  that  the exp l i ca t ion  of per fo rmance  invo lves  spec i f i ca t ion  of"the speaker J s  behav ior  in compos ing  and in terpret ing  sentences  wi threspect  not only to s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ions ,  but  a l so  to the to ta l  env i r -onment  of the speech  event .
Thus  speakers  can  and do process  sen-tences  wh ich  thegrammar  is not capab le  of generat ing ;  in o ther  words ,the re la t ion  between the sentences  of competence  and those  of per fo rm-ance  is n~t ~ne of s imp le  inc lus ion .
As noted by Kasher  (1967) anddeve loped in deta i l  by Watt  (1968), there  are  cer ta in  features  of thesentences  of per fo rmance  wh ich  cannot  be rep l i ca ted  in a comvetencemode l - - these  inc lude those  wh ich  are  der ived  insome way f rom the18phys ica l  and soc iocu l tura l  s i tuat ion .
An example  of such  a feature  isde le tab i l i ty ;  the sentences  of per fo rmance  are  character i zed  by  de le -t ions  wh ich  are  not recoverab le  f rom the immediate  l ingu is t i c  context .but  must  be supp l ied  f rom the phys ica l  and soc i~cu l tura l  env i ronment .Unfor tunate ly ,  fo rmal  g rammars  tend t ~ be based  on i so la ted  examples~f the per fo rmance  of the l ingu is t i c  invest igator ,  ra ther  than on spon-taneous  sneech .
Th is  p ract i ce  has  the d i sadvantage  of e f fec t ive ly  e l im-inat ing  examples  of speech  wh ich  depend for  the i r  in terpretat ion  on theto ta l  env i ronment  of the speech  ex:ent.
For  ins tance ,  the c rypt i cs ta tement  I ISumber  F ive  once"  is  not myster ious  at a race  t rack ,  wherethe numerous  de le t ions  are  recovered  f rom the env i ronment  (the SZ Winw indow of a thoroughbred  race  t rack)  to prov ide  someth ing  l ike thefo l lowing:(a) '~I wou ld  l ike to wager  two do l la rs  of the f ive do l la rsin my hand that  lhe horse  wh ich  is s ta r t ing  at Pos tPos i t ion  F i r  s wi l l  win the next  race .
,iBecause  the sentences  of per fo rmance  are  la rge ly  context -depend-ent,  and because  there  is as  yet no exp l i ca t ion  of how speakers  behavein te rms of s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ions - - le t  a lone  in terms of the tota l  en -v i ronment  of the speech  event ,  it is  apparent  that  the major i ty  of sen-tences  produced by speakers  of L 1 cou ld  not be generated  by the gram-r~ar  of L 1.
Thus ,  a g rammar  of L l - -assuming  the ex is tence  of such- -cou ld  not  be va l idated  by behav iora l  tes ts ,  and there  wou ld  be essen-It ia l l y  no way  of re la t ing  the sentences  ac tua l ly  per fo rmed by speakersof L 1 to th )se  spec i f ied  by the grammar .
It is  there fore  approur ia teto inqu i re  what  such  a grammar  might  be good fo r .19F rom the data -or iented  point of v iew it is c lear ly  inadequate ,  becauseit does  not dea l  with the sentences  ac tua l ly  p roduced  by speakers  of thelanguage;  f rom the theory -or iented  point  of v iew it is a l so  unsat i s fac tory ,s ince  it is incomplete .
Yet, because  of the improbab i l i ty  of exp l i ca t ingthe tota l  env i ronment  {as def ined above} of the speech  event ,  there  isl i t t le  hope that  a complete  semant ic  theory  wi l l  ever  be deve loped,  andful l  unders tand ing  of how a speaker  uses  the competence  wh ich  the gram-mar  represents  is not l ike ly  to be acqu i red  in the fo reseeab le  fu ture .
Itthere fore  seems wor thwh i le  to cons ider  some concepts  and s t ra teg ieswhich might  serve  as  work ing  hypotheses  and prov ide  at leas t  an interir~.so lut ion  to p rob lems of the theor ies  of mean ing  and speech  behav io r .Z.
3 One concept  which might  p rove  use fu l  in th is  re  gard  is  that  of"semant ic  equ iva lence" .
Return ing  to the context -dependent  example  ofrace  t rack  par lance  presented  above,  it is c lear  that g iven  the phys ica lenv i ronment  of the t rack ,  pas t  exper ience  in that  env i ronment ,  and  o therre levant  soc iocu l tu ra l  phenomena,  the speaker  of Amer ican  Eng l i shaccepts  "Number  F ive  once"  as  in some way equ iva lent  o the exp l ic i tp ropos i t i ,n  p resented  in {a}.
The two examples  be long to a se t  of sen-tences  which might  be descr ibed  as "semant ica l l y  equ iva lent  per fo r -mances"  for the purposes  of th is  p resentat ion .
These  sentences  a rethus  def ined on the assumpt ion  that  speakers  of Amer ican  Eng l i shwould judge them to funct ion  as semant ic  equ iva lents  in the appropr ia teenv i ronment  {provlded that  the speakers  were  knowledgeab le  about  thepar t i cu la r  env i ronment ,  e i ther  v i car ious ly  or th rough persona l  exper i -20ence .
Some add i t iona l  members  of the  sample  set  a re  as  fo l lows :" I  want  to bet  two do l la rs  on Number  F ive .
t'" I  want  Number  F ive  once .
""G ive  me a two do l la r  bet  on the Number  F ive  horse .
""Put  two bucks  on F ive .
""Two on Number  F ive .
v0Note  that  some of these  sentences  wou ld  be judged syntact i ca l l y  dev-iant  by  speakers  whose  exper ience  does  not inc lude  par t i c ipat ion  in  themi l ieu  of a race  t rack .
Moreover ,  the  major i ty  of the sentences  wou ldbe judged semant ica l ly  dev iant  in a non-bet t ing  env i ronment .
Thosesentences  wh ich  wou ld  be judged semant ica l ly  appropr ia te  in o ther  en -v i ronments ,  however ,  der ive  the i r  appropr ia teness  not  f rom member -sh ip  in  the  set  p resented  above ,  but  f rom membersh ip  in  some otherequ iva lence  set  wh ich  is  semant ica l ly  appropr ia te  for  the g iven  en-v i ronment .
For  example ,  "Two on Number  F ive"  might  a l so  be usedin an  a i rpor t ;  but  in  th i s  case ,  i t  wou ld  be long  to an  equ iva lence  set  in -c lud ing  the fo l low ing  sentences ,  among others :" I  want  two seats  on F l ight  Number  F ive ,  wh ich  leavesGreat  Fa l l s  a t  6:05 a .m.
and  ar r ives  in  Sa l t  Lake  C i tya t  8:49 a.  m.  ""G ive  me two t i ckets  on the  f l ight  that  leaves  here  at6:05 a .m.""
I  want  two seats  on Number  F ive  to Sa l t  Lake  C i ty .
~u"Two t i ckets  on the next  f l ight  to Sa l t ' Lake  C i ty ,  p lease .
'~In cons ider ing  the  not ion  of equ iva lence  set  as  a poss ib le  work inghypothes is ,  a few operat ing  d i f f i cu l t ies  shou ld  be noted .
One such21di f f iculty l ies in expl icat ing the def in iens or  bas ic  member  of the set ,s ince it must  include al l  the re levant  features  of the phys ica l  andsoc iocu l tu ra l  env i ronment .
A second prob lem cons is ts  in def in ing ap-p ropr ia te  equiva lence sets  for more  abst rac t  contexts ,  where  thenotion of equiva lence is more  di f f icult  to spec i fy  than in the examplespresented  above.However ,  this not ion - -wh ich  def ines  sets  of ins tances  of behav iorin te rms of the i r  funct ion as semant ic  equiva lents  in par t i cu la r  phy-s i ca l  and soc iocu l tu ra l  env i ronments - - i s  usefu l  for  two reasons .
Inthe f i r s t  p lace,  it p rov ides  a means  for  deal ing sys temat ica l ly  withthe e lus ive  concepts  of speech  behav ior  and s i tuat iona l ly  der ivedmean ing .
Secondly,  the notion of an equ iva lence set  p rov ides  anapprox imate  def in i t ion of a re lat ions in the sense  of symbo l i c  logicjand is thus a means  of approach ing  a fo rmal i sm in an induct ive way.The d i f f icu l t ies  which inhere  in the expl icat ion of meaning  and ofspeech  behav ior  make it ra ther  unl ikely that such theor ies  wi l l  spr ingful ly deve loped f rom the brow of some l ingu is t ic ian.
There fore ,  ifcomplete  expl icat ion of meaning and speech  behav ior  is poss ib le  atall j  it would seem more  l ikely to be ach ieved by work ing f rom the ex-p l ic i t  to the inexpl ic i t  than converse ly .Accord ing ly ,  i t  is suggested  that  a reasonab le  approach  to prob lemsof the theor ies  of meaning  and of speech  behav ior  would be the const ruc -t ion of an exper imenta l  mode l  for  ana lys i s  of natura l  language in te rmsof se ts  of semant ica l ly  equivalent  per fo rmances  as def ined above.
Thein i t ia l  mode l  would be deve loped f rom a data base  cons is t ing  of sentences22per fo rmed in a par t i cu la r  phys ica l  and soc iocu l tura l  env i ronment ,  andwou ld  thus  represent  a res t r i c ted  subset  of the natura l  language.
Theenv i ronment  se lec ted  for  the or ig ina l  mode l  might  be a race  t rack ,  ana i rpor t ,  a market ,  or  some other  type of s t ruc tured  s i tuat ion ,  in o rderto reduce  prob lems of def in ing  semant ica l ly  equ iva lent  se ts  of sentences .Success ive  vers ions  of the mode l  wou ld  be capab le  of p rocess ing  mater -ia l s  of inc reas ing  complex i ty  w i th  respect  to contextua l  var iab les - -e ,  g.the var ious  subsets  of "present -day  Amer ican  Eng l i sh"  represented  inKu~era  and F ranc is  {1967).Assuming  a res t r i c ted  automat ic  thesaurus  and a data  base  in mach ine-readab le  fo rm,  a f i r s t  cut  at equ iva lence  sets  could  be prov ided  by separ -ate l i s t s{sor ted in terna l ly  by number  of thesaurus  group  ass ignments )  ofsentences  conta in ing  words  or  phrases  f rom the same thesaurus  groups ,and words  and phrases  f rom the  same group  as  we l l  as  more  genera l  o rmore  spec i f i c  g roups .
These  l i s t s  could  then be s tud ied  in deta i l  toi so la te  potent ia l  equ iva lence  sets .
The e lements  of the bas ic  member  o rde f in iens  of each set  would  be ident i f ied  in the course  of th is  s tudy,  andthe set  membersh ip  va l idated  by behav iora l  tes ts ,  wh ich  wou ld  a l so  serveas  a means  of e l i c i t ing  add i t i~aa l  members  of the set  not represented  inthe data  base .The f ina l  s tep  in const ruct ion  of the mode l  cons is ts  in represent -ing the de f in iens  in the notat ion  of fo rmal  log ic ,  and represent ing  theo ther  members  of the set  in te rms of the de f in iens .
Ana lys i s  of a sen-tence  presented  to the mode l  is thus  accompl i shed  through a dec is ionprocedure  for  membersh ip  in a par t i cu la r  equ iva lence  set ,  by assoc ia t ionZ3with a par t i cu la r  de f in iens  or i ts  converse .3 .0  The proposed  mode l  is p resented  as  an approx imate  so lu t ionto p rob lems of theory  and data o r ienta t ion .
It overcomes  the respec -t ive weaknesses  of the two approaches  ( see  Sect ions  Z.
