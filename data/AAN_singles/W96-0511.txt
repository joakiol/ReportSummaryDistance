IntroductionThere are two major types of languagegeneration.l The first of these is monologuegeneration, which focuses on generating mon-ologue text, typically of paragraph length.The second is dialogue generation, the aim ofwhich is to produce co-operative, interactivediscourse.
Typically projects in natural ang-uage generation focus on one or the other, butsome researchers are now considering how thetwo fit together.
This paper is one of a seriesthat discuss how this may.
be done, at thesecond stage of generation, i.e.
the generationof the structure of discourse.The most influential approach to planningdiscourse monologues in recent years hasundoubtedly been Rhetorical Structure Theory(RST).
While there is much to discuss aboutthis framework, for our present purposes weshall adopt and accept he 'standard version, asfound in Mann and Thompson (1987) and themany papers that build on it.
For dialogue weuse what we take to be the most holistic andmost explicit development of the BirminghamSchool of discourse analysis (originating withSinclair and Coulthard 1975), namely theSystemic Flowchart Model (SFM).
This wasfirst described in Fawcett, van der Mije and vanWissen (1988).The present paper follows on from twoearlier papers in particular.
The first describesthe implementation f the SFM as part of theCOMMUNAL Project (Lin, Fawcett and Davies1993).2 The second is Fawcett and Davies'~rogrammatic paper (1993), which describesow an integration of RST and the SFM mightbe attempted, The purpose of the presentpaper is to give an account of animplementation of the point where the twomodels are integrated - including a new systemnetwork through which this is achieved.
Wesee no reason why other contributions thatdraw on a broadly systemic functionalapproach to modelling RST relations, such asVander Linden, Cumming and Martin (1993)and Maier and Hovy (1993), may not beintegrated with the present proposals.2.
Some problems in relating RST to the SFMFawcett and Davies (1993) provide summ-ary descriptions of the two approaches, o weshall not replicate those descriptions here.
Thatpaper also discuases some of the possibledifficulties in integrating the SFM and RST.Fawcett and Davies concluded:We do not expect a 'seamless join' betweenthe two models to occur effortlessly; there arebound to be difficulties of many kinds as weexplore possible ways of bringing the twomodels together.
But, given the richness andflexibility of the descriptive and implement-ational tools available to us, it is an enter-prise on which we can enter with an expect-ation of some measure of success.Here we shall report both the way in which wehave successfully modelled the point in theoverall discourse grammar at which RST andthe SFM meet, and the surprising ease withwhich we were able to do it.For the Birmingham School of DiscourseAnalysis, a dialogue consists of a series oftransactions, each of which is made up of anumber of exchanges.
These in turn haveconstituents called moves, and each move con-sists of one or more acts.
Thus their modelassumes that there is a rank scale relationshipbetween these units (Halliday 196l).
Thisconcept is found in the SFM too.In RST, on the other hand, there is the pot-ential for the unlimited recursion of structuresconsisting of a nucleus with a satellite in therelation of elaboration or reason, etc.
In theintegration of the two to be described here wemodel this as the recursion of acts within acts.The SFM model of discourse structure isboth richer and at the same time more trad-itional than the types of structure built in RST.The main difference in 'richness' is that eachnode is labelled twice.
It is shown as both anelement of structure in the unit above, and bythe name of the unit that fills it.
Thus theconcepts of 'nucleus' and 'satellite' are treatedhere as elements of structure.
The SFM ismore traditional in that its structure is based on'constituency' rather than the concept of 'sisterdependency', as in RST.
This provides a richerand so more informative labelling, with therhetorical relation shown as the class of act.3 A typical structureWe will now look at a typical example ofthe sort of structure that occurs at the pointwhere the rank-based structure of the SFMmeets the potential recursion of RST relations- using for both a 'constituency' approach thathas at each node both elements and units.41Ivy/Rmove: give_informationN Sact: inform act: elaborationN S N Sact: act: act: act:inform background inform reasonI II II II II went to He'd agreed to It took us as we dis-see Fred.

time, several points.Figure 1: A fragment of a discourse structureat the point where RST and the SFM meetHow is this structure generated?
To see this,we must look at the new system network shownin Figure 2 - and also at Its associated realiz-ation rules, because it is through these that thechosen features are converted into structures.4 How the structure is generatedThe discourse generator that we are aboutto describe is called GENEDIS, because itGENErates DIScourse (For details see Lin etal.
1993.)
Many of its choices are guided bythe goals set in the higher planningcomponent,  but much of the 'discoursepotential' is captured here.
As it enters thenetwork in Figure 2, it knows that it has thegoal of filling the Respond element (hence 'R')of an exchange, and that it is to be uttered byIvy (i.e.
the system).
The network operates inthe following manner.
We enter it at \[discourseunit\], and find that the probabilities in theinitial system are set 100% to \[move\].
(On(re-entry to the network to fill out the lowerpart of the tree, however, this choice will bereversed.)
As you will see if you look at therealization rules, the selection of \[move\] insertsfirst the unit 'move' into the structure, and thenlocates the element nucleus (N) at Place 2 inthat move's structure.
(We shall shortly seewhy it is at Place 2 rather than Place l.)We now encounter two 'simultaneous'stems.
In the MOVE CLASS system,NEDIS typically choos~-s one of the fivemajor classes of move.
The realization rule oneach of these inserts this into the structure (therelationship of 'class' being shown by a colon).Notice that the categories that get inserted intothe growinu structure may have similar or evenidentical abels to the features in the network.In principle the two are separate, but there islittle point in multiplying terms unnecessarily.In the lower system, i.e.
MOVE_COM-PLEXITY, our choice is \[with_satellite_m\].
(Lack of space prevents us from describing theeffects of choosing \ [s implem\]  or \[co_ordin-a tedm\] ,  but the rules given cover the former.
)However the typical choice - and the mostinteresting one - is \[with satellite m\].
Thechoice of this feature a f f~ts  the structure infour ways.
First, its realization rule (0.4)rovides for re-entry to the network to fill N.is this fact that provides for the recursiontypical of RST relations in the presentframework, as we shall shortly see.But this feature also leads on to two furthersimultaneous systems: one for RHETORICALRELATIONS and a second for SATELLITETHEMATIZATION.
We will take the latterfirst.
The concept of 'thematizing' an elementin the structure of a unit comes from systemicfunctional grammar, where it is mainly assoc-iated with the clause.
We use the same termhere because the motivation is similar in both.Typically, the satellite follows the nucleus,but the different types of rhetorical relationhave different typicalpatterns in this respect.So how does GENEDIS know which tochoose?
The answer lies in the upper system,and the entry to this is the third effect ofchoosing \[with_satel l i tem\].
As you will see,the features here are precisely those of therhetorical relations of RST.
But notice thatthese features have attached to them same pass(sp) preference resetting rules (i.e.
these rulesare not realization rules).
It is these thatexpress the likelihood that the satellite willprecede or follow the nucleus - as the sp rulesbelow the network show.
One advantage ofusing probabilities on features in systems isthat they can be varied, e.g.
for different ypesof genre {cp.
the.
prevalence of thematized'purposes' m certain types of instructions).
Insome cases the probabilities are absolute, as inour case, where the sp rule on \[elaboration\]makes it 100% certain that the S will follow.In any given instance, of course, the Performermay have a reason to thematize a satellite thatoverrides the probabilities, but in a sophisticat-ed model he/she should be able to set thisagainst the knowledge of the general probab-iffties for a ,ziven type of rhetorical relation.The finaVeffect of selecting \[withsatel l i te_m\] is to provide that the network will be re-entered to fill S, as in Rules 0.5 and 0.51.We have now generated all of the structureof the move.
This part of the network is non-recursive, but as we now re-enter the networkto generate the acts that will fill the N and S ofthe move, we meet a recursive system network.The recursion is modelled through the realiz-ation rules; a new layer of structure is addedby each re-entry to the network.
And the pot-ential for recurslon is, in principle, infinite.On re-entry to the network to fill N, thepreferences have been reset to \[act\] and\[nucleus _act\].
Similarly, on re-entry to fill Sthey are reset to \[act!
and \[satellite_act\].
Rule0.7 inserts the unit act' in both cases.
Theclass of act to fill N comes from the networktor ACT_CLASS, and in our case Rule 0.8inserts 'inform' after 'act'.
It is Rule 0.71 on\[satellite act\] that determines what the class efthe act filling S will be.

O t Finally, it leads on to choices m themauzm_the S, and to the realization rules that proviffefor re-entry - like those for the S in a move.Thus the network and realization rulestogether provide for the recursive embeddingof acts with further acts at either N or S or atboth, In, this way,,then, we do indeed movevirtually seamlessly from the SFM structure toRST relations.5.
ConclusionsThe generation of the discourse structure ofmonologues and dialogues are usually treatedas separate research paradigms, but in thispaper we have shown how the gap between thetwo can be bridged.
As we have seen, RSTrelations can be fully integrated with the richerSFM framework by restating the 'sister-dep-endency' relations of RST as occurring viatheir mother unit, i.e.
in an 'element and unit'model.
In this way we have arrived at auni f ied f ramework  for generat ing bothdialogues and monologues.How was this integration accomplished sorelatively easily?
The answer seems to be thatGENEDIS,  which is itself adapted from thesentence generator GENESYS,  provides anappropriately rich and relevant array of o.per-ators.
It can therefore be extended, m aprincipled manner, to incorporate the simplerset of relations of RST.
This suggests in turnthe value of the particular set of conceptsincorporated into the Cardiff Grammar, and ofthe grammar-writing tool DEFREL, in whichboth GENESYS and GENEDIS are written.Essentially, we have here incorporated RSTwithin the SFM rather than the other wayabout.
There is a good reason for this.
It isthat dialogues regularly contain monologues,but,monologues (w, hile they can be interruptedby mini-dialogues to clear up misunderstand-ings and to challenge, etc.)
occur - eitherexplicitly or implicitly - within a dialogue.The fundamental principle underlying alldiscourse generation is that there is always anAddressee - so that there is always at least animplicit potential for dialogue.ReferencesDale, R., Hovy, E.H., Roesner, D., and Stock, 0.,(eds.)

We also wish to thank the anonymousreviewers of this paper, whose comments, advice andqueries have led to a complete re-writing of it.
Wethink that the result is a clearer presentation of theideas.2.
COMMUNAL stands for COnvivial Man-Machine Understanding through NAtural Language,and it is a long-term project in building a system forcommunication with computers that draws onsystemic functional linguistics (supplemented byother concepts when they are found useful).
At ~tsheart lies the GENESYS sentence generator, so calledbecause it GENErates SYStemically, i.e.
using asystemic functional grammar (SFG).
A completerevision of the earlier version is now being developed,incorporating many new concepts.
For what is,surprisingly, the only complete published account ofhow a SFG generates a sentence, see Fawcett, Tuckerand Lin (1993).
The lexicogrammar used inGENESYS - -  and also for work in textualdescription - -  is increasingly being referred to as 'theCardiff Grammar'.
