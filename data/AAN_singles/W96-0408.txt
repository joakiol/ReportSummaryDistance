Considering the Effects ofSecond Language Learning on GenerationKathleen F. McCoy, Christopher A. PenpingtonComputer and Information Sciences DepartlnentApplied Science and Engineering LaboratoriesUniversity of Delaware / A.I.duPont InstituteNewark, DE 19716mccoy@cis.udel.edu, penningt@ asel.udel.eduAbstractIn this paper we discuss how generation issuesaffect the design of a computer-assisted languagelearning tool designed to teach written English asa second language to deaf users of American SignLanguage.
We discuss a dual-component linguis-tic model that attempts to reflect the generationprocess of the learners.
The first model compo-nent captures the influence of the first language onthe acquisition of the second.
The second modelcomponent captures the process of second lan-guage acquisition itself.The linguistic model helps the system identifyerrors along with their probable source(s).
Thisinformation is crucial for effective correction.
It isalso useful in the response phase of the system tofocus tutoring on the errors that are most benefi-cial to correct.
In addition, the linguistic modelcan be used to tailor the system's realization of itsresponse.
In this way, the syntactic onstructionsgenerated by the system will provide understand-able and positive exemplars of the language fea-tures currently being acquired by the leamer.Keywordstailoring response generation, user modeling,computer-assisted language learning1 IntroductionOur long-term goal is to develop a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) tool to helpdeaf students leam written English.
The targetedstudents are users of American Sign Language(ASL), a language that is very different fromEnglish in its structure and discourse strategies.The approach we take is to view the student'sleaming of written English as a task in secondLinda Z.

In this respect, our effort issimilar to other projects geared toward learning(English as) a second language.We envision a system that would be used by a par-Ocular student over an extended period of time.
Astudent would use the system as a tutor, enteringtexts (perhaps of several paragraphs in length)that he/she has written.
The system would analyzethese texts for errors, engage the student in a cor-rective tutorial dialogue, and offer possible cor-rected versions for some of the original inputsentences.To accomplish these goals, the proposed systemmust have several components.
First, it must havethe ability to analyze texts that are input by thestudent and determine what/where rrors occur.Once the errors have been identified, the systemmust decide which of these errors it should con-centrate on in its response to the student.
Finally,the system must have the ability to generateappropriate corrective tutorial messages.While at first glance, one might think that prob-lems of Natural Language Generation only occurin the last phase of the system processing, webelieve that a "generation" perspective on theentire process is extremely beneficial.
For exam-ple, the problem of identifying errors in the origi-nal input text may seem like an issue of straightanalysis, but it is not completely so.
While anerror might be recognized oing a syntactic parseof the sentence, in order for beneficial correction,both the specific error and its probable sourceshould be identified.Consider the following simple example: "Mybrother like to go...".
It is clear that there is aproblem in subject-verb agreement; however,does it occur because (1) the noun should be inthe plural form, (2) the verb should be in singular71form, or (3) the student doesn't know that suchagreement exists in the language?
Depending onthe reason for the.mistake, different kinds of tuto-rial correction will likely be more helpful.
Ourbelief is that in order to identify probable sourcesof errors, the developer must take into account hestudent's generation process.
In other words, theeventual system must possess an understanding ofwhat is causing the student o generate sentencesthat contain these mistakes.In this paper we present aportion of our work thatdescribes the student's generation process as it isaffected by second language acquisition (SLA).Our linguistic model of the student's generationprocess essentially reflects those aspects of thesecond language that are currently being leamed.This also has implications on the system's genera-tion process.
In particular we discuss two ways inwhich the system's responses can be tailored tothe user.
In deciding "what to say", the system'sgeneration can be tailored to focus on those errorsthat involve language features that the student isin the process of acquiring.
In deciding "how tosay it", the system can attempt o use the con-structions that are currently being leamed (as wellas those that have been mastered) and so providethe student with correct exemplars of the secondlanguage.
This is particularly important for thetutor we are developing since a lack of under-standable input / feedback is a serious problem forthe deaf community.After giving an overview of our project, we con-centrate on how the student's generation processis represented in our system.
We have developed amodel of how the effects of the first language (inour case, ASL) can be accounted for in the analy-sis phase of our system, and are currently devel-oping a model which captures the effects oflanguage acquisition itself.
We discuss how thesemodels affect the system's decisions of both whatto say (i.e., what errors to tutor the student about)and how to say it (i.e., what syntactic onstruc-tions to use in the realization of the system's mes-sage).2 A Writing Tool for DeafStudents: ICICLEThe problem of low literacy skills among deafpeople has been well-documented and affects ev-ery aspect of deaf students' education.
Since dataon writing skills is not well documented, we notethat the reading comprehension level of deaf stu-dents is considerably ower than that of their hear-ing counterparts, "... with about half of thepopulation of deaf 18-year-olds reading at or be-low a fourth grade level and only about 10% read-ing above the eighth grade level..." \[Str88\].
Wehave undertaken a project designed to act as a"writing tutor" for deaf ASL signers learning writ-ten English.
The eventual system will analyze atext written by a student, identify errors in the text,and engage the student in a tutorial dialogue aimedat some subset of the errors identified. r....._ I ERRORI MAL-RULES \[/ YMODEL MODEL \[~ USERMODELRESPONSE GENERATORFigure 1 ICICLE Overall System DesignFigure 1 contains a block diagram of the overallsystem under development.
The system, calledICICLE (Interactive Computer Identification andCorrection of Language Errors), is designed to bea general purpose language learning tutor, how-ever, we have focused on its application to deafusers of ASL acquiring written English, essen-tially as a second language.In the ICICLE system, the input/feedback yclebegins when the student enters a portion of textinto the computer.
The student's text is first pro-cessed by the Error Identification componentwhich is responsible for tagging all errors found ina given input.
The possible ffects of the student'sfirst language on generated sentences i represent-ed by the Language Model in Figure 1.
Our meth-odology for developing this knowledge source isdescribed in the next section.
At present, ErrorIdentification analyzes only one input sentence ata time.
It first does a syntactic parse of the sentenceusing an English grammar augmented with errorproduction rules called mal-rules \[S1e82\],\[WVJ78\].
The mal-rules expand the coverage ofthe grammar to include the errors that might be ex-pected from people acquiring written English as a72second language.
Thus these mal-rules capture x-pected language generation pattems from this pop-ulation.
Support for mal-rules will be developedwithin the framework of a probabilistic ontext-free grammar mechanism \[Cha93\], \[A1195\].
1After using the expanded grammar to produce oneor more syntactic parses of the input, the systemselects a single parse using a scoring mechanism\[MPS96\] that takes into account a model of theacquisition process (labeled Acquisition Model inFigure 1 and further described in Section 4).
Oncea single parse is chosen, the errors are identifiedbased on annotations associated with the real-rules.
If syntactic mal-rules were used in theparse, the sentence and any relevant annotationswill be passed to the Response Generator.
TheError Identification component may also containsemantic rules and discourse information thatcould add annotations for the Response Genera-tor, though these are beyond the scope of thispaper.Now the Response Generator will take this infor-mation, along with data from the User Model(only a portion of which is described in thispaper), and decide which errors to correct indetail and how each should be corrected.
2 Thisprocess includes determining which syntacticconstructions hould be preferred in the actualrealization of the response.
The Response Gener-ator must also select an appropriate instructionalstrategy from the Tutoring Module.Finally, the system's responses are presented tothe student who then has an opportunity to entercorrections to the text and have it re-checked.During the system processing, information aboutthe student's language usage over time (as well asuser/system interactions) can be tracked andupdated through the History Module.While the overall system and its design encom-pass many important generation questions, wewill focus on issues involving the LanguageModel and the Acquisition Model.
We argue thatthese two models can be used to "explain" the stu-dent's sentence generation capabilities and shouldaffect the system's response generation as well.1.
The current implementation of this phase does not yetinclude probabilistic information.2.
While in theory, instruction in ASL would be useful, thegeneration of ASL is well beyond the scope of thiswork.3 Capturing the Effects of theFirst LanguageA major proposal of our work is that a model in-corporating possible effects of the first languageshould be included in the component that is re-sponsible for identifying errors in the productionof a second language.
Such a model should indi-cate situations where the first language can haveeither a positive or negative influence.
This claimis made based on an analysis of writing samples 3collected from a number of schools and organiza-tions for the deaf, concentrating on proficient ASLsigners.
4See \[Sur93\] for a complete discussion ofthis analysis as well as a detailed taxonomy ofcommon language rrors that were found.During our error analysis, we were constantlysearching for why the errors we found were occur-ring.
Knowing the underlying reason for a mistakeis crucial to the goal of providing effective tutor-ing.
Our analysis and intuitions led us to the notionof language transfer to explain many of the errorswe were finding.
The term "language transfer"generally refers to the influence that knowledge ofone language (LI) has on the production and/orcomprehension f a second language (L2).
Trans-fer can be positive (in the sense that it may speedthe acquisition of the L2); however, it may also re-sult in deviations in L2 production in places wherethe L1 and the L2 differ.
While the existence oflanguage transfer has been a rather controversialsubject over the years (see \[McL87\], \[GS83\],\[Sur91\]), much recent research as provided con-vincing evidence that LT indeed occurs (see\[McL87\], \[Gas84\], [GS83\]).Given that transfer has been documented betweenspoken languages, it is reasonable to ask whetheror not language transfer could occur betweenASL (a visual-gestural language) and writtenEnglish.
At first glance, transfer may seem sur-3.4.Other researchers (e.g., \[PQ731, \[QWM761, \[RQP76\],\[QPS77\], \[KK78\], \[QP841) studied errors in deaf writ-ing.
Our work differs in that we attribute many errors tolanguage transfer (LT) between ASL and writtenEnglish as is explained below.We would like to thank John Albertini of the NationalTechnical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), Bob McDonaldof Gallaudet University, Lore Rosenthal of the Pennsyl-vania School for the Deaf, George Schellum (formerly)of the Margaret S. Sterck School, and MJ Bienvenu ofthe Bicultural Center for helping us gather writing sam-ples.73prising since the components of ASL grammarand written English grammar are very different\[Sto60\], \[BP78\], \[Pad82\], \[HS83\], \[KB79\],\[BPB83\].
ASL grammar components include signorder, morphological modulations of signs, andnon-manual behavior that occurs simultaneouslywith the manual signs \[BC80\], \[Lid80\], \[Pad81 \],\[KG83\], ling78\], \[Bak80\].
Written English gram-mar components include word order, morphologi-cal modulations of words, and punctuation, butnothing that clearly corresponds to the simulta-neous manual/non-manual behavior found inASL.
On the surface, the fact that ASL and writ-ten English occur in different modalities eemsproblematic as well.
However, there is some evi-dence that ASL is processed similarly to spokenlanguages (e.g., \[Sac90\]).3.1 Characterizing LanguageTransferBecause of the differences in grammar and modal-ity between ASL and English, we have attemptedto abstractly characterize how languages coulddiffer in a way that is independent of the grammarcomponents.
By looking at language on a featureby feature basis, we have identified several an-guage mis-matches that may lead to (negative)transfer.First, languages may differ in when they mark aparticular feature.
As a result the marking of thatfeature in the L2 may seem redundant in the firstlanguage.
For example, in ASL it is usual toestablish tense at the beginning of a discoursesegment or time frame, and then not to mark itagain until the time frame changes.
Of course, inEnglish, tense is marked (on the verb) in everyfinite clause; so, some tense markings in Englishmay seem redundant to an ASL signer.
Transferof such a feature (i.e., when to mark tense) mightexplain omission errors (in this case, of tensemarkings) in the L2.
In fact, sentences containingthese types of  errors were common in our sam-ples.
Consider the following:?
"We went to see Senator Biden's office... Thenwe go to see the Vietnam memorial...."This example is a particularly good illustration ofa difficulty due to a question of when to marktense, since the writer clearly knows how to formthe past tense of "go" (because the appropriatepast tense form appears in the sample).Second, languages may differ in how they mark afeature.
That is, two languages may express aconcept in radically different ways and thus themapping between the languages may be unclear.To illustrate this, consider the realization of theverb "to be" in ASL and English.
Of course, "tobe" is a standard verb in English.
In ASL, how-ever.
"to be" is not lexicalized using a standardsign.
Instead it is conveyed implicitly in a topic-comment structure .5For example, according to anASL informant, to say "The shirt is red", thesigner would typically sign SHIRT and mark it asa topic by raising his/her eyebrows, tilting his/herhead and maintaining fairly constant eye gaze onthe addressee, and then sign RED, with a differenthead position, brow position and gaze.Because of this vastly different method of realiza-tion, we might expect and often do find problemsin sentences involving a main verb of "to be".Difficulties include both dropping the verb andconfusing "have" and "be" as main verbs.
6Theseerrors are exemplified by the following:?
"Once the situation changes they _ differentpeople."?
"... some birth controls are side-effect."
(Possi-ble Correction: "... have side-effects...")A third way languages may differ is in regard torequiring morphological changes or additionallexical items for strictly syntactic reasons.
Forexample, English requires a subject-verb agree-ment marking ("+s") on most verbs in the presenttense when the subject is third-person-singular.This morphological marking often conveys noextra information.
The situation of subject-verbagreement is more complex in ASL.
When sub-ject-verb agreement is marked in ASL, it involves5.
In a topic-comment s ructure, the topic is signed first,and then the comment is signed, grammatical signalsmarking the topic and comment.
The grammatical mark-ings for topichood involve raising the eyebrows, tiltingthe head, and maintaining fairly constant eye gaze on theaddressee (unless directional gaze is needed for othergrammatical purposes).
The final sign of the topic is alsoheld slightly longer than usual.
When the comment issigned, the head position, brows and gaze change.
"Howthey change depends on the type of comment that fol-lows (e.g.
\[sic\] statement, 'yes-no' question, com-mand)."
(p. 157) \[BC8016.
Because both having and being are expressed throughthe same grammatical structure in ASL, language trans-fer could explain why some ASL singers sometimescon~se the use of the verbs "be" and "have" in English.74a much different marking than what Englishrequires.
Also, the ASL marking is (generally) notempty of informational content.
This couldexplain omissions of the morphological marking("+s") on these verbs in the written English ofproficient ASL signers.
Consider the sentence:?
"My brother like to go..."A final area of language transfer occurs when onelanguage (say L1) has two or more words orphrases which co~espond to a single word/phrasein the other language, and vice versa.
For exam-ple, ASL uses the same sign (i.e., lexical item) for"other" and "another".
Thus, language transfermight explain why an ASL learner of writtenEnglish may have difficulty leaming which word("other" or "another") is appropriate to use inEnglish.3.2 Developing the Language ModelTo summarize, part of our model of the learner'sgeneration process includes a Language Modelwhich captures the influence of the first languageon the production of the second language.
Ourwork in this area has included an analysis of writ-ing samples from deaf writers who are proficientin ASL.
The analysis upports the hypothesis thatthese people are using the natural and beneficialstrategy of building on their ASL knowledgewhen acquiring English.
Our findings also revealthat many of the error classes (perhaps as many as76% of those found in our initial sample analysis)could be attributed to language transfer from ASLto English (if language transfer is defined in theway that we sugges0.
However, we do not claimthat every instance of an error class that could beexplained by language transfer must be.
There areother factors at work as well.What we do propose is that a Language Modelthat accounts for possible effects of the LI on theL2 should be developed by comparing the twolanguages on a feature by feature basis.
When anyof the four mismatches we have described occur,mal-rules that encode the conflicting realizationsshould be included in the Language Model.
Thus,the resulting model will contain annotated mal-rules that capture the errors we expect from sec-ond language learners.
Presumably this modelshould capture the generation process of a learnerwho is using a model of their first language as abasis for generating in the second.4 Taking the L2 AcquisitionProcess into AccountSo far our description of the learner's generationprocess takes only the first language into account.If the system contained only this model, then itwould predict hat the student would make all mis-takes invited by language transfer at every possi-bility.
In fact, the set of errors a given studentmakes may be influenced by the L 1, but that setchanges over time as the L2 is acquired.
A studentstops making some errors and begins making oth-ers.
At the same time the set of errors a studentmakes changes, so too does the set of construc-tions a student uses (appropriately).
For example,generally a beginning student does not attempt touse a sentence that contains a complex sententialcompLment or a relative clause, until after he/shehas mastered the use of simple subject-verb-objectsentences.
In this section we introduce a compo-nent which attempts to capture aspects of the sec-ond language acquisition process that affect thetext the student is generating.In acquiring English as a second language, thereis considerable linguistic evidence that the acqui-sition order of English features is relatively con-sistent and fixed regardless of the first languageling89\], \[DB74\], \[BMK74\].
In fact, a strongerversion of this statement (i.e., that the languageacquisition order is always fixed), is one of thecentral tenets of universal grammar theory (seefor example, \[Haw91\] and \[KH87\]).
While ourbelief is that for specific individuals this orderingmay be influenced by some factors (such as theinstructional situation or significant ransfer fromL1), these basic findings should play an importantrole in a model of second language acquisition.A second area of research which may also shedsome light on the acquisition process encom-passes research in language assessment and edu-cational grade expectations (e.g., \[Ber88\],\[Lee74\], \[Cry82\]).
This body of research outlinessets of syntactic onstructions (language features)that students are generally expected to master by acertain point in time.
This work can be interpretedas specifying groups of features that should beacquired at roughly the same time.
For example,one would expect that the group of features thatdiffer between a first and second grade readinglevel should be acquired together (i.e., betweenfirst and second grade).75We have attempted to account for the precedingresults in a language assessment model calledSLALOM ("Steps of Language Acquisition in aLayered Organization Model").
The basic ideabehind SLALOM is to divide the English lan-guage (the L2 in our case) into a set of featurehierarchies (e.g., morphology, types of nounphrases, types of relative clauses).
Within any sin-gle hierarchy, the features are ordered accordingto their "difficulty" of acquisition, reflecting theirrelative linguistic complexity.
The orderingwithin feature hierarchies has been the subject ofinvestigation in work such as \[Ing89\], \[DB74\],and \[BMK74\].SLALOMComplexA B C DFeature HierarchyFigure 2 Language Complexity in SLALOM 7Figure 2 contains an illustration of a piece ofSLALOM.
We have depicted parts of four hierar-chies in the figure: morphological syntactic fea-tures, noun phrases, verb complements, andvarious relative clauses.
Within each hierarchy,the intention is to capture an ordering on the fea-ture acquisition.
So, for example, the modelreflects the fact that the +ing progressive form ofverbs is generally acquired before the +s pluralform of nouns, which is generally acquired beforethe +s form of possessives, etc.Notice that there are also connections among thehierarchies.
This is intended to capture sets of fea-tures which are acquired at approximately thesame time.
These connections may be derivedfrom work in language assessment and gradeexpectations such as found in \[Ber88\], \[Lee74\],and \[Cry82\].
So, for example, the figure indicatesthat while the +s plural ending is being acquired,7.
We intend this figure as an illustration only.
In particularour current research is focusing on identifying the pre-cise hierarchies, orderings and syntactic features in thehierarchies, as well as relationships among the hierar-chies.so too are both proper and regular nouns, and oneand two word sentences.
During this time, we donot expect o see any relative clauses.We anticipate that SLALOM, when fully devel-oped, will initially outline the typical steps of sec-ond language acquisition.
This model will then betailored to the needs of individual students via aseries of "filters", one for each user characteristicthat might alter the initial generic model.
For in-stance, it is possible that the specific features ofthe student's L 1 will affect the rate or order of ac-quisition of the L2.
In particular, one would expectfeatures hared in the L1 and L2 to be acquiredmore quickly than those which ale not (due to pos-itive language transfer).
Another possible filtercould reflect how much and what kind of formalinstruction the student has had in written English.For example, if the student's educational programstressed subject-verb agreement, this feature couldhave already been learned, even though others"before" it in the original SLA model may remainproblematic.In developing the language learning model and itsfilters, we plan to compare our initial model(derived from acquisition literature) with the writ-ing samples that we have already collected.
8 Wealso expect o seek input from English teachers ofdeaf students.
Additionally, we hope to collectsamples of teachers' corrections and comparethem to the models that will have been hypothe-sized.Once the SLALOM model is complete for thepopulation under study, presumably we will havea model of the order in which we expect our ASLusers to acquire written English.
Essentially, wewill need to "place" a particular user in the model.With this placement we will have a model of (1)what features we expect he student has masteredand is using consistently -- these are featuresbelow the user's level in the model, (2) what fea-tures we expect he user to be using or attemptingto use, but with limited success -- these are fea-tures at the user's level, and (3) what features we8.
Note that we have collected writing samples with someuser information for the authors of each sample.
Whileour analysis o far has been restricted to proficient ASLsigners, samples from other deaf writers might help usdetermine what the ASL "influence" filter (for example)might look like since it would apply to one group ofsamples but not to another.76do not expect o see used (correctly) -- these arefeatures above the user's level.Essentially we cfin view the placement in SLA-LOM as highlighting language features (and cor-responding mal-rules) that we expect he user tobe using at a given point in time.
Thus, it gives usa glimpse of the user's generation process byzeroing in on the mal-rules we expect him/her tobe using at this point in their acquisition ofEnglish.The initial placement of the student on SLALOMwill most likely be based on an analysis of thefirst input sample.
Once this initial determinationis made, further input from the student, as well asfeedback given during the correction and tutorialphases, could cause the system to update theuser's profile in the model.
It is important to notethat although the default levels (i.e., cross-hierar-chical connections) for the process of second lan-guage acquisition will be somewhat predeffined,the model is flexible enough to allow and accountfor individual variations beyond those representedby the initial model and its filters.
In other words,additional information about each student's lan-guage usage gathered over time should provide abetter and more accurate reflection of the currentset of language features they are acquiring.5 Response StrategiesThere are a large number of issues that must bedealt with in determining an appropriate responsefor a student.
These include choosing which errorsto respond to, selecting an overall type of re-sponse, and generating the actual English responseitself.
In this paper we focus on just two aspects ofresponse generation that rely on our model of thelearner's generation process.
The first is determin-ing which errors to respond to in detail, and thesecond deals with the kind of English syntacticconstructions to use in the realization of the re-sponse.Our decisions concerning both of these aspectsstem from work in second language acquisitionand educational research.
This work indicates thatas a learner is mastering a subject, there is a certainsubset of the material that is currently "within theirgrasp".
This has been called the Zone of ProximalDevelopment (ZPD) by Vygotsky \[Vyg86\].
Thisgeneral idea has been applied to assessment andwriting instruction by \[Rue90\].
There is a similarprinciple outlined in \[Kra81\] with respect o sec-ond language acquisition.
Intuitively the knowl-edge or concepts within the ZPD are "ready to belearned" by the learner.
It is what he/she is current-ly in the process of acquiring.We see our model of the user (including his/herplacement in SLALOM) as capturing the ZPDwith respect to second language acquisition.
Thishas several implications on the responses given bythe system.5.1 Deciding the Errors to Focus OnAccording to the above literature, instruction andcorrective feedback dealing with aspects withinthe ZPD may be beneficial.
On the other hand, in-struction or corrective feedback dealing with as-pects outside of the ZPD will likely have littleeffect and may even be harmful to the learningprocess (in the sense that the user may becomebored or confused by information that they are un-able to comprehend or apply).
Thus in our systemwe plan to concentrate on correcting errors that in-volve features that are at or slightly above thelearner's placement in SLALOM.
Thus, we willprovide instruction on those aspects of the lan-guage that the user is ready to acquire.As an example of the way SLALOM can be usedin correction, consider the apparent similarity inthe following two mistakes taken from differentsources.
The first was typed by one of the authorsin an early draft of this paper: "That is, learners donot seem to acquired exactly one construction atatime ..... " A similar mistake is found in one of ourwriting samples from a student who is learningEnglish as a second language.
The student's writ-ing is fairly good, but still contains many errors in-volving appropriate verb morphology: "It's veryhard for me to tell you what I am think about XXXbecause..."9Notice that he errors look very similar to each oth-er.
In the first sample the bare form of the verbshould appear after the infinitive marker "to"; in-stead, the verb appears to be inflected with tense.In the second sample the +ing form of the verbshould appear affter the helping verb "am", but thebare form is included instead.
Thus, in some sense,both instances could occur because the writer doesnot understand what form of the verb is required inthe given circumstances.
At first glance it may9.
We have replaced the name of the student's chool withXXX to protect the identity of  our sources.77seem approp~ate to include tutorial dialogue ex-pinning verb morphology in both cases.However, if the level of English acquisition is tak-en into account via a model ike SLALOM, signif-icantly better correction can be given.
Forexample, in the first case the user's placement inSLALOM would indicate that he/she has alreadymastered the appropriate verb morphology.
Thusthe error should be seen as a typo.
It should bepointed out so that it can be corrected, but tutorialdialogue on appropriate verb morphology is cer-tainly not necessary and would be inappropriate.In contrast, the second writer would be placed at avery different level within SLALOM.
In particu-lar, his/her placement would indicate that he/she isstill in the process of acquiring verb morphology;mistakes of the kind given in this sentence arerather common for this writer.
As a result, tutorialdialogue explaining appropriate verb morphologyis quite appropriate and has a good chance of hav-ing a positive effect on the leamer's writing.5.2 Tailoring Responses to theStudent's Language AbilityOne of the few areas of general agreement amongmost SLA researchers i  that linguistic input at ornear the user's current second language proficien-cy is beneficial for the acquisition/learning pro-cess \[Kra82\], \[Tar82\], \[Vyg86\], \[Hat831.
Thisprinciple may be expressed in different ways, butthe idea is essentially the same.For example, in Krashen's "monitor" model ofSLA \[Kra81\], \[Kra82\] he describes the learningprocess as a series of language level attainments.The level of the user's current ability in the sec-ond language is designated i.
According toKrashen, in order to facilitate quicker progress,the most helpful input will include features of thei+ l level.For Tarone and others, this phenomena is referredto as foreigner talk.
It describes the almost uncon-scious manner in which native speakers of a lan-guage automatically simplify their speech toaccommodate second language learners.
Inputsimplification is also a key premise in pidginiza-tion/creolization accounts of acquisition \[Hat83\].For the most part, these types of simplificationhave been shown to be very helpful to the learner.However, Chaudron points out that there are acouple of "simplification" strategies that may notalways be beneficial \[Cha83\].
1?Given this evidence, it is very important for theICICLE system to have the ability to generate textat or near the user's current second language pro-ficiency.
The syntactic omplexity can no longerbe left to chance or indirect constraints.
Ourintention is that the user's placement in SLALOMwill help guide the kind of constructions that thesystem should use in its generated text.
That is,the system should attempt to generate texts whichuse constructions that are at (or slightly above)the level he/she is placed in SLALOM.Our initial investigations lead us to believe thatthis may be done within FUE a functional unifica-tion-based text generation system \[Elh93\] througha dynamic ordering of altemative realizations(ALTs).
l I In other words, at ALT branches in thegrammar, the alternatives will be ordered epend-ing on the user's current placement within SLA-LOM.
Those constructions that are at or slightlyabove the user's level will be preferred by order-ing them before other potential realizations.
If theuser model is updated and the user's placement onSLALOM changes, a new ordering of the alterna-tives would reflect his change.6 ConclusionIn this paper we have introduced a section of an in-telligent computer-assisted language learning sys-tem that attempts to capture the user's currentgeneration capabilities.
This linguistic model isbased on two components: a model of the user'sfirst language (in our case, ASL) and a model cap-turing the user's progress in acquiring the secondlanguage.
Having this dual model in the systemhelps us understand the user's input in terms of theerrors that they make.
In addition, the linguisticmodel can be used to provide corrective feedbackthat is most likely to be beneficial to the user.7 AcknowledgmentsThis work is supported by NSF Grant # IRI-9416916 and by a Rehabilitation Engineering Re-search Center Grant from the National Institute on10.
