Whenmore than two siml)lc sentences(cla, uses) ,,re extracted,847they are transferred to complex sentence conversionbased on user detlnable complex sentence J /E  transla-tion patterns.TWP can make user reach a target English by theirmonitoring and controlling Japanese-English conver-sion process~ so that they can feel content with eachstep of every interactive assistances or automatic pro-cesses.
It can also save key strokes for arranging wordorder as it generates English expressions in a correctword order by conversion capability of a phras% a sin>pie sentence and a complex sentence, besides wordlevel dictionary consultation facility.
TWP also hasproposed a protocol to eliminate redundant user keystrokes for selecting menu or commanding process bydefault reasoning to guess user's next stroke.
Thismeans that no other key strokes are sometimes nec-essary than those for inputting Japanese sentences, astransh~tion is over at the same time of that a period ofa Japanese sentence is keyed-in on a screen.Whenever any error of conversion is found while in-putting Japanese, any step during the conversion canbe cancelled and corrected by adopting the second al-ternative automatically based on key stroke historylearning mechanism.
A cheap cancel and undo proto-col is the key issue to make the best use of each defaultreasoning of TWP system, because strokes to selectcorrect one after cancels and undos are the sources fortuning up default reasoning by learning mechanism.2 What  is considered of forcomfortable usabil ity?TWP brings about both users' contentment with func-tions that machine translation has failed to realize,and large cost reduction ibr sentence generation in tar-get language that simple dictionary consultation facil-ity has not fulfilled.
No other system has ever beenpresented to satisfy two of them at the same time.Machine translation system takes no hmnan cost ifcomplete translation is acquired.
If any errors occur,however, manual re-translation or post-editing chargesvast amount of expense.
Post-editors have reported somany time high stress by repetitious or utterly unex-pected errors machine translation caused.
Moreover,even when they use Japanese-English automatic trans-lation system~ they are required to comprehend bothlanguages in reality.
Experience of using dictionaryconsultation facilities and grammar checkers tells usthat such assistance as bilingual dictionary reference,sample sentence reference and grammatical check doesnot contribute so much to efficiency of translation andthat the key operation cost taken to call those func-tions, e.g.
key strokes, is essentially no less than thatin case of consulting paper dictionaries.TWP peribrms automatic recognition of a word, aphrase, and a simple sentence, and immediately af-ter that, successive conversion based on bilingual worddictionary ~ and simple phrase and simple sentencetranslation functim, is executed.
These recognition,and conversion processes are supervised by the userin the course of inputting Japanese text.
TWP usersreserve the means of cancelling and resolving the er-rors that the recognition or conversion created.
TWPmakes users feel content with processes on a screen byconfirming every step of translation with their eyes.TWP supports so much easy use of dictionary con-sultation facility in such a manner that either Englishand Japanese word on a cursor position is interpretedas a key word for looking up word and bilingual dic-tionaries, and is transferred any time automatically toconsultation facility to retrieve and display the dictio-nary data on a pull-down window.
Users need not totake a special dictionary look up procedure.It assists longer sentence gener,~tion i English wordorder by J /E  conversion using complex sentence trans-lation patterns defined by users\[5\], as well as using aphrase and a simple sentence translation facility.In the following chapter~ we explain the overview ofTWP; English producing support system at first thentalk about Japanese-to-English interactive conversionframework for comfortable English composition in par-ticular.3 Which Resources supportEnglish Composi t ion ?TWP for English composition support is constructedfl'om well understood and transparent resources andmechanisms under an extended, what is called, Kana-Kanji convcrsion user interface.
The noble featureof tile (PWP iutroduced hereafter~ is of great trans-parency in every 1)rocess of support mechanism.
~l'hetraceability of process and the controllability of theTWP based on default reasoning mechanism in recog-nition and conversion of logical units in Japanese in-put, and cheap cancellability of wrong steps selectedby TWP or a user are a noble part of invention whichsupports a great cost reduction of English productionon Japanese word processors with full of contentment.The characteristics of TWP is summarized as fol-lows.1.

are explicated here from now on.Whenever TWP finds Japanese word en(l, phraseend or clause end, the translation equiwdent is dis-played on a screen line for inputting Japanese.
J /Econversion eeds scope determination of phrases andclauses.
The TWP iterates scope determination andconversion very explicitly on a screen for realisingtraceability and transparency of translation.Two issues are left necessary to explain fllrther.1.
How to determine a scope of conw',rsion ?2.
tIow to lind an appropriate type.
of conversion ?The tlgure 2 of intuitive image of J /E  conversiondepicts the two issues more clearly.4.2 How to al ign a sequence  of  conver-s ion step ?The scope determination tbr conversion is one of keyissues to specify eemfortable user interfa.ce.
The con~version should be carried out successfully at any case.
()therwise, users cannot rely on the conversion supportand have anxiety of operation.
The sequence of con-version steps shouhl also be Lraceable within a limitedhuman's eye capacity, that is to say, which conversionscope selected by TWP should be able to guess, andwhat sequence of conversions also should be foresee-M)le.
User can catch up with every proce.ss very easilyif user conhl expect ew'xy kind of change on a screen.TWP's idea to resolve user's anxiety (:ome.s from theabove observation, to afford to the items 4. and 8.above greatly.There are two reasonable scope interpretations forJ /E  conversion on the screen1 where a cursor staysjust after a Japanese string ~}~tNJ(~ which is con>posed of two Japanese phrases (bunsetsuis),\[*J,:I , }g:Subject-marker,"I is the head of this u.oun phrase"bunsetsu\],\[~3~: paper, ~:Object-marker, 'paper isthe head of this noun phrase" bunsetsu\].

Stepwise Japanese-English conversionalternative scopes is "~L t?~ ?3 C(cursor)", and theother is "~ gc C".TWP adopts such a simple strategy as a scope tbrconversion is the biggest logical unit of words, phrases,and clauses just adjacent o C(cursor) on the left partof input line.
This strategy comes from Japanese in-trinsic linguistic structure called head final.Whenever an input is don% it is transihrred to mor-phological processing to find logical units like word,phrase, and clause.
A logical unit is handed to J /Econversion function to produce English equivalent.Japanese logical unit has a head word in the right mostpart of it usually so that every end of Japanese unit isguessed much easier than that of Fnglish.
Fortunatelypopular and robust algorithm of detectivg end of unitis widely known and it looks Mmad one word or onephrase to decide whether string on the left of cursoris on the end or not.
In practice, TWP may recognizethe end of unit more easily by hearing unit end signMsfi'om Kana-kanji conversion stroke as well.TWP can gness scope of logical unit with high preci-sion accordingly.
The screen1 and screen2 in the figure3 shows a selected conversion scope is the left smallestphrase(bunsetsu) which is usually signMed by kana-hn j i  conversion key stroke.4.3 S imulated  Mode of Automat ic  J /EConvers ionThe "look ahead" algorithm detecting conversionscope by finding logical unit described above is alsousable in another way.
