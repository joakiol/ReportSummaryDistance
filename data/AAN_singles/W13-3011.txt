Topic models are a newer development in ma-chine learning that play an important role in doc-ument analysis and information retrieval.
It turnsout there is a surprising connection between thetwo that suggests novel ways of extending bothgrammars and topic models.
After explaining thisconnection, I go on to describe extensions whichidentify topical multiword collocations and auto-matically learn the internal structure of named-entity phrases.The adaptor grammar framework is a non-parametric extension of probabilistic context-freegrammars (Johnson et al 2007), which was ini-tially intended to allow fast prototyping of mod-els of unsupervised language acquisition (John-son, 2008), but it has been shown to have applica-tions in text data mining and information retrievalas well (Johnson and Demuth, 2010; Hardisty etal., 2010).
We?ll see how learning the referents ofwords (Johnson et al 2010) and learning the rolesof social cues in language acquisition (Johnson etal., 2012) can be viewed as a kind of topic mod-elling problem that can be reduced to a grammat-ical inference problem using the techniques de-scribed in this talk.2 About the SpeakerMark Johnson is a Professor of Language Science(CORE) in the Department of Computing at Mac-quarie University in Sydney, Australia.
He wasawarded a BSc (Hons) in 1979 from the Univer-sity of Sydney, an MA in 1984 from the Univer-sity of California, San Diego and a PhD in 1987from Stanford University.
He held a postdoc-toral fellowship at MIT from 1987 until 1988, andhas been a visiting researcher at the University ofStuttgart, the Xerox Research Centre in Grenoble,CSAIL at MIT and the Natural Language groupat Microsoft Research.
He has worked on a widerange of topics in computational linguistics, buthis main research areas are computational mod-els of language acquisition, and parsing and its ap-plications to text and speech processing.
He wasPresident of the Association for ComputationalLinguistics in 2003 and is Vice-President elect ofEMNLP, and was a professor from 1989 until 2009in the Departments of Cognitive and LinguisticSciences and Computer Science at Brown Univer-sity.ReferencesEric A.
