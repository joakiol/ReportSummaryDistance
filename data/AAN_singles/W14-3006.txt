As FrameNet has evolved overthe years, we have been building a se-ries of increasingly ambitious prototypesystems that exploit FrameNet as a se-mantic resource.
Results from this workpoint to frames as a natural representationfor applications that require linking textualmeaning to world knowledge.1 IntroductionFrame Semantics (Fillmore, 1976) defines themeaning of a word with respect to the conceptualstructure (Frame) that it evokes.
The promise ofFrame Semantics is that it is a principled methodto connect language analysis with concepts andknowledge.
This paper summarizes over a decadeof research at Berkeley1on computational modelsbridging text and inference using Frame Seman-tics.
We will start with a brief description of thelexical resource, FrameNet2, designed with the ex-plicit goal to capturing insights and findings fromFrame Semantics in an on-line lexicon.
We thendescribe computational models that exploit the se-mantic information in FrameNet for a variety ofNLP tasks.2 FrameNetThe Berkeley FrameNet project (Fillmore, John-son, & Petruck, 2003) is building a lexicon basedon the theory of Frame Semantics.
In FrameNet,the meanings of lexical items (lexical units (LU))are defined with respect to larger structured repre-sentations, called Frames.
Individual lexical units1All the work described was done while the author wasat the University of California, Berkeley and the Interna-tional Computer Science Institute (ICSI) / 1947 Center Street,Berkeley CA 94704.2http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.eduevoke specific frames and establish a binding pat-tern to specific slots or roles (frame elements (FE))within the frame.
FrameNet describes the under-lying frames for different lexical units, examinessentences related to the frames using a very largecorpus, and records (annotates) the ways in whichinformation from the associated frames are ex-pressed in these sentences.
The result is a databasethat contains a set of frames (related through hier-archy and composition), a set of frame elementsfor each frame, and a set of frame annotated sen-tences that covers the different patterns of usagefor lexical units in the frame.
Collin Baker?s pa-per in this conference has more details on theFrameNet project including the current state of theresource which is now available in multiple lan-guages.
This paper summarizes the results of ap-plying FrameNet in a variety of NLP applications.2.1 FrameNet data as seed patterns forInformation ExtractionWhile FrameNet frames and FE tags are mean-ingful to human interpreters, they are not suit-able for direct use in NLP applications.
Oneearly project explored using the FrameNet anno-tated dataset to automatically compile patterns anda lexicon for Information Extraction (IE) (Mohitand Narayanan, 2003).
A distinguishing featurethat made FrameNet attractive for this purpose wasits explicit mandate to cover all the valence pat-terns for a target word, not just the frequent ones.Thus, FrameNet annotations and valence alterna-tions were designed to capture the long tail forevery target lexeme.
We hypothesized that us-ing a highly precise set of patterns and a lexiconautomatically compiled from the FrameNet framerelational database and annotations should resultgood performance for the task.
To increase cover-age, we extended the frame lexicon with WordNetsynsets.
As a first test, we culled a set of newsstories from Yahoo News Service with topics re-22lated to the topic of crime.
We also compiled aset of IE patterns and lexicon from several crimerelated frames (such as Arrest, Detain, Arraignand Verdict.)
We were able to achieve an aver-age precision of 76.5% and an average recall to66% for the stories in this domain.
However, therelatively sparse and uneven domain coverage ofFrameNet and the absence of high quality parsersand named entity annotators (used for building ex-pressive and general patterns) at the time made thepilot task difficult to repeat in an open domain set-ting.
While the coverage of FrameNet is still anissue, the enormous gains made in the quality andamount of parsed and named entity annotated datacould make this early work attractive again whereFrameNet can be used as a high precision seed pat-tern generator in a semi-supervised IE setting.3 From Frames to InferenceA fundamental aspect of Frame Semantics, onethat directly connected the linguistic insights ofChuck Fillmore to the early work in AI by Schank,Abelson, Minsky, and others was the idea thatFrames were central to how inferences were pack-aged.
In this view, framing provided preferentialaccess to specific expected inferences.
These in-ferences were said to be in the frame.
Schankianscripts (such as the famous restaurant script)(Schank and Abelson, 1977) are a good exampleof such inferential packaging in terms of expectedsequences of events, participants, and outcomes.In addition to providing such general inferences,Chuck Fillmore observed that linguistic framingalso provided a way to delineate multiple perspec-tives on an event (including foregrounding, back-grounding, and participant perspective).
An exam-ple can be found in the perspective difference pro-vided by the lexical items sell, buy, or pay, whichall evoke the commercial transaction frame.
(Chang, Narayanan, & Petruck, 2002), built acomputational formalism that captured structuralframe relationships among participants in a dy-namic scenario.
This representation was used todescribe the internal structure and relationshipsbetween FrameNet frames in terms of parametersfor active event simulations for inference.
We ap-plied our formalism to the commerce domain andshowed how it provides a flexible means of han-dling linguistic perspective and other challengesof semantic representation.
While this work wasable to computationally model subtle inferentialeffects in perspective and framing choice, it re-mains a proof of concept demonstration and therewas a need to do an automatic translation to an in-ference formalism which would enable us to usemore robust reasoners (the trade-off was of coursethat these off the shelf reasoners produced shal-lower inferences).
(Scheffczyk, Baker, & Narayanan, 2010) auto-matically translated a crucial portion of FrameNetto the description logic based web ontology lan-guage OWL, and showed how state-of-the-art de-scription logic reasoners can make inferences overFrameNet-annotated sentences.
Thus, annotatedtext becomes available to the Semantic Web andFrameNet itself can be linked to other ontolo-gies.
While our OWL translation is limited to factsincluded in FrameNet, links to ontologies makeworld knowledge available to reasoning about nat-ural language.
Therefore, are linked FrameNet tothe Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO).This ground work gives a clear motivation for thedesign of further ontology bindings and defines thebaseline for measuring their benefits.Fillmore?s further insights into the connectionsbetween textual inference and world knowledgeled us to ask the question of how a linguisticanalysis of a written document can contribute toidentifying, tracking and populating the eventu-alities that are presented in the document, eitherdirectly or indirectly, and representing degrees ofbelief concerning them.
This work, reported in(Fillmore, Narayanan, & Baker, 2006), attemptsto clarify the boundary between on the one handthe information that can be derived on the basisof linguistic knowledge alone (composed of lex-ical meanings and the meanings of grammaticalconstructions) and on the other hand, reasoningbased on beliefs about the source of a document,world knowledge, and common sense.
In particu-lar, we show that the kind of information producedby FrameNet can have a special role in contribut-ing to text understanding, starting from the ba-sic facts of the combinatorial properties of frame-bearing words (verbs, nouns, adjectives and prepo-sitions) and arriving at the means of recognizingthe anaphoric properties of specific unexpressedevent participants.
Framenet defines a new layer ofanaphora resolution and text cohesion based on theannotations of the different types of null instantia-tions (Definite Null Instantiation (DNI), IndefiniteNull Instantiation (INI), and Constructional Null23Instantiation (CNI)).
A full exploitation of theselinguistic signals in a coreference resolver is stillpending.4 Frame Semantics in QuestionAnsweringAs FrameNet matured, we started asking if it couldbe used for semantically based question answeringfor questions that went beyond factoids and re-quired deeper semantic information.
(Narayananand Harabagiu, 2004; Sinha and Narayanan, 2005;Sinha, 2008) report on a prototype question an-swering system that attempted to answer questionsrelated to causality, event structure, and tempo-rality in specific domains.
The project on Ques-tion Answering (QA) was a joint effort with SandaHarabagiu?s group at UT Dallas.The QA work was based on the fact that events,while independent of language themselves, arefrequently discussed in natural language, yield-ing copious data in that form.
To reason aboutcomplex events requires an interface from eventmodels to data sources.
We sought to exploit se-mantic frames as an intermediate structure and in-terface between event descriptions in natural lan-guage and event models that produce inferencesto answer questions.
In the course of this project,we came up with the basic framework and algo-rithms combining a variety of NLP techniques in-cluding Parsing, Topic Modeling, Named EntityRecognition, and Semantic Role Labeling withdeep event structure inference in multiple do-mains.
The frame structure in language providesa bi-directional mapping from language to eventmodels, enabling us to link information found intext about an event of interest to models that repre-sent that event.
The proof of concept system usedframe parsed input with a set of hand built domainontologies for specific domains.
The system wasable to answer domain questions involving causal,diagnostic, and hypothetical reasoning.
While theresults clearly showed the utility of FrameNet asa resource supporting deep semantic inference, italso delineated the necessity and role of domainspecific ontologies and inference required to real-ize an end-to-end system using FrameNet.5 Frames, Constructions and GrammarYet another of Fillmore?s profound insights wasthe observation that every unit of grammar is mosteffectively described as a pairing between formand meaning, aka a construction.
Constructionsexist at lexical (and sub-lexical) levels as well asat larger granularities (phrases, discourse) play-ing a crucial role in the compositionally of lan-guage.
This proposal, entitled construction gram-mar, has gained considerable empirical support inlarge part due to the investigations of Fillmore,his colleagues and students, reported in a series ofbeautiful papers on the grammatical and composi-tional properties of constructions.3Research on construction grammar has playeda fundamental role within our Berkeley interdis-ciplinary project, NTL4, which is attempting tobuild cognitively plausible computational mod-els of language acquisition and use.
Specifically,NTL research has resulted in the grammar for-malism called Embodied Construction Grammar(ECG), where the meaning pole of a constructionis expressed in terms of bindings between bodilyschemas (also called Image Schemas) and frames.ECG allows constraints of all kinds (phonological,syntactic, semantic, etc.)
in a unification basedprobabilistic framework, where the best fitting in-terpretation in context is selected as the analysisof the input.
ECG is formally defined and com-putationally implemented, and has been used forlinguistic analysis, in models of language com-prehension, and for cognitive models of languagelearning5.6 Frame Semantics and MetaphorFrameNet has long held the goal of including in-formation about metaphorical usage in language.The most recent project on Frame Semantics is theICSI MetaNet project, where the goal is to builda system that extracts linguistic manifestations ofmetaphor (words and phrases that are based onmetaphor) from text and interprets them automati-cally in four different languages.The MetaNet project, is a multi-lingual, multi-university, multi-disciplinary effort that incorpo-rates FN methodology as well as corpus and ma-chine learning techniques, deep cognitive linguis-tics, and behavioral and imaging experiments.MetaNet models metaphor as a mapping be-tween two different frames.
Such mappings3http://www.constructiongrammar.org/ is acurrently active resource on the topic with contributions froma variety of international scholars.4http://ntl.icsi.berkeley.edu/ntl5http://ecgweb.pbworks.com/w/page/15044343/FrontPage24project information from a source frame to a tar-get frame.
The information projected is par-tial and can include the frame, its slots, andfiller constraints.
An initial repository of map-pings that draws on FrameNet frames as sourcesand targets of the mappings is used as base in-formation by a system that extracts additionalmetaphors using machine learning.
The sys-tem uses what it has learned about the relation-ships between the frame elements of conceptualmetaphors to find new metaphors in text.
TheMetaNet Wiki6is a database of such mappings,drawing on FrameNet?s inventory of Frames.
Themappings currently exist in four different lan-guages.
FrameNet frames and mappings constrainthe search for new metaphors, and the discovery ofnew metaphors by a corpus based machine learn-ing algorithm both a) provides empirical supportfor the existing frames and mappings and b) moreimportantly potentially extends the set by identi-fying gaps and inconsistencies in coverage.
Thisinteraction facilitates an iterative design processin MetaNet which is empirically driven and usagebased, just as Fillmore would have insisted.77 Conclusion and Future DirectionsFrame semantics in general and FrameNet in par-ticular show considerable promise for use in deepsemantic analysis.
FrameNet frames are intendedto capture crucial generalizations not available inother lexical resources.
Various prototype sys-tems have clearly demonstrated the potential ofFrameNet to make a qualitative difference in se-mantic NLP.
There remain two crucial gaps thathave to be bridged.
One is the issue of cover-age.
The second is the lack of a formal repre-sentation covering the more subtle inferential as-pects of FrameNet.
Progress is being made of bothfronts as is evidenced in some of the papers in thisworkshop.
If successful, the next few years shouldsee an increasing use and acceptance of FrameNetas a crucial semantic resource bridging languageanalysis with inference.
This will lead to scalableversions of the systems described in this paper,but will also give rise to new applications.
Oneparticularly intriguing area of research is the useof frames for cross-modal semantic representation6http://metaphor.icsi.berkeley.edu7Even at 83, Chuck?s brilliant attention to detail and in-fectious enthusiasm fundamentally shaped the early MetaNetproject on a day-to-day basis, till his illness sadly made directparticipation impossible after 2012.bridging text, speech, and vision.AcknowledgmentsAll the projects described here were collaborationswith the FrameNet and NTL groups at ICSI andBerkeley.
