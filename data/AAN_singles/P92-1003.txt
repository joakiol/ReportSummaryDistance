A SIMPLE BUT USEFUL APPROACH TO CONJUNCT IDENTIF ICAT ION 1Rajeev Agarwal Lois BoggessDepartment ofComputer ScienceMississippi State UniversityMississippi State, MS 39762e-mail: kudzu@cs.msstate.eduABSTRACTThis paper presents an approach to identifyingconjuncts of coordinate conjunctions appearing intext which has been labelled with syntactic andsemantic tags.
The overall project of which thisresearch is a part is also briefly discussed.
Theprogram was tested on a 10,000 word chapter ofthe Merck Veterinary Manual.
The algorithm isdeterministic and domain independent and itperforms relatively well on a large real-lifedomain.
Constructs not handled by the simplealgorithm are also described in some detail.INTRODUCTIONIdentification of the appropriate conjunctsof the coordinate conjunctions in a sentence isfundamental tothe understanding of the sentence.We use the phrase 'conjunct identification' torefer to the process of identifying the components(words, phrases, clauses) in a sentence that areconjoined by the coordinate conjunctions in it.Consider the following sentence:"The president sent a memo to themanagers to inform them of the tragicinciden\[ and to request their co-operation.
"In this sentence, the coordinate conjunction 'and'conjoins the infinitive phrases "to inform themof the tragic incident" and "to request heir co-operation".
If a natural anguage understandingsystem fails to recognize the correct conjuncts, itis likely to misinterpret the sentence or to loseits meaning entirely.
The above is an exampleof a simple sentence where such conjunctidentification is easy.
In a realistic domain, oneencounters sentences which are longer and farmore complex.1 This work is supported in part by the NationalScience Foundation under grant number IRI-9002135.This paper presents an approach toconjunct identification which, while not perfect,gives reasonably good results with a relativelysimple algorithm.
It is deterministic anddomain independent in nature, and is being testedon a large domain - the Merck VeterinaryManual, consisting of over 700,000 words ofuncontrolled technical text.
Consider thissentence from the manual:"The mites live on the surface of theskin of the ear and canal, and feed bypiercing the skin and sucking lymph,with resu l tant  i r r i ta t ion ,inflammation, exudation, and crustformation".This sentence has four coordinate conjunctions;identification of their conjuncts is moderatelydifficult.
It is not uncommon to encountersentences in the manual which are more thantwice as long and even more complex.The following section briefly describes thelarger project of which this research is a part.Then the algorithm used by the authors and itsdrawbacks are discussed.
The last section givesthe results obtained when an implementation wasrun on a 10,000-word excerpt from the manualand discusses ome areas for future research.THE RESEARCH PROJECTThis research on conjunct identification is apart of a larger research project which isexploring the automation of extraction ofinformation from structured reference manuals.The largest manual available to the project inmachine-readable form is the Merck VeterinaryManual, which serves as the primary testbed.The system semi-automatically builds andupdates its knowledge base.
There are twocomponents to the system - an NLP (naturallanguage processing) component and a knowledgeanalysis component.
(See Figure 4 at the end.
)15The NLP component consists of a tagger, asemi-parser, a prepositional phrase attachmentspecialist, a conjunct identifier for coordinateconjunctions, and a restructurer.
The tagger is aprobabilistic program that tags the words in themanual.
These tags consist of two parts - amandatory syntactic portion, and an optionalsemantic portion.
For example: the word'cancer' would be tagged as noun//disorder, theword 'characterized' would be verb~past_p, etc.The semantic portion of the tags providesdomain-specific nformation.
The semi-parser,which is not a full-blown parser, is responsiblefor identifying noun, verb, prepositional, gerund,adjective, and infinitive phrases in the sentences.Any word not captured as one of these is left as asolitary 'word' at the top level of the sentencestructure.
The output produced by the semi-parser has very little embedding and consists ofvery simple structures, as will be seen below.The prepos i t iona l  phrase attachmentdisambiguator and the conjunct identifier forcoordinate conjunctions are considered to be"specialist" programs that work on these simplestructures and manipulate them into more deeplyembedded structures.
More such specialistprograms are envisioned for the future.
Therestructurer is responsible for taking the resultsof these specialist programs and generating adeeper structure of the sentence.
These deeperstructures are passed on to the knowledgeanalysis component.The knowledge analvsis comnonent isresponsible for extracting from these structuresseveral kinds of objects and relationships tobuildand update an object-oriented knowledge base.The system can then be queried about theinformation contained in the text of the manual.This paper primarily discusses the conjunctidentifier for coordinate conjunctions.
Detailedinformation about the other components of thesystem can be found in \[Hodges et al, 1991\],\[Boggess et al, 1991\], \[Agarwal, 1990\], and\[Davis, 1990\].CONJUNCT IDENTIF ICAT IONThe program assigns a case label to everynoun phrase in the sentence, depending on therole that it fulfills in the sentence.
A largeproportion of the nouns of the text have semanticlabels; for the most part, the case label of anoun phrase is the label associated with the headnoun of the noun phrase.
In some instances, apreceding adjective influences the case label ofthe noun phrase, as, for example, when anadjective with a semantic label precedes a genericnoun.
A number of the resulting case labels fornoun phrases (e.g.
time, location, etc.
)aresimilar those suggested by Fillmore \[1972\], butdomain dependent case labels (e.g.
disorder,patient, etc.)
have also been introduced.
Forexample: the noun phrase "a generalizeddermatitis" is assigned a case label of disorder,while "the ear canal" is given a case label ofbody_part.
It should be noted that, while thecoordination algorithm assumes the presence ofsemantic ase labels for noun phrases, based onsemantic tags tor the text, it does not depend onthe specific values of these labels, which changefrom domain to domain.THE ALGORITHMThe algorithm makes the simplifyingassumption that each coordinate conjunctionconjoins only two conjuncts.
One of theseappears hortly after the conjunction and is calledthe post -con junct ,  while the other appearsearlier in the sentence and is referred to as thepre-conjunct .The identification of the post-conjunct isfairly straightforward: the first complete phrasethat follows the coordinate conjunction ispresumed to be the post-conjunct.
This has beenfound to work in all of the sentences on whichthis algorithm has been tested.
The identificationof the pre-conjunct is somewhat morecomplicated.
There are three different levels ofrules that are tried in order to find the matchingpre-conjunct.
These are referred to as level-l,level-2, and level-3 rules in decreasing order ofimportance.
The steps involved in theidentification of the pre- and the post-conjunct aredescribed below.
(a) The sentential components (phrases orsingle words not grouped into a phrase by theparser) are pushed onto a stack until a coordinateconjunction isencountered.
(b) When a coordinate conjunction isencountered, the post-conjunct is taken to be theimmediately following phrase, and its type (nounphrase, prepositional phrase, etc.)
and case labelare noted.
(c) Components are popped off the stack,one at a time, and their types and case labels arecompared with those of the post-conjunct.
Foreach component that is popped, the rules at level-1 and level-2 are tried first.
If both the type andcase label of a popped component match those ofthe post-conjunct (level-I rule), then thiscomponent is taken to be the pre-conjunct.Otherwise, if the type of the popped componentis the same as that of the post-conjunct and thecase label is compat ib le  (case labels likemedication and treatment, which are semantically16sentence(\[noun_phrase(ease_ labe l (body_par t} ,  \[(~h?, det), (?~r, noun I body_part)\])verb_phrase(\[(should, aux), (be, aux), (cleaned, verb l past_p)l)prep_phrase(\[(by, prep),gerund_phrase( \ [ ( f lush ing,  verb I gerund)I)1)word(\[(away, advl  I location)\])noun_phrase(ease  labe l{unknown) ,  \[(the, det), (debris, noun)\])word(\[(and, conj I co ord)\])noun_phrase(ease_ labe l{body_ f lu ld ) ,  \[(exudate, noun l I body_fluid)\])gerund_phrase( \ [ (us ing,  verb I gerund),noun_phrase(ease_ labe l{medicat ion} ,  \[(warm, adj), (saline,adj I I medication), (solution, noun l I medication)\])\])word(\[(or, conj I co_ord)\])noun phrase(ease_ labe l{unknown) ,  \[(water, noun)\])prep_phrase(\[(with, prep),noun phrase(ease_ labe l{medicat ion) ,  \[(a,det), (very, adv I degree),(dilute, adj I I degree), (germicidal, adj I I medical),(detergent, noun I I medication)\])\])word(\[(comma, punc)\])word( \ [ (and,  conj I co_ord)\])noun_phrase(case_ labe l{body_par t ) ,  \[(the, det), fcanal, noun l I body_part)\])verb_phrase(\[(dr ied,  verb I past  p)\])word(\[(as, conj I correlative)I)word(\[(gently,  adv)\])word(\[(as, conj I correlative)\])adj_phrase(\[(possible,  adj)\])\]).F igure  1similar, are considered to be compatible) to thatof the post-conjunct (level-2 rule), then thiscomponent is identified as the pre-conjunct.
Ifthe popped component satisfies neither of theserules, then another component is popped fromthe stack and the level- 1 and level-2 rules are triedfor that component.
(d) If no component is found that satisfiesthe level-1 or level-2 rules and the beginning ofthe sentence is reached (popping components offthe stack moves backwards through the sentence),then the requirement that the case label be eitherthe same or compatible is relaxed.
Thecomponent with the same type as that of thepost-conjunct (irrespective of the case label) thatis closest to the coordinate conjunction, isidentified as the pre-conjunct (level-3 rule).
(e) If a pre-conjunct is still not found, thenthe post-conjunct is conjoined to the first word inthe sentence.Although there is very little embedding ofphrases in the structures provided by the semi-parser, noun phrases may be embedded inprepositional phrases, infinitive phrases, andgerund phrases on the stack.
The algorithm doespermit noun phrases that are post-conjuncts obeconjoined with noun phrases embedded as objectsof, say, a previous prepositional phrase (e.g., inthe sentence fragment "in dogs and cats", thenoun phrase 'cats' is conjoined with the nounphrase 'dogs' which is embedded as the object ofthe prepositional phrase 'in dogs'), or othersimilar phrases.We have observed empirically that, at leastfor this fairly carefully written and edited manual,long distance conjuncts have a strong tendency toexhibit high degrees of parallelism.
Hence,conjuncts that are physically adjacent may merelybe of the same syntactic type (or may even besyntactically dissimilar); as the distance betweenconjuncts increases, the degree of parallelismtends to increase, so that conjuncts are highlylikely to be of the same semantic ategory, andsyntactic and even lexical repetitions are to befound (e.g., on those occasions when a post-conjunct is to be associated with a prepositionalphrase that occurs 30 words previous, thepreposition may well be repeated).
The gist ofthe algorithm, then, is as follows: to look forsentential components with the same syntacticand semantic ategories as the post-conjunct, firstnearby and then with increasing distance towardthe beginning of the sentence; failing to findsuch, to look for the same syntactic category,17sentence(\[prep_phrase(\[(with, prep),noun_phrase(\[ (pers istent,  ad j l l  time), (or, conjlco_ord), (untreated,  adj),(otitis_externa, noun I I disorder)I)\])word(\[(comma, pune)\])noun phrase(\[(the, det), (epithelium, noun)\])prep_phrase(\[(of, prep),noun phrase(\[(the, det), (ear, noun I I body_part),(canal, noun l I body_part)\])\])verb_phrase(\ [ (undergoes,  v rb 13sg)\])noun_phrase(\[(hypertrol~hy,  noun I I disorder)\])word( \ [ (and,  eonj I co_ord)\])verb_phrase(\[(becomes, v rb I beverb 13sg)\])adj_phrase(\[ ( f ibroolast ie,  adj I I disorder)\])\]).F igure 2first close at hand and then with increasingdistance, and if all else fails to default to thebeginning of the sentence as the pre-conjunct (thesemi-parser does not recognize clauses as such,and there may be no parallelism of any kindbetween the beginnings of coordinated clauses).Provisions must be made for certain kinds ofparallelism which on the surface appear to besyntactically dissimilar - for example, the near-equivalence of noun and gerund phrases.
In thetext used as a testbed, gerund phrases are freelycoordinated with noun phrases in virtually allcontexts.
Our probabilistic labelling system iscurrently being revised to allow the semanticcategories for nouns to be associated withgerunds, but at the time this experiment wasconducted, gerund phrases were recognized asconjuncts with nouns only on syntactic grounds -a relatively weak criterion for the algorithm.Further, there are instances in the text whereprepositional phrases are conjoined withadjectives or adverbs - the results reported here donot incorporate provisions for such.
Considerthe sentence "The ear should be cleaned byflushing away the debris and exudate using warmsaline solution or water with a very dilutegermicidal detergent, and the canal dried as gentlyas possible."
The semi-parser produces thestructure shown in Figure 1.
The second 'and'conjoins the entire clause preceding it with theclause that follows it in the sentence.
Althoughthe algorithm does not identify clause conjuncts,it does identify the beginnings of the twoclauses, "the ear" and "the canal", as the pre- andpost-conjuncts, in spite of several interveningnoun phrases.
This is possible because the caselabels of both these noun phrases agree (they arcboth body_part).18THE DRAWBACKSBefore reporting the results of animplementation of the algorithm on a 10,000word chapter of the Merck Veterinary Manual wedescribe some of the drawbacks of the currentimplementation.
(i) The algorithm assumes that a coordinateconjunction conjoins only two conjuncts in asentence.
This assumption is often incorrect.
Ifa construct like \[A, B, C, and D\] appears in asentence, the coordinate conjunction 'and'frequently, but not always, conjoins all fourcomponents.
(B, for example, could beparenthetical.)
The implemented algorithm looksfor only two conjuncts and produces a structurelike \[A, B, \[and \[C, DIll, which is counted ascorrect for purposes of reporting error ratesbelow.
Our "coordinate conjunction specialist"needs to work very closely with a "commaspecialist" - an as-yet undeveloped programresponsible for, among other things, identifyingparallelism in components separated by commas.
(ii) The current semi-parser ecognizescertain simple phrases only and is unable torecognize clause boundaries.
For the conjunctidentifier, this means that it becomes impossibleto identify two clauses with appropriate xtentsas conjuncts.
The conjunct identifier has,however, been written in such a way thatwhenever a "clause specialist" is developed, thefinal structure produced should be correct.Therefore, the conjunct identifier was heldresponsible for correctly recognizing only thebeginnings of the clauses that are beingconjoined.Similarly, for phrases not explicitlyrecognized by the semi-parser, the currentconjunct specialist is expected only to conjointhe beginnings of the phrases - not to somehowbound the extents of the phrases.
Consider thesentence(\[noun_phrase(\[(antibacterial, adj I I medication),(drugs,noun I plurall I medication)\])verb_phrase(\[(administered, verb I past_p)\])prep_phrase(\[(in, prep),noun_phrase(\[(the, det),(feed, noun)\])\])verb phrase(\[(appeared, verb lbeverb)\])inf_phrase(\[(to, infinitive), verb_phrase(\[(be, v rb lbeverb)\]),adj_phrase(\[(effective, adj)\])l)prep_phrase(\[(in, prep),noun_phrase(\[(some, adj I I quantity),(herds, noun lplural I I patient)\])\])word(\[w(and, conj I co_ord)\])prep_phrase(\[(with out, prep),noun_phrase(\[fbenefit, noun)\])\])prep_phrase(\[(in, prep),noun_phrase(\[(others, p o I plural)\])\])\]).Figure 3sentence "With persistent or untreated otitisexterna, the epithelium of the ear canal undergoeshypertrophy and becomes fibroplastic."
Thestructure received by the coordination specialistfrom the semi-parser is shown in Figure 2.
Inthis sentence, the components "undergoeshypertrophy" and "becomes fibroplastic" areconjoined by the coordinate conjunction 'and'.The conjunct identifier only recognizes the verbphrases "undergoes" and "becomes" as the pre-and post-conjuncts respectively and is notexpected to realize that the noun phrasesfollowing the verb phrases are objects of theseverb phrases.
(iii) Although it is generally true that thecomponents o be conjoined should be of thesame type (noun phrase, infinitive phrase, etc.
),some cases of mixed coordination exist.
Thecurrent algorithm allows for the mixing of onlygerund and noun phrases.
Consider the sentence"Antibacterial drugs administered in the feedappeared to be effective in some herds andwithout benefit in others."
The structure that thecoordination specialist receives from the semi-parser is shown in Figure 3.
Note that theprepositional phrases are eventually attached totheir appropriate components, sothat the phrase"in some herds" ultimately is attached to theadjective "effective".
The system does notinclude any rule for the conjoining ofprepositional phrases with adjectival or adverbialphrases.
Hence the phrases "effective in someherds" and "without benefit in others" were notconjoined.RESULTS AND FUTURE WORKThe algorithm was tested on a 10,000 wordchapter of the Merck Veterinary Manual.
Theresults of the tests are shown in Table 1.
We aresatisfied with these results for the followingreasons:(a) The system is being tested on a largebody of uncontrolled text from a real domain.
(b) The conjunct identification algorithm isdomain independent.
While the semantic labelsproduced by the probabilistic labelling system aredomain dependent, and the rules for generalizingthem to case labels for the noun phrases containsome domain dependencies (there is someevidence, for example, that a noun phraseTable 1:Con iunctionandOrbutTOTALResults of the algorithm on the 'Eye and Ear' chapterTotal Cases Cowect Cases Percenm~e366 305 83.3%137 109 79.6%41 30 73.2%544 444 81.6%19consisting of a generic noun preceded by asemantically abelled modifier should not alwaysreceive the semantic label of the modifier) theconjunct specialist pays attention only towhether the case labels match - not to the actualvalues of the case labels.
(c) The true error rate for the simpleconjunct identification algorithm alone is lowerthan the 18.4% suggested by the table, andmaking some fairly obvious modifications willmake it lower still.
The entire system iscomposed of several components and the errorscommitted by some portions of the system affectthe error rate of the others.
A significantproportion of the errors committed by theconjunct identifier are due to incorrect agging,absence of semantic tags for gerunds, improperparsing, and other matters beyond its control.For example, the fact that gerunds were notmarked with the semantic labels attached tonouns has resulted in a situation where anygerund occurr ing as post-conjunct  ispreferentially conjoined with any preceding~eneric noun.
More often than not, the gerundshould have received a semantic tag and wouldproperly be conjoined to a preceding non-genericnoun phrase that would have been of the samesemantic type.
(The conjunction specialist is notthe only portion of the system which wouldbenefit from semantic tags on the gerunds; thesystem is currently under revision to includethem.
)From an overall perspective, the conjunctidentification algorithm presented above seems tobe a very promising one.
It does depend a lotupon help received from other components of thesystem, but that is almost inevitable in a largesystem.
The identification of conjuncts is vitalto every NLP system.
However, the authorswere unable to find references to any currentsystem where success rates were reported forconjunct identification.
We believe that thereason behind this could be that most systemshandle this problem by breaking it up intosmaller parts.
They start with a moresophisticated parser that takes care of some of theconjuncts, and then employ some semantic toolsto overcome the ambiguities that may still existdue to co-ordinate conjunctions.
Since thesesystems do not have a "specialist" workingsolely for the purpose of conjunct identification,they do not have any statistic about the successrate for it.
Therefore, we are unable to compareour success rates with those of other systems.However, due to the reasons given above, we feelthat an 81.6% success rate is satisfactory.We have noted several other modificationsthat would improve performance of the conjunctspecialist.
For example, it has been noticed thatthe coordinate conjunction 'but' behavessufficiently differently from 'and' and 'or' towarrant a separate set of rules.
The currentalgorithm also ignores lexical parallelism (directrepetition of words already employed in thesentence), which the writers of our text frequentlyuse to override plausible alternate readings.
Thecurrent algorithm errs in most such contexts.
Asmentioned above, the algorithm also needs toallow prepositional phrases to be conjoined withadjectives and adverbs in some contexts.
Someattempt was made to implement such mixedcoordination as a last level of rules, level-4, butit did not meet with a lot of success.FUTURE RESEARCHIn addition to the above, the mostimportant step to be taken at this point is tobuild the comma specialist and clause recognitionspecialist.
Another problem that needs to beaddressed involves deciding priorities when one ormore prepositional phrases are attached to oneofthe conjuncts of a coordinate conjunction.
Forexample, we need to decide between the structures\[\[A and B\] in dogs\] and \[A and \[B in dogs\]\],where A and B are typically large structuresthemselves, A and B should be conjoined, and 'indogs' may appropriately be attached to B.
It isnot clear whether the production of theappropriate structure in such cases rightfullybelongs to the knowledge analysis portion of oursystem, or whether most such questions can beanswered by the NLP portion of our system withthe means at its disposal.
Further, the basicorganization of the NLP component, with thetagger and the semi-parser generating the flatstructure and then the various specialist programsworking on the sentence structure to improve it,looks a lot like a blackboard system architecture.Therefore, one of the future ventures could be totry to look into some blackboard architecture andassess its applicability in this system.Finally, there are ambiguities inherentlyassociated with coordinate conjunctions,including the problem of differentiating between"segregatory" and "combinatory" use ofconjunctions \[Quirk et al, 1982\] (e.g.
"fly andmosquito repellants" could refer to 'fly' and'mosquito repellants' or to 'fly repellants' and'mosquito repcllants'), and the determination ofwhether the 'or' in a sentence is really used as an'and'  (e.g.
"dogs with glaucoma orkeratoconjunctivitis will recover" implies thatdogs with glaucoma and dogs withkeratoconjunctivitis will recover).
The currentalgorithm does not address these issues.20REFERENCESAgarwal, Rajeev.
