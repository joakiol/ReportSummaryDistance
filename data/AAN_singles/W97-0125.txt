A Local Grammar-based Approach to Recognizing ofProper Names in Korean TextsJee-Sun NAM* **, Key-Sun CHOI*nam@worldkaist.ac.kr, kschoi@worldkaist.ac.kr* CAIR, Deparlment ofComputer Science, KAIST, Korea** IGM, University of Maroe-la-Vallee, FranceAbstractWe present an LO-based approach to recognizing of Proper Names in Korean texts.Local grammars (LGs) are constructed byexamining specific syntactic contexts of lexicalelements, given that the general syntactic rules, independent from lexical items, cannotprovide accurate analyses.
The LGs will be represented under the form of Finite StateAutomata (FSA) in our system.So far as we do not have a dictionary which would provide all proper names, we needauxiliary tools to analyze them.
We will examine contexts where strings containing propernames occur.
Our approach consists in building an electronic lexicon of PNs in a way moresatisfactory than other existing methods, uch as their recognition i  texts by means ofstatistical pproaches or by rule-based methods.1.
IntroductionIn this paper, we present a description of the typology of nominal phrases containing ProperNames (IN) and the local grammars \[GrogT\],\[Moh94\] constructed on the basis of this description.The goal is to implement a system which detects automatically PNs in a given text, allowing theconstruction ofan electronic lexicon of PNs.The definition of Proper Nouns, as opposed to that of Common Nouns, is often a problematicissue in linguistic descriptions \[Gar91\].
PNs are understood in general as phonic sequencesassociated with one referent, without any intrinsic meanings, uch as Socrates, Bach or Paris.
Theyusually are characterized by nominal determination, the upper case marker, prohibition ofpluralizing procedure, or non-translativity \[Wi191\].
However, semantic or syntactic riteria do notallow to distinguish these two categories in an operational way.
For example, nouns such as sun,earth or moon, semantically appropriate o the definition of proper nouns such as Mars or Jupiter,do not have to be written with the upper case initial: hence, they are not considered as proper nouns.On the contrary, some proper nouns such as Baudelaire or Napoleon can be used as well as commonnouns in contexts where they occur in metonymic or metaphorical relations with common nounslike:I read some (Baudelaire + poems of Baudelaire)He is a real (Napoleon + general)Moreover, they often allow, like common nouns, the derivation of adjectives: e.g.
Socratic,Napoleonic or Parisian.
These are also written with initial upper case, differently from usualadjectives.The situation concerning French is similar to that.
Let us consider \[Gar91\]:273J'ai dcoutd (du Bach + ,~e la musique)J' ai bu (du Champagne +du vin rouge)Derivational productivity is also underlined: socratique, parisien or newyorkais, which however donot begin in the upper case.In the case of  Engli,;h or French, one could delimit formally the category proper nouns bymeans of the upper case, even though this criterion does not correspond entirely to our intuitionabout proper nouns.
However, in Korean, there are no typographical markers uch as upper case vs.lower case, while one assumes that the nouns such as in (1) could be semantically and syntacticallydifferent from those of(2):(1) ~ ~--$-, z-l~.
_=~Kim Minu, Seoul, France(2) ~},  -~: ,  q-~namja\[rnan\], sudo\[capital\], nala\[country\]This situation makes more difficult the distinction between proper nouns and common nouns than inthe case of  French or English, when the former appears in the same grammatical positions as thelatter like:(I listened to (Masart + classic misic) all day)-,-~ (~_~2~ +~.
~y_~) .~ ~(He only drinks (Bordeaux + red wine))The derivation of some other categories from PNs is also observed:~;~ ~ - ~ \[in Park JungHee's manner\]~z~.
.
=~-  \[France style\]~- .
~-o~ \[Chinese (language)\]In fact, the distinction between these two categories might be arbitrary.
We should perhaps considera continuum of the noun system: a thesaurus of nouns constituted of the most generic nouns to themost specific nouns (which we call proper nouns).
The following example shows a part of a nounhierarchy (Figure 1):AllPhys ica l~ ~ AbstractAnimate Non-Animate",,ffiPerson Animal (not-human)".ffiKorean American ...a /Kim MinU Park JungHee ...
Figure 1Therefore, in the automatic analyses of texts written in Korean, we intend to consider the definitionproblem of proper nouns from a different view point: whatever the given definition of proper nounsis, once a complete list of them is available, we presumably do not need any longer this particulardistinction between proper and common nouns.
All nouns have some semantic and syntacticproperties, which lead to group them into several classes, not by binary distinctions.
Nevertherless, itseems till hard to establish an exhaustive list of what we call proper nouns.
Actually, proper nouns,important in number and in frequency, are one of the most problematic units for all automaticanalyzers of natural anguage texts.274In this study, we will focus on the problems of recognition of proper names.
We do not try tocharacterize them as an axiomatic class, but attach to them a formal definition to determineexplicitly the object of our study.
Here is our formal criterion:{X e (Interrogative Pron -~?
\[Who?\]) \[X e (DECOS-NS) }H u \ [ x ~ ~ r a o n  nouns \[DECOS-NS\]That is, proper names are determined by the fact that they do not exist in our lexicon of Koreancommon nouns (DECOS-NS/V01) \[Nam94\], and by their correspondence with the interrogativepronoun '-~5 z nugu?
\[who?\]'.
The nouns considered as proper names according to these conditionsdo not always correspond to our semantic intuition.
Nevertheless, they usually do not have intrinsicmeanings; and they do not have explicitly distinct referents.
Given that a lexicon of Korean commonnouns (DECOS-NS) has already been built \['Nam94\], the ambiguity across the category of commonnouns and that of proper ones will be settled only in one of these two lexicons by looking upDECOS-NS: if they already are included in this lexicon, we do not consider them in the lexicon ofproper nouns, without questioning their linguistic status.
Remember that our goal is not to discussthe nature of this noun class, but to complete the lexicon of Korean Nouns in NLP systems.
In orderto handle them in an NLP system, given that we do not have yet a dictionary which provides allproper nouns, auxiliary methods are required, such as syntactic information or local grammars thatallow to analyze them.In the following sections, we will classify in five types the contexts where Proper Names canappear, and describe their characteristics in detail.2.
Typology of PN Contexts2.1.
Type I < PN-(Postposition + E) >This type of noun phrases is without any particular characteristics inherent o Proper Names(PLY).
They actually occur in the positions of common nouns, as shown in the following graph(Figure 2):Figure 2.
Type I of Nominal Phrases containing PArsPostpositions observed on the right side of nouns (proper or common ones) indicate grammaticalfunctions of the attached noun.
When they appear in this context, there are no ways to sort outproper names, only by analyzing their syntactic structures.
Let us consider:~ol  "~?--1 ~l~1.olr-.1-Kim 3ung II - i bughan-eui tongchija-idaPN<Kim Jung II>-Postp North Korea-of president-be(Kim Jung II is the President of North Korea)275t?We cannot distingnish this PN <Kim Jung I!> from other nouns that can be found in this position,such as in the following:(=z ~+z-~) .o l  ~ro_4 ~\]~o\]r-q-(geu namja + josenin)-~i bughan-eui tongchija-ida( (This man +A Korean) is the President of North Korea)As mentioned above, in English or in French, proper names could be distinguished from commonnouns, at least by means of the use of the upper ease for the former, even though it is not an absolutecriterion.
Consider:Jacques Chirac e.st le President de la FranceBill Clinton is the President of USANevertheless, the upper case does not totally satisfy our semantic intuition, since we also observenouns with the upper case, such as President or President, which certainly do not designate oneparticular person (here, we encounter the fundamental problem of the definition of the term'proper').
Likewise, in the following sentence, the noun Franqais and American started with theupper case cannot be considered as proper names, whatever the definition of proper name is:(Cet homme + Un Franqais) e.st le Prdsident de la France(This man + An American) is the President of USA2.2.
Type H < PN (Spec+E) Professional Title-(Postposition+E) >This type of sequence is characterized by the presence of nouns of professional title (PT), suchas-Wx~ bagsa \[Doctor\]~-~ gyosu \[Professor\]~ wenjang \[Director\]~0~ sajang \[President\]~r d janggwan \[Minister\]For example:Kim MinU bagsa-neun migug-eise 5nyengan gongbuha-essdaPN<Kim MinU> Doctor-Postp U.S.A.-Postp 5year-during study-Past(Dr. Kirn MinU has studied in U.S.A. during 5 years)The noun phrase in subject position: 'K /m MinU bagsaneun" is composed of three strings.However, in Korean, typographical constraint is not a reliable criterion, since we cannot prohibitwriting this phrase in other ways like:(2a) ~% ~,\]--~(2b) ~\] ~ ~,~KimMinU_ bagsaneunKimMinUbagsaneunWhen proper names occur as attached to other elements of noun phrases, their analysis becomesmore complicated.
Therefore, a local grammar recognizing PTs such as (Figure 3):Figure 3.
Local grammar of Type II276will reduce numerous mismatchings between the strings like (2b) and the combination of the itemsfound in a dictionary.Since a family name alone can precede PTs, the grammar above should be refined (Figure 4):Figure 4.
A more detailed Local grammar of Type IIThus we observe (3) instead of(l):(3) ~ ~ =1~,~t 5~ o=~r~Kim bagsa-neun migug-eise 5 nyengan gongbuha-essda(Dr. Kim has studied in the U.S.A. during 5 years)while a given name alone hardly appears with PTs:.~.~-?- ~'~,~--b ~1~1~t 5~Z~ ~?
?MinU bagsa-neun migug-eise 5 nyengan gongbuha-essda(Dr. Min U has studied in U.S.A. during 5 years)When we list the nouns of professional title, the number of PNs recognized by the local grammarpresented in Figure 4 will be increased.
Nevertheless, listing these nouns up does not guaranteeautomatically to recognize PArs, since we can come across specific nouns (Spec) inside of  thesesequences:(4) ,~ ~--  mu'~" u_.~,~\]._~.
=1~011~ 5~z~ o~-V~Ir~Kim MinU bebhag bagsa-neun migug-eise 5nyengan gongbuha-essda(Dr. of Laws Kim MinU has studied in U.S.A. during 5 years)The Specs are appropriate to PTs: we observe nouns designating scientific domains such as'physics', "biology', "mathematics', or 'literature' for the PTs like 'doctor', whereas we find anotherset of Specs for the PT'minister': ' education', 'culture ', or 'Wansfortation' for example.Notice that PTs can also appear without PNs:(bebhag +E) bagsa-ga jeil senmangbad-neun sahoijeg fiwijung-eui hana-i-da(A doctor (of Law + E) is one of the most envied social titles)-' (~ '+E)  ~1--~ ~'~ ~-~'-~ t~geu ('bebhag +E)bagsa-neun iljfig hangug-eul ddena-ssda(This doctor (of Law + E) left Korea early)Thus, in order to analyze the strin~ followed by a PT in contexts uch as (5), the system should firstlook up a lexicon of Common Nouns (and eventually a lexicon of Determiners), and if the searchfails, one could suppose that we found a proper name:(Sa)ol~ ~,1-71- ~71~ -~r~igonggyei bagsa-ga ingi-ga nop-da (Doctors of Natural Science are highly requested)(Sb)o I ~ ~x~7~ 71~ ~i gonghag bagsa-ga ingi-ga nop-da (This doctor of Science is highly requested)277(Sc)ol ~ ~'l'~ ~ 21 21- ~r4-iminu bagsa-ga ingi-ga nop-da (Doctor Lee MinU is highly requested)In (Sa), the string found with 'bagsa \[doctor\]' is a simple noun 'igonggyei \[natural science\]'; thesequence that precedes 'bagsa \[doctor\]' in (5b) is a phrase composed of a determiner 'i \[this\]' and acommon noun 'gonghag \[science\]'; the element followed by "bagsa \[doctor\]' in (5c) will not bematched with any entries of the lexicon of common nouns: only this string will then be recognizedas a proper name.The local grammar proposed so far should be completed by the description of the followingtransformation.
Let us compare (4) with (6):bebhag bagsa Kim MinU-neun migug-eise 5nyengan gongbuha-essda(Kim MinU, Dr. of Laws, has studied in U.S.A during 5 years)The sentence (6) can still be transformed into:~ ~l~oll,~-I ~ ~ ~ ~,q-olr--l-Kim MinU-neun migug-eise 5 nyengan gongbuha-n bebhag bagsa-ida(Kim MinU is a doctor of Laws who has studied in U.S.A. during 5 years)In fact, the sequence containing PTs corresponds toa simple sentence:PN W-Professional TitleW-Professional Title PNS: PN be a W-Professional Title(7a) ~ ~q- ~ ~x~(Tb)ffi ~ed ~x~ ~ ~-(7?

Type HI  <PN-(Gen+E) Family Relation-(Postposition+E) >This type of phrases contains nouns designating a family relation (FR) such as:o)~ adeul \[son\]o~x\ ]  ~ej i  \[father\]~ che \[wife\];~ sonja \[~andchild\]~ ~ myenegli \[daughter-in-law\]These nouns have a strong possibility to occur with a proper name, as shown in the followingsentence:~o_ .

Type III of norm phrases containing PNsThe strings "N-(Gen+E) FR" do not automatically guarantee xistence of proper names, sincecommon ouns that have a human feather can also appear with a FR like:(~'~ ~gd + ~:~ ~xl-)- (~ +E) oI-'~'~ -~'~ 20~?1~(bbang/ib juin+yepfib namja)-(eui+ E) adeul-eun olhai 20 sal-ida((The baker + The neighbor)'s son is 20 years-old this year)'In fact, strings containing FRs are necessarily based upon human nouns, proper names being onlyone class of human nouns.
This context helps to f'md proper names, but is not a sufficient conditionto recognize them automatically.2.4.
Type IV <PN Vocative Term-(Postposit ion+E) >We call Vocative Terms ( FT) the following utterances:,~ z~ !
yenggam !
\[Sir !\]e~ ~d !
senbainim !
\[Senior !\]~ !
nuna !
\[Elder sister !
(for a boy)\],L1 q !
enni !
\[Elder sister !
(for a girl)\]!
hyeng !
\[Elder brother !
(for a boy)\].9.~.
!
obba !
\[Elder brother !
(for a girl)\]The nouns above can all be used as FTs, that is, a term one can use to indicate some social orfamilial relations between himself (i.e.
the speaker) and his interlocutor(s), or to call on somebodypaYing due respect o his social status (honorific terms).
In addition, with proper names, they canalso occur in assertive sentences, like:Kim yenggara-i wa-ssda PN<Kixn> sir-Postp come-Past (Sir.
Kim came)Ina nuna-ga ddena-ssda PN<In A> elder sister-Postp leave-Past (Elder Sister InA left)These FTs should be compared with the nouns of professional title (PT) that we examined in section2.2.
and those of family relation (FR) mentioned in 2.3., since some of them (PTs and FRs) can alsobe used in calling someone, like in:Kim Gyosu!
(Come here !
)Kim MinU Wenjangnim !\[PT: Professor Kim !\]\[PT: Director Kim MinU !\]o~ z\] !
abeji !
\[FR: Father I\]o~ ~ q !
emeni !
\[FR: Mother !\]Let us examine differences among them:?
r. Difference between FTand PTNouns of Professional Title (P~ are different from Vocative terms (FT), not only in syntactic,but also in semantic ways.
As PTs do not have inherently vocative functions, they can hardly beused alone in the vocative case:279?
*~@ l ?
*gyosu !
\[Professor !\]?
*~d'-vd - !
?
*/anggwan !
\[Minister !\]Then, one should either attach to them a vocative suffix such as '~d him', or adjoin them to propernames:gyosu-nira!/Kim MinU gyosu!janggwan-niml/Kim janggwan!Semantically, PTs designate professions, the list of which we can determine a priori, while ITs aremore vague and non-predictable without examining pragmatic situations: the latter are closer to thenouns of Family Relation (FR), since, as mentioned above, they imply familial or social relationsbetween a speaker and his interlocutor(s).?
4.
Difference between FT and FRWhat we call nouns of Family Relation (FR) cannot appear with a proper name when they areused in the vocative case.
Thus, is not allowed the internal structure:*ProperName FamilyName !such as:(1 )*~ ~--?- o'l-~lal !?
Wo.\]~q !
*KimMinU abefi!
\[FR:Father Kim MinU\[\]*Park emeni / \[FR: Mother Park !\]Remember that FRs are formally defined as occurring in the structure 'PN-Gen FR \[Proper Name'sFR\]', thus, when we encounter them in the contexts ' IN  FR' (e.g.
:~& o\].~qa\] Kim MinU abefi\[Kim MinU\]), such strings have a meaning corresponding to 'PN-Gen FR" (e.g.
~ ~-q-al o\]-Mx\] KimMinU-eui abefi \[Kim MinU's father\]): PNs are not appositions to FR, like in sequences composed of"PN IT" such as (2).
ITs, by definition, should be able to appear directly associated with propernames.

Type V <PN Incomplete Noun-(Postposit ion+E)>This type of Noun Phrase is similar to the preceding one: what we call Incomplete Nouns (IN) isalso used for social appellation.
However, they are different from the preceding ones by the fact thatthey do not have syntactic autonomy, and therefore they never can appear alone in any positions of asentence.
Here is their list:280IIIIIIIIlIIII!lIIi.11II!

The following table represents different ypes (Figure 7)::.

+Figure 7.
Types of PNs according to INsThe table above can be represented by a Finite State Automaton (FSA) \[Lap96\], \[Gro87\] as shownin the following graph (Figure 8):Figure 8.
FSA of PN-INThese nouns (/Ns), syntactically and semantically incomplete, always require proper names to theirleft side.
In this sense, this type of contexts is appropriate to PNs: if an 1N is recognized, we can beassured to fred a PN near to it.
In spite of this strong constraint, since a l l /Ns are mono-syllabic,ambiguity problems are often hard to handle.
For example, the 1N '71.
ga \[Mr.\]' is an homograph ofseveral items.
Let us consider some of them (Figure 9):Fype Part of Speech Meaning " ExamphIncomplete N. Mr.Simple Noun grade --~@=\] ?~7}Prefix 1 dance 7}-~Prefix2 provisory 7}4 ~o ~Suffixl \[ letter ~ 71.281Suffix2Suffix3valuefamily 71.Suffix4 music -8- ~ ~1"Suff'tx5 person ~& T\]-Suffix6 boundary ~T1-Suffix7 area ~ ~- 71.Verb go ,~ q.71.

Homograph types of'ga'The following sentence illustrates this ambiguity problem:(\]) ~71- ~3~-~-~ -?-~ 71- ~ 71- ~71-  ~-~tl ~- -?-~7l-,:,.II x.~ ~ 71-~ ~_  _v_ ~ ~, ~ oo~71- ~,~bag-ga chingu-deul-gwa uli-ga muhega jutaig-ga geunche han umul-ga.eise yuhaing-ga-leul buleu-goisseul ddai, yengyang-ga ebs-neun bbangbuseulegi juwi.-ei myech mali sai-ga anja iss-ess-den-ga ?
(When we were singing popular songs with Mr. Park's friends at the edge of a well near the area ofunlicensed buildings, how many birds were there sitting around bread crumbs without any taste ?
)We observe the morpheme ga 9 times.
But only the first occurrence of ga is an Incomplete Nounwhich accompanies a PN.
In the 8 other strings, we should not expect occurrences of PNs: in orderto recognize an 1Nga, first, dictionaries of  all common ouns (i.e.
simple nouns, derived nouns, andcompound nouns) must be available.
I f  the string containing a is not found in these dictionaries,then the f'mal syllable ga might be a verb, a nominative postposition attached to a noun, or aninflectional suffix attached to a verb; or else, it is an IN ga.In the case o f  (1), strings containing a, such as the following ones, are detected as commonnouns (simple or derived ones):~ ~ 71- muhega unlicensed~ 71. jutaig-ga area of buildings~-7\]- umul-ga edge of a well~ 71. yuhaing-ga popular songse~ o~ 7~ yen~,ang-ga any tasteand the following ones are either nouns followed by a postposition ga or a verb including theinflectional suffix (IS) ga:-~ ~ 71. uli-ga we-Postpx~ 71. sai-ga bird-Postp.~.~ .
7}.
iss-ess-den-ga be-IS \[Past-Past-Interrogation\]The string '~71.
bag-ga' will not be recognized as one of these cases, even though there exists asimple noun "bag \[pumpkin\]' in the dictionary of common ouns, since the postposition required bythis noun is not '71-ga', but 'ol r .
Therefore, bag-ga will be analyzed as a proper name bag (familyname alone) followed by an INga.3.
Building Local Grammars of  PNsLet us summarize the formal definition of  the five contexts where a Proper Name (PN) can occur:IIIIIIIiIIIIIiIII282' - , ' .

Local grammar of PNsNotice that when we recognize Incomplete Nouns (i.e.
~ ssi, ~ yang, 7} ga, ~d nim, :~ gun,ong), the occurrence of proper names is guaranteed, since _/Ns cannot occur without PNs.Nevertheless, asmentioned above, serious ambiguity problems appear in the distinction of/Ns fromtheir homographs, we here propose two complex local grammars in order to increase the ratio ofidentification of/Ns.3.1.
Use of PostHN appropriate to Human NounsThere are specific items appropriate to human nouns: we name them .PostHN.
They do notconstitute autonomous units, but are attached to human nouns at the syntactic level.
Thus, theyappear even after the plural marker ~ deul \[/s/\].
For example, in the following sentences, a PostHN%il nei \['s family/house\]' appears with a PN alone, or with a PN followed by an /N (here, ~1 ssi\[Mr.\]):~417} el =\]--~*tlxt ~ql~ x l~'rq"  MinU-nei-ga imaeul-eise jeiil bujilenha-daPN<MinU>-PostHN\[farnily\]-Postp thi  village-Postp most diligent-St(MinU's family is most diligent in this village)7,~..9_a\]~lo~lx t -~o1 ~rq- GangGinO-ssi-nei-eisePN<Kang GinO>-IS\[Mr.\]-PostHN\[house\]-Postp fire-Postp occur-Past(There was a fire in Mr. Kang GinO's house)bul-i na-ssdaIn French, we observe a preposition similar to this PostHN: ehez ('s family/house), a locativepreposition, as at one ~ in English, which selects only human nouns:283f ly a eu un feu chez M. Pierre PitonThere was afire at M. Pierre PiconTherefore, when we encounter a sequence that ends with an IN-PostHN-Poalp, the possibility to finda PN is increased.
For example, the following string:~o~ 7~ !=~\]-~.
jang-ga-nei-neuncan be analyzed in 510 ways (i.e.
(7 x 7 x 5 x 2) + (2 x 5 x 2) = 510) after a simple matching of thewords of this string with their lexicon entries (Figure 11):fPN , me> IN:Mr. /<Poyn_ :, mily>/ <Nl:soysauce> <N:grade> / <PRON:you>J <N2:intestines> <Pfl::2 typ~ <Num.four><N3:marlket> <Sfi:7 ty~s> <FU:yes!><N4:chaper> <V:go>/ <IS:declarative>~5.

Accurate analysis of the string in Figure 113.2.
Snperposition of contexts for PNsLet us examine the following sentences:Kim-ssi-dong~ing-nei-jib-wun aju keu..daPN<Kim>-IN-brother-PostHN-appartment-Postp very large-St(The appartment ofMr.Kim's brother's family is very large)Kim MinU bagsa-nim-adeul-nei-eise janchi-ga yelli-essdaPN<Kim MinU>-.doctor-Sfx-son-PostHN-Postp par y-Postp occur-Past(There was a party in Dr. Kiln MinU's son's family's house)GinO hyeng-nim-nei-lo modu ga-ja !PN<GinO>-brother-Sfx-PostHN-Postp t gether go-St(Let's go together to Brother GinO's house !
)!1IIIIIIII284 !IIIIIIIIiHere, several of the noun phrases we have examined so far occur piled together.
The internalstructures of the examples above are respectively:(2a) PN- <Type I/> - <Type 111> - PostHN- Noun - Postp(2b) PN- <Type 11> - <Type III> - PostHN- Postp(2c) PN- <Type IF> - PostHN- PostpHence, by providing information about he combinations of these strings, we could rise the accuracyin recognizing PNs.
For example, the string that includes the sequence ~\]..~ z  41 ~ ssi-dongsaing-nei-j ib  in (la) can hardly be anything else than a noun phrase containing a PN.
Thus, even though we:find several entries :~ lkim in the lexicon of nouns, such as:kira 1.
Noun = steam \[e.g.
~ ol ~-  \]2.
Noun = dried laver \[e.g.
~ g\]'\]3.
Noun = hope \[e.g.
~o\] ~r.Jc \]4.
Completive Noun = chance \[e.g.
-~ ~ ~... \]we can eliminate these interpretations, since these forms precede the complex sequence that requiresnecessarily a PN.4.
Experimental resultsi So far, we have examined contexts where we expect o encounter Proper Names (PAr).
In order torecognize automatically PNs on a large scale in texts in the absence of a complete lexicon of  PNs,the description of noun phrases containing PNs should be necessary.
We constructed local grammarsbased upon our description of the types of nominal phrases containing proper names.I Notice that implementing such a system requires the use of the relation between Recall andPrecision.
In general, it is understood that Recall is the ratio of relevant documents retrieved for agiven query over the number of relevant documents for that query in a database, and Precision is theI ratio of the number of relevant documents retrieved over the total number of documents retrieved\[Fra92\].However, Recall-Precision plots show that Recall and Precision arc inversely related.
That is,I when Precision goes up, Recall typically goes down and vice-versa.
If we want to recognizeautomatically PNs in a given text in order to construct an electronic lexicon of PNs, Recall, that isthe ratio of PNs retrieved for a given grammar over the number of PNs in the text, should certainlybe higher than Precision.I Let consider results of In the contexts of i.e.
<PN us some experimental our study.
Type V,Incomplete Noun-(Postposition + E)>, the Incomplete Noun (/N) '~\] ssi \[Mr./Miss./Mrs.\]' canappear with a family name alone, a given name alone, or a full name (of.
2.5.
Figure 7).
RememberI that, in Korean, a typographical unit delimited by blanks cannot directly be taken as a basic elementfor morphological nalysis \[Nam97\]: we should then analyze the strings occurring with a blank onthe leit side of/Ns as well as the strings tuck to 1Ns in order to examine the context Type V. Thus,I the local grammar of Type V for '~q ssr  is the following graph (Figure 13):!Figure 13IIII 285Our first text was composed of 29373 characters \[Cho96\], we located 22 sequences containing ssi,20 of which are PNs (Figure 14):Figure 14In the second text, composed of 30869 characters, 69 occmrences of "X-ssi" are observed.
All "Fullname-ssi" sequences here appear attached, whereas, in the preceding text, they all appear with ablank (i.e.
7(-#-ssi').
Here is the result (Figure 15)::.Name -ssi G.Name -ssi Full Name - ssi nonPN Tota35 I 1 t 24 ' 9 i 69 'Figure 15The 9 sequences 'non-PNs" are as followings:\[1 \] ~ ~q 7\] eg-ssi-gi \[6\] o\]-7\].~\], aga-ssi,\[2\] ?~\]---~--a" ib-ssi-leumeul \[7\] :z\]\]~\]y~ jei-ssi-doineun\[3\] o\]-7}~  aga-ssi-lan \[8\] ~ ~ ~ nal-ssi-yessda\[4\] o\].y\].~\]~ aga-ssi-du \[9\] ~Y~ nal-ssi-ga\[5\] o\].y~ aga-ssi-laLooking up our dictionaries of Korean Simple Nouns (DECOS-NSN01) \[Nam94\], and of KoreanPostpositions (DECOS-POST/V01) \[Nam96b\] eliminate \[2\], \[3\], \[4\], \[5\], \[6\], \[8\], \[9\], which are thesequences composed of a common oun and a postposition (or a typographical separator such as acomma).
Because \[1\] is a dialectal adverb, and \[7\] a 'Noun-Verb' string, they were not detected inour system.The third text composed of 33982 characters contains 10 occurrences of ~'-ssi" one of which is anonPN ( ' .~-01  peulo ssi-leumi \[N/N/Postp\]') (Figure 16):Figure 16This nonPNwas eliminated after looking up the dictionary of  Postpositions: there is no postposition'~o\] leumi'.
The analysis of the text above on the basis of the local grammar presented in Figure 3(Type II <PN Spec-PT-(Posq~ + E)> ) in 2.2. allows to recognize PNs in a more satisfactory way.Besides ~-ssi" strings, with two PTs: '~-~-~ daitonglyeng \[the President\]' and '~  susa~g \[theprime minister\]', we could recognize 73 % of PNs, that is, 49 occurrences of67 (i.e.
Recall is 0.73).However, use of the local grammars of Figure 13 and Figure 3 (only with these two PTs above)leaves ome nonPNs: Precision is 0.7 (49 strings of 70 which occurred with these/N and PTs arePNs).
Since our goal is to recognize most contexts where PNs can occur, in order to consn'uct alexicon of FNs as complete as possible, Recall should be more important than Precision in oursystem.
By adding a few more PTs (cf.
Type II) such as '~--~ janggun \[general\]', '~ sensu\[player\]', FRs (cf.
Type III) such as '~l.~ bunye \[father-daughter\]', o /Ns (cf.
Type V) such as '?o zyang \[Miss.\]' in the lexicon on the basis of which our local grammars are constructed, we couldobtain a more reliable result as shown in the following table (Figure 17):i 89 ' 59Figure 17286lIIiIIIiIIIiIiiIiIIlII,IIiI" i ,-,).
,IIIIIIIII,IIIThus, Recall increases: 0.88, whereas Precision goes down: 0.66.
The 8 PNs that are not retrieved byour local grammars are given below.
Actually, their contexts are hard to determine, since they aresyntactically identical with contexts where common ?
