A Preliminary Model of Centering in Dialog*D. Byron and A. StentUniversity of Rochester Computer Science DepartmentRochester NY 14627, U.S.A.dbyron/stent@cs, rochester, eduAbstractThe centering framework explains local coherence by re-lating local focus and the form of referring expressions.It has proven useful in monolog, but its utility for multi-party discourse has not been shown, and a variety of is-sues must be tackled to adapt he model for dialog.
Thispaper eports our application of three naive models ofcentering theory for dialog.
These results will be used asbaselines for evaluating future models.
11 In t roduct ionThe centering framework (Grosz et al, 1995) is oneof the most influential computational linguistics the-ories relating local focus to the form chosen for re-ferring expressions.
A number of studies have de-veloped refinements and extensions of the theory(eg.
Brennan et al, 1987; Kameyama, 1986; Strubeand Hahn, 1996; Walker et al, 1998), but few haveattempted to extend the model to multi-party dis-course (cf.
Brennan, 1998; Walker, 1998).For dialog systems, the benefits of using cen-tering theory include improved reference resolutionand generation of more coherent referring expres-sions.
However, it is not at all clear how to adaptthe theory for multi-party discourse.
This paper ex-amines some of the issues involved in adapting thetheory, then describes the results of applying threealternative models to a corpus of 2-person dialogs.We chose very naive approximations to the originaltheory as a starting point.
These results will be abaseline for evaluating more sophisticated modelsin the future.2 The Centering modelThe centering framework (Grosz et al, 1995) makesthree main claims: 1) given an utterance Un, the* The authors would like to thank James Alien, MarflynWalker, and the anonymous reviewers for many helpful com-ments on a preliminary draft of the paper.

A partially-ordered list of forward-lookingcenters Cfn that includes all discourse ntitiesin utterance n. Its first element is the 'preferredcenter ' ,  Cpn.2.
A backward-looking center Cbn, the highestranked element of Cfn- 1 that is in Cfn.The framework defines a preference ordering ontechniques for effecting a topic change, ranked ac-cording to the inference load each places on theaddressee.
The transitions are called 'shift', 're-tain' and 'continue' and differ based on whetherCbn = Cbn+l and whether Cbn = Cpn.At the heart of the theory are two centering rules:Rule 1: If any member of Cfn is realized by a pro-noun in Cfn+l, Cbn+l must be a pronoun.Rule 2: Sequences of continues are preferred oversequences of retains, and sequences of retains arepreferred over sequences of shifts.3 Centering and multi-party discourseA variety of issues must be addressed to adapt cen-tering to two-party dialog.
They include:1.
Utterance boundaries are difficult to pin downin spoken dialog, and their determination af-fects the Cf  lists.
Just how the speaker turnsare broken into utterances has a huge impacton the success of the model (Brennan, 1998).2.
Should the dialog participants, referred to viafirst- and second-person pronouns (I/2PPs), beconsidered 'discourse ntities' and included incy?2We provide only the briefest sketch of the centering frame-work.
Readers unfamiliar with the model are referred to (Groszet al, 1995) for more details.14753.
Which utterance should be considered 'previ-ous' for locating Cfn-l: the same speaker'sprevious utterance or the immediately preced-ing utterance, regardless of its speaker?4.
What should be done with abandoned or partialutterances and those with no discourse ntities.4 Experimental methodOur data is from four randomly chosen dialogsin the CALLHOME-English corpus 3 (LDC, 1997).Table 1 describes the three models we created to ad-dress the issues described in Section 3.C f  elements Use both speakers'from I/2PPs previous utt to find Cb?
Model 1 Yes NoModel 2 No YesModel 3 No NoTable 1: The Centering ModelsIssue 1: Utterance boundaries We honoredutterance boundaries as transcribed 4, even if anutterance was a fragment properly belonging atthe end of the one preceding.
For instance, thefollowing two utterances eem as though theyshould be just one:Example  1 \[dialog 45711A ... and she called me one day whenA there was nobody in the house but her...For compound sentences, we broke each non-subordinate clause into a new utterance.
The utter-ance break added in Example 2 is indicated by/ :Example  2 \[dialog 42481A It does make a difference / like I alwaysthought formula smells kind of disgusting.Issue 2: Selection of items for Cf  Two crucialfactors in the original model are left to the algo-rithm implementer: the selection of items for Cfand their rank order?
Both are active areas of re-search.
In our models, all elements of Cf are cre-ated from nouns in the utterance.
We do not includeentities referred to by complex nominal constituentssuch as infinitives.
Associations (eg.
part/subpart)and ellipsed items are not allowed in determiningelements of Cf.
We adopted a commonly usedCf ordering: Subj > DO > IO > Other.
Linearsentence position is used to order multiple 'other'constituents.
Whether discourse participants shouldbe considered iscourse ntities is very perplexing3The dialog transcripts consisted of 614 utterances, 30 min-utes of speech.
After annotation (see issue 1 in section 4), therewere 664 non-empty utterances.4CALLHOME transcribers separated utterances at a~e aker change or a long pause, or if the semantics or syntax of language indicated the end of an utterance.from a centering viewpoint (Byron and Stent, 1998).One of our models includes entities referred to by1/2PPs in C f  and two do not.Issues 3/4: Previous utterance Empty utter-ances (containing no discourse ntities) are skippedin determining C f,.,_l.
Empty utterances includeacknowledgements and utterances like "hard toleave behind" with no explicitly mentioned objects.The dialogs were annotated for discourse struc-ture, so Un-1 is the previous utterance in the dis-course segment, not necessarily linear order.
5 Inmodel2, the highest ranked element of Cf from ei-ther the current speaker's prior utterance or the otherspeaker's previous utterance is Cb6; models l&3consider only the immediately preceding utterance.We also annotated the 'real' topic of each utter-ance, selected according to the annotator's intuitionof what the utterance is 'about'.
It must be explic-itly referred to in the utterance and can be an entityreferred to using a I/2PP.After the three models were defined, one dialogwas used to train the annotators (the authors) 7, thenthe other three were independently annotated ac-cording to the rules outlined above.
The annotatorscompared their results and agreed upon a reconciledversion of the data, which was used to produce theresults reported in Section 5.
Annotator accuracy asmeasured against he reconciled ata over all cate-gories ranged from 80% to 89%.
Accuracy was cal-culated by counting the number of utterances thatdiffered from the reconciled ata (including differ-ent ordering of C f), divided by total utterances.
85 Results and analysisTable 2 summarizes our findings.
Only 10 of 664 ut-terances violate Centering Rule 1, so centering the-ory's assumptions linking local focus to pronounsappear to hold in dialog.
It is interesting to note thatModel 1, which includes dialog participants as dis-course entities, consistently performed best in thecategories used for this evaluation.
95The authors performed segmentation together; the purposeof this study is to examine xtensions of centering theory, notdiscourse segmentation.6In case of conflict, recency takes precedence.7Annotators must not confer during annotation, so a trainingdialog is used to clarify unclear annotation instructions.
In thiscase, the annotators examined it to agree on which syntacticconstituents would contribute Cf elements and the criteria forbreaking turns into utterances.SMore standard reliability measures could not be used sincethere are no "tags" in this annotation scheme, and within somecategories there may be an ordered list of items.9But see (Byron and Stent, 1998).1476em~\[2Cb l Ub = t?picM1 M3 M1 M2 M3Dialog 1:227 utts 110 136 169 71 49 47Dialog 2:229 utts 105 174 176 87 41 38Dialog 3:208 utts 103 137 139 77 54 54I cheap transitions \[ expensive trans.M1 lVI2 M3 M1 lVI2 M394 48 47 133 144 14593 37 37 136 149 14984 58 58 114 123 123Z for all dialogs 318 467 484 235 144Model total / 664 total utts48% 70% 73% 35% 22%139 271 143 142 383 416 417transition type / total transitions21% 41% 26% 25% 59% 74% 75%Table 2: Comparison of three alternative centering models for dialog5.1 Empty Cb 'sEach of our models leaves at least 52% of non-empty utterances with no prediction of the Cb(Cfn-1 and Cfn are disjoint).

Some emptyCb's result from abrupt topic shifts, while othersoccur when the speakers make topically related, butC f-disjoint, contributions, uch as the last line in:Example 3 \[dialog 48611A I just want to figure out what I'm going to do withmy life.
I feel like I'm never going to figure it out.B Lizzy, you might not.B I haven't figured out mine yet.In many cases, a Cb would exist if we modified themodels to include associated and ellipsed entitiesin Cf.
For instance, in Example 4, the ellipsedlocation in A's utterance should be the Cb:, Example 4 \[dialog 42481B ... Ive been there walt, yes three times I thinkA Well this is our second time5.2 Cb Matches the 'real' topicFor utterances where a Cb can be selected, itmatches the 'real' topic only 21% to 35% ofthe time.
By this measure, our models are poorpredictors of local focus.
For instance, in Example5, the 'real' topic of the first utterance is Jackson,but according to Modell the set of entities referredto by "we" is the Cb of both utterances.Example 5 \[dialog 42481A And like we went into Jackson, the town and /we were like - AAAHHHI let me out of hereThe annotators' intuitions regarding the 'real'topic often conflicted.
It would be interesting to an-notate actor and discourse focus separately, then seewhich one the Cb most closely matches.5.3 Cheap versus expensive transitionsStrube and Hahn (1996) propose a method of eval-uating a model against centering rule 2, measuringthe 'cost' of the listener's inference load.

Allthree of our models produced a very low percentof cheap transitions in this experiment, especiallywhen compared to Strube and Hahn's result of 80%.6 Conclusions and Future workWe conclude that centering behavior in dialog isconsistent with that found in monolog.
However,the utility of our preliminary models is question-able.
By revising our Model 1, we believe a usefulmodel of centering in dialog can be built.This study indicates many promising directionsfor future research.
Some we intend to pursue are:?
Evaluate the models using other criteria, e.g.improved pronoun resolution.?
Experiment with alternate C f orderings andimprove the semantic theory to include entitiesreferred to by personal pronouns, associationsand ellipsed entities in Cf.?
