This datamigration effort is in keeping with the vi-sion of a Semantic Web; it is part of an ef-fort to build a ?community of practice?around semantically rich linguistic re-sources.1 IntroductionMachine-readable structured linguistic docu-ments (comparative word lists, lexicons, annotatedtexts, audio and audio-video recordings alignedwith transcriptions (possibly annotated), gram-matical descriptions, etc.)
are being made availablein a wide variety of formats on the Web.
Until re-cently, the linguistics community has not been par-ticularly concerned about the ease with whichthose structures can be accessed by other users, norabout the comparability of the structures that canbe accessed.
Now that community is beginning torealize that XML encoding provides relativelystraightforward access to the intended structuresand at the same time insures that the documentswill continue be accessible for the foreseeable fu-ture.However, XML encoding by itself does not in-sure comparability.
To achieve that goal, the com-munity must either adopt standards for encodingparticular structures, or methods need to be devel-oped for interpreting structures that are differentlyencoded.
This paper reports on an effort to do thelatter: to migrate XML documentation of linguisticstructure to a semantically interoperable format.One of the most compelling reasons to do so is toenable intelligent search: the ability to querydocuments based on their semantics, rather than onstrings of characters that may occur in them or ontheir document syntax.
Facilitating intelligentsearching is also one of the major goals of the Se-mantic Web.
We are making the first steps towardsa Semantic Web for linguistics by showing how tomigrate a significant amount of language resourcesto a format that makes them semantically compa-rable.2 BackgroundThe work reported in this paper was carried outas part of the Electronic Metastructure for Endan-gered Language Data (EMELD) project[emeld.org] (NSF grant 0094934) and the Data-Driven Linguistic Ontology project (NSF grant0411348).
One of the objectives of the EMELDproject is the ?formulation and promulgation ofbest practice in linguistic markup of texts and lexi-con.?
Underlying this objective is the goal of en-suring that the digital language documentationproduced by linguists will be truly portable in thesense of Bird and Simons (2003): that it will tran-scend computer environments, scholarly communi-ties, domains of application, and the passage oftime.
The project was undertaken on the basis ofthe following principles:1.2.3.1.2.3.4.1.2.3.XML markup provides the best format forthe interchange and archiving of endangeredlanguage description and documentation.No single schema or set of schemas forXML markup can be imposed on all lan-guage resources.The resources must nevertheless be compa-rable for searching, drawing inferences, etc.Simons (2003) points out the conflict betweenthe second and third principles, and describes thefollowing set of actions for reconciling them.Develop a community consensus on sharedontologies of linguistic concepts that canserve as the basis for interoperation.Define the semantics of any particularmarkup schema by mapping its elements andattributes to the concepts in the shared on-tology that they represent.Map each individual language resource ontoits (partial) semantic interpretation by apply-ing the mapping of its markup schema.Perform queries and other knowledge-basedoperations across resources over these se-mantic interpretations rather than the origi-nal XML documents.The EMELD project has already begun work onthe first of these action items, the creation of asharable ontology for language documentation anddescription, a General Ontology for Linguistic De-scription (GOLD) [emeld.org/gold] (Farrar andLangendoen, 2003), which is intended to begrounded in a suitable upper ontology such asSUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) or DOLCE (Ma-solo et al, 2002).
GOLD is itself being written inOWL, the Ontology Web Language (McGuinnessand van Harmelen, 2004), for use in Semantic Webapplications.
Simons (2003, 2004) also provides a?proof of concept?
for an implementation of theremaining three action items as follows.Beginning with three dictionaries that usedsimilar but distinct markup based on theText Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines(Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2002),Simons created mappings from their differ-ent markup schemas to a common semanticsas defined by an RDF Schema (Brickley andGuha, 2004).
Such a semantic schema pro-vides a ?formal definition ... of the conceptsin a particular domain, including types of re-sources that exist, the properties that can re-late pairs of resources, and the propertiesthat can describe a single resource in termsof literal values?
(Simons, 2004).
This map-ping he called a metaschema, a formal defi-nition of how the elements and attributes ofa markup schema are to be interpreted interms of the concepts of the semanticschema.
He called the ?language?
for writingmetaschemas (defined via an XML DTD) aSemantic Interpretation Language (SIL).Simons performed the semantic interpreta-tion operation in a two-step process usingXSLT, first to create an interpreter for a par-ticular metaschema and then to apply itagainst a source document to yield the RDFdocument (repository) that is its semantic in-terpretation.Simons then loaded the RDF repositoriesinto a Prolog system to create a merged da-tabase of RDF triples and used Prolog?s in-ference engine to query the semantic inter-pretations.Simons (2003) describes this implementation asproviding a semantics of markup, rather than asdevising yet another markup language for seman-tics.
As such, it is in the spirit of efforts such asSperberg-McQueen et al (2000), who define themeaning of markup as the set of inferences li-censed by it.
However, their model does not pro-vide for the general comparison of documents.
It isalso in the spirit of the proposal for a LinguisticAnnotation Framework (LAF) under developmentby Working Group 1-1 of ISO TC 37 SC 4[www.tc37sc4.org] (Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide,Romary and de la Clergerie, 2003), but differsfrom it in some significant ways.
For example, ourstrategy does not require that the source annota-tions be mapped to an XML ?pivot format?.
On theother hand, the LAF does not require that thesource annotations be in XML to begin with.
The?data categories?
of the LAF correspond to theconcepts in GOLD; however the ?creation of anontology of annotation classes and types?
is not yetpart of the LAF (Ide, Romary and de la Clergerie2003).
Moreover, the LAF data model is confinedto feature structures, whereas GOLD plans to offerfeature structures as one of several data structuringalternatives.
Finally, through its connection withan upper ontology, GOLD will also be related tothe ?rest of the world?, whereas the LAF ontologyis apparently intended for linguistic structure only.3 Goals of this paperIn this paper we extend Simons?
proof of con-cept for the use of metaschemas in the followingways.1.2.3.4.GOLD itself is used as the semantic schema.SIL is extended to include the ability to mapthe content of designated elements and at-tributes in source documents to the semanticschema, not just the markup itself.We devise metaschemas for lexicons thatuse distinct XML markup schemas: one ofthe lexicons that Simons (2003) originallyused, for Sikaiana (Solomon Islands) withabout 3000 entries; a Hopi (Arizona) dic-tionary with about 30,000 entries, for whichKenneth Hill?s original encoding using aproprietary and no longer supported data-base program was converted to XML byLewis and Gonzalez; and a Potawatomi(Great Lakes region, US and Canada) lexi-con being created by Laura Buszard-Welcher using the EMELD FIELD tool.The Prolog query engine is replaced bySeRQL, an SQL-like query language forSesame, an RDF database program (Broek-stra, Kampman and van Harmelen 2002;User Guide for Sesame 2004).
It is our in-tention to couple Sesame with an inferenceengine that reads OWL documents, such asRacer (Haarslev and Moller 2001).In carrying out the migration of such languageresources to the Semantic Web, we are guided bythe principle of preserving the original analyses asmuch as possible.
At the same time, since the mi-grated resources are to be rendered mutually inter-operable and transparent to the tools that are de-signed to work over them, the migration processhas the potential to greatly increase the precisionof the original analyses, to reveal inconsistenciesin them, and ultimately to result in enriched re-sources.
For example, the comparison of two de-scriptions of the same language that has been madepossible by migration could reveal errors in one orthe other.
Similarly, a single resource could bechecked for consistency with accumulated linguis-tic knowledge represented in an ontology.
The mi-gration process thus provides two sources of newknowledge.
First is the knowledge brought in fromthe document interpretation process itself, i.e.
bythe linguist, not necessarily the one who performedthe original analysis.
Second when the migrateddocuments are added to the knowledge base, newinferences can be automatically generated based onthe general knowledge of linguistics captured inthe ontology.
The type of new knowledge gener-ated is however constrained, for example, by thetype of search to be done over the resulting knowl-edge base (see section 6).However the migration process can also skew ormisinterpret the intentions underlying the originaldocumentation.
To minimize this risk, the migra-tion tools should be as non-intrusive as possible.Even so, some steps are necessary to add structurewhere structure is lacking in the original XMLdocumentation and to interpret the meaning of theoriginal elements where their meanings are unde-fined or unclear.
For the ontology the implicationis that theory-laden concepts either should beavoided or less encumbered alternatives should bemade available.4 GOLDAn important guiding principle used in the con-struction of GOLD is to distinguish between thoseconcepts that represent the content of linguisticdata and those that pertain to the structuring ofthose data (cf.
Ide and Romary 2003 who also dis-tinguish between data content and data structure).A particular entry in a lexicon, for example, is adata structure used to organize lexical data in aparticular fashion.
Entries usually contain actualdata instances, e.g., the Hopi word nahalayvi?ymaor its phonological properties.
The process of datamigration is made much easier if a separation be-tween data and data structure is upheld in the se-mantic schema.4.1 Data contentLinguistic data content includes linguistic ex-pressions, the physical manifestations of language,also known as ?morphs?, or simply ?forms?, whichmay be written, spoken or signed.
In GOLD, writ-ten linguistic expressions are represented asORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION with the subclassesORTHOGRAPHICPART, ORTHOGRAPHICWORD, andORTHOGRAPHICSENTENCE.
These are defined asspecial types of strings.
In order to analyze linguis-tic data further, abstract counterparts of linguisticexpressions are proposed called LINGUISTICUNIT.The abstract units are the main objects of interestin formal linguistics.
In some theories, the varioussubclasses of LINGUISTICUNIT correspond to?morphemes?, ?constituents?, or ?constructions?.
Noassumptions are made about whether these haveany mental significance, e.g.
whether they are un-derlying forms.
The class hierarchy forLINGUISTICUNIT is presented in Farrar, Lewis andLangendoen (2002), and can be viewed in GOLDusing Prot?g?
2.0 [protege.stanford.edu].The LINGUISTICUNIT hierarchy is organized ac-cording to how its components are realized asforms, and not according to their formal linguisticfeatures, which are theory specific.
So, for exam-ple, LEXICALUNIT is simply a formal unit that canappear in isolation in its realized form, and notnecessarily something that can be a constituent oflarger syntactic constructions.
The methodologyleaves open the question of whether, for example,a SUBLEXICALUNIT can also be a phrasal constitu-ent, as appears to be the case with CLITIC.
Yet an-other alternative would be to organize LINGUISTIC-UNIT according to semantic features, e.g., aSUBLEXICALUNIT would be something which usu-ally represents a grammaticized notion.
But, sincethis varies from language to language, a differenttaxonomy would be needed for every type of lan-guage encountered.
To sum up, adhering to strictlyformal features necessitates theory-specific tax-onomies, while adhering to semantic features leadsto language-specific taxonomies.
Instead a neutralapproach is taken in which LINGUISTICUNIT is or-ganized according to how instances are realized aslinguistic expressions.ORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION is related to LIN-GUISTICUNIT by the predicate REALIZES.
The par-ticular sort of LINGUISTICUNIT is further definedaccording to what kinds of attributes it can take.So, a MORPHOSYNTACTICUNIT has attributes ofthe sort MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE.
Instancesof particular attributes are PASTTENSE, SINGULAR-NUMBER, and PROGRESSIVEASPECT.
The class ofattributes pertaining to linguistic units parallelsother kinds of non-linguistic attributes such asSHAPEATTRIBUTE and PHYSICALSTATE.There are several varieties of attributes whichlinguists find useful for language description, in-cluding phonological and semantic features.
Se-mantic attributes contrast with morphosyntacticattributes in that the former correspond to the no-tional characteristics of linguistic form that havesome manifestation in the grammar.4.2 Data structuresA linguistic data structure is defined as an ab-stract information container which provides a wayto package elements of linguistic data.
The twomain types of data structures contained in GOLDat the moment are LEXICALITEM and FEATURE-STRUCTURE.
Our characterization of LEXICALITEMextends that of Bell and Bird (2000).
At a mini-mum, a LEXICALITEM should contain an instanceof LEXICALUNIT or of SUBLEXICALUNIT.
Specialrelations are given in GOLD which pertain only todata structures, e.g., HASLEXICALUNIT relates aLEXICALITEM to a LEXICALUNIT.
Instances ofLEXICALITEM typically include glosses either inthe same language in the case of a monolinguallexicon, or in some other language in the case of abilingual lexicon.
Glosses are simply instances ofORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION related to the entryvia the relation GLOSS.
Entries relate to one an-other via relations such as SYNONYMOF andANTONYMOF.If a LEXICALITEM contains extensive morpho-logical information, we may represent this in theform of a FEATURESTRUCTURE.
The FEATURE-STRUCTURE class is part of a more extensive set ofdata structures known as a FEATURESYSTEM (Lan-gendoen and Simons, 1995; Maxwell, Simons andHayashi, 2002).
A FEATURESPECIFICATION is adata structure that contains a subclass and an in-stance of MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE (i.e.
anordered pair), for example, [TENSE: PASTTENSE].The implementation of the FEATURESYSTEM con-struct allows for recursive FEATURESPECIFICA-TIONs in which, for example, a subclass ofMORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE is paired with aninstance of FEATURESTRUCTURE.One criticism that could be raised against the in-clusion of data structures in a semantic resourcesuch as GOLD is that they are superfluous.
Whynot simply leave it up to the source markup to de-scribe the elements of data structure, e.g., in theform of an XML Schema?
This is certainly a rea-sonable criticism, since excluding data structuresfrom GOLD would make the ontological model-ling process much simpler.
However, they are in-cluded because we envision that subsequent appli-cations will need to be able to reason, not onlyabout the data itself, but also about how it is struc-tured.
For example, it might be necessary to com-pare elements of a LEXICALITEM to that ofFEATURESTRUCTURE.
This is actually an essentialstep in achieving the vision of the Semantic Web,namely, constraining the source data in such a wayas to preserve structure where structure is definedand to enrich structure where structure is left un-specified.5 Semantic Interpretation LanguageThe Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL) wasoriginally created to define the meaning of theelements and attributes declared in an XMLmarkup schema, as well as the relationships be-tween them.
An SIL metaschema is an XMLdocument that formally maps the elements andattributes of an XML encoded resource to conceptsin an OWL ontology or an RDF Schema.
Further-more, the metaschema formally interprets theoriginal markup structure by declaring what thedominance and linking relations in the XMLdocument structure represent.
For example, con-sider the extract from the Hopi lexicon shown inFigure 1.The dominance relation between the elements<MSI> (for ?morphosyntactic information?)
and<POS> (for ?part of speech?)
in the original XMLis implicitly something like ?has?.
This can bemade more explicit by mapping it to HAS-MORPHOSYNTACTICPROPERTY, a formally definedrelation in the ontology.
This relation is formallydefined in the ontology by specifying its signature,i.e.
what kinds of arguments it can take.
Thus, abetter defined, more exact, relationship betweenelements of markup is achieved.<Lexeme id="L3"><Headword>naheva</Headword><MSI><POS><Feature name = "type">vt</Feature></POS>Figure 1.
Extract from Hopi LexiconSIL has been extended to formalize the resolu-tion of content in addition to markup.
For example,the semantics of the gram vt in the XML structure<POS>vt</POS> can be specified via a mappingto the ontology as an instance of VERB-TRANSITIVE, in addition to defining the semanticsof the POS element itself.An SIL metaschema, as described in detail inSimons (2004), is an XML document built frommetaschema directives, which are essentially proc-essing instructions expressed as XML elements.Directives like resource, property, lit-eral and translate generate elements of theresulting semantic interpretation.
Part of the SILDTD is shown in Figure 2.<!ELEMENT metaschema (namespace+,(interpret | ignore)+)><!ELEMENT namespace (#PCDATA)><!ATTLIST namespace prefix CDATA#REQUIRED><!ELEMENT interpret (resource |translate | property |literal)*><!ATTLIST interpret markup CDATA#REQUIRED><!ELEMENT resource (property |translate | literal | embed)*><!ATTLIST resource concept CDATA#REQUIRED><!ELEMENT property (resource |resourceRef | embed)><!ATTLIST property concept CDATA#REQUIRED><!ELEMENT translate EMPTY><!ATTLIST translate concept CDATA#REQUIRED mapping CDATA#REQUIRED>Figure 2.
SIL DTD fragmentThe interpret directive performs the pri-mary mapping function from markup elements ofthe input resource to the enriched output, as dem-onstrated in Figure 3.
The tag <form> is inter-preted as a LINGUISTICFORM, specifically as anORTHOGRAPHICREPRESENTATION of that form.Input document:<form>ahali</form>Metaschema directive:<interpret markup="form"><property concept ="gold:form"><resource concept ="gold:LinguisticForm"><literal concept ="gold:orthographicRepresentation"/></resource></property></interpret>Interpretation (output):<gold:form><gold:LinguisticForm><gold:orthographicRepresentation>ahali</gold:orthographicRepresentation></gold:LinguisticForm></gold:form>Figure 3.
Example interpretation of an elementOf primary importance to the interpretation ofcontent is the translate directive, as shown inFigure 4.
In this example, the tag <Featurename="type">, embedded within <POS>, isinterpreted as referencing a morphosyntactic prop-erty, the value of which is content interpretable bythe terminology set identified by the referenceHopi/Hopi_pos_mapping.xml.
A terminol-ogy set contains a simple mapping between termsused in the source document and the names of theequivalent concepts in the ontology.
SIL can han-dle both one-to-one terminology mappings (e.g.,mapping from the tag vt to the concept VERB-TRANSITIVE) as well as one-to-many mappings(e.g.
mapping from 1sg to a property bundle ofFIRSTPERSON and SINGULARNUMBER).Input document:<POS><Feature name = "type">vt</Feature></POS>Metaschema directive:<interpret markup = "POS/Feature[@name='type']"><translate concept ="gold:property" mapping ="Hopi/Hopi_pos_mapping.xml"/></interpret>Interpretation (output):<gold:property rdf:resource ="emeld.org/gold#VerbTransitive"/>Figure 4.
Example interpretation of contentSIL is designed to allow interoperability be-tween resources by mapping the different struc-tures and content of markup in the source docu-ments onto the same set of ontological concepts.This is demonstrated by comparing the trans-formed output for Hopi shown in Figure 4 with thetransformed output for Sikaiana in Figure 5.
Notethat the inputs are different but the outputs are thesame.Input document:<pos>Verbt</pos>Metaschema directive:<interpret markup="pos"><translate concept ="gold:property" mapping ="SKY/SKY_pos_mapping.xml"/></interpret>Interpretation (output):<gold:property rdf:resource ="emeld.org/gold#VerbTransitive"/>Figure 5.
Transformed Sikaiana <pos>The SIL only guarantees interoperability whencomparable semantic resources are employed inthe mapping.
If an entire group relies on a commonsemantic schema, e.g.
GOLD, a ?community ofpractice?
is formed.
This in turn facilitates intelli-gent search across converted resources.Currently, writing an SIL metaschema is doneentirely by hand.
We are in the process, however,of developing two tools to automate the process.The first tool will allow the user to define the rela-tionship between the terminology used within aresource with relevant GOLD concepts.
The sec-ond tool will define the structural mapping rela-tionship between the resource and a given meta-structure.
The first tool, named Alchemy, presentsthe user with a drag-and-drop interface in whichthe user defines the terms used within her resourceby associating them with one or more GOLD con-cepts.
The relationship between any given termand relevant GOLD concepts can be complex, withone-to-one or one-to-many relationships being al-lowed, and the relationships themselves can be ofany of a number of types: SameAs, KindOf, etc.We are in the process of building this tool, embed-ded within an systems developer toolkit accompa-nying GOLD.The second as of yet unnamed tool is still in theearly design stages.
This tool will allow the user tofirst define the type of resource she is converting(lexicon, interlinear text, grammar, etc.
), and willthen lead her through a series of questions that de-fine the structure by associating it with a meta-typedefinition for the particular resource type.
The toolwill require a precise and well-defined ?semanticsof linguistic structure?, a conceptual space of lin-guistic structural types that will be included inGOLD, but is still in the process of being defined.The final output of this tool, in association with anAlchemy-defined terminology set, will be an SILmetaschema.6 Querying ResourcesIn this section, we discuss the general issue ofsearching over linguistic descriptions on the Web,and the current state of our effort to do so usingSeRQL (see section 3 item 4) over the RDF reposi-tories for Sikaiana, Hopi and Potawatomi gener-ated by the metaschemas from their XML-encodedlexicons.6.1 Dimensions of search over linguistic de-scriptionsAs mentioned in section 1 above, one of themost compelling reasons to migrate XML docu-mentation to a semantically interoperable format isto enable intelligent search.
For the linguisticscommunity, we envision several parameters ofsearch over semantically interoperable linguisticdocumentation.
Search may be performed accord-ing to:?
level of analysis (phonetic, morphosyntactic,discourse)?
typological dimension (including languagetype)?
intent of search (for exploring some particu-lar language, or for language comparison)?
kind of results desired (which data structureto return)Search also varies according to degree of diffi-culty, that is, whether search requires the assis-tance of an inferencing engine or not.
Directsearch is defined as search over explicitly repre-sented data, i.e.
instance data in the knowledgespace.
This includes the simple string matching ofconventional search engines.
But since the searchwill be carried out using the enriched RDF frame-work, direct search is not limited to string match-ing in the original XML.
An example of directsearch is to find all data that includes a reference toinstances of some grammatical category (e.g.,PASTTENSE).
Boolean searching with direct searchis also possible, e.g., searching for cases of port-manteau morphemes, expressed in our frameworkas two or more MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTESassociated with some LINGUISTICUNIT.Indirect search goes beyond direct search bymaking use of inferences based on the structuringof the concepts in an ontology.
For example theconcept of PLURALNUMBER means ?two or more?,the concept of DUALNUMBER means ?exactly two?,and the concept of MULTALNUMBER means ?threeor more?.
A direct search for PLURALNUMBER willmiss those instances represented as DUALNUMBERand MULTALNUMBER, whereas an indirect searchwill find them.6.2 Some SeRQL queriesIn Figure 6, we give the SeRQL query (omittingusing namespace) for the orthographic formsfor all the lexical items specified as having theGOLD concept PROGRESSIVEASPECT in the threelexicons.
This query returned 1135 results, all fromHopi.select distinct Rfrom {LI} <gold:meaning> {}<gold:grammar> {}<gold:property>{<gold:ProgressiveAspect>},{LI} <gold:form> {}<gold:orthographicRepresentation> {R}Figure 6.
SeRQL query forPROGRESSIVEASPECT formsNext, the query in Figure 7 returns all the gram-matical properties of lexical items categorized asNOUNs in each of the lexicons.
There were 21 re-sults from Hopi, 3 from Sikaiana and 6 fromPotawatomi; an example for each language isgiven in Figure 8.
The fact that certain itemscategorized as NOUNs in Sikaiana are alsocategorized as VERBs indicates that those itemshave both classifications.
In Figure 9, we give theSeRQL query for all such items; 61 results wereobtained.select distinct P, LCfrom {LI} <gold:meaning> {}<gold:grammar> {MSI}<gold:property>{<gold:Noun>};<gold:property> {P},{LI} <gold:languageCode> {LC}where P != <gold:Noun>Figure 7.

Sample results of query in Figure 7select distinct LIfrom {LI} <gold:meaning> {}<gold:grammar> {}<gold:property> {<gold:Noun>};<gold:property> {<gold:Verb>}Figure 9.
SeRQL query for all lexical itemsmarked as both NOUN and VERBFinally in Figure 10, we give a query used tofind the parts of speech that are common to entriesin the Hopi and Sikaiana lexicons.
Four resultswere returned, NOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVE andNUMERAL.select distinct Pfrom {LI} <gold:meaning> {}<gold:grammar> {}<gold:property> {P},{LI2} <gold:meaning> {}<gold:grammar> {}<gold:property> {P},{LI} <gold:languageCode> {LC},{LI2} <gold:languageCode>{LC2}where LC = "HOP" AND LC2 = "SKY"Figure 10.
SeRQL query for common parts ofspeech in two lexiconsMore complex queries that take advantage of thestructure of the ontology are also possible, for ex-ample to find all the verbs in the lexicons regard-less of whether they have been tagged as transitiveverbs, intransitive verbs, or simply as verbs.
Withfurther development of the method described here,much more elaborate queries over much larger lin-guistic data repositories will be possible.
This re-sult, we hope, will encourage much more wide-spread distribution of language resources on theWeb and the creation of a large community ofpractice that uses those resources for research,teaching, and language revitalization efforts.ReferencesJ.
