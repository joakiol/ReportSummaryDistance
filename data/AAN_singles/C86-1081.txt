A LOGICAL FORMALISM FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF DETERMINERS fBarbara Di Eugenio~ Leonardo Lesmo, Paolo Pogliano,Pietro Torasso, Francesco UrbanoDipart imento di Informatica - Universita'  di Tor inoVia Valperga Caluso 37 ~ 10125 Torino ~ ItalyABSTRACTDeterminers play an important role in conveying the meaning ofan utterance, but they have often been disregarded, perhapsbecause it seemed more i~portant to devise methods to grasp theglobal meaning of a sentence, even if not in a precise way.Another problem with determiners is their inherent a~bigulty.In this paper we propose a logical formaliem, which, amongother things, is suitable fc~ representing determiners withoutforcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is stillnot clear.INTRODUCTIONAmbiguity of determiners is one of the most striking phenomenaof natural language; what is strange is the case with ~hich humansuse them: it seems that the molteplicity of interpretations of ancun phrase including a determiner is not explicitly perceived byhuman users of rmtural language \[Hobbs 1983\].
The approach wechose tries to model this behavier: each determiner has a charac ~teristic semantic interpretation, which is different from that ofot\]qer determiners and which can be furtherly specified an thebasis of the information contents gathered from the overall ean ~text and frfxn the remsining part of the sentence.
If such aninformation contents is rot sufficient, then the meaning of thedeterminer remains ambiguous.
What is of paramount i~rtance isthat any determiner has a "single" meaning, that can be furtherlyspecified by the context.Of course, we need to express the se~sntics of determiners bymeans of a suitable representation.
The one that we propose seemsto be intuitively acceptable, formally precise and suitable for acm~positional analysis of natural language that, even if questien -able in some particular cases, is still one of the approaches thatguarantee the most reasonable degree of generality in semanticinterpretation.It is obvious that the representation of a sentence in such afon~sliem may contain ambiguities; therefore a further step isneeded in order to obtain an unambigtmus deep specification of itsmeaning.
Contrarily to the intermediate logical formalism we aregoing to discuss, this firml specification will rot be given indeclarative form, but in terms of operations on an underlyingknowledge base.REPRESENTATION FORMALISMCt~ main goals in designing the representation formalism thatwill be used in the following sections were:I ) To maintain a close relationship between the pieces of informs-tion that are intuitively present in the input sentence and thepredicates appearing in its interpretation.2) To make explicit the distinction between surface objects andsemantic entities: words on one side and concepts, individuals,classes etc.
on the other.3) To maintain a co~i t iona l  analysis of language, where thestarting point is provided by the dependency tree built by therule~bassd syntactic cogent  of the FIDO system \[Le~no,Torasso 84; Les~o, Torasso 85a; Lesmo, Toraseo 85b\].+ Partially supported by MPI Project "Architetture Software perSistemi Intelligenti"Supported by a fellowship of CSI Pienmnte3444) To devise a set of predicates allowing an easy translationbetween the obtained representation and the correspondingoperations cn a Knowledge Base.A first example concerns a very simple sentence:I) Bob loves Lucy.The representation is (lower case strings refer to variables;upper case ones to constants or predicates):Ir) REF(S,x,BOB) & REF(S,y,LOVE) & RFF(S,z,LUCY) & AG~F(y,x) &OBJECT(y,z)This can be read as: there are three internal entities (x,y,z);the speaken (S) is referring to the first of them by using theword BOB, to the second with TO LOVE, to the third with LUCY; theagent of y is x, its obiect is z. Fig.1 depicts, in terms of nodesand arcs, the proposed representation.
REF predicates are meant toindicate the mapping between words and internal nodes.
Considernow ex.2:2) The boy loves a girlThe representation reported below disregards the information con ~tents gathered from the determiners:2r) REF(S,x,BOY) & REF(S,y,LOVE) & R\[F(S,y,GIRL) & A(~r(y,x) &OBJECT(y, z)The representation is analogous to the previous one.
On the otherhand, some problems arise in this case; they concern the com~uni~eative impact of ex.2, and which were not evident in the previousexan~)le.
If we say "Bob loves Lucy", we assume that whoever hearsthis sentence knows both Bob and Lucy, so that he is able toreconstruct the right semantic interpretation, and to identify thespecific individuals to whom the speaker is referring.
But howcan the hearer convey such kind of informmtion when explicit namesare not available?
And, on the opposite side, how can the speakertell the hearer that he is not referring to any specific indivi-dual, but he wants to mention a general property of the class?
Webelieve that the discriminating information is carried by deter-miners.
If we take them into account, we should state that ex.2expresses something as: "BOY (this word should suffice for yca toidentify whom I'm talking about) LOVES GIRL (this word is notspecific enough to allow you to identify the correct referent)"or, if we think of a knowledge base represented as a semantic net ~work: "Dear hearer, you should find a node satisfying the 'BOY'description (and if ysu consider the context, this can be doneunambiguously), then yca should create a new node of type 'GIRL'and connect them via a nede which is an 'ACT~OF 'LOVE' "CONUEP~ NET~ "THING"SS - i ~ ~ OBJ- -~ ,  \IS-A ~ \ IS-A \\ ACT-OFBOBLUCYTO LOVESURFACE WORDSINSTANCE NETfig.lWe 'can give now the complete representation of ex.2:2r' ) RFF(S,x,BOY) & IDENTIFIABLE(S,S,x) & ENABLESAF~REF(S,H,BOY)& REF(S,y,LOVE) & REF(S,z,GIRL) & IDENTIFIABLE(S,S,z) andnot ENABII~AMF~,'(S,H,GIRL) & AGF/~\]'(y,x) & OBJECT(y,z)that is: "The .~)eaker is referring to entity x by ~eans of the~rd  BOY, he assumes that x is identifiable to himself and thatthe description used (BOY) enables the hearer to refer to the sameentity; there Ls also an act of loving (y) and another entity (z)what\] he is referring to by means of the word GIRL; z is identifi-able to himself, but the word GIRL will not enable the hearer torefer to the same entity he is thinking about.
Finally, x is theagent of y and z is the object of y".Actually, 2r' does not correspond exactly to sentence 2.
Infact Ex.2 is mrbiguous whilst 2r' is not.
The source of ambiguityis the NP "a girl".
In the previous discussions we.
assumed thatthe speaker knows the girl loved by "the boy", but this is notnecessarily true.
Tne "specific" reading is given in 2r' by thepresence of the predicate IDENTIFIABLE(S,S,z).
Now, how can weaccount for the inherent ambiguity of the indefinite determiner?Simply droppi~ from its sei&nntics the "IDENTIFIABLE" prcdicate:it will be added in case the context provides m~fficient clues toinfer the "specific" interpretation, or its negation ("not IDEN =TIFIABLE") will be added in case some evidence about a "generic"interpretetion is available.
No predicate is added (and the sen ~-tence remains a~bi\[~ous, as it actually is) if no disambign~atingcriterium is provided by the context.the approach exemplified above will be de~.~ribed in the nextsection, covering the definite and Jndef\]nite determiners.
Thepredicates used are listed below, together with an explanation oftheir intuitive meaning.REF(x,y,z): Individual x is able to refer to eatity y by by meansof expression z.ENABLESAMERI.Im(x,y,z): Ir~\]ividual x assures that individual y isable to identify, by i~eans of expression z, the s~me entitywhich he refers to.IDENTIFIABLE(x,y,z): Individual x assumes that individual y isable to identify (or that y knows) entity z.Sl~2(x): Entity x is a set composed of at least t~c elements.ARBITRARY(x,z) : Any member of the class x identified by be expres-sion z necessarily satisfies the property expressed by the pro ~position in which z occurs.REPRFSFN?ATION CF DEI~ERMINERSWe wi\] 1 de~.ribe ~ne representations we have adopted for deter-miners, fell.owing the classification introduced in \[Croft 85\],which we.
report here (note, however, that the ARBITRARY predicateintroduced above does not correspond to 'arbitrary' in Croft'sc\]assification, only to its 'not defeasible' subclass):Pereeptual\]y available (this,that)- Not percept~ally available:Identifiable (the, anaphoric pronouns)Not identifiable:'-- Spnoific (specific, epistemic a)Arbitrary:.... Defeasible (generic / intensional a)~ '~ Not defeasible (any)Table I lists the various representations we have adopted, b)t usconsider first the definite determiners (we are not going to dis-cuss what Enoft refers to as 'perceptually available'-referentdeterminers, i.e.
de~mstratives like 'this' and 'that').Tne representation for 'the' reported in table I can be para"phrased as: "there exists an entity that the speaker is able torefer to by ma~s of the expression following the determiner; thespeaker asam~s that that expression will enable the hearer torefer to the ~me entity; the speaker is ~ le  to identiDI thereferred entity".
An example is provided by3) I1 ragazzo mangia (The boy is eating)3r) REF(S,x,BOY) & ENABLESAF~REF(S,H,BOY) & IDENTIFIABLE(S,S,x)& REF(S,y,TO EAT) & A .C6lJT(y,x)It ~st  be noted that it is not written anywhere that the entity xhas to be m~ individual.
In principle, it could be a genericentity (i.e.
an 'intensional' node of a semantic not), thus ful-filling the role of 'prototype individual' \[Grosz, Jo~qni, ~ in~stein 83\].A few ~rds  now to discuss plurals.
For example:4) I ragazzi mangiano (The boys are eating)4r) REF(S,x,BOY) & ~NABLESAF~_,'.REF(SjI,BOY) & IDEN?IFIABLE (S,S,x)& R~(S,y,TO RAT) & AGENT(y,x) & SEIT(X)The enly difference is the presence of the predicate SET2(x),~hich states that the entity x is a set.
We use the r~ SEF2 toevidentiate that it refers to the pretheoretical notion of set as'a group' ca~posed by mere than ore element.As regards indefinite determiners, the representations given inTable I can be paraphrased as: "There is an entity that thespeaker is able to refer to by means of the expression followingthe determiner; the speaker cannot assume that that expressionwill enable the hearer to refer to the seme entity".
Let us con-sider first the 'specific' meaning of the determiner 'a':5) Un uorr~ entre' adagio nel\]a stanza (A man quietly entered ther(x\]~)5r) HEF(S,x,MAN) & not ~NAB\[%SA~REF(S,I-I,MAN) & REF(S,y,DNTER) &REF(S,z,ROOM) & ENABLF/IA~.REF(S,H,ROOM) & AG,~\]'(y,x) & IrE(y,z) & MDD(y,w) & REF(S,w,QUIETLY) & not ARBITRARY(x,MAN)(note that the speaker assumes that the use of the lexeme 'room'enables the he~'er to identify the specific room he is thinkingabout).
This interpretation is the simplest one, since itdirectly encodes the basic m~ning of' the indefinite determiner,i.e.
the reference to an unspecified entity.A first problem is how to get the 'generic' rreaning f~ii thisrepresentation (epistemic and intensio~l interpretations will beanalyzcwl afterw~lrds, since they do not appear as subjnots of sen-tences).
In:6) Un onso va in letargo in inverno (A bear hibernates inwinter)you could probably perceive a ~r~@tning such as: "If yea randar6ypick an iedividtml bear, then yea will see that it hibernates inwinter; of course, the bear y~l will select will probably rmt bethe same bear I am thinking of, but it still hibernates inwinter".
Notice that this paraphrase (as we aassme it is) doesnot i\[~oly the existence of a 'prototypieal' bear to khich the gen-eral property of 'hibernating in winter' <'~ihould apply: we arereferring to an arbitrary element of the class we are talkingabout, although ~.~ are not saying that no exceptions exist.
It isthis non~identlfiability of the element for which the property ispredicated that allows the he;men to obtain the state generalresult.But now, what is the difference between ex.5 and ex.6?
In thefirst ease (specific interpretation), the speaker is referring toa particular individt~al, ~hereas in the second one he is not.
We.can state that in the specific interpretation IDE~\['IFIABLE(S,S,x),whereas in the generic interpretation 'not ID\[~I'IFIARLE(S,S,x)'.Of course, in both eases the presence of ' notENABLESA~REF(S,H,EXP) ' should allow to infer that 'notIDE~'IFIABLE(S,H,x) ' , that is, to the speaker's knowledge, x isnot identifiable by the hearer by ire~mns of the expression EXPused.
Note that this does not mean that the hearer will not beable to identify x, but only t~at the speaker is not willing toasssme so (s~m examples will be provided afterwards).
Therepresentation we get for ex.6 is:~ R~(s,?,ExP) ~ ~ABm~___~MZREF(S,H,EXP) ~ ID~IF~IZ(S\[S,x) IREF(S,x, EXP) & not ENABLESAFEREF ( S, H, EXP ) & notARBITRARY(x )~(S,x, ,~) ~ ~(x)  \]Table I: Sem~tie representation of the r~_aning of determiners.Note that the representation includes the R~,' predicate, whichwill be actually built up on the basis of the expression followingthe determiner,.
This has been done in order to provide a means ofunifying the variable x occurring in the other predicates with theone appearing in the representation of the relmining NP.3456r) REF(S,x,BEAR) & not ENABLESA~RBE(S,H,BEAR) & notIDENTIFIABLE(S,S,x) & not .~gBITRARY(x,BEAR) & REF(S,y,TOHIBERNATE) & REF(S,z,WINTER) & AC~(y,x) & TI~(y,z).It could be argued that there is no reason why in the analysis ofdefinite determiners we allowed the 'expression' following thedeterminer to refer to an intensional object, whereas in the inde~finite case we do not.
However, lar~uage works just because weassume (sometimes incorrectly) that a given lexeme refers to thesame concept for the whole comr~nity of language users.
This meansthat ~e cannot accept a reading where 'not ENABLNSAFEREF(S,H,EXP)'occurs and where EXP is intended to refer to a generic concept.In order to discuss the other two interpretations of indefinitedeterminers, we need to refer to their use in eases different fromthe subject of the sentence, or, more precisely, in sententlalcontexts where there is another partecipant, different f~em thespeaker, who has an 'active' role.
In these cases, the representa ~tion m~st account for the existence of a referentiality predicateattributed to someone different from the speaker and the hearer.The first well known example is provided by a 'desire' verb, thatis 'to want':7) John wants to nmrry a NorwegianSome different meanings can be characterized by the hearer's dif-ferent replies :7a) No, Ingrid isn't a Norwegian.7b) Who is she?7c) How does he think he can find one?In the first case, the speaker is using the word 'Nor~ngian' torefer to John's future wife, bat the speaker does net agree onthat word (*).
In the second case, the hearer assumes that thespeaker is referring to a specific girl whom he does net knew.
Inthe third case, he assumes the speaker is not referring to anypar ticu\]ar Norwegian.In all cases there is a common core in the representation ofthe initial sentence; it is:7r) REF(S,x,JOI~) & REF(S,y,TO WANT) & REF(S,z,TO MARRY) &REF(S,w,NORWEGIAN) & not ENABLESAMEREF(S,H,NORWEOIAN) & notARBITARY ( w, NDRWEGIAN ) & AG~(y,x) & OBJECT(y, z) &AGENT(z,x) & OBJECT(z,w)To this basic interpretation, scme different predicates are addedfor each different case:7ar) IDE~FfIFIABLE(S,S,w) for the standard "specific" interpreta-tion of the indefinite determine~; IDENTIFIABLE(H,H,w) & notREF(H,w,NDRWEGIAN) to state the hearer's disagreement.7br) IDENTIFIABLE(S,S,w) & not IDENTIFIABLE(H,N,w)7cr) not ID~TIFIABLE(S,S,w)But now ~e have the possibility to characterize two subcases of c:in the first one (ci) S does not know the Norwegian that Johnwants to m~rry, but John does know her; in the second ease (c2)the identification is generic fer both of them:7cir) IDenTIFIABLE(x, x,w)7e2r) not IDENTIFIABLE(x,x,w)The last determiner (in Croft's analysis) is "any".
Its represen ~tation is reported in table I, but lack of space prevents us fromdiscussing it (mereover, not all students agree on its status ofdeterminer ~ vs. quantifier ~ and no Italian lexeme has a meaningexactly equivalent to "any").We list below the rules m~re strictly concerned with the opera-tional inter1~retation of the predicates associated with deter ~miners:RI (Definite) :if REF(S,x,exp) & ~ABLESA~RBE(S,H,x) & IDENTIFIABLE(S,S,x)then leeatenode( exp, x)R2 (Specific indefinite):if REF(S,x,exp) & not ENABLESA~REF(S,H,x)IDENTIFIABLE(S, S, x)then createnode(exp,x), n~rk(x, 'INDIVIDUAL' )(*) Note that neither the speaker nor the bearer are necessari ~ly right.
Fer instance, the speaker could reply "She was born inO~Io", and the hearer "~t  last year she got the U.S. citizen ~ship".346R3 (Plural definite) :if REF(S,x,exp) & ~ABLESA~R~F(S,H,x) & SET2(x)then lecateset(exp,x)R4 (Generic indefinite):if REF(S,x, exp) & not ENABBE~AMEBEF(S,H,x) & notIDEN?IFIABLE(S,S,x) & not ARBITRARY(x,exp)then ereatenode(exp,x), r~rk(x, 'GENERIC~BEFgASIBLE ' )A few words on the functions used in the acticn part of therules:locatenode looks first for individual referents; if none isavailable it considers generic nodes.createnede builds a new instance of the most specific availableconcept identified by exp.iooateset works exactly as looatenode, but the node that itlooks for nust represent a set.Tnese rules are not complete, as they do not take into account~istemic and Intensional Indefinite: in fact, both the represen ~tations of these interpretations nust include the hypotheticalknowledge of another individual and, as we said before, we did nottreat belief contexts.CONCLUDING REMARKSInterpretation of de~terminers and quantifiers is usually over-simplified in many natural language interfaces.
We think the for~melism discussed in this paper constitutes a significant step inrepresenting the meaning of the sentence at a more abstract levelthan many interfaces do; at the same time we can directly exploitthe features of this representation to build the actual updatecor~nand or query.Other approaches use a direct translation of the sentence fromits surface form (or from a purely syntactic tree) into arepresentation language which is actually a KB ~ement  or a DBquery language.
The formalism discussed in this pages does notmake any assumption on the language used for actually accessingthe KB (and for this reason the formalism does represent the mean-ing of a sentence in a natural or at least 'neutral' way \[Hobbs1985, Schubert & Pelletier 1982\]).On the other hand, the formalism is not too far from the waythe domain kncwledge is (or could be) represented inside a KB orDB, so that it is easy to develop translation rules stating ~natoperations on the KB or DB should be done.The constraints on the available space prevented us ~ dis-cussing the problem of using the context to disambiguate among thedifferent meanings of a given determiner (e.g.
specific vs.unspecific "a").
Some efforts were made and the results areencouraging, though in irony cases it is only very high-levelinformation (e.g.
~utual knowledge and beliefs) can provide thebasis for selecting the right interpretation.REFERENCESB.Croft: "Determiners and Specification" Report no.
