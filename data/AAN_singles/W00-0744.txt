68, CZ-602 00 Brno, Czech Republic{glum, popel, nepil}@fi.muni.czAbst rac tIn Czech corpora compound verb groups areusually tagged in word-by-word manner.
As aconsequence, some of the morphological tags ofparticular components of the verb group losetheir original meaning.
We present a method forautomatic recognition of compound verb groupsin Czech.
From an annotated corpus 126 def-inite clause grammar rules were constructed.These rules describe all compound verb groupsthat are frequent in Czech.
Using those ruleswe can find compound verb groups in unanno-tated texts with the accuracy 93%.
Taggingcompound verb groups in an annotated corpusexploiting the verb rules is described.Keywords :  compound verb groups, chunking,morphosyntactic tagging, inductive logic pro-gramming1 Compound Verb  GroupsRecognition and analysis of the predicate in asentence is fundamental for the meaning of thesentence and its further analysis.
In more thanhalf of Czech sentences the predicate containsthe compound verb group.
E.g.
in the sentenceMrzl m~, 2e jsem o td konferenci nev~d~la, bylabych se j l  zdSastnila.
(literary translation: I amsorry that I did not know about the conference,I would have participated in it.)
there are threeverb groups<vg> Mrzl  </vg> m~, 5e <vg> jsem o td kon-ferenci nev~d~la </vg>,  <vg> byla bych se j lzdSastnila.
</vg>I <vg> am sorry </vg> that I <vg> didnot know </vg> about the conference, I <vg>would have participated </vg> in it.Verb groups are often split into more parts withso called gap words.
In the second verb groupthe gap words are o td konferenci (about theconference).
In annotated Czech corpora, in-cluding DESAM (Pala et al, 1997), compoundverb groups are usually tagged in word-by-wordmanner.
As a consequence, some of the morpho-logical tags of particular components of the verbgroup loose their original meaning.
It meansthat the tags are correct for a single word butthey do not reflect the meaning of the words incontext.
In the above sentence the word jsemis tagged as a verb in present ense, but thewhole verb group to which it belongs - jsemnev~d~la - is in past tense.
Similar situation ap-pears in byla bych se j l  zdSastnila (I would haveparticipated in it) where zdSastnila is tagged aspast tense while it is only a part of past condi-tional.
Without finding all parts of a compoundverb group and without agging the whole group(what is necessary dependent on other parts ofthe compound verb group) it is impossible tocontinue with any kind of semantic analysis.We consider a compound verb group to be alist of verbs and maybe the reflexive pronounsse, si.
Such a group is obviously compound ofauxiliary and full-meaning verbs, e.g.
budu seum~vat where budu is auxiliary verb (like will inEnglish), se is the reflexive pronoun and um~vatmeans to wash. As word-by-word tagging ofverb groups is confusing, it is useful to find andassign a new tag to the whole group.
This tagshould contain information about the beginningand the end of the group and about the particu-lar components of the verb group.
It must alsocontain information about relevant grammati-cal categories that characterise the verb groupas a whole.
In (Zg~kov~ and Pala, 1999), a pro-posal of the method for automatic finding of219compound verb groups in the corpus DESAMis introduced.
We describe here the improvedmethod that results in definite clause grammarrules - called verb rules - that contain informa-tion about all components of a particular verbgroup and about tags.
We describe also someimprovements hat allow us to increase the ac-curacy of verb group recognition.The paper is organised as follows.
Corpus DE-SAM is described in Section 2.
Section 3 con-tains a description of the method for learningverb rules.
Recognition of verb groups in anno-tated text is discussed in Section 4.
Improve-ments of this method are introduced in Sec-tion 5.
In Section 6 we briefly show how thetag for the compound verb group is constructedemploying verb rules.
We conclude with dis-cussion (Section 7), the description of ongoingresearch (Section 8) and with a summary of rel-evant works (Section 9).2 Data  SourceDESAM (Pala et al, 1997), the annotated andfully disambiguated corpus of Czech newspapertexts, has been used as the source of learningdata.
It contains more than 1 000 000 wordpositions, about 130 000 different word forms,about 65 000 of them occurring more then once,and 1 665 different ags.
E.g.
in Tab.
1 the tagkbeApFnStMmPaP of the word zd6astnila (partic-ipated) means: part of speech (k) = verb (5),person (p) = feminine (F), number (n) = sin-gular (S) and tense (t) = past (M).
Lemmataand possible tags are prefixed by <1>, <t> re-spectively.
As pointed out in (Pala et al, 1997;PopeHnsk~ et al, 1999), DESAM is not largeenough.
It does not contain the representativeset of Czech sentences yet.
In addition somewords are tagged incorrectly and about 1/5 po-sitions are untagged.3 Learn ing  Verb  Ru lesThe algorithm for learning verb rules (Z?bkov?and Pala, 1999) takes as its input annotatedsentences from corpus DESAM.
The algorithmis split into three steps: finding w~rb chunks(i.e.
finding boundaries of simple clauses incompound or in complex sentences, and elim-ination of gap words), generalisation and verbrule synthesis.
These three steps are describedbelow.Mrzfm@~e <l>~e<t>k8xSjsem <l>b~t<t>k5eAplnStPmIaIo <1>o<t>kTc46t@ <l>ten<t>k3xDgFnSc6<t>k3xOgXnSc6p3konferenci <l>konference<t>klgFnSc6nev~d~la <l>v~d~t<t>k5eNpFnStMmPaIbyla <l>b~t<t>k5eApFnStMmPaIbych <l>by<t>k5eAplnStPmCa~se <l>se<t>k3xXnSc4jl < l>on<t>k3xPgFnSc2p3zdbastnila <l>zfibastnit<t>k5eApFnStMmPaP<l>mrzet<t >k5eAp3nStPmIaI<l>j?<t>k3xPnSc24plTable 1: Example of the disambiguated Czechsentence3.1 Verb ChunksThe observed properties of a verb group are thefollowing: their components are either verbs ora reflexive pronoun se (si); the boundary of averb group cannot be crossed by the boundaryof a sentence; and between two components ofthe verb group there can be a gap consisting ofan arbitrary number of non-verb words or even awhole sentence.
In the first step, the boundariesof all sentences are found.
Then each gap isreplaced by tag gap.The method exploits only the lemma of eachword (nominative singular for nouns, adjectives,pronouns and numerals, infinitive for verbs) andits tag.
We will demonstrate he whole processusing the third simplex sentence of the clause inTab.

Three generalisation perations are em-ployed: elimination of (some of) lemmata, gen-eralisation of grammatical categories and find-ing grammatical greement constraints.3.2.1 E l iminat ion of lemmataAll lemmata except forms of auxiliary verb bit(to be) (b~t, by, aby, kdyby) are rejected.
Lem-mata of modal verbs and verbs with similar be-haviour are replaced by tag modal.
These verbshave been found in the list of more than 15 000verb valencies (Pala and Seve?ek P., 1999).
Inour example it is the verb zdSastnit hat is re-moved.b@t/k5eApFnStMmPaIby/k5eAplnStPmCaIk3xXnSc3gapk5eApFnStMmPaP3.2.2 Generalisation of grammaticalcategoriesExploiting linguistic knowledge, several gram-matical categories are not important for verbgroup description.
Very often it is negation (e),or aspect (a - aI stands for imperfectum, aPfor perfectum).
These categories may be re-moved.
For some of verbs even person (p) canbe removed.
In our example the values of thosegrammatical categories have been replaced by ?and we obtainedb~t/k5e?pFnStMmPa?by/k5e?p?nStPmCa?k3xXnSc?gapk5e?pFnStMmPa?3.2.3 Finding grammatical agreementconstraintsAnother situation appears when two or morevalues of some category are related.
In the sim-plest case they have to be the same - e.g.
thevalue of attribute person (p) in the first and thelast word of our example.
More complicated isthe relation among the values of attribute num-ber (n).
They should be the same except whenthe polite way of addressing occurs, e.g.
in bylbyste se j i  zdSastnil (you would have partici-pated in it).
Thus we have to check whether thevalues are the same or the conditions of politeway of addressing are satisfied.
For this purposewe add the predicate check_.num() that ensuresagreement in the grammatical category numberand we obtainb~t/k5e?p_n_tMmPa?by/k5e?p?n_tPmCa?k3xXnSc?gapk5e?p_n_tMmPa?check_hum(n)3.3 DCG Rules SynthesisFinally the verb rule is constructed by rewritingthe result of the generalisation phase.
For thesentence byla bych se j l  zd6astnila (I would haveparticipated in it) we obtainverb_group (vg (Be, Cond, Se, Verb),Gaps) -->be (Be ,_, P, N, tM.,mP,_),7, b~t/k5e?p_n_tMmPa?cond (Cond, .... Ncond, tP, mC, _),7, by/k5e?p?n_tPmCa?
{che ck_num (N, Ncond, Cond, Vy) },ref lex_pron (Se, xX, _, _),7, k3xXnSc?gap( \[\] ,Gaps),7. gapk5 (Verb .
.
.
.
.
P,N,tM,mP,_).7. k5e?p_n_tMmPa?If this rule does not exist in the set of verbrules yet~ it is added into it.
The meaningsof non-terminals used in the rule are following:221be() represents auxiliary verb b~t, cond() rep-resents various forms of conditionals by, aby,kdyby, ref lex_pron()  stands for reflexive pro-noun se (si), gap() is a special predicate formanipulation with gaps, and k5 () stands for ar-bitrary non-auxiliary verb.
The particular val-ues of some arguments of non-terminals repre-sent required properties.
Simple cases of gram-matical agreement are treated through bindingof variables.
More complicated situations aresolved employing constraints like the predicatecheck_hum().The method has been implemented in Perl.
126definite clause grammar rules were constructedfrom the annotated corpus that describe all verbgroups that are frequent in Czech.4 Recogn i t ion  o f  Verb  GroupsThe verb rules have been used for recognition,and consequently for tagging, of verb groups inunannotated text.
A portion of sentences whichhave not been used for learning, has been ex-tracted from a corpus.
Each sentence has beenambiguously tagged with LEMMA morphologi-cal analyser (Pala and Seve~ek, 1995), i.e.
eachword of the sentence has been assigned to allpossible tags.
Then all the verb rules were ap-plied to each sentence.
The learned verb rulesdisplayed quite good accuracy.
For corpus DE-SAM, a verb rule has been correctly assigned to92.3% verb groups.
We tested, too, how muchis this method dependent on the corpus thatwas used for learning.
As the source of testingdata we used Prague Tree Bank (PTB) Corpusthat is under construction at Charles Univer-sity in Prague.
The accuracy displayed was notdifferent from results for DESAM.
It maybe x-plained by the fact that both corpora have beenbuilt from newspaper articles.Although the accuracy is acceptable for the testdata that include also clauses with just oneverb, errors have been observed for complex sen-tences.
In about 13% of them, some of com-pound verb groups were not correctly recog-nized.
It was observed that almost 7{)% of theseerrors were caused by incorrect lemrna recogni-tion.
In the next section we describe a methodfor fixing this kind of errors.5 Fixing Misclassification ErrorsWe combined two approaches, elimination oflemmata which are very rare for a givenword form, and inductive logic program-ming (Popelinsk~ et al, 1999; Pavelek andPopelinsk~, 1999).
The method is used in thepost-processing phase to prune the set of rulesthat have fired for the sentence.5.1 E l iminat ion of in f requent  lemmataIn Czech corpora it was observed that 10% ofword positions - i.e.
each 10th word of a text- have at least 2 lemmata nd about 1% wordforms of Czech vocabulary has at least 2 lem-mata.
(Popelinsk~ et al, 1999; Pavelek andPopelinsk~, 1999) E.g.
word form psi can becorrect rules(%)> 1 verb allnumber of examples 349 600original method 86.8 92.3+ infrequent lemmata 91.1 94.8+ ILP 92.8 95.8Table 2: DESAM: Results for unannotated textcorrect rules(%)> 1 verb allnumber of examples 284 467original method 87.0 92.1+ infrequent lemmata 91.6 94.9+ ILP 92.6 95.5Table 3: PTB: Results for unannotated texteither preposition at (like at the lesson) or im-perative of argue.
We decided to remove all theverb rules that recognised a word-lemma coupleof a very small frequency in the corpus.
Actu-ally those lemmata that did not appear morethan twice in DESAM corpus were supposed tobe incorrect.For testing, we randomly chose the set of 600examples including compound or complex sen-tences from corpus DESAM.
251 sentences con-tained only one verb.
The results obtained arein Tab.
2.
The first line contains the numberof examples used.
In the following line thereare results of the original method as mentionedin Section 4.
Next line (+ infrequent lemmata)222displays results when the word-lemma couple ofa very small frequency have been removed.
Thecolumn '> 1 verb' concerns the sentences whereat least two verbs appeared.
The column 'all'displays accuracy for all sentences.
Results forcorpus PTB are displayed in Tab.
3.
It can beobserved that after pruning rules that contain arare lemma the accuracy significantly increased.5.2 Lemma disambiguat ion by ILPSome of incorrectly recognised lemmata cannotbe fixed by the method described.
E.g.
wordform se has two lemmata, se - reflexive pronounand s - preposition with and both word-lemmacouples are very frequent in Czech.
For suchcases we exploited inductive logic programming(ILP).
The program reads the context of thelemma-ambiguous word and results in disam-biguation rules (PopeHnsk~ et al, 1999; Pavelekand Popelinsk~, 1999).
We employed ILP sys-tem Aleph 1.Domain knowledge predicates (Popelinsk~ etal., 1999; Pavelek and Popelinsk~, 1999) havethe form p(Context, first(N),Condition)or p(Context, somewhere,Condition), whereContext contains tags of either left or rightcontext (for the left context in the re-verse order), first(N) defines a subset ofContext, somewhere does not narrow the con-text.
The term Condition can have threeforms, somewhere(List) (the values in Listappeared somewhere in the define subset ofContext), always(List) (the values appearedin all tags in the given subset of Context) andn_times (N ,Tag) (Tag may appear n-times in thespecified context).
E.g.
p(Left, first(2),always ( \[k5, eA\] ) ) succeeds if in the first twotags of the left context there always appearsk5, eA.In the last line of Tab.
2 and 3 there is the per-centage of correct rules when also the lemmadisambiguation has been employed.
The in-crease of accuracy was much smaller than afterpruning rules that contain a rare lemma.
It hasto be mentioned that in the case of PTB about ahalf of errors (incorrectly recognised verb rules)were caused by incorrect recognition of sentenceboundaries.lhttp://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/research/axeas/machleaxn/Aleph/aleph.html6 Tagg ing  Verb  GroupsWe now describe a method for compound verbgroup tagging in morphologically annotatedcorpora.
We decided to use SGML-like notationfor tagging because it allows to incorporatethe new tags very easily into DESAM corpus.The beginning and the end of the whole verbgroup and beginnings and ends of its particularcomponents are marked.
For the sentence bylabych se j l  zd6astnila (I would have participatedin it) we receive<vg tag=" eApFnSt PmCaPr iv0"fmverb=" zfi~ astnit "><vgp>byla</vgp><vgp>bych</vgp><vgp>se</vgp>jx<vgp>zfi~astnila</vgp> </vg>where <vg> </vg> point out the beginningand the end of the verb group, <vgp> </vgp>mark components (parts) of the verb group.The assigned tag - i.e.
values of significantmorphologic ategories - of the whole group isincluded as a value of attribute called tag inthe starting mark of the group.
Value of theattribute fmverb is the full-meaning verb; thisinformation can be exploited e.g.
for searchingand processing of verb valencies afterwards.The value of attribute tag is computed auto-matically from the verb rule that describes thecompound verb group.We are also able to detect other properties ofcompound verb groups.
In the example abovethe new category r is introduced.
It indicatesthat the group is reflexive (rl) or not (r0).The category v enables to mark whether thegroup is in the form of polite way of addressing(vl) or not (v0).
The differences of the tagvalues can be observed comparing the previousand the following examples (nebyl byste se j lzd6astnil (you would not have participated init))<vg tag="eNpMnStPmCaPrlvl"fmverb=" zfi~ astnit" ><vgp>nebyl</vgp><vgp>byste</vgp><vgp>se</vgp><vgp>zfi~astnil</vgp> </vg>223The set of attributes can be also enriched e.g.with the number of components.
We also planto include into the attributes of <vg> com-pound verb group type.
It will enable to findthe groups of the same type but wit:h differentword order or the number of components.7 D iscuss ionSometimes compound verb groups are defined ina less general way.
Another approach that dealwith the recognition and morphological taggingof compound verb groups in Czech appeared in(Osolsob~, 1999).
Basic compound verb groupsin Czech like active present, passive past tense,present conditional etc., are defined in termsof grammatical categories used in DESAM cor-pus.
Two drawbacks of this approach can beobserved.
First, verb groups may only be com-pound of a reflexive pronoun, verbs to be andnot more than one full-meaning verb,.
Second,the gap between two words of the particulargroup cannot be longer than three words.
Theverb rules defined here are less general then thebasic verb groups (Osolsob~, 1999).
Actuallyverb rules make partition of them.
Thus we cantag all these basic verb groups withont the lim-itations mentioned above.
In contrast o someother approaches we include into the groups alsosome verbs which are in fact infinitive partici-pants of verb valencies.
However, we are able todetect such cases and recognize the "pure" verbgroups afterwards.
We believe that for somekind of shallow semantic analysis - e.g.
in di-alogue systems - our approach is more conve~nient.We are also able to recognize the form of po-lite way of addressing a person (which has notequivalent in English, but similar phenomenonappears e.g.
in French or German).
We extendthe tag of a verb group with this inibrmation.because it is quite important for understandingthe sentence.
E.g.
in gel jste (vous ~tes allg) theword jste (~tes) should be counted as singularalthough it is always tagged as plural.8 Ongo ing  ResearchOur work is a part of the project which aimsat building a partial parser for Czech.
Mainidea of partial parsing (Abney, 1991) is to rec-ognize those parts of sentences which can be re-covered reliably and with a small amount of syn-tactic information.
In this paper we deal withrecognition and tagging potentially discontinu-ous verb chunks.
The problem of recognition ofnoun chunks in Czech was addressed in (Smr2and Z?~kov?, 1998).
We aim at an advancedmethod that should employ a minimum of adhoc techniques and should be, ideally, fully au-tomatic.
The first step in this direction, themethod for pruning verb rules, has been de-scribed in this paper.
In the future we wantto make the method even more adaptive.
Somepreliminary results on finding sentence bound-ary are displayed below.In Czech it is either comma and/or a conjunc-tion that make the boundary between two sen-tences.
From the corpus we have randomly cho-sen 406 pieces of text that contain a comma.In 294 cases the comma split two sentences.
All"easy" cases (when comma is followed by a con-junction, it must be a boundary) were removed.It was 155 out of 294 cases.
80% of the rest ofexamples was used for learning.
We used againAleph for learning.
For the test set the learnedrules correctly recognised comma as a delimiterof two sentences in 86.3% of cases.
When the"easy" cases were added the accuracy increasedto 90.8%.Then we tried to employ this method for auto-matic finding of boundaries in our system forverb group recognition.
Decrease of accuracywas expected but it was quite small.
In spite ofsome extra boundary was found (the particularcomma did not split two sentences), the correctverb groups have been found in most of suchcases.
The reason is that such incorrectly de-tected boundary splits a compound verb groupvery rarely.The last experiment concerned the case whena conjunction splits two sentences and the con-junction is not preceded with comma.
Thereare four such conjunctions in Czech - a (and),nebo (or), i (even) and ani (neither, nor).
Us-ing Aleph we obtained the accuracy on test data88.3% for a (500 examples, 90% used/ for  learn-ing) and 87.2% for nebo (110 examples).
Thelast two conjunctions split sentences very rarely.Actually, in the current version of corpus DE-SAM it has never happened.2249 Re levant  worksAnother approach for recognition of compoundverb groups in Czech (Osolsob~, 1999) havebeen already discussed in Section 7.
Ramshawand Marcus (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) viewschunking as a tagging problem.
They usedtransformation-based learning and achieved re-call and precision rates 93% for base nounphrase (non-recursive noun phrase) and 88% forchunks that partition the sentence.
Verb chunk-ing for English was solved by Veenstra (Veen-stra, 1999).
He used memory-based learnerTimbl for noun phrase, verb phrase and propo-sitional phrase chunking.Each word in a sen-tence was first assigned one of tags I_T (insidethe phrase), O_T (outside the phrase) and B_T(left-most word in the phrase that is precededby another phrase of the same kind), where Tstands for the kind of a phrase.Chunking in Czech language is more difficultthan in English for two reasons.
First, a gapinside a verb group may be more complex andit may be even a whole sentence.
Second, Czechlanguage is a free word-order language what im-plies that the process of recognition of the verbgroup structure is much more difficult.10 Conc lus ionWe described the method for automatic recog-nition of compound verb groups in Czech sen-tences.
Recognition of compound verb groupswas tested on unannotated text randomly cho-sen from two different corpora and the accu-racy reached 95% of correctly recognised verbgroups.
We also introduced the method for au-tomatic tagging of compound verb groups.AcknowledgementsWe thank to anonymous referees for their com-ments.
