While subjectivity classification labelstext as either subjective or objective, sentimentclassification adds an additional level of gran-ularity, by further classifying subjective text aseither positive, negative or neutral.While much of the research work in thisarea has been applied to English, researchon other languages is growing, includingJapanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Ro-manian.
While most of the researchers inthe field are familiar with the methods ap-plied on English, few of them have closelylooked at the original research carried out inother languages.
For example, in languagessuch as Chinese, researchers have been look-ing at the ability of characters to carry sen-timent information (Ku et al, 2005; Xiang,2011).
In Romanian, due to markers of po-liteness and additional verbal modes embed-ded in the language, experiments have hintedthat subjectivity detection may be easier toachieve (Banea et al, 2008).
These addi-tional sources of information may not be avail-able across all languages, yet, various arti-cles have pointed out that by investigating asynergistic approach for detecting subjectiv-ity and sentiment in multiple languages at thesame time, improvements can be achieved notonly in other languages, but in English aswell.
The development and interest in thesemethods is also highly motivated by the factthat only 27% of Internet users speak En-glish (www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm,Oct 11, 2011), and that number diminishesfurther every year, as more people across theglobe gain Internet access.The aim of this tutorial is to familiarize theattendees with the subjectivity and sentimentresearch carried out on languages other thanEnglish in order to enable and promote cross-fertilization.
Specifically, we will review workalong three main directions.
First, we willpresent methods where the resources and toolshave been specifically developed for a giventarget language.
In this category, we willalso briefly overview the main methods thathave been proposed for English, but which canbe easily ported to other languages.
Second,we will describe cross-lingual approaches, in-cluding several methods that have been pro-posed to leverage on the resources and toolsavailable in English by using cross-lingualprojections.
Finally, third, we will show howthe expression of opinions and polarity per-vades language boundaries, and thus methodsthat holistically explore multiple languages atthe same time can be effectively considered.ReferencesC.
