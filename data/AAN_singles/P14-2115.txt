We developed a wide variety ofnovel approaches to automatically encodeproper and interesting morphs, which caneffectively pass decoding tests1.1 IntroductionOne of the most innovative linguistic forms in so-cial media is Information Morph (Huang et al,2013).
Morph is a special case of alias to hide theoriginal objects (e.g., sensitive entities and events)for different purposes, including avoiding censor-ship (Bamman et al, 2012; Chen et al, 2013),expressing strong sentiment, emotion or sarcasm,and making descriptions more vivid.
Morphs arewidely used in Chinese social media.
Here is anexample morphs: ?????????????????.

(Teletubbies)?
;In contrast with covert or subliminal chan-nels studied extensively in cryptography and se-curity, Morphing provides confidentiality againsta weaker adversary which has to make a real timeor near real time decision whether or not to blocka morph within a time interval t. It will take longerthan the duration t for a morph decoder to decidewhich encoding method is used and exactly how itis used; otherwise adversary can create a codebookand decode the morphs with a simple look up.We note that there are other distinct characteristicsof morphs that make them different from crypto-graphic constructs: (1) Morphing can be consid-ered as a way of using natural language to com-municate confidential information without encryp-tion.
Most morphs are encoded based on seman-tic meaning and background knowledge insteadof lexical changes, so they are closer to Jargon.
(2) There can be multiple morphs for an entity.
(3) The Shannon?s Maxim ?the enemy knows thesystem?
does not always hold.
There is no com-mon code-book or secret key between the senderand the receiver of a morph.
(4) Social networksplay an important role in creating morphs.
Onemain purpose of encoding morphs is to dissemi-nate them widely so they can become part of thenew Internet language.
Therefore morphs shouldbe interesting, fun, intuitive and easy to remem-ber.
(5) Morphs rapidly evolve over time, as somemorphs are discovered and blocked by censorshipand newly created morphs emerge.We propose a brand new and challenging re-search problem - can we automatically encodemorphs for any given entity to help users commu-nicate in an appropriate and fun way?7062 Approaches2.1 Motivation from Human ApproachesLet?s start from taking a close look at human?sintentions and general methods to create morphsfrom a social cognitive perspective.
In Table 1and Table 2, we summarize 548 randomly selectedmorphs into different categories.
In this paper weautomate the first seven human approaches, with-out investigating the most challenging Method 8,which requires deep mining of rich backgroundand tracking all events involving the entities.2.2 M1: Phonetic SubstitutionGiven an entity name e, we obtain its pho-netic transcription pinyin(e).
Similarly, for eachunique term t extracted from Tsinghua Weibodataset (Zhang et al, 2013) with one billiontweets from 1.8 million users from 8/28/2012 to9/29/2012, we obtain pinyin(t).
According to theChinese phonetic transcription articulation man-ner2, the pairs (b, p), (d, t), (g,k), (z,c), (zh,ch),( j,q), (sh,r), (x,h), (l,n), (c,ch), (s,sh) and (z,zh)are mutually transformable.If a part of pinyin(e) and pinyin(t) are identi-cal or their initials are transformable, we substi-tute the part of e with t to form a new morph.For example, we can substitute the characters of???
??
(Bill Gates) [Bi Er Gai Ci]?
with???
(Nose and ear) [Bi Er]?
and ???
(Lid)[Gai Zi]?
to form new morph ???
??
(Noseand ear Lid) [Bi Er Gai Zi]?.
We rank the candi-dates based on the following two criteria: (1) If themorph includes more negative words (based on agazetteer including 11,729 negative words derivedfrom HowNet (Dong and Dong, 1999), it?s morehumorous (Valitutti et al, 2013).
(2) If the morphincludes rarer terms with low frequency, it is moreinteresting (Petrovic and Matthews, 2013).2.3 M2: Spelling DecompositionChinese characters are ideograms, hieroglyphsand mostly picture-based.
It allows us to natu-rally construct a virtually infinite range of combi-nations from a finite set of basic units - radicals (Liand Zhou, 2007).
Some of these radicals them-selves are also characters.
For a given entity namee = c1...cn, if any character ckcan be decomposedinto two radicals c1kand c2kwhich are both char-acters or can be converted into characters basedon their pictograms (e.g., the radical ???
can be2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Initials and finalsconverted into???
(grass) ), we create a morph byreplacing ckwith c1kc2kin e. Here we use a charac-ter to radical mapping table that includes 191 rad-icals (59 of them are characters) and 1328 com-mon characters.
For example, we create a morph????
(Person Dumb Luo)?
for ???
(Paul)?by decomposing ??
(Pau-)?
into ??
(Person)?and ??
(Dull)?.
A natural alternative is to com-posing two chracter radicals in an entity name toform a morph.
However, very few Chinese namesinclude two characters with single radicals.2.4 M3: Nickname GenerationWe propose a simple method to create morphs byduplicating the last character of an entity?s firstname.
For example, we create a morph ???(Mimi)?
to refer to ???
(Yang Mi)?.2.5 M4: Translation and TransliterationGiven an entity e, we search its English translationEN(e) based on 94,015 name translation pairs (Jiet al, 2009).
Then, if any name component inEN(e) is a common English word, we search forits Chinese translation based on a 94,966 wordtranslation pairs (Zens and Ney, 2004), and use theChinese translation to replace the correspondingcharacters in e. For example, we create a morph???
??
(Larry bird)?
for ???
??
(LarryBird)?
by replacing the last name ???
(Bird)?with its Chinese translation ???
(bird)?.2.6 M5: Semantic InterpretationFor each character ckin the first name of a givenentity name e, we search its semantic interpreta-tion sentence from the Xinhua Chinese characterdictionary including 20,894 entries3.
If a wordin the sentence contains ck, we append the wordwith the last name of e to form a new morph.
Sim-ilarly to M1, we prefer positive, negative or rarewords.
For example, we create a morph ????
(Bo Mess)?
for ????
(Bo Xi Lai)?
because thesemantic interpretation sentence for ??
(Lai)?
in-cludes a negative word ???
(Mess)?.2.7 M6: Historical Figure MappingWe collect a set of 38 famous historical figuresincluding politicians, emperors, poets, generals,ministers and scholars from a website.
For a givenentity name e, we rank these candidates by ap-plying the resolution approach as described in ourprevious work (Huang et al, 2013) to measure thesimilarity between an entity and a historic figure3http://xh.5156edu.com/707CategoryFrequencyDistributionExamplesEntity Morph Comment(1) Avoid censorship 6.56% ???

(Mao Zedong)?
who is thefirst chairman of P. R. China and ???

for ????
(Deng Xiaoping )?who succeeded Mao.2.8 M7: Characteristics ModelingFinally, we propose a novel approach to auto-matically generate an entity?s characteristics usingGoogle word2vec model (Mikolov et al, 2013).To make the vocabulary model as general as pos-sible, we use all of the following large corporathat we have access to: Tsinghua Weibo dataset,Chinese Gigaword fifth edition4which includes10 million news documents, TAC-KBP 2009-2013Source Corpora (McNamee and Dang, 2009; Ji et4http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T13al., 2010; Ji et al, 2011; Ji and Grishman, 2011)which include 3 million news and web documents,and DARPA BOLT program?s discussion forumcorpora with 300k threads.
Given an entity e, wecompute the semantic relationship between e andeach word from these corpora.
We then rank thewords by: (1) cosine similarity, (2) the same cri-teria as in section 2.6.
Finally we append the topranking word to the entity?s last name to obtaina new morph.
Using this method, we are ableto generate many vivid morphs such as ??
??
(Yao Wizard)?
for ???
(Yao Ming)?.3 Experiments3.1 DataWe collected 1,553,347 tweets from Chinese SinaWeibo from May 1 to June 30, 2013.
We extracted708187 human created morphs based on M1-M7 for55 person entities.
Our approach generated 382new morphs in total.3.2 Human EvaluationWe randomly asked 9 Chinese native speakerswho regularly access Chinese social media and arenot involved in this work to conduct evaluation in-dependently.
We designed the following three cri-teria based on Table 1:?
Perceivability: Who does this morph refer to?
(i) Pretty sure, (ii) Not sure, and (iii) No clues.?
Funniness: How interesting is the morph?
(i)Funny, (ii) Somewhat funny, and (iii) Not funny.?
Appropriateness: Does the morph describe thetarget entity appropriately?
(i) Make sense, (ii)Make a little sense, and (iii) Make no sense.The three choices of each criteria account for100% (i), 50% (ii) and 0% (iii) satisfaction rate,respectively.
If the assessor correctly predicts thetarget entity with the Perceivability measure, (s)heis asked to continue to answer the Funniness andAppropriateness questions; otherwise the Funni-ness and Appropriateness scores are 0.
The hu-man evaluation results are shown in Table 4.
TheFleiss?s kappa coefficient among all the human as-sessors is 0.147 indicating slight agreement.From Table 4 we can see that overall the sys-tem achieves 66% of the human performancewith comparable stability as human.
In partic-ular, Method 4 based on translation and translit-eration generates much more perceivable morphsthan human because the system may search in alarger vocabulary.
Interestingly, similar encour-aging results - system outperforms human - havebeen observed by previous back-transliterationwork (Knight and Graehl, 1998).It?s also interesting to see that human assessorscan only comprehend 76% of the human generatedmorphs because of the following reasons: (1) themorph is newly generated or it does not describethe characteristics of the target entity well; and (2)the target entity itself is not well known to humanassessors who do not keep close track of news top-ics.
In fact only 64 human generated morphs and72 system generated morphs are perceivable by allhuman assessors.For Method 2, the human created morphs areassessed as much more and funny than the sys-tem generated ones because human creators usethis approach only if: (1).
the radicals still reflectthe meaning of the character (e.g., ??
(worry)?is decomposed into two radicals ???
(heart au-tumn)?
instead of three ?????
(grain fire heart)because people tend to feel sad when the leavesfall in the autumn), (2).
the morph reflects somecharacteristics of the entity (e.g., ????
(JiangZemin)?
has a morph ?????
(Water Engi-neer Zemin)?
because he gave many instructionson water conservancy construction); or (3).
Themorph becomes very vivid and funny (e.g., themorph ??????
(Muji Yue Yue Bird)?
for????
is assessed as very funny because ???(Muji)?
looks like a Japanese name, ???(YueYue)?
can also refer to a famous chubby woman,and ???
(bird man)?
is a bad word referring tobad people); or (4).
The morph expresses strongsentiment or sarcasm; or (5) The morph is thename of another entity (e.g., the morph ???(GuYue)?
for ????
(Hu Jintao)?
is also the nameof a famous actor who often acts as Mao Zedong).The automatic approach didn?t explore these intel-ligent constraints and thus produced more boringmorph.
Moreover, sometimes human creators fur-ther exploit traditional Chinese characters, gener-alize or modify the decomposition results.Table 3 presents some good (with average scoreabove 80%) and bad (with average score below20%) examples.Good ExamplesEntity Morph Method???

(Lao Tze) M6Table 3: System Generated Morph ExamplesTo understand whether users would adopt sys-tem generated morphs for their social media com-munication, we also ask the assessors to recitethe morphs that they remember after the survey.Among all the morphs that they remember cor-rectly, 20.4% are system generated morphs, whichis encouraging.3.3 Automatic EvaluationAnother important goal of morph encoding is toavoid censorship and freely communicate about709Human System Human System Human System Human System Human System Human System Human System Human System# of morphs 17 124 4 21 10 54 9 28 64 87 9 18 74 50 187 382Perceivability 75 76 95 86 94 81 61 71 87 59 66 5 77 34 76 67Funniness 78 49 92 43 44 41 70 47 70 35 74 28 79 44 76 46Appropriateness 71 51 89 59 81 43 75 49 76 36 78 18 82 38 79 43Average 75 59 92 57 73 55 69 56 78 43 73 17 79 39 77 52Standard Deviation 12.29 21.81 7.32 11.89 13.2 9.2 17.13 20.3 18.83 17.54 10.01 21.23 15.18 15.99 15.99 18.14h s2568 58984214.3 29691742 45712641 1153922692 26766901.8 811317052 1278447812 1E+05255.7 329.12568 58984 214.3 2969 1742 4571 2641 11539 22692 26766 901.8 8113 17052 12784M6 M7 OverallM1 M2 M3 M4 M5Table 4: Human Evaluation Satisfaction Rate (%)certain entities.
To evaluate how well the newmorphs can pass censorship, we simulate the cen-sorship using an automatic morph decoder con-sisted of a morph candidate identification systembased on Support Vector Machines incorporatinganomaly analysis and our morph resolution sys-tem (Huang et al, 2013).
We use each system gen-erated morph to replace its corresponding human-created morphs in Weibo tweets and obtain a new?morphed?
data set.
The morph decoder is thenapplied to it.
We define discovery rate as the per-centage of morphs identified by the decoder, andthe ranking accuracy Acc@k to evaluate the reso-lution performance.
We conduct this decoding ex-periment on 247 system generated and 151 humangenerated perceivable morphs with perceivabilityscores > 70% from human evaluation.Figure 1 shows that in general the decoderachieves lower discovery rate on system gener-ated morphs than human generated ones, becausethe identification component in the decoder wastrained based on human morph related features.This result is promising because it demonstratesthat the system generated morphs contain new andunique characteristics which are unknown to thedecoder.
In contrast, from Figure 2 we can seethat system generated morphs can be more easilyresolved into the right target entities than humangenerated ones which are more implicit.0?20?40?60?80?100?M1?

We incorporated the pronunciation,lexical and semantic similarity measurements pro-posed in these approaches.
Some of our basic se-lection criteria are also similar to the constraintsused in previous work on generating humors (Val-itutti et al, 2013; Petrovic and Matthews, 2013).5 Conclusions and Future WorkThis paper proposed a new problem of encodingentity morphs and developed a wide variety ofnovel automatic approaches.
In the future we willfocus on improving the language-independent ap-proaches based on historical figure mapping andculture and reputation modeling.
In addition, weplan to extend our approaches to other types of in-formation including sensitive events, satires andmetaphors so that we can generate fable stories.We are also interested in tracking morphs overtime to study the evolution of Internet language.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by U.S. ARL No.W911NF-09-2-0053, DARPA No.
