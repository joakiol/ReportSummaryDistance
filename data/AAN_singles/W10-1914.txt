To movetoward this objective, a method is pro-posed for reconstructing original seman-tic relationship graphs from projections,where each node and edge is mapped tothe representative of its equivalence class,by determining the relationship argumentcombinations that represent real relation-ships.
It generalises the limited postpro-cessing step of the method of Bjo?rne et al(2010) and hence extends this extractionmethod to arbitrarily deep relationshipswith unrestricted primary argument com-binations.
The viability of the method isshown by successfully extracting nestedrelationships in BioInfer and the corpusof the BioNLP?09 Shared Task on EventExtraction.
The reported results, to thebest of our knowledge, are the first for thenested relationships in BioInfer on a taskin which only named entities are given.1 IntroductionA recent shared task in biomedical text mining,the BioNLP?09 Shared Task on Event Extrac-tion (Kim et al, 2009), showed that the biomed-ical natural language processing (BioNLP) com-munity is greatly interested in heading towardsthe extraction of deep, semantically rich relation-ships.
The shared task focused on biomolecu-lar events involving proteins and called for meth-ods that are capable of identifying nested struc-tures.
Biomolecular events are a major cate-gory of relationships in the biomedical domain inwhich, among others, relationships involving non-molecular entities such as diseases and static rela-tions such as protein family memberships are alsoof interest.Earlier, well-studied extraction tasks typicallycast the problem in such a manner that relation-ships can be considered as mutually independentatomic units.
However, as a nested semantic struc-ture grows in its depth and in the total numberof relationship arguments, its simultaneous extrac-tion becomes difficult, if not impossible.
Systemsthat bypass this problem by identifying atomicunits of nested structures in a mutually indepen-dent manner must still decide which of the unitscollectively comprise a complete structure.Another problem arises from the fact that a sin-gle syntactic token can refer to several, distinct re-lationships each having a unique combination ofarguments.
This is typically induced by coordi-nations which are common in the biomedical do-main (Pyysalo et al, 2007).
As a result, asidefrom the identification and classification of rela-tionships and their potential arguments, extractionsystems have to make decisions about how manyrelationships should be generated and how the ar-guments should be distributed among them.
Forexample, the sentence ?the binding of A and B toDNA regulates C and D, respectively?
states thatthere are two binding events (A?DNA and B?DNA)the former of which regulates C and the latter D in-stead of, for example, that both binding events reg-ulate both C and D or that there is a single bindingevent between A, B, and DNA.This paper focuses on addressing the afore-mentioned problems in the case of the extrac-tion method developed by Bjo?rne et al (2010) forthe BioNLP?09 Shared Task and generalises thismethod.

A parse in theSD scheme is illustrated in C.dency analyses in the well-established StanfordDependency (SD) scheme (de Marneffe and Man-ning, 2008) can successfully be utilised in extract-ing graphs that express semantic entities as nodesand relationship arguments as edges but are lim-ited to one node per syntactic token.
Nodes andedges can be extracted in a mutually independentmanner but the resulting graph cannot necessarilyexpress all the real relationships.
Rather, the graphcan be seen as a projection of the original graph:each node and edge has been mapped to the rep-resentative of its equivalence class which is deter-mined by the node and edge types and the referredtokens.The research question of this paper is can theoriginal semantic graphs be reconstructed fromprojected graphs with an independent step in aninformation extraction (IE) process?
The objec-tive of deprojection is illustrated as a transforma-tion of the graph B to the graph A in Figure 1.To answer the question, the problem of re-constructing complex, nested semantic structuresfrom their projections is formulated and a genericdeprojection method is proposed.
The methodspecifically addresses primary arguments, as de-fined by the BioNLP?09 Shared Task, while leav-ing the extension to secondary arguments as a fu-ture work.
The viability of the method is anal-ysed with BioInfer (Pyysalo et al, 2007) and theBioNLP?09 Shared Task corpus, both of whichcontaining nested structures, through an IE taskessentially identical to the BioNLP?09 SharedTask.
It is concluded that the proposed methodFigure 2: The deprojection process.can successfully augment the method of Bjo?rneet al (2010) and generalise it to arbitrary graphsof nested biomolecular relationships without thestrict restrictions of the BioNLP?09 Shared Taskwhile retaining its performance level.
Thus, themethod can improve IE systems that produce rela-tionships on the one-per-token basis.2 MethodThe proposed approach to deproject semanticgraphs is outlined in Figure 2.
In summary, thefirst transformation (grouping) alters a projectedgraph such that a minimal set of classes is suf-ficient to describe the behaviour of the nodesand the edges.
Guided by predicted class labels,the second transformation (deprojection) then pro-duces a deprojected graph.
In the presentedmethod, the classification problem is solved withmachine-learning (ML) methods.
Finally, corpus-specific constraints are enforced.2.1 DefinitionsThe graph representation of semantic annotationintroduced by Heimonen et al (2008) is adoptedwith some additional definitions.
Semantic knowl-edge is represented as a directed acyclic graph(DAG) as follows.Nodes and edges correspond to semantic en-tities (such as protein and processes) and rela-tionship arguments, respectively.
The equality ofnodes is determined by the equality of their typesand of their references to text.
Similarly, the equal-ity of edges arises from the equality of their typesand of their end nodes.Shallow and deep relationships consist of anode, its outgoing edges, and its direct successors.The latter also recursively include the successorrelationships.
Nodes are equal as shallow relation-ships if they as well as their outgoing edges are109equal.
Node equality as a deep relationship im-poses the further requirement that the successorsare equal as deep relationships.A valid relationship is one which is valid inthe given corpus-specific annotation scheme.
Es-pecially, it has a valid combination of arguments.A deprojected graph (see Figure 1A) is onein which each node represents a valid, real rela-tionship.
Several equal nodes can exist providedthey have unique combinations of outgoing edges.Note that there is one-to-one correspondence be-tween nodes and real relationships but many-to-one between nodes and syntactic tokens.A projected graph (see Figure 1B) is onegenerated by mapping each node and edge of a de-projected graph to the representative of its equiv-alence class.
That is, each node represents a setof equal nodes of the deprojected graph, and simi-larly for edges.
As a result, each token is referredto by at most one node1 and there is a one-to-manycorrespondence between nodes and valid, real re-lationships.
Also, the edges that are mapped tofrom the outgoing edges of equal nodes of the de-projected graph are the outgoing edges of a singlenode of the projected graph.The deprojection of a semantic graph is thetask of reproducing the original graph given a pro-jected graph.
This can also be seen as a task offinding the sets of outgoing edges that representall the valid, real relationships.2.2 GroupingThe objective of the first transformation is accom-plished with a grouping algorithm: the direct suc-cessors of each node are grouped by their syntac-tic and semantic roles relative to the predecessor.The groups are represented as additional nodesin the graph.
The rationale for this grouping isthat similar arguments tend to either be mutuallyexclusive (and be associated with some other ar-guments) or together form a single relationship.This behaviour can easily be described with twoclasses: distributive and collective.
For example,in the sentence ?A and B regulate C?, the entities Aand B share both the argument type (agent) and thesyntactic role (subject) relative to the relationshipregulate.
They form a group and are mutually ex-clusive (distributive) while this group forms a sin-gle relationship (collective) together with C. As a1given that, in the deprojected graph, a token can be re-ferred to by multiple nodes only if they are of the same typeresult, A?C and B?C pairs of regulation are gener-ated.
This approach relates to the collectivity anddistributivity of plurals which have been studied,among others, by Scha and Stallard (1988) andBrisson (2003).Technically, the grouping is a series of trans-formations in each of which a set of successorsis replaced with a single, newly-created succes-sor and the original successors become the succes-sors of this node.
The successors are first triviallygrouped by the corresponding edge type.
Finally,they are recursively grouped by syntactic similar-ity until they form a single group or multiple sin-gleton groups.
As a result, nested groups are gen-erated.The groups by syntax are determined by firstmapping both the predecessor and the successorsinto the referred tokens in the syntactic graph.Then, the tokens referred to by the predecessorare removed if they are not also referred to byany of the successors.
This removal step is recur-sively applied to the predecessors of the removedtokens.
As a result, the syntactic graph is decom-posed into several connected components, each ofwhich representing a group.
Thus, two successorsare grouped if their referred tokens belong to thesame connected component.2.3 DeprojectionThe second transformation is guided by node classlabels (Figure 3).
A collective node remains un-changed: its successors are kept together.
In con-trast, a distributive node is duplicated for each out-going edge and the edges are distributed, one edgeper duplicate.
These node classes are enough tosolve most of the cases in the analysed data sets.However, especially in BioInfer, this is not suf-ficient since the duplicates of a distributive nodemay themselves be either collective or distributiveunder their predecessor.To adequately describe the behaviour of the du-plicates generated by a single distributive node,the incoming edges of each distributive node areclassified as collective or distributive (Figure 4).The duplication of a node also duplicates its in-coming edges which are then processed by the as-signed class labels as follows.
In the case of a col-lective edge, the generated duplicates of the edgeshare the predecessor and are thus arguments ina single relationship.
In contrast, a distributiveedge induces the duplication of the predecessor re-110Figure 3: The effect of assigning collective or dis-tributive class labels (marked as <?>) to a node inthe deprojection process.Figure 4: Correct node and edge class labels forthe projected graph of the phrase ?Coexpressionand subsequent DNA-binding of X and Y pro-teins?
(A) and the resulting deprojected graph (B).lationships such that, as a result, the generated du-plicate edges do not share any predecessors.In Figure 4A, the node proteins is distributivebecause it represents two distinct nodes: one per-taining to X, another to Y.
These two nodes areinvolved in the same coexpression relationship butin different binding relationships.
Hence the in-coming edges of the node proteins are collectiveand distributive, respectively.Since the two transformation steps do not en-force corpus-specific constraints, a trivial algo-rithm is utilised to decompose relationships withinvalid argument combinations into multiple validrelationships.
In an ideal situation, this step makesno transformations.
This is also used as a part ofthe baseline method (see Section 3.3).2.4 Machine-learning and featuresFor node and edge classifications, the C4.5 deci-sion tree (Quinlan, 1993), and its J48 implemen-tation in the Weka package, was utilised becauseits models can easily be examined.
This facili-tates the analysis of the problem and the furtherdevelopment of the solution.
The default parame-ters were used since no improvement was gainedwith alternative parameters in preliminary experi-ments.
The applied feature set emphasises higher-level features obtained from the semantic and syn-tactic graphs.
It consists of three main groups: se-mantic, syntactic, and morphological.Semantic features contain information gath-ered from the semantic graph as well as from thetype hierarchies.
For nodes, these features consistsof the node type as well as the presence, count andcombination of outgoing edge types.
The count ofsuccessor groups and the distance to the first non-group predecessor are also included.
For edges,the node features are generated for both the suc-cessor and the predecessor in addition to the typeof the edge.Syntactic features include the minimum syn-tactic distance2 from the predecessor to the suc-cessors as well as between the successors.
Also,in the case of the unit distance, the correspondingdependency type is included.Morphological features consist of the Porterstems (Porter, 1980) and the part-of-speech tags ofthe referred tokens as well as the presence and thePorter stems of the tokens that are shared betweenthe successors.All features are also generated from the firstnon-group predecessor (which may be the node it-self) to capture the original relationship node whenprocessing a group node.
The majority of the fea-tures are Boolean-valued in order to allow severalvalues of a single property.
This is utilised in fea-tures representing hierarchical knowledge (such asnode and dependency types) as well as stem fea-tures.
For example, a node receives true for thenode type feature of its actual type as well as of itssupertypes in the hierarchy.3 Resources and experimentsAn array of experiments was performed to anal-yse the deprojection problem and the proposedsolution.
Firstly, the same experiments wereperformed on two corpora, BioInfer and theBioNLP?09 Shared Task corpus in order to eval-uate the effect of the annotation scheme to theproperties of the problem.
Secondly, the deprojec-tion algorithm was applied to both projected gold-standard graphs and to predicted graphs in order tostudy the effect of the accuracy of the input graph.Thirdly, the effect of the quality of the parse was2semantic nodes mapped into the referred tokens111examined by employing various parses includingthe BioInfer gold-standard annotation.3.1 DataBioInfer is a corpus of 1100 sentences selectedfrom 836 publication abstracts available throughPubMed.
For this paper, the abstracts were ran-domly sampled in the ratio 2:1:1 into the train-ing, development, and test sets.
In contrast, theBioNLP?09 Shared Task corpus consists of thetraining, development, and test sets of 800, 150,and 260 abstracts, respectively.
Since the anno-tation of the test set is not publicly available andthe evaluation server does not provide the requireddetails for the analysis, the development set wasused as the test set and a random sample of 150abstracts was cut from the training set to form thedevelopment set.In this study, the task 1 annotation with the pro-tein equivalence relations removed was used as theBioNLP?09 Shared Task data set.
In this anno-tation, relationships are positively asserted, haveonly Theme and Cause arguments and are anno-tated only for one of the equivalent proteins.
Fur-thermore, each node refers to at least one tokenin the syntactic graph.
The BioInfer semantic an-notation was transformed into a similar form byremoving negation (NOT), equivalence (EQUAL),and reference nodes (COREFER, REL-ENT).
Fur-thermore, to create a fully text-bound subset, fam-ily memberships relations (MEMBER) were re-solved into single edges and suitable references totext were added for the remaining unbound nodeswhen possible.
In an extreme case, an unboundrelationship was discarded.
As a result, the differ-ences to the BioNLP?09 Shared Task data set wereminimised to additional node and edge types re-flecting the wider selection of primary arguments.All employed parses follow the SD scheme.BioInfer contains uncollapsed gold-standardparses while the BioNLP?09 Shared Task corpusincludes parses, in the collapsed representation,generated by the parser of Charniak and Johnson(2005) using the model of McClosky and Char-niak (2008).
For both corpora, additional parseswere produced with the improved version of theaforementioned system created by McClosky(2009).
These parses were transformed intoboth the collapsed and the conjunct dependencypropagated representations with the tools pro-vided by de Marneffe et al (2006).
All parseswere further augmented by splitting tokens atnon-alphanumeric characters that border namedentities and connecting the newly-created tokenswith dependencies denoting the character.3.1.1 Predicted graphsThe predicted semantic graphs were obtained asa result of an extraction task adopted from theBioNLP?09 Shared Task.
In this task, named en-tities are given as gold-standard annotation andtheir relationships are to be extracted by identify-ing text spans, determining types, and assigningarguments.The predicted graphs were produced with thesystem developed for the BioNLP?09 Shared Taskby Bjo?rne et al (2010).
The system has twomachine-learning steps.
First, relationship nodesare predicted, one per token, based only on thesyntax and the given named entity nodes.
Next,outgoing edges are predicted for the relationshipnodes.
As a result, a projected graph is obtained.With the graph representation, the system cantransparently be trained for both the BioNLP?09Shared Task corpus and BioInfer regardless of thedifferences in their annotation schemes.The two prediction steps utilise theSVMmulticlass implementation of a multi-class support vector machine (Crammer andSinger, 2002; Tsochantaridis et al, 2004).
In thisstudy, the steps were independently optimisedfor model parameters and, in contrast to theoriginal training procedure, the recall boostingoptimisation was omitted due to limited resourcesavailable.
When training the edge prediction, thegold-standard relationship nodes were used.In the graph prediction, the conjunct depen-dency propagated parses produced with the parserof McClosky (2009) were systematically applied.3.2 ExperimentsOriginal gold-standard graphs were used in gen-erating decision tree models as well as subjectedto projection.
Predicted graphs and the projectedgold-standard graphs were deprojected with themodels.
The evaluation of the deprojected graphswas performed against the original graphs.During the system development, the trainingand development sets were available and the datawere thoroughly analysed.
The progress was esti-mated by training the system with the former andtesting against the latter.
The final results wereobtained on the test sets by applying the system112trained on the combined training?development set.For analysis, also the baseline method and themethod of Bjo?rne et al (2010) were evaluated onthe test sets.3.3 BaselinesThe baselines were designed to reflect an IE sys-tem following the one-node-per-token principlewithout an advanced postprocessing but still en-forcing the annotation scheme constraints.With the strict specifications of the BioNLP?09Shared Task, a sound baseline is obtained sim-ply by enforcing the constraints through a minimalset of changes.
Nodes with outgoing Cause andTheme edges are duplicated into all Cause?Themepairs.
Binding nodes remain unchanged since theycan have several Theme arguments while the oth-ers are treated as distributive nodes with distribu-tive incoming edges.Although BioInfer is less restricted with respectto valid argument combinations, a feasible base-line can be obtained by adapting the BioNLP?09Shared Task baseline algorithm.
Cause?Theme isreplaced with agent?patient while Binding is ex-tended to symmetric relationships (i.e.
participantarguments).
In addition, relationships with subarguments are treated as collective which reflectsmultiple components in a single complex.
Thesechanges were also applied to the method of Bjo?rneet al (2010) when analysing BioInfer.3.4 EvaluationThe standard precision?recall?F1 metrics wasused in the evaluation.
True/false positive/negativeinstances were determined by the equality of thenodes as relationships: pairs of equal nodes weretrue positives while unique nodes in the depro-jected and the original graph were false positivesand false negatives, respectively.The equality of references to text was deter-mined after removing the tokens found in a non-exhaustive list of common stop-words includingprepositions, articles, and non-alphanumeric char-acters.
This relaxes an unnecessary requirement ofthe node prediction step to find also those tokensin the BioInfer annotation that do not contribute tothe semantics of the nodes.
For example, preposi-tions should be associated with edges rather thannodes.The F1-scores were further analysed with theWilcoxon signed-rank test (Wilcoxon, 1945), asimplemented in Scipy v. 0.7.0, by consideringBioInfergold predictedmethod total symm.

Goldand predicted refer to the experiments with gold-standard and predicted graphs, respectively.each document as an experiment and using the95% confidence level.4 Results and discussionThe following discussion focuses on the deep re-lationship equality as the evaluation criterion be-cause it reflects the relationships of interest by re-quiring the identification of the pertaining namedentities.
Also, the discussion only considers theexperiments performed with the conjunct depen-dency propagated parses obtained with the parserof McClosky (2009) because switching parses didnot produce statistically significant differences inperformance.
Note that the results are not compa-rable to those of Bjo?rne et al (2010) because thegraph prediction was not fully optimised.With respect to the deprojection task, BioInferwas found to be similar to the BioNLP?09 SharedTask corpus: it contains symmetric relationships(c.f.
Binding), asymmetric relationships (c.f.
Reg-ulation), and single-argument relationships.
Onlythe symmetric relationships are a challenge in thedeprojection task because they can have an arbi-trary number of arguments.
In contrast, the base-line F1-scores for the others are above 94% on thegold-standard graphs.Table 1 shows the F1-scores on the test setsof BioInfer and the BioNLP?09 Shared Task cor-pus for the overall performance as well as forthe symmetric relationships only.
The proposedmethod outperforms the two other methods in all113experiments and the ?F1 against the proposedmethod are statistically significant with the ex-ception of the method of Bjo?rne et al (2010) onthe BioNLP?09 Shared Task corpus.
Althoughnot conclusively better than the earlier, specialisedmethod in its own task, the proposed methodsuccessfully achieves the intended generalisationwithout an adverse effect.The observed improvement over the method ofBjo?rne et al (2010) is likely due to two factors.First, using machine-learning rather than a sim-ple rule-based system allows for more accuratemodelling of the problem.
Second, the proposedmethod can handle a wider variety of cases due tothe classification of edges.
For example, the graphin Figure 4A can correctly be deprojected, whichis not possible for the earlier method.
However,the latter factor is only effective on BioInfer, themore complex of the two corpora, which is con-sistent with the observed statistical significances.The proposed deprojection method is currentlylimited to the phenomena encountered in the twoanalysed corpora since the decision to use binaryclassification was based on the experimental ob-servation that neither class is appropriate only inrare cases.
More classes will be needed to furthergeneralise and improve the system.
One such classcould be respective which denotes a selective pair-ing of sibling nodes.
For example, the sentence?A and B binds C and D, respectively?
currentlyresults in false positive pairs A?D and B?C.
Sim-ilarly, adding secondary arguments (e.g.
location)and relationship modifiers (e.g.
negation) into con-sideration is likely to necessitate new, more com-plex transformations and their respective classes.Also, to filter out incorrectly predicted edges willrequire the introduction of additional classes.
Thecritical question is whether a reasonably small setof classes with extensive enough a coverage canbe found.Another limitation is that the approach expectsan annotation scheme in which relationship argu-ments have the tendency of following syntacticdependencies as observed for BioInfer by Bjo?rneet al (2008).
This expectation may deteriorate theperformance on highly refined schemes which donot consider syntax.
On the other hand, since itrelies more on the syntactic than on the biolog-ical properties of the relationships, the proposedapproach should be applicable beyond the domainof biomolecular events (e.g.
to gene?disease rela-tionships or static relations).The F1-scores in Table 1 indicate that theBioNLP?09 Shared Task corpus is easier to ex-tract than BioInfer.
This is likely due to the nar-rower scope and the stricter constraints of theformer.
In absolute terms, the proposed methodyields the largest improvement over the baselineon the gold-standard graphs which suggests thatit is negatively affected by the presence of falsenodes/edges or that the predicted graphs containrelatively more relationships that are trivially de-projected.
On the other hand, in relative terms, thelargest improvements are observed for symmetricrelationships in the BioNLP?09 Shared Task cor-pus but overall in BioInfer.
This is likely due to thedifferences in the relationship type distributions.The system recently developed by Miwa et al(2010), based on the architecture of Bjo?rne et al(2010), utilises a ML-based deprojection whichenumerates all possible argument combinationsand classifies them as positive or negative.
Whilethis approach may be prohibitively expensive inmore complex schemes in which the number ofarguments and their types is higher, it should out-perform the proposed method on the BioNLP?09Shared Task corpus.
Since Miwa et al do notanalyse the contribution of the deprojection to theoverall performance, a direct comparison of thetwo methods is impossible.
In any case, the sys-tems of Bjo?rne et al (2010) and Miwa et al (2010)demonstrate the success of the architecture usingdeprojection and further motivate the investigationof deprojection methods.4.1 Future directionsIn the future, the proposed method will be stud-ied and further improved with two other corpora,GENIA Event Annotation (Kim et al, 2008) andGene Regulation Event Corpus (Thompson et al,2009), which are similar in their purpose com-pared to the already-analysed corpora.
The formercorpus is interesting because of the co-operativityof event participants which relaxes the restrictionson asymmetric relationships while the latter con-tains an extensive annotation for non-primary ar-guments.
The method could also be examinedwith the static relation extraction task recently in-troduced by Pyysalo et al (2009).In addition to improving the method and ex-tending it to non-primary arguments, embedding114the presented approach to a joint inference system,such as Markov Logic Network (MLN), will bestudied.
Deprojection is likely to greatly benefitmethods based on Markov Logic which is ?not yetable to deal with cases where the number and iden-tity of entities is unknown, while relations/linksbetween known objects can be readily modelled?
(Riedel et al, 2009).
The objective is to combinethe graph prediction and the deprojection stepsas well as to simultaneously enforce task-specificconstraints and adapt to the presence of false pos-itive nodes and edges.
This should be achiev-able by extending the methods developed for theBioNLP?09 Shared Task corpus by Riedel et al(2009) or by Poon and Vanderwende (2010), bothof which determine the correct argument combi-nations outside of the Markov Logic framework.Semantic role labelling (SRL) is a task simi-lar to the graph-based relationship extraction ap-plied in this paper although the former typicallyonly concerns shallow predicate?argument struc-tures (Hacioglu, 2004; Surdeanu et al, 2008).
Thesimilarities between the tasks suggest that explor-ing them jointly may benefit the development ofinformation extraction methods.In the long term, semantic schemes should bedeveloped such that, ideally, all syntactic tokensare considered for their semantics and semanticrelationships readily follow from their dependen-cies.
Such schemes, closely following the syn-tax, could improve both the graph prediction andthe deprojection.
In this research direction, graph-based knowledge representations such as concep-tual graphs (Sowa, 1976; Chein and Mugnier,2008) or graphical logical forms such as the oneproposed by Allen et al (2008) could be adopted.Given the frequency of coordinations in thebiomedical domain, deprojection may prove tobe useful in the development of deep semanticparsing in the biomedical domain.
For example,with improved semantic schemes, it could providea means to generate complete, detailed semanticgraphs directly from deep dependency analyses ina single-step by applying joint inference to achievesimultaneous node/edge relabelling and graph de-projection.5 ConclusionsThis study presents a method for reconstructingthe original semantic graphs from their projectionsby determining the correct combinations of rela-tionship arguments.
It generalises the postprocess-ing step of the system described by Bjo?rne et al(2010) and extends the extraction capability of thissystem to arbitrary graphs of nested biomolecularrelationships.
The evaluation of the method onBioInfer and the BioNLP?09 Shared Task corpusindicates that the approach is viable for primaryrelationship arguments.
For BioInfer, the outcomeis, to the best of our knowledge, the first reportedresult of the task of extracting the nested relation-ships in its original version.The presented method facilitates an IE approachin which the identification of semantic entities isperformed on the one-entity-per-token basis andrelationship arguments are identified in a mutu-ally independent manner disregarding the seman-tics of the argument combinations.
The methodhandles the selection of the correct argument com-binations, which is non-trivial particularly whencoordinations are involved, and generates the finaloutput in which a single token can refer to severalentities.
This approach improves the utilisation ofdeep dependency analyses by simplifying the cor-relation between them and semantic graphs.
Dueto its independent nature, the method can be cou-pled to any system identifying relationships on theone-per-token basis.The implemented system will be available uponrequest.AcknowledgementsThanks to Filip Ginter for his help with theparses.
