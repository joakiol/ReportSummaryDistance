Sublanguages differ from each other, and tron}.the "standard language, in their syntactic, ~ant ic ,  antidiscourse properties.
We describe ~ some rec~.twork on (-senii-)automatically determining the.syntactic_properties of several sublangnages.
This work m part ota larger effort aimed at improving the techniques forparsing sublanguages.If we esamine a variety of scientific and technicalsublanguages, we will encounter most of the constructs ofthe standard language, plus a number of syntactic exten-sions.
For example, report" sublantgnag ~, such as areused in medical s||mmarles and eqmpment failure sum-maries, include both full sentences and a number of ~ag-merit forms \[Marsh 1983\].
Specific sublanguages differin their usage of these syntactic onstructs \[Kittredge1982, Lehrberger 1982\].Identifying these differences i important in under-standing how sublanguages differ from the Language as awhole.
It also has immediate practical benefits, since itallows us to trim our grammar tO fit the specific sub-language we are processing.
This can significantly speedup the analysis process and bl~.k some spurious parseswhich wouldbe obtained with a grammar of Overly broadcoverage.Determining Syntaai?

We nave mere-fore chosen to automate this process.We are fortunate to have available to us a verybroad coverage English grammar, the Linguistic.St~ingGrammar \[S~gor 1981\], which hp been ex~.

sampl~from two Sublanguages.
The .fi~s.
t is a set o.x s~ pauentdocuments (including patient his.tm'y., eTam,n.ation, .andplan of treatment).
The second m a set ot electricalequipment failure relxals called "CASREPs', a class ofoperational report used by the U. S. Navy \[Froscher1983\].
The parse file for the patient documents hadcorrect parses for 236 sentences (and sentence frag-ments); the file for the CASREPS had correct parses tor123 sentences.
We have recently applied the process, to athird text sample, drawn from a subIanguage v ry stmflarto the first: a set of five hospital discharge summaries ,Which include patient histories, e~nmlnnt\[ous, and sum-maries of the murse of treatment in the hospital.
Thislast sample included correct parses for 310 sentences.96ResultsThe trimmed grarnrtl~l~ du~ from thc threesublanguage t xt samples were of comparable size.
Thegrammar produced from the first set of patient docu-menU; col~tained 129 non-termlnal symbols and 248 pro-ductions; the grnmmar from the second set (the"discharge summaries") Was Slightly \]~trger, with 134non-termin~ds and 282 productions.
The grammar for theCASREP sublanguage was slightly smaller, with 124non-terminal~ and 220 productions (this is probably areflection of the smaller size of the CASR text sam-ple).
These figures compare with 255 non-termlnal sym-bols and 744 productions in the "medical records" gram-mar used by the New York University Linguistic StringPro~=t (the "medical records" grammar iS the LingttisticString Project English Grammar with extensions for sen-tencc fragments and other, sublanguagc specific, con-structs, and with a few options deleted).Figures 1 and 2 show the cumulative growth in thesize of the I~"immed grammars for the three sublanguagesas a function of the number of sentences in the sample.In Ftgure 1 we plot the number of non-term/hal symbolsin the grammar as a function of sample size; in Figure 2,the number of productions in the ~ as a functionof sample size.
Note that the curves for the two medicalsublanguages (curves A and B) have pretty much fiat-tcned out toward the end, indicating that, by that point,the trimmed grnmm~tr COVe'S a V~"y lar~ fra~on of thesentences in the sublanguage.
(Some of the jumps in thegrowth curves for the medical grAmmarS refleet he ~vi-sion of the patient documents into sections (history, pl3y-sical exam, lab tests, etc.)
with different syntactic charac-teristics.
For the first few documents, wl3en a new see-tion bedim, constructs are encountered which did notappear m prior sections, thus producing a jump in thec11rve.
)The sublanguage gramma~ arc substantially smallerthan the full English grammar, reflecting the more lim-itcd range of modifiers and complements in these sub-languages.
While the full grammar has 67 options forsentence object, the sublanguage rammars have substan-tially restricted mages: each of the three sublanguagegrammars has only 14 object options.
Further, the gram-mars greatly overlap, so that the three grammars com-bined contain only 20 different object options.
Whilesentential complements of nouns are available in the fullgrammar, there arc no i~tanc~ of such a:~\[lstrllcfions ineither medical sublanguage, aad only one instance in theCASREP sublanguage.
The range of modifiers iS alsomuch restricted ia the sublangu=age rammars as com-pared to the full grammar.
15 options for sententialmodifiers are available in the full grammar.
These arerestricted to 9 in the first medical sample, 11 in thesecond, and 8 in the equipment failure sublangua~e.Similarly, the full English gr~mmnr has 21 options torright modifiers of nouns; the sublanguage r~mma_~S hadfewer, 11 in the first medical sumple, I0 m" the second,and 7 in the CASREP sublanguage.
Here the sub-language grammars overlap almost completely: only 12different right modifiers of  noun are represented in thethree grammars combined.Among the options occurring in all the sublanguagegrammars, their relative frequency varies ao~o~ding tothe domain of the text.
For example, the frequency ofprepositional phrases as right modifiers of nouns (meas;urea as instances per sentence or sentence fragment) was0.36 and 0.46 for the two medical samples, as comparedto 0.77 for the CASREPs.
More striking was the fre-quency of noun phrases with nouns as modifiers of othernouns: 0.20 and 0.32 for the two medical ~mples,versus 0.80 for the CASREPs.We reparsed some of the sentences from the first setof medical documents with the trimmed grammar and, as~ ,  o.bserved a considerable " speed-up.
Thet.mgumuc ~mng rarser uses a p.op-uown pa.~mg algo-rithm with.,  .ba~track~" g. A,~Ldingly , for short, simplesentences which require little backtr~.king there was onlya small gain in processing speed (about 25%).
For long,complex sentences, however, which require extensivebacktracking, the speed-up (by roughly a factor of 3) wasapproximately proportional to the reduction in thenumber of productions.
In addition, the ~fyequcncy ofbad parses decreased slightly (by <3%) with thel~mmed y .mm.r  (because some of the bad parsesinvolved syntactic onstructs which did not appear m anyo~,,~ect parse in the sublanguage sample).DiscussionAs natural .lan..~,uage interfaces become moremature, their portability .- the ability to move an inter-face to a new domain and sublenguage -.
is becomingincreasingly important.
At 8 minimllm, portabilityrequires us to isolate the domain dependent informationin a natural \]aDgua.~.e system \[C~OSZ 1983, Gri~hman1983\].
A more ambitious goal m to provide a discoveryprocedure for this information -.
a procedure Wl~eh candetermine the domain dependent information from sam-ple texts in the sublanguage.
The tcchnklUeS describedabove provide a partial, semi-automatic discovery pro-cedure for the syntactic usages of a sublangua~.
* Byapplying .these .
t~gues  to a small sub lan~ sample,we ~ adapt a broad-coverage rammar tO the syntax ofa particular sublanguage.
Sub~.quont text from this sub-language caa then be i~xessed more efficiently.We are currently extending this work in two direc-tions.
For sentences with two or more parses which~ atisfy .both the syntactic and the sublanguage s lectional semanu.
'c) onstraints, we intena to try using the/re-Cency information ga~ered for productions to select, ainvol "ving the more frequent syntactic constructs.
**Second, we are using a s~milAr approach to develop adiscovery procedure for sublanguage s lectional patterns.We are collecting, from the same sublanguage samples,statistics on the frequency of co-occurrence of particularsublan .guage (semantic) classes in subjeet.vedy.ob~:ct andhost-adjunct relations, and are using this data as input to* Partial, because it cannot identify new extensionsto the base gramme; semi-automatic, because theparses produced with the broad-coverage rammar?
must be manually reviewed.
* Some small experiments of this type have beenone with a Japanese ~ \[Naga 0 1982\] with1|mired success.
Becat~ of the v~_ differ~t na-ture of the grammar, however, it is not dearwhether this lass any implications for our experi-ments.97the grammar's ublanguage s lectional restrictions.AcknowledgemeatThis material is based upon work supported by theNalional Science Foundation under Grants No.
