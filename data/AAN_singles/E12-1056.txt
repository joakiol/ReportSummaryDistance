We utilized Subcat-LMF to standardize lexicons with large-scale SCF information: the English Verb-Net and two German lexicons, i.e., a subsetof IMSlex and GermaNet verbs.
To evalu-ate our LMF-model, we performed a cross-lingual comparison of SCF coverage andoverlap for the standardized versions of theEnglish and German lexicons.
The Subcat-LMF DTD, the conversion tools and thestandardized versions of VerbNet and IMS-lex subset are publicly available.11 IntroductionComputational lexicons providing accuratelexical-syntactic information, such as subcatego-rization frames (SCFs) are vital for many NLPapplications involving parsing and word sensedisambiguation.
In parsing, SCFs have beensuccessfully used to improve the output of sta-tistical parsers (Klenner (2007), Deoskar (2008),Sigogne et al(2011)) which is particularlysignificant in high-precision domain-independentparsing.
In word sense disambiguation, SCFshave been identified as important features forverb sense disambiguation (Brown et al 2011),which is due to the correlation of verb senses andSCFs (Andrew et al 2004).SCFs specify syntactic arguments of verbs andother predicate-like lexemes, e.g.
the verb say1http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/ubytakes two arguments that can be realized, for in-stance, as noun phrase and that-clause as in Hesays that the window is open.Although a number of freely available, large-scale and accurate SCF lexicons exist, e.g.
COM-LEX (Grishman et al 1994), VerbNet (Kipperet al 2008) for English, availability and limita-tions in size and coverage remain an inherent is-sue.
This applies even more to languages otherthan English.One particular approach to address this issue isthe combination and integration of existing man-ually built SCF lexicons.
Lexicon integrationhas widely been adopted for increasing the cover-age of lexicons regarding lexical-semantic infor-mation types, such as semantic roles, selectionalrestrictions, and word senses (e.g., Shi and Mi-halcea (2005), the Semlink project2, Navigli andPonzetto (2010), Niemann and Gurevych (2011),Meyer and Gurevych (2011)).Currently, SCFs are represented idiosyncrati-cally in existing SCF lexicons.
However, inte-gration of SCFs requires a common, interopera-ble representation format.
Monolingual SCF in-tegration based on a common representation for-mat has already been addressed by King andCrouch (2005) and just recently by Necsulescu etal.
(2011) and Padro?
et al(2011).
However, nei-ther King and Crouch (2005) nor Necsulescu etal.
(2011) or Padro?
et al(2011) make use of ex-isting standards in order to create a uniform SCFrepresentation for lexicon merging.
The defini-tion of an interoperable representation format ac-cording to an existing standard, such as the ISOstandard Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO24613:2008, see Francopoulo et al(2006)), is the2http://verbs.colorado.edu/semlink/550prerequisite for re-using this format in differentcontexts, thus contributing to the standardizationand interoperability of language resources.While LMF models exist that cover the rep-resentation of SCFs (see Quochi et al(2008),Buitelaar et al(2009)), their suitability for repre-senting SCFs at a large scale remains unclear: nei-ther of these LMF-models has been used for stan-dardizing lexicons with a large number of SCFs,such as VerbNet.
Furthermore, the question oftheir applicability to different languages has notbeen investigated yet, a situation that is compli-cated by the fact that SCFs are highly language-specific.The goal of this paper is to address these gapsfor the two languages English and German by pre-senting a uniform LMF representation of SCFsfor English and German which is utilized for thestandardization of large-scale English and Ger-man SCF lexicons.
The contributions of thispaper are threefold: (1) We present the LMFmodel Subcat-LMF, an LMF-compliant lexiconrepresentation format featuring a uniform andvery fine-grained representation of SCFs for En-glish and German.
Subcat-LMF is a subset ofUby-LMF (Eckle-Kohler et al 2012), the LMFmodel of the large integrated lexical resource Uby(Gurevych et al 2012).
(2) We convert lexiconswith large-scale SCF information to Subcat-LMF:the English VerbNet and two German lexicons,i.e., GermaNet (Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2002) anda subset of IMSlex3 (Eckle-Kohler, 1999).
(3) Weperform a comparison of these three lexicons re-garding SCF coverage and SCF overlap, based onthe standardized representation.The remainder of this paper is structured as fol-lows: Section 2 gives a detailed description ofSubcat-LMF and section 3 demonstrates its use-fulness for representing and cross-lingually com-paring large-scale English and German lexicons.Section 4 provides a discussion including relatedwork and section 5 concludes.2 Subcat-LMF2.1 ISO-LMF: a meta-modelLMF defines a meta-model of lexical resources,covering NLP lexicons and Machine ReadableDictionaries.
This meta-model is based on theUnified Modeling Language (UML) and speci-3http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/IMSLex/fies a core package and a number of extensionsfor modeling different types of lexicons, includ-ing subcategorization lexicons.The development of an LMF-compliant lexi-con model requires two steps: in the first step,the structure of the lexicon model has to be de-fined by choosing a combination of the LMF corepackage and zero to many extensions (i.e.
UMLpackages).
While the LMF core package modelsa lexicon in terms of lexical entries, each of whichis defined as the pairing of one to many forms andzero to many senses, the LMF extensions provideUML classes for different types of lexicon orga-nization, e.g., covering the synset-based organiza-tion of WordNet and the class-based organizationof VerbNet.
The first step results in a set of UMLclasses that are associated according to the UMLdiagrams given in ISO LMF.In the second step, these UML classes may beenriched by attributes.
While neither attributesnor their values are given by the standard, thestandard states that both are to be linked to DataCategories (DCs) defined in a Data Category Reg-istry (DCR) such as ISOCat.4 DCs that are notavailable in ISOCat may be defined and submit-ted for standardization.
The second step results ina so-called Data Category Selection (DCS).DCs specify the linguistic vocabulary used inan LMF model.
Consider as an example thelinguistic term direct object that often occurs inSCFs of verbs taking an accusative NP as argu-ment.
In ISOCat, there are two different specifi-cations of this term, one explicitly referring to thecapability of becoming the clause subject in pas-sivization5, the other not mentioning passivizationat all.6 Consequently, the use of a DCR plays amajor role regarding the semantic interoperabilityof lexicons (Ide and Pustejovsky, 2010).
Differentresources that share a common definition of theirlinguistic vocabulary are said to be semanticallyinteroperable.2.2 Fleshing out ISO-LMFApproach: We started our development ofSubcat-LMF with a thorough inspection of large-scale English and German resources providingSCFs for verbs, nouns, and adjectives.
For4http://www.isocat.org/, the implementation of the ISO12620 DCR (Broeder et al 2010).5http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-12746http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-2263551English, our analysis included VerbNet7 andFrameNet syntactically annotated example sen-tences from Ruppenhofer et al(2010).
For Ger-man, we inspected GermaNet, SALSA annota-tion guidelines (Burchardt et al 2006) and IM-Slex documentation (Eckle-Kohler, 1999).
In ad-dition, the EAGLES synopsis on morphosyntacticphenomena8 (Calzolari and Monachini, 1996), aswell as the EAGLES recommendations on subcat-egorization9 have been used to identify DCs rele-vant for SCFs.We specified Subcat-LMF by a DTD yieldingan XML serialization of ISO-LMF.
Thus, existinglexicons can be standardized, i.e.
converted intoSubcat-LMF format, based on the DTD.10Lexicon structure: Next, we defined thelexicon structure of Subcat-LMF.
In additionto the core package, Subcat-LMF primarilymakes use of the LMF Syntax and Seman-tics extension.
Figure 1 shows the mostimportant classes of Subcat-LMF includingSynsemCorrespondence where the linking ofsyntactic and semantic arguments is encoded.
Itmight by worth noting that both synsets from Ger-maNet and verb classes from VerbNet can be rep-resented in Subcat-LMF by using the Synset andSubcategorizationFrameSet class.Diverging linguistic properties of SCFs inEnglish and German: For verbs (and also forpredicate-like nouns and adjectives), SCFs spec-ify the syntactic and morphosyntactic propertiesof their arguments that have to be present in con-crete realizations of these arguments within a sen-tence.
While some properties of syntactic argu-ments in English and German correspond (bothEnglish and German are Germanic languages andhence closely related), there are other properties,mainly morphosyntactic ones that diverge.
Byway of examples, we illustrate some of these di-vergences in the following (we contrast Englishexamples with their German equivalents):?
overt case marking in German:He helps him.
vs. Er hilft ihm.
(dative)?
specific verb form in verb phrase arguments:He suggested cleaning the house.

(to-infinitive)?
morphosyntactic marking of verb phrase ar-guments in the main clause: He managed towin.
(no marking) vs.Er hat es geschafft zu gewinnen.
(obligatoryes)?
morphosyntactic marking of clausal argu-ments in the main clause: That depends onwho did it.
(preposition) vs.Das ha?ngt davon ab, wer es getan hat.
(pronominal adverb)Uniform Data Categories for English and Ger-man: Thus, the main challenge in developingSubcat-LMF has been the specification of DCs(attributes and attribute values) in such a way,that a uniform specification of SCFs in the twolanguages English and German can be achieved.The specification of DCs for Subcat-LMF in-volved fleshing out ISO-LMF, because it is ameta-standard in the sense that it provides onlyfew linguistic terms, i.e.
DCs, and these DCsare not linked to any DCR: in the Syntax Exten-sion, the standard only provides 7 class names,see Figure 1), complemented by 17 example at-tributes given in an informative, non-binding An-nex F. These are by far not sufficient to repre-sent the fine-grained SCFs available in such large-scale lexicons as VerbNet.In contrast, the Syntax part of Subcat-LMFcomprises 58 DCs that are properly linked toISOCat DCs; a number of DCs were missing inISOCat, so we entered them ourselves.11 Themajority of the attributes in Subcat-LMF are at-tached to the SyntacticArgument class.
Thecorresponding DCs can be divided into two maingroups:Cross-lingually valid DCs for the spec-ification of grammatical functions (e.g.subject, prepositionalComplement)and syntactic categories (e.g.
nounPhrase,prepositionalPhrase), see Table 1.Partly language-specific morphosyntacticDCs that further specify the syntactic arguments(e.g.
attribute case, attribute verbForm and11The Subcat-LMF DCS is publicly available on the ISO-Cat website.552Figure 1: Selected classes of Subcat-LMF.Values of grammaticalFunction Examplesubject They arrived in time.subjectComplement He becomes a teacher.directObject He saw a rainbow.objectComplement They elected him governor.complement He told him a story.prepositionalComplement It depends on several factors.adverbialComplement They moved far away.Values of syntacticCategory ExamplenounPhrase The train stopped.reflexive He drank himself sick.expletive It is raining.prepositionalPhrase It depends on several factors.adverbPhrase They moved far away.adjectivePhrase The light turned red.verbPhrase She tried to exercise.declarativeClause He says he agrees.subordinateClause He believes that it works.Table 1: Cross-lingually valid (English-German) attributes and values of the SyntacticArgument class.values toInfinitive, bareInfinitive,ingForm, participle), see Table 2.In the class LexemeProperty, we introducedan attribute syntacticProperty to encodecontrol and raising properties of verbs taking in-finitival verb phrase arguments.12In Subcat-LMF, syntactic arguments can bespecified by a selection of appropriate attribute-value pairs.
While all syntactic arguments are uni-formly specified by a grammatical function and asyntactic category, the use of the morphosyntacticattributes depends on the particular type of syn-tactic argument.
Different phrase types are spec-12Control or raising specify the co-reference between theimplicit subject of the infinitival argument and syntactic ar-guments in the main clause, either the subject (subject con-trol or raising) or direct object (object control or raising).ified by different subsets of morphosyntactic at-tributes, see Table 2.

).3 Utilizing Subcat-LMF3.1 Standardizing large-scale lexiconsLexicon Data: We converted VerbNet (VN) andtwo German lexicons, i.e., GermaNet (GN) anda subset of IMSlex (ILS) to Subcat-LMF format.ILS has been developed independently from GNand the lexicon data were published in Eckle-Kohler (1999).VN is organized in verb classes based on Levin-style syntactic alternations (Levin, 1993): verbswith common SCFs and syntactic alternation be-havior that also share common semantic roles aregrouped into classes.
VN (version 3.1) lists 568frames that are encoded as phrase structure rules(XML element SYNTAX), specifying phrase typesand semantic roles of the arguments, as well as se-lectional, syntactic and morphosyntactic restric-tions on the arguments.
Additionally, a descrip-tive specification of each frame is given (XMLelement DESCRIPTION).
The verb learn, for in-stance, has the following VN frame:DESCRIPTION (primary): NP V NPSYNTAX: Agent V TopicWe extracted both the descriptive specificationsand the phrase structure rules, using the APIavailable for VN13, resulting in 682 unique VNframes.14GN provides detailed SCFs for verbs, incontrast to the Princeton WordNet: GN version6.0 from April 2011 accessed by the GN API15lists 202 frames.
GN SCFs are represented as a13http://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/inspector/14The VN API was used with the view options wrexyzsqfor verb frame pairs and ctuqw for verb class information.15GermaNet Java API 2.0.2dot-separated sequence of letter pairs.
Each letterpair specifies a syntactic argument: the first letterencodes the grammatical function and the secondletter the syntactic category.16 For instance, thefollowing shows the GN code for transitive verbs:NN.AN.ILS is represented in delimiter-separatedvalues format and contains 784 verbs in total.Of these 784 verbs, 740 of them are also presentin GN, and 44 are listed in ILS only.
AlthoughILS contains only verbs that take clausal ar-guments and verb phrase arguments, a totalnumber of 220 SCFs is present in ILS, alsoincluding SCFs without clausal and verb phrasearguments.
ILS lists for each verb lemma anumber of SCFs, thus specifying coarse-grainedverb senses given by a lemma-SCF pair.17 TheSCFs are represented as parenthesized lists.
Forinstance, the ILS SCF for transitive verbs is:(subj(NPnom),obj(NPacc)).Automatic Conversion: We implemented Javatools for the conversion of VN, GN and ILS toSubcat-LMF.
These tools convert the source lexi-cons based on a manual mapping of lexicon unitsand terms (e.g., VN verb class, GN synset) toSubcat-LMF.
For the majority of SCFs, this map-ping is defined on argument level.
Lexical datais extracted from the source lexicons by using thenative APIs (VN, GN) and additional Perl scripts.16See http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/GermaNet/-verb frames.shtml17In addition, ILS provides a semantic class label for eachverb; however, these semantic labels are attached at lemmalevel, i.e.
they need to be disambiguated.554# LexicalEntry # Sense # Subcat.Frame # SemanticPred.LMF-VN 3962 31891 284 617orig.

Numbers of Subcat-LMF instances in the converted lexiconscompared to numbers of corresponding units in original lexicons.Evaluation of Automatic Conversion: Table 3shows the mapping of the major source lexiconunits (such as verb-synset pairs) to Subcat-LMFand lists the corresponding numbers of units.For VN, groups of VN verb, frame and se-mantic predicate have been mapped to LMFsenses.
VN classes have been mapped toSubcategorizationFrameSet.
Thus, theoriginal VN-sense, a pairing of verb lemma andclass, can be recovered by grouping LMF sensesthat share the same verb class.
There is a signif-icant difference between the original VN framesand their Subcat-LMF representation: the seman-tic information present in VN frames (seman-tic roles and selectional restrictions) is mappedto semantic arguments in Subcat-LMF, i.e.
themapping splits VN frames into a purely syntac-tic and a purely semantic part.
Consequently,the number of unique SCFs in the Subcat-LMFversion of VN is much smaller than the num-ber of frames in the original VN.
The conversiontool creates for each sense (specifying a uniqueverb, frame, semantic predicate combination) aSynSemCorrespondence.On the other hand, the Subcat-LMF version of VNcontains more semantic predicates than VN.
Thisis due to selectional restrictions for semantic ar-guments that are specified in Subcat-LMF withinsemantic predicates, in contrast to VN.For GN, verb-synset pairs (i.e., GN lexicalunits), have been mapped to LMF senses.
FewGN frame codes also specify semantic role in-formation, e.g.
manner, location.
These weremapped to the semantics part of Subcat-LMF re-sulting in 84 semantic predicates that encode thesemantic role information in their semantic argu-ments.ILS specifies similar semantic role informationas GN; these few cases were mapped in the sameway as for GN.
Therefore, the LMF version ofILS, too, specifies less SCFs, but additional se-mantic predicates not present in the original.Discussion: Grammatical functions of argu-ments are specified distinctly in the three lexicons.While both GN and ILS specify grammaticalfunctions, they are not explicitly encoded in VN.They have to be inferred on the basis of the phrasestructure rules given in the SYNTAX element.
Weassigned subject to the noun phrase which di-rectly precedes the verb and directObject tothe noun phrase directly following the verb andhaving the semantic role Patient.
The semanticrole information has to be considered at this point,because not all noun phrase arguments are ableto become the subject in a corresponding passivesentence.
An example is the verb learn whichhas the VN frame NP(Agent) V NP(Topic);here, the Topic-NP is not able to become the sub-ject of a corresponding passive sentence.
We as-signed the grammatical function complement toall other phrase types.Argument order constraints in SCFs are repre-sented in LMF by a list implementation of syntac-tic arguments.
Most SCFs from VN require thesubject to be the first argument, reflecting the ba-sic word order in English sentences.
VN lists oneexception to this rule for the verb appear, illus-trated by the example On the horizon appears aship.Argument optionality in VN is expressed at thesemantic level and at the syntactic level in paral-lel: it is explicitly specified at the semantic leveland implicitly specified at the syntactic level.
Atthe syntactic level, two SCF versions exist in VN,one with the optional argument, the other withoutit.
In addition, the semantic predicate attached to555these SCFs marks optional (semantic) argumentsby a ?-sign.
GN, on the other hand, expressesargument optionality at the level of syntactic ar-guments, i.e., within the frame code.
In Subcat-LMF, optionality is represented at the syntacticlevel by an (optional) attribute optional for syn-tactic arguments, thus reflecting the explicit repre-sentation used in GN and the implicit representa-tion present in VN.18GN frames specify syntactic alternations of ar-gument realizations, e.g.
adverbial complementsthat can alternatively be realized as adverb phrase,prepositional phrase or noun phrase.
We encodedthis generalization in Subcat-LMF by introducingattribute values for these aggregated syntactic cat-egories.3.2 Cross-lingual comparison of lexiconsLexicons that are standardized according toSubcat-LMF can be quantitatively compared re-garding SCFs.
For two lexicons, such a com-parison gives answers to questions, such as: howmany SCFs are present in both lexicons (overlap-ping SCFs), how many SCFs are only listed in oneof the lexicons (complementary SCFs).
Answersto these questions are important, for instance, forassessing the potential gain in SCF coverage thatcan be achieved by lexicon merging.In order to validate our claim that Subcat-LMFyields a cross-lingually uniform SCF represen-tation, we contrast the monolingual comparisonof GN and ILS with the cross-lingual compari-son of VN, GN and VN and ILS.
Assuming thatour claim is valid, the cross-lingual comparisonscan be expected to yield similar results regard-ing overlapping and complementary SCFs as themonolingual comparison.Comparison: The comparison of SCFs fromtwo lexicons that are in Subcat-LMF format canbe performed on the basis of the uniform DCs.As Subcat-LMF is implemented in XML, wecompared string representations of SCFs.
SCFsfrom VN, GN and ILS were converted to stringsby concatenating attribute values of syntactic ar-guments and lexemeProperty.
We createdstring representations of different granularities:First, fine-grained, language-specific string SCFshave been generated by concatenating all at-18As a consequence, all semantic arguments specified inthe Subcat-LMF version of VN have a corresponding syn-tactic argument.tribute values apart from the attribute optionalwhich is specific to GN (resulting in a consid-erably smaller number of SCFs in GN).
Sec-ond, fine-grained, but cross-lingual string SCFswere considered; these omit the attributes case,lexeme, preposition and the attribute valueingForm.
Finally, coarse-grained cross-lingualstring SCFs were compared.
These only con-tain the values of the attributes syntacticcategory, complementizer and verbForm(without the attribute value ingForm).
For in-stance, a coarse cross-lingual string SCF for tran-sitive verbs is nounPhrasenounPhrase.Table 4 lists the results of our quantitative com-parison.
For each lexicon pair, the number ofoverlapping SCFs and the numbers of comple-mentary SCFs are given.
Regarding VN and theGerman lexicons, the overlap at the language-specific level is (close to) zero, which is due to thespecification of case, e.g.
dative, for German ar-guments.
However, the numbers for cross-lingualSCFs clearly validate our claim: the numbers ofoverlapping SCFs for the German lexicon pair andfor the two German-English pairs are comparable,ranging from 12 to 18 for the fine-grained SCFsand from 20 to 21 for the coarse SCFs.Based on the sets of cross-lingually overlap-ping SCFs, we made an estimation on how manyhigh frequent verbs actually have SCFs that arein the cross-lingual SCF overlap of an English-German lexicon pair.
For this, we used the lemmafrequency lists of the English and German WaCkycorpora (Baroni et al 2009) and extracted verbsfrom VN, GN and ILS that are on 100 top rankedpositions of these lists, starting from rank 100.19Table 5 shows the results for the cross-lingualSCF overlap between VN ?
GN and between VN?
ILS.
While only around 40% of the high fre-quent verbs have an SCF in the fine-grained SCFoverlap, more than 70% are in the coarse overlapbetween VN ?
GN, and even more than 80% inthe coarse overlap between VN ?
ILS.Analysis of results: The small numbers ofoverlapping cross-lingual SCFs (relative to the to-tal number of SCFs), at both levels of granularity,indicate that the three lexicons each encode sub-stantially different lexical-syntactic properties of19Since the WaCky frequency lists do not contain POS in-formation, our lists of extracted verbs contain some noise,which we tolerated, because we aimed at an approximate es-timate.556language-specific cross-lingual cross-lingual(fine-grained) (fine-grained) (coarse)GN vs. ILS 72 GN 21 both, 196 ILS 61 GN, 23 both, 69 ILS 40 GN, 24 both, 23 ILSVN vs. GN 284 VN, 0 both, 93 GN 96 VN, 15 both, 69 GN 29 VN, 24 both, 40 GNVN vs. ILS 283 VN, 1 both, 216 ILS 93 VN, 18 both, 74 ILS 31 VN, 22 both, 25 ILSTable 4: Comparison of lexicon pairs regarding SCF overlap and complementary SCFs.VN-GN overlap VN-GN overlap VN-ILS overlap VN-ILS overlapfine-grained (15 SCFs) coarse (24 SCFs) fine-grained (18 SCFs) coarse (22 SCFs)43% VN verbs 85% VN verbs 41% VN verbs 84% VN verbs41% GN verbs 71% GN verbs 43% ILS verbs 87% ILS verbsTable 5: Percentage of 100 high frequent verbs from VN, GN, ILS with a SCF in the cross-lingual SCF overlap(fine-grained vs. coarse) between VN ?

This can at least partly be explained by thehistoric development of these lexicons in differ-ent contexts, e.g., Levin?s work on verb classes(VN), Lexical Functional Grammar (ILS), as wellas their use for different purposes and applica-tions.Another reason of the small SCF overlap isthe comparison of strings derived from the XMLformat.
A more sophisticated representation for-mat, notably one that provides semantic typingand type hierarchies, e.g., OWL, could be em-ployed to define hierarchies of grammatical func-tions (e.g.
direct object would be a sub-type ofcomplement) and other attributes.
These wouldpresumably support the identification of furtheroverlapping SCFs.During a subsequent qualitative analysis of theoverlapping and complementary SCFs, we col-lected some enlightening background informa-tion.
Overlapping SCFs in the cross-lingual com-parison (both fine-grained and coarse) includeprominent SCFs corresponding to transitive andintransitive verbs, as well as verbs with that-clause and verbs with to-infinitive.GN and ILS are highly complementary regard-ing SCFs: for instance, while many SCFs with ad-verbial arguments are unique in GN, only ILS pro-vides a fine-grained specification of prepositionalcomplements including the preposition, as wellas the case the preposition requires.20 VN, too,contains a large number of SCFs with a detailedspecification of possible prepositions, partly spec-20In German, prepositions govern the case of their nounphrase.ified as language-independent preposition types.A large number of complementary SCFs in VNvs.
GN and GN vs. ILS are due to a diverging lin-guistic analysis of extraposed subject clauses withan es (it) in the main clause (e.g., It annoys himthat the train is late.).
In GN, such clauses are notspecified as subject, whereas in VN and ILS theyare.Regarding VN and ILS, only VN lists subjectcontrol for verbs, while both VN and ILS list ob-ject control and subject raising.
GN, on the otherhand, does not specify control or raising at all.4 Discussion4.1 Previous WorkMerging SCFs: Previous work on merging SCFlexicons has only been performed in a mono-lingual setting and lacks the use of standards.King and Crouch (2005) describe the process ofunifying several large-scale verb lexicons for En-glish, including VN and WordNet.
They performa conversion of these lexicons into a uniform, butnon-standard representation format, resulting in alexicon which is integrated at the level of verbsenses, SCFs and lexical-semantics.
Thus, the re-sult of their work is not applicable to cross-lingualsettings.Necsulescu et al(2011) and Padro?
et al(2011)report on approaches to automatic merging oftwo Spanish SCF lexicons.
As these lexiconslack sense information apart from the SCFs, theirmerging approach only works on a very coarse-grained sense level given by lemma-SCF pairs.The fully automatic merging approach described557in (Padro?
et al 2011) assumes that one of the lex-icons to be integrated is already represented in thetarget representation format, i.e.
given two lexi-cons, they map one lexicon to the format of theother.
Moreover, their approach requires a signif-icant overlap of SCFs and verbs in any two lex-icons to be merged.
The authors state that it ispresently unclear, how much overlap is requiredto obtain sufficiently precise merging results.Standardizing SCFs: Much previous work onstandardizing NLP lexicons in LMF has focusedon WordNet-like resources.
Soria et al(2009) de-scribe WordNet-LMF, an LMF model for repre-senting wordnets which has been used in the KY-OTO project.21 Later, WordNet-LMF has beenadapted by Henrich and Hinrichs (2010) to Ger-maNet and by Toral et al(2010) to the Ital-ian WordNet.
WordNet-LMF does not providethe possibility to represent subcategorization atall.
The adaption of WordNet-LMF to GN (Hen-rich and Hinrichs, 2010) allows SCFs to be re-spresented as string values.
However, this ex-tension is not sufficient, because it provides nomeans to model the syntax-semantics interface,which specifies correspondences between syntac-tic and semantic arguments of verbs and otherpredicates.
Quochi et al(2008) report on an LMFmodel that covers the syntax-semantics mappingjust mentioned; it has been used for standardizingan Italian domain-specific lexicon.
Buitelaar et al(2009) describe LexInfo, an LMF-model that isused for lexicalizing ontologies.
LexInfo is imple-mented in OWL and specifies a linking of syntac-tic and semantic arguments.
For SCFs and argu-ments, a type hierarchy is defined.
In their paper,Buitelaar et al(2009) show only few SCFs anddo not indicate what kinds of SCFs can be repre-sented with LexInfo in principle.
On the LexInfowebsite22, the current LexInfo version 2.0 can beviewed, but no further documentation is given.We inspected LexInfo version 2.0 and found thatit specifies a large number of fine-grained SCFs.However, LexInfo has not been evaluated so faron large-scale SCF lexicons, such as VerbNet.4.2 Subcat-LMFSubcat-LMF enables the uniform representationof fine-grained SCFs across the two languagesEnglish and German.
By mapping large-scale21http://www.kyoto-project.eu/22See http://lexinfo.net/SCF lexicons to Subcat-LMF, we have demon-strated its usability for uniformly representing awide range of SCFs and other lexical-syntactic in-formation types in English and German.As our cross-lingual comparison of lexiconshas revealed many complementary SCFs in VN,GN and ILS, mono- and cross-lingual alignmentsof these lexicons at sense level would lead to amajor increase in SCF coverage.
Moreover, thecross-lingually uniform representation of SCFscan be exploited for an additional alignment ofthe lexicons at the level of SCF arguments.
Sucha fine-grained alignment of SCFs can be used, forinstance, to project VN semantic roles to GN, thusyielding a German resource for semantic role la-beling (see Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), Swier andStevenson (2005)).Subcat-LMF could be used for standardizingfurther English and German lexicons.
The auto-matic conversion of lexicons to Subcat-LMF re-quires the manual definition of a mapping, at leastfor syntactic arguments.
Furthermore, the auto-matic merging approach by Padro?
et al(2011)could be tested for English: given our standard-ized version of VN, other English SCF lexiconscould be merged fully automatically with theSubcat-LMF version of VN.5 ConclusionSubcat-LMF contributes to fostering the standard-ization of language resources and their interop-erability at the lexical-syntactic level across En-glish and German.
