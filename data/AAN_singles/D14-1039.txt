?Department of Linguistics, University of Texas at Austinben@benwing.com, jbaldrid@utexas.eduAbstractText-based document geolocation is com-monly rooted in language-based infor-mation retrieval techniques over geodesicgrids.
These methods ignore the naturalhierarchy of cells in such grids and fallafoul of independence assumptions.
Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of using lo-gistic regression models on a hierarchy ofnodes in the grid, which improves uponthe state of the art accuracy by severalpercent and reduces mean error distancesby hundreds of kilometers on data fromTwitter, Wikipedia, and Flickr.
We alsoshow that logistic regression performs fea-ture selection effectively, assigning highweights to geocentric terms.1 IntroductionDocument geolocation is the identification of thelocation?a specific latitude and longitude?thatforms the primary focus of a given document.
Thisassumes that a document can be adequately associ-ated with a single location, which is only valid forcertain documents, generally of fairly small size.Nonetheless, there are many natural situations inwhich such collections arise.
For example, a greatnumber of articles in Wikipedia have been man-ually geotagged; this allows those articles to ap-pear in their geographic locations in geobrowserslike Google Earth.
Images in social networks suchas Flickr may be geotagged by a camera and theirtextual tags can be treated as documents.
Like-wise, tweets in Twitter are often geotagged; in thiscase, it is possible to view either an individualtweet or the collection of tweets for a given useras a document, respectively identifying the loca-tion as the place from which the tweet was sent orthe home location of the user.Early work on document geolocation usedheuristic algorithms, predicting locations based ontoponyms in the text (named locations, determinedwith the aid of a gazetteer) (Ding et al., 2000;Smith and Crane, 2001).
More recently, vari-ous researchers have used topic models for doc-ument geolocation (Ahmed et al., 2013; Hong etal., 2012; Eisenstein et al., 2011; Eisenstein etal., 2010) or other types of geographic documentsummarization (Mehrotra et al., 2013; Adams andJanowicz, 2012; Hao et al., 2010).
A number ofresearchers have used metadata of various sortsfor document or user geolocation, including doc-ument links and social network connections.
Thisresearch has sometimes been applied to Wikipedia(Overell, 2009) or Facebook (Backstrom et al.,2010) but more commonly to Twitter, focusingvariously on friends and followers (McGee et al.,2013; Sadilek et al., 2012), time zone (Mahmud etal., 2012), declared location (Hecht et al., 2011),or a combination of these (Schulz et al., 2013).We tackle document geolocation using super-vised methods based on the textual content ofdocuments, ignoring their metadata.
Metadata-based approaches can achieve great accuracy (e.g.Schulz et al.
(2013) obtain 79% accuracy within100 miles for a US-based Twitter corpus, com-pared with 49% using our methods on a compa-rable corpus), but are very specific to the partic-ular corpus and the types of metadata it makesavailable.
For Twitter, the metadata includes theuser?s declared location and time zone, infor-mation which greatly simplifies geolocation andwhich is unavailable for other types of corpora,such as Wikipedia.
In many cases essentially nometadata is available at all, as in historical corporain the digital humanities (Lunenfeld et al., 2012),such as those in the Perseus project (Crane, 2012).Text-based approaches can be applied to all typesof corpora; metadata can be additionally incorpo-rated when available (Han and Cook, 2013).We introduce a hierarchical discriminative clas-sification method for text-based geotagging.
We336apply this to corpora in three languages (English,German and Portuguese).
This method scaleswell to large training sets and greatly improvesresults across a wide variety of corpora, beat-ing current state-of-the-art results by wide mar-gins, including Twitter users (Han et al., 2014,henceforth Han14; Roller et al., 2012, henceforthRoller12); Wikipedia articles (Roller12; Wing andBaldridge, 2011, henceforth WB11); and Flickrimages (O?Hare and Murdock, 2013, henceforthOM13).
Importantly, this is the first method thatimproves upon straight uniform-grid Naive Bayeson all of these corpora, in contrast with k-d trees(Roller12) and the current state-of-the-art tech-nique for Twitter users of geographically-salientfeature selection (Han14).We also show, contrary to Han14, that logisticregression when properly optimized is more ac-curate than state-of-the-art techniques, includingfeature selection, and fast enough to run on largecorpora.
Logistic regression itself very effectivelypicks out words with high geographic significance.In addition, because logistic regression does notassume feature independence, complex and over-lapping features of various sorts can be employed.2 DataWe work with six large datasets: two of geotaggedtweets, three of Wikipedia articles, and one ofFlickr photos.
One of the two Twitter datasets isprimarily localized to the United States, while theremaining datasets cover the whole world.TWUS is a dataset of tweets compiled byRoller12.
A document in this dataset is the con-catenation of all tweets by a single user, as longas at least one of the user?s tweets is geotaggedwith specific, GPS-assigned latitude/longitude co-ordinates.
The earliest such tweet determines theuser?s location.
Tweets outside of a bounding boxcovering the contiguous United States (includingparts of Canada and Mexico) were discarded, aswell as users that may be spammers or robots(based on the number of followers, followees andtweets).
The resulting dataset contains 38M tweetsfrom 450K users, of which 10,000 each are re-served for the development and test sets.TWWORLD is a dataset of tweets compiled byHan et al.
(2012).
It was collected in a simi-lar fashion to TWUS but differs in that it coversthe entire Earth instead of primarily the UnitedStates, and consists only of geotagged tweets.Non-English tweets and those not near a city wereremoved, and non-alphabetic, overly short andoverly infrequent words were filtered.
The result-ing dataset consists of 1.4M users, with 10,000each reserved for the development and test sets.ENWIKI13 is a dataset consisting of the 864Kgeotagged articles (out of 14M articles in all) inthe November 4, 2013 English Wikipedia dump.It is comparable to the dataset used in WB11 andwas processed using an analogous fashion.
Thearticles were randomly split 80/10/10 into training,development and test sets.DEWIKI14 is a similar dataset consisting of the324K geotagged articles (out of 1.71M articles inall) in the July 5, 2014 German Wikipedia dump.PTWIKI14 is a similar dataset consisting of the131K geotagged articles (out of 817K articles inall) in the June 24, 2014 Portuguese Wikipediadump.COPHIR (Bolettieri et al., 2009) is a largedataset of images from the photo-sharing socialnetwork Flickr.
It consists of 106M images, ofwhich 8.7M are geotagged.
Most images containuser-provided tags describing them.
We follow al-gorithms described in OM13 in order to make di-rect comparison possible.
This involves removingphotos with empty tag sets and performing bulkupload filtering, retaining only one of a set of pho-tos from a given user with identical tag sets.
Theresulting reduced set of 2.8M images is then di-vided 80/10/10 into training, development and testsets.
The tag set of each photo is concatenated intoa single piece of text (in the process losing user-supplied tag boundary information in the case ofmulti-word tags).Our code and processed corpora are availablefor download.13 Supervised models for documentgeolocationThe dominant approach for text-based geolocationcomes from language modeling approaches in in-formation retrieval (Ponte and Croft, 1998; Man-ning et al., 2008).
For this general strategy, theEarth is sub-divided into a grid, and then eachtraining set document is associated with the cellthat contains it.
Some model (typically NaiveBayes) is then used to characterize each cell and1https://github.com/utcompling/textgrounder/wiki/WingBaldridge_EMNLP2014337enable new documents to be assigned a latitudeand longitude based on those characterizations.There are several options for constructing the gridand for modeling, which we review next.3.1 Geodesic gridsThe simplest grid is a uniform rectangular onewith cells of equal-sized degrees, which was usedby Serdyukov et al.
(2009) for Flickr images andWB11 for Twitter and Wikipedia.
This has twoproblems.
Compared to a grid that takes documentdensity into account, it over-represents rural areasat the expense of urban areas.
Furthermore, therectangles are not equal-area, but shrink in widthaway from the equator (although the shrinkage ismild until near the poles).
Roller12 tackle the for-mer issue by using an adaptive grid based on k-dtrees, while Dias et al.
(2012) handle the latter is-sue with an equal-area quaternary triangular mesh.An additional issue with geodesic grids is thata single metro area may be divided between twoor more cells.
This can introduce a statisticalbias known as the modifiable areal unit problem(Gehlke and Biehl, 1934; Openshaw, 1983).
Oneway to mitigate this, implemented in Roller12?scode but not investigated in their paper, is to di-vide a cell in a k-d tree in such a way as to pro-duce the maximum margin between the dividingline and the nearest document on each side.A more direct method is to use a city-based rep-resentation, either with a full set of sufficiently-sized cities covering the Earth and taken froma comprehensive gazetteer (Han14) or a limited,pre-specified set of cities (Kinsella et al., 2011;Sadilek et al., 2012).
Han14 amalgamate citiesinto nearby larger cities within the same state (orequivalent); an even more direct method woulduse census-tract boundaries when available.
Dis-advantages of these methods are the dependencyon time-specific population data, making them un-suitable for some corpora (e.g.
19th-century doc-uments); the difficulty in adjusting grid resolutionin a principled fashion; and the fact that not alldocuments are near a city (Han14 find that 8% oftweets are ?rural?
and cannot predicted by theirmodel).We construct rectangular grids, since they arevery easy to implement and Dias et al.
(2012)?striangular mesh did not yield consistently betterresults over Wikipedia.
We use both uniform gridsand k-d tree grids with midpoint splitting.3.2 Naive BayesA geodesic grid of sufficient granularity creates alarge decision space, when each cell is viewed asa label to be predicted by some classifier.
Thissituation naturally lends itself to simple, scalablelanguage-modeling approaches.
For this generalstrategy, each cell is characterized by a pseudo-document constructed from the training docu-ments that it contains.
A test document?s locationis then chosen based on the cell with the most sim-ilar language model according to standard mea-sures such as Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence(Zhai and Lafferty, 2001), which seeks the cellwhose language model is closest to the test doc-ument?s, or Naive Bayes (Lewis, 1998), whichchooses the cell that assigns the highest probabil-ity to the test document.Han14, Roller12 and WB11 follow this strat-egy, using KL divergence in preference to NaiveBayes.
However, we find that Naive Bayes in con-junction with Dirichlet smoothing (Smucker andAllan, 2006) works at least as well when appropri-ately tuned.
Dirichlet smoothing is a type of dis-counting model that interpolates between the un-smoothed (maximum-likelihood) document distri-bution?
?diof a document diand the unsmootheddistribution?
?Dover all documents.
A generalinterpolation model for the smoothed distribution?dihas the following form:P (w|?di) = (1?
?di)P (w|?
?di) + ?diP (w|?
?D) (1)where the discount factor ?diindicates how muchprobability mass to reserve for unseen words.
ForDirichlet smoothing, ?diis set as:?di= 1?|di||di|+m(2)where |di| is the size of the document and m isa tunable parameter.
This has the effect of re-lying more on di?s distribution and less on theglobal distribution for larger documents that pro-vide more evidence than shorter ones.
NaiveBayes models are estimated easily, which allowsthem to handle fine-scale grid resolutions with po-tentially thousands or even hundreds of thousandsof non-empty cells to choose among.Figure 1 shows a choropleth map of the behav-ior of Naive Bayes, plotting the rank of cells for338Figure 1: Relative Naive Bayes rank of cells forENWIKI13 test document Pennsylvania Avenue(Washington, DC), surrounding the true location.the test document Pennsylvania Avenue (Washing-ton, DC) in ENWIKI13, for a uniform 0.1?grid.The top-ranked cell is the correct one.3.3 Logistic regressionThe use of discrete cells over the Earth?s sur-face allows any classification strategy to be em-ployed, including discriminative classifiers such aslogistic regression.
Logistic regression often pro-duces produces better results than generative clas-sifiers at the cost of more time-consuming train-ing, which limits the size of the problems it maybe applied to.
Training is generally unable to scaleto encompass several thousand or more distinct la-bels, as is the case with fine-scale grids of the sortwe may employ.
Nonetheless we find flat logis-tic regression to be effective on most of our large-scale corpora, and the hierarchical classificationstrategy discussed in ?4 allows us to take advan-tage of logistic regression without incurring sucha high training cost.3.4 Feature selectionNaive Bayes assumes that features are indepen-dent, which penalizes models that must accom-modate many features that are poor indicators andwhich can gang up on the good features.
Largeimprovements have been obtained by reducingthe set of words used as features to those thatare geographically salient.
Cheng et al.
(2010;2013) model word locality using a unimodal dis-tribution taken from Backstrom et al.
(2008) andtrain a classifier to identify geographically lo-cal words based on this distribution.
This un-fortunately requires a large hand-annotated cor-pus for training.
Han14 systematically investi-gate various feature selection methods for find-ing geo-indicative words, such as information gainratio (IGR) (Quinlan, 1993), Ripley?s K statis-tic (O?Sullivan and Unwin, 2010) and geographicdensity (Chang et al., 2012), showing significantimprovements on TWUS and TWWORLD (?2).For comparison with Han14, we test againstan additional baseline: Naive Bayes combinedwith feature selection done using IGR.
FollowingHan14, we first eliminate words which occur lessthan 10 times, have non-alphabetic characters inthem or are shorter than 3 characters.
We thencompute the IGR for the remaining words acrossall cells at a given cell size or bucket size, selectthe top N% for some cutoff percentage N (whichwe vary in increments of 2%), and then run NaiveBayes at the same cell size or bucket size.4 Hierarchical classificationTo overcome the limitations of discriminative clas-sifiers in terms of the maximum number of cellsthey can handle, we introduce hierarchical classifi-cation (Silla Jr. and Freitas, 2011) for geolocation.Dias et al.
(2012) use a simple two-level genera-tive hierarchical approach using Naive Bayes, butto our knowledge no previous work implements amulti-level discriminative hierarchical model withbeam search for geolocation.To construct the hierarchy, we start with a rootcell crootthat spans the entire Earth and from therebuild a tree of cells at different scales, from coarseto fine.
A cell at a given level is subdivided tocreate smaller cells at the next level of resolutionthat altogether cover the same area as their parent.We use the local classifier per parent approachto hierarchical classification (Silla Jr. and Fre-itas, 2011) in which an independent classifier islearned for every node of the hierarchy above theleaf nodes.
The probability of any node in the hi-erarchy is the product of the probabilities of thatnode and all of its ancestors, up to the root.
Thisis defined recursively as:P (croot) = 1.0P (cj) = P (cj|?cj)P (?cj)(3)where ?cjindicates cj?s parent in the hierarchy.In addition to allowing one to use many classi-fiers that each have a manageable number of out-comes, the hierarchical approach naturally lendsitself to beam search.
Rather than computing the339probability of every leaf cell using equation 3, weuse a stratified beam search: starting at the rootcell, keep the b highest-probability cells at eachlevel until reaching the leaf node level.
With atight beam?which we show to be very effective?this dramatically reduces the number of modelevaluations that must be performed at test time.Grid size parameters Two factors determinethe size of the grids at each level.
The first-levelgrid is constructed the same as for Naive Bayesor flat logistic regression and is controlled by itsown parameter.
In addition, the subdivision factorN determines how we subdivide each cell to getfrom one level to the next.
Both factors must beoptimized appropriately.For the uniform grid, we subdivide each cellintoNxN subcells.
In practice, there may actuallybe fewer subcells, because some of the potentialsubcells may be empty (contain no documents).For the k-d grid, if level 1 is created using abucket size B (i.e.
we recursively divide cells aslong as their size exceeds B), then level 2 is cre-ated by continuing to recursively divide cells thatexceed a smaller bucket size B/N .
At this point,the subcells of a given level-1 cell are the leaf cellscontained with the cell?s geographic area.
Theconstruction of level 3 proceeds similarly usingbucket size B/N2, etc.Note that the subdivision factor has a differentmeaning for uniform and k-d tree grids.
Further-more, because creating the subdividing cells for agiven cell involves dividing by N2for the uniformgrid but N for the k-d tree grid, greater subdivi-sion factors are generally required for the k-d treegrid to achieve similar-scale resolution.Figure 2 shows the behavior of hierarchical LRusing k-d trees for the test document Pennsylva-nia Avenue (Washington, DC) in ENWIKI13.
Af-ter ranking the first level, the beam zooms in onthe top-ranked cells and constructs a finer k-d treeunder each one (one such subtree is shown in thetop-right map callout).5 Experimental SetupConfigurations.
We experiment with severalmethods for configuring the grid and selecting thebest cell.
For grids, we use either a uniform ork-d tree grid.
For uniform grids, the main tunableparameter is grid size (in degrees), while for k-dtrees it is bucket size (BK), i.e.
the number of doc-uments above which a node is divided in two.Figure 2: Relative hierarchical LR rank of cellsfor ENWIKI13 test document Pennsylvania Av-enue (Washington, DC), surrounding the true lo-cation.
The first callout simply expands a portionof level 1, while the second callout shows a level1 cell subdivided down to level 2.For cell choice, the options are:?
NB: Naive Bayes baseline?
IGR: Naive Bayes using features selected byinformation gain ratio?
FlatLR: logistic regression model over allleaf nodes?
HierLR: product of logistic regression mod-els at each node in a hierarchical grid (eq.
3)For Dirichlet smoothing in conjunction with NaiveBayes, we set the Dirichlet parameter m =1, 000, 000, which we found worked well in pre-liminary experiments.
For hierarchical classifica-tion, there are additional parameters: subdivisionfactor (SF) and beam size (BM) (?4), and hierar-chy depth (D) (?6.4).
All of our test-set results usea depth of three levels.Due to its speed and flexibility, we use VowpalWabbit (Agarwal et al., 2014) for logistic regres-sion, estimating parameters with limited-memoryBFGS (Nocedal, 1980; Byrd et al., 1995).
Unlessotherwise mentioned, we use 26-bit feature hash-ing (Weinberger et al., 2009) and 40 passes overthe data (optimized based on early experiments ondevelopment data) and turn off the hold-out mech-anism.
For the subcell classifiers in hierarchicalclassification, which have fewer classes and muchless data, we use 24-bit features and 12 passes.Evaluation.
To measure geolocation perfor-mance, we use three standard metrics based on er-ror distance, i.e.
the distance between the correctlocation and the predicted location.
These metricsare mean and median error distance (Eisenstein et340al., 2010) and accuracy at 161 km (acc@161), i.e.within a 161-km radius, which was introduced byCheng et al.
(2010) as a proxy for accuracy withina metro area.
All of these metrics are indepen-dent of cell size, unlike the measure of cell accu-racy (fraction of cells correctly predicted) used inSerdyukov et al.
(2009).
Following Han14, we useacc@161 on development sets when choosing al-gorithmic parameter values such as cell and bucketsizes.6 Results6.1 TwitterWe show the effect of varying cell size in Table 1and k-d tree bucket size in Figure 3.
The numberof non-empty cells is shown for each cell size andbucket size.
For NB, this is the number of cellsagainst which a comparison must be made for eachtest document; for FlatLR, this is the number ofclasses that must be distinguished.
For HierLR, nofigure is given because it varies from level to leveland from classifier to classifier.
For example, witha uniform grid and subdivision factor of 3, eachlevel-2 subclassifier will have between 1 and 9 la-bels to choose among, depending on which cellsare empty.MethodCell Size #Class Acc.

This agreesin general with Han14?s findings.
We can onlycompare our figures directly with Han14 for k-dtrees?in this case they use a version of the samesoftware we use and report figures within 1% ofours for TWUS.
Their remaining results are com-puted using a city-based grid and an NB imple-mentation with add-one smoothing, and are signif-icantly worse than our uniform-grid NB and IGRfigures using Dirichlet smoothing, which is knownto significantly outperform add-one smoothing(Smucker and Allan, 2006).
For example, for NBthey report 30.8% acc@161 for TWUS and 20.0%for TWWORLD, compared with our 36.2% and30.2% respectively.
We suspect an additional rea-son for the discrepancy is due to the limitations oftheir city-based grid, which has no tunable param-eter to optimize the grid size and requires that testinstances not near a city be reported as incorrect.Our NB figures also beat the KL divergence fig-ures reported in Roller12 for TWUS (which theyterm UTGEO2011), perhaps again due to the dif-3Note that for TWWORLD, it was necessary to modifythe parameters normally passed to Vowpal Wabbit, movingup to 27-bit features and 96 passes, and 24-bit features with24 passes in sublevels of HierLR.341Corpus TWUS TWWORLDMethod Parameters A@161 Mean Med.

ENWIKI13 especially has densecoverage across the entire world, whereas TWUSonly covers the United States and parts of Canadaand Mexico.
Thus, there are a much larger num-ber of non-empty cells at a given resolution andmuch coarser resolution required, especially withthe uniform grid.
For example, at 7.5?there are933 non-empty cells, comparable to 1?for TWUS.Table 4 shows the number of classes and runtimefor FlatLR and HierLR at different parameter val-ues.
The hierarchical classification approach isclearly essential for allowing us to scale the dis-criminative approach for a large, dense datasetacross the whole world.Moving from larger to smaller Wikipedias,FlatLR becomes more competitive.
In particular,FlatLR outperforms NB and is close to HierLR forPTWIKI14, the smallest of the three (and signifi-cantly smaller than TWUS).
In this case, the rel-atively small size of the dataset and its greater ge-ographic specificity (many articles are located inBrazil or Portugal) allows for a fine enough reso-lution to make FlatLR perform well?comparableto or even finer than NB.In all of the Wikipedias, NB k-d outperforms342Corpus ENWIKI13 COPHIRMethod Parameters A@161 Mean Med.

It?sunclear what causes these variations, although it?sworth noting that Roller12?s NB k-d figures on anolder English Wikipedia corpus were are notice-ably higher than our figures: They report 90.3%acc@161, compared with our 84.5%.
We verifiedthat this is due to corpus differences: we obtaintheir performance when we run on their Wikipediacorpus.
This suggests that the various differencesmay be due to vagaries of the individual corpora,e.g.
the presence of differing numbers of geo-tagged stub articles, which are very short and thushard to geolocate.As for IGR, though it is competitive for Twitter,it performs badly here?in fact, it is even worsethan plain Naive Bayes for all three Wikipedias(likewise for COPHIR, in the next section).6.3 CoPhIRTable 3 shows results on the test set of COPHIRfor various methods, similarly to the ENWIKI13results.
HierLR is again the clear winner.
Unlikefor ENWIKI13, FlatLR is able to do fairly well.IGR performs poorly, especially when combinedwith k-d.In general, as can be seen, for COPHIR themedian figures are very low but the mean figuresvery high, meaning there are many images that canbe very accurately placed while the remainder arevery difficult to place.
(The former images likelyhave the location mentioned in the tags, while thelatter do not.
)For COPHIR, and also TWWORLD, HierLRperforms best when the root level is significantlycoarser than the cell or bucket size that is best forFlatLR.
The best setting for the root level appearsto be correlated with cell accuracy, which in gen-eral increases with larger cell sizes.
The intuitionhere is that HierLR works by drilling down froma single top-level child of the root cell.
Thus, thehigher the cell accuracy, the greater the fractionof test instances that can be improved in this fash-ion, and in general the better the ultimate valuesof the main metrics.
(The above discussion isn?tstrictly true for beam sizes above 1, but these tendto produce marginal improvements, with little ifany gain from going above a beam size of 5.)
Thelarge size of a coarse root-child cell, and corre-spondingly poor results for acc@161, can be off-set by a high subdivision factor, which does notmaterially slow down the training process.Our NB results are not directly comparable withOM13?s results on COPHIR because they use var-ious cell-based accuracy metrics while we usecell-size-independent metrics.
The closest to ouracc@161 metric is their Ac1 metric, which at acell size of 100 km corresponds to a 300km-per-side square at the equator, roughly comparable toour 161-km-radius circle.
They report Ac1 figuresof 57.7% for term frequency and 65.3% for userfrequency, which counts the number of distinctusers in a cell using a given term and is intended tooffset bias resulting from users who upload a largebatch of similar photos at a given location.
Ourterm frequency figure of 65.0% significantly beatstheirs, but we found that user frequency actuallydegraded our dev set results by 5%.
The reasonfor this discrepancy is unclear.6.4 Parameterization variationsOptimizing for median.
Note that better valuesfor the other metrics, especially median, can beachieved by specifically optimizing for these met-rics.
In general, the best parameters for medianare finer-scale than those for acc@161: smallergrid sizes and bucket sizes, and greater subdivisionfactors.
This is especially revealing in ENWIKI13and COPHIR.

Similarly, for the COPHIR devset, the optimized uniform 2-level HierLR medianerror of 46.6 km can be reduced to just 8.1 kmby dropping from 7?to 3.5?and bumping up thesubdivision factor from 4 to 35?again, causing adrop in acc@161 from 68.6% to 65.5%.Hierarchy depth.
We use a 3-level hierarchythroughout for the test set results.
Evaluation ondevelopment data showed that 2-level hierarchiesperform comparably for several data sets, but areless effective overall.
We did not find improve-ments from using more than three levels.
Whenusing a simple local classifier per parent approachas we do, which chains together spines of relatedbut independently trained classifiers when assign-ing a probability to a leaf cell, most of the ben-efit presumably comes from simply enabling lo-gistic regression to be used with fine-grained leafcells, overcoming the limitations of FlatLR.
Fur-ther benefits of the hierarchical approach might beachieved with the data-biasing and bottom-up er-ror propagation techniques of Bennett and Nguyen(2009) or the hierarchical Bayesian approach ofGopal et al.
(2012), which is able to handle large-scale corpora and thousands of classes.6.5 Feature SelectionThe main focus of Han14 is identifying geograph-ically salient words through feature selection.
Lo-gistic regression performs feature selection natu-rally by assigning higher weights to features thatbetter discriminate among the target classes.Table 6 shows the top 20 features ranked by fea-ture weight for a number of different cells, labeledby the largest city in the cell.
The features wereproduced using a uniform 5?grid, trained using27-bit features and 40 passes over TWUS.
Thehigh number of bits per feature were chosen to en-sure as few collisions as possible of different fea-tures (as it would be impossible to distinguish twowords that were hashed together).Most words are clearly region specific, con-sisting of cities, states and abbreviations, sportsteams (broncos, texans, niners, saints), well-known streets (bourbon, folsom), characteristicfeatures (desert, bayou, earthquake, temple), localbrands (whataburger, soopers, heb), local foods(gumbo, poutine), and dialect terms (hella, buku).Top-IGR words Bottom-IGR wordslockerby presswiches plan timeskilldeer haubrich party endfordville yabbo men twitterazilda presswich happy fullahauah pozuelo show parthutmacher akeley top forgetcere chewelah extra closemiramichi computacionales late deadalamosa bevilacqua facebook coolmultiservicios presswiche friday enjoyghibran curtisinn black truebriaroaks guymon dream foundjoekins dakotamart hey drinknumerica missoula face paybemidji mimbres finally meetamn shingobee easy lostroug gottsch time findpbtisd uprr live touchmarcenado hesperus wow birthdaybanerjee racingmason yesterday agoTable 7: Top and bottom 40 features selected usingIGR for TWUS with a uniform 1.5?grid.As a comparison, Table 7 shows the top and bot-tom 40 features selected using IGR on the samecorpus.

To some extent thisis a feature of IGR, since it divides by the binaryentropy of each word, which is directly relatedto its frequency.
However, it shows why cutoffsaround 90% of the original feature set are neces-sary to achieve good performance on the Twittercorpora.
(IGR does not perform well on Wikipediaor COPHIR, as shown above.
)7 ConclusionThis paper demonstrates that major performanceimprovements to geolocation based only on textcan be obtained by using a hierarchy of logisticregression classifiers.
Logistic regression also al-lows for the use of complex, interdependent fea-tures, beyond the simple unigram models com-monly employed.
Our preliminary experimentsdid not show noticeable improvements from bi-gram or character-based features, but it is pos-sible that higher-level features such as morpho-logical, part-of-speech or syntactic features couldyield further performance gains.
And, of course,these improved text-based models may help de-crease error even further when metadata (e.g.
timezone and declared location) are available.An interesting extension of this work is to relyupon the natural clustering of related documents.Joint modeling of geographic topics and loca-tions has been attempted (see ?1), but has gener-ally been applied to much smaller corpora thanthose considered here.
Skiles (2012) found sig-nificant improvements by clustering the trainingdocuments of large-scale corpora using K-means,training separate models from each cluster, and es-timating a test document?s location with the clus-ter model returning the best overall similarity (e.g.through KL divergence).
Bergsma et al.
(2013)likewise cluster tweets using K-means but predictlocation only at the country level.
Such methodscould be combined with hierarchical classificationto yield further gains.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Grant Delozier for as-sistance in generating choropleth graphs, and thethree anonymous reviewers for their feedback.This research was supported by a grant from theMorris Memorial Trust Fund of the New YorkCommunity Trust.ReferencesBenjamin Adams and Krzysztof Janowicz.
