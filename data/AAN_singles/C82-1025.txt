Academi~ 1982ON A DEVICE IN DICTIONARY OPERATIONS IN MACHINE TRANSLATIONZden~k KirschnerDepartment of Applied MathematicsFaculty of Mathematics and PhysicsCharles UniversityPragueCzechoslovakiaA special programme converting classes of wordsof international usage directly from English toCzech is described in its application in an ex-periment of machine translation as well as ingeneral environments.
The words undergo specialmorphemic analysis, they are adapted morphemic-ally and orthographical ly to the target langu-age form and,in the experimental version, theyare assigned pertinent grammatical and semanticinformation.Dictionary operations in automatic processing of natural lang-uage involve, as a rule, a number of problems, most of which beingconnected with the fact that lexicons general ly tend to grow beyondtolerable measure.
That is also why the ideal but hardly feasibleprinciple of l isting in the lexicon only "irregularities" has re-tained its methodological  appeal, especially in the automatic analys-is of natural language.
Various solutions may be found to the prob-lem of reducing the size of dictionaries; the one pre~ent~l here maybe of some interest, because the algorithm described performs thetask of substituting classes of target language equivalents forclasses of source language expressions.Replacing the source language words by target language equiv-alents must be regarded as an operation involving changes "irregular"if not by nature with some pairs of languages, then certainly inpoint of fact in actual practice everywhere.
Most languages that haveor are supposed to have had a common ancestor dlffer at the lexicallevel to such an extent that it is impossible to cover the etymolog-ical changes by any applicable set of rules, and even if this werepossible, semantic shift would interfere in an incontrollable way.However, the impact of some relatively recent historical changes(economic, political and cultural)has led to a specific and partialrapprochement of languages: the assimilation of words of foreignorigin caused by these processes usually happens in conformity withstandard morphemic and orthographic rules and, since most of the newacquisit ions stay beyond the reach of common usage, semantic shiftis rare.On this basis the so-called "translational" or "transducing"dictionary (henceforth TD) has been developed in the experimentswith machine translation carried out in the l inguistic group at thefaculty of mathematics and physics, Charles University, Prague.
This157158 Z. KIRSCHNERdevice converts the words of international usage from their sourcelanguage (English) form into the morphemical ly and orthographical lyadapted target language (Czech) counterparts in a three-step proced-ure, which involves also the modif ications in the corresponding der-ived parts-of-speech, i.e.
adjectives derived from nouns, adverbsfrom adjectives, etc.
In its present form, the TD covers the classesof English nouns ending in CE, CY, EGY, ENT, ER, ERE, GRAM, GRAPH,ICS, ID, ISM, ITY, IUM, ODE, OGY, ON, ONY, OPY, OR, ORY, PHONE, PHY,SCOPE, SIS, TRY, URE, adjectives in ABLE, IBLE, AL, ARY, IC, IVE,OUS, RSE, and verbs in ATE, FY, ZE, and it can be extended as requi-red.
Most of these classes fall into more subclasses to meet thespecific requirements based on grammatical, semantic, or, as the casemay be, orthographic distinctions.
The equivalent forms need notdiffer at all, as e.g.
in IMPEDANCE <but the adjective derived isIMPEDAN~Nf), or they differ very little <DIODE ~ DIODA, GRAPH =GRAF,etc.
), or differ considerably (OPTIMIZATION = OPTIMALIZACE, INTENS-IFIER = INTENZIFIKATOR, DEMONSTRATE = DEMONSTROVAT, ADAPTABLE =ADAPTOVATELN~).In the overall algorithm, the main dict ionary precedes the TD,so that all grammatical ly and/or semantical ly idiosyncratic wordsformally belonging to the classes enumerated above can evade thetreatment in TD: e.g.
ICE, ICY, WENT, SCOPE, or even APPLICATION (anoun with partial ly idiomatic properties taken over from the cor-responding verbal frame), etc.
The forms of words that passed throughthe main dictionary, failed to be identified, and were reconstructedagain, enter the first step of the TD procedure: a special morphemicanalysis concerning forms of unrecognized words that are potentialmembers of the classes covered by TD.
Thus, e.g., the normal formILLUSTRATE,<+ED) is reconstructed from the form ILLUSTRATED, STRATEGY(+S) from STRATEGIES (but not OPTIC (+S) from OPTICS, wherea restriction interferes).
Some words undergo special modif icat ionsin the first step, most ly to be adapted to more frequent usage or tomore profound changes in the target language (e.g., with both kindsof adaptations in one, MINIMISE becomes temporari ly MINIM-ALIZE;LOCALIZE, of course, remains unaffected).The second step selects the words to be treated and replacesthe source language suffixes or endings by the corresponding targetlanguage ones: as examples, three rules can be quoted, the first fornouns ending in ITY (permeability, viscosity, thermoelasticity, etc.
),the second for verbs in ATE (demonstrate, il lustrate, etc.
), and thethird for adjectives in SSIVE <aggressive, passive, massive, etc.
).The words enter this step desintegrated, as lists of ordered charact-ers.
In the following rules, a, b are variables for labels - indiv-idual Characters or strings of characters - u, v, w variables forlists - e.g., one or more characters, labels, etc.
; they can beempty lists, too.
Capital letters and digits constitute constants;the double sign ~ or ~ indicates that the following label is des-integrated and represents a list of characters.
The rest of charactersused convey grammatical, semantic and/or technical information.
Theconventional signs A ,  =, /, ~ , C have their usual meaning, viz.conjunction, equality, non-equality, set- intersection and set-inclus-ion, respectively; == means "rewrite as".ATOM (u,I,T,Y) == PN (u,I ,T,~(~93V2),~A,*PROP,/,~).ATOM (u,A,T,E) == PV (u,U,J ,*(21~2WW5UIX3), I(*A,*H,*C),2(*A,~C,~OB),/ ,? )
.ATOM (u ,a ,~b)  == PA (u ,a ,~SI2VNI2,~(Y) ,*A,~C,~MNR)/a~S \b~SIVE.The third step is closely connected with the second and per-forms the necessary orthographic adjustments.
E.g., the ruleON A DEVICE IN DICTIONARY OPERATIONS 159C0(u,?,a,b,v,#,w) == C~(u,a,?,v,#,w)/a=TAb=HVa:b. '
, ({b}{c,o,s}):~.applied recursively until v equals one single character or is empty,changes TH into T; any doubled character (with the exception of C,O,S)becomes single.
Very similar rules handle the groups PH, QU, etc.
;e.g., another ruleC~(u,~,a,b,v,~,w) == C~(u,E,b,~,v,~w)/a=C,N{b}c {A,L,O,R,T,U}.&pplied recursively in the same way changes C which immediately prec-edes A or L or O or R or T or U into K. There is a set of such rulesdealing with groups of two or, as the case may be, more characters;complementary rules control the movement of the ~ sign in case thefirst character, the second or the following ones do not correspondto the condition.
To quote the simplest example, the following rulemoves the ~ sign by one place only in case the first character(standing in the posit ion indicated by the variable a) is not T or Por Q or C, and the two characters tested are not equal:C@(u,~,a,b,v,~,w) == C~(u,a,~,b,v,#,w)/({a}n {T,P,Q,C})=~A a/b.The actual writ ing of rules is, of course, more economical, e.g.
theleft members are not repeated, etc.
Thus, original English words likeTHERMOELASTICITY, PHILOSOPHY, QUANTIFIER, ILLUSTRATE, MASSIVE becomeCzech stems TERMOELASTICIT, FILOSOFI, KVANTIFIKA2~OR,L~SI2VNI2 (notethat the digit 2 following a vowel denotes the diacrit ical mark "'"indicating length), respectively; first, of course, they are providedwith all necessary information, reintegrated and brought to the can-onical form required by the system.In our experimental system, the TD operates on a relativelynarrow, semantical ly circumscribed domain of scientific and technic-al sublanguage concerned with microelectronics: this makes it possib-le to keep the semantic description apparatus at an adequate and, atthe same time, suff iciently general level, a condit ion on which the"profitableness" of TD depends under circumstances described.
Theprogramme of TD written in Colmerauer's Q-systems (Q-language)consists of less than 90 instructions (rules with a relatively highdegree of recursion involved) and it is supposed to cover a set ofthousands of lexical items, most of which represent very frequentterms or term components.
In the described environments (experiment-ing with Engl ish-Czech machine translation, microelectronics) thedevice disclosed has proved extremely effective and there are reasonsto believe that it can serve its purpose in other conditions as well:e.g.
in application to other pairs or multiplets of languages, inother domains, and/or applied in a different, theoretical ly morescrupulous manner, it may give even better results.The latter observation deserves some comment.
So far, the appl-ication of transducing dictionary in the framework of our experimenthas benn considered.
However, this particular way of application mustnot be regarded as anything else than purely experimental testing ofthis device in partial ly simpified conditions; in fact, the resultsof such a testing have been reported on in the preceding paragraphs.In a full-f ledged system of natural language analysis and synthesis,the considerably more developed semantic apparatus would impose muchmore rigorous restrictions on the constitution of uniform, semantic-ally homogeneous, classes to be covered by TD, which might impair itseffectivity considerably.
The proper place of TD is at the morphemicor morphonemic level.
If the operation of TD is confined to thesedomains only (grammatical and semantic information being assigned inanother place), its use can be generalized, so that, in substance, allwords formally belonging to the classes defined purely on morphemicand orthographic grounds can be transduced by it.
Exceptions are rare;some of them can be solved in the framework of special morphemic de-160 Z. KIRSCHNERcompos i t ion  (as in the above example - ~IINI~IISE vs. LOCALISE>, somemust be handled by the d ic t ionar ies  that precede the app l icat ion  ofTD in the a lgor i thm - stat ist ics  must  decide what should be regardedas except ional  (e.g.
the ending -XIAL in Engl ish may give -XNf or-X IALNf  in Czech - EP ITAXIAL  vs. COAXIAL ; however, it should beobserved in this place that both vers ions - the genera l ly  acceptedone (EPITAXNf) and the other (EPITAXI~LNf)  would be undoubted ly  under-stood without  any d i f f i cu l ty  by the reader>.
In this connect ion,  itshould be pointed out, that, in such h ighly spec ia l i zed domains asmicroe lect ron ics  or computer  system programming,etc ,  the widely usedpract ice  of taking over and adapt ing foreign express ions  af fectsin a high degree regions t rad i t iona l ly  "protected" by normat ivegrammar ians  and patr iot ic  termino log is ts  (GETTER = "GETR", CHIP ="~IP", HOLD ="HOLDOVAT",  AEEND = "ABENDOVAT", PRI~TER = "PRINTR",etc.>; in our opinion,  this pract ice  is very often ful ly just i f iedand it should be rather coord inated than condemned,  since it makesprompt and correct  unders tand ing  between experts  possible,  and itundoubtab ly  conta ins  rat ional  and progress ive  tendenc ies  contr ibut ingto a new phase in the rapprochement  ment ioned above.
Nhether  a newor adapted TD l ike device may be found usefu l ' in  this domain, too,remains to be seen.
