I will present methods to generate high-coverage resources that capture such associations.I will show how these resources can be used foranalyzing emotions in text, detecting personalityfrom essays, and generating music from novels.Finally, I will show how word-sentiment associa-tion lexicons have helped create the top-rankingsystems in recent SemEval competitions on thesentiment analysis of social media posts.1
