Thetarget languages are those in which wordboundaries are ambiguous, such as Chineseand Japanese.
In the method, word-basedand character-based processing is combined,and word segmentation and POS tagging areconducted simultaneously.
Experimental re-sults on multiple corpora show that the inte-grated method has high accuracy.1 IntroductionPart-of-speech (POS) tagging is an important taskin natural language processing, and is often neces-sary for other processing such as syntactic parsing.English POS tagging can be handled as a sequentiallabeling problem, and has been extensively studied.However, in Chinese and Japanese, words are notseparated by spaces, and word boundaries must beidentified before or during POS tagging.
Therefore,POS tagging cannot be conducted without word seg-mentation, and how to combine these two processingis an important issue.
A large problem in word seg-mentation and POS tagging is the existence of un-known words.
Unknown words are defined as wordsthat are not in the system?s word dictionary.
It is dif-ficult to determine the word boundaries and the POStags of unknown words, and unknown words oftencause errors in these processing.In this paper, we study a hybrid method for Chi-nese and Japanese word segmentation and POS tag-ging, in which word-based and character-based pro-cessing is combined, and word segmentation andPOS tagging are conducted simultaneously.
In themethod, word-based processing is used to handleknown words, and character-based processing isused to handle unknown words.
Furthermore, infor-mation of word boundaries and POS tags are usedat the same time with this method.
The followingsections describe the hybrid method and results ofexperiments on Chinese and Japanese corpora.2 Hybrid Method for Word Segmentationand POS TaggingMany methods have been studied for Chinese andJapanese word segmentation, which include word-based methods and character-based methods.
Nak-agawa (2004) studied a method which combines aword-based method and a character-based method.Given an input sentence in the method, a lattice isconstructed first using a word dictionary, which con-sists of word-level nodes for all the known words inthe sentence.
These nodes have POS tags.
Then,character-level nodes for all the characters in thesentence are added into the lattice (Figure 1).
Thesenodes have position-of-character (POC) tags whichindicate word-internal positions of the characters(Xue, 2003).
There are four POC tags, B, I , Eand S, each of which respectively indicates the be-ginning of a word, the middle of a word, the endof a word, and a single character word.
In themethod, the word-level nodes are used to identifyknown words, and the character-level nodes are usedto identify unknown words, because generally word-level information is precise and appropriate for pro-cessing known words, and character-level informa-tion is robust and appropriate for processing un-known words.
Extended hidden Markov models areused to choose the best path among all the possiblecandidates in the lattice, and the correct path is indi-cated by the thick lines in Figure 1.
The POS tagsand the POC tags are treated equally in the method.Thus, the word-level nodes and the character-levelnodes are processed uniformly, and known wordsand unknown words are identified simultaneously.In the method, POS tags of known words as well asword boundaries are identified, but POS tags of un-known words are not identified.
Therefore, we ex-tend the method in order to conduct unknown wordPOS tagging too:Hybrid MethodThe method uses subdivided POC-tags in or-der to identify not only the positions of charac-ters but also the parts-of-speech of the compos-ing words (Figure 2, A).
In the method, POStagging of unknown words is conducted at thesame time as word segmentation and POS tag-217Figure 1: Word Segmentation and Known Word POS Tagging using Word and Character-based Processingging of known words, and information of parts-of-speech of unknown words can be used forword segmentation.There are also two other methods capable of con-ducting unknown word POS tagging (Ng and Low,2004):Word-based Post-Processing MethodThis method receives results of word segmen-tation and known word POS tagging, and pre-dicts POS tags of unknown words using wordsas units (Figure 2, B).
This approach is thesame as the approach widely used in EnglishPOS tagging.
In the method, the process ofunknown word POS tagging is separated fromword segmentation and known word POS tag-ging, and information of parts-of-speech of un-known words cannot be used for word segmen-tation.
In later experiments, maximum entropymodels were used deterministically to predictPOS tags of unknown words.
As features forpredicting the POS tag of an unknown word w,we used the preceding and the succeeding twowords of w and their POS tags, the prefixes andthe suffixes of up to two characters of w, thecharacter types contained in w, and the lengthof w.Character-based Post-Processing MethodThis method is similar to the word-based post-processing method, but in this method, POStags of unknown words are predicted usingcharacters as units (Figure 2, C).
In the method,POS tags of unknown words are predicted us-ing exactly the same probabilistic models asthe hybrid method, but word boundaries andPOS tags of known words are fixed in the post-processing step.Ng and Low (2004) studied Chinese word seg-mentation and POS tagging.
They compared sev-eral approaches, and showed that character-basedapproaches had higher accuracy than word-basedapproaches, and that conducting word segmentationand POS tagging all at once performed better thanconducting these processing separately.
Our hy-brid method is similar to their character-based all-at-once approach.
However, in their experiments, onlyword-based and character-based methods were ex-amined.
In our experiments, the combined methodof word-based and character-based processing wasexamined.
Furthermore, although their experimentswere conducted with only Chinese data, we con-ducted experiments with Chinese and Japanese data,and confirmed that the hybrid method performedwell on the Japanese data as well as the Chinesedata.3 ExperimentsWe used five word-segmented and POS-tagged cor-pora; the Penn Chinese Treebank corpus 2.0 (CTB),a part of the PFR corpus (PFR), the EDR cor-pus (EDR), the Kyoto University corpus version2 (KUC) and the RWCP corpus (RWC).
The firsttwo were Chinese (C) corpora, and the rest wereJapanese (J) corpora, and they were split into train-ing and test data.
The dictionary distributed withJUMAN version 3.61 (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998)was used as a word dictionary in the experimentswith the KUC corpus, and word dictionaries wereconstructed from all the words in the training data inthe experiments with other corpora.
Table 1 summa-rizes statistical information of the corpora: the lan-guage, the number of POS tags, the sizes of trainingand test data, and the splitting methods of them1.
Weused the following scoring measures to evaluate per-formance of word segmentation and POS tagging:R : Recall (The ratio of the number of correctlysegmented/POS-tagged words in system?s out-put to the number of words in test data),P : Precision (The ratio of the number of correctlysegmented/POS-tagged words in system?s out-put to the number of words in system?s output),1The unknown word rate for word segmentation is not equalto the unknown word rate for POS tagging in general, sincethe word forms of some words in the test data may exist in theword dictionary but the POS tags of them may not exist.
Suchwords are regarded as known words in word segmentation, butas unknown words in POS tagging.218Figure 2: Three Methods for Word Segmentation and POS TaggingF : F-measure (F = 2?R?

and Hy-brid Method respectively indicate results obtainedwith the word-based post-processing method, thecharacter-based post-processing method, and the hy-brid method.
Two types of performance were mea-sured: performance of word segmentation alone,and performance of both word segmentation andPOS tagging.
We first compare performance ofboth word segmentation and POS tagging.
TheF-measures of the hybrid method were highest onall the corpora.
This result agrees with the ob-servation by Ng and Low (2004) that higher accu-racy was obtained by conducting word segmenta-tion and POS tagging at the same time than by con-ducting these processing separately.
Comparing theword-based and the character-based post-processingmethods, the F-measures of the latter were higheron the Chinese corpora as reported by Ng andLow (2004), but the F-measures of the former wereslightly higher on the Japanese corpora.
The sametendency existed in the recalls for known words;the recalls of the character-based post-processingmethod were highest on the Chinese corpora, but2The recalls for known words of the word-based and thecharacter-based post-processing methods differ, though thePOS tags of known words are identified in the first commonstep.
This is because known words are sometimes identified asunknown words in the first step and their POS tags are predictedin the post-processing step.those of the word-based method were highest onthe Japanese corpora, except on the EDR corpus.Thus, the character-based method was not alwaysbetter than the word-based method as reported by Ngand Low (2004) when the methods were used withthe word and character-based combined approach onJapanese corpora.
We next compare performance ofword segmentation alone.
The F-measures of the hy-brid method were again highest in all the corpora,and the performance of word segmentation was im-proved by the integrated processing of word seg-mentation and POS tagging.
The precisions of thehybrid method were highest with statistical signifi-cance on four of the five corpora.
In all the corpora,the recalls for unknown words of the hybrid methodwere highest, but the recalls for known words werelowest.Comparing our results with previous work is noteasy since experimental settings are not the same.It was reported that the original combined methodof word-based and character-based processing hadhigh overall accuracy (F-measures) in Chinese wordsegmentation, compared with the state-of-the-artmethods (Nakagawa, 2004).
Kudo et al (2004) stud-ied Japanese word segmentation and POS taggingusing conditional random fields (CRFs) and rule-based unknown word processing.
They conductedexperiments with the KUC corpus, and achieved F-measure of 0.9896 in word segmentation, which isbetter than ours (0.9847).

Although, in our experiments, extended hid-den Markov models were used to find the best so-lution, the performance will be further improved byusing CRFs instead, which can easily incorporate awide variety of features.4 ConclusionIn this paper, we studied a hybrid method in whichword-based and character-based processing is com-bined, and word segmentation and POS tagging areconducted simultaneously.
We compared its perfor-mance of word segmentation and POS tagging withother methods in which POS tagging is conductedas a separated post-processing.
Experimental resultson multiple corpora showed that the hybrid methodhad high accuracy in Chinese and Japanese.ReferencesTaku Kudo, Kaoru Yamamoto, and Yuji Matsumoto.2004.
