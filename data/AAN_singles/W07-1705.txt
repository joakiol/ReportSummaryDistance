We select the most important informa-tion from diabetic patients?
records.
Mostdata being processed are free-form texts,only a part is in table form.
The work hasthree goals: to test classical IE methods ontexts in Polish, to create relational databasecontaining the extracted data, and to prepareannotated data for further IE experiments.1 IntroductionInformation extraction from natural language texthas become an important task for NLP applica-tions during the last years.
In the era of huge textdata collections, these methods allows us to per-form searches within reasonable time.
For the pur-pose of IE, many methods based on very differ-ent approaches (formal grammars, statistics, artifi-cial intelligence) have already been elaborated.
Inspite of a great number of described experiments,the invented methods were untested on Polish texts.Nowadays, there is great interest in statistical andmachine learning methods, e.g.
(Bunescu et al,2003), but applying machine learning techniques toPolish texts is difficult, as there are hardly any an-notated Polish data (excluding morpho-syntactic in-formation which is available).
The second obstaclewas the type of chosen data ?
relatively low num-ber of available records with complex text.
That iswhy we decided to carry out a rule-based IE sys-tem.1 Below, we present the system selecting infor-mation from diabetic patients?
hospital records writ-ten in unrestricted Polish.
We defined a domain de-pendent set of rules basing on an expert?s knowl-edge and tested them on the previously unseen re-ports.
The extracted data were put into a databaseallowing for statistical analysis.
The other result ofthe project, the annotated set of original reports, canbe further used for applying other methods of IE tothese texts.In our project, we use the SProUT (Shallow Pro-cessing with Unification and Typed Feature Struc-tures) system, (Droz?dz?yn?ski et al, 2004).
SProUTis a general purpose platform consisting of a set ofcomponents for basic linguistic operations.
Gram-mar rules are regular expressions on typed featurestructures (TFS) which are results of tokenizationor morphological analysis, as well as informationfrom the domain lexicon.
SProUT differs frommanyother systems in that it allows for unification of TFSsthus allows more general extraction rules.
AnalysingPolish text is possible due to the integration (Pisko-rski et al, 2004) of Morfeusz, a morphological anal-yser for Polish (Wolin?ski, 2006).Although most biomedical IE activities are relatedto literature mining and terminology extraction, (e.g.
(Bunescu et al, 2003), (Tveit and Saetre 2005)),clinical patients record mining is not a new researchgoal for all languages, e.g.
(Hahn, Romacker andSchulz, 2002).
In (Hripcsak et al, 2002) 24 clini-cal conditions were extracted from narrative chestsradiographic reports.
The task closest to the pre-1Our first rule-based IE experiment concerned mammogra-phy reports (Mykowiecka, Kups?c?
and Marciniak, 2004).35sented here, i.e.
searching for information containedin natural language patients?
discharge summarieswas undertaken in project MENELAS (Zweigen-baum, 1994) and AMBIT (Harkema et al, 2004).
Inthe last one, the extraction rules were based on bothsyntactic (word category) and semantic information(e.g.
latitude-noun or area-noun).
83 radiology re-ports were processed and descriptions of lung can-cers extracted and evaluated.
The exemplary resultsfor location were: 61% precision and 92% recall.Results of our experiment are shown in sections 4and 6.2 Domain descriptionFor the purpose of diabetic patients?
hospital docu-mentation analysis, we elaborated a domain modelfor the part of data which we are interested in.
Themodel has been defined on the basis of an expert?sknowledge and the data i.e.
hospital documents.
Themodel describes information on a patient, hospitali-sation, diagnosis, tests, treatment and complications.To formalize it, we used OWL-DL standard and theProt?g?
ontology editor.
A part of the diabetes on-tology is shown in Fig.
1.For the purpose of information extraction inSProUT, the ontology had to be translated (manu-ally) into a typed feature structures hierarchy.
In theextraction system, the domain model is representedby typed TFSs.
A feature?s (attribute?s) value can bean atomic type, another TFS, or a list of atomic typesor TFSs.
The type hierarchy contains 139 typeswith 65 attributes, but as much as 65 types representmedicine terms.An example of a structure defined to represent ba-sic information about a patient?s diabetes is given inFig.
2.
The structure is of the type diabet_desc_strand has five attributes.
A value of the D_TYPE at-tribute has the type of d_type_t which is a supertypefor three types of diabetes: first, second, other.
Thenext attribute HBA1C refers to the results of an im-portant diabetes monitoring test.
Its numerical valueis represented as a string.
Next two attributes areof boolean type and indicate if the illness is uncon-trolled and if the patient had incidences of hypogly-caemia.
A value of the last attribute DIAB_FROMis another TFS of type diab_from_str representingwhen the diabetes have been diagnosed.

?Figure 2: Structure of type diabet_desc_strEvery one document we process concerns one pa-tient?s visit in hospital.
A particular visit is identified(see Fig.
3) by two parameters: ID number withina year and a year (attribute ID_YEAR).

In such cases, there are addi-36tional hospital documents referring to these visitsdescribed by an attribute CONT: yes ?

?Figure 3: Visit?s identification structureThe specific structures are defined for represent-ing the following information:?
identification of a patient?s visit in hospital,dates when the hospitalisation took place, andits reasons,?
patient information: identification, age, sex,weight,?
data about diabetes (see Fig.
2),?
complications,?
other illnesses including autoimmunology andaccompanying illnesses, which may be corre-lated with diabetes, like hypertension,?
diabetes treatment: recognition of insulin typeand its doses and other oral medications,?
diet: how many calories, and how many mealsare recommended,?
patient?s education, observing of diet, modifi-cation of treatment or diet.In order to represent complications we definedthe appropriate hierarchy.
It contains three maintypes of complications: angiopathy, neuropathy anddiabetic foot.
The first two have subtypes.
An-giopathy divides into micro and macroangiopathy,and neuropathy can be autonomic neuropathy or pe-ripheral polineuropathy.
Micro and macroangiopatyhas further subtypes.
One common complication ?rethinopathy is a subtype of microangiopathy andhas additional attribute, that represents informationabout cooccurring maculopathy.
Rethinopathy hasalso subtypes.Sometimes it is convenient to recognise more thenone complication through one rule.
In this case, re-sults are represented in a list.
For example, the re-sult of recognition of the following phrase describ-ing complications z neuropatia?
autonomiczna?
i ob-wodowa?
?with autonomic and peripheral neuropa-thy?
is represented in Fig.
4.
These two complica-tions cannot be identified separately, as there is onlyone occurrence of the keyword neuropathy.???

?Figure 4: List of complications3 Information Extraction3.1 Domain dictionary ?
gazetteerA domain dictionary contains all forms of the termsimportant to the domain terminology.
These termscame from the data set or were introduced into thelexicon on the basis of a domain expert?s knowl-edge.
The lexicon contains among others all insulinand oral medication names important in diabetology,we introduced forms in nominative and genitive (ifsuch exist) ?
only these forms appeared in the doc-uments.
The other group of words in the dictionaryconsists of names of diseases and diabetic complica-tions.
They have been introduced into the lexicon inall forms used in the documents.In this specific domain lexicon, there are no in-formation about grammatical categories because itis not used within the grammar rules.
In the dictio-nary, we have only semantic information about en-tries.
There are two levels of semantic information:GTYPE ?
groups entries with a similar meaning,and G_CONCEPT connects an entry with its uniqueinterpretation.
The lexicon is rather small ?
justover 200 word forms.
In Fig.
5, there is a fragmentof the gazetteer with eight entries.
All of them referto different types of neuropathy complications.3.2 Grammar rulesA grammar in SProUT consists of rules, which areregular expressions over TFSs with functional oper-ators and coreferences, representing the recognition37neuropatia | GTYPE: gaz_comp | G_CONCEPT: neuropathy_tNeuropatia | GTYPE: gaz_comp | G_CONCEPT: neuropathy_tNeuropatia?

| GTYPE: gaz_neuro |G_CONCEPT: autonomic_neuropathyautonomiczna | GTYPE: gaz_neuro |G_CONCEPT: autonomic_neuropathyFigure 5: A fragment of gazetteerpattern.
Output structures are also TFSs.
Rules usethree sources of information: tokenization (struc-tures of type token for recognising, among others,abbreviations, dates, numbers), morphological anal-ysis (structures of type morph), and a domain dictio-nary (gazetteer).The SProUT grammar described in the paper con-sists of about 100 extraction rules.
Each rule detectswords or phrases describing information presentedin section 2.
For example, the rule in Fig.
6 recog-nises the identification number of a patient?s visit inhospital.
The first line recognises a word from mor-phological lexicon that has the base form (STEM)numer ?number?
or an abbreviation2 of this word, sothey are recognised as a token with an appropriateSURFACE form.
The next line: token?
omits adot after the abbreviation, if it is necessary.
Next twolines recognise the keywords with the base formsksie?ga (?book?, ?document?)
and g?
?wny (?main?
).Then, the identification number of the document isrecognised by the liczba_nat rule called (via the@seek operator).
The number is unified with thevalue of the ID attribute in the output structure.
Nexttwo lines are optional, they recognise a year num-ber after a slash or a backslash, if this informationis present.
If not, the year is fixed, during postpro-cessing, according to the dates of the patient?s visitin hospital.
In this particular case, the value of theattribute CONT is no in the output structure.
Therule in Fig.
6 captures, among other, the followingphrases:?
Numer ksie?gi g?

There is noneed to use any morphological features in rules, be-cause we do not have to precisely delimit phrases.Searched (key) phrases consist very often of wordswhich are very strongly connected with particularnotions.
For example, if we find a phrase stopycukrzycowej ?diabetic foot?, it is practically certainthat it concerns a complication.
Only base wordforms (values of STEM attribute) from the morpho-logical analyser output turned out to be necessaryhere.Fig.
7 contains a simple rule recognising autoim-munology diseases.
It seeks for any occurrence ofthe following pattern: <disease, autoimmunology-disease-specification>.
The first line of the rulerecognises a word: choroba or zesp??
e.g., ?disease?.The second line requires an entry from the domaindictionary which represents an autoimmunology dis-ease.
Its type (variable #type ) is unified with thevalue of the attribute AUTOIMM_DISEASE in theoutput structure.3.3 Difficult IssuesAlthough the results of the program are quite good,there are some difficult issues which cause errors.38We have to cope with negation, which some-times is difficult to determine.
In the followingphrase: bez obecnos?ci retinopatii ?without presenceof retinopathy?, it is not enough to identify the key-word retinopatii ?retinopathy?, it is necessary torecognise negation expressed in the form of the neg-ative preposition bez ?without?.
Here, the negationappeared just before the keyword, and it can be eas-ily noticed, but sometimes a negation is far froma keyword, and is difficult to process with shallowparsing methods.
Let us consider the following sen-tence: Nie stwierdzono p?z?nych powik?an?
cukrzycyo typie mikroangiopatii.
?there were no long-lastingdiabetes complications of microagiopathy type ?.
Inthis case, the negation nie stwierdzono ?there wereno?
is at the beginning of the sentence and the key-word mikroangiopatii ?microangiopathy?
is the lastword of the sentence.
The above phrase is recog-nised with the rule in Fig.
8.
It refers to the baseforms of certain words and to the domain lexicon inorder to identify a complication (variable #t).
Thesame rule recognise, among other, the followingphrases which meaning is the same as the previousone.?
nie wykryto obecnos?ci p?z?nych powik?an?cukrzycowych pod postacia?
mikroangiopatii,?
nie wyste?puja?
p?z?ne powik?ania cukrzycowe ocharakterze mikroangiopatii,?
Nie stwierdzono p?z?nych zmian cukrzycowychw postaci mikroangiopatii.In the very similar example: Nie stwierdzonop?z?nych powik?an?
cukrzycy z wyja?tkiem mikroan-giopatii.
?there were no long-lasting diabetes com-plications excluding microagiopathy?
the case is justthe opposite, and the microangiopathy should berecognised.
So, to properly identify whether a pa-tient has or hasn?t microangiopathy we have to anal-yse the whole sentence.Some problems are caused by keywords whichhave different interpretation depending on the con-text.
e.g., mikroalbuminuria refers to a complicationin the phrase wysta?pi?a mikroalbuminuria ?microal-buminuria appeared?
and denotes a test in the phraseMikroalbuminuria: 25 mg/dobe?
?Microalbuminuria:25 mg/day?.
In this case we determine the meaningof an ambiguous notion according to its context.brak_powiklan :>morph & [STEM ?nie?]

])gazetteer & [GTYPE gaz_comp, G_CONCEPT #t]->no_comp_str & [N_COMP #t].Figure 8: The rule recognising the lack of a specifiedcomplicationThe next thing that should be taken into account,is that sometimes several pieces of information haveto be recognised with one rule.
In the following co-ordinated phrase: retinopatie?
prosta?
oka lewego orazproliferacyjna oka prawego z makulopatia?
w obuoczach ?nonproliferative rethinopathy in the left eyeand proliferative (rethinopathy) in the right eye withmaculopathy in both eyes?
we have to recognise bothtypes of rethinopathy with maculopathy and createa list of complications as the output structure, seeFig.
9.
The rule almost entirely refers to notionsfrom the domain dictionary.
It identifies a combi-nation of notions denoting retinopathy.
The domaindictionary contains both Polish and Latin (words inthis case both languages are used by doctors) refer-ring to this complication.In order to recognise precisely given information,one tends to write complex rules describing entirephrases instead of separated terms.
The crucial prob-lem for the effectiveness of complex IE rules is thatPolish is a free word language.
This greatly in-creases the number of ways the same idea can beexpressed.
Let us consider the following examples:?
Wieloletnia, niekontrolowana cukrzyca typu 2,long-lasting uncontrolled diabetes type 2,?
Niekontrolowana, wieloletnia cukrzyca typu 2,?
Wieloletnia cukrzyca typu 2, niekontrolowana,?

Every word of these phrases carriesimportant information: wieloletni ?long-lasting?,niekontrolowany ?uncontrolled?, typ 2 ?type 2?.
Butthey should be identified as important only in con-text of the keyword cukrzyca ?diabetes?.
The onlysolution is to recognise the whole phrase throughone rule.
So, we ought to predict all possible config-urations of words and write a lot of rules that identifysubsequent permutations of keywords, which mightbe difficult.
Thus, some omissions of informationcan be caused by insufficient coverage by grammarrules (see sec.
4).The information we searched for can be dividedinto two types.
Many facts were originally writtenin the documents in a standardised way, for examplethe value of the BMI parameter, or phrases describ-ing complications.
For these parts of information,the probability of error is rather small and is relatedmostly to the occurrence of complicated negation orcoordination.
But some of the features can be ex-pressed in many ways.
In this case, the program re-call can depend on the particular physicians?
writingstyles.
An example is the information about contin-uation of diabetes treatment.
In this case we haveto identify information about continuation of a treat-ment (can be expressed in many ways) in the con-text of a phrases denoting diabetes.
This context isimportant because, in the texts, there are sometimesphrases describing continuation of treatment of notdiabetes but other illness.
A few samples are givenbelow:?
Kontynuowano leczenie cukrzycy dotychcza-sowym systemem wielokrotnych wstrzyknie?c?
?The diabetes treatment was continued on thesame basis of multiple injections?,?
Utrzymano dotychczasowy system wielokrot-nych wstrzyknie?c?
insuliny ?The current systemof multiple insulin injections has been main-tained?,?
Kontynuowano dotychczasowy schematleczenia cukrzycy ?The current schema ofdiabetes treatment was continued?,?
Kontynuowano dotychczasowe leczeniehipotensyjne ?The current treatment of hy-potension was continued?
?
this phrase is notabout diabetes!A fact that a patient was educated for diabetes isanother example of information which can be ex-pressed in many ways.
Any phrase indicating thata patient was informed or taught about somethingor something was discussed with a patient is inter-preted as the information about education.
We arenot interested in details of education but still wehave to recognise 13 different constructions describ-ing education.?

From above 60 attributes, the partial eval-uation concerned only 7.
The evaluated attributesare of different type: retinopathy is a keyword butwe still deal with the problem of negation and coor-dination.
Words denoting uncontrolled diabetes canrefer not only to diabetes so they should be recog-nized only in specific contexts.
Attributes: educa-tion and diet modification are represented in the textsby complex phrases.Results are presented in Fig.
10.
The worst resultswere observed for diabetes balance recognition.
Itwas due to the fact that keywords representing thisinformation had to be recognised in the context ofthe word cukrzyca ?diabetes?, (see 3.3) and some-times the distance between these words is too far.

The attribute values included within it weresubsequently introduced into a relational databasewhich can be searched and analysed.
At the databasefilling stage some additional postprocessing of datawas done.
This concerned, among others, the fol-lowing problems:?
detection and omission of information of pa-tient not suffering from diabetes,?
detection and omission of not complete data(reports not sufficiently filled up with data),?
omission of redundant data and choosing themost detailed information (e.g.
about types ofcomplications)?
selecting highest levels for blood test results.The database consists of 20 tables containing all ex-tracted information about a patient, his/her illnessand the recommended treatment.
At the moment, thedatabase contains 388 hospitalisation descriptions of387 patients.
254 cases were qualified as diabetestype 2, 129 as type 1 and 5 as type other.
556 com-plications for 256 patients and 304 insulin treatmentschemas have been recognised.6 System Overview and EvaluationThe main aim of the work was creation of a systemthat processes diabetic patients?
hospital documenta-tion automatically and inserts the extracted data intoa relational database.
The database can be searchedfor using SQL queries or a specialized program ded-icated for doctors which enables queries by exam-ple.
The system architecture is given in Fig.
11.
Theprocessing procedure consisted of four stages:?
text preprocessing including format unificationand data anonymization (Perl scripts),?
information extraction based on the domainmodel (Prot?g?
), Polish morphological lexicon(Morfeusz) and the domain lexicon,?
postprocessing: data cleaning and structuring(Perl scripts),?
insertion data into a relational database (Post-gres).The evaluation of the system was done simultane-ously with IE evaluation on the same set of 50 re-ports.
The results are presented in Fig.

We plane to use ourtools for creating annotated corpora (manually cor-rected) which are necessary for training statisticalmodels.Of course the portability of the method is poor.The grammars written for a particular domain canbe developed to cover more facts and details but theirextendibility to another domain is problematic.AcknowledgmentThis work was done in cooperation with Br?dnowskiHospital in Warsaw and was partially financed bythe Polish national project number 3 T11C 007 27.ReferencesRazvan Bunescu, Ruifang Ge, Rohit.
