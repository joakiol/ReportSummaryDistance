PARAMAX SYSTEMS CORPORATION :DESCRIPTION OF THE PARAMAX SYSTEM USED FOR MUC- 4Carl Weir and Barry Silk 1Valley Forge Lab sParamax Systems CorporationPaoli, Pennsylvaniaweir 0prc .unisys.corn215-648-2369INTRODUCTIO NThis paper describes the Paramax MUC-4 data extraction system, a system with an analysis componentimplemented in CLIPS that provides a level of text understanding that falls somewhere between what ispossible with conventional information retrieval techniques and deep linguistic analysis .The Paramax MUC-4 system is a reimplementation of ideas originally introduced in the KBIRD system ,which was evaluated in MUC-3 [4, 5] .
There are plans to incorporate linguistic analysis techniques int othe system, but the current effort is focussed on maximizing the data extraction capabilities of simplermethods .
The Paramax MUC-4 system is depicted in Figure 1 .APPROACH AND SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONThe Paramax MUC-4 system's architecture consists of three main processing components .
An initialpreprocessing component generates a set of CLIPS facts in which words, sentences, and paragraphs areidentified .
This component also computes the likelihood of relevant types of events being described in agiven text .
A core, rule-based analysis component implemented in CLIPS extracts whatever informationcan be inferred on the basis of the CLIPS facts generated by the preprocessor and the system's application -specific rule base .
Finally, a third, template generation component sorts through all of the facts thathave been inferred, merging descriptions of identical events and generating collections of templates in a nappropriate format .The Preprocessing ComponentThe preprocessing component is implemented in a programming language specifically designed for pro-cessing textual data called PERL .
2 During preprocessing, words, sentences, paragraphs and punctuationmarks are delimited.
In addition, every word in the text is checked against a set of keyword profiles .These profiles are pairs of words and conditional probabilities representing types of events : arsons, at -tacks, bombings, kidnappings, robberies, and murders .
Although murders are not treated as a basic typ eof event in the MUC-4 task, the system nevertheless attempts to identify them in order to predict sig-nificant deaths .
If a word occurring in a text also occurs in one of the event profiles with a probabilit ygreater than 55%, then descriptions of instances of that type of event are asserted to likely occur in th etext .
Because the MUC-4 training sample is small, the list of words determined to be highly predictive o fa given type of event is hand-edited to eliminate entries that have been assigned high scores because o fsparse data.The preprocessor's average elapsed processing time per text in the MUC-4 TST3 data set of 100 textsis less than 3 seconds .
Total elapsed preprocessing time for the data set is 4 minutes, 8 seconds .
It tookapproximately three days to write the preprocessor, and another three or four days to create and tune th eevent profiles it uses .l Barry Silk is a U.S .

CLIPS is a forward-chaining system developed at NASA's Johnso nSpace Center that has received a lot of attention lately because of its speed and low cost .
Rule-base dsystems similar to CLIPS have been used before to implement data extraction systems ; two well-know nimplementations of this sort are the Carnegie Group's Text Categorization Shell [3] and the ADS Rubricsystem, which is a subcomponent of the Codex system evaluated at MUC-3 [1] .CBAS rule format .
An important feature of CBAS rules is that the facts which the rules infer ar eassociated with specific regions of text in very much the same way that edges in a parser's well-forme dsubstring table are assigned to specific regions of an input string .
In the KBIRD system referred to earlier ,the region assigned to an inferred fact is automatically computed to be the maximal cumulative span o fthe regions of text associated with each expression in the antecedent of the rule making the inference.In CBAS, this region must be explicitly specified .
Giving up the automated computation of the regio nprovides more flexibility.Unlike typical parsers, which contain an implicit constraint that adjacent constituents in a rule must b erealized by contiguous strings of text in the input, CBAS requires all constraints to be explicitly encoded .In the earlier KBIRD system, constraints were realized using operators expressing relationships amon gthe text regions associated with facts .
In CBAS, relationships are expressed via constraints on attribute sof facts rather than with operators taking facts as arguments .The following example of a CBAS rule states that if the text preprocessor has predicted the likel yoccurrence of a bombing event and if the lexical item dynamited occurs in the text being analysed, the na bombing event instance is to be predicted at the same location as the occurrence of the lexical item :(defrule bombing-dynamite d(control-fact (phase events) )(probable_event (type "BOMBING") )(vord (lex "DYNAMITED")(pp ?P)(ss ?S)(left ?L)(right ?R) )_> (assert (bombing (id =(gensym))(key "DYNAMITED")(pp ?P)(ss ?S)(left ?L)(right ?R))) )The following two CBAS rules illustrate how rudimentary phrases can be constructed .
In this case ,proper names are recognized through examination of a database of known names, and proper names tha tare next to one another are concatenated together to form compound phrases .
(defrule assert-proper-name(control-fact (phase hum-proper) )(word (lex ?LEX)(pp ?P)(ss ?S)(left ?L)(right ?R) )(knovn_name (lex ?LEX) )_>(assert (proper_name (lex ?LEX)(pp ?P)(ss ?S)(left ?Wright ?R))) )(defrule assert-proper-name-phras e(control-fact (phase hum-proper) )?fl <- (proper_name (lex ?LEX1)(pp ?P)(ss ?S)(left ?L1)(right ?R1) )?f2 <- (proper_name (lex ?LEX2)(pp ?P)(aa ?S)(left ?R1)(right ?R2) )_>(assert (proper_name (lex =(format nil "%s %s" ?LEX1 ?LEX2))(pp ?P)(ss ?S)(left ?L1)(right ?R2)) )(retract ?fl )(retract ?f2))244Processing Phases/Rule modules .
Following standard practice in forward-chaining system develop-ment, the antecedent portions of CBAS rules include references to control fact statements .
These controlfacts are asserted and retracted during the processing of a text to enable or disable portions of the Ret enetwork constructed out of the system's rule base .'
Through the use of control facts, different inferencin gphases can be defined and the rules associated with these phases constitute separate modules, some o fwhich may be used in other domains and/or applications .
Three different types of rule modules arise :Event attribute rule modules .
Modules of this sort consist of rules which infer' facts describing pos-sible properties of events without associating those properties with any specific event instance .
Forexample, a rule module exists whose only goal is to identify proper name expressions .
Similarly, arule module exists that identifies possible physical targets .Event instance rule modules .
Modules of this sort consist of rules which locate instances of types o fevents .
There is only one module of this sort in the MUC-4 implementation, but multiple modulesof this sort could exist .
For example, it might be desirable to have separate modules for each even ttype .Slotvaluerule modules .
Modules of this sort consist of rules which infer possible slot values for tem -plates describing event instances .
Facts inferred by rules in this type of module are weighted .Key CBAS features .
The most significant features of CBAS are the following :?
CBAS is implemented in CLIPS, which can be acquired at little or no cost .4?
The implementation is reasonably fast, with an average processing time per text in the MUC-4 TST 3data set of 1 minute, 46 seconds .
Total processing time for all 100 messages in the data set is 2hours, 57 minutes .
'?
The implementation was built quickly, in about 2 months with less than 4 person-months of effort .
'?
The CBAS rule formalism is easy to learn and requires no linguistic expertise .
Most of the ruleswritten for the MUC-4 prototype were written by someone with no background in linguistics .A Template Generato rAfter the CBAS component has inferred whatever information can be extracted from a given text, athird module is responsible for generating templates based on the factbase that has been created .
Threetasks are performed by the template generator :1.
It selects the actual templates that should be produced as output .2.
It chooses among candidate slot fillers if more than one filler has been found .3.
It prints the actual templates in the proper format .6 A Rete network is a data structure commonly used to encode information in forward-chaining systems.
See Forgy [2] fo ran explanation of Rete networks.4 It can be acquired at no cost for NASA and USAF projects and at a marginal cost for all other uses ($490.00, includinga three volume set of documentation).
'Total processing time including non-CLIPS processing (PERL preprocessing and PROLOG template generation) is 3 2hours for the TST3 data set .6 We did not remember to actually write down the date we started .
We have estimated two months because we know thatCLIPS was installed at our site on 7 April 92 and we know that we stopped development on 30 May 1992 .
We had accessto some old rulebases that were created for the MUC-3 KBIRD system, but these were expressed in a sufficiently differen trule formalism to require a total rewrite .
We estimate less than 4 person-months of effort because only two individuals wer einvolved, and both individuals were required to perform other tasks in addition to their work on MUC-4 .245Template Selection.
The process of determining which template structures to build out of the fact sinferred by CBAS begins by determining if any events at all have been predicted .
If no event has beenpredicted, then an "irrelevant template" is created .
If several events of the same type have been created ,the template.
generator will attempt to merge them using a set of heuristics which hypothesize that tw oevent descriptions refer to the same event .
Some of the general heuristics used for merging events of thesame class are the following :?
Merge two events if there is a significant overlap in the text regions found by the event locator rules .?
Merge two events if they share human targets whose scores are above a certain threshold .?
Merge two events if they share physical targets whose scores are above a certain threshold .Slot Filler Selection .
After merging events, the template generator must select the final slot fillervalues .
The CBAS rules which propose slot fillers attach a score (an integer between 0 and 100) to eac hcandidate which represents the system's confidence in that value .
If multiple candidate fillers exist for agiven template, several general heuristics are used to select among them :?
Candidate slot values with scores below a given threshold are dropped from consideration .?
A set of synonymous expressions are dropped in favor of their canonical expression .?
If one candidate expression is a substring of another, then the shorter one is dropped .?
A generic description (e .g ., vehicles) is dropped in favor of one or more subsumed ones (e .g ., ambu-lance, truck) .?
If a slot can only take a single value then the candidate receiving the highest value is selected .The template generator is fast, with an average processing time per text in the MUC-4 TST3 data se tof 11 seconds .
Total processing time for all 100 texts in the MUC-4 TST3 data set was 17 minutes, 4 4seconds.AN EXTENDED EXAMPL EIn this section, we illustrate in a more concrete fashion how the Paramax MUC-4 system goes abou tprocessing messages by examining in detail what happens during the processing of a specific text, messag eTST2-MUC4-0048, in the MUC-4 corpus .
?
Our discussion will proceed through the three stages of tex tprocessing that have been identified .First Stage: Text PreprocessingFigure 2 contains a sampling of the CLIPS text facts created during the preprocessing stage for TST2-MUC4-0048 .
The msgsocation, msg.date, and msg.src facts are extracted from the text dateline .
Theword facts identify the locations of lexical items, and the ss and pp facts identify the locations of sentenc eand paragraph boundaries, respectively .
For this message, three types of events were predicted : attacks ,bombings, and murders.Second Stage : CLIPS-Based Analysi sAt the start of the second stage of processing, the set of CLIPS facts generated during the preprocessin gstage are asserted to the CBAS factbase .
Once this is done, the forward-chaining engine is invoked toextract information .?
Appendix F contains the text and answer key templates for TST2-MUC4-0048 .246(msgiocation (id "SAN SALVADOR") )(msg .date (day "19")(month "APR")(year "89") )(msgsrc (lex "ACAN-EFE") )(word (pp 1) (ss 1) (left 0) (right 1) (lex "SALVADORAN") )(word (pp 1) (ss 1) (left 1) (right 2) (lex "PRESIDENT-ELECT") )(word (pp 1) (ss 1) (left 2) (right 3) (lex "ALFREDO") )(word (pp 1) (ss 1) (left 3) (right 4) (lex "CRISTIANI") )(word (pp 2) (ss 2) (left 26) (right 27) (lex "LEGISLATIVE") )(word (pp 2) (ss 2) (left 27) (right 28) (lex "ASSEMBLY") )(word (pp 2) (ss 2) (left 28) (right 29) (lex "PRESIDENT") )(word (pp 2) (ss 2) (left 29) (right 30) (lex "RICARDO") )(ss (num 1) (pp 1) (left 0) (right 26) )(ss (num 2) (pp 1) (left 26) (right 84) )(pp (num 1) (left 0) (right 26) )(pp (num 2) (left 26) (right 55) )(predicted?vent_type (type "ATTACK") )(predictedeventlype (type "BOMBING") )(predictedeventtype (type "MURDER") )Figure 2 : Some of the preprocessing output for Message TST2-MUC4-0048 .Since linguistic analysis techniques are not incorporated into the system, information about subcon-stituent structure is limited .
Constraints of this sort on the system's data extraction capabilities areinherent constraints .
The system also contains accidental constraints, which are caused by engineerin gflaws in the system and not by inherent limitations in the extraction methods being employed .It is often not obvious that a data extraction problem is a consequence of an inherent constraint o ran accidental one, or if it is a consequence of some combination of inherent and accidental constraints .From the perspective of the MUC-4 conference, detecting inherent constraints is more interesting tha ndetecting accidental constraints .
Keeping this in mind, performance characteristics of the CBAS analysi scomponent will now be described by examining some of the slot values extracted by the system for messag eTST2-MUC4-0048 .Event instance location .
Because of the event type predictions made during the preprocessing stage ,the system is primed to look for instances of attacks, murders, and bombings in TST2-MUC4-0048 .
In theCBAS system, each reference to a given type of event detected in a text is treated as if it is referring to adifferent event instance .
It is up to the template generation component to determine that the template sdescribing different event instances are in fact describing the same event .
A key problem with the MUC- 4implementation is that this identification process is not working well, leading to an excessive number o fspurious values .For TST2-MUC4-0048, the MUC-4 CBAS system generated 4 response templates .
The first templatedescribes a terrorist act identified as an attack, but for which a bomb is correctly identified as an instru-ment .
Given the presence of a bomb as an instrument, the failure to identify the event as a bombing i sclearly the consequence of an indequately developed rule base and not the result of any inherent constrain tin the methodology being used .It is important to keep in mind that many event instances are created during the data extraction process ,and that the goal is to identify instances of the same actual event and merge their template structures .A number of bombing event instances were generated for this message, as expected given the number o freferences to bombs and explosions .
However, since the event instances leading to the generation of thefirst response template were identified as attacks, their template structures were not merged with those o fbombing instances .
A total of three other spurious templates all of which were identified as description sof bombings, were generated for the sample text .247Description Fille rO .

In the first response template generated for TST2-MUC4-0048, the strin g"AN INDIVIDUAL" was recorded as the perpetrator id, based on the occurrence of this phrase in thethe clause "AN INDIVIDUAL PLACED A BOMB ON THE ROOF OF THE ARMORED VEHICLE" .The correct string fill, "URBAN GUERRILLAS" was also extracted by CBAS, but the former value wa sassigned a higher score .
The following ground clauses were generated by CBAS to represent these strings :potential_ind_perpetrator('TERRORISTS'," 'URBAN GUERRILLAS") .potential_ind_perpetrator('UNKNOWN'," 'AN INDIVIDUAL") .Unfortunately, the type specification for "URBAN GUERRILLAS" should have been output as 'TER-RORIST ' , not 'TERRORISTS' .
Had this been done, then the following rule would have assigned a highe rscore to "URBAN GUERRILLAS" .
(defrule perp-attack-events-3(control-fact (phase perp-events) )(actual_event (id ?id) (class "ATTACK") (sa ?ss) )(potential_ind_perpetrator (type "TERRORIST") (name ?p) (as ?as) )=>(assert (tmp (id ?id)(slot slot09)(val ?p)(prob 85))) )Since no rules exist for assigning probabilities to possible perpetrators of type "TERRORISTS", th efollowing CBAS rule assigned a relatively low score to "URBAN GUERRILLAS " as a possible fill fo rslot 9 :(defrule perp-all-events- 1(control-fact (phase perp-events) )(actual_event (id ?id)(ss ?as) )(potential_ind_perpetrator (name ?p)(ss ?ss) )a >(assert (tmp (id ?id)(slot slot09)(val ?p)(prob 50))) )The following rule assigned a much higher weight to "AN INDIVIDUAL" :(defrule perp-attack-events- 6(control-fact (phase perp-events) )(actual_event (id ?id) (class "ATTACK") (sa ?as) )(potential_ind_perpetrator (type "UNKNOWN") (name ?p) (sa ?as) )(assert (tmp (id ?id)(slot slot09)(val ?p)(prob 75))) )This type of error in the rule base could have been caught with a bit more staffing and/or developmen ttime and is characteristic of relatively simple bugs that have a significant cumulative impact on dat aextraction performance .Extracting physical targets .
Two separate problems are manifested in the slot values proposed forphysical targets in the first response template generated for TST2-MUC4-0048 .The first problem is evidenced by the failure of the system to determine that "CAR" and "ARMOREDVEHICLE" are co-referential .
The ability to establish co-referentiality is minimal in the CBAS system ,and this weakness is probably inherent in the methodology .
However, in this particular case, the CBASrule base could be expanded to treat "CAR" and "ARMORED VEHICLE" as synonyms and therefor esubmit only one of them as a reference to a physical target .
Were this done, the problem that would the narise is the need to recognize when two separate objects are in fact being talked about .249The second problem evidenced in the extraction of physical targets is the presence of "HOME" as apossible value, along with "CAR" and "ARMORED VEHICLE" .
It turns out that the CBAS rule bas eproposed two separate attack event instances, one for the bomb attack on Alvarado 's car, and one fo rthe bomb attack on Merino ' s home.
However, the template generator component, which is responsibl efor merging templates describing the same event, erroneously merged the templates describing these tw oseparate attack instances, combining their physical target slot values .
Not enough time was available todevelop template merging heuristics .Extracting Human Targets .
A number of spurious human target values are proposed in the firs tresponse template .
Many of these spurious values have arisen because of a poorly tuned rule base and no tbecause of any inherent contraints in the analysis techniques employed .
If finer-grained rule weightingswere to be employed so that strings describing human targets which are located relatively near a region o ftext triggering the detection of an event instance are preferred over others, then many of these spuriou svalues would not be present .The human targets "RICARDO VALDIVIESO" "ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO", "LEADER" ,"JUSTICE", "DRIVER", and "BODYGUARDS" were all proposed with equal likelihood as possibl eslot values for an event instance detected through the occurrence of the word "KILLED" in the phrase"VIOLENCE THAT KILLED ATTORNEY GENERAL GARCIA . "
If a higher score were assigned t ohuman targets immediately following "KILLED", then the other values could be eliminated .
This couldmost certainly be done, and in fact was done in the KBIRD implementation described earlier .
For thi stype of finer-grained score assignment, it would make sense to employ a part-of-speech tagger that is ableto distinguish simple past tense forms from past participles used in passive constructions .8It is less clear how to reintroduce "DRIVER" and "BODYGUARDS" as slot values, given that the ywill not be introduced if the suggested improvements in rule scoring are made .
It is in the following twosentences that it is made clear that the driver and bodyguards were also targets : "ACCORDING T OTHE POLICE GARCIA ALVARADO'S DRIVER, WHO ESCAPED UNSCATHED, THE ATTORNE YGENERAL WAS TRAVELING WITH TWO BODYGUARDS .
ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED ."
Rulescould certainly be written to capture these additional human targets .
For example, rules could be sensitiveto the existence of individuals who "ESCAPE UNSCATHED" and to groups of individuals, some of who mare injured and that are "TRAVELING WITH" a highly likely human target .
But it is not clear if onewould ever be able to write enough rules in a given domain to reach closure in extracting all human target sthat are referred to in this sort of indirect fashion .The string "URBAN TERRORISTS VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT" arises as a reference to a huma ntarget because of a bug in one of the CBAS rules that builds up compound common noun phrases .
Inthis case, the rule was not written to pay attention to sentence boundaries, and consequently the commonnoun "URBAN TERRORISTS" occurring at the end of one sentence and "VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT "occurring at the beginning of the next sentence were incorrectly identified as a single common nou nexpression .
Correcting this type of error is easy.The string "SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT" should have been recognized as a title of Alfred oCristiani in the phrase ?
"SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI" .
A bug in on eof the CBAS rules that recognizes titles next to proper names was to blame.
If a common noun expressionis recognized as a title, it is not proposed as a separate reference to an individual .
The presense of AlfredoChristiani as a possible victim could have been eliminated by the improvement in scoring technique smentioned earlier .Finally, the string "INDIVIDUAL" arises as a reference to a human target .
This error could have beeneliminated by improved scoring techniques .
Also, since "AN INDIVIDUAL" occurs as a perpetrator ,improved template merging heuristics should have eliminated one of the values as a candidate filler .8 Unfortunately, we have been told that taggers generally perform poorly in discriminating passive past participles fro msimple past tense forms and participles used in past perfect constructions.250Third Stage : Template GenerationTime and funding constraints made it impossible to implement a satisfactory template generation com-ponent for this system .In the previous discussion of the analysis component's performance, references were made to casesin which the template generator merged template descriptions when it shouldn 't have .
In many cases ,the opposite is true .
For example, two of the four templates generated for TST2-MUC4-0048 are exac tduplicates of one another .
Moreover, the duplicates are relatively impoverished, containing no physica ltargets, and only one reference to "BODY" as a human target descriptor .
With a little cooperation fromthe rule base to eliminate "BODY" as a human target, the generator should be able to justify not printin gthe underpopulated templates, and in any case, an existing heuristic for not printing exact duplicates o ftemplates needs to be fixed .CONCLUSION SA key motivating factor in the design of the Paramax MUC-4 system has been a desire to exploit simpledata extraction methods to the fullest extent possible .
Another motivating factor has been the desir eto build a relatively inexpensive system that individuals with no training whatsoever in linguistics coul ddevelop and maintain .We do not believe that we have fully exploited the capabilities of non-linguistic data extraction method sand intend to continue to explore the simpler techniques used in the CBAS system .
This intention i snot based on a strongly-held desire to avoid the use of linguistic-analysis techniques in data extractionapplications .
Quite the contrary?our research group is actively involved in the development of linguisti canalysis techniques and feels that they will ultimately be essential in data extraction applications .
OurMUC-4 implementation is part of a long-term effort to better understand exactly when such techniquesare in fact required .Except for the template generator, which is written in Prolog, the Paramax MUC-4 system has bee nbuilt using freeware (PERL and CLIPS) .
Each component is written in a different programming language ,which is a strong indicator of its modularity .Finally, we have demonstrated by example that the approach taken in the Paramax MUC-4 system doe snot require any linguistic expertise .
A general knowledge of the domain is all that is required .
Acquirin gan understanding of the CBAS rule formalism and of CLIPS in general takes very little time?the tw oindividuals that developed the MUC-4 system had no prior experience whatsoever with CLIPS .REFERENCES[1] Laura Blumer Balcom and Richard M .
