1 Introduction It has been recognized for quite some time that sustainable data formats play an important role in the development and curation of linguistic resources.
As witnessed by the success of the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative 1 (TEI) and of published standards issued by the International Standards Organization 2  (ISO), markup languages such as XML3 (short for: Extensible Markup Language) have become lingua francas for encoding linguistic resources of different types, including phonetic transcrip-                                                1 See http://www.tei-c.org 2 See http://www.iso.org 3 See http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/tions, (annotated) text corpora, and dictionar-ies.
It is fair to say that it has become common practice among developers of new linguistic resources to consult TEI guidelines and ISO standards in order to develop standard-conformant encoding schemes that serve as an interchange format and that can be docu-mented and validated by Document Type Definitions (DTD) and XML schemata.
However, for resources that were developed prior to or largely in parallel with the emerging acceptance of markup languages and of emerg-ing encoding standards, the situation is far more heterogeneous.
A wide variety of legacy formats exists, many of which have persisted due to existing user communities and the availability of tools that can process only such idiosyncratic formats.
The development of wordnets for a large number of languages is a typical example of a type of linguistic re-source, where legacy formats still persist as a de facto standard.
WordNet 1.6 is encoded in the data format of lexicographer files4 that was designed for the English Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
It is a plain-text format for storing wordnet data and allows lexicographers to encode lexical and conceptual relations among lexical units and synsets by use of spe-cial-purpose diacritics.
There exist numerous tools that can process WordNet 1.6 lexicogra-pher files to extract relevant information or to transform the data into other special-purpose formats such as Prolog-fact databases.
Even tough still widely used for the reasons just mentioned, the complexity of the format itself has a number of undesirable consequences.
As Henrich and Hinrichs (2010) have pointed out,                                                 4 See http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/lexnames.5 WN.html456the editing of lexicographer files is highly er-ror-prone and time-consuming in actual lexi-cographic development.
Moreover, format validation of the data as well as development of new tools for data visualization and data extraction become increasingly difficult since they cannot be based on generic state-of-the-art tools, that are, for example, available for XML-based encodings.
For exactly these reasons, XML-based inter-change formats have been proposed in recent years also for wordnets.
One of the first, if not the first, example is the XML format for Ger-maNet5, a wordnet for German (Lemnitzer and Kunze, 2002; Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010).
An even more recent development along these lines is the specification of Wordnet-LMF (see Soria et al, 2009), an instantiation of the Lexi-cal Markup Framework6 (LMF, (Francopoulo et al, 2006)) customized for wordnets.
Since LMF is an ISO standard (ISO-24613), it is a particularly attractive candidate for en-coding wordnets.
Everything else being equal, ISO standards have a high chance of being adopted by a wide user community and of be-ing recognized as an interchange format.7 Such agreed-upon interchange formats are a crucial prerequisite for interoperable linguistic re-sources in the context of web services and of processing pipelines for linguistic resources.
The purpose of this paper is threefold: 1.
To compare and contrast the GermaNet XML initially proposed by Lemnitzer and Kunze (2002) with the Wordnet-LMF.
This comparison is instructive since it reveals two completely differ-ent conceptions of representing seman-tic knowledge at the lexical level.
2.
To point out a number of open issues that need to be resolved if Wordnet-LMF is to be adopted widely among5 See http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/GermaNet/ 6 See http://www.lexicalmarkupframework.org 7 An anonymous reviewer raised the question why OWL is not a good candidate for encoding wordnets.
On this issue, we agree with the assessment of Soria et al (2009) who point out that ?[?]
RDF and OWL are conceptual repositories representation formats that are not designed to represent polysemy and store linguistic properties of words and word meanings.
?wordnets for a steadily increasing number of languages.
3.
To show how these open issues can be resolved in a customized version of Wordnet-LMF suitable for GermaNet.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides a general introduc-tion to GermaNet.
Details about the adapted XML format used for GermaNet up until now are provided in section 3.
Section 4 introduces the challenge of how to represent a wordnet in the Lexical Markup Framework.
As one possi-bility, Wordnet-LMF is regarded.
Issues that arise during the conversion of GermaNet into Wordnet-LMF lead to a modified version of Wordnet-LMF.
Finally, section 5 concludes with a comparison of the two representation formats.
2 GermaNet GermaNet is a lexical semantic network that is modeled after the Princeton WordNet for Eng-lish.
It partitions the lexical space into a set of concepts that are interlinked by semantic rela-tions.
A semantic concept is modeled by a syn-set.
A synset is a set of words (called lexical units) where all the words are taken to have (almost) the same meaning.
Thus a synset is a set-representation of the semantic relation of synonymy, which means that it consists of a list of lexical units and a paraphrase (repre-sented as a string).
The lexical units in turn have frames (which specify the syntactic va-lence of the lexical unit) and examples.
The list of lexical units for a synset is never empty, but any of the other properties may be.
There are two types of semantic relations in GermaNet: conceptual and lexical relations.
Conceptual relations hold between two seman-tic concepts, i.e.
synsets.
They include rela-tions such as hyperonymy, part-whole rela-tions, entailment, or causation.
Lexical rela-tions hold between two individual lexical units.
Antonymy, a pair of opposites, is an example of a lexical relation.
GermaNet covers the three word categories of adjectives, nouns, and verbs, each of which is hierarchically structured in terms of the hy-peronymy relation of synsets.457Figure 1.
Structure of the XML synset files.
3 Current GermaNet XML Format The structure of the XML files closely follows the internal structure of GermaNet, which means that the file structure mirrors the under-lying relational organization of the data.
There are two DTDs that jointly describe the XML-encoded GermaNet.
One DTD represents all synsets with their lexical units and their attrib-utes (see subsection 3.1).
The other DTD rep-resents all relations, both conceptual and lexi-cal relations (see subsection 3.2).
The GermaNet XML format was initially developed by Kunze and Lemnitzer (2002), but modifications of the GermaNet data itself led to an adopted XML format, which is presented here.8 3.1 XML Synset Files The XML files that represent all synsets and lexical units of GermaNet are organized around the three word categories currently in-cluded in GermaNet: nouns, adjectives, and verbs (altogether 54 synset files since the se-mantic space for each word category is divided into a number of semantic subfields).
The structure of each of these files is illus-trated in Figure 19.
Each synset represents a set of lexical units (lexUnits) which all express the same meaning.
This grouping represents the                                                 8 The interested reader might compare the version at hand with (Lemnitzer and Kunze, 2002) or (Kunze and Lem-nitzer, 2002), which both describe the initial GermaNet XML version.
9 In fact, this figure is not quite complete for the reason of simplicity.semantic relation of synonymy.
Further prop-erties of a synset (e.g., the word category or a describing paraphrase) and a lexical unit (e.g., a sense number or the orthographical form (orthForm)) are encoded appropriately.
Figure 1 describes the underlying XML structure.
Each box in the figure stands for an element in the XML files, and the properties in each box (listed underneath the wavy line) rep-resent the attributes of an XML element.
This means, for example, that a synset element has the attributes of an id and a category.10 Figure 2 shows an example of a synset with two lexical units (lexUnit elements) and a paraphrase.
The lexUnit elements in turn con-tain several attributes and an orthographical form (the orthForm element), e.g., leuchten (German verb for: to shine).
The first of the two lexical units even has a frame and an ex-ample.
<synset id="s58377" category="verben">   <lexUnit id="l82207"            sense="1"            namedEntity="no"            artificial="no"            styleMarking="no">     <orthForm>leuchten</orthForm>     <frame>NN</frame>     <example>       <text>         Der Mond leuchtete in der Nacht.
</text>       <exframe>NN</exframe>     </example>   </lexUnit>   <lexUnit id="l82208"                                                 10 Note that XML element or attribute names appear italic if they are referenced in the text.458sense="2"            namedEntity="no"            artificial="no"            styleMarking="no">     <orthForm>strahlen</orthForm>   </lexUnit>   <paraphrase>     Lichtstrahlen aussenden,     gro?e Helligkeit verbreiten   </paraphrase> </synset> Figure 2.
Synset file example.
3.2 XML Relation File This type of XML file represents both kinds of relations: conceptual and lexical relations.
All relations are encoded within one XML file, whose structure is illustrated in Figure 3.Figure 3.
Structure of the XML relation file.
The boxes in Figure 3 again represent XML elements, which means that there is one rela-tions element that contains all lexical relations (lex_rel elements) and conceptual relations (con_rel elements).
Both relation types contain several attributes.
Figure 4 illustrates an example for each of the two relation types.
The type of the concep-tual relation is hyperonymy (indicated by the name attribute), and it holds between the syn-set with ID s58377 (from attribute) and the synset with ID s58376 (to attribute).
The lexi-cal relation is of type antonymy (again indi-cated by the name attribute), and holds be-tween the lexical units with the IDs l2471 (from attribute) and l12470 (to attribute).<con_rel name="hyperonymy"          from="s58377" to="s58376"          dir="revert" inv="hyponymy" /> <lex_rel name="antonymy"          from="l2471" to="l2470"          dir="both" /> Figure 4.

4 Wordnet-LMF The Lexical Markup Framework (ISO-24613) is an ISO standard for encoding natural lan-guage processing lexicons and machine read-able dictionaries (Francopoulo et al, 2006).
The intention of LMF is to provide a common model for the creation and use of lexical re-sources, to manage the exchange of data be-tween and among these resources, and to en-able the merging of a large number of individ-ual electronic resources to form extensive global electronic resources.
4.1 The Challenge The core structure of LMF is based on the pro-totypical structuring of a lexicon in terms of lexical entries, each of which enumerates the different senses of the lexical item in question.
This word-driven perspective contrasts the synset-driven relational structure of wordnets ?
the grouping of word senses (i.e., lexical units) that express the same meaning into synsets.
Exactly these two radically different organiz-ing principles (relation-based in the case of wordnets versus lexical-entry-based in the case of LMF) constitute the challenge of encoding wordnets in LMF.
We take up this challenge: How can a synset-based wordnet, e.g.
Ger-maNet, be represented in a word-driven format like LMF?
4.2 Apply LMF to Wordnets The conversion of GermaNet to LMF will build on Wordnet-LMF (Soria et al, 2009; Lee et al, 2009), an existing Lexical Markup Framework subset11.
Wordnet-LMF has been developed in the context of the EU KYOTO                                                11 Wordnet-LMF is a proper subset of LMF since there are specifications in LMF that are not in Wordnet-LMF and since there is nothing in Wordnet-LMF which is not in LMF.
Soria et al (2009) themselves refer to Wordnet-LMF as an LMF dialect.459Figure 5.
The Wordnet-LMF structure.
project12 and is especially tailored to encode wordnets in the LMF standard.
Wordnet-LMF is specified by a Document Type Definition (see Appendix E in (Soria and Monachini, 2008)) and fully complies with standard LMF.
The Wordnet-LMF XML structure is shown in Figure 513 .
There is a Lexical Resource which contains at least one Lexicon (in this case a wordnet lexicon).14 A Lexical Entry rep-resents a word entry in a Lexicon, where the word itself is represented by the writtenForm attribute of the Lemma element.
Lexical En-tries group different Senses of a particular word.
The Senses have a synset attribute that relates them to a Synset element by the corre-sponding ID.
If two Senses have the same syn-set attribute, they belong to the same Synset and are thus synonyms.
A Synset can have several relations to other Synsets.
These relations are encoded in Syn-setRelation elements.
12 See http://www.kyoto-project.eu 13 Note that this figure does not show the whole Wordnet-LMF model.
Only the monolingual part that is relevant for this paper is represented.
The representation of multi-lingual resources (i.e., the optional SenseAxis element with its children) is not considered in this paper.
For a complete picture, see Soria et Monachini (2008).
14 Here, XML element or attribute names again appear italic if they are referenced in the text.4.3 Apply Wordnet-LMF to GermaNet The differences between the synset-driven structure of GermaNet (see Figures 1 and 3) and the word-driven format of Wordnet-LMF (see Figure 5) are obvious.
But there is also a strong commonality: Both formats have synset elements that cluster synonymous words.
In GermaNet, the words are represented by lexi-cal units that are child elements of a synset.
In Wordnet-LMF, senses, which correspond to the lexical units in GermaNet, are linked to a synset (by an attribute containing a synset ID).
The conversion of GermaNet to Wordnet-LMF proceeds as follows: Each lexical unit of GermaNet is turned into a Sense element in Wordnet-LMF (see Figure 5).
The synset at-tribute (containing a Synset ID) of the Sense element links this Sense with the Synset that it is a member of.
The different Sense elements are grouped by their orthographical form (the Lemma in Wordnet-LMF) into Lexical Entries.
An example of a GermaNet LexicalEntry in Wordnet-LMF is shown in Figure 6.
This LexicalEntry represents the word leuchten (German verb for: to shine), as the written-Form attribute of the Lemma element indi-cates.
This LexicalEntry has two Senses, which belong to different Synsets (see the different synset attributes of the Sense elements).460Each Sense has a MonolingualExternalRefs element with at least one MonolingualExter-nalRef representing a reference to an external system.
In this case, each Sense is linked to the corresponding entry in the GermaNet data-base 15 ; the externalReference attribute of a MonolingualExternalRef specifies the database table name with a database ID.
<LexicalEntry id="deu-52-l4601-v">   <Lemma writtenForm="leuchten"                        partOfSpeech="v" />   <Sense id="deu-52-l4601-v_1"                  synset="deu-52-s58377-v">     <MonolingualExternalRefs>       <MonolingualExternalRef         externalSystem="GermaNet-Database"         externalReference=                "lex_uni_table#id=82207" />     </MonolingualExternalRefs>   </Sense>   <Sense id="deu-52-l4601-v_2"                  synset="deu-52-s58718-v">     <MonolingualExternalRefs>       <MonolingualExternalRef         externalSystem="GermaNet-Database"         externalReference=                "lex_uni_table#id=82677" />     </MonolingualExternalRefs>   </Sense> </LexicalEntry> Figure 6.
Example of a LexicalEntry.
In the next conversion step, all synsets of Ger-maNet are listed with their relations to other synsets.
The corresponding Synset (with the ID deu-52-s58377-v) of the first Sense in Figure 6 is illustrated in Figure 7.
It has, inter alia, a describing gloss and two example sentences.
The element SynsetRelations encodes rela-tions to other Synset instances.
The relations are simply encoded with a target attribute that contains the ID of the referencing Synset.
The Synsets in Wordnet-LMF are logically the ?same?
as the synsets in GermaNet XML, i.e.
the concept that a synset expresses is exactly the same in both formats.
Each Synset has a reference to the Ger-maNet database.
Therefore, the Monolin-gualExternalRef element links to the corre-sponding entry in the GermaNet database; the15 For efficency reasons, GermaNet is stored in a relational database.externalReference attribute specifies the data-base table name with the synsets database ID.
<Synset id="deu-52-s58377-v"                           baseConcept="1">   <Definition gloss="Lichtstrahlen                aussenden, gro?e Helligkeit                verbreiten">     <Statement example="Der Mond leuchtete                           in der Nacht.
"/>     <Statement example="Die Lichter der            Stadt strahlen in die Nacht.
"/>   </Definition>   <SynsetRelations>     <SynsetRelation                  target="deu-52-s58376-v"                  relType="has_hyperonym"/>   </SynsetRelations>   <MonolingualExternalRefs>     <MonolingualExternalRef         externalSystem="GermaNet-Database"         externalReference=                  "synset_table#id=58377"/>   </MonolingualExternalRefs> </Synset> Figure 7.
Example of a Synset.
These two Figures 6 and 7 represent the same example in Wordnet-LMF that was already shown in the GermaNet XML format in Figure 1.
4.4 Necessary Modifications to Wordnet-LMF As the previous discussion has shown, Word-net-LMF provides a very useful basis for con-verting GermaNet into LMF.
However, a number of modifications to Wordnet-LMF are needed if this conversion is to preserve all in-formation present in the original resource.
The present section will discuss a number of modi-fications to Wordnet-LMF that are needed for conversion of wordnets in general.
In addition, we will also discuss a set of extensions to Wordnet-LMF that are needed for conversion of GermaNet in particular.
The most glaring omission in Wordnet-LMF concerns the modeling of lexical relations which hold between lexical units (i.e., Senses in the terminology of Wordnet-LMF).
In the current Wordnet-LMF DTD only conceptual relations (i.e., SynsetRelations in the terminol-ogy of Wordnet-LMF), which hold between synsets, are modeled.
Thus antonymy, which is a typical example of a lexical relation (see (Fellbaum, 1998) for further details), can cur-461rently not be modeled without violating the Wordnet-LMF DTD.
Among the synset relations specified in Wordnet-LMF, the entailment relation is miss-ing, which plays a crucial role in the modeling of verbs in the Princeton WordNet and in GermaNet alke.
The list of values of attribute relType for SynsetRelation elements (see Ap-pendix A in (Soria and Monachini, 2008)) therefore has to be amended accordingly.16 A third omission in the current Wordnet-LMF DTD concerns syntactic frames used in the Princeton WordNet to indicate the syntac-tic valence of a given word sense.
Syntactic frames are also used in GermaNet, albeit using a different encoding17.
Syntactic frames to-gether with example sentences, which illustrate the meaning and prototypical usage of a par-ticular word, help to distinguish among word senses.
In WordNet both syntactic frames and ex-amples are linked to synsets.
However, at least in the case of syntactic frames the linkage to synsets seems problematic since different members of the same synset may well have different valence frames.
For example, the German verbs finden and begegnen both mean meet and thus belong to the same synset.
Both are transitive verbs, but their object NPs have different cases: accusative case for treffen and dative case for begegnen.
As this example shows, syntactic frames need to be associated with lexical units rather than synsets.
This is exactly the design choice made in GermaNet, as shown in Figure 1.
A related question concerns the anchoring of example sentences which illustrate the mean-ings and prototypical usage of a particular word sense.
In both the Princeton WordNet and GermaNet such examples are associated16 Piek Vossen (personal communication) has pointed out to us that Wordnet-LMF does not impose a list of rela-tions as a standard yet.
17 In WordNet, frames are encoded in a controlled lan-guage using paraphrases such as Somebody ----s some-thing for a transitive verb with an animate subject and an inanimate object.
The frames in GermaNet use comple-mentation codes provided with the German version of the CELEX Lexical Database (Baayen et al, 2005) such as NN.AN for transitive verbs with accusative objects.with lexical units18.
GermaNet correlates ex-amples additionally with particular syntactic frames and treats both examples and syntactic frames as properties of lexical units, i.e.
Senses in the terminology of Wordnet-LMF.
The above issues lead to a modified version of the Wordnet-LMF DTD as shown in Figure 8.
Compared to Figure 5, the Sense element is enriched by three optional subelements: Sen-seRelations, SenseExamples, and Subcategori-zationFrames.
It has to be noted, though, that LMF proper contains all necessary elements.
The three no-tions SenseRelation, SenseExample, and Sub-categorizationFrame come from LMF proper and these elements can be used to remedy the omissions in Wordnet-LMF.
The SenseRelation element in Figure 8 rep-resents relations between different Senses (the lexical units in GermaNet).
The SenseExam-ples and SubcategorizationFrames elements both group several SenseExample or Subcate-gorizationFrame instances.
A Subcategoriza-tionFrame element represents the syntactic valence of a word sense.
A SenseExample shows the prototypical usage of a word sense as an example sentence.
The syntactic valence for a concrete example sentence can be speci-fied with the optional frame attribute of a Sen-seExample.
5 Conclusion: Comparing GermaNet XML with Wordnet-LMF XML We would like to conclude with a comparison between the GermaNet native XML format described in section 3 and the modified Word-net-LMF format described in section 4.4.
Since the GermaNet native XML format was particu-larly tailored to the structure of GermaNet, it enjoys the usual advantages of such custom-ized solutions: it contains all and only the nec-essary XML elements and attributes to de-scribe the resource.
Moreover, the data are dis-tributed over 55 different XML files, which facilitates easy data handling and efficient search by word classes and lexical fields.
These properties are in fact exploited by a number of GermaNet-specific tools, including                                                18 In WordNet, the examples are placed at the synset level, but referencing to a word sense at the same time.462Figure 8.
Revised Wordnet-LMF structure.
a GermaNet-Explorer, a tool for data explora-tion and retrieval, and a GermaNet Pathfinder, a tool for the calculation of semantic related-ness, similarity, and distance (Cramer and Finthammer, 2008).
All of these tools utilize the Java API that has been developed for the GermaNet native XML format.
At the same time the GermaNet native XML format is a proprietary data format that was developed at a time when the only de facto encoding standard for wordnets consisted of the lexicographer files, originally developed for the Princeton WordNet.
As such GermaNet XML was never developed with the goal of providing an XML standard for modeling wordnets in general.
With Wordnet-LMF a candidate standard has now been proposed that is compliant with the LMF ISO standard for lexical resources and that strives to provide a general encoding standard of wordnets for dif-ferent languages.
As the discussion in section 4.4 has shown, the current Wordnet-LMF DTD still needs to be amended to account for the full range of wordnet relations, frames, and examples (see Figure 8).
These elements are not in Wordnet-LMF because Wordnet-LMF is a subset, but these elements are defined in the ISO document 24613 where LMF proper is defined.
However, Wordnet-LMF appears to be suitably mature to serve as an interchange format for wordnets of different languages aswell as for linking wordnets of different lan-guages with one another19.
