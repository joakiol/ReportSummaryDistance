Memory-Inductive Categorial Grammar:An Approach to Gap Resolution in Analytic-Language TranslationPrachya Boonkwan Thepchai SupnithiHuman Language Technology LaboratoryNational Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)112 Thailand Science Park, Phaholyothin Road,Khlong 1, Pathumthani 12120, Thailand{prachya.boonkwan, thepchai.supnithi}@nectec.or.thAbstractThis paper presents a generalized frame-work of syntax-based gap resolution in ana-lytic language translation using an extendedversion of categorial grammar.
Translat-ing analytic languages into Indo-Europeanlanguages suffers the issues of gapping,because ?deletion under coordination?
and?verb serialization?
are necessary to be re-solved beforehand.
Rudimentary operations,i.e.
antecedent memorization, gap induction,and gap resolution, were introduced to thecategorial grammar to resolve gapping is-sues syntactically.
Hereby, pronominal ref-erences can be generated for deletion undercoordination, while sentence structures canbe properly selected for verb serialization.1 BackgroundAnalytic language, such as Chinese, Thai, and Viet-namese, is any language whose syntax and meaningrelies on particles and word orders rather than inflec-tion.
Pronouns and other grammatical information,such as tense, aspect, and number, expressed by useof adverbs and adjectives, are often omitted.
In addi-tion to deletion under coordination and verb serial-ization, called gapping (Hendriks, 1995), translationfrom analytic languages into Indo-European onesbecomes a hard task because (1) an ordinary parsercannot parse some problematic gapping patterns and(2) these omissions are necessary to be resolved be-forehand.
We classify resolution of the issue intotwo levels: syntactic/semantic and pragmatic.
Gap-ping, which we considered as a set of bound vari-ables, can be resolved in syntactic/semantic level(Partee, 1975).
Omission of other grammatical in-formation is, on the contrary, to be resolved in prag-matic level because some extra-linguistic knowledgeis required.
Consequently, we concentrate in this pa-per the resolution of gapping by means of syntax andsemantics.Many proposals to gap resolution were intro-duced, but we classify them into two groups: non-ellipsis-based and ellipsis-based.
Non-ellipsis-basedapproach is characterized by: (a) strong proof sys-tem (Lambek, 1958), and (b) functional compositionand type raising that allow coordination of incom-plete constituents, such as CG (Ajdukiewicz, 1935;Bar-Hillel, 1953; Moortgat, 2002), CCG (Steed-man, 2000), and multimodal CCG (Baldridge andKruijff, 2003).
Proposals in this approach, suchas (Hendriks, 1995; Ja?ger, 1998a; Ja?ger, 1998b),introduced specialized operators to resolve overtanaphora, while covert anaphora is left unsolved.Ellipsis-based approach is characterized by treat-ing incomplete constituents as if they are of thesame simple type but contain ellipsis inside (Yatabe,2002; Cryssmann, 2003; Beavers and Sag, 2004).However, Beavers and Sag (2004) evidenced thatellipsis-based analysis possibly reduces the accept-ability of language, because the resolution is per secompletely uncontrolled.In this paper, we introduce an integration of thetwo approaches that incorporates strong proof sys-tem and ellipsis-based analysis.
Antecedent memo-rization and gap induction are introduced to imitateellipsis-based analysis.
The directions of ellipsis are80also used to improve the acceptability of language.The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
Sec-tion 2 describes the formalization of our method.Section 3 evidences the coverage of the frameworkon coping with the gapping issues in analytic lan-guages.
Section 4 further discusses coverage andlimitations of the framework comparing with CGand its descendants.
Section 5 explains relevanceof the proposed formalism to MT.
Finally, Section 6concludes the paper and lists up future work.2 Memory-Inductive Categorial GrammarMemory-Inductive Categorial Grammar, abbrevi-ated MICG, is a version of pure categorial grammarextended by ellipsis-based analysis.
On the con-trary, it relies on antecedent memorization, gap in-duction, and gap resolution that outperform CCG?sfunctional composition and type raising.All grammatical expressions of MICG are, likeCG, distinguished by a syntactic category identify-ing them as either a function from arguments of onetype to result another (a.k.a.
function), or an argu-ment (a.k.a.
primitive category).
Let us exemplifythe MICG by defining an example grammar G be-low.John,Mary,sandwich,noodle ?
npeats ?
(np\s)/npand ?
&The lexicons John, Mary, sandwich, and noodle are as-signed with a primitive category np.
The lexiconeats is assigned with a function that forms a sentences after taking np from the right side (/np) and thentaking np from the left side (np\).
The lexicon and isassigned with a conjunction category (&).
By meansof syntactic categories assigned to each lexicon, thederivation for a simple sentence ?John eats noodle?
isshown in (1).John eats noodleJohn ?
np eats ?
(np\s)/np noodle ?
npeats?noodle ?
np\sJohn ?
(eats?noodle) ?
s(1)CG suffers some patterns of coordination e.g.SVO&SO as exemplified in (2).John eats noodle, and Mary, sandwich.
(2)One should find that the second conjunct cannot bereduced into s by means of CG, because it lacks ofthe main verb ?eats.?
The main verb in the first con-junct should be remembered and then filled up tothe ellipsis of the second conjunct to accomplish thederivation.
This matter of fact motivated us to de-velop MICG by introducing to CG the process ofremembering an antecedent from a conjunct, calledmemorization, and filling up an ellipsis in the otherconjunct, called induction.
There are three manda-tory operations in MICG: antecedent memorization,gap induction, and gap resolution.One of two immediate formulae combined inthe derivation can be memorized as an antecedent.The resulted syntactic category is modalized by themodality 2DF , where D is a direction of memoriza-tion (< for the left side and > for the right side),and F is the memorized formula.
The syntacticstructure of the memorized formula is also modal-ized with the notation 2 to denote the memoriza-tion.
It is restricted in MICG that the memorized for-mula must be unmodalized to maintain mild context-sensitivity.
For example, let us consider the deriva-tion of the first conjunct of (2), ?John eats noodle,?with antecedent memorization at the verb ?eats?
in(3).
As seen, a modalized formula can combine withanother unmodalized formula while all modalitiesare preserved.John eats noodleJohn ?
np 2eats ?
(np\s)/np noodle ?
np2eats?noodle ?
2<eats?
(np\s)/np(np\s)John ?
(2eats?noodle) ?
2<eats?
(np\s)/nps(3)Any given formula can be induced for a missingformula, or a gap, at any direction, and the inducedgap contains a syntactic category that can be com-bined to that of the formula.
The resulted syntacticcategory of combining the formula and the gap ismodalized by the modality 3DF , where D is a direc-tion of induction, and F is the induced formula at thegap.
The syntactic structure of F is an uninstantiatedvariable and also modalized with the notation 3 todenote the induction.
The induced formula is neces-sary to be unmodalized for mild context-sensitivity.For example, let us consider the derivation of thesecond conjunct of (2), ?Mary, sandwich,?
with gap in-duction before the word ?sandwich?
in (4).
The vari-81able of syntactic structure will be resolved with anappropriate antecedent containing the same syntac-tic category in the gap resolution process.Mary sandwichMary ?
np sandwich ?
np3X ?
sandwich ?
3<X?
(np\s)/np(np\s)Mary ?
(3X ?
sandwich) ?
3<X?
(np\s)/nps(4)Gap resolution matches between memorized an-tecedents and induced gaps to associate ellipses totheir antecedents during derivation of coordinationand serialization.
That is, two syntactic categories2D1F1 C and 3D2F2 C are matched up and canceled fromthe resulted syntactic category, if they have the samesyntactic categories C, their directions D1 and D2are equal, and their memorized/induced formulae F1and F2 are unified.
For example, let us consider thederivation of ?John eats noodle, and Mary, sandwich?in Figure 1.
The modalities 2<eats?
(np\s)/nps and3<X?
(np\s)/nps are matched up together.
Their mem-orized/induced formulae are also unified by instan-tiating the variable X with ?eats?.
Eventually, af-ter combining them and the conjunction ?and,?
thederivation yields out the formula (John ?
(2eats ?noodle))?
(and?
(Mary?
(3eats?
sandwich))) ?
s.Gap resolution could also indicate argument shar-ing in coordination and serialization.
3D1F1 C and3D2F2 C can be also matched up, if they have the samesyntactic categories C, their directions D1 and D2are equal, and their memorized/induced formulae F1and F2 are unified.
However, they must be preservedin the resulted syntactic category.
For example, letus consider the derivation in Figure 2.
By means ofunification of induced formulae, the variables X andY are unified into the variable Z.A formal definition of MICG is given in Ap-pendix A. MICG is applied to resolve deletion undercoordination and serialization in analytic languagesin the next section.3 Gap Resolution in Analytic LanguagesThere are two causes of gapping in analytic lan-guages: coordination and serial verb construction.Each of which complicates the analysis module ofMT to resolve such issue before transferring.
In thissection, problematic gapping patterns are analyzedin forms of generalized patterns by MICG.
For sim-plification reason, syntactic structure is suppressedduring derivation.3.1 To resolve gapping under coordinationCoordination in analytic languages is more com-plex than that of Indo-European ones.
Multi-conjunct coordination is suppressed here becausebiconjunct coordination can be applied.
BesidesSVO&VO and SV&SVO patterns already resolvedby CCG (Steedman, 2000), there are also SVO&SV,SVO&V, SVO&SO (already illustrated in Figure 1),and SVO&SA patterns.The pattern SVO&SV exhibits ellipsis at the ob-ject position of the second conjunct.
The analysis ofSVO&SV is illustrated in (5).
It shows that the ob-ject of the first conjunct is memorized while the verbof the second conjunct is induced for the object.S V O & S Vnp (np\s)/np np & np (np\s)/np2>np(np\s) 3>np(np\s)2>nps 3>npss(5)Analysis of the sentence pattern SVO&V, illus-trated in (6), exhibits ellipses at the subject and theobject positions of the second conjunct.
The subjectand the object of the first conjunct are memorized,while the verb of the second conjunct is inducedtwice for the object and for the subject, respectively.S V O & Vnp (np\s)/np np & (np\s)/np2>np(np\s) 3>np(np\s)2<np2>nps 3<np3>npss(6)The pattern SVO&SA exhibits ellipsis at the pred-icate position of the second conjunct, because onlythe adverb (A) is left.
Suppose the adverb, typed(np\s)/(np\s), precedes the predicate.
Illustrated in(7), the predicate of the first conjunct is memorized,while the adverb of the second conjunct is inductedfor the predicate.S V O & S Anp (np\s)/np np & np (np\s)/(np\s)np\s 3>np\s(np\s)2>np\ss 3>np\sss(7)82John eats noodle and Mary, sandwichJohn?

Usually, theverbs have a single structural object and share log-ical arguments (Baker, 1989).
Following (Li andThompson, 1981; Wang, 2007; Thepkanjana, 2006),we classify SVC into three main types: consecu-tive/concurrent events, purpose, and circumstance.No operation specialized for tracing antecedentprojection in consecutive/concurrent event construc-tion has been proposed in CG or its descendants.
InMICG, the serialization operation is specialized forthis construction.
For example, a Chinese sentencefrom (Wang, 2007) in (8) is analyzed as in (9).ta?
ma?i pia`o j?
?n qu`he buy ticket enter go?He buys a ticket and then goes inside.?(8)ta?
ma?i pia`o j?
?n qu`np (np\s)/np np np\s np\snp\s 3<nps 3<nps2<nps 3<npss(9)Illustrated in (9), the subject argument ta?
?he?
is pro-jected through the verb sequence by means of mem-orization and induction modalities.Purpose construction can also be handled byMICG.
For example, a Thai sentence in (10) is ana-lyzed as in (11).kha?V tO`: thO?
: paj Cha?j naj ba?
:nhe attach pipe go use in house?He attaches pipes to use in the house.?
(10)kha?V tO`: thO?

thesubject kha?V ?he?
and the object thO?
: ?pipe,?
are pro-jected through the construction.SVC expressing circumstance of action is syntac-tically considered much as consecutive event con-struction.
For example, a Chinese sentence from(Wang, 2007) in (12) is analyzed as in (13).wo?
yo`ng kua`izi ch??
fa`nI use chopstick eat meal?I eat meal with chopsticks.?(12)wo?

Controlled by order and di-rection, each memorized constituent is guaranteedto be cross-serially associated to its correspondinginduced gap, while each gap pair is also cross-serially associated revealing argument sharing.
Thiscauses cross-serial association, illustrated in Fig-ure 3, among memorized constituents and inducedgaps.
Since paired modalities are either eliminatedor preserved and no modalities are left on the start83symbol, it guarantees that there is eventually nomodality in derivation.
In conclusion, no excessivegap is over-generated in the language.p1 q1 p2 q2 .

Noderaising is analyzed in terms of MICG by memorizingthe raised constituent at the conjunct it occurs andinducing a gap at the other conjunct.
For example,the right node ?ice cream?
is raised in the sentence ?Ilike but you don?t like ice cream.?
The sentence canbe analyzed in terms of MICG in (14).I like but you don?t like ice creamnp (np\s)/np & np (np\s)/np np3>np(np\s) 2>np(np\s)3>nps 2>npss(14)Topicalization and contraposition are still the is-sues to be concerned for coverage over CCG.
Forexample, in an example sentence ?Bagels, Yo saidthat Jan likes?
from (Beavers and Sag, 2004), theNP ?Bagels?
is topicalized from the object positionof the relative clause?s complement.
(15) shows un-parsability of the sentence.Bagels, Yo said that Jan likesnp np (np\s)/cl cl/s np (np\s)/np3>np(np\s)3>nps3>nps3>np(np\s)3>nps?????
(15)Furthermore, constituent shifting, such as dativeshift and adjunct shift, is not supported by MICG.We found that it is also constituent extraction asconsecutive constituents other than the shifted oneare extracted from the sentence.
For example, theadjunct ?skillfully?
is shifted next to the main verbin the sentence ?Kahn blocked skillfully a powerfulshot by Ronaldo?
from (Baldridge, 2002) in (16).a powerful shotKahn blocked skillfully by Ronaldonp (np\s)/np (np\s)\(np\s) np3>np(np\s)3>np(np\s)3>nps?????
(16)Since MICG was inspired by reasons other thanthose of CCG, the coverage of MICG is thereforedifferent from CCG.
Let us compare CG, CCG, andMICG in Table 1.
CCG initially attempted to han-dle linguistic phenomena in English and other Indo-European languages, in which topicalization and da-tive shift play an important role.
Applied to manyother languages such as German, Dutch, Japanese,and Turkish, CCG is still unsuitable for analytic lan-guages.
MICG instead was inspired by deletion un-der coordination and serial verb construction in ana-lytic languages.
We are in progress to develop an ex-tension of MICG that allows topicalization and da-tive shift avoiding combinatoric explosion.5 Relevance to RBMTMajor issues of MT from analytic languages intoIndo-European ones include three issues: anaphorageneration, semantic duplication, and sentencestructuring.
Both syntax and semantics are used tosolve such problems by MICG?s capability of gapresolution.
Case studies from our RBMT are exem-plified for better understanding.Our Thai-English MT system is rule-based andconsists of three modules: analysis, transfer, andgeneration.
MICG is used to tackle sentences withdeletion under coordination and SVC which cannotbe parsed by ordinary parsers.
For good speed effi-ciency, an MICG parser was implemented in GLR-based approach and used to analyze the syntacticstructure of a given sentence before transferring.The parser detects zero anaphora and resolves theirantecedents in coordinate structure, and reveals ar-gument sharing in SVC.
Therefore, coordinate struc-ture and SVC can be properly translated.No experiment has been done on our system yet,but we hope to see an improvement of translationquality.
We planned to evaluate the translation accu-racy by using both statistical and human methods.84Table 1: Coverage comparison among CG, CCG, and MICG (Y = supported, N = not supported)Linguistic phenomena CG CCG MICGBasic application Y Y YNode raising N Y YTopicalization/contraposition N Y NConstituent shifting N Y NDeletion under coordination N N YSerial verb construction N N Y5.1 Translation of deletion under coordinationCoordinate structures in Thai drastically differ fromthose of English.
This is because Thai allows zeroanaphora at subject and object positions while En-glish does not.
Pronouns and VP ellipses must there-fore be generated in place of deletion under coordi-nation for grammaticality of English.
Moreover, se-mantic duplication is often made use to emphasizethe meaning of sentence, but its direct translation be-comes redundant.MICG helps us detect zero anaphora and resolvetheir antecedents, so that appropriate pronouns andellipses can be generated at the right positions.
Bytracing resolved antecedents and ellipses, argumentprojections are disclosed and they can be used tocontrol verb fusion.
We exemplify three cases oftranslation of coordinate structure.Case 1: Pronouns are generated to maintaingrammaticality of English translation if the twoverbs are not postulated in the verb-fusion table.
Forexample, a Thai sentence in (17) is translated, whilepronouns ?he?
and ?it?
are generated from Thai NPsna?k;rian ?student?
and kha`;no?m ?candy,?
respectively.na?k;rianS sW?
:V kha`;no?mO lE?
:V& kinVstudent buy candy then eat?A student buys candy, then he eats it.?
(17)Case 2: Two verbs V1 and V2 are fused togeth-erif they are postulated in the verb-fusion table toeliminate semantic duplication in English transla-tion.
The object form of S2 is necessary to be gener-ated in some cases.
For example, in (18), the trans-lation becomes ?He reports her this matter?
insteadof ?He tells her to know this matter.?
Two verbs bO`:k?tell?
and sa?
:b ?know?
are fused into a single verb ?re-port.?
The object form of ?she,?
?her,?
is also gener-ated.kha?VS bO`:kV ha?j& th@:S sa?
:pV rW?
:@N n??
:Ohe tell TO she know this matter?He reports her this matter.?
(18)Case 3: A VP ellipsis is generated to main-tain English grammaticality.
For example, in (19),a VP ellipsis ?do?
is generated from a Thai VPma?i ChO?
:b don;tri: rO?k ?not like rock music.
?CO:nS ChO?
:pV don;tri: rO?kO tE`:& Cha?nS ma?iAJohn like rock music but I not?John likes rock music, but I do not.?
(19)5.2 Translation of SVCSentence structuring is also nontrivial for translationof Thai SVC.
Thai uses SVC to describe consecu-tive/concurrent events, purposes, and circumstances.On the other hand, English describes each of thosewith different sentence structure.
A series of verbswith duplicated semantics can be also clustered toemphasize the meaning of sentence in Thai, whileEnglish does not allow this phenomenon.Because MICG reveals argument sharing in SVC,appropriate sentence structures can be selected bytracing argument sharing between two consecutiveverbs.
We exemplify two cases of translation ofSVC.Case 1: The second verb is participialized if thefirst verb is intransitive and its semantic concept isan action.
For example, the present participial formof the verb ?see,?
?seeing,?
is generated in (20) .so?m;Cha:jS d@:nV ChomV pha?
:p;khia?nOSomchai walk see paintings?Somchai walks seeing paintings.?
(20)Case 2: If the two cases above do not apply tothe two verbs, they are translated directly by de-fault.
The conjunction ?and?
is automatically added85to conjoin two verb phrases.
In case of multiple-conjunct coordination, the conjunction will be addedonly before the last conjunct.
For example, in (21),a pronoun ?it?
is generated from the NP kho?
:k ?coke,?while the conjunction ?and?
is automatically added.ph?i:;sa?
:VS sW?
:V kho?
:kO dW`:mVmy elder sister buy coke drink?My elder sister buys coke and drinks it.?
(21)6 Conclusion and Future WorkThis paper presents Memory-Inductive CategorialGrammar (MICG), an extended version of catego-rial grammar, for gap resolution in analytic languagetranslation.
Antecedent memorization, gap induc-tion, and gap resolution, are proposed to cope withdeletion under coordination and serial verb construc-tion.
By means of MICG, anaphora can be gen-erated for deletion under coordination, while sen-tence structure can be properly selected for serialverb construction.
No experiment has been done toshow improvement of translation quality by MICG.The following future work remains.
First, we willexperiment on our Thai-English RBMT to measureimprovement of translation quality.
Second, crite-ria for pronominal reference generation in place ofdeletion under coordination will be studied.
Third,once serial verb construction is analyzed, criteria ofsentence structuring will further be studied based onan analysis of antecedent projection.
Fourth and fi-nally, constituent extraction and the use of extractiondirection in the extraction resolution will be studiedto avoid combinatoric explosion.ReferencesK.

0.Proof Let us prove this property by mathematical induction.Basic step: Let l = 0.
We obtain that w0 = p1.
Since there isno unpaired substring, this case is trivially proven.Hypothesis: Let l = k. Suppose that wk =p1q1 .

p j(k)q j(k) p j(k)+1.
We rewrite wk = w1kw2k , where w1k =p1q1 .

Let the formulae of the substringswk+1 = w1k+1w2k+1 be t1k+1 ?

m2M2, respec-tively.
We can rewrite the substrings wk+1 = w1k+1w2k+1 in termsof wk = w1kw2k in three cases.Case I: Suppose w1k+1 = pqw1k .
It follows that the directionof q is <.
Since w1k+1 combines w2k+1, we can conclude thatw2k+1 = p?q?w2k .
Therefore, q and q?
are also associated by ?.Case II: Suppose w1k+1 = w1kqp.
It follows that the directionof q is >.
Since w1k+1 combines w2k+1, we can conclude thatw2k+1 = w2kq?p?.
Therefore, q and q?
are also associated by ?.Case III: w1k+1 = p1q1 .

Therefore, q and q?
are also associated by ?.From Case I, Case II, and Case III, we can rewrite w1k+1 =p?1q?1 p?2q?2 .

p?k+1 and w2k+1 = p?j(1)q?j(1) p?j(2)q?j(2) .
