?ekSchool of Global Japanese Studies,Meiji University,Nakano, Japanbor.hodoscek@gmail.comAbstractRegarding the construction of an ontology of Japanese lexical properties (JLP-O) as fundamental interms of establishing a conceptual framework to guide and facilitate the construction of a large-scalelexical resource (LR) database of the Japanese lexicon, this paper primarily focuses on two majorconcerns for the construction of the JLP-O.
The first is to map out and appropriately structure thenumerous lexical and psycholinguistic properties, or variables, associated with the Japanese lexicon.The second concern is to specify an appropriate range of lexical entries classes within the JLP-O.Both concerns have far-reaching implications for effectively capturing the rich patterns of intercon-nections among lexical entries and lexical properties and thus for realizing a multifunctional LR.After discussing the solutions integrated into the current Resource Description Framework (RDF)representation of the JLP-O, the paper also briefly describes the extraction of a corpus-based lexiconfrom the recently released Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ; Maekawaet al., 2013), an authoritative sampling of the contemporary Japanese lexicon.
Categorized accordingto the JLP-O?s range of lexical entry classes, and supplemented with orthographic variant and decom-position information, the BCCWJ-based lexicon represents a key reference LR for constructing thelarge-scale LR.1 IntroductionThe overarching objective of our research project is to construct a large-scale lexical resource (LR) ofJapanese lexical properties?interpreted inclusively as any characteristic or variable associated with words?which, as a comprehensivemodel of the Japanese lexicon, can potentially be beneficial for various researcherswithin the linguistic and cognitive sciences.
Within that larger endeavor, we regard the task of constructingan ontology of Japanese lexical properties (JLP-O) as being absolutely foundational for two important rea-sons.
The first is primarily pragmatic in nature.
As reflected in the relatively recent trend towards mergingLRs and ontologies (Huang et al., 2010; Oltramari et al., 2013), the formal specification of the ontology canunquestionably provide considerable advantages in terms of enhanced compatibility with natural languageprocessing (NLP) and knowledge system tools for efficiently integrating data, checking for consistency, andrealizing powerful query functionality.
In contrast, however, the second reason is both more conceptual andmore skeptical in nature.
In many ways, ontology construction can be thought of as the very epitome of aca-demic endeavor in seeking to clearly elucidate the phenomenon of interest, but it is also crucial to understandthat natural systems, such as language, do not necessarily conform to the standards of ontological complete-ness.
As outlined further in section 2, our approach to ontology construction particularly values the utility ofthe ontology as working conceptual framework.
Reflecting this, our approach attempts to strike a reasonablebalance between ontological rigor, on the one hand, and recognizing a number of other important cognitivecriteria, on the other hand, such as theoretical description, consistencies, psychological reality, and prefer-ences, in order to realize a core framework that can both guide the construction of the LR and, ultimately,facilitate multifunctional querying.Against that larger background, this paper specifically focuses on two major concerns addressed in con-structing the JLP-O.

The second major concern has been to specifyan appropriate range of lexical entries as core entities of the JLP-O for a highly agglutinative language likeJapanese.
As outlined in more detail in section 3, these concerns have direct implications for implementingeffective links among lexical entries and lexical properties.
In section 4, we explain how both concerns havebeen resolved within the JLP-O in ways that simultaneously help to represent the rich patterns of intercon-nectivity between various lexical properties and facilitate the realization of a multifunctional LR that bothpossesses powerful search capabilities and can be utilized by a wide range of users.
Section 4 also outlinesthe extraction and formal encoding of a major corpus-based lexicon essential for constructing the LR.
Section5 recaps the main points and briefly discusses future work for the larger LR project.2 Ontology as conceptual frameworkAfter some general comments about defining ontologies, this section also briefly introduces the two modelsfor LRs that we specifically draw inspiration from in constructing the JLP-O; namely, the lemon model(lexical model for ontologies; http://lemon-model.net/) and Spohr?s (2012) model for multifunctional LRs.2.1 General commentsAlthough Gruber?s (1993; 199) immensely influential pronouncement that an ?ontology is an explicit specifi-cation of a conceptualization?
continues to provide the basic template, following Guarino (1998) and Guarinoet al.
(2009), many subsequent definitions of ontologies tend to also emphasize the shared nature of the con-ceptualization (Guarino et al., 2009; Pr?vot et al., 2010).
The elements of this ontology definition require alittle unpacking.
First, conceptualization refers to both the explicit and implicit knowledge about a systemor entity, such as its component entities and their relations.
Next, explicit, or formal, specification refers toa commitment to encode the body of knowledge in the form of some representation language, usually in amachine-readable format.
And, finally, shared conceptualization refers to the criterion that, to have value,there should be a general consensus among interested parties about the target conceptualization (Guarino etal., 2009; Pr?vot et al., 2010).As already suggested, our approach towards ontology construction is admittedly somewhat nuanced innature, reflecting a basic tension at the conceptual level.
While we fully concur with the laudable drive to-wards clearer descriptions of phenomena that ontology construction entails, we are equally cautious of seeingontologies alone as some magical panacea for all knowledge representation problems.
The sentiment is par-ticularly visceral in the case of natural systems like language which abounds in various forms of redundancyand biases that are not readily represented by ontologies.
Thus, in our efforts to construct a comprehensivemodel of the Japanese lexicon, we are endeavoring to incorporate vital aspects of linguistic and cognitiveknowledge that are embedded within its diverse lexical properties.
However, at the pragmatic level, weacutely recognize the numerous benefits of adopting the ontology as a conceptual framework for effectivelyrealizing the overall research objective of constructing a large-scale LR database of Japanese lexical proper-ties.
In some ways, our qualified position on ontology construction is rather aptly captured in the followingcomments from Franconi, Kerhet, and Ngo (2013):An ontology provides a conceptual view of the database and it is composed by constraints on avocabulary extending the basic vocabulary of the data.
Querying a database using the terms in sucha richer ontology allows for more flexibility than using only the basic vocabulary of the relationaldatabase directly.2.2 Models for linguistic resourcesFor the sake of clarity (albeit at some risk of possibly overstating what may already be sufficiently obvi-ous), our primary objective in constructing the JLP-O is to have a conceptual view, or framework, to aid thedevelopment of a large-scale LR database with multifunctional querying capabilities, which we hope willcome to serve as a comprehensive model of the Japanese lexicon.
That is to say, we are seeking to apply175linguistic, psycholinguistic and cognitive conceptualizations about Japanese words in order to realize a for-mal specification of the Japanese lexicon.
This naturally brings into focus the next vital piece in the puzzle;namely, the need for an ontology model that is particularly suitable for linguistic resources, where linguisticand psycholinguistic conceptualizations (lexical properties) are linked to the lexical entries (words) of thedatabase.
Although a number of candidate models exist, such as LexInfo (Cimiano, Buitelaar, McCrae, &Sintek, 2011), LIR (Linguistic Information Repository; Peters, Montiel-Ponsoda, & Cea, 2007) and LMF(Lexical Markup Framework; Francopoulo, 2013), the present work draws inspiration most directly from thelemon model and Spohr?s (2012) model for multifunctional LRs.Building directly on the LexInfo, LIR and LMF models, lemon has been specifically developed to be astandard for the exchange of lexical information on the semantic web, and so it has a number of advantagesthat are particularly appealing for JLP-O.
These include the facts that lemon is based on RDF, a semantic webstandard that can greatly facilitate the representation of links between parts of the LR, and that, reflecting itspolicy not to prescribe over linguistics definitions, lemon effectively delegates the burdens of constrainingdomain-specific information to external sources, such as WordNet and ontologies of linguistic descriptionssuch as GOLD (General Ontology for Linguistic Description; http://linguistics-ontology.org/).
Other advan-tages are that lemon is relatively concise, because it requires few classes and relies on external definitions,and that it is organized in terms of a number of separate modules, which can be constructed independentlyfor greater flexibility.
In contrast, reflecting its emergence from the intersection between semantic web tech-nology and lexicography, Spohr?s (2012) model for multifunctional LRs is particularly concerned with theinformational needs of diverse users, encompassing both humans (from monolinguals, bilinguals, novices,to linguistic experts) and NLP applications, and with realizing suitable query and display interfaces.
As thegoal of achieving a high degree of multifunctionality, in Spohr?s sense of the notion, is also central to our LRproject, we particularly take to heart Spohr?s suggestion that one vital key for realizing multifunctionality isthe incorporation of an appropriate typology, or range, of lexical entries.3 Construction concernsThis section briefly sketches out the twomajor issues for constructing the JLP-O; namely, appropriately struc-turing the wide range of lexical properties associated with the Japanese lexicon and determining a suitablerange of lexical entries.
The solutions incorporated into JLP-O?s RDF representation are discussed further insection 4.3.1 Range of Japanese lexical propertiesFor researchers within the language and cognitive sciences to be able conduct significant research on variousaspects of the Japanese language, such as developing more robust models and simulations of linguistic andcognitive abilities, obviously, access to a wide range of information about the contemporary Japanese lexiconis absolutely essential.
Traditionally, available LRs have been limited to various kinds of dictionaries, such aslanguage dictionaries like Shinmura?s (2008) K?jien and Kindaiichi et al.
?s (2011) Shinmeikai Kokugojitenand character dictionaries like Morohashi?s (2000) Daikanwajiten.
However, as dictionaries rarely providemuch summary information beyond headword counts, researchers have also had to rely on scarce sources ofdata summaries.
Hayashi?s (1982) Z?setsu Nihongo is a classic example that included a lexical section, withsome frequency, word class and formation information, an orthographic section, with some counts, usage andreadings information for kanji in particular, as well as sections on phonology and accent, grammar, and style.Setting aside genuine issues for keeping such data up-to-date, however, a particularly serious problem is thetremendous expansion in the range of lexical properties that researchers require data about today.
One helpfulway to understand the variety of lexical properties is in terms of Nation?s (2001/2013) aspects of knowing aword.
Highly influential in the areas of vocabulary research and second language acquisition, his frameworkconsists of nine broad types of word knowledge grouped under threemain categories of form (spoken, written,and word parts), meaning (form and meaning, concept and referent, and associations) and use (grammaticalfunctions, collocations, and constraints on use (such as register and frequency)).
In addition to the breadthdimension, it is also useful to think about the considerable range of lexical properties in terms of the depths ofanalyses conducted within these various domains.
For instance, taking just the domain of visual word recog-176nition experiments to illustrate, Adelman (2012) recently notes 14 kinds of potentially confounding lexicalvariables that should be controlled for, including frequency and contextual diversity data, various forms ofneighborhoods (orthographic, phonological, phonographic, and Levenshtein-distance), spelling-sound regu-larities and consistencies, length, morphological properties as well as rating-based measures.
While grantingthat some of these form-related lexical properties will undoubtedly also be of interest to researchers in otherareas, still, equally undeniably, they will also require information about many other lexical properties, suchas semantic properties of denotation and semantic groups of thesauri, or usage information, such as valencies,collocations and associations, and educational levels.In addition to facilitating the integration and ongoing maintenance of the large-scale LR, we see the con-struction of the JLP-O as being especially valuable for helping to elucidate divergent interpretations aboutlexical properties.
For instance, regardless of the markedly different theoretical motivations underlying or-thographic neighborhoods and morphological families, LRs of kanji compound neighborhoods and LRs ofmorphological families yield identical data, at least, with respect to the possible two-compound word combi-nations for a given set of kanji.
Awareness of such data equivalencies despite contrasting ontological perspec-tives is vital both for realizing robust queries of the LR and, in turn, for developing more robust simulationsand models.3.2 UniDic?s short-unit wordsFor a research project aiming to construct a large-scale LR that can serve as a comprehensive model of theJapanese lexicon, one of the thorniest issues that must be addressed is surely just what to treat as the coreentities within the LR database in the case of a highly agglutinative language like Japanese where wordboundaries are often ambiguous.
While doubting that an ideal solution exists, given that any decision iscertain to have broad implications for implementing a LR, the issue must be taken seriously.In this context, it is illustrative to look at UniDic; the electronic morphological dictionary for the Japaneselanguage that was developed as part of the BCCWJ project.
Reflecting its objectives to be a high-performancedictionary for wide coverage of contemporary written Japanese, UniDic adopted as its prime entity the so-called short-unit word (SUW), which roughly corresponds to the shortest meaningful unit, the morpheme.However, although that decision is certainly not without some justification, as Joyce, Hodo?
?ek and Nishina(2012) discuss, it is also fair to say that the SUW is far from convenient for human users, unless additional in-formation about higher-order groupings is also readily available.
Although the BCCWJ project?s provision ofsupplementary information in the form of annotations about so-called long-unit words (LUWs)?groupingsof verb and adjective agglutinations and compound nouns as single units?probably originates from this is-sue, still, the distinction is somewhat artificial and requires a certain degree of familiarity.

/h?kokusho o yomihajimeru/ ?to begin reading a report (document)?.177While again acknowledging that any proposals about what to treat as core lexical entries within a LR ofthe Japanese lexicon are likely to involve some degree of compromise, still one obvious lesson to emergefrom referring to the UniDic case is that a single lexical unit alone is insufficient in order to handle all itemsof the Japanese lexicon adequately for all kinds of users.
As outlined further in section 4.2, our solution forJLP-O is to specify a wider range of lexical entries.
However, despite the problems of SUWs and LUWsassociated with the BCCWJ, it is an authoritative sampling of the contemporary Japanese lexicon, consistingof approximately 100 million words.
Accordingly, it unquestionably remains the most valuable source fromwhich to extract a corpus-based lexicon, with information about numerous core lexical properties, includinglemma and orthographic specification, their respective frequencies, their phonological information and wordclasses, to establish a solid foundation to the construction of the large-scale LR project.4 JLP-O constructionHaving touched on the extensive range of Japanese lexical properties and the inherent tensions involved inselecting a range of lexical entry classes, this section turns to explain how these concerns have been handledin constructing the current version of the JLP-O.
The section also outlines the extraction of the BCCWJ-basedlexicon and the assignment of JLP-O?s LexicalEntry subclasses as a foundation for the LR.4.1 JLP-O modulesAlthough a number of separate Japanese LRs have already been created to address various lexical properties,given that they have been developed with different objectives and with diverging interpretations about thelexical properties themselves, their treatments of key properties, such as phonological, orthographic or se-mantic information, are not always consistent across resources, which can also vary greatly in terms of theirlevels of coverage.
In order to help remedy this situation, the overall aim of our research project is to createa single comprehensive LR by constructing the JLP-O as its core framework to facilitate the integration ofexisting LRs.Some of the initial groundwork for the LR project is outlined by Joyce, Masuda, and Ogawa (2014), withinthe context of discussing the revised j?y?
kanji list as the core building block of the Japanese writing system.In addition to identifying and organizing a number of lexical properties at the j?y?
kanji character level, theyalso describe a new analysis of the components of j?y?
and JIS1 kanji, and apply an initial orthographic codingto the corpus word lists created in Joyce et al.
(2012).
Building directly from that, our continuing investiga-tions of lexical properties have already identified 65 important properties; although, naturally, we fully expectthe number to expand still further as additional LRs are consulted and examined for their particular merits.Reflecting both their natural mutual relationships and the need to structure their representations within theLR, these properties have also been organized under six modules of character, orthographic, phonological,morphological, semantic, and use.
These are presented in Table 1 with a few examples of the relevant lexicalproperties.Modules Example propertiesCharacter type, configuration, internal structure, stroke counts, status, references, ?Orthographic representation, variations, length (in characters), neighborhood data, ?Phonological stress, length (in mora), CV structures, homophones, neighborhoods, consistency, ?Morphological word structure, family data (size/frequency), constituent analysis, transparency, ?Semantic denotation, connotations, sense range, lexical stratum, groups, concreteness, relations,?Use frequency/familiarity data, collocations, grammatical patterns, genre/register/style, ?Table 1: The six modules of the JLP-O with examples of relevant lexical properties.This structuring of the lexical properties is highly consistent with lemon?s modular design, which includesfive modules in its core: linguistic description, variation, phrase structure, syntax and mapping, and mor-phology.
We are, therefore, able to utilize a great deal of lemon?s basic descriptive infrastructure pretty muchintact, albeit with some relabeling of module names and some element reallocations to conform to JLP-O?s178modularization of lexical properties.
For example, much of lemon?s syntax and mapping module could beused with only minimal label changes in the integration of LRs such as Japanese versions ofWordNet (Isaharaet al., 2012) and FrameNet (Ohara et al., 2004) to JLP-O?s semantic and use modules, respectively.
In con-trast, however, some basic characteristics of the Japanese lexicon, such as unit size issues and more extensivelevels of orthographic variation, necessitate more expressive alternatives to both lemon?s variation moduleand the decomposition property within the phrase structure module.
Given these clear parallels, however, webelieve that lemon?s notion of modules is the most effective approach to structuring the lexical properties andto realizing their complex mappings to the range of lexical entries within our LR.4.2 JLP-O?s core range of lexical entriesAs noted in subsection 3.2, one of the thorniest concerns to address in constructing a large-scale LR of theJapanese lexicon is to determine a suitable range of lexical entries to use as the core entities of the database.The issue is certainly far from straightforward, because it involves finding a workable compromise betweena set of conflicting constraints.
Naturally, these include the highly agglutinative nature of the Japanese lan-guage itself, which, understandably, encourages a focus towards the smallest components.
However, theseconstraints also include the needs of diverse users of the LR, where, in contrast, as Spohr (2012) convincinglyargues, a wider range is preferable for enhancing the search capabilities of an LR.
At its heart, however, theissue is primarily about representation, or formal specification, given that the complex relationships betweenlexical entries themselves and between lexical entries and themodules of lexical properties must be efficientlycaptured within the JLP-O.However, on consulting with our two reference models for LRs for guidance, we discover that theyadopt radically different approaches to the specification of lexical entries.
Consistent with its aspirationsto be concise, lemon specifies just three classes of lexical entries; namely, Part, Word and Phrase.While this rather minimalist level of specification is, arguably, not so dissimilar to the de facto distinc-tion that emerges with UniDic between SUWs and LUWs, comparisons quickly break down on closer in-spection.
For example, SUWs cover both bound morphemes (affixes and particles) and free morphemes(simple words), but these would correspond to lemon?s part and word classes, respectively.
The LUW con-cept also fails to fit nicely with lemon?s tripartite division.
Given that LUWs are either polymorphemicwords or compound words formed by combining SUWs, the unit does not extend to phrases which arenot marked by UniDic.
In sharp contrast, but also consistent with his goal of multifunctionality, Spohr?sMLR model incorporates a highly detailed typology of lexical entries (lexemes).
Although the upper-level division into BoundUnit, FreeUnit, and Clitic may not, at first glance, appear so different, thesubsequent divisions of BoundUnit into BoundStem and Affix (further divided into 9 kinds) and ofFreeUnit into Idiom, Syntactically-ComplexFreeUnit, and Syntactically-SimpleFreeUnit(of which the final two are further divided eventually into 17 and 11 subclasses, respectively) clearly demon-strate very different theoretical motivations and objectives.
That noted, however, the distinction betweenSyntactically-SimpleFreeUnit and Syntactically-ComplexFreeUnit parallels more closely tothe contrast between SUWs and LUWs.Aiming for a realistic balance between the constraints afforded by the characteristics of the Japanese lex-icon, the LR?s ambitions to realize a high degree of multifunctionality, and the need to achieve an accept-able degree of formal specification concerning the relationships among lexical entries and the six modulesof lexical properties, the solution that we adopt for JLP-O is closer in spirit to the upper-levels of Spohr?s(2012) typology of lexeme subclasses.
More specifically, as illustrated in Table 2, we specify for JLP-Ofive classes of LexicalEntry, which are Character, BoundUnit, SimpleWord, ComplexWord, andMultiWordExpression.
Thus, while the basic entities of the JLP-O draws inspiration more directly fromSpohr?s typology of lexeme classes, the range of JLP-O lexical entries has been increased in order to morefaithfully represent the nature of the Japanese lexicon.4.3 Extraction and RDF encoding of corpus lexiconHaving identified our practical solutions, this section briefly outlines their implementation in the RDF encod-ing.
First, the current version of the JLP-O was specified by extending lemon?s OWL specification using theProt?g?
ontology editor (http://protege.stanford.edu/).
Second, a program was executed to simultaneously179Lexical entry type Examples of units includedCharacter kanji (?

The first minor extension relates to the high levels of orthographic variation that exists withinthe Japanese lexicon, as evidenced in Joyce et al.
(2012), which is far beyond that envisioned by either lemonor Spohr?s models.
In seeking to be more consistent with UniDic?s basic distinction between an abstractlemma form and all orthographic variations of a Japanese word, we have somewhat expanded upon lemon?sdistinction between canonicalForm and otherForm, by retaining the first label for the lemma form andchanging the otherForm label to orthographicForm for each orthographic variant of a word.
The secondminor expansion is to more extensively utilize lemon?s decomposition object property (which in lemon islimited to specifying the decomposition of phrases into parts).
Thus, apart from the Character subclasswithin the current JLP-O (compositional analysis of radicals is not fully implemented at present), all lexicalentry classes have a decomposition object property; such that both BoundUnit and SimpleWord en-tries are decomposed into one or more Characters, while the orthographicForms of ComplexWord andMultiWordExpression entries are decomposed into the relevant orthographicForms of BoundUnitsand SimpleWords.
By adopting this approach to linking structures, it is possible to search for complex lexi-cal entries based on lower-level components, such as characters, by traversing the implemented hierarchicalstructure.
Figure 2 shows a part of the lexical model with a focus on the lexical entries.In order to extract the corpus lexicon, a program was written to convert the SUW and LUW infor-mation from the BCCWJ corpus into the JLP-O?s RDF format, including the appropriate assignment ofLexicalEntry subclasses.
The M-XML format of the BCCWJ (version 1) includes basic structural en-codings of LUWs in the form of lists of component SUWs.
First, SUWs were assigned as either BoundUnitor SimpleWord lexical entries based on their unique identifier, which consists of the unique combinationof the lemma and the POS category.
Next, all orthographic variations of the lexical entry (based on theirshared identifier) were recorded within the single entry specification using the orthographicForm objectproperty, together with their decompositions into lists of characters.
Finally, the frequency counts for or-thographic variants were recorded using the use object property, allowing us to specify frequency countstogether with their sources, which in the present case is a corpus identifier but could also specify a particulargenre or style.
The total frequency count, as sum of all orthographicForm variants, was also recordedunder the canonicalForm property.Figure 3 shows part of the RDF encoding in Turtle format for the SimpleWord lexical entry for the verb??
/yomu/ ?to read?.
For the sake of brevity, it is not possible to display all 12 orthographic variants, butthe figure includes the three most frequent; the standard kanji-kana mixed orthography (of verbal stem andinflectional ending), the hiragana-orthography representation of?

/hajimeru/ ?to begin?.
Interestingly, ???
is the verb2 element of many verb1-verb2compounds that express senses of ?to begin V1?.Finally, the extraction program also assigned LUWs to the ComplexWord subclass.
The process essentiallymirrored the extraction of BoundUnit or SimpleWord lexical entries, except that links under the decom-position object property link back to its constituent BoundUnit or SimpleWord lexical entries.

(verb2).We executed the extraction and RDF encoding program to enumerate the BCCWJ-based corpus lexiconaccording to the JLP-O?s core LexicalEntry classes.
As summarized in Table 3, approximately 2.7 millionlexical entries were assigned to the four core LexicalEntry classes.Lexical entry Types TokensCharacters 6,761 195,500,491BoundUnit 433 11,327,729SimpleWord 195,380 112,557,387ComplexWord 2,438,506 101,684,786Table 3: Type and token counts for the BCCWJ-based corpus lexicon.The number of lexical entries assigned to the Character subclass is highly consistent with encoding spec-ifications for Japanese characters.
Similarly, the relatively smaller number of BoundUnit lexical entries isalso consistent with the fact that this class consists of a small number of closed word classes, such as parti-cles and the relatively limited sets of affixes.
In contrast, the much higher counts for the SimpleWord andComplexWord classes obviously reflect in largemeasure the fact that these cover themajor openword classes,and, in particular, the noun class, which is extremely open.
Another closely related factor is that these lexicalentries also include vast numbers of proper nouns, which is a particular feature of large corpus data.
The sub-stantial difference between the SimpleWord and ComplexWord classes clearly illustrates the agglutinativenature of the Japanese language with rich verbal and adjectival conjugations and productive compounding.However, also a characteristic of large corpus data, it should also be noted that approximately 66% of theComplexWord lexical entries occur only once within the BCCWJ corpus.
And, a natural corollary is thatwhile the ComplexWord lexical entries are on average decomposed into 3.1 BoundUnit and SimpleWordlexical entries, 94% of these have only one orthographic variant (because, for extremely low frequency words,one obviously requires even larger corpora to capture all possible orthographic variations).
A final observa-tion to make is that the corpus lexicon does not yield any lexical entries under the MultiWordExpressionssubclass; although it would be feasible to extract collocational data from the BCCWJ, these will be identifiedfor the large-scale LR in the future in the course of integrating other LRs.5 ConclusionAs a principal component of a larger research project to construct a large-scale LR database concerned withthe lexical and psycholinguistic properties associated with the Japanese lexicon, the paper has described theconstruction of the ontology of Japanese lexical properties (JLP-O) as its working conceptual framework.More specifically, the paper focused on two important issues.
After outlining the first concern of mappingout and organizing the wide range of lexical and psycholinguistic properties that linguistic and cognitivescience researchers require up-to-date information about in section 3.1, section 4.1 detailed how these arebeing structured under six modules, which mirrors the flexible approach towards construction employedby lemon.
Similarly, after outlining the second difficult concern of what to treat as core entities of the LRdatabase in section 3.2, section 4.2 explained the reason behind our solution to recognize five LexicalEntryclasses, namely, that a wider range of classes is key to achieving the high degree of multifunctionality thatour LR project aspires to (Spohr, 2012).
Section 4.3 also outlined the extraction and RDF encoding of theBCCWJ-based corpus lexicon.
Classified according to the JLP-O?s range of lexical entries, and supplementedwith information about orthographic variations, decompositions and frequencies, the corpus lexicon providessolid foundations for the large-scale project to construct the comprehensive LR of Japanese lexical properties.Although we are fully aware that it will be necessary to further develop and refine the JLP-O as the largerLR project progresses, as the present working version has been constructed to specifically handle two fun-damental aspects about the Japanese lexicon, we believe that it represents a sufficiently robust conceptualframework that can guide future work of integrating existing LRs.
Thus, we approach the integration tasknot merely as a mechanical process of expanding the LR database by merging data, but as a dialectic one183that requires ongoing consideration and investigation of the theoretical adequacies and psychological reali-ties of candidate lexical properties; a reflective process that is exemplified by ontology construction.
And, asa working conceptual framework for examining the LR database, the JLP-O represents the kind of architec-tural blueprint of the structural relationships within the LR database that is essential for realizing high degreesof multifunctionality in terms of developing various interfaces for search queries and data presentation.
Inthis way, we hope to realize a comprehensive LR of Japanese lexical properties that will be beneficial as asystematic model of the Japanese lexicon that can be effectively mined in the pursuit of deeper insights intolexical knowledge.AcknowledgmentsThis research was partially supported by a JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Foreign Postdoctoral Fellows (no.
