It outlines the design and data formatof the samples as well as presenting various usage scenarios related to the applications featuredby the platform?s toolbox.1 IntroductionThis contribution presents the francophone corpus archive Corpus des vari?t?s nationales du fran?ais(CoVaNa-FR) and its hosting platform Varitext.The paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 will outline the rationale behind the corpus archive, itscomposition and its data format.
In section 3, we will then introduce the toolbox implemented by theVaritext platform, by illustrating some of its functionalities and giving brief sketches of correspondingusage scenarios.
Section 4 provides a brief summary and discusses possible directions for the futuredevelopment of the resources presented in this paper.2 The CoVaNa-FR corpus archive2.1 Rationale and composition of the CoVaNa-FRThe creation of the Corpus des vari?t?s nationales du fran?ais (CoVaNa-FR) is motivated by the aim ofoffering a large-scale resource to researchers working on the French language from a pluricentric per-spective.
It is thus primarily designed to provide methodological support for investigations in the Frenchtradition of ?lexicologie diff?rentielle?
(?variationist differential lexicography?)
focusing on elements ofendonormative differentiation, i.e.
the emergence of regionally specific norms compared to a supposedmetropolitan standard variety of French (for studies on various francophone regions, see R?zeau 2007,Thibault 2008; for studies especially focusing on Subsaharan Africa and the Maghreb, cf.
Queff?lec1997, Lafage 2002, Naffati and Queff?lec 2004, Nzesse 2009, to mention just a few examples of a si-zable body of literature).
Alongside the lexico-statistical toolbox implemented by the Varitext platform(cf.
Section 3 below), the design of the CoVaNa-FR goes beyond the rather conventional lexicographicrationale of the lexicological framework just mentioned and can be seen as a contribution to meetingthe desideratum, voiced by Stein (2003:14f), of carrying out large-scale investigations on Francophonevarieties using contemporary corpus linguistic methods.
In this regard, the CoVaNa-FR differs from exis-ting French corpora such as Frantext (cf.
ATILF-CNRS), Qu?b?text (cf.
Tr?sor de la langue fran?aise auQu?bec) and Suistext (cf.
Tr?sor des Vocabulaires francophones Neuch?tel) in offering broad regionalcoverage (bundling samples from Africa, Europe and North America), a wider range of query functiona-lities and free access (large parts of Frantext not being accessible free of charge and Suistext only beingavailable locally at its hosting institution, cf.
Thibault 2007:480).
Apart from corpus linguistic uses, theCoVaNa-FR could also be a valuable resource for research on the automatic classification of languagevarieties, which has recently aroused considerable interest in the field of NLP (for relevant contributi-ons see, amongst others, Ranaivo-Malancon 2006, Ljube?i?c et al.

It should be noted, though, that inaccordance with copyright restrictions, the CoVaNa-FR is not directly available for download and canonly be consulted via the GUI of the password-protected Varitext platform.Due to its focus on endonormative differentiation, the CoVaNa-FR is less balanced with respect togenre than similar corpora for other languages such as the International Corpus of English (ICE, cf.Greenbaum 1996), the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA, cf.
Davies 2009), the Cor-pus de Referencia del Espa?ol Actual (CREA, cf.
Real Academia Espa?ola), the Corpus del Espa?ol(cf.
Davies 2002) or the Corpus do Portugu?s (cf.
Davies 2014).1The initial version of the CoVaNa-FR,accessible on the Varitext platform, is made up of journalistic texts published by national newspapers indifferent Francophone countries in Africa, Europe and North America.
The choice of national newspa-pers as primary sources is based on the assumption made by Glessgen (2007:97) that these are parti-cularly representative of contemporary standard varieties (?les grands journaux [...] refl?tent assez bienles vari?t?s standard actuelles?).
Work is also underway on the extension of the CoVaNa-FR, such thatfuture versions will include a subcorpus of fiction and academic texts.
In its present state, the CoVaNa-FR is divided into 11 samples collected across a span of at least two years and categorized by regionalparameters as listed in Table 1.Sample code Country Sources Number ofword tokens2DZA Algeria El Watan, La Tribune d?Alger 45,600,000CAM Cameroon Cameroon Tribune, La Nouvelle Expression,Mutations46,500,000CAN Canada (Qu?bec) Le Devoir, Le Soleil 53,500,000COD Congo (D.R.C.)

1: Composition of the CoVaNa-FR (on-line version accessible via the Varitext platform).The compilation of the overall corpus archive outlined in Table 1 has been carried out according tothe requirement that each country be represented by a sample comprising at least two newspapers witharticles from the same (or similar) two years.
It should be noted, though, that some samples do notfully meet these guidelines, as is the case with the corpora representing Algeria and Canada (containingtwo newspapers from single and different years) or the sample representing the Democratic Republic ofCongo (containing three years of only one newspaper).2.2 Processing format of the CoVaNa-FRAll documents in the CoVaNa-FR corpus are formatted in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) with thestructural units (i) subcorpus, (ii) text, (iii) paragraph, and (iv) sentence.
The texts are annotated with(i) part-of-speech (PoS) tags, (ii) lemmas and (iii) dependency-parses using the commercially licensedConnexor annotation tool (Tapanainen and J?rvinen 1997).
The corpus files are in standard CWB in-put format (cf.
Evert and Hardie 2011:5f) with XML tags and each token record (one surface form +associated TAB-delimited token-level annotations) appearing on separate lines.The set of XML tagged structural units is specified by the DTD given in Figure 1.
Note that the toplevel <corpus>...</corpus> element defines one country related sample and that each subcorpus corre-sponds to a one year newspaper volume.
The element attributes which are provided inside the query1See the projects?

1: DTD specifying the structural elements of the country-related samples in the CoVaNa-FR corpus archive.As for the token rows, their core structure is basically defined according to the so-called CoNLLformat, introduced on the occasion of the correspondent 2007 shared task on dependency parsing (cf.Nivre et al.
2007:916).
For rather technical reasons, this structure has been extended by a numberof fields whose purpose is to optimize the processing of queries exploring the dependency relationsannotated in the corpus.
The fields in question are marked by an asterisk in the following table, whichoutlines the overall structure of the token records:Field name Descriptionid sentence internal numerical token identifier (counter starting at 1 for each sentence)word surface form or punctuation signlemma lemma corresponding to the surface formcpos coarse grained part of speech (PoS)pos fine grained PoS + morphological featuresheadid token identifier of the syntactic headheadoffset * distance between syntactic head and tokendeprel syntactic function of the token in the dependency relation to its headheadword * surface form of the syntactic headheadlemma * lemma of the syntactic headheadcpos * coarse grained PoS of the syntactic headheadpos * fine grained PoS + morphological features of the syntactic headpmarkword * surface form of the function word (adposition or conjunction) dependent on the token3pmarklemma * lemma of the function word dependent on the tokenpmarkcpos * PoS of the function word dependent on the tokenTab.
2: Structure of the token records contained by the corpus files.50The 11 country specific samples making up the present online version of the CoVaNa-FR (see Table 1above) have been encoded by means of the IMS Open Corpus Workbench (CWB, cf.
Evert and Hardie2011; see also the project?s web site http://cwb.sourceforge.net/), the total size of the cor-responding index files summing up to 58,4 GB of disk space.
The components of CWB are integratedas main query processing tools in the Varitext platform, which will be described in more detail in thefollowing section.3 The Varitext platform3.1 Design and GUIVaritext is a web-based platform (cf.
http://syrah.uni-koeln.de/varitext/ and http://extranet-ldi.univ-paris13.fr/varitext/) providing free-of-charge access to theCoVaNa-FR corpus archive presented in section 2.
As is indicated by its name, it is open to host corporafor other languages compiled according to the same rationale of large-scale variationist research in apluricentric perspective.
Work has already been completed on the prototype of a hispanophone corpusarchive, which will be released via Varitext in the near future.
There are also plans to compile similarresources for Portuguese, Russian and Arabic.The toolbox implemented by the Varitext platform is built upon three major software components:CWB for query processing, the UCS toolkit version 0.6 (cf.
Evert 2005, the software being available athttp://www.collocations.de/software.html) for cooccurrence analysis and R (R CoreTeam 2014) for statistical computing and plotting.The platform?s user interface allows fairly complex queries in terms of subsampling and the formula-tion of search expressions.
Using the menu options relating to the available metadata categories (such ascountry code, newspaper volume or thematic section), it is possible to create subcorpora and partitionswith different degrees of granularity, as is shown by Fig.
2:Fig.
2: Using menu options to build a partition defined by country on the basis of a subcorpus comprising the samples repre-senting Cameroon and the Ivory Coast and filtered by the thematic section ?Sports?As for the formulation of query expressions, the interface integrates a sub-menu to set up searchconstraints flexibly by combining several token properties (such as lemma, PoS or syntactic function;see the data model outlined in table 2 above) and / or assembling sequences of various length (see Figure3).3The annotation model of Connexor treats adpositions and conjunctions as markers dependent on content words (verbs,nouns, adjectives, adverbs).51Fig.

)In its present state, the Varitext platform features as its standard applications a KWIC concordancerand a set of tools for frequency computing, key word analysis and collocation processing, the latter ofwhich will be outlined in some detail below.
Future releases of the platform will also include advancedfunctionalities of statistical computing and plotting that are currently under development and testing andwhich will be briefly sketched at the end of this section.3.2 Usage Scenario: Sample Specific Frequencies and Lexical Differences3.2.1 chaussure vs. soulierOne of the platform?s standard applications besides KWIC concordancing is the computation of samplespecific frequencies and key word analysis.
In a corpus-based perspective, these methods can be used forinstance as diagnostics to test the results of ?differential?
lexicology.
Similar to Thibault?s (2007) studyon some lexical specificities of Canadian (Quebec), Swiss and metropolitan standard French, it would bepossible to analyze geographical lexical variants in terms of their frequency distribution.
An example alsomentioned by Thibault (2007:468-475) is provided by the nouns chaussure and soulier (?shoe?
), withsoulier being regarded as regional variant especially of Canadian French (cf.
the reference dictionary LePetit Robert (Rey-Debove and Rey 2006) s.v.
SOULIER).
A key word analysis based on the samplesrepresenting Canada/Quebec (geographical code: CAN), France (FRA) and Switzerland (CHE) yieldsthe log-likelihood ratio (LL) scores given by the following bar plots in Fig.
4 (for the use of the loglikelihood ratio in key word analysis see Rayson 2003).
The computation has been carried out on a 2x2basis, with one sample as the main corpus and the combination of the remaining two as the referencecorpus.Fig.
4: LL scores for the nouns chaussure and soulier in the samples representing Canada/Quebec, Switzerland and France52These figures indicate that there are clear-cut distributional divergences, with the two nouns beingrespectively under- and overrepresented in the samples related to Quebec and France.
This seems tosuggest that soulier is still part of the French standard as it evolves in Quebec, or at least in its nationalnewspapers, which qualifies to some extent the findings of Thibault (2007:474), according to whichQuebec newspaper language is moving towards greater conformity with French metropolitan usage inthe case of chaussure and soulier.
It should be noted that Thibault only considers the relative frequenciesof the two items within each national sample.
Applying this approach to our corpus data would provideno more than a confirmation of Thibault?s findings.
In light of the aforementioned key word analysis,though, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that, in Quebec French, the relationship between thetwo variants is rather more complex and should be subjected to a more detailed analysis in terms ofcollocational distribution.
One promising approach in this respect would be Hoey?s (2005) lexicalpriming theory.3.2.2 Quebec Specific Lexical ItemsAt this point, it is worth noting that, although major national newspapers might reflect trends of standardvarieties quite faithfully (see our reference to Glessgen 2007 in section 2), the data obtained from thesesources should be handled with some caution (cf.
also Thibault 2007:474).
This is of particular import-ance if we adopt a corpus-driven approach, which involves identifying the most characteristic features ina sample by means of statistical techniques such as key word analysis.This may be illustrated with the results of a key word analysis contrasting the Quebec subcorpus as awhole with the sample representing France.Lemma FrequencyCANFrequencyFRARel.

3: Words specific to the Quebec sub-corpus in contrast with the sample representing France.The data given in Table 3 show that the most specific items are proper nouns closely related to socio-cultural context, whereas words which clearly qualify as Quebecisms, such as chum (?friend, pal?
),magasiner (?to go shopping?
), placoter (?to chat?
; cf.
Poirier 1995:32) or paqueter (?to pack?
; cf.Poirier ibid) only come at lower ranks, their log-likelihood scores being nonetheless highly significant.3.3 Usage Scenario: Lexical Cooccurrences and Collocational VariationThe second main application provided by the platform?s toolbox is collocation analysis.
We will illustratethis functionality by considering the example of the causative support verb occasionner (?to occasionsth?)
and the semantic associations instantiated by its most significant collocates within each of the4Figures are given in terms of token per million.53samples making up the CoVaNa-Fr corpus archive.The following cross table which is based on the lexicogram (defined as list of collocates specified byassociation scores; see Tournier 1987) computed for occasionner displays some of the nouns in directobject position significantly collocating with this verb in terms of the log-likelihood ratio (the use ofthe latter as an association measure for collocation analysis having been proposed, amongst others, byDunning 1993).Collocate CAN5CHE CIV CMR COD DZA FRA MAR MLI SEN TUNaccident - - - 67.8 - 65.4 - - 61.2 - -accroissement - - - - 68.5 - - - - - -augmentation - - - - 52.4 - - - - - -baisse - - - - 41.7 - - - 59.5 - -co?t 90.3 - - - - - - - - - -d?g?t - 87.6 - 91.8 268.5 1059.3 62.3 255.7 157.6 208.5 143.9perte 298.8 109.4 267.8 178.0 208.8 381.4 64.9 134.1 492.9 170.5 129.7probl?me 62.37 - - - - 23.1 - - - - 33.1Tab.
4: Significant direct object noun collocates of occasionner across all the samples contained by the CoVaNa-FR.It is easy to see that the combinatorial profile of occasionner is essentially characterized by negativesemantic prosody throughout all the samples under investigation (for the concept of semantic prosody,see Stubbs 1995 and Xiao and McEnery 2006).
At the same time, however, it exhibits some degree ofregional variation; in the case of the sub-corpus representing the Congo (COD), for example, there isan additional semantic feature in evidence which may be described as INTENSITY (cf.
the collocatesaccroissement [?increase, growth?
], augmentation [?increase, rise?]
and baisse [?decrease, fall?
]).A similar statement can be made with regard to the significant noun collocates of causer (?to cause?
),although in this case it is the Quebec sample which adds more neutral marked elements (surprise [?sur-prise?])
to the overall picture.
We illustrate this by a means of a plot generated by a correspondenceanalysis (CA, see Lebart et al.
1998:47ff) performed on the sample specific lexicograms comprising thedirect object nouns significantly associated6with the verb in question (further examples of using CA toexplore the CoVaNa-FR are given by Diwersy and Loiseau forthcoming):Fig.
5: Plot generated by a CA performed on the country specific lexicograms of causer.5Sample name as translated to their corresponding ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes (see the UN Statistic Division?s pageat http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm).6The collocates used for further processing have been selected according to a frequency threshold of 20 and an LL scorethreshold of 10.83.54The CA plot7given in Fig.
5 highlights in its main (horizontal) dimension the contrast between theQuebec subcorpus and the remaining samples, this contrast being paralleled by the contrast between thenoun surprise and other items such as souci (?worry?)
and d?g?t (?damage?
).8Correspondence analysis is a useful technique in providing a condensed view of divergences relating tosamples and lexical items.
It will be included in the next release of the Varitext platform.4 ConclusionAs the examples in the preceding section have shown, there is considerable scope for using corpus-relatedtechniques (beyond concordancing) to investigate geographical variation from a pluricentric perspective,but researchers must exercise caution when working on the diverse sets of data which can be obtainedusing the resources outlined in this paper.
A major case in point is the composition of the corpus ar-chive and its current restriction to journalistic texts, which may bring about phenomena related to thesocio-cultural context rather than the linguistic one (although, from the point of view of media discourseanalysis and communication studies, these thematic ?side effects?
could be of quite some interest).It should be obvious, then, that our present activities focus on diversifying the corpus resources, espe-cially with regard to other written genres.
At the same time, we are engaged in extending the overalltext archive to include corpora for different languages, the rationale being to apply the methodologicalframework implemented by the Varitext platform to linguistic areas other than Francophonia.This framework is itself undergoing considerable modifications which will lead to the integration of ad-vanced statistical functionalities.
At present, our main interest is to enhance the platform?s toolbox byimplementing several exploratory multivariate techniques, which will be tested in experimental settingsthat, however, go beyond the narrow focus of this paper.That said, the development of the corpus archive and of the platform is still in its infancy, and is set toevolve further in various ways and directions.
At least, this is what should happen if the communitymakes good use of it.AcknowledgementsThe author wishes to thank the reviewers for their valuable comments which helped to clarify the mainpoints of the paper.ReferencesATILF-CNRS.
