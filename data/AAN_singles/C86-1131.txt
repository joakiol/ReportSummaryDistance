This paper describessome problems that are specific to our semantic basedapproach and some results of the evaluation study thathas been made by the Germanist group.I.
Generation procedure in SEMSYNThis section summarizes the SEMSYN genration procedure.Those readers who are more interested in the SEMSYNsystem are recommended to read our previous COLING84\[I\]paper or the paper submitted to this conference\[2\].
Thegeneration process begins with the conversion of the se-mantic networks, each represents one sentence, into aso-called IKBS (Instantiated Knowledge Base Schema.)
TheIKBS is an instantiation of case or concept schemata de-noted by semantic symbols as nodes in the semantic net-work.
A case schema contains three main descriptionslots; a) roles of cases associated with the seman-tic symbol, b) transformation rules of schemata,c) choice of German syntactic realization schemata.Being triggered by the semantic symbols of the givennetwork, IKBS specifies the best basic syntactic struc-ture associated with a German word by checking fillersof roles and converts them into functional roles withineach German syntactic ategory.
A German syntacto-mor-phological component called SUTRA-S\[3\] a extended ver-sion of SUTRA \[4\] generates German surface texts fromthe instantiated syntactic structure called IRS (Inst-antiaed, Realization Schemata.
)Though English-like terms are used for semantic symbols,the choice of a German word associated with each seman-tic symbol and its syntactic structure very differ fromthe  Eng l i sh  cor respond ing  one .It.
Some problems of semanitc based translation approachThere are some advantages as well as disadvantages ofthe semantic based approach, which we anticipated atthe beginning of the project.
Theoretically speaking,a reason why we adopted a semantic based approach againtthe syntactic transfer approach is founded on the cul-tural difference and communication barriers between thetwo project groups that cooperate with each other tobuild up a translation system.
Understanding the con-tent of the origenal sentence from the given semanticrepresentation the generation group could express it ina way that is common in its mother tangue, relativelyfree from the syntactic restriction and lexical corres-ponding terminology.
It is a well known fact that onelanguage of a culture can only be interpreted and notliterally be translated into the other languages of dif-ferent cultures, as it would be possible within thesame cultural sphere.
As the matter of fact we oftentook this advantage in our generation system.On the other hand, exactly this freedom turned out fre-quently to be a disadvantage on the generation side.Dealing with real data (titles of sientific papers inthe field of information technology from the Japanesedata base JOIS) we encountered new problems we didn'texpect before and recognized the limit of our approach.In the following we describe some of these problems:( l ~ i o n  ~ e s e  oriI~inal textWe had also to come up with this well known problem suchas lack of articles (definite or indefinite) and of dis-tinction between numbers (singular or plural.)
for nounsas well as verbs.
We embedded some heuristic rules inKBS and dictionary to add these syntactic features, ifthey must not be missed in the German text.
There stillexists deeper semantics which rules the decisions, butcannot be represented in general, except for very lim-ited cases.
Heuristic rules are based on our ambiguityconservation principle, i.e.
we keep the ambiguityof input text as much as possible to avoid any activeselection of one alternative, that might lead to a wrongexpression from the view point of the author of the ti-tles.
Following examples how typical errors of numbersand articles generated by the present SEMSYN heuristics.They also illustrate how difficult it is to find a tradeoff between the ambiguity conservation and an activedecision infered from the content:E.g.

On the other hand, it is ge-nerally assumed that a computer processes many programms.For this reason the latter plural case is more naturalthan tile former case.
However, it is a bad German tohave neither a number feature nor an article as it isin the original text.E.g.

The following conjunctive subnetwork isclassified into three basic cases:<arc I >- - - -@ -----<en urn>-- - -~@-- -~arc2>(i) <arc l>- - - - - (~  .

high-speed bus and memory management by stacksIn practice, however, we found that 90% of about 380 ti-tles which contain conjunctions among 2000 titles we sofar generated from the given semantic networks belongto the case (i); only about 8% are the case (ii), andthe rest is the case (iii).
This statistic results maybe spesific for the titles, but this indicates that au-thors of titles are aware of the syntactic structuralambiguity and consequently try to avoid the above straight-forward sequence of conjunctions except for the case (i).Beside this statistic sample-based facts, the conjunctiveambiguity is further weakened by the fact that the ge-neration system produces ambiguous titles according toour ambiguity conservation principle to let expertreaders naturally infer which is meant by the author.At the moment we deal with the both cases (ii) and didby exploiting this possibility to convey the ambiguityso as if it were the ease (i).Timugh this conjunctive ambiguity in semantic networksseemed to be a serious factor at our first glance onthem, it fortunately turned out to be a very minor pro-blem as the evaluation study indicates.3) ~c_prob lemGenerally speaking, a semantic based generation approachhas a strong advantage as well as disadvantage ill termsof sentence styles.
The stylistic advantage is based onthe large freedom of interpreting a given semantic re-presentation.
A serious disadvantage is the exactly theother side of this interpretation freedom.
Followingexamples i l lustrate typical stylistic problems of ourgeneration system:E.g.7 PD I L ~ 1 ~ 7 ' ~  \]" ~f f )~}~ , ~_~I/ - - ' ,%/=~I/  ,SEMSYN generation: Spezifikation, Simulation undEntwicklung von Protokollel~ fuer die PDIL verwendetwerden, fuer die Kommunikation(Specification, simulation and development of proto-kol, for which PDIL is applied, for the communication)Comment: "fuer die PDIL verwendet werden, ~{uerdie Kommunikation."
should be expressed as ".. sinesKommunikationsprotokolls unter Verwendung von PDIL.
"( ".. of a communication protocol by using PDIL", instead of " for which PDIL...)SEMSYN generation: Die Repraesentation yon Infor-mationen, die ableitbar in einem Speicher gewesenwerden.
(The representation f informations, which can bederived in a memory)Comment: The clause " .., die ableitbar.." shouldbe replaced by an adjective phrase 'iron der aus demSpeicher ableibaren Information".E.g.9 C 0 2 t / -~{L~;~C~ -~ ' 'N -~XS/~-~SEMSYN generation: Die Verwendung yon Datenbanksys-temen zu einem Verfahren zur Aufstellung von Be-dingungen beim Verfahren zur Verstaerkung yonOberflaechen des Kohlendioxidlasers(The application of data base systems for the list-ing of conditions for the surface hardening procedurewith CO2 laser.Comlaent: Instead of repeating nominalized caseframes for role purpose "Verfahren zur Aufstellung"and "Verfahren zur Verstaerkung" should the latterbe expressed as "Oberflaechenverhaerterungsverfahren"Though bad styled expressions may transmit he correctmeaning, they substantially reduce the understandabilityof the generated texts.
The stereotypical bad styles canbe easily improved ill some cases; however, the style con-version problems seem to have its inherent continuousdepth from "easy to patch" to the infinite depth to bepursued in a long run.4) Cultural difference problemsBefore we started the project we discussed many problemsthat arc specifically attributed to the well known cul-tural difference.
In the following given are some of thereal problems we encounted in dealing with title trans-lations:i) Focus shiftWe have frequently to come up with the difference offocussing, that forces us in a conflict situation whetherwe should prefer fidelity of the translation to the com-mon style of German titles.E.g.lO ~1 ~ 7" la -~,,'X O) ~ (~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~SEMSYN generation: Die Verwendung yon Semantikenzur Spezifikation von Kommunikationsprozessen(The application of semantics for specification ofcommunication processes)Comment: The original Japanese text does not con-tain an explicit word that coreponds to the semanticsymbol "USE.ACT", that is infered by tile analyzer.Generally speaking, however it sounds better in Ger-man if a expression explicates the meaning in a moreresolved form, while ambiguous expressions or evenfuzzy expressions are prefered in Japanese.
In thisexample the purpose arc expressed as "zur" impliesthe application of the semantics.ii) Reversed causalityTile most striking case that exemplifies the oppositerelation between east and west is the reversed expres-sion of causality, mostly would-be results are used in-stead of the cause in Japanese and vice versa in west.Following example demonstrates the fact:SEMSYN generation: Problems bei der Ausbildungueber Lehrer, die spezielles Computerwissen besitzen,innerhalb sines Schulsystems.
(Problems of training teachers, who own special com-puter knowledge, within the school systems)561Comment: Here the Japanese original text meansthat the special computer knowledge is a result ofthe training.
If the teachers have already this spe-cial knowledge, they don't need the training.
There-fore, it must be expressed as "so as to have .."At the moment neither our analyzer nor generator canafford such a deep understanding of input texts.
Ourapproach is still open to enrich the TRAIN scheme torepresent causal relation of the TRAIN concept which forces to reverse the causality of given meaning.HI.
EvaluationAbout 20% of the translation results produced from theavailable semantic networks are evaluated.
In order toavoid the misunderstanding it is worth to make it clearthat this evaluation was not done by the so-called blindtest, instead, all semantic networks are already used asour training samples.
This is because at the time whenthe evaluation study started we had only 2000 semanticnetworks available.
The evaluation results are summarizesas follows:Grade Fidelity Grammaticalityi 68.0% 16.7%2 29.7% 48.0%3 2.3% 19.0%4 0.0% 16.3%5 0.0% 0.0%Explanation:Grade Grammaticalityi: Exactly the same meaning as the original text2: Almost same content3: Still acceptable and informative4: Only partially acceptable5: Nothing to do with the content of the original textGrade Fidelity1: Correct style, syntax and morphology2: Correct syntax and morphology, but stylisticdefect and vice versa3: Still readable, but substantial mistakes insyntax, morphology and style4: Almost unreadable as German text5: Not GermanBased on this evaluation results we sorted our errorsources.
Following results show the error classificationfrom which the readers can figure out the developmentstate of our system.Error classification Occurrence among 300 titlesFidelity(a) Lexicon(not standard terms, inappropriate rms); I05(b) Selection of prepositions 89(c) Word construction (noun compounds) 88(d) Articles (def., indef.,) 50(e) Number (sing., plur.)
43(f) English terms (technical terms instead of German) 27(g) Relative clause instead of Np, PP 19(f) Focus 15(h) "Unter Verwendung von" 10(i) Possessive attribute "von" instead of genetive 8Grammatieality(i) Selection of preposit 34(ii) Word compounds 23(iii) Articles 14(iv) Relative clauses 12562(v) Focus 9(vi) Conjunction alignment 5(vii) Numbers 4(viii) Attributes 3The above classification indicates that dictionary pro-blem cannot be solved in a short term.
Especially in ourapproach, a semantic symbol generally corresponds to anupper concept, under which an appropriate German term isregistered as a specialization.
Therefore the terminol-ogy selection within a lexical entry is indirectly donethrough its context.
Again, this very advantage of expres-sion freedom causes a bad selection of a target word.
Weneed time to polish our semantic German terminology database so that system can select right German words in ge-neral.The noun compound is a specific problem in German.
Byconstructing a noun compound a stylistic problem mayelegantly be solved (cf.
e.g.9, I0), because otherwiseusing a modifier (possessive attributes, qualifiers andquantifiers, etc) results in an awful expressions thatcan not be compared with an alignment of English terms.We also found a conflict situation in connection wilhthe selection of technical ~t~'ms.
While we prefered com-mon English technical terms in the field of informalionprocessing as CS experts for tlle reason of easy under-standing, evaluators emphasize the authority of nation-al standard technical terms (DIN), e.g.
CRT (Datensicht-geraet), real-time (echtzeit), etc.The reason why the German ideom "unter Verwendung yon"was frequently used can be attributed to the semanticsymbol "USE.ACT", often infered (about I0%) by theanalysis ystem.
(Note: USE.ACT covers "verwenden (use)","anwenden (apply)", "Gebrauch machen (make use of)", bulalso <instrument> arc for "mit (with)", "}nit Hil?e yon(with the help of)", etc).
This means that the explica-tion of USE.ACT of an implied meaning in the originalJapanese text may either elucidate the situation in Ger-man (this is often the case) or make expression harder.By the same token a postpositional phrase or adjectivephrase of an original text may awkwardly be expressed ina German relative clause.
As the modifier and USE.ACTcases above mentioned, exemplify the situation, the overanalysis and over-expression are specific to our seman-tic based approach and could be avoided in other trans-fer approaches.IV.
ConclusionWe discussed some problems of our semantic based approach.Many of them are also common to other aproaches.
However,our approach seems to be open for continuous improvementin dealing with these problems.We express our sincere thanks to the ATLAS/It groupof Fujitsu Laboratory, Kawasaki for making semantic re-presentations available for our generationReference\[l\]Laubsch,J.,D.Roesner,A.Lesniewski,Hanakat a,K.
