We devel-oped a double layered machine learning ap-proach which utilizes a state-of-the-art mini-mized feature set for each of the event types.We improved the best performing systemof BioNLP 2009 overall, and ranked firstamongst 15 teams in finding ?Localization?events in 201112.
BioEvent is available athttp://bioevent.sourceforge.net/1 IntroductionA biological event refers to a specific kind of inter-action between biological entities.
Events consistof two parts: event triggers and event arguments.Event extraction can be very challenging when deal-ing with complex events with multiple or nested ar-guments; for example, events themselves can be anargument for other events.2 MethodsIn general, to detect an event mentioned in text, theevent trigger should be identified first, then comple-mented with event arguments.
We divided the train-ing and testing tasks into two phases: trigger detec-tion and argument detection.1Using the ?Approximate Span without Event TriggerMatching/Approximate Recursive?
metric2http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/-SharedTask/evaluation.shtml2.1 Event Trigger DetectionThe trigger detection problem can be modeled asa multi-class classification of a word or combina-tion of words (phrase).
Instead of using all possiblephrases in the training text as examples for the clas-sifier, we only included those that were known trig-gers in the training set.
For the official shared tasksubmission we used SVM light (Joachims, 1999).Detailed explanation of the trigger detection processincludes three main steps: pre-processing, trainingof the SVM models, and combining SVM results.Pre-processing.
All tokenized documents pro-vided by the shared task organizers (Stenetorp et al,2011) were converted to database records.
Then dif-ferent sets of attributes were defined and calculatedfor words, sentences and documents.Training SVM models and Combining Results.We trained 9 different binary SVM models usingone-vs-many approach.
One of the challenging taskswas to compare the results of different SVM models,given that each had different feature sets and theirconfidence values were not directly comparable andneeded to be calibrated properly before comparing.We tried three approaches: 1) selecting the SVM re-sult with highest positive distance to hyperplane, 2)using a trained decision tree and 3) using anotherSVM trained for voting.
Model J48 from the WEKAlibrary (Hall et al, 2009) was trained based on SVMdistances for the training set examples and expectedoutputs.
In the third approach, we tried SVM forvoting, which generated better results than the deci-sion tree.
Last two approaches consist of two layersof classifiers which first layer includes event typesclassifiers and second layer generates final decision153Event type Bioevent Turku09Gene expression 71.88 70.84Transcription 47.62 47.14Protein catabolism 60.87 60.87Phosphorylation 75.14 73.39Localization 61.49 59.68Binding 34.42 35.97Regulation 24.03 22.26Positive regulation 33.41 31.84Negative regulation 18.89 18.58ALL-TOTAL 44.69 43.54Table 1: F-Value from our BioEvent system compared toTurku09 (Bjorne et al, 2009) results, using ApproximateSpan/Approximate Recursive matchingbased on first layer outputs.2.2 Arguments detection and Post-processingSimilar to trigger detection, argument detection canbe modeled for a classification task by assigning anargument type label to each possible combinationof an event trigger and a biological entity in a sen-tence.
We obtained entities from a1 files, as well asthe supportive analysis data provided by the sharedtask organizers (Bjorne et al, 2009).
After gener-ating events using SVM classification, we mergedthem with the output from the Turku system to gen-erate the final result.
For common events (detectedby both systems) we used the arguments detected bythe Turku system.3 ResultsSince we tried to improve upon the best performingsystem in the 2009 competition (Turku09), we com-pare the results of our system and Turku09?s on the2011 test set.
Table 1 shows the performance of ourproposed system and that of Turku09.
We see thatBinding was our worst event (negative change), Lo-calization the most improved, no change for ProteinCatabolism, and only a slight improvement in Neg-ative Regulation.4 Conclusion and future workIn this research we focused on event trigger detec-tion by applying a SVM-based model.
SVM is verysensitive to parameters and further tuning of param-eters can improve the overall result.
Furthermore,we want to evaluate our method independently andfind the contribution of each modification to the fi-nal result.
Our method is generalizable to other do-mains by using proper train-set and finding usefulattributes for new event types.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Ryan Sullivanfor his helps during this research.
