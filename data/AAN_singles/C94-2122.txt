In this paper,we first; give a definition of polysemy from the view-point of clustering and then, b~rsed on this definition,we propose a clustering method which reeognises ver-bal 1)olysemics from a textual corpus.
The results ofexperiments denmnstrate the effectiveness of the pro-I)osed method.1 In t roduct ion'\]?here has 1)een quite a h)t of research concerned withautomatic lustering of semantically similar words orautomatic recognition of colloc~rtions among them fromeorl)ort~ \[Church, 1OVl\], \[Hindle, 1991\], \[Smadja, 1991\].Most of this work is based on similarity measures de-rived fl'om the distrilmtion of woMs in corpora.
How-ever, the Nets that a single word does have more thanone meaning and that the distribution of a word in acorpus is a mixture of usages of different meanings ofthe same word often hamper such atteml~ts.The meaning of a word depends on the domain inwhich it is used; the sitme word c'an be use(l differentlyin different dolnains.
It is also often the ease theft aword which is l/olysemous in general is not l)olysemousin a r(,strieted subject domain.
In general, restrictionof tllc subject domain makes the t)roblenl of 1)olysemyless l)rol)lematie.
However, even in texts fronl a re-stricted domain such as Wall Street Journal l, one en-eount.ers quite a large nulnber of l)olyselnous words, inparticular, unlike nouns, verbs are often i/olys(mwusev(,n in a restricted subject domain.Because polysemous verbs are usually also high-frequency verbs, their treal:ment is crucial ill actualapplications.
Furthermore, beeause of their high-frequen(:y, polysemous verbs tend to have a harmflfl in-th,ence on the senlantic ehtstering of l/ollns, \])eeallSO se-mantic clustering of nollns is usually 1)eribrmed basedon th(.ir eollo('ational 1)ehaviour with verbs.

E-mail fukumoto~skyc.esi,yamalmshi.ac.jpt Wal l  St reet  ,lo'~tr'nal was prepared by ACi,(Associalkm for(~omputational IAt~gMstics' Data Collection Initi~ttivu) in \[99l.Although polysemy is said to be widespread in lan-guage, the definition of polysemy is highly subjective.Polysemy can only be recognised by hunmn intuitionand different linguists often identify a different numberof  senses in the same word.
In this paper, we first give adefinition of polysemy fl'om the viewpoint of clustering,and propose an overlapping clustering method whichautomatically reeognises polysemous words.
The re-sults of experiments are also given to demonstrate theeffectiveness of our method.2 Re la ted  WorkAlthough there have been several attempts to extractsemantically similar words from a, given corpus, fewstudies seriously deal with the problenl of 1)olysemy;of these, even fewer are based on real texts.The techniques developed by Zernik \[Zernik, 1991\]and Brown \[Brown, 1991\] seem to cope with the dis-crimination of polysemy and 1)e ll~Lse(l on real texts.Zernik used monolingual texts which consist of about1 nfillion words tagged by 1)art-of-spee(:h. I~Iis methodassociates ca(-h word se.nse of a polysemous woM witha set of its co-occurring words.
If a word has seweral senses, then the word is assoeiated with severaldifferent sets of co-occurring words, each of which cor-responds to one of the senses of the word.
The linfita-tion of Zernik's method, however, is that it solely re-lies on human intuition for identifying different sensesof a word, i.e.
the human editor tlas to determine, byher/his intuition, how many seilses a word has, andthen identii~y the sets of co-occurring words (signa-t.lcres) that correspond to the different senses.Brown used bilingual texts, which consist of \]2 mil-lion words.
The results of Brown's technique, when al)-plied to a French-English nmchine transb~tion system,seems to show its eflbctiveness and validity.
However,as he admits, the at)preach is linfited because it canonly assign at most two senses to a word.
More seri-ously, 1)olysemy is defined in terms of translation, i.e.only when a word is Lranslated into two different wordsin a target language, it is recogniscd as polysemous.The apllroach can bc used only when a large 1)aral -lel corpus is awdhtble.
Furthermore, individual sensesthus identified (1(1 not neeessarily constitute single se-mantic units in the monolingual domain to which 1)lau-sible semantic prollertics (i.e.
semantic rest;rictions,762colhlcations, etc.)
can lie associated.The defects of these two methods how that it is cru-cial to have an N)pr()l)riate detinition of polyscmy interms of distributimml 1)char|ours of words in mono-lingual texts.
The approach proposed iu this paperfocuses on this problem.
Like Brown's apl)roach , oural)proach ad(lpts ;L rebttivist.ic vicw of polysclny.
Thatis, ~ word is rccognised as l)olysenmus in terms of otherrelai.ed words..\[{owever, while Brown's al)l)roach idcn-tilies polysemous words in terms of rela~ted words ofram|her lmigui~gc, we.
use semantically similar wordsof the same llmguage to identify polysemous words.Whether a word is polysemous or nol; depends onwhether i~ set of other, semanti('Mly similar words ex-ists whose distrilmtional 1)eh~viours correspond to itsitbset of the distributionM behaviour of the word.Because tile distributional beiu~viour of it word ischaracter|seal 1)y its co-occurring words, the t)rocess ofidentifying such subsets essentially correslmuds to 1.he1)rocess llcrformed manually by {:he hmnan edil.or inZernik's approach.The experilmm~s in this p~ller use a corlluS &llllO-tal;ed only 1)y 1)art-ofsl)eech 1)ut not structurally an-notltl;cd.

However, these algo-rithms assume that ewm an entity which belongs tomore than one clusters is still a single entity.
An en-tity behmgs to several clusters because it can be seenfrom several different viewpoints.
'rite same entity, forexample, egg, can be seen as food, like bread, and asingredients-of-food, like flour, at the same time.However, as we saw in the above, polyselnous verbscan be captured more naturally by seeing them as mul-tiple entities, which hal)pen to take the same surfaceform.
take l ,  take2 and take3 are distinct; entities(we (:all them hypothetical verbs in the following) withwhich different sets of nouns co-occur, and with which,therefore~ ditferent contexts are associated.Therefore, unlike standard overlapping clustering al-gorithms, our algorithm explicitly introduces new en-tities when an entity is judged polysemous and asso-ciates them with contexts which are subcontexts ofthe context of the original entity.
Our algorithm hastwo basic operations, splittin9 and lumping.
Splitt ingmeans to divide a polysemous verb into two hypothet-ical wwbs and lumping means to combine two hypo-theticai verbs to make one verb out of them.4 Measur ing  the  Compactnessof a Group o f  VerbsThe algorithm should decide when a verb has to hesplit into two hypothetical verbs.
The decision is basedon a measure of the sel-ilan~;ic compactness of a groupof verbs.
The semantic ompactness of a group of verbsis a measure which shows the degree of dispersion ofthe group in an n-dimensional space.
The compactnessof a group of verbs, VG= {vl, v2, ... ,  v,~}, is definedas follows.1.
Let vi be one of the verbs v,, ?
.., v,,, and a vectorassigned to vi be (vii, " ", vm).
Each vij(1 < j <_n) is computed by the following formula.vii = mu(v i ,  t,j) if'mu(vi,n5) >_ a,0 otherwise (1)IIere, mu(vi ,  n j) is the vahle of mutual  informa-e t ion defined in \[Chur Jr, 1991\] between t~i and nj.c~ is a threshold value given in advance.2.
The centre of gravity of a group of verbs, vl, ?
?.,v , ,  is the mean vector of the vectors assigned tothe verbs~ which is used to eompute the disper-sions of the individual verbs in the group.
The(:entre of gravity ~ = (g t , ' " ,  g~), and the lengthof it I 9 \[, are defined as follows.(,?1,.

?~)  = ~ ' i~ , "  " - -  v i , , )  ' H?,i=l i=1tl  Wt(2)3.
The dispersion, disp(v l , .

Let us think of two clusters of verbs, A and B,which have the same degree of dispersions.
If I g Iof A is larger than that of B, the absolute vMueof mu calculated for A is larger than that of \]3.This means that the absolute probabilities of co-occurrences of each notln and the verbs of A islarger than those of B; zus a result, A shouhl bejudged to be semantically more compact han B.Therefore, the dispersion of (3) is amrmalised ms:5.disp(v~,.

,  ~,,~) = I~1 (4)disp,~o,, of (4) is prolmrdonal to the number ofverbs.
This means that a cluster of a greaternumber of verbs tends to be judged to be lesscompact han those, of a smaller number of verbs.Therefore, the dispersion of (4) should be fl~rthernormalised to compensatc the effect of the num-ber of verbs in a group.
This normalisation isdone by least square estimation.
The result is (5),which will be used to measure the COml)aetness ofa group of verbs.C'o , , , ( , ,~ ,  .
