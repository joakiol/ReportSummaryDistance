SRA :DESCRIPTION OF THE SOLOMON SYSTEM AS USED FO RMUC- 4Chinatsu Aone, Doug McKee, Sandy Shinn, Hatte Bleje rSystems Research and Applications (SRA )2000 15th Street NorthArlington, VA 2220 1aonec?sra.comBACKGROUNDSRA's knowledge-based natural language processing system SOLOMON has been developed for text under -standing since 1986 .
In addition to being a domain-independent NLP system, starting in the fall of 1990 ,SOLOMON has been extended as part of the MURASAKI project to become a multi-lingual text under-standing system .
It currently understands Spanish and Japanese as well as English texts .
In order to achievedomain- and language-independence, SOLOMON separates data from processing modules .
The processingmodules do not assume any domain- or language-dependent facts ; rather they are designed so that theywork off separate data, i .e .
lexicons, grammars, patterns, and knowledge bases, which vary according to th edomain or language .
To facilitate data acquisition, SRA has developed 2 tools : LEXToo1 for the developmentof lexicons and KBTool for the development of knowledge bases .MUC-4 SYSTEM ARCHITECTUR ESRA's system as used for MUC-4 consists of the core NLP system SOLOMON, the Message Zoner, an dExtract, as shown in Figure 1 .
SOLOMON consists of 5 processing modules : Preprocessing, Syntax, Se-mantics, Discourse and Pragmatics modules .
The data SOLOMON used for MUC-4 consists of the lexicons ,the grammar, the patterns, and the knowledge bases .
In order to handle MUC-4 messages, the Messag eZoner and the Pragmatics module were significantly extended, and the MUC-4 specific lexicons and knowl-edge bases were added to the existing data.
In the following, each of the modules is explained along wit hexamples from message TST2-MUC4-0048 .Message Zone rThe Message Zoner is the entry point for text into the MUC-4 Data Extraction system .
It parses the freetext areas of the incoming message into sections, tables, itemized lists, paragraphs, sentences, and individua ltokens.
This processing is domain-independent .
The Zoner also parses the formatted header information forthe particular message type .
The Zoner 's output is a canonical structure that we use for all of our projects ,including projects which deal with non-English texts .
Only paragraphs that contain certain MUC-specifi ckeywords are processed by SOLOMON .259smarm~'~f0?

ConstraintsUnrnlpare?.---"..-/ 'nMoogr4rA6ndaftlbwIn1COman-SPAEmusOrsrr.Figure 1 : MUG-4 System ArchitecturePreprocessingThe Preprocessing module performs word- and phrase-level analyses of input sentences .
Since there are threetypes of lexicons, namely, the domain lexicons, the core lexicon and the "shallow" lexicon derived from alarge corpus (i .e.
the Dow Jones corpus from the Penn Treebank), when there is more than one entry wit hthe same category for a word, the entry from the more specific lexicon is preferred .In addition to regular lexical lookup and morphological analysis, the Preprocessing module uses variou spatterns to recognize productive multiwords and complex phrases like dates, personal names, organizatio nnames, locations, and so on .
Also, it performs acronym absorption, where an acronym after a proper nou nlike "FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)" is removed from the output ofpreprocessing and learned by the system.
The next time that acronym appears in isolation, preprocessin gwill understand that it has the same meaning as the original proper noun .
Spelling correction and unknownword handling based on morphological endings are also performed .Name RecognitionDuring preprocessing, proper names like "ALFREDO CRISTIANI" and "ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO "are dynamically recognized by the Spanish name pattern, which has been developed for the MURASAKIproject, using the first names as anchors .
The output of preprocessing for "ROBERTO GARCIA AL-VARADO" is shown in Figure 2 .In addition, subsequent references to parts of these names, like "GARCIA", are resolved using theinformation learned by the pattern .
In this way, we do not need to put all the possible name combination sin the lexicon, but rather put only first names in the lexicon .26 0[ST: <PROPN>ROOT : ROBERTO-GARCIA-ALVARAD OCATEGORY : PROPNSEM-POINTER: MAN .31 0NAME : (ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO )INFLECTION : (3SG )DEFINITE : TORIGIN : (SPANISH )FIRST : ROBERTOSURNAME : GARCIA]Figure 2 : Preprocessing: Name PatternSyntactic Analysi sSentences are parsed using an X-bar-based phrase structure grammar, and SRA's custom modification ofthe Tomita parser, which handles Japanese and Spanish as well as English .
The parser output is gram-matical structures called Functionally Labelled Templates (FLTs) which are built using a linguistic for-malism that modifies and extends the f-structure of Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) .
These structuresmark grammatical functions, like subject, object, specifier, and complement .
Since the FLT formalism i slanguage-independent, the same semantic interpretation module is used for all languages .PreparsingThe MUC sentences are fairly long and complex, but in many cases SOLOMON will recognize major con-stituent boundaries using simple heuristics .
For example, if a proper name is directly followed by a comma ,some words, and another comma, then those words between the commas are assumed to be a constituent at-taching to the proper name as an appositive (e .g .
"ALFREDO CRISTIANI, NATIONALIST REPUBLICA NALLIANCE (ARENA) PRESIDENT-ELECT," ) .
Other easily recognized probable constituents include " ac-cording to" phrases and "that" clauses following communication verbs .
These smaller constituents are sen tto general parsing in isolation before processing the entire sentence .Debris ParsingIf general syntactic parsing of a sentence or constituent either fails or is taking too much time, the Debri sParsing module is invoked .
First, the largest and best-weighted non-overlapping constituents recognize dduring parsing are extracted from the parse stack .
The rest of the input is sent back into general parsin gand debris parsing if necessary.
When the entire sentence has been passed back to the parser, the resultin gconstituents are put together in a debris FLT.
These structures are handled by a special submodule o fSemantic Interpretation, called Debris Semantics .Semantic InterpretationThe Semantic Interpretation module interprets the grammatical structures (FLTs) to produce language-independent meaning representations called Semantically Labelled Templates (SLTs) .
It performs semanticambiguity resolution both during parsing (to reduce the number of parses) and during the construction ofSLTs (so that the best possible semantic interpretation is obtained .)
The representation at this level is261Verb : "accuse' 'Situation Type : CAUSED-PROCES SNLRB object for mapping : ACCUSEIdiosyncracies : ((GOAL (MAPPING (LITERAL OF))) )Napping :(GOAL (MAPPING (LITERAL OF)) (TYPE SITUATION) )(AGENT (MAPPING (SURFACE SUBJECT)) (TYPE PERSON ORGANIZATION) )(THEME (MAPPING (SURFACE OBJECT) (TYPE PERSON ORGANIZATION)) )Figure 3 : Mapping Information for "accuse"language-independent because the representation language is based on the concepts in the knowledge baseswhich are shared among languages .Verb mapping information is derived from both lexicons and KBs .
In general, a lexical entry tells how eac hsurface syntactic role is mapped to its corresponding thematic role, and a KB entry tells what the semanti ctype restrictions on these roles are .
When necessary, however, lexical idiosyncracies, either syntactic o rsemantic, can be recorded in the lexicons .
The mapping information for "accuse" is shown in Figure 3 .
Thesemantic concepts representing verbs like "accuse", "condemn", and "blame" are subclasses of a concep tcalled JUDGEMENT-EVENT in our KB .
The GOAL of this event (i .e .
the embedded sentences under thes everbs) are thus taken as facts, and mapped to the template as such .Debris SemanticsWhen the Semantics module receives the output of Debris Parsing, it must process a collection of fragmen-tary syntactic constituents rather than a fully analyzed FLT .
Debris Semantics will call general semanti cinterpretation on each of these constituents and fit them together as best it can based on semantic knowl-edge and constraints .
This involves choosing a top-level S from the syntactic fragments, fitting the othe rfragments into it, and producing the most salient semantic interpretation for the sentence .NominalizationsNominalized verbs, which often describe terrorist events as in "THE KILLING OF ATTORNEY GENERA LROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO", "THE MURDER OF 10 UNION MEMBERS", and "THE ATTAC KON FENASTRAS" are treated semantically like ordinary verbs .
That is, the nouns "killing", "murder", an d"attack" are mapped to event frames in the KBs (i.e .
MURDER, KILL, and ATTACK respectively), an dthe modifying PPs of appropriate types become the THEME of these events, as in Figure 4 .AppositivesBoth pre- and post-appositives like "ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO" an d"MANUEL VALLEJO URIBE, A BUSINESSMAN" are interpreted so that the KB objects for the hea dnouns get additional class information provided by the appositives .
In Figure 4, the appositive "ATTORNE YGENERAL" is interpreted so that the frame MAN.472 representing "ROBERT GARCIA ALVARADO" ob-tains additional ISA information (i .e .
GOVERNMENT-OFFICIAL) from the appositive .
This semanti cinterpretation enables resolution of the subsequent reference to the same man by "THE ATTORNEY GEN-ERAL" in S21 (cf .
Appendix A) in discourse processing .262(XILL.475 (ISA (VALUE RILL) )(THEME (VALUE MAN .472) )(UNIT (VALUE NATURAL-UNIT) )(QUANTITY (VALUE (EXACT 1)) )(SITUATION-TYPE (VALUE (CAUSED-PROCESS)) )(DEFINITE (VALUE T) )(ACTION-LINE (VALUE EILL .475) )(ACTION-RELATION (VALUE RESULT)) )(MAN .472 (ISA (VALUE GOVERNMENT-OFFICIAL MAN) )(NAMES (VALUE (ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO)) )(QUANTITY (VALUE (EXACT 1)) )(UNIT (VALUE NATURAL-UNIT)) )Figure 4 : Semantics of "THE KILLING OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO "Discourse Analysi sThe Discourse Analysis module performs pronoun and definite NP resolution .
Although this module handlessome interesting phenomena such as partitives and super-subclass reference, this module needs the mos twork, especially to be able to handle phenomena which occur in other languages like Spanish and Japanese .Limited event discourse in terms of causality reasoning is done by Pragmatic Inferencing .
For example, if itis mentioned that there was some terrorist attack and subsequently 3 people were found dead, we infer thatthe terrorist attack was the cause of the death of 3 people .
Thus, we merge these 2 events into one terroris tevent .
We are planning to expand and incorporate the event discourse component into the Discourse module .PartitivesSOLOMON handles partitives well because many of the domains for which it has been used call for un-derstanding complex quantity expressions .
The partitives like "FOUR OF THE VICE PRESIDENT'SCHILDREN" and "ONE OF THEM " , are interpreted by semantics so that the head noun (e .g .
"ONE " ,"FOUR") represents a part of the object represented by the NP in the "of" phrase.
The NP in the "of" phraseof the partitive construction must be a definite NP .
Thus, getting the correct interpretation for partitive salways requires correct definite anaphora resolution .
In Figure 5, "THEM" in S22 was correctly resolved to"TWO BODYGUARDS", which is represented by SECURITY-GUARD .292 in the SET-PARENT slot ofENTITY .299 representing "ONE" .Reference by Superclass Concept sThe discourse resolution of "THE CRIME" to "KILLING " in 51 is handled by resorting to the KB hierarchy.One of SOLOMON's anaphora resolution strategies is to look for an antecedent whose concept is a subclas sof the concept represented by the anaphora .
For example, in "John has a pet iguana, and he loves thislizard .
", "this lizard" is resolved to "a pet iguana" because the concept IGUANA is a subclass of the concep t"LIZARD" in the KB .The nominalized event reference "THE CRIME" is resolved in the same way.
As explained earlier, anominalized verb like "killing" is mapped to an event concept, in this case KILL, in the KB .
The nou n"crime" is mapped to the concept ANTI-CREATION-EVENT, which has subclasses like MURDER, AT-TACK, BOMB-EVENT, DESTROY, and so on.
KILL is also a subclass of ANTI-CREATION-EVENT, an dtherefore "THE CRIME " is resolved to "KILLING " .
In this way, the two events are merged and a singl e263(ENTITY.299 (ISA (VALUE ENTITY) )(QUANTITY (VALUE (EXACT 1)) )(UNIT (VALUE NATURAL-UNIT) )(SET-PARENT (VALUE SECURITY-GUARD .292) )(TOKENS (VALUE (ONE OF THEM))) )(SECURITY-GUARD.292 (ISA (VALUE SECURITY-GUARD) )(QUANTITY (VALUE (EXACT 2)) )(UNIT (VALUE NATURAL-UNIT) )(TOKENS (VALUE (THEM )(TWO BODYGUARDS))) )(IIJURE .300 (ISA (VALUE INJURE) )(SITUATION-TYPE (VALUE CAUSED-PROCESS) )(THEME (VALUE EITITY .299) )(TENSE (VALUE PAST)) )Figure 5 : Semantics of "ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED "(MA1 .478 LISA (VALUE GOVERNMENT-OFFICIAL MAI) )(NAMES (VALUE (FRANCISCO MERINO)) )(QUANTITY (VALUE (EXACT 1)) )(TOKENS(VALUE (VICE PRESIDENT ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO)) )(UNIT (VALUE NATURAL-UNIT)) )(CIVILIAN-RESIDEICE .480 (ISA (VALUE CIVILIAN-RESIDENCE) )(OCCUPIED-BY (VALUE MAI .478) )(QUANTITY (VALUE (EXACT 1)) )(UNIT (VALUE NATURAL-UNIT) )(TOKENS (VALUE (MERINO -S HOME))) )Figure 6 : Semantics of "MERINO'S HOME "template is created from S1 .Pragmatic InferencingThis module was exploited extensively for the MUC-4 task in order to, perform reasoning needed to go fro mliteral interpretation of messages in our semantic representation to the MUC-4 template representation .
Forexample, in S11 of message 0048, "MERINO'S HOME" should be categorized as GOVERNMENT OFFIC EOR RESIDENCE because Merino is a vice president-elect .
However, the default semantic type of "HOME"is CIVILIAN RESIDENCE, as shown in Figure 6 .
From this representation to the actual template, one mus tinfer that a residence occupied by a government official is a government residence .We made extensive use of the forward chainer of SRA's knowledge representation language TURNKE Yfor this kind of reasoning .
It should be made clear that none of the forward rules are specific to particula rterrorist incidents .
Rather, all the rules reflect our commonsense reasoning .
The rule which deals with thetype of inference needed for the Merino example is Rule-025 in Figure 7 .In order to handle S12, where it should be determined that people in Merino's home were also targets ,we added; after the final testing, another rule Rule-064, which says that any person inside a physical targe tis a human target .264(defrule rule-025 ((?x) (?x) ):example ("several homes of important government officials were looted .
."
):if (and (or (civilian-residence ?x )(facility ?x) )(occupied-by ?x ?occ )(or (government-official ?occ )(agency ?occ )(committee ?occ )(government ?occ )(international-governmental-organization ?occ)) ):then (government-facility ?x) )(defrule rule-064 ((?attack ?person) (?attack) ):example ("John's home was attacked ."
" there were 3 children in the home ."
):if (and (lisp-eval (script-general-muc-nature ?attack) )(theme ?attack ?pt )(physical-area ?pt )(person ?person )(location ?person ?pt) ):then (theme ?attack ?person))Figure 7 : Forward Chaining RulesExtractThe Extract module translates the domain-relevant portions of our language-independent meaning represen-tation into database records .
We maintain a strong distinction between code and data, and in fact use th esame code to output to several databases ; including flat template-style and more object-oriented schemas .Given a top-level event for each processed sentence in the text, Extract decides what subevents of thos etop-level events can be assumed true and therefore extracted from .
For example, if killing is condemned, asin S1, then that killing is mapped to the database .We employ a fairly simple event merging strategy.
Eventually we hope to handle this in discourse .
Twoevents are merged when they have the same stage-of-execution, their "types" are compatible (i .e .
eithe ridentical or one is just an attack), and one of the following conditions is met :1.
Both events have the same target .2.
Either event has no target .3.
Either event is only reporting deaths, injuries, or victims .Unfortunately, this strategy does not merge the events in S21-22 with the event described in Si since bothincidents already have human targets .
Of these merged events, Extract filters out those events which shoul dnot be mapped according to the rather complicated description provided in the MUC-4 task documentation .To do the actual template filling, we rely on Extract data made up of kb-object/slot to db-table/fieldmapping rules and conversion functions for the individual values .
For example, our AGENT slot in anATTACK event corresponds to the PERPETRATOR fields in the MUC template .
Information from th efree text of the message is combined with that in the header when the text is not explicit about the date o rlocation of the incidents .265APPENDIXSentences from TST2-MUC4-0048Sl : SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIAII CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST KILLING OF ATTORNE YGENERAL ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO AND ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN )OF THE CRIME .S11-13: GUERRILLAS ATTACKED MERINO'S HOME IN SAN SALVADOR 5 DAYS AGO WITH EXPLOSIVES .
