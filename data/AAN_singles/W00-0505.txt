After describing the proposedsystem's usage scenario and system design,we describe our investigation of transferringinformation extraction techniques developedfor English to Korean.
We conclude with abrief discussion of related MT issues we planto investigate in future work.1 IntroductionIn this paper, we report on a small studyundertaken to demonstrate the feasibility ofcombining portable information extraction withMT in order to support ranslingual informationaccess.
The goal of our proposed system is tobetter enable analysts to perform informationfiltering tasks on foreign language documents.This effort was funded by a SBIR Phase I awardfrom the U.S. Army Research Lab, and will bepursued further under the DARPA TIDESinitiative.Information extraction (IE) systems aredesigned to extract specific types of informationfrom natural language texts.
In order to achieveacceptable accuracy, IE systems need to betuned for a given topic domain.
Since thisdomain tuning can be labor intensive, recent IEresearch has focused on developing learningalgorithms for training IE system components(cf.
Cardie, 1997, for a survey).
To date,however, little work has been done on IEsystems for languages other than English(though cf.
MUC-5, 1994, and MUC-7, 1998,for Japanese IE systems); and, to our knowledge,none of the available techniques for the core taskof learning information extraction patterns havebeen extended or evaluated for multilingualinformation extraction (though again cf.
MUC-7,1998, where the use of learning techniques forthe IE subtasks of named entity recognition andcoreference r solution are described).Given this situation, the primary objective ofour study was to demonstrate he feasibility ofusing portable--i.e., easily trainable--IEtechnology on Korean documents, focusing ontechniques for learning information extractionpatterns.
Secondary objectives of the study wereto elaborate the analyst scenario and systemdesign.2 Analyst ScenarioFigure 1 illustrates how an intelligence analystmight use the proposed system:?

Eachscenario template corresponds to a specifictype of event.
Available scenario templatesmight include troop movements, acts ofviolence, meetings and negotiathms,protests, etc.
In Figure 1, the selected eventis of type meeting (understood broadly).The analyst fills in the available slots of theselected scenario template in order to restrictthe search to the information considered tobe relevant.
In Figure 1, the values specifiedin the scenario template indicate that theinformation to f'md is about meetings havingas location South Korea and as issue NorthKorea and missiles.

In Figure 1, the selectedboxes under the Report column indicate thatall information found satisfying the queryshould be reported except for the meetingparticipants.

Once the analyst submits the query forevaluation, the system searches the inputdocuments for information matching thequery.
As a result, a hypertext document isgenerated describing the informationmatching the query as well as the source ofthis information.
Note that the querycontains English keywords that areautomatically translated into Korean prior tomatching.
The extracted information ispresented in English after being translatedfrom Korean.
In Figure 1, the generatedhypertext response indicates two documentsin the input set that matched the querytotally or in part.
Each summary in theresponse includes just the translations of theextracted information that the analystrequested to be reported.?
For each document extract matching theanalyst query, the analyst can obtain acomplete machine translation of the Koreandocument where the match was found, andwhere the matched information ishighlighted.
Working with a humantranslator, the analyst can also verify theaccuracy of the reported information byaccessing the documents in their originallanguage.3 System DesignFigure 2 shows the high-level design of thesystem.
It consists of the following components:?
The User Interface.
The browser-basedinterface is for entering queries anddisplaying the resulting presentations.?
The Portable Information Extractor (PIE)component.
The PIE component uses theWhile in this example the exclusion of participantinformation in the resulting report is rather artificial,in general a scenario template may contain manydifferent ypes of information, not all of which arelikely to interest an analyst at once.Extraction Pattem Library - -  whichcontains the set of extraction patternslearned in the lab, one set per scenariotemplate - -  to extract specific types ofinformation from the input Koreandocuments, once parsed.?
The Ranker component.
This componentranks the extracted information returned bythe PIE component according to how well itmatches the keyword restrictions in thequery.
The MT component's English-to-Korean Transfer Lexicon is used to map theEnglish keywords to corresponding Koreanones.
When the match falls below a user-?
configurable threshold, the extractedinformation is filtered out.?
The MT component.
The MT component(cf.
Lavoie et al, 2000) translates theextracted Korean phrases or sentences intocorresponding English ones.?
The Presentation Generator component.This component generates well-organized,easy-to-read hypertext presentations byorganizing and formatting the rankedextracted information.
It uses existing NLGcomponents, including the Exemplars textplanning framework (White and Caldwell,1998) and the RealPro syntactic realizer(Lavoie and Rainbow, 1997).In our feasibility study, the majority of the effortwent towards developing the PIE component,described in the next section.
This componentwas implemented in a general way, i.e.
in a waythat we would expect to work beyond thespecific training/test corpus described below.
Incontrast, we only implemented initial versions ofthe User Interface, Ranker and PresentationGenerator components, in order to demonstratethe system concept; that is, these initial versionswere only intended.to work with our training/testcorpus, and will require considerable furtherdevelopment prior to reaching operational status.For the MT component, we used an earlyversion of the lexical transfer-based systemcurrently under development in an ongoingSBIR Phase II project (cf.
Nasr et al, 1997;Palmer et al, 1998; Lavoie et al, 2000), thoughwith a limited lexicon specifically for translatingthe slot fillers in our training/test corpus.33Korean DocumentsParserTagged lKorean Documents ( LexiconK?rean 1~ Syntactic .

2 We then gathered a small corpus of thirtyarticles by searching for articles containing"North Korea" and one or more of about 15keywords.
The first two sentences (with a fewexceptions) were then annotated with the slots tobe extracted, leading to a total of 51 sentencescontaining 47 scenario templates and 89 total2 In the end, we did not use the 'issue' slot shown inFigure 1, as it contained more complex Idlers thanthose that ypically have been handled in IE systems.correct slots.
Note that in a couple of casesmore than one template was given for a singlelong sentence.When compared to the MUC scenariotemplate task, our extraction task wasconsiderably simpler, for the following reasons:* The answer keys only contained informationthat could be found within a single sentence,i.e.
the answer keys did not require merginginformation across entences.?
The answer keys did not require anaphoricreferences to be resolved, and we did notdeal with conjuncts eparately.?
We did not attempt o normalize dates orremove appositives from NPs.4.2 Extraction Pattern LearningFor our feasibility study, we chose to follow theAutoSlog (Lehnert et al, 1992; Riloff, 1993)approach to extraction pattern acquisition.
Inthis approach, extraction patterns are acquired34i.
E:K:<target-np>=<subject> <active voice verb><participant> MET<target-np>=<subject> <active voice verb><John-i> MANNASSTA<John-nom>'MET2.
E:K:<target-np>=<subject> <verb> <infinitive><participant> agreed to MEET<target-np>=<subject> <verbl-ki- lo> <verb2><John-un> MANNA-ki- lo hapuyhayssta<John-nom> MEET-ki- lo agreed(-ki: nominalization ending, -io: an adverbial postposition)Figure 3via a one-shot general-to-specific learningalgorithm designed specifically for theinformation extraction task.
3 The learningalgorithm is straightforward and depends onlyon the existence of a (partial) parser and a smallset of general inguistic patterns that direct thecreation of specific patterns.
As a trainingcorpus, it requires a set of texts with nounphrases annotated with the slot type to beextracted.To adapt the AutoSlog approach to Korean,we first devised Korean equivalents of theEnglish patterns, two of which are shown inFigure 3.
It turned out that for our corpus, wecould collapse some of these patterns, thoughsome new ones were also needed.
In the end weused just nine generic patterns.Important issues that arose in adapting theapproach were (1) greater flexibility in wordorder and heavier reliance on morphologicalcues in Korean, and (2) the predominance oflight verbs (verbs with little semantic ontent oftheir own) and aspectual verbs in the chosendomain.
We discuss these issues in the next twosections.4.3 Korean ParserWe used Yoon's hybrid statistical Korean parser(Yoon et al, 1997, 1999; Yoon, 1999) to processthe input sentences prior to extraction.
Theparser incorporates a POS tagger and3 For TIDES, we plan to use more sophisticatedlearning algorithms, as well as active learningtechniques, such as those described in Thompson etal.
(1999).morphological nalyzer and yields a dependencyrepresentation as its output?
The use of adependency representation e abled us to handlethe greater flexibility in word order in Korean.To facilitate pattern matching, we wrote asimple program to convert he parser's output oXML form.
During the XML conversion, twosimple heuristics were applied, one to recoverimplicit subjects, and another to correct arecurring misanalysis of noun compounds.4.4 Trigger Word Filtering andGeneralizationIn the newswire corpus we looked at, meetingevents were rarely described with the verb'mannata' ('to meet').
Instead, they wereusually described with a noun that stands for'meeting' and a light or aspectual verb, forexample, 'hoyuy-lul kacta' ('to have a meeting')or 'hoyuy-lul machita' ('to finish a meeting').In order to acquire extraction patterns that madeappropriate use of such collocations, we decidedto go beyond the AutoSlog approach andexplicitly group trigger words (such as 'hoyuy')into classes, and to likewise group anycollocations, such as those involving light verbsor aspectual verbs.
To fmd collocations for thetrigger words, we reviewed a Korean lexical co-occurrence base which was constructed from acorpus of 40 million words (Yoon et al, 1997).We then used the resulting specification to filterthe learned patterns to just those containing the4 Overall dependency precision is reported to be89.4% (Yoon, 1999).35.
- !trigger words or trigger word collocations, aswell as to generalize the patterns to the wordclass level.
Because the number of tr:iggerwords is small, this specification can be donequickly, and soon pays off in terms of timesaved in manually filtering the learned patterns.4.5 ResultsIn testing our approach, we obtained overallresults of 79% recall and 67% precision in ahold-one-out cross validation test.
In a crossvalidation test, one repeatedly divides a corpusinto different raining and test sets, averaging theresults; in the hold-one-out version, the systemis tested on a held-out example after beingtrained on the rest.
In the IE setting, the recallmeasure is the number of correct slots founddivided by the total number of correct slots,while the precision measure is the number ofcorrect slots found divided by the total numberof slots found.While direct comparisons with the MUCconference results cannot be made for thereasons we gave above, we neverthelessconsider these results quite promising, as thesescores exceed the best scores reported at MUC-6on the scenario template task.

Wemay note that precision is low for date andlocation slots because we used a simplisticsentence-level merge, rather than dependencies.To measure the impact of our approach togeneralization, we may compare the results in5http://www.nist.gov/itl/div894/894.02/related_projects/tipster/muc.htmTable 1 with those shown in Table 2, wheregeneralization is not used.
As can be seen, thegeneralization step adds substantially to overallrecall.To illustrate the effect of generalization,consider the pattern to extract he subject NP ofthe light verb 'kac (hold)' when paired with anobject NP headed by the noun 'hyepsang(negotiation)'.
Since this pattern only occursonce in our corpus, the slot is not successfullyextracted in the cross-validation test withoutgeneralization.
However, since this exampledoes fall under the more generalized pattern ofextracting the subject NP of a verb in the lightverb class when paired with an object NPheaded by a noun the 'hoytam-hyepsang' class,the slot is successfully extracted in the cross-validation test using the generalized patterns.Cases like these are the source of the 18% boostin recall of participant slots, from 57% to 75%.5 DiscussionOur feasibility study has focused our attentionon several questions concerning the interactionof IE and MT, which we hope to pursue underthe DARPA TIDES initiative.
One question isthe extent o which slot filler translation is morepracticable than general-purpose MT; one wouldexpect to achieve much higher quality on slotfillers, as they are typically relatively brief nounphrases, and instantiation of a slot implies adegree of semantic lassification.
On the otherhand, one might find that higher quality isrequired in order to take translated phrases outof their original context.
Another question ishow to automate the construction of bilinguallexicons.
An important issue here will be howto combine information from different sources,given that automatically acquired lexicalinformation is apt to be less reliable, thoughdomain-specific.AcknowledgementsOur thanks go to Richard Kittredge and TanyaKorelsky for helpful comments and advice.
