Kaplan,1973) to produce the interface trees of the abstract inter-lingual representation.
These trees serve as input to syn-thesis, where they are reazTan~ed into valid surface structur-es fo r  the  ta rget  ~age.The source text  i s  t rans la ted  sentence by sentence  (orequ iva lent ) .

Morpho-log ica l  rules form a finlte-state grammar of affix-strlppingrules (?A rules') and the output is a chart with labelledarcs indicating lexical item and possible interpretation ofstripped affixes, as confirmed by dictionary look-up.
Themorphological analysis phase also creates a temporary "sent-ence dlctionary~ consistin~ of copies of the dictionary entr-ies for (only) those lexical items found in the currentt rans la t ion  un i t .The char t  then undergoes a two-s ta~e eyntact i co~semant -io  an~ys is .

In the second stage, the tree structure impliedby the labels and traces on these arcs is disjoined from the~aph and undergoes general tree-to-tree-transduction rules("T z~les') resulting in a single tree structure representingthe canon ica l  form of the t rans la t ion  un i t .

The system essentially has one large multillngual diction-ary from which numerous software packages generate varioussubdlctionarles as required either in the translation processitself, or for lexloographers working on the system.
Alpha-betioal or other structured language-speciflc listings can beproduced, while of course dictionary updating and editingpack~es are also provided.~ Implementation detailsThe system will run on any microprocessor system whichruns under the CP/M operating system and at C.0.L.
