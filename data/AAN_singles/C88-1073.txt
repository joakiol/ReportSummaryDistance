INSTANTIATIONS AND (OBLIGATORY VS.
OPTIONAL) ACTANTSJfirgen KUNZECentral Institute of LinguisticsAcademy of Sciences of the GDRPrenzlauer Promenade I@9-152BerlinDDR-1100Abstract: A formalism for ~he representationof "semantic emphases" is introduced, usingprincipal and accessory instantiatiQns.
Itm~es  it possible to convert predicate ex-pressions inbo network-like structures.
Asan application criteria for ooligatory andoptional actants are dealt with.I.
The formal framework- A set X of objects, denoted by x, y, Zo- A set E of events, states, actions, ...,denoted by el, e2, ....- A set L of places, denoted by 11, 12, ....- A set T of intervals (span~or moments) onthe time axis, denoted by tl, t2, ....- A se~ of functions f1' f2' ..o, which aremappings between the sets X, E, L and T.- A se~ of relaUions in E, L and T as e. g.e I ~e  2 (e I is a partial event, ... of e2J11 ~ 12, t I ~ t2, t I starts t2,t I finishes t 2 etco (Allen (1984); Bier-winch (1988) for the general framework).- Finally a set of primitive semantic predl-cares BI, B2, .o., ~hat may have as argu-ments elements of X, L and T as well aspropositions A, ioe .
predicates B wluhtheir (aopropriate) arguments.While ~he elements of the first four setshave the character of variables, the func-tions, relations and predicates are fixedand interpreted in a characteristic way.We use here the following functions:loc(e) = l: The location of e is 1.~ime(e) = t: The time of e is toIf e is a path, one may define Init(e) = e'and fln(e) = e" (cf.
Bierwisch 41988)).
Onehas time(inlt(e)) starts time(e) etc.We will use the following predicates:ACT(x) CAUSE(A 1 ,A 2)HAVE(x,y) CHANGE(A1,A2) (from A I ~o A 2)NOT (A) aT( A I , A 2) ( o onj unct i on)BECome(A) d~f CHANGE(NOT(A),A)On the basis of these formal componentsone has to give a definition of wellformedexpressions.
One needs furthermore an axiomsystem expressing the fundamental propertiesof the predicates.
We skip this here?2.
InstaatiationsFor each proposition A we assume an addi-tlonal argument place that is fi l led in by anelement e of Eo We say that "e is an Instan-tiation of A" or "e instantiates A" and writeA~\ ]  (Bierwisch (1988), Reichenbach (19#8))oWe introduce here a distinction betweentwo types of Instantiations, namely- principal instantiations, representing asemantic emphasis, denoted by e p,- accessory instantlations, denoted by eaoFor each primitive predicate in a giveninventory one Instantiatlon rule has to beformulated.
The rules are applied recurslvelyand provide a means for "calculating" theInstantlations for complex propositions.
Theresults are network-like structures consistqing of conditions only on the level of thesets X, E, L and T.ACT(x) Is\]| e is an action of x.HAVE(x,y)\[e\] , e is a state, that involvesx's having (owning, ...) of yoNOT(A) \[e\]$ a condition, that implies ~.&~e\].It should be note~ that for concrete A's con-crete rules can be formulated (preservingpresuppositions and certain arguments).In the next rules the index i = 1,2 indi-cates whether the first or the second argumen~yields the principal Instantlation.
For theindex j = 1,2 we use ~he convention "j ?
i"oCAUSEi(A1,A a) \[e\] :(e is a pair (el,e2)) ^ (A l \ [e~)  ^ (A2\[e2\]) ^(e I causes e2) ^ (e i = e p) A (ej = e a) ^(tlme(el) = tlme(e2) = time(e)) ^(loc(e I) = loc(e 2) = lot(e))This is the rule for simultaneous causation356where one has unity of time and place.CH~NGEi(A1,A2)\[e\]:(~ is a path) A( init(e) = el) ^ (fin(e) = e2)A(~21(AI,NOT(A~)) \[e~ ^  ET'(Aj,NOT(AI)) \[ej\](e l  = ep) A (e~ = e a)This preserves the semantic emphasis on A iand allows a new index for the second ~\]T.From this rule one obtains the conditions forB~O 1(A) = CHANGE 1(NOT(A), A) (=CFASE(NOT(A) ) )B\]6C2(A) = CHANGE2(NOT(A),A) (usual  BEC(A)).Note thai; ETk(A,A)\[e\] eq A\[eJ for all k, Aand e, BEC has one "degree of freedom" lessoETi(A 1 ~A 2 ) e :(e i = e ) A(  j = )^(time(el) = time(e2) = time(e))This way )~T becomes an unsymmetric predicate?3o Instanl;iations and actantsWe illust:eate the notions defined above by asample of German verbs with three necessaryactants: the source x, the goal z, end the(transferred) Object y.
Under some simplifi-cations we may assume the following expres-slon-scheme as basic pattern for this group:( 1 ) O,~s~fl/a(ACT(x/z),CHANGE1/2(HAV~(x,y),HAVE(z,y)))In (1) 16 expressions are summarized, whichone may obtain by choosing the upper indexof CAUSE, the argument of AOT, the upper In-dex of CH~GE and the upper index of the sec-ond occurrence of ~ in the CHANGEi-~le.An occurrence of a predicate in an expres-sion representing a certain sememe is calledan inhere~:,.t occurrence, if this occurrencehas to be instantiated for a sufficlen~ de-scriptlon of ~hls sememe.
The inherent occur~fences have to fulfil some condi~ionslThe inheren~ occurrences ~e closed underprincipal instantiations: If B(..o,A,..o)is an i~herent  occurrence of B, and thepredicate A yleids the principal insian-tia~ion of B, then the uppermost predicateof A is an inherent occurrence?The Inheren~ occurrences are closed bottom-up: if :In B(?..,A,...)
the occurrence @fthe upper.mos~ predicate of A is inherent,then th~ occurrence of B is ~mherentoin (I) it is sufficient to mark (after thelri~stan~ia~:\[e~) both occurrences of ET as pri-ma~ely i~1~rent occurrences (i. e. init(e)a~d fln(e) are necessary).
For co~cre~e some-mes one may add further inherent occurrencesin accordance with the afore~said conditions.The possibil it ies depend on the distributionof principal instantiationsoEach element of X occurring in an expres-sion a role can be assigned tos- ACT( ) defines in (I) the role "agent".By spelling out the second argument of CAUSEin (1) without the details of Instantlatlonswe obtain four partial conditions:HAVE(x,y) \[inlt(e)\] A NOT(HAVE(z,y)) \[init(e)\]NOT(HAVE(x,y)) \[fln(e)\] A HAVE(z,y) \[fin(e)\]Here e is the instantiation of CHANGE.- The occurrences of x in the first and thethird partial expression define togetherthe role "source" for Xo- The occurrences of z in the second and thefourth partial expression define togetherthe role "goal" for Zo- The occurrences of y in the first and thefourth partial expression define togetherthe role "object" for y.In this sense we may speak of role defin-ing occurrences.
They are independent of thedistribution of the hypes of insbantiations.Now we are able to formulate the follow-ing principle:(2) An actant is obligatory in a certain roleiff all its defining occurrences forthis role are direct arguments in inher-ent occurrences of predicates.In order to avoid mixing up surface anddeep phenomena one should note thaS the argu-ments of ACT in (1) for the verbs consideredunder A.
~ H. are subjects (in active voice)and hence "obligatory".
This assigmnent pre-dominates over (2) in passive voice, too: InC. the aciant z e. g. is according to (2) ob-ligatory as goal and agent, but being thesubject in active voice, not obligatory inpassive voice.
The same applies for the sub-jects in passive voice.In (3) we list the first eight possibil i-ties of (1) with the following abbreviationsin the corresponding columns:1. upper index of CAUSE2o argument 9f ACT3 .
upper index of CHANGE and the first ET4.
upper index of the second ET5.

and E. and between D. and H.),- the  pre f ixes ,  fo rming  three  types  ( " f rom" ,"over"  and " to"  except  be - ,  ve t - ,  o .o ) .In  German ex is ts  a r i ch  system of  p re f txuder ivat ives  in  th i s  group,  the i r  deta i ledexamination confirmes the distinctionsproposed here.
Verbs like Gbernehme~ (tak~over) or ~bcrgeben, Gberreichen (banove___~r) belong to both from-to-cases A. andD.
or E. and H., respectively?The remaining eight cases (upper index ofCAUSE is 2) represent the passive voice ofA.
- H. a~d some other verbs, e. g.H~ bekommen, erhalten (receiv_~e)(15) Die Kinder bekamen (yon Hans) Spielzeug0The distribution (x)y(z) (under 5.)
turnsinto (x)y z (under (7.).
For these verbs thepassive voice is impossible?Just the basic verbs nehmen and eb~ (andsome more, e. g. fibergeben) do not meet thescheme in every detail: They may occupy sev~eral positions of show a different distri-bution or optional ao~ants.
It goes withouts~ylng that for many of the considered verbsthe expression (I) has to be specified, i. eoHAVE is too general.
Moreover stealln~ isagainst the law, presentlng is connectedwith some benefit of z etc .

.The classification of this verb group isin keeping with Schumacher (1986), p. 72d froOther groups of verbs (e. g. "Informing"~mitteile~, oo., e rfahren) have been dealtwith the same way.
Pairs of the type ~o fillthe bottle with wate~r and to fill water i~othe bottle Field another confirmation ofthis formal approach.ReferencesAllen, James F. (198~) Towards a GeneralTheoryof  Action and Time.
