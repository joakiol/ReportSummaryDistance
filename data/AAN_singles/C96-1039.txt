twAbstractVarious strategies are proposed to identifyand classify three types of proper nouns inChinese texts.
Clues from character,sentence and paragraph levels are employedto resolve Chinese personal names.Character, Syllable and FrequencyConditions are presented to treattransliterated personal names, To deal withorganization ames, keywords, prefix, wordassociation and parts-of-speech are applied.For fair evaluation, large scale test data areselected from six sections of a newspaper.The precision and the recall for these threetypes are (88.04%, 92.56%), (50.62%,71.93%) and (61.79%, 54.50%), respectively.When the former two types are regarded as acategory, the performance becomes (81.46%,91.22%).
Compared with other approaches,our approach as better performance and ourclassification is automatic.1.
IntroductionA Chinese sentence is composed of a string ofcharacters without any word boundaries, so that tosegment Chinese sentences is indispensable inChinese language processing (Chen, 1990; Chen,1994).
Many word segmentation techniques (Chen& Liu, 1992; Chiang et al, 1992; Sproat & Shih,1990) have been developed.
However, theresolution of unknown words, i.e., those words notin the dictionaries, form the bottleneck.
Somepapers (Fung & Wu, 1994; Wang et al, 1994) basedon Smadja's paradigm (1993) learned an aideddictionary from a corpus to reduce the possibility ofunknown words.
Chang et al (1992) proposed amethod to extract Chinese personal names from an11,000-word corpus, and reported 91.87% precisionand 80.67% recall.
Wang et al (1992) recognizedunregistered names on the basis of titles and asurname-driven rule.
L inet  al.
(1993) presented amodel to tackle a very restrictive form of unknownwords.
Sproat et al (1994) considered Chinesepersonal names and transliterations of foreign words.Their performance was 61.83% precision and80.99% recall on an 12,000-Chinese-charactercorpus.This paper deals with three kinds of propernouns - say, Chinese personal names, transliteratedpersonal names and organization ames.
We notonly tell if an unknown word is a proper noun, butalso assign it a suitable semantic feature.
In otherwords, '~?~4~ ~' (George Bush) will have a featureof male transliterated personal name when it isidentified.
Such a rigid treatment will be helpful forfurther applications uch as anaphora resolution(Chen, 1992), sentence alignment (Chert & Chert,1994; Chen& Wu, 1995), etc.
Section 2 describesthe training corpora nd the testing corpus we used.Sections 3, 4 and 5 propose tile identification andclassification methods of Chinese personal names,transliterated personal names and organizationnames, respectively.
Section 6 presents twoapplications.
Section 7 concludes the remarks.2.
Training Corpora and Testing CorpusThe proposed methods in this paper integrate therule-based and the statistics-based models, so thattraining corpora are needed.
To test theperformance of language models, a good testingcorpus is also necessary.
This section introduces allthe corpora that are used in the following sections.NTU balanced corpus, which follows thestandard of LOB corpus (Johansson, 1986), is thefirst training corpus.
It is segmented by a wordsegmentation system and is checked manually.
Intotal, this corpus has 113,647 words and 191,173characters.The second training corpus is extracted fromthree newspaper corpora (China Times, LibertyTimes News and United Daily News).
It is justsegmented by a word segmentation system withoutchecking manually.
Although segmentation errorsmay exist, this corpus is 23.2 times larger than NTUbalanced corpus, so that we can get more reliableword association pairs.The third training corpus is a transliteratedpersonal name corpus.
There are 2,692transliterated personal names, including 1,414male's names and 1,278 female's names.
Thosetransliterated personal names are selected from abook "English Names For Yon" (Huang, 1992).The last training data is a Chinese personal namecorpus.
It has 219,738 Chinese personal names and661,512 characters.222Finally, the testing corpus is introduced.
Werandomly select six different sections from anewspaper corpus (Liberty Times News).
Thecontents are different from the second trainingcorpus.
The following shows the statistics of thetesting corpus:(a) the political sectionThere are many items of news about thelegislature.
It includes 23,695 words and36,059 characters.
(b) the social sectionThere are many items of news about policeand offenders.
It includes 61,846 words and90,011 characters.
(c) the entertainment sectionThere are many items of news about TV stars,programs, and so on.
It includes 38,234words and 55,459 characters.
(d) the international sectionIt contains many items of foreign news andhas 19,049 words and 29,331 characters.
(e) the economic sectionMany items of news about stock market,money, and so on, are recorded.
It includes39,008 words and 54,124 characters.
(f) the sports sectionAll items of news concern sports.
It includes36,971 words and 54,124 characters.Every section has its own characteristics.
In thepolitical section, there are many titles.
In the socialsection and the entertainment ~ection, there aremany Chinese personal names and organizationnames.
In the international section, transliteratedpersonal names are more than the other two.
In theeconomic section, stock companies often appear.
Inthe sports section, there are many Chinese personalnames and transliterated personal names.
Becausethe proper nouns are usually segmented into singlecharacters, they will interfere with one anotherduring identification and classification.3.
Chinese Personal Names3.1 Structure of Personal NamesChinese personal names are composed of surnamesand names.
Most Chinese surnames are singlecharacter and some rare ones are two characters.The following shows three different ypes:(a) Single character like '~ ' ,  }~', '~ '  and '-9:-'.
(b) Two characters like '~ \ [~ '  and'  k'(('.
(c) Two surnames together like ' J I ,~' .Most names are two characters and some rare onesare one character.
Theoretically, every charactercan be considered as names rather than a fixed set.Thus the length of Chinese personal names rangesfrom 2 to 6 characters.3.2 Strategies3.2.1 Segmentation before Identif icationInput text has to be segmented roughly beforehand.This is because many characters have highprobabilities to be a Chinese personal name withoutpre-segmentation.
Consider the example '~!,)~l~,@~l+j(@~l~...'.
The character '(i@' has a high score to bea surname.
In this aspect, '~)~'  is easy to be aname.
If the input text is not segmented beforehand,it is easy to regard '(q~.~J~' as a Chinese personalname.
On the statistical model, this type of errors isdifficult to avoid.
However, it is easy to capture bypre-segmentation.3.2.2 Variation of a CharacterHow to calculate the score of a candidate is animportant issue in this identification system.
Thepaper (Chang et al, 1992) proposes the followingformula:(I) P(W,GN) = P(GN) * P(WIGN )This formula has a drawback, i.e., it does notconsider the probability of a character to be theother words rather than a surname.
Take the twocharacters '{,~,~' and 'llil\[' as an example.
Thecharacter '{'~j.'
can form '{~' ,  '1",1/~ ', 'l"~/-iiTfi ', andmany other words.
On the contrary, the character'I@i' just forms a word '@\[1~', which is a rare word.The difference shows that the former is easier to beused as the other words than the latter.
The aboveformula assigns the same score to '@/:-~' and '@\[(-~',when '{'0?'
and '111~' have the same frequency to benames.
Intuitively, '{~lj.~'-'.'
does not look like a name,but 'ItlJU~.'
does.
Thus 'tliI(' should have higher scorethan '{~l', and the variation of a character should beconsidered in the formula.
In our model, thevariation of characters is learned from NTUbalanced corpus.3.2.3 Baseline ModelEquation (2) defines the original formula.
Theformula used to calculate P(Ci) is similar toEquation (1).
When the variation of a character isconsidered, Equation (3) is formulated.
Thevariation of a character is measured by the inverseof the frequency of the character to be the otherwords.
Equation (4) is simplified from Equation (3).
(2) 1'(C1) x P(C2) x P(C3)1 l 1(3) P(CI)  x - -  x t'(C2) x - -  x P(C3) x -~ - -& Cl & C2 & C3# CI # C2 # C3(4) - -  x - -  ?
- -&C I  &(72 &C3where Ci is a character in the input sentence,P(Ci) is the probability of Ci to be asurname or a name,#Ci is the frequency of Ci to be a surnameor a name,223&Ci is the frequency of Ci to contain intile other words.For different ypes of surnames, different models areadopted.
(a) Single character# CI # C2 # C3(5) - -  x - -  x - -  > Threxholdl& CI & ('2 & C3#C1(6) - - ->  ThreshoM2& (71# (_72 # C3and - -  x - -  > Threshold3& (72 & (73(b) Two characters# C2 # (;3(7) - -  ?

- -  > 7hreshoM6& C11 & C12# C2 # C3and - - -x  - - -  > 7hreshoM7&C2 &C3Because the surnames w~th two characters arealways surnames, Model (b) neglects the score ofsurname part.
Models (a) and (c) have two scorefunctions.
It avoids the problem of very high scoreof surnames.
Consider the string '1~ ; ' i t (  ")j~J '\[".4:J ( J~  @<-".
Because of the high scores of thecharacters '1~' and 'S,', '\[~N~} f ' , '  f:, -NI', ' t:,~:J - 2"and 'J{~ -~ '  may be identified according toEquation (5).
Equation (6) screens out theimpossible candidates.
The above three models canbe extended to single-character names.
When acandidate cannot pass the threshold, its lastcharacter is cut off and the remaining part is triedagain.
The threshold is different from the originalone.
Thresholds are trained from Chinese personalname corpus.
We calculate the score of everyChinese personal name in the corpus using theabove formulas.
The scores for each formula aresorted and the one which is less than 99% of thepersonal names is considered as a threshold for thisfornmla.
That is, 99% of the training data can passthe threshold.3 .2 .4  Other  C luesText provides many useful clues from three differentlevels - say, character, sentence and paragraphlevels.
The baseline model forms the first level, i.e.,character level.
The following subsections presentother clues.
Of these, gender is also a clue fromcharacter level; title, mutual information andpunctuation marks come from sentence level; tileparagraph information is recorded in cache.3.2.4.1 Clue 1: Title The first is title.
Wang et a/.
(1992) propose a model based on titles When atitle appears before (after) a candidate, it is probablya personal name.
For example, '~ .
-~)N I~,  ' and '~,~ ~)'~ :~, ~.
~\]( '  However, there are many~!~,~ \[ J Thus counterexamples, e.g., ' ~'  ' ; (~ ~"-4 :~'~ ~ ' f'J " s' :  Y ' .
, .
,we cannot make sure if the characters urrounding atitle form a personal name.
Even so, title is still auseful clue.
it can help determine the boundary of aname.
In the example '~.J~J!~'~;~;:i-qj...',' ~-IDJ!SJ'~I~, '' isidentified incorrectly.
When a title is included inthis example, i.e., '~JDJ!~!I~',;I~'~;IJ... ', the error doesnot occur.
In sumnmry, if a title appears, a specialbonus is given to the candidate3.2.4.2 Clue 2: Mutual hfformation Chinesepersonal names are not always composed of singlecharacters.
For example, the name part of thesentence 'l~i~rl)Jv~Jlai~lc'/;~'r~';jtlfj' is a word.
How totell out that a word is a content word or a name isindispensable.
Mutual information (Church &Hanks, 1990) provides a measure of wordassociation.
The words surrounding a wordcandidate are checked.
When there exists a strongrelationship, the word candidate has highprobability to be a content word.
In the example '1~~!
J :~ l ' /  ' ,~<~Jl~?_~., . '
,  the two words "C I!!
:"and '~.~ \[tl' have high mutual reformation, so that 'lI~, i1~' is not a personal name.
Three newspapercorpora (total size is about 2.6 million words) areused to train the word association.3.2.4.3 Clue 3: Punctuation Marks Personalnames usually appear at the head or the tail of asentence.
A candidate is given an extra bonus whenit is found from these two places.
Candidatessurrounding the caesura mark, a Chinese-specificpunctuation mark, are treated in the similar way.
Ifsome words around this punctuation are personalnames, the others are given bonus.3.2.4.4 Clue 4: Gender There is a special customin Chinese.
A married woman may mark herhusband's urname before her surname.
That formstype 3 personal name mentioned in Section 3.1,Because a surname may be considered as a name,e.g., '7/'  in the personal name ~'~'/~Jt~ and in,~,~r/,-, v .
the candidates with two tile personal name c~ ,,~,,possible surnames do not always belong to type 3personal name.
The gender information, i.e., type 3is always a female, helps us disambiguate he type ofpersonal names.
Some Chinese characters havehigh score for male and some for female.
Thefollowing lists some typical examples:male: ~ ,  ,~, ~,", ~t~,-1t(, ~j~, J?J(~, 9~i, JI(, (~l,)~;female: ~i~, J~, I~, ~l l, ~:~, ~;, {}::, '{~L ~Y, )J:, -+-/224We count the frequencies of the characters to bemale and female, and compare these two scores.
Ifthe former is larger than the latter, then it is amasculine name.
Otherwise, it is a fenfinine name.3.2.4.5 Clue 5: Cache A personal name mayappear lnore than once in a paragraph Thisphenomenon is useful durmg identification We usecache to store the identified candidates, and resetcache when next paragraph is considered There arefour cases shown below when cache is used:(a) CIC2C3 and C1C2C4 are in the cache, andC I C2 is correct.
(b) CIC2C3 and C1C2C4 are in the cache, andboth are correct.
(c) CIC2C3 and C1C2 are in the cache, andC 1 C2C3 is correct.
(d) C1C2C3 and C1C2 are in the cache, andCIC2 is correct.Here Ci denotes a Chinese character.
It is obviousthat case (a) contradicts with case (b).
Consider thestring '5J~J!i}'i;~,'J,)-}:jl','lif~:'j: ~l;~'.
A personal ,mum '~!ID\]J?
;;\[~, '' is recognized.
When another string '}<-I~lJl})~.~lt/Jxq':?lJI,.
';'_~')'l'lili~,t~' is input, '~,~llllfA)~' and 'Tlldx>l ":'are identified Then we find the two strings '/}'i.J~\]}~)~,' and ' +'iJ~\]J'.~;a:'lY/' re similar.
Here case (a) is correct.However, case (b) also appears very often innewspapers.
For example, 'l~lL,kT~ " J~l~J'gfJ~iH~ hi I,~3...L Two personal names, 'li\[\]/k:~'~/ and 'lT\[~\]Kgt?
'are identified In the examples like '~.~t~\[<gif~ "~.
.
. '
and '... ~ .~ o ', two candidates '~.~;{~t~, ' and '}'#~' will be identified.
That belon~ to case (d).Consider the last examples '11',(,1 i*l 1~,1:<..' and '~,(,i~l l~g, rii:j.dz... ' Two candidates '~,({~ i' and '~',(,~" i~l I'will be identified too.
Now, case (c) is adopted.in our treatment, a weight is assigned to eachentry in the cache.
The entry which has clear rightboundary has a high weight.
Title and punctuationare chics for boundary.
For those similar pairswhich have different weights, the entry having highweight is selected.
If both have high weights, bothare chosen.
When both have low weights, the scoreof the second character of a name part is critical.
Itaetermiues if the character is kept or deleted.3.3 Exper iments  and  D iscuss ionsTable l stunmarlzes the identification results ofChinese personal names.
Total Chinese personalnames in each section are listed in Cohlnm 2.Cohmm 3 shows the precision and the recall of thebaseline model.
The overall performance is goodexcept for section 4 (the international section) andsection 5 (the economic section).
The remainingcolunms demonstrate the change of performanceafter the clues discussed m Section 3.2 areconsidered incrementally.
If name part of acandidate is a word, word association is used tomeasure the relationship between the surrotmdingwords.
The increase of the precision in Cohmm 4verifies this idea.
Theoretically, it shottld notdecrease the recall.
After checking the result, wefind that some unreasonable word association comesfrom the training corpus.
Recall that it is generatedby a rough word segmentation system wlthoulmanually-checking.
The next clue is punctuation.The idea is that the candidates m the beginning orat the end of sentences have larger probabilities tobe personal names than they are in other places.
Ithelps some candidates with lower score to pass thethreshold, but it cannot avoid the incorrectcandidates to pass the threshold Thus, theperformance is dangling.
Then, title is consideredThe increase of the recall shows that title works wellBut it decreases the precision too.
From thevariation of the performance, we know that cache ispowerful.
Both the recall and the precismn increase.Finally, gender is joined It is used when twosuccess ive  characters are candidates of surnames.In other words, it focuses on type 3 personal names.Almost all type 3 personal names are identifiedcorrectly.
Because this type of personal names israre in the testing newspaper corpus, the variation isnot large.
Table 1 shows that our model is goodexcept for section 4 and section 5.
There are manyproper nouns in the international section, andahnost all of them are not included m the dictionary.All unknown words disturb one another insegmentation.
For example, ' q!ilI?~J~0,' is a countiyname.
It is divided into three single characters byour word segmentation system.
From the viewpointof personal nmne identification, it is easy to regard 'lI,"r~J~ff as a Chinese personal name.
Another sourceof errors is foreign names.
Some of them aresimilar to Chinese personal names, e.g., '~'~!Ui}/i:'and ' <t&jE'.Table 1.

Thecompany name '~\]~\]i)t' is a typical example.
Insummary, there are three major errors.
One isforeign name.
They are identified as proper nounscorrectly, but are assigned wrong features.
About20% of errors belong to this type.
The second typeof errors results from the rare surnames, which arenot included in the surname table.
Some raresurnames are not real surnames.
They are justartists' stage names.
Near 14% of errors come fromthis type.
The other errors include place names,organization ames, and so on.4.
Transliterated Personal Names4.1 Structure of Personal NamesCompared with the ideniification of Chinesepersonal names, the identification of transliteratedpersonal names has the following difficulties:(a) No specific clue like surnames in Chinesepersonal names to trigger the identification system.
(b) No restriction on the length Of atransliterated personal name.
It may be composedof a single character or more, e.g., '5%', '~'i'\]d', "~ ' i~Y', '~ .
f  ~':'}~-' and 'd\[if,~ \ ]~1\ ] '(c) No large scale transliterated personal namecorpus.
(d) Ambiguity in classification.For example, ' J~)~'  may denote a city or aformer American president.4.2 S t ra teg ies4.2.1 Basic IdeaAlmost all foreign names are in transliteration, otin translation.
And the base of transliteration ispronunciation of foreign names.
Pronunciation iscomposed of syllables and tones.
The majordifference of pronunciation between Chinese andEnglish is syllables.
The style of syllabic order isspecific in transliteration.
Consider an example.The transliterated personal name ,~\ ]z~}.
hassyllables 'Y  ~',7-- ~zv  T - -  ( (~ ' .
Such asyllabic order is rare in Chinese, but is not specialfor a transliterated string.
In other words, thesyllabic orders of transliterated strings and generalChinese strings are not similar.
Besides, atransliterated name consists of a string of singlecharacters after segmentation.
That is, thesecharacters cannot be put together.
However, theunrestrictive length of transliterated names andhomophones in Chinese result in the need of verylarge training corpus.
The following sections howhow to modify the basic idea if a large scale corpusis not available.4.2.2 Character  ConditionWhen a foreign name is transliterated, the selectionof homophones i restrictive.
Consider an exampleshown below:Richard Macs ~ l l \ [~ l )~ ~ , ~ ,  ,~Those strings following English names have thesame pronunciations.
The first is usually adopted,and the second is never used.
It shows that thecharacters used in transliteration are selected fromsome character set.
In our model, total 483characters are trained from our transliteratedpersonal name corpus.
They play the similar role ofthe surnames in the identification of Chinesepersonal names.
If all the characters in a stringbelong to this set, i.e., they satisfy charactercondition, they are regarded as a candidate.4.2.3 Sy l lab le  ConditionBecause of the unrestrictive l ngth of transliteratednames, how to identify their boundary is a problem.Of course, titles and punctuation used in last sectioncan be adopted too.
But they do not always appearin the text.
Thus another clue should be found.Syllable order may be a clue.
Those examples like '~r~' ,  '~' J , , '  and ' ~ '  which meet the charactercondition do not look like transliterated namesbecause their pronunciations are not like foreignnames.
If there is a large enough transliteratedname corpus, the syllable orders can be learned.However, our transliterated corpus only contain2692 personal names.
Thus only the first and thelast characters are considered.
For each candidate,we check the syllable of the first (the last) character.If the syllable does not belong to the training corpus,the character is deleted.
The remaining charactersare treated in the similar way.4.2,4 F requency  ConditionAs mentioned in Section 3.2.3, the frequency of acharacter to be a part of a personal name isimportant information.
The concept may be usedhere.
However, only large scale transliteratedpersonal name corpus can give reliable statisticaldata.
Based on our small training corpus, the rangeof the application of the information should benarrowed own.
We only apply it in a candidate oflength 2.
This is because it is easy to satisfy thecharacter condition for candidates of the shortestlength.
For each candidate which has only twocharacters, we compute the frequency of these twocharacters to see if it is larger than a threshold.
If itis not, it is eliminated.
The threshold is determinedin the similar way as Section 3.2.3.4.3 Experiments and DiscussionsThe identification system scans a segnlentedsentence from left to right.
It finds the characterstring that meets the character condition, syllablecondition and frequency condition.
Table 2 shows226Table 2.

However, sections 2 and 5(lhe social and the economic sections) have badprecision.
The average recall tells us that thetri,g~ger to the identification system is nsefnl.
Thereasons why the recall is not good enough are: sometransliterated personal names (e.g., '?,~Oi~'j ~'and '~D{$~') look like Chinese personal names, and theidentification of Chinese personal names is donebefore that of transliterated personal names.Although they are correctly identified as personalnames, they are assigned wrong features.
Similarly,transliterated nouns like popular brands ofautomobiles ('7\[~\[!~,'i:' and "l\[~,)l~|~j'), Chinese propernouns (' ~I\] ~ '  ' ~.J:x)~' and '?t'~ II~') and Chinesepersonal names ( '~  I:~l\]') look like transliteratedpersonal nmnes.
That decreases the precision.f~esides these types of nouns, boundary errors affectthe precision 1oo.
For telling out the error ratesfrom classification, we made another experiment.
Ifthe identified results are not classified, the averageprecision is 81.46% and the average recall is91.22%.5.
Organization Names5.1 Structures of Organization NamesStructures of organization ames are more complexthan those of personal names.
Some organizationnames are composed of proper nouns and contentr~-ILIII~H,J is made up of words.
For exmnple, '~" '" " ~:'the place name 'T' ?
;\[\[; fii' and the content word '~t~',J-'.A personal nmne can also be combined a contentword to form an organization ame, e.g., '~t,7~l I~1~i~\[ ii~ PJi '.
Some organization names look likepersonal names, e.g., '\[j\[~)t'.
Some organizationnames are composed of several related words.
Forexample, '7~ II~ ~ ~ ~ "b~i, 3,~ ~ ~'  contains fourwords %'~11~', '~'c': ' ,  '~ '  and '3 ,~ ' .
Severalsingle-character words can also form anorganization name, e.g., ' JWt J~ ii~ ~ '.
Someorganization names have nested structures.Consider the string: '~l"~,~7;~lIfi~ ~?~,~ ?
, i~/J~?\[t'.
The group '~i J~/ J \~\[ l '  is a part of thecommittee ,x~.~.~q- , ,  and the committee itself isa part of '~I;~3~i~II~,;5'.
Such complex structuresmake identification of organization names verydifficult.Basically, a complete organization ame can bedivided into two parts: name and keyword.
In the'-~" l ' i  ' ':' i l-I\[~rtl is a name, and '1l~ example i i-Il  I ~f:~f'l, "~" ' "/I~J:' is a keyword.
Many words can serve as names,but only some fixed words can be regarded askeywords.
Thus, keyword ix an important clue toidentify the organizations.
However, there are stillseveral difficult problems.
First, keyword is usuallya common content word.
It is not easy to tell out akeyword and a content word.
Second, a keywordmay appear m the abbreviated form.
For exmnple, '.\]~i~i' x an incomplete keyword of '?~:~i?ill~l~, r\]'.Third, the keyword may be omitted completely.
Forexample, '~_~),~' (Acer).
The following shows tworough classifications, and discusses their feattues.
( l)  Complete organization ames(a) Structure: This type of organizationnames is usually composed of proper nouns andkeywords.
(b) Length: Some organization names arevery long, so it is hard to decide their length.Fortunately, only some keyword like 'l iil ~ J.~", ' ~ ~' ,'3,~,~,:~', '~\[\[,~I~', mid so on, have this problem.
(c) Ambiguity: Some organization nameswith keywords are still mnbiguous.
For exmnple, 'X l" ~(~ ii,~:,' and '1\[~, '~ ' .
They usually denotereading matters, but not organizations.
However, ifthey are used in some contexts, e.g., "~ l"~f::il;~,~ ~~f!
J3t\[" and " l\[~, ~ ~\[~ (l~( ~lf )~ ", they should beinterpreted as organizations.
(2) Incomplete organization ames(a) Structure: These organization namesoften omit their keywords.
(b) Ambiguity: The abbreviated organizationnames may be ambiguous.
For example, '~t!,~($', '~~ ' , '  ,~,.,~!~' and ' /~ ' / "  .

.
L  - are famous sport teams mTaiwm~ or in U.S.A., however, they are also generalcontent words.5.2 StrategiesThis section introduces ome strategies used in theidentification.
Keyword is a good indicator for anidentification system.
It plays the similar role ofsurnames.
Keyword shows not only the possibility227Table 3.

For each sentence, we scan itfrom left to right to find keywords.
Becausekeyword is a general content word, we need otherstrategies to tell out its exact meaning.
Thesestrategies also have the capabilities to detect the leftboundary if there is an organization ame.Prefix is a good marker for possible leftboundary.
For example, '\[,,~I~Z' (National), '~(~qL'(Provincial), '~\]~ qi?
(Private), and so on.
The namepart of an organization may be forlned by singlecharacters or words.
These two cases are discussedas follows.
(a) single charactersAfter segmentation, there nmy be a sequenceof single characters preceding a possible keywordThe character may exist independently.
That is, it isa single-character word.
In this case, the contentword is not a keyword, so that no organization ameis found If these characters cannot existindependently, they form the name part of anorganization.
The left boundary of the organizationis determined by the following rule:We insert a single character to the name partuntil a word is met.
(b) word(s)Here, a word is composed of at least twocharacters.
If the word preceding the possiblekeyword is a place name or a personal name, thenthe word forms the name part of an organization.Otherwise, we use word association model todetermine the left boundary.
The postulation is: thewords to compose a name part usually have strongrelationships.
The mutual information mentioned inSection 3.2.4.2 is also used to measure therelationship of two words.Part of speech is useful to determine the leftboundary of an organization.
The categories ofverbs are very typical.
The name part of anorganization cannot extend beyond a transitive verb.If a transitive verb precedes a possible keyword,then no organization ame is found.
Numeral andclassifier are also helpful.
For exan~ple, '~  HJ'(company) in '~f J .
.
. '
(three companies ...) isnot a keyword due to the critical parts of speech.Because a tagger is not involved beforeidentification, the part of speech of a word isdetermined wholly by lexical probability.5.3 Experiments and DiscussionsTable 3 shows the precision and the recall for everysection.
Section 4 (The International Section) hasbetter precision and recall than other files.
Mosterrors result from organization names withoutkeywords, e.g., ',~,=~fijL~' '~+I(6', /\:L~I~:~!~I, JL~J,and so on.
Even keywords appear, e.g., ' \ [ -r i J~r fJ'and '~r  ~ fi: ~-~', there may not always existorganization names.
Besides error candidates andorganization names without keywords, error leftboundary is also a problem.
Consider the exalnples:'~\[';~\['-'~!~.
:),t~' and f~-~' .
In the first, '~qS)'should not be included: and in the second, a word '3,~'~' is lost.6.
ApplicationsThe senmntic lassification of proper nouns is use fillin many applications.
Here, anaphora resolutionand sentence aligmnent are presented.
In general,pronoun often refers to the nearest proper noun(Chen, 1992).
But it is not always true.
Thefollowing shows a counter example:The first pronoun '1"1f~' (tie) refers to the personalname '-(~,~'.
It is a normal example.
The secondpronoun '~ '  (he) refers to the same person, but the'~ '~ '  ' ; i ;~.~!'.
nearest personal name is ?
~j -~ rather thanIf  we know the gender of every personal name, thenit is easy to tell out which person is referred, in theabove example, the gender of the Chinese pronouns'~\[~' (he) and '/t\[\[~' (she) is masculine and feminine,respectively; tim persons ':~'17:~ ' and '.1:~'~-~'~'!
'~' : ;'a, ~42~1'J\],-5?S arenmle and female, respectively.
Therefore, thecorrect referential relationships can be well-established.
In the experiment of the genderassignment, 3/4 of Chinese personal name corpus isregarded as training data, and the renmining l/4 isfor testing.
The correct rate is 89%.
Sentencealignment (Chen & Chen, 1994) is important in228setup of a bilingual corpus.
Personal name is one ofimportant clues.
Its use in aligning English-Chinese text is shown in the paper (Chen & Wu,1995\].7, Conc lud ing  RemarksThis paper proposes various strategies to identifyand classify Chinese proper nouns.
Theperfornmnce evahmtion criterion is very strict Notonly are the proper nouns identified, but alsosuitable features are assigned.
The perforlnance(precision, recall) for the identification of Chinesepersonal names, transliterated personal nmnes andorganization mnes is (88.04%, 92.56%), (50.62%,71.93%) and (61.79%, 54.50%), respectively.When the criterion is loosed a little, i.e., Chinesepersonal nmnes and transliterated personal namesare regarded as a category, the performance ~s(81.46%, 91.22%).
Compared with the approaches(Sproat et al, 1994: Fung & Wu, 1994: Wang et al,1994), we deal with more types of proper nouns andwe have better performance.Some difficult problems hould be tackled in theflmlre.
Foreign proper nouns may be transformed inpart by transliteration a d translation.
The example"George Town" is transformed into ':~'{{~J4~'.
Thecharacter 'b~' (town) results in translation and' fq:?
(((George) comes from transliteration.
Tlus problemis interesting and worthy of resolving.
Theperformance of identification of organization amesms not good enough, especially for those organizationnames without keywords.
It should be investigatedfurther.AcknowledgmentsThe research was supported in part by NationalScience Council, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.
