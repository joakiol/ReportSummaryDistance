Improving the Tagset for the Part-of-Speech-Tagging ofGerman Spoken DataSwantje WestpfahlInstitut f?r Deutsche Sprache, Mannheimwestpfahl@ids-mannheim.deAbstractPart-of-speech tagging (POS-tagging) of spoken data requires different means of annotationthan POS-tagging of written and edited texts.
In order to capture the features of German spo-ken language, a distinct tagset is needed to respond to the kinds of elements which only occurin speech.
In order to create such a coherent tagset the most prominent phenomena of spokenlanguage need to be analyzed, especially with respect to how they differ from written lan-guage.
First evaluations have shown that the most prominent cause (over 50%) of errors in theexisting automatized POS-tagging of transcripts of spoken German with the Stuttgart T?bingenTagset (STTS) and the treetagger was the inaccurate interpretation of speech particles.
Onereason for this is that this class of words is virtually absent from the current STTS.
This paperproposes a recategorization of the STTS in the field of speech particles based on distributionalfactors rather than semantics.
The ultimate aim is to create a comprehensive reference corpusof spoken German data for the global research community.
It is imperative that all phenomenaare reliably recorded in future part-of-speech tag labels.1 IntroductionIn the Institute for German Language (Institut f?r Deutsche Sprache, IDS Mannheim) a large referencecorpus of German spoken data is currently being built.
It already contains more than 100 hours of tran-scribed audio material, i.e.
about one million tokens.
The aim of my dissertation is to annotate the cor-pus with Part-of-Speech-tags (POS-tags) and thus to tackle the theoretical problems which originatefrom the differences between spoken and written language.
On the one hand, as the corpus is growingfast, ways must be found to automate this, i.e.
without manual correction.
On the other hand there areno tools to accomplish such a task at present.
First tests running the treetagger (Schmid 1995) with theStuttgart T?bingen Tagset (STTS) (Schiller et al.
1999), which on written data show an accuracy of97.53% (Schmid 1995) have shown that the accuracy of these tools on spoken data is far below ac-ceptable, i.e.
they only show an accuracy of 81.16% (Westpfahl and Schmidt 2013).
There are twomain reasons for this.
First of all, the structure of German spoken language is quite different from thestructure of German written language due to many elliptic structures, disruptions, repetitions etc.
Fur-thermore, punctuation is not annotated in the corpus; hence the algorithms have no ?proper sentences?to work with.As was shown in the studies of Westpfahl and Schmidt (2013) and Rehbein and Schalowski (2013),the mistakes in annotating POS-tags on German spoken language are due to a lack of suitable catego-ries in the tagset; namely categories which reflect the manifold speech particles, vernacular use of pro-nouns, verbs and items which are impossible to categorize grammatically.
As can be seen in Table 1, afirst analysis of tagging errors showed that more than 50% of the mistakes are due to mis-tagged dis-course markers, interjections and speech particles.
Hence, to reach the goal of an automatized POS-tagging, the tagset must firstly be adapted to those phenomena.
It is the aim of this paper to provide atheoretical foundation on how to comply with the need to re-categorize the existing tag set for speechparticles; creation of new tags and merging of existing tags are both proposed as seems relevant for theparticular data.
Problems which are due to verbs, pronouns and non-words cannot be discussed here.Table 1: Errors in POS annotation > 5% (Westpfahl and Schmidt 2013)Errors in POS annotation  > 5%Particles and interjections 51,59%Pronouns 13,43%Verbs 9,14%XY non words 8,18% ___________This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

English languagecorpora are for example the BNC (Burnard 2007), the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al.
1992), Vi-enna-Oxford International Corpus of English (VOICE) (VOICE 2013) and the Christine Corpus(Sampson 2000).
While both the Switchboard corpus and the BNC use POS tag-sets developed forwritten data, VOICE and the Christine corpus adapted theirs specifically for spoken language.
VOICEadded 26 POS tags to the Penn treebank POS tagset which include tags for, among others, discoursemarkers or response particles and also non-verbal elements like laughter and breathing.
The Christinecorpus uses a very fine grained tagset with more than 400 tags annotating morpho-syntactic as well asrich pragmatic information.A POS tagset which has been especially designed for a corpus of spoken language is the tagset ofthe Spoken Dutch Corpus (Oosterdijk 2000).
However, although the tagset consists of more than 300tags, all discourse related items are tagged as interjections.For the German language there is the T?bingen Treebank of Spoken German (T?Ba-D/S), whichuses the STTS with no alterations whatsoever (Telljohann et al.
2012).In order to find a solution on how to tag non-standard texts with the STTS, an interest group was setup in 2012.
Within this interest group a work group formed which especially focused their attention onthe adaption of the STTS for spoken language and computer mediated language (CMC), namely forthe corpora Kietz-Deutsch Corpus, the Dortmund chat corpus and our corpus (DGD2/FOLK).
As afirst result, three papers were published with some suggestions on which phenomena should be repre-sented in an adapted tagset (Rehbein and Schalowski 2013; Bartz et al.
2013; Westpfahl and Schmidt2013).
The present paper is meant to give an overview of a theoretical foundation on how to complywith the need to recategorize the tagset with respect to speech particles, as so far only a ?purely data-driven?
approach has been discussed (Rehbein and Schalowski 2013).3 Speech particles in the original STTSThe Stuttgart T?bingen Tagset (STTS) was conceptually developed for a corpus of newspaper arti-cles and only those classes of words which were frequently used were represented in the tagset.
There-fore, modal particles, speech particles or discourse markers were not at the center of attention of Schil-ler et al.
(1999) as their use in written texts is commonly understood to be 'bad style'.
To understandthe changes I have made in the tagset I shall first present the categories used for particles and dis-course markers in the original tagset:Table 2 categories for speech particles in the original STTSTags Description Example Literal English translationPTKVZ verbal particles [er gab] auf [he gave] upPTKZU particle used with infinitives zu [gehen] to [walk]PTKA particle used with adjectives or adverbs am [sch?nsten], zu [schnell] most [beautiful], too [fast]PTKNEG negation particle nicht notPTKANT response particles ja, nein, danke, bitte yes, no, thanks, pleaseITJ interjections mhm, ach, tja uhum, oh, wellAs one can see, the STTS is structured hierarchically; for particles, the basis tag would be "PTK"for "Partikel" and there are five subcategory tags.
Furthermore, the tagset provided one category forinterjections: ITJ, defining them after Bu?mann (1990) as words which serve to express emotions,swearing and curses and for getting in contact with others.
Formally they are invariable and syntacti-cally independent from the sentence as well as having, strictly speaking, no lexical meaning (Schilleret al.
1999, S. 73).Concerning modal particles, intensity particles or focus particles etc., the guidelines published withthe tagset do not assign them their own category.
It is implicitly clear from the cited examples thatmodal particles or intensity particles are to be tagged as adverbs "ADV".
(Schiller et al.
1999)On running the STTS with the treetagger on three transcripts of German spoken data (11029 to-kens), one finds that 35.76% of all corrected items were incorrectly tagged as adverbs and yet again85.87% of those items tagged as adverbs were actually particles or interjections (Westpfahl andSchmidt 2013).
Thus, the first step in restructuring the tagset would be finding categories differentiat-ing adverbs from particles as well as interjections and discourse markers.24 Features of spoken German - Speech particles in German grammar referencesIn order to explain the categorization employed in our proposed STTS 2.0 one has to take a deeperlook at how transcripts of spoken German differ from ?normal?
written language.
First of all, in ourcorpus, no punctuation is annotated and there also is no annotation on where a speaker's turn starts orends.
Secondly, it is typical of spoken language that not all utterances form ?proper?
sentences but arequite often disrupted, e.g.
marked by extensions or anacolutha, apokoinu-constructions, repairs etc.
Allthis would be represented as such in the transcripts.Furthermore, there are also differences in the choice of words, i.e.
some closed categories containother or more tokens in spoken language and some speech phenomena simply do not occur in writtenlanguage except for, maybe, in quoting direct speech.
Some of those phenomena are even hard to de-scribe as syntactic categories, e.g.
hesitation markers or backchannel signals.
Nevertheless, exactlythose phenomena are particularly interesting in working with a corpus of spoken language.The approach used for finding categories was to first take a look at the canon of German grammarsand then check whether the classifications made there could be applied for the corpus data.The most consulted grammars for the German language are (Duden 2006), (Zifonun 1997), (Engel2004), (Helbig 2011), (Hoffmann 2013), (Weinrich 2005) and the online grammar grammis 2.0 (Insti-tut f?r deutsche Sprache 2013).
The most consulted articles dealing with speech particles are(Burkhardt 1982), (Hentschel and Weydt 2002), (Schwitalla 2012) and (Diewald 2006).Looking at this literature it becomes obvious that research on this topic has, so far, not lead to a uni-fied classification of speech particles, but rather to a plethora of classifications and concepts differingat times quite radically in definition and nomenclature.
Even the terminology and definitions used forthe supercategory ?particles?
vary quite drastically.
For some, particles are all word classes which donot inflect, hence conjunctions and prepositions would be counted as particles as well (Engel 2004).Others differentiate between ?particles sensu lato?
(particles in the wider sense) and ?particles in thestrict sense?
or synsemantica (Hentschel and Weydt 2002; Duden 2006; Burkhardt 1982).
Yet againothers differentiate between those which distributionally contribute to the compositional structure ofthe sentence and those which can form sentence-independent units (Diewald 2006; Weinrich 2005;Hoffmann 2013; Zifonun 1997; Institut f?r deutsche Sprache 2013).
For those ?sentence-independent?units, e.g.
interjections and response particles, yet again a variety of terms is used: interactive units(?Interaktive Einheiten?)
(Hoffmann 2013; Zifonun 1997; Institut f?r deutsche Sprache 2013), dis-course particles (Diewald 2006), speaker signals and particles of the dialogue (?Sprechersignale undDialogpartikeln?)
(Weinrich 2005) or ?words of speech?
(?Gespr?chsw?rter?)
(Burkhardt 1982).As for statistical POS tagging the most important feature is distribution, the differentiation betweensentence-independent particles and sentence-internal particles seems to be a reasonable basis for clas-sification.
Hence we propose these two major categories for the tagset.
However, there are also parti-cles which are neither sentence-independent nor sentence-internal but are either in the pre-front fieldor in the end field of a sentence, namely discourse particles (?Diskurspartikeln?).
Quite surprisingly,these phenomena are hardly mentioned in any standard grammar reference at all.
The DUDEN (2006),Weinrich (2005), Burkhardt (1982) and Diewald (2006) subsume e.g.
reinsurance signals (?R?ckversi-cherungssignale?)
and starting signals (?Startsignale?)
under the term structuring particles(?Gliederungspartikeln?
), however, no distinction is made on whether they can stand independentlyfrom the sentence or not (Duden 2006).
The other grammars simply do not mention them at all.
Never-theless, a differentiation can be made between sentence-independent, sentence-internal and sentence-external particles.
By ?external?, I mean that they are not part of the core sentence yet ?need?
the sen-tence.
So how can these categories be subclassified now and which phenomena fall into these classes?4.1 Non-grammatical or sentence-independent elementsRegarding those particles which are sentence-independent, e.g.
??hm?
or ?hmm?, it is crucial tobear in mind that these phenomena cannot be classified according to their distribution or any syntacticfeatures.
Hence, the only criterion by which to differentiate them is with respect to their pragmaticfunction.
Taking a look at the grammar reference canon, one finds that DUDEN (2006) differentiatesbetween interjections and onomatopoeia and subclassifies the former ones into simple and complexinterjections, i.e.
between those which have homonyms in other word classes and those which do not.The GDS (Zifonun 1997), Hoffmann?s grammar (2013) and grammis 2.0 (Breindl and Donalies 2012)3differentiate between interjections and response particles (?Responsive?)
and Engel?s grammar (2004)adds initiating particles (?Initiativpartikeln?)
and reaction particles (?Reaktive Partikeln?)
to those.
Incontrast to that, Harald Weinrich?s grammar (2005) only defines interjections, but subclassifies thoseinto situational, expressive and imitative interjections.
Just looking at the terminology used for theirclassifications, one can get a hint of how contradictory the various definitions of interjections are.Whether response particles, onomatopoeia, inflectives or filled pauses are all interjections or separateclasses of their own always depends on how broad or strict a definition for the interjection would be.4.2 Sentence-external elementsSentence-external particles, namely discourse markers (?Diskursmarker?)
and tag questions(?R?ckversicherungspartikeln?
), are not classes which are explicitly named as such in any grammarreference yet are controversially debated in the research field of conversation analysis.
Only theDUDEN uses the term ?Diskursmarker?
but not in describing it as word class of its own, but only todifferentiate subjunctions from the use of the same lexeme (e.g.
weil or obwohl) with main clauses.Nevertheless, in the grammars we do find classes which could be subsumed under these concepts eventhough they are classified as, for example, structuring particles (?Gliederungspartikeln?)
(Hentscheland Weydt 2002; Burkhardt 1982), dialogue particles (?Dialogpartikeln?)
(Weinrich 2005) or ?Se-quenzpartikeln?
(sequencing particles) (Hentschel and Weydt 2002).
However, in all of these classesno differentiation is made between those which are really distributionally bound to the pre-front fieldor the end field and those which are sentence-independent.
In the literature on discourse markers thereis no agreement on what is to be subsumed under that term either.
Traugott (1997) and Auer andG?nthner (2005) define them as every utterance which has a peripheral syntactical position and a?metapragmatic function?.
What seems clear is that these phenomena came into existence throughgrammaticalization or degrammaticalization (Gohl and G?nthner 1999; Brinton 1996; G?nthner 2005;Leuschner 2005; Auer and G?nthner 2005), hence most of them are homophones of adverbs, conjunc-tions, subjunctions etc.
Imo (2012) yet again clearly differentiates between discourse markers and tagquestions as, according to him, they have a different function, namely only to demand attention or se-quencing turns whilst discourse markers would project the continuation of a speaker?s turn (Imo2012).4.3 Sentence-internal elementsAnalyzing those particle categories, the only ones which seem to be quite indisputable are verbal par-ticles and the ones which are defined by their form, i.e.
the particle ?zu?
used with the infinitive(PTKZU), ?am?
preceding an adjective (PTKA) and the negation particle ?nicht?
(PTKNEG), alt-hough the online grammar grammis 2.0 defines it to be a subclass of the focus particle (Breindl andDonalies 2011).Table 3 Comparison of criteria for modal particles and Abt?nungspartikeln in the literaturegrammarcriteriaDUDEN HSK GDS Diewald Schwitalla Grammis Hoffmann Weinrich Engel BurkhardtMP+AP MP AP MP AP MP AP MP AP MP+AP MP AP MP AP MP AP MP APexpress speak-er attitude  +  +  +  +n/a+n/a+  +  +  +n/a+n/a+changing theillocution  (+)  +  +  +  +  +  +changing theproposition  +  +  +  +  +answer foryes/no ques-tions+  +  +  -  +  -has consti-tuency value  -  -  -  - (-)  -may benegated  -  -  -  -can appear infront field  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  +  -alwaysunstressed  +  +  +  +  +AP Abt?nungspartikelnMP modal particles+ criterion is explicitly mentioned(+)  criterion is implicitly mentioned?

(I?m not able to find a translation; literally translated it would be something like?shading?
or ?coloration?
particles, A/N) from modal particles (?Modalpartikeln?
), such as Germanmal, halt, doch, or ja.
Furthermore, there are differences on whether to make a distinction betweenthese two terms, whether to treat them as synonyms (Duden 2006; Breindl and Donalies 2011a) orhaving only one class of items at all (Schwitalla 2012; Diewald 2006; Weinrich 2005; Burkhardt1982).Looking at the table one can find that the core definitions of those types of particles are very similar toeach other.
Criteria used to describe both types of particles in nearly all definitions are:?
the expression of attitudes, expectations, assumptions, and appraisal of the speaker and the ad-dressee?
the inability to appear in the front field?
they never form constituents of a sentence and thus cannot be moved at all?
apart from a few exceptions, they cannot be stressed.Also quite problematic is the differentiation of what is termed focus particles (?Fokuspartikeln?
), sca-lar particles (?Gradpartikeln?)
and intensifying particles (?Intensit?tspartikeln?)
such as Germannur,sogar, sehr etc.

see table 3It becomes obvious that the definitions of this group of particles are quite similar to each other exceptfor the focus particles not being omittable without changing the proposition of the sentence and inten-sifying particles not being able to precede noun phrases.
However, looking at spoken language, the lastdefinition can be easily contradicted ?
e.g.
considering the statement: ?Das ist aber sehr f?nfzehntesJahrhundert?
(This is very fifteenth century).
Looking at the data of our corpus, quite a lot of examplescome up where one could not easily decide whether the particles used would be only used for intensi-fying, bringing something into focus or for their scaling function, e.g.
: ?weil ich bin jetzt echt m?de?
(FOLK_E_00002_SE_01_T_01_DF_01, 00:30:46.94 - 00:30:53.93) (because I?m really tired now) or?voll die sau?
(FOLK_E_00021_SE_01_T_16_DF_01, 02:07:20.34 - 02:07:26.09) (truly/utterly apig).A third group of phenomena which are quite inconsistently classified are connective particles(?Konnektivpartikeln?
), maneuvering particles (?Rangierpartikeln?)
and conjunctive adverbs(?Konjunktionaladverbien?)
such as German allerdings, deshalb etc.
On grammis 2.0 for example it isstated that the term connective particles is simply a synonym of maneuvering particles and conjunctiveadverbs (Breindl and Donalies 2010).
These terms are also used in the DUDEN (2006) and in (Engel1 DUDEN claims that intensifying particles are synonyms to scalar particles.2 The GDS claims that focus particles are synonyms to scalar particles.3 The HSK claims that intensifying particles are synonyms to scalar particles.4 DUDEN vaguely claims that only ?some?
items of the class have a grading function.5 DUDEN vaguely claims that ?most?
of them can stand in the pre-front field.6 GDS claims that they cannot stand in the pre-front field except for the words ?noch?
and ?schon?.52004), however, they define them as something different than what is defined as connective particlesin Zifonun (1997), Hoffmann (2013), Breindl and Donalies (2010).
The problem here is based on thelinguistic level on which they are defined.
Some grammars define them according to their semanticsand classify them as to their conjunctive function albeit not being conjunctions.
Others define themaccording to their distribution in which case they rather have to be classified as adverbs rather thanparticles.5 The STTS 2.0 ?
new categories for speech particles5.1 Preliminary considerationsRestructuring the tagset is a task which requires some thoughts in advance.
First of all, as the tagset isstructured in a hierarchical way, new categories must fit into that hierarchical system.
Secondly, as theaim of the restructuring is not just a theoretical one but aims at practical use for the research communi-ty, it needs to be comprehensible.
However, the aim is not to follow a single grammar or theory butrather to build an unambiguous system of categories which are mutually exclusive and allow for anexhaustive categorization when applied to data of transcribed spoken language.
The general principlesfollowed were to construct the tagset as detailed as possible, to allow the research community to findas many phenomena typical for spoken language as possible, yet as coarse as necessary in order tomaintain consistency and to create mutually exclusive categories.
In contrast to, say, the VOICE cor-pus, in which several possible word class categories can be assigned to a token if it is ambiguous(VOICE 2013), in an automatized tagging relying only on statistical values, ambiguity ?
especiallywith respect to pragmatic information ?
cannot be taken into account as the tagging will not be manu-ally corrected.
Consistent with the original guidelines of the STTS each item shall receive only one tag(Schiller et al.
1999).
As a result, multiword expressions will not be tagged as one item either, evenwhen the pragmatic information in such cases might be lost.
However, the new structures built shouldbe coherent concerning the linguistic levels on which the annotation is based.
It has been discussedwhether e.g.
pragmatic and syntactic information should be specifically annotated on different annota-tion levels (see e.g.
Rehbein 2013).
One of the main reasons to annotate only one level of POS tags inour corpus is that, looking at spoken data, the syntactic function of an item is often deeply intertwinedwith its pragmatic function.
Nevertheless, this paper suggests a reclassification which on a theoreticallevel aims at a clear representation of the distinction between the linguistic levels which shall be as-signed through POS tags.In addition, as the transcripts are based on spoken language and follow the cGAT conventions, onehas to take into account that there are many utterances transcribed which cannot even be seen as'words', like sighing, laughing or breathing.
Hence, the categories created for typical spoken languagephenomena will still adhere to the concept of a ?word?
and only those items shall receive a POS tag.Being aware that the classical concept of the sentence cannot be applied to these transcripts of spo-ken data, the concept of the verbal bracket (Verbklammer) is still fundamental for the new categoriza-tion in order to describe the items in the utterances syntactically and also to determine whether theyapply to a syntactical concept at all.5.2 Extensions to the STTSAn overview on the structure of the categorization is given in table 5.
Firstly, items like e.g.
hesitationmarkers, interjections, onomatopoeia, inflectives or backchannel signals cannot be looked at on a syn-tactic linguistic level as they are not part of the syntax of a sentence.
They shall be tagged as non-grammatical elements and thus receive the supercategory tag NG.
As one category for all non-grammatical items would hardly be satisfactory to depict these various typical spoken language phe-nomena, one needs to consider a different linguistic level in order to further categorize them; namelytheir pragmatic function.To ensure that the subcategories are mutually exclusive, a closer look into the corpus data was nec-essary to check whether one (and only one) pragmatic function could be assigned to items that areconsidered non-grammatical.
Wherever this was not the case and one item could have several prag-matic functions, the items would have to be categorized into a 'broader' class of items.
Finally, itemslike onomatopoeia, inflectives and hesitation markers only have this one pragmatic function and thusget their own POS tag categories NGONO (Onomatopoetika), NGAKW (Aktionsw?rter) and NGHES6(Hesitationspartikeln).
However, response particles, backchannel signals and interjections do quiteoften take each other?s functions, e.g.
in the following example it is not clear whether ?ach?
is used asa response particle, a backchannel signal or an interjection.LB ?h isch ne GUte frage, ((schmatzt)) ?hh des hat einfach mit der diagNOse zu tun.
(that?s a good question ((smacking lips)) it?s just about the diagnosis)(0.22)LB gucke ma uns NAchher mal an dann.
(we?ll have a closer look at that later)ML ACH so;(ah)LB ja?
(yes) (FOLK_E_00008_SE_01_T_01_DF_01, 00:15:21.66 - 00:15:28.84)Hence, although on a theoretical level there might be differences between those classes, in analyzingspoken language these differentiations cannot be made in every case.
Thus, there will only be one POStag for those items in the STTS 2.0 which have the function of signaling response, backchanneling orinterjections ?
the NGIRR for ?Interjektionen, Rezeptionssignale und Responsive?.
Obviously, whatformerly has been tagged as answering particle PTKANT (Antwortpartikel) will subsequently betagged as NGIRR.
This restructuring needs to be done as the response particles "yes", "no", "maybe"etc.
are not ?
like the other particles which are tagged with the supercategory PTK ?
syntactically inte-grated in the sentence, i.e.
located in the middle field of a sentence.Secondly, there is the group of speech particles which are not part of the core sentence construction,yet pragmatically cannot stand on their own.
These 'sentence external' (SE) elements can be subclassi-fied into two classes.
Discourse markers stand in the pre-front field and need a sentence to follow, i.e.they open up a projection which needs to be filled by the following.
Tag questions stand in the endfield and are used to raise the hearer's attention.
Hence, two new POS tags are introduced to tag thoseitems: SEDM (discourse particles) and SEQU (tag questions).Table 5 schematic overview on the reclassification of speech particlessubject POS tagging distributional features proposed tags examplesItemsin thecorpusno tags assignedNo stable phoneti-cal form, annotatedaccording to cGATconventions (e.g.sighing, laughing,breathing etc.).

Those which are already represented in categories in the tagset andwhich are categorized based on their syntactic features will remain.
The PTKANT tag will be removedfrom this category.
Additionally, those sentence-internal particles which formerly have been tagged as7 There are hardly any Abt?nungspartikeln in the English language, thus no literal translations are possible.7adverbs, i.e.
modal, focus, scalar or intensifying particles shall be categorized as particles.
Althoughthe naming and the concepts for those particles are highly debated in the literature, syntactically, onecan clearly differentiate them from adverbs as adverbs can stand in the front field on their own whilstspeech particles cannot (Breindl and Donalies 2011).
Moreover, as Hirschmann (2013) pointed out,one can divide all these speech particle concepts into two groups: those which can be moved to thefront field together with their mother phrase and those which cannot be moved at all.
The latter onesare either modal particles or Abt?nungspartikeln, the former ones intensifying particles, focus particlesand scalar particles (Breindl and Donalies 2011b).
As evidently not even the grammars can give clearguidelines for the distinction of these classes, a categorization can only be based on distributional fea-tures.
Consequently, there shall be two new POS tag categories PTKIFG (Intensit?ts-, Fokus- undGradpartikeln) and PTKMA (Modal- und Abt?nungspartikeln).
However, annotating data one comesacross a set of sentence-internal particles which have not been accounted for so far.
Hirschmann(2013) presented an analysis of items which are part of multi-word lexemes.
They are bound to otherlexemes not by modifying them as an intensifyer, focus, or scalar particle, but they have to be consid-ered parts of multi-word constructions.
This can be proven by the fact that the elements in questionlose the meaning which they possess without the element they are joint with.
From an orthographicpoint of view, however, those particles, together with the other item, build a phrasal constituent.
Forexample, ?immer?
and ?noch?
in: ?Baba ist immer noch brummelig?
(Baba is still grumpy)(FOLK_E_00016, 13), together semantically form one lexeme which can also be seen in the transla-tion where both together are translated as ?still?.
Crucially, the word ?immer?
is neither an adverbwith the usual meaning ?always?
here, nor is it an intensifier with the meaning ?increasingly?
as in?immer besser?
(increasingly well/better).
In this one idiosyncratic case (?immer noch?
), ?immer?
canonlybe interpreted together with ?noch?
which can only be moved as a multi-word lexeme in the sen-tence.
The adverb ?noch?
can still be interpreted as the head of the whole expression.
In this respect,lexicalized particles are similar to the group of PTKIFG, with the difference that they neither have anintensifying, scaling or focusing function.
It seems like they are a very interesting group of particles,as one can analyze the gradual grammaticalization cline in such items.
Finding that it is a very restrict-ed group of possible items they shall receive their own tag PTKLEX for ?particle in a multi-word lex-eme?.6 Conclusion and outlookThis paper presented a proposal as to how new tag categories for an improved version of the STTS(STTS 2.0) in the field of speech particles could look like.To see whether these new categories work for part of speech annotation, guidelines have been writ-ten and the work on annotating a gold standard of about 100,000 tokens has begun.
In order to evalu-ate and validate the proposed tagset and the guidelines, Cohen?s kappa will be used to assess the inter-annotator agreement.
In addition, post-processing has been implemented that already helps to improvethe accuracy of the output, e.g.
by assigning POS-tags to those items which do not have any homo-nyms in other word classes, i.e.
through a list of items which shall receive this tag.
A first analysisshows that this proved to be extremely useful for the categories NGIRR, NGONO, NGHES, NGAKWand SEQU.However, in order to fully automatize part of speech tagging of transcripts of spoken language, a re-training of the tagger will be necessary.
Moreover ?
although the errors due to mis-tagged speech par-ticles were the most prominent cause for the low precision rate ?
additional sources of errors will haveto be analyzed to be able to create a coherent tagset for spoken language annotation.
The analysis ofthe colloquial use of pronouns, verbs, foreign language material or in the STTS so called ?non-words?might call for a further recategorization of the Stuttgart T?bingen tagset.8ReferencesAuer, Peter; G?nthner, Susanne (2005): Die Entstehung von Diskursmarkern im Deutschen - ein Fall vonGrammatikalisierung?
