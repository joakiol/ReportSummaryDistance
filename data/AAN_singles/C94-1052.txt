horacio@Isi.upc.esAbst ractThis paper describes the enhancements made, within aunification framework, based on typed featurestructures, in order to support linking of lexicalentries to their translation equivalents.
To help thistask we have developed an interactive nvironment:TGE.
Several experiments, corresponding to rather"closed" semantic domains, have been developed inorder to generate lexical cross-relations betweenEnglish and Spanish.KeywordsLexicons, electronic dictionaries, machine translation.1 IntroductionRecently, several approaches have been made to extendlexical unification-based formalisms to deal withmulti l inguistie phenomena in order to be used inapplications such ,as Machine Translation \[7\].Within Acquilex IP Project, a unification frameworkbased on typed feature structures \[4\] was ddveloped, theLKB (Lexical Knowledge Base), in order to representconceptual units corresponding to lexieal senses, lexicaland phrasal rules, multilingual rclalionships, elc.This paper describes the enhancements made, to the LKBsystem \[6\], in order to support linking of lexical entries totheir translation equivalents.
The organisation of the paperis as follows: Section 2 presents the motivations andformalisation of tlinks (for "translation links").
Section 3deals with TGE (Tlinks Generation Environment), theway we propose to help in constructing lexical linkagessemi-automatically from LKB data and bilingualdictionaries \[13\], \[8\], loaded in the LDR (Lexical DataBase) environment \[5\].

In section 5some experimental results ,are presented.
Finally in section6 we present our conclusions ,and furtl~er lines of research.2 T l inksThe initial assumption was that the basic units fordefining lexical translation equivalence should be thelexical entries in the monolingual LKBs, which should, ingeneral, correspond to word senses in the dictionary.Although in the simplest cases we c,'m consider the lexicalentries themselves as translation equiv,-dent, in generalmore complex cases occur corresponding to lexical gaps,differences in morphologic or lexical features, specificity,etc.
\[11\].We will therefore represent the relationships betweenwords in terms of tlinks.
The tlink mechanism is generalenough to allow the monolingual information to beaugmented with translation specific information, in avariety of ways.
We will first describe the tlinkmechanism in the LKB and then outline how some ofthese more complex equivalences can be represented.The LKB formalism uses a typed feature structure (FS)system for representing lexical knowledge.
So we candefine tlinks in terms of relations between FSs.
Lexical(or phrasal) transformatious in both source and targetlanguages ~ are a desirable capability so that we can statethat a tlink is essentially a relationship between two rules(of the sort already defined in the LKB) where the ruleinputs have been instantiated by the representations of theword senses to be linked.As shown in fig 1, fu rn i tu re  can be encoded astranslation equivalent to the plural muebles by specifyingthat the named rule plural  has to be applied to the basesense in Spanish.
As any other LKB object a tlink can berepresented as a feature structure, as shown in fig 2.
Thetype system mechanism, in the LKB, allows further4SEISD is an interactive nvironment built within Acquilexproject in order to help in constructing the LKB entries fromthe LDB sources.5 in fact tlinks are undirected relations.324identity<fs0:l> <fs0:0>furniture furnituretlink plural<fsl:0> <fsl:l>muebles muebleFigt~re 1: A tlink #etween furnit,tre anti muebles.f l~ tlink (top)< fsO > = rule<fsl>=rule< fs0:0 : sere : id > = < fsl : 0 : sem : id >.simple-flink (tlink) partial-tlink (simple-tlink)<fs0:0>=<fs0:l  > <fsl :0:rqs > = < fs0:O:rqs>.< fsl:0> =< fsl :1 >.,op \]I rule <0> = sign<1> = sign., , ,plmksal41ink (tlink)< fsI > = grammar-rule.Figttre 2."

A simple-t l ink is applicable whenever twolexical entries which denote single place predicates (nouns,etc.)
arEstraighfforwardly an equivalent translation, withoutany previous transformation.
Thus, assuming that theLDOCE \[9\] sense absinth L 0 1 is translatio,l equivalentto the VOX \[12\] sense absenta X I 1, we will have tilenext tlink:simple tlink<fs0:1 >==absinth L_0_I<fst : 1 >~absenta X I 1.The "syntactically sug~tred" version, which appears intlink files, is:absinth L 0 1 / absenta X t 1 :simple-tlink.A partial tlink is applicable when we want to transferthe quidia structure from one sense to anc)ther, and aphrasal tlink is necessary when we need to describe asingle word equivalent translation to a phrase \[I0\].3 TGE: Tlinks Generation EnvironmentThe establisment of tlinks can be obviously perlbrmedmanually, but the multiplicity of possible cases and theexistence of several Knowledge St)nrces (such as bilingualdictionaries, monolingt,al LDBs, or a mtddlingual \[.KB)allows and motivates the (parlizd) antomalizalion of theprocess.
To help in perl'orn~ing such a task wc havedeveloped an interactive environment: T(;I.\].TGE has been implemented using a Production Rulesapproach.
This approach was already used within theSEISD enviromnent ,'rod was mainly motivated by theneed of providing a flexible and open way of defining tlinkformation mechanisms.
The core of TGE is PRE(production rules Environment), a rnle-orieuted generalpurpose interpreter \[2\].
PPd~ follows the philosophy ofmost Production Rules Systems \[3\] but is deeplyadapted to Natural Language applications.
PRE offers apowerful (according to both expressiveness andperformance) rule applicatio,I mecljanism and provides thepossibilities of defining higher level mechanisms, uch asrulescts (allowing inheritance capabilities) ,and of choice,'unong control strategies, either usEr-definEd or provided bythe system.
Consider the following example:(rule rule-l-al lruleset alcontrol foreverpriority l(translation-in "trans-records (?translation *rest))->(modify 1 "trans-records (*rest))(create a'anslation^trans-psorts nil^trans-record ?translation^tlink-type nil ^ checked nil))In this rule the pattern-condition is the occurrence of anobject named translation-in ill the Working Memory.This object must ill tUrn contain a ^t rans - recordsattribute whose value will be matched against file pattern(?translation *rest).
If the matching succeeds then.
:/2.5translat ion will be unified with the first element of  tilelist and rest with the remainder elements.
The action partof the rule consists of two actions.
The t'ormer is themodification of t rans la t ion - in ,  popping its firstelement, and the latter performs the creation of anotherobject, named t rans lat ion.
Rule- l -a l l  rule is applieduntil all the objects n,-uned "translation-in" have emptiedthe list contained in their slot "trans-records.4 Us ing  TGE fo r  generat ing  T l inksThe TGE may be considered a toolbox attd thus, itdoesn't impose a fixed methodological strategy.
Whatevermethodology we follow, several decisions must be taken:the kind of control we need, the rulesets to be designed,"the rules belonging to each ruleset, the relative priorityassigned to each rule ,and so on.As regards the control strategy, one of tile following fouralternatives may be chosen lbr each source entry (see \[2\] of\[10\] for futher details):?
All, which executes all tile rulesets.
From tileproposed Oinks, finally the user chooses the correct ones.?
Collect, which executes the rulesets one at a timeand provides the results to the user (for selection of thecorrect ones) every time a ruleset succeeds.?
One-by-one, which orderly executes the rulesets,and stops as soon as one of them succeeds.?
Select, which only executes the rulcsets that the userchooses.An initial set of modules was designed according to tiletypology of tlinks presented so far.
It included four sortsof Oinks that showed distinct conceptual correspondencesbetween both languages.
A more in-depth study ofEnglish-Spanish mismatcfies \[11\] might lead to anenrichment of the typology, and co,lsequeully to a need Ibrextending the extant modules.Up tO now seven modules, each  one  i ln\ [} lumeulcd ,'is aruleset, have been developed.
Fach of them generates oneout of/he three kinds of tlinks stated above.
Each modulefollows a different strategy to guess a possible tlink,taking account of the lhree accessible knowledge sources.?
Simple Tl ink Module, this is tile case when thereexists a direct translation of the source entry in thebilinguN dictionary.
Ex,'unple:absenta x i 1 -->absenta LKB source entryabsenta --> absinth bilingual dictionaryabsinth --> absinth L_0 I l.KBtargctcntryabsenta x_i_I / absinth I.
0_1:SIMPt.E-qq-INK.
"absenta" is translated in the bilingual dictionary by"absinth", ABSINTH L_0 1 is a valid lexical entry of thetarget lexicon, and therefore a SIMPLE-TLINK connectingboth entries is created.?
Or thograph ic  T l ink Module, this case occurswhen in both languages the same word with exactly thesame spelling is used.
Therelbre, no bilingual dictionary isneeded.?
Compound Tl ink Module, this is the case whenthe corresponding entry in the target lexicon is acompound one, being the target lexio'd entry made up ofthe concatenation f the two English words that appear inthe bilingual entry.?
Phrasa l  Noun T l ink Module,  this case takesplace whenever the translation is the concatenation f twoother nouns; for example, the Spanish nouns for treesoften correspond.to wo nouns in English, (like limonero -lemon tree, melocotonero - peach tree, etc.).
Morecomplex cases can be recovered by using different grammarrules (also implemented within the LKB formalism).?
Parent  Tl ink Module, this is the case of thosevery specific terms in the source lexicon which are nottreated in the bilingual dictionary, but whose hypcronymsin the taxonomy have a clear translation that can generatea partial tlink.?
Grandparent  Tl ink Module, this is a very similarcase to the previous one, in which the source word'sgrandpm-ent is used to produce the partial tlink.?
General  Tl ink Module, this is the case when thetranslation appearing in the bil ingual dictionary iscomposed of more than one word.
Normally theseexplanations are made up as definitions in the form of agenus, plus some modifiers.
A tlink connecting the sourceentry and the genus appearing in the definition must becrcaied.We will illustrate the tlink generation process with anexample of an entry for which a number of different dinkshave been generated, namely batido X I 5.
In figure 3where bat ido_XI5 appears with the tlink options, wehad selected file option all and subsequently, all tilepossible tlinks have been suggested by the system.Ilowever the TGE allows for other selection criteria.
Aswe can see iu figure 3, five tlinks are suggested by tilesystem for this p~ticular example:I) The first option is not a correct one.
Among tilevarious translations given for the source LKB entrybatidoX_15 the adjective shot appears.
Because anothersyntactic realisation of shot is that of a noun denoting adrinkable thing therefore it is included ill the t,'uget subset.326r ~ File Edit Find Windows Packages fools Preferences Ldb Lk.b pro?

This is anexmnple of the application of the general-Ilink-rulesct.5 Resu l t sSeveral experiments correspondi ng to rather "closed" andnarrow semm~tic domains have been performed.
We discussnext thosc con'esl~mding It} "drinks" \[I0\].The Spanish taxouomy of (lrink-n(mns, cxu'acted fromVOX dictionary, consists of 235 noun senses atnd h:ls 5levels.
The English taxonomy of drit|k-nouns, exlractedfrom LDOCE, consists at' 192 notre senses.
Some of theobtained results are the following:?
While translating f,'om Slmnish to l~lI,jlish, 223 out of235 drink-nouns have been linked by means of differentaud often more than one tlinks (95 %).
However, only 52English nouns have been linked with Spanish nouns(27%).
Out of these 223 drink-nouns mentioned above,210 have been linked by using (mainly) the bilingu:ddictionary as a translation resource while the rest, 13 ofthem, have been linked by means of the orthographic-tlinkruleset and consequently, the gap of the bilingualdictionary has finally been bridged, for in both hntguagesthe stone word with exactly the same spelling is used.
Forexample, chartreuse X l 1 aud chartrettse_.L_l O,sherry X l l  mid sherry L 0_0, etc.?
74 out of 235 source I+KB entries for drink-nouns arealso bilingual entries (31,5%).
Consequently, 161 sourceI+KB entries have no corresponding bilingual entries(68,5%).
This big gap in the bilingual dictionary is due tothe \[act hat the one nsed, VOX/llarrap's, is a very basicone, and as such it only contains 32,463 senses, lucontrast he VOX monolingual Spanish dictionary coversa total of 143,700 senses.?
30 out of tilt translations of tilt 74 source I+KI\] entrieswhich were found in the bilingual dictionary are also tm'getI+KB entries.
Consequently, the translations of 44bilingual entries have uo corresponding target I+KBentries.?
13 out of 16l source LKB entries arc also target LKB327entries (8 %).?
For most entries, more than one tlink type has beenextracted.
The total number of tlinks which have beengenerated and selected for the t,~xonomy of bebida X I_3(drink) with the explained software is 372 tlinks.

We have reported ,and escribed resultsof an experiment for automatically extracting the relationsof equivalence for Spanish and English drink-nouns byusing the TGE software.
The resulting process is semi-automatic, whilst the tlink generation is performedautomatically, the selection of the desired tlinks is donemanually.All the tlink-rulesets l~ave worked satisf,qclorily,therefore resulting in a considerable part of the subsetsbeing linked (95% of the source lexicon), tlowever flmsePRE tlink-rulesets have only been tested over limitedsubsets of specific semantic fields.
Its actual potenti:d willbe proven in a later stage, once its application to largerand less restricted sets of word senses takes place,including also categories which ,are not considered to benouns.7,\[1\]Re ferencesAgeno A., Castell6n I., Martf M.A., Ribas F.,Rigau G., Rodrfguez t1., Taul~.
