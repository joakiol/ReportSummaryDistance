clauses and so one When it comes to finer details,though, the dlfferenoes between the two languages become morenot ieeab le  than the s imi la r i t ies :  the use of aux i l ia ry  verbsI;O represent tenses, for instance, is quite different (e.g~ didnot  ask = we c npocx~)The bas ic  task  o f  th i s  model i s  to  prov ide a means ofrepresent ing  in  the computer a~ Russ ian  graemat iee l  s t ruc turewh:Loh th.e analysis algorithm a&y have to express.
As far aspossible this representation must be independent of the particularconventions of either language.
For ezaaple we cnpocx~ wouldnot be ascribed an~ internal structure, but would be representedas "cHl~oc-/ask, negative, past tense".
The ana3~is woul8dlsoover these facts, conoe~t.z~ itself only with Russian conven-tions~ and the synthesis woula express thee in En s ~ p  o o n ~itse\]~ only with the English conventions.
"Negative" and u~tense" are examples of choices within closed sets of possibilities.Such sets  a re  known as systems.
Our model there fore  has two mainl insu is t i c  features ,  s t ruc ture  and system, which w~ both beneeded to describe a Russian sentence.
This tez~alnolo~ is takenf~oe the work of Halliday (1961).~he s t ructure  i s  fundamenta l~ a h ie rarchy  of const i tuents ,but  there  are  four  ways in  whieh i t  d i f fe rs  from a convent iona lconstituent structure:(1) Each constituent may e~eeplif~ choices in systems, and, asillustrated above, this means that some units in the tez~(e.g.
particles and auxiliaries) are not given places inthe s t ructure .
(2) One item may occupy more than one place in the structure.The on~ nee~ for this in scientiflo Russian seems to be-1 -the ~ role of a relative wet4 in linking a subordinateclause to some +higher eonatituent and at the same tlnesome role within its structure.
(3) There is no requirement fo~ a eonstituent to be eontinuousin.the text (although "~hose found by the eurrent analysisal&urltha always are) ,(~) I f  the systems are powerful enough there i s  no need forexp l io i t  ordering of suboonstituents.
This point wi l lbe taken up again la ter .The no,el: eoaputln~ featuresA grammatical structure of word-groups is represented inthe computer by a list structure, that is to say a collectionof stored items called elements with the property that eaehelement e i ther  ( i )  contains addresses of one or more otherelements, or (ii) is ma~ked as a terminal element?
Theelements represent single items (words or idAome); the otherelements each represent a larger word-group or eonctituent of thesentence= If an element A contains the address of an element B,this represents the fact that woz~l-group A inoludes word-group B.For example, the d~soriptlon of the structure of the groupwewSoAee ~pocTas AoKewwa~ CTp_~Typa includes four terLinalelements (for the four words) and two other elements, linked asfollows:=aw6oJee .

C noMoI~D is treated as one item since it is includedi n  the  ~ is t iomary  as am idiom)The En~ish e~nthesis algorithmThe synthes is  a lgor i thm has the task  of  tak ing  a sente~eexpressed in  terms of the model descr ibed above, an~ producingfrom it the string of characters which form the English outputsentenoe.The program uses the model statement to &uide it indecisions on:(1) re-ordering;(2) insertion of English 'function' words (auxiliaryverbs, etc.
);(3) selection of English equivalents from the shortlist in each dictionary entry;(4) inflection of English equivalents.These decisions are of course based on grammatical data only(both structural an~ systemic); in particular in the selectionof equivalents no semantic or eolloeational techniques are used.The particular tasks under these head in~ which areappropriate to a particular type of constituent will in generalneed to be car r ie~ out whatever the ro le  of the const i tuent  insome h igher  s t ruc ture  may be; a~ we are therefore  led  to theneed fo r  a separate rout ine  fo r  each const i tuent  ype.
Such arout ine  w i l l  be ca l led  a const i tuent  ype procedure (CTP).The nominal group CTP, fo r  example, w i l l  be ca l led  upon whenand only  when a nominal group has to be produced by the program.Since const i tuents  nest  w i th in  one another  f ree ly ,  one CTPw i l l  need to ca l l  on others  to deal  with the par ts  of theconstituent in turn.
The CTPs must in fact be written as fullyrecursive subroutines; and the program consists basically of aoontrol routine for exploring the list structure together witha set of CTPs, one for each constituent type.As was pointed out by Yngve (1960), it is a lin&uistic fact(a t  leas t  in  the Indo-European fami ly  of lansuages to whichRuss ian and Eng l i sh  Both belong) that  in  ma~ const i tuents  thef ina l  sub-const i tuent  i s a group of words, whi le other sub-const i tuents  are more f requent ly  s ing le  i tems.
Thus ,multiple"nest iu~ of the CTPs usua l ly  invo lves  f ina l  suboonst i tuents .But in  these cases a l l  deta i l s  of  the higher const i tuent  can be" forgotten"  by ~e computer s ince that  const i tuent  w i l l  not needto be re turned  to ;  so even a long sentence nsede no great depthof  push-down store  to han~e the nested CTPs.
(Lan~mge haspresumably evolved in  th i s  way because of  an analogous advantage-6 -i n  theThe first task of a CTP is to decide on any re-orderingneeded.
It implements such a decision simply by r e ~ gthe addresses in the element concerned.
Each CTP entered doesthls, so that the individual items are met in their new orderand can be added to the output string at once.The se lec t ion  and in f lec t ion  of equ iva lents  are  car r iedout a t  the time they  are  to be produced,  when a l l  re levantin fo rmat ion  i s  ava i lab le  to the CTP without  excurs ions  in too ther  par ts  of the s t ructure .
The inser t ion  of funct ion  words,on the o ther  hand,  say be done by a~y CTP.The resu l t ing  Eng l i sh  output s t r ing  i s  then passed to  af ina l  program which i s  respons ib le  fo r  format cont ro l .

They h~ve the advantage thattranslations can be produced when the algorithms are incomplete:provided the sub-trees proauced by a partial analysis are linkedarbitrarily to produce a single sentence structure, this canthen be explored by a synthesis algorithm, even one in whichseveral CTPs are replaced by dummies.
As new packages (analysispasses or synthesis CTPs) become available they can be incorpor-ated very simply.The work described above has been carried out at theNational Physical Laboratory.Referenae,s,I.
