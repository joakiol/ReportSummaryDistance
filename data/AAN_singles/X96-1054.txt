NameTag TM Japanese and Spanish Systems as Used for METChinatsu AoneSystems Research and Applications Corp. (SRA)4300 Fair Lakes CourtFairfax, VA 22033aonec@sra.com, h t tp : / /www.sra .com *1 Introduct ionWe have participated in the Multilingual Entity Task(MET) for Japanese and Spanish using SRA's mul-tilingual text-indexing software called NameTag TM.Its English version was used for the Named EntityTask (NE) in MUC-6 \[2\].
The NameTag Japaneseand Spanish systems were customized to accommo-date the MET-specific requirements and were able toachieve high performance in both recall and precision.2 MET System Descript ionFor MET, we used NameTag in its Japanese andSpanish configurations.
NameTag is an automatedtext indexing system that recognizes and classifiesnames and other key phrases uch as time and nu-meric expressions.
It is an enhanced offspring, im-plemented in C++, of the preprocessing module ofSRA's multilingual natural anguage processing sys-tem \[1\].
NameTag combines dynamic pattern recog-nition with static lexical ook-up to achieve high recalland precision at high speed.The NameTag engine is designed for multilingualcapabilities.
The same engine is used for different lan-guages using language-specific "plug-ins" such as to-kenizers, patterns, lexical data, alias generators, mor-phological analyzers, and segmenters.
Table 1 com-pares plug-ins used for different languages/tasks.NameTag has several unique features beside beingable to handle multiple languages.
First, it can gen-erate and link aliases of names automatically usinglanguage-specific alias generators.
For example, theSpanish system can recognize "Pefia" as an alias for"Josd Francisco Pefia Gdmez" by generating a pater-nal name alone.
The Japanese system currently per-forms a limited organization alias recognition such as*I'd llke to thank Mila Ramos-Santacruz and Misa Miyaclfi,who assisted me with manual tagging of development texts andlexical development for Spanish and Japanese respectively, andKevin Hausman, who is the principal developer ofthe C++NameTag engine.TokenizerPatternsLexical dataAlias generatorMorph analyzerSegmenterJp MET Sp MET Eg MUC-6YyYYoptionalnTable 1: NameTag configurations"DAIWA" as an alias for "DAIWABANK.
"Second, SRA's Japanese segmenter, which uses alarge lexicon, morphological nalysis, and heuristic-based rules to segment a sentence into words, is fullyintegrated into the NameTag engine.
Thus, the sys-tem can utilize the results of name recognition i  thesubsequent segmentation process and increase seg-mentation accuracy.Third, NameTag can take advantage of SGMLmarkers to improve performance.
For MET, head-lines (marked by <SLUG> or <HL>) were processedafter the main body of text (marked by <TXT>).This was advantageous forJapanese because any en-tity recognized in the main body was utilized in seg-mentation of headlines.
It also increased precision forSpanish because only lexicon and alias lookups wereapplied to all-upper-case h adlines, avoiding spuriousor erroneous names generated by patterns.Finally, NameTag provides a GUI-based multilin-gual development environment which facilitates rapiddevelopment ofpatterns.3 MET Results and AnalysisThe MET final blind tests were conducted using 100Kyodo articles for Japanese and 100 AFP articles forSpanish.
These articles were retrieved using the key-word "press conference."
Thus, they encompassedvarious ubject domains, including business, politics,sports, and arts, unlike the Wall Street Journal arti-463cles used for MUC-6.
In addition, the MET guide-lines had additional requirements not found in MUC-6, such as tagging of relative dates and tagging orga-nizations as locations when they are used as facilities.Despite the differences in types of articles and theadditional requirements, the NameTag Japanese andSpanish systems achieved high performance in bothrecall and precision.
The Japanese system is slower(15MB/h on a SPARC 20) than its Spanish and En-glish counterparts (93 MB/h and 80 MB/h respec-tively) because of the segmentation overhead.
Boththe Japanese and Spanish systems till have room forhigher recall because of shorter development time butalso partly because of difficult language-specific issuesto be solved, which we will discuss below.3.1 Japanese-specific IssuesThe MET evaluation has revealed several Japanese-specific challenges which must be solved in orderfor the system to achieve even higher performance.First, we have encountered what we call chicken-and-egg problems.
Good name recognition requiresgood segmentation, asname recognition patterns relyon properties of words segmented by the segmentersuch as part-of-speech and other linguistic attributes.However, good segmentation, in turn, relies on goodname recognition, as names are usually not in thelexicons and thus tend to cause segmentation errors.As discussed in Section 2, NameTag can utilize theresults of name recognition in subsequent segmenta-tion to partially solve this problem.
Additionally, itis essential that the segmenter be more robust andaccurate in order to improve performance on namerecognition and other Japanese text processing taskseven further.Another chicken-and-egg problem was encounteredin constructions where a person name and an orga-nization name appear next to each other in a sen-tence and there is no delimiter between the two(e.g.
"ABCDEFG" where ABC is a person name andDEFG an organization ame with no space or otherpunctuation in-between.)
Here, recognizing the per-son name requires recognizing the adjacent organi-zation name first while recognizing the organizationname requires recognizing the person name first.
Inthese cases, the system often mistags the whole stringas a person and misses the organization ame.The second big challenge is dealing with Japanesealiases, which are more complex than English aliases.The NameTag Japanese system currently generatesaliases like "SILICONGRAPHICS" for "SILICON-GRAPHICSCORP."
by stripping off certain corpo-rate designators at the end of names.
But it doesnot currently generate an alias which is a charac-ter subsequence of its full name like "NIKKOU" for"N__IHONKOUKUU."
Since aliases are, by definition,already recognized as names in a given article, theyoften appear in contexts where patterns do not ap-ply.
In these cases, not generating aliases results inmissing names (i.e., loss in recall).3.2 Spanish-specific IssuesIn addition to the general differences between METand the MUC-6 NE task described earlier, there werea few Spanish-specific ssues which had to be tackledfor MET.In the MET Spanish articles, the capitalizationconvention was rather unpredictable (e.g., "Ofic-ina de lucha contra la droga," "puerto cubano deMariel").
Thus, capitalization clue was not as rel-evant in Spanish MET texts as English WSJ texts inrecognizing proper names.
Consequently, the Span-ish system needed to perform deeper analysis of thetexts to achieve comparable results.The presence of "de" in Spanish person names hasmade person name recognition more difficult, as "de"is also a preposition, and sometimes caused a Spanishversion of chicken-and-egg problem.
For example, thesystem thought "Valle Rivas" in "Olijela del ValleRivas" was a location as "valle" also means "valley.
"On the other hand, it tagged "Roverto Marquevichde San Isidro" as a full person name though "de" isa preposition and "San Isidro" is a location name.4 SummaryThe MET evaluation has proved that NameTag canbe ported to other languages with a level of perfor-mance similar to English, despite various language-specific challenges.
We plan to port it to other un-segmented languages such as Chinese and Thai in ad-dition to other European languages.References\[1\]\[2\]Chinatsu Aone, Sharon Flank, Paul Krause,and Doug McKee.
