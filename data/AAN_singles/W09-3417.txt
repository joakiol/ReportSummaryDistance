TimeML is a specification lan-guage for events and temporal expressions intext.
This paper presents the problems and so-lutions for porting TimeML to Korean as apart of the Korean TARSQI Project.
We alsointroduce the KTTK which is an automaticmarkup tool of temporal and event-denotingexpressions in Korean text.1 IntroductionThe TARSQI (Temporal Awareness and Reason-ing systems for QA) Project 1  aims to developtechnology for annotation, extraction, and rea-soning of temporal information in natural lan-guage text.
The main result of the TARSQI Pro-ject consists of TimeML (Pustejovsky et.
al.,2003), TimeBank (Pustejovsky et.
al., 2006), andTARSQI Toolkit (TTK, Verhagen and Puste-jovsky, 2008).
TimeML is a specification lan-guage for events and temporal expressions in text.TimeBank is an annotated corpus which wasmade as a proof of the TimeML specification.TTK is an automatic system to extract events andtime expressions, creating temporal links be-tween them2.TimeML is an ISO standard of a temporalmarkup language and has been being extended toother languages such as Italian, Spanish, Chinese,1Refer to www.timeml.org for details on the TARSQI.2TTK contains GUTime (TIMEX3 tagging, Mani and Wil-son, 2000), Evita (event extraction, Saur?
et.
al., 2005),Slinket (modal parsing, Saur?
et.
al., 2006b), S2T, Blinker,Classifier, Sputlink, Link Merger, etc.etc.
(ISO/DIS 24617-1: 2008).
TempEval-2, atask for the Semeval-2010 competition, has beenproposed (Pustejovsky et.
al.
2008).
The task forthe TempEval-2 is evaluating events, time ex-pressions, and temporal relations.
Data sets willbe provided for English, Italian, Spanish, Chi-nese, and Korean.The necessity of temporal and event expres-sions markup for any robust performance such asQA (for Korean QA system, refer to Han et.
al.,2004), IE, or summarization is applied to KoreanNLP applications as well.
Recently, there havebeen TimeML-related studies for Korean: Jang et.al (2004) show an automatic annotation systemof temporal expressions with Timex2 in Koreantext.
Lee (2008) argues about the semantics ofKorean TimeML, specially the EVENT tag.
Imand Saur?
(2008) focus on the problems of Ti-meML application to Korean caused by typo-logical difference between English and Korean.Motivated by them, the Korean TARSQI Project3started with the purpose of making TimeML,TimeBank and TTK for Korean text4.Porting TimeML to other languages can bechallenging because of typological differencebetween languages.
In this paper, we present theproblems for TimeML application to Korean.Our solution is to change TimeML markup phi-losophy: a change from word-based in-line anno-tation to morpheme-based stand-off annotation.Based on the changed annotation philosophy, wedecide how to annotate temporal and event-denoting expressions in Korean text.
More spe-cifically, it is challenging to decide whether weuse LINK tags or attributes to annotate some3See http://word.snu.ac.kr/k-tarsqi/doku.php for more in-formation about the KTARSQI Project.4James Pustejovsky gave a talk about TARSQI for KTAR-SQI Project, visiting Korea for his invited talk at CIL 18conference in 2008.115temporal or event-denoting expressions (see ex-amples in 3.2).
In section 4, we describe thespecification of Korean TimeML (KTimeML).Section 5 introduces Korean TTK (KTTK).
Be-fore discussing the issues of Korean TimeML,we briefly introduce TimeML.2 The Basics of TimeMLTimeML features four major data structures:EVENT, TIMEX3, SIGNAL, and LINK.
TheEVENT tag encodes event-denoting expressions.The TIMEX3 tag annotates temporal expressionsof different sorts: fully specified dates, times,and durations, or just partially specified dates,times, and durations.
The SIGNAL tag annotateselements that indicate how temporal objects arerelated among them (e.g., subordinating connec-tors such as when or after).The LINK tag splits into three main types: (a)TLINK, which encodes temporal relations amongEVENTs and TIMEX3s; (b) ALINK, representingaspectual information as expressed between anaspectual predicate and its embedded event; and(c) SLINK, encoding subordination relationsconveying evidentiality (e.g.
Mary said [shebought some wine]), factivity (John regretted[Mary bought wine]), or intensionality (Katethought [Mary bought beer]).Information relevant to each tag is character-ized by means of attribute-value pairs (refer toPustejovsky et.
al.
2003 about specific attributes-value pairs).

relatedToEvent=?e3?relType=?INITIATES?/>Sentence (1) presents three EVENT expressions(said, began, and work).
SLINK conveys an evi-dential relation between e1 (said) and e2 (began).TLINK represents a temporal relation ?
AFTER-between the two same events.
ALINK encodes anaspectual relation ?initiates?
between e2 (be-gan) and e3 (work).
Due to space limitations,some EVENT attributes are obviated.3 Porting TimeML to Korean3.1 The Characteristics of KoreanKorean is an agglutinative language whosewords are formed by joining morphemes to-gether, where an affix typically represents oneunit of meaning and bound morphemes are ex-pressed by affixes.
For example, the sentenceJohn-i emeni-kkeyse o-si-ess-ta-te-ra ?John-Nommother-Nom come-Hon-Past-Quo-Ret-Dec 5 ?means that (I heard) (John said) that his mothercame.
Each morpheme has its own functionalmeaning or content.As shown above, consideration of morphemesis important for TimeML markup of Korean text.Here, we summarize TimeML-related character-istics of Korean:(i) In Korean, functional markers (tense, aspect,mood, modality, etc.)
are represented morphologically.English as an isolating language uses periphrasticconjugation to represent functional categories.(e.g.
?-keyss-?is a conjectural modal morpheme in pi-ka o-keyss-ta ?it will rain?.
While, ?will?
is an auxil-iary verb in it will rain.
)(ii) Some subordination is realized morphologicallyvia morpheme contraction.(e.g.
?-ta-n-ta?
is a morphological contraction whichdenotes quotation in the sentence John-i nayil o-n-ta-n-ta ?John-Nom tomorrow come-Pres-Dec.Quo-Pres-Dec?.
Its English counterpart is represented by subor-dination: John said that he will come tomorrow)(iii) Some connectives in English correspond to mor-phemes in Korean.(e.g.
Korean counterpart of the English connective?and?
in I ate milk and went to sleep is the morpheme?-ko?
in the sentence na-nun wuyu-rul masi-ko ca-reka-ss-ta ?I-Top milk-Acc drink-and sleep-ending go-Past-Dec?
)(iv) The sentence type of English is represented byword order but that of Korean by ending morphemes(e.g.
Declarative: pi-ka o-n-ta ?it is raining?
interroga-tive: pi-ka o-ni?
?Is it raining??
)5Nom: nominative case, Hon: honorific morpheme,Past: past tense morpheme, Quo: quotative moodmorpheme, Ret: retrospective mood morpheme, Dec:declarative sentence ending116These properties of Korean make the porting ofTimeML to Korean challenging.
In the next sec-tion, we discuss the basic issues of KTimeML.3.2 Basic Issues of Korean TimeML3.2.1 Morpheme-based standoff annotationTimeML employs word-based in-line annotation.It poses a challenge at the representation level,since it encodes information mainly based on thestructure of the target language, and thus contentequivalences among different languages are hardto establish.
For example, indirect quotation inKorean offers an example of the mismatch oflinguistic devices employed in different lan-guages to express the same meaning.
Quotationconstructions in English use two predicates, thereporting and the reported, which TimeMLmarks up as independent EVENTs:(2) John saide1 he boughte2 a pen.<SLINK eventID=?e1?
subordinatedE-vent=?e2?relType=?EVIDENTIAL?/>TimeML uses a subordination link (SLINK) inorder to convey the evidentiality feature that thereporting predicate projects to the event ex-pressed by its subordinated argument.On the other hand, a Korean quotative con-struction, as in (3), has only one verb stem,which corresponds to the subordinated predicatein English.
Note that there is no reporting predi-cate such as say in English.
Nevertheless, thesentence has a reporting interpretation.
(3) John-i  ku-ka  wine-ul  sa-ss-ta-n-taJ-Nom    he-Nom  wine-Acc  buy-Past-Quo-Pres-Dec?John said that he bought some wine?The quotative expression ?ta-n-ta above is a con-tracted form of ?ta-ko malha-n-ta ?Dec-Quo say-Pres-Dec?.
Although (3) is a simple sentence in-volving no subordination at the syntactic level,the two tense markers, ?-ss-?
and ?-n-?, are evi-dence of the existence of an implicit reportingevent.
Specifically, the past tense marker ?-ss-?applies to the main event here (sa-ss ?buy-past?
),while the present tense marker ?-n-?
is under-stood as applying to the implicit reporting event(ta-n-ta ?report-pres-Dec)6.Constructions presented above show a prob-lem for the standard TimeML treatment of a Ko-rean quotative sentence.
The relationship be-tween reporting and reported events is expressedmorphologically, and thus the SLINK mechanism6Tense markers of the construction can change: sa-ss-tay-ss-ta ?buy-past-quo-past-dec: said_bought?
; sa-n-ta-n-ta?buy-pres-quo-pres-dec: say_buy?, etc.for word-based annotation is not adaptable here.Because Korean transfers meanings throughmorphological constructions, morpheme-basedannotation is more effective than word-based forTimeML application to Korean7.For morpheme-based tagging, we proposestand-off annotation for Korean because it needstwo-level annotation: the MORPH tag 8  and Ti-meML tags.
Standoff annotation separates mor-phologically-annotated data from primary dataand saves it in a different file, and then TimeMLannotation applies to the data.
The following isthe proposed morpheme-based stand-off annota-tion for (3).

Standoff annotation makes it pos-sible to extract information about two eventswithout using a non-text consuming EVENT tag.Moreover, each of the two tense morphemes isproperly assigned to its related event.
Our pro-posed TimeML annotation scheme is composedof two levels ?
morphological analysis and Ti-meML annotation.7There can be several ways of annotating morphologicalconstructions: morpheme-based, morpho-syntactic unit-based (refer to MAF: Cl?ment and Clergerie, 2005), charac-ter-based, and bunsetsu-based.
At present, we adopt mor-pheme-based annotation because it seems to be enough tointroduce the required units for KTimeML markup and wewant to avoid the possible redundancy of bunsetsu-based ormorpho-syntactic unit-based annotation.
Moreover, thecriterion for separation of a morphological construction isrelated with tags such as EVENT, TIMEX3, or attributes liketense, aspect, mood, or modality in KTimeML, not withsyntactic or phonological information.
Standoff annotationmakes it easy to mark up the interval of morphemes.
Never-theless, we consider the possible advantage of morpho-syntactic analysis positively for future work.8The values of the POS attribute are based on a KoreanPart_of_Speech Tag Set version 1.0 (Kim and Seo, 1994).1173.2.2 Surface-based annotationKTimeML adopts the surface-based annotationphilosophy of TimeML (Saur?
et.
al.
2006a),which does not encode the actual interpretationof the constructions it marks up, but their gram-matical features.
For example, the leaving eventin the sentence we are leaving tomorrow is notannotated as expressing a future tense, but asexpressed by means of a present tense form.Several considerations motivate this surface-based approach.
As an annotation language, itmust guarantee the marking up of corpora in anefficient and consistent way, ensuring high inter-annotator agreement.
As a representationscheme, it needs to be used for training andevaluating algorithms for both temporal informa-tion extraction and temporal reasoning.A surface-based approach is the suitable op-tion for meeting such requirements.
Neverthe-less, it poses a challenge at the representationlevel.
How to represent evidentiality in Koreanand English shows the challenge.
(5) I sawe1 that John boughte2 some wine.<SLINK lid=?sl1?
eventID=?e1?
subordinat-edEvent=?e2?
relType=?EVIDENTIAL?/>English, as an isolating language, expresses evi-dentiality in a periphrastic manner.
Hence, theTimeML treatment of these constructions con-sists in marking the two involved predicates asEVENTs, and introducing an SLINK betweenthem.
Korean has both periphrastic and morpho-logical ways for expressing evidentiality.
Anno-tating the periphrastic version with the standardTimeML treatment poses no problem because ithas two predicates denoting events like its Eng-lish counterpart.
Morphological constructionshowever, are harder to handle, because the retro-spective mood morpheme ?-te-?
brings about theimplicit reference to a seeing event.
(6) Vietnam-un   tep-te-raVietnam-Top  hot-Ret-Dec?
(as I saw) Vietnam was hot?They are similar to quotative constructions in thesense that, although there is only one predicateexpressed on the surface, the sentence refers tomore than one event.
Unlike quotative construc-tions, there is no morphological evidence of theimplicit event; e.g.
tense or sentence moodmarkers independent of those applied to the onlyverbal predicate in the sentence.
The issue toconsider is therefore whether to treat the eviden-tial constructions by introducing an EVENT tagfor the retrospective mood marker as in (7) or tohandle them by specifying the evidential value ofthe main predicate at the MOOD attribute of itsEVENT tag, as illustrated in (8).

pos=?ADJECTIVE?tense=?NONE?
mood=?RETROSPECTIVE?/>As in (7), adding an EVENT tag for the retrospec-tive morpheme corresponds semantically to Eng-lish-based TimeML.
However, it is not surface-based, because the perception event is an implicitevent entailed by the retrospective morpheme.While, the annotation in (8) is a surface-basedannotation of the evidential construction whichuses the MOOD attribute for retrospective mood,thus respects the surface-based philosophy ofTimeML.
This is different from the Englishcounterpart that presents two EVENTs relatedwith a TLINK signaling their relative temporalorder.
KTimeML follows the surface-based an-notation philosophy of TimeML ((8) here).3.2.3 Cancellation of the head-only ruleTimeML employs the head-only markup policyin order to avoid problems derived from taggingdiscontinuous sequence (e.g.
we are not fullyprepared).
If the event is expressed by a verbalphrase, the EVENT tag will be applied only to itshead, which is marked in bold face in the exam-ples (e.g.
has been scrambling, to buy, did notdisclose).
However, Korean does not have thediscontinuity problem.
See Korean examples:(9) a.
*na-nun cwunpitoy-e   wanpyekhakey  iss-taI-Top  prepared-e    fully      exist-Dec?we are fully prepared?b.
*John-un  ca-ko         anh-iss-taJ-Top    sleep-ko      Neg-exist-Dec?John is not sleeping?In the above sentences, ?-e iss-?
and ?-ko iss-?
arerespectively perfective and progressive aspectmarkers.
No word can make discontinuous se-quence by being embedded into the middle of theverb phrases.
As we saw from the examples, Ko-rean does not have discontinuity problem in ver-bal phrases.
Thus, KTimeML does not need tofollow the head-only annotation rule.
By cancel-lation of the head-only rule, we annotate various118verbal clusters (main verb + auxiliary verb con-struction: e.g.
mek-ko iss-ta ?eat-progressive-dec?).
It makes the KTimeML more readable byshowing the progressive aspect-denoting expres-sion -ko iss- in one unit of annotation.4  Specification of the Korean TimeMLBased on the proposed annotation principles ofKTimeML, we present the specification of thefirst version of KTimeML (KTimeML 1.1) withchanged tags, attributes, and their values.
Weassume that the MORPH-tagged data are sepa-rately saved in a different file.
KTimeML con-tains EVENT, TIMEX3, SIGNAL, and LINK tags.Some new attributes such as mood and sTypeare added to the attributes of the EVENT tag.
Theother tags have no changes from the TimeMLtags9.KTimeML 1.1 adds the attributes of predi-cate_content (pred), mood, verb_form (vForm),and sentence type (sType) to the attributes ofEVENT in TimeML (For Korean grammar, referto Sohn, 1999, Nam and Ko, 2005).
The BNF ofEVENT is shown below:attributes ::= id pred morph yaleRomanizationclass pos tense [aspect][mood][sType][modality] vFormid ::= ID{id ::= EventIDEventID ::= e<integer>}morph ::= IDREF{morph ::= MorphID}yaleRomanization ::= CDATApred ::= CDATAclass ::= ?OCCURRENCE?|?ASPECTUAL?|?STATE?|?PERCEPTION?|?REPORTING?|?I_STATE?|?I_ACTION?pos ::= ?ADJECTIVE?|?NOUN?|?VERB?|?OTHER?tense ::= ?PAST?|?NONE?aspect ::= ?PROGRESSIVE?|?PERFECTIVE?|?DURATIVE?

{default, if absent, is 'S_FINAL'}polarity ::= ?NEG?|?POS?
{default, if absent, is 'POS'}KTimeML puts the semantic content of EVENT-tagged expressions for international communica-tion.
Because mood is not an important gram-matical category for English, TimeML does not9Nevertheless, how to annotate various morphologi-cal constructions in the specific texts is not trivial.The annotation guideline, which will be published onthe web, will handle the issues in detail.markup a mood attribute, but KTimeML adds themood attribute since there are morphemes thatexpress mood like many other languages.
UnlikeEnglish, different sentence ending morphemesrepresent sentence types in Korean.
Hence,KTimeML adds sType to attributes of theEVENT tag.
We put vForm to distinguish be-tween different subordinated clauses10.Event classes in KTimeML are the same asTimeML.
Korean tense system does not havedistinction between present and future unlikeEnglish, and thus the tense attribute has PASTand NONE values.
We add DURATIVE to aspectattribute values in KTimeML for the durativeexpression such as combination of stative verb +progressive aspect marker (e.g.
al-ko iss-ta?know-durative-Dec?
).For mood, KTimeML 1.1 puts the retrospectivemood (?-te-?).
The values of vForm attribute areS_FINAL, CONNECTIVE, and NOMINALIZED,and ADNOMINAL.
The sentence types in Koreanare DECLARATIVE, INTEROGGATIVE, IM-PERATIVE, and PROPOSITIVE (e.g.
cip-ey ka-ca?Let?s go home?).
KTimeML puts CONJEC-TURAL (e.g.
nayil pi-ka o-keyss-ta ?
(I guess) Itwill rain tomorrow?)
as a modality value and de-fault is NONE.
The sentence in (10) is an inter-esting example that includes all attributes of anEVENT tag for Korean TimeML except for as-pect.

For example, pwuthe ?from?and kkaci ?to?
in 3ilpwuthe 5ilkkaci ?From 3rd to5th?
both are the counterparts of prepositions inEnglish (Jang et.
al., 2004).
We do not tag tem-poral morphemes as SIGNALs, in principle.
In-stead, we mark up 3ilpwuthe ?from 3rd?
with oneTIMEX3 tag.
However, temporal connectivessuch as ttay ?when?
in ku-ka o-ass-ul ttay young-hee-nun ttena-ss-ta ?When he came, Youngheeleft?
are tagged as SIGNALs.SIGNAL is used to annotate sections of text -typically function words - that indicate how tem-poral objects are to be related to each other.
Itincludes temporal connectives (e.g.
ttay ?when?,tongan ?during?
), and temporal noun (e.g.
hwu?after?, cen ?before?).

The finishing event is related temporallywith the leaving event by the signal ???(?after?
).Naturally, the relation type of the TLINK is AF-TER.
From ALINK, additional TLINKs are de-rived between visiting, finishing, and leavingevents.5  Korean TARSQI ToolKitBased on the specification of KTimeML, westarted to develop KTTK11.Figure 1.
Korean TARSQI ArchitectureAt first, the normalization of the raw document isdone in the preprocessor module.
Here the rawtext is separated into sentences, wide charactersare substituted by regular characters, punctuationsymbols are normalized (specially quotationmarks), sino-korean characters (hanja) aretranscribed in hangul, and, the encoding is alsonormalized to unicode.The next module is called Pykts (PythonWrapper for KTS).
Here, sentences are parsed inorder to get their morphological components,which is achieved by means of a program calledKTS.
With the exception of this morphologicalparser, which was programmed in C, all the othercomponents of our project are being written inPython in order to achieve good results in lesstime.
The output of Pykts is a Document objectcomposed by a hyerarchical data structure ofdocument, sentences, words and morphemes,which is passed to the Event Tagger.The Event Tagger consists of three modules: apreprocessor where the chunking of TimeExpressions is done; a module called Saken,which does the tagging of events; and, a modulecalled Sigan for TIMEX3 tagging.
Then, LINK11The architecture mainly relies on that of TTK.However, KTTK introduces a morphological analyzerfor morpheme-based standoff annotation.
KTTK usesthe Aspectual Verb Lexicon for ALINK extraction.121taggers add TLINK, ALINK, SLINK tags.
Amodule S2T changes the annotated SLINKs andALINKs into TLINKs.
In the final step, the LINKMerger merges all TLINKs with temporal closure.6 Conclusion and Future WorkTemporal and event information extraction is animportant step for QA and other inference ortemporal reasoning systems.
Korean TARSQIProject aims at (1) making KTimeML; (2) build-ing Korean TimeBank as a gold standard, and (3)developing KTTK as an automatic markup tool oftemporal and event expressions in Korean text.In this paper, we presented problems in port-ing TimeML to Korean and proposed changes ofTimeML philosophy.
Since consideration ofmorphological issues is a basic step for KTi-meML, we introduce a morpheme-based two-level stand-off annotation scheme.
We adopt thesurface-based annotation of TimeML, but do notfollow the head-only annotation.The tags of KTimeML are EVENT, TIMEX3,TLINK, ALINK, and SLINKs.
The morphologicalannotation is saved as separate data.
The EVENTtag has the attributes such as vForm, sType,mood, and modality in addition to the attrib-utes of TimeML.
We showed the architecture ofKTTK.This work will be a help for QA, IE, and otherrobust performance for Korean.
In addition,KTimeML will be, hopefully, a model for port-ing TimeML to other agglutinative languagessuch as Japanese.AknowledgementsThe authors wish to thank Kiyong Lee (ISO-TimeML) and James Pustejovsky, a director ofthe TARSQI Project, for their help for the speci-fication of KTimeML.ReferencesLionel Cl?ment and ?ric Villemonte de la Clergerie.
