?bisDepartment ofEstonianUniversity of Tartu50409 Tartu, Estoniaandriela@ut.eeAbstractThe paper gives an overview of repair se-quences used in Estonian spoken informationdialogues.
62 calls for information, travel bu-reaus, shops or outpatients?
departments areanalysed.
Several repair types are considered.Our further aim is to develop a dialogue sys-tem which can interact with the user in Esto-nian following the norms and rules of human-human communication1 IntroductionOur goal is to build a dialogue system that would beable to interact with humans in Estonian using normsand rules of human-human communication.
Human-human communication is not fluent, problems thatmust be solved arise continuously.
Similar problemsoccur in human-computer interaction.Several branches of linguistics study how to solvecommunication problems: discourse analysis, psy-cholinguistics, foreign language learning, conversa-tion analysis, dialogue modelling on the computerand determining dialogue acts (Allen, Core, 1997;Linell, 1998; Bunt, 1999; Traum, 1999; Allwood etal.
2001; O'Brien, 2002).
Similar phenomena arecalled differently: structure shifts, feedback, ground-ing, repair, communication strategies.
There are atleast the following difficulties with these treatments:1) repair is considered together with other dia-logue management acts and not as a separate phe-nomenon as it is in natural conversation2) different means of repair are considered insteadof repair as a process and sequence3) non-natural utterances are used in dialogue sys-tems for repairs (To Paris, is that correct?
/ I don'tquite understand )To overcome these problems, we analyse repairusing the methods of the conversation analysis (Sche-gloff et al1977).
There are 4 kinds of repairs differ-enced in CA: self-initiated self-repair, other-initiatedself-repair, self-initiated other-repair, other-initiatedother-repair.
All the repairs analyzed in this paper areother-initiated self-repairs.
We differentiate threesubtypes here: clarification (45 cases), non-understanding (7), and reformulation (27).We have analyzed calls for information (askingphone numbers, addresses etc.
), and calls to travelbureaus, shops and outpatients' departments.
Theanalysed sub-corpus consists of 62 dialogues; 2472dialogue act tags were used in our sub-corpus, amongthem 79 repair initiations (about dialogue acts seeHennoste et al2003).2 Other-Initiated Self-RepairIn the case of clarification and non-understanding thehearer initiates the repair and the partner solves theproblem.
Non-understanding means that hearer didn?thear or didn?t understand something in speaker?sprevious utterance.
There are two main possibilitiesto initiate repair: general question which only indi-cates that there was a problem (e.g.
mida/what, kui-das/pardon), or wh-questions to localise the problemexactly.
The problem is solved by repeating, elaborat-ing or explicating the problematic information.In our dialogues, the non-understanding is initi-ated mostly to indicate non-hearing (6 examples from7) by using general questions kuidas/ pardon or ut-terance ei kuule/I don't hear.
The problem is solvedby repeating the problematic information, either ex-actly or with modifications.11In examples, the participants are C (client) and O (infor-mation officer).

Repeating of the problematic part of utterance+ tag-question particle (e.g.
jah/yes) are used to initi-ate the repair.
The problem is solved by agreeingwith it or rejecting it.Clarification is initiated in two ways in our data:- a phrase or declarative sentence that repeats theproblematic part (70%)- the same + a question-particle jah/yes, v?/or,?hes?naga / in short (23%).The problems are solved mostly by using- jah, jaa /yes, mhmh (60%)- the same + repeating or adjusting the previous turn(12%).O: nii on pakkuda (0.5) k?mme kaks-k?mend.(.

|PPE: CLARI-FICATION|ten twenty>O: jah.
|PPJ: REPAIR|yesIn reformulation the hearer initiates the repair andsuggests her own interpretation of the problematicissue.
The partner agrees with it or rejects this inter-pretation.
The most frequent ways for repair initiationare:- word, phrase, sentence (22% of cases)- the same + a questioning particle siis/then, jah/ yes,eks/eh, v?/or (30%)- et/that, t?hendab/it means that + word, phrase, sen-tence (33%).The problem is solved by- jah, jaa / yes, mhmh / yes (41%)- jah, jaa / yes + repeat or explanation (33%)- explanation (22%).O: ja m pr?egu no ?tleme keskminehind on oleneb n?

|PPJ: REPAIR|yes3 The Structure of Repair Sequence3.1 Prototypical Repair SequencesIn the prototype case, the client asks and the officeranswers in information dialogues (the roles can bereversed in some cases, e.g.
when the officer asksclient's personal data).
There are two prototypicallocations of repair sequence: after client?s ques-tion/request and officer?s answer.
They give us twoprototypical repair sequences.A.
Problem in question/requestMAIN LINE: question/request of the clientREPAIR SEQUENCE:> Repair initiation by officer> Problem solving by clientBACK TO MAIN LINE: officer's answerB.
Problem in answerMAIN LINE: officer's answerREPAIR SEQUENCE:> Repair initiation by client> Problem solving by officerBACK TO MAIN LINE: client?s response (mhmh/ahah / jah) + (new) question / request / finishing con-versation69% of repairs that concern question/request belongto prototype A.
This forms 14% from all repairs.
44%of repairs regarding answer belong to prototype B.This makes up 27% of all the repairs (75% of themare clarifications).
In sum, 71% of non-under-standings, 40% clarifications and 33% reformulationsare prototypical.3.2 Untypical Repair SequencesFirst, there exist peripheral variants of prototypicalrepair structures.
The remaining examples in group Ado not constitute clear sub-groups.
In group B thereare some more clearly deviating repair sub-groups.1.
A participant initiates repair regarding informationin some earlier turn.Repairs are initiated regarding the immediatelyprevious turn in 90% of cases, but there are someexamples, where client clarifies information which(s)he got earlier in the conversation and breaks theprocess of giving information by consultant, as in thefollowing example.
After repair C gives response bycontinuer mhmh.
Only after this O continues to giveinformation.O: kolmk?mmend viis ruutmeetritdushsh on seal olemas, (.)
m?
?turidon seal olemas (1.0) [korras]it has got thirty five square me-ters, a shower, it has got watermeters [in order]>C: [ja tuhat kolmsada.]
|PPE: CLA-RIFICATION|[and one thousand three hundred]>O: jah.
(.)
|PPJ: REPAIR|yesC: mhmhmhmhO: elektri boiler on seal olemas,(0.5) ja ta on t?hi.it has got a boiler (0.5) and it'semptyThe structure is as follows:O giving information>C repair initiation regarding earlier information>O problem solvingC continuer mhmhO continues giving information2.
The answerer/consultant returns to the main line,not the client, as it is in prototypical B type repair.For example, the client initiates a repair regardingthe beginning of an e-mail address and breaks theofficer's dictation of the address.
In this case, the of-ficer (O) must return to the main line, not the client(C).
There are two possibilities to do this:- O carries out a repair and continues giving informa-tion in the same turn- O carries out a repair, C gives back the turn usingparticle mhmh and O continues to give information.Therefore, there are two structures:O giving information>C initiation of repair>O problem solving + continuation of giving infor-mationO giving information>C initiation of repair>O problem solvingC mhmhO continuation of giving information3.
Some turns are added after the repair before return-ing to the main line (8 cases).The problem is that officer believes that his/heranswer given before repair initiation was finished,but client does not.
So the client does not return tothe main line after problem solving but sends the turnback by using jah/yes or mhmh/yes.
Then the officersends turn back again and only after that the clientreturns to the main line.
The structure is as follows:O: answer (giving information)>C: initiation of repair>O: problem solvingC: jah / mhmhO: jah / mhmh / adjusting or repeatC: (mhmh +) new question / finishing conversation /adjusting or justifying the requestSecond, there are some repair sequences with re-versed roles - the officer asks questions and the clientanswers.4.
Simple structures with reversed rolesSuch repairs occur first of all at the end of conversa-tion where the client and the officer negotiate thenext meeting and the officer asks client's address orphone number.
Two types occurred.First, conversation continues with reversed rolesafter repair, the officer asks a new question:C giving information>O initiation of repair>C problem solvingO repeat + new questionO: ?
(.)
kes te olete.what's your nameC: ja nimi on Saabas.

|PPJ: REPAIR|yesO: Saabas.

where do you live (0.8) itis in Tartu yes?Second, officer wants to return to normal roles andgives the turn back to client using the particle mhmhor repeating earlier information:C giving information>O initiation of repair>C problem solvingO mhmh /repeatC new question / finishing conversationO: ja nimi onand the name isC: Saabas, Arvo.
Saabas Arvo(6.5) ((O writes down the name))>O: Arvo jah?

|PPJ: REPAIR|yesO: teeme siis nimodi et k?mme kaks-k?mend.
(0.5)|let's do so that (let?s meet) atten twentyC: ait?h?thank you5.
The second group are sequences where officercannot answer the client?s question immediately butneeds some additional information (6 examples).
Sohe/she uses one or two adjusting questions at first andthen initiates repair.
Client solves the problem.
Andthen the answer to the client?s question follows.
Thestructure is as follows:C question / request(O adjusting conditions of answer)(C giving information)O adjusting conditions of answerC giving information>O initiation of repair>C problem solving(O adjusting conditions of answer)(C giving information)O answers to the C's question/request4 ConclusionWe are not able to direct the behaviour of humanswho communicate with the computer.
Nevertheless,we can design our dialogue system in such a way asto minimize the reasons of repairs by the user.
Theprimary strategy of the computer would be to provideclear and exhaustive information so that the need toclarify or re-formulate would be unnecessary.
Thecomputer itself must initiate repairs to clarify whatinformation the user wants.
The repair mechanism ofthe computer that simulates information officer canbe prototypical (type A) because this occurs mostlyin human-human communication.Our further work will concentrate on the analysisof a bigger corpus in order to find out and explainmore repair structures which could be modelled in adialogue system.AcknowledgementThis work was supported in part by EstonianScience Foundation under Grant No.
