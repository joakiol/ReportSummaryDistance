HassaneinArabic Department, American Univers i ty  in CairoABSTRACT sequence of three le t ters ,  called a tr i l i teral  root.A proposed  "Matrix" method for  the representat ionof the inflectional paradigms of Arabic words isp resented .
This representat ion  resu l ts  in aclassif ication of Arabic words into a tree s t ruc ture(F ig ( l ) )  whose leaves represent  un iqueconjugational or derivat ional  parad igms,  eachrepresented  in the proposed  "Matrix" form.A study of about 2,500 stems from a high frequencyArabic wordList due to Landau <I> has revealed asystematic set of co-occurrence patterns for theencLitic pronouns of Arabic verbs and for thepossessive pronouns attached to Arabic nouns.
Eachco-occurrence pattern represents asubcategorization frame that reflects the underlyingsemantic relationship.The key feature that d is t ingu ishes  these semanticpat terns  has been observed  to be whether  theattached suf f ixes  relate to the animate or inanimate.In some cases for verbs ,  the number  of the subjectis also a s igni f icant  feature .
These semanticfeatures  also extend to non-at tached sub jects  andobjects ( for  verbs )  and to possess ive  nouncomplements ( for  nouns) .
Therefore  the semanticc lasses presented  in this paper  also ass i s t  insyntactic/semantic analysis.The first application that Was developed, basedupon the proposed representaion is a stem-basedArabic morphological ans/yser, from which a spellchecker (on a PS/2 microcomputer) emerged as aby-product.
Currently, the system is being used tointeract with an Arabic syntactic parser and thereare plans to use it in a machine assisted translationsystem.i .
INTRODUCTIONOver the past  few years  there has been a markedincrease in the use of computers  in the Arabicspeak ing  countr ies .
Many appl icat ions programs inArabic have been developed,  but  the field ofcomputat ions/  l inguist ics is relat ively new in Arabicand presents  a un ique chal lenge, due to the h ighlyinf lected nature  of the Arabic language.In the present  work,  we have attempted torepresent  the morphological ru les  govern ing  theinf lections of Arabic words in a compact form whichcan simplify the process ing  of Arabic words bycomputers  and which is independent  of the apart icu lar  appl icat ion.
There have been otherattempts to show the conjugat ions of Arabic verbs<2> but  the t reatment  does not delve into suf f ic ientdepth  and not all encl it ics,  which are an essent ia lpar t  of Arabic verbs ,  are cons idered.
Moreover,the t reatment  in <2> does not extend to nouns .By s tudy ing  some 2,500 stems out of a h ighf requency  Arabic wordl ist  due to Landau <1>,certa in systemat ic  o -occur rence  pat terns  govern ingverb  enclit ics and noun possess ive  pronouns  havebeen observed .
These pat terns  are what we call"Matrices" in this paper ;  each un ique "Matrix"ref lects a d i f ferent  semantic behav iour .To summarize Arabic morphology in a nutshe l l ,about  80 ~, of Arabic words can be der ived from aFor example, i f  we cons ider  the root ~ ,~(K T B),  we can form words such  as .l  -, .r _..?~(?aKTuB - I wr ite)  and , ~  (KiTa:B - book) ,  bysub ject ing the root to var ious "forms" or "moulds"and by  undergo ing  certa in morpho-phonemic (andposs ib ly  also morpho-graphemic)  hanges .
For a fulld iscuss ion of tradit ional  Arabic morphology see <9>and <10>.
In this paper ,  we shall define such aninflected form to be a "STEM".Thus a stem may contain infixes and certainprefixes which are part of the "mould" but may notcontain any suffixes.
Suffixes for verbs are subjectand object pronouns, while for nouns they arepossessive pronouns.One further definition which is used in theproposed representaion is the "Core"; this is simplythe inflected form with all prefixes and suffixesstripped off.
The core may or may not be a validword.In comparison with other  work in the area oftradit ional Arabic morphology (<3>,<4>), where theconcern is with the rules which cause the inf lectedform to be der ived from the ROOT, we have studiedthe rules governing the derivation of all possibleinflected forms from the STEM, as defined above.2.
THE MATRIX  REPRESENTATIONSample "MATRIX PARADIGMS" are shown inFig(2) for verbs and Fig(3) for nouns.
Table(1)gives the keys in English to the columns on theMatrix Paradigms.
The inflected form for a givenPerson/Number~Gender/Mode combination for verbs(obtained from the relevant "row" of the MatrixParadigm) is constructed by concatenating theprefix, core and both subject and object pronouncolumn entries.
The inflected forms for nouns aresinfilarly const ructed  for a part icu larNumber /Gender /Case  combination.The various "cells" of the object pronoun columnsindicate whether a particular entry is valid(indicated by "U', an Arabic numeral one).
Invalidentries are indicated by a "'", an Arabic zero.
Itis due to this matrix of ones and zeros that therepresentation was named the "Matrix Paradigm".3.
TAXONOMY OF ARABIC WORDSF ig ( l )  shows a tree diagram represent ing  thetaxonomical classif ication of Arabic verbs  andnouns .
There  are d i f ferent  "levels" in the treecor respond to d i f ferent  types of var iat ions of theinf lected form from one class to another .
The f i rsttype of var iat ion coincides more or less with thetradit ional classif ication and is respresented  atlevels 2 and 3 for verbs  and at level 2 for  nouns .Each Matrix Paradigm also reflects two furthertypes of variation, which can be consideredseparately from one another.
The first is thevariation in the core with the different rows; thisdimension cor responds ,  for example, to thetradit ional s tudy  of verb  conjugat ions (see <2>).- I -416The other type of variation is that in thedistribution of the Matrix of ones and zeros, whichis essentially a variation in the co-occurrence ofobject pronouns (for transitive verbs) andpossessive pronouns (for nouns).
This variation isreflected at level 4 of the taxonomy.
In thefollowing sections 3.1 and 3.2, we will discuss thestudy of these co-occurrence patterns in more detailfor verbs  and nouns  separate ly .3.1 CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS FOR VERBSOn examination of the Landau <I> high frequencywordlist, the following features eemed todistinguish classes of verbs apart:1- Whether the subject  is human or non-human (forboth t rans i t ive  and int rans i t ive  verbs ) .2- Whether the object is human or non-human (fort rans i t ive  verbs  only) .3- The number  of the subject  ( for  in t rans i t ive"verbs only) .in Arabic,  there is a set of object p ronouns  whichre fers  to a non-human object: (t .
,~,~,a) and thiswill be denoted by -H. This is a subset  of thecomplete set of p ronouns  +H, which denotes humanand non-human.
Below, we will d iscuss  the featuresfor t rans i t ive and h i t rans i t ive  verbs  separate ly :(a) Trans i t ive  Verbs :As shown in the table below, there can only be 4combinations of the features  +H and -H. Each of thefeature sets  in the table has been des ignated aclass cede.
Only verbs  with features  cor respond ingto the feature sets  B,C and D have been found inthe Landau <I> short l i s t  examined.Feature Set code  ~B +H +HC +H -HD *H -H?
-H -H(b) Intz-ansitive Verbs :It was found out that the subject  number  is anadditional d i s t ingu ish ing  feature for t rans i t iveverbs .
Moreover, the subject  number  is sigmificantonly in the case of human subjects.
For non-humansubjects, this feature is not significant.Based upon the above observat ions ,  we will definethe d i s t ingu ish ing  features  for in t rans i t ive  verbs  tobe +H(s ) ,+H(dp)  and -H, where s denotes s ingu larand dp denotes dua l /p lura l .
+H(s) and +H(dp)denote the sets  of s ingu lar  and dua l /p lura lsub jects ,  respect ive ly .
By definit ion+t{(s) U +H(dp) -H, where U denotes the unionof the two feature sets .
The table below shows thepossible combinations of these features ;  onlyfeatures  des ignated by  A,E and F were found forLandau's  <1> short t i s t .Feature Set Code S_uu:bjegt Feature___&A +H(s) U +H(dp)E -HF +H(dp)?
+H(s)3.2 CO-OCCURRENCE PATTERNS FOR NOUNSThe same set of object p ronouns  for verbs  denotesthe possess ive  pronouns  for nouns ,  with theexception of a sl ight di f ference in form of the f i rstperson  s ingular .
The -H set  is exact ly the same.Three dist inct c lasses of Matrix pat terns  (seelevel 3 of F ig ( l ) )  have been observed  for nouns:~ 2 -(A) No possess ive  pronouns  can be attached.
(B) All possess ive  pronouns  can be attached.
(C) Only possess ive  pronouns  related to theinanimate (set  -H) can be at tached.An addit ional s tudy  was made to determine whatNumber /Gender  (NG) combinations are valid for  apart icu lar  noun stem.
These have been found to bean important  feature  of Arabic nouns ,  as not all NGcombinations are valid for a stem?
Each stem needsto be examined separate ly  and this information isput  into the lexicon of stem.
The NG combinationsare represented  at level 3 of the taxonomy, fornouns (see F ig ( l ) ) .A l though there is no systemat ic ,  theoretical methodfor deternf ining what all the di f ferent NGcombinations are for comprehensive coverage ofnouns, yet by examining more and more nouns fromLandau's <I> wordlist, some form of convergenceoccurred.
For the 2,500 stem shortlist, there wereonly 17 NG combinations.This curious feature of Arabic nouns can be mainlyattributed to the presence of words of foreignorigin and to the pragmatics of the noun inquestion.4.
APPLICATIONS DEVELOPEDAs a first appl icat ion, an Arabic s tem-basedmorphological ana lyser  has been developed on anIBM PS/2 microcomputer.
Morphological features  ofthe word analysed are computed.As a by -product  of the ana lyser ,  an Arabic spel l ingverifier has been developed, by includingunification of the morphological nd co-occurrencefeatures of the morphemes.The system is cur rent ly  being developed for.
use inthe interact ion with an Arabic syntact ic  parser .ACKNOWLEDGEMENTThe authors incerely wish to thank Dr. John Sowafor reviewing tl~is paper and for his invaluablecomments and suggestions.REFERENCES<1> Jacob Landau, "A Word Count of Modern ArabicProse", American Council of Learned Societies,New York, 1959.<2> Peter F.
