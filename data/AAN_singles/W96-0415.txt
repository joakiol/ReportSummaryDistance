A generative perspective on verbs and their readingsManf red  Stede"Tedmische Utfiversitiit BerlinUiuversity of TorontoAbst ractWe sketch the architecture of a sentence gen-eration module that maps a language-neutral"deep" representation to a language-specificsentence-semantic specification, which isgiven to a front-end generator.
Lexicaliza-t, ion is tlm main instrument tbr the mapl~ingstep, and we examine the role of verb seman-tics in the process.
In particular, we proposea set of rules that derive a range of verb alter-nations from a single base form, which is onesource of lexical paraphrasing in the system.1 Overv iewThis paper examines the role of several as-pects of verb semantics for natural language gen-eral,ion.
We assume a scenario of producing sen-tences in multiple languages from a common under-lying representation~although the problems of mul-tilinguality will not be an explicit topic here.
Section2 briefly describes the architecture of an implementedgenerator, called MOOSE, and characterizes the twolevels of representation i volved:, a language-neutrallevel for representing various kinds of events, and alanguage-specific level of semantic sentence specifica-tion, which largely corresponds to the level of'sentenceplans' used in systems based on a linguistic uppermodel, specifically PENMAN \[Bateman et el.
1990\].The lexicon of a target language is the primary vehi-cle for mapping from one level to the other.
Then,sections 3 and4 discuss our primary topic: verb se-mantics.
First, a treatment of several Aktionsart fea-tures is proposed, and the role of valency in the tippermodel idea is examined, and improvements suggested.Section 4 proposes a set of rules for systematicallycomputing alternations (or diatheses) of a verb froma single base form.4*For their helpful comments and suggestions for improv-ing this paper, I thank two anonymous reviewers.

de1412 Two-s tep  sentence  generat ionThe MOOSE sentence generator grew out of expe-riences with building the TECHDOC system \[RSsner,Stede 1994\], which produces instructional text in mul-tiple l:mguages from a common representation.
Specif-ically, MOOSE accounts for the fact that events canreceive different verbalizations even in closely relatedlanguages such as English and German.
It is designedas a sentence generation module that pays attention tolanguage-specific lexical idiosyncrasies, and that canbe incorporated into a larger-scale text generator.2.1 MOOSE in a nutshe l lFor this brief description of the system architec-ture, see figure 1.
The generator assumes a language-neutral level of event representation, the situationspecification or SitSpec.
Using parts of t, he target lexi-con (see section 2.3), the lexical options for verbalizingthe SitSpec are determined.
For verbs, the applicablealternations and extensions are computed (see section4) and added to the set of options.
Then a language-specific semantic specification SemSpec is constructedin accordance with generation parameters pertainingto brevity and stylistic tbatures.
The SemSpec is thenhanded over to a surface generator: Penman \[Pen-man Group 1989\] for English, and a variant developedat FAW Uhn for German.
As opposed to the 'tradi-tional' Penman idea, the domain model in which theinput SitSpec is represented has been de-coupled fromthe linguistic upper model, in order to achieve varietyin verbalization that would otherwise not be possible\[Stede and Grote 1995\], MOOSE is implemented inMacintosh Common Lisp and uses MacPenman; a fulldescription of the system is given in \[Stede 1996\].2.2 Leve ls  o f  representat ionA central assumption of the research reported hereis that the "deepest" level of representation is in gen-eral not a linguistic representation; i stead, we assumea domain model of some sort, implemented in a KI=I.language.
Thus, an explicit transition between instan-tinted domain knowledge and a language-specific se-mantic sentence representation is seen as the centralstep in generation.E/G~ 0  Dow~in O ~  0 M del0 ~ 0  Generation .

Accordingly, wesee the upper model as a taxonomy of lexical classes.SemSpecs are constructed from SitSpecs by select-ing a UM-process and mapping SitSpec ,:dements toparticipant roles of that process, so that all elementsof the SitSpec are covered.
This choice of processand participants in effect establishes a perspective onthe situation; SitSpec is underspecified in this respect.SemSpec is still underspecified with regard to, for ex-ample, constituent order and lexical choice betweennear-synonyms (that have the same semantics withrespect to SitSpec yet differ in terms of style, collo-cational restrictions, etc.).
These and other decisionsare made, on the basis of verbalization parameters, bythe surface generators.2.3 The  ro le  o f  the  lex iconMOOSE is designed with the goal of strong lexicalparaphrasing capabilities in mind.
Therefore, its lex-icon is rich in information so that lexical choices canbe made on the basis of various generation parame-ters (which are not discussed in this paper).
A lexicalentry in MOOSE has the following components:Denotat ion  A partial SitSpec that defines the ?,p-plicability condition of the lexeme: if its denotationsubsumes ome part of the input SitSpec, then (andonly then) it is a candidate lexical option for the ver-balization.Cover ing  The subset of the denotation odes thatare actually expressed by the lexeme.

I ,~f the SitSpec--SemSpec mapping is theproduction of a ~o,-,e .... , ,'-' .. -: ~... 7, ~"the partial SemSpecs (PSemSpecs) associated with asubset of the lexical options, such that the lexemes inthis subset collectively cover the entire SitSpec.
Thisunification process is driven by the candidate verbs;their PSemSpec consists of an upper model processand the mappings from situation elements to processparticipants, which is achieved by co-indexing withpositions in the denotation.
By means of sharing this143information between denotation and PSemSpec, thelexicon entries serve as a "bridge" between the SitSpecto be verbalized and the intermediate representationSemSpec; thus, the role of the lexicon in MOOSE issomewhat similar to that in DIOGENES \[Nirenburgand Nirenburg 1988\].Importantly, the denotation of a lexeme need not bea single concept; instead, it, can be a complete configu-ration of concepts and roles (cf.
Horacek \[1990\]).
Thisis necessary since we want to break up the internalevent structure in the representation of verb mean-ing.
Consequences are higher computational cost infinding lexical options, but also a higher flexibility infinding different, verbalizations of the same event.
Asan example, consider the denotation of the causativereading of to fill:(event (PRE-STATE (fill-state (VALUE (not 'full))(CONTAINER A) ) )(ACTIVITY (CAUSER B))(POST-STATE (fill-state (VALUE < D ~full >)(CONTAIIIER A)(C0~TENT C) ) ) )The variables are bound to instances or atomic valuesof the SitSpec when the two are matched against eachother.
The filler of the VALUE role in the POST-STATEappears in angle brackets because it is a default value,which we do not discuss further here, though.
Theaccompanying partial SemSpec of to fill contains thesame variables:(x / d i rec ted-act ion  : lox  fill:actor B :actee h :inclusive C <:destination D>)When the denotation is matched against a SitSpec,the variable bindings are propagated to the partialSemSpec; and when it is unified with the partial Sem-Specs corresponding to the other elements, a completeSemSpec results, from which PENMAN produces asentence like .Jill filled the tank with oil.
(If the VALUEis different from 'full, it also gets verbalized, such asin Jill filled the tank to the second mark.
)3 Verb  semant ics3.1 Akt ionsar tqince wrh denotations are complex enough to re-flect certain parts of event structure, they can be re-lated to the notion of Aktionsart: the verb-inherentfeatures characterizing (primarily) the temporal distri-bution of the event denoted.
The variety of phenom-ena in Aktionsart are far from clear-cut, and there isno generally accepted and well-defined set of features.In the following, we use the terms given by Bussmann\[1983\] and discuss only those Aktionsart features thatare directly relevant for us because they relate typesof  SITUATIONS to denotations of verbs.
Thus, withinthe context of our system, we define Aktionsart fea-tures in terms of patterns of verb denotations.
Thefollowing table lists the correspondences.Akt ionsar t  \[ Denotat ion  pat terns ta t ive  ( s ta te  X)durative (protracted-act ivity X)semelfactive (moment aneous-act ivity X)transformative (event (PRE-STATE X)(POST-STATE not-X) )resultative (event (ACTIVITY X)(POST-STATE Y)causative (activity (CAUSER X) )Simple cases are stative verbs like to own or toknow.
Durative verbs characterize continuous occur-fences that do not, have internal structure, like tosleep, to sit.
In the class of non-durative verbs wefind, amongst others, the opposition between itera-tire and semelfactive ones.
The former are durativeactivities that result from repeating the same occur-rence.
In contrast, a semelfactive verb denotes a singleoccurrence, thus in our system a MOMENTANEOUS-ACTIVITY, as for example to knock.
Transformativeverbs involve a change of some state, without a clearlyrecognizable vent that would be responsible for it:The room lit up.
The denotation of such verbs thus in-volves a pre-state and a post-state, which is the nega-tion of the former.
In our ontology, these are TRANSI-TIONS.
Resultative verbs, on the other hand, charac-terize situations in which something is going on andthen comes to an end, thereby resulting in some news ta te  (CULMINATIONS in our ontology).
Their denota-tion includes an activity and a post-state.
In the liter-ature, such verbs are often also called inchoative.
1 Thefinal verb-inherent feature we use is the well-knowncausative, which reflects the presence of a CAUSER inthe denotation.3.2 Va lencyValency, as introduced by Tesnigre \[1959\], refers tothe distinction between actants and circumstantials(central participants associated with the verb versustemporal, locational, and other circumstances).
Thisseparation is in principle widely accepted, but viewsdiffer on where to draw the line and how to motivateit.
The notion of valency was further developed pre-dominantly in German linguistics, with a culminationpoint being the valency dictionary of German verbs1 The term ' inchoative'  is used to cover a radmr broad rangeof phenomena,  including the beginning of an event (e.g., to in-/'/ame) or its coming to an end.
We think the term is overloadedand prefer to use ' resultat ive'  for the latter group.by Helbig and Schenkel \[1973\].
They made an addi-tional distinction between 'obligatory' and 'optional'actants; Somers \[1987, ch.
1\] proceeded to propose sixdifferent levels of valency binding.
He also pointed outthat there are different opinions on the type of entitiesthat are subject to a verb's valency requirements: dif-ferent authors describe them by syntactic lass, someby semantic deep cases, and some by their fimction(subject, object, etc.
).In our approach, which is driven by the (practi-cal) needs of MLG, we aim at encapsulating syntac-tic matters in the front-end generators and here lookat valency in the SitSpec-SemSpec mapping: Whencharacterizing the linking between SitSpec elementsand SemSpec participants/circumstances, w  describevalency in terms of upper model concepts.We wish to distinguish cases like the following:?
Tom disconnected the wire {from the plug}.
Todisconnect requires a SOURCE,  but it can be omit-ted in a suitable specific context.?
Sally ate.
While to eat usually requires a directobject,, it can also be used intransitively due tothe strong semantic expectation it creates on thenature of the object- - independent of the context.?
Tom put the book on the table.
To put requires aDESTINATION, and it cannot be omitted, no mat-ter how specific the context.?
The water drained from the tank" {in the garage}.Locative circumstances like in the garage are notrestricted to particular verbs and can occur inaddition to PATHS required by the verb.Adopting the three categories proposed by Helbigand Schenkel \[1973\], we distinguish between obligatoryand optional participants on the one hand, and cir-cumstances on the other.
The criterion of optionality,as indicated above, singles out the obligatory comple-ments.
But how, exactly, can we motivate the distinc-tion between optional participants and circumstancesin our framework?
By relating the PSemSpec to theSitSpec, via the denotation.
In the disconnect case, forinstance, the two items CONNECTOR and CONNECTEEare both integral elements of the situation.
The sit-uation would not be well-formed with either of themabsent, and the domain model encodes this restric-tion.
Therefore, both elements also occur in the de-notation of to disconnect, and a co-indexed variableprovides the link to the PSemSpec.
Only when build-ing the sentence SemSpec is it relevant o know thatthe CONNECTEE can be omitted.
The CONNECTEE inthe denotation therefore must have its counterpart inthe PSemSpec--that is the SOURCE, but there it ismarked as optional (see figure 6 below).144With circumstances, the situation is different: ASitSpec is complete and well-formed without the in-formation on, for instance, the location of an event.Hence, a verb's denotation cannot contain that infor-mation, and it follows that it is not present in thePSemSpec, either.3.3 Verbs  and  the  upper  mode lNow, since our instrument for ensuring the well-formedness of PSemSpecs and SemSpecs is the uppermodel, we need to inspect the role of valency infor-mation in the UM.
On the one hand, Bateman et el.\[1990\] are well aware of the problems with ascribingsimple valency patterns to verbs, but for the prac-tical implementation of Penman and the UM, somestrict--and simplifying--category distinctions had tobe made.
Thus, all participants of process types, aslisted above, are coded in LOOM as obligatory roles.Circumstances, on the other hand, are in the UMcoded as LOOM relations, and there are no restric-tions as to what circumstances can occur with whatprocesses.
Spatio-temporal information is generallyseen as a circumstance.
Concerning the linguistic re-alizations, Penman and the UM in their present formessentially go back to the Tesnb~rian suggestion thatparticipants are realized as nominal groups (with someobvious exceptions, as in say that x), and circum-stances as prepositional phrases or as adverbs.But neither this syntactic division corresponding toparticipants and circumstances (direct or indirect ob-ject versns adverbs or prepositional phrases) nor theUM's semantic postulate that spatio-temporal aspectsare circumstances hold in general.
Regarding spa-tial relationships, we find verbs that specifically re-quire PATH-expressions, which cannot be treated ona par with circumstances: Recall to put, which re-quires a direct object and a DESTINATION.
Causativeto pour requires a direct object as well as a PATH witheither a SOURCE, or a DEST INAT ION,  or both: pourthe water from the can into the bucket.
Some verbs,as is well-known, can occur with either a PATH (Tomwalked into the garden) or with a PLACE (Tom walkedin the garden), and only in tile garden can here betreated as a circumstance.
And to disconnect requiresa direct object ,(the entity that is disconnected) anda SOURCE (the entity that something is disconnectedfrom), which can be omitted if it is obvious from thecontext: Disconnect ile wire!The upper model in its present, form cannot, makedistinctions of this kind.
It is not, possible to specifya PATH expression, which will be realized as a prepo-sitional phrase, as an obligatory participant.
Aboutto disconnect (in the causative reading), which is aMATERIAL-PROCESS, tile UM can only state that the145roles ACTOR and ACTEE must be filled, but not the factthat there is another entity involved--in the domainmodel called the CONNZCTEZ--which is verbalized asa SOURCE.
Moreover, the UM does not know that theCONNECTEE is optional in the verbalization; it doesnot distinguish between obligatory and optional par-ticipants.As a step forward to a more fine-grained distinctionbetween participants and circumstances, we differenti-ate between requirements of process types (as coded inthe UM)  and requirements of individual verbs, whichare to be coded in the lexical entries.
In a nutshell,valency (as a lexical property) needs to supplementthe participant/circumstance requirements that canbe stated for types of processes.
To encode the va-lency information, we use the partial SemSpec of alexicon entry.
The participant roles stated there areeither obligatory or optional, in which case they aremarked with angle brackets:to d isconnectPSS: (x / d i rected-act ion:actor A :actee B < :source C >)With obligatory participants, the verb is only applica-ble if the elements denoted by these participants arepresent in the SitSpec.
Optional participants need notnecessarily be included in the verbalization: If they arepresent in the SitSpec, they may be omitted if there issome good reason (e.g., a stylistic preference); if theyare not present in the SitSpec, the verb can be usedanyway.4 A l te rnat ions  and  extens ionsHaving explained denotations and PSemSpecs,specifically for verbs, we can now deal with the taskof accounting for the different alternations a verb canundergo.
A generator needs to know that a verb liketo fill can occur in a variety of configurations: Waterfilled the tank, The tank filled with water, Tom filledthe tank with water.
The most, comprehensive sourceof information on verb alternations i the compilationby Levin \[1993\]; we inspect some of the more promi-nent, alternations listed there and characterize themin terms of changes in denotation and valency of theverbs.4.1 A l te rnat ions  as mean ing  extens ionsA simple way of treating alternations i using a sep-arate lexical entry for every configuration, but thatwould clearly miss the linguistic generalizations.
In-stead, we wish to represent he common "kernel" ofthe different configurations only once, and use a setof lexical rules to derive the alternation possibilities.Jackendoff \[1990\] is concerned with this problem for anumber of alternations; pecifically, in his LCS frame-work he seeks to explain the relationships between sta-tive, inchoative, and causative readings of a verb (suchas those of to fill given above).
In Jackendoff's anal-ysis, the forms are derived sequentially by embeddingin the primitives INCH and CAUSE, respectively:?
stative: BE(\[Thin9 \](A}, \[INa \[Thing \]A \])?
inchoative: INCH \[BE(\[Thin9 \](A), lINd \[Thing \]A\])\]?
causative: CAUSE(\[Thi,g \]A, INCH \[BE(\[Th~,g\](A), \[IN,, \[Z,,i,g \]a \])\]For our NLG purposes, the idea of deriving complexverb configurations from more basic ones is attractive,but it is necessary that we relate verb meaning to ourexplicit treatment of event structure, instead of mask-ing that structure with a primitive like INCH.
Theidea is to see verb alternations not just as relations be-tween different verb forms, but to add directionality tothe concept of alternation and treat them as functionsthat map one into another.
From this viewpoint, thereare two groups of alternations: (1) Alternations thatdo not affect the denotation of the verb.
Examples arethe passive or the substance-source alternation (Thetank leaked oil; Oil leaked from the tank): The truthconditions do not change.
(2) Alternations that dochange the denotation of the verb.The critical group is (2), because if we derive verbconfigurations from others and rewrite the denotationin this process, it has to be ensured that the pro-cess is monotonic.
Therefore we define the direction-ality for group (2) to the effect that an alternationalways adds meaning: the newly derived form commu-nicates more than the old form--the denotation getsextended.
This notion is different from the standard,non-directional way in which alternations are seen inlinguistics; to label the difference, we call alternationsof group (2) eztensions.
In this section, we will in-troduce a number of extension rules for which we cangive a clear definition in terms of Aktionsart features,as they were introduced in section 3.1.
These rulesextend the denotation of a verb and rewrite its PSem-Spec in parallel to reflect the change in valency; theresult is a new verbalization option, which can (lifterfrom the previous one in terms of coverage or attri-bution of salience (not discussed here).
The rules willbe conveniently simple to state, thanks to the uppermodel, which provides the right level of abstractionfrom syntax.We illustrate our goal with an example.
If a SitSpecencodes the situation of Tom removing all the water146from a tank, then the verb to drain is a candidatelexeme.
While it can appear in a number of differentconfigurations, we wish to match only one of its formsagainst the SitSpec, though.
This is the most basicone, denoting an ACTIVITY: The water drained fromthe tank.
Here, the case frame of the verb has toencode that from the tank is an optional constituent.Now, an extension rule has to systematically derivethe CAUSATIVE  form: Tom drained the water from thetank.
And also from the first configuration, anotherrule derives the RESULTATIVE reading, which adds theinformation that the tank ended up empty: The tankdrained of the water.
Here, of the water is an optionalconstituent.
To this last form, a causative xtensioncan apply and yield Tom drained the tank of the water.To compute these configurations automatically, wedefine an alternation or extension rule as a 5-tuplewith the following components:NAM: a unique name;DXT: extension of denor.ation;C0V: additions to the covering-list;R0C: role changes in PSemSpec;NR0: additional PSemSpec roles and fillers.The DXT contains the denotation subgraph that thenew verbalization has in addition to the old one.
Thesyntax is, of course, the same as that of the deno-tation of a lexical entry.
Specifically, it can containvariables; these can co-occur in the C0V list: the itemsthat the new verbalization covers in addition to thoseof the old one.
R0C is a list of pairs that exchangeparticipant role names or the UM-type in the PSem-Spec; this replacement can also change optionality.For example, (< :ac tee  > :ac tor )  means "replacethe term : ac tee  in the PSemSpec of the old verbaliza-tion, where it was optional, with : ac'eor, which is notoptional."
Finally, Nl:t0 contains new roles and fillersthat are to be added to the new PSemSpec; these willalso contain variables from the denotation extension.Applying such a rule to a verbalization option voworks as follows: Add the contents of DXT to the de-notation of vo, and match the new part against theSitSpec.
If it matches, make a copy vo' of vo andassign it a new name as well as the denotation justformed.
Add the C0V list, which has been instantiatedby the matching, to the covering-list of vo'.
Exchangethe role names in the PSemSpec of vo' as prescribedby Ft0C, and, importantly, in the order they appearthere.
Finally, add NR0 to the PSemSpec.4.2 Lex ica l  ru les  fo r  extens ionsS ta t ive - resu l ta t ive  Example: Water filled the tank/ The tank filled with water.
In discussing verbs thatdenote a STATE, Jackendoff \[1990\] points out that fill,cover, surround, and saturate can describe either aSTATE or an inchoative vent, and encodes the differ-ence with the primitive INCH we have shown in theintroduction to this section.
Our goal is to do withoutthe primitive, and to define the change in terms of theAktionsart of the verb; to this end, we use RESULTA-WIVE in the place of 'inchoative' (see section 3.1).On a similar matter, Levin \[1993\] describes the 'lo-catum subject' alternation, which for instance holdsbetween I filled the pail with water and Water filled thepail.
It thus relates a causative and a non-causativeform.
Levin states that the alternation applies to aclass of 'fill verbs', which are many more than the fourgiven by Jackendoff, and her alternation is not exactlythe one we need here, since it also involves a causativeform--deriving this, however, is in our framework aseparate step.What we need here is a mixture of Jackendoff's andLevin's insights: Several of Levin's fill verbs can beboth transitive and intransitive; and some of the in-transitive readings denote 'to become Xed'.
Amongthese verbs are fill, flood, soak, encrust, or saturate:The kitchen flooded with water means the same as Thekitchen be'came flooded with water.
For this subgroupof the fill verbs we define an extension rule that, derivesf rom a STATE reading a RESULTATIVE one.
Notice thatthis is different from Levin's ' locatum subject' alter-nation, since it, does not, involve a causer.NAM : s ta t ive - resu l ta t iveDXT: (event (Y (ACTIVITY X)))COV : (X Y)ROC: ((:actor :inclusive)(:acres :actor)(directed-action nondirected-action) )IR0:  ( )To illustrate the rule with an example, consider thedenotation and PSemSpec of the STATE reading of fill:DEN: (fill-state (CONTAINER A)(C0NTEIT B)(VALUE C))PSS: (x / directed-action :lax fill_el:actor B :acres A < :destination C >)When matching it against a SitSpec with a tank andwater, this yields the verbalization The water filledthe tank, covering only the POST-STATE of the Sit-Spec.
Now, the alternation rule extends the denota-tion to also covering the EVENT and the ACTIVITY thatbrings the filling about.
Applying the changes to thePSemSpec results in(x / nondirected-action :lax fill_el:inclusive B :actor A < :destination C >)from which PENMAN produces The tank was filledwith the water.147A few stative verbs cannot be RESULTATIVE with-out being also CAUSATIVE.
Consider to cover in theseexamples from Jackendoff:Snow covered the ground.
* The ground covered with snow.Bill covered the ground with snow.For these, a 'stative-culmination' extension derivesthe RESULTATIVE-\[-CAUSATIVE form directly from theSTATIVE one.
The rule is defined similar to the onegiven above, so we do not show it here.Causat ive  extens ions  Example: The napkin soaked/ Tom soaked the napkin.
Levin discusses a'causative/inchoative' alternation that, applies to alarge number of verbs.
The class formed by them issomewhat, heterogeneous with respect to the Aktion-sart, though; it contains for example to move as wellas to open.
The former is in its basic form DURATIVE(The cat moved), and the latter TRANSFORMATIVE(The door opened).
Accordingly, we split the alterna-tion in two, which only differ in the DXT component,reflecting the difference in Aktionsart.
The alternationadds a CAUSER to the denotation, makes the for-mer : ac tor  the new : actee ,  and accordingly changesthe overall UM-type from NONDIRECTED-ACTION toDIRECTED-ACTION, because there is now an ACTEEpresent,.|AM : durative-causativeDXT: (activity (CAUSER X))COY: ()ROC: ((:actor :ac tee)(nond i rec ted-act ion  d i rec ted-act ion)  )HRO: (:actor X)?AM: resultative-causativeDXT: (event (ACTIVITY (X (CAUSER Y))))COY: ()ROC: ((:actor :actee)(nondirected-action directed-action))|RO: (:actor Y)The first rule derives, for example, Tom moved the catfrom The cat moved, and the second Tom closed thedoor from The door closed.Locat ive  extens ions  Example: (a) Sally sprayed thewall with paint.
/(b) Sally sprayed paint onto the wall.We have mentioned the locative extension above; itscharacteristic s that configuration (a) of the verb con-veys that something is performed in a 'complete' or'holistic' manner, whereas configuration (b) lacks thisfacet of meaning.
Levin points out that this alterna-tion has received much attention in linguistics researchand notes that, in spite of the efforts, a satisfactorydefinition of the 'holistic'-facet has not been found.Jackendoff, in his treatment of the alternation, sug-gests encoding the 'holistiC feature in a primitive: theSally sprayed paint onto the wall.(spray.
l (CAUSER sally-l)(OBJECT paint-l)(PATH (path-1 (DESTINATION wall-l))))Sally sprayed the wall with paint.(eveat.
l (PRE-STATE (covered.state-!
(OBJECT wall-l)(VALUE (not 'covered))))(ACTIVITY (spray-I (CAUSER re&fly-l)(OBJECT paint- 1 )(PATH (path-I (DESTINATION wall-l)))))(POST-STATE (covered-etage-I (OBJECT wall.l)(VALUE 'covered))))Figure 3: SitSpecs for configurations of to sprayfimction ONa is a derivative of ON and means thatsomething 'distributively' covers a surface, e.g., thepaint covers all of the wall.
Introducing a primitive,though, amounts to conceding that no explanation interms that are already known can be given.
We can-not solve the question of 'holisticness', either, but wewant to point to the fact that the two verb configu-rations correlate with a change in Aktionsart: Sallysprayed paint onto the wall is durative (she can do itfor two hours), whereas Sally sprayed the wall withpaint is transformative (she can do it in two hours).That observation leads us to propose that the exampleis best analyzed as involving a mere ACTIVITY in thewith configuration, and an additional TRANSITION inthe onto configuration.
Hence, we assign two differ-ent SitSpecs for the sentences, one ACTIVITY and oneEVENT, as shown in figure 3.The crucial point now is that the first SitSpec isfully embedded in the second; this is in correspon-dence with the truth conditions: If Sally has sprayedthe wall with paint, then she also has sprayed paintonto the wall.
To generalize the correspondence toan extension rule, we need to assume in the domainmodel a concept like COMPLETION-STATE, which isto subsume all those STATES in the domain modelthat have "extreme" values: an empty bucket, a fullyloaded truck, and so forth.
The exact interpretationof COMPLETION-STATE is the open question that Levin\[1993\] referred to, and that 3ackendoff treated with his'a' subscript.
We do think, though, that an abstractSTATE in the domain model, which subsumes a rangeof the concrete STATES, is preferrable to introducing aprimitive on the linguistic level (unless the primitiveis relevant, for other linguistic phenomena s well).The following alternation rule applies to durativeverb readings that denote ACTIVITIES of somethingbeing moved to somewhere, and extends them to alsocover the POST-STATE, which must be subsumed byCOMPLETION-STATE.
In this way, it derives reading(a) from (b) in the spray example, and analogously forthe other verbs undergoing the alternation, e.g.
: Tomt (wrote X) \[ -..~+i~.... /mative-activit!
DUa~'n~ /\[(event(PRE-STATEX) -------'l ' 7\[ (POST-STATE NO T..-X2)..\[ / c~u~t~i;~.resultative- LO~A~CAUS^~V~ \[causative spray / /load/ locative/clear- / transitive(event(PRE-STATE X) \]\[ (ACTIVITY(CAUSER Y)) \[I REs~.w^~.c_~u~Ar~ /Figure 4: Dependency of extension rulesloaded hay onto the wagon / Tom loaded the wagonwith hay; Jill stuffed the feathers into the cushion /,Jill stuffed the cushion with tile feathers.
The PSem-Spec is modified as follows: The former :dest  inat  ion(wall) becomes the new :actee,  whereas the former: ac~ee (paint) now fills the role < : inc lus ive  >, andis optional there, because Jill stuffed the cushion isalso well-formed.HAM: locative-transitiveDXT : (event(MOVE (OBJECT X)(PATH (DESTINATION Y)))(POST-STATE (Z completion-state (OBJECT Y))))COV: (Z)KOC: ((:actee < :inclusive >)( : destinat ion : actee) )\]iRO: ()Most of this rule covers two kinds of locative alter-nation, which Levin distinguishes: the 'spray/load' al-ternation and the 'clear (transitive)' alternation.
Thelatter applies only to the verbs clear, clean, drain,empty and can be seen as the 'semantic inverse'of the spray/load alternation, because one group ofverbs denotes activities of placing something some-where, and the other describes activities of remov-ing something from somewhere; but both have thesame 'holistic' effect in one of the verb configura-tions.
For example, the rule derives Tom drained thecontainer of the water from Tom drained the waterfrom the container) Thus, the rule for the clear-2We ignore the role of the definite determiner here, which in148Denotation: (activity (OBJECT A)(PATH (SOURCE B)))PSemSpec: (xl / nondirected-action :lex drain_el:actor A :source B)(0) The water drained from the tank.Locative/clear-intransitive of (0):Denotat ion:  (event (ACTIVITY (OBJECT A)(PATH (SOURCE B)))(POST-STATE (C (OBJECT B))))PSemSpec: (xl / nondirected-action :lex drain_el:of-matter A :actor B)(1) The tank drained of the water.Durative-causative of (0):Denotat ion:  (ac t iv i ty  (OBJECT A)(PATH (SOURCE B))(CAUSER C))PSemSpec: (xl / directed-action :lex drain_el:actee A :source B :actor C)(2) Tom drained the water from the tank.Resultative-causative of (1):Denotat ion:  (event (ACTIVITY (OBJECT A)(PATH (SOURCE B))(CAUSER C))(POST-STATE (C (OBJECT B))) )PSemSpec: (xl / d i rec ted-act ion  : lex dra in_e l:o f -mat ter  A :actee B :actor  C)(3) Tom drained the tank of the water.Figure 5: Derivation of drain-configurationsalternation is the same as the one shown above, withthree exceptions: the keyword replacing :acl;ee is not<: inc lus ive> but <:o f -mat ter>,  the DESTINATIONin the denotation is a SOURCE, and correspondingly,the keyword :dest inat ion  is : source.The clear verbs, except for to clean, can in additionbe intransitive, and Levin states a separate alternationfor them.
For to dram, the first configuration is Thewater drained from the tank, and the second is eitherThe tank drained or ?The tank drained of the wa-ter.
According to Levin, "the intransitive form maybe best in the absence of the of-phrase" \[Levin 1993,p.
55\].
The SitSpec denoted by the first configurationis:The water drained from the tank.
(move-1 (OBJECT water - l )(PATH (path-1 (SOURCE tank- I ) ) ) )Note that our ducative-causative extension rule givenfact has critical influence on the 'holistic' interpretation of massflollns,above applies in this case and extends the coverage ofthe SitSpec to one corresponding to Tom drained thewater from the tank.
A rule that is parallel to thatfor the transitive case is given below; it derives ?Thetank drained of the water; since the < :of -ma'eter  >is optional, we can also produce The tank drained,which is, according to Levin, preferred.EAH: locative/cleex-intr~msitiveDXT: (event(MOVE (OBJECT X)(PATH (SOURCE Y)))(POST-STATE (Z complet ion -s ta te  (OBJECT Y))))COY: (Z)ROC: ( ( :ac tor  < :o f -mat ter  >)( : source  :ac tor ) )IR0: ()Summary  Tile extensions introduced now can applyin a sequential order to a verb.
Figure 4 provides asynopsis: The boxes contain the denotation patternsthat correspond to the Aktionsart feature, and therules transform a configuration with one Aktionsartinto another.
In this graph, every verb base form hasan entry point corresponding to the Aktionsart of itsmost basic configuration.
Examples: to fillis STATIVE,to drain is DURATIVE, tO open is TRANSFORMATIVE,to remove is RESULTATIVE-+-CAUSATIVE.
The "doublebox" in the middle is the entry point for both TRANS-FORMATIVE and RESULTATIVE verbs, but the incomingarrows produce RESULTATIVE forms.From the entry point of a verb, arcs can be followedand rules applied if the respective alternation is spec-ified in the lexical entry.
Returning to the exampleof to drain, figure 5 shows how the rules successivelyderive the various configurations.4.3 Examples :  lex ica l  ent r ies  for  verbsTo illustrate our treatment of valency, argumentlinking, and alternation/extension rules, figure 6shows excerpts from lexical entries of eight differentverbs.
Ttle information is arranged as follows: On theright-hand side is the case frame of the verb, written asthe SemSpec participant keywords (each starting witha colon).
Optional participants are enclosed in anglebrackets.
On the left-hand side are excerpts from thedenotation: the names of the roles whose fillers are co-indexed with the respective position in the case frame.Thus, the arrows give the argument linking for thebase form of the verb, which can be quite simple, asin open or move.
From the perspective of the domainmodel, the roles on the left-hand side of the arrowsare required to be fil led--as is encoded in the LOOMdefinitions of the underlying concept.
Only items ap-pearing with an asterisk in front of them are optionalin the SitSpec: for example, a SitSpec underlying an149DISCONNECTCAUSER ?

MOOSE produces a range of dif-ferent paraphrases for the same underlying SitSpec,and one instrument o that end is the generation ofseveral verb configurations.
We proposed a set of al-ternation/extension rules that  der ive such conf igura-t ions  f rom the  basic conf igurat ion - -wh ich  is the onlyone s tored  in the lexicon.
A l te rnat ions  are der ived byrewr i t ing  the par t ia l  SemSpec ,  and  in the case of ex-tens ions ,  add ing  a new subgraph to the denotat ion ,and possibly adding nodes to the covering-list.
Wehave shown that the entire alternation space for a verblike "to drain can be generated in this manner.150References\[Bach 1986\] E. Bach.
