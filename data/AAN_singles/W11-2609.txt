Therefore, like each wordnet in EWN,WordNet.PT has a general conceptual architecturestructured along the lines of the PrincetonWordNet (Miller et al 1990; Fellbaum 1998).For early strategic reasons concerningapplications, this project is being carried out on thebasis of manual work, assuring the accuracy andreliability of its results.Aiming at using the Portuguese WordNet inlanguage learning applications, among others, thestarting point for the specification of a fragment ofthe Portuguese lexicon, in the first phase of theproject (1999-2003), consisted in the selection of aset of semantic domains covering concepts withhigh productivity in daily life communication.
Theencoding of language-internal relations followed amixed top-down/bottom-up strategy for theextension of small local nets (Marrafa 2002).
Suchwork firstly focused on nouns, but has since thenbeen extended to all the main POS, a work whichhas resulted both in refining informationspecifications and increasing WordNet.PTcoverage (Amaro et al 2006; Marrafa et al 2006;Amaro 2009; Mendes 2009).Relational lexica, and wordnets in particular,play a leading role in machine lexical knowledgerepresentation.
Hence, providing Portuguese withsuch a rich linguistic resource, and particularlyPortuguese varieties not often considered in lexicalresources, is crucial, not only to researchersworking in contrastive studies or with the so-callednon-standard varieties, but also to the generalpublic, as the database is made available forconsultation in the WWW through an intuitive andperspicuous web interface.
Such work is alsoparticularly relevant as the resulting database canbe extensively used in a vast range of language-based applications, able to cover, this way, allPortuguese varieties.This paper depicts the work developed and theresults achieved under the scope of theWordNet.PTglobal project, funded by InstitutoCam?es, which, as mentioned above, aims atextending WordNet.PT to Portuguese varieties.702 The DataPortuguese is spoken in all five continents by over250 million speakers, according to recent studies,and is the official language of 8 countries: Angola,Brazil, Cape Verde, East Timor, Guinea Bissau,Mozambique, Portugal, and Sao Tome e Principe.Being spoken in geographically distant regions andby very different communities, both in terms ofsize and culture, Portuguese is naturally expectedto show variation.
Despite this, regional varietiesare far from being equally provided with linguisticresources representing their specificities, as mostresearch work is focused either on the Brazilian orthe European varieties1.In the work depicted here we aim at contributingto reverse this situation, considering that this kindof resource is particularly adequate to achieve thisgoal, since it allows for representing lexicalvariation in a very straightforward way: conceptsare the basic unit in wordnets, defined by a set oflexical conceptual relations with other concepts,and represented by the set of lexical expressions(tendentially all) that denote them.
We have toantecipate the possibility of different varietiesshowing distinct lexicalization patterns,particularly some lexical gaps or lexicalizations ofmore specific concepts.
This is straightforwardlydealt with in the WordNet model: once a system ofrelevant tags has been implemented in the databasein order to identify lexical expressions with regardto their corresponding varieties, lexical gaps aresimply encoded by not associating the tag of thevariety at stake to any of the variants in the synset;specific lexicalizations, on the other hand, areadded to the network as a new node and associatedto the variety tag at stake.Our approach consisted in extracting 10 000concepts from WordNet.PT, and associating themwith the lexical expressions that denote them ineach Portuguese variety considered in this project.In order to accomplish this, we consulted nativespeakers from each of these varieties, resident intheir original communities, and asked them to1Official standardized versions of East Timorese and Africanvarieties of Portuguese essentially correspond to that ofEuropean Portuguese.
Moreover, these varieties are notprovided with dedicated lexical resources, such as dictionariesor large-scale corpora.
Being so, speakers in these regionsgenerally use European Portuguese lexical resources, whichonly exceptionally cover lexical variants specific to thesevarieties.pinpoint the expressions used for denoting theaforementioned 10 000 concepts.
Informants wereselected by Instituto Cam?es among undergradstudents in Portuguese studies and supervised byPortuguese lectors in each local university.
Besidesthe European Portuguese variety, which is alreadyencoded in WordNet.PT, specifications for sixother Portuguese varieties were integrated in thedatabase 2 : Angolan Portuguese, BrazilianPortuguese, Cape Verdean Portuguese, EastTimorese Portuguese, Mozambican Portuguese andSao Tome e Principe Portuguese.
For eachconcept, several lexicalizations were identified andboth the marked and unmarked expressionsregarding usage information3 were considered andidentified.2.1 Data selectionAs mentioned above, our approach for enrichingWordNet.PT with lexicalizations from allPortuguese varieties consisted in extracting 10 000concepts from WordNet.PT and associating themto the lexical expressions which denote them ineach variety.domain nouns verbs adjectives propernounstotalart 422 14 83 0 519clothes 467 62 74 0 603communication 314 151 106 82 653education 536 37 30 82 685food 1131 130 115 0 1376geography 281 0 166 200 647health 1159 92 175 0 1426housing 595 28 46 0 669human activities 641 0 0 0 641human relations 620 189 100 0 909living things 1597 113 119 1 1830sports 480 34 23 2 539transportation 659 562 67 30 659all domains 7893 802 1022 284 10001domain overlap 10,36% 12,54% 4,22% 22,62% 10,35%Table 1: concepts extended to Portuguese varieties2All Portuguese varieties spoken in countries wherePortuguese is the official language were considered.
However,for the time being, data from Guinean Portuguese are not yetencoded in the WordNet.PTglobal database due to difficulties inmaintaining a regular contact with the native speakersconsulted.
Despite this, we still hope to be able to include thisvariety in the database at some point in the future.3Informants were provided with a limited inventory of usagemarkers: slang; vulgar; informal; humerous; popular; unusual;regional; technical; old-fashioned.71The semantic domain approach initially used indeveloping WordNet.PT, provided us with anatural starting point for the selection of data to beconsidered in this project.
The table above presentsthe distribution, per POS and semantic domain4, ofthe WordNet.PT concepts extended to non-European Portuguese varieties.2.2 Data implementationOnce the data described above were presented tothe native speakers consulted and their inputorganized, all the information obtained wasincorporated in the database.This way, for a concept like bus (publictransportation which has regular pre-establishedstops at short intervals, typically operating withincities), for instance, the following lexicalizationswere obtained: autocarro, machibombo,machimbombo, ?nibus, and micro?nibus.Autocarro was found to be the more commonexpression used for denoting the concept at stakein Angola, Cape Verde, East Timor, Portugal, SaoTome e Principe and Mozambique.
However, thisvariant is marked as ?unusual?
in Mozambiquevariety.
Machibombo and machimbombo are onlyused in Mozambique, whereas ?nibus andmicro?nibus are only used in Brazil.
With this kindof data at hand, each lexicalization was taggedwith regard to the varieties in which it is used and,for each variety, associated, when relevant, to ausage label, as illustrated below.In the codification of the aforementionedinformation we used Synsetter ?

This results in partialoverlaps between semantic domains, whose extent is presentedin the last row of Table 1.innovative research results in WordNet.PT.
Inorder to do so, this computational tool has beendeveloped to straightforwardly allow for updatesand improvements.
In the specific case of the taskaddressed in this paper, extending the coverage ofthe WordNet.PT database to lexicalizations ofdifferent Portuguese varieties involved the designof additional features regarding the identificationof Portuguese varieties and variety-dependentusage label encoding.2.3 The resultsEncoding the data obtained in WordNet.PTglobalextends a relevant fragment of WordNet.PT toPortuguese varieties other than EuropeanPortuguese.
This way, researchers are providedwith a crucial database for developing contrastivestudies on the lexicon of different Portuguesevarieties or research on a specific Portuguesevariety, just to mention a possible application.
Thetable below presents the distribution of variants pervariety in the fragment of the lexicon considered,making apparent, for instance, that in the collectionof data considered in this project some varietieshave more synonym forms for denoting the sameconcept than others (see average of variants perconcept).Portuguesevarietiesnumber ofconceptsnumber ofvariantsvariants perconcept (average)Angola 10 000 11713 1,17Brazil 10 000 12060 1,20Cape Verde 10 000 12563 1,26East Timor 10 000 12131 1,21Mozambique 10 000 11740 1,17Portugal 10 000 13006 1,30Sao Tome ePrincipe 6981 9552 1,37all varieties 10 000 14751 1,47Naturally, this is only an overall view of theresults obtained.
The new extended WordNet.PTversion is also a crucial resource allowing forcontrastive studies on lexicalization patternsdepending on semantic domains or on frequency ofuse, for instance, for all or for specific Portuguesevarieties.In order to make these data publicly available, anew WordNet.PT version, the WordNet.PTglobal hasbeen released on the WWW 5 .
Releasing theWordNet.PT fragment extended to Portuguese5http://www.clul.ul.pt/wnglobal.72varieties online involved developing an updatedversion of the web interface for wordnet onlinenavigation.
In Section 3 we present the mainfeatures of this web interface and how users cannavigate and straightforwardly access the data onPortuguese varieties.3 Navigating the lexicon of Portuguesevarieties onlineThe new updated version of the web interface forwordnet navigation was developed with specificfeatures allowing for the visualization ofinformation on Portuguese varieties and fornarrowing down searches depending on the needsof the user.
Among the most salient aspects of thenew web interface we underline the following:allowing the user to restrict the search to a given(or to a set of) Portuguese variety(ies) (see captionbelow); displaying information about each lexicalexpression regarding the varieties which use it andwhether this use is marked or not.Going back to the example mentioned in section2.2, in Portuguese, the concept {bus} can bedenoted by several expressions, depending on thevariety considered.
This information isstraightforwardly displayed and made available tothe user by a simple system of tags, as illustratedbelow.Also, all marked uses are indicated byunderlining the variety label corresponding to thevariety in which the use of the relevant expressionis marked (see tags associated to autocarro in thecaption above, particularly the MZ tag signaled byan arrow).
By clicking on this label the relevantusage label is displayed, as illustrated below.4 Final RemarksWordNet.PTglobal is, thus, a relational lexiconallowing for modelling the lexicon of Portuguesevarieties in a consistent and motivated way.Covering 10 000 concepts, lexicalized by a totalof 14 751 expressions representing all the mainPOS (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and proper nouns),WordNet.PTglobal also provides a lexical-conceptualnetwork of relations establishing the relevant linksbetween each concept and the other concepts in thenet, in a total of more than 30 000 relations,including relations with their correspondinglexicalizations in English.This way, Portuguese now has a rich and usefullexical resource covering all of its varieties(Angolan, Brazilian, Cape Verdean, EastTimorese, European, Mozambican, Sao Tome ePrincipe and Guinean Portuguese (forthcoming ?see footnote 1)), freely available for onlineconsultation both to researchers and to the generalpublic.Moreover, the database presented in this papercan be extensively used in a vast range oflanguage-based applications which are now able tocover all Portuguese varieties.
As a final remark onfuture work, the data resulting fromWordNet.PTglobal can be used as a basis forcomparative studies regarding, for instance, variantdistribution per variety.
Note, however, thatpursuing such studies requires comparable corporafor each variety, both with POS tagging andsemantic annotation.
