In a project to build corpora containing corefer-ence links between events, we have identified three levels of event identity (full, partial, and none).
Event coreference annotation on two cor-pora was performed to validate the findings.
1 The Problem of Identity Last year we had HLT in Montreal, and this year we did it in Atlanta.
Does the ?did it?
refer to the same conference or a different one?
The two conferences are not iden-tical, of course, but they are also not totally unre-lated?else the ?did it?
would not be interpretable.
When creating text, we treat instances of entities and events as if they are fixed, well-described, and well-understood.
When we say ?that boat over there?
or ?Mary?s wedding next month?, we as-sume the reader creates a mental representation of the referent, and we proceed to refer to it without further thought.
However, as has been often noted in theoretical studies of semantics, this assumption is very prob-lematic (Mill, 1872; Frege 1892; Guarino, 1999).
Entities and (even more so) events are complex composite phenomena in the world, and they un-dergo change.
1 This work was supported by grants from DARPA and NSF, as well as by funding that supported Prof. M. Felisa Vedejo from UNED Madrid.Since nobody has complete knowledge, the au-thor?s mental image of the entity or event in ques-tion might differ from the reader?s, and from the truth.
Specifically, the properties the author as-sumes for the event or entity might not be the ones the reader assumes.
This difference has deep con-sequences for the treatment of the semantic mean-ing of a text.
In particular, it fundamentally affects how one must perform coreference among entities or events.
As discussed in Section 6, events have been the focus of study in both Linguistics and NLP (Chen and Ji, 2009; Bejan and Harabagiu, 2008, 2010; Humphreys et al 1997).
Determining when two event mentions in text corefer is, however, an un-solved problem2.
Past work in NLP has avoided some of the more complex problems by consider-ing only certain types of coreference, or by simply ignoring the major problems.
The results have been partial, or inconsistent, annotations.
In this paper we describe our approach to the problem of coreference among events.
In order to build a corpus containing event coreference links that is annotated with high enough inter-annotator agreement to be useful for machine learning, it has proven necessary to create a model of event identi-ty that is more elaborate than is usually assumed in the NLP literature, and to formulate quite specific definitions for its central concepts.
2 In this work, we mean both events and states when we say ?event?.
A state refers to a fixed, or regularly changing, con-figuration of entities in the world, such as ?it is hot?
or ?he is running?.
An event occurs when there is a change of state in the world, such as ?he stops running?
or ?the plane took off?.21Event coreference is the problem of determin-ing when two mentions in a text refer to the ?same?
event.
Whether or not the event actually occurred in reality is a separate issue; a text can describe people flying around on dragons or broomsticks.
While the events might be actual occurrences, hy-pothesized or desired ones, etc., they exist in the text as Discourse Elements (DEs), and this is what we consider in this work.
Each DE is referred to (explicitly or implicitly) in the text by a mention, for example ?destroy?, ?the attack?, ?that event?, or ?it?.
But it is often unclear whether two mentions refer to the same DE or to closely related ones, or to something alto-gether different.
The following example illustrates two principal problems of event coreference:  While Turkish troops have been fighting_E.1 a Kurdish faction in northern Iraq, two other Kurdish groups have been battling_E.2 each other.
A radio station operated_E.3 by the Kurdistan Democratic Party said_E.4 the party's forces attacked_E.5 positions of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan on Monday in the Kurdish re-gion's capital Irbil.
The Voice of Iraqi Kurdistan radio, moni-tored_E.6 by the British Broadcasting Corp., said_E.7 more than 80 Patriotic Union fight-ers were killed_E.8 and at least 150 wound-ed_E.9.
The fighting_E.10 was also reported_E.11 by a senior Patriotic Union official, Kusret Rasul Ali, who said_E.12 PUK forces re-pelled_E.13 a large KDP attack_E.14.
?
Ali claimed_E.16 that 300 KDP fighters were killed_E.17 or wounded_E.18 and only 11 Patriotic Union members died_E.19.
Problem 1: Partial event overlap.
Event E.2, ?battling each other?, refers to an ongoing series of skirmishes between two Kurdish groups, the KDP and the PUK.
Since one of these battles, where the KDP attacked positions of the PUK, is E.5, it is natural to say that E.2 and E.5 corefer.
However, E.2 clearly denotes other battles as well, and there-fore E.5 and E.2 cannot fully corefer.
In another example, event E.8 refers to the killing of a num-ber of soldiers as part of this fight E.5, and event E.9 to the wounding of others.
Both events E.8and E.9 constitute an intrinsic part of the attack E.5, and hence corefer to it, but are each only part of E.5, and hence neither can fully corefer to it.
Problem 2: Inconsistent reporting.
This news fragment contains two reports of the fight: E.5 and E.10.
Since E.10 describes E.5 from the perspec-tive of a senior PUK official, it should corefer to E.5.
But where the KDP?s report claims more than 80 PUK fighters killed (event E.8, part of E.5), the PUK official said that only 11 PUK members died (event E.19, part of E.10).
Without taking into account the fact that the two killing events are re-ports made by different speakers, it would not be possible to recognize them as coreferent.
Examples of partial event overlap and incon-sistent reporting are common in text, and occur as various types.
In our work, we formally recognize partial event overlap, calling it partial event identi-ty, which permits different degrees and types of event coreference.
This approach simplifies the coreference problem and highlights various inter-event relationships that facilitates grouping events into ?families?
that support further analysis and combination with other NLP system components.
In this paper, we introduce the idea that there are three degrees of event identity: fully identical, qua-si-identical, and fully independent (not identical).
Full identity reflects in full coreference and quasi-identity in partial coreference.
Fully independent events are singletons.
Our claims in this paper are:  ?
Events, being complex phenomena, can corefer fully (identity) or partially (quasi-identity).
?
Event coreference annotation is considera-bly clarified when partial coreference is allowed.
?
A relatively small fixed set of types of quasi-identity suffices to describe most of them.
?
Different domains and genres highlight different subsets of these quasi-identity types.
?
Different auxiliary knowledge sources and texts are relevant for different types.
2 Types of Full and Partial Identity Def: Two mentions fully corefer if their activi-ty/event/state DE is identical in all respects, as far as one can tell from their occurrence in the text.
(In particular, their agents, location, and time are identical or compatible.)
One can distinguish sev-eral types of identity, as spelled out below.22Def: Two mentions partially corefer if activi-ty/event/state DE is quasi-identical: most aspects are the same, but some additional information is provided for one or the other that is not shared.
There are two principal types of quasi-identity, as defined below.
Otherwise, two mentions do not corefer.
2.1 Full Identity  Mention1 is identical to mention2 iff there is no semantic (meaning) difference between them.
Just one DE, and exactly the same aspects of the DE, are understood from both mentions in their con-texts.
It is possible to replace the one mention with the other without any semantic change (though some small syntactic changes might be required to ensure grammaticality).
Note that mention2 may contain less detail than mention1 and remain iden-tical, if it carries over information from mention1 that is understood / inherited from the context.
However, when mention2 provides more or new information not contained in mention1 or naturally inferred for it, then the two are no longer identical.
Usually, exact identity is rare within a single text, but may occur more often across texts.
We identi-fy the following types:  1.
Lexical identity: The two mentions use exactly the same senses of the same word(s), in-cluding derivational words (e.g., ?destroy?, ?de-struction?).
2.
Synonym: One mention?s word is a syno-nym of the other?s word.
3.
Wide-reading: One mention is a synonym of the wide reading of the other (defined below, under Quasi-identity:Scriptal).
For example, in ?the attack(E1) took place yesterday.
The bomb-ing(E2) killed four people?, E1 and E2 are fully coreferent only when ?bombing?
is read in its wide sense that denotes the whole attack, not the narrow sense that denotes just the actual exploding of the bomb.
4.
Paraphrase: One mention is a paraphrase of the other.
Here some syntactic differences may occur.
Some examples are active/passive trans-formation (?she gave him the book?
/ ?he was giv-en the book by her?
), shifts of perspective that do not add or lose information (?he went to Boston?
/ ?he came to Boston?
), etc.
No extra semantic in-formation is provided in one mention or the other.5.
Pronoun: One mention refers deictically to the DE, as in (?the party?
/ ?that event?
), (?the election [went well]?
/ ?it [went well]?).
2.2  Quasi-identity  Mention1 is quasi- (partially) identical to mention2 iff they refer to the ?same?
DE but one mention includes information that is not contained in the other, not counting information understood/inhe-rited from the context.
They are semantically not fully identical, though the core part of the two mentions is.
One mention can replace the other, but some information will be changed, added, or lost.
(This is the typical case between possible coreferent mentions within a document.)
We distinguish between two core types of partial identity: Membership and Subevent.
The essential difference between the two is which aspects of the two events in question differ.
Member-of obtains when we have two instances of the same event that differ in some particulars, such as time and loca-tion and [some] participants (agents, patients, etc).
In contrast, Subevent obtains when we have differ-ent events that occur at more or less the same place and time with the same cast of participants.
Membership: Mention1 is a set of similar DEs (multiple instances of the same kind of event), like several birthday parties, and mention2 is one or more of them.
More precisely, we say that an event B is a member of A if: (i) A is a set of mul-tiple instances of the same type of event (and hence its mention usually pluralized); (ii) B?s DE(s) is one or more (but not all) of them; (iii) ei-ther or both the time and the place of B?s DE(s) and (some of) A?s DEs are different.
For example, in ?I attended three parties(E1) last month.
The first one(E2) was the best?, E2 is a member of E1.
The relation that links the single instance to the set is member-of.
Subevent: The DE of mention1 is a script (a ste-reotypical sequence of events, performed by an agent in pursuit of a given goal, such as eating at a restaurant, executing a bombing, running for elec-tion), and mention2 is one of the actions/events executed as part of that script (say, paying the waiter, or detonating the bomb, or making a cam-paign speech).
More precisely, we say that an event B is a subevent of an event A if: (i) A is a complex sequence of activities, mostly performed by the same (or compatible) agent; (ii) B is one of23these activities; and (iii) B occurs at the same time and place as A.
Here A acts as a kind of collector event.
Often, the whole script is named by the key event of the script (for example, in ?he planned the explosion?, the ?explosion?
signifies the whole script, including planning, planting the bomb, the detonation, etc.
; but the actual detonation event itself can also be called ?the explosion?).
We call the interpretation of the mention that refers to the whole script its wide reading, and the interpreta-tion that refers to just the key subevent the narrow reading.
It is important not to confuse the two; a wide reading and a narrow reading of a word can-not corefer3.
The relation that links the narrow reading DE to the wide one is sub-to.
Several aspects of the events in question provide key information to differentiate between members and subevents:   1.
Time: When the time of occurrence of mention1 is temporally ?close enough?
to the time of occurrence of mention2, then it is likely that one is a Subevent of the other.
More precisely, we say that an event B is a subevent of event A if: (i) A and B are both events; (ii) the mentions of A and B both refer to the same overall DE; and (iii) the time of occurrence of B is contained in the time of oc-currence of A.
But if (i) and (ii) hold but not (iii), and A is a set of events (plural), then B is a mem-ber of A.
(In (Humphreys et al 1997), any varia-tion in time automatically results in a decision of non-coreference.)
2.
Space/location: The location of mention1 is spatially ?close enough?
to the location of men-tion2.
More precisely, we say that an event B is a subevent of event A if: (i) A and B are both events; (ii) the mentions of A and B both refer to the same overall DE; and (iii) the location of oc-currence of B is contained in, or overlaps with, or abuts the location of occurrence of A.
But if (i) and (ii) hold but not (iii), and A is a set of events (plural), then B is a member of A.3 For example, in ?James perpetrated the shooting.
He was arrested for the attack?, ?shooting?
is used in its wide sense and here is coreferent with ?attack?, since it applies to a whole sequence of events.
In contrast, ?James perpetrated the shoot-ing.
He is the one who actually pulled the trigger?, ?shooting?
is used in its narrow sense to mean just the single act.
Typi-cally, a word with two readings can corefer (i.e., be lexically or synonymically identical to) another in the same reading only.3.
Event participants: Mention1 and men-tion2 refer to the same DE but differ in the overall cast of participants involved.
In these cases, the member relation obtains, and can be differentiated into subtypes, since participants of events can dif-fer in several ways.
For example, if: (i) the men-tions of events A and B refer to the same overall DE; and (ii) the participants (agents, patients, etc.)
of mention2 are a subset of the participants of mention1, as in ?the crowd demonstrated on the square.
Susan and Mary were in it?, then event B is a participant-member of event A.
In another ex-ample, event B is a participant-instance-member of event A if: (i) the mentions of events A and B refer to the same overall DE; and (ii) one or more of the participants (agents, patients, etc.)
of men-tion2 is/are an instance of the participants of men-tion1, as in ?a firebrand addressed the crowd on the square.
Joe spoke for an hour?, where Joe is the firebrand.
There are other ways in which two mentions may refer to the same DE but differ from one an-other.
Usually these differences are not semantic but reflect an orientation or perspective difference.
For example, one mention may include the speak-er?s evaluation/opinion, while the other is neutral, as in ?He sang the silly song.
He embarrassed himself?, or the spatial orientation of the speaker, as in ?she went to New York?
/ ?she came to New York?.
We treat these cases as fully coreferent.
Sometimes it is very difficult to know whether two mentions are bidirectionally implied, meaning that the two must corefer, or whether they are only quasi-identical (i.e., one entails the other but not vice versa).
For example, in ?he had a heart at-tack?
/ ?he died?, the two mentions are not identi-cal because one can have a heart attack and not die from it.
In contrast, ?he had a fatal heart attack?
/ ?he died from a heart attack?
are identical.
In ?she was elected President?
/ ?she took office as Presi-dent?, it is more difficult to decide.
Does being elected automatically entail taking office?
In some political systems it may, and in others it may not.
When in doubt, we treat the case as only quasi-identical.
Thus, comparing to examples from Full-Identity: Paraphrase, the following are only quasi-identical because of additional information: ?she sold the book?
/ ?she sold Peter the book?
; ?she sold Peter the book?
/ ?Peter got [not bought] the book from her?.24Quasi-identity has been considered in corefer-ence before in (Hasler et al 2006) but not as ex-tensively, and in (Recasens and Hovy, 2010a; 2011) but applied only to entities.
When applied to events, the issue becomes more complex.
3 Two Problems  3.1 Domain and Reporting Events  As described above, inconsistent reporting occurs when a DE stated in reported text contains signifi-cant differences from the author?s description of the same DE.
To handle such cases we have found it necessary to additionally identify communication events, which we call Reportings, during annotation be-cause they provide a context in which a DE is stat-ed.
We identify two principal types of Reporting verbs: locutionary verbs ?say?, ?report?, ?an-nounce?, etc.)
and Speech Acts (?condemn?, ?promise?, ?support?, ?blame?, etc.).
Where the former verbs signal merely a telling, the latter verbs both say and thereby do something.
For ex-ample in the following paragraph, ?admitted?
and ?say?
are communication events:  Memon admitted_R.7,in-sayR.3 his in-volvement in activities_E.8,in-sayR.3 in-volving an explosives-laden van near the president's motorcade, police said_R.3?.
Sometimes the same event can participate in-side two reporting events, as in   ?The LA Times lauded_R.1 the decision_E.2,in-sayR.1,in-sayR.3, which the NY Times lampooned_R.3.
Though an added annotation burden, the link from a DE to a reporting event allows the analyst or learning system to discount apparent contradictory aspects of the DE and make more accurate identity decisions.
3.2 Unclear Semantics of Events  Sometimes it is difficult to determine the exact relationships between events since their semantics is unclear.
In the following, is E.45 coreferent to E.44, or only partially?
If so, how?
Amnesty International has accused both sides of violating_E.44 international humanitarian law by targeting_E.45 civilian areas, and ...We decided that E.44 is not fully coreferent with E.45, since violating is not the same as targeting.
Also, E.45 is not a subevent of E.44 since ?violat-ing?
is not a script with a well-defined series of steps, does not trigger ?targeting?, and does not occur before ?targeting?.
Rather, targeting is a certain form or example of violation/violating.
(It might be easier if the sentence were: ?...
of violat-ing international humanitarian law by targeting civilian areas and the human rights group, by kill-ing civilians, and by....?.
As such E.45 could be interpreted as a member of E.44, interpreting the latter as a series of violations.)
4 Annotation  To validate these ideas we have been annotating newspaper texts within the context of a large pro-ject on automated deep reading of text.
This pro-ject combines Information Extraction, parsing, and various forms of inference to analyze a small num-ber of texts and to then answer questions about them.
The inability of current text analysis engines to handle event coreference has been a stumbling block in the project.
By creating a corpus of texts annotated for coreference we are working to enable machine learning systems to learn which features are relevant for coreference and then ultimately to perform such coreference as well.
We are annotating two corpora: 1.
The Intelligence Community (IC) Corpus contains texts in the Violent Events domain (bombings, killings, wars, etc.).
Given the relative scarcity of the partial coreference subtypes, we annotated only instances of full coreference, Subevent, and Member relations.
To handle Subevents one needs an unambiguous definition of the scripts in the domain.
Fortunately this domain offers a manageable set of events (our event ontol-ogy comprises approximately 50 terms) with a subevent structure that is not overly complex but still realistic.
We did not find the need to exceed three layers of scriptal granularity, as in  campaign > {bombing, attack} > {blast, kill, wound}.
2.
The Biography (Bio) Corpus contains texts describing the lives of famous people.
Typically, these texts are written when the person dies or has some notable achievement.
Given the complexi-ties of description of artistic and other creative achievements, we restrict our corpus to achieve-25ments in politics, science, sports, and other more factual endeavors.
More important than scriptal granularity in this domain is temporal sequencing.
We obtained and modified a version of the An-CoraPipe entity coreference annotation interface (Bertran et al 2010) that was kindly given us by the AnCora team at the University of Barcelona.
We implemented criteria and an automated method for automatically identifying domain and reporting events.
We also created a tool to check and dis-play the results of annotation, and technology to deliver various agreement scores.
Using different sets of annotators (from 3 to 6 people per text), we have completed a corpus of 100 texts in the IC domain and are in process of annotating the Bio corpus.
Our various types of full and partial coreference and the associated an-notation guidelines were developed and refined over the first third of these documents.
Table 1 shows statistics and inter-annotator agreement for the remaining 65 articles.
The aver-age number of domain and reporting events per article is 41.2.
We use Fleiss?s kappa since we have more than two annotators per article.
The (rather low) score for member coreference is not really reliable given the small number of instances.
Avg no per article Agreement (Fleiss?s kappa) Full coreference relations Member coreference relations Subevent coreference relations 19.5 0.620 2.7 0.213 7.2 0.467 Table 1: Annotation statistics and agreement.
5 Validation and Use To validate the conceptualization and definitions of full and partial identity relations, we report in (Araki et al 2013) a study that determines correla-tions between the Member and Subevent relation instances and a variety of syntactic and lexico-semantic features.
The utility of these features to support automated event coreference is reported in the same paper.
We are now developing a flexible recursive pro-cedure that integrates coreference of events and of their pertinent participants (including locations and times).
This procedure employs inference in addi-tion to feature-based classification to compensate for the shortcomings of each method alone.6 Relevant Past Work The problem of identity has been addressed by scholars since antiquity.
In the intensional ap-proach (for example, De Saussure, 1896) a concept is defined as a set of attributes (differentiae), that serve to distinguish it from other concepts; two concepts are identical iff all their attributes and values are.
In the extensional approach (Frege, 1982) a concept can be defined as the set of all in-stances of that concept; two concepts are identical when their two extensional sets are.
Given the impossibility of either approach to support practical work, AI scholars have devoted some attention to so-called Identity Criteria.
Gua-rino (1999) outlines several ?dimensions?
along which entities can remain identical or change un-der transformations; for example, a glass before and after it is crushed is identical with respect to its matter but not its shape; the ACL now and one hundred years hence is (probably) identical as an organization but not in its membership.
There has not been much theoretical work on semantic identity in the NLP community.
But there has been a considerable amount of work on the problem of coreference.
Focusing on entity coreference are (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Cu-lotta et al 2007; Ng, 2007; Ng, 2009; Finkel and Manning, 2008; Ng, 2009).
Focusing on event coreference are (Humphries et al 1997; Chen and Zi, 2009; Bejan and Harabagiu, 2008; 2010).
Anaphora and bridging reference are discussed in (Poesio and Artstein, 2005; 2007).
Relevant to events is the TIME-ML corpus (Mani and Pustejovsky, 2004; Pustejovsky et al 2003), which provides a specification notation for events and temporal expressions.
Several corpora contain annotations for entity coreference, including the Prague Dependency Treebank (Ku?ov?
and Haji?ov?.
2004), the ACE corpus (Walker et al 2006), and OntoNotes (Pra-dhan et al 2007).
Most similar to our work is that of (Hasler et al 2006).
In that study, coreferential events and their arguments (also coreference between the argu-ments) were annotated for the terrorism/security domain, considering five event categories (attack, defend, injure, die, contact), and five event clusters (Bukavu bombing, Peru hostages, Tajikistan hos-tages, Israel suicide bombing and China-Taiwan26hijacking).
They also annotated information about the kind of coreferential link, such as identity / synonymy / generalization / specialization / other.
Our work takes further the ideas of (Hasler et al 2006) and (Recasens et al 2011) in elaborating the types of full and partial identity, as they are manifest in event coreference.
7 Conclusion The problem of entity and event identity, and hence coreference, is challenging.
We provide a definition of identity and two principal types of quasi-identity, with differentiation based on differ-ences in location, time, and participants.
We hope that these ideas help to clarify the problem and im-prove inter-annotator agreement.
