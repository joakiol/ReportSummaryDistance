Although some prefer to treatthem as exceptional cases that should re-quire some extra mechanism (as for ellip-tical constructions), or to allow for unre-stricted cross-category coordination, theycan be naturally derived in a grammaticfunctional generative approach.
In thispaper we explore the ideia on how mix-ing syntactic categories and grammaticalfunctions in the label set of a Tree Adjoin-ing Grammar allows us to develop gram-mars that elegantly handle both the casesof same- and cross-category coordinationin an uniform way.1 IntroductionGenerative grammars that we commonly hearabout in computational linguistics are usuallybased on syntactic categories.
This is also the casewhen the formalism used is the Tree AdjoiningGrammars (TAGs).
Large scale handcrafted gram-mars for many languages have been built basedon this paradigm (Joshi, 2001; XTAG ResearchGroup, 2001; Kroch and Joshi, 1985; Abeille?and Candito, 2000; Candito, 1998; Becker, 1993;Frank, 2002; Joshi and Schabes, 1997; Abeille?and Rambow, 2000) as well as grammars extractedfrom corpora (Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000;Chiang, 2000; Hwa, 1999; Xia et al, 2001; Xia,2001).
The latter is partly due to the fact that largescale annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank(Marcus et al, 1994; Bies et al, 1995) give pri-macy to syntactic categories.
After all this is themost strongly sedimented generative approach atleast since (Chomsky, 1957).Computational approaches of grammar basedon grammatical function such as that of SusumuKuno (Kuno, 1987) have been given less impor-tance.
Although we can think of simply insertingfunctional labels in elementary trees or use themin a meta-level to generate the grammar, such asin (Candito, 1998; Kinyon, 2000; Cle?ment andKinyon, 2003), such tags are generally not seenas an essential part of the derivational process.Nevertheless coordination is such an inherentlyfunctional phenomenon as we show next.
Con-sider the sentences in (1) and (2).
These are ex-amples of regular coordination between phrasesof the same category.
They can easily be handledin the traditional grammar approaches of syntacticcategory.
(1) She flew [PP on May 1st and on July 4th ].
(2) They sell [ADJP electric and electronic ]products.Now look at the cases in (3) and (4).
Theyare different in the sense that the coordination isacross categories.
This poses a strong problemto the traditional grammar of syntactic categories.This has been noticed for TAGs in (Prolo, 2002).Recently this has also been tackled in the HPSGframework by (Sag, 2003) and (Abeille?, 2004).The Penn Treebank calls this constituents UCP for?Unlike Coordinated Phrases?
(Bies et al, 1995).The problem is that we would need rules of thekind below (using context-free rules for short ?see (Prolo, 2002) for TAGs).
Basically all pairs ofconstituents can be coordinated but we can not as-sign to the resulting constituents either of the sub-constituent tags.137UCP ?
ADVP CC PPUCP ?
PP CC ADVPUCP ?
ADJP CC NPUCP ?
NP CC ADJP(3) She flew [??
yesterday and on July 4th ].
(4) They sell [??
electronic and computer ] de-vices.However, UCP coordination is not random.Two constituents can be coordinated only whenthey are fulfilling the same grammatical function(with respect to a third head).
In (3) they are play-ing the role of adverbial adjuncts of went.
Eitherone can engage in that relation individually andhence they can be coordinated while playing thatrole.
Likewise in (4) the adjective electronic andthe noun computer are both fine as left NP modi-fiers.
Therefore they can be conjoined as such.
Asa final example, consider the sentences in (5).
Be-cause the direct object of the verb know can be re-alized as either an NP or a sentential complement,they can be coordinated in that role as shown in(6).
(5) I know the answer.I know that you don?t know it.
(6) I know [ the answer and that you don?t knowit ].Clearly the recursive process of conjoining theconstituents is at the grammatic functional level.We show next how we can solve this problem el-egantly by mixing grammatical function and syn-tactic category in the set of symbols for the treenodes of a TAG.2 A Grammar of GrammaticalFunctions and Syntactic CategoriesThe elementary trees in our grammar are the pro-jection of a lexical item as usual in LexicalizedTAGs.
However, root nodes do not correspond tosyntactic categories, but to grammatical functions.The node for the function then dominates syntacticcategory nodes, according to the way the functionis realized syntactically.

Noticethat they adjoin at the function node (AdnAdjLeft)therefore allowing for the coordination of anythingthat can fulfill that role, be them equal categoriesas in (2) or the UCP case in (4).
In Figure 4we show an additional example with a PP rightNP modifier.
It should be straightforward to seehow to build trees for AdnAdjRight coordination ofconstituents realized by a PP or a relative clause.In Figure 5 we finally get to subcategorization.In any approach to grammar development we haveto make decisions between explicitly modelingcertain restrictions in the tree structure or throughfeatures (of a feature based TAG).
That can beseen ubiquitously in the XTAG grammar (XTAGResearch Group, 2001).
We can use the tree of thefigure with verbs such like eat and know, havingtrees to realize the direct object as either an NPor a sentence.
Features in the lexical items wouldprevent the derivation of eat with a sentential com-plement.
Another approach would be to furtherdetail the tree into one with a built in NP object1Figures generally show templates where a diamond indi-cates where the lexical item would be substituted in, thoughoccasionally we insert the lexical item itself.138AdnAdjLeftHHHHHHNP ?

How-ever, realization constraints would still have to bepresent to allow for the coordination of only theconstituents that are allowed for the specific verb.For the reader unfamiliar with grammar modelingwe notice this is not a drawback of the approach.Constraints beyond those represented in the struc-ture are constantly made as a way to avoid irra-tional growth of a grammar.In Figure 6 we show still another interestingcase: the predicative clauses.2 We include it for2Again this is one approach to modeling predicatives,MainSHHHSubj ?

Onecan easily see how to generate trees for coordi-nating NPs, PPs and ADJPs, as predicative con-stituents so as to allow for (7).
(7) John was [ a gentlemen, always happy, andnever in bad mood ].3 ConclusionsWe showed in this paper how to build a Tree Ad-joining Grammar of grammatical functions andsyntactic categories, mixed together in a princi-pled way of function and possible realizations.
Itbrings the benefits of allowing handling languagephenomena which are generative at each of thetwo sides.In particular, we showed how it solves the prob-lem of coordination of constituents of distinct syn-tactic categories.Elementary trees are not clumsy.
On the con-trary they bring additional information to thestructure with minimal addition of nodes.
This in-formation could otherwise be hidden in node fea-tures, which are generally used to represent infor-mation that would be costly to maintain explicit inthe tree structure.Finally we can see that this structure can be eas-ily incorporated in a supervised grammar infer-ence algorithm such as that of (Xia, 2001), pro-vided the annotated corpus has grammatical func-tion information.
In fact this is the case in the PennTreebank, and Xia?s algorithm allows it to be used3.
Inferring the different kinds of verbs, with re-spect to the functions they subcategorize for andwith the auxiliary verb be anchoring the tree and the predica-tive as a substitution node.
The alternative used in the XTAGgrammar of having the predicative head as anchor would bepossible as well.3The same is true of other algorithms such as (Chen andVijay-Shanker, 2000)?s.139their realizations is an important issue here, and isalso feasible (see (Kinyon and Prolo, 2002)).ReferencesAnne Abeille?
