Box 4 (Keskuskatu 8)FIN-00014 University of HelsinkiFinland1 IntroductionWe are concerned with grammar-based surface-syntactic analysis of running text.
Morphologicaland syntactic analysis is here based on tags that ex-press surface-syntactic relations between functionalcategories such as Subject, Modifier, Main verb etc.
;consider the following simple sentence:I PgOli @SUBJECTsee  V PRES @MAINVERBa ART @>Hbird li @OBJECTFULLSTOP2 Description of the parsing systemThe parsing system consists of the following modules:2.1 PreprocessorThe preprocessor normalises the input text, detectssentence boundaries and punctuation marks, andidentifies idioms and other fixed syntagms.2.2 Morphological analyserThe ENGTWOL morphological nalyser is a 55,000entry Koskenniemi-style morphological descriptionof English that assigns all recognised input wordforms with all possible morphological readings as adisjunctive list.Those words not recognised by the ENGTWOLanalyser are analysed by a heuristic module; part-of-speech readings are assigned on the basis of the formof the word (endings etc.
).The morphologically analysed sentences are en-riched with syntactic and word boundary ambigui-ties and converted into regular expressions by simpleawk programs.2.3 F in l te-State parserThe Finite-State parser transforms entences andrules into finite-state automata.
The parser com-putes the intersection ofthe sentence automaton andall rule automata; the intersection is the parse of thesentence.The grammar also contains aheuristic section thatcan be used to rank multiple analyses.3 Sample analysisThe sentence Its leadership was insulted by editorsgets two analyses, when no heuristics are applied:@@i t  <lionMod> PROM GEM SG3 @>I @l eadersh ip  li liOM S@be V PAST SGI.OR.3 VFIliinsu l t  <SVO> PCP2by PREPed i to r  li liON PLFULLSTOP@SUBJ @@AUX @@HV MAINC@ @@ADVL @@P< @@@@@@@i t  <lionNod> PRON {\]Eli SG3 @>lileadership li liOM SG @SUBJbe <SV> <SVC/N> <SVC/A>V PAST SGI.0R.3 VFIli @MV NAIl\[C@ @insu l t  PCP2 @SC @by PREP @ADVL/N< @edi tor  I liOM PL @P< @FULLSTOP @@Syntactic tags@>l i  determiner or premodif ier@SUBJ subject of a f in i te  clause@AUX auxiliary in a finite clause@MV main verb in a finite clauseMAIliC@ finite main clause@AD'~ adverbial@P< preposition complement@SC subject complement%ADVL/N< adverbial  or a postmodif ierof a nominalReferences\[Voutilainen and Tapanalnen, 1993\] Atro Voutilai-hen and Pasi Tapanainen.
