In p a r t i c u l a r ,  the homomorphic connectionbetween syntax and semantics which plays a c e n t r a l  r o l e  in Montague semantics(Montague (1974), Partee (1976) and a t t r i b u t e d  grammars f o r  programming languages(Knuth (1968)), plays a much l e s s e r  r o l e  i n  t e s t - s c o r e  semantics-a r o l e  representedin the main by a c o l l e c t i o n  of l o c a l  t r a n s l a t i o n  r u l e s  governing the use o f  modi-f i e r s ,  q u a l i f i e r s ,  q u a n t i f i e r s  and connectives.

A more detailed exposition and ad-ditional examples may be found in Zadeh (1981).BASIC ASPECTS OF TEST-SCORE SEMANTICSAs was stated earlier, the point of departure in test-score semantics is the assump-tion that any semantic entity may be represented as a system of elastic constraintson a collection of objects or derived objects in a universe of discourse.Assuming that each object may be characterized by one or more fuzzy relations, thecollection of objects in a universe of discourse may be identified with a collectionof relations which constitute a fuzzv relational database or.
equivalently, a statedescription (Carnap (1952)).
In this database, then, a derived'object would be char-acterized by one or more fuzzy relations which are derived from other relations inthe database by operations expressed in an appropriate relation-manipulating lan-guage.In more concrete terms, let SE denote a semantic entity, e.g., the propositionp 4 During much of the past decade Pat earned far more thanall of his close friends put together,whose meaning we wish to represent.
To this end, we must (a) identify the con-straints which are implicit or explicit in SE; (b) describe the tests which mustbe performed to ascertain the degree to which each constraint is satisfied; and(c) specify the manner in which the degrees in question or, equivalently, the par-tial test scores are to be aggregated to yield an overall test score.
In general,the overall test score would be represented as a vector whose components are num-bers in the unit interval or, more generally, possibility/probability distributionsover this interval.Spelled out in greater detail, the process of meaning-representation in test-scoresemantics involves three distinct phases.
In Phase 1, an explanatory databaseframe or EDF, for short, is constructed.
EDF consists of a collection of rela-tional frames each of which specifies the name of a relation, the names of its at-tributes and their respective domains,with the understanding that the meaning ofeach relation in EDF is known to the addressee of the meaning-representation pro-cess.
Thus, the choice of EDF is not unique and is strongly influenced by the de-sideratum of explanatory effectiveness as well as by the assumption made regardingthe knowledge profile of the addressee of the meaning-representation process.
Forexample, in the case of the proposition p 4 During much of the past decade Pat --- --earned far more than all of his close friends put together, the EDF might consist ---7----- ----- of the relational framesFRIEND [Namel; Name2; p], where p is the degree.to which Name1 is a friend ofName2; INCOME [Name; Income; Year], where Income is the income of Name in yearYear, counting backward from the present; MUCH [Proportion; ~1, where in is the de-gree to which a numerical value of Proportion fits the meaning of much in the con-text of p; and FAR.MORE [Numberl; Number2; P].
in which p is the degree to whichNumber1 fits the description far more in relation to NumberP.
In effect, the com-position of EDF is determined by the information that is needed for an assessmentof the compatibility of the given SE with any designated object or, more generally,a specified state of affairs in the universe of discourse.In Phase 2, a test procedure is constructed which upon application to an explan-atory database -that is, an instantiation of EDF - yields the test scores,428 L.A. ZADEHTl,...bv the3Tn, which represent the degrees to which the elastic constraints inducedconstituents of SE are satisfied.
For example, in the case of p', the testppocedure would yield the test scores for the constraints induced by close friend,@, far more, etc.
--In Phase 3, the partial test scores obtained in Phase 2 are aggregated into anoverall test score, T, which serves as a measure of the compatibility of SE withED, the explanatory database.
As was stated earlier, the components of T are num-bers in the unit interval or, more generally, possibility/probability distributionsover this interval.
In particular, when the semantic entity is a proposition, p,and the overall test score, T, is a scalar, 'I may be interpreted as the truth ofp relative to ED or, equivalently, as the possibility of ED given p. In this in-terpretation, then, the classical truth-conditional semantics may be viewed as aspecial case of test-score semantics which results when the constraints inducedby p are inelastic and the overall test score is allowed to be only pass or fail --The test procedure which yields the overall test score T is interpreted as themeaning of SE.To illustrate the phases in question, we shall consider a few simple examples(a) SE 4 Ellen resides in a'small city near Oslo.In this case, EDF is assumed to comprise the following relationalframes ( + stands for union ):EDF 4 RESIDENCE [Name; City.Name]+POPULATION [City.Name; Population]+SMALL [Population; PI+NEAR [City.Namel; City.Name2; lo]In RESIDENCE, City.Name is the name of the city in which Name resides; in POPULA-TION, Population is the number of residents in City.Name; in SMALL, P is the de-gree to which a city with a population equal to the value of Population is small;and in NEAR, P is the degree to which City.Namel is near City.NameZ.The test procedure which leads to the overall test score T -- and thus representsthe meaning of SE - is described below.
In this procedure, Steps 1 and 2 involvethe determination of the value of an attribute given the values of other attri-butes; Steps 3 and 4 involve the testing of constraints; and Step 5 involves anaggregation of the partial test scores into the overall test score T.1.

This'TEST-SCORESEMANTICSFORNATURALLANGUAGES 429mode of aggregation implies that, in SE, the denotation of conjunction is taken tobe the Cartesian product of the denotations of the conjuncts (Zadeh (1981)).
(b) SEA During much of the past decade Pat earned far more than all ofhis close friends put together.In this case, we shall employ the EDF described earlier, that is:EDF 2 INCOME[Name; Year; Amount]+FRIEND[Namel; Name2; u]+FAR.MORE[Numberl; NumberP; n]+MUCH[Proportion; u]The test procedure comprises the following steps:1.
Find the fuzzy set of Pat's friends:FP4 NamelxnFRIEND [Name2 = Pat]in which the left subscript Namelxu signifies that the relation FRIEND [NameP=Pat]is projected on the domain of the attributes Name1 and u, yielding the fuzzy set offriends of Pat.2.
Intensify FP to account for the modifier.

The assumption underlying this step is that thefuzzy set of close friends of Pat may be derived from that of friends of Pat by in-tensification.3.
