On the necessity of intentions and (at least) the usefulness of rhetoricalrelations: A position paperVibhu O. Mittal and C~cile L. ParisInh~rmation Sciences Institute and Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of Southern Calitt~rnia4676 Admiralty Way, Marina del Rey, CA 90292{mittal, paris} @isi.eduIn this position paper, we argue Ibr the need for a generation system to represent communicative goals(i.e., goals that express the speaker's intent to aflect the bearer's mental attitudes), at least if certain tasksare to be achieved.
We lurther argue that, wlfile rhetorical relations might be recoverable ttom otherIactors, they appear to be a useful level of abstraction to maintain about the discourse structure to avoidcostly reasoning.
However, we believe a source of conliasion comes Ii'om the Ihct that the term 'rhetoricalrelations' encompasses various diftbrent constraints about a discourse structure, and that there is a need tobe clear about what a 'rhetorical relation' is.1 Need for communicative goalsTypically, a speaker has some goal in mind when producing an utterance.
Tiffs can be a very concretegoal such as "describe an object", "motivate the user to perlt~rm an action", or a much vaguer one, such asdiscussing an event or simply providing information about a subject.
We believe that communicative goalsshould be represented explicitly in a generation system Ik~r several reasons:?
To select he facts to be expressed, as typically, one does not utter everything one knows, and one'scomnmnicative intentions influences trongly what is IO be said.?
To determine the ordering of lacts to be expressed, in the event hai these facts have been determinedahead of time.
Indeed, typically, several orderings will be possible, but only a subset of these will beappropriate Ik~r the speaker's intention(s).?
To handle dialogue (feedback): it has already been shown that a record of the rhetorical relationsholding in an utterance is not enough to be able to participate in a dialogue (specifically to recover fromcommunication failures) \[6\].
This is because, as there is not always a one to one relationship betweenrhetorical relations and communicative goals, communicative goals cannot always be recovered Iioma record of the rhetorical relationships and the communicative goal is necessary to handle fi~llow-upquestions.?
To take into account any non-textual phenomena: li.~r instance, there may be many ways to elaborateon a specific aspect in a presentation that includes both text and graphics: the specific manner ofelaboration will depend upon the communicative goal to be achieved (e.g., providing inli:~rmationabout the position of a knob in the control panel may result in a picture of the whole panel, whileproviding inlk~rmation i order to identity the knob may result in a descriptive phrase such as "thehexagonal knob").We thus argue that communicative goals are important to represent in a generation system and are anessential part of discourse structure (which is not to say they are suMcient, however).Some researchers have argued that colnmunicative goals are not necessary l~lr coherent text generation,and have cited architectures such as schemas and systems based on "domain knowledge" to illustrate theirpoint.
In our view, this simply illustrates how one can compile out the intentional knowledge necessary90to achieve coherent discourse within a specific domain and context, not that intentions are not an essentialpart of the discourse structure.
It is important to realize that, while Ibr some generation tasks, schemas thatcompile out intentional information are enough, systems based on such generation schemes are then unableto handle other discourse phenomena such as dialogue.Finally, some researchers have conflated the notion of communicative goals with that of rhetorical relations,arguing that it is sufficient to reason about rhetorical relations that hold between certain facts to construct acoherent text, and Ihrther arguing that the choice of a rhetorical relation indicates a specific communicativegoal.
We do not agree with these arguments, however, at least not with respect o the current heories ofrhetorical relations.
Indeed, in general, there is not a one-to-one mapping between intentions and rhetoricalrelations \[6\].
Consider lbr example the Ibllowing dialogue, taken from \[6\]:S: (1) Remove the cover.
(2) You'll need the Phillips screwdriver.
(3) It's in the top drawer ofthe toolbox.
Do you have it'?H: No.Using an RST-type analysis \[4\], (3) is a CIRCUMSTANCE to (2).
In terms of intentions, (2) is utteredin an attempt o make the hearer idenli\[y and find the screwdriver.
Suppose the hearer is not able tofind the screwdriver, because he or she cannot identit3, it.
At this point, the speaker needs to recognizethat the intention to make the hearer identiI3, the screwdriver has not been achieved.
However, thespeaker cannot recover this intention simply from knowing that there is a CIRCUMSTANCE relation between(2) and (3).
CIRCUMSTANCE could have been used to achieve a variety of other intentions.
Similarly,the communicative goal could have been achieved using other rhetorical relations uch as, Ior example,ELABORATE-0BJECT-ATTRIBUTE.
(For more details, see \[6\]).2 Rhetor i ca l  re lat ionsDoing text analysis, researchers have tbund that coherent texts tend to exlfibit patterns in their organization,with a limited set of relationships between their components.
As a result, people have attempted tocharacterized these relationships in terms of "rhetorical relations" (or schemas of rlaetorical predicates).Typically, the relationships identified above arise because of various filctors, including:?
There is a semantic relation that llolds between tile various semantic units (or sets of semantic unitstaken as a whole) - for example, given the Ihcts: <John has a black car> <John's car is a Honda>,since 'being a Honda' is an attribute of John's car, an item introduced in the first fact, we could say:"John has a black car.
It is a Honda" and draw an "elaborate-object-attribute" between the two clauses.?
Intentions also sometimes have a canonical clustering: tot example, the goal to provide evidenceIbr a claim often appears when a claim is given.
In the resulting text, the relation "evidence" can bedrawn between the two spans of text that result IYonl tile two intentional goals.?
A recognized pattern of thematic progression is present in the text, giving rise to what has been calledto a "textual relation" between units of text.Essentially, these standard patterns (or standard sets of constraints) have been given names (the namesof the "rhetorical relations", e.g., "elaboration", evidence", or "additive").
These labels seem usetul toperform certain types of reasoning on a text, such as the choice of syntactic realization (including decidingwhere a sentence break should occur, or the choice of a cue phrase), e.g., \[6,10\], without reasoning explicitlyabout the actual constraints that hold, and which the speaker wanted to lfighlighl.
(Note that this is not tosay that there is a clear unambiguous mapping between tile rhetorical relation and the resulting syntacticrealization).91For example, if a system knows that a unit of lext U 1 is in PURPOSE relation to another unit U2, thenthe realization component can select an appropriate syntax It verbalize U 1 and U2 (e.g., "in order to..."),without re-reasoning about he constraints hat hold between the inll~rmation presenled in U 1 and U2.Similarly, when several constraints hold and the speaker chooses to highlight one, tiffs can be indicated inthe discourse structure by the appropriate preferred label, which then constrains the realization componentto choose the appropriate syntactic structure allowing the hearer to recognize the prelerred interpretation.For example, consider the propositions "turn on the light" and "flip the switch" (taken lYom \[9\]).
Thesepropositions stand in several semantic relations with respect o each other: e.g., at least, CAUSE-EFFECTand PURPOSE.
Given the speaker's intention to make the hearer know how to turn the light, depending, forexample, on the focus the speaker wishes to have, several texts can be generated, each would highlight adifferent relation, and each would be analyzed with a ditl~rent RST-relation between the two clauses (e.g.,"to turn on the light, flip the switch" or "flipping the switch will cause the light to be turned on").
If thediscourse structure is annotated with the interpretation the speaker wishes to preI~r, the appropriate sentencecan be generated.If, then, when generating text, one keeps track of these rhetorical relations to indicate the reasoning thathas already taken place, the constraints that are already known to hold between various units, and whichthe speaker wishes to highlight, one avoids having to perl~rm that reasoning again, t~r example, to choosea cue phrase.
While this might not be imporlant when the relation is a simple semantic one (e.g., <x> is thecolor of <y>) as tiffs check can be done easily, it is uselul (computationally speaking) when the reasoningthat took place is complex (even on a semantic level, lot example, to ligure out that <x> is a cause of<y>, when no causal ink exists in the knowledge base).
It is also important when several relations exist,diflerent syntactic realization highlight different relations, and one was prelerred by the speaker.
In thissense, current relations can be considered as 'macros' that represent a set of constraints that hold betweenvarious units (semantic units, textual units or intentions).
As such, they might turn out to be an essentiallevel of abstraction to represent as part of a discourse structure in a generation system to control realization.In general, however, there are serious problems with current heories of rhetorical relations uch as RST.Several problems tand out:?
It is not always clear what the label actually stands lbr and what exactly it is used tbr.
The constraintsthey represent are not well defined, may even differ depending on tile surrounding context, and mayencompass several different aspects of the discourse.?
As already pointed out, these relations represent difl~rent ypes of constraints.
This has also beendiscussed by other researchers \[1-3, 5-8\].
Conllating all these faclors by using one term "rhetoricalrelations" leads to contusion.?
Few theories allow Ik~r several relations to hold at the same time.
~ Yet.
semantic onstraints, relationsbetween communicative goals and textual relations usually co-occur \[2, 7\].
In fact, not only do theyco-occur between two units of text, but they may also give rise to different non-isomorphic structures.However, all these relations (or constraints) contribute to generating an appropriate t xt and all shouldbe represented and taken into account.
Furthermore, several constraints of the same type might bepresent.?
To do an analysis in terms of rhetorical relations uch as RST, one is often implicitly also doing anintentional analysis.
For example, consider the sentence:(1) if you cook tonight, (2) I'll take you out to the movies.I Notable exceptions ale theories based on Systemics Linguistics.
e.g.. \[5\].92Based purely on semantic ground, the sentences would be analyzed as having a cond i t ion  betweentheir two clauses.
The other interpretation f MOTIVATION requires the analyzer to also do theintentional nalysis.
In truth, of course, both relations co-exist.
(This is also discussed in \[7\].
)3 ConclusionsCommunicative goals are necessary to build a generation system capable of both generating coherent dis-course and being able to respond to feedback and tbllow-up questions.
Furthermore, rhetorical relations area useful computational tool to represent constraints we currently don't otally understand, avoid duplicatingreasoning from lirst principles, and provide an appropriate l vel of interPace with the realization componentof a system.
A theory of rhetorical relations, however, is far from complete and would gain l?om identifyingmore clearly what the relations tand lbr and how they are used.References\[1\]\[2\]\[31\[4\]\[5\]\[61\[7\]\[81\[91\[101HovY, E.
