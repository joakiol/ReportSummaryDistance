TENSE, QUANTIFIERS, AND CONTEXTSErhard W. HinrichsDepartment of LinguisticsUniversity of IllinoisUrbana, IL 61801This paper describes a compositional semantics for temporal expressions as part of the meaningrepresentation language (MRL) of the JANUS system, a natural language understanding and generationsystem under joint development by BBN Labs and ISI.
The analysis is based on a higher-orderintensional logic described in detail in Hinrichs (1987a).
Temporal expressions of English are translatedinto this language as quantifiers over times that bind temporal indices on predicates.
The semanticevaluation of time-dependent predicates is defined relative to a set of discourse contexts, which,following Reichenbach (1947), include the parameters of speech time and reference time.
The resultingcontext-dependent and multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expressions olves a set of well-knownproblems that arise when traditional systems of tense logic are applied to natural language semantics.Based on the principle of rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature of the analysis provides astraightforward and well-defined interface between the parsing component and the semantic-interpre-tation component of JANUS.1 INTRODUCTIONJANUS is a natural language understanding and gener-ation system that allows the user to interface withseveral knowledge bases maintained by the U.S. Navy.The knowledge bases contain, among other things,information about he deployment schedules, locations,and readiness conditions of the ships in the PacificFleet.I.
a.
Did the admiral deploy the ship?b.
List all ships as of 4-1-86.c.
Which C3 ships are now C4?d.
When will Vincent arrive in Hawaii?e.
Who was Frederick's previous commander?f.
Every admiral has to deploy a ship today.As the sample queries in (1) demonstrate, much of thisinformation is highly time-dependent: ships change lo-cations in accordance with their deployment schedules.They can incur equipment failures or undergo personnelchanges.
Such events, in turn, can affect the ships'readiness ratings, which are expressed by codes such asC3 or C4.
Much of the information that the JANUS useris trying to access is time-dependent i  that an appro-priate answer can be given only if the time of the queryand/or the time of the events in question are taken intoaccount.
It is, therefore, imperative that at the level ofsemantic representation f the natural language input anadequate analysis can be provided for those linguisticexpressions that carry time information: for example,tenses, temporal adverbials, and temporal adjectives.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: InSection 2, I will sketch the basic ideas of the frameworkof logical semantics, or more specifically, of MontagueGrammar, the framework that I will use for my analysis.Section 2 also gives a brief overview of the conceptualmodularity of the JANUS system, which demonstrateshow Montague Grammar as a linguistic theory can beapplied in natural-language processing research.
In sec-tions 3-8, I will address the subject matter of temporalsemantics itself.
My own analysis of temporal semanticsis very much a response to the kinds of analyses thathave been provided in classical tense logic.
Section 3,therefore, provides a brief overview of analyses of thelatter type.
In Section 4, I will review some well-knownproblems that arise when one applies classical tenselogics to the semantics of natural language.
In Section 5,I will show how a logic with multiple indices that isbased on Reichenbach's analysis of English tense canovercome most of the problems that standard tenselogic cannot.
While this richer logic will solve most ofour problems, the issue of tense and noun-phrase (NP)Copyright 1988 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Section 6 will show how giving narrow scopeto tense quantifiers enables us to provide adequatescope relations with respect o NP quantifiers.
In addi-tion, I will show how a contextual nalysis of nouns andnoun phrases lets us account for the kind of temporalphenomena that were first discussed in Enc 1981, 1986.In Section 7, I argue that the context-dependent featureof the analysis does not add extra complexity to mytreatment of time-dependent expressions, but is neededfor purposes of discourse understanding in general.Finally, I will demonstrate in Section 8 how the narrowscope of tense also leads to a compositional syntax andsemantics of tensed sentences in English.2 THE SEMANTIC FRAMEWORKThe semantic theory that I have adopted in my research?
is that of truth-conditional semantics.
More specifically,I have adopted the framework of Montague Grammar, aversion of truth-conditional semantics that has beendeveloped by the logician Richard Montague (cf.
Mon-tague 1973).1 Montague Grammar shares the fundamen-tal assumption of all truth-conditional theories of mean-ing, namely that natural language semantics has torelate in a systematic fashion linguistic expressions suchas words, phrases, and sentences to nonlinguistic, real-world objects, events, and states of affairs.
In particu-lar, a semantic theory has to provide a rigorous defini-tion of the truth conditions for the sentences of alanguage.
The emphasis in Montague Grammar lies onthe descriptive aspect of language use.
Sentences aysomething true or false about the world.
For a speakerto know the meaning of a sentence amounts to knowingwhat state of affairs has to obtain in the world, in orderfor the sentence to be true.In a Montague Grammar the meanings of sentences,phrases, and words are interpreted relative to a modelthat assigns meanings of the appropriate type to suchlinguistic entities.
In his papers Montague developsvarious instantiations of his theory.
The one that is mostcommonly used by linguists is the one that Montague(1973) uses in his paper "The Proper Treatment ofQuantification i Ordinary English" (commonly abbre-viated as PTQ).
In that paper Montague associatesmeanings with linguistic expressions in an indirect fash-ion.
As shown in Figure 1, syntactic expressions ofEnglish are first translated into a language of higher-order intensional logic, which in turn is interpretedmodel-theoretically.
This indirect method of semanticinterpretation beys Frege's Principle of Composition-ality, which says that the meaning of a complex phraseis a function of two things: (1) the meanings of itsconstituent parts, and (2) the way in which these partsare syntactically combined.
Formally speaking, themeaning of a complex expression is the homomorphicimage of its syntactic omposition.

Montague Grammar--Syntax nd Semantics.terms, a translation procedure from English into inten-sional logic that is based on Frege's Principle has tospecify two things: (1) for each lexical item, the proce-dure has to specify a translation into the appropriatetype of the logic, and (2) for each syntactic rule, theprocedure has to specify how the translations of theinput constituents combine in the translation for theoutput constituent of the syntactic rule.Montague Grammar provides a simple and elegantinterface between the syntactic and semantic ompo-nents of a grammar.
Since each syntactic operation ismirrored by a semantic operation, semantic interpreta-tion is in a sense syntax-driven.
Moreover, syntacticanalysis and semantic interpretation can proceed inparaHeh while a sentence or phrase is being parsed inaccordance with the syntactic rules, its logical form canbe computed by the translation rules.
This inherentparallelism is one of the features that makes MontagueGrammar an attractive theory for natural languageprocessing.
Everything else being equal, a system inwhich syntax and semantics can operate in parallel iscomputationally more efficient han one in which theyhave to operate sequentially.Another attractive feature is the strict modularitybetween syntax and semantics.
Modularity is not onlygood practice in software ngineering, it is particularlyimportant in building natural language interfaces.
If onewants to extend the coverage of the grammar of a givensystem, one wants to do so in an incremental fashionand without having to modify the control structurebetween major components.
Montague Grammar allowsone to upscale a system in this way: in order to extendthe coverage of the grammar, one simply writes addi-tional syntactic rules and translation rules that cover thenew data.Apart from these methodological considerations, itturns out that the same three components (syntax,translation, and model-theoretic interpretation) that areof importance in Montague's theory form an integralpart in the functional components of natural anguageinterface systems uch as JANUS.

Components of JANUS.the English input is fed into the syntactic parser ofJANUS, which yields as output a parse tree, which inturn forms the input to the translation component.
Thetranslation component generates ome logical expres-sion that represents the meaning of the English input.This logical expression is then evaluated with respect tothe database, which one can take to be a proxy for apartial model of the real world, in the case of JANUS amodel of the objects and states of affairs pertaining tothe Pacific Fleet.The translation component of JANUS is somewhatmore elaborate than the one Montague 1973 formulates.At the first level of translation, every lexical item ofEnglish is translated into some logical expression of anEnglish-oriented formal language called EFL.
At theEFL level, no attention is given to the context that maycontribute to the interpretation of the English input.Neither is any attempt made at the EFL level todisambiguate l xical meanings.
Lexical disambiguationis provided by a domain model, which, among otherthings, captures all the information about lexical mean-ings known to the system)Apart from domain knowledge, the system keepstrack of those aspects of a user's question-answersession that are relevant for determining the referenceof context-dependent queries such as (2).2. a.
Question: Where were the carriers yesterday?b.
Answer: In the Indian Ocean.c.
Question: How long have they been there?The discourse model contains parameters such as thetime at which the question-answer session is takingplace.
This parameter is necessary to calculate thereferent of deictic time adverbials uch as yesterday in(2a).
In addition, the discourse model keeps track oflocations such as the Indian Ocean and referents ofnoun phrases uch as the carriers in order to interpretlocational adverbs such as there and anaphoric pro-nouns such as they in (2c).Input from the domain model and the discoursemodel leads to translation to a world-model  language(WML), which in turn is translated into expressions ofthe query language of the appropriate knowledge base:a database IDB, an expert system FRESH, or a displayknowledge base OSGP.
In this paper I will for the mostpart concentrate on the level of syntax to EFL transla-tion, although the context-dependent aspects of mytreatment of temporal semantics will lead to somediscussion of the discourse model of JANUS in sections6 and 7 below.3 APPLYING CLASSICAL TENSE LOGIC TO NATURALLANGUAGE SEMANTICSWith this much of an introduction, let me now turn tothe topic of temporal semantics itself.
My own analysisis very much a response to the kinds of analyses thathave been provided in classical tense logic.
When I referto classical tense logic, I mean the kinds of logics thatoriginate in the work of the logician Arthur Prior (cf.Prior 1967) and that have subsequently been applied tonatural language semantics (cf.
Montague 1973 andMort 1973).In classical tense logic time-dependency of informa-tion enters into the definition of the notion of a propo-sition.
Propositions are defined as functions from a setof times (TI) to the set of truth values (T- -"true")  and(F---"false").
Declarative sentences of natural languageare taken to express propositions.
The sentence It israining can be taken to be that proposition that yieldsthe value true for those times at which it is raining, andfalse for those at which it is not.Tense operators can be defined in such a logic as in(3) and (4).
Formula 3 defines a past operator P, which,applied to a proposition p, yields the value true for sometime t ifp is true at some time t' prior to t. Likewise, (4)defines a Y operator, where Y is mnemonic for yester-day, with the expected truth conditions: Yp is true at tif p is true at some time t' that falls within the day priorto the day in which t falls.3.
\[P P\]t = T i f f  \ [P \ ] t ' -  T for some time t' < t.4.
\[Y P i t  = T i f f  \ [P \ ] t '  ---- T for some timet' C_ \[DAY (t) - 1\].All of this sounds rather plausible.
However, it turnsout that if one tries to apply tense operators uch as Pand Y in natural-language s mantics, a set of well-known problems arises.
4Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 5Erhard W. Hinrichs Tense, Quantifiers, and Contexts4.
INADEQUACIES OF CLASSICAL TENSE LOGIC4.1 INTERACTION OF TENSE AND TIME ADVERBIALSThe first such problem, which I pointed out in Hinrichs1981 and which was independently noted in Dowty1982, concerns the interaction between tense and timeadverbials.
If for Sentence 5, one interprets the pasttense in (5) by the P operator and the adverbial yester-day by the Y operator, then one of the two operatorshas to have scope over the other.5.
Vincent left yesterday.6.
P \[ Y \[ leave' (Vincent') \] \]7.
Y \[ P \[ leave' (Vincent') \] \]However,  neither the formula in (6), nor the one in (7)gives adequate truth conditions for (5).
The truth con-ditions imposed by (6) are inadequate, since the sen-tence in (5) would, for example, count as true whenuttered on January 15, 1988, if the ship Vincent left noton January 14, 1988, but instead on May 23, 1986.
Thisis because the P operator can shift the temporal evalu-ation of the proposition Y \[leave' (Vincent')\] from thespeech time to any past time (t"), for example to sometime (t") on May 24, 1986.
In this case the Y operatorwill, in turn, shift evaluation to t' within the day prior tot", i.e., to some time on May 23, 1986.
Hence theproposition leave' (Vincent') will be evaluated withrespect to that day, instead of the day prior to thespeech time.Formula 7 can assign wrong truth conditions as well.Here the Y operator shifts evaluation to some timewithin the day prior to the speech time.
But the Poperator, in turn, shifts evaluation to some time prior tothat, but necessarily not within the same day.4.2 INTERACTION OF TENSE AND NEGATIONSimilar problems arise when one uses standard tenselogic for sentences in which tense interacts with sen-tence negation as in (8).
As was first pointed out inPartee 1973, one can assign the past-tense operator (P)either narrow scope with respect o negation as in (9), orwide scope as in (10).8.
Vincent did not leave.9.
--1 \[ P \[ leave' (Vincent') \]\]10.
P \[ --1 \[ leave' (Vincent') \]\]However,  neither the formula in (9), nor the one in (10)assigns adequate truth conditions to (8).
Formula 9 saysthat there exists no time in the past at which theproposition is true, clearly not capturing the meaning of(8).
Formula 10 makes (8) true if at any time in the pastVincent did not leave.
Given that ships participate inevents other than arrivals at some point during theirexistence, (10) will be trivially satisfied, but does notcapture adequately the truth conditions of (8).4.3 TENSE AND QUANTIFIED NOUN PHRASESThe third type of inadequacy of standard tense logic hasto do with the interaction of tense and quantified NPsand was first pointed out in Enc 1981, 1986.
Enc pointsout that Priorean tense operators fail to capture certainreadings of sentences uch as (11).1 I.
Every admiral was (once) a cadet.12.
V x \[ admiral' (x) --> P \[ cadet' (x) \]\]13.
P \[ V x \[ admiral' (x) --> cadet' (x) \]\]Since P is a propositional operator, it can take scopeover the consequent of the material implication in (12).Formula 12 represents the reading that everyone who isan admiral now was a cadet at some time in the past.The second reading in (13), where P has scope over theentire formula, assigns the somewhat absurd truth con-ditions that at some time in the past every admiral wassimultaneously a cadet.
However,  as Enc observescorrectly, with propositional tense operators we cannotobtain the perfectly natural reading that everyone whois an admiral now or who was an admiral at some timein the past was a cadet at some time prior to being anadmiral.4.4 TEMPORAL ANAPHORAThere is a fourth problem that arises when one usestense operators of standard tense logic for the semanticinterpretation of pieces of discourse or of single sen-tences that describe multiple events.14.
Vincent was hit by a harpoon, was abandoned byits crew, and sank.The most natural interpretation of (14) is one in whichthe events are understood to have happened in the sametemporal order as they are sequenced in the sentence.However, if one uses a Priorean P operator to interpreteach occurrence of the past tense in (14), one arrives atan interpretation, which incorrectly allows for anytemporal ordering.5 A TENSE LOGIC WITH MULTIPLE INDICESIt turns out that most of the problems that we have justdiscussed can be solved if one recognizes more than oneparameter of temporal evaluation.
In the models givento tense logics such as the ones first developed by Prior,one standardly evaluates propositions with respect o asingle time that we may call the event time, the time atwhich an event happens or at which a state of affairsobtains.
The point of speech is taken to be a special caseof this parameter.An alternative to models with only one temporalparameter was given in Reichenbach 1947.
Reichenbachargues for distinguishing between three parameters,which he calls speech time, event time, and referencetime.
The meaning of the first two parameters should beself-explanatory.
It is the third parameter, reference6 Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988Erhard W. Hinrichs Tense, Quantifiers, and Contextstime, that requires explanation.
Reichenbach conceivesof reference time as the temporal perspective fromwhich an event is viewed, as opposed to the event ime,the time at which the event occurs.
Reference time canbe either implicit in the discourse context or explicitlyspecified by temporal adverbials such as yesterday.
Foreach individual tense, reference time is temporallyordered with respect to the other two parameters.Reference time plays a crucial role in Reichenbach'saccount of the distinction between the simple past andthe present perfect in English.
In both cases event imeprecedes peech time.
But while for the simple past, theevent ime is viewed from a perspective in the past, theevent is viewed from the perspective of the present inthe case of the present perfect.As first shown in Aqvist 1976 and Guenthner 1979,Reichenbach's analysis can be formalized in a tenselogic in which tense operators are evaluated with re-spect to multiple indices.
For example, a Reichen-bachean past operator (P) can be defined as in (15).15.
\[P P\]ts,tr,te -- T iff \[P\]ts,tr,t' for some time t' suchthat t' < ts and t' C_ tr.The parameters ofevaluation i (15), ts, tr, and te, standfor speech time, reference time, and event ime, respec-tively.
The operator P shifts evaluation of the event imete to some time (t') in the past such that t' falls withinsome reference time tr.
Note that contrary to Reichen-bach's original account of the past tense, the parametersof reference time and speech time are not directlyordered in (15), but only indirectly by virtue of thetemporal ordering between event ime t' and the speechtime ts.
This weaker ordering between tr and ts ismotivated by sentences uch as (16), in which thereference time denoted by the adverbial today containsthe speech time ts.16.
Vincent arrived today.In the intended models of interpretation for the Poperator in (15), times are taken to be time intervals.Since (15) requires that the event ime t' be located priorto ts and be contained in tr, (15) imposes as a restrictionon tr that a subinterval of tr be ordered prior to ts.
Inorder for (16) to be true, the subinterval of tr that lies inthe past has to be a proper subinterval of tr, whereas for(17) all of tr has to precede ts.17.
Vincent left yesterday.Given Reichenbach's parameters, the definition of theY operator, given earlier in (5), can be modified as in(18).18.
\ [Y P\]ts,tr.te = Ti f f  \[P\]ts,DAY(ts)-l,te = T.Unlike the P operator in (15), Y in (18) does not shift te;instead, it Operates on tr and shifts that parameter today prior to ts.With the redefined operators P and Y, one can nowgive adequate truth conditions for sentences involvingtense and time adverbials.
The logical form for (17), forexample, can be evaluated as in (19): Y specifies thereference time to be the day prior to the speech time,and the P operator, in turn, correctly locates the eventtime as being within that reference time.19.
\[Y \[ P \[ leave' (Vincent') \] \] \ ] t s , t r , te  = Ti f f\[ P \[leave' (Vincent') \ ] t s , \ [DAY( ts ) - l \ ] , t  = Ti f f\[ leave' (Vincent') \ ] t s , \ [DAY( ts ) - l \ ] , t '  = Tfor some t' < t and t' C_ \[DAY (ts)-l\].The P and Y operators, defined in (15) and (18) above,differ from the operators found in Aqvist, Guenthner,and Dowty in that in my analysis all three of Reichen-bach's parameters are taken to be separate for purposesof evaluation, while Aqvist, Guenthner, and Dowtydefine operators that are evaluated with respect o twoparameters only.
This is because Dowty considers thespeech time as a special case of the reference time,while Aqvist and Guenthner consider speech time to bea special case of the event ime.As I have argued elsewhere (cf.
Hinrichs 1981, 1986)and as was noted independently in Dowty 1982, theneed for tense operators with three separate parametersarises in the context of sentences such as (20).20= Vincent rescued a ship yesterday which is now inHawaii.As first noted in Kamp 1971, the interpretation f nowrequires that the speech point of the utterance becarried along at every stage of evaluating sentencessuch as (20), whose logical form can be represented asin (21).21.
Y \[P \[::Ix \[ship' (x) & rescue' (Vincent', x) & NOW\[be-in' (x,Hawaii')\]\]\]\]In the evaluation of (21), the Y operator, as defined in(18), fixes the reference time as the day prior to ts, whilethe P operator from (15) shifts the event time to sometime within that reference time.
NOW, the third tempo-ral operator in (21), appears in the scope of the Y andthe P operator.
NOW, which can be defined as in (22),can be interpreted correctly in the context of (20), onlyif the speech time is kept as a separate index and heldconstant even though reference time and event timehave been changed by the P and Y operators.22.
\[NOW P\]ts,tr,te = Ti f f  \[P\]ts,tr',te = T for ts C_ tr'.Using temporal operators with multiple indices of eval-uation, one can also account correctly for the interac-tion of tenses and negation.
In the evaluation of (23)shown in (24), the past operator locates the event imet' prior to speech time and within some reference timetr, which in the case of (23) has to be taken to becontextually specified.23.
Vincent did not leave.24.
\[ 7 \[ P \[ leave' (Vincent') \ ] \ ] \ ] t s , t r , te  = T iff\[ P \[ leave' (Vincent') \ ] \ ] t s , t r .

Hinrichs Tense, Quantifiers, and Contexts\[leave' (Vincent') \]ts,tr,t' = F for all times t'such that t' < ts and t' _C tr.Sentence 23 is true according to Formula 24 if there isno time within tr at which the untensed propositionleave' (Vincent') is true.It turns out that a multi-indexed tense logic providesthe basis for an adequate account of tense in discourse.By associating event times with respect o temporallyordered reference times, as sketched in (26), one canindirectly induce an ordering among the events them-selves.
Moreover, by updating such reference timesafter each event description, one can order multipleevents as described in (25) in the appropriate way.
Therelations < and C_ in (26) are meant o stand for temporalprecedence and temporal inclusion, respectively.25.
Vincent \[was hit by a harpoon\]e~, \[wasabandoned by its crew\]e2, and \[sank\]~3.26.
trl < tr2 < tr3Ul Ul Ultel te2 te3In order to induce the correct emporal orderings amongevents and states of affairs in a given discourse, refer-ence times have to be updated appropriately duringdiscourse processing.
Formula 26 shows the simplestcase of such updating.
A new reference time is intro-duced after processing each event so that the temporalorder of the events becomes isomorphic to the order inwhich the events are introduced.
However,  for morecomplicated pieces of discourse the conditions underwhich new reference times are introduced can be farmore complex.
The aspectual properties of the events inquestion, event-subevent relations, causal connectionsobtaining among events and states of affairs, as well asthe overall structure of the discourse itself are amongthe conditioning factors.
It will not be possible to give adetailed account of these issues here; for a more thor-ough discussion of how to interpret emporal structuresin discourse on the basis of a multi-indexed tense logic,I refer the reader to Hinrichs 1981, 1986 and Partee1984.Let us consider next two alternative logical represen-tations for Sentence 27 in such a multi-indexed logic.27.
Vincent left yesterday.28.
\[Y \[ P \[ leave' (Vincent') \] \] \]ts,tr,te29.
3 t ' \ [ t '  <ts&t r  = \ [DAY( ts ) -  1 \]& t' C_ tr & leave' (Vincent') (t') \]The formula in (28) we have already discussed.
In (28)past tense is translated into a propositional operatorwhose semantics is implicit in the truth conditionsimposed with respect o the model-theory.
In (29) thepast tense leads to existential quantification over times.The existential quantifier binds variables which appearas extra argument positions on predicates.
Thus, leave',which is ordinarily a one-place predicate, turns into atwo-place predicate that takes individuals and times asits arguments.
The variables ts and tr occur as freevariables in (29) and, as stated earlier, stand for theReichenbachean speech time and reference time, re-spectively.Although the two formulas in (28) and (29) arelogically equivalent in the sense that both are true underthe same set of models, I will adopt the style of logicalrepresentation i  (29) for the remainder of this paper.This is because in the context of the JANUS system itis important o explicitly quantify over times, since inthe database times are explicitly entered as dates, timestamps, etc.
In order to be able to access them, it isimportant o incorporate time information explicitly atthe level of logical form.A second reason for preferring the style of represen-tation in (29) over the one in (28) concerns the interac-tion between tenses and quantified NPs.
Since formulassuch as (29) explicitly quantify over times, scope rela-tions with respect to quantification over individualsbecome completely transparent.6 TENSE AND QUANTIFIED NOUN PHRASESUsing the style of representation exemplified by for-mula (29), let me then return to the issue of tense andquantification, which is still unresolved.
Consider onceagain the types of examples that, as Enc points out,cannot be handled in a tense logic that gives temporaloperators cope over entire propositions.30.
Every admiral graduated from Annapolis.31.
V x \[admiral' (x) --~ P \[graduate-from'(x,Annapolis')\]\]32.
P \[Vx \[admiral' (x) ~ graduate-from'(x,Annapolis')\]\]If tense operators uch as P have propositional scope, Pcan either scope over an entire formula, as in (32), orover the consequent of the material implication, as in(31).
Now, as we saw earlier, neither formula capturesthe reading that all present or past admirals graduatedfrom the Naval Academy in Annapolis prior to theirbeing admirals.Enc 1981 provides an interesting solution to theproblem posed by examples uch as (30).
Her solution isbased on two assumptions: 1.
Semantically, tensesshould have scope only over verb meanings, but notover any larger elements in a sentence, and 2. verbmeanings as well as noun meanings are indexical in thesense that their interpretations depend on the context ofthe utterance in the same way that demonstrative pro-nouns such as that and anaphoric pronouns uch as sheand they do.As shown in Formula 33, which represents the trans-lation for (30) in my analysis, I adopt Enc's first8 Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988Erhard W. Hinrichs Tense, Quantifiers, and Contextsassumption and assign tense scope only over the mainverb of the sentence.33.
V x \[3t \[ admiral' (x) (t) & R (x) (t) \]3 t ' \ [ t '<ts&t 'C_ t r&graduate-from' (Annapolis') (x) (t')\]\]In accordance with the Reichenbachean analysis oftense outlined in the previous section, the past tense ofsentence (30) contributes to (33) the existential quanti-fication over times t' that precede the speech point tsand are contained in some contextually specified refer-ence time tr.
Following Enc, tense is thus given scopeonly over the predicate that corresponds to the mainverb.
However,  I do not follow Enc in her secondassumption, namely, her treatment of nouns and verbsas indexicals.
It is characteristic of true indexicals uchas I, there, or you that their denotation is completelydetermined by a certain aspect of the context of theutterance.
I refers to the speaker, you to the address-ee(s), there to some contextually salient location, etc.
Incontrast o such indexical expressions, the (temporal)evaluation of nouns and verbs does not always dependon a single contextual parameter.
In the case of complexnouns such as former admiral, last readiness rating, orprevious nautical position, temporal evaluation has tobe shifted twice: first from the speech point to somecontextually salient reference point and then in turn tosome second time relative to which the nouns admiral,readiness rating, and nautical positions themselves areevaluated.
In order to accommodate complex temporalevaluations of nouns and verbs, their correspondingpredicates in logical form, such as admiral' and gradu-ate-from' in (36), carry a time-denoting argument posi-tion as part of their function-argument structure.
Sincethe temporal evaluation of such predicates can beshifted freely, their interpretation differs crucially fromthat of true indexicals whose interpretation can becompletely determined with respect o a single contex-tual parameter.Even though I do not follow Enc in treating nounsand verbs as indexical expressions, I do recognize thatthe interpretation of noun phrases uch as every admiralin (30) is in part dependent on the context in which thesentence is used.
Speakers asserting (30) are not likelyto make the claim that every admiral who ever served inthe navy of any country that has naval forces graduatedfrom the Naval Academy in Annapolis.
Typically, (30)will be used to make a claim about a much restricted setof admirals, say all the admirals in the U.S. Navy or alladmirals in the Pacific Fleet.
Exactly which set ofadmirals a speaker focuses on will depend on thediscourse context in which the sentence is used.
Thisphenomenon of restricted quantification of nounphrases is certainly not restricted to the interpretationof every admiral in (30), but applies to quantified nounphrases in general, as Stalnaker (1973), who cites ex-amples such as (34), was among the first to point out.34.
Everyone is having a good time.In (34) the interpretation of everyone typically does notinvolve the set of all individuals currently alive, butrather the set of all individuals in a given context; forexample, everyone at a certain party, at a certainlocation, and at a given time.In order to accommodate this contextual aspect ofthe interpretation of noun phrases in my analysis, Iintroduce into the translation of quantified NPs a pred-icate (R), which is meant to range over properties thatare salient in a given context and which serve to narrowdown the reference of the noun phrase in question.
Letme illustrate the context-dependent valuation of quan-tified NPs by once again focusing on Sentence 30 and itstranslation in (33).30.
Every admiral graduated from Annapolis.33.
V x \[3t \[ admiral' (x) (t) & R (x) (t) \]3 t '  \ [ t '  < ts & t' C_tr&graduate-from' (Annapolis') (x) (t')\]\]Imagine that (30) is uttered in a context in which allcurrent admirals in the Pacific Fleet are under discus-sion.
In that context, R could be instantiated as in (35),i.e., as the intension of the set of individuals (x) who arein the Pacific Fleet at a time which equals the speechtime ts.35.
A t A y \[be-in' (Pac-Fleet') (y) (t) & t = ts\]Substituting (35) for R in (33), we arrive at the formulain (36).36.
~' x \[3t \[admiral' (x) (t) & be-in' (Pac-Fleet') (x) (t)&t  = ts \] ---~ \[3 t' \ [ t '  < ts&t '  C_ t r&graduate-from' (Annapolis') (x) (t') \]\]In a context in which all present or past admirals in thePacific Fleet are under discussion, a reading that, as wepointed out in Section 4.3, one cannot capture usingPriorean tense operators, we can capture by instantiat-ing R as in (37), where -< stands for the relationtemporally preceding or equal to.37.
A t A y \[be-in' (Pac-Fleet') (y) (t) & t -< ts \]Notice that the contextual variable R serves doubleduty in my analysis.
This double role derives from thefact that R is a two-place predicate with individuals andtime intervals as its two arguments.
The argumentranging over individuals serves to restrict the denota-tion of the noun that R is associated with; for example,it restricts the denotation of admiral in (33).
The argu-ment of R that ranges over time intervals, on the otherhand, serves to restrict the time interval at which theassociated noun denotation is evaluated; for example, ifR is instantiated by (35) or (37), temporal evaluation ofthe associated predicate admiral in (33) is restricted tothe speech point or to time intervals prior to or includingthe speech point.Temporal evaluation of the verbal predicates i , thus,Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 9Erhard W. Hinrichs Tense, Quantifiers, and Contextskept separate from the temporal evaluation of predi-cates corresponding to other constituents in the sen-tence.
As first pointed out by Enc, this strategy makesit possible to account for sentences uch as 1138) and(39), whose translations require that the predicatessecretary and fugitive be evaluated relative to a timethat is distinct from the evaluation time of the predicatecorresponding to the verb.
s38.
Oliver North's secretary testified before the com-mittee.39.
Every fugitive is now in jail.In contrast to an analysis that interprets the past tensein terms of a Priorean P operator, the narrow-scopeanalysis of tense also avoids the dilemma of inducing asimultaneity reading for Sentence 30, if P has scopeover the entire formula, as in the Translation 40 of (30).30.
Every admiral graduated from Annapolis.40.
P \[ V x \[ admiral' (x)graduate-from' (Annapolis') (x)\]\]The reading in (40) is factually implausible for tworeasons: I.
It imposes imultaneity as part of the truthconditions and requires that all admirals graduated atthe same time, and 2. since the P operator forcestemporal evaluation of all predicates in its scope at thesame index, in the case of (40) it requires that everyadmiral graduated from Annapolis as an admiral, andnot, as is actually the case, subsequent to graduationfrom the Naval Academy.Notice that the formula in (33), which represents hetranslation of (30) in my analysis, avoids both problemsassociated with (40).33.
V x \[ 3 t \[ admiral' (x) (t) & R (x) (t) \]--~3t '  \ [ t '  < ts & t' C_tr&graduate-from' (Annapolis') (x) (t') \]\]Since temporal evaluation of the predicates admiral'and graduate-from' are kept separate, the first problemdoes not arise.
Since the predicates are existentiallyquantified over independently, (33), in contrast to (40),also avoids having to assign a simultaneity reading to(30).As I have outlined in this section, my treatment oftense and quantification is based on two basic assump-tions: 1.
Verbal predicates and nominal predicates bothhave an argument position that ranges over time inter-vals; however, evaluations of verbal and nominal pred-icates are independent of one another.
The evaluation ofverbal predicates is governed by quantification overtime intervals that involve Reichenbach's parameters ofspeech time, event time, and reference time.
2.
Thedenotation of quantified NPs is restricted by the predi-cate R, which ranges over properties that are salient inthe context of utterance.
In conjunction with the nar-row-scope analysis of tense, it is this context dependentfeature of my analysis that makes it more flexible thana wide-scope analysis of tense.One of the counterarguments that one may raiseagainst this context-dependent aspect of my analysis oftemporal semantics concerns the fact that tracking thesalience of objects and their properties in natural-language discourse is a notoriously difficult problem.However, I will argue in the next section that whatevermechanisms are needed to track saliency, such mecha-nisms are independently motivated by semantic andpragmatic phenomena that go beyond the phenomenonof temporal interpretation.7 EVALUATING TIME-DEPENDENT PREDICATES INCONTEXTObjects and certain of their properties can receive ormaintain salience in a discourse in any number of ways.The notions of focus (Sidner 1983), of common ground(Stalnaker 1973), and of mutual knowledge (Clark andMarshall 1981) are certainly cases in point.
In thissection I will concentrate on two such mechanisms thatplay a role in the context-dependent interpretation oftime-dependent predicates.
In each case I will arguethat the mechanism is needed for purposes other thantemporal interpretation and, therefore, does not addcomplexity to my analysis of temporal semantics.The first such mechanism concerns the way in whichobjects and their properties can become salient in thediscourse context by virtue of the goals that the dis-course participants are trying to accomplish over thecourse of a given interaction.
Consider a user of theJANUS system whose goal it is to deploy a set of ships.As part of achieving this goal, the user interacts withJANUS by asserting (41a) and then by querying (41b),whose translation is given by the formula in (42).41. a. I need to deploy a ship immediately for a search-and-rescue mission.b.
Which ships are in the Indian Ocean?42.
QUERY \[ ^ Ax \[ x ~ POW \[ A y 3 t' \[ ship' (y) (t')&R(y) ( t ' ) \ ] \ ]&3t \ [ t  = ts&tCt r&in' (Indian-Ocean') (x) (t) \]\]\]Following Scha 1983, I base the semantics of questionson speech-act operators, such as QUERY, which takethe intensional meaning of the question as an argument.The " symbol in (42) stands for the intension operator asdefined in Montague 1973.
POW stands for the power-set operation, which I use for the interpretation f pluralnouns.
6 POW in (42) is used to form the set of thoseobjects that at some time t have the property of being aship.
7 For the technical details concerning the seman-tics of the QUERY operator I refer the reader to Scha1983.
For the purposes of this paper, it should sufficethat QUERY has the effect of consulting the underlyingknowledge bases of the system as to which members ofthe power set of ships, if any, have the property of beingin the Indian Ocean at the time of the query.10 Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988Erhard W. Hinrichs Tense, Quantifiers, and ContextsThe point that I want to concentrate on with respectto the formula in (42) concerns the instantiation of thecontext-dependent predicate (R) that is associated withthe translation of the noun phrase which ships.
Giventhat the system recognizes the user's goal to be that ofimmediate ship deployment for a search-and-rescuemission, ships with a current readiness rating of C3 orbetter are salient in the context, since only such shipsare deployable.
By instantiating R appropriately, theformula in (42) turns into (43).43.
QUERY \[ ^  A x \[x ~ POW \[h y 3 t' \[ ship' (y) (t')& readiness-rating' (y) (t') >- C3 & t' = ts\]\] &3 t \[t = ts & t C_ tr & in' (Indian-Ocean') (x) (t)\]\]\]The instantiation of R in (42) follows from recognizingthe user's plan as that of immediate ship deployment.The importance of plan recognition for designing ques-tion-answering systems that generate cooperative re-sponses was emphasized in Allen/Perrault 1980, Allen1983, and Pollack 1986.
In the context of Example 41, ifit turned out that two ships, Frederick and Vincent, arein the Indian Ocean, but both ships are rated C4, then acooperative response would be (44), instead of merelylisting the ship names.41.
a. I need to deploy a ship immediately for a search-and-rescue mission.b.
Which ships are in the Indian Ocean?44.
Frederick and Vincent, but they are rated C4 andcannot be deployed.Recognizing the user's intention, which in the givencontext leads to the recognition of the current readinessrating of ships as a salient property, will make such aresponse possible.
It, therefore, turns out that trackingproperties that are salient in context is needed not onlyfor evaluating predicates in the approach to temporalsemantics that I have developed in this paper, butconstitutes a task that is independently needed for thepurposes of generating cooperative responses in ques-tion-answering.The issue of plan recognition in discourse demon-strates that objects and their properties can becomesalient implicitly in discourse, that is, without explicitlinguistic reference.
However, salience of objects andproperties can, of course, also be achieved at any pointwithin a discourse by virtue of the previous linguisticcontext.
Consider a sequence of user-system interac-tions as in (45).45. a. Query: Did every admiral deploy a ship yester-day?b.
Answer: Yes.c.
Query: Which ships will arrive in Hawaii?The person who asks the follow-up query (45c) to thesystem's affirmative answer to the initial query (45a) isnot interested in being informed about all ships that atsome time in the future will arrive in Hawaii.
Instead,the user is interested in a much more restricted set ofships that will arrive there, namely, the ones that weredeployed by some admiral the day before.
The nounship in the final query in (45) has to be interpretedrelative to the discourse context, and the temporalevaluation of the predicate is determined with respect tothat context, rather by the tense of the sentence, in thiscase, the future.
It turns out that a detailed proposal forhow to construct such a mechanism does, in fact,already exist in the literature.
Webber (1978, 1983) inher work on the interpretation f pronouns in discourse,has developed a framework that constructs during theinterpretation f a discourse acontext hat consists of aset of what she calls discourse ntities.
These discourseentities then become available as objects that pronounscan refer to.
One of the examples that Webber discussesis the interpretation f the pronoun they in (47) in thecontext of sentence (46).46.
Every admiral deployed a ship yesterday.47.
They arrived.Clearly, they refers to the set of ships deployed by someadmiral} In order to derive the appropriate discourseentity for the interpretation of they, Webber suggeststhe rule schema such as (48).
Formula 48, which is aslightly simplified version of Webber's original ruleschema, says that for any formula that meets thestructural description (SD), a discourse ntity identifiedby the ID formula is to be constructed.48.

In a context inwhich activities within the Pacific Fleet on the day priorto the speech time are at issue, R1 and R2 in (50) will beinstantiated in such a way that the denotations of ship'and admiral' are restricted to ships and admirals fromthat particular fleet.
Formula 51, the output of RuleComputational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 11Erhard W. Hinrichs Tense, Quantifiers, and ContextsSchema 48 applied to (50), further estricts which shipsare salient, namely, the set of ships contextually spec-ified by R1, which, in addition, were deployed on theprevious day by one of the admirals in question.
Thediscourse ntity with the description, in turn, becomesavailable for the interpretation f the pronoun they in afollow-up sentence such as (47).It turns out that the method of constructing discourseentities is not only relevant o the interpretation ofpronouns, but also to the contextual interpretation ofnouns and noun phrases that I am concerned with here.In particular, the discourse ntity with the description i(51) can serve not only for interpreting pronouns, butalso for instantiating R for the interpretation f the nounship in (45c) in the context of (45a).
945. a. Query: Did every admiral deploy a ship yester-day?b.
Answer: Yes.c.
Query: Which ships will arrive in Hawaii?Since the discourse ntity in (51), which ranges over aset of ships, is described in terms of the property ofhaving been deployed by some admiral the day prior tothe day of the speech point, that property can be takento be salient in the discourse context.
If one substitutesR in Translation 52 of (45c) by this contextually salientproperty, the temporal evaluation of the predicate ship'in resulting Formula 53 is no longer governed by theexistential quantifier t for the future tense, but rather bythe quantifier t' introduced by the contextually salientproperty.
As a consequence of this instantiation of R,the set of ships under consideration is restricted in theappropriate way.52.
QUERY \[ ^ h z \[ z E POW \[h y 3 t' \[ ship' (y) (t')& R(y) (t')\]\] & 3 t \[ t > ts & t C_ tr& arrive' (Hawaii') (z) (t) \]\]\]53.

However, the point that I made earlier in thissection with respect o tracking saliency as a side effectof plan recognition applies to the tracking of propertiesintroduced by the linguistic context as well: trackingsuch properties is important not only for temporalevaluation, but is independently motivated by otherdiscourse phenomena such as anaphoric reference, asWebber (1978, 1983) has convincingly shown.8 A COMPOSITIONAL SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS OFTENSEIn the previous ections I have focused on the semanticand pragmatic aspects of my analysis of temporal ex-pressions, which concern in particular the features ofnarrow-scope assignment and of context-dependent in-terpretation of quantified NPs.
In this section I willconcentrate on matters of syntax and will demonstratehow the narrow-scope analysis makes it possible toconstruct a straightforward compositional syntax andsemantics of tense in the framework of MontagueGrammar, the linguistic theory on which my analysis isbased.Syntactically, tenses in English appear as inflectionalmorphemes on verbs.
In the notation of categorialgrammar, we may assign a syntactic tree as in (55) toSentence 54.
The infinitival form of the verb arrive ofCategory IV is combined with the past-tense morpheme-ed to form a tensed intrasensitive verb IV*.
Morpho-syntactically, tenses are therefore items that apply toindividual words.54.
Every ship arrived.55.
Every ship arrived, SEvery ship, S/IV* arrived, IV*Every, S/IV*/CN ship, CN arrive, IVSince I assign tense narrow scope in the semantics andlet temporal quantifiers bind only the temporal indexassociated with the main verb, I arrive at an analysis oftense whose syntactic domain coincides with its seman-tic domain.
Compared to analyses in which tense isassigned wide scope over formulas that correspond toentire sentences (Montague 1973) or over entire verbphrases (Bach 1980), the narrow-scope analysis, whichI have developed in this paper, has the advantage ofleading to a straightforward compositional syntax andsemantics of tense.
In the syntax the tense morphemeturns an untensed verb into its tensed counterpart,while the corresponding translation rule existentiallyquantifies over the time index of the predicate thattranslated the untensed verb.56.57.If a E pIV/"NP and then F~ (a) E pIV*/"NP, whereF~ = a-ed.If a E pIV/"NP and a translates into a', then F~ (a)translates intoAS~.

The notation IV/nNp thus stands foran IV followed by n slashed NPs.
The correspondingtranslation schema in (57) denotes a function from thetype of meanings associated with object NPs, if any, tofunctions from individuals to truth values.
Althoughthese rule schemata re rather technical, their meaningshould become clear when one considers a concreteexample.
Consider once again Example 54, whose syn-tax has been given in (53).54.
Every ship arrived.?
The translation of the entire sentence can be built up ina compositional fashion as in (57), which mirrors thesyntactic omposition of (53).58. arrived translates as:Ax \ [3 t ' \ [ t '<ts&t 'C_ t r&ar r ive ' (x ) ( t ' ) \ ] \ ]every translates as:A P A Q V x \[3 t \[ P (x) (t) & R (x) (t) \] ~ Q (x) \]every ship translates as:h Q V x \[3 t \[ ship' (x) (t) & R(x) (t) \] ---> Q(x) \]Every ship arr ived translates as:1. h Q V x \[3 t \[ship' (x) (t) & R(x) (t)\] ---> Q (x)\](h y \[3 t' \[t' < ts & t' c_ tr & arrive' (y) (t')\]\])2. v x \[3 t \[ship' (x) (t) & R (x) (t)\] -->h y \[ 3 t' \[t' < ts & t' C_ tr & arrive' (y) (t')\]\] (x)\]3.
V x \[3 t \[ship' (x) (t) & R (x) (t)\] --> 3 t' \[ t' < ts& t' C_ tr & arrive' (x) (t') \]\]The phrase every ship is formed by supplying thepredicate ship' as an argument o the translation ofevery.
Notice that R is introduced by the translation ofthe quantifier every.
The translation of the entire sen-tence is formed by supplying the translation of thetensed verb arrived, which is produced by the transla-tion rule in (57), to the translation of the subject NP.The reduced translation results from two steps oflambda reduction.9 CONCLUSIONIn this paper I have argued that a logical semantics fortemporal expressions can provide adequate representa-tions for natural-language input to an interface such asJANUS.
The temporal logic is based on Reichenbach'smodels for the semantics of English tense and usesmultiple indices for semantic interpretation.
This multi-indexed logic overcomes the kinds of problems thatarise when systems of tense logics are used that rely onjust one index of evaluation.I have demonstrated how giving narrow scope totense quantifiers enables us to provide adequate scoperelations with respect o NP quantifiers and to interpretsuch NPs relative to a given discourse context.
I haveargued that the context-dependent feature of the analy-sis does not add extra complexity to my treatment oft ime-dependent expressions, but is needed for purposesof discourse understanding in general.
Finally, I havedemonstrated how the narrow scope of tense results ina fully compositional syntax and semantics of tensedsentences in English.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe work presented here was supported under DARPAcontract #N00014-85-C-0016.

The components shown in the diagram are based on the architec-ture of the PHLIQUA system described in Scha 1983.3.
For details on how the domain model functions in the overallsystem see Ayuso, Shaked; and Weischedel 1987.4.
In fairness to Prior, it has to be pointed out that he designed histemporal modal ogics as purely formal systems and did not designthen't with idea of applying them to natural anguage.
However,Priorean tense logic has, nonetheless, been applied to naturallanguage semantics.
It is those studies that are subject o thecriticisms presented in sections 4.1-4.4.5.
Recall that Fawn Hall, North's secretary, testified before thecommittee when she was no longer North's secretary.
Theexample is due to an editorial in the Boston Globe.6.
The reader may prefer some other approach to the semantics ofplurals or questions, ay the lattice-theoretic approach to pluralitydeveloped in Link 1983 or the analysis of questions found inGroenendijk/Stokhof 1982 over the approach based on power setsand the QUERY operator, respectively.
These approaches arealso consistent with the point that I want to concentrate on withrespect o the formula in (42)---that is, the instantiation of thecontext-dependent predicate (R).7.
Note that it follows from the narrow-scope analysis of tensedeveloped in Section 4 that the time at which the set of objects xare ships need not be the same as the time at which that set ofobjects is in the Indian Ocean.
This aspect of (42) may strike thereader as counterintuitive.
Notice, however, that (42) representsthe first level of translation (the EFL level of Figure 2 with noinput from the domain model).
It will be part of the domainknowledge, however, that there are two kinds of properties: a.properties uch as being an admiral, which can hold of anindividual for certain subperiods; and b. properties such as beinga ship, which hold of an entity throughout i s existence.
It is onthe basis of such domain knowledge that at lower levels oftranslation the two evaluation times at issue in (42) can, in fact, beequated.8.
What is interesting about the example in its own right is thatsyntactically there is no plural noun phrase in the precedingdiscourse that could serve as the referent for the plural pronounthey.9.
I am indebted to Bonnie Webber for pointing out to me that thediscourse ntity evoked by (45a) can be used to restrict theinterpretation f the noun phrase which ships in (45c), only if theanswer to (45a) is affirmative.
Thus, whether a discourse ntitycan serve as a restrictor for the interpretation f subsequent NP'sis in part a function of the type of sentence that evokes thediscourse ntity.
If the expression that evokes a discourse ntityoccurs in a declarative sentence, the discourse ntity will auto-matically be available as a potential restrictor for the interpreta-tion of subsequent NPs.
However, if the discourse ntity isevoked within an interrogative s ntence and the existence of theenZity is not already presupposed by the question, the discourseentity is licensed as a potential restrictor, only if the question hasan affirmative answer.14 Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988
