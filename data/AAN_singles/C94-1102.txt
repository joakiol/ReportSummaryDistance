Non-direct ional i ty and Self -Assessmentin an Example-based SystemUsing Genetic A lgor i thmsYves LepageBahagian Sains Komputer, PP Sains Matc,natik & Sains Komputer,Universifi Sains Malaysia, I Igo0 Penang, Malaysiae-mail: lepage@cs.usm.jpre,arch done at ATR Interpreting Telecommunications Research L.abs,Hi -Gari-dai 2-2, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, 619-02 Kyoto, JapanAbstractWe show the application of an optimisation technique tonatural language processing: genetic algorithms, thanksto the definition of a data structure called board anda formal distance.
The system hms two interestingfeatures: non-directionality, whict~ Ls more than hi-directionality, and self-assessment, independently of theinner knowledge.
Results of experiments are presentedand discussed.Top lea l  paper :  So f tware  for NLPIntroductionThe purpose of this article is to show that an engineb~ed on an optimisation teclmique, namely genetic al-gorlthras, can perform NLP t~usks: analysis and gener-ation in the frame of example-based approaches.
Butmore than that, the system we have built has interestingproperties:?
it is truly non-directional, i.e.
it performs morethan bi-directional tasks;?
it evaluates its results relatively to tile input, andnot relatively to its internal knowledge.Two original facts make this possible:?
the definition of a data structure, called boardwhich is in essence bidirectional.
It is the Kssocia-tiou of a sentence pattern m~d its linguistic struc-ture;?
the definition of a ,distance on this data structure.1 Motivations1.1.
Non-d i reet iona l i tyOur mMn motivation was to design a system where notonly the formalism but also the system engine is bi-directional.
In \[Lepage 91\], we sketched such an enginetbr a rule-based al)proach.From a theoretical point of view, such a system isalso more interesting than a system where, although theformalism would be bi-directional, analysis and genera-Lion would be separate modules resulting from differentcompilations.In our sketch, a more general property than bi-direc-t:ionality mue,'go,?
: ,ro,>direclioTJagil!l.
IGdirectionalityis just the property of executing analysis and genera-tion with the same set of specifications, whereas nou-directionality allows more: a complete sentence and itscomplete analysis can be built from a partial specifica-tion of the sentence and a partial description of tile as-sociated structure.1.2 Sel f -assessmentA second motivation lles in a flaw of rule-based systemsusing context-flee parsers, which is that they often failto deliver a solution for trivia\[ reasons such ~ a wordmissing in a dictionary.
On the contrary, our system al.-ways delivers an output for any input, would the solutionbe "bad".
O\[" course, this woukl be of no meaning if thequality of outputs wotfid not be evahtated.
IIence, whendelivering a solution, the system scores it.Some machine translation systems viewed as expertsystems may return an evaluation of their work in termsof their knowledge (grammar) \[Tong 89\], some other mayevaluate the result according to thesaurus cl~ssificatlonand statistical frequencies \[Furuse and lida 92b1, but allthese methods are specific.
Ifere, on the contrary, thesystem delivers a score which is a formal distance be-tween the input and the output.
Thus, it is independentof the linguistic representation chosen (dependency orconstituency).
'\[Fhis is not the case of a proposal such as\[llarrison el al.
91\].

'l'hey are a collection of techniquesfor approaching the solution of optimisation problems\[Cloldberg 89\].On tim contrary to usual programndng techniqueswhich handle only one object, at.
a time, genetic algo-rithms deal wit& a collection of individuals, called a pop-ulatiou.
For each individual, one can compute a funct.ion,called the filT+ess flutction.
Those individuals for whichthe fitness fm~ction is optimmn,'are the besl i.ndividuals.From two individm~.ls, one can derive two Imw imli-vldunls by cuttinv: lheu!

Some random modiIication of the childrenmay occur, accounting for mutalion to complete the ge-netic metaphor.N~AYl Nnza, va\],'ignre 1: I~rinciple of crossoverTim previous operation can be rel)eated over a popu-lation a number of times so that populations follow oneanother.
In the l,.~t generalion, the best individuals arehopefidly solutions of the optimisation problem at hand.In order to apply genetic algorithms to natural lan-guage processing, one hms to determine:?
which data has to play the role of individuals;?
consequently, what a population will be;?
for an individual, wlmt its fitness is;?
in a population, how individuals are selected forcrossover and how it is performed;?
how analysis and generation can be viewed as op-t imisation problems on a population.
'l?he meeting of our research interests with genetic alegorithrns is a consequence of wirious awulable results.Firstly, the need for linguistic specification of corn-pnter grammars led to the proposal of an original datastructure called board.
This data structure is neutralwith respect o ahalysis and generation.
It will play therole of individuals.
Boards rely on the data structureof forests, \[br which it is possible to define a crossovermethod.Secondly, tim stream of exainl)le-b~sed machine trans-lation is now well-established and justifies considering acollection of already parsed sentences as a population\[Sadler and Vendelmans 90\], \[Sate and Nagao 90\].Finally, our recent work on distances, and especiallyon distances between uncompletely specified boards, ledlls to the idea of looking in a data base for boards withthe closest distance to a given board.
This is an optimi-sation l)roblem and the tltness of any board will simplybe a tilnction of its distance to the given board.In the following we will first describe the data struc-tures used.
Then we will define the finlctions workingon these data structures.2.1 .
Data  s t ruet ;ures2.1.1 Ind iv idua ls  = BoardsThe board data structure \[Vauquois and Chaplmy 85\]w~s introduced ~s an answer to the problem of speci-fication of real-size graminars.
A board is the associa.tion of a text with its corresponding, linguistic structure.Moreover, constraints express the linguistic validity ofthe fine-grained correspondences between different partsof the texts and of the structure \[Better and Zaharin 88\],\[Zaliarin and Lepage 92\].

As a matterof fact, a string is a forest with only o.lle level, and a treeis a forest with only one node on the highest level.
Now,as forests are the underlying data type, variables tandnaturally for subforests.
On the string side, consideringVariables as forests is by far more interesting than if theywould instantiate with one word only.An interesting property about the board data struc-ture, and it is exactly why it has been devised, is that,because it is the association of a string (the text) and a(linguistic) tree, it is neutral with respect to the mainnatural language processing operations:i analysis (input: string, output: tree);?
generation (input: tree, output: string).2.1.2 Po I )u la t lon  = Data  lmse of l )oardsOur database of sentences is that of ATR telephoneconversations.

.617The linguistic structures corresponding to the previ-ous sentences have been drawn by hand and scrupulouslyreviewed to ensure consistency.
They are syntactic on-stituency trees and are exactly projective, which meansthat each leaf in the tree corresponds to a word in thesentence in the same order.As for illustration, all the trees and sentences in thispaper are extracted from our data base of boards.
Somerepresentational choices have been made to limit thenumber of morpho-syntactic categories to 14 (and phrasetypes to 7) and to keep projectivity by all means.2.2 Pnnet ions2.2.1 F i tness  = D is tance  between forestsWe define the fitness of an element in a population (setof boards) ms the distance to a given input (a board) tothe system.
In other words, we have to define a distancebetween boards.
A simple idea is to take the sum of thedistances between the strings on the one band, and thetrees on the other hand.
As strings and trees are forestsa distance on forests is required.The definition of a distance on forests is given below,with a, b being nodes, u, u ~, v, .v ~ being forests and .denoting concatenation of forests.dist(a(u') .u,  b(v').v) = m/n(di~t(a(u'), e) =di~t(~(,,'), b(,,'))dis l (a,b)  =dist(E,a) :=dist(a,E) =di~t(a(,,'),b) + di~t(u,v),di~i(a(u') ,e) "1- di~t(u,b(v').v),dist(Gb(u')) + di~t(a(u').,,,u))<u,t(<,, ~) 4- <u~(,,', ~-)dist(a,b) -I- dist(u',v')0 if a=b1 else (replaeeme)H)1 ( insert ion)1 (deletion)It is a direct generMisation of two classical distanceson strings \[Wagner & Fischer 74\] and trees \[Selkow 77\].Both distances answer the correction problem: whatis the minimal number of typing operations needed totransform one object into the other one?
In both dis-tances and their generalisation to forests, the typing op-erations are insertion, deletion and replacementAn extension of the previous distance to forest pat-terns (i.e.
forests containing variables) has been pre-sented in \[Lepage tal .
92\].
It is no longer a metric, soWe call it a proximity score.
With this score, the dis-tance between a variable and a constant object is zeroby definition.
Figure 5 gives an illustration (the unit isa one word or node difference).2.2.2 Crossover  = Exchange of subfore.stsWe turn now to crossover.
The first question is howb,_..(Is a\]re selected in a population for crossover.It seems reasonable that those individuals with betterfitness value should intervene more in the production ofthe next generation.
Along this line, the simple followinglaw gives the probability of a board i with fitness f l(some reciprocal of distance) to be selected for crossover:f~Pi =As for crossover itself, it has to be defined on stringsand on trees.On strings, be they chromosomes or sequences of bii,s,crossover is generally performed as ilhlstrated in Fig-ure 1.
We could crossow'.r sentences following this sitnplel,riitclple (see Figure 6).be:fore crossover  a f te r  c rossover"Th~nk you vory much."
"Thank you ha lp  you.
""May I help you?"
iiMtty I very  mtlch,"Figure 6: Crossover on stringsBut we insist on keeping the unity of data struc-ture between strings and trees.
So, we translate stringcrossover into forest terms: it is the exchange of the sis-ter forests of the crossover points.
This can be applieddirectly to trees, see Figure 7.
This technique is differentfrom the exchange of subtrees ~s proposed in \[Koza 92\].before  crossover  a f te r  c rossoverS S. .

Hence, ana\[ysis and generation turn out tolie only l/articular cases of this general operation.
Thist'eatnre is what we called ares-directionality.
It is moregeneral than hi-directionality.
Until now, we are notaware of any m~tural language processing system havingthis property.Frorn the applications point of view, non--directionali-ty allows one to envisage linguistically fotmded editingoperations.
For example, suppose we would like to re-place refltnd the fee by pay *lte fee back all over a text.We would like tile operation to apply for any tense ofthe verb.
Tim Rlllowing I/oard could be used to retrieveall possible candidates.
It says tllat we want a w'.rbalphrase (structural constraint) and that tile substring fl'.emust appear (string constraint).
