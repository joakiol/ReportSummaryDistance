REAL-TIME SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMHy Murveit and Mitchel WeintraubSRI InternationalMenlo Park, CA 94025PROJECT GOALSSRI and U.C.Berkeley are developing hardware for a real-time implementation f spoken language systems (SLS).
Ourgoal is to develop fast speech recognition algorithms and sup-porting hardware capable of recognizing continuous speech froma bigram or trigram based 20,000 word vocabulary or a 1,000 to5,000 word SLS system.RECENT RESULTSSRI and U.C.
Berkeley's recent accomplishments on thisproject include:Eight special-purpose IC's were designed, fabricated andtested.Designed, fabricated, and tested the Outtput-Distributionprinted-circuit board.
The Output_Distribution board com-putes and loads HMM state output probabilities onto theHMM Word-Processor board.Designed, fabricated, and tested the HMM Word-Processorprinted-circuit board.
The HMM Word-Processor boardupdates HMM state probabilities.Developed software to support he hardware ffort.
Thisincludes the following software modules: simulation, sys-tem initialization, control program coordinating differenthardware components, and the grammar computation on theSKY Challenger dual-processor TMS32030.Ported current noise-robust oftware algorithms (from Sym-bolics Lisp Machine) to run on a Sun Sparcstation i C.Ported this C implementation to a Banshee TMS32030 torun in real-time.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARComplete the construction of the current hardware design,and software tools to support this architecture.Design a multiple-processor TMS320C30 board with a highI/O bandwidth to interface with the special-purpose HMM-board, and an interface to the MTU A/D box to compute thefront-end VQ values.Develop a large vocabulary recognizer to fully use the com-putational capabilities of this design.Implement multiple types of grammars using this hardware.Use the real=time hardware for collecting data about man-machine speech interactions.Integrate the real-time recognizer into our research trainer toshorten the development cycle for corrective-training sys-telns.Evaluate the current architecture todetermine the computa-tional and algorithmic bottlenecks.Repficate the system and port to a DARPA and NASA site.424
