Using thePenn Discourse Treebank, we investi-gate what information relevant to in-ferring discourse relations is conveyedby discourse connectives, and whetherthe specificity of discourse relations re-flects general cognitive biases for estab-lishing coherence.
We also propose anapproach to measure the effect of a dis-course marker on sense identificationaccording to the different levels of a re-lation sense hierarchy.
This will open away to the computational modeling ofdiscourse processing.1 IntroductionA central question in psycholinguistic model-ing is the development of models for humansentence processing difficulty.
An approachthat has received a lot of interest in recentyears is the information-theoretic measure ofsurprisal (Hale, 2001).
Recent studies haveshown that surprisal can successfully accountfor a range of psycholinguistic effects (Levy,2008), as well as account for effects in nat-uralistic broad-coverage texts (Demberg andKeller, 2008; Roark et al 2009; Frank, 2009;Mitchell et al 2010).
: what work of Roarkand Frank you mean here?
Under the no-tion of the Uniform Information Density hy-pothesis (UID, Levy and Jaeger, 2007; Frankand Jaeger, 2008), surprisal has also beenused to explain choices in language produc-tion: When their language gives people theoption to choose between different linguisticencodings, people tend to choose the encod-ing that distributes the information more uni-formly across the sentence (where the informa-tion conveyed by a word is its surprisal).When using surprisal as a cognitive modelof processing difficulty, we hypothesize thatthe processing difficulty incurred by the hu-man when processing the word is proportionalto the update of the interpretation, i.e.
the in-formation conveyed by the word (Hale, 2001;Levy, 2008).
We can try to estimate partic-ular aspects of the information conveyed by aword, e.g., the information conveyed about thesyntactic structure of the sentence, the seman-tic interpretation, or about discourse relationswithin the text.This paper does not go all the way toproposing a model of discourse relation sur-prisal, but discusses first steps towards amodel for the information conveyed by dis-course connectors about discourse relations,based on available resources like the Penn Dis-course Treebank (Prasad et al 2008).
First,we quantify how unambiguously specific dis-course relations are marked by their typicalconnectors (Section 4.1) and test whether eas-ily inferable relations are on average markedmore ambiguously than relations which areless expected according to the default assump-tion of a reader.
This idea is shaped withrespect to the UID hypothesis: expected re-lations can afford to be signaled by weakermarkers and less expected ones should bemarked by strong connectors in order to keepthe discourse-level information density smooththroughout the text (Section 4.2).
We theninvestigate in more detail the types of ambi-guity that a reader might face when process-ing discourse relations.
While some ambigui-ties lie in discourse connectors, it also happensthat more than one relation exist at the sametime between two text spans.
We show that84some discourse markers also signal the pres-ence of several relations (Section 5).
In com-putational modeling as well as laboratory set-ups, one should therefore have a strategy todeal with the different types of ambiguities.Finally, we ask what granularity of distinctionfrom other discourse relations (with respect tothe PDTB relation sense hierarchy) each En-glish discourse connective conveys (Section 6).2 Discourse Relations and theirMarkersA cognitive approach to discourse process-ing emphasizes on the procedural role of theconnectives to constrain the way readers re-late the propositions in a text (Blakemore,1992; Blass, 1993).
Experimental findingssuggest that these markers can facilitate theinference of specific discourse relations (De-gand and Sanders, 2002), and that discourseconnectors are processed incrementally Ko?hneand Demberg (2013).
People can however in-fer discourse relations also in the absence ofdiscourse connecotrs, relying on the propo-sitional content of the sentences and theirworld-knowledge (Hobbs, 1979; Asher andLascarides, 1998).
Asr and Demberg (2012b)point out that similar inferences are also nec-essary for discourse relations which are onlymarked with a weak connector which can beused for many relations, such as and.
Further-more, we know that the inference of discourserelations is affected by a set of general cog-nitive biases.
To illuminate the role of thesefactors let?s have a look at (1).
While the typeof relation between the two events is clearly in-ferable in (1-a) and (1-b) due to the discourseconnectives, in (1-c), the reader would haveto access their knowledge, e.g., about Harry(from larger context) or the usual affairs be-tween bosses and employees, in order to con-struct a discourse relation.
(1) a.
The boss was angry because Harry skippedthe meeting (reason).b.
The boss was angry, so Harry skipped themeeting (result).c.
The boss was angry and Harry skipped themeeting.Here, not only both reason and result inter-pretations but even an independent parallel re-lation (simple Conjunction) between the twoevents are possible to be inferred as a relativelyneutral connective, i.e., and is used.
Levinson(2000) notes in his discussion on presumptivemeanings that ?when events are conjoined theytend to be read as temporally successive and ifat all plausible, as causally linked?.
If this istrue then the result reading is most probablefor (1-c).
General preferences of this kind havebeen investigated via experimental approaches(Segal et al 1991; Murray, 1997; Sanders,2005; Kuperberg et al 2011).
Segal et al(1991) and Murray (1997) argue that readersexpect a sentence to be continuous with re-spect to its preceding context (the continuityhypothesis).
Continuous discourse relations interms of congruency and/or temporality areconsequently easier to process than the dis-continuous ones.
Sanders (2005) proposes thatcausal relatedness entails the maximum degreeof coherence in a text, therefore readers alwaysstart by attempting to find cause-consequencerelations between neighboring sentences (thecausality-by-default hypothesis).
In a similarvein, Kuperberg et al(2011) shows that read-ers face comprehension difficulty when sen-tences in short text spans cannot be put intocausal relation and no marker of other rela-tions (e.g., Concession) is available.Taken together, these findings suggest thatworld knowledge, general cognitive biases, andlinguistic features of the sentences such as thepresence of a weak or strong marker contributeto the relational inference.
With a look backto the information theoretic approach to thelinguistic patterns, one could hypothesize thatwhen one factor is strongly triggering expec-tation for a specific type of relation the otherfactors could remain silent in order to keep theinformation distribution uniform.
With thisperspective, Asr and Demberg (2012a) testedwhether the predictability of discourse rela-tions due to general cognitive biases (towardscausality and continuity) can explain the pres-ence vs. absence of the discourse connectors.They found that connectors were more likelyto be dropped in the more predictable (causalor continuous) relations than in others.
Ourinvestigation of the explicit relations in thispaper (the first experiment) looks into thisquestion in a stricter manner considering howmuch information a connective delivers aboutdiscourse relations.
Since this information is85Figure 1: Hierarchy of senses in PDTB(Prasad et al 2008)closely related to the ambiguities a connec-tive removes (or maybe adds to the context)in the course of reading, we dedicate a sepa-rate section in this paper to illuminate differ-ent types of ambiguities.
Also, a more detailquestion would be what types of informa-tion a connective can convey about one or sev-eral discourse relations.
To our best of knowl-edge there has been no corpus-based study sofar about this last point which we will try tomodel in our third experiment.3 Penn Discourse TreebankThe Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB, Prasadet al 2008) is a large corpus annotated withdiscourse relations, (covering the Wall StreetJournal part of the Penn Treebank).
The an-notation includes sentence connectives, spansof their arguments and the sense of discourserelations implied by the connectives.
The rela-tion labels are chosen according to a hierarchyof senses (Figure 1).
Annotators were askedto find the Explicit discourse connectives andrespectively select a sense (as much specific aspossible) from the hierarchy.
For neighboringsentences where no explicit marker existed inthe original text they were asked to first inserta suitable connective between the two argu-ments and then annotate a relation sense, inthis case categorized as Implicit.
If an expres-sion ?
not belonging to the list of constitutedconnectives ?
in one of the involved sentencesis already indicative of a specific relation, theninstead they marked that expression and putthe relation into the AltLex category.
In allof our experiments only the explicit relationare considered.
Some connectives were anno-tated with two sense labels in the PDTB.
Inour analyses below, we count these text spanstwice (i.e., once for each sense), resulting in atotal of 19,458 relation instances.4 Are Unexpected RelationsStrongly Marked?4.1 Markedness MeasurePoint-wise mutual information (pmi) is aninformation-theoretic measure of associationbetween two factors.
For our purpose of mea-suring the markedness degree of a relation r inthe corpus, we calculate the normalized pmi ofit with any of the connectives, written as c thatit co-occurs with:npmi(r; c) =pmi(r; c)?
log p(r, c)=log p(r,c)p(r)p(c)?
log p(r, c)=log p(r)p(c)log p(r, c)?
1npmi is calculated in base 2 and ranges be-tween ?1 and 1.
For our markedness measure,we scale it to the interval of [0, 1] and weigh itby the probability of the connector given therelation.0 <npmi(r; c) + 12< 1markedness(r) =?cp(c|r)npmi(r; c) + 12Intuitively, the markedness measure tells uswhether a relation has very specific markers(high markedness) or whether it is usuallymarked by connectors that also mark manyother relations (low markedness).4.2 Discourse Expectations andMarker StrengthGiven the markedness measure, we are nowable to test whether those relations which aremore expected given general cognitive biases860.62?0.64?0.66?0.68?0.7?0.72?0.74?0.76?Temporal?(3696)?

(expecting continuous and causal relations)are marked less strongly than e.g.
discontinu-ous relations.
Figure 2 compares the marked-ness associated to the explicit relations of thePDTB when the first level relation sense dis-tinction is considered.Figure 2 shows that COMPARISON rela-tions exhibit higher markedness than otherrelations, meaning that discontinuity ismarked with little ambiguity, i.e.
markersof COMPARISON relations are only very rarelyused in other types of discourse relations.COMPARISON relations are exactly those rela-tions which were classified in Asr and Demberg(2012a) as a class of discontinuous relations.Further experimental evidence also shows thatthese relations are more likely to cause pro-cessing difficulty than others when no connec-tor is present (Murray, 1997), and that theirmarkers have a more strongly disruptive effectthan other markers when used incorrectly.
Un-der the information density view, these obser-vations can be interpreted as markers for com-parison relations causing a larger context up-date.
The high markedness of COMPARISON re-lations is thus in line with the hypothesis thatunpredictable relations are marked strongly.CONTINGENCY relations, on the other hand,exhibit a lower score of markedness.
Thisindeed complies with the prediction ofthe causality-by-default hypothesis (Sanders,2005) in conjunction with the UID hypothe-sis: causal relations can still be easily inferredeven in the presence of ambiguous connectivesbecause they are preferred by default.As also discussed in Asr and Demberg(2012a), some types of EXPANSION relationsare continuous while others are discontinuous;finding that the level of markedness is near theaverage of all relations therefore comes as nosurprise.More interesting is the case of TEMPORALrelations: these relations have low marked-ness, even though this class includes contin-uous (temporal succession) relations as well asdiscontinuous (temporal precedence) relations,and we would thus have expected a higher levelof markedness than we actually find.
Evenwhen calculating markedness at the more fine-grained relation distinction level, did not finda significant difference between the marked-ness of the temporally forward vs. backwardrelations.
A low level of markedness meansthat the connectors used to mark temporal re-lations are also used to mark other relations,in particular, temporal connectives are oftenused to mark CONTINGENCY relations.
Thisobservation brings us to the question of gen-eral patterns of ambiguity in discourse markersand the ambiguity of discourse relations them-selves, see Section 5.5 Ambiguous Connectivevs.
Ambiguous RelationSome discourse connectives (e.g., since, whichcan be temporal or causal, or while, which canbe temporal or contrastive) are ambiguous.
Inthis section, we would like to distinguish be-tween three different types of ambiguity (allwith respect to the PDTB relation hierarchy):1.
A connector expressing different relations,where it is possible to say that one but notthe other relation holds between the textspans, for example since.2.
A connector expressing a class of relationsbut being ambiguous with respect to thesubclasses of that relation, for examplebut, which always expresses a COMPARISONrelationship but may express any subtypeof the comparison relation.3.
the ambiguity inherent in the relation be-tween two text spans, where several rela-87Relation pair #R1 (total) #R2 (total) #Pair ?2T.Synchrony?CON.Cause.reason 507 (1594) 353 (1488) 187 1.08E+00T.Asynchronous.succession?CON.Cause.reason 189 (1101) 353 (1488) 159 2.43E+02 ***E.Conjunction?CON.Cause.result 352 (5320) 162 (752) 140 2.22E+02 ***T.Synchrony?EXP.Conjunction 507 (1594) 352 (5320) 123 5.43E+01 ***?T.Synchrony?CON.Condition.reneral 507 (1594) 70 (362) 52 1.67E+01 ***T.Synchrony?COM.Contrast.juxtaposition 507 (1594) 77 (1186) 45 1.97E+00T.Asynchronous.precedence?E.Conjunction 66 (986) 352 (5320) 36 1.15E+01 ***T.Synchrony?COM.Contrast 507 (1594) 37 (2380) 28 9.55E+00 ***T.Synchrony?COM.Contrast.opposition 507 (1594) 28 (362) 21 6.78E+00 **Table 1: Most frequent co-occurring relations in the PDTB, their frequency among multi-labels(and in the entire corpus)tions can be identified to hold at the sametime.The first and second notion of ambiguity re-fer to what we so far have been talking about:we showed that some connectors mark canmark differnt types of relations, and that someconnectives marking a general relation typebut not marking specific subrelations.The third type of ambiguity is also anno-tated in the PDTB.
Relations which are am-biguous by nature are either labeled with acoarse-grained sense in the hierarchy (e.g.,COMPARISON.Contrast the second most fre-quent label in the corpus chosen by the anno-tators when they could not agree on a morespecific relation sense), or are labelled withtwo senses.
Table 1 lists which two relationsenses were most often annotated to hold atthe same time in the PDTB, along with theindividual frequency (also frequency in theentire corpus inside brackets).
Sub-types ofCause and TEMPORAL relations appear mostoften together, while TEMPORAL.Synchrony isa label that appears significantly more thanexpected among the multi-label instances,even with a higher frequency than that ofEXPANSION.Conjunction, the most frequentlabel in the corpus.
Such observations confirmthe existence of the third type of ambiguity indiscourse relations.Interestingly, these inherently ambiguousrelations also have their own specific mark-ers, such as meanwhile which occurs in about70% of its instances with two relation senses1.1This connective is mostly labeled withTEMPORAL.Synchrony and EXPANSION.Conjunction.Interestingly these two labels appear together signif-icanly less frequently than expected (as marked inthe table with ***?)
but when such a cooccurrancehappened in the corpus it has been for the connectivemeanwhile.On the other hand, other well-known ambigu-ous connectors like since rarely mark inher-ently ambiguous relations, and most often canbe identified as one specific relation sense bylooking at the content of the arguments.
Theimportance of the possibility to annotate asecond sense and hence explicitly mark theinherently ambiguous relations has also beenpointed out by Versley (2011).
In fact, a con-nective like meanwhile can be thought of asdelivering information not only about the pos-sible relation senses it can express, but alsoabout the fact that two discourse relationshold simultaneously.In conclusion, it is possible that more thanone discourse relation hold between two textspans.
We believe that taking into accountthe different types of ambiguity in discourserelations can also benefit automatic discourserelation classification methods, that so far ig-nore multiple relation senses.
Relations withtwo senses mostly include one temporal sense.This also (at least partially) explains the lowlevel of markedness of temporal relations inFigure 2.
Of particular interest is also the find-ing that there seem to be specific connectorssuch as meanwhile which are used to mark in-herently ambiguous relations.6 Type of Information Conveyedby a Discourse ConnectorIn this experiment, we focus on the differ-ences among individual connectives in reflect-ing information about discourse relations fromcoarse to fine grained granularity.6.1 Measure of Information GainThe mutual information between two discretevariables which is indicative of the amount ofuncertainty that one removes for inference of88the other, can be decomposed in the followingmanner:I(X;Y ) =?cp(c)?rp(r|c) logp(r|c)p(r)The inner sum is known as Kullback-Leibler di-vergence or relative entropy of the distributionof relations p(r) independent of the connectorc and the distribution of relations p(r|c) af-ter observing c2.
The relative entropy thusquantifies in how far knowing the connector cchanges the distribution of relations.gain(c) = DKL(p(r|c)||p(r))This formulation also allows us to calculatethe change in distribution for different levels ofthe PDTB relation sense hierarchy and thus toanalyse which connectors convey informationabout which level of the hierarchy.
We definethe measure of enhancement to formalize thisnotion:enhancementxy(c) = gainy(c)?
gainx(c)The enhancementxy(c) indicates the amountof information delivered by cue c for theclassification of the instances into finer-grained relation subtypes.
For exam-ple, enhancement01(because) describes howmuch information gain because providesfor distinguishing the level-1 relations itmarks from other relations.
Similarly,high enhancement23(because) indicates thatthis connective is important for distinguish-ing among level 3 relations (here, distin-guishing CONTINGENCY.Cause.reason fromCONTINGENCY.Cause.result relations), whilelow enhancement23(if) indicates that if doesnot contribute almost any information fordistinguishing among the subtypes of theCONTINGENCY.Condition relation.2Note that this formulation is closely related to sur-prisal: Levy (2008) shows that surprisal(wk+1) =?
logP (wk+1|w1..wk) is equivalent to the KL diver-gence D(P (T |w1..j+1)||P (T |w1..j)) for ?any stochas-tic generative process P , conditioned on some (pos-sibly null) external context, that generates completestructures T , each consisting at least partly of sur-face strings to be identified with serial linguistic in-put?.
Note however that in our current formula-tion of a discourse relation, the simplification to gen-eral structure-independent surprisal does not hold(DKL(p(r|c)||p(r)) 6= ?
log p(c)) because our relations(as they are defined here) do not satisfy the above con-dition for T , in particular, P (r, c) 6= P (r).6.2 Connective Help in HierarchicalClassificationFigure 3 shows the amount of enhancementfor 27 frequent (> 100 occurrences) connec-tives in the corpus in three transitions, namelyfrom no information to the first level classifi-cation, from first to the second level and fromsecond to the third.
Most of the connectivescontribute most strongly at the coarsest levelof classification, i.e., their L1-Root enhance-ment is the highest.
In particular, we find thatsome of the most frequent connectives such asbut, and, and also only help distinguishing dis-course relation meaning at the coarsest level ofthe PDTB relation hierarchy, but contributelittle to distinguish among e.g.
different sub-types of COMPARISON or EXPANSION.
An inter-esting observation is also that frequent mark-ers of comparison relations but, though, stilland however provide almost no informationabout the second or third level of the hierar-chy.Another group of connectors, for example,instead, indeed and or contribute significantlymore information in transition from the firstto the second level.
These are specific markersof some level-2 relation senses.
Among these,instead and or even help more for the deepestclassification3.Temporal and causal connectives such as be-fore, after, so, then ,when and thus have morecontribution to the deepest classification level.This reflects the distinctions employed in thedefinition of the third level senses which hasa direct correlation with the temporal order-ing, i.e., forward vs. backward transition be-tween the involved sentences.
In other words,regardless of whatever high-level class of rela-tion such markers fit in, the temporal infor-mation they hold make them beneficial for the3rd level classification.There are also a few connectives (if, indeed,for example) that convey a lot of informationabout the distinctions made at the first andsecond level of the hierarchy, but not about thethird level.
The reason for this is either thatthe third level distinction can only be madebased on the propositional information in the3Markers of EXPANSION.Alternative.conjunctionand EXPANSION.Alternative.chosen alternative re-spectively.890?0.5?1?1.5?2?2.5?3?

ordered left to right by frequency.arguments (this is the case for the sub-typesof conditionals), or that the connector usuallymarks a relation which does not have a thirdlevel (e.g., for example is a good marker ofthe EXPANSION.Instantiation relation whichdoes not have any subtypes).It is worth noting that a sum over enhance-ments obtained in the three levels results in thetotal relative entropy the distribution of dis-course relations before vs. after encounteringthe connective.
As expected, ambiguous con-nectors of the first type of ambiguity (while,since, when) convey a little bit of informationat each level of distinction, while overall in-formation gain is relatively small.
Ambigu-ous connectors of the second type of ambigu-ity (e.g., but, and, if ) convey almost no infor-mation about specific sub-types of relations.Finally, markers of inherently ambiguous rela-tions (meanwhile) stand out for very low in-formation gain at all levels.6.3 DiscussionThe notion of the information conveyed by adiscourse connector about a discourse relationcan also help to explain two previous find-ings on the relative facilitative effect of causaland adversative connectors, that at first glanceseem contradictory.While Murray (1997) showed a generallymore salient effect for a group of adversativecues such as however, yet, nevertheless andbut compared with causal connectives there-fore, so, thus and consequently, others reporteddifferent patterns when particular pairs of con-nectives were compared: Caron et al(1988)found greater inference activity and recall ac-curacy for because sentences than sentencesconnected with but.
Also, Millis and Just(1994) found a faster reading time and bet-ter response to the comprehension questionsin the case of because than that of althoughsentences.
Interestingly, by looking at Figure3, we find that because is a more constrain-ing connective than but and even although,given that the information gain obtain by thisconnective in all levels of relation classifica-tion is greater than that of but and although.While adversative connectives are reliable sig-nals to distinguish comparison relations in ahigh-level from the other three major types ofrelations, most causal connectives deliver spe-cific information down to the finer grains.
Inparticular, because is a distinguished marker ofthe reason relation; hence, it should be associ-ated with a more constraining discourse effect,while a generally used connective such as butcan serve as the marker of a variety of adver-sative relations, e.g., a simple Contrast vs. aConcession relation.The information-theoretic view can also ac-count for the larger facilitating effect of highlyconstraining causal and adversative connec-tives on discourse comprehension comparedto additive connectives such as and, also andmoreover (Murray, 1995, 1997; Ben-Anath,2006).
We also can see from the Figure 3 thatthe mentioned additive connectives show a rel-atively lower sum of enhancement.In summary, the broad classification of a dis-course connector (Murray, 1997; Halliday andHasan, 1976) is not the only factor that deter-mines how constraining it is, or how difficult itwill be to process.
Instead, one should look atits usage in different context (i.e., specificityof the connective usage in the natural text).For example, based on the measurements pre-sented in the Figure 3 we would expect a rel-atively high constraining effect of the connec-tives such as for example and instead.
Note90however that these predictions strongly de-pend on the discourse relation sense inventoryand the discourse relation hierarchy.
In partic-ular, it is important to ask in how far compu-tational linguistics resources, like the PDTB,reflect the inference processes in humans ?
inhow far are the sense distinction and hierar-chical classification cognitively adequate?7 Discussion and ConclusionDiscourse Relation Hierarchy and Fea-ture Space Dimensions Psycholingusiticmodels that need to be trained on annotateddata from computational linguistics resourcesalso have to be concerned about the psycholin-guistic adequacy of the annotation.
In par-ticular, for a model of discourse relation sur-prisal, we need to ask which discourse relationsare relevant to humans, and which distinctionsbetween relations are relevant to them?
Forexample, it may be possible that the distinc-tion between cause and consequence (3rd levelPDTB hierarchy) is more important in the in-ference process than the distinction betweenconjunction and list (2nd level PDTB hierar-chy).
Given the fact that more than one dis-course relation (or none) can hold between twotext segments, one should also ask whether ahierarchy is the right way to think about thediscourse relation senses at all ?
it might bemore adequate to think about discourse con-nectives conveying information about tempo-rality, causality, contrast etc, with each con-nector possibly conveying information aboutmore than one of these aspects at the sametime.These questions are also relevant for auto-matic discourse relation identification: manyapproaches to discourse relation identificationhave simplified the task to only distinguishbetween e.g.
the level-1 sense distinctions, orlevel-2 distinctions (Versley, 2011; Lin et al2011; Hernault et al 2011; Park and Cardie,2012), but may be missing to differentiate as-pects that are important also for many textinterpretation tasks, such as distinguishing be-tween causes and consequences.Towards discourse relation surprisal Acomputational model of discourse relation sur-prisal would have to take the actual local con-text into account, i.e.
factors other than justthe connective, and model the interplay of dif-ferent factors in the arguments of the discourserelation.
We would then be in a position toargue about the predictability of a specific in-stance of a discourse relation, as opposed toarguing based on general cognitive biases suchas the causality-by-default or continuity hy-potheses.From the three studies in this paper, we notethat our findings so far are compatible witha surprisal account at the discourse relationlevel: The first study showed that discourserelations that seem to cause a larger contextupdate are marked by less ambiguous connec-tives than relations for which less informationneeds to be conveyed in order to be inferred.This is in line with the UID and the conti-nuity and causality-by-default hypotheses putforth by Murray (1997) and Sanders (2005).The second study then went on to show thatone can distinguish several types of ambiguityamong discourse relations, in particular, morethan one relation can hold between two propo-sitions, and there are some connectives whichexpress this inherent ambiguity.
In the thirdstudy, we also showed that the effect of par-ticular discourse markers varies with respectto their contribution in different levels of re-lation classification.
Some connectives such asthe majority of the adversative ones, simplyhelp to distinguish contrastive relations fromother classes, while those with a temporal di-rectionality contribute most in the deeper levelof the PDTB hierarchical classification.
Theenhancement measure introduced in this pa-per can be employed for measuring the effectof any discriminative feature through the hi-erarchical classification of the relations.
Thiswork is a first step towards the computationalmodeling of the discourse processing with re-spect to the linguistic markers of the abstractdiscourse relations.
In future work, we wouldlike to look at the contribution of differenttypes of relational markers including sentenceconnectives, sentiment words, implicit causal-ity verbs, negation markers, event modals etc.,which in the laboratory setup have proven toaffect the expectation of the readers aboutan upcoming discourse relation (Kehler et al2008; Webber, 2013).91ReferencesAsher, N. and Lascarides, A.
