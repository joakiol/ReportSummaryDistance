We definethe relationship between the linguisticstructures of the source and target languagesin terms of a set of correspondence functionsinstead of providing derivational or proceduraltechniques for converting source into target.This approach permits the mapping betweensource and target to depend on informationfrom various levels of linguistic abstractionwhile still preserving the modularity oflinguistic omponents and of source and targetgrammars and lexicons.
Our conceptualframework depends on notions of structure,structural description, and structuralcorrespondence.
In the following sections weoutline these basic notions and show how theycan be used to deal with certain interestingtranslation problems in a simple andstraightforward way.
In its emphasis ondescription-based techniques, our approachshares some fundamental features with theone proposed by Kay (1984), but we use anexplicit projection mechanism to separate outand organize the intra- and inter-languagecomponents.Most existing translation systems are eithertransfer-based or interlingua-based.Transfer-based systems usually specify asingle level of representation r abstraction atwhich transfer is supposed to take place.
Asource string is analyzed into a structure atthat level of representation, a transferprogram then converts this into a targetstructure at the same level, and the targetstring is then generated from this structure.Interlingua-based systems on the other handrequire that a source string has to be analyzedinto a structure that is identical to a structurefrom which a target string has to be generated.Without further constraints, each of theseapproaches could in principle be successful, Aninterlingual representation could be devised,for example, to contain whatever informationis needed to make all the appropriatedistinctions for all the sentences in all thelanguages under consideration.
Similarly, atransfer structure could be arbitrarilyconfigured to allow for the contrastive analysisof any two particular languages.
It seemsunlikely that systems based on such anundisciplined arrangement of information willever succeed in practice.
Indeed, mosttranslation researchers have based theirsystems on representations that have somemore general and independent motivation.The levels of traditional inguistic analysis{phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics,discourse, etc.)
are attractive because theyprovide structures with well-defined andcoherent properties, but a single one of these- 272 -levels does not contain all the informationneeded for adequate translation.
TheD-structure level of Government-Bindingtheory, for example, contains informationabout the predicate-argument relations of aclause but says nothing about the surfaceconstituent order that is necessary toaccurately distinguish between old and newinformation or topic and comment.
As anotherexample, the functional structures ofLexical-Functional Grammar  do not containthe ordering information necessary todetermine the scope of quantifiers or otheroperators.Our proposal, as it is set forth below, allowsus to state simultaneous correspondencesbetween several levels of source-targetrepresentations, and  thus is neitherinterlingual nor transfer-based.
We canachieve modularity of linguistic specifications,by not requiring conceptually different kinds oflinguistic information to be combined into asingle structure.
Yet that diverse informationis still accessible to determine the set of targetstrings that adequately translate a sourcestring.
We also achieve modularity of a morebasic sort: our correspondence mechanismpermits contrastive transfer ules that dependon but do not duplicate the specifications ofindependently motivated grammars of thesource and target languages (Isabelle andMacklovitch, 1986; Netter and Wedekind,1986).A GENERAL ARCHITECTURE FORLINGUISTIC DESCRIPTIONSOur approach uses the equality- anddescription-based mechanisms ofLexical-Functional Grammar.
As introducedby Kaplan and Bresnan (1982),lexical-functional grammar assigns to everysentence two levels of syntactic representation,a constituent structure (c-structure) and afunctional structure (f-structure).
Thesestructures are of different formal types--thec-structure is a phrase-structure t e while thef-structure is a hierarchical finitefunction--and they characterize differentaspects of the information carried by thesentence.
The c-structure represents theordered arrangement of words and phrases inthe sentence while the f-structure xplicitlymarks its grammatical functions (subject,object, etc.).
For each type of structure there isa special notation or description-language inwhich the properties of desirable instances ofthat type can be specified.
Constituentstructures are described by standardcontext-free rule notation (augmented with avariety of abbreviatory devices that do notchange its generative power), whilef-structures are described by Booleancombinations of function-argument equalitiesstated over variables that denote thestructures of interest.
Kaplan and Bresnanassumed a correspondence function mappingbetween the nodes in the c-structure of asentence and the units of its f-structure, andused that piecewise function to produce adescription of the f-structure (in its equationallanguage) by virtue of the mother-daughter,order, and category relations of the c-structure.The formal picture developed by Kaplan andBresnan, as clarified in Kaplan (1987), isillustrated in the following structures forsentence (1):(I) (a) The baby fell.
(b)?rtl r~ I ~  ~'~RED ' fall<\[baby\],' 7/ ~ \  \ ITENSE past /\ ~\[ \[ \[NUMB sg I I/ I /2~ PEC RED thThe c-structure appears on the left, thef-structure on the right.
The c-structure-to-f-structure correspondence, ~b,is shown bythe linking lines.
The correspondence ?
is amany-to-one function taking the S, VP and Vnodes all into the same outermost unit of thef-stucture, fl.The node-configuration at the top of the treesatisfies the statement S~NP VP in thecontext-free description language for thec-structure.
As suggested by Kaplan (1987},this is a simple way of defining a collection ofmore specific properties of the tree, such as thefact that the S node (labeled nl) is the motherof the NP node (n2).
These facts could also bewritten in equational form as M(n2)=nl,- 273 -where M denotes the function that takes atree-node into its mother.
Similarly, theoutermost f-structure satisfies the assertions(/'1 TENSE) = past, (fl SUBJ) = f2, and(f2 NUMB)=Sg in the f-structure descriptionlanguage.
Given the illustratedcorrespondence, we also know that fl=d~(nl)and f2--~b(n2).
Taking all these propositionstogether, we can infer first that(dl)(n 1) SUBJ) = (l)(n2) and then that(dl)(M(n2)) SUB,/) = ~b(n2).
This equationidentifies the subject in the f-structure interms of the mother-daughter r lation in thetree.In LFG the f-structure assigned to a sentenceis the smallest one that satisfies theconjunction of equations in its functionaldescription.
The functional description isdetermined from the trees that the c-structuregrammar provides for the string by a simplematching process.
A given tree is analyzedwith respect to the c-structure rules to identifyparticular nodes of interest.
Equations aboutthe f-structure corresponding to those nodes(via ~b) are then derived by substituting thosenodes into equation-patterns or schemata.Thus, still following Kaplan (1987), if *appears in a schema to stand for the nodematching a given rule-category, the functionaldescription will include an equation containingthat node (or an expression such as n2 thatdesignates it) instead of *.
The equation(~(M(n2)) SUBJ)----~b(n2) that we inferred abovealso results from instantiating the schema(di)(M(*)) SUBJ)=?
(*) annotated to the NPelement of the S rule in (2a) when thatrule-element is matched against the tree in(lb).
Kaplan observes that the ?
andmetavariables in the Kaplan/Bresnanformulation of LFG are simply convenientabbreviations for the complex expressions~b(M(*)) and ~(*), respectively, thus explicatingthe traditional, more palatable formulation in(2b).
(2) (a) S--* NP VP?
(M(*)) SUBJ) = dl)(*) dl)(M(*)) = ~b(*)(b) S -4 NP  VP(1' SUBJ)= t =This basic conception of descriptions andcorrespondences has been extended in severalways.
First, this framework has beengeneralized to additional kinds of structuresthat represent other subsystems of linguisticinformation (Kaplan, 1987; Halvorsen, 1988).These structures can be related by newcorrespondences that permit appropriatedescriptions of more abstract structures to beproduced.
Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988), forexample, discuss a level of semantic structurethat encodes predicate-argument relations andquantifier scope, information that does notenter into the kinds of syntacticgeneralizations that the f-structure supports.They point out how the semantic structure canbe set in correspondence with both c-structureand f-structure units by means of relatedmappings o and o'.
Kaplan (1987) raises thepossibility of further distinct structures andcorrespondences to represent anaphoricdependencies, discourse properties ofsentences, and other projections of the samestring.Second, Kaplan (1988) and Halvorsen andKaplan (1988) discuss other methods forderiving the descriptions necessary todetermine these abstract structures.
Thearrangement outlined above, in which thedescription of one kind of structure (thef-structure) is derived by analyzing ormatching against another one, is an example ofwhat is called description-by-analysis.
Thesemantic interpretation mechanisms proposedby Halvorsen (1983) and Reyle (1988) are otherexamples of this descriptive technique.
In thismethod the grammar provides generalpatterns to compare against a given structureand these are then instantiated if the analysisis satisfactory.
One consequence of thisapproach is that the structure in the range ofthe correspondence, the one whose descriptionis being developed, can only have propertiesthat are derived from information explicitlyidentified in the domain structure.Another description mechanism is possiblewhen three or more structures are relatedthrough correspondences.
Suppose thec-structure and f-structure are related by ?
asin (2a) and that the function o then maps thef-structure units into corresponding units ofsemantic structure of the sort suggested byFenstad et al (1987).
The formal arrangementis shown in Figure 1 (next page).
Thisconfiguration of cascaded correspondencesopens up a new descriptive possibility.
If o and~b are both structural correspondences, then sois their composition o o ~b.
Thus, even thoughthe units of the semantic structure corresponddirectly only to the units of the f-structure andhave no immediate connection to the nodes of- 274-SNP VPI I !The baby f I I@IRED ' fa l l<\ [baby\ ]>'ENSE past 'baby'/z~PEC r~EF ? "

Forexample, the lexical entry for fall might begiven as follows:(3) fall V ( ~' PRED) -- 'fall 'lol REL) = fallARGI) -- O( ~ SUBJ)Descriptions formulated by composingseparate correspondences have a surprisingcharacteristic: they allow the final rangestructure (e.g.
the semantic structure) to haveproperties that cannot be inferred from anyinformation present in the intermediate (f-)structure.
But those properties can obtain onlyif the intermediate structure is derived from aninitial (c-) structure with certain features.
Forexample, Kaplan and Maxwell (1988a) exploitthis capability to describe semantic structuresfor coordinate constructions which necessarilycontain the logical conjunction appropriate tothe string even though there is no reasonableplace for that conjunction to be marked in thef-structure.
In sum, this method of description,which has been called codescription, permitsinformation from a variety of different levels toconstrain a particular structure, even thoughthere are no direct correspondences linkingthem together.
It provides for modularity ofbasic relationships while allowing certainnecessary restrictions to have their influence.The descriptive architecture of LFG asextended by Kaplan and Halvorsen providesfor multiple levels of structure to be related byseparate correspondences, and thesecorrespondences allow descriptions of thevarious structures to be constructed, either byanalysis or composition, from the properties ofother structures.
Earlier researchers haveapplied these mechanisms to the linguisticstructures for sentences in a single language.In this paper, we extend this system one stepfurther: we introduce correspondencesbetween structures for sentences in differentlanguages that stand in a translation relationto one another.
The description of the targetlanguage structures are derived via analysisand codescription from the source languagestructures, by virtue of additional annotationsin c-structure rules and lexical entries.
Thosedescriptions are solved to find satisfyingsolutions, and these solutions are then theinput to the target generation process.In the two language arrangement sketchedbelow, we introduce the ~ correspondence tomap between the f-structure units of the sourcelanguage and the f-structure units of the targetlanguage.
The o correspondence maps from thef-structure of each language to its owncorresponding semantic structure, and asecond transfer correspondence z' relates thosestructures.- 275 -(4)Source ," ", Targets ?O----------~O semantic structure o/O ~-- .
~  >O f-structured~/  ~ ~:-st ructureO OThis arrangement allows us to describe thetarget f-structure by composing dp and ~ to formexpressions such as z(dpM* COMP)= (~bM*XCOMP) or simply ~( ~ COMP)-- (~ ~ XCOMP)).This maps a COMP in the source f-structure intoan XCOMP in the target f-structure.
Therelations asserted by this equation are depictedin the following source-target diagram:(5)Source Target,Io::As another example, the equationZ'(O~ ARG1)=(O'~ ARG1) identifies the firstarguments in the source and target semanticstructures.
The equation ~'o( I' SUBJ)--o(z t TOPIC) imposes the constraint that thesemantics of the source SUBJ will translate via~' into the semantics of the target TOPIC butgives no further information about what thosesemantic structures actually contain.Our general correspondence architecturethus applies naturally to the problem oftranslation.
But there are constraints oncorrespondences specific to translation thatthis general architecture does not address.
Forinstance, the description of thetarget-language structures derived from thesource-language is incomplete.
The targetstructures may and usually will havegrammatical nd semantic features that arenot determined by the source.
It makes littlesense, for example, to include informationabout grammatical gender in the transferprocess if this feature is exhaustivelydetermined by the grammar of the targetlanguage.
We can formalize the relationbetween the information contained in thetransfer component and an adequatetranslation of the source sentence into a targetsentence as follows: for a target sentence to bean adequate translation of a given sourcesentence, it must be the case that a minimalstructure assigned to that sentence by thetarget grammar is subsumed by a minimalsolution to the transfer description.
Onedesirable consequence of this formalization isthat it permits two distinct arget strings for asource string whose meaning in the absence ofother information isvague but not ambiguous.Thus this conceptual and notationalframework provides a powerful and flexiblesystem for imposing constraints on the form ofa target sentence by relating them toinformation that appears at different levels ofsource-language abstraction.
This apparatusallows us to avoid many of the problemsencountered by more derivational,transformational or procedural models oftransfer.
We will illustrate our proposal withexamples that have posed challenges for someother approaches.EXAMPLESChanges in grammatical function.
Some quitetrivial changes in structure occur when thesource and the target predicate differ in thegrammatical functions that they subcategorizefor.
We will illustrate this with an example inwhich a German transitive verb is translatedwith an intransitive verb taking an obliquecomplement in French:(6) (a) Der Student beantwortet die Frage.
(b) L'6tudiant r6pond it la question.We treat the oblique preposition as a PRED thatitself takes an object.
Ignoring informationabout tense, the lexical entry for beantwortenin the German lexicon looks as follows:(7) beantworten V( T PRED)="oeantworten<( t SUBJ)( t OBJ)>'while the transfer lexicon for beantwortencontains the following mapping specifications:- 276-(?
I PRED FN) = r6pondre(8) (~ SUBJ)=~(TSUBJ)(~ { AOBJ OBJ) ---- ~( '1' OBJ)We use the special attribute FN to designate thefunction-name in semantic forms such as%eantworten < ( T SUBJ)( T OBJ) >'.
In thistransfer equation it identifies r~pondre as thecorresponding French predicate.
Thisspecification controls lexical selection in thetarget, for example, selecting the followingFrench lexical entry to be used in thetranslation:(9) rdpondre V( 1' PRED)='r6pondre<( 1`  SUBJ)( 1`  AOBJ)>'With these entries and the appropriate buttrivial entries for der Student and die Frage weget the following f-structure in the sourcelanguage and associated f-structure in thetarget language for the sentence in (10):(10)t~8PREDTENSESUBJDBJ'beantworten<\[Student\],\[Frage\]>presentI RED 'Student' 1 UMB sg END masc /f81LeREO dedJ f21~Pe c ~eF * 71I RED 'Frage' 1 UMB sg END fem /f82 \[PRED dieJJ f56~Pe c reEF + qlPRED ' r~pond re<\[6tudiant\] ,  \[a\]> ?TENSE present~RED '~tudiant r\]IGEND MASC /SUBJ I NUMB sgw- +l I ?

"~58 "C83The second structure is the f-structure thegrammar  of French assigns to the sentence in(6b).
This f-structure is the input for thegeneration process.
Other examples of thiskind are pairs like like and plaire and help andheIfen.In the previous example the effects of thechange in grammatical function between thesource and the target language are purelylocal.
In other cases there is a non-localdependency between the subcategorizing verband a dislocated phrase.
This is illustrated bythe relative clause in (11):(II) (a)...der Brief, den der Student zubeantworten scheint.
(b) ...la lettre, ~ laquelle l'~tudiantsemble r~pondre....the letter, that the student seemedto answer.The within-clause functions of the relativizedphrases in the source and target language aredetermined by predicates which may bearbitrarily deeply embedded, but therelativized phrase in the target language mustcorrespond to the one in the source language.Let us assume that relative clauses can beanalyzed by the following slightly simplifiedphrase structure rules, making use offunctional uncertainty (see Kaplan andMaxwell 1988b for a technical discussion offunctional uncertainty) to capture thenon-local dependency of the relativized phrase(equations on the head NP are ignored):(12) NP  ~ NP  S'( I' RELADJ)=S t .
.~ XP S(1' REL-TOPIC) = J, 1' = ~,( 1`  XCOMP* GF) = ~,We can achieve the desired correspondencebetween the source and the target byaugmenting the first rule with the followingtransfer equations:(13) NP  --* NP  S !
( 1`  RELADJ) =?
~( 1`  RELADJ) = (z i' RELADJ)z( ~ REL-TOPIC)ffi (~ ~ REL-TOPIC)The effect of this rule is that the ~ value of therelativized phrase (REL-TOPIC) in the sourcelanguage is identified with the relativizedphrase in the target language.
However, thesource REL-TOPIC is also identified with awithin-clause function, say OBJ, by theuncertainty equation in (12).
Lexical transferrules such as the one given in (8)independently establish the correspondence- 277  -between source and target within-clausefunctions.
Thus, the target within-clausefunction will be identified with the targetrelativized phrase.
This necessary relation isaccomplished by lexically and structurallybased transfer rules that do not make referenceto each other.Differences in control.
A slightly more complexbut similar case arises when the infinitivalcomplement of a raising verb is translated intoa finite clause, as in the following:(14) (a) The student is likely to work.
(b) I1 est probable que l'6tudianttravaillera.In this case the necessary information isdistributed in the following way over thesource, target, and transfer lexicons as shownin Figure 2.Here the transfer projection buildsup an underspecified target structure, to whichthe information given in the entry of probableis added in the process of generation.
Ignoringthe contribution of is, the f-structure for theEnglish sentence identifies the non-thematicSUBJ of likely with the thematic SUBJ of work asfollows:~8(15)~RED 'likely<\[work\]>\[student\] rpRED 'studentq~UMB sgSUBJ flg~ PEc mEF + 3L  #8~REO theJJ "~pRED 'work<\[student\]>~lXCOMP f4e~USJ \ [ tg :s tudent \ ] /  JThe corresponding French structure in (16)contains an expletive SUBJ, il, for probable andan overtly expressed SUBJ for travaiUer.
Thelatter is introduced by the transfer entry forwork:(16)1;48~REDSUBJCOMP"1;46'probable<\[46:travailler\]>\[il\]'EORM iD~RED 'travailler<\[19:6tudiant\]>COMPL que~RED '6tudiant~END MASCSUBJ ~UMB sg~19~PE c~ ~EF +7 ~68~RED 1~Again this f-structure satisfies the transferdescription and is also assigned by the Frenchgrammar to the target sentence.The use of multiple projections.
There is onedetail about the example in (14) that needsfurther discussion.
Simplifying matterssomewhat, there is a requirement that thetemporal reference point of the complementhas to follow the temporal reference point ofthe clause containing likely, if the embeddedverb is a process verb.
Basically the sametemporal relations have to hold in French withprobable.
The way this is realized will dependon what the tense of probable is, which in turnis determined by the discourse up to that point.A sentence similar to the one given in (13a) butappearing in a narrative in the past wouldtranslate as the following:likely A( 1' PRED) = ' l ike ly<(  1' XCOMP)>( 1' SUBJ)'( 1` SUB J) = ( 1` XCOMP SUB J)probable A( 1  `PRED) = 'probab le<(  1  `COUP)>( 1' SUB J)'( 1' SUBJ FORM) = il( 1' COUP COUPE) = que( 1' COUP TENSE) = future(?1' PRED FN)=probable(~t COMP)=Z(1 ' XEOMP)Figure 2- 278  -(17) I1 6tait probable que l'dtudianttravaillerait.In the general case the choice of a French tensedoes not depend on the tense of the Englishsentence alone but is also determined byinformation that is not part of the f-structureitself.
We postulate another projection, thetemporal structure, reached from thef-structure through the correspondence X (fromXpOVZKOS, temporal).
It is not possible todiscuss here the specific characteristics of sucha structure.
The only thing that we want toexpress is the constraint that the event in theembedded clause follows the event in the mainclause.
We assume that the temporal structurecontains the following information forlikely-to-V, as suggested by Fenstad et al(1987):(18) likely V(X ?
COND REL) =precede(X?
COND ARGI)=(X?
IND)(X ~ COND ARG2 ID)= IND-LOC2This is meant to indicate that the temporalreference point of the event denoted by theembedded verb extends after the temporalreference point of the main event.
The time ofthe main event is in part determined by thetense of the verb be, which we ignore here.
Theonly point we want to make is that aspects ofthese different projections can be specified indifferent parts of the grammar.
We assumethat French and English have the sametemporal structure but that in the context oflikely it is realized in a different way.
This canbe expressed by the following equation:(19) X 1' = X'z I'Here the identity between X and X-~ provides aninterlingua-like approach to this particularsubpart of the relation between the twolanguages.
This is diagrammed in Figure 3.Allowing these different projections tosimultaneously determine the surfacestructure seems at first blush to complicate thecomputational problem of generation, but amoment of reflection will show that that is notnecessarily so.
Although we have split up thedifferent equations among several projectionsfor conceptual clarity, computationally we canconsider them to define one big attribute valuestructure with X and z as special attributes, sothe generation problem in this frameworkreduces to the problem of generating fromattribute-value structures which are formallyof the same type as f-structures (see Halvorsenand Kaplan (1988), Wedekind (1988), andMomma and D6rre (1987) for discussion).Differences in embedding.
The potential of thesystem can also be illustrated with a case inwhich we find one more level of embedding inone language than we find in the other.
This isgenerally the case if a modifier-head relationin the source language is reversed in the targetstructure.
One such example is the relationbetween the sentences in (20):(20) (a) The baby just fell.

Thetarget structures corresponding to the variousf-structures are also not required to beintegrated.
These target f-structures can thenbe set in correspondence with any nodes of thetarget c-structure, subject o the constraintsimposed by the target grammar.
In this case,the fact that venir takes an XCOMP whichcorresponds to the ARG of just means that thetarget f-structure mapped from the ADV'sf-structure will be associated with the highestnode of the target c-structure.

The advantages anddisadvantages of these different approacheswill be investigated further in Netter andWedekind (forthcoming).CONCLUSIONWe have sketched and illustrated an approachto machine translation that exploits thepotential of simultaneous correspondencesbetween different levels of linguisticrepresentation.
This is made possible by theequality and description based mechanisms ofLFG.
This approach relies mainly oncodescription, and thus it is different fromother aFG-based approaches that use a- 280-description-by-analysis mechanism to relatethe f-structure of a source language to thef-structure of a target language (see forexample Kudo and Nomura, 1986).
Ourproposal allows for partial specifications andmulti-level transfer.
In that sense it alsodiffers from strategies pursued for example inthe Eurotra project (Arnold and des Tombe,1987), where transfer is based on one level ofrepresentation obtained by transforming thesurface structure in successive steps.We see it as one of the main advantages ofour approach that it allows us to expresscorrespondences between separate pieces oflinguistically motivated representations andin this way allows the translator to exploit thelinguistic descriptions of source and targetlanguage in a more direct way than is usuallyproposed.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThanks to P.-K.
