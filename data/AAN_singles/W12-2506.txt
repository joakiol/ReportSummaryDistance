Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Literature, pages 45?53,Montre?al, Canada, June 8, 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsFunction Words for Chinese Authorship AttributionBei YuSchool of Information StudiesSyracuse Universitybyu@syr.eduAbstractThis study explores the use of functionwords for authorship attribution in modernChinese (C-FWAA).
This study consists ofthree tasks: (1) examine the C-FWAAeffectiveness in three genres: novel, essay,and blog; (2) compare the strength offunction words as both genre andauthorship indicators, and explore  thegenre interference on C-FWAA; (3)examine whether C-FWAA is sensitive tothe time periods when the texts werewritten.1 IntroductionFunction words are an important feature set forAuthorship Attribution (hereafter ?AA?)
becausethey are considered topic-independent or context-free, and that they are largely used in anunconscious manner (Holmes, 1994; Stamatatos,2009; Koppel et al, 2009).
The Federalist Papers(Mostellar and Wallace, 1964) may be the mostfamous example of AA in English.
Mostellar andWallace (1964) conducted a detailed study ofsearching and testing function words to distinguishHamilton and Madison as the authors of thedisputed Federalist Papers.Although Function Word based AuthorshipAttribution (hereafter ?FWAA?)
has beensuccessful in many studies (Stamatatos, 2009),Juola (2008) argued that FWAA are mainlyapplied in English texts, and it may not beappropriate for other highly inflected languages,like Finnish and Turkish.
This may not be the casein that it is the content words, not the functionwords, that are inflected in those languages.However, function words are indeed rarely usedfor AA in non-English texts.
It was left out in thecomprehensive authorship analysis of The QuietDon (in Russian) by Kjetsaa et al (1984).
Theliterature review for this study found severalexamples of FWAA in Modern Greek (Mikros andArgiri, 2003) and Arabic (Abbasi and Chen, 2005).Overall, the effectiveness of FWAA has not beentested on many languages.Some studies on FWAA also reportednegative results.
Holmes (1994), in hiscomprehensive survey on authorship attribution,cited doubts given by (Damerau, 1975) and(Oakman, 1980),  and called for furtherinvestigation on the stability of function word usewithin an author?s work and between works by thesame author.Another problem for FWAA is to explainexactly what authorial characteristics are capturedby function words, since function words may alsocharacterize other textual properties like genre,author gender, and even topic, although functionwords are generally considered topic-independentor context-free (Stamatatos, 2009; Herring andPaolillo, 2006; Clement and Sharp 2003; Mikrosand Argiri, 2007).Clement and Sharp (2003) found that functionwords worked as well as content words inidentifying document topics.
Their furtherinvestigation showed that author and topic are notarbitrarily orthogonal to each other.
Using thesignificance level of two-way ANOVA test asmeasure, Mikros and Argiri (2007) found thatsome function words in Modern Greek candistinguish both topic and author, providing furtherevidence for possible topic-author correlationbased on function word dimensions.Function words are also used as indicators forauthor gender (Argamon et al, 2002; Koppel et al,2003) and text genre (Biber, 1993).
Koppel et al(2003) found gender preference on certain personal45pronouns and prepositions.
Herring and Paolillo(2006) repeated Argamon and Koppel?sexperiment by mixing genre and gender in the dataset, and discovered that the same gender indicatorsactually captured genre characteristics.In summary, related work has shown thatfunction words may contribute to distinguishingtopic, authorship, author gender, and genre.
Aquestion soon emerges: which dimension dofunction words characterize the most saliently?
Inother words, given a document set of mixed author,topic, and genre, would they interfere with eachother in classification tasks?
Answer to thisquestion would help guide experiment design forAA tasks, and explain the real authorialcharacteristics captured by function words.This paper aims to study the use of functionwords for Chinese authorship attribution (C-FWAA), since FWAA has not been well-studied inChinese.
Existing studies of C-FWAA are limitedto the analysis of famous authorship dispute caseslike whether Gao E or Cao Xueqin wrote the last40 chapters of the Dream of the Red Chamber, andno consensus was reached among these C-FWAAstudies (Zeng and Zhu, 2006).
Therefore nobaseline was available yet for general-purpose C-FWAA studies.This study consists of three tasks.
First,examine the effectiveness of C-FWAA in threegenres of creative writing: novel, essay, and blog.Second, compare the strength of function words asboth genre and authorship indicators, and explorethe genre interference on C-FWAA.
Third,examine whether C-FWAA is sensitive to the timeperiods when the texts were written.The third task is proposed for a unique reasonthat the influence of ancient Chinese (???)
onmodern Chinese (??? )
may affect functionword use.
For example, ?also?
corresponds to ??
?in ancient Chinese, and ???
in modern Chinese.???
(??s?
or ?of?
), ???
(?-ly?
), and ???
(?so?
)are only used in modern Chinese.
The governmentof Republic of China (RoC, 1912-1949) and thegovernment of People?s Republic of China (PRC,1949- ) both made changes to the Chineselanguage.
Hence the hypothesis is that Chinesefunction word use may also reflect the time periodof literary works.2 Experiment set up2.1 Constructing Chinese function word listVarious function word lists have been used in AAtasks in English, and the selection process usuallyfollows arbitrary criteria (Stamatatos, 2009).
Toconstruct the Chinese function word list, this studychose 300 most frequent characters from Jun Da?sModern Chinese Character Frequency List (Du,2005), removing the characters that contain solidmeaning, e.g.
???
(?to come?
), and removing allpersonal pronouns, e.g.
???
(?myself?)
in thatthey have been known as genre/register indicators(Biber, 1993).
This screening process resulted in35 function words (see Table 1).
Detailed Englishtranslation can be found in (Du, 2005).Every text document was then converted to avector of 35 dimensions, each corresponding toone function word.
The value for each dimensionis the corresponding function word?s number ofoccurrences per thousand words.?

Most AA studies use supervised learningmethods in that AA is a natural text categorizationproblem.
However, training data may not beavailable in many AA tasks, and unsupervisedlearning methods are particularly useful in suchcases.
In addition, this study aims to examine theclusters emerging from the data and explainwhether they represent authors, genres, or timeperiods.46This study uses Weka?s Simple EMalgorithm for all experiments.
This algorithm firstruns k-Means 10 times with different randomseeds, and then chooses the partition with minimalsquared error to start the expectation maximizationiteration.
Weka calculates the clustering accuracyas follows: after clustering the data, Wekadetermines the majority class in each cluster andprints a confusion matrix showing how manyerrors there would be if the clusters were usedinstead of the true class (Witten et al, 2011).2.3 Selecting writers and their worksTo exclude gender?s affect, all writers chosen inthis study are males.
Parallel analysis for femalewriters will be conducted in future work.Representative writers from three different timeperiods were selected to examine the relationshipbetween time period and function word use.
Thefirst time period (TP1) is the 1930-40s, whenmodern Chinese replaced ancient Chinese to be themain form of writing in China, and before the PRCwas founded.
The second time period (TP2) is the1980-90s, after the Cultural Revolution was over.The third time period (TP3) is the 2000s, when thepublishing business has been strongly affected bythe free-market economy.
Three representativewriters were chosen for each time period.
The timeperiod from the foundation of PRC (1949) to theend of the Cultural Revolution was excluded fromthis study because during that time most literaryworks were written under strong politicalguidelines.
Tables 2 and 3 listed the representativewriters and their selected works.
Two long novelsare separated into chapters in order to test whetherC-FWAA is able to assign all chapters in a book toone cluster.
Common English translations of thetitles are found through Google Search.
ChinesePin Yin was provided for hard-to-translate titles.All writers have to meet the requirements thattheir works cross at least two genres: fiction (novel)and non-fiction (essay).
The TP3 (2000s) writersshould have well-maintained blogs as well.Therefore this study will examine C-FWAAeffectiveness in three genres: novel, essay, andblog.All electronic copies of the selected works weredownloaded from online literature repositoriessuch as YiFan Public Library1 and TianYa Book2.1 URL http://www.shuku.net:8082/novels/cnovel.htmlTime period AuthorsTP1(1930-40s)???

The famousFederalist Papers data set was used as the test case.The Federalist Papers experiment was repeatedusing the function words provided in (Mostellarand Wallace, 1964).
The original FerderalistPapers and their author identifications weredownloaded from the Library of Congress website4.Function words were extracted using a Perl scriptand the word frequencies (per thousand words)were calculated.
The 85 essays consist of 51 byHamilton, 15 by Madison, 3 jointly by Hamilton2 URL http://www.tianyabook.com/3???
(Wang Zengqi) is an exception in that his writingcareer started in the 1930s but peaked in the 1980s.4 URL: http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fedpapers.html47and Madison, 5 by Jay, and 11 with disputedauthorship.
Mosteller and Wallace (1964)supported the opinion that Madison wrote all 11disputed essays, which is also the mainstreamopinion among historians.In the first round of experiment, Jay?s fiveessays and the three jointly-written ones wereexcluded, making the task easier.
The clusternumber was set to two.
EM returned results similarto that in (Mostellar and Wallace, 1964) byassigning all disputed papers to Madison (Table 4).However it did make several mistakes by assigning3 Hamilton?s essays to Madison and oneMadison?s essay to Hamilton, resulting in anoverall accuracy of (66-4)/66=94% in the not-disputed subset.C0 (Hamilton) C1 (Madison)Hamilton 48 3Madison 1 14Disputed 0 11Table 4: Hamilton vs. Madison (clusteringerrors in bold)In the second round Jay?s five essays wereadded to the test data.
The cluster number was thenchanged to three.
The EM algorithm successfullyattributed the essays to their real authors with onlyone error (assigning one Madison?s essay to Jay,see the confusion matrix in Table 5).
It alsoassigned all disputed essays to Madison.
The 3-author AA result in Table 4 seems even better thanthe 2-author AA result, but the difference is small.C 0 C1 C 2Hamilton 51 0 0Madison 0 14 1Jay 0 0 5Disputed 0 11 0Table 5: Hamilton vs. Madison vs. JayIn the third round the three jointly-writtenessays were added to the test data.
These jointly-written essays may resemble either Hamilton orMadison, which would result in 3 clusters still, orthey may exhibit a unique style and thus form anew cluster.
The test result shows that these threejointly-authored essays did confuse the algorithmno matter if the cluster number is set to three orfour.
When setting the cluster number to three(Table 6), all three joint essays were assigned toC2, which also attracted 11 Hamilton?s, 2Madison?s, 2 Jay?s, and 1 disputed essays.Increasing the cluster number to 4 does not reducethe confusion: Hamilton still dominated Cluster 0with 40 out of 51 essays in it; C1 is still dominatedby Madison (13 out of 15) and the disputed essays(9 out 11).
Jay?s essays were split into C1 and C2.This result actually shows that function words arehighly sensitive to noise like the jointly-writtenessays.C0 C1 C2H-M 0 0 3Hamilton 40 0 11Madison 0 13 2Jay 0 3 2disputed 1 9 1Table 6: impact of the jointly-written essays3.2 Chinese FWAA with genre and timeperiod controlledThis section describes the experiments and resultsfor task 1: evaluating the effectiveness of C-FWAA using EM and the 35 Chinese functionwords as features.
Controlling the time period andgenre, the same experiment was repeated for eachgenre and each TP.In the first round, the authors within each TPwere paired up in the novel genre to distinguishthem, which is expected to be easier thandistinguishing multiple authors.
The results inTable 7 show that the authors of TP1 and TP2novels are perfectly distinguishable, but those inTP3 are not.Compared to the writers of TP1 and TP2,writers in TP3 face a new market-driven economy.Writing-for-profit becomes acceptable and evennecessary for many writers.
TP3 writers like HanHan (HH) and Guo JingMing (GJM) obtained hugefinancial success from the publication market.Both of them also received doubts regarding theauthenticity of their works.Guo Jingming was found to plagiarize in hisbook Meng Li Hua Luo Zhi Duo Shao, which wasalso not assigned to his main cluster by C-FWAA.Guo JingMing founded a writing studio and hired48employees to publish and market his books.
Hepublicly admits the existence of ?group writing?practice in his studio because his name is usedmore as a brand than as an author.C-FWAA also encountered difficulty indistinguishing Han Han and Shi Kang?s novels.This finding is consistent with the fact that HanHan publicly acknowledged that his Xiang ShaoNian La Fei Chi mimicked Shi Kang?s style.
Sincethe beginning of 2012, a huge debate surged inChinese social media over whether Han Han?sbooks and blogs were ghost-penned by his fatherand others.
In this striking ?crowd-sourcingShelock Holmes?
movement, numerous doubtswere raised based on netizens?
amateur contentanalysis on contradicting statements in Han Han?spublic videos and different book versions.
Aseparate study is undergoing to analyze the stylisticsimilarity between Han Han and the candidatepens.As described in Section 3.1, FWAA is highlysensitive to noise like joint authorship.
This mayexplain the low performance of C-FWAA in TP3when plagiarism, group writing, and ghostwritingare involved.After C-FWAA on the novel genre, the sameexperiment was then repeated on the other twogenres: essay and blog.
The results in Table 7 showan average accuracy .87 for essays and .83 forblogs.
Overall, this round of experimentdemonstrates that C-FWAA is effective indistinguishing two authors in all genres and timeperiods.Author pair Novel Essay BlogTP1WZQ-SCW 1 .77SCW-QZS 1 .94WZQ-QZS 1 .81TP2WS-JPW 1 1.00WS-WXB 1 .96WXB-JPW 1 .85TP3GJM-HH .77 1GJM-SK .75 .65HH-SK .56 .84 .84TP2-3 HH-WS   .77SK-WS   .88avg  .90 .87 .83Table 7: pair-wise C-FWAAIn the second round C-FWAA was tested on thetask of distinguishing three authors, also startingfrom the novel genre and TP1.
In the 3-clusterresult (Table 8), C0 is devoted to SCW?s novel ??
(Border Town), a masterpiece in Chineseliterature, C1 captured all other SCW novels, andWZQ and QZS remain in C2 together.
WZQ andQZS were further separated after increasing thecluster number to four (with only two errors,highlighted in Table 8, of assigning QZS?s twoworks God?s Dream and the Foreword of FortressBesieged to SCW).
Two long novels that areseparated into chapters are also successfullyassigned into same clusters except for theForeword of Fortress Besieged.The 3-author experiment was then repeated onTP2 and obtained 100% accurate results.The 3-author AA result for TP3 is similar to its2-author result: HH and SK remain in one cluster.When increasing the cluster number to 4, GJM stilldominated C0 and C1, but now HH and SK wereseparated into C2 and C3 respectively.The C-FWAA accuracy was then calculated bychoosing the better result from 3-cluster and 4-cluster experiments (Table 8).
Overall, C-FWAA isable to distinguish three authors in the novel genreeffectively.30s-40scluster num = 3 cluster num = 4C0 C1 C2 C0 C1 C2 C3SCW 7 4 0 7 4 0 0WZQ 0 0 5 0 0 5 0QZS 0 0 14 0 2 0 122000s cluster num = 3 cluster num = 4C0 C1 C2 C0 C1 C2 C3GJM 4 3 1 4 3 1 0HH 1 0 4 1 0 3 1SK 0 1 3 0 1 0 3TP AccuracyTP1 28/30=.93TP2 11/11=1.00TP3 13/17=.76Avg .90Table 8: 3-author C-FWAA on Chinese novelsThe above experiment was then repeated on theessay and blog genres.

One possible explanation isthat novels are the longest, essays are shorter, andblogs are the shortest.
Hence novels provide thelargest amount of data for precise measure ofauthorial characteristics.
Further examination isneeded to test this hypothesis.
Another possibleexplanation is that blogs pose less constraint on thewriters with regard to the writing format, and thuswriters may write in much freer and more informalstyle.
Overall, C-FWAA reached over 80%accuracy in distinguishing two or three authors inall three genres.
This concludes the task #1.3.3 Function words as genre indicators withauthor and time period controlledThis section reports a series of experiments thataim to evaluate the effectiveness of function wordsas genre indicators and the genre interference onC-FWAA.
The first round of experiment examineswhether the function words can distinguish novelsfrom essays in each TP.
The cluster number wasset to two and the clustering result was comparedagainst the genre labels.
The error analysis alsoreveals which genre is less cohesive (failing tohold all of its instances in one cluster).TP Author Accuracy Which genre is lesscohesive?TP1WZQ .73 Essay (3->novel)SCW .78 Essay (3->novel)QZS 1TP2JPW .54 Essay (7->novel)WS 1WXB .85 Essay (2->novel)TP3GJM .71 Novel (4->essay)HH .63 Both (5 essay->novel; 1novel->essay)SK .66 Essay (2->novel)avg .77Table 11: function words as genre indicator (novel vs.essay)The results in Table 11 show that the averageaccuracy (over 9 authors) is .77 to distinguish anauthor?s novels and essays, demonstrating thatfunction words are also strong genre indicators.For some authors QZS, WS, and WXB, theirnovels and essays are highly separable based onfunction word use.
Interestingly, for all writers,their novels hold together perfectly except for GJM,but the essays often spread across two clusters.Again, the explanation may still be that novels arelonger than essays, and thus provide more precisestyle estimation.
If so, novels and essays may notbe a fair comparison.
However, the lengths ofessays and blogs are similar.
Therefore, the aboveexperiment was repeated to distinguish essays andblogs from same authors.
The results in Table 12show that this task is not easier.
The averageaccuracy is .71, which is a little worse than .77 indistinguishing novels and essays.
Once again, onegenre, this time it is the essay, that hold togethervery well, and blogs spread across clusters.50Combining the results in Section 3.2 and thissection, we can see that function words areindicators of both authorship and genre, and the C-FWAA performance is affected by genre: it is theeasiest for novel, then essay, and hardest for blogs.Author Acc #E->B #B->EWS .80 0/16   9/30HH .56 0/11 58/92SK .78 5/14   5/31Avg .71 .12 .36Table 12: function words as genre indicator(essay vs. blog)3.4 Which one do function wordscharacterize more saliently, genre orauthorship?In the experiments reported in this section TP wasstill controlled, but in each TP the three authorsand two genres are mixed together.
The experimentwas repeated for each TP.
Each experimentconsists of two steps.
First, the cluster number wasset to two, and the clustering result was comparedagainst the genre labels.
Second, the clusternumber was set to three, and the result wascompared against the author labels.
If genre playsstronger impact on function word use, we shouldsee high accuracy in the 2-cluster result, and ifauthorship is more salient, the 3-cluster resultshould be better.
The results show that for all threeTPs, the author-genre mix decreased theperformance of authorship clustering (column #3?AA in mixed genres?
vs. column #4 ?AA innovel?
and column #5 ?AA in essay?
), indicatingclear genre interference to authorship attribution.In comparison, the genre clustering in mixedauthors (column #1) was worse than genreclustering in single author (column #6) in TP1 only.In TP2 and TP3 genre clustering in mixed-authorsyielded higher accuracy than that in single-author,showing that mixing authors may increase ordecrease genre identification performance.To better understand the interference betweenauthorship and genre, the 3-cluster result for eachTP was visualized in Figures 1-3.
The clusters inTP1 (Figure 1) include authorship cluster C0(bottom row: SCW), genre cluster C2 (top: essay),and mixed cluster C1 (middle: WZQ, QZS, novels,and essays), demonstrating competing influence ofauthorship and genre on function words.
Theclusters in TP2 (Figure 2) are more genre-oriented,with C0 dominated by novels and C1 and C2 byessays.
The clusters in TP3 (Figure 3) are also asmixed as in TP1, but more authorship-oriented,with C0 dominated by Shi Kang, C1 by GuoJingMing, and C2 by Han Han.
In summary,function words characterize authors more salientlyin TP1 and TP3, and genres more saliently in TP2.Therefore, we conclude for task #2 that the level ofgenre interference on authorship attribution is notarbitrary but is actually dependent on individualdata set.2-genreclustering3-authorclusteringNovelAAEssayAAN-EgenreTP1 .51 .64 .93 .83 .84TP2 .89 .70 1.00 .89 .80TP3 .70 .75 .76 .84 .67Table 13: genre vs. authorshipFigure 1: mixing authorship and genre in TP1Figure 2: mixing authorship and genre in TP251Figure 3: mixing authorship and genre in TP33.5 Is C-FWAA dependent on time period?The task #3 is to examine whether C-FWAA isdependent on time period.
The hypothesis is thatwriters of different times may use the functionwords differently because of the drastic change inMandarin Chinese throughout the 20th century.When mixing the novels written in TP1, TP2, andTP3, the algorithm may be more sensitive to thetime period than individual authorship.
If thehypothesis is true, we should see the clusteringresult aligns with the time period, not authorship orgenre.
This time the cluster number is set to -1,which allows EM to use cross validation toautomatically determine the optimal number ofclusters (Smyth, 1996; McGregor et al, 2004).EM returns 4 clusters: C0 is dominated by QZS(1940s), C1 by WZQ, WS, and JPW (1980-90s),C2 by SCW (1930s) and WXB (1980-90s), C3 byGJM (2000s).
Therefore no obvious relationship isobserved between the clusters and the time periods.Further, all TP1 and TP2 writers share one thing incommon ?
their works stay in one cluster, but TP3writers?
works spread across multiple clusters:GJM 2, SK 3, and HH 4.
This result is consistentwith two facts that Han Han publiclyacknowledged that (1) his Xiang Shao Nian La FeiChi mimicked Shi Kang?s style, and (2) his SanChong Men mimicked Qian ZhongShu?s WeiCheng.Figure 4: clustering all novels from 9 authorsRepeating the experiment on essays resulted inonly two clusters.
Most writers?
essays remain inone cluster with few exceptions (e.g.
SCW, QZS,WXB and JPW in C0, and WZQ, WS and GJM inC1), while HH and SK?s essays spread across thetwo clusters.
The clusters do not seem to relate tothe time periods either.
What do these two clustersmean then?
An examination of the clusterassignment of HH?s essays reveals that his essaybooks Du, Jiu Zhe Yang Piao Lai Piao Qu, and KeAi De Hong Shui Meng Shou belong to C1, allwritten in casual and conversational style, and themore formal essays like Qiu Yi, Shu Dian, BeiZhong Kui Ren, and Yi Qi Chen Mo belong to C1.Interestingly, most essays in C1 are doubted to bepenned by his father.
This result suggests that theclustering result actually captured two sub-genresin essays.
However, further analysis is needed totest this hypothesis.
In summary, no solidrelationship was found between time period andChinese function word use.Figure 5: clustering all essays from 9 authors4 Conclusion and limitationsThis study made three contributions.
First, itexamined the effectiveness of using function wordsfor Chinese authorship attribution (C-FWAA) inthree different genres: novel, essay, and blog.Overall C-FWAA is able to distinguish threeauthors in each genre with various level of success.C-FWAA is the most effective in distinguishingauthors of novels (averaged accuracy 90%),followed by essay (85%), and blog is the hardest(68%).
Second, this study confirmed that Chinesefunction words are strong indicators of both genreand authorship.
When the data set mixed authorsand genres, these two factors may interfere witheach other, and in such cases it depends on the dataset which factor do function words characterizemore saliently.
Third, this study examined thehypothesized relationship between time period and52Chinese function word use in novels and essaysbetween 1930s and 2000s, but did not findevidence to support this hypothesis.This study has several limitations that need tobe improved in future work.
First, the data set issmall and not quite balanced.
More authors andworks will be added in the future.
Second, therandom seed for EM is set to the default value 100in Weka.
However, EM clustering result may varyto some extent with different random seeds.
Morerigorous design is needed for robust performancecomparison.
One design is to run each clusteringexperiment multiple times, each time with adifferent random seed.
The clustering accuracywill be averaged over all runs.
This new designwill allow for performance comparison based onpaired-sample t-test significance.
Third, theCultural Revolution time period is excluded fromthis study due to strong political influence onwriters.
One reviewer pointed out that this timeperiod should be valuable for examining therelationship between authorship, genre, and timeperiod.
Relevant data will be collected in futurestudy.5 AcknowledgmentSincere thanks to Peiyuan Sun for his assistance indata collection and the anonymous reviewers forthe insightful comments.ReferencesAhmed Abbasi & Hsinchun Chen.
