edu1 Description:This working session seeks to shed light on the relationship between structured lexicons and semantic tagging.We will address a number of fundamental questions, including:?
What are the different ypes of information that we want to tag??
How can information in a structured lexicon facilitate tagging tasks??
How long does it take to build a structured lexicon with the relevant pieces?
Can automatic proceduresbe used for the construction of lexical representations?
What existing resources should we be using andwhat aids do we have to transform these resources into appropriate r presentations??
What lexicai levels are required in a lexicon?
Syntactic?
Lexical semantic?
Aspectual?
Ontological?Deeper Knowledge?- What do the representations at each of these levels look like like, and how would they be con-structed?- What are the interdependencies between these levels?
Can we take advantage of interacting lin-guistic constraints from each level for the development of structured lexicons?
Should the levelsbe kept as separate layers and related explicitly or should they be combined into one layer and berelated implicitly?We will also address related questions, including:?
How much of what we can tag is context-dependent?
What tags can only be compositionaily derivedduring the corpus tagging process?2 FormatParticipants will be asked to respond to one or more of the issues above by March 20th.
Please use ascii,and send your responses by email to Mari Olsen, molsen~umiacs.umd.edu.
We will distribute participantresponses to all respondents by email.
We will select a facilitator for the most heavily addressed issues.During the session, we will break up into working groups, discuss the issues, and reconvene for a briefpresentation from each working group.93
