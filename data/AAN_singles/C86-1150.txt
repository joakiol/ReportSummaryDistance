The Eng!\[sh t_qMal_a~franslationSsSSSSSSSS_2~trmBaak~reusdComputer Aided T~anslation (CAT) research at UniversitiSa~m MalsysL~ (USM) began in 1976 as an individual researcheffcet.
However, at that time, the work is more appropriatelyclassified under hat, real language data ~cessing, includingtopics such as 'istilah' (temdnalogy) information retrieval,,Malay ~otf(~m extraction, parsing of Malay sentences usingcontext-free g~sn~s asd Malay language teaching tools \[Tong 78,Chang 78\].In 1978, research into CAT was initiated, and by 1979, theresearchers a~ U~4 began to develop g~mmmr medels for F~qglish toMalay translation using the software tool ~ \[GETA 78\].In 1980, a natior~l wc~kshop was conducted in USM, where apilot English to Malay tr~uslatlon system was desmnstrated.Financial sup~mt beckons available, and li~ther development onthe basic translation model was ca~ied out \[Tong 82, van Klinken84, zsharin 84\].In 1984, a per~nanent Computer-Aided-@ranslation Project unitwas set up at U~4, and full-time research staff were assigned tothis project.
Members of this project group now include t~ocomputer scientists, one linguist, and five lexicographer /edit~ / te~minologlst.
'\[his group was assigned the task ofproducing a labm, atory ~ototype for Englisll to Mal~translation, and the result of their efforts is presented in thisreport.S~stem Envlro~mentThe AK\[ANE system .is an integrated software environment forcemput er~alded-translat lon, including tools for compilinggrammes and dictionaries, and fer processing corpus of thesource and tm~et texts.
The CAT concepts beldnd this system iswell-known and weE-documented \[Boltet and Vauquols 1985\].This softwaPe has been prog~ammd using different levels ofcomputer Isngnmges, from IBM assembly (PL360) to PL/I, and makingextensive use of system tools of the IBM VM/CM~ ~stem - XEDITand EX~.
(~e of its advantages is efficiency (as cemDared toother similm, aystems), which means that it can execute withreasonable speed even on a combatively sa~ll computem system.USM's experience ~ith the ARIANE system ires been varysatisfactery, and we doubt very much .if another ~ystem cot~ld havebeen mdgrated asd utillsed at this University with similarsuccess.
Althou$~ theme lind been s~me criticisms about ARIANE inthe literature, our experience has sho~ that insplte of itsrecognised weaknesses and drawbacks, it remains an ext r~ lypowemgul and practical set of tools f~r the development of CATsystess.
Of course, the methodology pioneered at GETA \[Vanquois75\] has been incorF~mated into ninny 'new' systems today.On the physical side, the ARIAN~ system itself occnpiesabout 8 Mbyte of secondary storage, while the usem n~cldnerequiwes m\]othem 5 Mbyte for storing the linguistic data (grammarmodels and dictionaries, but not including the source and targettexts and their intermediate :~esults).
A vi~tlml m~movy size of2 Mbytes is used f~.
the execution of all the trasslations f~n~qglish to Malsy desc1~bed in this rep(mt.Translation Model and Executinn TimeThe ~%glish to Malay translation system consists of threemain dictionm,ies -source English, Engllsh-Malay transfer,target Malay - and i~Ive gr~mmr models.
The size of these variouscomponents are as follows:Dictior~ries:Sotu.ce lexieals: 5,000Target lexicals: 4,000Grssmar models:(11,0o0 w~de)( 9,000 w~de)lines rulesnDr~0hologIcal analysis 600 90s tructun~al analysis 5600 300structural transfer 800 47structural generation 1700 120marphuloglcs/ generation 900 120The executinn time for translation is estimated at 1.0097Mild (million of instructions per word).
This is consistent withtimes measured at GhTA, Grer~:)ble \[Boitet and VauqtDis 81~\].
Inprastlcal terms, tlda means that on U~4's I~4 4381 system(estimated at 2.1 MIPS), the.
translation time is approx~l~tely0.48 second of ~.h~tual CPU tJ,le per word.
This fignme is basedon the translation time for about 3,000 wn?ds taken i~n theselected text.
The Imoportionate time for each I~se of thetranalation r~ocess is as follows:percentmo~phologlcal analysis 0.33structural ~ma3.vsis 55.21lexical transfer 0.44structumal transfem 11.34stractural generation 31.47morphological generat ion 1.21From the above, it can be seen that the three dictionaryretrieval phases togethem account for only 2 % of the time, whilethe struct~.al ~m/ysis plmse, used up more titan half the totaltame, with the l~st taken up ~ the structural ganeration (aboutone-tldrd) and the structural tr~sfer phases.
%TLis result is639again consistent with those for other translatienmodels at GETA,Grenoble.2.
The Qualitz of TranslationGradin~ SchemeIn orde~ to assess the 'quality' of the translation output,a grading scheme (from grade A to grade F) was devised using asentence as the benndary of assessment.
This scheme is based onthe ease of posfi-edit~ig the translation output, and not on thequality ur standard of trsaslation in the inure usual sense.Currently, there is no estahlished method of evaluatingccrnputer-alded-trasslatlon or mechanical translation output.Fase of post-editlng is a measure which also takes into accountthe ease of understsnding as we\]/ as the accuracy of translation.Two impurtant fact,s which affect say grading scheme is thetypology of the source text itself asd the expert knowledge ofthe evaluatur in that particular area of text.
Some method ofevaluating the ease of undurstandlng of the source text and scmedefinition of a neutral evaluator are ~urequlsiten to shystasdardlsed evaluation scheme.%~le grading scheme proposed in this report is a measure ofthe time required to edit sentences translated by the cc~?outer,ranging 9tom fast (as in grade A where no pest-editing isreqtdred) to slow (as in grade F where a sentence has to beretranslated manually).
There has been no attempt to catag~misethe source sentences into different degrees of difficulty urlength.
Hence, the typology of text used in this evaluation mustbe burne in mind when assessing the overall results.
Althoughgrades are assigned to ~ndividual sentences, the source textswere extracted by paragraphs, and hence, the continuity of thetext is maintained.
The actual grading itself was carried out bymore th2m one individual in urder to reduce (as much as possible)the effect of individual 'bias'.
After careful scrutiny, it wasconcluded that variation in the results obtained is withinexpected limits, thus allowing broad conclusions to be drawn onthe effectlveness/usefkflness of the translation ~stem.The grades assigned to translated sentences are as follows:A: ~ect  translation, no modification required.B: list of alternative wurds selected by post-editur.C: understasdable translation (with preservation ofmeaning), single word correct lens without reference tosource text.D: as in C, but referencs to source text is necessary.E: major modifications with reference to source text.F: retrasslated menua~.Results for Selected Area and TextA C~lemistry textbook fcm upper secondary school was chosenas the first text for the development of the laberatem-yprototype.
A total of 393 sentences were extracted at rasdsnfrom this textbook and translated by the cemputer.
Thetranslation output is then graded by three htmen post-editors asdthe result given below is based on their ccmbimed evaluation.Grade: A B C D E FNo.

Most of the additionalproblems encountered can be solved either throu~l dictiossrycoding ur minor modiflcatiens in the grEmmmr.
With thesechanges, the qtm31ty of translation for the Computer Science textis expected to be raised to the sane level as that fur theChemistry text.3.
Emlstlr~ Problems ClassificationAn attempt was made to analyse the problems encountered,i.e.
the errurs in translation output.
This involves a tediousprocess of correctly identItyiog the source of each ereor foundin the trasslation output, and then classifying then according tothe phase of translation (i.e.
analysis, trassfur or generation)at which they occur.
The purpose is to identify simple problemswhich can be solved in the existing system through modificationsto the linguistic data, while more c~plex ~oblams can be thesubject of further research.
This analysis of errors &Isoprovides statistical infsrmation on their distribution andimportasce, hence giving some guidelines as to their priority forfur  thur investigation.The AnalXsis PhaseThe problems of a,bigui~ and coordination account for morethan l~qlf of the errors at the ~alyals plmse.
The probl~n of~m~iguity here refers to smbi~t ies  which remain unresolved atthe end of analysis and to cases of erroneous dls~nblguation.This type of problem is by far the most important, accounting furclose to 50 percent of the e~isting errors found in the anslysisphase.Ambiguities which remain unresolved includevurb/noun ( ' foam1', 'wurks' ,'use' ),verb/adjective ( 'direct', 'total' ),verb/yen ( ' .. is unglazed paper.. ' ),noun/adjective ( 'routine', 'plural' ),vemb/vlng ( '.. painting of...' ),adJ/pronoun ( 'other' ).laslCourdinatien (apposition, inclusion) is a serious structuz, alDroblem not Imndled particularly well by the existing gra,marmodel.
Many different types of elements can participate incoordination (apposition, inclusion) and exsmplss of cases notconsidered in the current grammar are:complex noun phrases,prepositions,V~'~.
l  clauses,interrogatives,adjunct phrases.

%~lesource of this problem is actlm33~ at the ~lalysls ~lase, whichwas unable to ~moduce a suPficiently deep level of intexTmetation(e.g.
se~sntics and sesmntie relations) to solve the ~bJ~uitywhich manifests itself only at trm\]sfer.The two categories of words which are most problematic arethe verbal :\['(X~llS ( '~eveal' , ' assa, e', ~ call ' ) and the~cepositians ( 'in' ,'by' ,'to').
Although dis~bi~uation rulesbased on context are ~s~loyed du~ the structural transferphase, they can only solve relatively st~a~tfca~ard cases.
Forthe more dlff:tcult eases, the current av~oach of displaying alist of multiple choices of words to the human post-editor seemsto be t/~e most acceptable solution.
Much deeper work in statesemantics and semantic relations will imve to be carried out into im~x)ve on this.
Even if such improvements are found,there is still tlle question of weighing the cost of suchsopldsticatod in~cessing by the cemputea" (which is expected to bevery high) a~nst  the cost of l~m~ post-editing.Id~o,mtic expressions are nc~ms/.ly coded directly in thesource dictio,~ry.

S~meidiomatic expr(~ssions are ambiguous (i.e.
they can be considex~didlc~atic only in cemtalu context), and hence, there is tlleproblem of (~samb~uat~\]g thCSl dlIvID.g ana\]$sis.
Also, scsleEnglish id i~t ic  6~pressions are particularly diCficult totrasslate into Malay, and perhaps other target l~%~mges as well.The Gene~ation PhaseEr~s  during structaral generation are relatively few, andalso relatively minor 9rc~ the point of view of post-editing.Most errors daxdng this phase will give rise to grade C sentencesif there are no other type of ~ s  in the sentence.The main ~obl~ns are as follows:** Podition of elements in cc~plex noun phrase.Most of the ex~o~s are dim to the incc~'ect placement of the~eposition 'b~\[J' (similar I.o 'of' but not as ccmnonly used) ina complex MaI~v noml pl)rase.
Other e\].6ments of the noun phrasewhich give rise to errors are the '-lag' or '-an' f~n used as ~adjective, sad tlle lexicals 'other' and 'only' which seemdifficult to tra~slate into Y~lay.
Very often, m~ adjective JnMalay is introduced by the relative pronoun 'yasg'.

Even when this isnot necessary, as in the case of a ~onoun referriog to anundefined abject, it may be incorrect to translate directly withthe equivalent ~.~noun ('ia', 'merely', 'yang lain', 'kita').Again further ~mvesti~ation into the linguistic aspects of thisproblem will be necessary ~fore  an acceptable solution can befound.source: 'move i~om one ~ of the solid to another'cemputem: 'bemgerak dari 1 ~ : ~  pepeJal kepada y_~ laln'edited: 'be, rgm,ak dar i  1 b~'~_____/pepeJal kepada ~ ~%\[~Kla in '4.

Unti lformal .linguistic work on semantics (such as Montagne G~ammr)can come up with same practlc~ solution, these problems are onlyamenable to a l~%flstic e r~nee~ ap~ach based on somestatic categnrisation of semantics together with some generaliseddynsmic method of processing and the ability to l~idleexceptional cases.The current Ea~lish analysis model a \ ] re2~ contains a very641cemprehensive set of dissmbiguation imles.
Fc~, the moredifficult cases which still r~dn unresolved at the end ofanalysis, exhaustive sea~chmethod can be employed.
This is notas costly as it imgy seem, since a survey of such cases hasindicated that good heu~istlc conditions mR possible to recklcethe overall search time.~he current ~Llysis model attempts to achieve a deep levelof interpretation right up to logical and semantic relations.Since tluts level rosy not be attainable for many of the sentencesin a particular text, a lower level of in t~etat ion  such assyntactic f~nctions ac even mo~phssyntactic classes should beused instead.
A large proportion of such sentences can still betranslated ccr~ectly, and there/c~e, the rmovlsion of this'safety net' is essential.The development of an industrial prototype will demmnd aconsiderable increase in the size of the dictionary, at least toabout 10,000 source lexlcal units.
Hence, lexicographlc workrepresents the single most important and tlme-cousumisg task inthe development of an imdustrial prototype.
Preparations arealresdy underway to si~llfy this task by li~)ducing a simplifiedfarm (or questiomaire) which can be filled-up by lexicographerswith perhaps only a minimal emount of t ra ln~.
Data frem this'form' can then be transferred into computer codes to be used bythe translation s~stem.This Ireporation of a cc~puteutsed dictionary can also beintegrated withanyworkbelng carried out on lexical databasesfor ordinary ~cmmn consumption.
The two tasks have a largeEm~xmt of intersect~nglnformation needs, and hence, can bemntuallybeneficial.Towards an Industrial P ro to t~The lab(matory l~rototype is now ready for development intoan industrial Imotot~pe.
%~ie first task is of course the drmvlngup of a list of possible applications, followed by a feasibilitystudy of the text typology for each of these application.
Thefins/ selection will be based on the quality of trans\]ation whichcan be expected and the type of financial support available.Other important considerations include:the volt~e of ImanBlation waek,the frequency of translation wQrk,the urgency / speed of the translation w~k,the availability of a ccmplete set of Malay technical terms,the availability of text matezdals in machlne-readableformat.Once an application Ires been selected, the next step is theonganlsation of the development %~rk itself.
Hare, the availablemanpower is a critical element, and from experience, it is verydifficult to convince policy makers and financial supporters onthis.
Any c~velopment teem must be made up of hlgh-callbrecomputational linguists, computer scientists, lexlcoguaphers,editors sud translators, who must be ~ll-tralned in them~thodology of ccmputor-alded-translation besides their own areaof specialisatlon.Another ~Tportant factor for planning purposes is the timereqtdmed to develop an Industrisl prototype, and this has alsobeen frequently underestimated.
It is estimated that at \].east 3years work by the existing research teem at Unlverslti SalesMals3,sla will be x~qui~ed to complete an industrial prototype for~4~lish - Mala~ translation in one specific area of application.A DedlcationWithout the late Professcm B.
