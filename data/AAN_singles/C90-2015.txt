L. DelinCentre for Cognitive Science2 Buccleuch PlaceEdinburghUnited KingdomEH8 9LWemail: judy@uk.ac.ed.cogsciPhone: +44 31 668 4515In t roduct ionThis pal~;r presents an analysis and synthesis of thefactors relevant to the decision to use a cleft construc-tion in discourse.
The model described, based on acorpus of 587 naturally-occurring cleft constructionsin written and spoken discourse, consists of twostages.
The first stage concerus the decision to use acleft construction rather than a non-cleft; the seconddescribes the factors relevant in deciding betweenthree types of cleft: it-clefts, such as that in example(1), wh-clefts, such as (2), m~d reverse wh-clefts, suchas (3):(1) It was the mango that Martin ate.
(2) What Martin ate was the mango.
(3) The mango was what Martin ate.Below, we examine some previous explanations ofthe functions of clefts in discourse, paying particularattention to the prevalent view that clefts of all kindsare 'focu,;ing' constructions.
Analysis of the corpusdata reveals that this view does not stand up to closescrutiny: a more complex model of cleft function isrequired, incorporating factors at more than onelevel of description, if the unique function of clefts asan option for speakers and writers is to be properlyunderstood.
"Iqae paper shows how factors at thelevels of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics interact,and sketches how these factors might be synthesisedin a decision procedure for generating cleft construc-tions in connected iscourse.
The work presentedhere appears in greater detail as a doctoral disserta-tion (Delin \[1989\]).As a terminological note, in what follows, the irrune-diate complement of the cleft copula be (the mango,in each of the cleft examples above) will be termedthroughout the cleft HEAD.
The clausal constituent(that Martin ate, or what Martin ate) in each case willbe termed the cleft COMPLEMENT.
The class of cleftconstructions in general will often be referred tosimply a,; CLEFTS; the use of other terms will bemade clear as and when they arise.Previous Explanations of Cleft FunctionIn the literature on cleft constructions todate, threeexplanations of the function of clefts have gainedcurrency.
These are as follows:Clefts provide a syntactic indication ofthe position of particular statuses of in-formation, such as 'Given" or "New';Clefts provide unique options for thepresentation of information in a particu-lar serial order; andClefts are 'focusing' constructions, indi-cating the position of information that is'salieng in the discourseA detailed analysis of 150 of each of the cleft types,taken from the Survey of English Usage spoken data(Svartvik and Quirk \[1980\]), however, reveals thatsignificant classes of counterexamples are availablefor all three explanations: the data is more variedthan is often thought.First of all, it can be demonstrated that clefts do notreliably indicate 'Given' and 'New' information inparticular syntactic positions in the sentence.
That is,clefts neither contain Given information in the com-plement and New in the head (which we can term theSTRONG version of this hypothesis, adopted byHornby \[1972\], Haviland and Clark \[1974\],Clark ndClark \[1977\] inter alia), nor do they divide Given fromNew information in other syntactic ways (as theWEAK version of the hypothesis suggests, adopted byPrince \[1978\], Geluykens \[1984\], Quirk et al\[1985\],and Cruttenden \[1986\] among others).Although definitions of 'Given' and 'New' informa-tion are not always easy to apply formally, it ispossible to obtain a formal approximation toHalli-day's \[1967\] intended notion by applying the follow-ing criteria:On the basis of a formal representation,New information is taken to be any argu-ment, predicate, or eventuality (state,1 83event or process, following Bach \[1986\])that appears explicitly in the representa ~tion of the sentence under analysis butnot in that of the context; andThe occurrence of a prosodic nucleus istaken to be corroborative evidence of thepresence of New information.The data showed, however, that neither the Strongnor the Weak hypothesis were upheld.
Counterex-amples to the strong version were clefts that con-tained one or more New elements in the comple-ment: 90% of/t-clefts, 92% of wh-clefts, and 100% ofreverse wh-clefts examined had this information ar-rangement.
The prevalence of such examples wasconfirmed by the fact that 41 it-clefts, 40 wh-clefts,and all of the reverse wh-clefts had one or morenuclear accents in the part of the sentence commonlythought o convey "Given' information.
The Weakversion of the hypothesis requires that Given infor-mation is segregated syntactically from New infor-mation in some sense.
Counterexamples to this ver-sion, however, were a large group of clefts that con-tained some New information i both head and com-plernent: 60% of it-clefts, 92% of wh-clefts, and 14% ofreverse wh-clefts.
Again, as corroborative evidence,prosodic nuclei appeared in both head and comple-ment of 25 it-clefts, 40 wh-clefts, and 4 reverse wh-clefts.The hypothesis that clefts provide unique options forthe presentation f information i a particular serialorder has been suggested by Chafe \[1976\], Werth\[1984\] and Geluykens \[1984\] among others.
How-ever, in the corpus examined it was frequently thecase that a cleft would be used in a context where thecorresponding declarative, assuming that such asentence were syntactically possible, would havegiven an identical serial ordering.
For example, thewh-cleft in (4a) does not offer significantly differentordering options from the declarative in(4b), yet thecleft was chosen (capital letters indicate the constitu-ent upon which a nuclear accent appears):(4) But I have no reason to believe he teacheslinguistics(a) ...what he teaches i modern LANGUAGES(b) ...he teaches modern LANGUAGESIn addition, there were sentence types other than de-claratives, uch as some instances of topicalisation,that allowed an information ordering the same asthat of a cleft o be achieved.
This means that serial or-dering options, while not irrelevant as a considera-tion iin clefting (as we shall see below), do not sufficeas an explanation of clefts as a group of construc-tions, since the ordering options provided are notunique to clefts.Finally, there exists in the literature a common as-sumption that clefts serve to 'focus' an elementappearing ina particular syntactic position, on somedefinition of the term.
Two particular definitions offocus can be taken as as examples: the computationalnotions of focus applied to cleft constn~ctions bySidner \[1979\] and Reichman \[1981, 198!5\] in theirwork on the resolution of pronominal naphora, ndthe sentence-accent related notions of focus sug-gested by Chafe \[ 1976\], Creider \[1979\] and Quirk et aI\[1985\] as explanations ofclefts.
Taking the computa-tional notions first, Sidner \[1979:60\] and Reichman\[1985:75\] predict hat some particular syntactic posi-tions in cleft constructions are more likely than oth-ers to denote the antecedent of a subsequent pro-nominal anaphor.
Sidner claims that he cleft is amonga group of sentence types that 'make the recognitionof focus easy, since \[they\]...have the purpose of sin-gling out one element from others', assuming thatthe 'singling out' function is performed by the head ofthe cleft; while Reichman builds into her algorithmthe principle that the cleft subject is assigned a "highfocus' rating.The corpus as a whole yielded 92 examples of ana-phors that were co-referential with an antecedentsomewhere in a cleft construction.
These antece-dents, however, did not appear in the predicted po-sitions more frequently than they did elsewhere.
Theexamples relevant o Sidner's prediction showedthat it-cleft heads provided antecedents on 43% ofthe total occasions, with wh-clefts more successful at78% and reverse wh-clefts much less so at 11%.
Reich-man's prediction was less successful still: cleft sub-jects acted as antecedents of subsequent pronouns in43% of/t-clefts, 22% of wh-clefts, and 11% of reversewh-clefts.
While it is not in question that Sidner's andReichman's algorithms do resolve anaphora, it is notclear that the assumption that a particular syntacticposition is more likely to denote a 'focus' is likely tohelp to resolve anaphors encountered in naturally-occurring data.Turning to the accent-related definitions of focus, itcan be demonstrated that the appearance ofaccentsdoes not correlate reliably with the particular syntac-tic positions predicted to bear 'focal' information.For example, Chafe and Creider suggest hat thehead constituent of any cleft is focal, focus beingmarked by a nuclear accent.
In my corpus, however,only 10% of it-clefts, 8% of wh-clefts, and no reversewh-clefts had a sole nucleus in this position.
For wh-clefts and it-clefts, a nucleus in both head and com-plement was frequent (cf.
examples (5) and (6) be-low), while in reverse wh-clefts the popular positionfor nuclei was in the complement alone, as in (7):(5) A: But have you got a kettleB: Well what I would USE is one of thoselittle solid FUEL jobs(6) A: Now where did I hear that fromB: Probaby me was it-it was the day AFTERwhen I RANG(7) We're big enough to stand on our owntwo feet now and this is what Vincentsaid NO about2 84Quirketal \[1985\] suggest that clefts will contain oneaccentually-marked focus in the head constituent,and one in the complement.
Although this is closer tothe patterns hown in (5) and (6) above, there are stillsignificant exceptions.
Only 50% of it-clefts and 8% ofreverse wh--clefts howed the required accent pat-tern, 'with wh-clefts more successful at 80%.It seems therefore that accent and s3n~tax do not cor-relate in the way that would be required to supportthe view that cleft constructions indicate the positionof an accentuaUy-marked focal element.
The assump-tion that such a correlation can be found can perhapsbe accounted for in terms of a past over-reliance ondecontextualised xamples, which tend to be readaloud with the default accentual pattern of a nucleusin head position and none elsewhere.
However, whenlooking at clefts in discourse, the assumption thatthere is a straightforward correlation between ac--cent, syntax, and the infm3nation status 'focus' is fartoo simple to explain the facts--the large literature onaccent placement in context (cf.
Gussenhoven \[1983\]inter alia) bears witness to this.
It is clear that, if afocusing explanantion is to be found at all for clefts,an alternative formulation of the notion is required.As a general observation, one of the most markedshortcomings of the putative xplanations of cleftconstvoctions examined above is their tendency toconsider only one level of description--usually thatof pragcnatics---in accounting for discourse function.It is plausible to suppose that, while clefts may wellbe differentiated from other sentence types at thelevel of pragmatics, their use in discourse is likely tobe influenced additionally by other factors~for ex-ample, the well-understood semantic fact that cleftsare presupposition-inducing Syntactic structures.
Inwhat follows, an alternative view will be presentedof how a range of factors at the levels of syntax,semantics, and pragmatics combine to carve out aniche for clefts in the range of sentential syntacticstructures available to speakers at any given point ina discourse.
The account of clefts will be formulatedin two stages: factors that differentiate clefts fromnon-cleft constructions, and factors that may plausi-bly serve to determine the choice between the threecleft types.Di f f~arent iat ing C le f ts  and  Non-C le f tsThe hmction of clefts as a class of construction can beexplained in terms of three factors, some of whichhave been observed before in relation to clefts, butnot integrated in a complete picture of their function.First, clefts of all kinds serve to indicate by means oftheir syntax the site of two statuses of propositionalcontent: PRESUPPOSITION and ASSERTION.
The view ofpresupposition adopted here is a seman tic one, wherepresupposition is syntactically induced by particularstructures.
The presupposition i duced by the cleftcontains an existentially-quantified variable, whosevalue is supplied by the asserted proposition.
Thevariable-containing presupposition is given as ex--pression P in the analysis of the cleft in example (8)below, while the assertion is ~ven as expression A.The notation is a linearised form of that used inDiscourse Representation Theory (cf.
Kamp \[1981\]),with the addition of eventuality indices as argu-ments standing for the events, states and processesdescribed by the cleft:(8) It was the mango that Martin ate.P: \[el, x, m\] ate(el, x, m)A: Is1, x, y\] be(s1, x, y) and mango(y)As suggested by van der Sandt \[1988\] the presuppo-sition serves the function in discourse of communi-cating to the hearer that a propositional ANTECEDENTneeds to be found or constructed for the presup-posed proposition.
Note that this view says nothingabout he actual state of the discourse context: itdoesnot suggest that the presupposed information has tobe available to the hearer already at the time ofencountering the presupposition.
It is therefore per-fectly coherent to suggest thai: New information ap?pears in the presupposed proposition: indeed, asseen above in the discussion of the information strucoture of clefts, this is commonly the case.
The appear?ante of New information in presupposed form hasbeen observed by Kartunnen \[1974:191\] and Stalnaker\[1974\] in relation to presuppositional constructionsin general.The secondfactor involved in differentiating cleftsand non-cleftsis that clefts convey the fact that the in-stantiation of the variable in the presupposition isUN1QUE or MAXIMAL with respect o the context.
Inthe case of (8), for example, there must be a unique setof objects currently in the discourse context such thatMartin ate them.
This is not a new observation (cf.
forexample Atlas and Levinson \[1981\]), but independ~ent mechanisms have always been advanced toexplain it.
In fact, the requirement that the elementdenoted by the cleft head must be the totality ofobjects currently in the discourse context able tosatisfy the variable is identical to a condition on theappropriate use of definite referring expressions-.also presupIx~sitional constructions, as noted byHawkins \[1978\].
For example, the phrase the bishopsmust not be used as a referring expressions if thereexists in the current context any element that satisfiesthe predicate bishop but is not intended to be in the setof referents specified by the phrase.
The same is trueof the cleft ca~: there must be no elements in thecurrent context that satisfy the predicateate hemangobut that are outside the (singleton) set specified byMartin.The third relevant factor in determining the functionof clefts is a pragmatic one, namely that the instanta-tion of the variable in the presupposition must beNOVEL.
As van der Sandt \[1988\]has pointed out,examples of the following kind are unacceptable inboth clefts and declaratives:(9) //John won and it was John who won.However, (10) is acceptable as a cleft:3 85(10) I knew someone won, and I saw John amoment ago, but I didn't know it wasJohn who won.The distinction between (9) and (10) is that, while theparticipants inthe event described by the cleft in eachcase, and the nature of that event, may already beavailable in the discourse, only in the second case isthe connection between the winning event and thewinner a novel one.
This connection, which can infact be characterised as that between the variable inthe presupposition and its instantiation, eeds to beinformative for the cleft to be acceptable.
An impor-tant part of the function of clefts in general appears tobe the highlighting of this connection.Having outlined the three factors determining thefunction of clefts as a class of construction, we canturn to ways of choosing between the three clefttypes.Choos ing  Between C le f tsThe factors contributing to the differentiation i be-tween the three cleft types are argued here to be asfollows:The three cleft types provide differentoptions for the serial ordering of infor-mation;Different constraints exist on the rela-I:ionships that can exist between the pre-supposed information borne by each cleft,and the discourse context;The clefts present different options forinformation structure in general; andSyntactic differences between the cleftsserve to constrain how information canbe divided up between presuppositionand assertion in the three cleft types.While none of these factors serve in isolation toexplain the function of the cleft types, in combina-tion, and in addition to the functions claimed aboveto be general to clefts, they are powerful determi-nants of syntactic hoice.First of all, the three types offer different options forthe serial ordering of information.
One serial order-ing constraint appears to be related to the way textsare processed psychologically: asGarnham et al\[ 1982\]have shown, speakers may enhance ase of process-ing for the hearer by optimising REFERENTIALCONTINUITY in the discourses they produce.
For ex-ample, the/t-cleft in (11) below may be preferred tothe wh-cleft in (12), because in (11) the order of inwhich important referents of the discourse are speci-fied is the discontinuous rabbit-birthday-rabbit-birth-day, while in (12) it is the continuous rabbit-rabbit-birthday-birthday:(11) Kevin wants a rabbit, because it was arabbit I got for my birthday.
My birthdayis in January.
(12) Kevin wants a rabbit, because what I gotfor mybirthday was a rabbit.
My birthdayis in January.Psychological research (cf.
Clark and Haviland \[1977\])suggests, in addition, that speakers may also prefernot to postpone the presupposed part of the message.This is because the presupposed part of the utterancemay be the important part with respect to the embed-ding of information in memory.
In some case,,~, choiceof a particular type of cleft would allow the bulk ofinformation in the cleft head to postpone the presup-position unduly, as might be the case in/t-clefts andreverse wh-clefts.
This leads to a prefereno~ for thecleft in which the presupposed information is pre-sented firstmthe wh-cleft--in cases where the non-presupposed information is lengthy.
This could ac ocount for the preferability of the wh-cleft in (13) overthe /t-cleft in (14) for presenting the following con-tent:(13) What I want to find is some formal thing Ican use to follow the complex definitionsof these feature structures.
(14) It's some formal thing I can use to followthe complex definitions of these featurestructures that I want to find.As a second eterminant ofthe choice between clefts,it is possible to show on the basis of an analysis of therelationship between the presupposed propositionand the context hat the kinds of information that canappear as the presupposition of each of the threetypes of cleft are distinct.
As noted above, itis alreadywell known that presuppositions defined in a fairlyconventional sense need not consist of informationthat is currently available to the hearer.
In fact, it isclear that for clefts at least the status of the presup-posed information with respect to context is more orless independent of whether it is presented as apresupposition.The corpus reveals that clefts of all three types havedifferent profiles with respect o the types of infor-mation that it is possible to convey as presupposi-tion.
For example, wh-clefts cannot be use(| to pre-suppose information that is New in context, while it-clefts can.
This produces a strong preference for the/t-cleft in (15b) over the wh-cleft in (15a) below, forexample:(15) A: Sue, this is Marta.
(a) B: #Hi!
What I stayed in when you werein the States was your fiat.
(b) B: Hi!
It was your fiat I stayed in whenyou were in the States.86 4Other distinctions of this nature exist between thethree cleft types (cf.
Delin \[1989:178ff for a full expo-sition).
For example, inferrable relations of somekinds are unavailable toboth/t-cleft and reverse wh-cleft presuppositions, while Old information-thatis, information that is currently available in context--appears very rarely in reverse wh-cleft presupposi-tions.
These tendencies, although not a suitable basisfor rules about the information structure of clefts,could form a.valid basis for a set of preference weight-ings to be used in the decision between the cleft ypesin a given context.In addition to the differences in the informationstatus of presupposed information i the three clefttypes, the analysis of the corpus showed a moregeneral pattern of distinctions in information struc-ture.
Firstly, as Prince \[1978\] has observed, thereappear to be two distinctive arrangements of infor-mation preferred for it-clefts: the most common hasNew information in the complement, and Old orInferrable in the head; less common was a secondpattern, with New information borne by the headconstituent and Old or inferrable information i thecomplement.
These arrangements are comparable toPrince's informative presupposition and stressed-focusit-clefts respectively.
The most common pattern forwh-cleft,; had Old or more usually inferrable infor-mation in the complement and New in the head,while the pattern in all the reverse wh-clefts was ananaphoric (Old) head and New or inferrable infor-marion borne in the complement.
Aswith the prefer-ences for presupposition types noted above, thesefactors could form the basis for weightings tobe usedin syntactic hoice.The fourth factor distinguishing the clefts from oneanother is the different range of constituent typesthat can appear as cleft head in each case, serving toconstrain in different ways what can be conveyed bythe cleft.
The full range of constraints i  presented inDelin \[1989:55ff\]; to demonstrate briefly here, onlywh-clefts are comfortable with bare infinitives ashead:(16) What Martin wanted to do was eat themango.
(17) *It was eat the mango that Martin wantedto do.
(18) *Eat the mango was what Martin wantedto do.Similarly, only/t-clefts can take NP + not until ashead:(19) It was not until three that she left.
(20) *Not until three was when she left.
(21) *When she left was not until three.Reverse wh-clefts are the only cleft type able to takepronominal it and which as head:(22) This camera--and it is what I need-isexpensive.
(23) This camera, which is what I need, isexpensive.
(24) *This camera--and what I need is it.-- isexpensive.
(25) *This camera, what I need is which, isexpensive.
(26) *This camera--and it is it that I need--isexpensive.
(27) *This camera, it is which that I need, is ex-pensive.Syntactic factors exist, therefore, that would serve tocondition the choice between the three types of cleft.Conc lus ionUsing the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic factorsdiscussed above it is possible to suggest in outline atwo-stage decision procedure for the generation ofchfft constructions.
The first stage is concerned withdetermining whether to use a cleft.
Taking a givenproposition to convey as content, he generator hasfirst to determine the following:?
Is a variable-containing presuppositionrequired?Does the residue of con tent left over frompresupposing constitute a suitable in-stantiation of the variable in the presup-position??
Is that instantiation the maximal onepossible in the context??
Is the instantiation novel?The second phase deals with the choice between thethree cleft types.
On a 'generate-and-test' approachto sentence generation, the possible reali.~ations ofthe arrangements of semantic ontent arrived at onthe basis of the first stage of the process can beexamined for the following features:?
Which are syntactically acceptable??
Which provides the optimum serial or-dering of information?Which places information of the appro-priate type in the presupposed portion ofthe sentence??
Which has appropriate overall informa-5 87tion structure?It is predicted that the result of the above proceduremay be no clefts at all, or more than one.
Either esultis acceptable, since it is clear that, just as it is notalways appropriate to produce a cleft, neither is italways the case that only one cleft is possible.It is dear that the above suggestions are only a smallstep towards an implementable algorithm.
How-ever, in the course of this paper I hope to have showntwo things in particular: the importance of corpus-based descriptive work to underpin decision proce-dures for syntactic hoice, and the importance ofavoiding the assumption that syntactic hoice is auniquely pragmatic, or even a merely" stylistic', phe-nomenon.Re ferencesAtlas, J.
