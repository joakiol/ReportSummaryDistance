Resolving Translat ion Mismatches With  Information FlowMegumi Kameyama, Ryo Ochitani, Stanley PetersThe Center for the Study of Language and InformationVentura Hall, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305ABSTRACTLanguages differ in the concepts and real-world en-tities for which they have words and grammaticalconstructs.
Therefore translation must sometimesbe a matter of approximating the meaning of asource language text rather than finding an exactcounterpart in the target language.
We propose atranslation framework based on Situation Theory.The basic ingredients are an information lattice, arepresentation scheme for utterances embedded incontexts, and a mismatch resolution scheme definedin terms of information flow.
We motivate our ap-proach with examples of translation between En-glish and Japanese.1 IntroductionThe focus of machine translation (MT) technol-ogy has been on the translation of sentence struc-tures out of context.
This is doomed to limitedquality and generality since the grammars of un-like languages often require different kinds of con-textual information.
Translation between Englishand Japanese is a dramatic one.
The definitenessand number information required in English gram-mar is mostly lacking in Japanese, whereas the hon-orificity and speaker's perspectivity information re-quired in Japanese grammar is mostly lacking inEnglish.
There are fundamental discrepancies inthe extent and types of information that the gram-mars of these languages choose to encode.An MT system needs to reason about the contextof utterance.
It should make adequate assumptionswhen the information required by the target lan-guage grammar is only implicit in the source lan-guage.
It should recognize a particular discrepancybetween the two grammars, and systematically re-act to the needs of the target language.We propose a general reasoning-based model forhandling translation mismatches.
Implicit informa-tion is assumed only when required by the targetlanguage grammar, and only when the source lan-guage text allows it in the given context.
Transla-tion is thus viewed as a chain of reactive reasoning*Linguistic Systems, Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd.between the source and target languages.
1An MT system under this view needs: (a) a uni-form representation of the context and content ofutterances in discourse across languages, (b) a set ofwell-defined reasoning processes within and acrosslanguages based on the above uniform representa-tion, and (c) a general treatment of translation mis-matches.In this paper, we propose a framework based onSituation Theory (Barwise and Perry 1983).
Firstwe will define the problem of translation mismatches,the key translation problem in our view.
Second wewill define the situated representation of an utter-mace.
Third we will define our treatment of transla-tion mismatches as a flow of information (Barwiseand Etchemendy 1990).
At the end, we will discussa translation example.2 What  is a translation mismatch?Consider a simple bilingual text:EXAMPLE I: BLOCKS (an AI problem)EWGLISH:Consider the blocks world wiCh three blocks,A, B, and C. The blocks A and B are on the table.C is on A.
Which blocks are clear?JAPAIIESE:mlt tu  no tumak i  A to  B to  C g~ 6ru  tumi ld  no  sekLi  wo ~ngaetethree  o f  b lock  A and  B and  C NOM ex is t  b lock  of  wor ld  ACC cons iderm/rut ryA to  ta no  tun~k i  ha  tnkue  no  ueA and  B of  b lock  TOP IC  t&ble of  &bore LOC r id ingC h l  A mo ue n |  not te i ruC TOP IC  A of  .bore  LOC r id ingn&nimo ue  as not te lna i  tam/h i  h l  dote  hnoth in& above  LOC r id ing  b lock  TOP IC  wh ich  ?Note the translation pair C is on A and C t~ A ~9_h~j~-~w~ (C ha A no .e ni nofteirn).
In En-1 Such a reasoning-based MT system is one kind of "negotiation"-based system, as proposed by Martin Kay.
We thank him forstimulating our thinking.193glish, the fact that C is on top of A is expressedusing the preposition on and verb is.
In Japanese,the noun _1= (ue) alone can mean either "on top of"or "above", and there is no word meaning just "ontop of".
Thus the Japanese translation arrows therelationship to the one that is needed by bringingin the verb j~-~ 77 w ~ (notteirn) 'riding'.
This phe-nomenon of the same information being attached todifferent morphological or syntactic forms in differ-ent languages i a well-recognized problem in trans-lation.TRANSLATION DIVERGENCES 2 o f  this kind mani-fest themselves at a particular epresentation level.They can be handled by (i) STRUCTURE-TO-STRUCTURETRANSFERS, e.g., structural transformations of Na-gao (1987), the sublanguage approach of Kosaka etal (1988), or by (ii) TRANSFER VIA A "DEEPER"COMMON GROUND, e.g., the entity-level of Carbonelland Tomita (1987), the lexical-conceptual structureof Dorr (1990).
A solution of these types is not gen-eral enough to handle divergences at all levels, how-ever.
More general approaches to divergences allow(iii) MULTI-LEVEL MAPPINGS, i.e., direct transferrules for mapping between different representationlevels, e.g., structural correspondences of Kaplan etal.
(1989), typed feature structure rewriting sys-tem of Zajac (1989), and abduction-based systemof Hobbs and Kameyama (1990).We want to call special attention to a less widelyrecognized problem, that of  TRANSLATION MISMATCHES.They are found when the grammar of one languagedoes not make a distinction required by the gram-mar of the other language.
For instance, Englishnoun phrases with COUNT type head nouns mustspecify information about definiteness and number(e.g.
a town, the town, towns, and the towns arewell-formed English noun phrases, but not town).Whereas in Japanese, neither definiteness nor num-ber information is obligatory.
Note the translationpair Which blocks are clear?
and f~ %_h~77W~ W~\]~Cg~ ~?~ ( Nanimo ne ni notteinai tnmikiha dore ka) above.
Blocks is plural, but tnmiki hasno number information.A mismatch as a predictable ffect in each trans-lation direction.
From English into Japanese, theplurality information gets lost.
From Japanese intoEnglish, on the other hand, the plurality informa-tion must be explicitly added.Consider another example, a portion of step-by-step instructions for copying a file from a remotesystem to a local system:EXAMPLE 2: FTP~Thls term was taken from Dorr (1990) where the prob-lem of divergences in verb predicate-argument structures wastreated.
Our use of the term extends the notion to cover amuch more general phenomenon.ENGLISH:2.

Thisinformation must be made explicit for each of thesereferences in translating from Japanese into Englishwhether or not it is decidable.
It gets lost (at leaston the surface) in the reverse direction.Two important consequences for translation fol-low from the existence of major mismatches be-tween languages.
First in translating a source lan-guage sentence, mismatches can force one to drawupon information ot expressed in the sentenceinformation only inferrable from its context at best.Secondly, mismatches may necessitate making in-formation explicit which is only implicit in the sourcesentence or its context.
For instance, the alterna-tion of viewpoint between user and system in theFTP example is implicit in the English text, de-tectable only from the definiteness of noun phraseslike "a/the user name" and "a password," but Japanesegrammar equires an explicit choice of the user'sviewpoint o use the reflexive pronoun zibsn.When we analyze what we called translation di-vergences above more closely, it becomes clear thatdivergences are instances of lexical mismatches.
Inthe blocks example above, for instance, there is amismatch between the spatial relations expressedwith English on, which implies contact, and Japanese194ue, which implies nothing about contact.
It so hap-pens that the verb "notteiru" can naturally resolvethe mismatch within the sentence by adding the in-formation "on top of".
Divergences are thus lexicalmismatches resolved within a sentence by coocur-ring lexemes.
This is probably the preferred methodof mismatch resolution, but it is not always possi-ble.
The mismatch problem is more dramatic whenthe linguistic resources of the target language offerno natural way to match up with the informationcontent expressed in the source language, as in theabove example of definiteness and number.
Thisproblem has not received adequate attention to ourknowledge, and no general solutions have been pro-posed in the literature.Translation mismatches are thus a key transla-tion problem that any MT system must face.
Whatare the requirements for an MT system from thisperspective?
First, mismatches must be made rec-ognizable.
Second, the system must allow relevantinformation from the discourse context be drawnupon as needed.
Third, it must allow implicit factsbe made explicit as needed.
Are there any system-atic ways to resolve mismatches at all levels?
Whatare the relevant parameters in the "context"?
Howcan we control contextual parameters in the transla-tion process?
Two crucial factors in an MT systemare then REPRESENTATION and REASONING.
Wewill first describe our representation.3 Represent ing  the  t rans la t ion  con-tent  and  contextTranslation should preserve the information con-tent of the source text.
This information has at leastthree major sources: Content, Context, Language.From the content, we obtain a piece of informationabout the relevant world.
From the context, weobtain discourse-specific and utterance-specific in-formation such as information about the speaker,the addressee, and what is salient for them.
Fromthe linguistic forms (i.e., the particular words andstructures), through shared cooperative strategiesas well as linguistic conventions, we get informationabout how the speaker intends the utterance to heinterpreted.D ISTR IBUT IVE  LATT ICE  OF INFONS.In this approach, pieces of information, whether?
they come from linguistic or non-linguistic sources,are represented as infons (Devlin 1990).
For an n-place relation P, ((P, Zl, .
.
.
,z ,  ;1)) denotes the in-formational item, or infon, that zl,  ..., xn stand inthe relation P, and ((P, Zl , .
.
.
,zn ;0)) denotes theinfon that they do not stand in the relation.
Givena situation s, and an infon or, s ~ ~ indicates thatthe infon a is made factual by the situation s, reads supports ~r .Infons are assumed to form a distributive latticewith least element 0, greatest element 1, set I ofinfons, and "involves" relation :~ satisfying: 3for infons cr and r, if s ~ cr and cr ~ rthen s ~ 1-This distributive lattice (I, =~), together with anonempty set Sit of situations and a relation ~ onSit x I constitute an infon algebra (see Barwise andEtchemendy 1990).THE L INGUIST IC  INFON LATT ICE .
Wepropose to use infons to uniformly represent infor-mation that come from multiple "levels" of linguis-tic abstraction, e.g., morphology, syntax, semantics,and pragmatics.
Linguistic knowledge as a wholethen forms a distributive lattice of infons.For instance, the English words painting, draw-ing, and picture are associated with properties; callthem P1, P2, and P3, respectively.
In the followingsublattice, a string in English (EN) or Japanese(JA)is linked to a property with the SIGNIFIES relation(written ==),4 and properties themselves are inter-linked with the INVOLVES relation (=~):EN: "picture" ~-= Pl ( (p icture,  x; 1))EN: "paint ing" == P2((painting, x; 1))EN: "drawing" == P3((drawing, x; 1))EN: "oil painting" =----- P4((oil painting, x; 1~EN: "water-color" == Ph((water-color, x; 1))P2 ?> P1, P3 ~ P1, P4 =P P2, PS =P P2So far the use of lattice appears no different fromfamiliar semantic networks.
Two additional factorsbring us to the basis for a general translation frame-work.
One is multi-linguality.
The knowledge ofany new language can be added to the given latticeby inserting new infons in appropriate places andadding more instances of the "signifies" relations.The other factor is grammatical nd discourse-functionalnotions.
Infons can be formed from any theoreticalnotions whether universal or language-specific, andplaced in the same lattice.Let us illustrate how the above "picture" sublat-tice for English would be extended to cover Japanesewords for pictures.
In Japanese, ~ (e) includes bothpaintings and drawings, but not photographs.
It isthus more specific than picture but more generalthan painting or drawing.
No Japanese words co-signify with painting or drawing, but more specificconcepts have words--  ~ (aburae) for P4,(suisaiga) for P5, and the rarely used word ~(senbyou) for artists' line drawings.
Note that syn-onyms co- signify the same property.
(See Figure 1for the extended sublattice.
)3We assmne that the relation =~ on infons is transitive,reflexive, and anti-symmetric after Barwise and Etchemendy.4This is our addition to the infon lattice.
The SIGNIFIESrelation links the SIGNIFIER and SIGNIFIED to forrn a SIGN (deSaussure 1959).
Our notat ion abbreviates standard infons,e.g., ((signifies, "picture", EN, P1; 1)) .195EN:"p ic ture  n m---- P1 ((picture,x; I))nEN:-p~intins~ JA: 'e m m--.-- P6 ((e,z; 1))((p~tnting,z; 1))P2 P3 ((drawlns,x;l))----~ EN:Sdrawing"R> P7 ((line dr&wing,z;1))({oil p&intins,~c; 1))P4 P5 ((water.colorjc;1)) %% JA :asenbyou ~EN:~o i l  p~nt ing  j EN:aw&ter .co lo r  jJA :U&burae"  JA: =suis~lga =Figure 1: The "Picture" Sublattice((give, x, y, .

For instance, corresponding to theEnglish verb give, Japanese has six basic verbs ofgiving, whose distinctions hinge on the speaker'sperspectivity and honorificity.
For "X gave Y to Z"with neutral honorificity, ageru has the viewpointon X, and burets, the viewpoint on Z. Sasiageruhonors Z with the viewpoint on X, and l~udasaruhonors X with the viewpoint on Z, and so on.
SeeFigure 2.As an example of grammatical notions in the lat-tice, take the syntactic features of noun phrases.English distinguishes six types according to the pa-rameters of count/mass, number, and definiteness,whereas Japanese noun phrases make no such syn-tactic distinctions.
See Figure 3.
Grammatical no-tions often draw on complex contextual propertiessuch as "definiteness", whose precise definition is aresearch problem on its own.THE S ITUATED UTTERANCE REPRE-SENTAT ION.
A translation should preserve asfar as practical the information carried by the sourcetext or discourse.
Each utterance to be translatedgives information about a situation being described--precisely what information depends on the contextin which the utterance is embedded.
We will utilizewhat we call a SITUATED UTTERANCE REPRESEN-TATION (SUR) to integrate the form, content, and~ N ~  UN~:JA=;0))Figure 3: The "NP" Sublatticecontext of an utterance.
5 In translating, contextualinformation plays two key roles.
One is to reducethe number of possible translations into the targetlanguage.
The other is to support reasoning to dealwith translation mismatches.Four situation types combine to define what anutterance is:Descr ibed Situation The way a certain piece ofreality is, according to the utterancePhrasal Situation The surface form of the utter-anceD iscourse  S i tuat ion  The current state of the on-going discourse when the utterance is producedUt terance  S i tuat ion  The specific situation wherethe utterance is producedThe content of each utterance in a discourse likethe Blocks and FTP examples is that some situa-tion is described as being of a certain type.
Thisis the information that the utterance carries aboutthe  DESCRIBED SITUATION.The PHRASAL SITUATION represents the surfaceform of an utterance.
The orthographic or phonetic,phonological, morphological, and syntactic aspectsof an utterance are characterized here.The DISCOURSE SITUATION is expanded here insituation theory to characterize the dynamic as-pect of discourse progression drawing on theoriesin computational discourse analysis.
It capturesthe linguistically significant parameters in the cur-rent state of the on-going discourse, s and is espe-cially useful for finding functionally equivalent re-ferring expressions between the source and targetlanguages.

reference time = the time pivot of the linguisticSOur character izat ion of the context  of ut terance drawson a number  of exist ing approaches to discourse representa-t ion and discourse processing, most  notably  those of Groszand Sidner (1986), Discourse Representat ion Theory (Kamp1981, Helm 1982), S i tuat ion Semant ics (Barwise and Perry1983, Gawron and Peters 1990), and Linguist ic DiscourseModel (Scha and Polanyi 1988).
?Lewis (1979) discussed a number  of such parameters  ina logical framework.7Different forms of referring expressions (e.g.

Specif-ically, it describes the initial steps in copying afile from a remote system to a local system withftp.
Consider the first utterance in instruction step~uttering, x,u, t; 1 ~ ^ ~addressing, ~, y,  t; 1Note that the parameter y of DeS for the user(to whom the discourse is addressed) has its valueconstrained in US; the same is true of the param-eter t for utterance time.
Similarly, the parameterr of DeS for the definite remote system under dis-cussion is assigned a definite value only by virtue ofthe information in DiS that it is the unique remotesystem that is salient at this point in the discourse.This cross-referencing of parameters between typesconstitutes further support for combining all foursituation types in a unified SUR.
In order for theanalysis and generation of an utterance to be as-sociated with an SUIt, the grammar of a languageshould be a set of constraints on mappings amongthe values assigned to these parameters.4 T rans la t ion  as  in fo rmat ion  f low3 repeated here: Type the  user name fo r  your.

See,e.g., Scha and Polanyi (1988) and Hobbs (1990) for discoursestructure models.guage since languages differ in the concepts andreal-world entities for which they have words andgrammatical constructs.In the cases where no translation with exactly thesame meaning exists, translators eek a target lan-guage text that accurately describes the same realworld situations as the source language text.
12 Thesituation described by a text normally includes ad-ditional facts besides those the text explicitly states.Human readers or listeners recognize these addi-tional facts by knowing about constraints that holdin the real world, and by getting collateral informa-tion about a situation from the context in which adescription is given of it.
For a translation to bea good approximation to a source text, its "fleshedout" set of facts--the facts its sentences explicitlystate plus the additional facts that these entail byknown real-world constraints--should be a maximalsubset of the "fleshed out" source text facts.Finding a translation with the desired propertycan be simplified by considering not sets of facts(infons) but infon lattices ordered by involvementrelations including known real-world constraints.
Ifa given infon is a fact holding in some situation,all infons in such a lattice higher than the givenone (i.e., all further infons it involves) must alsobe facts in the situation.
Thus a good translationcan be found by looking for the lowest infons in thelattice that the source text either explicitly or im-plicitly requires to hold in the described situation,and finding a target language text that either ex-plicitly or implicitly requires the maximal number12In some special cases, translation requires mapping be-tween different hut equivalent real world situations, e.g., carsdrive on different sides of the street in Japan and in the US.197of them to hold.
13THE INFORMATION FLOW GRAPH.
Trans-lation can be viewed as a flow of information that re-sults from the interaction between the grammaticalconstraints of the source language (SL) and thoseof the target language (TL).
This process can bebest modelled with information flow graphs (IFG)defined in Barwise and Etchemendy 1990.
An IFGis a semantic formalization of valid reasoning, and isapplicable to information that comes from a varietyof sources, not only linguistic but also visual andother sensory input (see Barwise and Etchemendy1990b).
By modelling a treatment of translationmismatches with IFGs, we aim at a semanticallycorrect definition that is open to various implemen-tations.IFGs represent five basic principles of informationflow:Given  Information present in the initial assump-tions, i.e., an initial "open case.
"Assume Given some open case, assume somethingextra, creating an open subcase of the givencase.Subsume Disregard some open case if it is sub-sumed by other open cases, any situation thatsupports the infons of the subsumed case sup-ports those of one of the subsuming cases.Merge  Take the information common to a numberof open cases, and call it a new open case.Recognize as Possible Given some open case, rec-ognize it as representing a genuine possibility,provided the information present holds in somesituation.RESOLVING MISMATCHES.
First~ a trans-lation mismatch is recognized when the generationof a TL string is impossible from a given set of in-fons.
More specifically,given a Situated Utterance Representation(SUIt), when no phrasal situations of TLsupport SUR because no string of TL sig-nifies infon a in SUR, The TL grammarcannot generate a string from SUR, andthere is a TRANSLATION MISMATCH on 0 r.A translation mismatch on ~, above is resolved inone of two directions:Mismatch Resolut ion by Specification:Assume a specific case r such that r =:~and there is a Phrasal Situation of TL thatsupports v. A new open case SUR' is thengenerated, adding r to SUR.13As more sophist icated translation is required, We couldmake use of the multiple situation types to give more impor-tance to some aspects of translation than others dependingon the purpose of the text (see Hauenschild (1988) for suchtranslaion eeds).This is the case when the Japanese word ~ (e) istranslated into either painting or drawing in English.The choice is constrained by what is known in thegiven context.Mismatch Reso lu t ion  by  Genera l i za -t ion: Assume a general case r such that a=~ r and there is a Phrasal Situation of TLthat supports r. A new open case SUR' isthen generated, adding 7- to SUR.This is the case when the Japanese word ~ (e) istranslated into picture in English, or English wordsppainting and drawing are both translated into(e) in Japanese.
That is, two different utterancesin English, I like this painting and I like this draw-ing, would both be translated into ~J~l'~ Ot l~f f~'~ (watasi wa kono e ga suki desn) in Japaneseaccording to this scheme.Resolution by generalization is ordinarily less con-strained than resolution by specification, even thoughit can lose information.
It should be blocked, how-ever, when generalizing erases a key contrast fromthe content.
For example, given an English utter-ance, I like Matisse's drawings better than paintings,the translation into Japanese should not generalizeboth drawings and paintings into ~ (e) since thatwould lose the point of this utterance completely.The mismatches must be resolved by specification ithis case, resulting in, for instance, $J~1"~'?~" 4 gO~tt~e~A~ \]: 9 ~ ~ t ~  ~'t?
'J" ( watasi wa Ma-tisse no abnrae ya snisaiga yorimo senbyou ga sukidest 0 ' I  like Matisse's line_drawings(P7) better thanoil_paintings(P4) or water-colors(P5)'.There are IFGs for the two types of mismatchresolution.
Using o for an open (unsubsumed) nodeand ?
for a subsumed node, we have the following:Mismatch Resolution by Specification: (given r :~ a)Given: o{a} Assume: ?
{a}/6{?, ~}Mismatch Resolution by Generalization: (given o" :?, ?
)Given: o{a} Assume: l{a} Subsume: l{a}6{?,?}
~{q,T}Both resolution methods add more infons to thegiven SUR by ASSUMPTION, but there is a differ-ence.
In resolution by specification, subsequent sub-surnption does not always follow.
That is, only bycontradicting other given facts, can some or all ofthe newly assumed SUR's later be subsumed, andonly by exhaustively generating all its subcases, theoriginal SUR can be subsumed.
In resolution bygeneralization, however, the newly assumed generalcase immediately subsumes the original SUR.
1414Resolution by specification models a form of abductiveinference, and generalization, a form of deductive inference198Source  Language  Target  L~ngu@geD iscourseS i tuat ionsDiS  1 .. DiS  mUt teranceS i tuat ionsUS 1 ..

Each mismatch resolution involves AS-SUMING new SUR's and SUBSUMING inconsistent orsuperfluous SUR's.
~sOur focus here is the epistemologicai aspect oftranslation, but there is a heuristically desirableproperty as well.
It is that the proposed mismatchresolution method uses only so much additional in-formation as required to fill the particular distancebetween the given pair of linguistic systems.
Thatis, the more similar two languages, leas computa-tion.
This basic model should be combined withvarious control strategies such as default reasoningin a sltuation-theoretic context.
One way to implement thesemethods i in the abduction-based system proposed by Hobbsand Kameyama (1990).~SA possible use of MERGE in this application is that twodifferent SUit's may be merged when an identical TL stringwould be generated from them.

~ -~'-- \]- ":/.~ ~'J-~'C'~'J ~ ' f f )7"~ / ~ = - - - ~ ~ "  7"L~ ~- -y~9-o  "1.
In the initial SUR are infons for 9 -~-- b ":I ~ ~"(rimoofo sisutemu) 'remote system', 7' ~:I i.
(akaunfo) 'account', and : ' - - - '~  (yu~zaamei) 'user name'.
All of thesewords ignifyproperties that are signified by English COUNTnouns but the Japanese SUR lacks definitenessand number information.2.
Generation of English from the SUR fails be-cause, among other things, English grammarrequires NPs with COUNT head nouns to be ofthe type, Sg-Def, Sg-Indef, PI-Def, or Pl-Indef.
(translation mismatch)3.
This mismatch cannot be resolved by general-ization.
It is resolved by assuming four sub-cases for each nominal, and subsuming thosethat are inconsistent with other given informa-tion.
The "remote system" is a singular entityin focus, so it is Sg-Def, and the other threesubcases are subsumed.
The "user name" isan entity in center, so Definite.
The "account"is Definite despite its first mention because itspossesser (addressee) is definite.
Both "username" and "account" can be either Singular orPlural at this point.
Let's assume that a formof default reasoning comes into play here andconcludes that a user has only one user nameand one account name in each computer.4.
The remaining open case permits generation ofEnglish noun phrases, so the translation of thisutterance is done.OUTPUT STRING: "Type the user name for youraccount on the remote system and ..."6 Conc lus ionsIn order to achieve high-quality translation, weneed a system that can reason about the context ofutterances to solve the general problem of transla-199tion mismatches.
We have proposed a translationframework based on Situation Theory that has thisdesired property.
The situated utterance represen-tation of the source string embodies the contextualinformation required for adequate mismatch reso-lution.
The translation process has been modelledas a flow of information that responds to the needsof the target language grammar.
Reasoning acrossand beyond the linguistic levels, this approach totranslation respects and adapts to differences be-tween languages.7 Future  imp l i ca t ionsWe plan to design our future implementation ofan MT system in light of this work.
Computationalstudies of distributive lattices constrained by multi-ple situation types are needed.
Especially useful lin-guistic work would be on grammaticized contextualinformation.
More studies of the nature of transla-tion mismatches are also extremely desirable.The basic approach to translation proposed herecan be combined with a variety of natural languageprocessing frameworks, e.g., constraint logic, ab-duction, and connectionism.
Translation systemsfor multi-modal communication and those of multi-ple languages are among natural extensions of thepresent approach.8 AcknowledgementsWe would like to express our special thanks toHidetoshi Sirai.
