Melodic cues to turn-taking in English: evidence from perceptionAnne WICHMANNDepartment of Cultural Studies,University of Central LancashirePreston PR1 2HE,United Kingdom,awichmann@uclan.ac.ukJohanneke CASPERSPhonetics Laboratory,Universiteit Leiden Centre for LinguisticsCleveringaplaats 12311 BD Leiden, The Netherlands,j.caspers@let.leidenuniv.nlAbstractThis paper presents a study of the effects ofsyntax and melodic configuration on turn-taking in Southern British English.
Usingdialogue materials, two perceptionexperiments were carried out.
In the first,subjects heard dialogue fragments in whichsyntactic completeness and melodic contourwere systematically varied, and were askedwhether they expected a subsequent turnexchange or not.
In the second, subjectswere presented with short speakerexchanges taken from the same material,and asked whether they thought the firstspeaker had intended to cede the turn or not.The results suggest that syntactic completionor non-completion is the main factor inpredicting turn-taking behaviour.
Only onemelodic contour, the high level tone H* %,appears to operate as a turn holding device,regardless of whether the utterance isgrammatically complete or not.
The resultsof this study were found to be similar tothose of a study of Dutch turn-taking.IntroductionMost studies of the intonational cues to turn-taking have been carried out qualitatively withinthe theoretical framework of ConversationAnalysis (e.g.
Wells & Macfarlane 1998, Selting1996).
An exception to this is the study by Fordand Thompson (1996), who found that turn-changes in American English mostly appearwhen melodic, syntactic and pragmaticcompletion coincide.
Two recent studies of themelodic cues to turn-taking in Dutch (Caspers2000, 2001) motivate the present study, whichuses comparable English data to replicate as faras possible the perception experiments carriedout in Caspers (2001).
On the basis of thefindings for Dutch we expected syntacticcompleteness to be the overriding predictor of apossible turn change.
Where melody has aneffect, we hypothesised that, as in Dutch, thehigh level tone was likely to signal more tocome and that no subsequent turn change wouldbe expected (Caspers 1998).
We also hoped togain some insight into possible similarities anddifferences between the two languages.1 MaterialsThe data used for these experiments was takenfrom Map Task data, recorded according to theMap Task conventions described in Anderson etal.
(1991), and collected as part of the IViEproject (Grabe et al in preparation).
We chosedialogues recorded in Cambridge, as theyrepresented most closely the standard southernvariety of British English.2 Data AnalysisFollowing the method used by Caspers (2001),two complete Map Tasks (approximately 30minutes of speech) were divided into inter-pausal units (IPUs, cf.
Koiso et al 1998) using apause threshold of 100ms.
Boundaries were thencategorised according to three criteria.Firstly, each IPU boundary was identified aseither occurring within the turn of the samespeaker, (category HOLD) or involving a changeof speaker (category CHANGE).
Secondly, thetext before each IPU boundary was judged forsyntactic completion.
If the utterance was atleast potentially complete at that point theboundary was categorised as syntacticallycomplete, otherwise as ?not complete?.
Finally,we selected a set of IPUs according to their finalcontour, identified in terms of the British systemof ?nuclear tones?
(fall, rise etc.)
and inautosegmental-metrical terms of final pitchaccent and subsequent boundary tone.
(Following Gussenhoven et al (1999) weincluded the possibility of a boundary tone thatwas neither low nor high, transcribed as %.)
Weidentified IPUs ending in one of the followingcontours: a high rise (H* H%), a high level (H*%), a fall-rise (H*L H%), a fall (H*L L%) and atruncated fall (H*L %).3 MethodIn the first experiment, subjects were presentedwith a dialogue fragment ending at an IPUboundary.
The subjects?
task was to predict whathappens next, i.e.
whether the speaker holds theturn, or holds after a brief backchannel response,or cedes the turn.
In the second experiment weagain asked subjects to judge what the firstspeaker had intended - to continue or to cede theturn, but under slightly different conditions: thistime subjects heard brief exchanges involvingboth speakers.
This was to see if the presence ofan actual response influenced subjects?judgement of the first speaker?s intention.
Thesame subjects took part in both experiments.They were 25 native speakers of SouthernBritish English, 9 men and 16 women, agedbetween 19 and 54, only 7 of whom had somebackground in linguistics.
No hearingdifficulties were reported.4 Experiment One4.1 Stimulus materialFor the first experiment, the stimuli consisted ofdialogue fragments, around 8 to 13 seconds inlength, and ending in an IPU.
The fragmentswere chosen such that they ended according tothe following four conditions:(i) turn exchange plus syntactic completion(ii) turn exchange minus syntactic completion(iii) turn hold plus syntactic completion(iv) turn hold minus syntactic completionThe five contours chosen were as listed inparagraph 2 above.
For all but the high rise (H*H%) two stimuli were chosen for each of theabove conditions, giving 32 stimuli.
As syntacticcompletion could, of course, includeinterrogatives, which would be highly likely toproject a turn change, these were avoided for allbut one stimulus for the fall-rise contour andthree for the high rise.
We found very few casesof the high rise in the English data, aninteresting finding in itself, and it was notpossible to find examples for each condition;only six cases were used altogether, foursyntactically complete (two interrogatives andtwo declaratives) and two syntacticallyincomplete.4.2 ProcedureAfter three practice examples, the 38randomised stimuli were each presented twice.Subjects were asked to predict whether (1) thecurrent speaker would continue, (2) the currentspeaker would continue after a short, non-obligatory backchannel response, or (3) thesecond speaker would take over.4.3 ResultsThe results for this experiment are given inTables 1 and 2.
Table 1 gives the frequency ofresponses per condition, and Table 2 showswhether the differences in number of turn-keeping responses between the contour types aresignificant.
Note that in the latter table weconflate the responses ?hold?
and backchannel?,since, despite subtle pragmatic differences, wejudged the prediction of a backchannel to entailthe prediction of a turn continuation (cf.
Koiso etal.).

Thismeans that there are main effects as well asinteraction effects of contour type andgrammatical completion on the responses.Table 1 shows that subjects virtually neverexpect a turn change when the fragment issyntactically incomplete (2%).
The onlysignificant differences in the number of expectedturn-keepings (?backchannel?
plus ?hold?)
arefound between contours H*L L% and H*L H%and between H*L L% and H*L %, but theseeffects are rather small (see Table 2).
The maindifference appears to be the degree to whichcontours invite a backchannel response.

In this respect it differs stronglyfrom all other contours, as is evident from thedata presented in Table 2.The results for the syntactically complete H*H% stimuli reflect the utterance type, and shouldtherefore be treated with caution.
Notsurprisingly, the two interrogatives attractedalmost exclusively the judgement 'change'; theremaining two declaratives attracted almostexclusively the judgement 'backchannel'.
Theuse of a high rise on declaratives is a recent andhighly marked innovation in British English, andis assumed to have the function of elicitinghearer acknowledgment.
Our results areconsistent with this view.As Table 2 shows, there was an interestingand significant difference between the effect ofthe complete fall (H*L L%) and the truncatedfall (H*L %).
The truncated fall is much morelikely to cue a turn hold (71% of responsescompared with 41% for the complete fall) andcorrespondingly less likely to cue a turn change(29% compared with 59% for the complete fall).4.4 DiscussionThe results of this experiment suggest that, inthis variety of English, incomplete syntaxoverrides any melodic cues.
Only the high leveltone appears to be a strong turn keeping device,regardless of syntax.
On the other hand thereappear to be no melodic contours which, whenthey occur in conjunction with syntacticcompleteness, can be said to predict a turnchange.
We thus find more evidence for the useof melody as a turn keeping device than as a turnceding device.
The second experiment wasdesigned to investigate the degree to which suchjudgements of speaker intention were upheld inthe presence of an actual speaker response.5 Experiment Two5.1 Stimulus materialThe stimuli for this part of the experiment weredrawn from the same material as in Part A. Eachfragment that ended in the original data in a turnexchange was extended to include the turnexchange itself.
This produced a sound file ofaround 8 to 12 seconds in length.
The turnexchange was then excised as a short separatefile of around 3 to 5 seconds.
Regardless ofcontour, a speaker change at a syntacticallyincomplete point was hard to find in our data,and a number of these stimuli were createdartificially by editing out intervening material.5.2 ProcedureThe same subjects participated in both parts ofthe experiment.
They were first presented withthe longer fragment containing the relevant turnexchange, and then heard the file containingonly the turn exchange twice in succession.
The20 stimuli (4 for each contour) were preceded bythree test stimuli.
The subjects were asked tojudge whether the first speaker had expected theturn exchange, had expected to continue, orwhether it was unclear.5.3 ResultsTables 3 and 4 contain the results for the secondexperiment.

In contrast with thefirst experiment, however, there is a clearinfluence of contour type on the responses in theminus syntactic completion condition: in almosta third of the cases subjects feel that the originalspeaker had expected the turn to change after adefault pitch accent (H*L) followed by a low(L%) or high (H%) boundary tone, that is, after acomplete fall or after a fall-rise, and Table 4shows that these two contour types differsignificantly from all others (except from eachother).
The similarity between the complete falland the fall-rise, which is also evident in thesyntactic completion condition, suggests thatboth contours are perceived to have a similarfunction with respect to turn-taking and to be atleast strong secondary cues to turn completion.In cases where there is a clear mismatchbetween syntax and contour (i.e.
melodiccompletion but no syntactic completion) theactual presence of a speaker change makessubjects more likely to judge that this was theintention of the first speaker than they were inthe first experiment, where they did not knowwhat happened next.Although subjects were simply asked tojudge what they thought the first speaker hadintended, their judgements were probably tosome extent based on a post hoc analysis of thewhole exchange.
It is a general principle ofpragmatics that utterances will be assumed to berelevant unless proved otherwise, and thatconversational interaction will be assumed to becooperative unless proved otherwise.
There istherefore a strong likelihood that subjectssubconsciously sought a cooperative explanationfor actual turn changes wherever possible.6 General DiscussionThe major finding of this study, especially of thefirst part, is that if an isolated utterance issyntactically incomplete, listeners are highlyunlikely to predict a turn change, whatever themelodic contour used.
Where the syntax iscomplete, none of the contours lead listeners topredict exclusively a turn change.
This meansthat both hold and change are possible at thispoint.
There is one exception, namely where theaccompanying contour is a high level tone (H*%).
This contour in English appears to signal aclear turn hold, regardless of syntax.We were also able to make some cross-linguistic comparisons.
First, the similarities: itappears that in both Southern British Englishand Dutch the H* % contour signals thespeaker?s intention to keep the turn.
This effectcannot be attributed to the absence of a ?real?boundary tone, since the truncated fall, whichalso ends in a %, does not behave as a cue toturn-keeping.We also observed two main differencesbetween the languages.
The first concerns theoccurrence of high rise tones (H* H%): we haddifficulty in finding any of these in the Englishdata but not in the Dutch, which may indicate ageneral difference in contour distribution, or adifference in contour function in the twolanguages.
This is an interesting question to posein a larger-scale, corpus-based study.The second difference relates to ourobservation that some contours are more likelythan others to suggest a subsequent backchannelresponse.
This has important implications for thestudy of cooperation in interaction, both withinand between languages (cf.
Wichmann 2000).The number of ?backchannel?
judgements givenas responses to the stimuli ending in a high leveltone H* % differs between Dutch and English:Caspers (2001) reports that in the Dutch study56% of these contours suggest a backchannelresponse, compared to only 6% in the Englishstudy.
This difference may have consequencesfor cross-cultural communication: if types ofconversational behaviour are ?appropriate?
in onelanguage but not in the other there is potentialfor cross-cultural misunderstandings which maybe perceived as ?attitudinal?.7       ConclusionThe results of this study of English turn-takingsupport the Dutch findings of Caspers (2001),suggesting that while there are no melodiccontours which reliably predict a turn change,the high level contour (H* %) creates the strongpercept in both languages of a turn continuation,regardless of whether the utterance issyntactically complete or not.
Other contoursappear to operate at most as secondary cues toturn-taking, with syntactic completion or non-completion having the stronger effect.A further observation - that some contoursare more amenable to a backchannel responsethan others - suggests differences between thetwo languages which may have important cross-cultural implications.While the answers to some of these questionsmay more suitably be sought using othermethods, notably corpus-based analysis, weconsider that such approaches arecomplementary to the perceptual evidencereported here.AcknowledgementsThanks to Brechtje Post for providing the data,Rachael-Anne Knight for helping with theexperiments, and Bill Nelson and Geoffrey Potter fortechnical support.
