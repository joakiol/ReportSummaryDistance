We show that while thereis a large degree of ambiguity in temporalexplicit discourse connectives, overall con-nectives are mostly unambiguous and al-low high-accuracy prediction of discourserelation type.
We achieve 93.09% accu-racy in classifying the explicit relationsand 74.74% accuracy overall.
In addition,we show that some pairs of relations oc-cur together in text more often than ex-pected by chance.
This finding suggeststhat global sequence classification of therelations in text can lead to better results,especially for implicit relations.1 IntroductionDiscourse relations between textual units are con-sidered key for the ability to properly interpretor produce discourse.
Various theories of dis-course have been developed (Moore and Wiemer-Hastings, 2003) and different relation taxonomieshave been proposed (Hobbs, 1979; McKeown,1985; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Knott andSanders, 1998).
Among the most cognitivelysalient relations are causal (contingency), contrast(comparison), and temporal.Very often, the discourse relations are explicit,signaled directly by the use of appropriate dis-course connectives:c?

(E1) He is very tired because he played tennis all morning.
(E2) He is not very strong, but he can run amazingly fast.
(E3) We had some tea in the afternoon and later went to arestaurant for a big dinner.Discourse relations can also be implicit, inferredby the context of the utterance and general worldknowledge.
(I1) I took my umbrella this morning.

(I2) She is never late for meetings.
[but] He always arrives10 minutes late.
(I3) She woke up early.
[afterward] She had breakfast andwent for a walk in the park.An additional complication for automatic clas-sification of discourse relations is that even in thepresence of an explicit discourse connective, theconnective might be ambiguous between severalsenses.
For example, since can be used to signaleither a temporal or a contingency relation.They have not spoken to each other since they argued lastfall.
(Temporal)I assumed you were not coming since you never replied tothe invitation.
(Causal)Several questions directly related to efforts inautomatic recognition of discourse relations arise:In a general text, what is the proportion of ex-plicit versus implicit relations?
Since implicit rela-tions are presumably harder to recognize automati-cally, the larger their proportion, the more difficultthe overall prediction of discourse relation will be.How ambiguous are discourse connectives?The degree of ambiguity would give an upperbound on the accuracy with which explicit rela-tions can be identified.
The more ambiguous dis-course connectives are, the more difficult it wouldbe to automatically decide which discourse rela-tion is expressed in a given sentence, even in thepresence of a connective.87In a text, are adjacent discourse relations inde-pendent of each other or are certain sequences ofrelations more likely?
In the latter case, a ?dis-course grammar?
of text can be used and easy toidentify relations such as unambiguous explicit re-lations can help determine the class of implicit re-lations that immediately follow or precede them.In this study, we address the above questions us-ing the largest existing corpus manually annotatedwith discourse relations?the Penn Discourse TreeBank (Prasad et al, 2008).2 The Penn Discourse Tree BankThe Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is a new re-source (Prasad et al, 2008) of annotated discourserelations.
The annotation covers the same 1 mil-lion word Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus usedfor the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1994).he PDTB is the first corpus to systematicallyidentify and distinguish explicit and implicit dis-course relations.
By definition, an explicit relationis triggered by the presence of a discourse con-nective which occurs overtly in the text.
The dis-course connective can essentially be viewed as adiscourse-level predicate which takes two clausalarguments.
For example, sentence E1 above couldbe represented as BECAUSE(?He is very tired?,?he played tennis all morning?).
The corpus rec-ognizes 100 such explicit connectives and containsannotations for 19,458 explicit relations1.The PDTB also contains provisions for the an-notation of implicit discourse relations betweenadjacent sentences which are inferred by the readerbut are not overtly marked by a discourse connec-tive.
In this case, the annotator was asked to pro-vide a connective that best captured the inferredrelation.
There are a total of 16,584 implicit rela-tions annotated in the corpus.2In addition to discourse relations and their ar-guments, the PDTB also provides the senses ofeach relation(Miltsakaki et al, 2008).
The tagsetof senses is organized hierarchically into three lev-els - class, type, and subtype.
The top class levelcontains the four major semantic classes: Expan-sion, Comparison, Contingency and Temporal.1The PDTB allows annotators to tag a relation with multi-ple senses.
In this work we count both of the annotated senses.So even though there are only 18,459 explicit relations, thereare 19,458 explicit senses.2Again, because of multiple senses per relation, the 16,584senses are part of 16,224 relations.Class Explicit (%) Implicit (%) TotalComparison 5590 (69.05%) 2505 (30.95%) 8095Contingency 3741 (46.75%) 4261 (53.25%) 8002Temporal 3696 (79.55%) 950 (20.45%) 4646Expansion 6431 (42.04%) 8868 (57.96%) 15299Table 1: Discourse relation distribution in seman-tic and explicit/implicit classes in the PDTB3 Distribution and ambiguity ofconnectivesTable 1 shows the distribution of discourse rela-tions between the four main relation classes andtheir type of realization (implicit or explicit).
In-terestingly, temporal and comparison relations arepredominantly explicit.
About 80% and 70%, re-spectively, of their occurrences are marked by adiscourse connective.
The contingency relationsare almost evenly distributed between explicit andimplicit.
The expansion relations, the overalllargest class of discourse relations, is in most casesimplicit and not marked by a discourse connective.Given the figures in Table 1, we would expectthat overall temporal and comparison relations willbe more easily identified since they are overtlymarked.
Of course this would only be the case ifdiscourse markers are mostly unambiguous.Here we show all connectives that appear morethan 50 times in the PDTB, their predominantsense (comparison, contingency, temporal or ex-pansion), as well as the percentage of occurrencesof the connective in its predominant sense.
Forexample the connective but has comparison as itspredominant sense and 97.19% of the 3,308 occur-rences of this connective were comparisons.Comparison but (3308; 97.19%), while (781; 66.07%),however (485; 99.59%), although (328; 99.70%),though (320; 100.00%), still (190; 98.42%), yet (101;97.03%)Expansion and (3000; 96.83%), also (1746; 99.94%), forexample (196; 100.00%), in addition (165; 100.00%),instead (112; 97.32%), indeed (104; 95.19%), more-over (101; 100.00%), for instance (98, 100.00%), or(98; 96.94%), unless (95; 98.95%), in fact (82; 92.68%)separately (74; 100.00%)Contingency if (1223; 95.99%), because (858, 100.00%),so (263; 100.00%), since (184; 52.17%), thus (112;100.00%), as a result (78; 100.00%)Temporal when (989; 80.18%), as (743; 70.26%), af-ter (577; 99.65%), then (340; 93.24%), before (326;100.00%), meanwhile (193; 48.70%), until (162;87.04%), later (91; 98.90%), once (84; 95.24%)The connectives that signal comparison andcontingency are mostly unambiguous.
Obviousexceptions are two of the connectives that are oftenused to signal temporal relations: while and since.88The predominant senses of these connectives arecomparison (66.07%) and contingency (52.17%)respectively.
Disambiguating these problematicconnectives has already been addressed in previ-ous work (Miltsakaki et al, 2005), but even thepredominantly temporal connectives are rather am-biguous.
For example less than 95% of the occur-rances of meanwhile, as, when, until, and then aretemporal relaions.While some connectives such as ?since?
are am-biguous, most are not.
The discourse connec-tives in the corpus appear in their predominantsense 93.43% (for comparsion), 94.72% (for con-tingency), 84.10% (for temporal), and 97.63% (forexpansion) of the time.
Temporal connectives aremost ambiguous and connectives signaling expan-sion are least ambiguous.4 Automatic classificationThe analyses in the previous section show two verypositive trends: many of the discourse relations areexplicitly marked by the use of a discourse connec-tive, especially comparison and temporal relations,and discourse connectives are overall mostly un-ambiguous.
These facts would suggest that evenbased only on the connective, classification of dis-course relations could be done well for all data (in-cluding both implicit and explicit examples) andparticularly well for explicit examples alone.
In-deed, Table 2 shows the performance of a decisiontree classifier for discourse relations, on all dataand on the explicit subset in the second and thirdcolumn respectively.We use the natural distribution of relationclasses found in theWall Street Journal texts, with-out downsampling to get balanced distribution ofclasses.
There are four task settings, distinguishingeach type of relation from all others.
For example,comparison relations can be distinguished from allother relations in the corpus with overall accuracyof 91.28%, based only on the discourse connective(first line in Table 2).
The recall for recognizingcomparison relations is 0.66, directly reflecting thefact that 31% of all comparison relations are im-plicit (Table 1) and the connective feature did nothelp at all in those cases.
Over explicit data only,the classification accuracy for comparison relationversus any other relation is 97.23%, and precisionand recall is 0.95 and above.As expected, the overall accuracy of identify-ing contingency and expansion relations is lower,Task All relations Explicit relations onlyComparison 91.28% (76.54%) 97.23% (69.72%)Contingency 84.44% (76.81%) 93.99% (79.73%)Temporal 94.79% (86.54%) 95.4% (79.98%)Expansion 77.51% (55.67%) 97.61% (65.16%)Table 2: Decision tree classification accuracy us-ing only the presence of connectives as binary fea-tures.
The majority class is given in brackets.Class Precision RecallTemporal 0.841 [0.841] 0.729 [0.903]Expansion 0.658 [0.973] 0.982 [0.957]Contingency 0.948 [0.947] 0.369 [0.844]Comparison 0.935 [0.935] 0.671 [0.971]Table 3: Four-way classification.
The first numberis for all data, thesecond for explicit relations only.84.44% and 77.51% on all data respectively, re-flecting the fact that these relations are often im-plicit.
But by themselves these accuracy numbersare actually reasonable, setting a rather high base-line for any more sophisticated method of classify-ing discourse relations.
On explicit data only, thetwo-way classification accuracy for the four maintypes of relations is 94% and higher.In four-way classification, disambiguating be-tween the four main semantic types of discourserelations leads to 74.74% classification accuracy.The accuracy for four-way classification of explicitrelations is 93.09%.
The precision and recall foreach class is shown in Table 4.
The worst per-formance on the explicit portion of the data is theprecision for temporal relations and the recall forcontingency relations, both of which are 0.84.5 N-gram discourse relation modelsWe have shown above that some relations, such ascomparison, can be easily identified because theyare often explicit and are expressed by an unam-biguous connective.
However, one must build amore subtle automatic classifier to find the implicitrelations.
We now look at the frequencies in whichvarious relations are adjacent in the PDTB.
Resultsfrom previous studies of discourse relations sug-gest that the context of a relation can be helpful indisambiguating the relation (Wellner et al, 2006).Here we identify specific dependencies that existbetween sequences of relations.We computed ?2statistics to test the indepen-dence of each pair of relations.
The question is:do relations A and B occur adjacent to each othermore than they would simply due to chance?

For example, ex-plicit comparison and implicit contingency co-occur much more often than would be expected ifthey were independent.
As explicit comparisonsare generally fairly easy to identify, knowing thatthey tend to co-occur may be helpful when search-ing for implicit contingency relations in a text.6 ConclusionWe have tried to summarize the difficulty of find-ing discourse relations using the Penn DiscourseTreebank.
We noted that explicit and implicit rela-tions are approximately evenly distributed overall,making the task easier than many researchers havefeared.
We have found that some relations, such astemporal and comparison, are more likely to be ex-plicit than implicit, making them relatively easierto find, while contingency and expansion are moreoften implicit.
Among the discourse connectives,the majority are not very ambiguous between thedifferent types of relations, with some notable ex-ceptions such as since and meanwhile.We have carried out a novel quantitative studyof the patterns of dependencies between discourserelations.
We found that while there does not ap-pear to be a clear template for the sequence ofrelations, there are individual relation pairs thattend to co-occur.
Specifically, we found that eventhough contingency relations are likely to be im-plicit and thus difficult to find, they are likely tobe found near an explicit comparison.
We plan toexploit these findings in future work, addressingdiscourse relation labeling in text as a sequence la-beling problem and using the explicit cue wordsof surrounding relations as features for finding the?hidden?
implicit relations.7 AcknowledgmentsThis work was partially supported by an Integra-tive Graduate Education and Research Traineeshipgrant from National Science Foundation (NSF-IGERT 0504487) and by NSF Grant IIS -07-05671.
