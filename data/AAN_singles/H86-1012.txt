Focusing and Reference Resolution in PUNDITFocus ing  and Reference  Reso lu t ion  in PUNDITDeborah A. DahlResearch and Development.
DivisionSDC -- A Burroughs CompanyPO Box 517Paoli, PA 19301Science TrackNatural LanguageABSTRACTThis paper describes the use of focusing in the PUNDIT text processing system.
1Focusing, as discussed by \[Sidner1979\] (as well as the closely related concept of center-ing, as discussed by \[Grosz1983\] ), provides a powerful tool for pronoun resolution.However, its range of application is actually much more general, in that it can be usedfor several problems in reference resolution.
Specifically, in the PUNDIT system, focus-ing is used for one-anaphora, elided noun phrases, and certain types of definite andindefinite noun phrases, in addition to its use for pronouns.
Another important featurein the FUNDIT reference resolution system is that tile focusing algorilJnn is based onsyntactic constituents, rather than on thematic roles, as in Sidner's system.
Thisfeature is based on considerations arising from the extension of focusing to cover one-anaphora.
These considerations make syntactic focusing a more accurate predictor ofthe interpretation of one-anaphoric noun phrases without decreasing the accuracy fordefinite pronouns.1 This  work  is supported in par t  by DARPA under  cont ract  N00014-85-C-0012,  admin is tered  by the Office of  Nava l: Research.114Focusing and Reference Resolut ion in PUNDIT1.
Background1 .1 .
Focus ingLinguistically reduced forms, such as pronouns, are typically used in texts to referto the entity or entities with which the text is most centrally concerned.
2 Thus, keep-ing track of this entity, (the topic, of \[Gundel1974\], the focus of \[Sidner1979\], and thebackward-looking center of \[Grosz1983, Kameyama1985\] ) is clearly of value in theinterpretation of pronouns.
However, while 'pronoun resolution' is generally presentedas a problem in computational linguistics to which focusing can provide an answer (Seefor example, the discussion in \[Hirst1981\]), it is useful to consider focusing as a prob-lem in its own right.
By looking at focusing from this perspective, it can be seen thatits applications are more general than simply finding referents for pronouns.
Focusingcan in fact play a role in the interpretation of several different ypes of noun phrases.In support of this position, I will show how focus is used in the PUNDIT (PrologUNDerstander of Integrated Text) text processing system to interpret a variety offorms of anaphoric reference; in particular, pronouns, elided noun phrases, one-anaphora, and context-dependent full noun phrase references.A second position advocated in this paper is that surface syntactic form can pro-vide an accurate guide to determining what entities are in focus.
Unlike previous focus-ing algorithms, such as that of \[Sidner1979\], which used thematic roles (for example,theme, agent, instrument as described in \[Gruber1976\] ), the algorithm used in thissystem relies on surface syntactic structure to deternfine which entities are expected tobe in focus.
The extension of the focusing mechanism to handle one-anaphora has pro-vided the major motivation for the choice of syntactic focusing.The focusing mechanism in this system consists of two parts--a FocusL is t ,  whichis a list of entities in the order in which they are to be considered as loci, and a focus-ing algorithm, which orders the FocusL is t .
The implementation is discussed in detailin Section 5.1.2- Overv iew of  the  PUNDIT  Sys temI will begin with a brief overview of the PUNDIT system, currently underdevelopment at SDC.
PUNDIT is written in Quintus Prolog 1.5.
It is designed tointegrate syntax, semantics, and discourse k1~owledge in text processing for limiteddomains.
The system is implemented as a set of distinct interacting components whichcommunicate with each other in clearly specified and restricted ways.The syntactic omponent, Restriction Grammar,\[Hirschman1982, Hirschman1985\],performs a top-down parse by interpreting a set of context-free BNF definitions andenforcing context-sensitive restrictions associated with the BNF definitions.
The gram-mar is generally modelled after that developed by the NYU Linguistic String Project\[Sager1981\].
Restrictio~s which enforce context-sensitive constraints on the parse areassociated with the bnf rulesI am grateful for the helpfnl comments of Lynette Hirschman, Marcia Linebarger, Martha  Palmer,  and Rebecca Schiffmanon this paper.
John Dowding and \[3onnie Webber also provided useful comments and suggestions on an earlier version.115Focus ing  and  Reference  Reso lu t ion  in  PUNDITSome semantic filtering of the parse is done at the noun phrase level.
That is,alter a noun phrase is parsed, it is passed t~o the noun phrase semantics component,which determines if there is an acceptable semantics associated with that parse.
If thenoun phrase is acceptable, the semantics component constructs a semantic represents-Lion.
If the noun phrase is not semantically acceptable, another parse is sought.At the conclusion of parsing, the sentence-level semantic interpreter is called.
Thisinterpreter is based on Pahner's Inference Driven Semantic Analysis system, \[Pal-mer1985\], which analyzes verbs into their component meanings and fills their thematicroles.
In the process of filling a thematic role the semantic analyzer calls reference reso-lution for a specific syntactic constituent in order to find a referent o fill the role.Reference resolution instantiates the referent, and adds to the discourse representationany information inferred during reference resolution.Domain-specific nformation is available for both the noun phrase and clause levelsemantic components through the knowledge base.
The domain currently beingmodelled by SDC is that of computer maintenance r ports.
Currently the knowledgebase is implemented as a semantic net containing a part-whole hierarchy and an iuahierarchy of the components and entities in the application domain.Following the semantic analysis, a discourse component is called which updatesthe discourse representation to include the information from the current sentence andwhich runs the focusing algorithm.2.
Uses  o f  Focus ingFocusing is used ill four places in PUNDIT -- for definite pronouns, for elidednoun phrases, for one-anaphora, and for implicit associates.As stated above, reference resolution is called by the semantic interpreter when itis in the process of filling a thematic role.
Reference resolution proposes a referent forthe constituent associated with that role.
For example, if the verb is replace and thesemantic interpreter is filling the role of agent ,  reference resolution would be calledfor the surface syntactic subject.
After a proposed referent is chosen tbr the subject,any specitic selectional restrictions on the agent of replace (such as the constraint thatthe agent has to be a human being) are checked.
If the proposed referent fails selec-tion, backtracking into reference resolution occurs and another referent is selected.Cooperation between reference resolution and the semantic interpreter is discussed indetail in \[Pahner1986\].
The semantic interpreter itself is discussed in \[Palmer1985\].2.1.
P ronouns  and  E l ided  Noun PhrasesPronoun resolution is done by instantiating the referent of the pronoun to the firstmember of the FocusL is t  unless the instantiation would violate syntactic onstraintson coreferentiality.
3 (As noted above, if the proposed referent fails selection,3 At the moment, the syntactic constraints on coreferentiality used by the system are very simple.
If the direct object isreflexive it must be instantiated to the same referent, as the subject.
Otherwise it must be a different referent.
Obviously, as thesystem is extended to cover sentences with more complex structures, a more sophisticated treatment of syntactic constraints on116Focus ing  and Reference Reso lu t ion  in PUNDITbacktracking occurs, and 'another referent is chosen.
)The reference resolution situation in the maintenance t xts however, is compli-cated by the fact that there are very few overt pronouns.
Rather, in contexts where anoun phrase would be expected, there is often elision, or a zero-np as in Won't powerup and Has not failed since Hill's arrival.
Zeroes are handled exactly as if they werepronouns.
The hypothesis that elided noun phrases can be treated in the same way aspronouns is consistent with previous claims in \[Gundel1980 \] and \[Kameyama1985\] thatin languages uch as Russian and Japanese, which regularly allow zero-np's, the zerocorresponds to the focus.
If these claims are correct, it is not surprising that in a sub-language like that found in the maintenance t xts, which also allows zero-np's, the zeroshould correspond to the focus.Another kind of pronoun (or zero) also occurs in the maintenance t xts, which isnot associated with the local focus, but is concerned with global aspects of the text.For example, the field engineer is a default agent in the maintenance domain, as inThinks problem is in head select area.
This is handled by defining default elidedreferents for the domain.
The referent is instantiated to one of these if no suitablecandidate can be found in the FocusL is t .2.2.
Imp l i c i t  AaaoclateaFocttni,,g is also used in the processing of certain full noun phrases, both definiteand inde\[i,,ite, which involve implicit associates.
The term implicit associates refersto tile relationship between a disk drive and the motor in examples like The fieldengineer installed a disk drive.
The motor failed.
It is natural for a human reader toinfer that the motor is part of the disk drive.
In order to capture this intuition, it isnecessary for the system to relate the motor to the disk drive of which it is part.
Rela-tionships of this kind have been extensively discussed in the literature on definite refer-ence.
For example, implicit associates correspond to inferrable entities described by\[Prince1981\], the associated use definites of \[Hawkins1978\], and the associated typeof implicit backwards pecification discussed by \[Sidner1979\].
Sidner suggests thatimplicit associates should be found among the entities in focus.
Thus, when the systemencounters a definite noun phrase mentioned for the first time, it sequentially examineseach member of the FoeusL is t  to determine if it is a possible associate of the currentnoun phrase.
The specific association relationships (such as part-whole, object-property, and so on) are defined in the knowledge base.This mechanism is also used in the processing of certain indefinite noun phrases.In every domain, it is claimed, there are certain types of entities which can beclassified as dependent.
By this is meant an entity which is not typically mentioned onits own, but which is referred to in  connection with another entity, on which it isdependent.
In the maintenance domain, for example, parts such as keyboards, motors,and printed circuit boards are dependent, since when they are mentioned, they are nor-mally mentioned as being part of something else, such as a console, disk drive, orcoindexing using some of the insights of \[Reinhart1976\], and \[Chomsky1981\] will be required.117Focus ing  and Reference Reso lu t ion  in PUNDITprinter.
4 In an example like The system is down.
The field engineer eplaced a badprinted circuit, board, it seems clear that a relai,ionship between the pr inted circuitboard and the system should be represented.
Upon encounter ing a reference to adependeni, eni,ity like the printed circuii, board, the system looks through theFocusL is t~ 13o determine if any previously mentioned entities can be associated with apr inted circuii, board, and if so, the relationship is made explicit.
If no associate hasbeen mentioned, the entity will be associated wii,h a default defined in the knowledgebase.
For example, in the maintenance domain, parts are defined as dependent  enti-ties, and in the absence of an explicitly mentioned associate, they are represented asassociated with the system.2.3 -  One-AnaphoraPUNDIT  extends focusing to the analysis of one-anaphora following \[Dahl1984\],which claims that focus is central to the interpretat ion of one-anaphora.
Specifically,the referent of a one-anaphoric noun phrase (e.g., the blue one, some large ones) isclaimed to be a member or members of a set which is the focus of the current clause.For example, in Installed two disk drives.
One failed, the set of two disk drives isassumed to be the focus of One failed, and the disk drive I hat failed is a member  ofthai, set.
This analysis can be contrasted with thai, of \[ll:,,lliday1976\], which treatsone-anaphora s a surface syntactic phenomenon, completely distinct from reference.It is more consistent with the theoretical discussions of \[1976\], and \[Webber1983\].
5These analyses advocate a discourse-pragmatic I,reatment for both one-anaphora nddefinite pronouns.
The main computat ional  advantage of treat ing one-anaphora s adiscourse problem is that, since definite pronouns are treated this way, littlemodif ication is needed to the basic anaphora mechanism to allow it to handle one-anaphora.
In contrast, an implementat ion following the account of Hal l iday andHasan would be much more complex and specitic to one-anaphora.The process of reference resolution for one-anaphora occurs in two stages.
Thefirst stage is resolution of the anaphor, one, and this is the stage that  involves focus-ing.
When the system processes the head noun one, it instantiates it with thecategory of the first set in the FocusL is t ;  (disk drive in this example).
6 In otherwords, the referent of the noun phrase must be a member of the previously ment ionedset of disk drives.
The second stage of reference resolution for one-anaphora assigns aspecific disk drive as the referent of the entire noun phrase, using the  same proceduresthat  would be used for a full noun phrase, a disk drive.The extension of the system to one-anaphora provides the clearest mot ivat ion forthe choice of a syntactic focus in PUNDIT.
Before I discuss the kinds of examples4 There are exceptions to this generalization.
For example, in a sentence like field engineer ordered motor, the motor onorder is not part of anything else {yet).
In PUNDIT, these cases are assumed to depend on the verb meaning.
In this example, theobject of ordered is categorized as nort-specifie, and reference resolution is not called.
See \[Palmer1986\] for details.s Although not Webber's analysis in \[Webber19781, which advocates an approach similar to Halliday and Hasan's.e Currently the only sets in the FocusL |s t  are those which were explictly mentioned in the text.
ttowever, as pointed outby \[Dahl1982.\], and \[Webber1983, Dahl1984\], other sets besides those explictly mentioned are available for anaphoric reference.These have not yet been added to the system.118Focusing and Reference Resolution in PUNDITwhich support this approach, I will briefly describe the relevant part of the focusingalgorithm based on thematic roles which is proposed by\[Sidner1979\].
After each sen-tence, the focusing algorithms order the elements in the sentence in the order in whichthey are to be considered as potential loci in the next sentence.
Sidner's ordering andthat of PUNDIT are compared in Figure 1.The idea that surface syntax is important in focusing comes from a suggestion by\[Erteschik-Shir1979\], that every sentence has a dominant syntactic constituent, whichprovides a default topic for tile following utterance 7.
Intuitively, the dominant consti-tuent can be thought of as the one to which tile hearer's attention is primarily drawn.Operationally the dominance of a constituent is tested by seeing if a referent with thatconstituent as the antecedent can be cooperatively referred to with an unstressed pro-noun in the following sentence.The feature of onc-anaphora which motivates the syntactic algorithm is that theavailability of certain noun phrases as antecedents for onc-anaphora is stronglyaffected by surface word 'order variations which change syntactic relations, but whichdo not affect thematic roles.
If thematic roles are crucial for focusing, then this patternwould not be observed.Consider the following examples:(i) A: I'd like to plug in this lamp, but the bookcases blocking areoutlets.the electrical\]3: Well, can we move one?
(2) A: I'd like to plug in this lamp, but the electrical outlets are blocked by the book-cases .S idner  PUNDITThemeOther  themat ic  ro lesAgentVerb  PhraseSentenceDi rect  Ob jec tSubjectObjects  of  F repos l t lona l  PhrasesF igure  1: Compar i son  of  Potent ia l  Focns  Order ing  inS idner ' s  Sys tem and PUNDIT7 As discussed in \[Dah119fi4\] there are problems with Erteschik-Shir's definition of dominance and slightly different definitionis proposed.
However the details of this reformulation do not concern us here.119Focus ing  andReference  Reso lu t ion  i n  PUNDITB: Well, can we move one?In (1), rnosl, informants report an initial impression that B is talking about movingthe electrical outlets.
This does not happen for (2).
This indicates that  the expectedfocus following (1) A is the outlets, while it is the bookcases in (1) B.
However, in eachcase, the thematic roles are the same, so an algorithm based on thematic  roles wouldpredict no difference between (1) and (2).Similar examples using definite pronouns do not seem to exhibit the same effect.In {3) and (4), they seems to be ambiguous, until world knowledge is brought in.
Thus,in order to handle definite pronouns alone, either algorithm would be adequate.
(3) A:B:(4) A:B:I'd like to plug in this lamp, but bookcases are blocking the electrical outlets.Well, can we move them?I'd like to plug in this lamp, but the electrical outlets are blocked by the book-cases.Well, can we move them?
(5) and (6) i l lustrate another example with one-anaphora.
In (5) but not in (6),the initial interpretation seems to be that a bug has lost its leaves.
As in (1) and (2),however, the thematic roles are the same, so a thematic-role-based algorithm wouldpredict no difference between the sentences.
(5) The plants are swarming with the bugs.
One's already lost all its leaves.
(6) The bugs are swarming over the plants.
One's already lost all its leaves.In addit ion to theoretical considerations, there are a number of obvious practicaladvantages to defining tbcus on constituents rather than on thematic roles.
For exam-ple, constituents can often be found more reliably than thematic roles.
In addit ion,thematic roles hage to be defined individually for each verb.
8 Since thematic roles forverbs can vary across domains, defining focus on syntax makes it less domain depen-dent, and hence more portable.
While in principle focus based on themat ic  roles doesnot have to be domain-dependent,  a general algorithm based on thematic  roles wouldhave to rely on a a general, domain-neutral specification of all possible themat ic  rolesand their behavior in focusing.
Until such a specification exists, a thematic-role basedfocusing algorithm must be redefined for each new domain as thedomain  requires thedefinition of new thematic roles, and because of this, will continue to be less portablethan an approach based oll syntax.8 Of course, some generalizations can be made about how arguments map to thematic roles.
For example, tile basicdefinition of the thematic role theme is that, for a verb of motion, the theme is the argument hat moves.
More generally, thetheme is tile argument that is most affected by the action of the verb, and its typical syntactic manifestation is as a direct objectof a transitive verb, or the subject of an intransitive verb.
However, even if these generalizations are accurate, they are no morethan guidelines for finding tile themes of verbs.
The verbs still have to be classified individually.120Focusing and Reference Reso lut ion  in PUNDIT3.
Imp lementat ion3.1 .
The FocusL is t  and  Cur rentContextThe data structures that retain information from sentence to sentence in thePUNDIT system are the FocuaL ia t  and the Cur rentContext .
The FoeuaL ia t  isa list of all the discourse entities which are eligible to be considered as foci, listed inthe order in which they are to be considered.
For example, after a Sentence like Thefield engineer eplaced the disk drive, the following FoeuaL ia t  would be created.\[\[ev eat1  \ ] , \ [d r ive l  \ ] , \ [engineer  111The members of the FocusL is t  are unique identifiers that have been assigned to thethree discourse entities -- the disk drive, the field engineer, and the event.
TheCur rentContext  contains the information that has been conveyed by the discourseso far.
After the example above, the Cur rentContext  would contain three types ofinformation:(1) Discourse id's, which represent classifications of entities.
For example,id ( f ie ld^eng ineer , \ [eng ineer l \ ] )  means that \ [eng ineer l \ ]  is a a field engineer.
9(2) Facts about part-whole relationships (haspar ts ) .
In the example in Figure 2,notice that the lack of a representation of time results in both drives being part ofthe system, which they are, but not at the same time.
W~,rk to remedy this prob-lem is in progress.
(3) Representations of the events in the discourse.
For example, if the event is that ofa disk drive having been replaced, the representation consists of a uniqueidentifier ( \ [event l \ ] ) ,  the surface verb ( rep lace( t ime(_) ) ) ,  and the decomposi-tion of the verb with its (known) arguments instantiated 1?.
The thematic rolesinvolved are ob jec t1 ,  the replaced disk drive, ob jeet2 ,  the replacement diskdrive, t ime and ins t rument  which are uninstantiated, and agent ,  the fieldengineer.
(See\[Palmer1986\], for details of this representation).
Figure 2 illustrateshow the Cur r .entContext  looks after the discourse-initial sentence, The fieldengineer eplaced the disk drive.3.2 .
The Focus ing  A lgor i thmThe focusing algorithrn used in this system resembles that of \[Sidner1979\],although it does not use the actor focus and uses surface syntax rather than thematicroles, as discussed above.
The focusing algorithm is illustrated in Figure 3.
Removingcandidates from the FoeuaL ia t  when they are no longer eligible to be the referents ofpronouns is not currently done in this system.
The conditions determining this havenot been fully investigated, and since the texts involved are short, few problems arecreated in practice.
This problem will be addressed by future research.m f ield'englneer is an example of the representation used in PUNDIT  for an idiom.,s 8176 is an uninstantiated variable representing the t ime off the replacement.

SummarySeveral interesting research issues are raised by this work.
For example, what isthe source of the focusing algorithm?
Is it derivable from theoretical considerationsabout how language is processed by human beings, or is it simply an empirical obser-vation about conventions used in particular languages to bring discourse ntities intoprominence?
Evidence bearing on this issue would be to what extent the focusingmechanism c:.trries over to other, non-related languages.
Kameyama's work onJapanese sug~(,.sts hat there are some similarities across languages.
To the extent thatsuch similarities exist, it would suggest that the algorithm is derivable from othertheoretical considerations, and is not simply a reflection of linguistic conventions.This paper has described the reference resolution component of PUNDIT, a largetext understanding system in Prolog.
A focusing algorithm based on surface syntacticconstituents i used in the processing of several different types of reduced reference:definite pronouns, onc-anaphora, elided noun phrases, and implicit associates.
Thisgenerality points out the usefulness of treating focusing as a problem in itself ratherthan simply as a tool for pronoun resolution.123Focus lng and Ret'erence Reso lu t ion  in \ ]PUNDITREFERENCES\[1976\]Jorge Hankamer and Ivan Sag, Deep and Surface Anaphora.
