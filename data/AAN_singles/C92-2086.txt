o f  NHKld0 -11 ,  K inuta,  Setagaya,  Tokyo,  JAPANttanakah@ strl.nhk.or.jp (junet)1 IntroductionCommon verbs such as "take," "have,""make," and "give" appear frequently in Eng-lish.
These verbs quite often constitute verb -deverbal noun structures such as "make an ad-dress," give an answer" and "take an approach.
"The verbs in the structure arc ahnost devoid oflexical meaning but bear syntactic informationsuch as tense, number and person; the deverbalnoun carrying the lexical meaning.
The verbs,in this case, are cal led "dclexical verbs"\[Collins\] or "light verbs," \[Live\] which refers totheir lexical emptiness.In this paper, we call such verbs DelexicalVerbs (DV) and a "DV + deverbal noun struc-ture" a Delexical Structure (DS) Iollowing theexamples ol' \[Collins\].
The frequency of theseverbs in actual text can be seen, for example, inthe COLLINS COBUILD ENGLISH DIC-TIONARY, where the pmagraph on the entry"take" states: "The most frequent use of take is inexpressions where it does not have a very dis-tinct meaning of its" own, but where most of  themeaning is in the noun that follows it..."We have been developing an English to Japa-nese machine translation system for news broad-casts since 1989 \[Aizawa\] \[Tanaka\].
The precisetranslation of DS's in news texts is of great im-portance since they are quite frequent here.
Wecounted the number of "take" + "noun" colloca-tions (as verb + object) in 21 months' worth ofAP texts using the parser of the machine transla-tion system.
"Take" collocated with 2,188 dif-ferent nouns a total of 20,271 times.
Of the col-locating nouns, 87 deverbal nouns were foundout of the 119 deverbal nouns listed in \[Live\],comprising about 28% (5,726) of all occur-rences.
This figure strongly supports the state-ment in the Collins Dictionary.Failures in DS translation typically resultfrom producing the primary sense instead of thedelexical sense of the DV, which greatly dete-rioratcs the quality of the translation.
For ex-ample, "make an address" becomes "enzetsu wotsukuru," which meaTts "create an address.
"There are two possible ways of translating aDS.
The first is the idiosyncratic approach, list-ing all the DS's with their Japanese translationsin a lexical system.
This approach, however,suffers fi'om several shortcomings:(1) The DS's are numerous and hard to listexhaustively: some DS's allow pttssivizationand some deverbal nouns can be modifiedby quantifiers, adjectives and so on.
Thisdoubles and triples the number of possibleDS combinations.
(2) This direct method is unable to infer thetranslation of a DS undefined in a lexicon.
(3) The use of this approach increases thenulnber of lexical entries, making lexicalmanagement difficult.Another approach is to synthesize the transla-tion of a DS using the word sense of each com-ponent with syntactic and semantic rules.
Theattractive part of this "synthetic approach" is thatit does not suffer from the problems mentionedabove.
The "ntonosenty approach" proposed in\[Ruhl\] can be viewed as the extreme manifesta-tion of the synthetic approach.
A recent lexicalframework \[Bograev\] proposes to generate theword sense instead of listing them exhaustivelyin a lexicon, which is similar to the syntheticapproach.However, fl'om a practical viewpoint, not MIDS's can bc translated by this approach as thenecessary rules have not yet been factored out.We propose the use of a DS translation methodbased mainly on synthesis, and the employmentof all idiosyncratic approach where synthesis isdifficult.
To do this, DS's were categorized intothree groups, called type-l ,  type-2, and idio-matic DS.
The first two groups are translated bythe synthetic method and the last group is trans-ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES.

OF COLING-92, NA~CrES, AUG. 23-28, 1992lated by an idiosyncratic approach which canhopefully be integrated into the former part asresearch reveals the underlying rules.
Thismethod should provide clear distinctions be-tween idiomatic and synthesizable DS's throughthe use of a set of rules, which would facilitatethe management of lexical systems.The translation rules are quite simple tbr thefollowing reasons:(1) English DS~s have Japanese quivalentsin many cases, and some parallels can beseen between them.
(2) Many Japanese "verbal nouns" take theform of "sahen-meishi," which becomeverbs by simply adding "suru" to the tail.However, some DS's require translation in apassive sense.
The conditions were factored outthrough semantic onsideration, and were inte-grated into the translation rules.The rules were implemented in the machinetranslation system and AP news texts weretranslated appropriately, thus proving the feasi-bility of this method.2 Delexical StructuresThis section introduces ome definitions andcharacteristics of DS's.
ADS basically takes thefo ml:Delexieal Verb + (determiner) +DeverbalNoun0: optionalas in "give an answer," "make an array,""take an approach," have a battle," "take ad-vice," and "make an announcement."
Verbssuch as "put," "cast," "pay," "lay," and "throw"are also known to work as delexical verbs\[Live\].
These are commonly-used transitiveverbs.DS's have some interesting semantic harac-teristics.
A verb can be substituted for a DS inmany cases, but the substitution isone way: thus"step" for "take a step" but not "take a move" for"move" \[Live\].
The verb-substitutable DS'schoose one of possibly several word senses ofthe corresponding verb except when they aremetaphoric.
The selection is controlled by theco-occuring DV.
Thus the same deverbal nouncan form DS's which represent different mean-ings.make an order ==> request for supplyof goodsgive an order ==> commandThe DS's give a greater colloquial \[Konishi\]and euphemistic impression \[Yamanashi\] thanthe corresponding verb expressions and usedfrequently in modern English \[Live\].Another feature of a DS is that it gives theimpression that the event is brief.
'She gave a scream.
(brief)She screamed.
(not brief)\[Collins\]Some syntactic operations are possible onDS's.
For example, adjectives and possessivepronouns can modify the deverbal noun, andsome DS's can be used in passive forms.In this paper, determiners are mainly consid-ered as the modifier of the deverbal noun sincethey are the basic modifier of the DS's.
Theverbs "take," "make," "have," and "give" arestudied since these are the most common DV's.As a result, we are able to obtain a DS in thefollowing form:DV + (det) + NV (1)0: optionalDV: Delexieal Verb (take, make,have, give)det: a, an, theNV: Deverbal noun3 Categorization of DS'sThe previous section mentioned that a DSchooses a single sense of the correspondingverb.

The whole cate-gorization is summarized below.type-1 DSordinary DS / F L type-2 DSDS L idiomatic DSFigure 3 Categorization of DS's4 Translation strategyThis section describes the basic strategy ofDS translation.
A concrete implementation willbe described in section 6.4.1 Parallels between Japanese and EnglishThe DS categorization i  section three wasbased on the selection of word senses for anEnglish deverbal nouns.
In many cases, we canassume parallels between English and Japanese:(1) The word sense of an English deverbalmmn can be translated into a Japanese wordsense of a deverbal noun.
(2) The verbalization ofan English wordsense in a deverbal noun and theverbalization of the corresponding Japaneseequivalent can represent the same meaning.4.2 Type-1 DSTaking advantage of these parallels, thetranslation of a type-1 DS can be achieved byverbalizing the core Japanese translation of thedeverbal noun in a translation lexicon.As we can see from the table in \[Live\], type-IDS's are predominant.
This justifies the use oftype-1 as the default translation of unknownDS's.As most of this type can be used passively,and since deverbal nouns of this type are some-times modified by adjectives and possessivepronouns, the translation mechanism shouldalso allow the same degree of flexibility.4.3 Type-2 DSThis type can be translated iu approximatelythe same way as type-l.
However, one differ-ence is that this type verbalizes the peripheralJapanese translation i the lexicon.
Since insuf-ficient knowledge has been accrued on whatmakes the DS select he peripheral meaning, thecollocation of DV's and deverbal nouns shouldbe specified in a lexicon.
As this type also per-mits some modification and allows passivetransfommtion, it should be translated by syn-thetic approach.4.4 Idiomatic DS translationThis type does not verbalize any translationof the deverbal noun and is "frozen" in that thedeverbal nouns are rarely modified by adjectivesand the DS does not allow passive transforma-tion.
This type of DS must be listed in a lexiconin its full form with a proper translation.
Theimplied definition of an idiomatic DS here is (1)it does not represent any word sense of individ-ual components and (2) it resists any form oftransformation.5 Passivization rulesSome DS's can be substituted with a match-ing passive verb as shown in \[Live\], so that"take comfort" and "take counsel" can be para-phrased as "be comt'orted" and "be counseled,"respectively.
Though the number of such casesdoes not seem to be large, it is important totranslate them passively, otherwise the meaningof the translation is totally reversed.
Most DS'swhich can be substituted by passive verbsshould be translated in a passive sense in Japa-nese because of the parallels between the twolanguages.
"Take comfort" and "take counsel"should thus be translated "nagusame rareru" and"jyogen wo sareru.
"In this section, some rules tot passivizafionarc obtained by analyzing the \[Live\] table.Conditions for these rules will be sought in thesyntactic and semantic haracteristics of botbthe DV and the deverbal noun.Table 1 is extracted from the table in \[Live\]listing the combinations requiring passive sub-stitution.5.1 Condition for DV"Take" and "have" have about 10 passiveverb substitutable DS's, whereas "make" and"give" have only one.
This suggests that condi-tions depend on the contrasting characteristicsACRES DE COLING-92.

"Take"and "have" have a common characteristic: theaction moves from the object to the subject.With "make" and "give," on the other hand,the action moves from the subject o the object.The characteristics of the take-have typeseems to be the DV condition.

The new transla-tion selection mechanism was implemented byadding some leatures to the existing translationselection mechanism through the use of seman-tic markers.
(1) Idiomatic DSAn idiomatic DS is listed in the translationlexicou as it is with its Japanese translation.
(2) Type-2 DSAmong translations of a deverbal noun, if aperipheral translation is selected by a certainDV, the type-2 marker and the co-occuring DVare specified in the marker field of the transla-tion.
Tbe translation will be verbalized when thedeverbal noun coooccurs with the DV specifiedin the marker field.
(3) Type- 1 DSFor all deverbal nouns, the core translationwill be given a type-1 marker.
When a DS doesnot clloose an idiomatic DS or a type-2 DS, thetranslation witb a type-1 marker will be verbaPized.An exmnple of type- 1 and type-2 markers areshown in figure 6.
The two translations of "ex-ception" can be properly chosen by the descrip-tion.
(4) Passivization ileThe translation of a deverbal noun which sat-isfies the three conditions mentioned in section5 requires a passivization marker in addition to atype-I or type-2 marker.
When they co-occurwith either "have" or "take," the translation willbe verbalized in the passive voice.
(5) VerbalizationMost of the Japanese translations of Englishdeverbal nouns are so called "sahen-meishi.
"Verbalization is done by simply adding "wosuru" to the tail for the active sense and "wosareru" for the passive sense.

Two dictionar-ies were compiled to test the effects of themechanism.
In one of the dictionaries, neces-sary markers were ascribed to 302 deverbalnouns - appearing in \[Live\] - and 4 DV's (take,make, have, give ).
The other dictionary had nosuch modifications.All the March 1991 AP texts which containedboth the DV's and the deverbal nouns mentionedabove were selected by a simple filtering of thetext.
The filtered text was translated using thetwo dictionaries and the results were comparedby human assessment.
Sentences not having a"verb - object" relationship between the DV anddeverbal noun were rejected.

Therevised mechanism thus successfully distin-guished the ambiguity in the word sense of"lead."
In Case 4, the passive verb substitutableDS "took some encouragement," in which thedeverbal noun is modified by "some," was suc-cessfully translated passively into Japanese.In the example which was made worse, "givean impression" was translated into "inshou woshite," which is worse than "inshou wo ataete.
"This is due to the simple verbalization mecha-nism which attaches "suru" to all nouns backedup by heuristics.
The transitive verb form of theJapanese word "inshou (impression)" is "inshouzukeru."
Further elaboration of the verbalizationmechanism, such as the use of a noun/verb con-version table, will solve this problem.The quality of the translation was improvedremarkably, though the translation mechanismwas quite simple.8 ConclusionsA method has been proposed for translatingEnglish delexical verb structures into Japanese.Since this method involves rule-based syn-thesis, transformed and modified DS's wereflexibly translated.
The conditions which re-quire a DS "passive verb substitution" were fac-tored out and included in the translation rule.The feasibility of this method was tested bytranslating AP news texts, which sbowed a re-markable improvement in the quality of transla-tion, with a correct rate of nearly 100%.To achieve better esults, precise verbaliza-tions of Japanese nouns are required, though asimpler method worked well due to the ability toexpress many "verbal nouns" as "sahen-meishi"in Japanese.A voice control rule was developed based onthe "flow of action" of delexical verbs and the"transitivity" of deverbal nouns (the originalverb).
Other delexical verbs such as, "put,""cast," receive," etc, can also be categorized by"flow of action" and can be integrated into tbesame framework to cover a wider range of DStranslations.The role of the other DS components, ar-ticles, possessive pronouns, and prepositionsshould also be explored.The differences between "make" and "give,"and "take" and "have" has been neglected in thisrule.
However the differences between "take"and "have" in certain contexts have been pointedout by \[Wierzbicka\].
It would be interesting toexplore these differences in the context of trans-lation.\[References\]\[Ai:,~twa\] T. Aizawaet al: "A Machine Transla-tion System for Foreign News in SatelliteBroadcasting," Proc.
