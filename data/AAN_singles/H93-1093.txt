EVALUATION AND ANALYS IS  OF AUDITORYFRONT ENDSFOR ROBUST SPEECH RECOGNIT IONPROGRAM SUMMARY*MODELRichard P. Lippmann, Principal InvestigatorLincoln Laboratory, M.I.T.Lexington, MA 02173- 9108PROGRAM GOALSThe purpose of this work is to integrate a number of audi-tory model front ends into a high-performance HMM recog-nizer, to test and evaluate these front ends on noisy speech,and to analyze the results in order to develop a more robustfront end which may combine features of a number of thecurrent auditory model-based systems.BACKGROUNDThis project was motivated by the need for improvedspeech recognition in noise, and by expectation that au-ditory model front ends could make recognition more ro-bust to noise, microphone variation, and speaking style.The project has focussed on implementing, evaluating, andcomparing three promising auditory front ends: (1) themean-rate and synchrony outputs of S. Seneff 'sauditorymodal; (2) the ensemble interval histogram (EIH) modeldeveloped by O. Ghitza; and (3) the IMELDA model dueto M. Hunt.
Additional comparisons have been carried outbetween baseline systems using mel-cepstra derived fromfilterbank and LPC analysis.RECENT ACCOMPL ISHMENTSThe three auditory models (Seneff, EIH and IMELDA) havebeen compared extensively among themselves and with a.mel-cepstrum front end for HMM isolated-word recogni-tion on the TI-105 isolated word corpus.
Conditions testedhave included additive white noise, additive speech babblenoise, and spectral variability due to microphone placement,channel, and acoustic recording environment.
The best re-sults from the auditory models were shown to provide smallbut consistent improvement over mel-cepstrum under con-ditions of high noise and spectral variability.
These smallimprovements may not warrant he added complexity of theauditory models.Additional comparisons between mel-filterbank (MFB) andLPC-based cepstrum front ends were conducted, showingsignificant advantages for MFB in noise; the gain in movingfrom LPG to MFB was greater than the gain in movingfrom MFB to any of the auditory models.

Theseresults were confirmed at other sites.As yet, no improvements have been achieved with the au-ditory models.PLANSPlans include: (1) further investigation ofdimension ality re-duction using principal components and linear discriminantanalysis, and (2) completion of the CSR resource manage-ment tests on the auditory models.399
