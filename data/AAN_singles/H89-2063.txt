A Microphone Array System for Speech RecognitionHarvey F. SilvermanDivision of EngineeringBrown UniversityProvidence, RI 02912The ultimate speech recognizer cannot use an attached or desk-mounted microphone.Array techniques offer the opportunity to free a talker from microphone incumberance.My goal is to develop algorithms and systems for this purpose.In the past year, we have studied the microphone-array placement problem andcome up with some optimal placements for a linear microphone array.
In so doing wehave developed a new method for general nonlinear optimization which we call theStochastic Region Contraction method.
This allowed us to get optimal solutions to ourproblem -- globally optimal -- in far less time than simulated annealing would havetaken.We also built a first system for studying linear arrays.
The hardware uses oneTMS32025 per microphone channel and feeds our parallel processor, Armstrong.Using this facility, we are able to do both time and frequency-domain beam forming,and are able to gather real data from the multiple microphone sources.
Currently,we have eight channels and are building another eight.Current work and work in trhe immediate future includes much on the trackingalgorithms.
We are currently testing two on both synthetic and our real data.
The firstapplies an interpolative correlation technique, to which a stage of "hyperbolic fit" isadded.
This fit is accomplished via gradient echniques.
The second applies stochasticregion contraction to maximize the power over a parametefized spectrum as well as thesource location.
In addition, we are hypothesizing new architectures and measuringthe real effects the real environment.447
