Resources Report on Languages of IndonesiaHammam RizaIPTEKNETAgency for the Assessment andApplication of Technology (BPPT)Jakarta, Indonesiahammam@iptek.net.idAbstractIn this paper, we report a survey of lan-guage resources in Indonesia, primarily ofindigenous languages.
We look at the offi-cial Indonesian language (Bahasa Indone-sia) and 726 regional languages of Indone-sia (Bahasa Nusantara) and list all theavailable LRs that we can gathered.
Thispaper suggests that the smaller regionallanguages may remain relatively unstudied,and unknown, but they are still worthy ofour attention.
Various LRs of these endan-gered languages are being built and col-lected by regional language centers forstudy and its preservation.
We will alsobriefly report its presence on the Internet.1 IntroductionIt is not hard to get a picture of just how linguisti-cally diverse Indonesia is.
There are 726 languagesin the country; making it the world?s second mostdiverse, after Papua New Guinea which has 823local languages (Mart?
et al, 2005:48).The languages of Indonesia are part of a com-plex linguistic situation that is generally seen ascomprised of three categories: Indonesian lan-guage, the regional indigenous languages, and for-eign languages.
(Alwi and Sugono, 2000).The indigenous languages of Indonesia - also re-ferred to as vernaculars or provincial languages,collectively called as Bahasa Nusantara - exhibitsgreat variation in numbers of speakers.
Thirteen ofthem have a million or more speakers, accountingfor 69.91% of the total population ?
Javanese(75,200,000 speakers), Sundanese (27,000,000),Malay (20,000,000), Madurese (13,694,000), Mi-nangkabau (6,500,000), Batak (5,150,000), Bugis-nese (4,000,000), Balinese (3,800,000), Acehnese(3,000,000), Sasak (2,100,000), Makasarese(1,600,000), Lampungese (1,500,000), and Rejang(1,000,000).
(Lauder, 2004: 3-4).
Of these 13 lan-guages, only 7 languages have presence on theInternet (Riza 2006).The remaining 713 languages have a total popu-lation of only 41.4 million speakers, and the major-ity of these have very small numbers of speakers.For example, 386 languages are spoken by 5,000or less; 233 have 1,000 speakers or less; 169 lan-guages have 500 speakers or less; and 52 have 100or less (Gordon, 2005).
These languages are facingvarious degrees of language endangerment (Crys-tal, 2000).There is evidence from census data over threedecades that the growth in the numbers of speakersof Indonesian is reducing the numbers of speakersof the indigenous languages (Lauder, 2005).
Con-cerns that this kind of growth would give Indone-sian the potential to replace the regional languageswere aired as early as the 1980s.
(Poedjosoedarmo,1981; Alisjahbana, 1984).2 Language ResourcesMany language centers in Indonesia have em-barked in various research and development increation of language resources (LRs).
Unfortu-nately, this development mainly only focused oncreating LRs for the official language Bahasa In-donesia.
In the followings, we describe the presentThe 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 200893and ongoing LRs research projects with emphasison the indigenous languages.2.1 Indonesian Electronic Dictionary System(KEBI)Our laboratory has worked to enlarge and improvethe quality of Indonesian electronic dictionaries.Starting 1987, it took us at least 4 years to developall necessary components for CICC-MMTS, result-ing with many first-ever Indonesian language re-sources, primarily electronic dictionaries andgrammar rules for language analysis and genera-tion.
This extension have resulted in a collection of500,000 word entries and more than 2 millionderivational and inflected words.
As part of thisresearch, we built an online access to the dictionar-ies (http://nlp.inn.bppt.go.id/kebi) enabling users toadd new words and definition.
KBBI electronicdictionary is scheduled to be launched in 2008,during 100 years celebration of the official BahasaIndonesia.2.2 BPPT-ANTARA CorpusThis parallel corpus was developed as extension toIndonesia National Corpus Initiative (INCI) whichwas earlier created to support the development of ahybrid stochastic-symbolic system BIAS-II.
Cur-rently, a pure statistical MT system based on Phar-aoh is developed by BPPT and National NewsAgency (ANTARA) using 500K sentences pair,expected to have better accuracy and robustnessand could enhance the quality of translation (cur-rent BLEU score 0.72).2.3 Regional Languages Mapping (NationalLanguage Center)For the past 15 years, the Indonesia National Lan-guage Center have been collecting information re-garding all indigenous languages.
By the end ofthis year, this project will be completed and all re-sult and findings will be open to public.2.4 Dictionaries of  Bahasa Nusantara, Indo-nesian Linguistics Association (MLI)Masyarakat Linguistik Indonesia (MLI) is a groupof institutions, organizations and corporation,working together on mutually defined goals andprojects that seek to provide a specification of  LRsof all languages of Indonesia.
MLI also help mem-bers to use the specification for tools and applica-tions; find the best means to disseminate the speci-fications, tools and applications and  encourage anopen standard-based approach to the creation andinterchange of LRs.
It also demonstrate how MLIcan be applied to Asian Language Resource (ALR)through making the results of collaborative en-deavors available throughout the members of  thegroup and wider associations; provide training,awareness and educational events and share witheach other their work on related issues.2.5 Speech CorpusIn a mission to improve the quality of automaticspeech recognition (ASR), a collaboration ofTelkom RDC and ATR-Japan has constructedspeakers?
corpus (40 speakers, 2000 sentences)which is expected to improve the accuracy of ASRto 90% level.2.6 Other CorpusOther monolingual corpus is found online.
Themajor news articles corpora on the web is Tem-pointerakif.com (56,471 articles).
Kompas corpus(71,109 articles) can be found athttp://ilps.science.uva.nl/Resources/BI.ReferencesAlisjahbana, S. T. 1984.
