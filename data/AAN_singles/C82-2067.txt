The pro jec t  has been planned as onecomposed of th ree  par ts .
A repor t  on the resu l t s  of part  I waspresented at  the F i f th  ICCH Conference in  Ann Arbor in  May1981.
The present  text  aims at  showing the main out l ines  ofthe approach app l ied  in  par t  I I .
To make some aspects  of thatpar t  c lear ,  however, cer ta in  re ferences  must be made to par t  IvPart  l l I  i s ,  as yet ,  at the eta~e of p re l iminary  d i scuss ions .2.
The genera l  approach app l ied  in  the whole of the pro-~eot i s  of  a semantic  k ind .
I t  has been assumed, in  par t i cu la r ,that  at  a cer ta in  leve l  of  genera l i za t ion  a l l  e lementary  ana-phor ic  c lauses  of the above c lass  ( le t  us ca l l  them the a -- c lauses)  have in  sp i te  of the d ivers i ty  of the i r  types ,  an- 273 -analogous semant ic  s t ruc ture ,  which can be represented  by thefollowing diagremzthe elementary a-clausethe anaphor ic  functor  the  argument of the anaphor ic  functorthe s tandard  the spec i f i ca t ionof  the argument of  the argumentConsider the following fictitious example of a legalprovision in which an elementary a-clause is inherent:"Art.
56.
In cases when the price is to be paid in casharticle 44 of the civil code should be applied.
"In art.
56 the a-functor is represented in the surface struct-ure by the phrase "should be applied", the argument by thephrase "article 44", the standard by the phrase "article" andthe specification by the phrase "44".
The role of the a-funot-or is confined to signalizin~ the fact that the clause inquestion has the illocutionary status of an anaphorlc utteran-ce, while that of the argument (and its immediate semanticoonstituens) consists in carrying information relevant toidentifying the referende of that clause.
Four types of theelementary a-clauses, in particular the type A (the explicit-ly addressing), the type D (the deictio), the type R (theimplicitly referrlng) and the type S (the semantic) are dis-tingulshed.
The distinction corresponds to four types ofindication met in the clauses in question.
By indication wemean the way in which referends of the a-clause are referredto  by i t .3- The operat ion  of  automated reso lv ing  of  an a -c lausecan be conce ived of  as composed of four  s tages .
