THE LOCKHEED MARTIN TIPSTER II PROJECTSteven MaioranoOffice o f  Research & DevelopmentWashington,  D.C. 20505E-mail:  smaioran@ord.govTelephone:  703-351-2701IntroductionThe Lockheed Martin TIPSTER II projectfocused on several research areas.
In addition, threedemonstration projects are underway to exhibit thefeasibility of transitioning the research into anoperational setting.in text together with a set of tools for easilyconstructing recognizers for new objects.
In addition,the group has advanced the state of the art foridentifying co-referential noun phrases.
This workwas evaluated during MUC-6 and performed extremelywell.
The ability to resolve co-references provides asound basis for all forms of link analysis \[1\]TIPSTER II Research AreasLockheed Martin's research accomplishmentswere threefold:1.
They defined a methodology for constructingdomain-specific extraction systems in a cost-effective,reliable way.
The MUC-6 evaluation system for thescenario template was constructed in three personweeks from the genetic system and performed verywell.2.
They provided insight into the benefit ofparticular techniques for integrating extraction anddetection technology through aseries of experimentalresults.
The best of these experimental techniqueswill be integrated in the joint Lockheed Martin/GECR&D/NYU/Rutgers ubmissions for TREC-5.3.
They contributed to defining a TIPSTERarchitecture, testing it, and implementing a multi-platform version of the document manager defined bythe architecture.
The document manager specifies aset of functions that should be used to get text fortext processing and to store the output of textprocessing.
Conforming to the TIPSTER architectureallows various extraction and detection modules towork together.The Generic Extraction SystemTo accomplish the goal of providing acore extractioncapability that can be easily customized to a particulardomain, Lockheed Martin developed a genetic textprocessing system.
The genetic system incorporatestheir research in identifying a range of basic entitiesI This material has been reviewed by the CIA.
That review neither \[constitutes CIA authentication of information nor implies CIA Iendorsement of the author's views.
\[The Integration of Detection andExtractionA range of experiments were performed here tointegrate xtraction capabilities into the SMARTretrieval system.
This work was performed jointlywith GE CR&D \[2\] and shows promising results forlarge-scale integration; The work will be integratedfor the TREC-5 evaluation.In addition, a range of experiments wereperformed to extend previous classification results \[3\]to routing, and to compare the resulting system withthose used in TREC-4.
The comparison will bedescribed in the full paper and the results will beincorporated into a submission for the TREC-5routing systems \[4\]The Architecture Working GroupLockheed Martin has participated in theArchitecture Working Group (AWG), and provided atestbed of the architecture functions being definedthroughout the course of the contract.
LockheedMartin has implemented a document manager thataccesses documents stored in a variety of databases.They have both a PC and Sun version at this time,and currently access information stored in eitherSybase or Oracle.
The NMSU document manager wasalso integrated into the Lockheed Martin textprocessing system (NLToolset) in a flexible way thatwill allow other document managers to be includedeasily.47The Demonstration Projects SummaryADEPTThe Advanced Data Extraction and Preparation viaTipster (ADEPT) Program is a demonstration projectaimed at alleviating problems currently being faced bythe Office of Information Resources (OIR).
OIR hasbeen chartered to implement enterprise-wide systemsto collect, archive, distribute, and manage informationobtained from unclassified ata sources typicallycalled "Open Sources" \[5\].CANISThe Cable Abstracting and Indexing System Programis aimed at providing assistance to governmentanalysts in indexing and abstracting their cable traffic.The goal of the project is to reduce the amount ofmanual time that an analyst will spend reviewing andprocessing each cable \[6\]FTMThe Free Text Management project is ademonstration system that will be located in theFederal Intelligent Document UnderstandingLaboratory (FIDUL); the project will includeTIPSTER detection and extraction tools integratedwith a common document manager.Overall, Lockheed Martin has demonstratedimprovements in the technology to process texts andto do extraction, the ability to move the research intoa realistic setting, and the ability to develop systemsconforming to the architecture.References\[1\] Childs, L.; "An Evaluation of CoreferenceResolution Strategies for Acquiring AssociatedInformation;" in this volume.\[2\] Guthrie, L., Strzalkowski, T., Fang Lin, andJin Wang; "Integration of Document Detection andInformation Extraction;" in this volume.\[3\] Guthrie, L., Walker, E., and Guthrie, J.;"Document Classification by Machine: Theory andPractice;" in Proceedings of the 16th InternationalConference on Computational Linguistics (COLING.~.
