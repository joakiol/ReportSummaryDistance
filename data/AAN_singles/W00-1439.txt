Only lexicalmeaning components, necessary in any case for interpretation, can project structure.
In ourapproach, the lexicon is not a separate level of representation with its own restrictions; weoffer a structural account for what has hitherto been accounted for in terms of argument(number) specification, theta-roles, and mapping conditions.Each lexical semantic omponent projects a V-complement s ructure, the complementtypically realizing the categorical type of the component, as shown:V V V/ \ / \ /V N V A VI I IVM VS VLM = manner/means/instrument\ S = stateP L = locationThe full projections correspond roughly to the Vendler-Dowty aspectual classes:process/ change-of-state/activity achievementcause + change of state/accomplishmentV VI \ I \ ID V D VI / \  / \  I \Jane V N the vase V AI I I Ilaugh \[laugh\]M break \[break\]s\[break\].V/DI /Jane V/\[break\]MI\V\V/ \D V\ / \the vase V AI Ibreak \[break\]sProjection is free.
Transitivity thus follows from the number of projected meaningcomponents and crucially from the availability of an interpretation for each component in aparticular projection.Unprojected components are aspectually defocussed (backgrounded) and are interpreted asmodifiers.
Such aspectual defocussing also accounts for the variety of constructions in whichdifferent verbs can occnr, e.g.
the contrast between break and cut, which does not allow *Thecake cut.We demonstrate how a combination of semantic omponent projection and aspectual focusaccounts for the possibilities of verbal distribution and interpretation.272
