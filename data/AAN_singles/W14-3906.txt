While code switchinghas been studied extensively in formal andspoken contexts, its behavior and preva-lence remains unexamined in many newerforms of electronic communication.
Thepresent study examines code switching inTwitter, focusing on instances where anauthor writes a post in one language andthen includes a hashtag in a second lan-guage.
In the first experiment, we per-form a large scale analysis on the lan-guages used in millions of posts to showthat authors readily incorporate hashtagsfrom other languages, and in a manualanalysis of a subset the hashtags, revealprolific code switching, with code switch-ing occurring for some hashtags in overtwenty languages.
In the second experi-ment, French and English posts from threebilingual cities are analyzed for their codeswitching frequency and its content.1 IntroductionOnline platforms enable individuals from a widevariety of linguistic backgrounds to communi-cate.
When individuals share multiple languagesin common, their communication will occasion-ally include linguistic elements from multiple lan-guages (Nilep, 2006), a practice commonly re-ferred to as code switching.
Typically, during codeswitching, the text or speech in a language retainsits syntactic and morphological constraints for thatlanguage, rather than having text from both lan-guages conform to one of the language?s grammat-ical rules.
This requirement enables code switch-ing to be separated from borrowing, where foreignwords are integrated into a native language?s lexi-con and morphology (Gumperz, 1982; Poplack etal., 1988; Sankoff et al., 1990).While work on code switching began with con-versational analyses, recent work has examinedthe phenomena in electronic communication, find-ing similar evidence of code switching (Climentet al., 2003; Lee, 2007; Paolillo, 2011).
How-ever, these investigations into code switching havelargely examined interpersonal communication orsettings where the number of participants is lim-ited.
In contrast, social media platforms such asTwitter offer individuals the ability to write a textthat is decoupled from direct conversation but maybe read widely.Twitter enables users to post messages with spe-cial markers known as hashtags, which can serveas a side channel to comment on the post itself(Davidov et al., 2010).
As a result, multilingualauthors have embraced using hashtags from lan-guages other than the language of their post.

#failHere, the first author posted in English with aSpanish hashtag reflecting the author?s enviousdisposition.
In the second, the author commentsin German on sensible food, using multiple En-glish hashtags to describe the meal and their atti-tude.
In the third and fourth, the authors comment51on sleep and school, respectively, and then eachuse hashtags with similar meanings in both theirnative language and English.Hashtags provide authors with a communica-tion medium that also has broader social utilityby embedding their post within global discussionof other posts using the same hashtag (Letierce etal., 2010) or by becoming a part of a virtual com-munity (Gupta et al., 2010).
These social motiva-tions resemble those seen for why individuals maycode switch, such as to assimilate into a group ormake discussions easier (Urciuoli, 1995).
Twit-ter and other hashtag-supporting platforms such asInstagram and Facebook offer a unique setting forcode switching hashtags for two reasons: (1) po-tential readers are disconnected from the author,who may not know of their language fluency, and(2) text translation is built into the platform, whichenables readers to translate a post into their na-tive language.
As such, authors may be motivatedto include a hashtag of another language to in-crease their potential audience size or to appear asa member of a multilingual virtual community.Despite the prevalence of non-English tweets,which are approaching 50% of the total volume(Liu et al., 2014), no study has examined theprevalence of hashtag code switching.
We pro-pose an initial study of hashtag code switching inTwitter focusing on three central questions: (1)for which language pairs do authors write in thefirst language and then incorporate a hashtag ofthe second language, (2) when tweets include ahashtag of a different language, which instancessignal code switching behavior, and (3) the degreeto which bilingual populations code switch hash-tags.
Here, we adopt a general definition of codeswitching as instances where an individual estab-lishes a linguistic context in one language andthen includes elements (such as words) from oneor more other languages different from the first.Two experiments are performed to answer thesequestions.
In the first, we test general methods toidentify which languages adopt the same hashtagsand whether those shared hashtags are examples ofcode switching.
In the second, we focus on threebilingual cities to examine hashtag code switchingbehavior in French and English speakers.Our study provides three main contributions.First, we demonstrate that hashtag code switchingis widespread in Twitter.
Second, we show thatTwitter as a platform includes multiple phenom-ena that can be falsely interpreted as code switch-ing and therefore must be accounted for in futureanalyses.
Third, in a study of French and Englishtweets from three cities, we find that an increasedrate of bilinguality decreases the frequency of in-cluding hashtags from another language but in-creases the overall rate of code switching whensuch hashtags are present.
Furthermore, all datafor the experiments is made publicly available.2 Related WorkResearch on code switching is long standing, withmany theories proposed for the motivations be-hind code switching and how the two languagesinteract linguistically (Poplack and Sankoff, 1984;Myers-Scotton, 1997; Auer, 1998).
Most relatedto the present work are those studies examiningcode switching in online communications.Climent et al.
(2003) examined the use of Span-ish and Catalan in newsgroups, finding it occurs2.2% and 4.4% of the Catalan and Spanish con-texts, respectively.
Lee (2007) analyzed a cor-pus of Cantonese and English emails and ICQinstant messages and surveyed Hong Kong usersof each form of communication.
She found thatthe users preferred mixed-language communica-tion, with no user indicating that they communi-cated in only Cantonese.
Furthermore, the shorter,more informal ICQ messages were more likely tobe code switched (99.4%) than emails (41.3%).Paolillo (2011) measured code switchingamongs English, Hindi, and Punjabi in bothIRC and Usenet forum posts, finding similarto Climent et al.
(2003) that the shorter, moreconversational IRC posts had higher rates ofcode switching.
Paolillo (2011) also note thatcode switching rates differed between Hindi andPunjabi speakers.The present work differs significantly fromthese three studies in two aspects.
First, we as-sess code switching across all language commu-nities on Twitter, rather than examining individualgroups of bilingual speakers.
Second, we focusour analysis only on the code switching of a post?shashtag due to its unique role in microtext (Guptaet al., 2010), which has yet to be examined in thiscontext.3 Hashtag Use in TwitterHashtags provide general functionality on Twit-ter and prior works have proposed that they serve52Name Description ExamplesANNOTATION Serves as an annotation about the author?s feelings or commentson the content of a tweet.#happy #fail #cute #joking#YoloSwagginsCOMMUNITY A topical entity that links the tweet with an external community,which is commonly topical but also includes ?team-like?

However,the diverse user base of the Twitter platform hasgiven rise to additional roles for hashtags beyondthese two.
For example, many popular hashtagsfocus on promoting users to follow each other,1such as #followback and #openfollow.
Similarly,contests are run on Twitter, which have individu-als vote by posting using a specific hashtag, e.g.,#MtvHottest.Given hashtags?
flexible roles, some may beused in multiple languages without being exam-ples of code switching, such as the contest-basedor follower-promotion hashtags noted above.Therefore, we first propose a taxonomy for clas-sifying all types of hashtags according to their pri-mary observed use in order to disentangle poten-tial code switching behavior from Twitter-specificbehavior.
To construct the taxonomy, two an-notators independently reviewed several thousandhashtags of different frequency to assess the dif-ferences in how the tag was used in practice.
Eachannotator then proposed their own taxonomy.
Thefinal taxonomy was produced from a discussion ofdifferences, with both annotators initially propos-ing highly similar taxonomies.21In Twitter, following denotes creating a directional socialrelation from one account to another.2We note that a small number of hashtags did not fit thistaxonomy due to their idiosyncratic use.
These hashtags weretypically single-letter hashtags used when spelling out words,e.g., ?tonight is going to be #f #u #n,?

The first twotypes of hashtags correspond to the main hash-tag roles proposed in Yang et al.
(2012).
TheNAMED ENTITY tags also serve as method forindividuals to link their content with a specificaudience like the COMMUNITY type; however,NAMED ENTITY tags were treated as a separategroup for the purposes of this study because theentities typically have a common name which isused in all languages and therefore would not betranslated; in contrast, COMMUNITY hashtags re-fer to more general topics such as #soccer, whichmay be translated, e.g., #futbol.
Hashtags of thefive remaining types would likely not be observedin instances of code switching, with such hash-tags often being used for purposes other than inter-personal communication.4 Experiment 1: Popular HashtagsPersistently popular hashtags reflect establishednorms of communication on Twitter.
We hypoth-esize that these hashtags may be adopted by thespeakers of multiple languages for joining a globaldiscussion.
Therefore, the first experiment ex-amines the most-used hashtags over a five monthperiod to measure two aspects: (1) which lan-guages adopt the hashtags of other languages and(2) which hashtags used in multiple languages areevidence of code switching.ter?s definition of a hashtag, e.g., ?#I?mAwesome,?
which hasthe hashtag #I rather than the full expression.534.1 Experimental SetupData Hashtag frequencies were calculated from981M tweets spanning March 2014 to July 2014.Frequencies were calculated over this five monthperiod in order to focus on widely-used hashtags,rather than bursty hashtags that are popular onlyfor a short time, such as those studied in Huanget al.
(2010) and Lin et al.
(2013).
For each hash-tag, up to 10K non-retweet posts containing thathashtag were retained, randomly sampling fromthe time period studied when more than 10K wereobserved.
To enable a more reliable estimate ofthe language distribution, we restrict our analysisto only those hashtags with more than 1000 posts,for a total number of 19.4M posts for 4624 hash-tags, with an average of 4204 posts per hashtag.Language Identification The languages oftweets were identified using a two-step procedure.First, message content was filtered to remove con-tent such as usernames, URLs, emoji, and hash-tags.
Tweets with fewer than three remaining to-kens were excluded (e.g., a message with onlyhashtags).
Second, the remaining content wasprocessed using langid.py (Lui and Baldwin,2012), a state of the art language identificationprogram that supports the diversity of languagesfound on Twitter.Determining the language of a hashtag in a gen-eral setting for all languages is difficult due to thepresence of acronyms, abbreviations, and slang.Therefore, we adopt a heuristic where a hashtag?slanguage is set as the language used by the major-ity of its tweets.
To quantify the accuracy of thisheuristic, two annotators inspected the tweets of200 hashtags to identify the language of the hash-tag and for the majority of the tweets.
This anal-ysis showed that the heuristic correctly identifiesthe hashtag?s language in 96.5% of the instances.4.2 Hashtag Sharing by LanguagesThe adoption of a hashtag by a second languagewas measured by calculating the frequency withwhich tweets using a hashtag with language l1were labeled with language l2.
The noisy natureof microtext is known to make language identifi-cation difficult (Bergsma et al., 2012; Goldszmidtet al., 2013) and can create spurious instancesof second-language hashtag adoption.
Therefore,we impose a minimum frequency of hashtag usewhere l2is only said to use a hashtag of l1if atleast 20 tweets using that hashtag were labeledHashtag # Langs.

To quantify the accuracy of our hashtagadoption measure, two annotators inspected thesecond-language tweets of 200 hashtags, sampledfrom the data and representing 40 language paircombinations; this analysis showed that with thefiltering the assertion that at least one author fromlanguage l1used a hashtag of language l2was cor-rect in 67% of the instances.Table 2 shows the frequency with which au-thors using the 15 most-commonly observed lan-guages (shown as columns using their ISO 639-1language codes) adopt a hashtag from another ofthe most-common languages (shown as rows), re-vealing widespread sharing of hashtags betweenlanguages.
English hashtags are the most fre-quently used in other languages, likely due to it be-ing the most common language in Twitter.
How-ever, other languages?
hashtags are also adopted,with Spanish, Japanese, and Indonesian being themost common after English.Despite the strong evidence of using of a sin-gle hashtag in multiple languages, the results inTable 2 should not be interpreted as evidence ofcode switching.
Table 3 shows the 15 hashtagsused in the most number of languages.
The ma-jority of these hashtags are generated by either(1) Twitter-based applications that automaticallywrite a tweet in a user?s native language and thenappend a fixed English-language hashtag or (2)spam-like accounts that use the same hashtag andinclude random text snippets in various languages,neither of which signal code switching behavior.Furthermore, given the noise introduced by lan-guage misidentification and spam behavior on the54Language of tweetde ru ko pt en it fr zh es ar th ja id nl trde 2 1 4 15 6 9 4 9 1 4 6 1ru 3 3 3 25 7 5 8 7 2 1 7 7 7 1ko 4 2 13 3 6 5 10 3 10 11 4 2pt 14 3 64 45 40 13 63 2 4 3 15 10en 1705 532 155 1235 1735 2183 1171 2482 362 176 742 1097 1101 342it 5 2 1 10 29 15 4 22 5 3 6 3 1fr 38 2 3 36 87 49 28 67 8 1 12 19 29 6zh 3 4 2 2 12 1 2 4 1 11 1 1es 67 17 3 321 435 264 206 105 29 5 32 66 66 31ar 6 2 38 4 9 6 7 8 5 1 2th 3 7 1 24 5 4 8 8 2 6 4 1ja 17 18 11 11 123 17 24 132 45 2 2 14 12 4id 84 2 6 25 131 88 58 14 92 6 5 11 52 17nl 13 1 3 17 6 11 2 9 1 1tr 17 1 3 28 9 7 7 13 3 1 22 9Table 2: The frequency with which a hashtag is used by multiple languages.
Columns denote the lan-guage in which the tweet is written; rows denote the hashtag?s language; and cell values report thenumber of hashtags where the column?s language has used the hashtag in at least 20 tweets.
Diagonalsame-language values are omitted for clarity.Twitter platform, we view the initial results in Ta-ble 2 an overestimate of hashtag adoption by lan-guages other than the hashtag?s source language.A further inspection of language classification er-rors revealed four common factors: (1) the lack ofaccents on characters,3(2) the use of short words,which appeared ambiguous to langid.py, (3)the use of non-Latin characters for emoticons orvisual affect, and (4) proper names originatingfrom a language different from the tweet?s.
Never-theless, the observed trends do provide some guid-ance as to which language pairs might share hash-tags and also may code switch.Among the hashtags in Table 3, two are legit-imately used by authors in multiple languages:#soccer and #GER, the latter corresponding to theGerman soccer team.
Both hashtags were populardue to the World Cup, which occurred during thetime period studied.
For both, authors includedthese hashtags while taking part in a global con-versation about the games and event.
The hashtag#soccer is a clear case of code switching, whereindividuals are communicating their interests inmultiple languages, even when equivalent hash-tags in the tweet?s language are actively beingused.
Indeed, over half of the languages using#football had at least one tweet containing both#football and #futbol.
The example of #GER high-lights a boundary case of code switching.
Here,GER is an abbreviation for the country?s name,making it a highly-recognized marker, rather than3In particular, the lack of character accents caused signif-icant difficulties in distinguish between Spanish and Catalan.an example of a language change that results incode switching; however, the country has differ-ent names depending on the language used (e.g.,Deutschland), which does point to an active choiceon an author?s part when selecting a particularname and its abbreviation.4.3 Analysis by Hashtag TypeIn a second analysis, we focus specifically onhashtags classified as COMMUNITY and ANNO-TATION, which are more associated with inten-tional communication actions and therefore morelikely to be used in instances of code switching.Performing such an analysis at scale would re-quire automated methods for classifying hashtagsby their use, which is beyond the scope of this ini-tial investigation.
Therefore, we performed a man-ual analysis of the 100 most-common, 100 least-common, and 100 median-frequency hashtags inour dataset to assess the distribution of hashtagtypes and cases of code switching among theCOMMUNITY and ANNOTATION hashtags.
Twoannotators labeled each hashtag, achieving 64.6%agreement on the type annotations; disagreementswere largely due to mistaken assignments ratherthat disputed classifications.4An adjudication stepresolved all disagreements.
Additionally, elevenhashtags were excluded from analysis due beingmade of common words (e.g., #go, #be) which had4In particular, mistakes were more common when analyz-ing hashtags used in languages outside the annotators?

Fol-lowing, we describe the results of the analysis andthen highlight several types of hashtags.Figure 1 shows the distribution of hashtag typesobserved in the three samples.
SPAM and AP-PLICATION hashtags were most common amonghighest frequency hashtags, whereas the low-est frequency tags in the dataset were also ei-ther SPAM or VOTING.
Surprisingly, the me-dian frequency hashtags had the majority of thediscussion-related hashtag typesWithin the ANNOTATION and COMMUNITYtypes, we selected thirteen hashtags each to man-ually evaluate if code switching behavior was ob-served.
For each hashtag, two annotators reviewedall associated tweets that were identified as usinga different language than that of the hashtag.
An-notators were instructed to consider the tweet aninstance of code switching only in cases where(1) there was sufficient text to determine the mes-sage?s actual language and (2) the message was anact of communication (in contrast to spam-like ornonsensical messages).Code switching behavior was observed foreleven of the ANNOTATION hashtags and twelveof the COMMUNITY hashtags.
Table 4 showsthose code switched hashtags and the languagesin which they were seen, highlighting the varyingfrequency with which hashtags were used in multi-ple languages.
For example, the primarily Arabichashtag #Hadith was used in English and Dutchtweets; similarity, all three Spanish hashtags wereused in English tweets.Many hashtags are used primarily with lan-guages that are associated with countries knownHashtag Lang.

How-ever, several hashtags were used in a variety ofdiverse languages.
For example, #truth was usedwith languages such as Arabic, Bosnian, Bulgar-ian Hindi, and Punjabi.
The most widely codeswitched hashtag was #magic.
In English, thehashtag is commonly used with content on magictricks; however, in other languages, the hashtagoften connotes surprise.
For example, the Lat-vian tweet ?Es izmekl?eju visu plauktu, nekur nav.Mamma piejiet ne sekunde nepag?aja, kad vin?aatrada.
#magic?
comments on having an item onthe shelf disappear when looking for it, only for itto reappear like magic.During annotation, we observed that authorswere highly productive in their code switching, us-ing these hashtags to generate the types of emo-tional and sarcastic messages typically seen insame-language messages.
For example, in theSwedish tweet ?Bussen luktar spya och ?ol.
#fresh?the author is sarcastically commenting on a bus56that smells of vomit and beer.4.4 DiscussionThe process of annotating code switching forhashtags revealed four notable trends in author be-havior that occurred with multiple hashtags.
First,authors fluent in non-Latin writing systems willoften use Latin-transliterated hashtags, which arethen adopted by authors of Latin-based systems.For example, the hashtag #aikatsu describes a col-lectible card game and anime and is heavily usedby both Japanese and English authors.
Similar-ity, the transliterated hashtags #Hadith and #Quranare commonly associated with Arabic-languagetweets, which rarely include an Arabic-script ver-sion of those hashtags even when the tweets in-clude other hashtags in Arabic.Second, when two or more languages share thesame written form of a word (i.e., homographs),the resulting hashtags become conflated and ap-pear as false examples of code switching.
For ex-ample, #Real was widely used in both English andSpanish, but with two meanings: the English us-ages denoting something existent (i.e., not fake)and the Spanish usages referring to Real MadridFC, a soccer club.
The hashtag #cine also poseda challenge due to abbreviation.
While manySpanish-language tweets include #cine (cinema),tweets in other languages include #cinema and itsabbreviated form #cine, which matches the Span-ish term, creating false evidence of code switch-ing.Third, multilingual individuals may adopt acommon hashtag for reasons other than codeswitching, which we highlight with two examples.The hashtag #1DWelcomeToBrazil is used in alarge number of English and Portuguese tweets.This hashtag is associated with the travel arrivalof the English-speaking band One Direction toBrazil.
Similarly, the #100happydays hashtag wasspawned from a movement where individuals de-scribe positive aspects of their day.
These globalphenomena increases the difficulty of automati-cally identifying code switching instances.Fourth, spam accounts will occasionally latchonto a hashtag and use it in a variety of languages.For example, the popular hashtag #1000ADAY isused to attract new followers, which resulted inadult content services also using the hashtag topost spam advertisements.
Surprisingly, nearlya third of tweets for this hashtag are in Russianand feature fully-grammatical text that appears tobe randomly sampled from other sources, such aslists of proverbs.
After examining multiple ac-counts, we speculate that these messages are actu-ally bot accounts who need to generate sufficientnumber of messages to avoid Twitter?s spam fil-ters.
Work on detecting fake accounts has largelybeen done in English (Benevenuto et al., 2010;Grier et al., 2010; Ghosh et al., 2012) and so maybenefit from detecting this cross-lingual hashtaguse in accounts.5 Experiment 2: Bilingual CitiesThe second experiment measures the prevalenceof hashtag code switching in tweets from threecities with different populations of English andFrench speakers: Montreal, Canada, Quebec City,Canada and Paris, France.
All three cities areknown to contain bilingual speaker as well, whohave been shown to actively code switch (Heller,1992).
To test for differences in the code switch-ing behavior of populations, each city is analyzedaccording to the degree to which Anglophoneand Francophone speakers incorporate hashtagsof other languages into their tweets and whethertranslations of the code switched hashtags are usedin the original language.5.1 Experimental SetupData Tweets were gathered for each city by us-ing the method of Jurgens (2013) to identify Twit-ter users with a home location within each city?sgreater metropolitan area.
Tweets were then ex-tracted for these users over a three year sample of10% of Twitter.
This process yielded 4.4M tweetsfor Montreal, 203K for Quebec City, and 58.1Mfor Paris.
For efficiency, we restricted the Parisdataset to 5M tweets, randomly sampled across thetime period.Language Identification The language of atweet was identified using a similar process as inExperiment 1.
Because this setting restricts theanalysis to only English and French, a differentmethod was used to determine the language of ahashtag.
Given a tweet in language l1, the text ofa hashtag is tested to see if it wholly occurs withinthe dictionary for l1; if not, a greedy tokenizationalgorithm is run to attempt to split a hashtag intoconstituent words that are in the dictionary of l1.

Other-wise, the tests are repeated with the second lan-guage l2.
If the hashtag cannot be recognized inl1or l2, it is assumed to be in the language of itstweet.
The aspell dictionaries were used to rec-ognize words.
Furthermore, after analyzing the er-rors made due to missing words, dictionaries wereaugmented to include common social media termsin each language (e.g., ?selfie?).
A manual anal-ysis of 100 hashtags each for French and Englishshowed that this language assignment method wascorrect for 91% of the instances.5.2 ResultsFrancophone authors were much more likely touse English hashtags than Anglophone authorswere for French hashtags.
For tweets in each lo-cale and language, Figure 2 shows the percentagecontaining a hashtag in the other language relativeto the total number in that city using a hashtag ineither language.
Notably, Paris has a higher rate ofusing English hashtags than both Canadian cities.We speculate that this difference is due to the highrate of bilingualism in Montreal and Quebec City;because authors are fully fluent in both languages,should Francophone authors need to express them-selves with an English hashtag, they may write theentire tweet in English, rather than code switch-ing.
In contrast, Parisian authors are less likely tobe fully fluent in English (though functional) andtherefore express themselves primarily in Frenchwith English hashtags as desired.
An analogoustrend may be seen for French hashtags in the En-glish tweets from Montreal, which has a higherpopulation of primarily Anglophone speakers whomight be less willing to communicate entirely inFrench but will still use French hashtags to con-nect their content with the dominant language usedin the city.For each language and city, Table 5 showsthe ten most popular hashtags incorporated intotweets of the other language.
Examining the mostpopular English tags in French tweets shows aclear distinction in the two populations; FrenchParisian tweets include more universal Englishhashtags or those generated by applications, whichare not generally instances of code switching.
Incontrast, the Canadian cities include more AN-NOTATION type hashtags, including the sarcasm-marking #not, which are more indicative of codeswitching behavior.An established linguistic convention within apopulation can also motivate authors to preferone language?s expression over another (Myers-Scotton, 1997).
To test whether a high-frequencyconcept was equally expressed in French and En-glish or whether one language?s expression waspreferred, we created pairs of equivalent Englishand French hashtags expressing the same con-cept (e.g., #happy/#heureux) by translating the50 most-popular English hashtags used in Frenchtweets.
Then, the tweets for each city were an-alyzed to identify which languages were used inexpressing each concept as a hashtag.
The resultsin Figure 3 reveal that for nearly half of the hash-5801020304050MontrealQuebec CityParisHashtagcountEnglish onlyBoth Languages French OnlyFigure 3: For 50 most-common concepts ex-pressed in equivalent French and English transla-tions, the frequency with which the hashtags for aconcept were seen in each language.tags, equivalent French language versions are inuse; however, examining the relative frequenciesshows that in all cases, the English version is stillpreferred, despite the presence of a large Franco-phone population.
For hashtags that were onlyseen in English, many were of the COMMUNITYtype, e.g., #50factsaboutme, which may not havean equivalent French-language version.
However,we observed that when both an English hashtagand its French translation were attested, the useof the English hashtag in French was most oftenan instance of code switching.
Hence, testing forthe presence hashtag translation pairs may serve asa helpful heuristic for identifying hashtags whoseuse signals code switching behavior.6 DiscussionTypically, code switching is distinguished fromthe related phenomena of borrowing by testingwhether the word is being fluently mixed intothe utterance instead of simply functioning as aloan word (Poplack, 2001).
Hashtags present aunique challenge for distinguishing between thetwo phenomena due their brief content and un-structured usage: a hashtag may occur anywherein a tweet and its general content lacks grammat-ical constraints.
Examining the hashtags seen inour study, we find evidence spanning both typesof uses.
Common hashtags such as #win or #failare widely recognized outside of English and theiruses could easily be interpreted instances of bor-rowing.
However, the complexity of other hash-tags gives the appearance that their uses go be-yond that of borrowing, e.g., #goingbacktoschoolin ?Nadie dijo que ser?
?a f?acil, pero c?omo cuestaestudiar despu?es de 4 a?nos de no tener nadaacad?emico cerquita #goingbacktoschool?
wherethe author is commenting on the difficulty of re-turning for a degree.
Still other posts includemultiple single-token hashtags from a second lan-guage, e.g., the earlier example of ?Jetzt gibt?s wasvern?unftiges zum essen!
#salad #turkey #lunch#healthy #healthylifestyle #loveit.?
Although indi-vidually these hashtags may be widely recognizedand operate as interlingual markers, their com-bined presence suggests an intentional languageshift on the part of the author that could be inter-preted as code switching.
Together, the examplespoint to hashtag use by multiple languages as acomplex phenomena where shared hashtag enti-ties exist on a graded scale from simple borrow-ing to fully signaling code switching.
Our studyis intended as a starting point for analyzing thispractice and all our data is made available to sup-port future discussions on the roles these hashtagsplay and how they facilitate communication bothwithin and across language communities.7 ConclusionThe present work has provided an initial study ofcode switching in Twitter focusing on instanceswhere an author produces a message in one lan-guage and then includes a hashtag from a sec-ond language.
Our work provides three main con-tributions.
First, using state-of-the-art languageidentification techniques, we show that hashtagsare widely shared across languages, though thechallenges of correctly classifying the languageof tweets limits our ability to quantify the exactscale.
Second, in a manual analysis of ANNOTA-TION and COMMUNITY hashtags, we show thatauthors readily code switch with these types ofhashtags, using them just as they would in singlelanguage tweets (e.g., indicating sarcasm).
Third,in a case study of French and English tweets fromthree Francophone cities with bilingual speakers,we find that the cities with more bilingual speakerstended to have fewer occurrences English hashtagsin French tweets, which we speculate is due to au-thors being more likely to write such tweets en-tirely in English, rather than code switch; however,when English hashtags were observed in Frenchtweets from these more bilingual cities, they weremuch more likely to be used in instances of codeswitching.
Data for all of the experiments is59available at http://www.networkdynamics.org/datasets/.Our work raises several avenues for futurework.
First, we plan to examine how to improvelanguage identification in microtext in order togain a more accurate estimation of hashtag sharingand code switching rates for languages.
Second,the Twitter platform enables measuring additionalfactors that may influence an individual?s rate ofcode switching; specifically, we plan to investigate(1) a user?s historical tweets to estimate the degreeof bilinguality and (2) the impact of a user?s socialnetwork with respect to homophily and languageuse.ReferencesPeter Auer.
