An :Evaluation of a Method to :Detect and Correct ErroneousCharacters in Japanese input through an OCR using MarkovModelsTetsuo ArakiFukui University3-9-1 Bunkyo,Fukui-shi,JapanSatoru IkeharaNTT CommunicationScience Laboratories1-2356 Take,Yokosuka-shi, JapanAbstractThe "Selective Error Correction Method"to judge these three types of errors, andcorrect them, using ra-th order Markovchain model for Japanese 'kanji-kana' char-acters, has been proposed and shown to beuseful to detect and correct errors gener-ated randomly (Araki et al, 1994).In this paper, this method is applied todetect and correct erroneous characters inJapanese text input through an OCR.. Themethod is confirmed to be also elfective todetect and correct he errors introduced bythe OCR.1 Introduct ionIn order to improve the computers' man-machinetares'faces, input devices uch as Optical CharacterReaders(OCR.)
or speech recognition devices havebeen developed.
However, text input through anOCR or a speech recognition device usually containserroneous character strings.The erroneous characters can be classified intothree types.
The first is characters that have beenrecognized incorrectly, that is taken to be charactersother than the correct characters.
The second andthe third are extra characters wrongly inserted anddeleted (skipped) characters.
Markov chain modeLshave been used to find and correct he first type oferrors.Recently, the Selective Error Correction Methodto judge the three types of the errors and correctcorrect hese errors, using m-th order Markov chainmodel for Japanese 'kanji-kana' characters, has beenproposed (Arak iet  al., 1994).In this paper, the Selective Error CorrectionMethod is applied to detect and correct erroneouscharacters in Japanese text input through an OCR.Nobuyuki Tsukahara Yasunori KomatsuFukui University Fukui University3-9-1 Bunkyo, 3~9-1 Bunkyo,Fukui-shi, Japan Fukui-shi, Japan2 Experimental  Procedure andCondit ionsAn experimental procedure using the Selective ErrorCorrection Method for erroneous Japanese phrasesinput through OCR is described in Fig.1.Japanese "kanffi-kana.Bunsetsu DataOCRError Detect ion andCorrection procedureusing Markov ModelsFig.1.

The set ofcorrect Japanese phrases is represented by Fc.
Theset of erroneous phrases is denoted by FE, and itis further divided into three types: The first is er-roneous phrases which contain erroneous characterssubstituted wrongly in the phrase, and is denoted byFs.
The second and the third are erroneous phraseswhich have characters ommitted from them (denotedby FD) or inserted wrongly in them (denoted by FI).The accuracy ratios to detect and to correct theerrors by a method are evaluated by the "RelevanceFactor" P and the "Recall Factor" R. Here, P de-notes the ratio of errors detected or corrected by amethod to the whole of FE.
R denotes the ratio thatthe elements of FE can be detected or corrected bya method.Next, we introduce the following assumptionbased on previous experiments: "Each Markov prob-ability for erroneous chains o\] syllables and 'kanji-kana' characters is small compared to that of correctchains".According to this assumption, the procedure ofdetecting the location i and the length k of errorchains is defined as followed: Namely, the proceduredetects that k characters are wrongly substituted orinserted at the location i, if the m-th order Markovprobability for a chain remains maller than the crit-ical value T just (k + m) times from the location ito i+k+m-1.Similar),, the method of detecting the locationof a chain wrongly deleted in F~ ) and the meth-ods of correcting the chains with wrongly substi-tuted, inserted or deleted dlaracters are describedin Ref.
(Araki et al, 1994).4 Exper imenta l  Resu l ts  Us ingEr roneous  Japanese  Phrase  InputThrough OCR4.1 Exper imenta l  Resu l tsThe critical value of the 2nd-order Markov probabil-ity T was determined so as to make the value of Px R maximum for erroneou~ phrases.
The experi-mentM results are described as follows:\[1\] Error detection and error correction of correctphrasesAll of correct phrase are judged to be correct.\[2\] The Relation of P and R for erroneous phrasesThe maximum values of P and R for the locationof erroneous 'kanji-kana' character strings using er-ror detection procedures and those of the errors cor-reefed using error correction procedures, are as fol-lows: (1) p(D) = 79.0% R (D) = 74.5% (2) p(C) =66.2% R (c) = 84.6%p(D) The values of R(s/9) and "s  mean that thismethod can find 74.5% of the erroneous phrases Fs(substitution type), and 21.0% of the errors detectedby this method are errors detected wrongly.From these results, it is shown that the SelectiveError Correction Method using 2nd-order Markovmodels is useful to detect and correct erroneous char-acters substituted wrongly in text input through anOCR.4.2 Discuss ion\[1\] The characteristics of Erroneous Strings inputthrough OCR.Compared to the errors randomly generated(Araki et at., I994), the errors caused by OCRshowed high occurrence in the following four types oferrors: (1) mixed type (combination of three errortypes ), (2) errors located at the head and at endof phrases, (3) errors that length of an erroneousstring in a phrase is greater than 3, and (4) errorsdistributed within a phrase.\[2\] The comparison of the value of P and R for errordetection and error correction.The maximum values of P and R to detect andcorrect errors caused by an OCR are inferior to thatof errors generated randomly by 20-40%.The main reasons why the maximum values of Pand R are reduced can mainly be explained by tilecharacteristics of (2) and (4) above mentioned.However, regarding to (1) substitution errors, (2)errors located inside phrases, (3) errors of length 1and (4) errors connected in phrases, it is seen thatthe maximum values of P and R to detect and cor-rect errors by OCR, are nearly equal to those forerrors generated randomly.5 Conc lus ionIn this paper, the Selective Error Correction Methodproposed recently, is applied to detect and correct er-roneous characters wrongly substituted, deleted andinserted in Japanese text input using an OCR, themethod is shown to be effective, though the accu-racy ratios to detect and correct the OCR errors isinferior to those of random errors.Re ferencesT.Araki, S.Ikehara nd N.Tukahara.
