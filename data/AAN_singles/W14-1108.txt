In this work, we combineinformation filtering, grammar parsing andnetwork analysis for gene-disease associationextraction.
The proposed method first extractssentences potentially containing information aboutgene-diseases interactions based on maximumentropy classifier with topic features.
And thenProbabilistic Context?Free Grammars is appliedfor gene-disease association extraction.
Thenetwork of genes and the disease is constituted bythe extracted interactions, network centralitymetrics are used for calculating the importance ofeach gene.
We used breast cancer as testing diseasefor system evaluation.
The 31 top ranked genes anddiseases by the weighted degree, betweenness, andcloseness centralities have been checked relevancewith breast cancer through NCBI database.
Theevaluation showed 83.9% accuracy for the testinggenes and diseases, 74.2% accuracy for the testinggenes.1 IntroductionSince the start of Human Genome Project in1990, over 40 kinds of organism genome havebeen sequenced.
Biological databases expandrapidly with the exponential growth of biologicaldata.
For instance, until now, over 260,000named organisms have their nucleotidesequences in the GenBank (Benson et al.
2008)which integrates data from the major DNA andprotein sequence.
However, data is notinformation.
Compared with situations before2003, the key problem today has turned tomethods of knowledge extraction.
Understandingthe role of genetics in diseases is one of themajor goals of the post-genome era.
Theexpanding rate of knowledge in gene?diseaseassociations can hardly match up with the growthof biological data.
It takes time before newdiscoveries are included in the databases such asOnline Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM),and most of the information represented in thesedatabases is manually collected from literature.To address this challenge, we proposed anautomatic gene-disease association extractionapproach based on text mining and networkanalysis.
We combine information filtering,grammar parsing and network analysis.
Westarted by calculating main topics of eachsentences in the corpus based on supervisedLatent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA) model (Bleiand McAuliffe 2007).
The most probable topicsderived from sLDA model for each sentence areused as features for training maximum entropy(MaxEnt) (Manning and Schutze, 1999)classifier, which extracts sentences potentiallycontaining information about gene-diseasesinteractions.
After that, Probabilistic Context?Free Grammars (PCFGs) (Klein and Christopher2003) is applied for sentence grammar parsing.Based on the syntactic tree of each sentence, weextract paths between specific entities such asdiseases or genes.
The network of all candidategenes and the disease is constituted by theinteractions extracted from the sentences in thecorpus.
Our main hypothesis in network analysisis that the most important and the most centralgenes in an interaction network are most likely tobe related to the disease.
Last, network centralitymetrics are used for calculating the importanceof each gene.The rest of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2 surveys related work.
In Section 3, weintroduce the proposed approach of extractinginteractions from literature.
Section 4 presentsgene-disease interaction network analysis.
And54then Section 5 presents and discusses theexperimental results.
Lastly we conclude thispaper and discuss future work in Section 6.2 Related WorkMuch effort is currently spent on extractinggene?disease associations (?zg?r et al.
2008;Chun et al.
2006).
Biomedical relation extractiontechniques basically include two branches:interaction database based methods and textmining methods.
Interaction database basedmethods rely on the availability of interactiondatabases, such as OMIM, MINT (Zanzoni et al.2002), IntAct (Kerrien et al.
2012), BIND (Baderet al.
2003), which predict interactions betweenentities using sequence, structural, orevolutionary information (Krallinger, Leitner,and Valencia 2010).
Although these databaseshost a large collection of manually extractedinteractions from the literature, manually curateddatabases require considerable effort and timewith the rapid increasing of biomedical literature.Since most biological facts are available inthe free text of biomedical articles, the wealth ofinteraction information provided in biomedicalarticles motivated the implementation of textmining approaches to automatically extractbiomedical relations.
Text mining approaches togene?disease association extraction have shownan evolution from simple systems that rely solelyon co-occurrence statistics (Adamic et al.
2002;Al-Mubaid and Singh 2005) to complex systemsutilizing natural language processing techniquesand machine learning algorithms (Freudenbergand Propping 2002; Glenisson et al.
2004; ?zg?ret al.
2008).
Well-known tools for discoveringgene?disease associations include DAVID(Huang et al.
2009), GSEA (Subramanian et al.2005), GOToolBox (Martin et al.
2004), rcNet(Huang et al.
2011) and many others.
However,in many cases, since the existing annotations ofdisease-causative genes is far from complete(McKusick 2007), and a gene set might onlycontain a short list of poorly annotated genes,existing approaches often fail to reveal theassociations between gene sets and diseasephenotypes (Huang et al.
2011).Network-based approaches (Wuchty, Oltvai,and Barab?si, 2003; Schwikowski et al.
2000;Chen et al.
2006) is performed by assessing howmuch genes interact together and are close toknown disease genes in protein networks.Relation extraction among genes is thefundamental step for gene-interaction networkcreation.
Recently, syntactic analysis has beenconsidered for relation extraction, and differentparsing grammars have been applied.
Temkinand Gilder (2003) used a full parser with alexical analyzer and a context free grammar(CFG) to extract protein-protein interactions.
InYakushiji et al.
(2005)?s work, they proposed aprotein-protein interaction extraction systembased on head-driven phrase structure grammar(HPSG).
Although the pattern generation iscomplicated, the performance is not satisfactory.In addition, dependency grammar is usedfrequently in this domain.
Erkan et al.
(2007)proposed a semi-supervised classification forextracting protein interaction sentences usingdependency parsing.
Katrin et al.
(2007) definedsome rules based on dependency parse tree forrelation extraction.
The problem of those systemsusing dependency parse is that they cannot treatnon-local dependencies, and thus rules acquiredfrom the constructions are partial (Yakushiji et al.2005).
Differently, in this work, we applysentence filtering based on topics and phrasestructure parsing for relation extraction.
Theextracted sentences potentially containinformation about gene-diseases interactions.Phrase structure grammars are based on theconstituency relation, as opposed to thedependency relation associated with dependencygrammars.
Phrase structure parsing is fullparsing, which takes into account the fullsentence structure.In addition, many researches (Aerts et al.2005; Chen et al.
2009; Ma et al.
2007; Hutz et al.2008; Morrison et al.
2005; ?zg?r et al.
2008)used an initial list of seed genes to build adisease-specific gene-interaction network, andthus they are biased in favor of the seed genes,consequently the results also depend on thepickup seed genes.3 Extracting interactions fromliterature3.1 The CorpusWe used 44,064 articles from PubMed Central(PMC) Open Access which is a free full-textarchive of biomedical and life sciences journalliterature.
All articles were extracted by queryingthe keyword of ?breast cancer?.
We applied asegmentation tool Splitta for segmenting articlesinto sentences which includes propertokenization and models for high accuracy55sentence boundary detection with reported errorrates near 0.25% coded by Gillick (2009).A gene name dictionary was built fromOMIM database.
The disease name dictionarywas built based on Genetic Association Database(GAD) which is an archive of human geneticassociation studies of complex diseases anddisorders.3.2 Key sentences extractionWe applied MaxEnt classifier with topic featuresfor key sentences extraction.
The extractedsentences potentially contain information aboutgenes and breast cancer interactions.A Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modelwas used to infer topics of sentences.
Three mostprobable topics of each sentence were put intotrained MaxEnt classifier as features forextracting sentences that potentially containinteraction relationship between genes anddiseases.3.2.1 Key words annotationWe assume that each sentence indicatinginteractions should contain at least one gene andtarget disease name.
Key words are the wordsincreasing possibility of sentence containinginteraction relationships, such as genes anddiseases.
As mentioned above, we built the genename dictionary with data from OMIM databaseand disease name dictionary from GeneticAssociation Database (GAD).
All gene namesand disease names were considered as key words.3.2.2 Topic model based on Gibbs SamplingLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was appliedbased on Gibbs Sampling method in our system.Compared with algorithm obtaining approximatemaximum-likelihood estimates for topics-wordsdistribution and the hyperparameters of the prioron documents-topics distribution given by Blei,Ng and Jordan (2002), Gibbs Sampling methoddoesn?t need to explicitly represent the modelparameters which effect on the final results(Griffiths, 2002).For a word w  in a specific article, thepossibility it belongs to topic j  can be given by :( | , ) ( | , , ) ( | )?
?
?
?= ?
= =i i i i i i i iP z j z w P w z j z w P z j z  (1)whereiz  represents current topic, iz?represents all topics except for i , w representsall words in the article,iw  represents currentword andiw?
represents all words except for iw .Formula (1) could be represented as followafter derivation:( ) ( ),( )( ), ,( | , )?
??

?
?+ += ?+ +i iiw di ji i di j in nP z j z wn W n T    (2)where )(,??
jin  represents count of words belongto topic j  except for current word.
)( ,iwjin?represents count of word iw  belong to topic j  inthe article except for current one.
)( idn  representstotal of words in article id , while )( ,idin ??
representscount of words in document id  not including thecurrent one.
?
and ?
are hyperparameters thatdetermine extent of smooth of this empiricaldistribution, and how heavily this distributioncan be chosen to give the desired resolution inthe resulting distribution.
W  stands for count ofwords while T  stands for count of topics.3.2.3 Training of topic modelWe randomly selected sentences from 8000documents in our corpus as training set and setnumber of topics Kas 10.
Topic that contains mostwords in gene name dictionary and disease namedictionary was treated as a key topic.
Then wemanually assigned each word in gene namedictionary or disease name dictionary to keytopic, and each word doesn?t belong to the twodictionaries was assigned to the most probabletopic of itself.3.2.4 Prediction of key sentencesThe sentences containing interactions amonggenes or diseases were marked as ?Key?
andothers were marked as ?None?.
A MaxEntclassifier 1  was trained based on the topicdistribution.3.3 Extracting interactions from keysentencesIn order to extract interactions from sentences,we used phrase structure parsing which generatesparse tree of a sentence that can be analyzed forrelationships among words.
Stanford parser tool2(de Marneffe et al.
2006) is employed forsentence parsing.
Figure 1 shows an example ofphrase structure parse tree.We extracted interactions by depth-firstsearch in the parse tree.
Each path betweenkeyword nodes (e.g.
gene or disease) and the rootnode were collected.
A list of interaction verbs1 http://morphix-nlp.berlios.de/manual/node36.html2 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-dependencies.shtml56were compiled from VerbNet3, which consists of1048 verbs.
We captured interactions from thepaths which contain an interaction verb.Figure 1.
Part of the phrase structure parse tree ofthe sentence ?AA, an inhibitor of p300, can suppressAR and its target genes, which can induce cells cyclearrest and apoptosis of Lncap cells through ARsignaling.
?For instance, two genes ?AA?
and ?AR?
couldbe extracted from sentence ?AA, an inhibitor ofp300, can suppress AR and its target genes,which can induce cells cycle arrest and apoptosisof Lncap cells through AR signaling?.
The pathfrom ?AA?
to ?AR?
in the syntactic tree is?NP(AA) ->NP ->NP ->S ->VP(can) ->VP(suppress) ->NP ->NP ->NP(AR)?, where?suppress (VP)?
is an interaction verb.
Therefore,we consider there is a ?suppression?
interactionbetween ?AA?
and ?AR?.4 Interaction network analysisThe extracted interactions can be represented byan adjacency matrix, where1, =jiAif there is anedge between node i  and j , and0, =jiAif thereis no edge between node i  and j .
We establishdisease-specific interaction network throughsearching for nodes within 3 distance unit fromthe target disease node.
To gain the most relatedgene of the target disease, Centrality approach isused for calculating correlation of each genebased on its weight in this specific diseasenetwork.4.1 Degree centralityDegree centrality represents central tendency ofeach node in the network, the more directconnects it has, the more power it has in thenetwork and so the more important it is.
Thedegree centrality )(vCD  of node v  is calculatedas follows.3 http://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/verbnet.html?==njijD AvC1)(                         (3)4.2 Betweenness centralityBetweenness centrality reflects the ability of anode taking control of other nodes?communication and the capability of controllingresources in the network.
The more nodes thatshortest paths pass through, the morecommunications of other nodes depend on it, andthe more betweenness centrality the node has.The betweenness centrality )(vCB  of node v  iscalculated as follows:???

Thecloseness centrality of a node measures howclose it is to other nodes in the whole network.The smaller the total distance from a node toother nodes in the network, the less dependencythe node has on nodes in the network, and thusthe higher its centrality is.

All articles were extractedfrom PMC with keyword of ?breast cancer?
(search date: March 1 2013).
The gene namedictionary consists of 19,195 gene namessearched from OMIM database while the diseasedictionary consists of 5644 disease names fromGenetic Association database (GAD).5.1 Evaluation on key sentence extractionMaxEnt classifier is applied with topic featuresfor key sentences extraction.
We randomlyselected sentences from 8000 documents in ourcorpus as training set.
We set number of topicsK  as 10.

Differentcolor and size indicate different degree centralityof each node.
The node in red with the largestdegree centrality 1069 in the figure representsbreast cancer.
This indicates that 1069 geneshave direct interactions with breast cancerreferred in all sentences.Figure 2.
Degree centrality of the gene-breast cancerinteraction network.Figure 3 shows the relationship between eachdegree centrality and its count of nodes.Figure 3.
The relationship between each degreecentrality and its count of nodes.As shown in Figure 3, the node withmaximum degree centrality 1069 is target diseasewhile most of other nodes distribute from degreecentrality of 1 to 10 which are considered as leastrelated genes.
Table 2 lists part of ranks of all1069 genes in the order of degree centrality.Gene Degree CentralityTNF 359EGFR 342CRC 301IL-6 245EGF 200BRCA1 195HR 193GAPDH 190AR 188ATM 148TP53 138BRCA2 94Table 2: Part of ranks of all 1069 genes in the order ofdegree centrality.58From Table 2, we can find that BRCA1 andBRCA2 are known familial breast cancer geneswhich have gained authority validation.Although their mutations are not common insporadic breast cancer patients, they accounts forapproximately 80% to 90% among all hereditarybreast cancer.TP53 is a kind of mutant gene with highpenetrance which has also been verifiedassociation with breast cancer in genetics.Moreover, ATM and AR are low frequencygenes belong to specific loci, about 5% to 10%of breast cancer relate to at least one or morechanges in the susceptibility genes mentionedabove.The result of CRC in contrast is more likesome kind of institution's name: CooperativeResearch Centre for Discovery of Genes forCommon Human Diseases or the abbreviation ofanother disease: Colorectal Cancer (CRC).
Therehaven?t been any evidence reveals directcorrelation between CRC gene and breast cancer,we can only consider this as a misrecognition.In addition to genes described above, othergenes in the list have also been verified inauthoritative sites or papers.
These resultspreliminarily verified the accuracy of our system.5.2.2 Betweenness centralityFigure 4 illustrates betweenness centrality of theinteraction network of breast cancer.
Color andsize of each point reflect betweenness of thenode, which indicate the ability to control othernodes in the network.
Nodes in green have theminimum betweenness centrality while the colorof jade-green shows larger betweennesscentrality.
Yellow nodes indicate betweennesscentrality larger than jade-green and orangerepresents the largest.Figure 4.
Betweenness centrality of the gene-breastcancer interaction networkFigure 5 shows relationship between eachbetweenness centrality and its count of neighbors.Figure 5.
Relationship between each betweennesscentrality and its count of neighbors.As shown in Figure 5, the more adjacent nodes,the larger betweenness centrality.
The node withmost neighbors of 1068 has maximumbetweenness centrality of 0.35 while most nodesin the network have the count of neighbors from0 to 200 with their betweenness centralitybetween 0 and 0.04.
Table 3 lists part of ranks ofall 1069 genes in the order of betweennesscentrality.Gene Betweenness CentralityTNF 0.05981684EGFR 0.05912439CRC 0.04896846AR 0.02892632GAPDH 0.02877095AD 0.02863766IL-6 0.02545676HR 0.02381936BRCA1 0.02202402TP53 0.01603455ATM 0.01566084BRCA2 0.00507333Table 3: Part of ranks of all 1069 genes in the order ofbetweenness centrality.As can be seen from Table 3, the rank ofbetweenness centrality is approximately matchedwith the rank of degree centrality.
TNF, EGFRand CRC are still the highest ranked genes whileIL-6, AR, HR , GAPDH and ATM simplyexchanged their order.
AR, androgen receptor,has a quick raise in the rank list.
It plays a vitalrole in the development and maintenance of malereproductive function and the cause of prostatecancer, but the effect and function on breastcancer of AR have not been clear until 2010(most of the literature published before 2010).This result shows that the genes excavated by oursystem not only include genes in the knowninteraction network, but also reflect research59tendency at present or in a certain period of time.This also indicates the effectiveness ofunderstanding scientific research tendency of oursystem.As the definition of betweenness centrality, itreflects the ability to affect other nodes in thenetwork.
If a gene interacts with another genethrough an intermediate gene such as suppressionor promotion, then the role played by thisintermediate gene is decisive in this association.The more intermediate roles played inassociations, the greater the influence of the genein the network.
Similarly, among all genes in theneighborhood of a specific gene, the greater thebetweenness centrality of a gene, the moreinfluence it has on that specific gene.5.2.3 Closeness centralityFigure 6 illustrates closeness centrality of theinteraction network of breast cancer.Figure 6.
Closeness centrality of the gene-breastcancer interaction network.As can be seen from Figure 6, red node at thecenter of the network represents breast cancerand neighboring orange nodes stand for directrelated genes while peripheral nodes in greenrepresents least related genes.
Figure 7 showsrelationship between each closeness centralityand its count of neighbors.Figure 7.
Relationship between each closenesscentrality and its count of neighbors.Figure 7 shows the tendency of closenesscentrality in the network while number ofneighbors increases.
There is an approximatepositive correlation between the count ofneighbors and the closeness centrality of nodesbut not so obvious compared with betweennesscentrality or degree centrality.
For instance, thecloseness centrality ranges from 0.14 to 0.34 fornodes with only one neighbor.
This tendencyrepresents that closeness centrality reflectgeographical centricity of each node moreefficiently compared with degree centrality andbetweenness centrality with less dependence oncount of neighbors.
For example, if a node hasonly one edge to the center of the network, thisnode is bound to own large closeness centralityeven though this edge is the only edge it has.Meanwhile, another node has much more thanone edge but far away from the center of thenetwork, the closeness centrality of it can neverbe larger than the former one.
Table 4 lists partof ranks of all 1069 genes in the order ofcloseness centrality.Gene Closeness CentralityTNF 0.43612418EGFR 0.43550963CRC 0.4247366PTEN 0.41920608IL-6 0.41814738AR 0.41092005EGF 0.40954064BRCA1 0.40914306STAT3 0.4088544MMP-9 0.40386793HR 0.40330579MMP-2 0.40031085Table 4: Part of ranks of all 1069 genes in the order ofcloseness centrality.Table 4 shows that list ordered by closenesscentrality is generally similar to list ordered bydegree centrality and betweenness centrality.TNF, EGFR and CRC are still highest rankinggenes.
However, genes like STAT3, MMP-9 andMMP-2 appear firstly in the list where STAT3ranks 18 in degree centrality and 14 inbetweenness centrality.
The details of STAT3has been clearly described in Hsieh FC et al.STAT3 full-called signal transducer andactivator of transcription 3, which is oftendetected in breast cancer tissues and its cell lines.STAT3 has already been defined as an oncogenesince its activated form in nude mice can producemalignant transformation of cultured cells andultimately form tumors.
MMP-9 and MMP-2 aregelatinase, proteolytic enzymes involved in60process of tumor invasion which is considered asa potential tumor marker in breast cancer.All these three genes can be identified asdirect related genes with breast cancer.
Theseassociations which are not obvious in degreecentrality and betweenness centrality indicatingthe effectiveness of closeness centrality infinding related gene to a specific disease.5.3 Result EvaluationWe enumerate 31 top genes ranked withweighted centrality considered as related tobreast cancer due to our system.

The accuracyrate is 83.9% for these top 31 genes and diseasesand 74.2% for these top 31 genes.6 ConclusionUnderstanding the role of genetics in diseases isone of the major goals of the post-genome era.We have proposed an automatic gene-diseaseassociation extraction approach based on textmining and network analysis.Gene-breast cancer interaction networkanalysis demonstrated that degree, betweenness,and closeness centralities can estimate diseaserelated genes effectively.
And closenesscentrality is able to find disease related geneswhich are not obvious ranked by degreecentrality and betweenness centrality.
In addition,this result showed that the genes excavated byour system not only include genes in the knowninteraction network, but also reflect researchtendency at present or in a certain period of time.This also indicates the effectiveness ofunderstanding scientific research tendency of oursystem.61AcknowledgmentThis research has been partially supported by theNational High-Tech Research & DevelopmentProgram of China 863 Program under Grant No.2012AA011103, National Natural ScienceFoundation of China under Grant No.
