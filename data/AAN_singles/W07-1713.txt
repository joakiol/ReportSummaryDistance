Researchof morphological disambiguation andmorphological annotation of the 100million word Lithuanian corpus arepresented in the article.
Statistical methodshave enabled to develop the automatic toolof morphological annotation forLithuanian, with the disambiguationprecision of 94%.
Statistical data about thedistribution of parts of speech, mostfrequent wordforms, and lemmas, in theannotated Corpus of The ContemporaryLithuanian Language is also presented.1 IntroductionThe goal of this paper is to present the experienceand results of compiling a large Lithuanianmorphologically annotated corpus by using anavailable Lithuanian morphological analyser anddealing with the disambiguation problem.The Corpus of the Contemporary LithuanianLanguage is a database of electronic texts, which iswidely used in Lithuania.
It well represents thepresent Lithuanian language and its differentvarieties (more about that in http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/).vidas@donelaitis.vdu.lt e.rimkute@hmf.vdu.lt a.utka@hmf.vdu.lt<word="Nenuostabu" lemma="nenuostabus" type="bdvrneig nelygin.l ne?vard?

").94Morphological annotation of the corpus willfurther increase capabilities of the corpus enablingextraction of unambiguous lexical and morpho-logical information.
The annotated corpus willsoon be accessible for search on the internet.
At themoment this corpus is fully accessible only at theCentre of Computational Linguistics of theVytautas Magnus University.
The tools forannotating Lithuanian texts are available forresearch purposes by request.The Lithuanian morphological analyserLemuoklis (Zinkevi?ius, 2000) produces results ofmorphological analysis of Lithuanian wordforms,but leaves unsolved the problem of morphologicalambiguity.
Considering successful application ofstatistical methods in solving the morphologicalambiguity for other languages, statistical methodshave also been chosen for Lithuanian.
Research ofmorphological disambiguation and results ofmorphological annotation of the 100 million wordLithuanian corpus are presented in the article.2 Morphological analysis of LithuanianMorphologically ambiguous wordforms are wordsor wordforms that have two or more possiblelemma interpretations or morphological annota-tions, e. g. for the wordform kov?
(en.
fights, pl.Gen.)
the morphological analyser Lemuoklisidentifies two lemmas kovas (en.
rook [bird] orMarch [month]) and kova (en.
fight), while thewordform naktis (en.
night) can be in SingularNominative or in Plural Accusative case (moreinformation on ambiguity for Lithuanian seeRimkut?, 2006).Approximately a half of all wordforms in theLithuanian annotated corpus are morphologicallyambiguous (Rimkut?, 2006), which is comparableto other inflected languages, e.g.
for the Czechlanguage it is 46% (Haji?, 2004:173).For developing the automatic disambiguationsystem a morphologically annotated trainingcorpus is necessary.
Manual creation of 1 M wordLithuanian annotated corpus is a very time consu-ming task, which has taken 5 man-years tocomplete.
Firstly, the annotation format needs tobe developed and mastered (see Figure 1), then it isnecessary to assign a word to an appropriate part ofspeech, and often it is very difficult to find acorrect grammatical reading for a word.
It alsotakes a lot of time reviewing and trying to put allannotated texts into one uniform standard.3 Automatic morphological annotation ofthe Lithuanian corpusStatistical morphological disambiguation usingsmall manually annotated training corpora looks asquite a simple task, when frequencies ofgrammatical features are generated during thetraining phase and the most likely sequence ofmorphological features is found in a new text bythe help of various probability methods.
Drawingon the experience of morphological annotationsystems for other free word order languages(D?bowski, 2004; Haji?
et al, 2001; Palanisamy etal., 2006 etc.
), it is obvious that the corpus-basedmethod is most suitable for the developing suchsystems for Lithuanian.The Czech experience (Hladk?, 2000) was veryexpedient for developing automatic morphologicalannotation tool for Lithuanian, especially becauseCzech similarly to Lithuanian is a free word orderlanguage.
Czech research applies statistical HiddenMarkov Models and formal rule-based methods forCzech and English languages.
It is important tonote that these methods are language independentand can be applied to Lithuanian.
The onlylanguage dependent factor is a small morpho-logically annotated corpus for training.
In variousexperiments the selection of Czech morphologicalfeatures was regularized and optimised, whichhelped to achieve close to English languageprecision of 96%.
However this precision isachieved with a limited number of Czech morpho-logical features.
The precision of 94 % is achievedwhen all features of Czech language are selected(Hladk?, 2000).4 Statistical morphologicaldisambiguationMorphologically analysed words are the input ofthe automatic morphological annotation system,while the best sequence of morphological featuresis its output.
Annotation of a new text involvesestablishing the most likely sequence of morpho-logical features by the help of Hidden Markovmodels.
Not all combinations of trigrams andbigrams can be found even in the biggest corpora.Therefore, the linear smoothing of the missingcases is used, as the probability of the most likely95sequence cannot be equal to zero (see more onHMM in Jurafsky (2000:305-307)).The following HMM model is used by Czechscientists:nttttiiiiiintitiiiiTtttTtttptwpttptptwp,...,,),,|()|()|()()|(max21211211~3~~~1~=??????????
?=We expanded the model by including thelemma.
This procedure is important to Lithuanian,where different lemmas often have identicalwordforms and morphological features.

In case notrigram tag, bigram tag and unigram tag is foundthen the probability of a trigram assumes a verysmall number which is equal to 1 divided by thesize of the tagset.
The highest score is assigned to atrigram, lower ?
to bigram, and lowest ?
unigram.The disambiguation tool has been developed at theCentre of Computational Linguistics of theVytautas Magnus University using C++ tools.
Allresults reported in this paper are based on approachusing an accuracy criterion (number of correctlydisambiguated results divided by number of inputwords).
We do not use any morphological pre-processing.
A precision of 94% has been achievedfor establishing tags, which is comparable toresults achieved for other languages, when the 1million word training corpus is used.
A precisionof 99% is achieved for establishing lemmas.
Forthe precision test a special 50 thousand wordcorpus has been used, which is not included in thetraining corpus.The following statistics has been derived fromthe 1 M word training corpus1:Different lemmas   41,408Different pairs of wordformsand tags130,511Different pairs of wordformsand lemmas121,634Unigram tagsTC  1,449Bigram tags   76,312Trigram tags   544,922Training corpus size | |  trainT  1,009,516Table 1: Corpus statisticsThe number of lemmas in the training corpus issufficient to gather frequencies in order to solveambiguous lemmas.
Unknown lemmas are notambiguous in the training corpus, as they are rareand have unique meanings.The size of the tagset is 1449.
Lithuanian is arelatively free word order language, and thereforeit is difficult to get reliable bigram and trigramstatistics.
We decided to gather distant bigram and1 See more about manually tagged Lithuanian Corpusand Lithuanian language tagset in Zinkevi?ius et al2005.trigram frequencies using a gap of 1.
As a bigramwe consider two subsequent tags (<A> <B>) ortwo tags with a gap of 1 in between (<A> <gap><B>).
Similarly, a trigram is a sequence of threesubsequent tags (<A> <B> <C>) or a sequence ofthree tags with a gap of 1 between the first andsecond tag (<A> <gap> <B> <C>) or between thesecond and third tag (<A> <B> <gap> <C>).Distant n-grams help to reduce the number ofunknown bigrams and trigrams in the trainingcorpus.5 Statistical data for the morphologicallyannotated corpus of LithuanianMost important statistical data for themorphologically annotated Lithuanian corpus:?
Corpus size ?
111,745,938 running words;?
Number of wordforms ?
1,830,278;?
Number of unrecognized wordforms ?824,387 (5,6 % of all tokens);?
Number of recognized wordforms ?1,005,891.225,319 different lemmas have been recognizedin the Corpus of Contemporary Lithuanian.Distribution of parts of speech in the whole 100M word corpus does not differ significantly fromthe distribution in the training corpus (see Figure2).
The biggest difference is in the number ofunknown words.
There are no unknown words inthe training corpus, because it has been semi-automatically annotated and disambiguated.
Thenumber of unknown words in the 100 M wordcorpus is influenced by morphological analyzer,i.e., not all words are successfully recognized.A big part of unknown words are proper nouns.Presently the dictionary of the morphologicalanalyser contains 5255 high frequency proper nounlemmas (e.g.
Lietuva (en.
Lithuania)), whichaccount for 3.2% of the vocabulary in the largeannotated corpus.
In the training corpus propernouns account for 4.3% of the vocabulary, and weexpect the similar proportion in the large annotatedcorpus.
The average frequency of a proper nounlemma is 4.6 in the training corpus.
Thus we couldestimate the size of the dictionary of proper nounsat about 250,000 lemmas.976 The remaining problemsThe achieved precision of 94% for morphologicalannotation leaves some room for improvement.
Itis still difficult to solve homographic problems,where some wordforms of different words areidentical.
For example, wrong lemmas arefrequently chosen for the wordforms tonas (en.tone) and tona (en.
ton), kovas (en.
rook [bird]) andkova (en.
fight), Bir?ai (Lithuanian town) and bir?a(en.
stock-market).Syncretism of grammatical cases is not alwayssolved correctly.
Most often the incorrect analysisis given for words of feminine gender, whensingular Genitive and plural Nominative cases areconfused (e. g. mokyklos (en.
school)).Some cases are problematic even for a humanlinguist, when it is not clear which part of speech(noun or verb) is used in such collocations: kovosd?l teis?s likti pirmajame e?elone (lit.
fight/ fightsfor the right to stay in the first league); kovos sunarkotikais (lit.
fight/ fights against drugs); kovossu okupantais (lit.
fight/ fights against occupants).Even if the part of speech of the word kovos ischosen as a noun, then the ambiguity case stillremains.
The broader context is needed to solvesuch problems.Interjections are not very often used inLithuanian, nevertheless the morphological abbre-viation a is confused with the interjection a.Abbreviations that are identical to Romannumerals are often annotated incorrectly: the mostproblems are caused by the abbreviation V.Sometimes wrong lemma is chosen.
The wordswith fixed forms such as ir (en.
and), tik (en.
only)cause many problems as they can be interjections,particles, or adverbs.
The lemma of the wordformvienas (en.
one, alone, single) is not always chosencorrectly, as this word can be a pronoun, anadjective, a numeral, or even a proper noun.
It ishoped that some of these problems will disappearafter improving the program of morphologicalanalysis.7 ConclusionsThe method of Hidden Markov models formorphological annotation has allowed achievingthe precision of 94%, which is comparable to theprecision achieved for other languages, when 1 Mword training corpus is used.
The precision of 99%is achieved for establishing lemmas of Lithuanianwords.
The precision measure estimates only theprocess of disambiguation, while unrecognisedwords are not included in the precision test.The amount of unrecognised wordforms makesup 5,6% of all tokens (more that 800,000 differentwordforms).
In order to analyse the missingwordforms around 100-150 thousand lemmas needto be added to the lexicon of morphological0510152025303540NounVerbAdj.Num.Pron.Adv.Part.Conj.Interj.Onom.Prep.Acron.Abbr.UnknownOther1 M word corpus100 M word corpusPercentsPOSFigure 2: Distribution of parts of speech in 1 M and 100 M word corpora.98analyser, i.e.
