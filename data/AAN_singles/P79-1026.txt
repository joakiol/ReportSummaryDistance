New Brunswick ,  N. J .Abstract: A "Front End" for a Computer-Based GlaucomaConsultation System is described.
The system views acase as a description of a particular instance of a classof concepts called "structured objects" and builds up arepresentation of the instance from the sentences in thecase.
The information required by the consultationsystem is then extracted and passed on to theconsultation system in the appropriately coded form.
Acore of syntactlc, semantic end contextual rules whichare applicable to all structured objects is beingdeveloped together with a representation of thestructured object GLAUCOMA-PATIENT.
There is also afacility for add ing  domain dependent  syntax,abbreviations and defaults.system that has a core of syntax and semantics that isapp l i cab le  to all s t ructured  ob jec ts  and wh ich  can  beextended by  domain  spec i f i c  syntax ,  id ioms and defau l ts .Cons iderab le  work  on the  in terpretat ion  o f  hosp i ta ldischarge summaries, which are very similar to  casedescr ip t ions ,  has  been done by  a group  at  NYU\[Sager 1978\].
Their work has focused on the  creation offormatted data bases for subsequent question answeringand is syntax based.
The research reported here isconcerned with ext ract ing  from the  case the informationunderstandable by a consultation system and is primarilyknowledge based .I.
STRUCTURED OBJECTSDuring the  past decade a number of Medical Consultationsystems have been developed, for example INTERNIST\[Pople.
Myers and Miller 1973\], CASNET/GLAUCOMA\[Weiss st. al.
1978\], MYCIN \[Shortliffe 1976\].
Currentlystill others are being developed.
Some of these programsare reaching a stage where they are being used inhospitals and clinics.
Such use brings with it the needfor fast and natural communication with these programsfor the reporting of the "clinical state" of the patient.This includes laboratory f ind ings ,  symptoms, medicationsand certain history data.
Ideally the reporting would bedone by speech but this is currently beyond the state ofthe art in speech understanding.
A more reasonable goalis to try to capture the physicians" written "NaturalLanguage" for describing patients and to write programsto convert these descriptions to the appropriate codedinput to the consultation systems.The original motivation for this research came from thedesire to have natural language input of cases toCASNET/GLAUCOMA a computer-based glaucoma consultationsystem developed at Retgers University.
A case isseveral paragraphs of sentences , written by a physician,which describe a patient who has glaucoma or who issuspected of having glaucoma.
It was desired to have a"Natural Language Front-End" which could interpret thecases and pass the content to the consultation system.In the  beg inn ing  stages it was by no means clear that itwould even be possible to have a "front end" since it wasexpected that some sophisticated knowledge of Glaucomawould be necessary  and that  feedback  from theconsu l ta t ion  sys tem would be  requ i red  in  unders tand ingthe  input  sentences .
However dur ing  the  course  o f  theinvestigation it became clear that  certaingeneralizations could be made from the domain ofGlaucoma.
The key discovery was that under somereasonable assumptions the physic iane notes could beviewed as descriptions of instances of a class ofconcepts called structured oblects and the knowledgeneeded to interpret the notes was mostly knowledge of therelationship between language and structured objectsrather than knowledge of Glaucoma.This observation changed the focus of the researchsomm~at  - to the investigation of the relationshipbetween language and s t ructured  ob jec ts  w i th  par t i cu la remphas is  on  the  s t ructured  ob jec t  GLAUCOMA-PATIENTo Th ischange o f  focus  has  resu l ted  in  the  deve lopment  o f  aA s t ructured  ob jec t  i s  l i ke  a template  \ [S r idharan  1978\]o r  un i t  \ [gobrow and Winograd  1977\] or  concept\[Brachman 1978\] in that  i t  implicitly defines a set  ofinstances.
It is characterized by a biererchialstructure.
This structure consists of other structuredob jects  which are  components (not  sub-concepts \ [ ) .
Forexample the s t ructured  ob Ject  PATIENT-LEFT-EYE i s  acomponent of the structured object PATIENT.
Structuredobjects also have attributes, for exemple PATIENT-SEX isan attribute of PATIENT.
Attributes can have numeric ornon-nemeric vAlues.
Each attribute has an associated"measurement concept" which defines the set of legalvalues, units etc.A s t ructured  ob jec t  i s  represented  as  a .
d i rec ted  graph~here  nodes  represent  components  and a t t r ibutes ,  and arcsrepresent relations between the concept* and itscomponents.
The graph has a distinguished node,analogous to the root of a tree, whose label is the nameof the concept.
All incoming errs to the concept enteronly at this distinguished or "head" node.
Figure I is adiagram of part of the structured object GLAUCOMA-PATIENT.
There are only a limited number of relations?These are:ATTR This denotes an attribute llnk.MBY Associates an attribute with  its measurement.PART The PART relation holds between two concepts.CONT The CONTAINS re la t ion  holds between two concepts .ASS An ASSOCIATION llnk.
Some relations, such as therelation between PATIENT and PATIENT-MEDICATIONcannot be characterized aa ATTR, PART or CONT butare more complex, as shown by the followln$examples:the age of the patient (ATTR) (I)The medication of the patient (ASS) (2)The patient is receiving medication (ASS) (3)The patient is receiving age (?)
(4)Al though the  re la t ion  between PATIENT and PATIENT-MEDICATION has  some sur face  fo rms that  make i t  l ooklike an ATTR re la t ion  th i s  is not  rea l ly  the case.A "true" s t ructured  ob jec t  would not  have  ASS linksbut  they  must  be  in t roduced to  dea l  w i th  GLAUCOMA-PATIENT.
the  formal semantics of the ASS relationare very similar to those of the ATTR and PARTrelations.Th is  research  was suppor ted  under  Grant  No.

It is possible that a different Instrumentwill be needed to measure the value of an attribute inthe right eye than in the taft aye.

Only those mechanisms formanipulating structured objects that are necessary forthe interpretation of cases are beln E implemented.Brachmen \[Brachman 1978\] has examined the problems ofrepresenting concepts in considerably more detail.I.
1 MEASL~EMENT CONCEPTSMeasurements are associated with  those  nodes of the  graphChat have Ineomln8 ATTR ~rcs.
There are twn kinds ofmeasurements those with numerical values and those withnon-n~er lcn l  values.
Numerical measurements have thefollowln E internal structure:RANGE A pair of numbers that speclfy the range.UNITS A set of units for the measurement.QVALSET A set of qualitative values for the measurement.TIME A dace or one of the values PAST, PRESENT.INSTR A set of possible instruments for taking themaeaur amen, ?CF A confidence fac tor  o r  measure of reliability fo rthe measurement.There is also soma procedural knnwledge assoclatad withmeasurm-ents.
This relates numerical values toquantitative values, fellah Ill,lea with instruments etc.An example  of a measurement concept  is given i n  figure 2.m | iC I -FATIENT-LEFT-K YE-FLUI D-FR ES S UR E-M SMTRANGE 0, 120UNITS K-~4-HGQVALSET (ONEOF K-DECREASED, K-NORMAL,K-ELEVATED, K-SEVERELY-ELEVATED)TIME (ONEOF PAST, PRESENT, DATE)INSTR (ONEOF K-A PPLANAT TON -T ONOM ETER,K-SCHIOTZ -TONOM ETER )CF O, I***************************if VALUE < 5 then **ERROR**if 5 <- VALUE < i0 than QVAL - K-DECREASEDif l0 <- VALUE < 21 than QVAL - K-NORMALif 21 <- VALUE < 30 then QVAL - K-ELEVATEDif 30 <- VALUE < I00 then QVAL - K-SEVERELY-ELEVATEDif I00 <- VALUE than **ERROR**Fi~ur e 2The Measurement Concept for Intra-ocular PressureItems prefixed with  a ~ "K 't in figure 2 denote constants.Constants are "terminal items" having no furtherdefinition in the representation of the structuredobject.number of instances is known beforehand, for examplethere can only be one instance of CI-PATIENT~.EFT-EYE0while in other cases the number of instances isdetermined by the input, for example measurements ofIn,re-ocular pressure at different times are differentinstances.
Instances are created along a number ofdimensions, the most common one being TIME, for examplepressure today, pressure on Mar 23.
When differentinstruments are used to take measurements  thisconstitutes a second dimension for instances.
The rulesof instantlatlon are embedded in the core.A partial instantiation of CI-PATIENT can be done beforethe first sentence is processed by tracing links markedNECESSARY.
Any component or attribute ins,an,laced atthis stage will be introduced by a definite noun phrasewhile optional components will be introduced byindefinite noun phrases.2.
SEMANTICSA fundamental assumption that has been made and one thatis Justlfled by examination of several sets of cases isthat the sentences dascrlbe an instance of a patient withthe assumption that the reader already knows the concept.None of the sentences in the notes examined had aninterpretation which would requlre updating the conceptGLAUCCMA-PATIENT.
The interpretation of a case is thusconsldared to be the construction of the  thecorresponding instance of GLAUCOMA-PATIENT.The nature of structured objects as outlined abovedlccataa that only two fundamental kinds of assertionsare expected in sentences.
There wlll either be anassertion about the existence of an optional component asin (5) or about the value of an attribute as in (6) and(7) ?There Is an arcuete scotoma od.
**The pressure is 20 in the left eye.The pressure is normal os.
(5)(6)(7)Vary few of the sentences contain Just one assertion,most contain several as in (8) and (9).There is a nasal step and an arcuetescotoma in the left eye and a centralisland in the right eye (8)~he medication is I0 percent pilocarplnedaily in both eyes.
(9)2.
I THE MEANING OF A SENTENCEEven though sentences are viewed as containing assertionstheir meanings can be represented as sets of instances,Non-nmnerlcal measurements differ from numerical given that there is a procedure which takes thesemeasurements in that RANGE, UNIT and QVALSET are replaced instances and incorporates them into the growing instanceby VALSET.
One or more members of VALSET are to be of GLAUCOMA-PATIENT.
Ibis is due to the tree structureselected in creating an instance of the measurement of instances since Instantlatlon of a concept involvesconcept, for example: Instantlatlon of all concepts between itself and theroot.
In fact, many sentences in the cases do not evenCI-PATIENT-SEX-MSMT VALSET (ONEOF K-MALE K-FEMALE) contain a relation but merely assert the existence of aninstance or of an attribute value as in (I0) and (\[1).I.

Instances are created piece-meal as theInformation trickles in from the case.

( I I )** Opthalmologlsts frequently use the abbreviations "ed"for "in the right eye", "os" for "in the left eye" and"ou" for "in hor/1 ayes"1052.2 PROVISIONAL INSTANCESAny particular noun or  adjective could refer to a numberof different concepts.
"Medication" for" example couldrefer to CI-PATIENT-MEDICATION, CI-PATIENT-&IGHT-EYE-MEDICATION or (I-PATIENT-LEFT-EYE-MEDICATION.
Moreoverin any particular use it cou ld  be  referring Co one ormore of its possible referents.
In (t2)Medicacion consists of diamoxand pllocarpine drops in both  eyes.
(12)"medication" refers co all of its possible referentssince d iamox is not  given to  the eye but  is taken orally.In addition to this, ic ?s generally not possible to knowat the clme of encountering a word whether it refers toan existing Instance or to a new instance.
This is dueto the fact thaC at the time of encountering a referenceto a concept all of the values of the instance dimensionsmlghc not be known.
The mechanism for dealing with theseproblems is Co assign "provisional Instances" as thereferents of words end phrases when they are scannedduring the parse and to turn these provisional instancesInto "real" instances when the correct parse has beenfound.
This involves finding the values of the instancedimensions from rest of the sentence, from knowledge ofdefaults or perhaps from values in previous sentences.The most common Instance dimension is TIME and its valueis readily obtained from the tense of the verb or from aclme phrase.
If the instance dimensions indicate anexisting instance then the partial provisional instancefrom the sentence is incorporated into the existing realinstance, otherwise a new instance is created.2.3  FINDING THE MEANING OF A SENTENCESevera l  mapp ings  can  be  made f rom the  representat ion  o fs t ructured  ob jec ts  to  syntactic c lasses .
For  example,all nodes  wi l l  be re fer red  to  by nouns  and noun phrases ,l inks  w i l l  be  re fer red  to  by  prepos i t ions  and  verbs  andmembers o f  a VALSET or  a 0VALSET w i l l  ba  re fer red  to  byad jec t ives .
The l inks  between concepts  and cha  ~rdsthat  can  be  used  to  re fer  to  them are made at  sys tembu i ld  t ime when che s t ructured  ob jec t  i s  const ructed .Some words  such  as "both"  and "very"  re fer  to  procedureswhose act ions  are  the  same no mat ter  what  the  s t ructuredob jec t .The nature of structured objects and of the sentences incases Indicate thac a "case'* \[Bruce 1975\] approach tosemantic analysis is a "natural".
A case syecsm ham infact been implemented with such cases as ATTRIBUTE,OBJECT, VALUE, and UNIT.
One case that is particularlyuseful is FOCUS.
I t  is used to  record  re ferences  Co lefteye or  r ight  eye  fo r  use  in  embedded or  con jo inedsentences such as (13).The pressure  in  the  l e f t  eye  i s  27and there is an arcuate scocoma.
(13)For the reasons discussed in section 2.2 ic is necessaryco assign sacs of candidate referents to  soma of the  casevalues during the course of the parse.
These sacs arepruned as higher levels of the parse tree are built.3.
SYNTAXIt is noc really possible to  vlew cha  sentencescomprising a case as a subset of English since many ofthe elementary grammatical rules are broken (e.g.frequent omission of verbs).
Rather the sentences are ina medical dialect and parr of the task of wrlClng aninterpreter for cases involves an anthropologicalinvestlgaclon of the dialect and its definit ion in someformal way.
An analysls of a nt~"ber of cases revealedthe following characteristics (see also \[Sangscer 1978\]):I) Frequent omission of verbs and punctuation.2) ~ch use  o f  abbrev ia t ions  loca l  to  thedomain .3) Two kinds of ellipsis are evident.
In onekind the constituents left ouC are co be recoveredf rom knowledge of  the  s t ructured  ob jec t ;  the  ocherk ind  i s  the  s tandard  k ind  o f  textua l  e l l ips i s  wherethe  miss ing  macer i s l  i s  recovered  f rom prev ioussentences .4) Two d i f fe rent  uses of ad ject iva l  andprepos i t iona l  qualifiers can be d is t ingu ished .There is a referenclal use as in "in Left eye" in(14) and also an attributive use as in "of elevatedpressure"  in (14)There  i s  a h i s tory  o f  e levatedpressure in the left eye .
(14)An adjective can only have a referential use if iChas previously been used attrlbucively or if i trefers to a focussing attribute.5) Sentences containing several assertionstend to tak~a one of two forms.
In one of these chafocus is on an  eye and several measurements aregiven for that eye as in (15).In  the  le f t  eye  chars  i s  a pressureo f  27, .5  cupp ing  and an  ercuaCeecotome.
(:5)In the  o ther  fo rm the  focus  i s  on  an  a t t r ibute  andva lues  fo r  both  eyes  are  g iven  as  in  (16) .the pressure  i s  I0 od and 20 os .
(16)A good dea l  o f  ext ra  syntact i c  complex i ty  i sin t roduced by  the  fac t  chat  there  are  2 eyes  (apar t i cu la r  ex - , .p la  o f  the  genera l  phenomenon o fmultiple idanclcal sub-parts).
The problm- is chac(ha qualifying phrases "in the left / rlghc/bocheyes" appear in many different places in thesentences and conslderabla work must  be done tofind the correct scope.4.
