R{j}ecnik.com: English?Serbo-Croatian Electronic DictionaryVlado KES?ELJFaculty of Computer ScienceDalhousie University, HalifaxCanada, vlado@cs.dal.caTanja KES?ELJKorlex SoftwareBedford NS, Canadatanja@keselj.netLarisa ZLATIC?Larisa Zlatic Language ServicesAustin, Texas, USAlarisaz@serbiantranslator.comAbstractThe features of R{j}ecnik.com dictionary, asone of the first on-line English-Serbo-Croatiandictionaries are presented.
The dictionary hasbeen on-line for the past five years and has beenfrequently visited by the Internet users.
Weevaluate and discuss the system based on theanalysis of the collected data about site vis-its during this five-year period.
The dictionarystructure is inspired by the WordNet basic de-sign.
The dictionary?s source knowledge baseand the software system provide interfaces toproducing an on-line dictionary, a printed-paperdictionary, and several electronic resources use-ful in Natural Language Processing.1 IntroductionThe dictionaries, monolingual, bilingual, ormultilingual, are the standard way of collectingand presenting lexicographic knowledge aboutone or more languages.
The electronic dic-tionaries (EDs) are not merely a straightfor-ward extension of their printed counterparts,but they entail additional purely computationalproblems.ED as marked-up text.
An ED may be seensimply as a long, marked-up text.
The im-portant computational issues arise around theproblem of efficient keyword search and appro-priate presentation of the dictionary data.
Thesearch is performed in the context of a markupscheme, such as SGML or XML, and the querymodel has to provide expressibility for searchqueries within this scheme; e.g, searching fora keyword within a certain text region.
Anexample of such research is the OED projectconducted from 1987 through 1994 (Tompa andGonnet, 1999; OED, 2004).
One of the achieve-ments of the OED project was that the searchsoftware was able to retrieve all occurrences ofwords and phrases within the dictionary corpusof size 570 MB in less than a second (Tompaand Gonnet, 1999).Knowledge-base Structure of an ED.The second aspect of EDs is the structure ofinformation represented in them.
This struc-ture is of interest to linguists, lexicographers,and various dictionary users, but it is of chiefinterest to computational linguists.
A majorcomputational challenge is how to design thedictionary structure in order to make its main-tenance manageable and efficient.
Various lex-ical resources that were developed in the lastfew decades have become invaluable in NaturalLanguage Processing (NLP), most notably theWordNet.
Another reason why efficiency in dic-tionary maintenance is important is that natu-ral languages change dynamically and good EDshould track these lexical innovations.
Differ-ent domains need to be covered, and the partsof the dictionary that are becoming old and ar-chaic need to be time-stamped and archived assuch.In this paper, we present a bilingual bidirec-tional on-line Serbo-Croatian (SC)-English dic-tionary that has been available on the Internetsince 1999.
This is the first published report de-scribing this resource.
The dictionary internalstructure is motivated by the WordNet struc-ture, and it provides a way of producing mono-lingual SC and bilingual SC-English wordnet.2 Related WorkThe OED project (Tompa and Gonnet, 1999;OED, 2004) is a related project that was dis-cussed in section 1.
There are many on-linedictionaries on the Internet: monolingual, bilin-gual, and even multilingual.
Probably the mostcomprehensive list is given at the site YourDic-tionary.com1, collected by Robert Beard fromthe Bucknell University, which lists on-line dic-tionaries for 294 languages, including two en-tries for sign languages (ASL and Sign).There are not that many on-line SC-English21http://www.YourDictionary.com2Under language name ?Serbo-Croatian?
(SC) weassume labels Serbo-Croatian, Serbian, Croatian, orBosnian.dictionaries.
YourDictionary.com lists aboutfive such dictionaries.
Most of them are narrow-domain dictionaries.
The Google directory3lists seven dictionaries.
Rjecnik.com4 is the old-est one in these language pairs and is still activeand expanding.
Tkusmic.com5 was created in2003 and has a very similar interface.
One of themost popular dictionaries is Krstarica.com6.
Along list of dictionaries is given at Danko S?ipka?sweb site.7 Many of those are not active anymore, or they are textual dictionary files with alimited domain.The WordNet (Miller, 2004) project is rele-vant to our work, since we propose a dictionarystructure based on the building blocks that fol-low the WordNet structure.
As a result, a di-rect by-product of our ED is an SC WordNet.The task of creating a Serbo-Croatian Word-Net is already underway within the Balkanetproject (Christodoulakis, 2002).3 Project DescriptionProject history.
The on-line dictionaryR{j}ecnik.com has been active since 1999.
Oneof its most visible characteristics, also noted byother users, is simplicity of the user interface.There is one search textual field in which theuser enters the query and the dictionary reportsall dictionary entries matching the query on ei-ther English or SC side.
It provides an efficientsearch mechanism, returning the results withina second.Lexical resources.
As a lexicographic re-source, this is a wide-coverage, up-to-date, bidi-rectional, and bilingual dictionary covering notonly general, often used terms, but also over8,000 computer and Internet terms,8 as well ashealthcare and medical vocabulary, includinguseful abbreviations.
The entries are groupedby semantic meaning and part of speech, inthe WordNet fashion.
The English lexemes areassociated with their phonetic representations,and the entries are marked by domain of usage(e.g., computers, business, finance, medicine).Colloquial and informal expressions are marked3http://directory.google.com4http://rjecnik.com and http://recnik.com5http://www.tkuzmic.com/dictionary/6http://www.krstarica.com/recnik/7http://www.public.asu.edu/?dsipka/rjeynici.html8A number of the terms was collectedthrough public discussion at the e-mail list Ser-bian Terminology maintained by Danko Sipka(http://main.amu.edu.pl/mailman/listinfo/st-l).with special symbols so that they can be eas-ily identified.
In addition, the dictionary con-tains plenty of illustrative examples showing thelanguage in use.
A suitable text encoding forSC is used so that the software generates bothLatin (Roman) and Cyrillic script versions.
Di-alectical and geographical differences are alsomarked.Software overview.
The dictionary softwareis developed in the Perl programming language.From the source dictionary file, the searchableon-line resource file is generated.
It is in tex-tual format and it is indexed through an in-verted file index for searchable terms in Englishand SC.
The searchable terms are chosen selec-tively.
The tags and descriptions are not search-able since this would produce spurious searchresults.Dictionary structure.
Following the ideasfrom OED (Tompa and Gonnet, 1999), weadopted the philosophy of modern text markupsystems that ?a computer-processable versionof text is well-represented by interleaving ?tags?with the text of the original document, still leav-ing the original words in proper sequence.?
Ad-ditionally, we adopted the ideas from the Word-Net project (Miller, 2004) in structuring ourknowledge base around the basic entry unit be-ing a meaning; i.e., one meaning = one en-try.
One source dictionary entry (vs. a printed,or on-line dictionary entry) corresponds to onesynset in WordNet.
It is represented in onephysical line in a textual file, or it may be storedin several lines which are continued by having abackslash (\) character at the end of each linebut the last one.
An entry starts with the En-glish lexemes separated by commas followed byan equal sign (=), and the corresponding SC lex-emes, also separated by commas.
Additionalpertinent information is encoded using tags.This representation is conceptually simple andefficient in terms of manual maintenance andmemory use.
It is also flexible, since it allowstags to define features that refer to the wholeentry or just individual lexemes.
Such rep-resentation deviates from the commonly usedXML notation because we find the XML nota-tion to be more ?machine-friendly?
than user-friendly, but it can be automatically convertedto XML.
To illustrate the difference betweenTEI (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2003),the standard XML-based markup scheme, andour markup scheme, we adopt an example from(Erjavec, 1999), which is shown in in Fig.

1 shows an entry withTEI markup, in (B) we give our correspondingentry.
The tags are preceded with a colon (:).English lexemes are associated with their pho-netic representations within the square brack-ets.
The phonetic representation is encoded us-ing the vfon encoding.9 All changes to the dic-tionary can be easily tracked down using the key:id tag and the standard CVS (Control VersionSystem) system.
The encoding ipp is used to en-code SC text fragments, since they include ad-ditional letters beside the standard 7-bit ASCIIset.
The on-line version of the dictionary is en-coded using the dual1 encoding for simplicityand efficiency reasons.
The input query can beentered using the ipp encoding, and is trans-lated into the dual1 encoding before matching.The krascii encoding10 is additionally acceptedin the input query as the most common tran-scribing scheme, although it inherently leads tosome incorrect matches.A very systematic variation in SC isekavian vs. ijekavian dialect; for example:mleko/mlijeko (milk) and primeri/primjeri (ex-amples), but also hteo/htio (wanted).

2.4 Dictionary and Usage StatisticsThe dictionary has been on-line for five years(since 22-Jul-99).
As of 28-Apr-2004, it has60,338 lexemes, organized in 20,911 entries.
Theaverage system response time is 0.4 sec.
Somesite statistics are given in Fig.

The inter-face is supposed to be used only for short-wordqueries, but long queries are also submitted inhope that the system would do machine transla-tion.
As can be seen from the figure, the longestsubmitted query had the length of 4958 bytes.Still, the majority of the queries are below 100bytes: in 1999 there were 0.03% queries sub-1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 200495 love 522 love 854 love 1252 hello 1977 hello 607 hello95 hello 499 hello 756 hello 1205 love 1776 love 590 love70 you 346 you 521 you 892 you 1287 you 416 you57 devojka 215 good 324 good 487 i 707 good 259 i38 i 170 f. .

5.5 Conclusions and Future WorkWe have presented the features of an electronicEnglish-SC dictionary.
The dictionary is de-signed to be multi-functional, providing the in-terfaces to produce a printed dictionary copyand an on-line searchable lexicon.
We proposea dictionary structure inspired by the WordNet,which is flexible and easy to maintain.
We alsoreport the site statistics of the on-line dictionaryduring the last five years.Future work.
The plan for future work in-cludes incorporating a lemmatizer that wouldtranslate inflected word forms into their canoni-cal representations.
This is relevant for English,but it is a more important issue in SC, which is ahighly-inflectional language.
We do not know ofany lemmatizer or stemmer currently availablefor SC.
The software interfaces for producing awordnet form, and a TEI-encoded form will bedeveloped.
An issue of long queries needs to beaddressed.
Currently, if a user submits a longquery, which is usually a sentence or paragraph,the dictionary reports ?zero entries found.?
Afall-back strategy should be provided, which willconsist of tokenizing the input and giving theresults on querying separate lexemes.6 AcknowledgmentsWe thank Danko S?ipka, Dus?ko Vitas, andanonymous reviewers for helpful feedback.
