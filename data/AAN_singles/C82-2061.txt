L. Kar t tunen (Kar t tunen 1970, 1971) demonstrated thatin  Eng l i sh  there  ex is t  s ix  c lasses  of  p red icates  that  d i f fe ras fo r  the  re la t ionsh ips  ho ld ing  between the pred icate  and i t ssentent ia l  complement: fac t ives ,  pos i t i ve  and negat ive  two-wayimp l ioat ives ,  pos i t i ve  and negat ive  one-way imp l i ca t ives ,  andnon-determlnatlves.
H. 8ira (~im 1974) validated the classific-ation for the Estonian lansuage.
K & ~ drew their evidencefrom verbs and adjectives.
Now a question poses itself: do the ?principles underlying their classification hold also for~dverbs ,  and i f  yes ,  do they exh ib i t  any d i f fe rences  in  com-par i son  w i th  verbs  and ad jec t ives .According to  Kart tunen the re la t ionsh ip  between thepred icate  and i t s  sentent ia l  complement i s  determined by these~ant ics  of  the pred icate ,  and i t  can slwaye be computed i fthe  semant ic  c lass  o f  the pred icate  i s  known.
Together  wi thpresuppos i t ions  emsnt ic  in fe rences  form a subc lass  of  in fe r -ences w i th  two d i s t inc t  character i s t i cs  ( Josh i ,  Weisohedel1976),i) they are inferences that need to be made when analys-ing a sentence, i.e.
the problem of when and where to makewhat kind of inferences does not arise in case of them iii) they do not exhibit a "chain" reaction so character-istic of other kind of inferences the reason being that theystem from e i ther  the semant ic  s t ruc ture  o f  ind iv idua l  words or- 247 -the  par t i cu la r  synt .act ic  const ruc ts  of the  sentence ,  and there la t ionsh ips  hold w i th in  the cor respond ing  sentence .The problem of  making in fe rences  has always been a "sore"point in natural language understandin6 systems.
The mechanismof inferences discussed in this paper enables to reduce theamount, of computation needed and to make the interpretationof sentences more reliable.2.
With respect to their influence on the relationshipbetween the pred icate  and i t s  sentent ia l  complement th reec lasses  of  adverbs  may be d i f fe rent ia ted :  manner adverbs ,sentence  adverbs and complement -or iented  a verbs .2.1.
The behavior of manner adverbs (MA) and sentenceadverbs (SA) in the sentence is widely different:i) NA presuppose the truth of.
the embedded sentencewithout the correspondin6 MAz(1) John ~ ordered the boy to leave(2) John ordered the boy to leaveSome SA ( l i ke  "w ise ly" )  have the same facu l ty ,  some ( l i ke"probably" do not:(3) Wis_~2~, John ordered the boy to leave(4) Probabl.y John ordered the boy to leaveii) MA are within the scope of the sentence negationwhile SA have the negation always within their scope:(5) John did not answer the question quickly(6) John answered the question(7) Shortly, John did not answer the question(8) John did not answer the questionThus it can be seen that MA always behave like factives,whereas each SA must have an entry specifying whether i% be-haves like a fac~ive or like a non-determinative.- 248  -2.2 .
Complement-or iented a verbs (COA) do not funct ionon ly  to  mark the t ru th  va lue  of  the compliment (Lehrer  1975)but a l so  to change that  t ru th  va lue .

To wind up It must be said that adverbs do not poss-ess all the.
features characteristic of verbs and adjectives:they may function as faotlves (MA and some SA) or as positiveor negative one-way impllcatlves (COA), and even as suchtheir paradi@u is defective, e.g.
as one-way Impllcativesthey do not have any "neutral" form as the correspondingverbs and adjectives have.References :Josh/ A.K.
