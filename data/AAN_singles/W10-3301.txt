We implemen-ted a semantic tagging approach that per-forms off-line reasoning.
Mining of factsand  knowledge  is  achieved  through  aflexible pattern matching module that canwork in much the same way for differentlanguages,  can  handle  efficiently  largevolumes of documents and is not restric-ted to a specific domain.
We applied thesystem to an English database on estuar-ies.1 IntroductionTraditionally, Information Extraction (IE) is thetask of filling template information from previ-ously unseen text which belongs to a predefineddomain (Peshkin & Pfeffer 2003).
Most systemsin  the  Message  Understanding  Conferences(MUC,  1987-1998)  and the  Automatic  ContentExtraction  program  (ACE)1 use  a  pipeline  oftools to achieve this, ranging from sophisticatedNLP tools (like deep parsing) to shallower text-processing (e.g.
FASTUS (Appelt 1995)).Standard  IE  systems  are  based  on  lan-guage-specific  pattern  matching  (Kaiser  &1http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tests/aceMiksch 2005), where each pattern consists of aregular  expression  and  an  associated  mappingfrom syntactic to logical form.
In general, the ap-proaches can be categorized into two groups: (1)the Knowledge Engineering approach (Appelt etal.1995), and (2) the learning approach, such asAutoSlog  (Appelt  et  al.
1993),  SRV  (Freitag1998), or RAPIER (Califf & R. Mooney 1999).Another  important  system  is  GATE (Cunning-ham et al2002), which is a platform for creatingIE systems.
It uses regular expressions, but it canalso  use  ontologies  to  perform semantic  infer-ences  to  constrain  linguistic  patterns  semantic-ally.
The use of ontologies in IE is an emergingfield (Bontcheva & Wilks 2004): linking text in-stances with elements belonging to the ontology,instead of consulting flat gazetteers.The major disadvantage of traditional IE sys-tems is that they focus on satisfying precise, nar-row, pre-specified requests from small homogen-eous corpora (e.g., extract information about ter-rorist events).
Likewise, they are not flexible, arelimited to specific types of knowledge and needto be built by knowledge engineers for each spe-cific application and language.
In fact most textmining  systems are  developed for  a  single  do-main and a single language, and are not able tohandle  knowledge  expressed  in  different  lan-guages  or  expressed  and conceptualized  differ-ently across cultures.In this paper we describe an open platform fortext-mining  or  IE that  can  be applied  to manydifferent  languages  in  the  same  way  using  anopen text representation system and a central on-1tology that  is  shared across  languages.
Ontolo-gical implications are inserted in the text throughoff-line  reasoning and ontological  tagging.
Theevents and facts are extracted from large amountsof text using a flexible pattern-matching module,as specified by profiles  which comprise  ontolo-gical and shallow linguistic patterns.
The systemis  developed  in  the  Asian-European  projectKYOTO2.In the next section,  we describe the generalarchitecture of the KYOTO system.
In section 3,we specify the knowledge structure that is used.Section  4,  describes  the  off-line  reasoning  andontological tagging.
In section 5, we describe themodule for mining knowledge from the text thatis enriched with ontological  statements.
Finallyin section 6, we describe the first results of ap-plying the system to databases on Estuaries.2 KYOTO overviewThe  KYOTO  project  allows  communities  tomodel terms and concepts in their domain and touse this knowledge to apply text mining on docu-ments.
The knowledge cycle in the KYOTO sys-tem starts  with a set  of  source  documents pro-duced by the community, such as PDFs and web-sites.
Linguistic  processors  apply  tokenization,segmentation, morpho-syntactic analysis and  se-mantic  processing  to  the  text  in  different  lan-guages.
The semantic processing involves the de-tection of named-entities (persons, organizations,places,  time-expressions)  and  determining  themeaning of  words  in  the  text  according to  thegiven wordnet.The  output  of  the  linguistic  processors isstored in an XML annotation format that  is thesame for  all  the languages,  called  the KYOTOAnnotation  Format  (KAF,  Bosma  et  al  2009).This format incorporates standardized proposalsfor the linguistic annotation of text and representsthem in an easy-to-use layered structure, which iscompatible with the Linguistic Annotation Frame-work  (LAF,  Ide  and  Romary  2003).
In  KAF,words, terms, constituents and syntactic depend-encies  are  stored  in  separate  layers  with  refer-ences across the structures.
This makes it easierto harmonize the output of  linguistic processors2 Http://www.kyoto-project.eufor different languages and to add new semanticlayers to the basic output, when needed (Bosmaet al 2009, Vossen et al 2010).
All modules inKYOTO draw their input from these structures.In fact, the word-sense disambiguation process iscarried out to the same KAF annotation in differ-ent languages and is therefore the same for all thelanguages (Agirre et al 2009).
In the current sys-tem,  there  are  processors  for  English,  Dutch,Italian, Spanish, Basque, Chinese and Japanese.The KYOTO system proceeds in 2 cycles (seeFigure 1).
In the 1st cycle, the Tybot (Term Yield-ing Robot) extracts the most relevant terms fromthe documents.
The Tybot is another generic pro-gram that  can  do  this  for  all  the  different  lan-guages in much the same way.
The terms are or-ganized as a structured hierarchy and, whereverpossible,  related  to  generic  semantic  databases,i.e.
wordnets for each language.
In the left part ofFigure 1, we show those terms in the input docu-ment and their classification in wordnet.
Terms initalics are present in the original wordnet, whileunderlined terms correspond to terms which werenot in the original wordnet but were automatic-ally discovered and linked to wordnet by Tybots.Straight  terms  correspond  to hyperonyms  inwordnet that do not necessarily occur in the textbut are linked to ontological classes.
The result ofthis  1st cycle  is a domain wordnet  for the targetlanguage.The 2nd cycle of the system involves the actu-al extraction of factual knowledge from the docu-ments by the Kybots  (Knowledge Yielding Ro-bots).
Kybots use a collection of profiles that rep-resent patterns of information of interest.
In theprofile, conceptual relations are expressed usingontological  and morpho-syntactic linguistic pat-terns.
Since the semantics is defined through theontology,  it  is  possible  to  detect  similar  dataacross documents in different languages, even ifexpressed differently.
In Figure 1, we give an ex-ample of a conceptual pattern that relates organ-isms that live in habitats.
The Kybot can combinemorpho-syntactic and semantic patterns.
When amatch is detected, the instantiation of the patternis saved in a formal representation, either in KAFor in RDF.
Since the wordnets in different lan-guages are mapped to the same ontology and thetext in these languages is represented in the sameKAF,  similar  patterns  can  easily  be  applied  tomultiple languages.23 Ontological  and  lexical  backgroundknowledgeAs a semantic background model, we defined a3-layered  knowledge  architecture  following theprinciple  of  the  division  of  labour  (Putnam1975).
In this model, the ontology does not needto be the central hub for all terms in a domain inall  languages.
Following the division  of labourprinciple, we can state that a computer does notneed  to  distinguish  between  instances  of  aEuropean Tree Frog and a Glass Tree frog.
Weassume  that  rigid  concepts  (as  defined  byGuarino and Welty 2002) are known to the do-main experts and do not need to be defined form-ally in the ontology but can remain in the avail-able  background  resources,  such  as   databaseswith millions of species.
Terms in the documentsare mostly non-rigid, e.g.
endangered frogs,  in-vasive  frogs.
Such  non-rigid  terms  refer  to  in-stances  of  species  in  contextual  circumstances.The processes and states are the important piecesof  information  that  matter  to the users  and areuseful for mining text.
The model therefore dis-tinguishes between background vocabularies, do-main terms,  wordnets and the central  ontology.The  background  vocabularies  are  automaticallyaligned  to  wordnet,  where  we  assume  thathyponymy relations to rigid synsets in wordnetdeclare those subconcepts as rigid subtypes too,without the necessity to include them in the onto-logy.
For  non-rigid  terms,  we  defined  a  set  ofmapping relations to the ontology through whichwe express their non-rigid involvement in theseprocesses and states.
Likewise, the ontology hasbeen extended with processes and states for thedomain  and  verbs  and  adjectives  have  beenmapped to be able to detect expressions in text.The  3-layered  knowledge  model  combines  theefforts from 3 different communities:1.Domain  experts  in  social  communities  thatcontinuously build background vocabularies;2.Wordnet  specialists  that  define  the  basic  se-mantic model for general concepts for a lan-guage3.Semantic Web specialists that define top-leveland domain-specific ontologies that captureformal definitions of concepts;We formalized the relations between these repos-itories so that they can developed separately butcombined within KYOTO to form a coherent andformal model.3.1 OntologyThe KYOTO ontology currently consists of 1149classes divided over three layers.
The top layer isbased  on  DOLCE  (DOLCE-Lite-Plus  version3.9.7,  Masolo  et  al  2003)  and  OntoWordNet.This layer of the ontology has been modified forour purposes (Herold et.
al.
2009).
The secondlayer consists of so-called Base Concepts (BCs)derived  from various  wordnets  (Vossen  1998,Izquierdo  et  al.
2007).
Examples  of  BCs  are:building,  vehicle,  animal,  plant,  change,  move,size, weight.
The BCs are those synsets in Word-Net 3.0 that have the most relations with othersynsets in the wordnet hierarchies and are selec-ted in a way that ensures complete coverage ofthe nominal and verbal part of WordNet.
This hasbeen  completed  for  the  nouns  (about  500synsets).
The ontology has also been adapted toinclude important concepts in the domain.
Spe-cial attention has been paid to represents the pro-cesses  (perdurants)  in  which  objects  (endur-ants)  of  the domain are  involved and qualitiesthey may have.
This is typically the informationthat is found in documents on the environment.We thus added 40 new event classes for repres-enting  important  verbs  (e.g.
pollute, absorb,damage, drain) and 115 new qualities and qual-ity-regions for representing important adjectives(e.g.
airborne, acid, (un)healthy, clear).
The fullFigure 1: Two Cycles of processing in KYOTO3ontology can be downloaded from the KYOTOwebsite, free for use.
A considerable set of gener-al verbs and adjectives (relevant for for the do-main)  have  then  been  mapped  to  ontologicalclasses: 189  verbal  synsets  and  222  adjectivalsynsets.The  500  nominal  BCs  are  connected  to  thecomplete  WordNet  hierarchy,  whereas  the  189verbs represent 5,978 more specific verbal syn-sets and the 222 adjectives represent  1,081 ad-jectival synsets through the wordnet relations.This basic ontology and the mapping to Word-Net  are  used  to  model  the  shared  and  lan-guage-neutral  concepts  and  relations  in the do-main.
Instances are excluded from the ontology.Instances will be detected in the documents andwill be mapped to the ontology through instanceto ontology relations (see below).
Likewise, wemake a clear separation between the ontologicalmodel and the instantiation of the model as de-scribed in the text.3.2 Wordnet to ontology mappingsIn addition to the ontology, we have wordnets foreach language in the domain.
In addition to theregular synset to synset relations in the wordnet,we will have a specific set of relations for map-ping the synsets  to the ontology,  which are  allprefixed with sc_ standing for synset-to-concept.We differentiate between rigid and non-rigid con-cepts in the wordnets through the mapping rela-tions:?
sc_equivalenceOf: the synset is fully equi-valent to the ontology Type & inherits all proper-ties; the synset is Rigid?
sc_  subclassOf: the synset is a proper sub-class of the ontology Type & inherits all proper-ties; the synset is Rigid?
sc_domainOf: the synset is not a proper sub-class  of  the  ontology  Type  &  is  not  disjoint(therefore orthogonal) with other synsets that aremapped to the same Type either through sc_sub-classOf or sc_domainOf; the synset is non-Rigidbut still inherits all properties of the target onto-logy Type;  the synset  is  also related to a Rolewith a sc_playRole relation?
sc_playRole:  the  synset  denotes  instancesfor  which  the  context  of  the  Role  applies  forsome period of time but this is not essential forthe existence of the instances, i.e.
if the contextceases to exist then the instances may still exist(Mizoguchi et al 2007).3?
sc_participantOf:  instances of the concept(denoted by the synset) participate in some en-durant, where the specific role relation is indic-ated by the playRole mapping.?
sc_hasState: instances of the concept are ina particular state which is not essential and canbe changed.
There is no need to represent the rolefor a stative perdurant.This model  extends  existing  WordNet  to  onto-logy mappings.
For  instance,  in  the  SUMO toWordnet mapping (Niles and Pease 2003), onlythe  sc_equivalenceOf and  sc_subclassOf rela-tions  are  used,  represented  by  the symbols  ?=?and ?+?
respectively.
The SUMO-Wordnet map-ping likewise does not systematically distinguishrigid from non-rigid  synsets.
In our  model,  weseparate the linguistically and culturally specificvocabularies from the shared ontology while us-ing the ontology  to interface  the concepts usedby the various communities.Using these mapping relations, we can expressthat the synset for  duck (which has a hypernymrelation to the synset  bird, which, in its turn, hasan  equivalence  relation  to  the  ontology  classbird) is  thus  a  proper  subclassOf  the  ontologyclass bird:wn:duck hypernym wn:birdwn:bird  sc_equivalenceOf ont:birdFor a concept such as migratory bird, which isalso  a  hyponym of  bird in  wordnet  but  not  aproper subclass as a non-rigid concept, we thuscreate the following mapping:wn:migratory bird?
sc_domainOf ont:bird?
sc_playRole ont:done-by?
sc_participantOf ont:migrationThis mapping indicates that the synset is used torefer to instances of endurants (not subclasses!
),where the domain is restricted to birds.
Further-more, these instances participate in the process of3 Some terms involve more than one role,  e.g.
gas-powered-vehicle.
Secondary  participants  are  relatedthrough  sc_hasCoParticipant and sc_playCoRolemappings.4migration in the role of  done-by.
The propertiesof  the  process  migration are  further  defined  inthe  ontology,  which  indicates  that  it  is  a  act-ive-change-of-location  done-by  some  endurant,going from a source, via a path to some destina-tion.
The mapping relations from the wordnet tothe ontology, need to satisfy the constraints of theontology, i.e.
only roles can be expressed that arecompatible with the role-schema of the processin which they participate.For  implied  non-essential  states,  we  use  thesc_hasState relation to express that a synset suchas wild dog refers to instances of dogs that life inthe wild but can stop being wild:wn:wild dog ?
sc_domainOf ont:dogwn:wild dog ?
sc_hasState ont:wildIdeally, all processes and states that can be ap-plied to endurants should be defined in the onto-logy.
This may hold for most verbs and adject-ives in languages, which do not tend to extend inspecific  domains  and  are  part  of  the  generalvocabulary  (e.g.
to  pollute,  to  reduce,  wild).However, domain specific text contain many newnominal terms that refer to domain-specific pro-cesses and states, e.g.
air pollution, nitrogen pol-lution,  nitrogen  reduction.
These  terms  areequally relevant as their counter-parts that referto endurants involved in similar  processes, e.g.polluted air, polluting nitrogen or reduced nitro-gen. We therefore use the reverse participant androle mappings to be able to define such terms forprocesses  as  subclasses  of  more  general  pro-cesses  involving  specific  participants  in  a  spe-cified role:wn:air pollution?
sc_subcassOf ont:pollution (perdurant)?
sc_hasParticipant ont:air?
sc_hasRole ont:patientwn:nitrogen pollution?
sc_subcassOf ont:pollution (perdurant)?
sc_hasParticipant ont:nitrogen?
sc_hasRole ont:done-byFurther  mapping  relations  are  described  in  thedocumentation on the KYOTO website.
Throughthe mapping relations, we can keep the ontologyrelatively small and compact whereas we can stilldefine  the  richness  of  the  vocabularies  of  lan-guages in a precise way.
The classes in the onto-logy can be defined using rich axioms that modelprecise implications for inferencing.
The wordnetto synset mappings can be used to define ratherbasic relations relative to the given ontology thatstill  captures  the  semantics  of  the  terms.
Theterm definitions capture both relevance and per-spective  (those  relations  that  matter  from  thepoint of the view of the term), on the one hand,and some semantics with respect to the conceptsthat are involved and their (role) relation on theother  hand.
Likewise,  the  KYOTO  system canmodel the linguistic and cultural diversity of lan-guages in a domain but at the same time keep afirm anchoring to a basic and compact ontology.3.3 Domain wordnetWe selected 3 representative documents on estu-aries to extract relevant terms for the domain us-ing the Tybot module.
The terms have been re-lated  through  structural  relations,  e.g.
nitrogenpollution is a hyponym of pollution, and throughWordNet synsets that are assigned through WSDof the text.
We extracted 3950 candidate  termsform the KAF representations of the documents.Most of these are nouns (2818 terms).
The nom-inal  terms matched for 40% with wordnet syn-sets, the verbs and adjectives for 98% and 85%respectively.
For the domain wordnet, we restric-ted ourselves to the nouns.
From the new nomin-al  terms,  environmentalists selected  390  termsthat they deem to be important.
These terms areconnected to parent terms, which ultimately areconnected to wordnet synsets.
The final domainwordnet contains 659 synsets: 197 synsets fromthe generic wordnet and 462 new synsets connec-ted to the former.
The domain wordnet synsetsgot 990 mappings to the ontology, using the rela-tions described in the previous section.
There are86 synsets that have a sc_domainOf mapping, in-dicating  that  they  are  non-rigid.
Note  thathyponyms of these synsets are also non-rigid bydefinition.
These non-rigid synsets have complexmappings to processes and states in which  theyare involved.
The domain wordnet can be down-loaded from the KYOTO website, free for use.54 Off-line reasoning and ontological tag-gingThe ontological tagging represents the last phasein the KYOTO Linguistic  Processor  annotationpipeline.
It  consists  of  a three-step module  de-vised to enrich the KAF documents with know-ledge derived from the ontology.
For each synsetconnected to a term, the first step   adds the BaseConcepts to which the synset is related throughthe wordnet taxonomical relations.
Then, throughthe synset to ontology mapping, it  adds the cor-responding ontology type with appropriate rela-tions.
Once each synset is specified as to its onto-logy type,  the  last  ontotagging  step  inserts  thefull  set  of  ontological  implications  that  followfrom the explicit ontology.
The explicit ontologyis a new data  structure consisting of a table withall  ontology nodes and all  ontological  implica-tions expressed.

The advantage for Ky-bots from ontotagging are many.
First of all, theyare  able  to  run  and  apply  pattern-matching  toBase  Concepts  and  ontological  classes  ratherthan just to words or synsets.
Moreover, by mak-ing explicit  the  implicit  ontological  statements,Kybots are able to find the same relations hiddenin  different  expressions  with  different  surfacerealizations:  fish migration,  migratory  fish,  mi-gration of fish, fishes that migrate, that directlyor indirectly express the same relations.
With on-totagging,  they  share  the  same ontological  im-plications which will allow Kybots to apply thesame patterns and perform the extraction of facts.The implications will be represented in the sameway across different languages, thus facilitatingcross-lingual extraction of facts.
Lastly, ontotag-ging is a kind of off-line ontological reasoning:without  doing reasoning over concepts,  Kybotssubstantially  improve their  performance.
Figure2 shows the result of onto-tagging for the termpollution.5 Event and fact extractionKybots (Knowledge Yielding Robots) are  com-puter  programs  that  use  the  minedconcepts and the generic  concepts  already con-nected to the language wordnets and the KYOTOontology to extract actual concept instances andrelations in KAF documents.
Kybots incorporatetechnology  for  the  extraction  of  relationships,either eventual or not, relative to the general ordomain concepts already captured by the Tybots.That is, the extraction of factual knowledge is be-ing carried out by the Kybot server by processingKybot profiles on the linguistically enriched doc-uments.Kybots  are  defined  following  a  declarativeformat,  the  so  called  Kybotprofiles, which describe general morpho-syntact-ic  and  semantic  conditions  on  sequences  ofterms.
Profiles are compiled to generate the Ky-bots, which scan over KAF documents searchingfor the patterns and extract the relevant informa-tion from each matching.Linguistic  patterns  include morphologic  con-straints and also semantic conditions the matchedterms must hold.
Kybot are thus able to searchfor term lemmas or part-of-speech tags but alsofor terms linked to ontological process and statesusing  the  mappings  described  in  Section  3.2.Thus, it is possible to detect similar eventual in-formation  across  documents  in  different  lan-guages, even if expressed differently.5.1 Example of a Kybot ProfileKybot Profiles are described using XML syn-tax.
Figure 3 presents an example of a profile.Kybot profiles consist of three main parts:?Variable  declaration (<variables> element):In this section the search entities are defined.
Theexample  defines  three  variables:  x (denotingterms  whose  part-of-speech is  noun),  y (whichare  terms whose lemma is ?release?, ?produce?or  ?generate?
but   not  ?create?)
and  z (termslinked to  the  ontological  endurant  ?DOLCE-L-ite.owl#contamination_pollution?, meaning ``be-ing contaminated with harmful  substances'').
?Declarations  of  the  relations  among  variables(<rel> element): specify the relations among thepreviously  defined variables.
The example pro-file specifies y  as the main pivot, and states thatvariable  x must  be  preceding  variable  y in  thesame sentence, and that variable  z must be fol-lowing variable  y.
Thus,  the Kybot will  searchfor patterns like 'x ?
y ?
z' in a sentence.
?Output template (<events> element): describesthe output to be produced on every matching.
Inthe example, each match generates a new eventtargeting term  y,  which becomes the main termof the event.
It also fills two roles of the event,the 'agent' role filled by term x and 'patient' role,filled by z.Figure  4  presents  the  output  of  the  Kybotwhen applied against the benchmark documents.The Kybot output follows the stand-off architec-ture when producing new information, and it thusforms  a  new KAF layer  on  the  original  docu-ments.6 Experimental resultsWe applied the KYOTO system and resources toEnglish documents on estuaries.
We collected 50URLs for two English estuaries: the Humber Es-tuary in Hull (UK) and the Chesapeake Bay estu-ary in the US and for background documents onbird  migration,  sedimentation,  habitat  destruc-tion,  and  climate  change.
In  addition  to  thewebpages, we extracted 815 PDF files from thesites.
In total, 4625 files have been extracted.
All7the documents have been processed by the lin-guistic  processor  for  English,  which  generatedKAF representations for all the documents.
Fromthis  database,  3  documents  were  selected  forbenchmarking.The  documents  were  processed  by  applyingmultiword  tagging,  word-sense-disambiguation,named-entity-recognition  and  the  ontologicaltagging to the 3 documents and to the completedatabase; This was done twice: once without thedomain model and once with the domain model.We thus created 4 datasets:  3 benchmark docu-ments  processed  with  and  without  the  domainmodel; the complete database processed with andwithout the domain model.Furthermore, we created Kybot profiles basedon the type of information represented in the do-main model.
We applied the Kybots to all 4 datasets.
We generate the following data files throughan WN-LMF export of the domain wordnet:1. a set of domain multiwords for the multi-word tagger2.
an extension of the lexicon and the graphof  concepts  that  is  used  by  the  WSDmodule3.
an extension of the wordnet-to-ontologymappings for the ontotaggerIn addition, we constructed mapping lists for allWordNet 3.0 synsets to Base Concepts and to ad-jective and verbs that are matched to the onto-logy.
These mappings provide the generic  con-ceptual model based on wordnet and on the onto-logy.Table 1 shows the effects of using the domainmodel for the first 3 modules.
We can see that thedomain  model  has  a  clear  effect  on  the multi-word  detection  in  the  3  evaluation  documents.Using the domain model,  600 multiwords havebeen detected, against 145 with just the genericwordnet.
This is obvious since the terms are ex-tracted  from  the  same  documents.
However,when applying it  to the complete  database,  wesee that  still  over 2,300 more multiwords havebeen  detected  using  the domain wordnet.
Notethat the domain wordnet has only 97 multiwordsand the generic wordnet has 19,126 multiwords.So 0.5% of the multiwords in the domain word-net add 1.5 times more multiword tokens in thedatabase.
The third row specifies the number ofsynsets that have been assigned.
We can see thatfor the domain model almost 400 more synsetshave been detected.
In the case of the full estuarydatabase, we see that relatively few more havebeen detected, almost 1,500 while the database is80 times as big.
If we look more closely at thenumbers of actual  domain synsets detected,  wesee the following results.
In the benchmark docu-ments  637 (or 5%) of  the synsets  is  a  domainwordnet  synset,  whereas  5,353 synsets  are  do-main synsets in the full estuary database, whichis only 0.52%.
Note that in KAF multiwords arerepresented both as a single terms and in terms oftheir elements.
The WSD module assigns synsetsto  both.
The  domain  model  can  thus  only  addsynsets compared to the processing without thedomain.Finally, if we look at the named-entity-recogni-tion module, we see a slight negative effect forthe detection of named-entities due to the domainmodel.
The  named-entity-recognition  moduledoes not consider the elements of multiwords butjust  the multiword terms as a whole.
Groupingterms  as  multiwords  thus  leads  to  less  named-entities being detected.
This is not necessarily abad things, since the detection heavily over-gen-erates and could have now more precision.Table 1: Statistics on processing the estuary documents with and without domain modelbench mark documents (3) estuary documents (4742)No Domain Domain No Domain Domainterms 22,204 22,204 2,419,839 2,419,839multiwords 145 600 4,389 6,67112,526 12,910 1,021,598 1,023,017158 126 41,681 40,71467 66 10,288 10,233synsetsne locationne date8Table 2 shows the effect of inserting ontologic-al  implications  into  the  text  representation.Forthe benchmark documents, we see that more thanhalf a million ontological implications have beeninserted.
Of  these, 82% are implied references,that are extracted from the explicit ontology onthe  basis  of  a  direct  mapping to  the  ontology.About  8% of  the  mappings  are  synset-to-onto-logy mappings (sc) and 9.5% are mappings rep-resenting the subclass hierarchy.
The differencesbetween using the domain model and not-usingthe domain model are minimal.
For the completedatabase, the implications are 80 times as muchbut the proportions are similar.Table 3 shows the type of sc-relations that oc-cur.
Obviously,  sc_subClassOf  and  sc_equival-entOf  are  the  most  frequent.
Nevertheless,  westill  find  about  500  mappings  that  present  theparticipation in a process or state.30  reftype="sc_playCoRole"32  reftype="sc_hasCoParticipant"42  reftype="sc_partOf"59  reftype="sc_stateOf"92  reftype="sc_playRole"94  reftype="sc_hasRole"97  reftype="sc_participantOf"105  reftype="sc_hasParticipant"128  reftype="sc_domainOf"169  reftype="sc_hasState"312  reftype="sc_hasPart"3637  reftype="sc_equivalentOf"42048  reftype="sc_subClassOf"Table 3: Type of relations for the wordnet to ontologymappings using the domain modelThe table clearly shows the impact of role rela-tions  that  are  encoded  in  the  domain  wordnet.When  we  extract  the  mappings  for  the  fileswithout the domain model (ony using the map-pings to the generic wordnet), we get only equi-valence and subclass mappings.Finally to complete the knowledge cycle, we cre-ated a few Kybot profiles for extracting eventsfrom the  onto-tagged  documents.
As  an  initialtest, 3 profiles have been created:1. events of destruction2.
destructions of locations3.
destruction of objectsUsing  these  profiles,  we  extracted  211  eventsfrom the 3 benchmark documents with 396 roles.The profiles are created to run over the ontolo-gical  types  inserted  by  the  ontotagger,  e.g.
re-stricted to events and change_of_integrity.
Des-pite the generality of the profiles, we still see aclear signature of the domain in the output.
Thisis a good indication that we will be able to ex-tract valuable events from the data, even thoughthe  ontotagger  generates  a  massive  amount  ofimplications.
Especially  events  that  combinemultiple  roles  appear  to  give  rich  information.For example, the following sentence:"One of the greatest challenges to restoration is con-tinued population growth and development, whichdestroys forests, wetlands and other natural areas"yielded the following output:<event target="t1471" lemma="destroy" pos="V"eid="e74"/><role target="t1477" rtype="patient" lemma="area"pos="N" event="e74" rid="r138"/><role target="t1472" rtype="patient"lemma="forest" pos="N" event="e74" rid="r151"/><role target="t1469" rtype="actor" lemma="devel-opment" pos="N" event="e74" rid="r180"/>Running the full set of profiles on the complete data-base with almost 60 million ontological statementstook about 2 hours.
This shows that our approach isscalable and efficient.Table 2: Ontological implications for the four data setsbench mark documents (3) estuary documents (4272No Domain Domain Domainontology references 555,677 576,432 48,708,300implied ontology references 457,332 82.30% 474,916 82.39% 40,523,452 83.20%direct ontology references 53,178 9.57% 54,769 9.50% 4,377,814 8.99%45,167 8.13% 46,747 8.11% 3,807,034 7.82%domain synset to ontology mappings97 ConclusionsIn this paper, we described an open platform fortext-mining  using wordnets  and a central  onto-logy.
The  system  can  be  used  across  differentlanguages and can be tailored to mine any type ofconceptual relations.
It can handle semantic im-plications that are expressed in very different lin-guistic expressions and yield systematic output.As future work, we will carry out benchmarkingand testing of the mining of events, both for Eng-lish and for the other languages in the KYOTOproject.AcknowledgementsThe KYOTO project is co-funded by EU - FP7ICT Work Programme 2007 under Challenge 4 -Digital  libraries  and  Content,  Objective  ICT-2007.4.2  (ICT-2007.4.4):  Intelligent  Contsentand Semantics  (challenge 4.2).
