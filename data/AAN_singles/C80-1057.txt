.A contract with LON@IAN Ltd has made itpossible for us to have access to the computerfiles of two dictionaries, LDOCE (LONDONDICTIONARY OF CONTF~IPORARY ENGLISH) and LDOEI(LON(~IAN DICTIONAI~OF ENGLISII IDIOMS).
I%have had the LDOCE file for some time but haveonly just received the LDOEI one.spe~c~aThe features LDOCE make of  which itlly useful for language processing arethe following :a) it reflects the surface structureenvironment of its entries by means of asophisticated system of grammatical codes,most of which can be thought of as strictsubcategorization features.
For instance,IDOCE specifiesi.- that nouns like FACT or CLAIM can befollowed by a THAT-clause,2.- that a verb such as WATCH can occur follo-wed by an NP followed by an ING-form (wewatched the soldiers bleeding).Though it is mainly concerned withSURFACE structure, LDOCE nevertheless distin-guishes between an NP pair follow in~ GIVE (HegaveJhi.s b.rotl!e~la new bicycle) \[DJcodeNP I N 2and one following CO~SIDER (He consideredthis brother, a f ~ )  ~X1lcodeT NP 1 NP 2 - -b) through a system of semantic codes ofthe Katz-and-Fodor type (these codes do ~mtappear in the printed version of the d ict iona-ry),  LDOCE places semantic res t r i c t ions  on thesubjects and objects of verbs (or on the typeof noun that an adject ive can modify), speci-  + ing for instance that PERSUADE requires a t~A~ object ,  and EXTFNPORIZE a \[+ ItU~4AN~subject.c) LDOCE makes use of a defining vocabula-ry of some 2,000 items - all the definitionsand all the examples associated with the 60,000entries are couched in that restricted vocabu-lary.Concerning points a and b it should beemphasized that the gra~natical and semanticcodes can appear at two different levels :i.- ENTRY level : the code is appropriate toall the definitions of the entry in ques-tion,2.- DEFINITION level : the code is not appro-priate to the whole entry (i.e.
in all itssenses) but only to those readings thatcorrespond to the definitions that thecode is tagged to.For instance, READ cannot be assigned thesame grammatical and semantic codes in senten-ces 1 and 2 :1.-  He rnana~e~ tr~ ro.ad nt \]~a.~t r~no honkevery day2.- Your paper doesn't  read too well.This second level makes i t  possible toavoid a pro l i fe ra t ion  of indiscriminate d is -junctions in the spec i f icat ion of the codes tobe associated with a given lexeme.
It seems tous that by restricting the occurrence of codespecifications at only one level (nmnely, the374i~NTRY level), one reduces the predictive powerof both grammatical and semantic codes topractically nil in the case of complex entries.On the ot\]~r hand, the codes that are appro-priate at DEFINITION level provide an interes-ting type of correlation between strict sub-categorization and selection rules on the onehand and choice of appropriate reading on theother : such a type of correlation is bound toprove very useful for machine translation pur-poses.voc~au ~ing  to the use of the same defininglary, LDOEI is a natural extension ofLDOCE.
Whereas the latter merely lists theidiomatic phrases under the relevant headwords,LDOEI gives the information necessary for re-cognizing and generating all the syntactic andmorphological variants of each idi~n.
To giveonly one example, in the entry "TELL ?
I WHERETO GET OFF IV : Pass 2\]" the sign o indicatesthat ~LL  admits of morphological variationin this phrase, I specifies the place of theindirect object (which does not belong to theidiomatic phrase as such) and the grammaticalnote iV : Pass 2Jinforms the user that thesyntactic value of the ~4~ole phrase is verbal(i. e. that it functions as a VP) and that thepassive is to be formed by selecting theindirect object as subject (,'Ib was told whereto get off").
(LONGMAN LEXICON)~\] is  forthcoming thesaurus is alsodesigned to t ie  in with LDOCE, of  which i t  ispar t ly  a by-product.
As Section I I I  wi l l  makeclear, our analysis of LDOCE definitions willhave to rely on a thesaurus, but we do notknow yet whether LOLEX will be available inmachine-readable form.SECTION II.
TOWAPd)S A S~4ANTICALLY ENRICI~JDSURFACE PARSER BASED ON LDOCEI .
-  ~_!~!~!
!z_~_~.It stands to reason that automatic parsingprogrammes have to have access to at least twolinguistic components : a grammar and a lexicon.In most systems that we know somethingabout, the gra~nar is a good deal more sophis-ticated than the lexicon.
The latter includesonly a small sub-part of the total lexicon forthe language under study, while the grsmartakes care of a large proportion of the basicgran~natical structures.We would like to explore a diametricallyopposed approach : our starting-point is asophisticated lexicon for co:re English and ouraim is to make maximum use of the informationit contains to keep our grmmnar within strictbounds.An obvious first step in developing aparser based on LDOCE is to write algorithmsthat translate the various grammatical codesinto scanning procedures .
Most of these algo-rithms are fairly straightforward and havealready been written.
What we would like tofocus on here is the simplification of the cate-gorial component that such a lexically basedsyntax permits.
Consider 3 :3.
The claim that he has succeeded is patent-ly false.
Since there is a code (namely, 5 )that stipulates whether an element (in thiscase, a countable noun coded C - the wholecode is therefore \[~51 ) can be followed by a~IAT-clause, we will not attempt to accountfor T~T-clauses via rewrite rules for the cate-gory NP, i. e. we won't have such a rule as :NP---~NP ~T SNaturally enough, there is no LDOCE code sti-pulating that a noun can be followed by a rela-tive clause (such a code would be meaninglesssince virtually all nouns can have a relativeclause - if not a restrictive, thln at least anappositive one - tagged on their right).
We willtherefore have to include relative clauses some-where in our rewrite rules for the category NP.Here too, however, the lexical approach to syn-tax can prove useful.
To show this, let usfirst define a CONCATENATION as a string everymember of which is tied to some other by meansof a LDOCE grammatical code (it requires theother member for the satisfaction of its codeor it serves to satisfy the other member'scode).
The concept of CONCATENATION can beequated with that of CLAUSE if it is extendedto cover :i.- free elements, i, e. elements which are notbound to one particular word or phrase in-side the clause (both sentential adjunctsand linking words such as conjunctionswould fall into this category).2.- a subject role, i. e. the creation of alink between a tensed V (the starting-pointfor the concatenation - see below) and anNP to be found on its right or on its left.We have already looked into the mechanismsof tensed V searches and subject role assign-ments and we have found that various propertiesof English make the task of algorithmizingthese mechanisms less formidable than itappears at first sight.
The most prominentamong these properties are the following :I.- the conditions of use of the auxiliary DO;2.- the fact that only tensed Vs require asubject;3.- the fact that only the first (i. e. left-most) member of a verbal ~roup can beartense;4.- the fact that it must bear tense;S.- the morphological contrast between verb andnoun with respect to m~ber (- S marks sin-gular verbs but plural nouns).Turning now to relative clauses, we seethat we can characterize them with great ease :a relative clause is s concatenation that openswith a relative phrase (one of whose realiza-tions is ~ and another the multi-purpose wordTHAT, so that a recognition procedure based on375-the occurrence of particular morphemes is boundto fail in some cases) and that misses an NP(it is this second property that has to be re-garded as essential).The readers who are familiar with Hudson1976 will have realized that the approachadvocated here is nearer to Hudson's version ofsystemic gra~nar than to transfornmtional gram-mar : we make full use of sister-dependencies,starting with the tensed V, which we believe toprovide the best entry-point into the networkof relationships woven by the various code-bearing elements in a sentence.II.- _Dee_~_st~Ljcture_conf_igkjratitins _.It is obvious that our parser will have tobe able to :I.- recognize the situations in which the basicorder of the constituents (i. e. the onestipulated in the scanning procedures asso-ciated with the gra~atical codes) is dis-rupted under the effect of transformationssuch as PASSIVIZATION, TOPICALIZATION,PJ~LATIVE CLAUSE FOt~IATION, GAPPING, .
.
.
)2.- keep track of the constituents that havebeen moved.We do not intend to deal with thesepoints here but we would like to stress thatthe problems for RECOGNITION are very differentfrom those for GENERATION.
RAISING and EQUI,for instance, are rather formidable andproblem-ridden rules from the point of viewof generation but we shall argue that we do notneed their counterparts for recognition pur-poses.
We shall illustrate this point by look-ing at verb complementation - at the same timewe will show that the syntactic potential of averb can be used as a guide to its deepstructure configuration.In a VP the SYNTACTIC head is always thefirst, i. e. tensed verb.
As we have seen, theway the parser builds up concatenations re-flects this property.
As for the SEMANTIC head,it is very often another verb than the firstone.
This, however, does not matter in so far asthe auxiliaries and semi-m~xiliaries (IIAPPiZ~4,SEEM, ...) do not have any semantic code asso-ciated with them and can therefore be regardedas semantically transparent : they have noeffect whatsoever on the pailts that thesemantic component will be called on to examinefor compatibility.
Consider such a sentenceas4  :4.- b{y father seems to have been reading toomany strips.11-te starting-point for building theconcatenation would be the tensed V, i. e.SED{S : the concatenation would be allowed togrow both to the left (assigrunent of subjectrole to the NP 'my father') and to the right :he~appropriate syntactic code for SEI~,IS is3J here (i. e. followed by an infinitivewith TO) : g .~ub~j  e~t fathers s e e m ~NP/ ~atisf igs g3 \ ]  code of SED.~SSI!Di is not coded semantically, so that thesemantic component would not be called on atthis stage.
In the next step, IIAVE would beexamined and its ~I ~ code seen to beapplicable ~ 8Jspecifies that the code-bearingelement be followed by an EN-form) so that anew sister dependency would be established :_ .
/4-- -~ ~My father seems to have |been Jsa~tisfies CI 8J code of HAVEIn similar fashion, BEEN would have an~13~ code (i. e. + ING-form) satisfied byIIEADING :!ly lather seems to nave been readingNeither HAVE nor BE are semanticallycoded with restrict to the definitions that havebeen chosen onYDasis of the grammatical codesthat are satisfied in the sentence .~ READINGon the other hand, will be coded sy~ttactically(it requires one NP as object-code ~Ti| ) andsemantically (it requires a ~ ~ANJ  subject).Since SED4, HAVE and BEEN are semanticallytransparent, the semantic component will exa-mine the pair ~JX father and re.ading and findthem to be compatible as a subject-verb configu-ration.
But how does the parser know thatfathe__j is the subject of reading ?
A verysimple-minded rule states that there is nochange in subject in a verbal complex as longas there is no interrupting NP; if there is one,it is to be regarded as the subject of thefollowing verb(s) :I want to read -~I started to read ~ subject of READ"i happened to be reading.Y want g~.
to ready ~"I saw you read ing~you subject of READI made ~ readThis rule admits of at least one exception,namely PROMISE :I promised you to read (I subject of READin spite of interrupting YOU).Another problem relating to deep structureconfigurations is that of determining, inv + NP + J (TO) + INFINrrIVE l+ ING-FOR~ Jstructures, whether the NP is to be regarded asthe object of the V or not (contrast 'I wanthim to go' with 'I persuaded him to go').Instead of going into each deep structuredistinction that can be drawn within the fieldof verb complementation, we will show that theverb classes which Akmajian and Heny 1975(p. 364 and fell.)
find it necessary to set upin their introduction to transformationalgrammar to account for deep structure distinc-tions (Figure i) can be held apart on thebasis of their surface structure potential ascaptured in their LDOCE gran~natical codes.Figure 1A1qnajian and Heny's verb classesSee appendix I .376-The raised numbers on the features inthe matr ix  below refer to the fo l lowingl ist of test sentences :I.

Even though all def in i -t ions are wr i t ten in a DEFINING VOCABU-LARY (not to be confused with a BASICVOCABULARY - see below), no at tempt hasbeen made to stick to a l imited numberof DEFINING FORMULAE.
To g ivean  exampleof what we mean by DEFINING FORMULA, andto ant ic ipate  on what wi l l  be the mainconcern of this section, we wish to lookat the class of INSTRUMENTS.
In theory,it could be agreed by the d ic t ionary-makers that all inst ruments  have toinclude the phrase " instrument  used forVing" in their def in i t ions .
In such adef in ing formula the word INSTRUMENTwould be a DEFINING PR IMIT IVE  and thepred icate  USED FOR would be a DEFININGRELATION (in this case, between aninstrument  and a predicate) .
Such a kindof formatted def in i t ion  would be lessprec ise and less exact, but inf in i te lymore usable, than a common type def in i -tion.
Smith and Maxwel l  1973 (p2) pointout that in a typical  d ic t ionaryapprox imate ly  50 % of the vocabularyappears in the def in i t ions .
LDOCE is amajor improvement  on such a typicald ic t ionary  in that its def in ing--377--vocabulary  is restr ic ted to some 2,000items (used to def ine some 60,000entr ies).
My purpose in this sect ion isto ref lect  on the poss ib i l i ty  ofturning a s ign i f i cant  number of LDOCEdef in i t ions  into ful ly formatted ones(i.e.
making use of def in ing formulae).Consider the sentence :I saw the man in the park with ate lescope\ [Woods  in Rust in 1973, p. 17~The PREFERRED reading is the one thatassoc iates  'with a telescope' with thepred icate  'saw' rather than with eitherof the NP heads 'man' or 'park' : 'sawwith a telescope' rather than 'man witha telescope' or 'park with a telescope'.If we had ava i lab le  a formatted def in i -t ion of TELESCOPE (" instrument used forseeing ..."), there would be noprob lem in a system of p re ferent ia lsemant ics  : the l ink between 'saw' and'telescope' (embodied in the def in i t ionof the latter) would lead to these lect ion of the pre fer red reading onthe basis of the DENSEST MATCH FIRSTpr inc ip le.
As a matter of fact, theLDOCE def in i t ion  for 'telescope' isvery near ly  what we need :"a tubel ike sc ient i f ic  instrumentused for seeing d is tant  ob jects  bymaking them appear nearer andlarger"A s imple matching procedure  between oursuggested def in ing formula forinstruments  and the LDOCE def in i t ionfor 'telescope' would have beensuf f ic ient  in this case.
The problem,of course, is that there is abso lute lyno guarantee that the def in ing formulawi l l  be part of the def in i t ion  of allinstruments.
HAMMER, for instance, isdef ined as :"a tool with a heavy head fordr iv ing nai ls into wood or forstr ik ing things to break them ormove them" (Def in i t ion I)No simple procedure wi l l  assoc iateINSTRUMENT with HAMMER.
The fact thatLDOCE makes use of a def in ing vocabu-lary, however,  ensures that the definingnoun (TOOL in this case) is a member ofa f in ite list, namely the LDOCE definingvocabulary  itself.
One can go a stepfurther and make the hypothes is  thatthe def in ing noun wi l l  belong to adef in i te  subset wi th in  the def in ingvocabulary.
One can go through thatvocabulary  and select  the words thatcould stand for INSTRUMENTS.
The subsetthat this procedure y ie lds can fair lyeas i ly  be d iv ided into two furthergroups : on the one hand one f indssuch genera l  words as TOOL and APPARATUS(note that the latter would not beincluded in a BASIC VOCABULARY) whichcould also be used in def in ing formulae;on the other hand one has to includesuch speci f ic  items as BOAT, B ICYCLEand GUN, which are instances of instru-ments.
The second group is of coursemuch more prob lemat ic  than the f i rst  :one has to be concerned with TYPICALinstruments,  o therw ise  all PHYSICALOBJECTS would have to be included :He hit her with the tail of a deadsnake.The INSTRUMENT reading of the 'with' -phrase is not due to any intr ins icproperty  of either 'tail' or 'snake',but rather to four factors :--378--a) WITH often introduces an instrumentaladjunct;b) the 'with' -phrase in this sentencecannot be read as postmodi fy ing'her';c) it cannot  be read as an accompanimentadjunct  for 'he' either;d) the pred icate  'hit' can take aninstrumental  adjunct.The reader wi l l  have not iced thatfactors a, c and d also apply - mutatismutandis  - to the example involving thepredicate SEE.
This, however, does notimply that the link between TELESCOPEand SEE was of no use in preferr ing theinstrument reading for the 'with'-phrase - note that 'with a telescope'COULD postmodi fy  the NP heads 'man' and'park'; besides, even if it could not,we would sti l l  have to find a way oftel l ing the system and this task maywel l  prove cons iderab ly  more formidablethan that of assoc iat ing instrumentsand predicates.The fo l lowing items in the LDOCEdef in ing vocabulary  could be regardedas making up the subset for theconcept  INSTRUMENT :GROUP IapparatusinstrumentmachinemachinerymeansorgantoolGROUR IIarm \ [R \ ]arms CR~armyarrowaxebeakGROUP II (continued)belt  gun prayerb icycle hammer proofboat hand \[R~ pumpboot handle \[R\] radiobrain hook rai lwaybrick key roadbridge knife rodbrush knot roofbul let  ladder ropebus lamp sailbutton law scalescamera letter scissorscandle map screwcar mat servant ~R\]card medic ine shieldcart message shoechain microscope signcoin mirror s ignalcomb motor \[R\] slave \[R~control  \[R\] nail spadecover needle springcurta in  network stairsdrum pan stoneengine \[R\] pen str ingfactory pin supportfence plane swordfork poison systemgate pole taxigift  post te lephoneglass pot te legramtelegraphte lev is ionthreadthumbt ickettoothtraintrapvehic leweapon \[R\]w~lwhipwhist leNOTESI.
For all items in both groups,POS (Part of Speech) = n2.
All items in Group I - except MEANS,which is itself a head - appearunder the head TOOL in Roget'sThesaurus.3.
In Group II the items fol lowed by\ [R \ ]  occur in Roger's Thesaurus underthe head TOOL.--379--4.
The under l ined items in Group II aremore general  and could perhaps bes ingled out in a third group,intermediate between I and II.Obviously,  the l ists as such are notsuf f ic ient  for our purpose  : words suchas SPRING and MEDICINE are not re levantto the INSTRUMENT concept in some oftheir most f requent  uses - for ourpurposes the def in ing vocabulary  shouldnot have been l imited to a l ist ofLEXICAL ITEMS; in case of po lysemicwords, numbers should have been addedto make clear which def in i t ions  were tobe assoc iated with the def in ing word :SPRING I (= a source), 2 (= a season),4 (= elast ic i ty) ,  5 (= an act iveheal thy quality) and 6 (= an act ofspr inging),  are not re levant  to theINSTRUMENT concept.
Since - in theory -the noun SPRING can be used with allsix meanings in LDOCE def in i t ions,  itsinc lus ion in our l ist is l iable toprove detr imenta l  : it can lead thesystem to assoc iate the INSTRUMENTconcept  with a def in ing word that hasnothing to do with instrumental i ty ?Going back to the LDOCE def in i t ion  forHAMMER, we real ize that the a lgor i thmthat wi l l  assoc iate instruments andpredicates  wi l l  have to take intoaccount, not only the Ving form (in theformula 'for Ving'),  but also itsobject; otherwise a hammer is going tobe thought of as a kind of vehic le :Compa r ea tool ... for driving DRIVE 1 2/3 in LDOCEwitha tool ... for driving DRIVE 1 5/6 in LDOCEnailsA second d i f f i cu l ty  that we must faceup to is that there may be no def in ingNOUN, but an a l l -purpose indef in i tesuch as SOMETHING or ANYTHING.
In thatcase, however,  the INSTRUMENT conceptis l ikely to be expressed somewhereelse in the def in i t ions,  by means of(USED) FOR Ving, for instance.
Thislast point  leads us to an examinat ionof the var ious ways in which the linkbetween instrument and predicate can beconveyed; the existence of a def in ingvocabulary  is a help but the range ofSYNTACTIC poss ib les  remains enormous;however, there is something that couldbe cal led the LEX ICOGRAPHICAL  TRADIT IONand fami l iar i ty  with that t radi t ion canhelp cut down on the number of poss ib leformulae - the fo l lowing stand a goodchance of being rather heavi ly  used :\[~OME THING\] ?..
