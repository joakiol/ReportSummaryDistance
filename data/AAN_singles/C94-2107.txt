'7" , ;LIII'I SO l}}l ' l}l .2 qlanako' is ;i typical giN's li&iil(L679Hanako is the strongest candidate for the backwardcenter of the subordinate clause.
Therefore the hack-ward center of the subordinatc lause is tlanak% armconsequently zero subject qh,,,bj refers to Itanako.By the same way as the subordinate clause caseis dealt with, the zero subject o\[' the main clause4~z,~bj is known to refer to tlanako, too.
This re-sult is neither interpretation a nor b shown above.Another candidate is the property sharing thoery\[Kameyama 88\].
In her theory, since the both ofzero subjects share the snbjecthood, both of themfinally are known to refer to Hanako that is the topicfor both of these clauses.
Therefore the prol)ertysharing theory also fails to account for the iutuitiveinterpretations.Then we shift our attention to more microscopicone, ill which ,roughly speaking, the important partof semantics of complex sentence is tbrmalized as re-lations among semantic roles that appear ill tile mainclause or the subordinate clause.
At the first glance,the constraints about these relations are not local interms of mMn or subordinate clauses, hr other words,semantic roles that appear in subordinate clause andsemantic roles that appear ill the main clause seemto be directly constrained by the constraints of com-plex sentence.
However, looking more carefiflly, wefind that the constraints of subordinate clause andtile cons(fronts of main cla.use are represented as lo-cal constraints by introduciug the new notion of mo-tivated which is characterized as a llerson who haseuollgh reason to act as the lllain clause describes.More precisely, moZivated is one of tire pragmaticroles that appear in a subordinate clause, and theconstraints in subordinate chmse are stated as iden-tity relations between molivaled and other seman-t ic/pragmatic roles appearing ill subordinate clause.Therefore these constraints are local in subordinateclause.
The constraints ill main clause are statedas identity relations hetween molivaled which con|esfrom subordinate clause, and other semantic roles al /pearing in main clause.
Therefore in understandingthe mail( clause we (h)u't have to be care M)out se-mantic/pragmatic roles in subordinate cla.use otherthan a molivaled.
In this sense, the constraints illthe main clause can be treated as almost local con-straints of the main clause.The next question is how to represent tile seman-tics of complex sentence in feature structure( calledlPS henceforth ).
l?or this, we shouhl write downthe constraints about these relations among seman-tic/pragmatic roles ill a feature structure formalism.Due to the space limitation, in this l)aper we ma.inlypursue the constraints about semantic feature struc-tares.2 Hierarchica l  St ructure  ofComplex SentenceWe pay our attention to the general structure of3apanese utterance which is helphfl to rel)resentsemantics of complex sentence.
Several Japaneselinguists have Mready proposed the general struc-tm'e of Japanese utterances \[Mikami 53~ Minami 74,Takuho 87, (~Ullji 89\].
Mikami categorized clausesinto three (:lasses, namely 'open', 'semi-open' and'closed.'
\['his categorization i dicates how freely thecontent of clause interacts with the outside o/' clause.For instance, they arc categorized by the degree ofpossibilities of coreference between zero pronouns in-side the subordinate clause and nominM or topic thatappear in tile main clause.
Following Mikami's idea.,Minami proposed four levels, namely level A, B, Cand D which correspond roughly to VP, proposition,sentence without eommuni(-~tion mood and utter-ance which takes into a.ccount a hearer, respectively.\[Takubo 87\] divided level A into two levels.
One ofthem corresponds to VI', the other corresponds toVP + a certain kind of subject which is called "ob-jective subject."
g~unji proposed the more detailedstructure, in which starting from predicate, say, verband adjective, objects, voice, subject, aspect, tense,modality, topic and mood are or might be sequin>tially added to make all inIbrmatioually more ful-tilled sentence component, l"iually, it; ends up withall utterallce.
\[n GIlIl j i 's strllctlll:e, solne node ('allhave more than two (laughter nodes to make morecoutl)lexsentence.
Following them, tim structure ofthe so called (chlase level) complex sentence is thefollowing shown in Fig.

If a clause with "garu/ga.t-ta"is a subordinate claus(;, the ca'per, cheer cannot beidentified with a semantic role corresponding to the.subject of main clause or higher clause.As for category 2, subjective verbs like "ku-rusimu" (feel sick) and "kanasimu" (feel sadness) thatdescribe subjective and/or emotional experience inverb form, are used.
Like the case of gar'u, anobserver who observers the experience can be ill-troduced.
However this observer is not obligatory.Therefore unlike the "garu/gat--ta" case, the expe-riencer also can be an obligatory senrantic role ofhigher clause as well as the speaker.4 Complex  Sentence4.1 Feature  S t ruc tureAccording to the hierachieal structure of Japanesesentence shown it\] Fig.1 , the essential l)art of hierar-chical structure of the following sentence (5) is sllownin Fig.2 .

'In both of (6) and (7), the m.otivateds of subor-dinate clause are constrained by $2, namely moti-vateds can be either q5~, v or the observe," of subordi-nate clause.
Constraint M1 says that in both cases,qS~.qt is unified with the reel\[rated.
Intuitively in (6),qS~gt is ~b~,.p.
On the other hand in (7), G qt is theobserver.
Both of these interpretations comply withconstraints $2, and M1.\[q51exp atui node \](8) \[ behot because\]q52exp komaru.be in trouble.
'Since it is hot, I am in trouble.
'Intuitively q$1~.,.p corefer with q52<.
:~ v. This inter-pretation is expected by eonstrMnt $3 and M2 thatapply in this case.
As you know from these exainples,our constrMnts are not strong enough to identify theantecedent of qSan, uniquely, lint makes safe inter-pretations.
Moreover disambiguation done by theseconstraints i useflfl for further inference that will bedone with comnionsense knowledge or with a specialvocabulary like 'kekkyokn(finally)' used in (7).In case of $5, namely iritransitive passive or ad-versity passive, it is well known, i.e.
\[Gnnji 87\] thattbere exists a person who is affected by tile situa-tion described by tile passive sentence.
An examplesentence is the following.\[~Jaffect tr irr ia- ni sin -are(9) \[ wife be dead -PASSIVE-ta noni\]-PAST but\]~exp kanasimi - me -st nat.show sadness not,'Although his wife had gone, 05~:,,~> doesn't showa bit of sadness.The semantic role of this a.ffected l)erson , ill (9)zero role:Gqj~t whose wiD was dead, is ~tl'i ajfected.Tile intuitive interl)retation that 6~*'i, = Gd.r~t( =motivated), is expected by our constraints: $5 ofTable.3 and M1 of Table.'\].
On the contrary, lit caseof $6, namely transitive passive, gellera.lly we don'thave an affecled, ltowever in seine context, a transi-tive passive form lnay require the role affeclcd whichis inherent o adversity passive.
For instance,(10) ~a.Uect saihn- ga. iillSUniwallet- SUFI3 steal- a re  - t a-PASSIVE -PAST'd)a.ffect's wallet was sl.olen.
'hi this case, a. person whose wallet was stolen isnot explicit but regarded as an affected.
Anothercase having an affected is that a rela.tional noun isthe subject of trlmsitive passive.
Then a person whois in the relation exl)ressed by the relational aolln isthought to be affected by that situation ,too.
Herewe take 'lnother', 'father', 'daughter', 'son', 'super-visor', and so forth as a relationM noun.
A couple ofexanlple sentences are tbe following.
(12)\[ kobnn -ga yar -are( l l )  \[ henchman -SUB3 attack -PASSIVE-ta node \]-PAST because\]~b<,nt s ikaes i -  n i  it-ta.retaliate go- I)AST'Since his henchman was a.ttacked, the boss re-tMiated.
'\[ kobun -ga yar -are\[ himchman -SUBJ attack -PA.SSIVE-ta noni\] 4b<q~ te-o komaneite-iru.-PAST but \] did nothing.
'Although his henchman was attacked, the bossdidn't retaliate.
'qJ,<.qt who retaliated (1 1) (or didn't retaliate (12))has a certain relation between the henchman who hadbeen attacked.
For instance, q$<</t may be the bossof that henchnian.
In i l l ) ,  since constraint $6 ofTaMe.3 and M1 of Table.4 apply, ?5ant is an affectedofattacking event described in tile suboMina.te clause.This interpretation coincides with native's intuition.In sum, with these constraints, a constraint sat-isfa.ction process in {JO based parsing can be donelocally and consequently very efficiently.
In otherwords, l)rimarily a constraint satisfaction process ofa subordinate clause can be done within the analysisof subordinate clause, and tllat of the main clause canbe done within it except for using motivaled whosevalue has already been constl:ained in the subordi-nate clause.5 Re la ted  Works  and  Conc lu -s ionsOne of the relevant researches to ours is JPSG thathas l)een developed I)y Gunji \[(hirt j i  87, Gunji  89\]and is further studied by tile ICOT working group.Ollr focus is a l/lore praginatics oriented one tha.n,IPSG is.
Many Jatlanose \[inguisl.s have ah'eadydone the enormous al i iount of I)asic observationsaim proposed linguistie IJleories about the plie-liOlrlena, we deal with in this paper \[Mikaini 53,\[(till() 73, \](lllIO 78, Ohye 75, Minaret 74, "\]'akul)o 87,Tera.l\[iura 84, Terali'll lra 9(), Saito 92\].
Of ('.Ollrse Ollrresearch is based on their works and obserwrtions.
Ill\[Ohye 75\], it is said that if garu is used ill a subordi-nate.
cia,nse, the sill)jeer of I;h('.
Inain clause is not theexperiencer of the sut)ordina.te clause.
In \[Saito 92\],she says tllat 1) a cognizcr that (;orresponds to ourobserver is introduced if .qaru is used, and 2) if anobserver is introduced in the sul)ordinate clause, thementally responsible lie*son appearing in tile mainclause is identical with the observer.
In linguisticl)}lenomena, these observations are similar to the684constraint we propose here.
So what is new?
Theanswer is I, hal,: 1) We explicitly stat, e the semanl.icsof complex sentence as the relations amot~g semttnt.icroles.
Namely, sittce we use scmantic/pragmal, ic rolesinstead of grammal.ical roles in constra.ints, our <-on-sl;traints (;311 ~-t(;('.Ollllt for geFo tLllO,l)hoI;iL ill a.

3) We find that l.hc constraixg.s of complexsentences arc, actually local ones.
