Cooperating agentsExperts use recurnng goal-oriented proce-dures, corresponding to the strategiessketched by van Dijk and Kmtsch (1983)These procedures or strategies were opera-t~onahzed into mtelhgent agents of the com-puterized system Agents consist of a scriptthat defines how they deal with tbelr task,they have a general cornmumcauon compo-nent that allows them to exchange messageswith other agents and to access global knowl-edge sources, they may possess private task-oriented knowledge, and they are eqtuppedwith task-onented data wews for input andoutput Control agents (responsible agentsfor a blackboard - see below) are m ad&uonassigned a little scheduler They actlvate thetrsubordinates by  d~rect message passingData exchange between agents takes place v~athe blackboards The agents keep to thecommumcat~on rules Strategies / agents co-operate in concrete tasks such ass dectdmgabout relevance or semng up a target sum-mary statement Agents may use products ofother agents, but since they have hmltedtasks, they have no soplust~cated commum-cataon behavtour such as bargaining or &s-cussingHgure 2 A screenshot f the SlmSurn user interface relevance assessment agents 0adyblrds) arebusy wlule exploraUon (done by bees) and target ext producUon (by spiders) are suspended91s ' B lackboardsAgents need commumcatlon areas, as amedium of cooperation Functionallyspeaking, these are blackboards (Selfndge,1959, Carver & Lesser, 1994, Engelmore &Morgan, 1988) StmSum blackboards arededicated They are used for reception, stor-age of the input text representation, relevanceassessment, target summary construction andso on Central is the document blackboardthat stores and organizes all knowledge ac-qmred from the source document (of fig 2)Since m the case of professional summariz-ing cogmtlve processing is modular, theagents work m task-specific groups using adechcated blackboard For instance, the rele-vance assessment agents use the relevanceblackboard to put the relevance judgementtogether Every blackboard has a controlspecialist It orgamzes the work of the group,sums up what they have acineved, executes.the group opinion and dehvers the result tothe next blackboard -?
Knowledge baseThe SlmSum knowledge base ts a commonknowledge store compnsmg a text represen-tation winch holds all texts in the system andan ontology of the concepts which areneeded to deal with them3 Computer-oriented discourse representa.tionSince summarizing is a text and reformationprocessing task, we have to represent thosesurface text passages and text meamng umtsm the system winch are really worked upon,concentraung on semantic and pragmaticstructures The representation must supportpragmatic text handhng and deal with boll-sUc text structures as well as wtth local rmcro-structures and layout features, because doc-ument structure knowledge ts a core item ofa professional summanzer's competence?

To account for discourse level documentstructures, SlmSum uses text-type specificsuperstructures (Kmtsch & van Duk ,1983) From a practical point of view, su-perstructures consist of semantic ompo-nents which are hnked by discourse rela-tions In SlmSum, these are RST relations(RST Rhetorical Structure Theory -Mann & Thompson, 1987, Hovy, 1993)While the SGML and the propositionalrepresentations are precoded, the dis-course level document structures are re-constructed uring summarizing Thecognitive agents install the respective RSTrelations Only a few of the most neces-sary and most simple RST relations havebeen implemented ELABORATION,RESTATEMENT, PURPOSE, CAUSE/RESULT, EXAMPLEA small parsimonious ontology has beencoded for every document, where the usedconcepts are organized m a small and veryflat hierarchy The ontology is divided intotwo parts according to Penman (1989) Theupper model is domain independent andtherefore used for all texts m the system,whereas the lower model is dommn specific,so that one is modelled for each documentThe agents do some basle lrfferencmg suchas comparing text units with knowledge baseentries and installing relanons from a fixedset between text umts4 Agents'The core of the SlmSum simulation are ob-ject-onented agents As representatives of theempirically found eogn!tive strategies theymanage the reducUon of a large document to "a short summary Agents &ffer m the repre-sentations they work upon Some of them aresensitive for SGML tags, others need thepropositional presentation to run their meth-odsIn the &msum system, 39 agents are mod-elled m great detml They are revolved m thecentral information reduction task of sum-manzmg, eg the relevance agents Readingand wnting strategies are realized carefullyonly m so far as they are specific for profes-sional summanzaUon, otherwise they remainblack box agents About half of the agentsare "real" agents and the rest are "pseudo"-agents For instance, the explore agent Is ablack box agent of understanding It fakestext comprehension by assigning input pas-sages a precoded propositional representa-tion The reorgamze agent is a black boxagent as ?well It Is presumed to impose En-ghsh grammar and spelling which is not aspecific subtask of professional summariz-ing Therefore the agent functions more orless as a placeholderThe agents fall into the following functmnalclasses planmng and control, exploration,relevance assessment, target extconstructton,quahty enhancement, formulation, and gen-eral knowledge processing In addition, thereare rmnor agents uch as readers and writers?
To make the agents more concrete, we dis-cuss m the following two "real" relevanceagents that happen to be good old acqumn-tances of everybody m automatic summanz-mg relevant-texthmt (realizing the indicatorphrase method, see, e g ,  Palce, 1990 andBorko 1968).and relevant-call, which as-sesses the importance of an entlty by measur-ing its distance from the theme (pnncipleused m Jacobs & Rau, 1990, .McKeown,1985, Trabasso & Sperry, 1985) Moreabout agents is found m Endres-Niggemeyeret al(1995) and m Endres-Niggemeyer.
(I 997)93Relevance agents work under the control ofhold, the responsmble agent for the relevanceblackboard, (cf fig 2) Since the skdled re-d.uct~on of document meaning to the mostrelevant items ~s central to professional sum-manzatzon, hold ms m charge of the core ofthe whole summarizing process?
Relevant-texthintThe relevant-texthmt agent mmplements the"mdmcator phrase method" known since theearly days of automatic abstracting It ex-ploits cue phrases by which authors quahfytheir statements, assunung that the quahfica-.tlon apphes to the scope of the indicatorphrase By rots mere presence, a (posmve) re-&cater phrase, expresses the author's empha-sis and suggests the relevance of the state-ment m its scope In addmon, cue phrasesoften explain what the author announces, e ga new fin&ng or the content of the conclu-smon, and ~ts role m the" documentRelevant-texthmt reads the proposltmons onthe meaning panel of the document black-board (see fig 2) To make out relevantpropos~tlons, mtuses a private dlcuonary,where the potential mdmcator predmcates (cf.table 3) are hsted Since the &cuonary en-tries are annotated with mterpretaUons, theagent can draw the attention of other agentsto these proposmons by passing them partsof its pnvate knowledge .
"Relevant-texth~nt recogmzes the mdmcatorpredmcates by simple pattern matclung ascontmmng an.
indicator phrase, matching rotsdmctaonary entry with a proposmon such asproposmon 5 mn table 2 Consequently, theagent annotates proposmon 4 as describingthe project heme and therefore as Importantand puts it together wroth others on the rele-vance blackboard (see fig 2 and table 4)?
Relevant-caURelevant-call recoguizes a text meamng totemas relevant because it hnks it to the documenttheme (see figure 3) The agent needs thethemauc structure and, as a candidate forlinkage to the document opmc, a textproposmon The agent checks whether anopen RST-type hnk of the document themeis able to attach the candidate If so, theproposmon Is regarded as relevant and addedto the document themeTheme-of-document.dommn_lnvestlgate (project, X)domam_parUclpate (studyjhls, X)dommn_esumate (project, X, ram)mteracuon_report (author, X)dommn contmue (researchers, Y, X)Methods-of-researchdommn_select (researchers, X)dommn_obtmn (researchers,results_clear, X ram)Research-backgrounddommn_concentrate (research, X,past)?
