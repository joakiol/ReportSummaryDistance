uni-stuttgart, de1 In t roduct ionOne of the daunting problems in machine trans-lation (MT) is the mapping of tense.
The papersingles out tile problem of translating Germanpresent ense into English.
This problem seemsparticularly instructive as its solution requirescalculation of aspect; as well as determinationof tile temporal location of events with respectto the time of speech.
We present a disam-biguation algorithm which makes use of gramularity calculations to establish the scopal orderof temporal adverbial phrases.
The describedalgorithm has been implemented and is runningin the Verbmobil system.The paper is organized as follows.
In sections 2through 4 we 1)resent he problem and discussthe linguistic factors involved, always keepingan eye on their exploitation for disambiguation.Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to an abstract; de finition of temporal granularity and a discussionof granularity effects on scope resolution.
In sec-tion 7 the actual disambiguation algorithm ispresented, while section 8 describes its perfor-mance on the Verbmobil test data.
A summarycloses the paper.2 Present  or Future?In contrast o English, the German present enseis commonly used to describe both present andfuture happenings.
One task in translation fromGerman to English is therefore tile dismnbigua-tion of German/)resent tense to present ime orfuture time.
(1) present tense ~ future time-+ present ime* This work was fimded by the German Federal Min-istry of Education, Science, Research and Technology(BMBF) in the framework of the Verbmobil Project un-der Grant 01 IV 101 U.

All errors are my own.2.1 Temporal  OrientationA prominent factor involved in the choice be-tween present and future time (Butt, 1995) isthe temporal orientation of tile time adverbialsthat modi\[y the tensed verb.Only a limited set of time adverbials can refer topresent ime.
Indeed, the set is so small that itcan be enumerated.
The adverbials can be fhr-ther subclassified according to other times theymay refer to.?
only present (now, at the moment)?
also past (just, German eben)?
any time (toda35 this week, in the mean-time, tbr two weeks)All other time adverbials are incompatible withpresent ime.
(2) * On 19th November 2000, I sleep late.?
Some adverbials only refer to past time (e.g.~stm'da35 last week, formerIL recentl), twodays ago).
(3) * I will be here yesterday.?
Others can only be used with filturc time(tomorrow, next week, soon, in ?our d~ys).2.2 Verbs Immune to TemporalOrientation EffectsIn some cases tile temporal orientation of adver-bials sounds a false alarm: Even though an ad-verbial requiring non-present syntactically mod-ifies the tensed verb, German present tense istranslated as present (see examples (4) fromthe British National Corpus).
The effect comesabout because semantically the adverbial mod-ifies not the verb's eventuality but one of theverb's objects.712(4) a.
'lbmorrow i am ah'eady 1)lamfing a golftrip with the boss.
(Verbmobi\] (:orlms)b.
And w(" wish trim the very best of lu(:ktomorrow in Birminghmn.
(British National Corpus, l INe)('.
Another storm fl'om SE ... is expectedhere tomorrow.
(BNC)The decisive factor seems to be the verb senseinvolved.
Thus, for disambiguation a. list; of such'"il\[llll\[llte" vet 'b senses  ltlltSt be compiled.
Suchverbs can be modified by adverbials requiring1)r(~sent and adverbials requiring non-1)resent atthe  Sallle time.

A habit is a set of <:ventsof the same type.
In semantic tern:s, a habitarises from quantiti('ation over events.
If theevents extend indefinitely into the past and fi:-ture., the lmbit is conceived as perutancu, t "andsimple aspect is used; if the events occur over~ limited period of time, the habit is conceivedas temporary and progressive aspect is appro-priate.
A frequency adverbial can be used tospeci\[y tit(: (relative) number of occurrences ofthe event.
Ge.ncral .\[acts cml be viewed as a spe-cial type of a habit.

(Verbmobil corpus)3.2 Disambiguat ionState  Present;.
Disambiguation requires def-inition and classification of all relevant verbsenses according to stativity.
When in a first ap-1)roximation only the most fl'equent verb senseof each verb are considered, a list; of stative verbscan be extracted from a corpus.Habi tua l  l?resent.
The presence of a fie-quency adverbial points to a reading of HabitualPresent.

Present events are usu-ally regarded as having duration, so progressiveis the default aspect for dynamic verb senses inthe present.4 Per fec t  o r  Not?In a special case, Germm~ present tense can berendered as English present perfect: In English,perfect is used to describe periods that begin inthe past and lend up to the present; Germanuses a non-perf~ctive t nse in this situation.

An intervalis then a pair of rational nmnbers <s, c), suchthat s < e. The d'uration of an interval is thedistance between start and end of the interval(d~Lr({s, c)) = e - s).
On the interval structurewe define the relations of inclusion (143) andoverlap (14t)).

'~Although natural mmlbers could have been used to(),rational mm~bers are convenient since they allow freechoice of the unit.5.1 Tempora l  nounsA temporal noun denotes a set; of intervals.
Wedefine the granularity of a temporal noun for-mally as a pair of numbers specifying the mini-real and maximal duration of its intervals (e.g.or'an(day) = (1., 1), gT(t,/~.

The following relation is usedto compare granularity values.

Event and statenouns have the disjointness property, if the de-scribed intervals fimctiolmlly depend on one ofthe particil)ants and the pm'ticil)allt is definite.Thus, example (18) is &wiant.

Thus, the for-mula should not quantify over weeks in generalbut over weeks in May: An inclusion restric-tion to the wide-scope adverbial is needed inthe narrow-scope adverbial (Kamp and Reyle,1993).
(24) ~m: May(rr~) A Vw: week(w) A w C rn,~e : visit(e, John, Jane) A e C m A e C_ wSince temporal quantification requires that anarrow-scope iterative adverbial be includedin the wide-scope adverbial, configurations areexcluded where by conceptual knowledge thenarrow-scope adverbial al cannot be included inthe wide-scope adverbial a2.
By theorem (16)this is the case if a,i has coarser granularitythan a2.6.3 Granularity and ScopeWe have now seen two nlotivations for the prin-ciple (25).
(25) If ~,~ has finer granularity than r~2 and rt,2is iteratively quantified, ~,1 camot  havescope over ~t2.Let us now consider the tbllowing t)rinciple:(26) If 7/'1 has finer granulm'ity than 7~,,) and r~,lis iteratiwfly quantified, ~zl cmmot havescope  over  ?~,2.We are not in a position to tbrmally explain theprinciple.
It, holds for at least all nouns withthe disjointness property.
Although in exam-ple (27a) the vq reading would make perfectsense (Jones is always on holiday), it is excluded.In contrast, example (27b) allows this reading(.Jones shuttles between conference sites).
Theprinciple is not restricted to temporal grmmlar-ity: In (27c) the V~ reading is excluded, too.

Every Monday, Jones was here in amonth in which he was on holiday.b.
Every afternoon, Jones gave a talk at aconference.c.
On every page, 1%und something in-teresting in a paper I read.Taken together, the two principles assert thatthe grmmlarity ranking determines the scope or-der.
In the dismnbiguation algorithm presentedin section 7 we are mainly interested in the po-sition of the highest (iterative) quantifier.
So ifevery pair of time adverbials can be comparedin terms of granularity, we have a procedure tocompute this position.
Comparison of granular-ity (1.5) is not defined if the granularity valuesoverlap or m'e equal.
Equal granularity is onlypossible with specific time adverbials.

John came from every Wednesday to ev-ery weekendOther heuristics will have to come into play incase of overlapping ranularity (see section 8 forfurther discussion).6.4 Deictic AdverbialsAnother factor for determining scope order isdeixis.
Some adverbials ~tre connected in theirinterpretation to the time of speedl (now, at themoment, next week, last week).
Since time ofspeech is deictic (it depends on the context ofutterance), hence defilfite, every function on itwill also be definite.
Deictic adverbials alwaysget wide-scope position.Sentences in which deixis conflicts with granu-larity m'e deviant.

Next month, I will be here every year.7 The D isambiguat ion  A lgor i thmIn the implementation, an underspecified se-nlant;ie representation formalism is used to en-code the source analysis and the transfer esultfor the target (the Verbmobil Interface Term(FIT) formalism (Bos el; al., 1998), which isbased on the theory of Underspecified DiscourseRepresentation Structures (Ileyle, 1995)).
Thedisambiguation heuristics of the system com-pletely rely on local context.
The most impor-tant features in local context are source tense,the predicate names of the tensed verb in sourcemid target, and the time adverbials inodifyingthe verb in source and target (Sdfiehlen, 1998).In a first step, the source and target representa-tions are converted into an abstract representa-tion, using the VIT transfer forlnalism (Dornaand Emele, 1996).
All information irrelevantto tense resolution is removed.
Since no full-fledged tense logic is implemented, informationabout temporal reference is discarded as well.Temporal adverbs are decomposed into prepo-sitional phrases (e.g.
.yesterday -+ on a past,716day).
In particular the following featm'es areextracted:(30) a. multiple classification of verb senses?
stative or dynamic (for Englishonly, cf.
section 3.2)?
1)otentially pertbrmative/self-colnmentary or not (for Englishonly, cf.
section 3.2)?

In case theresult excludes present ime, choose fltture;else choose present (cf.

Simple or Progressive Aspect?
(of.
sec-tion 3)(a) If the tensed verb has a stative sense,choose simple (State Present).
(b) If the tensed verb is used in a self-commentary or perfonnatively, choosesimple (Ilxstantaneous Present).
(c) If there is an adverbial ill STA, chooseprogressive (Temporary Habit and Du-rational Present).
(d) If there is a quantificational dverbialor flequency adverb in TA, choose sim-ple (Permmmnt Habit).
(e) Else choose progressive (DurationalPresent).8 Resu l tsWe tested the system on a data base of 13,625pairs of Gernlan VI~I\]q with their English trans-lations, containing 12,036 tensed verbs.
Allthe d~tl;a were in the appointment schedul-ing domain which is investigated in Verbmobil.They wore transliter~ted and syntactically an-notated 1)3; hand.
rlk'anslation was perforined bythe Verbmol)il transfer component (Dorna andEmele, 1996).
2,758 tensed verbs were modifiedby time.
adverbiMs, 1,373 of these verbs weremodified by time adverbials with known granu-larity.The algorithm made the tbllowing choices tbrthese data.

Doxnain-specific nformation could po-tentially improve results.
In the Verbmobil do-main e.g.
several event types do not hal)i)en in717the present but only in the fllture (tra.vc\], meet,eat, ...).1,1 93.6% of the cases a specific wide-scope timeadverbial could be determined with gramflarityconstraints.
In 4.7% of the cases several timeadverbials of equal granularity had wide scope.A good deal of these cases were alignment er-rors with the translations (e.g.
iibel"morgen -the day after tomorrow).
Other cases were dueto the lack of a treatment for coordination (e.g.on Monday aud on Thmwday or ti'om June toAugust).
Some cases were genuine double de-scriptions of days:(31) a.
Is it possible for you tomorrow on thesecond?b.
I would have time on Wednesdw onWednesday the third of May.In 1.7% of the eases the wide-scope adverbialcould not be determined because some a.dver-bials had overlapping ralmlarity values.
Herethe main culprit was the unspecified adverbwhen (see (32a)).
Other cases were due to in-correct preposition attachment (see (321,)).

After a discussion of the factors involved,particular emphasis was placed on an accountof scope resolution among time adverbials.
Ithas been shown that grmmhu'ity calculations goa long way towards the goal of full scope resolu-tioii.
The cross-commotions between granular-ity and scope have been analysed in detail, andsome motivation for these connections has beengiven.One area of future work is to apply the model tolarger corpora and extend it to cover the full setof tenses.
If translations can be aligned with thetraining data, it would be interesting to investi-gate the extent to which the model can be usedto extract (parts of) the pertinent granularityinformation on temporal nouns from the corpus(Schiehlen, 1998).
For example, the occurrenceof a configuration like (33) could be interpretedas evidence tbr NOUN having coarser granular-ity than week.
