DEVELOPING THE COMMENTATOR, A COMPUTER SYSTEM SIMULATINGVERBAL PRODUCTIONNi lan  B i ly ,  Bengt  S igurdDepar tment  o f  L ingu is t i cs ,  Un ivers i ty  o f  Lund,  SwedenThe project "COMMENTATOR" at the department of generall i ngu is t i cs  a t  the  un ivers i ty  o f  Lund i s  in tended to  tes tideas  about  language product ion .
The sys tem implemented  inBASIC on  the  ABC80 micro -computer  generates  a scene  on themon i to r  where  two persons ,  Adam and Eve,  move randomly  arounda gate .
Not on ly  the  present  pos i t ions  of  Adam and Eve areshown on  the  sc reen  but  even  the  pos i t ions  be fore  the  las tJump.
Th is  se t t ing  i s  a l so  used  fo r  e l i c i t ing  comments f romhuman sub jec ts .
The moves are  generated  randomly  but  the  oper -a tor  can  choose  the  length  o f  the  Jumps.
The in i t ia l  p lace -ment  o f  Adam and Eve can  be determined  by the  operator ,  aswe l l  as  the  ins t ruct ions  fo r  the  mach ine  concern ing  the  focuso f  a t tent ion  (Adam or  Eve)  and the  pr imary  goa l  o f  the  ac tors( the  gate  or  the  o ther  ac tor ) .
On the  operator ' s  command thecomputer  p roduces  a set  o f  wr i t ten  comments on the  deve lopmento f  the  scene .
COM~ENTATOR i s  a research  too l ,  and  does  not  useany  ready-made sentences  descr ib ing  fo rseab le  s i tuat ions .The sys tem works as  fo l lows :  From the  pr imary  in fo rmat ion( the  coord inates  of  the  gate  and the  two actors )  some morecomplex  va lues  are  der ived  (d i s tances ,  re la t ions  " to  le f t " ,  " tor ight"  e tc . )
