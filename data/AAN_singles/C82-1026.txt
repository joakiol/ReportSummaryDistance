Academ~ 1982RECOGNITION'OF ABSTRACT OBJECTS - A DECISION THEORYAPPROACH WITHIN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSINGGerhard KnorzFachbereich Informatik,- FG Datenverwaltungssysteme I ITechnische Hochschule DarmstadtKarolinenplatz 5D-6100 DarmstadtW-GermanyThe DAISY/ALIBABA-system developed within the WAl-projectrepresents both a specif ic solution to the automatic indexingproblem and a general framework for problems in the f ie ld  ofnatural language processing, characterized by fuzziness anduncertainty?
The WAI approach to the indexing problem has alreadybeen published \ [3 \ ] ,  \ [5\] .
This paper however presents the under-lying paradigm of recognizing abstract objects.
The basicconcepts are described, including the decision theory approachused for recognit ion.1 THE "WAI" AND THE "AIR" PROJECT 1The DAISY/ALIBABA system \ [1\ ] ,  \ [2 \ ] ,  \ [3 \ ] ,  as developed at the Technical UniversityDarmstadt analyses abstracts and describes them according to the coordinate in-dexing philosophy using a prescribed set of descriptors.
To perform this task, adomain dependent d ict ionary is needed.
Estimating the non-existence of sui tablysized dict ionar ies to be one of the main problems for research and development ofautomatic indexing \ [4 \ ] ,  in 1978 the WAI project started with d ict ionary construc-t ion.
The two completed d ict ionar ies are?
FST, covering the scope of food science and technology 3 and?
PHYS, covering the scopeofPhysics, a part of INIS ( Internat ional  NuclearInformation ?ystem) 4 .
- -Dif ferent procedures for generating dict ionary data were developed and applied.To c lass i fy  them and to unify the created data is one of the main tasks of d ict ion-ary construction (described in detai l  in \ [3 \ ] ,  \ [4 \ ] ) .
This cannot be done withoutexamination of the i r  influence on the qua l i ty  of the result ing indexing.
To performindexing tests,  the development of DAISY and ALIBABA was another important objec-t ive  of WAI.Indexing results are reported in \ [4 \ ] ,  \ [5 \ ] ,  \[6\] which are based on consistency testsonly, using the manual indexing as a standard.
To confirm or to modify these re-sults,  the AIR project is now preparing a ret r ieva l  test on the physics data baseINKA-PHYS of the Fachinformationszentrum FIZ 4 (Energie, Physik, Mathematik; Karls-ruhe) (order of magnitude: I0.000 documents, 200 search requests).
The indexingwi l l  be based upon the new dict ionary PHYS-2 which is to be constructed using about80.000 documents of the INKA-PHYS data base.2 THE BASIC PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE "WAI"/"AIR" APPROACHThe WAI/AIR approach represents both a specif ic solution of  the indexing problem161162 G. KNORZ .and a general framework for  a wide class of problems within natural language pro-cessing and other f ie lds .This paper wil l  only give reference to details of the particular solution publi-shed elsewhere.
The objective of this work is to present the general frameworkderivable from the basic principles underlying the WAI and the AIR project:(I) Knowledge bases are very important for problem solving.
But to presupposeknowledge for an automatic system must notquestionits applicabil ity, causedby non-existent procedures for construction of knowledge bases of an indispens-able size.
The real ist ic appropriate solution is the main aim rather than aperfect one.
(2) Controlling the quality and expenditure of effort of a system must not waituntil i t  is put into practice.
System development has to be guided by a controlderivable from the task to be performed,(3) The algorithms that make the bases of the procedure should not be assumed to beperfect.
Applied to complex tasks, i t  is a fundamental fact that they arebased on simplified models.The principles can be considered to be a guideline for designing applicationoriented systems.
With good reason i t  is claimed that the quality of such a systemcan be determined by evaluation in application environments only (see for example\[7\], \[8\]).
This cannot be done without empirical studies of the user-system inter-action.The paradigm of recognizing abstract objects presented here is an approach tointegrate the evaluation aspect into system development.
I t  is also an approachto problems, for which no perfect solutions exist or seem to be applicable.3 RECOGNITION OF ABSTRACT OBJECTS3.1 THE DEFINITION OF THE RECOGNITION TASKThe basic idea is to use the application environment i tse l f  to get an implicitdescription of the problem.
Whenever talking about a particular applicationenvironment there is no other way then to take a conceptual model M E as a basiswhich determines the adequate concepts (see \[9 \],  or see also \[1015).Here, a conceptual model has to be formulated in this way, that i t  defines(abstract) objects (x ,k) ,  ~EX, k~K.
~ denotes those aspects of an object whichcan be observed d i rec t ly  with regard to the problem, K denotes a set of objectclasses.
A model m E of the appl icat ion environment gives an imp l i c i t  de f in i t ionof the (recognit ion) problem, by forming a continuous stream of abstracts objects.To develop a recognition system (RS) is nothing more than the f inding of a suitablemapping e: x?e(x) that recognizes an actual x to be (x, e(x)).I f  the RS-mEinterface is identical to the system-user interface, then m E may referto the user's judgement directly, to define the co-occurrence of ~ and k.RECOGNITION OF ABSTRACT OBJECTS 163This is also adequate, whenever human cognitive capabilities are to be simulated.We give some examples:?
Information retrieval can be based upon recognition of document-query relation-ships (described in \[6\]).
~ can be represented by (d,f) where d denotes thedocument, f denotes the query, k may be in the most simple case a member ofthe set {is relevant, is not relevant}, refering to the user's judgement??
Expressions, possibly within the scope of a quantifier as well as hypothesesfor inferences, can both be regarded as abstract objects.
Determining thescope of a quantifier or drawing inferences can be based on the recognitionof those objects by simulating human decisions?Two other examples are given - avoiding the simulation approach:?
Complex tasks often require the testing of many hypotheses, which can beregarded as abstract objects, m E may refer to the final results of theprocessing.?
In \[6\] a decision theory approach to optimal retrieval forms a basis for m E ,defining the task of indexing as recognition of document-descriptor elation-ships?3.2 STRUCTURE OF THE RECOGNITION SYSTEMThe structure of the recognition system as presented here makes evident tbat therecognition problem arises essentially at the interface of two models:?
The (external) conceptual model M E defining the recognition problem.?
The (internal) conceptual model M I used to describe the object with respectto the recognition task.M I is part of the recognition system (Figure 1).
I t  structures the object usingthe knowledge base, so that al l  available aspects that may influence the decisionof the RS are included.
In many cases i t  also init iates the recognition process,i .e.
i t  constructs the hypothesis, represented by the object.According to M I a formal description x of ~ is produced.
We do not consider here'the nature of M I, that can be a sophisticated one with a strong theoreticalfoundation as well as a rather simple and heuristic one.
Different models M Imight cause quite different recognition systems for the same task.
The main pointis, that M I leads to an object description instead of a decision.
Another pointis, that both models M E and M I are essentially independent?
This fact causes every164 G, KNORZobjects l l ;l setof .

That means, an 'optimal recognit ion systems' cannot be definedwithout taking the number of cases causing fau l ts  into consideration or - moreprecisely - the s ta t i s t i ca l  properties of the appl icat ion environment representedby m E .
The desision theory approach appropriate to the given s i tuat ion  is descri -bed in \ [5\]  and \ [6\ ]  with respect to the indexing problem.
The approach requires thatevery single decision of RS is c lass i f ied .
This task is for  the most part ant i -cipated by M E , which defines the set of object classes K. K determines the scopeof possible fau l ts .
Those can be weighted independently by a loss function c:(e(x) ,k)  +w.
With the model m E given, a par t i cu la r  recognit ion system wi l l  causean expected value E(w).
The optimal system RS~!tvp i s the  resu l t  of searchingfor thisRsMI E(w).
I t  can be shown that the optimal decision RS~t(x  ) can which minimizesWbe based on the res t r i c ted  probabi l i t ies  p (k lx ) .
The mappings ek(x ) = p(klx)can b(approximated by polynomial functions to be constructed automatical ly using asample of objects (~,k).
This way has been choosen by the ALIBABA system, thatuses polynomial c lass i f ie rs ,  adapted in the mean square sense \[11\] .
The indexingresults in \ [5\]  and \[6\]  demonstrate that - applied to the indexing problem - therecognit ion approach and in par t i cu la r  the method of approximation is adequate forthe problem.4 DISCUSSIONThe approach of recognizing abstract objects is evaluated using the parad ig  nfautomatic indexing.
The model ~,I E refers - for  pract ica l  reasons - not to theRECOGNITION OF ABSTRACT OBJECTS 165retrieval process but to the decisions of human indexers.
I f  a consistency factor(comparing manual and automatic indexing) measures the quality of automatic in-dexing, the set K requires two elements only.
I f  a more sophisticated evaluationis intended, the set K can be increased, according to the kind of faults thatshould be considered.
The classification of faults can for example depend on thedescriptor under consideration.For the model M I used see for example \[5\] and \[12\].We summarize the essentials of the suggested approach (the f i r s t  point refers inparticular to the indexing paradigm).- The recognition problem causes one to regard two independent models: one withrespect to retrieval and one with respect to analysis of abstracts.
This pointof view is important for an approach to optimal indexing \[6 \], but i t  is notself-obvious.
In \[14\] the retrieval oriented approach of Robertson and theindexing oriented approach of Harter \[13\] are brought together.
The result isa one model approach l ike also other approaches in this f ield (for example\ [15\]) .- The internal  model M I is restr icted to the base of the decision to be made.This fact makes i t  very easy to add i t iona l ly  include a lo t  of knowledge andheur ist ic  procedures, that might play a role only for decision making.
Thereis no risc of causing faults  by determining how to compute the decision, usingthis knowledge.Art i f ic ia l  inte l l igence approaches use a correspondant model M Ito determine the decision \[1G\].- The need for  a model m E implies an educational aspect with respect to evaluation.ensures, that the gap between the optimal system RsM~ t and the ideal m E system(equivalent to mE) is.under control .FOOTNOTESWAI means W~rterbuchentwicklung fUr automatisches Indexing (dictionary construc-tion for automatic indexing), \[3\].
