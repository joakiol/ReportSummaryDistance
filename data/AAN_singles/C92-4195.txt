15I)-W-6900 tteidelbergABSTRACTA system for the automatic segmentation ofGerman words into morphs was developed.The main linguistic knowledge sources usedby the system are a word syntax and a morphdictionary.
The syntax is written in theformalism of right linear regular grammarsand comprises approximately 1,400 rules de-scribing the set of those sequences of morphclasses which underlie syntactically wellformed words.
The morph dictionary containsalmost 11,000 morphs.
Each morph is as-signed to up to 6 morph classes.
- Statisticalevaluations with 6000 test words showed thatmore than 99% of the segmented words got acorrect segmentation.1 INTRODUCTIONIBM Scientific Center Heidelberg is develop-ing a large vocabulary speech recognition sys-tem for German (Wothke et al 1989).
Thesystem needs for each word of its referencevocabulary two types of reference patterns:?
prototypal acoustic reference patterns.?
phonetic transcriptions of the main pro-nunciation variants of the word.Up to now the transcriptions were generatedfor each orthographic word of the referencevocabulary by an automatic procedure havingtwo drawbacks which caused a high amountof manual revision for the generated tran-scriptions:?
For each" word only one transcription wasgenerated.
Our speech recognition system,however, needs at least the most signif-icant pronunciation variants of eachword.?
The automatic procedure took into ac-count only the letter context of each letterto determine its transcription, in German,however, the transcription of a letter isvery often also dependent on itsmorphological context .
-  Most of thetranscription errors of the former systemwere a consequence of the fact that thesystem did not have any intbrmationabout tile morph structure of the words.To reduce the manual work necessary to revisethe transcriptions we currently develop a sys-tem with the following new features:1.
An orthographic word is first segmentedinto its morphs.2.
In a second step one or more phonetictranscriptions are produced for each seg-mentation of the word using letter-to-phone rules which can refer to the morphstructure detected in the first step.The following paragraphs will deal with thefirst step.
We will mainly restrict ourselves tothe linguistic knowledge incorporated in ourcurrent morph segmentation system.
Theoverall architecture of the segmentation systemand details of the segmentation algorithm aredescribed in Wothke/Schmidt (1991).A morphological segmentation procedure forGerman has to deal with the following basicfeatures of German morphology:?
Composition.?
Derivation.?
lnflexion.?
Ambiguous morph structure: Some wordscan be segmented in several ways.?
Reduction of consonant riples: If two lexi-cal morphs are concatenated, where thefirst morph ends in a vocalic letter andtwo identical consonantal letters and thesecond morph starts with the same con-sonantal etter and a vocalic letter, thenthe result of  the concatenation does notcontain the consonantal letter three timesbut only twice.
- The inverse process, i.e.trebling of double consonants, has to becarried out, when segmenting such words.Figure 1 shows the architecture of themorphological segmentation system.
The inter-preter for the segmentation has 5 main inputfiles:Ac'I~ DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt'/T 1992 1 2 1 8 PROC.

A file containing the orthographic wordsto be segmented into morphs.The linguistic knowledge in the first el files ex-ists in 2 representations:* An external representation which is cre-ated by the user of  the system and whichis human readable.?
An internal representation which is auto-matically generated by a preprocessorfrom the external representation andwhich is more suitable for tile processinghy the interpreter.Thc intcrprcter loads tile internal represent-ations of the 4 files and scgmcnts orthographicwords according to tile knowledge in tile files.If a word is morphologically ambigm)us, se-veral segmentations arc generated.2 THE LINGUISTICKNOWLEDGEThe main linguistic knowledge sourccs of thcsystem are the morph dictionary, which con-tains information about tile morph class/eseach morph belongs to, and tile word syntax.We developed a classification scheme lbrGerman morphs and a suitable word syntax.The signiticant step to our current version wasthe classification of an extensive Germanmorph list based on about 9,(100 nlorphscompiled by the Institut fi~r deutsche Sprachcm Mannheim (Germany).
We merged thescmorphs with an expcrimcntal list of about2,200 morphs which we used in tile formerversions of our system.
Additionally, we in-creased the resulting list up to ahnost I1,000entries by many loreign morphs.It turned out that for the manual developmentof the syntax the tormalism o(" finite statenetworks is easier to handle than a right linearregular grammar.
So we lirst represented thesyntax with a finite statc network, whichfinally was translated into a tuoctionallyequivalent right linear grammar.Ac'~s DE COLING-92, NAr~qTzs, 23-28 Aot,q" 1992 l 2 1 9 PROC.

We describe the third andfourth scheme, which are of actual interest (cf.table 1).The substructures of the entire transition netdealing with the word classes verb, adjective,noun etc.
will be called verb net, adjective net,noun net etc.
We should stress that these sub-structures are not independent automata withany separate input.
Nevertheless we call themnets; parts of these nets will be calledsubnets.-  Although the word formation ofthe different word classes is not fully distinctand does share some substructures, it was notpossible to design the entire net in such a waythat the nets for these word classes physicallyshare some subnets.
Instead physical copiesof common subnets had to be created for eachoccurrence of such a subnet in each of thenets.
This is since we used a finite state net-work for the representation of the word syn-tax.
This formalism does not allow to activatefrom different points one common subnet andafterwards to return to the appropriate acti-vation point.We will limit the following description to thenets for those word classes with productivityin word formation.VerbsOur Verb Net is responsible for the segmen-tation of finite verbs.
Those of its subnetscontaining stem-labelled arcs refer to differentcombinations of mood, tense, and weaknessvs strongness of the verb stem.
Each of thesecombinations demands specific inflexionalendings.
- Weak stems are tense-invariant,strong stems can vary - according to tense -by vowel gradation (Umlaut or Ablaut).
As aconsequence, the classification of strong verbstems is oriented towards their suitability forcertain tenses.
For example, < = ging> is animperfect ense form of < = geh%en> (engl.to go).
In our morph dictionary the twomorphs <geh> and <ging> are two inde-pendent entries, each with its own tense-oriented classification.
Weak stems areclassified according to prefixation and deriva-tion needs.
We took into account hree groupsOverview of the Extent of the Syntaxes and Classification Systems Developedofderivational suffixes: 1) <-e l>,  <-er>,  2)< -ig>, < -lich >,  and 3) < ~ier>.
In the areaof verb prefixes, one problem solved in ourcurrent version was to avoid the splitting ofparticular prefixes, e.g.
* < + her+ unter-=geh%en> apart of the correct segmenta-tion which is < + herunter =geh%en > (engl.
:to go down).In German, each infinitive can take the roleof a noun, and each participle can do the sameafter being inflected.
As a consequence, thepart of our transition net related to infiniteverbs is integrated into the Noun Net.The set of verb stem classes had to be ex-panded for our current version to implementcomposition restrictions concerning verbstems as parts of  nouns.
For example, we hadto cope with missegmentations such as?
< + Er= find + er = sehon%ung> apart ofthe correct segmentation < + Er= find%er-=schon%ung> (engl.
careful treatment ofinventors).
At least two restrictions exist:Firstly, the verb stem < find> is not allowedbefore a noun (which the word?
< Erschonung> would be, if existing) but,e.g., the originally identically classified verbstem <bind> is, as in < Bindladen> (engl.string).
Secondly, the morph <er> is nosuitable prefix for the verb stem <schon>but, e.g., for the originally identically classifiedverb stem < schein >,  leading to<erscheinen> (engl.
to appear).
Verb-stem-related restrictions like these, which we imple-mented in our system by adding morphclassifications to the existing ones, are onlyrelevant for nouns, in the first case mentionedabove, this is obvious.
The second restrictiondoes not concern finite verbs, because misseg-mentations only occur when the morph < er>is positioned between two stems.
At the be-ginning of a word, the morph <er> can beseen as a prefix without any restrictions.Adl'ectivesThe adjective net consists of three subnets,each representing a possible way of adjectivalderivation in German.I.
Simple adjectives like < schnell> (engl.
:last), <schOn> (engl.
: beautiful) etc.AcrEs DE COLING-92.

NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992These stems can be compared andinflected.
Some stems occur only in acertain degree o\[ comparison like<bess> (stem of engl.
: better), < bcs>(stem ofengl.
: best).
They have obligatorycomparative or superlative sufiixes whilethe corresponding stems of the positivedegree must not be followed by tllese suf-fixes, like e.g.
<gut> (engl.
: good).2.
Adjectives derived from verbs or verbalstems like < +be=gch%bar> (engl.:passable)3.
Adjectives derived from nonns.
Example:< = he ld%en%haft> (engl.
: heroic).As a peculiarity o1" German word formation,a past participle may be compared andintlected like an adjective stem.
l!xampte: Thepast participle of <gcl ingcn> (engl.
: to suc-ceed) has the comparative forms < +ge-= lung%en >,  < + ge = lung%en%er >,< (am) + ge = lung%en%st%en >.
Thesemay be translated as "successful, more suc-cessful, most successful'.Roughly speaking, the concept of the adjectivenet is to allow an adjective stem to be substi-tuted by more complex constructions, like theones described above.
Special subnets are ex-isting for adverbs and tot adjectives with non-German stems.
The latter is needed formarking foreign suffixes like in< =paral l_el> because these suffixes attractthe word accent, which in ( ierman causes avowel to be pronounced long.NounsA very productive feature of German wordformation in thc arca of  nouns is composition:New nouns may be fbrmed by concatenationof  lexical morphs, optionally interspersed withprefixes, suffixes, and infixes.
In our noun net,this feature is modelled by loops over lexicalmorphs which can be left by inflexion modulesto reach a final state and which cross infixmodules (including zero-infix), prefix modules,and (derivational) suffix modules.lnflexional suffixes occurring in compoundnouns between lexical morphs are treated byus the same way as infixes.Noun stems are classilied according to thefeatures umlaut, etymology (German vs notGerman), obligatory affix, inIlexional suflix,and composition eeds.Foreign WordsEach of  the described nets contains subnetsdealing with the l~brmation of foreign wordswhich are involved in German word forma-tion, e.g.
< = mum.
i f  iz%ier%en> (engl.
tomumify), < = Bas is > (engl.
basis),< = l 'ort~ier (Frenctii engl.
porter).Foreign words without connection to Germanword tbrmation and names are not intendedto be segmented by our system.
So an unseg-mented word is not necessarily a system fail-ure but can be a required rejection (el.Table 3).3 EVALUATIONThe experimental morph list used during thedevelopment of versions 1, 2, and 3 of" oursyntax and classilication scheme consisted of2,200 morphs mainly selected from Ortmann(1985).
In the fourth system the morph listwas extended to ahnost 11,00(1 morphs (cfTable 1).
To evaluate the different versions(each consisting of syntax and classificationscheme), two word sets were used each con-raining 3,0(10 words.
The first set consisted ofrank 1 - 1,000, 300,(X) 1 - 301,000, and600,001-601,000 of a ti'equency list sorted indescending order which was created fi~om acorpus containing articles of  a German busi-ness newspaper with about 31,000,(X)0 runningwords.
This set was used for the iterative im-provement of" our system.
1t is called test set.The second set, serving as a control set, con~rained rank 1,001-2,000, 200,001-201,000, and400,001-401,000 of a corpus obtained from acommon newspaper with about 13,200,000running words.
The control set was necessarybecause of the risk that the later versions weredesigned in such a way as to cope only withthose errors which arose when applying theearlier versions to tire test set.Table 2 shows the improvement in coverageinainly achieved by extending the morph list:While - refcrriug to the control set only - thethird system segmented only !/125 of  the inputwords (=47.5%), the lourth system seg-mented 2,492 words (= 83%).
The quality ofthe segmentations of the tburth system is alittle worse.
The reason for this effect is thelarger morph list allowing more nonsenseconcatenations of morphs.
Although we madegrammar and classification system more re-strictive, it would have been too costly tostrive for equal or better segmentation quality.Table 3 gives an overview of the words whichwere not segmented by the fourth system.Many of them are proper names.Acll~.s DE COL1NG-92, NArCrEs, 23-28 AO~r 1992 l 2 2 1 PROC.
