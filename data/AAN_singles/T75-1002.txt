THE REASONER AND THE INFERENCERDON'T TALK MUCH TO EACH OTHERRobert P. AbelsonYale UniversityIn this paper, I wish to point out animportant problem which has largely escapednotice in the field(s) of natural languageprocessing~ Curiously, it is implicit inthe topic title of this session, "Reasoningand Inference"~ The fact that two termswere used in the title instead of oneimplies a meaningful  dist inct ion between twodifferent types of intel l igent processing~The dict ionary definit ions of reasoningand inference are not much help in making asharp distinction, but in actual use inart i f ic ia l  intel l igence work these are twoquite different traditions, each layingclaim to one of the terms~ Reasoning refersto the processing of abstract proposit ionsto reach abstract conclusions~ Reasoning isformal; it is based on the use of logical ormathematical  rules, or special devices in apart icular problem-solving domain~Inferencing, on the other hand, refers tothe processing of concrete facts to reachconcrete conclusions~ It is informal and"common-sensical"  (whatever we quite mean bythat)~ It includes the curren~ vein of workon "frames" (Minsky, 1974; Winograd, 1975)or "scripts" (Schank & Abelson, 1975) or"conceptual overlays" (Rieger, 1975a) inwhich input patterns are matched to bigmemory structures from which furtherexpectat ions are read out~It is conceivable that one of these twoapproaches is "right" and the other "wrong".It is also conceivable that the twoapproaches are really the same, if only wewere smart enough to see how~ Much morelikely, mechanisms of (at least!)
two ratherdifferent general types can coexist withinthe same intel l igent system, each takingover the processing burden in itsappropr iate contexts~The question I want to raise concernsth~ interface between reasonin~ andin~erencing~ I will init ial ly exploreexamples of this interface in the humanmind, and then comment with respect toart i f ic ia l  intel l igence.
My very tentativeconclusions will be that psychologicalreasoning and inference processes arerelat ively insulated from one another; thatthis has unfortunate, or at any ratepecul iar consequences for human thinking;that it is tempting to want to designart i f ic ia l  intel l igence systems wherein thereasoner and the inferencer talk to eachother more, although it is very unclear howbest to do this; thus this problem mayconstitute a major agenda item forart i f ic ia l  intel l igence in the next decade.M~xin~ abstract aD~ concrete informationIn the course of human affairs, thereoften seem to be cases where lip service ispaid to abstract values (say, racialintegration) but behavior is by contrastresponsive to concrete concerns (say, being3.fearful for one's own children).
Aspol it ical  scientist Robert Dahl puts it,"lit is\] a common tendency ... ofmankind ~ to qual i fy universals inappl icat ion while leaving them intact inrhetorics" On the face of it, this contrastappears hypocrit ical~ More charitably,however, it may in some cases represent anatural di f f iculty in applying abstractprinciples to concrete  cases~ Recentexperimental  studies have demonstrated sucha di f f iculty very strikingly.Several studies by Kahneman and Tversky(1973) have dealt with the use of abstract"base rate" information~ Subjects are givena personal background descript ion of anindividual and are asked to rate thel ikel ihood that he chose one or another oftwo careers~ For example:Jack is a 45-year-old man~ He ismarried and-has four children~ He isgeneral ly conservative, careful, andambitious.
He shows no interest inpol it ical  and social issues and spendsmost of his free time on his manyhobbies which include home carpentry,sailing, and mathematical  puzzles.This background biography is written so asto suggest strongly the stereotypicinference that one occupation is much morel ikely than the other (above, engineer).Now suppose that base rate informationis introduced.
Some of the subjects aretold that the given biography was randomlysampled from a populat ion of individualswith a fixed ratio of the two careerchoices, say 70% lawyers and 30% engineers.Rationally, this base rate information oughtto make the more densely representedoccupation more l ikely to be the correctcharacter izat ion of any single individual.Yet it turns out that subjects given baserate information make occupationalpredict ions no different from subjects givenno base rate information or contrary baserate information.
That subjects might notunderstand the meaning of the base rateinformation cannot be the explanation ofthis irrational result.
A separate group ofsubjects given only base rate informationand no biography correctly applies thestatist ical  odds from the populationproportions to the single case.The explanation for this effect seemsto be that the concrete impression from thebiography subject ively wipes out theabstract statist ical information.
It is asthough the inferential  program scanning thebiography as a single case has no way toborrow from or communicate with thereasoning program which scanned the baserate information.
This explanation gainscredence from the further f inding that thebiography doesn't necessari ly have to bestrongly stereotypic to wipe out theinf luence of base-rate information.At ~a recent conference atCarnegie-Mel lon on "Cognition and SocialBehavior", papers by Abelson (1975a),Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1975)and Nisbett, Borgida, Crandall, and Reed(1975) discussed several related phenomena.Nisbett et al gave a number of str ikingexperimental findings, and the fol lowingpowerful anecdotal example:"Suppose you wish to buy a new car andhave deczded that ... you want topurchase ... either a Volvo or a Saab.
As aprudent and sensible buyer, you go toConsumer Reports, which informs you that theconsensus of their experts is that the Volvois mechanical ly superior, and the consensusof the readership is that the Volvo has thebetter repair record.
Armed with thisinformation, you decide to go and strike abargain with the Volvo dealer before theweek is out.
In the interim, however, yougo to a cocktail  party where you announcethis intention to an acquaintance~ Hereacts with disbel ief and alarm: "A Volvo!You've got to be kidding.
My brother- in- lawhad a Volvo.
First, that fancy fuelinjection computer thing went out~ 250bucks.
Next he started having trouble withthe rear end~ Had to replace it.
Then thetransmission and the clutch~ Final ly hesold it in three years for junk~ Thelogical status of this information is thatof the N of several hundred Volvo-owningConsumec Reports readers has been increasedby one, and the mean frequency-of-repairrecord shifted up by an iota on three orfour dimensions~ But anyone who maintainsthat he would reduce the encounter to such anet informational effect is eitherdisingenuous .or lacking in the mostelemental sel f -knowledge~"If we accept this example as indicativeof a general phenomenon, it may seem toimply that people do not use statist icalinformation properly~ However, that's notquite it, because if the protagonist of thestory had not gone to the cocktai l  party, hewould have used the Consumer Report~information (properly) to buy a Volvo~Rather, like the experiment with thebiographies, it appears that there is aninabi l i ty to translate information from onemode to the other~ If you have anabstract ion (a good statist ical  repairrecord) without direct episodes toinstantiate it, and then in another contextyou are given an episode implying but not byitself proving the contrary abstraction, itis not so easy to put these pieces ofinformation together.
You cannotcomfortably add the new episode to theinstance set stored under the oldabstraction; it's the only instance, and itdoesn't support the abstraction.
There isno commensurabi l i ty of information, eitherat a concrete or at an abstract level.
Howwould a cleverly designed art i f ic ialknowledge system cope with such a case?
I donot know.Consider another psychologicalphenomenon involving more reasoning than theabove example, but stil l  pitt ing abstractagainst concrete information.
In the lingoof social psychology's ,,attribution theory"(Jones, et al, 1972), both ,,consensus"information and ,,distinctiveness"information are useful in assigning causalresponsib i l i ty  for an event~ Given astatement about an actor's response to ast imulus ("Mary ran away from the dog"), itis possible to locate the cause eitherpr imari ly  in the actor ("Mary was fearful")or in the stimulus ("The dog wasfr ightening").
From simple reasoning(setting aside compl icat ing factors) itfollows that if the given actor respondsnon-dist inct ively to other similar stimuli("Mary is afraid of other dogs") and thereis non-consensus from other actors towardthis stimulus ("No one else is afraid ofthis dog") then it is something about Marywhich has caused the event.
On the otherhand, if the given actor respondsdist inct ively to other stimuli ("Mary is notafraid of other dogs"), and there isconsensus from other actors toward thisst imulus ("Everyone else is afraid of thisdog"), then it is something about the dogwhich has caused the event~In a formal logical sense, consensusand dist inct iveness information aresymmetric and equivalent~ However, it hasbeen found in quest ionnaires posing eventsand asking for attr ibut ions (McArthur, 1972)that dist inct iveness information (what thisactor does with other stimuli) is morepowerful than consensus information (whatother actors do with this st imulus)~ Infact, consensus information is cur iouslyweak in a number of contexts~Miller, Gillen, Schenker, and Radlove(1973) asked college students to read theprocedure section of the classic Mi lgram(1963) study of obedience, in which subjectswere found wi l l ing to administeroverwhelming doses of electric shock toanother person~ Half the subjects weregiven the actual data of the Mi lgram studyshowing that all subjects administeredsubstantial  shocks and a clear major i tycontinued throughout the experiment, evenbeyond the point of apparent danger to thevict im's life~ The other half of thesubjects were left with the naive--andtypica l - -expectat ion that such behaviorwould be quite rare~ Then all subjects wereasked to rate two individuals, both of whomhad administered maximal shock, on elevenevaluat ively loaded trait dimensions such aswarmth, aggressiveness,  etc~Social psychologists have learned tointerpret the apparent ly vicious behavior ofMi lgram's subjects as being due to thesubtly very powerful s i tuat ional  pressurestoward obedience, pressures with universaleffect transcending personal values~ Ifeverybody does something bad, it is not aslogical to fault the given individual whodoes it as it would be if he were one ofonly a few individuals who did it~Nevertheless, logic does not prevail  in thisjudgment~ The Mil ler et al subjects giventhe true consensus information judge the twoshock-givers in v irtual ly equivalent lywicked terms as do subjects not given thisinformation~ Somehow subjects are not ableto adjust their concretely moral ist icinterpretat ions to take account of the baserate of the behavior in question~ The valueinference is impervious to stat ist ical4.reasoning.It may seem that these examples arespecial  in some way, and that perhaps thereasoner and the inferencer do converse inother contexts.
I want to turn now toanother, rather different context which theart i f ic ia l  intel l igence worker will findsomewhat more familiar, but where the samepuzzle arises.How abstraet ly should a planner plan?One of the vexing issues in art i f ie ialintel l igenee which everyone is aware of butnot eager to discuss, is the lack ofgeneral i ty of problem contents.
There is akind of taeit agreement that it is OK foreveryone to define his own arena or tabletop or eoneeptual eorpus, and do his thingwithin that context without worrying yetabout extrapolation.I can understand the arguments for thispermissive att i tude--the necessity to startsomewhere, the danger of doing nothing byworrying about everything, and so on--yetsomehow it stil l  bothers me.
Thus I notethat Terry Winograd's (1972) tour de foreewith the "blocks world" is applauded for itscleverness, but no one to my knowledge hastried to general ize any of the,mechanisms toother problems.Yet other problems arise which seemsomehow very closely related.
For example,Charniak's (1975) paper at this conferenceraises questions about the "supermarketframe"~ The shopper must get items to thecheckout counter with the sometimeinstrumental i ty of a shopping cart.
Itseems clear that there is an analogy betweenthe planned transport of a grocery item to achecklist counter, enabled by the  priorplacement of that item in a mobile cart, andthe planned transfer of a block to an emptyspot on a table top, enabled by the priorgrasping of that block by a mobile robotarm.
To be sure, there are some dif ferencesin side constraints (Shrdlu's arm can onlyhold one thing at a time, while the cart canhold many), but it is the similar it ies whichinterest us, even at this very.
simpleanalogic level~Is there any way to take advantage ofsuch similar it ies in the design of a moreabstract problem understander?
Yes, in myview.
In a recent paper (Abelson, 1975b), Iattempted to develop a set of intentionprimit ives as bui lding blocks for plans~Each primit ive is an act package causing astate change.
Each state change helpsenable some later action, such that there isa chain or lattice of steps from the init ialstates to the goal state the actor desires.These act primit ives we call"deltacts".
They ~re dist inguished by thestate they change, and are notated by thesymbol ~ preceding a state name.
There arenine deltacts in my system, designed(hopefully) such that they could be appliedto almost any natural world content~ (Someof these deltacts make cameo appearances ina Sehank (1975) paper in this volume,5.embel l ished with his idea of planboxes, andwith a new deltact added~ He and I havebeen.
trying to work out ways to graft thedeltacts into an expanded ConceptualDependency formalism)~ For purposes of thepresent paper, it is not necessary toexplain the entire set of deltacts, butmerely to focus  on a portion of themachinery needed for the robot-arm andshopping basket cases~Consider first the abstract goal (orsubgoal) that an object X be located at acertain place Y.
In our abstract system,the achievement o f  this goal requires thedeltact ~PROX, a change in the proximityrelat ions of an object.
This deltact hasfive arguments: the actor A, the object X,the object's start ing place Z, the finalplace Y, and the means M~ In turn, thisdeltact has a set of enabling states, whichmay have to be achieved by other deltacts.The Abelson (1975b) paper considers thegeneral case where the~PROX may be achievedvia a "carrier system" (say, an airplane)run by agents other than the main actor.
Ifwe ignore this unnecessary compl icat ion(along with one other) here, the enabl ingstates for ~PROX may be listed as follows,where "I" denotes an instrumental device(such as a shopping cart) used for means M~a) PROX(A,Z)--the actor must be at thestart ing point;b) PROX(X,Z)--the object is at the samestarting point;c) HAVE(I ,A)- - the actor must haveinstrumental device;thed) UNIT(X, I ) - - the object must be in a"unit relation" with the instrumentaldevice;e) OKFOR(I ,M)--the device must be in goodcondit ion for the transportat ion means~These enablements are very general~They must be satisf ied no matter what thecontent~ Perhaps the level of general i ty istoo high, so that some of the states such asOKFOR may have a feel ing of kluge about them(as Rieger (1975b) wonders), but this is nota problem for other states such as UNITwhich have rather clean properties.
(Thereare two variants of UNIT: nested ("in", or"on"), and joined ("with").
Various niceaxioms characterize objects in UNITrelation, for example, common fate from~PROX; transit iv ity of nesting, etc~)Concret iz ing these condit ions to thetwo applications:Robot arm moving block: The armmust be at the place where theblock is; the arm must have its"hand" (satisfied by definit ion);the object must be put in unitrelation with the hand; the handmust not be damaged (satisfied bydefinit ion.Shoppgr moving an item: The shoppermust be at the place where the itemis; the shopper must have (say) acart; the item must be put in unitrelation with the cart; the cartmust be all right for whatever itis that carts do (roll)~In placing these two appl ications inparallel under a common abstract rubric, weclearly see their s imilarit ies anddifferences.
The robot problem iss impl i f ied because its hand is always there,undamaged~ To satisfy the remaining twostates enabling the desired ~PROX,  it isnecessary to get the arm to where the blockis (another ~PROX, or in Winograd's terms,MOVE), and to join the arm to the block (a~UNIT  in our terms, or GRASP in theoriginal)~ The supermarket problem is onemore complex because the shopper may nothave a cart, or may have a damaged one~ Ifhe doesn't have one, he must execute a~HAVE, and if it is damaged, he mightexecute a ~OKFOR (fix it) or a ~HAVE ofanother~ Additionally, he must get to wherethe item is (~PROX) and nest the item in thecart (~UNIT)~Each of these prior deltacts has itsown abstract list of enablements~ For a~UNIT,  these include a couple of OKFORswhich for grasping are not so klugey: forthe robot, they map into the condit ions thatthe arm be empty and the block have a cleartop.
For a ~HAVE (which can be achievedeither by taking the object -  or havingsomeone give it to you), the enablementsinclude other PROX and UNIT conditions, etc~With a wel l -designed system of deltacts(which mine probably is not, because ofvarious loopholes), it ought to be possibleto have a planner (or an understander of theplans of others) reason appropr iately at alevel well above the specif ic set of contentbindings of a part icular problem frame orscript~ Apart from the academic theoreticalinterest of such an abstract system, wouldit ever be useful to human or art i f ic ialintel l igence working in a given practicalcontext?Well, suppose something went wrong inthe execution of the usual plans in thecontext~ Suppose, for example, thatShrdlu's hand were damaged so that itcouldn't grasp the smallest blocks--could itever move them?
Or suppose that the shopperabsolutely couldn't find a cart~In these cases, one could imagine theinferencer (say, of the shopper) contact ingthe reasoner for help, "Do something!
Getthrough your such-thats and Use a theorem orsomething~ I'm in trouble here without acart~" And the reasoner might say, "Welllet's see, you ask for an instrumentaldevice such that you can have it and it's OKfor forming unit connections with a numberof these--what did you call them?--groceryitems, in order to move them a shortdistance?
Well, how big and heavy are thesegrocery items, and how soon do you want ananswer?"
And three minutes later the6.reasoner would come back and say, "Sinceit's an emergency, I' l l be more specif icthan I usually like to be~ I recommendsomething flat, with a big surface area,that you already have and that could bepushed or pulled by hand~ Have you gotanything on your person?
""Well, I have this overcoat~""Oh, good~ Yes, use your overcoat to pullthe grocery items along the floor tothe check-out counter~""What?"
(Horrified) "But the overcoat willget f i lthy!
""Sorry~ That's not my department~ That'sa low-level inference~ I thought youwanted high- level  reasonings"An alternat ive fantasy is that thereasoner might be so busy working outabstract puzzles with its abstractmechanisms (say, running through a UNITexercise on the Towers of Hanoi problem)that it wouldn't be interested in troubl ingwith a si l ly appl ied problem~ "Go away anddon't bother me!
I'm thinking about theTowers of Hanoi~ What do I know fromgroceries?l"RepriseThe argument I have stated as a devil 'sadvocate goes back at least to Wi l l iamJames, writ ing in 1890 of the several"worlds" of the mind:"Every object we think of gets at lastreferred to one world or another~I tsett les into our bel ief as acommon-sense object, a scientif icobject, an abstract object, amythological  object, an object ofsomeone's mistaken conception, or amadman's ~ object, and it reaches thiss ta te~of ten  only after being hustledand bandied about amongst otherobjects until  it f inds some which willtolerate its presence and stand inrelat ions to it which nothingcontradicts~ The molecules andether -waves of the scienti f ic world,for example, simply kick the object'swarmth and color out, they refuse tohave any relat ions with them~\[The\ ]world of classic myth takes up thewinged horse ; .~the  world of abstracttruth, the proposit ion that justice iskingly, though no actual king be just~The various worlds themselves,however, appear (as aforesaid) to mostmen's minds in no very def in i te lyconceived relation to each other, andour attention, when it turns to one,is apt to drop the others for the timebeing out of its account~Proposit ions concerning the differentworlds are made from "different pointsof view'; and in this more or lesschaotic state the consciousness ofmost thinkers remains to the end~Each world whilst it is attended t_oo isreal after its own fashion; only thereality lapses with the attention.
"(James, 1950, p~ 293)~Is James right?
If not, wherein?
If so,is that how artificial intelligence--whichpossibly has design options not available tothe human mind--would like to keep it?ReferencesAbelson, R~P~ Script processes in attitudeformation and decision-making~ Presentedat the Eleventh Carnegie Symposium onCognition, Carnegie-Mellon University,April, 1975~ (a)Abelson, R~P~ Concepts for representingmundane reality in plans~ In D~ Bobrowand At Collins (Eds~), Representationand Understanding~ New York: AcademicPress, 1975.
