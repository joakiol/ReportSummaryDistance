TheUNL module of ETAP-3 naturally combines thetwo major al)proaches accepted in machinetranslation: the lransfer-based approach and theinterlingua pl)roach.1.
In t roductory  RenmrksETAP-3 is a multilmrposc NIA ~ environmmltthat was conceived in the 1980s and has beenworked out in the Institute for lnl~mnationTransmission Problems, Russian Academy ofSciences (Apresian et al 1992, l?,oguslavsky1995).
The theoretical foundation of ETAP-3 istile Meaning ?=> Text linguistic theory by Igor'Mel'6uk and the Integral Theory of Language byJurij Apresian.Eq'AP-3 is a non-comlnercial environmentprimarily oriented at linguistic research ratherthan creating a marketable software product.
Themain focus of the research carried ()tit withI';TAP-3 is COlnputational modelling of naturallanguages.
This attitude explains our effort todevelop the models in a way as linguisticallysound as possible.
We strive to incorporate into thesystem much linguistic knowledge irrespective ofwhether this knowledge is essential for better textprocessing (e.g.
machine translation) or not.
Inparticular, we want our parser to produce what wcconsider a correct syntactic representation of timsentence - first of all because we believe that thisinterpretation is a true fact about tile naturallanguage.
We have had inany occasions to set thatin the long run the iheorctical soundness andcompleteness of linguistic knowledge incorporatedin an NIA ) application will pay.All NLP applications in F, TAP-3 are largelybased on an original system of three-wdue logicand use an original formal language of linguisticdescriptions, I~'Oi>&;T.2.

ETAP-3 MT SystemThe most important module of ETAP-3 isthe MT system that serves five language pairs:(1) English-Russian, (2) Russian - English, (3)Russian - Korean.
(4) Russian - French, and (5)Russian - German.By far the most advanced are the first twoof these pairs.
The system disposes of 50,000-strong so-called combinatorial dictionaries ofRussian and English that contain syntactic,derivational, semantic, subcategorization, andcollocational information.
The system relies oncomprehensive grammars of the two languages.For the other language pairs smaller scaleprototypes are available.ETAP-3 is able to present multipletranslations when it encounters an ambiguity itcannot resolve.
By default, the system producesone parse and one translation that it considersthe most probable.
If the user opts for multipletranslation, the system remembers theunresolved ambiguities and provides allmutuany compatible parses and lexical choices.To give one example from the real output: thesentence They made a general remark that .
.
.
.when submitted to the multiple translationoption, yielded two Russian translations thatcorrespond to radically different syntacticstructures and lexical interpretations: (a) Onisdelali obshchee zameehanie, chto... (= Theymade some comn-lon renlark that ...) and (b) Onivynudili generala otmetit; chto... (= They forcedsome general to remark that ...).2.1.2.
Natural Language Interface to SQL TypeDatabasesThis ETAP-3 module translates freelyworded human queries to a database fromRussian or English into SQL expressions.
It canalso produce the reverse generation of a NLquery from an SQL expression.2.1.3.
System of Synonymous ParaphrasingThe module is designed for linguisticexperiments in obtaining nmltiple meaning-retaining paraphrases of Russian and Englishsentences.
The paraphrasing is based on theconcept of lexical functions, one of theimportant innovations of the Meaning ?=> Texttheory.
The following example shows the kindof paraphrases that can be produced by themodule:(1) The director ordered John to write a report -The director gave John an order to write a report- John was ordered by the director to write areport - John received an orcler fonn the directorto write a report.It is a very promising direction of linguisticresearch and developlnent that can be applied in awide range of activities, including languagelearning and acquisition, authoring, and textplanning.
Besides that, lexical functions are usedfor ensuring adequate lexical choice in machinetranslation and in the UNL module.2.1.4.
Syntactic Error Correction ToolThe module operates with Russian texts inwhich it finds a wide range of errors ingrammatical agreement as well as casesubcategorization a d offers the user the correctversion.2.1.5.
Computer-Aided Language Learning ToolThe module is a standalone softwareapplication constructed as a dialogue typecomputer galne intended for advanced students ofRussian, English, and German as foreignlanguages who wish to enrich their vocabulary,especially to master the collocations of thesenatural languages and their periphrastic abilities.The tool relies on the apparatus of lexicallimctions.
It can also be used native speakers of thethree languages interested in increasing theircommand of the vocabulary (such as journalists,school teachers, or politicians).2.1.6.
Tree Bank WorkbenchThis is the module that utilizes the ETAP-3dictionaries, its morphological analyzer and theparser to produce a first-ever syntactically taggedcorpus of Russian texts.
It is a mixed typeapplication that combines automatic parsing withhuman post-editing of tree structure.2.2.
Major FeaturesThe following ate the most important features ofthe whole ETAP-3 environment and its modules:* Rule-Based Approach?
Stratificational Approach?
Transfer Approach?
Syntactic Dependencies?
Lexicalistic Approach?
Multiple Translation?
Maximum Reusabilty of Linguistic Resources84Ill tile current version of ETAP-3, itsmodules that process NL senteuces are strictlyrule-based.
However, ill a series of recentexperiments, tile MT module was supplenlenledby all example-based component of a translationmenlory type and a statistical component hatprovides semiautonmtic extraction of translatiouequivalents t?om bilingual text corpora (seelomdin & Streiter 1999).ETAP-3 shares its stratificational featurewith many other NLP systems.
It is at tile levelof tile normalized, or deep syntactic, structurethat tile transfer flom tile source to tile targetlanguage takes place in MT.ETAP-3 makes use of syntactic dependencytrees for sentence structure representationinstead of constituent, or phrase, structure.Tile ETAP-3 system takes a lexicalisticstand ill tile sense that lexical data areconsidmed as important as gl'ammarinfornlation.
A dictionary entry contains, inaddition to tile lemma name, information onsyntactic and semantic features of tile word, itssubcategorization flame, a default translation,and rules of various types, and wdues of lexicalfunctions for which tile lemma is tile keyword.The word's syntactic t'eatures characterize itsability/nou-ability to participate ill specificsyntactic onstructions.
A word can have severalsyntactic features elected from a total of morethan 200 items.
Semantic features arc needed tocheck tile semantic agreement between thewords ill a sentence.
Tile subeategorizationframe shows the surface marking of tile word'sarguments (in terms of case, prepositions,conjtmctions, etc.).
Rules are an essential part ofthe dictionary entry.
All the rules operating inETAP-3 are distributed betwecn tile granmmrand tile dictionary.
Grammar rules me moregeneral and apply lo large classes of words,whereas tile rules listed or simply referred to inthe dictionary are restricted ill their scope andonly apply to small classes of words or evenindividual words.
This organization of tile rulesensures the self-tuning of tile system to tileprocessing of each particular senteuce.
Inprocessing a sentence, only those dictionaryrules are actiwlted that are explicitly referred toill the dictionary entries of tile words making uptile sentence.
A sample dictionary enlryfl'agment for tile English noun chance illustrateswhat was said above:\[1\] CHANCE1\[21 POR:S\[3\] SYNT:COUNT,PREDTO,PREDTHAT\[4\] DES:'FACT','ABSTRACT'\[5\] D1.1 :OF,'PERSON'\[6\] D2.1 :OF,'FACT'\[7\] D2.2:TO2\[8\] D2.3:THAT1\[9\] SYN 1 :OPPORTUNITY\[10\] MAG N: GOOD 1~FAIR 1~EXCELLENT\[11\] ANTIMAGN: SLIGHT/SLIM/POOR/LITTLE1/SMALL\[12\] OPER1 :HA VE/STAND1\[13\] REAL1-M: TAKE\[14\] ANTIREAL1 -M:MISSl\[15\] INCEPOPER1 :GET\[16\] FINOPER1 :LOSE\[17\] CAUSFUNC1 :GIVE<TOI>/GIVE\[18\] ZONE:R\[19\] TRANS:SHANS/SLUCHAJ\[20\] REG:TRADUCT2.00\[21\] TAKE:X\[22\] LOC:R\[23\] R:COMPOS/MODIF/POSSES\[24\] CHECK\[25\] 1.1 DEP-LEXA(X,Z,PREPOS,BY1)\[26\] N:01\[27\] CHECK\[2811.1 DOM(X,*,R)\[29\] DO\[30\] 1 ZAMRUZ:Z(PO1)\[31\] 2 ZAMRUZ:X(SLUCFtAJNOST')\[32\] N:02\[33\] CHECK\[34\] 2.1 DOM(X,*,*)\[351 DO\[36\] I ZAMRUZ:Z(SLUCHAJNO)\[37\] 2 STERUZ:X\[38\] TRAF:RA-EXPANS.16\[39\] LA:THAT1\[40\] TRAF:RA-EXPANS.22lane \[12\] - part of speech: a noun.Line 113\] - tile list of syntactic features.Lille \[4\] - tile list of senmntic features.Lines \[5\] - \[8\] - tile subcategorization fiame.Lines \[9\] - \[17\] - the list of lexical functions usedto describe restricted lexical co-occurrence.Lille \[18\] - marks the end of the application-independent infomlation and beginning of theinformation used in tile English-Russiantranslation.Lille \[ 19\] - default ranslation into Russian.lanes \[20\] - \[37\] - a rule for translating tile phraset) 3 , chance in different contexts.Lines \[38\] - \[39\] - a reference to the rule whichintroduces a semantically empty conjunction (that:a chance that we obtain a grant) .Line \[40\] - a reference to the rule whichintroduces particle to (a chance to win).852.3.

hnplementationThe ETAP-3 environment has been implementedon a PC under Windows NT 4.0 environment.The environment has a number of auxiliarytools, including a sophisticated lexicographer'stoolkit that allows the developers and the usersto effectively maintain and update the ETAP-3dictionaries.3.
The UNL Interface3.1 Aims and scenarioThe UNL project has a very ambitious goal:to break down or at least to drastically lower thelanguage barrier for the Internet users.
With timeand space limitations already overcome, theInternet community is still separated bylanguage boundaries.
Theoretically, this seemsto be the only major obstacle standing in the wayof international and interpersonalcommunication i  the information society.
Thisis why the problem of the language barrier onthe Interact is perceived as one of the globalproblems of mankind, and a project aiming tosolve this problem has been initiated under theUN auspices - by the Institute of AdvancedStudies of the United Nations University.Started in 1996, the project curremlyembraces 15 universities and researchinstitutions fiom Brazil, China, Egypt, France,Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan,Latvia, Mongolia, Russia, Spain, and Thailand.In the following years more groups are expectedto join, so that in the long run all languages ofthe UN member states will be covered.The idea of the project is as follows.
Aninterlingua has been developed which hassufficient expressive power to representrelevant information conveyed by naturallanguages.
This interlingua entitled UniversalNetworking Language (UNL) has beenproposed by H. Uchida (UNU/IAS).
For eachnatural language, two systems should bedeveloped: a "deconverter" capable oftranslating texts from UNL to this NL, and an"enconverter" which has to convert NL texts86into UNL.
it sholtld be emphasized that theprocedure of producing a UNL text ix notsupposed to be fully autolnatic.
It will be aninteractive process with the labor dividedbetween the COlnputer and a human expert("writer") in UNI+.This paradigm makes UNL radicallydifferent from conventional machine lranslation.Duo to the interactive oncoilversion, the UNLexpression, which serves as inpul for generation,can be nlado as good as Clio wishes.
The UNLwriter will edit the rough result proposed by theOllConvorlor, corfect its errors, eliminate therenlaining ambiguities.

edu/.UNL is a comlmter language intended torepresent infolmation in a way that allows togenerate a text expressing this information in avery large number of nahtral anguages.
A UNLexpression is an oriented hyper-graph thatcorresponds to a NL sentence in the amount ofinformation conveyed.
The arcs of t11o graph areinterpreted as senmntic relations of the typeagent, ob.ject, lime, place, inslrttment, manlier,etc.
The nodes of the graph are special units, theso-called Universal Words (UW) interpreted asconcepts, or groups of UWs.
The nodes can besupplied with attributes which provideadditional information on their use in lhc givensentence, e.g.
@imperative, @generic, @future,@obligation.Each UW is represented as an t~,nglishword that can be optionally supplied withsemantic specifications to restrict its meaning.In most cases, these specifications locate theconcept in the knowledge base.
It is done in thefollowing way: UW A(icl>B) ix interpreted as'A is subsumed under the category B'.
Forexample, the UW coach used without anyrestrictions denotes anything the English coachcan denote, ll' eric wants to be more precise, onecan use restrictions: coach(icl>transl)ort )denotes a bus, coaclz (icl>lmman) denotes atrainer and coach (icl>do) denotes the action oftraining, in a sense, the apparatus of restrictionsallows to represent UWs as disambiguatedl';nglish words.
On ltle other hand, restrictionsallow to denote concepts which are absent inI~;nglish.
For cxmnple, in Russian there is a largegroup of motion words, whose meaningincorporates the idea of the mode of locomotionor tral/sportation: priletel' 'come by flying',prO@,/' 'come by ship', l)ril)olzti 'come bycrawling', l)ril)eJlal ' 'come running', elc.l!nglish has no neutral words to denote theseconcepts.
Still, on the basis of English one canconstrttct lJWs that approximate requiredconcepts, e.g.
conw(met>shil) ) is interpreted as'come and the method o1' coming ix a ship'.IIere is an example of a UNL expressionfor the sentence(2) Howevel, hmgua,q,e dll/ferences are a barrierto the smoot/L/low of in.fomnation in our society.l';ach line is an expression of the kindrehttion(UWl, UW2).

UNL  - Russ ian  deeonvers ion  bymeans  o f  ETAP-3As was shown in Section 1, ETAP-3 is atransfer-based system where the transfer iscarried out at the level of the NormalizedSyntactic Structure (NormSS).
This level is bestsuited for establishing correspondence withUNL, as UNL expressions and NormSS showstriking similarities.
The most important of thelnare as follows:1.
Both UNL expressions and NormSSsoccupy an intermediate position between thesurface and the semantic levels ofrepresentation.
They roughly correspond tothe so-called deep-syntactic level.
At thislevel the meaning of the lexical items is notdecomposed into the primitives, and therelations between the lexical items arelanguage independent;2.
The nodes of both UNL expressions andNormSSs are terminal elements (lexicalitems) and not syntactic ategories;3.
The nodes carry additional characteristics(attributes);4.
The arcs of both structures are non-symmetrical dependencies.At the same time, UNL expressions andNormSSs differ in several important respects:1.
All the nodes of NormSSs are lexical items,while a node of a UNL expression can be a sub-graph;2.
Nodes of a NormSS always correspond to oneword sense, while UWs may either be broader ornarrower than the corresponding English words:2.1. they can cover a meaning area thatcorresponds to several different word senses at atime (see above);2.2. they can correspond to a fi'ee wordcombination (e.g.
computer-based or high-quality);2.3. they can correspond to a word form(e.g.
best which a form of good or well);2.4. they can denote a concept that has nodirect correspondence in English (see above).3.
A NormSS is the simplest of all connectedgraphs - a tree, while a UNL expression is ahyper-graph.
Its arcs may form a loop andconnect sub-graphs;4.
The relations between the nodes in a NormSSare purely syntactic and are not supposed toconvey a meaning of their own, while the UNLrelations denote semantic roles;5.
Attributes of a NormSS mostly correspond togrammatical elements, while UNL attributesoften convey a meaning that is expressed bothin English and in Russian by means of lexicalitems (e.g.
modals);6.
A NormSS contains information on the wordorder, while a UNL expression does not sayanything to this effect.The NormSS of tile sentence (2) looks asfollows:be ,  presentI~' prcdic "",ikhowever difference, pl barrier, i,l~t~lcompos ~ l-comptf low,  deflanvuave / I \attrib ll\]~-Colnp\]~smooth information inprepos~societyFig.
2 modif~ourAs UNL makes use of English lexical labels, itis expedient to bridge the gap between UNL andRussian via English NormSS which actuallyserves as an Intermediate Representation (IR).in this case tile UNL - Russian interface will bethe simplest.
After the English NormSS hasbeen reached, conventional ETAP English-to-Russian machine translation mode of operationcan be used.The UNL-to-Russian module carries out thefollowing three steps:1.
Transfer from UNL to the intermediaterepresentation (IR).882.
Transfer fronl tile IR to tile RussianilOllnalized syntactic structure (NorlriSS-1)@3.
(\]eneration of a P, ussian sentence from theNornlSS-R.Tile archilecture of tile UNL-Russiandeconverter is shown in Fig.
3.It follows fi'om tile previous discussion that theUNL - NormSS interface should solve thefollowing five tasks:1.
An appropriate English lexeme for everyUW should be selected where it is possible;a Russian lexeme will be provided by tileETAP English - Russian transfer dictionary.If no appropriate English word can be foundfor a UW, other means of expression shouldbe found.2.
UNL syntactic relations should betl-anslated, either by means of I~q'APrelations or widl tile help of lexical items.3.
UNL attributes hould be translated, eitherby lneaus of granunatical features or withthe help of lexical items (e.g.
@however -however).4.
UNL graph should be converted in a tree.5.
Word order should be established.The first aild (parlly) the second tasks aresoh, ed by uleaus Of the infornlatiou stored in theUW English and English conlbinalorialdictionaries.
All lhe rest (tasks 2 io 5) is done bythe rules written in the logical-based I~'OP, tZTformalism.Let us give one example lo ilhlstrate thetransformation f UNL relations into NL words.UNL has a tim relation that holds between anevent and its linle.
As is known, lhe choice ofapprol)riaie words to express lhis relation is to alargo oxleni doterilliried by lexical properties oftile word denoting tilne; cf.
oz._It Moll(lay, atmidnight, idAl summe#; rhtri, e~ the it,at; etc.
InETAP-3 all these cases are treated as tile lexicalfunction LOC denoting (tenlporal) locality (onlexical functions see 2.1.3).
Tile values of alllexical fimctions are given in the lexicon in theentries of their arguments ( ee an example in 2.2above).
While processing tile UNL expression,the tim relation is linked to the lexical ftlucliollLOC which allows to l'iud a correct preposition,both in English and in Russian.3.4.

At this point ETAPEnglish-to-Russian nlachine Iranslation facilitycan be switched which carries through tilephases of transfer and Russian generation.
Thisarchitecture allows to obtain English generalionfor relatively cheap, as ETAP has a Russiau-to-English mode of operation as well.
Firstexperiments in this direction have been carriedOtll which proved quite promising.ReferencesAprcsian Ju.D., I.M.B%uslavsky, L.L.Iomdin et al(1992).
