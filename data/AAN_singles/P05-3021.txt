In order to answer thosequestions we need to know the temporal ordering ofevents in a text.
Ideally, we would have a total order-ing of all events in a text.
That is, we want an eventlike marched in ethnic Albanians marched Sundayin downtown Istanbul to be not only temporally re-lated to the nearby time expression Sunday but alsoordered with respect to all other events in the text.We use TimeML (Pustejovsky et al, 2003; Saur??
etal., 2004) as an annotation language for temporalmarkup.
TimeML marks time expressions with theTIMEX3 tag, events with the EVENT tag, and tempo-ral links with the TLINK tag.
In addition, syntacticsubordination of events, which often has temporalimplications, can be annotated with the SLINK tag.A complete manual TimeML annotation is notfeasible due to the complexity of the task and thesheer amount of news text that awaits processing.The TARSQI system can be used stand-aloneor as a means to alleviate the tasks of humanannotators.
Parts of it have been intergrated inTango, a graphical annotation environment for eventordering (Verhagen and Knippen, Forthcoming).The system is set up as a cascade of modulesthat successively add more and more TimeMLannotation to a document.
The input is assumed tobe part-of-speech tagged and chunked.
The overallsystem architecture is laid out in the diagram below.Input DocumentsGUTimeEvitaSlinketGUTenLINKSputLinkTimeML DocumentsIn the following sections we describe the fiveTARSQI modules that add TimeML markup to newstexts.2 GUTimeThe GUTime tagger, developed at Georgetown Uni-versity, extends the capabilities of the TempEx tag-ger (Mani and Wilson, 2000).
TempEx, developed81at MITRE, is aimed at the ACE TIMEX2 standard(timex2.mitre.org) for recognizing the extents andnormalized values of time expressions.
TempExhandles both absolute times (e.g., June 2, 2003) andrelative times (e.g., Thursday) by means of a num-ber of tests on the local context.
Lexical triggers liketoday, yesterday, and tomorrow, when used in a spe-cific sense, as well as words which indicate a posi-tional offset, like next month, last year, this comingThursday are resolved based on computing direc-tion and magnitude with respect to a reference time,which is usually the document publication time.GUTime extends TempEx to handle time ex-pressions based on the TimeML TIMEX3 standard(timeml.org), which allows a functional style of en-coding offsets in time expressions.
For example, lastweek could be represented not only by the time valuebut also by an expression that could be evaluated tocompute the value, namely, that it is the week pre-ceding the week of the document date.
GUTime alsohandles a variety of ACE TIMEX2 expressions notcovered by TempEx, including durations, a varietyof temporal modifiers, and European date formats.GUTime has been benchmarked on training datafrom the Time Expression Recognition and Normal-ization task (timex2.mitre.org/tern.html) at .85, .78,and .82 F-measure for timex2, text, and val fieldsrespectively.3 EVITAEvita (Events in Text Analyzer) is an event recogni-tion tool that performs two main tasks: robust eventidentification and analysis of grammatical features,such as tense and aspect.
Event identification isbased on the notion of event as defined in TimeML.Different strategies are used for identifying eventswithin the categories of verb, noun, and adjective.Event identification of verbs is based on a lexi-cal look-up, accompanied by a minimal contextualparsing, in order to exclude weak stative predicatessuch as be or have.
Identifying events expressed bynouns, on the other hand, involves a disambigua-tion phase in addition to lexical lookup.
Machinelearning techniques are used to determine when anambiguous noun is used with an event sense.
Fi-nally, identifying adjectival events takes the conser-vative approach of tagging as events only those ad-jectives that have been lexically pre-selected fromTimeBank1, whenever they appear as the head of apredicative complement.
For each element identi-fied as denoting an event, a set of linguistic rulesis applied in order to obtain its temporally relevantgrammatical features, like tense and aspect.
Evitarelies on preprocessed input with part-of-speech tagsand chunks.
Current performance of Evita againstTimeBank is .75 precision, .87 recall, and .80 F-measure.
The low precision is mostly due to Evita?sover-generation of generic events, which were notannotated in TimeBank.4 GUTenLINKGeorgetown?s GUTenLINK TLINK tagger useshand-developed syntactic and lexical rules.
It han-dles three different cases at present: (i) the eventis anchored without a signal to a time expressionwithin the same clause, (ii) the event is anchoredwithout a signal to the document date speech timeframe (as in the case of reporting verbs in news,which are often at or offset slightly from the speechtime), and (iii) the event in a main clause is anchoredwith a signal or tense/aspect cue to the event in themain clause of the previous sentence.
In case (iii), afinite state transducer is used to infer the likely tem-poral relation between the events based on TimeMLtense and aspect features of each event.
For ex-ample, a past tense non-stative verb followed by apast perfect non-stative verb, with grammatical as-pect maintained, suggests that the second event pre-cedes the first.GUTenLINK uses default rules for orderingevents; its handling of successive past tense non-stative verbs in case (iii) will not correctly or-der sequences like Max fell.
John pushed him.GUTenLINK is intended as one component in alarger machine-learning based framework for order-ing events.
Another component which will be de-veloped will leverage document-level inference, asin the machine learning approach of (Mani et al,2003), which required annotation of a reference time(Reichenbach, 1947; Kamp and Reyle, 1993) for theevent in each finite clause.1TimeBank is a 200-document news corpus manually anno-tated with TimeML tags.
It contains about 8000 events, 2100time expressions, 5700 TLINKs and 2600 SLINKs.
See (Dayet al, 2003) and www.timeml.org for more details.82An early version of GUTenLINK was scored at.75 precision on 10 documents.
More formal Pre-cision and Recall scoring is underway, but it com-pares favorably with an earlier approach developedat Georgetown.
That approach converted event-event TLINKs from TimeBank 1.0 into feature vec-tors where the TLINK relation type was used as theclass label (some classes were collapsed).
A C5.0decision rule learner trained on that data obtained anaccuracy of .54 F-measure, with the low score beingdue mainly to data sparseness.5 SlinketSlinket (SLINK Events in Text) is an applicationcurrently being developed.
Its purpose is to automat-ically introduce SLINKs, which in TimeML specifysubordinating relations between pairs of events, andclassify them into factive, counterfactive, evidential,negative evidential, and modal, based on the modalforce of the subordinating event.
Slinket requireschunked input with events.SLINKs are introduced by a well-delimited sub-group of verbal and nominal predicates (such as re-gret, say, promise and attempt), and in most casesclearly signaled by the context of subordination.Slinket thus relies on a combination of lexical andsyntactic knowledge.
Lexical information is used topre-select events that may introduce SLINKs.
Pred-icate classes are taken from (Kiparsky and Kiparsky,1970; Karttunen, 1971; Hooper, 1975) and subse-quent elaborations of that work, as well as inducedfrom the TimeBank corpus.
A syntactic moduleis applied in order to properly identify the subor-dinated event, if any.
This module is built as acascade of shallow syntactic tasks such as clauseboundary recognition and subject and object tag-ging.
Such tasks are informed from both linguistic-based knowledge (Papageorgiou, 1997; Leffa, 1998)and corpora-induced rules (Sang and De?je?an, 2001);they are currently being implemented as sequencesof finite-state transducers along the lines of (A?
?t-Mokhtar and Chanod, 1997).
Evaluation results arenot yet available.6 SputLinkSputLink is a temporal closure component that takesknown temporal relations in a text and derives newimplied relations from them, in effect making ex-plicit what was implicit.
A temporal closure compo-nent helps to find those global links that are not nec-essarily derived by other means.
SputLink is basedon James Allen?s interval algebra (1983) and was in-spired by (Setzer, 2001) and (Katz and Arosio, 2001)who both added a closure component to an annota-tion environment.Allen reduces all events and time expressions tointervals and identifies 13 basic relations betweenthe intervals.
The temporal information in a doc-ument is represented as a graph where events andtime expressions form the nodes and temporal re-lations label the edges.
The SputLink algorithm,like Allen?s, is basically a constraint propagation al-gorithm that uses a transitivity table to model thecompositional behavior of all pairs of relations.
Forexample, if A precedes B and B precedes C, thenwe can compose the two relations and infer that Aprecedes C. Allen allowed unlimited disjunctions oftemporal relations on the edges and he acknowl-edged that inconsistency detection is not tractablein his algebra.
One of SputLink?s aims is to ensureconsistency, therefore it uses a restricted version ofAllen?s algebra proposed by (Vilain et al, 1990).
In-consistency detection is tractable in this restricted al-gebra.A SputLink evaluation on TimeBank showed thatSputLink more than quadrupled the amount of tem-poral links in TimeBank, from 4200 to 17500.Moreover, closure adds non-local links that weresystematically missed by the human annotators.
Ex-perimentation also showed that temporal closure al-lows one to structure the annotation task in sucha way that it becomes possible to create a com-plete annotation from local temporal links only.
See(Verhagen, 2004) for more details.7 Conclusion and Future WorkThe TARSQI system generates temporal informa-tion in news texts.
The five modules presented hereare held together by the TimeML annotation lan-guage and add time expressions (GUTime), events(Evita), subordination relations between events(Slinket), local temporal relations between times andevents (GUTenLINK), and global temporal relationsbetween times and events (SputLink).83In the nearby future, we will experiment withmore strategies to extract temporal relations fromtexts.
One avenue is to exploit temporal regularitiesin SLINKs, in effect using the output of Slinket asa means to derive even more TLINKs.
We are alsocompiling more annotated data in order to providemore training data for machine learning approachesto TLINK extraction.
SputLink currently uses onlyqualitative temporal infomation, it will be extendedto use quantitative information, allowing it to reasonover durations.ReferencesSalah A?
