That Is why there As more emphasisIn literature on whet we call ~ propositions than onwhat we call language propositions.Nevertheless t there can be traced In both types of croat-Ave work some similar patterns through which the human mlndfinds and expresses new things, which can be Illustrated byan analysis of the use made ~y the author of the definiteartlcle.- 112  -
