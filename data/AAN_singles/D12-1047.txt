Givena source sentence in the translation task, thismodel directly estimates the probability thata sentence in the target LM training corpusis similar.
Compared with the traditional ap-proaches which utilize the first pass translationhypotheses, cross-lingual data selection mod-el avoids the problem of noisy proliferation.Furthermore, phrase TM based cross-lingualdata selection model is more effective thanthe traditional approaches based on bag-of-words models and word-based TM, becauseit captures contextual information in model-ing the selection of phrase as a whole.
Ex-periments conducted on large-scale data set-s demonstrate that our approach significantlyoutperforms the state-of-the-art approaches onboth LM perplexity and SMT performance.1 IntroductionLanguage model (LM) plays a critical role in sta-tistical machine translation (SMT).
It seems to bea universal truth that LM performance can alwaysbe improved by using more training data (Brants etal., 2007), but only if the training data is reason-ably well-matched with the desired output (Mooreand Lewis, 2010).
It is also obvious that among thelarge training data the topics or domains of discus-sion will change (Eck et al2004), which causes themismatch problems with the translation task.
Forthis reason, most researchers preferred to select sim-ilar training data from the large training corpus in thepast few years (Eck et al2004; Zhao et al2004;Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010; Axelrod etal., 2011).
This would empirically provide more ac-curate lexical probabilities, and thus better match thetranslation task at hand (Axelrod et al2011).Many previous data selection approaches for LMadaptation in SMT depend on the first pass transla-tion hypotheses (Eck et al2004; Zhao et al2004;Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010), they selec-t the sentences which are similar to the translationhypotheses.
These schemes are overall limited bythe quality of the translation hypotheses (Tam et al2007 and 2008), and better initial translation hy-potheses lead to better selected sentences (Zhao etal., 2004).
However, while SMT has achieved agreat deal of development in recent years, the trans-lation hypotheses are still far from perfect (Wei andPal, 2010), which have many noisy data.
The noisytranslation hypotheses mislead data selection pro-cess (Xu et al2001; Tam et al2006 and 2007;Wei and Pal, 2010), and thus take noisy data into theselected training data, which causes noisy prolifera-tion and degrades the performance of adapted LM.Furthermore, traditional approaches for LM adap-tation are based on bag-of-words models and con-sidered to be context independent, despite of theirstate-of-the-art performance, such as TF-IDF (Eck etal., 2004; Zhao et al2004; Hildebrand et al2005;Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007), centroid simi-larity (Masskey and Sethy, 2010), and cross-lingualsimilarity (CLS) (Ananthakrishnan et al2011a).They all perform at the word level, exact only ter-512m matching schemes, and do not take into accountany contextual information when modeling the se-lection by single words in isolation, which degradethe quality of selected sentences.In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to mod-el the data selection based on the source transla-tion task directly and capture the contextual infor-mation for LM adaptation.
To this end, we proposea more principled translation model (TM) basedcross-lingual data selection model for LM adapta-tion, from word models to phrase models.
We as-sume that the data selection should be performedby the cross-lingual model and at the phrase lev-el.
Given a source sentence in the translation task,this model directly estimates the probability beforetranslation that a sentence in the target LM train-ing corpus is similar.
Therefore, it does not requirethe translation task to be pre-translation as in mono-lingual adaptation, and can address the problem ofnoisy proliferation.To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstextensive and empirical study of using phrase T-M based cross-lingual data selection for LM adap-tation.
This model learns the transform probabili-ty of a multi-term phrase in a source sentence giv-en a phrase in the target sentence of LM trainingcorpus.
Compared with bag-of-words models andword-based TM that account for selecting singlewords in isolation, this model performs at the phraselevel and captures some contextual information inmodeling the selection of phrase as a whole, thus itis potentially more effective.
More precise data se-lection can be determined for phrases than for word-s.
In this model, we propose a linear ranking modelframework to further improve the performance, re-ferred to the linear discriminant function (Duda etal., 2001; Collins, 2002; Gao et al2005) in patternclassification and information retrieval (IR), wheredifferent models are incorporated as features, as wewill show in our experiments.Unlike the general TM in SMT, we explore theuse of TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea et al2004)to identify and eliminate unimportant words (e.g.,non-topical words, common words) for corpus pre-processing, and construct TM by important words.This reduces the average number of words in cross-lingual data selection model, thus improving the ef-ficiency.
Moreover, TextRank utilizes the contex-t information of words to assign term weights (Leeet al2008), which makes phrase TM based cross-lingual data selection model play its advantage ofcapturing the contextual information, thus furtherimproving the performance.The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-lows.
Section 2 introduces the related work ofLM adaptation.
Section 3 presents the frameworkof cross-lingual data selection for LM adaptation.Section 4 describes our proposed TM based cross-lingual data selection model: from word models tophrase models.
In section 5 we present large-scaleexperiments and analyses, and followed by conclu-sions and future work in section 6.2 Related WorkTF-IDF and cosine similarity have been widely usedfor LM adaptation (Eck et al2004; Zhao et al2004; Hildebrand et al2005; Kim, 2005; Fosterand Kuhn, 2007).
Masskey and Sethy (2010) se-lected the auxiliary data by computing centroid sim-ilarity score to the centroid of the in-domain data.The main idea of these methods is to select the sen-tences which are similar to the first pass translationhypotheses or in-domain corpus from the large LMtraining corpus, and estimate the bias LM for SMTsystem to improve the translation quality.Tam et al2007 and 2008) proposed a bilingual-LSA model for LM adaptation.
They integratedthe LSA marginal into the target generic LM usingmarginal adaptation which minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the adapted LM and thegeneric LM.
Ananthakrishnan et al2011a) pro-posed CLS to bias the count and probability of cor-responding n-gram through weighting the LM train-ing corpus.
However, these two cross-lingual ap-proaches focus on modify LM itself, which are d-ifferent from data selection method for LM adap-tation.
In our comparable experiments, we applyCLS for the first time to the task of cross-lingualdata selection for LM adaptation.
Due to lack ofsmoothing measure for sparse vector representationin CLS, the similarity computation is not accuratewhich degrades the performance of adapted LM.
Toavoid this, we add smoothing measure like TF-IDF,called CLSs, as we will discuss in the experiments.Snover et al2008) used a word TM based CLIR513system (Xu et al2001) to select a subset of tar-get documents comparable to the source documentfor adapting LM.
Because of the data sparseness inthe document state and it operated at the documentlevel, this model selected large quantities of irrele-vant text, which may degrade the adapted LM (Ecket al2004; Ananthakrishnan et al2011b).
In ourword TM based cross-lingual data selection model,we operate at the sentence level and add the smooth-ing mechanism by integrating with the backgroundword frequency model, and these can significantlyimprove the performance.
Axelrod et al2011)proposed a bilingual cross-entropy difference to se-lect data from parallel corpus for domain adaptationwhich captures the contextual information slightly,and outperformed monolingual cross-entropy differ-ence (Moore and Lewis, 2010), which first shows theadvantage of bilingual data selection.
However, itsperformance depends on the parallel in-domain cor-pus which is usually hard to find, and its applicationis assumed to be limited.3 Cross-Lingual Data Selection forLanguage Model AdaptationOur LM adaptation is an unsupervised similar train-ing data selection guided by TM based cross-lingualdata selection model.
For the source sentences inthe translation task, we estimate a new LM, the biasLM, from the corresponding target LM training sen-tences which are selected as the similar sentences.Since the size of the selected sentences is small, thecorresponding bias LM is specific and more effec-tive, giving high probabilities to those phrases thatoccur in the desired output translations.Following the work of (Zhao et al2004; Snoveret al2008), the generic LM Pg(wi|h) and the biasLM Pb(wi|h) are combined using linear interpola-tion as the adapted LM Pa(wi|h), which is shown toimprove the performance over individual model,Pa(wi|h) = ?Pg(wi|h) + (1?

)Pb(wi|h) (1)where the interpolation factor ?
can be simply esti-mated using the Powell Search algorithm (Press etal., 1992) via cross-validation.Our work focuses on TM based cross-lingual dataselection model, from word model to phrase models,and the quality of this model is crucial to the perfor-mance of adapted LM.4 Translation Model for Cross-LingualData Selection (CLTM)Let Q = q1, .
.
.
,qj be a source sentence in thetranslation task and S = w1, .
.
.
,wi be a sentencein the general target LM training corpus, thus cross-lingual data selection model can be framed proba-bilistically as maximizing the P (S|Q) .
By Bayes?rule,P (S|Q) =P (S)P (Q|S)P (Q)(2)where the prior probability P (S) can be viewed asuniform, and the P (Q) is constant across all sen-tences.
Therefore, selecting a sentence to maximizeP (S|Q) is equivalent to selecting a sentence thatmaximizes P (Q|S).4.1 Word-Based Translation Model forCross-Lingual Data Selection (CLWTM)4.1.1 Cross-Lingual Sentence Selection ModelFollowing the work of (Xu et al2001; Snover et al2008), CLWTM can be described asP (Q|S) =?q?QP (q|S) (3)P (q|S) = ?P (q|Cq)+ (1??
)?w?SP (q|w)P (w|S)(4)where ?
is the interpolation weight empirically setas a constant1, P (q|w) is the word-based TM whichis estimated by IBM Model 1 (Brown et al1993)from the parallel corpus, P (q|Cq) and P (w|S) arethe un-smoothed background and sentence model,respectively, estimated using maximum likelihoodestimation (MLE) asP (q|Cq) =freq(q, Cq)|Cq|(5)P (w|S) =freq(w, S)|S|(6)where Cq refers to the translation task, freq(q, Cq)refers to the number of times q occurs in Cq,freq(w, S) refers to the number of times w occursin S, and |Cq| and |S| are the sizes of the translationtask and the current target sentence, respectively.1As in Xu et al2001), a value of 0.3 was used for ?.5144.1.2 Ranking Candidate SentencesBecause of the data sparseness in the sentence statewhich degrades the model, Equation (6) does notperform well in our data selection experiments.
In-spired by the work of (Berger et al1999) in IR, wemake the following smoothing mechanism:P (q|S) = ?P (q|Cq)+(1??
)?w?SP (q|w)Ps(w|S)(7)Ps(w|S) = ?P (w|Cs) + (1?
?
)P (w|S) (8)P (w|Cs) =freq(w,Cs)|Cs|(9)where P (w|Cs) is the un-smoothed backgroundmodel, estimated using MLE as Equation (5), Csrefers to the LM training corpus and |Cs| refers toits size.
Here, ?
is interpolation weight; notice thatletting ?
= 0 in Equation (8) reduces the model tothe un-smoothed model in Equation (4).4.2 Phrase-Based Translation Model forCross-Lingual Data Selection (CLPTM)4.2.1 Cross-Lingual Sentence Selection ModelThe phrase-based TM (Koehn et al2003; Och andNey, 2004) has shown superior performance com-pared to the word-based TM.
In this paper, thegoal of phrase-based TM is to transfer S into Q.Rather than transferring single words in isolation,the phrase model transfers one sequence of word-s into another sequence of words, thus incorporat-ing contextual information.
Inspired by the workof web search (Gao et al2010) and question re-trieval in community question answer (Q&A) (Zhouet al2011), we assume the following generativeprocess: first the sentence S is broken into K non-empty word sequences w1, .
.
.
,wk, then each istransferred into a new non-empty word sequencesq1, .
.
.
,qk, and finally these phrases are permutat-ed and concatenated to form the sentence Q, whereq and w denote the phrases or consecutive sequenceof words.To formulate this generative process, let U denotethe segmentation of S into K phrases w1, .
.
.
,wk,and let V denote the K phrases q1, .
.
.
,qk, we referto these (wi,qi) pairs as bi-phrases.
Finally, let Mdenote a permutation ofK elements representing thefinal ranking step.Next we place a probability distribution overrewrite pairs.
Let B(S,Q) denote the set of U ,V , M triples that transfer S into Q.
Here we as-sume a uniform probability over segmentations, sothe phrase-based selection probability can be formu-lated asP (Q|S) ??
(U,V,M)?B(S,Q)P (V |S,U) ?
P (M |S,U, V )(10)Then, we use the maximum approximation to thesum:P (Q|S) ?
max(U,V,M)?B(S,Q)P (V |S,U) ?
P (M |S,U, V )(11)Although we have defined a generative model fortransferring S into Q, our goal is to calculate theranking score function over existing Q and S. How-ever, this model can not be used directly for sen-tence ranking becauseQ and S are often of differentlengths, the length of S is almost 1.5 times to that ofQ in our corpus, leaving many words in S unalignedto any word in Q.
This is another key difference be-tween our task and SMT.
As pointed out by the pre-vious work (Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Gao et al2010; Zhou et al2011), sentence-query selectionrequires a distillation of the sentence, while selec-tion of natural language tolerates little being thrownaway.
Thus we restrict our attention to those key sen-tence words that form the distillation of S, do notconsider the unaligned words in S, and assume thatQ is transfered only from the key sentence words.In this paper, the key sentence words are identi-fied via word alignment.
Let A = a1 .
.
.
aJ be the?hidden?
word alignment, which describes a map-ping from a term position j in Q to a word positionaj in S. We assume that the positions of the keysentence words are determined by the Viterbi align-ment A?, which can be obtained using IBM Model 1(Brown et al1993) as follows:A?
= argmaxAP (Q,A|S)= argmaxA{P (J |I)J?j=1P (qj |waj )}=[argmaxajP (qj |waj )]Jj=1(12)515Given A?, when scoring a given Q/S pair, we re-strict our attention to those U , V , M triples that areconsistent with A?, which we denote as B(S,Q, A?
).Here, consistency requires that if two words arealigned in A?, then they must appear in the same bi-phrase (wi,qi).
Once the word alignment is fixed,the final permutation is uniquely determined, so wecan safely discard that factor.
Then Equation (11)can be written asP (Q|S) ?
max(U,V,M)?B(S,Q,A?
)P (V |S,U) (13)For the sole remaining factor P (V |S,U), weassume that a segmented queried question V =q1, .
.
.
,qk is generated from left to right by transfer-ring each phrase w1, .
.
.
,wk independently, as fol-lows:P (V |S,U) =K?k=1P (qk|wk) (14)where P (qk|wk) is a phrase translation probabilitycomputed from the parallel corpus, which can be es-timated in two ways (Koehn et al2003; Och andNey, 2004): relative frequency and lexical weight-ing, and has two format: phrase translation proba-bility and lexical weight probability.In order to find the maximum probability assign-ment P (Q|S) efficiently, we use a dynamic pro-gramming approach, somewhat similar to the mono-tone decoding algorithm described in the work (Och,2002).
We consider quantity aj as the maximalprobability of the most likely sequence of phrasesin S covering the first j words in Q, therefore theprobability can be calculated using the following re-cursion:step (1).
Initialization:?0 = 1 (15)step (2).
Induction:?j =?j?<j,q=qj?+1...qj{?j?P (q|wq)}(16)step (3).
Total:P (Q|S) = ?J (17)4.2.2 Ranking Candidate SentencesHowever, directly using the phrase-based TM, com-puted in Equations (15) to (17), to rank the candi-date sentences does not perform well.
Inspired bythe linear discriminant function (Duda et al2001;Collins, 2002; Gao et al2005) in pattern classifi-cation and IR, we therefore propose a linear rank-ing model framework for cross-lingual data selec-tion model in which different models are incorporat-ed as features.We consider the linear ranking model as follows:Score(Q,S) = ?T ?H(Q,S)=N?n=1?nhn(Q,S) (18)where the model has a set of N features, and eachfeature is an arbitrary function that maps (Q|S) to areal value, i.e., H(Q,S) ?
R. ?n for n = 1 .
.
.
Nis the corresponding parameters of each feature,and we optimize these parameters using the Pow-ell Search algorithm (Press et al1992) via cross-validation.The used features in the linear ranking model areas follows:?
Phrase translation feature (PT):hPT (Q,S,A) = logP (Q|S), where P (Q|S)is computed using Equations (15) to (17), andP (qk|wk) is phrase translation probability.?
Inverted phrase translation feature (IPT):hIPT (S,Q,A) = logP (S|Q), where P (S|Q)is computed using Equations (15) to (17), andP (wk|qk) is inverted phrase translation proba-bility.?
Lexical weight feature (LW): hLW (Q,S,A) =logP (Q|S), where P (Q|S) is computed usingEquations (15) to (17), and P (qk|wk) is lexicalweight probability.?
Inverted lexical weight feature (ILW):hILW (S,Q,A) = logP (S|Q), whereP (S|Q) is computed using Equations (15) to(17), and P (wk|qk) is inverted lexical weightprobability.?
Unaligned word penalty feature (UWP):hUWP (Q,S,A), which is defined as the ratiobetween the number of unaligned terms andthe total number of terms in Q.516?
Word-based translation feature (WT):hWT (Q,S,A) = logP (Q|S), where P (Q|S)is the word-based TM defined by Equations (3)and (7).4.3 Eliminating Unimportant Words (EUW)To improve the efficiency of cross-lingual data se-lection process, we consider the translation task, theLM training corpus and the parallel corpus in ourtask are constructed by the key words or importan-t words, and thus construct TM by the key wordsor important words, which is another key differencebetween our task and SMT.
We identify and elimi-nate unimportant words, somewhat similar to Q&Aretrieval (Lee et al2008; Zhou et al2011).
Thus,the average number of words (the total word numberinQ and S) in cross-lingual sentence selection mod-el would be minimized naturally, and the efficiencyof cross-lingual data selection would be improved.In this paper, we adopt a variant of TextRankalgorithm (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), a graph-based ranking model for key word extraction whichachieves state-of-the-art accuracy.
It identifies andeliminates unimportant words from the corpus, andassumes that a word is unimportant if it holds a rela-tively low significance in the corpus.
Compared withthe traditional approaches, such as TF-IDF, Tex-tRank utilizes the context information of words toassign term weights (Lee et al2008), so it furtherimproves the performance of CLPTM, as we willshow in the experiments.Following the work of (Lee et al2008), the rank-ing algorithm proceeds as follows.
First, all thewords in a given document are added as vertices ina graph.
Then edges are added between words (ver-tices) if the words co-occur in a fixed-sized window.The number of co-occurrences becomes the weightof an edge.
When the graph is constructed, the scoreof each vertex is initialized as 1, and the PageRankbased ranking algorithm is run on the graph itera-tively until convergence.
The TextRank score Rkwi,Dof a word wi in document D at kth iteration is de-fined as follows:Rkwi,D = (1?d)+d???j:(i,j)?Gei,j?
?l:(j,l)?G ej,lRk?1wj ,D(19)where d is a damping factor usually set as a constan-t2, and ei,j is an edge weight between wi and wj .In our experiments, we manually set the propor-tion to be removed as 25%, that is to say, 75% oftotal words in the documents would be remained asthe important words.5 ExperimentsWe measure the utility of our proposed LM adap-tation approach in two ways: (a) comparing refer-ence translations based perplexity of adapted LMswith the generic LM, and (b) comparing SMT per-formance of adapted LMs with the generic LM.5.1 Corpus and TasksWe conduct experiments on two Chinese-to-Englishtranslation tasks: IWSLT-07 (dialogue domain) andNIST-06 (news domain).IWSLT-07.
The bilingual training corpus comesfrom BTEC3 and CJK4 corpus, which contain-s 3.82K sentence pairs with 3.0M/3.1M Chi-nese/English words.
The LM training corpus is fromthe English side of the parallel data (BTEC, CJK,and CWMT20085), which consists of 1.34M sen-tences and 15.2M English words.
The test set isIWSLT-07 test set which consists of 489 sentences,and the development set is IWSLT-05 test set whichconsists of 506 sentences.NIST-06.
The bilingual training corpus comesfrom Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)6, whichconsists of 3.4M sentence pairs with 64M/70M Chi-nese/English words.
The LM training corpus is fromthe English side of the parallel data as well as theEnglish Gigaword corpus7, which consists of 11.3Msentences.
The test set is 2006 NIST MT Evaluationtest set which consists of 1664 sentences, and the de-velopment set is 2005 NIST MT Evaluation test setwhich consists of 1084 sentences.2As in Lee et al2008), a value of 0.85 was used for d.3Basic Traveling Expression Corpus4China-Japan-Korea5The 4th China Workshop on Machine Translation6LDC2002E18, LDC2002T01, LDC2003E07, LD-C2003E14, LDC2003T17, LDC2004T07, LDC2004T08,LDC2005T06, LDC2005T10, LDC2005T34, LDC2006T04,LDC2007T097LDC2007T07517(a)IWSLT-07 (b)NIST-06Figure 1: English reference translations based perplexity of adapted LMs vs. the size of selected training data withdifferent approaches on two development sets.5.2 Perplexity AnalysisWe randomly divide the development set into fivesubsets and conduct 5-fold cross-validation experi-ments.
In each trial, we tune the parameter ?
in E-quation (1) and parameter ?
in Equation (18) withfour of five subsets and then apply it to one re-maining subset.
The experiments reported below arethose averaged over the five trials.We estimate the generic 4-gram LM with the en-tire LM training corpus as the baseline.
Then, we se-lect the top-N sentences which are similar to the de-velopment set, estimate the bias 4-gram LMs (withn-gram cutoffs tuned as above) with these selectedsentences, and interpolate with the generic 4-gramLM as the adapted LMs.
All the LMs are estimatedby the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
Perplexity isa metric of LM performance, and the lower perplexi-ty value indicates the better performance.
Therefore,we estimate the perplexity of adapted LMs accord-ing to English reference translations.Figure 1 shows the perplexity of adapted LMs vs.the size of selected data.
In this paper, we chooseTF-IDF as the foundation of our solution since TF-IDF has gained the state-of-the-art performance forLM adaptation (Eck et al2004; Hildebrand et al2005; Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007).
CLSrefers to the cross-lingual similarity of (Ananthakr-ishnan et al2011a), and CLSs is our proposed im-proved algorithm on CLS with optimization mea-sure like TF-IDF.

CLPTM(l = 4) is our proposed CLPTM witha maximum phrase length of four, and we score thetarget sentences by the highest scoring Q/S pair.The results in Figure 1 indicate that English ref-erence translations based perplexity of adapted LMsdecreases consistently with increase of the size ofselected top-N sentences, and increases consistent-ly after a certain size in all approaches.
Therefore,proper size of similar sentences with the transla-tion task makes the adapted LM perform well, butif too many noisy data are taken into the selectedsentences, the performance becomes worse.
Similarobservations have been done by (Eck et al2004;518Task # Method BLEUIWSLT-071 Baseline 33.602 TF-IDF 34.143 CLS 34.084 CLSs 34.185 CLWTM(?

Furthermore, it is comfortingthat our approaches (CLWTM and CLPTM(l = 4))performs better and are more stable than other ap-proaches.According to the perplexity results in Figure 1,we select the top 8K sentences on IWSLT-07 andtop 16K sentences on NIST-06 which are similar tothe test set for adapting LM, respectively.
Table 1shows English reference translations based perplex-ity of adapted LMs on two test sets.
Our approach-es have significantly reduction in perplexity com-pared with other approaches, and the results indicatethat adapted LMs are significantly better predictorsof the corresponding translation task at hand thanthe generic LM.
We use these adapted LMs for nexttranslation experiments to show the detailed perfor-mance of selected training data for LM adaptation.5.3 Translation ExperimentsWe carry out translation experiments on the test setby hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) SMT (Chiang,2005 and 2007) system to demonstrate the utility ofLM adaptation on improving SMT performance byBLEU score (Papineni et al2002).
The generic LMand adapted LMs are estimated as above in perplexi-ty analysis experiments.
We use minimum error ratetraining (Och, 2003) to tune the feature weights ofHPB for maximum BLEU score on the developmentset with serval groups of different start weights.Table 2 shows the main translation results on twoTask Translation Hypotheses BLEUIWSLT-07First Pass 34.14Second Pass 34.31NIST-06First Pass 29.78Second Pass 29.91Table 3: The impact of noisy data in the translation hy-potheses on the performance of LM adaptation.test sets, and the improvements are statistically sig-nificant at the 95% confidence interval with respectto the baseline.
From the comparison results, we getsome clear trends:(1) Cross-lingual data selection model outper-forms the traditional approaches which utilize thefirst pass translation hypotheses (row 4 vs. row2;row 11 vs. row 9), but the detailed impact of noisydata in the translation hypotheses on data selectionwill be shown in the next section (section 5.4).
(2) CLWTM significantly outperforms CLSs (row6 vs. row 4; row 13 vs. row 11), we suspect thatword-based TM makes more accurate cross-lingualdata selection model than single cross-lingual pro-jection (Ananthakrishnan et al2011a).
(3) Compared with (Snover et al2008), addingthe smoothing mechanism in the sentence state forCLWTM significantly improves the performance(row 6 vs. row 5; row 13 vs. row 12).
(4) Phrase-based TM (CLPTM) significantly out-performs the state-of-the-art approaches based onbag-of-words models and word-based TM (row 7 vs.row 2, row 4, row 5 and row 6; row 14 vs. row 9,row 11, row 12 and row 13).5.4 Impact of Noisy Data in the TranslationHypothesesThe experiment results in Table 2 indicate the sec-ond pass translation hypotheses (row 2 and row 9)made by TF-IDF are better than the first pass trans-lation hypotheses (row 1 and row 8), so we consid-er that these translations have less noisy data.
Thus,they were considered as the new translation hypothe-ses (the second pass) to select the similar sentencesfor LM adaptation by TF-IDF.Table 3 shows the impact of noisy data in thetranslation hypotheses on the performance of adapt-ed LMs.
The observed improvement suggests thatbetter initial translations which have less noisy data519Task Phrase Length BLEUIWSLT-07l = 1 34.33l = 2 34.44l = 3 34.49l = 4 34.49NIST-06l = 1 29.97l = 2 30.07l = 3 30.14l = 4 30.17Table 4: The impact of phrase length in CLPTM on theperformance of LM adaptation, and the maximum phraselength is four.lead to better adapted LMs, and thereby better sec-ond iteration translations.
Therefore, it is advisableto use cross-lingual data selection for LM adaptationin SMT, which can address the problem of noisy pro-liferation.5.5 Impact of Phrase LengthThe results in Table 4 show that longer phrases doyield some visible improvement up to the maximumlength of four.
This may suggest that some proper-ties captured by longer phrases are also captured byother features.
The performances when the phraselength is 1 are better than that of single word-basedTM (row 6 and row 13 in Table 2), this suspec-t that the features in our linear ranking model areuseful.
However, it will be instructive to explore themethods of preserving the improvement generatedby longer phrase when more features are incorporat-ed in the future work.5.6 Impact of Eliminating Unimportant WordsTable 5 shows the results of EUW by TextRank al-gorithm on the performance of CLTM for LM adap-tation.
Initial represents that we do not eliminateunimportant words.
Average number represents theaverage number of words (the total word number inQ and S) in cross-lingual data selection model.
Theaverage number is reduced when unimportant wordsare eliminated, from 19 to 12 on IWSLT-07 and from37 to 24 on NIST-06, respectively.
This makes thecross-lingual data selection process become moreefficient.
In CLWTM, the performance with EUWis basically the same with that of the initial state; butin CLPTM, EUW outperforms the initial state be-cause TextRank algorithm utilizes the context infor-Task MethodAverageBLEUNumber CLWTMCLPTM(l = 4)IWSLT-07Initial 19 34.31 34.47EUW 12 34.30 34.49NIST-06Initial 37 29.91 30.12EUW 24 29.93 30.17Table 5: The impact of eliminating unimportant wordsby TextRank algorithm on the performance of CLTM forLM adaptation.mation of words when assigning term weights, thusmakeing CLPTM play its advantage of capturing thecontextual information.6 Conclusions and Future WorkIn this paper, we propose a novel TM based cross-lingual data selection model for LM adaptation inSMT, from word models to phrase models, and aimsto find the LM training corpus which are similar tothe translation task at hand.
Unlike the general TMin SMT, we explore the use of TextRank algorithmto identify and eliminate unimportant words for cor-pus preprocessing, and construct TM by importan-t words.
Compared with the traditional approach-es which utilize the first pass translation hypothe-ses, cross-lingual data selection avoids the prob-lem of noisy proliferation.
Furthermore, phrase T-M based cross-lingual data selection is more effec-tive than the traditional approaches based on bag-of-words models and word-based TM, because itcaptures contextual information in modeling the s-election of phrase as a whole.
Large-scale exper-iments are conducted on LM perplexity and SMTperformance, and the results demonstrate that ourapproach solves the two aforementioned disadvan-tages and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for LM adaptation.There are some ways in which this research couldbe continued in the future.
First, we will utilize ourapproach to mine large-scale corpora by distributedinfrastructure system, and investigate the use of ourapproach for other domains, such as speech transla-tion system.
Second, the significant improvement ofLM adaptation based on cross-lingual data selectionis exciting, so it will be instructive to explore oth-er knowledge based cross-lingual data selection forLM adaptation, such as latent semantic model.520AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by 863 program in China(No.
