While researchers usually acknowledge the issues withpredefined listings produced by lexicographers, such lexical resources have been a major catalyst towork on annotating words with meaning.
As well as the heavy reliance on manually produced senseinventories, the work on word sense disambiguation has focused on the task of selecting the single bestsense from the predefined inventory for each given token instance.
There is little evidence that thestate-of-the-art level of success is sufficient to benefit applications.
We also have no evidence that thesystems we build are interpreting words in context in the way that humans do.
One direction that hasbeen explored for practical reasons is that of finding a level of granularity where annotators and systemscan do the task with a high level of agreement (Navigli et al, 2007; Hovy et al, 2006).
In this talk I willdiscuss some alternative annotations using synonyms (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), translations (Sinhaet al, 2009) and WordNet senses with graded judgments (Erk et al, to appear) which are not proposedas a panacea to the issue of semantic representation but will allow us to look at word usages in a moregraded fashion and which are arguably better placed to reflect the phenomena we wish to capture thanthe ?winner takes all?
