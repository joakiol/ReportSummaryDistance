Extracting Word Correspondences from Bilingual CorporaBased on Word Co-occurrence InformationHiroyuki Kaji and Toshiko AizonoCentral Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd.1-280, Higashi-koigakubo, Kokubunji-shi, Tokyo 185, Japan{ kaji, aizono }@crl.hitachi.co.jpABSTRACTA new method has been developed for extracting wordcorrespondences from a bilingual corpus.
First, theco-occurrence infi~rmation for each word in bothlanguages is extracted li'om the corpus.
Then, thecorrelations between the co-occurrence f atures of thewords are calculated pairwisely with tile assistance of abasic word bilingual dictionary.
Finally, the pairs ofwords with the highest correlations are outputselectively.
This method is applicable to rather small,unaligned corpora; it can extract correspondencesbetween compound words as well as simple words.
Anexperiment using bilingual patent-specification corporaachieved 28% recall and 76% precision; thisdemonstrates that the method effectively reduces the costof bilingual dictionary augmentation.1 IntroductionBilingual dictionaries are essential componeuts formachine translation systems.
One of the major problemswith bilingual dictionaries is that they are expensive tobuild, since a huge number of terms are used in a varietyof fields.
Cnmputer support is thus needed to reduce thecost of dictionary building.With the growing wdume of text available inelectronic lorm, a number of methods have been proposedtor extracting word correspondences from bilingualcorpora automatically.
These methods can be dividedinto those taking a statistical approach (Gale & Church1991a; Kupiec 1993; Dagan et al 1993; Inoue & Nogaito1993; Fung 1995) and those taking a linguistic approach(Yamamoto & Sakamoto 1993; Kum~mo & Hirakawa1994; Ishimoto & Nagao 1994).
The statistical approachutilizes the occurrence frequencies and locations of wordsin a parallel corpus to calculate the pairwise correlationsbetween the words in the two languages.
The linguisticapproach primarily extracts correspondences betweencompound words by consulting a bilingual dictionary ofsimple words.These proposed methods for extracting wordcorrespondences from bilingual corpora have thefollowing drawbacks.
First, most of theln assume thatthe input corpora m'e aligned sentence by sentence, whichreduces their applicability remarkably.
Although anumber of automatic sentence alignment methods havebeen proposed (Brown et al 1991 ; Gale & Church 1991 b;Kay & Roscheisen 1993; Chen 1993), they are not veryreliable for real noisy bilingual texts.
Second, thestatistical methods usually require a very large corpus astheir input.
However, it is not easy to obtain a very largecorpus.
Third, tile linguistic methods are restricted toextracting correspondences between compound words.We have developed an extraction method that is freefi'om the above drawbacks.
In Sec.
2 we describe thehasic idea of our methud and give an overview.
In Sec.
3we describe the technical details, and in Sec.
4 wedescribe an experiment using patent-specification texts.In Sec.
5 we make a remark on the effectiveness of theproposed method, and discuss directions forimprovement.2 Overv iew of P roposed MethodThe finding underlying our proposed method is asfollows.
In a hilingual corpus, a pair of wordscorresponding to each other generally accompany thesame context, although expressed in the two diflcrentlanguages.
If we calculate the pairwise correlationsbetween the contexts in which the words occur, acorreponding pair of words will show a high correlation.Although one occurrence of a word may not give asuMcient context o chm'acterize the word, accumulatingall the contexts in which the word occurs throughout thetext allows the word to be distinguished from the otherwords in the same language text.Figure 1 shows how two words are associated throughtheir contexts, each expressed in its respective language.We use the set of words co-nccurring with word w, whichwe refer to as the co-occurrence s t of w, to conciselyrepresent ire accumtdated contexts characterizing theword.
To associate two co-occurrence sets whoseelements are words in different languages, we consult abilingual dictionary and extract the possible wordcorrespondences between them.
The point is that even ifthe pair of words to be associated is missing in thebilingual dictionary, their co-occurrence sets can beassociated through the bilingual dictionary.
Of cource,some of the correspondences between the co-occurrencesets may be also missing in the bilingual dictionary.Nevertheless, the co-occurrence sets can be stillassociated, owing to the other correspondences betweenthem that arc contained in the bilingual dictionary.?

2 Method for extracting word correspondences.idea.
While the examples hown here are for Japaneseand English, the method is applicable to any pair oflanguages.
The method is divided into three parts:Japanese text processing, English text processing, andbilingual processing.
The Japanese text processing iscomposed of sentence segmentation, morphologicalanalysis, and co-occurrence data extraction.
It extracts aco-occurrence set for each word from a Japanese text.Likewise, the English text processing extracts aco-occurrence s t for each word from an Engish text.
Thebilingual processing then calculates the pairwisecorrelations between the co-occurrence sets for Japanesewords and those for English words, and selects the pairsof words with the highest correlations.3 Techn ica l  Deta i ls3.1 Extract ion of words from textNatural language texts are composed of two types ofwords: content words and function words.
The target ofextraction can usually be restricted to thecorrespondences between content words, which arecharacterized by both dominance in number andstraightforwardness.
Additionally, the function words areuseless as elements of co-occurrence sets, since they donot indicate specific contexts.
Therefore, we extract onlythe content words from the texts in both languages.The content words are divided into simple words and24compound words.
The tbnner are extracted by dictionarylook up mid morphological analysis.
To extract thelatter, we are describing a set of rules or patterns.
So far,we have only addressed nominal compounds (simple nounphrases), whose patterns arc given below.
Here, N, A,and NP stand for noun, adjective, and simple noun phrase,respectively.
Nq- stands for at string of one or more Ns.?
Japanese nominal comlxmnds: NP := N N+?
English nonfinal compounds: NP := N N+ I A N+The nominal compounds are extracted from themorphological analysis results by pattern matching.Here, an NP included in a larger NP is rejected, since onlyself-contained NPs qualify as nominal compounds.
Oneexception is an English NP starting wilh a noun that isincluded in an NP starting with an adjective, lmcause thecase of an adjective modil'ying a nominal compound isjust as likely as the case of an adjective being a part of ano Illinltl C O m pc ulld,3.2 Ext ract ion  of  co -occur rence  dataDefinitions of 'co-occurrence' include syntacticco-occurrence, co-occurrence in a k-word window,co- .occur rcuce  ill a sentence ,  and  co -occnr fcncc  ill adocumen| .
We use  co - .occur rence  i n a sentence ,  i n wh ich  apair of words occurring within the same sentence isregarded as a co-occurrence.
While co-occurrence in ak-word window may produce better results when asentence in one hulguage corresi)onds to a sequence oflwo or more shorler sentences in tile other language, it isdifficult to determine an appropriate wdue of k becauseword order differs considerably between Japanese andEnglish.The relations between a compound word and itsconstituent words are not, strictly speaking,co-occnrreuce r lations.
Moreover, if we treated them inthe same n lanucr  its co -occur rence  relations, it wouldcause some confosion.
Suppose that compound word w iscomposed of lwo simple words, w' and w".
If we includedboth w' and w" in the co-occurrence set of w,  and viceversa, the differences between the co-occurrence set of wand those of w' and w" woukl decrease.
Therefore, weexclude the constituent words from the co-occurrence setof a compound word and vice versa.As mentioned in Section 2, the co-occurrence sets of aword are accumulated.
This is not a mere union operation,but a union operation accompanied by frequencycounting.
The resultant co-occurrence s t i s expressed asC(w)= {w,/f, \[ i = 1 ,-'-, n },which shows that word w~co-occurs with word w ( times.3.3 Calcu lat ion of  corre lat ions betweenwordsWe define correlation R(jw, ew) between Japanese wordjw and English word ew as follows.R(jw, ew) : I c(jw) Cl C(ew) I /{ I C(iw) I t- I C(ew) I I C(/w) r) C(ew) I 1.Here, C(jw) = {jw,/t~ I i=  1 , ' " ,  m} and C(ew) = {e%/g j  Ij= 1 , ' " ,  n} are the co-occurrence sets of jw and ew,respectively.
C(j'w) f) C(ew)= {(\]w i , ewj)/lkjl i=  1 , ' " ,m; j= 1 , ' " ,  n} is the intersection of C(jw) and C(ew),whose elements ~u'e pairs of a Japanese word and anEnglish word with their frequency.
\] ?
\[ means the sumof frequencies of all elements.Generating intersection C(\]w) f) C(ew)from C(\]w)andC(ew) is not easy because the procedure ofpairingjw~ (c_C(\]w) and eu~ (E ~ C(ew) ) is nondeterministic.
A pair ofwords cannot be determined independently of the otherpossible pairs.
To reduce processing time, we calculateJ C(jw) () C(ew) I approximately, as illustrated in Fig.3.
For example, the English-based approximatecalculation is done as follows.
First, Japaneseco-occurrence set C(jw) is transformed into pseudoco-occurrence set Cl,(jw) by consulting bilingualdictionary D, which is a set ()f pairs of words:Cp(jw) = {ewj/f'jI j = 1 , ' " ,  n},where f'j = Z f~.m ~ CO'w) & (iw,, ew?
~ DThe intersection of pseudo co-occurrence set Cp(jw) andEnglish co-occurrence s t C(ew) is then generated:Cp(iw) (3 C(ew) = {e%/min{f 'j, gi} \] J = 1 , ' " ,  n}.Finally, \] Cp(iw) () C(ew)\] is calculated as theal)proximatc wtlue of I C(jw) rl C(ew) I :I Cp(jw) (~ C(ew) I = )2 min{f'), gj}.JTiffs approximate calculation is likely to result in anoverestimated correlation when there is ambiguity inpairing jw, ((!
C(/w) ) and eu~ (G C(ew) ), as occurs inFig.
3(a).
Figure 3(a) shows that the number of elementsin the intersection exceeds that in the Japaneseco-uccurrence s t. The English-based and Japanese-basedapproximate calculations therefore do not alwayscoincide with each other.
While selecting the minimmnof the two approxinmte wducs is safer, it does notguarantee a precise value.
Since ambiguity in associatingco-occurrence sets does not occur too often, andconsidering the need lbr efficiency, we execute either ofthe two approximate calculations rather than make aprecise calculation.To increase tile reliability of the correlation values, weremove tile use less  words  f rom tile Co-occur rence  setsbefore calculating the correlations.
The useless Japaneseword i s jw such th at { ew I (j'w, ew) c- D} (\] { ew I ewe- TE}=(T u is the input English text), and tile useless Englishword is ew such that {jw I (\]w, ew) ~ D} f\] {jw \[ jw~: Tj} =(Tj is the inpt, t Japanese text).
These words do notcontribute to the word-pair correlations.3.4 Se lec t ion  of  pa i rs  o f  words with h ighcor re la t ionThe absolute values of the correlations are not signif icantbecause they are sensitive to the numbers of words in theco-occurrence s ts, which vary considerably from word toword.
However, their relative values are significant wheneither a Japanese or an English word i s fixed.
We take thestrategy of selecting the mutually best-matched pairshaving no highly probable competitors.

Here, a is a predetermined constant (0 < a<~ 1 ), and D i s the bilingual dictionary.3.5 Feedback of extracted pairs of wordsObviously, the performance of the proposed methoddepends upon the coverage of the bilingual dictionaryover the corpus.
The coverage is the proportion of theword correspondences in the corpus that are alreadycontained in the bilingual dictionary.
Generallyspeaking, the wider the coverage, the more reliable thecorrelation values.
Accordingly, the feedback ofextracted pairs will probably improve performance, venthough some of them are erroneous.
In Fig.
2, thefeedback is represented by dotted line.4 Experiment and ResultsWe implemented our proposed method on a workstationand carried out an experiment using patent-specificationdocuments in Japanese and English and a bilingualdictionary for a machine translation system.
Thedictionary contains approximately 60,000 Japaneseentry words, each having several English translations.The quantitative profile of the sample patent documentsis shown in Table l(a).We executed the word correspondence extractionprogram for each document.
Parameter a in theselection of pairs of words was assumed to be 0.
Thismeans that tile output pairs were limited as much aspossible.
Both results before and after feedback wereobtained to evaluate the effect of feedback.
The extractedpairs of words were divided into two groups: those whichare already contained in the bilingual dictionary andthose which are not yet contained in the bilingualdictionaryJ ) The former are insignificant from thepractical point of view.
However, they are signficant inevaluating the effectiveness of the proposed correlationmeasure because the dictionary information regarding aparticular pair of words does not contribute to thecorrelation between the pak itself.
Accordingly, weevaluated two cases: Case A - the already known pairs ofwords are included - and Case B - the already known pairsof words are excluded.A good way to evaluate word correspondenceextraction methods is to measure their recall andprecision.
These measures are defined as follows.
Therecall is the proportion of all word correspondences in alJWe neglected tile reference numbers peculiar tothe patent docmnents because their correpondencesare Irivial.

Theprecision is the proportion of extracted wordcorrespondences that arc actually correct.
While theprecision is rather easy to calculate, the recall is difficultto calculate because it is a time-consuming task tomanually identify all the word correspondences in thebilingual cortms.
Therefore, instead of calculating therecall according to its de_nit ion, we make a roughestimation using the ratio of the number of correct pairsof words extracted to the number of words in either theJapanese or English text.
We call this the pseudo-recall.The pseudo-recall indicates the lowest limit of the recallsince a word in the Japanese text does not always have astraightforward counterpart in the English text, and viceversa .Tables l(b) and (c) show the pseudo-recall and theprecision in Cases A and B, respectively, lu Case A, thepseudo-recall and precision before feedback were 27.8%Table 2 Examples of extracted wordcorrespondences.Example( S, S ) ( ~Jl!-~, pumping ) ( ij I ~ ~,)~ ,  subsequently )( S, C ) ( i~lhi, liquid level ) ( ~- ,  thin fihn )( C, S ) ( ~f,4~ ~,i~, vaporizer ) ( ~)~f~ l l, connector )( YfV, ~k,,,,~.

In Case B, the pseudo-recall andprecision before feedback were 25.7% and 74.9%27respectively, and those after feedback were 28.0% and75.6%.The experiment confirmed that the proposed methodcan extract not only compound word correspondences butalso simple word correspondences from a small corpus.Examples of word correspondences xtracted from apatent document are shown in Table 2.
The comparisonof results before and after feedback supported theeffectiveness of using feedback.
That is, feedbackincreases recall while preserving precision.
We alsoascertained that repeating the feedback one more time didnot result in significant improvement.5 DiscussionThe experiment shows that the proposed method iseffective in reducing the cost of bilingual dictionaryaugmentation.
Tile recall of the method is not high.Furthermore, it cannot extract more than onecorrespondence for a word.
Still, the method is effectivebecause it can extract from a small corpus.
BilingualdocumenLs hould be handled separately.
Even if acorrespondence pair of words fails to be extracted fromone bilingual document, it may be extracted from anotherbilingual document, where it occurs prevailingly.The following are directions for further improvement.
(1) Refinement of nominal compound extractionprocedure:The simplified procedure described in Sec.
3.1 oftencauses omission (a nominal compound is not extracted)and noise (an inappropriate word string is extracted).These are major causes of errors in word correspondenceextraction; refining the nominal compound extractionprocedure will considerably improve recall and precision.
(2) Use of symbol/numeral correspondences:In the present implementation, the correspondences ofsymbols and numerals are not used in calculating thecorrelation because the bilingual dictionary does notcontain them.
However, they have the potential ofincreasing the reliablilty of the correlation values.
Acharacter-string-matching routine to identify thecorrespondences of symbols/numerals should thus beadded to the correlation calculation module.
(3) Use of the constituent word information of compoundwords:The key idea of our method is to associate apair of wordsthrough their co-occurrence information with theassistance of a bilingual dictionary.
In contrast, that ofthe previous linguistic methods is to associate a pair ofcompound words through their constituent wordinformation with the assistance of a bilingualdictionary.
These two are not incompatible.
Combiningthem would surely increase the recall and precision forcompound word correspondences.6 ConclusionWe have developed anew method for extracting wordcorrespondences from bilingual corpora.
The essence ofthe method is to calculate correlations between wordsbased on their co-occurrence information with theassistance of a basic word bilingual dictionary.
Thismethod is applicable to rather small, unaligned corpora;it can extract correspondences between ot only simplewords but also between compound words.
In anexperiment with patent corpora, 28.0% pseudo-recall and75.6% precision were achieved.Acknowledgments :  We would like to thank Dr.Michiharu Nakamura, Dr. Testuo Yokoyama and Dr.Hiromichi Fujisawa for their constant support andencouragement.ReferencesBrown, P. F., et a1.1991.
