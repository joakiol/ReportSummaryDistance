This paper will describe the design of the UCGformalism, illustrated by exarnples of grammatical categories andrules, lUCG embodies eve.d recent trends in linguistics.
First, being acategorial grar,amar, it is strongly lexicalist, In other words rela-tively little Jr, formation is contained in grammar rules.
Mostinformation odginates in the lexicon.
Second, it is strictlydechtrative.
Unitication is the only operation allowed over gram-matical objects;.
Third, there is a very close relationship betweenthe syntax and semantics of linguistic expressions.UCG lies with:ht the family of grammars described by Uszkoreit1986 and Kmttunen 1986. tJCG also has close affinities to theIIead-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (I-IPSG) proposed byPollard 1985.
The main theoretical difference is that in IIPSGwelMi~rmedrmss i  characterized algorithmically, rather thandeclm'atively as in OC(/.
For this reason, we t,ave adoptedl'ollard's tenn;nology and refer to linguistic expressions as signs.A sign retm>;ents a complex of phonological, syntactic andsemantic tale.nation, each of these linguistic levels having itsown definitions of well--formedness,In U(.
'G, we employ three primitive categories: nomts (tmun), sen-tences (sent) md noun phrases (ltp) These primitive categoriesi 'IIm work described here is SUl)portexl by the EEC ESPRIT projecP393 ACORD: the Cons|ruction and Interrogation f Knowledge Bases asiaNatural L~mguag(~ Text and Graphics.admit further specification by features, so that we can distinguishtinite and non-finite sentences, nominative and accusative NPs,and so on.
Categories are now defined as follows:(1) a.Any primitive category (together with a syntactic featurespecification) is a category.b.If A is a category, and B is a sign, then A/B is a category.In a Category of the trmr A/B, we call B the active part of thecategory, and also of the sign as a whole in which A/B occurs ascategory.
It will be observed that this definition is just tirecategorial analog of Pollard's (1985) proposal for subcategoriza-tion, according to which phrasal heads ate spccificd for a list ofsigns corresponding to their complements.
Likewise, (1) isclosely related to the standard efinition for the set of categoriesof a categorial grammar,Within the grammar, we allow not just constant sylnbols likesent and rip, but also variables, at each level of representatiou.V~wiables allow us to capture tire notion of inconlplete infomaa-tion, and a sign which contains variables can be further specitiedby unilication.
The form of unification that we rely on is first-order term unification, provided as a basic operation in program-ruing languages uch as PROLOG.This, in essence, is the structure of UCG.
We will complicate thepicture by distinguishing two rules of fnnctional application, andby giving more content o the notions of semantics and features.2.
The Mechanisms of UCt;2.1.
Structuring SignsUCG signs have three basic components, corresponding to their"phonology, category and semantics.
We will write the mostunspecified sign as follows:(2) w:c:sby which we intend a sign with phonology W, categow C andsemantics S. (1) and (2) give well-formedness conditions on pos-sible instantiations for a sign's category.
For the present papm',we will assume that a sign's phonology may be simply itsorthography in tire case of proper names, otherwise a sign's pho-nology may be composite, consistiug of variables and ortho-graphic constants ep~ated by +.
The + operator is understoodas denoting concatenation.
22 This operation might apt)ear to take us beyond tile bounds of first-o~ler unification.
However in the cases we will deal with, there areequivalent signs which express concatenation bymeans of PROI.OG differencelists.832.2.
Indexed LanguageThe semantic representation language that we use to encode thesemantics of a sign is called InL (for Indexed Language), and isderived from Discourse Representation Theory (cf.
Kamp 1981),supplemented with a Davidsonian treatment of verb semantics(cf.
Davidson 1967).
The main similarity with the DiscourseRepresentation languages lies in tile algebraic structure of InL.There are only two connectives for building complex formulas;an implication that at the same time introduces universalquantification, and a conjunction.The language InL differs in one important respect from the DRTformalism, and thus earns its name; every formula introduces adesignated variable called its index.
This does not mean that(sub)formulas may not introduce other variables, only that theindex has a special status.
The postulation of indices is crucialfor the treatment of modifying expressions, but it is indepen-dently plausible on other grounds.
Every sign has an associatedontological type, represented by the sort of its index.
Subsump-tion relations hold between certain sorts; for instance, a index ofsort singular will unify with an index of sort object to yield anindex of sort singular.
For notational purposes, we use lowercase alphabetics to represent sorted variables in InL formulas.Upper case alphabetics are variables over formttlas.
The index ofan expression appears within square brackets in prenex position.
(3) gives example translations of some expxessions.
(3) \[Index\] Formula  Expression Sorta.
\[el WALK(e, x) walk eventb.
Ix\] STUDENT(x) student singular objectc.
\[x\] \[PARK(y),\[x\] \[IN(x,y),MAN(x)\[Iman in a park singular objectd.
\[m\] BUTlER(m) butter mass objecte.
\[s\] STAY(s, x) stay state3.
UCG Binary RulesWe may write UCG rules as simple relations between signs.
Werequire two rules, our analogs of forwards and backwards appli-cation (FA and BA respectively).
Here we follow the PROLOGconvention that variables rart with an upper case alphabetic.
(4) (FA) Phonology:Category/Active:Semantics ActivePhonology:Category: Semantics(BA) Active Phonology:Category/Active:Semantics$Phonology:Category: SemanticsTheSe rules state that in the case of function application, theresulting category is simply that of the functor with its activesign removed; the semantics and phonology of the result arethose of the functor, thus effecting a very strict kind of HeadFeature Convention.
Note in particular that we view the phono-logical, syntactic and semantic functor as always coinciding.This has important consequences for the way we treat quantifiedNP's, as we discuss in the next section.
Any of the features ofthe resulting sign may have been further instantiated in the pro-cess of unification.Importantly, (4) states that a functor may place restrictions onany of the dimensions of its argument.
Likewise it willdetermine the role that the information expressed by its argumentplays in the resulting expression.
A UCG sign thus represents acomplex of constraints along several dimensions.4.
1JCG SignsWe now give some example UCG signs.4.1.
Nouns and Adjectives(5) student:noun:\[x\]STUDENT(x)(6) cheerful+W:noun/(W:noun: Ix\]P):\[x\] \[CHEERFUL(x), \[ix\]P\]The reader is invited to work out for herself how the signs (5)and (6) will combine using the rule of forwards application.4.2.
DeterminersFollowing Montague 1973, we treat quantified NPs as type-raisedterms.
We can however take advantage of the polymorphicnature of UCG categories and have a single representation for NPsregardless of their syntactic ontext.
In our analysis, the deter-miner introduces the type raising.
This is the sign thatcorresponds to a.
(7) W(C/(W:C/a+Wl: np\[nom or obj\]:b):\[a\]S)/(Wl:noun:\[b\]R):\[a\]\[\[blR, S\]More verbosely, this says that a combines first with a nounwhich has phonology W1 and semantic index b.
The semanticsthat results from such a combination is a conjunction, the firstconjunct of which is the semantics of the noun.
The second con-junct is the semantics of the resulting NP's argument.
As the NPis type-raised, it has a category of the schematic form:(8) C/(C/np)That is, a type-raised NP will take as its argument some consti-tuent which was itself to combine with a (non-type-raised) NP.When fleshed out with values for the other components of a sign,it will have the form as shown in (9).
Note in particular that, asit is the verb that determines linear order, the phonology of theresulting expression depends on that of the argument o the NP.
(9) shows the result of combining (7) and (5) via forward appli-cation.
(9) WC/(W:C/a+student: rip\[nora orobj\]:b):\[a\]S:\[al\[\[blSTUDENT(b), SlThe sign corresponding to every (10) is very similar to that for a,the major difference being that every introduces DRT implication,notated here with ~.

VerbsThe following is the sign for walks:(11) W+walks:sent\[fin\]/(W:np\[noml:x):\[e\]WALK(e, x)This will combine with file sign (9) a student to yield (12) ofwhich the semantics may be read as: "There is a walking event,of which b is the agent, and b is a student".
(12) a+student+walks:sent\[fin\]:\[e\]\[\[b\]STUDENT(b), WALKS(e, b)\]5.
Modifiers in UCGWe have already seen one category of modifiers, namely adjec-tives, in section 4.1.
We are able to make more general state-ments about modifiers; they all contain instances of the categoryin (13):(13) C/(W:C:S)84Appropriate msldctions on C wilt allow us to describe, forinstance, the class of VP modifiers such as adverbials and auxi-liaries (Cf.
Bouma 1988).
The close relationship between syntaxand semantic,,; allow us to give concise formulations of the dis-tinctions between intersective, vague and intensional modifiers(Kamp 1975).
In the first two cases, the semantics of themodified expression is conjoined with that of the modifyingexpression.
In the vague case, we have to relativize the meaningof the modifying expression to that of the modified.
In the thirdcase, the semantics of the modified expression must be containedwithin the scope of an intensional predicate.
The followingexamples illustrate the three cases.
(14) square+W:noun/(W:noun:\[a\]A):\[allSQUARE(a), AIlarge+W:noun/(W:noun: \[a\]A):\[alILARGE(A, a), AIfake+W:nmm/(W:noun:\[a\]A):\[alFAKE(A)6.
Further ltevelopment of the tlleoryWe have not attempted to give a fully representative list of UCGsigns here.
Elsewhere (Calder, Morns and Zeewtt 1986, Zeevat,Klein and Calder 1987), substantial nalyses of subcategorization,prepositional and adverbial modification, negation, relativeclauses and sentential .connectives have been developed.
Wehave also extended the theory to encompass non-canonical wordorder, using ;t mechanism similm" to the GPSG SLASH (Gazdaret al 1985), and to handle quantificational constraints on ana-phora following the analysis of Johnson and Klein 1986.
Wehave an eftie:ient implementation of the system which representssigns as PROIOG terms, using a different reatment of phonologi-cal informalion.
The use of templates (Shieber et al 1983)allows us to capture generaliztions about clases of lexical items.The compilalion of UCG structures into PROLOG temas is pet-formed by a general processor driven by the definitions of well-formedness of the dimensions of a sign, allowing compile-timetypeocbecking of grammars (Calder, Moens and Zeevat 1986).The system u:;es a tabular shift-reduce parser.7.
Further  6evelopments of UCGThe system described above is deficient in some respects.
Forexample, requiring coincidence between the phonological, syntac-tic and semantic funetors may be too strict.
The problem ofquantifier scoping is a case in point.
Zeevat 1987 suggests relax-ing this requirement to allow linear ordering to become the dom-inant factor in determining semantic functor-argument relations.It seems likely that such a step will also be necessary for certainphonological phenomena.
Current work is investigating the util-ity of associative and commutative unification in this respect.in extending UCG to allow u'eammnt of unbounded ependencyconstructions and partially fi'ee word order, heavy use is made ofuttary rules (Wittenburg 1986).
Current work aims to recast thenotion of unary rule within the framework of paramodularunification (Siekmann 1984).8.
ConclusionAn attractive feature of UCG is the manner in which different lev-els of representation - semantic, syntactic and phonological - arebuilt up simultaneously, by the mfiform device of unification.There axe, of course, different organizing principles at thedifferent levels; conjunction and implication exist at the seman-tic level, but not at the syntactic or phonological.
Nevertheless,the composit:,onal construction of all three levels takes place inthe same manner, namely by the accretion of constraints on pos-sible representations.
Although we have said nothing substantiveabout phonology here, it seems plausible, in the light ofBach and Wheeler 1981 and Wheeler 1981, that the methodologi-cal principles of compositiouality, monotonicity and locality canalso lead to illuminating analyses in the domain of sound stnm-ture.UCG is distinctive in the particular theory of semantic representa-tion which it espouses.
Two iilcidental features of InL mayobscure its relation to DRT.
The first is very minor: our formu-las are linear, rather than consisting of "box-ese".
The seconddifference is that we appear to make no distinction between theset of conditions in it DRS, and the set of discourse markers.
Infact, this is not the case.
A simple recursive definition (similar tothat for "free wtriable" in predicate logic) suffices to constructthe cunmlative set of discourse markers associated with a com-plex condition from indices within a formula.
This definitionalso allows us to capture the constraints on anaphora proposed byDRT.
These departures from the standard DRT formalism do notadversely affect the insights of Kamp's theory, but do offer asubstantial advantage in allowing a rule-by-rule construction ofthe representations, something which has evaded most other ana-lyses in the literature.UCG syntax is heavily polymorphic in the sense that the categoryidentity of a fim~tion application typically depends on the make-up of the argmnent.
Thus, the result of applying a type-raisedNP to a transitive verb phrase is an intransitive verb phrase,while exactly the same functor applied to an intransitive verbphrase will yield a sentence.
Analogously, a prepositionalmoditier applied to a scntence will yield a sentence, while exactlythe same functor applied to a noun will yield a noun.
Thisapproach allows us to dramatically simplify the set of categoriesemployed by the grammar, while also retaining the fundamentalinsight of standard categorial grammar, namely that expressionscombine as fnnctor and argument.
Such a mode of combinationtreats head-complement relations and hcad-moditier relations asspecial cases, and provides an elegant ypology of categories thatcan only be awkwardly mimicked in X-bar syntax.Finally, we note one important innovation.
Standard ctttegorialgrammar postulates a functor-argument pair in semantic rcpresen-ration which parallels the syntactic constituents; typically,lambda-abstraction s required to construct the appropriate flmctorexpressions in semantics.
By contrast, the introduction of signsto the right of the categorial slash means that we subsumesemantic ombinatioi* within a generalized fnnctional application,and the necessity ~{) consmtcting specialized flmctors in thesemantics imply disaopears.ReferencesBach, E. and Wheeler, D.
