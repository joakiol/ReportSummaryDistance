The findings ofgeneral convergence in the Switchboardand BNC corpora are compatible with aninformation-theoretic model of dialogueand with Interactive Alignment Theory.1 IntroductionAccording to Interactive Alignment theory (Pick-ering and Garrod, 2004), mutual understandingin dialogue is helped by a variety of intercon-nected adaptation processes.
Over the course of aconversation, interlocutors?
linguistic productionsassimilate at multiple levels, such as phonemes(Pardo, 2006), lexical choice (Garrod and An-derson, 1987), syntactic structures (Pickering andBranigan, 1998; Branigan et al, 2000; Reitteret al, 2006) and so on.
The alignment at theselevels contributes to the establishment of alignedsituation models between speakers, which is theultimate goal of a successful conversation (Pick-ering and Garrod, 2004; Reitter and Moore, 2007,2014).Alignment does not only refer to the mimickingand repetition of particular linguistic structures;it also includes the convergence at the statisticaland ensemble level, which is known as distribu-tional matching (Abney et al, 2014).
Speech rates(Webb, 1969), probability distributions over syn-tactic forms (Jaeger and Snider, 2008), power lawdistributions of acoustic onset events (Abney et al,2014), and social intent of the speech act (Wanget al, 2015) were all found to match between in-terlocutors.An aspect of accommodation that presumablyvery much helps dialogue partners understandeach other?s language is syntactic complexity.
De-spite rich investigation of alignment in conversa-tion, this property has been largely overlooked inthe analysis of dialogue.The general concept of syntactic complexityhas, of course, been addressed in various ways.
Ineducational psychology and applied linguistics, itis often defined as the degree of sophistication oflanguage forms.
It has broad application in theassessment of second language acquisition (Or-tega, 2003; Lu, 2010, 2011), the readability test(MacGinitie and Tretiak, 1971), and elementaryeducation (Abedi and Lord, 2001).
In computa-tional linguistics, previous studies have shown thatthe syntactic complexity of a sentence is closelyrelated to the amount of information being trans-mitted (Genzel and Charniak, 2002, 2003; Jaegerand Levy, 2006; Jaeger, 2010).
However, as faras we know, syntactic complexity as a high levelfeature of language production has not been inves-tigated under the theoretical lens of the InteractiveAlignment Model (Pickering and Garrod, 2004).Therefore, the focus of this study is to track thesyntactic complexity of different interlocutors asthe conversation develops.
A convergence of sen-tence complexity between interlocutors would becompatible with two pertinent theories.
The firstis the Interactive Alignment Model.
The secondis the Uniform Information Density hypothesis(Jaeger and Levy, 2006; Jaeger, 2010), as it appliesto syntactic structure.
It postulates that speakerswill strive to keep information density approxi-mately constant.
In other words, if one interlocu-tor decreased their rate of information transmis-sion, the other one would increase it in response.As far as syntactic complexity is proportional tothe amount of information, this would imply that ifone interlocutor changes their syntactic complex-443(a) SI VPMDcanVimagine(b) SI VPVBP+RB+ADJP?m not sureSBARWHADVPexactly whereSNPDances with WolvesVPwas filmedFigure 1: Contrast the syntactic complexity of asimple sentence (a) vs. a complex sentence (b).The tree depth of (a) is 4, while the value of (b) is7.

Switchboard contains1126 conversations over the telephone, where eachconversation features exactly two native AmericanEnglish speakers.
From the BNC, we use only asubset of the data that contains spoken conversa-tions with exactly two participants so that the dia-logue structures are consistent with Switchboard.2.2 Metrics of syntactic complexityWe consider three candidate statistics to measurethe syntactic complexity of a sentence: sentencelength (number of words in a sentence), tree depth,and branching factor.
The first two are straight-forward: syntactically complex sentences are typ-ically used to express complex meanings, and thusare more likely to contain more words than simpleones.
More complex syntactic structures, such asrelative clauses and noun clauses, also have deeperparse trees (see Figure 1).The third statistic, branching factor, is definedas the average number of children of all non-leafnodes in the parse tree of a sentence.
In contrastto tree depth, it measures the width of a tree struc-ture, thus a sentence with a larger branching factorlooks flatter.These three statistics are inter-correlated.
Forinstance, tree depth has an almost linear corre-lation with sentence length.
To come up with ameasure that solely characterizes the complexityof a sentence in terms of its tree structure, we nor-malize tree depth and branching factor by exclud-ing the effect of sentence length.
We adopt themethod proposed by Genzel and Charniak (2002).Let f be a complexity measure of a sentence (treedepth or branching factor).
We compute the aver-age measure?f(n) for sentences of the same lengthn (n = 1, 2, .
.
.
):?f(n) =1/|S(n)|?s?S(n)f(s) (1)where s denotes a sentence, and S(n) ={s|l(s) = n} is the set of sentences of length n.The normalized complexity measure is:f?
(s) =f(s)?f(n)(2)This normalized measure f?is not sensitive tosentence length.
This gives us five metrics of com-plexity: sentence length (SL), tree depth (TD),branching factor (BF), normalized tree depth(NTD), and normalized branching factor (NBF).2.3 Topic segmentation and speaker roleassignmentTo verify the hypothesized convergence of a cer-tain statistic between two speakers in dialogue,one possible method is to measure whether thedifference in that statistic becomes smaller as theconversation progresses.
However, this design isoverly simplistic in this case for several reasons.For instance, previous studies have found that sen-tence complexity in written text increases with itsposition (Genzel and Charniak, 2003); thus even ifwe observed that the difference of complexity be-comes smaller, a ceiling effect could be a simplerexplanation.Additionally, the syntactic complexity of a sen-tence largely depends on the amount of meaningthat is conveyed.
Intuitively, when a speaker has alarge amount of information to express, she tendsto use more sophisticated syntactic constructionsLinking this consideration to another very com-mon scenario in dialogue: one interlocutor leadsthe conversation by steering the on-going topics,444lll lll l l l lllllllll l l51015201 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10Within?topic position of sentenceSentencelength(numberof words)ll lll l l l l lllll l l l l l l468101 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10Within?topic position of sentenceTree depthll lll l l l l llllllll l l l1.351.401.451.501.551 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10Within?topic position of sentenceBranching factorgroup l lBNC: follower BNC: leader Switchboard: follower Switchboard: leaderFigure 2: Sentence length (SL), tree depth (TD) and branching factor (BF) against within-topic sentenceposition (the relative position of a sentence from the beginning of the topic episode), grouped by speakerrole, leader vs. follower.

Here,we are not talking about the turn-taking mech-anism in dialogue, which describes the shift atthe utterance level.
Rather, we are describing theshift at a higher level in conversation, the topiclevel, which is formally referred to as topic shiftin Conversation Analysis (Ng and Bradac, 1993;Linell, 1998).
According to these related theories,a complete conversation consists of several topicepisodes.
Some speakers play a more active rolein leading the unfolding of new topic episodes,while others play a more passive role by follow-ing the topic shift.
Beginning a new topic meansbringing in new information, thus it is reasonableto infer that the interlocutor?s syntactic complex-ity would partially depend on whether he is play-ing the leader or the follower.
Considering thefact that the leader vs. follower roles are not fixedamong interlocutors (a previous leader could be afollower later and vise versa), we should not exam-ine the convergence of syntactic complexity withinthe whole conversation.
Rather, we want to zoomin to the finer scale of topic episodes, in which theinterlocutors?
roles are relatively stable.Based on these considerations, we use the Text-Tiling algorithm (Hearst, 1997) to segment theconversation into several topic episodes.
This isa sufficient topic segmentation method for our re-search questions, though it is less sophisticatedcompared to Bayesian models (Eisenstein andBarzilay, 2008) or Hidden Markov Models (Bleiand Moreno, 2001).Within each topic episode that resulted from thesegmentation operation, we assign roles to the twospeakers.
This is based on which of the interlocu-tors is leading this topic episode, as previously ex-plained.
We use two rules to determine this leaderand follower differentiation:Rule I: If the topic episode starts in the middleof the speaking turn of speaker A, then let A be theleader of this topic.Rule II: If the topic episode starts with a com-plete speaking turn, then let the first speaker whocontributes a sentence greater than N words inlength in this episode be the leader.Note that the purpose of Rule II is to select themost probable topic leader, based on the intuitionthat longer sentences are more likely to initiate anew topic.
Thus the determination of the N wordsthreshold here is totally empirical.
We use N =5 as the final threshold, because for N ?
5 ourexperiments draw similar results.3 ResultsFor each sentence in conversation, we computethe five earlier-discussed metrics of syntactic com-plexity: SL, TD, BF, NTD, and NBF.For the first three metrics, SL, TD and BF,we observe convergence between topic leadersand followers, for both corpora (Fig.
2).
Basi-cally, topic leaders have higher syntactic complex-ity measures at the early stage of a topic episode,which drops gradually as the topic develops.
Theconverse holds for topic followers.

Thus, a general trend seemssupported.
As NBF is the only metric that is lowerin leaders and higher in followers, it could actuallybe an index for syntactic simplicity.4 Discussion and ConclusionBy segmenting a conversation into several topicepisodes, and then differentiating the interlocutorsin terms of their roles in initiating the topic, leaderor follower, we show that the syntactic complex-ity of the two interlocutors converges within topicepisodes.
The syntactic complexity of the topicleader decreases, while the complexity of the topicfollower increases.From an information-theoretical point of view,the syntactic complexity of a sentence is closelyrelated to its amount of lexical information or neg-ative entropy (Genzel and Charniak, 2002, 2003).By starting a new topic in conversation, the lead-ing speaker brings novelty to the existing con-text, which often involves relatively long and com-plex utterances.
On the other hand, the follow-ing speaker has to accommodate this change ofcontext, by first producing short acknowledgingphrases at the early stage, and gradually increase446his contribution as the topic develops.
Therefore,the convergence of syntactic complexity withina topic episode is a reflection of the process inwhich two interlocutors contribute jointly to buildup common ground (Clark and Brennan, 1991)with respect to a certain topic.We find our results explained the theoreticalframeworks of common ground (Clark, 1996) andthe Interactive Alignment Model (IAM, Picker-ing and Garrod, 2004), models which are some-times characterized as opposing accounts of coor-dination in dialogue.
From the common-groundperspective of language-as-activity, interlocutorsplay different roles in dialogue, and the coordi-nation between these roles facilitates the success-ful unfolding of dialogue.
Our account identifiestwo such macro-level roles: topic leader vs. fol-lower.
From the perspective of Interactive Align-ment, interactions between interlocutors in a di-alogue are accompanied by the alignment of lin-guistic elements at multiple levels, including syn-tactic rules.
Thus, the micro-level convergenceof syntactic complexity is predicted by the IAM.Therefore, our findings point to the possibility ofa unified perspective that combines the two theo-ries.It is worth pointing out that we present somenovel ideas about the scope of convergence.
Ex-isting studies focus on the alignment effect that isobservable throughout the whole conversation.
Inour case, the convergence of syntactic complexityoccurs within smaller scope: the topic episodes.Note that the direction of convergence is dynamic:a speaker of higher complexity in one episodemight be of lower complexity in the next episode,depending on her role.
The next questions aris-ing from these patterns mirror those asked of othertypes of alignment: is complexity alignment pur-poseful, is it controlled by individual differencesor situational goals, and can it predict task suc-cess?
We leave these questions for future work.AcknowledgmentsThis work has been funded by the National Sci-ence Foundation under CRII IIS grant 1459300.ReferencesJamal Abedi and Carol Lord.
