Comparing corpora and lexical ambiguityPatrick RuchMedical Informafics DivisionGeneva University Hospil~Switzerlandruch@dim.hcuge.chArnaud GaudinatLATLUniversity of GenevaSwitzerlandgaudinat @latl.unige.chAbstractIn this paper we compare two types ofcorpus, focusing on the lexical mnbiguity ofeach of them.
The first corpns consistsmainly of newspaper articles and Hteratureexcerpts, while the second belc)ngs to themedical domain.
To conduct he study, wehave used two different disambiguationtools.
However, first of all, we must verifythe performance of each system in itsrespective application domain.
We then usethese systems in order to assess and compareboth the general ambiguity rate and theparticularities of each domain.
(mantitativeresults show that medical documents arelexically less ambiguous than tmrestrieteddocuments.
Our conclusions show theimportance of the application area in thedesign of NLP tools.Introduction and backgroundAlthough some large-scale valuations carriedout on unrestricted texts (Hersh 1998a, Spark-Jones 1999), and even on medical documents(Hersh 1998b), conclude in a quite critical wayabout using NLP tools for information retrieval,we believe that such tools are likely to solvesome lexical ambiguity issues.
We also believethat some special settings -particular to theapplication area- must be taken into accountwhile developing such NLP tools.Let us recall two major problems whileretrieving documents with NLP engines (Salton,1988):1-Expansion: the user is generally as interestedin retrieving documents with exactly the samewords, as in retrieving documents withsemantically related words (synonyms, generics,specifics...).
Thus, a query based on the wordliver, should be able to retrieve documentscontaining words such as hepatic.
Thisexpansion process is usually thesaurus-based.The thesaurus can be built manually orautomatically (as, for ex~ple,  in Nazarenko,1997).2-Disambiguation: a search based on tokens mayretrieve irrelevant documents since tokens areoften lexically ambiguous.
Thus, face can referto a body part, as a noun, or an action, as a verb.Finally, this latter problem may be split into twosub problems.
The disambiguafion task can bebased on parts-of-speech (POS) or word-sense(WS) information, but the chronological relationis still a discussion within the community.Although, the target of our work (Ruch and al.,1999, Bouillon and al., 2000) is a free-grainedsemantic disambiguation f medical texts for IRpurposes, we believe that the POSdisambiguation is an important preliminary step.Therefore this paper focuses on POS tagging,and compares morpho-syntacfic lexicalambiguities (MSLA) in medical texts to MSLAin unrestricted corpora.Although the results of the study conform topreliminary naive expectations, the method isquite original I.
Most of the comparative studies,dedicated to corpora, have addressed theproblem by applying metrics on words entitiesor word pieces (as in studies working with n-I We do not claim to be pioneer in the domain, asothers authors (Biber 1998, Folch and al., 2000) axeexploring similar metrics.
However, it is interestingto notice that for these authors the adaptation ftheNLP tools has rarely been questioned in a technicalpoint-of view, and in order to feed back the design ofNLP systems.14gram strings), or on special sets of words (theindexing terms, see Salton, 1988) as in thespace-vector model (see Kilgariff, 1996, for asurvey of these methods), whereas the presentpaper attempts to compare corpora t a morpho-syntactic (MS) level1 Validating each tagger into its respectivedomainIn order to conduct he comparative study, weused two different morphological analysers;each one has a specific lexicon tailored for itsapplication field.
The first system is specialisedfor tagging medical texts (Ruch and al., 2000),while the second is a general parser (based onFIPS, cf.
Wehrli, 1992).For comparing lexical ambiguities on a minimalcommon base, the output of each morphologicalanalyser is first mapped into its respective tagset(more than 300 fine-grained tags for FIPSTAG,and about 80 for the morpheme-based medicaltagger).
The tagsets are then converted into asubset of the medical tagger.
FinaUy, about 50different items constitute this minimal commontagset (MCT), which will serve for comparingboth corpora.We collected two different sets of documents obe tagged at a lexical level via the predefinedMCT: this step provides a set of tags to everytoken.
This set of tags may come from thelexicon or from the POS guesser.
As we areusing guessers, the empty set (or the tag forunknown tokens) is forbidden.
However, first ofall, it is necessary to verify the lexical coverageof each system for each corpus, as we need to besure that the lexical ambiguities provided byeach system are necessary and sufficient.The corpus of the unrestricted texts consists of16003 tokens: about one third of newspaperarticles (Le Monde), one third of  literatureexcerpts (provided by the InaLF,http://www.inalf.fr), and a smaller third beingmainly texts for children.
Approximately aquarter (3987 tokens) of  this corpus is used forevaluating FIPSTAG tagging results (the tooltogether with some explanations can be found athttp://latl.unige.ch).
In parallel, we chose threetypes of medical texts to make up the medicalcorpus: it represents 16024 tokens, with 3 equalthirds: discharge summaries, surgical reports,and laboratory or test results (in this case, tableswere removed).
Again, a regularly distributedquarter (4016) of this corpus is used forassessing the medical tagger.The test samples used for assessing the results ofeach tagger are annotated manually beforemeasuring the performances, but in both caseswe sometimes had to modify the wordsegmentation of  the test samples.
This isparticularly true for FIPSTAG, which handlesseveral acceptable but unusual collocations(which gather more than one 'word'), as forexample n avion (in Eng.
by plane), which isconsidered as one lexical item, tagged as anadverb.
For the lexical tagger we had to modifythe "word' segmentation i the other direction(for tagging items smaller than 'words'), asmorphemes were also tagged.
Table 1 gives theresults for FIPSTAG, and table 2 gives theresults for the medical tagger.
In the case of  themedical tagger, together with the error rate andthe success rate, we provide results of  theresidual ambiguity rate: the basic idea is that thesystem does not attempt to solve what it is notlikely to solve well (cf.
Ruch and al.
2000, asimilar idea can be found in Silberztein 1997).1 Correct ag 3959 (99.3%)1 Incorrect tag 28 (0.7%)Tab.

2: Evaluation of the medical taggerA comparison of the tagging scores (99.3 vs.98.5) confirms that both systems behave in anequivalent way in their respective applicationarea  2.2 Out of curiosity, we ran each tagger on a smallsample of the other domain.
The tests were madewithout any adaptation.
FIPSTAG made 27 errors ina medical sample of 849 tokens, i.e.
an error rate of3.2%.
The medical tagger made 18 errors in a generalsample of 747 tokens, which means an error rate of2.4%.
In the case of the medical tagger, 41 tokens152 Morphological analysers, lexicons andguessersLexical ambiguities have two origins: thelexicon, and the guessing stages :for unknowntokens.
However, all the ambiguities consideredin this study are strictly lexical, and sotranslation phenomena (Tesni6r'e 1959, andParoubek 1997) are not considered \]here.2.1 Medical lexiconThe medical lexicon is tailored to biomedicaltexts, thus, with about 20000 lexemes, it coversexhaustively ICD-10.
The biomedical languageis not only a "big' sub language, as itsmorphology is also more complex.
This highlevel of composition (at least compared toregular French or English languages) concernsabout 10% of tokens within clinical patientrecords; therefore the lexicon contains alsoabout 2000 affixes.
For example, the tokenil~ojdjunostoraie s absent from the lexicon,however, this type of token may be recognizedvia its compounds ( ee Levis and al., 1997, forthe so-called morphosemantemes): il~o, jdjuno,and stomie.2.2 Morphological analysis and medicalmorphologyThe morphological analysis associates everysurface form with a list of morpho-syntacticfeatures.
When the surface form is not found inthe lexicon, it follows a two.step guessingprocess: the first level (oraclel) is a morecomplex morphological nalyzer, based on themorphosemantemes, while the second levelguesser (orcale2) attempts to provides a set ofMS features looking at the longest ending (asdescribed in Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995).The importance of these two levels is not clearfor POS tagging, but becomes manifest whendealing with sense tagging.
Let us consider threeexamples of tokens absent fxom the lexicon:allomorphiques, allomorphiquement (equivalentto allomorphic and allomorphically in Eng.remained ambiguous aRer disambiguafion, theresidual ambiguity is therefore about 5.5%.
In thissample, and before disambiguation, the number ofambiguous tokens was 150, which means anambiguity rate of 20%.
Thus, even using the samelexicon, the ambiguity rate seem higher for generalcorpora than for domain-specific ones.language) and allocution.
In the first case, theprefix allo and the sufFm morphiques are listedin the morphosemantemes database (MDB).
Inthe second case, morphiquement is not listedwithin the MDB, but ment can be found in it, Inthese two cases, therefore, oraclel is able toprovide both the MS and the WS informationassociated.
The latter example cannot be splitinto any morphemes, as cution is absent from theMDB.
Thus, oraclesl is unable to recogniTe it,and finally oracle2 will be applied and willprovide some MS features regarding exclusivelythe endings.
The major ole given to oraclel andthe semantic featu_es it provides is obvious forIR purposes.The final stage transforms ome of the lexicalfeatures returned by the morphological nalysisin a tag-like representation to be processed laterby the tagger.2.3 FIPSTAG tagger and lexiconThe FIPSTAG lexicon is a general Frenchlexicon, therefore it contains most well-formedFrench words.
The overall structure of thelexicon is mere or less stable, but the content isregularly updated in order to improve thecoverage.
Currently, the coverage is about200000 words with around 30000 lexical items.The lexicon is designed for deep parsing, so that,together with classical morpho.syntacticfeatures, we can also find sub categorization ofverbs, semantic features, and some very specificgrammatical classes.As the system is claimed to be general, it issupposed to master efficiently any unknownwords: the lexical modules supply, in anequiprobable way, all the possible lexicalcategories (i.e.
nouns, verbs, adjectives, andadverbs), as other categories are considered tobe exhaustively listed in the lexicon.Consequently, the guesser does not rely on anymorphological information, and only syntacticprinciples are applied to choose the relevantfeatures.3.

Column 2provides the ratio of similarity (maximum similarity3 This class has only one representative within themedical corpus, the word patient (femininepatiente) : An equivalent within the general corpus ispolitique (in Eng.
it means both political andpolitic, s), but the former (0.5% of tokens) is ten timesmore frequent than the latter (0.05%).
The frequencyof the word politique is consistent with the frequencylists distributed by Jean V6ronis (http://www.up.univ-mrs-fr/~veronis), which were calculated on a onemillion words corpus from Le Monde Diplomatique(1987-1997).
It should noted that his result questionsthe concepts of "unrestricted corpora' and'representativeness" (Biber, 1994), as in fact it oRenrefers to a mix of politics and newspaper topics != 1, minimal similarity = 0 and 5) between thefrequency of the considered ambiguity in medical(Fm.)

But we mustnotice that the original MULTEXT description andthe GRACE version (Paroubek and al.
1998, Rajmanand ai.
1997) for the French language have not beenforeseen for annotating morphemes.Previously, while attempting to assess theperformance of  our tools, only a sample of thead hoc corpus we built up was used, whereas thefollowing studies on the ambiguities will becarried out on the whole corpus.
Like in thevalidation task, the lexical ambiguities are basedon the morphological analysis of each tagger,expressed in the MCT.
First of all, table 3 givesthe general ambiguity rate in each corpora: itclearly states that the total ambiguity rate ingeneral corpora is about twice as big as inmedical texts.A more precise table (tab.
4) provides at leasttwo remarkable r sults.
First, it shows that in thegeneral corpus, less than a dozen words areresponsible for half of the global ambiguity rate.These results must be compared to (Chanod andTapainen, 1995), who situate this numberaround 16, while about six words generate thesame level of  ambiguity in the medical corpus!This table also shows that the distribution of  theambiguity type is also domain dependant.
Thus,the ambiguity d\[fs\]-\[bs\]/proc is twice morefrequent in medical texts, and the ambiguityrepresented by the tokens patient/patiente(masculine and feminine form of patient; which17may be a noun, an adjective, or some form ofverb) is five times more frequent.
On thecontrary, some classes of ambiguity are simplyabsent or very rare in the medical domain (as forexample v\[12\]/v\[s03\], or nc\[ms\]/v\[n\]).Finally, in table 5, we give the distribution of themost frequent syntactic ategories according tothe corpus.
In this table, a particularly interestingresult concerns the imbalance betweencategories of noun phrases (detetTniner, noun,adjective...) and categories of 'verb phrases(verb, adverb...); the former being much morefrequent in medical texts, whereas the latter aremore frequent in general texts.
Here we verify awell-known stylistic manner: medical reports areoften written in a telegraphic sty\]te, where theverb is frequently implicit.
As a corollary,nominalization phenomena re very frequent.Simple or complex numeral tokens (date, time,expressions with digits and measure symbols)are also much more frequent.Generalr 505v\[n\] 721tees 765v\[12\]; v\[s03\]; 837v\[p03\]sp 1356d 1659nc 1707f 2179Medical276 v\[n\]301 v\[12\]; v\[s03\];v\[p03\]550 q5871 tees\[1283; a1529 !

Discussion and conclusionWe have showed that the lexical ambiguity inmedical texts (considered as a paradigm of anyparticular domain) is different o the one ingeneral texts, both at a purely quantitative l vel,and at a deeper qualitative l vel.
Another esultconcerns the difference in the distribution of thePOS categories.
All these particularities must beadded to others: lexical, morphological, spellingand grammar errors.
This last point has beenrarely studied, but errors in documents, whichare not intended for publication, may be quiteimpressive (the spelling error rate in our medicalcorpus was about 2%, i.e.
up to one error everyfive sentences!).
Finally, our conclusion is oftwo types: First, concerning the study, weshowed that the use and comparison of taggerstailored for different corpora, supports ameasureof the difference between these corpora; second,at a more methodological level, if  it seems thatthe syntax may be -?eteris paribus- regarded as adomain-independent field (at least at acomputational level, ef.
Wehrli 1995), weargued that natural language processingappfications require domain-adaptable tools.Therefore, the use of NLP tools by otherresearch fields must be very carefully related tothe design of these tools.
We suggest thatadaptability should be explored in at least threedirections4:1.
Systems must allow lexical items to beadded (custom lexicon) and removed fromthe lexicon; therefore access to the mainlexicon must be available - at leastnegatively.2.
Systems must be optionally applied with aspecialised morphological nalyser module.3.
MS description (tagset) should beparametrable, and this should include theability to provide a mapping table.AcknowledgementsThis study was supported by the FNRS (SwissNational Science Foundation).ReferencesDouglas Biber (1994) Representativeness inCorpus Design.
