INTRODUCTIONAs we are facing the growing amount of on-line text, the use of text analysis techniques toaccess information from electronic sources has become more popular and, at the same time,more difficult.
Currently, the effectiveness of such techniques is evaluated not only on how easilythey can be applied to text sources to extract information and represent it in a systematic format(Walker 1983), but also on whether they can be applied to large text corpora of several tens ofthousand of words.One of the applications of text analysis is to identify and extract significant erminology fromrunning text.
Choueka (1988), for example, describes an experiment for locating interestingcollocational expressions from large textual databases.
A collocational expression, as Chouekadefines it, is =sequences of words whose unambiguous meaning cannot be dedved from that oftheir components".
Other representative collocation research can be found in Church and Hanks(1990) and Smadja (1993).
Though all statistically-based, their definitions of collocations aredifferent from one another.
Unlike Choueka (1988), Church and Hanks (1990) identify ascollocations both interrupted and uninterrupted sequences of words.
Unlike Church and Hanks(1990), Smadja (1993) goes beyond the "two-word" limitation and deals with "collocations ofarbitrary length".131The primary goal of collocation research is to build a comprehensive lexicographic toolkit, or toassist automatic language generation applications.
Therefore, the focus is on the extraction of allInteresting word pattems without distinction of domain specificity.
Identifying domain-specificterminology is another research effort.
Gierl and Frost (1992) descdbe their approach toextracting terminological knowledge from medical texts.
Following Church and Hanks (1990),they use mutual information to select significant wo-word patterns, but, at the same time, alexical inductive process is incorporated which, as they claim, can improve the collection ofdomain-specific terms.
Justeson and Katz (1993) introduce an algorithm by which technicalterms in running text can be identified.
Prior to the development of their algorithm, theyperformed a thorough study on the linguistic properties of technical terminology.
They report that,structurally, technical terms make heavy use of noun compounds.
In technical terminology, wordconstituents are limited to adjectives, nouns and occasionally prepositions.
Verbs, adverbs, orconjunctions are extremely rare.
At the discourse level, technical terms tend to be repetitive.
Withthese observations in mind, they developed an algorithm which has proved to be effective anddomain independent.In this paper, a preliminary experiment is presented in automatically suggesting significant ermsfor a predefined topic.
The general method is to compare a topic focused sample based on thepredefined topic with a larger and more general base sample.
A set of statistical measures areused to identify significant word units in both samples.
Identification of single word terms isbased on the notion of word intervals.
Two-word terms are identified through the computation ofmutual information, and an extension of mutual information assists in capturing multi-word terms.Once significant erms of all these three types are identified, a comparison algorithm is applied todifferentiate terms across the two samples.
If significant changes in the values of certainstatistical variables are detected, associated terms are selected from the focused sample asbeing topic-oriented and included in a suggested list.To check the quality of the suggested terms, we compare them against terms manuallydetermined by a domain expert.
Though the numbers of matches vary, we find that our automaticsuggestion process provides more terms (than the manual process) that are useful for describingthe predefined topic.2.
METHODOLOGY2.1 Manual versus Automatic Term SuggestionTO manually select significant erms for a predefined topic, the domain expert first creates a topicfocused sample from one specific source or a combination of sources.
Then, he or she reads thedocuments, providing a relevance judgment (i.e.
a reader-assigned score) to each document.
Bycarefully examining relevant documents in the focused sample, a list of terms that are deemed tobe significant for the definition of the topic is identified.
In many cases, it is possible that thedomain expert would introduce some terms based on his or her own professional knowledgeabout the topic.
These terms may be highly prominent for the topic, yet may not necessarilyoccur in the focused sample.132For automatic suggestion of topical terms, initial attempts were made using the sampledocuments the domain expert created.
The results were not impressive.
The statisticalInformation generated from the sample documents was not rich and sufficient enough for anydiscriminative judgment.
Our experience showed that, to draw terms that are reflective of a giventopic, a much larger and more general base sample is required.
Such a base sample should berandomly sampled from the same source as the focused sample and it should contain an array ofdifferent opics.
Once the baseline statistics are generated from both data collections, ameaningful comparison could spot terms that occur with unusual frequency in the focusedsample.
These terms would constitute good candidates for topically sensitive terminological units(Steier and Belew 1994).2.2 Focused Sample and Base SampleFor our experiments of automatic term suggestion, we selected a predefined topic called"European Politics and Business".
The focused sample was originally created by the domainexpert using the 1988 United Press International (UPI).
Table 1 presents statistical informationabout this dataset.
After reading each of the relevant documents found in the focused sample,the domain expert manually determined 347 topical terms.
Table 2 provides the statisticalbreakdown of these terms.Table 1: Focused and Base SamplesData File Source/Name Size (bytes) Unique WordsFocused Sample Sample from 1988 UPI 1,015200 12,065 (5,045")Base Sample Sample from 27,322,598 73,583 (33,114")1987,1988,1989 UPI* only words which occur more than 3 times were used in the experimentsTable 2: Predefined Topic and its Manually Determined Topical TermsPredefined Topic one-word two.word multi.word total termsiEuropean Politics& Business 276 36 35 347Since the focused sample was drawn from the source of 1988 UPI, the construction of itscorresponding base sample was also initiated from the same source of the same year.
Ourexperiments demonstrated that, in order to obtain a random assortment of topics to be includedin the base sample, it may be meaningful to sample documents from the time pedod before andafter the focused documents.
Therefore, the final base sample was created by randomly drawingdocuments from the years of 1987, 1988 and 1989.
The size of this dataset is about 27 timeslarger than the sample data file (see Table 1 ).133Though the ratio between the focused and base samples was arbitrary, in order to generatemeaningful statistics, we felt that the base sample should be at least 20 times larger in size thanthe focused sample.
(For the sake of discussion, hereafter, we may sometimes refer to thefocused sample as "focused" and the base sample as "base".
)2.3 Experimental ProcedureThe general method we adopted is as follows.
First, we identified statistically significant ermsfrom both samples.
Next, a comparison algorithm was applied to these two sets of terms tosingle out those that were common to both samples, yet whose patterns of occurrences differedbetween these two samples.
Finally, we analyzed and presented this set of terms as contentodented candidates for the predefined topic, in this case "European Politics and Business".The terms suggested are split into three categones: single word terms, two-word terms andmulti-word terms (or phrases).
The following three sections descnbe in detail the methods forgenerating each of the three categories.2.4 Suggesting Single Word TermsAutomatically suggesting single word terms as being topically oriented has been mostchallenging.
Our experiments indicated that the ffirst order" statistics, probability and entropyalone, are not sufficient for gathering information about the topicality of a word in running text.The information in both measurements is essentially equivalent since entropy is just the loginverse of probability.We found that the "second-order" statistics, such as vadance or standard deviation of termfrequencies across documents, provide greater insight into topicality.
We selected the intervalbetween the occurrences of a word as the basis for analysis.
Our intuitions led us to believe thattopical single words should appear more frequently and more regularly, i.e.
at approximatelyeven intervals, in the focused sample than in the base sample.
The focused sample represents,more or less, a topical sublanguage set while the base sample a general language set.
Unlikeprobability and entropy statistics which yield average scores for the whole document, the use ofinterval makes it possible to get an "instantaneous" measure at any location in the document.More specifically, an interval can be measured "instantaneously" at any point in the text betweenthe occurrences of a particular word.
Though using interval alone might still not be sufficient foridentifying word topicality, it allowed us to measure the vadance which would help identify wordsthat were always changing in their rate of occurrences.Thus, three scores were generated for each word: the mean log interval, the standard deviationof the mean log interval, and the normalized standard deviation of the mean log interval.
The useof a log scale for these measurements is to minimize the effect of unduly large variations inwords with long mean intervals.
The normalized standard deviation is produced by simplydividing the raw standard deviation by the mean log interval.
In most cases, raw standarddeviation is found to be larger for words having long mean intervals.
In order to compare thestandard deviations across words of different intervals, we found this normalization process quiteuseful.134iAfter scores were generated for all the words in both the focused sample and the base sample,score comparisons between the two samples were carried out in two ways: comparing theintervals and comparing the standard deviations.To compare the intervals, the =base" mean log interval was subtracted from the "focused" meanlog Interval and divided by the raw standard deviation from the base sample.
The resultrepresents the change of mean log intervals.
More explicitly, it yields the number of standarddeviations that the "focused" mean log interval is different from the =base" mean log interval.
Themore negative;the value, the more significant he change, and the more prominent he wordwould appear in the focused sample.To compare the standard deviations, the normalized =base" standard deviation was subtractedfrom the normalized "focused" standard deviation.
The difference symbolizes how the word isdistributed in ~e focused sample.
The more negative the value is, the more "bursty" the word isdistributed, and the more likely it is content oriented since "content words tend to appear in'bursts" (Church and Mercer 1993).If a single word term is found in both data samples and it receives negative scores from bothinterval and standard deviation comparisons, it would be included in the suggested list as beingtopical onented.2.5 Suggesting Two-Word TermsThe method for suggesting two-word terms tumed out to be much simpler than that for singleword terms though the same techniques are equally applicable.
Here, the traditional mutualinformation score was used.
As stated in Church, et al (1991) and elsewhere, the mutualinformation measurement can be expressed as:.
( :p (WlW2) )l(WlW2) = l?g~,p(wl)p(w2)where p(wlw2) is the frequency in the data collection of the two-word compound (wl ,w2); andp(wl) and p(w2) the frequency of the word constituents.
The highest mutual information scoreindicates that the individual probabilities are low while the two words occur together frequently.Two steps led to our automatic suggestion of topic-oriented two-word terms.
First, the mutualinformation score was computed for each pair of words that occur in each of the two samples.
Tocapture topicality, we were only interested in pairs of words with high mutual information scores.Therefore, any pair which contained =closed class" words, such as determiners, prepositions,auxiliaries, or single letters, digit numbers, or overly common verbs like "give", "take", etc., wereexcluded.
Such an exclusion not only helped getting pairs of words with high mutual informationscores, but also sped up computation significantly.
A threshold value was also set such that ifany two-word unit occurred less than 3 times in the sample or received a mutual informationscore lower than 6.0, it was eliminated and would not participate in the next comparisonmeasurement.135With the mutual information scores in hand, a "delta" score was generated by subtracting the"base" mutual information score from the ffocused" mutual information score.
Topically,prominent wo-word terms normally have lower scores in the focused sample that is "keyed" totheir topic.
This is because the constituent words distribute in wider range of contexts.
Theprobability of them occurring separately increases relative to the probability of them occurringtogether (Steier and Belew 1994).
Therefore, the more negative the "delta" score, the moretopically sensitive the two-word term is.If a two-word term occurs in both data samples and receives a negative "delta" score, it would beincluded in the suggested list as being topically onented.2.6 Suggesting Multi-Word TermsWhen automatically suggesting content two-word terms, we looked at the mutual informationscores for adjacent words.
For multi-word terms, the mutual information score was calculated fornon-adjacent words.
Our intuitions led us to believe that if there is a significant statistical linkage,i.e.
a high mutual information score, between such a pair of words, it is highly possible that theybelong to a larger linguistic component.Our first step was to compute mutual information scores for a word unit separated by a distanceof two (i.e.
having one unspecified word separating them).
Two cdteda apply when selecting"interesting" word units.
Their mutual information score must be 10 or greater.
Following theobservations by Steier and Belew (Steier and Belew1994), we only selected pairs which receivedlower mutual information score in the focused sample than in the base sample.Once an "interesting" word unit of distance two was selected, a concordance was built of allsentences containing that word unit.
These sentences were compared for matching text.
If astdng of text was found to include that word unit and, at the same time, occur most frequently inthe concordance, its leading and trailing "closed-set" words (if any) were chopped off.
Theremaining text stdng was presented as a suggested multi-word term.3.
RESULTS and DISCUSSION3.1 Suggested Single TermsThe focused sample drawn from the 1988 UPI data contains 12,065 unique words.
Among them,5,045 are frequent enough (occurring 3 times or more) to calculate statistics for our experiments(refer to Table 1).
The comparison algorithm identified 2,010 suggested terms based on the factthat they received negative scores for both "change of mean log interval" and "distributionburstiness" comparisons.
These negative scores indicate that these single word terms haveshorter intervals and more regular occurrences in the focused sample.We compared the suggested list against the single word terms manually selected by the domainexpert.
The results are summarized in Table 3.136Table 3: Statistics of the Suggested Single Word Termssuggested2,010Comparison of Suggested and Manual Termstotalmanual276notpossible*129nostatistics*91possible*56hits42percentincluded75%* not possible: terms not existing In the focused sample* no statbtics: terms which have less than 3 occurrences in the focused sample* possible: targeted termsOf the 276 topical single terms determined by the domain expert, 129 terms do not exist in thefocused sample.
As explained earlier, these are the terms intellectually introduced by the domainexpert.
Almost half of these terms are geographical names in Europe, such asalbania, albertville, andorra, barcelona, belarus, belorus, bosnia, byelorussia, chancellors,comecon, cp, croatia, erm, eurocurrency, eurofed, europeanization, europeanwide,europeenne, europewide, gaullist, gaullists, gilbraltar, greenland, guemsey, kazakhstan,kirghizia, kirgizia, kyrgystan, kzakhstan, labour, liechtenstein, moldavia, moldova, monaco,nc, nib, nicosia, nuuk, pentagonale, reunify, reykjavik, salzburg, sicily, slovenia, svalbard,tadzhikistan, tajikistan, tajikstan, tirana, tirane, tories, torshavn, turkmenia, turkmenistan,uk, ussr, uzbekistan, vaduz, valletta, weuOf the remaining 147 actually occurring terms, 91 are not frequent enough to be included in ourexperiments.

Of these, 42 were caught with an accuracy rate of 75% (seeAppendix for details).Further analysis of the missing 14 terms reveals that they were not found in the suggested listdue to the statistical constraints we established for our experiments.
As shown in Table 4, 13 ofthese terms received negative scores either for "change of mean log interval" or for "distributionburstiness', but not for both.
We believe that their inclusion is possible since they represent whatwe would call "border-line" suggested terms.137Table 4: =Missed" single word termssingle.word term dgtl dgt2 dgt3 dgt4 dgt5 dgt6 dgt7 dgt8portugal 10 13.75 0.26 16.86 0.23 3.83 -0.81 0.03europeans 23 12.55 0.35 15.64 0.32 4.98 -0.62 0.03eec 3 15.49 0.39 19.28 0.32 6.21 -0.61 0.06luxembourg 12 13.49 0.42 17.06 0.36 6.07 -0.59 0.07!copenhagen 3 15.49 0.47 18.54 0.34 6.23 -0.49 0.14i;~ cyprus 6 14.49 0.44 18.28 0.43 7.89 -0.48 0.01yugoslavia 12 13.49 0.47 15.33 0.37 5.66 -0.32 0.10finland 10 13.75 0.51 15.52 0.46 7.19 -0.25 0.05kgb 5 14.75 0.57 16.41 0.44 7.29 .-0.23 0.13sweden 13 13.38 0.48 14.26 0.44 6.33 -0.14 0.03turkey 11 13.62 0.53 14.47 0.50 7.25 -0.12 0.03czechoslovakia 9 13.91 0.09 13.70 0.46 6.29 0.03 -0.36switzerland 9 13.91 0.21 13.81 0.47 6.48 0.01-0.26Statistics Measurements (dgt = digit)dgtl: number of occurrences On the focused sample)dgt2: mean log interval (in the focused sample)dgt3: normalized SD of mean log interval (in the focused sample)dgt4: mean log interval (in the base sample)dgtS: normalized SD of mean log interval (in the base sample)dgt6: raw SD of mean log interval (in the base sample)dgt7: ((2nd digit - 4th digit) / 6th digit))dgtS: (3rd digit.
Sth digit)Admittedly, the suggested list with the total of 2,010 terms is a fairly large one.
It obviouslycontains terms that are not topic oriented.
We followed the observations made by Justeson andKatz (1993) and introduced a =post-editing" process.
As a result, the list was reduced to 886terms.
Basically, we removed from the original ist all the =closed-set" words such as determiners,prepositions, auxiliaries, conjunctions, single letters, etc., as well as other less semanticallyladen words such as adverbs and verbs.3.2 Suggested Two-Word TermsAmong 512 =interesting" two-word terms, 170 receive negative =delta" scores.
These 164 termswere presented in our suggested two-word terms (see Appendix for details).138IA total of 36 topical terms were manually determined based on the UPI focused sample.
Of thisnumber, only 26 are actually existent erms, which means that 10 terms were introducedindependent of the source material.
Among these 26 terms, 6 were too infrequent o generatemeaningful statistics though the mutual information scores are high (see Table 5).

cold war, commonmarket, and North Sea) were actually captured in the 512 "interesting" list.
They were notincluded in the suggested list because they did not receive negative "delta" scores.
Thesuggested list fails to include 4 manually selected two-word terms because their mutualinformation scores go up.
Typically, content oriented two-word terms within the topically relatedsubset of documents are expected to go down.
This might be caused by the individual wordprobabilities.
To use Steier and Belew's terms (Steier and Belew 1994), these pairs appear more"opaque", meaning that their constituent words are more probable individually than when theyare combined inthe focused sample.
Table 7 lists these 4 two-word terms appearing in bothsamples.139Table 7: "Missed" two-word termsSample two-word term frequency MI score"base" atlantic alliance 11 8.80256520"focused" atlantic alliance 4 9.36193333"base" cold war 54 8.04486800"focused" cold war 11 9.97241419"base" common market 26 6.86310460"focused" common market 17 7.84030540"base" 49"focused"united kingdomunited kingdom 257.553531607.80705217Our suggested two-word terms list (see the Appendix) contains quite a number of usefuladditional terms about the targeted predefined topic "European Politics and Business".

Admittedly, some of them are simply sentence fragments insteadof real phrases.Of the 35 multi-word terms manually selected by the domain expert, 26 actually occur in thefocused sample.
As with the single word and two-word terms, the other 9 multi-word terms aresimply intellectual introductions from the domain expert.
Of the 26 tenns, 22 occur frequentlyenough to generate meaningful statistics.
Out of these 22 catchable terms, only 5 are included inthe suggested list.
Table 8 presents the statistical summary.140Table 8: Statistics of the Suggested Multi-Word Termstotalsuggested97Comparison of Suggested and Manual Termstotalmanual35notpossible*nostatistics*4possible*!

These two-word terms typically generate fairly lowmutual information scores since the constituent words occur frequently by themselves.It is important o point out that the suggested list does contain a number of useful multi-wordterms that are related to the targeted predefined topic =European Politics and Business".

CONCLUSIONThis paper presents a preliminary experiment in identifying significant erminological units fromrunning text.
By comparing a focused sample randomly drawn for a predefined topic against alarger and more general base sample, we can automatically suggest topic-oriented terms basedon the detection of significant changes in some statistical measurements.
Our experiment on onepredefined topic demonstrated that, compared to the manual selection of the topical terms, oursuggested lists do contain more useful terms that can be used to descdbe the topic.
We alsofound that the method is efficient enough for applications to very large textual corpora.
Our nextstep is to further refine the methods by carrying out more experiments across different opics.
Wementioned a number of times that our methods were developed based on our intuitiveassumptions or hypotheses.
More experiments on more topics will prove whether we can obtainpositive and consistent results.Identification of significant erms from running text can be very useful in building intelligentinformation management systems.
Terms identified are good candidates for key word indexing ofelectronic sources.
Topic specificity can assist in grouping or clustering on-line documents.
Foran information retrieval system, terms identified for a pre-determined subject can be used todevelop specialized libraries or files for targeted user groups.
Our experiment demonstrated thatthe methods described can identify vadous people names, organization enlJties and other propernames.
Those special text tokens are important for constructing text extraction systems.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis research was done while the second author worked at LEXIS-NEXIS dudng the summer of1994.
