Traditional menu-drivennavigation and key word search do not allow users to describetheir intentions precisely.
We have developed a conversationalinterface to online shopping that provides convenient,personalized access to information using natural languagedialog.
User studies show significantly reduced length ofinteractions in terms of time and number of clicks in findingproducts.
The core dialog engine is easily adaptable to otherdomains.1.
INTRODUCTIONNatural language dialog has been used in many areas, such asfor call-center/routing application (Carpenter & Chu-Carroll1998), email routing (Walker, Fromer & Narayanan 1998),information retrieval and database access (Androutsopoulos &Ritchie 1995), and for telephony banking (Zadrozny et al 1998).In this demonstration, we present a natural language dialoginterface to online shopping.
Our user studies show naturallanguage dialog to be a very effective means for negotiatinguser's requests and intentions in this domain.2.
SYSTEM ARCHITECTUREIn our system, a presentation manager captures queries fromusers, employs a parser to transform the user's query into alogical form, and sends the logical form to a dialog manager.The presentation manager is also responsible for obtaining thesystem's response from the dialog manager and presenting it tothe user using template-based generation.
The dialog managerformulates action plans for an action manager to perform back-end tasks such as database access, business transactions, etc.
Thedialog manager applies information state-based dialog strategiesto formulate responses depending on the current state, discoursehistory and the action results from the action manager.The Data Management Subsystem maintains a ?concept?repository with common sense ?concepts?
and a phrasal lexiconthat lists possible ways for referring to the concepts.
BusinessRules map concepts to business specifications by definingconcepts using a propositional logic formula of constraints overproduct specifications.
Thus, the Business Rules reflect businessgoals and decisions.
The Extended Database combines productspecifications and precompiled evaluations of the conceptdefinitions for each product to provide a representation thatguides the natural language dialog.
We are investigatingautomated tools for helping developers and maintainers extractrelevant concepts and terms on the basis of user descriptions andqueries about products.3.
EVALUATIONWe conducted several user studies to evaluate the usability ofNLA (Chai et al 2000).
In one study, seventeen test subjectspreferred the dialog-driven navigation of NLA two to one overmenu-driven navigation.
Moreover, with NLA, the averagenumber of clicks was reduced by 63.2% and the average timewas reduced by 33.3%.
Analysis of the user queries (averagelength = 5.31 words long; standard deviation = 2.62; 85% ofinputs are noun phrases) revealed the brevity and relativelinguistic simplicity of user input.
Hence, shallow parsingtechniques were adequate for processing user input.
In general,sophisticated dialog management appears to be more importantthan the ability to handle complex natural language sentences.The user studies also highlighted the need to combine multiplemodalities and styles of interaction.4.
