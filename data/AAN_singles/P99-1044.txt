Syntagmatic and Paradigmatic Representations of Term VariationChr i s t ian  JacqueminLIMSI-CNRSBP 13391403 ORSAY CedexFRANCEj acquemin@limsi, frAbst rac tA two-tier model for the description of morphologi-cal, syntactic and semantic variations of multi-wordterms is presented.
It is applied to term normal-ization of French and English corpora in the medi-cal and agricultural domains.
Five different sourcesof morphological nd semantic knowledge are ex-ploited (MULTEXT, CELEX, AGROVOC, Word-Netl.6, and Microsoft Word97 thesaurus).1 In t roduct ionIn the classical approach to text retrieval, termsare assigned to queries and documents.
The termsare generated by a process called automatic index-ing.
Then, given a query, the similarity between thequery and the documents i  computed and a rankedlist of documents is produced as output of the systemfor information access (Salton and McGill, 1983).The similarity between queries and documents de-pends on the terms they have in common.
Thesame concept can be formulated in many differentways, known as variants, which should be conflatedin order to avoid missing relevant documents.
Forthis purpose, this paper proposes a novel model ofterm variation that integrates linguistic knowledgeand performs accurate term normalization.
It re-lies on previous or ongoing linguistic studies on thistopic (Sparck Jones and Tait, 1984; Jacquemin etal., 1997; Hamon et al, 1998).
Terms are describedin a two-tier framework composed of a paradigmaticlevel and a syntagmatic level that account for thethree linguistic dimensions of term variability (mor-phology, syntax, and semantics).
Term variants areextracted from tagged corpora through FASTR 1, aunification-based transformational parser describedin (Jacquemin et al, 1997).Four experiments are performed on the Frenchand the English languages and a measure of pre-cision is provided for each of them.
Two experi-ments are made on a French corpus \[AGRIC\] com-posed of 1.2 x 106 words of scientific abstracts inI FASTR can be downloadedwww.
limsi, f r/Individu/j acquemi/FASTR.fromthe agricultural domain and two on an English cor-pus \[MEDIC\] composed of 1.3 x 106 words of sci-entific abstracts in the medical domain.
The twoexperiments in the French language are \[AGRIC\] +Word97 and \[AGRIC\] + AGROVOC.
In the for-mer, synonymy links are extracted from the Mi-crosoft Word97 thesaurus; in the latter, seman-tic classes are extracted from the AGROVOC the-saurus, a thesaurus pecialized in the agriculturaldomain (AGROVOC, 1995).
In both experiments,morphological data are produced by a stemming al-gorithm applied to the MULTEXT lexical database(MULTEXT, 1998).
The two experiments on theEnglish language are \[MEDIC\] + WordNet 1.6 or\[MEDIC\] + Word97; they correspond to two differ-ent sources of semantic knowledge.
In both cases,the morphological data are extracted from CELEX(CELEX, 1998).2 Term Var ia t ion :  Representat ionand  Exp lo i ta t ionTerms and variations are represented into two par-allel frameworks illustrated by Figure 1.
Whileterms are described by a unique pair composed ofa structure--at the syntagmatic level--and a set oflexical items--at he paradigmatic level--, a varia-tion is represented by a pair of such pairs: one ofthem is the source term (or normalized term) andthe other one is the target erm (or variant).The syntagmatic description of a term is a con-text free rule; it is complemented with lexical infor-mation embedded in a feature structure denoted byconstraints between paths and values.
For instance,the term speed measurement is represented by:{ Syntagm:{i?-+N2N1} }(N1 lemma) = measurementParadigm: {N2 lemma> = speed(1)This term is a noun phrase composed of a head nounN1 and a modifier N2; the lemmas are given by theconstraints at the paradigmatic level.
This frame-work is similar to the unification-based representa-tion of context-free grammars of (Shieber, 1992).341Term Variation.

.Figure 1: Two level description of terms and variationsAt the syntagmatic level, variations are repre-sented by a source and a target structure.
At theparadigmatic level, the lexical elements of variationsare not instantiated in order to ensure higher gener-ality.
Instead, links between lexical elements are pro-vided.
They denote morphological nd/or semanticrelations between lexical items in the source and tar-get structures of the variation.
For example, thevariation that associates a Noun-Noun term such asthe preceding term speedN= measurementN1 with averbal formof  the head word and a synonym of theargument such as measuringvl maximaIh shorten-ingN velocityN,= is given by:Syntagm:{ (N?
-+ N2 N1) =0" }(V0 --~ V1 (Prep ?
Det ?
(AINIPart)*) N~) (2){ root)=(Vlroot) }Paradigm: {N12sem)=(Ni2sem )If this variation is instantiated with the term givenin (1), it recognizes the lexico-syntactic structureVl (Prep ?
Det ?
(AINIPart)*) N~ (3)in which V1 and measurement are morphologicallyrelated, and N~ and speed are semantically related.The target structure is under-specified in order todescribe several possible instantiations with a singleexpression and is therefore called a candidate varia-tion.
In this example, a regular expression is used tounder-specify the structure2; another solution wouldbe to use quasi-trees with extended ependencies(Vijay-Shanker, 1992).3 Paradigmatic relationsAs illustrated by Figure 2 and Formula (2), there aretwo types of paradigmatic relations between lemmas2A stands for adjective, N for noun, Prep for preposition,V for verb, Det for determiner, Part for participle, and Advfor adverb.involved in the definition of term variations: mor-phological and semantic relations.
The morphologi-cal family of a lemma l is denoted by the set FM(l)and its semantic family by the set FSL (l) or Fsc (l).Semantic family/~-~velocityMorphological family Semantic familyFigure 2: Paradigmatic links between lemmasRoughly speaking, two words are morpho log i -cal ly re la ted  if and only if they share the same root.In the preceding example, to measure and measure-ment are in the same morphological family becausetheir common root is to measure.
Let / :  be the set oflemmas, morphological roots define a binary relationM from ?
to / :  that associates each lemma with itsroot(s): M E ?
~ ?.
M is not a function becausecompound lemmas have more than one root.The morphological family FM(l) of alemma 1 is the set of lemmas (including l)which share a common root with l:Vle f~, FM (l) = {l' E /Z * 3r E /:, (/, r) E MA(/',r) E M} = M- I (M({ I} ) )(4)342(liD(/:) is the power-set of ?

)There are principally two types of semantic re-lations: direct links through a binary relation SL E/2 ~ ?
: or classes C E ~(l?
(/:)).In the case of semantic links, the semanticfamily Fs~ (l) of a lemma 1 is the set oflemmas (including l) which are linked to l:FSL ?
IP(E)Vl E ~, FSL (l) = {l' ?
f~ * (l, Y) ?
SL} tJ {l} (5)= u {l}In the case of semantic lasses, the seman-tic family Fsc (l) of a lemma l is the unionof all the classes to which it belongs:(6) VleL ,  Fsc ( l )=  U c U( l}(c~c)^(tec)Links and classes are equivalent, the choice ofeither model depends on the type of available se-mantic data.
In the experiments reported here, di-rect links are used to represent data extracted fromthe word processor Microsoft Word97 because theyare provided as lists of synonyms associated witheach lemma.
Conversely, the synsets extracted fromWordNet 1.6 (Fellbaum, 1998) are classes of disam-biguated lemmas and, therefore, correspond to thesecond technique.With respect to the definitions of semanticand morphological families given in this section,the candidate variant (3) is such that V1 ?FM(measurement) and N~ ?
FSL(speed) or N~ ?Fsc (speed).4 Morpho log ica l  and Semant icFami l iesIn the experiments on the English corpora, theCELEX database is used to calculate morphologi-cal families.
As for semantic families, either Word-Net 1.6 or the thesaurus of Microsoft Word97 areused.Morphological  Links from CELEXIn the CELEX morphological database (CELEX,1998), each lemma is associated with a morpholog-ical structure that contains one or more root lem-mas.
These roots are used to calculate morpholog-ical families according to Formula (4).
For exam-ple, the morphological family FM(measurementN)of the lemmas with measurev as root word is{ commensurable A , commensurably Adv , countermea-sureN, immeasurableA, immeasurablyAdv, incom-mensurableA, measurableA, measurablyAdv, mea-sureN , measureless A , measurementN , mensurable A ,tape-measureN, yard-measureN , measurev }.Semantic Classes from WordNetTwo sources of semantic knowledge are used forthe English language: the WordNet 1.6 thesaurusand the thesaurus of the word processor MicrosoftWord97.
In the WordNet thesaurus, disambiguatedwords are grouped into sets of synonyms--calledsynsets--that can be used for a class-based ap-proach to semantic relations.
For example, each ofthe five disambiguated meanings of the polysemousnoun speed belongs to a different synset.
In ourapproach, words are not disambiguated and, there-fore, the semantic family of speed is calculated asthe union of the synsets in which one of its senses isincluded.
Through Formula (6), the semantic fam-ily of speed based on WordNet is: Fsc (speedN) ={speedN, speedingN, hurryingN, hasteningN, swift-nessN, fastnessN, velocityN, amphetamineN }.Semantic Links from Microsoft Word97For assisting document edition, the word proces-sor Microsoft Word97 has a command that returnsthe synonyms of a selected word.
We have usedthis facility to build lists of synonyms.
For exam-ple, FSn ( speed N ) = { speedN , swi\]tnesss, velocityN ,quicknessN , rapidityN , accelerationN , alacrityN ,celerityN} (Formula (5)).
Eight other synonyms ofthe word speed are provided by Word97, but they arenot included in this semantic family because they arenot categorized as nouns in CELEX.5 Var ia t ionsThe linguistic transformations for the English lan-guage presented in this section are somehow simpli-fied for the sake of conciseness.
First, we focus onbinary terms that represent 91.3% of the occurrencesof multi-word terms in the English corpus \[MEDIC\].Then, simplifications in the combinations of typesof variations are motivated by corpus explorationsin order to focus on the most productive families ofvariations.The 3 Dimensions of Linguistic VariationsThere are as many types of morphological  re-lations as pairs of syntactic categories of contentwords.
Since the syntactic categories of contentwords are noun (N), verb (V), adjective (A), andadverb (Adv), there are potentially sixteen differentpairs of morphological links.
(Associations of iden-tical categories must be taken into consideration.For example, Noun-Noun associations correspond tomorphological links between substantive nouns suchas agent/process: promoter~promotion.)
Morpho-logical relations are further divided into simple re-lations if they associate two words in the same po-sition and crossed relations if they associate a headword and an argument.
Combining categories andpositions, there are, in all, 64 different ypes of mor-phological relations.343In (Hamon et al, 1998), three types of semanticrelations are studied: a link between the two headwords, a link between the two arguments, or twoparallel inks between heads and arguments.
Theseauthors report that double links are rare and thattheir quality is low.
They only represent 5% of thesemantic variations on a French corpus and they areextracted with a precision of 9% only.
We will there-fore focus on single semantic links.
Since we are onlyconcerned with synonyms, only two types of seman-tic links are studied: synonymous heads or synony-mous arguments.The last dimension of term variability is thestructural transformation at the syntagmaticlevel.
The source structure of the variation mustmatch a term structure.
There are basically twostructures of binary terms: X1 N2 compounds inwhich X1 is a noun, an adjective or a participle, andN1 Prep N~ terms.
According to (Jacquemin et al,1997), there are three types of syntactic variationsin French: coordinations (Coot), insertions of mod-ifiers (Modif), and compounding/decompounding(Comp).
Each of these syntactic variations is fur-ther subdivided into finer categories.Multi-dimensional Linguistic VariationsThe overall picture of term variations is obtained bycombining the 64 types of morphological relations,the two types of semantic relations and the threetypes of syntactic variations (and their sub-types).There are different constraints on these combina-tions that limit the number of possible variations:1.
Morphological and semantic links must operateon different words.
For example, if the headword is transformed by a morphological link,the only word available for a semantic link isthe argument word.2.
The target syntactic structure must be com-patible with the morphological transformations.For example, if a noun is transformed intoa verb, the target structure must be a verbphrase.These two constraints influence the way in whicha variation can be defined by combining differenttypes of elementary modifications.
Firstly, lexicalrelations are defined at the paradigmatic level: mor-phological inks, semantic links or identical words.Then a syntactic structure that is compatible withthe categories of the target words is chosen.The list of variations used for binary compoundterms in English is given in Table 1.
3 It has beenexperimentally refined through a progressive corpus-based tuning.
The Synt  column gives the targetsyntactic structure.
The Morph  column describes3punctuations are noted Pu and coordinating conjunctionCC.the morphological link: a source and a target syn-tactic category and the syntactic positions of thesource and target lemmas.
The Sere column indi-cates whether the variation involves a semantic linkand the position of the lemmas concerned by the link(both lemmas must have an identical position).
ThePattern column gives the target syntactic structureas a function of the source structure which is eitherX1N2, A1N2, or N1N2.For example, Variation #42 transforms anAdjective-Noun term A1 N2 intoN1 ((CC Det?)
?
Prep Det ?
(AIN\[Part) ?-a) N~N1 is a noun in the morphological family of A1(noted FM(A1)N) and N~ is semantically relatedwith N2 (noted Fs(N2)).
This variation recognizesmalignancy in orbital turnouts as a variant of malig-nant tumor because malignancy and malignant aremorphologically related, turnout and tumor are se-mantically related, and malignancyN inprep orbitaIAtumoursN matches the target pattern.
Variation#56 is a more elaborated version of variation (2)given in Section 2.Sample Syntactico-semantic Variants from\ [MEDIC\]The first 36 variations in Table 1 do not containany morphological link.
They are built as follows.Firstly, the different structures of noun phrases areused as target structures.
Twelve structures are pro-posed: head coordination (#1), argument coordina-tion (#4), enumeration with conjunction (#7), enu-meration without conjunction (#10), etc.Then each transformation is enriched with ad-ditional semantic links between the head wordsor between the argument words.
Semantic linksbetween argument words are found in variations#(3n + 2)o<n<ll and between head words in vari-ations #(3n)l<n<12.
(Due to the lack of space, onlyvariations #2 and #3 constructed on top of vari-ation #1 are shown in Table 1.)
Sample variantsfrom \[MEDIC\] for the first 36 variations are givenin Table 2.
Some variations have not matched anyvariant in the whole corpus.Sample Morpho-syntactico-semanticVariantsMorpho-syntactico-semantic variations are num-bered #37 to #62 in Table 1.
Only 10 of the 64possible morphological ssociations are found in thelist of morphological links: Noun to Adjective onarguments (#37), Adjective to Noun on arguments(#39), etc.
Each of these variations is doubled byadding a semantic link between the words that arenot morphologically related.
For example, variation(#40) is deduced from variation (#39) by addinga semantic link between the head words.
Samplevariants are given in Table 3.344Table 1: Patterns of semantic variation for terms of structure X1 N~.# Synt.

First, we calculate precision rates through amanual scanning of the variants.
Secondly, we eval-uate the numbers of variations extracted through thefour experiments.P rec i s ionBecause of the large volumes of data, only experi-ments on the French corpus are evaluated.
\[AGRIC\]+ AGROVOC produces 2,739 variations and 2,485of them are selected as correct.
Since the numberof synonym links proposed by Word97 is higher, thenumber of variants produced by \[AGRIC\] + Word97is higher: 3,860.
3,110 of them are accepted afterhuman inspection.The two experiments produce the same set of non-semantic variants (syntactic and morpho-syntacticvariants).
Associated values of precision are re-ported in Tables 4 and 5.
The semantic variationsare divided into two subsets: "pure" semantic vari-ations and semantic variations involving a syntactictransformation and/or a morphological link.
Theirprecisions are given in Tables 6 and 7.As far as precision is concerned, these tables showthat variations are divided into two levels of qual-ity.
On the one hand, syntactic, morpho-syntacticand pure semantic variations are extracted with ahigh level of precision (above 78%, see the "Total"values in Tables 4 to 6).

For instance, former un rdseaucontinu (build a continuous network) is incorrectlyextracted as a variant of formation permanente (con-tinuing education) through a Noun-to-Verb varia-tion with a semantic link between argument words.The verb former and the associated everbal nounformation are two polysemous words.
In formationpermanente, the meaning is related to a human ac-tivity (to train) while, in former un rdseau continu,the meaning is related to a physical construction (tobuild).Despite the relatively poor precision of hybridvariations, the average precision of term conflation ishigh because hybrid variations only represent a smallfraction of term variations (5.4% and 0.9%, see lines'% sem" in Table 8 below).
The average precisionon \[AGRIC\] + Word97 is 79.8% and the averageprecision on \[AGRIC\] + AGROVOC is 91.1%.The exploitation of semantic links extracted fromWordNet in term variant extraction does not sufferfrom the problem of ambiguity pointed out for queryexpansion in (Voorhees, 1998).
The robustness topolysemy is due to the fact that we are dealing withmultiword terms that build restricted linguistic con-The last line of Table 8 shows that variants rep-resent a significant proportion of term occurrences(from 27.3% to 37.3%).
The distribution of thedifferent types of variants depends the semanticdatabase and on the language under study.
Word-Net 1.6 is a productive source of knowledge for theextraction of semantic variants: In the experiment\[MEDIC\] + WordNet, semantic variants represent58.6% of the variants, while they only represent 4.9%of the variants in the \[AGRIC\] + AGROVOC exper-iment.
These values are reported in the line "Tot.Sem" of Table 8.
Such results confirm the relevanceof non-specialized semantic links in the extraction ofspecialized semantic variants (Hamon et al, 1998).7 Conc lus ionThe model proposed in this study offers a simpleand generic framework for the expression of com-plex term variations.
The evaluation proposed atthe end of this paper shows that term variations areextracted with an excellent precision for the threetypes of elementary variations: syntactic, morpho-syntactic and semantic variations.
The best perfor-mance is obtained with WordNet as source of seman-tic knowledge.
Ongoing work on German, Japaneseand Spanish shows that such a transformational andparadigmatic description of term variability appliesto other languages than French and English reportedin this study.AcknowledgementWe would like to thank Jean Royaut@ and XavierPolanco (INIST-CNRS) for their helpful collabora-tion.
