MEANING NEGOTIATION IN DIALOGUEBarbara  LewandowskaUn ivers i ty  o f  Zodz,  Po landFor  the  sake  o f  e f fec t ive  conmmicat ion  o f  man-mach inetype ,  what  seems necessary  i s  to  f ind  means to  dea l  w i thcomplex  language prob lems in  ways that  would  guarantee  i t scor rect  ana lys i s  and synthes is .
Such prob lems can  be  bet terunders tood  when language i s  v iewed not  as  a s ta t i c  p roduct  o fin teract ion  but  as  a dynamic ,  mean ing  produc ing  process  inac t ion .
The impor tance  o f  look ing  a t  ongo ing  conmmicat ion  ino rder  to  ach ieve  a fu l le r  unders tand ing  o f  the  numerous  l ing -u i s t i c  and non l ingu is t i c  dev ices  employed in  the  process  o fhuman communication has been recently emphasized by manyauthors.
(Clark and Clark'68, Hallday an~ Hasan "76, Garfinkel "72,Churchill "78) ?The mean ing  o f  an  u t terance :  can  be  cons idered  to  be acomplex  that  cons is ts  o f  the  semant ic  leve l  a t  the  assumpt iono f  some idea l i za t ion  o f  data ,  the  pragmat ic  leve l ,  e l i c i ted  bythe  context  and represented  as  a set  o f  ru les  o f  language use ,as  we l l  as  the  mater ia l  re fer r ing  to  the  knowledge o f  thewor ld .A cor rect  ana lys i s  o f  language texts  shou ld  make i tposs ib le  to  per fo rm the  c losest  recovery  both  o f  what  was sa idand o f  what  was ta lked  about .
The in fo rmat ion  requ i red  toin terpret  and  reproduce  an  ut terance  i s  not  fu l l y  and  unambig -uous ly  encoded in  the  speech  s igna l ,  but  i s  completed  by themater ia l  conta ined  in  sets  o f  const ra in ts  fami l ia r  to  each  o fthe  in ter locutors .
I f  the  re la t ions  between the  s igna l  and  the'~ - 182 -icontent  correspond to genera l ly  accepted  ru les  ( syntact i c ,semant ic ,  p ra~at ic ) ,  fu r thermore ,  i f  the re la t ions  in tendedby the sender  are  ident i ca l  to  those apprehended by the rece iv -e r ,  the co~nun icat ion  i s  convent iona l  (Al lwood?76).
Conversat -ion ,  and most exp l i c i t l y ,  d ia logue ,  i s  a cont inuous  recover -ing  of  the above re la t ions .
The i ssue  o f  whether  those fac torsare ent i re ly  or  par t ly  ident i ca l  or  d i f fe rent  to  the par t i -c ipants  i s  be ing es tab l i shed  in  the process  o f  the wholein teract ion .
Hence, meaning o f  an u t te rance  i s  not  a constantbut a variable the value of which is negotiated in the courseof interaction.
Applying Ninsky "s terms (~insk~7 "75) whattakes place there is the process of filling in "default"val-ues in prototypes, u~derstood here as hiersrchically organizeddata structures, representing partial but "constant" knowledge,with the variable defaults, empty, prior to the concrete actof perception.
This, in turn, leads either to activatingfamiliar conventional or stereotypical conceptual frames orstimulates instantiating new data structures if the higher"constant" nodes in the structure are replaced.
A number ofman-machine communication systems (FRL-Roberts, Goldstein,KRL - Bobrow, Winograd, Norman, Kay - cf.
Jirk~ "81 for deta-ils) work accord ing  to  s imi la r  schemes,  which makes i t  poss ib -le  fo r  them to inc lude  sets  o f  in fe rence  ru les  in  the i rsystems.In fe rence  ru les  under ly ing  human as we l l  as man-machineco~nmicat ion  can be represented  in  terms of  data  s t ruc turereconf igurat ions  accord ing  to known typo log ica l  c r i te r ia  suchas hyponymy, quant i f i ca t ion ,  de le t ions ,  add i t ions ,  e tc .
Suchchanges can be perce ived  as opaque by par t i c ipants  due to thelack of transparency in the linguistic form of the utterance.Another problem in this connection is that even in the simpl-est forms of dialogue, question answering, the chain maxim,i.e.
respondlng with a direct answer to the question, is- 183  -s t r i c t ly  fo l lowed in  only a smal l  percentage of cases (12 -24 % of oases - Church i l l  op.
