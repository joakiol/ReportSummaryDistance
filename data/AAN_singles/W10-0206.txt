As afirst step towards fully automatic inference ofcause-emotion correlation, we propose a text-driven, rule-based approach to emotion causedetection in this paper.
First of all, a Chineseemotion cause annotated corpus is constructedbased on our proposed annotation scheme.
Byanalyzing the corpus data, we identify sevengroups of linguistic cues and generalize twosets of linguistic rules for detection of emotioncauses.
With the linguistic rules, we then de-velop a rule-based system for emotion causedetection.
In addition, we propose an evaluationscheme with two phases for performance as-sessment.
Experiments show that our systemachieves a promising performance for cause oc-currence detection as well as cause event detec-tion.
The current study should lay the groundfor future research on the inferences of implicitinformation and the discovery of new informa-tion based on cause-event relation.1 IntroductionText-based emotion processing has attracted plentyof attention in NLP.
Most research has focused onthe emotion detection and classification byidentifying the emotion types, for instanceshappiness and sadness, for a given sentence ordocument (Alm 2005, Mihalcea and Liu 2006,Tokuhisa et al 2008).
However, on top of thissurface level information, deeper level informationregarding emotions, such as the experiencer, cause,and result of an emotion, needs to be extracted andanalyzed for real world applications (Alm 2009).In this paper, we aim at mining one of the crucialdeep level types of information, i.e.
emotion cause,which provides useful information for applicationsranging from economic forecasting, public opinionmining, to product design.
Emotion cause detectionis a new research area in emotion processing.
Inemotion processing, the cause event and emotioncorrelation is a fertile ground for extraction andentailment of new information.
As a first steptowards fully automatic inference of cause-emotion correlation, we propose a text-driven,rule-based approach to emotion cause detection inthis paper.Most theories of emotion treat recognition ofa triggering cause event as an integral part ofemotional experience (Descartes 1649, James 1884,Plutchik 1962, Wierzbicka 1999).
In this study,cause events refer to the explicitly expressedarguments or events that evoke the presence of thecorresponding emotions.
They are usuallyexpressed by means of propositions,nominalizations, and nominals.
For example, ?theylike it?
is the cause event of the emotion happinessin the sentence ?I was very happy that they like it?.Note that we only take into account emotions thatare explicitly expressed, which are usuallypresented by emotion keywords, e.g.
?Thissurprises me?.
Implicit emotions that requireinference or connotation are not processed in thisfirst study.
In this study, we first build a Chineseemotion cause annotated corpus with five primaryemotions, i.e.
happiness, sadness, anger, fear, andsurprise.
We then examine various linguistic cueswhich help detect emotion cause events: theposition of cause event and experiencer relative tothe emotion keyword, causative verbs (e.g.
rang4?to cause?
), action verbs (e.g.
xiang3dao4 ?to thinkabout?
), epistemic markers (e.g.
kan4jian4 ?tosee?
), conjunctions (e.g.
yin1wei4 ?because?
), andprepositions (e.g.
dui4yu2 ?for?).
With the help of45these cues, a list of linguistic rules is generalized.Based on the linguistic rules, we develop a rule-based system for emotion cause detection.Experiments show that such a rule-based systemperforms promisingly well.
We believe that thecurrent study should lay the ground for futureresearch on inferences and discovery of newinformation based on cause-event relation, such asdetection of implicit emotion or cause, as well asprediction of public opinion based on cause events,etc.The paper is organized as follows.
Section 2discusses the related work on various aspects ofemotion analysis.
Section 3 describes the construc-tion of the emotion cause corpus.
Section 4presents our rule-based system for emotion causedetection.
Section 5 describes its evaluation andperformance.
Section 6 highlights our main contri-butions.2 Previous WorkWe discuss previous studies on emotion analysis inthis section, and underline fundamental yet unre-solved issues.
We survey the previous attempts ontextual emotion processing and how the presentstudy differs.2.1 Emotion ClassesVarious approaches to emotion classification wereproposed in different fields, such as philosophy(Spinoza 1675, James 1884), biology (Darwin1859, linguistics (Wierzbicka 1999, K?vecses2000), neuropsychology (Plutchik 1962, Turner1996), and computer science (Ortony et al 1988,Picard 1995), as well as varying from language tolanguage.
Although there is lack of agreementamong different theories on emotion classification,a small number of primary emotions are commonlyassumed.
Other emotions are secondary emotionswhich are the mixtures of the primary emotions.Researchers have attempted to propose the listof primary emotions, varying from two to ten basicemotions (Ekman 1984, Plutchik 1980, Turner2000).
Fear and anger appear on every list, whe-reas happiness and sadness appear on most of thelists.
These four emotions, i.e.
fear, anger, happi-ness, and sadness, are the most common primaryemotions.
Other less common primary emotionsare surprise, disgust, shame, distress, guilt, interest,pain, and acceptance.In this study, we adopt Turner?s emotion clas-sification (2000), which identifies five primaryemotions, namely happiness, sadness, fear, anger,and surprise.
Turner?s list consists of primary emo-tions agreed upon by most previous work.2.2 Emotion Processing in TextTextual emotion processing is still in its early stag-es in NLP.
Most of the previous works focus onemotion classification given a known emotion con-text such as a sentence or a document using eitherrule-based (Masum et al 2007, Chaumartin 2007)or statistical approaches (Mihalcea and Liu 2005,Kozareva et al 2007).
However, the performanceis far from satisfactory.
What is more, many basicissues remain unresolved, for instances, the rela-tionships among emotions, emotion type selection,etc.
Tokuhisa et al (2008) was the first to exploreboth the issues of emotion detection and classifica-tion.
It created a Japanese emotion-provokingevent corpus for an emotion classification task us-ing an unsupervised approach.
However, only49.4% of cases were correctly labeled.
Chen et al(2009) developed two cognitive-based Chineseemotion corpora using a semi-unsupervised ap-proach, i.e.
an emotion-sentence (sentences con-taining emotions) corpus and a neutral-sentence(sentences containing no emotion) corpus.
Theyshowed that studies based on the emotion-sentencecorpus (~70%) outperform previous corpora.Little research, if not none, has been done toexamine the interactions between emotions and thecorresponding cause events, which may make agreat step towards an effective emotion classifica-tion model.
The lack of research on cause eventsrestricted current emotion analysis to simple classi-ficatory work without exploring the potentials ofthe rich applications of putting emotion ?in con-text?.
In fact, emotions can be invoked by percep-tions of external events and in turn triggerreactions.
The ability to detect implicit invokingcauses as well as predict actual reactions will addrich dimensions to emotion analysis and lead tofurther research on event computing.3 Emotion Cause CorpusThis section briefly describes how the emotioncause corpus is constructed.
We first explain what46an emotion cause is and discuss how emotioncause is linguistically expressed in Chinese.
Wethen describe the corpus data and the annotationscheme.
For more detailed discussion on the con-struction of the emotion cause corpus, please referto Lee et al (2010).3.1 Cause EventsFollowing Talmy (2000), the cause of an emotionshould be an event itself.
In this work, it is called acause event.
By cause event, we do not necessarilymean the actual trigger of the emotion or whatleads to the emotion.
Rather, it refers to the imme-diate cause of the emotion, which can be the actualtrigger event or the perception of the trigger event.Adapting TimeML annotation scheme (Saur?
et al2004), events refer to situations that happen or oc-cur.
In this study, cause events specifically refer tothe explicitly expressed arguments or events thatare highly linked with the presence of the corres-ponding emotions.
In Lee et al?s (2010) corpus,cause events are categorized into two types: verbalevents and nominal events.
Verbal events refer toevents that involve verbs (i.e.
propositions andnominalizations), whereas nominal events aresimply nouns (i.e.
nominals).
Some examples ofcause event types are given in bold face in (1)-(6).

?The causes in (1) and (2) are propositional causes,which indicate the actual events involved in caus-ing the emotions.
The ones in (3) and (4) are no-minalized causes, whereas (5) and (6) involvenominal causes3.2 Corpus Data and Annotation SchemeBased on the list of 91 Chinese primary emotionkeywords identified in Chen et al (2009), we ex-tract 6,058 instances of sentences by keywordmatching from the Sinica Corpus 1 , which is atagged balanced corpus of Mandarin Chinese con-taining a total of ten million words.
Each instancecontains the focus sentence with the emotion key-word ?<FocusSentence>?
plus the sentence before?<PrefixSentence>?
and after ?<SuffixSentence>?it.
The extracted instances include all primary emo-tion keywords occurring in the Sinica Corpus ex-cept for the emotion class happiness, as thekeywords of happiness exceptionally outnumberother emotion classes.
In order to balance thenumber of each emotion class, we set the upperlimit at about 1,600 instances for each primaryemotion.Note that the presence of emotion keywordsdoes not necessarily convey emotional informationdue to different possible reasons such as negativepolarity and sense ambiguity.
Hence, by manualinspection, we remove instances that 1) are non-emotional; 2) contain highly ambiguous emotionkeywords, such as ru2yi4 ?wish-fulfilled?, hai4xiu1?to be shy?, wei2nan2 ?to feel awkward?, from thecorpus.
After the removal, the remaining instancesin the emotion cause corpus is 5,629.
Among theremaining instances, we also remove the emotionkeywords in which the instances do not expressthat particular emotion and yet are emotional.
Thetotal emotion keywords in the corpus is 5,958.For each emotional instance, two annotatorsmanually annotate cause events of each keyword.Since more than one emotion can be present in an1http://dbo.sinica.edu.tw/SinicaCorpus/47instance, the emotion keywords are tagged as<emotionword id=0>, <emotionword id=1>, andso on.573 Y 0/shang1 xin1/Sadness<PrefixSentence> ma1ma ye3 wen4 le ling2 ju1, dan4 shi4mei2 you3 ren4 jian4 dao4 xiao3 bai2.

</SuffixSentence>Figure 1: An Example of Cause Event AnnotationFigure 1 shows an example of annotated emotionalsentences in corpus, presented as pinyin with tones,followed by an English translation.
For an emotionkeyword tagged as <id=0>, [*01n] marks the be-ginning of its cause event while [*02n] marks theend.
The ?0?
shows which index of emotion key-word it refers to, ?1?
marks the beginning of thecause event, ?2?
marks the end, and ?n?
indicatesthat the cause is a nominal event.
For an emotionkeyword tagged as <id=1>, [*11e] marks the be-ginning of the cause event while [*12e] marks theend, in which ?e?
refers to a verbal event, i.e.
ei-ther a proposition or a nominalization.
An emotionkeyword can sometimes be associated with morethan one cause, in which case both causes aremarked.
The emotional sentences containing noexplicitly expressed cause event remain as they are.The actual number of extracted instances ofeach emotion class to be analyzed, the positiveemotional instances, and the instances with causeevents are presented in Table 1.Table 1: Summary of Corpus DataEmotions No.
of Instances Extracted Emotional With CausesHappiness 1,644 1,327 1,132 (85%)Sadness 901 616 468 (76%)Fear 897 689 567 (82%)Anger 1,175 847 629 (74%)Surprise 1,341 781 664 (85%)Total 5,958 4,260 (72%) 3,460 (81%)We can see that 72% of the extracted instances ex-press emotions, and 81% of the emotional in-stances have a cause.
The corpus containshappiness (1,327) instances the most and sadness(616) the least.
For each emotion type, about 81%of the emotional sentences, on average, are consi-dered as containing a cause event, with surprisethe highest (85%) and anger the lowest (73%).This indicates that an emotion mostly occurs withthe cause event explicitly expressed in the text,which confirms the prominent role of cause eventsin expressing an emotion.4 A Rule-based System for Cause Detec-tion4.1 Linguistic Analysis of Emotion CausesBy analyzing the corpus data, we examine thecorrelations between emotions and cause events interms of various linguistic cues: the position ofcause event, verbs, epistemic markers,conjunctions, and prepositions.
We hypothesizethat these cues will facilitate the detection ofemotion cause events.First, we calculate the distribution of causeevent types of each emotion as well as the positionof cause events relative to emotion keywords andexperiencers.
The total number of emotionalinstances regarding each emotion is given in Table2.Table 2: Cause Event Position of Each EmotionEmotions Cause Type (%) Cause Position (%)Event Nominal Left RightHappiness 76 6 74 29Sadness 67 8 80 20Fear 68 13 52 48Anger 55 18 71 26Surprise 73 12 59 41Table 2 suggests that emotion cause events tend tobe expressed by verbal events than nominal eventsand that cause events tend to occur at the positionto the left of the emotion keyword, with fear (52%)being no preference.
This may be attributed to thefact that fear can be triggered by either factive orpotential causes, which is rare for other primaryemotions.
For fear, factive causes tend to take theleft position whereas potential causes tend to takethe right position.48Second, we identify seven groups oflinguistic cues that are highly collocated withcause events (Lee et al 2010), as shown in Table 3.Table 3: Seven Groups of Linguistic CuesGroup Cue WordsI ?to cause?
: rang4, ling4, shi3II ?to think about?

: neng2Group I includes three common causative verbs,and Group II a list of verbs of thinking and talking.Group III is a list of say verbs.
Group IV includesfour types of epistemic markers which are usuallyverbs marking the cognitive awareness of emotionin the complement position (Lee and Huang 2009).The epistemic markers include verbs of seeing,hearing, knowing, and existing.
Group V coverssome prepositions which all roughly mean ?for?.Group VI contains the conjunctions that explicitlymark the emotion cause.
Group VII includes otherlinguistic cues that do not fall into any of the sixgroups.
Each group of linguistic cues serves as anindicator marking the cause events in differentstructures of emotional constructions, in whichGroup I specifically marks the end of the causeevents while the other six groups marks thebeginning of the cause events.4.2 Linguistic Rules for Cause DetectionWe examine 100 emotional sentences of each emo-tion keyword randomly extracted from the devel-opment data, and generalize some rules foridentifying the cause of the corresponding emotionverb (Lee 2010).
The cause is considered as aproposition.
It is generally assumed that a proposi-tion has a verb which optionally takes a noun oc-curring before it as the subject and a noun after itas the object.
However, a cause can also be ex-pressed as a nominal.
In other words, both the pre-dicate and the two arguments are optional providedthat at least one of them is present.We also manually identify the position of theexperiencer as well as the linguistic cues discussedin Section 4.1.
All these components may occur inthe clause containing the emotion verb (focusclause), the clause before the focus clause, or theclause after the focus clause.
The abbreviationsused in the rules are given as follows:C = Cause eventE = ExperiencerK = Keyword/emotion verbB = Clause before the focus clauseF = Focus clause/the clause containing the emotion verbA = Clause after the focus clauseFor illustration, an example of the rule descriptionis given in Rule 1.Rule 1:i) C(B/F) + I(F) + E(F) + K(F)ii) E = the nearest Na/Nb/Nc/Nh after I in Fiii) C = the nearest (N)+(V)+(N) before I in F/BRule 1 indicates that the experiencer (E) appears tobe the nearest Na (common noun)/ Nb (propernoun)/ Nc (place noun)/ Nh (pronoun) after GroupI cue words in the focus clause (F), while, at thesame time, it comes before the keyword (K).
Be-sides, the cause (C) comes before Group I cuewords.
We simplify the proposition as a structureof (N)+(V)+(N), which is very likely to contain thecause event.
Theoretically, in identifying C, weshould first look for the nearest verb occurring be-fore Group I cue words in the focus sentence (F) orthe clause before the focus clause (B), and considerthis verb as an anchor.
From this verb, we search tothe left for the nearest noun, and consider it as thesubject; we then search to the right for the nearestnoun until the presence of the cue words, and con-sider it as the object.
The detected subject, verb,and object form the cause event.
In most cases, theexperiencer is covertly expressed.
It is, however,difficult to detect such causes in practice as causesmay contain no verbs, and the two arguments areoptional.
Therefore, we take the clause instead ofthe structure of (N)+(V)+(N) as the actual cause.Examples are given in (7) and (8).
For both sen-tences, the clause that comes before the cue wordis taken as the cause event of the emotion in ques-tion.49(7) [C yi1 la1 ke4 xi4 jun1 wu3 qi4 de bao4 guang1], [Ishi3] [E lian2 he2 guo2 da4 wei2][K zhen4 jing1] .?

?Table 4 summarizes the generalized rules for de-tecting the cause events of the five primary emo-tions in Chinese.
We identify two sets of rules: 1)the specific rules that apply to all emotional in-stances (i.e.
rules 1-13); 2) the general rules thatapply to the emotional instances in which causesare not found after applying the specific set ofrules (i.e.
rules 14 and 15).Table 4: Linguistic Rules for Cause DetectionNo.

For instances, in Rule 1, the emotionkeyword cannot be followed by the words de ?pos-session?/ deshi4 ?is that?/ shi4 ?is?
since it is verylikely to have the cause event occurring after suchwords; in Rule 2, the cue word in III yuo3 ?to ex-ist?
is excluded as it causes noises; whereas forRule 4, it only applies to instances containingkeywords of happiness, fear, and surprise.5 Experiment5.1 Evaluation MetricsAn evaluation scheme is designed to assess theability to extract the cause of an emotion in context.We specifically look into two phases of the per-formance of such a cause recognition system.Phase 1 assesses the detection of an emotion co-occurrence with a cause; Phrase 2 evaluates therecognition of the cause texts for an emotion.Overall Evaluation:The definitions of related metrics are presented inFigure 2.
For each emotion in a sentence, if neitherthe gold-standard file nor the system file has acause, both precision and recall score 1; otherwise,precision and recall are calculated by the scoringmethod ScoreForTwoListOfCauses.
As an emotionmay have more than one cause, ScoreForTwoLis-tOfCauses calculates the overlap scores betweentwo lists of cause texts.
Since emotion cause rec-ognition is rather complicated, two relaxed stringmatch scoring methods are selected to comparetwo cause texts, ScoreForTwoStrings: RelaxedMatch 1 uses the minimal overlap between thegold-standard cause and the system cause.
The sys-tem cause is considered as correct provided thatthere is at least one overlapping Chinese character;Relaxed Match 2 is more rigid which takes intoaccount the overlap text length during scoring.50Phase 1: The Detection of Cause OccurrenceThe detection of cause occurrence is considered apreliminary task for emotion cause recognition andis compounded by the fact that neutral sentencesare difficult to detect, as observed in Tokuhisa et al(2008).
For Phase 1, each emotion keyword in asentence has a binary tag: Y (i.e.
with a cause) orN (without a cause).
Similar to other NLP tasks,we adopt the common evaluation metrics, i.e.
accu-racy, precision, recall, and F score.Phase 2: The Detection of CausesThe evaluation in Phase 2 is limited to the emotionkeywords with a cause either in the gold-standardfile or in the system file.
The performance is calcu-lated as in Overall Evaluation scheme.5.2 Results and DiscussionWe use 80% sentences as the development data,and 20% as the test data.
The baseline is designedas follows: find a verb to the left of the keyword inquestion, and consider the clause containing theverb as a cause.Table 5 shows the performances of the overallevaluation.
We find that the overall performancesof our system have significantly improved usingRelaxed Match 1 and Relaxed Match 2 by 19%and 19% respectively.
Although the overall per-formance of our system (47.95% F-score for Re-laxed Match 1 and 41.67% for Relaxed Match 2) isnot yet very high, it marks a good start for emotionOverall evaluation formula:Precision (GF, SF) =ScoreForTwoListOfCauses ( , )1j jjji ii iS GF em SS SF em SSCList GCList?????

Ta-ble 6 shows the overall accuracy, and Table 7shows the detailed performances.
In Table 6, wefind that our system and the baseline have similarhigh accuracy scores.
Yet Table 7 shows that bothsystems achieve a high performance for emotionswith a cause, but much worse for emotions withouta cause.
It is important to note that even though thenaive baseline system has comparably high per-formance with our rule-based system in judgingwhether there is a cause in context, this result isbiased by two facts.
First, as the corpus containsmore than 80% of sentences with emotion, a sys-tem which is biased toward detecting a cause, suchas the baseline system, naturally performs well.
Inaddition, once the actual cause is examined, we cansee that the baseline actually detects a lot of falsepositives in the sense that the cause it identifies isonly correct in 4.39%.
Our rule-based systemshows great promise in being able to deal withneutral sentences effectively and being able todetect the correct cause at least three times moreoften than the baseline.Table 8 shows the performances in Phase 2.Comparing to the baseline, we find that our rulesimprove the performance of cause recognition us-ing Relaxed Match 1 and 2 scoring by 21% and21% respectively.
On the one hand, the 7% gap inF-score between Relaxed Match 1 and 2 also indi-cates that our rules can effectively locate the clauseof a cause.
On the other hand, the rather low per-formances of the baseline show that most causesrecognized by the baseline are wrong although thebaseline effectively detects the cause occurrence,as indicated in Table 7.
In addition, we check theaccuracy (precision) and contribution (recall) ofeach rule.
In descending order, the top four accu-rate rules are: Rules 7, 10, 11, and 1; and the topfour contributive rules are: Rules 2, 15, 14, and 3.6 ConclusionEmotion processing has been a great challenge inNLP.
Given the fact that an emotion is often trig-gered by cause events and that cause events areintegral parts of emotion, we propose a linguistic-driven rule-based system for emotion cause detec-tion, which is proven to be effective.
In particular,we construct a Chinese emotion cause corpus an-notated with emotions and the corresponding causeevents.
Since manual detection of cause events islabor-intensive and time-consuming, we intend touse the emotion cause corpus to produce automaticextraction system for emotion cause events withmachine learning methods.
We believe that ourrule-based system is useful for many real worldapplications.
For instance, the information regard-ing causal relations of emotions is important forproduct design, political evaluation, etc.
Such asystem also shed light on emotion processing asthe detected emotion cause events can serve asclues for the identification of implicit emotions.52ReferencesAlm, C. O., D. Roth and R. Sproat.
