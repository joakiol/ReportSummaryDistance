The decisions one makes on thisscore play a crucial role in any model of the interaction involved in ground-ing an utterance.
Integrating the clarificatory potential of an utterance intothe grounding process transforms the issue of content recognition into amore concrete issue: grammatically determined content has markedly dis-tinct clarificatory potential from content determined using domain level in-ference.
This leads to a new challenge: how to integrate the two types ofcontent in such a way that both enables their distinct clarificatory potentialto be maintained and allows content determined by domain level inferenceto feature in grounding.
My talk will address this challenge.36
