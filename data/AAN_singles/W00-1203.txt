Knowledge Extraction for Identification of Chinese Organization NamesKeh-Jiann Chen & Chao-jan Chenkchen@iis.siniea.edu.tw fichard@iis.siniea.edu.twInstitute of  Information Science, Academia Siniea, TaipeiABSTRACTIn this paper, a knowledge extraction processwas proposed to extract the knowledge foridentifying Chinese organization ames.
Theknowledge extraction process utilizes thestructure property, statistical property as well aspartial inguistic knowledge of the organizationnames to extract new organizations from domaintexts.
The knowledge xtraction processes wereexperimented on large amount of texts retrievedfrom WWW.
With high standard of thresholdvalues, new organization names can beidentified with very high precision.
Thereforethe knowledge extraction processes can becarried out automatically to self improve theperformance in the future.1.
INTRODUCTIONThe occurrences of unknown words causedifficulties in natural language processing.
Theword set of a natural language is open-ended.There is no way of collecting every words of alanguage, since new words will be created forexpressing new concepts, new inventions,newborn babies, new organizations.
Thereforehow to identify new words in a text will be themost challenging task for natural languageprocessing.
It is especially true for Chinese.Each Chinese morpheme (usually a singlecharacter) carries meanings and most arcpolyscmous.
New words are easily constructedby combining morphemes and their meaningsare the semantic composition of morphemecomponents.
However there are alsosemantically non-compositional compounds,such as proper names.
In Chinese text, there isno blank to mark word boundaries and noinflectional markers nor capitalization markersto denote the syntactic or semantic types of newwords.
Hence the unknown word identificationfor Chinese became one of the most difficult anddemanding research topic.There are many different types ofunknown words and each has different morph-syntactic and morph-scmantic structures.
Inprinciple their syntactic and semantic ategoriescan be determined by their content andcontextual information, but there arc manydifficult problems have to be solved.
First ofall it is not possible to find a uniformrepresentational schema and categorizationalgorithm to handle different types ofunknown words due to their different morph-syntactic structures.
Second, the clues foridentifying different type of unknown wordsare also different.
For instance, identificationof names of Chinese people is very muchrelied on the surnames, which is a limited setof characters.
The statistical methods arecommonly used for identifying proper names(Chen & Lee 1996, Chang ct al.
1994, Sun etal.
1994).
The identification of generalcompounds is more relied on the morphemesand the semantic relations betweenmorphemes (Chcn & Chcn 2000).
The thirddifficulty is the problems of ambiguities,such as structure ambiguities, syntacticambiguities and semantic ambiguities.
Forinstances, usually a morphemecharacter/word has multiple meaning andsyntactic categories and may play the rolesof common words or proper names.Therefore the ambiguity resolution becameone of the major tasks.In this paper we focus our attention onthe identification of the organization names.It is considered to be a hard task to identifyorganization names in comparing with theidentification of other types of unknownwords, because there are not much morph-syntactic and morph-sernantic clues toindicate an organization name.
There is nosignificant preference on the selection ofmorphemes/characters and the semantic ofthe morphemes, which gives no clue leadingtoward the identification.
For instance, '~ ,micro-soW (Microsoft) has the character bycharacter (morpheme by morpheme)translation of 'slightly soR" and there is nomarker, such as capitalization, to indicatethat it is a proper name.
The only reliableclue is its context information.
However anorganization's full names usually occur at itsfirst mention, unless it is a well-knownorganization.
A full name contains its proper15name and organization type, such as '~"~ , Acer Computer-Company'.
Theorganization types became the major clue ofidentifying a new organization name.
Howeverabbreviated shorter names usually will be used,such as a) omit part of the organization type, forinstances '~  ~,  Acer Computer', '~~..~J, Acer Company', b) omit the organizationtype totally, for instance '~ .~,  Acer', or c) theabbreviation, for instance '~ ,  global-electric(Acer-computer)'.
Therefore the task becamenot only the identification of organization namesin different forms but also finding their meaningequivalence classes.
To achieve the above goal,the knowledge of 1) proper names oforganizations, 2) different lines of the businesses,and 3) different organization types, should beequipped.
Unfortunately there is no well-prepared knowledge sources containing theabove information.
Therefore a knowledgeextraction model is proposed to extract theabove mentioned knowledge from the dictionaryand domain texts.2.
STRUCTURES OF ORGANIZATIONNAMESThere is no rigid structure for an organizationname as mentioned in the previous section.Roughly speaking an organization ame iscomposed by two major components.
The firstpart is the proper name and the second part is theorganization type.
The second part contains themajor key words lead toward the identificationof an organization, since the organization types,such as '~ J ,  company', ~ '~"  foundation',"/J',~J~ group', '~ \ [ \ ]  enterprise' etc, tells whatkind of organizations they are.
If it is a company,to be more informative the line of businessusually goes with the key word '~\ ]  company',for instances '~ff~.t..~J food company', ~~ computer company', ' ~ M  ~='~ ~investment consultant company', but in mostcases the keyword '~B\ ]  company' will beignored, such as ~- -~(  President food).Sometimes the line of business and theorganization type go together to become a singleword, such as ,qa~ middle school',  ' f , l~bank' , '~ :  ~ hospital'.
By observing thestructure of the organization name, it seems thatonce a complete list of the organization types iswell prepared, then it is not hard to identify theorganizations by their Rill names.
The onlycomplication is that abbreviated names occurmore frequently than fidl names.
The identifier'.~..~\] company' is usually ignored in real text.The lines of business became the majoridentifier for a company and many business linesare common words, such as '~1~ food','~JJ~ computer', 'TJ~0~ cement'.
Thereforeit is necessary to make the distinctionbetween a common compounds and acompany name, for examples, '~ J~J~nhealth food" vs. ,~m~ President food','~ fg j~ personal computer' vs. ' ~~ Acer computer'.
Although they are two-way ambiguous, usually they have only onepreference r ading.In conclusion, the types and the propernames of organizations will be the majorclues lead toward the identification of theorganizations.
In addition, it is also better tohave a list of well known organizationnames, such that the well known companynames, like '~.~i \ [  MicrosoR', can beidentified immediately.
Most of theknowledge preparation works should bedone by oflline approaches.
The preparedknowledge would be utilized to onlineidentification of newly coined organiT~ations.The equivalent classes of the well-knownorganizations are also classified by asimilarity-based approach.3.
KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTIONThere are two knowledge sources.
One is theCKIP Chinese lexicon and another is theChinese text from WWW.
The lexiconprovides a partial list of importantorganizations and the information extractedfrom them will be the initial knowledge ofthe identification system.
The texts fromWWW provide ample of new organizationnames implicitly.
The problem is how toextract some, if not all, of them from thetexts.
Once we have a list of organizationnames.
The proper names for organizationsand the organization types will be extractedby analyzing the morphological structures ofthe organization names.
However aneffective morphological analyzer dependsupon the availability of the knowledge of theorganization types, but the lists of theorganization types are not available yet.As we mentioned before the completeorganization names have two parts.
The firstpart is the proper name and the second partis the organization type.
The number ofdifferent proper names is unlimited and onthe other hand the number of differentorganization types is limited.
Th/s propertywill be utilized to separate the variable parts,i.e.
the proper name, and the constant parts,i.e.
the organization type, from theorganization names.16The numbers of organization names in thelexicon is very limited, since only the importantorganizations in the common domain will becollected.
Therefore the initial knowledgeextracted from lexicon is also very limited.
Tomake the sources of knowledge more adequate,vast amount of new organization names houldbe extracted from each different domain corpus.Unfortunately none of the existing corpora hadtagged the organization names.
Therefore we aregoing to design a semi-automatic method toextract the high frequency organization namesfrom text corpora.The locality of occurrences of keywords in atext will be utilized for keyword extraction.Once an organization name occun-ing in a text itis very probably reoccurred in the same text.
Therecurrence property had been utilized to extractkeywords or key-phrases from text (Chien 1999,Fung 1998, Smadja 1993).
However not allkeywords arc organization names.
Theknowledge extracted from the lexicon, i.e.
thelist of the organization types will be the initialknowledge for identifying organization names.In addition to the initial knowledge, the structureproperty of the organization names will be alsoutilized in classifying extracted keywords intoorganization names and non-organization names.The extraction processes will be repeated forextracting new organizations and thereforeextracting new organization types.
The moreknowledge would have been extracted the moreaccurate of the organization identification willachieve.3.1 Morphological Analysis for OrganizationNamesThere are 1391 number of words in the CKIPlexicon classified as organizations.
Table Ishows some of the examples.Table I.
The samples of organizations from theCKIP  dictionaryAs we observed, the morphological structure ofan organization name usually is a compoundingof a proper name and a organization type.
Theorganization type might be a compounding of aline of business and a type, for instances i.~JJ~~..~J (computer company), ~\]~,~(bank), qb~(middle school), or simply a line of business,for instances AM(food), ~-~J~(computer),7~ ~ (cement).
The proper names arevariables, since each organization type mayhave many different institutions withdifferent names.
The types are constants.There is a limited number of constantsattached with many different proper namesto form different organization names.Therefore to extract the organization types isequivalent o extract the high frequencyending morphemes.
Table 2 shows the top 20high frequency ending morphemes xtractedfrom the 1391 organization ames and indeed they are organization types.52 ~" 38 ~ 36 ~ 30 ~d: 29 ;/q~t21 ~ 21 I~ 20 ~ 17 Y~ 16 ~z16 ~ 16 ~ 15 ~ 15 ~ 15 "l-\]g13 I~ 12 ~ 12 ~\] 12 ~JJ 11Table 2.
The top 20 organization typesranked with their occurrence frequenciesextracted from the 1391 organization names3.2 Automatic Extraction of OrganizationNamesA Web spider can extract ext from eachdifferent domain through WWW.
Thenkeyword extraction technique is applied ondomain texts to retrieve possible keywords.The kcyword set includes organizationnames, personal names, general compounds,and also error extraction.
Most of which arenot organization names.
It is supposed thatthe available list of the organization typeswill be the source of knowledge to identifycandidates oforganizations.
However such amethod only identifies the organizations ofthe known organization types and providesnew proper names only.
It will not identifynew types of organizations.
Therefore weuse a new method to extract the organizationnames by using the structure property oforganization names.Extraction Algorithm for OrganizationTypes:Step 1.
Using a Web spider to collectChinese texts of a fixed domain, such asdomain of finance and business, from.WWW.Step 2.
Extract high frequency keywords inthe text (Smadja 93, Chang & Su 97, Chien99).Step 3.
For the keywords of length 3,4, and 5,each keyword is divided into two parts Xand Y. X is a candidate of proper name and17Y is a candidate of organization type.
The X isthe initial two-characters of the keyword and Yis the remained characters.
(Since most propernames of organizations have two characters, wecan extract he organization types of the lengths1, 2 and 3 from three different groups ofkeywords with lengths 3, 4 and 5 respectively.
)Extract the organization type Y, if for somekeywords X+Y, the following conditions hold.a) X satisfies one of the following cases.1.
X is not in the lexicon, i.e.
X is anunknown word.2.
X has the categories of Nb or No, i.e.
it isa known proper name (bib) or a locationname (No).b) For each Y, assumed to be the organizationtype, there must have more than n number ofdifferent X, such that X+Y in the extractedkeyword list.
In practice, the threshold valuen was set to 2.In general, Chinese company names like mostproper names are non-common word (unknownwords).
However sometimes they are placenames (No), but rarely they are common ouns,adjectives, or verbs.
Therefore in order to avoidtoo many false alarms, such as "~.
,~, /~ supercomputer", to be considered as a company name,the condition a) of step 3 is set.
The reason tosetup the condition b) is that each organizationtype Y should have many different organizationswhich have the same organization type Y, suchas ' ~ ~  Acer computer',  '~,.
"~_,~Leo computer', ' ~ ~ ~ ~ Blue-slcycomputer', ...etc..
The real implementationshows the different hreshold value n gives thedifferent precision and recall for identification.For the first iteration of knowledgeextraction, we suggest to have higher ecall rate.Set the threshold value low and manually selectthe final list of the organization types.
For thefuture automatic knowledge xtraction, in orderto increase the precision of the informationextraction higher threshold values are suggested.4.
E~ERIME~ ~S~TSThe knowledge xtraction processes for Chineseorg~t ion  names are carried out by differentstages.
At the first stage, the words marked withsemantic category of organization were accessedfrom the CKIP dictionary.
There are 1391 wordorganization types.
As mentioned in section 3.1,a pseudo morphological analysis process wascarried out, which try to find the high frequencyending morphemes.
Since the structure of anorganization ame is a composition of X+Y,where X is a proper name and Y is aorganization type.
There are 546 differentending morphemes.
The high frequencyending morphemes are exactly to be themorphemes for common organization types.Many of them are monosyllabic words andthey are polysemous, as shown in Table 1.For the future identification, thedisambiguation process has to be carried outfor those polysemous ending morphemes(Chen & Chen 2000).
The extractedmorphemes and list of organizations will bethe first collection of the organization types.At the second stage, we try to extractnew organizations names from differentdomain text.
Each different domain hasmany new organization types.
For instancein the domain of finance and business, thereare many company names, which havecompletely different word strings for theorganization types as in the extracted list bythe first stage.The algorithm shown in the section 3.2was carried out.
At the step 1, 31787 texts ofnews of the finance and business domainwere extracted from http://www.cnyes.com.At step 2, 40675 keywords were extractedfrom the news corpus.
At step 3,organization ames were identified and theorganization types were extracted.
If thethreshold value n -- 2, 92 types wereextracted and among them 83 are correctorganization types.
The precision is 90%.
Ifthe threshold was set to 3, only 56 typeswere extracted and all of them happen to becorrect.
The precision increased to 100%,but of course the recall rate dropped.
Wedon't know the exact recall rate, since thereare too many keywords in the training set.However the recall rate is not important,since the whole knowledge extractionprocess is a recurrent process.
Theknowledge xtraction procedures should berepeatedly applied on the different set of textand at each iteration more information willbe extracted.
Hence the precision is muchmore important than the recall.
Theknowledge sources for future identificationof organizations are the accumulated lists ofthe organization names, the proper names oforganizations and the organization types.Table 3 contains the extractedorganization types while the threshold valuen=3.
The organization types are classified bytheir lengths and sorted by their frequenciesof uses.
Table 4 contains the extractedorganization types which associated withexactly two different names and the last lineshows the error extractions.
Among newlyextracted organization types only 23 of them18are already in the old list._~t~ 81 ~ 74 ~:~ 46 ~1~'~ 41 ~---~.

During the wordsegmentation process, an organization name iseither identified immediately (if it is a knownorganization name), or it will be segmented intotwo segments of X+Y or several segments of(xl+x2+...+xn)+Y, where X is a proper names,Y is the organization type.
When the propername X is a new word, it will be segmented intoshorter segments (xl+x2+...+xn).
To simplifythe experiment process, we  assume the propernames X are either the words of categories Nb(i.e.
proper names) or Nc (i.e.
the place names)or a two-character unknown word.
For theidentification experiment, a corpus extract froma T.V.
news (http://www.ttv.com.tw)The patterns of X+Y in the testing corpuswere searched.
117 different organizations wereidentified.
Among thern 56 are knownorganizations, i.e.
they are in the organizationname list.
61 of them arc identified by thecomposition of X+Y and 52 of them are correct.It counts the precision of 52/61=85% foridentifying new names.
The total performance isthe precision of 108/I 17=92%.The knowledge-based approach foridentifying organization ames seems verypromising.
It outperforms the reports of theprecision of 61.79% and the recall of54.50% in (Chen & Lee 1996) and theexperiment was carried out under thecondition that the knowledge extractionprocess is in its initial stage.
We expect hatperformance of the algorithm will becomebetter and better while the knowledgeextraction process continuously performs.4.2 Automatic Extraction of NameEquivalent ClassesThe abbreviated names are very frequentlyoccurred in the real text especially in thedomain of the stock market.
By observingthe abbreviation ames, the heuristic rulesfor abbreviating a company name can beconcluded as follows.Abbreviation rule: If the proper name of acompany is unique, then take the propername as its abbreviation name, such as '~ ,Microsoft'.
Otherwise the abbreviation willbe a compound of key-characters from partof its proper name and part of its line ofbusiness, such as ~ is the abbreviationo f '~  m~l~,  China petroleum'.An  experiment was carried out to findthe full names of the abbreviations ofcompany names shown in the price table ofthe Taiwan stock market.
The purposes ofthis experiment are a) to fred the equivalentclasses of company names and b) to havesome idea about the recall rate of the currentknowledge extraction process.The matching process between theabbreviations and the extracted organizationname lists is as follows.I.
For each abbreviation name matches theorganization names in the organizationname list.
Find all the organization namescontaining the abbreviation name.2.
Rank the matched organization namesaccording to the following criterion.The first rank: The proper name of  theorganization ame is  exactly matchedwith the abbreviation name.The second rank: The abbreviation iscompounding of key-characters f om partof the proper name and part of the line ofbusiness of the matched organizationnames.If there are many candidates with thesame rank, then rank them according totheir frequencies occurring in the trainingcorpus.19There are 471 abbreviated company names inthe price list of the stock market.
302 of themhave matched candidates.
Each abbreviationname may match many different organizationnames.
The recall rate for the top rankedcandidate is 282/471=60%.
The precision of thefirst rank candidate is 282/302=93%.

CONCLUSIONSThe knowledge extraction process will becontinuously carried on in the future.
Theaccumulated knowledge will be utilized for theon-line unknown word identification as well asfor the off-line knowledge extraction.
Theproposed knowledge extraction processingmodel can be generalized to extract other typesof linguistics or morphological knowledge, forinstances, to extract the transliterate foreignnames, to extract the titles of people.Some of the errors are caused by that thetitles of the people are wrongly identified asorganization types, since the patterns of people'sname followed by their title are commonlyoccurred in real text.
These patterns are similarto the sU'uctures of organization ames.
Suchkind of errors can be avoid, if the titles of peopleare known and in fact the titles of people can beextracted by the same extraction model exceptthat most of people's names have threecharacters instead of two.In the future, the knowledge xtractionprocesses will be automatically carried out.
Weexpect hat it will be one of the major buildingblocks for automatic learning systems forChinese morphology and sentence processing.REFERENCES\[1\] Bai, M.H., C.J.
