PROJECT TITLE: SPEECH DATA BASEPI NAME:  John J. GodfreyRaja RajasekaranNET ADDRESS: Godfrey@CSC.TI.COMRaja@CSC.TI.COMTELEPHONE: 214/995-0651214/995-0389PROJECT SUMMARY:The Speech Data Base program is in the second phase of a two phase R&Dprogram.
In the first phase, we developed speech data bases that fueled andsupported the DARPA SCP continuous speech recognition efforts.
In cooperationwith MIT, an acoustic phonetic base \[1\] was created consisting of 10 spokenEnglish sentences by each of 630 speakers (dialectically balanced).
This data baseprovided seeds for the development of several speaker independent recognitionsystems.
A resource management data base \[2\] reflecting query, command andcontrol tasks in naval battle management, was established and provided theevaluation and demonstration infrastructure for the various speech recognizersdeveloped under DARPA SCP program.The second phase of the program is dedicated to creating spoken language systemdata bases using interactive problem solving performance tasks.
Air TrafficControl, Cockpit Natural Language and NOSC's naval battle management aresome of the candidates under consideration.
The objectives of this data base areto provide challenges that will advance the state of the art in language modelingas well as speech recognition leading to true spoken language systems.REFERENCES:1.
