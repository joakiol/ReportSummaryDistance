IntroductionIn the environment of word-processors thesauri serve theuser's convenience in choosing the best suitable syno-nym of a word.
Words in text of agglutinative languagesoccur almost always as inflected forms, thus findingthem directly in a stem vocabulary is impossible.
H01y0ltu,the inflectional thesaurus coping with this problem isintroduced in the paper.2.
Synonym dictionary withmorphological knowledgeThe inflectional thesaurus is a tool which (1) first per-forms the morphological segmentation of the input word-form, then (2) finds its stem's lexical base(s), (3) storesthe suffix sequence situated on the right of the actualstem-allomorph, (4) offers the synonyms for the lexicalbase(s), and (5) generates the new word-form consistingof the adequate allomorph of the chosen stem and theadequate allomorph of the above suffix-sequence.Both the morphological analysis and synthesis stepsare done by the Humor ~igh-speed unification morphol-ogy) method described by Pr6sz~ky and Tihanyi (1992,1993).
The possible roots and the suffixes followingthem are temporarily stored, and H01y0ft0 performs themorphological synthesis on the basis of the new(synonym) root and the internal code of the stored suffixsequence.
For more details, see Example 1.3.
Implementation detailsThe morphological framework behind Holyotto relies onunification morphology.
Both the thesaurus and the mor-phologicaVgenerator (as a stand-alone tool) are fully im-plemented for Hungarian.
The synonym system consistsof 40.000 headwords, the stem dictionary of the mor-phological analyzer/generator contains 80.000 stems,suffix dictionaries contain all the inflectional suffixes andthe productive derivational morphemes of present-dayHungarian.
With the help of these dictionaries more than1.000.000.000 well-formed Hungarian word-forms canbe analyzed or generated, and approximately500.000.000 synonyms are handled.
The whole soft-ware package is written in C programming language.
