THis has been difficult to do.
Previous proposals have leftunanalyzed many phenomena including important motional references.
This paperv*main conclusion is that a much improved analysis can be obtained by representingthe SR's as positioning abstract events and states of affairs.The analysis in semantic nets has the location of an event or state ofaffairs represented as a node which is linked to the node showing the event orstate by arcs: indicating its staus as the spatial attribute.
A few SR's areshown as naming these locational entities, which we call place ,object.
TheseSR' s involve examples with "where", "here", and "there" However, most SRts arerepresented as relating place objects to the position of objects in the manner ofprepositional phrases.
This primacy ok prepositions is argued for in the paper.Motional references are allowed for by functions represented in the nets whichproduce parts of place objects which are then positioned by prepositional f cms .The necessary ordering that'comes with motional references is allowed for byassociating temporal elements with the functions.While the positioned elements are simple, the overall semantic structure ofthe sentences containing SR's is often complicated by the involvement of morethan one event or state of affairs.
The paper includes a survey of the sententialsemantic structures necessary to deal with SR's.
A similar complexity isnecessary to deal with the informakion on the location of objects which is gainedfrom sentences with SR's.
The paper suggests-the use of inference rules to allowfor this.The most surprising of the paper's oonclusions is that a strong tie existsbetween referehces to space and temporal information.
In fact, the locations ofall events and states of affairs placed by SR's are argued to be locations in bothspace and time.
The effect of this conclusion is most clearly seen in aformalized definition of the primitives of the semantic seructures , which is alsopresented in semantic nets.
There, as ane possible interpretation of the placeobject, it is shown as a set of pairs of volumes in space and points in time.TABLE OF CONTENTS.

IntroductionThis paper presents an analpis in a semantic net formalism of the semanticstructure of English sentence8 containing references to spatial location.Spatial referefnce, hereafter - SR, provides either'static location or motionalinformation :1.1 John is at home1.2 Fred ran across the street to the store.The task for the semantic analysis of sentences with SR's is to make clear what isbeing positioned.
This has been difficult to do.
Previous proposals have leftunanalyzed many phenomena including important motional references.
This paper'smain conclusion is that a much.improved analysis can be obtained by representingthe SR's as positioning ab~tract events and states of affairs.The analysis in semantic nets has the location of an event or state ~faffairs represented as a node which is linked to the node showing the event orstate by arcs indicating its status as the spatial attribute.
A few SR's areshown as naming these locational entities, which we call pLaee object.
TheseSR's involve examples with "where", "here", and "therei'.
However, most SR' s arerepresented as relating place objects to the position of objects in the manner ofprepositional phrases.
This primacy of prepositions is argued for in the paper.Motional references are allowed for by functions represented in the nets whichproduce parts of place objects which are then positioned by prepositional forms.The necessary ordering that comes with motional references is allowed for byassociating temporal elements with the functions.While the positioned elements are simple, the overall semantic structure ofthe sentences containing SR's is often complicated by the involvement of morethan one event or state of affairs.
The paper includes a survey of the sententialsemantic structures necesaaBy to deal ~ i t h  SR's.
A similar complexity isnecessary to deal with the information on the location of objects which is gainedfrom sentences with SR's.
The paper suggests the use of inference rules to allowfor this.The most surprising of the paper's conclusions is that a strong tie existsbetween references to space and temporal information.
In fact, the locations ofall events and s tetes of af fairs placed by SR' s are argued to be locations in bothspace and time.
The effect of this conclusion is most clearly seen in aformaIized definition of the primitives of the semantic structures, which is alsopresented in semantic nets.
There, as one possible interpretation of the placeobject, it is shown as a set of pairs of volumes in space and pointe in time.The paper has nine sections following this one.
In the first, thelimitations of previous analyses of the semantic function of SR's is considered.Thea in one section, the semantic net formalism and, in the next, the syntacticdistinctions used in the study are introduced.
The next four sections presentepcr more complex situations.
The first section shows simple direct analysesinvolving one event or state.
The next section presents complex sentehtialstructures with non-movement SR's.
Motional references are analyzed in the next.The connection between time and SR's is d i s w e d  in the fourth section.Following these analyses of sentential semantic structures, a section hs givenover to the formalization of the definition of the st tuctures used.
The paperends with a discussion of the limitations of the proposal and possible extensionsto it.There is available a discussion in greater detail of a preliminary analysisto the one given here (~ondheimer, 1975).
There is also available for comparisonan analy is by this authbr of the same meaning phenomena, in the competingparadigm of model-theoretic semantics (Sondheimer , 1978) The current.paper is distinguishable by its better developed semantic net formalism nnd itnemphasis 3n producing computationally j u s t i f i e d  structures.XI.
Prev ous EffortsIhe pazt has seen many studies of SR phenomena.
There ha8 been interest inconnecting.

g., Cooper (1968).
Bennett(19751, and Denofsky (1976).
Finally a number of studies have considered ourtopic: the position of a SR within the semantic structure of a sentence.Studies of our soet tend to be distinguishable by the type of entities SR'Sare claimed to locate.
In some cases, the SR'B apply to only physical objects..In athers, they apply to only abstract forme identifying events and states oaffairs.
A broad third type of analysis shows different sorts of entities beingmodified.
Each has.its limitations.11.1 Analyses using Physical.ObjectsThe paradigmatic phenomenon for tte analyses that claim physical objects asthe referents of SR1s is the noun phrase modifier:2.1 The man in the car left.The SR in the  above is the phrase "in the car".
The proposals of Norman andRumelhart (1975), Abrahamson (19751, G e i ~  (1975a, b, anc c )  and Schubert (19761,among others, would try to show the relation of the SR to "the iuan-" directly.Figure 2.1 illustrates the typical structure in the style of Schubert (1976).This figure shows "the man" being located (LOCI at a time, indicated by the T- -link, and at a location which was in "the car".This style of analysis seems simple and direct.
It appeals to the intuitionthat only physical objects take up space.
It promises t~ be easy to apply,FIGURE 2 .
I  "The man i n  the  c a r  l e f t "  i n  thest-yle o f  Schubert (1936).s i nce  a l l  t h a t  i s  required i s  t o  a s s o c i a t e  SR's with the  s e n t e n t i a l  elementswhich a r e  modified which re fe rence  physical  ob j ec t s .
Unfortunately,  t h e r e  areproblems.It can be d i f f i c u l t  t o  f ind  a l l  or  any o b j e c t s  with which t o  a s soc i a t e  an SR.Often t h e r e  is  more t o  an event than.
j u s t  i t s  partiripahts' loca t ions :2 .2  John is  playing s o l i t a i r e  i n  the basement.If we hear  example 2.2 then  more than John i s  known t o  be i n  the basement.
Hiscards  a r e ,  for.
example.
Fur ther ,  the  l oca t ion  of the  a c t i o n  is  more than theins tantaneous  pos i t i on  of John and his cards .
For example, space where the  cardsmay, p o t e n t i a l l y  be plaoed mus t  be included.
S imi l a r ly ,  the  following does noti n d i c a t e  t h a t  John i s  next t o  the school:2.3 John i s  playing baseba l l  next  t o  the  school .Hemi.ght be p laying  o u t f i e l d  300 f e e t  from i t .
It can be d i f f i c u l t  t o  f i n d  anyob jec t s  t o  a s s o c i a t e  with an SR:2,'4 * In France, literary criticism is a high art form.2*.5 The explosion was in the garage.tn both the above examples, only complex analyses showing many understood a dpotential participants can allow ?01 object-reference.Allowing fox motional sentences is a very serious problem for object-referenee analyses.
The typical proposal is to show motion as change from onestatic location to another:2.6  The man walked from New York to Chicago.Example 2.6 would be shown as a man's walking causing a change of location fromNew York to Chicago.
Some sentences show intermediate points:2.7 The man walked from New York to Chicago via Pittsburgh.Here, successive changes seem to be appropriate.
However, one class ofreferences to motion seems to defeat this entire approach:2.8 The man walked across the puddle.2.9 The man walked around the puddle.2.10 The man walked through the puddle.Examples like the above involve duration in a key way and can not be shown withreference to one position.
For example, at no time was the man "across" thepuddle like ~aleigh's cloak was across it.
Similarly, two points showing theman's change of position are inadequate since the same initial and finalpositions are a'cceptable in all three cases.
Finally, adding an intermediatepoint will not be adequate, since the man might reach that point while on a paththat otherwise holds a different relation to the puddle.
As shall be seen, thelesson to be learned from these examples is that in allowing for motion, it is theentire path that must be considered and not selected positions of objects.11.2 Analyses Using Events and States of AffairsA second uniform type of analysis postulates events and states of aftairs asthe subject of SR's (see for example, Davidson, 1967, Lakoff, 1970, and Harman,1972).
Events and states of affairs are said to be the two types of situationsthat utterances describe.
Taking them 88 the subjects of SR' e claims that it isnot  the participants but the overall situation that is being referenced.
Thiscan be seen in Figure 2.2, which shows one of Davidson's analyses in a eemantfcnet notation.
The diagram shows that there is a strolling by John which has aparticular time and space coordinate.
The benefits of this analysis include theindependence of event and state existence from discussion of spatial location,the ability to handle location of vaguely bounded events and states, and thesimplicim of application.
However, again the simple direct methods that havebeen proposed are unsatisfactory.It is often difficult to simply associate SR'S with a central event or statesince SR's in some utterances must modify different entities:2.11 John held the ice bag to his head in the car.In 2.11, only the ice bag is to John's head but John and the ice bag are in thecar.
Motion is still a proslerb:2.12 John walked from his car across the yard to the ilouse.How the event of 2.12 can be "from", "across", and "to" simultaneously and alsohave these aspects temporally ordered is nowhere explained in these analyses.Finally, even if SR's are associated with events and states of affairs, the factthat something is often learned about participants' location must be explained.For example, from the sentence of Figure 2.2, the fact that John was in thestreets o f  Bologna is clear, but from the semantic structure only the location ofthe strolling is clear.
No coherent way has been presented to allow for this kindof relationship.Strol ling,FIGURE 2 .2  "John s t r o l l e d  through the s t r e e t s  ofBologna a t  2 a.m." in the s t y l e  of Davidson (1967).W .
3  Nonuniform AnalysesThe t h i rd  s t y l e  of SR ana lys i s  i s  nonuniform i n  nature.
These e i t h e r  mixthe two uniform analyses or e laborate  on the simple event or  s t a t e  analys i s .Mixed analyses claim tha t  some SR's loca te  concrete objects  while some loca teevents or s t a t e s  of a f f a i r s  (see for example, Winograd, 1972, and Schank, 1973)By s a c r i f i c i n g  the s impl ic i ty  t h a t  comes from uniformity , these analyses avoidthe uniform analyses' complementary problems.
However, the mutual problems,especia l ly  motion, are l e f t  unsolved.The nonuniform analyses t h a t  e laborate  on the nature of events and s t a t e s  ofa f f a i r s  a r e  best  represented by Case analyses, see Bruce (1975).
They claim tha teither the overa l l  loca t ion  o r  specif ic  aspects  of events and s t a t e s  are located.Takin~ Fillmore (19711, a s  opposed t o  the betterknown but e a r l i e r  Fillmore(1968), as the model, four s p a t i a l  cases can be seen.
An SR can either referencea s t a t i c  locatioh ( t h e  Location case) ,  place of o r ig in  ( t h e  Source case) ,  p l a c eof termination ( t h e  Goal case) ,  o r  locat ion of intermediate motion ( t h e  Pathcase) .
In  terms of events and s t a t e s  of a f f a i r s ,  the  f i r s t  case can e i t h e r  beused f o r  overall  event o r  s t a t e  l oca t ion  o r  i t  may be used t o  l o c a t e  an aspec t  oft he  event.
The f i n a l  th ree  cases  a l l  r e l a t e  t o  d i f f e r e n t  aspec t s  of a motionalevent.
This  allows f o r  examples l i k e  2 .12 ,  with inherent  temporal order ing amongthe  cases allowing f o r  the  order ing of the  SR's.The Case analyses  s t i l l  has problems.
The two uses of the  s t a t i c  casec o n f l i c t  i n  sentences with two s t a t i c  l oca t ions  such as  the  one where the i c e  bagi s  he ld  t o  t he  man's head while the  man and ice bag a r e  s a id  t o  be i n  the  c a r .
Twoins tances  of the  Location case seem t o  be requ i red ,  but i f  both appear, t h e r e  isno way t o  i d e n t i f y  t h e i r  d i f f e r i n g  funct ion.
Also, motion i s  s t i l l  troublesome.A s  Fi l lmore (1971)  point^ ou t ,  ins tances  such as  the  underlined phrases i n  thefollowing seem t c  i n d i c a t e  a need f o r  an unbounded number of ins tances  of t hePath case.
:2.13 He walked down the  h i l l  across t h e b r i d g ethrough the  pas tu re  t o  the chapel.The underlined phrases r e f e r  t o  motion ordered i n  time, e .g .
,  he walked the  h i l lbefore the  br idge .
However, Case ana lys i s  g ives  no way t o  order  ins tances  of thesame case .
Gruber (1965) po in t s  out the  same problem with the  Goal case:2.14 I walked t o  New York t o  my mother 's .F ina l ly ,  the  Case proposal rnuat be given some physical  i n t e r p r e t a t i o n .
Anyrepresen ta t ion  of meaning must a t  some point  be r e l a t e d  t o  a m ~ d e l  of the  world.In  t h i s  ins tance  the  idea  of a source,  goal ,  and path must be somehow r e l a t e d  t omodels of motion.This  paper p resen t s  a proposal f o r  an ana lys i s  t h a t  i s  nonuniform i n  thesame way the  Case ana lys i s  i s .
A uniform source for l oca t ions  modified by SR's i sgiven, but the  p red ica t ion  of these  spaces by SR's i s  shown t o  be much morecomplex than previously thought.
Fu t the r ,  sentences are not seen as being assimple with respect to SR's as previously supposed.
Before presenting theanalysis, two sections will be devoted to preliminary topics: our semantic netformalism and the eyntactic status o f  the phenomena considered.111.
Semantic NetsThe resblts of this analysis of SR phenamenaare formalized in semantic netsor networks.
This %ormalism is currently a popular choice for semantic analyses.It allows clear, expressive graphic presentations and possesses many positivecomputational properties.
Because of its popularity, it also allows widedissemination of ideas.
Working against this last claim is the $roliferation ofversiods of the representation, for example, Hendrix (1976), Norman and Rumelhart(19751, Shapiro (,1971), Simmons (19731, and Woods (1975).
This section clarifieswhat is meant here by the formalism, which can be seen to most closely resemblethat af Brachman (19773.Semantic nets have been used for representing many aspects of htelligence.Of ten they are used to represent factual information concerning ob jerts, actions,and states.
They have separately been used to show the semantic structure ofutterances It is this use that mainly interests us.
However, there is aconnection between the two uses.
All semantic structures must he related tostructures that represent facutal inbrmation and each use of a type of object,event, or state of affair must be related to a concept that explains it.
This canbe thought of as paralleling the relationship between a semantic structure showni q  the predrcate calculus and a model in which that structure has a truth value.In a complete net, the above translates into the necessity of nodes forconcepts representing types of events, states of affairs, and objects and nodesfor instances of tokens of these concepts.
The "token" nodes must link to "type"nodes that define them.
These definitions must include specification of abtri -butes of an instance in terms of restrictions on values, fuwtional role of thdattribute, and other things.
The instance nodes must be connected to instantia-tions of the attributes.
Concept nodes must also be related to dther concepts.,have overall structural conditions, locate inference rules that map apply, etc.All this information is essential to any artificially intelligent entity, just asthe model is essential'to any analysis in the predicate calculur.
However, forshowing the semntic relations in which we are mainly interested, an abbreviationis sufficient just as only the formulas are sufficient in most studies usingsymbolic logic.
Hence a special abbreviation will be used in all sections exceptfX where the definitional level wili be discwsed.Central to our abbreviation will be nodes that collapse types and tokens.These will identigy the verbal concepts that characterize the events and statesof affairs.
We will call them "event/state" nodes.
They will be circled andcapital letters will be used for abstract types, such as CAUSING.
Nonabstractforms will be shown with names that suggest the interpretation, e.g., Sleepingwill suggest the sleeping state.
When a node represent8 a physical object,identifying information will be included in quotes, e.g., "the bus".
Namesplaced on ascs will abbreviate and suggest the functional roles of attributes.For example, - ANTE for antecedent and - CONS for consequence will be used withCAUSING.
Case names will be used with many event and state of affairs types.These will include:T for "Time" showing the time an event occurred or state held.-A for "Agent" showing the instigator of an event or state.-0 for "Object", the neutral case (as Fillmore (1971) explains-it "the wastebasket") .Restrictions on types of entities which will be necessary will be shown by non-oval shapes for nodes.
For example, time instances will be shown in parenthesesand time intervals in square brackets.
Finally, because it is not essential forour purposes, specification of time will often be left out of most semanticstructures.
Similarly, ire will consider only declarative statements.
Figure 3.1shows a typical struoture.Some concepts that act as functions will also be used.
Each of these willlook like a relation associating parameters with a value.
The value will beidentifiied by a - VALUE arc.
Inference rules will be presented in the form ofLoving\\(IIMOryl) [ 1.11 ]FIGURE 3.1  "John loved Mary all last year.
""subnetll' 2 "subnet2", where on seeing slibnet 1' subnet* is to 'be added to thesemantic net.
These rules will include variables within nodes, where thevariables are to be bound on matching and referenced on inferencing.
Thesevariables will be in the form of capital letters, e.g., X.To summarize, our semantic net formalism uses concept names, descriptions ofobjects, mnemonic arc names, and mnemonic shapes for nodes to abbreviate the twolevels in a semantic net.
Also used are functions and inference ruLes.
This willbe enough to represent the semantic relations involving reference to space thatare being considered.
Unfortunately, it is one more unique formalism.
However,it sdds no new structures, only abbreviating others.
We leave as an unprovenclaim that it will fit in with any formalism which shows identifiable event andstate of affairs nodes such as Norman add Rumelhart (1975) and Schank (1973).IV.
The Syntactic Structure of Spathl References and the Primacy of PrepositionsSemant'ic structure i a  the topic of our paper, but the syntactic structure o fsentences with SR s is also important.
Us consideration clarifies the range ofphenomena king etudied.
With SR, the basic syntactic structures involveprepositional phrases.
All other SR are analyzable in terms of these structures.In this sectian, the syntax function of prepositional phraees will be consideredand arguments for their primacy will be presented.Our main interest in syntax is in structuring our didcussion of semantics.However, the problems of parsing and generation make the syntax of' SR's indepen-dently imprtant.
These are not our topics here.
However, in an earlier issue ofthis journal we presented a parsing scheme that produces semantic from syntacticstructure and applied the scheme to current clags of phenomena (Sondheimer andPerry, 1975).IV.l Locative PrepositionsPrepositional phrases that express SR's can be called locatiye.
They appearconti~~ously, as in example 4.1, or diacontiguously, as in example 4.2:4.1 I put it on table.4.2 The table I put it on is broken.The discontiguous example can be taken as derivable from (reducible to) thecont iguous f o m s  in generation ( interpretation).
Hence only contiguous exampleswill be considered.
These are primarily employed in four syntactic roles:complement, quhlifier, adjunct, and locative object.
There is also one specialdependent usage that will be described at the end of this section.The complement usage of locative prepositions arises only when they are the"complement" of the verb "be":4.3 He is in the kitchen.Quirk et al, (1972)'distinguishes them from predicate adjective and nominalusages.
Locative objects and adjuncts with copulative eentences can be dis-tinguished f rw compl ements by the presence of these ad jec t i vee  and noun phrases :4.4 There are lions in Africa.4.5 He wes important in Chicago.The qualifier usage of locative prepositions is part of noun phrases andshows the location of the reference of the noun phrase:4.6 The man in ths car le f t .The strings in some sentences may make it appear that locative prepositions arepart of noun phrases when they are not:4.7 I put the knife on the table.4.8 She took care of John in Chicano.In these cases, the passive test and cleft-sentence test (~acobs and Rosenbaum,1968, p. 38) can be applied:4.9 *The knife on the table was put by me.4.10 *What I put was he knife on the table.4.11 *John in Chicago was taken care of by her.4.12 *What she took care of was John in Chicago.The asterisk "*" here and throughout marks ungrammatical sentences.
The ungram-maticality of the above examples indicate that the strings in question are notnoun phrases.
Hence the prepositional phrases cannot be qualifiers.Adjunct usages are prepositional phrases that are external to the clause ofa scntence:4.13 I met John on the train.Locative object usages are objects of verbs and internal to clauses:4.14 I put the lamp in the corner.4.15 He yelled at John.4.16 He saw her in the park.There is some controversy on the distinction between these two types.
We canpresent two syntactic and one semantic classification procedures.
First,adjuncts are never required for granrmaticality, while locative objects can be:4.17 I met John,4.18 *I put the lamp.Second, adjuncts always allow shifting to presubject position without loor ofgramatical&ty or shift in meaning:4.19 On the train I met John.4.20 *A t  John, he yelled.4.21 In the park, he saw her.Note that in 4.21, the man is definitely placed while in one interpretation of4.16, the locative object one, he is not.Semantically, we claim that adjuncts locate the entirety of events andstates discussed, while locative objects can locate only part of what i rdescribed.
For example, in 4.16, the locative object reading shows only thewoman's position in the park, not the location of the "seeing" as a whole.
Thefollowing is also informative:4.22 He dropped it behind the door.4.23 Behind the door, he dropped it.Both examples are similarly ambiguous with respect to the SR. One sense, themost likely to be identified in 4.22, is that the end result of the dropping wanthat the object came to be behind the door.
The second sense, the most likely for4.23, is that the dropping took place behind the door.
The firet sense ehowspartial predication and a locative object usage.
The second ehows overallpredication and an adjunct usage.Some forme that seem to be adjuncts do not at first glance appear to makeoverall predication:4.24 On the train, he commented on the Empire State Building.4.25 In Chicago, John wrote to his mother.The Empire State Building's and John's mother's position are independent of thetrain and Chicago.
However, we can claim there is still overall predicationsince the commenting and the writing were done on the train and in Chicago,respectively.Durational adjuncts also complicate the semantic test:4.26 He cried through the tunnel.4.27 He sat still from New York to Chicago.l'hese prepositional forms show duration of the crying and sitting and should betaken as adjuncts.
The first gives overall predication.
The second exampleshows two phrases that individually give ~artial predication.
However, togetherthey give overall predication.
Further, they cannot be used individually:4.28 *He sat still from New Y ~ r k .4.29 *He sat still to Chicago.These are the four primary uses of locative prepositions.
We claim that thesemantic structure of other SK'B can be represented through these forms.
We willnow show this.
In general, this will be done by observing the SR's structure orby paraphrase arguments.IV.2 Other Spatial References as Locative PrepositionsSome spatial terms can have syntactic and semantic functions similar toprepositions in that they directly serve to relate two forms:4.30 San Francisco is north of Los Angeles.4.31 The car is to the left of the building.These examples can immediately be given prepositional-like semantic structures.In other sentences, these terms appear as nouns and adjectives:4.32 The North is desolate.4.33 He hit my left leg.Here, t h ~  forms can be paraphrased in the prepositional-like form which can betaken as their underlying semantic form:4.34 The part of the country to the north of the rest is desolate.4.35 He hit one of my legs that is to the left of the other.Another category, the locative prepositional adverbs, although lacking syntacticobjects have assumed semantic objects.
This is shown by our ability to questionthe missing object, which is a means for distinguishing this category from verbparticles (~uirk et a l .
,  1972, p. 103) :4.36 He went up.4.37 Up what did he go?4538 He picked it up.4.39 Up what did he pick it?A diverse variety of non-prepositional locative adverbs can be handled withprepositional forms.
Assumed objects can also be seen in cases of pairedprep-ositianal-adverbs and prepositions.
These are suggested in parenthesesbelow:4.40 He walked across (a  walkable space) to the blackboard.4.41 He jumped from (a  jumpable place which was on) the table.Some adverbs can be straightforwardly treated as the equivalent of prepoaitiodphrases.
These appear as the concatenation of a preposition and a noun and referto the spatial relation referenced by the preposition with respect to the type ofobject referenced by the noun:4.42 He ran uphill.4.43 He is overseas.The suffix "-ward1' following a preposition or preposition-like term produces anadverb that can be treated as having a destinationel- or orientationel-likemeaning as shown by the following,paraphrases:4.44 He moved leftward.4.45 He moved to the left.4.46 It pointed upuard.4.47 It pointed up the space.Other adverbs can be treated as having a neutral prepositional sense like "at" or11 to" in their semantic representation:4.48 He is home.4.49 He is at home.Finally, many noun phrases that indicate position can be seen as havipg prepoei-tione subsumed by the verbs they appear with and hence can be represented ascontaining prepositional phrases, see Gruber (1965) for elaboration:4.50 He gave Susan the b a l l .4.51 He gave the b a l l  t o  Susan.4.52 H e  jumped the  fence.4.53 He jumped over the  fence.There are a few forms i n  SR's t h a t  I can not  always claim t o  be representedI1 by preposi t i d n a l  f o m &  Theq e a r e  where", "here", "there", and measures ofdistance.
These w i l l  be dea l t  with separate ly .
In  general ,  we w i l l  deal wit%p r e p o s i t i o ~ l a l  phrases with the aseumption t h a t  a l l  SR phenomena are covered.Beyond the  examples already g-n, i t  i s  hard t o  say what should beconsidered an SR. Adject ivw such a s  "10ng"~ and "fat"  inwolve the  abstractproper t ies  of ~ b j e c t s  more than t h e i r  p roper t ies  as objects  momentarily s i t u a t e da t  a point  i n  space.
Many examples apsear t o  be metaphors of SR o r  make obliquereference t o  space:4.54 I stood t r i a l .4.55 I go t o  Ohio S ta te .A l l  of these w i l l  be ignored.
Doubtlessly, there  a r e  unarguable cases of SR t h a ta r e  being overlooked.
For this, I can only apologize.IV.3 Semantic Structure  of P r e ~ o s i t i o n a l  PhrasesSince preposi t ional  forms a r e  the bas ic  method of making SR, t h e i r  represen-t a t i o n  i s  c e n t r a l  t o  t h i s  analysis.
They w i l l  b e  given a semantic representat ionas concepts r e l a t i n g  what is  referenced by the SR t o  t h e i r  own complements, seeFigure 4.1.
The referenced e n t i t y  w i l l  be i d e n t i f i e d  by the - F l i n k  for  "figure"and the complement by the  - G l i n k  fo r  "ground" (Talmy , 1975)*.
Each preposi t ionalconcept w i l l  be defined as comparing the  f igu re ' s  space t o  the locat ion of theground's object  a t  the time associated with the  f igure  (Section*There would have t o  be a second ground l i n k  fo r  "between":I l e f t  i t  between the window and the  dbor.FIGURE 4.1 A prepositional semantic structure.VIfI contains more discussion on this point).
Prepositional concepts will all beconsidered abstract and written in capital letters.
The reason abstract formsare used will become clear in the following sections.One particular dependent use of the preposition "from" f all8 outside thesimple pattern shown in Figure 4.1 as well as outside of the four claeeerr ofprepositional usages:4.56 John .is far from home.4.57 John is acr-oss the street from home.In both of the above, John i p  distant from home.
But in 4.57, John is not acrossthe street in the usual aenee of "across" stretching the width of the street.
AsBennett (1975) points out, the "across1' and "from" phrases combine in euch a waythat we understand that it is the way that must be travelled in starting from homeand going to John that is "across the streetB'.
* This can be allowed for insemantic nets with a function, - WAY, producing a path through space joining twopoints identified by INIT for Initial and FIN for Final links, see Figure 4.2.- -For example 4.57, G would identify the cltreet, INIT the home, and FIN where John-e rame meaning also ariaer in sentences such as the following where thereis an understood "from point" that muat be represented:He died acroae the river.is.
How John's location i s  to be shown i s  explained in  the next section, wherethe baaic and simpler SR's are analyzed.FIGURE 4.2 A prepositional semantic structurefor the special  "from" usage.V.
Static Adjunct, Complement and Qualifier usagesSection I describes our basic claim: the source of the locations beingreferenced by SB's can be represented as being the locations of events and statesof affairs.
In this section, this claim is associated with the amantic netmodel and applied to those types of SR's for which it works immediately.
These arethe static adjunct, complement and qualifier usages.V.
1 Basic StructuresIn our semantic net model, the locations of events and states of affairswill be shown as attributes of eventhate nodes through arcs leading from thenodes to locational entities.
For each event/state node involved with an SR therewill be only one such arc and locational entity.
Theee atcs will be labelled - P tosuggest a spatial attribute or "Place" case.
The locational entities will bereferred to as place objects.
They are the basis of our analysis.
These placeobjects can be taken for the time being as volumes in space.
The sort of ~ o l u m ethey are will be ela6orated upon.
Place objects will be identified by boxes.Figure 5.1 gives a typical diagram.It must be askedwhether place objects are required in semantic represen-tations or simply ad hoc creations.
The answer is that they are required sincespeakers treat t b  as existing byreferring directly to them with some user of"where" :5.1 Where is John living?5.2 I found it where John was sleeping.Place objects can not be outlined strictly in space like a solid can.
Thisis not important, because there is no way in language to directly and completelylocate any object.
In the last section, it was argued that except -for "where","here", and "there", every SR is like a preposition.
Hence they all giverelative position.
With those that do not, "where" can be s h o wleepingTVFIGURE 5.1 "John is sleeping here.
IIas referencing place objects not definite locations.
"Here" and "there" bothpredicate spatial qualities of place objects not specific locations:5.3 John was born here.In 5.3, the location of the doing is simply associated with "here".
Hence asemantic analysis that associates SR with abstract locations can work if themeans of predicating these locations and of fitting them into semantic structurescan be found.V.2 Applying the AnalysisWith the place object, there is a Large class of phenomena that can berepresented directly.
These include static adjuncts (5.4) as opposed to dura-tional ones (5.5):5.4 At the table, John sat without moving.5.5 From Dallas to Houston, John sat without moving.Similarly, the static complement senses (5.6) as opposed to resultive complementsenses (5.7) can be directly represented:5.6 Chicago is far away from New York.5.7 We are finally far away from New York.Finally, direct analysis can be given to qualifier usages which either apply witha static sense to nouns describing physical objects (5.8) or act like staticadjuncts with respect to verbal noun8 (5 .9 )  :5.8 T k b  man i n  the car l e f t  .5.9 swimming i n  the lake i s  fun.These qual i f ier  usages can be contrasted with those that ahow motian (5.10), actl i k e  locative objects to verbal nouns (5 .11)  or @how extent (5 .12) :5.10 The bus t o  Chicago l e f t .5 .11  ~ w i m i n g  i n  to  a cave i s  fun.5 .12 The bridge from Ohio to Weet Virginia i e  old.Applying the place object analysis to  s t a t i c  adjuncts i s  e a s i l y  defendable.One t e s t  for adjuncts i n  the last section was to  see i f  it located the ent irety  ofthe event or s t a t e  discussed.
The s ta t i c  adjuncts are ident i f iable  in t h i s  way.Since the place object shows the location of that ent irety ,  static adjuncts cantherefore be directly app l i ed  to  them.
Figure 5 .2  gives a typical  analpsir.FIGURE 5 .2  "~ohn i s  sleeping i n  the kitchen.
I IThis basic treatment ex-tends to static complement usages.
These relate anobject to some location in space and time.
To show this an abstract predicate,BEING-AT, can be postulated whose object case shows an e n t i t y  whose spstio-temporal location i a  specified by Plaee and Time cases, see Figure 4.3.Proposing a state of affairs to show an object's existence in space and timeslay at first seem artificial.
But in fact, it provides representations ismor-phic to the usual "direct" repreeentatioa of object location.
For example,Schubert (1976) uses a concept - LOC which by a link .I A identifies an object, a linkB the object s location, and a link T its time frame (see Figure 2.1).
These- vmatch our BEING-AT, 0, P, and T cases, respectively.
Schubert sometimesabbreviates SR's when the preposition "at" is used.
However, this is simply anabbreviation and his underlying form remains equivalent to ours.BEING -ATFIGURE 5.3 "John is behind the house.
IIStatic qualifiers parallel either the adjunct or complement analysis.
Asm adjunct to verbal noun, we can claim that an event/state correspondiag to theevent or state described by the nouns can be located by the SR in the same way asan actual adjunct.
With qualifiers applying to concrete nouns there can be aBEING-AT eventheate showing that the existence in space and time of the objectis being discussed.
The qudifier can then modify its place object.
This wouldthen show thefollowing equivalently:5.13 The man in the car yesterday left.5.14 The man d o  was in the car yesterday left.The possibility of time modification as in 5.13 is good evidence for thetreatment of qualifiers as having underlying complement structure (Winograd,1972).V.3 Allowing for Object positionNow that both adjunct and complement usages have been considered, our methodof allowing for the positioning of objects while representing SR's as positioningeventlstates can be explained.
As was discussed in Section 11, an event/stateanalysis must explain how ati artificially intelligent entity can discover thatJohn vae somewhere from the representation of an event or state involving Johnbeing located there.
This can be taken as being something like discovering theappropriateness of the complement form (5.16) from the truth of the ad jmct form(5.15):5.15 John slept in the kitchen.5.16 John was in the kitchen.Within the computational paradigm, the discovery of 5.16 from 5.15 is madeeasy by inference rules.
Whenever the semantic analyses of a sentence like 5.15is presented to a system, rules associated with the type of eventistate nodeinvolved can produce inferable information.
This process allows for the humanprocess of the deduction of specific information about participants in an eventor s t a t e  of a f f a i r s  from kn~wledge~of  the  type of event o r  s t a t e  of a f f a i r s .
Thisis ac tua l ly  what i s  happening with SR's.
From our knowledge of sleeping, we knowt h a t  someone is  where he is  sleeping.
From our knowledge of "working for", weknow t h a t  B i l l  but  not necessar i ly  John i s  a t  the s t o r e  i n  the followirg:5.17 B i U  is  working fo r  John a t  the s to re .From our knowledge of contact  cases such as  i n  5.18, we  know t h a t  the loca t ion  ofthe in t e r sec t ions  of the  objects  i s  learnable:5.18 The b a l l  h i t  Mary on the ear .I n  semantic ne t s ,  these f a c t s  can be shown by inference r u l e s  associated with theappropriate concepts.
I n  Figure 5.4, t he  "subnetll' 9 "subnet2" form describedi n  Section 111 i s  used t o  allow for  the  sleeping case.
Other ru le s  w i l l ,  ofcourse, be needed for  other  concepts.
* The predicat ion of pLace objects ,  h i c ha r e  the loca t ions  of events and s t a t e s  of a f f a i r s ,  therefore  stands a s  the coreof our ana lys i s .
How i t  d i r e c t l y  appl ies  to represent  c e r t a i n  SR's has beenshown i n  t h i s  sect ion.
I n  the  next,  more ind i rec t  analyses a r e  conaidered.Sleep1 ng BEING - ATFIGURE 5.4 The encoding of the  r u l e  "If  you know where somethingis  sleeping,  then you know where it is".
*A po ten t i a l  c r i t i c  may argue t h a t  the e x t r a  processing involved with inferenceru le s  should be avoided i f  a t  a l l  possible.
However, no other  ana lys i s  ofSR successfully avoids i t s  use (~ondheimer , 1975).VI.
Non~ovement Locative Object UsagesThe analysis of locative object usages is not a8 simple as that of otherforms.
Looking back to Section T', most of the problems with earlier studiesarise from this class.
The solution to tthese problems is found in an elaborationon the basic form of our event/state analysis.
This elaboration proceeds in twodirections.
First, the semantic structure of the sentences containing thetroublesome SR's is seen to be more complex than otherwise thought.
Second, thenature of the SK is seen as more complex.
The first case is best seen with non-movement and the second with movement sR's.
This section covers the non-movementtype of locative object.
Section VII covers the movement type.We can review the problems with the use of event and skate location in thenon-movement cases, briefly.
There is a need to differentiate referents whichcan be seen in the following:6.1 John held the ice bag to his head in the car.The ice bag is to John's head, but both the ice bag and John are in the car.
Thefirst SR involves a locative object, the second an adjunct.
With a simpleapproach to eventhate location, they would not be differentiated.
There is asimilar problem in some adjunct references to the location of only part of anevent or state of affairs.
For instance, in 6.2, only the boy isplaced which thehawk is definitely physically present:6.2  In an open field, a boy watched a hawk.In the latter case, although not the former, the use of inference rules might besuggested.
However, a better answer can be found.VI.l Continuous Position and Perception VerbsThe semantic structure of simple sentences have often been analyzed asinvolving multiple events and states of affairs, see far example, Schank (1973)and Norman and Rumelhart (1975).
If we can see problematic sentences in thislight, then perhaps we could assign the various SR1s to different event/states.Indeed, we can do both.Instances of calmative relations betweell events and states of affairs arefound in many problem sentences.
Change-of-state events applying to separatestates of affairs are seen in others.
Simple instances of embedded events andstates of affairs are seen in yet others.
"Hold" belongs to a clam of verbs thatinvolve continuou~ position.
Others in the class include "adhere", "cling", and"keep".
With Locative objects, these can all be seen ar causations.
Each ha8 anaction which causes some entity to remain somewhere.
In our example 6.1, John'sholding-type action causes the ice bag to remain somewhere.
~ e a l i z k g  th i rallows us to analyze the SR's as locating events and states.
The overall SR, "inthe car1', can be seen, as adjuncts were explained in the laet section, aslocating the highest event/etate within the causation.
The "to his head1' can beseen as locating the resuftant state.
This is shown in Figure 6.1.
The TO in thediagram represents a static eense of "to".CAUSING,JohnL 1 - BGNG-0"the ice bag"FIGURE 6 .
1  "John held the ice bag to his head in the car.
1 'an openFIGURE 6.2 "In an open f i e l d ,  the  boy watched a hawk.
""Watch" belongs t o  a c l a s s  of verbs that  includes "hear", "see", and"taste".
These can a l l  be seen as  involving the perception of another event ors t a t e  of a f fa i r s .
*  I n  our example 6.2,  it is the being somewhere, t he  ex i s t ing ,of a hawk t h a t  is watched.
How t h i s  allows f o r  the  SR to be associa ted with thecorrect event / s ta te  is evident from Figure 6.2.
This analysis may seem somewhatforced here ,  but o ther  exmaples show more over t  event or state forms:6 .
3  I watched the  mating of the doves6 .
4  I saw the  delivery of t h e  baby.6.5 I heard the cooing of the doves.m e s e  verbs occasionally appear without an object:I heard through the  door.On these occasiow, an assumed e n t i t y  can be added t o  the semantic s t ruc tu re :I heard ( sane thing) through the door.Inference rules play an important part in these analyses.
For example, thepositioning of John and the ice bag must be derivable from the structure ofFigure 6.1.
An inference rule must associate the position of the HOLDING-ACTIONwith their positions.
Another rule must relate a place object for the HOLDING-ACTION as inside that of the CAUSING.
Conversely, there should be no inferencerule applying to the structure of Figure 6.2 to show the place object of theBEING-AT as being contained in that of the Watching.VI.2 Other Verb ClassesThere are a number of other classes of verbs that take static locativeobjects, see Table 1.
We will survey their analysis in the remainder of thesection and close with a comment on several related forms.TABLE 1,- A CATEGORIZATION OF SOME VERBS THAT ACCEPTNON-MOVEMENT LOCATIVE OBJECTS1.
Continuous Position: adhere, cling, hide, hold, keep.2.
Perception: hear, see, taste.3.
Attachment, Containment, Posture, and Creation: build, close, crouch,draw, erect, glue, hang, lay, lean, lock, nail, paint, sew, shut,sit, stand, write.4.
Contact: grab, hit, kick, kiss, kneel, punch, slap, slug, touch.5.
Change of State: break, chop, cook, cut, fry, shatter, spill, split.6.
Discovery and Thought: dream, find, imagine, lose, recognize, remember,spot, think.7.
Copula-like: happen, gave, occur, remain, stay, take place.8.
Portability: bring, carry, send, take, wear.The next class of verbs adds anokher abstract predicate to the set of formswe have considered:c( him"FIGURE 6.3 "H& nailed it to the wall.
"6.6 He nailed it t~ the wall.6.7 He shut'it in the rgom.6.8 He sat it on the trible.6.9 He drew it on a napkin.The above sentences involve attachment, containment, posture, and creation.
Eachhas an element of coming-into-being that must be represented.
The standard formfor these sentences shows the action of an agent causing the bringing about of astate of affairs.
The locative object is shown locating this state of affairs,see Figure 6.3.
The coming-into-being concept in this structure is labelledCOMING-ABOUT.
The segment of the structure inside the dotted line is there toshow the analysis these verbs take in the second type of usage they allow:6.10 It is nailed to the wall.6.11 It is shut in the room.6.12 It sits on the table.6.13 It is drawn on a napkin.These; examples lack agents and any sort of causation.
The farma within thedotted line in Figure 6.3 show exactly this structure.The prepositional form, TO, in Figure 6.3, is to be understood in the staticsense just as with Figure 6.1.
In fact, this is the case with all prepositionalforms used here.
It is an important advantage of this analysis that it uses onlystatic senses in semantic structures.
On the surface, it is often said that thelocative objects of the current set of verbs have dynamic senses.
However, witha separate inchoative eventletate, this is unnecessary.
This allows.
tb+ repre-sentation of presuppositions like "to" or "on to" either through "at" or "on" asCruber (1965) does, or through their own static bense as in example 6.10. e his isone in a series of reductions.
It was shown in Section IV that some doubleprepositional phrase structures involved "from" can be reduced to a simpler form.It will be seen elsewhere that other simplications can be made.
That underlyingsenses of the prepositions are being used explains why our prepositional conceptshave been capitalized.Another class of verbs-shows contact.
They take the two types of analysesjust discussed.
They also show a coming-into-being sense vhen no agent i~present but a state is achieved.
All three cases are shown in the following:6.14 I touched her on her face with my hand.6.15 The tree touches the window near the top.6.16 The ball touched my leg near the knee.The semantic structures for each of these can contain an event/state showingcontact between the two objects to which the SR's can be applied.Another class of verbs which show change of state have all three types ofstructures with locative object usages:6.17 I broke it on the rim.6.18 The cup broke on the rim.6.19 The cup is broken on the rim.6.17 is causative/coming-into-being, 6.19 is coming-into-being, and 6.19 isstatic only.
The static form in each can again take the SR.
In noncausativeexamples with thelse change of state verbs, SR's generally appear to act aslocative objects, as a test from Section IV shows:6.20 The cup broke on my knee.6.21 *On my knee, the cup broke.The noncausative examples includes SR' s which reference ob jeats not inherentlypossessed by the changed object, such as 6.20, but which place the entire event.In these cases, the SR'r should be treated similarly to adjuncts and &ownapplying to the COMING-ABOUT event/state.Some verbe which take locative objects are like perception verbs in notrequiring causative analyses to explain locative object usages.
These lncludediscovery and thought verbs, such asl'spot" and "thought".
They can be ahown withembedded event/states.
With locative object readings, 6.22 and 6.23 involve onlylocating of the direct objects:6.22 I spotted her behind the dresser.6.23 I thought of Mary at the seashore.These entities can be shown in an event/state claiming they existed in a certaintime and space with the SR predicating that event/state.
This treatment wouldparallel the structure of overt examples of embedded events as in the following:6.24 I spotted you stealing some bananas.6.25 I thought of you dancing.Finally, as Lyons (1968) notes, some verbs, which we treat here as havinglocative objects, seem to relate to SR'S in the same way as the complementusages :6.26 It occurred in Chicago.6.27 It remained in New Orleans.These can be analyzed with one eventistate showing both adjunct and locativeobjects identifying the same entity.So we have seen that the complexity associated with many SR's comes fromtheir semantic environment, not themselves.
With the exception of a class ofverbs covered in the next section this covers the range of verbs that take non-movement locative objects.
Also covered but only indirectly are a few sensesleft from the last chapter.
We can now see how qualifiers of verbal nouns thatare acting as non-movement locative objects can be analyzed.
We can also seethat resultive senses of the copula can be shown with a COMING-ABOUT, see Figure6.4.COMING-ABOUTFIGGRE 6.4 He is j u s t  now in the house.VII.
MotionProblems with motion arise in every analysis of SR considered in Section 11.In this section, what is, as far as we know, an entirely unique approach to thesemantics of motion is presented.
Our analysisa centers on movement locativeobjects.
As has been mentioned, this involves cmplex modification of thelocation of motional events.
The section first presents a brief discussion ofthe structure of movement sentences, then motivates our view of motion predica-tion, and finally presents the details of the representation.VII .1 The Structure of Movemement SentencesThc verbs that take movement locative objects are numerous, see MillerIf ( 1972) .
They include come", "go", "bringff, "take", "climb", "drivef', "bit" 911 I I puntf', set1', etc.
The structure of the sentences with movement locativeobjects resembles that of sentences with non-movdment locative objects in beingcomplex.
Nearly all examples show causative structure with an actioin in oneevent/state causing motion in another  illmo more, 1971).
The appropriate analysesapproximately pairs the following:7.1 John threw the ball through the door.7.2 John's throwing caused* the ball to go through the doox.7.3 Mary walked out of the house.7.4 Mary's walking caused her to go out of the house.The only sentences which take simple, causative-like analyses are those with "go"and "come".An important aspect of the analysis of movement SRfs is the concept to be1 I used in the motional event/state.
The semantic equivalents of "got1 or comef'will not do.
These verbs have special deictic conditions on them (Fillmore7-.5 Go there.7.6 *Go here.7.7 *Come there.7.8 Come here.FIGURE 7.1 The basic structure for movement locative object sentences.Only "take" and "bring" show the same pattern.
For this reason, an abstractconcept of pure motion, called - GOING, will be used in our analysis.
Figure 7.1shows the sentential structure into which most movement SR's will t .
Thestructures for "take" and "bring" will have Going and Coming, respectively, inplace of the abstract form.
For "go" and "come" themselves, the semanticstructures will match the motional event/state shown wj th the other verbs withthe exception of the type of eventhtate.
The place objects of all the motionalevents can be considered the same, as can the way SR's apply to the differenttypes of motion.
We can also think of motional qualifiers as analyzable with thesame structure.
Because of this, the structure of movement predication will beconsidered in general and isolated from other forms.VZI .2  Thinking About Motion rA s  was pointed out  i n  Section 11, one reason that  motional SR1s ared i f f i c u l t  i s  the mult ip le  predications of different types which must be orderablei n  t i m e .
These problems can be overcome with appropr ia te  consideration of themotion and the  place objects of motional events.The ineight  for a b e t t e r  ana lys i s  comes from considering answers t oquestions of where motion occurs.
Consider t he  answer t o  where the firstMarathon was run.
It i s  probably some thing l i k e  "in Greece" o r  "from Marathon t o~ t h e n s " .
These tend t o  place the e n t i r e t y  of motion.
It i s  unl ikely  to  be j u s t"from ~ a r a t h o n "  or "to Athens".
These jus t  place, p a r t  of the  motioa.
People tendI t  t o  locate motion as i f  i t  were a s i n g l e  thing,  a motion" so t o  speak.
This ishow we propose t o  think of the  place object  of motibnal events.Place objects  of motional events can be thought of a s  showing t h a t  motion,e s s e n t i a l l y  showing a t r a c e  of the path of motion.
This t r a c e  yould be similar t othe  t r ace  a piece o f  chalk leaves a s  i t  crosses  a blackboard.
But it should bethe marks t h a t  would be made by the e n t i r e  chalk i f  space was a three-dimeneionalblackboard and the en t i re  chalk could wr i te .
This idea is displayed p i c t o r i a l l yi n  Figure  7.2 with another example where something approaching an overexposedphotograph of a r o l l i n g  b a l l  shows a s o l i d  cyl inder  t rac ing  a b a l l ' s  movement.It i s  t h i s  type of cyl inder  t h a t  motional place ob jec t s  represent .This t r ace  idea has one great  merit.
It allows d i r e c t  analysis of the mosttroublesome class of movements SR1s :7.9 He walked through the  puddle.7.10 H e  walked across the  puddle.7.11 He walked around the puddle.7.12 He walked over the.puddle.As  was pointed out i n  Section 11, t he  aboue requ i re  a representa t ion  t h a tconsiders every ins tance of movement.
The t r a c e  idea does t h i s  i n  such asidewal kFIGURE 7.2 A ball rolling across a sidewalk to a porch.way that the SR's can be shown applying to the trace directly.
Further, it doesit in a way that allows the basic static use of the preposition to be used in therepresentation:7.13 The bridges across the Mississippi are closed.This was pointed out in Section IV to be the same sense that applied in theI 1  across-from" form:7.14 The man stopped across the street from here.Hence three usages collapse into one with this representation.This concept can be extended to allow for differentiating "up" and "down" byconsidering the solid traces to have an inherent ordering basedoon the directionof motion:7.16 He walked up the hill.7.17 He walked down the hill.Hence, the traces in 7.16 and 7.17 could be exactly the same except for theordering and the preposition could be sensitive to this.
This orderingsens i t i v i t y  shows up with other uses of the prepositions and other prepositions:7.18 The carot id  arteries extend up the neck t o  the head.7.19 A woman stood a t  the f ront  of the l i n e  while a manstood a t  the rear.b n c e  i t s  use is not a rb i t ra ry .The t race or path idea does not provide an immediate explanation for  othermovement 5#'s, those tha t  reference instantaneous change:7.20 He h i t  the ba l l  i n to  the cotner.7.21 He walked out of the house.W i t h  the above we can not say that  the overall  path of motion wao either "into"the house or "out of" the house i n  the s ta t ic  sense of these prepositionsHoerever, there i s  a way we could use the s t a t i c  sense.
I f  we could r e f e r  t opod t ione  achieved by the moving object  a s  i t  followed the path, we could saytha t  there were positions where the object f i r s t  got t o  be "into the corner" and"out of the house".
This would be l i k e  allowing reference t o  the posi t ion of theindividual ba l l s  displayed i n  Figure 7.2.
We can conclude tha t  we ought t o  beable t o  reference par t s  of place objects.Being able t o  reference parts  of motion actual ly  leads t o  a solut ion of theI 8  problem of temporal ordering inherent i n  multiple SR, such a8 .. .

Wecan now almost present our representation.
We w i l l  f i r s t  present a s l i gh t lyi ncap leke  proposal and then r w l s e  i t .VII.
3 Semantic Structures for MotionTentatively, we propose two different functions to produce parts fromcomplete place objects.
These are called SEGMENT and UNIT.
- They will be usedwith durational and instantaneous references, respectively.
The durationalfunction can be taken as picking off bounded parts of a place object.
Theinstantaneous function can be assumed to pick off part of the trace beginning atthe earliest point, and going up to the point of change.
Both functions will havethe place object they accept identified by an S link and the produced spaceidentified by a VALUE link.
To distinguish the two outputs, the SEGMENTizedplace object will have a colon inserted, and the UNITized one a period.
TheI I segments will be shown as ordered through numeric" comparisdns.
Pigcre 7.3therefore gives a tentative analysis for the sentence "The cat came across theyard up the stairs into the house".
One SEGMJ3NT function picks out the motionacross the yard while another picks out motion up the stairs.
A UNIT functionpicks out motion into the house.
The segments are all ordered by less-than-or-equal links.The temporal ordering of the partial traces is the one tentative part of theanalysis.
To have it be sensible, some scale of comparison must exist.
Theappropriate choice appears to be the temporal scale.
- When the locations wereachieved is, of course, what is being ordered.
There must also be conventions onapplication of the comparison.
This is because there must be a way to force thecomparison on only the appropriate end points of segments.
We might develop away of making these conventions inherent, but I propose to make them explicit.C omlngthe cat2' /SEGMENT SEGMENTVALUE VALUE VALUE<-<-ACROSS UP l NTO'I the yard " 6 "the house" cl"7FIGURE 7.3 A tentative analysis of "The cat came across the1 I yard up the stairs into the house.Our final proposal for the structure of motional SR's is to include timeparameters with the functions.
In this way, both the end points of the segmentsand the temporal scale can be identified.
For the SEGMENT function, two linkr,T1 and T2, will identify the times that initial and final points were occupied.- -For the UNIT function, one link, T, will identify the time the final position warachieved.
These structures are shown in Figure 7.4 and 7.5.FIGURE 7.4 The motional elements in "John walked acreas the yard.
"FIGURE 7.5 The motional elements in "I hit the ball into the khair.
"FIGURE 7 .
6  The motion component of "John walked from his house to the cat.
".INow, in order to allow for multiple motional locative objects, two timeinstances can be related with a temporal relation, - LE, for less than or equal.This is done in Figure 7.6.An interesting aspect of the semantic structure of Figure 7.6 is the staticrepresentation of "from".
It is to be understood as showing that up to some pointin the journey the moving object was not away from the house, but that iteventually got to be away from it.
"Out of" and "off of" are analyzed similarly.VII.4 Static Spatial References Applying to Motional EventsBesides the ,durational and instantaneoue predications of motion, there canbe overall predications of moving objects.
These come in two forms.
Adjuncts inmovement sentences place the entirety of motion:7.22 In Chicago, he walked around the downtown.7.23 John came to Chicago in a plane.One class of verbs, which allows both movement and non-movement locative objects,allows the moving object to be statically placed during movement:7.24 He carried the dog onto the bus in a box.7.25 He.
brought John to Chicago in a plane.This class is the portability verbs left over from the last section.
These verbstake causative analyses with a motional event/state as the caused event.
In bothof these kind of examples, the motional event must have its motional propertiesrepresented at the same time as its static properties.
Instantaneous anddutational SR'S must be shown predicating special place objects which are partsof whole place objects.
Therefore, we must show the over411 predication applyingto different forms.
these must be the complete place objects representing theentirety of motion.
This is consistant with our other anlayees, as will shortlybe seen in more detail.
It .will also simplify the inference rules that bring downoverall spatial predications from higher levels to the motional place objects.This analysis is seen in Figure 7.7 which essentially summarizes this section.We have introduced twd new functions and types of place objects.
These haveallowed for movement locative objects.
We must, however, realize that there areother uses-for this analysis.
We will see why in the next section.INSIDEthe catST 2VALUE V&LUEACROSS UP l NTOFIGURE 7 .7  The motional component of the "The cat was brought across the8 I yard up the s t a i r s  into the house.
.VIXI .
Extending the Motional Analysis to Other Spatial ReferencesThe last section may have given the reader the impression that the analysesfor motiopal SR's are really different from those given other SR1s.
Motionalplace objects have been set out as a history of movement in space and time.Nomotional place objects are left as "just" the location of certain events andstates of affairs.
In this section, we argue that this should definitely not beassumed.
The place object of nonmotional SR's must be seen to have the samespace-time structure as motional place objects.
These are several arguments forthis point.Relative motion has been considered only for sentences with movement verbs,but relative motion and references to motion are common as adjuncts of "non-motional" sentences:8.1 John held the ice bag to his head in the moving car.8.2  Jane sat on her purse from New York to Los Angeles.In each of tlie above examples two objects are statically related, i.e., John andthe ice bag, and Jane and her purse, respectively.
However, all are moving.
Onepair moves but remains static with respect to a car.
The other pair is moving andchanging with respect to -two cities.
Hence, motion must somehow be allowed forin these "nonmotional" analyses.
Further , change of relative position must beallowed for in at least one.
No hint was given of how this last problem is to besolved in any of our diacussions of nonmotional SR's.Even when motion is not overt, time may have to be considered with SR1s:8.3 He died in his car.As we have seen in the analyses of sentences like 8.3, the car is to be related tothe event of the dying.
Consider the fact that the car is moveable.
If we wereto check to see if this were true, we must have either a history of the car'slocation or have the ability to find its location at the time of death.
In oherwords, time must be available for even instantaneous events.JaneFROM TO -A<-")fi I FIGURE 8.1 "She sat on her purge from New York to Los Angeles.
.The way to extend our analysis to cover these facts is to recognize theconnection between moti'onal and nonmotional place objects.
Motional eventsinvolve the location over time of moving objects.
Ndnmotional events and statesof affairs do not necessarily involve moving objects, but they can involvelocation over time.
This location is the space of spaces occupied by an event orstate of affairs during its holding.
To analyze the case8 of relative motion andmotion with nonmotional events and states of affairs, these locations-over-timemust be taken as the locations bf the events and states of affairs.
Note thatthis does not change of the analyses presented earlier, only the way they areunderstood.
With the same tyw of place object in all SR's the problematicexamples that began this section can be elegantiy alloved for with the use of themotional functions.
This is shown for example 8.2 in Figure 8 .
.
So inconclusion we propose an analysis that treats all SR's the same.IX.
Interpreting the RepresentationThe last several sections presented the "syntax" of our semantic analysis.The term syntax is appropriate since the form of the analysis was presented.
Thesemantics or interpretation to be given the proposed structures was only in-formally discussed, as when the trace or path analogy for motion was introducld.We noted in Section I11 that semantic nets do not just allow for the syntacticaspect of meaning structures, but also for the representation of the interpre-tation or definition of the concepts used in these structures.
In this section,this property will be used to help formalize an interpretation of our analyses.This is only one of many possible interpretations, but showing it will helpclarify the semantic structures.
The formaloism for the conceptual definitions isbased on Brachman (1977).
Again, many abbreviations of a complete formalism areused.The center of our previous discussions was the place objecc.
This must alsobe true in discussing conceptual definitions.
The nature of the place objectsmust first be defined, followed by the definition of everything that relates toplace objects.
~ventlatates will be discussed first, then the SEGMENT and UNITfunctions, and then the prepositional concepts.
The definition of the WAYfunction wiil not be attempted.IX.
1 The Place ObjectOur interpretation of the place object wiil be based on a discrete repre-sentation of time.
Time can be considered as composed of arbitrarily denselypacked time instances.
A place object can show the location of an event/atate atone time for instantaneous events/states, a set of consecutive instances fordurations1 event/states, and any set of instances for intermittent event/states.Structurally, we can take a place object to be a set of what we can callPlace Object 0DATTRFIGURE 9.1 a) The definition of Place Object.b) The definition of Placelet.platelets, each of which is an ordered pair whose first element is a volume inspace and whose second is an instant in time.
This is formalized in Figures 9 .laand b.In Figure 9.la, the node labelled Place Object stands for the concept of aplace object.
An arc with the special label DATTR points to its one definingattribute.
This attribute and a11 others in this section are shown by a specialnode shaped as a square.
The fact that placelets are members of the set thatcompose place objects is the defining attribute of place objects, This nodecaptures this by using an arc labelled ROLE to point to the special name Membe'r-and one labelled V-R for value-restriction to point to the restriction on anymember, namely that it must be a Pldcelet.
In Figure 9.lb, the concept Placel*is defined.
In this case, the concept has two defining attributes since aplacelet must have a space and a time.
The two attributes are shown accordinglywith the one in the role restricted to be a SPACE and one in the role called - tbeing a - TIME.
The concepts of SPACE and TIME will be treated as primitive, here.IX.2 Event/States and Place ObjectsThe structure we defined for place objects will be referenced whenevel placeobjects are used.
One reference will be in eventlstatea where place objects areinvolved with the case P. Hence, with the conceptual definition of every type ofevent/state that has a location, there will be a definingattribute with role Pand value-restriction Place Object.It is also the case that with each event/state, there will be a way to ehawhow the place object fits in with the .definition of the event/state.
Thig willinclude the way in which the place object will be related to the participants inthe eventlstate and structural restrictions on the place object Consider the-abstract eventlstate GOING.
GOING requires of its place object that theplacelets showlwhe.re the moving object was at each instance during the movement.,The placelets must refer to the time of the GOING.
Since a discrete represen-tation -of time is used, placelets for successive instances of time during themovement must show an overlap in  positions occupied.
Further, since movement isFIGURE 9.2 Partial Definition of GOING.necessary at least two positions among the placelets must be different.
Allthese facts will have to be shown in the definition of GOING.In order to show the flavor of eyent/state definition, we show in Figure 9.2the relation between moving object and place object for GOING.
The definitionshows that the event/state has three attributes corresponding to the cases, P, T,and 0 .
Names have been added to the attribute nodes to make this easier to see.The everitlstate also has a structure identified by a special 5-C link, torstructural conditions, which is used to identify how the event/stete is struc-tured.
The conditions for GOING are a set of conjuncts identified by the label inthe diamond shaped node.
This shape is an ald to the reader and indicates alogical operator.
The structure necessary for the spatial relation is theleftmost of the conjuncta.
It essentially takes the form of an implicationstatement eaying that for every placelet in the place object, the moving object,which is identified by the 0 role, will have a BEING-AT holding for the place andtime in the placelet.
The statement begins with a logic node, labelled EVERY,identifying a universal quantification.
The domain of the quantified variable isshown by the link labelled - x.
By po3nting to the appropriate attribute node, therestriction is to the set of placelets in the place object.
The link labelled - Pidentif ies the proposition within the scope of the quantifiet which shows thatfor Cach placelet BEING-AT is the case for the entity in the 0 role at the placeand time of that placelet.
The representation of this last depends on theability to focus in on attributes of entities being quantified over, for whichsee the FOCUS-SUBFOCUS mechanism in Brachman (1977).
This ability is indicatedhere by the special representation of the P attribute.IX.3 The SEGMENT and UNIT Functions-Formalizing the definitions of the SEGMENT and UNIT functions is fairlystraightforward.
Both can merely identify subsets of sets of placelets.
Thestructural conditions for both can be shown with the same function which can becalled GENERATE-RANGE.
It can be asstuned to apply to any set and to produce thesubset that fits a range defined by two limits and a measure.
Since thedefinitions are similar, only the UNIT function will be shown, see Figure 9.3.The GENERATE-RANGE function for the UNIT definition can take as its input,identified by the SOURCE link, the place object marked by the S link of the UNITfunction.
The scale for measurement can be established by reference to a specialTemporal scale.
and apply to the time values in the set of placelets beingoperated on.
The boundaries of the subset to be generated can be shown by FROM-and - TO linke.
The FROM value would be produced from the set of placelets by aspecial LOWEST function to produce the lowest time value from among the place-lets.
The TO value can be a placelet with time specified by the T role in theUNIT function and unspecified space.
The RESULT link can show that the generatedvalue should be connected to the VALUE role of the UNIT function.SPACEFigure 9.3 Defini t ion of the  UNIT Function.IX,4 P r e ~ o s i  t o n sPreposit ions a r e  the  f i n a l  concepts whose xe la t ion  t o  place objec ts  w i l l  beconsidered.

The nature oft h i s  r e l a t ionsh ip  depends on the  source of the place object  being predicated.Consider f i r s t  predicat ion of place objects  which d i r e c t l y  show the loca t ion9 .1  In  h i s  new shoes, John walked through the  barnyard.The above eqample a s s e r t s  t h a t  a t  each ins tance during the walking, the walkerwas "in" with r@spect t o  the pos i t ion  of h i s  shoes.

concepts applying to place objects producedby the UNIT function must be done differently:9.2  John went i n t o  the car.Exaq4-e-9-2 ite of thia class with the eemantic structure showing concept Imrelating a part of the going to the location of the car.
Here the position of thea i q l e  object must again be compared at each instant of the place object t o  thelocation of the place object at that instant.
Rowever, only at the last instantwt the relation be ehown as holding.
*Repositions predicating place objecte produced by the SEGMENT function area r e  c a p l e x :9.2 An ant is crawling up your arm.A s*le interpretation of the prepositional concept in the above may beproblematic.
Since your arm could be in motion, a stationary observer wouldinclude sare wtion  attributable to your arm in the ant's path.
Further, even ifr wanted to take the position of the arm at erne one instant it is unclear wbichto  take.
These problems, however, dieappear with.
the realization that the motionrefereaced is not with respect t o  an arbitrary observer but to one on the am.For him, the SR can be treated as involving not a moving arm but one essentiallystatic in space.
This can be allowed for by requiring the conceptual definitionof the prepositions to project the referenced objects' positions shown in theplace object in.
the P case onto the base object shown in the G case.
This will belike taking the base as a static ground and the referenced object as a figure seenagainst it.
*Since the change into the final state m y  be gradual and not dramatic, fuzzyrelatioucl (~adeh,  1973) might be used.
For instance, the degree of "into"'ednees could be quantified with the analysis showing that a certain degreewas reached.V-R*Event / StoteFIGURE 9.4a The definition of ACROSS: higheat level.The conceptual level definition of the prepositional cmaept ACROSS issketched in Figures 9 .4a ,  b, and c. Here again, it should be remembered that weare not trying t~ show the entire meaning of the prepositional form, only itsrelation to the place object.
Accordingly, a number of unanalyzed forme will beused.
Perhaps the most curious one of the forms will be one labelled acroes , thiscan be seen as the physical part of the concept ACROSS.
It would have to be thenext form developed if we are analyzing the meaning of the preposition.The definition of ACROSS begins in Figure 9 .4a  with an indication of the Fand G nodes.
The structural condition again shows the required connectionbetween these two elements.
It has three a1 ternative opportunities for eat is-faction, one for direct predication, one for UNIT functions, and one for SEGMENTfunf tions.
The three choices are reflected by the three arcs projecting from theOR node.
Which case applies should be shown by one of the two arcs projecting-from the corresponding AND node.
The test for direct predication is identifiedby the object in the F role being pointed to by an Event/Statc.
* This is shown by*It could just a8 well be pointed to by a WAY node.

Any system thatuses the semantic structures can also use the interpretations.
Of course, theinterpretations are baaed on one way of structuring plade objects.
Since thereare other ways, other interpretations are possible.X.
Limitation, Summary, and ConclusionsThere are definite limits to the claims we wish to make.
In this concludingsection, we point out several half-solved and unsolved problems, one area wherewe could conceivably expand our claims, and then end with a summary and finaldefense.Metaphorical usages are i~lportant but difficult subjects for semanticrepresentation.
Things like "climbing the ladder of success" are far enough awayfrom spatial reference to be ignorable.
However, some SR phenomena appear to bemetaphors:20.1 John yelled his greetings to John.In the above, an imaginary object, "his greetings", seems to be sent throughspace.
In the.following, a hypothetical journey is referenced:10.2 The bridge goes from New York to New Jersey.Any direct representation of these phenomena using the definitions from the lasfsection is unlikely since a non-instantaneous time interval must be present,while these sentences are basically instantaneous.
My best suggestion is torepresent these using the motional structures but to indicate by a function oroperation applied to every appropriate f o a  that the actual sense is meta-phorical.
Unfortunately, this leads to odious complexity.
It is probably betterto say our claims stop at this point.Many adverbial8 qan apply to modify SR'S or show spatial-like properties ofevents and states.
We have no definite analyses for these, either.
Anincomplete study indicates that these may be analyzable within our model.
Forexample, some forms can be shown as modifiers of a prepositional concept, such asin the following:-3 I put the ball completely under the car.Some seem to predicate place objects directly:10.4 I walked two miles.Others seem t o  coordinate with  SR's:10.5  Go s t r a i g h t  i n t o  t h e  house.Here " s t r a i g h t "  c a n  be shown a a  p r e d i c a t i n g  t h e  p a r t  of t h e  journey up t o  t h et i m e  t h e  house was e n t e r e d .

However, i f  w e  have no t  a l ready met our gdal of p u t t i n gspace  on a par with t i e ,  t h a t  would c e r t a i n l y  do i t .In suampry, this paper has ahown how the .emantic rtructure of 8pati.lreference8 can be shown as locating events and states of affairs.
within asemantic net, this has the form of showing a location ae an attribute ofevent/state nodes.
In line with this, the concept of a place object, showingwhere events and states of affairs held at instances of time, was developed.Several functions were developed for use in predicating locations.
Inferencingof spatial facts, the use of prepositional-like concepts for showing spatialrelatibnships, and the overall semantic structure of utterances was also dis-cussed.Throughout the paper, the main jus tif ication has been that the analysishandles phenomena that other analyses do not.
However, there are other j u r t i f i -cations.
Only one source for space simplifies the modeling of spatial phenomena.Using only static forms simplifies the interpretation of spatial terms.
Also,the use of static forms fits in with proposals for state-based semantic represen-tations (~ercone and Schubert, 1975).
Finally, we can see that the analysis of)I semantic structures, in general, fits in with deeper" analyses of semanticstructure such as Schank (1973) and Norman and Rumelhart (1975).
In sum, thereappears to be a strong case for the analysis.AcknowledgementsI wish to acknowledge the help of David Brown on an earlier draft of t h i apaper and the even earlier advice of Richard L. Venezky and Peter S .

In hearings h s t  month beforeboth the Subconittee on Legislation and National Security of the Houseb i t t e e  oh Government Operations and the Senate Conunittee on GovernmentalAffairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Bert Lancecontended that the Reorganization would strengthen the Cabinet form ofGovernment.
Mr. Lance added that it would also insure that "interestedi n d i v i d ~ a l s ~ ~  i n  the departments would be consulted early i n  the decisionmakingpmcess .In short the plan creates (in l ieu of the  present White Home DomesticCouncil) a "Domestic Pol icy Staff1' composed of ad hoc working groups ofCabinet and agency o f f i c ia l s  who, under the Vice President, are chargedwith setting priori t ies  among the issues.Specifics of the  plan as it affects telecomunications, computers andi n f m t i o n  pol icies groups within the EOP are:I t  abolishes OTP.I t  transfers varkous functions of OTP t o  the President.It grants the Domestic Policy Staff authority, once associated withOTP, t o  review policy options requiring presidential decisions.- It delegates to  OMB responsibility for establishing policyfor Government procurement of t e l e c ~ n i c a t i a s  facilitiesand services, formerly a function of UI'P.- It transfers all other functions of OTP, including policydevelopment and the allocation and regulation of frequencyassignments, to the Department of Commerce.- It creates a new position of Assistant Secretary of Cbnmercefor Communicatfons and Information "to serve as spokesman forthe Administration on telec~unicat ions issues , and [to] assumeresponsibility for the  functions transferred from OTP andthose of the Office of Telecomunications in Commerce,ff accordingto OMB Director Lance.- It retains OSTP but transfers all functions vested in thedirector of OSTP to the President, who may than redelegatevarious functions.- I t  abolishes ISETAP, PCST and FCCST [established.

Congressional criticism ofheorganization PZun No.
I ,  as it pertains to teletommunications, computers andinfomation policies groups, centered on the creation of the new AssistanitSecretary of Commerce for Communications and Information.
Sen. Abraham A.Ribicoff (D-Conn.), chairman of thd Senate Committee on Government Affairs,suggested there wi 11 be "a lack of coordinationv of telecommunicationspolicies with the new Assistant Secretary of Commerce outside the White House.Sen.
Ribicoff also expressed concern that the Assistant Secretary would"get lost in the  shuffle."
In addition, Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.)
,chairman of the House Committee on Government Operations, questioned howthe Assistant Secretary-designate, 'hot the juiciest job in the UnitedStates," could coordinate Govermnent;wide policy.BILL REGULATING EFTS ImRODUCED IN HOUSEA bill that would extend Federal regulation to include control overelectronic funds transfer systems (EFTS) was introduced in the House of~e~resentatives in July by Rep.

,  the Computer and Business Equipment ManufacturersAssociation (CBEMA) , the Computer Communications Industry Association(CCIAJ,  and the Association of Data Processi'ng Service Organizations(ADAPSO) have all filed recent comments in the Federal ComrmmicationsC o m i s s  i on ' s (FCC] Second Canputer Inquiry.
The InquZq is consideringthe role of a regulated monopoly, ATBT, and otherregulated CQmon carriersin providing unregulated data processing services, generally torbiddenby the FCC.In filings last May, the Justice Department opposed broad regulation bythe Commission of unregulated firms which, though they may compete incertain areas with AT6T, are not now regulated by the FCC.
Justice alsosa id  it "strongly supports the Commission' s intentions to base its ruleson marketplace standards, rathet.
than simply technolbgical standards.
"l l e  Ad Huc Telecommunications Users Committee (composed of 15 userscompanies such as the Ford Motor Co. and Sears, Roebuck & Co.) oppased"a prohibition against the usc of new technology for communicationspurposes."
The Users Committee suggested that prohibitions againstregulated carriers' entry into unregulated data processing activit iesshould be confined to the lJpurpose and effect of the services provided,"rather than be based an the processes or equipment used.ATET argued against anbwoverly restrictive viewff of "communicationscommon carriage."
IBM, CBESlA, CCIA and ADAPSO, however, supported abroad definition of data processing, leaving it unregulated, and openingthe field to more competition, they said.FEDERAL MINICOMPUTER.
TERMINAL STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED BY N B SA new Federal interface standard, called '%S-XYZ;" is planned by theNational Bureau of Standards (NBS) to replace the current RS-232C interfacebetween terminals and computers (especially minicomputers) and datacommunications equipment.
According to a June 27, 1977, article inComputemorZd, the RS-XYZ standard should be implemented this month.
Inaddition, an eight-bit ASCII code (in lieu of the usual seven-bit code),and protocols standardizing the user-terminal interface, are underconsideration by NBS.
The eight-bit ACII code could be implemented as aFederal standard early iq 1978.
A Federal Basic standard is also expectedfor 1978.FIRST NATIONAL FACILITY FOR ELECTRONIC DEVICES RESEARCH ESTABLISHED ATCORNELL BY NSFThe first national facility'for research on electronic devlces withdimensions of less than one micron is being established at CornellUniversity in, Ithaca, New York, with a five-year, five million dollar agrant from the National Science Foundat ion (NSF)  .

The teport covers personal data systems maintainedby the Executive Branch in 97 agencies during calendar year 1976.
Thestudy concludes that there was no "significant change1' in the "scope andnaturetf of Federal persoqal data systems, nor was there any "significantchangew in the use of computers to process personal data.Specific findings include: (1) Ninety-seven agencies maintained 6,753personal data systems containing 3.85 billion individual records at theend of 1976, a net increase of 11 agencies and 30 systems, but a netdecrease of 34 million individual records from 1975; and (2) at the endof 1976, 29 per cent of the personal data systems and 74 per cent of thoindividual records were fully or partial.1~ computerized, as compared to27 per cent and 79 per cent, respectively, at the end of 1975.AFIPS IN WASHINGTONAFIPS ESTABLISHES PANEL TO COMMENT ON REORGANIZATION OF FEDERAL CNPUTER-RELATED GROUPS.

The original ReorganiaatiaPZan No.
I transferred these functions to the President for later redelcgationto NSF; under the amendments, various OSTP functions are transferred directlyto the director of NSF.
These functions include production of a nationalresearch and dev~lopment assessment as well as a five-year outlook forscience and technology, both alluded to in PZan No.
1.Brooks1 Committec ~esolution.
On the day after the transmittal of thePresident I s  amendments September 14th, the Subcommittee on Legislationand National Security of the House Committee on Government operat ions,chaired by Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.)
, rejected House ResoZutim 688 expressingdisapproval of Plan No.
I .
The President1 s amendments appear to be responsiveto earlier comments by Rep. Olin E. Teague (D-Tex.
), chairman of the HouseCommittee on Science and Technology, who (in a letter to Rep. Brooks1 Committeelast August) criticized the ambiguity of the President's transfer of powersprocedure.
Rep. Teague called such redesignation of functions "unfortunate"because "it gives Congress no idea of their final disposition.
"Coordination with OM0 Study.
The amendments also state that the Reorganization"shall become effective at such time or times on or before April, 1, 1978,as the president' shall specify, but not sooner than the earliest time allbwable,"in this case 60 working days from July 15th (when the Pkn was presented toCongress), or October 15th (when the PZan becomes law, unless vetoed byCongress).
The April I ,  1978, date would coincide with the conclusion ofan CMB reexamination of Federal data processing by six task teams under thesupervision of Wayne T.

I ) ,  chances for passageof privacy md DP legislation introduced in the first session of the 95thCongress appear to be limited, according to a survey of higher-levelCongressional staff members conducted by AFrPS Wtzahington Report lastmonth.
Reasons for delay in consideration of legislation on DP andprivacy include: uncertainty over adjournment (with estimates rangingfrom as early as this month to as late as Thanksgiving); receipt ofExecutive Branch comments on the Privacy Conunission's recommendations;and consideration of other business, ranging from the Lance investigationto energy, lobbying and anti child pornography legislation.In addition to the privacy legislation already introduced, new Houselegislation is expected concerning rccordkeeping among educationalinstitutions.
The Omnibue Privacy Act is also anticipated, incorporatingprevious legislation introduced -by Rep. Barry M. Goldwater (R-Calif.)and Rep. Edward I. Koch (D-N.Y.), as well as providing for a new Eederalentity overseeing implementation of privacy legislation.
In the Senate,additional legislation covering all areas addressed in the PrivacyConunissionfs final report is expected from Senators Bayh, Heinz, Muskie,Percy, Proxmire, Ribicoff and Weicker.NBS PROPOSES REVISION TO 'COMPUTER X/O CHANNEL JNTERFACE'The National Bureau of Standards (NBS) last month published a proposedrevision (t) to the NBS' Computer input/Output f I / O )  Chunnez Interfaoe(Wuehington Report, 2/77, p. 4) to be adopted as a Federal InformationProcessing Standard (FIPS) .According to the announcement of the revision, Vol.

The NCEFT endorsed recommendationscontained i n  l a s t  February's interim report (see Washington Repmt,3/77, p. 4) favoring limited EFTS regulation and encouraging wide EFTScompetition.
The f ina l  report s findings and recommendations, obtainedl a s t  month by AFIPS Washington Report pr ior  t o  t he i r  formal release, aredivided i n t o  f ive  "general areasv: (1) Consumer Interests;  (2) DevelopmentalIssues i n  EFT; (3) Technology; (4) Role of the Federal government; and(5) International Developments i n  EFT.NCEFT Recommendations r Governmental Issues.
In regard t o  the role ofgovernment with Em, the Commission recommended tha t  Federal and state~omnunications regulation should be limited t o  "the underlying communicationstransmission and dis tr ibut ion f a c i l i t i e s  used with EFT systems .
.
.
, 1tand that  regulated carr iers  should be permitted t o  provide EFT serviceson an untariffed (i. e. , unregulated) basis.
Thus, under the FederalConnnunicat ion Commission1 s (FCC) First Computer Inquiry, distinguishingbetween data communications (a tar i f fed ,  regulated service) and dataprocessing (an untariffed, unregulated service),  regulated carr ierscould provide EFT as an untariffed, unregulated data processing service,through separate subsidiaries,However, WIT is forbidden in i t s  1956 C a s e n t  Decree with the Departmentof Just ice from offering any data processing service (which could nowinclude EFT) even through a separate subsidiary.
The NCEFT does notcomment on the advisabili ty of t h i s  res t r i c t ion ,  but notes tha t  ATGTItmay possess dominant market power which could be exercised i n  theunregulated EFT markets i n  a manner which would force other firms from .
, .and preclude the entry of new firms i n t o  those markets.
"Apparently disregarding an earlier statement contained i n  i t s  interimreport tha t  it may become appropriate t o  have a Governmental operationalrole in  point-of-sale (POS) switching and clearing f a c i l i t i e s  t o  insurean effective national payments system, the Commission ( in  i t s  f ina lreport) concluded that t he  Federal government should "not be involved84operationally, at  present or in the forseeable futurev in POS switches.However, the NCEFT did recpmend that the Federal Reserve continue t oprovide "ACH-like services1!
(i.e.
, automated check clear ing house services),also encouraging private sector development in the same area.Developmental Issues.
In regard to developmental issues affecting EFT,the  panel support nationwide deployment of EFT terminals w i t h  debit services(0-8.
B POS devices) .
However, it a l s o  encourages "gradual expansinnu ofdeposit  -taking through terminals,  an important economic issue with manyfinancial i n s t i t u t i o n s .
POS/EFT systems can make money, the panel added.Technological Issues.
In reference t o  techno logical issues concerning EFT,the Commission~is recommending t h a t  the  FCC's r e g i s t r a t i o n  program f o rinterconnection of  terminal devices t o  the public telephone network beextended t o  include EFT terminals .
In  addi t ion,  it suggests t h a t  communica-t ions  protocols which are inconsis tent  with American National StandardsI n s t i t u t e  (ANSI) standards should be published as soon as they are adoptedfor use by EFT equipment manufacturers.
According t o  t h e  NCEFT, ANSI should'"expedite the development o f  Standards f o r  numbering systems, message formats.
.
, [as well as] s tandardize invoice and b i l l i n g  systems.11In  t h e  area of secur i ty ,  the  Commission recommends jo in t  s t a t e  and Federalact ion t o  develop uniform secur i ty  regulat ion and secur i ty  supervision.The NCEFT, perhaps surprisingly, noted tha t  "few breaches" were found i n  EFI'secur i ty .
I t  added that "a balance w i l l  have t o  be achieved between thecos t  of secur i ty  measures and the value of the losses  they a r e  designed t opro tec t  against .Consumer Issues.
In the general a rea  o f  consumer i n t e r e s t s ,  t he  Commissionrecornended t h a t  t h e  Government should have the  r i g h t  t o  access EFT financialinformation when "legit imate needs of law enforcement" a r e  served.
However,the  NCEFT a l s o  s a i d  tha t  a consumer's permission should be obtained beforeinformation concerning h i s  EFT records- is  released t o  a t h i r d  party.
Consumersshould also have t h e  r i g h t  t o  cor rec t  inaccuracies i n  EFT records, theCommission held.
In general, the panel found present legal safeguards forprivacy of f inanc ia l  information as applied to EFT "inadequate .
"In a finding t h a t  may disappoint some consumer groups, t he  NCEFT said itcould uncover no evidence a t  present tha t  would suggest a need to provide t h eequivalent of a paper-based stop order i n  EFT t ransact ions .
According t othe Commission, such a s top order i n h i b i t s  the  guaranteed acceptance ofpayment achieved through EFTS a t  the point-of-sale.The NCEFT would requi re  a monthly wr i t ten  statement for consumers wheneveran EFT transaction occumed.
However, it would place the  burden of proofon consumers t o  repor t  unauthorized uses of  EFT services .
In  addit ion,  t h eCommission does not recommend the $50.00 limit on a consumerts l i a b i l i t ynow provided with bank c r e d i t  cards.
Instead, under t h e  panel 's recommendations,a consumer could be l i a b l e  f o r  any l o s s  when negligenqe is  proven on h i s  par t ,sag., carrying his personal iden t i f i ca t ion  number [PIN) with a debi t  card.NCEFT Background.

S .
: INSURANCE.AFIPS last month released to the public the printed version of I n f m t hProcescling i n  the United States A Quat3 ta t tve  S m a r y ,  an update of asimilar 1973 report.
A presentation copy of the study was delivered inJuly to the White House Office' of Science and Technology Policy (Waehingtmf'Report, 9/77, p. 6).
Incorporating some 34 figures and tables, the SS-pagereport includes previously unpublished and unassembled data on U.S. suppliersof computer equipment and services, computer users (by government and industrysectors), personnel and education in tbe'information processing field, as well assignificant trends.The study notes that the Federal governpent is still the largest singleuser of computers in the United States, accounting for approximately s i xper centof the total usage in the U.S.
According to the report, theDepartment of Defense accounts, for almost half of all Federal computer usage.However, it added that Government usage is not increasing a$ fast as inthe U.S. at large.
As of last year, the Government was said to employ some9,600 computers.In 1976, the study noted, U.S. computer users (mainly institutions inbusiness, all government and education) spent $38.4 billion includingexpendi tures on computer goods and services, related salaries and overhead.While the insurance and banking industries have the highest degree ofcomputer usage in terms of the proportion of firms using computer equipmentor services, the manufacturing sector is clearly the largest user in theU.S.
in terms uf total expenditures on computer equipment and services,the report said.In 1974, according to the study, the total U.S. computer labor force(including traditional computer-related otcupations such as programer,systems analyst, maintenance technician and keypunch operator) numbered853,000.
The manufacturing sector is iisted as the largest employer ofthe computer labor force in a given field, the Federal govement is thelargest single employer of the computer labor force.The report said world revenues of U.S. computer manufacturing and servicesfirms are projected to double from $31.9 billion in 1976 to $64 billionin 1981, and world shipments of U.S. computer equipment are also forecastto double from $15.9 billion in 1976 to $30.5 billion in 1981.Last year, qccording to the study, U.S. computer equipment manufacturersaccounted for 87 per cent of the installed base of the world's computers,by value.
However, the U.S. share of the world market is reported to bedecreasing due to foreign competition (especially from Japan).
By 1981,U.S.
computer equipment manufacturers are expected to account for 81 percent of the installed base of the world's computers by value, down six percent from 1976.NOVEMBER, 1977 AFIPS WASHINGTON REPORTU.S.
exports of computer equipment are said to exceed imports by a factorof 15 to one and will result in a trade surplus of $2.8 billion in 1977.At the present time, the study said, U.S. firms derive approximately 50per cent of their revenues from overseas sales.The AFIPS report i s  based largely on data provided by three major marketresearch firms (;.e., Arthur D, Little, Inc.; Auerbach Associates, Inc.;and International Data COT.)
as well as the Federal government.
The studywas edited by Philip S. Nyborg, Pender M. McCarter and William Erickson.Research for Chapters I, II,, and I11 was performed by Mr. McCarter withthe assistance of Mr. Erickson.

"At press time, H.R.
I is being marked up by the full Judiciary Committee.However, as the legislation is now written, it would (1) impose a lifetimeban on the post-service activities of Federal employees prohibiting themfrom acting- in matters in which they participated llpersonally and substantially"while with the Government; (2) impose a two-year banonthe post-sefviceactivities of Federal employees prohibiting them from acting inthe realm of their "official responsibility" while with the Government; and(3) impose a one-year ban on the post-service activities of higher-levelFederal employees prohibiting them from acting in matters affecting theagency with which they were employed while with the Government.H.R.
1 would not prohibit former Federal employees "with outstandingscientific or technological qualifications" from acting in scientific ortechnological matters'with a Government agency, provided that "the nationalinterest would be served1' by such actionsand it has approval of the agencyhead.
In addition, the legislation would exempt Federal employees who areclassified in higher Federal pay grades from the ~ne-year ban on post-serviceactivities (involving the department or agency with which they were formerlyemployed) provided that the agency determines no "undue infludencet?

The survey, prepared by Research Associate PenderM.
McCarter, is an attempt to review the issues which are perceived asimportant by indus try-orient ed groups in the infonnat ion processing fieldduring the last two years.
In this first of four installerments, theAssociation of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. (ADAPSO) isconsidered with respect to its membership, charter, organization andpositions vis-a vis the Federal government.Membership.
Established in 1961, ADAPSO is a trade association representingthe computer services industry, i. e. , companies engaged in providingtimesharing, facilities management, software systems and products, anddata center services.
Its 967 member units include large national computerservice companies as well as smaller local, regional and sometimes specialtyfinns, located in the the U.S., with affiliates in Europe, Latin Americaand the Far East.Charter.
ADAPSO was original ly chartered to provide information onmanagement for its member companies.
Thus, it sponsors national andregional conferences and workshops on accounting, sales management,advertising, law, data communications, privacy and security and otherrelated topics.
As a registered lobbyist, ADAPSO has become involveddirectly in influencing legislation that concerns its member companies(discussed more fully below) .Organization.
With national headquarters in Montvale, New Jersey, theassociation consists of a professional staff directed by Mr. Jerome L.Dreyer, executive vice president, who is responsible for overall operat ions.In addition to an elected board of directors and elected officers, ADAPSOis supported by special counsel in the areas of law, taxation and publicrelations.
It consists of three "operating sections" including: SoftwareIndustry Assn.
; Data Center Section; and the Rpmote Processing Services Section(concerned with the technical , legislative, legal and operating factorsof companies engaged in data communications and interactive computing).Positions.

There have been, for the past several months, carefuland extensive procedures to identify the appropriate individual for thisposition.
Dr. Russell W. Peterson, former governor of Delaware and formerchairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality [CEQ),has been offered the directorship by the Congressional Board whichgoverns OTA.
[EI.. At press time, Dr. Peterson has accepted the offer,and will take office January 16th.lThe importance of the prospective (TrA program can be well appreciated byconsidering the volume of data processing-related legislation before theCongress at any given time.
Equally important is the significance ofcomputer and communications technologies as viewed by the Congress,itself.
In th is  regard, the views of Senators Magnuson and Hollings arearticulated in the following letter which argues the need for the 'prospectiveUI'A program.

20510Oear Ted:We would like to raise with you an area of inquiry  for OTA which we havebeen developing for some time and which we plan  to propose at our FebruaryBoard meeting .
:The technological rev01 ution in telecommunications is here.
It began al i t t l e  over t w o  decades ago.
Now w e  find ourselves on the verge ofmajor socia2 and economic changes as the in t roduct ion  of 'these new.telecormnunica t ions  techno1 ogies become econ'omicall y feasible .
1-n theview of many experts, these technologies change the very assumptions onDECEMBER, 1977 6 NIPS WASHINGTON REPORTwhich telecolnmunicatf ons policy should be based.
Those responsible forpolicy formafion must understand the alternative social consequencescompel led b y  competing technol ogi cal choices f n telecommunf cations.Further , they must i d e n t i f y  iinpediments t o  the introduction of  desirabletechnologies.
Without this prior thought and planning, the technologyw i l l  be i n  control rather than the people,The Cpmnunications Act, passed f irst  i n  1934, remains the prevailinggovernmental policy responsible for the shape, structure and function ofthe regulated communications industries.
We are beginning t o  hearcriticisms because technol og i  c a l  events have steamed by, leaving thegovermnt policy t o  operate i n  the wake.
T h e  House ~onununicationsSubconunittee has announced plans t o  begin a total  review of  the 193Act.
Further, the Senate Subcod ttee on Canmunications, which hasoversight responsibiltiy for federal teleconununications policy, expectst o  begin a review of  each major policy area ,  and the underlying economicand social relationships.
Our desire i s  to  reevaluate the assumptionsmade i n  1934 i n  l ight  o f  the new technologies.
This reevaluation w i l lhelp us to ident i fy  the benefi ts  and problem these new technologies maypresent our society, and t o  recommend the appropriate federal role.
Thes u b c d  t tees extensive agendas are fraught with technology assessmentquestions.
We believe t h a t  a properly conceived OTA telecomunicationsproject i s  essential t o  the success of these endeavors.For example, i n  the common carrier area, the technologies for erpandedservices such as da ta  processing, funds transfer,  two-way visual communication,alarm systems and the l i k e ,  are basically known and feasible.
The fealquestion i s  which conbination o f  technglogies w i l l  best benefi t  societg.An assessment of the technologies, such a s  sate1 li te, microwave, coaxialcable, and dqta processing, the services they can provide, the needs andinterests of consumers and the possible trade-offs i n  cost ,  industrystructures and services t o  users, w i l l  assist  the subcommittees a s  theylook into the question of  competition and how t o  encourage the maximumuse of  best available technol ogy .N e w  wire transmission technologies, such a s  optical f iber ,  are upon u sand the introduction into telephone, cable, computer and broadcastac t iv i t ies ,  w i l l  have significant consequences.
An assessment o f  thesetechnologies, the roles they can play  as well a s  the social and economicimplications, would be o f  great assistance.In the area of over-the-air transmission, technologies now o f f e r  substantialincreases i n  the information capaci t y  of the e l  ectromagnetic spectrum.These technologies may potentially change the whole premise of spectrummanagement and revolutionize mobile as well gs fixed-point radio services.An OTA s t u d y  of their economic and technical feas ib i l i ty ,  impediments t otheir widespread use,  and the consumer consequences o f  alternativesystem designs would be very helpful.
To c i t e  examples, teleconferencingand interactive video systems have direct applications to  governmentservice delivery as well as t o  private sector specialized groups, sucha s  the handicapped.
Second, coding data  into signals may offer economiciallyviable over-the-air services to  specialized audiences currently withoutDECEMBER, 1977 qFrPS WASHINGTON REPORTbroadcast service, such as deaf people rural areas, dispersed c l a s s r ~and special categordes of consumer groups .
SlmiZarly,  the overallquality of general audience entertainment s ignals  or specialized m i l ecomnuni cations, such as citizens band and mobf 1 e telephone, can begreatly augmented by the introduction o f  cbmputar technology to recei wrsand transmi t t ers ,The examples that we have cited are illustrative of the act iv i t i es  M a ta teleconaunfcatl ons project could and should undertake.
Our staff ispreparing a more precise proposal for M e  February meeting and we wouldappreciate any input you would lfke to make.
Technolog9 In the telecmmnicationaarea i s  changing faster than in any other segment of our society.
Ithas substantial implications on everyone's q u d l i  t y  of l i fe.
It hasrendwed obsolete many of the previous d i s t i n c t i o n s  betmen ccxmunicatfonaand data processing, between postal and teleccmnunlcations servfce?s, andbetween broad-band and narrow-band electronic cconmunicrations.
We canthink of  no other new undertaking by d A  that can be as exciting or asi m h t a n t  to the Congress.Sincerely yours,Warren G .
