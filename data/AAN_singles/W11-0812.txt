However, most pred-icates are not constituted only by a verb: theyconstitute Complex Predicates (CPs) not yetavailable in a computational lexicon.
In orderto create a dictionary of CPs, this study em-ploys a corpus-based methodology.
Searchesare guided by POS tags instead of a limited listof verbs or nouns, in contrast to similar stud-ies.
Results include (but are not limited to)light and support verb constructions.
TheseCPs are classified into idiomatic and less id-iomatic.
This paper presents an in-depth anal-ysis of this phenomenon, as well as an originalresource containing a set of 773 annotated ex-pressions.
Both constitute an original and richcontribution for NLP tools in Brazilian Por-tuguese that perform tasks involving seman-tics.1 IntroductionSemantic Role Labeling (SRL), independently ofthe approach adopted, comprehends two steps be-fore the assignment of role labels: (a) the delimita-tion of argument takers and (b) the delimitation ofarguments.
If the argument taker is not correctlyidentified, the argument identification will propa-gate the error and SRL will fail.
Argument tak-ers are predicates, frequently represented only by averb and occasionally by Complex Predicates (CPs),that is, ?predicates which are multi-headed: they arecomposed of more than one grammatical element?
(Alsina et al, 1997, p. 1), like give a try, take care,take a shower.
In SRL, the verbal phrases (VPs)identified by a parser are usually used to automat-ically identify argument takers, but do no suffice.A lexicon of CPs, as well as the knowledge aboutverbal chains composition, would complete a fullyautomatic identification of argument takers.
Con-sequently, the possibility of disagreement betweenSRL annotators would rely only on the assignmentof role labels to arguments.
This paper reports theinvestigation of such multi-word units, in order tomeet the needs arisen from an SRL annotation taskin a corpus of Brazilian Portuguese1.To stress the importance of these CPs for SRL,consider the sentence John takes care of his businessin three alternatives of annotation:The first annotation shows care of his business asa unique argument, masking the fact that this seg-ment is constituted of a predicative noun, care, andits internal argument, of his business.
The secondannotation shows care and of his business as argu-ments of take, which is incorrect because of his busi-ness is clearly an argument of care.
The third an-notation is the best for SRL purposes: as a uniquepredicate ?
take care, take shares its external argu-1CPs constituted by verbal chains (e.g.
have been working)are not focused here.74ment with care and care shares its internal argumentwith take.The goal of this paper is twofold: first, we brieflydescribe our computer-aided corpus-based methodused to build a comprehensive machine-readabledictionary of such expressions.
Second and mostimportant, we analyze these expressions and theirbehavior in order to shed some light on the most ad-equate lexical representation for further integrationof our resource into an SRL annotation task.
The re-sult is a database of 773 annotated CPs, that can beused to inform SRL and other NLP applications.In this study we classify CPs into two groups: id-iomatic CPs and less idiomatic CPs.
Idiomatic CPsare those whose sense may not be inferred from theirparts.
Examples in Portuguese are fazer questa?o(make a point), ir embora (go away), dar o fora (getout), tomar conta (take care), dar para tra?s (giveup), dar de ombros (shrug), passar mal (get sick).On the other hand, we use ?less idiomatic CPs?
torefer to those CPs that vary in a continuum of differ-ent levels of compositionality, from fully composi-tional to semi-compositional sense, that is, at leastone of their lexical components may be litterallyunderstood and/or translated.
Examples of less id-iomatic CPs in Portuguese are: dar instruc?a?o (giveinstructions), fazer menc?a?o (make mention), tomarbanho (take a shower), tirar foto (take a photo), en-trar em depressa?o (get depressed), ficar triste (be-come sad).Less idiomatic CPs headed by a predicative nounhave been called in the literature ?light verb con-structions?
(LVC) or ?support verb constructions?(SVC).
Although both terms have been employed assynonyms, ?light verb?
is, in fact, a semantic con-cept and ?support verb?
is a syntactic concept.
Theterm ?light verb?
is attributed to Jespersen (1965)and the term ?support verb?
was already used byGross in 1981.
A light verb is the use of a poly-semous verb in a non prototypical sense or ?with asubset of their [its] full semantic features?, North(2005).
On the other hand, a support verb is theverb that combines with a noun to enable it to fullypredicate, given that some nouns and adjectives mayevoke internal arguments, but need to be associatedwith a verb to evoke the external argument, that is,the subject.
As the function of support verb is almostalways performed by a light verb, attributes of LVCsand SVCs have been merged, making them near syn-onyms.
Against this tendency, this study will showcases of SVCs without light verbs (trazer preju?
?zo =damage, lit.
bring damage) and cases of LVCs with-out support verbs (dar certo = work well, lit.
givecorrect).To the best of our knowledge, to date, there is nosimilar study regarding these complex predicates inBrazilian Portuguese, focusing on the developmentof a lexical resource for NLP tasks, such as SRL.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:in ?2 we discuss related work, in ?3 we present thecorpus and the details about our methodology, in ?4we present and discuss the resulting lists of candi-dates, in ?5 we envisage further work and draw ourconclusions.2 Related WorkPart of the CPs focused on here are represented byLVCs and SVCs.
These CPs have been studied inseveral languages from different points of view: di-acronic (Ranchhod, 1999; Marchello-Nizia, 1996),language contrastive (Danlos and Samvelian, 1992;Athayde, 2001), descriptive (Butt, 2003; Langer,2004; Langer, 2005) and for NLP purposes (Salkoff,1990; Stevenson et al, 2004; Barreiro and Cabral,2009; Hwang et al, 2010).
Closer to our study,Hendrickx et al (2010) annotated a Treebank of 1Mtokens of European Portuguese with almost 2,000CPs, which include LVCs and verbal chains.
Thislexicon is relevant for many NLP applications, no-tably for automatic translation, since in any task in-volving language generation they confer fluency andnaturalness to the output of the system.Work focusing on the automatic extraction ofLVCs or SVCs often take as starting point a list of re-current light verbs (Hendrickx et al, 2010) or a listof nominalizations (Teufel and Grefenstette, 1995;Dras, 1995; Hwang et al, 2010).
These approachesare not adopted here because our goal is preciselyto identify which are the verbs, the nouns and otherlexical elements that take part in CPs.Similar motivation to study LVCs/SVCs (forSRL) is found within the scope of Framenet (Atkinset al, 2003) and Propbank (Hwang et al, 2010).These projects have taken different decisions on howto annotate such constructions.
Framenet annotates75the head of the construction (noun or adjective) asargument taker (or frame evoker) and the light verbseparately; Propbank, on its turn, first annotates sep-arately light verbs and the predicative nouns (asARG-PRX) and then merges them, annotating thewhole construction as an argument taker.We found studies regarding PortugueseLVCs/SVCs in both European (Athayde, 2001;Rio-Torto, 2006; Barreiro and Cabral, 2009; Duarteet al, 2010) and Brazilian Portuguese (Neves,1996; Conejo, 2008; Silva, 2009; Abreu, 2011).
Inaddition to the variations due to dialectal aspects, abrief comparison between these papers enabled usto verify differences in combination patterns of bothvariants.
In addition, Brazilian Portuguese studiesdo not aim at providing data for NLP applications,whereas in European Portuguese there are at leasttwo studies focusing on NLP applications: Barreiroand Cabral (2009), for automatic translation andHendrickx et al (2010) for corpus annotation.3 Corpus, Extraction Tool and MethodsWe employ a corpus-based methodology in order tocreate a dictionary of CPs.
After a first step in whichwe use a computer software to automatically extractcandidate n-grams from a corpus, the candidate listshave been analyzed by a linguist to distinguish CPsfrom fully compositional word sequences.For the automatic extraction, the PLN-BR-FULL2corpus was used, consisting of news texts fromFolha de Sa?o Paulo from 1994 to 2005, with29,014,089 tokens.
The corpus was first prepro-cessed for sentence splitting, case homogeniza-tion, lemmatization and POS tagging using thePALAVRAS parser (Bick, 2000).Differently from the studies referred to in Sec-tion 2, we did not presume any closed list of lightverbs or nouns as starting point to our searches.
Thesearch criteria we used contain seven POS patternsobserved in examples collected during previous cor-pus annotation tasks3:1.
V + N + PRP: abrir ma?o de (give up, lit.
openhand of );2www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/plnbr3V = VERB, N = NOUN, PRP = PREPOSITION, DET =DETERMINER, ADV = ADVERB, ADJ = ADJECTIVE.2.
V + PRP + N: deixar de lado (ignore, lit.
leaveat side);3.
V + DET + N + PRP: virar as costas para(ignore, lit.
turn the back to);4.
V + DET + ADV: dar o fora (get out, lit.
givethe out);5.
V + ADV: ir atra?s (follow, lit.
go behind);6.
V + PRP + ADV: dar para tra?s (give up, lit.give to back);7.
V + ADJ: dar duro (work hard, lit.
give hard).This strategy is suitable to extract occurrencesfrom active sentences, both affirmative and negative.Cases which present intervening material betweenthe verb and the other element of the CP are not cap-tured, but this is not a serious problem consideringthe size of our corpus, although it influences the fre-quencies used in candidate selection.
In order to fa-cilitate human analysis of candidate lists, we usedthe mwetoolkit4: a tool that has been developedspecifically to extract MWEs from corpora, whichencompasses candidate extraction through patternmatching, candidate filtering (e.g.
through associa-tion measures) and evaluation tools (Ramisch et al,2010).
After generating separate lists of candidatesfor each pattern, we filtered out all those occurringless than 10 times in the corpus.
The entries re-sulting of automatic identification were classified bytheir frequency and their annotation is discussed inthe following section.4 DiscussionEach pattern of POS tags returned a large numberof candidates.
Our expectation was to identify CPsamong the most frequent candidates.
First we an-notated ?interesting?
candidates and then, in a deepanalysis, we judged their idiomaticity.
In the Table1, we show the total number of candidates extractedbefore applying any threshold, the number of an-alyzed candidates using a threshold of 10 and thenumber of CPs by pattern divided into two columns:idiomatic and less idiomatic CPs.
Additionally, eachCP was annotated with one or more single-verb4www.sf.net/projects/mwetoolkit76Pattern Extracted Analyzed Less idiomatic IdiomaticV + N + PRP 69,264 2,140 327 8V + PRP + N 74,086 1,238 77 8V + DET + N + PRP 178,956 3,187 131 4V + DET + ADV 1,537 32 0 0V + ADV 51,552 3,626 19 41V + PREP + ADV 5,916 182 0 2V + ADJ 25,703 2,140 145 11Total 407,014 12,545 699 74Table 1: Statistics for the Patterns.paraphrases.
Sometimes it is not a simple task todecide whether a candidate constitutes a CP, spe-cially when the verb is a very polysemous one andis often used as support verb.
For example, fazerexame em/de algue?m/alguma coisa (lit.
make examin/of something/somebody) is a CP corresponding toexaminar (exam).
But fazer exame in another use isnot a CP and means to submit oneself to someoneelse?s exam or to perform a test to pass examina-tions (take an exam).
In the following sections, wecomment the results of our analysis of each of thepatterns.4.1 VERB + NOUN + PREPOSITIONThe pattern V + N is very productive, as every com-plement of a transitive verb not introduced by prepo-sition takes this form.
For this reason, we restrictedthe pattern, adding a preposition after the noun withthe aim of capturing only nouns that have their owncomplements.We identified 335 complex predicates, includingboth idiomatic and less idiomatic ones.
For exam-ple, bater papo (shoot the breeze, lit.
hit chat) orbater boca (have an argument, lit.
hit mouth) areidiomatic, as their sense is not compositional.
Onthe other side, tomar conscie?ncia (become aware, lit.take conscience) and tirar proveito (take advantage)are less idiomatic, because their sense is more com-positional.
The candidates selected with the patternV + N + PRP presented 29 different verbs, as shownin Figure 15.Sometimes, causative verbs, like causar (cause)5We provide one possible (most frequent sense) Englishtranslation for each Portuguese verb.and provocar (provoke) give origin to constructionsparaphrasable by a single verb.
In spite of takingthem into consideration, we cannot call them LVCs,as they are used in their full sense.
Examples:?
provocar alterac?a?o (provoke alteration)= al-terar (alter);?
causar tumulto (cause riot) = tumultuar (riot).Some of the candidates returned by this patterntake a deverbal noun, that is, a noun created fromthe verb, as stated by most works on LVCs andSVCs; but the opposite may also occur: some con-structions present denominal verbs as paraphrases,like ter simpatia por (have sympathy for) = simpati-zar com (sympathize with) and fazer visita (lit.
makevisit) = visitar (visit).
These results oppose the ideaabout LVCs resulting only from the combination of adeverbal noun and a light verb.
In addition, we haveidentified idiomatic LVCs that are not paraphrasableby verbs of the same word root, like fazer jus a (lit.make right to) = merecer (deserve).Moreover, we have found some constructionsthat have no correspondent paraphrases, like fazersucesso (lit.
make success) and abrir excec?a?o (lit.open exception).
These findings evidence that, themost used test to identify LVCs and SVC ?
the ex-istence of a paraphrase formed by a single verb, hasseveral exceptions.We have also observed that, when the CP has aparaphrase by a single verb, the prepositions that in-troduce the arguments may change or even be sup-pressed, like in:?
Dar apoio a algue?m = apoiar algue?m (give sup-port to somebody = support somebody);77atear (set (on fire))botar (put)levar (carry)tornar-se (become)tra?ar (trace)achar (find)chamar (call)colocar (put)ganhar (receive/win)lan?ar (throw)pegar (take/grab)tirar (remove)trazer (bring)bater (beat)ficar (stay)p?r (put)sentir (feel)firmar (firm)pedir (ask)abrir (open)causar (cause)fechar (close)prestar (provide)provocar (provoke)tomar (take)ser (be)dar (give)ter (have)fazer (make/do)0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80Idiomatic Non idiomaticFigure 1: Distribution of verbs involved in CPs, consid-ering the pattern V + N + PRP.?
Dar cabo de algue?m ou de alguma coisa =acabar com algue?m ou com alguma coisa (giveend of somebody or of something = end withsomebody or with something).Finally, some constructions are polysemic, like:?
Dar satisfac?a?o a algue?m (lit.
give satisfactionto somebody) = make somebody happy or pro-vide explanations to somebody;?
Chamar atenc?a?o de algue?m (lit.
call the at-tention of somebody) = attract the attention ofsomebody or reprehend somebody.4.2 VERB + PREPOSITION + NOUNThe results of this pattern have too much noise, asmany transitive verbs share with this CP class thesame POS tags sequence.
We found constructionswith 12 verbs, as shown in Figure 2.
We classi-fied seven of these constructions as idiomatic CPs:dar de ombro (shrug), deixar de lado (ignore), po?rde lado (put aside), estar de olho (be alert), ficarde olho (stay alert), sair de fe?rias (go out on vaca-tion).
The later example is very interesting, as sairde fe?rias is synonym of entrar em fe?rias (enter onvacation), that is, two antonym verbs are used to ex-press the same idea, with the same syntactic frame.In the remaining constructions, the more frequentater (sonfansiter )ntonb)npfnupter lnfvscter uptyfctser vt))funer lnf)noter cteeyfc-n(ter teesonfm?er mhpfpner -tonfcd)dcter mhpfngpeter ngpnef/ w k/ kw z/ zw ?/ ?w 0/1asd2tpsc 3dgrsasd2tpscFigure 2: Distribution of verbs involved in CPs, consid-ering the pattern V + PRP + N.ateere (esonfieio)be (fsieio)rrnpruie (aieeln)tvie ()icrn)teare (yebofnuipre (-r yte)mnubeie ()seonamivie (aippni-ebe (t?ronhre (-r yte)mn)re (miurndigre (vicr/wtnk zk ?k 0k 1k 2k 3k4wbtvi)ba 5to bwbtvi)baFigure 3: Distribution of verbs involved in CPs, consid-ering the pattern V + DET + N + PRP.verbs are used to give an aspectual meaning to thenoun: cair em, entrar em, colocar em, po?r em (fallin, enter in, put in) have inchoative meaning, that is,indicate an action starting, while chegar a (arrive at)has a resultative meaning.4.3 VERB + DETERMINER + NOUN +PREPOSITIONThis pattern gave us results very similar to the pat-tern V + N + PRP, evidencing that it is possibleto have determiners as intervening material betweenthe verb and the noun in less idiomatic CPs.
Theverbs involved in the candidates validated for thispattern are presented in Figure 3.The verbs ser (be) and ter (have) are special cases.Some ter expressions are paraphrasable by an ex-pression with ser + ADJ, for example:?
Ter a responsabilidade por = ser responsa?velpor (have the responsibility for = be responsi-ble for);?
Ter a fama de = ser famoso por (have the fameof = be famous for);78?
Ter a garantia de = ser garantido por (have theguarantee of = be guaranteed for).Some ter expressions may be paraphrased by asingle verb:?
Ter a esperanc?a de = esperar (have the hope of= hope);?
Ter a intenc?a?o de = tencionar (have the inten-tion of = intend);?
Ter a durac?a?o de = durar (have the duration of= last).Most of the ser expressions may be paraphrasedby a single verb, as in ser uma homenagem para =homenagear (be a homage to = pay homage to).
Theverb ser, in these cases, seems to mean ?to consti-tute?.
These remarks indicate that the patterns ser +DET + N and ter + DET + N deserve further anal-ysis, given that they are less compositional than theyare usually assumed in Portuguese.4.4 VERB + DETERMINER + ADVERBWe have not identified any CP following this pattern.It was inspired by the complex predicate dar o fora(escape, lit.
give the out).
Probably this is typical inspoken language and has no similar occurrences inour newspaper corpus.4.5 VERB + ADVERBThis pattern is the only one that returned more id-iomatic than less idiomatic CPs, for instance:?
Vir abaixo = desmoronar (lit.
come down =crumble);?
Cair bem = ser adequado (lit.
fall well = besuitable);?
Pegar mal = na?o ser socialmente adequado (lit.pick up bad = be inadequate);?
Estar de pe?6 = estar em vigor (lit.
be on foot =be in effect);?
Ir atra?s (de algue?m) = perseguir (lit.
go behind(somebody) = pursue);6The POS tagger classifies de pe?
as ADV.?
Partir para cima (de algue?m) = agredir (lit.leave upwards = attack);?
Dar-se bem = ter sucesso (lit.
give oneself well= succeed);?
Dar-se mal = fracassar (lit.
give oneself bad =fail).In addition, some CPs identified through this pat-tern present a pragmatic meaning: olhar la?
(lookthere), ver la?
(see there), saber la?
(know there), verso?
(see only), olhar so?
(look only), provided they areemployed in restricted situations.
The adverbials inthese expressions are expletives, not contributing tothe meaning, exception made for saber la?, (lit.
knowthere) which is only used in present tense and in firstand third persons.
When somebody says ?Eu sei la?
?the meaning is ?I don?t know?.4.6 VERB + PREPOSITION + ADVERBThis is not a productive pattern, but revealed twoverbal expressions: deixar para la?
(put aside) andachar por bem (decide).4.7 VERB + ADJECTIVEHere we identified three interesting clusters:1.
Verbs of double object, that is, an objectand an attribute assigned to the object.
Theseverbs are: achar (find), considerar (con-sider), deixar (let/leave), julgar (judge), man-ter (keep), tornar (make) as in: Ele acha voce?inteligente (lit.
He finds you intelligent = Heconsiders you intelligent).
For SRL annotation,we will consider them as full verbs with two in-ternal arguments.
The adjective, in these cases,will be labeled as an argument.
However, con-structions with the verbs fazer and tornar fol-lowed by adjectives may give origin to somedeadjectival verbs, like possibilitar = tornarposs?
?vel (possibilitate = make possible).
Otherexamples of the same type are: celebrizar(make famous), esclarecer (make clear), evi-denciar (make evident), inviabilizar (make un-feasible), popularizar (make popular), respon-sabilizar (hold responsible), viabilizar (makefeasible).792.
Expressions involving predicative adjectives,in which the verb performs a functional role, inthe same way as support verbs do in relation tonouns.
In contrast to predicative nouns, pred-icative adjectives do not select their ?support?verbs: they combine with any verb of a restrictset of verbs called copula.
Examples of copulaverbs are: acabar (finish), andar (walk), con-tinuar (continue), estar (be), ficar (stay), pare-cer (seem), permanecer (remain), sair (go out),ser (be), tornar-se (become), viver (live).
Someof these verbs add an aspect to the predica-tive adjective: durative (andar, continuar, es-tar, permanecer, viver) and resultative (acabar,ficar, tornar-se, sair).?
The resultative aspect may be expressedby an infix, substituting the combina-tion of V + ADJ by a full verb: ficartriste = entristecer (become sad) or bythe verbalization of the adjective in reflex-ive form: ficar tranquilo = tranquilizar-se(calm down); estar inclu?
?do = incluir-se(be included).?
In most cases, adjectives preceded by cop-ula verbs are formed by past participlesand inherit the argument structure of theverb: estar arrependido de = arrepender-se de (lit.
be regretful of = regret).3.
Idiomatic CPs, like dar duro (lit.
give hard =make an effort), dar errado (lit.
give wrong =go wrong), fazer bonito (lit.
make beautiful =do well), fazer feio (make ugly = fail), pegarleve (lit.
pick up light = go easy), sair errado(lit.
go out wrong = go wrong), dar certo (lit.give correct = work well).4.8 SummaryWe identified a total of 699 less idiomatic CPsand observed the following recurrent pairs of para-phrases:?
V = V + DEVERBAL N, e.g.
tratar = dar trata-mento (treat = give treatment);?
DENOMINAL V = V + N, e.g.
amedrontar =dar medo (frighten = give fear);atear (set (on fire))botar (put)lorrer (run)varantir (vuarantee)cayer (be-caye)soar (sounm)tornar?se (belohe)tradar (trale)tratar (treat)lceirar (shegg)fagar (shegg)ihavinar (spea/)partir (ihavine)saber (geaye)torler (/now)yager (wrinv)yirar (be wortc)yogtar (turn)vancar (vo bal/)gandar (releiye-win)tirar (tcrow)traker (rehoye)passar (brinv)alcar (pass-spenm)sevuir (foggow)yer (see)sentir (feeg)lair (fagg)yir (lohe)bater (beat)sair (vo out)firhar (firh)pemir (as/)lcahar (lagg)lcevar (arriye)ogcar (goo/)lausar (lause)felcar (lgose)geyar (geaye-get)ir (vo)abrir (open)meizar (geaye-get)pevar (ta/e-vrab)prestar (proyime)proyolar (proyo/e)p?r (put)tohar (ta/e)estar (be)logolar (put)tornar (turn)entrar (enter)ser (be)mar (viye)filar (sta0)ter (caye)faker (mo-ha/e)1 21 31 41 51 611 621 6317miohatil 8on imiohatilFigure 4: Distribution of verbs involved in CPs, consid-ering the total number of CPs (i.e.

DEADJECTIVAL V = V + ADJ, e.g.
res-ponsabilizar = tornar responsa?vel (lit.
respon-sibilize = hold responsible).This will help our further surveys, as we maysearch for denominal and deadjectival verbs (whichmay be automatically recognized through infix andsuffix rules) to manually identify correspondingCPs.
Moreover, the large set of verbs involved in theanalyzed CPs, summarized in Figure 4, shows thatany study based on a closed set of light verbs willbe limited, as it cannot capture common exceptionsand non-prototypical constructions.5 Conclusions and Future WorkThis study revealed a large number of CPs and pro-vided us insights into how to capture them with moreprecision.
Our approach proved to be very useful toidentify verbal MWEs, notably with POS tag pat-80terns that have not been explored by other studies(patterns not used to identify LVCs/SVCs).
How-ever, due to the onus of manual annotation, we as-sume an arbitrary threshold of 10 occurrences thatremoves potentially interesting candidates.
Our hy-pothesis is that, in a machine-readable dictionary,as well as in traditional lexicography, rare entriesare more useful than common ones, and we wouldlike to explore two alternatives to address this is-sue.
First, it would be straightforward to apply moresophisticated filtering techniques like lexical asso-ciation measures to our candidates.
Second, westrongly believe that our patterns are sensitive tocorpus genre, because the CPs identified are typicalof colloquial register.
Therefore, the same patternsshould be applied on a corpus of spoken BrazilianPortuguese, as well as other written genres like web-crawled corpora.
Due to its size and availability, thelatter would also allow us to obtain better frequencyestimators.We underline, however, that we should not un-derestimate the value of our original corpus, as itcontains a large amount of unexplored material.
Weobserved that only the context can tell us whethera given verb is being used as a full verb or as alight and/or support verb7.
As a consequence, itis not possible to build a comprehensive lexicon oflight and support verbs, because there are full verbsthat function as light and/or support verbs in spe-cific constructions, like correr (run) in correr risco(run risk).
As we discarded a considerable numberof infrequent lexical items, it is possible that otherunusual verbs participate in similar CPs which havenot been identified by our study.For the moment, it is difficult to assess a quan-titative measure for the quality and usefulness ofour resource, as no similar work exists for Por-tuguese.
Moreover, the lexical resource presentedhere is not complete.
Productive patterns, the onesinvolving nouns, must be further explored to enlargethe aimed lexicon.
A standard resource for Englishlike DANTE8, for example, contains 497 supportverb constructions involving a fixed set of 5 supportverbs, and was evaluated extrinsically with regardto its contribution in complementing the FrameNet7A verb is not light or support in the lexicon, it is light and/orsupport depending on the combinations in which it participates.8www.webdante.comdata (Atkins, 2010).
Likewise, we intend to evalu-ate our resource in the context of SRL annotation, tomeasure its contribution in automatic argument takeridentification.
The selected CPs will be employed inan SRL project and, as soon as we receive feedbackfrom this experience, we will be able to report howmany CPs have been annotated as argument takers,which will represent an improvement in relation tothe present heuristic based only on parsed VPs.Our final goal is to build a broad-coverage lexiconof CPs in Brazilian Portuguese that may contributeto different NLP applications, in addition to SRL.We believe that computer-assisted language learningsystems and other Portuguese as second languagelearning material may take great profit from it.
Anal-ysis systems like automatic textual entailment mayuse the relationship between CPs and paraphrases toinfer equivalences between propositions.
Computa-tional language generation systems may also wantto choose the most natural verbal construction to usewhen generating texts in Portuguese.
Finally, we be-lieve that, in the future, it will be possible to enhanceour resource by adding more languages and by link-ing the entries in each language, thus developing avaluable resource for automatic machine translation.AcknowledgementsWe thank the Brazilian research foundation FAPESPfor financial support.ReferencesDe?bora Ta?
