The Chinese word segmentationmodule uses a rule-based approach, basedon a large dictionary and fine-grainedlinguistic rules.
It works on general-purpose texts from different Chinese-speaking regions, with comparableperformance.
SYSTRAN participated inthe four open tracks in the FirstInternational Chinese Word SegmentationBakeoff.
This paper gives a generaldescription of the segmentation module,as well as the results and analysis of itsperformance in the Bakeoff.1 IntroductionChinese word segmentation is one of the pre-processing steps of the SYSTRAN Chinese-English Machine Translation (MT) system.
Thedevelopment of the Chinese-English MT systembegan in August 1994, and this is where theChinese word segmentation issue was firstaddressed.
The algorithm of the early version ofthe segmentation module was borrowed fromSYSTRAN?s Japanese segmentation module.
Theprogram ran on a large word list, which contained600,000 entries at the time1.
The basic strategy wasto list all possible matches for an entire linguisticunit, then solve the overlapping matches vialinguistic rules.
The development was focused ontechnical domains, and high accuracy wasachieved after only three months of development.Since then, development has shifted to other areasof Chinese-English MT, including the enrichmentof the bi-lingual word lists with part-of-speech,syntactic and semantic features.
In 2001, thedevelopment of a prototype Chinese-Japanese MTsystem began.
Although the project only lasted forthree months, some important changes were madein the segmentation convention, regarding thedistinction between words and phrases 2 .
Alongwith new developments of the SYSTRAN MTengine, the segmentation engine has recently beenre-implemented.
The dictionary and the generalapproach remain unchanged, but dictionary lookupand rule matching were re-implemented usingfinite-state technology, and linguistic rules for thesegmentation module are now expressed using acontext-free-based formalism, improvingmaintainability.
The re-implementation generatesmultiple segmentation results with associatedprobabilities.
This will allow for disambiguation ata later stage of the MT process, and will widen thepossibility of word segmentation for otherapplications.2 System Description2.1 Segmentation StandardOur definition of words and our segmentationconventions are based on available standards,modified for MT purposes.
The PRC standard (Liuet al, 1993) was initially used.

Segmentation Divergences with the PRC Guidelines2.2 MethodologyThe SYSTRAN Chinese word segmentationmodule uses a rule-based approach and a largedictionary.
The dictionary is derived from theChinese-English MT dictionary.
It currentlyincludes about 400,000 words.
The basicsegmentation strategy is to list all possible matchesfor a translation unit (typically, a sentence), then tosolve overlapping matches via linguistic rules.
Thesame segmentation module and the samedictionary are used to segment different types oftext with comparable performance.All dictionary lookup and rule matching areperformed using a low level Finite StateAutomaton library.
The segmentation speed is3,500 characters per second using a Pentium 42.4GHZ processor.DictionaryThe Chinese-English MT dictionary currentlycontains 400,000 words (e.g., ??
), and 200,000multi-word expressions (e.g., ??
??
???
).Only words are used for the segmentation.Specialized linguistic rules are associated with thedictionary.
The dictionary is general purpose, withgood coverage on several domains.
Domain-specific dictionaries are also available, but werenot used in the Bakeoff.The dictionary contains words from differentChinese-speaking regions, but the representation ismostly in simplified Chinese.
The traditionalcharacters are considered as ?variants?, and theyare not physically stored in the dictionary.
Forexample, ???
and ???
are stored in thedictionary, and ???
can also be found via thecharacter matching ??
?.The dictionary is encoded in Unicode (UTF8),and all internal operations manipulate UTF8strings.
Major encoding conversions are supported,including GB2312-80, GB13000, BIG-5, BIG5-HKSCS, etc.TrainingThe segmentation module has been tested and fine-tuned on general texts, and on texts in the technicaland military domains (because of specific customerrequirements for the MT system).
Due to the wideavailability of news texts, the news domain hasalso recently been used for training and testing.The training process is merely reduced to thecustomization of a SYSTRAN MT system.
In thecurrent version of the MT system, customization isachieved by building a User Dictionary (UD).
AUD supplements the main dictionary: any wordthat is not found in the main MT system dictionaryis added in a User Dictionary.Name-Entity Recognition and Unknown WordsName entity recognition is still under development.Recognition of Chinese persons?
names is done vialinguistic rules.
Foreign name recognition is notyet implemented due to the difficulty of obtainingtranslations.Due to the unavailability of translations, evenwhen an unknown word has been successfullyrecognized, we consider the unknown wordrecognition as part of the terminology extractionprocess.
This feature was not integrated for theBakeoff.2.3 EvaluationOur internal evaluation has been focused on theaccuracy of segmentation using our ownsegmentation standard.
Our evaluation processincludes large-scale bilingual regression testing forthe Chinese-English system, as well as regressiontesting of the segmenter itself using a test databaseof over 5MB of test items.
Two criteria are used:1.
Overlapping Ambiguity Strings (OAS): thereference segmentation and the segmentersegmentation overlap for some string, e.g.,AB-C and A-BC.
As shown below, thistypically indicates an error from oursegmenter.2.
Covering Ambiguity Strings (CAS): the teststrings that cover the reference strings(CAS-T: ABC and AB-C), and the referencestrings that cover the test strings (CAS-R:AB-C and ABC).
These cases arise mostlyfrom a difference between equally validsegmentation standards.No evaluation with other standards had been donebefore the Bakeoff.Test Reference Type???

Types of Segmentation Differences3 Discussion of the Bakeoff3.1 ResultsSYSTRAN participated in the four open tracks inthe First International Chinese Word SegmentationBakeoff http://www.sighan.org/bakeoff2003/.
Eachtrack corresponds to one corpus with its own wordsegementation standard.
Each corpus had its ownsegmentation standard that was significantlydifferent from the others.
The training processincluded building a User Dictionary that containswords found in the training corpora, but not in theSYSTRAN dictionary.
Although each of thesecorpora was segmented according to its ownstandard, we made a single UD containing all thewords gathered in all corpora.Although the ranking of the SYSTRANsegmenter is different in the four open tracks,SYSTRAN?s segmentation performance is quitecomparable across the four corpora.
This is to becompared to the scores obtained by otherparticipants, where good performance wastypically obtained on one corpus only.
SYSTRANscores for the 4 tracks are shown in Table 3 (Sproatand Emerson, 2003).Track R P F Roov RivASo 0.915 0.894 0.904 0.426 0.926CTBo 0.891 0.877 0.884 0.733 0.925HKo 0.898 0.860 0.879 0.616 0.920PKo 0.905 0.869 0.886 0.503 0.934Table 3.

Count of OAS and CAS DivergenceThe majority of OAS divergences show incorrectsegmentation from SYSTRAN.
However,differences in CAS do not necessarily indicateincorrect segmentation results.
The reasons can becategorized as follows: a) different segmentationstandards, b) unknown word problem, c) nameentity recognition problem, and d) miscellaneous4.The distributions of the differences are furtheranalyzed in Table 5 and 6 for the ASo and PKocorpora, respectively.CAS-R: Unique Strings=334 (total=491)Type Count Percent ExamplesDifferentStandards184 55% ????????????

Distribution of Divergences in the PKo TrackThis analysis shows that the segmentation resultsare greatly impacted by the difference in thesegmentation standards.
Other problems includefor example the encoding of numbers using singlebytes instead of the standard double-byte encodingin the PKo corpus, which account for about 12% ofdifferences in the PKo track scores.4 ConclusionFor an open track segmentation competition likethe Bakeoff, we need to achieve a balance betweenthe following aspects:?
Segmentation standards: differences betweenone?s own standard and the reference standard.?
Adaptation to the other standards: whether oneshould adapt to other standards.?
Dictionary coverage: the coverage of one?sown dictionary and the dictionary obtained bytraining.?
Algorithm: combination of segmentation,unknown word identification, and name entityrecognition.?
Speed: the time needed to segment the corpora.?
Training: time and manpower used for trainingeach corpus and trackFew systems participated in all open tracks:only SYSTRAN and one university participated inall four.
We devoted about 2 person/week for thisevaluation.
We rank in the top three of three opentracks, and only the PKo track scores are lower,probably because of encoding problems fornumbers for this corpus (we did not adjust oursegmenter to cope with this corpus-specificproblem).
Our results are very consistent for allopen tracks, indicating a very robust approach toChinese segmentation.Analysis of results shows that SYSTRAN?sChinese word segmentation excels in the area ofdictionary coverage, robustness, and speed.
Thevast majority of divergences with the test corporaoriginate from differences in segmentationstandards (over 55% for CAS-R and about 98% forCAS-T).
True errors range between 0% and 2%only, the rest being assigned to either the lack ofunknown word processing or the lack of a nameentity recognizer.
Although not integrated, theunknown word identification and name entityrecognition are under development as part of aterminology extraction tool.For future Chinese word segmentationevaluations, some of the issues that arose in thisBakeoff would need to be addressed to obtain evenmore significant results, including wordsegmentation standards and encoding problems forexample.
We would also welcome the introductionof a surprise track, similar to the surprise track ofthe DARPA MT evaluations that would requireparticipants to submit results within 24 hours on anunknown corpus.ReferencesLiu, Y, Tan Q.
