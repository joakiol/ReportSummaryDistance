Because the knowledge on languageand literature depends too much on texts,advanced text processing has become abottleneck for E-Learning on these domains.In traditional learning frameworks learnerswould easily get boring with mass pure texts.This article introduces a new approach for E-Learning on language and literature, byintelligently extracting real or virtual objectsfrom texts and integrating them as exhibitionsin a digital museum system.
This article alsodiscussed how to generate exhibitions fromtexts with computational linguistics methodsas well as how this E-Learning frameworkpushes the research of computationallinguistics.
The discussion of E-Learning byDigital Museum is based on the design ofDigital Museum of Chinese Ancient Poetry,by Peking University.1 IntroductionComputer based Education has become a veryhot and productive topic in recent years.
However,most of the existing methodology and models arebased on science domain.
This is because theteaching and learning on science domain reliesmuch on the ability of reasoning and computation,which directly utilizes the advantage of computer.The most important carriers of Knowledge onhumanities domain, especially literature andlanguage are textual materials.
Therefore, unlike E-Learning on science and technical fields, a moreintelligent way of using computer to deal with textsis required.
Traditional E-Learning models onlanguage and literature rely too much on pure text.Relevant frameworks include Digital-Archives,Digital-Libraries and Digital publications.
Most ofthem are just ?gathering mass text materials andproviding them online?, thus the interface betweensystem and learners is onefold, non-interactive andlack of guidance.
Learners easily get missed inexcessive bald texts without a ?docent [2]?
toadvise them how to select a well organizedknowledge structure and a learning pathway.Searching and retrieving modules are provided inthose models to various extents, which provide aknowledge retriever.
However, it still cannot gobeyond texts.Recently, Digital Museum systems are believedto be able to provide a vivid interface which carrieseducational uses to participants.
Teaching andlearning becomes much easier from the specialcircumstance of learning in the presence of realobjects, which inspires curiosity and creativethinking, and gives museums the potential todevelop distinctive and meaningful educationalexperiences [5].There are many good examples that approach E-learning on humanities fields with a system similarto a Digital Museum.
The National Palace Museumsystem in Taiwan offers 14 courses on the culturalrelics of China [3].
Digital Museums on more than10 major fields in nature and culture have beendesigned along with Taiwan?s nation wide DigitalMuseum plan.
Lo, Feng-ju et?
al have designed adigital museum of Chinese Ancient Literature,which provides some sub-exhibitions of poetry andfictions in formats of photocopy of the actual paperedition of ancient texts.
[7] These works have beenwell exploring the primitive application of DigitalMuseum in E-Learning on Humanities Fields.To satisfy the needs of E-Learning on Languageand Literature fields, a modern digital museumshould have some specific features.
It shouldprovide a mechanism to process texts, whichwould be able to integrate some computationallinguistics methods.
It should also provide a way toorganize knowledge beyond the texts, and be ableto provide guidance for learning.
This can beachieved by generating objects out from texts andorganizing them into interactive exhibitions thatcan be personalized.
Moreover, the digital museumframework should be reusable to different scope ofbackground knowledge.
Such a modern digitalmuseum associating text processing mechanism isbelieved to be a sound approach of E-Learning onLanguage and Literature.This article discussed this approach on theDigital Museum framework design, how it isassociated with Computational Linguistics, andhow to integrate knowledge to maximize the E-Learning efficiency.
These discussions will bebased on an example of the Digital Museum ofChinese Ancient Poetry Art, by Peking University2003.
[10] The following section will discuss thegeneral framework design of digital museum.
Wewill discuss text processing work behind theDigital Museum in Section 3, and KnowledgeProcessing and integration in Section 4.
Somemore discussion and future work will be providedat the conclusion section.2 The Digital Museum FrameworkInstead of digital library and traditional digitalmuseum systems, which provide single function ofexhibition, a modern digital museum providesmultidimensional functions.
Generally, a moderndigital museum has three key functions, exhibition,education and research.
In our design of DigitalMuseum for Language and Literature, the threedimansion would be: interacting theme basedexhibitions from texts, E-Learning modules onlanguage and literature, and related research onComputational Linguistics.2.1 Digital Museum and E-Learning onLanguage and LiteratureDigital Museum systems have gone beyondexhibitions of digital collections.
Instead, theywould increasingly emphasize educational usesrather than traditional exhibitions.
It provides userswith educational and well-motivated exhibitions[13].
UK-wide Digital Museum linked exhibitionsconnected by subject and theme with an integratedlearning environment [6].
By 2000, the NationalScience Plan of Digital Museums of Taiwan hasdefined a specific and integrated program on howto utilize scientific technology, especiallyinformation technology, and how to digitalize thearchives in both cultural and natural fields, withsignificant humanistic meaning.
It has conductedfurther discussions on how to apply these kinds ofdigital projects and productions to education,research and industrialization, for the sake ofconserving culture, promoting education, inspiringresearch and increment of industrialization.
[3].Knowledge on a learning topic should beorganized  as an exhibition theme, which isrepresented by a series of real or virtual objectsand detailed descriptions.
Exhibitions of variousthemes are linked together corresponding to therelativity of their themes.
Learners can participatein the Digital Museum by choosing a pathway oflinked exhibitions with a typical topic.
Specialmodules will also be provided for participants tointeracting with the system, which will bediscussed in section 4.2.2 General Architecture Design of a DigitalMuseumThe life cycle of a modern digital museum lookslike a fountain model  [11].
There are feedbacksfrom each design phase to previous phases.
Thereare several milestones in the life cycle, each ofwhich acts as a knowledge container and afoundation of knowledge processing on upperlevels.
[14].
These knowledge containers are asfollows:Milestones FunctionalityInformation Origin Pool:(Primitive Corpus)The mass storage of large-scaleinformation from preliminarydigitalization work.Refined Knowledge Bases(Refined Corpus)Database storage of useful andrelevant knowledge fromknowledge refining.Metadata for ExhibitionsMetadata describing ontology,with all detailed metadata forknowledge flows, items andrelationsIntegrated Exhibition BaseDatabase for Exhibiting items,individual or integrated, for regularaccessing by system.Reusable Tool Base forFunctional ModulesTool pool for reusable modulefunctions, individual or integratedcomponents for various use.Multi-functional  InterfaceWeb-based interface forexhibitions, education andresearch.Table 1: Milestones within the Digital MuseumArchitectureBased on these milestones, the generalarchitecture of a Digital Museum on Language andLiterature can be represented in the followingfigure:Figure1: General Architecture of a DigitalMuseum based on language processing2.3 Example: Introduction to the DigitalMuseum of Chinese Ancient PoetryThe Digital Museum of Chinese Ancient PoetryArt [10] is a research model by Peking University,Beijing, combining E-Learning, computer assistedresearch on Chinese Ancient Poetry andcomputational linguistics.
A prototype of thisDigital Museum was designed in order to meet theneeds of exhibition, education and research on theart of Chinese Ancient Poetry.
The analysis, designand implementation of this project were on ahighly abstract level.2.3.1 Corpus, Design and Prototype SystemThe information origin pool and the refinedknowledge base of this project were also thecorpus for related computational linguisticsresearch.
It involves Chinese Ancient Poetry across2,000 years, approximately 100,000 items [10].Other advanced knowledge bases such as AuthorInformation base, Image and media base, Locationinformation base and Word lists were constructed.In the design of this Digital Museum system,knowledge mining was divided into two types,item entity information mining and relationalinformation mining.
Item entity information wasdetailed to exhibiting items, characters, images,media, locations and words.
Relational informationreflected all aspects of relations among items.Metadata for each category of instances wasdefined in the design phase.
Particularly, a groupof items with relating meaning was structured as avirtual item class, which was also treated as aspecific item.In the prototype system, items of poetry,character, location and others were exhibited alongwith all related formats of knowledge.
Users canleap from one item to its related items, and learnthem in the context where they originally belongs.Sample exhibitions on specific themes, such asclothing, plants, food and spring were alsodesigned.2.3.2 E-Learning and Related research fromthis Digital MuseumIn the dimension of learning, Digital Museum ofChinese Ancient Poetry explored the study of E-Leaning system for the language and literaturefeatures of Chinese Ancient Poetry.
It enabled away to learn a poem in its background environment,with reference to its related poetry and otherrelated objects in multiple formats.
The systemalso presented statistical research results of thecorpus to users, such as the words usages ofauthors, the cooccurrence of words, the likelihoodof the hidden meanings of words, which help usersto be well-informed and easier to understand inlearning a poem or a word.In the dimension of research, the digital museumis closely related to specific research topics oncomputational linguistics, especially statisticalnatural language processing.
We refined unknownwords from the corpus though statistic methodsand explored to cluster them into concepts.
In thisway, we studied the hidden meanings of words andpoetry in context and studied the relation discoveryamong poems.
We also conducted some researchof knowledge mining and discovering from corpus,which can also inspire extended researches likeComputer Assisted archaeology on ChineseAncient Poetry.3 Language Processing behind the DigitalMuseum FrameworkKnowledge of humanities areas, especiallylanguage and literature, is commonly carried bytexts.
Therefore, the language processing,specifically the text processing will be vital fortransforming pure texts and domain knowledgeinto abstracted exhibitions.
Actually, most digitalmuseums today haven't made good use ofcomputational linguistics techniques.
Most of themremain on organizing exhibitions manually andproviding them online.
Those exhibitions arerelatively isolated from each other.However, there are remarkable relations amongtext units and real objects and topics, which arehidden in the texts.
For example, the word?willow?
seems having nothing to do with ?gettingapart?
by the semantic definitions, but in thecontext, ?breaking a willow branch?
does indicate?send-off friends?, or ?seeing a friend leaving?
inChinese Ancient Poetry.These meaningful entities and relations can belearned from the statistical analysis of large scalepoetry texts.
The use of computational linguisticsmethods here is crucial, which distinguishes it withtraditional Digital Museum models.
Statisticalnatural language processing over large scale corpusis the most significant approach we have adoptedin this research.3.1 Construction of Corpuses and IntegratedKnowledge basesThe first phase of language processing is to buildcorpora and knowledge bases.
Primitive corporaare constructed by archive digitalization.
Refinedcorpora are constructed by applying languageprocessors on the primitive corpus.
We can useDigital Museum of Chinese Ancient Poetry forexample.For the Digital Museum of Chinese AncientPoetry Art,  the primitive corpora include texts ofpoems over 1, 200, 000 lines, descriptions of 4000authors, a name dictionary and a locationdictionary.
The refined corpora include a wordsdictionary which is thoroughly discovered from thetexts, a concept base constructed by supervisedword clustering and a storage of wordscooccurances.
Other knowledge bases includeimages, music, medias(reading), relics, events, anda series of expertise knowledge on ChineseAncoent Poetry.The general ontology of domain knowledge wascarefully studied.
Important entities and relationsfrom texts and related domains were determined.Consequently, we carefully designed the metadataand chose a database system to maintain theknowledge base.
This knowledge base should beexpandable so that  it can contain texts, entitiesfrom related domains, and relations.The last step of this phase is to design anreferencing mechanism to query and get theanswer.
The outcome of this phase is an integratedknowledge base, the textual part of which is thecorpus for mining and knowledge discovery.3.2 Text Mining: Extracting Objects fromTextsAs soon as the corpora and knowledge bases areconstructed, higher level methods of naturallanguage processing are applied to mine in thecorpus.
The goal is to find objects abstracted fromtexts, which are organized by individual topics.Statistical natural language processing plays a veryimportant role in this procedure, which can bedescribed in the following three levels.3.2.1 Extracting Direct Relevant Objects fromTexts.Textual knowledge is not ?dead?
in the fields oflanguage and literature.
It is interacting withknowledge in other forms, by other carrier or onother abstract level.
Taking Chinese ancient poetryfor example, a poem is associated to its author, itsera and its writing background.
The textual body ofa poem also refers to certain persons, events,locations, plants, scenes, feelings and other entities,either real or virtual.
In addition, there are varioussources of objects relevant to the poem, such aspaintings, calligraphy works, music and culturalrelics, etc.
All these entities above are so importantto the synopsis of the poem that it is an advisableway to learn the poem with the appearance of theseobjects.
Furthermore, relying on these directlyrelevant objects makes teaching and learning muchmore open and exciting than barely focusing ontexts.In the early phase of Digital Museum design, anintegrated exhibition base is built, in which directlyrelevant entities of the texts are refined, stored inrelational or XML databases and associated withthe body of texts.3.2.2 Discovering Hidden Entities and RelationsAssociated with Language Units.As the Computer assisted research develops onthese fields, we can work on the hidden knowledgeof texts by means of text mining and retrieval.
Aslanguage technology evolves, a computational ageof language has arrived [1].
We can conductcomputer assisted analytical research on language,with both linguistic and statistical approaches.
Inthe research on the language of Chinese ancientpoetry, we studied the statistical concurrences andmeaningful units in the texts, extracted words fromcollocations and clustered words into meaningfulconcepts.
In further research, we explored ways tostudy the hidden meanings of the words andcollocations, especially those related to emotionsof human.
Consequently, expected to learnemotional characteristic of a poem, associatingwords, concepts and other units it refers with thesimilar characteristic.On the other hand, language and texts are themost important carriers of cultural fragments.Many interesting knowledge patterns are hidden inthe texts.
There is a considerable proportion ofChinese ancient history and culture buried in thetexts of Chinese ancient poetry, which evolutesalong more than 2,000 years and involves locationsall over China.
By language techniques, fragmentsof culture can be mined from the texts, refined andstored, and finally integrated into interactingvirtual scenes.By this we can discover hidden entities andrelations associated with text and expand it toanalytical meaningful segments.3.2.3 Expanding Indirect Relations.In our framework, knowledge entities are notliving alone but interacting.
Both textual entitiesand other objects are associated to its relevantentity set.
There are two kinds of relationsidentifying that two entities are interacting, directrelation, which have already been discussed above,and indirect relation.
For instance, a poem refersto various knowledge objects, thus poems referringto the same objects are indirectly interacting witheach other.
These poems are involved in theirrelevant entity set, with ?identical reference?
as anindirect relation.
In a more intelligent level, poemswith the similar hidden meanings or relevantemotions are arranged together as a set.
This setcan be associated with a topic, a subject, a scene ora specific semantic cluster.In these three approaches to expand textualknowledge into relevant objects, a former purelytextual entity has been developed as involving inthe surrounding of various relevant objects, real orvirtual.
Thus we complete the procedure ofextracting objects for exhibitions from texts.
Anexample from poems to objects is as follows:Figure2: Expanding Objects Set from a PoemText.3.3 Theme Driven Knowledge DiscoveryFrom the statistical analysis on characterconcurrences, we applied various methods todiscover unknown words from the texts.
Chineselanguage is different from other language becausethere isn?t natural interval from a word to another.We consider all words to be unknown in thebeginning and generate a word dictionary from thefiltering by mutual information value, m-test andother statistical methods.Upon the word dictionary, we conducted wordsclustering by the distance of words concurrencevectors.
This procedure has abstracted conceptsfrom words.
After supervised filtering, theseconcepts will indicate some hidden semanticmeanings.The consecutive knowledge discovery work willbe theme driven.
First, a theme, or a learning topicis decided, some features and key concepts of thistheme will be decided with the expert knowledge.Using statistical methods, we can find the conceptsand words which are semantically similar or insome way related to this theme.
Then, directly andindirectly related objects (discussed in section 3.2)will be associated with the topic.
Then, reluctantunits are eliminated.
We will filter the mostsignificant entities and relations, which can berepresented by combinations of both concepts andwords, and organize them around the theme.
In thisway, we can put the topic/theme back to its ancientliving environment.Further works includes rebuilding ancientscenarios where the topic belongs, and mining forrelations among topics.4 Knowledge Processing and Integration ofthe Digital MuseumKnowledge processing plays a very significantrole in the Digital Museum framework.
It isinvolved as a clue throughout the life cycle of thedigital museum.
The entire design andimplementing of the digital museum is focusing onlanguage processing, knowledge discovery andexhibition integrating.
The knowledge processingprocedures can be represented in the followingfigure:Figure3: Knowledge Processing in this digitalmuseum.4.1 Knowledge Processing HierarchyAn intelligent platform of knowledge deals withknowledge in five primary hierarchies, namely,knowledge citation, knowledge application,knowledge transmitting, knowledge learning andknowledge developing [8].
This division ofknowledge hierarchies remarkably adapts theneeds of an E-Learning program.
In the study ofthis article, we make a little modification to thisdivision and applied it to the Digital Museumsystem as follows:Knowledge CitationKnowledge ApplyingKnowledge LearningLearning and TeachingKnowledge MiningKnowledge RepresentingKnowledge Representing to UsersInformation InteractingKnowledge DevelopingTable 1: A knowledge processing hierachy in theDigital MuseumPoemPersons LocationsRelicsEventsOtherWords ConceptsEmotionsCulturalFragmentsScenesRelevant Entity Sets?Poems, Topics, Scenes,Texts, Concepts, Themes,Words, Other entities?TextsImages MediasVirtualRealitiesActually, this division is somewhat relative andnot absolute.
For instance, in some activitiesdefined as knowledge representation andknowledge developing, we may also need to doknowledge citation and applying.
However, thisdivision of knowledge hierarchy would help todefine the functions of Knowledge Platform andcontent the needs for knowledge by systems andusers.
[8]The Digital Museum presents multidimensionsaccording to the three functions of exhibition,education and research.
The processing targets,procedures and emphases on Knowledge varyamong dimensions.In the dimension of exhibition, system focuseson Knowledge citation and Knowledgerepresenting in the hierarchy above.In the dimension of e-learning, system focuseson the hierarchy of Knowledge applying, learningand teaching, Knowledge Representing andinformation interaction.In the dimension of computational linguisticsresearch, system emphasizes the hierarchy ofKnowledge Mining and Knowledge developing.4.2 Two Types of Integration for KnowledgeObjectsAfter discussing the generating of objects fromthe texts, we would be interested in how tointegrate them for E-Learning.Relating and interacting objects are extractedfrom texts and stored in the exhibition base.
Thenext phase is to arrange exhibitions by selecting,dividing and integrating these objects, andconstruct the digital museum interface.There are two key forms of objects integration,tutored and theme-oriented exhibitions and virtualscenarios.In the first form, tutored theme-orientedexhibition, objects relevant to a specific subject ortheme are integrated and represented in multi-modals.
This interface design provides a dynamicexhibition module by grouping texts and theirrelevant objects in various formats together,providing docent knowledge for this topic andlinks to relevant topic exhibitions.
Learnersparticipate in one exhibition and go through linksfitting to their needs or under instructions, thuspersonalized learning paths are formed.There are two tips in tutored theme-orientedexhibitions.
One is ?multi-modal?.
Personalizedexhibitions in our framework enable learningthrough multi channels, in forms of texts, image,music and virtual reality, etc.
Also taking Chineseancient poetry for example, we first discover therelevant scenes and hidden emotions of a poem,select objects referring to similar scenes andemotions, provide them as background materialsand then integrate them with the poem.
A moredetailed instance is the Auto-matching poems andpaintings.
The other is ?interactive?.
In ourframework, a learner can add his remarks ordiscuss in every exhibition topic.
These remarksare processed and stored as new relevant objects tothis topic.
Users can also provide materials orbackground information to an object or a topic, andcan provide their own exhibition plans of neworganizations of objects.
The system studies thefeedbacks and provides users with personalizedparticipation paths.The second integration form is scenarios.Knowledge objects were recorded in texts fromtheir original living environments.
By collectingand extracting relevant objects from texts andanalytical researching on their relevantenvironmental elements such as emotions, we areable to put a textual object back to a scenerepresenting its original living environment byrebuilding these origin scenes.
Teaching andlearning are made easier and more exciting withparticipating in the original scenes that a topicreally lived.
With the technology of multimediaand virtual reality, we are able to integrate objectsand environmental elements surrounding a specifictopic and rebuild a virtual scene, which isrepresented in our framework as multimediademonstration, tests and games.These two key integrating patterns organizevarious formats of objects and represent theseintegrated exhibitions to users in an interactive andpersonalized way.
It maximizes the educational useof a digital museum on language and literaturefields.Figure3:Integrating exhibits in the DigitalMuseum on Chinese Ancient Poetry.5 ConclusionComputer-based education on language andliterature has both its advantage and difficulty.
Onone hand it provides learners with abundantrelating materials, on the other hand it?s tediousand difficult for learners to acquire knowledge inthe sea of information.
The approach of extractingobjects from texts, and integrating them to build aninteractive and vivid exhibitions enables learnersboth to explore in broad scope of knowledge and toenjoy exciting and comprehensible learning.Computer techniques are adopted in the frameworkof Digital Museums to maximize its educationaluse.
How to make use of the methods fromcomputational linguistics, especially statisticalmethods is the bottleneck or the key to success ofthis e-learning approach.
On the other hand, theneeds of e-learning and the abstracting of digitalexhibitions from texts have very positive effect onpushing the research of computational linguistics.Significant techniques include unknown worddiscovery, clustering and other issues in textmining.
Besides the conituous work on text mining,future research will focus on how to personalizethe learning paths of learners, and enable in-timeprocessing of user feedbacks.
Investigations andevaluations will be made both on the e-learningsystem and the efficiency of text miningtechniques over typical kinds of texts, like Chineseancient poetry.6 AcknowledgementsThe authors would thank people in Institute ofComputational Linguistics, Peking University, whogave great help for this research.
