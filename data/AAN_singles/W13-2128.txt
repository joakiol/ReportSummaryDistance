NLG applica-tions in the medical domain have been var-ied but most are deployed in clinical situa-tions.
We develop a mobile device for pre-hospital care which receives streamed sen-sor data and user input, and converts theseinto a handover report for paramedics.1 IntroductionNatural Language Generation underlies many ap-plications in the medical domain but most are em-ployed under relatively predictable clinical situa-tions.
The MIME project employs a mobile de-vice with novel lightweight sensors to improvepre-hospital care service delivery.
The term pre-hospital care denotes the treatment delivered toa patient before they arrive at hospital.
Usu-ally this entails paramedics and ambulance teams,but it can also include a wide range of volun-tary and professional care groups.
Care for ru-ral pre-hospital patients can sometimes be car-ried out by volunteers from local communities:Community First Responders (CFR).
Their task isto assess patients, perform potentially life-savingfirst aid procedures and record medical observa-tions whilst the ambulance clinicians are en-route.These data are then handed over to the receiv-ing ambulance team upon arrival.
Because oftheir time-critical nature, handover reports are of-ten verbal and hence maybe incomplete or misun-derstood.MIME was inspired by the Babytalk BT-Nursesystem (Hunter et al 2012), which generates shifthandover reports for nurses in a neonatal intensivecare unit.
While BT-Nurse works with an exist-ing clinical record system, which does not alwaysAt 02:12, after RR remained fairlyconstant around 30 bpm for 4 minutes,high flow oxygen was applied, she tookher inhaler and RR decreased to 27bpm.
However, subsequently RR oncemore remained fairly constant around30 bpm for 8 minutes.At 02:15 she was feeling faint.At 02:15 the casualty was moved.At 02:17 the casualty was once moremoved.Figure 1: Part of the ?Treatment and Findings?
foran asthma scenario.record all actions and observations which ideallywould be included in a report, in MIME the elec-tronic record and user interface for acquiring ex-actly the desired information are effectively de-signed.
This simplifies the NLG task, at the costof adding a new task (interface construction).2 The MIME projectPre-hospital care is especially challenging becausethe environment in which it is delivered is inher-ently unpredictable.
The clinical condition of apatient may have improved or deteriorated sincethe original call for help.
The unpredictability ofthe environment at the scene of the call and theminimal level of clinical training of the CFRs con-tributes to the challenges presented to developersof a mobile device for this situation.
In particular,the continuous capture of physiological data intro-duces the problem that irrelevant material needsto be suppressed in order not to overload the am-bulance clinicians and hinder interpretation.
Thegenerated reports must provide a quick overviewof the situation but at the same time be compre-hensive.
It is also vital that the format must en-hance the readability, and the user-interface besimple and intuitive in order to avoid what has198Figure 2: First hardware prototype of the MIMEproject (GETAC Z710 tablet and Pulse Oxymetersensor).been termed ?creeping featurism?
(His and Potts,2000), whereby option saturation hinders task per-formance.In a user centred development process we estab-lished a structure for the handover reports.
Afterthe demographic description of the casualty (i.e.age and gender) and incident details that were re-layed to the CFR by the ambulance control centretwo elements of generated text follow, the initialassessment section and the treatment and findingssection.
The initial assessment contains informa-tion on the casualty that is gathered by the CFRsbefore the sensors are applied including baselineobservation during the first minute after the ap-plication of the sensors.
The treatment and find-ings section (Figure 1) is a report of the observa-tions and actions of the CFRs while they attendedthe casualty and waited for the ambulance to ar-rive.
This includes a paragraph that sums up thecondition of the patient at the time of handover.There are three types of events included in the re-port: discrete events (action and observation) andcontinuous events (trends in sensor readings).
Ac-tions (e.g.
applying oxygen) and observations (e.g.the patient feels faint) have to be entered by theCFR through an interface.
Continuous events arederived from the medical sensors: currently res-piratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and heartrate are recorded.
Since some events, especiallythose that deviate from the norm are more impor-tant than others (Hallett et al 2006), in the docu-ment planning stage we employ an algorithm thatdecides which events are mentioned in the reportand in which order.
This process is loosely basedon similar decision processes reported in (Hallettet al 2006) and (Portet et al 2007).3 Summary and ConclusionWe have developed a first prototype of the systemwhich uses simulated data to produce handover re-ports.
This runs on standard desktop PCs.
For oursecond prototype, which is currently being devel-oped, we port the NLG algorithm onto a GETACZ710 tablet1 which has been chosen for it?s robust-ness, capacitative touch screen, and long batterylife (Figure 2).
Our research also includes the es-tablishment of a connection between the tablet andsensors, the recording of the incoming data streamand the development of an interface for the tablet,which can be used by the CFR to enter observa-tions and actions taken or any other useful infor-mation.At the ENLG workshop we will present our firsthardware prototype alongside the desktop com-puter version, highlighting the challenges that theproject faces in developing a handover report gen-erator for pre-hospital care.4 AcknowledgmentsThis work is supported by the RCUK dot.ruralDigital Economy Research Hub, University of Ab-erdeen (Grant reference: EP/G066051/1)ReferencesC.
