The TTS-MUC4 system is our second full-scale prototype .
I tis an adaptation of the TTS-MUC3 system [1] [2], which constituted our first-full scale text skimming prototype .TTS-MUC3 utilized a previously-constructed text database facility and pattern matcher used for shallo wparsing.
Its modular process model integrated the results of case memory retrieval over sentences from multipl estories, extracting the date and location of incidents, and computing cross-reference information for various slots .One calendar month and approximately three (3) person months were spent developing TTS for MUC-3 .TTS-MUC3 demonstrated that a pattern classification approach was promising for performing tex tskimming .
TTS-MUC4 is similar to TTS-MUC3, with a few minor changes .
First, the K-Nearest Neighborclassifier used in TTS-MUC3 was replaced in TTS-MUC4 with a Bayesian Classifier which actually includesspecialized classifiers for each slot .
Therefore, for : INCIDENT-TYPE the set of features present in an entiresentence were used as features, but for :HUM-TGT-NAME the features just before and after a candidate were used .Secondly, in the new prototype, code was added to extract information to fill the new and revised slots of the MUC- 4templates .
Thirdly, additional filters were developed to improve the precision of the values of the template fillers .Like our rust prototype, TTS-MUC4 incorporates semi-automated lexicon generation and almost fully automate dphrase pattern generation .
Two calendar months and approximately 2.5 person months were spent on enhancing th eTTS-MUC3 system to create TTS-MUC4 .As with TTS-MUC3, all the modules in TTS-MUC4 are domain independent .
All the modules except thedate and location extraction modules are trained prior to skimming .
In addition, the location extraction modul erequires a location database, including the specification of which locations are contained within others .The goal of the TTS project is to develop a text skimmer that can be used in a variety of applications .
Byrelying on statistical information processing and keeping the amount of domain-dependent information to aminimum, it is hoped that this system can be easily ported to a variety of tasks, such as analysis of finance-relate dwire-service stories.THE TTS APPROACHThere are two aspects of TTS .
The first is system training, or the process of deriving or identifying th ephrases which are used in the training corpus .
The second is text skimming, or the process of skimming a tex twith the purpose of identifying whether the text falls into a specific category, and if so, extracting particular piecesof information from the text .
Figure 1 illustrates the key components of both aspects of Hughes Trainable Tex tSkimmer.
The training involves deriving the set of phrases used to generate the templates associated with aparticular corpus of texts, and the generation of training features which map features to the actual text in the stories .The text skimming involves the Text Database, databases containing derived phrases and training features, a Phrasa lParser, the Classifier, and a Feature-to-Template Process Model.189Figure 1: A block diagram of Hughes Trainable Text Skimmer.TTS Module DescriptionsThe training processor uses the provided templates to derive the phrase lexicon and build the featuresused by the pattern classifier.
Phrases are generated from the fillers for the template slots.
Features are generatedfrom the sentences that provided the fillers .
The word lexicon is generated by performing a word frequency analysi son the raw text.
In TTS-MUC4, all words that occur between 10 and 105 times are included in the lexicon .The text database contains: (1) the database of training stories, (2) the database of testing stories, (3) thedatabase of training templates for user browsing, and (4) the database of parsed templates for use during training .
Itsupports retrieval of a single fragment of text from a large collection of texts that may be spread over multiple dis kfiles.
The values retrieved from the text database fall into three categories .
A raw text string can be retrieved fo rprocessing a story or browsing templates.

In the third case, an s-expression representing a parsed template can beretrieved for further use by the pattern classifier .The phrasal parser is a fast, shallow, conceptual parser .
The parser accepts a token structure, a lexica lhierarchy, and a phrase-pattern set .
The parser returns an ordered list of text features .
A text feature includes: (1) amember of the concept hierarchy, (2) the string covered by the phrase, and (3) a recursive token structure spanningthe tokens covered by the phrase .Lexicon entries are created by adding word stems to a concept hierarchy as follows ,(ks :isa h-lex "PRIEST" :religious-individual-w )(ks :isa h-lex "MISSIONARY" :religious-individual-w )(ks :isa h-lex "CONFERENCE" :conference-w )(ks :isa h-lex "SUMMIT" :conference-w )(ks :isa h-lex "RECEPTION" :conference-w)Phrasal pattern definitions have three parts : the discrimination net to which the pattern belongs, a list of th epattern components, and the pattern descriptor .
Phrasal patterns may reference either elements of the concep thierarchy, or specific words .
Pattern definitions have the syntax illustrated in the following examples :(ph :defpattern (net ?
h-con )( :determiner :small-number :unidentified-w :human-group-w ):civilian )(ph :defpattern (net ?
h-con )( :civilian-w "FROM" :number-w :spanish-name-w "AREA" ):civilian )(ph :defpattern (net ?
h-con )( :public-w :communication-device-w :building-w ):communications )The features are extracted using a depth first search of the patterns, with a preference for patterns that havespecific words over those which have only concept names, as well as a preference for longer patterns .The pattern classifier actually consists of a separate pattern classifier for each template slot to be filled.Each such classifier takes an ordered list of text features, and returns the probability of a set fill or a string fill, base dupon all previously used fills for that particular slot.The feature-to-template process model has the task of identifying which features of the test text arerelevant to each template slot .
It also has the task of generating a completed story template for each relevant topi cidentified in the story .Flow of ControlOnce an initial training phase has been completed to initialize the pattern classifiers, the feature-to-templat eprocess model performs its task in four phases : (1) pattern classification, (2) topic grouping, (3) slot filling, and (4 )template generation .
During the first phase, TTS-MUC4 iterates over all sentences in the text and collects potentia ltopics .
The second phase consists of determining which topics are relevant, and eliminating from furthe rconsideration the sentences having no bearing on the chosen topics.
In phase 3, the values to be supplied in thecompleted template(s) are extracted and/or computed from the relevant sentences, based upon the focus of eac hselected topic .
Lastly, the standard MUC-4 templates are generated .Pattern ClassificationFor each sentence of a story, a set of Bayesian classifiers is used .
For set fills, the classifiers compute theprobabilities of the different potential set fills .
For string fills, the classifiers compute the probability that aparticular phrase is, for example, a human target .
(See the Site Report section of this volume for a detaileddescription of TTS-MUC4, including details on the Bayesian classifiers .
)19 1TopicGrouping and Relevance AssessmentTopic grouping (analogous to discourse processing) is based on the INCIDENT: TYPE slot .
The weigh tfor each type of incident is computed for every sentence .
The weights are then passed through a competitive filter ,resulting in binary signals.
The competitive filter first normalizes the topic weights using a Gaussian mask on asentence by sentence basis, then computes the best topic.
A topic is a set of contiguous sentences with the sam ecomputed value for INCIDENT: TYPE.Figure 2 shows the inputs and outputs to the topic grouping process .
Note that moderately high evidenc eof kidnapping throughout the story is suppressed in favor of the bombing interpretation, which turns out to b ecorrect.
This filter used is topic grouping is designed to pick out signals that are high but that "drop out" from timeto time, as one can see in the smoothing over the arson signal .Figure 2 : Input and output to topic grouping for TST-MUC3-0099 .Slot Fillin gSlot filling consists of five parts : (1) pure set fills, (2) string fills, (3) cross-referenced slots, (4) dat eextraction, and (5) location extraction .
The first three parts consider only relevant sentences.
A relevant sentenc eshares the same topic with the previous sentence or contains no competing topic .
There are two distinct types ofprocessing for slot filling.
Two slots, date and location, are filled by domain specific procedures.
The remainingslots are filled using hypotheses returned by the pattern classifier.
The slots are filled from the pattern classifier fallinto three categories:1.
Set fills?Pure set fills are computed by averaging the weights over all sentences fo ra given topic, and picking the highest score .2.
String fills?String fills are computed in a similar manner to set fills.
They differ inthat the suggestions returned by the classifier are subject to a threshold on th eweights.
For the official run of TTS-MUC4 the string fill threshold was set at 0 .75 .3.
Cross reference generation?Cross reference generation is performed by choosing th emost likely tag (as suggested by the classifier) for the sentence that contains th estring fill .For date extraction, all sentences within a topic are scanned for absolute or relative date references .Absolute date references are combined into a range .
Absolute dates are preferred over relative dates within a give nsentence.
Relative date references are interpreted with respect to either the current date specification for a story (if on ehas been found) or the story date line.192For location extraction, all sentences within a topic are scanned for known location names .
The resultinglist of location names is then searched for a maximal, legal, location containment chain .TST-MUC4-0048 ANALYSISA detailed look at the processing of TST-MUC4-0048 provides insight into TTS-MUC4 .
Upon reading th efirst sentence of TST-MUC4-0048 :SALVADORAN PRESIDENT-ELECT ALFREDO CRISTIANI CONDEMNED TH ETERRORIST KILLING OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCI AALVARADO AND ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATIO NFRONT (FMLN) OF THE CRIME .TTS-MUC4 extracts the following features :(feature((feature((feature((feature((feature((feature((feature((feature((feature((feature((feature((feature((featureof-country-w "SALVADORAN"#<token :SALVADORAN>) ):politician-w "PRESIDENT "#<token :PRESIDENT>) )elect-w "ELECT"#<token :ELECT>) ):spanish-name "ALFREDO CRISTIANI "#<token-spanish-name>) )condemn-w "CONDEMNED "#<token :CONDEMNED>) ):terrorist-act-indiv "THE TERRORIST "#<token-terrorist-act-indiv>) ):death-w "KILLING"#<token :KILLING>) )government-official-or-legal-or-judicial-desc r"ATTORNEY GENERAL"#<token-government-official-or-legal-or-judicial-descr>) ):spanish-name "ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO "#<token-spanish-name>) )doubt-l-w "ACCUSED"#<token :ACCUSED>) )terrorist-act-org"THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) "#<token-terrorist-act-org>) ):crime-w "CRIME" #<token :CRIME>)) )TTS-MUC4 identifies each potentially relevant template slot, and hypothesizes possible values, based upo nsimilar sentences which TTS-MUC4 has retrieved from case memory .
In this case, for example, the system choose s: attack as the most likely : incident-type, based upon the following calculated likelihoods for each topi cassociated with the first sentence of -0048 :( :incident-type(:attack .
0 .9828392566462706)( :robbery .
0 .0)( :kidnapping .
0 .0)( :bombing .
5 .191340765556957E-4 )( :arson .
0 .0) )Similar likelihoods are calculated for each sentence.Based on semantic features such as :death-w, :government-official-or-legal-or-judicial-descr, and : terrorist-act-org, the Bayesian classifier for INCIDENT-TYPE computes theprobabilities above .
Likewise, using features such as :death-w and : terrorist-act-org, another Bayesianclassifier computes the probability that "ROBERTO GARCIA ALVARADO" is a human target .193Processing proceeds in a like manner for the next 6 sentences of the story, and the template shown in figur e3 is produced.0 .

TTS-MUC4 correctly identifies onehuman target and one physical target, but one other person, JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE, and several coreferentsare also generated.Sentences 11 through 13 of TST-MUC4-0048 :GUERRILLAS ATTACKED MERINO'S HOME IN SAN SALVADOR 5 DAYS AGOWITH EXPLOSIVES .
THERE WERE SEVEN CHILDREN, INCLUDING FOUROF THE VICE PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN, IN THE HOME AT THE TIME .A 15-YEAR-OLD NIECE OF MERINO'S WAS INJURED .along with the preceding 2 sentences and the subsequent sentence 14, produce the template shown in figure 4 .194Figure 4: Template produced for TST-MUC4-0048 sentences 9-14.The most notable feature of these template fills is the fragmentation of the string fills .
Many of the correc tfeatures are tagged, but, because TTS only has a shallow parser, the phrases : "CHILDREN" and "v IC EPRESIDENT' S" are never combined into the correct answer "VICE PRES IDENT' S CHILDREN .
"In addition to the two templates above, TTS-MUC4 also produces a spurious template based on th esentences 21 through 22 :ACCORDING TO THE POLICE AND GARCIA ALVARADO'S DRIVER, WH OESCAPED UNSCATHED, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS TRAVELING WIT HTWO BODYGUARDS .
ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED .and the subsequent 3 sentences .
The template produced is not spurious, in a sense, because it describes the sam eincident as template 1 .
However, because TTS-MUC4 does not have a full discourse processing component, the tw otemplates are not combined .O .

Figure 5 shows these dependencies.
Each module points to the modules upon which i tdepends.
We contend that improving a module will enable improvement of the behavior of its dependents .Figure 5 : Module dependency graph .For example, in tuning the system parameter, the pattern classifier for each slot was adjusted to balanc erecall and performance.
In every case, adjusting that parameter to optimize the pattern classification resulted i nincreased performance of the overall system .REFERENCE S[1] Dolan, Charles P., Goldman, Seth R ., Cuda, Thomas V., Nakamura, Alan M .
