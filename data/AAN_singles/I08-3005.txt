This common conceptincreases topic of interest in many sciencesincluding computer science where com-puters are bring about as group supportelements.
This paper presents a new plat-form, called Knowledge Unifying Initiator(KUI) for knowledge development whichenables connection and collaborationamong individual intelligence in order toaccomplish a complex mission.
KUI is aplatform to unify the various thoughts fol-lowing the process of thinking, i.e., initiat-ing the topic of interest, collecting theopinions to the selected topics, localizingthe opinions through the translation or cus-tomization and posting for public hearingto conceptualize the knowledge.
The proc-ess of thinking is done under the selectionalpreference simulated by voting mechanismin case that many alternatives occur.
Bymeasuring the history of participation ofeach member, KUI adaptively manages thereliability of each member?s opinion andvote according to the estimated Ex-pertScore.1 IntroductionThe Internet is a must for forming an online com-munity in the present day.
Many tools have beendeveloped to support such an online communitywork.
For instance, SourceForge.net (http://www.sourceforge.net) facilitates project based OpenSource software development.
Open Source soft-ware developers deploy SourceForge.net to an-nounce their initiation, to call for participation, todistribute their works and to receive feedbacks.SourceForge.net is said to be the largest OpenSource software development community.Wiki.org (http://www.wiki.org) facilitates a data-base for creating and editing Web page content.
Itkeeps the history of the online editing works whichallows multiple authoring.
Wiki is especially de-rived for several online collaborative works suchas wikipedia, wikitionary, wikibooks, etc.
In addi-tion, PhpWiki is one of the derived works of wikias a handy software tool for managing the organ-izational documentation.
This collaborative work-ing environment has changed our working style toa more efficient manner.
In the same time, theflood of information under the open collaborativeworks is now challenging us for an efficient man-agement system.
The disorder of the informationcauses difficulties in the requirement of the sys-tematic maintenance for retrieval, extraction, oreven summarization from the stored information.To understand the intention of an article (or a solu-tion), we not only rely on the trace or the history ofediting, but we also constantly recall the back-ground of our decision in producing the article (orthe solution).Why don't we organize the information in thedevelopment process beforehand rather than limit-ing our capability in making use of the un-structured information?
Google (http://www.google.com) successfully responds our needs inlooking for documents from the WWW.
However,the results from the search can simply over a mil-lion sites and just some tens out of which are13viewed for the search.
This most powerful search-ing tool does not digest the information to meetfinal our requirement.
It only thoroughly shows theresults of the related document.Back to the principle of collective intelligent(Smith, 1994; Johnson et al, 1998; Levy, 1997) inwhich ?two minds are better than one?, mountainsof knowledge are contributed by this internetcommunity.
But the most intelligence is the intelli-gence of knowledge connections in which newtechnologies can take part in helping individuals tothink and develop their concept collectively.We proposed and developed KUI (KnowledgeUnifying Initiator) (KUI, 2006; Sornlertlamvanich,2006) to be a Knowledge User Interface (KUI) foronline collaborative work to help community tothink and to develop things together.
KUI is a plat-form to unify the various thoughts following theprocess of thinking, i.e., initiating the topic of in-terest, collecting the opinions to the selected top-ics, localizing the opinions through the translationor customization and finally posting for publichearing to conceptualize the knowledge.
The proc-ess of thinking is done under the selectional prefer-ence simulated by voting mechanism in case thatmany alternatives occur.2 Collaborative tool for managing collec-tive intelligenceWe developed KUI (Knowledge Unifying Initia-tor) for being a knowledge development supportingtool of a web community.
Actually, KUI is a plat-form to unify various thoughts created by follow-ing process of thinking, i.e., (1) new task, to allowa participant to initiate a task, (2) opinion, to allowa participant to post his own opinion, (3) localiza-tion, to allow a participant to bring in a newknowledge into the community by translation, and(4) public-hearing, to allow a participant to post adraft of concept for conceptualizing the knowl-edge.
The process of thinking is done under theselectional preference simulated by voting mecha-nism in case that many alternatives occur.In this section, we describe the concept behindKUI, the knowledge development process, and thefeatures in KUI.2.1 What is KUI?KUI or Knowledge Unifying Initiator is a GUI forknowledge engineering, in other words KnowledgeUser Interface (KUI).
It provides a web interfaceaccessible for pre-registered members only for theaccountability reason.
An online registration is of-fered to manage the account by profiling the loginparticipant in making contribution to the commu-nity.
A contributor can comfortably move aroundin the virtual space from desk to desk to participatein a particular task.
A login member will be as-signed to a desk when a participation task is de-fined.
Members can then participate in the chatgroup of the same desk.
A desk functions as ameeting place for collaborative work that needssome discussion through the chat function, or al-low a contributor to work individually by using themessage slot to record each own opinion.
Theworking space can be expanded by closing the un-necessary frames so that the contributor can con-centrate on a particular task.
All working topicscan also be statistically viewed through the pro-vided tabs.
These tabs help contributors to under-stand KUI in the aspects of the current status ofcontribution and the available tasks.
A web com-munity can be formed to create a domain specificknowledge efficiently through the features pro-vided by KUI.
These KUI features fulfill the proc-ess of human thought to record the knowledge.In addition, KUI also provides a KUI look upfunction for viewing the composed knowledge.
Itis equipped with a powerful search and statisticalbrowse in many aspects.
Moreover, the chat log isprovided to learn about the intention of the knowl-edge composers.
We frequently want to knowabout the background of the solution for better un-derstanding or to remind us about the decision, butwe cannot find one.
To avoid the repetition of amistake, we systematically provide the chat log tokeep the trace of discussion or the comments toshow the intention of knowledge composers.2.2 Knowledge Development in KUIAdopting the concept of Open Source softwaredevelopment, we will be possibly able to develop aframework for domain specific knowledge devel-opment under the web community environment.Sharing and collaboration are the considerable fea-tures of the framework.
The knowledge will befinally shared among the communities by receivingthe consensus from the participants in each step.To facilitate the knowledge development, the proc-ess is deliberated into four steps (Sornlertlam-vanich, 2006).14New TaskA new task (Topic of interest) can be posted todraw intention from participants.
The only selectedtasks by a major vote will then be proceed for fur-ther discussion in the requested type of task i.e.,Opinion Poll, Localization or Public-Hearing.Figure 1.
Process of knowledge developmentOpinion PollThe selected task is posted to call for opinionsfrom the participants in this step.
Opinion poll isconducted to get the population of each opinion.The result of the opinion poll provides the varietyof opinions that reflects the current thought of thecommunities together with the consensus to theopinions.LocalizationTranslation is a straightforward implementation ofthe localization.
Collaborative translation helpsproducing the knowledge in multiple languages inthe most efficient way.
Multi-lingual texts are gen-erated in this type of task.Public-HearingThe result of discussion will be revised and con-firmed by gathering the opinions to develop thefinal draft of the proposal.
Suggestions for revisionare ranked according to the vote.
The author mayconsider the weight of suggestion to make decisionon the final revision.The developed knowledge is started from post-ing 'New Task', participants express their supportsby casting a vote.
Upon a threshold the    'NewTask' is selected for conducting a poll on 'Opinion',or introducing to the community by  'Localization',or posting a draft for 'Public-Hearing' to gatherfeedbacks from the community.
The transitionfrom 'Opinion' to either 'Localization' or 'Public-Hearing' occurs when the 'Opinion' has a concreteview for implementation.
The discussion in 'Local-ization' and 'Public-Hearing' is however inter-changeable due to purpose of implementationwhether to adopt the knowledge to the local com-munity or to get feedbacks from the community.The knowledge creating is managed in 4 differ-ent categories corresponding to the stage of knowl-edge.
Each individual in the community casts avote to rank the appropriateness of solutions ateach category.
The community can then form thecommunity knowledge under the 'Selectional Pref-erence' background.TopicofInterestLocalizationOpinionPublic Hear-ing2.3 Features in KUIThese KUI features fulfill the process of hu-man thought to record the knowledge.Poll-based Opinion or Public-HearingA contributor may choose to work individually byposting an opinion e.g.
localization, suggestionetc., or join a discussion desk to conduct 'Public-Hearing' with others on the selected topic.
The dis-cussion can be conducted via the provided 'Chat'frame before concluding an opinion.
Any opinionsor suggestions are committed to voting.
Opinionscan be different but majority votes will cast thebelief of the community.
These features naturallyrealize the online collaborative works to create theknowledge.Individual or Group WorkThought may be formed individually or though aconcentrated discussion.
KUI facilitates a windowfor submitting an opinion and another window forsubmitting a chat message.
Each suggestion can becast through the 'Opinion' window marked with adegree of its confidence.
By working individually,comments to a suggestion can be posted to mark itsbackground to make it more understanding.
On theother hand, when working as a group, discussionsamong the group participants will be recorded.
Thediscussion can be resumed at any points to avoidthe iterating words.Record of IntentionThe intention of each opinion can be reminded bythe recorded comments or the trace of discussions.Frequently, we have to discuss again and again onthe result that we have already agreed.
Misinterpre-15tation of the previous decision is also frequentlyfaced when we do not record the background ofdecision.
Record of intention is therefore necessaryin the process of knowledge creation.
The knowl-edge interpretation also refers to the record of in-tention to obtain a better understanding.Selectional PreferenceOpinions can be differed from person to persondepending on the aspects of the problem.
It is notalways necessary to say what is right or what iswrong.
Each opinion should be treated as a resultof intelligent activity.
However, the majority ac-cepted opinions are preferred at the moment.
Ex-periences could tell the preference via vote casting.The dynamically vote ranking will tell the selec-tional preference of the community at each mo-ment3 KUI for Collective Intelligent Develop-mentRelated to the principle of KUI and its features,KUI provide many collaborative tools or applica-tion as followings.TranslatingTranslating is a type of text for language expertgroup contribution.
Since the existing knowledgein one language is invaluable to other languagecommunities.
Translating such knowledge willhelp bridging the different language communities.It will also bring the individual to an unlimited in-formation space beyond the language barrier.
Con-tribution in term and phrase translation is to createa multi-lingual terminology and an aligned multi-lingual corpus.KUI-Translating Room facilitates an individualto view either the current translation tasks in thetask list or the discussion forum of each translatingtask.
Online lookup is also provided to consult aterm translation.Individual participated in KUI-Translating cancast a vote for a new task, a vote for multiple tasksis allowed, select a topic to participate in the dis-cussion forum, translate the existing terms intoyour own language, chat with your friends to findthe best translation, cast a vote to your favoritetranslation, invite assistants to your own initiatedprivate task, and propose a new task for commu-nity voting as well.PollingOpinion Poll is conducted for getting the popula-tion of each opinion.
The result of the opinion pollshows the variety of opinions that reflects the cur-rent thought of the communities together with theconsensus to the opinions.Similar to KUI-Translating, an individual canview the current polling task in the task list as wellas the discussion forum of each polling task viaKUI-Polling.
And current result of polling can beview via online lookup function.Public-HearingPublic Hearing is a way to make a complete docu-ment from the draft.
The result from discussionwill be received and confirmed by gathering theopinions to reflect in the final document.
Voting ofthe opinion will help the author to select the ap-propriate opinion of the community.An individual can view the current public hear-ing tasks in the task list as well as the discussionforum of each public hearing task via KUI-Polling.And current result of polling can be view viaonline lookup function.Figure 2.
KUI-Translating pageWritingWriting your document online will keep yourdocument in access anywhere and anytime.
Indi-vidual does not have to carry all the documentswith him/her.
Only online, one can work on it.Sharing the editing online will also support thecollaborative work.16With KUI-Writing, individual can create or im-port a new document, edit the existing document,chat with friends about the document, and save orexport the document.Correspondent to other collaborative tools, all ofKUI-application provides function to cast a votefor either a new task or multiple tasks.
Individualcan select a topic to participate or post new topic,chat with others, invite assistants to his/her owninitiated task, and so on.The majority vote will select the best solutionfor the collaborative task.4 ExpertScoreKUI heavily depends on members?
voting score toproduce a reliable result.
Therefore, we introducean adjustable voting score to realize a self-organizing system.
Each member is initially pro-vided a default value of voting score equals to one.The voting score is increased according to Ex-pertScore which is estimated by the value of Ex-pertise, Contribution, and Continuity of the par-ticipation history of each member.
Expertise is acomposite score of the accuracy of opinion andvote, as shown in Equation 1.
Contribution is acomposite score of the ratio of opinion and voteposting comparing to the total, as shown in Equa-tion 2.
Continuity is a regressive function based onthe assumption that the absence of participation ofa member will gradually decrease its ExpertScoreto one after a year (365 days) of the absence, asshown in Equation 3.)3(3651)2()()()()()1()()()()(4????????=+=+=??????????????????DContinuityTotalVotecountVotecountonTotalOpinicountOpinioncountonContributiVotecountBestVotecountOpinioncountnBestOpiniocountExpertise???

(4)The value of ExperScore is ranged between 1 to365 according to the accuracy and the rate of con-tribution of each member.
This means that reliablemembers are rewarded better score for each vote.However, the expertise of the member is decreasedaccording to the continuity of the participation.
Bymeans of the ExpertScore, we can rank the opin-ions precisely and yield reliable results, especiallyfor the results produced by an online community.Figure 3.
KUI-Polling page5 Application Show CaseKUI for Collaborative Translation TaskIn this collaborative text translation, individualparticipants of different mother language workonline as a virtual group by using KUI.
There areseveral translation task required the collaborativetranslation such as Asian WordNet (originally fromWordNet (Miller, 1995; http://wordnet.
prince-ton.edu/), Medical Translation, OSS Glossary andso on.
And some are ready for individual use forexample NICT?s Japanese ?
English News ArticlesAlignment, Open Office Glossary, Swadesh List,Technical Term Dictionary.The volunteer participants are to translate theEnglish text into their native languages, by usingKUI.
They act as a virtual group and participate inthe translation via this web interface.
With differ-ent backgrounds and degrees of translation abili-ties, they, therefore, can discuss or exchange theiropinion while translating each utterance.
The17communication is not only for getting to knoweach other, but also for better understanding of theutterance before translation.
Figure 4 shows theparticipation work flow.Figure 4.

Lookup page of Asian WordNet6 ConclusionWe proposed an efficient online collaborativeframework in producing and maintaining knowl-edge according to the principle of collective intel-ligent.
KUI was designed to support an open webcommunity by introducing a voting system and amechanism to realize the function of selectionalpreference.
It was efficiently introduced to encour-age the communication among individuals fromdifferent background.
KUI was also proved to sup-port the collaborative work in producing manykinds of tasks.
The translated text, an example, willbe voluntarily maintained by the online partici-pants under the selectional preference based on thevoting function.
Correspondent to collective intel-ligent collaborative tool, KUI enables to connectand collaborate among individual intelligence inorder to accomplish a complex mission.
