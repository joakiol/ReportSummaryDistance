Language Technology for Closely Related Languages and Language Variants (LT4CloseLang), page 1,October 29, 2014, Doha, Qatar.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsComputational Processing of Arabic Dialects(invited talk)Nizar HabashComputer Science DepartmentNew York University Abu Dhabinizar.habash@nyu.edu1 AbstractThe Arabic language is a collection of variantsamong which Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) hasa special status as the formal written standard ofthe media, culture and education across the ArabWorld.
The other variants are informal spokendialects that are the media of communication fordaily life.
As expected, most of the natural lan-guage processing resources and research in Ara-bic focuses on MSA.
However, there is more worknow on Arabic dialects, which includes effortsto build resources as well as exploit existing re-sources from MSA.
In this talk, we present thechallenges of processing Arabic dialects and thecurrent advances in that area, with special empha-sis on directions that exploit existing MSA (andother dialect) resources.2 Author?s BiographyNizar Habash is an Associate Professor of Com-puter Science at New York University Abu Dhabi.He received his Ph.D. in 2003 from the Com-puter Science Department, University of Mary-land College Park.
He later joined Columbia Uni-versity?s Center for Computational Learning Sys-tems where he co-founded in 2005 the ColumbiaArabic Dialect Modeling group (CADIM) withMona Diab and Owen Rambow.
His research in-cludes work on machine translation, morpholog-ical analysis, generation and disambiguation, andcomputational modeling of Arabic and its dialects.Professor Habash has over 100 publications in-cluding a book entitled ?Introduction to ArabicNatural Language Processing?.
