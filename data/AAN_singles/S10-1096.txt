This HR-WSD system delivered the best perfor-mance (55.9%) among all Chinese sys-tems in SemEval-2010 Task 17: All-wordsWSD on a specific domain.1 IntroductionWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is essentialfor language understanding systems such as in-formation retrieval, summarization, and machinetranslation systems (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Schutzeand Pedersen, 1995; Ng and Zelle, 1997).
In par-ticular due to the rapid development of other is-sues in computational linguistics, WSD has beenconsidered the next important task to be solved.Among various WSD tasks, the lexical sampletask can achieve a precision rate more than 70%in Chinese, so can the all-words task in English,but currently no Chinese all-words WSD system isavailable.
This study proposes an all-words WSDsystem conducted on a specific domain which canachieve a 55.9% precision rate.This system makes use of certain characteristicsof WordNet.
First, the sense inventory in ChineseWordNet is ordered by the ?prototypicality?
of thewords.
In other words, the first sense of a wordwith multiple senses will be the prototype mean-ing of that word.
In addition to semantic relationsand sense definitions, Chinese WordNet alo in-cludes sense axes which indicate the relations be-tween Chinese senses and corresponding Englishsenses.2 Proposed ApproachTwo heuristic rules are devised to characterizedomain texts: In a domain text, domain sensesare more likely to occur in words if they have one(Heuristic Rule 1); on the other hand, for wordswith no domain senses, the most generic usages(prototype senses) are more likely to be adopted(Heuristic Rule 2).
Therefore, as proposed byLi et al(1995) for the WordNet-based domain-independent texts WSD task, two heuristic rules(HR) are taken into consideration in the domainWSD test:for all senses skof w doif w has domain sensechoose domain sense skelsechoose prototype sense s1endFigure 1: Heuristic Rules based WSDBesides, sense definitions from WordNetwere also tested with simplified Lesk algorithm(Lesk, 1986; Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000)in another experiment to examine the effect ofconsidering sense definitions in domain WSD:for all senses skof w doif w has domain sensechoose domain sense skelseif Dkoverlaps with C:choose sense skwith Dkthat overlaps the mostelse:choose prototype sense s1endFigure 2: HR with simplified Lesk Algorithm.Dkis the set of content words occurring in the dic-tionary definition of sense sk.
C is the set of con-tent words in the context.4333 ProceduresBefore the test only preprocessing including seg-mentation and parts of speech tagging will beapplied to the target texts, in order to eliminatethose senses of the same word form in other partsof speech; the background documents providedby SemEval-2010 are not used for training sincethis is not a supervised system.
According toWang (2002), with preprocessing of PoS taggingalone, 20% of word sense ambiguity can be distin-guished.Since the current number of semantic relationsin Chinese WordNet is still less than that in En-glish WordNet (PWN), to detect domain senses,the sense axes in Chinese WordNet are exploited.By seeding with English words such as ?environ-ment?
and ?ecology,?
all English words related tothese seed words can be captured with the help ofthe semantic relations in Princeton WordNet.
Bymapping these environment-related English wordsto Chinese words with any kind of semantic rela-tions in the sense axes, the corresponding Chinesedomain senses can be identified.Therefore, the HR-WSD system will first con-sider any domain senses for the words to be dis-ambiguated; if there is no such sense, the proto-type sense will be adopted.
Another test wheresense definitions from WordNet are considered tofacilitate HR-based disambiguation was also con-ducted.4 EvaluationThe results were evaluated according to three man-ually tagged documents in SemEval-2010 Task17: All-words WSD on a Specific domain (Agirreet al, 2010).
The most frequent sense baseline(MFS) refers to the first sense in WordNet lexicalmarkup framework (In Chinese WordNet sensesare ordered according to annotations in hand-labelled corpora).
In these tagged domain texts,only nouns and verbs (two major types of contentwords) as a single word are disambiguated.
There-fore, in this system only these two kinds of wordswill be tagged with senses.
Adjectives, adverbs, orwords in multiple forms (e.g., idioms and phrases)are not considered, in order to simplify the test andobserve the results more clearly.5 ResultsBy observing that the HR-WSD system* (Rank1) outperformed other systems and was closest toRank Precision RecallMFS 0.562 0.5621* 0.559 0.5592** 0.517 0.5173 0.342 0.2854 0.322 0.296Random 0.32 0.325 0.310 0.258Table 1: Results.the MFS performance we can infer that HeuristicRule 2 works.
However, since this system perfor-mance is still worse than MFS, it may indicate thatHeuristic Rule 1 does not work well, or even de-creases the system performance, so the mechanismto detect domain senses needs to be refined.
Be-sides, the inclusion of simplified Lesk algorithm**did not perform better than the original HR-WSDsystem, further investigation such as more fine-grained definition can be expected.6 Discussion and Future DevelopmentAlthough PoS tagging may help filter out sensesfrom other parts of speech of the same word form,incorrect PoS tagging will lead to incorrect sensetagging, which did happen in the HR-WSD sys-tem, in particular when there is more than one pos-sible PoS tag for the word.
For instance, ?nuan-hua?
in ?quan-qiu nuan-hua?
(global warming) ismanually tagged with a verbal sense in the answerkey from SemEval-2010, but tagged as a nounin the pre-processing stage of the HR-WSD sys-tem.
The difference between manual tagged textsand automatic tagged texts should be examined,or consider allowing more than one PoS tag for aword, or even no PoS pre-processing at all.To disambiguate with the help of gloss defini-tion, gloss words of the polysemous word musthave direct overlapping with that of its contextword, which does not always occur.
To solve thisproblem, we may expand gloss words to relatedwords such as hyponyms, hypernyms, meronyms,or the gloss definition of the current gloss words.Apart from nouns and verbs, if function wordsand other kinds of content words such as adjec-tives and adverbs are to be disambiguated, the per-formance of the current WSD system needs to bere-examined.As mentioned in the beginning, WSD is an es-sential part in language understanding systems.434With this Chinese WSD program, informationretrieval, summarization, or machine translationtasks would be more plausible.
The proposedheuristic rules may also work for other languageswith similar WordNet resources.
Besides, this sys-tem was currently tested on three texts from theenvironment domain only.
It can be expected thatthis Chinese WSD can work on texts of other do-mains.ReferencesAdam Kilgarriff and Joseph Rosenzweig.
