University Dr.Edinburg, Tx 78539tomaie@utpa.eduAbstractThis paper examines the efficacy of the appli-cation of a pre-existing technique in the areaof event-event temporal relationship identifi-cation.
We attempt to both reproduce the re-sults of said technique, as well as extend theprevious work with application to a newly-created domain of biographical data.
We findthat initially the simpler feature sets performas expected, but that the final improvement tothe feature set underperforms.
In response, weprovide an analysis of the individual featuresand identify differences existing between twocorpora.1 IntroductionAs natural language systems continue to grow,so too does the importance of extracting temporalinformation from text.
Narratives often contain awealth of temporal information, linking specificevents to each other and to individual named enti-ties of importance, but such information is oftenimplicitly conveyed, rather than explicitly stated.The continued interest in Question Answering andother data extraction systems has emphasized theneed to better understand these relations to movepast superficial understanding to a level of deepercomprehension.
For native speakers, the temporalclues hidden in the text are relatively simple tocomprehend.
However, even for human annotators,the task of identifying and classifying the specificrelationship between two events can be problemat-ic.
This complexity, of course, only exacerbates theproblem of trying to automate the process for anyinformation extraction system.The creation of the TimeBank Corpus(Pustejovsky et al2003a), a fully-annotatednewswire domain, opened up the possibility of ap-plying machine learning techniques to the task ofautomatically extracting temporal relations.
Welook to the standards of the TimeBank Corpus tocreate a corpus of biographical accounts, and applytechniques that have been shown to work onTimeBank to the new domain.2 Related WorkDomain-independent approaches have oftenfocused on events that can be bound to a globaltimeline (Mani et al2003).
This includes dates andtimes, but often neglects phrases that indicateevents occurring in relative time (e.g.
?duringschool,?
?before the crash,?
or ?recently?).
Re-search conducted on news articles attempted toidentify the specific temporal relationships be-tween two events, as seen in (Mani et al2006).Further work in that domain extended this start byidentifying additional features that better predictedthose temporal relations.
(Lapata & Lascarides2007; Chambers et al2007).In this work, we are primarily interested inapplying event ordering techniques to documentsless structured than news articles, specifically bi-ographies.
It is the intention of our work to validatethe efficacy of previous techniques in a differentdomain, and thus we attempt to extend the workcompleted by Chambers et alhrough applicationto a newly created corpus of biographical data.
Inthe previous work, Chambers reports best results of59.43% accuracy with gold standard features onTimeBank.
We attempt to reproduce these results,and also adopt the policy of including incrementalresults against features selected based on the work529of Mani et al2006), and Lapata & Lascarides(2007).3 DataFor purposes of validation of our implementa-tion, we adopt the use of the TimeBank corpus(v1.1), which consists of 186 newswire documentsand 3,406 identified event pairs with temporal rela-tionships.
The number of identified event pairsdiffers slightly from the previous work, which re-ports only 3,345.
We cannot account for this dis-crepancy.Furthermore, we oversee the creation of theBio Corpus, consisting of 17 biographical accountsand annotated with 1,594 event pairs.
Despite thesmall size of the corpus, we feel that the greatlyincreased event relationship density of our samplescompared to a similar number of TimeBank docu-ments offsets the disadvantage of the small docu-ment count.The accounts are drawn from those available atBiography.com, and describe multiple aspects ofthe subject?s life.
Because the style of the biog-raphies tends to explore one aspect of life fully,before moving on to another, we frequently seereferences to events contained in previous sections.These relations, which are not only across sentenceboundaries but often in entirely different para-graphs, are one of the most striking differencesbetween TimeBank documents and those of thenew corpus.To prepare the corpus, each document was au-tomatically event tagged through the adoption ofEVITA, the Events in Text Analyzer (Sauri et al2005).
EVITA was previously found to performwith 80.12% accuracy, a result comparable to theaccuracy of graduate student annotators with basictraining.
The temporal relations between eventpairs were then hand-annotated according to theTimeML standard (Pustejovsky et al2003b).4 MethodologyIn an attempt to reproduce the event relation-ship classification techniques of the previous work,we first implement the approach and test it on ourversion of the TimeBank corpus.
We then demon-strate that the validated techniques are applicableto the biographical domain, and that where dis-crepancies do occur, the specific feature set can bemodified to elicit improvements not seen in theTimeBank data.
In all possible cases we utilize thesame techniques and tools as the earlier work, ex-cept where sufficient information is lacking, suchas in the specific implementation of the machinelearning techniques.
In such situations, assump-tions are made as deemed necessary.Chambers?
work attempts to identify the rela-tionships between event pairs according to a previ-ously defined set consisting of Before, iBefore,Includes, Begins, Ends, and Simultaneous.
The setof event pairs are pre-selected and chosen forpreexisting relationships, so a classification of NoRelation is not required.
In order to achieve classi-fication, a support vector machine (SVM) is im-plemented via the Library for Support VectorMachines (Chang & Lin, 2011) and is trained onan extensive set of thirty-five features, as detailedbelow.Table 1.
Features of classification at each stage.The feature set was incrementally built by anumber of previous experiments, as detailed inTable 1, above.
Initially, five temporal attributesoriginally identified by TimeML as having tem-poral significance, are adopted.
These include thetense, aspect, and class of each event, as well asthe modality and polarity of each.
However, perthe previous work, which demonstrated modalityand polarity performing with high majority base-lines, we exclude them from consideration.
WhileChambers et alnclude the task of automating theidentification of these features, we report resultsversus the gold standards taken from TimeBank.Mani et al2006) added features indicating anagreement between the two events in the case oftense and aspect, and Chambers extends this toinclude a class agreement variable.
In addition tosimple agreement, bigrams of tense, aspect, andclass are first included by Chambers to more fullyrepresent the relationship between the event attrib-utes (e.g.
"Past Present," "Perfect Prog").Next to be included are the event strings them-selves, extracted verbatim, and the corresponding(1) Mani Tense, Aspect, Class, Tense_Agree,Aspect_Agree, Event Words(2) Lapata Subord., Before, Synsets, Lemmas(3) Chambers POS, Class_Agree, Temporal Bi-grams, Dominance, Prepositions,Same_Sentence530Baseline Mani Lapata ChambersTimeBank ?

Includes all features attributed to Mani and Lapata.Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998) synsets and lemmas.Also included are the parts-of-speech for bothevent words, the two words immediately precedingeach event, and that of the token immediately fol-lowing the events.
Bigrams for part-of-speech fromeach event and its preceding token are also includ-ed, as well as a bigram for the part-of-speech of thetwo events as related to each other.Lapata and Lascarides (2006) first added a fea-ture indicating whether or not two events were in asubordinate relationship, which Chambers' in-cludes, and extends it with the addition of one in-dicating a dominating relationship.
Thisinformation is extracted by considering the parsetree as defined by an intermediate stage of theStanford Parser.
Similar to these two linguistic or-dering features, we include another feature indicat-ing the textual ordering of the two events (true ifEvent 1 is before Event 2, and false if not), and oneindicating whether the two events are intra- or in-ter- sentential (same sentence or different sentenc-es).
Finally, we adopt Chambers' use of a featurefor identifying whether or not each event is a partof a prepositional phrase.All of these features are extracted from the textvia regular expressions and application of theaforementioned third-party tools (such as WordNetand the Stanford Parser).
With the features extract-ed, the first experiment on TimeBank uses onlythose features identified by Mani et alExperi-ments two and three incrementally grow the fea-ture set with those identified by Lapata &Lascarides and Chambers, respectively.
The fea-ture sets can be seen in Table 1, above.
Results ofthis reproduction of the previous work are used asa point of comparison to the results of classifica-tion on our own Bio Corpus, using the same in-cremental growth classification scheme as before.Furthermore, we provide independent featureanalysis of a selection of the new features added byChambers over the Mani+Lapata set, leveragingthe results to draw some conclusions as to the lin-guistic differences existing between the two corpo-ra.5 ResultsWe first perform classification on TimeBankwith the feature set attributed to Mani, the resultsof which can be seen in Table 2.
Our system re-turns an accuracy of 51.97%, outperformingChambers?
reported result by one full point.
Thisover-performance is extended to the Lapata featureset in a 1.82 point increase over our results forMani?s features, versus the 1.32 increase seen inChambers?
reported results, which at least main-tains a similar magnitude of improvement.With the full set of features, including Cham-bers?
additions, our system exhibits a reversal inthe previous trend of over-performance.
As seen inTable 2, when Chambers?
reported results of60.45%, our own system returns results of only58.22%.
Not only does this leave a void of overtwo percent between the expected and actual accu-racies, but it represents a much smaller increase inperformance between Lapata?s and Chambers?
fea-ture sets on Bio.
In an effort to identify an under-performing feature, although without point ofcomparison from previous work, we explore anindependent analysis of the new features, andfound all features to be performing with at leastsome measure of improvement, as can be seen inTable 3.Mani?s feature set, when applied to the BioCorpus, returns similar results as on TimeBank,with slightly higher accuracy at 53.14%.
This531translates to a smaller improvement over the base-line than we see in the newswire domain, but main-tains approximately the same level of accuracy.Also following the same trend that is exhibited onTimeBank, the new features attributed to Lapatayield results with a small degree of improvementover the expected values at 55.4% versus Time-Bank?s 53.79%.The application of the full feature set returnsthe expected reversal of trend, but underperformsby an even greater degree at 56.65%, leading us tosuspect linguistic differences between the two cor-pora.
In an effort to confirm this, we perform thesame independent feature analysis as we performedon TimeBank.
Notable results of re-classification(seen in Table 3) came from the part-of-speechfeatures, as well as from the prepositional phraseheads.
Part-of-speech was found to degrade per-formance and drop accuracy from 55.40% to54.77%.
Omission of the part-of-speech from a fullfeature set classification does not, however, im-prove performance over the initial classification.The prepositional phrase feature, on the otherhand, returned the opposite result from part-of-speech ?
an improvement over the full feature setaccuracy at 57.34%, strongly suggesting the im-portance of prepositional phrases in classificationin the Bio Corpus.6 DiscussionOn TimeBank, results of temporal relationshipclassification return results similar to what wasexpected.
In the simpler feature sets of Mani andLapata, our own experiments over-perform by asmall margin in each case, maintaining a similarmagnitude of improvement at each step.
This smallbut interesting variation is likely the result of the61 additional event pairs in our version of theTimeBank corpus.
Given our lack of justificationfor the difference, this claim is merely speculative.On the final feature set, with the inclusion of allfeatures set out by Chambers, we still see a smallimprovement over the prior feature sets, but asmall magnitude of change, coming in at a high of58.22% compared to Chambers?
60.45%.
Whilestill reasonable, a sudden underperformance com-pared to the previous slight over-performances isunusual.
Justification for this discrepancy could beattributed to the differences in the data set, butthere is also a possibility that ambiguity in the de-scription of the features led to improper extractiontechniques.
Our analysis of the individual featurefails to return what we can identify as an under-performing feature, however.In the case of the Bio Corpus, we initially see asimilar trend in performance, with the feature setsattributed to Mani and Lapata performing as ex-pected, while the full Chambers set returns a lessthan impressive result.
Additional analysis of theindividual improvements from Chambers?
newfeatures, however, identifies two outliers to per-formance on Bio.
The underperformance of part-of-speech, and the surprising improvement basedsolely on the prepositional phrase feature, wouldsuggest different linguistic trends between the twocorpora.In future explorations of this topic, we wouldlike to expand the size of the biographical corpusand reaffirm its correctness through the use ofcross-validation between multiple annotators.
Thiswould help to ensure that no unintentional biaseshave skewed our results.
In addition, we would liketo further investigate feature selection to find abest-case subset for performance on the Bio cor-pus.
While we initially began such an analysis, thesheer number of potential combinations rendered itoutside of the scope of this work.ReferencesChang, C.,  Lin, C. (2001).
