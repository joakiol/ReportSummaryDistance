In this work we explore syntactic andsemantic characteristics of verbal correlates of speech-accompanying gestures.
The results ofthe corpora studies show, that we can reveal the statistical probability for certain types ofgestures to appear in given context.
For example, semantic correlates of deictic gestures aremostly noun phrases, and only in few cases these gestures correspond to adverbs, althoughthey may coincide with any part of a clause.
Single beats differ from other gesture types intheir tendency to accompany speech disfluencies, discourse markers, and unimportant partsof a clause.
Looking from the perspective if the meaning of words, accompanied by gestures,we can see, that new or re-activated referents might be presented with deictic gestures,uncertainty or direct speech are a domain of beat gestures.1 IntroductionGesticulation or speech-accompanying gestures perform the same functions, serve the same goals andrelate to the same information as do the words, as showed in (McNeill, 1992).
At the same time theinterplay of speech and gesticulation, especially distribution of pragmatic, semantic and referentialmeanings still stays unclear.
Maha Salem and her colleagues point out that synchronization ofdifferent modalities for conversational agents or robotic platforms ?is either achieved onlyapproximately or by solely adapting one modality to the other, e.g.
by adjusting gesture speed to thetiming of running speech?
(Salem et al.
2011).
Our work is aimed to describe statistical probability fordifferent types of gestures to appear in certain verbal contexts.
These contexts were describeddepending on their morphological and syntactical characteristics, as shown in part  3.1.
To achieve thisgoal we created two 20-minutes corpora consisting of TV talk-show fragments and retellings of ?Thepear stories?
(Chafe, 1980).2 Data analysis2.1 Corpus descriptionWe formed two different corpora to compare gesture properties in different types of discourse, namelydialogue and narration.
The first one included seven fragments of TV interviews and panel discussionof some common social issues and was supposed to include various types and styles of conversation.The aim of this corpus was to register as many examples of gestures with diverse functions in differentcontexts, as possible.
The second corpus consisted of eight retelling of ?The pear stories?
made byuniversity students with very little or no interventions by a listener, thus it was more homogeneousfrom the viewpoint of genre, topic and discourse structure, so it allowed comparing gesture features,concerning global discourse structure.
The results show, that most gesture functions are common fordifferent genres.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

Gestures were divided into five groups, usingmodified D. McNeill?s classification (1992).
Besides deictics, we distinguish descriptive, meta-discursive, beat and rhythmic gestures.
Considering the fact that distinctions between iconic andmetaphoric gestures are not always obvious (see e.g.
Gullberg, 1995), we reviewed these classes asdescriptive and meta-discursive, relying on the form of the gesture and its relation to speech.
Meta-discursive gestures treat simultaneous words as if from the outside, regarding speech as an object thatcan be transferred to an addressee, or manipulated in a different way (e.g.
a whole that can be dividedinto parts, or a process that can be accelerated or slowed down).
Descriptive gestures concern to thestoryline and reflect the content of the illustrated words.
Also we distinguish single beats and rhythmicgestures (named in Ekman, Friesen, 1969).
So, the main ground for this classification was the form ofthe gesture, also taking into account its meaning and relation to the corresponding words.
The futureanalysis proved the validity of this division.2.2.2 Characteristics of speech segments accompanied by gesturesWe examined the following types of gesture correlates:1. full clauses, which can describe the line of the story or else can bea.
meta-discursive (We are talking about?);b.
citations (He asked: ?How do you do it??);c.
repetition of the previous clause;d. reformulation or elaboration of the previous clause;e. false-start.2.
noun phrases, divided into groups relying on their accessibility and syntactical role;3. adverbs, considering their semantics;4. verbs and verbal phrases, taking into account their syntactical form and meaning5.
discourse markers, also divided into groups, following Schiffrin (1987).We labeled all the items in the corpora according to this list and compared the probability to beaccompanied of every type of gesture (or to appear without any gesture).
For referential gestures wecounted the speech segments with the same meaning, for beats and rhythmics only the temporalcorrespondence was possible.3 ResultsThe first corpus contains 545 gestures, the second one ?
338 gestures.
It seems worth to mention, thatproportions of gesture types were similar to those in D. McNeill?s study (1992), taking into accountthe difference in classification (Table 1).Table 1.

There was even an example, where the gesture was used without anexplicit verbal correlate (1) (the underlined words are accompanied by the gesture).
(1) Go!
(right palm facing the center, fingers extended toward the listener)When used with adverbs, deictics can reveal standard metaphors, such as past is behind us(Lakoff, Johnson, 1980), or appeal to common knowledge in the context of discourse, see (1).
(2) Like now and here.
(right palm up, fingers towards the listener slightly curved)Deictic gestures often mark the clauses of meta-discursive level, when the speaker points at himselfor at a listener, and also these gestures accompany citations, placing a referent in the space near thespeaker or illustrating adverbs.3.2 Descriptive gestures correlatesThese gestures tend to illustrate verbs and less often can be seen with noun phrases, comparing toother gesture types.
Only descriptive gestures, that have complex form and can carry muchinformation additional to words, were met with interjections.When used with clauses, these gestures tend to appear with reformulations, what can be explainedas a speaker?s intention to elaborate and to force her/his idea, so that visual illustration is needed,whether in order to resolve verbalization problems, the speaker?s rhetoric aim or listener?s demand(when the last does not completely understand the message).843.3 Meta-discursive gestures correlatesThe most often example of this gesture type is palm up opened hand (M?ller, 2004).
The semantics ofthe gesture reveals conduit metaphor (Lakoff, Johnson, 1980), when a speaker passes his words orideas to a listener.Meta-discursive gestures more often refer not to a single word, but to a phrase or a part of adiscourse.
Their form is less connected to the meaning of accompanied words, than it is with twoprevious types.
They are used to emphasize related words and often coincide with prosodicaccentuation.Meta-discursive gestures tend to appear with more static parts o?
a clause, like noun phrases anddiscourse markers, and less often are met with verbal phrases and adverbs.
It can be explained inconnection with the meaning of the conduit metaphor, which interprets the words said by a speakerlike a material object passed to a listener.
Nouns are less easier to be seen as objects than verbs.
So,NPs with meta-discursive gestures serve as topics or themes in the segment of a discourse.
When theyemphasize a whole clause, these gestures underline important links in the logic chain composed by thespeaker; usually these statements contain causes, consequences, or concessions, crucial forunderstanding of the described facts.Obviously, these gestures are often used with meta-discursive clauses, describing, for example, thestructure of a narration or intentions of a speaker.
Also they tend to accompany literal repetitions of aprevious clause.
This shows that meta-discursive gestures are also a rhetoric instrument, used with lessgraphic predicates, than descriptive gestures, and with less thought-out statements, than rhythmics.3.4 Beat and rhythmic gestures correlatesShort simple movements, usually up and down, can have only single words as their correlates, notphrases or clauses.
They are twice more often met with discourse markers, speech disfluencies, andconjunctions, than other gestures.
Also they tend to mark citations and repetitions.
We suggest thehypothesis that beats are oriented at a speaker and their use is motivated by cognitive tasks resolved bya speaker.
Another hypothesis of high beats frequency during the least interesting parts of a discoursecan be that they serve as pause-fillers, showing the listener, that the speech is not finished yet.Rhythmic gestures label each syllable of a word or each word in a phrase and often cover the wholeclause.
They are never met with discourse markers, pauses, or false starts, so we can suppose, thatthese gestures tend to mark well-planned parts of a discourse and serve as conscious rhetoricinstrument.
They tend to accompany citations, which are important in the discourse or emphasized bya speaker.4 ConclusionDeictic gestures may appear in any part of a clause, even without explicit verbal correlate, butsemantically they correspond to an adverb of time or place or to a noun phrase.
Another tendency forthese gestures is to illustrate meta-discursive sentences, describing the actual situation ofcommunication.Descriptive gestures can be met with verbs and verbal phrases more often, than other types, andthey are usually used with the reformulations and other important part of the discourse, contributing tothe story-line.
They avoid noun phrases and especially discourse markers.Meta-discursive gestures apparently are used with meta-discursive clauses.
Yet they tend toillustrate unfinished clauses, noun phrases or discourse markers.
They are not usual with verb phrases,citations and reformulations.Beats are remarkable for their tendency to appear with citations and repetitions, and especiallyspeech disfluencies and discourse markers.85Rhythmic gestures usually accentuate long segments of discourse, at least a clause, and they canbe used to underline citations, which the speaker considers to be important in his speech.AcknowledgementsThe research is supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research, grant 14-06-00211?Discourse production: method of observation, experiment and modeling?.ReferenceChafe, Wallace.
