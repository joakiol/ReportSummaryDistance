SELECTION FOR AN ATN STNTACT~C PARSERGiacomo Ferrari and Oliviero StockIstituto dl tingulstica Computazionale - C~TR, PlsaPerformance evaluation in the field of natural language processing isgenerally recognised as being extremely complex.
There are, so far, nopre-established criteria to deal x~th this problem.I.
It is impossible to measure the merits of a grammar, seen as thecomponent of an analyser, in absolute terms.
An "ad hoc" grammar, constructedfor a limited set of sentences is, without  doubt ,  more efficient in dealing withthose particular sentences than a zrammer constructed for a larger set.Therefore, the  first rudimentary criterion, when evaluating the relation~hlpbetween a grammar and a set of sentences, should be to establish whether thisgrammar is capab le  of analysing these sentences.
This is the determination oflinguistic coverage, and necessitates the definition of the linguisticphenomena, independently of the linguistic theory which has been adopted torecognise these phenomena.2.
In addition to its ability to recognise and coherently describelinguistic phenomena, a grammar should be Judged by its capacity to resolveambiguity, to bypass irrelevant errors in the text being analysed, and so on.This aspect of a grammar could be regarded as its "robustness" \[P.Nayes, R.Reddy1979\].3.
Examining o ther  aspects  of the  prob lem,  in  the  ana lys i s  chat  we propose  wewill assume a grammar which is capable of dealing with the texts which we willsubmit to it.Let an ATN grammar tl, vlth n nodes, be of this type.
N will be maintainedconstant for the following discussion.BY text we intend a series of sentences, or of utterances by one of thespeakers in a dialogue.
When analysing such a text, once a constant N has beenassumed, it is likely that, in addition to the content (the arglm~ent of thediscourse) indications will appear on the grammatical choices made by the authorof the text  (or the speaker) when expressing himself on that argument (how theargument  i s  expressed) .When these  ind icat ions  have been adequate ly  quant i f ied ,  they  can be used tocor rec t ly  se lec t  the  percept ive  s t ra teg ies  (as  de f ined  in  \ [Kaplan 72\] )  to beadopted in  order to achieve greater efficiency in the analysis of the followingpar t  of the  text.4.
For our experiments we have used ATNSYS \[Stock 76\], and an Italiangrammar with n - 50 (127 arcs) \[Cappelli st at.77\].
In this system, search isdepth- f i r s t  and the parser Interacts with  a heuristic mechanism whichorders  the arcs  accord ing  to a probab i l i ty  eva luat ion .
Th is  p robab i l i tyevaluation is dependent on the path which led to the current node and is also afunct ion  of the  s ta t i s t i ca l  data  accumulated  dur ing  prev ious  ana lyses  of a"coherent"  text .The mechanism can be divided into two stages.
The first stage consists of theacquisition of statistical data; i.e, the frequency, for each arc exiting from anode,  of  the  passages  across  that  a rc ,  in re la t ion  to  the  arc  of a r r iva l :  fo reach ar r iv ing  arc  there  are  as many counters  as there  are  ex i t ing  arcs .f {e)-*x. f (b}:y~f{ , ) :w .

I arc 1 has been crossed x t imes coming from a and y t imescoming from b.
In the  second s tage ,  dur ing  pars ing ,  in s ta te  S, i f  coming froma and w > x, arc 2 is cried first.1134.1 Thus, a first evaluation of the linguistic choices made is provided by theset of probabil ity values assocla~ed to each arc.
These figures can to someextent describe the "style" of any "coherent" text analysed.
(For this oneshould also take into account the different l in~uistlc signif icance of each arc.In fact a CAT or PUSH arc directly corresponds to a certain linguisticcomponent ,  while a JUMP or VIRT arc occurs in relation to the  techn ique  by whichthe network has been built, the linguistic theory adopted, and other variables.
)4.2 The second par t  of the mechanism, ~he dynamic reordering of the  arcs,coincides with a reordering of the co~prehension strategies.
In this way, amatr ix  can be assoc ia ted  to each  node ,  g iv ing  the  order  o f  the  s t ra teg ies  fo reach  arc  in arrival.For each text T, there is a set of strategies ~ ordered as describod above.While the analysis of the probabil ity values for distinct texts T and T" cangive global indications of their lln~ulstlc characteristics, if we focus on ~hecomprehension of the sentence, it is more meaningful to give nvaluatlons inrelation to the sets of strategies, ~T and ~ , which are selected.Fig.
2 shows , for some nodes, a comparison between the orders of the  arcs forthe first Ii sentences from two texts, a science fiction nnvel (SFN, upperboxes) and a handbook  of food chemistry (FC, lower boxes).
The  arc  numbers arereferred ~o the order in the original network.
The figures which appear afterthe - in the heading indicate the number of parses for each sentence.
An ec~cybox indicates the  same order as  that shown in the previous box.S b/,S2 1~ 1~312~,~RT 312312;P/Qn 312312~/~36 ~ 1/R~'L1 51324 5134252134 52134S/~3~"l 51234512.14;V/R~'I 41 235 4512341235 43125G~/Y 41 234213 2413123Sl 213 213123GV/~I~ I 123123G~N42 1 1231123?

The  results of our experiments so far confirm this.
This ir~rovedefficiency can be measured in three ways:a) locally, in terms of the computational load, due to non-determinism, ~ ich  issaved in each node.
In fact, by some experiments, it is possible toquantify the computational load of each type of arc.
The computational loadof a node is then a linear combination of these values and one can comgare itwith the actual load determined by the sequence of arcs attempted in thatpo in t  after the reorder ing .b) in terms of an overall reduction in comput ing  t ime;C) in  te rms  o f  penet rance ,  i .e .
the  ra t io  between the  number  o f  cho ices  wh ichactually lead to a solution and the total number of choices wade.5.2 If T is a text containing r sentences, the average penetrance will be:o .=..',where  ~ s tands  fo r  each  o f  the  sentences  in  T .I f  T i s  ana lysed  us ing  the  set  o f  s t ra teg ies  chosen  fo r  a d i f fe rent  text ,  T ?
,then  the  penet rance  i s ,  on average ,  no greeter  than  with~ T ?114In our experiments, for instance, the avera~_e oenetrance for the first text(SFN) parsed with its own strategies (~s##) is ~ed,SFN)  = 0.52, while parsedwith the strategies of the second text (Sty) is ~(5~,SFN) = 0.39.We have attempted to evaluate experlmentallv the relationship between thedifference of the average penetrances, which we call dlscrepanc7and the distance between two sets of strategies.
However we think we need moreexperimentation before formalizing this relationship.Returning to our science fiction novel, the discrenanc- using its set ofstrategies and the one inferred by the food chemistry text is6.
In addition to the definition of a heuristic mechanism which is capable ofi n~rov inE  the efficiency of natural l anguage process ing ,  and which can beevaluated as described above, our research aims at providing a means tochsracterise a text by evaluating the ~ramr~atical choices made by the authorwhile expressing his argument.We are also attemptin~ to tako into account the expectations of the listener.In our opinion, the listener's expectations are not limited to the argument ofthe discourse but are also related to the way in which the argument isexpressed; th i s  i s  the  equivalent of the cho ice  of a sdb-grammar \ [K i t t redge  7~\]We intend to verify the existence of such expectations not only in literatureor x~hen listening to long speeches, but also in dialogue.ReferencesI.
