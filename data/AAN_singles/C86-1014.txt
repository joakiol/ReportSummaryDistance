PROCESSING WORD ORDER VARIAT ION WITHIN A MODIF IED ID /LP  FRAMEWORKPrad ip  DeyUnivers i ty  of  A labama at  B i rminghamB i rmingham~ AL 35294~ U.S.A.ABSTRACTFrom a well represented  sample  of  wor ld  languagesSteele (1978) shows that  about  70% of  languages  exhib i ts igni f icant  word  order  var ia t ion .
On ly  recent ly  has  th isw lde-spread  phenomenon been drawing  appropr ia te  a t tent ion .Perhaps  ID /LP  ( Immediate  Dominance  and  L inearP recedence)  f ramework  is the  most  debated  theor ies  in thisarea.
We po in t  out  some diff iculties in process ing  s tandardID /LP  grammar  and  present  a modi f ied vers ion of  thegrammar .
In the  modi f ied vers ion,  the r ight  hand side ofphrase  s t ructure  rules is t reated  as a set or par t ia l l y  o rderedset.
An  ins tance  of  the f ramework  is implemented.1.
In t roduct ionF rom a well represented  sample  of  wor ld  languagesSteele (1978) ~,~hows that  about  76~ of the  languages  exhib i ts igni f icant  word  order  var ia t ion  | .
Unt i l  recent ly  thlsw idespread  phenomenon was  not  g iven proper  a t tent ion  innatura l  language process ing.
The  pr imary  goal  o f  tb is  s tudyis to  develop eomputat lona l ly  eff icient and  l inguist ical lyadequate  s t ra teg les  for  pars ing  word  order  var ia t ion .
Thes t ra teg ies  are  imp lemented  in a network  based  parser .
A tf irst we character i ze  the  bas ic  p rob lem at  an  abst ract  levelw i thout  go ing into detai ls  of  the prob lem in any  specificlanguage (in Sect ion-2).
Then~ in Sect lon-3,  the detai ls  of  theprob lems in a specific language~ namely~ Iilndi~ are presented .The  Immediate  dominance  and  l inear  precedence  ( ID /LP)f ramework~ deve loped by  Gazdar  and  Pul lum~ is one of  themost  debated  theor ies  in the  s tudy  of  word  order  var ia t ion(Pu l lum 1982~ Uszkore l t  1082, Shieber  1983, Bar ton  1985).The bas ic  idea beh ind  ID /LP  f ramework  is to separateimmediate  dominance  f rom l inear precedence  in rewr i te  rules.Pu l lum (1982) expresses th is  via a metagrammar .
Themodi f ied vers ion  presented  in th is  paper  expresses th is  d i rect lyin the  ob jec t  g rammar  e l iminat ing  the need for  ametagrammar .
I t  t reats  the  r ight  hand side of  a PS  (PhraseSt ructure)  ru le as a set or  par t ia l l y  o rdered  set.
Pars ing  wi thth is  type  of  rule can  proceed by  check ing set  membersh ip .2.
The  Word  Order  P rob lem in Genera lThe  word  order  prob lem is the  prob lem of process ing  thewhole range  of  word  order  var ia t ion  occur r ing  in natura llanguages .
Some Aust ra l ian  languages  uch  as War lp i r i  showext reme word  order  var ia t ion  (Hale 1983).
Hindi ,  Japaneseand  German also al low cons iderab le  word  order  var ia t ion .
Inth is  sect ion we develop descr ipt ive fo rmal i sms and  pars ingmechan isms that  are  adequate  for  the  whole range  of  wordorder  var ia t ion .Cons ider  a grammar  thdt  al lows a node  labeled S to  havedaughters  labeled $, O, and  ?
in any  l inear order~ andnoth ing  else.
Such  a grammar  can  be presented  w i th  a set ofru les such  as that  g iven in (2.1).
(2.1) S --> $ OV,  S --> $VO,  S --> 0 SV,S- -> OV$,  S - -> V$O,  S - -> VO$The  prob lem wi th  a grammar  such  as that  given in(2.1) is that  i~ needs  too  many rules to  capture  word  ordervar ia t ion  (in th is  case free word  order ) .
For  5 'words '  such  agrammar  will need 5!
= 120 rules.
Wi th  the  increase in thenumber  of words ,  such  a gra lnmar  will g row factor ia l ly .
Thatis, for  a number  of  words  it will need n/ rules.There  is a convYnient way  of  'co l laps ing'  rules in GPSG(Genera l ized Phrase  St ructure  Grammar)  of  Gazder  (1981).
Ituses metaru les  that  operate  on bas ic  rules to  generate  der ivedrules wh ich  then  funct ion  as bas ic  rules in der ivat ions .
Thus ,(2.1) can  be abbrev ia ted  as (2.2).
(2.2) Basic rule: \[_~ $ O V \ ]Metaru le :  \[5....X...Y...\] = :> \[S....y...X...\]where  X and  Y range  over  $, O, V.Wi th in  GPSG Pu l lmn (1982) suggests  another  so lut ionwh ich  also involves a metagrammar ,  t ie suggests  that  agrammar  such  as (2.1) can  be expressed v ia a metagrammarthat  t reats  immediate  dominance  and  l inear precedenceseparate ly .
Pu l lum's  theory  is known as ID /LP  analys is  2Accord ing  to  th is  theory  grammar  (2.1) "would be specif ied bymeans  of  the  metagrammar"  given in (2.3).
Similarlyj  themetagrammar  given in (2.4) "determines"  the  grammar  shownin (2.5).

In the  case of  (2.3) however  the set of  l inearprecedence s ta tements  is empty .
In the  case of  (2.4) $ ( Omeans  'it" any  rule in t roduces  $ and  O, $ l inear ly precedes O' .(2.3)a.

The  maind i sadvantage  of  the  s tandard  ID /LP  f ramework  is th~:t it isdiff icult to process  (Shieber 1983, Bar ton  1985).The a l te rnat ive  so lut ion proposed in th is  s tudy  t reats  ther igbt  hand side of  a rule as a set3  .

The  la t ter  rule is to  be unders tood  under  the nodeadmiss ib i l i ty  condi t ion .(2.a)a.

In pars ing ,  th is  so lut ion hasdefinite advantages .
Firstly~ the  factor ia l  g rowth  of  rules ise l iminated.
Secondly~ pars ing  can  proceed by  check ing setmembersh ip  or set difference.
That  is, ins tead of  'o rderedmatch '  the  parser  has  to  do 'unordered  match ' .
The preciseway  of  do ing  it will vary  f rom parser  to  parser .
We descr ibeone way  o f  imp lement ing  it in the ATN (AugmentedTrans i t ion  Network  (Woods  1970, F in ln  and  Hadden 1977))fo rmal i sm.Cons ider  the  ATN f ragment  presented  below in (2.7) forthe  grammar  given in (2.6).
Cond i t ions  on  are  are  given in .L ISP like s t ructures  wi th in  parenthes is .
Thus  (null $) means  'if65S-reglster is empty ' .
By the  arc WRD $ (null $), the  'word'  $will be accepted if no $ has previously been found.
(In natura llanguage, one can assume $ ~ Subject,  O ~ Object,  V =Verb, and use PUSH arc in place of WRD in the fol lowingd iagram.
)(2.7)WRD, (N~LL~ :23 WRDO(NULL_  O) / /WRD V (NULL V) J~ 4 POP (NOTNULL  $)(NOTNULL O) (NOTNULL V)~(2.7) parses any st r ings  generated by (2.1) by  scanningthe input  f rom left to r ight  and checking the set membersh ip .Thus, in recogni t ion and  pars ing,  (2.7) correct ly reflects (2.0).Suppose, the input  s t r ing  is VO$.
One way to see how asentence is parsed is to t race  through the analysis  of thesentence as are sequence.
This  s t r ing is accepted by  the arcsequence (3, 2, 1, 4).
The ATN given in (2.7) can be said tohave condit ioned mult ip le  loops.
For  convenience ofreference, we shal l  refer to ATN s t ructures  uch as (2.7) as'set-loops'.
Fur ther  restr ict ions on set- loops (such as (2.7)) canbe imposed and all const i tuent  order  var ia t ions  can be parseds imply by impos ing add i t iona l  condit ions on arcs.
Thus,  anATN parser  such as (2.8b) can parse the language generatedby the grammar  given in (2.5).
Formal ly ,  (2.5) is presentedwith a par t ia l ly  ordered set such as (2.8a) in the proposedf ramework.
The par t ia l  order ing is specif ied as a const ra inafter "/"~ as in a context-sensi t lve rule contexts  are specif iedafter "/''.(2.8)a.

R ight  handside of such expans ions can also show word order var iat ions  asshown in (2.9).
(2.9) $ --:> {a ,b ,c} ,  O --> (d,e},  V --~> {f ,g ,h}So far, we have descr ibed pars ing st rategies  forconst i tuent  order  var iat ions.
However, in natura l  language weoften find a d iscont inuous const i tuent .
That  is, an e lementcan be moved out  of i ts const i tuent  ( toplcal izat ion in Engl ishwould be a good example  if VP  is a const i tuent)  which can bedescribed by  categor ies w i th  holes (eg.
VP /NP) .
In cases suchas this, V IR arcs in combinat ion  with hold l ists arc used inATN (Bates 1978).
A l ternat ive ly ,  temporary  registers can beused to parse d iscont inuous const i tuents .
Temporary66registers are par t icu lar ly  su i tab le  to handle  large number  of'misplaced'  words that  cannot  be handled by  usual  HOLD listsin combinat ion  wi th  VIR arcs.
We would l lke to apply  thegeneral  s t rateg ies  descr ibed above to the case of Hindi whichshows considerable word order  var iat ion.3.
Word  Order  in HindiIn Hindl,  the order  of the major  const i tuents  such as $(Subject),  O (direct Object) ,  I ( Indirect object),  and  V (Verb(+aux))  is free.
For  example,  out  of the four const i tuentspresent  in (3.11.1), we can make twenty  four var iants  of thesame senteneep all  of which are perfect ly good in Hindi as isobvious f rom (3.11.1-24).(3.11/1.

($IOV /Mohan ag Ram to apple gave was"Mohan gave the apple to Ram."2.
mohan ne raam ko d laa thaa  sev.
($IVO)3. mohan ne d iaa than  raam ko sev.
($VIO)4. mohan ne d iaa than  sev raam ko.
($VOI)24. d iaa thaa  sev mohan ne raam ko.
(VO$I)To capture  the f reedom of order  of $, I, O~ and V insentences uch as (3.11) We can have a rule such as (3.12) inthe grammar  of Hindl.
The V alone can s tand  as a sentence inHindi since it is h ighly inf lected (see Kachru  1980).
Hence(3.13) is more appropr ia te  for Hindi where $~ I, and O aregiven wi th in  paratheses  to show thei r  opt ional  occurrence.
(3.12) (S ~'I'O'V }(3.13) ( ~ (,), (I), (o), v }We have been referr ing to rules such as (3.13 / as setrules.
An ATN f ragment ,  such as (3.14) would be appropr ia tefor (3.13 /.IC PUSH CNULL,I _j / /5 POP (NOTNULL  V) f(Assume appropr ia te  subnets  for $, I, O, V)Suppose we are pars ing (3.11.1) mohaa nc raam ko sev diaa than"Mohan gave the apple to Ram".

(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
The sentence given in (3.11.24) isaccepted by the arc sequence (3, 1, 4, 2, 51 .
(3.14) capturesconst i tuent  order  var ia t ion  in Hindl in a general  way.However, it is to be noted that  sentences uch as (3.11.1) haveb l - t rans l t ive  (or double t rans i t ive)  V. We have to imposemore condit ions on arc 5, POP,  to parse int rans i t ive  andt rans i t ive  sentences.
Informal ly,  the condit ions are: (1 / If  theV is in t rans i t ive  then  the I and O must  be empty.
(2) If  the Vis t rans i t ive  then  the I must  be empty.
We have implementeda large parser of Hindl wlth wide coverage of constructiontypes including relative clauses, interrogatives, passives,dative subjects, compound verbs and gapping which interactwith word order variation (see Dey 1982, 1984).Word order variat ion in Hindl is fairly restrictive.
Thus,in the sentences of (3.11) the main verb must precede theAUX.
(3.15) is unacceptable because it violates this restriction.
(3.15) * thaa dlaa sev mohan ne raam ko.was gave apple Mohan ag Ram toSimilarly, (3.16) violates the restrictlon that  the case elementsmust follow the noun (Verma 1970).
(3.18) * m~ mohan ram ko sev diaa thaa.ag Mohan Ram to apple gave wasAs obvious frmn (3.15-16), all rules of tIindi are not'set.rules'.
Thus, the subject"NP, $, cannot be expanded by(3.17a); rat\] .

h as (3.14) andpartial order rules such as (2.8a).
We also allow notions llkesubject and object.
That  means the grammar is an annotatedPS grammar.
The parsing strategy suggested above for thisgrammar has an important consequence.
It does not recognizeVP (thab dominates V, O, I) as a constituent.
It advocates a'flat' structure for sentences as shown in (3.1.8).

Concluding RemarksProcessing word order variation with new techniqueswithin the modified ID/LP framework seems to be revealing.But, it is not eontext"fl'ee nnlike other ID/LP based parsers.Detailed comparison of I I ) /LP based parsers is a subject offurther research.Footnotes:1.

The right hand side of a rule should be treated as arestricted set rather than as a pure set.
The restriction can bcstated as follows: a membvr of a set can occur only once in theset unless specified otherwise.
Thus, though formally thefollowing two sets are equal, under the restrictions imposedthey are notequah { $, O, V } =#= { $, O,V, $,V }References:Barton, G. \]5.
