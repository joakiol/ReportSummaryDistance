In t roduct ion .Cons ider  a device designed to read a text  in some r~tura llanguage~ in terpret  i t ,  and s tore  the content in some manner~ say,fop the purpose of  being able to answer  quest ions about i t .
Toaccompl i sh  th is  task~ the machine w i l l  have to fu l f i l \ [  at \ [east  hefo l low ing  baste requ i rement .
It has to be ab|e to bui ld a f i l e  thatcons is ts  o f  records  o f -a l l  the individuals~ that  is~ events~ objects~etc .
~ ment ioned in the text~ and~ for  e~eh individual~ record  whateveris said about i t .
OF couPse~ fop the t ime being at \[east~ i t  seems thatsuch a text  in terpreter  is  not a praet ica \ [  idea~ but th is  should notd iscourage us f rom studying.
in  abstPaet what  kind o f  capab i l i t i es  themachine would have to possess~ prov ided that  our  study prov ides  usw i th  some ins ight  into natura l  langL~ge in genera l .In th is  paper  I intend to  d iscuss one par t i cu la r  feature  a textin terpreter  must  have: that  i t  must  be able to recognize  when a novelindiv idual  is ment ioned in the input text  and to s to re  i t  atong w i th  i tscharacter i za t ion  fop fu ture  re ference .
Of course~ in some P_~ses theprob lem is t r i v ia l .
Suppose there  appears  in some sentence a propername that  has not been ment ioned prev ious ly .
Th is  means that  a new-2-pePson is being intPoduced in the text and appPopPiate action must  betaken to PecoPd the name of the pePson and what is said about him.OthePwise, the pPopeP name is used to PefeP to an individual alreadymentioned and the machine has to locate his file in the memory  withthe help of the name.
This pPob lem of identification wilt be mopedifficult where  a definite descPiption--a definite noun phPase such asthe man Bill saw 7estePda~,--is used, since thePe will, in genePal,not be any simple look-up procedure fop associating the descPiptionwith the Pight individual.
With definite noun phrases there is also thepPob lem that it is not possible to tell just f rom the noun phPase itselfwhetheP oP not it is supposed to refer" to an individual at all.
Fopexample,  it is cleaP that the phPase the best student is not usedPefePentiaUy in a sentence such as Bill is the best student.
-\[-here apethus two prob lems with ordinary definite noun phrases: (i) Is it adefinite descPiption at all?
and (ii) How to match  a definite descPiptionwith an individual already mentioned in the text?
The  fiPst question isclearly of the kind linguists can be expected to solve, but it will not bediscussed here.
The  only aspect of definite descPiptions that interestsus hepe is the fact that they caPPy an existential presupposition: tocall something "the ... " presupposes that there be some such thing.Whi le it is in genePal a stPaight-for~vaPd matter- to decide-3 -whether  o r  not a .p roper  name in a text  in t roduces  a new ind iv idual ,indef in i te  noun phrases pose a more  d i f f i cu l t  p robtem.
To  put thequest ion in a general  way:  Given an indef in i te  noun phrase,  underwhat  c i rcumstances  is there  supposed to be an indiv idual  descr ibedby th is  noun phrase?
Th is  need not be understood as some sor t  offonto log ica l  question subject  to phi losophical  speculat ion,  in th i spaper" \[ intend to approach it  f rom a purety  l ingu is t i c  point of v iew.It  is  in just  those cases where  the appearance o f  an indef in i te  NPimp l ies  the ex is tence of  some spec i f i c  ent i ty  that  our  hypothet ica ltext  in terpreter  shoutd record  the appearance of  a new ind iv idua l .What \[ have in mind can perhaps be made c lear  w ~:h the hetpof  the fo l low ing  examples ,  i t  is  a wat t -known fact  about language thatindef in i te  noun phrases  cannot be in terpreted  as re fer ' r ing  to expres -s ions when they appear, in the pred icate  nomina l  pos i t ion.

(c)  *The  cap i s  b lack .
(d) *B i l l ' s  cap i s  b lack .The  above examples  show that  jus t  in case of  (3a),  the textin terpreter  has to  recogn ize  that  the appearance  of  the indef in i te  NPa cap i rnpt ies  the ex is tence  of  a spec i f i c  car- that  can be ta lked  aboutaga in  by  re fe r r ing  to  i t  w i th  a p ronoun or" a de f in i te  noun phrase .

To  show that  th i s  i s  a l ingu is t i c  and not  an onto log ica l-5 -fact  one only has to point out that  examples  (5) and (6) behave justl i ke  (3) and (4).

Inth i s  paper we w i l l  t ry  to f ind out under what  c i rcumstances  d i scoursere ferents  are establ ished.
We mainta in  that the prob lem of  corefer - -ence w i th in  a d iscourse  is a l ingu is t i c  p rob lem and can be studiedindependent ly of  any genera l  theory  of ext ra - l ingu is t i c  re fe rence .The present  study was insp i red  by the notion o f  ' re fe rent ia lind ices '  in t rans format iona l  g rammar .
Fo l low ing  a suggest ion byNoam Chomsky (1965), i t  has genera l ly  been assumed that  the basecomponent of  a t rans format iona l  g rammar  assoc iates  w i th  each nounphrase a re ferent ia l  index, say, some in teger .
The purpose ofChomsky 's  proposal  was not so much to account fo r  the meaning ofsentences,  but to augment the notion of  noun phrase ident i ty .
I tseemed that  the notion o f  ' re fe rent ia l  ident i ty '  was needed in addi t ionto the two o ther  types o f  ident i ty ,  ' s t ruc tura l  ident i ty '  and 'morphemicident i ty ' ,  fo r  the s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ions  of  cer ta in  t rans format ions .Accord ing  to the s tandard theory ,  re fe rent ia l  ind ices  are mere ly-6 -fo rmal  ind icators  of core ference  w i th  no fu r ther  semant ic  s ign i f i cance .They  amP not meant  to  imp ly  the ex is tence  of  d i scourse  re ferents  in oursense .

Case  s tud iesl .
1 A note on spec i f i c i ty\[n the  fo l low ing  we amP going to  examine  case by  case cer ta inaspects  o f  sentence  s t ruc ture  that  p lay  a ro le  in c le termin ing  whetheran indef in i te  NP  es tab l i shes  a d iscourse  re ferent .
In the examplesthat  ape d iscussed~ there  i s  a poss ib le  ambigu i ty  that  has to  be men-t ioned  in advance ,  a l though i t  wil l  not  be d i scussed  unt i l  l a te r .
Ingenera l ,  indef in i te  noun phrases  have both a spec i f i c  and nor r - spec i f i cin terpretat ion .
Example  (7) can be in terpreted  to  mean e i ther  (8a) o r(Bb).
(7)(8)B i l l  d idn ' t  see a mispr in t .
(a)  'There  is  a mispr in t  wh ich  B i l l  d idn ' t  see'(b) 'Bi l l  saw no misprints'-7 -\[1 = (7) iS Understood in the sense of (8a), we say that theindef in i te  NP a mispr in t  is in te rpreted  spec i f i ca l l y .
(Sb) representsthe non-spec i f i c  in te rpreta t ion .
OF course ,  not a l l  indef in i te  nounphrases are  ambiguous in th is  way.
We could d isambiguate  (7) byadding the word  cer ta in  ( "a  cer ta in  mispr in t " )  o r  an appos i t ivere la t ive  c lause ( "a  mispr in t ,  which I had made on purpose") .
Thesechanges would a l low on ly  the spec i f i c  in te rpreta t ion  (8a).
The add i -t ion  of  the word  ~ ( "a  s ingle mispr in t " )  would a l low only  thesense (Sb).
There  a re  also cases where  the verbs  invo lved par t ia l l yd isambiguate  the sentence by  mak ing  one in terpreta t ionFar more  p laus ib le  to the reader  than the other .
For  example ,  theNP a piano in (9a) is  natura l l y  understood non-spec i f i ca l l y ,  that  is ,  asmeaning 'any piano' ,  whi te  the same noun phrase in (9b) suggests thelinterpretation 'a certain pianO'.
(9) (a) John t r ied  to  f ind a piano.
(b) John t r ied  to l i f t  a piano.
(but he d idn ' t  succeed inf ind ing one\]\ [but  he d idn ' t  succeed inl i f t ing  i t \ ]It  i s  someth ing about the verb  l i f t  that suggests that a piano descr ibessome spec i f i c  ob ject .
On the o ther  hand, (9a) is  eas i l y  understood toin fo rm us on ly  about the k ind of  ob ject  John was t ry ing  to f ind .
We notein passing that,  i f  i n te rpreted  in the above manner ,  (9b) es tab l i shes  a-8 -d i scourse  re ferent ,  i .
e .
,  'the piano John t r ied  to l i f t ' ,  but (9a)cer ta in ly  does not jus t i fy  a la ter  re fe rence  to 'the piano John t r iedto Find'.
Example  (7) es tab l i shes  a re ferent  in i t s  spec i f i c  sense'the mispr in t  wh ich  B i t t  d idn't  see ' ,  but fa i l s  to do so in the sense,of (Sb).I_et us fo rget ,  fo r  the t ime being, that  indef in i te  noun phrasescan a lso be understood spec i f i ca l l y  and cons ider  f i r s t  on ly  non-spec i f -ic in terpreta t ions .1.2 Complement  c lausesAs  pointed out above, an indef in i te  noun phrase does genera l lyes tab l i sh  a d i scourse  referent when it  appears  in a s imp le  a f f i rmat ivesentence.
But i f  the sentence is negated, a non-spec i f i c  NP fe l t s  toes tab l i sh  a re ferent .
Le t  us, tentat ive ly ,  accept th i s  f inding fo rs imp le  sentences and took  at cases where  an indef in i te  NP belongs toa complement  c lause.
There  are  many o ther  fac tors  that  play a rotehere  bes ides negat ion.\ ] .
21 Moda l  verbsThe fo l low ing  examples  a re  anomalous  in the intended sen&e,a l though there  is  no negat ion invo lved.
(10) (a) You must  wr i te  a le t te r  to your  parents .
*They  areexpect ing the le t te r .
(b) B i l l  can make a k i te .
*The k i te has a tong s t r ing .-9-Tr`aditionalty~ sentences with a modal  auxiliary have been consideredas simple sentences.
However~ it has been argued convincingly byRoss  (1967a) and others that modals  should be analyzed as main  ver"bso?
higher` sentences.
Therefore~ let us assume that~ even in the aboveexamples~ the indefinite NPs  originate in a complement  clause~ justas they do in (l l).
( l \ ] )  (a) John wants  to c~toh a f i sh .
*Do you see the f ish f romhere?
(b) Mary  expects  to have a baby.
*The baby's name isSue.There  is a great  number` of  verbs  that  behave l i ke  want  and e_.~pect inth is  respect~ e .g .
~ try~ ptan~ ~ hope~ etc .
What is  common toal l  o f  them is that  the complement  sentence by i t se l f  is  understood torepresent  a yet  untrue propos i t ion  at the t ime spec i f ied by the tenseand t ime adverb ia l s  in the main c lause.
The present pr`oblem~ is  infact~ another  point in favor` of  the v iew that  modals  o r ig inate  in ahigher" sentence~ because i t  enables us to acknowledge the s imi la r i tyof  the anomaly  in (10) and ( \ ]1 ) .
The conct'usion is that  non-spec i f i cindef in i tes  do not estab l ish  d iscourse  re ferents  when they appear` in acomplement  of  a modal  verb .l.
22 I mplicativesThere  is a class of verbs that~ if they are not negated~ implythe truth of the proposition represented by their" complement  sentence.Let us call them implicative verbs.
2 In English~ this group includes- lO -vePbs such as  manage,  r 'emembeP,  venture ,  see f i t ,  etc .

verbs ,  ca l led  fac t tve  verbs  (K iparsky  1968),that  p resuppose  the t ru th  o f  the propos i t ion  represented  by the corn -p lement .
For" example ,  know, realty_e, and regret  a re  fac t ive .

(15) John knew that  aar`y  had a car', but he had never" seen i t .In contr"ast to the imp l i ca t ive  ver"bs d i scussed  above,  negat ion  in themain  sentence has no e f fec t  at art .

(17) I doubt that Mary has a car.
*Bil l has seen it,On the other hand, ther~ ism~thing v~ong with the following example.
(18) Bi l l  dou~ts-that Mary has a car.
I have seen it.What makes these verbs difficult ?o handle is that there are two per-sons involved: the ~ l~r  and the subject of the non-factive verJo - -these ro les  may~ o f  couPse~ co inc ide .
The  speaker  i s  not  commit tedto any view whatsoeverabout  the truth of the L~rnbedded proposition,although he may imply what  his beliefs are as the discourse continues.For  exampie~ in (18), the speaker--unlike Bill---must hold that thecomplement  is true.
The  non-f-active verb is binding for the speakeron ly  in case he is ta lk ing  in  the f i r s t  person  as in ( \ ]7 ) .
BUt even  incase that  the speaker  w i thho lds  judgment  o r  d i sagrees  a l together~ anindef in i te  NP  in  the complement  o f  a non- fac t ive  verb  that  imp l iespos i t i ve  be l ie f  does es tab l i sh  a re ferent  o f  a pecu l ia r  sor t .
It can beIre fer red  to  aga in  in a complement  o f  a s imi la r  non- fac t ive  verb  thathas  the same sub jec t .-18-(19) Bill says he saw a lion on the street.
He claims the lionhad escaped f rom the Zoo.What  this amounts  to is that a text interpreting device will have to sortout what belongs to 'the world as seen by the speaker' and" 'the worldas seen by X'.
The same referents need not exist in all of theseworlds.A nor~fact ive  vePb that  imp l ies  pos i t ive  be l ie f  (clairr~, th ink ,be l ieve,  say,  e tc . )
a l lows  an indef in i te  NP in the complement  toestab l i sh  a re ferent  as fa r  as the wor ld  o f  the subject  person is corr-cer'ned but need not have the same e f fec t  in the speaker ' s  wor ld .
Anon-factive verb with negative implication (doLLb._~t) may still allow thata referent is added to the speaker's world, albeit not to the world ofthe subject person.
There is a spirited study of 'other worlds' byLakof~ (1968b).l .
25 Genera\[  remar 'ksWe can now genePalize the previous'  observat ion  about s inglesentences to cover  a lso complement  c lauses.
A non-spec i f i c  in -def in i te  NP in an a f f i rmat ive  sentence (s ingle sentence or  a comple -ment)  es tab l i shes  a d iscourse  re ferent  just  in case the propos i t ionrepresented  by the Sentence is assePted~ impl ied  or" presupposedby the speaker  to be t rue .
A non-spec i f i c  indef in i te  in a negat ive-14 -sentence es tab l i shes  a re ferent  on ly  i f  the propos i t ion  i s  imp l ied  tobe False.
This latter stipulation is needed because of negativeimplicatives discussed in ~ 1.22.
In general, discourse referentsexist in the rea lm 'world as seen by the speaker'.
However ,the non-factive verbs discussed in ?
I.
24 establish referentsin other rea lms and are ambiguous  as far as the speaker isconcerned.In order to decide whether  or not a non-specifEc in-definite NP  is to be associated with a referent, a text interpretingdevice must  be able to assign a truth value to the propositionrepresented by the sentence in which the NP  appears.
It mustbe sensitive to the semantic properVcies of verbs that takesentential complements ,  distin~ish between assertion,implication, and presupposition, and f\[nally, it must  distinguishwhat exists for the speaker f rom what exists only for somebodyelse.l .
26 An apparent  counterexampleThere  is  an in teres t ing  group  o f  verbs  that  seem toprov ide  a counter 'example  to  the genera l  ru le .
Cons{der  the fo l low-ing d i scourses .

(d) The  cas t ing  d i rector -  was  look ing  at aninnocent  b londe.

There  are  many other- verbs  in add i t ion  to  those  tn(20) that  have th i s  pecul iar" consequence,  for` exampte :  ask  for`,destr'e~ expect ,  hope for`, p ropose ,  ~quest ,  sugge~,  wat t  for`,yearn  for-.
I t  seems s ign i f i cant  that  most  i f  not  a l l  o f  thesever-bs, in add i t ion  to  or`dinar`y noun phrase  ob jec ts ,  atso takesentent ia I  complements ,  as  the fo t towing  examples  show.i 6 -(22) (a) Seymour  wanted  to  have a Imi fe .
(b) I p ropose  that  you  eat  a bage l .
(c)  John promised  to  g ive  Mary  a brace le t .
(d) Mary  expects  John  to  b W her  a braoe le t ,In fact, these are the same modal v~s  discussed above (?1.21)that imply that the proposition represented by the complement isnot yet true.
We can thus account for  tile l~culiarity of (20a-d)by assuming that, in spite of the simplicity-of the su~cestructure, the ordinary noun phrase objects of these verbsare derived f rom underlying r ~ ~ o n s  .which containsentent ia l  ob jec ts .
Th is  i s  c lear ly  one o f  those  cases  wheresemant ic  p rob lems can be s impl i f ied  by  assuming  a more  abst rac tdeep s t ructure .
But  i t  i s  not  ent i re ly  c lear  what  k ind  o f  embeddedsentence  shou ld  under ly  the sur face  ob jec t .
There  seems to  be l i t t leevidence for  deciding this question beyond the observation thatit  cer~cainly .~u ld  be some type of existential or  possessive con-struction.
This  is because of many noar  paraphrases of thefo l low ing  type.

4 Supposi t ionsAnother  way  to talk about what  is not is to suppose  that itis.
Cons ider  the following discourses.
(28)  (a)  Suppose  Mary  had a car .
She  takes  me to  workin  i t .  "
I d r ive  the  car  too .
(b) I f  tv~ary has  a oar~ she  will take me to  work  in it.I can drive the cam too.
(c )  I f  Mary  had a cam~ she  wou ld  take  me to  work  in  i t .I cou ld  dr ive  the  car  too .
(d)  I w ish  Mary  had a car .
She  wou ld  take  me to  workin  i t .
I cou ld  dr ive  the  car  too .
(e)  When Mary  has  a car~ she can  take  me to  work  inin it.
I can drive the car  too.All of the above  examples  elaborate a hypothetical situation thatis based  on the counter1:actual or  dubious premise  that Mary  hasa car .
The  difference between the first and  the second pair isthat in (28c--d) the condition is impl ied to be unrealizable or  hardto realize.
There  are clearly several  ways  in wh ich  a suppositionmay be introduced in a discourse.
Essentially~ however~ all of the- Z{  -above examples  reduce to  the fo rm IF  S O THEN S l .

(33) (a) Did you wr i te  a le t te r?

(b) Give me a hotdog, p lease.
I w i l l  eat i t .For  example ,  the in ter rogat ive  sentence in (88a) need not betaken as a t rue  quest ion at a l l ,  but as an express ion  ol =surpr i se  prompted by a preceding asser t ion .
(33b) couldbe understood as e l l ip t i c .
What is  imp l i c i t  is  "You  w i l lg ive me a hotdog. "
D iscourses  such as in (33) c lear ly  apenot counterexamples ,  s ince the i r  acceptab i l i ty  i s  not dueto the appearance of  an indef in i te  NP in a command orYes -No  quest ion,  but to o ther  cons iderat ions .- 23  -l .

TheFo l lowing examples  can be unders tood  at leas t  in two ways .
(34) (a) Ha hvey cour ts  a g i r l  at every  convent ion .
(b) Most  boys  in th i s  town are  in love  wi th  ago -go  dancer .
(84a) can mean that ,  at every  convent ion ,  there  is  someg i r l  that  Harvey  cour ts ,  o r  that  there  is  some g i r l  thatHarvey  cour ts  at every  convent ion .
Let  us ca l l  the aboveparaphrases  the non-spec i f i c  and the spec i f i c  in terpretat iono f  the N P a~r l ,  respect ive ly .

in the spectCtc sense,  Harvey  a lways  cour ts  thesame g i r l ,  in  the non-spec i f i c  sense,  i t  may  be ad i~erent  g i r l  each t ime.
S imi la r ly ,  a go -go  dancer  in (3413)a l so  has two in terpretat ions .

Spec i f i c i tyLet  us now re turn  to the prob lem of spec i f i c i ty  that was F irstin t roduced in ?
1.1.
As we a l ready  pointed out, many of the examplesabove that were  judged anomalous  in the intended sense can also begiven another  in terpreta t ion  that  makes them per fec t ly  acceptable .0Although 'non-spec i f i c '  indeFinites do not permi t  eoreFerence in (88),there is  nothing wrong  wi th  these examples  prov ided  that the indef i -nite NP is  understood ' spec i f i ca l l y ' .
(88) (a) B i l l  d idn ' t  f ind a mispr in t .
Can you Find i t?
(b) John wants to catch a f i sh .
You can see the f i shf rom here .How should we represent  th i s  d i s t inc t ion?
As  the te rms ' spec i f i c '  and'non-spec i f i c '  imp ly ,  t rans format iona l  g rammar ians  have t rad i t iona l lyassumed that there  is  a feature  \ [+spec i f i c \ ] ,  just  as there  i s  a featureF+deFinite\], and that indef in i te  NPs  a re  to  be marked  wi th  respect  tospec i f i c i ty .
Let  us ca l l  th i s  v iew,  that goes together  wi th  Chomsky 'so r ig ina l  proposa l  that  Core?erence be marked  w i th  integer-- type ind ices ,the c lass ica l  theory .
There  is  a lso another  approach to these, p rob-lems suggested by Emmon Bach (1968), James  O. McOawley  (1967),George l_ako?-?, and others .
The essent ia l  feature  ol = the i r  p roposa lsis that re fe rent ia l  ind ices  are  var iab les ,  bound by  quant i f ie rs  that actl ike quant i f ie rs  in symbo l i c  log ic .
What cor responds  to the indef in i te- Z6  -a r t i c le  i s ,  o f  course ,  someth ing very  s imi la r  to  the ex is tent ia lquant i f ie r  in p red icate  ca lcu lus .
(Bach ca l l s  i t  ' the some operator ' .
)Base s t ruc tures  resemble  fo rmulas  in symbo l i c  log ic .
Th is  approachto syntax  has now become known as 'generat ive  semant ics ' .It i s  easy  to see that  in the f ramework  o f  generat ive  semant icsethere  is no jus t i f i ca t ion  nor  need fo r  a feature  such as \ [+spec i f i c \ ] .The ambigu i t ies  in quest ion ape natura l ly  accounted fop by the fac tthat  the quant i f ie r  binding var iab le  that  under l ies  some indef in i tenoun phrase may be placed in d i f fe rent  pos i t ions  in the bases t ruc ture .
Spec i f i c i ty  thus becomes  a ITiEtter o f  the scope ofquant i f ie  r s .As  fa r  as the prob lems d iscussed in th i s  paper  ape re levantto choosing a theoPet ica l  f ramework~ they  seem to  argue in favor  ofadopt ing the Bach-McOawle~ proposa ls ,  I t  i s  ra ther  d i f f i cu l t  to  see,how one could achieve an adequate descr ip t ion  o f  the fac ts  in thec lass ica l  theory ,  FoP example~ cons ider  the fo l low ing  case.
Both(39a) and (39b) a re  ambiguous w i th  respect  to spec i f i c i ty .
(39) (a) B i l l  intends to v i s i t  a museum.
(b) B i l l  v i s i t s  a museum every  day.In the tspec i f i c t  sense~ both examples  estab l i sh  a discouPse re ferent .qI t  wou ld  make  per fec t  sense to  cont inue w i th  a descP~:~tion of  lthemuseum B i l l  intends to  v i s i t  t o r  fthe museum B i l l  v i s i t s  every  day' .- 2 7 -In the 'non-spec i f i c '  sense, there  is no such museum at a l l .
So fa rso good, we can say that  the NP a museum can be r+spec i f i c \ ] .
Butwhat  about example  (40)?
(40) B i l l  intends to v i s i t  a museum every  day.It is  c lear  that  (40) is  ambiguous in many  ways .
For  example ,the quant i f ied t ime adverb  every  day could be assigned e i ther  to thecomplement  o r  to the main  c lause,  le t  us now cons ider  on ly  the For-mer  case.
The remain ing  ambigu i t ies  should be a t t r ibutab le  to theindef in i te  NP a museum,  in Fact, we should have a two--way ambigu i tybetween the specific and nort-specific interpretation.
But example(40) is stilt ambiguous in more  than two ways.
It could be inter-preted to mean (41a)~ (41b), or  (41c).
(41) (a) 'There is a certain museum that Bi l l  intends tovis i t  every day.
'(b) 'Bi l l  intends that there be some museum that hevisits every day.
'(c) 'Bi l l  intends to do a museum visit  every day.
'It is easy to see why this happens.
What the feature F?specific\]accomplishes in case of (39a) is that it c lar i f ies the relation betweenthe indefinite NP a museum and the verb intend in the main sentence:Is B i l l ' s  intention about some part icular museum or  not?
In (39b),we employed the same device to characterize the relation between- Z8 .the  quant i f ied  t ime a d v e r b ~  and the indef in i te  noun phrase:Is i t  the same museum every  day or  not?
To  do the work  in (40) wewould  need two  features~ one to character i ze  the re la t ion  betweenintend anda  museum,  another  fo r  the re la t ion  between a museumand every  day.
Under  the in terpreta t ion  (4\ ]b) ,  fo r  exampte ,  _amuseum would  be non-spec i f i c  w i th  respect  to the  verb  intend butspec i f i c  w i th  respect  to the quant i f ied t ime expr-ession.
But  to saythat  there  a re  severa l  var ie t ies  of  spec i f i c i ty  is  a way  of saying thatthere  is  no feature  r+spec i f i c \ ]  at a l t .
The c tass icat  theory  c lear lyis  not su f f i c ient  to  account fo r  the mul t ip le  meanings  of  (40).5On the o ther  hand, in the Bach-McOawtey  f ramework  we areable to  account fo r  the ambigu i t ies  in a st ra ight- for~Nard way.
Thethree  senses of  (40) d iscussed above might  be represented  rough ly  asin (42).
6(42) (a) (~ x)r  museum(x) ,  in tend(B i t t ,  (every  day)v i s i t (B i t t ,  x ) ) \ ](b) in tend(B i t t ,  (~x)r museum(x) .
(every  day)v ts i t (B i l t ,  x ) \ ] )(c) in tend(B i l l ,  (every  dayX~x) \ [  museum(x) ,  v i s i t (B i l l ,  x ) \ ] )Another  advantage of generat ive  semant ics  is  that  there  is  an exp lana-t ion  ready  fo r  the fact  that  (40) es tab l i shes  a d iscourse  re fe rent  underon ly  one of  the th ree  in terpreta t ions  we have cons idered,  narnely  (42a).IThe ru le  i s  that  an indef in i te  NP es tab l i shes  a permanent  re fe rent  justin case the propos i t ion  to  wh ich  the b ind ing quant i f ie r  is  attached is- 29 -assumed (asser ted ,  imp l ied ,  o r  presupposed) to be t rue ,  prov idedthat the quant i f ie r  is not i t se l f  in the scope of some h igher  quant i f ie r .
7The F i rst  par t  of  the ru le  accounts For the d i f fe rence between (42a)and (42b-c) ,  the second par t  is needed to exp la in  why (39b) estab-l i shes  a permanent  re ferent  only under one of  the two possible in ter -p re ta t ions .
Not ice that,  in (42a), the quant i f ie r  under ly ing the NPa museum is attached to the main  propos i t ion .
Since the mainpropos i t ion  i s  asser ted to be t rue  and there  are  no h igher  quant i f ie rsinvolved,  (2~2a) estab l i shes  a re ferent  cor respond ing  to the NP amuseum.
Now, cons ider  the o ther  two in terpreta t ions  o f  (40).
Theverb  intend is one of the modal  verbs  discussed in (1 .21) .
We knowthat  the complement  of  a modal  verb  taken by i t se l f  is  not imp l ied  orpresupposed to be t rue .
In (42b) and (42c), the quant i f ie r  under ly ingthe NP a museum is  attached to the complement .
Therefore~ theabove ru le  cor rec t ly  p red ic ts  that  no re ferent  cor respond ing  to ammuseum is establ ished under these two in terpreta t ions .F rom the point of  v iew of a text  in terpret ing  device,  the c lass i -cal theory  has t i t t le  to recommend i t se l f .
The prob lems studied abovec lear ly  argue in Favor of the Bach-McOawtey  f ramework ,  in p roces -sing a sentence, a text interpreter apparently has  to associate anindefinite NP  with a variable and attach the binding quantifier to somesentence above the NP  using whatever  clues there are present to- 30 -ass ign  the scope wi th  as l i t t le  ambigu i ty  as poss ib le .
Clues thatreduce scope ambigu i ty  include the presence of an appos i t ive re la t iveclause or of special words  such as "certain"~ "single"~ and "some"in the noun phrase i t se l f  and the sur face  order  of  quant i f iers~ nega-t ion ,  and ar t i c les  in the res t  o f  the sentence.
Secondly~ the in ter -p re ter  has to keep t rack  of the t ru th  value o f  the propos i t ion  repre -sented by the sentence to which  the quant i f ie r  is  attached.
Thefo l low ing  example  demonst ra tes  some o f  the diFFiculties that  areinvo lved .
Let  us s ta r t  a d i scourse  w i th  (43).
(43) Mary may want  to  mammy a Swede.H igh ly  schemat ica l ty~ the under ly ing  s t ruc ture  o f  (48) is someth ingl i ke  (44).
(44)NP VPI I ~ mayMary  want  N PIMary  marry  xJ The quant i f ie r  that  binds the var iab le  under ly ing  the NP a Swedemay belong to any of  the three  sentences,  S l ,  S 2, and $3,  whichcauses (43) to  be ambiguous  at leas t  in the fo l low ing  three  ways ./- 31  -(45) (a) 'There  is  some Swede whom Mary  may want  tomarry .
'(b) ' I t  may  be the case that  there  i s  some Swede whomMary  wants  to  marry ,  '(c) 'It may  be the case that Mary  wants her futurehusband to be a Swede.
'Of the three sentences involved, only S l is asserted by the speakerto  be a t rue  propos i t ion .
The  two o ther  sentences ,  S 2 and S8,  a reboth commanded by a modal  verb  (may and want) ,  there fore ,  their"t ru th  is  not imp l ied  or  p resupposed .
The indef in i te  NP  a Swedees tab l i shes  a d i scourse  re ferent  jus t  in case i t s  b ind ing quant i f ie r  i sa t tached to  S 1" Th is  can be demonst ra ted  eas i ly  by po in t ing  out that ,i f  the speaker  cont inues  the d i scourse  w i th  (46),  the preced ing  sentence(48) can on ly  be unders tood  in the sense o f  (4.5a).
(46) She in t roduced h im to  her  mother  yes terday .However ,  the fo l low ing  cont inuat ion ,  .where  the pronoun its' s tands  for"$2 ,  permi ts  both (4,5a) and (45b).

SummaryIt i s  t ime to  rev iew the s i tuat ion .
We s tar ted  by  ask ing  theseeming ly  na |be  quest ion :  "When i s  there  supposed  to  be an ind iv idua lassoc ia ted  w i th  an indef in i te  noun phrase?"
Na|k/e as  i t  may  be, i tmust  be answered  in case  there  is  ever  go ing  to  be a dev ice  fo r  in ter - -p re t ing  wr i t ten  texts  o r  everyday  conversat ion  w i th  anyth ing  approach-ing human soph is t i ca t ion .
There  i s  a l so  another  reason  to  bein teres ted  in the  sub jec t .
F rom a l ingu is t i c  po in t  o f  v iew,  i t  i s  ap rob lem o f  core ference  const ra in ts  o f  a somewhat  d i f fe rent  k ind  thanthose  s tud ied  under  the  labe l  ' P ronomina l i za t ion ' .
The  present  type  o fconst ra in ts  a re  even  more  bas ic .
I t  wou ld  seem that  the quest ionwhether  two  noun phrases  can be core ferent ia l  at  a l l  must  p recede  thequest ion  whether  a pronoun-antecedent  re la t ion  may ho ld  between them.Second ly ,  i f  re la t ive  c lauses  are  der ived  t rans format iona l ly  f rom con-jo ined  sentences  by  'Retat iv i za t ion ' ,  as  many l ingu is ts  be l ieve ,  theconst ra in ts  d i scussed  here  are  a l so  a prerequ is i te  For that  t rans forma-t ion .
For  these  reasons~ the  prob lems s tud ied  in th i s  paper  a re  o fsome theoret i ca l  in teres t  qu i te  independent ly  f rom whether  the  resu l t slead  to  any  pract i ca l  app l i ca t ions .- 3 4 -We found that ,  in s imp le  sentences that  do not contain cer ta inquant i f ie r - l i ke  express ions ,  an indef in i te  NP estab l i shes  a d iscoursere ferent  just  in case the sentence is an a f f i rmat ive  asser t ion .
By'es tab l i shes  a d i scourse  re ferent '  we meant  that  there  may be acore ferent ia t  pronoun or  def in i te  noun phrase ta ter  in the d i scourse ,indef in i te  NPs  in Yes -No  quest ions and commands  do not estab l ishre fe  rents .In studying more  compl i ca ted  examples ,  i t  was found neces-saP) / to  rep lace  Chomsky 's  in teger - type  re ferent ia l  ind ices  by boundvar iab les .
In th i s  f rarnework~ the t rad i t iona l  p rob lem of  spec i f i c i tyis t reated  as scope ambigu i ty .
We studied severa l  types of  verbsthat  take complements  and the i r  semant ic  p roper t ies .
We concludedthat~ in general~ an indef in i te  NP es tab l i shes  a permanent  d iscoursere ferent  jus t  in case the quant \ [ f ie r  assoc iated w i th  i t  is  attached to asentence that  is  asser ted ,  impl ied~ or  presupposed to be t rue  andthere  ape no h igher  quant i f ie rs  invo lved .There  ape a couple of  spec ia l  p rob lems:  'o ther  wor lds '  andshor t  te rm re ferents .
A l though d iscourse  re ferents  o rd inar i l y  ex i s tfo r  the speaker~ there  is  a c lass  of  fworid--cr@ating t verbs~ such asbe l ieve r that  a lso es tab l i sh  PefePents o f  another  kind.
These ex is tfop somebody  else~ not necessar i l y  fo r  the speaker .
ThePefoPe~ weneed to  d is t ingu ish  between the speaker ts  wor ld  and o ther  rea lms- 35 -and  al low fo r  the poss ib i l i ty  that  they are  not populated by the sameind iv iduals .
Secondly,  there  are  shor t  te rm re ferents ,  whose l i fe -span may be extended by cont inuing the d iscourse  in the proper  mode.What th is  p roper  mode is depends on the c i rcumstances .
FoPexample ,  every  success ive sentence may have to contain ( i)  a modalas the main  verb ,  ( i i )  a quant i f ie r  of  a cer ta in  type,  or" ( i i i )  be in thecounter factua l  mood.
That  is,  i t  is  poss ib le to e laborate  for" a~vhiteon s i tuat ions  that  are  known not to obtain o r  that  may or  shouldobtain and d iscuss what  somet imes  or  a lways  is  the case.FOOTNOTES* Th is  work  was  supported by the Nat ional  Sc ience Foundat ionGrant  GU-1598 to  the Un ivers i ty  o f  Texas  at Aust in .1 These examples  a re  due to  C.

Wal l  fo r  suggest ing the te rm ' imp l i ca t ive 'to  me.3 What  remains  unexpla ined here  is  the fac t  (pointed out to me byJohn Olney)  that  must  in (27) has two  mean ings  depending on thespec i f i c i ty  o f  the NP  a r i ch  man in the preced ing sentence.
I f  thef i r s t  sentence i s  about a spec i f i c  man,  then must  in the secondsentence is  in terpreted  in a ra ther  weak  sense: ' I t  is  l i ke ly  that  he isa banker ' .
But  t f  the NP a r i ch  man is non-spec i f i c ,  the  secondsentence means:  ' I t  i s  necessary  that  he be a banker ' .4 George Lakof f  ( fo r thcoming)  has suggested that  quant i f iePs andnegat ion  be ana lyzed as verbs  (p red icates )  instead o f  g iv ing them aspecial status, as is usually done in symbolic logic.
It is yet unclearto me whether  there is any st,,bsta,.-tive issue involved or whether hei s  only propos ing  another  no~- ' _  .-,.5 There  are other good aPgurr~nics against the feature \[ *_ specific\] inJanet  Dean 1968.
Unfor tunate ly ,  they  did not persuade the authorherse l f .6 The  complement  of intend is what  W.  V. O. Quine calls 'opaquecontext'.
\] ignore here his view that one should not be permitted toquantify into such a context.
It seems to me that the objections heraises have to do with the double Pole names  play in such contextsand only call fop moPe sophisticated linguistic analysis.
Notice thatQu~ne approves  o f  ( i )  wh i le  re jec t ing  ( i i )  as mean ing less  '(Quine 1960, ?p.
166):( i )  (~x) (Tom be l ieves  x to  have denounced Cat i l ine )( i t )  (~x) (Tom be l ieves  that  x denounced Oat i l ine )From a linguistic point of view, however, there is nothing but asuperficial differenoe between (i) and (ii) due to 'Subject raising' thatl~s applied in (i) but not in (ii).7 By  'higher" quant i f ie r "  I mean quant i f te r ' s  such as al.._.t, each,  many,and few,  in fac t ,  everyth ing  except  the quant i f ier"  assoc ia ted  Mth  thes ingular"  some and the indef in i te  a r t i c le .
The  reason  for" mak ing  th i sd i s t inc t ion  i s  the fac t  that ,  i f  there  are  two indef in i te  s ingu lar  NPs  inthe same sentence ,  both es tab l i sh  a re ferent  no mat ter  what  their"order`  i s .
