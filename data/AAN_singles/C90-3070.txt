A SELF-LEARNING SYSTEMFOR THE CHINESE CHARACTERSGeorges FAFIOT\[EGETA, IMAG (UJF & CNRS)BP 53X, 38041 Grenoble Cedex, FranceAbstractWe me prototyping a system tor the self-learning ofChinese characters, presently on a Macintosh computer.The interactive inlormation base provides the learnerwith basic universal properties of the characters(morphology, intrinsic meaning), extended wilh a quitecomprehensive set of language-dependent aspects(phonetics, extended semantics, contextual or pragmaticattributes).
The user is intended to have a professional orcultural non-academic motivation.
The system allows toexperiment on Heisig's proposal involving theseparation of Chinese characters learning (or Japanesekanji) from that of the language.
A prototype underHyperC~rd may be demonstrated on a subset of about200 characters.KeywordsChinese characters, Kanji, interactive informationbase, computer aided learning, personalized autonomousacquisition of Chinese characters.1.
Project motivationThe aim of the project is twofold: the first part is tomodel an :interactive information base on characteristicproperties of Chinese characters (or Japanese kanji),which would lend itself to personalized self-instructionin a tree exploration or encyclopedic mode; and thesecond is to build the base on which we maysubsequently explore an Intelligent Tutoring Systemarchitecture, which would take into account the expertisealready gained by the learner over prior sessions.
Thework presented in the paper concerns the first aim.The system is intended to provide a public ofeducated users with an adaptive nvironment for theautonomous learning and review of the properties ofideogrmns, such as their etymology, structure, graphicform, phonetics, semantics, composition (semantic andphonetic) within other characters... \[CIYUAN 1984,NELSON A.N.
1974\].Our system is not for the study of the Chineselanguage or even of Chinese words (which are usuallycomposed of more than one character), but solely forthat of the characters as basic morphological units, eventhough instantiated with phonetic and semantic valuesin Chinese.We had initially intended to follow Heisig'sview \[HEISIG 1977\], which separates the acquisition ofthe universal qualities of characters (basicallymorphology and intrinsic meaning), from the learningof language-dependent aspects (such as thepronunciation, semantics, pragmatics in their use, etc).But for developing other applications, it seemedadvisable to also include in our base a comprehensiveknowledge of language.-specific attributes, as it is firston Chinese language.The normal target user is not a scholar.
He (or she)is an active adult, who is not assumed to have theavailable time nor the tbcusext motivation to undertakean intensive academic program (he is a scientist or atechnical or industrial executive).
Rather, he wishes tostudy the characters in a self-paced, extracurricularfashion, or to develop a multifaceted view of themaccording to his interests.
The user wants to grasp andto memorize characters' important properties, to initiatehis own "learning information base" on them, so, forexample, not to feel illiterate during working visits inChina or Japan.
Later he might gradually enlarge andinterrelate his personal knowledge items.The learner will be given access, via an encyclopedicmode which provides a highly interactive user interface,to either basic properties or to extra specific informationon the characters.
He will be able to do so startingeither from a key property he knows about a character,or from a partial (and even partially erroneous)description of it.He will be also encouraged to record his personaldiscoveries or conclusions as additional materials: hispersonal mnemonics, his own mental images or self-built references on semantic links between characters,between their graphic form and meaning, etc.
It hasbeen shown that such an active and creative approach isvery suitable to Western learners for autonomousacquisition and development of cognitive skills duringfile study of Japanese kanji \[HEISIG 1977\].2 .
Overa l l  v iew o f  the  sys temCentral objects in the information base of thepresent project are: the current standard information baseon characters (which merges basic and special materialon their properties, textual, ideographic, and sound data),the learner's current personal information base (with hisaddition~fl notes), and the learner's current profile (data healready accessed, drawn from a session journal or aglobal curriculum report).1 351The main functional handlers in the system are asfollows: a learner and a developer interface, a queryanalyzer and character selector, a session monitor, asession observer, and a session and profile editor.The identification and the selection of the workingcharacter (not a pattern recognition of a character drawnby hand) will interpret the learner's query, with respectto a subset of classical descriptive properties uch as:the meanings, pinyin codes or stroke numbers of thecharacter and/or of its semantic or phonetic radical if ithas one.
An expert assistant module will be added toenhance the interactive character selection, whilemanaging missing or erroneous items in the query.3.
The  in fo rmat ion  thesaurus  o fCh inese  charactersActivities proposed in the system allow the study ofa comprehensive s t of properties of a character.
In theinformation base there are actually two levels ofaccessibility: basic essential information, and additionalmore detailed (or erudite) material \[WIEGER 1972,RYJIK 1980\].
They are all listed here, in the context ofthe Chinese language.Morphology:the etymology of the character, its iconographicorigin and evolution,its generic ategory (among 6 classical ones),the calligraphy (the stroke order, the differentwriting styles, their evolution) \[ZHONGGUOSHUFA DA ZIDIAN 1983\],the structure (synthetic representation f themorphological tree of the character, semanticand/or phonetic radicals within it),the use in derivation or composition within othercharacters.Phonetics:- the pinyin encoding, the tone,- the standard pronunciation (from a digitized soundbase),- ultimately, different provincial or colloquialpronunciations.Semantics:- the usual meaning,mnemonics proposed to the learner,learner's personal mnemonics~common "false friends" (misleading similarities),other characters inhomomorphy, homonymy,usually confusing homophones,synonyms, antonyms.4.
Cur rent  p ro to typ ingWe first modelled the pertinent material oncharacters, and specified an interaction scheme for theuser, then the learner interface.We refer to an iterative cycle for the softwaredevelopment.
We have prototyped first a simplifiedversion of the system on a very small subset of thecharacter base, in order to validate the data structure, thedesign of the main functionals and the user interface.We have chosen object-oriented programming toolsas well-suited to the incremental realization scheme.Thus far, this first version is being developed on AppleMacintosh under the HyperTalk-HyperCardenvironments, regarded as fair facilities forimplementing hypertextual and voiced applications.
Asecond level of prototyping is expected on a Xerox AIworkstation using LOOPS and Common Lisp.5.
Fur ther  deve lopmentShort-term steps:We are currently initiating the first model validation.Then are planned both a moderate quantitative, and aqualitative, extension of the system.
We will firstenlarge the character set to about 300 units, whilemonitoring both systematic assembly cost, and systemefficiency measurements.Qualitatively, the complementary properties in thecharacter base will be completed, and the phonetics willbe voiced.
Next to be worked on, in the prototype, are asession journal manager, and the interactive characteridentification and selection function.In the future:A possible trend leads towards asystem of formativeuse, with a real scale character base and ergonomicenrichment.On another line for evolution, the system is a basistowards exploring knowledge based architectures, whichthen incorporate objects and functional handlers inheritedfrom the design of Intelligent Information RetrievalSystems \[BRUANDET 1989, CHIARAMELLA 1987\]or Intelligent Tutoring Systems \[WINKELS 1988,WENGER 1988\].352 2Conc Ius ionThe project focuses on characters only, yet a vastfield of investigation for foreigners (and one of practiceand review, for native users).
Moreover, extending thesystem capability to word formation, then to structuralor pragmatic views on the language itself, wouldundoubtedly require much dedicated work on thelanguage didactics.It would be of interest however, in order to confirmor to infirm Heisig's hypothesis, to experience differentpractice strategies on an adequate version of tim system,and to value whether one better teams characters whilesetmrating their study from that of the language, orwhile merging them.A rewarding aspect lies in the scopes of futuresystem developments: a realistic and versatile pedagogicuse on widely accessible micro-stations, as well as acontribution to stepwise modelling of built-inintelligence, for Computer Based Learnig Systems; andlast, in the attempt o develop tools for giving largeraccess to Chinese characters - a vehicle forcommunication between over one billion people - in theframe of intercultural development.AcknowledgementsMy deep thanks will go indeed to Frangois Tcheou.Without his wide expertise on tim Chinese language,and distinguished calligraphy, this work could certainlynot have been carried out.
