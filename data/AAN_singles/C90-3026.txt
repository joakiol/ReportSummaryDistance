Hierarchy  o_ff Sallenee an__dd Discourse  ~alys l s  and Product ionEva HaJl~ov~, Petr Kubon and ?1a~Islav KubonNA~ - llng~i8%lesCharles UnlversltyXalos%ransk~ m~.25CS-118 O0 PragueAbstractThe hierarchy of salience of the itemsof the knowledge assumed by the speaker tobe shared by him and by the hearer constitu-tes one aspect of a dynamic account ofdiscourse (Sect.
I).
It is claimed that arepresentat ion of this hierarchy is a goodsupport for discourse analysis (referenceassignement,  Sect.
2) and for discourse pro-duction (pronominal lzat lon, definite des-cription, Sect.
3).1.1 In studying communicat ion,  it mustbe distinguished between the speaker's ownimage, the hearer's image and the assumpt-ions the speaker has made about the hearer'simage of the world.
In the very process ofdiscourse, the image of the world undergochanges of different kinds: new objects,relations, etc.
are added to the repertoirson the basis of the content of what has justbeen said, the universe of discourse may berestr icted in that a certain of phenome:,a ofa part icular kind is marked as relevant forfurther discourse whereas the other ele-ments are disregarded, or the salience(activation, foregrounding) of the items ischanged in the sense of being easily access-ible in memory (see Sgall, Haj i~ov~ and Pa-nevov~, 1986, p. 54f).
I% has been shown(Haji~ov~ and Vrhov~, 1982; Haj iSov~, 1987)that the changes of salience are dependentto a great extent on the topic/focus art icu-lation of the utterance.
As a matter offact, most algorithms for anaphora resolu-tion work with the notion of salience(el., e.g., Hobbs, 1976; Sidner, 1979;Brennan, Friedman and Pollard, 1989); how-ever, while in most of these approaches thedegrees of salience are given only syntact-ically, the hierarchy of act ivation in ourmode\] is elso determined by the toplc/focus144art iculat ion of the sentence.Leaving aside the dist inction betweenthe contextual ly hound and non-boundelements of the utterance within Its topicand focus parts (for the relevance of con-textual boundness in this respect, see HaJ i -~ov~, Hoskovec and Sgall, in press), theserelat ionships can be summarized as follows:(1) the items referred to in the focusof the utterance be it by a noun phrase orby a stressed pronoun receive the highestdegree of salience;(ii) the items referred to by a nounphrase in the  topic part of the utteranceare activated one degree less than the itemsreferred to in the focus part;(ill) a pronominal reference to an itemin the topic part of the utterance keeps theactivation unchanged;(iv) the activation of the items notmentioned in the given utterance fades away;the fading is steeper if the given item wasthe most activated item after the precedingutterance and less steep if the given itempreserved high salience for some of theprevious utterances, being mentioned in itstopic.We do not attempt to cover "VP-anaphorasince in the model of the stock of knowledgeassumed by the speaker to be shared by himand the hearer (SSKK) we work - for the timebeing - only with mental images of ob-jects, rather than wlth those of events.1.2 Several thresholds can be es-tabl ished on the hierarchical  structure ofthe activated part of SSK; at \].east two ofthem are important in the context of thepresent paper.
One threshold characterizesthose items of the SSK that are activatedto such an extent that they can be referredto in the topic part of the fol lowingutterance; this is to say that the salienceof these items is large enough for thehearer to identify easily their referents?The second (higher) threshold delimits thatpart of SSK the items of which can be re-ferred to by pronouns; their salience isassumed by the hearer to be large enough forthe speaker to assign the reference in astraightforward way.1.3 The representation of the discoursein terms of the hierarchy of activation ofthe elements of SSK suggests itself to beused for a split up of the discourse intosegments; the segments correspond to thoseparts of the discourse for which there is acharacterist ic grouping of most activateditems.
These most activated items in eachsegment can then be regarded as the "topic"of the given segment; items which may beunderstood as the "topic(s)" of the dis-course can then be computed on the base ofthe 'topic(s)" of the segments.The ideas outlined in Sect.
2 and 3will be i l lustrated by an analysis ofmult i far ious examples; the results of thosesections will serve as a theoretical basefor further practical appl ications invarious systems.There are two competitors in the firstsentence, both NP's.
The antecedent of theell ipsis in the second sentence is thesubject of the first sentence.The antecedents of relative pronouns areeasy to compute, too.
By a thorough inves-t igation of a large amount of technicaltexts we found that relative pronouns almostcertainly (about 90-95 %) refer to the headof the closest preceding NP which hasappropriate morphematic categories (gender,number,etc.
):"Pou~iv&me disk z polykarbonAtu, ~ Jsmepgedem oSisti l i .
""We use a ~ of a polycarbonate whichwe've cleaned before.
"An important role is played also by atendency to keep the syntactic dependencyhierarchy in referring - the antecedent of apronoun in the subordinate clause is to befound on the higher or equal layer of thehierarchy:"Pro r~,  u~ivan~ syst@mem s rutinou, kter&mu pom&h~, m~e.
.
.
""The r o ~  used by the system with theroutine which helps it,  can..."Here, the pronoun "it" refers to "program"rather than to "system".2.I SSK can help to solve the referentassignment in discourse analysis.
If we wantto show a most suitable way of applicationof SSK in the context of other usual methodsof solving this problem, we should remindfirst , f all the assignment based on syn-tactic relations:In Czech coordinated clauses the subjectof the second (or third, fourth etc.)
clauseis usual ly deleted.
Then it is (more orless) unambiguously understood to be thesame as the subject of the first clause.
Thesame holds for two successive sentences ,e.g.
:"Digltal lzace je velml popul&rnl trend.
(6) St&v& se symbolem kval itnlho z&znamu proposlucha~e.
""Di~ital ization is a very popular trend.Tt becomes the symbol of the recordingquality for l isteners.
"2.2 When working within the frameworkof the functional generative description(see Sgall, HaJi~ov& and Panevov&, 1986),the solution of anaphora can be supported bythe topic-focus art iculation and the hierar-chy of activation of the items of the SSK.A good help for f inding the pronoun'santecedent is the form of the pronoun usedin the text.
The strong form of a pronoun(ten, tento = this; sebe = himself; .
.
.)
re-fers - in technical texts almost unamblgu-ously - to the focus of the precedingsentence, the weak (unstressed) form impliesreferring preferably to the topic:"Nejslab~Im 5l&nkem v cel~m ~et~zu je vs t~.Ten Je pPi~inou mnoha probl~m8.

""The system calls a recursive program.
Youcan use it ,... "/ "it" refers to "system" in primary case/;The antecedent is not "DAT players", whichcan be computed only on the basis of factualknowledge - if you know DAT's are newer thanCD's.These strategies are relatively reliable(80-85%) and can be used in discourse ana-lysis.2.3 When we take into account alsoother aspects of the role of SSK in dis-course analysis,  we can base the algorithmof reference assignment on the fol lowingstrategies:(I) if the subject of the sentence hasa null form, the subject of the precedingclause is referred to, as long as the gram-matical agreement is preserved;(2) in case of a relative pronoun wetry to find the head of the closest preced-ing noun phrase as the antecedent;(3) if the referr ing expression is a' weak pronoun, we look for the antecedent inthe topic of the preceding clause, in caseof a strong pronoun (or "adjective pronoun"in the noun phrase as "this man") we in-vestigate the focus;(4) if there are more competitors afterstep (3) or if none of the steps (I) through(3) can be used, we apply SSK in the form ofa list of NP's from the preceding text (fromthe beginning of the actual paragraph) withtheir respective degrees of activity andchoose the most activated item with thecongruent morphological  categories.
If wecannot find an item "activated enough" (theconcrete value, or the difference of values,is to be determined independently on the waythe activation is evaluated), we preferleaving the anaphora unresolved in order toprevent wrong solutions of the "global"references (to a preceding clause, sentence,an action identif ied by a verb, a coordi-nation of items etc.)
or references whichcannot be solved without the use of sem-antics, e.g.:3.
The discourse production has morefreedom than analysis, because the speakercan choose the means while describing hisideas.
Of course, he has to take care of thehearer to enable him to interpret the texteasily and, if possible, unambiguously; atthe same time, he should not repeat unneces-sarily definite NP's.
The main criterion inthe speaker's choice between the use of apronoun and a definite NP may be the actualstate of SSE.
We deal with technical textsonly but we believe the basic ideas hold forother types of texts as well.3.1 When producing a sentence of acontinuous text, the speaker can use threetypes of referring expressions - weak pro-nouns, strong pronouns (including the demon-strative and relative ones) and more or lesscomplex definite expressions (compare "John"with "the boy who played with a ball yester-day as I have told you...").
Depending onthe actual state of SSK he chooses therelatively "weakest" means (from a weakpronoun to a complex description) the use ofwhich enables the hearer to find the refer-ent correctly.
Two aspects of SSK are im-portant in this choice:(a) the degree of activation /da(0)of the object (referent) in SSK - an im-portant role is played by the minimal degreeof activation (MIN), i.e., the thresholdbelow which it is not possible to refer toobjects by pronouns (see 1.2);(b) the existence of "competitors" -i.e.
objects differing in activation only bydegree ~ (see Haj i~ov~ and Vrbov~, 1982) andhaving the same morphological categories.

""The PAT l a ~  are much more expensivethan CD players.
This new device is not yetaccepted by producers.
"3.2 We claim that on the background ofthese two aspects we can find the fol lowingfour cases involved in discourse production:(i) da(O)~ MIN (as a special case thisholds for "new objects"):146 3In a technical text, the speaker  prefers touse a definite NP.
The degree of its com~plexlty depends on the presence of possiblecompetitors.

;(b) the expression referring to 01 has theposition of subject in C:When referring to 01, a strong pronoun hasto be used, in case of 02 a weak pronounwill do.
(ii) da(O)>MIN and the object 0 has nocompetitor or the competitor is"far enough":A weak pronoun can be used in this case.

""The input data (0) are changed by theD-TYPE program.
It transforms them (0) intoa special type.
";(iii) da(O1)>MIN , the object 01 has acompetitor 02, none of them hav-ing the maximum degree of activ-ation (MA_~X) :In this case a pronoun does not help.
Adefinite NP (at least for one object) has tobe used.

The solution ofthe problem is the same as in (iii).

""Both s~stems (01 ) differ in util it ies (02).The difference will take place if we try tostart the s t _~(O1) /u t i l l t i es (02) . "
;(iv) da(O1)=MAX , da(O2)=MAX-1 and 01competes with 02:This is the most dlff leult situation.
We candivide it into three subcases by the wayreferring expressions are used in the fol-lowing clause (sentence) C:3.3 As we have already stated, ourstudy is the first step on the way to acomplex account of the impact of SSK in dis-course production.
To handle the interplaybetween pronouns and definite NP's in alldetails, one has to state the relevant dif-ferences in the activation of competitors(in various types of sentences), to considerthe possibi l ity of the marked use of strongpronouns and definite NP's and many otherproblems.
(a) the expression referring to 02 has theposition of subject in C:Here we face the "subject-preserving tenden-cy", which is very common in continuoustexts.
This helps to avoid the possibleambiguity between competitors so that weakpronouns can refer to both objects (01 ,02).
