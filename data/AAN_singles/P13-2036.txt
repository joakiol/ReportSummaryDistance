entities.
Our key contributionis building an automatic classifier to dis-tinguish temporal and atemporal entitiesthen align them in separate procedures toboost translation accuracy by 6.1%.1 IntroductionNamed entity translation discovery aims at map-ping entity names for people, locations, etc.
insource language into their corresponding names intarget language.
As many new named entities ap-pear every day in newspapers and web sites, theirtranslations are non-trivial yet essential.Early efforts of named entity translation havefocused on using phonetic feature (called PH)to estimate a phonetic similarity between twonames (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Li et al, 2004;Virga and Khudanpur, 2003).
In contrast, someapproaches have focused on using context feature(called CX) which compares surrounding wordsof entities (Fung and Yee, 1998; Diab and Finch,2000; Laroche and Langlais, 2010).Recently, holistic approaches combining suchsimilarities have been studied (Shao and Ng, 2004;You et al, 2010; Kim et al, 2011).
(Shao andNg, 2004) rank translation candidates using PHand CX independently and return results with thehighest average rank.
(You et al, 2010) computeinitial translation scores using PH and iterativelyupdate the scores using relationship feature (calledR).
(Kim et al, 2011) boost You?s approach by ad-ditionally leveraging CX.More recent approaches consider temporal fea-ture (called T) of entities in two corpora (Klemen-tiev and Roth, 2006; Tao et al, 2006; Sproat et0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50050100150200250300WeekFrequencyEnglishChinese(a) Temporal entity: ?Usain Bolt?0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50020406080WeekFrequencyEnglishChinese(b) Atemporal entity: ?Hillary Clinton?Figure 1: Illustration on temporalityal., 2006; Kim et al, 2012).
T is computed us-ing frequency vectors for entities and combinedwith PH (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Tao et al,2006).
(Sproat et al, 2006) extend Tao?s approachby iteratively updating overall similarities usingR.
(Kim et al, 2012) holistically combine all the fea-tures: PH, CX, T, and R.However, T used in previous approaches is agood feature only if temporal behaviors are ?sym-metric?
across corpora.
In contrast, Figure 1 il-lustrates asymmetry, by showing the frequenciesof ?Usain Bolt,?
a Jamaican sprinter, and ?HillaryClinton,?
an American politician, in comparablenews articles during the year 2008.
The former ismostly mentioned in the context of some temporalevents, e.g., Beijing Olympics, while the latter isnot.
In such case, as Hillary Clinton is a famous fe-male leader, she may be associated with other Chi-nese female leaders in Chinese corpus, while suchassociation is rarely observed in English corpus,which causes asymmetry.
That is, Hillary Clin-ton is ?atemporal,?
as Figure 1(b) shows, such thatusing such dissimilarity against deciding this pairas a correct translation would be harmful.
In clearcontrast, for Usain Bolt, similarity of temporal dis-201tributions in Figure 1(a) is a good feature for con-cluding this pair as a correct one.To overcome such problems, we propose a newnotion of ?selective temporality?
(called this fea-ture ST to distinguish from T) to automaticallydistinguish temporal and atemporal entities.
To-ward this goal, we design a classifier to distinguishtemporal entities from atemporal entities, basedon which we align temporal projections of entitygraphs for the temporal ones and the entire entitygraphs for the atemporal ones.
We also proposea method to identify the optimal window size fortemporal entities.
We validate this ?selective?
useof temporal features boosts the accuracy by 6.1%.2 PreliminariesOur approach follows a graph alignment frame-work proposed in (You et al, 2010).
Our graphalignment framework consists of 4 steps.2.1 Step 1: Graph ConstructionWe first build a graph G = (V,E) from each lan-guage corpus, where V is a set of entities (nodes)and E is a set of co-occurrence relationships (un-weighted edges) between entities.
We consider en-tities occurring more than ?
times as nodes and en-tity pairs co-occurring more than ?
times as edges.To identify entities, we use a CRF-based namedentity tagger (Finkel et al, 2005) and a Chineseword breaker (Gao et al, 2003) for English andChinese corpora, respectively.2.2 Step 2: InitializationGiven two graphs Ge = (Ve, Ee) and Gc =(Vc, Ec), we initialize |Ve|-by-|Vc| initial similar-ity matrix R0 using PH and CX for every pair(e, c) where e ?
Ve and c ?
Vc.For PH, we use a variant of Edit-Distance (Youet al, 2010) between English entity and a ro-manized representation of Chinese entity calledPinyin.
ForCX, the context similarity is computedbased on entity context which is defined as a set ofwords near to the entity (we ignore some wordssuch as stop words and other entities).
We com-pute similarity of the most frequent 20 words foreach entity using a variant of Jaccard index.
To in-tegrate two similarity scores, we adopt an averageas a composite function.We finally compute initial similarity scores forall pairs (e, c) where e ?
Ve and c ?
Vc, and buildthe initial similarity matrix R0.2.3 Step 3: ReinforcementWe reinforceR0 by leveragingR and obtain a con-verged matrix R?
using the following model:Rt+1(i,j) = ?R0(i,j) + (1?
?)?(u,v)k?Bt(i,j,?
)Rt(u,v)2kThis model is a linear combination of (a) the initialsimilarity R0(i,j) of entity pair (i, j) ?
Ve ?
Vc and(b) the similarities Rt(u,v) of their matched neigh-bors (u, v) ?
Ve ?
Vc where t indicates iteration,Bt(i, j, ?)
is an ordered set of the matched neigh-bors, and k is the rank of the matched neighbors.?
is the coefficient for balancing two terms.However, as we cannot assure the correctlymatched neighbors (u, v), a chicken-and-eggdilemma, we take advantage of the current simi-larity Rt to estimate the next similarity Rt+1.
Al-gorithm 1 describes the process of matching theneighbors where N(i) and N(j) are the sets ofneighbor nodes of i ?
Ve and j ?
Vc, respectively,andH is a priority queue sorting the matched pairsin non-increasing order of similarities.
To guaran-tee that the neighbors are correctly matched, weuse only the matches such that Rt(u,v) ?

H.pop()5: if neither u nor v are matched yet then6: M ?M ?
{(u, v)}7: end if8: end while9: return M2.4 Step 4: ExtractionFrom R?, we finally extract one-to-one matchesby using simple greedy approach of three steps:(1) choosing the pair with the highest similarityscore; (2) removing the corresponding row andcolumn from R?
; (3) repeating (1) and (2) untilthe matching score is not less than a threshold ?.3 Entity Translation Discovery usingSelective TemporalityOverall Framework: We propose our frameworkby putting together two separate procedures fortemporal and atemporal entities to compute theoverall similarity matrix R202We first build two temporal graphs from the cor-pora within every time window, optimized in Sec-tion 3.1.
We then compute the reinforced matrixR?s obtained from the window starting at the time-stamp s. To keep the best match scores amongall windows, we update R using the best similar-ity among ?s,R?s .
we then extract the candidatetranslation pairs Mours by running step 4.As there can exist atemporal entities in Mours,we classify them (Section 3.2).
Specifically, webuild two entire graphs and computeR?.
We thendistinguish temporal entities from atemporal onesusing our proposed metric for each matched pair(i, j) ?
Mours and, if the pair is atemporal, R(i,j)is updated as the atemporal similarity R?
(i,j).From the final matrixR, we extract the matchedpairs by running step 4 with R once again.3.1 Projecting Graph for Temporal EntitiesWe first project graphs temporally to improvetranslation quality for temporal entities.
As theoptimal projection would differ across entities, wegenerate many projected graphs by shifting timewindow over all periods, and then identify the bestwindow for each entity.The rest of this section describes how we setthe right window size w. Though each entity mayhave its own optimal w, we find optimizing foreach entity may negatively influence on consider-ing relationships with entities of different windowsizes.
Thus, we instead find the optimal windowsize w?
to maximize the global ?symmetry?
of thegiven two graphs.We now define ?symmetry?
with respect to thetruth translation pair M .
We note it is infeasi-ble to assume we have M during translation, andwill later relax to consider how M can be approx-imated.Given a set of graph pairs segmented by theshifted windows{(G(0,w)e , G(0,w)c ), ?
?
?
, (G(s,s+w)e , G(s,s+w)c ),(G(s+?s,s+?s+w)e , G(s+?s,s+?s+w)c ), ?
?
?
},where s is the time-stamp, our goal is to find thewindow size w?
maximizing the average symmetryS of graph pairs:w?
= arg max?w(?s S(G(s,s+w)e , G(s,s+w)c ;M)N)Given M , symmetry S can be defined for (1)node and (2) edge respectively.
We first define thenode symmetry Sn as follows:Sn(Ge, Gc;M) =?
(e,c)?Ve?Vc I(e, c;M)max{|Ve|, |Vc|}where I(u, v;M) to be 1 if (u, v) ?
M , 0 other-wise.
High node symmetry leads to accurate trans-lation in R0 (Initialization step).
Similarly, we de-fine the edge symmetry Se as follows:Se(Ge, Gc;M) =?(e1,e2)?Ee?
(c1,c2)?Ec I(e1, c1;M)I(e2, c2;M)max{|Ee|, |Ec|}In contrast, high edge symmetry leads to accuratetranslation in R?
(Reinforcement step).We finally define the symmetry S as theweighted sum of Sn and Se with parameter ?
(em-pirically tuned to 0.8 in our experiment).S(Ge, Gc;M) =?Sn(Ge, Gc;M) + (1?
?
)Se(Ge, Gc;M)However, as it is infeasible to assume we havethe truth translation pair M , we approximate Musing intermediate translation results Mours com-puted at step 4.
To insert only true positive pairs inMours, we set threshold higher than the optimizedvalue from the step 4.
We found out that symmetryfrom Mours closely estimates that from M :S(Ge, Gc;M) ?
S(Ge, Gc;Mours)Specifically, observe from Table 1 that, given amanually built ground-truth set Mg ?
M as de-scribed in Section 4.1, S(Ge, Gc;Mours) returnsthe best symmetry value in two weeks for personentities, which is expectedly the same as the resultof S(Ge, Gc;Mg).
This suggests that we can useMours for optimizing window size.Weeks 26 13 4 2 1Mg .0264 .0276 .0303 .0318 .0315Mours .0077 .0084 .0102 .0113 .0107Table 1: Symmetry of window size3.2 Building ClassifierWe then classify temporal/atemporal entities.
Asa first step, we observe their characteristics: Tem-poral entities have peaks in the frequency distri-bution of both corpora and these peaks are aligned,while such distribution of atemporal entities aremore uniform and less aligned.203Based on these observations, we identify thefollowing criteria for temporal entities: (1) Theirtwo distributions m in English corpus and n inChinese corpus should have aligned peaks.
(2)Frequencies at the peaks are the higher the better.For the first criterion, we first normalize the twovectors m?
and n?
since two corpora have differentscales, i.e., different number of documents.
Wethen calculate the inner product of the two vectorsx = ?m?, n?
?, such that this aggregated distributionx peaks, only if both m?
and n?
peak at the sametime.For the second criterion, we have a spectrumof option from taking the frequencies at all peaksin one extreme, to taking only the maximum fre-quency in another extreme.
A metric representingsuch a spectrum is p-norm, which represents sumwhen p = 1 and maximum when p = ?.
We em-pirically tune the right balance to distinguish tem-poral and atemporal entities, which turns out to bep = 2.2.Overall, we define a metric d(m,n) which sat-isfies both criteria as follow:d(m,n) =( n?i=1(m?in?i)p) 1pFor instance, this measure returns 0.50 and 0.03for the distributions in Figure 1(a) and (b), respec-tively, from which we can determine the transla-tion of Figure 1(a) is temporal and the one of Fig-ure 1(b) is atemporal.4 Experimental Evaluation4.1 Experimental SettingsWe obtained comparable corpora from Englishand Chinese Gigaword Corpora (LDC2009T13and LDC2009T27) published by the Xinhua NewsAgency during the year 2008.
From them, we ex-tracted person entities and built two graphs, Ge =(Ve, Ee) and Gc = (Vc, Ec) by setting ?
= 20which was used in (Kim et al, 2011).Next, we built a ground truth translation pairset Mg for person entities.
We first selected 500person names randomly from English corpus.
Wethen hired a Chinese annotator to translate theminto their Chinese names.
Among them, only 201person names were matched to our Chinese cor-pus.
We used all such pairs to identify the bestparameters and compute the evaluation measures.We implemented and compared the followingapproaches denoted as the naming convention oflisting of the used features in a parenthesis ():?
(PH+R) in (You et al, 2010).?
(PH+CX+R) in (Kim et al, 2011).?
(PH+CX+R+T) in (Kim et al, 2012).?
(PH+CX+R+ST): This is our approach.We evaluated the effectiveness of our new ap-proach using four measures: MRR, precision, re-call, and F1-score, where MRR (Voorhees, 2001)is the average of the reciprocal ranks of the queryresults defined as follows:MRR = 1|Q|?
(u,v)?Q1rank(u,v),where Q is a set of ground-truth matched pairs(u, v) such that u ?
Ve and v ?
Vc, and rank(u,v)is the rank of R(u,v) among all R(u,w)?s such thatw ?
Vc.
We performed a 5-fold cross validationby dividing ground truth into five groups.
We usedfour groups to training the parameters to maximizeF1-scores, used the remaining group as a test-setusing trained parameters, and computed averageof five results.

)4.2 Experimental ResultsEffect of window sizeWe first validated the effectiveness of our ap-proach for various window sizes (Table 2).
Ob-serve that it shows the best performance in twoweeks for MRR and F1 measures.

?Figure 2: The translation examples where shadedcells indicate the correctly translated pairs.outperforms (PH+CX+R+T) by 6.1%.
These im-provements were statistically significant accordingto the Student?s t-test at P < 0.05 level.Figure 2 shows representative translation exam-ples.
All approaches found famous entities suchas ?Hu Jintao,?
a former leader of China, but(PH+CX+R) failed to find translation of lesserknown entities, such as ?Kim Yong Nam.?
Usingtemporal features help both (PH+CX+R+T) and(PH+CX+R+ST) identify the right translation, asKim?s temporal occurrence is strong and symmet-ric in both corpora.
In contrast, (PH+CX+R+T)failed to find the translation of ?Karzai?, the presi-dent of Afghanistan, as it only appears weakly andtransiently during a short period time, for whichonly (PH+CX+R+ST) applying varying sizes ofwindow per entity is effective.5 ConclusionThis paper validated that considering temporal-ity selectively is helpful for improving the trans-lation quality.
We developed a classifier to dis-tinguish temporal/atemporal entities and our pro-posed method outperforms the state-of-the-art ap-proach by 6.1%.AcknowledgmentThis research was supported by the MKE (TheMinistry of Knowledge Economy), Korea and Mi-crosoft Research, under IT/SW Creative researchprogram supervised by the NIPA (National IT In-dustry Promotion Agency).
