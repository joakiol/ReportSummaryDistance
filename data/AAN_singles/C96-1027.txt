In(3)a'.
the antecedent precedes the reflexive, but in(3)b. it is the reflexive that precedes theantecedent; in (3)b. the antecedent c-command thereflexive, but in (3)a'.
it is the other way around.However, contrary to the assumptions of theBinding Theory of Pollard and Sag (1994), also the150definition of binding principles cannot be based onthe SUBCAT valence order.
This is made evidentby (3)a. and (3)a'., whose grammatical status is notcorrectly predicted.
In (3)a., the reflexive is boundby a less oblique element in the SUBCAT list, inaccordance with Principle A, but the construction isnot acceptable.
In (3)b., the reflexive is bound by amore oblique element in the SUBCAT list, inviolation of Principle A, but the construction isacceptable.The solution adopted by Manning and Sag (1995)consists of a three step move: i) to keep the BindingTheory unchanged; ii) to create a new list ofsubcategorized elements, which is named ARG-S(from argument structure); iii) to define o-commandrelations on the basis of the obliqueness hierarchyestablished on this new list, which may be differentfrom the obliqueness hierarchy established in theSUBCAT list.Let us then see how this solution works for theproblematic examples in (3).
In (4) we find thelexical entries of (3) after their reshut~ingaccording to Manning and Sag's proposal (for thesake of readability, the representation ofSUBJ andCOMPS features is omitted).

'Also, pronouns exhibit a special behavior in thecontext of causatives.
Contrary to therequirements of Principle B, in such contextspronouns may be bound by an antecedent occurringin the same clause, but only if it is the subject ofthe causative construction.
This is illustrated in (6)(Iida et al 1994, (17)).

'The solution proposed in (lida et al 1994) foraccounting for the apparent peculiar properties ofbinding constraints in causatives relies on theassumption that he derived lexical representationof a causative verb, like tazune-sase ('made sb.visit'), has the form sketched in (7), where tazune isthe verb 'to visit' and -sase the causative suffix(lida et al 1994, (25)).151(7)PHONSUBCATARG - SCONT-PHONSUBCATARG - SCONTV/ \ [~  NP \[nom\]: nproi, \ [ \ ]  NP \[dat\]: nproj,\ \ [~  NP \[acc\]: ana kcause(i, j, visit(j, k ) )V -sase(tazune) \](DNP\[noml j ,  D}<D, D>visit(j, k)ItazuneConsequently, this solution relies also on thethree basic assumptions adopted fbr the analysis ofToba Batak reflexives: i) the principles of BindingTheory remain invariant; ii) a new list ofsubcategorized elements, termed ARG-S, isadopted; iii) o-command relations are defined onthe basis of the obliqueness hierarchy establishedin this new list.
Moreover, there is a fourthassumption which proposes that Principles A and Bshould be validated in at least one of the twoARG-S features occurring in the derived lexicalentry of a causative verbal brm.Looking at the lexical representation f causativeverbs in (7) and the examples (5) and (6), it is easyto check that Principle A is satisfied in the lowerARG-S list for the binding Ziroo/himself, whereZiroo is the subject, and in the upper ARG-S for thebinding Taroo/himself, where Taroo is now thesubject.
As to the contrast in (6), Principle B issatisfied in the lower ARG-S list, where thepronoun is locally o-tYee.2 Empi r i ca l  Mot ivat ion  fo rBranch ing  Ob l iquenessOnce the binding obliqueness i unpacked fromthe valence list and gets an autonomous status, itbecomes easier to increase the empirical adequacyof Binding Theory, in particular, and the syntax-semantics accuracy, in general.
In this section Iargue this can be done by letting the ARG-S valuehave a non-linear ordering.2.1 Subject-oriented reflexivesThere are languages in which the reflexives,though they must be locally-bound, can be boundonly by a subject.
Examples of such languages areMalayalam and Hindi, IYom India, Lango ti'omUganda, Bahasa fi"om Indonesia, Japanese, Koreanand Russian (vd.
(Pahner 1994, p. 100if) and(Manning and Sag 1995)).

'The solution put forward in (Manning andSag 1995, (6)) to account br this particular sort ofreflexives is to fbrmulate a new binding principle,the A-Subject Principle, where an a-subject isdefined as the "entity that is first in some ARG-Slist":(9) A-Subject PrincipleAnaphors must be a-subject-bound (insome languages).Deciding whether the Binding Theory shouldinclude Principle A or A-Subject Principle dependsthus on the language which it is being applied to.The alternative solution I propose does notinvolve different formulations for bindingprinciples or additional principles.
In this solution,the Binding Theory is kept invariant.
One simplyhas to state that, for those languages, like Lango,that have subject-oriented reflexives, the bindingobliqueness hierarchy is not as sketched in (10)a.,but as in (10)b..
In other words, languages mayvary with regards to the configuration given to theARG-S value.

'Xue, Polard and Sag (1994) discussed at, lengththe properties of this anaphor.
The authorselucidated its particulars, namely that zUi isinherently animate, and ambiguous between adiscourse pronoun and a (syntactic) z-pronoun.

That solution tbllows now naturally andiinmediately from the assumption that theelements of each ARG-S value receive the nonlinear order of (10)b..
Principle Z alone is thus nowenough to make the correct predictions about ziji assoon as the o-command relations arc establishedover the binding obliqueness hierarchy of multi-clausal sentences displayed in (1;{), typical oflanguages with subject-oriented reflexives.

The correctnessof this prediction is cont\]rmed, for instance, byEnglish passives (Pollard and Sag 1994,(\]h. 6, (111)).

This would bean interesting empirical confirmation of the needibr non-linear obliqueness.One such case can be fbund in the context ofRussian passives.
Russian sebe is a subject-oriented refle, xive.
In active constructions it mayhe bound only by the subject.
Nevertheless, in thecontext of a passive sentence,, like (15), sebe canalso be bound by the by-phrase (Manning and Sag1994, (9)).

One such verb isfalar_com_acerca ('talk to about'):(17) a.
A Maria falou com o Pedro acercado novo Director.the Maria talked with the Pedro aboutof_the new Director'Mary talked to Pedro about the newDirector.'a'.
A Maria fhlou acerca do novoDirector com o Pedro.the Maria talked about of the newDirector with the Pedro'Mary talked about the new Director toPedro.
'Given the linear order for the ARG-S value thecurrent theory assumes, it is predicted that if areflexive occurring as the oblique complement Y isgrammatically bound by an antecedent occurringas the oblique complement X, then X is less obliquethan Y.
Moreover, it is also predicted that thereversed binding configuration, where the reflexivewould occur as the oblique complement X, will beungrammatical.
These predictions are sketched inthe following contrast schemata, where si prSprio isa reflexive ruled by Principle A:(18) a.

*A Maria thlou acerca do Pedro/ consigopr6prioi.Maria talked about Pedro/to himselt~This is another puzzle for the current BindingTheory which receives a neat solution with abranching hierarchy for the ARG-S value.
Inparticular, the data presented in (19) receive anadequate account if the ARG~S feature of verbs likefalar_com_acerca is as follows, where the two PPcomplements do not precede each other and areflexive occurring in one of them cannot be boundby an expression occurring in the other:(20) a.\[ARG-S (NP, {PP\[com\]:npro, PP\[acerca de\]:ana}}\]b.\[ARG-S (NP, {PP\[com\]:ana, PP\[acercade\]:npro})\]3 Non- l inear  O-commandAll the solutions proposed for the above bindingpuzzles are similar in the sense that they rest uponthe same two very simple assumptions.
First, theBinding Theory remains unaltered, as defined byPollard and Sag (1994, Ch.
6) with the subsequentspecifications, put forward by Iida, Pollard andSag (1994) and Manning and Sag (1995), that thebinding principles must be validated on at least oneof the relevant ARG-S features.
Second, theelements of ARG-S value may have a non-linearorder.Giving some attention to the first of these twoassumptions, it is worth noting that not only thebinding principles remained unchanged, but alsothe formal notions used in its make-up, (e.g.
therelations of o-command and o-binding) were keptunaltered.
This worked fine in the examplestackled above, but it is expected that a notion likeo-command, ultimately defined on the basis of theprecedence relation, may need some furtherspecification.
This is so because, given the secondassumption that non-l inear ordering~; areacceptable, new cases must be taken into account,154namely those where the re levant  elements do notprecede ach other in the hierarchy.Consider the definit ion of o-command tbr l inearobl iqueness (simplif ied version, (Xue et al 1994,(35)):(21) (Linear) O-commandX O-COMMANDS Y i f fX  is a less obliquecoargmnent of Z that dominates Y.\[n case Z=Y, X is said to LOCAI,LYo-command Y.where X is less oblique than Y iff X precedes Y inan ARG-S lisLThis definition was shown to be adequate for thedata considered so thr.
Notice, however, that  in theexamples above we were mainly concerned with theval idat ion of Pr inciple A. Consequently, in thoseexamples one was checking only whether a given Xpreceded a certain Y.
For this kind of cases, havinga l inear  or a branch ing  obl iqueness makes nodifference tbr the definition of o-command as such.Now, when it  is Pr inc ip le  B that  must  beva l idated,  it must  be checked whether  a givene lement  X does not local ly o-cemmand anothere lement Y. :If X and Y are not in the same ARG-Slist, they do not locally o-command each other,i r respect ive of the option tbr a l inear or a non-l inear  obl iqueness.
However, if' they are in thesame l ist,  assuming  a l inear  or a branch ingobliqueness hierarchy makes a difference.In a l inear  order, two cases occur: e i ther  Xprecedes Y or Y precedes X. '
l 'heretbre, X does noto-command Y iff Y precedes X.
(i.e.
Y is moreoblique than X).
In a branching order, however, athird case also occurs: X is as oblique as Y (they donot precede each other).
Therefore, we would liketo have an empirical basis to ascertain whether Xdoes not o-command Y in this case.Suitable empirical evidence fbr settl ing this issuecomes from the counterpar ts  of the Portugueseexamples in (19), where the rellexive is replaced bytlhe pronoun ele, ruled by Principle B.
(22) presentsexamples where the  pronoun and its antecedentoccur in the same ARG-S l ist and they are equallyoblique.

*A Mar ia thlou acerca do l~edroi corn ele i.Mar ia ta lked about Pedro/ to  him/The ungrammat ica l ly  of these examples showsthat  the pronoun is not locally o-free there and,consequently,  it is not the case that  the localantecedent does not o-command it.The data  fi-om (19) and (22) present  thus theempi r i ca l  bas is  for a proper  de f in i t ion  ofo-command in non-l inear obl iqueness hierarchies.
(19) shows that,  when X and Y are equal ly oblique,it is not the case that  X o-commands Y.
(22), inturn, shows that, under the same circumstances, itis also not the case that  X does not o-command Y.Consequently, the definit ion of the o-commandrelation must be adequately specified fbr branchingobliqueness hierarchies as tbllows (italics indicatesthe specification added to (21)) 2 .
