ukABSTRACTLogical approaches to linguistic description, particu-larly those which employ feature structures, have generallytreated phonology as though it was the same as orthography.This approach breaks down for languages where the phono-logical shape of a morpheme can be heavily dependent onthe phonological shape of another, as is the case in Ara-bic.
In this paper we show how the tense logical approachinvestigated by Blackburn (1989) can be used to encodehierarchical and temporal phonological information of thekind explored by Bird (1990).
Then we show how someArabic morphemes may be represented and combined t .INTRODUCTIONThere is an increasingly widespread view that linguis-tic behaviour esults from the complex interaction of mul-tiple sources of partial information.
This is exemplifiedby the rapidly growing body of work on natural anguagesyntax and semantics uch as the Unification-Based Gram-mar Formalisms.
Similarly, in phonology there is a popularview of phonological representations a having the sametopology as a spiral-bound notebook, where segments (orslots) axe strung out along the spine and each page gives astructural description of that suing according to some de-scriptive vocabulary.
Crucially only those segmental stringswhich are licensed by all of the independent descriptionsare acceptable.The practical difficulty is tO come up with a model ofgrammatical organization which allows the right informa-tion to be brought to bear at the right stage.
One modelwhich looks particularly attractive in this regard considersthe traditional modules of grammar (i.e.
syntax, seman-tics and phonology) not in series where the output of onefeeds into the input of the next, but rather in parallel, whereeach module exerts independent constraints.
For example, amorpheme may be represented as a complex consisting of asemantic expression, a constraint on (morpho)syntactic dis-tribution, and a phonological description.
The combinationof morphemes i then subject to three independent calculi,one per domain.
The result is a compositional account ofthe relationship between form and meaning, as evidencedin the work of Bach (1983), Hoeksema & Janda (1988)and Wheeler (1988).
However, all these proposals have as-sumed that phonological representations are merely linearI We are indebted to Mike Reape, Ewan Klein and membersof the Edinburgh Applied Logic group for discussions of the ma-terial presented here.

Such a restriction renders a theoryincapable of expressing the observations which have beenmade in the non-linear phonology literature (e.g.
Goldsmith1990).
Bird & Klein (1990) and Bird (1990) have endeav-oured m show how the compositional pproach can be lib-erated from a purely linear segmental view of phonology.This paper exemplifies and extends those proposals.The first section presents a logical language for phono-logical description.
The second section shows how it hassufficient expressive power to encompass a variety of obser-vations about syllable structure.
The final section discussesfurther observations which can be made about Arabic syl-lable structure, and provides an illustrative treatment of so-called non-concatenative morphology in the perfect tense'verb paradigm.LOGICAL  FRAMEWORKInterval based tense logics are calculi of temporal rea-soning in which propositions are assigned truth values overextended periods of time s. Three operators F (future), P(past) and O (overlaps) are introduced: F~b means "q~ willbe the case (at least once)", P~b means "~b was the case (atleast once)" and O~b means "~b is the case at some over-lapping interval (at least once)".
O corresponds to whatphonologists call 'association'.
Typically sentences are trueat some intervals and not at others.
(This is obviously thecase, for example, if ~b encodes the proposition "the sunis shining".)
Blackburn (1989) has explored the effects ofadding of a new type of symbol, called nominals, to tenselogic.
Unlike ordinary propositions, nominals are only evertrue once.
In a sense, a nominal is a 'name' (or a 'tem-poral indexical') for that unique period of time at which itis true.
Certain observations about time can only be ex-pressed in a theory which employs nominals.
For example,i ~ -~Fi picks out precisely the irreflexive time flows,whereas no formula containing only propositional variablescan do this.
Nominals have been employed in the analysisof temporal reference in linguistic semantics.
The presentpaper illustrates an application of nominals to a very differ-ent domain, namely phonology.
In addition to F,  P and O,we shall employ the modality O to represent phonologicaldominance a.2 See van Benthem 1983 for an introduction to this field and asurvey of a variety of possible formulations of temporal structure.3 The notion of dominance as eanployed in phonology corre-sponds closely to the use of the term in feature logics.
However.we treat dominance as a relation rather than as a collection of par-tial functions, for two reasons.
First.
in phonological structures, itis the nodes and not the arcs which are labelled.
Second, there canbe multiple arcs emanating from a node.- 89  -Syntax.
Let X = {p, q, r , .
.
.}
be the propositional vari-ables and let N = {i, j, k , .
.

be the nominals of L. ThenL is the smallest set such that all of the following hold,where ?, ~P E L.T,_k E L X ,N  C L<>~b,F?,P?,O?
E L ~b v ?,-~?
E LWe define ---., ,---, and A as usual.
We also define the dualsof our modal operators in the usual fashion: G~b - ~F~?
(~b is always going to be the case), H~b = -~P--,?
(~b alwayshas been the case), C~b ~.
~O--,q~ (~b holds at all overlap-ping intervals) and El~b ~ ~O~b (~b is true at all 'daughter'intervals).
Two additional defined operators will play an im-portant role in what follows: Me = P~b V O~b V F~b, andits dual L?
~_ ~M~?.
It follows from the semi-linear timesemantics adopted below that M~b means '~b holds at sometime' and L~b means '~b holds at all times'.
We will oftenabbreviate <>(p A ~b) using the expression (p)~b and abbre-viate a sequence of such applications (P l ) ' "  (p,,)~b usingthe expression {pl"" "p,)?.
We adopt a similar practicefor the dual forms: \[p\]$ is shorthand for r3(p :...
?)
and\[Pl " "P,,\]$ is shorthand for \ [Pa \ ] ' "  \[P,,\]?.
We also write<)n (or t3") to stand for a length n sequence of 0s  (or 13s).Semantics.
Let T be a set of intervals (which we will thinkof as nodes), and let ~, < and e be binary relations on T.As < models temporal precedence, it must be irreflexiveand transitive, o models temporal overlap (phonologicalassociation), and so it is reflexive and symmetric.
< ando interact as follows: (i) they are disjoint, (ii) for any t l ,t2, t3, t4 G T, tl < t2 o t3 < t4 implies tl  < t4 (that is,precedence is transitive through overlap), and (iii) for anyt~, t2 E T, tl < t2 o rhot2  orb  > t2 (thatis, our concep-tion of time is semi-linear).
Note that the triple (T, <, o)is what temporal logicians call an interval structure.The remaining relation ~ encodes the hierarchical or-ganization of phonological structures.
As a phonologicalunit overlaps all of its constituents (cf.
Hayes 1990:44), wedemand that the transitive closure of 8 be contained withino.
Furthermore, phonological structures are never cyclicand so we require that for any h , .

.tn- l~tn then it is not the case that t,,btl.
By a phonolog-ical frame F we mean a quadruple (T, <, o, B}:of the typejust described.It merely remains to link L with such structures.
Avaluation V is a function (X t3 N) --* 2 T that obeys threeconstraints.
First, it must assign a singleton set to eachnominal.
Second, for each t E T,  there is an i 6 N suchthat V(i) = {t}.
Third, f ib , t2  ~ V(p) wherep ~ Xthen tl o tu ---* t~ = t2.
In short, valuations are functionswhich ensure nominals act as: names, where all intervalsare named, and valuations capture the idea that phonological'tiers' are linearly ordered.
A model for L is a pair (F,  V).Satisfaction.
Let M = (F,  V):, t E T, a ~ X O N. Then:M b ,  " iff t e V(a) M b ,  --,~b iff M ~:  ~bM ~,  ?

then we say that ~b is true in M at :t. Note thatunder this semantics, M really does mean 'at some time'and L means 'at all times' (by virtue of semi-linearity).Validities.
If (F ,  '12) ~t  ~b for all frames F, for all valua-tions V on F, and all t E T, then we say ff is a validity.The following are some examples of validities.

It is straightforward using techniques dis-cussed in (Gargov et al 1987, 1989, Blackburn 1990) toprovide a proof theory and obtain decidability results.
Atpresent we are investigating efficient proof methods for thislogic and hope to implement a theorem prover.EXPRESSING PHONOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTSFeature Matrices.
L can be used for describing featurematrices.
For example, consider the matrix below.\[ PHON (Kay, pats, Blackle) \]A possible description of this matrix is: (PHON)(Kay AFi) A (PHON)(pats A i A F j) A (PHON)(Blackie A j).
Thisrepresentation of sequences (cf.
Rounds & Manaster-Ramer1987) enables the expression of partial ordering constraintswhich are widely required in phonological descriptions.
Notethat all instances of the following variant of the NOM schemaare valid.
E and E' are strings of modal operators from{<>, F, P,O}.

.--, E(i A ?)
A E'i.Formulas may be transferred between different p~hsto the same interval.4The mirror image of this formula, obtained by replacing allFs with Ps, is also valid.- 90 -This schema expresses a familiar equivalence on featurematrices.
For example: \[,,,,o, \[\[\]That is, nominals may be used in the representation f reen-trancy (Bird 1991),Sort Lattices.
Node labels in phonologists' diagrams (e.g.see example (1)) can be thought of as classifications.
Forexample, we can think of p E X as denoting a certainclass of nodes in a phonological structure (the mora nodes).Moras may be further classified into onset moras and codamoras, which are written as Po and/~c respectively.
Therelationship between /~, Po and Pc can then be expressedusing the following formulas:L(p .-.
po v pc) L(po A pc .-- i )Such constraints are Boolean constraints.
For example, asimple Boolean lattice validating the two formulas con-cerning moras above is ( {p, #o, #c, _L} ; po I-1 pc = .L,po LJ pc = # ).
This is depicted as a diagram as follows:~o G3.Each element of X appears as a node in the diagram.
Thejoin (U) of two sorts p and q is the unique sort found byfollowing lines upwards from p and q until they first con-nect, and conversely for the meet (I-1).
For convenience,constraints on node classifications will be depicted usinglattice diagrams of the above form.
Trading on the fact thatL contains propositional calculus, Boolean constraints canbe uniformly expressed in L as follows:(i) p I-I q = r becomes L(p A q ~ r)(ii) p U q = r becomes L(p V q .-.
r)Appropriateness Constraints.
As we shall see, the hi-erarchical prosodic structures of phonology are highly con-strained.
For example, syllables dominate moras and not theother way around, and so a structure where there is a moradominating a syllable is ill-formed.
Following (Bird 1990),we express these restrictions on dominance by augmentingthe sort lattice with a binary' appropriateness' relation A,represented graphically using arrows.
We can express inL the constraints captured by such appropriateness graphs.For example, L(p --, -~Oq) expresses the fact that a nodewith sort p cannot dominate a node with sort q.
We canalso use L to express stronger ?o~traints.
For example,L(p - .
Oq) expresses the fact that a node of sort p mustdominate at least one node of sort q.
In short, the O oper-ator allows us to express graphical constraints.A THEORY OF PHONOLOGYA phonological theory is a collection of generalizationsexpressed in a language of the above logic.
We choose asour language X = tr, O'h, ell, ao, trc, (rho, ~rhc, alo, ale, p,/to, Pc, 7r, Xc, xv, b, d, h, J, k, n, r, s, t, w, ?, a, u, I. Thenine tr symbols are for the classification of syllables intoheavy vs. light and open vs. closed and their various crossclassifications.
We have already been introduced to p, Poand pc, for moras, onsets and codas respectively.
The re-maining symbols are classifications of segments (x), firstlyinto vowels Orv) vs. consonants (xc), and then into theindividual segments themselves (in boldface).
This classi-fication is depicted in (2) below.Syllable Structure.
Phonological representations for sta,tat, taat and ast are given in (1) 5.

We shall rule these out by stating in Lour empirical generalizations.
We begin by specifying (i)the relationship between the sorts (i.e.
the set X)  using asort lattice and (fi) how the sorts interact with dominanceusing an appropriateness relation.
We then express in L theconstraints graphically represented in the appropriatenessgraph in (2).

w a u i..LThe arrows may be glossed as follows: (i) all syl-lables must dominate an onset more~ (ii) heavy syllablesmust dominate a coda mora and (iii) all moras must dom-inate a segmenL The fact that potential arrows are absentalso encodes constraints.
For example: (i) syllables, morasand segments alike cannot dominate syllables and (ii) lightsyllables do not have coda moras.
Constraints concern-ing the number of nodes of sort p that a node of sort q candominate, and constraints concerning temporal organizationcannot be stated in this graphical style.
Nevertheless, theycan be expressed in L as follows.
(A I )  L((po)/p - -~  \[po\]~b).
Onsets are unique.SSe?

(A3)  L(i Acr A (p) j  --~ -~M("~i A (#)j)) .Two syllables cannot share a mora.An interesting alternative is to add an operator <>-1 thatlooks backwards along the dominance relationS.
: The con-straint that two syllables cannot share a mora could thenbe written L(# A ((r)-l~b ---, \[cr\]-l~b).
There are furtherphonological phenomena which suggest hat this may be aninteresting extension of L to explore.
For example, the re-quirement that all moras and segments must be linked to thehierarchical structure (prosodic licensing) may be expressedthus: L((# v 7r) ~ O-IT).Partiality.
Crucially for the analysis of Arabic, it is pos-sible to have a formula which describes more than one di-agram.
Consider the formula M(a  A (#, x ) ( tA  Fi))  AM(trA (th ~r)(aA i)), which may be glossed 'there is a syl-lable which dominates a t, and a syllable which dominatesan a, and the t is before the a'.

Amorphologically complex form must be expressed as the?
intercalation of its component morphemes.
An exampleof this phenomena is illustrated in Figure 1 for the per-fective active r. Consider the form kattab in the secondrow.
Its particular arrangement of four consonants and twoe That is, O-1 is to O as P is to F.7 Note that these are uninflected forms.
Some forms are actu-ally non-existent (for semantic reasons); these are i~dicated by adash.
However, this is unimportant since the present interest is inphonological structure and in potential forms.Conj Verb Form GlossI katab wroteII kattab caused to writeHI kaatab correspondedIV _?aktab  dictatedV takattab - -VI takaatab kept up a correspondenceVII _nkatab  subscribedVIII k tatab copiedIX ktabab - -X staktab had a copy madeXI ktaababXII ktawtabXIII kta_w_wab - -XIV ktanbab - -XV kta~_bay - -II dai3.ra j rolledV _tadal3ra j caused to rollXI .d.harjaj - -XIV d.hm3ra j - -F igure  1: Arable Data based on (McCarthy 1981)vowels identifies it with the second conjugation.

It is now widely recognizedamongst phonologlsts that an analysis of Arabic phonologymust pay close attention to syllable structure s .

A (rv)~b).Onsets must have a consonant and a vowel, in thatorder.There are certain phonological phenomena which appear tomove us beyond the bounds of L: the need to specify de-faults.
Phonologists often employ default consonants andvowels, which appear when the consonant or vowel posi-tions in syllable structures have not been filled.
In Arabic,the default consonant is ?
(the glottal stop) and the defaultvowel is a.
The default consonant only appears word ini-tially.
There are two ways we can treat such defaults.
First,we can regard them as instructions on how one ought to'compute' with L. That is, we regard them as instructionsto attempt o build certain preferred models.
Alternatively,we could combine L with a default logic.MORPHOLOGICAL  COMBINATIONConsider the forms kattab and dahraJ.
Both consist oftwo closed syllables.
This observation is expressed below.
( I I )  M(ac A i A F j )  A M(ac A j) A L(a --~ iV  j)Similarly, the two consonantisms can be represented as fol-lows.
(Note that i l ,  i2 and iz are introduced in the (KTB)lbrmula as labels of syllable nodes; these labels will bereferred to in the subsequent discussion.

The finalconjunct of (H) requires that there be only two syllables.Consequently, each syllable mentioned in (KTB) has to beidentified with i or j .
There are eight possibilities, whichfall into three groups.
In what follows, i ~ j is shorthandfor L(i *--, j), i.e.
L is rich enough to support a form ofequational reasoning 9.
(i) il ,~ i2 ~ is ~ i or il ~, i2 ,.~ is ~ j .
This wouldrequire a syllable to dominate three distinct conso-nants.
However, fxom (A1), (A2) and (A5), Arabicsyllables contain a maximum of two consonants.
(ii) i~ , .~ is~i , i2~j ; i2~i3~i , i~ j ; i2~i ,  ili3 ,~ j ;  or is ~ i, il .~ i2 ,~ j .
In all of thesecases, we have the following reductio ad absurdum,for some k' E {kl, k2, ks}.M(~, ^  0', ~?

and ; o j, which expands to L(i -40  j).
(ii i) il ~ i2 ~ i, i3 ~ j or ix ~ i, i2 ~ i3 ~ 3.
Itfollows from the above default stipulations that twoof the four consonants of (It) must be identical.
Bya similar process to that used in (ii) above, we canshow that the coda consonant of i is identical to theonset consonant of j .
The result is shown in (5a).

The four con-sonants of (DHRJ) satisfy the requirements of the secondconjugation template (II) without the need for reentrancy.OTHER PHENOMENAConsonant  Doub l ing .
In conjugations IX, XI, XII, XIVand QIV there is a non-geminate doubling of consonants.In the exceedingly rare XH, the second consonant (t) is dou-bled.
In all the ;other cases, the final consonant is doubled.The most direct solution is to posit a lexical rule whichfIecly applies to consonantisms, doubling their final con-sonant.
For example, the rule would take the (KTB) formprovided above and produce:(KTB ' )  M((I~, ~r)AkAFkl))AM((#, 7r)AtAkl AFk2))AM((#;rc) AbAk2AFk3) )AM((#,  rr) A bA k3))It would be necessary to prevent his extended form frombeing used in conjugations 17 and V. since the patternskatbab and takatbab are unattested.The Reflexive Affix.
Conjugations V, VI and VIII aremarked by the.presence of a reflexive affix t. Rather thanviewing these conjugations as basic (as Figure 1 implies),we can treat them as having been derived from conjuga-tions H, IN and I respectively.
As this affix always ap-pears as the onset of a light syllable, we shall represent ithus: M(ct I A (/z, a')t).
This morpheme will actually beexpressed lexically as a function from conjugations to con-jugations which attaches a syllable of the above form tothe existing phonological material of a conjugation.
Theaffix must be ordered relative to the other syllables.
A con-straint encoding the observation that all conjugations endin a closed syllable would prevent he affix from being asuffix.
The fact that the affix is a light syllable correctlyrules out ktattab (V) and ktaatab (VI), leaving only the at-tested forms for (V) and (VI).
A constraint which preventedthe first two syllables of a conjugation both being light (cf.McCarthy 1981:387), easily expressed in L, would rule outtakatab (VIII) leaving only the attested form for (VIII).Extrametricality.
Above we specified conjugation H ashaving a closed final syllable.
Looking back at Figure 1, itwould appear as if all conjugations end in a closed syllable.However, a study of the inflected forms reveals that thisis not the case.
For example, the third person plural ofkattab is kattabu.
From (Tl l ) ,  the b must be syllabifiedwith the vowel to its right.
However, the first person plural- 93  -is kattabna, and the b is syllabified with the vowel to itsleft.
Similarly, the s of staktab is not part of the syllabletak.
It is actually the coda of a previous yllable.
In orderto pronounce this form, ?i is prefixed, producing ?istaktab.Therefore, the conjugations are not merely sequencesof complete syllable templates, but rather they are sequencesbounded by unsyllabified (or extrametrical) consonants.
Thedefinition of lI should therefore be modified to be Mac AM(~?
A (/~o)) A M(@ A (/~)) 10.
This is intended to leaveopen the possibility for the final consonant to be syllab-ified with the second syllable or with the third syllable,while simultaneously requiring it to ultimately be syllabi-fled somewhere.CONCLUSIONIn this article we have presented an application of inter-val based tense logic to 'non-linear' phonology (specifically,'autosegmental' phonology, Goldsmith 1990), and exempli-fied it using data from Arabic (McCarthy 1981).
The chiefdifference between this view of phonology and its purelysegmental predecessors is its use of overlapping intervalsof time.As argued in (Bh'd 1990), the three primitives: dom-inance, precedence and overlap are sufficient o representhierarchically and temporally organized phonological struc-ture.
Here we have taken a standard language of intervalbased tense logic, augmented it with an extra operator <> toexpress phonological dominance, and employed nominalsto enable us to label nodes.
A universal theory of syllablestructure was expressed in L, to which further generaliza-tions were added for Arabic.
We then showed how so-called'non-concatenative' morphology might be treated, and in-dicated how the phonological notions of extramela'icalityand licensing were cashed out.
The analysis of Arabic didnot require recourse to separate consonant and vowel tiers(following Hudson 1986).
Rather, consonantisms (and vo-calisms) are simply partially specified phonological struc-tures which may be combined using logical conjunction.Even so, the exemplification given was for but a tiny frag-ment of Arabic phonology and much work is still to bedone.
For example, nothing was said about he vocalisms.The move from linear to non-linear phonology paral-lels the move from a purely Priorean tense logic in F andP to interval based systems in F ,  P and O.
The view ofphonology emerging from the present study is significantlymore formal than many of its contemporaries (eL Bird &Ladd 1991), and suggests that enhanced modal formalismsmay provide a natural foundation for rigorous phonologicaltheorizing.Finally, there would seem to be good reasons for beingconfident hat complex phonological descriptions can nowbe fully incorporated into feature structure based grammarframeworks.
Reape's (1991) logical foundation for theseframeworks and the phonological arguments in favour ofadopting feature structures (Hayes 1990, Bird 1991) are buttwo parts of the one story.10Note that the exhaustiveness condition L(a ~ i V j) andthe sequencing constraints in the earlier version of (I1) must beexpressed here also.
