Intonation and Syntaxin Spoken Language SystemsPreliminary Draft*Mark SteedmanComputer and Information Science, U.Penn.AbstractThe present paper argues that the no-tion of "intonational structure" as formu-lated by Pierrehumbert, Selkirk, and oth-ers, can be subsumed under the generalisednotion of syntactic surface structure thatemerges from a theory of grammar basedon a "Combinatory" extension to Catego-rial Grammar.
According to this theory,the syntactic structures and the intonationstructures of English are identical, and havethe same grammar.
Some simplifications ap-pear to follow for the problem of integratingsyntax and other high-level modules in spo-ken language systems.Phrasal intonation is notorious for structur-ing the words of spoken utterances into groupswhich frequently violate orthodox notions of con-stituency.
For example, the normal prosody forthe answer (b) to the following question (a) im-poses the intonational constituency indicated bythe brackets (stress is indicated by capitals, andan indication of the perceived contour is given):*I am grateful to Julia Hirschberg, Aravind Joshi, MitchMarcus, Janet Pierrehurnbert, and Bonnie Lynn Webberfor comments and advice.
They should not be held respon-sible for any errors in the translation of their advice intothe present framework.

(LEGumes are a good source of)VITamins.Such a grouping cuts right across the traditionalsyntactic structure of the sentence.
The presenceof two apparently uncoupled levels of structure innatural language grammar appears to complicatethe path from speech to interpretation unreason-ably, and to thereby threaten a number of compu-tational applications.Nevertheless, intonational structure is stronglyconstrained by meaning.
Contours imposingbracketings like the following are not allowed:(2) ~ Three doctors (in ten prefer cats)tIalliday \[5\] seems to have been the first to iden-tify this phenomenon, which Selkirk \[12\] has calledthe "Sense Unit Condit ion", and to observe thatthis constraint seems to follow from the functionof phrasal intonation, which is to convey distinc-tions of focus, information, and propositional at-t itude towards entities in the discourse.
These en-tities are more diverse than mere nounphrase orpropositional referents, but they do not includesuch non-concepts as "in ten prefer cats.
"One discourse category that they do includeis what E. Prince \[11\] calls "open propositions".Open propositions are most easily understood asbeing that which is introduced into the discoursecontext by a Wh-question.
So for example thequestion in (1), What are legumes a good sourceof?
introduces an open proposition which it ismost natural to think of as a functional abstrac-222tion, which would be written as follows in the no-tation of the X-calculus:(3) Az\[good'(sourcd z)legumes'\](Primes indicate interpretations whose detailedsemantics is of no direct concern here.)
Whenthis function or concept is supplied with an argu-ment vitamins', it reduces to give a proposition,with the same function argument relations as thecanonical sentence:(4) good'(souree' vitaminsl)legumes 'It is the presence of the above open propositionthat makes the intonation contour in (1) felicitous.
(I am not claiming that its presence determinesthis response, nor that its presence is necessaryfor interpreting the response.
)All natural languages include syntactic con-structions whose semantics is also reminiscent offunctional abstraction.
The most obvious andtractable class are Wh-constructions themselves,in which exactly the same fragments that can bedelineated by a single intonation contour appear asthe residue of the subordinate clause.
But anotherand much more problematic lass are the frag-ments that result from coordinate constructions.It is striking that the residues of wh-movement andconjunction reduction are also subject to some-thing like a "sense unit condition".
For example,strings like "in ten prefer cats" are not conjoin-able:(5) *Three doctors in ten prefer cats,and in twenty eat carrots.While coordinate constructions have constitutedanother major source of complexity for naturallanguage understanding by machine, it is temptingto think that this conspiracy between syntax andprosody might point to a unified notion of struc-ture that is somewhat different from traditionalsurface constituency.Combinatory  Grammars .Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, \[14\]) isan extension of Categorial Grammar (CG).
Ele-ments like verbs are associated with a syntactic"category" which identifies them as functions, andspecifies the type and directionality of their argu-ments and the type of their result:(6) eats : -  (S\~IP)/NP: eat 'The category can be regarded as encoding the se-mantic type of their translation.
Such functionscan combine with arguments of the appropriatetype and position by functional application:(7) Harry eats applesNP (S\NP)/I'P NP.

Co-ordination might be included in CG via the fol-lowing rule, allowing any constituents of like type,including functions, to form a single constituent ofthe same type:(8) X conj X =~ X(9) I cooked and ate a frog.

In order to allow coordinationof contiguous trings that do not constitute con-stituents, CCG generalises the grammar to allowcertain operations on functions related to Curry'scombinators \[3\].
For example, functions may com-pose, as well as apply, under the following rule(10) Forward Composition:X/Y  : F Y /Z  : C =~.
X /Z  : Az F(Gz)The most important single property of combina-tory rules like this is that they have an invari-ant semantics.
This one composes the interpre-tations of the functions that it applies to, as is223apparent from the right hand side of the rule.
xThus sentences like I cooked, and might eat, thebeans can be accepted, via the following composi-tion of two verbs (indexed as B, following Curry'snomenclature) to yield a composite of the samecategory as a transitive verb.
Crucially, compo-sition also yields the appropriate interpretation,assuming that a semantics i  also provided for thecoordination rule.

(S\NP)/NPCombinatory grammars also include type-raisingrules, which turn arguments into functions overfunctions-over-such-arguments.
These rules al-low arguments to compose, and thereby take partin coordinations like I cooked, and you ate, thelegumes.
They too have an invariant composi-tionai semantics which ensures that the result hasan appropriate interpretation.
For example, thefollowing rule allows the conjuncts to form as be-low (again, the remainder of the derivation is omit-ted):(12) Subject Type-raising:NP : y :-~ S / (S \NP)  : AF Fy(13) I cooked  and you a te~P (S \NP) INP  con j  SP (S \NP) /NP.

.SlipThis theory has been explicitly addressed to a widerange of coordination phenomena in a number oflanguages \[4\], \[13\].a The  rule uses the notat ion of the A-calculus in the se-mant ics,  for clarity.
This  should not  obscure the fact thatit is funct ional  composit ion itself that  is the primitive, notthe A operator.I n tonat ion  in  a CCG.Inspection of the above examples hows that Com-binatory grammars embody an unusual view ofsurface structure, according to which strings likeBetty might eat are constituents.
In fact, ac-cording to this view, surface structure is a muchmore ambiguous affair than is generally realised,for they must also be possible constituents ofnon-coordinate s ntences like Betty might eat themushrooms, as well.
(See \[7\] and \[15\] for a dis-cussion of the obvious problems that this fact en-genders for parsing written text.)
An entirely un-constrained combinatory grammar would in factallow more or less any bracketing on a sentence.However, the actual grammars we write for con-figurational languages like English are heavily con-strained by local conditions.
(An example wouldbe a condition on the composition rule that is tac-itly assumed here, forbidding the variable Y tobe instantiated as NP, thus excluding constituentslike *\[eat he\]vp/g).The claim of the present paper is simply thatparticular surface structures that are induced bythe specific combinatory grammar that was in-troduced to explain coordination in English areidentical to the intonational structures that arerequired to specify the possible intonation con-tours for those same sentences of English.
Morespecifically, the claim is that that in spoken utter-ance, intonation largely determines which of themany possible bracketings permitted by the com-binatory syntax of English is intended, and thatthe interpretations of the constituents are relatedto distinctions of focus among the concepts andopen propositions that the speaker has in mind.Thus, whatever problems for parsing written textarise from the profusion of equivalent alternativesurface structures engendered by this theory, these"spurious" ambiguities eem to be to a great ex-tent resolved by prosody in spoken language.
Thetheory therefore offers the possibility that phonol-ogy and parsing can be merged into a single uni-tary process.The proof of this claim lies in showing thatthe rules of combinatory grammar can be anno-tated with intonation contour schemata, whichlimit their application in spoken discourse, and to224showing that the major constituents of intonatedutterances like (1)b, under the analyses that theserules permit correspond to the focus structure ofthe context o which they are appropriate, such as(1)a.I shall use a notation which is based onthe theory of Pierrehumbert \[8\], as modified inmore recent work by Selkirk \[12\], Beckman andeierrehumbert \[1\], \[9\], and Pierrehumbert andHirschberg \[10\].
I have tried as far as possible totake my examples and the associated intonationalannotations from those authors.I follow Pierrehumbert in assuming two abstractpitch levels, and three types of tones, as follows.There are two phrasal tones, written H and L, de-noting high or low "simple" tones - -  that is, levelfunctions of pitch against time.
There are alsotwo boundary tones, written H~ and L~, denotingan intonational phrase-final rise or fall.
Of Pier-rhumberts ix pitch accent tones, I shall only beconcerned with two, the H* accent and the L+H*.The phonetic or acoustic realisation of pitch ac-cents is a complex matter.
Roughly speaking, theL+H* pitch accent hat is extensively discussed be-low in the context of the L+H* LH~ melody gener-ally appears as a maximum which is preceded bya distinctive low level, and peaks later than thecorresponding H* pitch accent when the same se-quence is spoken with the H* L melody that goeswith "new" information, and which is the othermelody considered below.In the more recent versions of the theory, Pier-rehumbert and her colleagues distinguish Iwo lev-els of prosodic phrase that include a pitch accenttone.
They are the intonational phrase proper,and the "intermediate phrase".
Both end in aphrasal tone, but only intonational phrases haveadditional boundary tones H~ and L~.
Interme-diate phrases are bounded on the right by theirphrasal tone alone, and do not appear to be char-acterised in F0 by the same kind of final rise or fallthat is characteristic of true intonational phrases.The distinction does not play an active role in theprosent account, but I shall follow the more recentnotation of prosodic phrase boundaries in the ex-amples, without further comment on the distinc-tion.There may also be parts of prosodic phraseswhere the fundamental frequency is merely inter-polated between tones, notably the region betweenpitch accent and phrasal tone, and the region be-fore a pitch accent.
In Pierrehumbert's notation,such substrings bear no indication of abstract onewhatsoever.A crucial feature of this theory for present pur-poses is that the position and shape of a givenpitch accent in a prosodic phrase, and of its phraseaccent and the associated right-hand boundary,are essentially invariant.
If the constituent is veryshort - say, a monosyllabic nounphrase - then thewhole intonational contour may be squeezed ontothat one syllable.
If the constituent is longer, thenthe pitch accent will appear at its left edge, thephrasal tone and boundary tone if any will appearat its right edge, and the intervening pitch con-tour will merely be interpolated.
In this way, thetune can be spread over longer or shorter strings,in order to mark the corresponding constituentsfor the particular distinction of focus and propo-sitional attitude that the melody denotes.Consider for example the prosody of the sen-tence Fred ate the beans in the following pair ofdiscourse settings, which are adapted from Jack-endoff \[6, pp.
260\]:(14) Q: Well, what about the BEAns?Who ate THEM?A: FRED ate the BEA-ns.H*L L+H*LHY,(15) Q: Well, what about FRED?What did HE eat?A: FRED ate the BEAns.L+H* LHY, B* LLYoIn these contexts, the main stressed syllables onboth Fred and the beans receive a pitch accent,but a different one.
In (14), the pitch accent con-tour on Fred is H*, while that on beans is L+H*.
(I base these annotations on Pierrehumbert andHirschberg's \[10, ex.
33\] discussion of this exam-pie.
)In the second example (15) above, the pitchaccents are reversed: this time Fred is L+H* andbeans is H*.
The assignment of these tones seemto reflect the fact that (as Pierrehumbert andHirschberg point out) H* is used to mark infor-mation that the speaker believes to be new to the225hearer.
In contrast, L+H* seems to be used to markinformation which the current speaker knows to begiven to the hearer (because the current hearerasked the original question), but which consti-tutes a novel topic of conversation for the speaker,standing in a contrastive relation to some othergiven information, constituting the previous topic.
(If the information were merely given, it would re-ceive no tone in Pierrehumbert's terms - -  or beleft out altogether.)
Thus in (15), the L+H* LIIZphrase including this accent is spread across thephrase Fred ate.
2 Similarly, in (14), the same tuneis confined to the object of the open propositionate the beans, because the intonation of the origi-nal question indicates that eating beans as opposedto some other comestible is the new topic.Syntax-driven Prosody.The L+H# LHZ intonational melody in example(15) belongs to a phrase Fred ate ... which cor-responds under the combinatory theory of gram-mar to a grammatical constituent, complete witha translation equivalent o the open propositionAx\[(ate' z) fred'\].
The combinatory theory thusoffers a way to assign intonation contours entirelyunder the control of independently motivated rulesof grammar.
In particular, the forward composi-tion rule (10) offers the possibility of limiting theconstruction of non-standard constituents accord-ing to the intonation contours on the composedelements.I show elsewhere that this effect can be achievedusing a simple annotation of the composition rulecapturing the injuction "Don't compose across anintonational phrase or intermediate phrase bound-ary".
Application is not constrained by intona-tion, and all rules mark their result with the con-catenation of the intonation contour on their in-puts.
The annotated composition rule correctlyallows the derivation of the non-standard con-stituent Fred ate in example (15), where it is2An alternat ive prosody, in which the contrastive tuneis confined to Fred, seems equally coherent, and  may be theone intended by Jackendoff.
I believe that  this alternativeis informational ly dist inct,  and arises f rom an ambiguity asto whether  the topic of this discourse is Fred or What Fredate.
It is accepted by the present rules.marked with L+H* LHY,, because this string doesnot include an internal phrase boundary.
It willalso accept strings in which the same contour isspread over more lengthy open propositions, uchas Fred must have eaten ..., as in (FRED musthave ealen)(the BEAns).
However, the same rulecorrectly forbids the derivation of such a con-stituent in example (14), because Fred is markedas H.L, ending in an intermediate phrase bound-ary, and thus cannot compose with the material toits right.
Other examples considered by Jackend-off are also accepted by these rules, to yield onlythe contextually appropriate interpretations.Conclusion.According to the present theory, the pathwaybetween phonological form and interpretation ismuch simpler than has been thought up till now.Phonological Form maps directly onto SurfaceStructure, via rules of combinatory grammar an-notated with abstract intonation contours.
Sur-face Structure is identical to intonational struc-ture, and maps directly onto Focus Structure,in which focussed and backgrounded entities andopen propositions ar'e represented by functionalabstractions and arguments.
Such structures re-duce to yield canonical Function-Argument S ruc-tures.
The proposal thus represents a return to thearchitecture proposed by Chomsky \[2\] and Jack-endoff \[6\].
The difference is that the concept ofsurface structure has changed.
It now really isonly surface structure, supplemented by "annota-tions" which do nothing more than indicate the in-formation structural status and intonational tuneof constituents at that level.While many problems remain, both in pars-ing written text with grammars that include as-sociative operations, and at the signal-processingend, the benefits for automatic spoken languageunderstanding are likely to be significant.
Mostobviously, where in the past parsing and phono-logical processing have delivered conflicting struc-tural analyses, and have had to be pursued in-dependently, they now are seen to be in con-cert.
Processors can therefore be devised whichuse both sources of information at once, thus sim-plifying both problems.
(For example, intonation226may largely determine syntactic structure in the \[8\]present sense.
And a syntactic analysis that isso closely related to the structure of the signalshould be easier to use to "filter" the ambiguitiesarising from lexical recognition.)
What is likelyto be more important in the long run, however, isthat the constituents hat arise under this analy- \[9\]sis are also semantically interpreted.
The paperhas argued that these interpretations are directlyrelated to the concepts, referents and themes that \[10\]have been established in the context of discourse,say as the result of a question.
The shorteningand simplification of the path from speech to thesehigher levels of analysis offers the possibility of us-ing those probably more effective resources to filter \[11\]the proliferation of low level analyses as well.References\[1\] Beckman, Mary and Janet Pierrehumbert:1986, 'Intonational Structure in Japanese andEnglish', Phonology Yearbook, 3,255-310.\[2\] Chomsky, Noam: 1970, 'Remarks on nomi-nalisation', in R.
