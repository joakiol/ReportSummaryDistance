Rhetorical relations are claimed to I)e actions, and thus the prolmr objects of inten-tions, although some relations may occur \])e independent of intentions.
Explicit identification ofparticular elations is shown to I)e not always m~cessary when l.his information~ can be cal)tnredin other ways, nevertheless, relations are often useful I)oth in plamfing aml r~cognil,ion.Rhetor ica l  Re la t ions  and  I n tent ionsThere are a number of different ypes of relationships between l)roxima.te segments of language, aswell as a number of terms used to dif|erentiate groups of these types.
For the present l)Url)osesI make no distinction (as do, e.g.
\[Sidner; Moser a.nd Moore\]) 1)etw(,en afflictive and other typesof discourse coherence relations.
Since my primary interest is lit conversation (rather than, say,single producer text),  I also include relations between utterances by (lilli:rent sl)eakers.
Anotherdimension along which a distinction couhl be made is what exactly i.s being related'/ Are relationsbetween explicit spa.ns of language text or between elements of the expressed contents of texts orperhN)s mixes between these categories?
Aga.in, I will not make any such distinctions here, andsimply use the term rhetorical relations to refer to any of these relations.As with other types of linguistic meaning, there are both Semantic and Pragmatic views ofrhetorical relations.
Semantic views concentrate on whether or not a relationship can be inferredfl'om features of the discourse and whal: other in|brmation can 1)e inferred when the relation hol(Isor does not.
Pragmatic  views are more concerned with how a rela.ti(mshil) is established and whateffects this relationship (or lack of relationshil) ) has on the context )  For the purposes of engagingin conversation and relating rhetorical relations to intelltiorts, I take the pragmatic viewpoint asmore central, although both are iml)ortant.From the pragmatic viewpoint, rhetorica.\] relations are the same general kind of thing as speechacts or actions in generM: al)stractions of agent-directed change in the worhl, in this case change inthe conversational nd metM state of the col.,versallts.
The only difl'(qence between speech acts andrhetoricM relations is that the latter a.re exl~lMtly concerned with the linka.g?, of separate segmentsof language.

l wouhl like tothank James Allen and Peter Heeman for helpfid discussions.1This distinction iv also discussed by \[Maylmry\] a.s the distinction between rcl, tion.~ and act.i, although here I willuse these terms more or less synollylnously.132which includes both traditional sl)eech acts and several kinds of rhetorica.l arts.
There are low levelacts which link together utterances into turns a.nd content into units which axe acknowledge(i a,ndunderstood together, as well as a level of a~yumt:nlation acts which link together 1)roposition leveland larger i l locutionary acts.
Argumentation acts include act types such a,s ans'wcriug a questiou,as well as most traditional rhetorical relations.Actions play a useflfl role as ,% concel)tual intermediary between bundles o\[" <)l)serve(l features onthe one hand, and stereotyl)ica,1 causes a.nd efl'ects.
They are ;Llso the \])rol)(~r ()l)jects of intentions,and play a central role in planning, l)lan execution an(I l)lan recognition.
PI;i.nning is the processof selecting a set of actions which, when 1)erforme(l under the prol)er conditions will lea,(l to a.desired state of affairs, or goal.
Plan execution is the process of pertbrming the designated actions,monitoring them for desired effect ~uld repairing or replanning in case of a, l)rol)lem.
Plan recognitiouis the process of reasoning ahout an agent's menta,1 state (including intentions, beliet~, an(1 goals)based on observed actions in context.Intentions are commitments towards a course of action.
\[Bratnlan, 1990\] discusses three rolesthat intention plays in deliberative behavior: serving a,s a motivation for l)lanning, a "filter ofadmissil)ility" on plans and 51rther intentions, a,nd a controller of (:on(luct, motivating executionmonitoring and tel)air and rel)lanning when necessa.ry.Rhetorical relations are thus actions in the worhl (listinguishe(l 1)y conditions on their occurrenceand effects, which will generally l)e changes to the conversational state all(I the I)eliefs of theconversants.
Relations can also be 1)lanned, intended, performed, and recognized.
As with otheractions, relations can be performed intentionally or incidentally.
Of intentiona.l a.ctions, it is alsopossible to draw the distinction made in sl)eech a.ct theory between illocutionary acts, those in whichpart of the intended effect includes a.n awa.reness on the t)art of the hea, rer ()1" this intention, andpcrlocutiouary acts, in which it is only the efi~ct that ma.tters a.n(l not recognition of the intention\[Austin, 1962\].For non-il locutionary acts, the intention of the speaker is not relevant - these actions can beproduced as side-effects of the speaker's intention, so that a determination of the intention is notnecessary to determining whether the act was 1)eribrmed.
For exa,ml)le, the evidence relation of\[Mann and Thompson, 1987\] may hohl \])etween two text spans even if the speaker di(l not inten(Isuch a relation, all that is required is that tlm hea.rer's belief in the nucleus is increase(I thoughthe understanding of the satellite.
For an illocutionary act, on the other hand, the recognition ofcommunicative intention is crucial to understanding.
For exa.mple, the answer elation can only berecognized by attr ibuting to the speaker the intention to answer the question.Is I dent i f i ca t ion  o f  Rhetor i ca l  Re la t ions  Necessary?It is on the following point that tile main criticisnl of bounded sets of sl)e('ch acts or rhetori('alrelations (e.g.
\[Cohen a,nd Levesque, 1990; G rosz a, nd Sidner, 1986; Lochba.u m; I!
ughes a,nd Mc(',oy\])is centered: intuitively, all that is needed tbr successful communica,tion is tha.t the hearer understandthe speaker's end intentions, not that the a.ct types themselves be rec()gniz(,d. This intuition, alongwith the lack of general agreement on the precise set of acts or rela.tions lead some to reject theutil ity of relations aJtogether and concentra.te only on intentions.
While I ha.re some sympathy fi~rthis view, relations are often convenient for inh~re,tia.l purl)oses.
It is not so iml)ortant hat theparticular set of relations use(I 1)e the "right" set, or even tha.t the s(,t be sha.r(~d by tim discourseparticipants, a.s long as both pa.rticipa.nts can r~a.ch a. ha.sic a.gre(~nmnt t)n t.h(~ inl.~md~d ~fli~rts.
Still,relations prove to be a. conveni(~nt intcrm(~(lia.ry b(q.w(~cLi rea.soning a.bout high leve| int, entions a.ndactual surf~tce forms.In light of the preceding discussion, the question of whether hetori(:al rela,tions must be identi-: 133fled can be broken down into two subquestious.
On the one ha.nd, if we are talking about whetherthe semantic relationship is inferable from the resulting discourse representa,tion, the answer musthe yes for illocutionary relations.
On the other hand, it may not 1)e necessary to explicitly rec-ognize the act itself in the interpretation process - this knowledge may be iml)licit within therepresentation.As an example, \[Moser and Moore\] discuss a ro-specificaliou relation which hohls between twopropositions which refer to the same entity.
Thry only consider elati~us which "must be recognizedin order to understand the discourse", yet it seems l)erfectly pla.usil)l(, to claim that an agent couhlrecognize that the propositions pl and 1)2 refer to the same entity E without necessarily representingor noticing any relationship 1)etween pl and p2 (though this relationship would be deducible fromthe individual designations of pl and p2).Rhetor i ca l  Re la t ions  in the  TRAINS SystemIn the TRAINS Conversation System implenmntation \[Allen and Schubert, 1991\], we take a fairlypragmatic approach towards rhetorica.1 relations.
Those relations that are conventiona.lly signalledby surface features (e.g.
by clue words such a.s "so", "no", "okay", purpose clauses) are hypothesizedby the Speech Act Interpreter \[Heeman, 1993\] and used by the DiMogue Manager \[Tra.um, 1993\]to guide further interl)retation.
In the case of more implicit relatiol,ships wr often (Io not identifythe precise relation, merely operating on the sl)ee('h act level tbrms.
()f (:ourse, r(,la.tions (:ould beid(mtilied based on how the content is treated with rcspect to l)revi(~us conteut, but that doesn'tseem helpful presently.
This is particularly true tot subject matter relations.
For example, apurpose clause is nseflfl ior the domain plan recogMzer \[Ferguson anti Allen, 1993\] in incorporatingnew content into an existing (partial) plan, but in the absence of such a cue, the recognizer willstill try to connect the new content to 1)revious content.
It wouhl then 1)e possible to deduce therelations that this item hohls with 1)revious items, but we currently see no need to do this.
As anexample, consider the following possible pair of utterances in a situation in which the expressedcontent is not already in the current plan~ but is easily incorl)orated:(1) Move Engine E1 to Dansville to pick Ul} the boxca,r there, ...(2a) Move Engine E1 to Dansville,(2b) pick up the boxcar there ....In (1), the "to" clause would lead the Sl)eech a.ct interpreter to pr(q)ose a PURI)OSE relation,while no Such relation would be proposed fi)r (2).
(1) might have wider applicability (e.g.
in acase in which it is already known tha.t the boxcar a.t Dansville will be moved) and may be easierto incorporate into a current plan structure (e.g.
for (2a) the planner might choose a differentreason for moving El),  but in the current case these utterances would end u l) with identical planstructures.
Now if relation identification were an explicit task of the system, we could say that apurpose relation was deduced (there a.re of course other possibilities, such as SEQUENCE), thoughcurrently we see no need to assign a particular ela.tion or set of relatiolLs.ConclusionsSmuming up, rhetorical relations, like speech acts, are abstract actions and thus tile prol)er objectof intentions.
They may realize intentions, Mthough, Like other actions, some may be performedwithout having been intended (e.g.
as side effects of actual intentions).
Rhetorical acts have"134as their direct effect a change in hearer's belief (and speaker's belief about hearer's belief, etc.
).The conversational nd mental state will also be cruciM in determining whether elations actuallyhold hetween segments of language.
Identification of relations can often be usefltl in discourseunderstanding, but is not Mways strictly necessary, as several sets of relations Inight lead to thesame results, and often it is not possible to identit), the particular elation uutil after calculatingeffects, in which case there is no flu'ther need tbr labelling the relation.
Which set of relations houldbe part of the working ontology is still an open (luestion, Mthough I wouhl suggest that an approachtoward this question wouhl be to use only those relations which seem useful in interpreting andproducing text.References\[Allen and Schubert, 1991\] James F.
