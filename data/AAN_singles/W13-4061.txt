Rizzo Institute for Creative Technologies University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA 90094, USA {lastname}@ict.usc.eduAbstractWe present an online system that provides a complete web-based sandbox for creating, testing and publishing embodied conversation-al agents.
The tool, called Roundtable, em-powers many different types of authors and varying team sizes to create flexible interac-tions by automating many editing workflows while limiting complexity and hiding architec-tural concerns.
Finished characters can be pub-lished directly to web servers, enabling highly interactive applications.
1 Introduction To support the creation of a virtual guide system called SimCoach (Rizzo et al2011) designed to help military service personnel and their families understand behavioral healthcare issues and learn about support resources, a core virtual human architecture that included a new dialogue man-agement approach was developed (Morbini et al 2012b).
SimCoach is an embodied, conversa-tional virtual human guide delivered via the web and is supported by a flexible information state dialogue manager called FLoReS designed to support mixed initiative dialogue with conversa-tional systems.
Morbini et al(2012a) provide a detailed description of the dialogue manager.
Although FLoReS supports a wide variety of virtual human character behaviors, these must be specified in dialogue policies that must be au-thored manually.
Initially, authoring for this dia-logue manager required coding of policies using a custom programming language.
Therefore sig-nificant training for content authors was neces-sary, as well as substantial support from dialoguesystem developers in managing resources such as training data for the language understanding sys-tem.
To improve the accessibility of the system to non-technical subject matter experts and other creative staff, it became clear that additional tools were necessary.
In this demonstration, we present Roundtable: a web-based authoring envi-ronment for virtual human characters that is de-signed for use by subject matter experts who are qualified for content authoring in targeted do-mains, but who may not possess technical skills in programming or experience in dialogue sys-tem design.
2 Supporting rapid authoring of dia-logue agents for the web Roundtable is a complete web-based authoring system enabling the end-to-end creation, valida-tion, testing and web publishing of virtual human characters using the SimCoach virtual human architecture.
The system provides features that empower many types of authors, team sizes and makeups.
The system allows an author to select from a set of preconfigured 3D character models, model the dialogue policy through behavior tem-plates and more direct subdialogue editing, train and test the natural language understanding com-ponent, render animation performances associat-ed with character behaviors and utterances, and test both text-based and fully animated interac-tions.
Finally, the complete character dataset can be exported and deployed to a live, highly avail-able server environment, where interaction data can be monitored and periodically collected for analysis and refinement, all from within the same browser environment (Figure 1).
The entire sys-tem, from authoring to end-user interaction with372the virtual human character, is web-based and requires only a current web browser for content authors and end users.

Dialogue content management, respon-sible for persistence, search, validation and retrieval operations of all dialogue el-ements including subdialogue networks; information state variables and effects; goals and effects; and dialogue action an-notations that provide the mapping to the action database.
?
Training data management, concerned with managing training items for a data-driven natural language understanding module, as well as providing support for running regressions when updating the training set.
?
Action management, provides data op-erations for managing potentially large sets of virtual human performance-related assets, including utterance text, speech au-dio when not system-generated, annotated nonverbal behavior schedules, as well as non-performance actions which include web-hosted videos, digested web articles, or any arbitrary HTML effect.
?
Deployment management, enabling rapid deployment of locally tested charac-ters to highly available web servers as well as review and data warehousing functions for both analytic and refinement purposes.
The information model is implemented in a re-lational database that fully specifies, relates and allows inquiry and validation of authored infor-mation.
Additionally, a complete web application programming interface (API) powers the Roundtable application, providing a transactional framework for data operations as well as user privilege enforcement, but which also allows application expansion.
The information model also serves to decouple the authoring representation from the data struc-tures necessary to drive dialogue behavior at runtime.
Prior to realizing an authored character in the FLoReS engine, project dialogue data ele-ments are exported into the format expected by the runtime target, a process that we expect to expand in the future to support different dialogue managers and language understanding configura-tions.373Figure 2: The interactive virtual human character published to the web, accessible by current brows-ers.
3 Demo script This demonstration will show how to build a simple conversational virtual human character using Roundtable, from acquiring an account (http://authoring.simcoach.org, free for academic research) to obtaining the URL for the newly created character, and all of the steps in between.
The workflow to build a character is as follows: 1.
In the project module (Figure 1a) we create a new character by providing a unique name and selecting an existing 3D character mod-el.
2.
Opening the newly created project brings up the interaction module (Figure 1b) where we choose from a list of available subdialogue templates that can be used for common dia-logue behaviors (question-answer, greeting, etc.).
The provided Greeting and Goodbye templates are used to define the character?s conversational behavior when initiating and ending an interaction, respectively.
Invoking the Question-Answer template, we can quickly define how the character will re-spond to a specific question or statement.
Each template requires a name and sample text for any user or system utterance.
3.
Following the template-based subdialogue generation, we create training data for the natural language understanding component by providing possible user utterances associ-ated with each user dialogue act in the tem-plates used (Figure 1c).
4.
The last task is to refine system utterances, which are generated automatically during the step of policy authoring, and generate anima-tion data.
From the action module, we can search and inspect all system actions.
For any system action, with a single button click,we can synthesize audio and render anima-tions (Figure 1d).
5.
Finally, we navigate to the test module, compile our character project, and are then able to chat with the new character to ensure expected behavior.
At this point, the charac-ter is ready to be deployed, with its unique URL, and is immediately accessible on the web (Figure 2).
4 Conclusion  We described the Roundtable online authoring framework that has been designed to support non-expert users in rapidly creating embodied, conversational virtual characters of varying complexities.
The tool, being web-based, re-quires zero configuration to get started and au-thored virtual characters can be deployed to In-ternet-facing web servers immediately, expand-ing the reach of many dialogue-driven applica-tions.
