So,one can evaluate the similarity of two graphswith a measure of agreement between judgesclassifying pairs of vertices into two cate-gories (connected or not connected).
Whenapplied to synonymy networks, such measuresdemonstrate a surprisingly low agreement be-tween various resources of the same language.This seems to suggest that the judgementson synonymy of lexemes of the same lexi-con radically differ from one dictionary ed-itor to another.
In fact, even a strong dis-agreement between edges does not necessarilymean that graphs model a completely differ-ent reality: although their edges seem to dis-agree, synonymy resources may, at a coarsergrain level, outline similar semantics.
To in-vestigate this hypothesis, we relied on sharedcommon properties of real world data net-works to look at the graphs at a more globallevel by using random walks.
They enabledus to reveal a much better agreement betweendense zones than between edges of synonymygraphs.
These results suggest that althoughsynonymy resources may disagree at the levelof judgements on single pairs of words, theymay nevertheless convey an essentially simi-lar semantic information.1 IntroductionMore and more resources exist, built with variousapproaches and methods and with many differentaims and intended uses.
A new issue raised by thisgrowth is that of comparing various resources.
Alexical resource is usually based on semantic judge-ments about lexical elements (a human judgementperformed by a lexicographer, or a machine-basedjudgement in the case of automatically built re-sources).
Often, two independently built resourcesthat describe the same linguistic reality only show aweak agreement even when based on human judge-ments under the same protocol (Murray and Green,2004).Many of such resources, such as WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998) or Wiktionary1 (Zesch et al, 2008;Sajous et al, 2010) can be modelled as graphs.
Agraph encodes a binary relation on a set V of ver-tices.
A graph G = (V,E) is therefore defined bya finite, non empty set of n = |V | vertices and bya set E ?
V ?
V of m = |E| couples of vertices(edges).
In the linguistic field, vertices can be vari-ous elements of the lexicon: lemmas, word senses,syntactic frames... and edges can describe variousrelations: synonymy, hyperonymy, translation, co-occurrence... Edges between two vertices can beseen as judgements that decide whether the consid-ered relation applies to this pair.
For example, in asynonymy graph, an edge exists between two wordsif they were judged to be synonyms by the lexicogra-pher who was compiling the dictionary.
So, differentgraphs that model dictionaries of synonyms are builtaccording to the judgements of various ?judges?.We first illustrate, in section 2, how various stan-dard synonymy resources of English and Frenchshare common structural properties: they all are Hi-erarchical Small Worlds (HSW).
However, we then1http://www.wiktionary.org/15show that the synonymy judgements they describeseem to disagree: the Kappa (Cohen, 1960) betweenthe edges of any two such resources remains surpris-ingly low.
In the third section, we analyse this appar-ent disagreement and in section 4, we address it byproposing an alternative view of the networks, basedon random walks.
This more global view enables usto assess if disagreeing synonymy networks never-theless concord at a more global level, because theymodel the same linguistic reality.
Beyond the usualKappa agreement measure, which is based on the lo-cal comparison of two category judgements (a pair isor is not a pair of synonyms), we can show that syn-onymy judgements do not essentially diverge on thelexical semantic structure that emerges from them.In the fifth section, we conclude by outlining possi-ble applications and perspectives of this work.2 Graph modelling of various synonymyresourcesIn order to study the similarities and variations oflexical resources, let us study a sample of graphs thatmodel several standard synonymy resources.
Weanalyse five standard, general purpose, paper dictio-naries of French synonyms2: Bailly (Bai), Benac(Ben), Bertaud du Chazaut (Ber), Larousse (Lar),Robert (Rob).
We also study synonymy relations ex-tracted from the Princeton Word Net (PWN ) andfrom the English Wiktionary (Wik).
The PWNsynonymy network was built according to the fol-lowing rule: an edge is drawn between any twowords that belong to the same synset.
The Wik-tionary synonymy network was extracted from Wik-tionary dumps3 by methods exposed in (Sajous etal., 2010).
Each of these resources is split4 by partsof speech (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives) resulting inthree different synonymy graphs, designated, for ex-ample for the Robert dictionary, as follows: RobN ,RobV , RobA.2Synonymy relations from each of these dictionaries wereextracted by the INALF/ATILF Research Unit and corrected bythe CRISCO Research Unit.3http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/lexiques/wiktionaryx.html4Note that splitting is not necessary.
The following workwould apply similarly to whole resources.2.1 Invariants : similar structural propertiesMost lexical networks, as most field networks5,are Hierarchical Small World (HSW) Networks thatshare similar properties (Watts and Strogatz, 1998;Albert and Barabasi, 2002; Newman, 2003; Gaumeet al, 2010; Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005).
Theyexhibit a low density (not many edges), short paths(the average number of edges L on the shortestpath between two vertices is low), a high clusteringrate C (locally densely connected subgraphs can befound whereas the whole graph is globally sparse inedges), and the distribution of their degrees followsa power law.
All graphs in our sample exhibit theHSW properties.
For example, Table 1 shows thepedigrees of synonymy graphs of verbs(for spacereasons we only show results for verbs, results aresimilar for the two other parts of speech).
In this ta-ble, n and m are the number of vertices and edges,?k?
is the average degree of vertices, and ?
is thecoefficient of the power law that fits the distributionof degrees, with a correlation coefficient r2.
nlccand Llcc are the number of vertices and the aver-age path length measured on the largest connectedcomponent.
Even if n and ?k?
vary across dictionar-ies, Llcc is always small, C is always higher than forequivalent random graphs (Newman, 2003) and thedistribution of degrees remains close to a power lawwith a good correlation coefficient.Table 1: Pedigrees of seven synonymy graphs (verbs).n m ?k?

They contrast with artificial networks (deterministic orrandom).16(V2, E2), in order to compare their lexical cover-ages, we compute the Recall (R?
), Precision (P?
)and F-score (F?)
of their vertex sets:R?
(G1, G2) =|V1?V2||V2|P?
(G1, G2) =|V1?V2||V1|F?
(G1, G2) = 2.R?(G1,G2).P?(G1,G2)R?(G1,G2)+P?
(G1,G2)F-scores of pairs of comparable graphs (same lan-guage and same part of speech) of our sample re-main moderate.
Table 2 illustrates these measures onthe eleven pairs of graphs involving the five Frenchsynonymy graphs (verbs) and the two English ones.It shows that the lexical coverages of the varioussynonymy graphs do not perfectly overlap.Table 2: Precision, Recall and F-score of vertex sets ofeleven pairs of graphs.

edges.
The Kappaof Cohen (Cohen, 1960) is a common measure ofagreement between different judges who categorizethe same set of objects.
In the case of graphs, thejudgements are not applied to simple entities but torelations between pairs of entities.
Two synonymygraphs G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) give twojudgements on pairs of vertices.
For example, if apair (u, v) ?
V1 ?
V1 is judged as synonymous then(u, v) ?
E1, else (u, v) ?
E1.
To measure theagreement between edges of G1 and G2, one firsthas to reduce the two graphs to their common ver-tices:?

(|E?1|.|E?2|+ |E?1|.|E?2|) (3)is the hypothetical probability of chance agreement,assuming that judgements are independent7.The value of agreement on synonymy judgementsKl(G?1, G?2) varies significantly across comparabledictionary pairs of our sample, however it remainsquite low.
For example: Kl(Rob?V , Lar?V ) = 0.518and Kl(PWN?V ,Wik?V ) = 0.247 (cf.
Table 3).
Onthe whole sample studied in this work this agreementvalue ranges from 0.25 to 0.63 averaging to 0.39.This shows that, although standard dictionaries ofsynonyms show similar structural properties, theyconsiderably disagree on which pairs of words aresynonymous.6Here, we do not consider reflexivity edges, that link ver-tices to themselves, as they are obviously in agreement acrossgraphs and are not informative synonymy judgements.7Note that Kl(G?1, G?2) = Kl(G?2, G?1).173 Analysis of the disagreement betweensynonymy networksWhen comparing two lexical resources built by lexi-cographers, one can be surprised to find such a levelof disagreement on synonymy relations.
This diver-gence in judgements can be explained by editorialpolicies and choices (regarding, for example printedsize constraints, targeted audiences...).
Furthermore,lexicographers also have their subjectivity.
Sincesynonymy is more a continuous gradient than a dis-crete choice (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002), an alterna-tive limited to synonym/not synonym leaves ampleroom for subjective interpretation.
However, thesejustifications do not account for such discrepanciesbetween resources describing the semantic relationsof words of the same language.
Therefore, we ex-pect that, if two words are deemed not synonymsin one resource G1, but synonyms in another G2,they will nevertheless share many neighbours in G1and G2.
In other words they will belong to the samedense zones.
Consequently the dense zones (or clus-ters) found in G1 will be similar to those found inG2.
Random walks are an efficient way to revealthese dense zones (Gaume et al, 2010).
So, to eval-uate the hypothesis, let us begin by studying the sim-ilarity of random walks on various synonymy net-works.3.1 Random walks on synonymy networksIf G = (V,E) is a reflexive and undirected graph,let us define dG(u) = |{v ?
V/(u, v) ?
E}| thedegree of vertex u in graph G, and let us imagine awalker wandering on the graph G:?
At a time t ?
N, the walker is on one vertexu ?
V ;?
At time t + 1, the walker can reach any neigh-bouring vertex of u, with uniform probability.This process is called a simple random walk (Bol-lobas, 2002).
It can be defined by a Markov chainon V with a n?
n transition matrix [G]:[G] = (gu,v)u,v?Vwith gu,v =??
?1dG(u)if (u, v) ?
E,0 else.Since G is reflexive, each vertex has at least oneneighbour (itself) thus [G] is well defined.
Further-more, by construction, [G] is a stochastic matrix:?u ?
V,?v?V gu,v = 1.The probability P tG(u v) of a walker starting onvertex u to reach a vertex v after t steps is:P tG(u v) = ([G]t)u,v (4)One can then prove (Gaume, 2004), with thePerron-Frobenius theorem (Stewart, 1994), that if Gis connected8 (i.e.
there is always at least one pathbetween any two vertices), reflexive and undirected,then ?u, v ?
V :limt?
?P tG(u v) = limt??
([G]t)u,v =dG(v)?x?V dG(x)(5)It means that when t tends to infinity, the probabilityof being on a vertex v at time t does not depend onthe starting vertex but only on the degree of v. In thefollowing we will refer to this limit as piG(v).3.2 Confluence in synonymy networksThe dynamics of the convergence of random walkstowards the limit (Eq.
(5)) is heavily dependent onthe starting node.
Indeed, the trajectory of the ran-dom walker is completely governed by the topologyof the graph: after t steps, any vertex v located at adistance of t links or less can be reached.
The prob-ability of this event depends on the number of pathsbetween u and v, and on the structure of the grapharound the intermediary vertices along those paths.The more interconnections between the vertices, thehigher the probability of reaching v from u.For example, if we take G1 = RobV andG2 = LarV , and choose the three verticesu = ?plucher (peel), r = d?pecer (tear apart) ands = sonner (ring), which are such that:?
u= ?plucher (peel) and r= d?pecer (tear apart)are synonymous in RobV : (u, r) ?
E1;?
u= ?plucher (peel) and r= d?pecer (tear apart)are not synonymous in LarV : (u, r) /?
E2;?
r= d?pecer (tear apart) and s= sonner (ring)have the same number of synonyms in G1 :dG1(r) = dG1(s) = d1;8The graph needs to be connected for Eq.
5 to be valid but,in practice, the work presented here also holds on disconnectedgraphs.18?
r= d?pecer (tear apart) and s= sonner (ring)have the same number of synonyms in G2 :dG2(r) = dG2(s) = d2.Then Equation (5) states that (P tG1(u r))1?t and(P tG1(u s))1?t converge to the same limit:piG1(r) = piG1(s) =d1?x?V1dG1(x)as do (P tG2(u r))1?t and (PtG2(u s))1?t:piG2(r) = piG2(s) =d2?x?V2dG2(x)However the two series do not converge with thesame dynamics.
At the beginning of the walk, for tsmall, one can expect that P tG1(u r) > PtG1(u s)and P tG2(u r) > PtG2(u s) because ?plucher issemantically closer to d?pecer than to sonner.
In-deed the number of short paths between ?plucherand d?pecer is much greater than between ?plucherand sonner.Figure 1(a) shows the values of P tG1(u r)and P tG1(u s) versus t, and compares themto their common limit.
Figure 1(b) showsthe values of P tG2(u r) and PtG2(u s) ver-sus t, and compares them to their common limit.These figures confirm our intuition that, since?plucher (peel) and d?pecer (tear apart) are seman-tically close, P tG1(u r) and PtG2(u r) decrease totheir limit.
We call this phenomenon strong con-fluence.
It is worth noting that this remains trueeven if ?plucher (peel) and d?pecer (tear apart)are not synonyms in LarV .
Conversely, since?plucher (peel) and sonner (ring) are semanticallydistant, P tG1(u s) and PtG2(u s) increase to theirasymptotic value.
We call this phenomenon weakconfluence.3.3 Correlation of the confluence ofdisagreeing synonymy pairsWhen two graphs G1 and G2 disagree on a pair ofvertices (a, b) (a is a neighbour of b in one graph butnot in the other) there are three possible cases for thestrength of the confluence between vertices a and b:(1) strong in both graphs (confluence agreement),10 20 30 40 50t : Length of random walk10-510-410-310-210-1Pt (?plucher?)

(2) weak in both graphs (confluence agreement),(3) strong in one graph, but weak in the other (con-fluence disagreement).To contrast cases (1) and (2) from case (3) wemeasure the correlation between the confluences ofdisagreeing pairs of two synonymy networks G?1and G?2.
We compare it to this same correlation ontwo reflexive and undirected random graphs RG?1 =(V ?, ER1 ) and RG?2 = (V?, ER2 ) built such that:|ER1 ?
ER2 | = |E?1 ?
E?2|,|ER1 ?
ER2 | = |E?1 ?
E?2|,|ER1 ?
ER2 | = |E?1 ?
E?2|,19which means that the Kappa agreement betweenRG?1 and RG?2 is the same as between G?1 and G?2.For a given t > 1 and a set of vertex pairs X ?V ?
?V ?, the correlation of confluences ?X(G?1, G?2)is defined by the Pearson?s linear correlation coef-ficient of the two value tables(P tG?1(u v))(u,v)?Xand(P tG?2(u v))(u,v)?X .For all comparable pairs of our sample, wesee that disagreeing pairs tend to have a muchhigher correlation of confluence than disagreeingpairs of equivalent random networks.
As an ex-ample, for G1 = RobV , G2 = LarV andt = 3, we have ?E?1TE?2(G?1, G?2) = 0.41 and?E?1TE?2(G?1, G?2) = 0.38, whereas in the case ofthe equivalent random graphs the same figures areclose to zero.This suggests that even if graphs disagree on thesynonymy of a significant number of pairs, they nev-ertheless generally agree on the strength of theirconfluence.
In other words, occurrences of cases (1)and (2) are the majority whereas occurrences of case(3) are rare.
We propose in the next section an exper-iment to verify if we can rely on confluence to find agreater agreement between two graphs that disagreeat the level of synonymy links.4 Self mediated agreement by confluence4.1 Hypothesis: Conciliation reveals structuralsimilarity beyond disagreement of localsynonymyWe saw in section 2.2 that the rate of agreement be-tween edges of two standard synonymy networksG?1and G?2, Kl(G?1, G?2), is usually low.
However, wehave noticed in Section 3.3 that the confluences ofpairs on which synonymy graphs disagree are sig-nificantly more correlated (?
?
0.4) than the conflu-ence of equivalent random networks (?
?
0).
Thissuggests the following hypothesis: synonymy net-works are in agreement at a level that is not takeninto account by the Kappa measure on edges.To verify this hypothesis, we try to make each pairof graphs conciliate on the basis of confluence val-ues.
We propose a conciliation process by whicha graph can accept the addition of another?s edgesif they do not contradict its structure (i.e.
thereis a strong confluence value).
We then assess if astrong agreement is found between the two resultinggraphs.Let G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) be twosynonymy networks, both reflexive, undirected, con-nected, and a given t ?

E?2?P tG?2(u r) > piG?2 (r)o(7)G(+G2)1 and G(+G1)2 are called accommodatinggraphs.
The construction of the accommodatinggraphs may be metaphorically understood as a con-ciliation protocol by which two graphs accept pro-posals of the other that they can reconsider.
For ex-ample, G(+G2)1 is the graph G?1 enriched by edges(u, r) of G?2 such that there is a strong confluencebetween vertices u and r in G?1The following property is worth noticing:Proposition 1.

The conciliation process depends onconfluence measures that depend on a given t, thenumber of steps of the random walk.
For t = 1,only vertices in the neighbourhood of the startingvertex are reachable.
Consequently only pairs ofvertices that are edges have a non null confluence.Thus Kl(G(+G2)1 , G(+G1)2 ) = Kl(G?1, G?2) whichdoes not help us to contrast conciliated graphs from20initial binary synonymy graphs.
So we fix t = 2the shortest walk length that still yields informativeresults.We propose a control experiment that consistsin applying the conciliation process to random net-works that have the same Kappa as the pairs of syn-onymy networks.
The construction of these randomgraphs is described above, in section 3.3.
We mea-sure the agreement after conciliation of 20 differentrandom graphs.
With this control experiment we as-sess that the observed results are specific to graphsdescribing the same resource, and not a mere bias ofthe protocol (let us imagine a protocol whereby onewould add all the disagreeing edges to the graphs:not only the Kappa of the pseudo accommodatingsynonymy graphs would be equal to one, but also theKappa of pseudo accommodating random graphs,which would disqualify the protocol).4.3 ResultsTable 3 summarizes Kappa and conciliated Kappavalues on the pairs of synonymy graphs of verbs.It shows a significant improvement of agreementafter conciliation.
For example, from a moder-ate Kappa (0.518) between graphs Rob?V and Lar?V(constructed by experts), the conciliation processleads to an excellent Kappa (0.852).
Conversely therandom networks only increase their agreement by0.01 (with a very low standard deviation ?
< 0.001).In English, from a poor (0.247) Kappa betweenPWN ?V (constructed by experts) and Wik?V (con-structed by the ?crowds?
), the conciliation processleads to a moderate Kappa (0.530), whereas the ran-dom networks only marginally increase their agree-ment (0.004).Results are similar for other parts of speech.
Thismeans that the conciliation process significantly im-proves the agreement between resources, even ifthey are originally significantly diverge.It is interesting to notice that the most sim-ilar pairs in terms of edge agreement do notnecessarily produce the most agreeing pairsof accommodating graphs.
For example, thepair(BaiV , RobV ) agrees more than the pair(BaiV , LarV ), whereas for their accommodatinggraphs, the pair(Bai(+RobV )V , Rob(+BaiV )V ) agreesless than the pair (Bai(+LarV )V , Lar(+BaiV )V ).Table 3: Kappa (ori.)

On the other hand,the agreement of random networks does not reallyimprove after conciliation.
This proves that the syn-onymy networks of the same language share specificsimilar structures that can be detected with the helpof confluence measures.5 ConclusionAlthough graphs that encode synonymy judgementsof standard semantic lexical resources share simi-lar HSW properties they diverge on their synonymyjudgements as measured by a low Kappa of edges.So, one could wonder whether the notion of syn-onymy is well defined, or if synonymy judgementsare really independent.
Without directly address-ing this question, we nevertheless have shown thatstrong confluence measures help two synonymygraphs accommodate each others?
conflicting edges.They reach a much better agreement, whereas ran-dom graphs?
divergence is maintained.
Since thegraphs are HSW, they draw clusters of synonymsin which pairs of vertices have a strong confluence.21This suggests two conclusions.
First, different syn-onymy resources that describe the same lexicon re-veal dense zones that are much more similar acrossgraphs than the binary synonymy categorisation (thesynonym/not synonym alternative).
These densezones convey information about the semantic organ-isation of the lexicon.
Second, random walks andconfluence measures seem an appropriate techniqueto detect and compare the dense zones of varioussynonymy graphs.This theoretical work validates the randomwalk/confluence approach as a potentially valid toolfor detecting semantic similarities.
This opens manyperspectives for applications.
For example, it canbe used to enrich resources as was done for theWisigoth project (Sajous et al, 2010).
It may alsohelp to merge, or aggregate, resources.
If we applythe conciliation process to two graphs G1 and G2,obtaining two accommodating graphs G(+G2)1 =(V ?, E+1 )) and G(+G1)2 = (V?, E+2 )) then the graphG = (V ?, E??
= (E+1 ?
E+2 )) could be a mergedresource.
Indeed, G?s set of edges, E??
seems likea good compromise because, according to the prop-erty 1, (E?1 ?
E?2) ?
E??
?
(E?1 ?
E?2).
This newaggregation method would need to be validated bycomparing the quality of the merged resource to theresults of the union or intersection.Furthermore, this work is a first step for defin-ing a similarity measure between graphs, that couldtake into account the structural agreement ratherthan a simple edge-to-edge disagreement.
Subse-quent work should generalise the conciliation pro-cess along several axes:?
The number of steps t was chosen as the short-est possible for the confluence measures.
Itwould be worthwhile to investigate the effectof the length of the walks on the agreement ofthe accommodating graphs.?
Another line of research would be to alter theconciliation ability of graphs, by increasing ordecreasing the criterion for strong confluence.One can for example introduce a k parameter inthe definition of C1 (resp.
C2), in Equation 6:P tG?1(u r) > k.piG?1(r) (9)?
The conciliation process seems unbalanced in-sofar as graphs only accept to add edges.
Itshould be extended to a negotiating processwhere a graph could also accept to remove oneedge if the other does not have it and its conflu-ence is weak.?
The conciliation process could also be gen-eralised to graphs that have different vertices,such as two synonymy networks of differentlanguages.
In that case the issue is not anymoreto reveal a deeper similarity, beyond a localdisagreement, because one can not comparethe graphs vertex by vertex or edge by edge.However, questioning whether the semanticstructures revealed by dense zones are similarfrom one lexicon to another is an interestingline of research.
One approach to compare twosynonymy graphs of two different languageswould be to draw edges between vertices thatare translations of each other.
Random walkscould then reach vertices of the two lexicons,so that the conciliation process could begeneralised to accommodating two synonymygraphs via translation links.AcknowledgementsThe research presented in this paper was supportedby the ANR-NSC (France-Taiwan) bilateral projectM3 (Modeling and Measurement of Meaning).
