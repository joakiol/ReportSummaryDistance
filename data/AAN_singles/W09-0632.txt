The fitness function is a metricthat evaluates each of the possible solutions, en-suring that the average adaptation of the popula-tion increases each generation.
Repeating this pro-cess hundreds or thousands of times leads to verygood solutions for the problem.We encode as a fitness function the specific con-straints required for the reference to be acceptable.The crossover and mutation genetic operators en-sure a reasonable variation between the differentoptions much as a human-generated text would.Each individual is represented by a set of genesthat are the list of possible attributes in the refer-ence.
Each gene has an associated value of 0 (if theattribute is not included in the reference), or 1 (ifthe attribute is included in the reference).
The ini-tial population should have a low number of genesset to 1, because references tend to be short and theuse of all the possible attributes should be avoided.For the crossover operator, two individuals areselected randomly and crossed by a random pointof their structure.
For the mutation operator, someof the genes are chosen randomly to be mutatedfrom 1 to 0, or vice versa.The fitness function must find a balance be-tween the univocal identification of a referent, anda natural use of attributes.
The formula used asfitness function is defined in Equation 1:fitindi = fatti?weightatt+ident?weightid (1)where ident represents whether the reference isunivocally identifying the target among the dis-tractors, and fatti computes the role of attributesas the normalised sum of the weight (dependingon its absolute frecuency in ATTRIBUTE-SETelements in the corpus) of all attributes present(gene=1), as defined by Equation 2:fatti =?geneatti ?
weightatti#attsRef(2)2 Case-Based Reasoning for RealizationTemplate-based solutions for natural languagegeneration rely on reusing fragments of text ex-tracted from typical texts in a given domain, apply-ing a process of abstraction that identifies whichpart of them is common to all uses, and leavingcertain gaps to be filled with details correspond-ing to a new use.
A case-based solution (Aamodtand Plaza, 1994) to reference realization can ob-tain the information needed to realize a referencefrom the original examples of appropriate use thatoriginated the templates.In our approach, a case consists of a de-scription of the problem (ATTRIBUTE-SET) anda solution (ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING inter-preted as a template).
Cases are stored in aCase Retrieval Net (CRN) (Lenz and Burkhard,1996), a memory model developed to improvethe efficiency of the retrieval tasks of theCBR cycle.
Each attribute-value pair from theATTRIBUTE-SET is a node in the net.
Templatesin ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING are consideredas solutions to the cases.
Similarities between thenodes are established for the retrieval stage of theCBR process.
For example, we have consideredthat ?back?
and ?right?
orientation values have ahigher similarity than ?back?
and ?front?
that areexactly the opposite.The attribute-value pairs of ATTRIBUTE-SETthat must be realized in a final string are usedto query the net, which returns the more similarcases.
Only one of them must be chosen to beadapted for the solution.
We consider four differ-ent types of retrieved cases: preferred (cases withexactly the same attributes than the query), more(cases with the same attributes as the query and187String Edit Norm.

The or-der given is the preferred order to chose the mostsuitable case for the query.Adaptation of the chosen case depends on itstype.
The idea is to keep all the parts of the tem-plate that correspond to attributes common to thequery and the case.
Extra attributes in the casethat do not appear in the query are discarded.
At-tributes in the query not appearing in the case arelost.3 Results and DiscussionWe have tested both solutions (evolutionary andcase-based) separately and together in three differ-ent systems, relying on solutions presented in lastyear?s challenge.?
NIL-UCM-EvoTAP.
Selects attributes usingthe evolutionary solution and realises usingthe NIL-UCM-BSC solution (Gerva?s et al,2008).?
NIL-UCM-ValuesCBR.
Selects attributesusing the NIL-UCM-MFVF solution (Gerva?set al, 2008) and realizes using the case-basedapproach.?
NIL-UCM-EvoCBR.
Selects attributes us-ing the evolutionary solution and realizes us-ing the case-based approach.The results obtained by the three systems overdevelopment data are shown in Table 1.The evolutionary approach performs poorly butmight be improved by using a more refined al-gorithm for calculating attribute weights, such asdone in the last year NIL-UCM-MFVF solution.The reported CBR results were obtained overa case base built from a selection of the avail-able training data (samples that relied on datanot available in the input were omitted).
Thisapproach could be further refined by generatingstyle-specific subsets of the case base.AcknowledgmentsThis research is funded by the Spanish Ministry ofEducation and Science (TIN2006-14433-C02-01).ReferencesAamodt, A. and Plaza, E.. 1994.
