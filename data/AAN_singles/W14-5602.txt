?az de IlarrazaIXA NLP GroupUniversity of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)itziar.gonzalezd@ehu.esAbstractIn this paper we present Biografix, a pattern based tool that simplifies parenthetical structures withbiographical information, whose aim is to create simple, readable and accessible sentences.
Tothat end, we analysed the parenthetical structures that appear in the first paragraph of the BasqueWikipedia, and concentrated on biographies.
Although it has been designed and developed forBasque we adapted it and evaluated with other five languages.
We also perform an extrinsicevaluation with a question generation system to see if Biografix improve its results.1 Introduction and motivationParentheticals are expressions, somehow structurally independent, that integrated in a text function asmodifiers of phrases, sentences..., and add information or comments to the text.
Therefore, it has beenargued that they interrupt the prosodic flow, breaking the intonation.
According to Deh?e and Kavalova(2007), parentheticals can be realised in different ways: one-word parentheticals, sentence adverbials,comment clauses and reporting verbs, nominal apposition and non-restrictive relative clauses, questiontags, clauses and backtracking.
Besides, the authors argue that sometimes the parentheticals are notrelated to the host sentence neither semantically nor pragmatically, but they are understood in the textdue to the situational context.Some parentheticals can be the result of a stylistic choice (Blakemore, 2006) and that is the case of par-enthetical information found in the first paragraph of some Wikipedia articles.
As stated in the Wikipediaguidelines1the first paragraph of the articles should contain resuming and important information.
Thatis why the information is there so condensed.
Apart from condensing the information parentheticalscause long sentences, which are more difficult to process both for humans and for advanced applications.Moreover, web writting style books (Amatria et al., 2013) suggest not to use parenthetical constructs be-cause they make more difficult the access to the information.
Simple wikipedia guidelines2recommendalso not to use two sets of brackets next to each other.NLP applications such as question generation systems (QG) for educational domain3may fail whenfinding important information in brackets.
For example, if we want to create questions, systems suchas the presented in Aldabe et al.
(2013) will look for a verb4.
In the case of parenthetical biographicalinformation there is no verb which makes explicit when the person is born or when she or he died.
So,no question will be created based on that information.The study of parentheticals in Basque has been limited to the analysis of the irony in the narrativityof Koldo Mitxelena (Azpeitia, 2011).
In the present study we analyse the parentheticals that are usedin the first paragraph of the Basque Wikipedia and developed a rule-based tool Biografix to detect theseThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

http://www.questiongeneration.org/ (last accessed: April, 2014)4Both systems (one chunk-based and another dependency-based) presented in Aldabe et al.
(2013) follow the guidelinespresented in Rus and Graesser (2009).11structures and to create new sentences out of them.
To be more concrete, we concentrate on biographicalinformation since there are not explicit words in text that give a clue about what type of information it is.Our aim is to make more readable sentences and, consequently, to eliminate the interruption they cause.About the domain of biographies, their automatic generation has been studied (Duboue et al., 2003) inNatural Language Generation (NLG).
In this research line, referring expressions to people have beenstudied for automatic summarisation of news (Siddharthan et al., 2011).
The quality of the biographies(linguistic and content) has been recently analysed in the English Wikipedia (Flekova et al., 2014).We want also to make a first step towards the simplification of Basque Wikipedia, since English sim-ple wikipedia has been a great resource for Text Simplification (TS) and Readability Assessement (RA).Efforts for simple wikipedia have also been made for Portuguese (Junior et al., 2011) using TS tech-niques.
Although Biografix has been specially developed for Basque, being pattern-based, we have alsoevaluated its adaptation to other languages.
This work is not limited to wikipedia, Biografix can be usedon other types of text as well, since these structures can be found in educational texts, newspapers andso on.This paper is structured as follows: after this introduction we report in section 2 the treatment ofparentheticals in TS and in Wikipedia.
In section 3 we describe Biografix and in section 4 we report itsevaluation.
Finally, we conclude and outline the future work in section 5.2 Parenthetical StructuresIn this section we report the treatment that parenthentical structures have undergone in TS and other NLPapplications.
We also describe the parentheticals found in Basque Wikipedia.Parentheticals have been object of study in TS and three main operations have been proposed: a)parentheticals have been removed out of the texts (Drndarevi?c et al., 2013), b) parentheticals have beenremoved but they have been kept in another form (Aranzabe et al., 2012; Seretan, 2012) or c) paren-theticals have been added to explain the meaning by short paraphrases (Hallett and Hardcastle, 2008) orhyperonyms (Leroy et al., 2013).
In any case, it is usually recommended to avoid them (Alu?
?sio et al.,2008).
In other NLP applications such as summarisation they are usually removed and even some QGworks follow the same strategy, in case they are not relevant (Heilman and Smith, 2010).2.1 Parenthetical Structures in Basque WikipediaWikipedia guidelines emphasise the importance of the first paragraph.
It should indeed contain a sum-mary of the most significant information.
To concentrate all the information, stylistic resources such asparenthentical structures are used.
The information that is written in brackets in the Basque Wikipediacan be classified in two groups: a) information about people and b) information about concepts.
Aboutpeople biographical data and mandates are usually found and about concepts the etymology of words isfrequent.
Translations or transliterations of the named entity or the concept is found for both groups.On the other hand, there are other frequent parenthetical structures that are found in the first paragraph,but they are not written in brackets.
This is the case of the nicknames, which are written in commas.
Thiskind of information is also found in other languages.
After this analysis, we decided to concentrate onbiographical data to create new sentences out of that information.Biographical data Contrary to English Wikipedia, in Basque Wikipedia the information contained inbracket is, if known, birthplace (town, province, state), date of birth, and if the person is dead, date ofdeath and place of dead.
This is the case as well of the Catalan, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Germanand French Wikipedia among others, although sometimes paraphrases are found in brackets.
For Frenchthere is, for example, more than a way to write the biographical data5.In Basque Wikipedia guidelines6it is stated that biographical data should be written as in examples 1and 2.
If the person is dead, we see in example 1 that the birth data (town, state and date) and the deathdata (town, state and date) are linked by a dash.5http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conventions_de_style (last accessed: March, 2014)6http://eu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Artikuluen_formatua (last accessed: March, 2014)12(1) Ernest Rutherford, Nelsongo lehenengo baroia, (Brightwater, Zeelanda Berria, 1871ko abuztu-aren 30a - Cambridge, Ingalaterra, 1937ko urriaren 19a) fisika nuklearraren aita izan zen.
?Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, (Brightwater, New Zeeland, 30th August,1871 - Cambridge, England, 19th October, 1937) was the father of the nuclear Physics.
?And if the person is alive, only birth data (town, province, date) is provided as in example 2.
(2) Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola, nazioartean Karlos Argui?nano grafiaz ezagunagoa, (Beasain,Gipuzkoa, 1948ko irailaren 6a) sukaldari, aktore eta enpresaburu euskalduna da.
?Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola, internationally known with the Karlos Argui?nano spelling, (Beasain,Gipuzkoa, 6th September, 1948) is a basque chef, actor and businessman.
?In both cases, the places (if known) should precede the date and these should be separated by commas.However, biographical data is not frequently written uniformly.
Places do not precede the date, the dateis incomplete (only year) and sometimes other characters like the question mark appear to denote thatthe place or the date is known.Taking into account this guidelines and the articles we have analysed, we have developed Biografix, apattern based tool that detects biographical data and creates new sentences with this information.
Thistool was originally developed for Basque but it has been adapted to other languages.
An adaptationof this tool, moreover, could be used as a first step into Text Summarisation, if we only remove theparentheticals and do not create new sentences.Biographical information is contained in brackets in other Wikipedias as well but formats may bedifferent.
The way of writing, for example, in Catalan, German and Portuguese is similar to Basque.
InSpanish, French, and Italian that format is also used but, as mentioned beforehand, other formats are alsoaccepted.3 Inside BiografixBiografix is a pattern-based tool that simplifies the biographical data and creates new sentences out of thatinformation.
Having as an input the example 1 in subsection 2.1, Biografix will produce the sentences 3,4, 5, 6 and 7.
(3) Ernest Rutherford, Nelsongo lehenengo baroia, fisika nuklearraren aita izan zen.
?Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, was the father of the nuclear Physics.?
(4) Ernest Rutherford 1871ko abuztuaren 30ean Brightwateren jaio zen.
?Ernest Rutherford was born on the 30th of August, 1871 in Brightwater.?
(5) Brightwater Zeelanda Berrian dago.
?Brightwater is in New Zeeland.?
(6) Ernest Rutherford 1937ko urriaren 19an Cambridgen hil zen.
?Ernest Rutherford died on the 19th of October, 1937 in Cambridge.?
(7) Cambridge Ingalaterran dago.
?Cambridge is in England.
?So, if the person is dead, Biografix will write first the main sentence (3) followed by a new sentence (4)with the information about the birth.
If the birthplace is composed by more than a place entity, sentenceslike (5) will be written.
After the birth information, a sentence will contain the information about thedeath (6).
For the cases that more than a place appear, those will be rewritten (7).If the person is alive like in example 2 in subsection 2.1, the same process will take place, but no deathinformation will appear by creating the new sentences 8, 9 and 10.
(8) Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola, nazioartean Karlos Argui?nano grafiaz ezagunagoa, sukaldari, aktoreeta enpresaburu euskalduna da.
?Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola, internationally known with the Karlos Argui?nano spelling, is a basquechef, actor and businessman.
?13(9) Karlos Argi?nano 1948ko irailaren 6an Beasainen jaio zen.
?Karlos Argi?nano was born on the 6th of September, 1948 in Beasain.?
(10) Beasain Gipuzkoan dago.
?Beasain is in Gipuzkoa.
?So, first, main information will be kept (8) and then the information about the birth will appear (9).
Asa second place information (the province) original sentence (2), it will be rewritten as well (10).We have to mention that we use the title of the article as the subject of the sentences containing thebiographical information.
That is way we see that in sentences 9 and 10 the subject is Karlos Argi?nanoand the subject in sentence 8 is Karlos Argi?nano Urkiola.
We took this decision for cases where thereal name of person is not so known, e.g.
Cherilyn Sarkisian.
Had we used Cherilyn Sarkisian in all thesentences, would someone have known we are talking about Cher?To carry out these simplifying transformations Biografix follows the simplification process explainedin Aranzabe et al.
(2012):?
Splitting: In this stage we get the parts of the sentences we are going to work with.
To that end,three steps take place: a) the parenthetical structure is removed from the original sentence; b) thetype of parenthetical expression is checked looking at whether there are birth and death data or onlythe former; c) dates and places are split.
We use simple patterns to detect the dates and the places.As it is possible to find more than a place, they will be split by the commas.
This stage is commonfor all the languages.?
Reconstruction: The new simplified sentences are created in this stage.
This part is language-dependent, since we add the verbs, determinants, prepositions and case markers.
In the case ofBasque we also remove the absolutive case that is found in some articles7.
Anyway, we create threekind of sentences that are common for all the languages with the constructs obtained in the splittingstage: a) sentences indicating birth data, b) sentences indicating death data and c) sentences indicat-ing place specifications.
The main sentence will be kept as in the original version (the parentheticalhas been removed in the splitting stage).?
Reordering: The sentences will be ordered in text.
First, the main sentence; second, the informationabout the birth; if there is more than a place, the following sentences will contain that information(place specifications); third, the information about the death (if dead) and finally, the death placespecifications.?
Correction: The aim of this stage is to check if there are any mistake in the new sentences and tocorrect them.
As one of our goals is to know the correctness of Biografix?s output this stage has notbeen implemented yet.Biografix has been designed for Basque and then the reconstruction stage has been adapted to other 7languages: French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Italian and Portuguese.
To develop the Basqueversion we implemented the guidelines in Wikipedia (see subsection 2.1) and we used a small corpusof 50 sentences to find possible cases, where the guidelines are not fulfilled.
These 50 sentences wererandomly crawled.For other languages, we did not make any change in the splitting stage but for German.
Accordingto German Wikipedia guidelines birth and death data are separated by a semicolon and not by a dash.Although French, Spanish and Italian have other options to express the biographical information betweenbracket we did not implement them.
Our aim is not to create a tool specially for these languages, but tosee if the design for Basque can be applicable to other languages.
That is why, the adaptations to otherlanguages are available at our website8, if someone wants to improve them.7The absolutive case is used according to the format of the date.8https://ixa.si.ehu.es/Ixa/Produktuak/140353562914Other improvements could be done in the reconstruction stage.
To rewrite the sentences we have usedthe most familiar past tense in each language.
The only exception was French.
The most familiar pasttense according to the context is the pass?e compos?e but this tense requires the agreement of the genderbetween subject and verb9.
As the pass?e simple is not very familiar we decided to use the present tenseto avoid the concordance problem.
So, this could be one of the things to take into account for futuredevelopers.No other changes should be done in the reordering stage but the correction has to be adapted to eachlanguage.
No training was performed for the other languages.
Only 3-5 sentences were used to checkthat there were no errors.4 EvaluationIn order to evaluate Biografix we crawled the first sentence of 30 Wikipedia articles.
The method toselect these articles was the following: a) we used CatScan V2.0?10to get a list of the Biographies inBasque Wikipedia; b) we randomised that list and make another list to see which articles were writtenin 8 languages (Basque, Catalan, French, Galician, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish); c) weselected the first 32 articles.
The first two articles were used to explain and train the annotators.
The finaltest-sample had, therefore, 30 items.Having that sample, we performed two evaluations: a manual evaluation (section 4.1) and a extrinsicevaluation with a question generation system (section 4.2).4.1 Manual evaluationThe manual evaluation was carried out for 6 languages: Basque, Catalan, French, Galician, Germanand Spanish.
10 linguists took part in the evaluation process and they evaluated three aspects of thetask: the original sentences (JatTestua), Biografix performance (Prog) and the grammaticality of the newsimplified sentences (Gram).
In total they answered nine yes/no questions.
This evaluation method weare proposing is useful to perform an error analysis and find out which are the weak points of our tool.To evaluate the performance and the adaptation of Biografix we chose six languages according to theformat of the biographical data: i) Basque (the language Biografix has been designed for) ii) Catalan(same format as Basque), iii) German (same format but a slightly variation), iv) Spanish (same format asBasque but other options as well), v) French (same format as Basque in one of the parenthetical formatsand other options), vi) Galician (without defined format).
Portuguese and Italian were not evaluated be-cause their case studies were already evaluated with Catalan and Spanish.
All the sample were evaluatedby two annotators except for Catalan and Galician, because Catalan has the same case study as Basqueand Galician has not a predefined format that could cause confusion.Questions concerning the original sentences (JatTestua) Three questions were presented in regardsto the original sentence in Wikipedia.
The aim is to know if the original sentences do have parentheticalstructures and therefore, how many of them are candidates to simplification (coverage).1.
Are there parenthetical structures written between brackets?2.
Is the sentence grammatically correct and standard?3.
Is the punctuation correct?We asked about the grammaticality and the punctuation of original sentences (correctness) because itwas shown in Aldabe et al.
(2013) that many source sentences were incorrect and that fact decreased theperformance of the question generators and the correctness of the created questions.9e.g.
Cher est n?ee en Californie., but Ernest Rutherford est n?e?
en Angleterre.10http://tools.wmflabs.org/catscan2/catscan2.php (last accessed: March, 2014)15Questions concerning the performance of Biografix (Prog) Four questions were designed to check ifBiografix carries out the process it has been implemented for (precision).1.
Have parenthetical structures been removed?2.
Is all the information kept?3.
Taking into account the original sentence, is all the information correct?4.
Is there new information?Second and third questions are essential to know if at rewriting in the reconstruction stage no informa-tion has been omitted or changed.
The aim of the forth question is to know, for example, if sentences withother kind of information like translations have been added and treated as biographical or if a sentencereferring to the death of a living person has been created.Questions concerning the grammaticality of the new simplified sentences (Gram) Two questionswere prepared to check the correctness of the simplified questions, since to create correct sentences isvery important to understand the text.
These questions should be answered for each simplified sentence(grammatical precision).1.
Is the sentence grammatically correct and standard?2.
Is the punctuation correct?If these questions get negative results, we cannot forget that in our simplification study we consider thecorrection as a last step.
This way, the output of Biografix will be checked and, were there any mistakes,they would be corrected.4.1.1 Results of the manual evaluationIn table 1 we present the results obtained in the manual evaluation and it shows the results consideringthe following measures:1.
The coverage is the percentages out of 30 (the size of the sample) Biografix processed, that is, thesentences that had parentheticals.2.
The correctness is the percentage of the source sentences whose grammar and punctuation is correct.3.
The recall is the division between the number of the created simple sentences and the number of thesentences it should have created taking into account all the information in the original sentences.4.
The precision is the division between the correct performed, that is, all the Prog questions have beencorrectly answered and the processed sentences.
We call this precision at performance.5.
The grammatical precision is the correctly created sentences among the created sentences.In the second-last column we show the ?
agreement of the evaluators (Cohen, 1960).
As we have fewexamples, the expected agreement is very high and it causes low scores.
That is the reason why we alsoshow the percentage agreement (observed agreement) in the last column.Taking a look at the results for Basque, we see that Biografix is able to create almost all the sentences(recall: 0.94) and that they are correct (grammatical precision: 0.87), although there are little problemskeeping all the information and keeping it right (precision: 0.79).
Taking into account that the percentageof the correct source sentences is low (82.76), we follow Aldabe et al.
(2013) and recalculate the resultswithout the incorrect sentences.
This way, recall is 0.93, precision is 0.80, grammatical precision is0.88.
As we see, results do not vary that much, since the grammaticality of the source sentence hasonly influence in the first of the created sentences.
About the agreement between annotators, we see that?
is really low (0.37) due to the few disagreements that annotators had above all about the grammar.However, the observed agreement is high (90.63).16Language Coverage Correctness Recall Precision Gram.

Precision atperformance goes down (0.53) due to added and lost information but grammatical precision is acceptable(0.78).
We think, that this is a quite satisfactory adaptation.The results for French indicate that something went wrong.
There is more than a way to express thebiographical information and, as expected, the performance goes down.
The precision is very low (0.18)due to the fact that a lot of information is lost and as sometime paraphrases do appear in the originalsentence, this fact implies grammatical error.
Anyhow, the recall is acceptable (0.80) and that is a goodstarting point for the further development of French version.
The average of the obtained ?
measuresis really low (0.39) and that is why having few instances Cohen?s kappa penalises the disagreement toomuch.The case of Galician is quite different.
It is not stated in the guidelines how biographical data shouldbe written and the parentheticals we found are few (coverage: 43.00) and different from the Basque.However, we wanted to try Biografix and what we see is, that, although its precision at performance isreally low (0.15), the created sentences are quite correct (0.62).
We think the Galician Wikipedia shouldbe analysed thoroughly and then Biografix should be adjusted.The German version of Biografix was able to simplify all the sentences found in the test-sample andits recall is high (0.88).
Its weak point is the precision at performance (0.60), as in other languages, dueto the fact that the second question of Prog is not satisfied.
The sentence it creates are quite acceptable(0.71) as well.
Surprisingly, both linguists agreed in all the cases and questions.
So, we conclude thatthe German adaptation was successful.Finally, in the case of the Spanish adaptation, we see that the precision is very low (0.33) since therewas an important information loss.
However, the grammatical precision (0.67) is acceptable.
Although?
is higher (0.52) than in other languages, observed agreement is not far from Basque (88.76).
It isremarkable as well that being Spanish a long time normalised language only the 85.00 % of the sourcesentence are correct and that although there are other formats to express the biographical information thecoverage is absolute (100.00).The main disagreement was found when evaluating the grammar and the punctuation due to differentcriteria of the annotators.
For some of them sentences without verb were correct because they consideredthat there was an elided verb.
In our opinion, as we are trying to simplify, we think that all the sentencesshould have a finite verb.
Annotators did not have to much trouble to answer the four Prog questions,so we think that this is a good methodology, and, moreover, it makes easy to perform error analysis.
Wewant to point out that ?
has not been the best measure but we have used it as we consider that it is astandard to measure data reliability.To conclude, we find that there is room to improve the versions in other languages, above all trying notto lose information but the adaptation of Biografix has been a good starting point.
In fact, the adaptationhas been quite satisfactory for German and Catalan, because they share the format with Basque but theyshould be further analysed.
As foreseen, the languages with different formats like Galician, Spanish andFrench require a bigger analysis.174.2 Extrinsic evaluationTo evaluate the performance of Biografix throughout another NLP advanced application, we used the webapplication Seneko (Lopez-Gazpio and Maritxalar, 2013)11, the application of the chunk-based questiongeneration system for educational purposes presented in Aldabe et al.
(2013).
This kind of evaluationwas only performed for Basque.We ran Seneko with the original sentences and the simplified sentences.
The number of the generatedquestions is presented in table 2.
We break down the results on the basis of the case markers as well.In agglutinative languages like Basque case markers are the morphemes that express the grammaticalfunctions.Source file Total Absolutive Inessive Genitive OtherOriginal sentences 34 23 7 2 2Simplified sentences 142 65 66 8 3Table 2: Questions generated by Seneko using the original and the simplified sentencesUsing as input the original sentences Seneko is able to create 34 questions, more or less a questionper sentence.
23 of them have been generated for the absolutive case, that is, for the subject and thepredicative, and only 7 of them have been generated for the inessive.
Taking into account that we areworking with biographical information, this is a bad result because the inessive case in Basque is usedto express time and place relations.
That is, the inessive is used to create questions with the questionwords When and Where.
On the other hand, using as source the simplified sentences, 65 questions havebeen generated for the absolutive and 66 for the inessive.
This way, we see that using Biografix?s outputSeneko has been able to generate questions about place and time expressions.Next, in 11 and 12 we show an example of the questions generated by Seneko.
In 11 we find that usingthe original input it was only able to create a question, and it makes no sense but using the simplified text(example 12) Seneko creates two correct questions.

?This way, we conclude that Biografix is an useful tool to improve the performance of question gener-ation systems like Seneko.5 Conclusion and future workIn this paper we have presented Biografix, a tool that detects parenthetical structures and simplifiesthe biographical data in order to create new more readable sentences.
Although Biografix has been11http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/seneko/ (last accessed: March, 2014)18designed and developed for Basque, we have applied it to the parenthetical biographical informationwritten in other seven languages: French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Italian and Portuguese.The results of the evaluation show that the Basque version obtains very good results but the adaptationsshould be further developed.
Anyway, good results have been obtained for Catalan and German andpromising for Spanish and French.
Besides, we have shown its validity through an extrinsic evaluationwith Seneko, a question generation system.
These systems are important for the educational domain,and the improvement Biografix offers is considerable.
Although we have used Wikipedia to develop andevaluate Biografix, it can be used for other kind of text with parenthetical biographical information.For the future, we plan to continue analysing and implementing rules for other kind of parentheticalstructures like etymology, translations of named entities or mandates of relevant people.
We also planto link the entities to the their articles in Wikipedia to offer additional information.
Patterns could alsobe improved using previously developed analysers or tools, but this way the splitting stage will becomelanguage-dependent.
Moreover, we cannot forget that this work is included in the main framework ofthe TS system for Basque that we are developing and this is another step towards the main aim of gettingeasier and more readable Basque texts.AcknowledgementsItziar Gonzalez-Dios?s work is funded by a PhD grant from the Basque Government.
