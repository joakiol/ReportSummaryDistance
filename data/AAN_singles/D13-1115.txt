In thiswork, we improve a two-dimensional multi-modal version of Latent Dirichlet Allocation(Andrews et al 2009) in various ways.
(1) Weoutperform text-only models in two differentevaluations, and demonstrate that low-levelvisual features are directly compatible withthe existing model.
(2) We present a novelway to integrate visual features into the LDAmodel using unsupervised clusters of images.The clusters are directly interpretable and im-prove on our evaluation tasks.
(3) We providetwo novel ways to extend the bimodal mod-els to support three or more modalities.
Wefind that the three-, four-, and five-dimensionalmodels significantly outperform models usingonly one or two modalities, and that nontex-tual modalities each provide separate, disjointknowledge that cannot be forced into a shared,latent structure.1 IntroductionIn recent years, an increasing body of work has beendevoted to multimodal or ?grounded?
models of lan-guage where semantic representations of words areextended to include perceptual information.
The un-derlying hypothesis is that the meanings of wordsare explicitly tied to our perception and understand-ing of the world around us, and textual-informationalone is insufficient for a complete understanding oflanguage.The language grounding problem has come inmany different flavors with just as many different ap-proaches.
Some approaches apply semantic parsing,where words and sentences are mapped to logicalstructure meaning (Kate and Mooney, 2007).
Oth-ers provide automatic mappings of natural languageinstructions to executable actions, such as interpret-ing navigation directions (Chen and Mooney, 2011)or robot commands (Tellex et al 2011; Matuszek etal., 2012).
Some efforts have tackled tasks such asautomatic image caption generation (Feng and La-pata, 2010a; Ordonez et al 2011), text illustration(Joshi et al 2006), or automatic location identifica-tion of Twitter users (Eisenstein et al 2010; Wingand Baldridge, 2011; Roller et al 2012).Another line of research approaches groundedlanguage knowledge by augmenting distributionalapproaches of word meaning with perceptual infor-mation (Andrews et al 2009; Steyvers, 2010; Fengand Lapata, 2010b; Bruni et al 2011; Silberer andLapata, 2012; Johns and Jones, 2012; Bruni et al2012a; Bruni et al 2012b; Silberer et al 2013).Although these approaches have differed in modeldefinition, the general goal in this line of researchhas been to enhance word meaning with perceptualinformation in order to address one of the most com-mon criticisms of distributional semantics: that the?meaning of words is entirely given by other words?
(Bruni et al 2012b).In this paper, we explore various ways to integratenew perceptual information through novel computa-tional modeling of this grounded knowledge into amultimodal distributional model of word meaning.The model we rely on was originally developed by1146Andrews et al(2009) and is based on a general-ization of Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
This modelhas previously been shown to provide excellent per-formance on multiple tasks, including prediction ofassociation norms, word substitution errors, seman-tic inferences, and word similarity (Andrews et al2009; Silberer and Lapata, 2012).
While prior workhas used the model only with feature norms and vi-sual attributes, we show that low-level image fea-tures are directly compatible with the model andprovide improved representations of word meaning.We also show how simple, unsupervised clusters ofimages can act as a semantically useful and qualita-tively interesting set of features.
Finally, we describetwo ways to extend the model by incorporating threeor more modalities.
We find that each modality pro-vides useful but disjoint information for describingword meaning, and that a hybrid integration of mul-tiple modalities provides significant improvementsin the representations of word meaning.
We releaseboth our code and data to the community for futureresearch.12 Related WorkThe language grounding problem has received sig-nificant attention in recent years, owed in part to thewide availability of data sets (e.g.
Flickr, Von Ahn(2006)), computing power, improved computer vi-sion models (Oliva and Torralba, 2001; Lowe, 2004;Farhadi et al 2009; Parikh and Grauman, 2011)and neurological evidence of ties between the lan-guage, perceptual and motor systems in the brain(Pulvermu?ller et al 2005; Tettamanti et al 2005;Aziz-Zadeh et al 2006).Many approaches to multimodal research havesucceeded by abstracting away raw perceptual in-formation and using high-level representations in-stead.
Some works abstract perception via the us-age of symbolic logic representations (Chen et al2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011; Matuszek et al2012; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013), while otherschoose to employ concepts elicited from psycholin-guistic and cognition studies.
Within the latter cat-egory, the two most common representations havebeen association norms, where subjects are given a1http://stephenroller.com/research/emnlp13cue word and name the first (or several) associatedwords that come to mind (e.g., Nelson et al(2004)),and feature norms, where subjects are given a cueword and asked to describe typical properties of thecue concept (e.g., McRae et al(2005)).Griffiths et al(2007) helped pave the path forcognitive-linguistic multimodal research, showingthat Latent Dirichlet Allocation outperformed La-tent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al 1990) inthe prediction of association norms.
Andrews et al(2009) furthered this work by showing that a bi-modal topic model, consisting of both text and fea-ture norms, outperformed models using only onemodality on the prediction of association norms,word substitution errors, and semantic interferencetasks.
In a similar vein, Steyvers (2010) showed thata different feature-topic model improved predictionson a fill-in-the-blank task.
Johns and Jones (2012)take an entirely different approach by showing thatone can successfully infer held out feature normsfrom weighted mixtures based on textual similarity.Silberer and Lapata (2012) introduce a new methodof multimodal integration based on Canonical Cor-relation Analysis, and performs a systematic com-parison between their CCA-based model and otherson association norm prediction, held out feature pre-diction, and word similarity.As computer vision techniques have improvedover the past decade, other research has begun di-rectly using visual information in place of featurenorms.
The first work to do this with topic models isFeng and Lapata (2010b).
They use a Bag of VisualWords (BoVW) model (Lowe, 2004) to create a bi-modal vocabulary describing documents.
The topicmodel using the bimodal vocabulary outperforms apurely textual based model in word association andword similarity prediction.
Bruni et al(2012a) showhow a BoVW model may be easily combined witha distributional vector space model of language us-ing only vector concatenation.
Bruni et al(2012b)show that the contextual visual words (i.e.
the visualfeatures around an object, rather than of the objectitself) are even more useful at times, suggesting theplausibility of a sort of distributional hypothesis forimages.
More recently, Silberer et al(2013) showthat visual attribute classifiers, which have been im-mensely successful in object recognition (Farhadiet al 2009), act as excellent substitutes for feature1147norms.
Other work on modeling the meanings ofverbs using video recognition has also begun show-ing great promise (Mathe et al 2008; Regneri et al2013).The Computer Vision community has also bene-fited greatly from efforts to unify the two modalities.To name a few examples, Rohrbach et al(2010)and Socher et al(2013) show how semantic infor-mation from text can be used to improve zero-shotclassification (i.e., classifying never-before-seen ob-jects), and Motwani and Mooney (2012) show thatverb clusters can be used to improve activity recog-nition in videos.3 DataOur experiments use several existing and new datasets for each of our modalities.
We employ a largeweb corpus and a large set of association norms.
Wealso introduce two new overlapping data sets: a col-lection of feature norms and a collection of imagesfor a number of German nouns.3.1 Textual ModalityFor our Text modality, we use deWaC, a large Ger-man web corpus created by the WaCKy group (Ba-roni et al 2009) containing approximately 1.7Bword tokens.
We filtered the corpus by: removingwords with unprintable characters or encoding trou-bles; removing all stopwords; removing word typeswith a total frequency of less than 500; and remov-ing documents with a length shorter than 100.
Theresulting corpus has 1,038,883 documents consist-ing of 75,678 word types and 466M word tokens.3.2 Cognitive ModalitiesAssociation Norms (AN) is a collection of asso-ciation norms collected by Schulte im Walde et al(2012).
In association norm experiments, subjectsare presented with a cue word and asked to list thefirst few words that come to mind.
With enough sub-jects and responses, association norms can provide acommon and detailed view of the meaning compo-nents of cue words.
After removing responses givenonly once in the entire study, the data set containsa total of 95,214 cue-response pairs for 1,012 nounsand 5,716 response types.Feature Norms (FN) is our new collection of fea-ture norms for a group of 569 German nouns.
Wepresent subjects on Amazon Mechanical Turk witha cue noun and ask them to give between 4 and 8typical descriptive features of the noun.
Subjectsare given ten example responses; one such exam-ple is a cue of Tisch ?table?
and a response of hatBeine ?has legs?.
After collection, subjects whoare obvious spammers or did not follow instructionsare manually filtered.
Responses are manually cor-rected for spelling mistakes and semantically nor-malized.2 Finally, responses which are only givenonce in the study are removed.
The final data setcontains 11,714 cue-response pairs for 569 nounsand 2,589 response types.Note that the difference between associationnorms and feature norms is subtle, but important.
InAN collection, subjects simply name related wordsas fast as possible, while in FN collection, subjectsmust carefully describe the cue.3.3 Visual ModalitiesBilderNetle (?little ImageNet?
in Swabian German)is our new data set of German noun-to-ImageNetsynset mappings.
ImageNet is a large-scale andwidely used image database, built on top of Word-Net, which maps words into groups of images,called synsets (Deng et al 2009).
Multiple synsetsexist for each meaning of a word.
For example, Im-ageNet contains two different synsets for the wordmouse: one contains images of the animal, whilethe other contains images of the computer periph-eral.
This BilderNetle data set provides mappingsfrom German noun types to images of the nouns viaImageNet.Starting with a set of noun compounds and theirnominal constituents von der Heide and Borgwaldt(2009), five native German speakers and one nativeEnglish speaker (including the authors of this paper)work together to map German nouns to ImageNetsynsets.
With the assistance of a German-Englishdictionary, the participants annotate each word withall its possible meanings.
After discussing the an-notations with the German speakers, the Englishspeaker manually map the word meanings to synsetsenses in ImageNet.
Finally, the German speakersreview samples of the images for each word to en-2For brevity, we include the full details of the spammer iden-tification, cleansing process and normalization techniques in theSupplementary Materials.1148sure the pictures accurately reflect the original nounin question.
Not all words or meanings are mappedto ImageNet, as there are a number of words with-out entries in ImageNet, but the resulting data setcontains a considerable amount of polysemy.
The fi-nal data set contains 2022 word-synset mappings forjust 309 words.
All but three of these words overlapwith our data set of feature norms.
After extract-ing sections of images using bounding boxes whenavailable by ImageNet (and using the entire imagewhen bounding boxes are unavailable), the data setcontains 1,305,602 images.3.3.1 Image ProcessingAfter the collection of all the images, we extractedsimple, low-level computer vision features to use asmodalities in our experiments.First, we compute a simple Bag of Visual Words(BoVW) model for our images using SURF key-points (Bay et al 2008).
SURF is a methodfor selecting points-of-interest within an image.
Itis faster and more forgiving than the commonlyknown SIFT algorithm.
We compute SURF key-points for every image in our data set using Sim-pleCV3 and randomly sample 1% of the keypoints.The keypoints are clustered into 5,000 visual code-words (centroids) using k-means clustering (Sculley,2010), and images are then quantized over the 5,000codewords.
All images for a given word are summedtogether to provide an average representation for theword.
We refer to this representation as the SURFmodality.While this is a standard, basic BoVW model,each individual codeword on its own may not pro-vide a large degree of semantic information; typi-cally a BoVW representation acts predominantly asa feature space for a classifier, and objects can onlybe recognize using collections of codewords.
Totest that similar concepts should share similar vi-sual codewords, we cluster the BoVW representa-tions for all our images into 500 clusters with k-means clustering, and represent each word as mem-bership over the image clusters, forming the SURFClusters modality.
The number of clusters is chosenarbitrarily.
Ideally, each cluster should have a com-mon object or clear visual attribute, and words areexpress in terms of these visual commonalities.3http://simplecv.orgWe also compute GIST vectors (Oliva and Tor-ralba, 2001) for every image using LearGIST(Douze et al 2009).
Unlike SURF descriptors,GIST produces a single vector representation for animage.
The vector does not find points of interestin the image, but rather attempts to provide a rep-resentation for the overall ?gist?
of the whole im-age.
It is frequently used in tasks like scene iden-tification, and Deselaers and Ferrari (2011) showsthat distance in GIST space correlates well with se-mantic distance in WordNet.
After computing theGIST vectors, each textual word is represented asthe centroid GIST vector of all its images, formingthe GIST modality.Finally, as with the SURF features, we clusteredthe GIST representations for our images into 500clusters, and represented words as membership inthe clusters, forming the GIST Clusters modality.4 Model DefinitionOur experiments are based on the multimodal ex-tension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation developed byAndrews et al(2009).
Previously LDA has beensuccessfully used to infer unsupervised joint topicdistributions over words and feature norms together(Andrews et al 2009; Silberer and Lapata, 2012).It has also been shown to be useful in joint infer-ence of text with visual attributes obtained using vi-sual classifiers (Silberer et al 2013).
These mul-timodal LDA models (hereafter, mLDA) have beenshown to be qualitatively sensible and highly pre-dictive of several psycholinguistic tasks (Andrews etal., 2009).
However, prior work using mLDA is lim-ited to two modalities at a time.
In this section, wedescribe bimodal mLDA and define two methods forextending it to three or more modalities.4.1 Latent Dirichlet AllocationLatent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al 2003), orLDA, is an unsupervised Bayesian probabilisticmodel of text documents.
It assumes that all docu-ments are probabilistically generated from a sharedset ofK common topics, where each topic is a multi-nomial distribution over the vocabulary (notated as?
), and documents are modeled as mixtures of theseshared topics (notated as ?).
LDA assumes everydocument in the corpus is generated using the fol-1149lowing generative process:1.
A document-specific topic distribution, ?d ?Dir(?)
is drawn.2.
For the ith word in the document,(a) A topic assignment zi ?
?d is drawn,(b) and a word wi ?
?zi is drawn and ob-served.The task of Latent Dirichlet Allocation is then toautomatically infer the latent document distribution?d for each document d ?
D, and the topic distri-bution ?k for each of the k = {1, .
.
.
,K} topics,given the data.
The probability that the ith word ofdocument d isp(wi, ?d) =?kp(wi|?k)p(zi = k|?d).4.2 Multimodal LDAAndrews et al(2009) extend LDA to allow for theinference of document and topic distributions in amultimodal corpus.
In their model, a document con-sists of a set of (word, feature) pairs,4 rather than justwords, and documents are still modeled as mixturesof shared topics.
Topics consist of multinomial dis-tributions over words, ?k, but are extended to alsoinclude multinomial distributions over features, ?k.The generative process is amended to include thesefeature distributions:1.
A document-specific topic distribution, ?d ?Dir(?)
is drawn.2.
For the ith (word, feature) pair in the document,(a) A topic assignment zi ?
?d is drawn;(b) a word wi ?
?zi is drawn;(c) a feature fi ?
?zi is drawn;(d) the pair (wi, fi) is observed.The conditional probability of the ith pair (wi, fi)is updated appropriately:p(wi, fi, ?d) =?kp(wi|?k)p(fi|?k)p(zi = k|?d).The key aspect to notice is that the observedword wi and feature fi are conditionally indepen-dent given the topic selection, zi.
This powerful ex-tension allows for joint inference over both words4Here, and elsewhere, feature and f simply refer to a tokenfrom a nontextual modality and should not be confused with themachine learning sense of feature.and features, and topics become the key link be-tween the text and feature modalities.4.3 3D Multimodal LDAWe can easily extend the bimodal LDA model to in-corporate three or more modalities by simply per-forming inference over n-tuples instead of pairs, andstill mandating that each modality is conditionallyindependent given the topic.
We consider the ith tu-ple (wi, fi, f ?i , .
.
.)
in document d to have a condi-tional probability of:p(wi, fi, f?i , .
.
.
, ?d) =?kp(wi|?i)p(fi|?k)p(f?i |?
?i) ?
?
?
p(zi = k|?d)That is, we simply take the original mLDA modelof Andrews et al(2009) and generalize it in thesame way they generalize LDA.
At first glance, itseems that the inference task should become moredifficult as the number of modalities increases andobserved tuples become sparser, but the task remainsroughly the same difficulty, as all of the observedelements of a tuple are conditionally independentgiven the topic assignment zi.4.4 Hybrid Multimodal LDA3D Multimodal LDA assumes that all modalitiesshare the same latent topic structure, ?d.
It is pos-sible, however, that all modalities do not share somelatent structure, but the modalities can still combinein order to enhance word meaning.
The intuitionhere is that language usage is guided by all informa-tion gained in all modalities, but knowledge gainedfrom one modality may not always relate to anothermodality.
For example, the color red and the feature?is sweet?
both enhance our understanding of straw-berries.
However, one cannot see that strawberriesare sweet, so one should not correlate the color redwith the feature ?is sweet.
?To this end, we define Hybrid Multimodal LDA.In this setting, we perform separate, bimodal mLDAinference according to Section 4.2 for each of thedifferent modalities, and then concatenate the topicdistributions for the words.
In this way, HybridmLDA assumes that every modality shares some la-tent structure with the text in the corpus, but the la-tent structures are not shared between non-textualmodalities.1150For example, to generate a hybrid model for text,feature norms and SURF, we separately perform bi-modal mLDA for the text/feature norms modalitiesand the text/SURF modalities.
This provides us withtwo topic-word distributions: ?FNk,w and ?Sk?,w, andthe hybrid model is simply the concatenation of thetwo distributions,?FN&Sj,w ={?FNj,w 1 ?
j ?
KFN ,?Sj?KFN ,w KFN < j ?
KFN +KS ,where KFN indicates the number of topics for theFeature Norm modality, and likewise for KS .4.5 InferenceAnalytical inference of the posterior distribution ofmLDA is intractable, and must be approximated.Prior work using mLDA has used Gibbs Sampling toapproximate the posterior, but we found this methoddid not scale with larger values of K, especiallywhen applied to the relatively large deWaC corpus.To solve these scaling issues, we implement On-line Variational Bayesian Inference (Hoffman et al2010; Hoffman et al 2012) for our models.
InVariational Bayesian Inference (VBI), one approx-imates the true posterior using simpler distributionswith free variables.
The free variables are then op-timized in an EM-like algorithm to minimize differ-ence between the true and approximate posteriors.Online VBI differs from normal VBI by using ran-domly sampled minibatches in each EM step ratherthan the entire data set.
Online VBI easily scalesand quickly converges in all of our experiments.
Alisting of the inference algorithm may be found inthe Supplementary Materials and the source code isavailable as open source.5 Experimental Setup5.1 Generating Multimodal CorporaIn order to evaluate our algorithms, we first need togenerate multimodal corpora for each of our non-textual modalities.
We use the same method as An-drews et al(2009) for generating our multimodalcorpora: for each word token in the text corpus,a feature is selected stochastically from the word?sfeature distribution, creating a word-feature pair.Words without grounded features are all given thesame placeholder feature, also resulting in a word-feature pair.5 That is, for the feature norm modal-ity, we generate (word, feature norm) pairs; forthe SURF modality, we generate (word, codeword)pairs, etc.
The resulting stochastically generatedcorpus is used in its corresponding experiments.The 3D text-feature-association norm corpus isgenerated slightly differently: for each word inthe original text corpus, we check the existenceof multimodal features in either modality.
If aword had no features, it is represented as a triple(word, placeholderFN , placeholderAN ).
If theword had only feature norms, but no associations,it is generated as (word, feature, placeholderAN ),and similarly for association norms without featurenorms.
In the case of words with presence in bothmodalities, we generate two triples: (word, feature,placeholderAN ) and (word, placeholderFN , associ-ation).
This allows association norms and featurenorms to influence each other via the document mix-tures ?, but avoids falsely labeling explicit relation-ships between randomly selected feature norms andassociations.6 Other 3D corpora are generated usingthe same general procedure.5.2 EvaluationWe evaluate each of our models with two data sets: aset of compositionality ratings for a number of Ger-man noun-noun compounds, and the same associa-tion norm data set used as one of our training modal-ities in some settings.Compositionality Ratings is a data set of com-positionality ratings originally collected by von derHeide and Borgwaldt (2009).
The data set con-sists of 450 concrete, depictable German noun com-pounds along with compositionality ratings with re-gard to their constituents.
For each compound, 30native German speakers are asked to rate how re-lated the meaning of the compound is to each ofits constituents on a scale from 1 (highly opaque;entirely noncompositional) to 7 (highly transparent;very compositional).
The mean of the 30 judgments5Placeholder features must be hardcoded to have equal prob-ability over all topics to prevent all placeholder pairs from ag-gregating into a single topic.6We did try generating the random triples without placehold-ers, but the generated explicit relationships are overwhelminglydetrimental in the settings we attempted.1151is taken as the gold compositionality rating for eachof the compound-constituent pairs.
For example,Ahornblatt ?maple leaf?
is rated highly transparentwith respect to its constituents, Ahorn ?maple?
andBlatt ?leaf?, but Lo?wenzahn ?dandelion?
is rated non-compositional with respect to its constituents, Lo?we?lion?
and Zahn ?tooth?.We use a subset of the original data, compris-ing of all two-part noun-noun compounds and theirconstituents.
This data set consists of 488 com-positionality ratings (244 compound-head and 244compound-modifier ratings) for 571 words.
309 ofthe targets have images (the entire image data set);563 have feature norms; and all 571 of have associ-ation norms.In order to predict compositional-ity, for each compound-constituent pair(wcompound, wconstituent), we compute nega-tive symmetric KL divergence between the twowords?
topic distributions, where symmetric KLdivergence is defined assKL(w1||w2) = KL(w1||w2) +KL(w2||w1),and KL divergence is defined asKL(w1||w2) =?kln(p(t = k|w1)p(t = k|w2))p(t = k|w1).The values of ?sKL for all compound-constituent word pairs are correlated with the humanjudgments of compositionality using Spearman?s ?,a rank-order correlation coefficient.
Note that, sinceKL divergence is a measure of dissimilarity, weuse negative symmetric KL divergence so that our?
correlation coefficient is positive.
For exam-ple, we compute both ?sKL(Ahornblatt, Ahorn)and ?sKL(Ahornblatt, Blatt), and so on for all488 compound-constituent pairs, and then correlatethese values with the human judgments.Additionally, we also evaluate using the Associa-tion Norms data set described in Section 3.
Sinceit is not sensible to evaluate association norm pre-diction when they are also used as training data,we omit this evaluation for this modality.
Follow-ing Andrews et al(2009), we measure associationnorm prediction as an average of percentile ranks.For all possible pairs of words in our vocabulary,we compute the negative symmetric KL divergencebetween the two words.
We then compute the per-centile ranks of similarity for each word pair, e.g.,?cat?
is more similar to ?dog?
than 97.3% of therest of the vocabulary.
We report the weighted meanpercentile ranks for all cue-association pairs, i.e.,if a cue-association is given more than once, it iscounted more than once.5.3 Model Selection and HyperparameterOptimizationIn all settings, we fix all Dirichlet priors at 0.1, usea learning rate 0.7, and use minibatch sizes of 1024documents.
We do not optimize these hyperparame-ters or vary them over time.
The high Dirichlet pri-ors are chosen to prevent sparsity in topic distribu-tions, while the other parameters are selected as thebest from Hoffman et al(2010).In order to optimize the number of topics K, werun five trials of each modality for 2000 iterationsfor K = {50, 100, 150, 200, 250} (a total of 25runs per setup).
We select the value or K for eachmodel which minimizes the average perplexity esti-mate over the five trials.6 Results6.1 Predicting Compositionality RatingsTable 1 shows our results for each of our selectedmodels with our compositionality evaluation.
The2D models employing feature norms and associa-tion norms do significantly better than the text-onlymodel (two-tailed t-test).
This result is consistentwith other works using this model with these fea-tures (Andrews et al 2009; Silberer and Lapata,2012).We also see that the SURF visual words are ableto provide notable, albeit not significant, improve-ments over the text-only modality.
This confirmsthat the low-level BoVW features do carry semanticinformation, and are useful to consider individually.The GIST vectors, on the other hand, perform al-most exactly the same as the text-only model.
Thesefeatures, which are usually more useful for compar-ing overall image likeness than object likeness, donot individually contain semantic information usefulfor compositionality prediction.The performance of the visual modalities reverseswhen we look at our cluster-based models.

The clusters based on GIST, on the other hand,provide a minor improvement in compositionalityprediction.All of our 3D models are better than the text-onlymodel, but they show a performance drop relativeto one or both of their comparable bimodal models.The model combining text, feature norms, and as-sociation norms is especially surprising: despite theexcellent performance of each of the bimodal mod-els, the 3D model performs significantly worse thaneither of its components (p < .05).
This indicatesthat these modalities provide new insight into wordmeaning, but cannot be forced into the same latentstructure.The hybrid models show massive performance in-Modality K Assoc.Text OnlyText Only (LDA) 200 .679Bimodal mLDAText + Feature Norms 150 .676Text + SURF 50 .789 ***Text + GIST 100 .739 ***Text + SURF Clusters 200 .618 ***Text + GIST Clusters 150 .6903D mLDAText + FN + SURF 100 .722 ***Text + FN + GC 200 .601 ***Hybrid mLDAFN, SURF 150+50 .800 ***FN, GC 150+150 .742 ***FN, GC, SURF 150+150+50 .804 ***Table 2: Average predicted rank similarity between cuewords and their associates.

Furthermore, improvements gen-erally continue to grow significantly with each addi-tional modality we incorporate into the hybrid model(p < .001 for all but the .404 to .406 compari-son, which is not significant).
Clearly, there is agreat deal to learn from combining three, four andeven five modalities, but the modalities are learn-ing disjoint knowledge which cannot be forced intoa shared, latent structure.6.2 Predicting Association NormsTable 2 shows the average weighted predicted ranksimilarity between all cue words and associates andtrials.
Here we see that feature norms do not seem tobe improving performance on the association norms.This is slightly unexpected, but consistent with theresult that feature norms seem to provide helpful, butdisjoint semantic information as association norms.1153We see that the image modalities are much moreuseful than they are in compositionality prediction.The SURF modality does extremely well in partic-ular, but the GIST features also provide statisticallysignificant improvements over the text-only model.Since the SURF and GIST image features tend tocapture object-likeness and scene-likeness respec-tively, it is possible that words which share asso-ciates are likely related through common settingsand objects that appear with them.
This seems toprovide additional evidence of Bruni et al(2012b)?ssuggestion that something like a distributional hy-pothesis of images is plausible.Once again, the clusters of images using SURFcauses a dramatic drop in performance.
Combinedwith the evidence from the compositionality assess-ment, this shows that the SURF clusters are activelyconfusing the models and not providing semantic in-formation.
GIST clusters, on the other hand, are pro-viding a marginal improvement over the text-onlymodel, but the result is not significant.
We take aqualitative look into the GIST clusters in the nextsection.Once again, we see that the 3D models are inef-fective compared to their bimodal components, butthe hybrid models provide at least as much informa-tion as their components.
The Feature Norms andGIST Clusters hybrid model significantly improvesover both components.7 The final four-modality hy-brid significantly outperforms all comparable mod-els.
As with the compositionality evaluation, weconclude that the image and and feature norm mod-els are providing disjoint semantic information thatcannot be forced into a shared latent structure, butstill augment each other when combined.7 Qualitative Analysis of Image ClustersIn all research connecting word meaning with per-ceptual information, it is desirable that the inferredrepresentations be directly interpretable.
One niceproperty of the cluster-based modalities is that wemay represent each cluster as its prototypical im-ages, and examine whether the prototypes are re-lated to the topics.We chose to limit our analysis to the GIST clus-7The gain is smaller than compared to SURF Hybrid, butthere is much less variance in the trials.ters for two primary reasons: first, the SURF clustersdid not perform well in our evaluations, and sec-ond, preliminary investigation into the SURF clus-ters show that the majority of SURF clusters arenearly identical.
This indicates our SURF clustersare likely hindered by poor initialization or param-eter selection, and may partially explain their poorperformance in evaluations.We select our single best Text + GIST Clusterstrial from the Compositionality evaluation and lookat the topic distributions for words and image clus-ters.
For each topic, we select the three clusters withthe highest weight for the topic, p(c|?k).
We extractthe five images closest to the cluster centroids, andselect two topics whose prototypical images are themost interesting and informative.
Figure 1 showsthese selected topics.The first example topic contains almost exclu-sively water-related terms.
The first image, extractedfrom the most probable cluster, does not at first seemrelated to water.
Upon further inspection, we findthat many of the water-related pictures are scenicviews of lakes and mountains, often containing acloudy sky.
It seems that the GIST cluster doesnot tend to group images of water, but rather naturescenes that may contain water.
This relationship ismore obvious in the second picture, especially whenone considers the water itself contains reflections ofthe trees and mountain.The second topic contains time-related terms.
The?@card@?
term is a special token for all non-zeroand non-one numbers.
The second word, ?Uhr?, ispolysemous: it can mean clock, an object which tellsthe time, or o?clock, as in We meet at 2 o?clock (?Wirtreffen uns um 2 Uhr.?)
The three prototypical pic-tures are not pictures of clocks, but round, detailedobjects similar to clocks.
We see GIST has a prefer-ence toward clustering images based on the predom-inant shape of the image.
Here we see the clustersof GIST images are not providing a definite seman-tic relationship, but an overwhelming visual one.8 ConclusionsIn this paper, we evaluated the role of low-level im-age features, SURF and GIST, for their compatibil-ity with the multimodal Latent Dirichlet Allocationmodel of Andrews et al(2009).

The second shows clock-like objects, but not clocks.ture sets were directly compatible with multimodalLDA and provided significant gains in their ability topredict association norms over traditional text-onlyLDA.
SURF features also provided significant gainsover text-only LDA in predicting the compositional-ity of noun compounds.We also showed that words may be representedin terms of membership of image clusters based onthe low-level image features.
Image clusters basedon GIST features were qualitatively interesting, andwere able to give improvements over the text-onlymodel.Finally, we showed two methods for extendingmultimodal LDA to three or more modalities: thefirst as a 3D model with a shared latent structurebetween all modalities, and the second where latentstructures were inferred separately for each modal-ity and joined together into a hybrid model.
Al-though the 3D model was unable to compete withits bimodal components, we found the hybrid modelconsistently improved performance over its compo-nent modalities.
We conclude that the combinationof many modalities provides the best representationof word meaning, and that each nontextual modal-ity is discovering disjoint information about wordmeaning that cannot be forced into a global latentstructure.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the UT Natural Lan-guage Learning Reading Group and the anonymousEMNLP reviewers for their most helpful commentsand suggestions.
