It; is our aim to extract theregularities that are implicitly contained in thedata.
Two corpora were used tbr this study,r(~l)resenting the Norl;hern Dul, eh and Sout;hernDutch w~rbmts.
D)r Northenl Dut(:h Celex (re-leas(; 2) was used and for Flemish Fonilex (ver-sioll 1.01)).
The Celex datM)ase contains fie-quen(:y infi)rlnation (based on the INL corl)uS ofthe hlsl;itute fi)r 1)ul;(:h Lexieology), and i)hono-logi(:al~ morl)hologicM , and synt;a(:tic lexicM in-tbrmation tbr more l;tmn 384.000 word forms,327and uses DISC as encoding tbr word pronuncia-tion.
The Fonilex database is a list of more than200.000 word tbrms together with their Flemishpronunciation.
For each word tbrm, an abstractlexical representation is given, together withthe concrete pronunciation of that word tbrmin three speech styles: highly formal st)eech,sloppy speech and "normal" speech (which isan intermediate l vel).
A set of phonologicalrewrite rules was used to deduce these concretespeech styles ti'om the abstract t)honologicaltbrm.
The initial phonological transcription wasobtained by a grapheme-to-phoneme converterand was afterwards corrected by hand.
Fonilexuses YAPA as encoding scheme.
By means oftheir identification umber, the Fonilex entriesalso contain a rethrence to the Celex entries,since Celex served as basis tbr the list of wordtbrms in Fonilex.
E.g.
tbr the word "aaitje"(Eng.
: "stroke"), the relevant Celex entry is"25/aait.je/5/'aj-tj?
}/" and the correspondingFonilex entry looks like "251aaitjel'ajts@l".
Theword tbrms in Celex with a fl'equency of 1 andhigher (indicated in field 3) ~re included inFonilex and fl:om the list with tiequency 0, onlythe monomorphematic words were selected.In the fi)llowing section, a brief explanationis given of the method we used to search forthe overlap and ditfhrences between both re-gional w~riants of Dutch.
Section 3 providesa quantitative analysis of the results.
Section4 discusses the dittbrences between Celex andFonilex, starting fl'om tile set of transtbrmationrules that is learned during Transtbrmation-Based Error-Driven Learning (TBEDL).
Theserules are COlnpared to the production rules pro-duced by C5.0.
In addition, we present anoverview of the non-systematic diflhrences.
Ina final section, some concluding remarks aregiven.
"2 Ru le  Induct ionOur starting i)oild; is the assumption that thedifferences in the phonemic transcriptions be-tween Flemish and Dutch are highly systematic,and can be represented in a set of rules.
Hence,these rules provide linguistic insight into theoverlap and discrepancies between both w~ri-ants.
Moreover, they can be used to adapt pro-mmciation databases tbr Dutch md;omaticallyto Flemish and vice versa.
A possil)le w~y tofind the regul~trities within the diflbrences be-tweet, both corpora is to make the rules byhand, which is time-consmning and error-prone.Another option is to make use of a data-orientedlearning method in which linguistic knowledgeis learned automatically.
In our experiment wehave made use of two rule induction techniques,viz.
~:a~nsformation-Based Error Driven Learn-ing (TBEDL) (Brill, 1995) and C5.0 (Quinlan,1993).In the process of 'Transfbnnation-BasedError-Driven Learning, transtbrmation rules arelearned by comparing a corpus that is annotatedby an initial state annotator to a correctly amlo-tared corpus, which is called the "truth".
l)ur-ing that comparison, an ordered list of trans-tbrmation rules is learned.
This ordering im-plies that the application of an earlier ule some-times makes it possible tbr a later rule to apply(so-called "feeding").
In other cases, as alsodescrit)ed in the work of Roche and Schabes(1995), a given structure fiTdls to undergo a ruleas a consequence of s()me earlier rule ("bleed-ing").
These rules are applied to tile output ofthe initial state ammtator ill order to t)ring thatoutt)ut closer to the "truth".
A rule consists oftwo parts: a transtbrmation and a "triggeringenvironment".
For each iteration in the learningprocess, it is investigated tbr each possible rulehow many mistakes can be corrected throughal)t)lication of that rule.
The rule which causesthe greatest error reduction is retained.Figure 1 shows the TBEDL learning processapt)lied to the comparison of the Celex repre-sentation and the Fonilex "n()rmal" representa-|;ion, which flmctions as "truth".
In this case,the task is to learn how to transtbrm Celex rel)-resentations into Fonilex representations (i.e.,translate Dutch pronunciation to Flemish pro-mmciation).
Both corpora serve as input tbrthe "transtbrmation rule learner" (Brill, 1995).This learning process results in an ordered list oftransformation rules which reflects the system-atic differences between both representations.A rule is read as: "change x (Celex representa-tion) into y (Fonilex representation) in the fol-lowing triggering enviromnent".E.g.

With .Transformation-BasedError-Driven Learning and C5.0, we lookedfor the systematic differences between NorthernDutch and Flenfish.In TBEDL, the complete training set of 90%was used for learning the transfbrmation rules.A threshold of 15 errors was specified, whichmeans that learning stops if the error reduc-tion lies under that threshold.
Due to the largeamount of training data, this threshold was cho-sen to reduce training time.
This resulted inabout 450 rules.
In figure 2, the number oftransformation rules is plotted against the ac-curacy of the conversion between both w, riants.100 .....959O85~ 80~ 757O656O550 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450number ot' transformation rulesFigure 2: Descrii)tion of the accuracy of theword and phoneme level in relation to thennmber of transtbrmation rules.Figure 2 shows that especially tile first 50rules lead to a considerable increase of perfor-mance fl'om 59.07% to 79A0% on the word leveland from 92.77% to 96.98% for phonemes, whichindicates the high applicability of these rules.Afterwards, the increase of accuracy is moregraduah from 79.40% to 88.95% (words) andfl'om 96.98% to 98.52% (phonemes).For the C5.0 experiment~ 50% (887.647 cases)of the original training set served as training set(more training data was not feasible).
A deci-sion tree model and a production rule modelwere lmilt from the training cases.
The treegave rise to 745 rules.
These production ruleswere applied to the original 10% test set we nsedin the TBEDL experiment.
In order to makethe type of task comparable for the transfbr-marion based approach used by TBEDL, andthe classification-based approach used in C5.0,the output class to be predicted by C5.0 waseither ~0' when the Celex and Fonilex phonemeare identical (i.e.
no change), or the Fonilexphoneme when Celex and Fonilex differ.Table 2 gives an overview of the overlapbetween Celex and Fonilex after application oft)oth rule induction techniques.
A comparisonof these results shows that, when evaluatingboth TBEDL and C5.0 on the test set, the ruleslearned by the Brill-tagger have a higher errorrate, even when C5.0 is only trained on half thedata used by TBEDL.
On tile word level, theinitial overlap of 59.07% is raised to 88.95% a fter application of the 450 transformation rules,and to 90.35% when using the C5.0 rules.
Onthe phoneme level, the initial 92.77% overlapis increased to 98.52% (TBEDL) and 98.74%(C5.0).
C5.0 also has a slightly lower error ratefor the consonants, vowels and diphthongs.~_ I Word Phon.

It is indeed possible to reli-ably 'translate' Dutch into Flenfish.4 Qualitative Ana lys i sIn this section, we are concerned with the lin-guistic quality of tile rules that were extractedusing TBEDL and C5.0.
To gain more insightill the important differences between both pro-nunciation variants, a qualitative analysis of tilerules was performed.
Therefore, the conver-sion rules were listed and compared.
The fol-lowing list presents some examples for conso-nants, vowels and diphthongs.
Starting point330is the first 10 rules that were learned duringTBEDL, which are compared with the 10 C5.0rules, which most reduce the error rate.
In the,transtbrmation rules 1)resented below, the rela-tionship between Dutch art(1 Flemish, especiallythe most important differences, are extractedfronl the eorl)ora and tbrmulated in a set of eas-ily understmldal)le rules.
The C5.0 produ(:tionrules, Oll the other hand also descrit/e the over-lapl)ing phonelnes between Celex and Dmilex,which makes it hard to have at clear overview ofthe regularities in the dilt'erences 1)etween bothvariants of Dutch.
The fact that the category'0' was used to describe the overlap betweenthe databases (no chauge) does not; really hell).Even if C5.0 discovers that no change is thedefault rifle, additional specific rules (lescrit)ingthe, default condition are neverthel(~ss ne('c, ssaryto l)revent he other rules fl'om tiring incorrectly.4.1 ConsonantsNearly 60% of the differences on the conso-nant level concerns l;he alternation 1)etweenvoiced and unvoiced consonants.

This alternation also isthe subject of the first transformation rule,namely " /x/  changes into/ ,g/  it, case of a wordt)eginning (indicated by "STAAll.T") one ortwo I)ositions t)efbre".
When looking at theto t) ten of the C5.0 l)roduction rules that mostreduce error rate, the two most important rulesalso describe this alternation:i lnle 682: (7749/29, lift 110.9)t-1 in {=,  {, c:}f in {x, .q, ;, Q}1-> class y \[0.996\]Rule 683: (7749/29, lift 110.91f l  in {=, {, ~:}f in {x, ,q}-> class ,g \[0.996\]Another important phenomenon is the useof p~tlatalisation i  Flemish, as in the word"aaitje" (Eng.

Linguistic literature, such as the workof Booij (1995) and De Schutter (1978) in-dicates tendencies uch as voicing and devoic-ing on the consonant level and the confllsion oftense and lax vowels as important differencesbetween Northern Dutch and Flemish.
Thesame discrepancies are f(mnd in the transcrip-tions made by both Flemish and Dutch sub-jects in the Dutch transcription experiments de-scribed in Gillis (19!
)9).5 Error  Ana lys i sBesides tile systematic phonenlic differences be-tween Flemish and Dutch, there are a num-ber of mmystematic differences between bothdatabases.
After application of 450 transfor-mation rules, 88.95% of the words makes a cor-rect; transition from the Celex-transcription tothe Fonilex-transcriptiolL The 7d5 C5.0 ruleslead to a 90.35%.
Using the Brill-tagger, it alsohas to be taken into account that rules can  beundone by a later rule (see also Roche and Sch-abes (1995)), as in tile word "feuilleteer" (Bug.
:"leaf througlf').
Celex provides the transcrit)-tion/t'(x'.y.iol;e:r/, while Fonilex transcribes it as/f~:jate:r/.
During learning, the transtbrmationrule "change /my/  into /~:/ if the precedinggraphenm is an <e>" is learned.
This resultsin the correct Fonilex-/ff~:jote:r/.
This trans-formation, however, is canceled by a later rule,which changes /0:/ back into /oey/ if tile *bl-lowing grapheme is an <i>.
This leads againto the original Celex-transcription.
C5.0, whichdoes not suflhr from sinfilar consequences of ruleordering, will correctly classify "feuilleteer".hi this section, we are concerned with therelnaining errors after application of all rules.Making use of a rule induction technique to ex-tract the sub-regularities in the differences be-tween the corpora can lead to some rules, which,however, may be based on noise or errors inthe databases.
Theretbre, a manual analysiswas done, which showed that the explanationof these remaining errors is twotbhl.A first reason is that no rule is awfilable tbrless frequent cases.
TILe rules are induced onthe basis of a sufficiently big frequency effect.This leads to no rule at all tbr less frequent1)honemes and phoneme coml)inations mid alsofor phonemes which are not always consistentlytranscribed.
Examples are loan words, such as"points" and "pantys '~ or the loan sound / - /which only appears in Fonilex.Another cause tbr errors is that rules willovergeneralise in certain cases.
The confusion332matrix for vowels in table 5 clearly indicatesthe tendency to use more l~x vowels in Flem-ish.
This leads to a mmfl)er of tr;mstbrInationrules ~md C5.0 rules describing this tendency.
A(:loser investigation of the errors committed t)ythe, Brill-tagger, however, shows thnt 41..7% ofthe errors concerns the use of a wrong vowel.
In25% of the errors conmfitted on the t)honemelevel, there was an incorrect transition fl'om atense to a b~x vowel, as in '%ntagonislne" (Eng.

Studying the accuracy of 1)othsystems, we noted that M'ter ~l)plication of thetranstbrmation rules that were learned t)y theTBEDL method, 73% of the differences (m theword level and 80% of the ditl'crences on thet)honeme level was covered by the rules.

The results of the transtbrnlation-based le~rnillg approach are clearly more un-derstandMfle than those of a classification-basedlenrning approach for this problem.ReferencesG.
