Using the PARADISE evaluation paradigm, we show that performance models derived using standard metrics can account for 68% of the variance of User Satisfaction.
We discuss the implication of these results and how the evaluation paradigm may be modified for the military domain.1 Introduction Operation Iraqi Freedom has demonstrated the need for improved communication, intelligence, and information capturing by groups of dis-mounted warfighters (soldiers and Marines) at the company level and below.
Current methods of col-lecting intelligence are cumbersome, inefficient and can endanger the safety of the collector.
For example, a dismounted warfighter who is collect-ing intelligence may stop to take down notes, in-cluding his location and time of report or alternatively try to retain the information in mem-ory.
This information then has to be typed into a report on return to base.
The authors have devel-oped a unique, hands-free solution by capturing intelligence through spoken language understand-ing technology called WIRE or Wearable Intelli-gent Reporting Environment.
Through WIRE, users simply speak what they see, WIRE under-stands the speech and automatically populates areport.
The report format we have adopted is a SALUTE report which stands for the information fields: Size, Activity, Location, Unit, Time and Equipment.
The military user is used to giving in-formation in a structure way, therefore, informa-tion entry is structured but the vocabulary is reasonably varied, an example report is ?Size is three insurgents, Activity is transporting weapons.?
These reports are tagged by WIRE with GPS posi-tion and time of filing.
The report can be sent in real-time over 802.11 or radio link or downloaded on return to base and viewed on a C2 Interface.
WIRE will allow for increased amounts of digit-ized intelligence that can be correlated in space and time to predict adverse events.
In addition, pre and post-patrol briefings will be more efficient, accu-rate and complete.
Additionally, if reports are transmitted in real time, they have the potential to improve situational awareness in the field.
This paper discusses the challenges of taking spoken language understanding technology out of the laboratory and into the hands of dismounted warfighters.
We also discuss usability tests and results from an initial test with Army Reservists.
2 System Overview WIRE is a spoken language understanding system that has a plug-and-play architecture (Figure 1) that allows for easy technology refresh of the dif-ferent components.
These components pass events to each other via an event bus.
The speech is col-lected by an audio server and passed to the Auto-matic Speech Recognizer (ASR) server, which is responsible for converting the audio waveform into an N-best list.
The Natural Language (NL) under84Figure 1.
WIRE System Architecture  standing component executes a named-entity tag-ger to tag and retain key text elements within the each candidate N-best list element.
The sets of tagged entities are then parsed using a bottom-up chart parser.
The chart parser validates each named entity tag sequence and generates a syntactic parse tree.
A heuristic is then applied to select the best parse tree from the N-best list as the representative spoken text.
After a parse tree is selected, a seman-tic parser is used to prune the parse tree and pro-duce a semantic frame?a data structure that represents the user's spoken text.
The semantic frame is then passed through a rule-based filter that translates text as necessary for processing, e.g., converting text numbers to digits.
The semantic frame is then passed to the Dia-logue Manager which decides what action to take based on the most recent utterance and its context.
If the system is to speak a reply, the natural lan-guage generation component generates a string of text that is spoken by the Text-To-Speech engine (TTS).
The WIRE spoken language understanding sys-tem was fully developed by the authors with the exception of the ASR, called Dynaspeak?, which was developed by SRI International (Franco et al, 2002) and the TTS engine from Loquendo S.p.A. Grammars for the ASR and NL have to be written for each new domain and report type.
In order for the system to adapt to the user?s en-vironment, there are two modes of operation.
In-teractive mode explicitly confirms what the user says and allows the user to ask the system to read back certain fields or the whole report.
Alterna-tively, in stealth mode, the user simply speaks the report and WIRE files it immediately.
In bothcases, audio is recorded as a back-up for report accuracy.
3 Challenges of Deployment to Dis-mounted Warfighters The goal of WIRE is to provide a means of report-ing using an interface that is conceptually easy to use through natural language.
This is particularly challenging given the fluid nature of war and the constant emergence of new concepts such as dif-ferent types of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) or groups of insurgents.
Another challenge is that each unit has its own idiosyncrasies, call signs and manner of speaking.
Because WIRE is a limited-domain system and it is not possible to in-corporate all of this variability, we found training to be a key factor in user and system performance and acceptance.
A new challenge that phone-based or desk-top systems have yet to face is the need for a mobile spoken language understanding system that can be worn by the user.
From a software perspective, WIRE has to have a small footprint.
From a hard-ware perspective, the system has to be lightweight, robust, and rugged and must integrate with existing equipment.
Wearable computing is constantly evolving and eventually WIRE will be able to run on a system as small as a button.
We have also been working with various companies to create a USB noise-canceling microphone similar to what the military user is accustomed to.
4 Experiment Design  Fifteen Army Reservists and three former Marines participated in WIRE usability tests in a laboratory environment.
The Reservists predominately pro-vide drill-instructor support for Army basic train-ing groups.
The session began with a brief introduction to the WIRE system.
Following that, participants reviewed a series of self-paced training slides.
They then completed two sets of four sce-narios, with one set completed in stealth mode and the other in interactive mode.
A total of 523 utter-ances were collected.
Participants were asked to complete five-question surveys at the end of each set of scenarios.
For the regression model de-scribed below, we averaged User Satisfaction scores for both types of interaction modes.85We adopted the PARADISE evaluation method (Walker et al, 1997).
PARADISE is a ?decision-theoretic framework to specify the relative con-tribution of various factors to a system?s overall performance.?
Figure 2 shows the PARADISE model which defines system performance as a weighted function of task-based success measures and dialogue-based cost measures.
Dialogue costs are further divided into dialogue efficiency meas-ures and qualitative measures.
Weights are calcu-lated by correlating User Satisfaction with performance.Figure 2.
PARADISE Model (Walker et al, 1997)   The set of metrics that were collected are:   ?
Dialogue Efficiency Measures: User Turns, Average Length of Utterance, Average Re-sponse Latency and Platform.
?
Dialogue Quality Measures: Word Accuracy.
?
Task Success Measures: Report Accuracy, Field Correctness for Size, Activity, Location, Unit, Time and Equipment.
?
User Satisfaction: Average of User Ex-pertise, User Confidence, System Trust, Task Ease, Future Use.
User Satisfaction is the average of responses from a survey of five questions on a five-point Likert scale with five being the highest rating.
These questions in-clude:  ?
Q1: I knew what I could say at any point (User Expertise).
?
Q2: I knew what I was doing at any point in the dialog (User Confidence).
?
Q3: I trusted that WIRE accurately cap-tured my report information (System Trust).
?
Q4: I felt like I could create and file a re-port quickly (Task Ease).?
Q5: I would recommend that this system be fielded (Future Use).
These questions are modified from the more tra-ditional User Satisfaction questions (Walker et al, 2001) that include TTS Performance and Expected Behavior.
TTS Performance was substituted be-cause the voice is of such a high quality that it sounds just like a human; therefore, the question is no longer relevant.
Expected Behavior was substi-tuted for this study because WIRE is mostly user initiative for the reporting domain.
The Task Success metric was captured by Re-port Accuracy.
This was calculated by averaging the correctness of each field over the number of fields attempted.
Field correctness was scored manually as either 1 or 0, depending on whether the report field was filled out completely correctly based on user?s intent.
Partial credit was not given.
Various platforms were used in the experiment, including laptops, tablet PCs and wearable com-puters.
The Platform metric reflects the processing power with 0 being the highest processing power and 1 the less powerful wearable computers.
5 Experimental Results We applied the PARADISE model using the met-rics described above by performing multiple linear regression using a backward coefficient selection method that iteratively removes coefficients that do not help prediction.
The best model takes into ac-count 68% of the variance of User Satisfaction (p=.01).
Table 1 gives the metrics in the model with their coefficients and p values.
Note that the data set is quite small (N=18, df=17), which most likely affected the results.
Table 1.
Predictive Power and Significance of Metrics Metric Standardized ?
Coefficients p value User Turns -0.633 0.01 Unit Field Correctness 0.735 0.00 Platform -0.24 0.141  Results show an average User Satisfaction of 3.9 that is broken down into 4.09 for interactive mode and 3.73 for stealth.
The lowest medium user satis-faction score was for System Trust (3.5), the high-est for Task Ease (4.5).86Speech recognition word accuracy is 79%, how-ever, Report Accuracy, which is after the speech has been processed by the NL, is 84%.
Individual field correctness scores varied from 93% for Activ-ity to 75% for Location.
From previous tests, we have found that word accuracy increases through user training and experience up to 95%.
6  Interpretation and Discussion These initial results show that the User Turns met-ric is negatively predictive of User Satisfaction.
This is intuitive as the more user turns it takes to complete a report the less satisfied the user.
(Walker et al, 2001) have similar findings for the Communicator data where Task Duration is nega-tively predictive of User Satisfaction in their model (coefficient -0.15).
Secondly, Unit Field Correctness is predictive of User Satisfaction.
Given this model and the limited data set, this metric may represent task completion better than overall Report Accuracy.
During the test, the user can visually see the report before it is sent.
If there are mistakes then this too will affect User Satisfaction.
This is similar to findings by (Walker et al, 2001) who found that Task Comple-tion was positively predictive of User Satisfaction (coefficient 0.45).
Finally, Platform is negatively predictive, in other words: the higher the processing power (scored 0) the higher the User Satisfaction and the lower the processing power (scored 1) the lower the User Satisfaction.
Not surprisingly, users prefer the system when it runs on a faster computer.
This means that the success of the system is likely de-pendent on an advanced wearable computer.
There have been recent advances in this field since this experiment.
These systems are now available with faster Intel processors and acceptable form factor and battery life.
The User Satisfaction results show that areas of improvement include increasing the trust in the user (Q3).
This challenge has been discussed pre-viously for military applications in  (Miksch et al, 2004) and may reflect tentativeness of military personnel to accept new technology.
Trust in the system can be improved by putting the system in ?interactive?
mode, which explicitly confirms each utterance and allows the user to have the system read back the report before sending it.
A Wilcoxon signed-rank test (Z = 2.12, p < .05) indicated thatscores for this question were significantly higher for interactive mode (M = 3.93) than stealth mode (M=3.27).
Our current evaluation model uses User Satis-faction as a response variable in line with previous PARADISE evaluations (Walker et al, 2001).
However, User Satisfaction may not be the most appropriate metric for military applications.
Unlike commercial applications, the goal of a military sys-tem is not to please the user but rather to complete a mission in a highly effective and safe manner.
Therefore, a metric such as mission effectiveness may be more appropriate.
Similarly, (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006) use the domain-specific re-sponse variable, of student learning in their evalua-tion model.
An obvious extension to this study is to test in more realistic environments where the users may be experiencing stress in noisy environments.
Ini-tial studies have been performed whereby users are physically exerted.
These studies did not show a degradation in performance.
In addition, initial tests outside in noisy and windy environments em-phasize the need for a high quality noise canceling microphone.
Further, more extensive tests of this type are needed.
In summary, we have presented the WIRE spo-ken language understanding system for intelligence reporting, and we have discussed initial evalua-tions using the PARADISE methods.
Through ad-vances in spoken language understanding, hardware and microphones, this technology will soon transition out of the laboratory and into the field to benefit warfighters and improve security in conflict regions.
