The system combines speech rec-ognition, machine translation, and cross-lingual information retrieval components toenable real-time alerting from live Englishand Arabic news sources.12Real-time Video AlertingThis paper describes the Enhanced Video Text and Au-dio Processing (eViTAP) system, which provides fully-automated real-time broadcast news video and audioprocessing.
The system combines state-of-the-artautomatic speech recognition and machine translationcomponents with cross-lingual information retrieval inorder to enable searching of multilingual video newssources by a monolingual speaker.
In addition to fullsearch capabilities, the system also enables real-timealerting, such that a user can be notified as soon as aword, phrase, or topic of interest appears in an Englishor Arabic news broadcast.The key component of the news processing is theVirage VideoLogger video indexer software package(Virage 2003).
The VideoLogger processes an incom-ing live satellite feed, encodes the video as a digital file,and manages the video and audio processing compo-nents.
The individual components integrated into theVideoLogger platform currently include the audio proc-essing and machine translation systems described inSection 2, as well as face ID, broadcaster logo ID, andscene change analysis.The video and audio processing components pro-duce textual metadata that is time-stamped to enablesynchronization with the encoded video file.
All data isindexed and stored for retrieval by a cross-lingual in-formation retrieval engine.
Figure 1 shows the EViTAPcross-lingual search and alerting interface, with real datafrom the system.
The list of relevant video clips match-ing an alerting profile or a user search is shown on theleft, with broadcast source and time, most-frequentnamed entities, and a relevancy score.
Note that theEnglish query ?bin laden?
resulted in the display ofrelevant stories in both English and Arabic.
The centerof the screen contains the video playback window, withclip navigation and keyframe storyboard.
The right ofthe interface contains the transcripts from the ASR andMT engines; video playback is synchronized with thetranscripts such that words are highlighted as they arespoken in the video.Real-time Spoken Language ProcessingThe real-time audio processing in the eViTAP system isperformed by the BBN AudioIndexer system, describedin detail in (Makhoul et al 2000).
The AudioIndexersystem provides a wide range of real-time audio proc-essing components, including automatic speech recogni-tion, speaker segmentation and identification, topicclassification, and named entity detection.
All audioprocessing is carried out on a high-end PC (dual 2.6GHz Xeon CPU, 2 GB RAM).
The real-time speechrecognition system produces a word error rate ofroughly 20-30% for English and Arabic news sources.Figure 1: Multilingual alerting and search interface, with alert list, synchronized video playback, Arabic speechrecognition output, Arabic-to-English  machine translation output.The Arabic words produced by the speechrecognition system, including all ASR errors,  areprocessed by an Arabic-to-English machine translationsystem that also operates in real time (on a separatehigh-end PC).
The eViTAP system currently processesArabic sources using statistical machine translationsystems from IBM (Al-Onaizan 2003) and LanguageWeaver (Benjamin et al 2003).AcknowledgementsThis work was partially supported by the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency and monitored bySPAWAR under contract NBCHD030007.ReferencesY.
