MERGING - THE ART OF REPRESENTING DIFFERENT LEVELS OYSENTENCE STRUCTURE IN A SINGLE ANALYSIS TREE.Frank VanEyndeDepartement Linguistlek, Blljde Inkomststraat, 21B - 3000 Leuven, Belgium!~ An unproblemat ic  exampleThe f i r s t  example i l l us t ra tes  the merging of a part  ofspeech ana lys i s  with a funct iona l  ana lys i s ,l t l  t Part  of speech ana lys i s  and the on l ine  pr inc ip leA par t  of speech ana lys i s  cons is ts  in  the assignmentof category labe ls  to lex ica i  un i t s .
By adding pars ing  ru lesto the categor ia l  ana lys i s  one could a lso car ry  out the nexts tep o f@roup ing  those lex ica l  un i t s  in to  la rger  synta~at icunits,The principle governing the part of speech analysis isthe on llne principle:, syntagmatic units are analysed fromthe left to the right without changing the word order~?

\]lt2t Funct iona l  ana lEs ie  and the dependency pr inc ip lefunctional analysis consists in the assignment offunction labels to synta~natlc units.The principle governing the functional analysis is thedependency principle: every syntaEmatic unit (~ sentence)- 95  -contains one and only one lexical unit functioning as itshe ad ?Example: ( I" )SUJ G0V I0 DOGOVI promised J | IHarry me a GOV carInewThe sister nodes of each GOV-node areeither terminal nodes, in which case there is no functionlabel specified?
cf.
the node of the indefinite artic-le.or non-terminal nodes, in which case the function labeltakes one of the following values: SUJ, DO, IO, ~F(= modifier), ...The function labels specify the kind of relat ion holding bet-ween the head and its dependents?
Por instance, "Harry" is thesubject of "promised", "new" is a modif ier of "oar", etc.1,3, A synthetic representationAssumption: the part of speech analysis and the functionalanalysis can be represented in the same tree, sin-ce the on llne principle and the dependency prin-ciple are compatible.

In other words, where do ~e have to attachthe S-node of the result clause?Pot reasons (to be given in the full version of thispaper) we propose the following dependence structure for (2):(2")SUJ GOV MPGOV left ~IP GOV on Tuesdayl / '~- Lhe GOV J N~ earlyso that we missed him- 97 -2.3.
A synthetic representation2.3.1.
Unfortunately, the part of speech analysis andthe functional analysis do not match (cf.
the disturbance ofthe word order in (2").A marging of the labeled bracketing with the dependencystructure would give the following result:(II) r~,-~\]@ R o ~ , ~  EA,GOVJ on Tuesday tiat.., himhe ~A,GOg \[-,MFJ earlyl soThe lowest MF-node dominates no lexlcal material, and has,consequently, no category label.
The righmost S-node, on theother hand, has no functional label, since it does not bearany dependency relation to the verb.Important to note is the fact that both deficient nodesare complementary, and that they in fact refer to each other.In order to make thls relation explicit, I propose to add anindex (an arbitrary integer) to both nodes:(II) ,.. ~-,MPJ1 .. .~S,-~iThanks to this coindexlng device we are able to merge two le-vels of sentence structure, although they do not seem to becompatible at first sight.2.3.2.
The computation of (II) can be performed in astraightforward way:.
