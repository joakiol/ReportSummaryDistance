A notion of space, which we basi-cally have, plays an important part in the fac-ulty of thinking and speech.
In this paper, weconcentrate on a particular class of spatial de-scriptions, namely descriptions about positionalrelations on a two-dimensional space.
A theo-retical device we present in this paper is calledthe potential model The potential model pro-vides a means for accumulating from fragmen-tary information.
It is possible to derive max-imally plausible interpretation from a chunk ofinformation accumulated in the model.
Whennew information is given, the potential modelis modefied so that that new information istaken into account.
As a result, the interpre-tations with maximal plausibility may change.A program called SPRINT(SPatial Relation IN-Terpreter) reflecting our theory is in the way ofconstruction.i IntroductionNatural language description is vague in manyways.
The real world described with naturallanguage has continuous expanse and transi-tion, although the natural anguage itself is adescrete symbolic system.
Vagueness plays animportant role in our communication i thatit allows us to transfer partial information.Suppose a situation in which a boy is lookingaround for his toy.
Even if we cannot tell ex-764actly where it was if we know it was somewherearound my desk~ we can transfer him this par~tim information by telling that his toy is aroundmy desk.
It would be nice if we can communiocute with our robot in the same way.
We alsouse vague expression in the case of thinking ituseless to give more detailed information to th6hearer.A theoretical device we present in this pa-per for the interpretation of such wague infor-mation is called potential model.
The potemtial model employs both continuous and clis~continuous functions to represent spatial rela-tions, so that the probability changes eithercontinuously or discontinously, depending onthe nature of a given description.
Currently, weare concentrating on a particular class of spa-tial relations, namely positional relations on atwo-dimensional space, although the potentialmodel is more general.
We assume objects tobe sizeless.A program called SPRINT (SPatial RelationINTerpreter) reflecting our theory is in the wayof construction.2 The Potential  ModelAt the center of potential model is a potentialfunction, which gives a value indicating the costfor accepting the relation to hold ainong a givenset of arguments.
The lower is the value pro-vided by a potential function, the more plausi-ble is the corresponding relation.
We allow thevalue of potential functions to range from 0 topotent ia lt race  o f  g radua l  approx imat ionXFigure 1: Potential Model and Gradual Ap-proximation+co.
A potential function may give a minimalvalue for more than one combination of argu-ments.
S~dt case may be taken as an existenceof ambiguity.A primitive potential function is defined foreach spatial relation.
A potential function foroverall situation is constructed by adding prim-itive potential functions for spatial relations in-volved.When a potential function is formulated froma given set of information, the system will seekiora combination of arguments which may min-hnize the value of potential function.
We usea gTadual approximation method to obtain anapproximate solution.
Starting from an appro-priate combination of arguments, the systemchanges the current set of values by a smallamount proportional to a virtual force obtainedby differentiating the potential function.
Thisprocess will be repeated until the magnitude ofvirtual fo:cce becomes less than a certain thresh-old.
Figure 1 illustrates those idea.Unfortunately, using the gradual approxima-tion ,nay not find a combination which makesa given potential function minimum.
Whenthere are some locally minimal solutions, thismethod will terminate with a combination ap-propriately near one of them.
Which nfinimalnohtion is chosen depends on the initial setof argmnents.
We assume there exists someheuristic which predicts a suttldently good i,fi-tim values and the above approximation processworks rather as an adjustment than as a meansfor finding solution.1 / ~/ X=Xe KL'/ t~,,  /?
Y,,- ( m, y,BFigure 2: Distance Potential2.1 The Spring ModelWe use an imaginary, virtual mechanical springbetween constrained objects to represent con-straint on distance.
If the distance between thetwo objects is equal to the natural ength of thespring, the relative position is most plausible.The more extended or compressed the spring,the more (virtual) force is required to maintainthe position, corresponding to the interpreta-tion being less plausible.An integration of the force needed either toextend or compress the spring is called an elas-tic potential.
TILe spring model, subclass of thepotential model, takes an elastic potential as apotential function.
Let the positions of two ob-jects connected by a spring of natural ength Land elastic constant It" be (x0, y0) and (xl,yl),respectively.
Then the potential is given by thefollowing formula:P(xo, Yo, xx, Y*) = I ( (v~l :  x?
)2 + (y' -- y?
)2 - L)~2See figure 2 for the shape of this function.2.2 Inhibited Region and Inhib-ited Half PlaneUnlike other primitive potential functions in-troduced so far, inhibited region and half planepose a discontinuous constraint on the possibleregion of position.
By inhibited region and halfplane we mean a certain region and half planeis inhibited for an object to enter,.respectively.Inhibited regions and half planes are not globalin the sense that each is defined only for someparticular object.
Inhibited region is less ba-sic concept because it can be represented by alogical combination of inhibited half plane.765I(x=, y,)j 0Figure 3: Directional PotentialAn inhibited half-plane is chaxacterized byitsdirected boundary line.
A directed boundaryline in turn is characterized by the orientation0 (measured counter-clockwise from the orien-tation of x-axis) and a location (X, Y) of a point(referred to as a characteristic point) on it.
Theinhibited half plane is the right hand side of thedirected boundaa'y.2.3 Directional PotentialSuppose we want to represent a constraint thatan object B is to the direction 0 of another ob-ject A (measured counter-clockwise).
Let theposition of A and B be (x0, y0) and (Xl, yl), re-spectively.
We use the following potential func-tion to represent the constraint:P(xo, Yo, xl,y,) .-'.
I'\[1(-(xl - xo) sin 0 + (Yl - Yo) cos ~) 2 + 1(2When viewed horizontally from A, this func-tion represents a hyperbola.
If this functionis cut vertically to the intended irection, thisrepresent a parabola (upside down).
See figure3 for the shape of this function.
Note that thenotion of direction defined here denotes that ineveryday life, which is not very rigid.Since the value of the potential function de-fined above P jumps from +oo to -co  if oneproceeds for the -0  direction.We add inhibited half planes in the - 0 direc-tion, so that it is impossible to put the objectin this region.7663 A Method o f  Gradua lApprox imat ionA maximally plausible position is obtained byrevising a tentative solution repeatedly.The move/~ = (Ax, A~) at each step is givenas follows:?
~ = (Az ,  A~)  = K .
(OP\]Ox,  OP/Oy)~where K is a positive constant.This basic move may be complicated by taldl~ginhibited regions into account.
The followingsubsection explain how it is done.3.1 Avoiding to Place Ob-jects within its Inhib i ted HaftPlaneAn algoritlu~n ior escaping from inhibited haltplane is applied when an object is placed withinits inhibited half plane.
If such a situation isdetected, the algoritl~un defined below will pushthe object out of an inhibited half plane in nsteps.
At this time, any influences from otherconstraints axe taken into account.
Thus, themove d = (d~, dr) of the object at each step isthe sum of dr) I = (dv~,dv , )  (a component verotical to the boundary) and d~o = (dp.,dp,)  (acomponent in par,'flld to the boundary).
Sup?pose the initial position of an object is (x0, y0),then each of which is defined as follows:dv~ = -L  sin 0Indv~ = L cos 0/uwhere, L : I(xo- Y)~in 0 .
(~0 - Y)cos 01 represents the distance from the initial position tothe boundary of the inhibited half plane?
Notethat the inhibited half plane is characterizedby its directed boundary with a characteristicpoint (X ,  Y) and the orientation 0.dvo = V(I~ co~ 20 + 1~ sh 0 cos 0)up, = c(1: sin o cos o + 1~ sin ~o)where, C is a positive co.rant, and / = (f., \] ,)is a virtual force from other constraints.

Analgorithm for avoiding to push objects into itwatches out for such situation.
If it detects, itwill recourse the gradual move.Suppose an inhibited half plane is character-ized by 0 and (X, Y) on the boundary.
Sup-pose aho that the next position suggested bythe gradual approximation algorithm is (x, y).~fL = x,,;inO- ycosO-  XsinO + YcosO > 0then, the next position will be forced into theh ddbited half plane; In, such a case, the moveis x aoditled and the new destination becomes:(:d, y') =: (x - (1 + e)LsinO, y + (1 + e)Lcos O)where, e is a positive infinitesimal.See figure 5.302 DependencyIt would require a great amount of comput&.tion, if the position of all objects have to be de-ter~fined at once.
Fortunately, human-humancommmtication is not so nasty as this is thecase; natural anguage sentences contain manycues which help the hearer understand the in-pttt.
~br example, in normal conversations, theutter~uceKyoto University is to the north ofKyoto Stationis given in the context in which the speaker hasalready given the position of Kyoto Station, ors/he can safely assume the hearer knows thatfact.
If such a cue is carefully recognized, theamount of computation must be significantlyreduced.Dependency is one such cue.
By dependencywe mean a partial order according to whichposition of objects are determined.
SPRINT isdesigned so that it can take advantage of it.Instead of computing everything at once, thespatial reasoner can determine the position ofobjects one by one.
An object whose positiondoes not depend on any other objects is cho-sen as the origin of local coordinate.
SPRINTdetermines the temporary position of objectsfrom the root of the dependency network.
Theposition of an object will be determined if theposition of all of its predecessors is determined.-Figure 6 shows how SPRINT does this.This algorithm has three problems:1. the total plausibility may no~ be maximal.2.
in the worst case, the above may result incontradiction.3.
objects may be underconstrained.Currently, we compromise with the first prob-lem.
More adequate solution may be to havean adjustment stage after initial contlgnlationof objects are obtained.
The second problemwill be addressed in the next subsection.
Thethird remains as a future problem.3.3 Resolving ContradictionAdding new information may result in incon-sistency.

Suppose an ob-ject is given a maximally plausible position x0.Suppose also that a new inhibited region (inter-val I in a one dimensional world) is given as anew constraint.
Then the position of the objectis recomputed so as to take this new constraintinto account.
If the interval I accidentally in-volves x0, then the object may be moved out ofinterval I.
This is the situation in which the ob-ject  tends to move to the position x0 but cannotdue to the inhibited half space.
In this case, theparent node in the dependency is tried to movein the reverse direction to resolve this situation.A situation is worse than the above ff the in-hibited region (or interval) is too wide to fit ina space.
This problem rises especially when we768take size into account.
Suppose the position oftwo objects A and B are already given maxi-mally plausible positions x0 and x l (xo  < x l ) ,respectively.
Suppose now the third object Cwith width being wider than Xl -x0  is declaredto exist between A and B.
This causes a failurebecause there is no space to place C.The solution to this problem comprises in twostages.
First, the reason of the failure is ana-lyzed.
Then, parents of the current objects aremoved gradually so that the inconsistency canbe removed.
Figure 7 illustrates how this works.4 Re lated WorkThe problem of vagueness has not been stud-ied widely in spatial reasoning\[Kui78,Lav77,+~++ !i7?+W~:(++~:+ij.
