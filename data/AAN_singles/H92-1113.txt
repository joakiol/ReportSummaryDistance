Wilks, Principal InvestigatorComputing Research LaboratoryNew Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico 88003PROJECT GOALSThe Computing Research Laboratory (CRL) at NewMexico State University, jointly with the Center forMachine Translation (CMT) at Carnegie Mellon Uni-versity and the Information Sciences Institute (ISI)at the University of Southern California, are develop-ing a Translator's Workstation to assist a user in thetranslation of newspaper articles in the area of finance(mergers and acquisitions) in one language (Spanish ini-tially) into a second language (English).
At its coreis a multilingual, knowledge-based, interlingual, interac-tive, machine-assisted translation system consisting of asource language analysis component, an interactive aug-mentor, and a target language generation component.In the initial phase, the CRL's objectives are to developtools for constructing lexical items and ontological en-tries automatically from on-line resources, to developthe initial Spanish analysis component, and, jointly withCMT and ISI, to establish the infrastructure for thethree site project, develop the formats and initial contentof the interlingua, the ontology, and the knowledge base,and to prepare design documents for the second phaseversions of the analysis and generation components, theaugmentor, and the translator's workstation.With respect o developing tools for extracting informa-tion from on-line resources, during the first year we arefocusing on providing general classificatory informationfor use in constructing the lexicons of the Spanish anal-ysis and English generation components.
Here we arebuilding on work on automatically constructing interlin-gual word sense specifications from Longman's which weare extending and adapting to language particular lexi-cal entries.
With respect o the Spanish analysis compo-nent, the objective is to modify and extend the Spanishcomponent of the CRL's multilingual machine transla-tion system both in terms of coverage and robustness.RECENT RESULTSAt this point, the three sites have established the centralinfrastructure for the Pangloss project.
For the first yearsystem, the formats of the interlingua, the ontology, andthe knowledge base have been set and initial design ofthe interlingua for the second phase version is underway.As a preliminary to the work on extracting informationfrom on-line resources, we continue to gather esources inthe form of monolingual and bilingual dictionaries andmonolingual and bilingual corpora.
We have obtainedCollins English Dictionary, Collins Bilingual Spanish-English Dictionary and are looking into a Spanish mono-lingual dictionary and Japanese monolingual and bilin-gual dictionaries.
We have identified a source for Span-ish texts in the financial domain and are seeking furthersources as well as sources of Japanese texts.The central resource to date, however, is the LongmanDictionary of Contemporary English and the informa-tion being extracted relates to word formation, syntacticcategory, syntactic subcategorization, and semantic se-lection restrictions.
Procedures are currently being de-veloped to provide this information in a form that canbe used directly by the generation component and indi-rectly by the analysis component.The effort to develop the Spanish component has primar-ily focussed on the analysis of sample Spanish newspaperarticles in the financial domain in order to identify, first,the lexical items and constructions that are currently be-yond the scope of the system, and, secondly, the typesof "ill-formedness" which we are likely to face.
Workon modifying and extending the core system began inDecember along with the development of procedures fordiagnosing "ill-formedness" in the input string prior toanalysis and for relaxing constraints during processing.PLANS FOR THE COMING YEARIn the coming year, our intention is to produce a proto-type workbench for testing and evaluation in September.That will be follow by the extension of the prototype to asecond source language (Japanese).
In addition, greateramounts of automation will be introduced into each ofthe components of the MAT system and into the pro-cess of constructing lexical items and ontological entries.Lastly, in phase 2 we will be introducing pragmatics intothe analysis and generation components.480
