'l'\]m re.la:\[ions are associated with constrailg;S on the semanticrelationships between tile proposit, iomd contents of twoclauses, t,heir Modality and Tense/Asl>eet.1 In t roduct ionThe lthetorieal Strucl;ure The(,ry (lIST) by Mann andThompson \[Manu and Thoml)SOn , 1.<)87\] is a t;hcoryof int,er-s<ml,eni,ial (or inter:clausal) )'elationships in atext.
All;hough RS'\[' is int;ended to serve both as aframework for taxi, analysis and l,ext generation, it hasso flu' been used exclusiw~ly in |;exl, generation \[Hovyet al, 1992} \[Linden et al, 1(,)92\] [Ri;sner and Stede,i992\].
Several resea.rehers ecognise that RST has de-%ors as an analyti<:al frame.work.
Moore and Pollack\[Moore and Pollack, 19921, for example, claim that theassmul)tion of a single relation bel.ween discourse el-CIIICtL|,S is Olle <)\[" I,he reasons why lIST analyses areinherently ambiguous.
They also claim that the under:s\[)ecilieil,y of the rhel;orieal relal,ion delinil,ions causesproblems,Our elaim is thai, the main cause ()17 I,he di\[liculties ofapplying l iST t;o t;exl; i)rocessing systems is that SOlileof the relat;ions are delined on the basis of l;he elfeetswhich they have OIL a reader, This is particularly thecase for the relations classitied as prcseulatioual rcla-lion.s, the relal;ions whose intended etfects are to in-crease some inclination in a reader.I),ackgrotmd relatiolh for examph;, is defined as arelation whose Satellite increases the al)ility of a readertO (;()lLll)reh(~lld all elelnelll, in Nucleus and the readerwill not tully comprehend Nucleus before reading thet,ext; of Satellite, This delinition is problematic becausethere are many ways of increasing the ability of a readerto comprehend Nucleus.
More seriously, \[,he delinition*Supporte.d by Old Elcctri(: Industry Co., btd.itself does not predict anything about textual forlus ofNucleus and Satellite.In order to use RST in actual text processing sys-tems, we have to break down st<('.h detinitions to re-late them with I,extual forms.
In this paper, we showhow the defitfitions can be broken down and be ass()-eiated wil;h semaul;ic onsl;raints betweell eonstituelg,S(clauses), in order t,o relate them with constraints onsurface linguisl,ic forms.
Among tile 24 rhetorical rela-tions detined in \[Mann and Thompson, 1987\], we focuson presentational relations (7 relations are elassilied assuch) which are the most prol)lematic.
The re.suits ofal)plying our met;hod t<) leading ari;icles in a aal)anescnewspal)er are also discussed.2 Bas ic  F rameworkIn RST, 24 relations are divided into two groups: pre-s<ntational relations and subject matter rchdious.
Ac-cording to Mmm and Thomps(m \[Malta and Thomp-son, 1987\], subject matter relations are those whoseintended effect is that the reader recogldses the rela-l;ion in question and presentational relations are thosewhose intended eft'cot is to increase some inclinationin the reader.
Moore and Pollack \[Moore and Pollack,1992\] eotllllletll, i;hai; subject matter relations are infofmational and l)resentat,ional relations are intentional.Table 1 shows what kind of inclination each presen-tational relation is inI;ended to increase.
One can seethat tile detinitions are highly abstract and have not,h-ing to do with the surface realisations of the relations.On the other hand, it has been observed that thereare wu:ious surface cues in texts which are useful\[or ideld;ifying inl;er-senl, enl;ia\[ (or inter-clausal) units.Ilalliday and llasan \[llalli(lay and llasan, 1985\] iden-titled a set of linguistic devices for linking one part ofa text 1,o another, such as reJcrcnce, subslihtlion andellipsis, conjuncliou, and \[exical cohesion.From the view point of text processing, these linguis-t, it devices can be used as cues tor segment.ing a textinto structural units (Satellite and Nucleus).
However,these cues hardly give any clue about which clause ofa unit is Satellite, which clause is Nucleus, and which1177Table 1: RSrelationBackground1,hiablementMotivationl,;videneeJustifyAntithesisCol leess io l trelations and their iuclination typeldnd of inclinationability of R to comprehend an elementpotential ability to perlbrm action iuNdesire to perforln action in NbelieJ' of Nreadiness to accept writer's right in Npositive regard for situation presentedin Npositive regard tbr situation presentedin NRS relation combines the two clauses into a single unit.For determining these, we have to look for other kindsof sur face cues.Because RS relations are delined pragmatically, theirultimate recognition requires understanding of textswhich in turn requires detailed knowledge about theworld.
Furthermore, the condition that the presenta-tional relations are inherently intcutioual, implies thattheir recognition requires knowledge about the writer'sintention, l)lans, etc Because this kind of informationis implicit in texts, its recognition often causes proh-lelns.Ilowew, r, though the writer's intention is implicit,certain linguistic devices give us chtes to infer it.Modality inforntation in a clause, for example, ex-presses the writer's attitude, toward an event/state de-scribed, attd therefore, often gives us clues to recoguisea I{S relation.Let us consider the following two examples:\ [Example  1\](1) I prepared ocuments for a meeting.
(2) I sent them to the head ol\[ice.\ [Example  2\](1)' 1 am preparing documents tbr a meeting.
(2)' 1 have to send them to the head office.Though these two examples describe pairs of similarevents, the relation between (1) and (2) in l~3xample 1is (temporal) Sequence (a subject matter relation) be-cause they simply describe two events which happenedin sequence.
On the other hand, in l~3xample 2, ( l) 'describes an event occurring simultaneously with theutterance, and (2)' concerns what the writer plans todo.
While the two events, preparing documents andsending them, may halH)0.n in this sequence, the rela-1;ion is not regarded as Sequence but as Background.
(2)' gives the reason why the writer is perfomling theaction described by (l)'.This change of I{.S relation occurs due to the dif-ference of ,nodality of (2) and (2)'.
Our basic elai,nin that, though they cmmot determine RS relationsuniquely, inlbrmation of modality and tense of clausesimposes significant constraints on possible I{S rela-tions, and, being used together with other surface cueslike clausal conjunctions, it; Call reasonably restrict aset of possible discourse structures of texts without re-sorting to detailed knowledge about the world mid thewriter's plan.IIowever, the contribution of modality and tense tothe constraints of RS relations is uot straightforward.Both these granunatical \[i~'atures are intertwiued withthe propositional content of clauses.
There\[ore, in o fder to formulate the co~,straints on them properly, wehave first to reveal how the intended effects of RS re-lations can be attained.
This leads to our breakingdown single RS relations into sets of subschemas, eachof which is formulated in terms of the semantic re-lntionshil)s between propositional eontents of clauses,their modality and temporal relationshil)s.3 Propert ies of ClausesLike Mann and Thompson, we use clauses as the ba-sic constituents which are related by RS relations, ex-cept that clausal subjects and completneuts and re-strictive relative clauses are considered parts of theirhost clause.
The constraints which we formulate foreach RS re la t ion  are ex l ) ressed in te rms of propcrtic,sof clauses.
In order to express these eonstra.ints tbr-really, we first introduce the l)asic terms.3.1  Contents  and  Moda l i tyA clause comprises its Contents and Modality.
Modal-ity is the part which expresses the writer's attitudetoward the Contents.While individual anguages have their own linguisticdevices or grmmnatical forms of modality, what sorts ofmodality are exl)ressed by such linguistic devices doesnot vary from one language to another.
For example,although the major linguistic device for nlodality aremodal auxiliary verbs both in l,'mglish anil in Japanese,some kinds of modality expressed in Japanese by modalauxiliary v('.rt)s are expressed by lexical verbs in En-glish, and vice versa.
1Furtherntore, we find nla, ny phrasal or quasiq)hrasalexpressions which consist of several words, and whichcollectively express the writer's attitude toward lheevent/state described.
In order to treat them, weadopt a semantics-based view tbr the delinition ofModality.
That is, we treat expressions which concernthe writer's attitude as modal expressions, whichew;rlinguistic forms they may take.
We \[irst establish aclassification schema of Modality based oH semanticconsiderations (See Section 3.3) and then treat all ex-pressions whose functions can be classified under thisschema as modal expressions.1The concepts expressed 1)y E;nglish lexlcM verbs like wish,hope, be!l, urqe, etc., for exmnple, ave often expressed by lnodalauxiliaries in .\]apanese, when the subject is Ihe writer or speaker.1778(/<intents <)f a clause is delined as the part whichrelna.ills aft, el; r(:lllOV0,l of |;be \[llod\[ll ex|)uessiOll.

:34 Break ing  Down o f  Rhetor i ca lRe la t ionsIn this section, we will show how Background, Enable-ment, Motivation and Evidence of the presentationalrelations are broken down into subschemas, and giveforlnal representations of their constraints.
The colt-straints comprise(a) Semantic Relationships between Contents of thetwo clauses(b) Constraints on Time3This  is not inappropr iate because it is considered that  awriter COltltnits the action in the Clause with full confidence inh is /her  action.
(c) Constraints on Modality.
(b) and (e) are expressed by using a characterisationof clauses of Section 3.
We first show the frameworkfor (a) and then give the actual breakdown of presen-tational relations.4.1  Semant ic  Re la t ionsBy semantic relationships between Contents we meanthe relationships between states/act ions/events de-scribed by Contents in the extra-linguistic world.
4 Aswe nee ill Example I and 2, even when two actions eemto stand in the same semantic relationship, they canbe used to attain dilferent effects on a reader by addingdifferent expression of a writer's attitude as Modalityor putting them in ?lifferent emporal relationships.We classify semantic relationships into five cate-gories, four of which also are subject matter relationsin RST.
That  is, if two Contents are presented withoutany Modality, they stand in the corresponding subjectmatter elations.
We use the following symbols in theirdefinitions.Cli : Clause i composed of Contents and ModalityC i : Coutents of' Clause iSi : Contents of Clause i whose Type is StaticAi : Contents of Clause i whose Type is not StaticMi : ModMity in Clause i\ [Semant ic  Re lat ions \ ]A/~ causes a situation change froln b'i to Sj.
