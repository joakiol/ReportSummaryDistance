STRUCTURE AND INTONATIONIN SPOKEN LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING*Mark SteedmanComputer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania200 South 33rd StreetPhiladelphia PA 19104-6389(steedman@cis.upenn.edu)ABSTRACTThe structure imposed upon spoken sentencesby intonation seems frequently to be orthogo-hal to their traditional surface-syntactic struc-ture.
However, the notion of "intonational struc-ture" as formulated by Pierrehumbert, Selkirk,and others, can be subsumed under a rather dif-ferent notion of syntactic surface structure thatemerges from a theory of grammar based on a"Combinatory" extension to Categorial Gram,mar.
Interpretations of constituents at this levelare in tam directly related to "information struc-ture", or discourse-related notions of "theme","rheme", "focus" and "presupposition".
Somesimplifications appear to follow for the problemof integrating syntax and other high-level mod-ules in spoken language systems.One quite normal prosody (13, below) for an answerto the following question (a) intuitively impotes theintonational structure indicated by the brackets (stress,marked in this case by raised pitch, is indicated bycapitals):(1) a. I know that Alice prefers velveLBut what does MAry prefer?b.
(MAry prefers) (CORduroy).Such a grouping is orthogonal to the traditional syn-tactic structure of the sentence.Intonational structure nevertheless remains tronglyconstrained by meaning.
For example, contours im-posing bracketings like the following are not allowed:(2) #(Three cats)(in ten prefer corduroy)*I am grateful to Steven Bird, Julia Hirschberg, Aravind Joshi,Mitch Marcus, Janet Pierrehumben, a d Bonnie Lynn Webber forcomments and advice.
They are not to blame for any errors in thetranslation oftheir advice into the present form.
The research wassupposed by DARPA grant no.
N0014-85-K0018, and ARO grantno.
DAAL03-89-C003 l.9Halliday \[6\] observed that this constraint, whichSelkirk \[14\] has called the "Sense Unit Condition",seems to follow from the function of phrasal into-nation, which is to convey what will here be called"information structure" - that is, distinctions of focus,presupposition, and propositional ttitude towards en-floes in the discourse model.
These discourse ntitiesare more diverse than mere nounphrase or proposi-tional referents, but they do not include such non-concepts as "in ten prefer corduroy.
"Among the categories that they do include are whatWilson and Sperber and E. Prince \[13\] have termed"open propositions".
One way of introducing an openproposition into the discourse context is by asking aWh-question.
For example, the question in (1), Whatdoes Mary prefer?
introduces an open proposition.As Jackendoff \[7\] pointed out, it is natural to thinkof this open proposition as a functional abstraction,and to express it as follows, using the notation of theA-calculus:(3) Ax \[(prefer' x) mary'\](Primes indicate semantic interpretations whose de-tailed nature is of no direct concern here.)
Whenthis function or concept is supplied with an argu-ment corduroy', it reduces to give a proposition, withthe same function argument relations as the canonicalsentence:(4) (prefer' corduroy') mary'It is the presence of the above open proposition ratherthan some other that makes the intonation contour in(1)b felicitous.
(l~at is not to say that its presenceuniquely determines this response, nor that its explicitmention is necessary for interpreting the response.
)These observations have led linguists such asSelkirk to postulate a level of "intonational struc-ture", independent of syntactic structure and re-lated to information structure.
The theorythat results can be viewed as in Figure 1:directionality of their arguments and the type of theirresult:LF:ArgumentStructureI SurfaceStructure~.____q LF:InformationStructure IIStructure~Phonological  Form(Figure 1: Architecture of Standard MetricalPhonologyThe involvement of two apparently uncoupled lev-els of structure in natural language grammar appearsto complicate the path from speech to interpretationunreasonably, and to thereby threaten a number ofcomputational applications in speech recognition andspeech synthesis.It is therefore interesting to observe that all natu-ral languages include syntactic onstructions whosesemantics i  also reminiscent of functional abstrac-tion.
The most obvious and tractable class are Wh-constructions themselves, in which exactly the samefragments that can be delineated by a single intona-tion contour appear as the residue of the subordinateclause.
Another and much more problematic class offragments results from coordinate constructions.
It isstriking that the residues of wh-movement and con-junction reduction are also subject o something likea "sense unit condition".
For example, strings like"in ten prefer corduroy" are not conjoinable:(5) *Three cats in twenty like velvet,and in ten prefer corduroy.Since coordinate constructions have constituted an-other major source of complexity for theories of nat-ural language grammar, and also offer serious ob-stacles to computational pplications, it is tempt-ing to think that this conspiracy between syntax andprosody might point to a unified notion of structurethat is somewhat different from traditional surfaceconstituency.COMBINATORY GRAMMARS.Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, \[16\]) is anextension of Categorial Grammar (CG).
Elements likeverbs are associated with a syntactic "category" whichidentifies them as functions, and specifies the type and(6) prefers := (S \NP) /NP  : prefer'The category can be regarded as encoding the seman-tic type of their translation, which in the notation usedhere is identified by the expression to the right of thecolon.
Such functions can combine with argumentsof the appropriate ype and position by functional ap-plication:(7) Mary prefers  corduroyI/P (S\NP)/NP NP.

<sBecause the syntactic types are identical to the se-mantic types, apart form directionality, the deriva-tion also builds a compositional interpretation,(prefer' corduroy') mary', and of course such a"pure" categorial grammar is context free.
Coordina-tion might be included in CG via the following rule,allowing constituents of like type to conjoin to yielda single constituent of the same type:(8) X conj X ::~ X(9) I l oath  and detest  ve lvetNP (S\NP)/NP conj (S\NP)//~P NP.ItCs \m' ) /~(The rest of the derivation is omitted, being the sameas in (7).)
In order to allow coordination of con-tiguons strings that do not constitute constituents,CCG generalises the grammar to allow certain op-erations on functions related to Curry's combinators\[3\].
For example, functions may nondeterministicallycompose, as well as apply, under the following rule:(10) Forward Composition:X /Y  : F Y /Z  : G =~, X /Z  : Ax F(Gz)The most important single property of combinatoryrules like this is that they have an invariant semantics.This one composes the interpretations of the functionsthat it applies to, as is apparent from the right handside of the rule.
1 Thus sentences like I suggested,tThe rule uses the notation ofthe ,~-calculus in the semantics,for clarity.
This should not obscure the fact hat it is functionalcomposition itself that is the primitive, not the ,~ operator.10and would prefer, corduroy can be accepted, via thefollowing composition of two verbs (indexed as B,following Curry's nomenclature) to yield a compositeof the same category as a transitive verb.
Crucially,composition also yields the appropriate interpretationfor the composite verb would prefer:(11) suggested and would prefer.

(S\NP)INPCombinatory grammars also include type-raisingrules, which turn arguments into functions overfunctions-over-such-arguments.
The e rules allow ar-guments to compose, and thereby take part in coordi-nations like I suggested, and Mary prefers, corduroy.They too have an invariant compositional semanticswhich ensures that the result has an appropriate inter-pretation.
For example, the following rule allows theconjuncts to form as below (again, the remainder ofthe derivation is omitted):(12) Subject Type-raising:NP  : y :=~ S / (S \NP)  : AF Fy(13) I suggested  and Mary prefers.

Itfollows, according to this view, that they must also bepossible constituents of non-coordinate s ntences likeMary prefers corduroy, as in the following derivation:11(14) Mary prefers corduroy.

>BS/NPS(See \[9\], \[18\] and \[19\] for a discussion of the ob-vious problems for parsing written text that the pres-ence of such "spurious" (i.e.
semantically equivalent)derivations engenders, and for some ways they mightbe overcome.)
An entirely unconstrained combina-tory grammar would in fact allow any bracketing ona sentence, although the grammars we actually writefor configurational l nguages like English are heavilyconstrained by local conditions.
(An example mightbe a condition on the composition rule that is tacitlyassmned below, forbidding the variable Y in the com-position rule to be instantiated asNP, thus excludingconstituents like .\[ate the\]v P/N).The claim of the present paper is simply that par-ticular surface structures that are induced by the spe-cific combinatory grammar that are postulated to ex-plain coordination in English subsume the intona-tional structures that are postulated by Pierrehumbertet al to explain the possible intonation contours forsentences of English.
More specifically, the claim isthat that in spoken utterance, intonation helps to de-termine which of the many possible bracketings per-mitted by the combinatory syntax of English is in-tended, and that the interpretations of the constituentsthat arise from these derivations, far from being "spu-rious", are related to distinctions of discourse focusamong the concepts and open propositions that thespeaker has in mind.The proof of this claim lies in showing that therules of combinatory grammar can be made sensitiveto intonation contour, which limit their application ispoken discourse.
We must also show that the majorconstituents of intonated utterances like (1)b, underthe analyses that are permitted by any given intona-tion, correspond to the information structure of thecontext o which the intonation is appropriate, as in(a) in the example (1) with which the paper begins.This demonstration will be quite simple, once we haveestablished the following notation for intonation con-tours .I shall use a notation which is based on the theoryof Pierrehumbert \[10\], as modified in more recentwork by Selkirk \[14\], Beckman and Pierrehumbert\[1\], \[11\], and Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg \[12\].
Ihave tried as far as possible to take my examples andthe associated intonational nnotations from those au-thors.
The theory proposed below is in principle com-patible with any of the standard escriptive accountsof phrasal intonation.
However, a crucial feature ofPierrehumberts heory for present purposes is thatit distinguishes two subcomponents of the prosodicphrase, the pitch accent and the boundary.
2 Thefirst of these tones or tone-sequences coincides withthe perceived major stress or stresses of the prosodicphrase, while the second marks the righthand bound-ary of the phrase.
These two components are essen-tially invariant, and all other parts of the intonationaltune are interlx)lated.
Pierrehumberts theory thus cap-tures in a very natural way the intuition that the sametune can be spread over longer or shorter strings, inorder to mark the corresponding constituents for theparticular distinction of focus and propositional tti-tude that the melody denotes.
It will help the exposi-tion to augment Pierrehumberts notation with explicitprosodic phrase boundaries, using brackets.
These donot change her theory in any way: all the informationis implicit in the original notation.Consider for example the prosody of the sentenceFred ate the beans in the following pair of discoursesettings, which are adapted from Jackendoff \[7, pp.260\]:(15) Q: I /e l1 ,  what about  the  BEAns?Who ate  THEM?A : FRED ate  the  BEA-ns.
( H* L ) (  L+H* LHg )two tunes are reversed: this time the tune with pitchaccent T.+H* and boundary LH% is spread across aprosodic phrase Fred ate, while the other tune withpitch accent H* and boundary LL% is carried by theprosodic phrase the beans (again starting with an in-terpolated or null tone).
4The meaning that these tunes convey is intuitivelyvery obvious.
As Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg pointout, the latter tune seems to be used to mark some orall of that part of the sentence expressing informationthat the speaker believes to be novel to the hearer.
Intraditional terms, it marks the "comment" - more pre-cisely, what Halliday called the '~rheme'.
In contrast,the r.+H* LH% tune seems to be used to mark someor all of that part of the sentence which expresses in-formation which in traditional terms is the "topic" -in I-lalliday's terms, the "theme".
5 For present pur-poses, a theme can be thought of as conveying whatthe speaker assumes to be the subject of mutual inter-est, and this particular tune marks a theme as novelto the conversation as a whole, and as standing ina contrastive relation to the previous one.
(If thetheme is not novel in this sense, it receives no tonein Pierrehumbert's erms, and may even be left outaltogether.)
6 Thus in (16), the L+H* Lrt% phrase in-cluding this accent is spread across the phrase Fredate.
7 Similarly, in (15), the same tune is confined tothe object of the open proposition ate the beans, be-cause the intonation of the original question indicatesthat eating beans as opposed to some other comestibleis the new topic, s(16) q: I /e l l ,  what about  FRED?What did HE eat7A: FRED ate the BEAns.
( L+H* LH~ )( H* LL~ )In these contexts, the main stressed syllables on bothFred and the beans receive a pitch accent, but a dif-ferent one.
In the former example, (15), there is aprosodic phrase on Fred made up of the pitch accentwhich Pierrehumbert calls H*, immediately followedby an r. boundary.
There is another prosodic phrasehaving the pitch accent called L+H* on beans, pre-ceded by null or interpolated tone on the words atethe, and immediately followed by a boundary whichis written LH%.
(I base these annotations on Pierre-humber and Hirschberg's \[12, ex.
33\] discussion ofthis example.)
3 In the second example (16) above, the2For the purpose s of this abstract, I am ignoring the distinctionbetween the intonational phrase proper, and what Pierrehumbenand her colleagues call the "intermediate" phrase, which differ inrespect of boundary tone-sequences.3I continue to gloss over Pierrehumbert's di tinction between*'intermediate" and "intonational" phrases.COMBINATORY PROSODYThe r,+H* r,H% intonational melody in example (16)belongs to a phrase Fred ate ... which correspondsunder the combinatory theory of grammar to a gram-4The reason for notating the latter boundary as LLg, rather thanL is again to do with the distinction between intonational nd in-termediate phrases.5The concepts of theme and rheme are closely related to Groszet als \[5\] concepts of "backward looking center" and "forwardlooking center".6Here I depart slightly from Halliday's definition.
The presentpaper also follows Lyons \[8\] in rejecting Hallidays' claim that thetheme must necessarily be sentence-initial.ran  alternative prosody, in which the contrastive tune is con-fined to Fred, seems equally coherent, and may be the one intendedby Jackendoff.
I befieve that his altemative is informationally dis-tinct, and arises from an ambiguity as to whether the topic of thisdiscourse is Fred or What Fred ate.
It too is accepted by the rulesbelow.SNore that the position of the pitch accent in the phrase has todo with a further dimension of information structure within boththeme and theme, which me might identify as "focus': I ignorethis dimension here.12matical constituent, complete with a translation equiv-alent to the open proposition Az\[(ate' z) fred'\].
Thecombinatory theory thus offers a way to derive suchintonational phrases, using only the independentlymotivated rules of combinatory grammar, entirely un-der the control of appropriate intOnation contOurs likeL+H*  LH%.
9It is extremely simple tO make the existing combi-natory grammar do this.
We interpret the two pitchaccents as functions over boundaries, of the followingtypes: I0(17) L+H*  := Theme/BhH*  := Rheme/B l- that is, as functions over boundary tOnes into thetwo major informational types, the Hallidean "theme"and "rheme".
The reader may wonder at this pointwhy we do not replace the category Theme by afunctional category, say Ut terance /Rheme,  cor-responding to its semantic type.
The answer is thatwe do not want this category to combine with any-thing but a complete rheme.
In particular, it must notcombine with a function into the category Rhemeby functional composition.
Accordingly we give ita non-functional category, and supply the followingspecial purpose prosodic ombinatory rules:(18) Theme Rheme =~ Ut teranceRheme Theme =~ Ut teranceWe next define the various boundary tOnes as ar-guments to these functions, as follows:(19) LH% := BhLL% := B1L := B1(As usual, we ignore for present purposes the distinc-tion between intermediate- and intonational- phraseboundaries.)
Finally, we accomplish the effect of in-terpolation of other parts of the tune by assigning thefollowing polymorphic category to all elements bear-ing no tOne specification, which we will represent asthe tOne 0:(20) 0 := x /x9I am grateful to Steven Bird for discussions on the followingproposal.1?An alternative (which would actually be closer to Pierrchum-bert and Hirschberg's own proposal to compositionally assemblediscourse meanings from more primitive lements of meaning car-fled by each individual tone) would be to make the boundary tonethe function and the pitch accent an argument.13Syntactic ombination can then be made subject othe following simple restriction:(21) The Prosodic Constituent Condition: Com-bination of two syntactic ategories via asyntactic ombinatory ule is only allowed iftheir prosodic ategories can also combine.
(The prosodic and syntactic ombinatory rules neednot be the same).This principle has the sole effect of excluding cer-tain derivations for spoken utterances that would beallowed for the equivalent written sentences.
For ex-ample, consider the derivations that it permits for ex-ample (16) above.
The rule of forward composition isallowed tO apply tO the words Fred and ate, becausethe prosodic categories can combine (by functionalapplication):(22) Fred ate ...( L+H* LHZ ).

Moreover, the theory permits no other deriva-tion for this intonation contour.
Of course, repeatedapplication of the composition rule, as in (23), wouldallow the L+H* LH% contour to spread further, as in(FRED must have eaten)(the BEANS).In contrast, the parallel derivation is forbidden bythe prosodic onstituent condition for the alternativeintonation contour on (15).

)S: ear'(the' beams') ~red'UtteranceNo other analysis is allowed for (25).
Again, thederivation divides the sentence into new and given in-formation consistent with the context given in the ex-ample.
The effect of the derivation is to annotate theentire predicate as an L+H* LH%.
It is emphasisedthat this does not mean that the tone is spread, but thatthe whole constituent is marked for the correspondingdiscourse function - -  roughly, as contrastive given,or theme.
The finer grain information that it is the ob-ject that is contrasted, while the verb is given, residesin the tree itself.
Similarly, the fact that boundary se-quences are associated with words at the lowest levelof the derivation does not mean that they are partof the word, or specified in the lexicon, nor that theword is the entity that they are a boundary of.
It is14prosodic phrases that they bound, and these also aredefined by the tree.All the other possibilities for combining these twocontours on this sentence are shown elsewhere \[17\]to yield similarly unique and contextually appropriateinterpretations.Sentences like the above, including markedtheme and rheme expressed as two distinct intona-tionalAntermediate phrases are by that token unam-biguous as to their information structure.
However,sentences like the following, which in Pierrehum-berts' terms bear a single intonational phrase, aremuch more ambiguous as to the division that theyconvey between theme and rheme:(26) I read a book about CORduroy( H*  LL% )Such a sentence is notoriously ambiguous as to theopen proposition it presupposes, for it seems equallyapropriate as a response to any of the following ques-tions:(27) a.
What did you read a book about?b.
What did you read?c.
What did you do?Such questions could in suitably contrastive contextsgive rise to themes marked by the L+H* LH% tune,bracketing the sentence as follows:(28) a.
(1 read a book about)(CORduroy)b.
(I read)(a book about CORduroy)c. (I)(read a book about CORduroy)It seems that we shall miss a generalisation concern-ing the relation of intonation to discourse informationunless we extend Pierrehumberts theory very slightly,to allow null intermediate phrases, without pitch ac-cents, expressing unmarked themes.
Since the bound-aries of such intermediate phrases are not explicitlymarked, we shall immediately allow all of the aboveanalyses for (26).
Such a modification to the theorycan be introduced by the following rule, which non-deterministically allows certain constituents bearingthe null tone to become a theme:(29) r. r~X/X ::~ ThemeThe symbol E is a variable ranging over syntacticcategories that are (leftward- or rightward- looking)functions into S. al The rule is nondeterministic, so itcorrectly continues to allow a further analysis of theentire sentence as a single Intonational Phrase convey-ing the Rheme.
Such an utterance is the appropriateresponse to yet another open-proposition establishingquestion, What happened?.
)With this generalisation, we are in a position tomake the following claim:(30) The structures demanded by the theory of in-tonation and its relation to contextual infor-marion are the same as the surface syntac-tic structures permitted by the combinatorygrammar.A number of corollaries follow, such as the following:(31) Anything which can coordinate can be anintonational constituent, and vice versa.CONCLUSIONThe pathway between phonological form and inter-pretation can now be viewed as in Figure 2:I Logical Form= Argument StructureZSurface Structure-- Intonation Structure= Information StructureI Ph?n?l?gi  P?rm IFigure 2: Architecture of a CCG-based ProsodySuch an architecture is considerably simpler than theone shown earlier in Figure 1.
Phonological formmaps via the rules of combinatory grammar directlyonto a surface structure, whose highest level con-stituents correspond to intonational constituents, an-notated as to their discourse function.
Surface struc-ture therefore subsumes intonational structure.
It alsosubsumes information structure, since the translationsof those surface constituents correspond to the enti-ties and open propositions which constitute the topicor theme (if any) and the comment or rheme.
These in11The inclusion in the full grammar of further oles of type-raising in addition to the subject rule discussed above means thatthe set of categories over which ~ ranges is larger than it is possibleto reveal in the present paper.
(For example, it includes objectcomplements).
See the earlier papers and \[17\] for digcussion.15turn reduce via functional application to yield canon-ical function-argument structure, or "logical form".There may be significant advantages for automaticspoken language understanding in such a theory.Most obviously, where in the past parsing and phono-logical processing have tended to deliver conflictingstructural analyses, and have had to be pursued inde-pendently, they now are seen to be in concert.
That isnot to say that intonational cues remove all local struc-tural ambiguity.
Nor should the problem of recognis-ing cues like boundary tones be underestimated, forthe acoustic realisation in the fundamental frequencyF0 of the intonational tunes discussed above is en-tirely dependent upon the rest of the phonology -that is, upon the phonemes and words that bear thetune.
It therefore seems most unlikely that intona-tional contour can be identified in isolation from wordrecognition.
12What the isomorphism between syntactic structureand intonational structure does mean is that simplystructured modular processors which use both sourcesof information at once can be more easily devised.Such an architecture may reasonably be expected tosimplify the problem of resolving local structural am-biguity in both domains.
For example, a syntacticanalysis that is so closely related to the structure ofthe signal should be easier to use to "filter" the am-biguities arising from lexical recognition.However, it is probably more important hat theconstituents that arise under this analysis are alsosemantically interpreted.
The interpretations are di-rectly related to the concepts, referents and themesthat have been established in the context of discourse,say as the result of a question.
These discourse n-tities are in turn directly reducible to the structuresinvolved in knowledge-representation and inference.The direct path from speech to these higher levels ofanalysis offered by the present theory should thereforemake it possible to use more effectively the muchmore powerful resources of semantics and domain-specific knowledge, including knowledge of the dis-course, to filter low-level ambiguities, using largergrammars of a more expressive class than is cur-rently possible.
While vast improvements in purelybottom-up word recognition can be expected to con-rinue, such filtering is likely to remain crucial to suc-cessful speech processing by machine, and appears tobe characteristic of all levels of human processing,for both spoken and written language.12This is no bad thing.
The converse also applies: intonationcontour effects the acoustic r alisation ofwords, particularly withrespect o timing.
It is therefore likely that he benefits of combin-ing intonational recognition a d word recognition will be mutual.REFERENCES\[1\] Beckman, Mary and Janet Pierrehumbert: 1986,'Intonational Structure in Japanese and English',Phonology Yearbook, 3, 255-310.\[2\] Chomsky, Noam: 1970, 'Deep Structure, Sur-face Structure, and Semantic Interpretation', inD.
