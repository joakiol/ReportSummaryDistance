Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1432?1441,Austin, Texas, November 1-5, 2016. c?2016 Association for Computational LinguisticsPersonalized Emphasis Framing for Persuasive Message GenerationTao Ding and Shimei PanDepartment of Information SystemsUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County{taoding01,shimei}@umbc.eduAbstractIn this paper, we present a study on per-sonalized emphasis framing which can beused to tailor the content of a messageto enhance its appeal to different individ-uals.
With this framework, we directlymodel content selection decisions based ona set of psychologically-motivated domain-independent personal traits including person-ality (e.g., extraversion) and basic humanvalues (e.g., self-transcendence).
We alsodemonstrate how the analysis results can beused in automated personalized content selec-tion for persuasive message generation.1 IntroductionPersuasion is an integral part of our personal andprofessional lives.
The topic of generating per-suasive messages has been investigated in differentfields with varied focuses.
Psychologists focus onthe cognitive, social and emotional processes of apersuader and a persuadee to understand what makesa communication persuasive (Hovland et al, 1953;Petty and Cacioppo, 1986; Smith and Petty, 1996).Marketing researchers are interested in applying the-ories of persuasion in promoting consumer products(Szybillo and Heslin, 1973; Han and Shavitt, 1994;Campbell and Kirmani, 2000; Kirmani and Camp-bell, 2004; Ford, 2005; Hirsh et al, 2012).
NaturalLanguage Generation (NLG) researchers are inter-ested in studying the relation between language us-age and persuasion in order to build automated sys-tems that produce persuasive messages (Guerini etal., 2011; Reiter et al, 2003).It is also generally believed that persuasion ismore effective when it is custom-tailored to reflectthe interests and concerns of the intended audience(Noar et al, 2007; Dijkstra, 2008; Hirsh et al,2012).
A proven tailoring tactic commonly used bypoliticians, marketing executives, as well as publichealth advocators is content framing (Meyerowitzand Chaiken, 1987; Maheswaran and Meyers-Levy,1990; Grewal et al, 1994; Rothman and Salovey,1997).
Previous framing research has mainly fo-cused on two types of framing strategies: empha-sis framing and equivalence framing.
To emphasisframe a message is to simplify reality by focusing ona subset of the aspects of a situation or an issue andmake them more prominent in a communication topromote certain definition, causal interpretation andmoral evaluation (Entman and Rojecki, 1993).
Forexample, in political debating, the topic of nuclearenergy can be framed as an economic developmentissue, a safety issue or an environmental issue.
Inmarketing, the same car can be framed as a low costcar, a performance car, or a green car.
With differ-ent framing strategies, the authors try to appeal toindividuals with different beliefs and concerns.
Incontrast, equivalence framing focuses on presentingcontent as either loss-framed or gain-framed mes-sages.
For example, a smoking cessation messagecan employ a gain-frame like ?You will live longer ifyou quit smoking?, or a loss-frame such as ?You willdie sooner if you do not quit smoking?.
Even thoughthe messages are equivalent factually, the frames caninfluence a receiver?s behavior either to encourage adesirable behavior or to avoid an unwanted outcome(Tversky and Kahneman, 1981).
In this study, wefocus on personalized emphasis framing which se-lectively emphasize the aspects of an entity (e.g., acar) to enhance its appeal to a given receiver.Using emphasis framing as the framework forpersonalized content selection, we can take ad-vantage of rich findings in prior framing re-search that link content selection decisions to a setof psychologically-motivated domain-independentpersonal characteristics.
This has made ourwork more generalizable than those relying onapplication-specific user characteristics (e.g., use anindividual?s smoking habit to tailor a smoke ces-sation message).
Since content framing is a partof the content determination process, the model wepropose is a part of the content planner in a Natu-ral Language Generation (NLG) system (Reiter and1432Dale, 1997).There are three main contributions of this work.1.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ef-fort in building an automated model of empha-sis framing for personalized persuasive mes-sage generation.2.
We made content selection decisions based ona set of psychologically-motivated application-independent user traits, such as personalityand basic human values, which makes ourwork more generalizable than those relying ondomain-specific user characteristics and prefer-ences.3.
We propose a cascade content selection modelthat integrates personalized content selectionpatterns in automated persuasive message gen-eration.2 Related WorkIn the following, we summarize the research that ismost relevant to our work including prior psychol-ogy and communication studies that link emphasisframing with personal traits.
Since building com-putational models of emphasis framing was not theprimary goal in these studies, we also include litera-ture on personalized Natural Language Generation.2.1 Emphasis framing and Personal TraitsThere is a large body of social, marketing and com-munication theories on framing effects.
(Zaller,1992; Zaller and Feldman, 1992) point out thatframing essentially reorganizes information to in-crease accessibility of an issue dimension by high-lighting one cognitive path that had previously beenin the dark.
Others argue that the framing effect isdue to a change in the rank order of the values as-sociated with different aspects through the interac-tion with the content found within a message (Nel-son et al, 1997; Chong and Druckman, 2007; Ja-coby, 2000).
The human decisions are controlledpartly by the formulation of the problem and partlyby the norms, habits, and personal characteristics ofthe decision-maker (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981).Although most research agrees that the character-istics of a receiver play an important role in fram-ing effectiveness, there is a significant disagreementin what characteristics of a receiver result in fram-ing effects.
For example, (Anderson, 2010) statesthat people with prior attitudes toward an issue canbe influenced by frames, while Slothuus (Slothuus,2008) and Tabor et al (Taber et al, 2009) did notfind a framing effect for those with strong values as-sociated with an issue prior to exposure to the frame.The mixed results may be due to the fact that manyof these studies did not take into account that peoplewith different traits (e.g., different personality) mayreact to framing strategies differently.Recently, personalized framing, especiallypersonality-based framing research has become ahot topic.
Among them, Hirsh (2012) investigateswhether a persuasive appeal?s effectiveness canbe increased by aligning message framing witha recipient?s personality profile.
In this study,for a given mobile phone, they constructed fiveadvertisements, each designed to target one of thefive major personality traits.
Their results indicatethat advertisements were evaluated more positivelywhen they cohered with participants?
personality.In a separate study, (Conroy et al, 2012) foundthat certain personality traits, particularly openness,agreeableness, and conscientiousness mediateframing effects when participants were presentedwith different frames of political and health issuessuch as civil liberties, medical treatments, energy,affirmative action, and gun control.Inspired by the above research, we also employpsychologically-motivated trait models to captureindividual characteristics.
In addition to personality,we also incorporate basic human values since fram-ing effects were also shown to be related to personalbeliefs and motivations.
As a result, we have signifi-cantly increased the scope of our study over prior re-search.
Moreover, unlike prior research where onlymessages hand-crafted by experts were used, we areinterested in building computational models to auto-matically select a subset of the aspects to highlightbased on personal traits.2.2 Personalized NLGThere is also a large body of work on personalizedNatural Language Generation (NLG).
For example,STOP is a Natural Language Generation (NLG) sys-tem that generates tailored smoking cessation let-ters based on a user?s responses to a four-page1433smoking questionnaire (Reiter et al, 2003); PER-SIVAL customizes the content of search summariesbased on its relevance to a given patient?s healthrecord (McKeown et al, 2003); MATCH (John-ston et al, 2002) is a multimodal dialogue sys-tem that tailors the content of its responses basedon a user?s restaurant preferences; M-PIRO (Bu-renhult, 2002) tailors the words and the complex-ity of museum object descriptions for different au-diences (e.g.
adults, children, and experts); PER-SONAGE (Mairesse and Walker, 2011) and CRAG2 (Gill et al, 2012) vary linguistic styles to projectintended personality in spoken utterances.
In ad-dition, Carenini and Moore (Carenini and Moore,2006) employed a multiattribute utility theory-baseduser preference model for personalized evaluativeargument generation.
Among them, STOP, PER-SIVAL and MATCH use domain-specific user mod-els while M-PIRO, PERSONAGE and GRAG2 em-ploy domain independent user properties, such asexpertise and personality.
For PERSONAGE andGRAG2, personality traits are mainly used to adaptlinguistic styles.
So far, there has not been muchwork focusing on using domain-independent usertraits to automatically adapt message content to im-prove its persuasive appeal.3 Acquiring Personal TraitsSince prior study often links framing effects to in-dividual characteristics such as personality and in-dividual motivations and beliefs, here we focus ontwo widely-accepted trait models in psychology:the Big5 personality model (Goldberg, 1993) andSchwartz?s basic human value model (Schwartz,2003).
Figure 1 shows the description of each of theBig5 personality traits along with each of the fivebasic human value traits.To acquire the personality and value traits of aperson, traditionally, psychometric tests, such as theIPIP test for Big 5 personality (Yarkoni, 2010a) andthe PVQ survey for values (Schwartz, 2003), wereused.
Recent research in the field of psycholinguis-tics has shown that it is possible to automaticallyinfer personal traits from one?s linguistic footprint,such as tweets, Facebook posts and blogs (Yarkoni,2010b; Celli and Polonio, 2013; Chen et al, 2014).Unlike psychometric tests, automated trait analysisFigure 1: Description of Two Trait Modelsallows us to infer personal traits for a large numberof people, which makes it possible to scale up auto-mated personal persuasion for a very large popula-tion (e,g., millions of social media users).4 Acquiring Author Framing StrategyFraming effects are often subtle and may be influ-enced by many factors, such as the credibility of theauthors, the personality of the receivers and the con-text of the communication.
In the first study, weinvestigate whether it is feasible to build a person-alized content selection model based on a writer?s(a.k.a.
an author?s) content framing strategies.To investigate this, we first randomly generatedten cars, each include eight aspects: safety, fueleconomy, quality, style, price, luxury, performanceand durability.
The value of each aspect was ran-domly generated on a 5-point Likert scale: ?1 (verybad)?, ?2 (bad)?, ?3 (average)?, ?4 (good)?, and ?5(excellent)?.
We also conducted a large-scale per-sonality and basic human value survey on AmazonMechanical Turk (AMT).
We used the 50-item IPIPsurvey (Goldberg, 1993) to obtain a Amazon Me-chanical Turk worker (a.k.a.
Turker)?s personal-ity scores and the 21-item PVQ survey (Schwartz,2003) to obtain his/her basic value scores.
To en-1434sure the quality of the data from AMT, we addedtwo qualification criteria.
A qualified Turker must(1) have submitted over 5000 tasks (2) with an ac-ceptance rate over 95%.
The survey also includedseveral validation questions, which are pairs of ques-tions that are paraphrases of each other.
If the an-swers to a pair of validation questions are signifi-cantly different, the user data were excluded fromour analysis.
After removing invalid data, we col-lected the traits of 836 Turkers.
The raw personalityscores, ranging from 10 to 50, and raw value scores,ranging from 1 to 6, were computed directly fromthe survey answers.
The normalized trait scores,ranging from 0 to 1, were computed using their rankpercentiles in this population.In addition, we designed two Human IntelligenceTasks (HITs) on AMT: a content customization taskand a validation task.
In the content customizationtask (a.k.a.
Task 1), a Turker was asked to selectone car aspect to emphasize in his message for a re-ceiver.
The validation task (a.k.a.
Task 2) was usedto validate whether a receiver prefers the messagecustomized for her or not.Specifically, in Task 1, the Turkers were asked toimagine that they work for a marketing firm on acampaign to promote a new car.
Each Turker wasgiven the specification of a car ( randomly selectedfrom the 10 randomly generated cars) and a receiver(randomly selected from the 836 Turkers whose traitscores were known to us).
The Turker was asked towrite a campaign message to persuade the receiverto buy the car.
But the Turker can only select one ofthe eight car aspects to include in his message.
Sincecustomizing a message based on an interaction of allten traits can be very challenging for a Turker, weused a simplified trait profile in our study.
The sim-plified trait profile contains only two traits: the mostprominent personality trait and the most prominentvalue trait.
The prominence of a trait was definedbased on the normalized trait score.
The more dif-ferent a trait score is from the median (.50), the moreprominent the trait is.
For comparison, for the samecar, we also asked the same writer to select a car as-pect for someone who has an opposite trait profile.The opposite trait profile is defined as the one that ismost different from the given trait profile (with thelowest cosine similarity).
After the writer selecteda car aspect, he also wrote a campaign message us-ing the selected aspect.
Overall, after removing in-valid data, we collected 490 pairs of messages for131 pairs of receivers.To validate the framing effect, in Task 2, we askeda new set of Turkers (receivers) to first complete anIPIP personality survey and a PVQ human value sur-vey.
Based on the survey results, we computed thetrait profile for each of them.
In addition, for eachreceiver in Task 2, we matched his/her trait profilewith the 131 pairs of trait profiles collected in Task1.
The profile with the highest matching score (com-puted based on cosine similarity) was selected andits associated message pair was retrieved.Then we presented the receiver with a pair ofmessages, one created for someone with matchingtrait profile, the other for someone with the oppo-site trait profile.
We also randomized the order thesemessages were presented.
Finally, we asked the re-ceivers to rate which message they prefer more.
Ifthe framing strategies used by the Turkers (authors)in Task 1 were effective, then the Turkers (receivers)in Task 2 will prefer the messages tailored for themmore than the ones tailored for someone with theopposite trait profile.
Overall, after filtering out in-valid data, we have collected the results from 145 re-ceivers.
Among them, 77 prefer the messages writ-ten for them, while 68 prefer the messages writtenfor someone with the opposite trait profiles.
Weperformed a sign test to determine whether the dif-ference is statistically significant and the result wasnegative (p < 0.2).Although moderate personalization effects werefound in previous framing research, only expert-crafted messages were used (Hirsh et al, 2012).Here, when Turkers (mostly non-experts) wereasked to customize the messages based on a re-ceiver?s traits, no significant effects were found.Since authors?
emphasis framing strategies were noteffective, we can not directly use authors?
data tolearn their emphasis framing strategies.
Next, wepresent several experiments designed to automati-cally derive emphasis framing strategies based ona receiver?s traits and his/her aspect selection deci-sions.14355 Learning Emphasis Framing StrategiesTo derive emphasis framing patterns based on a re-ceiver?s traits and his/her aspect selection decisions,we designed another HIT (Task 3) on AMT to col-lect data.
In Task 3, each Turker was asked to takethe IPIP and PVQ surveys so that we can obtainhis/her Big5 personality and value scores.
In addi-tion, we also asked him/her to rank all eight car as-pects based on their importance to him/her.
To con-trol the influence of the value of a car aspect on auser?s aspect selection decision (e.g., if the value of?safety?
is ?poor?
and the value of ?fuel economy?is ?good?, to promote the car, people almost alwaysdescribe it as ?a car with good fuel economy?, not?an unsafe car?, regardless of a receiver?s personal-ity).
In this study, we kept the values of all car as-pects unspecified.
After removing invalid data, ourdataset has 594 responses, each contains a Turker?spersonality and value scores as well as his/her rankof the eight car aspects.
In the following, we de-scribe how we analyze the relationship between as-pect rank and personal traits.5.1 Pattern Discovery with RegressionIn our first study, we employed regression analysisto identify significant correlations between personaltraits and aspect ranks.
Specifically, we trained eightlinear regression models, one for each of the eightcar aspects.
The dependent variable in each modelis the rank of an aspect (from 1 to 8) and the in-dependent variables are the ten user traits.
In theregression analysis, we only focused on the maineffects since a full interaction model with ten traitswill require much more data to train.
Since the rawscores of the personality and value traits use differ-ent scales, we normalized these scores so that theyare all from 0 to 1.
Table 1 shows the regressionresults.Several interesting patterns were discovered inthis analysis: (a) a positive correlation between therank of ?luxury?
and ?self-enhancement?, a trait of-ten associated with people who pursue self-interestsand value social status, prestige and personal suc-cess (p < 0.0001).
This pattern suggests that to pro-mote a car to someone who scores high on ?self-enhancement?, we need to highlight the ?luxury?aspect of a car.
(b) the rank of ?safety?
is posi-tively correlated with ?conservation?, a trait associ-ated with people who conform to tradition and pur-sue safety, harmony, and stability (p < 0.005).
Thisresult suggests that for someone values ?conserva-tion?, it is better to emphasize ?car safety?
in a per-sonalized sales message.
(c) ?self-transcendence?,a trait often associated with people who pursue theprotection of the welfare of others and the nature,is positively correlated with the rank of ?fuel econ-omy?
(p < 0.005) but negatively correlated with therank of ?style?
(p < 0.005).
This suggests that forsomeone who values ?self-transcendence?, it is bet-ter to emphasize ?fuel economy?, but not so much on?style?.
Other significant correlations uncovered inthis analysis include a negative correlation betweencar ?price?
and ?conservation?
(p < 0.005), a nega-tive correlation between car ?safety?
and ?conscien-tiousness?
(p < 0.05), and a positive correlation be-tween ?openness to change?
and car ?performance?
(p < 0.05).5.2 Pattern Discovery with ConstrainedClusteringIn the regression analysis, we only considered themain framing effects.
In order to discover high-orderinteraction patterns with limited data, we want touse clustering to group people with similar traits to-gether.
In addition, we also want that the people in acluster share similar aspect preferences.
Otherwise,we won?t be able to link the trait patterns discoveredin a cluster with specific aspect preferences.
Thus,we employed constrained clustering in this analysis.With constrained clustering, we can ensure the ho-mogeneity of the aspect preferences within each re-sulting cluster.To facilitate this analysis, first we mapped theaspect ranks obtained in Task 3 into discrete cate-gories.
For a complete rank of eight car aspects, wemapped the top three ranked aspects to an ?Impor-tant?
class, bottom three to a ?Not-Important?
class,and the middle two to a ?Neutral?
class.
In addi-tion, we encoded the aspect homogeneity require-ment as constraints.
Typically, constrained cluster-ing incorporates either a set of must-link constraints,a set of cannot-link constraints, or both.
A must-link constraint is used to specify that the two datainstances in the must-link relation should be placedin the same cluster.
A cannot-link constraint is used1436Table 1: Results of the Regression AnalysisSafety Fuel Quality Style Price Luxury Perf DurabAgreeableness 0.39 -0.52 -0.53 0.54 0.81 0.004 -0.62 -0.27Conscientiousness -1.75 * -0.31 0.80 0.29 -0.01 0.27 0.83 -0.12Extroversion 0.69 -0.71 0.008 -0.25 -0.37 0.48 -0.07 0.224Neurotisim 1.08 -0.01 -0.46 -0.11 -0.32 -0.07 0.18 -0.28Openness 1.59 -0.05 0.01 -0.99 0.36 -0.53 -0.46 0.07Conservation 1.99 ** -0.99 -0.66 0.84 -1.72 ** 0.21 0.38 -0.03Hedonism 1.47 -0.15 -0.69 0.16 0.51 -0.06 -0.82 -0.43Openness to change -2.15 0.08 0.58 0.48 -1.99 * -0.38 2.29* 1.07Self-enhancement -1.39 -1.12 0.58 0.47 -0.31 2.41 *** 0.77 -1.41Self-transcendence 1.33 2.37 ** 1.36 -2.47 ** -0.91 -1.01 -0.33 -0.32Note: p < 0.05, ** p < 0.005, *** p < 0.0001Table 2: Patterns Discovered in Clustering AnalysisFeature Cluster Accuracy Label Significant traitsSafety1 0.7 Important Extrave(+),Neuroti(+)2 0.64 Neutral Conscie(+),Hedonis(+),Open(+),Self-en(+)3 0.71 Important Conscie(+),Open(-)Fuel 1 0.54 Neutral Open(-),Self-en(-)2 0.54 Not-Important Hedonis(+),Open(+),Self-en(+)Quality1 0.43 Important Extrave(+),Neuroti(+)2 0.45 Non-Important Hedonis(+),Open(+),Self-en(+)3 0.45 Not-Important Conscie(+),Open(-)Style1 0.5 Not-Important Hedonis(-),Open(-)2 0.55 Neutral Conscie(+),Extrave(+),Neuroti(+)3 0.62 Neutral Conscie(+),Hedonis(+),Open(+),Self-en(+)4 0.74 Not-Important Conscie(+),Open(-)Performance1 0.73 Neutral Extrave(+),Neuroti(+)2 0.5 Neutral Conscie(+),Open(-)3 0.4 Not-Important Hedonis(-),Open(-)Durability 1 0.56 Not-Important Extrave(+),Hedonis(+),Self-en(+)2 0.36 Important Conscie(+),Hedonis(+),Open(+),Self-en(+)Note: CV < 0.12 P < 0.001Diff > 0.2to specify that the two instances in the cannot-linkrelation should not be put in the same cluster.
Theseconstraints act as a guide for which a constrainedclustering algorithm will use to find clusters that sat-isfy these requirements.To encode the homogeneity constraint, for eachcar aspect (e.g.
safety), we can simply add must-links between every pair of Turkers if they share thesame aspect preference (e.g., both consider ?safety?important) and add cannot-links for every pair ofTurkers who do not share the same aspect prefer-ences (e.g., one Turker considers ?safety?
?Impor-tant?, the other considers it ?Not-Important?).
Butwith both must-links and cannot-links, it is verylikely we will get three big clusters, each is related toone of the three categories: Important, Neutral andNot-Important.
Although the resulting clusters sat-isfy the aspect preference homogeneity requirement,they fail to group people with similar traits together.As a result, in this analysis, we only used cannot-links, which not only guarantees the homogeneity ofaspect preferences, but also creates smaller clustersthat group people with similar traits together.We employed the Metric Pairwise ConstrainedKMeans algorithm (MPCK-MEANS) (Bilenko etal., 2004) to incorporate the aspect preference ho-mogeneity requirement.
The optimal cluster numberK was determined empirically by running MPCK-MEANS with different Ks, K ?
[3, 20] (3 is theminimum number of clusters since we have 3 differ-ent aspect preference categories).To determine whether the resulting clusters cap-ture any interesting patterns, we used two patternselection criteria (a) a homogeneity criterion whichrequires that there is at least one trait whose values inthe cluster is relatively homogeneous; (b) a distinc-tiveness criterion which requires that for the traitsidentified in (a), their cluster means need to be sig-nificantly different from the population means.
For(a), we used the coefficient of variation (CV) as thehomogeneity measure.
CV, also known as relativestandard deviation (RSD), is a standardized measureof dispersion of a probability or count distribution.It is often expressed as a percentage and is definedas the ratio of the standard deviation ?
to the mean|?|.
In the study, we required that all the CVs of1437homogeneous traits to be lower than 0.12.
For (b)we required that the differences of the means needto be significant based on an independent sample t-test with p < 0.001 and the difference of means isgreater than 0.2.Table 2 highlights some of the patterns discoveredusing this approach.
In this table, we list the clusterid, cluster label (Important, Not-Important, Neutral),clustering accuracy, and significant traits in the clus-ter (?+?
indicates that the cluster mean is higher thanpopulation mean, ?-?
means the opposite).
For ex-ample, based on the Safety-1 pattern, people whoare more extraverted (extrave (+)) and more neu-rotic (neurotic (+)) tend to consider ?car safety?
im-portant.
Similarly, based on pattern Safety-3, peo-ple who are more conscientious (conscie(+)) butless open (open(-)) tend to consider ?safety?
impor-tant.
Other interesting patterns include: people whoare less open (open(-)) and do not value hedonism(hedomis (-)) don?t consider performance very im-portant (performance-3), and people who are moreextraverted (extrave(+)), value hedonism and self-enhancement (hedonis(+), self-en(+)) do not thinkdurability important (durability-1).6 Apply Emphasis Framing in NLGThe patterns derived in the previous section can beused in personalized content selection for NaturalLanguage Generation.
In general, to promote a car,people tend to highlight the good aspects and avoidthe bad aspects, regardless of a receiver?s person-ality.
For example, people will likely to highlightthe fuel economy aspect if a car is very fuel efficientwhile de-highlight the same aspect if a car is not fuelefficient.
Thus, during content selection, to take thevalue of an aspect into consideration, we employ acascade NLG model that integrates value-based con-tent selection with trait-based personalization.The input to the cascade content selection modelincludes: (1) the values of all the car aspects; (2)the trait scores of a receiver; (3) the eight linear-regression models learned in Section 5.2, one foreach aspect; (4) the interaction rules learned in Sec-tion 5.3; (5) n, the number of aspects needed in theoutput; (6) the value difference threshold ?1 that de-termines whether the values of two or more aspectsare significantly different; (7) the rank differencethreshold ?2 that determines whether the ranks oftwo or more aspects predicted by the linear regres-sion models are significantly different.To select n aspects to emphasize, our system firstranks all the aspects based on their values.
If thevalue of the n-th aspect vn is significantly better thanthat of the (n+1)-th aspect vn+1 (i.e., their differenceis greater than ?1), we output the top n aspects di-rectly.
Otherwise, for all the aspects whose valuesare either the same or not significantly worse thanvn, their ranks will be determined by the trait-basedlinear regression models.
Moreover, after re-rankingrelevant aspects based on the predicted ranks fromthe regression models, if the predicted rank of then-th aspect rn is significantly better than that ofthe (n+1)-th aspect rn+1 (i.e., the rank difference isgreater than ?2), we just output the top n aspects inthis list.
Otherwise, for those aspects whose rankspredicted by the linear regression models are not sig-nificantly lower than rn, we use the interaction rulesdiscovered in Section 5.3 to further adjust their rank-ing scores (i.e., increase the rank by ?2 if the clus-ter label is ?Important?, or decrease by ?2 if ?Not-Important?).
For each aspect, if more than one inter-action rule applies, more accurate rules take prece-dence over less accurate rules.
Finally, the systemwill output the top n aspects in the final list.We use an example shown in Figure 2 to illus-trate the cascade aspect selection process.
In thisexample, we assume n=3, ?1=1 and ?2=0.5.
We firstsorted all the aspects based on their values.
Sincethe values of ?Fuel Economy?
and ?Luxury?
are sig-nificantly better than the 3rd-ranked aspect ?Price?,their ranks are not affected by personalized aspectselection.
Similarly, since the values of ?Perfor-mance?
and ?Style?
are significantly lower than thatof the 3rd-ranked aspect, their ranks are also not af-fected by personalization.
Since the value differ-ences among the rest 4 aspects, ?Price?, ?Durabil-ity?, ?Quality?
and ?Safety?
are all equal or not sig-nificant worse than v3, we used trait-based person-alized ranks predicted by the regression models tore-rank them (the output ranks from the regressionmodels are shown in the parentheses in the column?Regression-based Re-Ranking?).
After re-rankingthese aspects based on the predicted ranks, since therank of the 3rd-ranked aspect ?Price?
(2.2) and thatof ?Safety?
(2.5) is within ?2, we use the learned1438Figure 2: A Cascade Content Selection Exampleinteraction rules to adjust their ranks.
Since the pre-dicted ranks of ?Durability?
and ?Quality?
are muchworse than that of ?Price?, their ranks are not af-fected by the interaction rules.
To apply the interac-tion rules, assume for a given receiver, both his ex-traversion and neuroticism scores are much higherthan the population average, the Safety-1, Quality-1 and Performance-1 rules are applicable.
Since theSafety-1 rule predicts that ?Safety?
is ?Important?
tothe receiver while none of the rules affects ?Price?,the predicted rank for ?Safety?
is increased by ?2.
After this adjustment, the ranks of all the aspectsare shown in the ?Final Rank?
column.
The top 3aspects based on the final ranks are selected as theoutput (those marked with a *).To evaluate the performance of the cascade con-tent selection model, we conducted an additionalAMT study.
Given the specifications of the ten carsin Task1, we asked each AMT participant to se-lect the top-n aspects to emphasize.
Here n=1 and3.
In this task, aspect selection not only dependson the importance of an aspect to a receiver, butalso the values of the aspects of a given car.
Wealso acquired the personality and value scores ofeach Turker based on the IPIP personality and PVQvalue survey.
Finally, we compared the output ofour model with the aspects selected by the Turkers.We used top-n overlapping percentage as the eval-uation metrics.
Overall, we collected the aspect se-lection results from 38 Turkers, each on ten differentcars.
In total, we collected 380 data instances in ourground truth dataset.
We have tested different ?1 and?2, the best results were obtained when ?1 = 0 and?2 = 0.5.
We compared our model with a baselinesystem which relies solely on the values of aspectsto determine their ranks in the baseline system.
Iftwo or more aspects have the same value (e.g., thevalues of both ?Price?
and ?Durability?
are ?3(Av-erage)?, their ranks were determined randomly.
Ta-ble 3 shows the evaluation results.
If only 1 aspect isneeded in the output, the Top-1 agreement is 62% forthe cascade model versus the baseline?s 54%.
Simi-larly, if 3 aspects are needed in the output, the Top-3agreement is 87% for the cascade model versus thebaseline?s 46%.
All the differences are statisticallysignificant based on paired-t test (p ?

preferences ofrestaurant features such as ?cuisine type?)
to a dif-ferent domain (e.g., a user?s preferences of moviefeatures such as ?movie genre?).
Although our datamodel is in the automobile domain, we adopted adomain-independent user model motivated by psy-chological theories(e.g., personality and basic hu-man values), instead of a domain-dependent userpreference models (e.g, a user?s preferences of ?fueleconomy?).
This allows us to more easily apply typ-ical domain adaptation methods such as instance-based (Zadrozny, 2004) or feature-based transferlearning (Blitzer et al, 2006) to further adapt thesystem and generalize the current results.8 ConclusionsIn this study, we analyzed the relationship betweenan individual?s traits and his/her aspect framing de-cisions.
Our analysis has uncovered interesting pat-terns that can be used to automatically customizea message?s content to enhance its appeal to its re-ceivers.
We also proposed a cascade content selec-tion model to automatically incorporate the analysisresults in automated persuasive message generation.Our evaluation results have demonstrated the effec-tiveness of this approach.1439ReferencesKristen D Anderson.
