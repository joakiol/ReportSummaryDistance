The BICORD SystemCombining Lexical Information from Bilingual Corporaand Machine Readable Dictionaries ~Judith Klavans Evelyne TzoukcrmannIBM T.J. Watson Research A.T. & T., Bell Laboratories,Yorktown Heights, N.Y. 10532 Murray tlill, New Jersey 07974ABSTRACTOur goal is to explore methods for combiningstructured but incomplete information from dic-tionaries with the unstructured but more completeinformation available in corpora for the creation ofa bilingual lexical data base.
This paper concen-trates on the class of action verbs of movement, andbuilds on earlier work on lexical correspondencesbetween languages and specific to this verb class.The languages we explore here are English andFrench.
We first examine the way prototypicalverbs of movement are translated in the Collins-Robert (Collins 1978, henceforth CR) bilingualdictionary.
We then analyze the behavior of someof these verbs in a large bilingual corpus.
We takeadvantage of the results of linguistic research onverb types (e.g.
Levin, to appear) coupled with datafrom machine readable dictionaries to motivatecorpus-based text analysis for the purpose of estab-fishing lexical correspondences with the full rangeof associated translations and then attach frequen-cies to translations.1.
Background.
As NLP systems become more ro-bust, large lexicons are required, providing a widerange of information including syntactic, semantic,pragmatic, naorphological nd phonological.
Thereare difficulties in constructing these large lexicons,first in their design, and then in providing them withthe necessary and sufficient data.
These problemshave recently been the topic of intense research(Klavans 1988, Boguraev and  Briscoe 1989,Boguraev et al 1989, Zemick 1990).
Moreover, animportant sub-area of computational lexicon build-ing that has barely been approached is that of bi-lingual lexicon construction (Caholari and Picchi1986, Rizk 1989).2.
Motion Verbs.
In this paper, we report on datafor movement verbs (or motion verbs).
The classof English motion verbs and their translations intoRomance languages has been widely discussed fromvarious points of view including theoretical, struc-tural (Talmy 1985), and applied (Atkins et al 1990,in preparation).
English generally incorporatesmovement and cause or manner into a single lexicalitem whereas languages like French do not.
Forexample, in CR stroll is translated as %6 promenernonchalamment', 'fl/mer' and stroll in/out etc.
as'entrer/sortir/s'floigner sans se presser' or'nonchalammcnt'.
Notice that in French, thetranslation typically consists of a general motionverb 'entrer/sortir/aUer/avancer' with an adverbialor prepositional modifier showin\[, manner, e.g.
'nonchalammcnt' or 'sans se presser'.
Similarly, inEnglish, causation in movement is often incorpo-rated, e.g the Fmglish verb march as in to march thetroops is translated in CR as 'faire marcher (au pas)les troupes'.
These multi-word correspondencesoften cause problcms in the lexical transfer compo-nent of machine translation systems.3.
Bilingual Corpus-based Analysis.
In earlier work(Klavans and Tzoukermann 1989), we reported ona study of a scleclcd sub-set of movement verbs haa bilingual corpus.
The corpus consists of 85million English and 95 million French words fromthe Canadian Parliamentary Proceedings (thettansard corpus).
Of this, 75 million French and70 milfion I;nglish words are aligned by sentence(Brown ctal.
1988).
For example:SENTENCE ~: 3S7748The a .~,assador ' s  con~r lbu~ionwas  one smal lpar ly  a~ which  a r'mu~er of  us ended updanc ing  on a lab le .L 'appor~ de l 'ambassadeur  s 'es~ resumea une pet i te  f ;~e  ou nous avons  f in ipar  danser  sup une tab le .F igure  One : Sample Ci~a l ionSome rcprescntalive verbs which have at least onemovement sense were selected.
We compared theextent of the information found in the bilingualcorpus with the information found in the CRmachine-readable dictionary (MRD).
For verbs likecommute which do not have a straightforwardtranslation, we found either (I) all the componentsof the verb concept, as in 'se rendre au travailquotidiennement'; (2) parts of the translation, as in'faire le trajet'; or (3) a totally different verb fromthat given in the MRD, such as 'parcourir' or'voyager'.Wc observed that, not only was the MRDinformalion incomplete, but also only a partial ex-This work was completed at IBM, T.J.

In the past, since printed dictionarieshave been subject to the constraints of time andspace, they have not always been able to offer fullinformation about entries, ltowever, with electronicdictionaries and lexical data bases, this should nolonger be a restriction.
In fact, given more andricher information, we envision a move away fromthe flat tfierarchieal structure of dictionaries to amore network-like representation f lexical know-ledge.4.
Rclate~l R~earch.
Combining linguistic and sta-tistical methods is becoming increasingly popular incomputational linguistics especially as more corporabecome available.
2 Work in this vein ranges fromthe syntactic and semantic to the lexical.
For ex-ample, Atkins 1987 demonstrates convincingly thatwith corpus data, the lexicographer can attack thedifficult problem of word senses in a systematic way.Church and ttanks 1989 and Church et al 1990develop a battery of statistical methods to inducelinguistic regularities.
They identify coocurrencerelations by computing statistics (e.g.
by use ofmutual information, t-score) over millions of wordsof text.
Their approach is focussed on monolingualrather than bilingual corpus analysis, and constitutesa significant contribution to lexical research.
Onmore syntactic note, Dagan and Itai 1990 use sta-tistical methods over linguistically parsed text(Jensen 1986) to resolve anaphorie reference.In the arena of automatic bilingual lexiconconstruction, Catizone el: al.
1989 take two corre-sponding texts (English and German) and developaigoritluns to deternffne l xical alignments by usingstatistical methods over texts combined with theoptional support of an MRD.
In contrast, Sadler1989 proposes parsing aligned corpora into depend-ency trees, which form the structures upon whichlexieal correspondences are suggested to the user.The early stages of the construction of the BilingualKnowledge Base (BKB) rely heavily on human in-put but gradually becomes more automatic as datais collected.
Using purely statistical techniques,Brown et al 1988 make use of the Itansard bilingualcorpus for the purpose of building a machine trans-lation system.
Such a system is a good example ofusing exclusively statistical non-linguistic methodsto induce translations.5.
The B ICORD System - Bilingual Corpus-basedDictionary.
Our approach involves a combinationof standard linguistic methodology using MRD's,enhanced with some statistical techniques.
Dic-tionaries are often discounted because they are builton basis of introspective intuition rather than purelyon objective observation of data.
ttowever, ourunderlying assumption is that the insights that adictkmary encodes and represents hould not bedisregarded (although there are some limitations re-suiting from the structural organisation).
\]'his is acontroversial ssumption.
Even though, in the past,dictionaries havc been built solely on the basis ofintuition, current trends are to use corpus-drivencriteria, as, for example, in the Collins COBUILDdictionary (1987).
Without question tiffs is a stepin the riglat direction towards completness and ac-curacy of coverage of the language as it actually oc-curs.
Itowever, the limitation of corpus analysis isthat subtle linguistic inluitions about word behavior(such as "negative vidence") cannot be obtainedfrom corpora; in other words, what is disallowed inthe language may never be discovered.
Tiros wedisagree with the claim of Garside, Leech, andSampson 1987 that the survival of both descriptiveand theoretical computational linguistics lies prima-rily in statistical analysis.
We take the more mod-erate view that both approaches (linguistic andstatistical) are essential if the language is to becharacterized accurately and in its entirety.We extracted occurrences of several move-ment verbs (called "probe" strings) from the Englishside of the I lansard corpus.
The criteria used toensure that the verb was a member of tiffs semanticclass is described in Atkins, Boguraev and Klavans1990 (in preparation).
The test set of verbs wasdrift, dance, commute, emigrate, immigrate, ascend,descend, circle, sail and glide.
The probe string wasused to search in CR; both for translations andcollocations under the entry itself, and also forFrench headwords in the French side of the dic-tionary with the probe as a translation.
The ex-tracted corpora, consisting of the set of Englishcitations containing the probe string (ha anymorphological shape) and the corresponding Frenchsentence, is called a "probe corpus".
A statisticaltagger (Tzoukermann and Merialdo 1989) was usedto assign a part of speech to the English side of thecorpora.
Translations and collocations were ab-stracted automatically from the parsed version ofCR (see Neff and Boguraev 1989) using LQL (Neffet al 1988).
For illustration, a partial entry fordance is:+-bdw: dance+-superhom+-Im~og~aph+-homr.Jm: 2+-pos : v~+-Iransla~I +-argxJlm~r1~:: leal~z e~cI +-+*ord: danserJ .

Probes had a maximumof 1 t46 citations, with a maximum of 25 senses andcollocations in CR (a rough measure of polysemy).The tagger used to preprocess the corpus wastrained on 1 million words (about 42,000 sentences)tagged manually and provided by the tree bank ofLancaster University (Garside, Leech, and Sampson1987).
Our version has 81 tags, a subset of the treebank tags.
Of these tags, 52 are categorial (such asVV+I for infmitival form of a non-auxiliary verb)and 29 are lexically bound, some of the latter beingbound to a class of one (e.g.
I0' is for the preposi-tion of), and some are bound to a small sub-classof category (such as PP*S for "personal pronounsubject").
Some tags (such as N+I "singular noun")provide morphological information, as well as cate-gorial.
The program, based on a tfigram model,computes the probability of a word in relation to itstag and assigns the tag that corresponds to thehighest likelihood.
In its simplest form:p(TIH) = p(HIT I  m p iT )that is, the probability of a tag given its word cor-responds to the product of the probability of ob-serving the word given its tag by the probability ofobserving the tag.
By random sampling, we deter-mined the error rate for part of speech tagging tobe about 3%.In this way, examples of sample strings as averb were separated from the nominal uses.
This isthe first step in disambiguation, enabling lexicalcorrespondences.
To give an idea of size, there were293 citations (about 12,000 words) with the stringdance in its four morphological forms in English.The distribution by part of speech for these citationsis:Category  Citations ZVERB 109 37NOUN 174 59AOJ 10 3The distribution varies by probe; for example, ofthe 34024 citations for the string "move" (and itsvariants), 26218 usages were labelled as verbs(77%), 7412 as nouns (22%), and 394 (11%) asadjectival.

Citations that have lexicalcorrespondences already provided by the machine-readable dictionary are extracted from the probecorpus.
For example, consider again the verbdance.
Thc character strings in the translation andcollocation fields are extracted from CR; thesestrings arc filtered to remove function words andsome common words (such as 'faire' (to make ordo), morphological variants are generated.
Someexamples for dance are 'danser/dansa/dansera ...,gambader/gambadont .... ' Probe translations andcollocations from CR are then ready to be used toautomatically match stmlgs in the French side of thecorpus.
Each correspondence that matches one ofthe MRD probes is removed from the probe corpus,stored, and counted, leaving a reduced probe cor-pus.
For example, for 109 citations of dance as averb, 52 sentences matched the MRD correspond-ences, as shown in Figure One.
An extended lexi-con can then be built, using the structure alreadyprovided by CR where the frequencies are com-puted over these matches.
For example, an initialpartial enhanced entry for dance is:+-hda: dance?-superhomI .

For example, an ad-ditional node is added to the MRD structure to in-sort danser since danser is a translation both inhomograph 2 and in homograph 3.
Since transitiv-ity of a verb cannot be determined automatically,there is no evidence to rnotivate placement so thedata is inserted high in the tree, at the homographlevel.
In contrast, 'gambader' and 'sautiUer' m'e al-ways intransitive (as determined by a look-up inCR), so they can be automatically placed underhomograph three.
Notice also that corpus derivedinformation is placed under the relevant d_collocat|or 'gambadcr' and 'sautiller' since these are caseswhere matches occun'ed on the target erm, but thesource is different.The \]lansard, being the Canadian Parliamen-tary proceedings, contains a number of juridical andparliamentary terms, usages, and structures, a typi-cal feature of any sublanguage.
However the tlexi~bility inherent in the BICORD system woukt allowa repetition of the sarne process over different sub..languages.
As other texts are used, frequencies canbe updaled in two ways, by counting all tiequenciesinto a general score, and also by keeping separateli'equencies linked to the source text.
This featureallows a representation of the lexical correspond-ences of general and specific texts in one data strucolure.
It also permits comparison betweensublanguages.
The result would be a balanced lexiocon built over a balanced variety of corpora to re-|lect the actual uses of the words or phrases incontext.Further analysis of the remaining probe cor-pus is pursued by observing cooccurences both overtags and lexical items.
For example, with dance,looking at immediate right context over tags revealsverb-prep atterns:VERB CATEGORY %clarke pr~p 77darme ot l -mr 22Moving from tag cooecurences to  lexical items, themajority of these cases are for the preposition to.Including coocurrences over a larger window of fivewords, idioms are revealed like dance to ... tune,which is not found in CR, either under tune ordance.
These and other patterns cma be discoveredby statistical analysis over tags and lexical items it\]the reduced probe corpora.
Therefore, a new set ofcollocations can be inserted in the lexicon; an entryfor "dance" enhanced furl.her is shown as follows:+-h<~.

,conversely, to enhance a statistical system with datafrom an Mill.).
The first application can be viewedin the light of a lexicographer's workstation; it canalso be viewed as a contribution to the choice oflexical item made by the component responsible forlexical transfcr in a machine translation system.Translations and collocations in the original MRDare ordered by frequency, orderings which can easilybe updated depending on the sub-language corpus.The enhanced MRD is more complete in containingcorrespondences not found in the original diction-ary, and in suggesting new statistically significanttranslations.
As for the second type of application,systems such as described in Brown et al 1988which use purely statistical approaches to infertranslations from a bilingual corpus can benefit di~rectly from the information already given in theMRD.
This information can be used to preset val-ues in the computation of correspondences, ratherthan letting the system learn values "already discov-ered.Future work depends on testing these twoapplications, namely that MRD-based lexieal trans-fer will proceed more accurately given statistical in-formation and that statistical implementations,given enhanced Mi l l )  data, will demonstrate im-proved perlormance in determining lexical corre-spondences.Acknowledgements: We thank members of the SpeechRecognition (;roup at IBM for cleaning and maintainingthe I lansard corpus.
In particular, we acknowledge helpfrom Bernard Merialdo.ReferencesFigure Four: Fuller Enhar~ed EntryIt is not always the case that the remaining corpusdata can be easily inserted in the lexicon and in fact,we encountered a few problems during this process.First, it is not straightforward to ~aow with whichfield to associate the resulting correspondences.
Forexample, in dance, does dance around go under aseparate translation field or is it related to thecollocation field with dance about?
Second, somenew context fields should be added to thecollocation nodes, but determining the criteria tbrselecting them automatically is not always evident.Further, there is a question of locating and inte-grating robust new data from the corpus into thealready existing structure.6.
