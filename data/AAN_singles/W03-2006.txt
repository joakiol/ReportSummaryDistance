UKa.althubaity@surrey.ac.ukAbstractA corpus -based diachronic analysis ofpatent documents, based mainly on themorphologically productive use of certainterms can help in tracking the evolution ofkey developments in a rapidly e volvingspecialist field.
The patent texts were o b-tained from the US Patent & Trade MarksOffice?s on-line service and the termswere extracted automatically from thetexts.
The chosen specialist field was thatof fast-switching devices and systems.The method presented draws from liter a-ture on biblio - and sciento -metrics, infor-mation extraction, corpus linguistics, andon aspects of English morphology.
Thisinterdisciplinary fram ework shows thatthe evolution of word -formation closelyshadows the developments in a field oftechnology.IntroductionA patent document is written to pe rsuade a techno-legal authority that the patentee should be allowedto manufacture, sell, or deal in an article to the ex-clusion of other persons.
The article is typ icallybased on an invention that the patentee(s) claimhas been theirs.
The term article  is important inthat it refers to a tangible object and its u sage is toemphasise that ideas, intangibles essentially, ca n-not be patented.
Patent documents are the repos i-tory of how technology advances and, moreimportantly, show how language supports thechange.The techno-legal authority requires the patentdocument to follow a template.
This template isdivided broadly into two parts: first, legal te m-plates comprising pate ntee?s details, juri sdictionalscope, and related item; second, technicaltemplates divided into a summary of the patentee?sclaims, relation of the article to previously patentedarticles ?
the so-called prior art  ?
and the scien-tific/technical basis of t he claim.
The scientificclaim is written in a language that is similar to thelanguage of journal p apers.One important task that is slowly emerging isthe extent to which the analysis of a patent doc u-ment can be automated particularly to a ssess theoverlap between the claims in the document aboutthe article to be patented with that of related, rel e-vant and even counter -claims about the article.The related and rel evant claims and counter claimsmay be found in existing patent documents andmay, more in directly, exist in journal papers.A patent document has to make references toall other relevant/related articles that have beenpatented prior to the invention of the art icle, whichis yet to be patented and is the object of the patentdocument.
The ref erences are made primarily byciting the name of the prior art patentees and thetitles of their patent documents.
A patent doc u-ment also has other linguistic descriptions of priorart; such descriptions are reminiscent of citationsof journal papers in a  journal paper.
The overlap ofa new patent document with a set of existing patentdocuments may suggest the impact of extantknowledge in patent documents on emergingknowledge in the new patent document.
Such anoverlap has been studied by the impact of  USsemiconductor technology on the rest of the world(Appleyard and Kalsow: 1999): this overlap relieslargely on the fr equency of citation of a US patentby the name of its author or the author?s place ofwork.
In computational linguistic (CL) terms thi sexercise relies on proper noun extra ction.The patent document relates to an explicit andexclusive right over an intellectual property.
Ajournal article relates to an implicit and i nclusiveright over an intellectual property.
The overlapbetween these two forms of claims is crucial notonly in ascertaining the rights of the patentee, orthe abuse of the rights of others by the pa tentee,but also for monitoring the effectiveness of r e-search based on a specialism as a whole or that ofits component gro ups.The effect of one author or a group of authorsworking in an institution is indirectly mea sured bythe so-called impact factor .
This factor relates tothe frequency of citation of one or more journalpapers written by an author or by a group.
Thecalculation of the impact fa ctor relies mainly oncomputing the frequency of the authors?
name(s)within a corpus of journal articles.
Such an impactfactor type calculation is used typically in bibl i-ometrics (Garfield 1995).
Again, as in intra -patentimpact studies mentioned above, in CL terms thisis an exercise in proper noun identification andextraction.The analysis of a patent document, togetherwith the analysis of the related corpora of otherpatent documents and intellectual property doc u-ments, should be based on a framework whichprovides methods and tec hniques for analysing thecontents of the document and of the corpora.
Forus the source of a framework still lies in li nguisticand language studies.
Here we are pa rticularlyinterested in word formation and terminology u s-age in highly specialised  disc iplines particularlythose disciplines that deal with inta ngible articlescoupling the word formation and terminology u s-age with the citation patterns of proper nounsbrings us closer to analysing the contents of a pat-ent document and its siblings distributed over co r-pora.Information scientists usually use the referen c-ing data of research documents to analyse know l-edge evolution in scientific fields as well as toidentify the key authors, institutes , and journals inspecific domains, using tools such as publicationcounts, citation analysis, co -citation analysis, andco-term analysis to do so.
In recent years, patentdocuments have gained considerable attention as avaluable resource that can be use d to analyse tec h-nology advances using the same tools.Gupta and Pangannaya (2000) have appliedbibliometric analysis to carbon nanotube patents tomeasure the growth of activity of carbon nan otubeindustries and their links with sc ience.
They havealso used patents data to study the country -wisedistribution of patenting activity for the USA, J a-pan, and other countries.
Sector -wise performancesof industry, academia and government, and theactive players of carbon nanotubes were also stu d-ied.
They describe the nature of inventions takingplace in this particular field of technology, and theauthors claim to have identified the emerging r e-search directions, and the active companies andresearch groups involved.Meyer (2001) has used citation anal ysisand co-word analysis of patent documents and sc i-entific literature to explore the interrel ationshipbetween nano-science and nano -technology.
Meyerinvestigated patent citation relations at the orga n-izational levels along with geographical locationsand affiliations of inventors and a uthors.
The termco-occurrence  is used by Meyer to find the rel a-tionship between the patent documents and the twoscientific literature databases SCI and INSPEC.
Hehas noticed that ?
?the terms that occur frequentlyin the document titles of all databases are related to[?]
instrumentalities and/or are located in fieldsthat are generally associated with substantial indu s-trial research activity?
(2001:177).
Meyer has a r-gued that ?Our data suggests that nano -technologyand nano-science are essentially separate and he t-erogeneous, yet interrelated cumulative stru ctures?
(2001:164).The study of word formation through n e-ologisms within the special language of scienceand techno logy has led some authors to argue thatit is the scientists as technologists who attempt torationalise our experience of the world around usin written language by using new words or formsor by relexicalising the existing stock (see Ahmad2000 for relevant references).
Some lexicogr a-phers (see for example Quirk et al 1985) have su g-gested that neologisms can be formed by twoprocesses:  First, the addition or combination ofelements such as compounding: Resonant Tunne l-ing Diodes  and Scanning tunneling microscopy  areexamples for this type of neologism (compoundin gas a neologism formation is used extensively inscience and technology literature); Second, the r e-duction of elements into abbreviated forms.
Theabbreviations FET (Field E ffect Transistor) andMOSFET (Metallic Oxide Semiconductor FET)are examples of this type.Neologisms appear to signal the eme rgence ofnew concepts or artefacts and the frequency of thisnew word might indicate the scientific comm u-nity?s acceptance of this new concept or artefact.Effenberger (1995) has argued that ??
the faster asubject field is developing, the more novelties areconstructed, discovered or created.
And these no v-elties are talked and written about.
In o rder tomake this technical communication as efficient aspossible, provision should be made for avoidingmisunderstanding.
One crucial point in this processis the vocabulary that is being used?
(1995:131,emphasis added).In this paper we discuss the idiosyncratic la n-guage used in patent documents.
The language isreplete with terms and there are instances within apatent document that suggest that the authors notonly use the specialist terms but use a local syntaxas well.
We look specifically at the structure of theUS Patents and suggest how with existing tec h-niques used in information extraction and NLP,including term extraction and proper noun identif i-cation, one can perform fairly complex tasks inpatent analysis ?
some of which are performed bypatent experts by hand currently (Section 2).
Thisexamination suggests to us a model of develo p-ment in computer and  semi -conductor technology:an incremental model where each subsequent pa t-ent helps in the development of ever -complex art i-facts ?
starting from devices onto circuits and ontosystems.
We will look at one of the key i nventionsin the field of semiconducto rs physics ?
the elec-tron tunneling device .
These devices co mbinetechnical elegance, experimental complexity andmanufacturing challenge.
Due to its strategic i m-portance, a number of patents have been o btainedby the US government and also by a nu mber of USand Japanese companies (Section 3).
Section 4concludes this paper.The Structure of US PTO Doc umentsand a Local Grammar for the Docu-mentsThe USPTO database is a representative sa mple ofpatent documents.
The USPTO has documents r e-lated to most bra nches of science and technology.It includes information about all US patent doc u-ments since the first pa tent issued in 1970 to themost recent.
The USPTO database a llows the userto search the full text of the patent documents for acertain word or a co mbination of words.
It alsoprovides a field search for specific informationsuch as inventor or assignee .
The search can alsobe conducted for a sp ecific year or range of years.The US Patents are written partly as a legal textand partly as a scientific d ocument.
Over the last50 years or so, it appears that US Patent doc umentshave been structured in terms of layout and have asuperficial resemblance to Marvin Minsky?sframe-like knowledge represe ntation schema.The patent document can be divided intothree main parts for the present discussion: Thefirst part  comprises the biographical details of theinventors (and their employers) together with thetitle of the invention and a brief free -text abstract,dates when the patent was applied for and whenthe patent was granted and so on.
The free text isessentially a summary of the claims of the pa t-entee; The second part  contains external refe rencesof three sorts: the first sort is the specialist domainof the invention ?
the subject class indica ting thesuper-ordinate class and instances; the se cond sortare other cited patents organised as a 4 -tuple: (i)patent number, (ii) date of approval, (iii) first i n-ventor and (iv) classification number; and, the thirdsort is a bibliographic reference to public ations thatmay have contributed to the pa tent;  The third partof a current US Patent document co mprises?claims?
related to the patent and the d escription ofthe ?invention?
(there are diagrams of the inve ntionattached to the document and the diagrams d e-scribed in the text).
Table 1 on the next page showsthe template of the current (c. 1980 and a fter)USPTO?s.The ?claims?
of the patentees are clearlyitemised and initialised by the number of the claim;the first claim is the basis of the patent abstractgenerally.
The ?background to the invention?
iswritten in an idiosyncratic fashion as well ?
theinvention is first contextualised in a broader groupof other inventions to date and then the specificnature of the invention is e xemplified.
Thebroader and the specific are usually marked byphrases like ?The (present) invention relates to?and the specificity is phrased as ?
(more) specif i-cally.?
or ?
(more) pa rticularly?.
These phrases arefollowed by one or more noun phrases connectedwith, for example, c onjunctions or qualifiers.
Thefirst noun phrase names the article i nvented, forinstance, a name of a new device, circuit or a fabr i-cating or testing pro cess.FIELD VALUEUnited States Patent Number  NUMBERFirst Inventor  PROPER NOUN ET AL.Date Patent Approved  DATETitle: FREE TEXTAbstract:  FREE TEXTInventors:  PROPER NOUNSAssignee: PROPER NOUNSApplication No.

To illu strate this point we havelooked at a recent randomly selected patent onmemory devices  ?
a patent filed by Kabushiki Ka i-sha Toshiba  of Japan (or Toshiba for short), andapproved by USPTO on 20 th May 2003, on a sem i-conductor memory device which uses the emergentnotion of memory cells (a memory cell is  a tinyarea within the memory array tha t actually storesthe bit in the form of an electrical charge 1).

Toshiba?s USPTO6567330 refers to 8 other patents.
The details ofthe referenced patents are in a 4 -tuple, which canbe unambiguously interpreted.
Each  of the refe r-enced patents refers to about 10 patents in turn.An examination of 82 such patents may help toinitiate, perhaps, a discussion of the ?invention lifecycle?

6567330 (T o-shiba Japan) shows the major influence of US -based assignees, followed by Japan.
A significantnumber of patents  (8.5%) are held by individualsand not assigned specif ically to a country.A semi-automatic analysis of terms used inthe Abstracts and Titles of the patents (Toshiba6567330 and patents referenced in the Toshibapatents) shows the co -citation pattern o f terms.This may help in the clu stering of patents on thebasis of terms extracted from the patent doc umentsas well as novel terms (terms not included in theUSPTO Patent Class ification terminology database) found in the doc ument.
We show the co -citation of the two key terms memory cell  andmemory device in the nine patents discussed above.The use of the two terms individually and as rootsand stems of other compounds is also shown.
Themore frequent citation is to the newer term memorycell and it is cited in all but one of the 9 relatedpatents.

is less fre-quently used and it is only found in the abstracts of5 out of the 9 patents.
Both terms are co -cited in 6out of the 9  patents (see Table 5 for details).The interrelationship between the differentpatents can be explored further by examiningclosely as to what is being patented within the pa t-ent and what is being patented in the referencedpatents.
Again, we use the e xample of the Toshibapatent No.
6567330 which refers to 8 other patents.The patent itself relates to the invention of a sys-tem.
The referred patents relate to other systemsand circuits.
Let us look at the earliest patent citedin Toshiba?s patent: th is is US PTO No.

The title of I ntel?s patent is ?
Singlecell reference scheme for flash memory sensingand program state verific ation?.
Flash memory isdefined as ?A nonvolatile programma ble semicon-ductor memory product  2.
This patent r elates to theinvention of a circuit.
Intel?s patent comprises re f-erences to another 15 patents: 5 refer to other sy s-tems, 8 to ci rcuits, and one each to a device and asoftware program (see Figure 1 on th e next page).The information whether a patent is r elated to anyof the four classes can be gleaned from the PatentClassification Number.
Further analysis of thereferenced patents shows a similar pattern ?
refe r-ences to circuits, devices, systems and s oftware.This appears to be a basis of the inventions withinthe semiconductor industry, especially those r e-lated to the development of co mputer systemsbased on these systems, d evices and circuits.

systems, circuits and devices .3 The Evolution of the ResonantTunneling DevicesWe will now focus on how terminology u sage mayhelp in tracking the evolution of resonant tunne l-ing devices.
These are ultra high -speed devices,which perhaps will be used in the compute rs of thenext decade or so.
In order to study how one cantrack technology progress we have adopted an i n-tuitive, but realistic, framework.
For us, all co m-plex systems comprise subsystems and subsystemsare made up of much smaller (and simpler) de-vices.
A computer system is made up of i ntegratedcircuits and the circuits made up of transistors andtransistors come in di fferent types.
One model ofgrowth can be thought of as follows: First, devicesare patented, then su bsystems, and finally thecomplex systems (remember only tangible articlescan be patented).
So fo llowing this intuitiveframework we will first see a number of devicesbeing patented then subsystems and finally the sy s-tems themselves.
Tunnel diodes are supposed toempower faster switching devices, which in turnhave to be incorporated into subsystems with tu n-neling transistors and into complex systems withcircuits.
Our hypothesis is that an analysis of adiachronically organized text corpus will show theworking of the above -mentioned framework.A corpus was built containing more than2.2 million words of patent documents.
The co r-pus contains all patent documents that co ntain theterm tunneling  in the title.
USPTO search r esultsshowed that there are 372 titles, approved from1975 to 1999 in semiconductor physics.
We haveanalysed frequency of compound word in theUSPTO patent documents published b etween1975-1999 (Table 6).75-79 80-84 85-89 90-94 95-99No.ofTexts7 8 68 133 156Total No.of tokens43812 43262 378272 771525 995894Table 6.
The diachronic breakdown of patentscomprising at least one instance of the token tun-neling over 5 year intervals between 1975 -1999.The compound word analysis was co n-ducted using System Quirk and no compoundswere pre spec ified (System Quirk a text analysissystem, is avai lable onwww.computing.surrey.ac.uk/ai/SystemQ ).
Thesystem extracts compound words based on a si m-ple heuristic: a set of word that does not co ntainclosed class words (i.e.
determiners, conjun ctions,prepositions, and moderators) or the orthographicsigns (including pun ctuation, numbers, currencyand other symbols) is considered by Sy stem Quirkto be a compound word (see Ahmad and Rogers,2001, for details).
The va lidation of compoundwords can also be carried out by statistical tests,for instance described by Smajda (1994).To investigate the progress of resonanttunneling devices and circuits, the multi -wordterms were extracted from the USPTO full textcorpus using System Quirk.
The extracted termsthat relate to resonant tu nneling diodes, resonanttunneling transistors and resonant tunneling ci r-cuits were arranged in a five year interval startingfrom the first emergence of the term resonant tun-neling in USPTO abstract documents in 1985.Tracking the frequency usage of the termsassociated with resonant tunneling artefacts in theUSPTO full text corpus shows a considerable i n-crease of frequency usage i nterval by interval.
Thefrequency of the term resonant tunneling diode(and its plural form resonant tunneling diode s,both denoted as the lemma resonant tunneling d i-ode~ subsequently) increased significantly from 45in 1985-1989 to 446 in 1990 -1994  by about a fa c-tor of 19 and then in the next time interval 1995 -1999 the frequency dropped by about half to 240.The frequency usage of the term resonant tunne l-ing transistor~  in the USPTO full text corpus i n-creased from 23 in the p eriod 1985-1989 by abouta factor of 10 to 225 in 1990 -1994.
The increase offrequency usage of the term in the time period1995-1999 increased by a factor of 1.3 to become293.
The term resonant tunne ling circuit~ appearsin the USPTO full text co rpus 45 times in the timeinterval 1990 -1994.
Frequency usage of resonanttunneling circuits inc reased by a fa ctor of 1.3 in thenext interval (1995 -1999) to 57.Word formation is not restricted to the i n-flection of a compound word.
Rather, we see fu r-ther instances of compounding where an existingcompound, say, resonant tunneling d i-ode/transistor  is  used as a head of other co m-pounds (Table 7).1990-1994 1995-1999barrier resonant tunne l-ing diodetriple barrier resonanttunneling diodeband resonant tunne lingtransistor~bipolar quantum reso-nant tunneling transi s-torTable 7.
The specialization, t hrough prefixation,of the term resonant tunneling d iode & transistorover a 10 year period in our patent corpusWe note the very productive use of compoun dingand inflection in our corpus.
Note, ho wever, thatthe size of the corpus for the three differe nt peri-ods, 1985 -89, 90-94 and 95-99, are different:378272, 771525 and 995894 respectively.
Thesize of the corpus perhaps for the later two p eriodsis roughly the same but the earlier corpus (85 -89)is three times smaller.
In order to pr esent a bettercomparison we will look at the relative frequencyof the compounds in that we will sum up the fr e-quency of all the extracted compounds related toresonant tunneling diodes, transistors and circuits,as per our intuitive fram ework, and assign relativefrequency to each of the three relative to the sum.Consider the result of analysis of 133 textsof patents published in 1990 -1994 for tunnel dioderelated patents.
The total number of terms co m-prising the lemma resonant tunneling diode~ is490, which includes  the lemma on its own and twoterms containing the lemma as the headword; theseare multiple peak resonant tunne ling diode, barrierresonant tunneling d iode.
The total containing thelemma resonant tunneling transistor  is 225, whichis made up of 188 for the lemma on its own and therest for the two other terms.
The lemma RT circuitalso includes hyponyms of the term, e.g.
RT oscil-lator (circuit), RT  logic gate (circuit)  and RT mem-ory (circuit) ; note that the term circuit is shown inparentheses as it is ellipsed in the text ?
the readerof the patents, an expert in the disc ipline, isexpected to know that an oscillator is a circuit.The two terms occur 24 and 12 times t ogether with4 other terms that collectively occur 9 times ma k-ing a total of 45.
The three lemmas RT diode,transistor and circuit occur for a total of 490 + 225+ 45 (= 760) times, hence the relative fr equency ofthe three lemmas is 64.4% (490/760), 29.6%(225/760) and 6% (45/760) respectively (Table 8shows a brea kdown of the distributio n).This relative frequency computation wasconducted over the periods 1985 -1989 and 1995 -1999.
Table 9 (on the next page) shows that over64% of the terms belong to the lemma resonanttunneling diode ~, about 30 % to resonant tunne lingtransistor and just about 6% to  resonant tu nnelingcircuit ~.

The growth of compound terms compri s-ing the headwords diode & diodes denoted collec-tively as diode~, transistor~ , and circuit~, togetherwith the stem resonant tunneling (RT).4 AfterwordIt appears that there is a local grammar , compris-ing vocabulary of t he specialist domain and a sy n-tax that appears different from the general(universal?)
syntax, used in framing the claims,background and su mmary of the invention in a USPatent document.
A number of slots in the USPTO document are reserved for proper na mes ?patentees, assignees, places of work, and otherslots hold dates and all these slots show the e x-tremes of the local grammar ?
essentially a gra m-mar for a one-word language.
The documentcomprises ?references to (other patents) and alsocitations to an extant by other later patents ?
thisinformation is encoded in another local grammarof one or more 4 -tuples referring to a referencedpatent ?
the 4-tuple has a clearly defined s equenceand allows expressions only in terms of four noun -phrases.
The referenced patent number is an activehyperlink through which the details of the refe r-enced patent can be a ccessed and subsequently achain of references can be established in a (semi -)automatic manner.
The existence of a local gra m-mar and the hyperlinks s uggests to us that one cancreate a historic (diachronic) description of aninvention together with the crucial account of theinfluence of other inventions.Restricted syntax is used, for example, indescribing time (hours, minutes, seconds, days,years, months), in financial news wire as well asmission-critical communication.
The sp ecialistvocabulary, and more so the productive use of thevocabulary (see below for details), as well as therestricted syntax emerges initially for assuring a m-biguity-free communication in an inherent noisymedium of communication ?
natural language.Complementary to the emergence of thepresent US patent document, there has been an a c-cumulation of terminological knowledge in termsof the repositories usually referred to  as patentclassification .
The Patent Offices around theworld classify all manners of ?art icles?
rangingfrom micro -electronics to kitchen utensils and fromsoftware systems to heavy excavation machinery,for example.
Much like a number of other utilita r-ian class ification systems, including the DeweyDecimal Classification on the one hand and the USNational Library of Medicine?s Disease Classific a-tion system on the other, the US PTO classificationsystem is detailed, complex, full of cross refe r-ences, and occasionally confusing.
The fact r e-mains, however, that like all utilita rian systems, theUS PTO classification system is a rich repositorythat can be used, with some alterations, as the lex i-cal/terminological resource for information extra c-tion in particular and NLP in general.
Therepository states the ontological commitment of theUS PTO and its advisers, and can be used forbuilding knowledge representation schema or s e-mantic processing sy stems.The appearance of a local grammar, orperhaps local grammars, used to frame a patentdocument together with an extensive terminologydatabase of patent class ification, is good news forthe patent processing comm unity.
There is somehope that the information extraction and NLP sy s-tems will be able to extrac t the terminology andidentify the idiosyncratic syntax that governs thedifferent parts of the patent document with the helpof techniques pioneered in corpus linguistics.Terminology extraction can be facilitated by refe r-ring to the patent classific ation terminology baseand facilitated by various statistical and linguisti ctechniques used to identify complex noun -phrasesin specialist texts.
Once the local grammar is ide n-tified it will be able to meaningfully process thedocuments for inferring the imp ort of a given i n-vention in relation to other inventions and to assessthe impact of journal publications of inventions.And, indeed all manner of new ways of examininga patent document may open up once the investig a-tor overcomes the burden of sifting th rough anovergrowing lexical mountain of new patents, rev i-sions to exis ting patents and the scientific andtechnical publication juggernaut that adds more tothe mountain on almost daily basis.
The aut omaticextraction of compounds from a corpus of patentdocuments appears to show the introduction ofnew artifacts through the use of morphologicalprocesses like word formations.
Cu rrently, ourwork in progress is to ?chart?
a transfer of suchterms in journal papers onto patents, in a ddition tothe exercise reported which charts the transfer ofterms within a diachronically organised corpus ofpatent documents.ReferencesAhmad, K. 2000.
