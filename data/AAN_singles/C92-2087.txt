The hierarchical relationon verbs has been dealt with as a binary relationon verbs, but it should be dealt with as logicalrelation on predicates.
We will define the logicalform of the hierarchical relation on verbs andthen discuss which part of the syntactic struc-ture of the definition sentence represents thatrelation.
We will call the main predicate verbin this part the definition verb.
Furthermore wewill describe how to semiautomatically select heproper meaning of the definition verb and theproper correspondence b tween cases of an entryverb and the definition verb in order to extractthe hierarchical relation as logical relation.1 IntroductionThe syntactic processing has been playing themain role in a natural anguage processing sys-tem.
But we have come to know that we can'tconstruct a practical system with only this pro-cessing and that the semantic processing is nec-essary for it.
Inference plays an important rolein the semantic processing, we therefore need alarge knowledge base about meaning of wordsand we must treat it as logical relation.Hierarchical relation between words is in-evitable and transitive, and it is a importantrelation in the large knowledge base.
Becauseinevitable relation holds at any time and the re-liability of conclusions inferred from it doesn'tfall down and transitive relation can be describedefficiently.There were some researches on extracting thehierarchical relation between words from defini-tion sentences in a ordinary dictionary\[I\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4 l.But they treated it as only binary relation be-tween words.
Verbs correspond to n-ary predi-cates on entities and we therefore must describethe correspondence b tween the variables (thatis case or syntactic role) of a subordinate verband ones of its superordinate v rb.
But this cor-respondence an't be described if the relation istreated as binary relation between words.We will propose how to extract he hierarchi-cal relation with a logical form on verbs fromdefinition sentences in a Japanese dictionary.Firstly, we will define the logical form of thehierarchical relation on verbs and then discusswhich part of the syntactic structure of the defi-nition sentence represents hat relation.
We willcall the main predicate verb in this part the def-inition verb.
Secondly, we will describe how tosemiautomatically select he proper meaning ofthe definition verb and the proper correspon-dence between the variables of an entry verb andones of the ~lefinition verb.
Lastly, we will reportabout the result of a experiment to extract heACTES DE COLING-92.

Considering the polysemy of verbs, eachmeaning of a siugle verb must correspond to thedistinct predicate.
For example, "~-~ & "(love)as first meaning is used with the form of "x~ $~x2 '~ ~ ~"(xt  love x~) * aa~d corresponds to'~-~)- ~ 1 (Xl, X2)'.Furthermore, we will not deal with intensionalverbs in this paper.2 Log ica l  Form o f  H ie rarch ica lRe la t ion  on  VerbsVerbs correspond to predicates on entities.
IfVL(rh, ...,~,~) is the subordinate predicate ofvU(~x,...,~,,), both predicates have the samearity ( i.e.
m = n ), there is a one-to-one corre-spondence ?
from {1, ..-,n} to {1, ...,n}, and ifVL(~I, "",~n) is true, Vv(~f(U,...,~O(n) ) is alsotrue at the same time.
That is,W \[VL(x) D VV(~)\], (1)where boldface ~e stands for a tuple of variables.Strictly speaking, the logical form of the hierar-chical relation on verbs is (1).For example, "fiktr 1" is the subordinate verbof "~F  ,5 1"- To describe this logically,Vz~x~ \ [~  ~(x~, x~) ~ ~ ?
~(x~, z~)\],where '~  1 (rh, ~1~)' means that r/~ drink ~12 and'~A~ ,5 ~ (Yl, r~2)' means that ~\]1 take 712.But there are v L and v U such that some ar-guments in vL(~h,...,~,~) don't correspond toany arguments in Vu((t ,  ?
"',(m) or some inVu((I ,  "" ',(,n) don't correspond to any argu-ments in VL(rlx, ...,tin), although v L is a sub-ordinate verb of v ~.
In this case, we concludethat the predicate denoted by 9yV~(~,y)  isa subordinate one of the predicate denoted byqzVU(~e, z).
Therefore, by generalizing (1), weget?
Syntactic role is represented by meazts of a postpo~i-tion, such as "7) 9, and "~", in Japanese.that is,We expand (2) further to restrict the domain ofz, and define the logical form of the hierarchicalrelation on verbs as follows.Def init ion I v L is a subordinate verb of v v, iffor some Nw~ \[v~(~,~)~ N(~)^ V~(~,~)\],where bohlface N stands for a tuple of predicateletters and N(z )  means Nl(Zl) A .

A N,(z,,).A small letter, such as n, v, and v L, stands for alinguistic expression and a capital etter, such asN, V, and V L, stands for the predicate symbolcorresponding to the linguistic expression repre-sented by its small letter.I~br example, "~ 5 1" is a subordinate verb of"~ rY 7., 1" because the following formula holds,Vxy3z\[i~ 5 l (y, x)7J~:~J (z) A '~ ~ 7o 1 (x, z)\],where~ "3 1(r/1, r/2) : r/2 is irrigated by r/l,f f .~ (7/) : r/is moisture,;~ff~7~ 1(~/1,r/2) : rll take on r/2.3 Ext rac t ion3.1 Ext rac t ing  the Hierarchical  Ex-p ress ion  in a Def in i t ion  SentenceDefinit ion 2 77re relation between an entryverb v ~ t and its definition sentence s isV~ \[3yV~(~, y) =- 3z#(x,  z)\].For example, the definition sentence for "~t r  1"(drink) is "~ ?~/ .# 7o l ' ( to  take a drink)and the definition sentence for "il~ 5 1" is "TJ~~ o~d ~) & ~:tY'5 1"(to take on moisture fully).We gettFor convenience, we will omit the number of themeaning of an entry verb.ACTES DE COLING-92.

If the definitionsentence of a entry verb v e corresponds toN(,~) A Yd(,~), (3)then we can easily derive the hierarchical rela-tion between v* and its definition verb v d fromDefinition 2.
In this paragraph, we assume thatthe meaning of the definition verb has been se-lected correctly and we will omit the number ofthe meaning of definition verbs.
How to select itwill be given in 8.2.A definition sentence does not always corre-spond to the logical form as (3).
But if we canget the sentence s ~ which is a part of the defi-nition sentence s and corresponds to the logicalform as (3) and S D S d, then we can also derivethe hierarchical relation between the entry verband the definition verb.
We call s ~ the hierarchi-cal expression in a definition sentence (HED).Now, we will discuss which part of the syntacticstructure of the definition sentence is HED.Definition 3 We get rid of modifiers out of asimple sentence s. We call the rest of s the ker-nel sentence s ~ of s.Since there isn't a expression corresponding toa universal quantifier in the definition sentenceof a verb, we can conclude the following charac-teristic.Character is t ic  1 l f  s ~ is the kernel sentence ofa simple sentence s, then S D S ~ and the logicalform of ~* is (3).For example, the kernel sentence of "~ ?
~i~- - I~  lz~JT"(to kill a pain in the body tem-porally) is "~ ~ 'Y" ( to  kill a pain) and itslogical form isa~d the following formula holds,V?\]1~2~8\[S(~1,7J2,718) 3where S(711, r\]~, 7/8) is the formula correspondingto "~?~i~?
?- - I~=~T"  and means that112 is a pain, 7/s is a body, and ~\]1 kill 7/2 in ~/3temporally.
'~  (r/)' means that ~/is a pain.~T  Qh,r/2)' means that 711 kill ~/2.There is a sentence s which satisfies the fol-lowing characteristic.Character ist ic  2 A sentence s includes a sen-tence s ~ and S D S'.If the definition sentence s of a verb is com-plex, then s satisfies Characteristic 2 and s * isits main clause.
For example, the main clauseof the sentence " ~ ?
~  ~ ~ J: 5 ~zt~-  ~3"(something adheres to X as it covers X) is "~~,~ ~ ;5 "(something adheres to), and it cor-responds to the following formula,~,  (~) A ~ '~-  ~ (~1,~),and the following formula holds,V~l~\[s(~, )where S(~\]l,r/~) is the formula correspondingto "~;O~ ~ .~ 3: ~) { :~T.~, ,  and meansthat something rh adhere to r/2 as r/1 coversr/~, '~fi~ 0l)' means that ~/ is something, and'{ '~  T ~ 0/1, r/~)' means that r/1 adhere to r/~.Meaning of the compound sentence s, in whichtwo sentences (81,82) are connected by a con-junction corresponding to 'and' in English, is ei-ther 'S\] ^  $2' or 'a f ter  $1, $2'.
Therefore, anoperator needs to decide the relation between81 and s~.
In the former case, s satisfies Char-acteristic 2 and s ~ can be both 81 and s~.

Because 82 and 83 aresimple sentences, the kernel sentences of 82 and83 are HEDs.
When the definition sentence issimple, its kernel sentence is HED.If we decide the proper meaning of the defi-nition verb and the proper correspondence fromcases of v e to cases of v d correctly, we conclude(4) N,(~,) ^  N,(~)  ^  V~(~, ~)\].We can get a hierarchical relation between v eand v 't as follows from (4),wv~ \[v?

has HED.What we call the selectional restriction hasbeen used to narrow down candidates fro' syn-tactic structnre in the syntactic processing.
Itis the restriction about the semantic ategory ofa noun phrase which a certain verb can take asa certain case.
The semantic ategory has beencalled the semantic marker or semantic prim~itive, libr example, semantic ategories of thesubjective noun phrase and the objective nounphrase for the verb "fik?~"(drink) must be 'ani-mal' and 'liquid' respectively.
We use this inforomation to semiautomatically select the propermeaning of v d and the proper correspondencefrom cases of v ~ to cases of v d. The informationis mentioned in the Japanese dictionary we usedfor the experiment of extraction.The restriction that if a verb vk c~m take anoun phrase with a e~e e the semantic ategoryof the noun phrase is D is expressed logically asfollows,w \[vk(~) ~ D(~,)\], (~)where xi is the argument corresponding to thecase c, and k is the meaning number of v.

Since we caninfer3x\[human(x) A all_entities(x) lfrom Assumption I and the relation betweendomain predicate, the correspondence from thefirst case of "'~-~ 6 1" to the first case of "~3"satisfies the necessary condition describedin paragraph 3.2.

The definition sentence of an entryverb and the pattern of cases for the entry verband the domain for each of the cases of the entryverb are given in this dictionary (see Appendix).And we can also get the domain for a noun fromthis dictionary.We made a lexical functional grammar whichoutputs the logical fornl of HED as a feature.We parsed the definition sentences and got 1709HEDs whose main predicate verb are given asan entry verb in this dictionary with this gram-man.
We have extracted the hierarchical rela-tions on verbs from 1288 I IEDs.
The averagenumber of candidates which are given the high-est priority by the heuristic described in para-graph 3.2 is 4.6 and there is the correct solutionin 4.6 candidates at tile rate of 70.4%.
The num-ber of meanings of verbs in the highest layer inthe hierarchy is 288, and the average level in thehierarchy is 2.7.
Maybe this value is so little.We think in this point since IPAL is a basic verhdictionary its entry verbs are in a comparativelyhigh ordinate in hierarchy of all verbs.5 Conc lus ionWe have defined the logical form of tile hi-erarchical relation on verbs and have describedhow to extract it from definition sentences ill aJapanese dictionary.The method described in this paper is for aJapanese dictionary, but it can be applied toother languages dictionary, too.Acq\]I,S DE COtdNG-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ao\[rr 1992 5 7 9 PROC.
