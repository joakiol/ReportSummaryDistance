University of California, BerkeleyPrincipal Investigator: Robert WilenskyThe objective of our intelligent language systems work is to conduct basic research in theareas of language understanding, common-sense inference, and knowledge representation.For specifically, we are interested in:(1) Producing better user interfaces.
(2) Enabling the automatic processing of natural language text by computer.
(3) Buildingautonomous planning agents that can operate in complex environments.Much of our work has focused on the design and implementation of a Unix Consultant (UC)program.
This system carries out a dialog in English to answer user's queries about the UNIXoperating system.
UC comprises a natural language parsing and generation system, a goalanalyzer that hypothesizes user's goals in different contexts, a user model component thatallows UC to tailor answers to the user's level of expertise, a conversational planner thatallows flexible reaction to user requests, a response formation mechanism that enables fromof response to be concise and appropriate, and (iv) a knowledge-intensive planner thatallows UC produce complex plans and warnings of potential plan failuresWe have also been interested in developing a general theory of inference for textunderstanding.
Our previous work involved the development of a theory of inference fortext understanding which identifies six classes of inference, and uses a highly-parallelmarker-passing mechanism to identify potential inferences.
We designed and implementeda system which uses this theory to correctly make inferences which were previously possibleonly with a much larger number of highly-specialized rules.Recent Accomplishments- Developed the details of a theory of the incremental acquisition of new metaphoric wordsenses.
Two distinct kinds of learning were explored: the first is based on a theory ofmetaphorical similarity, the second on a theory of the hierarchical preservation of structurefrom the source to the target domains of conventional metaphors.
Implemented sixteendistinct metaphor types with several hundred senses for 22 of the most common verbs.- Started implementation of a knowledge acquisition system that can augment UC'sknowledge base by reading the on-line UNIX man pages.- Developed extensions to the KODIAK representation language and incorporated learningtechniques into UC Teacher, the knowledge acquisition component of our UNIX Consultant(UC) system.- Addressed the principle theoretical issues necessary to advance our theory of inference, inparticular a notion of sufficient explanation and focus.- Implemented a new grammar of a portion of English, which emphasizes the relationbetween grammar and meaning.
The grammar extends commonly-used unificationtechniques for parsing and representing rammatical rules.- Analyzed how various properties of "operationality" theories may effect the efficiency ofExplanation Based Learning algorithms.
Focused on problems relating to the behaviors ofoperationality boundary conditions.
Developed and implementated polynomial-timealgorithm for EBL, where previous algorithms were exponential.263PlansOver the next year, we anticipate working on the following problems:- Augment he capabilities of our knowledge representation system to better handle problemsof change over time, quantified statements, and hypothetical statements.- Build prototype version of a new language understanding system that combines inference,interpretation, and parsing.- Introduce a notion of level of importance into our inference algorithm, enabling theunderstander to focus attention.- Begin reimplementation UC to better integrate components and take advantage of newtechnology.264
