They represent  the  necessarysyntact i c  knowledge o f  a language wh ich  i s  the  base  fo r  ana l -ys i~ sentences  o f  th i s  le~guage.
The bund les  ere par ts  o ft rees  in  a very  genera l i zed  fo rm.

Fo l low ing  the  mode l ,  these  bund les  g iveus  a h igh  measure  o f  surety ,  fo r  the  ana lys i s .- 244 -The bund les  a re  s to red  in  the  sys tem in  a very  concent r -a ted  fo rm.
For  example fo r  a noun group  w i th  a noun l i ke  " tab-le"  a t  the  top  there  i s  on ly  one bud le  w i th  a l l  poss ib lefacu l ta t ive  nodes .
So we have in  a bund le  in fo rmat ions  aboutthe  mode o f  occur rence  o f  a node ,  i .e .
i f  a node i s  ob l igatory ,facu l ta t ive  e tc .The bund les  serve  a l so  as  descr ip t ion  fo r  the  dominancebehav iour  o f  word forms (one par t  o f  the  fo rmal  descr ip t iono f  the i r  features ) ,  thus  we have a s t rong  connect ion  betweena bund le  and a word formwhich  can"s tand"  a t  the  top  o f  thebund le .
For  th i s  purpose  ~he bund les  have a spec ia l  ex terna lshape  fo r  l ingu is t i c  work.
For  ins tance ,  a f in i te  verb  fo rmo f  the  German verb  Sschre iben"  has  severa l  bund les  in  i t sdominance component ,  one o f  these  i sFIN (ACT?A 0BJ3fA (PAT ~ DAS) ?

The f i r s t  poss ib -i l i t y  i s  out l ined  in  my d isser ta t ion  (AROLD 1976) as a s t rong- 245 -wherebottom-up and mul t ip le -path  analys?8.
But fo r  a workingsystem we in tend  to fo l low the second way.In  the paper a shor t  summary of  the system wi l l  be g iven .The syntact i c  analysts ,  o f  a sentence  ~?ven by the formal de-sc r ip t ion  of  the syntact i c  features  of  the  wordforms iS  madeby three  s teps .
These three  s teps  d i f fe r  one from the  o therby d~f ferent  methods.In  the f i r s t  s tep  an nau~nented t rans i t ion  network n(ATe) i s  used to const ruc t  a rough s t ruc ture  o f  the sentence .The second s tep  uses the bundles which are members of  t hedominance component of  the wordforms to  f ind  out so -ca l ledsubord lnnt ion  poss ib l l i t i ee .
The resu l t  o f  the  second s tep  i sa loop- f ree  ~raph, which i s  t rans formed ur?ng the th i rd  s tepto  a ~aph contus ing  the dependency treem which desor?be thesyntact i c  s t ruc tures  of  the an~yeed sentence .
In  the th i rds tep  the cond i t ions  of  the bundles (ob l igator7  and facu l ta t ivenodes e tc . )
are  used as we l l  as the condlttonm com?n~ fromthe  shape of  the resu l t ing  graph.Up to now we ~re on ly  at  the  be~nn~ng of  the  ~nplement-a t ion  o f  the system.
