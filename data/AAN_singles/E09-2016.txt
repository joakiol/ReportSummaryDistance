Proceedings of the EACL 2009 Demonstrations Session, pages 61?64,Athens, Greece, 3 April 2009. c?2009 Association for Computational LinguisticsThree BioNLP Tools Powered by a Biological LexiconAbstractIn this paper, we demonstrate three NLPapplications of the BioLexicon, which is alexical resource tailored to the biologydomain.
The applications consist of adictionary-based POS tagger, a syntacticparser, and query processing for biomedicalinformation retrieval.
Biologicalterminology is a major barrier to theaccurate processing of literature withinbiology domain.
In order to address thisproblem, we have constructed theBioLexicon using both manual and semi-automatic methods.
We demonstrate theutility of the biology-oriented lexiconwithin three separate NLP applications.1 IntroductionProcessing of biomedical text can frequently beproblematic, due to the huge number of technicalterms and idiosyncratic usages of those terms.Sometimes, general English words are used indifferent ways or with different meanings inbiology literature.There are a number of linguistic resourcesthat can be use to improve the quality ofbiological text processing.
WordNet (Fellbaum,1998) and the NLP Specialist Lexicon 1  aredictionaries commonly used within biomedicalNLP.WordNet is a general English thesaurus whichadditionally covers biological terms.
However,since WordNet is not targeted at the biologydomain, many biological terms and derivationalrelations are missing.The Specialist Lexicon is a syntactic lexiconof biomedical and general English words,providing linguistic information about individualvocabulary items (Browne et al, 2003).
Whilstit contains a large number of biomedical terms,1 http://SPECIALIST.nlm.hih.govits focus is on medical terms.
Therefore somebiology-specific terms, e.g., molecular biologyterms, are not the main target of the lexicon.In response to this, we have constructed theBioLexicon (Sasaki et al, 2008), a lexicalresource tailored to the biology domain.
We willdemonstrate three applications of the BioLexicon,in order to illustrate the utility of the lexiconwithin the biomedical NLP field.The three applications are:?
BLTagger: a dictionary-based POS taggerbased on the BioLexicon?
Enju full parser enriched by theBioLexicon?
Lexicon-based query processing forinformation retrieval2.
Summary of the BioLexiconIn this section, we provide a summary of theBioLexicon (Sasaki et al, 2008).
It containswords belonging to four part-of-speechcategories: verb, noun, adjective, and adverb.Quochi et al(2008) designed the databasemodel of the BioLexicon which follows theLexical Markup Framework (Francopoulo et al,2008).2.1 Entries in the Biology LexiconThe BioLexicon accommodates both generalEnglish words and terminologies.
Biomedicalterms were gathered from existing biomedicaldatabases.
Detailed information regarding thesources of biomedical terms can be found in(Rebholz-Schuhmann et al, 2008).
The lexiconentries consist of the following:(1) Terminological verbs: 759 base forms (4,556inflections) of terminological verbs withautomatically extracted verbsubcategorization framesYutaka Sasaki 1   Paul Thompson1   John McNaught 1, 2   Sophia Ananiadou1, 21 School of Computer Science, University of Manchester2  National Centre for Text MiningMIB, 131 Princess Street, Manchester, M1 7DN, United Kingdom{Yutaka.Sasaki,Paul.Thompson,John.McNaught,Sophia.Ananiadou}@manchester.ac.uk61(2)Terminological adjectives: 1,258terminological adjectives.
(3) Terminological adverbs: 130 terminologicaladverbs.
(4) Nominalized verbs: 1,771  nominalized verbs.
(5) Biomedical terms: Currently, the BioLexiconcontains biomedical terms in the categories ofcell (842 entries, 1,400 variants), chemicals(19,637 entries, 106,302 variants), enzymes(4,016 entries, 11,674 variants), diseases(19,457 entries, 33,161 variants), genes andproteins (1,640,608 entries, 3,048,920variants), gene ontology concepts (25,219entries, 81,642 variants), molecular roleconcepts (8,850 entries, 60,408 variants),operons (2,672 entries, 3,145 variants),protein complexes (2,104 entries, 2,647variants), protein domains (16,940 entries,33,880 variants), Sequence ontology concepts(1,431 entries, 2,326 variants), species(482,992 entries, 669,481 variants), andtranscription factors (160 entries, 795variants).In addition to the existing gene/protein names,70,105 variants of gene/protein names have beennewly extracted from 15 million MEDLINEabstracts.
(Sasaki et al, 2008)2.2.
Comparison to existing lexiconsThis section focuses on the words andderivational relations of words that are coveredby our BioLexicon but not by comparableexisting resources.
Figures 1 and 2 show thepercentage of the terminological words andderivational relations (such as the wordretroregulate and the derivational relationretroregulate ?
retroregulation) in our lexiconthat are also found in WorNet and the SpecialistLexicion.Since WordNet is not targeted at the biologydomain, many biological terms and derivationalrelations are not included.Because the Specialist Lexicon is abiomedical lexicon and the target is broader thanour lexicon, some biology-oriented words andrelations are missing.
For example, theSpecialist Lexicon includes the term retro-regulator but not retro-regulate.
This means thatderivational relations of retro-regulate are notcovered by the Specialist Lexicon.3.
Application 1: BLTaggerDictionary-based POS tagging is advantageouswhen a sentence contains technical terms thatconflict with general English words.
If the POStags are decided without considering possibleoccurrences of biomedical terms, then POSerrors could arise.For example, in the protein name ?met proto-oncogene precursor?, met might be incorrectlyrecognized as a verb by a non dictionary-basedtagger.Input sentence:?IL-2-mediated activation of ??IL/NPIL-2/NN-BIOMED-/-2/CDmediated/VVDIL-2-mediated/UNKNOWNIL/NP2/CDIL-2/NN-BIOMED?????????
?mediated/VVDmediate/VVPmediate/VVof/INmediated/VVN-/--/-mediated/VVNdictionary-based tagging of/INFig.

2  Comparison with Specialist Lexicon62In the dictionary, biomedical terms are givenPOS tag "NN-BIOMED".
Given a sentence, thedictionary-based POS tagger works as follows.?
Find all word sequences that match thelexical entries, and create a token graph (i.e.,trellis) according to the word order.?
Estimate the score of every path using theweights of the nodes and edges, throughtraining using Conditional Random Fields.?
Select the best path.Figure 3 shows an example of our dictionary-based POS tagger BLTagger.Suppose that the input is ?IL-2-mediatedactivation of?.
A trellis is created based on thelexical entries in the dictionary.
The selectioncriteria for the best path are determined by theCRF tagging model trained on the Genia corpus(Kim et al, 2003).
In this example,IL-2/NN-BIOMED -/- mediated/VVNactivation/NN of/INis selected as the best path.Following Kudo et al (2004), we adapted thecore engine of the CRF-based morphologicalanalyzer, MeCab2, to our POS tagging task.The features used were:?
POS?
BIOMED?
POS-BIOMED?
bigram of adjacent POS?
bigram of adjacent BIOMED?
bigram of adjacent POS-BIOMEDDuring the construction of the trellis, whitespace is considered as the delimiter unlessotherwise stated within dictionary entries.
Thismeans that unknown tokens are charactersequences without spaces.As the BioLexicon associates biomedicalsemantic IDs with terms, the BLTagger attachessemantic IDs to the tokenizing/tagging results.4.
Application 2: Enju full parser with theBioLexiconEnju (Miyao, et al, 2003) is an HPSG parser,which is tuned to the biomedical domain.Sentences are parsed based on the output of the2 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?groupid=177856/Stepp POS tagger, which is also tuned to thebiomedical domain.To further tune Enju to the biology domain,(especially molecular biology), we havemodified Enju to parse sentences based on theoutput of the BLTagger.As the BioLexicon contains many multi-wordbiological terms, the modified version of Enjuparses token sequences in which some of thetokens are multi-word expressions.
This iseffective when very long technical terms (e.g.,more than 20 words) are present in a sentence.To use the dictionary-based tagging forparsing, unknown words should be avoided asmuch as possible.
In order to address this issue,we added entries in WordNet and the SpecialistLexicion to the dictionary of BLTagger.The enhancement in the performance of Enjubased on these changes is still under evaluation.However, we demonstrate a functional, modifiedversion of Enju.5.
Application 3: Query processing for IRIt is sometimes the case that queries forbiomedical IR systems contain long technicalterms that should be handled as single multi-word expressions.We have applied BLTagger to the TREC 2007Genomics Track data (Hersh et al, 2007).
Thegoal of the TREC Genomics Track 2007 was togenerate a ranked list of passages for 36 queriesthat relate to biological events and processes.Firstly, we processed the documents with aconventional tokenizer and standard stop-wordremover, and then created an index containingthe words in the documents.
Queries areprocessed with the BLTagger and multi-wordexpressions are used as phrase queries.
Passagesare ranked with Okapi BM25 (Robertson et al,1995).Table 1 shows the preliminary Mean AveragePrecision (MAP) scores of applying theBLTagger to the TREC data set.By adding biology multi-word expressionsidentified by the BLTagger to query terms (row(a)), we were able to obtain a slightly betterPassage2 score.
As the BLTagger outputssemantic IDs which are defined in theBioLexicon, we tried to use these semantic IDsfor query expansion (rows (b) and (d)).
However,the MAP scores degraded.636.
ConclusionsWe have demonstrated three applications of theBioLexicon, which is a resource comprisinglinguistic information, targeted for use withinbio-text mining applications.We have described the following threeapplications that will be useful for processing ofbiological literature.?
BLTagger: dictionary-based POS taggerbased on the BioLexicon?
Enju full parser enriched by theBioLexicon?
Lexicon-based query processing forinformation retrievalOur future work will include further intrinsicand extrinsic evaluations of the BioLexicon inNLP, including its  application to informationextraction tasks in the biology domain.
