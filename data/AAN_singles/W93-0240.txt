Closing the Gap Between Discourse Structure andCommunicat ive  Intent ionPaul Wu Horng JyhNational University of SingaporeSingapore, 0511The Republic of SingaporeE-mail: paulwu@iss.nus.sg1 Int roduct ionIll tile past, quite a few phenomena related to discourse structures have been studied, such as lexica\]cohesion (HMliday and Hasan, 1976), coherence relation (Hobbs, 1985; Wu and Lytinen, 1989), andrhetorical relation (Mann and Thompson, 1988).
On the other hand, there Mso exists al)uadautresearch on communicative intention such as speech act theory (Searle, 1968) and relevance maxim(Wilson and Sperber, 1986).
One logical question to ask is then:What is the relationship between discourse structures and communicative intention?In tile following, we shall l, ake a.n objective approach to bridging tile gap between these two s(~ts o\['I)henomena.
More specifically, certain discourse structures and communicative intentio,,s are tak('~,.as literally as possible, from their "native" theories; Then, without any i)redefined fram(,wol'k, w('observe the emergence of an integral discourse model encompassing these structures and iJltellt.i()llsvia necessary "bridging" knowledge and inferences.
Thus, on the one hand, our integrative vi(,wstoward discourse structures and intentions are similar to (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) and (Moore a ll(IPollack, 1992) in the sense that we hold?
The separation of attentional nd intentional "tracks" of discourse \] .?
The stratification of coherence (informational) and rhetorical (intentional) rela.ti(Jlls.On the other hand, unlike previous work, we formulate knowledge sources which expl:,i.l, how the,emergence of integrated iscourse model is possible, rather than just identifying such integrati()=~.hi particular, the following knowledge sources are identified:KN-LC  which associate concepts denoted by words (anchoring Lexi(:a.l Cohesion)KN-SA which interpret utterances in terms of the speaker's mental models whi(:h consist or I)r(,I)~,-sitions embedded in attitude contexts (anchoring Speech Acts)KN-CR which specify a. domain theory of physical world (anchoring Coherence Relal.ious)KN-RR which specify a domain theory of mental dynamics (anchoring Rhetorical Relatiom~s)The above four knowledge sources in turns are governed by the ultimate principles of R.elevall('('Maxim (KN-RM).
In short, by explicating the knowledge behind discourse structures and illt('tlti(,Hs.we a.
(lvoc~tte hat the stratification of discourse structures and intentions is motivatod/stll~l)~='t(,~lby modularized, but related, knowledge sources.1This, howcver, will not bc discussed here; interested readers are referred to (Wu, 1993) for some' (I dis~'u.~siol~.1522 A concrete  exampleIn the following, we propose a sequence of specific questions concerning lexica.I cohesions (I,(').coherence relations (CR), rhetorical relations (RIR), speech acts (SA), and conversa.tioual maxiu~s(C,M); more specifically, we intend to demonstrate the following strata?
X coherence relation encompasses Y lexical cohesion (CR > LC).?
X rhetorical relation encompasses Y coherence relation (RR > CR).?
X speech act is achieved by Y rhetorical relation (SA > RR).?
X relevance maxim is obeyed by Y speech act (RM > SA).Let's look at an example which is composed for an independent purpose; It is taken froln (Man.and Thompson, 1986):($1) I love to collect classic automobiles.
($2) My favorite car is my 1887 Duryea.First, let's observe that the semantic/propositional interpretation of SI and $2 yields th(, lidlowing (main) propositions:LOVE(l, { a, I OLD(a) & AUTOMOBILE(a) })FAVORITE(I, b), CAR(b), b = 1887-DuryeaThat is, I love antique automobiles and my favorite car is the 1887 Duryea.
By detecting thefollowing lexical cohesions (between the words denoting the concepts):KN-LC-I:'CAR' is a synonym of 'AUTOMOBILE''FAVORITE' is similar to 'LOVE'We conclude the following coherence relation,Exemplification(S2, S1) - (F1)since as (Hobbs, 1985) defines it, we canKN-CR-I:Infer p(A) from S1 and p(a.)
from $2, where a is a member or subset of Ain our case, 'p' is 'LOVE' (or 'FAVORITE') and 'A' is the set of automobiles a.nd 'a' is th(' ('a.,' ( i ,y1887 Duryea).Now, we have demonstrated the connection between coherence relations a.nd lexical cohesi(,lls.Let's look at how this is connected to rhetorical relations and speech acts.
First, we need to (,xl.emlthe interpretation of $1 and $2 from purely propositional to including prol)ositional attitudes (( 'f.
(Cohen and Levesque, 1990), (Wu and Lytinen, 1991) and (Wu and Lytiuen, 1992)),KN-SA-1:$1 = BEL(Spkr, LOVE(Spkr, { a \[ OLD(a) & AUTOMOBILE(a) })) (1,'2)$2 = BEL(Spkr, (FAVORITE(Spkr, b), CAR(b), b = 1887-Duryea))153That is, the speaker (spkr) 'believes,' as well as 'stated,' that S1 and $2.
In order to conceive th,'intention behind the speaker's making $2, it is reasonable to assume thatMBEL(Hr, Spkr, ?BEL(Hr, LOVE(Spkr, { a\] OLD(a) & AUTOMOBILE(a) }))) - (F3)That is, the speaker and the hearer (Hr) mutually believe (MBEL) that the hearer weakly believes(?BEL) S1.
Thus, in order to facilitate the "acceptance" of S1, the speaker uses $2 as an 'evidence'to support S1.
That is, the following speech act and rhetorical relation are achieved simultaneously.ASSERT(Spkr, S1) and Evidence(S2, S1)The Evidence rhetorical relation is achieved through associating the following knowledge concerningpersuasiveness and the Exemplification coherence relation (an instance of which is recognized inF1):(KN-RR-1)IF the speaker provides more detailed information about a fact P (such as stating anexample of P)THEN the hearer is more obliged to believe P (because the speaker eally wants him tobelieve P)Once the Evidence rhetorical relation is recognized, the hearer ecognizes that the speaker eallywants him to believe P from the THEN-part of KN-RR-i:WANT(Spkr, Hr, BEL(Hr, LOVE(Spkr, ( a\[ OLD(a) & AUTOMOBILE(a) }) ) ) -  (F4)Based on F2, F3 and F4, the hearer has recognized, according to Searle, the sincerity, the prep?tra-tory, and the essential conditions of the Assertion speech act, respectively.
Together with theEvidence rhetorical relation, it is clear that the speaker is making an assertion.Now, the last question remains as which relevance maxim has been obeyed during the a bov,~process.
According to (Sperber and Wilson, 1986), relevance is obeyed by producing the followingcontextual effects (KN-RMs) (1)enhancing a statement (2) canceling a statement (3)introducing ;tstatement.
Thus, in $2, the speaker has addressed the relevance by producing a definite contextualeffects to enhance the certainty of a proposition.3 D iscuss ion  and conc lus ionIn summary, we have demonstrated through tracing detailed examples that an integrated model ofdiscourse does encompass discourse structures and intentions.
We also take an objective approachin arguing so, since we do not predefine any framework to demonstrate our thesis; Rather.
wefollow existing theories and by identifying the necessary bridging knowledge and int~erences, wejust observe the integration emerging out of the individual discourse structures and intentions ;isdefined in their native theories.This integrative view is similar to others, e.g., (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) and (Moore and Pollack.1992).
Due to the lack of space, we did not deal with the full ranges of issues, but many of ourpositions are identical to others, in particular:1.
Discourse structure and intention form a strata1542.
Many to many mapping exists between adjacent layers of the strata, e.g..
I)etween coh('reHC,'and rhetorical relations for both text generation and interpretation3.
The nucleus and satellite, if exist, may not coincide between two adjacent layers.What we have demonstrated in this paper is a particular (one-to-one) instance of a strata o\['discourse structure and intention.
To be more specific, we demonstrate how a lexical cohesion givesrise to coherence relation; a coherence relation to a rhetorical relation; then to a speech act and arelevance maxim.
In doing so, we feel we have extended the research in the following ways?
Address a wider range of strata; not only between coherence and rhetorical relations, but a.llthe way from lexical cohesions till relevance maxims;?
Formulate knowledge which explain the emergence of such connections between layers o\['discourseThe second point has been kept in the background in many previous research.
For example, nowit can be readily understood that an Exemplification coherence relation can give rise to an Evi-dence rhetorical relation.
However, knowledge such as (KN-RR-1) is kept implicit; but upon closerinspection, it becomes obvious without such knowledge the connection between Exemplificationand Evidence can not be established.
Thus, flushing out the explanatory theory for the mappingbetween discourse strata has been identified as our most urgent research topic.
In particular, th(,knowledge in the maxim level (KN-RM) is much in need of further study, especially with respe(lto other layers of the strata.REFERENCES(Cohen and Levesque, 1990) Cohen, P. and Levesque, H.
