Building a Bilingual WordNet-Like Lexicon:the New Approach and AlgorithmsYang Liu, Shiwen Yu, Jiangsheng YuInstitute of Computaitional Linguistics, Peking UnviersityBeijing, 100871, China{liuyang, yusw, yujs} @ pku.edu.cnAbstractA bilingual concept MRD is of significance forIE, MT, WSD and the like.
However, it isreasonably difficult to build such a lexicon forthere exist two ontologies, also, the evolution ofsuch a lexicon is quite challenging.
In thispaper, we would like to put forth the newapproach to building a bilingual WordNet-likelexicon and to dwell on some of the pivotalalgorithms.A characteristic of this new approach is toemphasize the inheritance and transformationof the existent monolingual lexicon.
On the onehand, we have extracted all the commonknowledge in WordNet as the semantic basisfor further use.
On the other hand, we havedeveloped a visualized developing tool for thelexicographers to interactively operate on toexpress the bilingual semantics.
The bilinguallexicon has thus gradually come into being inthis natural process.ICL now has benefited a lot by employingthis new approach to build CCD (ChineseConcept Dictionary), a bilingual WordNet-likelexicon, in Peking University.1 IntroductionAs the processing of content information hasnowadays become the center of NLP, abilingual concept MRD is of increasingly greatsignificance for IE, MT, WSD and the like.
Andit is for sure that the computational linguistswould find such a lexicon indispensable anduseful as semantic information when facingambiguities in languages in their applications.At the same time, Princeton University?sWordNet, after so many years?
development,has exerted a profound influence on semanticlexicons [Vossen, 1998].When building a Chinese-English bilingualconcept MRD, we must take the issue ofcompatibility with WordNet into account.
Inother words, for each English concept inWordNet, there should exist a correspondingChinese concept in the bilingual lexicon andvice versa.
Such a bilingual lexicon can offerbetter reusability and openness.The Institute of Computational Linguistics(ICL), Peking University, with this point ofview, has launched the Project CCD (ChineseConcept Dictionary).The expectant CCD might be described asfollows [Yu et al 2001]: it should carry themain relations already defined in WordNet withmore or less updates to reflect the reality ofcontemporary Chinese, and it should be abilingual concept lexicon with the parallelChinese-English concepts to be simultaneouslyincluded.Such a bilingual WordNet-like lexicon ofChinese-English concepts can largely meet ourneed of applications.However, it is by no means easy to buildsuch a lexicon.
It is quite obvious that theresynchronously exist two ontologies in the samelexicon.
One is in the English culture and theother is in the Chinese culture.
As there mightbe different concepts and relations in eachlanguage, the mapping of the relevant conceptsin different languages is inevitable.
Also, theevolution of such a lexicon with passing oftime, an issue linked closely to the mappingissue, is quite challenging.In conclusion, it?s a quite demanding job tobuild such a lexicon, especially for the design ofthe approach and the realization of thedeveloping tool.
Any fruitful solution shouldgive enough consideration to the complexity ofthese issues.2 The New Approach to Building a BilingualWordNet-Like LexiconThe distinct principles of organization ofWordNet can be described below: concepts,viz.
synsets, act as the basic units of lexicalsemantics, and the hyponymy of the conceptsacts as the basic relation among others.
Uponthis tree structure of hyponymy, there also existsome other semantic relations like holonymy,antonymy, attribute, entailment, cause, etc.,which further interweave all the concepts in thelexicon into a huge semantic network, say99,643 synset nodes all told in WordNet 1.6.What really counts and takes a lot of troublein building WordNet itself is how to set up allthese synsets and relations properly, and, howto maintain the semantic consistencies in caseof frequent occurrences of modifications duringthe revision [Beckwith et al 1993].
As thedesirable developing tool based directly on alarge-scale network has not yet appeared, due tothe connatural complexity of net structure, thisproblem is all the way a Gordian knot for thelexicographers.To build a Chinese WordNet in the sameroute just as Princeton had taken and then toconstruct the mapping between these twoWordNets may be not a satisfying idea.So, it is crucial that we had better find anapproach to reusing the English commonknowledge already described in WordNet as thesemantic basis for Chinese when building thebilingual lexicon.
And this kind of reusingshould contain some capabilities of adjustmentsto the bilingual concepts besides word-for-wordtranslations.
If we can manage it, not only thebuilding of the monolingual Chinese lexiconbenefits but also the mapping betweenChinese-English [Liu et al 2002].
Actually, thepractice of mapping has now become a directand dynamic process and the evolution of thebilingual lexicon is no longer a problem.
Acomparatively high efficiency may be achieved.Such are the essential ideas of the newsolution.
A characteristic of this approach is toemphasize the inheritance and transformationof the already existent monolingual lexicon.Accordingly, it deals with 2 processes.
Thefirst process simply gets the semantic basis forfurther use and the lexicographers?
work alwaysfocuses on the second.
In fact, the bilinguallexicon has just gradually come into being inthis more natural process.2.1 The Inheritance Process of WordNetThis process is intended to extract the commonhyponymy information in WordNet as thesemantic basis for future use.However, to extract the full hyponyms for acertain concept is by no means easy.
As wehave examined, the number of hyponyms for asynset ranges from 0 to 499 with a maximalhyponymy depth of 15 levels in WordNet.
Thisshows the structure of the potential hyponymytree is quite unbalanced.
Due to this highcomplexity, the ordinary searching algorithmcan hardly do.
If one inputs the word entity asentry in WordNet 1.6 and tries to search its fullhyponyms, he will get nothing but a note offailure.
Sure enough, if the entry is not entitybut another word, say entrance, the searchingwill probably do.
The cases actually depend onthe location of the entry word in the potentialhyponymy tree in WordNet.
The higher thelevel of the entry word, the less possibility ofsuccess the searching will have.By now, we have got a refined searchingalgorithm for getting the full hyponymyinformation in WordNet [Liu et al 2002].By and large, it involves a series of TwoWay Scanning action and of Gathering/Sievingand Encoding action, with each round of theseries intending to get information of nodes onone same level in the hyponymy tree.By this special algorithm, the complexity ofsearching is greatly reduced.
We can even getall the 45,148 hyponyms for the topmost entryword entity, in 100 or so seconds, on anordinary PC.
People who are interested in it canfind more details about the algorithm in [Liu etal, 2002].2.2 The Transformation Process of WordNetThis process is for the lexicographers tointeractively operate on the hyponymy tree toexpress the bilingual semantics.
The bilinguallexicon will gradually come into being in thisprocess.For this task, we have designed and realizeda visualized and data-sensitive tree control with8 well-defined operations on it, some of thepivotal algorithms for which will be discussedlater.After extracting the hyponymy informationfor each initial semantic unit in WordNetrespectively, we then organize the informationinto a hyponymy tree by using the above treecontrol.
Every tree node, viz.
synset, still carriesall other semantic relations already described inWordNet.
The lexicographers can now operateon the tree interactively.The actual practices of the lexicographersare as follows:(i) For each tree node in English, if thereexists a corresponding Chinese concept, thelexicographers simply translate the Englishconcept into Chinese.
(ii) If there does not, cases may be that theEnglish concept is either too general or toospecific for Chinese.
(ii1) For the former case, the lexicographerscan create new hyponyms in Chinese for theEnglish concept and link all these newhyponyms in Chinese with the English concept.
(ii2) For the latter case, the lexicographersjust delete the English concept in a special way,which means the English concept has noequivalent in Chinese and only links theEnglish concept with its hypernym.In fact, all the above-mentioned semanticmanipulations concerning hyponymy relationhave already been encoded into the 8 visualizedoperations on the hyponymy tree.
In addition, inthe 8 operations, some other semantic relationsalready described in the synsets in WordNet areall properly dealt with through systematic andreasonable calculations.We can see these adjustments clearly in thedescription of the algorithms.Now, it is of much significance that thelexicographers need simply operate on thehyponymy tree to express their semanticintention and no longer care for lots of detailsabout the background database, for theforeground operations have already fulfilled allthe automatic modifications of the database.In this way, the problems of mappingbetween the bilingual concepts and evolution ofthe bilingual lexicon are dynamically resolved.Our developing tool for building thebilingual WordNet-like lexicon has come out asbelow.The interface view shows the hyponymytree for the entry food, which is one of the 25initial semantic units of noun in WordNet withthe category value of 13.
For the currentlychosen node, the lexicographers can furtheradopt a proper operation on it when needed.This new kind of Visualized AuxiliaryConstruction of Lexicon is characteristic of theinheritance and transformation of the existentmonolingual lexicon.
We call it Vacol modelfor short.As we see, the new approach, in fact, isindependent of any specific languages andactually offers a general solution for building abilingual WordNet-like lexicon.3 Tree Operations and their AlgorithmsAs the lexicographers always work on the tool,the visualized, data-sensitive tree control withoperations on it is the key to the new approach.By now, we?ve schemed a set of algorithmsbased on the Treeview control in the MicrosoftVisual Studio 6.0 and eventually implemented adata-sensitive tree control with operations on it.3.1 Tree OperationsThe 8 operations that we have semantically welldefined are listed as follows.
When choosing asynset node in the hyponymy tree, these are theoperations from which the lexicographers canfurther adopt one.
[1] To add a synset as brother node;[2] To add a synset as child node;[3] To delete the synset node (not includingits descendants if exist);[4] To delete the synset node (including allits descendants if exist);[5] To cut the subtree;[6] To copy the subtree;[7] To paste the subtree as brother node;[8] To paste the subtree as child node.These operations are all to edit the tree, withrespectively No.
1, 2 for addition, No.
3, 4 fordeletion, and No.
5, 6, 7, 8 for batch movement.In fact, all these operations have beencarefully decided on to make them conciseenough, capable enough and semanticallymeaningful enough.It is easy to prove that any facultative treeform can be attained by iterative practices ofthese 8 operations.3.2 Algorithms for the Tree OperationsThe data structure of a hyponymy tree with nnodes can be illustrated by the following table:Pos1 Ptr11 Ptr12 ?
Ptr1m BasicInfo1Pos2 Ptr21 Ptr22 ?
Ptr2m BasicInfo2?
?
?
?
?
?Posn Ptrn1 Ptrn2 ?
Ptrnm BasicInfonThere are 3 parts of information in eachrecord: the structural information {Posi}, therelation information {Ptri1 (viz.
hyponymy),Ptri2, ?
, Ptrim} and all other pieces of basicinformation {BasicInfoi} which are relevantonly to the concept proper.Among these 3 parts of information, {Posi}is used for the tree structure whereas both {Ptri1,Ptri2, ?
, Ptrim} and {BasicInfoi} for lexicalsemantics.
It should be noticed that Posi onlystands for a special encoding for the tree in theforeground and is somewhat different fromPtri1, a relational pointer of hyponymy, whichrepresents its specific semantics in thebackground database.
And it is the relations in{Ptri2, ?
, Ptrim} that have highly contributed tothe dense net structure of WordNet.After these analyses, we find that eachoperation should just properly deal with these 3parts of information.
First, it is crucial that twosorts of consistencies should be maintained.One is that of the structural information {Posi}of the tree and the other is that of the relationinformation {Ptri1, Ptri2, ?
, Ptrim} of thelexicon.
Following that, the cases of the basicinformation {BasicInfoi} are comparativelysimple for only English-Chinese translationsare involved.Before we can go on to dwell on thealgorithms, we still need a little while to touchon the structural information {Posi}.
When wesay a position Posi, we actually mean thelocation of a certain node in the tree and itserves to organize the tree.
For example, a Posiby the value ?005001002?
is to represent such alocation of a node in a tree: at the 1st level, itsancestor being the 5th; at the 2nd level, itsancestor being the 1st; and at the 3rd level, itsancestor viz.
itself now being the 2nd.
In fact,such an encoding onto a linear string does fullyexpress the structural information in a tree andmakes all the tree operations algorithmsfeasible by direct and systematic calculations ofthe new position.If we don?t want to badger with much of thedetails, the algorithms for tree operations can bedescribed in a general way.
Although for eachline of the pseudocode, there indeed are lots ofjobs to do for the programmer.The algorithms described below are suitablefor the non-batch-movement operations, viz.operations [1, 2, 3, 4].
And the batch-movementoperations, viz.
operations [5, 6, 7, 8], can beregarded as their iterative practices.The lexicographers trigger an action on nodei;IF the action is in operations [1, 2, 3, 4]CASE the actionOperations [1]:Add a node with its Pos = NewBrother (Posi);Operations [2]:Add a node with its Pos = NewChild (Posi);Operations [3]:Delete the node with Pos = Posi;Operations [4]:Delete all the nodes with their Pos satisfyingconditions of being descendants of nodei;END CASERecalculate Pos of the rest nodes in the tableaccording to the operation and current Posi;Replace all relevant Ptrj1, Ptrj2 , ?
, Ptrjm with newones according to the operation and current nodei;Refresh the tree;ELSE IFThe lexicographers translate current BasicInfoi fromEnglish to Chinese;END IFThe algorithms have some nice features.Since the structural information {Pos},defined as the primary key of the table, is keptin order, the maintenance of tree structure canalways be completed in a single pass.The maintenance of consistencies of therelation information {Ptrj1, Ptrj2, ?
, Ptrjm} inthe lexicon is also limited to a local section ofthe table.4 ConclusionsICL, Peking University has launched theProject CCD since Sept., 2000.
Due to the nicefeatures of the new approach, we do havebenefited a lot by employing it to build CCD.By now, we have fulfilled more than 32,000Chinese-English concept pairs in noun.In the near future, ICL wants to come to atotal amount of 100,000 or so bilingualconcepts, which might largely meet our need ofapplications.What is more, as the byproducts of the newapproach and experiences, we have even foundsome errors and faults of semantic expressingwith WordNet 1.6.For example, in the lexicon there are manyoccurrences of a node with multiple-father inthe identical category (772 times in noun, e.g.
{radish}) or a node with single-father in theother category (2,172 times in noun, e.g.
{prayer_wheel}).In verb, there even exists a node with fatherbeing oneself (e.g.
{reserve, hold, book}).These phenomena are quite abnormal andpuzzling according to the specification ofWordNet.
Something may have gone wrongwith the classification or implementation.There are also many undisciplined locationsof relational pointers (e.g.
?@?
and ?~?,respectively 7 and 451 times in noun) in DATfiles and some other problems.AcknowledgementsThis work is a component of researches onChinese Information Extraction funded byNational Foundation of Natural Science No.69973005 and Project 985 in Peking Univ.We are especially grateful to Prof. WANGFengxin and Prof. LU Chuan, our linguisticsadvisors, for their unforgettable discussion andsupport.
