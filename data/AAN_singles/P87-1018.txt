SEMANTIC  STRUCTURE ANALYS IS  OF  JAPANESE NOUN PHRASESWITH ADNOMINAL  PART ICLESAkira SH IMAZU,  Shozo NAITO, and Hirosato NOMURABasic Research Laboratories, N.T.T.3-9-11, Midori-cho, Musashino-shi, Tokyo 180, JapanAbstractJapanese has many noun phrase patterns of thetype A no B consisting of two nouns A and B with anadnominal particle no.
As the semantic relationsbetween the two nouns in the noun phrase are not madeexplicit, the interpretation of the phrases dependsmainly on the semantic characteristics of the nouns.This paper describes the semantic diversity of A no Band a method of semantic analysis for such phrasesbased on feature unification.1.
IntroductionJapanese has many noun phrase patterns of thetype A no B.
The noun phrase pattern, which consistsof two nouns A and B with an adnominal particle no,and which has at least the same ambiguity as B of A(and some additional ambiguities not found with theequivalent English construction), does not express anyexplicit semantic relations between the two nouns.Consequently, its interpretation depends mainly onthe semantic characteristics of the nouns.
Further-more, phrase patterns NI no N2 no ... no Nn  oftenappear.
Because the number of possible dependenciesbetween the constituents is 2 "'I (2n-3)l!
/ n!, semanticanalysis of such phrases is necessary to resolve theambiguities.
To date, there have been no adequateanalyses for this linguistic phenomenon, nor havethere been any clear methodological proposals for itssemantic analysis.This paper describes a) the semantic diversity of Ano B, b) the analysis of the semantic structure for A noB by a unification-based method of semantic functionapplication, c) typical semantic structures of A no B, d)the possibility of paraphrasing A no B as a noun phrasewith a relative clause by the addition of a verb, and e)the resolution of ambiguities using contextual informa-tion from the viewpoint of relation between A no B andits corresponding relative clause.Although A no B is a simple fo~n, it is interestingin two respects.
First, A no B represents a generallinguistic problem for semantic processing.
The reasonis that, in some cases, A or B is a noun form derivedfrom a verb or adjective, thus necessitating the seman-tic processing of verbs and adjectives.
Second, A no Bcan be paraphrased as a noun phrase with a relativeclause, in just the same way as some English complexnominals \[3, 5\].
Putt ing it another way, as informationis condensed into a simple expression, there areambiguities as to the semantic relations between thetwo nouns.
Consequently, contextual analysis plays acrucial part in the resolution of the ambiguities.2.
Semantic Diversity of A no BA no B is frequently found in Japanese sentences.An  exsmlnation of scientific and newspaper articlesshowed that the occurrence of A no B accounts for abouthalf the total number of noun phrases in a text ill\].
Theother occurrences are noun phrases with relativeclauses, and coordinated noun phrases.
In construc-tions of the type A no B, A or B can represent either asimple noun, as in Taroo no ie ("raro's house"), NP  ofthe same A no B pattern, as in kariforunia no shuto nojinko ("the population of the capital of California"), orNP  with a relative clause, as in Watashi ga atta hito nona ("the name of the person who I met").
There is also afourth pattern involving an additional particle such askara, made, de and so on, as in Tookyoo kara nodensha ("the train from Tokyo").
This paper dealsmainly with constructions of the first type, though themethod presented here is also applicable recursively topatterns of the second and third types: this is possiblebecause in such constructions, the semantic features ofA (i.e.
X no Y, or SY) derive from its head (Y).
In thefourth type, analysis is slightly less straightforward,because the particle does provide some additionaluseful information.A no modifies a head B to restrict or clarify thereferencetl.
21 of B.
In the example Sutanfoodo daigakuno kyooju ("professor at Stanford University"), Sutan-foodo daigaku ("Stanford University") restricts andclarifies the range of reference for kyooju ("professor").Such A no B constructions can be classified seman-tically into five main groups according to the character-istics of A and B, as shown in Table 1.
The five maingroups can be further classified into a total of about 80semantic relations.
In the study mentioned above \[III,the authors examined about ten thousand examples ofA no B occurrences, and checked the semantic relations.The appendix shows the semantic relations togetherwith examples.
It is necessary to analyze these seman-123Table I Five main groups by the semantic classi.qcation of A no B1.

To date, linguistic processinghas not entailed such a detailed classification.The semantic structure of A no B is generally afunction of the meanings of A and B, but the processingis not just a simple computation based on the semanticcontents of A and B.
For instance, when B functions asa predicate semantically, there is a case relationbetween A and B.
However, there are no syntacticclues such as a case particle, unlike in full sentences.Hence, it is necessary to consider the semanticcharacteristics of A and B in order to analyze thesemantic structure.Processing of context \[12\] is generally necessary todetermine the correct semantic structure of A no Buniquely, as A no B is often ambiguous if consideredout of context.
For instance, in the case of Ft~ransujinno hanashi ("speech of a Frenchman"), there are twopossible semantic relations for Furansuj in  ("French-man"): i.e.
as agent or content of hanashi ("speech").3.
Semantic Structure Analysis of A no B3.1 Analysis by Function ApplicationThe semantic structure of A no B is generallyanalyzed from A and B by "semant ic  functionapplication", which is similar to the idea of functionapplication in the CUG f ramework  (categorialunification grammar) 14. za\], viewing either A or B as afunctor, and the other as its argument.
(functor left/right) = (argument)(functor result) = (semantic-structure)F rom a different viewpoint, this is a generalization ofthe method of case frame analysis in which the analysisof the semantic structure of a verb-plus-noun phrase isbased on the case-frame of the verb.
That is, when averb as a functor is applied to a noun phrase as itsargument, if the noun phrase and a slot of the case-frame unify, the semantic structure is obtained as aresult of assigning the relevant information from thenoun phrase to the slot- So, the analysis is a kind ofsemant ic  t reatment using the unification-basedmethod.
In this view, the case frames correspond tosubcategorization frames, and the analysis correspondsto unifications applied to a subcategorization frame Is, s\]Characteristics of the function-based analysis aremainly to express input-output relations clearly, and toput stress on a lexical-based method.As  the meaning of A no B depends on the individualA and B, it follows that each lexical entry must  haveinformation regarding its "functionality".
This is alsothe method adopted in CUG.
Furthermore, thesefunctors, arguments, and resulting semantic structuresare represented as sets of at1~ribute-value pairs, againas in CUG.
This is also similar to frame representa-tions found in AI.
The set of attribute-value pairsassociated with a functor noun and an argument nounare generally represented as in Figure 1, and will becalled a "semantic structure".
The characteristics ofthese structures are described in Section 3.3.
In therepresentation, the attributes left and right indicatean argument for a functor word and a position (direc-tion), and the values represent conditions imposed onthe argument.
Syncat, semcat  and sense indicate syn-tactic, semantic and head word meaning respectively.Marker  indicates the case particle found as a post-posi-tion with the noun phrase.

Therefore, A no B is composed of Ano and B by the function role of either A no or B. Whichof A no or B has a function role depends on syntacticand semantic characteristic as described in section 3.3.Then A no is regarded as being constructed from A andno.
Accordingly, the semantic structure of A no B isanalyzed as follows: First, the functor no gets argu-ment  A, and makes  a noun phrase A no with thesemantic characteristics inherited from A. Secondly,the functor A no or B gets an argument B or A norespectively and makes a noun phrase A no B with thesemantic characteristics inherited from B.
The analy-sis process is shown as follows.
(1) functor: no, argument: A, result: Ano(2) functor: Ano, argument: B, result: AnoB,  orfunctor: B, argument: Ano, result: AnoBIn the case of A p no B (where p is an additional par-ticle), A and p are combined first.
The semantic struc-ture of A p is almost the same as that of A no except forthe additional information derived from the marker p.After this, the final semantic structure is composed inthe same way as for A no B.
This paper focuses mainlyon the analysis process after constituents of A no Bhave been found, and does not pay specific attention tothe method of how constituents are found, for whichpurpose the active chart parsing method is used.With regard to the composition of A no, we take thechoice giving no the functor role from the viewpoint ofgenerality, although it is possible to view A as havingthis role.
No has a functor role that shifts character-istics and functions of A to the semantic structure of Ano, and adds a marker feature to the semantic structureof A no.
The representation of no is shown in Figure 2.In the analysis of A no B, the semantic characteris-tics and functions of A and B weigh heavily, becausealthough there is an adnominal case particle no, it issemantically rather neutral compared with other caseparticles.
To put it another way, case particles usuallyfunction as explicit indicators of the preferred semanticinterpretation.
This fact suggests the significance ofstudying the method of analysis of A no B.When A no has a functor role, the functor must get Bas its a rgument  and extract a semantic relationbetween A and B.
For example, in guruupu no shuukai("meeting of a group"), guruupu no modifies an actionnominal  and makes  a result semantic structureindicating the semantic relation (agent) as in Figure 3.In the representation >pred  indicates a constraintthat an argument must  have a pred feature.The main semantic category of A no B is generallytaken from the head B of A no" B.
However, in somecases the semantics of B are different from those of A noB, and it is necessary to change the semantic cate-syncat: psense: no(c), no)left: syncat: {n np}semcat: \[\]sense: \[\]marker: noleft: NONEright: \[\]result: \[\]right: NONEresult: syncat: npsemcat: (left semcat)sense: (left sense)marker: noleft: NONEright: (left right)result: (left result)Figure 2syncat:semcat:sense:left:right:result:Figure 3aSemantic structure of a particle nonanimateguruupu ( ~" ~t~ - - f  , group)NONEsyncat:semcat:sense:> pred:{np n}\[\]\[\]\[\]: syncat:semcat:sense:np(right semcat)(right sense)(right pred)syncat:semcat:sense:pred:npanimate(sense)Semantic structure of gruupu ("group"\]125syncat~semcat:sense:marker.leftright:result:Figure 3bnploc?

For example, heita," ("soldier") is animate, butoraocka no heitai ("toy soldier") is not.
ThereforeomocAa no has the function of changing the semanticcategory of the head which it modifies.
Such a functionis obtained by a kind of overwriting unification 19!3.3 Semantic Structures in Five Main GroupsThe characteristics of the semantic structures in thef~ve ma/n groups are as follows.\[Case 1\] In this case, B, which is the nominal form ofa predicate (a verb or an adjective), functions as anar~ument~ and A, which is a semantic ase argumentof B, functions as a functor.
Notice that when Bfunctions semantically as a predicate, there are twoalternatives for the assignment of the functor role.
Thefirst is that the predicate word functions as the functor.The second is the reverse L41.
This paper adopts thelatter way mainly because of the characteristic of freeword order in a Japanese sentence.The semantic structure of A and A rw is almost thesame except for a marker feature, and has the followingfunctor role: when A no is an obligatory case (argu-ment) of the predicate B, A no unifies with theargument feature of" B.
When A no is an optional case(adjunct), the semantic structure of A no is added tothat of B as an optional case by unification.
The functorrole is added to A by a kind of lexical rule.
Ez~mplesare shown in Figures 3 and 4.\[Case 2and Case 3\] In these cases, B represents akind of case role or attr ibute respectively, whichfunctions as a predicate.
So, functionality is given to Ain the same way as described above.
Examples areshown in Figures 5 and 6.\[Case 4\] The reverse case of Case 1, that is, A is thenominal Form of" a predicate, and B is the semantic aseelement of the predicate.
So B is a functor and A no isits argument in the reverse way.
The example is shownin Figure 7.
Kooen ("park") in the example gets anargument in the opposite direction to that of example 4.The phrase in this case corresponds to a noun phrasewith a relative clause.
So, a feature embedded is usedin the representation, that is, it means that the predfeature is introduced from the complement.\[Case 5\] Semantic relations in this case are classifiedmainly into three types : a) relational restriction suchas a human relation, b) attributive restrict/on such as akind relation and c) situational restriction such as alocation relation.
(a) relational restr/ction: This case includes the rela-tionships between humans, organizations, and whole-part relations.
Generally a predicate role is given to Band a functor ole is given to A in the same way as Case1.
An example is shown in Figure 8.
In the example,sensei ("teacher") has a pred feature and is an argu-ment of the functor watasA~ ('I").
(b) attributive restriction: A has attributive character-istics such as quantity, kind, degree, and property, andB is generally a thing.
As A functions as a kind of pred- "icate, a predicate feature is assigned to A.
An exampleis shown in Figure 9 with kooshifima r~o n,,no Ccheck-ered-pattern cloth"), where kooshijurna has a pred fea-ture and is an argument of the functor ~,,no ("cloth").
(c) situational restriction: A has situational meaningssuch as location, time, source, destination, purpose, andmethod, and restricts B by the situation.
Like therelational restriction case, B is assigned a predicatefeature, and A a functor ole as shown in Figure 10.
Inthe example, doozoo ("oronze statue") has a pred fea-ture and is an argument of the functor kooen ("park").126Akira SHIMAZUsyncat:semcat:sense:marker:left~right:result:Figure 4asyncat:semcat:sense:pred:Figure 4bnlockooen (~ \[~, park)\[\]NONEsyncat: {n rip v vp}semcat: \[\]sense: \[\]right: \[\]> pred: Io?

Therefore, A or B generally has both rolesof a predicate and  a modifier.b) When there are several no's in a noun phase such assyncat:semcat:sense:pred:Figure 6npattributetakasa ( ~ ~, height)rel: haveobject: syncat: npsemcat: animatesense: yama (ILl, mountain)case: subjdefault-marker: gamarker: noattribute: syncat: " (np)semcat: (semcat)sense: (sense)case: objdefault-marker: omarker.

Thus, the middle noun (B) may relate tothe words on either side (A and C), or to only the right-hand word (C).
In the ~rst case, the middle noun maybe an argument of the predicate on both sides.
In thelatter case, the right,hOSt word C may be an argtunentof each predicate to the left, the number of which is notin general restricted.c) There are two cases of (A no (B no C)).
When C is anominal predicate, A and B might be separatearg~nents as in Kinoo  no Taroo no Sanpo ("raro's walkof yesterday").
When C is an ordinary noun, however,the analysis is further complicated by the fact thatimplicit predicates such as location, possession,attribution etc., are involved, For example, inTookyoo no NTT  no biru ('~rrr's building in Tokyo"),the inner predicate structure for NTT no bits ("NTThas a building") is attached to the appropriateargument of the outer predicate Tookyoo no biruCbuilding is in Tokyo").From the characteristics described above and themethod for assigning a functor role to an axg~nent of apredicate, we adopt the method that a funcmr role isadded to a constituent by a kind of lexical rule beforefunction application.
In general, several candidateconstituents are made by ~he feature structure pre-formation.
For example, at the stage ofAnoB - Ano  B,when B is a functor and has a meaning such as location,time and so on, two solutions for B are offered ascandidates: one as an argument of Ano,  which worksas a predicate, and the other as an adjunct.4 Correspondence between A no  B andthe Sentence4.1 Paraphrase  o f  A no B as  a Noun Phrasew i th  a Re la t ive  C lauseThe expression A no B can be paraphrased into A pV B or A '  B, adding an appropriate particle p andverb / adjective V, or reforming A to a verbal form A'  ifappropriate.
Both A p V and A '  are relative clauses.The paraphrased expression is more informative andsome of the ambiguity is resolved.
Paraphrases ofA noB in Case 1 - Case 4 are rather easy, as addedverbs/adjectives do not depend so much on context ascompared with Case 5.
Noun phrases with a relativeclause for each case in the A no B classification areshown in Table 2.Such paraphrases are obtained by a change from averb-centered to a noun-centered view.
A no B is gener-ally related to some event or state in a discourse, andthe event or state is represented by an appropriatepredicate: pred(A, B).
By taking a noun-centered view,the representation is transferred into a representationA \[pred(A(*), B)\], that is, A in pred(A, B).The expression that gives the corresponding predi-cate is taken from the value of the pred attribute in thesemantic structure.
A noun phrase paraphrased with arelative clause is generally constructed as follows: 1)the head B is put first, 2) a verb is chosen based on therel attribute, and put to the left orB, 3) a noun phrasecorresponding to the appropriate case role as given bythe argument structure of the predicate, is constructedfrom A and the particle indicated by a default-marker.and put to the left of the verb.
For instance, in zoo noomosa ("weight of an elephant"), first, the head omosais taken; second, verb rnotsu ("nave") is taken from avalue of rel, and put to the left of omosa; third, theagent zoo ga ("elephant") is put to the left of omosa.
Inthis way, the desired complex noun phrase zoo ga motsuomosa ("weight hat an elephant has") is arrived at.4.2 On Disambiguation by Contextual InformationAlthough A no B is semantically ambiguous, it cangenerally be disambiguated by contextual information.Although inferences including association and analogyare generally necessary, this paper briefly mentions thepossibility of the disambiguation method by unification128Table 2 Noun phrase with a relative clause for each case in the Ano B classification\[Case1\] ..* ApVBp: ga / o / de / ni (case particles),V: suru ("do") I ohonau ("do") / okoru ("happen")hare no hehhon ("his marriage") -~bare ga suru kehkon ('marriage that he performs")\[Case2\] --, A p V Bp: ga / o (case particles),V: aru ("be') / suru ('do") / shita ('done")/e no ma~ ('front of a house") --*iegaaru mae ("front of a place where a house is')\[Case3\] -* A ga motsu B ("B which has A")ishi no omosa ('weight of a stone") --*ishi ga motsu omosa ("weight which a stone has')\[Case4\] -* A o suruB ("B'whichdoA")sanpo no hito ("person who strolls") -~sanpo o suru hito ("person who strolls")\[CaseS\] ~ ApVBp: n.i I ga I ham / no tame ni (particles),V: aru ("be in") / motsu ( 'have') / tsuhurareru ("be made') /ohosu ("cause")~oen o doozoo ("statue in a park") -bhoo~n ni aru doozoo ("statue which is in a park')between a predicate structure in A no B semanticstructure and the related event structure in thediscourse.
A sequence of related events is described ina discourse.
On  the other hand, the semantic structureis represented by an appropriate predicate feature.From these, the correct structure can be obtained byunifying an event semantic structure with a predicatefeature in A no B as follows.event-semantic-structure-in-context- pred-structure-in-semantic-structure-of-A no BHere, " - "  means that the left hand side unifieswith the right hand side.Ambiguities of A no B may result from amibiguitiesregarding the predicates that  could be added,ambiguities in the words themselves, or ambiguouscase relations.
The d isambiguat ion  process isillustrated below using an example in which the addedpredicates are ambiguous.
Generally, a verb-centeredsemantic structure is extracted from a sentence.
Forthe sentence,(sl) Hanako  wa kyonen e o k.aita.
('~Hanako painted a picture last year.
")the following semantic structure is obtained.
Thisrepresentation is simplified, showing only theinformation needed for the explanation.pred: \[reh paint agent: Hanako object: picture\]This semantic structure can be obtained also from thenoun-centered semantic structure as follows.picture\[pred: reh paint agent: Hanako object: picture(*)\]Next, let us assume that the sentence (s2) occurs in thecontext of (sl).
(s2) Hanako  no e wa tenrankai de yuushoo shita.
("The picture of Hanako/Hanako's picturewon the first prize in an exhibition.
")Hanako  no e ("the picture of Hanako" or "Hanako'spicture") is ambiguous when taken out of context, witha range of possible semantic relations includingpossession, purchase, producer, and content.However, the ambiguity is resolved by unifying thesemantic structure of the previous sentence with eachof the semantic structures representing the possiblesemantic relations: the only semantic structure whichcan be successfully unified has the producer relation.5.
RemarksThis research concerns semantic structures,especially those of noun phrases, and was conducted aspart of a series of research efforts in the LUTE(Language Understander, Translator, & Editor) project\[e, 7.
I0, nl To date, ten thousand examples of A no Bhave been collected from scientific and newspaperarticles, and the appropriateness of the classification ofA no B investigated.
In addition, as a preliminaryexperiment, a semantic relation analysis was triedwith about a thousand examples, with rathersatisfactory results.
The mean ing  of A no B isgenerally ambiguous, and contextual information isneeded to resolve the ambiguities.
There seems to bevariety of such ambiguities relating to contextualinformation, but in principle such ambiguities areconsidered to be resolved by assuming appropriatepredicates as described in this paper.Acknowledgment  The authors wish to thankDr.
