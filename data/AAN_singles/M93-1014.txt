NEC :DESCRIPTION OF THE VENIEX SYSTE MAS USED FOR MUC- 5Kazunori MURAKI, Shinichi DOI and Shinichi ANDONEC Corp. Information Technology Research LaboratoriesHuman Language Research Laborator y4?1?1, Miyazaki, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki 216, JAPA NE-mail : {k-muraki, doi, ando}@hum .cl .nec.co.jpPhone: +81?44?856?2148, Fax: +81?44?856?2238INTRODUCTIONNEC Corporation has had years of experience in natural language processing and machine translation[l ,2, 3, 4, 5], and currently markets commercial natural language processing systems .
Utilizing dictionariesand parsing engines we have already had, we have developed the VENIEX System (VENus for Informa-tion EXtraction) as used for MUC-5 in only three months.
Our method is to apply both domain-specifickeyword-based analysis and full sentential parsing with general grammar[6, 7] .
The keyword dictionary o fVENIEX contains about thirty thousand entries, whose semantic structures are sub..ME_Capability frame ,and the parsing and discourse processing are controlled with the information given in this semantic struc-ture of keywords.
The resulting scores of VENIEX for formal run *texts were from 0 .7181(minimum) t o0 .7548(maximum) in Richness-Normalized Error and 48 .33 in F-MEASURES(P&R) .SYSTEM ARCHITECTUREThe overall system architecture is shown in Fig.
1 .
An input text is divided into sentences and eac hsentence is processed separately.
ME_Capability frames are extracted from each sentence .
An example ofthe procedure of information extraction from one sentence by VENIEX is shown in Fig .
2-4 .The characteristic modules of VENIEX are as follows :?
Keyword Dictionary which contains about thirty thousand entries, whose semantic structures ar esub_ ME_Capability frame ,?
Parser which generates ME_Capability frames by correlating keywords during full sentential parsing ,whose process is controlled with the information in this semantic structure of keywords ,?
Discourse Processor which combines MECapability frames of each sentence .We call this lexical-information-driven method for parsing and discourse processing "Lexical-Discourse-Parsing".
This method utilizes the merits of both domain-specific keyword-based analysis and full sententialparsing and discourse processing with general grammar.
It also reduces expenses of general parsing anddiscourse processing.PreprocessorThis module divides an input text into a header and a body of the text, and stores the document number ,date and source information from the header for entry into the template .
It also divides the body of the textinto sentences, which will be processed separately during morphological analysis and parsing .147(Input: Tipster text ), - ; .. .. .

+i'( Output : templa..e-")-Figure 1 : System Architecture of VENIE XDictionariesOur system utilizes two dictionaries, a syntactic dictionary and a keyword dictionary.
Both dictionariesare converted from the machine translation dictionaries we had developed .
The syntactic dictionary contain sabout ninety thousand entries and the keyword dictionary contains about thirty thousand entries, includin gthe names of corporations, pieces of equipment, devices, place names, etc.
Also, we extracted the names wedidn't have in our original dictionaries from the Tipster corpus, and enlarged the keyword dictionary .We added semantic structures which are sub_ME_Capability frame -partial structure of ME_Capabilityframe- to the entries of the keyword dictionary.
Examples of the sub-frames are shown in Fig .
2 .Fig.2-a) is an example of an Entity sub-frame, which provides slots for a name and a type of an entity.This sub-frame can provide other-name-slot whose value is a list of other names of the entity includingnicknames and abbreviations, such as "NEC" and " E " of " 8 *It% ".Fig.2-b) is an example of a ME_Capability sub-frame, which provides slots for the process type an ddetailed information of the process including its type and the equipment used .
The words to which aME_Capability sub-frame is added are extracted from technical term dictionaries of microelectronics and th eTipster corpus .Fig.2-c) is an example of a Relation sub-frame, which is added to words representing the relation betwee nwords with an Entity sub-frame and words with a ME_Capability sub-frame .
These sorts of words are gener-ally Japanese verbs .
The Relation sub-frame provides case slots with a case marker -Japanese postpositiona lparticles- representing grammatical relations .
Each case slot contains a sub-slot representing whether thefiller of this case slot is a word with an Entity sub-frame or a word with a ME_Capability sub-frame .

(manufac-turer)", " kk4 (distributor)" or "J k/ 11~ (purchaser_or_user)" .
Therefore, the Relation sub-frame inFig .2-c) means that :?
The Japanese verb " l (manufacture)" has two case slots .?
The filler of the first slot with a subject marker " 7r" is a word with an Entity sub-frame, whose roleto a ME_Capability sub-frame is " *AZ' (manufacturer)" .?
The filler of the second slot with an object marker " " is a word with a ME_Capability sub-frame .Morphological AnalyzerThis module divides input sentences into morphemes and gives every morpheme lexical attributes witha syntactic dictionary and a keyword dictionary.
For example, an input sentence " R *Acs Ofr CVDI?.1~ 6 0 (Nihon?shinkuu?gijutsu manufactures a piece of CVD-equipment.)"
is divided as shown inFig.
3, and the semantic structures shown in Fig.
2 are given to morphemes " 5 * I!#5t$T ", "CVD fib "and "IS " .If a morpheme is encountered that doesn't exist in the dictionaries, it is marked as an unknown wor dand its part of speech is estimated from neighboring morphemes .
For example, in a text that containsmany nouns, the recognition of unknown words becomes an important function because these words ma ybe important proper nouns .
Numerical values are also tagged with the same kinds of information as word sbecause they often perform as content words, and are often useful for determining sentence structures .Local ParserThis module re-collects morphemes given by the Morphological Analyzer and produces phrases.
Italso combines the ME_Capability sub-frames given to the words in a phrase, and assigns a new combine dME_Capability sub-frame to the output phrase .This module also deduces keywords from particular suffixes and patterns .
For example, the nouns pre -ceding the suffix "it " or " .t4? "
is considered as business entities .
Unknown noun preceding parenthese sinserted a place name can be business entities, too .150Sentence StructureICVD f Y .
oEntityME_Capability Relatio nME_Capability Fram eFigure 4: Example of Information Extractio nParserThis module re-collects phrases produced by Local Parser and outputs parse trees and semantic structures ,which are ME_Capability frames .
Its function involves not only parsing but also semantic interpretation ,lexical disambiguation and information extraction.
The main body of the analyzer is a unification-base dchart parser, and the parsing strategy is bottom-up breadth-first.
The solution with the highest preferenc escore is selected.
Our Local Parser and Discourse Processor are based on the same parsing engine and diffe ronly in parsing rules.
Sharing engines and functions by modules, we can efficiently develop the VENIEXsystem .The Parser can handle a wide variety of complex sentences .
It analyzes and generates modifying con-nections between phrases and the relation between keywords .
It constructs semantic structures which ar eME_Capability frames from sub-frames described in a keyword dictionary by correlating keywords duringfull sentential parsing, whose process is controlled with the information in the sub-frames .
For example, asillustrated in Fig.
4, the Parser recognizes the structure of the sentence " B *X=#i*>3 t CVD l~'k l $Z . "
and constructs a ME_Capability frame from sub-frames shown in Fig .
2 .This module can also deduce keywords.
If an unknown noun fills a Relation sub-frame's case slot whosefiller must be a word with an Entity sub-frame, this noun can be considered as an entity.In addition, the Parser recognizes special expressions whose sub_ME_Capability frames are used for dis-course processing .
It selects the most important Entity sub-frame and the ME-Capability sub-frame, an dalso analyzes the Entity sub-frame and the ME_Capability sub-frame represented by anaphoric expressions .~-f usirk I:7 .1=,f ?

We will later show examples of these slots with a walkthrough example .Though it is not illustrated in Fig .
1, VENIEX has another module as a fail-safe system between the Parse rand the Discourse Processor.
If the Parser cannot analyze an input sentence and outputs only fragments ofME_Capability frame, this Postparser module re-collects and combines the fragments without consideringthe sentence structure .Discourse ProcessorThis module combines ME_Capability frames generated by the Parser into frames representing content ofthe whole article .
It recognizes relation among the ME_Capability frames by resolving co-reference for entitiesand microelectronics .
The co-reference resolution is achieved by unifying "currentEnt" with "anaphorEnt "and unifying "currentME" with "anphorME".
VENIEX can resolve co-reference represented by a wide vari-ety of expressions : anaphoric expression (identical and unidentical), cleft sentence, ellipsis, name of Entities ,etc[7] .
We will later show an example of this process with a walkthrough example as well .Template Generato rIn VENIEX, the outputs of the Discourse Processor are ME_Capability frames.
In other words, essentialinformation has already been extracted during morphological, syntactic and discourse analysis.
All thatremains is to transform the frames and the information of the input article stored by the Preprocessor tothe output templates in the official form .PROCESSING WALKTHROUGH TEX TOverviewVENIEX has two steps for ME information extraction; 1) extracting ME_Capability frames separatelyfrom each sentence, 2) combining the frames above into frames representing content of the whole text .
Thismethod has two tasks in constructing a body of knowledge with small pieces of information contained inmore than one sentence .
First, it must construct new information with pieces of partial information scattere din different sentences .
Second, it must identify identical information represented by different expressions .VENIEX attains these tasks by discourse processing on surface expressions focused on ellipsis, anaphor aand so on .
The walkthrough text, however, has discourse problems that can't be solved with that particula rsurface process.
Therefore VENIEX can't merge the information sufficiently and outputs two ME object sfor only one ME object in the text.
Also, VENIEX fails in complement of ellipsis and extracts only on eentity for two entities.
As a result, the evaluation of walkthrough text is 66.67 P&R.Morphological Analyze rThe Morphological Analyzer divides a sentence into morphemes and assigns corresponding syntactic in-formation to each morpheme using the syntactic dictionary.
At the same time, it assigns some informationfrom the keyword dictionary to morphemes .Fig.
5 below shows the result of morphological analysis of the 1st sentence of the walkthrough ./*4'W /MA{key Ii {slot ['WWI) {csh ~+t ; ckey' 5 4 4 ?

The result of morphological analysis ?The notation "/" in Fig .
5 is a delimiter of two morphemes.
A morpheme recognized as a keywordis followed by a corresponding sub_ME_Capability frame, which is a partial structure of ME_Capabilityframe, loaded from the keyword dictionary.
For example the word " *A'' , which means "manufacturing" ,has information that the entity which appears as the subject plays a manufacturer part of the object, th eME_Capability frame.
The word " 8 *AM* ", which is a company name, has information that the typeis company.
The word " *Xli C V D ((t*71l*l ) ", which means "CVD equipment", conveysinformation that the type is layering and that the film is metal, and implies the existence of equipment .VENIEX gathers the sub_ME_Capability frames and combines them into the ME_Capability frames .Local ParserThe Local Parser recognizes a Japanese phrase by utilizing local patterns and the syntactic informatio ngiven by the Morphological Analyzer .
The Local Parser combines sub_ME_Capability frames in one phrase .The way of combination differs according to the sort of keywords ; " s :/ T 4 t 4 -- " (entity), " 4f n S-I .153L P' l q 4 .z gg " (microelectronics), " BM " (relationship) and so on.The output of the Morphological Analyzer is shown in Fig .

The result of parsing ?In the 1st sentence (No .
00), for example, manufacture and distribution on the CVD equipment isextracted.
The sentence consists of two simple sentences and the extracted information lies in the 2nd simplesentence.
VENIEX recognizes that these two simple sentences share the nominative case, and combines th eME_Capability frames according to the path of information ;{"Q*As#0 "_" rlLt0 "-{"tZ" - "CVD E "}}({Entity ?
"agree" ?
{"manufacture and distribute" ?
Equipment}}) .This results in VENIEX extracting the ME_Capability frame, as shown in Fig .
7 .The Parser in VENIEX extracts 5 ME_Capability frames from 4 sentences ; the 1st sentence, the 2nd sen-tence (No .
01), the 6th sentence (No .
05) and the 7th sentence (No .
06) .
As for the 6th sentence, VENIEXsucceed in extracting 2 ME_Capability frames from the noun phrase, " 8 *A # Miff Frig ?
Pkn L Tto 3 C JtJ CVD", and an entire of sentence .Meanwhile, the Parser keeps a sub_ME_Capability frame, which appears as an entity or microelec-tronics in the sentence, respectively in "entities" slot and "currentME" slot .
Additionally, for an entity(sub_ME_Capability frame), which is the subjective case in the given sentence, the Parser keeps it in "cur-rentEnt" slot .
For a sub_ME_Capability frame represented by anaphoric expressions, the Parser also instan -tiates "anaphorEnt" slot or "anaphorME"slot .
After anaphora resolution, it puts referred "currentEnt" slo tor "currentME" slot in corresponding "anaphorEnt" slot or "anaphorME"slot .Discourse ProcessorThe Discourse Processor merges ME_Capability frames the Parser output by utilizing "entities" slot ,"currentEnt" slot, "currentME" slot, "anaphorEnt" slot and "anaphorME" slot.
For example, the 2nd sen-tence in the walkthrough carries information that the entity " *As 'J " distributes some equipmentand the equipment which appears in anaphoric expression " Jiff " refers to the CVD equipment in the1st sentence .
In processing the 2nd sentence, the Discourse Processor recognizes the expression " fit "as an anaphoric expression and instantiates the "anaphorME" while extracting sub_ME_Capability frame(see Fig .
7) .
It checks consistency between the "anaphorME" slot and the "currentME" slot instantiated inprocessing the previous sentence and identifies these as the same object .VENIEX makes two mistakes in discourse processing for walkthrough text .One appears in ellipsis processing .
Ellipsis of nominative in the 6th sentence must be resolved for ex-tracting the entity which is the distributor .
The distributor entity must be "BTU 7 )t'!< i 4 " in the 3rdsentence because it is clear, according to context, that the 2nd paragraph is written about its activities.
ButVENIEX selects "currentEnt" slot which is the nominative of the 2nd sentence, because it lacks knowledg eto process a paragraph or joint venture .The other mistake is caused by failure in merging ME_Capability frame in the 1st paragraph with one i nthe 2nd paragraph .
These frames must be identical objects because the topic of the article is a joint venture ,and a joint venture distributes often products of parent company .'
(We think, however, that the equivalenceof the CVD equipment cannot be decided based only on these clues, and it is possible to interpret that thi sequipment are different .)
VENIEX processes all ME objects separately when there is no specified referentia l156expression .As a result, VENIEX output the template shown in Fig .

We have im-proved the system a little after the formal run -only by debugging parsing rules, not by adding new rulesand/or dictionaries-, and the current scores of VENIEX for formal run texts are from 0.7181(minimum )to 0.7548(maximum) in Richness-Normalized Error and 48 .33 in F-MEASURES(P&R), which are shown inTable 2.
The current scores for dry run texts are also shown in Table 3.Though we have developed the VENIEX System in only three months, there wasn't so much differencein scores with other systems in MUG-5 .
But the scores were lower than we had expected.
The main reaso nis the lowness of recall rate .
We didn't have enough time to collect keywords, especially verbs representin gthe relations between entities and microelectronics .We have developed many new functions for the MUG5 system, such as co-reference resolution and key-word deduction .
We have been evaluating these functions separately to judge weather they worked as w edesigned .
For example, to evaluate the performance of keyword deduction function in the Local Parser andthe Parser, we made an information extraction experiment without dictionaries of entities .

The result says that this function works well.
Throughthe development of VENIEX system for MUG-5, we have learned that we can realize information extractio nsystem with our natural language processing techniques .
But to improve the system, we must make moredetailed evaluation of performance of each function .One of the biggest theme of future work is automated or semi-automated training of the system .
Weplan to develop a bootstrapping method to improve the system with iterating cycles of "refining system" -"evaluating the performance" .References[1] Muraki, K., "VENUS: Two-phase Machine Translation System", Future Generations Computer Sys-tems, 2, 198 6[2] Ichiyama, S., "Multi-lingual Machine Translation System", Office Equipment and Products, 18-131 ,August 1989[3] Okumura, A ., Muraki, K. and Akamine, S., "Multi-lingual Sentence Generation from the PIVOT inter -lingua", Proceedings of MT SUMMIT III, July 199 1[4] Doi, S., Muraki, K ., Kamei, S .
