This transfer learn-ing approach brings a clear performancegain over features based on the traditionalbag-of-visual-word approach.
Experimen-tal results are reported on the WordSim353and MEN semantic relatedness evaluationtasks.
We use visual features computed us-ing either ImageNet or ESP Game images.1 IntroductionRecent works have shown that multi-modal se-mantic representation models outperform uni-modal linguistic models on a variety of tasks, in-cluding modeling semantic relatedness and pre-dicting compositionality (Feng and Lapata, 2010;Leong and Mihalcea, 2011; Bruni et al., 2012;Roller and Schulte im Walde, 2013; Kiela et al.,2014).
These results were obtained by combin-ing linguistic feature representations with robustvisual features extracted from a set of images as-sociated with the concept in question.
This extrac-tion of visual features usually follows the popularcomputer vision approach consisting of comput-ing local features, such as SIFT features (Lowe,1999), and aggregating them as bags of visualwords (Sivic and Zisserman, 2003).Meanwhile, deep transfer learning techniqueshave gained considerable attention in the com-puter vision community.
First, a deep convolu-tional neural network (CNN) is trained on a large?This work was carried out while Douwe Kiela was anintern at Microsoft Research, New York.labeled dataset (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).
Theconvolutional layers are then used as mid-levelfeature extractors on a variety of computer vi-sion tasks (Oquab et al., 2014; Girshick et al.,2013; Zeiler and Fergus, 2013; Donahue et al.,2014).
Although transferring convolutional net-work features is not a new idea (Driancourt andBottou, 1990), the simultaneous availability oflarge datasets and cheap GPU co-processors hascontributed to the achievement of considerableperformance gains on a variety computer visionbenchmarks: ?SIFT and HOG descriptors pro-duced big performance gains a decade ago, andnow deep convolutional features are providing asimilar breakthrough?
(Razavian et al., 2014).This work reports on results obtained by usingCNN-extracted features in multi-modal semanticrepresentation models.
These results are interest-ing in several respects.
First, these superior fea-tures provide the opportunity to increase the per-formance gap achieved by augmenting linguisticfeatures with multi-modal features.
Second, thisincreased performance confirms that the multi-modal performance improvement results from theinformation contained in the images and not theinformation used to select which images to useto represent a concept.
Third, our evaluation re-veals an intriguing property of the CNN-extractedfeatures.
Finally, since we use the skip-gram ap-proach of Mikolov et al.
(2013) to generate ourlinguistic features, we believe that this work rep-resents the first approach to multimodal distribu-tional semantics that exclusively relies on deeplearning for both its linguistic and visual compo-nents.2 Related work2.1 Multi-Modal Distributional SemanticsMulti-modal models are motivated by parallelswith human concept acquisition.
Standard se-36mantic space models extract meanings solely fromlinguistic data, even though we know that hu-man semantic knowledge relies heavily on percep-tual information (Louwerse, 2011).
That is, thereexists substantial evidence that many conceptsare grounded in the perceptual system (Barsalou,2008).
One way to do this grounding in the contextof distributional semantics is to obtain represen-tations that combine information from linguisticcorpora with information from another modality,obtained from e.g.
property norming experiments(Silberer and Lapata, 2012; Roller and Schulte imWalde, 2013) or from processing and extractingfeatures from images (Feng and Lapata, 2010;Leong and Mihalcea, 2011; Bruni et al., 2012).This approach has met with quite some success(Bruni et al., 2014).2.2 Multi-modal Deep LearningOther examples that apply multi-modal deeplearning use restricted Boltzmann machines (Sri-vastava and Salakhutdinov, 2012; Feng et al.,2013), auto-encoders (Wu et al., 2013) or recur-sive neural networks (Socher et al., 2014).
Multi-modal models with deep learning componentshave also successfully been employed in cross-modal tasks (Lazaridou et al., 2014).
Work that isclosely related in spirit to ours is by Silberer andLapata (2014).
They use a stacked auto-encoderto learn combined embeddings of textual and vi-sual input.
Their visual inputs consist of vectorsof visual attributes obtained from learning SVMclassifiers on attribute prediction tasks.
In con-trast, our work keeps the modalities separate andfollows the standard multi-modal approach of con-catenating linguistic and visual representations ina single semantic space model.
This has the advan-tage that it allows for separate data sources for theindividual modalities.
We also learn visual repre-sentations directly from the images (i.e., we applydeep learning directly to the images), as opposedto taking a higher-level representation as a start-ing point.
Frome et al.
(2013) jointly learn multi-modal representations as well, but apply them toa visual object recognition task instead of conceptmeaning.2.3 Deep Convolutional Neural NetworksA flurry of recent results indicates that image de-scriptors extracted from deep convolutional neu-ral networks (CNNs) are very powerful and con-sistently outperform highly tuned state-of-the-artsystems on a variety of visual recognition tasks(Razavian et al., 2014).
Embeddings from state-of-the-art CNNs (such as Krizhevsky et al.
(2012))have been applied successfully to a number ofproblems in computer vision (Girshick et al.,2013; Zeiler and Fergus, 2013; Donahue et al.,2014).
This contribution follows the approach de-scribed by Oquab et al.
(2014): they train a CNNon 1512 ImageNet synsets (Deng et al., 2009),use the first seven layers of the trained network asfeature extractors on the Pascal VOC dataset, andachieve state-of-the-art performance on the PascalVOC classification task.3 Improving Multi-ModalRepresentationsFigure 1 illustrates how our system computesmulti-modal semantic representations.3.1 Perceptual RepresentationsThe perceptual component of standard multi-modal models that rely on visual data is oftenan instance of the bag-of-visual-words (BOVW)representation (Sivic and Zisserman, 2003).
Thisapproach takes a collection of images associatedwith words or tags representing the concept inquestion.
For each image, keypoints are laid outas a dense grid.
Each keypoint is represented bya vector of robust local visual features such asSIFT (Lowe, 1999), SURF (Bay et al., 2008) andHOG (Dalal and Triggs, 2005), as well as pyra-midal variants of these descriptors such as PHOW(Bosch et al., 2007).
These descriptors are sub-sequently clustered into a discrete set of ?visualwords?
using a standard clustering algorithm likek-means and quantized into vector representationsby comparing the local descriptors with the clustercentroids.
Visual representations are obtained bytaking the average of the BOVW vectors for theimages that correspond to a given word.
We useBOVW as a baseline.Our approach similarly makes use of a collec-tion of images associated with words or tags rep-resenting a particular concept.
Each image is pro-cessed by the first seven layers of the convolu-tional network defined by Krizhevsky et al.
(2012)and adapted by Oquab et al.

(2014).
This network was trained us-ing about 1.6 million ImageNet images associatedwith these 1512 categories.
We then freeze thetrained parameters, chop the last network layer,and use the remaining seventh layer as a filter tocompute a 6144-dimensional feature vector on ar-bitrary 224?
224 input images.We consider two ways to aggregate the featurevectors representing each image.1.
The first method (CNN-Mean) simply com-putes the average of all feature vectors.2.
The second method (CNN-Max) computesthe component-wise maximum of all featurevectors.
This approach makes sense becausethe feature vectors extracted from this par-ticular network are quite sparse (about 22%non-zero coefficients) and can be interpretedas bags of visual properties.3.2 Linguistic representationsFor our linguistic representations we extract 100-dimensional continuous vector representations us-ing the log-linear skip-gram model of Mikolovet al.
(2013) trained on a corpus consisting ofthe 400M word Text8 corpus of Wikipedia text2together with the 100M word British NationalCorpus (Leech et al., 1994).
We also experi-mented with dependency-based skip-grams (Levyand Goldberg, 2014) but this did not improve re-sults.
The skip-gram model learns high quality se-mantic representations based on the distributionalproperties of words in text, and outperforms stan-dard distributional models on a variety of semanticsimilarity and relatedness tasks.
However we notethat Bruni et al.
(2014) have recently reported aneven better performance for their linguistic com-ponent using a standard distributional model, al-though this may have been tuned to the task.3.3 Multi-modal RepresentationsFollowing Bruni et al.
(2014), we construct multi-modal semantic representations by concatenatingthe centered and L2-normalized linguistic and per-ceptual feature vectors ~vlingand ~vvis,~vconcept= ??
~vling|| (1?

~vvis, (1)where || denotes the concatenation operator and ?is an optional tuning parameter.2http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html38Figure 2: Examples of dog in the ESP Game dataset.Figure 3: Examples of golden retriever in ImageNet.4 Experimental SetupWe carried out experiments using visual repre-sentations computed using two canonical imagedatasets.
The resulting multi-modal concept rep-resentations were evaluated using two well-knownsemantic relatedness datasets.4.1 Visual DataWe carried out experiments using two distinctsources of images to compute the visual represen-tations.The ImageNet dataset (Deng et al., 2009) isa large-scale ontology of images organized ac-cording to the hierarchy of WordNet (Fellbaum,1999).
The dataset was constructed by manuallyre-labelling candidate images collected using websearches for each WordNet synset.
The imagestend to be of high quality with the designated ob-ject roughly centered in the image.
Our copy ofImageNet contains about 12.5 million images or-ganized in 22K synsets.
This implies that Ima-geNet covers only a small fraction of the existing117K WordNet synsets.The ESP Game dataset (Von Ahn and Dabbish,2004) was famously collected as a ?game witha purpose?, in which two players must indepen-dently and rapidly agree on a correct word labelfor randomly selected images.
Once a word labelhas been used sufficiently frequently for a givenimage, that word is added to the image?s tags.
Thisdataset contains 100K images, but with every im-age having on average 14 tags, that amounts to acoverage of 20,515 words.
Since players are en-couraged to produce as many terms per image, thedataset?s increased coverage is at the expense ofaccuracy in the word-to-image mapping: a dog ina field with a house in the background might be agolden retriever in ImageNet and could have tagsdog, golden retriever, grass, field, house, door inthe ESP Dataset.
In other words, images in theESP dataset do not make a distinction between ob-jects in the foreground and in the background, orbetween the relative size of the objects (tags forimages are provided in a random order, so the toptag is not necessarily the best one).Figures 2 and 3 show typical examples of im-ages belonging to these datasets.
Both datasetshave attractive properties.
On the one hand, Ima-geNet has higher quality images with better labels.On the other hand, the ESP dataset has an interest-ing coverage because the MEN task (see section4.4) was specifically designed to be covered by theESP dataset.4.2 Image SelectionSince ImageNet follows the WordNet hierarchy,we would have to include almost all images inthe dataset to obtain representations for high-levelconcepts such as entity, object and animal.
Doingso is both computationally expensive and unlikelyto improve the results.
For this reason, we ran-domly sample up to N distinct images from thesubtree associated with each concept.
When thisreturns less thanN images, we attempt to increasecoverage by sampling images from the subtree ofthe concept?s hypernym instead.
In order to allowfor a fair comparison, we apply the same methodof sampling up to N on the ESP Game dataset.
Inall following experiments, N = 1.000.
We usedthe WordNet lemmatizer from NLTK (Bird et al.,2009) to lemmatize tags and concept words so asto further improve the dataset?s coverage.4.3 Image ProcessingThe ImageNet images were preprocessed as de-scribed by (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).
The largestcentered square contained in each image is resam-39pled to form a 256 ?
256 image.
The CNN inputis then formed by cropping 16 pixels off each bor-der and subtracting 128 to the image components.The ESP Game images were preprocessed slightlydifferently because we do not expect the objectsto be centered.
Each image was rescaled to fit in-side a 224?224 rectangle.
The CNN input is thenformed by centering this image into the 224?
224input field, subtracting 128 to the image compo-nents, and zero padding.The BOVW features were obtained by comput-ing DSIFT descriptors using VLFeat (Vedaldi andFulkerson, 2008).
These descriptors were subse-quently clustered using mini-batch k-means (Scul-ley, 2010) with 100 clusters.
Each image is thenrepresented by a bag of clusters (visual words)quantized as a 100-dimensional feature vector.These vectors were then combined into visual con-cept representations by taking their mean.4.4 EvaluationWe evaluate our multi-modal word representationsusing two semantic relatedness datasets widelyused in distributional semantics (Agirre et al.,2009; Feng and Lapata, 2010; Bruni et al., 2012;Kiela and Clark, 2014; Bruni et al., 2014).WordSim353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001) is a se-lection of 353 concept pairs with a similarity rat-ing provided by human annotators.
Since this isprobably the most widely used evaluation datasetfor distributional semantics, we include it for com-parison with other approaches.
WordSim353 hassome known idiosyncracies: it includes named en-tities, such as OPEC, Arafat, and Maradona, aswell as abstract words, such as antecedent andcredibility, for which it may be hard to find cor-responding images.
Multi-modal representationsare often evaluated on an unspecified subset ofWordSim353 (Feng and Lapata, 2010; Bruni etal., 2012; Bruni et al., 2014), making it impossi-ble to compare the reported scores.
In this work,we report scores on the full WordSim353 dataset(W353) by setting the visual vector ~vvisto zero forconcepts without images.
We also report scoreson the subset (W353-Relevant) of pairs for whichboth concepts have both ImageNet and ESP Gameimages using the aforementioned selection proce-dure.MEN (Bruni et al., 2012) was in part designedto alleviate the WordSim353 problems.
It was con-structed in such a way that only frequent wordswith at least 50 images in the ESP Game datasetwere included in the evaluation pairs.
The MENdataset has been found to mirror the aggregatescore over a variety of tasks and similarity datasets(Kiela and Clark, 2014).
It is also much larger,with 3000 words pairs consisting of 751 individualwords.
Although MEN was constructed so as tohave at least a minimum amount of images avail-able in the ESP Game dataset for each concept,this is not the case for ImageNet.
Hence, simi-larly to WordSim353, we also evaluate on a subset(MEN-Relevant) for which images are availablein both datasets.We evaluate the models in terms of their Spear-man ?
correlation with the human relatedness rat-ings.
The similarity between the representationsassociated with a pair of words is calculated usingthe cosine similarity:cos(v1, v2) =v1?
v2?v1?
?v2?
(2)5 ResultsWe evaluate on the two semantic relatednessdatasets using solely linguistic, solely visual andmulti-modal representations.
In the case of MEN-Relevant and W353-Relevant, we report scores forBOVW, CNN-Mean and CNN-Max visual repre-sentations.
For all datasets we report the scoresobtained by BOVW, CNN-Mean and CNN-Maxmulti-modal representations.
Since we have fullcoverage with the ESP Game dataset on MEN, weare able to report visual representation scores forthe entire dataset as well.
The results can be seenin Table 1.There are a number of questions to ask.
Firstof all, do CNNs yield better visual representa-tions?
Second, do CNNs yield better multi-modalrepresentations?
And third, is there a differencebetween the high-quality low-coverage ImageNetand the low-quality higher-coverage ESP Gamedataset representations?5.1 Visual RepresentationsIn all cases, CNN-generated visual representationsperform better or as good as BOVW representa-tions (we report results for BOVW-Mean, whichperforms slightly better than taking the element-wise maximum).
This confirms the motivationoutlined in the introduction: by applying state-of-the-art approaches from computer vision to multi-modal semantics, we obtain a signficant perfor-40Dataset Linguistic Visual Multi-modalBOVW CNN-Mean CNN-Max BOVW CNN-Mean CNN-MaxImageNet visual featuresMEN 0.64 - - - 0.64 0.70 0.67MEN-Relevant 0.62 0.40 0.64 0.63 0.64 0.72 0.71W353 0.57 - - - 0.58 0.59 0.60W353-Relevant 0.51 0.30 0.32 0.30 0.55 0.56 0.57ESP game visual featuresMEN 0.64 0.17 0.51 0.20 0.64 0.71 0.65MEN-Relevant 0.62 0.35 0.58 0.57 0.63 0.69 0.70W353 0.57 - - - 0.58 0.59 0.60W353-Relevant 0.51 0.38 0.44 0.56 0.52 0.55 0.61Table 1: Results (see sections 4 and 5).mance increase over standard multi-modal mod-els.5.2 Multi-modal RepresentationsHigher-quality perceptual input leads to better-performing multi-modal representations.
In allcases multi-modal models with CNNs outperformmulti-modal models with BOVW, occasionally byquite a margin.
In all cases, multi-modal rep-resentations outperform purely linguistic vectorsthat were obtained using a state-of-the-art system.This re-affirms the importance of multi-modal rep-resentations for distributional semantics.5.3 The Contribution of ImagesSince the ESP Game images come with a multi-tude of word labels, one could question whethera performance increase of multi-modal modelsbased on that dataset comes from the images them-selves, or from overlapping word labels.
It mightalso be possible that similar concepts are morelikely to occur in the same image, which encodesrelatedness information without necessarily tak-ing the image data itself into account.
In short,it is a natural question to ask whether the perfor-mance gain is due to image data or due to wordlabel associations?
We conclusively show that theimage data matters in two ways: (a) using a dif-ferent dataset (ImageNet) also results in a perfor-mance boost, and (b) using higher-quality imagefeatures on the ESP game images increases theperformance boost without changing the associa-tion between word labels.5.4 Image DatasetsIt is important to ask whether the source im-age dataset has a large impact on performance.Although the scores for the visual representa-tion in some cases differ, performance of multi-modal representations remains close for both im-age datasets.
This implies that our method is ro-bust over different datasets.
It also suggests that itis beneficial to train on high-quality datasets likeImageNet and to subsequently generate embed-dings for other sets of images like the ESP Gamedataset that are more noisy but have better cover-age.
The results show the benefit of transferingconvolutional network features, corroborating re-cent results in computer vision.5.5 Semantic Similarity/Relatedness DatasetsThere is an interesting discrepancy between thetwo types of network with respect to dataset per-formance: CNN-Mean multi-modal models tendto perform best on MEN and MEN-Relevant,while CNN-Max multi-modal models performbetter on W353 and W353-Relevant.
There alsoappears to be some interplay between the sourcecorpus, the evaluation dataset and the best per-forming CNN: the performance leap on W353-41Figure 4: Varying the ?
parameter for MEN, MEN-Relevant, WordSim353 and WordSim353-Relevant,respectively.Relevant for CNN-Max is much larger using ESPGame images than with ImageNet images.We speculate that this is because CNN-Max per-forms better than CNN-Mean on a somewhat dif-ferent type of similarity.
It has been noted (Agirreet al., 2009) that WordSim353 captures both sim-ilarity (as in tiger-cat, with a score of 7.35) aswell as relatedness (as in Maradona-football, witha score of 8.62).
MEN, however, is explicitly de-signed to capture semantic relatedness only (Bruniet al., 2012).
CNN-Max using sparse feature vec-tors means that we treat the dominant componentsas definitive of the concept class, which is moresuited to similarity.
CNN-Mean averages overall the feature components, and as such might bemore suited to relatedness.
We conjecture that theperformance increase on WordSim353 is due toincreased performance on the similarity subset ofthat dataset.5.6 TuningThe concatenation scheme in Equation 1 allowsfor a tuning parameter ?
to weight the relativecontribution of the respective modalities.
Previouswork on MEN has found that the optimal param-eter for that dataset is close to 0.5 (Bruni et al.,2014).
We have found that this is indeed the case.On WordSim353, however, we have found the pa-rameter for optimal performance to be shifted tothe right, meaning that optimal performance isachieved when we include less of the visual inputcompared to the linguistic input.
Figure 4 showswhat happens when we vary alpha over the fourdatasets.
There are a number of observations to bemade here.First of all, we can see that the performancepeak for the MEN datastes is much higher thanfor the WordSim353 ones, and that its peak is rel-atively higher as well.
This indicates that MEN isin a sense a more balanced dataset.
There are twopossible explanations: as indicated earlier, Word-Sim353 contains slightly idiosyncratic word pairswhich may have a detrimental effect on perfor-mance; or, WordSim353 was not constructed withmulti-modal semantics in mind, and contains asubstantial amount of abstract words that wouldnot benefit at all from including visual informa-tion.Due to the nature of the datasets and the tasksat hand, it is arguably much more important thatCNNs beat standard bag-of-visual-words repre-sentations on MEN than on W353, and indeed wesee that there exists no ?
for which BOVW wouldbeat any of the CNN networks.6 Error AnalysisTable 2 shows the top 5 best and top 5 worst scor-ing word pairs for the two datasets using CNN-42W353-RelevantImageNet ESP Gameword1 word2 system score gold standard word1 word2 system score gold standardtiger tiger 1.00 1.00 tiger tiger 1.00 1.00man governor 0.53 0.53 man governor 0.53 0.53stock phone 0.15 0.16 stock phone 0.15 0.16football tennis 0.68 0.66 football tennis 0.68 0.66man woman 0.85 0.83 man woman 0.85 0.83cell phone 0.27 0.78 law lawyer 0.33 0.84discovery space 0.10 0.63 monk slave 0.58 0.09closet clothes 0.22 0.80 gem jewel 0.41 0.90king queen 0.26 0.86 stock market 0.33 0.81wood forest 0.13 0.77 planet space 0.32 0.79MEN-RelevantImageNet ESP Gameword1 word2 system score gold standard word1 word2 system score gold standardbeef potatoes 0.35 0.35 beef potatoes 0.35 0.35art work 0.35 0.35 art work 0.35 0.35grass stop 0.06 0.06 grass stop 0.06 0.06shade tree 0.45 0.45 shade tree 0.45 0.45blonde rock 0.07 0.07 blonde rock 0.07 0.07bread potatoes 0.88 0.34 bread dessert 0.78 0.24fruit potatoes 0.80 0.26 jacket shirt 0.89 0.34dessert sandwich 0.76 0.23 fruit nuts 0.88 0.33pepper tomato 0.79 0.27 dinner lunch 0.93 0.37dessert tomato 0.66 0.14 dessert soup 0.81 0.23Table 2: The top 5 best and top 5 worst scoring pairs with respect to the gold standard.Mean multi-modal vectors.
The most accuratepairs are consistently the same across the two im-age datasets.
There are some clear differencesbetween the least accurate pairs, however.
TheMEN words potatoes and tomato probably havelow quality ImageNet-derived representations, be-cause they occur often in the bottom pairs for thatdataset.
The MEN words dessert, bread and fruitoccur in the bottom 5 for both image datasets,which implies that their linguistic representationsare probably not very good.
For WordSim353, thebottom pairs on ImageNet could be said to be sim-ilarity mistakes; while the ESP Game dataset con-tains more relatedness mistakes (king and queenwould evaluate similarity, while stock and marketwould evaluate relatedness).
It is difficult to sayanything conclusive about this discrepancy, but itis clearly a direction for future research.7 Image embeddingsTo facilitate further research on image embed-dings and multi-modal semantics, we publicly re-lease embeddings for all the image labels occur-ring in the ESP Game dataset.
Please see the fol-lowing web page: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/?dk427/imgembed.html8 ConclusionWe presented a novel approach to improvingmulti-modal representations using deep convo-lutional neural network-extracted features.
Wereported high results on two well-known andwidely-used semantic relatedness benchmarks,with increased performance both in the separatevisual representations and in the combined multi-modal representations.
Our results indicate thatsuch multi-modal representations outperform bothlinguistic and standard bag-of-visual-words multi-modal representations.
We have shown that ourapproach is robust and that CNN-extracted fea-tures from separate image datasets can succesfullybe applied to semantic relatedness.In addition to improving multi-modal represen-tations, we have shown that the source of this im-provement is due to image data and is not simply aresult of word label associations.
We have shownthis by obtaining performance improvements ontwo different image datasets, and by obtaining43higher performance with higher-quality image fea-tures on the ESP game images, without changingthe association between word labels.In future work, we will investigate whether oursystem can be further improved by including con-creteness information or a substitute metric suchas image dispersion, as has been suggested byother work on multi-modal semantics (Kiela et al.,2014).
Furthermore, a logical next step to increaseperformance would be to jointly learn multi-modalrepresentations or to learn weighting parameters.Another interesting possibility would be to exam-ine multi-modal distributional compositional se-mantics, where multi-modal representations arecomposed to obtain phrasal representations.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Maxime Oquab for pro-viding the feature extraction code.ReferencesEneko Agirre, Enrique Alfonseca, Keith Hall, JanaKravalova, Marius Pas?ca, and Aitor Soroa.
