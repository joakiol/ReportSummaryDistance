Segment-Based Acoustic Models with Multi-level Search Algorithms forContinuous Speech RecognitionMari Ostendorf J. Robin RohlicekBoston University BBN Inc.Objective:The goal of this project is to develop improved acoustic models for speaker-independent r cog-nition of continuous peech, together with efficient search algorithms appropriate for use withthese models.
The current work on acoustic modelling is focussed on stochastic, segment-basedmodels that capture the time correlation of a sequence of observations (feature vectors) thatcorrespond to a phoneme.
Since the use of segment models is computationally complex, wewill also investigate multi-level, iterative algorithms to achieve a more efficient search.
Fur-thermore, these algorithms will provide a formalism for incorporating higher-order information.This research is jointly sponsored by DARPA and NSF.Summary of Accomplishments:?
Investigated the effect on recognition performance of different parameters of the segmentmodel, particularly as a function of training.?
Developed a new approach to modeling time correlation in the context of the segmentmodel.Developed new fast approaches tophone recognition, motivated by algorithms from imagesegmentation, which offers significant computational dvantages over dynamic program-ming.?
Developed areformulation of hidden Markov models which allows for more general map-pings from the acoustic features to state likelihoods.?
Achieved recognition results on the TIM1T database using context-independent modelswhich are comparable to those reported by others using context-dependent models.Plans:?
Investigate dynamical system models for representing time correlation and context-dependencein the segment model.?
Extend current results to use segmental features and context-dependent models.?
Investigate mechanisms for integrating segment algorithms with the BBN Byblos recog-nition system.?
Investigate global constraints and features using multi-level algorithms.409
