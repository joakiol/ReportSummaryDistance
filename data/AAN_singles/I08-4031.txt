Twokinds of Challenges we confront are how toimprove the performance in one corpus andkeep its performance in another differentcorpus.
We use a combination of statisticalmodels, i.e.
a language model to recognizeperson names and two CRFs models torecognize Location names andOrganization names respectively.
We alsoincorporate an efficient heuristic namedentity list searching process into theframework of statistical model in order toimprove both the performance and theadaptability of the statistical NER system.We participate in the NER tests on opentracks of MSRA.
The testing results showthat our system can performs well.1 IntroductionNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is one of themost important tasks in NLP, and acts as a criticalrole in some language processing applications,such as Information Extraction and Integration,Text Classification etc.
Many efforts have beenpaid to improve the performance of NER.NER task in Chinese has some differences fromin English as follows.
1) There is no space betweenChinese characters, which make boundaryrecognition more difficult.
2) In English, acapitalized letter at the beginning position of aword implies that the word is a part of a namedentity.
However, this kind of characteristic doesnot exist in Chinese.In the paper, we will focus on two kinds ofproblems.
1) How to improve the performance ofChinese NER in one corpus, which containsboosting precision rate, recall rate and F-measurerate.
2) How to enhance the  adaptability of aChinese NER system, which means that a systemcan get a good performance on a testing set whichhas many differences from the training set.
Tosolve the first problem, we should select a goodmodel and adjust parameters carefully.
But there isno framework that can solve the second problemcompletely.Our goal is to find a way to solve these twoproblems.
We select a language model to recognizePerson names, and two CRFs models are used torecognize Location and Organization separately.We also try to incorporate a large-scale namedentity list into the statistical model, where aheuristic searching method is developed to matchthe entities in the list quickly and efficiently.2 Framework of NER SystemThe Input of the system is a raw text.
We willapply some pre-processing such as codetransformation.
Then the heuristic searching willbe executed to find the appearance of the entities inthe named entity list.
After that, two CRFs thathave been trained before will be used to recognizeLocation and Organization based on the result ofword segmentation, and a language model will beused to find Person names.
All the results will beintegrated at last.171Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language ProcessingFigure 1.
System Frameworks3 System Details3.1 Using heuristic method to search entitylistNER task meets many difficulties which comefrom the complexity of the construction of namedentities.
Named entities have flexible internalstyles and external environments.
Building a goodmodel to describe the condition precisely will havemany troubles.
The statistical models we common-ly used have some shortcomings, especially whenthey are adapted to a corpus of new domains orstyles.
We try to use an improved searchingmethod to make up the relatively poor adaptabilityof the statistical models.
The heuristic searchingmethod is more flexible especially in the followingtwo aspects.
1) Abbreviation can be matched.
2)Suffix in location and organization is universal, butit should not be taken in count when we searchnamed entities.The framework of the algorithm can be brieflydescribed as follows:1) Building an inverse index using Chinese charactersas key term;2) Using the text as a query to search for entities;3) When comes terminal condition, a heuristicfunction is invoked to determine whether thecharacter sequence is an entity;4) When comes creation condition, a heuristicfunction is invoked to judge whether a new entity iscreated;5) The labeled sequence is output.Table 1.
Heuristic Searching MethodOne advantage of heuristic searching method isthat the heuristic function can be set to fit a specialcorpus.
The heuristic searching method we used inBakeoff-4 is as follows:Un-segmenting testPerson recognitionHeuristic searchingLocationrecognitionOrganizationrecognitionWord segmentationOutput resultsz Ignoring the suffix key word in Location andOrganization names.
For example???
?
?/Tongfang /Corporation?
and???/Tongfang?
will get same score underthis heuristic rule.z Ignoring the Location name as a prefix in anOrganization name.
For example,??
?/Ameri ?
?can /General Motors ?
and??
?/General Motors?
will get same scoreunder this heuristic rulez Taking Abbreviation rules in consideration.For example???
?
?/Peking /University?can be abbreviated as ??
?/Bei /Da?
ratherthan ???/Peking?
or ??
?/University?Heuristic searching method also has such advan-tages as follows:It is easy to be expanded to a corpus of newdomain or style.
We only need to add the entitiesin the new domain into listSearching method will improve the recallperformance remarkablyBut the precision will be reduced for the ambi-guities, i.e.
whether a sequence that matches anentity in the list really constructs an entity in thetext.
We will disambiguate it using statisticalmodels.3.2 Conditional Random Fields ModelConditional Random Fields (CRFs) is anundirected graphical model that encodes aconditional probability distribution using a givenset of features.
Currently it is widely used as adiscriminate model for sequence labeling:1 211( | ) exp( ( , , ))ki i c cc C iP Y X f y y XZ??
== ??
(1)CRFs is considered to be a very effective modelto resolve the issue of sequence labeling for thefollowing characteristics:Because it uses a non-greedy whole sentencejoint labeling method, high accuracy rate can beguaranteed and bias labeling can be avoided.Any types of features can be integrated in themodel flexibly.Over-fitting can be avoided to some extent byintegrating a priori with training data.172Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language ProcessingAs a discriminate model, CRFs inherits theadvantages of both Hidden Markov Model (HMM)and Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM)as well.3.3 Person names recognizeWe use language model to recognize Personalnames.
We use character-based rather than word-based model to avoid the word segmentation errors.We construct a context model and an entity modelto respectively describe external and internalfeatures of Personal names.
The details of themodel are as follows:We use a tri-gram model as the context model:( ) ( )?

(3)Where B means the beginning of the entity, Mmeans middle, E means end.Some expert knowledge is employed to assistthe recognition process of language model.z A Chinese family name list (476) and aJapanese family name list (9189) are used torestrict and select the generated candidates.z A list of commonly used character in Russianand European name.z Constrain of name length: A Chinese namecannot contain more than 8 characters.3.4 Location names recognitionLocation names have some composition characters.1) There may be some key words as suffix, such as:?
?/Shi, ?/Zheng, ?/Hu, ?/Shan?
etc.
2) Otherparts of Location names are always OOV words,such as ???
?/Dagang Village, ???/FuziTemple?.
So the right boundary of Location canbe determined easily.
The mainly problem inLocation recognition is on abbreviation, such as?????/JinJiLuYu?
is the combination of fourlocation abbreviations.
In our system, CRFs modelcan be supported by the heuristic searching methodbecause it can match the abbreviation of entity inlist.
Using the searching method can boost therecall rate of location recognition significantly.
Weconstruct the recognition model based on the word-segmented texts.To construct a CRFs model, we select thefollowing features:z A list of key word suffix is used to trigger therecognition processing.z Using a list of indication words to restrict theboundary.z Heuristic searching method is used to assistLocation recognition.The features we used in CRFs model is followed:W0 Current WordW-1?W-2 , W1?W2 Two words before andbehindW-1W0?W0W1 Bi-gram FeaturesPOS0 POS tagPRE-1?PRE0?PRE1 Pre-Position referencewordsSRE-1?SRE0?SRE1 Suf-Position referencewordsKey Has Key suffixDIC In DictionaryTable 2.
Features used in Location recognitionStatement:The indication words used in Locationrecognition include ?for-indicate?
and ?back-indicate?
words, where ?for-indicate?
denotes theindicating words that occur as the left neighbor ofthe candidate Location named entity, while ?back-indicate?
denotes the indicating words that occuras the right neighbor.
?for-indicate?
and ?back-indicate?
words are got from the training corpus.We calculate the mutual information betweenneighbor words and location entity, and get the topN words as indication words.
( , )( , ) ( , ) log( ) ( )p x yMI x y p x yp x p y=     (4)We select 1216 for-indicate words and 1227back-indicate words.
We also get 607 key words aslocation name suffix.3.5 Organization names recognitionOrganization name recognition is the most difficultpart in NER task.
The difficulties are as follows.
1)The composition of Organization name is verycomplex.
For example: ???
?
?/Dalian /Shide?
?/Group?, the first words in the entity is alocation name.
The second is a phonetic name173Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processingwhich is also an OOV word and the last one is akey word as suffix.2) The boundary of organizat-ion name is hard to be classified, and the length oforganization names is dynamitic.
3) Organizationnames are easily confused as Location names.
Wemust use contextual information to determine itstype.
4) To recognize the abbreviation of anorganization is also a difficult task.
So we choosethe following features to solve the above problems.z A list of key word suffix is used to trigger therecognition processing.z Using indication words to define the boundaryof organization.z Heuristic searching method is used to assistLocation recognition.The features we used in the CRFs model are thesame as used in Location model.
We use themutual information to select 513 for-indicatewords and 1195 back-indicate words from trainingcorpus.
The number of key suffix words is 3129.4 ExperimentsWe participate in the SigHAN Microsoft ResearchAsia (MSRA) corpus in open track.
The table 3 isthe official result of NER by our system.R P FPerson 0.9657 0.9574 0.9615Location 0.9593 0.9769 0.968Organization 0.8778 0.9338 0.9049overall 0.9377 0.9603 0.9489Table 3.
SigHAN MSRA corpus test resultsThe training corpora we used comes from 1)1998 People?s Daily corpus; 2) the training corpussupplied by MSRA for SigHAN bakeoff 4.
Thesetwo corpora have many difference and we focus onhow to get a good performance both on trainingcorpus and testing corpus.
We select some generalfeatures and get assistance from the heuristicsearching method.
A good list is very important,which has been proved by the experimental data.We collect nearly 1 million personal names, 40thousand location names and more than 300,000organization names.5 ConclusionIn the paper, we give a presentation to our ChineseNamed Entity Recognition System.
It uses alanguage mode to recognize personal names, andtwo CRFs models to find Location andorganization separately.
We also have a flexibleheuristic searching method to match entity innamed entity list with text characters sequence.Our system achieves a good result in the openNER track of MSRA corpus.AcknowledgementThe work is supported by the National HighTechnology Development 863 Program of Chinaunder Grants no.
