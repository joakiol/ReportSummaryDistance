Particular emphasisis given to ten~inology acquisition and facilitiesfor automated lexicography?INTRODUCTIONAutomatic language processing makes a current use of multilingualdatabases as a component of the computer environment of machinetranslation projects or computer-aided translation~ and as a meansof coordinating terminological standardization across severallar~cages.
Translation database projects have been developed inNorth America and Europe and there is a great variability in theircontent, use and structure?
Vfhat is common about them all is theattempt to speed up and simplify the trsnslation process, theeffcrz to support many languages~ to increase the volume and relia-bility of the linguistic information contained, to assure flexibleaccess to the database, to make it inexpensive and available to alarge number of users?BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT TEE~SERVICENobody working in a scientific or technical field can do withoutsome information published in other languages.
This implies thatthe need for translation is enormous, which means that for eachlanguage efforts must be made to compile the correct terminology.The latter, in its turn, needs to be standardized.As elsewhere, in our country translators and specialists inscientific or technical fields are asking to have the terminologyrelevant to their work made available in foreign languages.Moreover, conventional dictionaries, provided they exist, cause alot of problems and often turn out to be an inefficient alterna-tive.
This is mainly due to the rather long publication terms whichmake a specialized dictiouary inadequate when it is finallypublished~ especially in rapidly developing fields wh~re the grov~hof terminology is most pronounced.
Besides, a conventionaldictionary, as a rule, makes no provision for updating its files,mainly from feedback coming from users.The only technique which offers enormou~ storage capacity and fast265266 B. NIKOLOVA and I. NENOVAretrieval of terminology is computerized data processing.
A wellset up terminology bank offers ample opportunities to solve thedifficulties met by the translator or specialist in the field indealing with scientific or technical texts.To meet these needs, the Laboratory of Mathematical Linguistics atthe Institute of Mathematics with Computer Centre affiliated to theBulgarian Academy of Sciences has set itself a number of short,medium and long-term aims, designed to lead to the setting up ofautomated terminology services - the project TERMSERVICE.FUNCTIONS A~ND USERS OF THE SYSTEM TERMSERVICEThe system TEk~VICE is designed to be used in the followingenvironments:- in the computer-aided translation environment the terminologicaldatabase can be used by human translators and specialists inscientific and technical fields as a computer-aided multilingualdictionary;- as far as the terminological environment is concerned, the data-base provides sufficient linguistic information to conduct researchon terminology and to standardize terms, abbreviations, acronyms inseveral languages.As secondary resulting use environments we could mention:- machine translation systems which can adapt and incorporate theterminological database to serve their aims in translating naturallanguage documents;- computer-aided instruction in foreign languages.ACQUISITION OF TERMINOLOGYDictionary-making is a popular trade with established traditionalprocedures for compiling the lexical files to be included in aprinted volume.
People are also aware of the traditionally highcost of developing user-oriented specialized terminology.
This taskis quite labour-cons~ming and requires team efforts from a largenumber of translators, terminologists and lexicographers.As far as the traditional methods of lexicography are concerned,the computer can help in alphabetizing and updating the files,which is a comparatively elementary level?The literature notes the following ways of establishing linguisticmaterial for the development of terminological databases:- analysis of original documents in each language, the comparativestudy of these documents giving real equivalents of professionallanguage usage;- compilation of terminology by specialized institutions~- inclusion of terminology contained in conventional dictionariesand other reference materials;- interaction between currently existing databases and terminologyexchanges;- techniques ether than by means of text~ as, for instance,experiment~ inquiry~ introspection?TERMSERVICE 267PARALLEL TEXTS ANALYSISWe have chosen to extract terminology from previously translatedmaterial by the method of parallel texts analysis.
The idea wastaken up from presently existing automated systems fer lexicographicservices developed in the USSR by the All-Union Centre forTranslation of Scientific and Technical Literature and Documenta-tion, Moscow.Preference is given to this method since it yields most reliableand genuine results about the state-of-the-art of terminology andallows to perform the lexicographical work mostly automatically.An original text in one language and its translation in another aretermed as parallel texts.
The task is to separate the items oftranslation in the original text, to find their equivalents in thetarget-language translation, to establish a one-to-one correspon-dence between them and fix the latter in a correspondence file.We have accepted the following definition for "an item of transla-tion": an item of translation is the minimal language unit from theoriginal text which is to be translated as a whole in the sense ofno language units available in the translational text that repro-duce the meaning of the components of the given item of transla-tion, in case there are any.Some authors point that an amount of 100-200 thousand wordformshave to be processed in order to reach a point of strong decreasein the number of new terms to be included in the dictionary.THE PROGRA~ PACKAGE AND THE RESULTSThe program package for automated compilation of terminology inEnglish and Bulgarian contains 8 programs for processing of theparallel texts, and for compilation, maintenance and usage of amachine dictionary of English terms and their equivalents inBulgarian?
The programs are written in PL/I?Original English texts from scientific pa~'rs and their transla-tions in Bulgarian serve as initial l i ngu~ic  corpus for lexico-graphic purposes.
The aim is tc process the texts so that thelabour of the linguist in compiling the machine dictionary would befacilitated to a maximum degree, thus obtaining in short terms adictionary covering to a high extent the terminology relevant tothe chosen scientific field.The output from the operation of the program package is~ as Tollows:- the texts of the original paper in English and its translation inBulgarian in a form suitable for the coding of the translationequivalents;- a dictionary-concordance containing wordforms from the text,pointed by the lingais~ together with the neighbouring contextwithin boundaries specified by the linguist again.
The contextualexamples have the advantage of giving each term with a more precisemeaning than if it were isolated and serve to remove polysemyo- a dictionary of the wordforms from the original text and all oftheir equivalents that occu~ ~ in the Bulgarian translation?The package allows to introduce terms and their equivalents in thetarget-language~inexplicit form as well as to exclude separate268 B. NIKOLOVA and I. NENOVAitems from the dictionary.Parallel texts analysis is our main source of terminology but, ofcourse, it is not the only one.
We are making inquiries among themathematics professionals in the field about the volume and scopeof the terminology they find relevant to their work.
Besides, theterminology we have extracted from translated texts could be mappedto a mono or bilingual dictionary, or manual, or handbookspecialized in the field.
The facilities of an on-llne mappingwill additionally speed up and enlarge the possibilities of termi-nology acquisition.The program package could be of help not only to the linguist andlexicographer but presents computer aids to terminologists as well.The automatic context look-up supplies easily usage samples, thetext concordance facilities come at hand for building up text-oriented lists of terminology, and the merging of terminology listsfrom different sources offers opportunities to solve ambiguities ordisagreements in translating a term.DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM TERMSERVICEThe system TERMSERVICE is designed to support several languages,the main three being Bulgarian, English and Russian.
We use directlinkage between pairs of meanings of a certain term in differentlanguages.The fields of specialization of the database are scientific andtechnical.For each source-language term (a single word or a phrase) thefollowing information is contained in the database:- target-language equivalents,- synonyms, if any;- subject-field code;- grammatical code, spelling variants, standard abbreviations;- contextual examples of usage of the term;- definitions are supplied for source-language terms having noequivalent in ~he target language;- possible word combinations with the headword, if any;- the source the term was extracted from;- cross-references to other terms.Since the system is not oriented only towards professional trans-lators, general and specific terminology is complemented by common-use lexems, their selection being motivated by frequency of usagesThe logical access to the database can be accomplished by a lexicalitem, by synonym, subject-field code, grammatical code, source ofthe entry.The modes of access to the database are batch or interactive queryand computer output to microfilm or microfiche.
Printed dictionarieswill also be generated from the database?Source-language terms are stored in conventional dictionary fox~oTo assist the user's query, however, the project envisages a blockof automatic reduction of inflected forms to standard form?
Tillthat time the system will work with the help of human pre-editingoTERMSERVICE 269The project also envisages automatic recording of unsatisfied look-up requests for update purposes.CONCLUSIONThe Laboratory of Mathematical Linguistics at the Institute ofMathematics with Computer Centre is the first in Bulgaria to deve-lop a multilingual terminological database.
We have startedrecently and the data capture function of our project is the mostadvanced.
There is still a lot to be done in querying and updating,which is a matter of time and staff.The current study of the user's needs and a highly efficient inter-action and cooperation between presently existing terminology bankswill provide for a successful computer aid to human translation.REFERENCES(1)(2)(3)Marchuk, YoN?
