The paper ?romoses the metho~ of partialdecomposit ion into morphemes in oreer to in-crease the eff iciency of the rewrit in~ rules,so that t?~e problems of rectlon an~ agreementca~ be solved for highly iuf leotln~ languages.1.
Language analysis needs an approach to languagedifferent from the generation of the sentences ofa given lancuage:1.1.
In the case of analysis one has to reckonwitch t~e fact that beeauEe of the restrlcte~ accu-racy of the wc, y lan~:la~e ~ata are ~esiLT~ate~, ;.

We have not at our (!isposal atevery stage of the analysis t},e information that-~'.~oul~ make a c\]ear-c~t ~ecisiou possi%~le ;,,it}~ z es-?ect to the path to %'e fol\].o~,.
'ecl in the next stacesof the analysis.
This is ~hy i t  can be said thatanalysis depen@s to some extent on the previoushistory of the analysis.
This requirement~ however,does not necessarily lead to the reformulation cfthe mules but may come to the ~ ~ in o e  a ne~,~ way oft eir a plioation or the i r  orde  of   lic tlo !ii.Of course, it has to be ensued the correctness ofthe analysis that the correct structure can be ob-tained by testing in all cases..1.2.
If we are interested in the problem not onlyfrom the side of theory but also that of itspractical applicability, then we have to ensure theoptimalization of the way the correct structure isrevealed.The optimalization of analysis is related- in many respects - to the requirement of simpli-city in language theory.
Of course the method tobe applied is not in@ependent of the typologicalproperties of the language under consideration,andthis applies, above all, to the optimalization.1.3.
if we aim at the analysis of natural languagesour main requirement may be much less stringentthan the requirement of generative grammars.
Gene-rative grammars, quite reasonably, consider as aVarga 4principal requirement that any grammar should ge-nerate all sentences of a given ~ .... ~ s~o~ and onlythese.
An analogous stipul&tion is not necessaryin the case of analysiiwe want to analyze onlythe case of artificialsince we may ass~qe thatimpeccable sentences.
/inlanguages - for instance,in the case of progra~ning languages - the s i tu~onis quite different: it is a basic requirement thatthe analyzator should be able to distinguish thesyntactically impeccable strings from the incorrectones, i.e.
that he could disclose the syntacticfaults./Now the question is that what kind of methods orwhich combination of methods may lead to the re-cognition of the structure or structures of anysyntactically impeccable sentence, within optimaltime and with especial regardto  highly inflectinglanguages.2.
With respect to the non-inflecting or onlyweakly inflecting languages there is a usefulmethod for analysis, namely, the reversed applica-tion of the so-called rewriting rules.
Besides itsVarga 5simplicity, this method offers quite a few advan-~y it is based on the n~thematicallywell-formalized phrase structure grammars, secon~-!y, from a linguistic point of vie~.v, it is relatedto the IC grammar that has been elaborated for theanalysis of natural languages.In the case of inflectional languages, however,the application of such rules meets ~ a cz~l -c~loy which is due to the fact ~ha~ the app l ioa -~_on of suon rewr "+'- ~ l~in~ rules means the processingof symbols assigned to the categories of syntacti-oal!y homogeneous elements.
The number of thecategories consisting of such syntaotieally homo-geneous elements is very high in these languagesand each additional category increases the numberof the re~Triting rules by So many rules as thereare different structures in which the category inquestion may occur.
The number of rules wouldamo'Ant, for instance, in Russian to about 30-40thousand, %vhioh diminishes the applicabil ity ofthe system considerably.The excessive increase of the categories is mostlydue to the fact that the olassifigations accordingVazga 8to the different points of view may occur ingepen-cen~ly of each o~.er'.
__r# m emzzeren~ basic catego-ries were needed accor?in~ ~o one aspect of clas-sif ication and n ~ifferent categories according to+~'~ into account both another aspect then~ ?
~-~.oaspects, m.n differen~ basic categories woul$ becalled for.
If, for instance, the classif icationof substantives according to  section needed~aoo l~!cao~on accord- seven basic categories, the  ~ '="ing to the cases 6 basic categories, an~ theclassif ication according to the numbers 2 dif-ferent categories then - instead of a slno~esubstantival /N/ c~te~orj - 7.6.2 = 84 catego-ties would be necessary.should we take into considerationbetween male and female, animatelet alne the semantic categories,obtain a completely unmanagable apparatus.It is easy to see thatthe differencesand inanimate,then we ~ould3- Dependency grammars have been elaborate~ mainlyto circumvent t~e ~ifficu!ties raised by inflec-tional languages.
~ is interesting to note inpassing that in the Soviet Union this conceptionprevai ls  even today in the groups engaged in ma-Varga 7chine translation.
According to dependency grammarwe have to consider the category of the distinguish-ed ~or~ form as a representative of a complex cate-gory in each case a rewriting rule is applie6.
Inthis way the concretness of the categories is main-tained.
Xastly the predicate represents the wholesentence,standing as it aces at the top of the treediagram.At first glance a dependency grammar seems to ex-hibit quite a few advantages from the point of viewof highly inflecting languages.
This advantages maybe summarized as follows.
"~)  It 'traces back the relations within the sentenceto .he relations h, et%,;een concrete woza forms.
Inthis way the establishment of the sentence structureis traceable back to the establishment of the rela-tions between concrete words, i.e.
to the examina-tion of micro-structures.
(ii) In the case of highly inflecting languages v~hezethe zelatimns between words come to the fore throughtheir outer form, namely through the form of agree-merit and rection, the information obtained in thisVarga 8way may he used immed "~ l- i te y for finding out thesentence structure.
(iii) On the basis of the direct relations betweenwords the analysis may start at any point: at thetop of the tree diagram or at the bottom or in theorder given by the words of the sentence.~v) No difficulty in principle is encountered in adependency grammar analysis in the uniform handlingof continuous and ~iscontinuous structures.
/Thesestructures are rather frequent in highly inflectinglanguages, due to the fact that they have more ef-fective means at their disposal than word order forexpressing relations between words .
/In spite of these advantages dependency gramr~arshave not solved the problems definitively as ithas turned out that these advantages are only of arather restricted character.Ad (i).
It may happen that the examination of therelation between two words does not provide enoughinformation for further analysis.
The statement ofcomplementary conCitions is rather gifficult inVarga 9these cases and can be done most cases only by anad hoc a~jusment.Ad (iii).
Although it is possible to begin theanalysis at the top of the ~epen~ency tree, suchan analysis eeman~s either a rather laborioustesting process or the storing of a grat amountof information.
/ It is i l luminating from th ispoint of view to follow the ~evelopment of predic-tive analyses beginning with the original concep-tion of Ida Rhodes up to the varianl elaboratedby Kuno-Oettinger-Plath.
Accor6ing to Rhodes theanalysis is to be carried out on the basis ofdependency grammar, beginning at the top of thedependency tree.
The ne~v version of ?ependencygrammar is based thoroughly on ,the conception ofIC grammars.
As is \]~own, the main defect of theearlier version ~!as caused by the fact that whenlonger sentences were to be analyzee the predic-tions to be stored increased in an excessive way./Ad (iv).
In principle it woule be possible to ana-lyze all possible cases of the discontinuous struc-tures but such a full analysis seems to be unattai-nable in the forseeable future.
/ Kulagina's mainVarga lOen~avour is aimed at excluding on the basis ofa preliminary analysis those constructions thatcannot be further expected an@ making possibleF th is  analysis equal to the full analysis~2~/.
Inpractice the analysis is al~(~ays carried out on thebasis of some simplifying conditions or hypo-theses concerning chiefly the @ecomposition of sen-tences or the relations of some structures/pro-jectivity/.?.
Different methods have been proposed to circum-vent the difficulties raised by the IC grammar ana-lysis.
Choms~ tackles these proposals /proposalso f  Harris,Matthews, 8toch,:el\], Anderson, Sohachter,Harman an~ others/ in his paper submitted to theMagdeburg conference; he concludes,"the problem ofremedying this defect in PSG is clearly very muchopen, and deserves much further study" \[3\].
Withrespect to Russian it is Plath who has recentlye laborated an ingeniou s inSexing and index-trans-mission system which sets out to ensure the many-sided applicability of the rules an~ the transmis-sion of tile information from one symbol to another.Chomsky points to the fact that the indexing ofVarga IIcategoriea and the introduction of complex symbolsmeans essentially the application of a special typeof transformational gramzar.
Un@oubtedly, the puremethods have not yielded the expected results inthe analysis of natural languages.
Chomsky himselfsuggests a compromise with respect to similar ~if-ficuities that arise in generative grammars, 2tac-tically it goes about a new dimension,neglected sofar, namely about the paradigmatic lavel.
Chomskypose~ the alternative straightforwardly : eitherone should accept the decomposition Into morphemesor opt for the para@igms.
He himself pronounced infavour of the paradigmatic conception.Chomsk 7 has been led to this decision by the com-plexity of the morphemes.
However, it should beadded that quite different questions arise in thecase of agglutinative languages where the inflec-tional morphemes generally serve to express asingle grammatical function.
So, for instance, inHungarian hgzaknak == hgz ?
ak + nakhouse + P1 + DatIf we take account of this structure of words thedecomposition into morphemes seems more justified.Varga 12Taking into consideration the aspects of the syn-tactic a~aly~Is an intermediary solution offers it-self: with the aia of common rewriting rules /with-out increasing their number essentially/ a conside-rable part of the syntactic relations may be de-tected if we decompose the sentence - but onlypartially - into morphemes, i.e.
if we separatethe case category from the basic category.
Thismeans that we~may use the same symbols for the de-signation of cases of substantives, adjectives ,pronouns etc.
and it is necessary to decomposethe correspon@ing categories.
On the other hand,the case category is handled separately, the roleof which is a syntactic one in the first place.Last but not least it facilitates the separationof case and gender - number which is important inthe processing of relative pronouns.A similar situation can also be produced artifi-cially in the case of the machine translation ofnonagglutinative languages.
As in machine trans-lation the morphological analysis precedes thesyntactic one, in practice there are no difficul-ties to transform the occuring word forms on thebasis of the morphological analysis carried outVarga 13previously in such a way that the grammatical in-formation becomes explicit and so the word formsare rendered "agglutinative".To find out the rection we have usually to takeinto consideration the following factors:a./ the category of the construing word stem;b./ the case ending of the construed word;c./ the category of the construed word stem.It is, however, u.unecessazy to consider the caseending of the construing Word.
E.g.inst r .pyEOBO~ZTe~s ~a@e~po~,~ N ~o~.

+ inset + N -~ NThe rection can be examined by means of simplecontext-restricted phrase structure rules:A+~+N ~ N/~A + S +lq --~ N / S ~  eta.
(,>The decomposition into morphemes can also be usedwith respect to the participles and the infinitive.Consequently the problems connected with the rectionVarga 14of participle as  verba l  derivate may be handledseparately from the problems connected with theparticiples as secondary parts of speech being em-bedded in the structure of the sentence.5- The advantages of dependency grammars derivedfrom the fact that  they could draw conclusions withrespect to the type of the relations taking no ac-count of the arrangement of the words in theStructure of the sentence only by examining sepa-rate concrete words.
With respect to some localunits the same holds in the case of an IC analysisas well.
Such ~ local examinations can be used asinput information to further analysis, and on theother hand, ~hey may effect the reduction of thenumber of the possibilities to be considered.1.
A typical local problem is representedby the m6rphological analysis which means /in com-mon parlance/ the determination of the grammaticalproperties of separate wor~s.2.
As local problem may be considered, forinstance, the agreement of the substantive withthe immediately preceding adjective/s and/or pre-position in Russian.
/The risk to make a mistakeVarga 15is minimal, ~ a nougn it is no~ entirely unlikelybecause of the adjectives that may be used as sub-stantives too:B CTOaOBOE ~eBy~Ee ~aa~ o6e~.Such preliminary examination of compatibility isof great impo~ance in MT because "hereby the numberof case homonymies may be reduced essentially.3.
We place the examination of the possibi-lities of extension or of the realization of thesepossibilities among the local problems, at leastinsofar as it provides preliminary information forthe analYsis.
The nu~oer of these possibilities islimited and is characteristic of the language underconsideration.
First, in what ~irection and second,v~hat kind of gra~natical and lexical methods may beused for the extension, the continuation of a wordor structure.
It is highly revealing to examine howa given structure can be extented starting from~asingle sentence kernel /i.e.
not from several fullsentences/.
So, for instance, in English~Sometimes a decision to compute is followedby a process of selecting the particular kindof computingmachine best suited for the givenproblem.Varga 16o~The designer should be careful in choos ingcircuit designs that he not build in addi-tional difficulties with a choice of a par-ticular circuit in an attempt to eliminateother difficulties.The same grammatical relations would be expressedin Htu~garian oz in Russian in entirely differentways.
/We would have full clauses instead of par-t iciples in IIungarian , in Russian the participleswould be replaced by substantives derived fromverbs/.4.
Semantic information may also be use~ forthe reduction of the possibil it ies in the case of apartial analysis of ambiguous structures.
/In caseof no ambiguity it makes no sense to use semanticinformation if we assume that the input sentences 'are impeccable not only grammatically but also se-mantically, cf.l.2/.Notice that the constructionalhomonymy extending over the whole sentence is?
rather unusual, we have, however, frequent cases ofambiguous structures ~ithiu sentences.
So, forinstance, in Russian the string ',BCXeACTBHe ~py~xBaEOHOB Co~TpaHeH~j a Ta~xe Oc06eHHOOTe~ BsaH~o~e~-CTB~S ~acTn~"Varga 17may have 7 different bracketings, i.e.
7 differentstructures.
If there are several syntacticallyambiguous structures in the sentence then it woul8be unnecessary to carry out a new.
syntactic analy-sis for each of them: if we can localize the ambi-guous structure the production of all possible sen-tencestructures is merely a matter of combination.The mentioned local problems need not be:incorpo-rated into the main program, i.e.
the proper syn-tactic analysis.
A considerable part of them may becarried out either previously or simultaneouslywith the morphological analysis, while other pro-blems may be solve8 as subsidiary operations, ineach case separately, when some rules are applied,if necessary.6.
The crucial point of the syntactic analysis ofthe whole sentence /i.e.
not of the form of therules, but of the strategy of their application/ isthe problem where to begin the analysis, i.e.
atwhich word of the sentence \[4\].
Lees says withrespect to the order in which the transformationalrules must be applied, that one has to begin withV arga 18the constituent sentence that is embedded deepestanc~ that further transformations can only beapplied to matrix sentences previously "satisfied".This holds -mutat i s  mutandis - with respect tothe simplest structures, word groups as well.
/Na-mely, assuming that ~,e begin with the analysis of ~the given string to  be examined,i.e.from the bottomof the tree.
The other possibility is to  begin fromthe top of presu;posed tree diagram , i.e.with the hierarchy o f  the given system of rules.This pathhas  been followed in predictive analysis/.A basic problem is the determination of the struc-ture that is embedde~ deepest in some other struc-tures.
If we have succeeded in determining thisstructure then we could obtain the analysis of ra-ther complicated sentences by a stepwise processingof the embe~6ed structures in a rather simple way.Naturally, if it is wanted that an erroneous stepshould not ~estroy the whole analysis the ~ifferentpossibilities must be remembered by the algorithm.A suitable algorithm worked out by B&lint Ddm~lki~5~could be used with only slight alterations fDr theanalysis meeting the above requirement.~e can considerably diminish the number of the unne-Varga 19eessary blind alleys by taking into considerationthe type of the language huder consideration.
As toRussian, for instance,the right recursive rewritingrules prevail.
There is a right recursivity, forinstance, in the case of substantival complements"~ ~ ' "  ,a~jectives,oarticiples connected with suJstan l~esor the participial constructions embedded in eachother etc.
According to Yngve's terminology we cansay that a considerable part of the Russian struc-tures are of the progressive type.As a consequence,the tree diagram of the sentence is in most casescharacterized by right-branchin~ /or at least thisholds for some subtrees of most structures/ In thiscase, however, we arrive at the deepest part of theright-branching tree in the simplest way if we beginthe analysis at the end of the sentence.
To put itdifferently, if we consider the sentence structuregiven by a bracket expression then in the case ofprogressive lan~aages we have often a ease of thebrackets accumulating at the end but not at the be-ginning of the sentence.
To take a simple example,we have in Russian such sentences as(BH (sHaeTe (MHO~O (Teope~ (o npe~ezax~)DIf we began the amalysis at the beginning o f  thesentence, we should have to try connecting quite aIVarga 20few words ant structures that are in fact separatedby brackets, that is that are not connected witheach other.
