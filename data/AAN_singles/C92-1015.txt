ukABSTRACTAttention on constraint-based grammar formalismssuch as Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPS6)has focussed on syntax and semantics to the exclu-sion of phonology.
This paper investigates the in-corporation of a non-procedural theory of phonologyinto rmSG, based on the 'one-level' model of Bird& Ellison (1992).
The standard rule-representationdistinction is replaced by the description-object dis-tinction which is more germane in the context ofconstraint-based grammar.
Prosodic domains, whichlimit the applicability of phonological constraints, areexpressed in a prosodic type hierarchy modelled onlfPSG'S lexical type hierarchy.
Interactions betweenphonology and morphology and between phonologyand syntax are discussed and exemplified I .1 IntroductionThe exclusion of phonology from Head-driven PhraseStructure Grammar (Pollard & Sag, 1987) and re-lated grammar frameworks belonging to the Mon-tague tradition (Dowty et al, 1981; Shieber, 1986)is no doubt due to the perception that much cur-rent theorising in phonology isexcessively procedu-ral in nature.
While there is an element of truth inthis, it is also true that the predilection of constraint-based grammarians for a string-based phonology haspredisposed them towards egmental phonology, inwhich procedural thinking is at its peak.
Other vari-eties of phonology--most no ably non-linear phonol-ogy (Goldsmith, 1976, et seq.)
--have now largelyabandoned complex derivational accounts of phono-logical well-formedness in favour of systems of gen-eralised constraints.
A defining property of con-straints is that they are not applied in any particularorder.
Rice (1989, 331) writes that "a general goalIThis research is funded by the U.K. Science and Engineer-ing Research Council, under grant GR/G-22084 ComputationalPhonology: A Constraim-Based Approach.
I am grateful toMark Ellison, Ewan Klein and Bob Ladd for discussions relatingto this work.in recent phonological work has been the eliminationof structure-changing processes from the grammar.
"With structure-changing process gone, all that con-straints do is specify what it means for surface formsto be well-formed 2.
A consequence of this paradigmshift in phonology isthat he main barrier to the incor-poration of phonology into constraint-based grammarframeworks has now disappeared.In trying to assess the consequences of this pro-gramme for phonology itself, it would be instructiveto identify four major ideas or principles that havecharacterised work in the Montague tradition, outof which constraint-based grammar formalisms havegrown.
The first is THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPOSITION-ALITY, which requires that he form and interpretationof an expression be a function of the form and inter-pretation of its parts.
This principle motivated Bach'swell-known RULE-TO-RULE HYPOTItESIS, requiringthat the linguistic modules (such as syntax, seman-tics and phonology) be organised in parallel ratherthan in series, where the output of one module is theinput of the next.
The second principle is Partee's(1979, 276) WELL-FORMEDNESS CONSTRAINT, whichstates that well-formed expressions are buih up outof well-formed parts.
An immediate consequenceof this is that there can be no phonological 'repairstrategies' which operate on ill-formed structures.A third principle goes by the linked terms INTENSION-ALITY and PARTIALITY.
The idea here is that there isa distinction to be drawn between linguistic descrip-tions and the objects they describe (such as piecesof speech).
Descriptions can only ever be partial,in the sense that they pick out---or DENOTE----classesof objects rather than individual objects.
For exam-ple, in a given language, \[+voice\] denotes aclass ofspeech sounds, \[+nasal\] denotes another class, and\[+voice,+nasal\] denotes the intersection of these two2Historical note: There is a close parallel between this theo-retical position and that adopted by Th~o Venneman, Joan Hooperand Grover Hudson in the 70's in the theoretical frameworkknown as Natural Generative Phonology (Hooper, 1976).
Morerecently, Bach (1983) and Wheeler (1981) have independentlyadopted a similar stance r garding the incorporation f phonol-ogy into categorial grammar.ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO'~r 1992 7 4 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992classes.
Refining a description results in a smallerclass of denoted objects 3.
The final principle is TIlELF2OCALIST tP/POTIIESIS as expounded in its strongform by Bresnan and others, which has lead to thelexicalisation of linguistic information and the corre-sponding simplification of phrase structure roles.From these themes come such requirements that herebe no extrinsic rule ordering, no 'feature-changing',no intermediate l vels of representation, and so on;all of them principles that many phonologists haveindependently come to embrace.
The ultimate impli-cations of this perspective for phonology is the re-moval of the role-representation distinction in favourof the description-object distinction 4.
Grammar for-malisms like IIPSG also lack the rule-representationdistinction.
For exanlple, (1 a) is described by Pollard& Sag (1987, 149) as a role.
However, they also pro-vide an equivalent statement of the rule in the moreconventional 'rewrite' notation (lb).

It is shown how various interac-tions between phonology and the other modules ofgrammar can be studied within the context of \[IPSG.Section 2 presents the finite-state model of phonol-ogy advanced by Bird & Ellison (1992).
This isfollowed by a section on a phonology-morphologyinteraction (nasalisation i TerSna) and a section ona phonology-syntax interaction (complex NP shift).The paper concludes with a discussion of the short-comings and future prospects of this work.2 F in i te -S ta te  Phono logyOver the last decade much has been written on the ap-plication of finite-state transducers (FSTs) to phonol-~This modelqheoretic viewpoint is explored in detail by Bird(1990).
A first-order language, similar to Johnson's (1988)attribute-value language, ispresented inwhich both phonologicalStnletures and feature structures can be expressed.
Bird & Klein(1990, 53), Pierrehumbert (1990, 392) and Ilird & Ladd (1991,206-7) discuss ome ramifications of this view of phonology.4This new view of phonology has been investigated byBird(t 990), Coleman (1991).

of Kosken-niemi (1983).
Antworth (1990) gives a comprehen-sive introduction to the field.
The two-level formal-ism is an attractive computational model for 1960'sgenerative phonology.
However, as has "already beennoted, phonologists have since moved away fromcomplex string rewriting systems to a range of so-called nmflinear models of phonology.
The centralinnovation of this more recent work is the idea thatphonological representations are not strings of char-acters but collections of strings, synchmnised like anorchestral score.There have been some notable recent attempts to res-cue the FST model from its linearity in order to en-compass nonlinear phonology (Kay, 1987; Koroai,1991).
llowever, if a fundamental shift in perspec-tive in phonology has indeed occurred, then theserefinements o the FST model do not go far enough.We require a further estriction that a transducer canonly add information: the set of symbols accepted ona particular cell of the 'surface' tape must be a sub-set of the set accepted on the corresponding cell ofthe 'lexical' tape.
An I;ST so constrained is actuallynothing more than a finite-state automaton (FSA).Consequently, FSAs would now seem to be moreappropriate han FSTs for doing phonology, so long asit is possible to come up with some way of encodingnonlinear phonology using FSAs.
In fact, this hasbeen done by Bird & Ellison (1992), who have shownhow autosegmental TIF.RS, ASSOCIATIONS and RULEScan be encompassed byFSAs.
The central idea is thateach tier is a partial description of a string, and tiersare put together using the intersection operation (vI)defined on FSAs.Apart from being truer to current phonological the-orizing, this one-level model has a second impor-tant advantage over the two-level model.
Since theset of FSAs fomls a boolemt lattice under intersec-tion, union and complement, we can safely conjoin('unify'), disjoin and negate phonological descrip-tions.
Such a framework is obviously compatiblewith constraint-based grammar fomudisms.
As ithappens, tim currant usage of phonology in I1PSG isjust a simple form of finite-state phonology of thekind elatx~rated here.As our lirst example, consider the phenomenon ofhomorganic nasal assimilation, wherehy nasals agreein place-of-articulation with the following consonant.Thus, the sequences \[mb\] and \[ndl are allowed whilelind\] attd \[nb\] are ruled out.

Fig-ure 1 displays a simple prosodic hierarchy.
Each ofthe prosodic types denotes a set of phonetic objects(?
denotes the empty set).
Since our descriptionsare expressed using regular expressions, it is use-ful to imagine regular expressions (or automata) as inhabiting the nodes of the prosodic hierarchy.
In En-glish, nasal assimilation dries not occur across phrasebxmndafies and so the automaton given above mustonly constrain those stretches of segments that arephrases.
This localisation of the phonological con-straint could be expressed as follows:(3)phrase(~ m ,@mt 2:?
?NnL n nCnThe tnp element in Figure l, namely phon-domain,denotes the space of utterances 5.
Phonological con-straints like (3) serve to restrict this space, leaving justthose utterances that are acceptable in the language.The phonological specitication i any sign (includinga lexical sign) is a member of this hierarchy.In some langttages we may require there to be aspecial kind of interaction between the lexical andthe prosodic hierarchy.
For example, Archangeli &5The hierarchy could be enriched with more types corre-sponding to languages, dialects, speakers and registers.

If atr was thetype of harmonic utter,'mecs, then we could expressthe necessary constraint hus6: noun=> atr.
Thiskind of constraint is known as a morpheme structureconstraint, and phonologists have frequently neededto have recourse to thcse (Kenstowicz & Kissebetlh,1979, 424fl).
A more recent example of the interac-tion between prosody and morphology is the field ofprosodic morphology (McCarthy & Prince, 1990).A tinal question remains atxmt prosodic consti-tuency.
Suppose we wanted to state that a phraseconsisted of one or more feet.
We could do this usinga notation we have already seen, as follows:However, in situations like this where it is easy towrite a regular expression, we will simply write:phrase ~ loot ~where '+ '  is the Klecne phts.
Note that there is asubtle difference of inteq}retation between this nota-tion and a clause of a regular grammar.
If we writet ~- ?
and t ~ ~h, where t is a type and where cp and~/~ are regular expressions, then both q~ and g, inhabitthe t node of the prosodic type hierarchy.
We couldhave written equivalently t -> O rq ~/,.
In contrast tothis, if t --, 4) and t ~ ?, are clauses of a regulargrammar, t could be rewritten as either 0 or ~,, i.e.i - ,  0 kl g,.
Now we progress to a more detailedexample to illustrate the framework.3 Phonology and Morphology"rer&ta is an Arawakan language spnken in Brazil,described by Bendor-Sanuet (1970).
It has the li31-lowing segntent inventory:stops: p, t ,k ,  ?fricatives: s, J', h, t tliquids: 1, r ,m,nsemi-vowels: y, wvowels: i,e, a, o, u6Itere I assume that prosodic types atre actually l}mperties ofwhole signs rather than just the phonology attribute.The categoty of first person is marked by a prosodyof nasalisation on both nouns mid verbs, its tim datain Table 1 illustrates.Table 1: Terrena Datae'nm?u his word 6Ptn6?fi my word'ayo his brother '@6 my brother'owoku his house '6fv6Ugu my house'piho he went 'mbiho I wenta' qa?aJ'o tie desires ~i'n3a'?aJ'o I desireTim seginents of the words in the right column amall nasalised until the lirst obstrucnt (other titan ?)

They fur-ther claim that it is not possible to 'shift' the con-stituent past an NP sister.
This leads to the constraint\[MAJ -N\] < \[FOCUS +\], which must be disjoined withthe original LP2 as shown in (6), a technique due toUszkoreit (1986).
(6) COMPL ,(< COMPL\[LEX -\]V \[MAJ -N\] .< \[FOCUS +\]This constraint conforms to more general observa-tions that focussed material tends to appear sentencefinally (Halliday, 1967).
However, observe that in(4d), the 'shifted-over' constituent is in fact an N~',contrary to the \[MAI -N\] requirement of (6) 8.
The LPconstraint must be revised as follows.
(7) LP2 (first revision):COMPI.\[FOCUS -\] <~<~ COMPL\[LFL~ -\]Unfocussed complements must precede moreoblique phrasal complements.It has frequently been observed that here is a prosodicconstraint involved in the following data (based onCulicover (1976, 156)):(4) a.b.c.d.Mary \[called \[John I \[an elephant\]\]*Mary \[called \[an elephant\] \[John\]\]Mary \[called \[the man who stepped on herfoot\] \[an elephant\]\]Mary \[called \[an elephant\] \[the man whostepped on her foot\]\]In generative syntax this is called complex (or 'heavy ')NP shift, since it involves the movement of a directobject NP past another complement or adjunct, andthis movement is only possible if the phrase beingmoved is sufficiently large.
Recall that Pollard andSag's grammar for English has two linear precedenceconstraints.
The first (LP1) states in effect hat headsprecede complements.
The second (LP2) states thatthe ordering of complements respects he obliquenesshierarchy.
LP2 is repeated below; the symbol '<<' isthe obliqueness ordering carried over into phonology(Pollard & Sag, 1987, 174).FOCUS is clearly not the only factor involved incomplex NP shift.
Sentence (4b) is bad regardlessof whether or not john is focussed.
An interestingattempt to unravel the prosodic contribution to thisphenomenon has been made by Zec & lnkelas (1990,376-7).
According to them, a prosodic onstituentis said to be ttEAVY just in case it branches.
Thisis familiar in the case of syllables: a heavy syllableis one having two (or more) moms, while a lightsyllable only has one (Hyman, 1984).
Rather thenpresenting the details of their analysis, I shall presenta liberal adaptation of it that is more suited to thephonological framework assumed here.Suppose that an intonational phrase consists of a se-quence of stress feet 9, feet consist of syllables andsyllables consist of segments.
Using the notationdescribed in section 2, we could write:8Culicover (1976, 155-6) gives more xamples tosupportthis claim.
Other verbs allowing movement past an NP are theL)I verbs of (Quirk et al.
1972, 850).
Dative verbs do not permitcomplex NP shift.9Whether there is intervening material between the phraseand the foot is immaterial to the present discussion.AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOI)T 1992 7 8 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992phrase =t, foot +foot : ~ syl +syl : =?- kal t_l step tJ fot U 6a t_l ?
.
.To this we add some further constraints.
First, heavyphrases (phraseh) must contain two or more feet.Second, feet consist of exactly one heavy syllable,while all other syllables must be light.
Third, thevowel of a light syllable must be a schwa.phrase h =~ foot foot +foot ~ ,vyl~ ,~yl h .vyl~syl I ::?, C* ~ C"C ~ bUdt J6  H fLIgt_l .
.
.Although these specifications are admittedly rathercrude, they are sufficient for present purposes.
Thenext step is to set up an abbreviation toenable heavyand light phrases to be picked out easily.t IEAVY =\[PHONphraseh\]LIGIIT ~ \[PHON phraset\]Now we can formulate an ordering principle that ac-counts for the observed behaviour.
This is done bymodifying LP2.
(8) LP2 (final version):COMPL\[LIG|tT\] <(( COMPI,\[LEX -1Light complements mu.vt precede more obliquephrasal complements.Clearly, a combination of (7) and (8) is needed ifPollard and Sag's observations are to be linked withthose of Zec and lnkelas.
However, such a reline-ment would still be inadequate.
The acceptability ofshifting of an NP actually gets worse as the size of thematerial between the verb and the NP gets larger.
Thusthe relative weight of the complements is important.It is apparent that the spectrum of relative weightsinteracts with the obliqueness ordering in a gradientmanner that cannot be adequately dealt with in thepolarised fashion of linear precedence constraints.5 ConclusionIn the course of this paper I have presented a phono-logical framework and shown how it might be inter-faced with IIPSG.
The frmnework starts where HPSGleft off, in the sense that \]IPSG's phonology attribute--a list--can be viewed as a subclass of automata.
Theframework is potentially far-reaching in the sen~that it encompasses non-linear phonology (Bird &Ellison, 1992).
Although this work is preliminary,it is alleady clear how several standard phonolog-ical devices may be recast in this new framework.For exanrple, the traditional distinction between mor-phophonology and phonology proper and the distinc-tion between lexical and post-lexical phonology canbe modelled in terms of the distinction between lexi-cal and prosodic hierarchies.
The traditional prosodicdomains (phrase, foot, syllable) are recast as types,and domain-bounded processes are regular expres-sions tied to the required prosodic type.One area of morphophonology that has not beentouched on here is the situation where the selection ofan allomorph is sensitive to the phonological context.A well-known example of this is the a~an altema-tion in English.
One solution would be to representcontextual inlbm~ation as part of the phonology at-tribute of a sign by associating prosodic types withfinal states.c ::~ C.*v~-V.*When this morpheme is concatenated with a follow-ing noun, these prosodic types must be brought obear on the following material.Another area for i'urther work is to investigate inter-actions between phonology and semantics.
For ex-ample, it is often observed that there is a close corre-spondence between intonational phrases and a partic-ular semantic cluster called a sense unit, whereby anystretch of material that correspol:tds toan intonationalphrase must also qualify as a sense unit (Bird, 1991b).Previous accounts of this phenomenon have requiredthe mediation of a syntactic module and this has leadto an extra level of complexity (e.g.
Selkirk (1984,290-296)).
Now there is the exciting prospect of be-ing able to explore phonology-semantics interactionsdirectly.
For example, given suitable definitions, wecould simply writc: PIIRASE ~- SI,'.NSE-UNIT.It is hoped that further work in this vein will lead to anonlinear model of phonology that is fully integratedinto constraint-based grammar formalisms.
This willopen the way for applications of such frameworks toa much wider range of the world's languages.Aeries DF.
