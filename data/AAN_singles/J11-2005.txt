Handbook of Natural Language Processing (second edition)Nitin Indurkhya and Fred J. Damerau (editors)(University of New South Wales; IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center)Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2010, xxxiii+678 pp; hardbound, ISBN 978-1-4200-8592-1,$99.95Reviewed byJochen L. LeidnerThomson Reuters Corp. and Linguit Ltd.The Handbook of Natural Language Processing is a revised edition of an earlier handbook(Dale, Moisl, and Somers 2000).
This second edition was prepared by Nitin Indurkhya,a researcher at the University of New South Wales, and the late text processing pioneerFred J. Damerau of the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center (d. 27 January 2009), whose1964 paper introduced a version of what is now known as the Damerau-Levenshteindistance, a metric of the similarity between two strings and a dynamic programmingalgorithm to compute it efficiently (Damerau 1964).
Damerau also invented auto-matic hyphenation (Damerau 1970) and worked on early question-answering systems.Indurkhya, who is also affiliated with a consulting company, Data-Miner Pty Ltd., main-tains a companion wiki for the book.1The book has three parts, totaling 26 chapters.
The first part, Classical Approaches,essentially covers techniques that were known prior to the statistical revolution, that is,before natural language processing people in the mainstream embraced techniques thatspeech engineers were already using successfully for awhile.
The second part, Empiricaland Statistical Approaches, covers state-of-the-art data-driven models.2Part three, Applications, shows some techniques closer to applications.
If you aretalking to a computational linguist, information extraction is seen as an application,but if you are talking to business people, they will see it as a general technology area,from which many application products and services can be built.
The handbook ?aimsto cater to the needs of NLP practitioners and language-engineering professionalsin academia as well as in industry.

The prototypical reader is interested in thepractical aspects of building NLP systems and may also be interested in working withlanguages other than English?
(p. xxii).
Hence it would have been nice to introducesome descriptions of actual products that generate revenue (even if this meant thatthis particular part of the handbook would become outdated more quickly) in order todemonstrate how the NLP parts are embedded in non-NLP technology, and how theseproducts are embedded in the businesses that use them.
For example, the applicationchapter ?Information Retrieval?
does not describe how the topics in other parts wereapplied in Web search engines or enterprise search products, as one might haveexpected.
Rather, it basically is another technical chapter?and its probabilistic IRmaterial could just as well have been presented in part two (statistical techniques).?
2011 Association for Computational Linguistics1 http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/?handbookofnlp.2 As someone with a deep interest in methodology, this reviewer cannot resist pointing out that?empirical?
is not an intrinsic property of any particular algorithm or technical approach, but amethodology, and as such not necessarily tied to statistical algorithms only.
So the dichotomy of?classical?
vs. ?empirical and statistical?
conflates technical approach (statistics vs. rule-based) andepistemological approach (empirical vs. rationalist).Computational Linguistics Volume 37, Number 2Each chapter describes one sub-field of natural language processing, and starts withits own chapter table of contents, which gives the reader a good idea of the structureof the chapter ahead.
However, from a reference-work point of view, it would havebeen beneficial to have a consistent set of sub-headings for each chapter.
For example, itseems arbitrary that the chapter on question answering has a section on evaluation, butthe chapter on statistical parsing does not.We can ask of a book, as of any other commercial product, ?What is its competi-tion??
First, an obvious class of competitors is textbooks such as Jurafsky and Martin(2008) and, to a lesser extent, Manning and Schu?tze (1999) (which covers only statisticaltechniques), at least one of which (and probably both) are already on the professionalreader?s bookshelf.
A second class of direct competitor is other handbooks in the field,such as Mitkov (2003).
Third, a more indirect form of competition is posed by theopen access ACL Anthology and the ACM Digital Library (which is not open access,but many professionals and academics are members) in combination with Web searchengines.
We shall address these in turn here.First, Jurafsky and Martin?s book (2008) is a strong competitor to the handbook.
Forexample, its description of the Viterbi algorithm is much closer to an actual implementa-tion than the handbook?s mathematical formulation.
Second, the other NLP handbook,edited by Mitkov (2003), although now over half a decade old, has stood the test oftime well, and it has a similar coverage (and page count).
But Indurkhya and Dameraunaturally offer coverage of much more recent literature.
Third, the option of retrievingthe original papers free of charge, perhaps using a downloadable ACM ComputingSurveys article as a starting point, should be mentioned in a decade where the deathof the tangible book is predicted by many.
But not all topic areas in the handbook arecovered by up-to-date surveys elsewhere.
Due to the handbook?s survey-like style?asa tendency, it prefers extensive citations of external papers to giving actual descriptionsof the methods?using the handbook requires Web access in tandem as well.Because the handbook stays on the theoretical side, this reviewer felt compelled togive examples of the kind of questions industry practitioners are confronted with: WhichNP chunkers for Spanish are available under a LGPL license?
How do I index a text with namedentity markup in Lucene?
What?s the state of the art in company name recognition for BrazilianPortuguese in terms of F1-score?
How can I get GATE?s HashGazetteer to recognize multi-token names?
It appears that even after this book, there is still a market for a desk-sidecompanion book addressing these and other practical questions.A short review cannot possibly do justice to a 678-page volume covering a wholediscipline, but it may be prudent to point out a few specific highlights and shortcom-ings.
The information extraction chapter by Hobbs and Riloff contains an excellentdiscussion of the limits of state-of-the-art systems (Section 21.5, ?How good is informa-tion extraction??).
Its Fig.
21.3 on page 526 shows that published academic informationextraction systems have hit a quality ceiling of F1 = 60% (on the MUC datasets 1991?1998).
The real highlight of the book (with respect to its own goals as set out in thepreface) is a part of the chapter on biomedical NLP by Cohen.
Sections 25.5 ff.
(?Gettingup to speed?
), which point newcomers to the key papers of the field, key tools used bymost practitioners (MetaMap, MMTx, ABNER, OSCAR3, KeX, LingPipe), and the maincorpora, datasets, and thesauri (PubMed, MEDLINE, GENIA, Entrez Gene/LocusLink,UMLS), come closest to addressing the professional audience aimed at by the handbook.The acknowledgments point at the likely reason for this chapter?s high practical utility:It evolved from a tutorial given by the author.The handbook is remarkably free of errors; the authors and editors did a carefuljob, and were supported by a team of technical reviewers of international acclaim.396Book ReviewsConsequently, this reviewer only encountered minor typos such as ?Finite-sate?
(p. 57).It is also very carefully typeset, and printed on high-quality paper.
But the sparse indexdoes not contain entries for precision, recall, or F-score.
The NLP expert might not needthese, but if so then again he or she may not need many parts of this book; yet in aninterdisciplinary field such as the processing of language by machine, it is good to erron the side of caution, as researchers and practitioners have a multitude of backgrounds.The understanding of evaluation metrics is also of paramount importance if the book isintended to be useful to managers (managers and business people are often surprisedby the fact that NLP/IR systems do not return perfect results).If you are a researcher or graduate student who wants an up-to-date and succinct25-page starting point to get into a new sub-area, this handbook is for you.
For thetechnical professional who is looking for all he or she needs to build a prototype system,speech and language textbooks are perhaps more useful because they contain morealgorithm descriptions and examples.
Overall, this handbook is a readable and high-quality set of up-to-date surveys of all major fields of natural language processing foranyone who does not already own another broad treatise of the field.ReferencesDale, Robert, Herbert Moisl, and Harold Somers.2000.
