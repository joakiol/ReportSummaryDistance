tomAbst ractWe describe an approach to interpretingLFG f-structures (Kaplan & Bresnan,1982) truth-conditionally as underspeci-fled quasi-logical forms.
F-structures areeither interpreted indirectly in terms ofa homomorphic embedding into QuasiLogical Form (QLF) (Alshawi, 1992;Alshawi & Crouch, 1992; Cooper etal., 1994a) representations or directlyin terms of adapting QLF interpreta-tion clauses to f-structure representa-tions.
We provide a reverse mappingfrom QLFs to f-structures and establishisomorphic subsets of the QLF and LFGformalism.
A simple maI)ping whichswitches off QLF contextual resolutioncan be shown to be truth preserving withrespect to an independently given se-mantics (Dalrymple et al, 1995).
Wecompare our proposal with approachesdiscussed in the literature.1 IntroductionDitferent languages express grammatical flmctions(such as subject or object) in a variety of ways, e.g.by position or by inflection.
Functional-structures(f-structures) (Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982) areattribute-value matrices that provide a syntacticlevel of representation that is intended to abstractaway from such surface variations while capturingwhat are considered underlying generalisations.Quasi-Logical Forms (QLFs) (Alshawi & Crouch,1992; Cooper et al, 1994a) provide the seman-tic level of representation employed in the CoreLanguage Engine (CLE) (Alshawi, 1992).
Thetwo main characteristics of the formalism are un-derspeeification and monotonic contextual reso-lution.
QLFs give (partial) descriptions of in-*Present address: Dublin City University, Dublin9, Ireland; josefOcompapp, dcu.

gbtended semantic ompositions.
Contextual reso-lution monotonically adds to this description, e.g.by placing fln'ther constraints on the meaningsof certain expressions like pronouns, or quanti-tier scope.
QLFs at; all stages of resolution areinterpreted by a truth-conditional semantics viaa supervaluation construction over the composi-tions meeting the description.
F-structures area mixture of mostly syntactic information (gram-matical flmctions) with some semantic, predicate-argument information encoded via the values ofPRED features:"PRED ~CANDIDATI,~NUM SG L OBJ LsPEc.
AUnresolved QLF gives the basic predicate-argument structure of a sentence, mixed withsome syntactic information encoded in the cate-gories of QLF terms and forms: 1?Scope :suppor t  (term (+r, <nmn=sg, spec=every>,representat ive ,  ?Q, ?X) ,term (+g, <num=sg, spec=a>,candidate, ?P, ?R) )While there is difference in approach and emphasisunresolved QLFs and f-structures bear a strikingsimilarity and it ix easy to see how to get from oneto the other:pn~:, n($ r~,.,?
r,~> ~ .
*Scope : n(~,.
,~,~)?
")%The core of a mapping taking us from fstructuresto QLFs places the values of subcategorizablegrammmatieal fnnctions into their argument posi-tions in the governing semantic form and recurseson those arguments.
I,\]'om this rather general per-spective the difference between f-structures midl'l'he motivation for including tiffs syntactic in-formation in QLFs is that resolution of such thingsas anaphora, ellipsis or quantifier scope may be con-strained by syntactic factors (Alshawi, 1990).262QLF is one of information packaging rather thanmGthing else.
We tbrmalise this intuition in termsof translation functions r. The precise fln'm ofthese mappings depends on whether the Q1,Fs andf-structures to be, mapI)ed contain comparable l v-els of syntactic information, and in the case, ofQLF how this inforination is distributed betweenterm and fo rm categories and the recursive struc-ture of the QLF.
The QLF formalisln delitmratclyleaves entirely open the amounl; of syntactic in-formation that should be encoded within a QLFthe decision rests on how much syntactic intbr-mation is required for successful contextual res-olution.
The architecture of the LFG and QLFformalism are described at length elsewhere (Ks-plan & Bresnan, 1982; Alshawi & Crouch, 1992;Cooper et al, 1994a).
l/eh)w we detine, a lan-guage of wJ\]:s (well-formed f-struct'tm:s), a (familyof) t rans lat ion function(s) r fi:om {-stru(:tures to(unresolved) QLFs and an inverse flmction r ~Dom uin'esolved QLFs hack to f-structures, r andr -~ determine isolnorphic subsets of the QLF andLFG formalism.
We eliminate r and give a di-rect and underspecified interpretation i terms ofadapting QLF interpretation rules to fstrueturerepresentations.
While the initial definition of'r isdesigned to maxilnally exploit 1;he contextual res-olution of QLF, later ve, rskms nfininfise resolutionefl'ecl;s.

The orig-inal f-structure and its component parts inheritthe QLF semantics via r. r defines a simple ho-momorphic embedding of f-structures into QLFs.It comes as no surprise that we can eliminate rand provide a direct underspecified interpretationfor f-structures.Note that r as defined above maximises tileuse of tile QLF contextual resolution component:quantifier meta-variables allow for resolution tological quantifiers diflbxent fl'om surface form (e.g.to cover generic readings of indefinites), as dopredicate variables (in e.g.
support verb construc-tions) etc.
A definition of r along these lines isuseful in a reusability scenario where an existingLFG grammar is augmented with the QLF contex-tual resolution component.
Alternative definitionsof r "resolve" to surface form, i.e.
minimise QLFcontextual resolution.
Such definitions are useflflin showing basic results such as preservation oftruth.
Below we outline how r can be extendedin order to capture more then just the basic LFGconstructs and to allow for different styles of QLFconstruction.3.2 F -s t ruc ture  reent ranc iesr respects f-structure reentrancies (indicated interms of identical tag annotations ~\]) without fllr-ther stipulation.
Consider e.g.
the f-st;ructure qoassociated with the the control construction Mostrepresentatives persuaded a manager to supportevery subsidiary:\[ I'II.ED 'REPItF, SENTATIVE ~ \]NUM PL~UBJ |PEa 3 \[\]LSPEC MOSTPRm) 'persuade (} SUBJ,$ on J,i" xcow') '0 B JXCOMP\]I)REI) ~MANAGER~INUM SGSPEC A-SUBJ \[I'R'EI) 'MANAGEI\[' 1 k  SPEc/PElt/NUM 3SOa J/|IPREI) 'sell@'sultJ,$ OB.t}'PRED 'subsidiary'OBJ NUM SGLe~:a 3D\]\[\]where the object \[~ of the matix clause is tokenidentical with tile controlled subject \[~ of the em-bedded clause.

and meta-w~riables ?0_?,?R  i as required.3.3 Non-Subcategor i zab le  Grammat ica ll%mctionsThe treatment of modification in both f-structureand QLF is open to some flexibility and variation.Here we can only discuss some exemplary casessuch as LFG analyses of N and NP pre- and post-modification.
We assume an analysis involving therestriction operator in the LFG description lan-guage (Wedekind & Kaplan, 1993) and selnanticform indexing (II<...> @) e.g.
by string position) asintroduced by (Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982).

Note, however, that the translationinay overspecify the range.
In the f-structure do-main modifiers are collected in an unordered setwhile in the range we impose some arbi t rary or-dering.
For intensional adjectives (compare a for-mer famous president with a famous former pres-ident), this ordering may well be incorrect.
Henceordering information should be codable in (or re-coverable from) the representations.
In LFC thisis available in terms of f-precedence.
A moresatisfactory translation into QLF complicates thet reatment  of (nominal) Inodification as abstractedQLF forms.
Modifiers are represente(1 as extra ar-guments in the body of the form and take the formindex of dm restriction as one of their argmnents: 4x- ?Scp : form (+r, <gf=np-re str, pred=subs idiar y>,P^P(x,form(+a, <gf=am, pred=new>,Q^Q (+r) ,?h)) ,?R)Modifier ordering can then be transferred to reso-lution, or encoded in the categories of the rest, r|(>Lion and modifiers to filrther constrain the orderof application selected by resolution.4 Direct  in terpretat ionThe core of tile direct interpretat ion clauses forwff-s involve~s a simple variation of the quantifierrule and the t)redieation rule of the QLF sentan-lies (Cooper et el., 1994a).
Consider tile flag-meat  without N and NP modification.
As before,t;he semant;ics is detined in terms of a supervalu-at|on construction on sets of d isambiguated rep-resentations.
Models, variable assignment flmc-lions, generalized quantifier interpretations andthe QLF definitions for the connectives, abstrac-tion and application etc.

The direct underspecified interpre-tation schema extends to the modification casesdiscussed above in the obvious fashion.5 How to  f - s t ruc ture  a QLFThe reverse mapping from QLFs to LFG f-structures ignores information conveyed by re-solved recta-variables in QLF (e.g.
quantifierscope, pronouns antecedents), just as the map-ping froIn f-structure to QLF did not attempt ofill in values for these recta-variables.
For QLFterms with simple restrictions (i.e.
no modifiers),7 --1 is defined as follows:?

Again, 7 --1 can beextended to the non-subcategorizable grammati-cal functions discussed above.
The extension isstraightforward but messy to state in full general-ity and for reasons of space not given here.?
