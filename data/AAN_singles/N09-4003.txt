Proceedings of NAACL HLT 2009: Tutorials, pages 5?6,Boulder, Colorado, June 2009. c?2009 Association for Computational LinguisticsDynamic Programming-based Search Algorithms in NLPLiang Huang, Google ResearchDynamic Programming (DP) is an important class of algorithms widely used in many ar-eas of speech and language processing.
It provides efficient solutions to seemingly intractableinference over exponentially-large spaces by sharing overlapping subproblems.
Well-knownexamples of DP in our field include Viterbi and Forward-Backward Algorithms for finite-state models, CKY and Earley Algorithms for context-free parsing, and A* Algorithm forboth.
These algorithms are widely used to solve problems ranging from sequence labelingto word alignment to machine translation decoding.With this overwhelming popularity, this tutorial aims to provide a better understandingof DP from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
In the theory part, we try to unifyvarious DP algorithms under a generic algebraic framework, where the above mentionedexamples are merely special cases, and we can easily analyze their correctness and complex-ities.
However, exact DP algorithms are often infeasible in practice due to time and spaceconstraints.
So in the practice part, we will survey several widely used tricks to reduce thesize of the search space, including beam search, histogram pruning, coarse-to-fine search,and cube pruning.
We will discuss these methods within the context of state-of-the-artlarge-scale NLP systems.1 Outline?
