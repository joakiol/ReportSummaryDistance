MUC-3 LINGUISTIC PHENOMENA TEST EXPERIMEN TNancy Chinchor, Ph .D .Science Applications International Corporatio n10260 Campus Point Drive, M/S 1 2San Diego, CA 9212 1(619) 458-272 8INTRODUCTIONThe evaluation of data extraction systems can be supplemented by determinin gperformance of the systems on a representative selection of linguistic phenomena .The experiment performed as part of the MUC-3 evaluation was aimed at determinin gwhether linguistic phenomena can be tested in isolation for state-of-the-art dataextraction .
Although not all of the methods of data extraction used by the partici-pants in MUC-3 directly process linguistic phenomena, the methods are dealing withthose phenomena in some manner because they are present in the input .Phenomena testing in MUC-3 is testing according to the characteristics of th emessages rather than characteristics of the systems processing those messages .Inorder to determine the validity of phenomena testing at the current level of syste mperformance, an experiment was run .
The results of the experiment indicate thatlinguistic phenomena are isolatable and that performance for linguistic phenomen acan be measured using the MUC-3 scoring system .DESIGNThe problem is to devise a test to measure the performance of a data extractio nsystem with respect to a single linguistic phenomenon .
The experiment took severalapproaches to devising such a test to determine whether the phenomenon had bee nisolated .
The design of the experiment required the choice of a linguistic phenom-enon frequently appearing in the messages and critical to the template fill task .The slots from phrases exhibiting the phenomenon would be scored andcompared to the overall scores .
If there was no correlation with the overall scores ,then the possibility that overall scores were fully determining the phenomenon' sscores would be eliminated and isolating the phenomenon would be possible .
Theslots filled from the sentences were scored and compared to the overall scores as wel las the scores obtained for the slots filled from the phrases .
If the scores for the sen-tences correlated more closely with the scores for the phrases than they did with th eoverall scores, then it would be more likely that the scoring was isolating th ephenomenon .
Processing of the phrase can have an effect on the processing of th eentire sentence .
If the results for the phrases and the sentences coincide, then i twould be feasible to use scores for slots from entire sentences for future phenomen atesting .Slots from phrases exhibiting well-defined subsets of the phenomenon woul dbe scored and compared to each other.
The results of the comparisons that can bepredicted or explained would give us more confidence that we have isolated th ephenomenon .31Altered messages would be produced without the phenomenon for purposes o fa "minimal pair" type test .
The responses would be scored for slots filled from th ephrases that formerly constituted the phenomenon .
The scores would be compared t othe scores for responses to the original messages containing the phenomenon .
Thecomparison would provide more information concerning the success of isolating th ephenomenon .METHODChoice of Phenomeno nApposition was chosen as the linguistic phenomenon because of its frequencyof occurrence in messages and its criticalness for slot fills .
An example of an apposi-tive from the test corpus is "David Lecky, Director of the Columbus School."
There, were approximately 60 sentences in the test corpus containing one or more apposi-tives which were critical to slot fills .
Preliminary phenomena testing for thre eother phenomena occurring with varying frequencies suggested that a frequency o f20 was adequate for testing purposes .
With more than 60 instances of apposition ,subdividing the set for testing well-defined subsets would still leave adequate num-bers in the subdivisions .
Also, there many more cases of appositives which affectedslot fills, but could not be included in the testing because there were other source sfor the slot fills elsewhere in the message.
This high frequency of occurrence o fapposition in the messages suggests that it is a phenomenon which systems mus thandle in some way.Definition of AppositionThe examples used from the test messages are all cases of noun phrases i napposition .Among linguists, there is variation in the liberality with which the ter mapposition is used .According to Quirk et -al [1], apposition meeting the followin gthree conditions is full apposition :a. each of the appositives can be separately omitted without affecting theacceptability of the sentence;b. each fulfills the same syntactic function in the resultant sentence ; andc.
there is no difference between the original sentence and either of theresultant sentences in extralinguistic reference .An example of full apposition is the following from test message TST2-MUC3 -0004 .JOSE PARADA GRANDY, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE CHIEF, TOLD EFE THAT A NUNIDENTIFIED PERSON STEPPED OUT OF A VEHICLE AND PLACED APACKAGE IN ONE OF THE PLANT POTS ON JUAN DE LA RIVA STREET, A FE WMETERS FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN LA PAZ .
"Jose Parada Grandy" and "the Bolivian Police Chief" are in full appositionbecause they each can be omitted resulting in the following acceptable sentences ,they each are the subject in those sentences, and all three sentences have the sameextralinguistic reference .32JOSE PARADA GRANDY TOLD EFE THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON STEPPE DOUT OF A VEHICLE AND PLACED A PACKAGE IN ONE OF THE PLANT POTS ONJUAN DE LA RIVA STREET, A FEW METERS FROM THE U .S.
EMBASSY INDOWNTOWN LA PAZ .THE BOLIVIAN POLICE CHIEF TOLD EFE THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSO NSTEPPED OUT OF A VEHICLE AND PLACED A PACKAGE IN ONE OF THE PLAN TPOTS ON JUAN DE LA RIVA STREET, A FEW METERS FROM THE U .S .EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN LA PAZ .Partial apposition occurs when the three conditions are not all met .
Anexample of partial apposition not meeting condition (a) appears in test message TST2 -MUC3-0100 .THE BRAZILIAN EMBASSY IN COLOMBIA HAS CONFIRMED THE RELEASE O FREDE GLOBO JOURNALIST CARLOS MARCELO WHO WAS KIDNAPPED B YCOLOMBIAN ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION GUERRILLAS .The difference between full and partial apposition in this case is trivial requirin gonly the addition of a determiner to "Rede Globo journalist" to make the sentenceomitting "Carlos Marcelo" acceptable .Partial appositives that were omitted from thephenomenon testing were cases of appositives containing "also" and "alias .
"Thesewere omitted because of their adverbial nature.Another gray area in choosing examples concerns titles .
Quirk et almakes thedistinction between apposition and institutionalized titles .
The authors show therange from apposition in "critic Paul Jones" to full title in "Mr .
Porter" with thefollowing examples :a. critic Paul Jonesthe critic Paul Jones (with appositives, a preposed determiner i snormal but not with titles )(with appositives, postpositio nmore normal than prepositionwhereas the opposite i sallow postposition )(appositives and mostwithout the properdeterminers )(most titles and some appositives can be use das vocatives )b.

Brother George (family )my brother George/ ?the brother Georg e*George the brothe rthe brotherbrother (vocative )Paul Jones the criticthe criti c?critic (vocative)titles can be usednouns and withwith "the" i swithout "the "true for titles that33d.

For example, "Colonel," "Senator," and"Ambassador" are titles because the following judgments are similar to those fo r"Professor" above:Colonel Heriberto Hernandez*the Colonel Heriberto Hernandez (with titles, a preposed determiner i snot normal unless the noun phrase sare modified restrictively )?Heriberto Hernandez the Colonel (with titles that allow postposition ,preposition without "the" is mor enormal than postposition with "the" )the Colonel (appositives and most titles can b eused without the proper nouns an dwith determiners)Colonel (vocative)(most titles can be used as vocatives )However, "student" and "peasant" are considered appositives because of th efollowing pattern similar to the pattern for "critic" above :student Mario Floresthe student Mario FloresMario Flores the studen tthe studen t?student (vocative )Judgments may vary .One possible questionable inclusion as an appositive i sthe phrase "Attorney General ."
My judgments follow :Attorney General Roberto Garcia Alvarad othe Attorney General Roberto Garcia Alvarad oRoberto Garcia Alvarado the Attorney Genera lthe Attorney GeneralAttorney General (vocative)34An attempt was made to limit the appositives used in the testing to those mos tlikely to be agreed upon as appositives while still maintaining a reasonable numberof examples.Construction of the Test Set sThe message sentences containing appositives were extracted from th emessages for analysis .
The examples were put in a file for distribution to the partici-pants to assist in analysis of their results .
This file contained informationconcerning the categorization of the appositives and the slots affected by the apposi-tioned noun phrases and the entire sentence .The appositives were categorized as postposed versus preposed and simpleversus complex .
An example of a postposed appositive is "Jose Parada Grandy, th eBolivian Police Chief" and an example of a preposed appositive is "Rede Glob ojournalist Carlos Marcelo .
"The subdivision of the appositives according to thei rcomplexity was done subjectively based on internal structure and the context .
Both"Jose Parada Grandy, the Bolivian Police Chief" and "Rede Globo journalist Carlo sMarcelo" were considered simple .
Any complexity in an example, such as conjunc-tion within the appositive, a missing comma, or a comma inside double quotes, putthat example in the complex category.
Probably the most complex appositioned nou nphrase in the corpus was in apposition to "peasants" in TST2-MUC3-0036 .
The mis-spelling "Colonal" is part of the message .THE PEASANT COMMUNAL ASSOCIATION, ACC, CONTINUES TO DEMAND TH ERELEASE OF PEASANTS BARTOLO RODRIGUEZ, WHO WAS CAPTURED ON 2 7JANUARY, AND [NAME INDISTINCT] CAPTURED ON 2 FEBRUARY B YTROOPS OF COLONAL ORLANDO MONTANO OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE .The most important and difficult activity in constructing phenomena tests is t odetermine the individual slots that could only be filled from the phrase containin gthe phenomenon being tested.
The slots that could only be filled by the informatio nin the appositioned noun phrases as well as in the sentences containing those appo-sitioned noun phrases were noted .
The configuration option files for the scoringsystem were constructed to score just those slots directly affected by the presence o fan appositive .
Slots that could have been filled from any other phrase/sentence no tcontaining an appositive were excluded from the scoring .
This step in the test con-struction is the most likely point where human error can intrude .For the purposes of running the "minimal pair" test, a modified version of th emessage file was produced .
The messages were altered to contain simple sentence sexpressing the equivalence of the appositioned noun phrases in cases where th eappositioned noun phrases directly affected at least one slot in the template fill .
Theappositive no longer appeared in the original sentence.
For example ,THE BRAZILIAN EMBASSY IN COLOMBIA HAS CONFIRMED THE RELEASE O FREDE GLOBO JOURNALIST CARLOS MARCELO WHO WAS KIDNAPPED B YCOLOMBIAN ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION GUERRILLAS .was replaced byTHE BRAZILIAN EMBASSY IN COLOMBIA HAS CONFIRMED THE RELEASE O FCARLOS MARCELO WHO WAS KIDNAPPED BY COLOMBIAN ARMY O FNATIONAL LIBERATION GUERRILLAS .
CARLOS MARCELO IS A REDE GLOB OJOURNALIST .35The "minimal pair" test was voluntary because it required a separate run o fthe data extraction systems on the modified messages .The scoring of the appositive tests was diluted somewhat by the allowance i nthe scoring guidelines for partial credit to be given when the key contains a com-plete proper name and the response contains only the identifying part of the name .It was typical of the appositioned noun phrases that they were the place where th efull name of the person was introduced with only part of the name being used fro mthen on for reference .
A previously undetected bug in the scoring system causedone template not affected by apposition to be scored instead of another template tha twas affected by apposition.
For phrases, only 2 slots out of a possible 66 slots (3%)were potentially affected ; for sentences, 9 slots out of a possible 198 slots (4 .5%) werepotentially affected.HYPOTHESESThe intent of the testing was to discover whether the scoring isolated the phe-nomenon of apposition .
Each of the following hypotheses was proposed and tested i norder to uncover evidence of isolation of the phenomenon .Hypothesis 1 .
The systems should score differentally on the appositives(both phrasally and sententially) than they did on the overall testing .Hypothesis 2 .
The systems should score higher on the simplerappositives .Hypothesis 3 .
The systems should score differently on the postpose dand preposed appositives .
It was not possible to hypothesize whichscore would be higher.
Although postposed appositives are moreprototypical and have indications they are appositives such as comma sor dashes,preposed appositives lend themselves to treatment a sadjectives .Hypothesis 4.
The systems should score higher on their responses t othe messages where simple sentences were substituted for appositives .RESULTSThe recall and precision scores for the appositive tests appear in Table 1 .
Table2 contains the scores based on the single measure calculated by multiplying recal ltimes precision .Analysis of Result sHypothesis 1 asserts that the apposition results are independent of the overal lperformance of the systems .
To determine the validity of Hypothesis 1, scatter plotswere made of overall recall versus precision scores for a test run under comparabl econditions (Figure 1), the appositive scores for phrases (Figure 2), and the appositiv escores for sentences (Figure 3) .
Comparing Figures 1 and 2 shows that the scores fo rapposition are significantly different from the overall scores .The performance b ysystems on apposition is largely independent of their overall scores .
The same con-clusion can be drawn for the appositive scores for sentences by comparing Figures 1and 3 .36Appositive Result sSite AppRAp pPSenRSenPEas yREas yPHar dRHar dPPos tRPostPPr eR 'Pr ePADS 0 0 1 40 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0BBN 20 31 26 42 35 41 12 21 18 27 23 3 5GE 32 48 22 54 48 50 20 47 27 36 32 7 3GTE 2 30 3 32 0 0 2 33 3 33 0 0HU 20 16 19 29 30 14 14 25 29 23 8 9ITP 11 54 7 66 7 66 10 43 12 67 10 4 3LSI 2 14 3 28 3 12 1 25 3 33 0 0MDC 20 29 14 28 22 38 18 24 27 26 13 4 0NYU 32 62 21 57 42 77 25 52 23 50 42 7 4PRC 8 42 10 48 20 57 1 25 12 67 3 2 5SRI 25 63 17 59 35 58 19 67 26 57 23 7 0SYN 0 0 0 0 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0UM 43 77 32 65 68 84 32 71 45 68 40 9 2UN 2 25 6 40 2 25 2 25 4 25 0 0UNI _15 40 11 46 32; 54 _6 21 14 45 18 37Table 1 :The sites reported recall and precision scores for the appositive phrases ,the sentences containing appositives, the easy and hard appositives, and the post -posed and preposed appositives .Single Appositive Measure sSite EasyRXP HardRXP PostRXPPreRX PADS 0 0 00BBN 1435 252 48680 5GE 2500 940 1008233 6Cit'E 0 66 990HU 420 350 6677 2ITP 462 430 80443 0LSI 36 25 990MDC 836 432 70252 0NYU 3234 1300 1150310 8PRC 1140 25 8047 5SRI 2030 1273 1482161 0SYN 0 0 00UM 5712 2272 3060368 0UN 50 50 1000UNI 1728 126 63066 6Table 2 :The single measure scores were calculated for comparing easy versus har dand postposed versus preposed appositives .3 7Recall vs. Precision10 0Pr 8 0ec 6 0s 4 02 00n 0n I nI .

These parallelisms affirm that material fromsentences containing a phenomenon can be used for testing that phenomenon an dalso indicate that we may be isolating the phenomenon .Hypothesis 2 asserts that the systems will score higher on the simple rappositives than on the more complex ones.
The scores for recall are remarkablyhigher for the easy appositives as opposed to the harder appositives as shown i nFigure 6.
Figure 7 shows a less clear trend for the precision scores .
The singlemeasure of recall times precision, however, shows an unmistakable trend of system sscoring more highly for the easier appositives.
These results give us confidence thatwe are isolating the phenomenon of apposition .10 0P 9 0r8 0e 7 0c 6 0i5 0s40 -i3 0q 2 0n 1 000n UMn '1Cif HSY10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 10 039App & App-Sen Recall4 54 0R 3 5e 3 0c 2 5a 2 0l1 5l 1 050SiteFigure 4 :The recall scores for appositives and sentences containing appositive scorrelate with each other .App & App-Sen Precision-n- App PrecSen PrecFigure 5 :The precision scores for appositives and sentences containingappositives correlate with each other .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 101112131415-n- App Recall-~ Sen Recal l80?

There was no cleartrend in the results as to which kind of apposition was easier.

Two sites volunteered to runthis part of the test and they both contradicted the hypothesis .
Their scores areshown in Table 3 alongside their scores for the messages containing the appositione dphrases .
On further analysis, it was found that the introduction of the simple sen-tences made the task more complex in both cases.
Apparently, the appositioned nou nphrases convey the information more simply than a separate sentence containing acopula and requiring reference resolution .The systems, for various reasons, tende d1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141 5SitePost RX PD- Pre R X P43not to use the information in the separate sentence.

The systems scored similarly on the slots filled from phrase scontaining appositives and sentences containing appositives suggesting that infor-mation from sentences could be used to test phenomena.
Because the processing o fapposition can affect the processing of the entire sentence, the parallel results i nthese scores further suggests that the phenomenon of apposition is being isolated .The systems scored markedly higher on the simpler appositives as opposed to th emore complex ones.
These results are perhaps the strongest evidence that it is pos -sible to isolate the phenomenon of apposition by scoring slot fills .
The systemsscored differently on the postposed and preposed appositives .
It would be interestingto look at the methods employed by each system with respect to these classes o fappositives.
It was predicted that neither class would be clearly easier .
The fact thatthis prediction was correct provides strong support for the claim that apposition i sbeing isolated.
The systems scored lower on their responses to the messages wheresimple sentences were substituted for appositives .
The effect on the scores, althoug hunexpected, still supports the isolatability of apposition .
In some of the more well -defined trends, the anomalies noticed are often for the lower scoring systems .However, the systems are scoring highly enough overall at this stage of developmentfor the phenomena scores to be meaningful .
In conclusion, there are strong indica-tions that the phenomenon of apposition has been isolated by the testing and tha tperformance on apposition can be scored using the MUC-3 scoring system .Further Researc hFurther work in phenomena testing should now be focused on carefull ydeveloping a representative selection of phenomena tests for the messages .
Theevaluation of data extraction systems can be enhanced by determining performanc eof the systems on these linguistic phenomena .
Phenomena testing should be done a tvarious linguistic levels including the word level, phrase level, sentence level ,intersententially, and the level of discourse .Testing according to the linguisti ccharacteristics of the messages wouldencourage the data extraction systems t oimprove capabilities applicable to other domains .44REFERENCES[1] Quirk, R., Greenbaum, S., Leech, G., andSvartvik, J., A Grammar ofContemporary English (London: Longman Group Limited, 1984) .45PART II : TEST RESULTS AND ANALYSIS(SITE REPORTS )The papers in this section were prepared by each of the fifteen sites thatcompleted the MUC-3 evaluation .
