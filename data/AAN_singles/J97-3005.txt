Squibs and DiscussionsAnaphoric Dependencies in EllipsisAndrew Kehler  ?SRI InternationalStuart  Shieber tHarvard University1.
IntroductionIt has long been known that anaphoric relationships in the implicit meaning of anelided verb phrase depend on corresponding anaphoric relationships in the sourceof the ellipsis.
This squib concerns what the underlying cause of this dependencyis.
Does it arise directly through some uniform relation between the two clauses, ordoes it follow indirectly from independently motivated iscourse principles governingpronominal reference?Verb phrase ellipsis is exemplified by sentence (1):(1) Ivan loves his mother, and James does too.The stranded auxiliary in the second clause (henceforth, the target clause) marks avestigial verb phrase (VP), a meaning for which is to be recovered from another clause(henceforth, the source clause), in this case, the first clause.
The core phenomenon thatwe address concerns the space of possible readings of the target clause correspondingto the antecedent of the pronoun his in the source clause, which exhibits the followingdependency.
If his refers extrasententially to some third person, say Kris--that is, if thesource clause is taken to mean that Ivan loves Kris's mother--then the target clausemust mean that James also loves Kris's mother.
That is, example (2a) only has thereading reflected by the indices shown in sentence (2b):(2) a. Ivan/loves hisk mother, and Jamesj does too.b.
Ivan/loves hisk mother, and Jamesj loves hiSk mother too.On the other hand, if the pronoun refers intrasententially to Ivan, so that thesource clause is taken to mean that Ivan loves his own mother (as in example (3a)),then the target clause is ambiguous between two readings.
It might mean that Jamesloves Ivan's mother (the so-called strict reading shown in (3b)) or that James loves hisown mother (the sloppy reading shown in (3c)).
(3) a. Ivan/ loves his/mother, and Jamesj does too.b.
Ivan/loves his/mother, and Jamesj loves hisi mother too.c.
Ivan/loves hisi mother, and Jamesj loves hisj mother too.

E-mail:shieber@deas.harvard.edu(~) 1997 Association for Computational LinguisticsComputational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3Notice that the two sets of readings are disjoint and depend crucially on the antecedentof the pronoun in the source clause.
1Past approaches torecovering these readings fallinto two categories, ource-determined analyses and discourse-determined analyses.We describe these in the sections that follow.2.
Source-Determined AnalysesThe conventional pproaches torecovering the elided property in VP ellipsis have beensource-determined (Sag 1976; Williams 1977; Gawron and Peters 1990; Priest, Scha, andvan den Berg 1991; Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira 1991; Kehler 1993; Crouch 1995).Common to these approaches i  the idea that at some level of representation (surfacesyntactic, deep syntactic, or semantic) the anaphoric relationships for the source aremarked, and that the target is interpreted as if it were constructed with relationshipsdetermined in some uniform manner by those of the source clause at that level ofrepresentation.In this paper, we will use the equational nalysis of Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira(1991, henceforth DSP) as the exemplar of these approaches.
In this account, the uni-formity is specified by the solving of a certain equation in which, roughly speaking,the meaning of the source sentence as a whole is equated with the meaning of thetarget VP as applied to the meanings of the elements in the source that are parallelto overt elements in the target.
For sentence (2a), this identity is captured by equation(4a), which under suitable assumptions has one solution for the meaning P of theelided VP, namely that in (4b).
For sentence (3a), this identity is captured by equa-tion (4c), which under suitable assumptions has two solutions for the meaning P ofthe elided VP, namely those in (4d) and (4e).
In the equational account, the depen-dency between anaphoric relationships in source and target follows immediately fromthe mechanism used for constructing and solving the equations.
More generally forsource-determined analyses, the dependency follows from the method for determin-ing anaphoric or coreference r lationships in the target uniformly from those in thesource.
(4) a. love(ivan, mother(kris) ) = P(ivan)b. P = Ax.love(x, mother(kris) )c. love(ivan, mother(ivan)) = P(ivan)d. P = Ax.love(x, mother(ivan))e. P = Ax.love(x, mother(x))As noted by DSP, the equational analysis applies not only to VP ellipsis butalso to the recovery of predicates for interpreting other forms such as do it and doso anaphora, gapping, stripping, and related constructions.
These constructions forma natural class of expressions whose use is licensed by a predicate being available,or given, in context.
2 One can think of the equational analysis, then, as a source-determined method for computing the given predicates made available by a clause ina discourse.1 The choice of which particular one of the three readings was intended by the speaker is, of course, apragmatic issue, and one that we will not be concerned with in this squib.2 The concept of givenness is a complicated one; see Prince (1981) for discussion.
Our use herecorresponds most closely to her Givennesss, or discourse-old in the sense of Prince (1992).458Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3Both Ivan and James are salient enough that the referent of his in the target is ambiguousin exactly the manner equired to yield both the strict and sloppy interpretations.To summarize thus far, a purely discourse-determined analysis predicts that asentence with ellipsis should display the same readings in a given context hat theunelided form would in the same context.
Examples uch as those above appear todemonstrate hat a discourse-determined theory may account for at least some casesof dependencies between anaphoric relationships in source and target clauses.4.
Analysis of Discourse-Determined AnalysesIn order to counterexemplify a discourse-determined analysis, it would suffice to pro-vide an elliptical sentence whose pronominal reference possibilities are different forits corresponding unelided form.
Some care must be taken in clearly defining whatis meant by "corresponding unelided form," in particular, with respect o whether ornot any of the deleted elements in the elided form can receive accent in the unelidedform.
Though the issue should not be prejudged, it would be reasonable to disallowsuch accent, as an elided VP by its very nature has no possibility for exhibiting accent.By examining pairs of elided and unelided forms, we will show that, at a min-imum, discourse-determined analyses must make this accent restriction; otherwise,sentence pairs that counterexemplify them can be constructed.
We are forced to aview that discourse-determined analyses must reduce the issue of VP ellipsis mean-ing to deaccented VP meaning.
We will then argue that this is not so much a discovery,as a restatement of the problem.4.1 Accent and SloppinessIn general, discourse principles for normal pronominal reference are more flexiblethan is consistent with the reference behavior exhibited by elliptical reconstructionsbecause, for instance, overt pronouns allow for accent and accompanying deictic ges-tures.
Consider example (8), but with exaggerated accent on the second pronoun andsimultaneous pointing to, say, Kris.
(8) Ivan/loves his/mother, and Jamesj loves HISk mother.Such extra accent and deictic gesturing are capable of forcing a reading in which thesecond pronoun refers to Kris, not Ivan or James.
However, as discussed in Section 1, itselliptical counterpart has no such reading.
We would then have to require, as Hardt'saccount in fact does, that the discourse principles be applied as if no strong accent ordeictic gestures were applied.Furthermore, allowing even light accent in the unelided form is enough to falsifya discourse-determined analysis.
For example, consider the nonelliptical example (9a).This sequence of sentences i felicitous under the anaphoric relationships indicated,when the target clause pronoun is given even light accent.
Its elliptical counterpart(9b), however, cannot be taken as having the meaning of (9a).
4(9) a. Mike Tyson will always be considered one of the greats of pro-fessional boxing.
After one round with Spinksi, Tysonj beat him/.Now people think that no one can beat himj.4 We use the # symbol to mark examples that are infelicitous nder the intended interpretation.460Kehler and Shieber Anaphoric Dependencies in Ellipsisb.
# Mike Tyson will always be considered one of the greats of pro-fessional boxing.
After one round with Spinksi, Tysonj beat him/.Now people think that no one can.Example (9) demonstrates that pronouns within copied VPs are not as free to seekextrasentential referents as their unelided VP counterparts.
Example (10), a variant ofan example that Hardt (1992a) provides to argue against source-determined analyses(see Section 5.1), shows that this is also the case for intrasentential referents.
Thereading where Mary asked out Bob at Bob's party, while readily available with lightaccent on the pronoun in example (10a), is not available in its elided counterpart (10b).
(10) a.b .#Every boyi was hoping that Mary would ask himi out, but thewaiting is over.
Last night at Bob'sj party, she asked himj out.Every boyi was hoping that Mary would ask him/ out, but thewaiting is over.
Last night at Bob'sj party, she did.Rooth (1993) gives a similar example, shown in (11a-b).
(11) a. John/s coach thinks he/has a chance, and Jamesj thinks hey has achance too.b.
# John/s coach thinks hei has a chance, and Jamesj does too.Rooth claims that whereas the unelided form in example (11a), even without accent,gives rise to a sloppy reading, the elided form in example (11b) does not.
However, likethe cases discussed above, some speakers find the target clause pronoun in example(11a) to require light accent under this interpretation.These examples erve to further restrict the assumptions needed to support adiscourse-determined approach--elided VPs exhibit the discourse behavior of deac-cented VPs.
Making this (quite reasonable) assumption, discourse-determined analysesare to be seen as reducing VP ellipsis not to general discourse principles for pronomi-nal reference (as they generally have been presented), but to a more specific construc-tion.4.2 Deaccented VP BehaviorRecall from Section 2 that VP ellipsis, do it, do that, do so, and related constructionsform a natural class of expressions.
Although these forms differ with respect o theirsyntactic and some of their referential properties, all have one property in common:their meaning depends on information that is given in, and therefore recoverablefrom, the existing discourse state.
Consequently, all exhibit the same range of strictand sloppy readings.
Deaccenting is also a well-established indicator that materialis given information in the discourse (Terken and Nooteboom 1987, inter alia), andtherefore it falls in this same class.
As with the various forms of event reference, a VPthus requires an "antecedent" to license deaccenting that either exists in the discourseor is inferrable from it.
55 Rooth (1993) also posits the equivalence of "semantic redundancy" (that is, givenness) constraints fordeaccented VPs and VP ellipsis, but ultimately cites the differing readings in examples like (11) aspotential counterevidence.
If xamples like (11) do in fact differ in readings, then discourse-determinedanalyses are falsified outright.
However, if even slight accent is required on the pronoun in the461Kehler and Shieber Anaphoric Dependencies in EllipsisSentence (12a) is adapted from a central example that Hardt gives (example (2) inHardt \[1992a\]), which has a preferred reading that can be paraphrased as (12b).
s(12) a. John hoped Mary would ask him out, but Bill actually knew thatshe would.b.
John/hoped Maryk would ask himi out, but Billj actually knewthat shek would ask himj out.Note that relative to the anaphoric relationships in the portion of the source clause"Mary would ask himi out", the relationships in the corresponding target clause "Shekwould ask himj out" involve "switching reference" of him from i to j. Hardt claimsthat (what we are calling) a source-determined account cannot model this switch-ing of reference, because the sloppy reading cannot be generated assuming that onlyMary and she are parallel elements.
Of course, this particular choice of parallelismbetween the two clauses is not the only one, nor is it the most natural one.
Whilethe elements John and Bill are not within the minimal clauses, they are parallel withinthe main clauses.
By recognizing the full parallelism, as manifested in the equationaskout(mary, john)= P~ohn, mary), the equational analysis straightforwardly generatesthe sloppy reading.
9 Viewed in light of the parallelism between the main clause sub-jects, the sentence does not involve "switching of reference" any more than any othersloppy reading of an elliptical clause does.
Thus, while examples uch as (12) werenot directly addressed in work on the equational method, their analysis within theframework is straightforward.5.2 Arguments on the Basis of Switching Reference with Structural NonidentityHardt presents further examples, such as (13), of "switching reference" in which thesource and target are structurally different.
(13) Every boy in Mrs. Smith's class hoped she would pass him.
In John'scase, I think she will.Hardt argues, again, that an approach predicated on determining parallelism betweensource and target would be unable to account for the natural reading of this sentence.Of course, the approach of DSP does not require syntactic parallelism in setting upthe equation for resolving ellipsis; many examples of nonsyntactic parallelisms areprovided in that work.
(See especially their Section 5.1.1.)
Thus, the parallelism argu-ment, per se, does not distinguish a source-determined analysis such as the equationalanalysis from a discourse-determined analysis.Nonetheless, it is our sense that something quite different is happening in thisparticular case.
The preposed phrase in John's case serves a special function here, in a8 To simplify the discussion, the quantifiers inHardt's original example have been replaced by propernouns.
The arguments apply to this example just as well.9 Hardt may be alluding to this when he says that "an extended notion of parallelism ight solve theproblem" (Hardt, 1992a, p. 307).
In later work (Hardt 1993), he notes that the absence of this reading"assumes that the parallel elements are the subject of the antecedent VP and the elliptical VP, althoughthis is not required in the equational pproach" (p. 67).
However, he states that allowing other parallelelements "would represent a radical departure for the equational pproach, since the solution to theequation would no longer epresent merely the elided material" (p. 67).
As it has never been possibleto construe the solutions of ellipsis equations as representing merely the elided material (see, forinstance, the solution to example (30b) given by DSP), it is not clear why this would constitute a"departure," much less a radical one.463Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3way that the prepositional phrase at Bob's party in sentence (10b) does not.
Specifically,like phrases such as regarding John, as for John, and with respect o John, the phrase inJohn's case crucially depends on context for its interpretation.
It refers to a previouslyevoked state or event, meant o exemplify or contrast John with respect o some otherparallel object or group of objects (in this case, every other boy in Mrs. Smith's class).Therefore, before the ellipsis is resolved, the meaning of in John's case must be resolved.This resolution results in a (non-asserted) representation for Johnj hoped she would passhimj, which serves as the source for the subsequent ellipsis, on analogy with cases ofcascaded ellipsis discussed by DSP, Section 3.3.
The meaning of the target of sentence(13) is then simply the strict reading, derivable by source-determined algorithms.
Theexample is thus not a counterexample for source-determined approaches.
We shouldnote that while the parallel elements for the ellipsis resolution are determinable fromsemantic role parallelism, the process of identifying the parallel elements in resolvingan expression like in John's case is clearly a pragmatic one.5.3 Arguments on the Basis of Multiple Parallel ElementsThere are other cases that do appear to be problematic for source-determined analysesproposed to date.
Example (14) is adapted from one cited by Kitagawa (1991).
(14) John told Mary to hand in his paper before Bill does.Some (although not all) speakers find the sloppy reading, in which Bill hands in hisown paper, to be acceptable.
As we would expect, the unelided version shown in (15)also appears to allow this reading without requiring any accent on the target pronoun.
(15) John told Mary to hand in his paper before Bill hands in his paper.Assuming example (14) has this reading, it appears that the source clause makesavailable the necessary relation to license either the deaccenting or the eliding ofthe VP in the target.
This would be problematic for most source-determined analysesbecause recovering this relation necessitates that Bill be parallel to both John and Mary,a possible but unattractive prospect.5.4 Arguments on the Basis of Parallelism in Coordinate StructuresFinally, we note an additional problematic ase that to our knowledge has gone un-noticed in the literature.
The case involves coordination, in which the coordinatedconstituents each contain a pronoun, as in example (16).
(16) Ivan/likes hisi mother and his/father, and Jamesj does too.Sentence (16) has the two readings corresponding towhether James likes Ivan's motherand father or his own mother and father.
However, current source-determined analysespredict four readings, also including the two in which James likes one of Ivan's parentsand one of his own parents.
That is, the readings in which the pronouns in the twocoordinated constituents refer to different entities are derivable, but do not exist forexample (16).As expected, only the first two of these readings are available for the unelidedversion of sentence (16), shown in example (17), again assuming that the VP is deac-cented.464Kehler and Shieber Anaphoric Dependencies in Ellipsis(17) Ivan/l ikes h is /mother and hisi father, and Jamesj likes his mother andhis father too.How such examples are to be handled within source-determined analyses is a subjectfor future study.6.
SummaryAlthough problematic examples for a source-determined analysis of VP ellipsis canbe found, these do not provide an argument for moving to a discourse-determinedanalysis.
Indeed, it is the thesis of this paper that discourse-determined analyses arenot alternatives to source-determined analyses, but rather, are dependent on them.
Assuch, they do not contribute to our understanding of the possible range of meaningsof elliptical verb phrases.
What these examples do show is the need to refine source-determined analyses in deriving the predicates that clauses make available in thediscourse.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported in part byNational Science Foundation GrantIRI-9009018, National Science FoundationGrant IRI-9350192, National ScienceFoundation/Advanced Research ProjectsAgency Grant IRI-9314961, and a grant fromthe Xerox Corporation.
