THEMES FROM 1972Robert F. SimmonsDepartment of Computer SciencesUniversity of Texas at AustinAustin, TX 78712Although 1972 was the year that Winogradpublished his now classic natural language Studyof the blocks world, that fact had not yetpenetrated to the ACL.
At that time people withAI computational interests were strictly in aminority in the association and it was a radicalmove to appoint Roger Schank as program chairmanfor the year's meeting.
That was also the yearthat we didn't have a presidential banquet, and my"speech" was a few informal remarks at theroadhouse restaurant somewhere in North Carolinareassuring a doubtful few members thatcomputational understanding of natural languagewas certainly progressing and that applied naturallanguage systems were distinctly feasible.My own perceptions of the state ofcomputational linguistics during that period weregiven in "On Seeing the Elephant" in the FiniteString, March-Aprll 1972.
I saw it as a time ofconfusion, of competition among structuralists,transformationallsts, and the new breed ofcomputernlks.
"On Seeing the Elephant" was arestatement of the old Sufi parable that suggestedthat we each perceived only isolated parts of ourscience.That was the period during which JonathanSlocum and I were concerned with using AugmentedTransition Networks to generate coherent Englishfrom semantic networks.
That llne of research wasoriginated by the first President of theAssociation, Victor Yngve, who in 1960 hadpublished descriptions of algorithms for using aphrase structure grammar to generate syntacticallywell-formed nonsense sentences \[Yngve 1960\].Sheldon Klein and I about 1962-1964 werefascinated by the technique and generalized it toa method for controlling the sense of what wasgenerated by respecting the semantic dependenciesof words as they occurred in text.
Yngve's workwas truly seminal and it continued to inspireSheldon for years as he developed method aftermethod for generating detective stories and nowoperas.
I, too, with various students continuedto explore the generation side of language, mostrecently with Correlra \[1979\], using a form ofstory tree to construct stories and theirsummaries.
No matter that Meehan found bettermethods and Bill Mann and his colleagues continueto improve on the techniques.
The use of a phrasestructure grammar to control the sequence in whichsentences and words are p~oduced remains quite asfascinating as its use in translatln~ sentences torepresentations of meaning.It is possible to communicate the techniquefor controlled generation of text in Just a fewparagraphs, so in dedication to Yngve, Klein, andi00the many others of the discipline who share ourfascination with generation of meaningfullanguage, the following description is presented.The last two lines of Keats" "Ode to aGrecian Urn" are:Beauty is  truth, truth beauty, that is allYe know on earth and all ye need to know.To form semantically controlled variations on thisverse we can create substitution classes as below:\[SCLASS\[SCLASS\[SCLASS\[SCLASS\[SCLASS\[SCLASS\[SCLASSBEAUTY life knowledge wisdom love this\]TRUTH honor Joy rapture love all\](THAT IS ALL)(that's all)(that's what)(it's all)(it's what)\]YE you we I some they\]KNOW sense have get see meet\](ON EARTH) (for living)(til heaven)(til hell)(in llfe)\](NEED TO) (have to)(ought to)(want to)\]and llne rules similar to phrase structure forms.
(I think of the couplet as a three llne verse.
)\[KLINEI beauty is truth -- truth beauty\]\[KLINE2 (that is all) ye know (on earth)\]\[KLINE3 (that is all) ye (need to) know\]Each KLINEi rewrites as a conjunctionterms, e.g.,KLINEI --> beauty + is + truth ... + beauty.ofThe line rules are composed of terms such as"beauty", "that is all", etc., that begin SCLASSpredications, and of terminals such as "is" and "--" that do not.
Poem and verse can also bedefined as rules:\[POEM title verse verse ... verse\]\[TITLE (Variation on Keats" Truth is Beauty)\]\[VERSE klinel kllne2 kllne3\]Actually it is more convenient to define theselatter three elements as program to control choiceof grammar, spacing, and number of verses.
Ineither case, a POEM is a TITLE followed by VERSEs,an~ ~ VERSE is three lines each composed ofterminals that occur in a KLINE or of selectionsfrom the matching substitution class.Only one other program element is required: arandom selection function to pseudo-randomlychoose an element from a substitution class and torecord that element as chosen:((CHOOSE ( FIRST.
REMDR) CHOICE)< (CHOSEN FIRS~ CHOICE))((CHOOSE ( FYRST.
REMDR) CHOICE)< (RANDOM* ( FIRST.
REMI~R) CHOICE)(ASSERT (CHOSEN jHOICE))~Note: CHOOSE is called with thecontent of an SCLASS rule in the list(FIRST.REMDR); if a choice for theterm has previously been made in theverse, CHOICE is taken from thepredicate, (CHOSEN FIRST CHOICE).
Ifnot, RANDOM* selects an element andrecords it as CHOSEN.
When a verse isbegun, any existing CHOSEN predicatesare deleted.This is a procedural logic program with listsin dot notation and variables marked using theunderscore.
It is presented to give a sense ofhow the program appears in Dan Chester's LISPversion of PROLOG.
The rest of the programfollows the poem, verse, and Keats-LINE rulesgiven above.The program is called by (POGEN KEATS 4),KEATS selecting the grammar and 4 signifying thenumber of verses.
A couple of recordings of itsbehavior appear below.
*(POGEN KEATS 4)(VARIATIONS ON KEATS" TRUTH IS BEAUTY)(LOVE IS LOVE -- LOVE LOVE)(ITS ALL YE HAVE TIL HEAVEN)(ITS ALL YE NEED TO HAVE)(LOVE IS LOVE -- LOVE LOVE)(THATS ALL THEY KNOW ON EARTH)(THATS ALL THEY OUGHT TO KNOW)(WISDOM IS RAPTURE -- RAPTURE WISDOM)(ITS WHAT YOU MEET FOR LIVING)(ITS WHAT YOU WANT TO MEET)(LOVE IS ALL -- ALL LOVE)(THATS ALL WE SENSE TIL HELL)(THATS ALL WE HAVE TO SENSE)((POGEN KEATS 4))*(POGEN KEATS 5)(VARIATIONS ON KEATS" TRUTH IS BEAUTY)(BEAUTY IS TRUTH -- TRUTH BEAUTY)(THATS WHAT YE SEE ON EARTH)(THATS WHAT YE WANT TO SEE)(KNOWLEDGE IS ALL -- ALL KNOWLEDGE)(ITS ALL THEY MEET TIL HELL)(ITS ALL THEY HAVE TO MEET)***(LOVE IS RAPTURE -- RAPTURE LOVE)(ITS ALL SOME KNOW TIL HEAVEN)(ITS ALL SOME NEED TO KNOW)(LIFE IS RAPTURE -- RAPTURE LIFE)(THATS WHAT SOME GET FOR LIVING)(THATS WHAT SOME OUGHT TO GET)***(LIFE IS LOVE -- LOVE LIFE)(ITS ALL I SENSE ON EARTH)(ITS ALL I WANT TO SENSE)***((POGEN KEATS 5))Perhaps these verses might best becharacterized as those Keats wisely rejected.Nevertheless our robot-poet demonstrates theeffectiveness of phrase structure organization andsubstitution classes for selecting and orderingactions.The ideas of Pogen led to related methods forcreating paraphrases, answering questions, andtranslating between languages.
The principle ofphrase structure organization has permeated our NLefforts and found a particularly friendlyenvironment in procedural logic where Chester andI \[1982\] show that the same grammar thattranslates English strings into semanticrepresentations can serve to translate therepresentations into English strings.
Thisresult, confirming an earlier finding by Heldorn,greatly simplifies the linguistic programmingrequirements for NL translation and textquestioning systems.Since 1972 the computational linguisticsworld has changed much.
Today AI and Logicinterests tend to overshadow linguistic approachesto language.
But despite all the complexities intranslating between NL constituents andcomputational representations, augmented phrasestructure grammars provide a general and effectivemeans to guide the flow of computation.REFERENCESSimmons, R.F., and Chester, D.L., "RelatingSentences and Semantic Networks with ProceduralLogic," Communications of the ACM, September1982, (in press).Simmons, R.F., and Correira, A., "Rule Forms forVerse, Sentence, and Story Trees," in Findler,N.V., (ed.)
