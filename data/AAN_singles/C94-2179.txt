INT I I .ODUCTIONIn this paper, we give a formed representation of thethematie-rhematic ('P-ll) structure of a, nahum\] lsLn-triage discourse.
Some pairs, triples, or in generaln-tuples of sentences in a discourse may differ in the1)hLee of theh' information focus.
The distribution ofthis inform~ttion focus is c~dled the thematic-thematic(T-R) structure, or dichotomy.
\[n English, the use ofpaa'ticles tile and a (an) is deeply related to tile T- l lstrnctu re.
lit general, a noun with the particle a con-stitutes arheme part of tit(; sentence that appears atthe \])cginiug of the discourse or text, while that nounwith the p~Lrticle tl~e ~ppe~rs ht the second, third, etc.sentences ~LS themes.
In Ja.p~Lnese, the %1{ dichotomyis we.ll represented by postpositlons wa and .qa.
TheKorean bLnguage h~s a similar system.
Meanwhile,in Slavic langu~rges ~s Polish, Czech, and \]lnssian,the word order is free ~nd this degree of freedom isused h)r the represent~tion \[ the T-R dichotomy.
InChinese, the word order is also used f(~r the T-R di~chotomy.
Besides theme and rheme, simibLr terms s.sold-information and new-itgormation, topic ~nd com-ment, topic ~tnd focus etc.
~re used in the literatureconcerning functionaL1 lingnistics (see, e.g., Va\]lduvi).In our ~tn~dysis, ince we do not define these termsexplicily, it is not essenti~d which terms are used.
We.give implicit definition of these concepts a.z'iomati-cally.
We eonside.r the problem mainly for J~p~Lnese.We propose to Its('.
typed A-c~deulus to analyse theproblent.
A logie~d notation is seen as a typed Xterm.

Tile difference of T-It di-chotomy is given by different types.
Thus tile samesentence *nay h;~ve different types depending on the*l';tchujim~ Kotc-ku Tokyo J~tpa, nsitnation.
For utterstnces, type inference will be per-formed.

REPRESENTATION BASED ON ATYPED A-CALCULUS'I'll(; purpose of this psLper is to propose ~t formaJmodel for nttersu~ce interprctsLtion of the them~tticrhematic structure of a ,|~tp~tnesc nte l /ee  using tttyped k-cedculus.
In our sLn~dysls, a logical notsttionis seen as a typed A-term.
B~tsic types stre.
51' a, nd/L Roughly spe~king, 7' and /{ sttuld R)r ~ themeps~rt and ~ rheme part of a sentence, respeetlvely.Although we analyse ma.hdy Japanese sentences, theresnlts can be tLpp\]ied to other langn,Lges.
The T-\[~dichotomy of ~t Japanese sentence is represented bythe postpositions wa a.nd ga. For extLmple, the fololowing two sentences ~re different in T-I{ dichotomy,~nd used in dit\[rent situtttions: (a) Taroo wa Gakusei,lea,,.
(Speaking of Ta,'oo, he is a student) (b) 'l'arooga (?akusei desu.
( (Of  all the people we are talkinoabo,a) "*~,'oo (and o,~l,a 7a,'oo) i.~ ~, .,t,,,~e,~t.)
Themo~ning or both (,,) a~,(l 0')  i,~ ~'~,,.0o i., a .~,,t~,,~,~nd thus ma.y be wrlten ~s student(Tn.roo).
I\[ow~ever this representation is obviously not sufficient foran ~tcc'ount of the utter~Lnce interpretation of (~) and(b).
The NI' (noun phrase) of (a) marked with wafunctions as ~ theme, i.e., it should h~Lve ~dready ,~p-petered in the preceding discourse and thns can beconsidered ~m ~n old information.
Therefore, in thediscourse, sentence (~) should t)e preceded by ~t sen-tenee that contains "l'a~'oo sm a rhe.me (new informa-tion), l,'or example, Taroo in the.
fol\]owing sentencecan be considered as ~L new information: (c) 7a,'0o gaima.su.
(llc,'e is 7h,'oo.)
The pair (e), (a ) in  thisorder is ~L correct discourse utterance.
On the otherh,~nd, the p~dr (c), (b )cannot  be considered correctsince student functions ,as ~ theme in (b) while it h~mnot appeared in the preceding context.
As is seen1105from (b) and (c), an NP marked with postposlt ion.qa fnnct ions as a theme (i.e., information focus).
Toexplain the difference between (a) and (b) in the ut-terance level, we annotate  Ax.student(x) of (a) and(b) by different typed A-terms.
Roughly speaking weassign T ---* It and R to each Ax.studeM(x) of (a)and (b), respectively.
Based on this, if we can showstudent(Taroo): 12 then we say sentence (a) (or (b))of the discourse is correct.
For example, if Taroo of(@ has a type T then by the f l-reduction of typedA-calculus, we have student(Taroo) : 12.
For Tarooto have a type T, we impose a constraint  hat  Taroomust have appeared in a preceeding sentence.
Othercases can be treated similarly.
See the following de-scriptions for details.
Thus the correctness of thediscourse CaLL be proved by checking the correctnessof the types of eavh formula.
In general, given a dis-course so,sa,"' ,s,~ in logical forms, what we haveto show is that  (k so : 12), (so : 12 k st : R), .
.
.
,(so : R, .
.
.
,  s,~-L : R ~" s,~ : R ) ,  succesively.First consider the following discourse consist ing of asingle sentence.Taroo ga imasu.
(Here is Taroo.)
(1)The meaning of this sentence is:so = here_is(Taroo) (2)We define this discourse to be correct if so : R. Thisis done in the following way: Translate Taroo ga intoAf.f(Taroo).
We let this formula have either type ofT --+ 12 or 12 --~ 12 when the proper noun Taroo ismarked with the postposit ion ga.
Thus we have thefollowing translat ion rules:Taroo ga ~ Af.f(Taroo) E so : T ---, R (3.1)Taroo ga ~ Af.f(Taroo) ~ s0:  R ~ R (3.2)This can be writen for short asTaroo ga ~ A f .
f (Taroo) ff so:  (T or 12) -+ tt (4)In the above, t ~_ s0 means that  t is a typed A-termcomponent  of the logieM formula so.
That  ist gso  i f \ ]  (?
t l , t2) tLt t2=so (5)A sentence of neatral  description in the Jap~nese lan-guage was first found and named by Kuroda (1965).This kind of sentence has no theme part.
For thiskind of verb, we assign a type R and write ms follows:k Ax.here_is(:~) E_ so: 12 (8)Now by (6) and (8) we can deduce the following judge-ment.eo : Ao ,  ea : A1 F( A f .f( Taroo) )( Acv.here_is(x) )= (Ax .here_ i s ( * ) ) (Taroo)= hereSs(Taroo) = ,so: R (9)where e0 : A0 and el : A1 stand for (6) and (8),respectively.
Thus ,so : 12 has been proved and thecorrectness of the discourse (1) has been establ ished.To deduce (9), we have of course used the inferencerule of the typed A-caJculus given byco : a --+ fl, e l  : cY P eoel : fl (10)Note that  the type used for (Af.\](Taroo)) in deduc-tion (9) is R -+ R. In general, for a neutral  descrip-tion, f l-reduction for 12 + R ~nd R occur.
Next weconsider the discourse consist ing of the following twosentences.Taroo 9a imasu.
(Here is Taroo.)
(11.1)Taroo wa 9akusei desu.
(Taroo is a student.)(11.
'2)The T-R dichotomies of tile above sentences are asfollows:Taroo ga imasu.Rheme Rheme (12.1)Taroo wa gakusei desu.Theme Rheme (12.2)The NP (noun phrase) of (12.2) marked with wa func-tions as a theme.
It should have already appeared inthe preceding discourse as a rheme.
The discourse(12) satisfies this constra int  since Taroo appearsa rhemc in (12.1) since it is marked with the post-posit ion ya.
The discourse (12) is ax:tnally correct.We now formally state the correctness of (12).
Thet lere t~ and/or  t2 may be empty.
Thus so _. so.
From logical forms of (:12.1) and (12.2) are given as(3), we have~- A/./(T~roo) C .90 : (T or R) --, n (6)The verb imasu allows a neutrM description.
A neu-tral descript ion has the following T-R dichotomy:Taroo ga imasu.Rheme Rheme (7).~o = ~ere_ i4  T~roo)  (13.1)sL = ~t~de,~t(Taroo)  (13.2)First we must  show so : 12, however we have M-ready seen this.
Thus we show sL : R. Note thatso = (Ax.student(x))(Taroo).
It is natura l  to ~ssiguAx.student(x) a type T ~ R since (12.2) contains1106the i)ostposition wa.
This postposit ion is catlled thethemattic wa.
We write this ~s follows.wa flakusci desu ==~Ax.studt:nt(a:) ~ s, : 7' ~ R(l'h?~s we ht~ve(14)2'hcrefore if Taroo h~us at type T, we hKve st : 1~ byfl-reduction.
The NP ca,n be ,~ theme if it has MreMyatppeared in the preceding discourse ms t~ rheme.
Thisrule e~tn be written as follows:&f. / (To .
roo)  ~_ so : ('1' or ~)  --~ ~ ~ ~r,,.o,, g s, : "r(~6)Now .st: \]/, e~n be show,, ats follows.
By (6) amd (H0,~- T,.roo ~ st : 7' (17)Applying the fl-reduction rule to (15) atnd (17), wehatve st : R. Thus the discourse (11) is correct.in Japatnese, the following sentence art the beginningof the discourse is not n~turM.~r,,.oo ,,,,,.
,,,a:.,,,s~; des,,.
(:r~,.o~ is ~,..~,,.d~,,~.)
(~s)This is bec~Luse Taroo atppe~trs ats t~ thente but it is notproceeded by ~ sentence in which ~lhroo atppeatrs aa ~rheme, in our formM description, the incorrectnessof the discourse (18) is described ~us at fatihlre of typecheekhlg.
We define the discourse to be incorrect ifeither so : I?.
or Sl : R is not proved.
Indeed, so : I~,where so = st~Ment(Taro,o) is not proved since we donot have Ta.roo E .so : T.We now consider the following discourse consistingof two sentences.Ga.k'l~.s~i ga imasu.
(19.1 )7'o.roo (.la flokusci desu.
(19.2)The logleM forms re," (~9.1) atnd (19.2) ~re given ,'usfol low s..so = (9:c)studcnl(x) A here_is(x) (20.1)S 1 : :  s~,l(tg'l\],l(T(troo) (20 .~)Since flakusci (student) is m~rked with the postposi-tlou Oa, atnd the verb imasu ~fllows ~ nentratl descrlp-tiolG we h~tvel"rom this we hatve,(3,)st~,~,,t(~,) ~ .%: ~ (uu)In genera\] we hnpose the following postub~te.AABEs I :  I?,F AEs~:  1~ (23)Furthermore we atdd the following postula, t e.(&;y(x) E so : I~ ~- ~x' / ( : '0  E s, : "r (24)where Q stands for a qn~ud;ifier V or 3.
This postul~d;emeans thatt at predlc~tte thatt ~ppeatred as ~t rheme catnbe treatted sts at theme in the succeeding sentences.From this ~uM (22) we c~n deducea:,,.s,,,ee,,,,~(.~) C s, :  T (~s)We.
now show s, : R. I"irst l)y (4) we h~ve (6).
Ap-plying the fl- reduction rule (10) to (6) ~t,~<l (25) wchatve sl = sbu.denl(Ta.roo) : R. Therefore, the dis-course (19) is correct.
Note that the type used forA/.
f (Taroo)  is 7 ' -~ ll.
Compatre this with (9).We now consider the following discourse consistingof at single sentence~Taroo 9a gakusei desu.
(26)\[n the atbove sentence type checking fMls ~,s follows.Since the postposit ion 9a is ,~ttavhed to Taroo, we.hatve (6).
Therefore, Ax.student(x) E .so must hatve~t type of either T or 1L I lowever this is impossible.Since flakusei desu c~tn not be used in at sentenceof neutrM description, Am.student(x) F si never hasat type /L The sentence x ga gakusei dcsu Mwatysmeatns thatt it is x who is a student ~nd is used onlyin the situattkm where gakusci is a theme.
Accord-ing to Kuno (1973), this use of predicate is cMled theexhgustlve-listing.
On the other h~nd, Ax.student(x)catn have ~ type T only when student ha.q atppeatred a.sin (21) in the preceeding context atnd the postulatte(24) catn be used.
Since (26) does not h~ve ~ pre-ceeding text, it never hatppens.
Thus it fMls to proveso : II ~md it h~ts been estM)lished thatt (26) is not ncorrect disconrse.So fitr we h~ve considered iscourses consisting of twosentences, fIowever the atbove method ctLn be easilyextended to a discourse that is consisting of moreth~n three sentences.
In this case, the inference rulesused over severM sentences atre modified.
For exatm-pie, (16) can be modified ats follows:Af.
f (Taroo)  E sl , i  < j : (T or R) -+ RH Taroo E ,sj : T (16')where si denotes the logleM h)rm correspond ing to thei-th sentence of ~ discourse.
Furthermore, 7'aroo c~nof course be atrbitratry term, a~nd thus we (:atn estM)\]ishthe following more genera\] rule:(1c,")1107I I I .
CONCLUSIONSIn this paper, we have given a formM representationof the T-R structure of a natural language discourse.We have proposed using a notion of typed /k-cMculus.A logical notation has been seen as a typed ),-term.The correctness of a given discourse can be proved bychecking the correctness of the types of each utter-ante.
Although we have analysed mainly Japanesesentences, the results can be applied to other lnn-guages by considering adaquate translation rules toencode a given sentence to formal representations.in Uetake (1993, 1994), the author has proposed an-other tool for the analysis of the T-R structure.
Thetool nsed there is a logical notation called ontologi-cal promiscuity of Ilobbs (1985), which is first-orderand nonintensionM.
Using this description, a proofprocess of utterance interpretation of a discourse isobtained.
It is interesting that two concepts sim-ilar to these (i.e., typed A-c~dculus and ontologicalpromiscuity) used in the analysis of the T-R struc-ture of a discourse are used in the theory of con-structive mathematics (r-realizability and construc-tive type theory).
The concept of ontological promis-cuity in Uetake(1993, 1994) corresponds to the r-reMizability and the typed ),-c~lculns of this paperto the constructive type theory.
See Uetake (1994)for more detailed discussion.One of the reviewers noted that Barbara Partee is re-cently working on logically reconstructing the Pragueschool's notion of topic-focus articulation.
