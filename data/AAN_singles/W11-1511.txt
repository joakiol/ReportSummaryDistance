We presentcurrent knowledge about the manuscript?s textthrough a series of questions about its linguis-tic properties.1 IntroductionThe Voynich manuscript, also referred to as theVMS, is an illustrated medieval folio written in anundeciphered script.There are several reasons why the study of themanuscript is of interest to the natural language pro-cessing community, besides its appeal as a long-enduring unsolved mystery.
Since even the ba-sic structure of the text is unknown, it provides aperfect opportunity for the application of unsuper-vised learning algorithms.
Furthermore, while themanuscript has been examined by various scholars,it has much to benefit from attention by a commu-nity with the right tools and knowledge of linguis-tics, text analysis, and machine learning.This paper presents a review of what is currentlyknown about the VMS, as well as some original ob-servations.
Although the manuscript raises severalquestions about its origin, authorship, the illustra-tions, etc., we focus on the text through questionsabout its properties.
These range from the level ofthe letter (for example, are there vowels and conso-nants?)
to the page (do pages have topics?)
to thedocument as a whole (are the pages in order?).?
This work was completed while the author was visitingthe Information Sciences Institute.2 Background2.1 HistoryFrom the illustrations ?
hairstyles and features of thehuman figures ?
as well as the shapes of the glyphs,the manuscript is posited to have been created in Eu-rope.
Carbon-dating at the University of Arizonahas found that the vellum was created in the 15thcentury, and the McCrone Research Institute has as-serted that the ink was added shortly afterwards1.The exact history of the VMS is not established.According to Zandbergen (2010), the earliest ownerthat it can be traced to is Jacobus de Tepenec inPrague in the early 1600s.
It is speculated that it wasgiven to him by Emperor Rudolf II, but it is unclearhow and from where the manuscript entered Prague.The VMS appears to have circulated in Prague forsome time, before being sent to Athanasius Kircherin Italy in 1665.
It remained in Italy until 1912,when it was sold to Wilfrid Voynich, who broughtit to America.
It was then sold to the bookdealerKraus, who later donated it to the Yale Universitylibrary2, where it is currently housed.2.2 OverviewThe manuscript is divided into quires ?
sectionsmade out of folded parchment, each of which con-sists of folios, with writing on both sides of each fo-lio (Reeds, 2002).
Including blank pages and pageswith no text, there are 240 pages, although it is be-lieved that some are missing (Pelling, 2006).
2251These results are as yet unpublished.
A paper about thecarbon-dating experiments is forthcoming in 2011.2High-resolution scans are available athttp://beinecke.library.yale.edu/digitallibrary/voynich.html78pages include text, and most are illustrated.
The textwas probably added after the illustrations, and showsno evidence of scratching or correction.The text is written left to right in paragraphs thatare left-aligned, justified, and divided by whitespaceinto words.
Paragraphs do not span multiple pages.A few glyphs are ambiguous, since they canbe interpreted as a distinct character, or a ligatureof two or more other characters.
Different tran-scriptions of the manuscript have been created,depending on various interpretations of the glyphs.We use a machine-readable transcription based onthe alphabet proposed by Currier (1976), editedby D?Imperio (1980) and others, made avail-able by the members of the Voynich ManuscriptMailing List (Gillogly and Reeds, 2005) athttp://www.voynich.net/reeds/gillogly/voynich.now.The Currier transcription maps the characters to theASCII symbols A-Z, 0-9, and *.
Under this tran-scription, the VMS is comprised of 225 pages, 8114word types, and 37919 word tokens.
Figure 1 showsa sample VMS page and its Currier transcription.2.3 Manuscript sectionsBased on the illustrations, the manuscript has tradi-tionally been divided into six sections: (1) herbal,containing drawings of plants; (2) Astronomical,containing zodiac-like illustrations; (3) Biological,mainly containing drawings of female human fig-ures; (4) Cosmological, consisting of circular illus-trations; (5) Pharmaceutical, containing drawing ofsmall containers and parts of plants, and (6) Stars(sometimes referred to as Recipes), containing verydense text with drawings of stars in the margins.Currier (1976) observed from letter and substringfrequencies that the text is comprised of two distinct?languages?, A and B. Interestingly, the Biologicaland Stars sections are mainly written in the B lan-guage, and the rest mainly in A.Using a two-state bigram HMM over the entiretext, we find that the two word classes induced byEM more or less correspond to the same division?
words in pages classified as being in the A lan-guage tend to be tagged as one class, and words inB language pages as the other, indicating that themanuscript does indeed contain two different vocab-ularies (which may be related languages, dialects, orsimply different textual domains).

Paragraph (but notline) breaks are indicated.79illustrate the division of the manuscript pages intothe six sections, and show the proportion of wordsin each page that are classified as the B language.For coherence, all our experimental results in therest of this paper are on the B language (which wedenote by VMS B) ?
specifically, the Biological andStars sections ?
unless otherwise specified.
Thesesections together contain 43 pages, with 3920 wordtypes, 17597 word tokens, and 35 characters.
Wecompare the VMS?s statistical properties with threenatural language texts of similar size: the first 28551words from the English Wall Street Journal Corpus,19327 words from the Arabic Quran (in Buckwaltertranscription), and 18791 words from the ChineseSinica Treebank.3 The Letter3.1 Are vowels and consonants represented?If a script is alphabetic, i.e., it uses approximatelyone character per phoneme, vowel and consonantcharacters can be separated in a fully unsupervisedway.
Guy (1991) applies the vowel-consonant sep-aration algorithm of (Sukhotin, 1962) on two pagesof the Biological section, and finds that four charac-ters (O, A, C, G) separate out as vowels.
However,the separation is not very strong, and several wordsdo not contain these characters.Another method is to use a two-state bigramHMM (Knight et al, 2006; Goldsmith and Xanthos,2009) over letters, and induce two clusters of letterswith EM.
In alphabetic languages like English, theclusters correspond almost perfectly to vowels andconsonants.
We find that a curious phenomenon oc-curs with the VMS ?
the last character of every wordis generated by one of the HMM states, and all othercharacters by another; i.e., the word grammar is a?b.There are a few possible interpretations of this.
Itis possible that the vowels from every word are re-moved and placed at the end of the word, but thismeans that even long words have only one vowel,which is unlikely.
Further, the number of voweltypes would be nearly half the alphabet size.
If thescript is a syllabary or a logograph, a similar clus-tering will surface, but given that there are only 35characters, it is unlikely that each of them representsa syllable or word.
A more likely explanation is thatthe script is an abjad, like the scripts of Semitic lan-guages, where all or most vowels are omitted.
In-deed, we find that a 2-state HMM on Arabic withoutdiacritics and English without vowels learns a simi-lar grammar, a?b+.3.2 Do letters have cases?Some characters (F, B, P, V) that appear mainly atparagraphs beginnings are referred to ?gallows?
?glyphs that are taller and more ornate than others.Among the glyphs, these least resemble Latin, lead-ing to the belief that they are null symbols, whichMorningstar (2001) refutes.Another hypothesis is that gallows are upper-case versions of other characters.
We defineBESTSUB(c) to be the character x that produces thehighest decrease in unigram word entropy when xis substituted for all instances of c. For English up-percase characters c, BESTSUB(c) is the lowercaseversion.
However, BESTSUB of the VMS gallowsis one of the other gallows!
This demonstrates thatthey are not uppercase versions of other letters, andalso that they are contextually similar to one another.3.3 Is there punctuation?We define punctuation as symbols that occur only atword edges, whose removal from the word results inan existing word.
There are two characters that areonly found at the ends of words (Currier K and L), butmost of the words produced by removing K and L arenot in the vocabulary.
Therefore, there is most likelyno punctuation, at least in the traditional sense.4 The Word4.1 What are the word frequency and lengthdistributions?The word frequency distribution follows Zipf?s law,which is a necessary (though not sufficient) test oflinguistic plausibility.
We also find that the unigramword entropy is comparable to the baseline texts (Ta-ble 1).Table 1: Unigram word entropy in bits.VMS B English Arabic Chinese9.666 10.07 9.645 10.31Several works have noted the narrow binomialdistribution of word lengths, and contrasted it with80Figure 2: VMS sections, and percentage of word tokens in each page that are tagged as language B by the HMM.the wide asymmetric distribution of English, Latin,and other European languages.
This contributed tospeculation that the VMS is not a natural language,but a code or generated by some other stochasticprocess.
However, Stolfi (2005) show that PinyinChinese, Tibetan, and Vietnamese word lengths fol-low a binomial distribution, and we found (Figure 3)that certain scripts that do not contain vowels, likeBuckwalter Arabic and devoweled English, have abinomial distribution as well.3 The similarity withdevoweled scripts, especially Arabic, reinforces thehypothesis that the VMS script may be an abjad.Figure 3: Word length distributions (word types).Landini (2001) found that the VMS follows Zipf?slaw of word lengths: there is an inverse relationshipbetween the frequency and length of a word.3This is an example of why comparison with a range oflanguages is required before making conclusions about thelanguage-like nature of a text.4.2 How predictable are letters within a word?Bennett (1976) notes that the second-order entropyof VMS letters is lower than most European lan-guages.
Stolfi (2005) computes the entropy of eachcharacter given the left and right contexts and findsthat it is low for most of the VMS text, particularlythe Biological section, compared to texts in otherlanguages.
He also ascertains that spaces betweenwords have extremely low entropy.We measure the predictability of letters, and com-pare it to English, Arabic, and Pinyin Chinese.
Pre-dictability is measured by finding the probabilitiesover a training set of word types, guessing the mostlikely letter (the one with the highest probability) ateach position in a word in the held-out test set, andcounting the proportion of times a guess is correct.Table 2 shows the predictability of letters as uni-grams, and given the preceding letter in a word (bi-grams).
VMS letters are more predictable than otherlanguages, with the predictability increasing sharplygiven the preceding contexts, similarly to Pinyin.Table 2: Predictability of letters, averaged over 10-foldcross-validation runs.VMS B English Arabic PinyinBigram 40.02% 22.62% 24.78% 38.92%Unigram 14.65% 11.09% 13.29% 11.20%Zandbergen (2010) computes the entropies ofcharacters at different positions in words in the Starssection, and finds that the 1st and 2nd characters of aword are more predictable than in Latin or Vulgate,but the 3rd and 4th characters are less predictable.81It has also been observed that word-final char-acters have much lower entropy compared to mostother languages ?
some characters appear almost ex-clusively at the ends of words.4.3 Is there morphological structure?The above observations suggest that words are madeup of morpheme-like chunks.
Several hypothesesabout VMS word structure have been proposed.
Tilt-man (1967) proposed a template consisting of rootsand suffixes.
Stolfi (2005) breaks down the morphol-ogy into ?prefix-midfix-suffix?, where the letters inthe midfixes are more or less disjoint from the let-ters in the suffixes and prefixes.
Stolfi later modifiedthis to a ?core-mantel-crust?
model, where words arecomposed of three nested layers.To determine whether VMS words have affixalmorphology, we run an unsupervised morphologi-cal segmentation algorithm, Linguistica (Goldsmith,2001), on the VMS text.
The MDL-based algo-rithm segments words into prefix+stem+suffix, andextracts ?signatures?, sets of affixes that attach to thesame set of stems.
Table 3 lists a few sample signa-tures, showing that stems in the same signature tendto have some structural similarities.Table 3: Some morphological signatures.Affixes StemsOE+, A3 AD AE AE9 AEOR AJ AM AN AR ATOP+, E O O2 OE OJ OM ON ORnull+ SAJ SAR SCC9 SCCO SCO2 SOOE+ BSC28 BSC9 CCC8 COC8CR FAEOEFAK FAU FC8 FC8AM FCC FCC2 FCC9RFCCAE FCCC2 FCCCAR9 FCO9 FCS9FCZAR FCZC9 OEAR9 OESC9 OF9 OR8SC29 SC89O SC8R SCX9 SQ9+89, 4OFCS 4OFCZ 4OFZ 4OPZ 8AES 8AEZ+9, 9FS 9PS EFCS FCS PS PZ+ C89 OEFS OF OFAES OFCS OFS OFZ5 Syntax5.1 Is there word order?One of the most puzzling features of the VMS is itsweak word order.
Notably, the text has very few re-peated word bigrams or trigrams, which is surpris-ing given that the unigram word entropy is com-parable to other languages.
Furthermore, there aresequences of two or more repeated words, or rep-etitions of very similar words.
For example, thefirst page of the Biological section contains the line4OFCC89 4OFCC89 4OFC89 4OFC89 4OFCC89 E89.We compute the predictability of a word given theprevious word (Table 4).
Bigram contexts only pro-vide marginal improvement in predictability for theVMS, compared to the other texts.
For comparisonwith a language that has ?weak word order?, we alsocompute the same numbers for the first 22766 wordtokens of the Hungarian Bible, and find that the em-pirical word order is not that weak after all.Table 4: Predictability of words (over 10-fold cross-validation) with bigram contexts, compared to unigrams.Unigram Bigram ImprovementVMS B 2.30% 2.50% 8.85%English 4.72% 11.9% 151%Arabic 3.81% 14.2% 252%Chinese 16.5% 19.8% 19.7%Hungarian 5.84% 13.0% 123%5.2 Are there latent word classes?While there are very few repeated word bigrams,perhaps there are latent classes of words that gov-ern word order.
We induce ten word classes using abigram HMM trained with EM (Figure 4).
As withthe stems in the morphological signatures, the wordsin each class show some regularities ?
although itis hard to quantify the similarities ?
suggesting thatthese latent classes are meaningful.Currier (1976) found that some word-initial char-acters are affected by the word-final characters ofthe immediately preceding word.
He concludes thatthe ?words?
being syllables or digits would explainthis phenomenon, although that is unlikely given therarity of repeated sequences.We redo the predictability experiments of the pre-vious section, using the last m letters of the previousword to predict the first n letters of the current word.When n > 2, improvement in predictability remainslow.
However, when n is 1 or 2, there is a noticeableimprovement when using the last few characters ofthe previous word as contexts (Table 5).5.3 Are there long-distance word correlations?Weak bigram word order can arise if the text isscrambled or is generated by a unigram process.
Al-ternately, the text might have been created by inter-82Figure 4: Some of the induced latent classes.

at dis-tance d, measured as the average pointwise mutualinformation over all pairs of words w1, w2 that occurmore than once at distance d apart.
VMS words donot show significant long-distance correlations.6 The Page6.1 Do pages have topics?That is, do certain words ?burst?
with a high fre-quency within a page, or are words randomly dis-tributed across the manuscript?
Figure 6 shows a vi-sualization of the TF-IDF values of words in a VMSB page, where the ?documents?
are pages, indicatingthe relevance of each word to the page.
Also shownis the same page in a version of the document createdby scrambling the words of the original manuscript,and repaginating to the same page lengths.
This sim-ulates a document where words are generated inde-pendent of the page, i.e., the pages have no topics.Figure 5: Long-range collocationness.
Arabic showsstronger levels of long-distance correlation compared toEnglish and Chinese.
VMS B shows almost no correla-tions for distance d > 1.To quantify the degree to which a page containstopics, we measure the entropy of words within thepage, and denote the overall ?topicality?
T of a doc-ument as the average entropy over all the pages.
Asa control, we compute the topicality Trand of thescrambled version of the document.

T/Trandindicates the extent to which the pages of the docu-ment contain topics.
Table 6 shows that by this mea-sure, the VMS?s strength of page topics is less thanthe English texts, but more than the Quran4, signify-ing that the pages probably do have topics, but arenot independent of one another.6.2 Is the text prose?Visually, the text looks like prose written in para-graphs.
However, Currier (1976) stated that ?the line4We demarcate a ?page?
to be approximately 25 verses forthe Quran, a chapter for the Genesis, and an article for the WSJ.83Figure 6: TF-IDF visualization of page f108v in the Stars section.

that is, there are patterns tolines on the page that are uncharacteristic of prose.In particular, certain characters or sequences appearalmost exclusively at the beginnings or ends of lines.Figure 7 shows the distribution of characters atline-edges, relative to their occurrences at wordbeginnings or endings,confirming Currier?s obser-vation.
It is particularly interesting that lower-frequency characters occur more at line-ends, andhigher-frequency ones at the beginnings of lines.Schinner (2007) found that characters show long-range correlations at distances over 72 characters,which is a little over the average line length.7 The Document7.1 Are the pages in order?We measure the similarity between two pages as thecosine similarity over bags of words, and count theproportion of pages Pi where the page Pi?1 or Pi+1is the most similar page to Pi.
We denote this mea-sure by ADJPAGESIM.
If ADJPAGESIM is high, itindicates that (1) the pages are not independent ofeach other and (2) the pages are in order.Table 7 shows ADJPAGESIM for the VMS andother texts.
As expected, ADJPAGESIM is close tozero for the VMS with pages scrambled, as well asthe WSJ, where each page is an independent article,and is highest for the VMS, particularly the B pages.Table 7: ADJPAGESIM for VMS and other texts.VMS B 38.8%VMS All 15.6%VMS B pages scrambled 0%VMS All pages scrambled 0.444%WSJ 1.34%English Genesis 25.0%Arabic Quran 27.5%This is a convincing argument for the pages be-ing mostly in order.
However, the non-contiguityof the herbal and pharmaceutical sections and theinterleaving of the A and B languages indicatesthat larger chunks of pages were probably re-ordered.
In addition, details involving illustrationsand ink-transfer across pages point to a few local re-orderings (Pelling, 2006).7.2 How many authors were involved?Currier (1976) observed that the distinction betweenthe A and B languages corresponds to two differenttypes of handwriting, implying at least two authors.He claimed that based on finer handwriting analysis,there may have been as many as eight scribes.8 Latin, Cipher, or Hoax?Claims of decipherment of the VMS script havebeen surfacing for several years, none of which areconvincing.
Newbold (1928) believed that micro-scopic irregularities of glyph edges correspond toanagrammed Latin.
Feely in 1943 proposed that thescript is a code for abbreviated Latin (D?Imperio,1980).
Sherwood (2008) believes that the wordsare coded anagrams of Italian.
Others have hypoth-84Figure 7: Proportion of word-edge characters at line-edges for lines that span the width of the page.

Theword length distribution and other properties haveinvoked decodings into East Asian languages likeManchu (Banasik, 2004).
These theories tend to relyon arbitrary anagramming and substitutions, and arenot falsifiable or well-defined.The mysterious properties of the text and its resis-tance to decoding have led some to conclude that itis a hoax ?
a nonsensical string made to look vaguelylanguage-like.
Rugg (2004) claims that words mighthave been generated using a ?Cardan Grille?
?
away to deterministically generate words from a ta-ble of morphemes.
However, it seems that the Grilleemulates a restricted finite state grammar of wordsover prefixes, midfixes, and suffixes.
Such a gram-mar underlies many affixal languages, including En-glish.
Martin (2008) proposes a method of generat-ing VMS text from anagrams of number sequences.Like the previous paper, it only shows that thismethod can create VMS-like words ?
not that it isthe most plausible way of generating the manuscript.It is also likely that the proposed scheme can be usedto generate any natural language text.Schinner (2007) votes for the hoax hypothesisbased on his observations about characters showinglong-range correlations, and the geometric distribu-tion of the probability of similar words repeating ata fixed distance.
These observations only confirmthat the VMS has some properties unlike natural lan-guage, but not that it is necessarily a hoax.9 ConclusionWe have detailed various known properties of theVoynich manuscript text.
Some features ?
the lackof repeated bigrams and the distributions of letters atline-edges ?
are linguistically aberrant, which others?
the word length and frequency distributions, theapparent presence of morphology, and most notably,the presence of page-level topics ?
conform to natu-ral language-like text.It is our hope that this paper will motivate re-search into understanding the manuscript by schol-ars in computational linguistics.
The questions pre-sented here are obviously not exhaustive; a deeperexamination of the statistical features of the text incomparison to a number of scripts and languages isneeded before any definite conclusions can be made.Such studies may also inspire a quantitative interestin linguistic and textual typologies, and be applica-ble to the decipherment of other historical scripts.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewersand our colleagues at ISI and Chicago for their help-ful suggestions.
