This has led tn a bulk of work deal-ing with varinus forms of cohesimt-preserving lan-guage mechanisms, lnainly in the field of anaphora,which contribute to connectivity among sentences.From the focus on these linguistic phenomena onemight obtain a misleading picture of textual connectiv-ity, viz.
one that considers it basically as a 'fiat', con-tinuous treanl of formally connected utterances lackingadditional structure.
Far less research as been devntedto the intemM organization of cohesive utteranccs bymechanisms ata more global level of dialog/text archi-tecture, the level of text coherence.Major computational pproaches rclated to co-.herence aspects within a dialog processing frameworkam due to Reichman's \[1978\], McKcown's \[19851 andScha & Polmlyi's \[19881 lbnnalizations of diatog gram-mars.

23-28, 1992collected empirical evidence for this claim through in-vestigations of texts from diverse domains \[Giora1983a, Kurzon 1984\].
This coincides with the general-ity of use of most coherence relations, but is in sharpcontrast to the highly constrained and domain-depend-ent model of superstructures and story grammars.
(4) Major thematic progression pattems are correlatedwith particular search styles and retrieval modes in full-text information systems.
Hence, providing typed co-herence operators inherently supports graphics-baseduser interactions with the TOPIC system in terms of ad-vanced conceptual orientation and navigation tools forsemantically guided text graph tours (see section 5.3).
(5) The investigation of thematic progression pattemsis of value in its own methodological right.
They con-stitute a basic structural model of text macro organiza-tion as opposed to model-theoretic and plan/goal-basedapproaches (a distinction made by Pustejovsky \[1987\]).As such they might complement current ext under-standing methodologies whose emphasis, o far, hasbeen on fairly knowledge-expensive assertional models(such as coherence relations and text macro proposi-tions) or stereotyped text-semantical models (such assuperstructures and story grammars).2 MOTIVATING THE NEED FOR TEXTCOHERENCE PARSINGTbe model of text structure parsing we propose draws acareful distinction between text cohesion and text coher-ence phenomena.
As to the illustration of text cohesionmechatfisms in natural language texts, consider the fol-lowing text passage:\[1\] The De/taX from ZetaMachineslnc.
is a computersystem that mns Unix V.3.\[21 ~h.e_Lw\[9~ is based on a 68020 processor.\[3\] It has a 12-inch monochrome display and an integratedtelephone handset and built-in modem.\[4\] Internally, there's a 40-megabyte hard disk, a 1.2-megabyte 51/4-inch floppy disk drive, 4.5 megabytesof RAM, three RS-232C ports, and an S T-506 port.Repeated occurrences of various text cohesion phenom-ena are illustrated by nominal anaphora (7"he system'in \[2\]), pronominal naphora ('/t' in \[3\]), both referringto the unique antecedent Delta-X (in \[1\]), while '/n-ternally, there's a ... hard disk" (in \[4\]) is linked toDelta-X via textual ellipsis.
The basic cohesion amongthese sentences yields the common thematic back-ground for constantly elaborating on a single topic(Delta-X).
An appropriate text parser should, first ofall, recognize these multiple cohesion phenomena andproduce something like the following representationstructures (indicated by \[...\]R):I I\]R l)elta-X < manufacturer: {ZetaMachines Inc. } >Delta-X < operating system: { Unix V,3 } >\[21R Delta-X < CPU: { 68020 } >13}R Delta-X < peripheral devices: { 12-inch monochrome display } >Delta+X < peripheral devices: { telephune handset \] >Delta-X < e~tmunicat ion devices: { modem } >14\]R Delta-X < external storage devices: { 40-megabyte hard disk } >Delta-X < external storage devices:{ 1.2-megabyte 51/4-inch floppy disk drive } >Delta-X < main memory: { 4.5 megabytes of RAM } >Deha-X < ports: { 3 RS-232C ports } >Deha-X < ports: { ST-506 port } >Ac'r~!s DE COL ING-92 ,  NArcl'l~s, 23-28 AoC-r 1992 26What is still lacking is a representation facility whichcharacterizes this sequence of single assertions con-stantly referring to a single topic (Delta-X) as constitut-ing a coherent whole.
Recognizing linguistic forms oftext coherency and providing appropriate thematicgrouping operators for text knowledge bases is whattext coherence parsing mainly is about.
Even if parserswould perfectly recognize and normalize all occurrencesof text cohesion phenomena in texts, missing recogni-tion capabilities for text coherence phenomena wouldnevertheless produce under-structured, incoherent textknowledge bases in the sense that global pragmatic n-dicatops of discourse bracketing would be lacking.3 BASIC TEXT COHERENCE PATTERNSIn this section, we informally describe the basic pat-terns of text coherence focused on in this paper.
Ac-cording to Danes \[1974\] three categories of thematicdevelopments can be distinguished:~1 Constant Theme.
This pattern is characterized bythe con.~tant elaboration of one specific topic withina text (passage) by considering several of its concep-tual facets.
The following two paragraphs serve toillustrate this major pattern of thematic progression(the reference points to the constant theme (Delta-X) are indicated by italics):\[TI.

Incontrast to constant themes, this pattern realizes acontinuous hift of topics (visualized by bold ital-ics).
The process tarts with a theme and ,some com-ment on that theme which we shall call theme (actu-?
ally, an elaboration on one of its conceptual facets).Now this rheme is focused on as the next theme thatis elaborated by a corresponding rheme, etc.:IT1.2\].

Basically (see Figure 1), theseare constituted by the PARSE BULLETIN, a black-board-type memory which records the single events ofthe parsing process, the DOMAIN KNOWLEDGEBASE, which contains file domain-specific backgroundknowledge needed for the parse, and various EXPER~Psfor actually driving the parse through the text grammarspecifications they incorporate (cf.
tlahn \[1990\] for amore comprehensive presentation).The PARSE BULLETIN has a flat list struc.ture.
It records the sequence of text tokens as they ap-pear in the text and, if relevant (see below), notes theirclass identifiers (FRAME item, ADJective, etc.).
Moreimlxmant, cox~structivc parsing activities based on oper-ations of the knowledge base and the parser are indi-cated at ~ver',d positions (so-called parse points) in thePARSE BULLETIN.
The type of operation being per-formed is indicated by a particular parse descriptor.Some are internal to the management of the knowledgebase, e.g., DEFACF (default concept activation), whileothers indicate grammatical relations recognized by tileparser, such as NounA'Vl' (conccptu~d attribution rela-tions between ouns), AdjA'FI' (conceptual ttributionrelations between adjectives and nouns).
The items alZlcctcd by an operation lorm a so-called parse mple.The parser does not consider every token it re-ceives from the input text at the same level of detail.Instead, it distinguishes between words which am sig-nilicant to its performance (conceptually relevant ones,such as nouns or arljcctives which denote concepts inthe domain knowledge base, or linguistically relevantones, such as negation particles, certain conjtmctions,quantiliers, etc.
), and tho~ that are not (anrong them awide variety of semantically indifferent nouns, verbs,particles, etc., each of which is assigned the class iden-tifier NIL).
The latter are simply discarded from furtheranalysis, while the fom~er arc assigned lexicalizedgrammar spccificafiorts.
The parser h~s thus been tunedtowards partialparsing in a spirit similar to that advo-cated by Schank ct al.

Them sioLs are as-sociated with two different kinds of slot fillers.
Permitted slot fillers are enclomd in square brackets, \[a-framonamo\], which characterizes the range of possible slotfillers by ,all those fr~mles which ale a sulx)rdinate or aninstance of framo name.
Actual slot fillers are enclosedin curly braces and can be taken as facts either knowna prk)ri to ll~c system or acquired continuously from thetext as its understanding proceeds during file parm.In addition, each concept has attached to it an a.
'~tivation weight counter.
The values of the weight fac~\[ors are enclosed by vertical bars attached to each item;if no bars explicitly occur, a zero weight is assumed.Activation weights arc incremented (starting from zero-level activation) whenever a noun denoting its associ-ated concept occurs in the text, and whenever structure-building operations in KB aflect that concept.

This contains a description of the par's-ing results of the first paragraph of text \ [T I .1 \ ] .
Theentries in the PARSE BULLETIN have been workedout by experts for linguistic phenomena on tile locallevel of phrasal, sentence and text cohesion analysis.For the propose of constant heme computation, weneed only consider those entries whose pat.se descriptordesignates manipulations of slots or slot values of someframe (LC*-typc descriptors, uch as NounATT or Adj-A'FF).
Other descriptors are irrelevant here and havebeen left out on purlx)se in Figure 1.
From this we con-struct the set THEMES.
It consists of triples ( J?ame,slot, bullpos ) where frame is file name of a frame, andslot is the name of a slot of that frame, both co-occur-ring as lexical parameters of some parse tuple in thePARSE BULLETIN with a LC*-typc pal~e descriptor;bullpos gives file parse point in file PARSE BULLETINwhere frwne mid slot occur iustzmtancously.

Again, prepos-- 000, but due to the new testpos parameter newpos isnow in the interval \[40, 54\].
The evaluation of con-stant-theme( 055, 039 ) starts with a proper choice ofnewpos = 054. testpos+ l excludes 68000-1 (68000-2)from further consideration.
Finally, we obtaincor~t~nt-theme( 055, 039 ) = ( Delta-X,{i /o devices, peripheral devices, communication devices},054)Note that the occurrence of display-I at parse point'046' does not conflict with criterion (g), since we alsohave Delta-X (thematically related to i/o devices "andperipheral devices) at that parse point (cf criterion g(z)).Since the end of the paragraph as been reached, thecoherence computation process hails.Figure 3 represents the effects of grouping acon-stant heme and the themes referred to in the text pas-sage (cf.

3 Post-Conditions Holding with respect o a ConstantTheme Pattern5.2 Remarks  on Continuous Thematizationof Rhemes and Derived ThemeSimilarily, formal descriptions have been worked outfor the other two basic text coherence patterns mention-ed above.
Instead of a full treatment, we give two ratherinformal sketches of the underlying regularities as theyhave been incorporated into our framework.
Contitm-ous thematization of rhemes most significantly departsfrom the constant theme schema just outlined (in fact,both are mutually exclusive) in that the former incorpo-rates a continuous shift of the topics being considered.Figure 4 illustrates this permanent change of issues in atext.
The PARSE BULLETIN contains a sequence oflocal theme-theme pairs withframeTi  being tile currentlocal theme and slotftllerTi being its associated localrheme.
Text coherence isdue to the fact that the currentlocal theme (slotfillerTi) becomes the next localtheme (framerl+l).
This rheme-specific connectivitycriterion is stressed by the double-sided black arrows inthe DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE BASE which link the im-mediately preceding theme to its identical theme succes-Acrl~.s DE COL lNG-92 ,  NAM'ES, 23-28 ho~r  1992 3 0sor, while local theme-theme connections are indicatedby the one-sided grey arrows which go l~om the localtheme to its associated local tl~eme.
A sequence of localtheme-theme pairs fulfilling the rheme-specilic conuec-tivity criterion in terms of overlapping palmneters (cur-rent rheme becomes next theme) constitutes what isItem called cont inuous thematization of rhemes,i.e.

IF igu re  4 The General Contiouous Thematization of RhemesConfiguration PatternAn illustration is given by text fragment \[T 1.2 \] in sec-tion 3 where bold italics stress the emerging lobaltheme-rheme cluster constituted by tile following se-quence of overlapping local theme-theme pairs:Delta-X - nmntffacturer- ZetaMachines Inc.,ZetaMachines Inc. - product- Gamma-Z,Gamraa-Z - architecture- Conn. Machine architecture,Conn.
Machine architecture - developer-D. HillisThe third pattern further generalizes the results ofthe afore-going coherence computations on the para-graph level and extends them over various (adjacent)paragraphs and possibly over the whole text.
Considera series of paragraphs, each one dealing exclusivelywith one special topic (see Figure 5 below).
The firstparagraph deals with f rame T 1, tile second one elabo-rates onframeT2, etc.
A derived theme can be com-puted when all these different (sub)topics all be linkedto the most specific general (super)topic (frameT).
Intechnical terms, these subtopics are all instances of thatPtu)c,  ov COL ING-92 ,  NANTES, AUG. 23-28,  1992supertopic.Text \[T2\] illustrates Otis pllenomenon: thereare three paragraphs whose major topics arc Delta-X,Gamma-Z, and Sigma-P; a conceptual generalizationstep links them to the derived theme work, s'tation.
InFigure 5 this relationship is indicated by thc arrowspointing fi'om each subtopic (of a single paragraptt) toits supertopic, thematically characterizing these para-graphs on a more general evel of conceptualization.

In particular, we observed a close funclional re-lationship between the selection of particular coherencepatterns and particular search states during the retrievalprocess which is performed on network representationsof text summaries, so-called text graptLs:1) Constant Theme coherently characterizesavari-ety of facts related to one particular topic.
A CT-basedsearch operation enhances the user ~ knowledge of thattopic by presenting facets (or data related to those fac-ets) the user is probably not aware of, although theymay be relevant o the solution of his or her problem.2) Continuous Thematization of Rhemes linlc,;aset of formerly unrelated topics by a coherent line ofconceptual dependencies (cunent rheme becomes nexttheme).

).6 F INA l ,  REMARKSIn this paper, a structural model of text coherence com~putation has been proposed that strongly exploits theknowledge chunking inherent to fi~ame representations.These prccompiled knowledge structures are irtstantiat-cd by the topical evolution of a text ax represented in theparser's bulletin.
Tiros, various coherence phenomemtcan be distinguished by particular instantiation pattents:f3 constant theme is defined by multiple instantia-fions of aggregatiou (or conceptual association) re-lations for one particular f'r',une item in KB;ffl continuous thematization of rhemes is deiinoed by multiple instantiations of aggregation rela-tions for continuously changing, though locallyoverlapping frame items in KB;\[-J derived theme is defined by multiple instantia-tions of generalization/classilication relations hold-ing between subparts of a frame hierarchy in KB.A more  e laborated  fo rmal  descr ip t ion  o f  this  mode l  - int : lnd ingthose parts wh ich  cou ld  on ly  be treated ra ther  sketch i ly  in thiscont r ibut ion  - is given in l l a lm \ [1991\] .
