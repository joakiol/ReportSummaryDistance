johnca@cogs.susx.ac.ukAbstractKnowledge Technologies need to extractknowledge from existing texts, whichcalls for advanced Human LanguageTechnologies (HLT).
Progress is beingmade in Natural Language Processing butthere is still a long way towards NaturalLanguage Understanding.
An importantstep towards this goal is the developmentof technologies and resources that dealwith concepts rather than words.
TheMEANING project argues that we need tosolve two complementary andintermediate tasks to enable the nextgeneration of intelligent open domainHLT application systems: Word SenseDisambiguation and large-scaleenrichment of Lexical Knowledge Bases.Innovations in this area will lead to HLTwith deeper understanding of texts, andimmediate progress in real applications ofKnowledge Technologies.IntroductionThe field of Information Society Technologies(IST) is one of the main thematic priorities ofthe European Commission for the 6th Frameworkprogramme.
In this field, KnowledgeTechnologies (KT) aim to provide meaning tothe petabytes of information content oursocieties will generate in the near future.Information and knowledge managementsystems need to evolve accordingly, to enablethe next generation of intelligent open domainHuman Language Technologies (HLT) that willdeal with the growing potential of theknowledge-rich and multilingual society.In order to develop a trustable semantic webinfrastructure and a multilingual ontologyframework to support knowledge management awide range of techniques are required toprogressively automate the knowledge lifecycle.In particular, this involves extracting high-levelmeaning from the large collections of contentdata and its representation and management in acommon knowledge base.Even now, building large and rich knowledgebases takes a great deal of expensive manualeffort; this has severely hampered Knowledge-Technologies and HLT application development.For example, dozens of person-years have beeninvest into the development of wordnets1 forvarious languages, but the data in theseresources is still not sufficiently rich to supportadvanced concept-based HLT applicationsdirectly.
Furthermore, resources produced byintrospection usually fail to register what reallyoccurs in texts.
Applications will not scale up toworking in the open domain without moredetailed and rich general-purpose, which shouldperhaps include domain-specific linguisticknowledge.The MEANING project identifies twocomplementary intermediate tasks which wethink are crucial in order to enable the nextgeneration of intelligent open domain HLTapplication systems: Word SenseDisambiguation (WSD) and large-scaleenrichment of Lexical Knowledge Bases.1 A wordnet is a conceptually structured knowledgebase of word senses.
The English WordNet (Miller90, Fellbaum 98) has been developed at PrincetonUniversity over the past 14 years.
EuroWordNet(Vossen 1998) is a multilingual database withwordnets for several European languages (Dutch,Italian, Spanish, German, French, Czech andEstonian).
Balkanet is building wordnets for theBalkan languages following the EuroWordNetdesign.The advance in these two areas will allow forlarge-scale extractions of shallow meaning fromtexts, in the form of relations among concepts.WSD provides the technology to convertrelations between words into relations betweenconcepts.
Rich and large-scale LexicalKnowledge Bases will have be the repositoriesof extracted relations and other linguisticknowledge.However, progress is difficult due to thefollowing interdependence:?
In order to achieve accurate WSD, we needfar more linguistic and semantic knowledgethan is available in current lexicalknowledge bases (e.g.
current wordnets).?
In order to enrich Lexical Knowledge Baseswe need to acquire information fromcorpora, which have been accurately taggedwith word senses.Providing innovative technology to solve thisproblem will be one of the main challenges toaccess KTs.Following this introduction section 1 presentsthe major research goals in HLT.
Section 2presents the MEANING roadmap.
Finally,section 4 draws the conclusions.1 Major research goals in HLTIn order to extend the state-of-the-art in humanlanguage technologies (HLT) future researchmust devise: (1) innovative processes and toolsfor automatic acquisition of lexical knowledgefrom large-scale document collections; (2) noveltechniques for accurately selecting the sense ofopen-class words in a large number oflanguages; (3) ways to enrich existingmultilingual linguistic knowledge resources withnew kinds of lexical information byautomatically mapping information acrosslanguages.
We present each one in turn.1.1 Dealing with knowledge acquisitionThe acquisition of linguistic knowledge fromcorpora has been a very successful line ofresearch.
Research in the acquisition ofsubcategorization information, selectionalpreferences, in thematic role assignments anddiathesis alternations (Agirre and Mart?nez2001, 2002, McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998;Korhonen et al, 2000; McCarthy 2001), domaininformation (Magnini and Cavagli?
2000), topicsignatures (Agirre et al 2001b), lexico-semanticrelations between words (Agirre et al 2002) etc.has obtained encouraging results.
Theacquisition process usually involves large bodiesof text, which have been previously processedwith shallow language processors.Much of the use of the acquired knowledgehas been hampered by the fact that the texts arenot sense-disambiguated, and therefore, onlyknowledge for words can be acquired, that is,subcategorization for words, selectionalpreferences for words, etc.
It is a wellestablished fact that much of the linguisticbehavior of words can be better explained if it iskeyed to word senses.For instance, the subcategorization frames ofverbs are highly dependent of the sense of theverb.
Some senses of a given verb allow for aparticular combination of complements, whileothers do not (McCarthy, 2001).
The same isapplicable to selectional preferences; traditionalapproaches that learn selectional preferences fora verb, tend to mix e.g.
all subjects for differentssenses, even if verbs can have differentselectional preferences for each word sense(Agirre & Martinez, 2002).Having texts automatically sense-tagged withhigh accuracy will produce significantly betteracquired knowledge at a sense level, includingsubcategorization frequencies, domaininformation, topic signatures, selectionalpreferences, specific lexico-semantic relations,thematic role assignments and diathesisalternations.
It will also facilitate theinvestigation on automatic methods for dealingwith new senses not present in current wordnetsand clustering of word senses.
Furthermore,linguistic information keyed to word senses thatare linked to interlingual concepts (as proposedin the EuroWordNet model), can be easilyintegrated in a multilingual Lexical KnowledgeBase (cf.
section 2.3)2.2 Dealing with WSDWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the taskof assigning the appropriate meaning (sense) to agiven word in a text or discourse.
Ide andVeronis (1998) argue that word sense ambiguityis a central problem for many established HLTapplications (for example Machine Translation,Information Extraction and InformationRetrieval).
This is also the case for associatedsub-tasks (i.e.
reference resolution and parsing).For this reason many international researchgroups are working on WSD, using a wide rangeof approaches.
However, no large-scale broad-coverage accurate WSD system has been builtup to date2.
With current state-of-the-artaccuracy in the range 60-70%, WSD is one ofthe most important open problems in NaturalLanguage Processing.A promising current line of research usessemantically annotated corpora to train MachineLearning (ML) algorithms to decide which wordsense to choose in which contexts.
The words inthese annotated corpora are tagged manuallywith semantic classes taken from a particularlexical semantic resource (most commonlyWordNet).
Many standard ML techniques havebeen tried, such as Bayesian learning, Exemplarbased learning, Decision Lists, and recentlymargin-based classifiers like Boosting andSupport Vector Machines (Escudero et al,2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2000d, 2001; Mart?nezand Agirre, 2000).
These approaches are termed"supervised" because they learn from previouslysense annotated data and therefore they require alarge amount of human intervention to annotatethe training data.Supervised WSD systems are data hungry.They suffer from the "knowledge acquisitionbottleneck", it takes them mere seconds to digestall of the processed corpus contained in trainingmaterials that take months to annotate manually.So, although Machine Learning classifiers areundeniably effective, they are not feasible untilwe can obtain reliable unsupervised trainingdata.
Ng (1997) estimates that the manualannotation effort necessary to build a broadcoverage word-sense annotated English corpusis about 16 person-years; and this effort wouldhave to be replicated for each different language.Unfortunately, many people think that Ng?sestimate might fell short, as the annotated corpusthus produced is not guaranteed to enable highaccuracy WSD.Some recent work is focusing on reducingthe acquisition cost and the need for supervision2 See the conclusions of the SENSEVAL-2competition: http://www.sle.sharp.co.uk/senseval2/in corpus-based methods for WSD.
Leacock etal.
(1998) and Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999)automatically generate arbitrarily large corporafor unsupervised WSD training, using thesynonyms or definitions of word sensesprovided in WordNet to formulate search enginequeries over the Web.
In another line ofresearch, (Yarowsky, 1995) and (Blum andMitchell, 1998) have shown that it is possible toreduce the need for supervision with the help oflarge amounts of unannotated data.
Applyingthese ideas, (Agirre and Mart?nez, 2000) hasdeveloped knowledge-based prototypes forobtaining accurate examples from the web forspecific WordNet synsets, as well as, largequantities of unannotated examples.But in order to make significant advances inWSD system accuracy, systems need to be ableto use types of lexical knowledge that are notcurrently available in wide-coverage lexicalknowledge bases: for example subcategorisationfrequencies for predicates (particularly verbs)rely on word senses, selectional preferences ofpredicates for classes of arguments, amongstothers (Carroll and McCarthy, 2000; McCarthyet al, 2001; Agirre and Mart?nez, 2002;).2.3 Dealing with multilingualismLanguage diversity is at the same time avaluable cultural heritage worth preserving, andan obstacle to achieving a more cohesive socialand economic development.
This situation hasbeen further stressed as a major challenge in ISTresearch lines.
Improving languagecommunication capabilities is a prerequisite forincreasing industrial competitiveness, this wayleading to a sound growth in key economicsectors.However, this obstacle can be helpfulbecause all languages realize the meaning indifferent ways.
We can benefit from this factusing a novel multilingual mapping process thatexploits the EuroWordNet architecture.
InEuroWordNet local wordnets are linked via anInter-Lingual-Index (ILI) allowing theconnection from words in one language totranslation equivalent words in any of the otherlanguages.
In that way, technological advancesin one language can help the other.For instance, for Basque, being anagglutinative language with very richmorphological-syntactic information, it ispossible to extract semantic relations that wouldbe more difficult to capture in other languages.Below we can see an example of the relationbetwewen silversmith and silver, extracted fromthe Basque words zilargile ?
zilar respectively.This relation has been disambiguated into the?maker_of?
lexico-semantic relation (Agirre &Lersundi, 2000).On the contrary, Basque is not largely presentin the web as the others.
Using this approach it ispossible to balance both gaps.Although the technology to providecompatibility across wordnets exits (Daud?
et al1999, 2000, 2001), new research is needed forporting and uploading the various types ofknowledge across languages, and new ways totest the validity of the ported knowledge in thetarget languages.3.
The MEANING RoadmapThe improvements mentioned above have beenexplored separately with relative success.
Infact, no research group in isolation has tried tocombine all this aforementioned factors.
Wedesigned the MEANING project3 convinced thatonly a combination of all relevant knowledgeand resources will be able to produce significantadvances in this crucial research area.MEANING will treat the web as a (huge)corpus to learn information from, since even thelargest conventional corpora available (e.g.
theReuters corpus, the British National Corpus) arenot large enough to be able to acquire reliableinformation in sufficient detail about languagebehaviour.
Moreover, most languages do nothave large or diverse enough corpora available.MEANING proposes an innovativebootstrapping process to deal with the inter-dependency between WSD and knowledgeacquisition:1.
Train accurate WSD systems and applythem to very large corpora by couplingknowledge-based techniques on the existingEuroWordNet (e.g.
to populate it withdomain labels, to induce automatically3 Started in March 2002, MEANING IST-2001-34460 "Developing Multilingual Web-scaleLanguage Technologies" is a three years researchproject funded by the EC.training examples) with ML techniques thatcombine very large amounts of labeled andunlabeled data.
When ready, use also theknowledge acquired in 2.2.
Use the obtained accurate WSD data inconjunction with shallow parsing techniquesand domain tagging to extract new linguisticknowledge to incorporate intoEuroWordNet.This method will be able to break thisinterdependency in a series of cycles thanks tothe fact that the WSD system will be based onall domain information, sophisticated linguisticknowledge, large numbers of automaticallytagged examples from the web, and acombination of annotated and unannotated data.The first WSD system will have weakerlinguistic knowledge, but the sole combinationof the rest of the factors will produce significantperformance gains.
Besides, some of therequired linguistic knowledge can be acquiredfrom unnanotated data, and can therefore beacquired without using any WSD system.
Onceacceptable WSD is available, the acquiredknowledge will be of a higher quality, and willallow for better WSD performance.Multilingualism will be also helpful forMEANING.
The idiosyncratic way the meaningis realised in a particular language will becaptured and ported to the rest of languagesinvolved in the project4 using EuroWordNet as aMultilingual Central Repository in threeconsecutive phases (see figure 1).For instance, selectional preferences acquiredfor verb senses based on the English corpora,can be uploaded into the Multilingual CentralRepository.
As the selectional prefenrecerelation is keyed to concepts in the repository,this knowledge can be ported to the otherlanguages.
Of course, the ported knowledgeneeds to be checked in order to evaluate thevalidity of this approach.Below, we can see the selectional preferencefor the first sense of know from (Agirre &martinez, 2002).
The first sense of know isunivocally linked to <know, cognize,cognise>, which in EuroWordNet is linked to4 MEANING will work with three major Europeanlanguages (English, Spanish and Italian) and twominority languages (Catalan and Basque).wSaBs000004WsmpmceMultilingual Central RepositoryEANING is going to constitutewledge resource for a number ofsses that need large amounts ofto be effective tools (e.g.
