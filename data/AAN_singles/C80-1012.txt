In t roduct ionWhen we look up l inguist ic  theor iesof sentence-  or even of text -semant icsto see what  they can offer  in respectto word -mean ing ,  we wi l l  be conf rontedwith bas ica l ly  two types F ILLMORE /3/has referred to as check l i s t - semant icsand proto type-semant ics .

quest ion ingfrom which sources and by what  proce-dures the data necessary  for theircompos i t ion  were acquired,  we wi l linvar iab ly  come accross  the ind iv idualana lysts ' ,  or group of analysts '  ownassumedly  comprehens ive  and re l iab leknowledge of the wor ld and/or  thenatura l  language system concerned.
Inthe major i ty  of cases,  these wi l l  nothave been made access ib le  by inter-sub ject ive ly  def ined operat ions  butrather  by way of intu i t ive in t rospec-tion.
In do ing so, l inguists  tend tomake use of word -mean ing  instead ofana lys ing  it when they set up matr i cesfor component ia l  analys is  or def inesemant ic  networks.
Apart  from tentat ivedepar tures  wi th in  generat ive  semant icsor s tat i s t i ca l  indexing,  there have nooperat iona l  procedures  yet  been dev isedfor the semant ic  analys is  and descr ip -t ion of natura l  language terms as aresu l t  of which - when appl ied tonatural  language d i scourse  - a lex ica ls t ructure may be obtained.Now, this is what  word -semant icsshould and could do, and where exact lythe problems begin.2.
Ep is tomologyIf we agree that l ingu is t ics  is, orat least  ought  to be, an empir ica ld i sc ip l ine ,  then the parad igm of empi -r ical  sc iences should be fo l lowed,a l though it needs mod i f i ca t ion  in v iewof the scope of natura l  language seman-tics.To adopt  the parad igm of empi r ica lsc iences for l inguist ic  research istantamount  to at least  two postu lates :a) not  to re ly on ready-made theor iesor models  taken from another  domain,because these may be inadequate inrespect  to the phenomena under in-vest igat ion;  and76b) not to rely on the introspectiveexploration of one's own knowledgeand competence as the al legedly in-exhaustible datasource although va-luable initial ideas might be prod-uced that way.Instead, the investigation of lin-guistic problems in general, andthat of word -semantics in particu-lar, should start with hypothesesformulated for continuous estimationand/or testing against observable data,then proceed to incorporate the find-ings tentatively in some prel iminarytheoretical set up which finally mayperhaps get formalized to become partof an encompassing theory.Within such a set up, the formalexpressions which give an abstract re-presentation of the domain, and thenumerical expressions which give aquantitative account of the ob-servable data, are normally to becomplemented by correspondence rules.These allow for the operationalinterpretation of formal notationsand theoretical constructs in termsof empirical methods of counting andmeasuring observable data.
Linguistictheory has not been interested toomuch in developing correspondencerules of that kind so far /15/.Following the line of LABOV /9/and LEECH /10/, prevail ing linguis-tic theory and linguistic semanticsin particular is dominated by whathas been called the " categorialview " According to it, l inguisticentities are at least implicit lyasserted to be discrete, invariant,qual itat ively distinct, conjunctivelydefinable, and composed of atomicprimes.
Membership in categories,and relations of inclusion and ex-clusion among units and categories,are established by a deterministictype of rule that allows only forbinary ( positive or negative ) ortriple ( positive, negative, or op-tional ) assignment, but has no meansto represent probable and/or possibledegrees of transition.
This type ofrule - particularly when employedfor meaning representation purposes- has come under severe crit icismfrom as seemingly disparate dis-ciplines like cognitive theory( e.g.
/ 12 / ) and experimentalpsychology ( e.g.
/20/ ) , informationand computer science ( e.g.
/23/, /4/),psycholinguistics ( e.g.
/16/, /11/) ,sociol inguistics ( e.g.
/8/, /7/,computational semantics ( e.g.
/14/),and artif icial intell igence ( e.g.1221, 151) .From the increasing amount of strongempirical evidence piling, up in favourof some re-adjustment, a (meta-theore-tical) modif ication appears to beoverdue.
Accordingly, it may be arguedthat - contrary to the experimental lyand simulatively well established(object-theoretical) fuzziness ofcognitive categorizing and its l inguis-tic correspondences - any formal re,presentation of it using only binarysystems' notations wil l  inevitably re-sult in inadequately sharp-edgedlattices.
When imposed upon the varyingand vague structures constituted andmodif ied continuously during the processof verbal communication observed to bemodelled, this will render formal re-presentations of discrete entities withclear-cut boundaries where blurredmargins and continuous transitionswould be adequate.The modif ications suggested so farmay be summarized to concern both, theobservable manifestat ion and/or formalrepresentation of discourse, allowinggradual rather than abrupt transitionsto account for imprecise phenomena ina precise way.
This can be achieved, asI see it, formally by means of fuzzy settheoretical notations /24/, and opera-tionally by means of empirical proce-dures assigned to them /19/.
Applied tonatural language data, they wil l  inter-relate observable but essential ly fuzzylanguage phenomena on the one hand, andformal but finally categorial notationsof their l inguistic descriptions onthe other.Thus, findings and/or hypotheses oneither side may become testable againsteach other, allowing for mutual modif i -cations in the course of gradual im-provement and increasing adequacy ofthe model and what it represents.3.
Structure of MeaningWhat makes the analysis of naturallanguage meaning so intricate a problemdepends on the particular nature ofwhat has to be represented as its re-sults, namely, a representationalstructure in its own.
It is this re-presentational aspect of languagewhich theories of semantics and cogni-tion have been, and still are focussedon in particular.According to the more traditionaltheories, natural language meaning canbe characterized by its denotative andconnotative aspects.
Denotation isunderstood to constitute referentialmeaning as a system of relationsbetween words or sentences of a--77language and the objects  or processesthey refer  to.
Connotat ion  is def inedto const i tute  structura l  meanings  as asystem by which words or sentences of alanguage are conceptua l ly  re&ated toone another.
Referent ia l  semantic the-ory is t ruth- funct iona l  and formal lye laborated but as such not prepared toaccount  sat i s factor i ly  for the vague-ness of natura l  language meaning;whereas  structura l  semant ics  has con-s idered vagueness  somewhat  fundamentalof language but,  being based main lyupon intui t ive int rospect ion,  it hasnot achieved the theoret ica l  or me-thodologica l  cons is tency of formaltheor ies.In the course of recent,  more pro-cedura l  approaches to cogni t ion andlanguage comprehens ion ,  the former d is-t inct ion of referent ia l  and structura lmeaning was embedded in what  became tobe known as frame semant ics  /17/.
Thecentra l  not ion of it is that of memorywhich serve as a paradigm for the op-erat ional  aspects  of both, wor ld sys-tem structures and language systemstructures.
The basic d i s t inc t ion  ofwhat  may propos i t iona l ly  be formulatedas opposed to what  may only prototyp i -ca l ly  be real ized in some system struc-ture of stored exper iences,  is re f lec-ted in the great  var ie ty  of not ionalpair ings which d i f fe rent  d isc ip l ineshave produced facing a s imi lar ,  if notident ical  research problem.
Thus, theirnot ions of formal vs. exper ient?a lknowledge /2/, semantic  vs. episodicmemory  /21/, frame vs. scene /3/,descr ip t ion  vs. schema /I/, etc.
showa str ik ing resemblance:  a l though theirapproaches d i f fer  in what  they con-sider natural  language meaning to be,they nontheless  converge on the centra lnot ion of it, being a re lat ion betweena representat ion  (i.e.
the body ofdiscourse) and that which it repre-sents (i.e.
a re ferent ia l l y  and/orprototyp ica l ly  def ined system struc-ture).4.
A formal approachIt is this throughout  re lat iona lstructure of meaning that obv ious lya l lowed the concept of fuzzy sets andre lat ions to be employed to incorporatevagueness  into formal  theories of se-mant ics .The most  recent,  and at that mostcomprehens ive  approach (at least Iknow of) to tackle the problem of na-tural language meaning,  is that of L.A.Zadeh /24/.
Under the acronym PRUF for'Possibi l ist ic ,  Re lat ional ,  Universal ,Fuzzy' he has devised a meaning repre-sentat ion language for natural  languageswhich is poss ib i l i s t i c  instead of truth-funct ional ,  and whose d ic t ionary  providesl ingu is t ica l ly  label led fuzzy subsets ofthe universe,  instead of sets of seman-tic markers  under word-headings .The basic idea, upon which thisapproach hinges, is that a re ferent ia lmeaning may be exp l i cated  as a fuzzycor respondence between language termsand a universe of d iscourse.
This corres-pondence, L, is formal ly  def ined to be afuzzy b inary re lat ion from a set oflanguage terms, T, to a universe of d is -course,  U.
As a fuzzy relat ion,  L ischaracter i zed  by a membersh ip - funct ion~L  : T x U -~ ~, I \ ]  ; x ~ T, z ~ U;O :~L(X ,Z)  ~ I (I)which assoc iates  with each ordered pair(x,z) its grade of membersh ip  ~L(X ,Z)  ,being a numer ic  value between u ano I ,in L, so thatL ,: {((x,z), CL(x,z))} <2)The fuzzy re lat ion L now induces a bi lat-eral  cor respondence accord ing to whicha) the re ferenc ia l  meg ning of an e lementx' i~ T may be expl icated as thefuzzy subset  M(x') in U, ass igned toit by the membersh ip  funct ion ~Lcondi t ioned on x',M(x'):=,~L(Z,X'):= <((x',z 1),~n(x,zl)),.... ((X',Zn) , ~L(X ' ,Zn) )  > (3)b) the l inguist ic  descr ip t ion  of ane lement z' in U may be g iven as afuzzy subset D(z') in T ass igned toit by the membersh ip  funct ion ~Lcondi t ioned on z'D(z'):=~(x,z'):: <((Xl,Z'),~L(Xl,Z'),?
..,((Xn,Z') , ~L(Xn ,Z ' ) )> (4)The def in i t ions  g iven in fuzzy setstheory for equal i ty ,  conta inment,  com-plement,  in tersect ion , and union a l lowfor an app l i cat ion  both,  to re ferent ia lmeanings  M(x) as subsets of e lements inU and to l inguist ic  descr ip t ions  D(z)as subsets of uni ts  in T. This corres-ponds to the d is t inc t ion  between scenic,or conceptua l  re lat ions  on the one hand,and f rame,  or semantic  re lat ions on theother - the latter of which only wi l l  beintroduced here.Thus, synonymy of two terms x ,x '~  Tmay be given as the equal i ty  of the twofuzzy subsets M(x) and M(x') repre-78senting the re ferent ia l  meaning in UX : X' iff ~L(Z ,X)= ~L(Z,X' )for all z (5)Part ia l  synonymy may be def ined by as imi lar i ty  formula introducing somethresho ld -va lue  sx~ x' i f f l~L(Z,X) - ~L(Z,X')  & sfor all z (6)Hyponymy of a term x re lat ive to x' maybe expl icated as conta inment  of themeaning represent ing fuzzy sets con-cernedx~x'  iff~L(z,x) ~(z,x')for all z (7)In so far as the operat ions of comple-ment,  in tersect ion and un ion are con-cerned which cor respond to negat ion,con junct ion  and ad junct ion  respect ive-ly, there has been some cr i t i ca l  d is -cuss ion lately, par t i cu lar ly  on thegrounds of exper imenta l  results.
Thesesuggest  that d i f fe rent  def in i t ions  ofoperat ions  should be mainta ined  accord-ing to and comparable  with the scene-f rame-d is t inc t ion  aluded to above.
Forthe generat ion  of new mean ings  whichdenote poss ib le  but  not  yet labelede lements  (or sets of elements) in U, itcan wel l  be argued that the fo l lowingdef in i t ions  should operate on both,re ferent ia l  meanings  M(x) and l inguis-tic descr ip t ions  D(z) the former ofwhich only are given here.Negat ion  (complement) :~x: = M(x) = I -~L(Z ,X)  for al l  z (8)Con junct io  ~ ( intersect ion):x ~,x':= M(x~x ' )=min im L(z,x) ,~(z ,x ' ) \ ]  for al l  z (9)Ad junct ion  (union) :x vx': = M(xox ' )=max\[~L(Z,X\]  ,~L(Z,X') \] for all z (10)A l though formal ly  sat is factory  - asout l ined and i l lust rated by PRUF - theapproach's  basic assumpt ion concern ingthe re ferent ia l  nature of natura l  mean-ing proves to be cruc ia l  for its empir -ical appl icab i l i ty :  in order to deter -mine the membersh ip -grades  of a fuzzyset, or fuzzy re lat ion  respect ive ly ,one has to have access to re levantempir ica l  data def ined to const i tutethe sets, and some operat iona l  means toca lculate the numer ica l  va lues  fromthese data.As the domain of the fuzzy re lat ion~ conta in not only the set of terms i Lof a language, T, but also the set ofobjects and/or  processes these terms arebe l ieved to denote in the universe,  U,both these sets should be access ib le  inorder to let an empir ica l  procedure bedevised that could be ass igned to ;~T.
"Al l  that Zadeh /24/ is of fer ing in Thatrespect,  stays empir ica l ly  rather  vague.He assumes that "each of the symbols ornames in T may be def ined ostens ive lyor by exempl i f i cat ion .
That is bypoint ing or otherwise focuss ing on areal  or abst ract  ob ject  in U and indi-cat ing the degree - on the scale from0 to I - to which it is compat ib le  withthe symbol  in quest ion".This cannot  be cons idered a so lut ionwhich may be cal led both adequate andoperat iona l  in the above sense.
Takento be executable ,  Zadeh's suggest ionnecessar i ly  involves probands' quest ion-ing about  what  they think or be l ieve aterm denotes.
Thus,  the procedure wouldagain have to rely on the indiv idual  in-t rospect ion of a mul t i tude  of competentspeakers,  instead of making thesespeakers employ the term's denotat iona land/or connotat iona l  funct ion in thecourse of communicat ive  verba l  inter-action.
However,  exper imenta l  psycho l -ogy has taught us to expect  cons iderated i f fe rences  between what people thinkthey would do under certa in  presupposedcondit ions,  and what  in fact  they wi l ldo when these condi t ions are real.
Andthere is every reason to assume thatthis d i f ference is found in cases oflanguage per formance,  too.So, it would  appear more appropr ia teto make natura l  language use the basisfor ident i fy ing those language regular -ities, which under certa in communica-tion frame condi t ions  real  speakers/hearers  fo l low and/or  establ ish in d is-course.
These wi l l  consequent ly  a l lownatural  language meaning (whatever thatmay be) not only to be intended andunderstood,  but a lso to be analysed andrepresented.
As this apparent ly  is theonly cer ta inty  about meaning anyway,namely that it can only be const i tutedby means of natura l  language texts,these should also be able to providethe necessary  data wi th  the advantageof being empi r ica l ly  access ib le .
As-sembled in a pragmat ica l ly  homogeneouscorpus, the usage regu lar i t ies  whichthe lexical  items produce,  may thus be79analysed s tat i s t i ca l ly  w i th  the numer-ical va lues obtained to def ine fuzzyvocabu lary  mappings  /16/.5.
An  empir ica l  reconst ruct !onFo l lowing  this l ine of argument  isto ask for a connotat iona l  supplementto the denotat iona l  approach Zadeh for-warded so far.
This goes along with  anecessary  re - in terpretat ion  of what  thesets T and U (I) in the re ferent ia lmeaning re lat ion poss ib ly  stand for.From a structura l  po int -o f -v iew,  T isnot just a set of terms of a languageany more,  but a system of lexical  unitsthe usage regular i t ies  of which inducea re la t iona l  s t ructure of its own.
So,this structure does not just a l low fora set of objects  and/or processes  in Uto be denoted,  but it const i tu tes  themas a system of concept -po ints ,  which isdependent  on, but not ident ica l  withthe one induced by the usage regu lar -it ies of terms as employed and ident i -f ied in natura l  language d iscourse  /17/.Thus, being a non-symmetr ic ,  fuzzy,b inary re lat ion,  ~ can empi r i ca l ly  bereconst ructed  only on the basis  ofnatura l  language d iscourse  data.
Sofar, s tat i s t ica l  procedures  have beenused for the reconst ruct ion  by a con-secut ive mapp ing  in three stages fromT to U, prov id ing the membersh ip -gradesf?ro~nLthe" f i rst  stage co -occur rences  ofterms are not just counted but the in-tens i t ies  of co -occur r ing  terms in thetexts of the database are ca lcu lated.This is done by a mod i f ied  cor re la t ion-coe f f i c ient  ~ that measures  mutua l  (po-sitive) a f f in i ty  or (negative) repug-nancy of pairs of terms x ,x '~T by realnumbers from the interval  \[-I, +I \ ] .can therefore be cons idered a fuzzy re-lat ion in the Car tes ian -product  of theset of terms T used in the texts ana-lysed: T x T ,~, ,  I : \ [ - I ,+ I \ ]  ;::  {xi  , i : I  .
