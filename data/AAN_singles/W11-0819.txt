We focus on lexi-cographic exploitation of such resources and presenta system, called FipsCoView,1 which is specificallyaimed at supporting the work of lexicographers whocompile multilingual collocation resources.Collocation, a rather ill-defined linguistic con-cept referring to a large and heterogeneous sub-classof multi-word expressions, is understood here as acombination of words that produces natural-soun-ding speech and writing (Lea and Runcie, 2002)and that has syntactic and semantic properties whichcannot be entirely predicted from those of its com-ponents and therefore has to be listed in a lexicon(Evert, 2004).
Collocations are particularly interest-ing from a translation point of view, and our systemcan also be used to facilitate the task of translatorslooking for the right translation of a word in context.The usage scenario is the following.
Given aword, like money, our system provides a concise andintuitive presentation of the list of collocations with1Available at http://tinyurl.com/FipsCoView.that word, which have previously been detected inthe source language version of the parallel corpus.By selecting one of the items in this list, e.g., moneylaundering, users will be able to see the contexts ofthat item, represented by the sentences in which itoccurs.
In addition, users can select a target lan-guage from the list of other languages in which themultilingual corpus is available2 and visualise thetarget language version of the source sentences.This presentation enables users to find potentialtranslation equivalents for collocations by inspectingthe target sentences.
Thus, in the case of French, thepreferred equivalent found is blanchiment d?argent,lit., ?money whitening?, rather than the literal trans-lation from English, *lavage d?argent.
In the case ofItalian, this is riciclaggio di denaro, lit., ?recyclingof money?, rather than the literal translation ?lavag-gio di soldi, also possible but much less preferred.Access to target sentences is important as it allowsusers to see how the translation of a collocation varydepending on the context.
Besides, it provides use-ful usage clues, indicating, inter alia, the allowed orpreferred morphosyntactic features of a collocation.In this paper, we present the architecture ofFipsCoView and outline its main functionalities.This system is an extension of FipsCo, a largerfully-fledged off-line system, which, in turn, is in-tegrated into a complex framework for process-ing multi-word expressions (Seretan, 2009).
Whilethe off-line system finds direct applicability in ouron-going projects of large-scale multilingual syntac-2Europarl includes 11 languages: French, Italian, Spanish,Portuguese, English, Dutch, German, Danish, Swedish, Greek,Finnish.
Note that our tool is not tailored to this specific corpus.125Figure 1: FipsCoView: System architecture.tic parsing (Wehrli, 2007) and syntax-based machinetranslation (Wehrli et al, 2009), the on-line versionis designed to offer access to the derived collocationresources to a broader community.2 Architecture and Main FunctionalitiesFigure 1 shows the architecture of FipsCoView.
Themain system modules are the collocation extractionmodule, the search & visualisation module, the con-cordancing and the sentence alignment modules.The processing flow is pipelined.
The key mod-ule of the system, collocation extraction, relies ona syntax-based methodology that combines lexi-cal statistics with syntactic information provided byFips, a deep symbolic parser (Wehrli, 2007).
Thismethodology is fully described and evaluated inSeretan (2011).
In principle, the extraction takesplace only once, but new corpora can be processedlater and results are cumulated.
The sentence align-ment (Nerima et al, 2003) is performed partially,i.e., only for the sentences actually displayed by theconcordancing module.
It is done on the fly, thuseliminating the need of pre-aligning the corpora.The role of the concordancing module is topresent the sentence contexts for a selected colloca-tion (cf.
scenario described in ?1).
The words in thiscollocation are highlighted for readability.
The listof sentences is displayed in the order given by thesyntactic variation of collocations, that is, the collo-cation instances for which the distance between thecomponents is larger are displayed first.
This func-tionality is designed to support the work of users in-specting the syntactic properties of collocations.The search & visualisation module takes as inputthe word entered by the user in the system interface,performs a search in the database that stores the col-location extraction results, and provides a one-pagepresentation of the collocational information relatedto the sought word.
Users can set visualisation pa-rameters such as the minimal frequency and associa-tion score, which limit the displayed results accord-ing to the number of occurrences in the corpus andthe ?association strength?
between the componentwords, as given by the lexical association measureused to extract collocations.
The measure we typi-cally use is log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993); seePecina (2008) for an inventory of measures.Depending on these parameters, the automaticallycreated collocation entry is more or less exhaustive(the output adapts to the specific user?s purpose).
Adifferent sub-entry is created for each part of speechof the sought word (for instance, report can eitherbe a noun or a verb).
Under each sub-entry, colloca-tions are organised by syntactic type, e.g., adjective-noun (comprehensive report), noun-noun (initiativereport), subject-verb (report highlights), verb-object(produce a report).
To avoid redundancy, only thecollocating words are shown.
The sought word isunderstood and is replaced by a tilde character, ina paper dictionary style.
Unlike in paper dictionarypresentations, the online presentation benefits fromthe HTML environment by using colours, adapt-ing the font size so that it reflects the associationstrength (the most important combinations are morevisually salient), displaying additional informationsuch as score and frequency, and using hyper-linksfor navigating from one word to another.With respect to similar systems (Barlow, 2002;Scott, 2004; Kilgarriff et al, 2004; Charest et al,2007; Rayson, 2009; Fletcher, 2011), our systemuniquely combines parallel concordancing with col-location detection based on deep syntactic process-ing.
It is available for English, French, Spanish andItalian and it is being extended to other languages.AcknowledgementThis work is partly supported by the Swiss NationalScience Foundation (grant no.
