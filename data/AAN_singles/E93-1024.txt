12D-7000 Stuttgart 1, FRGJuergen@ims.uni-stuttgart.deAbstractKaplan et al (1989) present a frameworkfor translation based on the descriptionand correspondence oncepts of Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan andBresnan, 1982).
Certain phenomena, inparticular the head-switching of adverbsand verbs, seem to be problematic for thatapproach.
In this paper we suggest hatthese difficulties are more properlyconsidered as the result of defectivemonolingual nalyses.
We propose a newdescription-language op rator, restriction,to permit a succinct formal encoding of theinformal intuition that semantic unitssometimes correspond to subsets offunctional information.
This operator, inconjunction with an additional recursionprovided by a description-by-analysis rule,is the basis of a more adequate account ofhead-switching that preserves theadvantages of correspondence-basedtranslation.1.
IntroductionKaplan et al (1989) present a framework fortranslation based on the description andcorrespondence oncepts of Lexical-FunctionalGrammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982).
LFGformulates the syntactic dependencies andgeneralizations of natural anguages in terms ofthe properties of formal structures of differenttypes: ordinary phrase-structure t es representthe surface constituency of sentences whilehierarchical finite functions represent theirunderlying grammatical relations.
Thestructures for a particular sentence are those thatsatisfy descriptions produced from annotatedphrase-structure rules and lexical entries.
Thedescription of the more abstract functionalstructure is determined by the dominance andprecedence relations of the superficialconstituent s ructure, given the assumption thatthere is a piecewise correspondence function thatmaps the nodes in the c-structure tree into theunits of the f-structure.
Kaplan (1987) andHalvorsen and Kaplan (1988) extend thisstructure/description/correspondence architec-ture to provide modular and declarativecharacterizations of the relationships betweensyntactic structures and other levels of linguisticrepresentation.
Kaplan et al (1989) suggest thatthis architecture can provide a formal basis forspecifying complex source-target translationrelationships in a declarative fashion that buildson monolingual grammars and lexicons that areindependently motivated and theoreticallyjustified.
In particular, the approach permitsfeatures from different linguistic levels to affecttranslation without requiring that reflexes ofthose disparate features appear together in anotherwise unmotivated transfer or interlingualrepresentation.Kaplan et al (1989) offer several examplesto illustrate the effectiveness of this approach totranslation.
These examples involve changes ingrammatical functions from source to target,differences in control, and differences inembedding (or head-switching).
The Kaplan etal.
solutions depend on monolingualrepresentations of phrasal, functional, andsemantic information related by thecorrespondences ~p and a, with translation193correspondences ?

f_structur eo ~_..__.._..-------~ odi) 0 / ~ ~:  c-structureThese solutions utilize the formal device ofcodescription to specify the target structureconstraints in terms of simple compositions oftheand z' mappings with the monolingual sourcecorrespondences.
For instance, the fact that theobject of the German beantworten corresponds tothe AOBJ of the French r~pondre is indicated byassociating the following transfer equations withthe normal monolingual lexical entry forbeantworten:(2) (~ ~ PRED FN) = rdpondre(1; T SUBJ)= 1;( ~ SUB J)(~ ~ AOBJ)= ~( ~' OBJ)The last line asserts that the AOBJ in the targetf-structure is the translation of the source OBJ.The metavariable ~ in LFG is an abbreviationfor (1)(M(*)) and thus denotes the f-structure thatcorresponds to the mother of the beantwortenlexical node in the German c-structure (indicatedby *).
The expression ?
~ can then be seen as~(~(M(*))) = ~ o ~b(M(*)) and thus as incorporatingthe composition ~odp.
Significantly, the M(*)term is also present, which means that the targetconstraints are determined in the same recursiveanalysis of the source c-structure that is used toderive the source f-structure description.
Thecodescription device crucially involves both acomposition of correspondences and a singlerecursive analysis of common ancestorstructures.
This contrasts with description-by-analysis, another technique mentioned byKaplan and Halvorsen (1988) and Kaplan et aL(1989) for deriving descriptions of abstractstructures.2.
Difficulties with thecorrespondence approachThis proposal for correspondence-basedtranslation has been scrutinized by a number ofresearchers (e.g.
Sadler et al, 1989, Sadler et al,1990, Sadler and Thompson, 1991), and severaldifficulties have been pointed out.
Thesedifficulties arise particularly in cases where theindependently motivated source and targetstructures are not very closely aligned, wheresingle units in a source structure map to multipleunits in the target (so-called splitting) or wherehierarchical relationships are interchanged inmapping from source to target (switching).
Ifsuch discrepancies are both locally bounded andpredictable, then they can in principle be handledby means of codescription statements involvingthe ordinary monolingual description-languageconstructs of function-application a d equality.But even if possible, such conservativetreatments may not permit obviousgeneralizations about he translation relation tobe naturally expressed.
Sadler et al (1990)demonstrate this point by examples in which thetranslation of a lexical head differs according toits dependents in the source sentence (Englishcommit suicide translates to French (se) suiciderwhereas commit a crime translates to commettreune crime).
They suggest refining the basiccorrespondence approach by separating suchidiosyncratic source-target interactions into aseparate transfer lexicon whose stipulations willoverride (perhaps via the priority union operator)the generic transfer specifications that mightstill be associated with the source-languagepredicates.Sadler et al (1989) and Sadler andThompson (1991) focus on another case ofstructural misalignment in translation, asillustrated in (3):(3) (a) The baby just fell.
(b) Le b~b~ vient de tomber.The syntactic head of the English sentence (fell)corresponds to the head of the French embeddedcomplement (tomber), while the English adjunctjust  corresponds tothe head of the French matrix.Other well-known contrasts show syntacticembeddings in English corresponding tosentential djuncts in Dutch (and German):194(4) (a) John likes to swim.
(b) Janzwemt graag.Kaplan et al (1989) discussed such differences inembedding and offered two alternative analysesthat rely only on codescriptive specifications.
Onone account, head-switching is accomplished bymapping the source S node to an f-structure thatcontains information about the central clausalrelations but excludes adjunct information.
TheADV node maps to an f-structure that has theadverb as its main predicate with the centralclausal f-structure appearing in argumentposition.
The 'just' f-structure, though notaccessible from the S node, maps through t to theoutermost target f-structure.
This complexinterchange is specified in the lexical entry andrule in (5) and is diagrammed in Figure 1(ignoring such details as person, number, case,and tense).
(5) (a) just  ADV (1` PRED)='just<(I' ARG)>'(1; 1' PRED FN)=venir(~ 1`  XCOMP)-----~( 1'ARG)(b) S -~ NP (ADV) VP( 1`  SUB J) = ~ 1`  =( ~ ARG)In the second proposal a completely integratedsource f-structure maps to a single integratedtarget structure.
As specified by the rule (6), theadverb is assigned an adjunct grammaticalfunction in the source and its translation includesthe translation of the enclosing source f-structureas its XCOMP, as shown in Figure 2.
(6) S --~ NP ADV VP( 1' SUB J) = ~ (1' ADJ) =1' = (~ ~ XCOMP)Sadler et aI.
(1989) and Sadler andThompson (1991) point out a significantinadequacy of both these arrangements.
Eventhough the proper target embeddings are derivedunder both correspondence configurations, inneither case does the translation of thef-structure of the source S node include thetranslation of the adverb.
This shows up as aproblem when such examples are embedded ascomplements in larger sentences:(7) (a) I think that the baby just fell.
(b) Je pense que le bdbd vient de tomber.To maintain modularity, the codescriptive lexicalentry for think must provide a direct mapping tothe French penser that is not sensitive to theinternal structure of the complement, along thelines of(8):think V(1' PRED)='think<(T SUBJ)(T COMP)>'(1; T PRED FN)=penser('1; 1' COMP)=l;( 1' COMP)But then the translation f-structure constraintswill characterize the pair of structures (9); theseshare the common tomber substructure but areotherwise unrelated.

Head-switching with integrated f-structureThe z constraints thus leave unspecified therelative scopes of the penser  and venir  predicates.As Sadler et al (1989) observe, the problem iseven worse when several adverbs appeartogether: there is no obvious way to modifyeither of the rules (hb) or (6) to account for thescope interactions among the adverbs, let alnetheir relations to higher predicates.Sadler et al (1989) and Sadler andThompson (1991) consider several ways in whichthe translation constraints might be modified tocircumvent these difficulties yet remain faithfulto the spirit of the correspondence-basedapproach.
While each of their proposals iscarefully worked out, they conclude (and weagree) that none of them is completelysatisfactory or particularly compelling.
Thereason, we believe, is that the head-switchingwith adverbial modifiers that shows up as aproblem in correspondence-based translation isactually a symptom of a more fundamental errorin the syntactic and semantic analysis of thesource language.
In sentences with adverbialmodifiers, the syntactic head (which controlssubcategorization and enters into agreementrelations) is not the same as the semantic head(the predicate with widest scope).
Moreover,normal linguistic arguments would assign a flatf-structure to sentences with several adverbswhile meaning relations would be represented ina hierarchical semantic structure.
Thus on thisview, if translation codescriptions map from theproper hierarchical semantic structures via ~'instead of from flat f-structures via ~, adverbialhead-switching disappears as a special problemfor correspondence-based translation.Sadler and Thompson (1991, footnote I)mention the arrangement we are proposing, andobserve that the translation codescriptionproblems may then merely be displaced toequivalent difficulties in characterizing themonolingual o instead of z: the problems may bemoved around and renamed, but not solved.
Thismay be so, but any conceptual clarification insuch a murky domain must be regarded as anadvance, if only because it helps to spotlight heissues that are relevant to a solution and toconnect them to other related phenomena.Indeed, we now suggest that adverbialhead-switching is a special case of the generalproblem of mapping flat syntactic structures tohierarchical semantic ones.
So-called "lightverbs", complex-predicates, and clause-unionphenomena in many languages are similarlydifficult to handle in LFG using onlycodescription, attribute-value function-application, and equality constraints (or usingthe analogous formal devices of other theories,such as attribute-value unification over signs orcategories).
In the next section of this paper, weextend LFG's f-structure description language byintroducing a new formal operator, calledrestriction.
We illustrate its properties byapplying it to a simple light-predicate sentence inUrdu.
In Section 4 we combine restriction withdescription-by-analysis to characterize theappropriate hierarchical semantic structures forEnglish sentential adverbs.
At the end, wereturn to the head-switching problem ofcorrespondence-based translation, providing asimple solution in terms of the ~' correspondence.3.
The restriction operator andstructural misalignmentsA simple kind of syntax/semantics misalignmentis exemplified by constructions involvinglight-verbs or complex predicates.
These are196constructions formed by two or more verbsinvolving two or more semantic relations, butwith the notable peculiarity that the complexbehaves as a single, monoclausal syntactic unitaccording to standard tests of subcategorizationand agreement.
Butt et al (1990) have arguedpersuasively that Urdu complex predicates aresyntactically monoclausal nd further, that thecomplex predicate cannot be formed in thelexicon.
The details of the argument do notmatter for present purposes, and we will simplyaccept their analysis of sentence (10a) whoseEnglish translation is given in (10b).
The c-, f-,and semantic-structures, according to theiranalysis, are shown in Figure 3.
(I0) (a) Anjum-ne diyaa Saddaf-koxat likhne.
(b) An jum let Saddafwrite a letter.The crucial feature of this analysis is that there isa single set of governed grammatical functions inthe f-structure, and these are derivedsystematically from the normalsubcategorization of the main predicate likhne'write'.
The governable functions of diyaa when itstands as an independent predicate (usuallyglossed as the ditransitive predicate 'give') arenot represented in the f-structure.
The secondobvious feature is that the flat f-structure mapsto the hierarchical semantic structure, where theouter predicate has the permissive readingconveyed by diyaa in its light-verb sense and theinner proposition contains the main predicateand its arguments.
This analysis cannot beformulated using standard codescription,function-application, a d equality because thereis no separate level in the f-structure that theinner semantic proposition can correspond toandthus no way to describe its properties.While there may be a technical problem infinding a structure that the inner proposition cancorrespond to, there is a very clear intuitionabout what parts of the f-structure carry theinformation that constrains that piece of thesemantic structure, namely, the sub-f-structureobtained by eliminating the SUBJ attribute andvalue.
The following diagram depicts thisintuition:(11)I REO x-write<S,O,02>l---  ?

If f isthe f-structure in (13a), then the f-structure in(13b) is f~SUBJ:~RED kicq(13) (a) f=  ISUB J John ILOBJ balll(b) f\SUBJ ---- ~RED kick" lLOBJ bal IIRestriction is a designator analogous to ordinaryfunction-application in that it provides a way  ofreferring to elements of f-structure space byvirtue of their relations to other f-structures.
If fand g are two f-structure designators and adenotes an attribute, then(14) (f a) = (g a)asserts that f and g both have anattribute a with exactly the samevalue; they may or may not have otherattributes and values in common.f l a=g laasserts that f and g have all attributesand values in common other than a;they may or may not have values for aand those values may or may not beidentical.Thus, restriction and function-application can beused to impose complementary constraints onf-structure values.
We note that restriction isassociative and commutative in its second(attribute) argument, so that \[f\a\] \b = \[f\b\] \a =f\(ab}, and that for any f-structure f andattribute a it is always the case that f \asubsumes f (f\a V- f).Returning now to the Urdu example, we seethat if the top-level f-structure (the onecorresponding to the S node) is denoted by f, thesubsidiary f-structure to which corresponds theinner proposition in (11) is the restriction off bySUBJ and can be referred to by the expressionf\SUBJ.
The restriction operator can be used incodescription statements so that exactly theconfiguration in (11) is assigned to the Urdusentence.
A lexical redundancy rule can beintroduced to systematically modify the lexicalentries for normal verbs like likhne to make themsuitable for combination with a light-verb:(15) ( ~ SUBJ) --* ( T OBJ2)o 1' --* o\[ 1' \SUBJ\]This rule replaces all references to thegrammatical function SUBJ with OBJ2, thusavoiding conflict with the SUBJ introduced by thelight verb, and it replaces all occurrences of theterm o 1' with the term o\[ 1' kSUBJ\].
This indicatesthat the main predicate provides constraints onthe semantic structure corresponding to thesubject-free f-structure.
As a result of this rule,the usual equations for likhne in (16a) would giverise to the alternatives in (16b):(16) (a) (o 1' ARG1) ---- o( ~ SUBJ)(o1' ARG2) ---- o( ~ OBJ)(b) (o\[ 1'~SUBJ\] ARG1)=o( ~ OBJ2)(o\[ 1' ~SUBJ\] ARG2)---- o( T OBJ)The lexical rule would also make other minoradjustments to fill out the entry; the details donot concern us here.4.
Restriction and adverbialmodifiersSentence with adverbial modifiers can also becharacterized intuitively as having a fiatsyntactic structure with hierarchical semanticrelations, and restriction can also be used todescribe the appropriate structuralconfigurations.
The adverbial examples aboveinvolve only single sentential adjuncts, but ouranalysis allows for any number of adverbs withall possible scope ambiguities, and it can easilybe extended to handle VP modifiers as well.
Westart with a c-structure rule that assignsarbitrarily many adverbs to the set-value of theADJ attribute, consistent with the original LFGaccount of adjuncts (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982):(17) S --~ NP ADV* VP( I' SUB J)-- ~ ~ e (1' ADJ)The sentence (18a) will be assigned thef-structure (18b) by virtue of this rule.
Our goalis to associate with this f-structure the198alternative semantic structures in (19).
(18) (a) John obviously just fell.
(b) pRED' fall<\[John\]>' \]JSUBJ ~RED 'John'\] }LADJ { \[obviously\] \[just\](19) Ca)I EL obviously In\]l 1 RGI FREL just ~RGI ~EL fall LARGI Joh(b) IEL justRGI F REL ?bvi?uslyTlLARGI JohnlJJIntuitively, the innermost proposition in both(19a) and (19b) is based on the f-structureinformation in (18b) ignoring the adjuncts; themiddle proposition in (19a) is exactly what wewould expect for a sentence that included just butnot obviously, and the middle proposition in (19b)would be appropriate for a sentence containingonly obviously.
Thus the semantic structuresagain seem to correspond to subsets of f-structureinformation, and we begin by completing thedefinition of the restriction operator.
In additionto restricting an f-structure by an attribute, asdefined in (12), we also define the restriction of anf-structure by an element of an attribute'sset-value:(20) If f is an f-structure and a is an attribute:f \<ag> =.f f \  a if (fa)-{g} =t f \  a U {'<a, (f a)-{g} > } otherwiseThe restriction of a given f-structure f by aparticular member  of an attribute a's set-value isthe f-structure that results from deleting thatmember  of the set and also deleting the attributeitself if the set would then be empty.
Therelationships in (21) exemplify the pattern:p RED 'fall<\[John\]>\] (21) f= ~UBJ ~RED 'John\]~DJ { \[just\] }g = \[just\]= pR O 'f ll<\[Joh.\]>qf \<ADJ g>  UBJ  RED 'John\] \]We note that set-element restriction also hascommutative and associative properties:(22) \ [ f~<ag>\]\<ah> =\[/~.<ah>\]\<ag>=t \<agh>The restriction operator can now be used todescribe the semantic correspondences foradverbial sentences.
If f designates thef-structure in (18b) and j and o designate thef-structures corresponding to the adverbs just andobviously, then the constraints (23a,b) describethe outermost REL and ARG1 configuration in(19a) and (23c,d) describe the next level ofsemantic embedding:(23) (a) (OfREL)=(oo REL)(b) (of ARGI)----o\[f\<CADJ o>\](c) (o~\<ADJo>\]  REL)----(oj REL)(d) (o~\<CADJ o>\] ARG1)=o\[f\< ADJ o j> \]= O~ADJ\]The innermost proposition can be described byinterpreting (or redundantly rewriting) a T in thecedescription equations in the fall lexical entry aso\[ ~ ~kDJ\], that is, by interpreting the aspecifications for all basic predicates ascharacterizing the semantics of an unmodifiedf-structure.The restriction constraints in (23) aresufficient to map f-structure subsumptionrelations into the desired hierarchical semanticstructures, but the number of such constraintsdepends on the size of the initial adjunct set;indeed, (23d) suggests that the size of individualconstraints used in this construction also growsin proportion to the number of modifiers.Constraints of this general form cannot beproduced by the normal recursive analysis of thec-structure because the c-structure itself, bylinguistic argumentation, does not have thedegree of embedding that these constraints wouldrequire.
The restriction operator can encode theintuitively desirable constraints, but anadditional recursive process is needed to generatethose constraints.
This recursion can arise froman explicit traversal of the f-structure in the styleof Halvorsen's (1983) semantic interpretationprocedure.
It can also come from lexicalexpressions of inside-out functional uncertainty;this formal device was introduced by Kaplan(1988) and has been applied to problems ofquantifier scope (Halvorsen and Kaplan, 1988)and anaphoric dependencies (Dalrymple, 1993).Here we explore only the description-by-analysis199approach, using the following analysis rule togenerate codescriptive assertions:(24) For fan f-structure, g ( (f ADJ), and g asentence adverb,of = og and(of ARG1) = o\[fk<ADJ g>\]According to this rule, a single element is chosen(nondeterministically) from an adjunct set tocontribute the relation for the semantic structureof the enclosing f-structure, and the semanticstructure corresponding to the f-structurewithout the chosen element becomes thatrelation's argument.
One application of the rulegivesrise to additional structures to which therule might also apply, and this recursiongenerates the appropriate set of constraints.
Forexample, suppose fis the f-structure in (18b) andthe obviously f-structure o is chosen as theinstantiation of g in the rule.
This produces theequations (23a,b) which define the configurationshown in (25).
The rule then matches againagainst the lower f-structure, thereby completingthe picture (26).(25)I!

We note withoutdiscussion that the rule in (24) is appropriate forsentence adverbs, which take completepropositions as arguments, but a differentsemantic structure is required for adverbs thatonly modify the meaning of the basic relation,such as the manner adverb in (27a).
Therelational embedding in (27b) gives a betteraccount of the meaning of this sentence.

Head-switching and translationThe restriction operator and thedescription-by-analysis rule (24) provide anaccount of adverbial modification that ismotivated purely on the basis of monolinguallinguistic argumentation.
The net effect,however, is to provide a natural hierarchicalstructure to serve as a source of codescriptiveconstraints in correspondence-based translation.The adjunct translation constraints for asentence such as(29) I think that the baby just fell.can now be associated quite directly with theadverbial lexical entries using the dcorrespondence between source and targetsemantic structures.
For example, the lexicalentry for just would include the simple equationsin (30):(30) (o T REL) =just(?
'O ~ REL) = venir200These involve the codescriptive composition of z'and o together with the ~b and M that are implicitin ~.
Along with all the other constraints fromthe lexicon, grammar, and description-by-analysis rules, these define the translationconfiguration outlined in Figure 4.
Therestriction f-structure that the fa \ ] \ ]  semanticsubstructure corresponds to is not shown in thefigure, but as we have seen, it is crucial to thedeclarative, order-free construction of theembedded head-switching translation.
Thisarrangement shifts the translation burden foradverbial modifiers from the f-structure to thesemantic structure and from the z correspondenceto z'.
However, despite its somewhat diminishedrole with respect to modifiers, thecorrespondence is still important in controllingthe translation of simpler grammatical functionassignments and other more superficialgrammatical properties.6.
Conc lus ionWe have suggested in this paper that certainproblems of correspondence-based translation, inparticular the difficulty of adverb and verbinterchanges, are more properly considered theresult of defective monolingual analyses.
Wehave proposed a new description-languageoperator, restriction, to permit a succinct formalencoding of the informal intuition that semanticunits sometimes correspond to subsets offunctional information.
This operator, inconjunction with an additional recursionprovided by a description-by-analysis rule, is thebasis of a more adequate account ofhead-switching phenomena.References\[Butt et al, 1990\] Miriam Butt, Michio Isoda, andPeter Sells.
