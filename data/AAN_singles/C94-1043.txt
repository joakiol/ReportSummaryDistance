ukAbst ractWe describe an approach to semiautomatic lex-icon development from |nachine readal)le dictio-naries with specific reference to verbal diatlleses,envisaging ways in which tile results obtained canbe used to guide word classification in the con-strnction of dictionary datal)ases.1 I n t roduct ionThe acquisition and representation of lexical knowl-edge from machine-readable dictionaries and text cor-pora have increasingly become major concerns in Com-putational Lexicography/Lexicology.
While this trendwas essentially set by the need to mmximize cost-effectiveness in building large scale Lexical KnowledgeBases for NLP (LKBs), there is a clear sense in whichthe construction of such knowledge I)ascs also caters tothe demand for better dictionaries.
Currently availabledictionaries and thesauri provide an undoubtedly richsource of lexical information, but often omit or neglectto make explicit salient syntactic and semantic proper-ties of word entries.
For exa|nplc, it is well known thatthe same verb sense can appear in a wtriety of snl)cat-egorization frames which can be related to one at|otherthrough valency alternations (diatheses).
Some dictio-naries provide subcategorization information by meansof grammar codes, as shown below for the "sail" sense.of the verb dock in LI)OCE - -  Longman's Dictionaryof Contemporary English (Procter, 1978).

Consequently, if we were to use thegrammar code information found in M)OCE to cre-ate verb entries in an I,I(B by automatic onversionwe would construct four seemingly vnrelated entriesfor the verb dock (see ?3).

For example, the choice of LKB types usedin the characterization f the verb swim above was in-duced from the syntactic and semantic codes foundin LDOCE and tim Longman Lexicon of Contempo-rary English (LLOCE, McArtllur 1980).
In LI)OCE,the first sense of the verb swim is marked ,'us astrict intransitive verb (\[I0\]) whose subject is animate((box .

l3 Verba l  D ia theses  and  Lex iea lAcqu is i t ionIn the example discussed above, MI~D-to-LKB conver-sion is relatively straightforward: a single LKB entry iscreated for swim since a single grammar code is foundin the MRD sources used.
Where a verb-sense ntrygives more than one grammar code, however, the ques-tion arises whether or not each grammar code shouldbe mapped into a distinct LKB entry.
For example,the codes given in LDOCE for the verb dock (see (1))could potentially be used to derive four LKB verb en-tries:(s) LKB TYPF, EXAMP LI,;a. s t r ie t - t rans-s ign Kim docked the boatb.
ob l - t rans-s lgn Kim docked the boatat Southamptonc.
s t r ie t - in t rans-s ign The boat dockedd.
obl- intrmxs-sign The boat docked atSouthamptonNotice, however, that in tllis case the creation of fourdistinct LKB entries is unnecessary insofar ,as the use ofthe verb exemplified in (5b) contains enongh informa-tion to derive the remaining uses of the verb throughlexical rules which progressively reduce the verb's va-lency by dropping the subject and/or prepositional ar-gument(s).
Such a step would be linguistically moti-vated in that it establishes a clear link between alter-native uses of the same verb sense.
Moreover, compactrepresentation of verb use extensions i  desirable froman engineering perspective its it reduces the size of ttmlexicon, allowing verb use expansion to be delayed tillparsing time.
This practice can be made to facilitatethe resolution of lexical ambiguity by enforcing selec-tive application of lexical rules (Copestake & Briscoe,1994).Compact representation of verb use extensions dueto valency alternations requires that a note of all ap-plicable lexical rules be made in each kernel entry.
Inchoosing ol) l - trans-slgn as the LKB type for dock,for example, specifications would be added saying thatthe verb is amenabh~" to the causative-inchoative al-ternation relating agentive and agentless uses ((5a,b)vs. (5c,d)), and the path alternation pertaining tothe omission of the prepositional argument ((5a,c) vs.(5b,d)).
In addition, the path alternation would ha~(eto be specified as to whether it preserves amenabilityto a telic interpretation (accomplishment or achieve-men|) of the event described by the verb or not.
Forexample, tile omission of the goal argnment for a verbsuch as drive, push or carmj induces an atelic (process)interpretation as indicated by incompatibility with aterminative adverbial:(6) a. ,\]ohn drove his car to London in one hourb.
John drove his ear (*in one hour)Within a (partial) deeomposltional pproach to verbsemantics (Tahny, 1985; Jackendolr, 1990; Sanfilippo,1993; Sanlilil)po el al., 1992)), this contrast can beexplained with reference to the rneaniug componentpath.
In (6a), the goal argument (1o London) fixes afinal bound for the path along which the driving eventtakes place.
Assuming that, the compositional meaningof tile sentence involves establishing a homomorphismbetween tile event described by the verb and the pathalong which such an event takes place (l)owty, 1991;Sanlilippo, 1991), it follows that with an unboundedpath (e.g.
(6b)) only a process interpretation is pos-sible, whereas with a bounded path (e.g.
(6a)) a relicinterpretation is more likely.
P,y contr~t, the omissionof the goal argument with verbs such ,an deliver, bring,dock and send does not inhibit amenability to a relicinterpretation, e.g.
(7) We can deliver the goods (to your door) in onehour274Our aim, then, wtLs to capture regularities across dis-tinct nses of the same verb sense by relating the sub-categorization frames relative to these uses via regularsyntactic and semantic hanges. '
lb iLssess the feasibil-ity of this approach, we attgmented the MtH)-to-LKBconversion code with facilities which make it possibleto infer amenability to specific diathesis alternationsfrom occurrence of multiple grammar codes and their~ssociated semantic odes in the MR, Ds.
To improve onthe informational content of LDOCE grammar codes,we used an intermediate dictionary semiantonmticallyderived from LDOCE (LI)OCEAnter) where the sub-categorization information inferrablc from grammarcodes and other orthographic onventions wi~s mademore explicit (Boguraev & Briscoe, 1989; Carroll& Grovel  1989).
Semantic inlbrmation about verbclasses was obtained by mapping across LI)OCF, andII, LOCE so as to augment LI)OCE queries with the-saurus information, i.e.
semantic odes (Santilippo &Poznafiski, 1992).Syntactic and semantic intbrmation relative to verbsenses was extracted through special functio,~s whichoperate on pointers to dictionary entries.
The ex-tracted info was used to generate FS representationsof  word  senses .
The collversion process was carriedout in such a way that whenever multiple subcatego-rization frames were found in association with a verbsense, only those which could not be derived via diathe-sis alternation were expanded into LKII entries, l;brexample, the LDOCEAnter entry for dock gives foursubeategorization frames:(dock)(((Cat V) (Takes NP) (Type 1))((Cat 7) (Takes NP PP) (Type 2) (PFtlRH at))(((;at 7) (Takes NP NP) (Type 2 Transi t ive))((Cat 7) (Takes NP NP PP) (Type 3) (PF\[\]RH at) ) )In this case, the four uses of the verb can allbe derived from the last one through application ofthe causative-inchoative and bounded-path alterna-tions mentioned above; all that ,ceds doing is to markwhat diatheses are possible in the LKB entry derived,e .g .o|)i-t ig,t ....... \]OIUI'II = do<zk= \[ TI(.ANS-ALT = catm- lnch  \]L L OIJIrAI/ I '  ~ I)-IHLth J'l?he algorithm which guides this process checkswhether information regardiug diathesis alternationscan be inferred from dictionary entries iu the MRI)sources or must be manually supplied.
In perform-lug this check, snbcategorization ptions relative to agiven verb sense which can be inferred from a moreinformative subcategorization frame are ignored.

It is nowwidely recognized that corpora are indispensable inthe acquisition of lexicaI information relating to is-sues of usage such as the range and frequency of dif-ferent patterns of syntactic realization.
'FILe availabil-ity of software tools for partial analysis of texts {e.g.morphological nd semantic tagging, phrasal parsingetc.)
has increased significantly the utility of corporain lexical acquisition by providing ways to structurethe information contained in them (see Briscoe {199l)and references therein), l'h~rther advances yet can bemade by using LKB types to chLssify words in text eofpora.
Suplmse , for example, we lit,ked the input andontl)ut of lexical rules to semantically tagged subcat-egorization frames extracted from bracketed corpora|(Poznafiski & Sautillppo, 1993).
As indicated in Fig 6,this would allow us to assess which alternations mightbe of interest in establishing regular verb sense/usageshifts.
Such an assessment wonhl provide an effectiveway to drive verb categorization from corpora in thedomain of valency alternations.6 F ina l  RemarksA key element in our approach to \]exica\[ acquisitionand representation f verbal diathesis concerns tim useof semantics constraints in formulating MI{I) queriesand characterizing FS descriptions.
This practice n-sttres that the results achieved in this work for ,n(>tiou verbs can be suitably extended to other semanticverb classes.
For example, the c\[tuss of verbs which un-dergo "extraposition" --e.g.
That Kim left early both-ers Sue vs.
It bothers 5'ue that Kim left early-- canbe identified by using semantic onstraints on MK1)queries which identify psychological verbs with stimu-Ills subject such as bother, please, etc.
(Sanfilippo &Poznatiski, 1992).
This approach provides an effectiveway of employing semiautomatic extraction of infor-mation from MIt,1)s for lexicon construction, and itfacilitates word classification from text corpora whenco,npiling new dictionary datab~es.ReferencesP, riseoe, T.
