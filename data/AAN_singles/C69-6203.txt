Problems of German-English Automatic TranslationPaul O. SamuelsdorffI.
Aims and methodThe aim of any Automatic Translation project is to givea mechanical procedure for finding an equivalent ex-pression in the target lan6uage for any sentence in thesource lan6uage.
The aim of any lin6uistic translationproject is to find the corresponding structures of thelanguages dealt with.
With both of these aims in mind,the empirical method was adopted in the project describ-ed in this paper.2.
Structure of the dictionar 7Two dictionaries are needed: an idiomatic d ic t io~ anda lexical dictionary.
Both have next to each English en-try the Gex~an equivalent (or equivalents) and the syn-tactic and semantic information needed for producing acorrect German sentence (and for choosing the correctequivalent, if necessary).
The lexlcal dictionary may,for technical reasons, be subdivided into a dictionaryfor words of high frequency and a dictionary for wordso f  low frequency.3.
Syntactic Problems3.1.
Morphological problems: choosin 6 the correct Germansuffixes.3.2.
I~x loo18~cal  problems: choosing the correct Germanarticle, pronoun or relative pronoun.3.3- Word order :  f ind ing  the  cor rec t  s t ruc ture  of  Germanword-8~oups and sentences  fo r  the  cor respond ing  Eng l i shs t ruc ture .~.
Semantic Problems~.I.
Solvable problems: the correct German equivalent ofan ambiguous English word may be found by testin 6 theenvironment.4.2.
Partially solvable problems: the correct Germanequivalent can only be found by approximation.
Possiblesolutions will be suggested.5- ExamplesExamples will be given to all of the above problems.4
