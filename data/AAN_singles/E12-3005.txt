Itis important to recognise such differencesand understand that biomedical tools thatwork well on some subdomains may notwork as well on others.
We report hereon the semantic variations that occur inthe sublanguages of two biomedical subdo-mains, i.e.
cell biology and pharmacology,at the level of named entity information.
Bybuilding a classifier using ratios of namedentities as features, we show that named en-tity information can discriminate betweendocuments from each subdomain.
Morespecifically, our classifier can distinguishbetween documents belonging to each sub-domain with an accuracy of 91.1% F-score.1 IntroductionBiomedical information extraction efforts in thepast decade have focussed on fundamental tasksneeded to create intelligent systems capableof improving search engine results and easingthe work of biologists.
More specifically, re-searchers have concentrated mainly on named en-tity recognition, mapping them to concepts incurated databases (Krallinger et al 2008) andextracting simple binary relations between enti-ties.
Recently, an increasing number of resourcesthat facilitate the training of systems to extractmore detailed information have become available,e.g., PennBioIE (Kulick et al 2004), GENE-TAG (Tanabe et al 2005), BioInfer (Pyysalo etal., 2007), GENIA (Kim et al 2008), GREC(Thompson et al 2009) and Metaknowledge GE-NIA (Thompson et al 2011).
Moreover, severalother annotated corpora have been developed forshared task purposes, such as BioCreative I, II, III(Arighi et al 2011) and BioNLP Shared Tasks2009 and 2011 (Cohen et al 2009; Kim et al2011).Many of the tools currently used for biomedi-cal language processing were trained and evalu-ated on such popular corpora, most of which con-sist of documents from the molecular biology sub-domain.
However, previous studies (discussed inSection 2) have established that different biomed-ical sublanguages exhibit linguistic variations.
Itfollows that tools which were developed and eval-uated on corpora derived from one subdomainmight not always perform as well on corpora fromother subdomains.
Understanding these linguisticvariations is essential to the process of adaptat-ing natural language processing tools to new do-mains.In this paper, we highlight the variations be-tween biomedical sublanguages by focussing onthe different types of named entities (NEs) thatare relevant to them.
We show that the frequen-cies of different named entity types vary enoughto allow a classifier for scientific subdomains tobe built based upon them.The study is performed on open access jour-nal articles present in the UK PubMed Central1(UKPMC) (McEntyre et al 2010), an articledatabase that extends the functionality of the orig-inal PubMed Central (PMC) repository2.
Thisdatabase was chosen as our source, since most ofthe documents within it are already tagged withnamed entity information.
We report here on theresults obtained for two biomedical subdomains,1http://ukpmc.ac.uk/2http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc38i.e.
cell biology and pharmacology.
Our focus onthese two particular subdomains is motivated byan increasing interest expressed by the biomedi-cal research community, according to recent find-ings that have shown their relevance to discover-ing possible causes and treatments for incurablediseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer?s Disease.2 Related workHarris (1968) introduced a formalisation of thenotion of sublanguage, which was defined as asubset of general language.
According to thistheory, it is possible to process specialised lan-guages, since they have a structure that can be ex-pressed in a computable form.
More recently, sev-eral works on the study of biomedical languagessubstantiated his theory.For instance, Sager et al(1987) worked onpharmacological literature and lipid metabolism,whereas Friedman et al(2002) analysed the prop-erties of clinical and biomolecular sublanguages.Other studies have investigated the differ-ences between general and biomedical lan-guages by focussing on specific linguistic aspects,such as verb-argument relations and pronomi-nal anaphora.
For instance, Wattarujeekrit et al(2004) analysed the predicate-argument structuresof 30 verbs used in biomedical articles.
Their re-sults suggest that, in certain cases, a significantdifference exists in the predicate frames comparedto those obtained from analysing news articles inthe PropBank project (Palmer et al 2005).
Sim-ilarly, based on the GENIA and PennBioIE cor-pora, Cohen et al(2008) performed a study ofargument realisation with respect to the nominal-isation and alternation of biomedical verbs.
Theyconcluded that there is a high occurrence of thesephenomena in this semantically restricted do-main, and underline that this sublanguage modelapplies only to biomedical language.Taking a different angle, Nguyen and Kim(2008) examined the differences in the use ofpronouns by studying general domains (MUCand ACE) and one biomedical domain (GENIA).They observed that compared to the MUC andACE corpora, the GENIA corpus has significantlymore occurrences of neutral and third-person pro-nouns, whilst first and second person pronounsare non-existent.Verspoor et al(2009) measured lexical andstructural variation in biomedical Open Accessjournals and subscription-based journals, con-cluding that there are no significant differencesbetween them.
Therefore, a model trained on oneof these sources can be used successfully on theother, as long as the subject matter is maintained.Furthermore, they compared a mouse genomicscorpus with two reference corpora, one composedof newswire texts and another of general biomed-ical articles.
In this case, unsurprisingly, signifi-cant differences were found across many linguis-tic dimensions.
Relevant to our study is the com-parison between the more specific mouse genomecorpus to the more general biomedical one: whilstsimilar from some points of view, such as nega-tion and passivisation, they differ in sentencelength and semantic features, such as the presenceof various named entities.Our work is most similar to that of Lippincottet al(2011), in which a clustering-based quantita-tive analysis of the linguistic variations across 38different biomedical sublanguages is presented.They investigated four dimensions relevant to theperformance of NLP systems, i.e.
vocabulary,syntax, semantics and discourse structure.
Withregard to semantic features, the authors induceda topic model using Latent Dirichlet Analysis foreach word, and then extended the model to docu-ments and subdomains according to observed dis-tributions.
Their conclusion is that a machinelearning system is able to create robust clustersof subdomains, thus proving their hypothesis thatthe commonly used molecular biology subdomainis not representative of the domain as a whole.In contrast, we examine the differences be-tween biomedical sublanguages at the semanticlevel, using only named entities.
Furthermore,we choose to perform our analysis only on twosubdomains (i.e.
cell biology and pharmacology),and try to classify these by using supervised ma-chine learning algorithms.3 MethodologyWe designed an experiment in which various ma-chine learning algorithms are trained and testedon data obtained from open access journal arti-cles.
Firstly, a corpus of articles was created (Sec-tion 3.1), after which the documents were auto-matically annotated with named entities (Section3.2).
We then extracted a number features rele-vant to the named entities present in the corpus(Section 3.3).393.1 Corpus developmentOur corpus was created by first searching theNLM Catalog3 for journals whose Broad Sub-ject Term attributes contain only cell biology orpharmacology, and then narrowing down the re-sults to those which are in English and avail-able via PubMed Central.
Also, since we areconcentrating on full-text documents, we retainedonly those journals that are available within thePubMed Open Access subset4.
According to thisprocedure, we obtained a final list of two journalsfor cell biology and six for pharmacology.Using the PMC IDs of all articles publishedin the selected journals, we retrieved documentsfrom UK PubMed Central.
This database waschosen as our source as the documents it containsare already tagged with named entity information.A total of 360 articles was retrieved for each cat-egory, i.e.
cell biology and pharmacology.The retrieved documents were encoded inXML format.
Several unusable fragments wereremoved before converting them to plain text.
Ex-amples of such fragments are article metadata (au-thors, their affiliations, publishing history, etc.
),tables, figures and references.
Table 1 shows thestatistics regarding the corpus following the ap-plication of the pre-processing step.
In the caseof pharmacology, the document collection con-tains almost 1.4 million words, whilst the set ofcell biology articles consists of almost 2.5 millionwords.
The ratio of named entities to the totalnumber of words is almost the same in the twocollections, i.e.
about 10%.Subdomain Cell biology PharmacologyNo.

NeMine and OSCAR.
The types ofentities in the output be each of the two tools, to-gether with the NE types present in the UKPMCarticles, are summarised in Table 2.Named entities in the UKPMC database wereidentified using NeMine (Sasaki et al 2008), adictionary-based statistical named entity recogni-tion system.
This system was later extended andused by Nobata et al(2009) to recognise moretypes, such as phenomena, processes, organs andsymptoms.
We used this most recent version ofthe software as our second source of more diverseentity types.The Open-Source Chemistry Analysis Rou-tines (OSCAR) software (Jessop et al 2011) isa toolkit for the recognition of named entities anddata in chemistry publications.
Currently in itsfourth version, it uses three types of chemical en-tity recognisers, namely regular expressions, pat-terns and Maximum Entropy Markov models.In total, 20 different classes of entities wereconsidered in this study.
However, due to thecombination of several NERs, some NE types areidentified by more than one NER.
Furthermore,some of the NE types are more general and coverother more specific types, which are also anno-tated by one or mroe of the tools.
This can lead todouble annotation.
For instance, the Gene|Proteintype is more general than both Gene and Protein,whereas the Chemical molecule type is a hyper-nym of Gene, Protein, Drug and Metabolite.
Inthe case of multiple annotations over the samespan of text, we removed the more general labels,so that each NE has only one label.
Contradictorycases, where two NERs label one NE with com-pletely different tags, were not found.After augmenting the existing NEs by runningthe two NER tools on the corpus, the outputs werecombined to give a single ?silver?
annotation list.This operation was performed by computing themathematical union of the three individual anno-tation sets, as shown in Equation 1.ASilver = AUKPMC ?

It can be observed that some entitytypes have approximately the same percentages inthe two subdomains, e.g.
phenomena and reac-tions.
However, large differences can be observedin the case of some of the other entity types.
Forinstance, chemical molecules occur twice as of-ten in pharmacology articles than in cell biology,whereas proteins appear almost three times moreoften in cell biology than in pharmacology.3.3 Experimental setupUsing the corpus described previously, we cre-ated a training set for supervised machine learn-ing algorithms.
Every document in the corpuswas transformed into a vector consisting of 20features.
Each of these features corresponds toan entity type in Table 2, having a numeric valueranging from 0 to 1.
This number represents theratio of the specific entity type to the total numberof named entities recognised in that document, asshown in Equation 2.?
=ntypeN(2)where ntype represents the number of NEs of acertain type in a document and N represents thetotal number of NEs in that document.Furthermore, each vector was labelled with thesubdomain to which the respective document be-longs (i.e., cell biology or pharmacology).Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005; Hall et al2009) was employed as the machine learningframework, due to its large variety of classifica-tion algorithms.
We experimented with a largenumber of classifiers, ranging from Bayesian netsto functions, decision trees, decision rules andmeta-classifiers.
The best performing classifiersare shown in Table 4.
BayesNet is an implemen-tation of Bayesian Networks, SMO is an imple-mentation of Support Vector Machines, J48 is animplementation of decision trees, whilst Jrip is animplementation of decision rules.
Random For-est is an ensemble classifier that consists of manydecision trees (in this study, J48 was used), out-putting the class that occurs most frequently in theoutput of individual trees.The baseline that has been used is ZeroR, a sim-ple algorithm that classifies all instances as per-taining to the majority class.
Since our classeshave equal numbers of instances, the F-score ofZeroR is 50%.41Type CellBio PharmaEnzyme 0.05% 0.09%Bacteria 0.01% 0.16%Chemical adjective ?0% ?0%Chemical molecule 30.13% 60.86%Diagnose process 0.03% 0.23%Disease 3.35% 4.27%Drug 1.25% 2.83%Gene 0.87% 1.09%Gene|Protein 5.02% 0.89%General phenomenon ?0% 0.01%Human phenomenon 0% ?0%Indicator 0.36% 0.16%Metabolite 3.26% 7.53%Natural phenomenon 0.02% 0.1%Organ 0.09% 0.27%Pathologic function 0.04% 0.04%Protein 53.31% 19.13%Reaction 1.71% 1.31%Symptom 0.03% 0.06%Therapeutic process 0.47% 0.96%Table 3: Ratios of NE types to the total number of NEsin the two subdomains.4 ResultsThe previously described features were used as in-put to various supervised machine learning algo-rithms; results and error analysis are provided inSection 4.1 and Section 4.2, respectively.4.1 Experimental resultsAs can be seen from Table 4, Random Forestperforms best, with 91.1% F-score.
The otherthree classifiers give lower results, varying be-tween 86% and 89.5%.Algorithm P R F1BayesNet 89.5 89.4 89.4SMO 86.1 86.1 86.1JRip 87.8 87.8 87.8J48 86.8 86.8 86.8Random Forest 91.3 91.1 91.1Table 4: Classification results for the best-performingalgorithms.We also employed AdaBoost in conjunctionwith the previously mentioned four classifiers,and the results are given in Table 5.
AdaBoostis a meta-algorithm that adapts itself during thecourse of several iterations in the sense that ineach iteration, classifiers built are tweaked to cor-rect those instances misclassified by prior classi-fiers.
In this study, AdaBoost was run over 20iterations, and it significantly improved the resultof J48, by almost 4%, to 90.3%.
However, Ad-aBoost decreased the F-score of Random Forestby 1% and that of BayesNet by 0.3%.Algorithm P R F1BayesNet 89.2 89.2 89.2SMO 86.1 86.1 86.1JRip 87.9 87.9 87.9J48 90.3 90.3 90.3Random Forest 90.3 90.1 90.1Table 5: Classification results for AdaBoost in con-junction with the best-performing algorithms.In order to determine which features have themost influence on classification, regardless ofthe classifying algorithm, two attribute evaluatorswere used to measure the information gain foreach feature and to compute the value of the chi-squared statistic with respect to the class.
The val-ues obtained are shown in Table 6, and to illustratetheir influence, are plotted in Figure 1, after beingnormalised.Unsurprisingly, Protein is the feature with themost discriminatory power, considering it has thehighest count and it occurs almost three timesmore often in the cell biology class than in thepharmacology class.
Chemical molecules followclosely, again due to a high count and large differ-ence between the classes.
Due to their high scoresobtained from the attribute evaluators, we ran theexperiment again considering only these two fea-tures.
The Random Forest classifier achieved anF-score of 80% using these parameters.At the other end of the scale, there are fivefeatures which have very little influence in dis-criminating between the two classes.
The corre-sponding named entity types have the lowest oc-currence counts in the corpora, with the exceptionof Organ.
When running Random Forest withthese five features only, an F-score of 50.5% isobtained.
This result is very close to the baseline,surpassing it by only a small fraction.4.2 Error analysisAs can be seen in Table 7, a total of 64 paperswere misclassified by the Random Forest classi-42Attribute InfoGain ChiSquareProtein 0.4482 386.5648Chemical molecule 0.3169 272.0111Gene|Protein 0.2265 211.8034Indicator 0.1805 170.0186Gene 0.1718 156.9504Metabolite 0.1667 155.8135Reaction 0.1545 144.6946Drug 0.1301 124.2604Therapeutic process 0.1259 111.4571Disease 0.1189 111.1882Chemical adjective 0.0642 55.5556Enzyme 0.0473 41.089Diagnostic process 0.0388 32.1161Bacteria 0.0297 26.0522Natural phenomenon 0.0227 20.8004Pathologic function 0 0Symptom 0 0General phenomenon 0 0Organ 0 0Human phenomenon 0 0Table 6: Attribute selection output from two attributeevaluators.fier, the best performing algorithm.
Of these, 45(i.e.
70%) are cell biology papers which were in-correctly classified as belonging to pharmacology,whilst the remaining 19 belong to the pharmacol-ogy class and are classified as cell biology.Labelled as Cell_bio PharmaCell_bio 315 19Pharma 45 341Table 7: Confusion matrix for the Random Forest clas-sifier.As previously mentioned, the two features thatachieved the highest information gain are the ra-tios for the Protein and Chemical molecule types.Accordingly, only these two features were consid-ered in this error analysis.We firstly examined the features of the cellbiology documents which were incorrectly clas-sified as pharmacology papers.
It was notice-able that the majority of the misclassified doc-uments in this case have a small percentage ofProteins (less than 0.35) and/or a large percent-age of Chemical molecules (greater than 0.58).
Toconfirm this observation, a sample of documents00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.45 InfoGainChiSquareProteinChemical moleculeGene|ProteinIndicator GeneMetaboliteReaction DrugTherapeuticprocessDiseaseChemical adjectiveEnzymeDiagnosticprocessBacteriaNatural phenomenonPathologicfunctionSymptomGeneral phenomenonOrganHuman phenomenonFigure 1: Normalised attribute selection output fromtwo attribute evaluators.was accessed via the PubMed Central page whichprovides links to identified entities such as com-pounds, substances, genes and proteins.
For in-stance, the misclassified cell biology paper withPMCID 2755470 was found to have no proteins,whilst the one with PMCID 2679709 has quite alarge number of substances (chemical molecules).We also analysed the features of papers in thepharmacology subdomain which were misclassi-fied as cell biology documents.
In contrast tothe first type of misclassification, these documentshave a large percentage of Proteins and/or smallpercentage of Chemical molecules.
For example,the pharmacology paper with PMCID 2817930contains many protein instances, whilst the onewith PMCID 2680808 has no mentions of chemi-cal molecules.5 Conclusions and Future WorkWe have shown that with the help of named en-tity identification, classifiers can be built that areable to distinguish between papers belonging todifferent biomedical subdomains.
The RandomForest algorithm is able to discriminate betweencell biology and pharmacology open-access full-text articles with an F-score of 91%.
This resultsupports the hypothesis that sublanguages used indifferent biomedical domains exhibit significantsemantic variations.
Such variations should there-fore be considered when adapting automated tools43developed for a particular subdomain to new sub-domains.One possible future direction is to analyse mul-tiple medical subdomains, such as neurology, vi-rology and critical care.
This could enable themeasurement of the distance between various sub-domains with respect to specific named entitytypes.
Furthermore, a comparison of the methoddescribed above with those using bag-of-wordsor other non-semantic features could further en-force the importance of named entities in doc-ument classification and sublanguage identifica-tion.AcknowledgementsWe would like to acknowledge the help givenby Dr. C.J.
