Hand-crafted rule based systems provide good performance at a relatively highsystem engineering cost.
The availability of a large collection of annotated data is the prerequisite for us-ing supervised learning techniques.
Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques promise fastdeployment for many NE types without the prerequisite of an annotated corpus.
The main technique forsemi-supervised learning is called bootstrapping and involves a small degree of supervision, such as a setof seeds, for starting the learning process.
The typical approach in unsupervised learning is clusteringwhere systems can try to gather NEs from clustered groups based on the similarity of context.
The tech-niques rely on lexical resources (e.g., Wordnet), on lexical patterns and on statistics computed on a largeunannotated corpus.In multilingual named entity recognition (NER), it must be possible to use the same method for manydifferent languages and the extension to new languages must be easy and fast.
Person names can be rec-ognized in text through a lookup procedure, by analyzing the local lexical context, by looking at part of asequence of candidate words that is a known name component etc.
Some organization names can be iden-tified by looking at contain organization-specific candidate words.
Identification of place names necessar-ily involves lookup against a gazetteer, as most context markers are too weak and ambiguous.An important feature in multilingual person name detection is that the same person can be referred to bydifferent name variants.
The main reasons for these variations are: the reuse of name parts to avoid repeti-tion, morphological variants such as the added suffixes, spelling mistakes, adaptation of names to localspelling rules, transliteration differences due to different transliteration rules or different target languagesetc.. Name variants can be found within the same language documents.The major challenges for looking up place names in a multilingual gazetteer are the following: placenames are frequently homographic with common words or with person names, presence of a number ofexonyms (foreign language equivalences), endonyms (local variants) and historical variants for manyplace names etc..Application of NER to multilingual document sets helps to find more and more accurate informa-tionon each NE, while at the same time rich in-formation about NEs is helpful and can even be a crucialingredient for text analysis applications that cross the language barrier.34
