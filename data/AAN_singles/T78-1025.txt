SEMANTIC PRIMITIVES IN LANGUAGE AND VISIONYorick WilksDepartment of Language and L ingu is t i csUn ivers i ty  of EssexColchester,  England.The purpose of th i s  b r ie f  note is to arguethat ,  whatever the jus t i f i ca t ion  of semanticp r imi t lves  for  language understanding may be \[seeWilks 1977\] there is no reason to bel ieve that i tre lates to v i s ion  in any strong sense.By "semantic p r imi t ives"  I mean the generalsort  of  item proposed w i th in  Ar t i f i c ia l  In te l l i -gence (AI) by Wllks (1972, 1977), Schank (1973)and w i th in  l ingu is t i cs  by Fodor and Katz (1963),Jackendoff (1975) among many others ,  in both cases.The genera l i ty  of these items is essent ia l  to myargument, and I shal l  not count as semanticp r imi t ives  items used for  special tasks, whetheror not those tasks are related to v i s ion ,  as arethe v isual  descr ip t ion  pr imi t ives  of Johnson-Laird (1977).Spat ia l  versus v isua lWhat fo l lows is h igh ly  naive and specu-la t ive :  i t  w i l l  rest la rge ly  upon the opposit ionof  l ingu is t i c  knowledge to spat ia l  and v isualknowledge respect ive ly .
I take i t  for  grantedthat  the la t te r  are not necessar i ly  connected,and so to es tab l i sh  that  ~e need spat ia l  know-ledge to understand language (to name a task atrandom) does not es tab l i sh  that we need v isualknowledge.
The lack of necessary connexion isshown by such hackneyed examples as the personb l ind  from b i r th ,  who has no v i sua l ,  but a greatdeal of spat ia l ,  knowledge.One in i t ia l  reason for  d i s t ingu ish ing  the twois the great deal of  argumentation in l ingu is t i csin recent years that  fa l l s  under the generalheading Iocal ism.
This th rust  of argumentationhas sought to es tab l i sh  the central  ro le of spat ia lconcepts in l ingu is t i cs ,  and among i t s  best knownproponents are Anderson (1971), F i l lmore (1977)and Jackendoff (1975).
One stand in th i s  view isto argue that  temporal express iomare in generalreducable, in some sense, to spat ia l  ones: thatin ten minutes (a time expression) is dependenton the spat ia l  sense of such forms as in f i vemiles.
This is a very d i f f i cu l t  and generaldebate: there is contrary evidence from cu l tureswhere space is indicated by time (The a i rpor t  isi.S about ten mlnutes a~az), and there is a strongph i losophica l  t rad i t ion ,  centred round Kant, thatour sense of  time is log ica l ly  p r io r  to our senseof space.
That Is to say, we could conceive ofs t ruc tur ing  our experience wi thout  the concept ofspace, but not w i thout  that of time because, i f  wecould not know that  one event preceded another,then we could probably not know anything at a l l ;not even mathematics i f  that  consists at bottom insequences of operat ions.
Michotte 's  famousexperiments on the w i l l ingness  of subjects toattach the word cause to moving p ictures  of pai rsof "s t r i k ing  b i l l i a rd  ba l l s "  is sometimes c i tedas prov id ing a v isua l  basis for  causa l i ty  (Clarke& Clark 1977), although the not ion of causa l i tymay wel l  in fact  make no sense wi thout  theconcept of time.
We could assert (wrongly, as i thappens) that  l ighten ing  causes thunder wi thoutthe aid of  a spat ia l  concept, but not w i thout  atemporal one.The log ica l  or l ingu is t i c  p r iq r i ty  of spaceto time is by no means a set t led  matter,  andne i ther  therefore is the thesis  of local ism.
Ihave argued that  the role of the v isua l  inlanguage is not necessar i ly  supported by the needfor  spat ia l  knowledge, and so the status of  thela t te r  need not be discussed.
Nonetheless, Ihave questioned the se l f -ev ident ia l  t ru th  of180Iocal ism, jus t  in case anyone should think that ,i f  i t  were t rue,  i t  would support the cent ra l i ty  ofv isual  knowledge in language understanding.Let us now, as the br ie f  substance of  th ispaper, look at three arguments that might be putforward to support the dependence, or in ter -dependence, of l i ngu is t i c  and visual knowledge.Evolut ionary ar~umantsThis comes in phylogenetic and ontogenetlcforms.
The former is the ingenious argument(Gregory 1970) that ,  since the human race has beenable to see for  many times more mi l len ia  than i thas been able to speak or wr i te ,  then i t  mightseem reasonable to be l ieve,  on evo lut ionarygrounds that the brain "took over" the ex is t ingvisual  structures for  language understanding andproduction.
This argument may well  be true,  butat present there is no independent evidence thatwould count for  or against i t .The "ontogenetic form" of the argument - inthe ind iv idua l ,  that is - is that one f i r s t  learnswords essent ia l l y  through the visual channel, andso again our l ingu is t i c  knowledge is essent ia l l ydependent upon visual c r i te r ia  and experience.The best quick answer is to turn to the sort  ofword often used as a semantic p r imi t ive  in AIlanguage understanding systems: STUFF (=substance),ATRANS (=changing the ownership of an ent i ty ) ,CAUSE (=preceding and necess i tat ing an event).I t  is h ighly dubious that such very generalconcepts are, or can be, taught by v i sua l /ostensive methods.
Can one point  at substance assuch?
One may want, or mean, to, but can one infact re l iab ly  do so?One structure for  many purposesThis is a widespread view in AI that has beenargued for exp l i c i t l y  by Hinsky (1975) and Rieger(1976), among others.
Roughly speaking, i t  isthat implemented systems should use a s ingleknowledge structure for  a range of purposes:language understanding, problem solv ing,  etc.I t  is an addi t iona l  assumption that human beingsdo funct ion in th is  way.The thesis can be expressed at many leve ls ,and at a su f f i c ient ly  general level i t  is almostcer ta in ly  true.
But i t  might then mean no morethan that a s ingle programming language couldexpress general sub-routlnes for  parsing, noisereduction etc.
for  a number of  input channels.At a more spec i f i c  level was the thesis ,  not nowwidely supported, that language and v is ion  in somesense shared the same "grammar", in the sense ofChomsky's transformational  grammar (Clowes 1972).S t r ik ing  evidence from the para l le l i sm betweenvisual and l ingu is t i c  ambiguity was found, and thefact that Chomsky's grammars no longer seem suchp laus ib le  candidates for  such a ro le does not meanthat the thesis i t se l f  is fa lse at that leve l .Let us concentrate for  a moment on two morespec i f i c  leve ls .
F i r s t ,  consider the well-knowncontrast between such sentences as:The paper movedThe dog movedLinguists who d i f fe r  about much else wouldwant to ascribe a notion of agency to the subjectof  the second sentence but not the f i r s t .
Hanyin AI working on natural language would agree, andadd that the notion of agency is essent ia l  i f  otherimportant inferences are to be made.
But, surelyno one would argue that agency is ,  in any usefulsense ascribed a visual  c r i te r ia ,  that could bereduced to the visual d i f ferences of  paper anddogs.
I t  is in fact a complex theoret ica l  notiondependent upon our be l ie fs  and theories about theworld: we do not now at t r ibute  agency to trees,though some fe l low humans do.
But th is  d i f ferenceis a theoret ica l  ( inc luding l ingu is t i c )  one, notone of  d i f ference of visual perception.Secondly, we may return to general semanticp r imi t ives  of  the sort already mentioned (ands imi la r  inventor ies may be found in (Bierwisch1970) and (Leech 1974)).There are many possible ways in which onemight seek to jus t i fy  such pr imi t ives  (see Wilks1977), and Bierwisch (1970) has gone on recordas saying that they do denote, and are to thatextent dependent upon v i sua l ly  observableent i t ies .
I suggested above that that may not beso: one may point  at t reac le ,  water or elephantmeats but i t  is not so c lear  one can point  atSUBSTANCE, yet th is  notion has a role to play inlanguage understanding for  how, without i t ,  canone economically express such axioms as "Aquant i ty  of  a substance plus a quant l t~of  i t181y ie ld  a quant i ty  3 of i t " .
This axiom is not trueof  physical objects,  as d i s t inc t  from substances.A well-known confusion must be avoided here:i t  may well  be true,  as the model theoret icsemanticists l i ke  Montague claim, that anycontentfu l  not ion,  p r imi t ive  or not,  refers to afunct ion of  sets.
In that sense move might besaid to refer  to a set of  ent i t ies  that move.However, th is  point  about logica l  referencehas no consequences for  the point  about whetheror not such pr imi t ives  denote ent i t ies  in thereal world.Visual and spat ia l  imageryF ina l ly ,  i t  is sometimes argued that thestructures underlying language must depend uponthose underlying v is ion  i f  only because naturallanguage is so fu l l  o f  v isual  imagery.
Inwhatever sense "v isua l  imagery" is taken, th isfact  is ,  I be l ieve,  i r re levant  to any preciseassert ion under discussion, by which I mean any ofI )  Language understanding processes in humansdepend, e i ther  as to p r imi t ive  elements ors t ructure,  on visual  experience and themechanisms that in terpret  i t .I I )  The spec i f i ca t ion  of  language in humans hasno s ign i f i cant  over lap,  in terms of  p r imi t iveelements or s t ructure,  with that of otherfacu l t ies ,  l i ke  v i s ion .I I I )  Visual processes in humans depend, e i ther  asto elements or s t ructure,  on l ingu is t i cexperience and the mechanisms that in terpretand produce (sic) i t .For a l l  three theses only anecdotal evidenceis ava i lab le ,  though I would be strengthened byempir ical  evidence that the b l ind from b i r th  wereless able to understand the use o f~sua l  imageryin language.
Those with a prede l l c t ion  for  motortheories should be tempted to consider the Whorfianthesis I I I  (Whorl, remember, bel ieved we mightperceive, say l ightn ing ,  as an ent i ty ,  rather thanan ac t iv i ty  or process because we denoted i t  bya member of the theoret ica l  category NOUN, ratherthan VERB) since, as the st ructura l  d i f ference ofI and I I I  makes c lear ,  language is an ac t iv i ty  ina way v is ion  is not.Thesis I I  w i l l  be agreeable to those who areimpressed by the way in which confusion can ar isewhen one t r ies  to br ing together information onthe same top ic ,  but obtained v ia d i f fe rentchannels.
As when one refers to two c i t ies  whosemutual re la t ion  of  pos i t ion  one knows from a map;between which one can dr ive "without  th ink ing" ;and also about both of  which one has a great dealof  textua l / fac tua l  information.
Readers of(Fillmore 1977) wi l l  feca l |  his attempt todescribe the re la t ion  of  a text-based frame andan exper ient ia l l y -based  scene to the same, ,s i tuat ion .
I th ink AI workers at th is  par t i cu la rinter face could pro f i t  from considering theextent to which such possible inconsistenciescan be matters of  theory rather than super f i c ia lfact :  an observer who is asked whether two sidesof  a long ra i lway l ine  meet at the fur thest  pointhe can see w i l l  give an answer not independentof  of  his abstract (possibly l ingu is t i ca l l y  based)theory of  para l le l  l ines.In conclusion, th is  note has t r ied  to do nomore than ward o f f  certa in  confusions, and tostress how many points of  view are s t i l l  open,stnce the evidence for  and against them is nomore than anecdotal,  even when the anecdotes comefrom Psychology labs.
The choice between theses1/11/111 is a metaphysical one, in the more red-blooded sense of  that over t i red  word: i t  cannotbe made on empir ical  grounds now, but i t  can haveimportant pract ica l  consequences about where onechooses to look for  answers.182ReferencesAnderson, J.
