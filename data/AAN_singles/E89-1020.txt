653390, Telex 1189t-icpci-rABSTRACTThe paper proposes a paradigmatic approach tomorphological knowledge acquisition.
It ad-dresses the problem of learning from examplesrules for word-forms analysis and synthesis.These rules, established by generalizing the train-ing data sets, are effectively used by a built-in in-terpreter which acts consequently as amorphological processor within the architectureof a natural anguage question-answering system.The PARADIGM system has no a priori knowledgewhich should restrict it to a particular natural an-guage, but instead builds up the morphologicalrules based only on the examples provided, bethey in Romanian, English, French, Russian, SIo-vak and the like.1.
INTRODUCTIONFor highly Inflexlonal languages, encoding allword forms Into a word lexicon (declarative mor-phology approach) appears to be a poor solutionnot only due to a great redundancy (which forsome languages is prohibitive (Japplnen,t983))but also with respect to some theoretical aspects(as for Instance descr ipt ional  adequacy(Wehrli,1985)).Within an Inflexional morphology environment(Alshawl, t985), we propose a procedural ap-proach based on automatically acquired flexlo-nlng paradigms.
The paradigmatic model isIncorporated Into an experimental system calledPARADIGM, which Is Intended to (partially) re-place the acquisition and modelling part of ourMORPHO lex icon management system(Tufis,1987a) incorporated by the lURES environ-ment for building natural language applications(Tufts, 1985).tioned motivations.
With respect to the secondone maybe it is worth saying that when PARA-DIGM lacks appropriate or complete knowledge Itis supposed to act the same way a child or aforeign speak partner does.
That is, for instance,to say "goed" or "womens" ff the corresponding ir-regularity is unknown.
The reason for such a de-cision stems mainly from our attempt to study inparallel with the implementation, the effectivenessof language learning based on Informal examples.From the linguistic engineering point of view, thepurpose of the system is stated very pragmati-cally, that is to ease and speed up as much aspossible the building of language specific mor-phological knowledge bases without (too much)help from theoretical morphologists, experts onthe language concerned.
It is not always easy tofind appropriate written material, not to speakabout human experts, presenting in a rigorousmanner (as imposed by computer applications)the rules and peculiarities of word structuring Indifferent languages.PARADIGM was conceived to overcome, at leastpartially, these difficulties and to provide a handytool for Immediate verification of specific rules va-lidity.
As the general situation is with learning sys-tems, different copies of PARADIGM may be useclin parallel and finally merge the Individually de-veloped knowledge bases.
This Is beneflclaly notonly with respect to the development ime but alsowith respect to the linguistic coverage.Architecturally, PARADIGM was Influenced byDISCIPLE ('recuci, 1988) in the sense that the be-havioral dichotomy "apprentice-expert" was Incor-porated into Its Implementation.
However, due tothe more specific task, the technical solutionsadopted in PARADIGM for knowledge acquisitionare different, being problem oriented.The aim of our work is twofold: to obtain a soundlinguistic toOl for word-forms analysis and syn-thesis (which In case of highly lnflexlonal lan-guages is by no means a trivial task) and toprovide for a psychologically motivated behaviourof such a system in dealing with unknown words.In the following, we shall dwell on the technical is-sues connected to the first of the above two men-2.
DEFINITIONS2.1 MORPHOLOGICAL MODELWe call a morphological model the tuple:MM = (C,SC,M,V, F1,F2,F3,P) where C is a set ofcategories: C = {cl ..... c*}; SC Is a set of sub-ca-tegories of the categories in C: SC = {scl ..... scJ};- 145  -M is a set of features of the sub-categories in SC:M = { m l ..... n~ }; V is a set of values which featurescan take: V = {vl ..... vm}; Ft Is a function definedon C, taking values in the power set of SC:Ft: C--- > PS(SC); F2 is a function defined on SC,taking values in the power set of M:F2: SC--- > PS(M); F3 is a function defined on M,taking values in the power set of V: F3:M---> PS(V); P is a subset of the Cartesian pro-duct C x SC x P(M) x P(V) so that Vpi = (ci,so,Mi,Vt)E P the following are true: cl~ C & so E SC & Mi c M& V IcV  & scl~Fl(ci)  & Ml=F2(sci) &Mi = {rr~l ..... m ik}& Vi = {vii ..... VIk} & Vq~ \[1,k|viq~ F3(miq) P is called the paradigmatic ftexio-ning space of the morphological model MM.
Forinstance a point of P in a certain MM might be:(noun common-noun(gender number case articulation)(masculine plural genitive definite))2.2.
THEMATIC FAMILIESWe call a thematic family ('rF) the set of all word-forms of a given (lemma) word, obtained by gram-matical Inflecting: TF= {W1 ..... Wm}.
Let usconsider a TF to be always lexicograpHIcallysorted.
Let <X> denote an arbitrary string ofcharacters and < X > < Y > the string obtained byconcatenating the substrings <X > and <Y >.We say that a TF Is regular iff there Is a q-lettersubstring < Rq > called root, common to all the mwords of TF so that:la )V i<Wi> ETF, <Wi> = <Rq> <e i>lb) < Rq > is the longest substrlng with theproperty 1 a)lc) q > = low-limit (an Integer varying from lan-guage to language)I d) VIe \[2,m-1 \] the subsets { < W1 > ..... < Wi > }and {<Wl+l> ..... <Win>} give the roots<Rq l> and <Rq2> with <Rql > being a sub-string of < Rqa > or at most equal to < Rq2 >.The remainlng part of a word in TF alter remov-ing the root is called an ending (we use the term'ending' to Include both deslnences and suffixes).The list of all endlngs obtained from a TF Is calleda paradigmatic endings family (PEF).A thematic family is called partial regular if thereIs a partition of TF = {TF1 ,TF2 ..... TFk} so that:2a) lJTFi =TF & Vl,J(l~,J) TF in  TF)= ?~2b) VI (TFi is regular & CARD(TFI) > 1).According to the above definition, a partial-regu-lar TF will be characterized by k roots.
A thematicfamily which is neither regular nor partial-regularIs called Irregular.In the following, in order to simplify notations,when referring to strings of characters, we use an-gular brackets only if we need to outline a compo-sition/decomposition of a word-form.A central notion of our approach is that of flex-toning paradigm.
Its meaning is similar to thatused by most of the morphologists.We define a flexlonlng paradigm Q as a list ofpairs: Q = {(el pl)(e2 p2)...(ek ~)}  where 'e' areendings extracted from a thematic family (irre-spective of their regularity) and 'pl' are appropri-ate points in P (the appropriateness will berevealed in the fourth chapter).2.3 UNINTERPRETED LEXICONLet LS be a set of words obtained fromthe unionof K thematic families, called a lexical stock:LS=TF1uTF2L J .
.
.uTFk .
We call an uninter-prated lexicon of the word stock LS a setUL = {R1,R2 ..... Rp} so that for any i~ \[1,p\] Ri is aroot of a certain TFi in LS.
The mappingh LS --- > PS(UL x P) Is called an Interpretation ofan UL within a morphological model MM (recallthat P Is a paradigmatic flexloning space of a cer-tain MM).
Let us observe that I mapping allows aword to be ambiguously interpreted, which isquite natural at the level of isolated word-form ana-lysis.
Such a common ambiguity, for Instance, isfigured out by the Romanlan word "modul", whichmay stand either for the unarttculated nomina-tive/accusative form of "modul" (module) or for thearticulated nominative/accusative form of "mod"(mode, manner).
The I mapping abstracts the pro-cess of word-forms analysis.
The abstraction ofthe reverse process, the generation of word-forms, Is represented by the mapping G definedas follows: G: Ul.xP --- > LS.
As opposed to I, G 18a univoque function, that Is for a given root and aspecific point in the paradigmatic flexioning pointP, a unique word-form will result.3.
BUILDING A MORPHOLOGICAL MODELTo build a morphological model the designerstarts by speclfiying the categories of interest Inhis/her application.
The traditional categories areNOUN, ADJECTIVE, VERB, PRONOUN and soforth, but by no means this categorlal system Is146 -obligatory (for instance one might think of usingsemantically flavoured categories such as OB-JECT, PROPERTY, ACTION, STATE, ANAPHORetc).For each defined category in C, the designer willbe asked to provide the desired sub-categories(for instance COMMON-NOUN and PROPER-NOUN for NOUN).
This activity Is equivalent In theformal model to defining the SC subset and the F1function.
Further, for each sub-category In SC thesystem asks the designer to enter the specific fea-tures along which the Inflexlonal behaviour of thewords gets relevant.
With Romanlan language forinstance, while number, case and enclitic articu-lation are relevant for COMMON-NOUN, for fe-min ine  PROPER-NOUN only the case Issignificant (but this is not always true: the feminineproper-nouns ending In a consonant, whatevertheir etimology, do not flexate at all).
By enteringall sub-category-features a sociations, the systemis implicitly provided with the M set and F2 func-tion.
Finally, for each feature in M, the designerwill be asked to define the possible values the cur-rent feature may take (e.g.
'singular' and 'plural'for the 'number' feature).
When the list of featuresIs exhausted, the system has already learnt the Vset and F3 mapping.
At this point, the activity ofthe designer Is theoretically finished and it is thesystem itself which wlU generate, based on thesedefinitions, the paradigmatic flexloning space (P),thus accompl ishing the MM internal repre-sentation.
From this Internal representation, thesystem generates for each defined sub-categorya graphic tabular menu (we call it an AcquisitionScenario AS) partlally filled In.
The only blank col-umn in an AS is called WORD-FORM column andis accessible for writing in by the trainer (tutor) ofthe system.
Each line In an AS Is filled (except thelast field corresponding to the WORD-FORM col-umn) by the Information uniquely Identifying epoint in P.4.
KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITIONWhen the tutor chooses a defined sub-categoryof a category in C to be exemplified, the systemanswers by displaying the associated acquisitionscenario.
What the tutor Is asked to do is to fill Inthe blanks the WORD-FORM column with the In.flected forms of the thematic word.
Each wordform must obey the restrictions Imposed by thecombination of the feature values displayed on theline which the tutor is writing In.Once the WORD-FORM column of the currentAS completely filled In, the root detection phase isactivated.
The word-forms are ordered lexlco-graphically with the provision that the Initial asso-ciation: ((ci sci Mi Vi) W0 will be remembered.
Inthe general case of a partially regular TF contain-Ing n word-forms the result of the root detectionphase is represented as follows:LA = (((ei...ek)rootO...((em...en) rooU)).The n endings In the above Ilst Inherit the mor-phological features which are associated with theword forms which they were extracted from.
Thatts if the word Wi --- rootJ + ei was associated withpj = (cj scl Mj Vj) then ei would also be associatedwith pj.
As a result, a possible new flexloning para-digm appears: Q = ((el pl)(e2 p2)...(en pn)).
Whilepi are all distinct, this is not obligatory the case forthe endings.
The Q paradigm is looked for In a listof already known paradigms and if not foundthere, is marked for Interning.
To interne a para-digm means to integrate it into an associativestructure (a discrimination tree) appropriate forword-form morphological analysis (see further).With the generation of word forms, the above rep-resentation is very suitable (Tufts,t988).
A para-digm is interned immediately after Its marking onlyif it was learnt from a regular TF.
Otherwise, thisprocess is delayed until the roots of the TF are pro-cessed.
The discrimination tree internally repre-sents  all the known end ings  and the i rmorphological feature values.
Its nodes are la-belled with letters appearing in different endings.A proper ending is represented by the concaten-ation of the letters labelling the nodes along a cer-tain path, starting from a terminal node towardsthe root of the tree.
Due to the retrograde strate-gy used in our system, possible endings which aresearched for In a word from right to the left, arechecked in the discrimination tree from top to bot-tom.
This explains the ordering of the label lettersin the tree.
A terminal node (T-node) Is not obliga-tory a leaf node because of the possibility of Inclu-sion of one ending Into a longer one (the reverseis always true).
All T-nodes are associated with theparadigmatic information specific to the endingwhich they stand for.
This hdormatlon is repre-sented by a list of pairs: ((Q1 pQ(Q2 p2)...(Qm pro))where Qi are paradigm Identifiers and p~ are(identifiers for) points in the paradigmatic flexlo-ning space P. If a T-node (hence an ending) hasassociated more than a single pair (Q p) it Is calledextrinsically ambiguous.
Another type of ambi-guity Is induced by the endings containing shor-ter embedded endings.
We call such endingsintrinsically ambiguous.
Let us suppose two en-dings < X > and < Y ?
so that < X ?
may be writ-ten as <Z><Y>.
In case of a word-form< A ?
< Z ?
< Y ?
without additional informationone cannot definitely decide if the word should be- 147-segmented  as <A> <Z> + <Y>or  as<A> +<Z><Y>.
For both types of ambi-guities there are sound methods of resolution ifthe decision procedure has access to the root lex-icon or to some syntactic rules.Anyway, for Intrinsically ambiguous cases, oursystem has found out that for Romanlan, in almostall cases the segmentation with the longest endingis the correct one.
For extrinsically ambiguous en-dings, the system uses some statistics, extractedfrom the training data, which proved to be valu-able.
For Instance, the system updates for eachparadigm, a so-called local counter with each newthematic family behaving according to that para-digm.
The value of this counter, specific for eachparadigm is considered in sorting the Interpreta-tions of an ending :((Q1 pl)...(Qr pr)).
Accordingto this sorting, an Interpretation (QI pl) is con-sldered more likely than another one (Qi pJ), If Inthe lexicon there are more roots "belonging" to Qithan to Qj.
This preference heuristics does nottake into account the frequency of the words inrunning texts but only their paradigmatic lassifi-cation.
We plan to introduce the "dynamiccounters" which are supposed to provide qualita-tive estimation based on word-forms frequences.It is clear that In order to provide valuable pref-erences, the values of the static/dynamic ountersmust result from large sets of examples and run-ning texts.
This requirement may be fulfilled byusing in parallel many PARADIGM incarnationsand finally by merging their outputs.
It is Import-ant to note that the.preference ~eurlstics we talkabout are intended only for getting a plausabilityordering criterion for the possible interpretationsof an ending or segmentations of an word-form.
Itmeans that no interpretation variant is rejected atthis level, so that if a preferred (according to thepreference heuristics) interpretation or segmenta-tion was wrong, the correct one may still be found.Roots processing and eventually paradigmsmodification or absorbtlon (see further) are basedon some similarity criteria.
If no similarity is de-tected between the roots of a TF, the correspond-Ing paradigm, if marked as new, is Interned as itwas initially constructed.
But if the roots are simi-lar, the system tries to reduce differences betweenthem, either by modifying the inflexlonal paradigmor by inferring rules for root modification.
The firstapproach is generally taken If the differences be-tween roots appear at their boundary with the en-dings.
The second method Is usually tried In caseof differences appearing inside the roots.
The simi-larity criteria are declaratlvely specified, so that ItIs easy to modify, augment or adapt them to spe-cific needs.
The notion of similarity, as used in ourapproach, Is very simple.
We have developed asimilarity description language In which one maydescribe the conditlons under which two stringsare to be considered similar.
With the current ver-sion of the system, we use only three simple simi-larity rules:s l)  <X>?<Y> == <X><Y>s2) <X>I  = <X>?s3) <X>?<Y>I  == <X>?<Y>?In the above rules the metasymbol < X > standsfor an arbitrary string, the question mark for zeroor one letter, the exclamation mark for exactly oneletter and == for the similarity relation.
Their read-ings are:rst) two strings are similar If they differ by atmost one embedded letter (calculatoAr =, calcu-lator);rs2) two strings are similar ff they are the same?
except the last letter of one or both of them (coplL=, cop,);rs3) two strings are similar if they differ by atmost one embedded letter and by the last letter ofone or both of them (fereAstrA == ferestrE).Actually, the similarity description language ismore powerful than it is suggeste~.
For instance,one may impose restrictions on an <X > con-structlon such as minimal or exact number ofcharacters in X, prosodic restrictions such aspresence or absence of accent, a.s.o.
If two rootsare similar, the system attempts to generalize theirsimilarity beyond the particular TF currently pro-cessed.
The simllarlty between two roots isnecessary but not sufficient for making a generali-zation.
What is needed, Is an explanation, In termsof morphological features, accounting for rootmodification.
This explanation, if found, will beused as a precondition for the root modificationrule to be synthesized.
The explanation Justifiesthe difference between the two roots (of the sameTF), and consists of dlscrlminant descriptions (interms of morphological features) of the endingsassociated with them.
In the current version of thesystem, it looks for the morphological featureswhich have the same value for all the word-formsobtainable from the first root and another differentvalue for all word-forms derived from the secondroot.
For instance with the similar roots 'copil' and'copll' (child), the system d~covered that all theforms in singular are produced by the first rootwhile the second generates all the plural forms.- 148 -Using this fact, the system built the following rule,entering only one root (cop,) In the lexicon:"If a root X behaves according to the paradigmQ39 and its last letter Is T then In all plural formsT must be replaced by the letter"T.The "generative" flavour of this rule should notbe misleading: that is, one must not infer that it isgood only for generation.
The same rule appliesto analysis:"If a root was discovered according to the para-digm Q39 and its last letter was T, the root maybe recorded in the lexicon with its T replaced bythe letter T".As more data sets are provided the rules maybe generalized further in order to cover the newcases.We said before that the internalization of amarked paradigm was delayed until the roots of apartial TF were processed.
As we shall see in theexample below, the delay is justified by the possi-bility to alter the initial endings (hence the para-digm) In order to minimize the differencesbetween the considered roots.
A paradigm modi-fication may appear if the last letter from each ofthe roots taken into account is transferred in frontof all their corresponding endings (recall the LAlist in the beginning of this chapter).
If the systemfinds no feature-based Justification for root modi-fication and ff the difference between the roots isgiven by their last letters, it decides to transferthese 'laulty" letters into the appropriate endings,thus "regularizing" the TF.
As a side-effect the In-Itial paradigm is modified and in case the new oneis already known the decision is considered soundand the older paradigm is forgotten.
If the newparadigm is not known to the system then bothparadigms (the initial and the modified ones) arekept until further evidence will allow the system tochoose among them.
If no such evidence is ob-tained in favour of one or another paradigm, it willbe the task of the knowledge base designer to de-cide on the matter.Let us follow on an example the process of learn-ing a root modification rule.
Consider that thetrainer provided the thematic family for the the-matic word "fereastre" (window).
The root detec-t ion process will generate the fo l lowingsegmentations:fereastra + O (0  stands for the null ending)fereastra +ferestre + iferestre + E~ferestre + leferestre + Oferestre + Iorferestre + E~There are identified two roots: 'fereastra' and'ferestre'.
According to the rule s3) they are simi-lar, with < X > and < Y > bound to 'fere' and '$tr'respectively.
The fault letters are associated withtheir appearance context: > e I a I s <, > r I a I and> r I e I.
The notations are interpreted as follows:"> e" = = an 'e' preceded by some other letters;" lal" = = the 'a' fault letter;"s <" = = an's'  followed by some other letters;">r ia l "  = = the final 'a' preceded by 'r';"> r le I" = = the final 'e' preceded by 'r'.The first decision made in order to minimize thedifferences between the two roots is to transfer thelast character of them into endings, thus resultingthe segmentatior,s:fereastr + afereastr + aferestr ?
eiferestr + ?ferestr +eleferestr + eferestr + elorferestr + eA second step towards difference ellimination Isto consider the deletion of the 'a' letter between< fare > and < sir >.
But because this operationdoes not contribute to paradigm modification itmust be generalized (if possible) as a rule for rootmodification.
By Inspecting the morphologicalfeatures of the word-forms, the system finds outthat the root 'fereastr' is characterized by the fea-ture values: feminine, singular and nom-acc, whilethe root 'ferestr' Is characterized in all its appear-ances only by the 'feminine' feature.
Because 'fe-minine' value Is common to all word-forms of thethematic family, it is considered irrelevant with re-spect to roof modification.
Moreover, no word-- 149  -form derivable from the 'ferestr' root has attachedthe "singular + nom-acc" feature values combina-tion.
Therefore, this is taken as a possible condi-t ion for the faulty letter delet ion and thesynthesized rule is the following:RMRt){<X> = >elats<& PARA-D IGM='PO0007 '  & NUMBER='s tngu lar '  &CASE ='nom-acc'} = = > { -~ \[NUMBER = 'sin-gular' & CASE = 'nom-acc'\] = = > >es< )The reading of this rule is: "If a root of a word-form which flexions according to the POD007 para-digm, in singular and nom-acc, contains theembedded string "eas", then for all combinationsof morphological features not containing both sin-gu lar  and nom-acc values, the 'eas' string is re-placed by 'es'".Let us notice that the rule is more specific thanit should be, Imposing that all eligible words be-have according to the P00007 paradigm and re-quiring the letter's' to follow the dlphtong 'ea'.
Butthe system cannot infer more from this singleexample.
If provided with another example, let'ssay 'ceapa' (onion), with a similar behaviour thesystem synthesizes a rule very alike to RMRI:RMR2){<X> = >e la lp<& PARA-D IGM='P00007 '  & NUMBER= 's ingular '  &CASE ='nom-acc'} = = > { ~ \[NUMBER = 'sin-gular' & CASE ='nom-acc'\] = = > >ep< }The only difference between RMR1 and RMR2is the condition that the diphtong 'ea' must be fol-lowed by 's' and 'p' respectively.
By consideringthis condition a particular one, the system dropsit and obtains a more general rule subsuming bothprevious ones:RMR3){<X> = >e la l<& PARA-D IGM='P00007 '  & NUMBER='s lngu ler '  &CASE ='nom-acc'} = = > {-~ \[NUMBER = 'sin-gular' & CASE = 'nom-acc'\] = = > >e< }The rule RMR3 is still too specific.
The process-Ing of the thematic family for the word 'sears' (eve-ning) produces a further generalization of RMR3.Firstly, the system generates the following rule:RMR4){<X> = >e ls l<& PARA-D IGM='P00008 '  & NUMBER= 's ingular '  &CASE = 'nom-acc'} = = > {-- \[NUMBER = 'sin-gular' & CASE = 'nom-acc'\] = = > > ?
< }The difference between RMR3 and RMR4 ismade by the restriction that the flexioning para-digms are required to be P00007 Instead ofP00008.
To generalize these rules, the system in-vestigates the feature values of the two Involvedparadigms.
Their  common propert ies  areSC =COMMON-NOUN, GENDER = FEMININE,so the system is able to propose a new rule sub-suming the RMR3 and RMR4 rules:RMRS){<X> = >s ia l  < &SUB-CA-TEGORY ='common-noun'  & GENDER = 'fe-min ine '  & NUMBER = ' s ingu lar '  &CASE ='nom-acc'} = = > {- ,  \[NUMBER = 'sin-gular' & CASE ='nom-acc'\] = = > >es< }Because generalization correctness over incom-plete data cannot be guaranteed, each syn-thesized rule has two associated lists, one of themcontaining positive examples (Initially only theprototype root which generated the rule) and theother one containing exceptions (initially empty).A similar point of view, that is attaching exceptionlists to general rules, may be found in (Bear,1988).The roots are entered into the root lexicon.
Forpartial regular thematic families, the two or moreroots are linked together bidirectionally.
The firstof them, in lexicographic order, is attached to therelevant common morpho-lexical information:paradigm name end the label for the semantic de-scription.
This information is Inherited by all linkedroots.
There is also root specific morphological In-formation such as selectional restrictions andphonemic patterns.
The selectional restrictionsare contributed by the system and they refer tothe constraints to be satisfied In order that a rootbe selected in a word-form generation.
For theregular modifying roots, links to the rules theyobey and the position(s) In the root where letterInsertion or deletion Is to be performed are alsorecorded In this field.The lexicon building side-effect of the tutorialsessions Is not the main Interest of the researchreported here (for this purpose we developed theMORPHO lex icon  management  sys tem(Tufts, 1987a)).This feature was Implemented onlyfor testing the PARADIGM system in learning andusing learnt knowledge.
Also, we were Interestedin experimenting some generetlon strategies atthe level of morphology (for instance choosing theleast ambiguous or the more common used rootfrom a synonimy set - see (Tufis,1988)).
it waspossible, in this way, to test the functionality ofPARADIGM without coupling it to MORPHO, oper-ation which would have required a greater pro-gramming effort.
The embedding of PARADIGMinto MORPHO is planned for the Immediate future.- 150  -At the end of the system's apprenticeship Is ac-tivated a processing phase which we call the para-dlgmatic absorbtlon.
A paradigm Q1 may beabsorbed Into another paradigm Q2 iff:abl) they describe the same subcategory,ab2) for each ending 'eli' from Q1 and the corre-sponding ending 'ea' from Q2 the following aretrue:'eli' is a suffix of 'e21': < e2i > : < x > < eti > andthe < x > preffix in 'e2i' exists as a suffix in all theroots In the lexicon which, from the flexlonlngpoint of view, behave according to QI.The implementation of paradigms absorbtlon Iscomputatlonally motivated: firstly by decreasingthe number of paradigms, the search space Is nar-rowed and consequently word-form processingtime Improved; secondly, by lengthening the en-dings, they become more discriminating andtherefore the ambiguity Is reduced.
In Romanlanthe case Is that the longer an ending, the less am-biguous Its Interpretation.
For instance the 'i' en-ding has 19 possible Interpretations (in ourmodel), while the ending 'ulul' has only one.
Wethink that this is a general property with inflexlo-nal languages and therefore we consider paradig-matic absorbtion not to be specific for Romanlan.The paradigmatic absorbtion limits both typesof ambiguity discussed eadler: Intrinsically (dueto different possibilities of a word segmentation)and extrinsically (due to different Interpretationsan ending may have).In order to obtain a complete morphologicalknowledge in a relatively short time, PARADIGMis accompanied by a merging utility program,(partially) able to unify two or more knowledgebases developed with different copies of the sys-tem.5.
FINAL REMARKSOne of our eadler goals, some years ago, wasto establish, by manual procedures, a reasonableset of flexionlng paradigms for Romanlan, In orderto implement a reliable morphological processor,general enough to cover the requirements of tech-nical texts.
The task was taken by seven col-leagues with different backgrounds (linguists,logicians, engineers and mathematicians ) andlasted for almost half an year (Crlstea,1982).
Iused the examples from the then written material,in order to test the PARADIGM system.
While dif-ferently organized, the equivalent (in linguisticcoverage) knowledge base was obtained in a four-hour session.
Moreover, the number of paradigmsdiscovered by PARADIGM was smaller (97 para-digms versus 123).
The rest were absorbed with-out any loss.
By rul~ning test data on the manuallydiscovered knowledge base and on the PARA-DIGM acquired knowledge base we noted up to10% improvement in analysis time.
In hypothesis-Ing the lexical status and morphological featuresof the unknown words, based only on endingsanalysis, the PARADIGM generated knowledgebase was also batter.A morphological knowledge base for Russianand another one for Spanish are under develop-ment.
Experiments have also been made withFrench, Slovak and Hungarian.
In the near future,we plan to develop the system in two Important di-rections:- learning compound word-forms rules (procUticarticulation of nouns and adjectives, verb com-pound tenses, degrees of comparison for adjec-tives);- learning lexical affixes (that is meaning mod-ifying preffixes and suffixes (Tufts,1988)).Related work is reported in (Wohtke, t986),(Trost,1986) but they are either concerned withEnglish (not a very exciting language from themorphological point of view) or address gener-ation or analysis only.
The very popular two-levelmorphology model of Koskennlemi (1983) in-tended primarily to derivatlonal morphology is,from our point of view, too expensive for a gram-matlcal oriented processing.Recent work reported in (Goertz, 1988), (Woth-ks', 1986), (Zock, 1988) share some points with ourapproach.We consider that the main contributions of ourwork stem from the following features:- freedom In defining the categorlal system forthe model;- Independence of a specific natural language,provided it is within our "root + ending" approach;- applicability of the synthesized rules both Inanalysing and generating word forms;- possibility of rapid development of morphologi-cal knowledge bases, by merging the results ofmany parallel acquisition sessions;~__~ - 151  -- duality of system behaviour (apprentice - ex-pert) which allows Immediate check of the ac-quired knowledge;- low level of linguistic competence required tothe trainers.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe main part of the PARADIGM system, initiallyimplemented in TC-LISP (Tufls,1987b) for PDP1 l-like computers, was transferred on IBM-PC underGCLISP, during a reseach stay at the InternationalBasic Laboratory on Artificial Intelligence of the In-stitute of Technical Cybernetics of the SlovakAcademy of Sciences In Bratlslava.
