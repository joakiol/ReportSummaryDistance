IMPLEMENTING THE GENERALIZED WORD ORDER GRAMMARS OFCHOMSKY AND DIDERICHSENby Bengt Sigurd, Dept of Linguistics, Lund University, SWEDENHelgonabacken 12, S-223 62 Lund, e- mail: linglund@gemini.ldc.lu.seMany of the insights of TransformationalGrammar (TG) concern the movability ofconstituents.
But in recent versions(Government & Binding, GB; cf.
Chomsky,1982, Sells,1985) the sentence representations(trees) include both the site of the movedconstituent and the site from where it has beenmoved; the original site of the movedconstituent is marked as a trace (t) or empty (e,\[\]).
In the sentence schema (Field or PositionGrammar) developed by the Danish linguistPaul Diderichsen (1946), there are alsopositions both for the new and the old site ofmoved constituents.
Thus Diderichsenobserves that an adverb could introduce or bethe fundament of a sentence, in which case thesubject np "remains" in its "normal" positionafter the finite verb (Swedish example: ldagkom pojken; literally: Today came the boy).
Ifthe subject np introduces the sentence (Pojkenkom idag) its "original" place after the finiteverb must be empty (For comparisons betweenTransformational Grammar and Diderichsen'sgrammar, cf.
Teleman, 1972, Platzack,1986).Underlying both Chomskyan GBgrammar and Diderichsen's Field Grammar isa grammatical system which consists of ageneral word or constituent order schemasupplemented with co-occurrence r strictions.This type of system may be called GeneralizedWord Order Grammar (GWOG), and thispaper deals with ways of implementing such asystem on the computer using Definite ClauseGrammar (DCG;Clocksin & Mellish, 1981), aformalism available in most Prolog versions.Definite Clause Grammar is aconvenient rewriting system with an arrow(-->) familiar to generative linguists.
It allowsone to state the maximum sequence ofconstituents (the order schema) to the right ofthe arrow.
A setup of constraining conditionscan then be used to prohibit overgeneration.Such restrictions are stated within curlybrackets in the Definite Clause Grammarformalism.
Constraining conditions mayrequire that certain slots be filled or empty,that a certain variable have a certain value, thatcertain constituents cannot occur at the sametime (co-occurrence r strictions), etc.In addition one may have furtherconditions which state that a certain constituentis to have a certain functional role, e.g.
be thesubject or the object of the sentence.
Suchconditions may be called functional roleconditions (f-conditions) as they build afunctional structure (f-representation).
Thisstructure may be built in a certain slot (as anadditional argument) to the left of the arrow.Further conditions may concern the topic(focus), mode, clause type, lacking constituent,etc.
of the sentence, and this information mayalso be gathered as arguments in slots to the leftof the arrow.The system to be presented in this paperalso incorporates many of the ideas of ReferentGrammar (RG; Sigurd, 1987), a :functionalgeneralized phrase structure grammar used inthe automatic translation project Swetra (Sigurd& Gawronska-Werngren, 1988).
I herebyacknowledge the help of Mats Eeg-Olofsson,\] 336Barbara Gawronska-Werngren and Per Warterin the Swetra group at Lund.The genera l ized word  order schemas ofChomsky  and Dider ichsenAs can be seen from articles and text-books(e.g.
Sells,1985), a typical ChomskyanGovernment & Binding representation is ahighbinary hierarchical tree with complementizerphrases (C-phrases) on top of I(nfl)- and V-phrases.
A tree for the Swedish sentence: "Vemslog pojken?"
(Literally: Whom hit the boy?
)given here in a parenthesis notation might lookas follows, assuming "pojken" ("the boy") tobe the subject:CP(XP(vem:i),C'(C(slog:j),IP(NP(pojken:k),I'(I,VP(NP(e:k),V'(V(e:j),NP(e:i)))))))"Whom hit the boy"This simplified representation means that theobject "vem" is found in a front slot called"XP", the finite verb is found in the slot called"C(omplement)" and the subject "pojken" isfound in the "specifier" slot under IP.
The"spec" under "VP" is empty and so are the verbslot under V' and the NP slot under V'.The transformational (process)description would, say that "vem" ("whom")has been moved from its final position leavinga trace indexed with the same number (e:i) forreference.
Similarly the transformationaldescription would say that the finite verb "slog"and ',pojken" have left coindexed traces (e:j,e:k) behind.
The Swedish sentence: "Vemslog pojken" is ambiguous and could also beinterpreted as "Who hit the boy".
In that casethe question pronoun "vem" (now equivalent toEnglish "who") should be coindexed with atrace in the position where "pojken" was foundin the first case and "pojken" should be foundin the "object position" under V'.Diderichsen uses a simpler model - hedid his work long before Chomsky whenformal grammar was not as highly developed.He would have stated the facts in the followingway:Fund v s a V S AVem slog pojken - - -Vem slog - pojken-For the first interpretation f the sentence the"object slot" S(ubstantive=nominal) is empty;for the second interpretation the subject slots(ubstantive) is empty - besides the empty slotsfor sentence adverbs (a), non-finite verbs (V)and other adverbs (A) also marked by theminus sign (-).
Diderichsen calls the first threeslots "the nexus field" and the last three "thecontent field" (indholdsfeltet).
This divisionsuits sentences containing an auxiliary withinfinitives or participles, but for othersentences the division between a nexus fieldand a content field is unfortunate.
The objects(in S) get separated from the finite verb (v) insimple transitive sentences.
In the model to bepresented below infinitives and participles aretreated as subordinate (minor) clauses withtheir own objects and adverbs.GWOG rules .
a s imple i l lustrationThe following (simplified) Prolog (DefiniteClause Grammar) rules illustrate how exampleslike those mentioned in the introduction can behandled by Generalized Word Order Grammarrules.2 337sent(M,T,s(subj(Subj),pred(Pred),advl(Advl)))-->fund(Fund),vi(V),np(Np2),adv(Adv2),{Fund=np(_),Np2=\[\],Subj=Fund,Pred=V,Advl=Adv2,T=Fund,M=d;/*Subj+Verb+Adverb:Pojken om idag*/(Fund=adv(_),Np2\=\[l,Subj=Np2,Fh'ed=V,Advl=Fund,T=Fund,M=d }./*Adverb+Verb+Subj:Idag kom pojken*/This basic rule is a rewriting rule.
It states thatwe get the information in the argument slotsafter "sent" if we find the (phrase or word)categories to the right of the arrow in the orderthey are given.
Further phrase and word(lexical) rules defining an adverb (adv), an np,and an intransitive verb (vi), e.g.
as describedin Sigurd(1987) are needed.
The lexical rulesneeded in order to generate our examples canhave the fol lowing simplif ied form:np(np(pojken)) --> \[pojken\].
np(\[\]) --> \[\].vi(kom) --> \[kom\].
adv(adv(idag)) --> \[idag\].adv(\[\]) --> \[\].
The categories np and adv maybe empty (\[\]).
The verb is obligatory.Diderichsen's "fundament" ("fund") is aninitial position unspecified as a syntacticcategory.
Both an np and an adverb mayoccur as fundament in our simple example, sothe following two fundament rules are thereforeneedeA:fund(F) --> np(F)./* an np is fundament */fund(F)--> adv(F)./* an adv is fundament */As can be seen, the schema would beovergenerating if no co-occurrence r strictionswere introduced.
Such restrictions orconditions are written within curly brackets({ }) in Definite Clause Grammar, and theystate which conditions are to hold on thevariables specified.
(Variables begin withcapital letters in Prolog.
)Two alternatives are shown withexamples.
The first alternative occurs if thefundament is an np: np(_,\[Fund\],\[\]).
In thatcase no second np (Np2) can be found after theintransitive finite verb.
(This is our way ofstating that an np has been fronted).
In additionto the co-occurrence restrictions, the samplerules illustrate how information aboutfunctional roles and topic is stated.
In the firstcase the fundament (Fund) is assigned thefunctional role of subject.
The value of thefundament is also assigned to the Topicvariable (T).In the second alternative, given aftersemicolon (;), an adverb is the fundament:adv(_,\[Fund\],\[\]).
Then there must be an Np2(Np2 cannot be empty: Np2\= \[\]).
In that casethe subject is assigned the value (Np2) and theadverb (Fund) is the topic of the sentence.
Thevalue of tile adverb (Fund) is also assigned tothe adverbial (Advl) of the functionalrepresentation.
In both cases the Pred isassigned the value (V) of the verb, and in bothcases the mode of the sentence is declarative,why M(ode) is set at d(eclarative).
The twoexamples would both receive the followingfunctional representation:s(subj (pojken),pred(kom),advl(idag)).This functional representation agrees with thestandard format of Referent Grammar used inmachine translation.
The order in an RGfunctional representation is fixed: subject,predicate, dative obj, direct object, sentenceadverbials, other adverbials.As can be seen there are slots for Mode,Topic and Functional representation with"sent".
The output of the parsing of a sentence3 338is information about mode, topic and thefunctional representation.
I  more advancedand extensive rules, information about clausetype and defectiveness (in order to handle thepercolation of missing constituents) is alsogathered in additional slots with "sent".A generalized word order schema forSwedishGeneralizing from the word and constituentorders found in Swedish one may suggest hefollowing basic rule for main clauses:sent(M,C1 type ,Defect,T,F repr) -->fund(Fund), idag \[\] pojkenv(V), kom gav lovadesadv(Sadv2), intenp(Np2), pojken pojken flickansadv(Sadv3), intenp(Np3), flickanprediv(Prediv),np(Np4), hundensunt(Sunt), att g~iadv(Adv2), idagThe Swedish examples to the right show howslots may be filled differently: "Idag kom intepojken" (Literally: Today came not the boy),"Gay pojken inte flickan hunden idag?
"Literally: Gave the boy not the girl the dogtoday?
),"Pojken lovade flickan att gfi"(Literally: The boy promised the girl to go).
"Sunt" is the category containing subordinateclauses and minor (infinitive or participial)clauses.Compared to Diderichsen's model thereis a longer sequence of categories, and non-finite verbs are treated as subordinate clauses.Chomsky and his followers try to definefunctional roles configurationally, but ourapproach is rather a formalization ofDiderichsen's verbal descriptions.
Thefunctional representation is built as a list in themore advanced versions, but we will not gointo such technical details here.The following are further illustrationsof the conditions needed:{ Fund=\[\],vtt(V),Np2\=\[\] ,Np3X=\[\] ,Np4X=\[\],subj(Np2),dobj (Np3),obj =Np4,M=q;/* gay pojken flickan hunden?
*/Fund=np(_),vd(V),Np2\=\[\],Np3=\[\],Np4=\[\],Sunt~=\[\],subj(Fund),dobj(Np2),obj(Sunt),M--d}./* pojken lovade flickan att gft */The first condition states that if there is nothing(Fund=\[\]) before a doubly transitive finite verb(vtt), the mode must be "q(uestion)" and thenoun phrases are assigned the roles: subject,dative object (dobj) and direct object (obj) inthat order.
This covers our example "Gaypojken (inte) flickan hunden idag?"
(Literally:Gave the boy (not) the girl the dog today?
").The second alternative (after ;) shows the caseof "verba dicendi" (vd) as in "Pojken lovadeflickan att ggt" (Literally: The boy promised thegirl to go).
In that case the first noun phraseafter the finite verb (Np2) is taken as a dativeobject and the infinitive clause represented by"Sunt" as the direct object.Discussion and conclusionIt is clear that there is a trade-off between theextension (generality) of the order schema ndthe co-occurrence r strictions.
A very generalschema requires many constraining restrictions,several simpler schemas require fewerrestrictions, but the overall system growsbigger.
Chomsky and his followers seem toprefer to use one schema to cover all types ofclauses in order to catch as manygeneralizations a possible.
The node name4 339"comp(lementizer)" clearly stems fromsubordinate clauses, but it has been generalizedto all sentences in GB.
Diderichsen used onegeneral schema for all types of main sentences,but a separate schema for subordinate clauses.For a general discussion of the potential ofpositional systems in syntax, morphology andphonology see Brodda & Karlgren, 1964.Some of our restrictions and constraintson the value of certain variables and co-occurrence of constituents, etc.
can be relatedto the constraining principles and filters used inGB.Swedish subordinate clauses differfrom main clauses by having the sentenceadverbs before the finite verb, and generallysubordinate clauses are characterized byinitialcomplementizers, uch as subjunctions,infinitive markers o1" relative pronouns.
In thecurrent implementation subordinate clauses aretreated by separate rules.
In Swedish, almostall information about clause type, topic, andmode is to be found in the positions before thefinite verb.It is clear that the GWOG model suitsthe Nordic and Germanic languages well withtheir finite verb second and fairly fixed wordorder, but not languages with fairly free wordorder (e.g Slavic languages) where the schemamust allow for almost any combination of thewords.The program illustrated works nicelyfor' analysis, but when used for synthesis(generation) further conditions are needed andthe components have to be rearrangedsomewhat.
The program may be considered asan alternative to Pereira's Extrapositiongrammar (1981).ReferencesB.
