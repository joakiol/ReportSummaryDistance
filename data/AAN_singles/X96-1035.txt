ADVANCES IN MULTILINGUAL TEXT RETRIEVALMark DavisComputing Research LabNew Mexico State UniversityBox 30001/3CRLLas Cruces, NM 88003madavis @ crl.nmsu, edu(505) 646-1148INTRODUCTIONMultilingual text retrieval extends the basic mono-lingual detection task to include retrieving relevant doc-uments in languages other than the query language.
Thetask therefore merges efforts in machine translation withefforts in text retrieval, but the machine translation com-ponent may be substantially simplified due to somebasic assumptions about he design and implementationof high-performance text retrieval systems.
A primaryconsideration is that most modem text retrieval systemsregard queries and documents as unordered "bags" ofwords.
The translation of an unordered set of terms istherefore approximately the translation of the termsthemselves.
Although a linearity assumption such as thisbreaks down when considering phrasal elements in mostlanguages, it is reasonably accurate for many terms andbecomes increasingly accurate at the sentence l vel andabove.A second consideration i  multilingual text retrievalis where the translation is done.
It is possible to translateevery document at index time, for example, but theresource costs are substantially higher than translatingthe query at retrieval time.
An added benefit of translat-ing only the query is that queries can be prepared withno special weighting scheme applied to the terms.
Thequeries are then available to any natural anguage textretrieval system.The range of translation techniques that are avail-able to a query translation system is greater than in stan-dard machine translation systems.
Previously translateddocument corpora can be made available for exploitingdomain-specific terminology by direct comparison ofthe retrieval results for the query and target documentlanguages.
No special heuristics are needed for usingthis "example-based" translation approach; the querycan be optimized by adding or deleting terms until thetarget language retrieval results are approximately thesame as the source language retrieval results.
Lexical-transfer techniques can also be used in the same context,providing wide coverage of term senses.CRL evaluated five methods for query translation iTipster II.
The results were then evaluated in TREC byhand-translating the TREC Spanish monolingual que-ries into English and applying the automatic querytranslation methods to produce new Spanish queries.Ongoing work is focusing on improving the perfor-mance of query translation techniques while expandingthe techniques to work with new languages and searchengines, including WWW search services.MLTR IN  TRECStarting with TREC- 3, Spanish corpora nd querysets have been available for evaluating text retrievalengines.
The queries and corpus are monolingual, how-ever, so testing a multilingual system is only possible ifthe query set or the corpus is translated into a differentlanguage.
We chose to translate the queries since theywere very short.
With translated queries, aquery transla-tion system that produces Spanish queries from hand-translated English versions of original Spanish queriescan then be compared against he original queries.
Thedifferences between the two results are then a reason-able measure of the effectiveness of the translation pro-cess in preserving the characteristics of the originalquery that contribute to retrieval.
Several of the SpanishTREC queries and their hand-translated versions areshown in Table 1, below.The query translation methods that we applied toproduce new Spanish queries were of two major types:methods that used a prepared lexicon and methods thatused a parallel training corpus.
While a lexicon tends toproduce translations that are shallow but comprehen-sive, covering all possible senses of a term but limited inthe range of synonyms that are produced for each term,corpus methods tend to produce translations that aredeep but narrow, with enormous repetition of domain-related senses of terminology.
This justified an examina-tion of the comparative merits of both approaches.As is often the case, our parallel corpus was notprecisely of the same domain as the TREC document185collection for the ultimate valuation.
The corpus itselfwas extremely large, however, which we hoped wouldoffset the difficulties of using a distinctly different ypeof text.
The corpus was 1.6 Gb of Spanish and Englishtranslations from the United Nations, containing pro-ceedings of meetings, policy documents and notes onUN activities in member countries.
The documents wereautomatically aligned \[1\] at the sentence level using aprocedure that is conservatively estimated to have an83% accuracy over grossly noisy document pairs (whichthe UN documents were not).
This produced a parallelcorpus of around 680,000 aligned sentence pairs.Lexical TransferThe first method was to perform term-by-termtranslation with the Collins English-Spanish bilingualdictionary.
Individual terms in the English query werereduced to their morphological roots and lookup wasperformed.
The resulting set of Spanish terms becamethe Spanish query.
Some repetition of terms is apparentin the resulting queries because all senses of each termwere used with no attempt to disambiguate he contex-tual usage of the English terms.
For example, Query 28is transformed fromIndicators of economic and businessrelations between Mexico and Asiancountries, such as Japan, China andKorea.toindicador indicador ayuda expansi6nprevis iones crecimiento comercio com-ercio narraci6n relaci6n parentescoM4xico Ciudad gripe patr ia camporegidn amor semejante parecido tantoel laca China Mar t4 porcelana vitr inacoal ln Corea Corea Corea mexicana mex-icano M~xicoNote that "China" has been replaced with both"China" and "porcelana" as a result of this simple lexi-cal substitution scheme, and that "relations" hasincluded the familial sense "parentesco".
Lexicon-gen-erated Spanish QueriesThe lexical-transfer approach produced Spanishqueries rapidly, requiring only a simple database lookupprocedure.
This process is shown in Figure 1 (a).High-Frequency Terms from Parallel TextIn text, the terms that occur with the highest fre-quency are rarely of statistical significance, and aremore often than not merely redundant.
Yet the terms thatoccur with moderate frequency are sometimes ignifi-cant.
In order to evaluate other corpus-based methods,we wanted to establish a baseline for queries formedfrom these moderate frequency term sets.
Using a vec-tor-based text retrieval system with no term spreading orother modifications, the English queries were translatedby performing a lookup on the English side of the paral-lel corpus, collecting the Spanish sentences that wereparallels to the top 100 retrieved ocuments, filtering theremaining terms to eliminate the top 500 most frequentSpanish terms, and collecting the next 100 most fre-quent Spanish terms to create the new query.
This pro-cess is shown in Figure 1 (b):Several of the resulting queries are given in Table 2.Some formatting codes from the UN documents havebeen eliminated in some of the queries, reducing thecount to below 100 terms in those queries.
For brevity,only the first two queries are shown in Table 2.Statistically Significant TermsWhereas the high-frequency terms extracted in theprevious method provide a baseline for examiningimproved methods, high-frequency terms are them-selves not necessarily the best terms for discriminatingthe significant features involved in text retrieval.
A bet-ter approach is to extract he terms which are statisti-cally significant in the retrieved segments of parallel textin comparison to the corpus as a whole.
Various meth-ods are possible for testing statistical significance, butthe method we applied is based on a log-likelihood ratiotest that assumes a X 2 distribution is an accurate modelof the term distributions in text \[2\].The method begins by extracting all of the termsfrom the sentences that are parallels to the top 100retrieved English sentences.
The counts of the pooledterms are then compared with the counts for the entireUN training corpus to evaluate their statistical signifi-cance.
The top 100 most-significant terms are thenextracted and become the new Spanish query.
Figure 1(c) diagrams the process.
The resulting queries are inTable 3, below.sEvolutionary Optimization of QueriesIf we could make a set of derived Spanish queriesretrieve documents in a manner that is similar to theEnglish queries over a training corpus, then the Spanishquery could conceivably produce similar results on anovel corpus.
One way to change Spanish queries is toadd and remove terms.
The number of possible uniquedeletions that can be performed on a 70 word query is186quite large, however, making the direct examination ofall possible modified queries effectively impossible.We applied an evolutionary programming (EP) \[3\]approach to modify a population of 50 queries.
In an EPapproach, an initial population of queries is neededalong with a mutation strategy to modify queries.
Opti-mization then proceeds by evaluating the comparativefitnesses of the queries, mutating a selected sub-popula-tion of the queries to produce "offspring" solutions andre-evaluating the queries iteratively until a suitable num-ber of generations have passed.
Our EP approach con-sidered the comparative evaluation of document scorevectors as an objective measure of the relative fitness ofa query to the collection.
This process is diagrammed inFigure 1 (d).The initial queries for this test were the queriesfrom the high-frequency lookup strategy discussedabove.
Previously, we have used a lexicon to generateinitial queries \[4\].
The mutation strategy appliedbetween one and ten modification operations to each ofthe 50 queries per generation and collected only the best10% of the queries to propagate into the next generation.Optimization proceeded for 50 generations, resulting ina wide range of changes to each query.The types of queries produced by this system typi-cally showed the repetition of key terminology com-bined with the elimination of irrelevant erms.
Thefitness judgment for a query was based on comparativeretrieval results using a training corpus of only 80,000aligned sentences.
Table 4, below, shows two of theresulting queries from the EP method.Singular Value Decomposition and theTranslation MatrixThe final query translation method was a radicaldeparture from the others, but is derived from earlierwork by \[5\] and \[6\].
This method is at heart a numericalapproach to derive a translation matrix from paralleltexts.In this effort, we applied a QR-decomposition tech-nique to reduce the complexity of calculating the singu-lar value decomposition, resulting in query translationthat took only a matter of seconds on a SPARC 10.
Sev-eral of the generated queries are given in Table 6.
Fig-ure 1 (e) diagrams the process.OVERVIEW OF RESULTSThe resulting queries were given to University ofMassachusetts, Amherst, who ran them against theSpanish TREC document collection using SpanishInquery.
The original Spanish TREC queries were alsoevaluated to establish a reference baseline.
The resultswere as follows:1.
On average, the dictionary-based queries producedperformance which was about 50% worse than thereference queries.2.
The EP-derived queries produced performancewhich was 60-70% worse than the reference que-ries, except at higher ecall evels (.6-1.0), at whichthey performed better than the Method 1 queries.3.
The other methods performed even more poorly.4.
On at least wo queries, performance of the lexicalmethods was as good or better than the referencequeries.5.
On two queries, performance of the EP approachwas as good as the reference queries, although theytended to have better precision at higher ecall.These modest results demonstrate hat lexical andcorpus methods can be applied to query translation i  alarge-scale multilingual text retrieval scenario, althoughat a fair penalty in performance.
Each of these methodswas purposely limited to as simple a scheme as possible,however, so there is plenty of room for improvementand further experimentation.The average precision-recall curve for all 25 queries is shown in Figure 2.RECENT AND ONGOING WORKCurrent work is focusing on improving the perfor-mance of MLTR methods, applying the methods to newlanguages and making use of new retrieval engines.An example of the latter is shown in Figure 3.
Mun-dial is a query interface to Infoseek and Yahoo that takesqueries in English, translates them to Spanish and sub-mits the resulting queries to the Infoseek and Yahoosearch engines directly.
Figure 4 shows the completedsearch for Spanish documents on Infoseek.
The Mundialdemo uses a bilingual dictionary combined with severalheuristics to limit the terminological expansion of theinput query.
Limiting query size is important becausemost search engines, like Infoseek, restrict he size of aquery to around 80 characters.
Overgeneration i  thetranslation process is handled by using the longest erms(in character count) in Mundial.
Although in some casesthis may be in error, the hope is that automatic stem-ming of query terms at the search engine will reducelong terms to stems common to many of the keywordsthat might have been substituted if the entire definitionwas transferred.
The second motivation was that long187terms tend to be more precise than short terms, and con-tent words should be as precise as possible.Mundial may be accessed at:http://crl.nmsu.edu/ANG/ML/ml.html.REFERENCES[1] Davis, M.
