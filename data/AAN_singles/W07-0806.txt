The system supports simplemedical diagnosis questions about head-aches using vocabulary of 322 words.
Weshow that the MedSLT architecture basedon motivated general grammars producesvery good results, with a limited effort.Based on the grammars for other languagescovered by the system, it is in fact veryeasy to develop an Arabic grammar and tospecialize it efficiently for the differentsystem tasks.
In this paper, we focus ongeneration.1 IntroductionMedSLT is a medical speech translation system.
Itallows a doctor to ask diagnosis questions in medi-cal subdomains, such as headaches, abdominalpain, etc, covering a wide range of questions thatdoctors generally ask their patients.
The grammar-based architecture, built using specialization fromreusable general grammars, is designed to allow arapid development of different domains and lan-guages.
Presently, it supports English, French,Japanese, Spanish and Catalan.
This article focuseson the system development for Arabic.In general, translation in this context raises twospecific questions: 1) how to achieve recognitionquality that is good enough for translation, and 2)how to get translations to be as idiomatic as possi-ble so they can be understood by the patient.
Forclose languages and domains where accuracy is notvery important (e.g.
information requests), it maybe possible to combine a statistical recognizer witha commercial translation system as it is often donein commercial tools such as SpokenTranslation(Seligman and Dillinger, 2006).
However, for thisspecific application in a multilingual context, thissolution is not applicable at all: even if perfect rec-ognition were possible (which is far from being thecase), current commercial tools for translating toArabic do not guarantee good quality.
The domaindealt with here contains, in fact, many structuresspecific to this type of oral dialogue that can not behandled by these systems.
For example, all thedoctor?s interactions with the MedSLT systemconsist of questions whose structures differ fromone language to another, with each language hav-ing its own constraints.
Consequently, two types oferrors occur in Arabic translation systems.
Eitherthey do not recognize the interrogative structure asin example (1), or they produce ungrammaticalsentences by copying the original structure as inexample (2):41(1) was the pain severe??

In example 3, the context isneeded to guarantee adjective agreement.

(muhtamala, muhtamalan, muhta-mal)?moderate_fem_attributive_adj,moderate_vocalized-predicative_adj,moderate_attributive_adj?.It is also essential for rules of translation to beapplied consistently.
For instance, in MedSLT,onset is translated by the verb -7 (dhahara).
Inthis context, the adjective sudden has to be trans-lated by an adverb 9?, (fajatan) (example 4).
Thisimplies that the translation of the ellipsis in thesecond utterance needs to change syntactic cate-gory too.
We can wonder to what extent the word-for-word translation of the elliptical sentence in (4)can be understood by the patient.4)  Doctor: was the onset of headaches sud-den?Trad:   9??;?
?7- ?, ?
(MedSLT)(hal dhahara al sudaa fajatan?
)(Q appear-past-3 the headache suddenly?
)Doctor: acute?Trad: <=5?(mufaji?
)(acute)In addition to that ellipsis can not always betranslated by the same type of ellipsis.
Arabicgrammar (Amin, 1982) allows the use of ellipticalstructures in cases where there is a semantic link( -!> ) referring to the omitted part of the sentenceotherwise the elliptical construction is ambiguous.In example (3), the use of an adjective alone pre-sents an ambiguity introducing, therefore, a diffi-culty in comprehension which can be problematic.Thus, it is necessary to resort to a more sophisti-cated approach.
We will describe, in the followingpart, the architecture on which MedSLT is based.Then, we will show how it has been adapted toArabic.2 The ArchitectureMedSLT is a grammar-based medical speech trans-lation system which uses the commercial Nuancespeech recognition platform.
It has two main fea-tures (Bouillon et al, 2005).
First, all the languagemodels (for recognition, analysis, generation) areproduced from linguistically motivated, generalunification grammars using the Regulus platform(Rayner, et al, 2006).
First, domain specific unifi-cation grammars are created from the generalgrammar for the different domains of medical di-agnosis through a trainable corpus-based automaticgrammar specialization process.
They are, next,compiled into Context Free Grammars (CFGs) in aformat suitable for use with the Nuance speech42recognition platform, and into a form needed for avariant of Semantic Head-driven generation (Shie-ber et al, 1990).
Therefore, the different grammarsneeded by the system under this approach are easyto build and maintain.This leads us to the second feature.
Becausegrammar-based speech recognition only producescompetitive results for the sentences covered bythe grammar, the user will need to learn the cover-age of the system.
In order to assist in this, a helpsystem is included in the system (Starlander et al,2005 and Chatzichrisafis et al, 2006).
The helpsystem suggests, after each user utterance, similarutterances covered by the grammar which can betaken as a model.
In order to derive the help sen-tences, the system performs, in parallel, a statisticalrecognition of the input speech.
It then comparesthe recognition result using an N-gram based met-ric, against a set of known correct in-coveragequestions to extract the most similar ones.
It is inthat way that we introduce some of the robustnessof the statistical systems in the controlled applica-tion.Once the sentence recognized, the translation isinterlingua-based.
Regulus allows different typesof source representations (Rayner, et al, 2006), butwe have chosen to use the simplest one in order tofacilitate the translation process.
It is a flat seman-tic structure built up by concatenation of wordmeanings.
For instance, ? $ ?;??
< ??2+?
(halyachtaddou al soudaa inda al qalaq?
?Q aggra-vate-3 the headache in the stress?)
would be repre-sented as follows:[[cause,qalaq],[event,yachtaddou],[prep_cause,inda],[symptom,soudaa],[tense,present],[utterance_type,ynq],[voice,active]]The same formalism is used for the interlinguawhich is a standardized version of the most explicitsource English representation.
For example, theinterlingua representation of the previous sentencecorresponds to the following structure that can beparaphrased as follows: ?
does the pain becomeworse when you experience anxiety??
:[[sc,when],[clause,[[pronoun,you],[secondary_symptom,anxiety],[state,experience],[tense,present],[utterance_type,dcl],[voice,active]]],[event,become_worse],[symtom,headache],[tense,present],[utterance_type,ynq],[voice,active]].Under this approach the translation process onlyinvolves mapping simple structures.
This facilitatesthe process of translation and the resolution of di-vergences.
This process goes through five stages:1) source language analysis in order to extractsource representation; 2) ellipsis resolution if nec-essary; 3) mapping the source structure into theinterlingua; 4) mapping the interlingua into thetarget structure and 5) generation of the target lan-guage in accordance with its own grammar.We will show next the adequacy of this architec-ture for translation in Arabic.
On the basis of thegrammars already implemented for some lan-guages covered by the system (French, English,Spanish, Catalan), it is, in fact, easy to develop ageneral Arabic grammar that meets the constraintsof the MedSLT project and to specialize it for thepurposes of speech recognition and generation.This method produces very good results whencompared to commercial systems.3 General MedSLT grammar for ArabicWriting unification grammars for speech presentstwo requirements.
Since it has to be transformedinto context?free grammar (CFG) for recognition,features must have a finite number of values, aslimited as possible.
In practice, this means that at-tributes can not take complex values and the lexi-calist approach used in LFG or HPSG cannot beapplied here.
For example, subcategorization is notrepresented with general rule schemata as inHPSG.
Therefore, syntagmatic rules must be mul-tiplied for each type of verb (transitive, intransi-tive, etc.).
Even if this first constraint results in aless elegant and more repetitive grammar, it is nota limitation to the development of grammars withthe complexity required for such applications.The grammar is used to constrain the recogni-tion process, so it needs to include all informationthat could improve recognition.
For instance,evaluation has shown that the quality of recogni-tion decreases considerably when selection restric-tions are omitted (Rayner, et al, 2006).
Thus, inpractice, this means that all Regulus generalgrammars include many features for managing this43type of constraint.
For example, nouns are seman-tically typed; verbal entries contain features to de-termine the type of complements according to theirsubcategorization, etc.
These types are difficult todefine coherently for the general vocabulary butare not problematic when the domain is very con-trolled and the vocabulary very limited.
In addi-tion, they do not have any effect on the wholestructure of the general grammar since they comefrom specialized lexica of various domains.As with all Regulus grammars, the Arabicgrammar and lexicon are bound by these two re-strictions.
At the present time, they cover onlyquestions in relation to headaches.
The vocabularycontains 322 different forms.
Nouns are semanti-cally typed and verbs specify the type of comple-ments.
For instance, the entry @-=?
(ajrayta,?carry out?)
indicates that the verb selects a subjectwhich is an agent (subj_np_type=agent) and anobject of thera type (therapeutic)(obj_np_type=thera):v:[sem=[[state,tajri],[tense,pass?
]],subcat=trans, agr=2/\sing/\masc,vform=finite, subj_np_type=agent,obj_np_type=thera] -->@a('?', ajrayta).It is interesting to note that features and valuesare the same in Arabic as in other languages exceptfor some differences such as the agr(eement) fea-ture which can take a ?dual?
value, inter alia.
Toavoid the multiplication of entries, particles such as??
(al), ? (bi), ?
(ka), were separated from words towhich they are normally attached.
For recognition,this does not seem to pose a problem.
For genera-tion, they are joined to their heads according tospecific orthography rules after the generation ofsentences.
Since the word is synthesized, it appearsonly in its non-vocalic form.The grammar contains 38 rules that describeyes-no questions introduced by ? (hal), forexample : ?$?
E? 3$ ? ? (hal yamtad al alamila al katifayn, ?Q irradiate-3 the pain to theshoulders?)
and some wh-questions, for example :??
-F E$5 (mata yadhar al alam, ?when appear-3 the pain?).
The grammar structure is, in the end,quite close to romance languages.
As it can happenin Spanish or Catalan, the subject of yes-noquestions in Arabic comes conventionally after theverb (hal yamtad [al alam]_sujet [?]) if notelided when it is agentive (hal [tahus] bi al alam[ 4*G ], ?Q you-feel with the pain?).
Thus, we canthe pain?).
Thus, we can use similar rules appliedto Prodrop and inversion in these languages.
In-version is not dealt with as a type of movementotherwise it would have obliged us to multiply thenumber of features in the grammar.
Instead, we usethe constituent vbar, which is also convenient forArabic.
We consider a yes-no question(yn_question) to be made up of a particle, which is? (hal), and a sentence (s) where the subject iseither elided (inv=prodrop), or comes after theverb (inv=inverted), namely:yn_question:[sem=...] -->@a('?', hal),optional_adverb:[...],s:[...inv=inverted\/prodrop].The s is rewritten in a vp which is itself consti-tuted of a vbar and its complements according tothe type of the verb (transitive, intransitive, etc.)
asis a standard grammar structure:s:[sem=] -->vp:[inv=INV, ?
].vp:[sem=?, inv=INV, ?]
-->vbar:[subcat=trans, inv=INV, ?.],optional_adverb:[?.],np:[?.],optional_adverb:[?],optional_pp:[?.],optional_adverb:[?.
].The vbar is itself composed of a single verb (if thesubject is elided; in this case it has aninv=prodrop feature), or a verb followed by a sub-ject (in such instance, it has a inv=inverted fea-ture) as in rules shown above.
We note that theelision will only be possible here if the verb takes asubject of agent type:vbar:[sem=?,inv=prodrop] -->optional_v:[agr=2/\masc/\sing,subj_np_type=agent].vbar:[sem=..,inv=inverted] -->optional_v:[],np:[].The treatment of wh-questions is more conven-tional in all languages because it is not possible tohandle them without simulating movement.
Weconsider that the interrogative pronoun moved44from its initial place (PP, etc.
), which becomesempty, to an initial position (ayna_i tahus bi alalam [i], ? G4* ?, ?where you-feel with thepain?).
To deal with the movement, we use thestandard mechanism of gap threading, introducedby Pereira (1981).
The link between the emptyconstituent [i] and the constituent which has beenmoved (ayna_i in our example) is possible usingtwo attributes which are gapsin and gapsout, in-cluded in all categories related to the movement.For example, in the following rule, such attributesindicate that the interrogative element (wh_pp) isonly possible if the sentence (s) contains an emptypp (indicated by the attribute gapsin=pp_gap):wh_question:[sem=...] -->wh_pp:[sem=..],s:[?, gapsin=pp_gap, gapsout=B].In comparison with the rest of languages previ-ously processed by the system, the Arabic gram-mar does not have a lot of special cases.
One rulespecifies that some verb such as ?to be?
(??
(kana), ?
( (yakun), with the feature sub-cat=pred(icatif)) can be optional ?
they can be re-written in an empty constituent indicated as []:optional_v:[sem=[[state,be],[tense,present]],subcat=pred] --> [].Rules for numbers are also very complex in or-der to represent the dual form in addition to theposition of numbers which can change dependingon whether the number is singular: one, for exam-ple : more than one day 5 -%??H?
??
(  (akthar minyawm wahid, ?more than day one?)
and, the thirdday K%?)?
? (al yawm al thalith, ?the day thethird?
), or plural, for example : more than 3 days,?
? !L6L 5 -%??
(akthar min thalathat ayam, ?morethan three days?
).4 Grammar specializationOne of the most important advantages of the ap-proach adopted here is that the general grammarcan be specialized for use in different tasks anddomains, to obtain a useful grammar in each case.In the case of Arabic, it is possible to perform gen-eration and recognition directly using the generalgrammar described above, since it is not yet veryelaborate.
The general grammar is however alreadylarge enough to cause serious efficiency problems,When compiled for generation, the general gram-mar overgenerates, as the target structures are flatand underspecified (they do not include, for exam-ple, information on numbers or determiners, cf.examples above).
It would be possible to insertpreference rules to force the intended structure, butthis solution is extremely unattractive from a soft-ware engineering point of view.
When compilingthe grammar for recognition, the situation is evenworse.
All our experiments on other languagesshow that recognizers compiled from generalgrammars either perform very poorly (Bouillon etal 2007), or fail to recognize at all (Rayner et al2006, section 11.7).
As in previous work, we haveattacked these problems by creating specializedversions of the general Arabic grammar.In our approach to grammar specialization, do-main-specific unification grammars are derivedfrom general ones using the Explanation BasedLearning (EBL) technique (Rayner, et al, 2006).This corpus-based specialization process is param-eterized by a training corpus and a set of opera-tionality criteria.
The training corpus, which can berelatively small, consists of examples of utterancesthat should be covered by the domain grammar.
(For Arabic, the current training corpus is about450 sentences).
The sentences of the corpus areparsed using the general grammar, then thoseparses are partitioned into phrases based on theoperationality criteria.
Each phrase defined by theoperationality criteria is flattened, producing rulesof a phrasal  grammar for the application domain.The resulting domain-specific grammar has a sub-set of the coverage of the general grammar andreduced structural ambiguity.
In a generationgrammar, over-generation is virtually eliminated;specialized recognition grammars typically havegreatly superior recognition due to the reduction insearch space that they provide.
In the case of theArabic grammar described here, the training cor-pus is a set of Arabic sentences based on the Eng-lish reference corpus for the headaches domain.The operationality criteria are a slightly modifiedversion of those used for the Romance grammarsdiscussed in Bouillon et al, 2007.In previous work, we have described at lengththe structural relationships between general gram-mars, and specialized grammars for recognitionand generation; here, we will briefly summarize45the main points and show a simple example of howthey apply to our Arabic grammar.
Figures (1) to(3) present parse trees for the sentence ?M? ? ??

In particular, (1) has several nodesfilled by optional modifiers of various kinds, all ofwhich are here null; if this grammar is compiledinto a recognizer, all these nodes result in extrapaths in the search space, with a correspondingloss of efficiency.
Both the specialized grammarsflatten out the modifier structure, for example us-ing learning a set of vp rules which instantiateonly those combinations of modifiers that haveactually been seen in the training corpus.The difference between the specialized recogni-tion grammar (2) and the specialized generationgrammar (3) is more subtle.
The first thing to con-sider is that the recognition version needs to con-tain all the rules required for recognition andanalysis of multiple syntactic variants of the diag-nosis questions, while the generation one only hasto contain sufficient rules to generate one variant(ideally, the most correct and idiomatic one) foreach question.
An important consequence of thisgeneral principle relates to the treatment of NPs.The general grammar includes a rule that forms anNP in a conventional manner from a specifier (id-dat, koul and al, which has been separated from thenoun), potentially optional, and a noun.
This rulepermits a compositional analysis of all the gram-matical combinations of nouns and articles, whichis also appropriate for the recognition grammar.For generation, however, the system learns gener-ally complete (lexicalized) NPs, in order to attachthe appropriate article for each noun on the basis ofthe corpus (there is an exception for NPs contain-ing a number because it is obviously undesirable toinclude in the corpus one example of every num-ber/noun combination).
Contrasting (2) and (3), wesee that in (2), the phrase ? (al alam, ?the pain?
)is treated compositionally; in (3), it is a lexicalizedphrase produced by the rulenp --> ?        (al alam)Our previous experience with French, English andSpanish has shown that this method is a good solu-tion for specialized and limited domains like theone under study.
Articles are difficult to recognize(they are usually short unstressed words) and totranslate, but the right combinations can easily belearnt according to the context and subdomain.
Inthe next section, we show that the specializationmethod yields good results in practice when ap-plied to Arabic.465 EvaluationOur initial evaluation only tests the specializedArabic generation grammar.
We used an Englishcorpus of 522 diagnostic questions gathered withMedSLT, which has previously been used to com-pare linguistic and statistical recognition (Rayneret al, 2004).
Translation were judged by four Ara-bic translators from the Geneva Translation Schoolon the following three-point scale:?
Good : translation respects completely themeaning and the grammatical form;?
OK : translation is not completely idio-matic but understandable;?
Bad : translation does not keep the mean-ing, is non understandable or it is agram-matical.The results are as follows:Evaluation T1 T2 T3 T4Good 365(69.9%)318(60%)323(61%)281(53%)Ok  16(3.1%)63(12%)56(10%)86(16%)Bad  3(0.6%)3(0.6%)5(0.9%)17(3%)Not analyzed sen-tences114 (21.8%)Not translatedsentences21 (4%)Not generatedsentences3 (0.6%)Total  522 (100.0%)We clearly can see that translations are good(Good or Ok) if the sentences are well recog-nized/analyzed in English, which is very importantfor our application (381/408 for T1 (93%),381/408 for T2 (93%), 379/408 for T3 (92%),367/408 for T4, (89.9%)).
Not analyzed sentences(21.8%) are those which are not covered by theEnglish grammar but had to be reformulated in anexistent structure with the help system (see above;Chatzichrisafis, et al, 2006).Three sentences only (0.6%) failed at the levelof generation (Not generated sentences), whichshows that the specialized generation grammar isrobust enough for the domain.
These sentenceshave now to be added in the corpus to be generatedcorrectly.
In other languages, we have indeed no-ticed that this kind of error disappears after one ortwo cycles of evaluation on new data.
Not trans-lated sentences (4%) are mostly caused by spe-cialized medical terms describing pain (pounding,throbbing, etc.)
that we did not introduce yet be-cause they need to be validated by Arabic medicalspecialists.
Here are some examples of Good trans-lations:does chocolate cause your headaches(9? ?)?

One possibility is thus touse a more linguistic approach that takes advantageof the subdomain constraints.
This approach is usu-ally very costly.
However we have shown in thispaper that the MedSLT architecture based on mo-tivated general grammars produces very good re-sults, with a limited effort.
The general grammarcan be developed very easily on the basis of otherlanguages.
The experiments described here showgood results for the Arabic generation grammar.Our initial anecdotal results with the Arabic recog-nizer are promising, and we hope to begin evalua-tion of this component in the near future.ReferencesP.
