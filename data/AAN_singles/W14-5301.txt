Proceedings of the First Workshop on Applying NLP Tools to Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects, pages 1?10,Dublin, Ireland, August 23 2014.Corpus-based Study and Identification of Mandarin Chinese LightVerb VariationsChu-Ren Huang1      Jingxia Lin2     Menghan Jiang1      Hongzhi Xu11Department of CBS, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University2Nanyang Technological Universitychuren.huang@polyu.edu.hk, jingxialin@ntu.edu.sg,menghan.jiang@connect.polyu.hk, hongz.xu@gmail.comAbstractWhen PRC was founded on mainland China and the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1949, therelation between mainland China and Taiwan became a classical Cold War instance.
Neithertravel, visit, nor correspondences were allowed between the people until 1987, whengovernment on both sides started to allow small number of Taiwan people with relatives inChina to return to visit through a third location.
Although the thawing eventually lead tofrequent exchanges, direct travel links, and close commercial ties between Taiwan andmainland China today, 38 years of total isolation from each other did allow the language use todevelop into different varieties, which have become a popular topic for mainly lexical studies(e.g., Xu, 1995; Zeng, 1995; Wang & Li, 1996).
Grammatical difference of these two variants,however, was not well studied beyond anecdotal observation, partly because the near identityof their grammatical systems.
This paper focuses on light verb variations in Mainland andTaiwan variants and finds that the light verbs of these two variants indeed show distributionaltendencies.
Light verbs are chosen for two reasons: first, they are semantically bleached hencemore susceptible to changes and variations.
Second, the classification of light verbs is achallenging topic in NLP.
We hope our study will contribute to the study of light verbs inChinese in general.
The data adopted for this study was a comparable corpus extracted fromChinese Gigaword Corpus and manually annotated with contextual features that maycontribute to light verb variations.
A multivariate analysis was conducted to show that for eachlight verb there is at least one context where the two variants show differences in tendencies(usually the presence/absence of a tendency rather than contrasting tendencies) and can bedifferentiated.
In addition, we carried out a K-Means clustering analysis for the variations andthe results are consistent with the multivariate analysis, i.e.
the light verbs in Mainland andTaiwan indeed have variations and the variations can be successfully differentiated.1 Introduction: Language Variations in the Chinese ContextCommonly dichotomy of language and dialect is not easily maintained in the context of Chineselanguage(s).
Cantonese, Min, Hakka, and Wu are traditionally referred to as dialects of Chinese butare mutually unintelligible.
However, they do share a common writing system and literary and textualtradition, which allows speakers to have a shared linguistic identity.
To overcome the mutualunintelligibility problem, a variant of Northern Mandarin Chinese, is designated as the commonlanguage about a hundred years ago (called ???
Putonghua ?common language?
in MainlandChina, and ??
Guoyu ?national language?
in Taiwan).
Referred to as Mandarin or MandarinChinese, or simply Chinese nowadays, this is the one of the most commonly learned first or secondlanguages in the world now.
However, not unlike English, with the fast globalization of the Chineselanguage, both the term ?World Chineses?
and the recognition that there are different variants ofChinese emerged.
In this paper, we studied two of the most important variants of Chinese, MainlandMandarin and Taiwan Mandarin.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

A number of studies were carried out on lexical variationsbetween these two variants of Mandarin Chinese, including variations in the meanings of the sameword or using different words to express the same meaning (e.g., Xu, 1995; Zeng, 1995; Wang,1996).Some dictionaries also list the lexical differences between Mainland Mandarin and Taiwan Mandarin(e.g., Qiu, 1990; Wei & Sheng, 2000).By contrast, only a few of such studies were corpus driven (e.g.
Hong and Huang 2008, 2013;Huang and Lin, 2013), and even few studies have been done on the grammatical variations ofMainland and Taiwan Chinese.
Huang et al.
(2013), the only such study based on comparable corporaso far, suggested that the subtlety of the underlining grammatical variations of these two dialectalvariants at early stage of divergence may have contributed to the challenge as well as scarcity ofprevious studies.1.2 Light Verbs in Light Verb VariationsThe study of English light verb constructions (LVCs) (e.g., take a look, make an offer) has been animportant topic in linguistics (Jespersen, 1965; Butt and Geuder, 2003; among others) as well as inComputational Linguistics (Tu and Dan, 2011; Nagy et al., 2013; Hwang et al., 2010; among others).Identification of LVCs is a fundamental crucial task for Natural Language Processing (NLP)applications, such as information retrieval and machine translation.
For example, Tu and Dan (2011)proposed a supervised learning system to automatically identify English LVCs by training with groupsof contextual or statistical features.
Nagy et al.
(2013) introduced a system that enables the fullcoverage identification of English LVCs in running context by using a machine leaning approach.However, little work has been done to identify Chinese LVCs, especially between differentvariants of Chinese (cf.
Hwang et al., 2010).
Chinese LVCs are similar to English LVCs in the sensethat the light verb itself is semantically bleached and does not contain any eventive or contentiveinformation, so the predicative information of the construction mainly comes from the complementtaken by the light verb (e.g., Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982).
For instance, ??
jinxing originallymeant ?move forward/proceed?, but in an LVC such as????
jinxing taolun proceed discuss ?todiscuss?, ??
jinxing only contributes aspectual information whereas the core meaning of the LVCcomes from the complement ??
taolun ?discuss?.
Chinese also differs from English in that many ofthe Chinese light verbs have similar usages and thus are often interchangeable, e.g., all the five lightverbs ??
congshi, ?
gao, ??
jiayi, ??
jinxing, and ?
zuo can take ??
yanjiu ?do research?as their complement and form a LVC.
But Huang et al.
(2013) also observed that differences incollocation constraints can sometimes be found between different variants of Mandarin Chinese.
Forinstance, constructions like ????
jinxing tou-piao proceed cast-ticket ?to cast votes?, where thecomplement is in the V(erb)-O(bject) form, usually can only be found in Taiwan Mandarin.
Hence,Chinese LVCs are challenging for both linguistic studies and computational applications in twoaspects: (a) to identify collocation constraints of the different light verbs in order to automaticallyclassify and predict their uses in context, and (b) to identify the collocation constraints of the samelight verb in order to differentiate and predict the two Chinese variants based on the use of such lightverbs.
The first issue has been explored in Lin et al.
(2014): by analyzing Mainland and TaiwanMandarin data extracted from comparable corpora with statistical and machine learning approaches,the authors find the five light verbs??
congshi, ?
gao, ??
jiayi, ??
jinxing, and ?
zuo canbe reliably differentiated from each other in each variety.
But to the best of our knowledge, there hasbeen no previous computational study on modeling the light verb variations, or other syntacticvariations of Chinese dialects or variants of the same dialect.
Therefore, this paper builds on the studyof Lin et al.
(2014) and will adopt a comparable corpus driven approach to model light verb variationsin Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin.2 Data and annotationOur study focuses on five light verbs, ??
jiayi, ??
jinxing, ??
congshi, ?
gao and ?
zuo(these words literally meant ?proceed?, ?inflict?, ?engage?, ?do?, and ?do?
respectively).
These five are2chosen for two reasons.
First, they are the most frequently used light verbs in Mandarin Chinese (Diao,2004); second, although the definition of Chinese light verbs is still debatable, these five areconsidered the most typical light verbs in most previous studies.The data for this study was extracted from the Annotated Chinese Gigaword Corpus (Huang, 2009)maintained by LDC which contains over 1.1 billion Chinese words, consisting of 700 millioncharacters from Taiwan Central News Agency (CNA) and 400 million characters from MainlandXinhua News Agency (XNA).
For each of the five light verbs, 400 sentences were randomly selected,half from the Mainland XNA corpus and the other half from the Taiwan CNA Corpus, which results in2,000 sentences in total.Previous studies (Zhu, 1985; Zhou, 1987; Cai, 1982; Huang et al., 2013; among others) haveproposed several syntactic and semantic features to compare and identify the similarities anddifferences among light verbs.
For example, while Taiwan ??
congshi can take informal orsemantically negative event complements such as ???
xingjiaoyi ?sexual trade?, Mainland ?
?congshi is rarely found with such complements (Huang et al.
2013).In our study, we selected 11 features covering both syntactic and semantic features which may helpto identify light verb variations, as in Table 1.
All 2,000 sentences with light verbs were manuallyannotated with the 11 features.
The annotator is a trained expert on Chinese linguistics.
All ambiguouscases were discussed with another two experts in order to reach an agreement (the features andannotation were the same with Lin et al.
(2014)).3 Modelling and Predicting Two VariantsWe carried out both a multivariate analysis and machine learning algorithm to explore the possibledifferences existing between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin light verbs.
Our analysis shows that foreach light verb, there is at least one context where the two variants of Mandarin show differences inusage tendencies and thus can be differentiated, although the differences more often lie in thepresence/absence of a tendency rather than complementary distribution.3.1 Multivariate Analysis of Light Verb VariationsAs introduced in Section 1, the five or some of the five light verbs sometimes can be interchangeablyused in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin.
This indicates that the interchangeable light verbs sharesome features.
In other words, it is unlikely that a particular feature is preferred by only one light verband thus differentiates the verb from the others.
This is also proved in Lin et al.
(2014).
For instance,their study finds both Mainland and Taiwan ??
congshi and ?
gao significantly prefer nominalcomplements (POS.N).
Therefore, to better explore the light verb differences in the two variants, weadopt a multivariate analysis for this study.The multivariate analysis we used is polytomous logistic regression (Arppe 2008, cf.
Han et al.2013, Bresnan et al.
2007), and the tool we used is the Polytomous() function in the Polytoumouspackage in R (Arppe 2008).
The polytomous logistic regression is an extension of standard logisticregression; it calculates the odds of the occurrence of a particular light verb when a particular featureis present, with all other features being equal (Arppe, 2008).
In addition, it also allows forsimultaneous estimation of the occurrence probability of all the five light verbs.Before we discuss the light verb variations based on multivariate analysis, we will show that thepolytomous multivariate model adopted is reliable for our study.
Table 2 presents the probabilityestimates of Mainland and Taiwan light verbs calculated by the model.
The results indicate that theoverall performance of the model is good: the most frequently predicted light verb (in each column)corresponds to the light verb that actually occurs in the data (in each row) (see the numbers in bold).In addition, the recall, precision, and F-measure of the estimates given in Table 3 show that eachlight verb in each variant can be successfully identified with a F-score better than chance (0.2), whilethe performance varies from light verb to light verb, which is thus consistent with the results in Lin etal.
(2014).
The only exception is ?
gao in Mainland Mandarin, but the low F-score of ?
gao (0.14) isconsistent with the linguistic observation that this verb is rarely used as a light verb in MainlandMandarin.
More detailed information of the factors that can distinguish the five light verbs in each3variant can also be found in Table 4.
In the following of this section, we focus on the variations ofeach light verb in Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin.Feature ID Explanation Values (example)1.

The numbers inthe table are the odds for the features in favor of or against the occurrence of each light verb: oddslarger than 1 indicate that the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantly increased by thefeature, e.g., the chance of Mainland ??
jiayi occurring is significantly increased by ARGSTRtwo(76.47: 1), followed by ACCOMPEVTyes (56.25: 1), VOCOMPyes (23.54: 1), PSYEVTyes (19.87:1); odds smaller than 1 indicate that the chance of the occurrence of a light verb is significantlydescreased by the feature, e.g., the chance of Mainland ??
jinxing occurring is significantlydecreased by ACCOMPEVTyse (0.1849: 1); in addition, ?inf?
and ?1/inf?
refer to odds larger than10,000 and smaller than 1/10,000 respectively, and non-significant odds (p-value < 0.05) are given inparentheses, regardless of the odds value.Table 4 finds that Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin indeed show some variations in each light verb.Furthermore, the variations of each light verb mainly lie in non-complementary distributional patterns.That is, as highlighted in dark grey colour in Table 4, the odds differences are more often betweennon-significance (odds in parentheses) and significance (odds larger or smaller than 1), rather thanbetween significant preference (odds larger than 1) and significant dis-preference (odds smaller than1).
In other words, the difference of a light verb in the two variants is more comparative, rather than5contrastive.
This explains why the variations are not easily found by traditional linguistic studies.The following summarizes the key variations of each light verb.??
congshi??
congshi in both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin has no feature significantly in its favor and itis significantly disfavored by ARGSTRtwo (taking two-argument complements, e.g., ??
yanjiu ?toresearch?)
and INTEREVTyes (taking complements denoting interactive activities, e.g., ?
?shangliang ?to discuss?).
However, Taiwan ??
congshi is differentiated from Mainland ?
?congshi in that the former is also disfavored by FOREVTyes (taking complements denoting formalevents, e.g., ??
yanjiu ?to research?)
and VOCOMPyes (taking complements in the form of V(erb)-O(bject), e.g., ??
toupiao ?cast a vote?
), whereas the latter is not.
The finding that Taiwan ?
?congshi is less likely to take formal event as its complement is consistent with that in Huang et al.(2013).?
gaoBoth Mainland and Taiwan ?
gao are significantly favored by ARGSTRzero (taking zero-argumentcomplements, i.e.
noun complement in this study).
However, compared with Taiwan Mandarin,Mainland ?
gao is more likely to take two-argument complements (ARGSTRtwo), but less likely totake complements denoting accomplishment events (ACCOMPEVTyes, e.g., ??
jiejue ?to solve?
),and it is also disfavored by the aggregate of default variable values (i.e.
the intercept, 0.02: 1).??
jiayiBoth Mainland and Taiwan ?
?
jiayi are favored by the feature ACCOMPEVTyes(accomplishment complement such as ??
jiejue ?to solve?
), but the chance of occurrence ofMainland ??
jiayi increases with the presence of two-argument complements (ARGSTRtwo),complements in VO form (VOCOMPyes), and complements denoting mental or phychologicalactivities (PSYEVTyes, e.g., ??
fanxing ?to introspect?).??
jinxingBoth Mainland and Taiwan ??
jinxing have INTEREVTyes (taking complements denotinginteractive activities) and EVECOMPyes (allowing event complements in subject position, e.g., ??????
huiyi jinxing shunli meeting procced smoothly ?The meeting proceeded smoothly?)
in theirfavor.
However, ??
jinxing in Mainland Mandarin is less likely to take accomplishmentcomplements (ACCOMPEVTyes); whereas ??
jinxing in Taiwan Mandarin is more disfavored byARGSTRzero, but more likely to take complements in VO form, which is also consistent with thefindings in Huang et al.
(2013).?
zuoThe occurrence of ?
zuo in Mainland Mandarin is decreased by factors such as ARGSTRtwo,FOREVTyes, and INTEREVTyes, whereas the occurrence of ?
zuo in Taiwan Mandarin is decreasedby ACCOMPTEVTyes, but significantly increased by ASPle.
It is obvious to linguists that ?
zuo inboth Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are frequently found with the perfective marker ?
le, but ouranalysis reveals that the affixation ?
le to Taiwan ?
zuo is much more frequent than that in Mainland.3.2 Clustering Analysis of Light Verb VariationsWe adopted a vector space model (VSM) to represent the use of light verbs.
The features in Table 1could be expanded to 17 binary features.
For example, ASP could be expanded into four binaryfeatures: ASP.le, ASP.zhe, ASP.guo, ASP.none.
Each instance of a light verb in the corpus wasrepresented by a vector with 17 dimensions.
Each dimension stores the value of one of the 17 binaryfeatures determined by the context where the light verb is used.6Cluster ID 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9congshi TW 39 43 1 84 2 21 4 4 1 1ML 62 48 0 83 1 4 1 1 0 0gao TW 38 141 0 0 9 10 2 0 4 0ML 88 64 3 8 11 5 10 4 6 4jiayi TW 152 0 6 28 11 2 0 4 0 0ML 117 3 6 62 18 2 5 14 1 1jinxing TW 26 79 7 2 38 30 0 3 15 1ML 23 80 16 0 55 22 5 2 1 0zuo TW 20 3 0 2 23 130 20 2 1 6ML 23 44 3 16 38 45 20 11 8 3Table 5: The distribution of data origin by the clustering result.Then we adopt a clustering algorithm K-Means to identify the variations of light verbs in Taiwanand Mainland Mandarin.
The assumption is that the instances of a light verb will form differentclusters in the hyperspace according to the distances among them.
Each cluster reflects a special use ofa light verb.
For example, there could be one cluster, where all the instances take non-accomplishmentevent argument, e.g., ????/??/??
jiayi fenxi/ yanjiu/ pinglun inflict analyze/ research/comment ?to analyze/ research/ comment?, etc.In this sense, if there are light verb variations between Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, the lightverbs will be distributed to two clusters, one with data mainly from Mainland Mandarin, whereas theother mainly from Taiwan Mandarin.
Meanwhile, if a cluster contains much more data from onevariant than the other, it indicates the usage of a light verb is mainly restricted to the variant with moredata; or if a cluster contains data of similar amount from both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin, itindicates that the two variants share common usages regarding the light verbs.
Therefore, for eachlight verb, all 400 examples from both Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin are mixed together for theanalysis.As the K-Means algorithm requires an input of the number N of the clusters, the selection of N isthen an issue we need to consider.
Remembering that the clusters reflect the use of a light verb ratherthan data origin, the selection of N should be based on the consideration of how many different uses alight verb may have.
As there are 17 expanded binary features, the whole space of the values of thevectors is 217 = 128K.
However, the number of different uses for a light verb should not be too large.There is no problem if N is set slightly larger than the real number of different uses of a light verb.
Forexample, if there are 5 different uses for a light verb and we set N=6, then we can imagine that theremay be two clusters that reflect the same use of the light verb.
On the contrary, if N is set too small, alldifferent uses will be mixed together.
Then, the clustering result may not be able to show anyinteresting result we expected.
In our experiments, we set N=10 for all the five light verbs.
Especially,we use the WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) implementation of the simple K-Means for our experiments.
Theresult is shown in Table 5.
The key variations of each light verb are summarized as follows.??
congshiCluster 5 shows that Mainland ??
congshi prefers to take complements denoting formal orofficial events in Mainland Mandarin.
However, Taiwan ??
congshi does not show such preferenceas it can take both formal and informal events.
Clusters 6 and 9 show that Taiwan ??
congshi canalso take complements in VO form, e.g., ????
jinxing kaipiao proceed ballot counting ?to proceedwith ballot counting?, but this is not preferred by Mainland ??
congshi.?
gaoClusters 6 and 7 together show that the argument of Mainland ?
gao can occur in the subjectposition in addition to the complement position, but such word order is rarely found in Taiwan data.Cluster 3 shows a possibility for Mainland ?
gao to take arguments denoting events involvinginteractions of participants (e.g., ??
taolun ?to discuss?).
In addition, Cluster 9 shows the possibility7that Mainland?
gao can take complements describing informal events, while the complements toTaiwan Mainland ?
gao are more often formal events (especially political activities).??
jiayiCluster 7 suggests Mainland ??
jiayi show a preference over complements denoting mental orpsychological events.
However, although Clusters 1 and 6 show some difference between Mainlandand Taiwan ??
jiayi, our closer examination of the original data found that such differences actuallydo not reflect any variant-specific uses.??
jinxingCluster 6 suggests that Mainland??
jinxing show a preference over the aspectual marker ?
-le,but such preference is not seen in Taiwan ??
jinxing.
Cluster 8 shows a preference by Taiwan?
?jinxing that it could take VO compound (e.g., ??
toupiao cast-ticket ?to vote?)
as complements,while this rarely happens in Mainland.?
zuoClusters 1 and 3 show that in Mainland Mandarin, it is common for ?
zuo to take the aspectualmarker ?
-le, but such use of ?
zuo in Taiwan is not as common as in Mainland.To sum up, the results from the machine learning method are consistent with that from themultivariate statistical analysis in Section 3.1.
Bringing together, we find that while the light verbs inMainland and Taiwan Mandarin show similarities (as the speakers of these two regions cancommunicate without difficulty), there are indeed also variations in the two variants.4 Concluding RemarksOur study is the one of the first comparable corpus driven computational modeling studies on newlyemergent language variants.
The automatic identification of Mainland and Taiwan syntactic variationshas very significant linguistic and computational implications.
Linguistically, we showed that ourcomparable corpus driven statistical approach can identify comparative differences which arechallenging for human analysis.
The fact that newly emergent variants differ from each othercomparatively rather than contrastively may also have important linguistics implications.
In addition,by successfully differentiating these two variants based on their uses of light verbs, the result alsosuggests that variations among such newly emergent variants may arise from categories that aresemantically highly bleached and tend to be/or have been grammaticalized.
Computationally, theability of machine learning approaches to differentiate Mainland and Taiwan variants of MandarinChinese potentially contributes to overcoming the challenge of automatic identification of subtlelanguage/dialect variations among other light verbs, other lexical categories, as well as otherlanguages/dialects.AcknowledgementsThe work is supported by a General Research Fund (GRF) sponsored by the Research Grants Council(Project no.
