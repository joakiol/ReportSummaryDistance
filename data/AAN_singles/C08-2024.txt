MoszkowiczComputer Science DepartmentBrandeis Universityjlittman@cs.brandeis.eduAbstractWe propose a spatio-temporal markup forthe annotation of motion predicates in text,informed by a lexical semantic classifica-tion of these verbs.
We incorporate thisclassification within a spatial event struc-ture, based on Generative Lexicon Theory.We discuss how the spatial event structuresuggests changes to annotation systems de-signed solely for temporal or spatial phe-nomena, resulting in spatio-temporal an-notation.1 Introduction and MotivationThe recognition of spatial entities in natural lan-guage is an important component of understandinga text (Mani et al, 2008).
However, simply iden-tifying fixed geospatial regions and specific ?facil-ities?
is not enough to achieve a complete repre-sentation of all the spatial phenomena present.
Infact, this leaves out one of the most crucial aspectsof spatial information, motion.
To capture motion,we must integrate temporal and spatial informationwith the lexical semantics of motion predicates andprepositions.The goal of this research is to further the rep-resentational support for spatio-temporal reason-ing from natural language text in the service ofpractical applications.
To create such support, wepropose to use lexical resources for motion predi-cates to integrate two existing annotation schemes,SpatialML and TimeML, creating a representationthat captures, in a fine-grained manner, the move-ment of individuals through spatial and temporalc?

This work is part of a larger effort to au-tomate such annotation and reasoning over naturallanguage documents using symbolic and machinelearning methods.In this paper, we investigate different resourcesand annotations for spatio-temporal information.In section 2, we describe some of the resources weemployed for our investigation.
Section 3 elabo-rates on the classes we focus on as we work to-wards developing a classification for the purposeof annotating motion predicates, which we discussin section 4.2 Previous Work on MotionClassifications in LanguageThere has been considerable research on the lin-guistic behavior of spatial predicates and preposi-tions in language (e.g., (Jackendoff, 1983), (Her-skovits, 1986), (Boas, 2001), (Cappelle and De-clerck, 2005)).
Within qualitative spatial reasoning(QSR), work has recently started to focus on incor-porating mereo-topological concepts into the cal-culus of relations between regions.
The most suc-cessful of these is the Regional Connection Calcu-lus, or RCC (Randell et al, 1992).
RCC8 and othersystems like it do an adequate job of represent-ing static information about space, but they cannothelp us deal with motion, since that task requires atemporal component.
Galton ((Galton, 1993; Gal-ton, 1997)) began work on a commonsense theoryof motion, but this work did not focus on mergingtemporal and spatial phenomena.
Muller (Muller,1998), however, proposes just such a system withhis qualitative theory of motion based on spatio-temporal primitives.
The result of Muller?s systemis a set of six motion classes: leave, hit, reach, ex-ternal, internal, and cross.Asher and Sablayrolles offer their own account95of motion verbs and spatial prepositional phrasesin French (Asher and Sablayrolles, 1995).
Theypropose ten groups of motion verbs as follows:s?approcher (to approach), arriver (to arrive), en-trer (to enter), se poser (to alight), s?
?eloigner (todistance oneself from), partir (to leave), sortir (togo out), d?ecoller (to take off), passer (par) (to gothrough), d?evier (to deviate).
This verb classifica-tion is more fine-grained than Muller?s.While Muller, Asher, Sablayrolles, and Vieuamong others have focused on the formal seman-tics of motion, other work has been done to repre-sent motion in the FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998)and VerbNet (Kipper et al, 2006) projects.
TheMotion frame is a high level frame in the FrameNethierarchy.
It is defined as ?Some entity (Theme)starts out in one place (Source) and ends up insome other place (Goal), having covered somespace between the two (Path).
?To explore VerbNet?s take on motion predicates,we mapped Asher and Sablayrolles?
verbs to Verb-Net classes.
The mapping revealed that, whilemany of the motion predicates we care about havespecific classes in VerbNet, it is not always clearwhat these classes have in common unless we lookto FrameNet to find a higher level representation.3 Classifying spatio-temporal predicatesFollowing (Muller, 1998), (Vieu, 1991), and(Asher and Sablayrolles, 1995), we assume spatialvariables are incorporated into the representationof motion predicates in language.
For this paper,we generally follow (Muller, 2002) by represent-ing the individuals participating in spatial relationsas spatio-temporal regions (s?i).
For modeling mo-tion, however, we restrict our discussion to spatio-temporal regions occupied by physical matter de-noted by the type s ?
i ?
p.For this work, we performed several map-pings between Muller, Asher and Sablayrolles, andFrameNet.
The result of this mapping was a groupof classes based largely on Muller?s classificationswith some very slight modifications detailed in thetable below.
The spatial event structures for eachof these classes will describe their formal seman-tics (as in Figure 1 below).In addition to these classes, we model the spatialsemantics of prepositions, following (Asher andSablayrolles, 1995), generally.
Because of spacelimitations, we will not discuss the contritbutionof prepositional semantics in this paper.Move run, fly, driveMove External drive around, passMove Internal walk around the roomLeave leave, desertReach arrive, enter, reachDetach take off, disconnect, pull awayHit land, hitFollow follow, chaseDeviate flee, run fromStay remain, stayTable 1: Motion ClassesThere is a complex interaction between a motionverb class and the interpretation of its arguments.For example, not all regions are occupied by theextent of physical matter (see above), but there aresome objects which are properly both physical andspatial, such as the concept building.
Notice theambiguity inherent in the statement below, whereboth Move Internal and Move External are pos-sible interpretations.
(1) The man walked around the building.This is due to the semantic nature of building asboth a physical object with extent, and also as avolume/aperture.To model the mapping of objects to specific ar-gument and event structures, we adopt the frame-work of Generative Lexicon Theory (GL).
The no-tion of ?polarity?
in the (Muller, 1998) sense isquite similar to the semantic effect brought aboutby event headedness in (Pustejovsky, 1995).
GLprovides an explicitly typed argument structure,a typed subeventual structure, and a predicativebody, which we will use to express RCC8 rela-tions.
For example, a representation of the Spa-tial Event Structure (SES) for the motion predicateleave is illustrated below in Figure 1.
Note thatthe statement Polarity=initial is equivalent to say-ing Head=left.
The relation BT is shorthand forboundary transition, which is composed of the fol-lowing RCC8 relations: TPP, O, and EC.Each motion class in Table 1 maps to a uniquepredicative body (qualia structure) in the spatialevent structure for a verb.
We demonstrate be-low how these representations are then embed-ded in the annotation of a text as RCC8 relationsin a modified SpatialML/TimeML format, calledSpatio-temporal Markup (STM).The robustness of the mapping from the motionclasses in Table 1 to FrameNet is currently being96??????????????

?Figure 1: Spatial Event Structuretested and evaluated.4 Spatio-temporal AnnotationThroughout the development of the classificationdescribed here, we have tried to focus on howthe classification will impact the task of annotat-ing spatio-temporal information in text.
There arecurrently two distinct annotation schemes for spa-tial and temporal information.
If we are to suc-cessfully capture motion phenomena in text, theseannotations must be merged just as a topologicalbase and a temporal calculus need to be combinedto model motion predicates.TimeML (Pustejovsky et al, 2003) is an anno-tation scheme for representing temporal informa-tion in text.
The basic elements of a TimeML an-notation are temporal expressions such as dates,times, and durations, and events that can be an-chored or ordered to those expressions or with re-spect to each other.For the annotation of spatial information, Spa-tialML (MITRE, 2007) is being developed.
Thefocus of SpatialML is the markup of spatial lo-cations that can be integrated with additional re-sources such as databases that provide informa-tion about a given domain (e.g.
physical featuredatabases, gazetteers).While SpatialML does a reasonable job of cap-turing locations in space, it cannot model movingobjects such as people and cars, and in fact lacks amechanism for capturing motion since predicatesare not annotated.
As we saw above, the motionevent must be captured in addition to the locationsinvolved in the motion.
The development of ourmotion classification also reveals that the partici-pants of the event are also needed, even if they arenot spatial locations.
For example, in John flew toBoston, John must be included in the motion anno-tation because he is a moving object.We can enhance the spatio-temporal informa-tion from SpatialML and TimeML with lexical se-mantic information from a lexicon of motion pred-icates, resulting in annotation that is rich enoughto be able to (1) infer motion of individuals in-vovled in specific events; and (2) to compose mo-tions to create motion sequences (cf.
(Pustejovskyand Verhagen, 2007)).To create a spatio-temporal markup, TimeMLand SpatialML must be enriched so that they canadequately capture the motion predicates we arediscussing.
TimeML will already annotate motionpredicates as events, but to truly reveal the motioninvolved, additional attributes must be added to ac-count for the beginning, middle, and end points ofthe event.
The spatio-temporal annotation will re-quire a new kind of spatial link to capture motionpaths.
Essentially, the motion path will combinethe event information from TimeML with the spa-tial information from SpatialML.
This motion pathis at the core of a spatio-temporal markup or STM.The spatial event structure described in the previ-ous section motivates the construction of the STM.The concept of polarity or headedness will alsomotivate some aspects of the annotation.
Depend-ing on the polarity of the motion predicate or spa-tial prepositional phrase, the annotator will knowto look for the source or goal of the event in thetext and include that in the motion path.The exact details of the resulting spatio-temporal markup are still under development.However, the following examples give an idea ofhow motion class information allow us to integratespatial and temporal annotation.
(2) John drove from Boston to NY on Thursday.<MOVER id=0>John</MOVER><EVENT id=1 tense=past start=t1 end=t2>drove</EVENT><SIGNAL id=2 type=spatial polarity=initial>from</SIGNAL><PLACE id=3>Boston</PLACE><SIGNAL id=4 type=spatial polarity=final>to</SIGNAL><PLACE id=5>New York</PLACE><SIGNAL id=6 type=temporal>on</SIGNAL><TIMEX3 id=7>Thursday</TIMEX3><TLINK eventID=1 timeID=7 relType=INCLUDESsignalID=6 /><MOTION eventID=1 moverID=0 source=3sourceTime=t1 sourceSignal=2 goal=5goalTime=t2 goalSignal=4 class=MOVE/>(3) John left Boston for New York.<MOVER id=0>John</MOVER><EVENT id=1 tense=past start=t1 end=t2polarity=intitial>left</EVENT><PLACE id=2>Boston</PLACE><SIGNAL id=3 type=spatialpolarity=final>for</SIGNAL><PLACE id=4>New York</PLACE><MOTION eventID=1 moverID=0 source=2 sourceTime=t1goal=4 goalTime=t2 goalSignal=3 class=LEAVE/>97The Motion tag in the above examples tells usthe class of the motion predicate.
This provides alink to both the spatial event structure (as in Figure1) and a spatio-temporal markup, which embedsthe annotaton of a text as RCC8 relations in a mod-ified SpatialML/TimeML format.
The example in4 shows the STM for leave:(4)?????????
?motionTYPE = leaveEVENTID = eMOVERID = xSOURCE = l1SOURCETIME = t1GOAL = l2GOALTIME = t2??????????=?
[IN(t1, x, l1)IN(t2, x, l2)DC(t2, x, l1)]This STM indicates what additional informationis needed for the spatio-temporal annotation.
Inthe case of example 3, three temporally anchoredSpatialML link tags are indiated for each of theRCC8-like relations to the second part of the STM:(5) <LINK linkType=IN source=0 target=2 time=t1/><LINK linkType=DC source=0 target=2 time=t2/><LINK linkType=IN source=0 target=4 time=t2/>These links that can be automatically generatedat a later stage in the annotation set up the locationsof moving objects at given times.
The first link inexample 5 reveals that the moving object John wasin Boston at time t1, which is the start time of themotion given in the annotation.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we investigate how an expressiveclassification for verbs of motion can be used tointegrate spatial and temporal annotation infor-mation, in order to represent objects in motion,as expressed in text.
We adopt a modified ver-sion of the classifications of verbs of motion in(Muller, 1998) and (Asher and Sablayrolles, 1995)and demonstrated how verb classes are mapped toRCC8+1 relations in a temporally anchored Spa-tialML.
We are currently evaluating the reliabilityof the FrameNet encoding of motion predicates,and are developing algorithms for translating lexi-cal structures to Spatio-temporal markup.ReferencesAsher, N. and P. Sablayrolles.
