Weuse Support Vector Machines as our learningalgorithm and train separate models for eventtypes that are described with a single themeparticipant, multiple theme participants, or atheme and a cause participant.
We perform ex-periments with linear kernel and edit-distancebased kernel and report our results on theBioNLP?09 Shared Task test data set.1 IntroductionMost previous work on biomedical information ex-traction focuses on identifying relationships amongbiomedical entities (e.g.
protein-protein interac-tions).
Unlike relationships, which are in generalcharacterized with a pair of entities, events can becharacterized with event types and multiple entitiesin varying roles.
The BioNLP?09 Shared Task ad-dresses the extraction of bio-molecular events fromthe biomedical literature (Kim et al, 2009).
We par-ticipated in the ?Event Detection and Characteriza-tion?
task (Task 1).
The goal was to recognize theevents concerning the given proteins by detectingthe event triggers, determining the event types, andidentifying the event participants.In this study, we approach the problem as a su-pervised classification task.
We group the eventtypes into three general classes based on the num-ber and types of participants that they involve.
Thefirst class includes the event types that are describedwith a single theme participant.
The second class in-cludes the event types that are described with one ormore theme participants.
The third class includesthe events that are described with a theme and/ora cause participant.
We learn support vector ma-chine (SVM) models for each class of events to clas-sify each candidate event trigger/participant pair asa real trigger/participant pair or not.
We use vari-ous types of linguistic features such as lexical, posi-tional, and dependency relation features that repre-sent the contexts of the candidate trigger/participantpairs.
The results that we submitted to the sharedtask were based on using a linear kernel function.
Inthis paper, we also report our results based on usingan edit-distance based kernel defined on the shortestdependency relation type paths between a candidatetrigger/participant pair.2 System Description2.1 Event Type ClassesWe grouped the nine event types targeted at theBioNLP?09 Shared Task into three general eventclasses based on the number and types of partici-pants that they involve.Class 1 Events: Events that involve a single theme participant(Gene expression, Transcription, Protein catabolism, Lo-calization, and Phosphorylation event types).Class 2 Events: Events that can involve one or more themeparticipants (Binding event type).Class 3 Events: Events that can be described with a themeand/or a cause participant (Regulation, Positive regula-tion, and Negative regulation event types).
Unlike Class 1111and Class 2 events, where the participants are proteins, theparticipants of Class 3 events can be proteins or events.Since the event types in each class are similar toeach other based on the number and roles of par-ticipants that they involve and different from theevent types in the other classes, we learned sepa-rate classification models for each class.
We for-mulated the classification task as the classificationof trigger/participant pairs.
We extracted positiveand negative training instances (trigger/participantpairs) from the training data for each class of events.We considered only the pairs that appear in thesame sentence.
We used the tokenized and sentencesplit abstracts provided by the shared task organiz-ers1.
Consider the sentence ?The phosphorylation ofTRAF2 inhibits binding to the CD40 cytoplasmic do-main?.
This sentence describes the following threeevents:1.
Event1: Type: Phosphorylation Trigger: phosphorylationTheme: TRAF22.
Event2: Type: Binding Trigger: binding Theme1:TRAF2 Theme2: CD403.
Event3: Type: Negative regulation Trigger: inhibitsTheme: Event2 Cause: Event1Event1 belongs to Class 1.
The trigger/participantpair (phosphorylation, TRAF2) is a positive instancefor Class 1.
Event2 belongs to Class 2.
It hastwo theme participants.
The instances for Class 2events are created by decomposing the events intotrigger/theme pairs.
The two positive instances ex-tracted from the decomposition of Event2 are (bind-ing, TRAF2) and (binding, CD40).
Event3 belongsto Class 3.
It consists of two semantically differ-ent participants, namely a theme and a cause.
Wetrained two separate models for Class 3 events, i.e.,one model to classify the themes and another modelto classify the causes.
Another distinguishing char-acteristic of Class 3 events is that a participant ofan event can be a protein or an event.
We repre-sent the participants that are events with their cor-responding event triggers.
We decompose Event3into its theme and cause and represent its causeEvent1 with its trigger word ?phosphorylation?
and1http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/SharedTask/tools.htmlits theme Event2 with its trigger word ?binding?.
Asa result, (inhibits, binding) and (inhibits, phosphory-lation) are included as positive instances to the Class3 theme and Class 3 cause training sets, respectively.Negative instances for Class 1 and Class 2 are cre-ated by including all the trigger/protein pairs whichare not among the positive instances of that class.Negative instances for Class 3 theme and Class 3cause are created by including all the trigger/proteinand trigger1/trigger2 pairs which are not among thepositive instances of that class.
For example, (phos-phorylation, CD40) is a negative instance for Class1 and (inhibits, TRAF2) is a negative instance forClass 3 theme and Class 3 cause.2.2 Feature Extraction2.2.1 Lexical and Part-of-Speech FeaturesWe used the candidate trigger and its part-of-speech, which was obtained by using the StanfordParser, as features, based on our observation that dif-ferent candidate triggers might have different likeli-hoods of being a real trigger for a certain event.
Forexample, ?transcription?
is a trigger for the Tran-scription event 277 times in the training set and hasnot been used as a trigger for other types of events.On the other hand, ?concentration?
is used onlyonce as a trigger for a Transcription event and threetimes as a trigger for Regulation events.2.2.2 Positional FeaturesWe used two features to represent the relative po-sition of the participant with regard to the triggerin the sentence.
The first feature has two values,namely ?before?
(the participant appears before thetrigger) or ?after?
(the participant appears after thetrigger).
The second feature encodes the distancebetween the trigger and the participant.
Distance ismeasured as the number of tokens between the trig-ger and the participant.
Our intuition is that, if acandidate trigger and participant are far away fromeach other, it is less likely that they characterize anevent.2.2.3 Dependency Relation FeaturesA dependency parse tree captures the semanticpredicate-argument dependencies among the wordsof a sentence.
Dependency tree paths between pro-tein pairs have successfully been used to identify112protein interactions (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007;Erkan et al, 2007).
In this paper, we use thedependency paths to extract events.
For a giventrigger/participant pair, we extract the shortest pathfrom the trigger to the participant, from the depen-dency parse of the sentence.
We use the McClosky-Charniak parses which are converted to the Stan-ford Typed Dependencies format and provided to theparticipants by the shared task organizers.
Previousapproaches use both the words and the dependencyrelation types to represent the paths (Bunescu andMooney, 2007; Erkan et al, 2007).
Consider the de-pendency tree in Figure 1.
The path from ?phospho-rylation?
to ?CD40?
is ?nsubj inhibits acomp bind-ing prep to domain num?.
Due to the large num-ber of possible words, using the words on the pathsmight lead to data sparsity problems and to poorgeneralization.
Suppose we have a sentence withsimilar semantics, where the synonym word ?pre-vents?
is used instead of ?inhibits?.
If we use thewords on the path to represent the path feature, weend up with two different paths for the two sen-tences that have similar semantics.
Therefore, inthis study we use only the dependency relation typesamong the words to represent the paths.
For ex-ample, the path feature extracted for the (phospho-rylation, CD40) negative trigger/participant pair is?nsubj acomp prep to num?
and the path feature ex-tracted for the (phosphorylation, TRAF2) positivetrigger/participant pair is ?prep of?.inhibitsphosphorylation bindingTRAF2 domaincytoplasmic CD40 theacompprep_of prep_toamod detnumnsubjFigure 1: The dependency tree of the sentence ?The phos-phorylation of TRAF2 inhibits binding to the CD40 cyto-plasmic domain.
?2.3 ClassificationWe used the SVM light library (Joachims, 1999)with two different kernel functions and feature setsfor learning the classification models.
Our first ap-proach is based on using linear SVM with the fea-tures described in Section 2.2.
In this approachthe path feature is used as a nominal feature.
Oursecond approach is based on integrating to SVM akernel function based on the word-based edit dis-tance between the dependency relation paths, whereeach dependency relation type on the path is treatedas a word.
For example, the word-based edit dis-tance between the paths ?prep of?
and ?prep ofprep with?
is 1, since 1 insertion operation (i.e., in-serting ?prep with?
to the first path) is sufficient totransform the first path to the second one.
The edit-distance based similarity between two paths pi andpj and the corresponding kernel function are definedas follows (Erkan et al, 2007).edit sim(pi, pj) = e??
(edit distance(pi,pj)) (1)3 Experimental ResultsThe data provided for the shared task is preparedfrom the GENIA corpus (Kim et al, 2008).
We usedthe training and the development sets for training.The candidate triggers are detected by using a dic-tionary based approach, where the dictionary is ex-tracted from the training set.
We filtered out thenoisy trigger candidates such as ?with?, ?+?, ?
:?, and?-?, which are rarely used as real triggers and com-monly used in other contexts.
The candidate trig-ger/participant pairs are classified by using the clas-sifiers learned for Class 1, Class 2, and/or Class 3depending on whether the candidate trigger matchedone of the triggers in these classes.
The SVM scoreis used to disambiguate the event types, if a candi-date trigger matches a trigger in more than one of theevent classes.
A trigger which is ambiguous amongthe event types in the same class is assigned to theevent type for which it is most frequently used as atrigger.The results that we submitted to the shared taskwere obtained by using the linear SVM approachwith the set of features described in Section 2.2.After submitting the results, we noticed that wemade an error in pre-processing the data set.
Whilealigning the provided dependency parses with the113sentence, we incorrectly assumed that all the sen-tences had dependency parses and ended up usingthe wrong dependency parses for most of the sen-tences.
The overall performance scores for our of-ficial submission are 30.42% recall, 14.11% preci-sion, and 19.28% F-measure.
The results obtainedafter correcting the error are reported in Table 1.Correcting the error significantly improved the per-formance of the system.
Table 2 shows the re-sults obtained by using SVM with dependency pathedit kernel.
The two SVM models achieve similarperformances.
The performance for the regulationevents is considerably lower, since errors in identi-fying the events are carried to identifying the eventparticipants of a regulation event.
The performancesfor the events which have multiple participants, i.e.,binding and regulation events, are lower comparedto the events with a single participant.
The perfor-mance is higher when computed by decomposingthe events (49.00 and 31.82 F-measure for bindingand regulation events, respectively).
This suggeststhat even when participants of events are identifiedcorrectly, there is significant amount of error in com-posing the events.Event Type Recall Precision F-measureLocalization 41.95 60.83 49.66Binding 31.41 34.94 33.08Gene expression 61.36 69.00 64.96Transcription 37.23 30.72 33.66Protein catabolism 64.29 64.29 64.29Phosphorylation 68.15 80.70 73.90Event Total 50.82 56.80 53.64Regulation 15.12 19.82 17.15Positive regulation 24.21 33.33 28.05Negative regulation 21.64 32.93 26.11Regulation Total 22.02 30.72 25.65All Total 35.86 44.69 39.79Table 1: Approximate span & recursive matching resultsusing linear SVM with the set of features described inSection 2.2 (after correcting the error in pre-processingthe data set).4 ConclusionWe described a supervised approach to extract bio-molecular events.
