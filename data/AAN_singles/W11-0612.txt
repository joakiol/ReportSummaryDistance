In thispaper, however, we apply survival analysis toeye movement data in order to model the sur-vival function of fixation time distributions inreading.
Semiparametric regression modelingand novel evaluation methods for probabilis-tic models of eye movements are presented.Survival models adjusting for the influence oflinguistic and cognitive effects are shown toreduce prediction error within a critical timeperiod, roughly between 150 and 250 ms fol-lowing fixation onset.1 IntroductionDuring reading, the eyes move on average four timesper second with substantial variation in individualfixation times, reflecting, at least in part, momentarychanges in on-line language processing demands.In psycholinguistics, it is commonly assumed thatderivative measures of fixation times, such as firstfixation duration and gaze duration, reflect cognitiveprocesses during reading.
It is less clear, however,how the distribution of individual fixation times inreading is affected by on-line processing activities.In eye movement oriented research, models that at-tempt to model the distribution of individual fix-ation times in reading typically assume that sac-cadic movements are executed relatively randomlyin time, with cognition only occasionally influenc-ing the timing of saccades (Feng, 2006; McConkieet al, 1994; Yang and McConkie, 2001; Yang,2006).
In the model by Yang and McConkie (2001),for example, it is assumed that cognitive controlcan have a direct influence over the timing of sac-cades only with very long fixations, after the normalsaccade has been canceled due to processing diffi-culty.
Distributional models have often made useof the hazard function in order to analyze fixationtimes in reading (Feng, 2006; Feng, 2009; Yang andMcConkie, 2001).
The hazard function, in generalterms, is a function of time representing the instan-taneous risk that an event (e.g., a saccade) will occurat some specified time t given that it has not occurredprior to time t.In this paper, we model the distribution of fixa-tion times in terms of a different but related quan-tity, namely the survival function, which defines theprobability of being alive, i.e., the probability of theevent not having occurred, at some specified timet.
We use semiparametric regression for modelingthe influence of linguistic and cognitive effects onthe survival function, and we assess the results us-ing survival-based time-dependent evaluation met-rics.
More specifically, our objectives are as follows.We first estimate the survival functions for ten differ-ent readers using the Kaplan-Meier method (Kaplanand Meier, 1958) in order to establish the generalshape of the survival function for reading time data.Then, we estimate adjusted survival functions usingCox proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) in or-der to examine the influence of stimulus variableson survival.
Finally, we assess the adjusted survivalmodels both with respect to the estimated effects ofcovariates and with respect to the predictive perfor-107mance on held out data.
The experiments we reportin this paper are based on first fixation data (multi-ple refixations discarded) from the English sectionof the Dundee Corpus of eye movements in reading(Kennedy and Pynte, 2005).The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-lows.
Section 2 introduces survival analysis andfurther motivates its use for modeling fixation du-rations in reading.
Section 3 introduces and appliesthe Kaplan-Meier estimate, to compare the survivalfunctions for the different readers in the corpus.Section 4 introduces the Cox proportional hazardsmodel and section 5 outlines two methods for assess-ing the performance of survival models on new data.Section 6 presents the experimental evaluation of us-ing Cox proportional hazards to model the survivalfunction and summarize and discuss the results.
Sec-tion 7, finally, concludes this paper.2 BackgroundSurvival analysis is the study and modeling of thetime it takes for events to occur.
Because methodsfor survival analysis originally were developed forstudying the lifetime distributions of humans in anepidemiological context, the prototypical event inthese studies is death and the primary variable of in-terest thus time until death occurs.
The use of sur-vival analysis, however, reaches beyond the clinicaland medical sciences and survival methods apply toany study with a naturally identifiable starting pointand a well-defined event of interest as end point.
Innon-medical contexts, survival analysis often goesby other names, such as failure time analysis or re-liability analysis in engineering applications, eventhistory analysis in sociology, or simply durationanalysis in yet other contexts.A defining characteristic of survival analysis is theability to deal with censoring in a principled manner.Censoring is said to occur when only partial infor-mation about the survival time of an individual (hu-man or other) is available.
The most common typeof censoring is referred to as right-censoring, whichoccurs when an individual is not subject to the eventof interest during the course of the observation pe-riod.
In this case, it is only known that the individualdid not experience the event prior to the end of thestudy, but may perhaps do so at a later point in timeand this piece of partial information about the cen-sored survival time is included in the analysis.There are, however, potentially good reasons forusing survival analysis even in time-to-event studiesthat do not necessarily involve censored data, suchas when measuring the brief periods of time elaps-ing between a stimulus appearance and a button-press in response-time studies, or when measuringthe time between one saccade and the next duringreading using eye-tracking.
Such data is usually notnormally distributed and even in the absence of cen-soring one may take advantage of the fact that sur-vival data is almost never assumed to be normallydistributed and the methods of survival analysis aredesigned to reflect this.
Furthermore, if the correctparametric model for the data is not known, or one isnot confident enough that a given parametric modelis appropriate, the Cox proportional hazards modelprovides a robust1 and widely used semiparametricregression method for time-to-event data.
With re-spect to eye movement data, the Cox model appearsappealing because, as pointed out by Feng (2006,2009), several different types of distributions havebeen proposed as models of fixation times in readingat one time or another, suggesting there is indeed lit-tle agreement with respect to the correct parametricmodel.2.1 Survival and HazardSurvival data is commonly analyzed and modeled interms of the survival and the hazard function.The survival function describes the probabilisticrelationship between survival and time.

The survival function, S(t), definesthe probability that the individual survives longerthan some specified time t:S(t) = P (T > t) (1)The survival function is a monotonically decreas-ing function heading downward as t increases andhas the following theoretical properties: S(0) = 1,the probability of surviving past time 0 is 1; andS(?)

Notice also thatif F (t) is the cumulative distribution function for T ,the survival function, S(t), is 1?
F (t).In the present study, we let the event of interestbe the occurrence of a saccade following a fixationperiod, and the most reasonable starting point forour measurements, at least in practice, appears to bethe beginning, or the onset, of the fixation period.We will refer to the period onset-to-saccade inter-changeably as the fixation time or the survival time.Thus, in this context, the survival function S(t) sim-ply expresses the probability that a given fixationlasts, or survives, longer than some specified timet.The hazard function, h(t), gives the instantaneouspotential, per unit time, for an event to occur in somesmall time interval after t, given survival up to timet:h(t) = lim?t?0P (t ?
T < t+ ?t | T ?
t)?t(2)The conditional probability in the formula for thehazard function expresses the probability that thesurvival time, T , will lie in the time interval betweent and t + ?t, given that the survival time is greaterthan or equal to t, where ?t denotes an infinitesi-mally small interval of time.
As already suggested,in this study the hazard function represents the in-stantaneous risk, or hazard, of a saccade occurringfollowing a fixation at some specified time t, giventhat it has not yet occurred.3 Kaplan-Meier Survival EstimateThe survival function for time-to-event data can beestimated from a sample of survival times, both cen-sored and uncensored, using the Kaplan-Meier (akaProduct-Limit) method.
This is a non-parametricestimate of the survival function which orders thesurvival times, from the shortest to the longest, andadjusts, for each of the event times, the number ofcases still alive according to the number of casesthat were either subject to the event or censored inthe previous time period.Let dj be the number of saccades that occur attime tj , and let nj be the number of fixations forwhich no saccade has yet occurred at time tj .
TheKaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function S(t)is then given by:S?
(t) =?t(j)?t(1?djnj) (3)In the absence of censored observations, the Kaplan-Meier estimate is equivalent to the empirical dis-tribution, and the cumulative survival probability attime tj reduces to the number of surviving fixationsat time tj divided by the total number of fixations inthe sample.
The value of S?
(t) is constant betweenevent times and the estimated function is therefore astep function that changes value only at times whenone or more saccades occur.3.1 Kaplan-Meier Survival of Reading DataFeng (2009) estimated the hazard function for thedistribution of fixation times for the readers of theDundee corpus.
Here, we give a complementaryaccount by estimating the corresponding survivalfunction for these readers using the Kaplan-Meiermethod.
Figure 1 shows the survival functions foreach reader plotted against time.
Individual differ-ences in the survival function emerge soon after 50ms and at 100 ms we can spot different tendencieswith respect to how fast or slow the curves decline.Overall, however, the behavior of the survival func-tion appears similar across readers.
Typically, thesurvival function begins with a slow decline up untilabout 150 ms and is then followed by a very rapiddecline during the next 100 ms.
Thus, we can seein figure 1 that the overall survival rates drop fromabout 80% to 20% in the time interval 150-250 ms.Thereafter, the function flattens again and at about400 ms it appears to be converging between the read-ers.
It is worth noting, however, that the reliabilityof the estimate decreases with time since the numberof surviving fixations becomes fewer and fewer.Median survival time is the point in time when50% of the total number of fixations has been termi-nated by a saccade.
It is thus read off the plot as thetime where the probability of survival is 0.5.
Mediansurvival time ranges from 168 ms (reader g) to 220ms (reader b).
Mean median survival time across allten readers is 191.4 ms with a standard deviation of14.9 ms.1090.00.20.40.60.81.0Time (ms)Probabilityofsurvivalsasbscsdsesfsgshsisj0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier curves for fixation durations showing the cumulative survival probability, following fixationonset, grouped by individual reader (subject a-j).4 Cox Proportional Hazards ModelThis section introduces the Cox proportional haz-ards model.
We will later apply this model in theexperimental part of the paper to obtain adjusted es-timates of the survival function for the readers in theDundee corpus.The Cox proportional hazards model is a semi-parametric regression model for survival data relat-ing survival time to one or more predictors or co-variates.
More precisely, the Cox model regressesthe hazard function on a set of predictors, providingestimates of their effects in terms of hazard ratios.The Cox proportional hazards model has the follow-ing form:h(t) = h0(t) exp{?1x1 + ?2x2 + .
.
.+ ?nxn} (4)where h0(t) is the baseline hazard function at time t,x1 .
.
.
xn are the set of covariates or predictor vari-ables, and ?1 .
.
.
?n are the corresponding coeffi-cients to be estimated2.
Thus, this model gives anexpression for the hazard at time t for a particularindividual with a given set of covariates.The baseline hazard, h0(t), represents the valueof the hazard function when all covariates are equalto zero, and in the Cox model this baseline haz-ard is left unspecified and varies as a function oftime.
Since no assumptions are made with respect2Parameter estimates in the Cox model are obtained by max-imizing the ?partial?
likelihood, as opposed to the (full) likeli-hood.
Details of procedures for parameter estimation can befound, for example, in Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980).to the form or distribution of the baseline hazard,this can be regarded as the nonparametric part of theCox proportional hazards model.
However, the Coxmodel assumes a parametric form with respect to theeffect of the predictors on the hazard.
In particu-lar, as seen in equation 4, the predictors are assumedto multiply hazard at any point in time.
This is animportant assumption of the Cox model referred toas the assumption of proportional hazards.
It meansthat the hazard functions for any two individuals atany point in time should be proportional.
In otherwords, if a certain individual has a risk of the event atsome initial point in time that is twice as high as thatof another individual, then, under the proportionalhazards assumption the risk remains twice as highalso at all later times.
There are a variety of differentgraphical and goodness-of-fit based procedures thatcan be used to evaluate the proportional hazards as-sumption for survival data (see Kleinbaum and Klein(2005) for an overview.
).The parameter estimates in a fitted Cox model arecommonly interpreted in terms of their hazard ra-tios.
If bi is the value of the coefficient for predictorxi, the exponentiated coefficient, ebi , gives the esti-mated hazard ratio for xi.
For continuous variables,the hazard ratio refers to the risk change associatedwith one unit increase in xi, controlling for the effectof the other variables.
A hazard ratio above one indi-cates a raised risk of the event occurring and the pre-dictor is in this case thus negatively associated withsurvival.
Correspondingly, a value below one indi-110cates a decreased risk and the predictor is thus posi-tively associated with survival.
Lastly, if the hazardratio is equal to one, there is no indication of anyassociated risk change.5 Assessment of Survival ModelsAccurate prognoses are of critical importance inmany areas where survival analysis apply, for in-stance in medical contexts where doctors have to es-timate the expected remaining life time for termi-nally ill patients.
Survival models are thus often as-sessed with respect to their predictive performanceon novel data, in addition to the statistical signifi-cance of model covariates.
We now briefly reviewtwo of the most commonly used measures for as-sessing the quality of survival models on indepen-dent data sets.5.1 Prediction Error CurvesThe prediction error for survival data is defined as afunction of time and can be measured by the Brierscore (Brier, 1950).
Intuitively, if an individual isalive at time t, the predicted survival probabilityshould be close to 1, and otherwise close to 0.
Theprediction error, or Brier score, at time point t isdefined as the mean squared error between the ob-served survival status Yi(t) for the individual i attime t, which is equal to 1 if the individual is alive att, and 0 otherwise, and the predicted survival proba-bility for i at time t:B?S(t) =1nn?i=1{Yi(t)?
Si(t)}2 (5)The lower the Brier score, the lower the predic-tion error.
Various benchmark values for the Brierscore at time t exists.
The values 0.25 and 0.33,for example, correspond to a constant predicted sur-vival probability of 50% and to a randomly pre-dicted value between 0 and 1, respectively.
Often,however, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survivalfunction over the training sample is used.
In thiscase, the benchmark prediction at time point t cor-responds to the proportion of individuals survivingpast t, thus ignoring all available covariate informa-tion.
By tracking the prediction error over time weget the prediction error curve (Graf et al, 1999) anda summary measure of the error for the whole ob-servation period can be obtained by integrating overtime (the integrated Brier score).5.2 Concordance IndexThe concordance index (Harrell et al, 1982), or C-index, estimates the probability that a given predic-tion agrees, or concurs, with the observed outcome.For uncensored data, the concordance index is givenby the relative frequency of concordant pairs amongall pairs of individuals.
A pair is said to be concor-dant if the individual with the shorter survival timeis also predicted by the model to have the highestrisk of the two.
Useful reference values for the con-cordance index are 0.5 which indicates that the pre-dictions are no better than chance, and 1 which indi-cates that the model discriminates the pairs perfectly.6 Experimental EvaluationIn order to study the influence of cognitive and lin-guistic effects on the survival function, the followingexperiment is performed.
First, the Cox proportionalhazards model is used to regress fixation times onfive different stimulus variables associated with thecurrent fixation, thus providing estimates of the haz-ard ratios for the effects of each variable adjusted forthe other variables in the model.
Second, we obtainadjusted survival functions, i.e.
survival curves thatadjust for the stimulus variables used as covariates,and we assess these curves with respect to the gen-eralization error on held-out corpus data.It is worth pointing out that regression studies onthe Dundee Corpus of eye movements have beencarried out before (e.g., Demberg and Keller, 2008;Pynte and Kennedy, 2006).
Our experiment, how-ever, differs from previous studies in at least threeways: (1) our goal is to model the survival func-tion of fixation time distributions in reading, whichmeans that we use the survival time of individual fix-ations as the unit of analysis; (2) we assess the sur-vival model not only with respect to the estimatedregression coefficients, but also with respect to themodels?
predictive performance on unseen data; (3)we use a semiparametric regression method for sur-vival data which has not been previously applied,as far as we know, to reading-time data.
It is alsoworth pointing out that although we believe that a111Table 1: Results of Cox proportional hazards model of fixation times in the Dundee Corpus section 01-16: hazardratios (HR) and significance levels (p) for all covariates in the model, and for each individual model of reader a-j.a b c d e f g h i jVariable HR p HR p HR p HR p HR p HR p HR p HR p HR p HR pWord length 1.015 < .001 0.983 < .001 0.979 < .001 0.988 < .001 0.992 < .05 0.992 < .01 0.992 < .01 0.985 < .001 0.990 < .01 0.987 < .001Word frequency 1.055 < .001 1.042 < .001 1.036 < .001 1.051 < .001 1.051 < .001 1.014 < .001 1.031 < .001 1.028 < .001 1.040 < .001 1.044 < .001Bigram probability 1.108 < .001 1.196 < .1 1.092 < .05 1.006 < .01 1.013 < .05 1.014 < .001 0.953 1.011 < .001 1.003 1.005 < .05Surprisal 1.001 0.986 < .001 0.994 < .01 0.984 < .001 0.998 < .01 0.991 < .05 1.002 0.994 0.993 < .05 0.996 < .01Entropy 0.966 < .001 0.986 < .01 0.980 < .001 0.988 < .01 0.963 < .001 1.002 0.990 < .05 0.992 < .05 0.969 < .001 0.978 < .001careful comparison of the results obtained using sur-vival analysis to those reported for other regressionmethods would be useful and interesting, it is never-theless beyond the scope of this paper.Most of the stimulus variables included in theanalysis have been shown to correlate with readingtimes in other regression studies: the number of let-ters in the word, the logarithm of the word?s rela-tive frequency (based on occurrences in the BritishNational Corpus), the logarithm of the conditional(bigram) probability of the word (based on occur-rences in the Google Web 1T 5-gram corpus (Brantsand Franz, 2006)), the syntactic surprisal and en-tropy scores3 (computed here using the probabilis-tic PCFG parser by Roark et al (2009)).
The sur-prisal (Hale, 2001) at word wi refers to the nega-tive log probability of wi given the preceding words,computed using the prefix probabilities of the parser.A number of studies have previously established apositive relation between surprisal and word-readingtimes (Boston et al, 2008; Demberg and Keller,2008; Roark et al, 2009).
The entropy, as quantifiedhere, approximates the structural uncertainty associ-ated with the rest of the sentence, or what is yet tobe computed (Roark et al, 2009).In this experiment, we use the first 16 texts inthe Dundee corpus for parameter estimation, and thefollowing two texts, 17 and 18 for model assessmentof the generalization error.
To avoid introducing bi-ases that may result from pooling distributional datatogether, we model each of the readers in the cor-pus separately.
Prior to running the experiments,we also validated the Cox proportional hazards as-sumption using a goodness-of-fit approach based onthe Schoenfeld residuals (Schoenfeld, 1982).
Theoutcome of this test indicated a slight violation of3To ease interpretation of the estimated hazard ratios, no in-teraction terms were included in this model.the proportional hazards assumption.
However, itis well-known that a slight violation may occur forlarge data samples, given that p-values can be drivenby sample size (Kleinbaum and Klein, 2005).6.1 Results6.1.1 Hazard RatiosTable 1 shows the results of the Cox proportionalhazards regression models.
The estimated hazard ra-tio for each covariate along with the correspondingsignificance level is reported for each reader.
Recallthat a hazard ratio above one indicates a worse sur-vival prognosis, i.e.
shorter fixation times, while ahazard ratio below one indicates better survival, i.e.longer fixation times.Overall, the effects go in the directions expectedfor these variables based on previous research.There is a significant positive effect of word lengthon survival for all but one reader.
The hazard ra-tio for the significant effects ranges between 0.979and 0.992.
Word length thus decreases the hazard byabout 1-2% for each additional letter in a word whenadjusting for the effects of the other covariates inthe model.
Word frequency is significantly and neg-atively related to survival across all readers.
Morefrequent words have shorter survival times.
The av-erage hazard ratio among the readers is 1.0392 andthe estimated risk of a saccade increases thus on av-erage by a factor of 1.0392 for each unit increasein log word frequency.
Bigram probability is nega-tively and significantly related to survival for eightreaders with an average hazard ratio of 1.0569.
Sur-prisal is significantly and positively related to sur-vival for seven readers.
Among these, the hazarddecreases by 1% for each unit increase in surprisal.Entropy has a significant and positive effect on sur-vival on all but one readers.

While Frank (2010) recently showed that sen-tence entropy, i.e.
non-structural entropy, accountsfor a significant fraction of the variance in readingtimes, our results provide additional support for theinfluence of structural sentence entropy on readingtimes.
Moreover, it is noteworthy that the effect ofentropy appears reliably robust in individual first fix-ation times, suggesting that the effects of structuralprocessing demands can be immediate rather thandelayed in the eye movement record.6.1.2 Adjusted SurvivalWe summarize the results of the evaluation of theadjusted survival function on held-out data in table2 and in table 3.
Table 2 shows the Brier score com-puted at different points in time in the interval 100to 300 ms.
Results are reported both for the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function and for thefitted Cox-models.
We present the results for eachindividual model.
The bottom row gives the resultsobtained when averaging over all models at the spec-ified time t.Recall that the Brier score, or prediction error,at any specified time t, is computed over all fixa-tions in the held-out set and gives the average of thesquared distances between the actual survival statusand the predicted survival probability at time t. Al-though the differences between the Cox-model andthe Kaplan-Meier estimate are small overall, thereare two subtle but notable results.
First, the ad-justed survival model is never underperforming theKaplan-Meier survival estimate.
The prediction er-ror of the Cox model is consistently lower or equal tothe Kaplan-Meier prediction error at each time pointand for each reader.
Second, in comparison to theKaplan-Meier error, the prediction error of the ad-justed model is systematically lower in the time win-dow 150-250 ms, but essentially the same prior to,and after, this time period.
This is readily reflectedin the average scores, for example.
One interpre-tation of these small but systematic differences sug-gests that there is a limited period, approximately noearlier than 150 ms. and no later than 250 ms. on av-erage, during which the covariates in the model areprimarily influencing the survival time.
Before andafter this period, the stimulus variables of the fixatedword appear to have little or no influence on the timewhen saccades are generated.
In other words, we ob-serve an improved agreement to the observed data inthe interval 150-250 ms. under the assumption thateach individual fixation has an independent survivalfunction whose value at time t is influenced by thespecific values for the stimulus variables of the fix-ation.
Recall that the benchmark, the Kaplan-Meierestimate, in contrast, assumes one and the same un-derlying survival function for all fixations, ignoringall available covariate information.

Figure 2 shows, as an example, the predictionerror curve for one of the models.Table 3 gives the integrated brier score, i.e., theprediction error obtained when integrating over allevent times, and the concordance index C, forboth the Kaplan-Meier estimate and the Cox model.These results are averaged over the results of the in-dividual models.
The integrated Brier score verifiesthat the Cox model fares somewhat better, althoughthe impact of the model variables appears limited intime.
The C-value for both the Kaplan-Meier andthe Cox model is significantly better than chance(0.5).
A C-value of 0.6 - 0.7 is a common resultfor survival data.7 ConclusionIn this paper we applied survival analysis to modelfixation times in reading.
In particular, we modeledthe survival function of fixation time distributionsusing the Kaplan-Meier estimate, and the Cox pro-portional hazards model to adjust for cognitive andlinguistic effects on survival.
The adjusted survivalmodels were assessed with respect to the effect ofcovariates on hazard rates, and with respect to theirpredictive performance using evaluation metrics thatare novel in the context of eye-movement and psy-cholinguistic modeling.The results of the analysis suggests that: (1) struc-tural sentence entropy influences survival, i.e., in-creasing structural uncertainty about the rest of thesentence decreases the risk of moving the eyes; (2)stimulus variables associated with the current fixa-tion influence the survival of the fixation in a limitedtime frame, roughly between 150 and 250 ms fol-lowing onset; and (3) linguistic and cognitive effectsmay influence the timing of saccades earlier than issometimes assumed.Looking ahead, important topics to be inves-tigated in the future include frailty models andcompeting risks survival analysis.
Frailty modelsare survival-based regression models with randomeffects, designed to account for variance due toindividual-level factors otherwise unaccounted for.114Competing risks survival analysis apply to situationswhere a finite number of different types of events arepossible, but only one of the events can actually oc-cur per individual, e.g., dying from either lung can-cer or stroke.
In the current study we did not dif-ferentiate between different types of events follow-ing a fixation.
A competing risks analysis, however,would let us differentiate between different types ofsaccades and study the influence of predictors on thesurvival function based on the type of the saccadefollowing a fixation, e.g., whether it is a forward-directed saccade, refixation or regression.
These andother issues will be addressed.ReferencesMarisa F. Boston, John Hale, Reinhold Kliegl, UmeshPatil, and Shravan Vasishth.
