!Deriving Metonymic Coercions from WordNetSanda M. HarabagiuArtificial Intelligence CenterSRI International333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Park, CA 94025harabagi@ai.sri.comAbstractThis paper presents a method for derivingmetonymic oercions from the knowledge availablein WordNet.
Two different classes of metonymies areinferred by using (1) lexico-semantic connections be-tween concepts or (2) morphological cues and logicalformulae defining lexical concepts.
In both cases thederivation of metonymic paths is based on approx-imations of sortal constraints retrieved from Word-Net.This novel method of inferring coercions validatesthe related knowledge through coreference links.
Asa result, metonymic coercions are potentially usefulfor the recognition of coreferring entities in informa-tion extraction systems.1 Problem descriptionThe pervasive phenomenon of metonymy raises aproblem for the interpretation of real-world texts.Metonymies are figures of speech in which, accordingto the literature definition from (Lakoff and John-son, 1990), "one entity is used to refer to another,that is related to it".
Characteristic of a metonymicreading of a textual expression is the fact that thesatisfaction of sortal constraints guides the coercionto related knowledge.The comprehensive account of the semantics ofmeaning transfers presented in (Nunberg, 1995) in-dicates that coercions need to be embedded in aconceptual and lexico-semantic space, ideally pro-vided by a linguistic knowledge base.
Nunberg alsonotes that coercions are licensed by pragmatic ir-cumstances, pecifically pertaining to the Griceanprinciples (Grice, 1975).In this paper, we revisit the notion of metonymyand address the computational spects of its res-olution in the context of the relational seman-tics provided by the recently released WordNet 1.6lexical database (www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn ).Following the lessons learned from the WordNet-based inference of Gricean implicatures, reported in(Harabagiu et al, 1996), anovel methodology ofpro-ducing metonymic paths was devised.The coercions combine WordNet relations with st'-142mantic information derived from conceptual defini-tions.
In WordNet (Miller, 1995) synony m wordsare structured in synsets, underlying a linguisticconcept.
Every synset is associated with a gloss,representing a textual definition, that can be trans-lated in a logical form following the notation intro-duced in (Hobbs, 1986-1).
This formalism, used inthe implementation f TACITUS (Hobbs, 1986-2), ac-commodates a large variety of discourse inferencesand, moreover, provides an elegant manner of local-izing ambiguities, as was shown in (Bear and Hobbs,1988).Conceptual support from linguistic knowledgebases was already considered in the implementationof several metonymy resolution systems (e.g.
(Mark-err and Hahn, 1997), (Fass, 1991) (Hobbs.
1986-2)),but none of these systems provided with more in-ferential flexibility than the typical coercion classesformulated by Lakoff (Lakoff and Johnson, 1990).We propose here a metonymy resolution approachthat accounts for an open class of coercions.
Simi-larly to Nunberg (Nunberg, 1995) and more recentlyto Markert and Hahn (Markert and Hahn, 1997), wefind metonymy and nominal reference resolution tobe two interacting processes; therefore, the proposedcomputational model validates metonymies throughcoreference links.2 Classes of metonymic oercionsStallard proposed in (Stallard, 1993) a distinctionbetween two kinds of metonymy: (1) referentialraetonymy, in which the referent of a nominal pred-icate argument requires coercion and (2) predica-tive metonymy, featuring the coercion of the pred-icate usually corresponding to a verbal lexicaliza-tion.
In his study, Stallard focuses on metonymicinferences required by a specific performative con-text, characterized by wh-questions and impera-tives.
His formalization of referential and predica-tive metonymies i  based on the logical form read-ings of utterances from the DARPA ATIS (Air TravelInformation Service) domain (MADCOW.
1992), aquestion-answering database about commercial airflights, comprising questions of the form:IIIIIIIIiIIIIIIIIII(QI) Vhich wide-body jets serve dinner?
(Q2) Which airlines fly from Boston to Denver?The ATIS domain is characterized by a pre-established formal system of categories and relationsonto which the utterances must be mapped.
In thisdomain it is known that only flights fly or servemeals; thus, both (Q1) and (Q2) can only be un-derstood metonymically.
The interpretation of theATT$ utterances is performed in the logical languageimposed by the implementation in the DELPHI sys-tem (Bobrow et al, 1991).
In this framework, aquestion is translated into a LISP-expression:(wh x S (and (PI x) (P2 x) )interpreted as a query for all members of S (the se-mantic lass of the wh-NP) that satisfy both PI (de-fined as the modifiers of the wh-NP) and P2 (thepredicate of the clause).
For exemplification, (qLFi)and (0LF2) represent the logical form translations of(QI) and (Q2)t:(QLFI) (whx flights(and (exists y jets(and (aircraft-of x y)(.ide-bodyy))(serve flight-ofx meal-of dinner)))(QLF2) (wh x airlines(exists y flights(and (airline-of y x)(fly flight-of yorig-o~ Bostondest -o f  Denver ) ) ) )In the case of (QLFI), the coercion relationa i rc ra f t -o f  maps between flights and the aircraftsthey are on, whereas in the case of (QLF2), the co-ercion relation a i r l ine-of  translates the connec-tion between airlines and flights.
Although both(QLFI) and (qLF2) have an interpolated quantifierfor flights, which is not specified in the utterance, thedifference comes from the position of the variable: inthe case of (QLF1), the interpolated variable x is thewh-variahle, whereas in the case of (QLF2), the in-terpolated variable y is part of the description thatshould be returned by the query.
Stallard notes thatthis is the crux of the referential/predicative distinc-tion of metonymies.In (0LFt), the NP-argument je ts  does not rep-resent the domain of the wh-variable, but f l ight;does, thus indicating a metonymic reference andderiving a referential metonymy reading.
In con-trast, in (QLF2) the domain of the wh-variable co-incides with the semantic type from the utterance(i.e., airlines), but the subject-argument of thef ly predicate is replaced by the coercion f l ights .This prompts Stallard to state that "predicativeI (Or), (Q2), ({~LFt) and (qLF2) are borrowed from (StaJ-lard, 1993)143metonymy can be loosely thought of as coercion ofa predicate place, rather than that of the argumentNP itself".We argue that this definition is dependent ontwo factors: (1) the specific logical transforma-tion imposed by the DELPHI implementation, whichdoes not cover forms of utterances other than wh-questions, and (2) the availability of thematic rolerelations and coercions tailored specifically for theATIS domain.
This characterization of referen-tial/predicative metonymies is not applicable whenprocessing different genres of text, operating in dif-ferent domains and, thus needing a different knowl-edge representation.
An example ofa metonymy res-olution system using a more general representationis reported (Markert and Hahn, 1997).In their model of metonymy inference, Markertand Hahn employ a two-tiered conceptual and se-mantic test: conceptual checks identify well-formedrole chains between a pair of syntactically linked con-cepts, and then semantic checks distinguish whetherthese chains mirror literal or metonymic relation-ships.
To perform these checks, they use (1) aconcept hierarchy C with a taxonomic relation isacand (2) a set of relation names 7~, containing la-bels of all conceptual roles of the elements from C,hierarchically organized by isa~.
For the ATIS do-main, we can assume C = {AIRLINE, JET, MEAL,PASSENGER, PILOT .
.
.
.  }
and 7~ -- {has-aircraft,has-flight, property-of' serves, fly-from, fly-to .
.
.
.
}.To be able to parse texts, Markert and Hahn de-vised a system that grants a syntactic link betweentwo concepts z and y if there is an acyclic path ofrelations ri E 7~ and concepts cj E C such that eachri is a conceptual role of ci-t,  with ra,lge(ri)= ciand co = z A (c, isac.
y V y isao ca).Following established classifications (Lakoff andJohnson, 1990), Markert and Hahn predefine someof the relations from ~ as metonymic.
These rela-tions are {has-part, part-of, produced-by, contained-in, made-of}.
Thus, a metonymy is recognizedwhenever one of the relations ri from a path ismetonymic.In this framework, the interpretation of the re-lation between x =a i r l ine  and y =dinner in(Q1) is rendered by the Path-l: c0--company(with z"=airline-isa-~company), rt-'has-part, ct=employee (with flight-attendant-isa-+ employeeand range (serve, SUBJECT) = flight-attendant),r2=serve, c3=meal (with y--dinner-isa-+meal).Similarly, the interpretation f the conceptual relat-edness between r - -a i r l ine and y=Boston in (Q2)is rendered by the Path-2: co=airline, rt=has-flight, cl=scheduled-flight, r2=arrive-at, c3=city(with y--Boston-isa-~city).The presence of rl=has-part in Path-I and ofrt=has-flight in Path-2 indicates that the two!I!
!paths correspond to metonymic readings.
Relationhas-flight is not among the predefined metonymicrelations considered by Markert and Hahn, butclearly would need to be so, to classify Path-2as metonymic.
Moreover, as a distinction on thepredicate coercions, Path-1 contains the relationrz---serve, identical to the wh-predicate of (Ol),indicating that it is not a predicative metonymy.The referential metonymy from Path-1 is determinedby the metonymic relation rl=has-part, coercingairline to flight attendants.
In contrast, Path-2 has relation r2-arrive-at that coerces the wh-predicate fly-to from ({~2).Markert and Hahn do not analyze the seman-tics of the metonymic paths, but instead distinguishreferential and predicative metonyrnies only in theanaphoric cases.
Considering that expression A is ametonymic coercion of the concept B, they assumethat in the predicative case A should be availablefor reference resolution, whereas in the referentialcase, only B should be so.
To be able to assessthe availability for reference resolution, they searchfor the presence of A and B in the list of forward-looking centers of the previous sentences (thus usingthe functional centering framework defined in (Groszet al, 1995)).A similar path-finding methodology for derivingmetonymies was used by the met* system (Fass,1991), in which connections between the senseframes of textual concepts are retrieved from a lex-icon of the size of 500 word senses.
These pathsare then classified against a small set of predefinedmetonymic inference rules, and form the grounds forthe figurative interpretation of textual expressions.In met* there is no support for distinctions betweenpredicative and referential metonymies, since coer-cions are possible from any concept in a text.
Theappeal of this implementation stems from the factthat it uses word sense frames, inspired by the struc-ture of dictionary entries and shows that the pathsretrieved from such a knowledge representation canbe used to identify classical forms of metonymy.This indicates that metonymy resolution can be per-formed by processing knowledge from lexical dictio-naries, and therefore WordNet 1.6 is a suitable can-didate.A different methodology of deriving coercionswas implemented in TACITUS (Hobbs et al, 1993).Whenever sortal constraints are violated, explicit ar-guments are replaced with coercion variables, relatedto the explicit arguments by generic relations.
Thecoercion is devised when the generic relation sub-sumes some predicate that is brought forward bythe abductive interpretation f the text.
In the caseof (Q1), argument jets is replaced with a coercionvariable L- which is expected to satisfy the subject-constraints ofthe verb serve.
The abductive inter-144pretation of (Q1) brings forward a reasoning pathshowing that variable k may be coerced to any sub-sumer of concept person.
Such a subsumer is synset{steward, flight attendant}, having the gloss(an attendant on an airplane).
This gloss translatesthe generic relation between jets (a hyponym of air-planes) and variable k to the predicate on, cued bythe prepositional relation attendant-on-+airplane.The interpretation of this prepositional relation isproduced when it is matched against WordNet-based classes of prepositional attachments collectedfrom large treebanks, following the methodology de-scribed in (Harabagiu, 1996).
For this case, the on-prepositional relation attaches the place of work tothe worker, thus giving meaning to the coercion ofjets into flight attendants.Although the coercions derived in TACITUS do notdistinguish the predicative or referential cases, theypresent a different method of building metonymicpaths.
By incorporating this unification-basedmechanism of producing coercions with a lexicalpath-finder working on WordNet, a novel way ofderiving metonymies is made possible.
It has theadvantage that it relies only on approximations ofsortal knowledge, as indirectly available from theWordNet database, and it does not need full-fledgedabductions to be able to return metonymic paths.3 Metonymic  pathsThe process of deriving metonymic paths fromWordNet consists of three distinct phases: (1) theidentification of sortal constraints that need to besatisfied during the interpretation of nominal ex-pressions, (2) the retrieval of related knowledge thatcomplies with the sortal restrictions, and (3) the val-idation of coercions against anaphoric expressionsfrom the sentences following the processed sentence.The first two phases rely on access to semanticinformation available in (1) the relational seman-tic encoded in WordNet (e.g., hvpernyms, is_part,is_member, is_stuff" entail or pertaymym) spanningsynsets or words encoded in the database and (2)the semantic of the synset definitions (known asglosses).
To be able to have computational ccessto the gloss semantic, synset definitions have beentranslated into logical formulae inspired by nota-tion proposed in (Hobbs, 1986-1) and implementedin TAClTUS.Based on the davidsonian treatment ofaction sen-tences, in which events are treated as individuals,every gloss is transformed in a first-order predicateformula for which (1) verbs are mapped in predi-cates t,erb(e,z.y) with the convention that variablee represents the eventuality of that action or eventto take place, z represents the subject of the ac-tion.
and Y represents its object (in the case of in-transitive verbs, Y is not attached to a predicate.whereas irt the case of bitransitive verbs, y is as-sumed to range over both the direct and indirectobject); (b) nouns are mapped into their lexicalizedpredicates and (c) modifiers have the same argumentas the predicate they modify.
Prepositional attach-ments are indicated by preposition-predicates rang-ing over the pair of arguments of the predicates theyattach.
For example, the gloss of synset {a i r l ine ,a i r l ine  bus iness,  airway} is (a commercial en-terprise that provides scheduled flights for passen-gers) and has the following logical form transforma-tion (LFT):\[ea~ ezptise (x) ~:co~ereial (z) &provide (e, x, y) &~:t li~cht (y) ~scheduled (y) ~f  or ( e, p) ~passenge:r  (p) \]Characteristic ofLFTs is the fact that the gloss genusis always the first predicate, rendering the LFT aformula of the form \ [genus(x )g :d i f fe rent ia (y ) \ ] .Gloss geni are accessed repeatedly during the deriva-tion of metonymic paths, and thus they need to beeasily accessible.The first two phases of the metonymic inferencerelies also upon lexico-semantic relations determinedby derivational morphology, specifically the links be-tween verbs and their nominalizations.
Relations be-tween verb and noun synsets that have elements withcommon morphological roots have been added to thedatabase, classifying them as (a) the action nominal-ization; (b) the result (or object) of the action or (c)the agent (or subject) of the action, For example,verb propose and noun proposal  refer to the sameaction.
A nominalization(act) link was establishedbetween verb synset {propose, pro jet1:} and thesense of proposal  glossed as (the act o/making aproposal).
A second nominali=ation(result) link wasestablished between the same verb synset and thesense of proposal glossed as (something proposed).Phase h Approz~mation / the sortal constraints.A nominal N is interpreted as literal or figurativedepending on whether its sortal constraints to syn-tactically linked verb V are satisfied or not.
Sortalinformation can be found in:?
(i) the LFT(g), where g stands for the gloss of anysense i of V (hence Vi) or any of its hypernyms;?
(ii) LFT(e).
where ?
represents an example from 8;?
(iii) I, FT(c).
where e represent those glosses whereand V co-occur (and the sense of Y is unknown}.To access the sortal constraints of V implicitly en-coded in WordNet, we collect all expressions fromLFT(g) or LFT(e) such that:(1) they contain a predicate verbi(e~, x\[, x~),representing either (a) V/ or (b) one of its hypernymsor (c) one of the geni from the LFTs of I,~ or itshypernyms;(2} they also contain any predicate that is (a) a subject,(b) an object and/or {c) a prepositional ttachmenttO verb i  in the same /..FT.When all predicates are conceptualized in the re-spective LFTs.
such expressions have the form:145S i  ~ i i i verbi(el ,xz, x~) ~ subjecti{x~)  objecti(x~) &:l'Iflprepj(e~,yj) ~ nou.j(y~))The sortal information for subjects and objects ofVi is:S.b jeet , (V )  = Uk  ?
i i subjectk(zl.k ), where subjectik is:(a) the subject from some Si (= S~) and(b) is the hypernym of any other subject (from anotherS~ ok) that belongs to the same WordNet hierarchy.Objecti(V) = Uk, objeet~,(x~ ~, ), where objectik, is:' kt (a) the object from some Si (= Si ) and(b) is the hypernym of any other object (from anotherS~ 'ok') that belongs to the same WordNet hierarchy.Similarly, for each prepositional attachment de-termined by a preposition prep, we define the sortalinformation:Nouni(V ,prep) \[.Jk,, i i i = nounk,,(x t.~,,) where nounk,, is:(a) attached to verbi n some Si (S~") through prep and(b) is the hypernym of any other noun attached throughprep (in another S~ ''gh''), when both nouns belong tothe same WordNet hierarchy.Expressions S" are collected from the r.xT(?).
Thesemantic sense k of V in S~ is selected as a result ofthe fact that the similarity measure between S" andthe collection {5; } is maximal when i = k. The sim-ilarity measure between two expressions i definedas :Similarity(S'~,SO = Sim(subject, S~,Si) ++ Sim(object.S~,,S~) + j  Sim(prepj, S'~, Si)))where for role E {subject, object,{prepj} } we have:(i) Sire(role.

Sorts satisfaction amounts to (1) the recog-nition of the sense of V in the text and (2) a searchfor any element from Role-Sorti(V) across all con-cepts semantically related ro all WordNet senses ofN (given that t/has the same role in the text).The recognition of sense i of V is based also onthe maximal value of similarity between S,, theexpression retrieved from the r~T of the text, and{Sort,(V)}.
where Sort,(V) is defined as:IIIIII!II!III!!!
!Sorti(V) = Subject_Sort;(V) & Object_Sorti(V) && I-Ii Prep_Sorti(V,prepj)The satisfaction of Role_Sorti(V) is a search forany element from this set alng (1) all synonyms, (2)all hypernyms and (3) all ~ geni for each Word-Net sense of N. If this search is successful, we rulethat N had a literal reading.
Otherwise, we needto build metonymic paths to be able to access therelated knowledge.
Two distinct ways of derivingmetonymic paths have been developed.Lezico-semantic paths.
The codification ofmeronymic relations in WordNet determines theconsideration of lexico-semantic paths composed ofisa and at least one is_part, is_member, or is_stuffrelations (or their reverses} as a means of deriv-ing coercions.
Implementing 22.20% of the semanticconnections between noun concepts as meronyms,WordNet 1.6 sets an acceptable level of granular-ity for a knowledge representation needed to derivemetonymic nformation.Lexico-semantic metonymies retrieve conceptsCm E Role.Sorti(V) that (1) are linked through ameronymic relation to any WordNet sense of N (orone of its hypernyms or geni); (2) morphologicallyor idiomatically indicate meronymic relations to N,or (3) represent predicates from the LFr of N (or itshypernyms) having thematic roles for the same verbthat is the genus of the LFr.
The general form of thelexico-semantic paths is determined to be PathLs= (Co--N, rhChr2 .... ,Crn), with at least for one i, riis a WordNet meronymic relation.
The case whena triplet (Cj_t,ri,Ci) is part of an LFT extends theclassical metonymies object-for-agent and product-for-producer.The WordNet concepts that morphologically cuemeronymic relations are those synsets containingcollocations of such lexemes as un i t  (e.g., admin-istrative unit, army unit), system (e.g., exhaustsystem, file system), par~ (e.g.
body part, aca-demic department), group (e.g., jazz group, pres-sure group), or other words that form the same hier-archies as part to member.
Similarly, concepts con-taining in their glosses idioms like ' 'a group o f '  'or ' 'part  o f '  ' cue meronymic relations to theglossgenus.Morpho-logical paths.
Frequently, N is a nominal-ization ofa VN, and thus LFI'(VN) brings forward re-lated semantic information.
Moreover.
the nominal-ization relations indicate the role of N in the r.Fr(E~):a nominal izat ion(resul t )  link corresponds toan object role.
whereas a nominal izat ion(agent)link relates to a subject role of N in the LFT(rv~).This entails the interchangeability of the genus ofr.yr(N) with verb(e, zt,z~)&noun(zi) (with i=l  ifrole=subject and i=2 if role=object) when verb isthe predicate representing l,'h and noun is the predi-cate for N or any of its geni (in the hierarchies of the146sense of N morphologically related to l/~v).
The re-sulting logical form transformations are denoted asL~'  (~).In this case, we can compute the Similar-ity(Text,LFT' (N)) and pick the Role(s) for which itis maximal and incorporate the corresponding LFTsin the most similar r.FT, (N), producing the final co-ercion.
Morpho-logical paths are sequences of threekinds of steps: (1) relatedness based on morphologi-cal relations (i.e., N-nominalization-~VN), (2) ad-hoe weighted abduction based on similarity betweentext roles and the logical forms of the hypernymsof N (i.e.
LFT' (N)-Similarity(text)~LFT(Roles)),and (3) unification of similar logical expression (i.e.,LFT' (VN)-unification(LFT(text)-+Nc.Morpho-logic paths exploit morphological linksand overlaps in the L~S and resolve predicativemetonymies (by bringing into play additional ver-bal predicates).
In contrast, lexico-semantic pathsresolve referential metonyies.Phase III: Anaphora validation.
Metonymicpaths produce the expected coerced knowledge ifthey bring forward concepts that corefer with nom-inals from the successive sentences.
There arethree tests for the validation of coercions throughanaphora.
They determine whether there is a con-cept in a lexico-semantic path or a predicate in amorpho-logical path that (1) is identical, (2) is ahypernym, or (3) is a genus of one of the nonfinalexpressions from the following sentences.4 A case  s tudyThe processing associated with the derivation ofmetonymic paths is exemplified on a text presentedin the manual defining the coreference task for theDARPA-sponsored MUC 7 competition (Hirshmanand Chinchor, 1997):(S1) The White House sent  i t s  hea l th  care propo-sa l  to the Congress yesterday.

Nounproposal as a nominalization is a candidate formorph-logic path derivations as well.
The search forsortal constraints for the role of subject is not suc-cessful, requiring the inference of metonymic paths.A lexico-semantic path is derived, linking sense 1of White House to person, the genus of synsetadministrat ion:Pathl: l lhite.Houso-isa--~govenmentAepartaent--- isa-+administrat i re_ t ra i t  - morphological.zue-~-+admiaistration--genus-~personThe meronymic morphological cue from Pathl isconsistent with the meronyms encoded in Word-Net 1.6, because we have:(a) govemment-department- is_part-+admirdstrationas an immediate inference from Path1(b) adminJstration-is_part--~governmentas a semantic relation encoded in WordNet 1.6(c) govemment-department-is_part-.+governmentas a semantic relation encoded in WordNet 1.6Moreover, the anaphoric validation of Pathl ispossible because nominal admin is t ra t ion  ispresentin (S2).In the case ofObject2(send) a morpho-logical pathaccounts for the coerced knowledge.
Nominalizationproposal  is the result of the action expressed bysynset V'={ propose,project}.

This is en-forced by the LFT of synset {motion,question},a hyponym of sense I of proposal.

Further-more, since Congress is a hyponym of assemblyand the filler of Prep_Sort2(send.to) in (S1).we can unify Lgr(motion), LFT'(proposal) andLgT(legislature) and obtain the final coercion as:147proposal(p)=~present (e2, z l ,  z~.

The final unification rein-forces the relevance of logisla~ttre, congruent withthe coreferential link between b i l l  and 1am5 Conc lus ionsThis paper proposes a method of derivingmetonymic coercions by using the information avail-able in WordNet 1.6.
The method oes not presup-pose the availability ofsortal constraints, but ratherbuilds approximations of ortai information from theknowledge implemented in WordNet.
It uses two dis-tinct approaches for knowledge coercion: one thatrelies on lexico-semantic information, another basedon morphological links and unifying logic formulae(LF'rs) inferred from conceptual definitions.To evaluate this methodology of deriving metonymiccoercions, a test set of 20 New York Times articleswere parsed by FASTUS (Appelt et al, 1993) andused in conjunction with their coreference keys, asprovided by the MUC test data.
There were 1261nominal expressions, distributed in four classes as il-lustrated in Table 1.
A percentage of 23% nominalswere  anaphoric, out of which almost 74% had literalmeaning.
In approximating the sortal constraints,sorts for 68.2% of nominals were returned.
When thesorts were not satisfied by searches through Word-Net, metonymic paths were derived.
As Table I in-dicates, 68.9% of these paths were lexico-semantic(denoted with r=-referential metonymies) and 31.1%were morpho-logical (denoted with p=predicativemetonymies).II ,Vo~,.~l ry~ III "' L i to~,  I Me~onymy II,,Bare :~ (16\[r%i' r=3 p=sDefinite ~5 (34.8%) r=', p=4Indefinite '6 (2.7%) r=9 p=5 \] ~:\[..

These results indicatethat we need to experiment with different similar-ity measures.
We also found that the metonymieshave a significant contribution as knowledge sourcesfor coreference r solution.
43% of the coreferencekeys were accounted by mere string matches.
