ON THE TYPES OF SEMANTIC COMPRESSION OF TEXTN.
No Percova "Facu l ty  of  Numerical Mathematics and Cybernet i csMoscow State  Un ivers i ty ,  U .S .S .R.Any text  i s  const ruc ted  in  accordance with Imp l i c i tp r inc ip les  of semant ic  compress ion.
The paper a t tempts  todescr ibe  some of these  pr inc ip les .There are two main types of  text  semantic  compress ion:(1) the omiss ion of  "meaningfu l"  par ts ,  and (2) the omiss ionof  s tandard connect ions  among par ts  of  the text .1.
The f i r s t  type of compress ion  i s  subd iv ided  in to :(a) omiss ion w i th in  a pred icat ion  (by a pred icat ion  i s  meantthe s t ruc ture -  "pred icate  - P, i t s  aotants  - A") ,  and (b)omiss ion  of  the whole pred icat ion .&.
In  spec ia l  cond i t ions  a par t  of  a p red icat ion  shouldbe understood as the whole pred icat ion  in  accordance with 6basic rules+/: A -~AP, P -~AP, A...P -~AP, Ai...A j -~-FAIPA j, A i -~AiPA j, A i ~A j -Examples.P -~ APThe patient was operated.

The omiss ion of  a p red icat ion  i s  d iagnosed by the pre -sence of  another  p red icat ion  (PRj) ,  which i s  connected wi ththe omit ted pred icat ion  (PR) by such re la t ions  ( j ) ' as  "ps~t"( inc lud ing  stsLrt ing,  in termed ia te  or  f ina l  po in t  or in terva l ) ,"a t t r ibute" ,  "accompazkTing", react ion" ,  "cause" ,  e tc .
( thenumber of such re la t ions  seems not to  exceed 20).

The omiss ion of  s tandard connect ions  among the par tsof  the text  can e i ther  be un iversa l  or  depend on the type ofthe text .
The texts  can be d iv ided  in to  two main ~p~cups-"phys ica l ly  o r iented"  and "menta l ly  o r iented" .
Roughly speak-ing ,  phys ica l ly  o r iented  texts  descr ibe  events  as they  occ - rand ~p~oup the events  in  accordance wi th  the i r  sequence,  wh i lementa l ly  o r iented  texts  descr ibe  the events  as they are re -f lec ted  in  the text  author  s mind and group the events  in to( ind iv idua l  or soc ia l l y  acknowledged) c lasses .an important  subc lass  of  (2) const i tu te  the cases  o f  "de-te rminat ing" .

A pieceof the text connected with a definite determiner is calledItJ "sphere of oper@tion".
Along with constant determiners(such as one in text (ii)) there are variable determlners:their meaning is regularly changed while moving through thetext (something like a co~ter).
An ex~nple of a variable de-terminer is a sequence of predicate time markers in physicallyoriented texts, which usually are partially omitted and shouldbe reconstructed during the text aualysis.To process a constant  determiner  i s  to f ind  i t s  sphereof operat ion ,  to process  a var iab le  determiner  i s ,  bes ides ,to  f ind  out a propor t iona l  change of i t s  meaning.The reconst ruct ion  of text  omiss ions demands us ing  d i f -fe rent  k inds of in fo rmat ion ,  among which an important  ro lebelonsm to "c~inon-sense"  knowledge.
