A "universal grammar" isdefined, together with pal-ameters of variation forspecific languages.
The system, written in Prolog,parses, generates, and translates between Englishand Spanish (both directions).i.
IntroductionThe theory of Gov~t  and Binding (GB) (Chc~sky1981) proposes universal principles of grammar (UG)that underlie all natural grammars, with theprinciples being subject to parametrization, givingrise to language variation.
One example is the so-called "pro-drop" parameter of languages likeSpanish, Hungarian, C~ineae, etc., that, among otherthings, allow '%dssing" subjects.
To model such atheory, one needs merely (~) to define the UG alongwith an appropriate set of parameter values for eachlanguage, as opposed to defining totally independentlanguage-specific grammars.
The overall size of thesystem is thereby reduced, and adding the grammarfor a new language ideally means simply adding itsparameter settings.
Hence the motivation for a GBapproach to machine translation.To test the approach, a model of UG was constructed,parameters defined for Spanish and English, andlanguage-specific rules added for morphology and,where necessary, idiosyncratic syntax.
The result isthe GB-Translator (GBT) (Sharp 1985).A general knowledge of GB is assumed in thefollowing, as is a familiarity with Prolog, thelanguage in which the GBT is implemented.The overall strategy of the GBT is as follows:(I) a. read in a sentence in the source language;b. perform a morphological and constituentanalysis, building an S-structurerepresentation;c. convert the S-structure to D- ("deep")structure via reverse-transformations;d. perfor~ lexical transfer frc~ the source D-structure to target D-structure;e. transform the D-structure to one or more S-structures;f. validate each S-structure for well-formed-hess;g. "flatten" and display only the well-form~ltarget sentences.Since GB is primarily a theory of syntax, no seman-tic processing has been introduced in the GBT.
Whatis of interest here is the variety of syntacticforms available in diverse languages for expressingsemantically equivalent propositions, with "equi-valence,, being controlled by appropriate choices oflexical items in the two languages.
Problems ofsemantic ambiguity and structural alteration havenot been addressed, as this relates more to trans-lation theory than to GB.An example of the system's behavior is shown below,where user responses are underlined:(2) Enter source language: 9_e_e~lish.Enter target language: ~ ish .Enter sentence in english: I believe John tohave told the truth.Yo creo clue Juan ha dicho la verdad.Creo que Juan ha dicho la verdad.Enter source language: ~L3anish.Enter target language: ~ l i sh .Enter sentence in spanish: Creo que has dichola verdad.I believe that you have told the truth.I believe you have told the truth.I believe you to have told the truth?2.
System StructureThe GBT contains a UG conioonent and two language-specific components, one for English, one forSpardsh.
Exploiting the modular nature of GB (seeWehrli 1983), the UG consists of a phrase structurecc~nent  based on X-bar syntax (Jackendoff 1977), atransformational component that includes the ruleMove Affix (=affix-hopping) and the general rule ofMove Alpha (including the subjacency constraint),and a well-formedness component containing con-straints on surface representations.
The UG, then,is an expression of the theories of X-bar, Case,Theta, Government, Binding, and Bounding (Choms\]oy1981) (see Fig.
i).The l~ge-spec i f i c  ccmi0onents consist of a lexi-con and a grammar.
The lexicon includes (i) thelexical entries, and (2) tables of inflections andcontractions (e.g.
Spanish del = de + el).
The gram-mar contains the UG parameters and idiosyncratictransformations.

LexiconDictionary e/itries are represented as Prolog unitclauses:(3) dict (Lang, Word, Cat, Features).where 'Lang w is the language~ 'Word' is the lexicalunit, 'Cat ~ is the syntactic category, and'Features' contains a list of morphological andsyntactic features along with the transfer value.Sc~e s?~01e entries are shown below:(4) di~c(e,put,v, \[subcat(\[n,p\]) ,spanish(poner) \]).dict (e,believe,v, \[~0cat (n), sub cat (c), sdel (+),~nish  (o~r)  \] )?dict  (e, seem,v, \[subcat (c) ,sdel (+) ,theta(~),spanish ( ~ )  \] ).dict (s,poner,v, \[subcat ( \[n, p\] ), english (put) \] ).dict (s, c~er,v, \[subcat (n) ,subcat (c),english(believe) \] ) ?dict (s,pgxecer,v, \[subcat (c), sdel (+) ,theta(=),english (~)  \] ).~e  verbs ~_t and poner s%Lbcategorize for an NP andpp.
Believe subcategorizes for either an NP or aclause, as does its Spanish equivalent, creer.
Theformer has the S-bar Deletion property, while thelatter does ~ot, allowing for an infinitival comple=ment for believe but not for creer (see (2) above).Seem and parecer do not assign thematic roles to thesubject, ir~Lcated by the feature "theta(-)", thusgiving rise to sentences such as It seems John hasleft/Parece que Juan ha salido.
Note that since seealand parecer also have the "sdel(+)" feature, theybeth exhibit subject=raising: John seems to haveleft/ Juan_~ece haber ealido.Other features in the lexicon include person,ntm~er, gender, tense, irregular forms (e.g.go/went), \[?wh\], \[?pronoun\], and \[2anaphor\] (~cmlsky1982)o4.
l%mase St1~ctureThe primary l~n~ase stru?
:~ure rules are given in (5),using X-bar syntax and written in the gra~arnotation of Clocksin and Mellish (1981):(5) x2(L,C, \[\[C,F\],Spec,XllPost\] ) -->specifier (L, C, Spec),xl(L,C,Xl) ,postadjunct (L, C, Post).xI(L,C, \[PreHD,HDIPostHD \] ) -->pz~adj unct (L, C, ~) ,x (L ,C ,HD,~) ,complements (L, SUBCATS, PostHD).For language L and category C, the x2 rule aboveconstructs a imrse tree containing nodal information(category and what will become phrasal features)followed by the specifier, the X1 sub-structure, andany ~-ad juncts  (e.g.
PP modifiers).
The xl ruleparses a pre-adjunct, t/le head, and the complementsof the head, the latter tak~ frcm the subcategor-ization features of tJ~e head.
In this way, theparser is head-driven (Proudian and Pollard 1985);the head determines the course of f~irther parsing.The rule in (5) is used for all major phrasalcategories, i.e.
NP,VP,AP,PP, as well as the clausalphrases COMP (=S-bar) ar~ INFL (~) (Stowell 1981).
(It should be pointed out that (5) reflects head-initial gran~nars.
A simple parameter could beinserted to aocommodate head-final grammars, such asfor SOV languages like German, but this introducesparsing problems for Prolog.
)As an ex-~r~ole, the following structure is created:for the sente/%ce The man had seen many_~i\[~LS_ fromhis window, where the symbol $e denotes an emptyvalue, and " " denotes a place-holder for features:(6) \[\[c,_\], Se, \[ Se, Se,\[\[i,_\], \[\[n,_\], the, \[ Se, man \]\], E Se, Se,\[\[v,_\], had, \[ $e, seen,\[\[n,_\], ~ny, \[ $e, things \] \]\],\[\[p,_\], Se, \[ $e, fz~m,\[\[n,_\], his, \[ Se, window \]\]\]\]\]\]\],\[mode, decl\] \] \]5.
System OperationFollowing the strategy :in (i), the GH9 reads in asentence (assumed to be grammatically correct),analyzes the ~orphology of each word, and appliesthe phrase structure rule (5) recursively to buildthe S-str~Icture.
Then, all movement transformationsare undone and features percolated to the phrasalnode, at whidi time f~iture agreement is ch~-~ed.%he result is a D-structure in which all (and only)thematic elements are in e-marked positions,thereby satisfying the Theta Criterion (Chomsky1981).
This also simplifies lexical translation (asopposed to trmlslating ~tween LF representations).125The transformation stage presents the mostinteresting aspect of the system, since this iswhere the principles of UG are applied.
(since thei r~t  is assumed to be ~t ica l ,  it is not testedfor well-formedness. )
The high~level Prolog programfor this stage is given below:(7) tra~gformation(L, Dstruchure, Sstrdcture) :-transform (L,matrix (+), Dstructure, Sstructure),dbl_CC~P_filter (L, Sstructure),wh filter(L, Sstructure),case filter(L, Sstructure),b ~  conditions (L, Sstructure),ecp(L, Sstructure).The first action is to transform the D-structure toan S-structure.
The "transform,, predicate is calledrecursively on each cyclic node (~-bar), beginningwith the most deeply embedded one.
The transforma-tions include those listed in Figure 2 above plusthe general transformations of Move Affix and MoveAlpha.The next step involves checking the resulting S-structure for well-formedness.
(Note that the well-formedness conditions could execute in parallel,given appropriate machine architecture.)
An S-structure that fails to pass any of the conditionsforces backtracking into the ,,transform,, predicate.For example, the clause in (8a), which involves nomovement, will be generated, but since John cannotbe assigned a grammatical Case, it fails the CaseFilter.
Backtracking to Move Alpha results in Johnmoving to the non-8-marked subject of seem (8b),resulting in a well-formed structure:(8) a.
*It seems John to have left.b.
John seems t to have left.Another example that illustrates how parametersaffect generation is given by the Empty CategoryPrinciple (ECP), which requires traces to beproperly governed.
Given the following parametersettings:(9) proper_governor(english,v).proper_governor ( english, p ).proper_governor (spanish, v).proper_governor(spanish, i).where the last statement is interpreted as "INFL isa proper governor if it contains the feature\[+tns\]", the "ecp" statement in (7) will allowpreposition-stranding in English but not in Spanish(i0), and allow "that-trace" in Spanish but not inEnqlish (11) :(i0) Which film did they leave after t?After which film did they leave _t ?Despu4s de cuil pelicula salieron ellos _t ?
*Cu~l pelicula salieron ellos despu~s de t ?
(11) Who seems t to have left?Who does it seem _t has left?
*Who does it se~s that t has left?Qui~n parece t haber salido?Qui~n parece que t ha salido?A similar use of parameters controls subjacencywithin Move Alpha.
To show that S-bar is a boundingnode in Spanish, Torrego (1984) notes that Verb Pre-posing ~mlst occur in every clause that contains awh-phrase or its trace in OCMP.
In (12a), the traceof con ~ui~n causes inversion whereas (b) is derivedwithout movement to (~MP, obviating inversion:(12)a. Con qui~n sabia Juan _t que habia hablado Maria t ?b.
Con qui~n sabia Juan que Maria habia hablado t ?
('With wh~ did John know that Mary had spoken?
')The GBT system operates solely on the basis ofsyntax.
In a more complete translation system,issues of semantics, pragmatics, and discourse mustbe dealt with, ideally by again assuming generalprinciples subject to parametric variation.
Never ~theless, the current system i l lustrates thefeasibility of a generalized syntactic ~nent  inan overall language processing device.7.
