The Semantics and Syntax of Russian Pronominal Structure: a feature breakdownC.
H. VAN SCHOONEVELDJanua L ingu~ FoundationAncienne maison MillionVozerier-Amancy, 74800 par La Roche-sur-Foron(Haute-Savoie) PranceAbstractElaborating one of the points of his Coling ~onn1986 paper, the author discusses prononfn~lity,which is due to a special semantic stratum, singula-tire identifieational deixis.
Personal, reflexiveand interrogative pronouns have additional trans-n\[issional deictic markings, but singulative identi-ficational pronominality alone has a direct anaphorieeffect and tends to reinforce syntactically.
This,explains, for instance, German sich selbst.i.
In several publications of mine /van Schoo-ncveld 1982/, /idem forthcoming-A/, /idem forth-c~ning-C/ \]i have had occasion to mention in passingthe specia\] nature of pronouns.
Pronouns have theirown type of deixis.2.
Deixis is traditionally used for the type ofmeaning which results from the once-occurring speechact, Sauss~e' s parole, being recodified, that is,being incorporated back into the langue.
In adverbslJJ<e here \[~nd now the code refers to actual applica-tions o--o-f--J?self-?- We cannot identify the referent ofhere and now without taking recourse to our havingT~-~tifie~-~he given speech act.
11~e speech actbecomes a part of the narrated situation /Bru~nann1904/,  /Lyons 1977, pp.638 sqq./.3.
It is an empir ica l  fact, however,  that  lan-guage can also indicate an ident i f icat ion act whichtakes place dur ing the narrated situation.
Thus wehave to do in the preposition out with a space whichl~s been identified (an in -spa~ and subsequent\].ydiscarded as irrelevant ~ the next identification,so that "out" is the resulting meaning.
What is ira-portent he~.
is that all identifications, subsequentones as well as the first, may take place in the~m~ated situation, not necessarily during the speech(the transmission) act.Do we have to do with deixis in the case ofidentification in the narrated situation?
l~%at de-pends on how we use the word deixis.
If we under-stand by deixis the reincorporation of an identifi-cation, act into the code, that is, the prerogation,by the first identifier, of the identification of thereferent, then we can speak of deixis also in thesecond case~ when the entire identification proceduretakes place Jn the narrated situation alone.
Butthat is not the way the term deixis has been usedtraditJo~\[\].ly by linguists.
In the traditional con-ceptualiza'i:ion, deixis is of a tranmnissional nature.If~ however, we are.
to use the term deixis forany recodJfication of the initial identification ofthe refer(u~t, including identifiuation in the narra-ted situation, "then we must distinguish between mereidentificational deixis (in the narrated situation),and the traditional type of deixis, which I calltran~nissional deixis.
In pronouns we have to dowith a deixis of the identificational variety.4.
Of both types of deixis, transmissional andidentificational~ there exist two varieties: m\]uTmh~rked type and a singulative tqfpe /van Schoone-veld forth;oming-A/.
In the singulative type~ allidentifications take place at the same moment.
Pro-nominal deixis is singulatively identificational.Singultative transmissional delxis gives rise toreferences to the process of the transmission, thatis, the pzx~ess of pronunciation itself.
It regu-lates~ for i\[~stance, the relation between grammaticalmorphemes (endings) and lexical morphemes.
In singu-lative identificational deixis all identificationsin the narrated situation must take place simultane-ously with the first one.5.
It is obvious that singulative ~ansn\[issionaldeixis is the type of deixis which is at the basis ofdemonstrative pronouns.
In "the framework of the de-mons?~ative pronouns our vantage point is that of anidentifier operating within the narrated situation;in the personal pronom~s the speech si'ttmtion isinvolved at the same time.In the personal pronom%s, we have to do with asemm~tie mechanism more complex than that of the de-monstrative pronouns.
The personal pronouns set upobjects as being on a par with speaker and receiver,since they define these objects (referents) furtherin terms of the speech situation.
In using the firstperson the speaker looks at his own image in the nfir-ror of the singulative r~rrated situation.
Mutatismutandis "the same happens in the second and thirdperson.8.
Pronouns in general are n~rked by singulativeidentificational plurality (plur"').
Singulativeidentificational plurality means that there is multi-ple synchronized identifiability of the referent.
Asingu\]ative (mini-)narrated situation is created.
Thereferent of the demonstrative pronoun 'that' equals a(mini-)narrated situation.Personal pronouns are, being pronouns, marked byplur"' , but a further specification (subclassifica-tion) is done by transmissional semantic tea hines.7.
At this point, I should mention t\]~t I haveempirically concluded that Russian semantic values canbe expressed in terms of six Semantic features whichoccur on each of the four deictic levels mentioned;i.~., by 24 semantic features.
These features con-stitute an ordered set in that each succeeding teatimeincorporates the information given by its predecessor/van Schooneveld 1983/, /idem forthcoming-C/..P!urality, the first feat\[~e, instructs therecelver to perform more tl~nn one identification onone object or to identify more than one object.DimensJ~nality singles out from a plurality of identi-fications a subset which is distinct from its peers.Preidentity indicates that the first identificationmust be assumed to have been performed earlier thanother identifications in the narrated or speech situ-ation.
Extension reidentifies an identified elementand imp l~e la t ive  unaffectedness by the identi-fication situation; cancellation signalizes the com-plement of an originally identified set, and objec~tiveness indicates that the referent can be at anyfrcm the element initially identified.?

The third person is, additlonally to plur ,marked by transmissional plurality (plu~").
In thepronouns, plur" creates a reference in the speechsituation which must not necessarily be identifiedwith the speaker or the receiver but can be repeatedly(i.e.
a multiple of times) identified.The second' person is, additionally to plur"' ,n~rked by (non-singul~tive) transmissionS, dimension-ality (dim").
Dim" says that there is a subset ofelements in the speech situation which have a propertyin common.
What else constitutes a more conspicuoussubset of actants in the speech situation than thosewho actively participate in it?
The second personindicates the direct participant in the speech situa-705tion.The first person is, in addition to plur"' ,marked by (non-singulative) transmissional preiden-tity (preid").
The identity of the referent (thespeaker or the central actant in the speech situa-tion) has been established befomehand by an aetant(participant) in the speech situation: the speakerhimself.The next feature in the hierarchy of semanticfeatures is extension.
Extension signifies that thereferent has already been identified and hence isminimally independently characterized by this(repeat) identification.
It is obvious that thereflexive pronoun is nothing else but the varietyof personal pronoun that is marked by (non-singula-tive) ?~ansmissional extension (ext").
Its referenthas already made an appearance in the speech situ-ation.Is there a personal pronoun marked by (non-singulative) tr~smissional cancellation?
It wouldsignify an object which in the speech situationwould not be immediately identifiable.
It is evidentthat the indefinite/interrogative pronoun kto 'who'~to 'what' is the personal pronou/~ marked b--y--cane".- -  9.
SJ~gulative identifieational(plur"') means a multiple synchronized identifiabilitywhich is valid only during the synchronized identi-fications.
The demonstrative pronoun that is markedby plur"' .
One of  its eombinatory varl~-~n-~s isanaphora.
As Lyons has eoncluded~ anaphora is buta eombinatory variant of the ostensive significationof pronominality /Lyons 1977, pp.657 sqq./.
Anaphorais per definitionem contextually conditioned.Pronominal dimensionalit\[ (singulative identifi-cational dJ~ensionality \[dim" '3) will mean that theanaphor is seen as distinct frcm its background.
Onemight say the full extend of the referent up to itsoutlines becomes crucial.
The pronominal adjectiveall conveys this meaning.- -  Pronominal preidentity will mean that withregard to a given narrated situation and its compo-nents the referent will be once-oecuringly unexpected;evidently it is the pronominal adjective other thatcarries singulative identificational prei~6~-~ty(preid"').Singulative identificational extension (ext"')will mean that the referent has a l r ~ n  identi-fied and is, in synchronization with this originalidentification, reidentifiable an indefinite numberof times.
The referent is indefinitely reidentifi-able.
The pronominal self (Russian sam \[long forms~--~S' German selbst)~-i~ marked bye" '  .ingu lat iv e i--- l"-~6-nt if teat tonal cancellation(cane"') will mean that at a moment preceding a once-occurring nax~ative situation, there has been an iden-tification of a referent but this referent is in thetime period synchronized with this identification nolonger available for identification.
In English, thepronominal which, Russian ~ ,  indicating theident i f ie r '~apab i l i ty  of identifying the referentdirectly, is used either in appeals for elucidation(that is, in questions, as an interrogative pronoun),or anaphorically, that is, as a relative pronoun.
InGerman~ the eorresponding welch can in addition beused as an indefinite pronoun.
~ which andWelch Work off the naxe~ted situation, w~s thepe~na l )  interrogative/indefinite pronouns kto/~to,which/what and wer/was work off the speech Situatl-~0-n.bb-~tivene--s~ ~-dicates a referent which isidentifiable at random.
In the pronominal category~the pronoun any is marked by obj"' .i0.
In conclusion, a few words on the interre-lation between semantic structure and syntax.The interrogative pronominal ~ ,  whieh~welch (marking: cane"") that is a contextua vv~iantof the relative pronoun refers to an already identi-fied narrated situation, as it should do given thegeneral properties of the eaneellation feature.
Thispronominal is essentially coreferential.
ThusRussian kotor~ 'which' means 'which member(s) of analready ~ven set' and ~hglish which itself also im-plies membership in a set alead-~-i~entified; theclaim of some granmars That which implies a choicebetween two items is obviously based on the mostfrequent Jnstantiation of its interrogative usage.German welch used as indefinite pronoun also is core-ferentia-~.
In Ich babe kein Geld.
Has du welches?
'I have no money.
Do you have some?'
welches canrefer only to money~ whereas w~_~s 'whatm--Crs--omething ' )is inappropriate.
In contrast to the singulativelyidentificational pronominals discussed in section 9,personal pronouns (see under 8) are not coreferential.For instance, in Russian, the specifically interroga-tive (personal) pronouns kto 'who' and ~to 'what'(plur"' + cane") are not c--6~eferential e-x~ept in afew explainable cases (e.g.
vse kto 'all who').Coreferentiality also occurs mn the (singula-tively identificational) pronominal expression markedby ext"', in Russian the short foz~n adjective sam,long (adjectival) form s~f~ in English self ~-d inGerman selbst.
The Russ--lan--reflexive (p~-{o~ml)pronoun s -~,  latin se, German sieh is merely thepersonal-~-noun mark~ by plu~"~--i--ext '' (see aboveunder 8).
It is the pronoun with minimal referenti-ality and hence maximal coreferentiality, seen direct-.ly from the speech situation as orientation point.The reflexive (personal) pronoun reminds the audienceof the existence of a person in an exclusive narratedsituation (plur"') and says that this referent is no-thing new in the speech situation -- it is not aperson mentioned for the first time.
The reflexivepronominal adjective discussed in 9: Russian sam,English self, latin i_2s_e, G~rman selbst~ on the otherhand, whle~h--is marked by singulatlve ld~----~entificationalextension (ext"'), does not create the illusion of anindividual, but merely signalizes the quality ofintrovertivity.
It signalizes coreferentiality limi-ting its range of reference strictly to stay withinthe confines of the given narrated situation.
Ob-viously the referent of the reflexive pronoun is thelikely carrier of this introvertivity.
Thus arisein various languages expressions which are emphaticparallels to the reflexive pronoun: Russian~ German sieh selbst.
Singulative identifiea-tlonal deixis ~ ~econd layer of anaphora.Incidentally, singulative identificational deixis canbe shown also to provide the struetural basis of thesystem of number words ~ like two, three and so on~which are, again, typically ~-~ho~ /van Schoone-veld for%hccming-B/.The conclusion suggests itself that for a des-cription of syntactic relations involving pronounssingulatively identifieational features are a crucialand effective tool.706Russ.
