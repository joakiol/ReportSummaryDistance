In t roduct ionI am concerned with the relationship between the forms of linguistic expressions, nounphrases in particular, and the discourse ntities to which they refer, s That  is, when does a nounphrase introduce a new referent into the discourse?
My concern in particular is to specify the rolethat the discourse context plays in answering this question.
A simple first approach to the rela-tionship between noun phrases and discourse entities might suggest that definite noun phrasesrefer to entities which are assumed to be mutually known to the speaker and hearer, andindefinite noun phrases refer to entities which are not mutually known, and thus, that discoursecontext plays no role at all.
This discussion will point out problems with this approach for bothdefinite and indefinite noun phrases.
I will describe examples where definite noun phrases areused to introduce new referents, and, conversely, where indefnite noun phrases do not introducenew referents.
In the first case, the local focus structure provides a guide to recognising that anew entity is involved, and in the second case, the recognition that no new entity is introduced isbased on the given/new status of propositions in the discourse.I will begin by describing certain definite descriptions that introduce new entities.
I will thendescribe some examples where indefinite descriptions do not introduce new entities.
In each case, Idi l l  discuss some related processing issues.I will restrict he current discussion to deal with cases where the mutual knowledge is basedon the discourse context, rather than on knowledge that the speaker and hearer bring to aninteraction.
In the canes of indefinltes, I will also restrict my discussion to sententlal contextswhere an indefinite could introduce a new entity; in other words, to specific contexts, as dis-tinguished from non-specific ontexts as discussed in ~rince1981\].2.
Imp l i c i t  Assoc ia tesThe case of definite noun phrases that are intended to introduce new discourse entities hasbeen relatively well-researched, in particular by~awkins1978, Hawkins1984\] Hawkins points outthat entities that have a slot/frame relationship with previously introduced entities often have adefinite determiner.
For example, in(1) There were loud noises com;,g from a starting sir compressor.
The drive shaft was sheared.it is possible to refer to the drive shaft with a definite noun phrase because of its relationship withthe previously mentioned starting slr compressor, even though the drive shaft has not been men-tioned.
This same relationship is described by ~rince1981\] as in/errable, and is also discussed in~Ieim1982\].
Because we understand the drive shaft mentioned in {1)to be not just any driveshaft but the drive shaft that is part of the air compressor mentioned in the previous sentence, afull understanding of this noun phrase must capture this relationship.

associated with the local/oeus as described in ~)ahI1986\], and\[Sidner1979\].s The research described in this paper was supported in part by DARPA under contract N000014-85-C-0012, admin-istered by the Office of Naval Research, and by ?

I have received helpful comments on this paper from John Dowdinc, Lynette Hirechman, Marci?
Linebarger, Marth?Palmer, Rebecc?
SchiS'man, and Bonnie Webber.October  1, 1986 154In (2d), for example, the referent for the paper seems to be the paper associated with the newpackage even though there is a previously mentioned entity which matches the noun phrase; thatis, the paper in (2b).
(2) a.
A package arrived yesterday.b.
The wrapping paper was beautiful.c.
~Tnlle I was admiring it, another package arrived.d.
I removed the paper.After the focus change to mlr pae\]:age, the associates of the new package seem to he pre-ferred as referents over previously mentioned items, even if the old items had been in focus at onetime.
This is consistent with Sidner's algorithm.

Spec|F;c At t r ;but lvesThe second main point to be dealt with in this paper is that of indefinite noun phrases in specificcontexts, which nevertheless fall to introduce new discourse ntities.
Most of those who have dis-cussed indefinites eem to have assumed that an indefinite reference in a specific context invari-ably introduces a new discourse entity.
This includes the discussions in ~-\[.Clark1977\] and~-\[e\[m1982\].
However, there is a class of indef;nites, which I have called speclJ~c a~trlbu~iees~Dah11984~, which I claim do not have this function.Consider the example,(3) a. Dr. Smith told me that exercise helps.h.
Since I heard it from a doctor, I 'm inclined to believe it.An entity, Dr. Smith, is introduced in (3a), and an indefinite noun phrase, a doctor, is used in(3b).
It is clear that this noun phrase is not intended to introduce a second doctor into the discus-s;on.
This is an example of a spec~j~c attrlbut~ee.
I use the term speeij~c in the sense that aspecific reference means that the speaker has a particular individual in mind when s/he uses theindefinite description.
It is clear in (3), for example, that the speaker did not hear that exercisehelps from some unspecified octor, but from Dr. Smith.The term a~trlbu~iee, as used by ~Donnellan1971\], can also be applied to these indefinites,although it was originally suggested only for definites, because the specific identity of Dr. Smith isnot relevant o the predication, only Dr. Smith's attribute of being a doctor.
(See~Dahl1984 .\] fordetailed arguments about the applicabll\[ty of this term.
)There are tw~ important issues that must be dealt with in a treatment of specific attribu-tives.
First, there is the issue of recognizing that the noun phrase in fact is not being used tointroduce a new entity.
Second, it is necessary to recognize the speaker's purpose in using anindefinite noun phrase, when a definite noun phrase would have been possible.
Both of these issueshave implications for language generation as well as understanding.
For example, in the first casea \]~nguage generator w~ have to decide when it is possible to use a specific attributive, and inthe second case, it wall have to decide whether a specific attributive would be useful in accom-plls}~ug its communicative goals.I have previously suggested ~Dsb11984~hat  specific attributive can be recognized by itsoccurrence in a proposition that is glwen as in (3), is related to a given proposition by simpleentailment as in (4), or is related to a given proposition by a plausible inference, as in (5).
(4) Mary and Bill both volunteered to walk the dog.
Since at least one pcrsoft is wi\]l~g to walkthe dog, we don't have a problem.SA discussion by \[Heim19821 suggests hat introduction of a new entity with a definite noun phrase is a violation ofa felicity condition, and is therefore to be handled by a repair or accomodation mechanism.
Since accommodation mechan-isms are typically triggered by the failure of normal processing, Heim's approach suggests hat a failure of normal procees-ing would have to occur before ?
system could recopise that ?
new referent was being introduced.
If normal proee..i.gmeans earching through the discourse context for a referent matching the new description, then the example in (2) pro-vides evidence against his position, since the correct processing cannot have been invoked by the failure to find a match-in?
referent in the previous discourse.October  1, 1986155(5) A: I 'm afraid I miscalculated Jones's insulin dosage.B: What  happened?A: IIe died.B: So, a patient has finally died due to your carelessness.
(inference 'Jones is a patient')Thus, in order to determine when an indefinite introduces a new entity, it is necessary toknow whether the proposition in which it occurs is f~ven or nero.
For this, we need a represents-tion of the events and situations described in the discourse, which can then be examined in orderto determine when a proposition is given or new.
Such a representation, of course, will be neededin any case for pronouns or full noun phrases that refer to events and situations.
For example, inthe PUNDIT text processing system, (described in ~a~ner1986\] ), a representation is built foreach event or situation mentioned.
A'noun phrase like the failure in (6) or it in (7) can then herecognized as a reference to something previously mentioned.
(6) The starting air compressor fal\]ed when the oll pressure dropped below 60 psig.
The failureoccurred during the engine start.
(7) The starting air compressor failed when the oil pressure dropped below 60 psig.
I~ occurredduring the engine start.The difference in processing between (6) and (7) on the one hand and specific attributives on theother is that for the specific attributives we are saying that something analogous to reference reso-lution should be performed on clauses, as we\]\] as on noun phrases.
That  is, we want to askwhether th;~ event has been mentioned before, or can be inferred from something that has beenmentioned.
If so, we can match corresponding participants o that it is possible to recognize thatno new entity is being introduced, sThe second issue raised by specific attributives is the speaker's purp()se in selecting anindefinite when a definite would have been possible.
This seems to he related to the use ofindefin|tes in genera\] to serve to deemphaslze the particular individual referred to whUe emphasiz-ing its genera\] class.
In (3), for example, it is not the fact that ~}~im doctor told me that exercisewould help that is relevant, but rather that the person has the property of being a doctor.
Noticethe contrast between (3) and (8).
(8) a. Dr. Smith told me that exercise helps.h.
Since I did hear it from the doctor I 'm inclined to believe it.
(8) suggests that there is something special about Dr. Smith in particular that makes this advicereliable, while (3) does not.To sum up, I have discussed two categories of noun phrases which demonstrate the effects ofdiscourse context on determining whether a new entity is introduced.
Implicit associate definitesintroduce new entities which are related to the local focus.
Specific attributives refer to prevlous\]yintroduced entities in given propositions.
Minimally, specific attributes have to be recognized, inorder to prevent the creation of an extra discourse entity, and this requires a representation ofgiven propositions.
In addition, a complete understanding of specific attributes requires a recogni-tion of the speaker's reason for choosing an indefinite when a definite would have been possible.References~ah\]1984~.
