AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION THROUGH UNDERSTANDING ANDSUMMARIZINGN.
N. Leont evaVsesojuznyJ centr perevodovKr~l~anovskogo 14, 117 218 Moskva, USSRFrench to Russian automatic translation system be lng  de-veloped In All-Unlon Centre of Translation is conceived aspart of a multlfunctlonal information processing system inthe sense that It should be able to use approaches and methodsproper to the information processing field, such as summariz-ing, abstracting, indexing, making inferences, etc.
In such asystem translation is realized through building text informat-ion representation (IR).
The task requires two types of ana-lysis: linguistic analysis (LA) and information analysis (IA)working in interaction, the latter being, in particular, ableto refer to the automatic thesaurus.
The ultimate aim of LA isthe building of sentence semantic representation (SR).
It isimportant that for each individual sentence its SR Is con-\ s t ruc ted  as a function of the IR of the whole text.
(The cur-rent version of the system does not operate with the wholetext but is limited for each sentence with Its more or lessimmediate context.)
Linguistic analysis calculates morpholog-ical structure for words, syntactic and semantic structuresfor sentences.
Each of these structures is determined by theapproprlete language realities; still remaining obscuritiescan be cleared only by referring to higher levels of analysis.SR built for an lndlvlduel sentence without regard to othersentences" SR's is normally incomplete (deficient, ambiguous Iincorrect, etc.).
SR incompleteness Is manifested by incomplet-- 178  -eness of its units?
The construction of text IR requiresoperations of comparison of different SR units as well astheir comparison with thesaurus units.
As a rule, incomplet-eness proper to SR's As cleared onl~ partially, which callsfor some external measures to ensure a formally correct struct-ure ready for the synthesis of the output text.
The generalscheme of the system functioning runs as follows:1 ?

Reconstruction compares SR's with each other andwith the thesaurus and restaures the missing parts of S~'s.Summarizing means obtaining a klnd of an abstract from whichall obscure and Incomplete parts are removed so that onlyessential Information Is available.Information processing plays an important role in ~ealle-ation of the scheme as the system translates only what itcomprehends, thus the result may be called not a literal buta "digested" translation.
The information model of automatictranslation is based on the properties of the coherent text.One of the main properties Is that pieces of informationessential for the text are repeated there In many ways and byvarious iIngulstlc means.
IA alms at Identifying such infor-mation and making it the basis for SR reconstruction.
The le-vel of "information noise" in the synthesized text Is expectedto be lower than In the classical approach to AT (sentence-to--sentence translation through syntactic structures).
Thedegree of abstracting (summarizing) can vary depending On thepurpose: the system can be oriented at getting a translation- 179  -proper ,  a deta i led  or  a b r ie f  abs t rac t  s a summery, o r ,  f ina l -l y ,  a search  pat ter~.
