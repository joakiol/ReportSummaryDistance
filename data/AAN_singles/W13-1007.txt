If weproject a large MWE lexicon onto a corpus, project-ing fixed forms suffers from low recall, while an un-constrained flexible search for lemmas yields a lossin precision.
In this talk, I will describe a methodaimed at maximising precision in the identificationof MWEs in flexible mode, building on the idea thatinternal variability can be modelled via so-calledvariation patterns.
I will discuss the advantages andlimitations of using variation patterns, compare theirperformance to that of association measures, and ex-plore their usability in MWE extraction, too.About the SpeakerMalvina Nissim is a tenured researcher in computa-tional linguistics at the University of Bologna.
Herresearch focuses on the computational handling ofseveral lexical semantics and discourse phenomena,such as the choice of referring expressions, semanticrelations within compounds and in argument struc-ture, multiword expressions, and, more recently, onthe annotation and automatic detection of modality.She is also a co-founder and promoter of the SensoComune project, devoted to the creation of a com-mon knowledge base for Italian via crowdsourcing.She graduated in Linguistics from the University ofPisa, and obtained her PhD in Linguistics from theUniversity of Pavia.
Before joining the Universityof Bologna she was a post-doc at the University ofEdinburgh and at the Institute for Cognitive Scienceand Technology in Rome.51
