Contrastive filtering of previ-ously extracted MWTs results in a con-siderable increment of acquired domain-specific terms.1 IntroductionMulti-word term (MWT) extraction is a challeng-ing and well-known automatic term recognition(ATR) subtask, aimed at retrieving complex do-main terminology from specialized corpora.
Al-though domain sublanguages are characterized byspecific vocabularies, a well-defined border be-tween specific sublanguages (SLs) and generallanguage (GL) vocabularies is difficult to establishsince lexicon shifts in a continuum from a highlyspecialized area to a transition area between GLand SLs (Rondeau et al, 1984).
Within this con-tinuum, Cabre?
(1999) identifies three types of lex-ical items: a. GL lexical items; b. SL terms, c.lexical items belonging to a borderline area be-tween GL and SL.
The proportion of these dif-ferent types of lexical items varies depending onthe text type.
To our knowledge, automatic termrecognition methods proposed so far in the litera-ture focussed on highly specialized corpora (typ-ically, technical and scientific literature), mainlycharacterized by SL terminology.
However, thesame ATR methods may not be equally effectivewhen dealing with corpora characterized by a dif-ferent proportion of term types; e.g.
from textssuch as Wikipedia articles, which are conceivedfor a more extended audience, both SL terms andcommon words are acquired as long as they showa statistically significant distribution.
In this pa-per, we claim that the contrastive approach toMWT extraction described in Bonin et al (2010)can be effectively exploited to distinguish be-tween common words and domain-specific termi-nology in different types of corpora as well as toidentify terms belonging to different SLs when oc-curring in the same text.
The latter is the case oflegal texts, characterized by a mixture of differ-ent SLs, the legal and the regulated-domain SLs(Breuker et al, 2004).
Effectiveness and flexibil-ity of the proposed ATR approach has been testedwith different experiments aimed at the extrac-tion of domain terminology from corpora charac-terized by different degrees of difficulty as far asATR is concerned, namely (i) environmental sci-entific literature, (ii) Wikipedia environmental ar-ticles, and (iii) a corpus of legal texts on environ-mental domain.2 General Extraction MethodThe MWT extraction methodology we follow isorganized in two steps, described in detail inBonin et al (2010).
Firstly, a shortlist of well-formed and relevant candidate MWTs is extractedfrom a given target corpus and secondly a con-trastive method is applied against the selectedMWTs only.
In fact, in the first stage, candi-date MWTs are searched for in an automaticallyPOS-tagged and lemmatized text and they are thenweighted with the C-NC Value method (Frantzi etal., 1999).
In the second stage, the list of MWTsextracted is revised and re-ranked with a con-trastive score, based on the distribution of termsacross corpora of different domains; in particu-77lar, the Contrastive Selection of multi-word terms(CSmw) function, newly introduced in Bonin etal.
(2010), was used, which proved to be partic-ularly suitable for handling variation in low fre-quency events.
The main benefit of such an ap-proach consists in its modularity; by first selectingvalid MWTs which have significant distributionaltendencies, and then by assessing their domain-relevance using a contrastive function, the MWTsparsity problem is overcome or at lest signifi-cantly reduced.3 ExperimentsThe MWT extraction methodology describedabove has been followed in order to acquire envi-ronmental terminology from three different kindsof domain corpora.
The first experiment has beencarried out on a corpus of scientific articles con-cerning climate change research of Italian Na-tional Research Council (CNR), of 397,297 to-kens, while the second experiment has been car-ried out on a corpus of Wikipedia articles fromthe Italian Portal ?Ecologia e Ambiente?
(Ecol-ogy and Environment) (174,391 tokens).
As gen-eral contrastive corpus, we used, in both cases,the PAROLE Corpus (Marinelli et al, 2003)1, inorder to filter out GL lexical items.
The thirdand more challenging experiment has been car-ried out on a collection of Italian European legaltexts concerning the environmental domain for atotal of 394,088 word tokens.
In this case, as con-trastive corpus we exploited a collection of Ital-ian European legal texts regulating a domain otherthan the environmental one2, in order to extractMWTs belonging to the environmental domain,but also to single out legal-domain terms, used inlegal texts.
For each acquisition corpus we fol-lowed the two-layered approach described above,selecting, firstly, a top list of 2000 environmentalMWTs from the candidate term list ranked on theC-NC Value score and, secondly, re-ranking this2000-term list on the basis of the CSmw function;then we extracted the final top list of 300 envi-ronmental MWTs.
In order to assess the effec-1It is made up of about 3 million word tokens and it in-cludes Italian texts of different types.2A corpus of Italian European Directives on consumerprotection domain for a total of 74,210 word tokens.tiveness of the approach against different types ofcorpora, we analyzed the two 300-term top listsof MWTs acquired respectively after the first andthe second extraction steps.

distribution,so that they could be easily compared.
The eval-uation has been carried out by comparing the listsof MWTs extracted against a gold standard re-source, i.e.
the thesaurus EARTh (Environmen-tal Applications Reference Thesaurus).3.
In ad-dition, a second resource has been used in thethird experiment for evaluating legal terms: theDizionario giuridico (Edizioni Simone)4.
Thoseterms which could not find a positive matchingagainst the gold standard resources were manuallyvalidated by domain experts.Scient.Lit.

Firstly, they show that the proposed con-trastive approach to domain-specific MWTs ex-traction has a general good performance.
As Fig-ures 1, 2 and 3 show, the amount of environ-mental MWTs after the contrastive stage increaseswith respect to the amount of MWTs acquired af-ter the candidate MWT extraction stage carried3http://uta.iia.cnr.it/earth.htm#EARTh%202002.

Secondly, re-ported results witness that such performances aredifferently affected by the different types of in-put corpora: as summarized in Table 3, the rela-tive increment of environmental MWTs after thecontrastive filtering stage ranges from 11.3% to23.81%.
Interestingly, as shown in Table 1, theresults obtained in the first and second experi-ments show similar trends.
This is due to the over-whelming occurrence in the two input corpora ofspecialized terminology with respect to the GLitems.
Differently from what could have beenFigure 1: Scientific articles.

However, a qualititative evalu-ation of MTWs extracted revealed that this lattercorpus includes terms which belong to that bor-derline area between GL and SL (case c. in theCabre?
(1999) classification).
It follows that inthe Wikipedia case the contrastive stage filteredout not only common words, such as milione didollari ?a million dollars?, but also terms such asunita` immobiliare ?real estate?
belonging to suchborderline area of terminology; their difficult clas-sification slightly decreases the contrastive stageperformance.In the third experiment, the total amount ofenvironmental MWTs percentually increased by23.81% after the second stage of contrastive re-ranking.
Differently from the previous experi-ments, in this case we faced the need for dis-cerning terms belonging to the vocabulary of twoSLs, i.e.
regulated domain (i.e.
environmental)terms and legal ones (e.g.
norma nazionale, na-tional rule): this emerges clearly from the resultsreported in Table 2 where it is shown that thesame number of environmental and legal MWTs(i.e.
12 terms) are extracted at the first stage inthe first 30-term group, and that the contrastivere-ranking allows the emergence of 21 environ-mental MWTs against 4 legal MWTs only.
Thistrend can be observed in Figure 4, where the di-vergent lines show the different distributions ofenvironmental and legal terms: interestingly, linescross each other where legal terms outnumber en-vironmental terms, i.e.
in the last 30-term group.Such a relative increment with respect to the C-NC Value ranking can be easily explained in termsof the main features of the two methods, where C-NC Value method is overtly aimed at extractingdomain-specific terminology (both environmentaland legal terms), and the contrastive re-rankingstep is specifically aimed at distinguishing the rel-evance of acquired MWTs with respect to the in-volved domains.4 ConclusionIn this paper we tackled the challenging task ofMWT extraction from different kinds of domain79Figure 2: Wikipedia articles.

We demonstrated that the multi-layeredapproach proposed in Bonin et al (2010) can besuccessfully exploited in distinguishing betweenGL and SL items and in assessing the domain-relevance of extracted terms.
The latter is the caseof type of multi-domain corpora, characterized bythe occurrence of terms belonging to different SLs(e.g.
legal texts).
Moreover, the results obtainedfrom different text types proved that the perfor-mance of the contrastive filtering stage is dramat-ically influenced by the nature of the acquisitioncorpus.5 AcknowledgmentsThe research has been supported in part by a grantfrom the Italian FIRB project RBNE07C4R9.Thanks are also due to Angela D?Angelo (ScuolaFigure 4: Legal texts.
