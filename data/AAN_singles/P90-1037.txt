LEXICAL AND SYNTACTIC RULES IN ATREE ADJOINING GRAMMARAnne Abeill6*LADL and UFRLUniversity of Paris 7-Jussieuabeille@zeta.ibp.frABSTRACTaccording to this definition 2.
Each elementarytree is constrained to have at least one terminalat its frontier which serves as 'head' (or 'anchor').Sentences of a Tag language are derived from thecomposition of an S-rooted initial tree with otherelementary trees by two operations: substitution(the same operation used by context freegrammars) or adjunction, which is morepowerful.Taking examples from English and French idioms, thispaper shows that not only constituent structures rules butalso most syntactic rules (such as topicalization, wh-question,pronominalization ...) are subject to lexical constraints (ontop of syntactic, and possibly semantic, ones).
We show thatsuch puzzling phenomena re naturally handled in a'lexJcalized' formalism such as Tree Adjoining Grammar.
Theextended omain of locality of TAGs also allows one to'lexicalize' syntactic rules while defining them at the level ofconstituent s ructures.1 INTRODUCTION TO 'LEXICALIZED'GRAMMARS1.1 Lexicalizing Phrase Structure rulesIn most current linguistic theories theinformation put in the lexicon has been increasedin both amount and complexity.
Viewingconstituent structures as projected from thelexicon for example avoids the often notedredundancy between Phrase Structure rules andsubcategorization frames.
Lexical constraints onthe well-formedness of linguistic outputs has alsosimplified the previous transformationalmachinery.Collapsing phrase-structure rules into thelexicon is the overt purpose of 'lexicali7ed'grammars as defmed by Schabes, Abeill6, Joshi1988 : a 'lexicallzed' grammar consists of a fmiteset of elementary structures, each of which issystematically associated with one (or more)lexical item serving as 'head'.
These structures arecombined with one another with one or morecombining operation(s).
These structures pecifyextended omains of locality (as compared toCFGs) over which lexical constraints can bestated.
The 'grammar' consists of a lexicon whereeach lexical item is associated with a finitenumber of structures for which that item is the'head'.We here  assume famil iar ity with T ree  Ad jo in ingGrammars, which are naturally 'lexicalized'* The author wants to thank Yves Schabes, Aravind Joshi,Maurice Gro~, Sharon Cote and Tilman Becker for fruitfuldiscussions, and Robert Giannasi and Beatrice Santorini fortheir help.Schabes,  Abei l l~, Jo~hl 1988 show that contextfree grammars cannot in general be lexicalized(using substitution only as the combiningoperation).
They also show that lexicalizedgrammars are interesting from a computationalpoint of view since lexicalization simplifiesparsing techniques, because the parser uses only arelevant subset of the entire grammar: in a firststage, the parser selects a set of elementarystructures associated with the lexical items in theinput sentence, and in a second stage thesentence is parsed with respect o this set.
Asshown by Schabes, Joshi 1989, a parser'sperformances are thus improved.We show here that such 'lexicalization' should beextended to other components of the grammar aswell, thus challenging the usual distinctionbetween 'lexical' and 'syntactic' rules.
Furtherparsing simplification is therefore xpected.1.2 'Lexicalizing' lexicai rulesAs has often been noticed, rules (or transitivityalternations) such as passive, particle hopping,middle, dative-shift ... are subject to lexicalidiosyncrasies.
There are of course syntactic andsemantic onstraints governing such phenomena,but lexical ones seem to be at stake to.If one considers double objects constructions,passivation of the second NP is regularly ruledout on syntactic grounds.
Passivation of the firstNP, on the other hand is subject to lexicalrestrictions as the example of 'cost', opposed to'envy' or 'spare', shows:They envy John his new car.John is envied his new car.The mistake cost Mary a chance to win.?
* Mary was cost a chance to win.The judge kindly spared John the ordeal.John was kindly spared the ordeal.One might argue that such differences may bedue to some semantic onstraints, but even verbswith similar meaning may exhibit strikingdifferences.
For example, in French, 'regarder' in292 2 Categorial grammars are also 'lexicalized'.its figurative readin?
(to concern) and'concerner', which is a true synonym in thiscontext, behave differently:.Cette affaire regarde Jean* Jean est regard6 par cette affaireCette affaire concerne J anJean est conceru~ par cette affaire (M. Gross1975)It also seems a lexical phenomenon that "change"but not "transform" allows for ergative alternationin English'The witch changed/transformed John into a wolfJohn changed into a wolf* John transformed into a wolf (G. Lakoff 1970)To take another example, dative shift (or there-insertion) is often thought of as applying to asemantically restricted set of verbs (eg verbs ofcommunication or of change of possession, fordative), but this does not predict he differencebetween 'tell' that allows for it, and 'announce' or'explain' which do not3:John told his ideas to MaryJohn told Mary his ideasJohn explained his ideas to Mary* John explained Mary his ideasLexicalist frameworks uch as GPSG, whichhandles uch phenomena by metarules (definedon 'lexical' PS rules), or LFG, which defmes themat the f-structure l vel (ie between 'lexical forms')could capture such restrictions.
D. Flickin?er1987 handles them explicitly with a hierarchicallexicon in HPSG, considering such rules to holdbetween two word classes (verbs here) and toapply by default unless they are explicitly blockedin the lexicon.But all these representations rely on a clear-cutdistinction between lexical and syntactic rules andit is not clear how they could be extended to thelatter.2 LEXICAL CONSTRAINTS ON SYNTACTICRULESThe distinction between 'syntactic' rules 4 that donot usually change argument structure nor3 To dismiss 'announce' or 'explain' on the mere basis oftheir latin origin would not do, since 'offer', which comesfrom latin as well, does exhibit dative shift.4 Wc use the term 'rule' for conveniency.
It does not matterfor our pu~,  whether these phenomena are captured bymeaning of the sentence and are supposed toapply regularly on syntactic structures, and'lexical' rules that alter argument structure, maychange the meaning of the predicate and mayexhibit some lexical idiosyncrasies, usuallyoverlooks the fact that both are subject o lexicalconstraints.There has often been discussions about whethercertain rules, (eg passive or extraposition) shouldbe considered of one kind or the other.
But it hasseldom been realized, to the best of ourknowledge, how often 'syntactic' rules areprevented to apply on what seems purely lexicalgrounds5.Our discussion crucially relies on idiomatic orsemi-idiomatic constructions.
We believe that asizable grammar of natural anguage, as well asany realistic natural language application, cannotignore them, since their frequency is quite high inreal texts (M. Gross 1989).
We first presentexamples of such lexical constraints ontopicalization, pronomi~aliTation and wh-question for both English and French idioms.
Wethen show that similar constraints can be found innon idiomatic sentences.2.1 Flexibility of idiomatic constructionsIdioms are usually divided into two sets (eg J.Bresnan 1982, T. Wasow et al 1982): 'fLxed' ones(not subject to any syntactic rule) and flexibleones (presumably subject o all).
However, thereis quite a continuum between both.Let us take two French idioms usually consideredas "fixed': 'casser la croflte' (to have a bite) and'demander ia lune' (to ask for the impossible).
Itis true that passivation or wh-question do notapply to either.
But pronominalization for theformer, cleft-extraction (c'est que) for the latterdo6:Paul a casse la crotite (Paul had a bite)# Quelle crofite casse-t-il ?# C'est une petite cro0te qu'il a cassee.derivation rules as such or by constraints on the well-formedness ofou~ut structures.5 An interesting exception being Kaplan and Zaenen 1989'sproposal that wh-movement and topicalization beconstrained at the f-structure level, ie by LFG's 'lexicalforms'.6 # marks that the sentence is not possible with the desiredidiomatic interpretation.
There may be some variationsamong speakers about acceptability judgements on suchsentences (and on some of the following ones).
Suchvariability is indeed a property of lexical phenomena.293?
Paul est en train de casser une petite cro~te tj'en casserais bien une anssi.
(Paul is having alittle bite, I wouldn't mind having one too)Jeanne demande la lune# Ouelle lune demande-t-elle ?C'est la lune qu'clle demande !# Jeanne demande la lune et Paule la demandeaussi.
(Jeanne is askin~ for the moon and i'masking for it too)These idioms are thus not completely fixed (asopposed to idioms such as 'casser sa pipe' or 'kickthe bucket'), and some grammatical functionmust be assigned to their frozen NPs.
But thedifferences among them are somewhatunexpected: 'casser la cro~te' (where the nouncan be modified and take several determiners)does not allow for more rules than 'demander lalune' (where the frozen NP is completely fixed).If one now takes an idiom usually considered asflexible, 'briser la glace' (to break the ice), whichdoes passivize, we notice the same distribution aswith 'casser la crof, e':Paul a bris6 la glace# Ouelle glace a-t-il bris6e ?# C'est la glace qu'il brise77 Jean a bris6 la glace hier et c'est ~ moi de labriser aujourd'hul.
(Paul broke the ice yesterdayand I have to break it today)Passive is allowed but not wh-question, norcleft extraction.
It is difficult to dismiss suchphenomena as rare exceptions.
Looking atnumerous idioms shows that one combination ofsuch rules is not more frequent than the other.
Itis also difficult to fred a clear semantic principleat work here.Similar restrictions eem to be at work inEnglish.
If one takes some English idioms usuallyconsidered as 'flexible' (or even not idiomatic atall): NP0 give hell/the boot to NP1.
The mainverb 'give' seems to behave syntactically andsemantically as in non idiomatic constructions:Dative shift applies and we have the regularsemantic alternation : NP1 get hell/the boot(from NP0), with identical meaning.
But it is notthe case that all expecte rules apply: passive isblocked, pronominalization the object oo:# Hell was given to Mary (by John)# The boot was given to Mary (by John)# Alice gave hell to Paul yesterday and she isgiving it to Oscar now.# Oscar gave the boot to Mary, and he will give itto Bob too.294Syntactic rules may also apply differently todistinct 'flexible' idioms.
It is easy to lind idiomswhich do passivize but don't allow forpronominaliTation r topicaliTation in the sameway:They hit the bull's eye.The bull's eye, they hit.?
John hit the bull's eye and Paul hit it too.They buried the hatchet.77 The hatchet, hey buried.# John buried the hatchet and Paul buried it/onetoo.For relativation also, there might be similardifferences:The strings that Chris pulled helped hime get thejob (Wasow et al 1982)# The bull's eye that John hit helped him get thejob.# The hatchet that he buried helped him get thejob.Distinguishing between fixed and flexible idiomsis thus not sufficient.
Because different rulesapply to them differently, without a clearhierarchy (contrary to Fraser 1970), one shoulddistinguish as many different types of flexibility asthere are possible combinations of such rules.Similarly, if one wants to follow T. Wasow et al1982 's suggestion that some kind ofcompositional semantics should be heldresponsible for the syntactic flexibility of idioms,as many degrees of compositionality should bedefined as there are combinations of syntacticproperties.
Direct encoding of the latter is thuspreferable, and such a semantic 'detour' does notseem to help.This does not mean that no regularities couldbe found for idioms' syntax but that they have tobe investigated ata more lexical evel.2.2 Some lexical constraints on non IdiomaticconstructionsGoing back to non idiomatic onstructions, itseems that their syntactic properties may besubject to similar lexical idiosyncrasies.If one considers double objects constructions, Itseems a lexical phenomenon that wh-question onthe second N-P is allowed with 'give' or 'spare',and not with 'envy' or 'cost', and thattopicalization is allowed with 'spare' only:They envy John his new car* What/* Which car do they envy John 7* This brand new car, everyone envies JohnThe mistake cost Mary a chance to win* What/ *Which chance did the mistake costMary ?
* This unique chance, the mistake cost MaryThe judge' spared John the ordealWhat / Which ordeal did the judge spare John ?This ordeal, the judge kindly spared JohnIf one now considers the first NP, topicMi-ationappfies differently to:* Mary, the mistake cost a chance to win.9 John, you have always envied his extraordinaryluckJohn, the judge kindly spared the ordealIn French, as noted by M. Gross 1969, propertiesusually thought of as applying to aLl 'directobjects'(passivation, Que-question and Le-cliticizatlon) may apply in fact unpredictingiy.Although the objects of a verb like 'almer' (love)take objects undergoing the three of them, theobject of 'valoir'(be worth) only allows for Que-question and Lc-?llti?i|TagiOiX, that of 'co~\]tter'(cost) only for Que-quesfion and that of 'passer'(spend (time)) only allows for Le-cliticization:Each elementary tree in a Tag is lexicalized inthe sense that it is headed by (at least) one lexicalitem.
The category of a word in the lexicon is thename of the tree it selects.
We only consider heresentential trees for the sake of simpficity.What lexical heads select is in fact a set ofsuch elementary trees called a "Tree Family ~(Abeill~ 1988, Abeill~ et al 1990), each treecorrespondln~ to a certain constituent sructure(initial trees for wh-questions, auxiliary trees forrelative clauses...).
This is the level at whichsyntactic generMiTJtions can be stated, since eachelementary tree may bear specific onstraintsindependantly of any iexical items B.
A TreeFamily consists in fact of all the constituentstructures trees which are possibly allowed for agiven predicate 9.Examples of trees in the n0Vnl Family (verbstaking two NP arguments) are the followlngl0:I IS a!

*Qu' a-t-il pass6 A travailler .97These differences are all the more surpri~in?that 'cofiter' and 'valoir' are otherwise very doseverbs (same subcategorization frames, ~meselectional restrictions).Looking for some generalization principles withwhich to predict such restrictions hould bepursued, but it seems that they will be of a lexlcalkind.3 LEXICALIZED RULES IN A TREEADJOINING GRAMMAR3.1 Tree Families7 ?

would be better.295S a l  s t~A NP,~t .,~tJ SNP0~ VPP N I~I8 Further subdividing these Tree Families, similarly to M.Gross 1975's verb tables for French, and to D. Flickinger1987's wcqrd classes for English, will help reduce the numberof features, and thus the amount of seemingly idiot~craticinformation, associated with each verb.
However, as noted byboth authors, lexical idioayncrasies will never be eliminatedaltogether.9 Tree Family names (nOV, nOVnl...) are somewhat similarto 'lexical forms' in LFG in the sense that they capture boththe predicate argument structure and the associatedgrammatical functions (which we note by indices: 0 forsubject, l for first object...).
Notice that the Tree Family namedoes not change when lexical rules apply.10~marks a substitution node,0marks the head.
We use herestandard TAG trees for commodity of extx~tion, althoughrecent independent linguistic work suggests to slightly modifythem, challenging for example the distinction between VPand V levels (see Abeill~, in preparation).Each tree is identified by a Tree family nameassociated to a feature bundle correspondin~ tothe rules it involves.
For example, a2, a3 and a4are respectively marked11:al  (nOVnl) a2 (nOVnl)passive f -  passive = +Wh-0--- Wh-1 -- -Wh-1--- Wh-0 ffi -e rg  =-a3 (n0Vnl) a4 (n0Vnl)passive=- passive ffi +Wh- l=-  Wh-1 = +erg= + Wh-O = -A given tree can belong to several treefamilies at the same time, which helps factorizingthe grammar in a parsing perspective.
Forexample, a3 can also be considered as belon~n~to the nOV Family (for verbs with one NI'argument) with a different feature bundle :passive =-; Wh-0 = -.
The lexical items headin~ thetree constrain~ its interpretation, eg 'sleep' willinterpret a3 as nOV, while 'bake' or 'walk'interpret it as n0Vnl.Lexical constraints on syntactic and lexicalrules are handled by having the head select itsown subset of trees in its tree family.For example, 'resemble' selects only activetrees; 'rumored' only passive ones, and 'love'select both12:.\[love\],V : n0Vnl \[erg=-\]\[resemble\],V: n0Vnl \[passive =-; erg=-\]\[rumored\],V: n0Vnl \[part, lye = + \]\[donate\],V; to,P : n0VPnl \[dative =-;erg=-\]\[give\],V;to,P: n0VPnl \[erg=-\]\[spare\],V:n0Vnln2These features work as follows: when nothingis said about a feature, it means that the predicateselects trees with the feature being plus of minus;11 One might explicitly define materules, or links betweensuch trees: a passive rule for example, changes the featurepassive of the tree and intervert the features bearing on NOand N1.
Work is being curretly done along this line with T.Becket, Y. Schabes and K. Vijay Shanker.12 We note with square \[I the set of inflected forms of alexical item.
For example, \[10ve\] = give, g~.s, gave, giving.given.
We use a restriction principle to rule out erg= +whenever passive =+ (or dativ~ =+), and vice vemh to theergative feature does not have to appear in the lexicon for'rumored'.when a feature is marked plus, it means that onlytrees with this feature plus are selected (ie thatthe corresponding rule is 'forced' to apply).Such 'lexicallzation' of syntactic rules appliessimilarly in idiomatic and non idiomaticconstructions.3.2 Idioms in a Lexlcalized Tree AdjoiningGrammarTags seem a natural framework to representstructures which at the same time aresemantically non compositional and should beassigned regular syntactic structures (Abeill6 andSchabes 1989, 1990).
Idioms are thus made fallinto the same grammar as non idiomaticcoustructious.
The only specificity of idioms isthat they are selected by a multicomponent head(called 'anchor') and may select elementary treeswhich are more extended than non idiomaticconstructions.
Here are some examples ofelementary trees for 'kick the bucket', 'bury thehatchet' and 'take NI' into account':S i~ S ~t.A ANPo,L v r  ~Po~ vpV e Np  I xAI I I Ithe bucket t lx ~chetANP0~ vr0V NPx~.

Usually,no part of a multicomponent head can beomitted, and trees that are possible for thisargument structure but in which all headelements could not be inserted will be ruled out.For example, what-questions (noted Wh-i) aregenerally disallowed with frozen nominals (andthus not noted for each iexical entry), whereasquestions with wh-determiners (noted Wh-Ni)are not:John took a trip to Spain# What did John take ??
Which trip to Spain did John take ?
(AbeRl6 etat.
1990)In fact, as has been noted by M. Gross 1989for French, Wh-Ni questions seem to be ruled outwhen the determiner of the argument iscompletely fixed, as the following contrasts show:.John spilled the/those beansJohn buried the/#thi~/#a h tchetWhich bean(s) did John spill ?# Which hatchet did John bury ?Similarly, idioms bear syntactic featuresconstrainln?

(What'seating NP ?)
lacks its non interrogative13 "l'he derived trees are the same (modulo the syntacticfeatures explained above).297It has been shown that taklno, idiomatic or semi-idiomatic onstructions into account in a Frenchor Enali~ grammar forces one to define somelexical constraints on syntactic rules such as wh-question, pronominaliTation and topicalization.Such a lexical treatment has been exemplifiedusing Lexicalized Tree Adjoining grammars.
Aninterestlno point about TAGs is that, due to theirextended omain of locality, they enable one toconsider as 'lexicar syntactic rules bearing onconstituent structures, and not only ruleschanging the syntactic ategory of a predicate (asD.
Dowry 1978) or rules chan#,~ the argumentstructure of a predicate (as in T. Wasow 1977 orD.
