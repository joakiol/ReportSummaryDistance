Box 9103NL-6500 HD Nijmegena.hurriyetoglu@let.ru.nlAbstractWe describe a system for real-time detec-tion of security and crisis events from on-line news in three Balkan languages: Turk-ish, Romanian and Bulgarian.
The systemclassifies the events according to a fine-grained event type set.
It extracts struc-tured information from news reports, byusing a blend of keyword matching andfinite-state grammars for entity recogni-tion.
We apply a multilingual methodol-ogy for the development of the system?slanguage resources, based on adaptationof language-independent grammars and onweakly-supervised learning of lexical re-sources.
Detailed performance evaluationproves that the approach is effective in de-veloping real-world semantic processingapplications for relatively less-resourcedlanguages.1 IntroductionWe describe a real-time event extraction systemfor three less-resourced languages: Bulgarian, Ro-manian and Turkish1.
The goal of event extractionis to identify instances of a specified set of eventtypes in natural language texts, and to retrievedatabase-like, structured information about eventparticipants and attributes: these are the entitiesthat are involved in the event and fill type-specificevent roles (Ashish et al., 2006).
For example,in the fragment ?Three workers were injured ina building collapse?, the phrase ?three workers?will be assigned a semantic role Injured of theevent type ManMadeDisaster template.Gathering and tracking such information overtime from electronic news media plays a crucial1While belonging to three distant language families,namely Slavic, Romance and Turkic, respectively, they arespoken in the same geopolitical area, the Balkans.role for the development of open-source intelli-gence systems, particularly in the context of globalnews monitoring of security threats, mass emer-gencies and disease outbreaks (Yangarber et al.,2005).
In this view, it has been proved that be-ing able to rely on highly multilingual text miningtools and language resources is of paramount im-portance, in order to achieve an unbiased coverageof global news content (Steinberger, 2012).The system language components include fi-nite state-based entity extraction grammars anddomain-specific semantic lexica.
These areadapted to the target language from existinglanguage-independent resources or built by usingsemi-supervised machine learning algorithms, re-spectively.
Most importantly, the lexical acquisi-tion methods we put into place neither make useof any language knowledge nor require to have an-notated corpora available.Section 2 outlines the main processing stages ofthe application.
In Section 3 we describe the meth-ods applied to acquire and adapt the system?s lan-guage knowledge bases.
Finally, in Section 4 wereport on an evaluation on event type classificationand on the extraction of slot fillers for event tem-plates, and we briefly discuss system performanceand prospective improvements.2 System ArchitectureAs depicted in Figure 1 (Tanev et al., 2009), firstnews feeds are clustered, upstream of the eventextraction engine, by applying similarity metricsover meta data (named entities, locations, cate-gories) extracted from single articles by dedicated,multilingual software.Event extraction begins by preprocessing the ti-tle and first three sentences of each article withina cluster.
This encompasses: fine-grained tok-enization, sentence splitting, domain-specific dic-tionary look-up (i.e.
matching of key terms in-dicating numbers, quantifiers, person titles, per-65Meta-Data CreationReal Time ClustererGeo-LocatingCore Linguistic AnalysisCascaded EventExtraction  GrammarApplicationEntity RoleDisambiguatorVictimArithmeticEvent TypeClassifierEvent DescriptionAssemblyNewsNewsNewsNewsNewsFigure 1: Event extraction processing chainson groups descriptors like civilians, policemenand Shiite), and finally morphological analysis,simply consisting of lexicon look-up on largedomain-independent morphological dictionariesfrom the MULTEXT project (Erjavec, 2004).
Sub-sequently, a multi-layer cascade of finite-state ex-traction grammars in the ExPRESS formalism(Piskorski, 2007) is applied on such more ab-stract representation of the article text, in orderto: a)identify entity referring phrases, such aspersons, person groups, organizations, weapons,etc.
b) assign them to event specific roles by lin-ear combination with event triggering surface pat-terns.
For example, in the text ?Iraqi policemenshot dead an alleged suicide bomber?
the gram-mar should extract the phrase ?Iraqi policemen?and assign to it the semantic role Perpetrator,while the phrase ?alleged suicide bomber?
shouldbe extracted as Dead.
We use a ?lexicon?
of 1/2-slot patterns of the form:<DEAD[Per]> was shot by <PERP><KIDNAP[Per]> has been taken hostagewhere each slot position is assigned an event-specific semantic role and includes a type restric-tion (e.g.
Person) on the entity which may fillthe slot.Finally, we aggregate and validate informationextracted locally from each single article in thesame cluster, such as entity role assignment, vic-tim counts and event type.We categorize the main event from each clusterwith respect to a fine-grained event type set, shownin Table 1.The event classification module consists of ablend of keyword matching, event role detectionand a set of rules controlling their interaction.First, for each event type, we deploy: a) a listof weighted regular expression keyword patterns:each pattern match is awarded the correspondingweight, and an event type is triggered when theweight sum exceeds a defined threshold; b) a set ofboolean pattern combinations: OR pattern lists arecombined by the AND operator, each pattern is arestricted regular expression and conjunctions arerestricted by proximity constraints.
For examplein order to detect TerroristAttack we use the fol-lowing combination (translated here in English):(?bomb?
OR ?explosion?
OR....) AND (?terrorist?OR ?Al Qaida?
OR..).Besides the event TYPE, the other mainslots of an output event frame include:TYPE, DEAD, DEAD-COUNT, ARRESTED,ARRESTED-COUNT, PERPETRATOR, WEAPON,etc.The system will be demonstrated using a KML-aware earth browser2.
Figure 2 shows a sampleoutput event template.3 Development of language resourcesThe system?s language components are:Event grammar rules They consist of regularexpressions over flat feature structures whose el-ements include, among the others, semantic typesfrom the domain lexica.
We use them to locallyparse semantic entities such as person names, per-son group descriptions, and their clausal combi-nation with verbal event patterns (see Section 2).Grammars in target languages are compiled byadapting the existing rules from source languages,such as English, while the bulk of grammar devel-opment mostly consists of providing suitable lexi-cal resources.Semantic dictionaries Domain-specific lexica,listing a number of (possibly multi-word) expres-sions sub-categorized into semantic classes rel-evant for the event domain, with limited or nolinguistic annotation, are used by entity recogni-tion grammar rules.
Such lexica were created us-ing the weakly supervised terminology extractionalgorithm LexiClass (Ontopopulis), described in(Tanev et al., 2009).
In order to enforce syntactic2E.g.

Notice that Geocoding is cur-rently performed at the level of article text by a language-independent algorithm which is not yet integrated within theevent detection process, while Document Creation Date iscurrently used as the event Date slot filler.66Figure 2: A sample output template of the systemconstraints (e.g.
Case) into event clause rules forRomanian language, we have enriched learnt lex-ical entries for the semantic classes with morpho-logical annotations, using MULTEXT resources.For Turkish, as we do not currently perform mor-phological analysis, we have rather included com-mon inflected forms of the applicable lexical en-tries, resulting in larger lexica.Event triggering patterns They are also ac-quired semi-automatically, starting with a set ofseed examples and an article clustering, by deploy-ing the paraphrase learning algorithm described in(Tanev et al., 2008).
For Bulgarian, the grammar,semantic dictionaries and event patterns were cre-ated simultaneously, following a semi-automaticapproach, described in (Tanev and Steinberger,2013).
In particular, we learned a list of termsreferring to people, institutions and organizationsand the corresponding pre- and post-modifiers(about 5000 terms).
In the same manner, welearned about 550 surface patterns for killing, in-juring, kidnapping and arresting actions, togetherwith a 4 level grammar cascade.Keyword terms The keyword sets used in theevent type definitions, namely the OR lists inthe boolean pattern combinations (see Section 2above), can be viewed as instances of some moreabstract semantic classes, that a domain expertuses to model a target event scenario.
Theseclasses are semi-automatically acquired using theLexiClass algorithm, and then manually com-Table 1: Event type setAirMissileAttack LandslideArmedConflict LightningStrikeArrest ManMadeDisasterAssassination MaritimeAccidentAvalanche PhysicalAttackBioChemicalAttack RobberyBombing ShootingDisorder/Protest/Mutiny StabbingEarthquake StormExecution TerroristAttackExplosion TropicalStormFloods TsunamiHeatWave VandalismHeavyWeaponsFire VolcanicEruptionHostageVideoRelease WildfireHumanitarianCrisis WinterStormKidnapping NONEbined.
As Turkish is an agglutinative language,we have frequently added wildcards at the ends ofkeywords to cover possible inflected forms.4 Experiments and EvaluationSystem performance is evaluated on three differ-ent extractive tasks, carried out on the titles andfirst three sentences of single news articles: eventtype classification, event role name/description ex-traction and victim counting.We collected test corpora of 52, 126 and 115news articles for Bulgarian, Romanian and Turk-ish, respectively, spanning over a time range of 2months3.
For each article in the gold standard, we3Articles were manually selected using news aggregatorssuch as Google News.

In our case, the MRR for aset of N articles is:MRR =1|N |N?i=11rankiwhere rank is the rank of the system type re-sponse within the gold standard type list for eacharticle.For each role name/description extraction sepa-rately, we compute standard Precision, Recall andF1-measure on system responses, based on partial,n-gram match with gold standard responses, ignor-ing morphological suffixes.Finally, we record the root Mean Squared Er-ror (MSE) of system output victim count valuesagainst gold standard, over all applicable roles.Table 2 summarizes the evaluation results.
mFand MF columns for each role description taskrepresent respectively the micro and macro aver-age F1-measure over the test set.Overall, the performance figures are in line withprevious evaluations on other languages (Tanev etal., 2009).
This proves the methodology is ef-fective on adapting the system to new languageseven with little lexical and syntactical proximity.Turkish system consistently outperforms the oth-ers, and it also underwent the most resource devel-opment cycles: this suggests that applying learn-ing iterations, alternated with human filtering, tothe language resources, can increase system ac-curacy, eventually making it usable for real-worldapplications.
System accuracy is still unreliablefor victim counting.
One of the main reasons forlarge errors in victim counting is that the systemsome less frequent event types.interprets historical victim statistics reported in ar-ticles as event instances.
We are currently imple-menting temporal and discourse heuristics to mit-igate this problem.AcknowledgmentsThis study is supported in part by a postdoctoralresearch grant from T?UB?ITAK and by the Dutchnational program COMMIT.ReferencesNaveen Ashish, Doug Appelt, Dayne Freitag, andDmitry Zelenko.
