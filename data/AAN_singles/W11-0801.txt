Proceedings of the Workshop on Multiword Expressions: from Parsing and Generation to the Real World (MWE 2011), page 1,Portland, Oregon, USA, 23 June 2011. c?2011 Association for Computational LinguisticsMWEs and Topic Modelling:Enhancing Machine Learning with LinguisticsTimothy BaldwinUniversity of Melbourne, Australiatim@csse.unimelb.edu.auAbstractTopic modelling is a popular approach to joint clus-tering of documents and terms, e.g.
via LatentDirichlet Allocation.
The standard document repre-sentation in topic modelling is a bag of unigrams,ignoring both macro-level document structure andmicro-level constituent structure.
In this talk, Iwill discuss recent work on consolidating the micro-level document representation with multiword ex-pressions, and present experimental results whichdemonstrate that linguistically-richer document rep-resentations enhance topic modelling.BiographyTim Baldwin is an Associate Professor and DeputyHead of the Department of Computer Science andSoftware Engineering, University of Melbourne anda contributed research staff member of the NICTAVictoria Research Laboratories.
He has previouslyheld visiting positions at the University of Wash-ington, University of Tokyo, University of Saarland,and NTT Communication Science Laboratories.
Hisresearch interests cover topics including deep lin-guistic processing, multiword expressions, deep lex-ical acquisition, computer-assisted language learn-ing, information extraction and web mining, with aparticular interest in the interface between compu-tational and theoretical linguistics.
Current projectsinclude web user forum mining, information person-alisation in museum contexts, biomedical text min-ing, online linguistic exploration, and intelligent in-terfaces for Japanese language learners.
He is Pres-ident of the Australasian Language Technology As-sociation in 2011-2012.Tim completed a BSc(CS/Maths) andBA(Linguistics/Japanese) at the University ofMelbourne in 1995, and an MEng(CS) andPhD(CS) at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in1998 and 2001, respectively.
Prior to commencinghis current position at the University of Melbourne,he was a Senior Research Engineer at the Center forthe Study of Language and Information, StanfordUniversity (2001-2004).1
