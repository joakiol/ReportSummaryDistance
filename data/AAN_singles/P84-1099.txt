TRANSFER IN A MULTILINGUAL MT SYSTEMSteven Krauwer & Louis des TombeInstitute for General LinguisticsUtrecht State UniversityTrans 14, 3512 JK Utrecht, The NetherlandsABSTRACTIn the context of transferbased MT systems,the nature of the intermediate represenations,and particularly their 'depth', is an importantquestion.
This paper explores the notions of'independence of languages' and 'simple trans-fer', and provides some principles that mayenable linguists to study this problem in asystematic way.I.
BackgroundThis paper is relevant for a class of MTsystems with the following characteristics:(i)The translation process is broken down intothree stages: source text analysis, transfer,and target text synthesis.
(ii)The text that serves as unit of translationis at least a sentence.
(iii)The system is multilingual, at least in principle.These characteristics are not uncommon; however,Eurotra may be the only project in the worldthat applies (iii) not only as a matter ofprinciple but as actual practice.We will regard a natural language as a set oftexts.
A translation pair is a pair of texts(T~, T~) from the source and target language,respectively.
One sometimes wonders whetherfor every T$ there is at least one translationTt, but we will ignore that kind of issuehere.For translation systems of the analysis-transfer-synthesis family, the followingdiagram is a useful description:*The research described here was done in thecontext of the Eurotra project; we are gratefulto e~l the Eurotrans for their stimulation andhe lp(i)TRFR~ .

R~.I !l !AN i GEN !
!l !i !Tm T~.TRATRA, AN, TRF, and GEN are all binary relations.Given the sets of texts SL (source language)and TL (target language), and the set ofrepresentations RR, we can say:TRA__~--SL x TL, AN_C-SL x RRTRF ~-_ RR x RR, and GEN~ RR x TLThe subsystems analysis, transfer, andsynthesis are implementations of AN, TRF, andGEN.
In this paper, we are not interested inthe implementations, but in the relations to beimplemented.Especially, we try to find a principled basisfor the study of the represenations R and R .Such a basis can only be established in thecontext of some fundamental philosophy of thetranslation system.
We will assume the follo-wing two basic ideas:(i)Simple transfer:Transfer should be kept as simple as possible.
(ii)Independence of languages:The construction of analysis and synthesis foreach of the languages should be entirelyindependent of knowledge about the otherlanguages covered.These two ideas are certainly not trivial, andespecially (ii) may be a bit exceptionalcompared to other MT projects; however, theyare quite reasonable given a project thatreally tries to develop a multilingual trans-lation system.
In any case, they are bothheld in the Eurotra project.464The reason for (i) is simply the number of trans-fer systems that must be developed for k langua-ges, which isk(k-1).From this, it follows that 'simple' here means'simple to construct', not 'simple to execute'.The reason for principle (ii) also follows formultilinguality; while developing analysis andsynthesis for some language, one may be ableto take into account two or three otherlanguages, but this does not hold in a caselike Eurotra, where one not only has sevenlanguages to deal with, but also the possibilityof adding languages must be kept open.Principles (i) and (ii) together constitutea philosophy that can serve as a basis for thedevelopment of a theory about the nature of therepresentations R and R t in (I).
The remainderof this paper is ~evoted to a clearer and moreuseful formulation of them.2.
Division of labour.Suppose that simple transfer is taken tomean that transfer will only substitute lexicalelements, and that the theory of representationsays that the representations are somethingin the way of syntactic structures.
We nowhave a problem in cases where translationpairs consist of texts with different syntacticstructures.
Two well-known examples are:(i) the graag-like case;Example: Dutch 'Tom zwemt graag' translatesas English 'Tom likes to swim', with syntacticstructures:(2) Dutch:Is Tom C~?zwem \ [ ;~  graag \ ]3  \](3) English:Tom~v~ l i ke~ empty \ [w~swim~In the case of Dutch-English transfer, lexicalsubstitution would result in an R t like thefollowing:(4) Possible R :Tom\[ ,~ sw im~%~,  like-to.J3\]In this way, the pair <.
(4), 'Tom likes to swim'~becomes a member of the relation GEN forEnglish.
However, it is hard to believe thatEnglish linguists will be able to accomodatesuch pairs without knowing a lot about theother languages that belong to the project.
(ii) The kenner - somebody who knows caseDutch and English both have agentive derivation,liketalk =~ talker, s~:in~ => swimmer.However, as usually, derivational processes arenot entirely regular, and so, for example thoughDutch has 'kenner', English does not have thecorresponding 'knower'.
So we have the follo-wing translation pair:(5) Dutch: 'kenner van het Turks'English: 'somebody who knows Turkish'Again, the English generation writer isin trouble if he has to know that the R tmay contain a construction like'C~now\]+er~', because this impliesknowledge about all the other languagesthat participate.The general idea is that we want to havea strictly monolingual basis for thedevelopment of the implementations of AN andGEN.
Therefore, so, we have the followingprinciple:(6) Division of labour (simple version):For each language L in the system,R ,T~GEN L iff ~T ,RY6AN LPrinciple (6) makes AN and GEN each others'mirror image', and so it becomes more probable(though it is not guaranteed) that thelinguists knowing L will understand the classof Rts they can expect.However, (6) is too strong, and may be inconflict with the idea of simple transfer.For example, if surface syntactic structureis taken as a theory of representation, then(6) implies that TRF relates source languagesurface word order to target language wordorder, which clearly involves a lot more thansubstitution of lexical elements.Therefore, the notion of isoduidy has beendeveloped.
Isoduidy is an equivalence relationbetween representations that belong to thesame language.
Literally, the word 'isoduid'(from Greek and Dutch stems) means 'sameinterpretation'; but the meaning should begeneralized to something like 'equivalentwith respect to the essence of translation'.To give an example, suppose that representationsare surface trees with various labelings,including semantic ones like thematicrelations and semantic markers.
Isodui~y mightthen be defined loosely as follows:two representations are isoduid if they havethe same vertical geometry, and the same lexicalelements and semantic labels in the correspon-ding positions.Obviously, the definition of the contents of theisoduidy relation depends on the contents ofthe representation theory.
However, we thinkthat the general idea must be clear: isoduidydefines in some general way which aspects ofrepresentations are taken to be essential fortranslation.465Given isoduidy, one can give a more sophisti-cated version of the principle of division oflabour as follows:(7) Division of labour (final version):For each language L in the system,R',T7 ~ GEN LiffKT,R7 6AN L and R' is isoduid to RAs a consequence, TRF has not to take responsibili-ty for target language specific aspects like wordorder anymore.3.
Simple and complex transfer.Given the principle of division of labour, wecan  relate to each other the following threethings:- the notion of simple transfer- the representation theory, especially, the'depth' of representation;- the contents of the relation isoduidyGiven some definition of what counts as simpletransfer, we can now see whether the represen-tation theory is compatible with it.It is easy to see that some popular theoriesof simple transfer, including the one sayingthat transfer is just substitution of lexicalelements, will now give rise to a rather 'deep'theory of representation.
This follows fromcases like 'graag-like' and 'kenner-knower',where some language happens to lack lexicalelements that others happen to have.
In suchcases, the language lacking the element usuallycircumscribes the meaning in some way.
If oneexcludes transfer other than lexical substitu-tion, such examples give rise to a theory ofrepresentation where similar circumscriptionsmust be assigned as representations in thelanguage that does have the lexical element.
So,in Dutch we get pairs in AN like'kenner', ~somebody \ [who  knows~~'Tom zwemt graag', ~ Tom graag ~ emptyzwem~ ~ ~>Instead of having deep representations likethese, one may consider the possibility thattransfer is complicated sometimes.
So, one maystill desire that transfer consists of just lexi-cal substitution most of the time, but allowexceptions.
The question then arises as to howsimple and complex transfer interact.As a basis for that, one may observe that therelation TRF now holds between representations,while in practice just lexical elements aretranslated most of the time.
A straightfowardgeneralization is possible for the case wherea representation is some hierarchical object,say some tree.
We can then introduce a newrelation, called translates-as.
This is abinary relation, probably many-to-many; itsleft-hand term is a subtree of R , and itsrighthand term is a tree.
Clearl~, TRF is asubset of translates-as.We then have the following principle:(8) Transfer translates a tree node-by-node.Note that, obviously, this only makessense as long as we have representationsthat are tree~.The following example mayclarify the idea.

~ (ilke) A (emotyi, (swim)/ \  (zwem) (swim) (graag)L M(empty) (sNim)Note that Dutch 'graag' is not translated at all;it only serves as a basis for the complextransfer elementKC,l~.The principle of simple transfer can now beformulated as follows:If A translates-as A', then we will call A'a TN of A.
We now call an element s,tof the set defined by translates-as a simpleiff.eithers and t are both terminal nodes,or(i) s is a subtree, dominated by the nonterminalnode A, and(ii) t is a tree, dominated by A', and(iii) A' is a copy of A', and(iv) the immediate daughters of A' are copiesof the TNs of the immediate daughters of A.The principle of simple transfer then says thatthe proportion of simple elements in translates-as must be maximal.The generalised relation translates-as makesit possible to put some order into complextransfer.
It localises it in a natural way,based on a tree structure.In (9), only the pair ~C, 12 is complex;all the others are simple.
This view on transferis easily implemented by means of an inbuiltstrategy that simulates recursion.4.
Conclusion.466The principle of division of labour, togetherwith the principle of node-by-node transferconstitute a framework in which it is possibleto study 'depth of representation' in asystematic way.467
