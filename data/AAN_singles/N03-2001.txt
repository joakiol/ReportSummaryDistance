The system usesthe Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm toarrange XML marked-up documents on a two-dimensional map so that similar documentsappear closer to each other.
It then employsan inductive learning algorithm C5 to auto-matically extract and apply markup rules fromthe nearest SOM neighbours of an unmarkeddocument.
The system is designed to be adap-tive, so that once a document is marked-up; itsbehaviour is modified to improve accuracy.The automatically marked-up documents areagain categorized on the Self-OrganizingMap.1 IntroductionVast amounts of information are now available in elec-tronic form to which accurate and speedy access is get-ting more difficult.
The increasing quantity ofinformation has created a need for intelligent manage-ment and retrieval techniques.
Many of the existing in-formation retrieval systems, which deal with largevolumes of documents, have poor retrieval performancebecause these systems can use a little knowledge in thedocuments.
By adopting XML as a standard documentformat, content-based queries can be performed by ex-ploiting the XML structure of the documents.
In addi-tion, specifically tagged sections of the documents canbe searched rather than the entire document, thus pro-viding fast and effective retrieval.
Furthermore, usingthe logical structure of a document created byXML markup, different types of operations can be per-formed, for example, the same content can be reused ina variety of formats, specific elements can be extractedfrom the XML documents and full documents satisfyingcertain structural conditions can be retrieved from thedatabase.
These and other advantages of using XMLmake it a complete solution for content managementand intelligent information retrieval.
However, despitethe advantages and the popularity of XML, we still donot have large repositories of XML because automaticXML markup is still a challenge and the process ofmanually marking up XML documents is complex, te-dious and expensive.
Most of the existing automaticmarkup systems are limited to certain domains and donot perform general automatic markup.
In addressingthe need for more general automatic markup of textdocuments, we present a system with a novel hybridarchitecture.
The system uses the techniques of Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm (Kohonen, 1997) andan inductive learning algorithm, C5 (Quinlan, 1993,2000).2 System overviewThe system has two phases.
The first phase of the sys-tem deals with the formation of a map of valid XML (avalid XML document is one which is well-formed andwhich has been validated against a DTD) marked-updocuments using the SOM algorithm.
The second phasedeals with the automatic markup of new (unmarked)document according to the markup of existing docu-ments.
Once a document is marked-up, the system?sbehaviour is modified to improve accuracy.
These twophases of the system are currently implemented inde-pendently but will be combined to form an integratedhybrid system.
This paper focuses on phase 2 of thesystem.Phase 2 of the system is implemented as an independ-ent automatic XML markup system, which is Figure 1.It comprises two main modules ?
a Rule extractionmodule and a Markup module.
The rule extractionmodule deals with the extraction of rules using an in-ductive learning approach (Mitchell, 1997).
Firstly,during a preliminary phase, training examples are col-lected from the valid XML marked-up documents.These documents should be from a specific domain andtheir markup should be valid and conformant to therules of a single Document Type Definition (DTD).
AnXML document consists of a strictly nested hierarchy ofelements with a root element.
Only elements havingtext nodes are considered as markup elements for oursystem.Figure 3: Automatic XML markup systemThe markup of elements nested within other elementscan be accomplished by using the DTD.
Each traininginstance corresponds to an element containing a textnode from the collection of marked-up documents.
Thetext enclosed between the start and end tags of all occur-rences of each element is encoded using a fixed-widthfeature vector.
We have used 31 features in our ex-periments.
The set of feature vectors is used by the sys-tem to learn classifiers.
An inductive learning algorithmprocesses these encoded instances to develop classifiersfor elements having specific tag names.
These classifi-ers segment the text of an unmarked document into dif-ferent elements of the resulting XML marked-updocument.
In our system, the C5 program is used tolearn classifiers.
These classifiers are later used tomarkup the segments of text as XML elements.The second module deals with the creation of XMLmarkup.
The unmarked document to be used for thisprocess should be from the same domain and shouldhave a similar structure to the documents, which wereused for learning the rules.
To accomplish the markup,the unmarked document is segmented into pieces of textusing a variety of heuristics.
These heuristics are de-rived from the set of training examples.
By using theDTD conformant to the document set used for learningthe rules and by using the text segments stored for eachelement, a hierarchical structure of the document is en-coded and the marked-up document is produced.The markup produced by the system can be validatedaccording to a DTD.
However, in order to check theaccuracy of the markup, we have to examine it manuallyand compare it with the original source (if available) asXML processors can only validate the syntax of themarkup, and not its semantics.3 PerformanceWe used documents from a number of different domainsfor our experiments, including letters from the Mac-Greevy archive (Schreibman, 1998, 2000), a database ofemployee records, Shakespearean plays (Bosak, 1998),poems from an early American encoding project, andscientific journal articles (Openly Informatics, Inc.,1999-200).
Figure 2 shows a part of a scene from ?AMidsummer Night's Dream?
as an example of XMLmarkup automatically produced by our system.
Theunderlined text was not marked up by our system.We have also evaluated our system with some of thedocument sets.
For evaluation, we considered the ele-ments representing the content of the document, and ahuman expert is required to evaluate this.
We have usedthree performance measures in evaluating the automaticmarkup process.
These measures are?
The percentage of markup elements determinedcorrectly by the system?
The percentage of markup elements determinedincorrectly by the system?
The percentage of markup elements not deter-mined by the system (i.e.
text nodes for thesemarkup elements are not present in the marked-up document produced by the system)The elements of 10 valid XML marked-up letters fromthe MacGreevy archive were used to learn C5 rules andtext segmentation heuristics.
By applying these rulesand heuristics, 55 elements of five unmarked lettersfrom the MacGreevy archive were automaticallymarked up by the system with 96% accuracy (we usethe term  ?accuracy?
here to mean the number ofmarked-up elements correctly determined by the sys-tem).
Similarly, elements of 5 valid XML marked-upShakespeare plays were used as training examples and13882 elements of four Shakespearean plays wereautomatically marked-up by the system.
In this case theaccuracy rate was 92%.

marked up by our system4 ConclusionWe have described a system with a novel hybrid archi-tecture that uses an inductive learning approach to per-form automatic markup of text documents.
The systemautomatically marks up documents by capturing markupinformation from the neighbouring documents on aSelf-Organizing Map.
Such marked-up documents canbe used for management and retrieval purposes accord-ing to the structural information they contain.
The re-sults from our experiments demonstrate that ourapproach is practical and that our system provides anovel approach for automatically marking up textdocuments in XML.
The functionality of our systemmakes it a useful tool for electronic information ex-change.AcknowledgementsThe support of the Informatics Research Initiative ofEnterprise Ireland is gratefully acknowledged.
