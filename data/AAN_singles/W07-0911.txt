The specialisedlanguage often associated with CH contentintroduces problems for automatic transla-tion to support search applications.
TheMultiMatch project is focused on enablingusers to interact with CH content acrossdifferent media types and languages.
Wepresent results from a MultiMatch study ex-ploring various translation techniques forthe CH domain.
Our experiments ex-amine translation techniques for the En-glish language CLEF 2006 Cross-LanguageSpeech Retrieval (CL-SR) task using Span-ish, French and German queries.
Re-sults compare effectiveness of our querytranslation against a monolingual baselineand show improvement when combining adomain-specific translation lexicon with astandard machine translation system.1 IntroductionOnline Cultural Heritage (CH) content is being pro-duced in many countries by organisations such asnational libraries, museums, galleries and audiovi-sual archives.
Additionally, there are increasingamounts of CH relevant content available more gen-erally on the World Wide Web.
While some of thismaterial concerns national or regional content onlyof local interest, much material relates to items in-volving multiple nations and languages, for exam-ple concerning events in Europe or Asia.
In order togain a full understanding of such events, includingdetails contained in different collections and explor-ing different cultural perspectives requires effectivemultilingual search technologies.
Facilitating searchof this type requires translation tools to cross the lan-guage barrier between users and the available infor-mation sources.CH content encompasses various different media,including of course text documents, images, videos,and audio recordings.
Search of text documents be-tween languages forms the focus of cross-languageinformation retrieval (CLIR) research, while searchfor images is the concern of content-based image re-trieval.
However, whatever the media of the itemsthey are accompanied by metadata.
Such metadatamay include simple factual details such as date ofcreation, but also descriptive details relating to thecontents of the item.
Multilingual searching usingmetadata content requires that either the metadatabe translated into a language with which the user isable to search or that the search query be translatedinto the language of the metadata.
This alternativeof document or query translation is a well rehearsedargument in CLIR, which has generally concerneditself with full text document searching.
However,the features of metadata require a more careful anal-ysis.
Metadata is typically dense in search terms,while lacking the linguistic structure and informa-tion redundancy of full text documents.
The absenceof linguistic structure makes precise translation ofcontent problematic, while the lack of redundancymeans that accurate translation of individual words81and phrases is vital to minimise mismatch betweenquery and document terms.
Furthermore, CH con-tent is typically in specialised domains requiring do-main specific resources for accurate translation.
De-veloping reliable and robust approaches to transla-tion for metadata search is thus an important com-ponent of search for many CH archives.The EU FP6 MultiMatch1 project is concernedwith information access for multimedia and multi-lingual content for a range of European languages.In the investigation reported in this paper we intro-duce the first stage multilingual search functional-ity of the MultiMatch system, and describe its usein an investigation for multilingual metadata search.Since at present we do not have a search test collec-tion specifically developed for MultiMatch we usedata from the CLEF 2006 Cross-Language SpeechRetrieval (CL-SR) task for our experiments (Oard etal., 2006).The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-lows: Section 2 gives an overview of the MultiMatchsearch architecture, Section 3 outlines the experi-mental search task, Section 4 describes the trans-lation resources used for this study, Section 5 and6 concern our experimental setup and results, andfinally Section 7 summarises our conclusions andgives details of our ongoing work.2 MultiMatch Search SystemThe MultiMatch search system is centered on theMILOS Multimedia Repository system (Amato etal., 2004) which incorporates free-text search usingLucene (Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2004) and im-age search using an open source image retrieval sys-tem GIFT (Mu?ller et al, 2001).
In order to supportmultilingual searching a number of translation toolsare being developed based on standard online ma-chine translation tools and dictionaries augmentedwith domain-specific resources gathered from theWWW and elsewhere.
In this section we briefly in-troduce the relevant details of MILOS and Lucene.Since this paper focuses on text search within Mul-tiMatch, we do not describe the multimedia featuresof the MultiMatch system.1www.multimatch.org2.1 MILOS: Multimedia RepositoryMILOS (Multimedia dIgital Library for On-lineSearch) is a repository system conceived to supportthe distributed storage and retrieval of multimediaobjects.
This Multimedia Content Management Sys-tem (MCMS) is able to manage not only structureddata, as in databases, but also textual data (usinginformation retrieval technologies), semi-structureddata (typically in XML), mixed-mode data, and mul-timedia data.
In MultiMatch, we use MILOS as ametadata repository to enable querying on the struc-ture of the data stored.MILOS has a three-tier architecture composed ofthree main components:1. the XML Search Engine (XMLSE) componentwhich manages the metadata;2. the MultiMedia Server (MMS) componentwhich manages the documents; and3.
the MultiMedia Digital Library service(MMDLS) component MMDLS which pro-vides application developers with a uniformand integrated way of accessing MMS andXMLSE.Each of these components is implemented usingsolutions providing flexibility, scalability, and effi-ciency.2.1.1 XMLSEXMLSE is an enhanced native XMLdatabase/repository system with special featuresfor digital library applications.
This is especiallyjustified by the well known and accepted advantagesof representing metadata as XML documents.Metadata represented with XML can have arbitrarycomplex structures, which allows it to handle withcomplex metadata schemas, and can easily beexported and imported.
Our XML database canstore and retrieve any valid XML document.
Nometadata schema or XML schema definition isneeded before inserting an XML document, exceptoptional index definitions for performance boosting.Once an arbitrary XML document has been insertedin the database it can be immediately retrieved usingXQuery.
This allows digital library applications touse arbitrary (XML encoded) metadata schemas82and to deal with heterogeneous metadata, withoutany constraint on schema design and/or overheaddue to metadata translation.
Thus, the native XMLdatabase/repository system is simpler than a generalpurpose XML database system, but offers signif-icant improvements in specific areas: it supportsstandard XML query languages such as XPath andXQuery, and offers advanced search and indexingfunctionality on arbitrary XML documents.
Itsupports high performance search and retrieval onheavily structured XML documents, relying onspecific index structures.Moreover XMLSE provides the possibility of us-ing particular indexes.
For example, using the con-figuration file of XMLSE the system administratorcan associate the <abstract> elements of a doc-ument with a full-text index and to the MPEG-7<VisualDescriptor> elements can be associatedwith a similarity search index.
XMLSE uses ApacheLucene2 to provide partial (or approximate) textstring matching, effectively providing informationretrieval functionality within MILOS.
This allowsXMLSE to use the ranked searching and wildcardqueries of Lucene to solve queries like ?find all thearticles whose title contains the word XML?
andso on.
This application allows users to interrogatethe dataset combining full text, and exact or partialmatch search.
For example the user can look fordocuments whose <metadata> element contains theword ?Switzerland?.
MILOS generates and submitsto XMLSE the following XQuery query:for $a in /document where$a//metadata ?
?Switzerland?return<result>{$a//title}, {$a//author}</result>The query will return a list of results which con-sist of the title and author of all documents whosemetadata contains the term ?Switzerland?.2.2 LuceneFull text search in MILOS is provided by usingLucene as a plugin.
Ranked retrieval uses thestandard tf ?
idf vector-space method provided inLucene (Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2004).
Lucenealso provides additional functionality to improve re-2http://lucene.apache.orgtrieval effectiveness by providing various query ex-pansion services using techniques such as relevancefeedback, although these are not used in the currentinvestigation.
Documents and search requests arepreprocessed to remove stop words and stemming isapplied using the standard resources supplied withLucene.3 Evaluation TaskThe MultiMatch system will enable search from anumber of CH repository sources including formallypublished documents, images and video, as wellas material gathered from relevant WWW sources.However, in order to explore metadata search is-sues and evaluate our approaches to addressing re-lated translation problems, a test collection includ-ing sample user search topics and relevance judge-ments is required.
Since MultiMatch does not yethave such a collection available, for our current ex-periments we made use of the data provided for theCLEF 2006 CL-SR track (Oard et al, 2006).The document collection comprises 8104 En-glish documents that are manually-determinedtopically-coherent segments taken from 272 in-terviews with Holocaust survivors, witnesses andrescuers, totaling 589 hours of speech.
Sev-eral automatic speech recognition transcripts areavailable for these interviews.
However, for thisstudy we focus on the metadata fields providedfor each document: two sets of 20 automati-cally assigned keywords (<AUTOKEYWORD2004A1>and <AUTOKEYWORD2004A2>) determined using twodifferent kNN classifiers, denoted by AKW1 andAKW2 respectively; a set of a varying number ofmanually-assigned keywords (<MANUALKEYWORD>),denoted by MKW; and a manual three-sentencesummary written by an expert in the field(<SUMMARY>), denoted by SUMMARY.The CLEF collection includes a set of 33 searchtopics in standard TREC format created in English,and translated into Czech, German, French, andSpanish by native speakers.
Since we wish to in-vestigate topics with minimal redundancy, for ourexperiments we used only the topic Title fields asour search request.
Relevance judgments were gen-erated using a search guided procedure and standardpooling methods were also provided with the collec-83tion.
Full details of the this collection can be foundin (Oard et al, 2006; White et al, 2005).To explore metadata field search, we used variousmethods, described in the next section, to automati-cally translate the French, German, and Spanish top-ics into English3.4 Translation TechniquesThe MultiMatch translation resources are based onthe WorldLingo machine translation system aug-mented with domain-specific dictionary resourcesgathered automatically from the WWW.
This sectionbriefly reviews WorldLingo4, and then describesconstruction of our augmentation translation lexi-cons and their application for query translation inmultilingual metadata search.4.1 Machine translation systemThere are a number of commercial machine transla-tion systems currently available.
After evaluation ofseveral candidate systems, WorldLingo was selectedfor the MultiMatch project because it generally givesgood translation well between the English, Spanish,Italian, and Dutch, languages relevant to the Mul-timatch project5.
In addition, it provides a usefulAPI that can be used to translate queries on the flyvia HTTP transfer protocol.
The usefulness of sucha system is that it can be integrated into any appli-cation and present translations in real-time.
It al-lows users to select the source/target languages andspecify the text format (e.g.
plain text file or htmlfile) of their input files.
The WorldLingo translationsystem also provides various domain-specific dictio-naries that can be integrated with translation system.A particularly useful feature of WorldLingo with re-spect to for MultiMatch, and potentially applicationswithin CH in general, is that to improve the qual-ity of translations, additional locally developed cus-tomized dictionaries can be uploaded.
This enablesthe WorldLingo dictionaries to be extended to con-tain special terms for a specific domain.3Due to a lack of translation resources, we did not use theCzech translations in these experiments4http://www.worldlingo.com/5Additionally, it translates well between French and En-glish, as used in this paper4.2 Translation lexicon constructionTo extend the standard dictionaries provided withWorldLingo we used the current online wikipedia.Wikipedia6 is the largest multilingual free-contentencyclopedia on the Internet.
As of March 21 2007,there are approximately 6.8 million articles writtenin 250 languages available on the web, accordingto Wiki Stats7.
Wikipedia is structured as an in-terconnected network of articles.
Each wikipediapage can hyperlink to several other wikipedia pages.Wikipedia page titles in one language are also linkedto a multilingual database of corresponding terms.Unlike the web, most hyperlinks in wikipedia havea more consistent and semantically meaningful in-terpretation and purpose.
The comprehensive liter-ature review presented by Adafre and Rijke (2005)describes the link structure of wikipedia.
As a mul-tilingual hypertext medium, wikipedia presents avaluable new source of translation information.
Re-cently, researchers have proposed techniques to ex-ploit this opportunity.
Adafre and Rijke (2006) de-veloped a technique to identify similar text acrossmultiple languages in wikipedia using page content-based features.
Boumaet et al (2006) utilizedwikipedia for term recognition and translation inorder to enhance multilingual question answeringsystems.
Declerck et al (2006) showed how thewikipedia resource can be used to support the su-pervised translation of ontology labels.In order to improve the effectiveness of multilin-gual metadata search, we mine wikipedia pages asa translation source and construct translation lex-icons that can be used to reduce the errors intro-duced by unknown terms (single words and multi-word phrases) during query translation.
The majordifference in our proposal is that the translations areextracted on the basis of hyperlinks, meta keywords,and emphasized concepts ?
e.g.
anchor text, bold-face text, italics text, and text within special punc-tuation marks ?
appearing in the first paragraph ofwikipedia articles.Meta keywords Wikipedia pages typically containmeta keywords assigned by page editors.
Thismeta keywords can be used to assist in the iden-6http://www.wikipedia.org/7http://s23.org/wikistats/wikipediashtml.php?sort=good desc84tification of the associated terms on the sametopic.Emphasized concepts In common with standardsummarization studies, we observed that thefirst paragraph of a wikipedia document is usu-ally a concise introduction to the article.
Thus,concepts emphasized in the introductory sec-tion are likely to be semantically related to thetitle of the page.In our study we seek to use these features frommultilingual wikipedia pages to compile a domain-specific word and phrase translation lexicon.
Ourmethod in using this data is to augment the querieswith topically related terms in the document lan-guage through a process of post-translation queryexpansion.
This procedure was performed as fol-lows:1.
An English vocabulary for the domain of thetest collection was constructed by performing alimited crawl of the English wikipedia8, Cate-gory:World War II.
This category contains linksto pages and subcategories concerning events,persons, places, and organizations pertainingto war crimes or crimes against humanity es-pecially during WWII.
It should be noted thatthis process was neither an exhaustive crawlnor a focused crawl.
The purpose of our cur-rent study is to explore the effect of translationexpansion on metadata retrieval effectiveness.In total, we collected 7431 English web pages.2.
For each English wikipedia page, we extractedits hyperlinks to German, Spanish, and French.The basename of each hyperlink is consideredas a term (single word or multi-word phrasethat should be translated as a unit).
This pro-vided a total of 4446 German terms, 3338Spanish terms, and 4062 French terms.
As analternative way of collecting terms in German,Spanish, and French, we are able to crawl thewikipedia in a specific language.
However, apage with no link pointing to its English coun-terpart will not provide enough translation in-formation.8en.wikipedia.orgRUN IDAugmented lexicon using all termsappearing in the following fieldsTitle Meta Emphasizedterms keywords conceptsRUNmt+t??

?RUNmt+m+c ??
?Table 1: Run descriptions.3.
For each of the German, Spanish, and Frenchterms obtained, we used the title term, the metakeywords, and the emphasized concepts ob-tained from the same English wikipedia pageas its potential translations.For example, consider an English page titled as?World War II?9.
The title term, the meta keywords,the emphasized concepts in English, and the hyper-links (to German, Spanish, and French) associatedare shown in Figure 1.
We first extract the base-names ?Zweiter Weltkrieg?
(in German), ?SegundaGuerra Mundial?
(in Spanish), and ?Seconde Guerremondiale?
(in French) using the hyperlink feature.To translate these terms into English, we replacethem using the English title term, all the Englishmeta keywords and/or all the English emphasizedconcepts occurring in the same English wikipediapage.
This is a straightforward approach to au-tomatic post-translation query expansion by usingmeta keywords and/or emphasized concepts as ex-panded terms.
The effects of the features describedabove are investigated in this work, both separatelyand in combination, as shown in Table 1,5 Experimental SetupIn this section we outline the design of our exper-iments.
We established a monolingual reference(RUNmono) against which we can measure multilin-gual retrieval effectiveness.
To provide a baselinefor our multilingual results, we used the standardWorldLingo to translate the queries (RUNmt).
Wethen tested the MT integrated with different lexiconscompiled using wikipedia.
Results of these experi-ments, shown in Table 1, enable us gauge the effectof each of our additional translation resources gen-erated using wikipedia.9http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World WarII85Title: World War IIHyperlink to German: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zweiter_WeltkriegHyperlink to Spanish: http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segunda_Guerra_MundialHyperlink to French: http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seconde_Guerre_mondialeMeta keywords:World War II, WWII history by nation, WWII history by nation, 101st AirborneDivision, 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland, 15th Army Group,1937, 1939, 1940Emphasized concepts:World War II (abbreviated WWII), or the Second World War, was a worldwide conflictwhich lasted from 1939 to 1945.
World War II was the amalgamation of twoconflicts, one starting in Asia as the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the otherbeginning in Europe with the Invasion of Poland.
The war was caused by theexpansionist and hegemonic ambitions of Germany, Italy, and Japan and economictensions between all major powers.Figure 1: Title, hyperlinks, meta keywords, and emphasized concepts (underlined terms) extracted from theEnglish wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World War II.The focus of this paper is not on optimising ab-solute retrieval performance, but rather to explorethe usefulness of our translation resources.
Thuswe do not apply retrieval enhancement techniquessuch as relevance feedback which would make itmore difficult to observe the impact of differencesin behaviour of the translation resources.
The ex-periments use the SUMMARY field, as an exam-ple of concise natural language descriptions of CHobjects; and the AKW1 and AKW2 fields as exam-ples of automatically assigned keyword labels with-out linguistic structure, with the MKW field provid-ing similar manually assigned for keyword labels.Retrieval effectiveness is evaluated using standardTREC mean average precision (MAP) and the pre-cision at rank 10 (P@10).6 Results and DiscussionThe results of our query translation experiments areshown in Table 2, 3, 4, and 5.
For search using SUM-MARY and MKW fields, the lexicon compiled us-ing title terms provided an improvement of 7?
9%,7 ?
19%, and 20 ?
30%, in German?English,Spanish?English, and French?English retrieval task,respectively.
These improvements are statisticallysignificant at the 95% confidence level, and empha-size the importance of a good domain-specific trans-lation lexicon.The addition of meta keywords or emphasizedconcepts also improves results in most cases relativeto the RUNmt results.
However, we can see that re-trieval performance degrades when the query is ex-panded to contain terms from both meta keywordsand emphasized concepts.
This occurs despite thefact that the additional terms are often closely re-lated to the original query terms.
While the additionof all these terms generally produces an increase inthe number of retrieved documents, there is little orno increase in the number of relevant documents re-trieved, and the combination of the two sets of termsin the queries leads on average to a slight reduce inthe rank of relevant documents.The results show that RUNmt+t runs provide thebest results when averaged across a query set.
How-ever, when analysed at the level of individual queriesdifferent combined translation resources are moreeffective for different queries, examples of this ef-fect are shown in Table 6.
This suggests that it maybe possible to develop a more sophisticated transla-tion expansion methods to select the best terms fromdifferent lexicons.
At the very least, it should be pos-sible to use ?context-sensitive filtering?
and ?com-bination of evidence?
(Smets, 1990) approaches toimprove the overall translation quality.
We plan toexplore this method in further investigations.7 Conclusion and Future WorkThis paper reports experiments with techniques de-veloped for domain-specific lexicon construction tofacilitate multilingual metadata search for a CH re-86RUN ID German?English Spanish?English French?EnglishMAP P@10 MAP P@10 MAP P@10RUNmt 0.0750 0.1233 0.0756 0.1250 0.0652 0.1152RUNmt+t 0.0815 0.1516 0.0899 0.1545 0.0783 0.1333RUNmt+m 0.0775 0.1266 0.0797 0.1364 0.0690 0.1030RUNmt+c 0.0669 0.1000 0.0793 0.1303 0.0770 0.1152RUNmt+m+c 0.0668 0.0968 0.0737 0.1212 0.0646 0.0970RUNmono MAP = 0.1049 P@10 = 0.1818Table 2: Results for SUMMARY field search.

)trieval tasks.
The results show that our techniquescan provide a statistically significant improvementin the retrieval effectiveness.
Using a tailored trans-lation lexicon enables us to achieve (77%, 78%),(86%, 67%) and (75%, 63%) of the monolingual ef-fectiveness in German?English, Spanish?English,and French?English multilingual metadata SUM-MARY, MKW field search tasks.
In addition, themultilingual wikipedia proved to be a rich resourceof translations for domain-specific terms.Intuitively, document translation is superior toquery translation.
Documents provide more contextfor resolving ambiguities (Oard, 1998) and the trans-lation of source documents into all the languagessupported by the retrieval system effectively reducesCLIR to a monolingual IR task.
Furthermore, it hasthe added advantage that document content is acces-sible to users in their native languages.
In our futurework, we will compare the effectiveness of these twoapproaches to metadata search in a multilingual en-vironment.87Query IDMT Augmented lexicon using all terms appearing in the following fieldsWorldLingo Title terms Meta keyword Emphasized concepts Meta keyword +Emphasized conceptsGerman?English 1133 0.6000 0.6000 0.6195 0.6092 0.64001325 0.0000 0.0003 0.0020 0.0020 0.00181623 0.2210 0.2210 0.3203 0.0450 0.07633007 0.0000 0.0003 0.0025 0.0047 0.00543012 0.0087 0.0087 0.0073 0.0073 0.00973025 0.0052 0.0052 0.0060 0.0052 0.0060Spanish?English 1623 0.0063 0.0063 0.1014 0.0084 0.03343007 0.0000 0.0004 0.0028 0.0048 0.0057French?English 1133 0.6000 0.6000 0.6195 0.6092 0.64001345 0.0600 0.0667 0.0809 0.0495 0.04201623 0.0750 0.0798 0.1810 0.0228 0.05283005 0.0200 0.0232 0.0226 0.2709 0.10633007 0.0003 0.0003 0.0024 0.0025 0.00373025 0.0173 0.0173 0.0178 0.0173 0.0178Table 6: Examples of MAP values obtained using different translation combinations for SUMMARY fieldsearch.
