Russian Morphology: Resources and Java Software Applications.Serge YablonskyPetersburg Transport University, Moscow av., 9, St.-Petersburg, 190031, Russia,Russicon Company, Kazanskaya str., 56, ap.2, 190000, Russiaserge_yablonsky@hotmail.com; root@russicon.spb.su;http://www.russicon.ruAbstractThis paper deals with development and applica-tion of Russian morphology software and re-sources.
The approach is particularly dependenton advanced morphological analysis.
The paperpresents the structure, formats and content ofRussian dictionaries and corpora.
Relevant as-pects of the UML data models, XML format andrelated technologies are surveyed.
We introdu-cee the system based on Java and Oracle 9iDBMS.1 IntroductionUp-to-date language technologies contain effi-cient morphological analyzers for Romance,Germanic (Karttunen, 1983; Karttunen, Kosken-niemi, Kaplan, 1987; Zaenen, Uszkoreit, 1996)and some Slavic (Chanod, 1997) languages.
Inthe last 15 years Russian computational mor-phology has advanced at a great rate from firstquite restricted systems towards large-scalepractical morphological analyzers ( AshmanovI., 1995; Belonogov, Zelenkov, 1989; Belyaev,Surcis, Yablonsky, 1993; Bolshakov, 1990;Mikheev, Liubushkina, 1995; Segalovich, 1995).This paper attempts to introduce results of 15years ongoing project on developing of Russianresources and software for building advanceRussian language morphological analyzers andtheir applications that enable a different forms oftext indexing and retrieval, and a direct benefitfrom the Russian morphological analyzers in:?
information-acquisition tools,?
authoring tools,?
language-learning tools,?
translation-tools,?
summarizers,?
semantic web etc.The objectives of this project are not unique.Several analogous projects have been carried outto different stages.
In the late eighties of XXcentury we developed one of the first Russianmorphologic analyzers on PC (Yablonsky S.,1990; Belyaev  B.M.,  Surcis A.S.,  YablonskyS.A., 1993; Yablonsky  S.A., 1998; YablonskyS.A., 1999).
Now we are developing a set ofplatform independent Internet/Intranet Russianlanguage processing tools based on Java andOracle technologies.2 Russian Resources for MorphologyRussicon company has such main counterparts(Yablonsky S.A., 1998) for Russian morphologysoftware development:- Russian lexicon which is formed from theintersection of the perfect set of RussiconRussian grammatical dictionaries with in-flection paradigms (200.000 paradigms thatproduce more then 6.000.000 inflectionword forms).
It includes:?
Russian basic grammatical dic-tionary.?
Computer dictionary.?
Geographical names dictionary.?
Russian personal names, patro-nymics and surnames diction-ary.?
Business dictionary.?
Juridical dictionary.?
Jargon dictionary.- Russicon Russian explanatory dictionary.The dictionary gives the broad lexical repre-sentation of the Russian language of the endof the XX century.
More then 100 000 con-temporary entries include new words, idi-oms and their meanings from the languageof the Eighties-Nineties.
The dictionary isdistinguished by its complete set of entryword characteristics, clear understandabledefinitions, its guidance on usage.
All dic-tionary information for entries is structuredin more then 60 attributes:?
entry word;?
multiple word entries;?
usage notes;?
precise, contemporary defini-tions;?
derivations;?
example sentences/citations;?
idioms etc.- Russicon Russian thesaurus (set of 11.000Russian synsets).
Synonym list (8 696 syno-nym rows) plus word list containing ap-proximately 30 000 normalized entry wordswith  inflection paradigms.- Russicon Russian Orthographic diction-ary (100 000 normalized entry words plusinflection paradigms with stresses).- Russian WordNet (in development).- Russian Corpora.
Today linguistically en-coded Russian text corpus includes ap-proximately 2 000 000 words and consist ofanthology of Russian prose and poetry of the20th century, law, business and  newspapers.The texts were input from printed resourcesand Internet (Yablonsky S.A., 1998; 2000).3 General Set Model of Inflection Mor-phologyIn most language technology applications theencoded linguistic knowledge, i.e.
the grammar,is separated from the processing components(Zaene, Uszkoreit, 1996).
Linguistic Model(LM) of the language consists of all declarativeknowledge about the language, which is concen-trated in the set of dictionaries and linguistictables.
The number of word forms P for Slavicinflection languages is rather high (P>>1) forsome parts of speech.
For example, in Russianlanguage P > 100 for verbs.For the formal description of inflection mor-phology model the set theory is used.
It is one ofthe best ways for description of inflection mor-phology (Bider, Bolshakov, 1976), (Kulagina,1986).
We present the general set model thatpermits to define mostly all sides of inflectionmorphology.
It is realized in the Russian andUkrainian morphological analyzers.
In thismodel some concepts for the first time and otherhave new or more full meaning.
We use defini-tions from (Yablonsky, 1999).Let H = { h1, h2, ?
, hNh } be the set of part-of-speech (pos) categories and P = { p1, p2, ?
, pNp} ?
lexical categories (LC) of gender, numberetc.Each element pi ?
P, where i = 1,Np , representsthe set of concrete realizations of lexical cate-gory pi  = {pi,1, pi,2, ?
,pi,Ni}.Let us chose one element in P (for definitenessp1) named type and denoted by T (T = p1,T ?
P), T = {t1, t2,?, tNt}.For example, Russian language model includes:H1 = {h1 = "noun", h2 = "adjective",h32 = "verb", h4 = "particle", h5 = "parentheticword", h6 = "modal word", h7 = "adverb",h8 = "conjunction", h9 = "interjection", h10= "preposition", h11  = "abbreviation",h12 = "unit of measure", h13 = "pronoun",h14 = "numeral", h15 = "adverbial participle?,h16 = "composition or special prefix"}.
P ={p1 = "case", p2 = "gender", p3 = "number",p4 = "time", p5 = "person", p6 = "degree",p7 = "voice", p8 = "aspect", p9 = "mood",p10 = "form", p11 = "transitivity",p12 = "reflexive", p13 = "animate"},where p1 =  {"nominative", "genitive", "dative","accusative", "instrumental", "prepositional"},p2 =  {"masculine", "feminine", "neuter", mas-culine/feminine"},  p3 = {"singular", "plural "},p4 = {"present", "past", future", present / future"}, p5 = {"1st person", "2nd person", "3rd per-son "}, p6 = {"superlative", "comparative"},p7 = {"active ", "passive"}, p8 = {"imperfec-tive", "perfective", "perfective and imperfec-tive"}, p9 = {"indicative", "imperative"}, p10 ={"full", "short (predicative)", "infinitive"},p11 =  {"transitive ", "intransitive"}, p12 = {"re-flexive", "irrevocable"}, p13 = {"animate", "in-animate"}.
We take that (?hk : hk?H) (?Tk : Tk?
T, Tk ?
?
), i.e.
at least one type exists for each1 Our model for Russian slightly differs from the classic: we in-clude in the sets H and P some additional elements.2 In the paradigm of the verb we include participle and adverbialparticiple.part of speech and is named ordinary, and alsoTk  = {tk,1, tk,2, ?
, tk,Nk}, where k = 1,Nh .For example, in Russian for h1 = "noun", T1 ={"ordinary", "invariable", "substantival"}.
For(hk, tk,j) = ("noun", "ordinary"): P1k,t = {"gen-der"}, P2k,t = {"case","number"}, P3k,t ={"animate"}, Xk,t = (X*k,t = {"nominativecase", "singular number"}, {"genitive case","singular number"}, {"dative case", "singularnumber"}, {"accusative case", "singular num-ber"}, {"instrumental case", "singular number"},{"prepositional case", "singular number"},{"nominative case", "plural number"}, {"geni-tive case", "plural number"}, {"dative case","plural  number"}, {"accusative case", "pluralnumber"}, {"instrumental case", "plural num-ber"}, {"prepositional case", "plural number"},{"2-nd genitive case", "singular  number"}, {"2-nd instrumental case", "singular  number"}, {"2-nd prepositional case", "singular  number"}, {"2-nd accusative case", "singular  number"}, {"2-ndaccusative case", "plural number"}).Then(?hk?tk,j : hk?H, tk,j?Tk, k=1,Nh , j=1,Nk ) (?Pk,t : Pk,t ?
P,tNkk=1Nh=1UU Pk,t = P ),i.e.
for each part of speech exists it's own, maybe empty, set of LC.
Elements of Pk,t are namedLC of t-type hk.
For all Pk,t  exists partition onthree nonoverlapping and may be empty subsets,named P1k,t, P2k,t, P3k,t:(?Pk,t : Pk,t?P) (?P1k,t?P2k,t?P3k,t :P1k,tU P2k,tU P3k,t=Pk,t , P1k,tI P2k,tI P3k,t = ?
).Elements of P1k,t are named as ordinary LC, ele-ments of P2k,t ?
special LC, elements of P3k,t ?individual LC of t-type hk.
For each Pk,t set, if Pk,t?
?, there exists ordered sequence of sets Xk,t =(X1k,t, X2k,t, ?
, XNxktk,t).
That is, if P2k,t = {p2k,t,1,p2k,t,2, ?
, p2k,t,Nkt2}, then Xlk,t = {x,j : x,j ?
p2k,t,i, i= 1, Nkt2 }, where l = 1,Nxkt , and if P2k,t = ?,then it is considered that Xk,t = (?
).We shall call sequence Xk,t s the sequence oflexical categories of word inflective paradigm oft-type hk.
One of lexical categories, usually thefirst, is named X*t,k  and called normalized.There exists a single pair (hk,tk,j), (hk?H, tk,j?Tk,k = 1,Nh , j = 1,Nk ) for every lexeme and,therefore, ordered list of LC  Xk,t.Let us define function fl?W(l), l = 1, Nx ,withrange of values W'I = WI ?
{?
}, where ?
?dummy, nonexistent word form.
Thereby, forevery lexeme WI an ordered sequence of word-forms YWi = (y1, y2,  ?
, yNx) (yj?WI forj = 1,Nx ) could be formed.
Such sequence iscalled word changing paradigm of lexeme  Wi(WCP).
If for lexeme WI exists such l, thatfl?W(l) = ?,  it is said that lexeme WI has adummy word changing paradigm (Apresyan,1989).If the pair (hk, tk,j) corresponds to lexeme WI andfor some l = l* from 1,Nx  conditions: fl?X(l*) =X*k,t   and   y* = fl?W (l*) (y*?YWi, y*??
), arefulfilled, then we shall call the word form y* asnormalized form or lemma of lexeme Wi.
Usuallyy* = y1.
As a rule, infinitive is a lemma for theverb etc.Let YWi ?
WCP of lexeme Wi.
Then word form'sinflections of paradigm YWi form ordered se-quence denoted by YFLCi.
Inflection class (FC)number I denoted by FCI is the five:FCI = < hk, tk,j, P1k,t, Xk,t, YFLCi > (1),where hk ?
some part of speech; tk,j ?
some reali-zation of LC type for corresponding part ofspeech; P1k,t ?
ordinary LC, corresponding to tk,j;Xk,t ?
sequence of special LC of WCP, corre-sponding to tk,j; YFLCi ?
some I-th sequence ofinflections, also called WCP of FC, where|Xk,t| = |YFLCi|.
Inflection class concept was firstused by (Belonogov, Zelenkov, 1985), althoughinflection class was understood only as orderedsequence of inflections.Let for lexeme W  WIS* = (b*1, b*2, ?
,b*NWIS*) and exists WISm = ( b1, b2, ?
, bNWIS),where m = 1?|Xk,t|, such, that WISm ?
WIS*.Consequently, exists natural number N0,N0 = 0?min (NWIS, NWIS*), such, that (b*1, b*2,?
, b*No) = (b1, b2, ?
, bNo); (b*No+1, ?
,b*NWIS*) ?
(bNo+1, ?
, bNWIS).
Let us call the or-dered sequence zsI,m = ((bNo+1, ?
, bNWIS),(b*No+1, ?
, b*NWIS*)), allowing to obtain lemmaWIS  from some word form WIS, direct substi-tution.
Here I is a FC number, m ?
positionnumber in WIS FC, s ?
exact pair numberamong other pairs in the m-th position.
For eachI-th FC is defined ordered set ZI (may be empty):ZI = {zI,1, zI,2, ?
, zI,Nzi}, ???
Nzi = |Xk,t|.
EachzI,m= {z1I,m, z2I,m, ?
, zNzimI,m}, wherem = 1?|Xk,t|, also is a set of pairs of direct substi-tutions (may be empty).
If the pair zsI,m = (bm,b*)is a direct substitution, then the pair (b*,bm) iscalled reverse substitution.
Reverse substitutionallows obtaining some m-th word form WISfrom lemma WIS.
There is one-to one corre-spondence between the sets B* = {?, b*, ?
}and Bm = {?, bm, ?}.
Thus, |B*| = |Bm|; if (b*,bm1) and (b*, bm2), then bm1= bm2; if (b*1, bm) and(bm, b*2) , then b*1= b*2.
The letters from theconstant part of WIS could be added to the be-ginnings of such character sequences forachievement of this term.For example, the genitive of the plural noun???????
(copeck) with lexeme WIS* =(??????)
is WIS 7 = (??????).
Direct sub-stitution should be (?
?, ??
), but for the lexemeof the same inflexion class (FC = 154)????????
(kitty or pellet or pool) direct sub-stitution in the same position must be (?
?, ??
).This generates ambiguity.
Therefore, two pairsof direct substitutions: (??
?, ???)
?(??
?, ???)
are formed in the morphologymodel for inflexion class 154 and m = 7.
Thus,for some inflection classes the set of direct sub-stitutions should be formed.So, for obtaining word form of WCP with givenLC it is enough to define WIS of the lemma,number of the inflexion class and the number ofword form in WCP, thus the three < WIS*, FC,l>.
If  Yl  = '?
', then for given FC and, accord-ingly, for given lexeme the word form with suchLC does not exist.
However, even if Yl ?
'?
',paradigm of the given lexeme could be dummy.Such situation is described with the help of theset P3k,t of individual LC of given lexeme.For example, lexemes ????????
(do) and?????????
have the same inflection class 175and, hence, the same realization of ordinary andspecial LC, but they have different value of as-pect: verb ????????
?
imperfective aspect,verb ?????????
?
perfective aspect.
So LCaspect should be the individual LC for this pair.Additionally, the individual LC could imposerestriction on the existence of some inlections ofthe word.
In the above example for FC = 175FLC44 = ????
?
Z175,44 = (???
?, ~), where sign'~' designates empty sequence.
For the verb????????
WIS* = ??????
?
y44 = ?????-?????.
For the verb ?????????
: WIS* =???????
?
y44 = ???????????.
Thiscontradicts with Russian language standard.So in the morphologic model should be the rules?rejecting?
some inflection forms accordingtheir individual LC information.
Such exclusionfor given lexeme could be set explicitly by indi-cating the number of concrete inflection.For example, for lexeme ???????
(dream)there is no y8 ?
plural genitive inflection.
The setof individual LC realizations of lexeme inflec-tions and numbers of forbidden inflections ofWIP are considered to be individual feature oflexeme and are marked by I.Thus, LC of every lexeme Wi could be given bythree:Wi = < WIS*i, FC, Ii >.
(2)Linguistic tables (LT) form the second counter-part of the model FC (1).
The structure of eachLT depends on its utility type.
For example, letus describe LT of ordinary LC (table of inflec-tion classes).
Table structure is simple:TableFC?FLC = { <FC1,Lc1>, <FC2Lc2>,?,<FCm,Lcm>},where m ?
general number of FC; Lc ?
8-bitcode of general LC.The interpretation of general LC in 8-bit code(d1,?d8) is like this: 4 low digits (d1-d4) de-pend on the value of 4 high digits (d5-d8) thatdistinguish part of speech.
For example, the val-ues d1=0, d2=0, d3=0, d4=0 define a noun,d1=0, d2=0, d3=0, d4=1 ?
an adjective.
Fornouns other 4 bits could be interpreted as thus:d7=1, d8=0 ?
ordinary noun, d7=0, d8=1 ?
sub-stantial noun, d7=1, d8=1 ?unchangeable noun.Bits d5, d6 are defined  only for ordinary nounsand define gender p2 = {{"masculine", "femi-nine", "neuter", masculine/ feminine"}: d5=0,d6=0 ?
masculine, d5=0, d6=1 ?
femine, d5=1,d6=0 ?
neutur, d5=1, d6=1  ?
mascu-line/feminine.General set model of inflection morphology wepresented (Yablonsky S., 1999) permits to definemostly all sides of inflection morphology forRussian, Ukrainian and other Slavic languages.4 Russian Lexical Databases for Mor-phologyThe morphological analyzer has two main parts:?
dictionary with declarative linguistic knowl-edge of the language;?
program realization of morphologic model'salgorithms.In general dictionary lexical information is rep-resented in such form:Vi = {Wi, fi},   i = 1?
Nv, (3)where Wi = (a1, a2, ?
, aLi) ?
lexical part of dic-tionary's article: the word or phrase, composedfrom the alphabet characters A = {aS : s = 1, ?
,Na}; tag part fi = (f1, f2, ?
, fk) ?
subset of tagsfrom the set F = { fr : r = 1, ?
, Nf}, Nv ?
num-ber of the words (word-tokens) in the dictionary,for large-scale dictionaries of inflective lan-guages usually Nv > 1500 000.There are three main variants of database reali-zation.4.1 Compressed Database4.1.1 WFS-dictionary DatabaseThe part of the word including prefix(es) androot is  called word formative stem (WFS).
Thepart of the word including prefix(es), root andsuffix(es) is called word inflective stem (WIS).In the compressed WFS - dictionary database allWIS are distributed into word forming groups(WFG).
Word forming group consists of such setof fours:<WFSi, SUF, FC, Ii> (1),where SUF ?
suffix (number of the suffix), FC ?inflection class number; WISi* = WFSi ?
SUF.Usually only first 255 maximum frequent suf-fixes are coded as separate linguistic units incompress WFS-dictionary realization.
Other suf-fixes are included in WFS.4.1.2 WIS-dictionary DatabaseFor increasing speed of morphological analysisall WIS with stem gradation are generated.
Inthe compressed WIS - dictionary database theordered sequence of all lexemes is stored.
Thespeed of analysis is increased in 10 times.Besides, several additional tables are used: tableof inflection classes, inflection class ?
inflec-tions, inflection ?
inflection classes, inflectionclass ?
right direct substitutions, joint right di-rect and right inverse substitutions, direct andinverse tables of suffixes, prefixes and substitu-tions in prefixes, and some other (see YablonskyS., 1999).4.2 Word-dictionary DatabaseToday the memory cost is dramatically goingdown.
So words without compression could bestored on HDD/RAM.
The simplified UML-notation of the database for storing such re-sources is shown below.4.2.1 Word-dictionary database UMLNotationToday Unified Modeling Language (UML) de-fines a standard notation for object-oriented sys-tems (Booch G., Rumbaugh J., and Jacobson I.,1998).
The objective of modeling is to completea rigorous design with quality checks before webuild a word-dictionary database system.
TheUML is an object-oriented methodology thatstandardizes modeling language and notation,not a particular method.
Using UML enhancescommunication between linguistic experts,workflow specialists, software designers andother professionals with different backgrounds.We introduced simplified UML data model (seefigure 1) for word-dictionary database and de-veloped a table-based UML mapping accordingto UML notations.There are two main tablesin database.
Relationaltable LEMMA is destined for storing lemma?slinguistic information and has such attributes:L_NUM ?
lemma?s index;L_NAME ?
lemma;FK_NUM ?
number of inflection class;L_PREF_LEN ?
length of prefixes;L_ROOT_LEN ?
length of root;L_SUF_LEN ?
length of suffixes;L_FLEX_LEN ?
length of inflection;L_TRANSCR ?
transcribtion;L_ACCENT ?
number of accent letter;L_BYTE ?
byte of additional linguisticinformation.Relational table PARADIGM is destined forstoring paradigm entry-word?s linguistic infor-mation and has attributes similar to LEMMAtable.Example of Russian entry word ?????
'dream'with its inflection paradigm plus grammaticaltags and hyphenation see below.Lemma: ?????.Paradigma:?????
noun, feminine, singular, nominative, inanimate?????????

The main advantage ofRDBMS is their maturity and almost three dec-ades of experience with them.In general the main features of Word-dictionarydatabase are implemented using commercialDBMS Oracle9i.
Usage of Unicode simplifiesMultilanguage Word-dictionary development.PL/SQL-script for database creation is availableby e-mail request root@russicon.spb.su.5 Derivational morphology and com-poundingDerivational morphology is based on detectionof fixed expressions (more then 2000 of Russianidioms, proverbs, sayings), multiword preposi-tions, prefixes/suffixes with strong derivationfunctions and productive central derived, com-pounds (3000 of most frequent Russian com-pounds), processing 198 features consisting ofmorphosyntactic features, derivational features,stylistic features and punctuator features.6 System for construction and supportof Russian Grammatical DictionariesSystem allows to receive morphological infor-mation of the word and to build normal form forthe word, shows paradigm for the word (see fig-ure 2), constructs new words lexicon, constructsfrequency lexicon.
It provides such morphologi-cal information for new words treatment:?
input of grammatical characteristics of newwords, length of word-building and word-changing stems, number of  inflexion classetc.;?
generation of different variants of inflexionparadigms for new word containing only onecorrect variant;?
input of inflection paradigm of new words.7 Russian Morphological AnalyzerMorphological analyzer and normalyzer allows:?
to define following grammatical characteris-tic s of a word: part of speech, case, gender,number, tense, person, degree of compari-son, voice, aspect, mood, form, type, transi-tiveness, reflexive, animation;?
to modify a given word to its normal gram-matical form/s ?
lemma/s (normalyzer).
Aset of applications were build on the base ofthe processor for three mentioned Slavoniclanguages.All applications are designed in Java and Oracle9i.
