TEXT DISAMBIGUATION BY FINITE STATE AUTOMATA,AN ALGORITHM AND EXPERIMENTS ON CORPORAEmmanuel Roche*Insitut Gaspard Monge CERII,-LADL**Paris France1.
Abstract*Consulting a dictionary for the words of agiven text provides multiple solutions, that is,ambiguities; thus, the sequence of words pilotstudies could lead for example to:pilot: N singular, V infinitive, V (conjugated)studies: N plural, V (conjugated)pilot studies: N plural (compound).These informations could be organized in theform of a finite automaton such as:pilot studies N plural| "'" (compound) |The exploration of the context should provideclues that eliminate the non-relevant solutions.For this purpose we use local grammarconstraints represented by finite automata.
Wehave designed and implemented an algorithmwhich performs this task by using a largevariety of linguistic onstraints.
Both the textsand the rules (or constraints) are represented inthe same formalism, that is finite automata.Performing subtraction operations betweentext automata nd constraint automata reducethe ambiguities.
Experiments were performedon French texts with large scale dictionaries(one dictionary of 600.000 simple inflectedforms and one dictionary of 150.000 inflectedcompounds).
Syntactic patterns represented byautomata, including shapes of compoundnouns such as Noun followed by an Adjective(in gender-number agreement) (Cf 5.
I), can bematched in texts.This process is thus an extension of the classicmatching procedures because of the on-linedictionary consultation and because of thegrammar constraints.
It provides a simple andefficient indexing tool.2.

Franceeroche@ladl.jussieu.fr Universit6 Paris 7Automatic analysis by phrase-structuregrammar is time COtlsuming.
The need for fastprocedures leads to grammar representationsthat are less powerful but easier to handle thangeneral unification procedures.
Pereira andWright 1991 and Rimon and Herz 1991proposed such approaches, that is, algorithmsthat perform the construction of a finite-stateautomaton approximation f a phrase-structuregrammar, These automata re then used assimple checkers of well-formed patterns.However, parsing a sentence and onlyproviding the information that it does (ordoesn't) match the automaton description isnot sufficient.
One should provide (see K.Koskenniemi 19901 the readings of the textthat respect exactly the constraints.We proposehere an algorithm that provide all thesereadings.
Moreover, the autonlatou of a giventext can be highly ambiguous, and in order toincrease its adequacy (e.g.
to study givensyntactic patterns), we may want to customizeit.
To achieve such a result, we constructautomata that eliminate paths irrelevant to thegiven study I.
Once this operation wasperformed, significant patterns (like NounAdjective in French) can be extracted,Technical terms in many domains take theform of sequences such as Noun Adjective,Noun de Noun etc.
Their recognition thusleads to an efficient indexation process.
This isa complementary approach to statisticaltreatments like those presented in K.Church,W.
Gale, P. Hanks, D. Hindle 1989 or in N.Calzolari and R. Binzi 1991.Moreover, we use Finite-State Automata(FSA) at all stages of the process: fordictionary consultation, for disambiguationand for the final extraction process.
Thisallowed the experiments to be done on-linestarting with untagged corpora.One of the crucial points is that tagged textshould be represented by FSA in order to bedisambiguated (disambiguated texts are alreadyin this form in Rimon and Herz 1991 and K.Koskenniemi 1990).
FSA representation forambiguities representation is not a newapproach but in our contribution, we1Sonic of these paths may correspond to legitimatesolutions.A(.q'ES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 hOtrV 1992 9 9 3 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992systematized it for different types ofambiguities, namely:1.
Morphological features ambiguity (genderfor instance),2.
Part of speech ambiguity,3.
Phrase ambiguity (compound v.s.
sequenceof simple words).3.
Presentation of an exampleLet us take, for instance, the French sequence(1).. le passe...Both words are ambiguous, lecan either be anarticle (the) or a pronoun (it, him or her) andpasse can either be a noun or a verb.
Moreoverthe noun passe is still ambiguous, ince it canmean either a pass key (and is then masculine)or a pass (like in a forward pass, it is thenfeminine).
The verb form passe, ill turn, isambiguous, it is a conjugated form of thecanonical form passer (to pass) in one of thethree tenses: indicative present, subjunctivepresent or imperative present.
For the first twotenses, it can either be in the first or in tile thirdsingular person and, for the latter, it has to bein the second person of singular.The problem is the following: the consultationof the simple form dictionary DELAF 2(600.000 entries) first provides a sequencetagged as follows:le (pronoun, article) passe(noun-ms, noun-fs,verb-P3s:S3s:Pls:Sls:Y2s)(where the abbreviations are m: masculine, s: singular,3: third person, P: present, S: subjunctive, Y:imperative)The compound form dictionary DELACF 3(150.000 entries) is used, it marks sequenceslike pomme de terre (potato) as frozen.
In asecond step, we provide the automatonrepresentation f figure 1, to be read in thefollowing way: The first word is either apronoun or an "article, its spelling is le, thesecond word is either a singular noun(ambiguous: one meaning is masculine (thepass key) and tile other feminine (the forwardpass)) or else a verb conjugated at thepersons, tenses and numbers pecified above.2DELAF: LADL's inflected forms dictionary for simplewords: B. Courmis 1984,1989.3DELACF: LADL's inflected forms dictionary forcompound words: M. Silbcrztein 1989.pronoun~ passe OFigure 1On the other hand grammar ules provideconstraints which can be described asforbidden sequences.
In our example, sincethe clitic sequence is highly constrained (M.Gross 1968), the pronoun le can be followedeither by another pronoun or by a verb.
Thearticle le cannot be followed by a verb or by afeminine noun (except for parts ofcompounds).
This set of forbidden sequencesis described by the automaton offigure 2.Figure 2.Thus the FSA representing the text accordingto the roles should be the FSA of figure 3.Figure 3.The problem consists in constructing theautomaton offigure 3 given those of figures 1The reader probably noticed that file rules weredescribed as a set of forbidden sequences,which is unusual.
The formal operation andthe algorithm are easier to describe withnegatively defined rules, it is the reason whywe use this device here.
However, given thegrammar corresponding to the automatonrepresentation, the procedure is equivalent to aset of rules expressed in a positive, and hencemore usual way.4.
The algorithm4.1 Formal description of the problem.The problem, informally described, can easilybe specified in the following way:ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt~T 1992 9 9 4 PROC.

1992Given a text, its FSA representation (e.g.figure 1) AI is defined by the 5-tuple(Alph,QL,il,Fl,dl) which respectively denotesits alphabet, its state set, its starting state, itsfinal state set and its transition function 4 whichmaps (Ql*Alph) into Q1.
Moreover, A1 hasthe property of being acyclic (it is a DirectedAcyclic Graph (DAG)).
The constraints arerepresented by the FSA A2, defined in thesame way by (Alph,Q2,i2,f2,d2).
Theseautomata define respectively the regularlanguages L I=L(A I )  (i.e.
the languageaccepted by A1) and L2=L(A2) (i.e.
thelanguage accepted by A2) ?
Since L2 describesthe set of sequences (or factors) forbidden inany word of L1, if A describes the text afterthe filtering, this means that L=L(A) followsthe condition L = L1 \Alph* L2 Alph*This operation on languages will be calledfactor subtraction and will be noted L=L1f- L2.
At this point, we can define the relatedoperation on automata: if L I=L(A1) andL2=L(A2)  we say that A is the factorsubtraction of A1 and A2 and note it A= A1 f-A2 if L=L1 f- A2 and L=L(A).4.2 In fo rmal  descr ip t ion  of thea lgor i thmWe will first apply the algorithm on a smallexample.
Suppose that A1 is the automatonrepresented in figure 4, that A2 is theautomaton represented in figure 5 and that wewant to compute AI f- A2.cFigure 4cFigure 5Each state of the automaton A=At f- A2 will belabelled with a state of A 1 and a set of states ofA2 (i.e a member of the power set of Q2).More concretely the automaton A=A 1 f- A2 offigure 6 is built in the following way:The initial state is labelled (0,{0}), the first 0refers to the state 0 of A1 (01 for short).
Theletter a leads, from 01 to the state 11 of AI butto nothing in A2, we construct the state4The automata re assumed to be detotministic, which isnot an additional constraint since one can determinizethem (see Aho, HoperopfL Huffman 1974 for instance).
(1,{0}) which means that, for a, 0 leads to 1in At but that {0} leads to nothing (the emptyset) in A2 to which we systematically add theinitial state.
On the other hand, d2({0},b)={ 1 }to which we add, as for a, the state 0; thus, inA, d((0,{O}),b) = (dl(O,b), {O,d2(0,b)})=(1,{0,1}).
For each state being constructed,we list file states it could refer to in A2 and, foreach of these states, their image by the letterbeing considered.
A specific configuration iswhen the state of A being considered has oneof his label that leads to the final state of A2, itmeans that a complete sequence of A2 has beenrecognized and should then be deleted.
This isthe case if we look at state (2,{0,1,2}) in A:d2({0,1,2},b)=\[1,2,3} where 3 is final, thusit has no m msition for b, which leads to deletethe path bbb forbidden by A2.Figure 6The following algorithm computes A1 f- A2l.f\[0l=(il,{i2/)2.q=0;3.n=l;4.F;~;5.do6.

Experimental resultsGiven a syntactic pattern (fL,'st Noun followedby an Adjective) and a text, we can detect itsoccurrences.
We can search the text withoutapplying constraints, this provides output 1(figures 7 and 8).We can also search it afterhaving applied constraints (output 2).
We shallcompare both outputs.
For instance, for thesentence:L'individu n'y est pas perfu comme une valeurabstraite t universelle, mais comme un ~tre concret,comme le membre d'un ensemble particulier, Iocalisdet qui n'eJdste que darts son rapport d cet ensemble.the program provides the following matchings:(t) (2)y est valeur abstraitevaleur abstraite 6tre concret~tre concret ensemble particulierdunensemble particulierFigure 7DELAF \] \[DELACF\[compound word Simple words \[dictionarydictionary570.000 entries \[ 150.000 entriesvI esen ti?n I- '--->iV I F a pr?

Itfirst takes a text and tags it according to thetwo dictionaries.
The text is then transformedinto its FSA representation on which theconstraints are applied.Given a pattern (Noun followed by anAdjective), we compare its number ofocuurences in both outputs 1 and 2.
This willgive us a measure of the power of the filtering.It is worthwhile to point out that theexperiments were realized on untaggedcorpora, namely that the duration of thetagging process is included in the figures givenin the tables.
These experiments were done onpersonal computers5 and it can be seen that the5Experiments were done with an IBM PS2 386 25Mhzwith an OS/2 V1.3 and 8Mb ram.
The program is in C.time spent is low enough to permit on-line use(for compound word enrichment for instance).5.1 Searching Noun-Adjective patternsFirst, let us consider the pattern NounAdjective (which is approximately equivalentto the English sequence adjective-noun).
Wefirst tried to search each contiguous pair ofwords whose first element was labelled as anoun and whose second element was anadjective.
This provides the result of the firstline of figure 9.
The first filtering uses the factthat, in French, the word and the adjectivehave to agree on their gender and on theirnumber.
This gives, for the same texts, theresults of the second line.
Third we applied thealgorithm described above as a second filter,this leads to the results of the third line.Editorial Article Novel Corpus4185 13010b.
