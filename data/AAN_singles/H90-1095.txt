We use a multi-stage decision-treeencoder with linear combinations of features at the decision odes; the result is segmentswhich cover multiple frames and which are coded with the terminal node number of thefinal tree.Additional contract objectives include showing that application knowledge can be efficientlyapplied to these codes to produce accurate transcriptions.
The Knowledge SystemsLaboratory at Stanford University is to help test he result in an application-developmentenvironment.
The contract isto produce results which can be employed ina commercialsystem at the end of the contract.SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTSWe showed that segmenting and coding speech using SSI's phonetic encodingsignificantly improves both speed and accuracy for a system using Markov modelling.We reduced utterance error ate by 25.7% with a further 40% increase in speed byreducing the number of ways words were spelled in the dictionary and by re-definingthe phonetic lasses.The word error in decoding of phonetic odes into words was further decreased by atypical 20% using a penalty that reduced the erroneous insertion of smail words.Speed of recognition was further increased by a factor of two by using a more efficientstructure in the decoding software.Software was modified to provide access to transcriptions other than the best guess(e.g., the second through tenth best guesses) to aid the user in making corrections.Software was also modified to give application developers access to semantic knowledgeinherent in the structure of the language model used in the recognition process; forexample, various names that a radiologist called a tumor seen in an xray (mass, density,tumor, etc.)
would all be labeUed "tumor.
"PLANSLarger segments and other variations will be tested in a Markov model environment.Contract improvements in SSI's Phonetic Engine will be integrated, tested as a whole, andperformance r ported on RM data.423
