Usually the sense of this relation is expressedas a label, often within a hierarchy of sense labels.
But the meaning of theselabels may vary from system to system, and the same connective may be as-signed different labels in different systems.
Given this, we might learn moreand make better predictions if (i) sense labels were associated with (someof) their entailments and (ii) connectives were characterized in terms of boththeir formal properties and their use conditions.
I?ll give examples of both.The above-mentioned predictions tie in with an interesting property ofPenn Discourse TreeBank annotation.
Annotators were allowed to assignmultiple sense labels to a single connective, to imply that all the senses heldsimultaneously.
For those cases where adjacent sentences lacked an inter-vening connective, annotators were instructed to try to insert one or moreconnectives that (together) expressed the relation(s) between the sentences.Here too, in many cases, annotators inserted a single connective to whichthey assigned multiple meanings, Other times they inserted multiple connec-tives to convey the relation(s) they took as being expressed.
Some of thiswill be shown to make more sense in terms of the entailments and formalproperties of the connectives than in terms of any sense labels.I?ll close by trying to distinguish discourse connectives that are associatedwith coordinating or subordinating relations between sentences or clauses,which is an feature of discourse structure, from those connectives that simplyconvey additional relevant semantic or pragmatic content.1
