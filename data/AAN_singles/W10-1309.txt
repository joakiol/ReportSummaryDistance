Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2010 Workshop on Speech and Language Processing for Assistive Technologies, page 71,Los Angeles, California, June 2010. c?2010 Association for Computational LinguisticsWorkshop on Speech and Language Processing for Assistive TechnologiesDemo Session1 ?How was School today...??
A PrototypeSystem that Uses Environmental Sensorsand NLG to Support Personal Narrativefor Children with ComplexCommunication NeedsRolf Black, Joseph Reddington, Ehud Reiter, NavaTintarev and Annalu WallerWe will show an in-situ sensor based proto-type that supports personal narrative for childrenwith complex communication needs.
We willdemonstrate the process from data collection, storygeneration and editing, to the interactive narrationof stories about a child?s school day.
The challeng-ing environment of a special school for prototypetesting will be discussed and improvements of thenext generation prototype presented.2 Interactive SIGHT Demo: TextualSummaries of Simple Bar ChartsSeniz Demir, David Oliver, Edward Schwartz,Stephanie Elzer, Sandra Carberry and Kathleen F.McCoyInteractive SIGHT is intended to provide peo-ple with visual impairments access to the kindof information graphics found in popular media.It works as a browser extension, and is able togenerate a summary of a simple bar chart containingits high-level intention as natural language text.The user may request further information about thegraphic through a follow-up question facility.3 Project Jumbo: Transcription as anAssistive Technology for InstantMessagingIra R. Forman and Allen K. WilsonThe integration of VoIP into Instant Messagingmay be a boon for most of us, but not for thosewho are deaf and hard of hearing.
The IBM HumanAbility & Accessibility Center initiated ProjectJumbo to address this problem.
Our remedy is toadd a speech-to-text capability to augment voiceservices with transcripts.
In particular, ProjectJumbo augments IBM Lotus Sametime.
ProjectJumbo, which is transitioning to product statusunder name IBM AbilityLab Sametime ConferenceTranscriber, will be demonstrated.
The democonsists of a chat between the demonstrator and aremote colleague in which the demonstrator speaksrather than types.
A major point of the demo isthat interactive communication is a new domainfor ASR.
This domain differs from dictation in anumber of ways; prominent among them is thatmost speech recognition errors do not need to becorrected.4 COMUNICA - A Voice QuestionAnswering System for PortugueseRodrigo Wilkens, Aline Villavicencio, LeandroWives, Daniel Muller, Fabio da Silva and StanleyLohThis is a voice QA system for Brazilian Por-tuguese that performs speech recognition, textprocessing, database access and speech synthesisfor consulting both structured and unstructureddatasets.
This system provides multi-modal com-munication and has the potential to help users withdisabilities to access relevant information, and mayhelp to significantly increase digital inclusion.71
