Thesetools are developed within the frame ofcategory theory.i.
The challan~e of formalha ndlin@ of semanticsFor long times, natural languagehas been regarded as some very soft,amorphous, and whimsical  phenomenon.Although theoretical considerationsshowed that this may not be so, the veryfact that actual l inguistic methodologywas quite soft and intuitive seemed toconfirm the conviction that languagecannot be treated very rigorously.
Itis clear, however, that the more ex-plicit and transparent framework we usefor handl ing a very complex phenomenon,the more can learn about what its com-plexity really consists of.
It has beenthe use of more or less mathematical--minded methods improving the situationin recent decades.A very important first step in thedirection of establ ishing such a frame-work has been generative grammar.
USingthe theory of formal languages it gavea fairly abstract picture of what syntax{s, and it has also proved to be anextremely powerful tool in analysingadmittedly very subtle syntactic phe-nomena and, what is even more, in dis-covering formerly unnoticed intercon-nections.Whatever revealing the results ofgenerative grammar should be with res-pect to syntax, however, it cannot beregarded as paradigmatic if one is in-terested in a semantics-oriented modelof language.
Generative grammariansnever put the question of what semanticsis and what role it plays in language at thesame theoretical level they reachedwith syntax.It is reasonable to require thatany treatment of semantics be adequateto rigorously formalized methods usedfor syntax.
For this we should useformalism not as abbreviation but asbasic tool of investigation, e.g.
re-lating exact mathematical  objects tocomponents of language.
Moreover weaim to characterize language throughanalysing the corresponding mathemati-cal methods.
An appropriate approachcan be borrowed from mathematical logic.This results the so called model theore~csemantics (MTS).
MTS is an attitude toinvestigate natural language from thepoint of view of semantics.
This atti-tude provides the investigation ofnatural language on an abstract level.Namely, it answers the question in themost abstract sense what language isand what its basic components are.
Thebasic properties of the MTS's attitudeare analysed in \[31.2.
What is MTS?Language can be analysed onlythrough analysing language carriers.From the different possible functions,the language possesses, we find thecognitive one the most signif icant andthis answers our question above.
Consid-ering a language carrying system/whether it be human or a machine orelse/ the cognitive function is real-ized while the language is used to de-scribe objects and events of the envi-ronment under cognition.
Characteris inglanguage we abstract from the cognitiveprocess itself and from the internal213organ izat ion  of the system.
Our mereconcern is the outcome of the cogni t iveprocess, that is, descr ipt ive texts andtheir  re lat ion to the env i ronment  whichthey refer  to.
MTS att i tude demands anideal external  observer  (EO) who is tomodel the system (S) and the system'senv i ronment  wor ld  (W).
EO forms modelsof S, of W and of the S-W relat ion.In order that EO should be able toform the intended models,  he must pos-sess the fo l lowing kinds of knowledgeabout the sample s i tuat ion (and EO beingan ideal observer,  we assume he real lydoes):(i) EO knows the aspect and thelevel at which S may perceiveand descr ibe the environment;in other words, EO knows S'ssensit iv i ty.
(ii) EO knows those fundamental  as-pects of W that S maydescribe.
(i)-(i i) together  ensure that EOmodels W adequate ly  wi th  respect  to S.( i i i )EO knows that S is f initewhereas W is both inf in i teand inf in i te ly  complex.
(iv) EO knows that S's actual  en-v i ronment  is accidental .
Theknowledge S may obta in  ateach stage of its cogni t ion iscompat ib le  wi th  inf in i te ly  manyposs ib le  worlds.
The S-W re-lat ion is therefore uncerta in:the texts of S always corre-spond to in f in i te ly  many envi-ronments,  rather than a uniqueone.On the bas is  of (i)-(iv) EO formsthe fo l lowing models:  The model of S wi l ljust be a system product ing  texts (moreprecisely,  the mater ia l  bodies of texts,whatever  they should be).
In case EOhappens to be a mathemat ic ian ,Mode l  (S)wi l l  be a formal grammar capable of gen-erat ing the texts of the language.The model of  W is a meta l ingu is t i cdescr ipt ion  of the world, adequate to S's sensit iv i ty.
For purely theoret ica lpurposes,  EO only has to take into ac-count that S has some f ixed thougharbi t rary sensit iv i ty,  determin ing theposs ib le  character  of the objects andphenomena of W S may descr ibe.
Whenmodel l ing  some concrete language, S'ssens i t iv i ty  is also f ixed though nolonger arb i t rary ly  .
In case EO happensto be a mathemat ic ian,  Model  (W) wi l l  bea mathemat ica l  object.
Because of theuncerta inty  of the S-W re lat ion,Model (W)is a class of models  of inf in i te ly  manyposs ib le  worlds.The model of the S-W relation is somecor respondance between e lements of textsand things in the wor ld-models .
In caseEO happens to be a mathemat ic ian,Model(S-W) can be a class of re lat ionsor funct ions.We have reached the point where wemay def ine language as it appears atthis level of abstract ion.
By an abstraotlanguage La we mean a triple <Model (S),Model  (W~, Model  (S-W)>.
Furthermore,we cal l  Model  (S) the syntax of LA,and Model  (W) and Model  (S-W) togetherthe semantics of L A.
We emphasize thatall these models are formed by an idealexternal  observer  and are descr ibed inhis own language.The aboves i l lust rated by thefo l lowing figure.~ystem S ~i~etn~i t !_ -.

The set F t of all poss ib leformulas generated from the a lphabetwith logical  connect ives in the usualway corresponds to Model(S) .

The so ca l led val id i ty  rela-t ion h% t x toModel  Thu~ a t-type c lass icalf irst order language L t is the tr iple<Ft,Mt,l=>.3.
MTS in more complex s i tuat ionsA very simple, we may say, an ide-a l ized s i tuat ion has been cons ideredabove.
Namely wi th  respect  to S itwas supposed that its cogni t ion goes onat a f ixed level and aspect of analysis,i.e.
with a f ixed sensit iv i ty.
We callthis type of cogni t ion homogeneouscognit ion.214However  MTS att i tude enables us tocharacter ize  natura l  language not onlyin the above s impl ic i ty  but in thecomplex i ty  that approx imates  morerea l i s t ic  cases.Indeed a system S can desr ibethe same objects and events of W fromd i f ferent  aspects and at d i f ferent  lev-els cf detai l ing.
Moreover  beyond thegreat spect rum of sens i t iv i ty  d i f ferentenv i ronment  wor lds can be the object  ofcognit ion.
Cogni t ion  in this s i tuat ionis said to be heterogeneous cognit ion.The s i tuat ion  to be descr ibed f rom thepoint of v iew of EO is as fol lows.System s sensitivity~ 1\[sensitivityi IThe natura l  language i tse l f  vir-tual ly seems to enable us to speak aboutvery d i f ferent  k inds of env i ronment  atvery d i f ferent  levels from very d i f fer -ent aspects.Thus in this l ight natura l  lan-guage appears as an extremely  r ich many--purpose language.Beyond the surface natural  lan-guage consits  of such parts which them-selves are languages as wel l  (cf.
w i ththe subdev is ion  of natura l  languageinto a set of d ia lects  or socio lects) .These parts, the sublanguages,  areh is tor ica l ly  formed from others.
Withthe growth of the observable  env i ronmentthe cor respond ing  knowledge also widens.The latter needs new language e lementsso as to be descr ibed.
Therefore somewords change their  meanings,  new con-cepts appear which emerge into newsublanguages.E.g.
the word "tree" has quite ad i f ferent  meaning for a woodman, for ab io logist ,  for a painter,  for a child,for a l inguist,  for a mathemat ic ian,etc.
The d i f ferent  meanings are con~nected with  d i f ferent  sub languages whichare but  d i f ferent  soc io lects  in thiscase.However  the sublanguages are notindependen t .
They are in a very complexconnect ion,  e.g.
one may extract  lexicalmorpho log ica l  or other  k inds of connec-t ions on the base of wh ich  one or otherh ierarchy of sublanguages can be sortedout.
Such a h ierarchy provides aposs ib le  "select ion" for the natura llanguage.
Thus a hierarchy of languagesconsists  of the const i tuent  languagestogether  wi th  the re lat ion cons ideredbetween them.Note that one can f ind a deta i ledsurvey of d i f ferent  approaches to sub-languages in \[6\], where another  ap-proach has ar isen to analyse sublan-guages which are ca l led there subsystemsof languages.How natura l  language as a manypurpose one can be invest igated wi thMTS att i tude.F i rst  of all a so ca l led disjunctiveapproach can be appl ied for, accord ingto which EO subdiv ides the language intosuch parts each of wh ich  can be model ledas a homogeneous one, i.e.
as a languagethat corresponds to a unique and f ixedsensi t iv i ty .Now it is supposed that S hasseveral  languages rather  than a singleone.
So Model  (S} should consist  of aconglomerate  of sublanguages.
Howeverif the sublanguages were independentthen EO could model  S as a conglomerateof subsystems.
But this is not the casebecause among most  of the sublanguagesthere are some t rans i t ion  poss ib i l i t iese.g.
t ranslat ion,  interpretat ion.The MTS att i tude possesses  tools(developed w i th in  the frame of mathe-mat ica l  logic) by the use of which thehomogeneous cases can be descr ibed.
Soa conglomerate  of languages can also bedescr ibed by these tools but only as aconglomerate  of independent languages.What  about the connect ion between twolanguages?
Mathemat ica l  logic prov idestools only for the case when the lan-guages have the same s ignature,  i.e.when their  a lphabet  is the same.
Inthis case the not ion of homomorph ism ispower fu l  enough to descr ibe the connec-t ion between the languages.
But such acase is of not much interest  to lin-guists.Perhaps it is more interest ing toanalyse the connect ion  between languagesof d i f ferent  type (e.g.
between a tl-- type and t~-type f irst  order c lass ica llanguagesl .Let us see e.g.
t ranslat ion.Having two d i f ferent  languages say,Engl ish  and Russlan, t rans lat ing  a textfrom one into the other  f irst of all werequire not a d i rect  cor respondence215between the words, but a connect ionbetween the cor respond ing  "world concep-t ions" of the languages and only then isit resonable  to estab l i sh  the connect ionbetween the syntact ica l  e lements.
In MTSthis means that for the t rans la t ion  wehave toi) represent  the "world concep-tion" of the languages inquest ion.
A "world concept ion"is but a set of sentences(knowledge) that determines  asubclass of Model(W);ii) es tab l i sh  the connect ion  be-tween the cor respond ing  sub-c lasses of models,  i.e.
be-tween the "world concept ions" ;iii) es tab l i sh  the connect ion  amongthe cor respond ing  syntact ica le lements.But up to now MTS has not been in pos-sess ion of tools to sat is fy  the aboverequ i rements  ( i)-( i i i ) .Note that in mathemat ica l  logic aset of sentences determines  a theory.
Atheory T determines  a subclass Mod (T)of models,  namely those models  whereeach sentence of T is val id.
(Thus atheory T induces a new language<Ft,Mod(T)  , I = >.)
Thus f i rst  of all aconnect ion  between the cor respond ingtheor ies is requ i red for the translat ion.However  t rans la t ion  between any twolanguages may not always exist.
E.g.
letus have two languages phys ics  and bio l -ogy and we want  to estab l i sh  connect ionbetween them.
For this we should analysethe connect ion  between the cor respond ingknowledges .However  this analysis,  asusual, cannot  be es tab l i shed  direct ly.A med iator  theory is needed.
The media-tor is an in terd i sc ip l inary  theory, e.g.the language of general  system theory(see e.g.
\[2\]).
By the use of the media-tor a new language with a new k ind ofknowledge ar izes from the input lan-guages, namely b iophys ics .Our aim is the extens ion  of the MTSatt i tude to analyse the semant ics  ofmany-purpose  languages and languageh ierarchies .
We deve lop such tools (wlth-in the frame of mathemat ica l  logic) bythe use  of which  EO can model  a languagecarry ing system not only in a homogene-ous s i tuat ion,  but in a heterogeneousone too, the complex i ty  of which  approx-imates the real cases.Here we only out l ine the basic  ideaprov id ing  the basic  not ions,  s ince thebounds of this paper  do not a l low us togive a deta i led  descr ip t ion  of the toolsThis can be found in \[i\].A l though the f irst order  c lass ica llanguages do not seem to be adequate forl inguist ics ,  it st i l l  prov ides basis  forany MTS research.
Therefore  we introducethe necessary  tools of the analys is  ofthe h ierarch ies  of c lass ica l  f i rst orderlanguages.
These tools can be extendedfor the analys is  of d i f fe rent  kinds oflanguages mak ing  use of the exper ienceprov ided  by the analys is  of the c lass i -cal case.4.
Basic not ionsDefinition I.
(similarity type)A s imi lar i ty  type t is a pair  t=<H,t '>such that "t' is a function, t' : Dom t '~Nwhere N is the set of natura l  numbersand O~N, and H ~_ Dom (t').Let <r,n>Et'  (i.e.
let t'(r) = n).
Ifr6H then r is said to be an n-1 -aryfunction symbol, if r~H then r issaid to be an n-ary relation symbol .
?Let ~ be an ordinal .

?Thus in the case of a given theoryT C_ contains all the formulas which arecompat ib le  wi th T. Moreover  C deter-mines what  can be descr ibed aT all aboutthe models  by the use of theory T. Notethat to CT a Boole a lgebra can be corre-sponded where O and 1 cor respond to"false" and "true" respect ive ly  and theoperators  cor respond to the logical  con-nect ives.
Let us cons ider  the fo l lowing216ExampleLet t = <~,{<R, i>}> be the s imular i tytype and T = <0,F\[> be a theory.
(Notethat this theory is axiomless.)
We wr i tex instead of Xo, Rx instead of R(x)and ~ instead of 9 / ~ .
The concepta lgebra C T looks as fol Iows~ ~ x R xVxRx0where we use the fo l lowing notat ions:c=HxRxAHx~Rx , d=VxRxVVx~Rx ,e=Rx-VxRx , f=~Rx~VxnRx ,g=RxAHx~Rx , h=nRxA~xRx ,i=9xRx~(RxAHx~Rx) ,  j=\ ]x~Rx-(~RxAgxRx) .The vertexes marker  by ~are  the fix-points of the operat ion  ~Xo.The formulas of the above C= tell  allT that can be said about the t - type mod-els in the c lass ica l  f i rst  order  lan-guage of a s ignature  of a s ingle unaryre lat ion symbol  when the theory isatomless.
?Now we def ine how a theory can beinterpreted by an other one.Definition 4.
(interpretation)Let T = <Ax~,F~ > and T0=<Axa,F  k >be theor ies in ~ var iables.
Let =m:F. e ~F~ .The=\ [ r i~e  <T~,m,T~> is said to be aninterpretation going f rom T~ into Ta(or an in terpretat ion  of T~ in T~)iff the fo l lowing condi t ions hold:a/ m(x .=x.

for every i,j<a;b/ m(~) -~m(~)~m(~) ,  m(~)=~m(~) ,m( \ ]x .9)=gx.m(~)  for all 9,%~F~ ,i<a;c/ Axe~(~)  far all ~6F~ such t~tAx~9.We shall  often say that m is anin terpretat ion  but in these cases weactual ly  mean <T~,m,T2>.
?Let m,n be two interpretat ions  ofTI in Ta.The in terpretat ions  <TI ,m,T2>,<T1,n ,Ta> are def ined to be semanticallyequivalent, in symbols m~n, iff thefo l lowing condi t ion holds:I= \[m(~)*-~n(~)\] for all ~F~ AxaLet <TI ,m,T~> be an interpretat ion.We def ine the equ iva lence class m~ of m(or mo~e prec ise ly  <TI ,m,T2>/~) to be:m/~ = {<TI,n,T2> : nmm}.Now we are ready to def ine the connect ionbetween two theor ies TI and T2.Definition 5.
(theory morphism)By a theory morphism u:T1-T2 going from T~into T2 we understand an equiva lenceclass of in terpretat ions  of TI in Ta,i .e.is a theory morph ism ~:TI~T2 iff v==m/~ for some in terpretat ion  <T I ,m,T2>.

Then there is at most  one theorymorph ism which  sat is f ies  p. ?Category  theory  provides the ade-quate mathemat ica l  frame wi th in  whichtheor ies and theory morphisms can beconsidered.
From now on we use the basicnot ions of category theory in the usualsense (see e.g.

The main property  of TH aThe heterogeneuous  s i tuat ion ,wherethe language carrying system uses notonly one language to descr ibe the envi-ronment  wor ld  can be descr ibed by EO asthe category TH ~.
Note that TH ~ containsall poss ib le  h ierarchies ,  because theconnect ion between any two const i tuentsis but an e lement of MorTH a.
The mathe-mat ica l  object  TH a provides the usageof the apparatus of category theory toanalyse the propert ies  of languagehierarchies.
Moreover  this frame al lowsus to estab l i sh  connect ion between anytwo theories even if there is not anyk ind of d i rect  re lat ion between them.In the latter case a "resultant" theoryshould be constructed which has d i rectconnect ion with or ig ina l  ones and thepower of express ion  of which joins thatof the or ig ina l  ones.
This "resultant"theory mediates  between the or ig ina ld i rect ly  unconnected theories.Note that the const ruct ion  of aresu l tant  theory to some given uncon-nected theor ies is one of .the most  impor-tant tasks of the General  System Theory(see e.g.
\[2\]).The fo l lowing theorem claims thecompleteness of IH a (in the sense of\[4\] or \[5\]).
This not ion corresponds(in category theory) to the above ex-pected property.Theorem 3.

(ii) There is an ef fect ive  procedure toconstruct  the l imits and col imitsof the e f fect ive ly  g iven d iagramsin TH ~ .

?Proof of B:The proof is based on the fact thatTh(Ax21=Th(Ax1@{Xo+X1=Xo*-~Xo+Xl=Xl}).
