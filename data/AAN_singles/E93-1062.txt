The PANGLOSS MARK I MAT systemRobert Frederking, Ariel Cohen, Dean Grannes, Peter Cousseau and Sergei NirenburgCenter for Machine TranslationCarnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh, PA 15213 USAThe goal of the PANGLOSS projecd is to develop a sys-tem which will, from the very beginning, produce high-quality translations ofunconstrained text.
This can onlybe attained currently by keeping the human in the trans-lation loop, in our case via a software module called theAUO~R.
The main measure of progress in the de-velopment of the Pangloss ystem will therefore be thegradual decrease in need for user assistance, as the levelof automation i creases.The analyzer used in the first version of PANGLOSS, PAN-GLOSS MARK I, is a version of the ULTRA Spanish analyzerfrom NMSU \[Farwell 1990\], while generation is carriedout by the PENMAN generator f om ISI \[Mann 1983\].
TheTranslator's Workstation (TWS) provides the user inter-face and the integration platform \[Nirenburg 1992\].
Thispaper focuses on this use of TWS as a substrate for PAN-GLOSS.PANOLOSS operates in the following mode: a) a fully-automated translation of each full sentence is attempted;if it fails, then b) a fully-automated translation of smallerchunks of text is attempted (in the first PANGLOSS con-figuration, PANGLOSS MARK I, these were noun phrases);c) the material that does not get covered by noun phrasesis treated in "word-for-word" mode, whereby translationsuggestions for each word (or phrase) are sought in thesystem's MT lexicons, amachine-readable dictionary, anda set of user glossaries; d) The resulting list of trans-lated noun phrases and translation suggestions for wordsand phrases is displayed in a special editor window ofTWS, where the human user finalizes the translation.
Atstages a) and b) there is an option of the user being pre-sented by the system with disambiguation questions viathe AUGMENTOR.
We provide an intelligent environment,the CMAT (Constituent Machine-Aided Translation) edi-tor, for postediting.
It allows the user to select, move,and delete words and phrases (constituents) quickly andeasily, using dynamically-changing menus.As can be seen in Figure 1, each constituent in the targetwindow is surrounded by "<<" and ">>" characters.
If theuser clicks with the mouse anywhere within a constituent(between the "<<" and ">>" symbols), a CMAT menu forthat constituent appears.
It contains the word or phrasein the source text if available, the functions Move andDelete, and alternative translations of the word or phrasefrom the source text if any.
Using these popup menus, theuser moves, replaces, or deletes a constituent with a singlemouse action, rapidly turning the list of translated words1PANOLOSS is a joint project of the Center for MachineTranslation at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), the Corn-puling Research Laboratory of New Mexico State University(NMSU), and the Information Sciences Institute of the Univer-sity of Southern California (IS1).III IIIII I .

The user is not forced to use the CMAT editor at anyparticular time.
Its use can be intermingled with othertranslation activities, according to the user's preferences.While the above environment is useful as a substratafor a gradual shift to ever more automatic systems, it isalso useful as a practical translator's tool.
Many minorimprovements of the tool itself are planned that shouldtogether result in a significant increase in the human trans-lator's comfort and efficiency.ReferencesFarwell, D., Y. Wilks, 1990.
