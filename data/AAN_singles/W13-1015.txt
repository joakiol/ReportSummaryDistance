Indeed,the feature that mostly characterises MWEs is theirfixedness at some level of linguistic analysis, be itmorphology, syntax, or semantics.
The morphologi-cal aspect is not trivial in languages which exhibit arich morphology, such as Romance languages.The issue is relevant in at least three aspects ofMWE representation and processing: lexicons, iden-tification, and extraction (Calzolari et al 2002).
Atthe lexicon level, MWEs are usual stored as oneform only, the so-called quotation form (or citationform).
However, some variations of the quotationform might also be valid instances of MWEs (Bondet al 2005) ?
some but not all, as some of themmight actually be plain compositional phrases.This becomes relevant for automatic identificationand extraction.
If a lexicon stores the quotation formonly, identification on a corpus done via matchinglexicon strings as such would miss valid variationsof a given MWE.
Identification could be done ex-ploiting lemmas rather than quotation forms, but anunrestricted match would also possibly return com-positional phrases.
Extraction is usually done ap-plying association measures over instances of givenPOS patterns (Evert and Krenn, 2005), and becauselemmas are matched, no restrictions on internal vari-ation is enforced as such.
Knowing which variationsshould be allowed for the quotation form of a givenMWE would help in increasing recall while keepingprecision high.
However, specifying such variationsfor each MWE would be too costly and wouldn?thelp in extraction, as no specifications could be donea priori on yet unknown MWEs.
Optimally, onewould need to find more general variation patternsthat could be applied to classes of MWEs.
Indeed,the main idea behind this work is that MWEs canbe handled through more general patterns.
This isalso claimed, for instance, by Masini (2007) whoseanalysis on Italian MWEs takes a constructionistperspective (Goldberg, 2003), by Weller and Heid(2010), who treat verbal expressions in German, andalso by Gre?goire (2010), who bases his work on theEquivalence Class Method (ECM, (Odijk, 2004)) as-suming that MWEs may be clustered according totheir syntactic pattern and treated homogeneously.We suggest that variation patterns can be found anddefined over POS sequences.
Working on Italian, inthis paper we report the results of ongoing researchand show how such patterns can be derived, we thenpropose a way to encode them in a repository, whichcan be combined with existing lexicons of MWEs.For the moment, we restrict our study to contiguousMWEs although we are aware that non-contiguousexpressions are common and should be treated, too(see also (Pianta and Bentivogli, 2004)).
Thus, onlymorphological variation is considered at this stage,while phenomena such as insertion and word ordervariation are left for future work.2 Obtaining Variation PatternsVariation patterns refer to POS sequences and relyon frequencies.
The main resources needed for ob-taining them are a MWE lexicon and a reference cor-pus (pos-tagged and lemmatised).We use a MWElexicon derived from an existing online dictionary101for Italian (Zaninello and Nissim, 2010), and thecorpus ?La Repubblica?
(Baroni et al 2004) for ob-taining frequencies.A variation pattern encodes the way a given in-stance of a MWE morphologically differs from itsoriginal quotation form in each of its parts.
Alltokens that correspond to the quotation form aremarked as fix whereas all tokens that do not aremarked as flex.
Consider Example (1):(1) a. quotation form: ?casa di cura?
(nursinghome)b. instance: ?case di cura?
(nursing homes)c. variation pattern: flex fix fixThe pattern for the instance in (1b) is flex fix fixbecause the first token, ?case?
(houses) is a plu-ral whereas the quotation form features a singu-lar (?casa?, house), thus is assigned a flex label,whereas the other two tokens are found exactly asthey appear in the quotation form, and are thereforelabelled as fix.At this point, it is quite important to note that abinary feature applied to each token makes flexibil-ity underspecified in at least two ways.
First, thevalue flex does not account by itself for the degreeof variation: a token is flex if it can be found in onevariation as well as many.
We have addressed this is-sue elsewhere via a dedicated measure (Nissim andZaninello, 2011), but we do not pick it up here again.In any case, the degree of variation could indeed beincluded as additional information.
Second, we onlyspecify which part of the MWEs varies but do notmake assumptions on the type of variation encoun-tered (for example, it doesn?t distinguish at the levelof gender or number).We believe this is a fair tradeoff which cap-tures generalisations at a level which is intermedi-ate between a word-by-word analysis and consider-ing the entire MWE as a single unit.
Additionally, itdoes not require finer-grained annotation than POS-tagging and lemmatisation, and allows for the dis-covery of possibly unknown and unpredicted varia-tions.
Morphological analysis, when needed, is ofcourse still possible a posteriori on the instancesfound, but it is useful that at this stage flexibility isleft underspecified.As said, validating variation patterns per MWEwould be impractical and uninformative with respectto the extraction of previously unseen MWEs.
Thus,we define variation patterns over part-of-speech se-quences.
More specifically, we operate as follows:1. search all MWEs contained in a given lexiconon a large corpus, matching all possible varia-tions (lemma-based, or unconstrained, search);2. obtain variation patterns for all MWEs by com-paring each instance to its quotation form;3. group all MWEs with the same POS sequence;4. for each POS sequence collect all variation pat-terns of all pertinent MWEs.In previous work (Nissim and Zaninello, 2013), wehave observed that frequency is a good indicatorof valid patterns: the most frequent variation pat-terns correlate with variations annotated as correctby manual judges.
Patterns for two nominal POSwere evaluated, and they were found to be success-ful.
In this paper we pick three further POS se-quences per expression type for a total of nine POSpatterns, and evaluate the precision of a pattern se-lection measure.The availability of variation patterns per POS se-quences (and expression type) can be of use both inidentification as well as in extraction.
In identifica-tion, patterns can be used as a selection strategy forall of the matched instances.
One could just use fre-quency directly from the corpus where the identifi-cation is done, but this might not always be possibledue to corpus size.
This is why using an externalrepository of patterns evaluated against a large ref-erence corpus for a given language might be useful.In extraction tasks, patterns can be used as fil-ters, either as a post-processing phase after match-ing lemmas for given POS sequences, or directlyextracting only allowed configurations which couldbe specified for instance in extraction tools such asmwetoolkit (Ramisch et al 2010).
In previouswork we have shown that patterns can be derivedcomparing found instances against their lemmatisedform, making this a realistic setting even in extrac-tion where quotation forms are not known (Nissimand Zaninello, 2013).1023 RankingFor ranking variation patterns we take into accountthe following figures:?
the total number of different variation patternsper POS sequence?
the total number of instances (hits on the cor-pus) with a given variation patternFor example, the POS sequence ADJ PRE NOUNcharacterising some adjectival expressions is fea-tured by 9 different original multiword expres-sions that were found in the corpus.
The vari-ations with respect to the quotation form (indi-cated as fix fix fix and found for seven differ-ent types) in which instances have been found arefour: flex fix fix (13 times), flex fix flex (7times), fix fix flex (3 times), and fix flex flex(one time), for a total of 31 variations.
Each in-stance yielding a given pattern was found at leastonce in the corpus, but possibly more times.
We takeinto account this value as well, thus counting thenumber of single instances of a given pattern.
So,while ?degni di nota?
(?worthpl mentioning?, quota-tion form: ?degno di nota?, ?worthsg mentioning?
)would serve as one variation of type flex fix fix,counting instances would account for the fact thatthis expression was found in the corpus 38 times.For the ADJ PRE NOUN sequence, instances ofpattern fix fix fix were found 130 times, in-stances of flex fix fix 219, flex fix flex 326,fix fix flex 90, and fix flex flex just once, fora total of 766 instances.Such figures are the basis for pattern ranking andare used in the repository to contribute to the de-scription of variation patterns (Figure 1).
We use theshare of a given variation pattern (vp) over the totalnumber of variations (pattern share).
In the exam-ple above, the share of flex fix fix (occurring 13times) would be 13/31 (41.9%), as 31 is the totalof encountered variations for the ADJ PRE NOUNPOS sequence.
We also use the instance share,which for the same variation pattern would be219/766 (12.0%) and combine it with the patternshare to obtain an overall share (sharevp):sharevp = (#variationsvp#variationspos+ #instancesvp#instancespos )/2As a global ranking score (GRSvp), the resulting av-erage share is combined with the spread, namelythe ratio of instances over variations (219/13 forflex fix fix), a pattern-internal measure indicat-ing the average instances per variation pattern.spreadvp =#instancesvp#variationsvpGRSvp = sharevp ?
spreadvpOnly patterns with GRS > 1 are kept, with the aimof maximising precision.
Evaluation is done againstsome POS sequences for which extracted instanceshave been manually annotated.
Precision, recall, andf-score are reported in Table 1.
Results for an un-constrained search (no pattern selection) are also in-cluded for comparison.
The number of variation pat-terns that we keep on the basis of the ranking scoreincludes the fix fix fix pattern.From the table, we can see that in most casesprecision is increased over an unconstrained match.However, while for verbal expressions the boostin precision preserves recall high, thus yielding f-scores that are always higher than for an uncon-strained search, the same isn?t true for adjectivesand adverbs.
In two cases, both featuring the samePOS sequence (PRE NOUN ADJ) though for dif-ferent expression types, recall is heavily sacrificed.In three cases, the GRS doesn?t let discard any pat-terns, thus being of no use in boosting precision.These are cases where only two variation patternswere observed, indicating that possibly other rank-ing measures could be explored for better results un-der such conditions.
In previous work we have seenthat selecting variation patterns works well for nom-inal expressions (Nissim and Zaninello, 2013).Overall, even though in some cases our methoddoes not yield different results than an unconstrainedsearch, whenever it does, precision is always higher.It is therefore worth applying whenever boostingprecision is desirable.4 Repository and EncodingWe create an XML-based repository of POS patternswith their respective variation patterns.
Variationpatterns per POS sequence are reported accordingto the ranking produced by the GRS.

Forthe element pattern, which specifies the POS se-quence, the attribute mwes indicates how many dif-ferent original mews were found for that sequence,and the attributes variations and instancesthe number of variations and instances (Section 3).Actual patterns are listed as data of a vp (variationpattern) element, according to decreasing GRS, withvalues obtained from the reference corpus (specifiedvia a corpus element).
Attributes for the vp ele-ment are vshare (variation share), ishare (in-stance share), spread, and grs (see again Sec-tion 3).
In Figure 1 we provide a snapshot of whatthe repository looks like.The POS sequence of a MWE in the original lex-icon can be matched to the same value in the repos-itory, and so can the expression type, which shouldalso be specified in the lexicon, so that the relativevariation patterns can be inherited by the MWE.ReferencesM.
