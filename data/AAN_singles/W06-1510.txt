The scope possibilities of aquantifier are determined by its surface po-sition, its base position and the type of thequantifier.
In this paper we propose a mul-ticomponent analysis for German quanti-fiers computing the scope of the quantifier,in particular its minimal nuclear scope, de-pending on the syntactic configuration itoccurs in.1 Introduction: The data(1) A man loves every woman.?

This is different inGerman where word order is crucial for scope pos-sibilities.

Mindestens eine Frau haben vieleat least one womanacc have manyM?nner hofiert.mennom flattered.
?Many men have flattered at least one woman.
?viele > eine, eine > vieleIn German, for quantifiers in base order, the sur-face order determines scope.1 (2a) has only thescope order viele > eine corresponding to sur-face order, that is, the inverse order eine > vieleis not available.
In contrast to this, if the wordorder differs from the base order, ambiguities arepossible.
(2b) for example displays both scope or-ders, viele > eine and eine > viele.In the literature, the following generalizationshave been noticed for German: For two quantifiersQ1, Q2 with Q1 preceding Q2 in the surface orderof a sentence, the scope order Q1 > Q2 is alwayspossible.
Furthermore, the inverse reading Q2 >Q1 is possible if(Q1) Q1 has been moved so that Q2 c-commandsthe trace of Q1 ((Frey, 1993)), and(Q2) Q1 is a weak quantifier (e.g., irgendein?some?, viele ?many?, cardinals) ((Lechner,1998)).Evidence for (Q2) ?and further evidence for(Q1)?
are the examples in (3)?(4).
In (3), the (a)-example is in base order and thus has only surfacescope, but moving the weak quantifier over the da-tive quantifier in the (b)-version results in scopeambiguity.
This contrasts with (4).
In (4), the (a)-version with base order has only surface scope, asbefore.
But now we move the strong quantifierover the dative quantifier, and this does not yieldambiguity.
That is, even though the dative quan-tifier c-commands the trace of the moved quanti-fier both in (3b) and in (4b), only when the moved1Throughout the paper we assume an unmarked intona-tion.
With a different intonation, other scope orders becomeavailable because of the change in information structure.
Butthis lies outside the scope of this paper.The base order depends on the verb; in most cases it is Sub-ject - (Indirect Object) - Direct Object.73element is a weak quantifier do we obtain scopeambiguity.

Because of this, he argues for anon-movement-based theory of German quantifierscope.
However, Kiss?
claim is not true as can beseen with the example (5) from (Frey, 1993):(5) a. weil der freundliche Museumsdirektorbecause the friendly curatornom[mindestens einer Frau]1at least one womandat[fast jedes Gem?lde]2 gezeigt hatalmost every paintingacc has shown?because the friendly curator has shown almost ev-ery painting to at least one woman?Q1 > Q2, ?Q2 > Q1b.
weil [mindestens einer Frau]1 [fast jedesGem?lde]2 der freundliche Museumsdi-rektor t1 t2 gezeigt hatQ1 > Q2, Q2 > Q1In both cases, (5a) and (5b), the two quanti-fiers are in base order.
According to Kiss thereshould be, contrary to fact, no ambiguity in (5b).The difference between the two is that in (5a) thequantifiers are in base position while in (5b) bothof them have been scrambled with the result thatQ2 c-commands the trace of Q1.
We assume with(Frey, 1993) that this is why the inverse scope or-der becomes available.We therefore stick to the above-mentioned gen-eralizations (Q1) and (Q2) and try to capture themin our LTAG analysis.
This means that, in order tocapture (Q1), we need a syntactic analysis of Ger-man NPs that takes into account movement andbase positions.2 English quantifier scope in LTAGWe use the LTAG semantics framework from(Kallmeyer and Romero, 2004; Kallmeyer andRomero, 2005).
Semantic computation is done onthe derivation tree.
Each elementary tree is linkedto a semantic representation (a set of Ty2 formu-las and scope constraints).
Ty2 formulas (Gallin,1975) are typed ?-terms with individuals and situ-ations as basic types.
The scope constraints of theform x ?
y specify subordination relations be-tween Ty2 expressions.
In other words, x ?
yindicates that y is a component of x.A semantic representation is equipped with asemantic feature structure description.
Semanticcomputation consists of certain feature value iden-tifications between mother and daughter nodes inthe derivation tree.
The feature structure descrip-tions do not encode the semantic expressions oneis interested in.
They only encode their contribu-tions to functional applications by restricting theargument slots of certain predicates in the seman-tic representations: They state which elements arecontributed as possible arguments for other se-mantic expressions and which arguments need tobe filled.
They thereby simulate lambda abstrac-tion and functional application.
A sample featurefor this simulation of functional application is thefeature I that serves to pass the individual con-tributed by an NP to the predicate taking it as anargument.
Besides this functional application as-pects, the feature structure descriptions also con-tain features that determine the scope semantics,i.e., features specifying boundaries for the scopeof different operators.
Sample features for scopeare MINS and MAXS encoding the minimal and74maximal scope of attaching quantifiers.Features can be global (feature GLOBAL, hereabbreviated with GL) or they can be linked to spe-cific node positions (features S, VP, .
.
.
).
The latterare divided into top (T) and bottom (B) features.The equations of top and bottom features linkedto specific node positions in the elementary treesare parallel to the syntactic unifications in FTAG(Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1988).
The global fea-tures that are not linked to specific nodes can bepassed from mothers to daughters and vice versain the derivation tree.
(6) Everybody laughs.As a sample derivation let us sketch the anal-ysis of quantificational NPs in English from(Kallmeyer, 2005).
Fig.
1 shows the LTAG anal-ysis of (6).
More precisely, it shows the deriva-tion tree with the semantic representations and fea-ture structure descriptions of laughs and every-body as node labels.
The feature identificationsare depicted by dotted lines.
The semantic repre-sentation of the NP everybody contains the gen-eralized quantifier every that binds the variable xand that has a restrictive scope 4 and a nuclearscope 5 .
Furthermore, it contains the proposi-tion person(x) that must be part of the restrictivescope (constraint 4 ?
l3).
Concerning functionalapplication, the NP provides the individual vari-able x in the global feature I as a possible argu-ment for the verb predicate laugh.l1 : laugh( 1 ),2 ?

?Figure 1: LTAG analysis of (6) everybody laughsQuantificational NPs in English can in princi-ple scope freely; an analysis of quantifier scopemust guarantee only two things: 1. the propositioncorresponding to the predicate to which a quanti-fier attaches must be in its nuclear scope, and 2. aquantifier cannot scope higher than the first finiteclause.
(Kallmeyer and Romero, 2005) model thisby defining a scope window delimited by somemaximal scope (global feature MAXS and someminimal scope (global feature MINS) for a quanti-fier.
In Fig.

In order to capture this, our anal-ysis needs to take into account movements (scram-bling, topicalization, etc.)
of NPs including tracesat base positions.
We therefore cannot adopt theanalyses proposed by (Rambow, 1994) in V-TAGwhere the slot for the NP is generated at the sur-face position and there is only one initial tree forNPs, whether moved or not.2(8) a. .

Therefore,either the NP or the slot of the NP must be localized togetherwith the corresponding trace inside one elementary structure.This elementary structure can be a tree or, in MCTAG, a setof trees.75c.

For the syntax, we adopt a multicompo-nent analysis for NPs that have been moved con-sisting of an auxiliary tree for the moved mate-rial and an initial tree for the trace.
Our analysiscan be adopted using V-TAG (Rambow, 1994) orsomething in the style of SN-MCTAG (Kallmeyer,2005).
Note that, in order to account for scram-bling, we need some type of MCTAG anyway, in-dependent from quantifier scope.VPNP VPNP Vliestfor each NP, e.g., irgendein Buch:?1NPirgendein Buch???????????????????

An MCTAGderivation tree as defined in (Weir, 1988) with eachnode representing a set is available only for tree-local or set-local MCTAG, not for the MCTAGvariants we need (SN-MCTAG or V-TAG).
There-fore we take the undelying TAG derivation treeas the derivation structure semantics will be com-puted on.4 Semantics of German quantificationalNPsBecause of the generalizations above, the fol-lowing must be guaranteed: i) Strong quantifiersscope over the next element in surface order (takescope where they attach).3 ii) The minimal nu-clear scope of a weak quantifier is the closest ?un-moved?
element following its base position.
Con-sequently, we need different lexical entries forweak and strong quantifiers.We characterize the scope possibilities of aquantifier in terms of its minimal scope.
Considerfirst the verb tree for liest ?read?
in Fig.
5.
In con-trast to English, MINS is not a global feature since,depending on the position where the quantifier at-taches, its minimal scope is different.
In the liest-tree, MINS appears in the feature structure of dif-ferent nodes, with each MINS value determined inthe following way: the value of MINS at the NP2address is the label l1 of the verb; the value ofMINS at the NP1 address depends on what is at-tached at NP2 (see variables 4 and 0 , which inthis case will be identified with each other); andthe value of MINS at the top VP address dependson what is attached at NP1 ( 5 ).3But see section 5, where more complex examples showthat this generalization needs to be refined.76VPNP1 VPNP2 Vliestl1 : read( 1 , 2 )3 ?

?Figure 6: Quantifiers in base positionThe idea is that, when an NP (part) is attachedat a given address, the label of that NP is the newMINS to be passed up the verb tree; when a trace(part) is attached instead, the MINS of the verb ad-dress is passed up unmodified.
This feature pass-ing is technically achieved by articulating the VPspine with the feature MINS (much like the useof the P feature in English for adverbial scope inKallmeyer and Romero, 2005), and by adding thefeature NEXT for passing between NP substitutionnodes (since substitution nodes do not have T andB features that allow feature percolations betweenmothers and daughters).The lexical entries for the three types of quanti-fiers we must distinguish (non-moved quantifiers,weak moved quantifiers and strong moved quanti-fiers) are shown in Fig.
6?8.
Quantificational NPsthat have not been moved (Fig.
6) receive theirMINS boundary (variable 9 ) simply from their at-tachment position.
Weak and strong quantifiersthat have been moved differ in how their ownMINS is determined: Strong quantifiers (see Fig.
7)get their MINS from the VP node they attach to,i.e., from their surface position (see variable 13 ).In contrast to this, weak quantifiers (see Fig.
8) gettheir MINS from the base order position, i.e., fromtheir trace position (see variable 18 ).????????????????????????????????????

In the first case, it is astrong quantifier, in the second case a weak quanti-fier.
For Fig.

11 shows the syntactic analysis for (9).
Ac-cording to the treatment of weak quantifiers pro-posed above, the minimal nuclear scope of irgen-dein Lied is determined by the position of thetrace; it is therefore the proposition of singen.
Asfor fast jedem, its minimal nuclear scope is re-quired to include the proposition of versprochenhat.
Nothing else is required, and consequentlyirgendein can scope over or under fast jedem.A problematic configuration that can occur withscrambling concerns cases where two weak quan-tifiers Q2 and Q3 have been moved with a thirdquantifier Q1 preceding them where Q1 is either astrong quantifier or a weak quantifier in base posi-tion.
Then Q1 has scope over Q2 and Q3 but thescope order between Q2 and Q3 is unspecified.

?Q1 > Q2 > Q3, Q1 > Q3 > Q2The syntactic derivation is shown in Fig.
12.Such examples are problematic for our analysis:our approach predicts that Q2 and Q3 have thesame minimal scope, namely the zeigen proposi-tion, and that the minimal scope of Q1 is the quan-tifier it precedes, namely Q2.
But nothing in theanalysis prevents Q3 from having scope over Q1,contrary to fact.This example indicates that the generalization(i) in section 4 -that the minimal scope of a strongquantifier is the proposition of the next quantifierin surface order- needs to be refined.
More accu-rately, the minimal scope of a strong quantifier isthe highest proposition following in surface order.We propose to model this using the feature NEXTalso in VP nodes.
Here NEXT stands for the max-imal scope of all quantifiers following in surfaceorder.
An attaching weak quantifier has to do twothings: 1. equate the current NEXT feature withthe new MINS that provides the minimal scope forhigher strong quantifiers, and 2. state that NEXTis its own maximal scope.
The corresponding re-vised lexical entry for moved weak quantifiers isshown in Fig.
13.Fig.
14 shows the way the minimal scope forthe unmoved quantifier in (10) is computed fromcombining the auxiliary trees of the moved weakquantifiers with bereit.

Moved weakquantifiers take the NEXT feature as their maximalscope and pass it as the new MINS.
This is howin Fig.

A (weak or strong) quantifiersubstituting into the NP slot takes this new MINSas its minimal scope.
Consequently, it scopes overboth moved weak quantifiers.6 ConclusionIt has been shown that, although quantifier scopeis usually read off surface word order in German,ambiguities can arise from movement of weakquantifiers.
We have developed an MCTAG anal-ysis using traces.
In our approach, the scope pos-sibilities of a quantifier are characterized in termsof its minimal scope.
