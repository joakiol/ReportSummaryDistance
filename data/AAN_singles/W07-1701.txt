Balto-Slavonic Natural Language Processing 2007, June 29, 2007, pages 1?10,Prague, June 2007. c?2007 Association for Computational LinguisticsSlavonic Information Extraction and Partial ParsingAdam Przepi?rkowskiInsitute of Computer SciencePolish Academy of SciencesOrdona 21, 01-237 Warsaw, Polandadamp@ipipan.waw.plAbstractInformation Extraction (IE) often involvessome amount of partial syntactic processing.This is clear in cases of interesting high-level IE tasks, such as finding informationabout who did what to whom (when, where,how and why), but it is also true in caseof simpler IE tasks, such as finding com-pany names in texts.
The aim of this paper isto give an overview of Slavonic phenomenawhich pose particular problems for IE andpartial parsing, and some phenomena whichseem easier to treat in Slavonic than in Ger-manic or Romance; I also mention varioustools which have been used for the partialprocessing of Slavonic.1 IntroductionThe aim of this paper is to give a general but ratherbiased overview of the problems of Information Ex-traction (IE) in Slavonic.
In particular, I discusslinguistic phenomena which make IE in Slavonicharder than in Germanic or Romance, ?2, but alsothose which seem to make it easier, ?3.
We will alsolook at various general tools which have been usedin IE tasks in the context of Slavonic languages, es-pecially at tools for partial (or shallow) parsing, ?4.I deal mainly with Polish, as a good representa-tive of the Slavonic family: although Polish is a rela-tively large language, with about 44 million nativespeakers world-wide (over 38 million in Poland),the availability of linguistic resources and tools forthis language does not reflect this fact: it comparesunfavourably with Czech, and probably favourablywith, say, Ukrainian.2 Slavonic is HardThere are various characteristics of Slavonic lan-guages1 that make them more difficult for automaticprocessing, whether shallow or deep, than Germanicand Romance languages.2 The two of them whichare most conspicuous, and identified as most prob-lematic, e.g., in (Collins et al, 1999), are rich nomi-nal inflection (?2.1) and free word order (?2.6).
Oth-ers, causing problems to varying extents, include:idiosyncratic inflection of Slavonic proper names(?2.2); unstable inflection of some foreign names(?2.3); high degree of trans- and, especially, intra-paradigmatic syncretisms (?2.4); and, on the moresyntactic level, the infamous quirkiness of numeralphrases (NumPs; ?2.5).2.1 Rich Nominal InflectionThe rich nominal inflection of Slavonic makes al-ready the most basic IE task, namely Named En-tity Recognition (NER), more difficult than in Ger-manic or Romance.
Slavonic nouns, apart from in-1Many of the typological features discussed below dis-tinguish between, on the one hand, East Slavonic (Russian,Ukrainian, Belorussian, Rusyn), West Slavonic (Czech, Slovak,Upper and Lower Sorbian, Polish, Kashubian) and the Westernsubgroup of South Slavonic (Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, Slove-nian), and, on the other hand, the Eastern subgroup of SouthSlavonic (Bulgarian and Macedonian).
In this and the next sec-tion I concentrate on the former group of Slavonic languages.2By shallow or, equivalently, partial processing, I mean thetask of finding some syntactic structure without using lexicalresources such as valence dictionaries; by contrast, deep pro-cessing involves finding the complete sentence structures withthe use of such lexical resources.1flecting for number (singular and plural; in Slove-nian and Sorbian also dual), famously inflect forabout 6 (e.g., Russian, Slovenian) or 7 (e.g., Czech,Croatian, Polish, Ukrainian) cases: the exact numberof cases cited in the literature for any particular lan-guage often depends on the granularity of descrip-tion, so Belorussian and Slovak have either 6 or 7cases, depending on the inclusion in the descriptionthe rare vocative forms, among the 7 Serbian cases,dative and locative are sometimes conflated becausethey ?only?
differ in accent, the Polish case systemmay be extended to 8 cases by postulating the dis-tributive case (Gruszczyn?ski, 1989, p. 89), while thenumber of Russian cases may also be reasonably in-creased to 8 by adding a second genitive and a sec-ond locative case (Jakobson, 1958).While for many European languages a dictionaryof lemmata of proper names is sufficient for the taskof NER, (Steinberger and Pouliquen, 2007, ?3.3)note that ?a minimum of morphological treatment?is required for languages with rich nominal inflec-tion, such as Balto-Slavonic or Finno-Ugric lan-guages.
Unfortunately, for the majority of Slavoniclanguages, there are no (freely) publicly available re-sources that could provide such ?minimum morpho-logical treatment?
of proper names.
For example, theonly large free (but not open source) morphologi-cal analyser for Polish, Morfeusz (Wolin?ski, 2006),contains very few proper names.3 Moreover, the NEcontent of commercial analysers is often rather low,so that simple resource-light heuristics sometimesgive better results (Urban?ska and Mykowiecka,2005, p. 214).
Such heuristics usually involve thecreation of inflected forms by adding typical suffixes(Popov et al, 2004; Urban?ska and Mykowiecka,2005; Steinberger and Pouliquen, 2007), where thesuffix addition/substitution rules are either hand-generated (Urban?ska and Mykowiecka, 2005) orautomatically acquired (Steinberger and Pouliquen,2007).3A new version of Morfeusz, containing a large dictionaryof proper names, is being prepared, but it is currently not clearif it is going to be freely available for non-commercial researchpurposes (M. Wolin?ski, p.c.
).2.2 Different Inflection of HomonymousCommon and Proper NounsAs mentioned in (Piskorski, 2005) and discussedat length in (Piskorski et al, 2007b), many Pol-ish surnames have the same base forms as com-mon names, for example, GRZYB (lit.
?mushroom?
),GO?A?B (lit.
?pigeon?)
or KOWALSKI (lit.
an adjec-tive from ?smith?).
This is a problem in itself inrecognising proper names, but it is further exacer-bated by the fact that such proper nouns may havedifferent gender values, and different inflectionalparadigms, than the corresponding common nouns.For example, while the common nouns GRZYB andGO?A?B are, respectively, inanimate masculine andanimate masculine (cf.
fn.
5), the corresponding sur-names are virile or feminine, depending on the de-notation; in case of singular feminine names, theywould not overtly inflect at all, while in case of sin-gular masculine or plural uses, the forms are oftendifferent than corresponding common forms, e.g.,the accusative singular and plural forms of GO?A?Bwould be go?e?bia and go?e?bie, when used as a com-mon noun, and Go?a?ba and Go?a?b?w, when used asa surname, etc.
Obviously, once properly described,such inflectional differences may actually help inNER.2.3 Difficult Inflection of Foreign NamesA problem relatively minor in comparison to otherproblems discussed here is the inflection of foreignnames: although it is governed by strict prescrip-tive rules, native speakers are often unaware of themand different variants of the same form may be en-countered in text; for example, while in Polish thecorrect spelling of the singular instrumental form ofLINUX is Linuksem, the variant Linuxem is at leastas common, and the starkly wrong Linux?em andLinux-em are also quite frequent.
Similarly, proba-bly few Poles realise that the correct locative formsof BRANDT and PEIRCE are Brandcie and Peirsie,and not, say, Brandtcie and Peirce?ie, and that al-though the locative of REMARQUE is Remarque?u,the instrumental is Remarkiem.4 A comprehensiveNER should be able to deal with various incorrectforms of foreign NE occurring in Slavonic texts.On the other hand, the inflection of proper names4See http://so.pwn.pl/.2depends on their pronunciation, i.e., on their ori-gin.
For example, the genitive of CHARLES is ei-ther Charlesa or Charles?a, depending on whetherit is an English name or a French name.
Anotherexample, from (Piskorski et al, 2007b), is WILDE,whose genitive form is either Wilde?a (English) orWildego (German).
This feature, when properly en-coded, may actually help distinguish between enti-ties in NER.2.4 Tagset Size and SyncretismsA rich inflection system also implies that the sizeof the tagset is very large.
For example, given thata Polish nominal form may have one of 2 numbers,one of 7 cases and one of 5 genders,5 there are 70possible nominal tags, not counting gerundial andpronominal forms.
In fact, there are 4179 possibletags in the IPI PAN Tagset of Polish (Przepi?rkowskiand Wolin?ski, 2003a; Przepi?rkowski and Wolin?ski,2003b), of which around 1150 occur in nature(Przepi?rkowski, 2006b).
Similarly, sizes of Czechtagsets range from 1171 (Hajic?
and Hladk?, 1997),through 1631 (Pala et al, 1998), to theoreti-cally 4257, but ?only?
about 1100 actually used(Mirovsk?
et al, 2002).
Such detailed tagsets makeit difficult to reach high accuracy, which ?
on theassumption that syntactic parsing is preceded by fullmorphosyntactic disambiguation ?
has negative in-fluence on syntactic processing.Another problem connected to the rich inflectionsystem of Slavonic languages is the large numberof syncretisms.
For example, a typical Polish adjec-tive may have 11 textually different forms (e.g., forBIA?Y ?white?
: biali, bia?a, bia?a?, bia?e, bia?ego, bi-a?ej, bia?emu, bia?y, bia?ych, bia?ym, bia?ymi), but asmany as 70 different tags (2 numbers ?
7 cases ?
5genders).
There are also various systematic nominalsyncretisms which to some extent annul the advan-tages that rich case system presents for the identi-fication of grammatical roles.
For example, in plu-5Traditionally, 3 genders were assumed for Polish, as formany other European languages, but (Man?czak, 1956) conclu-sively shows that at least 5 gender values must be adoptedin Polish: virile (called also m1, personal masculine and hu-man masculine), animate masculine (m2), inanimate mascu-line (m3), neuter and feminine.
Although this repertoire of gen-ders was only recently adopted in general dictionaries (Ban?ko,2000), it is still rather conservative; e.g., (Saloni, 1976) pro-poses 9 genders.ral, Polish non-virile (non-human-masculine) nounshave the same form in the nominative and in theaccusative, while in the singular, inanimate mascu-line and neuter forms do.
Similarly, virile and an-imate masculine nouns have the same singular ac-cusative and singular genitive forms.
So, for exam-ple, in the rather artificial sentence Samochody dwieminuty wyprzedzaja?
autobusy ?
(The) cars (for) twominutes are overtaking (the) buses?, each of samo-chody, dwie minuty and autobusy may be interpretedas either nominative or accusative, i.e., as the subject(nominative), the object (accusative) or a temporaladjunct (accusative).2.5 Numeral PhrasesAn area of Slavonic syntax very well-known intheoretical linguistics is the syntactic behaviour ofNumPs (Corbett, 1978; Franks, 1995); numeralsalso turn out to be awkward for automatic process-ing in various ways.6First, the case of the noun (phrase) within anNumP depends on the numeral7 and on the positionof the whole NumP in the sentence.
For example,for NumPs in the subject position, the noun is in thenominative case, roughly, if the numeral is or ends in2, 3 or 4 (with the exception of 12, 13 and 14), and itis genitive otherwise.8 This means that the shallowprocessor should recognise as a possible currencyquantity the sequence 152 dolary and 155 dolar?w,but not *152 dolar?w or *155 dolary.9Second, in case of ?typical?
numerals (not endingin 2, 3 or 4), the Polish NumP in subject positiondoes not agree with the verb; instead, the verb oc-curs in the default 3rd person singular neuter form,106One of the largest formal grammars of Polish, (S?widz-in?ski, 1992), implemented as a wide coverage deep parser in(Wolin?ski, 2004), does not deal with NumPs at all.
Later mod-ifications of the parser in (Ogrodniczuk, 2006) include somelimited treatment of numerals.7This property turned out to be problematic for adapting theGF Parallel Resource Grammar to Russian (Khegai, 2006).8Another exception is JEDEN ?1?, which is actually an adjec-tive, rather than a numeral (Przepi?rkowski, 2006a).
Also, thedescription above holds for non-virile genders, but is even morecomplicated for virile.9The latter may occur in contexts like: .
.
.
wed?ug paragrafu155 dolary nie sa?
s?rodkiem p?atniczym w Polsce ?.
.
.
accordingto paragraph 155 dollars are not a valid currency in Poland?.10I argue elsewhere (Przepi?rkowski, 1996; Przepi?rkowski,2004b) that such NumPs in subject position actually bear theaccusative case; hence, the lack of agreement.3which may make discovering the subject-verb rela-tion more difficult.Finally, and rather marginally, ?typical?
NumPsin copular constructions trigger very atypical agree-ment with the predicative adjective, e.g.
: 40g?os?w by?o niewaz?nych/niewaz?ne ?40 votes be-3RD.SG.NEUT invalid-PL.GEN/ACC?.
It is easy tooverlook such constructions when developing a shal-low grammar, and ?
since they are rare ?
it is dif-ficult to learn them automatically from corpora.2.6 Free Word OrderLast but certainly not least, the relatively free wordorder11 makes the discovering of who did what towhom (when, where, how and why) much moredifficult than finding the relative order of NPs andPPs in the sentence.
It may seem that the rich casesystem may help here, as ?
with active forms ofverbs ?
subjects are usually nominative and ob-jects are often accusative, but matters are much morecomplicated because of the widespread syncretismsmentioned in ?2.4, esp.
the systematic nominative-accusative and accusative-genitive syncretisms, andbecause both complements and adjuncts may be ex-pressed by the same cases (e.g., accusative temporaladjuncts may look like objects of transitive verbs).While the relatively free word order is seriouslyfelt in deep parsers and leads to the multiplication ofanalyses, to the best of our knowledge most IE workin Slavonic to date has concentrated on lower-leveltasks such as NER and, hence, has not yet tried tosystematically deal with this problem.3 Slavonic is EasyOn a more positive note, the rich Slavonic inflec-tional system may help at the higher levels of pro-cessing.
There are various linguistic phenomenawhere overt case, gender and number agreementallows to differentiate between interpretations and,hence, to extract the information about who did whatto whom.
To give two trivial constructed examples:the English sentence I saw him drunk is ambigu-ous in ways that are necessarily disambiguated by11Of course, the term free word order as applied to Slavonicmeans that the word order is conditioned largely by informationstructure (i.e., not really free); modelling the constraints of in-formation structure on word order is particularly important intext generation (Kruijff-Korbayov?
and Kruijff, 1999).the two Polish translations of that sentence: Widzi-a?em go pijany ?
(I) saw him drunk-NOM?
and Widzi-a?em go pijanego ?
(I) saw him drunk-ACC?.
Perhapsmore interestingly, the lexical aspect of Slavonicverbs may make conspicuous the meanings whichare only implicit in other languages, as in the PolishSkoczy?
na st??
?
(He) jumped-PERF on (the) table-ACC?
versus Skaka?
na stole ?
(He) jumped-IMPERFon (the) table-LOC?, both translated into the EnglishHe jumped on the table.One phenomenon important for high level IEwhere the rich inflectional system plays a positiverole, however, is coordination.Coordination is infamous both in theoretical lin-guistics and in Natural Language Processing (NLP);in fact, while recent years witnessed an increase oftheoretical linguistic works on various aspects of co-ordination, it seems that NLP lags behind in address-ing this phenomenon head on.
One of the exceptionsis (Dale and Mazur, 2007), which deals with theproblem of identifying the number of Named En-tities (NEs) in expressions of the form ?X and Y?,where X and Y are sequences of capitalised words,e.g.
: ?Victorian Casino and Gaming Authority?
(sin-gle entity) or ?American Express and Visa Interna-tional?
(two entities).
(Dale and Mazur, 2007) notethat the problem is statistically non-negligible, asaround 5.7% of sequences of capitalised words withan optional conjunction (i.e., candidates for NEs)actually contain a conjunction.
Similarly, (Rus etal., 2007, p. 229) discuss the bracketing problem inphrases such as ?
[soccer and tennis] player?
and?navy and [marine corps]?, noting that ?
[p]arsingbase Noun Phrases ... is not handled by current state-of-the-art syntactic parsers?.
Another kind of coor-dination ambiguity is considered in (Steiner, 2006),namely, the ?NP and NP?
sequence as either anNP-coordination, or a part of sentential coordination(where the first NP is an object of the preceding verband the second NP is the subject of the followingverb).Slavonic rich inflection makes the processing ofsuch potentially coordinate structures easier.
For ex-ample, case disagreement between two apparentlycoordinated NPs is a strong clue that they in factbelong to separate coordinated clauses, while agree-ment is a (perhaps weaker) clue that they form an ac-4tually coordinated NP.12 Similarly, (dis)agreementin case, number and gender may help decide whethertwo apparently coordinated adjectival forms actuallyform a coordinate structure.4 Slavonic is ProcessableAfter discussing ways in which Slavonic languagesseem to be hard or easy for Information Extraction,let us look at practical attempts at Slavonic IE, espe-cially those involving partial parsing.It seems that there have been relatively few at-tempts at applying shallow (or partial; cf.
fn.
2)grammars to particular practical tasks.
In someof these attempts no particular dedicated languageprocessing system was used to implement shallowgrammars: apparently they were coded directly inthe host programming language.One example is (Sharoff, 2004), where shallowparsing is used for the identification of preposi-tional Multi Word Expressions in Russian, withthe following explanation of reasons for performingsome language-dependent processing: ?Given thatthe word order in Russian (and other Slavonic lan-guages) is relatively free and a typical word (i.e.lemma) has many forms (typically from 9 for nounsto 50 for verbs), the sequences of exact N-grams aremuch less frequent than in English, thus renderingpurely statistical approaches useless.
?For Polish, simple shallow grammars were im-plemented for the tasks of question answering(Piechocin?ski and Mykowiecka, 2005) and auto-matic valence acquisition (Fast and Przepi?rkowski,2005; Przepi?rkowski and Fast, 2005); in the lat-ter case a grammar was implemented as a cas-cade of Perl regular expressions.
Similarly, (Zeman,2001) describes a Perl regular expression implemen-tation of a shallow preprocessor for a deep statisticalparser.
Much earlier, (Nenadic?
and Vitas, 1998; Ne-nadic?, 2000) developed shallow grammars of Serbo-Croatian for the recognition of noun phrases (NPs)and certain kinds of coordinate structures.
See also(Bekavac and Tadic?, 2007) on the recognition ofCroatian NEs with regular grammars.Moreover, for Bulgarian a more general integratedsystem was developed, called LINGUA (Tanev andMitkov, 2002), which ?
apart from modules for12Again, this test may fail due to case syncretisms; cf.
?2.4.tokenisation, morphosyntactic analysis and disam-biguation, and anaphora resolution ?
includes anNP extractor and a bottom-up grammar of Bul-garian.
This system, together with a set of shal-low patterns for identifying definition patterns, hasbeen employed in a Question Answering prototypesystem (Tanev, 2004).
Bulgarian pattern-matchinggrammars are also employed in (Koeva, 2007).Apart from these language-specific implementa-tions, there exist tools and toolboxes which facilitatevarious IE tasks, including shallow parsing.
Proba-bly the best known such a general system is GATE(Cunningham et al, 1995; Cunningham et al, 2002),which contains some NE resources for Bulgarianand Russian (Humphreys et al, 2002; Popov et al,2004) and allows to write shallow (regular) gram-mars in the JAPE subsystem (Cunningham et al,2000).A system similar in scope is SProUT (Becker etal., 2002), whose shallow parsing language allowsto write regular grammars over HPSG-style (Pol-lard and Sag, 1994) typed feature structures andwhich includes the operation of unification.
Prelim-inary work on adapting SProUT to the processingof Baltic and Slavonic languages is presented in(Droz?dz?yn?ski et al, 2003), with much subsequentwork devoted to the processing of Polish, especially,in the area of Information Extraction from medicaltexts (Piskorski et al, 2004; Piskorski, 2004a; Pisko-rski, 2004b; Marciniak et al, 2005; Mykowiecka etal., 2005a; Mykowiecka et al, 2005b; Marciniak andMykowiecka, 2007).Although GATE and SProUT may be adapted tothe processing of XML documents, they are perhapsnot the most natural choice for the further processingof morphosyntactically annotated documents in, forexample, the XCES (XML Corpus Encoding Stan-dard; (Ide et al, 2000)) format, as assumed, e.g.,in the IPI PAN Corpus of Polish (Przepi?rkowski,2004a), in the Slovak National Corpus (Garab?kand Gianitsov?-Olo?tiakov?, 2005), or in the LT4eLproject (http://www.lt4el.eu/).
SpecialisedXML-aware tools exist for such tasks.One of the earliest collections of XML process-ing tools is the LT XML library (Brew et al, 2000),whose second edition, LT-XML2 is currently underpreparation.
One of the tools in that new edition,lxtransduce (Tobin, 2005), is an efficient pro-5gram to add mark-up to XML files via regular gram-mars over XML elements; this tool is currently usedfor implementing definition-extraction grammarsfor Bulgarian, Czech and Polish (Przepi?rkowski etal., 2007).A system well-known in Slavonic NLP is CLaRK(Simov et al, 2001; Simov et al, 2002); it imple-ments various XML mechanism and proposes a lan-guage for developing shallow grammars over XMLdocuments; such grammars have been implementedfor Bulgarian, as reported in (Simov et al, 2004;Simov and Osenova, 2004).Finally, a new system, SPADE (Shallow Parsingand Disambiguation Engine), abbreviated to ???
(Unicode character 0x2660), has recently been de-veloped at the Institute of Computer Science, Pol-ish Academy of Sciences (Przepi?rkowski, 2007b;Buczyn?ski, 2007).
This tool, unlike many othershallow parsing tools,13 accepts a possibly mor-phosyntactically ambiguous (XCES-encoded) inputand performs simultaneous morphosyntactic disam-biguation and shallow parsing.
For example, the rulebelow, called P + co/kto, will match a possiblepreposition followed by a possible form of one ofthe pronouns CO ?what?
or KTO ?who?,14 it will tryto unify the selected case of the preposition withthe case of the pronoun and, if that succeeds, it willmark any non-unified interpretations as rejected andit will mark the two words as a prepositional groupwith the preposition (cf.
1 below) as its syntactichead and the pronoun (cf.
2) as its semantic head.15Moreover, any non-prepositional interpretations ofthe first segment of the match and any non-nominalinterpretations of the second segment will be markedas incorrect.
The language for specification of seg-ments is based on the query syntax of the Poliqarpcorpus search engine (Przepi?rkowski et al, 2004;Janus and Przepi?rkowski, 2007), in turn based onCQP (Christ, 1994).RULE P + co/ktoMatch: [pos~"prep"][base~"co|kto"]13But the shallow grammars for Serbo-Croatian described in(Nenadic?
and Vitas, 1998; Nenadic?, 2000) were developed withsimilar goals in mind.14Left and right context of a match may be specified; herethey are empty.15A rationale for distinguishing these two kinds of heads isgiven in (Przepi?rkowski, 2007a).Cond: unify(case,1,2)Synt: group(PrepNG,1,2)Morph: leave(pos~~"prep",1)Morph: leave(pos~~"subst",2)SPADE is currently employed for the shallow pro-cessing of the IPI PAN Corpus of Polish.5 ConclusionWhile the relatively free word order of Slavonic lan-guages makes the processing of Slavonic unambigu-ously harder, I claim that the effects of the rich nom-inal inflection are mixed: rich inflection dramaticallyincreases the complexity of low-level IE tasks suchas NER, but it is beneficial for high-level IE taskswhich involve filling scenario templates, as it facil-itates identifying grammatical roles, parsing coordi-nation, etc.
Moreover, as becomes clear on the basisof the overview of practical work on Slavonic IE inthe last decade, recent years have witnessed substan-tially increased interest and activity in the area.
