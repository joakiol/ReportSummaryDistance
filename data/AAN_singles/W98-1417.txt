co. jpAbstractThe paper discusses a framework for planning contributions in a spoken dialogue system, andfocuses especially on the three/'s: Incrementality, Immediacy, and Interactivity.
The emphasisis on communicative principles and the notion of NewInfo, or the information focus of theutterance.
NewInfo provides a natural way of to conceptualize the planning process and togenerate utterances on the level of granularity ?required in spoken interaction.1.
INTRODUCTIONThe question that we will investigate is the starting point of generation, and we argue that thisis NewInfo, the piece of new information exchanged in interaction, with which the mutual contextgets updated.
This may sound like sliding on the '!slippery slope" of (McDonald, 1993), who pointsout that the answer to the question 'how far back does generation go?'
is tied to the proportionalamounts of linguistic and contextual information in the specification which serves as the source ofgeneration.
However, we would like to stress the separation of communicative knowledge from theminimal information units used as the basis for generation, and that the selection of the informationunits and the way they axe actually communicated are subject to conditions which may requirechanges in one of the tasks before the other one is properly completed.
In (spoken) interaction,utterances consist of fine-grained information units to which the listener immediately reacts bygiving feedback or a response, and this feedback then directs the speaker to modify her utteranceaccordingly.
Hence, we might as well slide the slippery slope all the way down, and conclude thatgeneration starts simultaneously with interpretation, as a reaction to the presented information.The initial 'messag e'is then gradually specified into a linguistic expression with respect o language-specific knowledge and communicative ?
r quirements of the situation.Consequently, in this paper we focus on the three rs in generation: Incrementality, Immediacy, andInteractivity.
The research is still ongoing, so we pose questions more than provide answers.
Afterintroducing the three I's, the specific questions we will discuss are: (1) What are suitable utterance?units for exchanging information in spoken dialogues?
(2) What is the relationship between NewInfoand organisation of the task/d0main information?
(3) What kind of requirements are imposed onthe generator?
1aThroughout he paper we use generator to refer to the whole system that generates rather than analyses nat-ural language.
The component of the generation system that mostly deals with world-knowledge, tasks, plans andcommunicative goals, is called planner, while realiser is the component which concerns lexico-semantic and syntacticinformation.
Sentence planning is also called micro-planning.158 .iII(III?

THE THREE I' SConsider the following telephone dialogue, taken from the ATR EMMI corpus (Loken-Kim et al,1993).
A conference participant calls the conference office and asks for information on how to getto the conference center from Kyoto station.
(1) IE: /breath/ (and I wondered if you could) \[ah\] I'm at Kyoto Station just now and I wonderedif you could give me information on how to get to the conference centerA: Certainly \[ah\] where exactly are you in Kyoto StationIE: \[um\] (I) I've just come on the Shinkansen from \[ah~ Tokyo so I'm just outside the tracksA: /breath/OK \[um\] you're going to .ant to look right ahead of you and you'll see a {large}(staircase) stairwellIZ: { \[umhuh\] } \[uhuh\]A: you're going to want to go up that set of stairsIE: \[uhuh\]A: walk across a platformIE: \[uhuh\]A: and then down the stairs and out what is ?referred to as the central exitIE: nKA: you'll probly be able to see signs from where you're standing now signs towards thecentral exitIE: \[all\] yes I see {(ha') hachi} somethingA: {(o ' )  OK}IE: OKA: OK you wanna follow those signs until you're basically out {of Kyo}to stationIE: {\[mhm\]} \[mare\]A provides detailed instructions of how IE can get out of Kyoto station~ as the first step towardsthe main goal to get to the conference center.
The route is divided into parts, and the pieces ofinformation are given incrementally to IE.
After each piece of information, A-pauses for a whileand IE acknowledges the receipt of the information.
Later in the dialogue the following occurs:(2) IE: / l s /  a l l  r ight  that  sounds  \[ah\] easy enough (cou ld)  I wonder i f  you cou ld  te l l  me arethere  any in teres t ing  \[ah\]  s ights  around that  a rea  ( I )  I be l ieve  there 's  a break  a t  theconference at some point and I was just wondering if there's anything interesting to seeA: \[ah\]  yes actually that's a very \[um\] interesting part of (the city) Kyoto city \[urn\]close to thi conference center is a shrine called Heian shrine and ({it da}tes back) Idon't know if you're familiar with Kyoto historyIE: { ?hmm\] }A: or not but Kyoto (y') was the former capital of JapanIE: \[uhuh\]A: and in that particular time (instead of being referred to) the city itself was notreferred to as Kyoto it was referred to as HeianIE: \[unhu{n\] }A: ({an}d so) which in Japanese has the idea of peace or tranquilityIE: \[unh{un\] }A: {so} that shrine is actually very historic in the city itselfIE: \[uhuh\]A: and depending on the day that you go there could be various events heldIE: \[ .uhuh\]?
A: and (it's) it's very easy to locate because you'll see a large orange gateIE: \[uhuh\]A: \[tun\] and (it's) it's a well-known landmark within the cityIE: nKA: and across the street from thi shrine itself there's a museum {Kyoto} Art MuseumIE :  {\[uhuh\]} +\[aha\]+159A: +so+ many people are also familiar with that so it's actually quite easy to find your wayIE: nKA: " I would say from the conference center if you're going to walk it..ould problybe about \[um\] fifteen minutesIE: \[uhuh\]A: fifteen minutes on footIE: \[oh\] .OK sounds very easy to reachThis example has a similar structure to the previous one: A gives information which IE acknowl-?
edges.
However, there is no clear p lan structure that guides A's incremental descriptions.
Rather,each piece of information js connected to the previous one via topical associations: the name ofthe shrine ~sociates with the 01d name of Kyoto and peace and tranquility, while the gate withwhich the shrine is easy to locate, MSo serves as a landmark of the whole city.
These topical chains,?
:shown in Fig: 2, are quite different from the task structure in Fig.
1 which underlies dialogue 1: Arelies on her knowledge of the domain and the different relations between the concepts rather thanon a hierarchial plan.
This type of generation provides an interesting challenge to NLG systems ingenera/, since it not only requires flexible focus shifting (McCoy and Cheng, 1991; Hovy and McCoy,1989) but also that the communicative principles governing associative chains are spelled out.Two unusual interactions, though characteristic of spoken dialogues, also take place in dialogue 2.In the beginning , A starts to provide information about the interesting places to visit around theconference center, but soon realises that a foreign conference participant does not automaticallypossess knowledge of such historical facts as what period a shrine dates back ?
to.
A thus repairs herutterance completely and produces a remark about her ignorance.
IE's evasive feedback confirmsA's tacit assumptions of IE's scarce knowledge of Kyoto% history, and is embedded inside A's turn.Although A's remark can also function as an indirect request for IE to indicate her knowledge state.on the matter, A continues her original utterance as if IE had only provided backchannelling andnot taken a full turn.
Mutual knowledge has thus been established without an explicit question-answer exchange.
This is an example of immediacy of reaction: the speakers monitor their owncontribution s , and closely follow what the partner says.
The information exchange is managedlocally by presenting new information to the partner who then analyses, evaluates, and reactsto the new information in the current dialogue context (Clark and Schaefer, 1989; Traum, 1994;go(Ag.KS.CC) " ~ thei~'r?~-tr~~ $?c ?nlgo(~J,KS:OutKS) oo(Ag OutKS,CC) ( ~~- - - '~  ~ ~/&&& & .

However, the listener does not initiate the response only after the speaker hasfinished speaking, but rather, starts response generation immediately, simultaneously as the speakerspeaks.
The listener signals her understanding of what is being said by explicit or implicit feedback 2(Allwood et al, 1992), and she may even co-produce utterance units (Fais, 1994).The other peculiar interaction occurs at the end of the dialogue.
A has volunteered informationabout how long it takes to walk from the conference center to the museum, and IE acknowledgesthis.
A may have reasons to suspect hat IE has not really understood the presented information, soshe repeats it to make sure that it is correctly integrated into mutual knowledge.
This is an exampleof the interactivity of communication.
The whole dialogue of course is already an interactive vent,but the subtle point here is the use of repetition as a rneans of interaction managemen?.
Sincethe factual information in a repetition is already known, the relevance of such an utterance arisesfrom the very act Of repetition and new information is looked for on a metalevel, i.e.
on the level ofinteraction management.
In this example, repetition functions as an effective turn release, signallingto the partner that she needs to confirm the information in a more convincing way .

.In NL generationl conversational spects have been addressed especially in interactive xplanationand instruction generation (Cawsey, 1993; Carletta, 1992; Moore, 1995; Inui et al, 1996).
Inthis paper we approach the problem from the view-point of spoken interaction, and outline areactive response planner which takes into account he speaker's communicative n eds and the newinformation intended to be conveyed, based on the three/~s discussed above.3.
INFORMATION STRUCTURE OF  UTTERANCES3.1.
P rosod ic  in fo rmat ion  un i t sIt is commonly agreed that sentences are not appropriate units for spoken interactions; rather,the object of study is the utterance, variably defined with the help of speech acts, turns, turn-constructional units, and intonational units.
In generation, the genera\] control flow goes fromconceptual information to the string of words (ultimately: sounds), and the question of a suitableutterance unit gets rephrased as a question of the minimal information unit that constitutes thebasis for generation and can deal with the three rs  as well as be prosodically identified.According to Stenstr5m (1994), the speakers' turns are orga~ised into information units: eachunit has its information focus marked with a nuclear tone, and usually the word with a nucleartone occurs at the end of the unit.
For instance, phrases like WALK across a PLATFORM, wherecapitalization marks the pitch-prominent words, are segmentd into two information units consistingof the two nuclear words.
However, from the view-point of generation, we regard the phrase as asingle unit, since both 'walking' and 'across a platform' are new information on the discourse level.We thus distinguish between information units which are minimal constinuents on the prosodiclevel (accented words), and information units which are minimal units on the discourse level (newinformation).
Our NewInfo unit can be prosodically complex, and it thus corresponds to whatPierrehumbert and Hircshberg (1990) call an intermediate phrase: it contains one or more accentedwords and a-phrase accent (high or low tone) at the end.
One or more intermediate phrases plusa boundary tone then make Up an intonational phrase, roughly corresponding to anutterance.2Ward (1997) discusses the reflexive nature of backchannels and demonstrates how they can be generated in ahighly interactive system relying only on acoustic features like the pitch and the length of pauses.1613.2.
NewIn foand Cent ra l  ConceptTo model the information content of utterances, we use the notions Central Concept (CC) andNewlnfo (NI) (Jokinen, 1994; Jokinen and Morimoto, 1997).
These notions are related to thelinguistic topic-comment s ructure (what is talked about vs. what is said about it) and the focus-ground structure (new vs. old information), but defined in terms of discourse referents, i.e.
objectsused bythe planner.
3 They can be realisedby linguistic phrases: analogously tO Grosz et al (1995),we say that U realises d if U is a Phrase for which d is a discourse referent in the context model.CC is the discourse referent which the utterance is about or which the participants focus theiractions on.
Given the plan in Fig.
1, at the beginning of the dialogue CC is fixed to the instantiateddiscourse referent go( id l ,  agl ,ks,  cc),  corresponding to the top goal, and can then shift to subgoalinstantiations, depending on the  planner's action.
In the topic network Fig.
2, CC is first theinstantiated iscourse referent of the node shrine, ther/shifts to kyoto, heian, etc.
The shifting,however, is now constrained by the organisation of domain knowledge and topic associations: thecurrent NI becomes the next CC, and the next NIis one of its salient properties or property values.CC fixes the view-point from which NI is presented, and its realisation depends on the context:object-type CCs may be realised as pronouns (IT ~ a well-known landmark), but if recoverable fromthe context, CC need not be explicitly present at all (fifteen minutes on foot has its CC "distancefrom conference center to shrine" omitted).
CC is not necessarily old information: for instance, indialogue 1, when A gives the first step in directing IE out of Kyoto Station (g ?
up that set of stairs),C C is go ( id i ,  agl  ,ks ,  outks )  ("get out of Kyoto Station") which is not mentioned in the contextbefore.
On the other hand, this is not NewInfo either, since it is not realised, but inferrable (Prince,!979): expansion of the goal has resulted in the NewInfo go( id3 ,ag l , sh in t racks ,upsta i r s ) ,which is realised in the utterance, and from which CC is to be inferred.
Conversely, old informationneed not be CC.
For instance, before instructing IE to go up the stairs, A has introduced thestairwell and then refers to it as part of mutually known background information: go up THAT setof stairs.
However, A is not talking about the stairs but the way to get out of the station.NewInfo is the information centre of the utterance, identified as the discourse referent(s) to bepresented, but  not yet established as part  of mutual knowledge.
NI is always explicitly realised,with the prominent pitch accent.
It is selected on the basis of the fine-grained task structure, if suchexists, Or the topic associations in the domain, and further specified with, or rather, wrapped in, com-municatively important information.
The  wrapping may only contain some morpho-syntacticallyrequired specifications, o NI becomes realised via a direct mapping to words (walk across a plat-form) and is prosodically marked as an intermediate phrase.
A more complex NI (causal relation,comparision), or a more complex communicative situation (explanation, egotiation), may requiremore elaborate wrapping so NI becomes realised as a complex intonational phrase.4.
REQUIREMENTS FOR A GENERATORWe now move onto  the requirements hat the three /'s impose on a generator.
Assuming thatonly relevant information is communicated to the partner and that the most relevant informationin a given context is the new information, we conclude that the starting point for generation isNewlnfo.
Furthermore, considering the three/'s,  (1) NewInfo can be gradually specified as needed3A similar distinction ismade by Vallduvl in terms of link and focus, but his concern is in cross-linguistic realisationof information packaging, not in dialogue management (Vallduvi and Engdahl, 1996).162in incremental generation, (2) it is the unit which the immediate reaction is a reaction to, and(3) its obvious repetition directs the hearer to look for the relevant interpretation on the level ofinteraction rather than on the level of factual information exchange.We do not discuss real-time planning, but the reactive nature of the generator.is obvious: undertime pressure, the planner may want to give the most important part of the message (NewInfo)to the realiser first, then provide further specification as necessary.
Since content planning andrealisation are theoretically parallel processes (de Smedt and Kempen, 1987), the realiser maythus start saying something immediately after NewInfo has been decided, and produce temporizers(uhmm, errr) while waiting for the next piece of information from the planner.j -I Parser INaturalLanguageFront-et~cII So.aceReal iser /1ss |p lanIn for rnsayin form -Comm.s t rateg iesD ia logueManager  - mJ~tyse - ~luate- re  8 l~om:dqueryIn form -- -  i n fo rmCol laborat ivest rateg iesTaskManager  "l~oblemsolver"| ,, !

cAIn  fo rFigure 3:  Architecture of a dialogue system.
SpR and SS refer to speechrecognition and speech synthesis, respectively.To meet these requirements we consider a highly modular system architecture depicted in Fig.
3.The different components are independent "agents" which operate within their own expertise areabut can communicate with each other via a simple "agent communication language" (Fig.
4).
Eachagent can also query and update the Context Model (CM) which records the ongoing dialoguestate.
Planning is divided into task and dialogue planning (Cawsey, 1993): the task manager (TM)produces plan recipes in regard to a particular application and the current plan, while the dialoguemanager (DM) plans the system's communicative actions.
DM can request TM to give a suggestionof what to do next, and TM can query DM of a parameter value.
DM processes requests by theparser (PR) to  plan a response to auser utterance in the cycle of analysis, evaluation, and response(3okinen, 1996), and in particular, its planning also concerns content organisation into utterances.Language-specific knowledge is stored in a linguistic lexicon and used b.y an incremental surfacerealiser (SR), say of the type described in (Wilcock and Black, 1998).
DM requests SP~ to realise aset of concepts, and the realiser must be capable of producing elliptical and fragmentary utterances.TM and DM operate on concepts defined in the World Model and the mapping from task-relatedentities to linguistic words 4 is described in the Conceptual Lexicon (not shown in Fig.
3).The pieces of information communicated to the user depend on the task that gave rise to thecommunication in the first place.
Task information is fine-grained and decomposed into subgoals,4We assume that words can first be underspecified and can then be gradually specified into the final words by thesurface realiser, cf.
Zock (1993).163request(PR,DM,plan,Sem)request(DM,TM,plan,Goal)request(DM,SR,say,Sem)request(XX,CM,upd,Param)request(TM,DM,stat,Cond)request(TM,DM,val,Param)request(XX,CM,val,Param)inform(DH,pR,Sem,Stat)inform(TM,DM,Goal,Plan)inform(SR,DM,Sem,Stat)inform(CM,XX,Param,Stat)inform(DM,TM,Cond,Stat)inform(DM,TM,Param,Val)(PR requests DM to plan a response to Sem)(DM requests TM to plan a recipe for Goal)(DM requests SR to realise Sem)(XX requests CM to update context with Param)(TM queries DM whether a Cond is true or false)?

The subgoals mayhave knowledge preconditions, uch as a constraint on mutual knowledge concerning the agent'slocation, which must be fulfilled before the act can be executed, s The concepts describing thecontent of a plan are linked to a world model hierarchy which describes the ontology of the domainand also plays an important role in tracing topic associations.
Each instantiated world modelconcept is a discourse referent in the Context Model; in particular, events and actions are discoursereferents.
A plan operator corresponding to the top level plan of Fig.
1 is represented as follows:? "
goal: go(Id,Ag,ks,cc)constraints: location(Ag,inKS)subgoal : go (id2, Ag, inKS, outKS)subgoal : go(Id3,Ag, outKS,cc)effects : location(Ag, cc)The immediate communicative goal, ICG, is an intention to realise the current NewInfo, and thecommunicative goal, CG, is a generalisation of ICG, an intention to realise some concepts, notnecessarily NI.
6 TM provides DM with NewInfo which can be a plan step, a knowledge precondition,or a concept in the world model.
The content of the immediate communicative goal can thus varyfrom ?concepts and basic acts to general actions subsuming complex action sequences.An important question, posed by Inui et al (1996), is the granularity of the fine-grained unitsin the plan.
There is a need to provide information in units which are suitable for incrementalpresentation and can function as minimal units for the partner's reaction, but there is also a needfor aggregating the fine-grained units into bigger ones to maintain coherence of the dialogue.
Similarconsiderations have been expressed by Hovy and Wanner (1996) on microplanning: one of the tasksof the sentence planner is sentence content .delimitation, but so far little computational research asaddressed the question of when and how to divide information into distinct sentences.
We thinkthat NewInfo is helpful in this respect, since it is a flexible unit: defined as a minimal informationunit on a given planning level, it can be of different complexities, thus allowing efficient informationexchange, cf.
Inui et al (1996).
It can also be further specified ("wrapped"), if inappropriate forSin fact, the f irststep of the plan in Fig.
1, go(Ag,KS,0utKS) can be considered as a plan to get the mutualknowledge precondition mknow(sys,ag, location(ag,outKS) of the ?second step fulfilled.CThe speakers normally have several other goals as well, concerning their intentions on the other levels of com-munication: on a task level the goal is to complete the Current ask; on a manipulative l vel the speaker may wantto persuade, argue, agree, etc; and on a collaborative l vel she may have commitments o other (joint) goals.164!;||iIlIIcommunication.
Dia/ogue coherence is thus a matter of communicative strategies imposed on theplans and domain knowledge rather than hierarchical organisation of knowledge sources as such.5.
GENERATION AS WRAPP ING OF  THE NEWINFODM decides on the appropriate communicative intention and the presentation f NewInfo, especiallythe level of explicitness in the utterance, and its content organisation.
DM exploits a number ofcommunicative strategies, and collects the concepts to be rea/ised in Agenda.
At each planningstage, DM evaluates Agenda with respect o the strategies, and augments it with relevant conceptsas needed.
At each stage, it can request SR to realise Agenda, i.e.
the system cam start "talking".Agenda is initialised with the Newlnfo concepts related to the current ICG (one of DM,s own.pending oals, or received from TM as a response to DM's "what-next'-request).
This means thatthe simplest realisation for a communicative goal is the realisation of NI concepts.
For instance, ifIGC is info_request ( locat ion( id i ,ag l ,X ) )  and there is no more time to plan further, DM canask SR to realise this, the result being an elliptical, fragmentary utterance: Location?/Where?
Ifthe content of Agenda is not valid in the context (and there is more time to plan), DM continuesits planning.
It may notice that in the current dialogue situation, a complete intonational phrase isdesirable, since this would force the partner to take an explicit turn.
Moreover, if the NewInfo thatuser has just presented concerns location, aresponse with an elliptical question about location wouldget interpreted on the meta-level, and may, as in dialogue 1, convey false implicatures: Where?would most likely be interpreted as a sign of problems in telephone lines, while Location?
be simplyincomprehensible.
DM may thus direct SR to produce a sentence instead of other syntactic phrases.In evaluating the communicative adequacy of Agenda, DM may also notice that Agenda does notdirectly address thepartner's intentions, and NI must be further specified.
There are three differentcases for NI wrapping.
First, the present communicative goal may be ambiguous in its intentions.DM may notice that if it requests SR to realise the goal info_request ( locat ion( id l ,  agl ,X)) asa full intonational phrase ( Where are you?
), the utterance is not accurate in the context: besides re-questing specification of the partner's current location, it can also be understood as a question abouther location in general.
Since the partner has already said her location is Kyoto Station, the lat-ter interpretation should be blocked, to avoid false implicatures being drawn (interpretation themetal-level, or simply as being rude).
Thus DM specifies the content of the communicative goal withthe location information and the goal becomes info_request (sys, ag l , locat ion( id l ,  ag !
,X),l ocat ion( id2 ,X ,ks ) ) .
NewInfo is thus "wrapped" into a piece of information that makes thereference Point clear (in Kyoto Station), probably with the empahsis added (exactly).Second, NewInfo may contain reference to objects which are crucial in fulfilling the task, and soit is cooperative, and sometimes communicatively more efficient, to make sure that the objectsare mutually known.
For instance, the starting point in instructing IE out of Kyoto Station is thestaircase which IE is to go up.
If s ta i rcase  appears in the Context Model as an uncertain discoursereferent (i.e.
it is not known whether the partner knows it or not), DM may introduce the conceptvia a separate inform-act, before giving the instruction to go upthe  stairs.
In fact, this is whathappens in the sample dialogue.
NewInfo is go ( id4, ag, sh in t racks ,upst  a i rs )  and wrapped intothe goal in fo rm(sys ,ag l , locat ion(s ta i rcase , in f ront ) ) ,  which is communicated first (afterrecursive planning for its suitable realisation).Third, TM may give DM a conjunctive NewInfo, which consists of several plan steps.
For instance,165instead of delivering each of the five steps of how to get out of Kyoto station separately to DM, TMmay give them all at once (after reasoning that all the steps are leaf-nodes in the current plan andcannot be expanded).
Since each conjunct is an independent NewInfo, DM has a choice of passingthe conjuctive goal to SR as such (to be realised as a single, but long conjunction of utterances), ordrop each NewInfo separately to SR, with a pause after each item requiring the partner's explicitacknowledgement.
The decision is based on the intentions: descr ibe would prefer the former, butins t ruct  the latter realisation.Context consideration also affects TM's planning.
Collaborative task planning requires that thepreconditions of a goal are fulfilled.
If the Context Model does not provide necessary informationto TM, it can query DM, which would then plan a request o the user, and forward the user's replyback to TM.
Playing safe, TM can make sure that the preconditions for each plan step are fulfilledbefore providing DM with a plan.
it can also choose a more risky strategy and provide DM withthe plan :(conjunctive NewInfo) at once.
In this case, DM is responsible for realising the plan aswell as monitoring its execution.
TM may also-keep the control of the plan execution in its ownhands, but allow DM to handle (problem s with) knowledge preconditions.
The choice between thedifferent control strategies is related to system's overall behaviour: communication between TMand DM takes time, and the dialogues become cumbersome if the user's knowledge is constantlyqueried, but if too much is assumed, backtracking and repairs may be necessary (Carletta, 1992).Generation of associative topic shifts (dialogue 2) proceeds analogously.
However, instead of relyingon the decomposition of the task, TM uses a domain model (concept network).
Topical associationsare based on chaining the current NewInfo as the next CC, and selecting the next NI according tothe topic shifting rules described in (McCoy and Cheng, 1991).
For instance, the shift to "peaceand tranquility" is justified as a shift to the attribute Sern of the object Heian-name.
However,TM does not know whether its associations make communicatively appropriate topic shifts, sosuggestions must be filtered by DM.
A possible topic shift to "war and destruction" after lingeringon "peace and tranquility!
~ of Heian-name can thus be rejected by DM, if the shift violates thecommunicative strategy that says that the distance between the current CC and the main topic(sight-seeing information around the conference center) should not be larger than a given limit.Onthe other hand, DM does not know whether a topic is exhausted or there might be somethingmore to say about it, so it has tO request a new one.6.
CONCLUSIONThe paper proposes a framework for planning dialogue contributions and emphasises the three/ 'sfor generation: Incrementality, Immediacy, and Interactivity.
The starting point for generationis NewInfo, the new information intended to be realised, which in the course of planning, getswrapped with regard to the communicative context and the communicative n eds of the speakers.Modularity of the system architecture allows the planners to communicate with each other, and thusrealisation canstart once NewInfo has been decided.
Planning can continue separately, and includepragmatic onsiderations like those described in (H0vy, 1988).
NewInfo is realised via intermediateprosodic phrases which correspond to one or more words with a pitch accent.
We envisage thatthe model also serves as a basis for integrating NLG research into speech synthesis (Black andCampbell, 1995).
We continue research on the different constraints and their interaction.7.
