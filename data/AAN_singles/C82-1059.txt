)North-Holland PubltJhing CompanyAccdcm~ 1982PARSING GERMANIngeborg Steinacker,  Harald TrostDepartment  of Medical  Cybernet icsUnivers i ty  of ViennaThe first part of this paper is dedicated to an overv iewof the parser of the system VIE-LANG (Viennese LanguageUnderstanding System).
The parser is a product ionsystem which uses an inter leaved method that combinessyntax and semantics.
It parses d i rect ly  into theinternal representat ion of the system, without producingan intermediate syntact ic  structure.
The last partd iscusses the re lat ionship between some special  featuresof the German language, and propert ies  of the parserthat or ig inate in the language.GENERAL APPROACHA sentence is parsed word per word, from left to right.
The parseris largely a data-dr iven product ion system.
Product ions involve theuse of syntact ic  and semant ic  information at all major stages of theprocess.
Noun phrases,  for example, are recognized by an ATN whichver i f ies  the result of syntact ic  analysis  semantical ly .
It returnssemant ica l ly  valid NPs only.
The parser belongs to the class ofsemantic parsers as suggested by \[I\], \[4\], \[7\].
It has two mainsources of information: one is a semantic net, which propagates theinformation about select ional  restr ict ions,  the other is thepars ing- lex icon,  which for each word conta ins d i f ferent  sensesassociated with the information necessary to d ist inguish one sensefrom the others.
Informat ion includes syntact ic  features of thesentence (infinit ive, sur face-cases  of dependent  noun phrases .... ),semant ic  restr ict ions and words that occur together with theinput-word.The product ions make use of a correspondence between syntact icinformation in the sentence and the roles of the net (see chapterinternal representat ion for an explanat ion of roles).
Product ionsare used not only for generat ing the internal representat ion ofconst i tuents  but also as expectat ions  that guide the analys is  of therest of the sentence.The generat ion of the internal structure corresponding to thesentence is centered around the verb.
Since the representat ion ofother const i tuents  can be init iated independent ly  of the verb, theparser bui lds a semant ic  structure immediate ly  after a const i tuentis recognized.
These structures are stored in a list, until themain verb of the sentence has been found.
Then the parser tr ies tofill the case-s lots  of the verb with the given structures.
Thesemant ic  categor ies  of the structures have to be matched against thevalue restr ict ions of the roles of the verb.INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONThe source of semant ic  informat ionNet \[2\].
This net formal ism hasep is temolog ica l ly  c lear and expl ic it .is a Structural  Inher i tancethe advantage of beingSI -Nets are based on a str ict365366 I. STEINACKER and H. TROSTdiscr iminat ion between few structural  components,  and their content(what is represented).
Real world knowledge is represented in theform of concepts and roles.
Roles explain re lat ionships betweenconcepts.
A concept is def ined by its at t r ibutes  wh ich  consist  oftwo parts: the role and the value restr ict ion.
The valuerestr ict ion is a concept which def ines the range of poss ib le f i l lersfor the attr ibute,  the role def ines the funct ion of a fi l ler withregard to the concept being defined.
Ro le- f i l le r  concepts can beregarded as semantic categor ies.Gener ic  concepts are organized in a h ierarchy of super-  andsubconcepts.
A subconcept  inherits the at t r ibutes  of thesuperconcept.
If a concept has more than one superconcept  itinherits the combined set of attr ibutes.
When process ing an inputindiv iduals  of the addressed concepts are instant iated.
Theseindiv iduals  const i tute  the episodic  layer of the net.A word sense addresses either a concept or the attr ibute of aconcept.
If an input word relates to a concept,  as most nouns andverbs do, that concept is instant iated.
If it corresponds to a roleboth the concept and the attr ibute are instant iated,  i. e. thegener ic  concept,  the role def in ing the attr ibute and the valuerestr ict ion.
Most ad ject ives  and most prepos i t ions  are mapped intoroles (size, colour, location, time, .... ) but also some nouns(e.g.
father is the role of a person in the concept family).The net is structured in a way that fac i l i tates  the incorporat ion ofresults gained in l inguist ics:  attr ibutes of act ions are def ined ina way corresponding to cases of a case grammar.
This can  best bei l lustrated by an example: Act ions are represented as net-concepts ,e.g.
DO.
The concept DO is def ined by at t r ibutes  with roles likeAGENT, OBJECT, GOAL, RESULT, that are restr icted by adequatero le- f i l ler  concepts.
By def in ing at t r ibutes  in this way acorrespondence between surface cases in a sentence and roles of thenet can easi ly  be establ ished.THE PARSING-LEXICONIn the pars ing- lex icon  each word-sense is associated withproduct ions.
These product ions  ref lect the correspondence betweensurface cases of the sentence and semant ic  cases within the net.The number of tests in a product ion corre lates  to the number ofsenses of a word.
By execut ing these tests the parser gains theinformat ion necessary  to choose the correct  reading of a word.Tests check the syntact ic  and the semant ic  context  in which an inputword  is found.
Somet imes morpholog ica l  informat ion and theoccurrence of certa in words have to be taken into cons iderat ion  aswell.
The range of tests ref lects our general  approach to parsing:combining syntax and semant ics  at all stages of the pars ing process\[8\].Depending on the stage of the process the fai lure of a test isinterpreted in two ways.
If the end of the sentence has beenencountered the result  is taken as false, if pars ing is in progressthe test is repeated at later stages of the process.Act ions associated with the tests most ly  deal with semant ics t ructure-bu i ld ing procedures.
Some act ions are used to control  thePARSING GERMAN 367pars ing process.
Usual ly  the semantic st ructure for a const i tuentof the sentence is bui lt  after the const i tuent  is recognized butact ions can delay the creat ion of net-structures.
The reasons forsuch a delay are expla ined in the fol lowing chapter.A verb-sense is recognized by taking into cons iderat ion thesyntact ic  surroundings of the verb and the semant ic  categor ies thatmatch the select ional  restr ict ions def ined by the verb.
After averb-sense has been chosen expectat ions are bui lt  up regardingmiss ing const i tuents.
The occurrence of certa in surface-structuresalso leads to the formation of expectat ions.
Therefore tests thatare associated with verbs first check the surface structure of thesentence (cases, prepos i t ions.
.
. )
.
The const i tuents  that sat is fythese syntact ic  tests have to fulf i l l  semantic select ionalrestr ict ions.
After having passed these tests, act ions create thesemantic representat ion for the verb and fill its roles with theselected const i tuents.Unless an entry in the lexicon includes a test regarding subject andobject of a sentence the fol lowing default  act ions are executedautomatically: the subject of a sentence is mapped onto the AGENTand the object (accusative) is mapped onto the OBJECT of the action.A Detai led ExampleThe two senses of 'gehen' in the fol lowing example can bed isambiguated by using the entr ies in the pars ing- lex icon l istedbelow (parts of the entry which are irrelevant to the example areleft out).
These sample entr ies include important kinds of testsand actions.
(i) 'Ich gehe in den Park.'
(I walk into the garden.
)(2) 'Der Bus geht nach Wien.'
(The bus is bound for Vienna.
)gehenl  (move along)C((CASE NOM) AND (RESTRICTION ANIMATE)) ->A(CRI LOCOMOTION)gehen2 (bound for)C((CASE NOM) AND (RESTRICTION PUBL.-TRANSPORT.))
->A(CRI (PUBL.-TRANSPORT))C(PLOC) ->A (CRV(+,DESTINATION,*)) .In the example the '+' parameter is an individual  of the conceptPUBL.
-TRANSPORT,  the '*' parameter is the locat ion expressed by theprepos i t ional  phrase, namely Vienna.
The nounphrase 'Ich' (I)ful f i l ls  the restr ict ion ANIMATE, because speakers are alwaysinterpreted as humans.Surface-tests:Case-tests  search for an NP of the surface-case indicated by thesecond parameter.
If an NP is found that sat is f ies  the condit ion,the tests that are connected by AND or OR to the case-test  areexecuted.
The const i tuent  of the sentence which sat is f ies the testsis referred to with an aster ix '*' in the assoc iated action(s).The test PLOC refers to a preposi t ional  phrase that indicates somelocation.
It is a test which uses syntact ic  and semant ic368 I. STEINACKER and H. TROSTinformation.Restr ict ion-tests :These semantic tests are used to check select ional  restr ict ions.They are often used in combinat ion with syntact ic  tests.
If bothtests are met by a const i tuent  this is a s ign i f icant  indicator,  thatthe correct interpretat ion has been selected.St ructure-bu i ld ing Actions:The act ion CRI(concept)  creates an individual  of the concept.
Theact ion CRV(pl ,p2,p3) indiv iduates an att r ibute of the concept pl.The concept pl, the role p2 and the concept P3 as va lue- res t r i c t ionare ins tant ia ted .
If pl or p3 are addressed by '+' the parameterrefers to the first concept that was indiv iduated when process ingthis part icular  entry in the pars ing- lex icon.
A '* ' -parameterrefers to the semant ic  representat ion of the const i tuent  whichsat is f ies  the first test of the product ion.SPECIAL FEATURES OF GERMANMorpholog ica l  Ambigu i t iesWe bel ieve that making use of the interact ion between syntax andsemant ics  has many advantages over a s t r ic t ly  sequent ia l  approach toparsing.
Introducing semantic informat ion helps to resolve someambigui t ies  at an ear ly stage of the analys is  and thus to avoidunnecessary  backtrack ing.
Typical ly ,  morpho log ica l  ambigui t ies  canbe resolved by such an interact ion.The German language is rich in inf lect ional  forms, therefore themorpholog ica l  component  often comes up with more than one poss ib lestem for an input word.
These stems usual ly  belong to d i f ferentcategor ies of words, e.g.
'meinen' can be interpreted as a verb (tosuppose) or it can be reduced to the possess ive pronoun 'mein' (my).Syntax restr icts  the type of a const i tuent ,  which is expected at agiven point in the analysis .
Usual ly  it is suf f ic ient  to usesyntact ic  informat ion to d isambiguate morpho log ica l  ambigui t ies  ofthis kind.If a word is reduced to two d i f ferent  stems of the same category ofwords, se lect ional  restr ic t ions in the semant ic  net are used tochoose one stem.
The pars ing- lex icon re lates surface cases tosemant ic  restr ic t ions of the at t r ibutes  of the action.
In mostcases this informaton is suf f ic ient  for disambiguation.The inf lected form 'gehoert' is reduced to the two verbs 'hoeren'(to hear) and 'gehoeren' (to belong to).
(3) Dieses Buch gehoert  mir.
(This is my book.
)(4) Hast du dieses Geraeusch gehoert?
(Did you hear that no ise?
)In (3) the subject of the sentence has to be a 'POSSESSIBLE OBJECT' ,in (4) the object of has to be a subconcept  of 'SOUND'.
A v io lat ionof se lect ional  restr ict ions,  is a clear indicator that the wronginterpretat ion of the verb has been chosen.PARSING GERMAN 369Disconnected Const i tuentsAnother character is t ic  feature of the German language is the verbsecond phenomenon.
In German a verb can occupy three d i f ferentpos i t ions within a sentence: the first in quest ions  and commands,the second in main clauses,  and the last in subordinate clauses.Compound predicates  are div ided into two parts.
The auxiliary orthe modal verb hold %he place of the verb, and the rest of thepredicate is put at the end of the sentence.
One has to deal with atwo-piece predicate whenever compound tenses are used, in st ructuresinvolving the inf in i t ive etc.For a parser that uses a tradit ional  approach of sequent ia lsyntact ic  and semant ic  process ing these features cause extensivebacktracking.
The method of combinig syntact ic  and semant icanalysis  does not avoid backtracking complete ly  but it makesre- interpretat ion easier.
This claim is supported in the fol lowingparagraph using the example of a compound predicate.
(5) Mein Bruder hat das Buch, yon dem du mir erzaehlt  hast,schon gelesen.
(My brother a l ready read the book, which you told me about.
)In (5) the object and a relat ive clause separate the two parts ofthe predicate.
One poss ib le  reading of the verb 'haben' is topossess.
The object  'das Buch' sat isf ies the semantic restr ict ion'POSSESSIBLE-OBJECT' ,  therefore 'hat' is taken as the predicate anda possess relat ion is establ ished between the representat ions  forsubject and object.
When the past part ic ip le  'gelesen' isencountered at the end of the sentence this decis ion has to berevised in favour of the compound predicate 'hat gelesen' .The possess relat ion which was establ ished has to be replaced by theconcept that is addressed by 'lesen, namely ' INFORMATION-TRANSFER' .The semantic representat ions  of the object book and the relat iveclause are not af f l ic ted by this change.
Book also fits into theh ierarchy of ' INFORMATION-SOURCE'  and therefore sat isf ies theselect ional  restr ict ions for the object of ' INFORMATION-TRANSFER'also.Separable pref ixes also add to the problem of f inding the rightverb.
Syntact ica l ly  verbadjuncts  are part ic les,  that are part ofthe verb.
In some tenses a verbadjunct  becomes separated from theverb and is put at the end of the clause.
Verbadjuncts  can speci fythe verb, but somet imes they change its sense complete ly  (aufhoeren= to stop, hoeren = to hear).
(6) Das Kind hoert nach einer Stunde endl ich zu weinen auf.
(After an hour the child f inal ly stops crying.
)Such features either cause delay in th~ construct ion of the internalrepresentat ion for a sentence, or they result  in backtrack ingbecause the correct meaning of the verb becomes apparant  at the endof the sentence.CONCLUSIONThe structure of the German language adds some d i f f icu l t ies  to thegeneral  problem of pars ing natural  language.
Flexib le word-order370 I. STEINACKER and H. TROSTand multiple sources for ambiguities led us to choose a data-drivenapproach.
Syntactic and semantic information are used fordisambiguation of existing structures and for expectations thatcontrol processing of new input.Since backtracking is inevitable in some cases we tried to make itas efficient as possible.
The integration of syntax and semanticsfacilitates backtracking to a large degree because semanticrepresentations for all constituents are built independently.
Ifbacktracking occurs e.g.
after having selected a wrong verb-sense,the parser has to destroy the existing semantic representation andreplace it with the one indicated by the new verb.
The slots of theinstantiation of the concept for the new verb have to be filled withthe already existing structures instead of having to start the parseall over again.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis research is part of the project 'Development of a NLU Systemwith regard to Medical Applications' (supervision R.Trappl), whichis supported by the Austrian 'Fonds zur Foerderung derwissenschaftl ichen Forschung', grant #4158.REFERENCES\[I\] Boguraev, B.K., Automatic Resolution of Linguistic Ambiguities,University of Cambridge, (1979).\[2\] Brachmann, R.J., A Structural Paradigm for RepresentingKnowledge (Bolt Seranek and Newman, 1978).\[3\] Buchberger, E., Steinacker, I., Trappl, R., Trost, H.,Leinfellner, E., A NLU System for Medical Applications, SIGART79 (1982), 146-147.\[4\] Gershman, A.V., Knowledge-Based Parsing, Yale Univ.,RR-156,(1979).\[5\] .den, G., On the Use of Semantic Constraints in GuidingSyntactic Analysis, Univ.
