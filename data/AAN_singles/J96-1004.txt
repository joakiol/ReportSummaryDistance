From Conceptual Time to Linguistic TimeMiche l  Gagnon*Machina SapiensGuy  Lapa lme tUniversit4 de Montr4alIn this paper, we present a method for generating French texts conveying temporal informationthat integrates Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) and Systemic Grammar Theory.
DRTis used to represent temporal information and an intermediate s mantic level for the temporallocalization expressed by temporal adverbial phrases and verb phrases.
This representation isthen translated into a syntactic form using Systemic Grammar Theory.
We have implementedthis method in a working prototype called Prdtexte.1.
IntroductionIn speaker-generated t xts, reference is made to facts taking place in time.
To use thesame kind of references in automatically generated text, the mechanisms that governthe expression of temporal concepts must  be  identified.
There is no simple or directmapping between conceptual time, as it is perceived in the real world, and l inguistictime, which refers to the way time is formulated in language.
There may be differentways to present he same temporal  concept in a text, and a single linguistic markercan be used to convey different emporal  meanings.For example, the discourse below (Discourse 1) is a text generated by Pr4texte,a system we developed for implementing the expression of temporal  localization inFrench texts 1.
It is a slightly modif ied version of an example used by Bras (1990) for theextraction of temporal  information in text analysis.
The sentences report occurrencesthat are facts taking place in time.
We have inserted labels in parentheses to distinguishthe twelve occurrences reported in the text.Hier l'avion a effectu6 un vol (ol).

@ 1996 Association for Computational LinguisticsComputational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1In Discourse 1, we find two types of temporal markers: verb tense and what wecall adverbials of temporal location (ATL).
An ATL is an adjunct, such as yesterday,until 10:50, or when it flew over Barcelona, that provides information about the temporallocalization of an occurrence or its duration, or both at the same time.For verb tense, we distinguish different ways of indicating localization in the past.Three French verb tenses can be used: pass~ composG imparfait, and plus-que-parfait; theirclosest equivalents in English are the simple past, past progressive, and past perfect.The passf compos~ il a survold 'it flew over' presents the occurrence as an event andlocalizes it in relation to the time of speech.
With the plus-que-parfait il s'dtait allum~ 'ithad come on', the occurrence is also presented as an event, but localized in relationto a perspective point other than speech time.
The imparfait le r~acteur fonctionnait 'theengine was working' presents the occurrence as being in progress.
For present andfuture tenses there are fewer options than for past tense, but more than one form isavailable for theses tenses as well.For ATLs, temporal localization can be achieved in many ways; for example, inrelation to the time of speech (hier 'yesterday'), by designating an absolute temporallocation (~ 8hO0 'at 8:00 A.M.'), or in relation to another fact (puis 'then', ~ ce moment-ld'at this moment', quand il a survold Barcelone 'when it flew over Barcelona').
To thisvariety in the semantics of localization we must add the variety of syntactic forms.Localization can be expressed by an adverb (puis 'then'), a prepositional phrase (jusqu'd10h50 'until 10:50'), a nominal phrase (le lendemain 'the day after') or a subordinateclause (quand il a survold Barcelone 'when it flew over Barcelona').No text generator has yet been developed to solve the problem of the expressionof time.
The ones that have tackled this problem have focused on the production ofverb tenses, without solving the choice of temporal adverbs.
The work presented inthis paper addresses the problem of generating the elements that convey temporallocalization in French, including both verbs and temporal adverbs.In a previous paper (Gagnon and Lapalme 1992), we proposed a method of inte-grating the expression of temporal concepts into the text-generation process.
In par-ticular, we showed how to produce different ypes of text in French from a singlerepresentation f events.
Unfortunately, the method governing the planning processwas too determined by temporal concepts, so it was difficult to link this planningprocess with other frameworks, such as the schema proposed by McKeown (1985) orRhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann 1991; Hovy 1991).As we were not really successful in integrating the expression of time in Frenchinto the text-generation process, we decided to pursue our research with a differentperspective.
We designed a system covering many of the possibilities of expressingtime in French, our hypothesis being that the achievement of this task would facilitatethe design of a text-planning process.
We believed it would be easier to organize thestructure of the discourse with a better understanding of the way temporal informationcan be expressed by adverbs and verb tenses.
We started from the work of Bras (1990),who proposes a method of extracting the temporal structure of a text, according toDiscourse Representation Theory (Kamp 1981), that relies on an analysis of adverbialsof temporal location made by Molin6s (1990).To implement the production of ATLs and verb tenses, we have chosen SystemicGrammar (Halliday 1985; Berry 1975, 1976), which formulates the syntactic structureof a sentence as the result of a sequence of semantic hoices.
We developed a grammarinterpreter inspired by Nigel (Matthiessen and Bateman 1991), but departing from itin many respects; in particular, our representation of the production of verb tensesand adverbs is quite different.In this paper, we discuss the elements required to produce a text such as Dis-92Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic Time/DEEP /GENERATIONNfSURFACEGENERATION",ConceptualrepresentationDiscourserepresentationtSemanticrepresentation1SyntacticrepresentationOccurrences a primitive conceptsTemporal relationsThe tempolral Jocaligafion is represented as an overlapmg relationSellmentafion f the conceptual ret~resentaaonStructured informationRhetorical relationsLinearizationChoice of aspectIdentification f temporal markersTemporal dverbial Verb tenseFigure 1The global process.course 1.
The process tarts from a conceptual representation that encodes the facts tobe reported in the text, associated with their position in time.
The information at thisobjective conceptual level must be translated into a semantic representation where thefacts are presented according to a subjective perspective.
The semantic representationis then used to produce the text.
We have concentrated our attention on this last stage,but we cannot avoid the problem of determining how the representation used at thislevel is obtained from previous levels.
In the following sections, we describe the twostages of the text-generation process.2.
The Global ProcessIt is generally accepted that the generation process requires at least two parts.
Thefirst part, deep generation, is a planning process in which the content and the overallstructure of the text are established.
In the second part, surface generation, the wordsand the syntactic structure of the text are chosen.Figure 1 summarizes our view of the global process, starting from a conceptualrepresentation that contains occurrences and relations between them.
The fact thatan occurrence takes place at a certain time is expressed by an overlapping relationbetween this occurrence and the object representing this time.The deep generation process is decomposed into two steps.
In the first step, theconceptual representation is segmented and structured to build a discourse represen-tation.
In our discourse representation, which uses Segmented Discourse Representa-93Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1tion Theory (SDRT) (Asher 1993), the information is cut into smaller segments eachof which contains the information to be expressed by a single sentence.
The structurelinking these segments relies on a set of rhetorical relations.In the second step of the deep generation process, the discourse representationis traversed and, for each segment, rules are applied to identify the feature valuesneeded to translate it into a sentence.
We thus obtain a linear structure in which eachelement is a set of features that determine the syntactic form of the sentence.In the surface generation process, the information in the semantic representationis used to select the appropriate syntactic structure for the expression of time: anadverbial of temporal location (ATL) or a verb phrase (VP), or both.3.
The Deep Generation ProcessAlthough our work focuses on surface generation, we cannot ignore the issue of deepgeneration, because the nature of the semantic representation is determined not onlyby the syntax of the language, but also by the temporal concepts available.
Therefore,in this section, we first present the conceptual representation that induces the semanticrepresentation used by our generator.
We then explain the intermediate discourse level.We do not know yet in detail how to produce the semantic representation from theconceptual representation, but we do have an idea of what information each levelof representation must contain and what choices must be made at each stage of theprocess.3.1 Conceptual RepresentationTo represent temporal concepts in Pr6texte, we chose the principles of Discourse Rep-resentation Theory (DRT), which offers one of the most interesting explanations ofhow temporal notions are conveyed by a text.
DRT was developed to deal with spe-cific problems of discourse understanding: in particular, problems with anaphora ndthe differences between some verb tenses, with respect o temporal localization.
Ourgoal is not to show how this theory can be used for generation but rather to use itsprinciples as a convenient formalism for the representation f time.In DRT, a text is associated with a Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) thatis updated incrementally by the processing of each sentence.
A DRS is a structurecontaining a set of entities and a set of conditions on these entities.
There are differenttypes of entities in DRT:a temporal fact can either be presented as an event (having a punctualaspect), or as a situation (having a certain extent in time, but consideredfrom an internal perspective at a given moment in time);a temporal constant that designates a segment of the temporal axis;entities that participate in the events or situations.In Pr6texte, conceptual knowledge is represented asa DRS, which we adapted slightlyfor text generation.
We do not distinguish between events and situations in the concep-tual representation, because we want this level to remain independent of the language.Furthermore, we feel that this distinction should not be encoded at the conceptuallevel, rather the generation system should choose among these possibilities.
There-fore, at the conceptual level we use the concept of occurrence for either an event or asituation.94Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic Timen tl t2 t3 t4 01 02 03 04 a l p b rplane(a)flight(l)engine(r)city(p)Paris(p)city(b) o20  t2Barcelona(b) ol < no1: make(a, 1) o3 < no 2" leave(a,p) o~ C tlo3: flightover(a, b) o4 < n04: work(r) o3 C 04n c t3 03 C) t4tl = Sept. 10 1992t2 = Sept. 10 1992 at 8:10 amt3 = Sept. 11 1992t4 = Sept. 10 1992 at 9:00 am02 <nFigure 2Conceptual representation for the first three sentences of Discourse 1.There are essentially two ways of considering time or, to be more precise, thenotion of temporal location: either temporal location is determined using a preexistingtime scale, or it is deduced from the occurrence.
Following Kamp (1981), we think thatthe second possibility, in which temporal location is a relative concept, is more suitablefor natural text processing.
Treating occurrences as entities, rather than making themsubordinate to temporal intervals or points, has been proposed by Davidson (1967).An occurrence may be represented in relation to another temporal object, withoutany reference to its own location in time.
This approach eases the representation funderspecified temporal localizers--an important point for our semantics.
For furtherdiscussion of the advantages of taking occurrences as primitives, see (Bras 1990; Kamp1979, 1981).In the conceptual representation, we find four types of information:?
the description of occurrences;?
the description of participants in the occurrences;?
the description of temporal localizers, which are called temporalconstants (they usually refer to time periods of the calendar);?
temporal relations between occurrences and temporal localizers:The relation < represents temporal precedence.The overlap relation C) indicates that two temporal objects aresomehow simultaneous.
Thus, in our representation, "Y happensat time X" is represented by "Y temporally overlaps X".The relation C expresses the fact that the temporal extent of atemporal object is a subset of the temporal extent of anotherobject.Figure 2 shows the part of the DRS used to generate the first three sentences ofDiscourse 1.
It contains five temporal constants: n, tl, t2, t3 and t4.
It is not clear how95Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1these temporal constants are to be described in DRT, so we have proposed elsewherea formalization of the type of objects designated by these constants (Gagnon and Bras1994).
In this article, we give only an English description of them: n represents speechtime, which, in Figure 2, is included in the time represented by t3 (September 11 1992).Four occurrences are represented: ol, o2, o3, and o4, all of which take place before n.Not all temporal relations in the DRS need to be given as input because manyrelations can be inferred using three kinds of knowledge:?
The representation f conventional time to identify a specific period intime; this representation relies on a structure of conventional time,together with reasoning mechanisms to deduce temporal relations (seeGagnon and Bras \[1994\] for an implementation f such a structure).
Forexample, from this knowledge we can deduce that September 10must bebefore September 11, which would be represented as tl < t3.
Similarly, wecan deduce t2 C tl, t4 C tl, and t2 < t4.?
World knowledge about the occurrences: knowing that o2, 03, and o4 arepart of Ol implies that they are all temporally included in it.?
A reasoning mechanism on the temporal relations, using a set of axioms,such as:Vx, y (xOyvx  < yvy  < x)Vu, v ,x ,y (uOxAvOyAx < y~ uOvVu < v)The first axiom states that for any two times, either they overlap or oneprecedes the other.
The second axiom states that if two other times u, voverlap two times x, y that are in a precedence r lation, either u overlapsv, or it precedes it.So in Figure 2, from the relations 02 O t2, 03 O t4, and t2 < t4, we can infero2 < 03 V o20  o3.
From world knowledge, we can infer that o2 and 03 cannot overlap(leaving of Paris cannot overlap flying over Barcelona); Therefore, we conclude that02 ~ 03.3.2 The Discourse RepresentationTo generate a text from an input such as Figure 2, we must choose adiscourse structurethat segments the message into sentences.Figure 3 illustrates one discourse representation, i spired by the Segmented Dis-course Representation Theory (SDRT) proposed by Asher (1993), which extends DRTby adding rhetorical relations uch as those found in RST (Mann and Thompson 1987).A discourse structure that contains the same information as in Figure 2, except hatit has been segmented, we call a Segmented Discourse Representation Structure (orSDRS).
The top-level DRS contains three small DRSs that are linked by rhetorical rela-tions: each DRS corresponds to a sentence.
In addition to these three small DRSs, thetop-level DRS contains the global text information: the description of participants andthe description of speech time.
We do not yet produce this discourse structure, butwe are working on this problem, using the results of researchers who have appliedSDRT to the analysis process (Lascarides and Asher 1993; Bras and Asher 1994).
Inthe discourse structure of Figure 3, one sentence is elaborated by two other sentencesthat constitute a narration.96Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic Timeplane(a)fight(l)city(p)Paris(p)n t3 a l p b rOl tlo1: make(a, 1)tl = Sept. 10 1992Ol KnOl C tlElaborationBarcelona(b)engine(r)t3 = Sept. 11 1992n C t3 city(b)02 t2o2: leave(a, p)t2 = Sept. 10 1992 at 8:10 am02 Kn02 0 t2Narration03 04 t403: flightover(a,b)04: work(r)O3 (n04 <nt4 = Sept. 10 1992 at 9:00 am03 C 0403 0 t4Figure 3Discourse representation forthe first three sentences of Discourse 1.3.3 Semantic RepresentationThe discourse structure is then translated into a semantic representation f the form$1, $2,.

,  Sn where Si designates the i th element of a semantic representation S. Transla-tion of the SDRS is obtained by a depth-first traversal of the DRSs it contains.
For eachDRS, we establish its corresponding feature structure in the semantic representation.Figure 4 is a semantic representation produced from the SDRS of Figure 3.
Eachstructure contains five features.
The feature message refers to the occurrence that mustbe reported by the sentence, and specifies its aspect.
We distinguish, as Kamp does,two aspects that can be used to present an occurrence: event or situation.
Situationscan be open or resulting.
A situation is open when the speaker/hearer is located at atime within an occurrence.
A resulting situation is the state following the terminationof an occurrence.
In French, the event aspect for a past occurrence results in the useof the pass~ composd (simple past in English).
The impar fa i t  and the p lus -que-par fa i tcorrespond to open and resulting situations (the closest enses in English are the pastprogressive and the past perfect).
In the first two elements of Figure 4, the occurrenceis presented as an event, whereas in the last one it is presented as an open situation.Among the four occurrences contained in the DRS, only three of them constitute themain "message" of the text: ol, o2, and o4.The four other features in a structure Si give the value of four temporal markersthat express the localization of the occurrence.
These markers correspond to the fourmarkers proposed by Kamp and Rohrer (Bras 1990) for the analysis of texts, which wehave adapted for text generation.
They can be seen as an extension of Reichenbach'smarkers (1947).
Essentially, the values of these four features depend on two data:?
the DRSs to which the visited DRS is attached in the discourse structure,and?
the rhetorical relations.97Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1Figure 4message =event(ol)N=nREF = nilPERSP = nLOC = tlS1message =event(o2)N=nR =OlPERSP = nLOG = t2$2message :open_situation ( o4 )N=nR=o2PERSP = nLOC = o3S3Semantic representation for the first three sentences of Discourse 1.O1 : ....~.

Flashbackh 08: .... I06: .... \[ Narration ~, 07: .... \]F igure  5Discourse representation for the first seven sentences of Discourse 1.The marker N represents the time of speech.
This marker is constant in our exam-ple, but it could be locally altered in the discourse, in indirect speech for example.
Wedid not study such cases, but we think that the marker  N would be required to dealwith them.Perspective point PERSP refers to an instant from which the occurrence must  beconsidered.
Usually it is the same as the time of speech, but in some cases, such as aflashback, it has a different value.
In Discourse 1, there is one such case.
The fifth andsixth sentences (where occurrences o6 and o7 are reported) constitute a flashback: theperspective point is the occurrence of the fourth sentence (os).
In discourse structure,the flashback is represented with a rhetorical structure.
Consider for example thediscourse structure for the first seven sentences of Discourse 1 as sketched in Figure 5.For the translation of the two DRSs containing 06 and o7, the value of PERSP will bethe occurrence o5, since the DRS containing this occurrence dominates the two otherswith the relation flashback.
For the next DRS, the one containing os, the perspectivepoint will be reset to the value it had before entering the flashback, that is, the valuewhen the DRS of o6 was considered.The value of PERSP is used for the choice of verb tense.
In Discourse 1, theflashback results in the choice of the plus-que-parfait.LOC represents the temporal  location of the occurrence reported.
If this occurrenceoverlaps another temporal  object, this object may be used as a value for LOC.
In98Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic TimeFigure 4, the values of LOC show that tl and t2 are used to localize the first twooccurrences.
In the third sentence, the situation corresponding to o4 is presented atthe instant where o3 takes place.
If no other temporal object overlaps the one thatconstitutes the message, the temporal location represented by LOC can be defined inrelation to another temporal object.
We will see examples of this in the next section.LOC represents the information to be expressed by an ATL in the sentence and doesnot necessarily have a value, because a sentence may not contain an ATL.In a text, when we want to express a succession of occurrences, we need a wayto memorize the occurrence that is used as a reference for the localization of thenext one.
This is exactly the role of the marker REF.
The values of REF are used torepresent the progression of time in the discourse.
Each time a sentence xpresses anew temporal location (which can be an occurrence or a temporal constant), the valueof REF is updated to this new value, and the temporal localization in the followingsentence may be achieved in relation to this reference.
The following rules are usedfor identifying the value of REF:1.
Identify the S-antecedent, the DRS to which the current DRS is attachedin the discourse structure, and Sa, the feature structure associated withthis DRS in the semantic representation.2.
If the occurrence reported as message in Sa is presented as a situation, itcannot be used as a reference point, since a situation cannot state aprogression in time.3.
If LOC has a value that is temporally more precise than the occurrencein the message, REF will take on its value, otherwise REF is bound to theoccurrence in the message, if this occurrence is not presented as asituation.4.
If LOC has no value and the occurrence in the message is a situation, theantecedent sentence does not state a progress in time.
Therefore, REFtakes the same value as in Sa.In Figure 4, the context for the first sentence is empty, so no value is given toREE For the second and third sentences, the value of REF is the event presented inthe previous entence.
The occurrence in the third sentence is expressed as a situation,so it cannot be the reference for the fourth sentence (not shown in the figure).
Con-sequently, REF for the fourth sentence takes the value of LOC in the structure of thethird sentence: t4.
We will see in Section 5 how the value of REF is used to producethe temporal adverb.The choice of aspect in building the semantic structure is achieved by taking intoaccount pragmatic information and the interaction with other choices, such as thetype of temporal localizer.
Currently, we first identify the localizer that constrains theselection of aspect, but more study is needed to clarify their interaction.If an occurrence is presented as a situation, the temporal localizer must be a timeincluded in it; but an event aspect cannot be combined with a localizer.
In Figure 4,the occurrence of $1 must be presented as an event, since the localizer tl includesthe occurrence.
In $2, the occurrence is also an event, even if the localizer overlapsthe occurrence: the overlapping relation does not prevent he existence of an inclusionrelation.
If an inclusion relation between t2 and o2 could be deduced, then the situationaspect could be chosen.
In $3, the localizer is included in the occurrence of the message,so the situation aspect is selected.99Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1message =event (oi)N=nR = nilP=nL = chmessage =event(o2)N=n' R =01P=nL = ct2Figure 6An alternative semantic representation.message =event(03)N=n' R =02P=nL = ct4message =open_situation ( o 4 )N=n' R =03P=nL = ct4)The semantic representation given in Figure 4 is not unique.
Figure 6 shows an-other semantic representation built from the DRS of Figure 2.
It contains a fourthsentence.
The main difference from the previous representation is that 03, instead ofacting as a localizer for o4, is the message of a sentence; t3, referring to a momentlocated two hours after t2, localizes o3.
Therefore, instead of the third sentence ofDiscourse 1, we would obtain these two sentences:Deux heures plus tard, il a survol6 Two hours later, it flew over Barcelona (o'3).
AtBarcelone (o~).
Ace moment-la, ler6acteur this moment, he engine was working (o'4).foncfionnait (o~).Once the semantic representation is produced, the adverbial or temporal location (ATL)and the verb phrase (VP) can be generated independently.
The syntactic form of theverb phrase is determined by the combination of the following information:?
temporal relation between localizer LOC and speech time N;?
temporal relation between localizer LOC and perspective point PERSP;?
aspect of the occurrence.The choice of the syntactic structure of the ATL depends on the value of LOC,which may refer to N or REF.
The interaction of temporal information conveyed byverb tense and adverbs is taken into account in the process of translation from the con-ceptual representation to the semantic level, where the choices of aspect, perspectivepoint PERSP and localizer LOC are made.We still have not entirely solved the problem of choosing among all semanticrepresentations that can be built from a DRS.
In the current implementation f Pr6texte,we have identified a set of rules to produce the semantic representation.
I  particular,these rules insure that the values of the four temporal markers are coherent with theaspect chosen to present he occurrences.
What remains to be done, essentially, is toidentify the knowledge that governs these rules causing them to select a particularsemantic representation.3.4 Representat ion  of  Loca l i zat ionWe have argued in the previous section that four temporal markers are needed toexpress the temporal location of an occurrence.
In this section, we discuss the markerLOC, the localizer that provides information about the location in time of the occur-rence using another entity.
The localizer is usually a temporal constant, but it can alsobe another occurrence, whose approximate location in time is already known.An ATL can convey localizers of two types: in the first type, a localizer directlyidentities the temporal zone of an occurrence using another temporal object hat over-laps it; in the second type the temporal zone of an occurrence is conveyed in relation100Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic Timeto another localizer.
In Figure 4, all occurrences are localized irectly.
Occurrence 04 islocalized directly by another occurrence, whereas 01 and o2 are localized directly bya temporal constant.
For $1 and $2, the values for LOC are simply constants tl andt2.
The same temporal localization can usually be expressed in many ways, and wemust also specify how these constants are worded.
For example, in Discourse 1, T1has been translated into hier 'yesterday' but it could also have been translated into le10 septembre 1992 'September 10th 1992', or mercredi dernier 'last Wednesday'.Thus, the value of LOC in the semantic representation determines the expressionof the localization, giving rise to three main problems:?
how to represent the temporal constants in the conceptual representation;?
how to determine the link between these conceptual temporal constantsand their semantic representation, which specifies how they are to beexpressed in the text; and?
how to implement the selection mechanism, which relies on pragmaticand stylistic information to choose between the many different ways ofexpressing the same temporal localization.In Gagnon and Bras (1994), we gave a solution to the first two problems but thelast one still remains to be solved.
Here, we discuss only the second problem: thesemantic expression of localization.First, a few words about temporal context: usually, temporal localizers may beunderstood only in reference to some time in the context.
For example, in on April15th, it is assumed that it is clear which year this time is part of.
Thus, we take forgranted that all expressions of temporal localization are made in relation to such acontextual time.Let ti be a temporal constant, aken from the conceptual representation, which is tobe used as a localizer in the semantic representation, and tcont he contextual time.
Theexpression i  the semantic representation is based on a term of the following form:\[ti, Type, Naming\]The first argument is the identifier of the constant in the conceptual representation.The second argument is the type of the temporal localizer (day, month, year, etc.).
Thus,tcont may be decomposed into times of type Type, of which t i is one.
The last argumentnames the time referred to by the localizer ti.
There is exactly one time in the "realworld" that corresponds to the temporal constant ti.
We call it objective time.
We usethe notation t* to represent the objective time that corresponds to a localizer ti.For example, the expression for the temporal localizer en avril 'in April', would besomething like this (here t67 is the corresponding temporal constant in the conceptualrepresentation):\[t67, mort th, april\]The naming april is not the syntactic word "April" but an internal keyword thathelps distinguish between the time referred to and the other months of the contextualyear.An important distinction is made between a temporal constant ti and a objectivetime t*.
The constant ti pertains to the way a temporal location is expressed in thediscourse, whereas t~ can be considered the corresponding portion of time in the realworld.
More than one temporal constant may correspond to a single objective time.101Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1Table 1Relative localizers.Localizer Descriptioninclin(\[ti, Ti, Ni\],\[tj, Tj, Nj\])incl(\[ti, Ti, Ni\],\[tj, Tj, Nj\])begin(\[ti, Ti, Ni\],\[tj, Tj, Nj\])end(\[ti, Ti, Ni\],\[tj, Tj, Nj\])after(\[ti, Ti, Ni\],\[tj, Tj, Nj\],D )before(\[ti, T,, Ni\],\[tj, Tj, Nj\],D)relpos(X,\[ti, T Ni\],\[tj, T, Nj\])extent(\[ti, Ti, Ni\],\[G Tj, Nj\],\[tk, Tk, Nk\])t~ is a time included in the time t 7t* is a time that includes the time tj*t~ is a time whose beginning overlaps thetime t~t~ is a time whose ending overlaps the timet;t~ is a time after the time t~ with a temporaldistance D (expressed as a duration)t~ is a time before time t 7 with a temporaldistance D (expressed as a duration)t~ is the X th (-X th, if X<0) time of type Tafter (before, if X<0) time tj*t~ is a time period starting at time t7 andending at time t;Suppose, for example, that the discourse contains two temporal constants, correspond-ing to yesterday and two days after Robert's departure.
We can imagine a situation whereboth designate xactly the same day.
But it is not possible for a single temporal con-stant to correspond to more than one objective time.
If it were, it would mean thatan ATL could be ambiguous.
In our computational perspective, we accept some un-derspecified ATLs (not precisely specifying the temporal location), but not ambiguousones.A triplet is the simplest expression of a temporal localization.
Usually, expressing atemporal localization is more complex, because the temporal constant used as localizercannot be rendered directly in relation to the contextual time.
This is the case, forexample, if the localizer is a day, and the contextual time a year, because there isno natural way of decomposing a year into days 2.
In these cases, we must expressrelations with some intermediate localizers, until we reach one that can be related tothe contextual time.Let \[ti, Ti, Nj\] be the localizer and \[tj, Tj, Nj\], \[tk, Tk, Nk\] be intermediates localizers.Many kinds of relations can be distinguished.
They are listed in Table 1.
Note thatthese relations can be combined recursively.
This means that the triplets used as argu-ments may also be represented using a relation.
We will show examples of this in thefollowing discussion.Among the arguments of these relations, one pertains to the temporal localizer,and one (two, in the case of the relation extent) pertains to an intermediate localizerto which the temporal localizer is related.
We call this last argument an anchor, sinceit represents a time to which the relation must be "anchored" in order to deduce thetime of localization.We will now give a short discussion of the relations of Table 1.
In the follow-ing examples, hoe designates the temporal constant corresponding to the localizer ofthe occurrence, and n and trey designate the time of speech and the reference time,respectively.2 It is possible to name the day using the religious calendar, using something like the day of St-Andrew,but it is far from usual to do so, except maybe for holidays uch as Christmas, Easter, or Thanksgiving.102Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic TimeThe first relation is the most frequent for expressing temporal localization.
It isused to express localizations like le 3 avril 'on April 3rd'.
In this case, the localizercould be formulated as:inclin ( \[ tto?, day, 3\], \[t~, month, april\])As expected, the intermediate localizer tl is to be interpreted in relation to thecontextual year.
The semantics of a more complex localizer like le matin du 3 avril 1994'on the morning of April 3rd 1994' is an example of using recursivity for the expression:inclin ( \[hoc, momen t-of-day, morning\], inclin ( \[ h, day, 3\],inclin (\[t2, month, april\], It3, year, 1994\] )))The second relation, incl, is required to deal with adverbials uch as le jour oft Paulest parti 'the day when Paul left', aujourd'hui 'today' and ce jour-l~ 'that day'.
All ofthese refer to a day, but this day is not expressed in relation to a time that includes it.On the contrary, the other time is included in it: the time when Paul left in the firstexample, the time of speech in the second example, and the referent ime associatedwith REF in the third one.
Suppose that in the conceptual representation, 023 is theobject representing the departure of Paul.
These three examples could be represented,respectively, as:incl(\[hoc, day, _\], \[O23 , - ,  - \ ] )incl(\[ttoc, day, _\], \[n, _, _\])incl ( \[ tloc, day, _\], \[ tref , -, -\] )where "_" is used for arguments whose values are not relevant or unknown.The relations begin and end represent the case where only one boundary of thelocalizer is known.
This results in an ATL such as depuis le 3 avril 'since April 3rd' orjusqu'au 3 avril 'until April 3rd' where meaning is ambiguous.
What do we mean ex-actly, when we write that ti begins at time tj?
That the initial boundary of ti is includedin tj or that the ending of tj "meets" the beginning of ti?
If the answer is that tj includesthe initial boundary of ti, what is the constraint on the duration of ti?
It is clear that itmust be shorter than tj.
We do not have any answers to these crucial questions, andother similar ones.
These are problems that pertain to the deep generation process,which is not the focus of this paper.
We think that at the level of the semantic repre-sentation, this relation need not be further clarified, since it corresponds to the waytime is expressed in the language.
In fact, all our relations have this underspecifiednature.For the relations before and after, the value of the temporal distance is given as aduration, using an expression of this form:duration (N, Type)The value of the duration is obtained by calculating the period corresponding toN periods of type Type.
For example, the adverbial deuxjours apr~s le ddpart de Paul 'twodays after Paul's departure' would be represented as (023 represents the occurrence ofPaul's departure):afler(\[hoc, - -\], \[O23, -, -\], duration(2, day))If the temporal distance is not known (or irrelevent), it is indicated by indefinite.Thus, aprbs le ddpart de Paul 'after Paul's departure' would be represented as:after(\[ttoc, -,-\], \[023,-, -\], indefinite)103Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1Now, let's suppose that the localizer ti is of type T. tn some cases, a good wayto express it is by giving its position relative to another time tj of the same type.
Forexample, the ATL cinq jours plus tard 'five days later' is not used to mean "at a timein the future, five days from the reference time," but rather "the 5th day after the onewhich included the reference time."
If the reference time is itself a day, the semanticsof this ATL could be:relpos( 5, \[hoc, day, _\], \[trey,-,-\])If trey is not a day, we must express the relation by taking as anchor the day whichincludes it:relpos (5, \[ Gc, day, _\], incl ( \[ tl, day, _\], \[trey, day, -\]))(This takes for granted that the time trey is not bigger than a day.
If trey were biggerthan a day, it would not make any sense to express relative position by specifying thetemporal distance in days.
)Similarly, hier 'yesterday' would be expressed semantically as "the day that is thefirst one before the day that includes the time of speech":relpos(-1, \[tloc, day, -\], incl ( \[\[h, day, _\], \[n, _, _\]))We have seen a way of expressing duration, by giving the length as a numberof time units.
But there is another way of expressing duration: by indicating the twoboundaries of the period.
By using this method, not only the duration of an occurrenceis expressed, but so is its temporal location, at least partially.
The relation extent is usedto express this kind of duration.
For example, the semantics of du 3 avril au 5 mai 'fromApril 3rd to May 5th' is formulated as:extent(\[hoe, _, _\], inclin ( \[ h, day, 3\], \[t2, month, april\]), inclin ( \[t3, day, 5\], \[t4, month, may\]))The semantics of du 3 au 10 avril 'from April 3 to 10' should represent the fact thatthe whole duration is included in the same month:inclin (extent (\[boo -, -\], \[h, daY, 3\], \[t2, day, 10\]), \[t3, month, april\])The relation extent is also used to represent adverbials like depuis trois jours 'forthree days' and pendant rois jours ?z partir du 3 avril 'during three days starting fromApril 3rd'.
These adverbials explicitly express one of the two boundaries.
In the firstexample, it is either the time of speech or the reference time (the ATL means "forthree days until now" or "for three days until then").
In the second example, it is thetime corresponding toApril 3rd.
The other boundary is indicated implicitly by givinga temporal distance from the anchor.
The first example, supposing that the explicitboundary is speech time, would be represented as:extent(\[tloc, -, -\], before(It1, - -\], \[n, _, _\], duration (3, day)), In, _, _\])This expresses a period whose ending is the time of speech and whose beginning mustbe calculated by finding the time that is three days before speech time.The second example would be represented as:extent( \[tloc, _ _\], inclin (\[tl, day, 3\], \[t2, month, april\]), after(It3, -, -\], \[t l, -, -\], duration(3, day)))Note that in both examples, the same temporal constant represents both the explicitboundary and the anchor of the relation after or before used to express the implicitboundary (n and tl, respectively).104Gagnon and Lapalrne From Conceptual Time to Linguistic TimeTable 2Relative localizers.Adverbial Semanticsentre le 3 avril et le 10 mai inclin(\[hoo_,d,extent(\[ti,_,d,(between April 3rd and May lOth) inclin(\[t2,day,3\],\[t3,month,april\]),inclin(lt4,day,10\],lts,month,aprill)))jusqu'tt il y a trois jours end(\[h ..... -\],(until three days ago)  before(lt2,_,_\],\[n,_,d,duration(3,day)))jusqu'/i mercredi de cette semaine end(\[tloo_,_\],inclin(\[t2,moment-of-day,wednesday\](until Wednesday ofthis week) incl(\[tg,week,_\],\[n,_,_\])))Considering the examples we have just given, one may think that recursivityapplies only to the anchor.
This is not the case.
The triplet that gives the location timein the expression can be replaced by a complex expression.
We have such a situationwith le 3 avril dernier 'the last April 3rd' represented as:relpos ( -  1, inclin ( \[tlo?, day, 3\], \[tl, month, april\]), incl( \[t2, day, _\], \[n, _, _\]))More precisely, this expression means "the April 3rd that is the first one in thepast, taking speech time as starting point.
"Finally, to illustrate the richness of our semantics for expressing ATLs, in Table 2we give a list of more adverbials with their semantics.
Note the extensive use of thecombination property.Thus, to specify the localization of an occurrence, we can use another simultaneousobject, or use a localizer that is expressed in relation to another localizer.
The list ofrelations given in Table 1, together with the possibility of combining them, offers a verypowerful way of expressing the great diversity in the semantics of temporal localizers.Of course, not all the combinations may be expressed naturally in the language, butwe are convinced that most of the ATLs can be expressed with this semantics.
3The problem of representing temporal location has received a lot of attention inthe past (Dowty 1979, 1982, 1986; Bach 1986; Verkuyl 1989; and Vlach 1993).
But theseworks have focused on the aspectual structure of adverbials and their relation to tenseand aspect.
We have not found any previous proposals of a recursive semantics likeours for representing the various types of localizations.More related to our work is Allen (1983) who proposes a set of primitive relationsto represent all possible relations between two temporal intervals.
The relations definedin Table I differ in many respects from the relations proposed by Allen.
As mentionedbefore, ours are less precise.
For example, the moment represented using the relationend in our model corresponds to three relations in Allen's model.
Suppose that t* andtj* are the objective times corresponding to the localizer and the anchor, respectively.Then, in Allen's model, the end of t~ could coincide with the beginning of tj*, couldcoincide with the end of tj*, or could be included in t 7.The main reason for using a different set of primitives is to represent as closelyas possible the way temporal localization is dealt with in language.
The result of our3 In fact, the set of relations described here is not sufficient.
In Gagnon and Bras (1994), we define a morecomplete set of relations.105Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic TimeIt ENVIRONMENT.

!I!_ JPRETERI SEMANTICINTERFACEI-.~ ENGINE <?GRAMMARt (SystemicI t network)IIIi I t I t < --.... -*BLACKE I BOARDI RIFigure 8Implementation f the surface generation process in Prdtexte.To produce a sentence, the network is processed from left to right.
When a systemis entered, a choice is made that may lead to another system or to a conjunction ofsystems processed concurrently.
The syntactic structure of the phrase results from aset of constraints determined by features elected uring the traversal of the entirenetwork.The choices made in the first traversal of the network determine the overall struc-ture of the sentence, represented as an ordered sequence of functions that must befulfilled.
The term "function," in this context, refers to the role played by a con-stituent of a phrase in achieving a communicative goal (Halliday 1985).
For example,a sentence can often be decomposed into three constituents fulfilling the followingfunctions: Subject, Predicate, and Object.
4Once the functional structure of the sentence isestablished, its network is traversedagain to determine the syntactic structure, which is then further refined until eachfunction is realized by a single word.Figure 8 illustrates the organization of the modules in Pr6texte, inspired by Nigel(Mann 1983; Mann 1985; Matthiessen 1985; Matthiessen and Bateman 1991).
To producea sentence, Pr6texte uses three information components: the environment, containingthe information about the message and a knowledge base describing how to achievelexicalization; the grammar, represented as a systemic network; and the blackboard,used to determine the syntactic structure.
The engine controls the surface genera-tion process and accesses the three information components hrough three interfacemodules: semantic interface, interpreter and realizer.
The solver determines the fi-nal structure of the constituent, using constraints posted in the blackboard uring thetraversal of the network.4 In this text, names  of funct ions will a lways  be capital ized.107Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1Before starting the surface generation process, the environment is augmented withinformation that determines the message:?
a semantic structure such as the one illustrated in Figure 4;?
a set of relevant concepts, which are the elements of the conceptualrepresentation pertaining to the entities in the semantic structure;?
some pragmatic information, which specifies how to transmit themessage.The engine starts by posting on the blackboard the description of the realized con-st i tuent  representing the sentence.
It then activates the traversal of the network by theinterpreter.
To select a feature in a system, the interpreter t ansmits inquiries to theengine.
If the information ecessary to respond to the inquiry is in the environment,the engine transmits the inquiry to the semantic interface.
If an inquiry is about adecision previously made in the surface generation process (for example, a questionabout what features have been selected in a system visited earlier), then the enginetransmits the inquiry to the realizer.Answers to inquiries enable the selection of a feature in the visited system.
Theinterpreter then extracts a set of realization statements associated with the selectedfeature.
After the execution of these statements by the realizer, the information aboutthe structure of the realized constituent, contained in the blackboard, isupdated.
Threekinds of action may be executed by the realizer:?
addition of a new constituent with the appropriate semantic informationfulfilling a specific function;?
updating of the information pertaining to one constituent;?
addition of partial ordering constraints hat identify the sequence offunctions composing the final structure.This process goes on until no more system can be visited.
The solver then solvesthe ordering constraints on the blackboard.
We thus obtain a sequence of functionsthat constitutes the final structure of the realized constituent.
Each of these functionsis associated with semantic information extracted from the environment.
For example,the sentence may contain the function Temp_loc (temporal localizer), whose semanticinformation will be the expression associated with the temporal marker LOC in theinput.
If a function is to be lexicalized as a word, the lexicon is consulted to identifythe word, taking into account the features elected uring the traversal.
Otherwise thegrammar is re-entered using the function as the new realized constituent with somefeatures preselected.
For example, to generate the sentence in 2:(2) Jusqu'a 10h50, il a survol6 l'Alg6rie 'until 10:50, it flew over Algeria'the following semantic structure and relations are posted in the environment:message = event(olo)N=nR =09PERSP = nLOC = end(\[hl, _,_\], inclin(\[t6, minute, 50\], \[t4, hour, lO\]))(a) o10 < n(b) o10 C) tu108"Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic TimePositioner \[Jusque IA A /\Reference Zon 4 il \I 1h lOh50a survol4 l'Alg6rieFigure 9The structure of jusqu'd 10h50, il a survold l'Alg&ie.where o10 must be expressed as an event and tll is a period terminating at 10:50.
Theevent o10 is before the time of speech and it coincides more or less with the time usedas localizer.
The first traversal of the grammar determines the overall structure of thesentence made of the four functions at the top of Figure 9.
As none of them may belexicalized irectly as a word, they must be realized by re-entering the grammar.We describe only the realization of the function Tempdoc.
The semantics associ-ated with Temp_loc is the value of LOC in the semantic representation.
Traversal ofthe network for the realization of Temploc results in a structure with two functions:the Positioner and the Reference Zone.
The first function is lexicalized with the prepo-sition jusque; for the second function, the grammar is re-entered, taking as semanticsthe anchor of the expression associated with Tempdoc: inclin(\[t6,minute,50\], \[t4 hour, lO\]).Again, this results in a structure with two functions; in this case, both functions canbe lexicalized, ending the realization of the function Tempdoc.
The same kind of pro-cessing is done for the other functions in the sentence.5.
The Production of ATLsIn Section 3.3, we showed how the semantics of ATLs is represented; in this section, wepresent how ATLs can be lexicalized.
Table 3 gives a list of semantic representationsand their translations into ATLs produced by our generator.
As in Section 3.4, we usettoc for the temporal constant corresponding to the localizer of the occurrence, n forspeech time and tref for the reference time.5.1 Syntactic CompositionsSome ATLs (1-7, 16) are simple, while others (8-15, 17-18) contain an embedded tem-poral adverbial.
For example, in (11) jusqu'?l mercredi de cette semaine 'until Wednesdayof this week' contains another ATL, which itself contains another embedded ATL cettesemaine 'this week'.109Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1Table 3List of adverbial temporal locations.Semantics ATL(1) relpos(-1, \[tloc, day, _\], incl(\[t2, day, _\], \[n, _, _\]))(2) relpos(-1, \[hoc, daY,-\], incl(\[t2, day, _\], \[tref, _ _\]))(3) incl(\[tloc, day, _\], \[n, _, -\])(4) incl(\[tloc, month, _\], \[n, _, _\])(5) incl(\[tloc, month, _\], \[tref, - -\])(6) \[tloc,month,April\](7) \[01 ,-,-\](8) inclin(\[tloc,moment-of-day, morning\],inclin(\[t2,season,summer\],\[t3,year,1995\]))(9) inclin(\[ tloc,half-hour,1\],occurrence(ol ) )(10) duration(3,day)(11) end(\[tloc,_,_\],inclin(\[t2,day, wednesday\],incl(\[t3,week,_\],\[n,_,_\])))(12) begin(\[tloc,_,_\],relpos(1,\[t2,month,_\],incl (\[ t3,month,-\],\[ tref,-,-\]) ) )(13) begin(\[tloc,_,_\],inclin(\[t2,day, lO\],\[t3,month,may\]))(14) relpos(3,\[tloc,day,_\],occurrence(ol ))(15) after(\[tloc,day,_\],\[tref,_,_\],duration(3,day))(16) after(\[tloc,_,_\],\[tref _,_\],indefinite)(17) extent(\[tloc,_,_\],inclin(\[t2,day,3\],\[t3,month,april\]),inclin(\[t4,day, lO\],\[ts,month,may\]))(18) extent(\[tloc,_,_\],before(\[t2,-,-\],\[tre f ,-,-\],duration(3,day)),\[tre/,-,-l)hier (yesterday)la veille (the day before)aujourd'hui (today)ce mois-ci (this month)ce mois-la (that month)en avril (in April)quand Robert est parti (when Robert left)le matin du 3 avril 1995 (the morning of April3rd 1995)la premi6re demi-heure de l'6mission (thefirst half hour of the program)durant trois jours (during three days)jusqu'a mercredi de cette semaine (untilWednesday ofthis week)a partir du mois suivant (from the followingmonth)depuis le 10 mai (sinceMay lOth)trois jours apr6s le d6part de Robert (threedays after Robert's departure)trois jours plus tard (three days later)puis (then)du 3 avril au 10 mai (from April 3rd to MaylOth)depuis trois jours (since three days)Unfortunately, the combination of localizers in the semantics does not alwayscorrespond to the combination of adverbials.
For example, if there were such a corre-spondence, the adverbial in (1) would be something like lejour avant lejour qui contientl'instant d'~nonciation 'the day before the day that contains the time of speech'.
Instead,we get the simple adverbial hier 'yesterday'.
For complex semantic expressions, in allexamples except (15), (16) and (18), there is one embedded adverbial corresponding toeach anchor.
For example, the anchor relpos(1,\[t2,month,_\], incl(\[tB,month,_\], \[tref,-,-\])) in(12) corresponds to le mois suivant 'the following month' in the adverbial.
5 Examples(1-5) are special, since the relation and the anchor are combined in the same syntacticstructure.
In (15), direct translation of the anchor into an adverbial would producetrois jours apr~s ce mornent-l?l 'three days after that moment', and in (18), pendant roisjours jusqu'?~ ce moment-l?l 'during three days until that moment'.Since there is not always a direct correspondence b tween semantic and syntactic5 Note that in the adverbial, du is a contraction of de le.110Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic TimeQTY" ANCHORSI uniquedouble (Figure 10Section of Pr4texte's grammar for adverbials.ANCHORANCHORIANCIIOR2deictic~ anaphoricautonomous~ - deictic anaphoricautonomousi deicticanaphoricautonomousforms, which one should be used in the grammar to distinguish among ATLs?
Wehave chosen the semantic form because adverbials are distinguished not only by thenumber of anchors but also by their nature.
Examples (4) and (5) are both syntacticallysimple---the anchor in the semantic form is not expressed--but it is the anchor thatexplains their difference: the first uses speech time, whereas the second uses referencetime.Figure 10 illustrates the part of the network taking into account he combinationproperty.
We first identify the number of anchors.
If there is only one, the feature uniqueis selected in the system QTY_ANCHORS.
Otherwise, double is selected.
Then, for eachanchor, we must establish if it is deictic, anaphoric, or autonomous.
If the localizationrepresented by the anchor is made in relation to the time of speech, deictic is selected;if the localization is made in relation to the reference time, anaphoric is selected; ifthe anchor achieves a localization without using either of the two temporal markers,autonomous i selected.
In Table 4, we indicate the features elected in the systems ofFigure 10, for the production of the adverbials given in Table 3.Some adverbials may be distinguished using the systems of Figure 10, but Table 4shows that these systems are not enough.
The features have a strong influence on themost embedded adverbials.
For example, in (11), the selection of deictic results in cettesemaine 'this week' for the most embedded adverbial but if the feature anaphoric hadbeen selected, it would have produced cette semaine-lit ' hat week'.These features alone do not explain the recursive form of adverbials.
Figure 11shows the structure of two adverbials from Table 3.
The structure of adverbial (11) isgiven in (a).
It has three levels, each one corresponding to one adverbial.
The simplestructure of adverbial (4) is shown in (b).
Their difference isnot only due to the numberof levels in the structure.
In (a), the structure contains a function, the Positioner, thatexpresses the relation to the anchor; there is no function in (b).
Sometimes an anchoris not realized syntactically at all.
In Figure 12, we consider (13) and (15): the anchoris expressed in (13), shown in (a), but not in (15), shown in (b).
The structure of (15)contains the Positioner and a function conveying the temporal distance to an implicitanchor.These examples how that features are not sufficient; to determine the syntacticstructure of the adverbial, we need more systems in our grammar, such as the networkof Figure 7.
The two networks of Figure 7 and Figure 10 must be traversed in parallel.The system ZONE_DESIGNATION first distinguishes between adverbials that ex-111Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1Table 4Distinction of adverbials using the anchor.

Thus, (14) contains both functions and(15) contains only the Temporal Distance.
Adverbial (16) is distinguished from (14)and (15) because it contains neither of these functions.In dans trois jours 'in three days from now' and apr~s le 9 octobre 'after October 9th',we find two different structures.
The elements of the first structure are exactly thesame as the structure of adverbial (15), but they occur in a different order: TemporalDistance comes before the Positioner.
In the second structure, there is a TemporalReference Zone, le 9 octobre, but no Temporal Distance.
Thus, for punctual adverbials,there are five possible structures, illustrated in Figure 12.
To distinguish between theseadverbials, we use a network, part of which is shown in Figure 13.Two features are expressed by the system RELATION TYPE: before and after.
Torealize the Positioner, there is no need to re-enter the grammar, since it may be founddirectly in the lexicon.
The lexical choice depends not only on the selection achieved114Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic TimeTable 6List of punctual adverbials.Adverbial RELATION REFERENCE TEMPORALTYPE ZONE DISTANCE(14) trois jours apr6s le d6part de Robert after explicit definite(three days after Robert's departure)apr6s le 9 octobre (after October 9th) after explicit indefinite(15) trois jours plus tard (three days later) after implicit definitedans trois jours (three days from now) after implicit definite(16) puis (then) after implicit indefinitetrois jours avant le d6part de Robert before explicit definite(three days before Robert's departure)avant 8h00 (before 8:00) before explicit indefinitetrois jours avant (three days earlier) before implicit definiteil y a trois jours(three days ago) before implicit definiteauparavant (before) before implicit indefinitein RELATION TYPE, but also in the choice made in the system ANCHOR of figure 10.For example, in the cases where after is chosen, the Positioner could be lexicalized aspuis 'then' or plus tard 'later'; if anaphoric is chosen in ANCHOR it can be lexicalizedas dans 'in' if deictic is chosen or apr~s 'after' if autonomous i chosen.The fact that Temporal Distance and Temporal Reference Zone are optional in thestructure is represented in the grammar by two parallel systems: REFERENCE ZONEand TEMPORAL DISTANCE.
If, in REFERENCE ZONE, explicit is chosen, the functionTemporal Reference Zone is included in the structure.
Since this function representsanother localizer, the anchor, it is realized by re-entering the grammar, taking as inputthe semantic representation f this anchor.
In TEMPORAL DISTANCE, the selectionof definite results in the inclusion of the function Temporal Distance.
To realize it,the grammar must be re-entered, and some features must be preselected so that it isrealized as a noun phrase.Table 6 lists all possible adverbials represented by the network of Figure 13 to-gether with their selected features.
The three adverbials taken from Table 3 are pre-ceded by their reference number to ease the comparison of their semantics with theselected features; their relations will be discussed later.The distinction between structures (b) and (c) in Figure 12 is not explained bythe grammar section shown in Figure 13, since the same features are selected for troisjours plus tard and dans trois jours.
However, structure (b) in Figure 12 is found onlyfor deictic localizers.
Therefore, features for deictic localizers selected in the systemANCHOR, will distinguish structure (b) from structure (c).Let us now see how the features are selected for the production of relationalpunctual ocalizers.
In RELATION TYPE, the feature reflects the relation used in thesemantics, if this relation is before or after.
Adverbial (14) deserves ome explanation.Since its semantic expression uses the relation relpos, we would expect its syntacticrealization to be: le troisi~me jour apr~s le jour du d6part de Robert 'the third day after theday of Robert's departure', but this usage is rare.
Instead we find trois jours apr~s led6part de Robert 'three days after Robert's departure', which is what we would expect ifthe semantic expression used the relation after.
This seems to be because if the temporaldistance is one unit, a direct localizer is preferred.
So, instead of generating un moisplus tard 'one month later', we produce le mois suivant 'the next month'.

More study is needed to determinethe threshold at which the two relations become quivalent in the linguistic realization.We are sure that for X = I or X = -1,  they are not equivalent, so in our implementation,we use 2 and -2  as thresholds.In the system REFERENCE ZONE, the feature implicit is chosen if the anchor isa simple localizer using the reference time or the time of speech, otherwise xplicit ischosen.
Feature selection in TEMPORAL DISTANCE depends on whether the thirdargument in the semantic expression is indefinite or a specified duration.5.2.2 Durative Adverbials.
We now show how the durative adverbials of Table 5 canbe differentiated.
The part of the network that generates these adverbials is shownin Figure 14.
We give the three kinds of structure identified for these adverbials inFigure 15, and, finally, in Table 7 we list the durative adverbials of Table 5 with theircorresponding features according to the systems of Figure 14.
To give a completeillustration of all adverbials generated with the network of Figure 14, we added oneadverbial to the list: pendant trois jours 'for three days from now', which is symmetricalto depuis trois jours 'for three days until now'.In Figure 14, we distinguish two types of durative adverbial phrases: bound, ifthe duration is expressed by specifying one or two of its boundaries; and quantified,116Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic TimeTab le  7List of durative adverbials.Adverbial DUR.

- -  - -  nilif the duration is expressed as a quantity of time units.
In the first case, we get astructure such as (b) or (c) in Figure 15.
In (b) there is only one boundary, and thePositioner indicates which one is used: its lexicalization depends on the feature selectedin DURATION ANCHOR.
If anterior is selected, one further distinction is required tolexicalize the Positioner, as represented by the system DURATION PERSPECTIVE.
ThePositioner is realized by the phrase ~ partir de if the feature chosen is external, otherwiseit is realized as depuis.
The choice depends on the aspect of the occurrence reported:the feature external is chosen if the occurrence is presented as an event, and internal ischosen if the occurrence is presented as a situation.
These two cases are exemplifiedin the following two sentences:(3) a.
A partir de 1972, il enseigna l'Universit6 de Montr6al.
'From 1972on, he taught at Universit6 de Montr6al'.b.
Depuis 1972, il enseignait a l'Universit6 de Montr6al.
'Since 1972 hewas teaching at Universit6 de Montr6al'.In (3a), since the occurrence is presented as an event, the feature external is selectedduring the determination of the ATL, thus resulting in the form ~ partir de 1972 ' from1972'.
In (3b), the same occurrence is presented as a situation considered from thereference time.
Thus, internal is selected, resulting in the form depuis 1972 'since 1972'.This is a good example of the interaction of ATLs with the aspect of the occurrence.In the interpretation of the ATL in (3b), the duration is anchored not only onthe year 1972 but also on the reference time included in the occurrence.
But in thesemantics of the ATL, which uses the relation begin, as well as ATL (12) in Table 3,there is only one anchor.
Even if the reference time is involved in the understandingof the whole sentence, it is not directly expressed in the semantics of the ATL.An alternative would be to express the same localization using the relation extent,as in (18) of Table 3.
If the reference time is included in 1982 (the beginning of theduration expressed in (3b) thus being 10 years before), the semantics would be:extent(\[hoc,_,_\],before(\[tl,year, d,\[t2,_,-\],duration(lO,year)),incl(\[ta,year, d,\[tref ,_,_\]))117Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1In depuis dix ans 'For 10 years', the meaning of the ATL, which is "since 10 yearsin the past starting from this moment" requires the use of the reference time.If, in the system DURATION ANCHOR, the feature double is chosen, we get astructure containing two boundaries, as in (c) in Figure 15.
A boundary, in the structureof a bound localizer, is always realized as a temporal adverbial, by re-entering thegrammar.When the feature quantified is selected, the structure in (a) of Figure 15 is obtained.To realize the Positioner in this case, another system is required, because the quantityof time that constitutes the duration can be worded in many ways.
We can expressthe duration of the occurrence without giving any hint about its location in time, asin durant trois jours 'during three days', or we can indicate a duration that begins orends at some time.To see how the features are selected in the grammar section of Figure 14, comparethe adverbials of Table 7 with their semantics as given in Table 3 (the semantics forpendant rois jours is the same as depuis trois jours, but the relation after is substitutedbefore and the two anchors are reversed).
First, the feature bound in DURATION TYPEis selected if the relation used in the semantic representation is either begin or end, orif it is extent and the two anchors are autonomous.
In DURATION ANCHOR, featurescorresponding to these three cases are selected.
In DURATION PERSPECTIVE, theselection depends on the aspect of the occurrence reported in the sentence.In DURATION TYPE, quantified is selected if the semantics uses the relation extentand one anchor is deictic or anaphoric, as in our examples, or if it uses the relationduration.
In the first case, the selection depends on the position of the anaphoric ordeictic anchor in the expression.
If the relation duration is used, since there is no anchor,the feature nil is selected in the next system.5.3 Direct LocalizersWe complete our discussion of adverbials by explaining how the direct localizers can bedifferentiated.
Figure 16 shows the structure of the direct adverbials that constitute thefirst half of Table 5; there are three possible structures for a direct localizer.
The simplestones, in (a) and (b), contain only one function, Zone Designator, that expresses thetemporal location zone designated by the adverbial.
This function is realized directlyby an adverb, in (a), using the lexicon depending on the system ANCHOR of Figure 10.In (b), the grammar must be re-entered to generate a nominal phrase whose form alsodepends on the choice in ANCHOR.In some cases, it is not sufficient to specify a temporal location zone: we must alsoadd what we call a Pointer to relate the occurrence with this zone.
In our examples,the Pointer indicates that the occurrence takes place during the month of April, or whenRobert left.
The existence of such a localizer in the structure seems to depend on thelevel of the adverbial in the embedding structure.
For example, we find a Pointer inthe adverbial ~ ShOO 'at 8:00' if it is used alone, but not if it is embedded in anotheradverbial, ike depuis 8hO0 'since 8:00'.
Our approach to this problem may be contrastedwith Forster's (1989), who determines the realization of the Pointer by the temporalaspect of the Zone Designator (durative or punctual) using a constraint propagationtechnique.Other possible structures for direct localizers are illustrated in (d) and (e) in Fig-ure 16.
One function is the Zone Designator, which designates the direct expressionof temporal zone.
If this zone is included in another localizer or in a position relativeto another localizer, we must include another function in the structure: the ReferenceZone, which corresponds to this second localizer.
The Attributor links these two func-tions.

This morning is itself part of another localizer, and so on.
The Attributoris sometimes lexicalized as an empty item.To these direct localizers, we must add the embedded irect adverbials foundin the relational adverbials of table 5.
In Figure 17, we use by dashed-line boxes toindicate those that differ from Figure 16.The system shown in Figure 18 differentiates among these different forms of directadverbials.
For occurrential dverbials, for example, the second adverbial of (b) inFigure 16 and the embedded adverbials in (d) in Figure 16 and (b) in Figure 17, theoccurrence may be nominalized or not.
We do not have any satisfying answers to thequestion of how to choose between these two possibilities.
We will state only thatwhen the adverbial is embedded, a nominalized form may be preferred to anotherembedded adverbial.For chronological dverbials, the system AUTONOMOUS ZONE distinguishesbetween those that have an anaphoric or deictic temporal location zone, and those forwhich the temporal location zone is autonomous.
Adverbials of the first type alwayshave a simple structure: aujourd'hui, hier, demain, ce mois-ci, ce mois-lh, cette semaine, lemois suivant.
The temporal location zone is different from the anchor.
In mercredi de cettesemaine "Wednesday of this week', the temporal location zone, expressed by mercredi,is autonomous whereas the anchor expressed by cette semaine is deictic.
When thenetwork is traversed the first time, yes is selected in the system AUTONOMOUSZONE.
Its only in the second traversal, when cette semaine is generated, that no isselected in this system.We must further distinguish adverbials with an autonomous temporal locationzone, by deciding if their structure contains a Reference Zone or not.

The systems in Figure 19 do not suffice to distinguish all directadverbials.
The selections in these systems must be combined with the selections madein the systems of Figure 10.5.4 Related Work on the Generation of ATLsThe problem of temporal localization has already been studied by many researchers,but most of them have focused on the aspectual interaction of the adverbials withverb tense; the problem of the semantic and syntactic structures of ATLs has beenneglected.
Molin6s' (1990) study from a linguistic perspective characterizes the ad-verbials based on noun phrases.
Our work extends hers because our computationalperspective has made us go farther in the formalization.
Bras and Molin6s (1993)made a similar attempt, but from the perspective of discourse understanding.
Sincethe problems of understanding are very different from the problems of generation, wecould not simply use their method in a "reversed mode."
Their method relies on acompositional nalysis of the language, where all information units extracted from thesemantic structure are combined to select one meaning for the adverbial.
This compo-sitional approach is not easily reversible, and it does not provide any insight into theselection problem inherent o the generation task.
Ehrich (1987) classifies adverbials inthe context of generation, but she does not cover all the cases presented in this section.Concerning the problem of the generation of ATLs, Maybury (1991) shows how thenotion of focus as used by McKeown (1985) can be extended to include a temporalfocus that corresponds essentially to the reference point in the Reichenbach model(1947).
An operation on the temporal focus, in combination with the value of speechand event imes, selects the temporal adverbial and the verb tense.
Since the emphasisin this work was on the planning aspect of the task, the variety of adverbials that canbe generated is limited.Forster (1989) explains how the syntactic structure of a temporal adverbial may becontrolled by semantic information such as the durative or punctual nature of the lo-calizer.
Essential134 the final structure is obtained by propagating constraints associatedwith each syntactic subpart of the structure.
In particular, he focuses on the interactionbetween prepositional phrases and noun phrases.
For example, the preposition on is121Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1selected in on Sunday because Sunday is identified as a punctual localizer; this rules outin, which implies a durative localizer.
We have already presented one problem withthis approach: it is not clear how the choice of these prepositions can be achieved bypropagating semantic onstraints.
The choice of preposition in French is very differentfrom English and it often appears to be arbitrary or conventional.
Furthermore, manyaspects of the problem are neglected, such as the type of reference xpressed by theadverbial: it is not clear how Forster's ystem can represent the distinctions betweenanaphoric, deictic and autonomous localizers because the link between the semanticand syntactic levels is not fully explained.Nigel (Matthiessen and Bateman 1991) offers the widest coverage of English butthe variety of forms for ATLs is quite limited.
The temporal localization that may beexpressed by different ypes of syntactic structures i represented in Nigel by systemsdispersed throughout the whole grammar network.
For the expression of temporallocalizers, their grammar is more dependent on the syntactic structure than ours,which is mainly determined by the semantics.To summarize, our approach departs from previous approaches by covering moretypes of adverbials, by proposing a semantics for localization, and by explaining indetail how the different syntactic structures may be obtained from this semantics.6.
The Production of Verb PhrasesIn our work, we have focused on the generation of adverbials because we felt thisproblem had not received enough attention and because the temporal ocalizationachieved by ATLs is more complex and more diversified than that expressed by verbtenses.
To generate a discourse like Discourse 1, however, we cannot avoid the problemof determining the structure of the verb phrase, because part of the localization isachieved by the verb, and because of the relations between verbs and adverbials.In our implemention of the expression of temporal localization, the relation be-tween the verb and the adverbial is taken into account mainly in the deep generationprocess.
In the semantic representation, we find traces of this interaction.
By keepingthese decisions in the deep generation process, the verb phrase and the ATL can begenerated independently.Our method for generating the verb phrase takes advantage of the kind of in-formation directly represented in DRT: the relation of the occurrence to speech time,which we call the primary localization, the aspect of the occurrence, and the presenceor absence of a perspective point.
It is implemented by the grammar section illustratedin Figure 19.
In Prdtexte, the production of verb phrases requires many traversals ofthe network.
First, when the structure of the sentence is determined, choices are maderegarding localization, aspect, and perspective.
After a first traversal of the network,the sentence's structure contains a function called Predicate, realized as a verb phrase.The grammar must be re-entered to realize the Predicate.
The systems visited duringthis second traversal (not shown here) classify verb tenses in French.
Most of the se-lections during this second traversal were preselected uring the first traversal.
Foreach verb tense, there is one associated structure, which contains a main verb and oneor two auxiliaries.
To generate ach verb or auxiliary, another traversal is needed.In the first system of Figure 19, PRIMARY LOC, the selection depends on thetemporal relation between the localized occurrence and the speech time.
The featuresof the systems ASPECT and SIT TYPE reflect he value of aspect in the semantic rep-resentation.
If the aspect is event, the system PERSPECTIVE determines if this event ispresented using a perspective.
If there is one, another choice must be made regardingits type.122Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic Time,---- past/ I '~YL~ ~ presentsituationASI~CTevent ~RS~CTIVEE resultirlgopenI.Figure 20Generation of verb phrase--sentence l vel.perspectiveno perspectivePERSPECTIVfi a n teri orityTYPEposteriorityTable 9Production of VP--examples.Selections during first traversal Tense selected during Examplesecond traversalpast - situation - resultingpast - situation - openpast - event - perspective - anterioritypast event perspectiveposterioritypast - event - no perspectiveplus-que-parfaitpass4 ant6rieurimparfaitimparfaitconditionnelplus-que-parfaitpass6 compos6A 8h00, il avait terrain4.

(Robert alked to Marie).Table 9 shows examples of verb phrases, including the list of features selectedfor each example during the two traversals.
The same tense can be used for differentfeature patterns.
This is the case with the imparfait and the plus-que-parfait: he impar-fait expresses an open situation or an anterior perspective, while the plus-que-parfaitpresents a resulting situation or a posterior perspective.
This may be a problem inan understanding process, since it is a source of ambiguity, but not in a generationprocess since it does not matter if two different inputs map into the same syntacticstructure.More than one verb tense may be used for the same features.
This means thatour grammar is not complete: more systems would be needed to distinguish amongthese different cases.
For example, to distinguish the two tenses used with the firstfeature pattern of Table 9, we would have to augment the grammar section of Figure 19123Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 1to determine if the verb phrase is part of a temporal adverbial or not.
For the twocases in the third feature pattern, the difference relates to the use of indirect discourse.Here, not only would the grammar have to be modified, but so would the semanticrepresentation, to take into account indirect speech.
In Discourse 1, this problem is notapparent: all verb tenses used are distinguished in our grammar because we limitedourselves to a subset of the data.Thus, the production of VP is more complex than what we have implemented andwe have not completely identified all the rules for the selection of verb tense: indirectdiscourse is not implemented and we have not identified how modal information canbe used to select forms such as the subjunctive and the conditional.
But our approachis a good start and it could be extended by adding more systems and their selectionrules, without changing the overall structure of the network.We can see from the approximate translations given in Table 9 that the systemsfor generating French and English verb tenses differ greatly.
For English verb tenses,the method implemented in Nigel resorts to a recursive semantics involving temporalmarkers, as proposed by Halliday (Matthiessen and Bateman 1991).
The purpose inthis approach is to deal correctly with complex structures, uch as will have been eating.Put simply, the idea is that each auxiliary reflects a relation between two temporalmarkers.
This suggests a network that displays a recursive process.
Thus, the phrasewill have been going to eat would be represented semantically as to eat at a time that is inthe future relative to another time that is in the past relative to a time that is in the future relativeto speech time.This method may be adequate for English, since it seems to capture the recursivestructure of verb tenses; but in French, this recursive structure is not found.
Fur-thermore, nothing is said about how a deep generation process could produce thecorresponding semantic structure with the intermediate t mporal markers.
In fact, weare not convinced that this could be easily done.
Rather, we think that it is the overallstructure that is selected for a particular usage.This completes our brief description of the generation of verb tenses.
We havenot completely solved the problem.
In particular, we have chosen to put most of theproblems pertaining to verb tense in the deep generation process, in order to facilitatetheir generation at the surface level.
This approach greatly simplifies the process andour grammar could be easily completed to encompass all cases.
Once the semanticdemands are better understood, it should be easier to solve the problem of deepgeneration.7.
Conc lus ion and Future WorkIn this paper, we have presented a method that has been successfully used to producetext conveying temporal information.
Our method combines the principles of twotheories: Kamp's Discourse Representation Theory, which guides the expression oftemporal information, and Halliday's Systemic Functional Grammar, which providesa generation process controlled by a set of semantic hoices, with the syntactic formresulting from these choices.
We argued for the use of a conceptual structure, a Dis-course Representation Structure, combined with rhetorical principles and pragmaticinformation, and for its translation into a semantic structure that is easily realized syn-tactically.
The deep generation process is hard to implement, mainly because of thedifficulty in formalizing this information.
Since we assume that the deep generation124Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic TimeRelations and Commonsense Entailment.Linguistics and Philosophy, 16: 437-493.Mann, W. (1983).
