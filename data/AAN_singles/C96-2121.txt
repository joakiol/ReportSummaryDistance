(12", .)
is the monoid over 12 where .
denotesconcatenation.
1)* is also the infinite union of all12n tbr n 6 IN.
By convention, 120 = {el with gbeing the empty string.Using these notations, analogies are equationswith one unknown on 12': u:v  = w:x .
Tobeable to solve analogies, it is necessary to give ameaning to such a notation.3.2 A geometr i ca l  viewIn our attempt o discover a mathematical expla-nation of analogy, we were long hindered by thenotation itself.
Of course, the idea behind it isthat analogy could be considered a similar psy-chological process as the one intervening in pro-portions:mathematics:mathematical = physics : x2:4  = 3 :xBut ~, the set of rationals, is mathematicallywell equipped.
Addition defines a commutativegroup, and multiplication makes it a field.
Pro-portions in iI~ are thus well understood, and safelysolved.
What is true for II~ is not for l;*.
The basicoperation, concatenation, is not comnmtative anddoes not define a group, but a relaxed structure,that of a monoid.
And no one knows what themeaning of u : v could possibly be.In fact, looking at analogy fi'om the previouspoint of view is misleading because, intentionallyor not, we think of nmnbers, which enforces toomany constraints.
A better, more relaxed viewof the problem is that e ra  rectangle.
In a rect-angle, opposite sides and diagonals are equal (seeFigure 1).rnathemO, tics physicsmathematical ~ xFigure 1: Analogy seen as a rectangle3.3 Formal | sa t |on'Fhis view makes explicit that analogy sets a rela-tion between an unknown on on(" hand, and threeterms on the oth& hand.
Now, carrying on withthe geometrical paralM, analogy may be inter-preted in terms of distances as follows : the distanee of any term to the unknown is the sameas the distance between the two remaining terms.We thus posit the following equivalence.Def in i t ion  1 (Ana logy)A f dist(u,v) = dist(w,x)u:  v -- w:  x ~=> dist(u,w) = dist(v,x)dist(v,w) = dist(u,x)The rectangle view does not forbid commutativ-ity for dist, a notable difference with division onnumbers, where 2/4 is not the same as 4/2.3.3.1 L inguist ic  i n te rpretat ionLet us linguistically interpret he previous sys-tem of equations.
Supl)ose we get the followinganalogy to solve: mathematics: mathematical =physics : x.
Of course, x = physical.The first two equations show that the termson the diagonal may be exchanged.
A linguis-tic interpretation is thai; analogy involves twoorthogonal dimensions reflecting the duality ofthe lexeme/morpheme (or root/affix, or mean-ing/limction, etc.)
separation.
(list(mathematics, mathematical) =dist(physics, physical)dist( mathematics, physics) =dist(mathematical, physical)On each side of the equal sign something is con-served (one dimension), and something changes(second dimension).
* In the example, the first equation stands fora conservation i  meaning ( "mathemat ics"as opposed to "physics")  and a change incategories,.
whereas the second equation stands for a con-servation of grammatical categories (N as op-posed to A), but a change in meanings.The third equation means that, somehow, anal-ogy neutralises changes performed at the sametime along the two previous dimensions.dist( mathematics, physical) =dis.t(physics, mathematical)On each side of the equality sign, both changes inmeanings and categories, performed at the sametime, leave the proportion unchanged.3.3.2 Con lp le te  tbrmal i sa t ionIn order to complete the \['ormMisation, dist re--mains to be defined, l,;dition distances which havebeen proposed in many works (Levenshtein 65),(Wagner & Fischer 74), (Selkow 77), etc., are agood (;atl(lidate.
They are mathematically soundas well as fat , i t | rely relevant: they re\[tect a sensi-ble notion, that of keystrokes, an(t turn out to bemetrics under some hypotheses.
They answer thecorrection problem: what is the minimal numberof cdit operations needed to lransJbrm one wordinto anolhcr one?.
In our example, how mmtycharacters need to be (:hanged to transR)rm malh-emalical into physics'?
Edit operations are inser-tion (for instance, e -~ p), (leletion (like l -+  ?
)718and replacement (like a ---+ s).
A <listance can bedefined by assigning weights to these three ()per:ations, 1 for each of them, for simplification.
Theedit <tistance is then a simple extension fi'om editoperations to strings.Def in i t ion 2 (Ed i t ion d istanee)  Let V be avocab'ulary, dist is defined on V* as a commutat iveoperation, in the fol lowing way:v(a, c v v(,,,,O (v*)dist(e,e) = d is t (a ,a )=0dist(e,a) = dist(a,b) = 1 ff a : /bdist(a.u,c) = dist(a,e) + dist(u,e)dist(a, c) + dist(u, b.v),dist(a.u,b.
'v) = mi~4 dist(a,b) + dist(u,v), )dist(< b) + dist(a.
'u, v)With this delinition and a weight of 1 for eachof the three edit operations, tile distance betweenmathemat ica l  and physics becomes 9.m a t h c m a I i c a /yszcs= 9As a mathematical result, with more generalweighl;s, it can be proved that, if the edit Ol)er-ations define a metric on P U {c}, then the ('.
(litdistance on V* is also a metric.
We recall tiletbrmal definition of a metric.Def in i t ion 3 (Metr ic )  Let S bc a set, dist afunct ion f rom ,_q x S to IR + , the ,so/of non-negat ivereal n'umbcrs, dist is a metr ic  on S i f  and only i f?

( commula l iv i ty )v((,, s ( l ist(< b) = di t(< a)?
(h'iangle inequal ity) V(a, b, c) C S a,dist(a, c) _< dist(a, b) + dist(b, c)3.4  Coveragetlaving defined what we un<lerstand by analogyin a formal way, we inspect, some o\[' its proper-ties.
We first; make a very strong but necessaryassumption about the nature of the solution of ananalogy.
Following the linguistic feeling, we im-pose that tile solution of an analogy be built onlywith the elements of the vocabulary present in thethree given terms.
In other words, no materialfrom outside should be used.This constraint does not prevent analogies fromhaving multiple solutions.
It suffices that the dis-tances become too large relative to the lengths ofthe words, a: thc  = o f :x  is such a case.
Theconstraint eliminates, for instance, all words ofthe form txy, with x and y two letters outside ofthe set {a, e, f ,  h, o , t} ,  but does not bar Ill, hhh,eee, which are solutions of this analogy.
But, as amatter of fact, this kind of example does not makemuch linguistic sense.3.4 .1  Equa l i tyA degenerated c~se of analogy is when two oftile three terms are equal.
The only possihle solu-tion is then the third term.
IlL other words, noth-ing new <:an really be said.
This meets commonse l l se .v) c (v ' f ,  = =This property is always true.
It is proved thanksto the equality property of a metric: u : "u = v : xd is t (u , ,4=O=dis t (v ,x )  ~ x=, : .Some.
imt>ortmtt linguistic phenomena re cov-ered hy onr proposal for linguistic examples.
Butthe corresponding mathematical properties ap-pear not to hold ill the general case.
In fact, study-ing the necessary and suificient conditions underwhich they are true remains an open problem.
Itseems that, in all cases, it; has to do with some"weakest links" along the pair of strings consid-ered (minimisation of a sum of distances).3.4 .2  Trans i t iv i tyAn important property which works in manycases, and at least on linguistic examples, but maynot; be true in the general case 6, is transitivity:?t l V -~  l f f  : V I A ~ttl l ?
)l ~-  lJO : X zT~ I / \ [V  : 'W :XThis accounts for the fact; that any representativeill a group of con jugat ion/dec lens ion/d ie ,  may hechosen as the model.
In Ancient Greek, AoTo< isalways taken as a model for the declension of tile1st group of masculine nouns, although any otherword from the same group would have been asgood.3.4 .3  Pref ixes and suffixesOur definition of analogy fortunately captureslinguistic cases where prefixes (or suffixes) are in-volved.t t .

X ~ W.~This is not true in tile general case.
At least;,x = w.v ahvays verilles tile first two distance qua-tions:{ dist('u.t,u.v) = dist(l,v)= dist(w.t, w.v)= dist(l,v)d is t (u .

~ the : tit = the : hhh becausedist(the, thc) = 0 ?
dist(ttt, hhh) = 3719dist(u.v, u.w)  = dist(v, w).
But the third equationmay not always be verified.
A suIficient conditionfor it to hold is that the joints between prefixesand suffixes minimise some sums of distances:dist(u.v,w.t) = dist(u,w) + dist(t,v)= dist(u.t, w.v)This is the case when prefixes and sulfixes are dis-similar enough, as in our example with mathema#i-cs and phys-i-cal,  but in the general case, onlydist(u.v, w.t) _< dist(u, w) + dist(v, t) holds.3.4.4 Inf ixes and  umlautsSimilarly to prefixing and suffixing, our for-malisation accounts for linguistic examples of in-fixing, a phenomenon well illustrated by semiticlanguages 7 (here, the replacement of an a by ani).Arabic: arsala : mursi lun = aslama : xx = mus l imunIt also accounts for some (not all) examples ofsound changes, like umlaut in German s .German: Balg : B~lge = Ilals : xx = HiilseThese linguistic cases work partly thanks to theprevious property of distances with prefixes.3.4.5 R.edupl ieat lonUnfortunately, our proposal does not render anaccount of reduplication.
This would be necessaryif we wanted to describe, for example, the for-mation of plurals in Malay/Indonesian: orang ---+orang-orang 9.
Here, a speculative remark wouldlink the power of analogy with some class of lan-guages; our proposal seems not to go beyond reg-ular languages.4 Appl icationIn the sequel, we will apply the principle of anal-ogy not on words anymore, but on sentences.
Inthe same way ~ words are strings of characters,sentences are strings of words.
So, the shift fromwords to sentences i just of matter of reformula-tion.Wc also recall that edit distances and edit op-erations are not contined to strings; they extendin a natural way to forests, and hence to trees.In fact, it is possible to give a definition of anedit distance on forests which generalises the def-initions on strings (Wagner & Fischer 74) and on7arsala (he sent) and aslama (he became con-verted) verbs 3rd person singular past; mursilun (asender) and muslirnun (a convert) agent nouns.8Balg (pelt, skin) and Iials (neck) singular; Biilgeand Hdlse plural.9 orang (human being) singular, orang-orang plural.trees (Selkow 77).
Hence the possibility of apply-ing analogy to trees.The example-based approach in machine trans-lation, inaugurated by (Nagao 84) and illustratedby (Sadler and Vendelmans 90) or (Sato 90), forinstance, relies on the assumption that, if two sen-tences are "ek)se", then, their analyses hould be"close" too.
By consequence, if the analysis of afirst sentence is known, the analysis of the secondone could be obtained by performing slight "mod-ifications" (>it it.
A problem arises: where are theslight "modifications" to be performed, and what;are they?
In that matter, edit distances could helpa lot: "close" means at a distance not too large,and ':modifications" are edit operations.4.1 Analysis by analogy4.1.1 Pr inc ip leSuppose we have a collection of sentences (adata-base) already analysed (in fact, a tree-bank).For a new sentence, called the prototype, our goalis to build its analysis, i.e., a corresponding tree.Of course, the ideal case is when the prototypeis already present in the tree-bank, which meansthat the analysis is tbnnd there too.In general, the prototype will not be found inthe tree-bank.
The search may thus be relaxed tosimilar sentences.
Now, if at least two differentsentences are retrieved by approximate matching,a fourth one can be built by analogy.
Figure 2illustrates this: the prototype is in the upper leftcorner; the two sentences on its right and underit have been obtained by approximate matching.Knowing the respective distances between thesethree sentences (on the arrows), sentence x can becomputed by analogy.it' by chance sentence x belongs to the tree-bank,its analysis is also in the tree-bank.
Now, a reverseprocess on trees delivers an analysis for the proto-type, as illustrated in Figure 3.
The three trees inthe right and bottom corners are the correspond-ing analyses of the sentences of Figure 2.
Theywere taken from the tree-bank.
The distances aregiven on the arrows.
Tree y is the solution of theanalogy, and we claim that it is the analysis of theprototype sentence.4.1.2 Imp lementat ionApproximate matching is retrieval of all sen-tences at a distance less than a threshold Kom agiven prototype.
Efficient algorithms, using dy-namic programming, have been proposed to per-tbrm approximate matching (Ukkonen 83) and(Landau & Vishkin 88).
Our method is some-what different.
We do as if we wanted to gener-ate the entire set of sentences at a distance lessthan or equal to the threshold.
In doing that,we introduce a don't care symbol representing anypossible word.
Pattern-matching with don't caresymbols has already been studied (Pinter 85).

Only sentences which a.re substringsof other strings may be coded.
This allows us touse a siml)le non-determinist|(- version of the Aho& (;orasick algorithm (Aho &.

This algorithm C()tl.tl)CteSwell with one of the n,ost elIichmt algorithm agrcp(Wu ~ Manl)er 92), as it is faster in average.4.1 .3  Us(; ant i  us ( ; fu lnessIn a first implementation, rather than reallycomputing solutions of analogies on trees, we re-trieve them from the tree-bank using approximatematching.
I,;xeeution dines are l)eh)w one secondfor the analysis of short chunks of text (about 5words).
This technique helps a lot in the (-onstruc-lion of tree-banks.
Firstly, building new linguis-tic structures for new sentences i delinitely madefaster.
Secondly, this technique enforces consis--tency, a sensible issue in tree-bank construction,especially if tree-banks are to be used to trainprobabilistic models.4.1 .4  Ex i )e rhnents  and  measures' lb have a more precise idea about the powerof the method, we carried out some experimentson an excerpt of the tree.-bank of the Universityof Pennsylwmin (787 sentences with their corresponding analyse's).
For all possible zl-tuples ofSellt,(\]i i lees which verify the analogy definition, wceomlmted the analysis of the first sentence byanalogy.
We.
recall that there may be no solution,one solution, or several solutions..As a restrict, ionin this experiment, we (lid not consider distancesbetween objects over half of the lengths of the ob-jects.Ret:all  In document retrieval, recall is delinedas the ratio of the number of relevant documentsretrieved over the total mmlber of relewmt docu--inents ill the data base.
Ih're, we (lefine the recallas the number of times the exact structure wascomputed by analogy, divided by the number ofsentence t)airs having the same structure in thetree-bank.
In one experiment, he recall is 0.69, aquite good figure, which shows thai; the techniqueis promising.P rec is ion  Again, in document retriewfl, preci-sion is defined as the ratio of the nmnt)er of rele-721rant documents retrieved over the total number ofdocuments retrieved.
Here, we define the precisio~as the number of times when the exact structurewas computed by analogy divided by the numberof solutions delivered.In the experiment, he precision is 0.43, whichmeans thai in almost half of the cases, one of thestructures delivered is the right one.
Now, in aver-age, the structures delivered are far from the exactstructure by 1.61 node, with a standard eviationof 1.86.
This means that in average less that twonodes have to be edited in order to get the exactstructm:e, the size of a structure in the tree-bankbeing 9.8 :t: 5.4 nodes.4.2 Generat ion  by ana logyGeneration may be performed in the same way asanalysis, the difference being that the prototypeis a tree and pattern-matching is performed ontrees.
The overall process is similar to the one foranalysis, but in the opposite direction.
The toolwe have built for the edition of text with trees,allows approximate matching on trees, and gener-ation is performed using the same functions as foranalysis.5 Conc lus ionWe have proposed a possible theoretical explana-tion of analogy in terms of edit distances.
Asexpected, this proposal renders an account ofsome important linguistic phenomena, in partic-ular, prefixing, suffixing and infixing.
Also, tran-sitivity is verified by linguistic examples.
Never-theless, the exact mathematical properties, andespecially, the necessary and sufficient conditionson strings under which the above mentioned prop-erties hold remain for the large part to be studied.A possible application is anMysis and genera-tion by analogy.
The proposed technique falls un-der the example-based approaches to natural an-guage processing, hut we think it may be saferthan previous methods, because it relies on moreinformation, and linguistically founded informa-tion.
We have built a first implementation, whichshows to be of great utility in accelerating the con-struction of tree-banks and improving their con-sistency.ReferencesAlfred V. Aho and Margaret J. CorasickEfficient String Matching: An Aid to Biblio-graphic SearchCommunications of the ACM, Vol.
