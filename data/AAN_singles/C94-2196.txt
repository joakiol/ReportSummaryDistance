If B is a 'helpful' agent(llOllaHl.Ol)Ol/lOtlS), B will accepl A's proposal withoul awammt.
Altemalively, if B deliberates whether to accept1; but B knows of no competing options, Ihen P will bethe best el)lion whether or not A lells P, the WatW~Ult l o r  P.Since a w~u','ant makes the dialogue longer, tile Explicit-Wml'~mt strategy might be inefficient whenever either ofthese situalions hold.Now consi(lel a silualiOll where P, is HI) atltOllOlllO|lSagenl I Galliers, 19911.
B always deliberates every pro-posed and B probably knows of oplions which competewith proposal P. Then B c~umot decide whelher to acceptP withoul a warrant.
Supposedly agenl A should omita warrant is if it is ah'eady believed by B, so that thespeaker in 1 woukl not have said It's shorter if she be-lieved that the hem'or knew that file Wahlul St. mute wasshorter.

whether the warnmt is ah'eady accessible inB's working memory \[Prince, 1981; Baddelcy, 1986\].
11the w~u'rant is not already salient, then B must either inferor retrieve the wlurant information or obtain it from anexternal source in order to evaluate A's proposed.
ThusA's slrategy choice may depend oil A's model of B'salteutional stale, as well as the costs of retrieval ~mdinference as opposed to communication.
In other words,A may decide thal it is e~Lsier to just say the warrantrather than require B to infer or retrieve it.Finally, the task determines whether there are penaltieslor leaving a w~ur~mt implicit and relying on B 1o interor relrieve it.
Some tasks require that two agents agreeoil tile reasons lot adopting a proposal, e.g.
in order toensure robustness insituations of environmental change.
()ther tasks, such ~ts a mmmgement/union negotiation,only require the agents to agree on the actions to becluried out and each agent can have its own reasonslot wanting tl~ose actions to be done withoul affectingsuccess in the lask.Figure 1 summ~uizes these hypotheses by proposinga hypothetical decision lree for an agent's choice ofwhetlmr to use the Explicit-W~n-rlmt s rategy.
The choiceis hypothesized todepend oil cognitive properties of B,e.g.
what B knows, B's anentiomd state, lind B's pro-cessing capabilities, as well as properties of the tikskand the communication cl~annel.
To my knowledge, allprevious work on di~dogne has simply assumed that ,'magent should never tell ~m agen!
facts that the other agentalready knows.
The hypotheses in figure 1 seem coin-pie\[ely plausible, but the relationship of cognitive ffortto dildogue behavior has never been explored.
Giventhese hypotheses, what is required is a way to test thehypothesized relationship oft~tsk and cognitive factors toeffective discourse strategies.

In l)esign-Wodd,salience is modeled by AWM model, adapted lronl \[Lan-dauer, 1975 I.
While the AWM model is extremely sin>pie, \[,andauer showed thai it could be pm'ameterized lo 1ilmany empirical resells on human memory and learning\[Baddeley, 19861.
AWM consists of a three dimensionalslsace in which propositions acquired Dora perceiving theworld are stored in chronological sequence according 1otile localion o1' a moving memory pointef.
The sequenceof memory loci iised lof slotage constitutes a fI.Itldolllwalk lhrough memory wilh each loci a shorl dislancelfonl tile previous one.
If items are encountefed illtlllipletimes, they me stored nmlliple limes \[Itinlzmann andBlock, 1971\].Whell }Ill agellt rchieves ilenls 1}o111 inelllOfy, searchslarls from tile current poinlef Iocalion and spreads out1207in a spherical fashion.
Search is restricted to a particularse,'u'ch radius: radius is defined in Hiunming distance.For ex~unple if the current memory pointer loci is (0 0 (1),the loci dist~mce 1 away would be (0 1 0) (0 -1 0) (0 0 l) (00 - 1) (- 1 0 0) (1 0 0).
The actual ocations are cldculatedmodulo the memory size.
The limit on the search radiusdefines the capacity of attention/working memory andhence defines which stored beliefs and intentions areSAI ,IENT.Thc radius of tile search sphere in the AWM modelis used as the par,'uneter for Design-World agents'resource-bound on attentional capacity.
In the exper-iments below, memory is 16x16x16 and tile radius pa-rmneler v~n'ies between 1and 16, where AWM of 1 givesseverely attention limited agents imd AWM of 16 meansthat everything an agent knows is accessible.
3 This pa-rluneter lets us distinguish between an agent's ability toaccess all the inlimnation stored in its memory, lind theeffort involved in doing so.The advantages of the AWM model is that it wasshown to reproduce, in simulation, mlmy results on hu-man memory ~md lem'ning.
Because search st~n'ts fromthe current pointer location, items that have been storedmost recently are more likely to be retrieved, predictingrecency effects \[BMdeley, 19861.
Because items thatare stored in multiple locations are more likely to be re-trieved, tbe model predicts fiequency effects \[Hiutzmmmand Block, 1971 I.
Because items are stored in chrono-IogicN sequence, the model produces natural associativ-ity effects \[Landaner, 19751.
Because deliberation andmeans-end re~tsoning can only operate on salient belietls,limited attention produces a concomitlmt inl)rential lim-itation, i.e.
if a belief is nol salient it cannot be used indeliberation or mcans-end-reltsoniug.
This means thatmistakes that agents make in their planning process havea plansible cognitive basis.
Agents can both fail to ac-cess a belief that would idlow them to produce ,an optim~dplan, its well as make a mistake in pl~mning if a beliefabout bow the world has changed its a result of pllmningis not sldicnt.
I)epending on the preceding discourse, andthe agent's attentionld capacity, the propositions that imagent knows may or may not be salient when a proposedis made.Another hypothetical riveter was the relative cost of re-trievld and communication.
AWM ~dso gives ns a way tomeasure tile nmnber of retriev~ds from memory in termsof tile number of locations searched to find a proposi-tion.
The iunount of effort required li)r each retrievalstep is a parmnetel, its is tile cost of each inference steplind the cost of each communicated message.
These costparluneters supporl modeling v~uious cognilive mchitec-tures, e.g.
vmying tile cost of retrieved models differentassumptions ahout memory.
For example, if retrieval isfree then ~dl items in working memory me instfmtly ac-cessible, as they would be if they were stored in registerswith litst p~uallel access.
If AWM is set to 16, but re-lrievzd isn't free, tile model approximates slow spreading3The size of memory was determined as adequate for producing the desired level ~1' variation in tile current task acrossall the experimental variables, while slill making it possible toI'1.1 n a large iltlnlher el" simtllalions over  night wherl agents haveaccess to all of their memory.
In order Io use the AWM modelin a different ask, the experimenter might want to exploredilferent sizes lbr memory.activation that is quite effortful, yet the agent still has theability to access ~dl of memory, given enough time.
IfAWM is set lower than 16 ~md retrievld isn't liee, thenwe model slow spreading activation with a timeout whene/fort exceeds acertain ~unount, so that im agent does nothave the ability to access all of memory.It does not make sense to fix absolute v~dues li)r the re-trievld, inference lind communication cost plu~uncters inrelation to human processing.
However, Design-Worldsupports exploring issues about he relative costs of vlu'-ions processes.
These relative costs might v,'u'y depend-ing,on the language that the agents are communicat-ing with, properties of the communication channel, howsmtu't tile agents ,arc, how much time they have, lind whatthe demands of the ti~sk are \[Norm~m and Bobrow, 1975\].Below we vary tile relative cost of communication andretrieval.Fin~dly, we hypothesized that the Explicit-Wm3'antstrategy may be beneficial if the relationship betweeuthe wlm'imt and the proposed must be mutu~dly believed.Thus the delinition of success for the task is a Design-World plu','uneter: the Stimd~u'd task does not require ashared wlu'r~mt, whereas the Zero NonMatching Beliefstask gives a zero score to any negotiated plan withoutagreed-upon warrants.3.4 Evaluating Perfiwmanceqb evlduate PERFOI),MANCti, We compare the Explicit-Winximt strategy with tbe All-Implicit strategy in sit-uations where we vm'y the tltsk requirements, agents'attcntiotud capacity, lind the cost of retrieval, inferenceand communication.
Evlduation of tile resulting I)ESIGN-IIOtJSli plan is p~u'~unctrized by (1) ('OMMCOST: COSt ofsending a message; (2) INFCOST: cost of inference; and(3) RETCOST: COSt of retrieval from memory:I'ERFORMANCE= Task Defined RAW SCORI~((!OMM(~OST x number of messages)- (INFCOST x nnmber  o f  in fe rences)- (RETCOST X number of retrieved steps)RAW S(:ORE is task specilic: ill the Stand'ud task wesimply summiu'ize the point values of the furniture piecesin each PUT-A('T ill the fined Design, while in tile ZeroNonMatching Beliefs task, agents get no points for apllm unless they agree on the reasons underlying eachaction that contributes to the plan.The way I'ERFORMANCI!

Thecosts that ~u'e deducted liom tbe RAW SCORE are thecosts for both agents' communication, inference, m~dretrieval.

Thisis because making the wammt salient displaces infor-mation about other pieces of furniture when agents m'eattention-limited.
In the St,'uld~u'd t&sk, agents m'en't re-quired to sh,'ue beliefs about the value of a proposed, soremembering what pieces they have is more importmltthan remembering their value.However, figure 4 shows that Explicit-Wm'rm~t is ben-elici~d when retrieval is one tenth tile cost of communi-cation :rod inference.
By AWM v,'dues of 3, performance1209wilh Explicit-W~u'rant is belier than All-Implicit becauselhe beliefs necess~n'y for deliberation are made salienlwith each proposal (KS lk)r AWM of 3 and above >.23, p < .01).
At AWM parameter settings el' 16, whereagenls have lhe ability to search all their beliefs lk)r war-rants, the saving in processing time is substantial.
Againat the lowest AWM seltings, the slrategy is not benefi-cial because it displaces information about other piecesfronl AWM.
However in figure 4, in conlr&st wilh ligure3, retrieval has an associated cost.

This is because the Explicit-Warr~mtslralegy increases the number of ntter~mces required toperform Ihe task; it doubles the number of messages inevery proposal.
If communication is expensive com-pared to retrieval, communication cost can dominate theother benelits.l!

The fact thatrelrieval is indclcrminate produces this effect; a simi-hit resnll is oblained when wm'r~mls are required andrelriewll costs someihing.To my great surprise, Ihe benelicial effect of Explicit-W~uralll for the Zero-NonMatching-Beliefs task is sorobust thal even if communication cost is 10 and re-irieval and inference are fl+ee, Explicil-Warrant is betterthan AII-hnplicit at AWM of 3 ?..

In other words, even when everyextra WARRANT message incurs a penalty of 10 poinls,if the task is Zero-NonMatching-Beliefs, agents usingExplicit-W~u'rant do belier.

)rnlation thatis needed to complete the task, e.g.
when AWM is verylimited and wm'r\[mts ~ue not required to be shared.Tile method used here is a new experimental method-elegy for computational linguistics that supports testinghypotheses about benelici~d isconrse strategies \[Car-letta, 1992; Pollack and Ringuelle, 1990\].
The Design-World environment is b~tsed on a cognitive model oflimited attention ~md supports experimenls on the in-teraction of discourse strategies with agents' cognitivelimitations.
The use of the method and the focns of lhiswtnk are novel: previous work has l~)CliSed Oil determin-ing nnderlying mechanisnls ?~r cooperative strategiesrather than on investigating when a slrategy is elIective.To my knowledge, no previous work on di;dogue l/~tsever argued that conversational agents' resonroe l imitsare a lnajor factor in determining ?IIective conversationalstrategies in collaboration.
Tim resulls presented heresuggest that cooperative strategies cannot be delhied inthe abslracl, but cooperation arises from the interactionof two agents in dialogue.
If one agent has limited work-ing memory, then the ()thor agenl can make the di~dogucgo more slnoothly by adopting astrategy that makes de-liberative premises salient.
In other words, slrategies ~uecooperative for certain conversational p;u'tners, in/derparticular task delinitions, lor p~uticul~u communicalionsituations.Here we compared two discourse strategies: All-hnplicit ~ul(l Explicit-Warr~mh Explicit-W;uranl is atype of discourse stralegy called ~m Attelition strategyin \[W;dkel; 1993\] because its main lunction is to ma-nipulate agents' altenlional slate.
Elsewhere we show1210that (1) some IRU strategies are only beneficial when in-ferential complexity is higher Ihall in the Standard "l,u,~k\[R~unbow and Walker, 1994; Walker, 1994al; (2) IRUsthat make intL'rences explicit can help inlbrence lim-ited agents perlorm as well as logic;ally omniscient onesI Walker, 199311.Although much work remains to be done, there is rea-son to believe that these results are (Iomsdn independent.The simplicity of the Design-World task inemls thai its,',;trllCttlr(.
