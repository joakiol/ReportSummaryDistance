PROBLEMS IN LOGICAL FORMRobert C. MooreSRI International, Menlo Park, CA 94025I INTRODUCTIONDecomposition of the problem of "languageunderstanding" into manageable subproblems has alwaysposed a major  challenge to  the deve lopment  theor ies  of,and sys tems fo r ,  natura l - language process ing .
More orless  d i s t inc t  components  a re  convent iona l ly  p roposed  fo rhand l ing  syntax ,  semant ics ,  p ragmat ics ,  and in ference .Whi le  d i sagreement  ex is ts  as  to  what  phenomena proper lybe long  in  each  area ,  and how much or  what  k inds  o fin teract ion  there  are  among these  components ,  there  i sfa i r ly  w idespread  concur rence  as to the overa l lo rgan izat ion  of linguistic process ing .Central to this approach is the idea that theprocessing of an utterance involves producing anexpression or structure that is in some sense arepresentation of the literal meaning of the utterance.It is often maintained that understanding what anutterance literally means consists in being able torecover this representation.
In philosophy andlinguistics this sort of representation is usually saidto  d isp lay  t h e ~  form o f  an  ut terance ,  so  we w i l lre fer  (somewhat loosely-~--  to  the  representat ionsthemse lves  as  " log ica l  fo rms, "This paper  surveys  what we at  SRI view as some ofthe  key prob lems encountered in defining a system ofrepresentation for the logical forms of Englishsentences, and suggests possible approaches to theirsolution.
We will first look at some general issuesrelated to the notion of logical form, and then discussa number of problems associated with the way informationinvolving certain key concepts is expressed in English.Although our main concern here is with theoreticalissues rather than with system performance, this paperis not merely speculative.
The DIALOGIC systemcurrently under development in the SKI ArtificialIntelligence Center parses English sentences andtranslates them into logical forms embodying many of theideas presented  here.II THE NATURE OF LOGICAL FORMpieces of the logical form of the utterance thatconstitute referring expressions.
Having logical formsbe semantically compositional is the ultimate expressionof this kind of decomposability, as it renders ev,erywell-formed subexpression a locus of meanlng--andtherefore a potential locus of meanlng-dependentprocessing.
This is probably a more telling argumentfor semantic composltlonality in designing language-processing systems than in analyzing human language, butit can be reasonably argued that such design principlesmust be followed by any system, whether natural orartificial, that has to adapt to a complex environment(see \[Simon, 1969\], especially Chapter  4).
ILogical form, therefore, is proposed as a level ofrepresentation distinct from surface-syntactlc form,because  there  i s  apparent ly  no d i rec t  way tosemantically interpret natural language sentences in acompositional fashion.
Some linguists and philosophershave challenged th i s  assumption \[Montague, 1974a\]\[Barwlse and Cooper, 1981\], but  the complexity of theirproposed systems and the limited range of syntacticforms they consider leave serlous doubt that thelogical-form level can be completely bypassed.
2Beyond be ing  co~pos i t ioue l ,  i t  is des i rab le - - thoughperhaps  not  essent ia l - - that  the  mean ing  of  a log ica lform also be independent of the context in which theassociated utterance occurs.
(The meaning of anexpression in natural language, of course, is oftencontext-dependent.)
A language-processing system musteventually produce a context-independent representationof what the speaker means by an utterance because thecontent of the utterance will normally be subjected tofurther processln E after the original context has beenlost.
In the many cases in which the speaker's intendedmeaning is simply the literal meaning, a context-i ndependent  logical form would give us therepresentat ion  we need.
There is little doubt that somerepresentation of this sort is required.
For example,much of our general knowledge of the world is derivedfrom simple assertions of fact in natural language, butour situation would be hopeless if, for every fact weknew, we had to remember the context in which it wasobtained before we could use it appropriately.
Imaginetrying to decide what to do with a tax  refund by havingto recall whether the topic of conversation was riversor financial institutions the first time one heard thatbanks were good places in which to keep money.The first question to ask is, why even have a levelof logical form?
After all, sentences of naturallanguages are themselves conveyers of meaning; that iswhat natural languages are for.
The reason for havinglogical foznns is to present the literal meanings ofsentences more perspicuously than do the sentencesthemselves.
It is sometimes said that natural-languagesentences do not '~ear their meanings on their sleeves";logical forms are intended to do exactly that.From this perspect ive ,  the  main desideratum for asystem of logical form is that its semantics becompositional.
That is, the meaning of a complexexpression should depend only on the  meaning of itssubexpresslons.
This is needed for meanlnE-dependentcou~utational processes to cope with logical forms ofarbitrary complexity.
If there is to be any hope ofmaintaining an intellectual grasp of what theseprocesses are doing, they must be decomposable intosmaller and smaller meanlng-dependent subprocessesoperating on smaller and smaller meaningful pieces of alogical form.
For instance, if identifying the entitiesreferred to by an utterance is a subprocess of inferringthe speaker's intentions, there must be identifiableAs this example suggests, context independence isclosely related to the resolution of ambiguity.
For anygiven ambiguity, it is possible to find a case in whichthe information needed tO resolve it is derived from thecontext of an utterance.
Therefore, if the meanlnEs oflogical forms are to be context-lndependent, the systemof logical forms must provide distinct, unambiguousrepresentations for all possible readings of anambiguous utterance.
The question remains whetherlogical form should also provide ambiguousrepresentations to handle cases i n  which thedlsamblguatlng information is obtained later or issimply general world knowledge.
The pros and cons ofsuch an approach are far from clear, so we willgenerally assume only unembIEuous logical forms.Although it is sometimes assumed that a context-independent representation of the literal meaning of asentence  can  be der ived  by us ing  syntact i c  and semant icknowledge only, some pragmatic factors must also betaken into account.
To take a concrete example, supposethe request "Please llst the Nobel Prize winners inphysics," is followed by the question '~dho are theAmericans?"
The phrase "the Americans" in the secondutterance should almost certainly be interpreted as117re fer r ing  to  Amer ican  w inners  o f  the  Nobel  P r i ze  inphysics, rather than all inhabitants or citizens of theUnited States, as It might be understood in isolation.If the logical form of the utterance is to reflect theintended interpretation, processes that are normallyassigned to praSmatlcs must be used to  derive i t .One could attempt to avoid thls consequence byrepresenting "the Americans" at the level of logicalform as literally meaning all Americans, and have laterpragmatic processing restrict the interpretation coAmerican winners of the Nobel Prize in physics.
Thereare other cases, however, for which thls sort of move isnot  ava i lab le .
Cons ider  more care fu l ly  the  ad jec t ive"Amer ican . "
Amer ican  peop le  cou ld  be e i ther  inhab i tantso r  c i t i zens  o f  the  Un i ted  States ;  Amer ican  cars  cou ld  bee i ther  manufactured  or  d r iven  in  the  Un i ted  States ;Amer ican  food  cou ld  be food  produced or  consumed in  o rp repared  in  a s ty le  ind igenous  Co the  Un i ted  States .
Inshort, the meaning of "American" seems to be no morethan "bearing some contextually determined relation tothe United States."
Thus, there is n~o deflnlte context-independent mesnlng for sentences containing modifiersllke "American."
The same is t rue  for many uses of"have," "of," possessives, l ocat ive  prepos i t ions\[Herskovits, 1980\] and compound nominals.
The only wayto hold fast to the position that the  construction ofloglcal-form precedes  all pragmatic processing seems tobe to put in "dummy'* symbols for the unknown relations:This m@y in fact be very useful in building an actualsystem, ~ but It is hard to imagine that such a level ofrepresentation would bear much theoretical weight.We will chum assume that  a theoreticallyi n teres t ing  level of logical form will have reso lvedcontextua l ly  dependent  de f in i te  re ferences ,  as  we l l  asthe  ocher  " loca l "  p ragmat ic  lndeterminac ies  ment ioned.An impor tant  consequence  o f  th i s  v iew i s  that  sentencesper  se do not  have  log ica l  fo rms~ on ly  sentences  incontext  ~.~-~f  we speak  loose ly  o f  the  log ica l  fo rm o fa sentence ,  th i s  i s  how I t  shou ld  be in terpreted .If we go thls far, why not say that all pragmaClcprocessing Cakes place before the logical form isconstructed?
That is, why make any distinction at allbetween what  the  speaker  in tends  the  hearer  to  in fe rf rom an ut terance  and what  the  ut terance  l i te ra l lymeans?
There  are  two answers  co th i s .
The f i r s t  i sthat ,  wh i le  the  pragmat ic  fac tors  we have  in t roducedin to  the  der ivat ion  o f  log ica l  fo rm so fa r  a re  ra thernarrowly c i rcumscr ibed  (e.g., resolving definitelydetermined noun phrases) ,  the  in ference  o f  speakerin tent ions  i s  complete ly  open-ended.
The prob lemconfronting the hearer is to answer the question, 'Whywould the  speaker say that in this situation?
"Practically any relevant knowledge chat the speaker andhearer mutually possess \[Clark and Marshall, 1981\]\[Cohen and Perrault, 1981\] may be brought to bear inanswering thls quest ion .
Prom a purely ~echodo log ica  !standpoint, then, one would hope to define some morerestricted notion of meaning as an intermediate step indeve lop ing  the  broader  theory .Even put t ing  as ide  th i s  methodo log ica l  concern ,  i tseems doubt fu l  chat  a theory  o f  in tended mean ing  can  beco~trucCed w i thout  a concomitant thaor?
of literalmeaning ,  because  the  la t te r  not ion  appears  to  p lay  anexp lanatory  ro le  in  the  fo rmer  theory .
Spec i f i ca l ly ,the  l i te ra l  mean ing  o f  an  ut terance  i s  one  o f  choseth ings  f rom which  hearers  in fe r  speakers"  in tent ions .For  ins tance ,  in the  appropr ia te  context ,  " I 'm get t ingco ld"  cou ld  be a request  to  c lose  a w indow.
The on lyway fo r  the  hearer  to  unders tand  th i s  as  a request ,however ,  is to  recover  the  literal content of theutterance, i.e., that the speaker is getting cold, andto infer from this chat the speaker would llke him co dosomething about  It.In summary, the notion of logical form we wish tocapture is essentially that of a representation of the"literal meaning in context" of an utterance.
Tofacilitate further processing, it is virtually essentialthat the meaning of Ioglcal-form expressions becompositional and, at the same time, it is highlydesirable that they be conCext-lndependenc.
The lattercondition requires that a system of logical form furnishdistinct representations for the dlfferenc readings ofambiguous natural-language expressions.
I t  alsorequires chat some l im i ted  amount of prag~at lcp rocess ing  be invo lved  in  produc ing  thoserepresentations.
Finally, we note  that  not allpragmatic factors in the  use of language can bereflected in the logical form of an utterance, becausesome o f  those  fac tors  a re  dependent  on  in format ion  thatthe  logical form itself prov ides .III FORM AND CONTENT IN KNOWLEDGE P.EP&ESENTJtTIONDeveloping a theory of the loglcal form of Englishsentences is as much an exercise in knowledgerepresentation as in linguistics, but ic differs frommost work in  arclficlal intelligence on knowledgerepresentat ion  in one key respect .
Knowledgerepresentat ion  schemes are  usua l ly  in tended by the i rdes igners  to  be as  genera l  as  poss ib le  and to  avo idcom~aitment to any particular concepts .
The essentialproblem for a theory of logical form, however, is corepresent specific concepts chat natural languages havespecial features for expressing information about.Concepts that fall in chls category include:* Events, actions, and procesmes* Time and space* Collective entities and substances* Propositional attitudes and modalltles.A theory of logical form of natural-languageexpress ions ,  there fore ,  i s  p r imar i ly  concerned w i th  thecontent  ra ther  than  the  fo rm o f  representat ion .
Log ic ,semant ic  networks ,  f rames ,  sc r ip ts ,  and  product ionsys tems are  a l l  d i f fe rent  fo rms of  representat ion .
Butto  say  mere ly  that  one has  adopted  one  o f  these  fo rms i sto  say  noth ing  about  content ,  i .

Th isp ro jec t  might  thus  be bet ter  descr ibed  as  knowledgeencodln 6 to distinguish It from knowledgerepresentat ion ,  as i t  i s  usually unders tood  inarclflcial intelligence.IV A FRAMEWORK FOR LOGICAL FORMAs ment ioned prev ious ly ,  the  bas ic  f r -mework  wew i l l  use  to  represent  the  log ica l  form o f  Eng l i shsentences  i s  h igher -order  log ic  ( i .d .

Hence ,  ourI18  ?adherence Co that principle is a good-falth intentionrather than a demsnstrated fact.
It should be noted,though, that  virtually all the kinds of  lo~tcalconstructs used here are drawn from more formal work oflogicians and ph i losophers  in which r igorous  semant ictreatments are provided.The only place in which our logical languagediffers sigulflcancly from more familiar syscezs is Inthe treatment of quantiflers.
Normally the Englishdeterminers "every" and "some" are translated as logicalquantlfiers that bind a single variable in an arbitraryfo rmula .
This requ i res  us ing  an  appropr ia te  log ica lconnect ive  co combine the  contents  o f  the  noun phrasegoverned by the  determiner  w i th  the  contents  o f  the  res to f  the  sentence .
Thus '~very  P i s  q"  becomes(EVERY X (IMPLIES (P X) (q X))),and "Some P i s  Q'* becomes(SOME X (AND (e X) (q X)))I t  seems somewhat i ne legant  to  have  to  use  d i f fe rentconnect ives  to  Jo in  (P X) and (~ X) in  the  two cases ,but  semant ica l ly  i t  works .In  an  ext remely  in teres t ing  paper ,  Barwise  andCooper  \ [1981\]  po in t  out  (and ,  in  fac t ,  p rove)  that  thereare  :any  determiners  in  Eng l i sh  fo r  wh ich  th i s  approachdoes  not  work .
The t rans format ions  employed in  s tandardlog ic  co hand le  "every"  and "some"  depend on the  fac tthat  any  s ta tement  about  every  P o r  some P i s  log ica l lyequ iva lent  to  a s ta tement  about  everyth ing  or  someth ing ;fo r  example, "Some P is Q" is equivalent to "Somethingis P and Q."
What Barwlse and Cooper show is that thereis no such  transformation fo r  determiners like "msst" or"more than half."
That  iS, statements about most P's ormore than  ha l f  the  P ' s  cannot  be rephrased  as  s ta tementsabout  most  th ings  or  more than  ha l f  o f  a l l  th ings .Barv ise  and Cooper  incorporate  th i s  ins ight  in to  ara ther  e laborate  sys tem modeled a f te r  Montague 's ,  sothat ,  among other  th ings ,  they  can  ass ign  a denotat ionto  a rb i t ra ry  noun phrases  out  o f  context .
Adopt ing  amore conservat ive  mod i f i ca t ion  o f  s tandard  log ica lnotat ion ,  we w i l l  s imp ly  ins i s t  that  a l l  quant i f iedfo rmulas  have  an  add i t iona l  e lement  express ing  theres t r i c t ion  of the quantifier.
'~ost P's are Q" willthus be represented  by(HOST X (F X) (q X)).Following thls convent ion  g ives  us a uniform t reatmentfo r  determined noun phrases :"Most men are  mortal""Some man is mortal""Every man Is mortal""The man iS mortal""Three men are mortal"Note that we t reat(MOST X (4  X) (MORTAL X))(SOME X (MAN X) (MORTAL X))(EVERY X (MAN X) (MORTAL X))(THE X (MAN X) (MORTAL X))(3 x (HA.
X) (MORTJU.
X))"the" as a quantifier, on a parwlth "some" and "every."
"The" is often treatedformally as an operator  chat  produces  a complex singularterm, but thls has the disadvantage of not indicatingclearly the scope of the expression.A final point about our basic framework I s  thatmost common nouns will be interpreted as relationsrather than functions in logical form.
That is, even Ifwe know that a person has only one height, we willrepresent "John's height is 6 feet" as(HEIGE'?
JOHN (FEET 6))ra ther  than(EQ (HEIGHT JOHN) (FEET 6)) 5There  are  two reasons  fo r  th i s :  one i s  the  des i re  fo r"syntact i c  un i fo rmi ty ;  the  o ther  i s  co have  a var iab leava i lab le  fo r  use  in  complex  pred icates .
Cons ider" John 's  he ight  i s  more than  5 feet  and less  than  6feet."
If height is a relation, we can say(THE L (HEIGHT JOHN L)(AND (GT L (FEET 5))(LT L (FEET 6)))),whereas, if length is a function, we would say(AND (GT (HEIGHT JOHN) (FT 5))(LT (HEIGHT JOHN) (FT 6)))The second variant may look simpler, but it has thed isadvantage  that (HEIGHT JOHN) appears  twice.
This isnot only syntactically unmotivated, since "John'sheight" occurs only once in the original English but,what  i s  worse ,  i t  may lead  Co redundant  prucass lns  la teron.
Let  us  suppose  Chat  we want  to  tes t  whether  theasser t ion  i s  t rue  and that  determin ing  John 's  he ightrequires some expensive operation, such as accessing anexterna l  database .
To avo id  do ing  the  computat iontw ice ,  the  eva luat ion  procedure  must  be much morecomplex  i f  the  second representat ion  i s  used  ra ther  thanthe  f i r s t .V EVENTS, ACTIONS, AND PROCESSESThe source  of  many prob lems in  th i s  a rea  is thequest ion  of  whether  the  t reatment  o f  sentences  thatdescr ibe  events  ( " John  i s  go ing  to  New York" )  shou ldd i f fe r  in  any  fundamenta l  way f rom that  o f  sentenceschat  descr ibe  s ta t i c  s i tuat ions  (* ' John i s  tn  New York" ) .In a very  in f luent ia l  paper ,  Dav idson  \[ 1967\] a rguesthat ,  wh i le  s imple  pred icate /argument  notat ion ,  such  as(LOC JOHN mY), may be adequate  fo r  the  la t te r ,  eventsentences  requ i re  exp l i c i t  re ference  to  the  event  as  anob jec t .

The log ica l  form o f  " John  i s  k i ss ing  Mary" wou lds imply  be (KISS JOHN MARY).
The log ica l  fo rm o f  " Johni s  gent ly  k i ss ing  Mary , "  however ,  would  be(SOME Z (EVENT E)(AND ((EWSS KZSS) Z JoHN ~Y)(GENTLE E))))119I f  we le t  EVABS apply  to complex pred icates( represented  by LAMBDA express ions) ,  we can handle o therproblems as well.
Consider the sentence "Being a parentcaused John's nervous breakdown."
"Parent"  Is arelational noun; thus, if John is a parent, he must hethe parent  of someone, but i f  John has severa l  ch i ld renwe don ' t  want to he forced in to  asser t ing  chat  beinS theparent  of any par t i cu la r  one of them caused thebreakdown.
I f  we had PARENTI as the monadic properry  ofbe in  S a parent ,  however, we cou ld  say(SOME E (EVENT E)(Am) ((EVABS PARENTL) E JOHN)(CAUSE E "John's nervous breakdown")))We don ' t  need tO in t roduce  PARENTI exp l i c i t l y ,  however,i f  we s imply  subst i tu te  for I t  the expression,(LAMBDA X (SOME Y (PERSON Y) (PARENT X Y))),which would g ive  us(SOME E (EVENT E)(AND ((EVANS (LAMBDA X (SOME Y (PERSON Y)(PARZNT x z))))ZJOHN)(CAUSE E "John's nervous breakdown")))Another important  question i s  whether ac t ions - - - chati s ,  events  wlth agents - - shou ld  be t reated  d i f fe rent lyfrom events without agents and, if so, should the agentbe specially indicated?
The po in t  is that, if Johnkissed Mary, that ?s somethln S he did, but notnecessarily something sh....~e did.
Zt is not clear whetherth i s  d i s t inc t ion  should be represented  at  the leve l  oflog ica l  form or is ra ther  an in fe rence  based on worldknowledge.
.Finally, most AS work on ac t ions  and events  assumesthat  they can be decomposed in to  d i sc re te  s teps ,  andthat their effects can be defined in terms of  S finals ta te .
Ne i ther  of these  assumpt ions  i s  appropr ia te  fo rcont inuous  processes ;  e .g .
,  "The f low of water  cont inuedto  f lood the basement."
What the log ica l  form fo r  suchs ta tements  hould look  l i ke  seems co be a complete lyopen quest ion .
6VI TIME AND SPACEWe be l ieve  that  in fo rmat ion  about t ime i s  bes trepresented  pr imar i l y  by sencent ia l  operators ,  so thatthe logical form of a sentence like "John is in New Yorkat  2:00" would be somethln S likm(AT 2:00 (LOt JOHN NY)).
There are two main reasons forfollowing chls approach.
First, current time can bei nd icated  s imply  by the lack  of any operator ;  e ,g .
,"John owns Fido" becomes simply (OWNS JOHN FIDO)o Thisis especially advantageous in baslcsily static dowalnsin which tlme plays a minimal role, so we do not have toput someChln S into the logical form of a sentence chatwi l l  be sys temet ica l ly  ignored by l ower - leve lp rocess ing .
The o ther  advantage of th i s  approach i sthat  temporal  operators  can app ly  Co a whole sentence ,ra ther  than Just  to a verb .
For ins tance ,  in  thepre fer red  read ing  of "The Pres ident  ha8 l i ved  in  theWhite House s ince  1800," the re ferent  of " the  P res ident"changes wi th  the t ime contexts  invo lved  in  eva luat in  Sthe t ru th  of the sentence .
The o ther  read ing  can beobtained by allowing the quanclfier "the" in "thePresident" to assume a wider scope than that of thetemporal operator.Although we do not  s t rong ly  d l s t lnsu lsh  ac t ionverbs from s ta t ive  verbs semant ica l ly ,  there  are120syntact i c  d i s t inc t ions  that  - .
, s t  be taken in to  accountbefore  tense  can be mapped in to  t ime cor rec t ly .
S ta t iveverbs express  present  t ime by means of the s implepresent  tense ,  wh i le  ac t ion  verbs use the presentp rogress ive .
Compare:John k i sses  Mary (normal ly  hab i tua l )John i s  k i ss ln  8 Mary (normal ly  p resent  t ime)John owns Pido (normal ly  p resent  t ime)John i s  owning Fido (unacceptab le )This  i s  why (KISS JOHN MARY) represents  "John i s  k l ss lnsMary," ra ther  than "John k i sses  Mary," which wouldnor~s l ly  rece ive  a d i spos i t iona l  or  hab i tua lin terpreta t ion .What temporal  operators  will be needed?
We willuse the operator  AT to  asser t  that  a cer ta in  cond i t ionho lds  a t  a cer ta in  t ime.
PAST and FUTURE w i l l  bepred icates  on po in ts  in  t ime.
Sinq~le past  tenses ta tements  w i th  sCaCive verbs ,  such a8 "John was in  NewYork," could mean e i ther  that  John was in  New York a tsome unspec i f ied  time In  the past  or  a t  a coutexcua/ lyspec i f i c  t ime in  the past :(SOME T (PAST T) (AT T (LOt JOHN NY)))(TME T (PAST T) (AT T (LOC JOHN NY)))(For the second express ion  to be an "o f f i c ia l "  lo~tca l -form representat ion ,  the  incomplete  de f in i te  re fe rencewould have to be reso lved . )

Froman objective standpoint, it is often convenient to viewphysical space and time together as a four-dlmenslonalEuclidean space.
Furthermore, there are natural-language constructions that seem best interpreted asasserting that a certain condition holds in a particularp lace  ( " In  Ca l i fo rn ia  i t  i s  lega l  to  make a r ight  tu rnon a red  l ight" ) ,  Jus t  as  t ime express ions  o f ten  asser tthat  a cond i t ion  ho lds  a t  a par t i cu la r  t ime.

If we say"Newell and Simon wrote Human Problem Solving," we donot  mean that  they each did it individually (cf.
"Newell and Simon have PhDs.
"), rather we mean that theydid it as a unit.
Furthermore, if we want the treatmentof this sentence to be parallel to chat of "~ulne wroteWord and Ob ject , "  we need an  exp l i c i t  representat ion  o fthe  un i t  "Newell and Simon," so that  I t  can  p lay  thesame role the individual "~ulne" plays in the lattersentence.
These considerations create difficulties insentence interpretation because of the possibility ofambiguities between collective and distributed readings.Thus, "Newell and Simon have written many papers," mightmean that individually each has written many papers orthat they have jointly coauthored many papers.
Theproblems associated with conjoined noun phrases alsoarise with plural noun phrases and singular noun phrasesthat  a re  inherent ly  co l lec t ive .  "

The force of animperative 18 that the person to whom the command isdirected is supposed to satisfy the predlcaCe.According to this theory the role of "make" is clear--itconverts any proposition into a unary predicate.
If theassertion "John Is making glll go Co NOw York" isrepresented as (MAKE JOHN (GO BILL MY)), we can form aunary predicate by LAMBDA abstraction:(LAMBDA X (MAKE X (GO gILL mY)),which would be the semantic content of the command "MakeBill go to New York.

The reason may be that relatlvely fewresearchers have worked in thls area for its own sake.Davldeon's ideas on action sentences, for instance,raised some very interesting points about logical form--but the major debate Ic provoked in the philosophicalllcerature was about the metaphysics of the concept ofaction, noc about the semantics of action sentences.Even when semantics is a major concern, as in the workof Montague, the emphasis is often on showing chatrelatively well-understood subareas of semantics (e.g.,quantificaclon) can be done in a parClcular way, ratherthan on attempting to take on really new problems.An additional difficulty is that so much work hasbeen done in a fragmentary fashion.
It is clear thatthe concept of action is closely related to the conceptof time, but it is hard to find any work on eitherconcept that takes the other one seriously.
To build alanguage-processlng system or  a theory of languageprocessing, however, requires an integrated theory oflogical form, not Just a set of incompatible fragmentarytheories.
Our conclusion, then, is chac if realprogress is to be made on understanding the logical formof natural-language utterances, it must be studied in aunified way and treated as an important research problemin its own right.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe ideas in this paper are the collective resultof the efforts of a large number of people at SRI,par t i cu la r ly  Barbara  Grosz ,  SCan Rosensche ln ,  and Garydendr ix .

This research was supportedby the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency underContracts N00039-80-C-0645 and N00039-80-C-0575 with theNaval Electronic Systems Command.NOTESI A l though our  immediate  a im i s  to const ruct  a theory  ofnatura l - language process ing  ra ther  than t ru th -cond i t iona l  semant ics ,  I t  i s  worth not ing  that a systemof  logical form wlth a well-deflned semanticsconst i tu tes  a br idge  between the  two pro jec ts .
I f  wehave a process ing  theory  that  assoc ia tes  Eng l i shsentences with their logical forms, and if those loKicalforms have a truth-~ondltional semantics, then we willhave specified the semantics of the English sentences aswell.2 In other papers (e.g., \[Montague, 1974b\]), Montaguehimself uses an intenslonal logic in exactly the role wepropose for logical form--and for much the same reason:'We could ... introduce the semantics of our fraKment\ [of  Eng l i sh \ ]  d i rec t ly ;  but  I t  I s  p robab ly  merepersp icuous  to  proceed ind i rec t ly  by ( I )  se t t ing  up acer ta in  s imp le  a r t i f i c ia l  l anguage,  that  of tensedIntenslonal l og ic ,  (2) giving the  semantics of thatlanguage, and (3) interpreting English indirectly byshowing in a rigorous way how to translate it into theartificial language.
This Is the procedure we shalladopt;..." \[Montague, 1974b, p.256\].3 The DIALOGIC system does build such a representation,or at least components of one, as an intermediate stepin deriving the logical form of a sentence.4 This suggests chac our logical forms arerepresentations of what David Kaplan, in his famousunpublished paper on demonstratives \[Kaplan, 1977\],calls the content of a sentence, as opposed to Itscharacter.
Kaplan introduces the content/characterdistinction to sort out puzzles connected wlth the useof demonstratives and Indaxlcals.
He notes that thereare at least two different notions of "the meaning of asentence" that conflict when indexical expressions areused.
If A says to B, "I am hungry," and g says to A,"~ am hungry," they have used the same words, but in onesense they mean different things.
After all, it may bethe case that what A said is true and what B said isfalse.
If A says to g, "~ am hungry," and B says to A,"You are hungry," they have used different words, butmean the same thing, that A is hungry.
This notion of"meaning different things" or "meaning the same thing"is one kind of meaning, which Kaplan calls "content.
"There Is another sense, though, In which A and g bothuse the words "I am hungry" with the same meanlng,namely, that the same rules apply to determine, incontext, what content is expressed.
For thls notion ofmeaning, Kaplan uses the term "character."
Kaplan'snotion, therefore, is that the rules of the languagedetermine the character of a sentence--whlch, in turn,together wlth the context of utterance, determines thecontent.
If ~ broaden the scope of Kaplan's theory toinclude the local pragmatic indetermlnacles we havediscussed, i t  seems Chec the  way they depend on contextwould also be part of the character of a sentence andChat our logical form is thus a representation of thecontent of the sentence-ln-context.5 It should be obvious from the example that nounsreferring to unlCs of measure--e.g., "feet"--are anexception co the general rule.
We treat types ofquanCitles, such as distance, weight, volume, time123duracioo, etc., as basic conceptual categories.Following Hayes \[1979\], unlCs such as feet, pounds,gallons, and hours are considered to be functions fromnumbers,to quantities.
Thus (FEET 3) and (YARDS l)denote the same distance.
Halations llke length,weight, size, and duration hold between an entity and aquantity of an appropriate type.
Where a word llke"welghc" serves in English to refer co both the relaClonand the quantity, we must be careful Co dlsClngulshbetween chem.
To see the dlscincCion, note Chac length,beam, and draft are all relaclons between a ship and aquanClcy of the same type, discance.
We treatcomparatives llke "greater than" as molcidomainrelaclons, working with any two quanciCles of the sametype (or wich pure numbers, for chac matter) .6 Hendrix \[1973\], Rieger \[1975\], Hayes \[1978\], andMcDermott \[1981\] have a l l  dea l t  with conClnuousprocesses co some extent ,  buc none of them hasconsidered specifically how language expressesinformation about processes.7 This point was impressed upon me by Pat Hayes.REFERENCESBarwise, J. and R.
