Comparing SCANMail to a regu-lar voicemail interface in a user study, SCANMail performed betterboth in terms of objective (time to and quality of solutions) as wellas subjective objectives.1.
INTRODUCTIONIncreasing amounts of public, corporate, and private audio presenta major challenge to speech, information retrieval, and human-computer interaction research: how can we help people to take ad-vantage of these resources when current techniques for navigatingthem fall far short of text-based search methods?
In this paper,we describe SCANMail, a system that employs automatic speechrecognition (ASR), information retrieval (IR), information extrac-tion (IE), and human computer interaction (HCI) technology to per-mit users to browse and search their voicemail messages by contentthrough a GUI interface.
A CallerId server also proposes callernames from existing caller acoustic models and is trained fromuser feedback.
An Email server sends the original message plusits ASR transcription to a mailing address specified in the user?sprofile.
The SCANMail GUI also provides note-taking capabilitiesas well as browsing and querying features.
Access to messages andinformation about them is presented to the user via a Java appletrunning under Netscape.
Figure 1 shows the SCANMail GUI..2.
SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONIn SCANMail, messages are first retrieved from a voicemail server,then processed by the ASR server that provides a transcription.
Themessage audio and/or transcription are then passed to the IE, IR,Email, and CallerId servers.
The acoustic and language model ofthe recognizer, and the IE and IR servers are trained on 60 hours ofa 100 hour voicemail corpus, transcribed and hand labeled for tele-phone numbers, caller names, times, dates, greetings and closings.The corpus includes approximately 10,000 messages from approx-imately 2500 speakers.
About 90% of the messages were recordedfrom regular handsets, the rest from cellular and speaker-phones.The corpus is approximately gender balanced and approximately12% of the messages were from non-native speakers.
The meanduration of the messages was 36.4 seconds; the median was 30.0seconds.2.1 Automatic Speech RecognitionThe baseline ASR system is a decision-tree based state-clusteredtriphone system with 8k tied states.
The emission probabilities ofthe states are modeled by 12 component Gaussian mixture distribu-tions.
The system uses a 14k vocabulary, automatically generatedby the AT&T Labs NextGen Text To Speech system.
The languagemodel is a Katz-style backoff trigram trained on 700k words fromthe transcriptions of the 60 hour training set.
The word-error rateof this system on a 40 hour test set is 34.9%.Since the messages come from a highly variable source both interms of speaker as well as channel characteristics, transcription ac-curacy is significantly improved by application of various normal-ization techniques, developed for Switchboard evaluations [9].
TheASR server uses Vocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN) [5],Constrained Modelspace Adaptation (CMA) [3], Maximum Like-lihood Linear Regression (MLLR) [6] and Semi-Tied Covariances(STC) [4] to obtain progressively more accurate acoustic modelsand uses these in a rescoring framework.
In contrast to Switch-board, voicemail messages are generally too short too allow directapplication of the normalization techniques.
A novel message clus-tering algorithm based on MLLR likelihood [1] is used to guaranteesufficient data for normalization.
The final transcripts, obtained af-ter 6 recognition passes, have a word error rate of 28.7% ?
a 6.2%accuracy improvement.
Gender dependency provides 1.6% of thisgain.
VTLN then additively improves accuracy with 1.0% whenapplied only on the test data and an additional 0.3% when sub-sequently applied with a VTLN trained model.
The use of STCfurther improves accuracy with 1.2%.
Finally CMA and MLLRprovide additive gains of 1.5% and 0.6% respectively.
The ASRFigure 1: The SCANMail User Interfaceserver, running on a 667 MHz 21264 Alpha processor, producesthe final transcripts in approximately 20 times real-time.2.2 Information RetrievalMessages transcripts are indexed by the IR server using the SMARTIR [8, 2] engine.
SMART is based on the vector space modelof information retrieval.
It generates weighted term (word) vec-tors for the automatic transcriptions of the messages.
SMART pre-processes the automatic transcriptions of each new message by to-kenizing the text into words, removing common words that appearon its stop-list, and performing stemming on the remaining wordsto derive a set of terms, against which later user queries can becompared.
When the IR server is used to execute a user query, thequery terms are also converted into weighted term vectors.
Vectorinner-product similarity computation is then used to rank messagesin decreasing order of their similarity to the user query.2.3 Information ExtractionKey information is extracted from the ASR transcription by theIE server, which currently extracts any phone numbers identifiedin the message.
Currently, this is done by recognizing digit stringsand scoring them based on the sequence length.
An improved ex-traction algorithm, trained on our hand-labeled voicemail corpus,employs a digit string recognizer combined with a trigram languagemodel, to recognize strings in their lexical contexts, e.g.
<word><digit string> <word>.2.4 Caller IdentificationThe CallerID server proposes caller names by matching mes-sages against existing caller models; this module is trained fromuser feedback.
The caller identification capability is based on textindependent speaker recognition techniques applied to the processedspeech in the voicemail messages.
A user may elect to label a mes-sage he/she has reviewed with a caller name for the purpose ofcreating a speaker model for that caller.
When the cumulative du-ration of such user-labeled messages is sufficient, a caller modelis constructed.
Subsequent messages will be processed and scoredagainst this caller model and models for other callers the user mayhave designated.
If the best matching model score for an incom-ing message exceeds a decision threshold, a caller name hypothesisis sent to the GUI client; if there is no PBX-supplied identifica-tion (i.e.
caller name supplied from the owner of the extension forcalls internal to the PBX), the CallerId hypothesis is presented inthe message header, for either accepting or editing by the user; ifthere is a PBX identification, the CallerId hypothesis appears as thefirst item in a user ?contact menu?, together with all previously id?dcallers for that user.
To optimize the use of the available speechdata, and to speed model-building, caller models are shared amongusers.
Details and a performance evaluation of the CallerId processare described in [7].2.5 Graphical User InterfaceIn the SCANMail GUI, users see message headers (callerid, timeand date, length in seconds, first line of any attached note, andpresence of extracted phone numbers) as well as a thumbnail andthe ASR transcription of the current message.
Any note attachedto the current message is also displayed.
A search panel permitsusers to search the contents of their mailbox by inputting any textquery.
Results are presented in a new search window, with key-words color-coded in the query, transcript, and thumbnail.2.6 User StudiesUser studies compared SCANMail with a standard over-the-phonevoicemail access.
Eight subjects performed a series of fact-finding,relevance ranking, and summarization tasks on artificial mailboxesof twenty messages each, using either SCANMail or phone access.SCANMail showed advantages for fact-finding and relevance rank-ing tasks in quality of solution normalized by time to solution, forfact-finding in time to solution and in overall user preference.
Nor-malized performance scores are higher when subjects employ IRsearches that are successful (i.e.
the queries they choose containwords correctly recognized by the recognizer) and for subjects wholisten to less audio and rely more upon the transcripts.
However, wealso found that SCANMail?s search capability can be misleading,causing subjects to assume that they have found all relevant doc-uments when in fact some are NOT retrieved, and that when sub-jects rely upon the accuracy of the ASR transcript, they can misscrucial but unrecognized information.
A trial of 10 friendly usersis currently underway, with modifications to access functionalitysuggested by our subject users.
A larger trial of the system is be-ing prepared, for more extensive testing of user behavior with theirown mailboxes over time.AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank Andrej Ljolje, S. Parthasarathy,Fernando Pereira, and Amit Singhal for their help in developingthis application.3.
