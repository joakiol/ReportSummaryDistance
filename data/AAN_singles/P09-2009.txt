Inthis paper, we present our work on partof speech (POS) tagging for Assameseusing the well-known Hidden MarkovModel.
Since no well-defined suitabletagset was available, we develop a tagsetof 172 tags in consultation with expertsin linguistics.
For successful tagging,we examine relevant linguistic issues inAssamese.
For unknown words, weperform simple morphological analysisto determine probable tags.
Using amanually tagged corpus of about 10000words for training, we obtain a taggingaccuracy of nearly 87% for test inputs.1 IntroductionPart of Speech (POS) tagging is the process ofmarking up words and punctuation characters ina text with appropriate POS labels.
The problemsfaced in POS tagging are many.
Many words thatoccur in natural language texts are not listed in anycatalog or lexicon.
A large percentage of wordsalso show ambiguity regarding lexical category.The challenges of our work on POS taggingfor Assamese, an Indo-European language, arecompounded by the fact that very little priorcomputational linguistic exists for the language,though it is a national language of India andspoken by over 30 million people.
Assamese is amorphologically rich, free word order, inflectionallanguage.
Although POS tagged annotatedcorpus for some of the Indian languages such asHindi, Bengali, and Telegu (SPSAL, 2007) havebecome available lately, a POS tagged corpus forAssamese was unavailable till we started creatingone for the work presented in this paper.
Anotherproblem was that a clearly defined POS tagset forAssamese was unavailable to us.
As a part of thework reported in this paper, we have developeda tagset consisting of 172 tags, using this tagsetwe have manually tagged a corpus of about tenthousand Assamese words.In the next section we provide a brief relevantlinguistic background of Assamese.
Section 3contains an overview of work on POS tagging.Section 4 describes our experimental setup.
InSection 5, we analyse the result of our workand compare the performance with other models.Section 6 concludes this paper.2 Linguistic Characteristics of AssameseIn Assamese, secondary forms of words areformed through three processes: affixation,derivation and compounding.
Affixes play a veryimportant role in word formation.
Affixes are usedin the formation of relational nouns and pronouns,and in the inflection of verbs with respect tonumber, person, tense, aspect and mood.
Forexample, Table 1 shows how a relational nounedtA (deutA: father) is inflected depending onnumber and person (Goswami, 2003).
ThoughAssamese is relatively free word order, yet thepredominant word order is subject-object-verb(SOV).The following paragraphs describe just a fewof the many characteristics of Assamese text thatmake the tagging task complex.?
Depending on the context, even a commonword may have differentPOS tags.
For example: If kAreN (kArane),der (dare), inime?
(nimitte), ehtu (hetu), etc.,are placed after pronominal adjective, theyare considered conjunction and if placed after33Table 1: Personal definitives are inflected onperson and numberPerson Singular Plural1stMy father Our fatherpzm emAr edtA aAmAr edtAmor deutA aAmAr deutA2ndYour father Your fathermAn mxm etAmAr edtArA etAmAelAkr edtArAtomAr deutArA tomAlokar deutArA2nd, Familiar Your father Your fathertu?

For example, kAreN m ngelwA.TF1: ei kArane moi nagalo.This + why + I+ did not go.ET2: This is why I did not go.rAmr kAreN m ngelwA.TF : rAmar kArane moi nagalo.Ram?s + because of + I + did not goET : I did not go because of Ram.In the first sentence kAreN (kArne) is placedafter pronominal adjective  (ei); so kArneis considered conjunction.
But in thesecond sentence kArne is placed after nounrAm (RAm), and hence kArne is consideredparticle.?
Some prepositions or particles are used assuffix if they occur after noun, personalpronoun or verb.
For example,iseh EgiCl.
TF: sihe goisil.ET : Only he went.Actually eh (he : only) is a particle, but it ismerged with the personal pronoun is (si).?
An affix denoting number, gender or person,can be added to an adjective or other categoryword to create a noun word.
For example,xunIyAjnI Eh aAihCA.TF : dhuniyAjoni hoi aAhisA.ET : You are looking beautiful.Here xunIyA (dhuniyA : beautiful) is anadjective, but after adding feminine suffix jnIthe whole constituent becomes a noun word.1TF : Transliterated Assamese Form2ET : Aproximate English Translation?
Even conjunctions can be used as other partof speech.hir aA Ydu vAeyk kkAeyk.TF : Hari aAru Jadu bhAyek kokAyek.ET : Hari and Jadu are brothers.eYAWAkAil rAitr GTnAeTAeW ibFyeTAk aA aixkrhsjnk kir tuilel.TF : JowAkAli rAtir ghotonAtowe bishoitokaAru adhik rahashyajanak kori tulile.ET : The last night incident has made thematter more mysterious.The word aA (aAru : and) shows ambiguityin these two sentences.
In the first, it is usedas conjunction (i.e.
Hari and Jadu) and in thesecond, it is used as adjective of adjective.3 Related WorkSeveral approaches have been used for buildingPOS taggers.
Two main approaches aresupervised and unsupervised.
Both supervised andunsupervised tagging can be of three sub-types.They are rule based, stochastic based and neuralnetwork based.
There are number of pros and consfor each of these methods.
The most commonstochastic tagging technique is Hidden MarkovModel (HMM).During the last twodecades, many different types of taggers have beendeveloped, especially for corpus rich languagessuch as English.
Nevertheless, due to relativelyfree word order, agglutinative nature, lack ofresources and the general lateness in entering thecomputational linguistics field in India, reportedtagger development work on Indian languagesis relatively scanty.
Among reported works,Dandapat (2007) developed a hybrid model ofPOS tagging by combining both supervised andunsupervised stochastic techniques.
Avinesh andKarthik (2007) used conditional random field andtransformation based learning.
The heart of thesystem developed by Singh et al (2006) for Hindiwas the detailed linguistic analysis of morpho-syntactic phenomena, adroit handling of suffixes,accurate verb group identification and learningof disambiguation rules.
Saha et al (2004)developed a system for machine assisted POStagging of Bangla corpora.
Pammi and Prahllad(2007) developed a POS tagger and chunkerusing Decision Forests.
This work exploreddifferent methods for POS tagging of Indianlanguages using sub-words as units.
Generally,most POS taggers for Indian langauages use34morphological analyzer as a module.
However,building morphological analyzer of a particularIndian language is a very difficult task.4 Our ApproachWe have used a Assamese text corpus (CorpusAsm) of nearly 300,000 words from the onlineversion of the Assamese daily Asomiya Pratidin(Sharma et al, 2008).
The downloaded articlesuse a font-based encoding called Luit.
Forour experiments we transliterate the texts to anormalised Roman encoding using transliterationsoftware developed by us.
We manually tag apart of this corpus, Tr, consisting of nearly 10,000words for training.
We use other portions ofCorpus Asm for testing the tagger.There was no tagset for Assamese before westarted the project reported in this paper.
Due tothe morphological richness of the language, manywords of Assamese occur in secondary forms intexts.
This increases the number of POS tagsthat needed for the language.
Also, often thereare differences of opinion among linguists on thetags that may be associated with certain wordsin texts.
We developed a tagset after in-depthconsultation with linguists and manually taggedtext segments of nearly 10,000 words according totheir guidance.
To make the tagging process easierwe have subcategorised each category of nounand personal pronoun based on six case endings(viz, nominative, accussative, instumental, dative,genitive and locative) and two numbers.We have used HMM(Dermatas and Kokkinakis, 1995) and the Viterbialgorithm (1967) in developing our POS tagger.HMM/Viterbi approach is the most useful method,when pretagged corpus is not available.
First, inthe training phase, we have manually tagged theTr part of the corpus using the tagset discussedabove.
Then, we build four database tablesusing probabilities extracted from the manuallytagged corpus- word-probability table, previous-tag-probability table, starting-tag-probability tableand affix-probability table.For testing, we consider three text segments, A,B and C, each of about 1000 words.
First the inputtext is segmented into sentences.
Each sentenceis parsed individually.
Each word of a sentenceis stored in an array.
After that, each word issearched in the word-probability table.
If theword is unknown, its possible affixes are extractedTable 2: POS tagging results with small corpora.Size of training words : 10000, UWH : Unknown wordhandling, UPH : Unknown proper noun handlingTest Size Average UDH UPHset accuracy accuracy accuracyA 992 84.68% 62.8% 42.0%B 1074 89.94% 67.54% 53.96%C 1241 86.05% 85.64% 26.47%Table 3: Comparison of our result with otherHMM based model.Author Language AverageaccuracyToutanova et al(2003) English 97.24%Banko and Moore(2004) English 96.55%Dandapat and Sarkar(2006) Bengali 84.37%Rao et al(2007)Hindi 76.34%Bengali 72.17%Telegu 53.17%Rao and Yarowsky(2007)Hindi 70.67%Bengali 65.47%Telegu 65.85%Sastry et al(2007)Hindi 69.98%Bengali 67.52%Telegu 68.32%Ekbal et al(2007)Hindi 71.65%Bengali 80.63%Telegu 53.15%Ours Assamese 85.64%and searched in the affix-probability table.
Fromthis search, we obtain the probable tags andtheir corresponding probabilities for each word.All these probable tags and the correspondingprobabilities are stored in a two dimensional arraywhich we call the lattice of the sentence.
If wedo not get probable tags and probabilities for acertain word from these two tables we assign tagCN (Common Noun) and probability 1 to theword since occurrence of CN is highest in themanually tagged corpus.
After forming the lattice,the Viterbi algorithm is applied to the lattice thatyields the most probable tag sequence for thatsentence.
After that next sentence is taken and thesame procedure is repeated.5 Experimental EvaluationThe results using the three test segments aresummarised in Table 2.
The evaluation of theresults require intensive manual verification effort.Larger training corpora is likely to produce moreaccurate results.
More reliable results can beobtained using larger test corpora.
Table 3compares our result with other HMM basedreported work.
Form the table it is clear that35Toutanova et al (2003) obtained the best resultfor English (97.24%).
Among HMM basedexperiments reported on Indian languages, wehave obtained the best result (86.89%).
This workis ongoing and the corpus size and the amount oftagged text are being increased on a regular basis.The accuracy of a tagger depends on the size oftagset used, vocabulary used, and size, genre andquality of the corpus used.
Our tagset containing172 tags is rather big compared to other Indianlanguage tagsets.
A smaller tagset is likely togive more accurate result, but may give lessinformation about word structure and ambiguity.The corpora for training and testing our tagger aretaken form an Assamese daily newspaper AsomiyaPratidin, thus they are of the same genre.6 Conclusion & Future workWe have achieved good POS tagging results forAssamese, a fairly widely spoken language whichhad very little prior computational linguistic work.We have obtained an average tagging accuracyof 87% using a training corpus of just 10000words.
Our main achievement is the creation ofthe Assamese tagset that was not available beforestarting this project.
We have implemented anexisting method for POS tagging but our work isfor a new language where an annotated corporaand a pre-defined tagset were not available.We are currently working on developing asmall and more compact tagset.
We proposethe following additional work for improvedperformance.
First, the size of the manuallytagged part of the corpus will have to beincreased.
Second, a suitable procedure forhandling unknown proper nouns will have to bedeveloped.
Third, if this system can be expandedto trigrams or even n-grams using a larger trainingcorpus, we believe that the tagging accuracy willincrease.AcknowledgemntWe would like to thank Dr. Jyotiprakash Tamuli,Dr.
