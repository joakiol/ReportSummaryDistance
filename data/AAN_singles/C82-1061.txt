Academia, 1982QUANTIFICATION OF MEANING AND THE COMPUTERMarie T~i te lov~Czech Language InstituteCzechoslovak Academy of SciencesPragueC.S.S.R.One of the major tasks of the quantitative se-mantic analysis is to disclose complex rela-tions of sememes in communication, i.e.
on thebasis of their associations in the frame of syn-tactic structures.
With the aid of computer itis possible to prepare a corpus of language ma-terial giving the possibi l ity to quantify /I./semantics of syntactic functions, /2./ lexicalmeanings, /3./ meanings of morphological cate-gories, esp.
those of parts of speech, and tocreate a new type of semantic frequency dictio-nary.The assistance of computer in present-day quantitative linguisticstudies makes possible to quantify not only language events, butalso their relations, not only their static features, but alsothe dynamic tendencies of language.
This refers, in the firstplace, to the phenomena of lexicon where the application of quan-titative methods as well as the modern computer processing havebeen of a certain tradition; but the computer-aided research isapplied on other language levels, too, e.g.
in graphemics, pho-nemics, morphemics, and can be performed also in morphology andsyntax.
Thus, the contribution of L. UhliFov& a. collaborators,workers of the Dept.
of Mathematical Linguistics and Phonetics ofthe Czech Language Institute, informed about the computer-aidedquantif ication of patterns of simple, compound, and complex sen-tences and about'their close relationship to the morphological#rid lexical Levels.The resu l t s  ach ieved  in  quant i ta t ive  ana lys i s  s t imu la te  us to  Lakea further step, i.e.

In th is  stage of analysis the computer is an indispen-sable instrument of research.Let us remember in th is  place the th i r t ies  and f i f t ies  of thiscentury when the f i r s t  semantic frequency d ic t ionar ies  of Englishwere - manually - compiled \ [ I \ ] ,  \ [2\] .
They were isolated achieve-ments combining quant i tat ive and qua l i ta t ive  approaches to obtainthe frequency of ind iv idua l  lex ica l  meanings.In the Dept.
of Mathematical L inguist ics and Phonetics, we disposewith a s ta t i s t i ca l  corpus of texts processed by computer the unitsof which /words/ havebeen encoded in context with regard to syn-tax, morphology and lexicon; the corpus provides an adequate basisfor the quant i f icat ion of the so-called context meaning, i .e .meaning in a certain context \[3~.As i t  is known, a discourse is determined by external and internall i ngu is t i c  condit ions, in other words, i t  is a function of l ingu-i s t i c  and ext ra l ingu is t i c  var iables.
The complex relat ions betweenobjects and other events of rea l i ty  are ref lected in language bysyntagmatic and paradigmatic re lat ions ;  to disclose the i r  mutualcondit ioning is one of the major aims of the semantic analysis.The lexicon introducing the sememes within the i r  proper systems isnot capable to cope with the i r  complex re lat ions in the communica-t ion,  and, thus, i t  is necessary to examine the l ink ing of sememesin the frame of syntactic structure.
This is a task which cannotbe done without an assistance ~f computer, especia l ly  when the re-lat ions are to be quant i f ied.
And, at the same time, this  is atask which ought to be performed by the quant i tat ive  l ingu is t i csas a f i r s t  step to the quant i f icat ion of meaning which is today atthe centre of interest  in l ingu is t i cs ,  logic and other sciences.A prerequis i te for obtaining good results in the semantic researchis a computationally processed corpus of l i ngu is t i c  units /sentencetokens/ in which we may quantify:  /1 .
/  semantics of syntacticfunctions, /2 .
/  l ex ica l  meanings by means of which the semanticsof sentence elements are expressed, /3 .
/  meanings of morphologicalcategories, especia l ly  those of parts of speech, when they proveto be of importance for semantics in points /1 .

/ :  I t  i s  we l lQUANTIFICATION OF MEANING AND THE COMPUTER 379known that in spite of a considerable progress in sentence seman-tics in these last years ~4\], \[5\], there is a number of questionsremaining unsolved or open.
Nevertheless, we are able to quantifysemantics on the sentence level applying the principles of L. Tes-nitre \[6\].
The approach consists in searching for semantic compo-nents corresponding to sentence members in different syntacticfunctions.
This is certainly no easy task, but is possible underthe condition that we dispose with a perfectly performed syntacticanalysis of whole sentences /simple, compound, and complex/ andlarger samples of running texts, as is the sampling used inthe Deptoof Mathematical Linguistics for the mentioned corpus of texts.This sort of underlying language material allows us to study thesemantics of language units even larger than a sentence - this,however, being a prospect for a future work.Remarks to point /2./: The study of lexical meanings fixed ~n ex-planatory dictionaries shows some interesting aspects, too.
Theanalysis based on their distr ibution in text and in relation to therespective semantics of syntactic functions gives a new picture ofthe frequency distr ibution of different context meanings associatedwith a word, and, in some cases, even corrects their position withregard to morphological categories.Remarks to point /3./: Each part of speech, of course, "behaves"in a different way as far as the semantics of syntactic functionsand the lexical meanings are concerned; sometimes, the meaning canbe signif icantly influenced also by morphological categories.E.g.
the animate and inanimate genders of masculines in Czech con-cern not only the semantics of the analyzed word, but also its"environment".
So for example, the animateness of subject /e.g.agent/, or object /e.g.
afficient/, is reflected in the verb /pre-dicate/ and also is connected with certain lexical meanings; simi-larly, the verb categories /e.g.
mood and tense/ often influencethe use of lexical meanings as well as the constitution of new mea-nings.These assertions will be now exemplif ied on two fundamental partsof speech, the verb and the noun, which in the quantitative seman-tic analysis manifest some specific features referring to theirpart-of-speech properties and syntactic functions.380 M. TF.SITELOV./~E.g.
the Czech verb in the predicat ive posit ion represents together with i t s  actants the semantic nucleus of sentence.
The actantsare formally expressed by the subject, object and/or adverbials asfree complements.
After the determination of meanings correspon-ding to the syntactic functions of verb as a further step we ascer-tain which of the lex ica l  meanings functions most frequently aspredicate.
The semantics of predicate may be also ingluenced by thepart-of-speech appurtenance of actantsassigned tosyntact ic funct ions .assigned.
I t  cer ta in ly  makes a difference when a subject is ex-pressed by a noun or a pronoun, or when i t  is not expressed at a l l .There are other important aspects, too, e.g.
whether the functionof subject /e.g.
agent/ is expressed by an animate or an inanimatenoun, whether i t  is a human being, animal or thing, whether theword stands in the singular or the plurals whether i t  is p luraletantum etc.
In the re lat ion of object to predicate we must takeinto account the lex ica l  meaning of object and i t s  morphologicalcategories, especial ly case.Between the verb, subject and object there exists a relation of se-mantic congruence, i.e.
a c lassi f icatory agreement of noun and verb/i.e.
of the predicate and its actants/.
E.g.
water, wine flows._.,__~_~_#not so the table, the earth~ we chase the d ~  not ~ .This principle is rather close to the intention of verb in thesense of E. Pauliny \[7\].With the noun in Czech we quantify the semantics correspondingespecial ly to subject, object, attr ibute and adverbial.
Compared tothe previous remarks on the semantic quanti f icat ion of verb we haveto do for the most part with an inverse relation; as a point of de-parture we take now the noun in one of its syntactic functions/with different meanings/ and procede to the verb syntact ical lyfunctioning as a predicate.
Further steps of analysis are practi-cally the same as with the verb, i.e.
the determinat ion of a corres-ponding lexical meaning of the given noun, of its morphological  ca-tegories and/or syntactic functions of i t s  ='environment."
With the,adverbial the attent ion is paid especial ly to whether i t  is obl iga-tory or optional .\[5\].The semantic analysis of the remaining parts of speech in sentence,e.g.
formal words /grammar words/, such as preposit ions and conjunc-tionss have some aspects common with verbs or nouns and, in addition,QUANTIFICATION OF MEANING AND THE COMPUTER 381some special features connected with the i r  status.
