: Classifying Stance in Online DebatePranav Anand, Marilyn Walker, Rob Abbott, Jean E. Fox Tree,Robeson Bowmani, and Michael MinorUniversity of California Santa CruzAbstractA growing body of work has highlighted thechallenges of identifying the stance a speakerholds towards a particular topic, a task that in-volves identifying a holistic subjective dispo-sition.
We examine stance classification ona corpus of 4873 posts across 14 topics onConvinceMe.net, ranging from the playful tothe ideological.
We show that ideological de-bates feature a greater share of rebuttal posts,and that rebuttal posts are significantly harderto classify for stance, for both humans andtrained classifiers.
We also demonstrate thatthe number of subjective expressions variesacross debates, a fact correlated with the per-formance of systems sensitive to sentiment-bearing terms.
We present results for iden-tifing rebuttals with 63% accuracy, and foridentifying stance on a per topic basis thatrange from 54% to 69%, as compared to un-igram baselines that vary between 49% and60%.
Our results suggest that methods thattake into account the dialogic context of suchposts might be fruitful.1 IntroductionRecent work has highlighted the challenges of iden-tifying the STANCE that a speaker holds towards aparticular political, social or technical topic.
Clas-sifying stance involves identifying a holistic subjec-tive disposition, beyond the word or sentence (Linet al, 2006; Malouf and Mullen, 2008; Greene andResnik, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; So-masundaran and Wiebe, 2010).
Our work is inspiredby the large variety of such conversations now freelyavailable online, and our observation that the contex-tual affordances of different debate and discussionwebsites vary a great deal.
One important contex-tual variable, discussed at length below, is the per-centage of posts that are rebuttals to previous posts,which varies in our data from 34% to 80%.
The abil-ity to explicitly rebut a previous post gives these de-bates both monologic and dialogic properties (Biber,1991; Crystal, 2001; Fox Tree, 2010); Compare Fig-ure 1 to Figure 2.
We believe that discussions con-taining many rebuttal links require a different type ofanalysis than other types of debates or discussions.Dialogic Capital PunishmentStudies have shown that using the death penalty saves 4 to 13 livesper execution.
That alone makes killing murderers worthwhile.What studies?
I have never seen ANY evidence that capital pun-ishment acts as a deterrant to crime.
I have not seen any evidencethat it is ?just?
either.When Texas and Florida were executing people one after the otherin the late 90?s, the murder rates in both states plunged, like RosieO?donnel off a diet.. .That?s your evidence?
What happened to those studies?
In thelate 90s a LOT of things were different than the periods precedingand following the one you mention.
We have no way to determinewhat of those contributed to a lower murder rate, if indeed therewas one.
You have to prove a cause and effect relationship andyou have failed.Figure 1: Capital Punishment discussions with postslinked via rebuttal links.This paper utilizes 1113 two-sided debates (4873posts) from Convinceme.net for 14 different debatetopics.
See Table 1.
On Convinceme, a person startsa debate by posting a topic or a question and provid-ing sides such as for vs. against.
Debate participantscan then post arguments for one side or the other, es-sentially self-labelling their post for stance.
Thesedebates may be heated and emotional, discussingweighty issues such as euthanasia and capital pun-ishment, such as the example in Figure 1.
But theyalso appear to be a form of entertainment via playful1debate.
Popular topics on Convinceme.net over thepast 4 years include discussions of the merits of Catsvs.
Dogs, or Pirates vs. Ninjas (almost 1000 posts).See Figure 3.Monologic Capital PunishmentI value human life so much that if someone takes one than hisshould be taken.
Also if someone is thinking about taking a lifethey are less likely to do so knowing that they might lose theirsDeath Penalty is only a costlier version of a lifetime prison sen-tence, bearing the exception that it offers euthanasia to criminalslonging for an easy escape, as opposed to a real punishment.There is no proof that the death penalty acts as a deterrent, plusdue to the finalty of the sentence it would be impossible to amenda mistaken conviction which happens with regualrity especiallynow due to DNA and improved forensic science.Actually most hardened criminals are more afraid to live-then die.I?d like to see life sentences without parole in lieu of capital pun-ishment with hard labor and no amenities for hard core repeatoffenders, the hell with PC and prisoner?s rights-they lose priv-eledges for their behaviour.Figure 2: Posts on the topic Capital punishment withoutexplicit link structure.
The discussion topic was ?DeathPenalty?, and the argument was framed as yes we shouldkeep it vs. no we should not.Our long term goal is to understand the dis-course and dialogic structure of such conversations.This could be useful for: (1) creating automaticsummaries of each position on an issue (Sparck-Jones, 1999); (2) gaining a deeper understandingof what makes an argument persuasive (Marwelland Schmitt, 1967); and (3) identifying the lin-guistic reflexes of perlocutionary acts such as per-suasion and disagreement (Walker, 1996; Greeneand Resnik, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010;Marcu, 2000).
As a first step, in this paper we aimto automatically identify rebuttals, and identify thespeaker?s stance towards a particular topic.Dialogic Cats vs. DogsSince we?re talking much of $hit, then Dogs rule!
Cat poo is ex-tremely foul to one?s nostrils you?ll regret ever handling a cat.Stick with dogs, they?re better for your security, and poo?s not toobad.
Hah!Dog owners seem infatuated with handling sh*t. Cat owners don?tseem to share this infatuation.Not if they?re dog owners who live in the country.
If your dogsh*ts in a field you aren?t going to walk out and pick it up.Cat owners HAVE to handle sh*t, they MUST clean out a litterbox...so suck on that!Figure 3: Cats vs.
Dogs discussions with posts linked byrebuttal links.The most similar work to our own is that of So-masundaran & Wiebe (2009, 2010) who also focuson automatically determining the stance of a debateparticipant with respect to a particular issue.
Theirdata does not provide explicit indicators of dialoguestructure such as are provided by the rebuttal linksin Convinceme.
Thus, this work treats each post asa monologic text to be classified in terms of stance,for a particular topic.
They show that discourse re-lations such as concessions and the identification ofargumentation triggers improves performance oversentiment features alone (Somasundaran and Wiebe,2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010).
This work,along with others, indicates that for such tasks it isdifficult to beat a unigram baseline (Pang and Lee,2008).Other similar related work analyzes Usenet forumquote/response structures (Wang and Rose?, 2010).We believe quote/response pairs have a similar dis-course structure to the rebuttal post pairs in Con-vinceme, but perhaps with the linguistic reflexesof stance expressed even more locally.
Howeveragreement vs. disagreement is not labelled acrossquote/response pairs and Wang & Rose (2010) donot attempt to distinguish these different discourserelations.
Rather they show that they can use a vari-ant of LSA to identify a parent post, given a responsepost, with approximately 70% accuracy.
A recentpaper by (Abbott et al, 2011) examines agreementand disagreement in quote/response pairs in idealog-ical and nonidealogical online forum discussions,and shows that you can distinguish the agreementrelation with 68% accuracy.
Their results indicatethat contextual features do improve performance foridentifying the agreement relation between quotesand responses.Other work has utilized the social network struc-ture of online forums, either with or without tex-tual features of particular posts (Malouf and Mullen,2008; Mishne and Glance, 2006; Murakami andRaymond, 2010; Agrawal et al, 2003).
Howeverthis work does not examine the way that the dia-logic structure varies by topic, as we do, and thethreading structure of their debates does not dis-tinguish between agreement and disagreement re-sponses.
(Mishne and Glance, 2006) show that mostreplies to blog posts are disagreements, while Agar-wal?s work assumed that adjacent posts always dis-agree, and did not use any of the information in thetext.
Murakami & Raymond (2010) show that sim-ple rules for identifying disagreement, defined onthe textual content of the post, can improve overAgarwal?s results and (Malouf and Mullen, 2008)show that a combination of textual and social net-2work features provides the best performance.
Weleave the incorporation of social network informa-tion for stance classification to future work.Section 3 discusses our corpus in more detail, andpresents the results of a human debate-side classi-fication task conducted on Mechanical Turk.
Sec-tion 3 describes two different machine learning ex-periments: one for identifying rebuttals and the otherfor automatically determining stance.
Section 4presents our results.
We show that we can iden-tify rebuttals with 63% accuracy, and that using sen-timent, subjectivity and dialogic features, we canachieve debate-side classification accuracies, on aper topic basis, that range from 54% to 69%, as com-pared to unigram baselines that vary between 49%and 60%.2 Corpus Description and AnalysisTable 1 provides an overview of our corpus.
Ourcorpus consists of 1113 two-sided debates (4873posts) from Convinceme.net for 12 topics rangingfrom playful debates such as Cats vs.
Dogs to moreheated political topics such as Capital Punishment.In Table 1, the topics above the line are either tech-nical or playful, while the topics below the line areideological.
In total the corpus consists of 2,722,340words; the topic labeled debates which we use in ourexperiments contain 507,827 words.Convinceme provides three possible sources ofdialogic structure: (1) the SIDE that a post is placedon indicates the poster?s stance with respect to theoriginal debate topic, and thus can be considered as aresponse to that post; (2) REBUTTAL LINKS betweenposts which are explicitly indicated by the poster us-ing the affordances of the site; and (3) the TEMPO-RAL CONTEXT of the debate, i.e.
the state of thedebate at a particular point in time, which a debateparticipant orients to in framing their post.Topics vary a great deal in terms of their dialogicstructure and linguistic expression.
In Table 1, thecolumns providing counts for different variables areselected to illustrate ways in which topics differ inthe form and style of the argument and in its sub-jective content.
One important variable is the per-centage of the topic posts that are linked into a re-buttal dialogic structure (Rebuttals).
Some of thesedifferences can be observed by comparing the dia-logic and monologic posts for the Capital Punish-ment topic in Figures 1 and 2 to those for the Catsvs.
Dogs topic in Figures 3 and 4.
IdeologicalMonologic Cats vs. DogsFirst of all, cats are about a thousand times easier to care for.You don?t have to walk them or bathe them because they?re smartenough to figure out all that stuff on their own.
Plus, they have thecommon courtesy to do their business in the litter box, instead ofall over your house and yard.
Just one of the many reasons catsrule and dogs, quite literally drool!Say, you had a bad day at work, or a bad breakup, you just wannago home and cry.
A cat would just look at you like ?oh ok, you?rehome?
and then walk away.
A dog?
Let?s see, the dog would mostlikely wiggle its tail, with tongue sticking out and head tilted - the?you?re home!
i missed you so much, let?s go snuggle in front ofthe TV and eat ice-cream?
look.
What more do I need to say?Figure 4: Posts on the topic Cats vs.
Dogs without ex-plicit rebuttal links.topics display more author investment; people feelmore strongly about these issues.
This is shown bythe fact that there are more rebuttals per topic andmore posts per author (P/A) in the topics below theline in Table 1.
It follows that these topics have amuch higher degree of context-dependence in eachpost, since posts respond directly to the parent post.Rebuttals exhibit more markers of dialogic interac-tion: greater pronominalization (especially you aswell as propositional anaphora such as that and it),ellipsis, and dialogic cue words; Figure 5 shows thedifference in counts of ?you?
between rebuttals andnon-rebuttals (Rebuttals x?
= 9.6 and Non-Rebuttalsx?
= 8.5, t(27) = 24.94, p < .001).
Another indi-cation of author investment is the percentage of au-thors with more than one post (A > 1P).
Post Length(PL), on the other hand, is not significantly corre-lated with degree of investment in the topic.Figure 5: Kernel density estimates for ?you?

For exam-ple, Table 1 shows that discussions about Cats vs.Dogs consist of short simple words in short sen-tences with relatively high usage of positive emo-tion words and pronouns, whereas 2nd amendmentdebates use relatively longer sentences, and deathpenalty debates (unsurprisingly) use a lot of nega-tive emotion words.Human Topline.
The best performance for sid-ing ideological debates in previous work is approx-imately 64% accuracy over all topics, for a collec-tion of 2nd Amendment, Abortion, Evolution, andGay Rights debate posts (Somasundaran and Wiebe,2010).
Their best performance is 70% for the 2ndamendment topic.
The website that these posts werecollected from apparently did not support dialogicthreading, and thus there are no explicitly linked re-buttals in this data set.
Given the dialogic natureof our data, as indicated by the high percentage ofrebuttals in the ideological debates, we first aim todetermine how difficult it is for humans to side anindividual post from a debate without context.
Toour knowledge, none of the previous work on de-bate side classification has attempted to establish ahuman topline.We set up a Mechanical Turk task by randomly se-lected a subset of our data excluding the first post oneach side of a debate and debates with fewer than 6posts on either side.
Each of our 12 topics consists ofmore than one debate: each debate was mapped byhand to the topic and topic-siding (as in (Somasun-daran and Wiebe, 2010)).
We selected equal num-bers of posts for each topic for each side, and cre-ated 132 tasks (Mechanical Turk HITs).
Each HITconsisted of choosing the correct side for 10 postsdivided evenly, and selected randomly without re-placement, from two debates.
For each debate wepresented a title, side labels, and the initial post oneach side.
For each post we presented the first 155characters with a SEE MORE button which expandedthe post to its full length.
Each HIT was judged by 9annotators using Mechanical Turk with each anno-tator restricted to at most 30 HITS (300 judgments).Since many topics were US specific and we wantedannotators with a good grasp of English, we requiredTurkers to have a US IP address.Figure 6 plots the number of annotators over alltopics who selected the ?true siding?
as the side thatthe post was on.
We defined ?true siding?
for thispurpose as the side that the original poster placedtheir post.
Figure 6 illustrates that humans oftenplaced the post on the wrong side.
The majority ofposters agreed with the true siding 78.26% of thetime.
The Fleiss?
kappa statistic was 0.2656.Importantly and interestingly, annotator accuracyvaried across topics in line with rebuttal percentage.Annotators correctly labeled 94 of 100 posts for Catsvs.

This suggests that posts maybe difficult to side without context, which is whatone might expect given their dialogic nature.
Rebut-tals were clearly harder to side: annotators correctlysided non-rebuttals 87% of the time, but only man-aged 73% accuracy for rebuttals.
Since all of the lessserious topics consisted of ?50% rebuttals while allof the more serious ideological debates had >50%rebuttals, 76% of ideological posts were sided cor-rectly, while 85% of non-ideological posts were cor-rectly sided.
See Table 2.Class Correct Total AccuracyRebuttal 606 827 0.73Non-Rebuttal 427 493 0.87Table 2: Human Agreement on Rebuttal ClassificationLooking at the data by hand revealed that whennearly all annotators agreed with each other but dis-agreed with the self-labeled side, the user posted onthe wrong side (either due to user error, or becausethe user was rebutting an argument the parent postraised, not the actual conclusion).The difficult-to-classify posts (where only 4-6 an-notators were correct) were more complex.
Ouranalysis suggests that in 28% of these cases, the an-notators were simply wrong, perhaps only skimminga post when the stance indicator was buried deep in-side it.
Our decision to show only the first 155 char-acters of each post by default (with a SHOW MOREbutton) may have contributed to this error.
An ad-ditional 39% were short comments or ad hominemresponses, that showed disagreement, but no indi-cation of side and 17% were ambiguous out of con-text.
A remaining 10% were meta-debate comments,either about whether there were only two sides, orwhether the argument was meaningful.
Given thedifferences in siding difficulty depending on rebut-tal status, in Section 4 we present results for bothrebuttal and stance classification.3 Features and Learning MethodsOur experiments were conducted with the Wekatoolkit.
All results are from 10 fold cross-validationon a balanced test set.
In the hand examination ofannotators siding performance, 101 posts were de-termined to have incorrect self-labeling for side.
Weeliminated these posts and their descendants fromthe experiments detailed below.
This resulted in adataset of 4772 posts.
We used two classifiers withdifferent properties: NaiveBayes and JRip.
JRip isa rule based classifier which produces a compactmodel suitable for human consumption and quickapplication.
Table 3 provides a summary of the fea-tures we extract for each post.
We describe and mo-tivate these feature sets below.Set Description/ExamplesPost Info IsRebuttal, PosterUnigrams Word frequenciesBigrams Word pair frequenciesCue Words Initial unigram, bigram, and trigramRepeatedPunctuationCollapsed into one of the following: ?

Previous worksuggests that the unigram baseline can be difficult tobeat for certain types of debates (Somasundaran andWiebe, 2010).
Thus we derived both unigrams andbigrams as features.
We also include basic countssuch as post length.Cue Words.
We represent each posts initial un-igram, bigram and trigram sequences to capture theuseage of cue words to mark responses of particulartype, such as oh really, so, and well; these featureswere based on both previous work and our exami-nation of the corpus (Fox Tree and Schrock, 1999;Fox Tree and Schrock, 2002; Groen et al, 2010).5Repeated Punctuation.
Our informal analysessuggested that repeated sequential use of particulartypes of punctuation such as !!
and ??
did not meanthe same thing as simple counts or frequencies ofpunctuation across a whole post.
Thus we developeddistinct features for a subset of these repetitions.LIWC.
We also derived features using the Lin-guistics Inquiry Word Count tool (LIWC-2001)(Pennebaker et al, 2001).
LIWC provides meta-level conceptual categories for words to use in wordcounts.
Some LIWC features that we expect to beimportant are words per sentence (WPS), pronomi-nal forms (Pro), and positive and negative emotionwords (PosE) and (NegE).
See Table 1.Syntactic Dependency.
Previous research inthis area suggests the utility of dependency struc-ture to determine the TARGET of an opinion word(Joshi and Penstein-Rose?, 2009; Somasundaran andWiebe, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010).
Thedependency parse for a given sentence is a set oftriples, composed of a grammatical relation and thepair of words for which the grammatical relationholds (reli, wj , wk), where reli is the dependencyrelation among words wj and wk.
The word wj isthe HEAD of the dependency relation.
We use theStanford parser to parse the utterances in the postsand extract dependency features (De Marneffe et al,2006; Klein and Manning, 2003).Generalized Dependency.
To create generalizeddependencies, we ?back off?
the head word in eachof the above features to its part-of-speech tag (Joshiand Penstein-Rose?, 2009).
Joshi & Rose?s resultssuggested that this approach would work better thaneither fully lexicalized or fully generalized depen-dency features.
We call these POS generalized de-pendencies in the results below.Opinion Dependencies.
Somasundaran & Wiebe(2009) introduced features that identify the TAR-GET of opinion words.
Inspired by this approach,we used the MPQA dictionary of opinion wordsto select the subset of dependency and generalizeddependency features in which those opinion wordsappear.
For these features we replace the opinionwords with their positive or negative polarity equiv-alents (Lin et al, 2006).Context Features.
Given the difficulty annota-tors had in reliably siding rebuttals as well as theirprevalence in the corpus, we hypothesize that fea-tures representing the parent post could be helpfulfor classification.
Here, we use a naive represen-tation of context, where for all the feature types inTable 3, we construct both parent features and postfeatures.
For top-level parentless posts, the parentfeatures were null.Figure 7: Model for distinguishing rebuttals vs. nonre-buttals across all topics.4 ResultsThe primary aim of our experiments was to deter-mine the potential contribution, to debate side clas-sification performance, of contextual dialogue fea-tures, such as linguistic reflexes indicating a poster?sorientation to a previous post or information from aparent post.
Because we believed that identificationof whether a post is a rebuttal or not might be help-ful in the long term for debate-side classification, wealso establish a baseline for rebuttal classification.4.1 Rebuttal Classification ResultsThe differences in human performance for siding de-pended on rebuttal status.
Our experiments on re-buttal classification using the rule-based JRip clas-sifer on a 10-fold cross-validation of our dataset pro-6duced 63% accuracy.
Figure 7 illustrates a samplemodel learned for distinguishing rebuttals from non-rebuttals across all topics.
The Figure shows that,although we used the full complement of lexical andsyntactic features detailed above, the learned ruleswere almost entirely based on LIWC and unigramlexical features, such as 2nd person pronouns (7/8rules), quotation marks (4/8 rules), question marks(3/8), and negation (4/8), all of which correlatedwith rebuttals.
Other features that are used at severalplaces in the tree are LIWC Social Processes, LIWCreferences to people, and LIWC Inclusive and Ex-clusive.
One tree node reflects the particular concernwith bodily functions that characterizes the Cats vs.Dogs debate as illustrated in Figure 3.4.2 Automatic Debate-Side ClassificationResultsWe first compared accuracies using Naive Bayes toJRip for all topics for all feature sets.
A paired t-testshowed that Naive Bayes over all topics and featuresets was consistently better than JRip (p < .0001).Thus the rest of our analysis and the results in Ta-ble 4 focus on the Naive Bayes results.Table 4 presents results for automatic debateside classification using different feature sets and theNaive Bayes learner which performs best over alltopics.
In addition to classifying using only post-internal features, we ran a parallel set of experimentsadding contextual features representing the parentpost, as described in Section 3.
The results in Table4 are divided under the headers Without Context andWith Context depending on whether features fromthe parent post were used if it existed (e.g.
in thecase of rebuttals).We conducted paired t-tests over all topics simul-taneously to examine the utility of different featuresets.
We compared unigrams to LIWC, opinion gen-eralized dependencies, POS generalized dependen-cies, and all features.
We also compared experi-ments using context features to experiments usingno contextual features.
In general, our results in-dicate that if the data are aggregated over all top-ics, that indeed it is very difficult to beat the uni-gram baseline.
Across all topics there are generallyno significant differences between experiments con-ducted with unigrams and other features.
The meanaccuracies across all topics for unigrams vs. LIWCfeatures was 54.35% for unigrams vs. 52.83% forLIWC.
The mean accuracies for unigram vs POSgeneralized dependencies was 54.35% vs. 52.64%,and for unigrams vs. all features was Unigram54.35% vs 54.62%.
The opinion generalized de-pendencies features actually performed significantlyworse than unigrams with an accuracy of 49% vs.54.35% (p < .0001).It is interesting to note that in general the unigramaccuracies are significantly below what Somasun-daran and Wiebe achieve (who report overall uni-gram of 62.5%).
This suggests a difference betweenthe debate posts in their corpus and the Convincemedata we used which may be related to the proportionof rebuttals.The overal lack of impact for either the POS gen-eralized dependency features (GDepP) or the Opin-ion generalized dependency features (GDep0) issurprising given that they improve accuracy for othersimilar tasks (Joshi and Penstein-Rose?, 2009; Soma-sundaran and Wiebe, 2010).
While our method ofextracting the GDepP features is identical to (Joshiand Penstein-Rose?, 2009), our method for extractingGDepO is an approximation of the method of (So-masundaran and Wiebe, 2010), that does not rely onselecting particular patterns indicating the topics ofarguing by using a development set.The LIWC feature set, which is based on a lexi-cal hierarchy that includes social features, negativeand positive emotion, and psychological processes,is the only feature set that appears to have the po-tential to systematically show improvement over agood range of topics.
We believe that further analy-sis is needed; we do not want to handpick topics forwhich particular feature sets perform well.Our results also showed that context did not seemto help uniformly over all topics.
The mean per-formance over all topics for contextual features us-ing the combination of all features and the NaiveBayes learner was 53.0% for context and 54.62%for no context (p = .15%, not significant).
Interest-ing, the use of contextual features provided surpris-ingly greater performance for particular topics.
Forexample for 2nd Amendment, unigrams with con-text yield a performance of 69.23% as opposed tothe best performing without context features usingLIWC of 64.10%.
The best performance of (So-masundaran and Wiebe, 2010) is also 70% for the2nd amendment topic.

KEY: Human topline results(Turk).
Unigram features (Uni).
Linguistics Inquiry Word Count features (LIWC).
Generalized dependency featurescontaining MPQA terms (GdepO) & POS tags (GdepP).
NaiveBayes was used, no attribute selection was applied.below the majority class baseline for all of the fea-tures without context.Should we conclude anything from the fact that6 of the topics are idealogical, out of the 7 topicswhere contextual features provide the best perfor-mance?
We believe that the significantly greater per-centage of rebuttals for these topics should give agreater weight to contextual features, so it would beuseful to examine stance classification performanceon the subset of the posts that are rebuttals.
We be-lieve that context is important; our conclusion is thatour current contextual features are naive ?
they arenot capturing the relationship between a post and aparent post.
Sequential models or at least better con-textual features are needed.The fact that we should be able to do much betteris indicated clearly by the human topline, shown inthe column labelled Turk in Table 4.
Even withoutcontext, and with the difficulties siding rebuttals, thehuman annotators achieve accuracies ranging from66% to 94%.5 DiscussionThis paper examines two problems in online-debates: rebuttal classification and debate-side orstance classification.
Our results show that we canidentify rebuttals with 63% accuracy, and that usinglexical and contextual features such as those fromLIWC, we can achieve debate-side classification ac-curacies on a per topic basis that range from 54% to69%, as compared to a unigram baselines that varybetween 49% and 60%.
These are the first resultsthat we are aware of that establish a human toplinefor debate side classification.
These are also the firstresults that we know of for identifying rebuttals insuch debates.Our results for stance classification are mixed.While we show that for many topics we can beata unigram baseline given more intelligent features,we do not beat the unigram baseline when we com-bine our data across all topics.
In addition, we arenot able to show across all topics that our contex-tual features make a difference, though clearly use ofcontext should make a difference in understandingthese debates, and for particular topics, classifica-tion results using context are far better than the bestfeature set without any contextual features.
In fu-ture work, we hope to develop more intelligent fea-tures for representing context and improve on theseresults.
We also plan to make our corpus availableto other researchers in the hopes that it will stimu-late further work analyzing the dialogic structure ofsuch debates.AcknowledgmentsThis work was funded by Grant NPS-BAA-03 toUCSC and Intelligence Advanced Research ProjectsActivity (IARPA) through the Army Research Lab-oratory to UCSC by subcontract from the Universityof Maryland.
