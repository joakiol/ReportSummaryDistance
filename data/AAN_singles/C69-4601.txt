AbstractA computer program for automatic identification of "full-form" case citations in legal literature (e.g., Rutherford v. Geddes,4 Wall.
220, 18 L. Ed.
343; Southland Industries, Incorporated v.Federal Cc~mmlnications Ccm~nlssion, 1938, 69 App.
D.C., 82, 99 Fo2D 117) has been developed at the University of Pittsburgh and isnow operational.The level of performance of this program known as "TheCitation Identifier" is high.
In a recent computer run, ~aeCitation Identifier scanned the full texts of 191 randomly select-ed decisions of U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400, 000 words of run-ning text) and located correctly 2,220 full-form citations out ofa total of 2, 227 (that is better than 99% of the total).
Onlyseven misses and three false drops occurred.Of 2, 220 full-form citations which were located correct-ly, 1944 (87%) were identified perfectly.
In addition, therewere 276 partial identifications containing two types of errors :(1) partial identifications in which some citation terms weremistakenly lopped off by the program (so-called "short hits"), and(2) partial identifications which contained words that were im-properly included in the citations (so-called "long hits").Both types of errors are for the most part easily cor-rectable and can be largely eliminated by suitable changes in theprogram.-1-The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.
In arecent test run, the total time required to process some 400, 000running words of t~xt was approximately fifteen and a halfminutes.
This speed could be further increased by suitablechanges in the cc~uter program.An extension of the Citation Identifier to reduced-formcitations (e.g., "The Geddes decision," "the Southland Industriesease") is no~ in preparation.Motivation for Automatic Identification of Case Citations in LegalLiterature.Efficient administration of justice has often beenhampered by the slowness ~nd inefficiency of ordinary methods oflegal information h~dling.Because lawyers, judges, government attorneys, legisla-tors, and others find access to necessary legal data often slow andinefficient, they are frequently unable to act with the speed andthe effectiveness which the circumstances may demand of them.
Thus,for example, members of the legal profession are often unable toprocure, promptly, exhaustive and accurate data concerning legalprecedents of various court decisions.
This has often hampered theinitiation of legal actions, slOWed down the preparation of de-fense and offense, delayed the preparation of new laWs, and other-Wise interfered with the efficiency of legal processes.However, wise automation of certain critical areas oflegal information processing could alleviate considerably thepresent crisis in legal documentation.
For example, a set of-2-comber  progrs~s capable of exhaustive, accurate, rapid, andeconomical identificatio~ of legal precedents in legal literaturewould do ~ch to eliminate f r~ legal documentation one of itsmost serious bottlenecks.Since many or most legal precedents are referred to inlegal literature by means of full-form and reduced-form case ci-tatiens, (e. g., respectively, '~ealy v. Penna.
RR.
Co., supra"and '~he Healy case"), antc~atic identification of both forms ofcase citations would go far in the direction of automatic identi-fication of leg~l precedents in legal literature.However, a perusal of legal texts shows that automaticidentification of full-form citations is both ~ch simpler thanthat of reduced-form citations and also a prerequisite for effi-cient identification of the latter.Therefore, construction of a set of programs for auto-rustic identification of legal precedents in legal literature hasbegun with the construction of a computer progrma for automaticidentification in legal texts of full-fc~m legal citations.State of the Art and the Genesis of The Citation Identifier.Practical work in legal aut~t ie  information retrievalhas until now revolved mainly around: (I) the preparation ofco~cords~ces to legal te~ts, (2) EWIC indexin 8 of legal texts,and (3) matching of legal texts with the key terms of queries andinte~eet profiles.
These well-establishe~ automatic informationretrieval activities have met with considerable success.
1'2"3 -  ?In additioa, a sizable ~mount of time and energy hasbeen devoted to automatic construction frc~ computer-readablelegal texts of legal indexes and legal thesauri by means ofvarious statistical techniques.
3' 4 However, to the best of ourknowledge, these interesting procedures have not been incorporatedinto any practical legal information systems.No previous attempts at autcm~tic identification ofcase names in legal texts have c~ne to our attention; however,this general type of activity has been extensively discussed byCasimir Borkowsi and derives directly from his efforts sdmed atautomatic identification in texts of classes of words and of wordStrings referring to various types of individuals, objects, pro-cesses, acts, relaticas, groups, etc.
5, 6, 7, 8, 9The Citation Identifier was first undertaken byBorkowski and his students in the Department of Cc~puter Scienceof the University of Pittsburgh, in early 1968 as part of a work-shop section of a graduate course in automatic text processing.Research and development procedures adapted by Borkowski and hisgroup were approximately as follows :A set of challenging but nevertheless resolvBble problemsin automatic text processing w~s presented to the class, discussed,and resolved in a general way.
A detailed solution of one of theprobl~ns, namely, automatic identification of full-form caseJcitations, w~s then worked out, flowcharted and programmed in ahigh-level p rogra~ language (PENELOPE) I0 for the IBM 360/50computer of the University of Pittsburgh.Computer-readable legal texts were made available tothe class by Aspen Systems Corporation (formerly, the HealthLaw Center of the University of Pittsburgh)~ and both theteacher and the students want to take this opportunity to thankAspen Systems for these data.Since the termination of the original classroom work-shop project, The Citation Identifier was reprogrsamed in 0S/360assembly lauguage for Aspen's IBM 360/40 by Sperling Martin s oneof the students, who is also with Aspen Systems Corporation.The effectiveness of this recent version of TheCitation Identifier constitutes, along with an outline of itspresent structure, the subject matter of this paper.Structure of The Citation IdentifierOur rules for automatic identification of citations areessentially simple.
Full-form case citations in legal texts arerecognized by means of s straightforward identification procedurewhose main steps are listed below:1.
Copy a sentence from a computer-readable document into anarea in computer memory (hereafter, "the Search Ares").
Then 2starting at the beginning of the Search Area.2.
Search the text from left to right for an occurrence of"v. ".
NOTE: The presence of "v. " (for "versus") within a sen-tence is taken to indicate the presence in that sentence of afull-form case citation.3.
(A) If "v." is not found, return to 1. above for nextinstruction.-5-(B) If "v." is found, record its Search Area locationand go to #.
below for next instruction.4.
Starting at the location of "v. " search the sentence fromright to left for the first occurrence of a string of characterswhich m~tches either :(A) A string of characters which is on a list of so-called"Left Delimiters of a Case Citation" (hereafter, "LD")(see NOTE i. below),or else(B) A string of characters which is on a llst of so-called'potential Left Delimiters of a Case Citation" (hereafter,'~LD") (see NOTE 2. below)?NOTE l: Entries on LD list (of which there are approximstelyone hundred) are: (a) words such as: "also", "although", "cites","cited", "in", "note", "see" 3 "since", "when", etc., (b) abbrevia-tions such as: "c?f.
", "e.g.
", "ViZo" etc.
3 and (c) punctuationm~rks such as: colon, semicolon, sentence period (i.e.
a periodfollowed by two or more spaces), a question m~rk, etc.NOTE 2: The only two entries on PLD llst are the word "of" andthe ccmm~ punctuation mark.5.
(A) If the character string to the left of "v." was mstch-ed by an entry on LD llst, then:(a) flag as the beginning of tke case citation thefirst word to the right of that character string,(b) return to the location of "v." in the Search Area,4 -(c) go to 9- belov far the next instruction.I~0TE: The first occurrence of a string of characters to theleft of '~."
which m~tches an entry on Left Delimiters List isinterpreted as the first element outside the case citation.
Inother words, we seek to locate the first occurrence of a stringof characters Vhich is net within the well-formed formula forthe "left me~aber" of a i~O_l-fo~m case citatio~ or -- to put ityet another way -- we are on the lookout for the first stringof characters which is in the cc~Ixlement of the set of all formu-las for the left ~ers  of c~se citations.
(B) If the chezacte~ string to the left of "v." was match-ed by an entry on P~D list, go to 6. below.6.
(A) If the chs~acter string in the sentence was matched bythe entry "of" on PT~ list, then (a) note its location in thesentence, and (b) check whether the text word which is to itsimmediate left is m~tched by an entry on the list of so-called"Resolvers i" (see ~ i. below) and go to 7. below for thenext instruction.
(B) If the ~cter  in the sentence was m~tched by theentry "," (i.e.
a c~)  on PLD list, then check whetherthe text word which is to its immediate right is on thelist of so-called '~esolvers 2" (see NOTE 2. below) and goto 8. below for the next instruction.ROTE i: List of Resolvers i contains words such as "authority","citation", "l~w", "rea~onlng", "rule", etc.2: List of Resolvers 2 contains words such as "Incorporated"-7-and "Limited", abbreviations such as "Inc. "3 and "Ltd. ", andabbreviations of names of states : "Ariz. "3 "Ark.
"3 "cal.
", etc.7.
If the string of characters in text was matched by an entry?
on List of Resolvers 13 then:(A) (a) flag as the beginning of case citation the firstword to the right of the word "of" 3(b) return to the location of "v? "
in the Search Area,(c) go to 9. below for the next instruction;otherwise(B) Starting at the location of the ccsmm, continue exe-cuting the instruction 4. above.8.
(A) If the string of characters in text Was not matchedby an entry on List of Resolvers 2, then:(a) flag as the beginning of case citation the firstword to the right of the comma,(b) return to the location of "v. " in the Search Area,(c) go to 9. below for the next instruction;otherwise(B) Starting at the location of the contain 3 continue exe-cuting the instruction 4. above.9- Starting at the location of "v. " search the sentence fromleft to right for either:(A) The first occurrence of a sentence period 3or(B) A string of characters which is a number,or-8-W(C) A string of characters which matches an entry on thelist of so-called '~Bibliography Terms" (hereafter, '~T")(see NOTE i. below).NOTE i: Entries on BT list (of Which there are approximatelyone hundred ~nd fifty) are:(A) Words sad phrases such as: "affirmed" 3 "ante~ "atp84~e" 3 "certoriemi denied" 3 "certoriari granted" 3 "Docket" 3"infra" 3 "super" 3 "supra" 3 etc.

"3 etc.,and the names of states referred to in 6. above.NOTE 2: During this part of the program~ an aut(~nation is madeto scan the "right member" of the citation to check its well-formedness.
During this scan, we are on the lookout for allstrings which are in the set of well-formed formulas for rightmembers of full-form citations.
The right boundary marker ispl~ced to the left of the first character string which is believednot to be part of the well-formed formula for the right member.i0.
(A) If the sentence period is encountered, then(a) flag as the end of the citation the string ofcharacters to its immediate left,(b) print the citation and go to 1. above for thenext instruction.
(B) If a string of characters in the text was eitheridentified as a number or else was matched by an entry onBT list, then go to ll.
below for the next instruction.-9-ll.
Continue searching the text from left to right for eitherthe first occurrence of the sentence period or a string ofcharacters which matches an entry on BT list.12.
(A) If a sentence period is encountered, go to lO.
(A)(a) above for the next instruction.
(B) if the string of characters in the text was eitheridentified as a number or was matched by an entry on BTlist, then continue executing ll.
above;otherwise(a) flag as the last element of the case citation~the word to the left of that chs~acter string,(b) print the citation,(c) remain at present location in the Search Area andgo to 2. above for the next instruction.Effectiveness of The Citation IdentifierThe assembly language version of The Citation Identifieras reported here was developed and tested out on Aspen Syst~nsCorporation's ISM 360/40.
Legal texts used in the test were thedecisions of the United States Court of Appeals (Third Circuit).In a recent computer run, The Citation Identifier scan-ned 191 randomly selected court decisions (45, 942 lines of texts,that is some 400,000 words of running text) and.located correct-ly 2, 220 full-form citations out of a total of 2, 227 (that isbetter than 99% of the total).Of 2, 220 full-form citations which were located correct-ly, l~ 9~J4 (87%) were identified Perfectly.
In addition, there-lO-IIwere 276 partial identifications containing two types of errors :i.
"Short hits"~ i.e.
full-form case citations in which somecitation terms were mists~enly lopped off by the program~ Thens~ber of such l~rtial identifications was 208 (e.g., "Carlinov.
Zimblarte~ 15~7, 60" for "Carlino v. Zimblarte, 1927, 60Ontario Law ~e~a~s 269"),and2.
"Long hits", i.e.
i~Lll-form case citations which containedterms which were imprOl~rly included in the citations.
Thenumber of such partially c~rect  identifications was 82 (e.g.,"Gulf v. Schlumberger ~ is an ordinary civil action").The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.
Thetotal time required to process over 400, 000 running words oftext and print out 2~220 full-form citations was appraximatelyfifteen and one half minutes.-ii-TABLE IResults of the ExperimentIt~n: Number :Full-text documents in the sample ........................ 191Running words of texts ........................ over 400, 000Full-form case citations in the sample .................. 2, 227Full-form case citations located correctly .............. 2,220Full-form case citations missed ............................. 7False drops ................................................. 3Perfect identifications ................................. l, 944Partial identifications ................................... 276*Short hits ................................................ 208Long hits .................................................. 82Job time (in minutes) ........................ under 16Of 276 partial Identifications~ * 31 were caused bytypographic errors; 18 and l~O, respectively, were due to lackof appropriate entries on the lists of Left Delimiters andBibliographic Terms, and 9 and 12, respectively, to lack of en-tries on Resolvers 1 and Resolvers 2 lists.
The misses, falsedrops, and the remainder of partial identifications (apprc~imate-ly 75) were caused by various incorrect assumptions incorporatedI* Because some partial hits contained both short and long hits sthe total of short hits and long hits is greater th~n the numberof partial identifications.into the basic identlfic~tion routines.
Thus~ for example, theassumption that all right members of full-form citations terminatein strings of numbers and bibliographic terms has caused sevenmisses 8~1d nineteen long hits (e.g., the following string ofwords was identified as a single citation, '~cCullough v.Cosgrave cited its previous opinion in Los Angeles Brush Corp. v.James, 1927, 272 U.S. 701").Similarly~ the assumption that the presence of "v. "in a sentence indicates the presence in that sentence of a full-form case citation resulted in false drops such as: "C. L.McClain Fuel Corp. v. appellsmt's contention that the case atbar fe/_Is within this testimony".Sone changes in the structure of the main identifica-tion procedure are noW in l~relma-ati~.
A preliminary evaluationindicated that they should lead to further significant improve-ments in the accuracy and the speed of the program.
A preliminaryevaluation indicates that by increasing the number of list entriesby about a factor of four, we would reduce the number of partialhits by about a factor of three.
Among required neW entries ~fnichwill be added to the list are: frequently mispelled words andabbreviatlons~ left delimiters, bibliographic terms, etc.We would estim~te that the introduction into The CitationIdentifier of all modifications suggested above would reduce bya factor of five or six the number of partial identifications.--13-JDiscussion and Inter~pretationWe would like to emphaize the fact that the task whichWe set for ourselves was the solution of a ~ practical~oblem.
Consequently, we did not think it appropriate to commitourselves to any strong theoretical view of ordinary language andsought instead to discover what minimal assumptions and what in-formation may be pertinent to our unprepossessing experiments inautomatic text processing.Simple~ hypotheses Concerning automatic identificationin texts of case citations were selected by us with the intentionof finding out how many correct identifications and how manyerrors they would produce.
It was and it r~nains our plan toamend these hypotheses on a continuous basis in the light of theresults obtained.
We are, of course, striving for strongertheoretical underpinnings; however, for the time being, we findit appropriate to operate with the least s~ount of preconceivedopinion and of theoretical commitment.Automatic classification of words and phrases in textsof the type described here can be viewed as a particularly simplecase of machine translation fr~n ordinary language.
However, thegoal of The Citation Identifier is not translation into naturallanguage but into classificatory language.
In other words, ourprogram attempts a relatively simple many-tp-one type of reduction(i. e. classification) rather than the extremely ccmplex many-to-many transformation of the '~T" type.More generally , it may be useful to view ordinarylanguage as a macro-language containing certain special-purposemlcro-languages (or '~ini-lsaguages") -- each with its own struc-ture which relative to the total structure of language is quitesimple.
It may be of considerable practical and theoreticalinterest (a) to investigate the structures and the interrela-tions of such mini-languages and (b) to construct computer pro-grams for identifying in te~ts the words and the word stringsbelonging to such mini-languages.An ability to produce and identify autc~atlcslly wordsand word strings belonging to various speclal-purpose categories(i. e. mini-languages, each with its own set of gre~n,atlcal rules)should be very useful in information retrieval because they playan important role in various systems for extracting and dlstribut ~-ing information.Because many word strings which the algorithms such asthis one attempt to identify have simple structure ("phrase:structure"), they can be recognized with a reasonable degree ofaccuracy by means of simple ccmputatlonal techniques.The Citation Identifier is the first of a series ofprograms for automatic and semiautcmatlc processing of cenputer-readable legal texts.
An extension of The Citation Identifierto reduced-form citations (e.g., "the Geddes decision", "theGeddes ease") is nOW in preparation.
In addition, The CitationAnalyzer~ a c~nputer program for automatic classification offuSl-form case citations is also in preparation.Several uses suggest th~nselves for a caaputer programcapable of identifying cheaply, rapidly, accurately, and exhaus-tively case citations in legal literature.
They seem to fallinto five broad and overlappin~ categ~ies :i. Aut~n~tic indexing and classification of legal literature,2.
Establishing counts of occurrences of case citations incase law and in statutory law,3- Determining ho~ case citations co-occur with other wordsand phrases in legal texts (this m~y lead eventually to corre-lating case citations with points-of-law),4.
Tracin~ associations between case citations and constructionof lists, tables, and graphs which display such associations,5.
Providing an automatic or s~miautQm~tic service for answer-i~  questions concerning documents in which a particular case orgroup of cases was cited.Syst~As for aut(m~tic identification of citations intexts and subsequent autc~tic extraction of case citations fr~ntexts may be useful to many groups, among the :i.
Lawyers, judges, government attorneys, and other membersof the legal profession,~.
M~nbers of various legislatures,3.
Officials in v~rious branches of the federal, state, andm~uicipal governments,4.
