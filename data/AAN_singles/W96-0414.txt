We will focus in particular ontwo major types of verbal differences observedin a corpus of bilingual (French - English) pro-cedural texts extracted from aircraft mainte-nance manuals.
To deal with these two typesof differences, we propose lexicalisation mech-anisms, which proceed from the same semanticrepresentation for both French and English re-alisations.
We will however discuss at the endof the paper other types of lexical differenceswhich may require language-specific inputs.keywords :  Multilingual generation, lexicalchoice, controlled languages.1 In t roduct ionTechnical documentation appears as a promis-ing application area for text generation?
Sev-eral works (\[18, 17, 6, 12, 7\] l) demonstratethat NLG techniques may contribute in the fu-ture to make technical documentation more re-liable and maintainable.
Many of these contri-butions are concerned with multilingual gen-eration, which is often presented as an alter-native to Machine Translation.
The multilin-gual generation approach stipulates that tech-nical documents, such as maintenance manu-als, can be generated automatically in several*This paper partly covers a work made by the au-thor at Dassault Aviation within a Technical coopera-tion between Dassault Aviation and British Aerospace- Military Aircraft Division.

Our objective in thisproject is to show how French and Englishmaintenance procedures can be generated froman abstract representation f underlying actionplans expressed in a formalism inspired by AIplanning models.
The role of the text gener-ator is to propose bilingual drafts of procedu-ral texts intended to be integrated in mainte-nance manuals, and to perform rephrasing op-erations which may be requested by the techni-cal author, for example grouping maintenanceinstructions at surface level or changing thespecificity level of an instruction.The design of a multilingual generation system,needless to say, requires a precise analysis of thelinguistic means used by each language to ex-press the same conceptual content.
The aim ofthis paper is to describe the main verbal differ-ences observed in a bilingual corpus of proce-dural texts and to analyse their impacts on thelexicalisation mechanisnm of the sentence gen-eration system GLOSE \[4\] used in GhostWriter.The structure of this paper is as follows.
I givein section 2 an overview of GLOSE.
Then, I dis-cuss brieily in the next section the corpus anal-ysis and its role in the design of the multilin-gual generation system.
Sections 4 and 5 fo-cus on specific types of lexical differences andthe related lexicalisation mechanisms.
Finally,the conclusion will describe some lexical diver-gences which may require the introduction oflanguage-specific semantic representations.1312 The sentence generatorOur sentence realiser GLOSE is based onMeaning-Text Theory (MTT) \[14\].
This linguis-tic theory offers many potentialities for mul-tilingual applications.
In computational lin-guistics, it has been primarily used as a the-oretical basis for language generation models(e.g.
\[2, 1, 16\]).
Recently, some works inthe fields of machine translation and compu-tational exicography (e.g.
\[8\], \[9\]) take advan-tage of lexicographic descriptive concepts of-fered by MTT, in particular the well-known no-tion of lexicalfunction.
In accordance with thestratified framework of MTT, the target repre-sentation of the lexicalisation process of CLOSEis a Deep Syntactic representation -- mainly adependency tree, whose nodes are labeled withfull lexemes and lexical fimctions.
The rela-tions between nodes represent deep syntacticrelations which are defined as abstractions oversuperficial syntactic relations.
The dependencytree is enriched with communicative biparti-tions such as Theme/Rheme and Given~New.We will ignore these communicative constraintsin this paper because they are of minor impor-tance for the linguistic phenomena consideredhere.
Lexical functions are used to representsyntactico-semantic relations between lexemes,such as synonymy, hyperonymy, and varioustypes of cotlocational relations.GLOSE is composed of two MT-models 2, one foreach of the two languages considered in our do-main.
It should be mentioned that only thegrammatical realisation 3 component of GLOSEcan be considered as an implementation of"pure" MY-models, since we do not use atthe lexicalisation phase MTT-style semantic net-works which represent in this theory a linguisti-cally motivated semantic level, independent ofthe conceptual level.
The integration of suchsemantic representations in a multilingual en-vironment raises several theoretical and practi-cal problems which will be the object of futureinvestigations.
We should note that these prob-2A Meaning-Text model consists of the grammarand the lexicon of a particular language.3We mean by grammatical realisation the following(main) linguistic operations: (1) transition from deepsyntactic representation to surface syntactic represen-tation, (2) linearisation of the surface syntactic repre-sentation and (3) surface morphology.lems are studied by several NLG researchers (eg,\[10, 11, 13\]).
At present, we consider the lexi-calisation problem as a mapping process fromconceptual representations to French and En-glish lexemes.
This process relies on concept-lexeme mapping structures, integrated in thelexicon, and which represent elementary tran-sitions from conceptual structures to lexemes.3 The contrast ive analysisThe corpus is composed of about thirty bilin-gual pairs of extended procedural texts ex-tracted fl'om aircraft maintenance manuals.Our contrastive analysis concentrates on verbalexpressions.
Verbal differences between Frenchand English instructions can be classified alongthree interrelated imensions: (1) l ez i ca l -French and English versions diverge because ofdifferences in the lexical resources available inboth languages - -  (2) syntact i c -  equivalentverbs exist but the two versions cannot relyon similar syntactic onstruct ions-- ,  and (3)stylistic - -  lexically and syntactically equiva-lent versions may be obtained but one of themwould be stylistically incorrect.We should stress that, when designing the lex-icalisation component of a multilingual gen-eration system, one should be careful in de-ciding how much importance should be givento such a contrastive analysis.
In the corpus,bilingual sentences expressing the same contentmay differ significantly, even though closely re-lated and acceptable versions can be obtained.Hence, in such cases, it is difficult to know ifthe author(s) had good reasons to make theEnglish and French versions so different andif the differences hould be respected in theautomatic generation process.
For aeronauticmaintenance procedures, controlled languages- -  in particular AECMA/AIA Simplified Englishand GIFAS Rationalised French - -  provide use-ful guidances, which help to identify the rel-evant differences for multilingual generation.The lexical differences reported in the next sec-tions will be systematically evaluated from acontrolled language perspective.
This does notmean that controlled languages should be con-sidered as "absolute" references.
We will seethat the writing rules defining these languagesare sometimes too general.1324 Operator  verbsOur corpus analysis reveals that a precise ac-count of operator verbs is required.
This texicalclass encloses emantically poor items like do,carry out in English and effectuer, proc~der inFrench, which are combined with predicativenouns to form complex predicates.
For exam-pie, in sentence (1F), the operator verb procgdertakes as its direct object the predicative nounremplissage which, in some way, denotes theaction to be performed:(1F) Procdder  au rempl issage du rdservoir hy-draulique.(Lit.
'Proceeds with the filling of the hydraulicreservoir.
')Operator verb constructions have already beenstudied from a machine translation perspec-tive \[5\].
Such constructions raise an interest-ing problem for MT because they cannot betranslated in a purely compositional manner.For example, a compositional English transla-tion of the sentence "John a posd une questiond Mary" would lead to the incorrect sentence"John put a question to Mary", whereas thecorrect (or the more closely related) transla-tion would be "John asked Mary a question".To make the appropriate translation, an MTsystem should be able to identify in the initialsentence the semi-idiomatic expression poserune question and consequently build a sentencebased on the equivalent English expression aska question.
Besides, the equivalent expressionin the target language does not always exist,,which means that even more complex corre-spondences should be found.
The literal trans-lation associated to sentence (Iv) illustratesthis point.
We can hardly get an acceptableEnglish translation if we want to preserve thestructure of the French instruction.
The En-glish equivalent of (1F) found in the corpus isbased on the verb fill which takes as direct ob-ject the translation of the argument of the pred-icative noun remplissage in (1F):(1E) Fill the hydraulic reservoir.French and English instructions often divergeon this aspect.
Operator verbs are exceedinglycommon in the French versions.
We have foundmany pairs of bilingual instructions where theFrench instruction is based on an operator verbconstruction and the English instruction on asimple verb.
Here are some excerpts which il-lustrate this regularity:(2E) Bleed suction lines.
(2F) Effectuev la purge du circuit d'aspiration.(Lit.
'Carry out the bleeding of suction lines.
')(3E) Change the hydraulic fluid.
(3F) Ef fectuer  le renouve l lement  du liquidehydraulique.(Lit.
'Carry out the renewal of hydraulic liquid.
')(4E) Carefully clean the filter body.
(4F) Effeetuer un nettoyage soignC du corpsdu filtre.(Lit.
'Carry out a careful cleaning of the filterbody.
')It is important to note that, in many cases,these French instructions can be paraphrasedby sentences based on simple verbs.
For exam-ple, sentence (2F) can be paraphrased by thesentence based on the verb purger, directly re-lated to the predicative noun used in (2F):(2F') Purger le circuit d'aspiration.
((2F') is the closest translation of the Englishversion (2E))This remark holds for all the examples givenabove.
The choice of operator verbs is of-ten a consequence of technical writers'stylisticpreferences.
However, as shown by the literaltranslations, stylistically inadequate sentenceswould result if this preference were equally ap-plied for English.Simplified English and Rationalised Frenchsuggest o restrict the use of operator verbs, as-suming that verbs that directly show the actionsmake maintenance instructions clearer.
How-ever, operator verbs cannot always be avoided,even in English.
Consider the following pair:(5E) Gain access to rear compartment.
(5F) Acedder d la soute artiste.We can hardly find an acceptable paraphrase of(5E) built on a simple verb.
We will also showlater that sometinms operator verbs cannot beavoided when some attributes of the action tobe performed should be conveyed explicitly.133Sem/-nput = act lon - token- i  / ...'"i l l oc -wa lue  - Imperat lv4 .

For this kind of dif-ferences, the French and English lexicalisationsrely on the same basic mechanisms.
However,the way these basic mechanisms are combinedis language-specific.Let us look more closely at the pair (1) 4 and atthe lexicalisation process required to producesuch sentences.
Surface realisation starts withthe following input representation:SemInput  = hct ion - token- Il l l oc -va lue  = Imperat iveDomain -pred icate  = f i l lAgent  = ob jec t - token-2Domain -ob jec t  = operator - iRe ferent ia l - s ta tus  = spec i f i cPat ient  = ob jec t - token-3Domain -ob jec t  = hydr - reservo i r -4Referent ia l - s ta tus  = spec i f i cThis structure represents an imperative illocu-tionary act.
Its propositional content is an ac-tion of type f i l l  which has two argumentsAgent and Pat ient .
The figure I illustrates4(1E) Fill the hydraulic reservoir.
(IF) Procdder au remplissage du rdservoirhydraulique.potential correspondences between this inputrepresentation an(\] the deep syntactic repre-sentations required to derive sentences (1E),(iF'), and (le) after grammatical realisation.The dotted arrows indicate the possible lexi-cal mappings of the conceptual predicate f i l l .Tile English realisation and the first Frenchoption (1F') rely on a simple correspondencebetween the predicate f i l l  and correspondingverbs (fill and remplir).
By contrast, the sec-ond French option is based on a complex cor-respondence between the predicate f i l l  and amulti-lexemic structure procdder it> remplis-sage.To deal with this lexical phenomenon, two lex-icalisation rules are involved.
These rules mayroughly be described as follows.
Given the in-put representation'5 :SemInput = act ion - tokenI l l oc -va lue  = Imperat iveDomain -pred icate  = PAgent  = x,Pat ient  = x=Rolen = x.5For sake of clarity, we consider that the illocution-cry value is always imperative since we strictly focus inthis paper on the instructional parts of the procedures.This illocutionary value does not affect the lexicalisa-tion of the proposition, i.e the construction of the deepsyntactic tree.
However, it has an effect on grammat-ical realisation, such as erasing the subject during thetransition to surface syntactic level.134rl: Simple Verb Construction1.
Look in the concept - lexeme mappingstructures for a correspondence P ~ V.2.
Lexicalise the arguments xl, ..., Xn andlink the resulting lexemic structures to V.r2: Operator Verb Construction1.
Look for a mapping structure P ~ N.2.
Look in the lexical entry of N for a verb gsuch that V = Operl(N).3. lexicalise xl and link the resulting lexemicstructure to V by means era deep syntacticrelation I.4.
Link N to V by means of a relation II.5.
Lexicalise the remaining argumentsxa, .... Xn and link the resulting lexemicstructures to 1'1'.Several remarks should be made about theserules:?
To link predicative lexemes to their depen-dents (i.e.
realisations of arguments), corre-spondences I)etween conceptual roles and deepsyntactic relations (\[, 1I, .
.
.
,  IV) are specifiedin the lexical entry of each verb and predicativenoun.
Hence, a conceptual-lexeme mappingstructure indicates not only which lexeme(s)can be used to express a concept but also howthe roles of the concept should be realised interms of deep syntactic relations.?
In a MTT-like lexicon, predicative nouns arelinked to their operator verbs I)y means of thelexical functions Operx,  Opera,  .
.
.
( for  ex-ample, Operl(remplissage) = procdder).
Thenumber designates the actant of the predicativenoun which is promoted as first actant (syntac-tic subject) of the operator verb.
In the proce-dures we have analysed, only the Oper l  func-tion seems to be relevant.?
The rule r2 maps a single concept P to amulti-lexemic structure composed of an oper-ator verb governing a predicative noun.
How-ever, this correspondence is not given as suchin the lexicon.
It appears more natural to con-sider that the lexical realisation performed byrule r2 relies primarily on a correspondence b -tween the predicate P and the predicative noun.It should also be mentioned that such basic cor-respondences can also be exploited to gener-ate similar phrases in other types of construc-tions.
For example, the correspondence :f5.11rernplissage, used by the rule r2 when gen-erating the sentence (1F) can also be used toconstruct he nominalisation le remplissage del'accumulateur in the declarative sentence:(6F) .Le remplissage de l 'aeeumulateur doltprovoquer l'allumage du voyant sur letableau hydluulique.(Lit.
'The replenish of the accumulator shouldcause the warning light to come on on the hy-draulic panel.')?
The lexicalisation of arguments involves othermechanisms, which concern in particular theconstruction of referring expressions \[3\].?
An appropriate generation of multilingual in-structions in accordance with these lexical dif-ferences can be achieved by assigning prioritiesto these rules.
In English, rt should be priv-ileged and r2 applied only if rx fails.
For ex-ample, this last case would occur when gener-ating sentence (SE) 6. rl would fail because thelexicon does not contain a mapping structurerelating the atomic predicate gain_access anda simple verb.
In French, it is, however, dif-ficult to assign absolute priorities in the sameway, since we can find both types of construc-tions in similar contexts.
If stylistic preferencesobserved in the corpus have to be reflected inthe automatically generated texts, a reasonablesolution would be to select indifferently one ofthese rules.
Notice that Rationalised French,which is not, respected in the procedural textswe have analysed, will assign a higher priorityto rl, resulting in an identical parameterisationof the lexicalisation mechanisms for both lan-guages.4.2 The  prob lem o f  complex  ac t ionsWe have assumed so far that actions to be ver-balised can be represented by simple predicate- argument structures.
However, actions mayhave attributes (manner, temporal constraints,S(5E) Gain access to rear compartment.135.
.
. )
which should be conveyed explicitly.
Ingeneral, the two types of constructions repre-sented by rules rl ~nd r2 are possible, even whensome attribute of the action should be realisedat surface level.
For example, in (4F) 7 the man-ner attr ibute of the cleaning action is expressedas an adjective since this action is nominalised.But if the same action were expressed as a verbthe manner attribute would take the form of anadverbial modifier:(4F') Nettoyer soigneusement le corps du filtre.(Lit.
'Carefully clean the body of the filter.
')To deal with such modifiers, a minor extensionof rules rl and r2 is required.
The rules shouldbe able to introduce modifiers on the 'main'predicative element of the sentence, i.e.
themain verb in rx and the direct object of theoperator verb (the predicative noun) in r2:?
In rx: an attribute of the action will be re-alised as an adverb linked to the main verbV by means of an attributive deep syntac-tic relation (ATTR).?
In r2: the attribute will be reatised as anadjective which linked to the predicativenoun N with an attributive relation.The problem is that sometimes these attributescannot take an adverbial form anti in the anal-ysed procedural texts, it seems that this limi-tation is an important motivation for using op-erator verbs.
They provide the ability to in-troduce such attributes in an adjectival form.Consider the following pair:(7E) Carry out a dry ventilation of the reactor.
(7v) Effectuer une ventilation s~che durdacteur.From both English and French versions, wecannot derive in a simple way equivalent ex-pressions based on a simple verb because of theadverbial modifiers:(TE') *Ventilate drily the reactor.
(7F') *Ventiler s~chement le rdaeteur.A key problem for text generation is to be ableto avoid such incorrect sentences.
This prob-lem has already been tackled in \[1..5\].
Meteerproposes to express the input semantic con-tent in terms of abstract linguistic resources,7 (4F) Effectuer un nettoyage soignd u corps du filtre.i.e.
semantic categories, which prevent in-correct combinations of concrete linguistic re-sources during surface realisation.
FollowingMeteer's analysis, the lexeme dry in (7E) de-notes a property which cannot be realised ifan event perspective is taken on the predicate.This constraint enforces the nominalisation ofthe action.
By contrast, an attribute of cate-gory manner can be combined with both eventand object perspectives.
This explains why(4F) and (4F') are both acceptable.
In manycases, the characterisation of attributes alongthe semantic opposition manner/property ex-plains the acceptability or inacceptability of the"adverbial forms".
However, this characterisa-tion is not always straightforward and it ap-pears that more precise oppositions hould beintroduced.5 Specif ic ity level of  verbali temsAnother important lexical difference concernsthe specificity level of each element of the bilin-gual pairs.
A French instruction may be lessspecific because a conceptual argument hasbeen left implicit while explicitly realised in theequivalent English instruction.
However, evenwhen both instructions are at tile same speci-ficity level, differences may appear in the waysemantic ontent is spread over the lexical ma-terial.
This is mainly due to the fact that verbsavailable in both languages do not necessarilycover the same part of the initial content.We will focus on three types of lexical diver-gences which are frequent in the analysed pro-cedures:1.
Domain-spec l f i c  vs ord inary  verbThe two verbs have similar argument struc-tures but one of them belongs to the technicaljargon of the domain.
(8E) Unlock valve clapper nut.
(8F) Ddfreiner l'dcrou du clapet de valve.The verbs unlock and dgfreiner have a veryclose meaning, but tile second one is domainspecific and imposes more c~nstraints on itssecond argument (the direct object).
For ex-ample, the English sentence unlock the door isacceptable but not the French one Ddfreiner laporte.1362.
Specif ic  vs genera l  verbOne of the two verbs has a more specific mean-ing:(9E) Charge the accumulator with nitrogen.
(9F) Gonfler l'accumulaleur h l'azote.(Lit.
'Inflate the accumulator with nitrogen.
')The choice of a more general verb for the En-glish version is purely stylistic since a specificverb - -  inflate - -  exists, as shown in the literaltranslation of (gF).
We have found several di-vergences of this kind, which seem to be stylis-tically motivated.
\[19\] describes imilar diver-gences between English and German instruc-tions.Notice that, with respect o Simplified English.sentence (9E) is not acceptable, since specificverbs have to be prefered when available.We will see in section 5.1 that, interestingly, in-structions can be made more precise with gen-eral verbs because of differences in argumentstructures: a general verb may have a more ex-tended argument structure than a specific one.3.
Ord inary  vs denomina l  verbThe two verbs have distinct argument struc-tures.
One of them, in general the English one,incorporates an argument which is expresse(tat surface level in the French version.
Such ar-gument incorporation is often realised throughthe use denominal verbs which are much morefrequent in English procedures:(iOE) J ack  up the aircraft.
(IOF) Mettre l'avion sur vdrins.(Lit.
'Put the aircraft on jacks.
')The verb jack up has no direct equivalent inFrench.
Hence, the French version has to relyon a general verb and the locative argumentshould be realised at surface level.
In the cor-pus, denominal verbs are systematically usedin the English versions (when they are avail-able) even though this choice leads to bilingualpairs with quite different lexical structures.Such verbs ensure conciseness and, sometimes,the lack of denominal verbs in French makesthe French version much longer.
It should bestressed that, in general, both instructions areat the same specificity level, even though oneof them appears more complex.5.1 Consequences  fo r  the  lexicalisa-tion mechanisms1.
Let us start with the first type of differences,domain-specific us ordinary verb.
The corpusshows that domain-specific verbs are often pref-ered over ordinary verbs.
A plausible motiva-tion of this preference is that, as illustrated byexample (8) s, they impose precise selectionalrestrictions on the arguments.
The importantpoint for multilingual generation is that the ab-sence of a domain specific verb in one languagedoes not affect lexicalisation in the other one(i.e., a specific verb will be used if available).2.
The second type of differences i a more com-plex issue.
Both Simplified English and Ra-tionalised French include a writing rule whichsays that specific words should be prefered overgeneral words.
This rule can be used as a guid-ing principle in the verb selection mechanisms.However, it is not always sufficient in order toreach the appropriate specificity level requiredfor the instruction.
Selecting a more specificverb does not necessarily lead to a more spe-cific instruction., A verb may have a precisemeaning but a restricted argument structurewhich may force to leave implicit some part ofthe initial content.
To illustrate this point, letus compare the following surface realisations ofthe same instruction:(11 E) Remove lockwire from filler bowl.
(l iE') Unlock the filter bowl.The verb unlock is more specific than remove,but the locking device to be removed is notspecified as a surface argument of the verb.
Bycontrast, this argument can be made explicitwith the verb remove.
Which of these two ver-sions can be considered more specific?
(l lE)seems more specific, for the 'unlocking' action,though incompletely specified by the main verbremove, is somewhat suggested by the argu-ment loekwire (since, obviously, the function ofa lockwire is to lock).
Besides, it brings an-other information - -  the nature of the lockingdevice - -  which cannot be expressed in ( l iE').The integration in a text generation system ofsuch evaluations of instruction specificity levelis not a straightforward issue.
Complex worlds(8E) Unlock valve clapper nut.
(8F) Ddfreiner l'dcrou du clapet de valve.137knowledge and lexical semantic inferences areinvolved in these evaluations, and they requirea deeper model of domain knowledge and pre-cise semantic definitions of lexical items.
Atpresent, our approach is less ambitious.
Wetake advantage of the simple heuristic: "themore arguments a verb has, the more specificthe resulting instruction" in order to detect po-tential conflicts.
This ability of detecting lex-ical options may help to perform rephrasingoperations.
For example, if sentence (l iE') isgenerated first, considering that more specificverbs should be privileged, a rephrasing requestwould cause the generator to propose an alter-native realisation based on the general verb re-move which allows to express at surface levelthe argument left implicit in the first proposal.According to our corpus, this kind of rephras-ing operations will normally concerns only theEnglish versions, since in the French proceduresspecific verbs are systematically prefered.Let us now describe briefly how these function-alities are concretely integrated in the lexical-isation component.
The generation of an in-struction based on a specific verb involves therules rx and r2 (see section 4.1)"( These rulesmake correspondences between the conceptualpredicate of the action and a specific lexicalitem.
The choice of a more general verb relieson the same rules but the generation processwill proceed from a transformed input repre-sentation built on a superordinate predicate.For instance, to produce sentence (11E') m, lex-icalisation will proceed from the following rep-resentation, provided that the mapping struc-ture remove-locking-device ~ unlock is givenin the lexicon:SemInput  = Act ion - token- II l l oc -va lue  = ImperativeDomain-predicate = remove-locking-deviceAgent = object - token-2Domain-object = operator-1Referent ia l - s ta tus  = spec i f i cPat ient  = ob jec t - token-3Domain -ob jec t  = lockwi re -4Referent ia l - s ta tus  = spec i f i cLocat ion  = ob ject - token-4Domain -ob jec t  = f i l te r -bowl -5Referent ia l - s ta tus  = spec i f i c9And also the rule r3 dedicated to the selection ofdenominal verbs and wlfich will be defined later.m(l lE') Unlock the filter bowl.At the deep syntactic level, only argumentsAgent and Locat ion will be realised as ac-tants of the verb unlock (Agent as actant \[and Locat ion as actant II).
The generationof sentence (lIE) 11 will proceed from an inputrepresentation based on the superordinate con-ceptua.l predicate romove with the same argu-ments.
The predicate will be directly linked totile verb remove as specified in the lexicon andthe three arguments will be realised at the deepsyntactic level.3.
As we have already said, the use of de-nominal verbs often causes differences betweenthe French and English versions of instructions,since they are usually not available in French.Besides, even when they are available they arenot systematically used as in the English ver-sions, as attested by the following example:(12E) Pvessurise the hydraulic system.
(12F) Mettre le circuit hydraulique sous pres-8iOn.(Lit.
'Put the hydraulic system under pressure.
')The sentence (12F') based on the denominalverb prdssuriser and which is equivalent to(12F) is also present in the corpus:(12F') Pressuriser le circuit hydraulique.The lexicalisation rules defined so far performmappings between a single concept (the pred-icate) and one or several lexemes.
By con-trast, the selection of denominal verbs involvesmappings between several concepts and a sin-gle lexeme.
A denominal verb covers not onlythe main predicate but also an argument ofthe predicate.
In the example given in figure2, the French and English versions are derivedfrom the same conceptual representation.
TheFrench version results from a one to one map-ping between concepts of the input representa-tion and lexemes.
In particular, the predicatelock is directly mapped to the verb freiner andthe argument Ins t rument  o the phraseme 'illfrein'.
The generation of such sentences relieson rules rl and r 2.
However, in the Englishversion, it is the combination of the predicatelock and the argument Ins t rument  which ismapped to the main verb lockwire.To ensure such correspondences, an additionalIt (llz) Remove lockwire from filter bowl.138.

Lexicalise the remaining arguments andlink the resulting lexemic structures to V.To be consistent with the lexical preferencesobserved in the corpus, this rule should havethe highest priority.The incorporated argument does not alwayshold the same semantic role.
For example, itcan be the instrument as in the verbs lock-wire, energise and pressurise or a locative ar-gument as in the verb jack up.
It should also bementioned that such incorporations are not re-stricted to arguments.
\[19\] discusses closely re-lated phenomena concerning German, Englishand French instructions.
The authors providein particular some examples where a mannerattribute is realised as an adverb in Englishwhile incorporated in the verb in German andFrench tu.6 Conclus ionWe have focused in this paper on some frequentlexical differences between French and Englishinstructions.
We have also proposed a specifi-cation of lexicalisation mechanisms, without in-troducing distinct semantic representations forFrench and English lexicalisations.
We do notclaim however that distinct representations canalways be avoided.
Our corpus reveals the ex-istence of deeper differences (though less fre-quent) which call for language-specific repre-sentations.
For example, we have found sev-eral instructions where aspectual values areconveyed explicitly in French but not in En-glish.
Another interesting case concerns agen-tivity values assigned to the operator in the in-structions.
Consider the following example:(13E) Allow hydraulic pressure to fall.
(13F) Chuter la pression hydraulique.(Lit.
'Decrea.se hydraulic pressure.
')In (13E), the operator is presented as the en-abler of a physical process, whereas in (13F), het2For example:(E) affect adverse ly-  (G) beeintr<ichtigen- (F) amoindr i r139is presented ms the causer of an action.
It seems \[9\]that the generation of such a bilingual pair re-quires language-specific semantic inputs builton distinct event categories.
Interestingly, wehave noticed that  controlled languages will not,,in most cases, allow these deeper differences toappear.
One of the pair is often rejected bythe corresponding controlled language.
For ex-ample, (13E) does not comply with SimpliliedEnglish, which would encourage the use of themore direct form: Decrease the hydraulic pres-.sure.
This last sentence is closer to (13F) andwe can reasonably suppose that  these two sen- \[ll\]tences can be generated from the same input.AcknowledgmentsI wouhl like to thank Alexis Nasr, CorinneFournier, and Owen Rainbow for helpful com-ments on ealier versions of this paper.D.
