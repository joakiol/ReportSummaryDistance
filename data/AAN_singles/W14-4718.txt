McCraeUniversit?at BielefeldGermanyjmccrae@cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.deAbstractThe following paper presents a further extension of the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology(SUMO), i. e. the development of default physical measurements for most of its classes(Artifacts, Devices, Objects) and respective children.
The extension represents an ar-bitrary, computable and reproducible approximation of defaults for upper and middle-level con-cepts.
The paper illustrates advantages of such extension, challenges encountered during thecompilation, related work and future research.1 IntroductionOver the last fourteen years SUMO (Pease, 2011; Niles and Pease, 2001) has been developed into a large,general-domain ontology, which currently1includes 20,000 terms and 80,000 axioms stated in higher-order logic (Pease and Schulz, 2014).
SUMO provides an open source environment for the developmentof logical theories called SIGMA (Pease, 2011; Pease, 2003b).
This enables the manipulation of differentformal languages (including TPTP and OWL), (Adam Pease and Sams, 2003; Pease, 2003a).
Amongthem, the logical formal language SUO-KIF has been selected for the development of knowledge-based(or KB) terms, through which SUMO can be searched.
Another possible search of terms in SUMO is viathe Princeton WordNet ?, to which the ontology has been fully mapped(Pease and Niles, 2003; Peaseand Li, 2003; Pease and Murray, 2003).In the first part of this paper, after introducing SUMO in generic terms, we explain the motivationbehind the undergone extension of 300+ physical default measurements (the term ?default?
is hereby usedas synonym for ?approximation?
or ?estimation?).
The second part deals with the advantages and issuesencountered during the compilation of the defaults, and presents some practical examples of defaults andhigher-order annotation.
Related research and future work follow.2 Default physical measurements in SUMOThe original intent behind the development of default physical measurements in SUMO is to providefactual peer-reviewed information about physical measurements of ontological classes.
Almost all ap-proximations of the default values have been established with reference to current ISO standards or normsset by governmental regulations.
Only in the case that standard values are not provided or could not beretrieved, the compiler of the defaults has relied on personal judgment.
In both cases, all defaults havebeen manually double-checked for validity by the compiler and the SUMO developer.SUMO seems to be one of the first general-knowledge ontologies to provide extensive information onphysical default measurements.
Other data bases like DBpedia have (according to the authors?
knowl-edge) just recently started to provide a similar kind of information.2The physical defaults represent a bigrepository of approximated values based on physical properties, such as length, volume, size, width and?Same affiliation of the first author.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

The approximation, as the term itself says, is partly arbitrary, computable, and comprehensivelyconducted.
The measurements are formalized in minimum and maximum default values.
The wording?maximum?
and ?minimum?
should not been treated as the highest and lowest values attached to therespective Artifacts, but as some high or low values these Entitys can own.2.1 AdvantagesWe believe that the compilation of the defaults accomplishes three major advantages in the current formatof the SUMO ontology:1.
Ontological formalization.2.
Objective adjustable values of physical properties.3.
Computable reproducible estimations of physical values.Point (1) mirrors SUMO attempt as extensive ontology of general knowledge.
Natural language failsin providing specificity for every single word and predicate, partly due to polysemy, synonymy as well asobjective limitations of extensive precise formal description.
We often refer to a term in vague sense andmeaning, such as in the case of ?car?
or ?truck?.
For further specification of the same, we tend to createnew lemmas, derivatives and compounds.
SUMO underscores a lemma in its definitional and ontolog-ical extent and the defaults consider the lemma as prototypical.
As for its definitional extent, SUMOprovides the definition of the lemma as reported in the Princeton WordNet ?.
As ontological and proto-typical entity, the lemma is described in first-order and/or higher-order logic and thus transformed into aSUO-KIF KB term.
In the case of Truck, the term is enlisted under TransportationDevicein SUMO.
The following description in first-order logic (containing the quantifier ?exists?)
specifi-cally states: ?If a TransportationDevice is an instance of a Truck, then there exists a kindof Object such that a kind of Object is a subclass of Object and kind of Object is a Cargo typeof TransportationDevice.
(=>(instance ?T Truck)(exists (?L)(and(subclass ?L Object)(cargoType ?T ?L))))Figure 1.: Example of a first-order axiom in SUO-KIFEntity 2Physical 5Object 11Artifact 58Device 112TransportationDevice 9Vehicle 12LandVehicle 10RoadVehicle 6PoweredVehicle 12SelfPoweredRoadVehicle 4CargoVehicle 1Truck 3MilitarySupplyTruckLightTruckTruckTractor 1PeterbiltTruckFigure 2.: Graphic documentation of the relation subclass for the term Truck with relative enumerateddirect-childrenFig.

The graph can be further extended to more levels,thus enabling a comprehensive look of all the branches that depart from the upper concept Entity.
Asfor fig.

The defaults are set on objectively comparable properties, such as height, volume,weight, length and width.
These are all features of size and mass that can be counted and approximated,with different units of measures.Finally, the (3) advantage that we reckon exists in having the defaults is their computability.
De-spite being relative and partially arbitrary measures4, the defaults are adjustable and reproducible, whichmakes them adaptable to representation models, peer-review and further estimations.
We believe that thisway of calculating defaults of physical Objects is certainly more reliable than other attempted methods(e. g. (Bennett, 2001):117-118).52.2 Issues encountered during the researchSome challenges were encountered during the compilation of default measurements.?
The defaults cover classes of upper concepts in SUMO, and part of their children, but not thepredicates that can possibly collocate with them.
For example, concepts like Aircraft orHelicopter are covered in SUMO, but not expressions like ?light aircraft?
or ?civilian helicopter?.Sometimes, SUMO already provides a logical description of these adjectives as incorporated inthe concept itself, as in the case of MilitaryAircraft, SelfPoweredRoadVehicle, orPrintedBook (fig.
4), meaning that rather then specifying the predicate, a new term is created.SUMO users should bare in mind that the Artifacts in SUMO always aim at representing a3As in the case of Truck the defaults have been established by looking at the standard sizes as set by the U.S. Department ofTransportation and Federal Highway Administration, http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/sw/index.htm4As previously discussed in the paper, the defaults have been assigned on a subjective basis in case standard defaults couldnot been retrieved/are not available.
Also, the defaults sometimes apply to one country?s regulations, and are therefore notinternationally valid.
Finally, the defaults have been given with selected units of measures (e. g. inches instead of centimeters,or pounds instead of kilograms.
This specified, one should bear in mind the intention of the default extensions, namely toprovide an approximation of prototypical, not universal Artifacts.5Bennett, in his study on physical objects and geographic concepts, tries to delimit the boundaries of vague entities by providinganswers to size-related questions (e. g. ?How large an area must a forest occupy?
Are there any constraints in its shape?
Mustit be maximal or could it share a border with another region of forest??).
In SUMO, we believe that the defaults, through whichsome of these questions can be answered, are more reliable, since anchored to standard values.140prototypical form of the same Object, i. e. a kind that is possibly shared in the collective think-ing.
The representation for Book as showed below aims therefore at representing the possibly mostcommonly form of Book known, namely a printed and not an electronic version of the same.
(=>(instance ?BOOK PrintedBook)(exists (?SHEET1 ?SHEET2)(and(component ?SHEET1 ?BOOK)(component ?SHEET2 ?BOOK)(instance ?SHEET1 PrintedSheet)(instance ?SHEET2 PrintedSheet)(not(equal ?SHEET1 ?SHEET2)))))(=>(and(instance ?ARTICLE1 Article)(instance ?BOOK Book)(subsumesContentInstance ?BOOK ?ARTICLE1))(exists (?ARTICLE2)(and(instance ?ARTICLE2 Article)(not(equal ?ARTICLE2 ?ARTICLE1))(subsumesContentInstance ?BOOK ?ARTICLE2))))Figure 5.: Comparison between the logical annotation for Book in SUMO with the collocationalunit printed + BookIt needs to be specified that the concept of Attribute in SUMO is differently interpreted from theconcept of predicate or adjective in natural language.
Attributes in the Upper Merged Ontology areinstances of upper classes, but there also exists classes of Attributes.
The Attribute class cancontain subclasses (e. g. Female, Male, BiologicalAttribute), but these have not beenassigned default physical values.
The motivation is basically that we cannot numerically defineabstracta, such as gender, color, or emotions and feelings.
In the case of abstract concepts, such asStockMarket or InterestRate, we have tried to figure out these, where possible, as physicalobjects (e. g. the place where financial transactions take place, or the sheet where rates are printedon).Other sort of literally definable attributes (including comparative forms) are included in SUMOin the form of relations, which express, inter alia, equations and inequalities (greaterThan,smallerThan, larger, earlier, interiorPart, temporalPart, (Pease,2011):113).
Finally, what is defined in SUMO as PhysicalAttribute shouldnot be confused with the physical default values added to the ontology.
Instances ofthis class include Compliance, Conductivity, Flammable, Inductance,MutualInductance, Resistivity, Stiffness.Despite the lack of a comprehensive cover of linguistically definable collocational compounds inSUMO (as above mentioned), we estimate that it is not impossible to approximate values for them,given the existence of defaults for the concept that carries the predicate.
For instance, it can bederived that BigHouse (not enlisted in SUMO) is something that can be 1.9 times bigger than aStudio, or 0.1 times smaller than a Mansion, once the standard values for House, Studioand Mansion are given.Given a partial ordering of gradable adjectives6that apply to a particular noun, we could createaxioms (thus inducing a productive process) which would then partition the physical space withrespect to that particular adjective.
The fact that we have axioms would eventually release us fromdefining defaults for each class.
In other words, the most frequently an adjective collocates with aclass or a subclass, the higher is the chance to develop an axiom(s) that enables us to calculate thedefaults for these same classes automatically.?
SUMO provides ontological information regarding concepts in their a-contextual and unidiomaticform.
SUMO terms are not polysemous, therefore there is no notion of reusing a term to meansomething else.
This also means that specific cases of use for a term in specific ontologies, oras applied to metaphorical/idiomatic expressions, are not taken into account (e.?g.
turning tables?
;?cleared table?).
Instead, we specialize terms via subclassing and adding axioms on the subclassesterm when a new term is needed for a specific domain.6As interpreted by: (de Melo and Bansal, 2013; Schulam and Fellbaum, 2010; de Melo, 2014a; de Melo, 2014b).141?
The defaults are based on arbitrary subjective approximations of prototypes.
The provided informa-tion has been carefully peer-reviewed and the defaults can be used, re-used, or changed accordingto the user?s needs.
The intent is in fact to provide a basic estimation of the physical values for thatconcept.
Furthermore, we have used specific units of measurements to carry on the approximations(e. g. inches versus centimeters, tons and pounds versus kilos).
We acknowledge that this mighthinder or slow down the reausability process.3 Practical applications of defaults in linguistic disambiguationSince the development of the first several hundreds physical default measurements, their applicabilityand usefulness has been tested in two research studies.7The defaults have proven helpful in linguisticanalysis, particularly in the disambiguation of vague terms, such as vague predicates and concepts, aswell as more complex linguistic forms, such as similes and metaphors.
The advantage of having physicaldefaults based on standards and norms has given further validity to the disambiguation process.3.1 Default measurements and adjectives (lemonOILS and SUMOThe use of first order logic seems to break in the case of adjectives.
In a recent research, we thereforemake an in-depth analysis of different kinds of attributes and how they can be represented in differentontology-lexicon interfaces (lemonOILS and SUMO), and discuss the implications of the modelling withapplication to ontology-based question answering.3.2 Default measurements, metaphors and similesIn another current study (see previous footnote), we use default physical measurements to disambiguatesimiles frommetaphors.
Starting from the claim that the taught difference between metaphors and similesin terms of which has or does not have ?like?
or ?as?
in its form is not a linguistically and cognitivelysatisfactory statement, we design a computable model to test the validity of novel metaphors and similesand use the physical default measurements for our purpose.4 Future workThe extension of physical default measurements in SUMO is not intended to be the last of its kind.
In ourfuture work, we plan for instance a better specification of dimensionality.
During the compilation of thephysical defaults, we have in fact sometimes encountered the challenge of defining first the geometricalproperty proper of the concept.
For instance, taking a Leaf, do we usually refer to its length, or to itsheight?
Google can help to a certain extent in cases like this.
A better disambiguation of contextuallydependent measurements (length versus height, or width versus length) is therefore needed.
A furtherimprovement includes the compilation of mostly all subclasses and their children in higher-order logicas KB terms, as well as the assignment to them of physical defaults.
To enable an automatic productiveprocess in the generation of automatic axioms (as mentioned in 2.2), both with respect to collocationalforms and with regards to the similar physical defaults that may exist between parent and child, we stillneed to evaluate whether there should exist a mechanism for conflict resolution or overwrite.
If we takefor instance the example of Snake, we consider at the moment that this instance of Reptile mostprobably can inherit some of the properties of the parent, and viceversa.
As showed in 2.1 (fig.
3) abovethough, this derivation does not seem so obvious or even applicable, since there might be prototypicalproperties that might appear for one concept, but not for the other, or given the too high discrepancy ofmeasurements.Finally, once this comprehensive framework of properties and intuitive specification of defaults hasbeen created, we could conduct psycholinguistic empirical experiments to determine what are the de-faults and prototypes and examples that different classes of human beings hold to be true.
This couldgive us indication on how and if prototypicality overlayers with dimensionality.7Submitted accepted papers for the CogALex Workshop, COLING 2014, Dublin, Ireland and the CCLCC Workshop at ESSLI2014, Tuebingen, Germany.1425 ConclusionIn this paper we present a current extension of the general-domain ontology SUMO, i. e. the compilationof default physical measurements for 300+ classes and subclasses.
The aim of this extension is to providea peer-reviewed reliable, reusable and reproducible estimation of physical values for the ontology.
Thedefaults have already proven to be helpful in the disambiguation of vague predicates and concepts, aswell as similes and metaphors.
As open-source application, constantly updated and improved, it isplanned to apply further changes to the SUMO ontology, which include an even more comprehensivedevelopment of physical defaults, as well as the inclusion of other defaults for other properties.
Despitetheir approximation, the defaults represent a computational ground for representation models and furthercalculations.ReferencesW.R.
