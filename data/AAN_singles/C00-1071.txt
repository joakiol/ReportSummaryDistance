co. jp1 IntroductionAnalogies between strings of symbols, noted jA:B  = C:  \]), put four strings of symbolsinto "proportions."
They render an accountof, for instance, look: looked = walk : walkedor fab lc :  fabulous = miracle : miraculous,  ontlhe level of strings of symbols.
They are notintended to deal directly with, for instance,bird: wings = fish : f ins  or work :  worked =go:  went  which suppose knowledge about theworld or the tongue (IIofl?nan 95).
Analogiesmay be read as equalities, as well as equationsto be solved, as in:to looh : I lookcd = to act : x ~ x= l actcdThe goal of this paper is to establish some\['undamental, common-sense hypotheses (ax-ioms) about analogies in general; then to drawfrom them basic results (theorems)on analogiesbetween strings of symbols in particula.r; so asto propose a possible definition tbr \]~ngua.gesof analogical strings; and to prove that somefamous bmguages of particular interest o thelanguage processing community are very simplelanguages in this respect.
We further argue thatthe fact that the property of bounded growthis verified by ~ny such language is in favour ofmodelling part of natural anguage using suchlanguages.Our feeling is that analogy between strings ofsymbols is an operation as Nndamental as, e.g.,addition is to naturM numbers.

Ross\]As a consequence, we shall hypothesize the fol-lowing property:Ax iom 1 (Exchange of the  means)A:B= C:D ~ A :C=B: I )Another equivalence is also used by Aristotlein his Poetics.
It is based on the symmetry ofthe equality (the word "as," here): if we can saythat A is to B as C is to D, then we should alsobe able to say that C is to D as A is to B.Ax iom 2 (Symmetry of equality)A:B= C:D ~ C :D=A:B2.2 Equivalent Forms of AnalogyBy successive application of the previous hy-potheses, we get eight equiva.lent forms of thesame a.m~logy, listed hereafter in the alphabetorder of the term variables A, B, C a.nd D.Theorem 1 (Equivalent forms) The eightfo l lowing analogies are equivalent:488A:S =C:D (?A :C= (ii)11 : A = I) : C (i i i)  ~ i i+v i+ i iB:  D = A : ( /  ( iv) ~ i i i+ i iC:  A = D:  B (v) <= i i+i i i(v,,:)/) : B = C :  A (vi i )  <=- i i+v i+ i i iD : (7 = H:  A ('viii) ~ i i i - tv iSOllle interesting results may I)e el)rained onthe number of different l)ossible analogy classesgiven four ol)jex:ts, llowever, we shall leavethem aside :for lack of spa(;e.3 Ana logy  on  St r ings  o f  Sy lnbo lsVVe shall :now specialise on tim case where theIliOili bets of 1;he analogy being considered I)elongto a. set of strings of symbols.

Whether this is trueremains an open problem.lIowever, the previous intuition seems to holdanyway when the two anMogies to be concate-nated do not have any symbol in common.
WecMl such analogies, disjoint analogies.
The intu-ition is that, disjoint analogies :m~y be appliedone after another without any problem.
\]3utconcatenating in the same order is not the onlyp ossibility.One gets 2 4 = 16 analogies by enumerat-ing all possibilities of exchanging or :not ex-changing the substrings indexed by I a.:nd 2in A1A2 : B1B2 = CIC2 : DID2.
By number-ing these 16 a.ualogies using a binary notationreflecting the place where this exchange tookplace, numbers which are binm:y complementsdenote two equivalent analogies, of which onemay be eliminated from the list.
We list here-after those analogies with A1A2 as a first term.

A1A2 : l)2B1 = C'2C1 :.l)2.D1The number of diIferent cases is furtherreduced using (i) ?> (vii i) of the Equiw>lent t o r ,ns :  (ooo:,) ,~ (~ooo) ~, ((/~:,~)and (00\]0) ~ (0100)?
The reduced set is:{ (0000), (000\] ), (00\]0), (00\] l ), (0101), (0110) }.Similarly, (i) ?
:> (ii) of the Equivalent brn,syields the equivalences: (0010) ~ (0100) and(00ll) ~ (0101)?
The reduced set becomes:{ (oooo), (ooo~), (oo:l :,), (o:1 :, o) }.Of these tbur possible analogies, the secondone, (0001), where only one exchange is per-formed, is not true in genera.l.
For instance,ay:az  = by :x  is not acceptable when x =zb.
On the contrary, the three other possibleanalogies meet intuition, so that the followinghypothesis m~y be laid?Ax iom 4 (Concatenat ion)  Let I) bc an al-phabct, and V:, C \]), \])2 C F, ~'uch that\]21 ffl \])2 = O, V(A1,\])I ,C,,\])I) C (12.

'he previous definition conforms to the usual1)rese.ntation of formal languages.
It aims atthe generation of a language, q'hus, as usual,standard structural induction is used to gener-a.te all of the members of a language of analog-ical strings.
Starting with the elements of .4,all possible analogies with the elements of ~tdas models a.re applied.~.iPhe reciprocal problem of generation is thatof reco.qnitio'n.
With an analogical system, thegrammaticality of a given string, i.e., its mem-bership in a language, is tested against the setof a.ttested strings of that language, a.fter tile re-duction of that given string, by aa|a.logy, usingthe set of models.

Mild contcxt, sensitivity wasthus proposed by (Joshi 85) to characterise thefamily of languages captured by tree-adjoininggrammars (larger than context-free, but strictlysmaller than context-sensitive).However, this is a characterisation bya recog-nition device, and some have proposed otherintrinsic characterisations.
(Marcus & al.
96)have been advocating that, the key point in"mild context-sensitivity" is the property ofbounded growth: for each sentence in a lan-guage, we can always find another sentence inthe same language whose length differs t!l:om thelength of the first sentence by at most a givencon stan t.Definit ion 4 (Bounded growth) A la'n-guage ?
has the bounded growth property if (andonly ~') ?
is a singleton or 3k E IN /Now, it is easy to prove (see Appendix ) that:Theorem 7 Any language of analogical stringsverifies the bounded growth property.Consequently, a language like {a2'~/n C IN} isnot a language of analogical strings, as it doesnot have the bounded growth property.
Lucldlythus, some "unnatural" languages are out of thereach of languages of analogical strings.6 Conc lus ionOnly a slnall number of proposals have beenmade tbr the modelisation of analogy, the rareexceptions being (Itkonen 8: Ilaukioja 97) and,out of linguistics, (Hofsta.dter et al 94), maybebecause the dominant strea.m in linguistics foryears, tile generative one, against works bythe founders of modern linguistics (e.g.
(Sans-sure J6, Part 1II, Chap.
4 & 5)), explicitly re-butted analogy as a possible object of research(see (Itkonen gz naukioja 97, 7132 and 136), forquotations from Chomsky) under the fallaciouspretext that blind application of analogy maylead to falsity in logic and agra.mmaticality insyntax, ltowever, following recent results in ex-perimental psychology and refuta.tions of the in-nateness hypothesis (Itkonen 94), analogy nlayreasonably be argued to be a component in lan-guage (of course, surely not the only one).llaving posited only lbur fundanmntal hy-potheses on analogy, we have shown how to gen-erate a fmnily of formal languages, called lan-guages of analogical strings.
It is important onote that analogical string grammars, like sim-ple contextual grammars (llie 96), do not lnakeany use of non-terminals.
Crammaticality issin\]ply tested against some attested strings, af-ter reduction according to some models.
Thea.pproach by reductiol~ to attested \['orms has al-ready heen advocated in natural anguage pro-cessing (Sager 81).The key language {a'%'~c"~d'~/n > l} againstthe context-freeness hypothesis of natural lan-guage is easily shown to be a language of ana-logical strings.
Also, all languages of analog-ical strings possess the bounded growth prop-erty, which attempts to capture mild context-sensitivity, a notion introduced to cope with theapparent power of human languages.The fact that the regular language {a'~}, thecontext-free language {a%'~}, and the context-sensitive language {a ~ b ~ c '~ } are very similar 1 an-guages of analogical strings shows that analogyallows us "to get round" the Chomsky classiti-cation.7 AcknowledgementsThanks to Pr.
