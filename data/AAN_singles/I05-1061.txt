Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005CTEMP: A Chinese Temporal Parser for Extractingand Normalizing Temporal InformationWu Mingli, Li Wenjie, Lu Qin, and Li BaoliDepartment of Computing,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Kowloon, Hong Kong{csmlwu, cswjli, csluqin, csblli}@polyu.edu.hkAbstract.
Temporal information is useful in many NLP applications, such asinformation extraction, question answering and summarization.
In this paper,we present a temporal parser for extracting and normalizing temporal expres-sions from Chinese texts.
An integrated temporal framework is proposed, whichincludes basic temporal concepts and the classification of temporal expressions.The identification of temporal expressions is fulfilled by powerful chart-parsingbased on grammar rules and constraint rules.
We evaluated the system on a sub-stantial corpus and obtained promising results.1   IntroductionTemporal information processing is valuable in many NLP applications, such as in-formation extraction, machine translation, question-answering and multi-documentsummarization.
However, a wide scope of linguistic means, from lexical to syntacticphenomena, can represent this information.
It is hard to catch the internal temporalmeanings which are behind surface texts.
The potential applications and the flexibil-ities of temporal representations motivate our research in this direction.In this paper, temporal information is defined as the knowledge about time or dura-tion.
This information is crucial for both temporal reasoning and anchoring events onthe time line.
Temporal expressions are defined as chunks of text which convey director indirect temporal information.
TIMEX2 annotating guidelines [4, 6] give gooddescriptions about temporal expressions.
According to the guidelines, temporal ex-pressions include dates, times of day, durations, set-denoting expressions, event-anchored expressions, and so on.
To retrieve the useful temporal information con-tained in these temporal expressions, we need to identify the extents of temporal ex-pressions in raw text and then represent temporal information according to some stan-dard.
The two tasks are called temporal extraction and temporal normalization, re-spectively.
We have implemented a full system CTEMP, which consists of two mod-ules: extractor and normalizer.
The two modules fulfill temporal extraction and tem-poral normalization, respectively.A comprehensive temporal framework is investigated to analyze the elements in-volved in the mapping procedure, from surface text to internal temporal information.This framework includes basic temporal objects and relations, the measurement oftime, and the classification of temporal expressions from Chinese texts.
To cope withCTEMP: A Chinese Temporal Parser 695the flexibilities of the temporal expressions, we have built the temporal parser basedon chart-parsing and effective constraints.
Experiments with respect to a substantialcorpus show that the temporal parser achieves promising results.
We took part inTERN 2004 Chinese temporal expression extraction with this temporal parser and ourperformance is the highest in that track.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we give a brief discus-sion on related works; Section 3 describes the temporal framework, which is the basisof the whole temporal parser; extractor and normalizer of the temporal parser arediscussed in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively; Section 6 gives the descriptionabout experiments and evaluations.
Finally, conclusion and future work are presentedin Section 7.2   Related WorkMotivated by the potential applications, temporal information processing has ab-sorbed more attention recently than ever, such as ACL 2001 workshop on temporaland spatial information processing, LREC 2002 and TERN 2004 [14].
Mani [10]gives a good review about the recent trend.
Research works in this area can be classi-fied into four types: designing annotation scheme for temporal information represen-tation [4, 6, 12]; developing temporal ontology which covers temporal objects andtheir relationships between each other [2, 7]; Identifying time-stamps of events ortemporal relationships between events [5, 9]; Identifying and normalizing temporalexpressions from different languages [1, 3, 8, 11, 13, 15].Temporal annotation, temporal ontology and temporal reasoning are not the fo-cuses in this paper.
Among the research works on temporal expression extraction andnormalization, most of them are based on hand-written rules or machine-learnt rules.Mani and Wilson [11] resolve temporal expressions by hand-crafted and machine-learnt rules.
Their focus is resolving temporal expressions, especially indexical ex-pressions, which designate times that are dependent on the speaker and some refer-ence time.
We concentrate on the procedure of extraction and normalization, and tryto cover more temporal expressions.
Schilder and Habel [13] employ several finitestate transducers based on hand-written rules to extract and normalize time-denotingand event-denoting temporal expressions.
Evaluation of the system is presented on asmall corpus.Vazov [15] identifies temporal expressions based on context constraints and regu-lar expressions, but temporal expression normalization is not investigated.
Estela et al[3] present a temporal parser on Spanish based on grammar rules and evaluate thetagger on a small corpus.
Jang [8] reports a time tagger for Korean based on a human-edited, automatically-derived dictionary of patterns.
The dictionary is induced fromtraining data and is used to extract and normalize temporal expressions in texts.
Ahnet al [1] adopt the task of TERN 2004 evaluation and investigate machine learningmethods for extraction of temporal expression and rule based methods for normaliza-tion.
However, they focus on Korean and English text respectively and may not con-sider some characteristics of Chinese language.696 M. Wu et al3   Temporal FrameworkThe goal of the temporal parser is to extract and normalize temporal expressions.
Firstwe should realize the elements involved in this procedure.
We propose a temporalframework to describe temporal concepts, the measurement and all kinds of temporalexpressions in the surface text.
Our temporal parser is based on this comprehensiveframework.3.1   Basic Objects and RelationsIn the field of time, basic objects are just time and durations.
Time is a point or inter-val on the time line.
Given the origin and a measurement, it can be evaluated with areal number.
If there is no extra specification in Chinese text, the calendar is the Gre-gorian calendar.
Duration is the distance between some two times.
We can anchorduration by the start time and the end time, or by one of them and the length of theduration.
However, if duration is referred to just length, it cannot be anchored on thetime line.
In temporal field, relations between objects are also defined.
Between twotimes, relations are ?before?, ?same?, ?include?, ?after?.
These objects and relation-ships are internal concepts behind surface text and we hope to fetch them.3.2 The MeasurementTo represent lengths on the time line, a measurement should be given.
The temporalunits consist of two types, macro units and micro units, shown in Fig.
1.
To representa time, the scope of the numbers which can be combined with temporal units is lim-ited.
?Century?
and ?Year?
are two special time units, because only these two timeunits can help to anchor a time concept on the time line.
If there is no help from con-texts, other time units can not anchor a time concept on the time line.
These limita-tions are valuable in normalization of temporal expression.M o n th[1 .. .1 2 ]C e n tu ryY e a rQ u a r te r[1 .. .4 ]W e e k[1 .. .5 3 ]D a y[1 .. .3 1 ]M in u te[1 .. .6 0 ]H o u r[1 .. .2 4 ]S e c o n d[1 .. .6 0 ]M a c ro  U n i tsM ic ro  U n i tsFig.

The scheme of time units3.3   Representation in Chinese TextAccording to our observation on Chinese texts and the annotation standards ofTIMEX2 [4, 6] and TIMEX3 [12], temporal expressions can be classified into differ-ent classes.
They are shown in Fig.

The classification of temporal expressionIn Chinese, if people do not know the exact number at an inferior time level, theymay append an imprecise description to denote a position in a larger scope, such as????
?/the spring of last year?.
We named these temporal expressions ?PosDate?.These expressions consist of date expressions and imprecise appendix.?TempWord?
expressions are some Chinese words which contained temporalmeanings, such as ??
?/the lunar new year?, ???/now?.
?Composite?
expressionsinclude basic temporal expressions, calculated expressions and special expressions,such as ?1999?4?28?/April 28, 1999?, and ???
?/after two years?
and ?1999??
/ the fiscal year 1999?.
?Set?
expressions denote a set of time and most of themare about frequency, such as ??
?/every year?
and ???
?/every two days?.
?Even-tAn?
expressions are relevant to the times of events, such as ?????
?/when hewas speaking?.
?EventAn?
expressions can be anchored on the time line only after thetimes of the events are resolved.4   Extractor Based on Grammar and ConstraintsThe task of extractor is to identify the extents of temporal expressions in the surfacetext.
A set of context free grammar rules is designed to describe the basic form of allkinds of temporal expressions and a bottom-up chart parser is employed to parse tem-poral expressions.
Word segmentation is a preliminary step in many Chinese NLPapplications.
However, the performance of word segmentation is not perfect and itmay introduce some extra errors.
In our system, each possible combination of Chinesecharacters in a sentence will be looked up, and then all of the constituents are fed intothe char parser.
If the dictionaries are comprehensive enough, then all the possibleexplanations of all the possible combinations of characters can be gotten.
Ambiguitiesand overlaps between multiple temporal expressions are left to constraint rules andcombination rules.4.1   Temporal Grammar RulesA set of grammar rules is designed for each type of temporal expressions.
In order tocatch more temporal expressions, the grammar rules are given loosely.
Some pseudotemporal expressions may be introduced and this problem is addressed in the next698 M. Wu et alsection.Given these grammar rules, ?15?24?/15:24?
and ?15?24?39?/15:24:39?can be recognized.
In these examples, ?
?/o?clock?, ?
?/minute?, ??/second?
are allconstituents of the type ?Time_Unit?.Table 1.

Exp -> Time_Of_DayNo.2.

Even the domainis narrowed down to the temporal field, grammar rules are not enough to extract exacttemporal expressions.
There are some pseudo expressions which satisfy grammar rules,so constraint rules are designed to specify the true temporal expressions according to thecontext.
These constraint rules are developed by analyzing thedata set.A constraint rule will be triggered after the right part of the corresponding grammarrule is satisfied.
If the constraint rule is satisfied, then the grammar rule can be applied;otherwise, it cannot be applied.
Examples of constraint rules are shown in Table 2 andthe following two examples show the constraint checking procedure step by step.Table 2.
Examples of constraint rulesGrammar   rule 3:   Time_Base -> Time_Temp +Constraint  rule 3:   IF There is only one constituent of the type ?Time_Temp?,THEN the constituent ?Time_Unit?

Recognize the temporal expression successfully.In the first example ???/very?
is an adverb and has no temporal meaning.
How-ever the character ??/ten?
and ??/minute?
can be looked up and satisfy the grammarrule.
Constraint rules are necessary to filter the pseudo expression.4.3   Combination of Temporal ExpressionsBecause each possible substring in a sentence is tried, multiple nested, overlap oradjacent temporal expressions may exist in the sentence.
However, some of theseexpressions are just parts of the optimal answers.
So combination is necessary to getthe integrated temporal expression.
After applying grammar rules, if any two temporalexpressions are nested, overlapped or adjacent, our system will combine them andkeep the final result.
This procedure is shown by the following examples.
(3) ???????????????
(This train will arrive at Nan Chang next morning.
)First recognized temporal expressions are [?
?/tomorrow] and [?
?/morning].After the combination, the correct answer [???
?/next morning] will appear.
(4) ??8????????
(The basketball game starts at 8:00 p.m.)First recognized expressions are [?
?/night], [8?/8:00], [?
?8?/8:00 p.m.].The final result is [?
?8?/ 8:00 p.m.].4.4   Temporal/Non-temporal DisambiguationSome strings of characters are temporal expressions in given contexts, but in othercontexts they are not.
The context should be browsed to extract the true temporalexpressions.
Some constraint rules are designed to check the context and fulfill dis-ambiguation.
Three kinds of ambiguities are founded.
The first kind is the ambiguities700 M. Wu et alcaused by numbers, such as example 5.
In this case, the expression ?15?10?
containstemporal information, but in sports news messages it may be a score of a game.
Thesecond kind is the ambiguities caused by the combination of numbers and time units,such as ????.
In example 6, the expression ????
just refers to a football teammember.
However, in many news messages it is a date.
The third kind is the ambigui-ties caused by Chinese words, such as ???.
In example 7, the expression means ?for-mer?
and its explanations in other contexts may be ?in front of?.
(5) ??????15?10??????
(6) ??6????10?????????????
(7) ???????????????????????
?There are multiple explanations for the same one phrase or word, so ambiguitiesmay be caused.
To discriminate these expressions, heuristics for disambiguation areembedded in corresponding constraint rules.5   Normalizer Based on Mapping ProcedureThe goal of normalizer is to represent the temporal information of contained in tem-poral expressions, according to some standard.
The normalizer is based on the map-ping procedure, in which temporal expressions are explained and represented by val-ues of temporal attributes.
In this procedure, the objects number, unit, time and dura-tion are employed to store and represent temporal information.5.1   Introduction to NormalizationTERN 2004 evaluation [14] is a public evaluation on the extraction and normalizationof temporal expressions.
To evaluate our temporal parser in a real task, we expresstemporal information according to the standard of TERN 2004 evaluation.
Any tem-poral expression will be explained by a possible combination of the values of the sixattributes.
These attributes are described in table 3.Table 3.
Temporal attributesAttribute FunctionVAL Contains the value of a time or durationMOD Captures temporal modificationsSET Designates set-denoting expressionsANCHOR_VAL Contains a normalized form of the reference timeANCHOR_DIR Capture the relative direction/orientation between VALand ANCHOR_VALNON_SPECIFIC Designates a generic, essensially nonreferencial expression5.2   Normalization of Temporal ExpressionsAfter the procedure of extraction, the chart parser keeps all the applied grammar rulesand recognized intermediate constituents.
Semantic meanings of temporal expressionsCTEMP: A Chinese Temporal Parser 701can be achieved by the explanation of these grammar rules.
In this procedure, somebasic objects, such as ?number?, ?unit?, ?time?
and ?duration?, can be employed tostore and convey temporal information.
Applying grammar rules means creations orupdates of basic temporal objects.
Based on our temporal framework, we explain howto normalize the temporal expression extracted, i.e.
mapping the expressions to thevalues of six attributes.
The mapping procedure is different for different kinds oftemporal expressions.
A general description about the mapping procedure is shown inFig.

Mapping temporal expressions to attributesAccording to the classification scheme in Section 3.3, all temporal expressions canbe mapped to the six attributes.
The mapping procedures are complicated and selectedexamples are shown in Table 4.
It is difficult to tell whether a temporal expression is?specific?
or not, and few expressions are set a value at this attribute, we do not mapexpression to the attribute ?NON_SPECIFIC?.Table 4.
Examples of normalizationExpressions Attributes?
?/nowval="PRESENT_REF"anchor_val="2000-10-05" anchor_dir="AS_OF"?
?8?20?/20: 20 p.m. val="1999-04-26 T20:20"??
?/the next two years val="P2Y"anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING"??
?/every two days val="P2D" set="YES"???
?/ next afternoon val="2000-10-07TAF"?MOD?
attribute of temporal expressions may be set as ?YES?
if there are somemodifying descriptions about the expressions, such as ??
?/about?, ??
?/before?and so on.
So any kind of temporal expressions may be mapped on this attribute.?Set?
expressions can be explained as set of times, such as ??
?/each year?, or set ofdurations, such as ???
?/every two years?, so the attributes ?VAL?
and ?SET?
willbe filled.
?ANCHOR_VAL?
and ?ANCHOR_DIR?
refer to reference times and we702 M. Wu et aladopt the publishing times of news articles as the default reference times.
Event ex-pressions are relevant with a specific event and it is hard to represent the exact mean-ing of them.
In our system event expressions are not normalized.5.3   Time/Duration DisambiguationSometimes people omit a part of a full temporal expression for convenience in Chi-nese texts.
For example, ?4?/April?
and ?97?/ ?97?
are used to instead ?2000?4?/April, 2000?
and ?1997?/the year 1997?.
However, ?4?/four months?
and ?97?/97 years?
are also legal temporal expressions.
These temporal expressions are com-binations of numbers and common time units.
The first kind of explanations meansthese expressions are times and the second kind of explanations means they are dura-tions.
To get the correct values of temporal attributes for these temporal expressions,disambiguation is necessary.
Heuristic rules are employed for disambiguation, whichare shown in Table 5.Table 5.
Some heuristic rules for disambiguationIF a 3-digit or four-digit number is combined with the unit ?
?/year?, THEN thisexpression is time;IF a 2-digit number is combined with the unit ??/year?
and the number is biggerthat 70, THEN this expression is time.IF a 1-digit number is combined with the unit ?
?/year?,  THEN this expression isduration.6   Evaluation and AnalysisIn this section we report the results about evaluating our temporal parser on a manu-ally annotated corpus, which consist of 457 Chinese news articles.
The data collectioncontains 285,746 characters/142,872 words and 4,290 manually annotated temporalexpressions.
We will evaluate the boundaries of expressions and the values of the sixtemporal attributes.Table 6.
Experiment configurationExperiment No.
Conditions1 No constraints, combination of nested expressions2 No constraints, combination of nested, overlapped andadjacent expressions3 Constraints, combination of nested expressions4 Constraints, combination of nested, overlapped and adja-cent expressionsIn our temporal parser, we embedded constraints to restrict grammar rules.
In addi-tion, we combine the nested, overlapped and adjacent temporal expressions.
In Chi-nese, many temporal expressions contain nested temporal expressions.
If we do notCTEMP: A Chinese Temporal Parser 703combine these nested components into the optimal answer, there will be so manymismatched expressions.
So the combination of nested temporal expressions is neces-sary.
In the experiments, we try to evaluate two factors: the constraint rules, and thecombination of overlapped and adjacent temporal expressions.
Four experiments areset up, which are described in Table 6.
Given these conditions, the results of the ex-periments are shown in Table 7.Table 7.

We take part inTERN 2004 evaluation on Chinese temporal expression extraction and achieve thehighest performance in this task.
There is no public result on Chinese temporal ex-pression normalization, for reference we compare our normalization result of Experi-ment NO.
4 with the English normalization result in TERN 2004.
Our performance ismedium among their results.Table 7 compares the Precision, Recall and F-measure for different attributes indifferent experiments.
?TEXT?
means the performance of exact boundaries of tempo-ral expressions and other attributes are explained in Section 5.1.
For attributes?TEXT?
and ?VAL?, we achieve the highest performance in Experiment 4.
The F-scores are 0.849 and 0.768, respectively.
For other attributes, we also achieved nearlyhighest score in Experiment 4.
From the trend of performance on these two attributes,we can see the constraints and the procedure of combination have positive effects toperformance of the temporal parser, especially on ?TEXT?
and ?VAL?.
At the sametime, the procedure of combination is not significant to other attributes.
Based on theassumption that two adjacent or overlapped temporal expressions refer to the sametemporal concept, we combined them.
However, the procedure of combination cannot help to explain the meaning of the expressions.704 M. Wu et alAfter the evaluation we collect the errors of Experiment NO.

Wrong attribute values include missed, incorrect and spurious cases.
Thereason for errors on the attributes ?ANCHOR_VAL?
and ?ANCHOR_DIR?
is thatthe system did not give correct reference times.
Table 8 gives the error distributionsaccording to different attributes.
From this table, it can be seen that temporal Chinesewords and events are difficult to extract and normalize.Table 8.

We also propose a temporal frame-work, which include basic temporal objects and relations, the measurement and classi-fication of temporal expressions.
To cope with kinds of temporal expressions, con-straint rules are employed to retrieve genuine expressions and resolve ambiguities.The temporal parser CTEMP is fully implemented, which is based on the chart pars-ing and constraint checking scheme.
We have evaluated the temporal parser on amanually annotated corpus and achieved promising results of F-measures of 85.6% onextent and 76.8% on value.
We took part in TERN-2004 Chinese temporal expressionextraction with this parser and achieved the highest performance in that track.CTEMP: A Chinese Temporal Parser 705In our experiments the temporal parser is also evaluated with/without constraints,combination of nested and overlapped temporal expressions.
We find that constraintsare significant to the task extraction and normalization.
At the same time, combina-tion has positive influence on the task extraction.
Error analysis shows that temporalChinese words and events are more difficult to extract and normalize.
To improve theperformance of extraction, we plan to decide whether to keep any temporal Chinesewords as a genuine temporal expression automatically according to the contribution ofthe word.
We also plan to improve the performance of normalization by more precisesemantic explanation.AcknowledgementThe work presented in this paper is supported by Research Grants Council of HongKong (reference number: CERG PolyU 5085/02E and 5181/03E).References1.
