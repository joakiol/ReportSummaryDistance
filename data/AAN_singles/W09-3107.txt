As a case study we demonstrate theeffectiveness of this task on automaticallymining name translation pairs.
Starting from asmall set of seeds, we design a novel approachto acquire name translation pairs in a boot-strapping framework.
The experimental resultsshow this approach can generate highly accu-rate name translation pairs for persons, geo-political and organization entities.1 IntroductionAccurate name translation is crucial to manycross-lingual information processing tasks suchas information retrieval (e.g.
Ji et al, 2008).
Re-cently there has been heightened interest in dis-covering name pairs from comparable corpora(e.g.
Sproat et al, 2006; Klementiev and Roth,2006).
By comparable corpora we mean textsthat are about similar topics, but are not in gen-eral translations of each other.
These corpora arenaturally available, for example, many newsagencies release multi-lingual news articles onthe same day.
There are no document-level orsentence-level alignments across languages, butimportant facts such as names, relations andevents in one language in such corpora tend toco-occur with their counterparts in the other.However, most of the previous approachesused a phonetic similarity based name translitera-tion module as baseline to generate translationhypotheses, and then exploit the distribution evi-dence from comparable corpora to re-score thesehypotheses.
As a result, these approaches arelimited to names which are phonetically translit-erated (e.g.
translate Chinese name ????
(Youshen ke)?
to ?Yushchenko?
in English).
But manyother types of names such as organizations areoften rendered semantically, for example, theChinese name ?????
(jie fang zhi hu)?
istranslated into ?Liberation Tiger?
in English.Furthermore, many name translations are contextdependent.
For example, a person name ?????????
?
should be translated into ?YasserArafat (PLO Chairman)?
or ?Yasir Arafat(Cricketer)?
based on different contexts.Information extraction (IE) techniques ?
iden-tifying important entities, relations and events ?are currently available for some non-English lan-guages.
In this paper we define a new notion ?bi-lingual information networks?
which can be ex-tracted from comparable corpora.
An informationnetwork is a set of directed graphs, in which eachnode is a named entity and the nodes are linkedby various ?attributes?
such as hometown, em-ployer, spouse etc.
Then we align the informa-tion networks in two languages automatically ina bootstrapping way to discover name translationpairs.
For example, after we extract bilingualFigure 1.

- Montesinos(2)?, align the arrest place of Montesinos as ???
?-Callao (3)?, and then align the location ofCallao as ??
?-Peru (4)?.
Using this approachwe can discover name pairs of various types(person, organization and location) while mini-mizing using supervised name transliterationtechniques.
At the same time, we can providelinks among names for entity disambiguation.2 General ApproachFigure 2 depicts the general procedure of ourapproach.
The language pair that we are consid-ering in this paper is Chinese and English.
Weapply IE techniques to extract information net-works (more details in section 3), then use abootstrapping algorithm to align them and dis-cover name pairs (section 4).Figure 2.
Name Translation Mining Overview3 Information Network Creation3.1 Bilingual Information ExtractionWe apply a state-of-the-art bilingual informationextraction system (Chen and Ji, 2009; Ji andGrishman, 2008) to extract ACE1 types of enti-ties, relations and events from the comparablecorpora.
Both systems include name tagging,1 http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tests/ace/nominal mention tagging, coreference resolution,time expression extraction and normalization,relation extraction and event extraction.
Entitiesinclude persons, geo-political (GPE) and organi-zations; Relations include 18 types (e.g.
?a townsome 50 miles south of Salzburg?
indicates alocated relation.
); Events include the 33 distinctevent types defined in ACE05 (e.g.
?Barry Dil-ler on Wednesday quit as chief of Vivendi?
indi-cates that ?Barry Diller?
is the person argumentof a quit event occurred on Wednesday).
The re-lation extraction and event extraction compo-nents produce confidence values.3.2 Attribute ConversionThen we construct a set of directed graphs foreach language { }( , )i i iG G V E=  , where iV  isthe collection of named entities, and iE  is theedges linking one name to the other, labeled bythe attributes derived from the following twosources: (1) We select the relations with morestatic types to form specific attributes in Table 22,according to the entity types of a linked namepair.
(2) For each extracted event we compose anattribute by combining its type and time argu-ment (e.g.
the ?Arrest/2001-06-25?
link in Figure1).
As we will see in the next section, these at-tributes are the key to discover name translationsfrom the information networks because they arelanguage-independent.4 Information Network AlignmentAfter creating the information networks fromeach language, we automatically align them todiscover name translation pairs.
The general ideais that starting from a small seed set of commonname pairs, we can rely on the link attributes toalign their related names.
Then the new nametranslations are added to the seed set for the nextiteration.
We repeat this bootstrapping procedureuntil no new translations are produced.
We startfrom names which are frequently linked to othersso that we can traverse through the informationnetworks efficiently.
For example, the seed set inprocessing ACE newswire data includes famousnames such as ?Indonesia?, ?China?, ?Palestine?,?Sharon?
and ?Yugoslavia?.For each name pair <CHName, EName>, wesearch for all its related pairs <CHName?,2 Many of these attributes are consistent with the definitionsin NIST TAC-KBP task: http://apl.jhu.edu/~paulmac/kbp/090220-KBPTaskGuidelines.pdfInformation Network AlignmentInformationNetwork CreationChinese CorporaChinese IEEnglish CorporaEnglish IEChinese Infor-mation NetworkEnglish Infor-mation NetworkAttribute Conversion Attribute ConversionHigh-ConfidenceName PairsGraph Traverse based onConfidence EstimationSeedName Pairsbootstrapping35Name?NamePerson Geo-political OrganizationPerson Spouse, Parent, Child, Sibling Birth-Place, Death-Place,Resides-Place, NationalitySchools-Attended, EmployerGeo-political Leader Located-Country, Capital -Organization Leader Location -Table 2.

Table 3 showsthe number of documents from different newsagencies and time frames.
We hold out 20 ACEtexts from each language to optimize the thresh-olds of confidence values in section 4.
A namepair <CHName, EName> is judged as correct ifboth of them are correctly extracted and one isthe correct translation of the other in the certaincontexts of the original documents.5.2 Overall PerformanceTable 4 shows the number and accuracy of nametranslation pairs discovered from CH-Set3 andEN-Set3, using 100 name pairs as seeds.
Afterfour iterations we discovered 968 new nametranslation pairs with accuracy 82.9%.
Amongthem there are 361 persons (accuracy 76.4%),384 geo-political names (accuracy 87.5%) and223 organization names (accuracy 85.2%).Iteration 1 2 3 4Number of Name Pairs 205 533 787 968Accuracy (%) 91.8 88.5 85.8 82.9Table 4.
Overall Performance5.3 Impact of Time Frame and NewsSource SimilarityOne major evidence exploited in the prior workis that the bilingual comparable corpora shouldbe weakly temporally aligned.
For example,Klementiev and Roth (2006) used the time dis-tribution of names to re-score name translitera-tion.
In order to verify this observation, we in-vestigated how well our new approach can per-form on comparable corpora with different timeframes.
Table 5 presents the performance of twocombinations: CHSet1-ENSet1 (from the sametime frame) and CHSet1-ENSet2 (from differenttime frames) with a seed set of 10 name pairsafter 5 iterations.Corpora CHSet1-ENSet1 CHSet1-ENSet2Number ofName Pairs42 17Accuracy (%) 81.0 76.5Table 5.
Impact of Time Frame SimilarityIn addition, in order to measure the impact ofnews source similarity, we apply our approach tothe combination of CHSet3 and ENSet4 whichare from different news agencies.
In total 815name pairs are discovered after 4 iterations withoverall accuracy 78.7%, which is worse than theresults from the corpora of the same news sourceas shown in Table 4.
Therefore we can clearlysee that time and news source similarities are36important to the performance of name translationpair mining.5.4 Impact of IE ErrorsSince in our approach we used the fully auto-matic IE pipeline to create the information net-works, the errors from each component will bepropagated into the alignment step and thus limitthe performance of name translation discovery.For example, Chinese name boundary detectionerrors caused about 30% of the incorrect namepairs.
As a diagnostic analysis, we tried to dis-cover name pairs from CHSet1 and ENSet1 butwith perfect IE annotations.
We obtained 63name pairs with a much higher accuracy 90.5%.6 Related WorkMost of the previous name translation workcombined supervised transliteration approacheswith Language Model based re-scoring (e.g.
Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Huang et al, 2004).Ji et al (2009) described various approaches toautomatically mine name translation pairs fromaligned phrases (e.g.
cross-lingual Wikipediatitle links) or aligned sentences (bi-texts).
Ourapproach of extracting and aligning informationnetwork from comparable corpora is related tosome prior work using comparable corpora to re-score name transliterations (Sproat et al, 2006;Klementiev and Roth, 2006).In this paper we extend the target names frompersons to geo-political and organization names,and extract relations links among names simulta-neously.
And we use a bootstrapping approach todiscover name translations from the bilingualinformation networks of comparable corpora.
Inthis way we don?t need to have a name translit-eration module to serve as baseline, or computedocument-wise temporal distributions.7 Conclusion and Future WorkWe have described a simple approach to createbilingual information networks and then discovername pairs from comparable corpora.
The ex-periments on Chinese and English have shownthat this method can generate name translationpairs with high accuracy by using a small seedset.
In the short term, our approach will provide aframework for many byproducts and directlybenefit other NLP tasks.
For example, thealigned sub-graphs with names, relations andevents can be used to improve information re-dundancy in cross-lingual question answering;the outlier (mis-aligned) sub-graphs can be usedto detect the novel or local information describedin one language but not in the other.In the future we plan to import more efficientgraph mining and alignment algorithms whichhave been widely used for protein-protein inter-action detection (Kelley et al, 2003).
In addition,we will attempt using unsupervised relation ex-traction based on lexical semantics to replace thesupervised IE pipeline.
More importantly, wewill investigate the tradeoff between coverageand accuracy by applying the generated namepairs to cross-lingual name search and machinetranslation tasks.AcknowledgmentsThis material is based upon work supported bythe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencyunder Contract No.
