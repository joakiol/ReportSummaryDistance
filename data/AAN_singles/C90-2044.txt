Disambiguating Cue Phrases in Text and SpeechDiane Litman and Julia Hirschberg*AT&T Bell LaboratoriesMurray Hill NJ 07974 USAdiane@research.att.com, julia@research.att.comAbst ractCue phrases are linguistic expressions uch as 'now'and 'welg that may explicitly mark the structure ofa discourse.
For example, while the cue phrase 'in-czdcntally' may be used SENTENTIALLY as an adver-bial, the DISCOUaSE use initiates a digression.
In\[8\], we noted the ambiguity of cue phrases with re-spect to discourse and sentential usage and proposedan intonational model for their disambiguation.
Inthis paper, we extend our previous characterizationof cue phrases aald generalize its domain of coverage,based on a larger and more comprehensive empiricalstudy: an examination of all cue phrases produced bya single ,~peaker in recorded natural speech.
We alsoassociate this prosodic model with orthographic andpart-of-speech analyses of cue phrases in text.
Sucha dual model provides both theoretical justificationfor current computational models of discourse andpractical application to the generation of syntheticspeech.1 In t roduct ionWords and phrases that may directly mark thestructure of a discourse have been termed CUEPttR.ASES, CLUE WORDS,  DISCOURSE MAI:tKERS~ aridDISCOURSE PARTICLES \[3, 4, 14, 17, 19\].
Some exarn-pies are 'now', which marks the introduction of a newsubtopic or return to a previous one, 'incidentally'and 'by the way', which indicate the beginning of a di-gression, and 'anyway' and 'in any case', which indi-cate return from a digression.
In a previous tudy\[8\],we noted that such terms are potentially ambiguousbetween DISCOURSE and SENTENTIAL uses\[18\].
So,'now' may be used as a temporal adverbial as wellas a discourse marker, 'incidentally' may also func-tion as an adverbial, and other cue phrases imilarlyhave one or more senses in addition to their func-tion as markers of discourse structure.
Based uponan empiricM study of 'now' in recorded speech, weproposed that such discourse and sentential uses ofcue phrases can be disambiguated intonationally.
Inparticular, we proposed a prosodic model for this dis-ambiguation which discriminated all discourse from*We thank Bengt Altenberg, l=tichaa-d Omanson  mid Janvan Santen for providing information and helpful commentson this work.sentential uses of tokens in our sample.
This modelprovided not only a plausibility argument for the dis-ambiguation of cue phrases, but also the beginningsof a model for the generation of cue phrases in syn-thetic speech.In this paper, we show that our prosodic modelgeneralizes to other cue phrases as well.
We furtherpropose an initial model for the disambiguation ofcuc phrases in text.
Wc base these claims upon afurther empirical study: an examination of all cuephrases produced by a single speaker in part of arecorded, transcribed lecture.
In Section 2 we reviewour own and other work on cue phrases, in Section3 we describe our current empirical studies, in Sec-tion 4 we present he results of our analysis, and inSection 5 we discuss theoretical and practical appli-cations of our findings.2 Prev ious  S tud iesThe important role that cue phrases play in under-standing and generating discourse has been well doc-umented in the computational linguistics literature.For example, by indicating the presence of a struc-tural boundary or a relationship between parts of adiscourse, cue phrases caa assist in the resolution ofanaphora\[5, 4, 17\] and in the identification of rhetor-ical relations \[10, 12, 17\].
Cue phrases have alsobeen used to reduce the complexity of discourse pro-cessing and to increase textual coherence\[3, 11, 21\].In Example (1) 1, interpretation of the anaphor 'it'as (correctly) co-indexed with THE SYSTEM is facil-itated by the presence of the cue phrases 'say' and'then', marking potential antecedents in '... as anEXPERT DATABASE for AN EXPERT SYSTEM ... ' asstructurally unavailable.
2(1) "If THE SYSTEM attenqpts to hold rules, say asAN EXPERT DATABASE for  AN EXPERT SYSTEM,then we expect it not only to hold the rules butto in fact apply them for us in appropriate situ-ations.
"1The examples are taken from the corpus described in Sec-tion 3.2InformMly, 'say' indicates the beginning of a discoursesubtopic and 'then' signals a return from that  subtopic.251 1Previous attempts to define the set of cue phraseshave typically been extensional, 3 with such lists ofcue phrases then further classified as to their dis-course function.
For example, Cohen \[3\] uses a tax-onomy of connectives based on that of Quirk \[16\] toassociate with each class of cue phrases a semanticfunction with respect o a model of argument under-standing.
Grosz and Sidner \[4\] classify cue phrasesbased on changes to the attentional stack and inten-tional structure found in their theory of discourse.Schiffrin \[18\] classifies cue phrases into groups basedon their sentential usage (e.g.
conjunctive, adver-bial, and clausal markers), while Reichman \[17\] andIlobbs\[10\] associate groups of cue phrases with therhetorical relationships they signal.
Finally, Zuker-man \[21\] presents a taxonomy of cue phrases basedon three functions relevant o her work in languagegeneration: knowledge organization, knowledge ac-quisition, and affect maintenance.Once a cue phrase has been identified, however, itis not always clear whether to interpret it as a dis-course marker or not\[6, 4, 8, 18\].
The texts in Exam-pie (2) are potentially ambiguous between a temporalreading of 'now' and a discourse interpretation:(2) a.
"Now in AI our approach is to look at aknowledge base as a set of symbolic itemsthat represent something."b.
"Now some of you may suspect from thetitle of this talk that this word is coming toyou from Krypton or some other possibleworld.
"On the temporal reading, (2a), for example, wouldconvey that 'at this moment the AI approach toknowledge bases has changed'; on the discourse read-ing, 'now' simply initiates the topic of 'the AI ap-proach to knowledge bases'.It has been suggested that this difference betweendiscourse and sententiai use may be intonationallydisambiguable.
Halliday and Hassan \[6\] claim that,in general, items used COtIES1VELY - -  i.e., to relateone part of a text to another \[6, p. 4\] - -  tend tobe intonationally non-prominent ( o be unaccentedand reduced) unless they are "definitely contrastive".Non-cohesive uses, on the other hand, are indicatedby non-reduced, accented forms.\[6, p. 268\] ttallidayand llassan particularly note that intonation disam-biguates in this way between cohesive (discourse) andnon-cohesive (sentential) uses of classes of items weterm cue phrases, such as conjunctions and adver-bials.
Empirical studies to date have tended to bearout their observations.
Studies of portions of theLondon-Lund corpus such as \[1\] have provided into-national profiles of word classes including DISCOURSEITEMS, conjunctions and adverbials which are at leastcompatible with these views.
However, the notion of'discourse item' used appears much more restrictive3An exception to this is found in the socio-linguistic workof Schifl'rin\[18\].than the notion of 'cue phrase', 4 so it is difficult tomake comparative use of these results.In an earlier study \[8\], we examined the use ofvarious intonational, syntactic, and orthographic fea-tures to distinguish between discourse and senten-tim readings of a single cue phrase ('now').
5 Whilefeatures uch as tense, structural configuration, sur-face order, and orthographic indicators were some-times useful, we found that intonational featuresprovided only only significant correlation with dis-course/sentential status.
All of the tokens in oursample were disarnbiguable in terms of intonationalphrasing and type of pitch accentfiIn our study of now, we found that discourseuses were either uttered as a single intermediatephrase (or in a phrase containing only cue phrases)(Discourse Type A), or uttered at the beginning ofa longer intermediate phrase (or preceded only byother cue phrases in the phrase) and with a L* pitchaccent or without a pitch accent (Discourse Type B).Cue phrases judged to be of Sentential Type werenever uttered as a single phrase; if first in interme-diate phrase they were nearly always uttered with aH* or complex pitch accent (Sentential Type A); ifnot first in phrase they could bear any type of pitchaccent or be deaccented (Sentential Type B).
Theseresults are summarized in Figure I.Based on these findings, we proposed that listenersuse prosodic information to disambiguate discoursefrom sentential uses of cue phrases.
To investigatethis possibility further, we conducted another multi-speaker study of discourse and sentential uses of thecue phrase 'welt.
Our findings were alrnost identicalto results for the earlier study; briefly, of the 52 in-4 For example,  in the 48 minute text Altenberg examines, hefinds only 23 discourse items, or about  17% of what our studyof a similar corpus (described below) would have predicted.Our  corpus consisted of recordings of four days of tile radiocall-in program "The Harry Gross Show: Speaking of YourMoney," recorded ur ing the week of 1 February 1982115\].
Thefour shows provided approximately ten hours of conversationbetween expert(s) m~d callers.6For the earlier study as well as the current  one, we assumePierrehumbel~,'s\[13\] system of phonological description.
Inthis system, intonat ional  contours are described as sequencesof low (L) and h igh  (H) tones in the FuraDAM~NTAL errs.QUENCV (F0) CONTOUrt.
P i t ch  accents ,  peaks or valleys inthe F0 contour that  fall on the stressed syllables of lexicalitems, signify intonat ional  prominence.
A pitch accent con-sists either of a single tone or an ordered pair of tones, suchas L*+H.
The tone aligned with the stressed syllable is in-dicated by a star *; thus, in an L*+H accent, the low toneL* is aligned with the stressed syUahle.
There are six pitchaccents in English: two simple tones - -  H and L --  and fourcomplex ones - -  L*+H,  L+H* ,  H*+L,  and H+L* .
A well-formed in termed ia te  phrase  consists of one or more p i tchaccents ,  and a simple lfigh H or low L tone that  representsthe phrase  accent .
The phrase accent controls the pitch be-tween the last pitch accent of the current intermediate plwaseand the beginning of the next  - -  or the end of the utterance.Intonational phrases are larger phonological milts, com-posed of one of more intermediate phrases, plus a boundarytone  which may also be H or L. The occurrence of phraseaccents and boundary  tones, together with other phrase-froMcharacterist ics such as passes  aald syllable lengthening,  enableus to identify intermediate mad intonat ional  phrases.2 252Figure 1: Prosodic Characteristics of Discourse and Sentential UsesCue PhrasesSentential recourseBInitial in Larger Phrase Non-Initial in Alone in Initial in Larger PhraseH or Complex Accent Larger Phrase Phrase Deaccented or L Accentstances of 'well' we examined, all but one token fitthe model depicted in Figure 1.To see whether these findings could be extended tocue phrases in general, we began a third study - -  ofall cue phrases produced by a single speaker during75 minutes of recorded speech.
The remainder of thispaper describes our first results from this study.3 The  DataTo test whether our prosodic model of discourse andsentential uses of 'now' and 'well' extended to cuephrases in general, we examined intonational chm'-acteristics of all single-word cue phrases 7 used in akeynote, address given by I~onald Brachman at theFirst lnlernalional Conference on Expert DatabaseSyslems in 1986.
The address provides approxi-mately 75 minutes of speech t?om a single speaker.For our first sample, we examined the 211 cuephrases uttered during the first 17 minutes of theaddress.
Our tokens had the following distribution: sactually (6), also (2), although (1), and (68), basically(1), because (2), but (12), finally (1), \]i,'sl (1), further(4), however (2), like (11), look (11), next (4), now(26), ok (1), or (19), say (12), second (1), see (5),since (1), so (9), then (3), therefore (1), well (7) .To determine the classification of each token (ms-COURSE,  SENTENTIAL,  or  AMBIGUOUS) ,  the authorsseparately .judged each token by listening to thetaped address while marking a transcription.
9rWe exmnined o~fly single-word cue plu, asea in tiffs s tudysince our current  prosodic model  applies only to such items.In future work we plan to develop addit ional models for dis-course a~nL(l aententiel uses of mult l -word cue phrases, e.g 'thatreminds me', 'first o\] all', 'speaking off and so on.8Our set of cue phrases was derived from extensional def-init ions provided by ourselves and othel~\[3, 4, 17, 18, 21\].T im following lexicel i tems, a l though also cue phrases, arenot present in the port ion of the axlch-ess examined to date:' alright', 'alternatively', 'anyway', %oy', ~ conversely', ' exeepf ,'fine', '\]urthermore', 'incidentally', 'indeed', 'listen', 'more-over', 'nah', 'nevertheless', 'no' ,  'oh', 'right', 'why', 'yeah',~yes'.9The address was transcr ibed independent ly  of our s tudyby a meraber  of the text processing pool at AT&T Bell Lab-oratories.
We found that  20 cite phrases had been omittedby the traalscriber: 'and', 'now', 'ok', 'so',  and 'well'.
Signif-icantly, ell but  two of these were termed 'discourse' uses byIn comparing our judgments, we were interested inareas of disagreement as well as agreement.
The setof tokens whose classification as to discourse or sen-tential use we agreed upon provide a testbed for ourcontinuing investigation of the intonational disam-biguation of cue phrases.
The set of tokens we founddifficult to classify (i.e.
those tokens we both foundambiguous or those whose cla.ssification we disagreedupon), provide insight into possible intonational cor-relates of discourse/sentential ambiguity.
"Fable 1presents the distribution of our judgments, where'classifiable' represent those tokens whose classifica-tion we agreed upon and 'unclassifiable' representsthose we both found ambiguous or disagreed upon.Table 1: Judgments by Type of Cue Phrase, N=211I Type Unclassifiable All 78 Conj 57 Non-Conj 21 Classifial, le laa 2LELHOf the 211 tokens in this initial sample, we foundonly 133 cue phrases (63.03%) to be unambigu-ously discourse or sentential.
When we looked moreclosely at the 'unclassifiable' cases, we found thatfully 73.08% were coordinate conjunctions (and, or,and but).
In fact, when we compare percent classifi-able for conjunctions with other cue phrases, we findthat, while only 42.42% of conjunctions were foundto be classifiable, fully 81.25% of non-conjunctionswere classified.
Thus, the case of coordinate con-junction appears to explain a large portion of theour difficulty in agreeing upon a classification.Once we had made these judgments, we analyzedthe tokens for their prosodic and syntactic featuresas well ms their orthographic context, much as we haddone with tokens for the earlier two studies./?
Wenoted whether each token was accented or not and,if accented, we noted the type of accent employed.We also identified the composition of the intermedi-both judges.1?We used a pitch tracker written by David Telkin andTalkin's Waves speech analysis software\[20\] in our prosodicanalysis.253 3ate phrase containing each token as to whether thetoken constituted a separate phrase (possibly withother cue phrases) or not.
And we noted each token'sposition within its intermediate phrase - -  first (in-cluding tokens preceded only by other cue phrases) ornot.
We also noted syntactic haracteristics of eachitem, including part of speech and its immediatelydominating constituent, n Finally, we noted ortho-graphic indicators in the transcript which might pro-vide disambiguation, such as immediately precedingand  succeeding punctuation and paragraph bound-aries.
In both the syntactic and orthographic analy-ses we were particularly interested in discovering howwell non-prosodic features which might be obtainedautomatically from a text would do in differentiatingdiscourse from sentential uses.4 The Single-Speaker/Mult i -Cue Phrase StudyOur findings from the classified data (133 tokens) inthis pilot study confirmed our model of prosodic dis-tinction between discourse and sentential uses of cuephrases.
The distribution of these judgments withrespect o the prosodic model of discourse and sen-tential cue phrases depicted in Figure 1 is shown inTable 2.
Recall that this model includes two intona-Table 2: Prosody of Classified Tokens, N=133Judgment ProsodyDiscourse SententialDiscourse .... 44 4Sentential 17 .... 68(X 2 = 63.46, df --- 1, p <.001)tional profiles for discourse uses: Discourse Type A,in which a cue phrase constitutes an entire interme-diate phrase (or is in a phrase containing only othercue phrases) and may have any type of pitch accent;Discourse Type B, in which a cue phrase occurs atthe beginning of a larger intermediate phrase (or ispreceded only by other cue phrases) and bears a L*pitch accent or is deaccented; Sentential Type A, inwhich the cue phrase occurs at the beginning of alarger phrase and bears a H* or complex pitch ac-cent; and Sentential Type B, in which the cue phraseoccurs in non-initial position in a larger phrase.
Nownote in Table 2 that the ratio of discourse to senten-tial usage was about 1:2.
Of the 44 tokens judgedto represent discourse use and fitting our prosodicmodel, one third were of Discourse Type A and two-thirds of Discourse Type B.l lWe used Hindie's parser Fidditch\[7\] to obtain con-stituent structure and Fidditch aaid Church's part-of-speechprogram\[2\] for part of speech assignment.While overall results are quite significant, the 17items judged sentential which nonetheless fit the dis-course prosodic model must be explained.
Of these17, 14 (representing two thirds of the total error)are conjuncts (11 'and's and 3 '0r's) which fit thetype (b) discourse prosodic model.
While all are thusfirst in intermediate phrase - -  and, in fact, in into-national phrase - -  none are utterance-initial.
Bothjudges found such items relatively difficult to distin-guish between discourse and sentential use.

"The difficulty in such cases appears confined to in-stances ofsentential coordination where the conjunctis not utterance initial.

Our model thus predicts 93.4% of non-Table 3: Prosod.y of Classified Non-Conjuncts, N=91Judgment Prosody" Discourse SententialDiscourse 36 3Sentential 3' 49(X 2 = 68.15, df = 1, p <.0Ol)conjunct cue phrase distinctions, as opposed to the84.2% success rate shown in Table 2.Our prosodic model itself can of course be de-composed to examine the contributions of individualfeatures to discourse/sentential judgments.

There is even more agreement when cuephrases appear in non-initial position in a larger in-termediate phrase (NONF* - -  Sentential type B inl~See Section 3.

Note that four cells (ONFD, ONFH, ONFL, andONFC) are empty, since all items alone in their intermediatephrase must perforce come frrst in it.254 4Table 4: Prosodic Feature Configurations and Judgments, N=211OFDOFI IAll Tokens8% Judged Discourse100.0050.00% Judged Sentential037.50% Unchussifiable12.50OFL 30 60.00 0 40.00OFC 9 77.78 22.22ONFDONFHONFLONFCNOFDNOFIt00NANANANA8.4711.1142.86..... 50.0000NA59NOFL '21NOFC 4NONFDNONFIINANANA22.0355.564.7650.0089.2994.44NA2836NONFL .

How-ever, tokens which fit Discourse type B in Figure 1(first in a larger phrase and deaccented (NOFD) orwith a L* (NOFL)) appear more problematic: of theformer, there was disagreement on fiflly two thirds) 4While there is more agreement that tokens charac-terized as NOFIt (first in a larger phrase with a H*accent) or NOFC (same with a complex pitch accent)-- Sentential type A in Figure 1 --- are sentential,this agreement is certainly less striMng than in thecase of tokens characterized a,s NONF* (non-initialil~ a larger phrase with any type of pitch accent - -Sentential type B).
Since Discourse type B and Sen-tcntial type A differ only in 'type of pitch accent', wewight conclude that the pitch accent feature is notas powerfid a discriminator as the phrasal features'alone in intermediate phrase' or 'first in phrase'.As in our previous tudy, we also examined poten-tial non-prosodic distinctions between discourse andsentential uses.
Of the orthographic and syntacticfi:atures we examined, we found presence or absenceof preceding punctuation and part-of-speech to bemost successful in distinguishing discourse from sen-tential uses.
For the 113 tokens on which both judgesagreed a.s to discourse or sentential status, 1~ orthog-ral)hy distinguishes between discourse and sententialuse in 101 (89.4%) of cases.
Specifically, 21 of 30discourse uses are preceded by punctuation and only3 of 83 sentential items.We also tbund that part-of-speech distinguishesdiscourse from sentential use, although less success-fully than orthography.
If we simply predict dis-course or se.ntential use by the assignment most fre-quently associated with a given part-of-speech, both14And note that 91.3% of items in these two cells m'econjmlcts.15Thls figm~ excludes those items which the transcriberomitted.Church's part-of-speech algorithm and Hindle's Fid-ditch predict discourse or sentential use in approx-imately 75% of cases where both judges agreed ondiscourse/sentential assigmnent.
For example, weassume that since the majority of conjunctions andverbs are judged sentential that these parts-of-speechare predictors ofsentential status, and since most ad-verbials are associated with discourse uses, these arepredictors of discourse status, and so on.
While part-of-speech thus might seem less useful than ortho-graphic distinctions for our corpus, the fact that it isnot subject to transcriber idiosyncracy might makeit a more reliable predictor than orthographic indica-tors in the general case.
Too, for text-to-speech ap-plications, in which one would like to infer discourseor sentential use in order to employ the appropriateintonational features when synthesizing the item inquestion, these text-based results are encouraging.5 Discuss ionOur findings for the first stage of our single-speakermulti-cue phrase study support the intonationalmodel of discourse/sentential characteristics of cuephrases which we proposed in \[8\].
Discourse usesof cue phrases fell into two groups: in one, thecue phrase was set apart as a separate intermedi-ate phrase (possibly with other cue phrases); in theother, the cue phrase was first in its intermediatephrase (possibly preceded by other cue phrases) andeither was deaccented or bore a L* pitch accent.Sentential uses were in general part of a larger in-termediate phrase: if first in phrase, they bore a H*or complex pitch accent.
The association betweendiscourse/sentential models and discourse/sententialjudgments is significant at the .0(/1 level.
We alsofound that the tokens we found difficult to clas-255  5sify were those in which disambiguation relied solelyupon pitch accent, rather than some combination ofpitch accent and phrasing.
Furthermore, we foundthat orthographic ues (from transcription) success-fully disarnbiguate between discourse and sententialusage in 89.4% of cases in our pilot study.
Part-of-speech was less successful in distinguishing dis-course from sentential use, disambiguating only 75%of cases in the study.The disambiguating power of both our textual andour prosodic models has both theoretical and prac-tical import.
From a practical point of view, theconstruction of both text-based and prosodic modelspermit improvement in the generation of syntheticspeech from unrestricted text \[9\].
With a prosodicmodel, we know how to convey discourse/sententialdistinctions; with a text-based model, we knowwhen to convey such distinctions.
From a theo-retical point of view, our findings demonstrate thefeasibility of cue phrase disambiguation i  both textand speech and provide a model for how that disam-biguation might be done.
Furthermore, these resultsstrengthen the claim that the discourse structurescrucial to computational models of interaction canindeed be identified.References\[1\] Bengt Alteuberg.
