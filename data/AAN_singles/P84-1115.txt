AN INT~ATIONAL DELPHI POLL ON FUTURE TRENDSIN "INFORMATION LINGUISTICS"Rainer KuhlenUniversitast KonstanzInformationswissenschaftBox 6650D-7750 Konstanz I, West GermanyABSTRACTThe results of an international Delphi poll oninformation linguistics which was carried outbetween 1982 and 1983 are presented.As part of conceptual work being done ininformation science at the University of Constancean international Delphi poll wss carried out from1982 to 1983 with the aim of establishing amid-term pro@aosis for the development of"information linguistics".
The term "informationlinguistics" refers to a scientific disciplinecombining the fields of linguistic data processing,applied computer science, linguistics, artificialintelligence, and information science.
A Delphipoll is a written poll of experts - carried out inthis case in two phases.
The results of the firstround were incorporated into the second round, sothat participants in the poll could react to thetrends as they took shape.I.
Some demoscopic dataI.
I Return rateBased on sophisticated selection procedures 385international experts in the field of informationlinguistics were determined and were sentquestionnaires in the first round (April1982).
90 questionnaires were returned.
In thesecond round 360 questionnaires were mailedout (January 1983) and 56 were returned, 48 ofthese from experts who had answered in the firstround.
The last questionnaires were accepted at theend of June 1 983.Overlapping data in the two roundsfirst round (90) second round (56)2 48 8In the following we refer to four sets of data:Set A 90 from round ISet--B 48 from round I with answers in round 28et--C 56 from round 2Set--D 48 from round 2 with answers in round IBut we shall concentrate primarily on Set C becanse- according to the Delphi philosophy - t~e data ofthe second round are the most relevant.
Therewere 8 persons within Set C who did not answer inthe first round.
But the~ also were aware ofthe results of the first round; therefore aDelphi effect was possible.

Question answering and understanding Qusystems2.2 Single topicsThe sub-areas included a varying number of topics(from 6 to 15).
These topics were chosen basedon the author's experience in information linguis-tics, on a pretest with mostly German researchersand practitioners, on advices from members ofFID/LD, and on long discussions with Don Walker,Hans Karlgren, and Udo Hahn.
Altogether, therewere 91 topics in the first round and 90 in thesecond round, as follows:.acl Segmentation of Acoustic Inputac2 Speaker Dependent Speech Recognitionac3 Speaker Independent Speech Recognitionac4 Speech Understandingac5 Identification of Intonational/Prosodic Infor-mation with respect to Syntaxac6 Identification of Intonational/Prosodic Infor-mation with respect to Semanticsac7 Automatic Speech Synthesismolmo2mo3mo4mo5mo6motmo8mo9mol 0mol IAutomatic Correction of Incomplete or FalseInputAnalysis of Incomplete or Irregular InputMorphological Analysis (Reduction Algorithms)Automatic Determination of Parts of SpeechAutomatic Analysis of ?unctions& NotionsPartial Parsing Recognition TechniquesPartial Parsing Transformation TechniquesRecognition of Syntactic ParaphrasesReco~ition of Textual ParaphrasesQuestion RecognitionGr i t s  of Syntactic Parsing of UnrestrictedNatural Language Inputsel Semantic Classification of Verbs or Predicatesse2 Or6mnizin6 Domain-Specific ?tame/Script-TypeStructuresse3 Semantically Guided Parsingse4 Semantic Parsing541se5 Knowledge Acquisitionse6 Analysis of Quantifiersse7 Analysis of Deictic Expressionsse8 Analysis of Anaphoric/Cataphoric Expressions(Pronominalization)se9 Processing of Temporal Expressionsse10 Establishment of Text Cohesion and TextCoherencesel I Recognition of Argumentation Patternsse12 Management of Vague and Incomplete Knowledgeset3 Automatic Management of Plansset4 Formalizing Speech Act Theoryse15 Processing of "Unpr~m~tical" Inputhal Personal Computers for Linguistic Proceduresha2 Parallel Processing Systemsha3 New Mass Memory Technologiesha4 Associative Memoryha5 Terminal Supportha6 Hardware Realization of NatnAral LangusgeAnalysis Proceduresha7 Communication Networkssol Standard Progr~,mi ng Languages for InformationLinguisticsso2 Development of Modular Standard Programs(Hardware-Independent)so3 Natural Language ProgrPJ,mingso4 Parallel Processing Techniquesso5 Alternative File Organizationso6 New Database System Architecture for thePurpose of Information Linguisticsso7 Flexible Data Management Systemsi11 Compatibility of Documentation Languages inDistributed Networksil2 Enrichment of Information Languages byStatistical Relationsll3 Enrichment of Information/DocumentationLa~s  by Linguistic Semanticsil4 Enrichment of Higher Documentation Languagesby Artificial Intelligence Methodsil5 Standardization of Information/DocumentationLanguagesil6 Documentation Languages for Non-Textual Datail7 Information/Documentation Languages forHeterogeneous Domainslib Determination of Linguistic Relationsil9 Adaptation of Ordinary Language DictionaryDatabasesill0 (cancelled in the second round)ill I Statistical Models of Domain-SpecificScientific Languagesinl Improvement of Automatic Indexing byMorphological Reduction Algorithmsin2 Improvement of Automatic Indexing bySyntactic Analysisin3 Improvement of Automatic Indexing bySemantic Approachesin4 Probabilistic Methods of Indexingin5 Indexing Functionsin6 Automatic Indexing of Full-textsabl Abstracting Methodolo~ab2 Automatic Extractingab3 Automatic Indicative Abstractingab4 Automatic Informative Abstractingab5 Automatic Positional Abstractingab6 Graphic Representation of Text Structurestrl Development of Sophisticated Multi-LingualLexiconstr2 Automatic Translation of Restricted Inputtr3 Interactive Translation Systemstr4 Fully Automatic Translation Systemstr5 Multilingual Translation Systemstr6 Integration of Information and TranslationSystemsrel Iterative Index and/or Query Modificationby Enrichment of Term Relationsre2 Natural Language Front-End to Database Systemsre3 Graphic Displsy for Query Formulation supportre4 Multi-Lingual Databases and Search Assistancere5 Public Information Systemsqul Integration of Reference Retrieval andQuestion Answering Systemsqu2 Linguistic Modeling of Question/AnswerInteractionqu3 Formal Dialogue Behaviorqu4 Belief Structuresqu5 Heuristic/Common Sense Knowledgequ6 Change of Roles in Man-Machine Communicationqu7 Automatic Analysis of Phatic Expressionsqu8 Inferencingqu9 Variable Depth of System Answersqu10 Natural Language Answer GenerationEach topic was defined by textual paraphrase,e.g.
for ab4: "procedures of text condensationthat stress the overall, true-to-scale compressionof a given text; although varyin~ in length(according to the degree of reduction); can be usedas a substitute for original texts".3.
Answer parameters for the sub-areas3.1 Competence (--CO)At the beginning of every sub-area participantswere requested to rate their competence accord-ing to three parameters "good" (with aspeciaiist's knowledge), "fair" (with aworking knowledge), and "superficial" (with alayman's knowledge).

Information linguistics is not judged -accordir~ to the estimation of the experts - as asocially harmful scientific discipline.4.

I Sub-areas5.1.1 CompetenceCompetence was an important influence on evalua-tion.
In general one can say that peoplewith "good" competence (or more correctly: withcompetence estimation of "good") in a sub-areagave topics higher ratings for importance andfeasibility both from the research and theapplication points of view.
Nevertheless, therewere differences.
Those with "good" competencediffered more widely in evaluations ofresearch-oriented topics than in applica-tion-oriented topics, whereas those with "super-ficial" competence in the sub-areas were closer tothe average in their evaluations of applica-tion-oriented topics than of research-orientedtopics.
Here are some examples of the differences(as reflected in the averages of the sub-areas).Tab.
11 is to be read as follows: (line I) in thesub-area "Acoustic" those with "good" competenceevaluated 5.6% higher than the average with respectto importance for research, whereas people with"superficial" competence in the same sub-areaevaluated 6.9% lower than average.Tab.11 Competence differences( g=good; s=superficial)I/R I/A F/R F/ACO/g CO/s CO/g CO/s CO/g CO/s CO/g CO/sAc5.6+ 3.0- In4.7+ 5.1- Ac25.1+ 3.9- Ac9.4+ 0.6-Hal .8+ 9.3- Ab4.3+ 13.8- Sel .I- 5.8+ Ha7.5+ 7.0-In5.4+ 19.8- In6.2+ 19.4- In5.0+ 19.4-Ab7.2+ 8.4-As can be seen in the column F/R, sometimes thegeneral trend is reversed (Semantic: values from"competent" participants are lower than from par-ticipants with "superficial" competence).5.1.2 DesirabilityThere is also a connection between desirability andthe values of importance and feasibility.
Those whogave high ratin~s for desirability (DE++) ingeneral gave higher values to the single topics inthe respective sub-areas, both in comparison tothe average values and to the values of those whogave only high desirability (DE+) to a givensub-area.
The differences between DE++ and DE+ areeven higher than those between C/g und C/s.
0nlythe F/R data in the translation and retrieval areasare lower for D++ than for D+, in all other casesthe D++ values are higher.

13 and 14 should notbe over-interpreted.
In particular, ranking isunjustified.
One cannot simply conclude that,say, the sub-area "Semantics" (92.6) is moreimportant than that of "Abstracting" (75.6) withrespect to research because the average valueis higher; or that Indexing (79.2) is morefeasible from an application point of viewthan Abstracting (52.3).
$uch conclusions may betrue, and this is why the values in Tab.
13 and14 are given, but the parameters should actuallyonly be applied to the single topics in thesub-areas.
Cross-group ranking is not allowedfor methodological reasons.But nevertheless theIt is obvious thatgeneral true:data are interesting enough.the following relation is inI/R (-values) > I/A > F/R > F/AThere are some exceptions to this general rule,such as Re-I/A>I/R (both in Set A and Set C);Ha-F/R>I/R (in Set C); (Re-F/R ant F/A)>I/R--(inSet_C); and I1-F/R>~/R(both in Set_A and SetC).There seems to be a non-trivial g~p between impor-tance and feasibility (both with respect toresearch and application).
In other words, thereare more problems than solutions.
And there is aneven broader gap between application and research.From a practical point of view there is some skep-sis concerning the possibility of solving importantresearch problems.
And what seems to be feasiblefrom a research point of view looks different froman application one.The values in the second round are in generalhigher than in the first one.
This is an argumentagainst the oft cited Delphi hypothesis that thefeedback-mechanism - i.e.
that the data of theprevious round are made known at the start of thefollowing round -has an averaging effect.
Theincrease-effect can probably be explained by thefact that the percentage of qualified and "com-p etent" people was higher in the second round perhaps these were the ones who were motivated totake on the burden of a second round) - and, asTab.11 shows, people who rated themselves "com-petent" tend to evaluate higher.Between the two rounds the decline in thesub-areas "Software" and "Hardware" (apart from theparameter F/R) is striking.
There is an overallincrease for '%lorphology" and "Information Lan-guages" for all parameters, and a dramatic increasefor the topics in "Indexing" for F/R (9.7%), and adramatic decline for the "Translation"- and "Ques-tion-Answering"-topics for the parameter F/A (9.8and 8.4%).The dates of realization do not change dramati-cally?
On the average there is a difference of oneyear (and this makes sense because there was almostone year between round I and 2).
There is a ten-dency from a research point of view for the expec-tation of realization to be somewhat earlier froman application standpoint.
But the differences arenot so dramatic as to justify the conclusion thatresearchers are more optimistic thandevelopers/practitioners.5.2 Single topicsTab.
15 and 16 show the two highest rated topics ineach sub-area in the first two columns and the twolowest rated topics in each sub-area in the lasttwo columns.
These represent average data fromSet C. The four columns in the middle show theestimation of participants who work in research orapplication, respectively.
As part of the demos-copic data it was determined whether participantswork more in research or in application (cf.Tab.6).
Notice that both groups answered from aresearch and application point of view.
In a moredetailed analysis (which will be published later)this-  and other aspects- can be pursued.

It was an extremelytime-consuming task to answer the questionnaire,which was more like a book than a folder.
I hopethe results justify the efforts.
The analysis wouldnot have been possible without the help of m~colleagues - Udo Hahn for the conceptual desi~a,and Dr.J.Staud together with Annette Woehrle, FrankDittmar and Gerhard Schneider for the statisticalanalysis.
