HOW TO MISREAD A D ICT IONARYGeorge A. Mi l lerDepar tment  of PsychologyPr inceton UniversityPr inceton,  N J  08544A dictionary is an extremely valuable reference book, but itsfamiliarity tends to blind adults to the high level of intelligencerequired to read it.
This aspect becomes apparent, however,when school children are observed learning dictionary skills.Children do not respect syntactic ategory and often wanderinto the wrong lexieai entry, apparently in search of somethingthey can understand.
They also find it difficult to match thesense of a polysemous word to the context of a particularpassage.
And they repeatedly assume that some familiar wordin a definition can be substituted for the unfamiliar word itdefines.The lexical information that children need can be providedbetter by a computer than by a book, but that remedy will notbe realized if automated dictionaries are merely machine-readable versions of the standard printed dictionaries.
