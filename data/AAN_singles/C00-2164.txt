Perception, Concepts and Language: 7~oA~9 and IPaGeMatth ias  Rehm and Kar l  Ul r i ch  GoeckeFacu l ty  of  L ingu is t ics  and  L i te ra tureUn ivers i ty  of Bielef('ld{rehm,  goecke} @col i .u i f i -b ie lefe ld.deAbstractA two-level natural language generation system tbrsituation and action descriptions (SADs) of a sinm-lated assembly robot is presented, in the first step,multimodal inibrmation is used to obtain a concep-tual representation (CR) of an event.
The secondstep is the lmrallel, incremental surface realizatiou ofutterances from the robot's t)erspecl;ive bascxl on theCR.
Theoretical issues addressed are semantics ofSAI)s and distribution of lexical and syntactic pro-cessing, leading to a natural type of in(:rementalityin NLG.1 I n t roduct ionFollowing (Reiter, 1.994), in the ma,jority of systemslanguage generation starts with content determina-tion.
This step is fllrther subdivided in deep con-tent dcl.cr'm, inatio,n where a decision takes i)lat-e whatinfornmtion shouhl 1)e (:ommmficated to the lmareJ'mM 7q,,eto'rical p anning where this ilfl'ormation is or-galfized in a rhetorically coher(mt rammer.
However,the definition of deet) content deternfination allowstwo difl'ering interpretations: One perspective is thatthere already exists a set of representations of dif-ferent contents in a specific representation tbrmat.The task is to select one of these representations tobe commmficated.
This process is tyl)icalty imple-mented using discourse structure information andother criteria (e.g.
Grice's maximes, (Grice, 1975)).Tim or, her t)erspective is more extensive.
If, ini-tially, no set; of rcpresentations i  available, deepcontent deternfination could also comprise the cre-ation of this set.
In many technical apt)lications,this viewpoint does not really make sense.
In themost widesl)read case - language generation out of~ data base - the systein is the set of representa-tions.
A possibly more complex case - language gen-eration by agents 1 - seems to be no problem either:Take tile world model and tile lflan representing theagent's environment and fl~ture actions, respectivelyand then select fi'om these representations the con-tent to be verbalized.
Approaches of this kind are1For a discussion of this notion see e.g.
(Franklin mid(\] raessc.r, t996).indeed al)plied in various cene description or roboticsystems, e.g.
(Now~k, 1987), (Lfingle et al, 1995).Itowever, there are agent architectures not enter-tahfing a coherent world inodel and not having anexplicit plan at ('.very level of action available.
Suchagent architectures have emerged within behavior-oriented robotics over the past fifteen years (e.g.
(Brooks, 1986)).
Percet)tion and control 1)rocessesare distributed over many inodules and interacl; 012a local rather than a global basis.
Thus, reactivel~ehavior is modeled.Considering the problem of language generation ,it becomes more natural to adopt the second t)er-spective about what deep content determinationshould mean ill this context.
In this paper, wepresent an aI)proach to natural hmguage generationwhere in a first step, a set of possible utterancesof an agent is constructed 1) 3, the system "R.oADl~)r the lack of a better term, we call l;his pro-eess concCl)tualizatio,n.
The intermediate struclurc,is based on the Conceptual Semantics paradigm (e.g.
(Jackendoff, 1.990)).
In a second stel) , what is clas-sically thought of as language generation is accom-plished with the system IPaGe (Increnmntal ParallelGenerator).
Here we propose a nmssively parallelapproach that leads to a natural kind of either quali-tative and quantitative incrementality (c.f.
(Flakier,1997)).The l)at)er is structured as follows: In section 2,some theoretical claims are clarified and the imple-mentation of ~,oJl'D is illustrated with an exampleconceptualization.
The corresponding CR is alsoused in section 3 where IPaGe is described.
An out-look on directions for further research ill section 4concludes this paper.2 Conceptua l i za t ionThe example domain of our work is the artificialagent CoT~,el (c.f.
(Milde et al, 1997)).
It is a sin>ulated assembly robot, al)le to manipulate woodentoy parts and instructable by a human user.
Due toits behavior-l)ased control architecture, not every in-structed action is carried out as expected.
Thus, anexplanation of ongoing actions by the robot is desir-1091able.
We shall deal with a specific kind of utterances,namely situation/action descriptions (SADs).SADs are descriptions of the enviromnent andthe actions of an agent from its own perspective.In the chosen domain, possible SADs are: Ichbewege mich zu dem blauen Wiirfel (I am mov-ing towards the bhm cube) or Ich lege den Wiirfelauf e ine Le is te  (I am placing a cube on a connec-tion bar).A theoretical and an application-oriented issue areaddressed with the investigation of SADs: First, weclaim that internal and sensoric parameters of theagent play a decisive role in deternfining the seman-tics of SADs, especially of action verbs.
Second, bygenerating SADs, we enable an interactor to under-stand what the agent is doing.
This is particularlyinteresting if there is no direct visual contact be-tween the agent and the interlocutor.Sensor data (visual, telemetric, haptic) and inter-nal states (activation of behavior generating modules(BM), joint values) of Co7?A set've as selection crite-ria (SC) of interpretative schemata (ISM) contain-ing also conceptual units (Goeeke and Milde, 1998).These units constitute the interface to tile surfacegeneration process.
If the SC are present in the cur-rent sensoric pattern of the robot, an ISM may be-come active and the corresponding concept informa-tion is passed to surface generation (c.f.
section 3).Some SC are temporally extended: A sensor valuehas to be in some interval for a certain amount oftime to function as a trigger for an ISM.Additional to sensor data and internal values, ISMthemselves can be part of the SC of other ISM.
Thelatter ones are then said to have a higher degreeof complexity then the former ones.
ISM may besubsumed by other ISM or may bear a part/whole-relation to other ISM.
An ISM is subsumed by an-other one if its SC constitute a proper subset ofthe SC of the subsuming ISM, including time re-strictions.
For example, the ISM MOVE, detecting amovement of the robot that is not specified with re-spect to direction or velocity, is subsumed by MOVE-TO-OBJECT which, in addition, recognizes a goal ofthe movement, namely some object.
Part/whole-relations of ISM exist if a "higher" ISM combinesothers to identify more complex actions.
In this case,the "lower" ISM not necessarily has to be active overthe whole time interval that the higher one covers.Thus, ISM form a hierarchy (see fig.
1).
ISM onthe lowest level (St.;E, MOVE, BUMI', ...) are basic inthe sense that they only contain sensor data as SC.Complex ISM in levels 1 to 4 integrate sensor dataas well as other ISM.When an ISM becomes active, the correspondingconceptual representation (CR) is a possible candi-date to be passed to the surfime generation compo-nent.
As it is possible that several ISM are active.

.Figure 1: Screen depiction of the ISM-hierarchy.
Ac-tive ISM are coloured; edges mark subsumption orpart/whole-relations.at the same time, a selection has to take place.
Atpresent, the only criterium relevant for selection isthe position of the corresponding ISM within the hi-erarchy.
Thus, only the CR of the highest activeISM is going to be verbalized at the given time.CRs contain information about objects, theirproperties attd about events tile agent is involvedin.
They follow the Conceptual Semantics by ,Jack-endoff (Jackendoff, 1990).
In the next section, anexample shows the representations u ed in goADin more detail.2.1 ExampleIn the following, the conceptualization of tileSAD Ich drehe mich zu dem blauen Wiirfel (Iam turning to the bhm cube) is going to illustratethe processing mechanisms described in the previoussection.Suppose a situation where visual and movementinformation is provided by the sensors of tile robot.Among other things, the ISM SEIC checks for the ex-istance of values in the interface for either objecttype (type), object color (color)  or object positionwithin the visual field (x-g und y-g).
A possibleconfiguration istype:  c co lor :  bx-g:  102 y-g:  99width: 83 he ight :  200The SC of SEE is a disjunction of several con-ditions.
If any of these conditions is met, tileISM becomes active: x-g > 0 \[ y-g > 0 \[ width1092> 0 \[ he ight  > 0.
The  ('Oml)arison between theattribute-value pairs in the interface and the SC ofSl,',I," shows that solne relevant paranmters are indee(1present.
Thus, SEE t)ecomes active.The understmcified CR of SEE is EVENT: see,AGENT: ?, OBJECT: 0BJ, (COLOR: COL).
EVENTand AGENT arc instantiated with default vahms.
Tileassociated transition rules sl)ecit\[y the remainingconceptual parameters:type OBJ ---+ OBJcolor COL - -+ COLConsequently, the comt)lete CI1, of sI.
:g is EVENT:see ,  AGENT: i ,  OBJECT: c ,  COLOR: b 2On the basis of the sensor data down: -8 andve loc i ty :  0.441355, denoting a downward move-inent with a certain velocity, the ISM MOVF becomesactive at the same time.The basic ISM SEE and MOVE serve as SC for theCOlnplex ISM TUI{N-TO which identifies the turningof the robot towards an object;.
Furthermore, TURN-q'O has some additional SC.
The complete set ix asfollows:MOVE ~ SEE((cont 100) x-g) (,:,,,it lOO) y-g)) fo,.scyclesThus, if MOVE an(1 SEE are active tbr five cyclesand, in addition, the object in the visual tMd is mov-ing to the center of vision, 'I'\[JI/.N-'I'O is activated.MOVE and SEE make available their CRs to TUI/N-TO.
By this nmans, 1)reviously unst)e(:ificd t)arame-ters in 't 'UII,N-TO's Cl~, c&n })e spell(~d out via the.transition rulesee(OBa, COL) ~ OBJECT,  C()L()1\].resulting in the flflly instantiated CR EVENT: turn,AGENT: ?, PATH: to ,  OBJECT: c, COLOR: b.If TUI/N-TO turns out to be the highest active ISMat; a given time, it is selected for surface generation.3 Generat ing  the  u t te ranceAfter conceptualizing the agent's current action atthe level of ISMs (content determination) it has tobe decided how the corresl)onding CR can be artic-ulated in a natural language utterance.
A fimda-mental division in lexieal and syntactical processingalong with an incremental and parallel processingbehaviour are the crucial features of tile proposedarchitecture for surface realization.
Such a process-ing behaviour ix facilitated by the use of CRs as in-terface between "R.oAD and iPaGe.2c stands for the concel~tual entity 'cube', b for 'l)hm'."

All processescan obtain this information if needed.3.1 Blackboard architectureThe blackl)oard is the central storing device of tilesystem.
All processes write their results on tileblackboard and obtain their input structures there.In such an architecture parallel processing can beachieved in a convenient fashion.3.2 Parallel processingParallel processing can be found on various levels ofabstraction.
The flmdmnental division runs 1)etweenlexical and syntactical 1)rocessing (see fig.
2).
Whena (1)art of a) CR originating from tile ISM is writtenon the blackboard, processing of this structure startssinmltaneously in both components.
Using a concep-tual lexicon as described by Jackendoff a transfor-nlation process constitutes the first si:e l) on the lexi-eal side (Jackendoff, 1990).
On the syntactical side,a 1)locess based on the type-phrase-corresl)ondence,also described by Jackendoff, starts processing inthis component.
The type-t)hrase-correst)ondenceconstrains the choice of possible phrases to realizea structure with a given conceptual type in an ut-terance.Different processes inside these two componentswork sinmltaneously on different CRs.
On the lexiealside, the three subprocesses transformation, choos-ing of lexeme and morphological processing can beidentified.
On the syntactical side the real)ping ofconceptual types on possible phrase structure rulesand the instantiation of these rules take place.3.3 Incremental  processingIn natural anguage generation, incremental process-ing is a central issue.
According to Finkler's defini-tion two fundamental types can be identified: quan-titative and qualitative incremental processing (\]?in-kier, 1997).Quantitative incremental processing nmans thatthe inlmt to a process can be divided into differ-1093\]EVENT turn (\[AGENT\] 52' \[PATH\]\]AGENT i15229 )\] 7\[PATH to (\[OB.I~CT\])\] 29IOB JECT cube-~COiOR\] J 29\[COLOR blue\] 29Figure 3: A complex CR with its subparts whichcan serve as inlmt increments to the generation pro-tess.
Parts of the same structure are coindexed.

Thus, \[PATH to(\[0BJECT\]) \ ]  is a possibleincrement.ent parts and that processing of these parts is possi-ble.
Qualitative incremental processing ou the otherhand denotes the possibility to ()btain a first, subop-timal result and to elaborate it wtmn new ilfforma-lion is available.IPaGe realizes both kinds of incremental process-ing.
Parts of CRs correspond to possil)le phrasestructures that constitute the utterance, i.e.
type-ptlrase-corresl)ondence.
Thus quantitative incre-inental processing can be achieved ill a natural way.An arbitrarily complex part of a CR can serve as anincrement.Qualitative increnlental processing is accom-plished on tile level of instantiating phrase structurerules.
A pllrase Call always be realized by severalrules of differing colnplexity.
D)r exalnple, a nounphrase call be realized ill one of tile following wws:as a noun, as a determiner and a noun, as an ad-jective and a noun, etc.
All rules for a given CRm:e started as independent processes trying to ii1-stantiate ttmir right hand sides.
The result of a suc-cessful process is written on the blackboard and allprocesses with equal or less complexity are stopped.Processes of higher complexity can try fllrther to in-stantiate their phrase strnctnre rules.
Ill case Olm ofthese processes ucceeds, the former result is over-written by the more colnplex one.
Depending onthe utterance tilne of tile given phrase a more orless complex result is achieved.3.4 ExampleThe exmnple introduced in section 2.1 is continuedhere.
Outlmt of the ISM and thus input to tilegeneration process is tlm CR dei)icted in figln'e 3.This structure will be realized in an utterance likeIch drehe reich zu dem Wiirfel (I anl turning totlm cube)bzw.
Zu dem blauen Quader drehe ichreich (To the blue cuboid I am turning).
Tlm gener-ation process is exemplified by the processing of thePATH-structure.3.4 .1  Trans format ionEvery CR carries enough information to initiate dif-ferent processes inlultaneously.
At the moinent allinput structure is supplied, it triggers processing in-side the lexical and tile syntactical comt)onent: tiletransformation and the mapping process.As CRs describe meaning by a structural mech-alfism, the same head can have different ineaningsill different structural constellations.
~iS'anst'orina-lion - a disanlbiguation process - is imt)lemented asa lookup process in a conceptual lexicon.
The en-tries in tiffs lexicon are sorted by different keys.
Thefirst key is the type of the CR.
Int)ut incrementsto tile lexical processing component are typed CI/,s.Thus a type specific distribution of processing seelnsnatural here.By the PATH-stnmture tim PATH-specific trans-formation process is triggered.
The lookup pro-cess will yield a so-called intermediate structurealready with some syntactic intbrmation such ascategory infornlation: \[PRED "co, CAT prep,  ARG29\]29.
\[OBJECT cube\] will yield: \[PRED b lock ,CAT n\] 29.3 .4 .2  MappingPATH- all(\] 0BJECT-structure initiate tlm mal)-t)ing process simultaneously to the transfiwma-lion i)rocess.
During mal)t)ing the tyl)e-1)hrase-correspondence as described by (Jackendotl', 1990)is used.
A given tyl)e can be expressed in an utter-ante only by a restricted set of possible phrases.
Anml)t)ing of the types of the int)ut structures to therelevant 1)hrase structure rides takes place.
Tlleserules are then started as independent threads.In Gerlnan, structures with type PATH are nearlyalways realized as prepositioiml pllrases.
The PATH-specific mapl)ing process will tlms start PP-rlfles,e.g.
PP29 -+ PREP  NP  or PP29 -+ PREP  ADV.
Tile0BJECT-st ructure  will trigger the 0BJECT-sl)ecificmat)ping ttlrea(1 which will start NP-rules, e.g.
NP2:)-+ N, NP29 -4 DET N, orNP29 ~ DET ADJ N.3 .4 .3  I ns tant ia t ionAll threads tarted during the mapping process con-stitute the instantiation module.
These threads co>respond to phrase structure rules and try to substi-tute the right hand side non-ternfinals with inflectedwords.
If one rule is fillfilled, the result will be writ-ten on the blackboard.
All rules for the same con-stituent which m:e more colnplex will continue pro-cessing.
If such a more complex rifle is flflfille(1, it;will overwrite the result on the blackboard by a inore1094eomt)lex, i.e.
more elaborate one.
