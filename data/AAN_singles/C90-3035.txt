J. Wat~n Research CenterYorktown Heights, NY 10598AMR @ IBM.COM WLODZ @ IBM.COMAbstractWe propose formalisms and conceptswhich allow to make precise them'gmnents in controversies over theadequacy of competing models oflanguage, and over their formalequivalence.1.
IntroductionIt is customary to judge the success of scientificmodels by their agreement or otherwise with theobserved data.
For example, linguists require ofgrammm's that they generate the tight sentences,but also that they correctly classify the sentencesand phi'ases as to the categories and constructionsthey belong to.
Our purpose is provide a formalaccount of the elusive concept of expressive powerwith respect to the kinds of categories andconstructions that a grammar (of a given type) canreflect.
The principal concept will be definabilityof relations in a logical formalism corresponding toa given grarmnar type in this language, specificallydefinability without the use of disjunction in thedefining tbrmula.
Our results can be summar~edas follows:1.
We cast CFGs in a logical formalism.
Wethen progressively enrich the formalism toexpress the parametrization of categories andof constructions in various ways as well as byallowing metarules and transformations.2.
We then prove a number of theorems aboutwhat can and cannot be done in a givenformalism, focusing on the definability ofcategories and constructions (both taken asrelations in the logic).a.
Definability is characterized precisely forthe first time, and we distinguish variouskinds, of which nondisjunctive definabilitycorresponds closely the notion ofcapturing a linguistic generalization in agrammar.b.
Agreement is not definable in CFtheories, but can be defined intheories/grammars with attributes.c.
Constructions whose variants differ inword order and/or in the number ofconstituents cannot be captured even byCFGs with attributes, but can in slightly'more powerful models.d.
Constructions as above but where theorder and/or the number of constituentscorrelate ('agree') with some other t~aturerequire inherently more powerful systems.We show how such patterns can becaptured if we parametrize concatenationand the number of constituents (for thefirst time, something other than categoriesgets parametrized).e.
The same generalizations can be capturedvia transformations or metarules.Cn'ammars with transformations andmetarules can be treated as particularcases of a certain formal proof system.f.
Various extended notions of definabilityare considered; for example, the binaryrelation between pairs of trees related by ametarule or transformation, and thenotion of definability across a class ofgrammars.2.
Definability2.1 Expressive powerThe expressive power of a logical theory dependson four factors:1.
The formal language L in which the theory iswritten;Example: FOL (the First Order Ix~c) ismore expressive than the PropositionalCalculus195I2.
The class of WFF of well-formed formulas ofI4Example: FOL is more expressive than HornClauses, but the latter are easily computable(no function symbols in both cases).3.
Axioms of the theory;Example.
Two theories expressed in thesame language, such as L = (+ ,*,=, < ,1), canhave completely different properties.
Forinstance the axiomatization of real numbers inL gives a decidable theory, and hence anyformula written in L is either provable ordisprovable from the axioms, But theaxiomatization of natural numbers in the samelanguage does not decide all formulas, i.e.there are formulas written in L which cannotbe proved or disproved from the axioms.4.
Rules of inference;Example.
With Modus Ponens A, A---,B // Bone can prove more than just with the ruleA I/ AvB.We shall deal mostly with 1,2 and 4, and allow 3to correspond to a translation into a logicallanguage of the context free part of a grammar.
Aswe have already mentioned, the difference betweenTGs and MGs has something to do with 4.2.2 Context  Free Theor iesUsing granamars we can talk about which notionscml be defined, or expressed, thereby only in anintuitive sense.
The reason for that lies in the factthat '%eing defined/definable" is a property of apredicate, therefore a proper language for studyingexpressive power of different grammars, andgrammatical formalisms is logic.
Then we can talkabout non-defibility or definability of notions suchas Passive(x) or Passive of(x,y) formally, in alogical system.
It turns out that definability of sucha concept depends on a formal language in which agrammar is written.
Thus it may happen that twogrammars prove "sentencehood" of the exactly thesame classes of strings, but it is possible to definesuch a predicate in one of those theories and not inthe other.We begin with CFGs.
Since we are going to beconcerned with definability, we first translate CFGsinto CFTs (Context Free Theories).
Thetranslation works as follows.
A CF production likeH -~ &B2 ... 11, goes intoH(xt.x2 .

.
x,) ~ B,(xO&&(x~ )& ... &B,(x,) (notethat all the variables are different); H ~ a.Gand H --* a.b are replaced by tl(a.x) ~ G(x)and H ( a. b ) , respectively.For the sake of the uniformity of notation we willrepresent a rule of the form H,--B~&B= as\[H, \[Bi, B=\]\].
(The the rule of substitution willcorrespond to the resolution).Propositiontranslation.proves S(s).I.
Let G be a CFG and G' itsA string s belongs to L(G) iff G'2.3 The Undefinability of AgreementWe turn to a simple example, namely, agreementbetween NPs and VPs.
Consider a sample CFT:S(x.y) <- NP_sing_fem(x) & VP sing_fem(y).S(x.y) <- NP_sing mat(x) & VP sing_mat(y).S(x.y) <- NP sing_neu(x) & VP sing_neu(y).S(x.y) <- NP_plur_fern(x) & VP plur_fem(y).S(x.y) <- NP plur_mal(x) & VP plur_mal(y).S(x.y) <- NP_plurneu(x) & VP plurneu(y).In order to prove that agreement cannot becaptured here, we need to specify what that wouldmean.
It is easy to show that well-defined relationssuch as numberagree(number,x,y) oragree(number, x,y) are only definable in CFT if thedefining formula.uses disjunction.
But traditionallydisjunction in grammatical description is a standardnotation for two (or more) unrelated phenomena.Thus, disjunction is not forbidden, but when itoccurs, it impfies the factual claim about thereferents of the disjuncts are distinct linguisticphenomena.
In the case before us, that would besaying that singular and plural agreement are notthe same phenomenon.
It is not, of course, thebusiness of logic to inquire into whether in factnumber agreement in some language is a unitaryphenomenon.
It is rather the business of' logic toprovide the tools for the linguist scientist who, onwhatever basis, makes such determinations, tocapture formally the theories that he develops,Accordingly, we first assume a special notion ofdefinability, defined as follows:Definition.
A relation p is &-definable in a CFTtheory T if there is a formula(*) / ' (x , ,  ... ,x,,) ,-- & ... & &.B(x,  x i .
.
.
.  )
& ...196 2s.t.
the tuples (a, .... , a~), which can be proven fromT+ (*) to satisfy P(...), are exactly those belongingto the relation p.A category c is &-definable in a CFT theory T ifthe one argument relation corresponing to c is.ltowever, some categories ttms defined are spuriousin that they cannot be used in provingsentencehood.
We want to rule these out.I.et Lnf(G) be the language that contains onlythose categories which appear in the formulas\[S,\[...\]\] which are derivable in.
(the CFTcon'esponding to) the grammar.
From now on, by(&-)definability we shall understated the(&-)definability in L~G) .
Moreover, the notionof 'category' will be analogously restricted.
Tiffsallows us to avoid spurious categories as in 2.4below.We wil!
also refer to constructions which areI.wo~place relations between a grammatical category(the category the construction yields) and a string,ff grmnmatical categories (which the constructioni:; made up of).2.4 Spurious categories(;onsider a g)-amrnar like:S o > NPsg VPsg~;-> NPplVPplNPs -> Det NsNPp-> Det NpNP - > Det Nins - > dog, cat ....Np - > dogs, cats ....N - > dog, dogs, cat, cats ....It is possible to introduce a symbol thatcorresponds to the category NP, but it c,'mnot beused in deriving sentences from the stm't symbol.Our definition allows such spurious categorysymbols to appear in formulas of CFT, but at thesame time it prevents them from having ~lyiHtluence on what categories are definable in theformalism.
This simple example clearly shows thatan appeal to intuitions would be insufficent o talkabout expressive power of the two grammars.2.5 Some ResultsTheorem 2.

Then the relationagreement agree(aq,x,y) is not &-definable.areofPropos i t ion  3.
The relation agree(number,x,y) is not&-definable in the above CFT.Theorem 3.
The category NP is not &-definable ordefinable tbr this language in CFT.Notice that linguists often do allow categories uchas NP, but not constructions (such as thesubject-predicate construction or passive) orfeatures of constructions ( uch as agreement) o bedescribed disjunctively.
This is especially true oflexical categories.
It is thus instructive that, asshown, the phenomenon of agreement means thatcertain categories are not definable at all, even withdisjunction.3.
Attributes and ConstructionsWe will talk now about a logic corresponding toCFGs with attributes.
We will show that suchlogics provide an inherently more expressive theoryof categories, ahd in particular allow us to definethe category NP  and VP in a language withnumber or gender agreement.However, the use of attributes does not lead to anall-powerful theory of constructions, ,andconsequently certain linguistic generalizations aremissed by grammars with attributes.
This leads tothe introduction of more powerful devices.
All theformal languages we consider, if not first order, canbe formalized as weak second order system in anobvious way.3.1 Word Order and Selection VariationAttribute theories clearly cannot treat as a singleconstruction two forms with different word order.That is, they cannot &-define a relation R(Cat,x),where Cat is some grammatical category and xranges over a set of strings of categories identicalexcept with respect o word order.
This defect canbe remedied by allowing an ID/LI'  tbrmat forrules, which we formalize in a very similar way.
(Details omitted.)
Iiowever, this formalism if thevariants with different orders do not differ in anyother way.
What is more interesting is whathappens with ex;unples in which the choice of3 ~\[97attributes for some element is correlated with achoice of word order.
For example, English has aslightly different class of verbs in "inverted"sentences than others, e.g.
Aren't I smart?
vs. *Iaren't smart.
There is no way to connectV \] with the V< NP order, as opposed to + #wertV - invert\] and the NP < V order.
It was precisely lto handle cases like this that metarules wereintroduced in GPSG model of grammar, and it isone of the reasons for transformations a well.By parmnetrizing word order, we can capture theword order phenomena like those in Englishinverted sentences.
Thus, we could have a grammarwith a parametrized concatenation operator conewith values, such that 0 eonc(a,b,c)--_ abc, whereas1 conc(a,b,c) =bac, for example.
We can now statea single rule of the formconc(NP,..\[ AnvUX\], VP) ....... jto handle the subject-aux inversion facts.requires a formal language with something like theKleene star, and require more space than we havein this paper.
The idea is roughly this: We haveintroduced a set of sublanguages of Lnf(G) to avoidspurious categories.
Now, we make one morerestriction: let LnJ(NP) be the language thatcontains only those categories except NP whichappear in the RHS of the formulas \[NP, \[ RIfS \]\]wtfich are derivable in (the CFT corresponding to)the grammar.
Similarly, for othercategories/symbols.
The (&-)definability of aconstruction X are defined as for other relations,except that the defining formula must belong toZ.n/(ag.Theorem 4.
Constructions with two variants whichdiffer by the order or number of constituents arenot &-definable in attribute grammars.Theorem 5.
Constructions with two variants whichdiffer by the order or number of constituentstogether with a difference in some other elementare not &-definable in attribute grammars withID/LP and parentheses.Attribute theories also cannot handle variation inselection, i.e., the arity of a construction.
This iseasily remedied by formalizing the parenthesisnotation of BNF which is often used to abbreviateCFG's--when we write, itfformally, a rule likeA-,B((~, for example.
It is harder, to handle thecorrelation between some attribute of one elementand the presence or absence of some other element.For instance, many analyses of English postulateseparate constructions of the VP depending on theclass of the verb, e.g., transitive (V NP),ditransitive (V NP NP), transitive- prepositional (VNP PP), and so on.
It has also been observed thateach of these corresponds to a passive form inwhich one NP is missing (although a PP of theform by NP is optionally possible instead, this isirrelevant for our purpose).
Again, if it were justthe presence or absence of the object NP thatdistinguished the two voices, we could use theparenthesis device.
However, the form of the verbalso changes from active (e.g.
sees) to passive (e.g.is seen).
Such phenomena, which can be handledwith metarules or transformations, also cannot behandled with attribute grammars.The problem of the definability of constructions ia more complicated one.
The results below havebeen obtained for formulas of the standard firstorder language.
A correct account of recursionNow, consider an extension of attribute grammarswhich parametrizes the presence/absence ofconstituents.
Thus, we write rules like, where ontis a parameter controling 'the appearance orabsence of an element (i.e., +ont(X) means Xappears, -ont(JO that it does not),V VP-~ \[c~ active\] ~ ont(NP)Now we can &-define the different kinds oftransitive constructions, by using ont to controlwhether the object NP is realized (in the active) ornull (in the passive).Now, the use of this device allows us to &-definethe three different kinds of transitive constructions,but not the passive construction, which stillrequires disiunction (for the same reason that theactive requires disjunction).
This is exactly thesame as with metarules and transformations (as wewill see below).
The formalism provides no way ofmaking the verb class attributes (trans, ditrans,trans prep) agree with the number and kind ofconstituent to the right of the verb (NP vs. NP NPvs.
NP PP).
Some linguists don't mind this, but wewill show below how that can also be done (whatis required is a way of making the verb classattribute agree with the number and kind ofconstituent following the verb).
In order to&-define passive, we would need a more powerful198 4kind of' parameter, which can control the numberand kind of constituents, which we call selVP-~ X selAnd combining the two (ont and sel), we candescribe both the transitive and the passive by arule like:I \] VP -~ NP.X sel.
y ont(NP) X \[ y vo,ceHowever, historically such devices as cone, ont, andsel have been unavailable, and instead,transformations and metarules have been used toobtain essentially the same effect, llence, weproceed to show how the power of these modelscan be represented4.
Derivability, WGs and M-grammars\[S(x.y), \[NP(x), VP(y)\]\]\[NP(u.w), \[ADJ(u), NP(w)\]\]\[S(u.w.y), \[\[NP(u.w), \[ADJ(u), NP(w)\]\], VP(y)\]\].Clearly, with this rule we can prove about astring that it is an S if it is generated by thecorresponding context free grammar.
In anatural way we can extend this definition of aninference rule to cover attribute grammars:attributes can be treated simply as constraints.A metarule in an M-grammar such asVP -- > X NP/ /VP \ [ I 'AS \ ]  --> X (PP)which relates passive and active, can betreated as an inference rule.\[VP(xy), \[X(x), NPO')\]\]\[VP(x.z)(PAs), IX(x), m,(t,y.z)\]\]A transformation i a TG can be understoodexactly the s,-une way, as a rule Treel//7'ree2.We will consider very simple kinds of TGs andMGs, which operate on (sub)trees of depth one.This is enough to capture GPSG use of metarules,but not the fifll power of conventional TG.
Themore general model will be discussed briefly, butfor our purposes it is more convenient sometimesto consider special cases, which make thedemonstrations simpler.The TGs and gr,'unmars with metarules (M-Gs)deal not only with strings but a!so with trees.
Tocompare them we have to use a commonformalism.
Let q" be a collection of trees (oversome alphabet with terminals, non-terminals, andperhaps other symbols), where each tree is a pair\[Node, Sons\], where Sore is a list of trees.
"Iqaeneach rule of a context free grammar can berepreserrted as a tree of depth one (the definition ofdepth being obvious), e.g.\[S(x.y), \[NP(x), VP(v)\]\], or \[N(dog), \[(p\]\].We need now to establish the followinginterpretation:?
Trees, as defined above, will be intepreted asformulas;?
The rules of proof will be expressed in theGentzen style: Tree l ,Tree2//Tree3 ;?
One of the rules of proof will be substitution,as illThe difference between TG and grammars withmetarules (M-Gs) can be now expressed in thedefinition of a proof.?

PI is a collection of formulas of depthone;2.
Q -- formulas/trees obtained by applyingmetarules;3.
P -- formulas/trees obtained by applyingthe rule of substitution.These definitions allow us to show that a variety ofconstructions not allowable by CFG's or attributegrammars are definable by MG's and TG's.
Also,we obtain a rather neat characterization of' thesimilarities and differences between TG's ,andMG's.5 1995.
Other Notions of DefinabilityThe notion of &-definability of categories andconstructions i not the only one that we couldhave employed.
One alternative would be to lookat what relations are definable.
For instance, Sells(p.93) remarks that it is impossible to expressSubject-Subject- Raising as a metarule.
From ourperspective this of course still holds true, but wecan also see that one can easily define a relationSSR(t,,t2) which holds only if the first tree has beenobtained by subject raising from the ~econd tree:SSR( t l ,  t2) , -t I = \[S(seem.y.z) ,  \[seem, NP~) ,  VP(z)\]\]& t 2 = \[Sly.seems.z) ,  \ [NP(y) ,  seems, VP(z)\]\]("seem" stands for all verbs of this class).Another extension would be to considerdefinability of categories, constructions, or relationsnot for a single grammar but across an (itffmite)class of grammars.
For example, we have seen thatin a language of CFT a definition of agreement canbe given only by a disjunctive formula, but it canbe given, so long as we confine ourselves to asingle grammar.However, in linguistics there is precedent for(informal) arguments that some notion, whiledefinable for each grammar of a class, cannot bedefined for the whole class.
Ttfis idea leads to anew notion of definability:Definition.
A property Pr is definable over/acrossa class of theories C , if there is a formula F(x)s.t.
for any T in C, and any term t of the language,we have Pr(t) iff T+ F(x)  proves P(t).Similarly, one defines &-definabality across C. (Pr(t) means that it holds in any model of 7).Let's concentrate on the agreement wrt gender.Notice that the assumption that agreement existsand that it should be somehow expressible in agrammar (using disjunctions or not) is an empiricalstatement.
We could express it formally byaugmenting our language with a (higher order)device detecting the presence of a substring 'fern' ina predicate as inS(x.y)  ~ NP  - sing - fe rn (x )  & VP - sing - fe rn (y ) .We will be interested in a subclass of CFT thatallow formulas of the sort:S(x.y)  ~ NP  - at!
- a h - ...at N - fe rn(x )  &VP-  at 1 - ...at N - fem(y)Assuming that we can talk about agreementformally, we can formulate and prove the followingfact.Theorem 6.
Agreement with respect o an attributeis not definable across the class CFT of contextfree theories.We now see that much stronger results can beachieved across languages than for one language.For a single CFT, we can only that agreement isnot &-definable, but for the CFT's as a class wehave just seen that it is not defmable at all.6.
ConclusionsWe proved a' number of results about theexpressive power of a number of grammaticalformalisms, not just CFGs, but also others thatresemble more closely what linguists actually workwith.
More important, we have proposed amethod which can be  extended to any class ofgrammars for characterizing precisely whatrelations, constructions, and categories this kind ofgrammar can "capture".
In the process, we haveclarified the notion of category, defined for the firsttime the notion of construction, and proposed anumber of grammatical devices that have not beenconsidered before, and cast a new light on theproblem of the relation of metarules,transformations, and extensions of phrase structure,such as parametrizing categories (i.e., usingattributes) and parametrizing constructions.
Webelieve that the crucial step was dealing not directlywith grammars but with correspondbag logicaltheories for such grarmnars, and this will continueto prove fruitful in the future.2006
