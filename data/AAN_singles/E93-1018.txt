let.uva.nlAbstractAn assumption shared by many theories ofdiscourse is that discourse structure con-strains anaphora resolution (cf.
\[Grosz andSidner 1986\] for definite NPs, \[Lascaridesand Asher 1991\], \[Nakhimovsky 1988\]for temporal anaphora, \[Webber 1990\]for deictic pronouns and \[Gardent 1991\],\[Prfist and Scha 1990\] for VP ellipsis).
Theaim of this paper is (i) to show that this as-sumption also applies to multiple VP ellip-sis (VPE), (ii) to argue that other levels oflinguistic information (such as syntax andsemantics) interact with discourse structurein determining multiple VPE acceptabilityand (i i i)to make these intuitions preciseby providing a unification-based account ofmultiple VPE resolution.1 Introduction\[Klein and Stainton-Ellis 1989\] convincingly arguethat VPE need not resolve to the nearest possibleantecedent.
The most intricate examples they giveto support his claim involve what they dubbed mul-t iple VPE  and can be illustrated by the follow-ing discourses (square brackets urround antecedentVPs, 01 indicates VP ellipses and indices representanaphoric dependencies) 1 :*The work reported here was partially carried out inthe LRE Project 61-062, Towards a declarative theory ofdiscourse.1 Although this data often raises suspicion among lin-guistic audiences as to its credibility, the facts are that(1) it is real life data and (2) it can be understood and itis usually understood in an unambiguous fashion.
Hence(1) I promised myself I \[x wouldn't go to Manch-ester\] unless I first \[2 opened a big stack ofmail\].
I didn't 02, so I didn't 01.
(Nesting)(2) If you \[1 work hard, make the right choicesand keep your nose clean\], you \[2 get ahead\].If you don't 01, you don't 09.. (Crossing)(3) I was \[1 really thin\] then, and I tried some ski-pants that \[2 looked really good on me\], andI \[3 should have bought them\].
But I didn't03, and now I 'm not 01 and they wouldn't 0~.
(Mi~ed)As these examples how, there is not one patternrelating multiple VPEs to their antecedents, but atleast three: nesting, crossing and mixed.
Nestingand crossing can be represented as follows (whereVPi and 0i represent antecedent and elliptical VPsrespectively):Nesting: VP1 ... VP,~ 0n ... 01Crossing: VP1.. .
VPn 01...0nwhile a mixed pattern simply is a configuration inwhich both crossing and nesting occur.
Accordingto this terminology, (1) illustrates a nesting pattern,(2) shows a crossing pattern and (3) a mixed pattern.Thus, it is clear that no unique dependency config-uration constrains the resolution of multiple VPEs.On the contrary, it appears that all patterns are pos-sible and thus that any configurational restriction onVPE resolution is doomed to failure.
Interestinglyhowever, despite the multiple ways in which each ofthe VPEs could be resolved, there is in actual factno ambiguity as to how the global discourse shouldbe understood.
This suggests that some strong con-straints come into play to help the hearer resolvethe question: What is it that constrains multiple VPEresolution in such a way that these "exotic" discoursesare in fact intelligible?139adequately.
In what follows, I argue that discoursestructure (rather than surface ordering) is one of themain constraint regulating multiple VPE resolution.2 D iscourse  grammar  and  VPEreso lu t ionThe discourse grammar used buildson \[Polanyi and Scha 1984\].
More specifically, I as-sume that discourse is a tree structured entity whosewell formedness can be described by a unificationbased discourse grammar.
Under such a grammar,a discourse constituent is either a discourse relation,a clause or a discourse relation together with oneor more discourse constituent(s).
The grammar as-sociates with each constituent a complex categorywhich for the purpose of this paper, I will assumeto consist of the six main attributes PHO, CAT, SEM,IN, OUT and RESTR.
PHO, CAT, SEM unsurprisinglydenote the phonology, the category and the seman-tic representation f the constituent described by thecomplex category.
IN and OUT are attributes whichrepresent the flow of anaphoric information, that is,IN represents the in-going context (where a contextis a sequence of potential antecedents i.e.
a sequenceof VP categories) and OUT, the out-going context.Finally RESTR is short for restriction and takes asvalue a constraint which must evaluate to true forthe category to be well-formed.Conventions: In what follows I will omit any in-formation that is not relevant o the purpose of thediscussion.
In particular, I shall omit irrelevant at-tributes in categories and any anaphoric informationnot pertaining to VPE  (i.e.
anaphoric pronominal in-formation is ignored).
Furthermore, the values of ISand OUT attributes (which should be VP categories)will be abbreviated to the SEM values of these cat-egories.
Finally, I will use the term a-clause as anabbreviation for antecedent clause and e-clause, forelliptical clause.A simple example will illustrate the workings ofthe discourse grammar with respect o VPE resolu-tion.
Consider the discourse in (4).
(4) (a) Jon \[1 likes Mary\] (b) and (c) Peter does$1 too.As indicated by the bracketed letters, this dis-course includes three basic discourse constituents:the two clauses (a) and (c) and the discourse con-nective and.
Consider first the category associatedwith (a).
Ignoring irrelevant attributes, this categorycan be represented as follows2:~For expository purposes, I assume here a sentenfial(rather than a discourse) semantics.
In practice, however,the analysis is to be based on a discourse semantics andmost importantly, the definitions of structural identityand of equivalence classes over relations (see below) axeto apply to discourse semantics representations and todiscourse relations respectively.SEM like:\[j,m\] \]\] IN _OUT \[like:\[m\]\]With regard to VPE  resolution, two points are rel-evant.
First the IN value is a don't-care-value (sym-bolized here by the anonymous variable), thus sig-naling the fact that incoming anaphoric informationis irrelevant in the case of non-elliptical clauses.
Sec-ond, the OUT value contains the information asso-ciated with the sentence main VP  thus signallingthe fact that non elliptical clauses update the cur-rent outgoing context with new information.
Notethat anaphoric information concerning VPs  is hereassumed not to be cumulative, that is the OUT valueof \ [ \ ]  is not "added" to the IN value - rather it con-stitutes the sole output of (a) independent of thepreceding context.
The intuition formalised here isthat the discourse ntity providing the interpreta-tion of an elided VP is not as persistent as an indi-vidual discourse ntity and thus should remain localto the discourse constituent that introduced it (al-though in some particular cases such as e.g.
paral-lelism, anaphoric information pertaining to VPs canbe percolated by the discourse grammar ules).
Formore details on this point, the reader is referred to\[Gardent 1991\], pages 141-142.Now consider the category assigned by the dis-course grammar to the elliptical clause (c).
Againignoring irrelevant attributes, this category can berepresented as:SEM R:\[p\[ As\] \]\[E IN \[R:AS\]OUT \[R:As\]where R and As are unification variables over re-lations and arguments respectively.
The importantpoint to note here is that the variables R and As areshared by the IN value on the one hand, and by theSEM value on the other.
This in effect implementsVPE  resolution.
To see this, suppose that we have adiscourse rule of the following form (AND abbreviatesthe category for and):Seml\] \[S M Sem2\]IN In , AND , IN OutlOUT OUtl OUT Out2\[ SEM and:\[Seml,Sem2\] \]IN InOUT \[Outl, Out2\]Application of this rule to the categories of (a), (b)and (c) above will trigger the unification of Outlwith \[like:\[m\]\] on the one hand, and \[R:As\] on theother.
Thus \[R:As\] is unified with \[like:\[m\]\] and thesemantic representation R:\[p I As\] of (c) will becomelike:\[p,m\], just as required.1403 D iscourse  s t ructure  and  Mu l t ip leVPE  reso lu t ion3.1 Some dataThe claim this paper makes about multiple VPE res-olution is that the same discourse relation must holdbetween the multiple VP ellipses on the one hand andthe multiple antecedents on the other.
The presentsection has for object to substantiate this claim.
Asa first case in point, consider the following example.
(5) I never go swimming because I don't lookgood in a swimming suit.
(causal)a. I might i f I  did.
(causal)b.
If I did, I probably would.
(causal)c. Sarah does and so she does.
(causal)d. ?
I might after I did.
(temporal)e. ?
I might but I did.
(contrast)Example (5) gives a case of a-clauses which arerelated by a causal relation.
Several possible contin-uations are then given, some of them are acceptable,some of them are not.
The relevant observation isthat in those cases where the relation holding be-tween e-clauses also is a causal one, the continuationis acceptable; however, in those cases where the rela-tion holding between e-clauses i  of a different nature,the continuation is inacceptable.As a second case in point, consider example (6):(6) I was thin then and the trousers looked goodon me and I should have bought them,(TH IN  ~ LG) A STa.
but I didn't and now I am not and theywouldn't.- ,BT A ('-,THIN ~ -,LG)b. but now I am not and they wouldn't andanyway I didn't.
( - ,THIN --* -,LG) A --,BTc.
?
but now I am not and I didn't and theywouldn't.- ,THIN A -,BT A -~LGHere the antecedent discourse unit consists of threeclauses, the first two can be said to be related bya causal relation (because I was thin, the trouserslooked good on me) whereas the third clause is con-joined to the first two.
Again, several possible contin-uations are given, some of them are acceptable, someof them are not.
This time, the observation is thatin the case where no causal relation can be estab-lished between the appropriate -clauses (i.e.
whenthose clauses corresponding to the cause and to theresult of the cause are not adjacent), the continu-ation is unacceptable 3.
That is, in the case wherean identical relational pattern cannot be established3This observation was originally made in \[Stainton-Ellis 1988\], page 75.for e- and a-clauses, multiple VPE becomes hard tounderstand, if not unacceptable.In what follows, I take these examples to suggestthat the same discourse relation must hold betweena- and e-clauses resepctively.
I characterise this ob-servation in terms of parallelism, make this notionprecise and show how it interacts with other gram-mar components (e.g.
syntax and semantic) to deter-mine multiple VPE resolution.
It should be stressedhowever that the approach can only be as preciseas the definition of discourse relations and unfortu-nately, this notion is notoriously elusive.
Nonethe-less the hope is that this paper captures an impor-tant intuition about multiple VPE resolution amely,the intuition that parallelism constitutes one of the(many) factors affecting multiple VPE acceptabilityand interpretation.3.2 Formal  ana lys i sAssuming a discourse grammar of the type describedin section (2), the claims this paper makes aboutmultiple VPE resolution are (i) that whenever a dis-course contains multiple VPEs, the clauses contain-ing the VPEs and those containing the antecedentVPs form two complex discourse constituents whichare related together by the relation of parallelismand (ii) that parallelism constrains VPE resolutionin that each VPE will resolve to the "parallel VP" inthe complex discourse constituents formed by the a-clauses.
We now make these claims precise.
First, wedefine the semantic representation language ?
usedby the grammar described in section (2).
?
: consistsof the wffs described by the following syntax:wff ~ { term, formula,polarity:rel:\[Wffl .
.
.
wffn\]term --* { variable, constant }formula --* polarity:predicate:\[argl.., argn\]arg --~ { term, formula }rel ~ constantpredicate ~ constantpolarity ~ { 1, 0 }The intuition is that ?
is a quantifier free lan:guage where variables are unification variables andpolarity (i.e.
absence or presence of negation) isalways explicit (that is, non-negated wffs are de-scribed as positive i.e.
marked with 1).
Thus forinstance, the expression 0:and:\[0:p, 1:( d is a wff of/~, which one can think of as the more traditionalpropositional logic formula-~(-,pAq).
We call PROPthe set of wffs of the form polarity:predicate:\[argl .
.
.argn\] 4.
Given this language ?, the discourse relationof para l le l i sm is said to hold between two propo-sitions represented by the / :  wffs ?
and ?
(written,parallelism((I), ql)) iff (I) is structurally identical with?
.
Structural identity is defined as follows:4Note that contrary to tradition negated propositionsare assumed to be atomic wffs.141Definit ion 1 (Structural  ident ity between L:formulae)If ?, ql ?
?, then ?
is structurally identical (or s-identical) with ql (written ?

.
.
?n =selnor(tit) ?
= pl :  ?1,~ = p2 : @x,Pl = P2 and ?1 "--t 92That is, structural identity is identity up to propo-sitional level (where negation is taken to be part ofpropositional information).
To give two simple ex-amples:l :p=,0 :qand1: implies\[l: p, 0: q\] =, 1: implies\[l: r, 0: s\]To state the constraint regulating multiple VPE res-olution, we first define the notion of a yield.Definit ion 2 (Yield)If ?
G ?, then the yield of this semantic representa-tion ?, written y(?
),  is:If ?
?
PROP, Y(?)

y (?

)where, denotessequence concatenationIf ?
= p : tx Y(?)
= Y(?1)Thus the yield of an ?
wit ?
consists of the sequenceof atomic propositions contained in ?.
Finally, westate the constraint as follows:Definit ion 3 (Constra int  on mult iple VPEresolution)Let ?
be the semantic representation associated withthe discourse segment formed by the a-clauses and elbe that associated with the e-clauses.
Then, ifY(?)

.
., Pol4 : 0 .
:  It.
I t t .
\ ]) ,then for 1 < i < n, 0i = 79i and ssi = tti.That is, each elided predicate 0i and argument listtti 5 in 3;(el) resolves to the parallel predicate :Pi andargument list ssi in 31(q~).
To see how this constraintworks, consider example (1).
Suppose that the dis-course grammar assigns to the a- and the e- partof this discourse the following (simplified) semanticrepresentations:A-clauses: 0:and:\[ 0:OM:\[i\], l:GtM:\[i\]\]E-clauses: l:and:\[ 0:rh:\[il, 0:R2:\[i\]\]5The first argument in the list corresponds to the sub-ject NP and is thus ignored.Then definition 3 adequately predicts that R1=OM and R2 = GtM.
That is, the constraint embod-ied in definition 3 implements the fact that multipleVPE resolution is sensitive to the semantic- ratherthan to the surface-ordering of the antecedents.3.3 Implementat ionThe above analysis can be implemented in the dis-course grammar described in section (2) as follows.The parallelism rule will be:IN IN XN OUT1OUT OUT1 OUT OUT2P,.ESTR _ P,.ESTR _SEM 1 :parallelism:\[ SEM1 ,SEM2\] \]IN INOUT \[OUT1, OUT2\]aESIR SEM1 =, SEM2This rule has two effects.
First, it requires thatthe semantic representations of the constituting dis-course constituents be s-identical - this implementsthe restriction stated in defining parallelism.
Sec-ond, it unifies the OUT value of the first discourseconstituent with the IN value of the second - this en-sures that the antecedents provided by the first (pos-sibly complex) discourse constituent are accessible toany VPEs occuring in the second constituent.
Nowconsider the rule for the connective unless (whereUNLESS abbreviates the category associated with un-less):IN IN1 ,UNLESS, IN IN2OUT OUT1 OUT OUT2SEM 0:and:\[0:SEM2,0:SEMt\] \]==~ IN \[IN1, IN2\]OUT \[OUT2, OUTt\]Note that the order of the resulting OUT value is\[Out2, Out1\] (and not \[Out1, Out2\] as suggested bythe surface ordering).
This reflects the fact that mul-tiple VPE resolution is sensitive to the logical- ratherthan the surface-ordering of its antecedents.
Appli-cation of the UNLESS rule to the a-clauses 6 (I wouldn'tgo to Manchester unless I open my mat 0 in example(1) will yield the category (recall that irrelevant at-tributes and attribute values are omitted):SEMINOUT0:and:\[0:open:\[i,mail\], 0:go:\[i,toM\]\] \]\[\[open:\[mail\]\], \[go: [toM\]\]\]6Here, I do not consider the problem raised by theembedding clause I promised myself that.42Similarly, the e-clauses (I didn't so I didn't) will beassigned the category:SEMINOUT~ l:and:\[0:Px:\[ilAsl\], 0:P2:\[i\[ Asll\] \]\[\[PI: As1\], \[P2:As2\]\]Finally, application of the parallelism rule to thesetwo categories will yield:SEMINOUT~arallelism:\[\[~, \ \]\],5\]1 \]where \[~\] = E\ ]  and thus,~\ ]  = l:and:\[O:open:\[i,mail\], 0:go:\[i,toMl\]That is, the uninstantiated variables Pi, P2, ASland Ass in \[~\] have been assigned avalue by means ofunification m such a way as to implement the restric-tion on multiple VPE resolution stated in definition3, and with the result that the semantic representa-tion of the overall discourse is the expected one.4 Structural identity and semanticequivalenceThe approach proposed above relies on the syntacticnotion of structural identity.
However it is a well-known fact that syntactically distinct logical formu-lae may be semantically equivalent.
For instance,(7) p ---+ q ~ --,(p A "-,q) _= --,p V qNow given these logical equivalences, it is un-clear how the semantics of natural anguage discourseshould be represented.
Suppose for instance, that wehave a discourse of the form I f  P, Q.
Then there is achoice as to how this discourse should be represented,namely should it be represented as p --+ q, -~(p ^  -~q)or -~p V q (where p and q represent the semantic on-tent of the discourses P and Q related by i f )  ?
Tra-ditionally, it is assumed that such a discourse willtranslate to what could be called the canonical formi.e p ~ q.
However, the data on multiple ellipses(and the analysis proposed here) suggests that thisshould not always be the only possibility.
As a casein point, consider example (8).
(8) If he is \[t lucky\], he has \[2 ordered his softwarefrom a house that can help\].
If he hasn't 0~,he isn't 01 and may the gods be with himbecause he will need it.Suppose that both a- and e-clauses translate to thecanonical form, we then have the following semanticrepresentations 7:A-clauses: Ax.lucky(x)(i) --+ Ax.buy(x,sw, fhtch)( i)E-clauses: -~791(i) "-* -'792(i)And definition 3 will yield the (wrong) prediction:791 = Ax.lucky(x)792 = Ax.buy( z, sw , f htch )Now suppose that the semantics of the e-clauses(i.e.
-,79,(i) --+ -,79~(i)) is replaced by the semanti-cally equivalent:792(i) ---* 791 (i)Definition 3 will then yield the (correct) predic-tion:792 = Ax.buy(x, sw, fhtch)791 = Ax.lucky(x)So it seems that a given natural language con-nective should be allowed to be ambiguous betweenseveral semantically equivalent but syntactically dis-tinct discourse relations (for instance, if could be as-signed all translations given in (7) above).
But if thisis so, the question then arises as to how this ambigu-ity can be resolved.
The claim I want to make is thatboth the resolution of this ambiguity and the reso-lution of multiple VP ellipses result from a complexinteraction between syntax, semantics and pragmat-ics.
The following section provides ome evidence insupport of this claim.The interaction of parallelism withother levels of linguisticinformationSo far I have argued that multiple VPE resolution issubject o the discourse constraint that the proposi-tions expressed by e- and a-clauses must be relatedby the discourse relation of parallelism.
I have then"shown that due to semantic equivalence, there mightbe several parallel configurations potentially holdingbetween a- and e-clauses.
However the actual datashows little ambiguity: in most cases, the hearer cansingle out the (unique) intended reading.
In this sec-tion, I argue that the discourse constraint of paral-lelism interacts with other sources of linguistic infor-mation to determine this unique reading.
In particu-lar, I argue that syntax, semantics and pragmatics allcontribute to solve the ambiguity raised by semanticequivalences between discourse relations.rTo improve readibility, I use here (and in the restof this section) an informal notation to describe the se-mantics of discourse.
~i represent the semantics of VPEswhere i indicates urface ordering.1435.1 SyntaxConsider again example (8) where the discourseformed by the e-clauses is of the form If P, Q andthe associated semantic representation may be ei-ther p --* q or --q --* --p. Now look at the syn-tax of antecedent and elliptical VPs.
The first el-liptical VP is the perfective auxiliary has and thussubcategorises for a past participle whereas the sec-ond ellipsis consists of copula be and thus selects apredicative phrase.
Correspondingly, the antecedentVPs are (1) a predicative phrase (lucky) and (2) apast participle (ordered his software from a housethat can help).
If we assume that VPE acceptabilityis sensitive to the syntactic information associatedwith the antecedent, then the above observations ex-plain why the discourse relation holding between a-and e-clauses must be --q --~ --p rather than p ---, q.For in the first case hasn't indeed resolves to a pastparticiple (namely ordered his software from a housethat can help) and isn't to a predicative phrase (i.e.lucky); whereas in the second case, the subcategori-sation requirements of the auxiliaries are systemati-cally violated.
Thus if we assume that the (or at leastsome) syntactic properties of the antecedent VPs arerelevant in determining VPE acceptability, then wecan account for the fact that despite of the ambi-guity introduced by semantic equivalences betweendiscourse relations, there is only one reading for (8)i.e.
the reading which is compatible both with thediscourse requirement ofparallelism between a- ande-clauses and with the syntactic onstraints betweeenantecedent and elliptical VP.
As already mentioned(cf.
section 2), the present discourse grammar makesprecisely this assumption since it takes anaphoric in-formation to be sequences ofVP categories i.e featurestructures containing inter alia syntactic informationabout admissible antecedent VPs.5.2 Semantics\[Sag 1980\] argues that VPE is subject to a con-straint on semantic representations, which is dubbedthe alphabetical variant constraint.
The analysis isconvincing in that it accounts for a wide range offacts about VPE and its interaction with other lin-guistic phenomena such as quantification, extrac-tion, pseudo-clefts, ready constructions and equi-sentences.
For instance, the alphabetic variant con-straint will account for the inacceptability of (9)8:(9) If every boy thinks that Mary is in love withhim, the party will be a success.
~ If theydon't, it won't.Note that in this case, discourse parallelism doeshold between a- and e-clanses.
So if discourse paral-lelism (as defined in this paper) was taken to be theonly constraint regulating VPE acceptability, this8To be compared with the well formed: If every boybrings a bottle, the party will be a success.
If they don't,it won't.
(ill formed) discourse could not be rejected by thegrammar.
However, if Sag's constraint is assumedthen the ill-formedness of (9) can be accounted foras follows.
Sag's constraint states that VPE is ac-ceptable iff the semantic representation f the an-tecedent VP (which he assumes to be a lambda b-straction over individuals) is identical tip to renam-ing of bound variables with the semantic represen-tation of the ellipsis and furthermore, all occurencesof a free variable occuring both in the representationof the antecedent and of the ellipsis are bound bythe same operator.
Given this, the ill-formedness of(9) is explained by the fact that the pronoun himis represented by a variable (say, y) which is free inthe semantic representation associated with the an-tecedent VP (i.e.
)~z.think(z, love(m, y))) and can-not be bound by the same operator (i.e.
the universalquantifier introduced by the subject NP every boy)when occuring in the semantic representation f theelliptical VP (because it occurs outside the scope ofevery).Here again, the assumption that the antecedentof a VPE is represented by a monostratal categorymeans that Sag's alphabetic variant constraint caneasily be integrated in the present account.
This canbe done in two ways.
The first possibility consistsin adopting Sag's view and adding a constraint inthe category associated with VP ellipsis auxiliariesto the effect that the semantic representation f theantecedent VP and that of the ellided VP must bealphabetic variants of each other.
This has the incon-venience of requiring aglobal check over the semanticrepresentation f the whole discourse segment con-taining a- and e-clauses, a check which is essentiallynon compositional in nature 9.
A second possibility isto adopt a dynamic semantics (i.e.
a semantics wheremeaning is taken to be a relation between contextsand where a context contains information about pro-noun denotations).
Under such an assumption, it canbe shown that the inacceptability of any discourse vi-olating the alphabetic variant constraint comes outas a failure to interpret his discourse (model theo-retic interpretation simply fails) so that the seman-tic representation f a- and e-clauses need not bechecked upon.
Such an approach is described in\[Gardent 1990\] and could easily be integrated in thepresent framework: it suffices to replace the staticsemantics whose syntax is described in 3, by the dy-namic semantics given in \[Gardent 1990\].5.3 Pragmat icsJust as syntax and semantics, pragmatics can inter-act with discourse constraints o determine multipleVPE acceptability.
A particularly clear illustrationof this interaction comes from the pragmatics ofdis-course connectives i.e.
words such as but, unless, etc.Consider for instance the discourse in (10).9For more details concerning this point, see\[Gardent 1990\].144(10) I gave her some questions to ask you if yourang her.a.
I did but she didn't.b.
, I did but she did.Although both continuations can be viewed as par-allel to the a-clauses (cf.
section 6), only continua-tion (a) is acceptable.
Continuation (b) is inaccept-able because the pragmatics of but (which requiressome contrastive relation to hold between the propo-sitions it relates) is violated.The discourse grammar sketched here does not in-tegrate pragmatic information and thus cannot ac-count for the difference in acceptability between (a)and (b).
Whether it can be extended to do so re-mains an open question although recent work inpragmatics (such as \[Elhadad and McSeown 1990\])suggests that the monostratal, unification based ap-proach to discourse grammar is fully compatible witha comprehensive treatment of the semantics andpragmatics of discourse connectives.6 Taking stockWhile section (3) argues that multiple VPE resolu-tion is subject to the discourse constraint of paral-lelism, section (5) shows that it is also sensitive toother linguistic components such as syntax and se-mantics.
The present section (i) discusses how theresulting overall analysis accounts for the examplesgiven so far, (ii) introduces some additional data and(iii) summarises how the various linguistic modulesinteract in determining VPE acceptability for the setof cases presented throughout the paper.We start by examining the examples given so far.Examples (2) and (ha) are simple cases of discourseparallelism where a- and e-clauses translate to thesame canonical LF and no extraneous factor blocksresolution so that each VPE resolves to the paral-lel element in the antecedent discourse constituent.Example (3) is more intricate and can actually beexplained in two different ways.
A first possibilityis to assume that I should have bought hem and butI didn't form a discourse constituent and, I was re-ally thin and ... the ski-pants looked really good onme and now I'm not and they wouldn't another (theintuition here would be that discourse constituentsreflect the temporal structure of discourse, that is,temporally related events must be part of the samediscourse constituent).
Under this first hypothesis,we have on the one hand a case of (single) VP ellipsiswhere but I didn't resolves to I didn't buy them and onthe other hand a simple case of parallelism betweencomplex discourse constituents 1?.
The second possi-bility is to consider that the three a-clauses form adiscourse constituent which is parallel with the dis-course constituent formed by the three e-clauses.
In1?Thanks to an anonymous referree for pointing outthis po?sible interpretation.this case, the semantic representations of a- and e-clauses can be symbolised as:A-clauses: (T ---* LG) A BTE-clauses: 01 A (02 ---* 03)This clearly does not obey parallelism.
In thiscase, syntax imposes the choice of an equivalent LF(i.e.
(02 --~ 03) A 01 ).
As in (8), this syntactic on-straint stems from the subcategorisation requirementof a VPE auxiliary, namely 'm not which requires apredicative phrase as antecedent.For completeness, consider now the following ad-ditional examples.
(11) I gave her some questions to \[1 ask you\] if you\[2 rang her\].
I did 02 but she didn't 01.
(12) It was preposterous.
It \[1 couldn't possiblywork\].
There \[2 must have been some otherprecautions\].
But there weren't 02 and it did01.
(13) Xenophobia pestis, like the hard native peren-nial it is, bourgeons as lordly young Mediter-ranean male cyclists sail into oncoming traf-fic with such signorial arrogance that even aswe swear and skid, we look round wildly forstreet signs to see if he \[1 's right\], and we\[2 are wrong\] and the one-way system \[3 'sundergone one of its periodic reversals\].
(Heisn't 01.
We aren't 02.
It hasn't 0s.
)(11) illustrates a case where parallelism constrainsthe choice of an alternative semantic representationwith the result that the a-clauses emantics is rep-resented by a wff of the form --(p A --q) rather thanthe canonical semantic translation for discourses ofthe form I f  P, Q i.e.
p ---* q.
Example (12) pro-vides one more illustration of the interaction of syn-tax with discourse in determining multiple VPE reso-lution whereas example (13) illustrates a simple caseof discourse parallelism.The following table summarises these observa-tions.

indicates the num-ber of the example being referred to together with amention of the linguistic module, if any, which forced"the choice of an equivalent semantic representation:D stands for Discourse and S for syntax.
The sec-ond column (Canonical LF) indicates the "canoni-cal" semantic representations (or Logical Forms) ofa- and e-clauses: a-clauses are represented by capitalletter abbreviations which are mnemonic for theirpropositional content, whereas the semantics of el-liptical clauses is represented by 0i where i reflectssurface ordering.
Finally, the third column indicatesan equivalent semantic representation for both e- ora-clauses (or none when this is superfluous).
The in-tuition is that this column also indicates anaphoricdependencies whereby it indicates for each ellipsiswhich is the parallel element in the final semanticrepresentation of the a-clauses.
To take an exam-ple, consider the discourse in (1).
For this discourse145the table indicates that discourse forces the choiceof a non-canonical semantic representation for thea-clauses.
That is, the choice of the non-canonicalsemantic representation is determined in this caseby the discourse requirement that a- and e-clausesstand in a parallelism relation.
As a result, each ellip-sis will resolve to its parallel element in the equivalentLF (rather than the canonical one) i.e.
01 resolves toOM (i.e.
open a big stack of mai 0 and ~)2 to GtM(i.e.
go to Manchester).Ex.

(14) Jon won't dance unless Mary does.In the absence of any additional context, the an-tecedent of the VPE in the second clause is the VP ofthe first clause i.e dance.
Now let us examine againthe discourse rule for unless sketched in section 3.For this rule, the distribution of anaphoric informa-tion can be pictured as follows:\[11, I 2~O1,  02\]Note that anaphoric information is only shared be-tween mother and daughters, not between sisters.This means that the rule sketched in section 3.3 willfail to resolve the VPE in example (14) because inthis case, resolution can only obtain if O1 - I2 i.e.
ifanaphoric information is shared between sisters.
Anobvious fix would be to modify the unless rule so thatIs unifies not only with the IN value of the rightmostdaughter but also with the OUT value of the leftmostdaughter.
The modified rule would then be:\[ SV.M SEM1 \] \[ SEM S~M2 \]IN Ii ,UNLESS, INOUT \ [ \ ]  OUT\[ SEM 0:and:\[0:SEM2,0:SEM1\] \] IN \[I1, \[ \] ,2\]OUT \[02, O1\]However, although this would solve the problemraised by example (14), it would still fail to accountfor cases uch as (15).
(15) (a) Jon won't \[1 dance\] unless (b) Mary does01 and (c) Bob won't \[2 come\] unless (d) Sarahdoes 02.Here the problem is that the new unless rule re-quires the IN value of (d) to unify both with the OUTvalue of (b) i.e.
dance and with the OUT value of (c)i.e.
come.
Clearly unification fails and thus example(15), although perfectly well-formed, is rejected bythe grammar.In more general terms, the problem is thatanaphoric information can come to be instantiatedboth in a top-down and in a bottom-up fashion (i.e.through sharing of information between mother anddaughter or through sharing of information betweensisters) 11.
When the two types of information con-flict, unification fails and a perfectly well formed dis-course may be rejected by the grammar.
In otherwords, the grammar will undergenerate.There are several possible solutions to this prob-lem.
A first one would be to privilege one sourceof information over the other, say by means of pri-ority union.
In this way, one anaphoric flow wouldoverwrite the other.
But apart form the computa-tional problems involved in using such rewrite opera-tions at run time, it is also unclear which informationshould be privileged.
Thus although in (15), bottom-up (or local) information seems to prevail, example(16) shows that in some cases, top-down informationmay be strongest:(16) (a) Jon won't go to Manchester unless (b) heopens his mail and (c) Bob won't go to Parisunless (d) he does.alThe first type of anaphoric flow is top-down in thatanaphoric information on the mother may be required tounify with the anaphoric information of some other nodehigher up in the discourse tree, whereas the second typeis bottom-up because the anaphoric information specifiedon the sisters may in turn be required to unify with theanaphoric information carried by some other node lowerdown in the discourse tree.146Here, there is at least one reading where the el-lipsis in (d) resolves to the parallel element (b) (i.e.opens his mail) rather than to the immediately pre-ceding VP (i.e.
go to Paris).
Furthermore it is easyto find cases where the overall discourse is ambigu-ous between a "top-down reading" and a "bottom-up" one.
Thus perhaps a better solution would beto always allow both possibilities and to let the vari-ous modules of the grammar decide which reading isactually available.
The details and the adequacy ofsuch an approach, I leave here as an open researchquestion.A second problem concerning the present paperconcerns the definition of discourse relations and ofequivalence classes over discourse relations.
Here itis perhaps worth stressing that although logical con-nectives have been used throughout the paper to rep-resent discourse relations, these are definitely not asufficient means of characterization.
As a simple casein point, consider a natural language discourse of theform P so Q.
In section 3.2, such a discourse is trans-lated as p A q (where p and q represent the proposi-tional content of the natural anguage discourses Pand Q respectively).
Clearly this translation doesnot exhaust the meaning of the discourse connectiveso :  for instance, the causal ink between p and q isnot accounted for.
More generally, it is clear thatmuch work remains to be done on the semantics ofdiscourse relations before the present analysis of mul-tiple VPE resolution can be adequately tested.Finally, a third question involves the interactionof discourse grammar with anaphora resolution ingeneral.
As already mentioned, the resolution ofmost types of anaphora can be argued to be influ-enced by discourse structure.
It would be interest-ing to investigate in how far the various mechanismsdeveloped to express this constraint are compati-ble.
More specifically, it would be interesting to seewhether the discourse grammar sketched in section2 could be made to account for the complex interac-tion of VPE with other anaphoric phenomena suchas strict/sloppy identity, pronominal and temporalanaphora.8 Conclus ionA model has been proposed of how discourse struc-ture influences multiple VPE resolution.
However,the suggestion is that the analysis generalises to allcases of VPE, that is, that discourse structure is oneof the main factors determining VPE resolution ingeneral.
In this sense, the analysis proposed here fitswell with one of the mainstream idea in discoursetheory, which is that discourse structure constrainsanaphora resolution.
It should also be pointed outthat this analysis includes a treatment ofparallelismsimilar to that developed in \[Asher forthcoming\] andis as such likely to be compatible with the treatmentof sloppy/strict ambiguity proposed there.The.model proposed is characterised by two mainproperties: reversibility and monostratality.
It isreversible because it is characterised in a purelydeclarative manner.
Note in particular that the def-inition of structural identity is entirely independentof any notion of processing and is as such strictlydeclarative.
In practical terms, this means that thismodel can be used both for analysis and for gen-eration.
Monostrata l i ty  (i.e the fact that differentlevels of linguistic information can be stated within acategory) is another important aspect of the modelin that it allows for different knowledge sources tointeract in determining VPE acceptability and res-olution.
A typical example of this interaction is in-volved in the treatment of cases of multiple VPEinvolving semantically equivalent wffs: in such cases,syntax often interacts with discourse information todetermine the correct resolution.
More generally, itcan be argued that VPE is a phenomenon whichsimultaneously involves phonology, syntax, seman-tics and discourse (cf.
\[Lappin and McCord 1990\],\[Gardent 1991\]).
The present model allows for sucha simultaneous interaction and thus improves on se-rial models of VPE resolution (i.e.
models where thevarious levels of linguistic information interact in aserial rather than a simultaneous fashion) such as\[Webber 1978\].The model described in this paper has been imple-mented in SICSTUS PROLOG and runs on a SUN4 computer, It has been tested in analysis as well asin generation mode.Acknolwedgements: I would like to thank Mar-tin van den Berg, Patrick Blackburn, Remko Schaand Henk Zeevat for many helpful comments andsuggestions.References\[Asher forthcoming\] Asher, N.: forthcoming, Refer-ence to abstract objects in English: a philo-sophical semantics for Natural Language meta-physics.
