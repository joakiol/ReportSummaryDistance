PRIMITIVES AND WORDSYorick WilksIst i tuto per Gli StudiSemantici  e Cognit iv iCastagnola, Switzer landWe may useful ly dist inguish betweeninternal and external  questions whendiscussing the use of primit ives forrepresent ing natural  language content anddoing related semantic computations.
Here Ishall give a few examples of internalquestions; go on to explain why I shall  turnimmediately to external  questions; andf inal ly discuss two of the latter: thejust i f icat ion of pr imit ives in general, andthe dist inction, if any, between pr imit ivesand words.What I mean by "internal quest ions"about pr imit ives are detai led considerat ionsabout what semantic pr imit ives to choose, orhow to insert them into larger structures inpart icular  cases so as to represent somecomplex concept or conceptual  relation, etc.These are quest ions that can only arise whenthe general notion of semantic primit ive hasalready been accepted.
It is not possibleto discuss such internal  questions while oneis at the same time answering externalquestions, such as the just i f icat ion ofsemantic pr imit ives i__Dn general.There are fair ly st ra ight forwardinternal  cr i ter ia for the select ion andmaintenance of a pr imit ive vocabulary: thevocabulary should not be obviouslyredundant, with two pr imit ives covering thesame, or nearly the same, range of meaning.If one could show of anyone's suggested setof pr imit ives that this was so, it wouldfol low that he did not have a good set.Secondly, a pr imit ive vocabulary should notbe obviously or iented towards a part icu larsubject area, if it is at the same timeclaimed to be a general  set.
So, forexample, if, in a proffered set of pr imit iveactions, we saw a major i ty  of pr imit ivesconcerned with human bodi ly actions such asmoving, expel l ing, ingesting, etc., we mightwell  wonder how such a system would copewith the express ion of general actions suchas "divide", "separate", "specify","undertake", "delay", etc.Now there would be a drawback incenter ing a contr ibut ion,  for a meeting asgeneral as this one, on only internalquestions.
To my knowledge there are onlytwo effect ive systems (in the AI approach tonatural  language understanding*)  that makeuse of primit ives, namely Schank's (1973a)and my own (Wilks 1972), and therefore anysuch concentrat ion would be something of a*It wi l l  be clear here that I refer only toAI systems.
There were, of course, workingprimit ive systems in the earl ier days ofComputat ional  L inguist ics,  of which the bestknown was perhaps Gardin's  (1965), and inGenerat ive L inguist ics  there is the wellknown work of Fodor, Katz, Postal, Lakoof,McCawley, etc.38private fight.
External\[ questions, however,are of wider interest and it is mycontent ion that, if we fol low certainexternal quest ions through, we can see thatother workers in natural languageunderstanding are also using primit ives,though they may not be aware of the fact.One issue bridges the gap betweeninternal  and external  questions in aninterest ing way, and wil l  serve me here as anew point of departure.
A point ofdi f ference between Schank's view and my ownhas always been over the appearance insemantic representat ions of what appeared tobe simply the surface words of the language.So, for example, in a representat ion of"John shot Mary" by Schank (1973b) therewil l  normal ly appear the Engl ish word "gun".Whereas, in my representat ions,  all one seesare structur ings of the 80 primitives, and"gun" is not one of them.
I have suggestedthat Schank's diagrams are therefore ofmixed type, as between pr imit ives and words.However, I now believe this cr i t ic ism ofmine to have been badly put, and to restupon a confusion, namely that there is someclear d ist inct ion between pr imit ives andnon-pr imit ives (i.e.
surface vocabulary).Histor ical ly,  what happened in Schank'ssystem is clear: he wanted a surface- f reesemantic representat ion without words in it,and has gradual ly  achieved this, mostrecent ly by the e l iminat ion of manynoun-words in favour of Fodor and Katz typeprimit ive lists, as developed by Weber.
Iam proposing now in my own system to reversethe process, as it were, and start ing froman inventory of only pr imit ives (about 54 in1967, now grown to 80, see Wilks (1972)) tobegin to insert nonprimit ives,  i.e.
words,into the formula structures that define wordsenses, but with one important proviso thatI shall now explain.Let us consider the Engl ish act ion"fire at", as a single unit, and itsexpress ion in terms of more pr imit iveconcepts.
I have expressed it unti l  now(1975a) as the formula, or tree structure,below:(*HUM SUBJ) (STRIK GOAL) (, CAUSE) / \(THING MOVE)The structure need not detain us exceptto note that the r ight-most pr imit ive CAUSEis the head, or pr incipal  primitive, of theaction, and the r ightmost THING that iscaused-to-move is, of course, the bullet,whi le the leftmost THING, that is theINSTRument, is the gun.IIIIIIIIIIIiIIIIIIIWhat I now propose to do is to insertEngl ish words into the formula: inpart icular the words "gun" and "bullet", asfollows (in list form):((*HUM SUBJ) ((*ANI OBJE) ((STRIK GOAL)((gun INST) ((bullet MOVE) CAUSE)))))but to do this if and only if there are alsoformulas elsewhere in the system definingthe meanings of "gun" and "bullet" Thus,in the decomposit ion of a formula, two kindsof entit ies may be encountered, pr imit ivesand "words", and if an atom is found that isnot a primit ive then it must be a word andso a formula must exist elsewhere for it.Now, there is a danger of c i rcular i ty in allthis: in that, looking for the formuladefining "gun" as that atom appear ing in theformula for "fire at", we might find aformula that told us (in primitives) that agun was an object used by human beings forfiring at something.
True, but since thehead (rightmost element) of the formula for"gun" wil l  be THING, this re-entrant methodof formula construct ion cannot give lessinformation than formulas consist ing only ofprimitives, as mine have until now.Now, does this method of re-entrantformulas -- re-entrant in the sense ofmentioning formulas inside each other (asthat for "fire at" now mentions that for"gun" and "bullet") -- force me to withdrawthe "mixed-type" cr i t ic ism I made in thepast of Schank's descript ions.
Well, yesand no.
No, in that Schank's use of, say,the word "gun" in the conceptual  dependencyrepresentat ion for "shoot" was notre-entrant in the sense I have defined it.There was, if I understand him, no formulaelsewhere for "gun" in his example: therewas the Engl ish lexeme and no more.
Hence,if a program parsing his system searched ina text for "gun" as the instrument of"shoot", and found "bow and arrow", it wouldbe helpless because it did not find exact lywhat it was looking for -- it would have nodescript ive formula for the sense of "gun"to help it know when it had found roughlythe same sort of thing.
Just as in "Johnshot her with a colt", it would have noinformation with which to separate the horseand gun senses of "colt": it would eitherfind the sought Engl ish lexeme or, as inthese cases, not.But then again, on the other hand, thecr i t ic ism i__ss changed because the claim thatthere should not i__nn princiDle be mixed type(word and primit ive) semantic descr ipt ionsis impl ic i t ly withdrawn by the aboveproposal for re-entrant formulas.
Now thereneed be no serious "theoret ical"considerat ions involved in such a proposal.It can be seen as simply a notat ionalconvenience: in that "gun" in a formula for"shoot" is now just a shorthand form for theformula for "gun" exist ing elsewhere in thesystem.
This makes the formulas easier toread for a human user by avoiding theinsert ion of too much repetit ive mater ia l  interms of pr imit ives into the body of theformula itself.39Yet, there is a more fundamental  pointburied in all this, very much an externalquestion, and one which led me to mis -s ta temy cr i t ic ism of mixed type descr ipt ions inthe past.
Let me now go into this a little:though it is not, as I shall show, intendedto lead to conclus ions that should give anycomfort, either to those who have used mixedtype descr ipt ions in the past or to thosewho wish to avoid primit ive descr ipt ionsaltogether.My basic error was to defend the use ofpr imit ives by impl ic i t ly  assuming that theywere in some way essent ia l ly  different fromnatural  language words, and therefore, thatstructures of pr imit ives were in some waydifferent from structures of naturallanguage words, which is to say, assumingthat a semantic descr ipt ion in terms ofpr imit ives was something other than areduced micro - language,  with all the normalweaknesses and vaguenesses of a naturallanguage.
I now see more clearly that thatis not and cannot be so.
Or, to put themessage of this posit ion paper in a sloganform, there is no escape from a naturallanguage and certainly not via the primit iveroute.Let me take first the .iustificationaspect of this.
Those of us who have usedpr imit ives for some time have all I thinkmade use of the innocent notat ionalconvention of wr it ing primit ives in uppercase letters thus: MAN, CAUSE, TRANS, etc.And I would not wish to change this; it isuseful for indicat ing whether we are, at anygiven moment, descr ib ing a structure in theprimit ive or the surface language.
Thetrouble is that such a usage does inevitablycarry the suggest ion that the upper caseentit ies are something other than (over andabove, or "deeper" than, but anywaydifferent from) the ordinary words they looklike.
And this, of course, is error, pureand simple.
There have certainly beenclaims from some quarters that theseent it ies are quite other: that CAUSE hasalmost a halo around it, and represents, orrefers to, some other kind of entity in thebrain or mind directly.At its crudest, this is just the oldreferent ia l ist  fal lacy moved up a level, asit were.
The low level fallacy, sti l l  al iveand well, is that the meanings of words arephysical  objects.
"Chair", the story goes,s ignif ies by referr ing to things like theone I am sitt ing on, and so therefore do"mind", "action", "fr iendship" and"cunning", though perhaps in a s l ight ly moreroundabout way.
I do not want to discussthis view here, but only to point out thatthe view of pr imit ives under d iscussionholds that primit ives, like words, havetheir meaning/s ign i f i cance in the same sortof way, but in their cases by referr ing tocertain i l l -def ined mental  entities.
I haveargued in detai l  e lsewhere (Wilks 1974) thatthis could not conceivably be so, or beknown even if it were so.But this comic-str ip  phi losophy is notthe heart of the matter: what this view ofpr imit ives does, in real terms, is to leadto research that attempts to justifypart icular sets of primit ives direct ly insome way, and these days that usual ly meanspsychological ly*.
But what I am arguing isthat, if formulas, templates, conceptualdependency structures, etc.
are simplyusages of a language of primitives, then nodirect .justification of the vocabulary makessense, and certainly not any just i f icat ionsof a correct vocabulary, any more than itwould make sense to try to establ ish thecorrect vocabulary of Engl ish or any othernatural language.
It fol lows from this bhatthere can be a variety of pr imit ivelanguages for semantic descriptions, no onenecessar i ly  better or worse than any other,any more than my vocabulary is better orworse than yours if I know 100 Engl ish wordsyou don't, and you know 101 that I don't.In the case of each primit ive vocabulary,the only ult imate test will be the successor fai lure of l inguist ic  computat ions thatmake use of it.Now there are l imits to this sweepingparal lel  between primit ive and naturallanguages.
Clearly, and as I ment ionedearlier, a pr imit ive vocabulary should nothave synonymous primit ives, whereas in anatural language it is often a point ofaesthet ic  pride to have as large a range ofsemi-synonyms as possible: "cemetery" and"graveyard" in English, for example.
Again,there is at least one interest ing piece ofindirect just i f icat ion of a pr imit ivevocabulary, namely the project at SystemsDevelopment Corporat ion that put the wholeof Webster 's  Third Internat ional  Dict ionaryonto tape and counted the rank frequencylist of words used in the def in i t ion ofother words.
That was, ignoring veryfrequent words like "a" and "the", down tothe 80th rank order, pretty close to my ownlist of pr imit ives, and natural ly  I waspleased.
That is what I, like anyone else,would have hoped for; since pr imit ives arein fact used to define the senses of otherwords, we should be happy to be close to thelist used unconsc ious ly  by the makers of alarge and eff ic ient dict ionary.Nevertheless,  and in spite of these twocaveats, it seems to me that a pr imit ivevocabulary is nothing other than a smallnatural  language, and therefore not open tomethods of just i f icat ion unavai lable to anyother natural  language, and that it is amistake to pretend otherwise.
To sum up, ifwords of a natural  language like Engl ish arenot just i f ied nor gain s igni f icance by theirdirect reference to things, but only bytheir function within the overal l  language,then we may expect precisely the same to be*I cannot see that the notion of the"psychological  just i f icat ion of pr imit ives"makes sense, though I would be happy to beshown.
I do not of course refer here towork like ( Johnson-Laird 1974) showing thathumans seem not to store surface language.Such results are quite consistent with a"primit ive hypothesis",  but do not supportit, since they are also consistent with thehypothesis  that human semanticrepresentat ion is not l inguist ic at all, butconsists of, say, binary numbers!40true of a language of primitives, and noamount of wr it ing in upper case letters isgoing to change that fact.Now, if I take this to heart, thatthere is no di f ference at bottom betweenpr imit ives and other words, then I find thatanother cr i t ic ism I have made impl ic i t ly  orexpl ic i t ly  in the past must also becompletely recast.
This concerns theinit ial  representat ion of sentences inPLANNER-type formalisms, where it seems notunnatural  to represent "John is at thestation" as (AT JOHN STATION).I have been tempted to cr i t ic ise suchrepresentat ions,  to myself  at least, on thegrounds that they were simply the Engl ishwords of the sentence (or something verylike them) rearranged in some plausible way,and that therefore nothing had been shown orstructured.
But, as I said, if I take toheart the point that pr imit ive vocabular iesare not essent ia l ly  di f ferent from thosecompris ing more obviously surface words,then I cannot mainta in that cr i t ic ism in thesame way.
Why shouldn't  "John", "at" and"station" be somebody's pr imit ivevocabulary?Now the structural  cr i t ic ism of thismethod of coding up sentences is unaffected.That is to say, l itt le is revealed by such amethod of expression, unless done in a verysystematic  manner*, and it normal ly rel iesover much on our intuit ive apprec iat ion ofthe structure of the or ig inal  sentence, insuch a way as to be not real ly thestructur ing of an example but a mererepro ject ion of the example itself.
To seethis, one only has to think of what it wouldbe like to express the first sentence ofthis paragraph by such a method, the onebeginning "Now the structuralcr i t ic ism..
.etc."
.However, the point at issue here is notthis structural  one but that of the statusOf the items in the descript ion: as I raisedthe question, but did not answer it, whyshould those Engl ish words not be declaredto be part of the pr imit ive vocabulary?
For,if as I have just argued no seriousdist inct ion of type can be mainta inedbetween words and other primitives, whatcould be wrong with that?Well, it is easy to see what is wrong,given that one accepts one other principle:namely, that one s system, whatever  it is,should be extensib le in a non-tr iv ia lmanner.
What weare  now discussing is thefal lacy of the map, to adapt a ph i losophica lcliche.
We have a system claiming torepresent the structure of natural  languagebut which in fact represents it in the way amap would if its scale wasone-mi le- to-one-mi le .
There would besomething wrong** with such a map, that muchis clear, and s imi lar ly  there is somethingwrong with a system which is only extensib leon the same scale as what it represents:  itadds to its pr imit ives (ordinary words in*The only attempt I know to do this sort ofthing systemat ica l ly  is (Sandewall  1972).IIIIIIIIIIIII1IIIIthis case) at the same rate as it adds tothe sentences covered.
I am not trying tosmuggle back any of the dist inct ion betweenprimit ives and non-pr imit ive words that Ihave abjured, but am only pointing out that,if one chooses surface words as one sprimitives, there is nothing theoret ical lywrong, but just the practical (and in viewinsuperable) di f f icult ies of (I) inabi l i tyto state signif icant semanticgeneral izations, and (2) the inabi l i ty toextend one s coverage of the language inanything other than a mi le-to-mile manner.It is for this reason that it still seemspossible, to me, to give up believing in anydifference in principle between primit ivesand other words but still advocate stronglythe use of a sensible selection of words asa reduced, or primitive, sublanguage forsemantic expression.One final point, which is not argumentbut merely the drawing of a bead on a moredistant target.
It is the case that the useof a PLANNER, or Predicate Calculus, type ofrepresentat ion in "semi-Engl ish" that I havejust discussed is int imately associated withthe view that the study of reasoning isdissociable, or decouplable, from the studyof the semantic structure of naturallanguage, and can be pursued in isolation.In (Wilks 1975b) I have raised a number ofdoubts about that view, but here I want toadd another which follows directly from theargument of this paper.If it is true, as I have argued here,that there is no escape from a naturallanguage into some other realm, and that alanguage of representat ion is just anothernatural language whether of primitives or of"semi-English", then it follows that thereis no special extra-terrestr ia l  sphere forthe examination of reasoning*, but onlytranslat ions into another natural language.Hence there is no reasoning about naturallanguage separate from natural language, andall we can do is to choose the language inwhich we prefer to model the reasoning andover which we prefer to compute.
Thus, tocompress things somewhat, we have the choicebetween computing about reasoning in apr imit ive- l ike language, or one reducible toit by the "re-entrant" method I described,or in one like PLANNER semi-Engl ish in whichlittle is made explicit, and which wouldrequire another system to make its internalrelat ionships explicit for any but the mosttr ivial examples.
**One way out I have not discussed here isfor someone to argue that, for therepresentat ion of language, themi le-to-a-mi le scale is not a fallacy,because no signif icant l inguist icgeneral izat ions are possible.
*I am not denying here that somenon- l inguist ic  forms may expl icate ourreasoning about, say, posit ion in space ornumerical  relat ionships; nor am I denyingthat there is reasoning in the sphere ofvision, which is also possessed by dogs, andcannot therefore be l inguistic.
Granted allthat, I am arguing that the sort ofreasoning required to understand theargument of this paper, or of a standardnewspaper editorial,  must (a) be l inguist icin nature, but (b) will not be expl icated inan interest ing and non-c ircular  manner by asystem using ony semi-English.It may turn out that it is moresensible to say that language understandingdepends on reasoning, rather thanvice-versa.
Everyone in A.I.
seems tobelieve it without question, and I have doneno more here than raise a few small doubtsthat it might, after all, turn out to be theother way round.REFERENCESGardin, J., SYNTOL, in Artandi (ed) RutgersSeries on Systems for the Intel lectualOrganizat ion of Information, New Jersey,1965.Johnson-Laird, P., "Memory for Words",Nature, 1974.Sandewali, E., "PCF-2, A f i rst-ordercalculus for expressing conceptualinformation", Dept.
