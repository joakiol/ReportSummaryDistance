The task setting, representationand semantics are defined with respectto pathway model standards and ontolo-gies (SBML, BioPAX, SBO) and docu-ments selected by relevance to specificmodel reactions.
Two BioNLP ST 2013participants successfully completed thePC task.
The highest achieved F-score, 52.8%, indicates that event extrac-tion is a promising approach to support-ing pathway curation efforts.
The PCtask continues as an open challenge withdata, resources and tools available fromhttp://2013.bionlp-st.org/1 IntroductionFollowing developments in molecular biology, bi-ological phenomena are increasingly understoodon the molecular level, as the products of complexsystems of molecular reactions.
Pathway mod-els formalizing biomolecules and their reactionsin machine readable representations are a key wayof sharing and communicating human understand-ing of these phenomena and of developing com-putational models of biological systems (Kitano,2002).
Many pathway models integrate knowl-edge from hundreds or thousands of scientific pub-lications, and their curation requires substantialmanual effort.
To support this effort, we have de-veloped PathText (Kemper et al 2010) which pro-vides a seamless environment integrating a path-way visualizer, text mining systems and annota-tion tools.
Furthermore, automatic processing ofthe domain literature could thus potentially playpyruvate kinase catalyzes the conversion of PEP to pyruvate.GGP +Regulation Conversion Chem ChemicalThemeCause Theme ProductFigure 1: Event representation for a conversion re-action.an important role in the support of pathway cura-tion.Information extraction targeting biomolecularreactions has been a major focus of efforts inbiomedical natural language processing, with sev-eral tasks, resources, and tools addressing in par-ticular protein-protein interactions (Krallinger etal., 2007; Pyysalo et al 2008; Tikk et al 2010).However, most such efforts have employed sim-ple representations, such as entity pairs, that arenot sufficient for capturing molecular reactions tothe level of detail required to support the curationof pathway models.
Additionally, previous effortshave not directly involved the semantics (e.g.
re-action type definitions) of such models.
Perhapsin part due to these reasons, natural language pro-cessing and information extraction methods havenot been widely embraced by biomedical pathwaycuration communities (Ohta et al 2011c; Ohta etal., 2011a).We believe that the extraction of structuredevent representations (Figure 1) pursued in theBioNLP Shared Tasks offers many opportuni-ties to make significant contributions to supportthe development, evaluation and maintenance ofbiomolecular pathways.
The Pathway Curation(PC) task, a main task of the BioNLP Shared Task2013, is proposed as a step toward realizing theseopportunities.
The PC task aims to evaluate the ap-plicability of event extraction systems to pathwaycuration and to encourage the further developmentof methods for related tasks.
The design of thetask aims to address current issues in informationextraction for pathway curation by explicitly bas-ing its representation and extraction targets on ma-67GTP GDPGAPsre1re1 Protein Molecule MoleculeReactantModifier ProductConversion GAPs catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP.GGP +Reg Conversion Chem ChemCause ThemeTheme Product(a) CONVERSIONp38 gamma Pp38 gammaMKK6re1re1MKK6 phosphorylates p38 gamma.Protein ProteinProteinModifier ReactantProductPhosphorylation MKK6 phosphorylates p38 gamma.GGP Phosphorylation GGPCause Theme(b) PHOSPHORYLATIONNF-kappaBp65p50p65p50re1p65 binds to p50.GGP Bind GGPTheme Theme2p65-p50 complex formation.Complex BindingProductp65 and p50 form p65-p50 complex.Protein Protein NC binding ComplexReactant2 ProductReactant(c) BINDINGFigure 2: Illustration of pathway reaction (left), matching representation as an idealized text-bound eventstructure (middle) and applied event representation for statements actually appearing in text (right).jor standards developed in the biomolecular path-way curation community, such as SBML (Huckaet al 2003) and BioPAX (Mi et al 2011), andontologies such as the Systems Biology Ontology1(SBO) (Courtot et al 2011).
Further, The corpustexts are selected on the basis of relevance to a se-lection of pathway models from PANTHER Path-way DB2 (Mi and Thomas, 2009) and BioMod-els3 (Li et al 2010) repositories.
The PC task set-ting and its document selection protocol aim to ac-count for both signalling and metabolic pathways,the latter of which has received comparatively lit-tle attention in recent domain IE efforts (Li et al2013).2 Task settingThe PC task is formulated as an event extractiontask (Ananiadou et al 2010) following the generalrepresentation and task setting first introduced inthe BioNLP ST 2009 (Kim et al 2011).
The pri-mary aim is the extraction of event structures, orevents, each of which can involve any number ofphysical entities or other events in specific roles.The event representation is sufficiently expres-sive to allow the definition of event structures thatclosely parallel the definition of reactions in path-way representations such as SBML and BioPAX.These pathway representations differentiate be-tween three primary groups of reaction partici-pants: reactants (?inputs?
), products (?outputs?
),and modifiers, where the specific roles of modi-fiers can be further identified to differentiate e.g.1http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo/main/2http://www.pantherdb.org/pathway/3http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/reaction catalysts from inhibitors.
Correspond-ingly, the PC task applies the Theme role definedin previous BioNLP ST tasks to capture reactants,introduces a new Product role for products, andapplies the previously defined Cause role and reg-ulatory events to capture modifiers (Figure 2; seealso Section 2.3).It is important to note that while the event repre-sentation allows a one-to-one mapping to reactionsin principle, an annotation scheme cannot guar-antee that actual statements in text map to fullyspecified reactions: in free-form text, authors fre-quently omit mention of some entities taking partin reactions, perhaps most typically to avoid re-dundancies such as in ?p38?
is phosphorylatedinto phospho-p38??
(Figure 2b).
Representationsextracted from explicit statements in text will thusin some cases omit aspects of the correspondingcomplete reactions in pathway models.Systems addressing the PC task are expected toextract events of specific types given 1) free-formtext and 2) gold standard annotation for mentionsof physical entities in that text.
The task annota-tions also include equivalence relations and eventmodifications, a secondary extraction target.
Theannotation types are detailed below.2.1 EntitiesThe entity annotation marks mentions of physicalentities using start and end offsets in text (contigu-ous span) and a type selected from a fixed set.
Thefollowing four entity types are marked in the PCtask: SIMPLE CHEMICAL, annotated with refer-ence to the Chemical Entities of Biological Inter-est (ChEBI) resource (Degtyarenko et al 2008);68Entity type Scope Reference Ontology IDSIMPLE CHEMICAL simple, non-repetitive chemical entities ChEBI SBO:0000247GENE OR GENE PRODUCT genes, RNA and proteins gene/protein DBs SBO:0000246COMPLEX entities of non-covalently linked components complex DBs SBO:0000253CELLULAR COMPONENT parts of cell and extracellular environment GO-CC SBO:0000290Table 1: Entity types, definitions, and reference resources.Event type Core arguments Additional arguments Ontology IDCONVERSION Theme:Molecule, Product:Molecule SBO:0000182PHOSPHORYLATION Theme:Molecule, Cause:Molecule Site:SIMPLE CHEMICAL SBO:0000216DEPHOSPHORYLATION Theme:Molecule, Cause:Molecule Site:SIMPLE CHEMICAL SBO:0000330(Other modifications, such as ACETYLATION, defined similarly.

?Molecule?

refers to an annotation ofany type, either entity or event.
The indentation corresponds to ontological relationships between theevent types: for example, PHOSPHORYLATION is-a CONVERSION and TRANSCRIPTION part-ofGENE EXPRESSION.GENE OR GENE PRODUCT, annotated with refer-ence to gene and protein databases such as UniProt(Consortium, 2011), Entrez Gene (Maglott et al2005) and PFam (Finn et al 2010); COMPLEX,annotated with reference to database resourcescovering complexes; and CELLULAR COMPO-NENT, annotated following the scope of the GeneOntology cellular component subontology(Ashburner et al 2000) (Table 1).
For discussionof the relation between these types and the repre-sentations applied in pathway models, we refer toOhta et al(2011c).In terms of mention types in text, the annotationfor SIMPLE CHEMICAL, GENE OR GENE PROD-UCT and COMPLEX covers entity name mentionsonly, while the annotation for CELLULAR COM-PONENT covers entity name mentions, nominalmentions, and adjectival references (e.g.
?mito-chondrial?
).2.2 RelationsThe PC task defines one relation type, Equiv(equivalence), which can hold between entitymitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, also known as ERK)Gene or gene product GGP GGPEquivEquivFigure 3: Example Equiv annotation.mentions of the same type and specifies that theyrefer to the same real-world entity (Figure 3).These relations are only applied to determine iftwo events match during evaluation, where entitiesconnected by an Equiv relation are considered in-terchangeable.
Gold standard Equiv relations areapplied also for test data, and systems participat-ing in the task are not expected to extract theserelations.2.3 EventsThe event annotation marks references to reac-tions, processes and comparable associations inscope of the annotation using the event represen-tation.
For the definition and scope of the eventannotation, we rely primarily on the Systems Biol-ogy Ontology (SBO), drawing some general typesnot in scope of this ontology from the Gene Ontol-ogy (GO).

We referagain to Ohta et al(2011c) for detailed discussionof the relation between these types and other rep-resentations applied in pathway models.The role in which each event argument (entityor other event) participates in an event is specifiedas one of the following:Theme entity/event that undergoes the effects ofthe event.
For example, the entity that is tran-scribed in a TRANSCRIPTION event or transportedin a TRANSPORT event.Cause entity/event that is causally active in theevent.
Marks, for example, ?P1?
in ?P1 inhibits P2expression?.AtLoc,FromLoc,ToLoc : location in which theTheme entity of a LOCALIZATION event is local-ized (At) in LOCALIZATION events not involvingmovement or is transported (or moves) from/to(From/To) in LOCALIZATION and TRANSPORTevents involving movement.Site site on the Theme entity that is modified inthe event.
Can be specified for modification eventssuch as PHOSPHORYLATION.Participant general role type identifying an en-tity that participates in some underspecified way ina high-level process.
Only applied for the PATH-WAY type.2.4 Event modificationsIn addition to events, the PC task defines a sec-ondary extraction target, event modifications.
Twomodification types are defined: NEGATION andSPECULATION.
Both are binary flags that mod-ify events, the former marking an event as be-ing explicitly stated as not occurring (e.g.
?P isnot phosphorylated?)
and the latter as being statedin a speculative context (?P may be phosphory-lated.?).
Both are defined in terms of annotationscope and semantics identically as in the BioNLPST?09 (Kim et al 2009).2.5 EvaluationThe PC task evaluation applies the standard evalu-ation criteria established in the BioNLP ST 2009.These criteria relax exact matching between goldand predicted events in two aspects: approximatetrigger boundary matching, and approximate re-cursive event matching.
The former allows pre-dicted event triggers to differ from gold triggersby one word, and the latter requires recursively re-ferred events to only match in their core arguments(see Table 2).
We refer to Kim et al(2011) for adetailed definition of these criteria.3 CorpusThis section presents the PC task corpus and itsannotation process.3.1 Document selectionTo assure that the documents annotated for the PCtask corpus are relevant to pathway reactions, weapplied two complementary approaches, both se-lecting documents on the basis of relevance to aspecific pathway reaction.
First, we selected fromthe BioModels repository those pathway modelswith the largest numbers of manually created an-notations referencing a specific PubMed documentidentifier.
For each of these models, we extractedliterature references, selected a random subset,downloaded the documents, and manually filteredto select abstracts that explicitly discuss relevantmolecular reactions.
Second, as only a small sub-set of models include explicit references to the70literature providing evidence for specific pathwayreactions, we applied an alternative strategy wherereactions from a selection of PANTHER DB mod-els were entered into the PathText system (Kem-per et al 2010),4 which is capable of suggest-ing documents relevant to given reactions basedon an SBML model.
We then selected a randomset of reactions to query the system, and manuallyevaluated the highest-ranking documents to iden-tify those whose abstracts explicitly discuss the se-lected reaction.
We refer to Miwa et al(2013a)for a detailed description of this approach.
Table 3presents the pathway models on which the docu-ment selection was based.3.2 Annotation processThe base entity annotation for the PC corpus wascreated automatically using state-of-the-art entitymention taggers for each of the targeted entitytypes.
For SIMPLE CHEMICAL tagging, the OS-CAR4 system (Jessop et al 2011) trained onthe chemical named entity recognition corpus ofCorbett and Copestake (2008) was applied.
ForGENE OR GENE PRODUCT mention detection, theNERsuite5 system trained on the BioCreative 2Gene Mention task (Wilbur et al 2007) corpuswas used.
NERsuite was also applied for CEL-LULAR COMPONENT mention detection, for thistask trained on the Anatomical Entity Mention(AnEM) corpus (Ohta et al 2012).
Finally, COM-PLEX annotations were created using a combi-nation of a dictionary and heuristics making useof the GENE OR GENE PRODUCT annotation (formentions such as ?cyclin E/CDK2 complex?).
Tosupport the curation process, these tools were in-tegrated into the NaCTeM text-analysis workflowsystem Argo (Rak et al 2012).Based on the evaluations of each of these toolsin the studies presenting them, we expected initialautomatic tagging performance to be in the range80-90% in both precision and recall.
Followinginitial automatic annotation, the entity mention an-notation was manually revised to improve qualityand consistency.
As the entity annotation is notitself a target of extraction in the shared task, wedid not separately evaluate the consistency of therevised entity mention annotation.To assure that the quality and consistency ofthe event annotation are as high as possible, ini-4http://nactem.ac.uk/pathtext/5http://nersuite.nlplab.org/Item Train Devel Test TotalDocuments 260 90 175 525Words 53811 18579 35966 108356Entities 7855 2734 5312 15901Events 5992 2129 4004 12125Modifications 317 80 174 571Table 4: PC corpus statisticstial event annotation was created entirely man-ually, without automatic support.
This annota-tion effort was carried out using the BRAT anno-tation tool (Stenetorp et al 2012) by a group ofbiologists in collaboration between NaCTeM andKISTI.
Following initial annotator training and re-finement of guidelines based on the event type def-initions provided by the reference ontologies, theprimary event annotation was created by three bi-ologists.
To evaluate and maintain annotation con-sistency, a random 20% of documents were an-notated redundantly by all annotators, and theseoverlapping annotations were periodically evalu-ated and differences in annotation were discussedbetween the annotators and annotation coordina-tors.
Following initial annotation, a round of semi-automatic consistency checks were applied usingBRAT.
Evaluation of the redundantly annotateddocuments using the primary task evaluation cri-teria gave an inter-annotator agreement of 61.0%in F-score.
For the final corpus, the redundantlyannotated documents were evaluated separately byan annotation coordinator to select the best of eachset.6The overall statistics of the corpus are summa-rized in Table 4.
We note that the among theprevious BioNLP ST corpora, only the GENIA(GE) task corpus has a larger number of annotatedevents than the PC corpus.4 Results4.1 ParticipationTwo groups submitted final results to the PCtask, one from the National Centre for Text Min-ing (NaCTeM) and one from the University ofTurku BioNLP group (TEES-2.1) (Table 5).
Bothparticipants applied their well-established, state-of-the-art event extraction systems, EventMine7(Miwa et al 2012) (NaCTeM) and the Turku6This selection implies that the consistency of the eventannotation of the final corpus is expected to exceed the 61%F-score of the IAA experiment.

The two systems share the same over-all architecture, a one-best pipeline with SVM-based stages for event trigger detection, trigger-argument relation detection, argument groupinginto event structures, and modification prediction.The feature representations of both systems drawon substructures of dependency-like representa-tions of sentence syntax, derived from full parsesof input sentences.
TEES applies the Charniakand Johnson (2005) parser with the McClosky(2009) biomedical model, converting the phrase-structure parses into dependencies using the Stan-ford tools (de Marneffe et al 2006).
By contrast,EventMine uses a combination of the predicate-argument structure analyses created by the deepparser Enju (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008) and the out-put of the the GDep best-first shift-reduce depen-dency parser (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007).
All threeparsers have models trained in part on the biomed-ical domain GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al 2005).Interestingly, both systems make use of the GEtask data, but the application of EventMine ex-tends on this considerably by applying a stackedmodel (Miwa et al 2013b) with predictions alsofrom models trained on the BioNLP ST 2011 EPIand ID tasks (Pyysalo et al 2012) as well as fromfour corpora introduced outside of the shared tasksby Thompson et al(2011), Pyysalo et al(2011),Ohta et al(2011b) and Ohta et al(2011c).4.2 Evaluation resultsTable 6 summarizes the primary evaluation results.The two systems demonstrate broadly similar per-formance in terms of F-scores, with NaCTeMachieving an 1.7% point higher overall result.8http://jbjorne.github.io/TEES/However, the systems show quite different per-formance in terms of the precision/recall balance:while the NaCTeM system has little differencebetween precision and recall, TEES-2.1 shows aclear preference for precision, with 8.6% lower re-call than precision.Results are shown separately for each event typein Table 7.
The results largely mirror the over-all performance, with the NaCTeM system show-ing better performance for 13 out of the 21 eventtypes present in the test data and more balancedprecision and recall than TEES-2.1, which em-phasizes precision over recall for almost all eventtypes.
Although the results do not include evalu-ation of EventMine with a reduced set of stackedmodels in training, the modest difference in per-formance suggests that comprehensive use of pre-viously released event resources in EventMine didnot confer a decisive advantage, perhaps in partdue to differences in the event definitions betweenthe PC task and previous resources.Overall, the two systems appear quite similarnot only in architecture but also performance, withthe clearest systematic difference observed beingthe different emphases on precision vs. recall.
Asboth systems are based on machine learning meth-ods with real-valued outputs, it would be relativelystraightforward to use prediction confidences toanalyse performance over the entire precision-recall curve instead of a single fixed point.
Suchanalysis could provide further insight into the rel-ative strengths and weaknesses of these two sys-tems.5 DiscussionAlthough participation in this initial run of the PCtask was somewhat limited, the two participatingsystems have been applied to a large variety ofevent extraction tasks over the last years and haveshown consistently competitive performance withthe state of the art (Bjo?rne and Salakoski, 2011;Miwa et al 2012).

Given the novelty of the task domain andreference resource and the broad selection of doc-uments, we find the results highly encouraging re-garding the applicability of event extraction tech-nology to supporting the development, evaluation,and maintenance of pathway models.6 ConclusionsThis paper presented the Pathway Curation (PC)task, a main event extraction task of the BioNLPST 2013.
The task was organized in collaborationbetween groups with an interest in pathway cura-tion with the aim of evaluating and advancing thestate of the art in event extraction toward methodsfor developing, evaluating and maintaining formalpathway models in representations such as SBMLand BioPAX.
We introduced an event extractiontask setting with reference to pathway model stan-dards and the Systems Biology Ontology, selecteda set of 525 publication abstracts relevant to spe-cific model reactions, and created fully manual73event annotation marking over 12,000 event struc-tures in the corpus.Two participants in the BioNLP ST 2013 sub-mitted final predictions to the PC task, applyingestablished, state-of-the-art event extraction sys-tems, EventMine and the Turku Event Extrac-tion System.
Both systems achieved F-scoresover 50%, with the EventMine system achiev-ing the best overall result of 52.8%.
This levelof performance is broadly comparable with re-sults achieved in comparable previously proposedtasks, indicating that current event extraction tech-nology is applicable to the projected pathway cu-ration support tasks.To allow the further development and evalua-tion of event extraction methods for the task, thePC task continues as an open challenge to all inter-ested participants, with the annotated corpus data,supporting resources, and evaluation tools avail-able under open licenses from the task homepage,http://2013.bionlp-st.org/AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Yonghwa Jo, HyeyeonChoi, Jeong-Ik Lee and Ssang-Goo Cho ofKonkuk University for their contribution to the de-velopment of the relevance judgment annotationcriteria.
