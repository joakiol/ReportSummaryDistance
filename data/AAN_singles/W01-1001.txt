Knowledge PortalsDr.
Steffen StaabSenior Researcher and LecturerKnowledge Management GroupApplied Computer Science Institute (AIFB)University of Karlsruhe, Germanysst@aifb.unikarlsruhe.dewww.aifb.unikarlsruhe.de/ sstKnowledge portals provide views onto domainspecific information on the WorldWide Web, thus facilitating their users to find relevant, domainspecific informa-tion.
The construction of intelligent access and the provisioning of information toknowledge portals, however, remained an ad hoc task requiring extensive manualediting and maintenance by the knowledge portal providers.
In order to diminishthese efforts we use ontologies as a conceptual backbone for providing, accessingand structuring information in a comprehensive approach for building and main-taining knowledge portals.
We have built several experimental and one commercialknowledge portal for knowledge management tasks such as skill management andcorporate history analysis that show how our approach is used in practice.
Thispractice, however, has exhibited a number bottlenecks, many of which could beavoided or at least diminished by Human Language Technology.
We have usedHLT in order to reduce the costs of ontology engineering and in order to narrowthe gap between finding knowledge in texts and providing it to the portal.
