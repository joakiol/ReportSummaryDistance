Proceedings of the Workshop on Linguistic Distances, page 7,Sydney, July 2006. c?2006 Association for Computational LinguisticsSemantic Similarity: What for?Ido DaganBar Ilan Universitydagan@macs.biu.ac.ilAbstractLinguistic similarity has been a promi-nent notion and tool in computational lin-guistics and related areas, as elaboratednicely in the announcement of this work-shop.
Yet, what exactly counts as ?sim-ilarity?, or when two linguistic conceptsshould be regarded as similar, often re-mains rather vague and ill posed, which isin fact quite typical for unsupervised no-tions.
This talk will focus on similarityat the semantic level, and will explore theperspective that different notions of simi-larity may be defined relative to concretemodeling goals.
In particular, I will referto the two major goals in semantic mod-eling: predicting likelihood of occurrence,which is the typical goal in disambigua-tion and language modeling, and recogniz-ing target meanings, which is the typicalsemantic goal in text understanding appli-cations such as question answering, infor-mation extraction, summarization and in-formation retrieval.
We will discuss eachgoal and present corresponding semanticsimilarity approaches.7
