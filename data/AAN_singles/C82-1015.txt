These representations, or"logical forms," are intended to be a purely formal language that is as close aspossible to the structure of natural language, while providing the semanticcompositionality necessary for meanlng-dependent computational processing.
Thedesign of DIALOGIC (and of its constituent modules) was influenced by the goal ofusing it as the core language-processlng component in a variety of systems, someof which are transportable to new domains of application.Currently DIALOCIC is a core component of four systems being developed withinsevera l  d i f fe rent  research  pro jec ts  a t  SRI.

The t rans la tor  fo r  each  phrase-s t ructure  ru le  spec i f ies  how the  var ious  const i tuents  o f  the  phrase  are  to  becombined to  fo rm an  in terpretat ion  o f  the  wbo l~ phrase .

The actual construction of a logicalform is done in two phases: (I) ioglcal-form fragments (iffs) are attached to theparse  t ree  by the bas ic  semantic funct ions ;  (2) the f ina l  l og ica l  form i sassembled from these by the scoplng algorithm.Lf fs  are ass igned only  to cer ta in"  nodes in  the parse t ree .
Usual ly  the i f f  a t  anNP node w i l l  encode the proper t ies  held by the ent i ty  the NP descr ibes  \ [e .g .
,  "Xsuch that  EMPLOYEE(X) & OLD(X)" for  "old employee"\] and the fragment for  a c lause-level construction (e.g., a VP) will encode the predlcate-argument structure ofthe clause,The basic semantic functions also leave markers on the parse tree to indicate suchthings as the type of quantifier or deter~iner associated with a noun phrase.These markers are used by the scoplng algorithm to determine the final loglcalform for the utterance.
(Note that the Iffs and markers left by the basicsemantic functions may be viewed as further annotations to the parse tree.
)DIALOGIC currently includes eleven basic semantic functions.
Six of these do mostof the work of buildlng lffs for standard noun phrases and clauses.
The othersare concerned with adding such things as mode, degree, and adverbial modificationto clauses.
As more precise specifications are defined for encoding thesephenomena in logical form, we expect to collapse some of this latter group.SCOPING OF QUANTIFIERS AND OTHER SENTENTIAL OPERATORSThe scoplng algorithm is designed to collect the loglcal-form fragments from theparse tree and produce the possible scoplngs of quantlflers and other scopedoperators.
The scoplng algorithm used in DIALOGIC (adapted from that inHendrlx, 1978) produces all the scoplngs thnt do not vlolate the hard rules ofEngllsh scoplng, and then ranks them according to a score computed by a set ofspeciallst critics.
Each critic is a function that returns a score for someaspect of the conflicting rules of quantification in Engllsh; e.g., the left-rlghtscope critic lowers the score of 8coplngs that involve permuting the left-outermost default ordering of quantlflers.
All critics receive equal weight inthe present implementation, but the design of the system does allow ford i f fe rent ia l  we ight ing .The current set of critics is concerned with such things as changes in sentenceorder and the relatlve scoplng of  quantlflers of different strengths.
The scoplngof nonstandard quantlflers and of the generallzed negative ("not, .... no one,""nothing, .... none") remain to be done.BASIC PRAGMATIC FUNCTIONSBasic pragmatic functions are intended to fulfill several roles in DIALOGIC, allconcerned with certain kinds of indetermlnacles in logical form whose resolutionrequires pragmatic information.
The four primary uses of basic pragmatic98 B. GROSZ et -1.funct ions  in  the cur rent  system are  ( i )  ~o provide a context -spec l f l cinterpretation of certain terms that have only vague meanings in themselves (e.g.,prepositions llke "of" and "~n~" or Inherently vague verbs llke "have"); (2) toestabllsh the specific relationship underlying any given noun-noun combination;(3) to identify the referents of pronouns; and (4) to interpret a limited range ofmetonymy (e.g., the use of "blonds" to mean "people with blond hair").
Atpresent, only a small core of pragmatic functions is implemented, each of whichhandles only a subset of the cases it is intended to cover.EXAMPLETo illustrate how the different modules' of DIALOGIC contribute to theinterpretation of an utterance, we shall consider the example,"What SRI employees have children older than 15 years?
"The logical form for this query--the target for the interpretation processes--Is(lowercase is used to indicate variables, uppercase to indicate constants andpredicates):\[QUERY (WH employeel (AND (EMPLOYEE employeel)(EMPLOYEES-COMPANY-OF employeel SRI))(SOME child2 (CHILD child2) (AND (CHILD-0F employeel child2)((*MORE* OLD) child2 (YEAR 15\]This corresponds rou@hly to a formal representation for "who is each employee suchthat the company of the ~nployee is SRI and some child of the employee is olderthan fifteen years?
"During DIAMOND'S parsing phase, the parse tree in Figure I is constructed.
Atthis polnt~ the attributes annotating the tree encode such properties as the typeof noun (count, mass~ unit) and syntactic number.
These attrlbutes have been usedduring the parsing phase to rule out certain alternative structures.Once this structure is built, the translators are invoked.
In combination withthe basic semantic functions, the translators assign addltlonal attributes tonodes in the tree, encoding such information as the quantlflers (type~ strength,and the variables they bind) and heads of noun phrases.
For example~ the head ofthe WHNP, "what SRI employees"m is a variable of type EMPLOYEE that 14 bound by awiT-type quantifier.
Attributes also encode the underlying predlcate-argumentstructures for verb phrases and adJectlves~ and the iffs to be used inconstructing the flnal logical form for the utterance.In the sentence of Figure I, the nodes WHNP and S are annotated as beingquantlfledp WHNP with a wh-type quantifier and S as a "query."
Although everyrule has an associated translator, only some of these result in iffs beingattached to nodes.
For this example~ the nodes marked with *e in the originalparse tree are the only ones for which Iffs are produced.The fragment attached to each of these nodes is as follows:NOUN1 (*NN* employeel SRI)NOUN2 (EMPLOYEE employee1 )PREDICATE (*HAVE employee1 ch i ld2)NOUN3 (CHILD child2)NCOMP ((*MORE* OLD) child2 (YEAR 15))EMPLOYEE, CHILD, and OLD are" monadlc predicates that are part of the conceptualmodel of the domain.
*MORE e maps a predicate into a comparative along the scalecorresponding to the predicate.
*NN* and *HAVE are dummy predicates that indicatethe need tO invoke the basic pragmatic functions.After the translation process is complete, the final loglcal form is asseLbled bya procedure that considers alteruatlve quantifier scoplngs (using the quantifier-DIALOGIC, A CORE-NATURAL-LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM 99/I / - - - -  - - \MSDET NO~DINOUHI **I/ \NHD NOUN2 **\[-S N/VPTtV4JI\.WHAT SRI '-S B~q,OYEE HAVE -'8/ \SNHQ ENDPUNCTJ i?/mtNorM3 **f /----~-S NPREDICATE **tVPI \NP \[\NCONFStNCOMP *tfPREDADJI /~  -------~ADJTI i / \ /------ ~ \ER ADJ THANfII III / - -I Ii II ICHILD ER OLD THAN l$HPfDETPJDEI'QIImUNi /---- ---~?

Besides the WH quantifying employee1,TEAM recognizes that a default existential quantifier must be created for child2~so SOME is added.
The scope rules force QUERY to have the widest scope; thisposition 18 contested only if there are multiple sententlal markers.
Bothorderlngs of the WHAT and SOME quantlflers are generated.
The two resultlngquantified statements correspon d to (WHAT employeel (SOME child ...)...) and(SOHE child (WHAT employee ...)...)Next the scope critic functions evaluate the different scoplngs; only three of thecritics are relevant.
One critic considers the left-right node ordering andprefers the first scoplng because it comes closer to the surface form, One criticprefers scoplngs in which WH outecopes an adjacent exlstential; it too upgradesthe score of the first and downgrades the score of the second.
The other criticknows that default existential quantlflers need the narrowest possible scope; ittoo selects the  first.100 B. GROSZ et alSUMMARYBecause of the modularlzation in D~ALOGIC, changes in one part of the systemreverberate very little in other components.
Changes in the constraints imposedon the phrase-structure rules in the grammar have no effect on any other part ofthe system.
A change in a rule itself necessitates a change in the correspondingtranslator, but the basic semantic functions do not need to be revised.Similarly, a change in the logical form or in the data structures within which itis implemented requires a corresponding change in the basic semantic functions,but not in the grammar or translators.In addition to extending DIALOGIC as mentioned in the foregoing sections, we arealso investigating possible revisions of the translation phase (as currentlyperformed by the translators and basic semantic functions) to allow translationinto loglcal form to be specified declaratlvely.
In this new approach\[Rosenscheln and Shleber (to appear)\[, loglcal types are associated with thephrasal categories, and the translation of a phrase is synthesized from thetranslations of its immediate constituents according to a local rule, whichtypically involves functional application.REFERENCESDowty, D.
