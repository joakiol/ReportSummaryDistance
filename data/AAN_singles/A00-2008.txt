Itbriefly explains the theory of frame semanticson which semantic annotation is based,discusses possible applications of FrameNetannotation, and compares FrameNet o otherprominent iexical resources.IntroductionThis paper presents the tagset used to annotatethe predicate-argument structures of Englishverbs, adjectives, and nouns in the BerkeleyFrameNet Project (NSF IR\]-9618838, "Tools forLexicon Building"), a corpus-basedcomputational lexicography project based on thetheory of frame semantics (see Fillmore 1982).It briefly explains the theoretical background andshows how frame-semantic annotation createslexicographic generalizations that are notpossible with more traditional linguisticapproaches to argument structure based onthematic roles.1 The FrameNet Project1.1 What is frame semantics?Frame semantics characterizes the semantic andsyntactic properties of predicating words byrelating them to semantic frames.
These areschematic representations of situations involvingvarious participants, props, and other conceptualroles, each of which is a frame element (FE).The semantic arguments of a predicating wordcorrespond to the FEs of the frame or framesassociated with that word.Frames are organized in a structure that canbe modeled by an inheritance lattice.
They rangefrom being very general, like case frames(Fillmore 1968) or other simple event schemasunderlying thematic roles, to being lexicallyspecific.
The most interesting frames are those atan intermediate level of specificity whichencapsulate generalizations about the semanticand syntactic properties of word classes that areoverlooked by thematic role analyses.1.2 An exampleOne example is the commercial transactionframe, which includes the following FEs: Buyer,Seller, Goods, and Money.
The followingsentence schemas show how these FEs areexpressed ifferently by different CommercialTransaction words:Buyer bought Goods from Seller for MoneyBuyer paid Seller Money for GoodsBuyer paid Money to Seller for GoodsSeller sold goods to Buyer for MoneySeller sold Buyer Goods for MoneyBuyer spent Money on Goods(Seller not expressed)Goods cost Buyer Money(Seller not expressed)Different words assign the CommercialTransaction FEs to different Phrase Types (PTs)and Grammatical Functions (GFs).
For example,buy treats the Buyer as an NP subject (i.e.56External Argument) and the Seller as a PPcomplement headed by from, while sell treats theBuyer as a direct object or a PP complementheaded by to and the Seller as a subject.
Thepurpose of FrameNet annotation is to gatherinformation like this about the grammaticalrealization of FEs for various frames.1.2 Project goalsThe goals of the project are to create a databaseof information about English words and theframes they inherit, provide annotated corpusexamples that illustrate how information aboutFEs is expressed by complements and modifiersof these words in attested sentences, andcontribute to a suite of software tools to supportannotation, database building, and databaseinterface.An important part of FrameNet work is theannotation of corpus sentences with frame-semantic information.
We use the BritishNational Corpus (BNC), because no equallycomprehensive corpus exists for AmericanEnglish (though efforts are underway to create acomparable American National Corpus--seeFillmore et al 1998).
Each annotated examplesentence shows argument-structure properties ofone target verb, adjective or noun.
The maintask of annotation is to tag the arguments (andoccasionally modifiers) of the target with thenames of the FEs that they express.
A secondarytask is to mark other lexicographically relevantelements, uch as support verbs of target nouns,and certain non-meaningful elements thatindicate lexicographically relevant grammaticalconstructions (e.g.
extraposition and theexistential construction).
(See Fillmore & Atkins1998 on lexicographic relevance.
)Here is an example sentence from the BNCshowing the annotation properties of thecomplements of the target verb tell:(1) \[Maltravers (Speaker, NP, Ext)\] decided notto tell\[Stephen (Addressee, NP, Obj)\]\[about the inscription in the Le Carr6 book(Topic, PPabout, Comp)\].The annotated constituents appear in brackets.Following each constituent is a set ofparentheses containing the FE, PT and GFassociated with that constituent (actualannotations consist of XML markup createdusing the Alembic Workbench software from theMitre Corporation).
PT and GF information isadded by an automatic phrase labeler developedby the technical team.2 The FrameNet agset2.1 Phrase TypesBelow are the FrameNet Phrase Types.
This isintended to be a comprehensive list of the typesof syntactic onstituent that can express FEs ofmajor predicating words of English (nouns,verbs and adjectives).
These constituents occureither as arguments or as lexicographicallyrelevant modifiers.
In constructing this list, wemade extensive reference to the Comlex syntax(Meyers et al 1995).2.1.1 Noun phrase typesNP Noun phrase (the witness)N Non-maximal nominal (personal chat)Poss Possessive NP (the child's decision)There Expletive there (there was a fight)It Expletive it (it's nice that you came)2.1.2 Prepositional phrase typesPP Prepositional phrase (look at me)Ping PP with gerundive object (keep fromlaughing)Part Particle(look it up)2.1.3 Verb phrase typesVPfin Finite verb phrase (we atefish)VPbrst Bare stem VP (let us eatfish)VPto To-marked infinitive VP (we want to eatsh)VPwh WH-VP (we know how to win)VPing Gerundive VP (we like winning)2.1.4 Complement clause typesSfinSwhSifSingStoSfortoSbrstFinite clause (it's nice thatyou came)WH-clause (ask who won)lflwhether clause (ask if we won)Gerundive clause (we saw them running)To-marked clause (we want them to win)For-to-marked clause (we would like forthem to win)Bare stem clause (we insist that theywin)57In certain cases FrameNet marks as twoconstituents what are treated as "small clauses"in some analyses.
For example, in the sentence Iconsider Pat a genius, Pat and a genius wouldbe tagged separately.2.1.50therphrase typesAjP Adjective phrase (an interesting idea)AdvP Adverb phrase (you put that nicely)Quo Quote ("Indeed, "she said)2.2 Grammatical FunctionsBelow is a list of the FrameNet GFs.
This list isintended to characterize all the grammaticalcontexts relative to English verbs, adjectives andnouns that are regularly occupied by FE-expressing constituents.
In this list, we do notmake the traditional distinction between obliquesand arguments/complements (the former aresimply PP complements).2.2.1 FrameNet grammatical functionsExt External Argument(Argument outside phrase headed by target verb,adjective or noun)Comp Complement(Argument inside phrase headed by target verb,adjective or noun)Mod Modifier(Non-argument expressing FE of target verb,adjective or noun)Xtrap Extraposed(Verbal or clausal complement extraposed toendof VP)Obj Object(Post-verbal argument; passivizable or does notalternate with PP)Pred Predicate(Secondary predicate complement of target verbor adjective)Head Head(Head nominal in attributive use of targetadjective)Gen Genitive Determiner(Genitive Determiner of nominal headed bytarget)2.3 Nonexpression of FEsBesides being expressed by the PTs and GFslisted above, FEs may remain unexpressed underthe different conditions discussed below (seeFillmore 1986).2.3.1 Indefinite Null lnstantiationIn sentence (1), the FEs Message, Medium andCode are not expressed.
It can however beinferred that there must be a Message, Mediumand Code in a communicative event of the typedescribed by this sentence.
These FEs, whileconceptually present in this sentence, areoptionally expressed, and there are no particularrestrictions on their nonexpression.
This is calledIndefinite Null Instantiation (INI).2.3.2 Definite Null InstantiationWith some words, an FE may be unexpressed ina sentence only if it assumed that the person towhom the sentence is addressed has specificinformation about he frame element in question.This kind of non-expression is called DefiniteNull Instantiation (DNI).
For example, thewords tell, inform and notify allow a Message tobe omitted when it is clear what the Message is,e.g.
How did I know you won?
Because Patalready tom me.2.3.3 Constructionally licensed nullinstantiationCertain grammatical constructions, such asPassive and Imperative, allow an ExternalArgument FE to be unexpressed, e.g.
Harshthings were said, Tell me about yourself.
This isConstructionally Licensed Null Instantiation(CNI).FrameNet annotation marks prominentunexpressed FEs as well as FEs that areexpressed overtly.
In order to achieve this, weplace the symbols INI, DNI and CNIimmediately after the target word in everyannotated sentence, and place the appropriate FEtag on the appropriate symbol.
For example, thecase of DNI discussed above would be annotatedas follows:(2) \[Pat (Speaker)\] already told INI \[DNI(Message)\] CNI \[me (Addressee)\].582.4 Frame ElementsFrames are organized into the followingdomains: Body, Chance, Cognition,Communication, Emotion, Health, Life Stages,Motion, Perception, Society, Space, Time,Transaction, and a General domain.
Eachdomain contains everal frames that characterizedifferent word classes.
Because there are manyframes, it is not possible to give the complete listof FEs.
The next section discusses FEs from theCommunication domain.3 Communication framesIt is typically the case that different frames in thesame domain share FEs.
For that reason, eachdomain can be characterized by a basic framethat defines its FEs in general terms, and morespecific frames, corresponding to word classes,that are based on this basic frame throughinheritance or some other principled relation.
Letus consider the basic frame of verbalcommunication.3.1 Basic Verbal Communication frameThe following FEs consistently appear in framesrelating to verbal communication:Speaker(A person who performs an act of verbalcommunication)Addressee(An actual or intended recipient of a verbalmessage)Message(A communicated proposition)Topic(The subject matter of a message)Medium(A physical channel of communication)Code(The language or other code used tocommunicate)These FEs all derive their meaning from theconcept of a basic communicative event.
Clearlya true frame representation cannot just consist ofa list of role names, but must characterize suchevents.
Currently FrameNet frame descriptionsexist only in text form, but the ultimate aim is toexpress them in a machine-readable format.
Animportant component of such a representationwill be feature structures that express relationsbetween frames symbolically.
These might becombined with computational event models thatare able to generate inferences, such as the x-schemas developed by Bailey et al (1997) andNarayanan (1997).The FEs of the Basic Verbal Communicationframe are relevant o sentence (1) above, inwhich the Speaker is expressed as an NP Ext, theAddressee is expressed as an NP Obj, and theTopic is expressed as a PP Comp headed byabout.
The other FEs are not expressed.We will examine how the FEs above arerealized in different Communication frames, andin the process, will see some of the kinds ofgeneralizations that can be expressed throughframe-semantic lexical analysis.3.2 Other frames in the Communication domainThe Basic Verbal Communication framecharacterizes vents of verbal communication inthe most general terms.
DifferentCommunication words represent different ypesof communicative event and different ways ofconstruing such events.
Generalizations overthese words are captured by different frames inthe domain.
Some focus on, or profile, inLangacker's (1987) terminology, the relationbetween a Speaker and a propositional Message.These are grouped into frames characterizingdifferent speech acts, e.g.
asking (Questioningframe), requesting (Request frame), asserting(Statement frame), and promising (Commitmentframe).
A few words profile the relation betweena Speaker and an act of speaking, but not thepropositional Message communicated (talk,speak).
Some denote events of reciprocalcommunication (e.g.
discuss, argue,conversation, etc.).
And so on.The following sections ummarize propertiesof specific frames, and discuss someassumptions about the ontology of theCommunication domain that might account forthese properties.3.3 The Statement frameVerbs and nouns in the Statement frame profile arelation between a Speaker and a propositional59Message that has the speech act status of anassertion.
Because of the importance of theMessage FE, these words frequently occur withSfin Comp (finite clausal complements):(3) \[Others (Speaker, NP, Ext)\] assert \[thatanthropology is the tree and sociology the branch(Message, Sfin, Comp)\].
(4) \[Managers (Speaker, NP, Ext)\] claim \[therewas no radiological hazzard to staff or the public(Message, Sfin, Comp)\].
(5) \[His (Speaker, Poss, Gen)\] claims \[to havemore energy (Message, VPto, Comp)\] are simplylaughable.Message can be expressed with different PPs aswell.
For example, with the target noun claim, itcan be expressed as a to-marked infinitive VP, asin example (5).3.4 The Speaking frameVerbs and nouns in the Speaking frame profile arelation between a Speaker and an act ofspeaking, but do no allow a Message to beexpressed:(6) \[She (Speaker, NP, Ext)\] never spoke \[abouther feelings (Topic, PPabout, Comp)\].This fact can be explained if we analyze thebasic meaning of Speaking words as beingsomething like 'X say something'.
The Messagerole can be thought of as being incorporatedinto this meaning, with incorporation i this casebeing equivalent to obligatory INI.3.5 The Request frameLike words in the Statement frame, these wordsfrequently occur with clausal Complements.However, because these Complements expressrequests rather that assertions, they often occuras bare stem clauses:(7) In all cases \[the respondent (Speaker, NP,Ext)\] may request \[in writing (Medium, PPin,Comp)\] \[that the disciplinary findings bepublished (Message, Sbrst, Comp)\].3.6 The Conversation flameOne class of words in the Communicationdomain does not use the FEs Speaker andAddressee as they occur in other frames.
Theseare nouns and verbs or reciprocalcommunication, which are treated in theConversation frame.
In this frame, the humaninterlocutors can be expressed in separateconstituents, assigned the roles Protagonist-I(Prot-1) and Protagonist-2 (Prot-2), or they canbe expressed in a single conjoined or pluralconstituent, assigned the role Protagonists(Prots).This class of words demonstrates thecomplex interaction of frames.
The FEs Prot-1,Prot-2 and Prots are not equivalent to any of theBasic Verbal Communication FEs, but do relateto them in a regular way.
Each of these rolesmust be thought of as relating to two or moreCommunicative subevents, and as correspondingto a Speaker in some and an Addressee in others.This basic structure is taken not from any framein the domain of Communication, but from aReciprocity frame, which is in the Generaldomain.
The Reciprocity frame may be thoughtof as an Aktionsart frame that structures eventsand relations from other frames in a particularway, such that there are multiple subeventualitiesof the same type as that of the input frame, andthe bindings or fillers of the roles are reversedfrom one subeventuality to the another.The complexity introduced by frames suchas these points to the need to distinguish betweenconceptual roles and FEs in any given frame.While the Communication roles Speaker andAddressee are not FEs in the Conversationframe, they are conceptual roles, because theconceptual representation f Conversation makesreference to them.
(In the Speaking framediscussed above, we can also think of theincorporated Message role as being a conceptualrole rather than an FE.)
FEs in any given frameshould therefore be defined as those roles forwhich the frame specifies conventional means ofsyntactic expression, even if these means are notemployed in all sentences.3.6.1 Disjoint expression: Prot-1 and Prot-2Here is a BNC example of argue with a disjointexpression of interlocutors:(8) "\[You (Prot-1, NP, Ext)\] can't argue\[politics (Topic, NP, Comp)\] \[with foreigners(Prot-2, PPwith, Comp)\]", sighed the policeman.Prot-2, the less prominent interlocutor, isregularly expressed in this frame by a PP Comp60headed by with.
This is consistent with thegeneral behavior of the Reciprocity frame as itoccurs in combination with other frames anddomains (e.g.
Pat had acollision/relationship/agreement with Kim).3.
6.2 Joint expression: ProtagonistsHere are BNC examples of the joint expressionof interlocuters with argue:(9) \[They (Prots, NP, Ext)\] argued \[angrily(Manner, AdvP, Mod)\] \[over who was the real"Prince of Sleaze" (Topic, PPover, Comp)\].
(10) \[Mr. and Mrs. Popple (Prots, NP, Ext)\]always argued \[INI (Topic)\] at least once aweek.3.7 FrameNet complements existing lexicalresourcesFrameNet annotations provide more detail thanexisting lexical resources about he way in whichparticular semantic roles (i.e.
FEs) are linkedwith particular means of syntactic expression.Since different senses of ambiguous words aredefined relative to different frames, this linkinginformation could potentially be used for lexicaldisambiguation.For example, consider the verb argue as it istreated in the WordNet database (Fellbaum1998).
Below are the three WordNet senses ofargue, and the sentence frames that areassociated with each sense:Sense 1: argue, reason - -  (present reasons andarguments)EX: Sam and Sue argueEX: Sam wants to argue with SueSense 2: argue, contend, debate, fence - -  (havean argument about something)EX: Sam and Sue argueEX; Sam wants to argue with SueSense 3: argue, indicate - -  (give evidence of;"The evidence argues for your claim"; "Theresults indicate the need for more work")The three senses listed above correspond to threedifferent frames: Sense 1 corresponds to theStatement frame, Sense 2 to the Conversationframe, and Sense 3 to the Evidence frame in theCognition domain.
However, the informationabout sentence frames provided in WordNetdoes not correspond to the generalizations thatare apparent in FrameNet.
For example,WordNet gives the same sentence frames forSenses 1 and 2, while in the FrameNet database,the senses of argue defined relative to theStatement and Conversation frames arecharacterized by different argument structures:only Statement argue allows finite clausalcomplements expressing Message; Conversationargue has the properties of other reciprocalcommunication words, which Statement arguelacks, and does not allow clausal Complements(or any other expression of Message).COMLEX (Meyers et al 1995) recognizesthe syntactic frames in which argue occurs, butdoes not provide information about he linking ofsyntactic constituents with semantic roles, orabout the different complementation propertiesof different senses of ambiguous words.ConclusionFrameNet semantic annotation captures humanknowledge about the ways in which semanticroles (FEs) are conventionally expressed bydifferent words in various word classes anddomains.
The kind of information in theFrameNet database is not expressed in the samelevel of depth in any existing print dictionary orcomputational lexical resource.
While WordNetdescribes emantic relations between words, itdoes not recognize the conceptual schemas, i.e.frames, that mediate in these relations, andtherefore does not have the means to linkarguments of predicating words with thesemantic roles they express.
COMLEX andNOMLEX provide detailed information aboutthe syntactic frames in which verbs and nounsoccur, but also lack a means to link syntacticarguments with semantic roles.
FrameNettherefore provides information that complementsmajor existing lexical resources.AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank the NationalScience Foundation for supporting this project,and the International Computer Science Institutein Berkeley for giving it a home.
