PATTERN MATCHING IN THE TEXTRACTINFORMATION EXTRACTION SYSTEMTsuyoshi Kitani t Yoshio \]:',riguchi t* Masami Ilara)*Center for Ma.chine TranslationCa.rnegie Mellon UniversityP i t tsburgh,  PA 15213AbstractIn information extraction systems, patternmarchers are widely used to identi~q infofmat|on of interest in a scntcncc.
In thispaper, pattern matching in the Tt :XTRACTinformation extraction system is described.It comprises a conccpt search which |dent|-tics key words representing a concept, and atemplate pattern search which identifies pat-terns of words and phrases.
TI'JXTI~,A(;Tusing thc matcher performed wcll in the:I'IPSTER/MUC-5 evahtation.
Thc patternmatching architecture is also suitable \]br rapidsystem development across different domainsof the same language.1 INTRODUCTIONIn information extraction systems, finite-state pattern matchers are becoming popularas a means of identifying individu~d pieces ofinformation in a sentence.
Pattern matchingsystems for English texts are reported to besuits,hie tor achieving a high level of per\[br-mance with less effort, compared to full pars-ing architectures\[Hobbs et al 92\].
Amongseventeen systems presented in the FifthMessage Understanding Conference (MUC-5),three systems used a pattern marcher a.s themain component for identifying patterns to beextracted \[MUC-5 93\].
A pattern matching ar-chitecture is appropriate for information ex-traction fi-om texts in narrow domains sinceidentifying informatkm does not necessarily re-quire full understa.nding of the text.
The pat-tern matcher can extract information of inter-tVisiting rese;trcher f on/ NTT Data Communica-tions Systems Corp., email: tkitani~.rd.nttdM.a.jpHNTT Data Communiclttions Systems Corp.est by locating speciIic expressions defined a.skey words and phrasal patterns obtained bycoq)us analysis.This paper describes a pattern matchingmethod that first identifies concepts in a seu-tence and then links critical pieces of informa-tion that map to a p~ttern.
The first step inpattern ln~tching is a concept searvh appliedin the TI ' ;XTRACT system of the T IPSTERJapanese microelectronics and corporate .jointventures domains{aacobs 93a\], \[aacobs 93b\].In this step, key words representing a conceptare searched for within a sentence.
The secondstep is a. template pattern sea~rh applied in theTEXTRACT joint ventures ystem.
A com-plex pattern to be searched for usually con-sists of a few words and phrases, inste~d of justone word, as in the concept search.
The tem-plate pattern search recognizes relationshipsbetween matched objects in the defined pat-tern a.s well a.s recognizing the.
concept itself.l,'rom the viewpoints of system perfofmance and portalfility across domains, theTIPS'I.
'I~;II/MUC-5 evaluatioll J'esults suggestthat pattern nta.tching described in this paperis all appropriate architecture for informationextraction from ,lapanese texts.2 TIPSTER/MUC-5 OVERVIEWThe goal of the TI1)STER/MUC-5 projectsponsored by ARPA is to capture informa-tion of interest from English and .lal)aJmsenewspal)er artMes about microelectronics andcorpora.re joint ventures.

The template is composed of severalobjects, each containing severM slots.
Slotsmay have pointers as va.lues, where pointerslink related ot)jects.
Extracted informationis expected to be stored in an object-orienteddatabase \[TIPSTER 92\].In the microelectronics domain, informationabout four specific processes in seiniconduc-tot manufacturing for microchip fabricationis captured.
They are layering, lithography,etching, aaM packaging processes.
\],ayering,lithography, and etching a.re wafer fa.brical:ionprocesses; packaging is part of tile last stage ofmanufacturing.
Entities such as manufactu rer,distributor, and user, in addition to detailedmanufacturing information such a.s materialsused and the microchip specifications such aswafer size and device speed are also extra.ctedin each process.The joint ventures domain focuses on extracting entities, i.e.
organizations, formingor dissolving joint venture relationshil)s. Theinformation to l)e extracted includes entity in-formation such as location, na.tionality, per-sonnel, and facilities, and joint venture infor-mation such as rela.tionshii)s, 1)usiness a.ctivi-ties, capital, and estimated revenue of the jointventttre.3 TEXTRACT ARCHITECTURETEXTI /ACT is an informati(m extractionsystem developed as an optiona.l system ofthe GE-CMU SHOGUN system \[Jacobs 93a\],\[aacobs93b\].

Details ofthe l)attern matching process are described inthe next section.The discourse processor links informationidentified a.t different stages o\[" processing.l"irst, implicit subjects, often use<\[ in Japanesesentences, are inherited fronl previous sen-tences, and set'oil(l, company ltatlles are givelliltliqlte ltunlbers necessary to accurately rec-ogMze company relationships throughout iletext\[Kitani 94\].
Concepts identified duringtile pattern matching process are used to se-lect an approt)ria.te string and filler' to go into ~slot.
\]?inally, l.he template generation pro(:essassembles the extracted information necessaryto creat(.~ the OUtl)nl; descril)ed in Secl, iou 2.10654 PATTERN MATCHING INTEXTRACT4.1 Concept searchKey words representing the same conceptare grouped into a list and used to recognizethe concept in a sentence.
The list is written ina simple format: (concept-name wordl word2...).
For example, key words tbr recognizing adissolved joint vent u re con cept can be writtenin the following way:(DISSOLVED ~-~j~-~ ~-.~: ~)or(DISSOLVED dissolve terminate cancel).The concept search module recognizes the con-cept when a word in the fist exists in tile sen-tence.
Using such a simple word list some-tilnes generates an incorrect concept.
For ex-ample, a dissolved concept is erroneously iden-tiffed fl'om an expression "cancel a hotel reser-vation".
IIowever, when processing text in a.narrow <lomain, concepts are often i<lentiffe<tcorrectly fi'om the simple list, since key wordsare usually used in a particular meaning of in-terest in the domain.During the Ja.panese segmentation processin the preprocessor, a key word in the texttends to be divided into a few separate wordsby MAJESTY, when the word is not storedin the dictionary, For example, the compoundnoun "~ j J '~f~"  consists of two words, " i~3 ''(joint venture) and ":r#~b1" (dissolve).
It is seg-mented into the two individual nouns using thecurrent MAJESTY dictionary.
Thus, whenthe compound word "~.-~jlf(t'-fb\] '' is searched forin the segmented sentence, the concept searchfails to identify it.
To avoid this segmentationproblein, adjacent nouns are automatical ly puttogether during the concept search process.This process al\]ows, by defanlt, partial wordmatching between a key word and a word inthe text.
Therefore, "~.-~j" and "~05 {~J"both meaning "a .joint venture" can be identi-tied by a single key word "~.'I~,Y'.
Ilowever,due to the nature of partial matching, thekey word "-.
:/~ = :/" (Silicon) matches "-iL~.4\[:: "5+ ~ = :/" (Silicon dioxide), which is a dif-ferent type of ffhn reported in the microelec-tronies domain.
This undesirable behavior canbe avoided by attaching ">" to the begin-ning or "<" to the end of key words.
Thus,,,> .3.1) :~ :/ <,, tells the matcher that it re-quires an exact word matching against a wordin the text.4.2 Template pattern search4.2.1 Template pattern matcherThe teml>late pattern matcher identifiestypical expressions to be extracted from thetext that frequently aplmar in the corpus.
Thepatterns are defined as pa.ttern matching rulesusing regular expressions.The pattern matcher is a ffnite-state au-tomaton sinfilar to the pattern recognizer use.din the MUC-4 FASTUS system developed atSRI \[I\[obbs et al 92\].

Thematcher identifies all possible patterns of in-terest in the.
text that match defined l>atterns.It must ignore unnecessary words in the pat-tern to perform successfifl pattern matchingfor various expressions.4.2.2 Pattern matching rulesFig.

2 Specilica.lly, a vari-able starting with "@CNAMI:;" is ca.lled theCOulpally-name varial)le, used where a com-pany nanm is exi)ected to apl)ear.
For exain-pie, "{}CNAME_I'AI{TNER_SUBJ" matchesany string that likely includes at least; one com-pany name acting a.s a joint venture partnerand functioning as a subject in tile sentence.The pattern "~ I h{:stri(:t:P" tells the pat-tern matcher to identify the word, where"~"  or "z)<" are grammatical  particles thatserve as sul)je(-t case markers.
The (te-fault type "strict" requires a.n exact stringmatch, whereas "loose" allows a partial stringmatch.
Partial string matching is usefulwhen compound words must be matched toa defined pattern.
A joint venture, "~.-~j:loose:VN", whose l>art of speech is verbal nom-inal, matches compound words such as "~..~~'~--~j" (corporate joint venture) a.s well ,%s "N~,j" (joint venture).2'\]'his \],'mglish pattern is used to capture xpressionssuch as "XYZ Corp. created ajoint venture with PQR1066(JointVenturel 6@CNAME_PARTNER_SUBJ~ \[ ~:strict:P@CNAME_PARTNERWITH:strict:P@SKIP~.-~:loose:VS)(a) A matching pattern for Japanese(JointVenturel 3@CNAME_PARTNER_SUBJcreate : :Va jo in t  venture :NPw i th : :P@CNAME_PARTNER_WITH)(b) A matching pattern for EnglishFig.

Several patterns usuallytllatch a. single sentence.
Moreover, siuce pal;-terns are often searched using case ma.rkersslic\]i as "~" ,  "7~<", and " ~ ", which frequentlyapt)ea.r ill .\]al)a.nese t xts, even a sitigie l)a.t -1;eri/ Call l \[ latch the  Sellt,ence ill n\]oi'e thrill Ollew{I,y whell  severa ,  I of" ti le same ca,se l l iarkers ex-ist ill a sentence.

Concepts are often useful tofill in the "set fill" (choice fi'om a. given set)sh)ts.

There axeca.ses when discourse processing is necessa.ryto link identified concepts and patterns.

3: FxamI)le of the inforntatiou extractionprocessthe company name "X" is also identitied bythe preprocessor, a Next, the concept "DIS-SOLVEi)" is recognized by the key word ter-minate in the concept search.
(The key wordlist is shown in Section 4.11.)
After sentence-level processing, discourse processing recog-nizes that "X" in the second sentence is a ref-erence to "X Inc." found in the first sentence.Thus, the "DISSOLVI';I)" concept is joined tothe, joint venture relationship between "X inc."and "Y Corp.".
in this way, TI!iXTRACT rec-ognizes that the two companies dissolved the,joint venture.SupI)ose that the second sentence is re-place(t with another sentence: "Shortly after,X terminated a contract to supply rice to ZCorp.".
Although it does not mentiot~ thedissolved relationship nor anything a hottt "YCorp.
", the system incorrectly recognizes thedissolved joint ventttre rela.tionship between"X In('."
and "V Corp." due to the existenceof the word terminate.
When this undesir-able matching is often seen, more complicatedtemplate patterns must be used instead of tilesimple word list.
A dissolved concept, lbr ex-ample, could he identified using the fo\]\[owingtemplate pattern:aWhen it is an unknown word to tim prepro(x~ssor,the discourse processor idcnti\[ies it IM.er.
(Dissolvedl 2OCNAMEPARTNER_SUBJdissolve I te rminate  l cancel::V@skipventure::N@CNAME_PARTNER_WITH).Then, discourse processing must check if com+panies identified in this pattern are the sameas the current joint venture comi)anies in orderto recognize their dissolved relationship.6 OVERALL  SYSTEM PERFOR-MANCEA total of 250 newspaper articles, 100about Japanese mi('roelectronics and 150about Japanese corl)orate joint ventureswere provided by ARI)A fl)r nse in theTll)SrI'FA/./MU(L5 system evalua.tion.

It is expected to work to other lan-guages with some minor modifications giventhat the input is segmented into primitivewords tagged with their parts of speech.The TEXTRACT Japanese microelectron-ics system was developed in only three weeksby one person.
In spite of its simplicity, itshowed the high performance.
This resultalso suggests that the pattern matching archi-tecture is highly portable across similar do-mains of the same la.nguage, thus facilitatingrapid system development.
Developing andmaintaining TEXTRACT's pattern matchingbased architecture is easier and less complexthan that of a full parsing system, as experi-enced in the early stage of StIOGUN systemdevelopment \[aacobs 93b\].Corpus analysis took about half of the de-velopment ime, since only a KWIC (KeyWord In Context) list and a word fi'equencytool were used to acquire the concept-wordlists and the template patterns.
Using goodstatistical corpus analysis tools will shortenthe development time and promise a high per-formance.
The tools should not only collectpatterns of interest with context, but also givestatistical data to show how well deft ned pat-terns are working when they are applied in thesystem.At MUC-5 meeting, P&R F-measure of oneof the top-ranking systems was claimed to beclose to the human perfornlance \[Jacobs 93b\].
rTo match the system performance of a patternmatching system to human performallce, thepreprocessor must recognize xpressions to beextracted at nearly 100% accuracy given thatother components imply merge informationand generate ontput.AcknowledgementsThe authors wish to express their apprecia-tion to aaime Carbonell, who provided the op-portunity to pursue this research a.t the Cen-ter for Machine Translation, Carnegie MellonUniversity.
