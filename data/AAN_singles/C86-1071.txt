The introduc-tion provides background, section 1 introduces thebasic ideas and the notation, and section 2 discussessome of the theoretical and practical implications ofthe model, including some concrete extensions, andsome more speculative discussion.As Kay (1985) has emphasised, machine translationtoday is always experimental in nature.
We think anumber" of things follow from this, among them theneed for clear and rather strong theoretical pr incip-les which can be treated as hypotheses for testing.The idea is, nf course, that such testing is revea-ling i rrespective of the confirmation or disconfirma-tion of the hypotheses.
Furthermore, especiallywhere projects of considerable size are concerned,clear and exp l i c i te ly  stated theoretical principlesare necessary for the ~ommoi2 understanding of theproblem.We assume that it is possible to distinguish a numberof different levels of description for MT theories(programmes, systems, etc), where in general, therelation between levels is that lower levels aremotivated, or evaluated with respect to higher le-vels.
The aim of this stratification is to introducea kind of modularity, so that it is possible topreserve stability while responding to changing per-ceptions of 'the MT problem'.
We distinguish the fo l -lowing levels of description:MuB: A set of executable programs, and descriptionsof a set of languages and the relations between them.Mul: A set of substantive theories of representation,and a set of languages in which linguistic descrip-tions are expressed.Me2: The basic theory of translat ion, general theoryof ( l inguist ic )  representation & computational appa-ratus.Mu3: The basic principles, aims, goals, characteris-tic assumptions, the 'spirit' of the enterprise.The purpose o~ the paper is to discuss the Mu2 level,concentrating on the basic theory or model of trans-lation.
Tbe approach will be to describe a family ofabstract, special purpose 'MT machines' by describingthe syntax and semantics of a very basic notation forMT.
We will make some assumptions about representa-tion and user languages for concreteness, but theywill be simplified, and unrealistic in the main.
Nextwe examine the model of translation by making expli-cit some of the theoretical commitments impl ic i t  inthe notation, discussing some i ts  attract ions,  andweaknesses, and sketching some possible remedies forthe la t te r .
Section 1 wi l l  present the notation,with some relevant background, section 2 wi l l  discussthe commitment he notation makes.L~_\[EE_EELEE\[_!,odel of t rans la t ion .The ideas described in th is  section were f i r s t  pre-sented at the the Colgate Conference on Methodologi-cal Issues in MT (Arnold et al  Des Tombe et al1985).
A key idea in what follows is an interpreta-tion of the idea that translation is a 'compositio-nal' process.
To our knowledge, the f i r s t  applica-tion of this  idea in MT is in the work of Jan Lands-bergen in the Rosetta project (of Landsbergen 19B4).The fundamental problem of MT is to find a notation,with an associated interpreter ,  for describing thetranslation relations between texts in d i f ferentlanguages in a 'natural' way.
Since i t  seems impos-sible to provide such a notation for relating textsto texts directly, the standard response is to decom-pose the problem 'hor izonta l ly '  into a sequence ofsteps, as in :(I) TL G - - -  RL I ~~- RL 2 - - -  RL 3 .
.
.
RL n .... TL Twhere TLs and TLT are source and target text lan-guages, and the RL i are representat ion  languages (orlevels of representation, as they are often called)of some sort.
(Notice that in what follows me wil lsystematically use the term 'language' ambiguouslyfor both natural languages and representation lan-guages).
Giw!n such a picture one natural ly thinksof the languages that are input and output of trans-fer, but far the purpose of this  discussion theycould be any pair of representation languages atall.
What is crucial to this discussion is the as-sumption that MT characteristically involves morethan one representation language.
This point is worthstressing.
The following discussion will be couchedin terms of a representational theory (Mull thatinvolves several specific levels of representation.We believe that this is motivated, but the interestof the general model in no way depends on the ex-istence of these levels.Given this ,  one is obviously lead to consider (a) thenature of the representation languages, and (b) thenature of the relations between the representationlanguages themselves, and between the representationlanguages and the text languages.We wi l l  not  d iscuss  the nature  of the representat ionlanguages here in any detail  (see Arnold et al#anuary 1985, for detailed discussion), hut i t  seemsimportant that they should he:297(i) DifLe\[eE~atin~L: This is required i f  the systemis to preserve whatever properties are preservedunder" 'correct t rans la t ion ' .
I f  two (unambiguous)texts are not translation equivalents i.e.
if theydiffer ~ith respect to these properties, then therepresentation languages must be rich enough to pro-v ide  different representations fo r  them.
( i i )  Learnab le  (speci f ic  and indepmndently def i -nable): By 'learnable' we mean simply that it must bepossible fat" linguists (who eust  state the relationsbetween a language and its neighbeurs, ultimately inthe farm of an executable description) to be able tounderstand that relation: for any given text theyshould be able to determine the appropriate repre-sentation, and vice versa: the intuitive semantics ofthe representation language should be accessible tothem.
This normally means that the representationaltheory should be rather specific and constrained.
Italso means that an independent specification of thelanguage should be available.
To take the most pro-blematic case, consider the writer of the generationcomponent in a multilingual MT system, where the onlydefinition of the input representation language isthat provided by the transfer components themselves.The task seems clearly impossible.
(iii) ~E_EELE~E~_E;  Tb is  is the  most straightfor-ward, and the most commonly appealed to requirementfor the adequacy of representation languages.
Itmust at least be easier to relate the representationlanguages than it is to relate the text languages.It is this requirement that usually rules out naturallenguages (e.g.
Latin) as representation languages,and motivates representation languages which arehighly structured.We will not be concerned oith particular representa-tion languages that have been proposed in Eorotrabut, for the purposes o{ exposition, it is worth abrief description of the ~ind of representation lan-guages (levels) we will assume in what .follows.
Wewi l l  assume there are three such languages (apartf rom leve ls  such as actual, and normalized text):(a) A surface constituent/morphological structurelevel of a rather standard kind, allowing more thanone x-bar projection of the major lexical categories(see Arno ld  et al ~anuary  1985) .
This level isusually called ECS (Eurotra Constituent Structure).
(b) fi level which represents syntactic relations ordependency, and information about syntactic category.This level involves structures where each (non-co-ordinate) construction contains a primitive itemwhich is the head, or governor ( 'gov ' )  of the otherelements of the construction (this amounts to a sti-pulation that there can be no more than one projec-tion of lexical categories: X I syntax, in effect).Th is  level is usually called ERS (Eurotra RelationalSt ructure) .
(c) A level which represents semantic relations/de-pendency, and thus contains an indication of semanticrelations (case or :beta roles).
Like the syntacticrelational level, we will take this to be an X Ilevel, it is intended to abstract away f rom surfacesyntactic phenomena that are net relevant to transla-tion, and to re-interpret some syntactic characteris-tics semantically (egg.
replacing tense marking by anindication of time reference).
This level is normally298called Interface Structure (18), since it provides aninterface between analysis and transfer, and transferand generatinn components?Turning now to the relations between ttlese languages,as regards the text<->representation language rola-tion, there is very little to say in an HT contextthat does not arise elsewhere in computational lin-guistics, where pars ing  and generat ion  are  two of  themajor areas of research.
It is the relation betweenthe representation languages that concerns MT speci-fically.
We think the falloeiog three conditions areimportant:(i) compositimnal ity(ii) directness (primitiveness, 'one-shut-ness')(iii) simplicity (statable in a ~imple way)Idioms apart, the translation of complex expressionsis normally based in some systematic may on thetranslations of their parts -- normal translation isin some sense 'co,n~ositiona\['.
Of course, i t  is onlybecause of this that the translation relation isproductive at all, and if one is looking for" princip-les, it seems reasonable to require something likethis of  the relation between the  representationallanguages also.
\]'he following gives a slightly moreprecise sense to th i s  idea:Translation is compositional when the translationof a complex expression is some (reasonablystraightforward) function of the translation o-I thebasic expressions it contains, plus the translationof their mode of combination.Condition ( i i )  'directness' of- 'primitiw~ness' issimply intended to exclude illicit representationallevels between those officially sanctioned: what itsays is that the RLi -RL  j relation must he direct, orprimitive, and cannot  he mediated by other undec la redrepresentational levels.
Such a conditimn helps tomaintain clarity (and learnability), and giw-~s con-tent to the other conditions.A more ferea\] reconstruction of these ideas (alongthe lines suggested in Hontague (1974)) eight be asfollows.We begin by defining compositional translation as arelation between 'g rammars '  (generative dev ices )specifying languages, rather than languages directly,thus making the RLi-RL J relationship parasitic on therelation between tbe  cor respond ing  'grammars'.
In-stead of (I), we are thinking of a picture like (2),where a 'vertical' dimension has been added(2) B 1 .

TL fCompositional translation of two representation l an -guages RL i and RLj is then defined by a pair ofrelations T and T -i ('translators') between the 6 iand 8j (generat ive  devices, grammars) specifying(generating, enumerating) RL i and RLj.We take a generative device 8 to be a pair, <C,I\]>where C is a finite set of constructors ('rules'defining the class of complex expressions), andA is a finite set of atoms (basic expressions).We say that translation from L i to Lj is ELE_LEt~Y.
?omL0ositional if tilere is mapping T from 6i=<Ci,Ai>to 8j=<Cj,Aj> such that:(i) T leaps A i into Aj, and( i i )  there is a mapping t from C i into Cj suchthat if u = <c : u1,...,Un> ,then T(u) = <tc | T (U l ) , .
, .
, T (Un) )As will become apparent, these definitions imply avery res t r i c Jve  theory  of translation, one which ismuch too strtlog to be usable.
However', before dis-cussing its inadequacy, we mill make the ideas invol-ved more concrete by describing a notation for Gs andTs mhich is strongly committed to these ideas, andby discussing a very simple example of the use of thenotation, fhe description is rough and not preciselyformalised, bmt should give an idea of the issuesinvolved.Notation for constructors and atoms:atom ::= (name, feature description)constructor::= (name,feature description)\[argspec*\]argspec::= (name, feature description)(In fact, atoms are simply constructors with ar i ty ~,but we will preserve the intuitive distinction here).The feature theory we assume here is extremelysimple: a feature description is a set of attribute-va lue  pa i rs .
fhe ' name'  i s  .
just  a d is t ingu ished  fea -tu re  represent ing  the  in tu i t i ve  l ingu is t i c  bas i s  ofthe language being described (thus, it might be asyntactic category, a syntactic relation, or a seman-tic relation as appropriate).
Notice that  this nameneed not be unique.
Each const ructor  has in additiona unique abbreviatory const ructor  name which is usedby the T-rules.The language I_ generated by a G is a set of well-formed object (wfo's) such that:Every atom i s  a mfo; and i f  c n is a const ructorof arity n, and each of el, .
.
.
,  U n is a wfo,then c n : Ul, ..., u n is a wfo.This very simple syntax for Gs will lead to over'-"generation .... for + example, it mill allow np const ruc -to rs  wi th  two arguments as a wfo, even i f  the f i r s targument is a verb,  and the second is a prepos i t ion .For this reason we supplement the purely syntacticdescription uith a semantics based on applying con-structors to arguments.
We will thus normally beconcerned only with the subset mfos that are alsoconstructs~ in the following sense:Every atom i~i a construct~ a const ructor  applied k~some argumellt~i yields a const ruct  providing the argu'-ments EEL~_~ with the appropr ia te  argspecs of th~constructor.Examples (for' a constituent structure language):atom~: aexampl e = (example, {cat=n, oum=sing})athi~ ~ ,~: ( th i s ,  {cat=det ,  oum=sing})const ructor :Cop= (no, {num=X, per=3}) \[( , {cat=det ,  num=X})( , {cat=n,  num=X})\]const ruct  Cnp: athis aexampl e =(np, {num=siog, per=5})\[(this, {cat=dmt, num=sing}),(e?ample, {cat=o, num=sing})lThe syntax and semantics of fs  i s  rough ly  as fo l loms.Syntactically v a T-rule is of the form: lhs ==> rhs,where ihs and rhs are atoms or constructors of sourceand target language Gs respectively.
For example, thefollowing might be T-rules relating a level based onsyntactic relations with one based on semantic rela-tions for the atoms corresponding to the verbs likeand !kit.
(They are both assumed to assign subject andobject relations to their dependents syntactically.They are assumed to assign respectively, experiencerand patient, and agent and patient to their semanticdependents?
Since the loading linguistic idea atboth levels is relational, and the nature of therelation cannot be determined for constructs in iso-lation, the name feature  of atoms and const ructors  i s'blank' at these levels).

i  OnThis syntax and semantics for T~rules implements theidea of strict compositiooality defined above.This model is elegant, but inadequate, givml the waynatural languages appear to be.
What s t r i c t  composi-tionality requires is at least a rather strong homo-morphism between the languages related by a T. It iseasy to find examples where this looks implausible.For example, consider the common need to re-ordermembers of a construction in translation~ or the needto ~liminate 'formal' items which are a part ofconstructions in one language (one level) but not inanother (perhaps re-expressing some information theycarry as part of a feature), as in (6); or the kindof simple s t roc tmra l  change i nwHved in going from alevel which has both 5 and VP constructions to onemhich has verb, subject, and object as members of asingle construction (7); or' the need to re-analyse anitem which is part of nee constraction in one lan-guage, as part of another construction in translation(8).

Notice that though,299for simplicity, we have chosen examples that areclose to the surface of one language (English), thereare many examples of this  kind between languages:(9) \ [ jules zwemt graag\] ==>\[julesi l kes\ [e i  to swim\]\]"jules swims l i k ing ly '(10} \[give\[a hand to X\]\] ==> \[(helpen { }),X\](11) \[n apple se l ler \ ]  ==> \[np vendeur \[pp de pommes\]\]'Lexical holes" such as English exhibits with respectto Dutch (English has no adverb ' l i k ing ly"  to trans-late rag_raacL) , and idioms such as qive.a hand wi l lnormally give rise to the need for non-st r ic t ly  com-positional translations, for obvious reasons.
As amore general example, it is often the case that whatis expressed I ex ica l ly  or syntactically in one lan-guage is expressed morphologically in another .Thus, modality is often expressed by inflection inRomance languages, and by combinations of separatelexi~al items in Germanic languages, and correspon-dences between compounds in Germanic languages, andsyntactic constructions in Romance languages (as in(11}) are very common.
Treating this  kind of thingwill certainly lead to non-strictly compositionaltranslations somewhere.The solution to th is  problem adopted by Landsbergen(1984) in Rosetta is to 'tune' the Gs to each other,thereby ensuring that they are homomorphic, and thatsomething close to s t r i c t  compositionality can bepreserved.
(In fact,  Landsbergen requires the trans-lat ion relation to be symmetric, so the grammars turnout to be isomorphic).
This preserves  the eleganceof the model, but at the expense of the elegance ofthe l ingu is t ic  theories and descriptions (the Mul andMUD), which become extremely complex, and potent ia l lyunusable .
For example, i t  requires give a hand t Eand ~ ,  and ~ ,  and like to to be treatedalike.
Providing a systematic and general character-isation of a theory  of representation which allowsthis seems h igh ly  problematic.
What one expects isthat the representational theory wi l l  become unlearn-able in the sense described above.
A second objec-tion to this  approach is the obvious one that i teliminates the modularity that is potentially avail-able with this model (each G can be thought of as amodule, e.g . )
.
This reduces its attractiveness froma deve lopmenta l  point of view, particularly wheremulti - l ingual MT involving large numbers of lan-guages, or wide coverage (hence collaboration ofl a rge  numbers of ind iv idua ls )  i s  env isaged.For these reasons, we have preferred to explore anal ternat ive approach, which involves allowing somerelaxations of s t r i c t  compositionality.
The fo l -lowing th ree  relaxations have been proposed :(i) To allow variables on either side of T rules :(12) e.g.
c27 \[ I ,  2, 3 \] ==> c38 \[ 2, 3 \]with the meaning: translate any expression formed byapplying c27 to th ree  arguments by an expressionformed by applying c38 to the translation of thesecond and third arguments.
This relaxation allowsfor re-orderings, deletions, and reduplications by T-rules, and seems an entirely natural extension ofs t r i c t  compositienality.
( i i )  To allow functions made up of constructors,atoms, and variables of the appropriate Gs on either300side of T-rules, e.g.
(13} e.g.
c S \ [ I ,  Cvp \[2, 3\]\] ==> Csubj/obj \[2, I ,  3\]Notice that since the output of such a translationrule is s t i l l  an expression in the target language( i .e .
an expression bui l t  by applying target G con-structors to target constructs), th is  relaxationstill yields 'one shot' translation.
(iii) To allmw the choice of the target constructor(function) to be dependent on properties of the argu-ments involved.
For example, one does not want a l l\[v ppl constructions to be treated l ike rel__el_y~_.gn_ in(8), and the exceptional translation behaviour ofidioms, and constructions involving lexical holes isclearly dependent on the presence of particular pro-perties within constructions (e.g.
the presence ofparticular lexical items):(14) e.g.
c35 \[1, 21f l=vt,  3\] ==> c46 \ [ i ,  2, 31f2=v2\]with the meaning: translate constructions formed byapplying c35 to three arguments by constructionsformed by applying c46 to their  translations, provi-ding the second argument of c35 unif ies with a fea-ture description where the attribute fl has the valuevl, and the translation of the third argument unifieswith a feature description where the at t r ibute  f2 hasthe value v2.Though there is no provision for wild notationaldev ices  such as path variables, these relaxationsgreatly increase the power of the notation, to anextent which is problematic, given our methodology.We would naturally like to impose restrictions, sothat we can preserve the idea that in compositionaltranslation the translation of a whole is some 'rea-sonably straightforward' function of the translationof i ts  parts.
One poss ib i l i ty  is to impose specialrestr ict ions (or a l ternat ive ly  res t r i c t  some relaxa-tions) to certain translators (e.g.
one would likethe transfer translators to be as near as possiblerestricted to some kind of atom-atom translator) .More generally, one might require that at most oneside of a T-rule be a function (in the sense ofrelaxation (b l ) ,  or to require that context sensitiveT-rules may only refer to attr ibutes of particulararguments (e.g.
attr ibutes of the heads of construc utions, perhaps, or to only allow them to test for thepresence of particular lexical items among theirarguments).
There are interesting methodological andempirical problems involved in trying to find approp-riate restrictions, but we will not pursue them here,since (as will appear in the following section), thenotation is s t i l l  res t r i c t ive  enough for there to bea theoretical commitment which d~serves discussion.2.
The theoretical commitments of the model.The attractiveness of our model as a framework forpractical and theoretical MT derives from i ts  modula-r i ty  and i ts  orderliness in the main .
Pract ical ly ,i t  ensures that translation proceeds via a series ofrepresentations which are described exp l i c i t l y ,  andwhich there fore  have to be capable of systematicdescription, and it ensures that the language gene-rated by app ly ing  a sequence of translators is alwaysa subset of a language that has been exp l i c i t l ydescribed.
It thus comes as close as possible toexcluding 'hybrid' representations, and ensuring thatrepresentations languages will be 'learnable'.
More-over, the separation of Gs and Ts~ and the use of asemantics based on unification provides a high degreeof declarativeness, and the homogeneity and uniformi-ty of the model may be of practical benefit.
Theseparation of Gs and Ts also provides a high degreeof modularity, so, e.g.
di f ferent  Gs can in principlebe developed in parallel, and the effects of modifi-cations may often be localised to one G and theadjacent Ts.
This is developmentally at t ract ive.Methodologically and theoret ical ly  the model is at-t ract ive in a number of ways.
The complexity of T-rules provides a very simple and effect ive evaluationmetric against which to judge competing proposalsabout representational levels (so it is relativelyeasy to find arguments why there  should or should notbe intermediate representations of a certain sort).And it provides a level of abstraction at wbichlinguists and implementers can communicate easily.However, perhaps the most important advantage of themodel is that it decomposes the 'problem of MT', andprovides a framework for investigating some interes-ting and apparently manageable sub-problems.
Someof these are discussed in a pre l iminary  way here.This notation, and hence the model that i t  instan-tiates, in effect provides a context free grammarnotation augmented by a simple feature theory basedon unification, and (via the T rules) tbe capacityfor cer ta in  transformations.
We have no demonstra-tion of the weak genenerative capacity of the nota-t ion, but one suspects i t  Js at least as powerful asthe notations of LF6 (Kaplan & Bresnan 1982), or rUG(Kay 19857.
Taking fu l l  advantage of re laxat ions(a)-(c) below may well yield Turing machine capacity.While this makes i t  l i ke ly  that the notation providessome treatmeot of al l  t rans lat ional ly  relevant pheno-mena, it i!i still rather restricted as regards des-criptive or expressive capacity, and there is noguarantee that the treatment will be 'natural', ap-propriate, or even practically usable.One approach to the issue of usability is the provi-sion of user" friendly abbreviations (e.g.
)~ and it isfairly easy to imagine some conventions which wouldtake this hasic (Mu2) notation and make i t  moreusable as a programming language for linguists (i.e.a Mul 'user  language ' ) .Some of the major modifications to the model whichhave been proposed include:(a) The introduction of special versions of construc-tor application in place of unification, for example,in the treatment of co-ordinate constructions.
Theproperties of co-ordinate constructions are partlydetermined by the fact that they inherit  the commonfeatures  of the i r  e lements,  so the feature  descr ip -t ion  of the ~:onstruction should be the generalisation(roughly self consistent intersection of the featuredescriptions) of the elements, rather than theiruni f icat ion.
(b) The introduction of Kleene star to avoid deeplyrecursive structures in the treatment of construc~times which allow arbitrary numbers of arguments(e.g.
most constructions can include an indef in i te lylarge number of PP modifiers).
Since the syntax of6s requ i res  specific reference to the arity of con-strutters ,  the obvious may of dealing with this  phe ~nomena in the basic notat ion  i s  to have recurs iveconstructors (e.g.
a constructor that combines an npand a pp to form an np)~ yielding structures such as:(iS) npnp ppnp ppnp ppThis treatment is not obviously incorrect, but it isnot necessarily the most in tu i t ive ly  sat isfactorytreatment either, and i t  can have the undesriableeffect of burying the lexical heads of constructionsarb i t ra r i l y  fa r  down ins ide  them.
(c) A closely related point is that the model des-cribed is committed to representation languages wheremembers of const ruct ions  are s t r i c t ly  ordered ( \ [c32:a ,b \ ]  is a d i f fe rent  ob jec t  from \[c32: b,a \ ]  - -  e.g.the la t ter  may fa i l  to unify to give aconstruct,while the former succeeds).
This may not always bevery natural, especially where relat ional  languagesare concerned: since the elements of constructionsare distinguished by their roles, they do not alsoneed to be distinguished positionally.A number of modifications along these lines are heingdiscussed in the project.
They are not onproblematic(or even obviously correct), for example, (b) and (c)above both suggest that constructors be treated asoperations on sets, rather than lists of arguments.Apart from changing the formal nature of construc-tors, a problem will arise in going from unorderedrepresentation languages to ones which are ordered,motivating an extension to the T-rule notation.
Ne-vertheless, they seem to within a reasonable distanceof (and hence compatible with) the essentials of thebasic model.A consequence of the CFG basis of the model is thatconstructs are always hierarchical objects similar totree structures (each application of a constructoryields a new l eve l  of structure, in tu i t ive ly ) .
Themodel is most naturally applied in the description oflinguistic phenomena that can be thought of hierar-chically, and in translating between languages thatcapture such phenomena.
Thus, i t  is natural ly ap-plied in the description of phrase and relat ionalstructures (though cf above), and given the uni f ica-tion based semantics, in dealing with phenomena suchas agreement between members of constructions.Moreover, though the 'naturalness' of the treatmentis perhaps more questionable, it provides interes-ting, and apparently workable accounts of a number ofphenomena that are not obviously hierarchical.
Forexample: i t  is reasonably easy to see hem the relaxa-tions of s t r i c t  colapositionality allow a treatment offunctional control and unbounded syntactic dependen-cies (Arnold et al  1985 sketches a crude~ butstraightforward treatment exploit ing the poss ib i l i tyof having functions composed of target 6 constructorsand var iab les  in T~ru les ) .301One cart also envisage a treatment of  pronominal refe-rence (which is naturally thought of in terms of cn-indexation across trees, rather than in hierarchicalterms) within this model along the following lines.Suppose every construct is assigned a unique index,and every non-atomic construct is augmented by twolists (which we wi l l  refer to jo in t ly  as the alalists):(i) an antecedent list, of the indices of the paten-tial antecedents the construct contains;(it) an an_o~phor list, of the indices nf thepotentially anaphoric items the construct contains.We will say that a member of the antecedent list anda member of the anaphor list are 'compatible' provi-ding they do not differ with respect to the relevanti nherent  linguistic properties (such as number andgender).
Every time a constructor is applied to somearguments, the a/a lists of the arguments are inspec-ted:(i) if two arguments have compatible items on theirlists, then art indication that these two items arebound to each other is added to the construct thatresults;(it) the indices of the arguments, and members of thearguments '  a la  l i s t s  a re  used to  form the  re levanta la  lists of the construct.Apart from testing for inherent properties of antece-dents  and anapbors, structural conditions can beimposed, e .g .
the c-command condition can be imposedby allowing members of antecedent lists to be trams--lured 'upwards' tn only one construct.
This seemsto provide a basic method for expressing all theantecedent-anaphor relations, in so far as they aregrammatically determined, at least.It is a natural consequence of the CFG basis of thenotation that, under" this treatment of antecedemt-anaphor  relations, objects do not themselves containan indication of their antecedents (or  anaphors).Instead, this information is present in the constructthat contains them.
For the same reasons, the  nota-tion involves an interesting commitment in some kindsof context senstive translation.Consider, for example, the translation of the verbknow into French, which (for simplicity) we wi l l  taketo be ~avoir if there is a semtential complement, andconnaitre if there is a nominal complement, i.e.
ins tandard  rewrite notation:(16) a. know -> cunnaitre I _ np-objb.
know -> savoir I__ s-objOur notation has no direct analogue to this sort ofstatement: t i re  contex~ sensitivity has to be takencare of in the translation of the construction con-taining the verb.
Suppose c32 is the English con-structor which builds the IS representation of Oulesknows S v and suppose that English-French transfercontains the following T- ru les :(17) a. know ==> connaitreb.
know ==> savoirc.
c32 ==> of 36Then c32:  know, Jules, S wi l l  produce both of:(18) (4) Cf~6: connaitre Oules  S'302(ii) cf36: savoir Jules S'and what one expects is that unif ication in (i) (orsome later translation of ( i ) )  will fail to produce aconetruct (e.g, because of 36 checks the Syntacticcategory of its third argument).
This seems a verynatural account for cases such as these, where thetarget G contains the information for making theright cho ice ,  But one cannot expect this always to beso (e.g.
where the information required is only partof the source language), and in such cases contextsensitive T-rules will be required (of relaxation (c)above) .
It is clear that this notation is committedto such cases being less common, at least.As already noted, this model provides for a highdegree of modularity in principle.
In fact, thedegree of modularity is rather extreme: not only areindividual Gs modules, but individual constructorsand atoms are  modules also.
Though the  use of afeature theory allows some general)motions to becaptured, the degree of modularity means that manygeneralisations that hold 'horizontally' (across lan-guages), and ' ve r t i ca l l y '  (within languagesl aremissed.The most obvious case of horizontal generalisationsare 'invariances' and default translations acrosslanguages.
For example, one does not expect theva lue  of  the  attribute which identifies individuallexical items to change normally during analysis andgeneration, and the simplest and most restrictiveview of transfer would be that nnly this attributechanges.
Similarly, one knows that syntactic sub-jects normally correspond to semantic agents, andvice versa.Within individual languages some capacity to capturegeneralisations across constructors is a prerequisiteof some of the modifications mentioned above (inparticular, CF type treatments of unbounded dependen-cies depend on some such mechanism if massive redun-dancy is to be avoided).
More generally, one wouldlike to be able to state conventions (about e.g.
thepercolation of attributes from heads of cnnstructionsto constructions) once and for all, rather than ha.-ring to state them separately in each constructor,and there are various defaults which could make con-struction of Gs easier (e.g.
the default case is thatverbs  have regu lar  morpho logy) .Here we will briefly describe a fairly simple exten-sion of the basic notation which is capable of dea-ling with these phenomena: ~E~ect~_EE__EuleE I whichdescribe (relations betweenl classes of constructs bystating part ial  descriptions of (pairs of) con-structs.
The following are examples:(19>(20)(21)(_, {cat=v, morph-form=regulat })( , {cat=X, ...})l (gov, {cat=X, o..})(_, {cat=s, tense=vl}) \[3 ==>(_, {time=v2}) \ [ \ ]The idea being that such rules can be used to ' in -ject" generalisations into existing constructors,atoms, or \[-rules.
The normal problem with such'meta" devices as these is controlling their interac-tion.
A very simple way of avoiding this would be toadopt the following semantics: applying an injectionrule l to a rule (atom, constructor, or T-rule) Rsucceeds if I unifies with R, in which  case theun i f i ca t ion  EgEl(;c~s R. Th is  semant ics  means thatinjection rules cannot affect the cardimality t~f therole set, but it greatly simplifies the form andumntent nf the ru les  that  must be wr i t ten ,  and pro-v ides  a perspicnous way of otat iug  cer ta in  general J .
- -sa t ions .As stated, injection rule (19) is intended to unifymiLh a l l  atmms that haw~, cat=v, and to add in thei n fo rmat ion  that  they have regu lar  morphology.
No.-l i ce  that  th i s  in jec t ion  rul~., w i l l  fail to app ly  tuany atom that  a l ready  has it d i f fe rent  spec i f i ca t ionfo r  morph-forla,  so there  is a ~.
;traightformard way oftrnatiug exceptions ouch as irregular verb morpholo-gy, (20) is a vpry simple example of a percolationinjection.
When applied to the coustructors of arelational l eve l  f;, it will ensure that  the categoryof the head (gov) of a construct, is percolated to tlloconst ruct ion?

(21) is intended to state acer respoudenee between tense=v l ,  and t ime=v2,  aridwill i n jec t  th i s  relation!~hip into a l l  T-Pu les  thattranslate seotences~It is appropriate to end by mentioning the mestobvious open questions, since they suggest the direc-T:ion which future work should take.
(i) We have not yet investigated tlm implications ofthe model for robustness, arid while the model hasbeen set up uo that  T-rules should he reversible to al a rge  extent~ we have i nsu f f i c ient  practical ex-perience wit l l  it to know how far this potential canhe explo i ted.
.
( i t )  Perhaps the most obv iuos  theoretical commitmentis that the notation is linguistic \]u nature, He-signed for representing linguistic knowledge (itwould not be a very natural method fo r  representingmore general ' rea l  world' knowledge).
We think thisis appropriate in HT, which is fundamentally aboutrelating l.i_ttt~lEi_stic objects.
However, as many exam-ples indicate, there is an important role for gener~ilknowledge in HT, and this must be accommodated some-where.?
No doubt var ious  compromises are possihle~antl there is certainly room in the model fur s~chquasi-linguistic entities as semaotic features, buttaking the model serioosly involves rejecting know-ledge representation languages as levels per so.
Thero le  of general  knowledge representat iens  cannottherefore be a step in translation, and can only  beto provide a method of chmosing between alternativerepresentations at linguistic levels.
(iii) \]his leads directly to another  point: theframework provides a number nf mayo of coping withnun-determinism (filtering hy target Gs, contextsensitive T--rules, e.g.
), but there is no method furthe explicit comlJarisun of competing representations(e .g .
as in ' p re ference  semantics' Milks ( tP" lB)) ,  andto prov ide  such a method seetas heyond the scope ofthe model we have described.
Practically~ it is notclear whether thi,.i is a problem or not, however~ anappruach which is censistent mith the general spirito~ the model might he to define a cumber of 'choice'levels, at which ~:bmices between alternatives wouldbe made (tS is the obvious candidate), fie wouldrequire G and T rules tu be set up se that all alter-native representations at these levels would hetranslatimn~lly equivalent~ uo that choice could bearbitrary.
( i v )  We have assumed an extremely simple featuretheory (e.g.
~'ae have not allowed attribute~ to takefeatures as values).
It is clear that a more sophis-ticated theory is desirable~ and ~ome work has beendmee in this direction witllin the  model?
llomever~what is not clear is how the extra descriptive paperof an extended feature theory  affects the 'pragma-t i cs '  of l.he model .... the  way the model should beused fo r  l i ngu is t i c  descr ip t ion .Investigation mf this model is still at an {:artys tage~ and much of the abowe i s  specu la t ive  mr sche-matic.
However, desp i te  i t s  p re l iminary  !
;taLus, wefeel the  approach  described here i5 pr ( Imis iug ,  alto wehmpe we have said enuugh to show why ~e feel it isworthy of attention.More information on the Eurot ra  project can be foundin e.g.
