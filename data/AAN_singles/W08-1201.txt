Coling 2008: Proceedings of the workshop on Human Judgements in Computational Linguistics, page 1Manchester, August 2008The Relevance of a Cognitive Model of the MentalLexicon to Automatic Word Sense DisambiguationMartha Palmer and Susan BrownUniversity of Colorado at BoulderDepartment of LinguisticsHellems 290, 295 UCBBoulder, CO 80309-0295, USASupervised word sense disambiguation requires training corpora that have been tagged with word senses,and these word senses typically come from a pre-existing sense inventory.
Space limitations imposed bydictionary publishers have biased the field towards lists of discrete senses for an individual lexeme.Although some dictionaries use hierarchical entries to emphasize relations between senses, many do not.WordNet, which has been the default choice of NLP researchers for sense tagging because of its broadcoverage and easy accibility, does not have hierarchical entries.
Could the relations between senses thatare captured by a hierarchy be useful to NLP systems?
Concerns have also been raised about whether ornot WordNet?s word senses are unnecessarily fine-grained.
WSD systems are obviously more successfulin distinguishing coarse-grained senses than fine-grained ones (Navigli, 2006), but important informationcould be lost if fine-grained distinctions are ignored.
Recent psycholinguistic evidence seems to indicatethat closely related word senses may be represented in the mental lexicon much like a single sense,whereas distantly related senses may be represented more like discrete entities (Brown, 2008).
Theseresults suggest that, for the purposes of WSD, closely related word senses can be clustered together intoa more general sense with little meaning loss.
This talk will describe this psycholinguistic research andits current implications for automatic word sense disambiguation, as well as plans for future research andits possible impact.c?
