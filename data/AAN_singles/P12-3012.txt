a wide-coveragemultilingual lexical knowledge base ?
andmultilingual knowledge-rich Word Sense Dis-ambiguation (WSD).
Our aim is to provide theresearch community with easy-to-use tools toperform multilingual lexical semantic analysisand foster further research in this direction.1 IntroductionIn recent years research in Natural Language Pro-cessing (NLP) has been steadily moving towardsmultilingual processing: the availability of evergrowing amounts of text in different languages, infact, has been a major driving force behind re-search on multilingual approaches, from morpho-syntactic (Das and Petrov, 2011) and syntactico-semantic (Peirsman and Pado?, 2010) phenomena tohigh-end tasks like textual entailment (Mehdad etal., 2011) and sentiment analysis (Lu et al, 2011).These research trends would seem to indicate thetime is ripe for developing methods capable of per-forming semantic analysis of texts written in anylanguage: however, this objective is still far from be-ing attained, as is demonstrated by research in a corelanguage understanding task such as Word SenseDisambiguation (Navigli, 2009, WSD) continuing tobe focused primarily on English.
While the lack ofresources has hampered the development of effec-tive multilingual approaches to WSD, recently thisidea has been revamped with the organization ofSemEval tasks on cross-lingual WSD (Lefever andHoste, 2010) and cross-lingual lexical substitution(Mihalcea et al, 2010).
In addition, new research onthe topic has explored the translation of sentencesinto many languages (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010;Lefever et al, 2011; Banea and Mihalcea, 2011),as well as the projection of monolingual knowledgeonto another language (Khapra et al, 2011).In our research we focus on knowledge-basedmethods and tools for multilingual WSD, sinceknowledge-rich WSD has been shown to achievehigh performance across domains (Agirre et al,2009; Navigli et al, 2011) and to compete with su-pervised methods on a variety of lexical disambigua-tion tasks (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010).
Our vi-sion of knowledge-rich multilingual WSD requirestwo fundamental components: first, a wide-coveragemultilingual lexical knowledge base; second, toolsto effectively query, retrieve and exploit its informa-tion for disambiguation.
Nevertheless, to date, nointegrated resources and tools exist that are freelyavailable to the research community on a multi-lingual scale.
Previous endeavors are either notfreely available (EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998)), orare only accessible via a Web interface (cf.
the Mul-tilingual Research Repository (Atserias et al, 2004)and MENTA (de Melo and Weikum, 2010)), thusproviding no programmatic access.
And this is de-spite the fact that the availability of easy-to-use li-braries for efficient information access is known tofoster top-level research ?
cf.
the widespread use ofsemantic similarity measures in NLP, thanks to theavailability of WordNet::Similarity (Peder-sen et al, 2004).With the present contribution we aim to fill thisgap in multilingual tools, providing a multi-tieredcontribution consisting of (a) an Application Pro-gramming Interface (API) for efficiently accessingthe information available in BabelNet (Navigli and67bn:00008364n WIKIWN 08420278n 85 WN:EN:bank WIKI:EN:Bank WIKI:DE:Bank WIKI:IT:BancaWIKIRED:DE:Finanzinstitut WN:EN:banking_companyWNTR:ES:banco WNTR:FR:socie?te?_bancaire WIKI:FR:Banque ...35 1_7 2_3,4,9 6_8 ...228 r bn:02945246n r bn:02854884n|FROM_IT @ bn:00034537n ...Figure 1: The Babel synset for bank2n, i.e.
its ?financial?
sense (excerpt, formatted for ease of readability).Ponzetto, 2010), a very large knowledge repositorywith concept lexicalizations in 6 languages (Cata-lan, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish),at the lexicographic (i.e., word senses), encyclope-dic (i.e., named entities) and conceptual (i.e., con-cepts and semantic relations) levels; (b) an API toperform graph-based WSD with BabelNet, thus pro-viding, for the first time, a freely-available toolkit forperforming knowledge-basedWSD in a multilingualand cross-lingual setting.2 BabelNetBabelNet follows the structure of a traditional lex-ical knowledge base and accordingly consists of alabeled directed graph where nodes represent con-cepts and named entities and edges express semanticrelations between them.
Concepts and relations areharvested from the largest available semantic lexi-con of English, i.e., WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), anda wide-coverage collaboratively-edited encyclope-dia, i.e., Wikipedia1, thus making BabelNet a mul-tilingual ?encyclopedic dictionary?
which automati-cally integrates fine-grained lexicographic informa-tion with large amounts of encyclopedic knowledgeby means of a high-performing mapping algorithm(Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010).
In addition to thisconceptual backbone, BabelNet provides a multilin-gual lexical dimension.
Each of its nodes, calledBabel synsets, contains a set of lexicalizations ofthe concept for different languages, e.g., { bankEN,BankDE, bancaIT, .
.
.
, bancoES }.Similar in spirit to WordNet, BabelNet consists,at its lowest level, of a plain text file.
An ex-cerpt of the entry for the Babel synset containingbank2n is shown in Figure 12.
The record contains(a) the synset?s id; (b) the region of BabelNetwhere it lies (e.g., WIKIWN means at the intersec-1http://www.wikipedia.org2We denote with wip the i-th WordNet sense of a word wwith part of speech p.tion of WordNet and Wikipedia); (c) the correspond-ing (possibly empty) WordNet 3.0 synset offset;(d) the number of senses in all languages andtheir full listing; (e) the number of translation re-lations and their full listing; (f) the number of se-mantic pointers (i.e., relations) to other Babelsynsets and their full listing.
Senses encode in-formation about their source ?
i.e., whether theycome from WordNet (WN), Wikipedia pages (WIKI)or their redirections (WIKIRED), or are automatictranslations (WNTR / WIKITR) ?
and about theirlanguage and lemma.
In addition, translation rela-tions among lexical items are represented as a map-ping from source to target senses ?
e.g., 2 3,4,9means that the second element in the list of senses(the English word bank) translates into items #3(German Bank), #4 (Italian banca), and #9 (Frenchbanque).
Finally, semantic relations are encodedusing WordNet?s pointers and an additional sym-bol for Wikipedia relations (r), which can alsospecify the source of the relation (e.g., FROM ITmeans that the relation was harvested from the Ital-ian Wikipedia).
In Figure 1, the Babel synset in-herits the WordNet hypernym (@) relation to finan-cial institution1n (offset bn:00034537n), as wellas Wikipedia relations to the synsets of FINAN-CIAL INSTRUMENT (bn:02945246n) and ETH-ICAL BANKING (bn:02854884n, from Italian).3 An API for multilingual WSDBabelNet API.
BabelNet can be effectively ac-cessed and automatically embedded within applica-tions by means of a programmatic access.
In orderto achieve this, we developed a Java API, based onApache Lucene3, which indexes the BabelNet tex-tual dump and includes a variety of methods to ac-cess the four main levels of information encoded inBabelNet, namely: (a) lexicographic (informationabout word senses), (b) encyclopedic (i.e.
named en-3http://lucene.apache.org681 BabelNet bn = BabelNet.getInstance();2 System.out.println("SYNSETS WITH English word: \"bank\"");3 List<BabelSynset> synsets = bn.getSynsets(Language.EN, "bank");4 for (BabelSynset synset : synsets) {5 System.out.print(" =>(" + synset.getId() + ") SOURCE: " + synset.getSource() +6 "; WN SYNSET: " + synset.getWordNetOffsets() + ";\n" +7 " MAIN LEMMA: " + synset.getMainLemma() + ";\n SENSES (IT): { ");8 for (BabelSense sense : synset.getSenses(Language.IT))9 System.out.print(sense.toString()+" ");10 System.out.println("}\n -----");11 Map<IPointer, List<BabelSynset>> relatedSynsets = synset.getRelatedMap();12 for (IPointer relationType : relatedSynsets.keySet()) {13 List<BabelSynset> relationSynsets = relatedSynsets.get(relationType);14 for (BabelSynset relationSynset : relationSynsets) {15 System.out.println(" EDGE " + relationType.getSymbol() +16 " " + relationSynset.getId() +17 " " + relationSynset.toString(Language.EN));18 }19 }20 System.out.println(" -----");21 }Figure 2: Sample BabelNet API usage.tities), (c) conceptual (the semantic network madeup of its concepts), (d) and multilingual level (in-formation about word translations).
Figure 2 showsa usage example of the BabelNet API.
In the codesnippet we start by querying the Babel synsets forthe English word bank (line 3).
Next, we access dif-ferent kinds of information for each synset: first, weprint their id, source (WordNet, Wikipedia, or both),the corresponding, possibly empty, WordNet offsets,and ?main lemma?
?
namely, a compact string rep-resentation of the Babel synset consisting of its cor-responding WordNet synset in stringified form, orthe first non-redirection Wikipedia page found in it(lines 5?7).
Then, we access and print the Italianword senses they contain (lines 8?10), and finallythe synsets they are related to (lines 11?19).
Thanksto carefully designed Java classes, we are able to ac-complish all of this in about 20 lines of code.Multilingual WSD API.
We use the BabelNet APIas a framework to build a toolkit that allows theuser to performmultilingual graph-based lexical dis-ambiguation ?
namely, to identify the most suitablemeanings of the input words on the basis of the se-mantic connections found in the lexical knowledgebase, along the lines of Navigli and Lapata (2010).At its core, the API leverages an in-house Java li-brary to query paths and create semantic graphswith BabelNet.
The latter works by pre-computingoff-line paths connecting any pair of Babel synsets,which are collected by iterating through each synsetin turn, and performing a depth-first search up to amaximum depth ?
which we set to 3, on the basis ofexperimental evidence from a variety of knowledgebase linking and lexical disambiguation tasks (Nav-igli and Lapata, 2010; Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010).Next, these paths are stored within a Lucene index,which ensures efficient lookups for querying thosepaths starting and ending in a specific synset.
Givena set of words as input, a semantic graph factoryclass searches for their meanings within BabelNet,looks for their connecting paths, and merges suchpaths within a single graph.
Optionally, the pathsmaking up the graph can be filtered ?
e.g., it is possi-ble to remove loops, weighted edges below a certainthreshold, etc.
?
and the graph nodes can be scoredusing a variety of methods ?
such as, for instance,their outdegree or PageRank value in the context ofthe semantic graph.
These graph connectivity mea-sures can be used to rank senses of the input words,thus performing graph-based WSD on the basis ofthe structure of the underlying knowledge base.We show in Figure 3 a usage example of ourdisambiguation API.
The method which performsWSD (disambiguate) takes as input a col-lection of words (i.e., typically a sentence), aKnowledgeBase with which to perform dis-691 public static void disambiguate(Collection<Word> words,2 KnowledgeBase kb, KnowledgeGraphScorer scorer) {3 KnowledgeGraphFactory factory = KnowledgeGraphFactory.getInstance(kb);4 KnowledgeGraph kGraph = factory.getKnowledgeGraph(words);5 Map<String, Double> scores = scorer.score(kGraph);6 for (String concept : scores.keySet()) {7 double score = scores.get(concept);8 for (Word word : kGraph.wordsForConcept(concept))9 word.addLabel(concept, score);10 }11 for (Word word : words) {12 System.out.println("\n\t" + word.getWord() + " -- ID " + word.getId() +13 " => SENSE DISTRIBUTION: ");14 for (ScoredItem<String> label : word.getLabels()) {15 System.out.println("\t [" + label.getItem() + "]:" +16 Strings.format(label.getScore()));17 }18 }19 }2021 public static void main(String[] args) {22 List<Word> sentence = Arrays.asList(23 new Word[]{new Word("bank", ?n?, Language.EN), new Word("bonus", ?n?, Language.EN),24 new Word("pay", ?v?, Language.EN), new Word("stock", ?n?, Language.EN)});25 disambiguate(sentence, KnowledgeBase.BABELNET, KnowledgeGraphScorer.DEGREE);26 }Figure 3: Sample Word Sense Disambiguation API usage.ambiguation, and a KnowledgeGraphScorer,namely a value from an enumeration of differentgraph connectivity measures (e.g., node outdegree),which are responsible for scoring nodes (i.e., con-cepts) in the graph.
KnowledgeBase is an enu-meration of supported knowledge bases: currently, itincludes BabelNet, as well as WordNet++ (namely,an EnglishWordNet-based subset of it (Ponzetto andNavigli, 2010)) and WordNet.
Note that, while Ba-belNet is presently the only lexical knowledge basewhich allows for multilingual processing, our frame-work can easily be extended to work with other ex-isting lexical knowledge resources, provided theycan be wrapped around Java classes and implementinterface methods for querying senses, concepts, andtheir semantic relations.
In the snippet we start inline 3 by obtaining an instance of the factory classwhich creates the semantic graphs for a given knowl-edge base.
Next, we use this factory to create thegraph for the input words (line 4).
We then score thesenses of the input words occurring within this graph(line 5?10).
Finally, we output the sense distribu-tions of each word in lines 11?18.
The disambigua-tion method, in turn, can be called by any other Javaprogram in a way similar to the one highlighted bythe main method of lines 21?26, where we disam-biguate the sample sentence ?bank bonuses are paidin stocks?
(note that each input word can be writtenin any of the 6 languages, i.e.
we could mix lan-guages).4 ExperimentsWe benchmark our API by performing knowledge-based WSD with BabelNet on standard SemEvaldatasets, namely the SemEval-2007 coarse-grainedall-words (Navigli et al, 2007, Coarse-WSD, hence-forth) and the SemEval-2010 cross-lingual (Lefeverand Hoste, 2010, CL-WSD) WSD tasks.
Forboth experimental settings we use a standard graph-based algorithm, Degree (Navigli and Lapata, 2010),which has been previously shown to yield a highlycompetitive performance on different lexical disam-biguation tasks (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010).
Givena semantic graph for the input context, Degree se-lects the sense of the target word with the highestvertex degree.
In addition, in the CL-WSD settingwe need to output appropriate lexicalization(s) indifferent languages.
Since the selected Babel synsetcan contain multiple translations in a target languagefor the given English word, we use for this task an70Algorithm Nouns only All wordsNUS-PT 82.3 82.5SUSSX-FR 81.1 77.0Degree 84.7 82.3MFS BL 77.4 78.9Random BL 63.5 62.7Table 1: Performance on SemEval-2007 coarse-grainedall-words WSD (Navigli et al, 2007).unsupervised approach where we return for each testinstance only the most frequent translation found inthe synset, as given by its frequency of alignmentobtained from the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005).Tables 1 and 2 summarize our results in termsof recall (the primary metric for WSD tasks): foreach SemEval task, we benchmark our disambigua-tion API against the best unsupervised and super-vised systems, namely SUSSX-FR (Koeling andMcCarthy, 2007) and NUS-PT (Chan et al, 2007)for Coarse-WSD, and T3-COLEUR (Guo and Diab,2010) and UvT-v (van Gompel, 2010) for CL-WSD.In the Coarse-WSD task our API achieves the bestoverall performance on the nouns-only subset ofthe data, thus supporting previous findings indicat-ing the benefits of using rich knowledge bases likeBabelNet.
In the CL-WSD evaluation, instead, us-ing BabelNet alows us to surpass the best unsuper-vised system by a substantial margin, thus indicatingthe viability of high-performing WSD with a multi-lingual lexical knowledge base.
While our perfor-mance still lags behind the application of supervisedtechniques to this task (cf.
also results from Lefeverand Hoste (2010)), we argue that further improve-ments can still be obtained by exploiting more com-plex disambiguation strategies.
In general, using ourtoolkit we are able to achieve a performance whichis competitive with the state of the art for these tasks,thus supporting previous findings on knowledge-richWSD, and confirming the robustness of our toolkit.5 Related WorkOur work complements recent efforts focused on vi-sual browsing of wide-coverage knowledge bases(Tylenda et al, 2011; Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012)by means of an API which allows the user to pro-grammatically query and search BabelNet.

In comparison with other contribu-tions, our toolkit for multilingual WSD takes pre-vious work from Navigli (2006), in which an on-line interface for graph-based monolingual WSD ispresented, one step further by adding a multilin-gual dimension as well as a full-fledged API.
Ourwork also complements previous attempts by NLPresearchers to provide the community with freelyavailable tools to perform state-of-the-art WSD us-ing WordNet-based measures of semantic related-ness (Patwardhan et al, 2005), as well as supervisedWSD techniques (Zhong and Ng, 2010).
We achievethis by building upon BabelNet, a multilingual ?en-cyclopedic dictionary?
bringing together the lexico-graphic and encyclopedic knowledge from WordNetand Wikipedia.
Other recent projects on creatingmultilingual knowledge bases from Wikipedia in-clude WikiNet (Nastase et al, 2010) and MENTA(de Melo and Weikum, 2010): both these resourcesoffer structured information complementary to Ba-belNet ?
i.e., large amounts of facts about entities(MENTA), and explicit semantic relations harvestedfrom Wikipedia categories (WikiNet).AcknowledgmentsThe authors gratefully acknowledgethe support of the ERC Starting GrantMultiJEDI No.
