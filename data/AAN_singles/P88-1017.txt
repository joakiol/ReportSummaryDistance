MID Tower, 2-1-61 Shiromi, Higashi-ku, Osaka 540, JapanAbstractThis paper presents a unification-based approach toJapanese honorifics based on a version of HPSG (Head-drivenPhrase Structure Grammar)ll\]121.
Utterance parsing is basedon lexical specifications of each lexical item, includinghonorifics, and a few general PSG rules using a parser capableof unifying cyclic feature structures.
It is shown that thepossible word orders of Japanese honorific predicateconstituents can be automatically deduced in the proposedframework wi thout  independently specifying them.Discourse Information Change Rules (DICRs) that al lowresolving a class of anaphors in honorific contexts are alsoformulated.1.
In t roduct ionJapanese has a rich grammaticalized system of honorificsto express the speaker's honorific attitudes toward discourseagents (i.e.
persons who are related to the discourse).
Asopposed to such written texts as scientific or newspaperarticles, where the author's rather 'neutral' honorific attitudeis required, in spoken dialogues, an abundant number ofhonorific expressions is used and plays an important role inresolving human zero-anaphors.In this paper, a unification-based approach to Japanesehonorifics is proposed.
First, Mizutani's theory of honorificexpression actl3\] is introduced to define basic honorificattitude types used in specifying pragmatic onstraints on theuse of Japanese honorifics.
Then a range of honorifics areclassified into subtypes from a morphological and syntactico-semantic perspective and examples of their  lexicalspecifications are shown.
The main characteristics of theutterance parser and an approach to explaining possibleword orders of honorific predicate constituents are described.Finally, Discourse Information Change Rules are formulatedthat resolve a class of anaphors in honorific contexts.2.
Speaker's Honor i f ic  At t i tudes  toward  DiscourseAgents2.1.
Grammatical  Aspects of  Honori f icsA distinction must be made between the speaker'shonorific attitude as determined by the utterance situation(the social relationship between discourse agents, theatmosphere of the setting, etc), and the honorific attitude asexpressed by special linguistic means independent of the?
utterance situation.
For example, by violating a usageprinciple for the determination of an honorific attitude (i.e.
"one should not exalt oneself in front of others"), uses of anhonorific expression about the speaker himself can functionas a kind of joke.
However, without he help of grammaticalproperties of honorifics independent of particular utterancesituations, the violation of a usage principle itself could notbe recognized at all, thus the expression could not function asa joke.
Though the former situational determination ofhonorific attitude is an interesting subject matter for socioand psycho-linguistic researchers, the latter grammaticalproperties of hot~orifics are our concern here and what isdescribed with lexical specifications for honorifics.2.2.
Mizutani 's  Theory  o f  Honor i f ic  Expression ActMizutani's theory of honorif ic expression act isintroduced to define basic honorific attitude types thatstipulate the pragmatic onstraints on Japanese honorifics.
Inthis model, discourse agents are positioned in an ~bstracttwo-dimenslonal honorific space (Fig.
1).
How they arepositioned is a socio and psycho-linguistic problem, which isnot pursued here.Agent P (px,py)Hearer (hx,hy) e e~,~Speaker (0,0) ~"Agent Q (qx,qy)IFig 1.
Honorific SpaceAn honorific expresson act reflects the configuraion ofthese discourse agent points.
The speaker is set as the pointof origin, and the speaker's honorific attitude toward adiscourse agent, say P, is defined as the position vector ofpoint P. The speaker's honorific attitude toward agent Prelative to agent Q is defined as a vector from point Q topoint P. The value and the direction of the vector are definedas follows:139Honorific Value :for v = (x. y), the honorific value of a vector v (writtenas IvJ) is defined as:Ivl = y i f fx=0;0 i f fx  ~0;Honorific Direction :a. up I , t>0 ,b. down Ivi < O,c.
f lat Iv~=O and x=O,d.
across Ivl = 0 and x ~ O.IN.B.J Assuming an honorific space to be two dimensional (not onedimensional), an across direction can be distinguished from a fiat direction.An acrosS direction of a vector corresponds to the case where no positivehonorific relation between the two agents (i.e.
up, down, or flat) isrecognized by the speaker.Though the speaker's honor i f i c  a t t i tudes  can becharacterized from several v iewpoints  (e.g.
up/down,d is tant /c lose,  fo rmal / in fo rmal ) ,  Mizutan i ' s  mode l  isappropriate for describing Japanese honorifics because theup~down aspect most relevantly characterizes Japanesehonorifics.
Moreover, i t  is not clear how the other aspects areindependently grammatical ized in the Japanese honorif icsystem.Based on the direction of the vector defined above, thefol lowing four subtypes of honorific att i tude relations aredistinguished.Honorific Att itude Type :a. honor-upb.

Morpho log ica l  V iewpo intIn Japanese, words in a wide range of syntactic categories(i.e.
nouns, verbs, adjectives, nominal-verbs, nomina l -adjectives, etc) are systematically put into their  honorif icforms.
They are classified into two  subtypes according to howthey are derived from their nonhonorific forms.Classification by the lexical derivation type:honorif ic-word =a.
regular-form-honorif ic-word(e.g.
"ookak-i" from "kak-i" \[writevinf\])\[HP-\[writevstem-CSinf\]lb.
irregular-form-honorif ic-word(e.g.
"ossyar-" from "iw-" \[speakvstem\])|N.B.\] HP and CS stand for 'Honoric Prefix' and 'Conjugation Suffix'respectively.
Words is transcribed in its phonemic representation.While regular-form honorific words share a common basewith their nonhonorific forms because they are derived bythe productive honorif ic-affixation process, irregular-formhonorific words have special word forms that have no directconnection to their nonhonorific forms.
This distiction playsan important role in the lexical specification of honorifics andin possible word orders of Japanese honorif ic predicateconstituents.3.1.2.
Syntact i co -Semant ic  V iewpo intIn traditional school grammar, Japanese honorifics havebeen classified into  three categor ies:  respect words('sonkeigo'), condescending words ('kenjougo'), and pol itewords ('teineigo').
However, in this tradit ional  tr ipart i teclassif ication, common features of respect-words andcondescending-words not shared by pol ite-words are notexplicit.
That is, while an agent toward whom the speaker'shonorific attitude is expressed must be grammatically locatedin the sentence (i.e.
as subject or object) in the case of respector condescending words, this requirement does not apply topolite words.
Thus a more elaborate classification is adopted.Conventional terms are replaced by Haradal4l 's moresyntactico-semantically motivated ones.Classification by the syntactic role of an aqent to whom thespeaker's honorific attitude is expressed:honorif ic-word =a.
proposit ional-honorif ic-word=a.
1. subject-honorific-word (respect-word)(e.g.
"kudaser-u" \[give~nf\])a.2.object-honorific-word(condescendiog-word)(e.g.
"sesiage-ru" lgivev~ef\])b. performative-honorif ic-word (polite-word)(e.g.
'des-u', 'mas-u')IN.B.\] For example, averb which takes a nonanimete subject (e.g.
"fur-u"in the sentece "Ame (rain) ga (SBJ) fur-u(fall).
?
IThe rain falb.\]) can be putinto its performative honorific form ('Ame ga fur-i mas-u.
'), but not into itssubject honorific form (* "Ante ga o-for-t ni nar-u.').
This is in accordancewith the difference between propositional honorifics and performativehonorificl.IN.B.\] There are a class of words which function in between the a.2 and btypes of honorifics (e.g.
"mair-u" \[go/come~\] in "Basu ga mair-i mas-u.
"\[A bus will come.\]).
Let us call them propositional-performattve-wordl.Minus-honorifics are given no place in the tradit ionaltripartite classification.
However, they are classified in ourapproach as correponding to the expressed honorific attitudetypes.140Classification by the expressed honorific attitude type:honorific-word =a.
plus-honorific-word(e.g.
"aw-a-re-ru" \[meetregular.sbjhon\])\[{.,.meet~tem'CSvong\]-PlusHonAuxv~tem-CSaml\]b. minus-honorific-word(e.g.
"aw-i-yagar-u" \[meetregular-sbjhon\])\[\[...meet~em-C$1nf|-MinusHonAux~tm-CSm~JIN B.\] The Japanese honorific system has no systematized means topositively express honor-flat or honor-across honorific attitudes.
An non-honorific plain word form may express honor-flat honorific attitudes towerda discourse agent in a situation such as speaking to an old friend, while it mayexpress honor-across honorific attitudes in a situation such as writing atechnical paper.Because the classfications of honorifics from differentviewpoints as summarized above are cross-categorical, andthus independent of one another, a single honorific word(e.g.
"hozak-u" \[sayvsenf\]) can function at the same time asirregular-form-honorific-word, subject-honorific-word, andminus-honorific-word.3.2.
A Unif ication-based Lexical ApproachA unification-based lexicalism approach is adopted herefor describing Japanese honorifics for the following reasons:(a) a unification-based approach enables the integrateddescription of information from various kinds of sources(syntax, semantics, etc), thus allowing their simultaneousanalysis;(b) a lexical approach helps to increase the modularity ofgrammar.
In this approach, a grammar has only a smallnumber of general syntactic rule schemata and most ofgrammatical information is to be specified in a lexicon.Linguistic word-class generalizations can be formed bymaking grammatical categories complex by representingthem with feature-structures.The specification of verbal category honorifics isimportant because the verbal categories are the mostproductive in the honorification process, and thusappropriate to clearly show how diverse aspects of theJapanese honorific system are described in this approach.3.3.
Examples of lexical specifications3.3.1.
Regular-Form HonorificsSubject Honorif icat ion by "Vvong + (ra)re-ru"Regular form honorifics are compositionally analyzed bygiving lexical specifications for each honorific-wordformation formative.
For example, most plain-form verbs canbe put into their simple subject-plus-honorific form bypostpositioning the auxiliary verb "(ra)re-ru" to them ('re-ru" and "rare-ru" are allomorphs of a single morpheme).Lexical information for these formatives is specified in thefeature structure:\ [ \ [orth(orthography) ?orth\]\[head \[\[pos(part-or-speech) v\]\[ctype(conJugat|on-type) vowel\]\[cform(conJugatton-rorm) stem\]I \]\[adjacent ?prod\]\[subcat (?sbJ\[\[haad \[\[pos p\]\ [gr f (grmmat ice l - funct ton)  sbJ \ ] \ ] \ ]\[subcat 0 )\[sam ?sbJsem\]\[sear \[\[huNn +\]\]\]\]?prad\[\[heed \[\[pos v\]\[ctype ?predctype\]\ [cfor l l  vong(vofce-nagattva)\]\[subcet {~sbJ}\]\[sea ?predsem\]\])\]\[Sam ?predsam\]\[prsg \ [ \ [ res t rs  { \ [ \ [ re ln  honor-up\]\ [or ig in  espeakar e\]\[goal TshJsem\]\])\]\]\]\])where <?orth ?pradctypa> E (<'ra"  cons><'rBre" ( :o r  vowelkurusuru)>)Fig 2.

*Speaker* is a special global variable bound to a featurestru~ure representing the speaker's information.The 'prag' feature describes the pragmatic constraint onthis expression (the "honor-up" relationship from thespeaker to the subject agent of the predicate is required forthis expression to be used in a pragmatically appropriateway).
Description with the 'honor-up' honorific attituderelation shows that this expression is a 'plus-honorific'expression.
Structure-sharing of the 'goal' feature value ofthis honorifc attitude relation with the semantic value of thepredicate's subject shows that this expression is a 'subject-honorific' expression.
The requirement for the 'orth' featurevalue (?
'orth) and the 'ctype' value in the 'subcat' feature(?predctype) describes the morphophonemic haracteristic ofthis morpheme by stipulating that 're-(ru)' subcategorize foreither a regular consonant-stem ctype verb or an irregularctype verb ('suru'\[do\]), and that 'rare-(ru)' subcategorize foreither a regular vowel-stem ctype verb or an irregular ctypeverb ('kuru' \[come\]), correctly allowing (la) and (lc) but notfib).

The specification of this featureimplies that this morph is a bound morph and thus requires itsadjacent element to be realized as a nonnull phonetic form.Though the set description in the 'subcat' value is introducedto a l low word order variation among complement daughtersin Japanese ,  w i thout  th i s  k ind  o f  spec i f i ca t ion ,ungrammatical sequences such as ( ld)  are also al lowed forauxil iariy verbs.\[N.B.)

Furthermore,<?c ?b ?a>.
for example, is expanded into a feature structure such as\[Jfirst ?c\]\[rest \[Ifirst 7bnrest Ilfirst ?a\]\[rest end\]\].Object Honorification by "HP  + Vinf  + suru"Next, let  us consider a more compl icated fo rmat ionpattern for deriving a regular object-plus-honorific form.
Asproductive as the above "Vvong + (ra)re-ru" pattern is, an"HP +Vinf +suru" pattern can put most verbs w i th  twogrammatical  human arguments into thei r  correspondingobject honorific forms as follows:"o + aw-i + suru" from "aw-"  (meetvstem),"go + shoukai + suru" from "shoukai" (introduce-verse).IN.B.\] "o," and "go-" are two forms of s single morpheme (honorificprefix) that is prefixed to words in a variety of syntactic categories (SeeAppendix I).
The choice depends on the following element's origin.
If theelement is a Sine-Japanese morpheme (kango), the honorifc prefix takes theform "go-'; if it is a native one, the honorific prefix is realized as "o-',though there are exceptions.In a naive analysis of Japanese honorifics, these honorificforms derive from their  corresponding plain forms by a simpleobject honori f icat ion lexical rule that  does not  take intoaccount their internal constituent structures (e.g.
"aw-u" --)"o-aw-i-suru').
Accordingly, this kind of naive analysis isinadequate for the fo l lowing reasons:Ca) it is arguable that  "HP+Vinf"  forms a uni t  in somestructural level before forming the unit  "HP + Vinf + suru' ,cons ider ing  the  ex is tence o f  such const ruct ions  as" l I P+Vin f+n i+nar -u"  (normal -sb j -p lus -hon- fo rm) ,"HP + Vinf + negaw-u( request ) ' ,  and "HP + Vinf + i tadak-u(receive-favorirregular.obj.plus.hon.form)', but this assertion isnot explicitly illustrated in a naive ana4~sis;(b) though some adverb ia l  postposi t ions such as "we"(contrastive), "me"  (also) and "sae" (even) can appear insidethe object  honor i f ic  form (e.g.
"o -aw- i -WA-suru ' ,  "go-shoukai-SAE-MO-suru'), it  is diff icult to derive these forms bya naive analysis in l ight of the general izat ion concerningadverbial postpositions appearing in other environments(e.g.
"Sensei ga kyoositu DAKE e WAko rare ta" \[the teachercame only to the classroom\] );(c) a naive analysis fails to explain the kind of the elementsthat can operate as a Vinf element in the pattern, which isautomatically explained in the proposed framework as wil l  beshown in section 5.This regu lar  ob jec t -p lus -honor i f i ca t ion  process iscomposit ional ly  analyzed in the proposed f ramework  bygiving each of its formatives a lexical specification, inthe samemanner as the "Vvong + (ra)re-ru" pat tern  subject-plus-honorific analysis.Here the expression "o-aw-i-suru" is analized.

Honorific prefixation ruleIN.B.i The rule stated in an extended version of PATR41 notation consistsof two parts; CFG-part and constraints.
CFG-part is used to propose anefficient top-down expectation in the parser.
Constraints are required forthe rule application to end successfully.
Here, all constraints are described byequations of two feature structures.
?< >" is used to denote a featurestructure path, and ?
, , "  to denote a token identity relation between twofeature structures.142The 'headlcoh(CategoryOfHead)' feature of a categoryspecifies the kind of its head.
An HP can take a lexicalinfinitive-form verb whose 'can-take-hp' value is' + '.
An HP isassigned its appropriate realization form (.)
(in this case, "o"form), because its 'orth' value and the head's 'hpform' valueare the same.
The first equation in the rule statementprevents a second application of the honorific prefixationrule to the same verb (*'o-o-aw-i ?)
by specifying that themother category's 'can-take-hp' feature value be ,., (**) Theother equations in the rule are ones common to the adjunct-head structures.I*N.B.\] A note is needed here concerning the realization of Hr.
When theadjacent feature of the second right-hand-side symbol in the CFG-part is nilas in the above case, it is enough just to concatenate both 'orth' featurevalues of the right-hand-side symbols and make it the 'orth' feature value ofthe left-hand-side symbol.
However.
when the head element's adjacentfeature has a nonnull value (i.e.
in the case that the head element is n boundmorph)o a more complicted operation is needed.
But here we only mentionits necessity and avoid its precise formulation to save space.I**N.BJ The 'can-take-hp' feature is specified as '-' not only for already HP-prefixed elements, but also for almost all irregular form honorific verbs (e.g.
*'o-osshar-i'lsay\], *'o-itadak-i'lreceive*favorD and most mono-synablicinfinitive-form verbs that have corresponding irregular-form honorifics (e.g.
*'o-si" \[doJ, *'o-mi" \[look atJ).Next, the usual complement-head structure rule (Fig 3.d)is applied to the resulting feature structure for "o-aw-i" andthe feature structure for a normal object-plus honorificationformative ('-suru', as shown in Fig 3.e).
Thus the normalobject plus honorifc form ('o-aw-i-(suru)') for "aw-'\[meet\] isobtained in a compositional way.

I r regular  Form Honor i f icsIrregular form honorifics share most of their lexicalinformation with their nonhonorific counterparts.
In ourframework, redundant lexical specification for irregular-formhonorifics is avoided by using lexical inheritance mechanismfrom their superclassas.
For example, the necessary lexicalspecification for the irregular subject honorific form "(-te)itadak-" of the donatory auxiliary verb "(-te)moraw-" isreduced, as shown in Fig 4.a.
This turns out to be equivalentto Fig 4.b by unifying pieces of information from its super-classes, te-receive-favor and obj-plus-hon.

Uni f icat ion-based CFG ParserFig 5 shows the organization of the unification-based CFGparser.
The parser is essentially based on Earley's algorithm,and unifies feature structures in its completion process.
Thedescription of grammatical rules and lexical items arecomplied into feature structures by the rule reader.Unification of cyclic feature structuers might be necessaryto analyze certain expressions.
To give some examples:(a) frozen honorific words such as "o-naka" (belly) and "go-ran" (to look at) must always be prefixed by an HP (theelement in bold face);(b) the polite form ('gozar-') of the verb "ar-'/ ' ir-" (to be)almost always needs to be followed by the polite honorificauxiliary verb "-masu" in modern Japanese.143~ ' ~  Sauce WmwwI ~"~"  ItUtterance Pmrser based on Earley's algorithm I~ l ~  ~-~ Festwestm(t~emtlficJitl(m \] IFig 5.

Word  Order  o f  Honor i f i c  Predicate Const i tuentsIn Japanese, a verbal predicate is composed of one mainverb and postpositioned auxiliary verbs (though possiblynone exist).
Because both main verbs and auxiliary verbs mayhave honorific forms, various sequences of honorifics mightbe expected to occur in a predicate as a simple matter ofpossible combinations.
However, their possible word ordersare restricted by a grammatical principles.
Traditionally,possibile word orders were described in detail and thesRESTFig 6.
Cyclic part of the compiled feature structure144explanations for them were given from a rather speculativeperspective.
In this research, it is shown how possible wordorders can be deduced from lexical specifications ofhonorifics.5.1.
Propos i t ional  and Performat ive Honor i f icsA propositional honorific formative always precedes aperformative honorific formative.
For example, though"awa-re-masu" (\[\[\[meetvong\]-SbjPIusHon\]-PerformativeHon\])and "o-awi-s i -masu" (\[\[\[HP-meetvlnf\]-ObjPlusHonJ-PerformativeHon\]) are possible expressions, they would beimpossible i f  their  word orders were reversed (i.e.performative honorif ic placed before proposit ionalhonorific).This restr ict ion on word order is considered aconsequence of the lexical specifications for both types ofhonori f ics.
As shown in section 3, proposit ionalhonorification formatives subcategorize a verbal categorywhose subject (and object) elements are not filled yet as itsadjacent element.
On the other hand, a performativehonorification formative subcategorizes a verbal categorywith saturated subcategorization.
This represents the lexicalspecification for "mesu ?.\[\[orth " ' \ ]\[heed \[\[pos v\]\[ctype musu\]\[cforll stem\]\[4rrugullr-cforlu \[\[senf mesu\]...\]\]\]\]\[cen-tlko-hp -\]\[adjacent ?prod\]\[subcut {?prud\[\[heud \[\[pos v\]\[cform usu\]\]\]\[suhcet (}\]\[sea ?predsum\]\]\]J\[sims ?prudsms\]\[prig \[\[restrs {\[\[reln honor-up\]\[ordgdn Ospuakure\]loom1 *hem.re\]\]}\]\] \] \]Fig 7.
Lexical Specification for a performative honorificationformative "masu"The performative honorif icaton formative "masu"cannot, therefore, immediately precede a propositionalhonorification formative due to the requirement concerningthe adjacent element of propositional honorifics.
Theopposite order, however, constitutes a syntacticallylegitimate structure.5.2.
Subject and Object Honor i f icsAn object honorific formative must precede a subjecthonorific formative, though there is an important class ofexceptions (verbs that subcategorize a 'te' form verb as anadjacent element such as "(-te)itadak-'\[receive-favor\]).
Forexample, "o-awi-sa-reru" (\[\[\[HP-meetvtnf\]-ObjPlusHon|-SbjPIusHon\]) is a possible word order, but "o-awa-re-suru"(\[\[HP-\[meetvong-SbjPlusHon\]\]-ObjPlusHon\]) i  not possible if"-re(ru)" is used as an honorification formative.
This wordorder restriction can be explained in the same way as for theabove case: that is, as shown in section 3, the normal objecthonorif ication formative %suru" subcategorizes a verbwhose subject and object are not yet filled.
The simple subjecthonor|float|on formative "-(ra)reru" that requires its object tobe already fi l led cannot, therefore, precede the normalsubject plus honor i f i ca t ion  fo rmat ive  on account ofconflicting specifications for the 'subcat' value.
Otherwise,no conflict exist.Other kinds of restrictions on the possible word order ofJapanese honorific predicate constituents can likewise beexplained in the proposed framework.6.
Anaphora  Reso lut ion  in Honor i f ic  ContextsIn Japanese honorific contexts, many human anaphorscan be resolved by recourse to pragmatic constraints on theuse of honorifics.
This is an attempt to apply DR theory to theanaphora resolution in Japanse honorific contexts.Discourse information is represented by a featurestructure consisting of a set of reference markers (Universe)and a set of conditions, as in the standard version of DR(Discourse Representation) theoryl7\].
Fig 8.a is the initiallyposited DRS (Discourse Representation Structure).
Additionof other discourse information to the initial ORS does notaffect the theory.\[\[unfv (\[\[rm espeakare\[\[type ' tndfvtdual \ ] \ ] \ ]\[\[l'm eheeureC\[type 'tnd4vtdual\]\]\]\[\[rm *now*\[\[type 'temporal- location|||J im *heree\[\[type 'spatfo1-1ocatfon\]\]\]}\]\[conds {}3\]Fig 8.a.

Resulting Semantic Information for (3b)Because the index 7x18 for "song keisan-gengogaku-sha"(that computational linguist) has a \]familiarity '+\] attributebased on the lexical specification for 'song', an attempt ismade to resolve it by unifying 7x16 with an element of thekluniv value, requiring that their restrictions can also beunif ied.
It stands to  reason that  i t  can be resolvedbecause 7x16 and 7x02 are, semantically speaking, unifiable,because their semantic restrictions are {\[\]rein 'computational-linguist\]!instance 7x16\]\]} and \[\[\[reln 'computational-linguist\]linstance ?x02\]\] Ilreln 'famous)\[instance ?x02\]\]) respectively, andtheir variable types are both 'individual', which causes noincompatibility.
However, their pragmatic restrictions({llreln 'honor-downJlagent %peeker*)lob\]act 7x16|\] \[\[reln "honor-upJlagent %peaker*\]lobject "hearer*\]\]}, and {(\[reln 'honor-up)\[agent*speaker*)lob\]act ?x02\]\] \]It*In 'honor-up\]iagent *speeker*\]lobject*hearer*)l}) prevent ?x16 from being unified with ?x02, due tothe stipulation 'llreln 'honor-up\]\[agent ?ailobject ?b\]\] A \[Ireln 'honor-down)\[agent ?el\]object ?b)\] - bottom'.
This anaphoric resolutiontherefore fails.
Other ways of resolving this anaphoricexpression also fail because of the incompatibi l ity of theirvariable types or semantic features.
In any case, utterance(3b) turns out to be infelicitous by NFC.Unlike (3b), utterance (3b'), whose sem/prag values arethe same as Fig 8.c except  for  \[\[rein 'honor-up)\[agent*speaker*)lob\]act ?x16\]\] instead of \[\]rein 'honor-down)\[agent*speaker*)\]object ?x16\]\], can be given a fel ic itous reading,because anaphora resolution is possible w i thout  violat ingNFC in this case,(3) b'.

($b~Though many issues rermain unaddressed concerninganaphora resolution in Japanese honorific contexts, these canbe approached by use of the proposed model.
This modelregards discourse understanding as the process of unifyingvarious kinds of partial information, including contextualinformation.7.
CondusionA unification-based approach to Japanese honorificsbased on a version of HPSG was proposed.
Utterance parsingis based on the lexical specifications of a range of honorificsusing a parser capable of unifying cyclic feature structures.The developed parser constitutes an impor tant  part ofNADINE (NAtural  Dialogue INterpretat ion Expert),  anexperimental system which translates Japanese-Englishtelephone and inter-keyboard ialogues.AcknowledementThe authors are deeply grateful to Dr. Kurematsu, the president of ATRInterpreting Telephony Research Laboratories.
