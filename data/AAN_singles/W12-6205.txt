Theyhave established that most of them do not utilizesemantic properties.
The integration of semanticproperties into morphological analyzers can sig-nificantly enhance the performance of any tool thatuses their output as input, e.g., for derivation or forsyntactic parsing.
In this paper will be presentedmy approach to the integration of aspectually rele-vant properties of verbs into a morphological ana-lyzer for English.In section 2 I will describe a prototypical finite-state morphological analyzer for English thatdoesn?t utilize semantic properties.
Some classifi-cations of English verbs with respect to the aspec-tually relevant properties that they lexicalize willbe outlined in section 3.
In section 4 will be pre-sented my approach to the integration the semanticclasses in the lexicon.
I will describe the modifiedmorphological analyzer for English in section 5and point out in section 6 the challenges thatinflectionally-rich languages present to the tech-niques outlined in section 4.Finally, in section 7 I will draw some conclu-sions and outline future work on other languages.2 A Prototypical Finite-State Morpho-logical Analyzer for EnglishEnglish is an inflectionally-poor language whichfor this reason has been chosen to illustrate myapproach to the integration of grammatically rele-vant lexicalized meaning into morphological ana-lyzers.
It has a finite number of irregular (strong)verbs.
The rest of the verbs are regular and consti-tute a single inflectional class.This prototypical morphological analyzer forEnglish has parallel implementations in xfst (cf.Beesley and Karttunen (2003)) and foma (cf.
Hul-den (2009a) and (2009b)).
It consists of a lexiconthat describes the morphotactics of the language,and of phonological and orthographical alterna-tions and realizational rules that are handled byfinite-state replace rules elsewhere.
The bases ofthe regular verbs are stored in a single text file.Here is an excerpt from the lexc lexicon withoutsemantic features:LEXICON RootVerb ;?LEXICON Verb^VREG     VerbReg ;?LEXICON VerbReg+V:0       VerbRegFlex ;?!
This lexicon contains the morpho-tactic rules.LEXICON VerbRegFlex< ["+Pres"] ["+3P"] ["+Sg"]  > # ;< ["+Pres"] ["+Non3PSg"]  > # ;< ["+Past"] >   # ;< ["+PrPart"|"+PaPart"] >  # ;< ["+Inf"] >  # ;303 Aspectually Relevant Properties ofVerbsThe information that is provided by the prototypi-cal analyzer described above contains lemma,W(ord)-features (morphosyntactic features thatexhibit different specifications in different cells ofthe same inflectional paradigm) and L(exeme)-features that ?specify a lexeme?s invariant mor-phosyntactic properties?
(e.g., gender of nouns, cf.Stump (2001), p. 137, emphasis mine).L-features should not be confused with lexical-ized meaning.
I adopt the definition in RappaportHovav and Levin (2010), p. 23: ?In order to distin-guish lexicalized meaning from inferences derivedfrom particular uses of verbs in sentences, we takelexicalized meaning to be those components ofmeaning that are entailed in all uses of (a singlesense of) a verb, regardless of context?
(emphasismine).
Obviously, this definition is applicable notonly to verbs but to all word classes.However, in this paper I will limit myself to thedescription of lexicalized aspectually relevantproperties of verbs.3.1 Vendler?s ClassificationIn his famous paper ?Verbs and Times?
Vendler(1957) introduced his ?time schemata presupposedby various verbs?
(ibid.).
He proposes four timeschemata: states, activities, accomplishments andachievements.It is important to point out from the beginningthat although he didn?t declare explicitly that hewas classifying VPs, he did imply this: ?Obviouslythese differences cannot be explained in terms oftime alone: other factors, like the presence orabsence of an object, conditions, intended stateof affairs, also enter the picture.?
(ibid., p. 143,emphasis mine).The properties that are often used to defineVendler?s classes are dynamicity, duration andtelicity.
States are non-dynamic, achievements arenon-durative.
States and activities are inherentlyunbounded (non-telic); accomplishments andachievements are inherently bounded.
Since threefeatures are needed to differentiate between onlyfour classes that cannot be represented as, e.g., aright-branching tree one wonders if these are theright features to be used for the classification.Vendler?s classification was widely acceptedand is used in most current studies on aspect.However, Vendlerian classes cannot be imple-mented in a lexc lexicon for the following reasons:?
Vendler does not classify verbs but VPs?
Part of the features used to differentiate be-tween the classes are not lexicalized by theverb but can be determined at the VP level?
This classification allows multiple classmembership even for the same word sense.Thus run can be activity and accomplish-ment, cf.
above running/running a mile.3.2 Levin and Rappaport Hovav?s Approachto English Verb classesSets of semantically related verbs that share arange of linguistic properties form verb classes.There are different criteria for grouping and granu-larity, e.g., Levin (1993) classifies the verbs in twoways: a) according to semantic content with 48broad classes and 192 smaller classes; b) accordingto their participation in argument alternations with79 alternations.
The account of Beth Levin andMalka Rappaport Hovav for verb classes devel-oped over the years in a steady and consistent waythat can be trailed in the following publications:(Levin 1993; Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1991,1995, 2005; Rappaport Hovav 2008; RappaportHovav and Levin 1998, 2001, 2005, 2010), amongothers.Here I will just summarize the most importantideas and implications for the non-stative verbs:?
Dynamic verbs either lexicalize scales (sca-lar verbs) or do not (non-scalar verbs)?
Non-scalar verbs lexicalize manner?
Scalar verbs lexicalize result?
Scalar verbs lexicalize two major types ofscales ?
multi-point scales and two-pointscales?
The chosen aspectually relevant propertiesare complementary?
All lexical distinctions described here havegrammatical consequences which are rele-vant to aspectual composition.This interpretation of non-stative verbs has somevery attractive properties:?
The verbs fall into disjunctive classes.There is no multiple class membership (forthe same word sense).?
The aspectual properties are lexicalized ex-clusively by the verb and are not computedat the VP level.31?
The lexicalized aspectual properties con-strain the syntactical behavior of the verb.?
Manner verbs in English show a uniformargument-realization pattern: they can ap-pear with unspecified and non-subcategorized objects.?
Result verbs are more constrained and lessuniform in their argument realization pat-terns.
Transitivity (in contrast to the mannerverbs) is an issue.4 Intersection of Semantic Classes andInflectional ClassesThe main difficulties here arise from the fact thatthe set of bases that belong to one inflectional classof verbs usually is not identical with the set ofbases that lexicalize a particular aspectually rele-vant property.
As a rule, it has intersections withmore than one semantic class.
The situation is rela-tively manageable in inflectionally-poor languageslike English but becomes very complicated ininflectionally-rich languages.The distribution of verbs in inflectional classesis in general complementary.
There are some ex-ceptions that will not be discussed here.Vendler?s approach to the verb classificationdescribed in 3.1 has the undesirable property thatmost of the verbs have multiple class membership,while the approach of Levin and Rappaport Hovavdescribed in 3.2 has advantages which make thetask easier.Thus, for English we have the set of bases ofregular verbs that is monolithic, and the same setof bases but this time divided into complementarysubsets of aspectual semantic classes in the senseof Levin and Rappaport Hovav.
The cross productof the number of subsets in the first set and thenumber of subsets in the second set equals thenumber of aspectual semantic classes since there isonly one inflectional class of regular verbs.5 The modified Prototypical Lexicon forEnglishThe following modifications need to be introducedto the lexicon in order to incorporate the aspectualproperties of English verbs.The single placeholder pointing to the singlefile containing the bases of regular verbs must bereplaced with several placeholders that point to thefiles containing the complementary subsets ofbases of verbs belonging to the different aspectualclasses.New continuation lexicons introducing each as-pectual class must be added immediately afterLEXICON Verb.
Since the union of the sets ofaspectual-class bases of regular verbs is identicalwith the set of the bases of the regular verbs, allaspectual-class lexicons have the same continua-tion lexicon: LEXICON VerbRegFlex.
Irregularverbs get the semantic tags added to the lexicalentry and suppletive verbs get them in the masterlexicon.Multichar_Symbols+V +VIrrTT %<manner%>?LEXICON RootVerb ;VerbSuppl ;?LEXICON VerbSupplgo%<resmulpo%>+V+Inf:go  # ;go%<resmulpo%>+V+Pres+3P+Sg:goes # ;go%<resmulpo%>+V+Pres+Non3PSg:go # ;go%<resmulpo%>+V+Past:went  # ;go%<resmulpo%>+V+PaPart:gone  # ;go%<resmulpo%>+V+PrPart:going # ;?LEXICON Verb^VREGM     VerbRegManner ;?LEXICON VerbRegManner+V%<manner%>:0 VerbRegFlex ;LEXICON VerbRegFlex?Below is an excerpt from the file holding thebases of irregular verbs that build identical past-tense and perfect-participle forms by adding ?-t?:?

Theadvantage of this approach to already existing mor-phological analyzers for English is that thevalency-pattern tags are added to classes of verbsrather than to individual lexical entries.
The abilityto provide alternative outputs for the integratedaspectually relevant semantic information is a nov-elty of this morphological analyzer.6 Beyond English: the Challenges of In-flectionally-Rich LanguagesWe have seen a simplified example that shows themodeling and the implementation of a morphologi-cal analyzer that utilizes semantic-class tags foraspectually relevant lexical properties of Englishverbs.Things become much more challenging if wewant to model inflectionally-rich languages such asBulgarian, Russian or Finnish.
Bulgarian verbs, forexample, can be divided (depending on the model-ing) into some 15 complementary inflectionalclasses.
This number multiplied by 4 Levin-Rappaport-Hovav classes would result in some 60sets of verb bases that share the same inflectionalclass and Levin-Rappaport-Hovav class.
If a finer-grained semantic classification is adopted, thenumber of classes will considerably increase andthis will lead to a lexicon that exclusively requiresmanual lexicographical work.7 ConclusionThis paper illustrates the integration of aspectuallyrelevant properties of verbs into a morphologicalanalyzer for English.
I showed that these featurescan be integrated while the computational effi-ciency of the analyzer can still be maintained if thelinguistic modelling is adequate.
However, thisonly scratches the surface of the challenge of inte-grating semantic features into morphological ana-lyzers.
In the future, it is planned (together withother researchers) to extend the integration of se-mantic features to nouns, adjectives and adverbs.We also plan to model and implement morphologi-cal analyzers for other languages such as German,Russian, Polish and Bulgarian.ReferencesKenneth R.
