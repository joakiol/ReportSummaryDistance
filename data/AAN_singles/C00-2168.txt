The model iscreated with the syntax module of the Boasknowledge elicitation system for a quickramp tip o f  a standard transfer-.basedmachine translation system from \[, intoEnglish.\[ ntroduetlonResource acquisition for NI.P systems is a well.known bottleneck in language engineering.
Itwould be a clear advantage to have amethodology that could provide a nmch cheaperway of NI,I" resources acquisition.
Themethodology should be universal in the sensethat it could be applied to any language andrequire no skilled labour of lm)fossionals.
Ourapproach attempts just that.We describe it on the example of the syntaxmodule of the Boas knowledge elicitationsystem tbr a quick ramp tip of a standardtransfer-based machine tran<;laliori system fromany langnage into English (Nirenburg 1998).This work is a parl of an ongoing projectdevoted to the creation of resources tbr NI,P byeliciting knowledge \[i-on-i intbrnlanis.1 Other Work on Synta)~ Acquisitioni'\]xperinlents in "single -.slop" automaticacquisitioil of knowledge have been amoni~ lhemost lhshional)le topics in NI,I ) over the pastdecade.

"\[hc problerns withthe current fully automatic corpus-basedapproaches include difficulties of maintainingany system based on them, due to theopaqueness of the method and the data to thelanguage ngineer.
At the present time, the mostpromising NLP systems include elements ofboth corpus-based and human knowledge-basedmethods.
One example is acquisition of TwistedPair Grannnar (Jones and ttavrilla 1998) for apair of English and a source language (SL).Another example of a mixture of corpus-basedand human knowledge-based methods is asystem to generate a I,exicalized Tree-AdjoiningGramn-iar (F. Xia et al 1999) automatically fromall abstract specification of a language.
Grosslysin-lplil~/ing and generalizing due to lack ofspace, one can state that these experiments areseldon-i comprehensive in coverage and theirresults ate not yet directly useful iricomprehensive applications, uch as MT.7 Al:quisitim~ of Syntax in Boas2.1 Miethodolo~ies for Selection of SyntaxParametersIn general, tile issue of the selection ofparameters tbr grmnmar acquisition is one of themain problems tbr which there is rio singleanswer.
Parameters applicable to more than onelanguage are studied m the field of languageuniversals as well as lhe principles-and-parameters ap\[)roach (Chomsky 1981) arid itssuccessors ((Tholnsky 1995).
Widely devised asthe ba:ds of universal granlmar, the principles-.and--parameters approach has Ibcused on theuiliversaliiy of coitaill I()rn-ial grammatical i-rileswithin thai particular approach rather on ihosub~tarllive and exhaustive lisl of universalparameters., a subset of which is applicable toeach natural hm,<.~uage., along with lhcii ?l l l lcorresponding sets of values, such as aparameter set of nominal cases.
In some otherapproaches, parameters and parameter values areeither not sought out or are expected to beobtained automatically (e <, Brown et al 1990;Goldstein 1998), and, while holding promise forthe tiittire as a potential component of anelicitation system, cannot, at this time, lbnn thebasis of an entire system of this kind.lit order to ensure uniformity and systematicityof operation of a language knowledge licitationsystem, such as Boas, it is desirable to come tipwith a comprehensive list of all possibleparameters in natural lalguages and, for eachsuch parameter, to create a cumulative list of itspossible values in all the languages that Boascan expect as SLs.
Three basic methodologicalapproaches are used in Boas.Expectation-driven methodology: covering thematerial by collecting cross-linguisticinformation on lexical and grammaticalparameters, including their possible values andrealizations, and asking the user to choose whatholds in SL; while it is beyond the means of thecurrent prqiect to check all extant languages fbrpossible new parameters~ we have includedinfomlation from 25 languages.Goal-driven methodology: in the spirit of the"demand-side" approach to NLP (Nirenburg1996) Boas was tailored lbr elicitation of Mrrelevant parameters rather than any syntacticparameters that can be postulated.
A parameterwas considered to be relevant if it was necessarytbr the parser and the generator used in MT inthe Expedition project (http:/tcrl,NMSU.Edu/expeditiorl/).The parser used is a heuristic clause chunkerdeveloped at NMSU CP,\[, which replaces thecomplex system of phrase structure rules in atraditional '2 erammar and uses language specificinformation, among thent word order (SVO vs.SOV), clause element (sul!ject, o\[!iect, etc.
)marking, agreement marking, nouil phrasestructure pattern, position of a head.l)ata-driven methodology: prtmlpiillg the userby English words and phrases and requestingtranslatioris or othcr rcnderin,,s in SI.
; data-driven acquisition is the first choice, whereverl'easible, because it is the easiest ype of worklbr the userst; In Boas, data-driven acquisition isguided by the resident English knowledgesources.2.2 Types of Syntax Parameters in BoasThe parameters which are elicited through thesyntax module of Boas include 2 what we calldiagnostic and restricting parameters.Diagnostic parameters are those whose valueshelp determine clause structure lbr correctstructural transfer and translation of clauseconstituents.
For example, in languages whichuse grammatical case, the subject is usuallymarked by the nominative, ergative or absolutivecase; direct objects are usually marked by theaccusative case, etc.
\]he list of the currentlyused diagnostic parameters in Boas includes:bask sentence structure parameters: wordorder preferences, grammatical fimctions(subject marking direct object marking, indirectol:tiect marking, complement marking, adverbialrnarking, verb marking), clause elementagreement marking, clause boundary marking,and bask noun phrase structure parameters:POS patterns with head marking, phraseboundary marking, noun phrase componentagreementRestricting parameters determine the scope ofusage of diagnostic parameters.
Some of thediagnostic paralneter values can only occursimultaneously with certain restricting parametervatues.
For exainple, in languages with theergative construction the case of grammaticalsubject is restricted by the tense and aspect ofthe main verb (Mel'chuk 1998).t l{emember: they are not stipposed to be trainedlinguists but are  expected to be able to translatebetween the source language and \['nglish.2Such iraditionally naolphological paramctcr,~ >;part.of speech, number, gender, w)ice, aspect, etc.

The tags for NPs include head andparameter values: The parameter (feature) setconsists of Part of speech, Case, Number,Gender, Animacy arid I)efiniteness (the valuesof the latter two may pose restrictions onagreement of NP components).
Every NP isrepresented in tile Boas knowledge base in thefbmi era  typed feature structure as illustrated bythe following example (the sign "#" inarks thehead):\["a good #boy"-: \[struct.ure:nouz_,--phrase\]\[ "a"- \[pos :determiner,number:sizlgular, root::"a"\]\]\["good"= \[pos : adjective,root : "good" \] \]\["boy"- \ [pos:noun,case:nominat ive 4,number : s ingu\]_ar, an imacy : anilna te,root: "boy", head:l\]\]\]Two kinds of tags are used for sentencetaggirtg tags that t-efi:r to the whole seutenceand tags for clause elen~ents.

Clause elements also inheritsontellce lags.
Senloncos are tagged in Boas asshown by the following exatnple (the 17.

Thefbllowing two examples fiirther illustrate theBoas elicitation procedure.Noun phrase pattern eiieitation.
The user i~given a short deiinition of a noun phrase andasked to translate a given English phraso~ forexample "a Xood  t~r)l' '" into S|.
using tile wordsgiven in a small lexicon of selccled SI, lexicalitems translated Ii'om t'nglisil.
In case of theRussian hmguage tile resuh would be: a good boy1113---> horoshij malchik.
Next, Boas atitomaticallylooks tip every input SL woM in the lexicon andassigns part of speech and feature vahie tags toall the components of SL noun phrases.
Englishtranslations of SL words help record thecomparative order of noun phrase patternconstituents in SL and English and automaticallyassigns the head marker to that element of theSL noun phrase which is the mmslation of theEnglish head.
This is the final result of SL nounphrase pattern elicitation tbr a given Englishphrase.
It includes a SL noun phrase pattern tobe used in an MT parser and a pattern transferinlbnnation for an English generator.
Possibleambiguities, i.e., multiple sets of feature valuesfor one word is resolved actively.
1he modulecan also actively check correctness of nounphrase translations.Clause structure elicitation includes order ofthe words, subject markers (diagnostic featurevalues or particles), direct object markers, verbmarkers, and clause element agreement.
Just likein the case of noun phrases, the user is asked totranslate a given English phrase into SL usingthe words given in the lexicon.
For the Englishsentence used in the example above the Russiantranslation will be:the boy gives a book to his  teacher ---> malch ik  daet knigu uchi te l juAs soon as this is done, Boas presents the userwith English phrases corresponding to clauseelements of the translated sentence, so that forevery English-SL pair of sentences the usertypes in (or drags from the sentence translation)corresponding SL phrases, thus aligning clauseelements.After the ractive alignment is done, thesystem automatically:?
transfers the clause element ags fiomEnglish to SL 5.
* nmrks the heads of every SI, chmseelernent, ando assigns feature values to the heads ofclause elements.STiffs proved to be working in our experiment with I 1langtmgcs, such as French, Spanish, German, Rus-Si;:ill, tJkiliiili.~tll.
Scrbo-Croatian, Chinese, l>crsiurl,Turkish, Arabic, and \[ lindi.assigns sentence restricting parametervalues (clause type, voice, tense andaspect, the last three are ligature valuesof the verb).In the case of assignment of multiple sets offeature values the user is asked to disambiguate .them.
As a result, every SL clause element isnow tagged with certain values of diagnostic andrestricting tags.
The system stores these resultsas mternal knowledge represenmtion, i  the fi, mnof a feature structure, for further processing.
Forexample, tbr the above English-Russiansentence pair the mediate results (not shown tothe user) will be:\["malchik daet kniguuchitelju":\[ s t ructure :sentence ,form: a f f i rmat ive ,  c lause-type :main, vo ice  : active,tense :present,aspect  : imper fect ive  \]\[ "malchik '=\[function: subject, realization : noun--phrase, animacy:animate,head-l, root:'malchik',case:nominative, number:singular,gender:masculir~e, person:third\]\]\["dae~'= \[function:verb,realization:verb, head-root:"davat'",number:singular,person:third\]\]\["kniqu"- \[function:direct-object,realization:noun-phrase,animacy:inanimate, head-root:'kniga',case:accusative, number:singular,gender:feminine, person:third\]\]\ ["uchitel ju"= \[function:indirect-object, realization:noun phrase,animacy:animate, head-root:"uchitel'",case:dative, number:singular,gender:masculine, person:third\]\]\]This data is fiu-ther automatically processed toobtain tile kind of knowledge which can be tisedin tile parser or generator, that is, rules (not seenby the user), where the t l,,"~ht-hand side centaresa diagnostic parameter value (word oMer, clauseelement marking, agreement marking, etc.)
and1114the lefi-lmnd side contains the vahtes ofrestricting parameters which condition the use ofthe COiTesponding diagnostic parameter valtte.
Asample rule for the Russian example above isaslbllows:DirectObjectMarkerl= SL.Ru\].e\[!hs: SentenceForm\[affirmative\]ClauseType\[main\]Voice\[active\]Tense\[present\]Aspect\[imperfective\]Subject\[realization:noun-phraseanimacy:animate\]DirectObject\[realization:noun.phrase animacy:inanimate\],rhs:<:SLDirectObjectMarker\[case:accusative\] :>\];These results are presented to the user forapproval in a readable form?

subject is in nominative case;* direct object is in accusative case;subject agrees with verb in number andperson.After all the sentence translations are processedin this way, the rules with the same right-handside are automatically combined.
At the nextstage of processing the set of values tbr everyrestricting parameter in the right-hand side of thecombined rule is checked on completeness.
Thismeans that in Rttssian in the affinnative mainclause the prelbrred word order is SVO.
