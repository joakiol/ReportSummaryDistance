TEXT PROCESSING OF THAI LANGUAGE=THE THREE SEALS LAW=Shigeharu SugitaNational Museum of EthnologyExpo Park, Senri, SuitaOSAKA 565, JapanAbstractComputer softwares for processingThai language are developed at NationalMuseum of Ethnology,Osaka,Japan.
We usea popular intell igent terminal TEKTRONIX4051 for inputting and edit ing,IBM 370model 138 for KWIC making and sorting,and CANON's laser beam printer for finaloutput.Using these systems,"Kotmai Tra SamDuang"(the Three Seals Law)which con-tains many kind of laws and ordinancesproclaimed in Thai between 1350-1805A.D.
is computerized.
This text has 1700pages and about 1400000 letters.
KWICindex becomes 200000 lines.Some statistical data for this textare obtained.
They are occurrence fre-quency data of single letter,group vowel,and letter combination(digram),etc.AknowledgementsThis report is a result of jointproject at National Museum of Ethnology.The member are Y.Ishii, I.Akagi, S.TanabeY.Sakamoto, S.Uemura, A.Ishizawa,M.Sawamura, K.Sasaki, Y.Kurita, andS.Sugita.
Their research field are eth-nology, l inguist ics,computer science,andsociology etc.We thanks Mr. Sophon Chitthasatcha,Miss Sumalee Maungpaisaln and Miss HiroeMatsumoto for their help in Segmentation,inputting and correction.We also thanks Prof. K.Nakayamaand A.Oikawa of Tsukuba University fortheir support on making Thai letterpatterns and output software for laserbeam printer.IntroductionIn the field of ethnology or cul-tural anthlopology,ethnographies arevery important information sources forcomparative study of many differentsocieties.
Not only bibl iographic databut also contents of text are necessary.HRAF(Human Relations Area Files),which was developed by Dr. Murdock andnow managed by HRAF Inc. at Yale Univer-sity,is a unique retrieval system.They use about 800 category codes bywhich analysts classify the contents ofeach pages of books.Though HRAF system is an elaboratework,it is not easy to search necessarydata by user terms,that is,natural words.If whole text are fed into computer,itis very easy to retrieve any part oftext by the same natural words used inthe text.On-line retrieval system is smartand effective.
But sometimes researcherwants printted index like as KWIC whichis usable at any time and place.
Com-bining KWIC index and thesaurus diction-ary,it gives us a very powerful toolsfor searching special expression hiddenin the text.Till quite recentry,at least inJapan,most cases of computer processingof natural language are distored toindo-europian language or Japanese.
Inthe ethnological studies,we must treatmany areas in the world.
We need comput-er softwares which process unfamiliarlanguages for us,such as Arabic,Korean,Sumerian,Mongol ian,Devanagari ,Thai,etc.National Museum of Ethnology atOsaka has introduced several computersystems to encourage humanity study,andnow is developing many applicationsoftwares which are usable by any re-searchers who do not know computer pro-gramming or how to use computer.This report describes one of suchapplication softwares which treats Thailetters.
The points of our work are asfollows;i) A popular computer terminal is usedfor Thai letter inputting and editing.It is easy to use because dead key oper-ation is not necessary.2) KWIC making and sorting software areimplemented using FORTRAN language whichcan be transfered to any other computersystem.
The algorithm is not so complexbut it was not implemented only becausethey are not popular language.3) Statistical data of the text are ob-tained.
They are occurrence frequencyof single letter,group vowel,and lettercombination.
These data will help us asa contexial data in case of OCR.- - 3 3 0  ?SeqmentationThere is no segmentation problemsin case of indo-europian languages,be-cause they have clear separator for wordunit such as space or comma.
There are,however, many languages in Asia whichhave no clear separator.
They are Korean(Hangul),Chinese,Japanese,and Thai,etc.Examples shown below mean that thereexist several different segmentation.Segmentation affects to the meaning ofsentence and retrieval efficiency.0 ~ - , -O L - r -e L. -~-Fig.l Examples of different segmentationsTo cut into long unit is effortsaving, but it is diff icult to searchthe string included in that unit.
Tocut into short unit is effective forsearching, but too many keywords appear.The text, the Three Seals Law, hasno word separator, as shown in fig.3.So it is necessary to segment into ap-propriate units before making KWIC index.But it is diff icult problem becausesegmentation needs well understandingof meaning, which conversely needs KWICindex.We adopted a practical method whichat first cut into long unit and thencut again after looking KWIC index.I_ RE-'SEGI"IEN TATIOt'~ i--'iInputtingTerminalWe use a popular intell igent graph-ic terminal TEKTRONIX 4051 which hasusual alphabet keyboard.
We sticked Thailetter labels on the side of each key asif it looks like Thai typewriter.
A codetable of Thai letters and corespondingenglish alphabets is shown in Table i.The characteristics of this termi-nal are;i) It generates Thai letter pattern byBASIC program in graphic mode.
User canaffirm the letter he typed.2) It has local cassett memory, so thatuser can input and edit data anytime,even when host computer is not working.3) By way of communication line, storeddata can be transmitted to host computerfor time consuming work.4) It is easy to implement a flexibleThai language editor, which accept al-phabet commands and display Thai letters.5) Copy of screen can be taken by thehard copy unit attached to it.Rules for text inputtingThe text has many irregular expres-sions.
So following expediencies are a-dopted.i) Quotated words or phrases from Palilanguage are skipped by inserting spe-cial symbol to indicate there areskipped words.ORIGIHAL TEXT~EGIENTAT 1014IHPUTTIHGI1700 Pages200000 units1400000strokes\[__zO_RRE, UTION, I Thai editor-----\[ ?TA'T I ST'i CQL DATAM __I.
