Of the top 20 systemproposed protein-location pairs, 18 were inUniProt or supported by online evidence.
In-terestingly, 3 of the top 20 locations identifiedby the system were in the UniProt description,but missing from the formal ontology.1 IntroductionIdentifying subcellular protein locations is an im-portant problem because the protein location canshed light on the protein function.
Our goal is toidentify new proteins, new locations and new pro-tein-location relationships directly from full-textscientific articles.
As with many ontological rela-tions, location relations can be described as a bina-ry predicate comprising two arguments,Location(X, Y) indicates that X is located in Y,such as Location (CIC-5, luminal membrane) fromthe sentence: ClC-5 specific signal also appearedto be localized close to the luminal membrane ofthe intestinal crypt.Identifying protein subcellular locations hasbeen framed as a classification task, where featuresinclude sequences, motifs and amino acid compo-sition (H?glund, et al 2006) and protein networks(Lee et al, 2008).
The SherLoc system (Shatkay etal., 2007) includes text features the EpiLoc system(Brady & Shatkay, 2008) represents text fromMedline abstracts as a vector of terms and uses asupport vector machine to predict the most likelylocation for a new protein.
Classification accuracyvaries between species, locations, and datasets.We take an alternative strategy in this paper andpropose a bootstrapping algorithm similar to(Gildea & Jurafsky, 2001).
The proposed systembuilds on earlier work (Zheng & Blake, 2010) byconsidering a larger set of seed terms and by re-moving syntactic path constraints.2 ApproachThe proposed bootstrapping algorithm is depictedin Figure 1.
The system identifies lexico-syntacticpatterns from sentences that include a given set ofseed terms.
Those the patterns are then used to in-fer new proteins, new locations, and new protein-location relationships.
The system thus requires (a)an existing collection of known entity pairs thatparticipate in a location relationship (called theseed terms) (b) a corpora of texts that report loca-tion relationships and (c) a syntactic path represen-tation.Our experiments use seed protein-location rela-tionships from the UniProt knowledge base(www.uniprot.org).
The complete knowledge basecomprises more than 80,000 protein names for arange of species.
The system uses the location andthe location synonyms from the UniProt controlledvocabulary of subcellular locations and membranetopologies and orientations (www.uniprot.org/docs/subcell release 2011_2).
The system also useda list of protein terms that were created by identify-ing words that immediately precede the word pro-tein or proteins in the TREC collection.
Two-thirdsof the top 100 proteins in the TREC collectionwere used as seed terms and the remaining 1/3were used to evaluate system performance.The system was developed and evaluated usingdifferent subsets of the Genomics Text Retrieval(TREC) collection (Hersh, & Voorhees, 2009).Specifically 5533 articles in JBC 2002 were usedfor development and ~11,000 articles in JBC 2004and 2005 were used in the evaluation.The syntactic paths used the dependency treerepresentation produced by the Stanford Parser(Klein & Manning., 2003) (version 1.6.4).101Figure 1 ?
The Bootstrapping approach used to generate new proteins, subcellular locations andprotein location pairs.
Inferred proteins and locations are depicted with a dashed line.3 ResultsThe system identified 792 new proteins in the firstiteration.
All but 3 of the most frequent 20 proteinswere in UniProt.
All proteins in the test set wereidentified, but only 10 were in the top 100 proteins.The system identified just over 1,200 new pro-tein-location pairs after the first bootstrapping step.We evaluated the twenty most frequent pairs.
Twoerroneous proteins in the previous step caused twoprotein-location pair errors.
UniProt reported 13 ofthe remaining 18 protein-location pairs.
The fiveremaining pairs, were supported by online sourcesand in sentences within the collection.The system identified 493 new locations afterthe second bootstrapping step and we evaluated thetop 20.
Sentences in the collection suggest that 9 ofthe new locations are in fact locations, but that theymay not be subcellular locations and that 8 pro-posed locations are too general.
Interestingly, 3 ofthe top 20 locations identified by the system arementioned in the UniProt definitions, but are notincluded in the control vocabulary as a synonym,which suggests the need for automated approachessuch as this to supplement  manual efforts.AcknowledgmentsThis material is based in part upon work sup-ported by the National Science Foundation underGrant IIS-0812522.
