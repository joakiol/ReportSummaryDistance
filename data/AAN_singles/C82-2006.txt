The LinguAe-t i cs  Research Center  (LRC) at  the Un ivers i ty  of Texan at  Aus-t in  has developed a working machine t rans la t ion  system.
METAL,the ac tua l  t rans la t ion  system, produces qua l i ty  E~l?sh  t rans -la t ions  fo r  German techn ica l  manuals.
Exper iments conductedwith  up to 200 cont iguous pa~es of text  have been most en-cour t !
the LRC p lans  to .have a product ion  system by ear ly1983.METAL i s  a modular system in  which the lex icons ,  grammar,and ana lyzer  are d i s t inc t  packages, each of which may be modi f -ied  without a f fec t ing  the o ther  two.

METAL employs monol ingual  lex icons  fo rboth the source and ts~get  languaKes,  and b i l ingua l  lex iconsto equate each source language word' with a cor respond ing  ta r -get language equ iva lent .
The bi l in~pA~ or " t rans fer "  lex iconspermit  a word in  the source language to be t rans la ted  in to  an~of var ie ty  of words in  the ta rget  language depending on nuanc-es of gre~mat ica l  context .
The lex icons  e.re feature -based ,cons is t ing  of a ser ies  of syntact i c  and semant ic  features  andva lues  fo r  each lex ioa l  ent ry .

This sectionwill conclude with a discussion of METAL transformations andof the case frames mechanism, which is used to disambiguatestrings.Sample TranslationTo illustrate the operation Of the linguistic componentwithin METAL, the paper will then examine some significantsteps involved in the analysis and synthesis of a German sen-tence.
This examination will point up some of the typicalproblems in German - English machine translation, and thesolutions used in METAL.
