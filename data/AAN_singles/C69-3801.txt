A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO MACHINE TRANSLATIONFROM CHINESE TO ENGLISH- Ching-Yi  Dougherty -Heri l l  Col legeUnivers i ty  of Cal i forn iaCal i forn ia  95 060 USAChinese machine t rans la t lon  can be achieved by organ iz ing  a l lthe  necessary  l lng~is t i c  data  in such a way that  the  computer cancompare and re t r ieve  them in the most economical  way.
We areconstant ly  reminded that  the  s torage  space in the  co~uter  i sl im i ted ,  and the  process ing  t ime is  expens ive .
We mmst aim at  thee f f i c iency  of  the  system wi thout  sacr i f i c ing  accuracy .Five types  of l ingu is t i c  data have to  be s tored  in the  computerbe fore  a t rans la t ion  can be rendered:  (1) a Chinese to  Eng l i shd ic t ionary ,  (2) Chinese syntact i c  ru les ,  (3) syntact i c  convers lonru les  from Chinese s t ruc ture  to  Eng l i sh  s t ruc ture ,  (4) Eng l i shmorpholog ica l  ru les ,  and (5) the text  to  be t rans la ted .
(1) The d ic t ionary  must have the  capab i l i ty  to  d i s t ingu ishautomat ica l ly  the  d i f fe rent  meanings which a Chinese lexeme represents .l~anmn readers  can do th i s  and 8o can the  machine i f  enough l ingu is t i cin fo rmat ion  is  s to red  in the  computer.
To a cer ta in  extent  themeanings of  a g iven lexema can be d i f fe rent ia ted  by i t s  d i f fe rentsyntact i c  funct ions .
For example the  word i means 'one '  when i t18 used as a numeral .
A numeral i8 de f ined  as the  c lass  of  wordswhich is  fo l lowed by a c lass i f ie r ,  a measure,  a co l lec t ive  and apar t i t i ve  noun and o ther  numera ls .
I means 'once '  when i t  i8 usedas an adverb  which i s  a lways fo l lowed by a verb .
Anything e l se  whichi s  not covered  by these  two ru les  w i l l  have to  be l i s ted  in thed ic t ionary  e i ther  as an idiom or as a laxeme with i t s  immediateconst i tuent .
Sometimes a ,,ore re f ined  syntact i c  codes are  neededto  d i s t ingu ish  the  d i f fe rent  meanings of a g iven  verb ,  as in  thecase of  t zuoh  ~.
When i t  i s  fo l lowed by an inan imate  noun, i ti s  t rans la ted  to  'make ' ,  by an abst rac t  noun, i t  i8 t rans la ted  to'do ' ,and  by a human noun, i t  i s  t rans la ted  to  'be ' .
Any o therconst i tu tes  which are  except ions  to  the ru les  w i l l  have to  be l i s tedin  the  d ic t ionary ,  such as tzuoh  ran 'behave ' ,  tzuoh fann ' cook ' ,and tzuoh  show 'ce lebrate  a b i r thday ' .For the  conven ience  of  programming, each d ic t ionary  ent ry .which may be a lexeme, an id iom or a const i tu te ,  has only one syn-tac t i c  code and i t s  respect ive  meaning.
A f te r  a sentence  has beenanal~.eed by the  automat ic  parser ,  the  syntact i c  funct ion  o f  eachlexeme i8 determined .
Together  w i th  the  method of longest  matchin  d ic t ionary  lookup,  the  cor rec t  meaning of  a g iven  lexeme in ag iven  context  can be chosen by the  machine.
(2) The Ch inese syntact i c  ru les  are fo rmulated  in such a waythat  they  may reduce the  ambigu i t ies  in pars ing  to  a minimum.
I t  i sassumed that  in a good sc ient i f i c  wr i t ing ,  tl~e sentences  are  notambiguous and there  i s  on ly  one cor rec t  way of  pars ing  which cancar ry  the  process  to  the  end of the  sentence .
Anybody who has hadany exper ience  w i th  the  automat ic  parser  w i l l  know th i s  goa l  i s3hard to  ach ieve .
Severa l  ways have been found to  reduce the m~bigu l -t ies ,  and probab ly  there  are o thers .One of the  methods i s  to  add more re f inements  to  the  syntact i ccodes.
Semantic e lements  mere in t roduced in the fo rau la t lon  of  thesyntact i c  codes,  so that  the  const i tu tes  must be meaningfu l  as we l lg rammat ica l .
For example:  by adding the human e lement to  the  codes,on ly  the  human nouns can be the agents  of the  human verbs .
I f  aninan imate  noun occurs  before  a human verb ,  i t  i s  l i ke ly  to  be thegoal  ra ther  than the  agent of the  verb .
For fu r ther  re f inement ,the  e lement  of p lu ra l i ty  i s  a l so  added to  the  codes,  so that  on lythe p lu ra l  nouns can be the agents  of p lu ra l  verbs .
There i s  a c lassof adverbs ,  such as i torng * together ' ,  huh sh iang *mutua l ly '  endb i i  t syy  ' to  each other*  usua l ly  p lu ra l i ze  any verb that  fo l lows  them.The second method of reduc ing  ambigu i t ies  i s  to  in t roduce  h igherleve ls  to  the  noun and verb phrases .
There are  ~ive leve ls  of  nounphrases  for  example.
The te rmina l  code i s  ca l led  leve l  1.
When thenoun i s  modi f ied  by an ad jec t ive ,  a noun or an ad jec t ive  phrase,  thenoun phrase  i s  ca l led  leve l  2.
Level 1 or 2 modi f ied  by a numberand a c lass i f ie r  i s  ca l led  leve l  3.
Modi f ied  by e determiner ,  it i sca l led  leve l  4.
When the la t te r  i s  mod i f ied  by a pronoun, a re la t ivec lause  or an appos i t ion ,  i t  i s  ca l led  leve l  5.
The noun phrase ofleve l  5 i s  a c losed  noun phrase ;  noth ing  e l se  can be added to  i t .The const i tu te  IRD ( ind icat ive  express ion)  i s  formed by a c losednoun phrase  and a c losed  verb phrase .
Even i f  the  noun phrasecons is ts  of  on ly  the  te rmina l  code,  th i s  ru le  a l so  app l ies  l inear ly .P lease  see  D iagram I .SE~DD MN UU NH VTH .

The las t  th ing  that  needs  to  be done i s  to  app lythe English morphological rules to the citation forms, so that 'that'is changed to 'those' and 'linguist' to 'linguists' and 'write' '~d 'to 'wrote 'The structures of many Engl?sh phrases are not the same as thoseof the Chinese phrases .
In cases  l i ke  these ,  some syntact i c  conver -s ions ,  in the forms of permutat ion,  add i t ion  or de le t ion  are needed.The fo~lowin~ examples will illustrate the logic on the basis ofwhich the syntactic conversion rules are formulated.The verb phrase which consists of a prepositional phrase anda main verb calls for a simple permutation in the conversion.
Thecode for such a verb phrase is VI*R (or VIHtR if the human elementis added) where * indicates that a conversion is needed aud R indi-cates that the conversion is in the form of permutation of the twoconst i tuents .VIH*R V IH*~ND2 vIH2 ~----- / \\ /WH NB3 WD NKdo one thing for motherThe arrow (used in the sense of programming language)  ind icateswhere the  convers ion  occurs .

The tab le  of const i tu tes  resu l ted  from theautomatic parser consists of three columns: the array of the constitutes,the array of the left constituents and the array of the right constitu-ents.
A search through the array of the constitutes, the computerwill know where and what conversion rules are, to be applied.

Very fre-quently the different English translations point out the fact thata given Chinese lexeme represents different meanings in differentcontexts.
A closer analysis of the contexts will reveal that theconditions which produce the same translation are usually consistent-ly similar.The two sub-classes of NDE and NNDE are not sufficient to differ-entiate the various meanings de represents.
Further refinements haveto be made within each subclass of NDE or NNDE.
The following pairs(NDE and NNDE) of conversion rules will illustrate this point.
(a) Possession The meaning of possession is represented byde in Chinese and 's  in English when they are preceded by animatenouns, especially human nouns,and pronouns.
Both the adjectiveand the nominal forms can be converted the same way.2 NB2/ \ \NH DE NB NH 'S NB,~ ~- ~,~ r~,~, student 's problemFor example:VIZ~DE*P  / \~ NH DEVIZ/ \ s  VC , NHbe student ts11(b) Part of a whole When de is preceded by an inanimate nounor an abstract noun, it represents the meaning 'part of a whole' whichis  usual ly  t rans la ted  to 'o f '  in Engl ish.
For example:NB*R NB*RNN DE NB NB OF NNVIZ VIZNNDEO* R NNDEO* RVC / NN DE VC ONEOF NN~ ~ ~?
be on~ude~of woodIf the class of bin only includes material nouns, such as cloth,wood, metal and others, then the DE can be replaced by ONE MADE OF.Otherwise it can only be converted to ONE OF.
(c) A connective which represents no meaning When de ispreceded by an ad jec t ive ,  i t  has no meaning.
Therefore i t  isdeleted in the conversion.NB2 NB2~ D ~ ~  *~vV~ DE NB VQ NBsimple problem(e) The one that  In a nominal phrase, the de represents  theone which is modified by whatever is the left constituent, and itcannot be deleted.12VIZ VIZNNDE*Y NNDE*Y/ ~ / \ \VC ~ DE VC V~ ONEhe , imple one(f) A translated syntactic connective The de connects a verbphrase to a noun represents no meaning, but it has an English equiva-lent in the form of a relative pronoun.
The case of the pronoundepends on the constituent that precedes the de.If the verb phrase consists of an intransitive verb phrase,the noun that the NDE modifies, or the NNDE implies is the subjectof the verb phrase.
For example:NH* R NH* RVI2N~ER<R ~ ~ ~ / ~ER*R\  VI2/ \  .

They may be where, which or when depending on their antece-dents.
In order to make the computer to choose between where, who,which and when, more re f inements  have to  be in t roduced  to  thecodes of h igher  nodes.I f  the  verb  phrase be fore  the de cons is ts  of a sub jec t  (or  agent )and a t rans i t i ve  verb ,  the  noun that  the  NDE mod i f ies  and the  NNDEimpl ies  i s  the  ob jec t  of the  verb phrase .
For example:Nl'I* R NI~R // \NR vr DE NH NH WHOM NR VT:~ ~.

I t s  convers ion  ru lei s  the  same as that  for  the  in t rans i t i ve  verb phrase .Of the  mi l l i ons  of  de phrases ,  ten  convers ion  ru les  are  su f f l -c ient  to  d i f fe rent ia te  the  many meanings that  d_~e represents ,  and rendera rough but  adequate  t rans la t ion .

Some of  the  so lu t ions  can bewr i t ten  in to  the  d ic t ionary ,  and some, incorporated  in to  the  syntact i cconvers ion  ru les .
A great  deal  of  research  have been done in th i sa rea ;  the  main problem i s  to  implement he in fo rmat ion  to  theex is t ing  system.

The per iod  i s  usedto  te rminate  a sentence ,  any o ther  usage of the per iod ,  such asmarking the  end of  a sub- t i t le ,  shou ld  be e l iminated .
Otherwiseevery  sentence  can be nomina l i zed  by the automat ic  parser .With some knowledge of PL / I ,  I am tempted to  say that  machinet rans la t ion  from Chinese to  Eng l i sh  i s  not only  poss ib le ,  i t  is  a l soeasy  to  program.
A program can be wr i t ten  to  read the d ic t ionary ,the  syntact i c  ru les  and the text ,  parse  the  sentences  and s torethe  const i tu tes .
The program searches  through the ar ray  of const i tu tesfor  the  symbol of *, and then per forms the syntact i c  convers ions  asind icated  by the codes  that  fo l low the *.
Once th i s  i s  done, therprogram ret r ieves  the  const i tuents  of each  const i tu te  unt i l  theconst i tuents  are the  te rmina l  laxemes?

Now the meanings ofa g iven  lexeme can be d i f fe rent ia ted  in terms of i t s  context .
Withmore soph is t i ca ted  l ingu is t i c  data  of both source and ta rget  languages ,more e f f i c ient  prograu~ing language,  and b igger  and fas ter  computers ,machine t rans la t ion  can be a rea l i ty  in the near fu ture .
