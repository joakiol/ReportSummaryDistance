The state of computer alchemy, how-ever, is such that one can profitably examine what has been done withcomputers as aids in the study of Amer ican  English dialects.Purpose .This paper will sketch the development of computer procedureswhich have been used in the analysis of regional Amer ican  Englishoutside of literary contexts, It will note that lists of words and phra-ses have grown in complexity of count, and that some larger unitsof spoken sentences are being described .
Having shown what has beendone, it will suggest additional uses of the computer in preparingclearer displays of local variations in usage.ZCollecting techniques.If dialectology, defined broadly, is the collection and analysisof natural speech in a cornrnunity, then Amer ican  dialectology hasgone about this endeavor is three or more  ways.
One  is to conducta controlled interview during which the investigator, guided by en-tries on worksheets,  asks questions and writes the informant's re-plies in a phonetic script.
3 A second, based on data collected by thefirst procedure,  is to give an informant a printed questionnaire andask  h im to encircle those words  which he actual~y uses and to leaveunmarked  those which  are foreign to his habits.
A third, seeking toobtain only pronunciation, asks the informant to read a set passagealoud in his normal  speaking voice~ 5 And  the last one to be namedasks a speaker to look at a set of numbered  pictures and to say some-thing about them;  his remarks  are recorded by means  of a tape re-corder and are transcribed later .6, 7Anal____.ysis and  pub l i ca t ion .The  mid - twent ie th  century  marks  a tu rn ing  po int  in the sor t ingand  pub l i ca t ion  of data  about  spoken  Amer ican  Eng l i sh .
Manua l  workwas  requ i red  in the ent i re  p reparat ion  of a 1949 s tudy  of the vocabu-la ry  of the At lant i c  communi t ies  and  of a para l le l  s tudy  of p ronunc ia -t ion  there  - -  the la t te r  pub l i shed  in 1961.
B, 9 Between those  datesAtwood in Texas  and  Wood in  Tennessee  had  begun to punch  the i r  l i n -gu is t i c  data  on  cards  for  la te r  mach ine  sor t ing ,  count ing ,  and  pub-l i ca t ion .
10, 11 Compar i sons  of the tab les  in Kurath  (1949) with thosein Atwood (196Z)  wi l l  show that  whi le  both  works  l i s t  a common re -g iona l  vocabu lary ,  the Atwood s tudy  shows  an inc rease  in the prec i -s ion  of measurements  of occurrence.
These  calculations and the mul -tiplicity of tables showing gradation in word  choice among age groupsare a reflection of Atwood 's  use of computers .P rob lems in transcription.If the researcher  employs  a printed questionnaire, he has no dif-ficulty in converting those words  chosen and conventionally spelledinto acceptable punched entries which will emerge  in the same spell-ing in a printout.
But  if he has made a phonetic transcription or if hehas a tape recording as his basic doqurnent, then he faces a varietyof p rob lems in preparing the document  for computer  analysis.
Whi lescience fiction , reversing the computer  processes which generateartifi~zial speech, imagines a computer  that can read a voice tape ,transcribe it into its proper  regional representation, and compare  itwith tapes f rom other dialects, fact requires linguistic researchers3to t ranscr ibe  the  documents  w i th in  the  l im i ts  of  key  punch  conven-t ions  o r  o ther  res t r i c t ions  that  app ly .Le t  us  cons ider  the  prob lems o f  a researcher  who  i s  us ing  asbas ic  documents  a g roup  of  tape  record ings  wh ich  have  comparab leun i t s  of  d i scuss ion  s to red  on  them:  1Z Convent iona l  Eng l i sh  spe l l ingpresents  no  prob lem.

Whether  he  i s  t ranscr ib ing  Eng l i sh  o r  someother  language,  he  has  to come to gr ips  w i th  the  d i f fe rences  betweenthe  Roman a lphabet  and  the  In ternat iona l  Phonet ic  A lphabet  wh ichserves  most  of  us  fo r  phonet ic  t ranscr ip t ions  of  speech .

Omiss ion  reduces  the  programming  d i f f i cu l t ies .Word  geograph ies  o f  Amer ican  reg iona l  Eng l i sh  syntax  have  notappeared ;  the  neares t  that  one  comes  to  that  des ideratum i s  a s tudyo f  var iant  verb  fo rms  in  the  At lant i c  s ta tes .

But  le t  us  d i spose  o f  a few other  de -ta i l s  of  ed i t ing  the  spoken  text  be fore  we turn  to i t s  ana lys i s .It does not seem likely that a g rammar  and syntax of Amer icanregional English will emerge  f rom the phonetic evidence.
First, apart of the evidence is missing -- the supersegmental  part for instance.Second, the tedium of preparing and proo/reading the needed amountof text presents an almost insuperable barrier.
As  a consequence,regional English grammar  and syntax will be constructed f rom sen-tences conventionally spelled.The researcher must  establish word  boundaries and decide onthe rr~ust suitable grammar .
Let us assume that he has chosen aslot and filler grarnlnar on the Fries model.
15 His word  boundaries,then, will allow the word  to be put into files in computer  memorywhich correspond to syntactic slots.. That is, the researcher mustdecide what is "one word"  and punch the text accordingly.
If the sourcerecording has woodpecker  and rail fence, as it does, the decisioncan often go either way.
For  computer  purposes it may  be good topresent each as "one word"  in the fo rm WOODPECKER and R~ILFENCE(or if that looks too strange, RA IL -FENCE ).
Conversely, it may  bemore  economical  to present each as't~ro words"  -- WOOD PECKERand RA IL  FENCE.Discovery procedures.Having stored the dialectal evidence in sentences made up ofstrings of conventionally spelled ,words and in segments of phonetictranscription, the researcher must  direct the computer  to look fordetails which characterize that dialect and then to apply the samesearch techniques to hitherto unexamined words, phrases, and sen-5tence  s .The  obv ious  f i r s t  s tep  for  Amer ican  d ia lec to logy  is  to searchcomputer  memory  fo r  se lec ted  words  wh ich  have  been used  to iden-t i fy  the major  d ia lec ts  of  that  language a long  the At lant i c  seaboard .I f  one has  used  a pr in ted  quest ionna i re ,  some words  wi l l  be s toredin memory  wi th  an  ind icat ion  that  no one chose  them;  if, on the o therhand,  one has  used  a d i rec t  in terv iew procedure ,  he wi l l  have  pro -v ided  computer  memory  wi th  no guide to the miss ing  lex icon .
Whenthe computer  is  d i rec ted  to fo l low a concor ;dance  or  l i s t ing  program,it  w i l l  u l t imate ly  repor t  that  f rom the pr in ted  quest ionna i re  0 personschose  awendaw bread  and some ha l f  dozen  o ther  words ,  10 chose  car  -ben  o i l ,  73 chose  doub le  s ing le t ree  ,and  so on Let  us  assume thatthe spoken record had the same numbers  of known choices -- I0 and73, but silence for awendaw bread  ; one cannot conclude that awendawbread is either used or unused  among those informants.
The  avail-able raw evidence, then, helps to shape the mode l  of a linguistic com-munity.The  tabulated responses to a pictorial interview manua l  may givea wider range of local words, hence a different base for the model ,than do other techniques.
For  the dialectally distinctive faucet andspigo____~t, Table 1 provides an illustration of the range of synonymselicited by a picture of a device to control the flow of water.
The  com-puter counted these according to the county in which  each informantwas  living .
In Table I # 1 stands for counties in east Tennessee  andnorth A labama,  and # Z stands for those in central and south A labama.Under  other c i rcumstances this code could stand for young-old, city-country, wealthy-poor, or any other pair that was  pertinent,Table I#1 #ZFAUCET lZ 8SP IGOT 3 4WATER FAUCET 4 3WATER SP IGOT 1 2HYDRANT 1 1WATER HYDRANT 0 1WATER TAP  I 0HANDLE 4 Z6Hand le ,  the las t  word  l i s ted ,  p resents  a recur r ing  puzz le  when thein terv iewer  tu rns  to h i s  tape  record ings .

At  the present t ime it is doneby inspection rather than by computer .
Of course some of the dif-ficulty would disappear if the allophones were  coded as phonemes;this would  reduce five symbols  to two -- E# and I*.
For  a socio-linguist or a dialectologist to do so is to lose details that may be ofgreat importance later.
As  everyone knows, social distinctions areattached to such things a~s the presence or absence of /r/, the sepa-ration of pen f rom pi___~n, and so on.The last stage and the newest  sort of computer  aided researchin dialectology is in the grammar  and syntax of local sentences.
Ashas already been said, computer  research will be directed towardconventionally spelled transcriptions of the spoken sentences.
Andthe grammat ica l  process itself is essentially one of building a con-cDrdanc?.The first sentences concorded are those which have in them thewords  which earlier were  used to identify the local dialects.
Forg rammat ica l  analysis, the whole sentence is much  too long; ratherone selects the two slots on either side of the cnncorded word  itself,The concorded word  is v iewed as a base.

Perhaps  the  one  d i f fe rence  i s  that  Jones  andWeprnan undertook a part-of-speech classification of their data, afirst step toward a grammar  and syntax of spoken English.
Other re-lated first steps have been taken toward the construction of slot andfiller g rammars  of the main  language and a few of its dialects.
Itdoes not se~rnlikely that transformational-generative grammar  willcontribute much to solving the analytical difficulties largely becausethat style of g rammar  is interested in the deep and general str~gturesrather than the surface grammar  found in dialectal variations.As  for applicable computer programs, those that serve in theconstruction of concordances and lists have seemed adequate.
