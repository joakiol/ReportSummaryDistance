The tool is based on a Java SwingGUI and allows the annotators to editnodes and relations in the network, as wellas links between the nodes in the networkand the nodes from the previous layer ofannotation.
The data processed by the toolin this presentation are from the Englishversion of the Wall Street Journal.1 IntroductionCedit is a part of a project to create a rich resourceof manually annotated semantic structures (Nova?k,2007) as a new layer of the Prague DependencyTreebank (Sgall et al, 2004).
The new layer isbased on the MultiNet paradigm described in (Hel-big, 2006).1.1 Prague Dependency TreebankThe Prague Dependency Treebank is a languageresource containing a deep manual analysis oftext (Sgall et al, 2004).
PDT contains three lay-ers of annotation, namely morphological, analytical(shallow dependency syntax) and tectogrammatical(deep dependency syntax).
The units of each annota-tion level are linked to corresponding units from theshallower level.
The morphological units are linkeddirectly to the original text.The theoretical basis of the treebank is describedby the Functional Generative Description of lan-guage system (Sgall et al, 1986).1.2 MultiNetMultilayered Extended Semantic Networks (Multi-Net), described in (Helbig, 2006), provide a univer-sally applicable formalism for treatment of semanticphenomena of natural language.
They offer distinctadvantages over classical predicate calculus and itsderivatives.
Moreover, semantic networks are con-venient for manual annotation because they are moreintuitive.MultiNet?s semantic representation of natural lan-guage is independent of the language being anno-tated.
However, syntax obviously varies across lan-guages.
To bridge the gap between different lan-guages we can the deep syntactico-semantic repre-sentation available in the Functional Generative De-scription framework.2 Project GoalsThe main goals of the project are:?
Test the completeness and intuitiveness ofMultiNet specification?
Measure differences in semantic networks ofparallel texts?
Enrich the Prague Dependency Treebank witha new layer of annotation?
Provide data for supervised training of text-to-semantic-network transformation11?
Test the extensibility of MultiNet to other lan-guages than German3 CeditThe presented tool has two key components de-scribed in this section.3.1 Input/Output processingThe input module of the tool loads XML files inPrague Markup Language (PML) and creates an in-ternal representation of the semantic network, tec-togrammatical layer, analytical layer, and the surfacetext (Pajas and S?te?pa?nek, 2005).
There is also an op-tion to use files with named entity annotations.
Thesentences in this demo are all annotated with namedentities.The XML schema for the semantic network is anapplication of the Prague Markup Language.3.2 Network GUIThe annotation GUI is implemented using JavaSwing (Elliott et al, 2002).
The key features of thetool presented in the demonstration are:?
Editing links between the semantic networkand the tectogrammatical layer?
Adding and removing nodes?
Connecting nodes with directed edges?
Connecting edges with directed edges (i.e., cre-ating relations on the metalevel)?
Editing attributes of both nodes and edges?
Undoing and redoing operations?
Reusing concepts from previous sentences4 Related WorkThere are various tools for annotation of the PragueDependency Treebank.
The Tred tool (Hajic?
etal., 2001), for example, allows users to edit manyPML applications, even those that have never beenseen before.
This functionality is enabled by rolesin PML specification (Pajas and S?te?pa?nek, 2005).MultiNet structures can be edited using MWRtool (Gnrlich, 2000), but this tool is not primarilyintended for annotation; it serves more as an in-terface to tools automatically transforming Germansentences into MultiNet.AcknowledgementThis work is supported by Czech Academy of Sci-ence grant 1ET201120505 and Czech Ministry ofEducation, Youth and Sports project LC536.
