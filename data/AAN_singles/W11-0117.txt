A Representation Framework for Cross-lingual/InterlingualLexical Semantic CorrespondencesYoshihiko HayashiOsaka University, Japanhayashi@lang.osaka-u.ac.jpAbstractThis paper proposes a framework for representing cross-lingual/interlingual lexical semantic cor-respondences that are expected to be recovered through a series of on-demand/on-the-fly invocationsof a lexical semantic matching process.
One of the central notions of the proposed framework is apseudo synset, which is introduced to represent a cross-lingual/multilingual lexical concept, jointlydenoted by word senses in more than one language.
Another important ingredient of the proposedframework is a framework for semantifying bilingual lexical resource entries.
This is a necessarysubstep when associating and representing corresponding lexical concepts in different languagesby using bilingual lexical resources.
Based on these devices, this paper further discusses possibleextensions to the ISO standard lexical markup framework (LMF).
These extensions would enable re-covered correspondences to be organized as a dynamic secondary language resource, while keepingthe existing primary language resources intact.1 IntroductionAs the world goes more global, the demand for multilingual lexical semantic resources has increased.
Acentral approach to realize such a multilingual resource has been nicely demonstrated by the EuroWord-Net (Vossen 2004) and the succeeding it, Global WordNet Grid project1.
In these projects, the goal is tobuild a worldwide grid of wordnets by means of interlingual pivots.
While we may assume that the grid isstatic and stable in its nature, dynamic lexical resources (Calzolari 2008) are possible, provided a varietyof language resources are wrapped as Web services2 and are accessible on a service infrastructure.
Forexample, a virtually combined lexicon3 can be evolutionarily realized by opportunistically associatingsemantically corresponding entries in the relevant lexical resources.However, existing frameworks for modeling and representing lexical resources are not applicableto this new type of lexical resource in their current configurations.
For example, while the ISO lexicalmarkup framework (LMF)4 provides useful constructs to represent a range of lexicons, it still concen-trates on modeling one lexical resource at a time, and does not provide effective devices to integratedifferent types of lexical resources into a single combined resource.
This has motivated us to developa framework for representing cross-lingual/interlingual lexical semantic correspondences that may berecovered through a series of on-demand/on-the-fly invocations of a lexical semantic matching processthat underlies combined lexicon access services.The central concept of the framework is the notion of pseudo synset, which is introduced to repre-sent a cross-lingual/multilingual lexical concept, jointly denoted by words in more than one language.As the name implies, it inherits and extends the constituting principle of wordnets: a lexical concept is1http://www.globalwordnet.org/gwa/gwa grid.htm2We use the term servicize to mean the wrapping of a static language resource as a dynamic Web service, which provides astandardized application program interface (API).3Hartmann(2005) discusses a range of hybrid dictionaries, which includes, for example, monolingual cum interlingualdictionary.4Standardized as ISO 24613:2008.155defined as a set of synonymous word senses.
Another component of the proposed framework is a frame-work for semantifying bilingual lexical resource entries, which is a necessary substep for associating andrepresenting corresponding lexical concepts in different languages by using bilingual lexical resources.This paper starts with a motivating example and a look at how to represent the abovementioned com-ponents in the example.
This paper then discusses possible extensions to the ISO LMF, which wouldenable recovered cross-lingual/interlingual correspondences to be organized as a dynamic language re-source.
This dynamic resource is secondary, because it is created on top of the existing primary languageresources.
Here it should be noted that this secondary language resource can be enriched and expanded,gradually evolving in a collaborative Web service environment.2 A Motivating Example and RepresentationsFigure 1 shows our motivating example, depicting five direct cross-lingual lexical semantic correspon-dences: a Japanese word kawa can be translated into either river or stream in English; river is associatedwith either of rivie`re or fleuve in French, depending on where the river flows into; stream is associatedonly with rivie`re in French.	  	Figure 1: Motivating Example.Situations similar to this one would be brought about, for example, by invoking a lexical accessservice on a Web-based linguistic service infrastructure.
More specifically, think of a dictionary servicethat implements a virtually combined dictionary.
One user of this service might like to find the meaningof the Japanese word kawa (by consulting a Japanese lexical semantic resource) and then want to knowthe equivalents in English (by consulting a bilingual dictionary); another user may want to look forFrench counterparts of river.
To fulfill these requirements, a computational lexical semantic matchingprocess behind the dictionary service should be invoked in an on-demand and on-the-fly manner, if therelevant cross-lingual semantic correspondences are unknown to it.
These invocations of the matchingprocess can induce possible indirect lexical semantic correspondences: for example, between kawa andrivie`re, via river.2.1 Problems with a Possible LMF RepresentationThe LMF NLP multilingual notation extension (Francopoulo et al 2009) is devised to model and repre-sent lexical semantic correspondences across languages.
We can use this device to model and representthe situation in the motivating example, as shown in Fig.
2, which makes use of the Sense Axisconstruct.
Actually, this figure has been created from a figure presented in (Francopoulo et al 2009) byadding the following: a Japanese Sense node associated with kawa; an English Sense node associatedwith stream; and a Sense Axis node that links the Japanese Sense node to the two English Sensenodes.
Although this configuration seems to be natural, several questions may arise, including:?
How can we represent an indirect correspondence that could be dynamically derived or inferredfrom a combination of direct correspondences?
For example, should the derivable indirect corre-spondence between kawa and fleuve also be represented by adding the Sense Axis and SenseAxis Relation constructs?
Or should we introduce another Sense Axis node, which, asan interlingual pivot, aggregates all the corresponding senses?156	 			 	Figure 2: Straightforward LMF Representation of the Motivating Example.?
How and where should the details of a matching process be encoded?
This is particularly crucialfor a dynamic resource, so that the potential user is able to assess the reliability of the resource.?
Is the introduction of the Sense Axis Relation instance with the label ?more general?
nec-essary or adequate?
The LMF specification states that a Sense Axis Relation instanceshould be introduced if the correspondence is not direct (partially equivalent).
However, in ourscenario, it is reasonable to expect that the lexical semantic relation between rivie`re and fleuve hasalready been encoded somewhere in an existing French lexical semantic resource.
This suggeststhat the introduction of the Sense Axis Relation might be redundant.2.2 Proposed Representation: OverviewFigure 3 shows the conceptual overview of the proposed representation for the motivating example inconsideration of these questions.
In this representation, we have eight nodes, each depicted by a shadedround rectangle node.
Each of these nodes is classified as a cross-lingual pseudo synset (CP Synset)node (marked by a number) or a multilingual pseudo synset (MP Synset) node (marked by a Greek let-ter).
While the former represents a directed cross-lingual correspondence between two senses, the lattershows a set of multilingual word senses that may share an intersectional concept across the languages.For example, the CP Synset node labeled ?1?
represents a concept denoted by senses of kawa andstream, along with the depicted direction.
The node marked ?
indicates a concept jointly denoted by themultilingual sense set: {kawa, stream, rivie`re}.  jwn ewn fwnFigure 3: Conceptual Overview of the Proposed Representation for the Motivating Example.Given the previously mentioned use case scenario, we presuppose that two types of lexical resourcesalready exist, and that they are made accessible by appropriate Web service interfaces:?
Three WordNet-type monolingual lexical semantic resources for Japanese (jwn), English (ewn)and French (fwn) are assumed.
We assume that they are modeled and represented using the LMFNLP semantics extension.157?
Although not explicitly depicted in this figure, two bilingual lexical resources for Japanese-to-English (j-to-e) and English-to-French (e-to-f) are assumed.
They are assumed to be mod-eled and represented by employing the LMF machine readable dictionary (MRD) extension.
How-ever these resources would be augmented externally by the semantification mechanism describedin the next section.As we will see later in this paper, derived correspondences between/among the existing lexical re-source elements should be organized as a kind of secondary language resource in order to be reused.3 Semantifying Bilingual Lexical Resource EntriesThe semantification of a bilingual lexical resource entry is a necessary substep when associating possiblycorresponding lexical concepts in different languages.
In principle, the source language (SL) expression(entry word) is first associated with a sense in an SL lexical semantic resource.
Then, we seek a possiblecorresponding sense for the target language (TL) expression (translation equivalent) in a TL lexicalsemantic resource.
This process enriches the bilingual lexical resource by grounding it in the lexicalsemantic resources in the SL and TL.3.1 Necessity of SemantificationBilingual dictionaries provide lexical items in one language with counterparts in another language thatare similar in meaning and usage.
However, although this definition is fairly straightforward, bilingualdictionaries do exhibit problems that need to be addressed, mainly owing to differences in concept for-mation in different languages (Svense?n 2009).
Although the idea of using bilingual lexical resourcesto integrate semantic resources is not new, as demonstrated by Daude?
(1999) or Chen (2002), bilingualdictionaries, in general, have attracted less attention than monolingual dictionaries.
As pointed out byFontenelle (1997), this may, in part, be owing to their less structured machine-readable data format,making it harder for a researcher to mine useful information from bilingual resources.
However, a stan-dardized modeling framework such as the ISO LMF can enable more bilingual lexical resources to bedisseminated in a well-structured format.
The LMF introduces the MRD extension to provide a meta-model to represent monolingual/bilingual dictionaries that are primarily compiled for human use.   Figure 4: LMF MRD Class Model.Figure 4 provides an overview of the LMF MRD extension in a UML diagram.
It shows that thetranslation equivalents in the TL for an entry word in the SL are represented by using Equivalentnodes, each of which is associated with a Sense node of the Lexical Entry node.
The figurealso shows that a translation equivalent is represented by an instance of Text Representationclass, which basically carries a text string that may be annotated with linguistic data categories.
Thissimple and somewhat unstructured configuration is reasonable and can be acceptable, given the factthat most bilingual resources are structurally messy.
However, the configuration may be insufficient if158we are to exploit a bilingual dictionary as a kind of semantic resource and leverage it as a bridge toassociate potentially corresponding lexical concepts in different languages.
This motivated us to developa framework to semantify bilingual lexical resources.3.2 Framework of SemantificationFigure 5 shows the process of semantification.
It is noteworthy that before the semantification, thebilingual lexical entry is represented according to the definition in the LMF MRD extension.		EquivalentSenseLexicalEntryewn	CP_SynsetSL_Sense_Grounding	e-to-fSynsete-to-f	 	Figure 5: Example of Semantification of a Bilingual Dictionary Entry.The semantification is as follows:1.
We first perform SL sense grounding to associate the Sense node in the bilingual lexical resourcee-to-f with a Sense node in the SL lexical semantic resource ewn.
To accomplish this, acomputational lexical semantic matching process first looks for possibly corresponding Sensenodes in ewn.
This process5, is never decisive, even if it makes full use of the information, suchas the entry word itself, a gloss description, or additional semantic markers, provided in the lexicalresources.
Therefore, a human judgment is then necessary to choose among the candidates andestablish a correspondence.
Once the correspondence has been established, the formerly under-specified word sense river.
* in e-to-f is disambiguated as river.ewn.1.
Here ewn.1 isan identifier6 of the Sense node in ewn.
At the same time, these two Sense nodes are interlinkedby an SL Sense Grounding node, as shown in the Fig.
5.2.
Two CP Synset nodes are then created.
For example, the cross-lingual pseudo synset {river.ewn.1,rivie`re.
*} is associated with the upper CP Synset node, indicating that the intersection ofthese two senses denotes a multilingual lexical concept across individual languages.
However,note that the sense rivie`re.
* indicates that it is not yet grounded to a French lexical seman-tic resource, and so the CP synset node is still underspecified.
In the figure, the set markedClosed represents the set of grounded senses, whereas the set marked Open denotes the still un-derspecified senses.
These two sets together define the current status of the multilingual pseudosynset.
It should be noted that the Sense node in the e-to-f dictionary is associated with twoCP Synset nodes.
This is different from the original LMF specification, in which a Sense nodecan only be associated with one Synset node.
It does not matter, however, as the associationsare accomplished only externally, thereby keeping the existing LMF-modeled resource intact.3.
The additional description of the second translation equivalent ?fleuve,?
which is a ?river thatflows into the sea,?
is encoded as the value of the TL addition feature and is stored in the5We are now developing the process, which basically relies on textual overlap (Banerjee and Pedersen 2003).6A rigorous specification has not yet been determined.159CP synset node.
As discussed in the next subsection, additional descriptions in a bilinguallexical resource offer useful information to fill the semantic gap between an entry word and thetranslation equivalents.
This information includes semantic restrictions on the translation equiv-alents, as well as collocational or phrasal equivalents that detail the semantic range of an entryword.
However, to extract the information from an additional description, we need to analyze thepresented translation equivalent appropriately.
This process would be highly resource-dependent,owning to lack of a standardized presentation format.
Nevertheless, a technique to extract differ-entia (O?hara and Wiebe 2004) can be applied, as some of the translation equivalents are given inthe so-called genus-differentia expression pattern.4.
Although it is not depicted in Fig.
5, if necessary, two underspecified TL senses, will eventu-ally be grounded to the corresponding Sense nodes in a French lexical semantic resource.
Thissub-process is called TL sense grounding and is organized in a similar way to that of SL sensegrounding, requiring a computational lexical semantic matching process with human intervention.However it may be a more difficult process, because, in general, translation equivalents providedin a bilingual resource are not well structured and tend to lack rich semantic descriptions.3.3 Dealing with Partial EquivalencesThe method used for creating a CP Synset node should consider the nature of the translation equiva-lents given in a variety of bilingual resources.
Translation equivalence can be classified into full equiv-alence, partial equivalence or zero equivalence (Svense?n 2009).
He points out that this classification isrough, but important, in the sense that it may determine the way in which a translation equivalent ispresented.
Among these, partial equivalence is the most noteworthy, because equivalent differentiationhas to be implemented in the dictionary description in some way, and the relevant information shouldbe extracted and encoded in the computational representation.
The cases of partial equivalence can befurther divided into convergence (neutralization) or divergence.The English-to-French correspondences in the motivating example can be classified as an instanceof divergence.
Another example of divergence is presented by the Japanese word shujin, which, inEnglish, corresponds to host or hostess, depending on the gender of the person7.
This example canbe represented in a similar way to Fig.
5: a CP synset node for {shujin.jwn.1, host.
*},with TL addition ?male?, and another CP synset for {shujin.jwn.1, hostess.
*}, withTL addition ?female.?
These examples show that in cases of divergence, an SL sense is divided intoa set of finer-grained concepts.
Generally, a divergence instance is signalled by the additional descriptionthat specifies the sense or semantic range of a translation equivalent. j-to-e		jwn				Figure 6: Sample Representation of Conversion-type Partial Equivalence.Convergence can be illustrated by the example schematized in Figure 6, in which the Japanese wordani (elder brother) and otouto (younger brother) are jointly associated with the English word brother, inthe sense of blood brother.
Contrary to the divergence cases, a convergence instance may be indi-cated by a phrasal translation equivalent that preserves, or tries to convey, the finer-grained SL meaning.7Actually, the EDR bilingual dictionary (http://www2.nict.go.jp/r/r312/EDR/) presents: ???male??
host?and ???female??
hostess,?
respectively.160To encode the semantic restriction to the entry word in the SL, we introduce the SL addition feature,as shown in Fig.
6.
It should be noted that the two underspecified CP synset nodes would eventuallybe grounded to the same Sense node in an English semantic resource and hence disambiguated andconverged.4 Modeling Cross-lingual/Interlingual Correspondences for Reuse4.1 Overall PictureFigure 7 shows almost the entire representation of the motivating example, providing more detail than thebrief sketch shown in Fig.
3.
Note that the numbered CP Synset nodes are placed at logically identicalpositions to those in Fig.
3.
In Fig.
7, we introduce instances of the class TL Sense Grounding(shaded diamonds): a TL Sense Grounding node is created when the open translation equivalentof an MP Synset node is closed by being grounded to a Synset node in the TL lexical semanticresource.
With this grounding, together with the SL Sense grounding, an entry in a bilingual lexicalresource works as a bridge from an SL lexical concept to the corresponding TL lexical concept via theMP Synset node.	 	e-to-f	fwn	TL_Sense_Grounding 		 	 		 			ewn		jwn 		 		j-to-eFigure 7: Proposed Representation of the Motivating Example.     	 	 	Figure 8: Resulted Lattice-like Structure.To avoid an unnecessarily complicated diagram, Fig.

In this figure, three MP Synset nodes (indicated by Greek letters) are introduced, and linkedto the associated CP Synset nodes.
At the time of writing this paper, the underlying computationalprocess for deriving the indirect correspondences was still under investigation.
However, it is howeverobvious that the process has to properly filter out inappropriate transitivities to avoid the semantic driftacross languages.
Again, this would need human intervention, but this may require that the person hascompetence for all the relevant languages.
Therefore an effective machinery to assist him/her to makejudgments will be necessary.Incremental creation of the MP Synset nodes gradually forms a lattice-like multilingual conceptstructure.
This suggests that our proposed framework is similar to SIMuLLDA (Janssen 2004), which161applies formal concept analysis (FCA) to derive a concept lattice with the words and formal concepts.However, our framework is clearly different in the sense that we propose an LMF-based representa-tion framework, while considering an incremental formulation of a distributed network structure, asdiscussed.4.2 Specifications of the Proposed ConstructsAll in all, we have proposed four classes in this paper: CP Synset, MP Synset, SL Sense Grounding,and TL Sense Grounding.
These classes, which could extend the current ISO LMF, are specified asfollows.?
A CP Synset node is initiated when a lexical entry in a bilingual lexical resource is activated.?
An MP Synset node is introduced when CP Synset/MP Synset nodes are combined to definea multilingual pseudo synset.?
An instance node of the SL Sense Grounding class associates a Sense node of an existingbilingual lexical resource entry with the corresponding Synset node in an SL lexical semanticresource.
In the original LMF, Sense-to-Synset association is direct and does not require anintermediate node.
However, the insertion of an SL Sense Grounding node is necessary torecord the detail of the lexical semantic matching process.?
An instance node of the TL Sense Grounding class associates the translation equivalent of abilingual lexical resource entry with the corresponding TL Synset node, closing the formerlyopen translation equivalent.Central to our framework is the CP Synset and MP Synset classes, which are similar to the LMFSynset class in the sense that an instance of these classes represents a set of synonymous senses.However, the CP Synset and MP Synset classes differ from the LMF Synset class, because aninstance node of the classes gathers synonymous senses across the languages.
The LMF Sense Axisclass is another LMF construct that has something in common with the MP Synset class is.
However,we strongly expect that with the MP Synset class, multilingual correspondences will be incrementallyrecovered and established, while also pointing to the Sense nodes in bilingual lexical resources.4.3 Toward Reusing Recovered CorrespondencesRecovered and established cross-lingual/interlingual correspondences should be made persistent some-where on the Web-based linguistic service infrastructure, so that they can be reused.
In other words, thesecorrespondences should be converted into a sort of secondary language resource.
Just like the SenseAxis class in the original LMF, instances of the CP Synset and MP Synset classes can be aggre-gated in an instance of the Lexical Resource.
In this way, the Lexical Resource instance canindirectly associate the involved Lexicon instances, which are existing primary resources.However, to make this scenario work, the following issues have to be addressed.?
All the nodes and links external to the existing language resources have to be properly storedsomewhere in the infrastructure and made retrievable.
This means that standardized Web APIsthat enable the search and retrieval of the storage have to be provided.?
At the same time, relevant elements of the existing language resources, such as Synset nodesor Sense nodes, have to be indexed and be retrievable externally.
Assigning global identifiers(URIs) to the elements may be a feasible way to do this.
This may also facilitate the servicizationof language resources as exemplified in (Savas et al 2010).1625 Related WorkThis paper discusses a framework for representing a global and distributed lexical semantic network,while presupposing an environment in which a number of lexical resources have been Web-servicized.Given such an environment, (Calzolari 2008) has pointed out the possibility of creating new resourceson the basis of existing resources, and some work in this direction has been published, such as Soria etal.
(2009) and Savas et al (2010).
This line of work is expected to improve further and increase, asWeb-based linguistic service infrastructures evolve and gain popularity.Obviously, another related area of research is lexicon modeling.
Although the ISO LMF will un-doubtedly be used as a solid and shared framework, requirements to its revisions/extensions continueto emerge.
Among them, Maks et al (2008) pointed out that LMF should more explicitly representlanguage-dependent usage and contrasts, and they proposes a model that compromises between the MRDextension and the multilingual extension.
This solution might be reasonable, if we are to represent anexisting bilingual dictionary precisely.
Nevertheless, the solution may not be sufficient to model andrepresent an evolving distributed lexical semantic network, which is a prerequisite for this paper.
Theproblem raised up by Maks et al (2008) is closely related to the issue posed by Trippel (2010), inwhich he states: LMF provides the container for combining such resources of different types, but doesnot merge them into one formalism.
Given this motivation, he presented a formal lexicon model calledLexicon Graph, arguing that the lossless combination of lexical resources could be accomplished.6 ConclusionsPresupposing a highly servicized language resources environment, this paper proposed a representationframework for cross-lingual/interlingual lexical semantic correspondences that would be recovered in-crementally on a Web-based linguistic service infrastructure.
The main contribution of this paper istwofold: (1) the notion of pseudo synset, which is introduced to represent pseudo lexical concepts sharedby more than one language; (2) the framework for semantifying bilingual lexical resources, which allowsbilingual lexical resources to be used as a bridge to associate lexical concepts in different languages.This paper also discussed how the recovered correspondences can be organized as a dynamic secondarylanguage resource, while examining a set of possible extensions to the ISO LMF.For future work, several items need to be pursued.
First we have to extend the representation frame-work to appropriately accommodate verb and adjective concepts, in which more complicated relation-ships among linguistic elements have to be organized.
Second, we plan to work further on the seman-tification of bilingual lexical resources.
In particular, we intend to devise a formalism and mechanismto represent multi-word lexical entries and complicated translation equivalents.
Multi-word expressionsare more frequently observed in bilingual resources compared to monolingual resources; they are usefulto describe the lexical semantic gaps between the languages.
Last but not least, we intend to implementprototype services around some existing lexical resources.
To do this, along with the basic semanticmatching processes, we have to establish an effective workflow that involves human assessors to approvethe recovered cross-lingual correspondences and the inferred multilingual correspondences.
In this re-gard, the notion of a sense pool and the verification process proposed by Yu et al (2007) should be highlyrelevant as a reference.AcknowledgmentsThe author greatly appreciates anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful and informative comments.
