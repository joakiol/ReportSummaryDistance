Proceedings of the Workshop on Lexical and Grammatical Resources for Language Processing, pages 1?7,Coling 2014, Dublin, Ireland, August 24 2014.Paraphrasing of Italian Support Verb Constructionsbased on Lexical and Grammatical ResourcesKonstantinos ChatzitheodorouAristotle University of ThessalonikiUniversity Campus, 54124, Thessaloniki, Greecechatzik@itl.auth.grAbstractSupport verb constructions (SVC), are verb-noun complexes which play a role in many naturallanguage processing (NLP) tasks, such as Machine Translation (MT).
They can be paraphrasedwith a full verb, preserving its meaning, improving at the same time the MT raw output.
In thispaper, we discuss the creation of linguistic resources namely a set of dictionaries and rules thatcan identify and paraphrase Italian SVCs.
We propose a paraphrasing computational method thatis based on open-source tools and data such as NooJ linguistic environment and OpenLogos MTsystem.
We focus on pre-processing the data that will be machine translated, but our methodologycan also be applied in other fields in NLP.
Our results show that linguistic knowledge constitutesa 95.5% precision rate in identifying SVC and an 88.8% precision rate in paraphrasing SVCsinto full verbs.1 IntroductionNLP systems, particularly statistical MT (Brown et al., 1993) need very large corpora in order to pro-duce high quality results.
In less-resourced language pairs, many words may occur infrequently, so theestimation of the word alignments can be inaccurate.
Furthermore, multiword expressions are still a hotpotato area for an MT system either statistical or rule-based (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).A possible technique to resolve all those problems is to generate paraphrases.
Paraphrases are alterna-tive ways of expressing the same information within one or more languages (Callison-burch, 2007).
Thebenefits of paraphrasing are multiple: the unknown words will be reduced, the MT output will be betterunderstandable, the accuracy of the meaning will be the same etc.In MT, paraphrases help to create a more fluent translation and are valuable in the evaluation of MTresults (Zhou et al., 2006).
Additionally, paraphrases encourage the end user to understand better themain idea of a given text and improve the linguistic level of the text in general, because it is better toexpress an idea using a full verb than a support verb that has no meaning and a noun.In this paper, we focus our discussion on paraphrasing Italian SVCs and we propose a computationalmodel for producing monolingual paraphrases.
The sentence (1) is an example of a SVC, while thesentence (2) is its paraphrase.
The sentence (1) consists of a support verb (fare) ?make?
and a noun(viaggio) ?trip?
that is the head of the sentence.
In sentence (2) we observe that the SVC is replaced by averb, which is the verbal form of the noun.
Hence, the SVC of the sentence (1) semantically correspondsto the full verb of the sentence (2).1.
Mario fa un viaggio negli Stati Uniti d?America.
?Mario makes a trip in the United States ofAmerica.?2.
Mario viaggia negli Stati Uniti d?America.
?Mario travels in the United States of America.
?To generate this type of paraphrases, we use semi-automatic methods.
On the one hand, the result willbe improved and the whole procedure does not take long time to create the linguistic resources.

Section 2 represents the past related work on paraphrasing.
Section3 describes the theoretical background on SVC and Section 4 the linguistic resources and tools usedfor creating the module.
In Section 5, we state our method, explaining step-by-step how the SVC areidentified and paraphrased, as well as the obtained results in Section 6.
Finally, Section 7 concludes anddiscusses our work.2 Related workIn literature, there are many published studies about paraphrasing SVCs.
Research methods range frommanual linguistic and lexicographic work to automatic NLP-oriented studies.
Related work on para-phrasing includes MT, Question Answering, Information Extraction and Text Mining, Summarisationetc.On the automatic side Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) use statistical methods in order to acquireparaphrases that will improve the MT output.
They use bilingual corpora for extracting the monolingualparaphrases by pivoting through phrases among the two languages.
According to their method, if theX is an English phrase and Y its Italian paraphrase and T another possible paraphrase of Y, then, T isequal to X, so it is the paraphrase of X.
Other studies (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003)have used monolingual parallel corpora, such as translations of classic novels in order to automaticallygenerate the paraphrases.Dictionary and ruled-based paraphrasing is less popular because it requires linguistic knowledge andtime.
However, Bareiro and Cabral (2009) present ReEscreve, a system that generates monolingual (inPortuguese) paraphrases using resources from OpenLogos MT system.
Even if OpenLogos is an oldMT system its lexical resources, grammatical rules and syntactic-semantic ontology (SAL) (Scott andBarreiro, 2009) can be applied in many fields in NLP.
Other dictionary approaches that can be alsoused for paraphrasing are WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998; Green et al., 2001) and NOMLEX (Macleod et al.,1997).3 Support verb constructionsSVCs are predicate noun complexes where the main verb has not a strong value (Gross, 1975).
SVCsoccur in many languages, such as Italian.
For instance, in the Italian phrase fare un viaggio the verb fareis semantically reduced.
In Italian, SVC include verbs like dare ?give?, avere ?have?, prendere ?take?,essere ?be?
etc.A semantically weak verb is called support verb (Vsup) (Gross, 1975) or light verb (Polenz, 1963).One of its characteristics is that the predicative noun (Npred) is realised as head of a noun phrase.
Iden-tifying a SVC is not an easy task and several factors should be taken into consideration.
Firstly, theyare not frozen expressions because they can be syntactically splitted by a determiner, an adjective or anadverb.
For example, fare un lungo viaggio ?make a long trip?.
Secondly, there are constructions withthe same structure but they are fake (pseudo SVCs).
For example, fare una banca ?make a bank?
lookslike a SVC but in that case fare?s semantic is not reduced.Given that the meaning of the SVCs is mainly reflected by the nominal predicate, we paraphrase themby replacing the Vsup with a related full verb generated from the predicate noun.
For instance, the phrasefaccio una telefonata a Maria ?make a call to Maria?
can be simply paraphrased as telefono a Maria ?Icall Maria?.
The idea behind this methodology is to pre-process a text that will then be translated by aMT Engine so a better MT output will be archived.4 Linguistic resources and tools4.1 OpenLogosOpenLogos is an open source program that machine translates from English and German into French,Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.
The system was created by Scott in 1970 but then has been extended by2the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).
It is an old rule-based system MT, but itsresources, such as the electronic dictionary, the rules and the SAL which is embedded in the dictionaries,are valuable (Barreiro et al., 2011).In our work we use only the electronic dictionaries including the SAL, in order to implement a modulethat will identify and automatically paraphrase SVCs.4.2 NooJAs mentioned above, our goal is to implement linguistic resources, tools and methodologies that can beused in automatic processing of SVC and in exporting paraphrases.
In this paper, we are presenting onlySVCs that consist of the Vsup fare.The main linguistic tool for recognising and paraphrasing SVCs is NooJ (Silberztein, 2003).
NooJ isa freeware, linguistic-engineering development environment implemented for formalising various typesof textual phenomena such as orthography, lexical and productive morphology, local, structural andtransformational syntax.
It contains several modules that include large coverage lexical resources suchas dictionaries for specific purposes and local grammars that are represented by finite-state transducersfor many different languages.
Its electronic dictionaries contain the lemmas with a set of information,such as:lemma,(1)+(2)+(3)+.
.
.
(4)+.
.
.where (1) corresponds to the category/part-of-speech (e.g.
?Ver?
), (2) to one or more inflectional and/orderivational paradigms (e.g.
how to conjugate verbs, how to nominalise them etc.
), (3) to one or moresyntactic properties (e.g.
?+transitive?
or ?+PREPin?)
and finally, (4) to one or more semantic properties(e.g.
distributional classes such as ?+Human?, domain classes such as ?+Politics?
).Our module consists of specific local grammars and electronic dictionaries in order to recognise para-phrase and translate SVCs, such as fare una presentazione ?make a presentation??
presentare ?present?.In order to process SVCs, we first converted the OpenLogos dictionary into NooJ format.
Each lemmais associated with the category, the inflectional paradigm, the equivalent in English and attributes fromSAL ontology.
There are also some lemmas containing the Greek equivalent that will help for furtherresearch.Figure 1 illustrates a sample of the electronic dictionariy that consists of 75509 entries.
20501 ofthem are nouns (2335 of them are proper names and toponyms), 10910 are verbs, 22193 are adjectives,4621 are adverbs, 151 are conjunctions, 5 are determinatives, 295 are prepositions and 118 are pronouns.14380 over 75509 lemmas are multiword expressions.Figure 1: NooJ electronic dictionary entries.Additionally, for the verbs that can be nominalised we created manually its derivational paradigmand the Greek equivalent.
Applying a derivational paradigm to a given word is possible to change itssyntactic category but not its semantic value.
In total, 78 derivational paradigms were created for 289verbs.
For instance, the affix ?zione changes the verb presentare into the noun presentazione and theaffix ?ata change the verb telefonare to the noun telefonata.
This is extremely important, in order togenerate the paraphrases.
Figure 2 illustrates dictionary verb and noun entries that are linked to SVCwith the support verb fare.Moreover, it was needed to create from scratch inflectional grammars and other syntactic grammars inNooJ format in order to disambiguate the Italian language.3Figure 2: NooJ electronic dictionary entries.5 Automated processing of SVCs5.1 Identification of SVCsTo identify and extract paraphrases for SVCs, we updated OpenLogos dictionaries with morfo-syntactic-semantic information and with derivational and distributional properties as well.
This was necessary dueto new words that were added in the Italian vocabulary in the last years.
We have also created localgrammars that are combined with the electronic dictionaries.We firstly focused on identifying the SVC and updating the existing dictionaries.
We obtained that bydesigning a simple local grammar, that recognises and annotates SVCs and their predicate nouns (seeFigure 3).
The grammar checks for a verb fare followed optionally by a determiner <DET>, adjective<A> or adverb <ADV> and a noun <N>, and annotates it as a SVC (<SVC=+Pred=$N >).Figure 3: NooJ local grammar for recognizing and annotating SVCs and their predicates.We applied that grammar to the Italian monolingual Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) in order to extractthe lemmas of the predicate noun ($N ).
Then, we updated manually the electronic dictionary by addingthe new predicate nouns.
We also associated every new predicate to a corresponding lexical full verb andevery verb with a derivational paradigm (see Figure 4).Figure 4: NooJ concordance after annotation of SVCs and identification of the lemma of the predicatenouns.5.2 ParaphrasingAfter updating the electronic dictionaries, more monolingual paraphrases can be obtained easily.
Figure5 represents a local grammar used to recognise, generate SVCs and transform them into their verbalparaphrases.
The grammar checks for the verb fare in present indicative tense followed by a <DET>, an<A> or an <ADV> and a noun, and generates the verbal paraphrases in the same tense.
Furthermore,we restrict our research to Vsup fare but the same methodology can be apply to other SVCs.
The4same structure follow the grammars created for the other grammatical tenses and moods.
The elements<$V=:fare+PR+1+s>, and $N PR+1+s represent lexical constraints that are displayed in the output,such as specification of the support verb that belongs to a specific SVC.
The predicate noun is identified,mapped to its deriver and displayed as a full verb while the other elements of the phrase are eliminated.Figure 6 shows a NooJ concordance were Italian SVCs are identified and paraphrased as full verbs.Figure 5: NooJ local grammar for paraphrasing SVCs.Figure 6: NooJ concordance for paraphrasing.6 EvaluationWe performed a manual evaluation by judging the precision and the recall of 100 phrases that includethe fare.
We should notice that only 95 of them were containing SVCs while the other 5 contain the verbfare followed by a non predicate noun, hence they cannot be paraphrased.
This test set was extractedradomly from the Italian OpenSubtitles corpus (Tiedemann, 2004).
Table 1 details the evaluation resultsof recognition and paraphrasing of SVCs.
We calculated the results for recognising and paraphrasinggiven that a recognised SVC is not always paraphrased correctly.
We observe that our module canrecognise 86 over 90 SVC that means a precision rate of 95.5%.
Regarding recall, 86 over 95 SVCs wererecognised so, an 90.5% rate was obtained.
On the other hand, a precision rate of 88.8% (80/90) and arecall rate of 84.2% (80/95) were obtained for the generated paraphrases.
The F-measure for recognisingis 92.93 while for paraphrashing is 86.43.According to Bareiro and Cabral (2009), MT performs better when translating full verbs over SVCs.We translated in Google Translate1the same test set both with SVC and its paraphrases and then wecalculated the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) having as reference the English version (with a singlereference translation).
Even if the test set is small for an automatic evaluation, results show an improve-ment of 0.6 BLEU points when we pre-process the data paraphrasing.
In more detail, the obtained BLEUscore for the original test set is 42.76 while for the paraphrased is 43.36.Precision RecallIdentifing 86/90 86/95Paraphrasing 80/90 80/95Table 1: Human evaluation results.1https://translate.google.com/.5The evaluation results clearly show that paraphrasing can improve the quality of MT.
We expect thatthe low recall scores could be higher upon the improvement of the electronic dictionaries and localgrammars.7 Conclusions and OutlookIn this paper, we present a SVC-based paraphrasing framework that uses existing tools and technologiesand hand crafted additions for purposes of increasing translation accuracy.
Our methodology archived aprecision of 95.5% and a recall of 90.5% in identifying and a precision of 88.8% and a recall of 84.2% inparaphrasing.
We also applied our method in a freely available MT system and results show a significantimprovement.To make our paraphrasing methodology more accurate, further analysis and work on electronic dictio-naries is needed.
Especially, we need to work on the pseudo fare SVCs.
Furthermore, our work shouldfocus on paraphrasing SVC with full verb that is not associated to the predicate noun such as fare unasigaretta ?make a cigarette?
?
fumare ?smoke?.
Last but not least, the graphs should be extended inorder to not discard the adverbs and adjectives that are included in the SVCs.
In that case, the MT qualitywill be more accurate.In future research, we are also willing to extend the local grammars and dictionaries in order to gen-erate bilingual paraphrases in other languages such as Greek and English.
For instance, fare una presen-tazione?
to present in English or fare una presentazione?
