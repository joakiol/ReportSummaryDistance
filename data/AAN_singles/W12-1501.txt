Kathleen F. McCoyUniversity of DelawareNatural Language Generation and Assistive TechnologiesAbstractSome people with disabilities find it difficult to access some forms of language.
Assistive Technology is aterm used to describe a class of technologies/interventions designed to enable people with disabilities todo things that their disabilitie currently make difficult.
A large amount of work on Assistive Technologyhas focused on enabling access to language and communication; this class of interventions could greatlybenefit from Natural Language Generation technologies.This  talk  will  briefly  survey  some  Assistive  Technology  applications  that  have  employed  NaturalLanguage Generation technologies ?
highlighting some of the needs in this application area along withthe opportunities that it provides for investigating hard problems in Natural Language Generation.
It willthen highlight a project, called the SIGHT System, intended to provide access to information graphics(e.g., bar charts, line graphs) found in popular media to people who have visual impairments.
This systememploys  Natural  Language Generation technologies to generate appropriate  textual  summaries  of theinformation  graphics.
As  such,  it  makes  contributions  to  several  areas  within  the  field  of  NaturalLanguage Generation while  also enabling access to the information in these graphics to people  whocannot access  it with visual means.BiographyDr.
Kathleen F. McCoy is a professor in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at theUniversity of  Delaware.
She  received  her  PhD from the University of  Pennsylvania  in  1985 with  adissertation in the area of Natural Language Generation, and has been at the University of Delaware eversince then.
Shortly after joining Delaware, she began working in applying Natural Language Processingto  Assistive  technologies  at  the  Center  for  Applied Science and Engineering in  Rehabilitation at  theUniversity of Delaware and the DuPont Hospital for Children.
She served as the Center?s director from2000-2009.
She received a University of Delaware Excellence in Teaching Award in 1997, a Universityof Delaware Excellence in Advising Award in 2001,  and a College of Arts and Science OutstandingAdvisor  Award  in  2003.
From 1995-2008  she  served  on  the  ACL Executive  committee  in  variouscapacities including 10 years as Treasurer.
She is the founding President of the ACL Special InterestGroup on Speech and Language Processing for Assistive Technologies (2011).
She has been an organizerof several workshops on that area associated with various ACL conferences.
She was program co-chair ofthe  User  Modeling  Conference  in  2007,  the  ACM  SIGACCESS  Conference  on  Computers  andAccessibility in 2009, and the General Chair of that same conference in 2011.
She is a Senior Member ofthe ACM.1
