FORMAL SPECIF ICAT ION OF  NATURAL LANGUAGE SYNTAXABSTRACTThe two-level grammar is investigated as a notation for giving formalspecification of the context-frec and context-sensitive aspects of n,~turallanguage syntax.
In this paper, a large class of English declarativesentences, including post-noun-modificatlon by relative clauses, isformalized using a two-level grammar.
The principal advantages of two-level grammar are: 1) it is very e~sy to understand and may be used togive a formal description using a structured form of natural anguage; 2) itis formal with many well-known mathematical properties; and 3) it isdirectly implementable by interpretation.
The significance of the latter factis that once we have written a two-level grammar for natural languagesyntax, we can derive a parser automatically without writing anyadditional specialized computer programs.
Because of the ease with whichtwo-levcl grammars may express logic and their Turing computability weexpect that they will also bc very snitable for future extensions tosemantics and knowledge representation.1.
INTRODUCTIONFormal specifications of natural language syntax should serve as astandard definition for the syntax of the subject language.
Thespecification must be complete, concise, consistent, precise, unambiguous,understandable, and useful to language scholars, users, and implcmentorswho wish to develop a parser for the tanguagc to run on a computer.Furthermore the specification should be mathematically rigorous to thedegree that an implementation of the language can be automaticallyderived from the specification {10\].
Unfortunately many of these aims arcdifficult to accomplish primarily because of the dynanric and informalnature of natural language.
Formal specification is still a worthy goal tothe degree allowed by present knowledge about natm'al anguage and iuthis paper we propose a mctalanguage for specifying both syntax andsemantics of natural anguage that has potential for satisfying these goals.The mctalanguage we propose is the two-levd grammar \[16} (also calledW-grammars and tlgs).
Two-level grammars have been used extensively forspecifying the syntax and semantics of programming languages \[2\] buttheir use in specifying natural anguage was first introduced by the authors\[7, 8, 9\].Existing formal specification mcthods for natural language syntaxtake many forms.
Of these, some of the more common are augmentedtransition network grammars \[181, transformational grammars \[1\], andgeneralized phrase-structure grammars \[5\].
These methods and others arcalso surveyed in \[17\].
The degree to which any formal specification methodsatisfies the above stated goals is sometimes difficult to evaluate and relieson subjectivity.
The authors do not intend to evaluate these existingmethods with respect o the requirements of formal specification languagesbut will instead concentrate on why two-level grammars satisfy thenecessary goals in a mathematically rigorous but readable and easy tounderstand way.
In this paper, the two-level grammar mctalanguage willbe used to define a large classification of English declarative sentences,extending work described in \[8\] and \[9\].
We will emphasize the method ofusing two-level grammars for this purpose and the advantages gainedrather than any particular characteristics of the given grammar.2.
TWO-LEVEL  GRAMMARSA two-level grammar consists of two sel)aratc grammars, themstaproductlon rule~ (metarules) and the hyperrules.
The metarules aregenerally context-free rules which take the form:METANOTION :: hypcrnotion-1; hypcrnotlon-2; ... ; hypernotion-n.where METANOTION is tile left-hand side "nonterminal" symbol of theproduction and hypernotion-1, hypernotlon-2, ... hypcrnotion-n are the nalternatives of the production right-hand side.
Each hypcrnotion consistsof protonotions (terminal symbols) and other metanotions.
In the case ofEnglish, the terminal symbols of the recta-grammar e English words.The recta-grammar itself is used to definc the context-free ~spccts ofEnglish.
Example metarules arc:SENTENCE :: DETERMINER NOUN VERB.DETERMINER :: a; an; tile; these; those; this; that.US ING TWO-LEVEL  GRAMMARBarrett R. BryantDale JohnsonBa lan j  aninat~h EdupugantyDepar tment  of  Computer  and  In format ion  SciencesThe Un ivers i ty  of A labama at  B i rmingbamB i rmingham,  A labama,  U.
S .A .
35294The hypcrrules are of the formhypcrnot\]on ; hyperaltern-1; hyper~ltern-2; ... ; hyperaltern-n.Tile hyperalternatives separated by semicolons arc distinct productionalternatives.
Each of these hyperaltcrnatives may be divided into asequence of hypernotions separated by commas.
In a two-level grammarderivation tree, there will be one br:mch for each clement in the sequeucc.A two-level grammar with either hyperrnles having more than onehyperaltcrnative or two distinct hypcrrules having the same hypcrnotionon the production left-hand side is nondetcrministic.
\[fcach hYl)crrule hasonly one hyperalternative and all hypcrnotions in production left-handsides are distinct from mm another then the tlg is dcterminisl;ic.A hypcrrule is actually a production rule "pattern" since eachhyperrule can possibly represent an infinite number of production rules in acontext-free grammar.
This is because ach occurrence of a metanotion inthe hypcrrulc represents all sequences of protonotions that can be derivcdfrom that metanotion.
That  is, a hyperrule may be viewed as a set ofproduction rules (called strict production rules) in which all metanotionsare replaced by the protonotions they derive.
The only restriction here isthat if there arc more than one occurrcnce of a single rnetanotion, theneach is replaced by the same protonotion sequence in deriving the strictproduction rules.
This is called conMstent substitution.
For example, in thebyperrulcwhere WORD is WOR\])  : true.both occurrences of the metanotion WORD repr~ent the sameprotonotion.
The set of allowable protonotions in this rule is defined bythe metarulcs for WORD.
If these metarules define an infinite number ofpossible protonotions, then tile above hyperrule also represents an infiniteuumbcr of strict i)roduction rules.
\[t is tiffs featurc of two-level grammarsthat allow tbcm to define context-sensitive and recursivcly enumcrablelanguages \[12\].If consistent substitution is not required (or desired) for metanotionswith the same root metarulcs (and nanm), then these metanotions may bedistinguished by subscripts.
For example,where SENTENCE1 and SENTENCE2 are correct ;where SENTENCE1 is corre, ct, where SENTENCE2 is correct.In this hypcrrule, SENT:ENOE1 and SENTENCE~.
are defined by thesame metarulcs (and root mctanotion SENTENCE} but need not have thesame instantiations.Some hypcrrules called predicates act as conditions which must besatisfied for the derivation to be :~uccessful.
A predicate begins with theword where or coadition and the terminal derivation of the hyperrule isthe empty string if the condition is satisfied and will derive a "blind alley"(i.e.
not derive any terminal string) if the condition is not satisfied.
In tiretwo-level grammar of English presented in this paper, all hyperrules arcpredicates and serve to perform context checks such as subject-verbagreement, object~vcrb agreement, and any additional required contextcheeks which cannot be conveniently specified by a eontext-frce grammar(i.e.
tile mctarules).3.
METARULES FOR ENGLISHTile metarulcs of the two-level grammar for English define tirecontext-free a~pccts of English synt*Lx.
Some lexical items from English cannot be easily defined in a forinal way (i.e.
using context-free rules).
Theseinclude tile nouns, verbs, adjectives, proper names, and titles, given namesand surnames for people which arc lcxical categories containing a largenumber of elements.
The formal specification of these categories would beproduction rules of tlm form:NOUN :: aardvark l  abacus; ...; zucchlnLVERB :: abandon; abate; ...; zoom.ADJECTIVE :: abdominal;  abhorrent i  ..4 znhcd.PROPER_NAME :: Aberdeen; Abilenc; ...; Zambia.TITLE :: Admiral;  Archblslmp; ...; Warrant  Officer.For simplicity we choose to omit more formal specifications of the abovecategories.
A more complete list of words in these categories may bc foundin \[14\].527The metarules in our two-level grammar illustrate tile specific subsetof English grammar defined in this paper.
The subset includes declarativesentences with the subject noun premed;fled and postmodilled, includingpostmodification by relative clauses.
The choice of this subset is ratherarbitrary since we have used two-level grammars to define a wide varietyof English sentences (e.g.
in \[7\], more extensive modification is allowed andalso compound sentences).
This subset will serve to illustrate the power oftwo-level grammars for the purposes of defining English syntax.
Becausethe notation for metarules follows context-free grammar conventions usingnatural anguage vocabulary, our recta-grammar is fairly self-explanatory.The rules of English syntax that have been incorporated into our grammarare based on English grammar rules given in \[3\], \[11\], \[131, and \[19\].We now enumerate the metarules used in our two-level grammar ofEnglish.
A scntence consists of a noun phrase and a verb phrase.
Thenoun phrase consists of an optional sentence modifier such as a "viewpoint"adverbial and a subject sequence.
The subject sequence consists of twomain subjects, separated by the coordinator and.
The main subjects maybe either a list of nouns premed;fled and postmodified or a proper namepremodificd by a restricter.1.

Themodifier is a determiner optionally followed by a list of possessive nouns,an adjective, a sequence of nouns, another list of possessive nouns and adenominal noun.
Examples of this type of construct include "themurderer's empty black pistol" and "a very rich man's thick wallet."
Forcontext-sensitive purposes, the determiners are divided into "universal"determiners which may precede both singular and plural nouns anddeterminers which may only precede singular nouns.
Furthermore, acontext-frcc restriction of the pro-noun-modifiers is that thcrc can be atmost one list of possessive nouns in a sequence.
For convenience we chooseto enforce this condition in the hypcrrules instead of the metarules.33.

HYPERRULES FOR ENGL ISHThe hyperrules of tile two-level grammar for English define thecontext-sensitive aspects of English syntax which can not be specified bythe context-free rules ef the recta-grammar.
Unlike the meta-grammar, thehyperrulss do not generate any part of the English sentence.
They serveonly to verify the context-sensitive conditions of the grammar.
This isdone by using predicates ,~ described earlier.
Predicates wil lderive theempty string if they are satisfied and will derive nonterminal strings ofuseless symbols otberwise.
The notim~ that tile hyperrulcs will notgenerate any terminal str ing but instead verify context-sensitive eonditionsof a terminal str ing already generated by the context-h'ee mctarules is annique feature of our approach to designing two-level g rammars  (e .g .
incontrast, see \[2\]).
This  will greatly simplify parsing two-level g rammars  aswe will see later.We will define two types of predicates.
The first of these will bepreceded by the protonotion condit ion and will be given explicitly in theformal grammar.
As with the recta-grammar,  however, there will be somerules which can not bc precisely defined in the formal system.
These rulesrelate to qualities of the unspecified lexical elassc~ (e.g.
nouns, vm'bs, etc.
)and will be designated by the protonotion where.
For exalnplc, thehypernotions where NOUN is s ingular ,  where VERB is past  partlelple,and where NOUN and VERB agree in person and number  call not bcprecisely defined except by a very large number of formal rules such msthose given below:where aardvark  is s ingular  : EMPTY .where abandoned is past  part ic iple I EMPTY .where Adam and ere agree in person and number  : EMPTY.In the subseqnent discussion of hyperrules we will use the not, ation Ituto denote hyperrule number n. The start  hypcrrule ( I l l )  of the two-levelgranunar is:1, SENTENOE : condit ion SENTENOE is a well- formed sentence.This hyperrule has as its s tar t  notion an English sentence which is well-formed with respect to the context-free rules or the recta-grammar formetanotion SENTENCE.
The next hyperrule (H2) expands the sentencewith respect to what  conditions must be satisfied.
The formalization ofthese is self-explanatory.2.

We first give the hyperru\[es which enforcecorrect premodification.
Premodif ieatiml (H13) requires 1) correctdeterminer usage (i.e.
with respect to singular and plural nouns) and 2)any prcmodifying nouns must be singular or "mass" nouns (i.e.
nounswhich denote item composition such as aluminum, bra~ss, etc.).
A singulardeterminer (e.g.
a, an, each, etc.)
requires a siugular noun (I l l4) but a"universal" determiner (e.g.
some, the, etc.)
may bc used with singular orplural nouns (II15).
If there arc no premodifying nouns, then hyperrulcI l l6 will apply.
A single premodifying noun (II17) may bc either singularor a mass noun.
Note that  rnle I l l7  is nondeterminlstic in that there aretwo hyperalternativcs.
The condit.ion is satisfied if either onc of thesehypcrrules is satisfied.
If the premodifying uouns are co-ordinated with and(1118), then both nouns must be mass norms (e.g.
"the wooden and irondoor" is correct but  "the forest and garden path" is not).I a. condi tkm DETERM\[NI , ;R  POSSI,\]SSIVE_ NOUN .LIST tNO UN_SEQUENCE I~OSSI~SSIVE_NOUN_LIST2DENOMINAL_NOUN NOUNHEADlu correct in premodif ieat lon :condit ion DETERMINER correctly premodifie.~ NOUN I IEAD,condit ion NOUN SEQUFN(~E are s ingular  or mass II\[)II\[IS.14.

A simple object (H33) must satisfy thesame conditions as a subject and hyperrules H10-H12 will applyrecursively.

We claim that theother goals of consistency, precision (for our subset of English), andunambiguity are also achieved.
In the next section it will be shown howthis specification may be implemented automatically.5.
TWO-LEVEL  PARSIN( IOur method of natural language specification has two-levcls:metarules for eontexVfree syntax and hyperrules for context-sensitivesyntax.
Similarly our method of parsing a two-level grammar equires aparser for metarules and a parser for hyperrules.
Since the metarules arecontext-free, any of the well-known context-free paining algorithms (e.g.see \[17\]) may be used to derive a context-free structure of some inputsentence.
Context-free parsing will eliminate all sentences which do notsatisfy the context-free syntax of the language but is unable to eliminate530structures which are correct in the context-free sense but incorrect withrespect to context-sensitive syntax.
The hyperrule parser will further educethe set of sentences which arc considered to be grammatically valid byanalyzing the context-free parse tree for context-sensitive violations.The "parser" for the hyperrules i actually an interpreter developed bythe authors in \[4\] which evaluates the hyperrules in much the same way asa progrannning language interpreter executes programs.
The hyperrulesare interpreted sequentially in the order that conditions are enumerated inthe grammar.
Interpretation proceeds by expanding the stm't notion andapplying the hyperrules to all of the branches of the hypcrrule derivationtree until all of the prcdicatcs are evaluated.
As interpretation proceeds,each node of the derivation tree (corrcsponding to a hypernotion) isexpanded by matching it with a hyperrule lcft-hand sldc.
The right-handside of the matched hyperrule is then used to create a subtrcc for thatnode.
Each branch of tile tree is evaluated from left to right in a prc~ordcrtraversal.
The English sentence is syntactically correct if and only if theresulting terminal string derived by tbe hypcrrulc tree is the empty string.The method of writing hyperrules to derive only the einpty stringgreatly simplifies the parsing process.
Traditionally (e.g.
\[2, 10\]), ~wo-lcvelgrammars use tile hyperrules to generate the terminal s~rings of thelanguage with the metarules being used only to instantiatc hyperrules.
Forexample, in our grammar the metanotion SI?NTENCE is nscd to generateEnglish sentences which arc tben input to the hyperrules for anMysis.
Inother two-level grammar styles, however, the components of thc sentencewould also be generated by hypcrrules.
The result of hyperrules generatingterminal strings is that parsing bccmnes considerably more difficult and isnot accomplished without restrictions being placcd on hypcrrules (e.g.
\[15\]).Our method of interpreting hypcrrnles places no restricl, ions, thcrclorcallowing the tlg to be more gencral.
The differences in writing styles arecxplored further in I4\].The hyperrule interprctatkm algoritbm is outlined below:Procedure EvMuute (hypcrnotion)1.
Find tile hyperrule to apply wMch has tim hypernotion as its left.
:hand side.
This rule will bc of the form:hypernoffon : hypernotioa-I, hyperaotfon-2, ..., hypernoth>u-n.2.
Expand the derivation tree with hypernotion tts the root of thecurrent snbtree ~nd tile branches being hypernvtion-t, hypernolion..2,, hypernotfon-n.3.
Evaluate (hypernntion-i) for i ~= 1, 2~ .., n.To explain how this interpreter works, consider the examplc sentence"Professor White and the students who attend the university gave Mrs.White a present oday."
This sentence is seen to be correct, with respect ocontext-free syntax and its structural representation is shown in 1,'ignre 1.The specific metarules applied arc numbered.
We will now apply thehyperrules to this sentence to show how the context-sensitive conditionsarc verified.
For notational convenience we have italicized the protonotionswhich correspond to metanotions in the hyperrules.
Since the tree will bctraversed from left to right we will label the branches (i.e.
nodes) using anmnber (0-8) to denote the level in the tree and a letter (a-e) to indieaLelcf~ to right ordering.The root of the hyperrulc derivation tree is the sentence itself.\[Iyperrulc HI will be applied to initiate the verification process.
This willbe followed by H2 which divides the derivation tree into five separatebranches, one for each condition which the sentence must satisfy.0 ?
Professor White and the ~tudents who attend the university gave Mrs.White a present oday.1 ?
condition Professor White and the students who attend the universitygave Mrs. White a present oday, is a well-formed sentence2a * condition Professor White and the students who attend the universityghows subject-predicate agreement with gave2b * condition Professor White and the students who attend the nniversity isa well-formed subject2c ?
condition a present oday shows object-predicate agreement with gave2d * condition gave is a well-formed predicate2e ?
condition a present oday is a well-formed objectTo expand branch 2a and cheek the first condition, hyperrule H3 (noanxiliary verbs) is applied.
Since the subject is compound, rule H9 will beapplied, requiring the verb to be plural.
The "library" predicate will verifythe plurality of gave.2a ?
condition Professor White and the student8 who attend the universityshows subject-predicate greement with gave3a ?
condition Professor White and the students who attend the universityagrees in person and number with gave4a ?
where gave is plural5a ?tlyperrule H12 will be applied to expand branch 2b and decomposethe compound subject into its components.
IIyperrules l t l0 and I l l l  willthen analyze ach of the two respective sub-subjects for well-fm'medness.2b * condition Professor White and the students who attend the universityis a well-formed subject3b * condition Professor White is a well-formed subject4b *3c * condition the students who attend the university is a well-formedsubject4e * condition the students is correct in premodification4d .condition the students who attend the university is correct inpostmodifieationProceeding to construct he trce ill a left-to-right manner, branch 4c isexpanded next using hyperrule It13.
Since file determiner is universal and~here is no premodifying noun sequence, hypcrrules It15 and H16 completethis subtree.4c ?
condition the students is correct in premodifieation5b * condition the correctly premodifies students6a ?5c ?
condition EMPTY are singular or mass nouns6b *The expansion of branch 4d is one of the more interesting aspects ofthe context-sensitive analysis since it involves a relative clause.
Theanalysis is performed by hyperrules HI9, H21, ti22 and H27.
Note thatrule II27 rearranges ~hc relative clause into a new sentence and reem'sivelycalls hyperrule H2 to analyze the new sentence.4d o condition the students who attend the university is correct inpostmodification5d ?
condition who attend the nniversity correctly postmodifies the students6c .
condition students is a human noun7a * where ,students is a hll i l lD.n noun8& ?6d ?
condition the verb of who attend the nnivcrslty agrees with thestudents7b * condition the students attend the university, is a well-formed sentenceInstead of expanding branch 7b further, wc will resmne mlr exampleat branch 2c to verify the condition that the originM sentence must haveobject-predicate agreement.
Since the object sequence contains an indirectobject, direct object and an adverb, hyperrule H30 will be Nlplied next andsince the verb gave is ditransitive, object-predicate agreement will hesatisfied.2e * condition Mrs. White a present today shows object-predicateagreement with cave3d * where gave is ditransitive4e ?Returning to the top-level conditions, we next verify the well-formcdness of the verb gave.
Since there arc no auxiliary verbs, hypcrrulelt31 is satisfied.2d ?
condition gave is a well-formed predicate3e ?The final condition that the sentence must satisfy is well-formcdness of theobject.
Since the object is a sequence, rule H34 will be applied to branch 2cto decompose tile object sequence and analyze the indirect and directobjects individually by rule H33.
Rule Itaa calls rules II10-II12 recursively.Since Mrs. White is a named subject, hyperrule H10 is satisfied for tileindirect object.
By applying hypcrrules \[I11, II13, HI4, H16, It19 and 1120,the direct object a present will also be verified as a well-formed object.
Theanalysis is now complete and the sentence has been determined to becorrect through tile process of our twoqevel grammar interpretationmethod.6.
CONCLUSIONSWe have shown that two-level grammars may be used very elegantlyto give a formal specification of Ignglish context-fl'ec and context-sensitivesyntax.
In addition to the subset we have defined in this paper, manyother types of Nnglish declarative sentences have been formMly specifiedusing two-level grammars {7\].
There seems to be no obstacle to using rigspecifications for any type of natural anguage syntactic specification.Tile principal advantages of the two-level grammar mctManguage are:1) it is very readable and may be used to give a formal description using astructured form of natural anguage; 2) it is formal with many well-knownmathematical properties; and 3) it is directly implcmentable byinterpretation.
The significance of the latter fact is that once we havewritten a two-level grammm' for natural anguage syntax, we can derive aparser automatically without writing any additional specialized computerprograms.
The combination of readability and implementability is uniquein grammar theory for natural anguages.To give a complete spccification of natural language, semantics andknowledge representation must be specified in addition to syntax.
Ourfuture goals are the investigation of two-level grammar for semanticspecification.
Because of the ease with wtfich two-level grammars mayexpress logic \[6\] and their Turing computability \[12\], we expect that tlgswill also bc very suitable for these goals.REFERENCESIll Chomsky, N. Syntactic Structures.
