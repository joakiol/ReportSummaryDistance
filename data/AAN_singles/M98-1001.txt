Dr.San Diego, CA 92121chinchor@gso.saic.comOverviews of English and Multilingual TasksThe tasks performed by the systems participating in the seventh Message Understanding Conference and the SecondMultilingual Entity Task are described here in general terms with examples.EntitiesOn the level of entity extraction, Named Entities (NE) were defined as proper names and quantities of interest.Person, organization, and location names were marked as well as dates, times, percentages, and monetary amounts.The annotation was SGML within the text stream.
An example from MUC-7 (New York Times News Service) inEnglish follows.The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> satellite television broadcaster said its subscriber basegrew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.5 percent</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pastyear</TIMEX> to 5.35 millionThe Named Entity task was carried out in Chinese and Japanese (MET-2) concurrently with English (MUC-7).Equivalence ClassesThe task of Coreference (CO) had its origins in Semeval, an attempt after MUC-5 to define semantic research tasksthat needed to be solved to be successful at generating scenario templates.
In the MUC evaluations, only coreferenceof type identity was marked and scored [3].
The following example from MUC-7 (New York Times News Service)illustrates identity coreference between "its" and "The U.K. satellite television broadcaster" as well as that betweenthe function "its subscriber base" and the value "5.35 million.
"*The U.K. satellite television broadcaster* said **its* subscriber base* grew 17.5 percent during the past year to*5.35 million*The coreference task is a bridge between the NE task and the TE task.AttributesThe attributes of entities are slot fills in Template Elements (TE) that consist of name, type, descriptor, and categoryslots.
The attributes in the Template Element serve to further identify the entity beyond the name level.All aliases are put in the NAME slot.
Persons, organizations, artifacts, and locations are all TYPEs of TemplateElements.
All substantial descriptors used in the text appear in the DESCRIPTOR slot.
The CATEGORY slotcontains categories dependent on the element involved: persons can be civilian, military, or other; organizations canbe government, company, or other; artifacts are limited to vehicles and can be for traveling on land, water, or in air;locations can be city, province, country, region, body of water, airport, or unknown.
An example of a TemplateElement from MUC-7 follows:<ENTITY-9602040136-11> :=ENT_NAME: "Dennis Gillespie"ENT_TYPE: PERSONENT_DESCRIPTOR: "Capt.
"/ "the commander of Carrier Air Wing 11"ENT_CATEGORY: PER_MILFactsThe Template Relations (TR) task marks relationships between template elements and can be thought of as a task inwhich well-defined facts are extracted from newswire text.In MUC-7, we limited TR to relationships with organizations: employee_of, product_of, location_of.
However, thetask is easily expandable to all logical combinations and relations between entity typesAn example of TemplateRelations from MUC-7 follows:<EMPLOYEE_OF-9602040136-5> :=PERSON: <ENTITY-9602040136-11>ORGANIZATION: <ENTITY-9602040136-1><ENTITY-9602040136-11> :=ENT_NAME: "Dennis Gillespie"ENT_TYPE: PERSONENT_DESCRIPTOR: "Capt.
"/ "the commander of Carrier Air Wing 11"ENT_CATEGORY: PER_MIL<ENTITY-9602040136-1> :=ENT_NAME: "NAVY"ENT_TYPE: ORGANIZATIONENT_CATEGORY: ORG_GOVTEventsThe Scenario Template (ST) was built around an event in which entities participated.
The scenario provided thedomain of the dataset and allowed for relevancy judgments of high accuracy by systems.The task definition for ST required relevancy and fill rules.
The choice of the domain was dependent to some extenton the evaluation epoch.
The structure of the template and the task definition tended to be dependent on the author ofthe task, but the richness of the templates also served to illustrated the utility of information extraction to users mosteffectively.The filling of the slots in the scenario template was generally a difficult task for systems and a relatively large effortwas required to produce ground truth.
Reasonable agreement(>80%) between annotators was possible, but requiredsometimes ornate refinement of the task definition based on the data encountered.How MUC-7 Differed from Previous MUCsFor the first time, the multilingual NE evaluation was run using training and test articles from comparable domainsfor all languages.
The domain for all languages for training was airline crashes and the domain for all languages fortesting was launch events.
The domain change between the dry run and the formal run caused similar effects acrosslanguages.
Sites expressed disappointment in their formal test scores when compared with their development testscores, but the formal test scores were still above the 80% operational threshold set by customers without any changesbeing made to systems for the domain change.In MUC-7, there were more international sites participating than ever before.
The papers reflect interestingobservations by system developers who were non-native speakers of the language of their system and systemdevelopers who were native speakers of the language of their system.In MUC-7, more data was provided for training and dry run and it was maintained through all of the updates to theguidelines during the evaluation cycle.
The markup will be publicly available on the MUC website athttp:\\www.muc.saic.com in the form of offsets from the beginning of each document.
The rights to the documentsthemselves can be purchased from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).The task definitions for MUC-7 were improved by having authors other than the original authors revise each of theguidelines for internal consistency and to dovetail into the other tasks evaluated.
The communal effort in polishingthe guidelines and the data markup noticeably improved the evaluation..Table 1: Tasks Evaluated in MUC-3 through MUC-7Table 2: Maximum Results Reported in MUC-3 through MUC-7 by TaskEvaluation/TasksNamedEntity CoreferenceTemplateElementTemplateRelationScenarioTemplate MultilingualMUC-3 ?

So it is fitting to give a briefhistory of the Evaluations that were publicly funded.
The major parameters of growth over the years were the tasksand the results.
The tables below review these changes beginning with MUC-3.
The two earlier evaluations wereinitiated, designed, and carried out by Beth Sundheim under the auspices of the Navy and focused on extraction frommilitary messages.
Those evaluations listed here have been carried out under the auspices of the Tipster Text Programand focused on extraction from newswire articles.
Scoring automation and other tools were supported under thisprogram as well as research in evaluation methodology.Guide to the MUC-7 ProceedingsThe Table of Contents shows participants by task and language.
Each site submitted paper(s) covering their task(s).For a separate list of which sites performed each of the tasks described above, please refer to Elaine Marsh's slides inthis volume.The appendices to the proceedings contain test materials and other supporting materials that augment the papers in theproceedings.
For each of the tasks, a walkthrough article was chosen to allow all of the sites participating in that taskto discuss their system response for a common article.
The walkthrough articles and the answer keys for each taskappear first.Following the walkthroughs are the formal task definitions provided to all of the sites participating.
The datasetsdiscussed were all marked up by human annotators following these guidelines.
Next are the score reports output bythe automatic scorer which compared the system responses on each task to the human generated answer keys for theformal run test articles.
The statistical results represent the significance groupings of the sites for each task based onan approximate randomization algorithm run on the document-by-document scores for each pair of sites.
For NamedEntity in English, the human annotators' scores are given and included in the statistical significance testing becauseMUC-3 ?

The annotators were significantly better than thesystems.
Finally, there is the User's Manual for the automated scorer which is in the public domain.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to acknowledge DARPA as our major funding agency throughout our work on the evaluations.
