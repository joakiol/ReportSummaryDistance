FranceGilles.Serasset@imag.frAbstractThe motivation of the Papillon project is toencourage the development of freely accessibleMultilingual Lexical Resources by way of on-line collaborative work on the Internet.
For this,we developed a generic community website orig-inally dedicated to the diffusion and the devel-opment of a particular acception based multilin-gual lexical database.The generic aspect of our platform allowsits use for the development of other lexicaldatabases.
Adapting it to a new lexical databaseis a matter of description of its structures andinterfaces by way of XML files.
In this paper, weshow how we already adapted it to other verydifferent lexical databases.
We also show whatfuture developments should be done in order togather several lexical databases developers in acommon network.1 IntroductionIn order to cope with information available inmany languages, modern information systemsneed large, high quality and multilingual lexi-cal resources.
Building such a resource is veryexpensive.
To reduce these costs, we chose touse the ?collaborative?
development paradigmalready used with LINUX and other open sourcedevelopments.In order to develop such a specific multilin-gual lexical database, we built a Web platformto gather an Internet community around lex-ical services (accessing many online dictionar-ies, contributing to a rich lexical database, vali-dating contributions from others, sharing doc-uments, .
.
.
).
Initially built for the Papillonproject, this platform is generic and allows forthe collaborative development of other lexicalresources (monolingual, bilingual or multilin-gual) provided that such resources are describedto the platform.After presenting the Papillon project andplatform, we will show how we may give accessto many existing dictionaries, using an unifiedinterface.
Then, we will present the edition ser-vice, and detail how it may be customised tohandle other very different dictionaries.2 The Papillon project2.1 MotivationsInitially launched in 2000 by a French-Japaneseconsortium, the Papillon project1 (S?rasset andMangeot-Lerebours, 2001) rapidly extended itsoriginal goal ?
the development of a rich FrenchJapanese lexical database ?
to its actual goal ?the development of an Acception based Multilin-gual Lexical Database (currently tackling Chi-nese, English , French, German, Japanese, Lao,Malay, Thai and Vietnamese).This evolution was motivated in order to:?
reuse many existing lexical resources eventhe ones that do not directly involve bothinitial languages,?
be reusable by many people on the Internet,hence raising the interest of others in itsdevelopment,?
allow for external people (translator, nativespeakers, teachers.
.
. )
to contribute to itsdevelopment,For this project, we chose to adopt as muchas possible the development paradigm of LINUXand GNU software2, as we believe that the lackof high level, rich and freely accessible multi-lingual lexical data is one of the most crucialobstacle for the development of a truly multilin-gual information society3.1http://www.papillon-dictionary.org/2i.e.
allowing and encouraging external users to ac-cess and contribute to the database.3i.e.
an Information Society with no linguistic dom-ination and where everybody will be able to access anycontent in its own mother tongue.2.2 Papillon acception basedmultilingual databaseThe Papillon multilingual database has been de-signed independently of its usage(s).
It consistsin several monolingual volumes linked by way ofa single interlingual volume called the interlin-gual acception dictionary.Fran?aisAnglaisMalaisJaponaisAxiesRiz (plante monocotyl?done)Riz (grain)Rice (food grain)Rice (seeds)???
?padi (unharvestedgrain)nasi (cooked)beras (uncooked)Figure 1: Macrostructure of the PapillonMLDB, showing the handling of contractiveproblems.Each monolingual volume consists in a set ofword senses (lexies), each lexie being describedusing a structure derived from the Explanatoryand Combinatory Dictionary (Mel?
?uk et al,1995; Mel?
?uk et al, 1984 1989 1995 1996).The interlingual acception dictionary consistsin a set of interlingual acceptions (axies) as de-fined in (S?rasset, 1994).
An interlingual accep-tion serves as a placeholder bearing links to lex-ies and links between axies4.
This simple mech-anism allows for the coding of translations.
Asan example, figure 1 shows how we can repre-sent a quadrilingual database with contrastiveproblems (on the well known ?rice?
example).2.3 Development methodologyThe development of the Papillon multilingualdictionary gathers voluntary contributors andtrusted language specialist involved in differenttasks (as shown in figure 2).?
First, an automatic process creates adraft acception based multilingual lexicaldatabase from existing monolingual andbilingual lexical resources as shown in(Teeraparseree, 2003; Mangeot-Lerebourset al, 2003).
This step is called the boot-strapping process.4Note that these links are not interpreted semanti-cally, but only reflect the fact that translation is possiblePapillon serverL1<->L3L2<->L3L1L2L3reused databootstrappingPapillon databaseL1 L2L3AxiesDocumentDocumentDocumentModifications/additions/SuppressionsIntegrationContributionsValidationsFigure 2: Methodology for the development ofthe Papillon database.?
Then, contributions may be performed byvolunteers or trusted language specialists.A contribution is either the modificationof an entry, its creation or its deletion.Each contribution is stored and immedi-ately available to others.?
Volunteers or language specialist may vali-date these contributions by ranking them.?
Finally, trusted language specalists will in-tegrate the contribution and apply them tothe master MLDB.
Rejected contributionswon?t be available anymore.2.4 The Papillon PlatformThe Papillon platform is a community web sitespecifically developed for this project.
This plat-form is entirely written in Java using the ?En-hydra5?
web development Framework.
All XMLdata is stored in a standard relational database(Postgres).
This community web site proposesseveral services:?
a unified interface to simultaneously ac-cess the Papillon MLDB and several othermonolingual and bilingual dictionaries;?
a specific edition interface to contribute tothe Papillon MLDB,?
an open document repository where regis-tered users may share writings related tothe project; among these documents, onemay find all the papers presented in the5see http://www.enhydra.org/different Papillon workshops organized eachyear by the project partners;?
a mailing list archive,Sections 3 and 4 present the first and secondservices.3 Unified access to existingdictionaries3.1 PresentationFigure 3: The unified access interface and re-sults from three different dictionariesTo encourage volunteers, we think that it isimportant to give a real service to attract asmany Internet users as possible.
As a result, webegan our development with a service to allowusers to access to many dictionaries in a uni-fied way.
This service currently gives access totwelve (12) bilingual and monolingual dictionar-ies, totalizing a little less than 1 million entries,as detailled in table 1.3.2 Strong pointsThe unified access interface allows the userto access simultaneously to several dictionarieswith different structures.
All available dictio-nary will be queried according to its own struc-ture.
Moreover, all results will be displayed in aform that fits its own structure.Any monolingual, bilingual or multilingualdictionary may be added in this collection, pro-vided that it is available in XML format.With the Papillon platform, giving access toa new, unknown, dictionary is a matter of writ-ing 2 XML files: a dictionary description and anDictionary Languages Nb of EntriesArmamenta fra eng 1116Cedictb zho eng 215424Dingc deu eng 124413Engdictd eng kor 214127FeMe fra eng msa 19247Homericaf fra 441JMDictg jp en fr de 96264KanjiDicth jpn eng 6355Papillon multi 1323ThaiDicti tha 10295VietDictj fra vie 41029WaDokuJiTenk jpn deu 214274aJapanese French dictionary of armament from theFrench Embassy in JapanbChinese English from Mandel Shi (Xiamen univ.

For currently available dictio-naries, this took an average of about one hourper dictionary.3.3 ImplementationIt is possible to give access to any XML dictio-nary, regardless of its structure.
For this, youhave to identify a minimum set of informationin the dictionary?s XML structure.The Papillon platform defines a standardstructure of an abstract dictionary contain-ing the most frequent subset of informationfound in most dictionaries.
This abstract struc-ture is called the Common Dictionary Markup(Mangeot-Lerebours and S?rasset, 2002).
Todescribe a new dictionary, one has to write anXML file that associate CDM element to point-ers in the original dictionary structure.As an example, the French English MalayFeM dictionary (Gut et al, 1996) has a specificstructure, illustrated by figure 4.Figure 5 gives the XML code associating el-ements of the FeM dictionary with elements ofthe CDM.Along with this description, one has to de-<HFEM xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/.../namespace"><HW-FRE>montre</HW-FRE><HOM/><PRNC>mon-tr(e)</PRNC><AUX/><BODY><SENSE-STAR><SENSE><CAT-STAR>n.f.</CAT-STAR><SENSE1-STAR><SENSE1><TRANS-STAR><TRANS><ENG-STAR>watch</ENG-STAR><MAL-STAR>jam</MAL-STAR></TRANS></TRANS-STAR><EXPL-STAR/></SENSE1></SENSE1-STAR></SENSE></SENSE-STAR></BODY></HFEM>Figure 4: A simplified example entry from theFrench English Malay FeM dictionary.<cdm-elements><cdm-volume element="volume"/><cdm-entry element="HFEM"/><cdm-headword element="HW-FRE"/><cdm-pronunciation element="PRNC"/><cdm-pos element="CAT-STAR"/><cdm-definition element="FRE"/><cdm-translation d:lang="eng"element="ENG-STAR"/><cdm-translation d:lang="msa"element="MAL-STAR"/><cdm-example d:lang="fra" element="FRE"/><cdm-example d:lang="eng" element="ENG"/><cdm-example d:lang="msa" element="MAL"/><cdm-key1 element="HOM"/></cdm-elements>Figure 5: Associations between elements of theFeM dictionary and elements of the CDM.fine an XSL style sheet that will be applied onrequested dictionary elements to produce theHTML code that defines the final form of theresult.
If such a style sheet is not provided,the Papillon platform will itself transform thedictionary structure into a CDM structure (us-ing the aforementioned description) and apply ageneric style sheet on this structure.4 Editing dictionaries entries4.1 PresentationAs the main purpose of the Papillon platform isto gather a community around the developmentof a dictionary, we also developed a service forthe edition of dictionary entries.Figure 6: The edition interface is a standardHTML interfaceAny user, who is registered and logged in tothe Papillon web site, may contribute to the Pa-pillon dictionary6 by creating or editing7 an en-try.
Moreover, when a user asks for an unknownword, he is encouraged to contribute it to thedictionary.Contribution is made through a standardHTML interface (see figure 6).
This interfaceis rather crude and raises several problems.
Forinstance, there is no way to copy/paste part ofan existing entry into the edition window.
More-over, editing has to be done on-line8.
However,as the interface uses only standard HTML ele-ments with minimal javascript functionality, itmay be used with any Internet browser on anyplatform (provided that the browser/platformcorrectly handles unicode forms).4.2 Strong pointsFrom the beginning, we wanted this interfaceto be fully customizable by Papillon members6And, for now, only to this particular dictionary.7Removal of an entry is not yet implemented.8In fact, entries may be edited off-line and uploadedon the server, but there is currently no specialized inter-face for off-line edition, meaning that users will have touse standard text/XML editor for this.without relying on the availability of a computerscience specialist.
our reasons are:?
the fact that we wanted the structure of thePapillon dictionary to be adaptable alongwith the evolution of the project, withoutimplying a full revisit of the web site imple-mentation;?
the fact that each language may slightlyadapt the Papillon structure to fit its ownneeds (specific set of part of speech, lan-guage levels, etc.
), hence adding a new dic-tionary implies adding a new custom inter-face;Hence, we chose to develop a system capableof generating a usable interface from a) a de-scription of the dictionary structure (an XMLSchema) and b) a description of the mappingbetween element of the XML structure and stan-dard HTML inputs.For this, we used the ARTStudio tool de-scribed by (Calvary et al, 2001).
Using a toolthat allows for the development of plastic userinterfaces allows us to generate not only one, butseveral interfaces on different devices.
Hence,as we are now able to generate an HTML in-terface usable with any standard web browsersupporting Unicode, we may, in the future, gen-erate interfaces for Java applications (that canbe used offline) or interfaces for portable deviceslike pocket PCs or Palm computers.4.3 Implementation4.3.1 Definition of the dictionarystructureTo provide an edition interface, the Papillonplatform needs to know the exact dictionarystructure.
The structure has to be defined asa standard XML schema.
We chose to use XMLschema because it allows for a finer descriptioncompared to DTDs (for instance, we may de-fine the set of valid values of the textual contentof an XML element).
Moreover XML schemataprovides a simple inheritance mechanism thatis useful for the definition of a dictionary.
Forinstance, we defined a general structure for thePapillon dictionary (figure 7) and used the in-heritance mechanism to refine this general struc-ture for each language (as in figure 8).4.3.2 Description of the interfaceDescribing the interface is currently the mostdelicate required operation.
The first step is todefine the set of elements that will appear in the<element name="lexie"><complexType><sequence><element ref="d:headword" minOccurs="1"macOccurs="1" /><element ref="d:writing" ... /><element ref="d:reading" ... /><element ref="d:pronunciation" ... /><element ref="d:pos" ... /><element ref="d:language-levels" ... /><element ref="d:semantic-formula" ... /><element ref="d:government-pattern" .../><element ref="d:lexical-functions" ... /><element ref="d:examples" ... /><element ref="d:full-idioms" ... /><element ref="d:more-info" ... /></sequence><attribute ref="d:id" use="required" /></complexType></element>...<element name="pos" type="d:posType" /><simpleType name="posType"><restriction base="string" /></simpleType>...Figure 7: General structure shared by all vol-umes of the Papillon dictionary; showing thepart of speech element pos defined as a textualelement.<simpleType name="posType"><restriction base="d:posType"><enumeration value="n.m." /><enumeration value="n.m.

/><enumeration value="n.f.
pl."
/>...</restriction></simpleType>Figure 8: Redefinition of the type of the partof speech pos element in the Papillon Frenchdefinition.interface and their relation with the dictionarystructure.
Each such element is given a uniqueID.
This step defines an abstract interface whereall elements are known, but not their layout, northeir kind.This step allows for the definition of severaldifferent tasks for the edition of a single dictio-nary.The second step is to define the concrete re-alization and the position of all these elements.For instance, in this step, we specify the POSelement to be rendered as a menu.
Several kindof widgets are defined by ARTStudio.
Amongthem, we find simple HTML inputs like textboxes, menus, check-boxs, radio buttons, la-bels.
.
.
, but we also find several high level el-ements like generic lists of complex elements.As an simple example, we will see how the pos(part of speech) element is rendered in the Pa-pillon interface.
First, there will be an interfaceelement (called S.364) related to the pos element(figure 9).
Second, this element will be realizedin our interface as a comboBox (figure 10).<Instance type="element" id="S.364"><InstanceKind value="static"/><InstanceBuildKind value="regular"/><Name value="pos"/><ClassNameSpace value=""/><ClassName value="posType"/><TaskOwnerID value="S.360"/><TaskRangeID list="S.360"/></Instance>Figure 9: Definition of the abstract interface el-ement associated to the pos element.
This el-ement will display/edit value of type posTypedefined in the aforementioned schema.<Interactor type="element"class="GraphicInteractor" id="i2008"><Type value="presentation"/><TaskID value="S.363"/><InteractorID value="ComboBox"/><InstanceID value="S.364"/><Width value="10"/><Height value="20"/></Interactor>Figure 10: Definition of the effective widget forthe pos element.Using this technique is rather tricky as thereis currently no simple interface to generate theserather complex descriptions.
However, usingthese separate description allows the definitionof several edition tasks (depending on the userprofile) and also allows, for a single task, to gen-erate several concrete interfaces, depending onthe device that will be used for edition (size ofthe screen, methods of interactions, etc.
).4.3.3 Interface generationUsing the describe structure of the dictionary,we are able to generate an empty dictionary en-try containing all mandatory elements.
Then,we walk this structure and instantiate all as-sociated widgets (in our case HTML input ele-ments), as defined in the interface description.This way, we are able to generate the corre-sponding HTML form.When the user validates a modification, val-ues of the HTML input elements are associatedto the corresponding parts of the edited dictio-nary structure (this is also the case if the userasks for the addition/suppression of an elementin the structure).
Then, we are able to regener-ate the interface for the modified structure.
Weiterate this step until the user saves the modifiedstructure.5 ConclusionsThe Papillon platform is still under develop-ment.
However, it already proves useful for thediffusion of a little less than 1 million entriesfrom 12 very different dictionaries.
This is pos-sible as, from the very beginning, we designedthe platform to be as a generic as possible.This genericity also allows for its use for theon-line development of the Papillon database.It is also used for the development of the Esto-nian French GDEF dictionary, managed by An-toine Chalvin from INALCO, Paris.
Moreover,we developed an interface for the japanese Ger-man WadokujiTen (Apel, 2004).
This provesthat our platform may be useful in a generalcontext.Our future activities will follow 3 axis:?
improving the definition of edition inter-faces; currently, we have no tool to simplifythis definition and its complexity makes itdifficult for a linguist to use it without helpfrom computer science specialists;?
generating different interfaces from thesame descriptions; currently, we only gener-ate on-line HTML interfaces, but the toolswe use allows for the development of inter-faces in other contexts; hence with the sameapproach, we will develop java applets orjava applications to be used either on-lineor off-line;?
developing network cooperation modulesbetween several instances of the Papillonplatform; this will allow the deployment ofthe platform on several sites; we will ad-dress two aspects of such a deployment;first, duplication of identical instances pro-viding access and edition services on thesame dictionaries; second the deploymentof several instances providing access andedition services on different dictionaries(where dictionaries edited on a site may beaccessed on another site).6 AcknowledgementsDevelopments on the Papillon project could nothave taken place without support from CNRS(France) and JSPS (Japan).
We would like towarmly thank Fran?ois Brown de Colstoun whosupports this project since its very beginning.Developments of the platform and especially theediting part has been mainly done by MathieuMangeot and David Thevenin during their PostDoctoral fellowship at NII (National Institue ofInformatics), Tokyo.
Finally the Papillon plat-form would not be useful without partners whoagreed to give free access to their superb dictio-naries.ReferencesUlrich Apel.
