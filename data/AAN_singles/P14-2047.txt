that significantly impact the qual-ity of machine translation.
Our analysisis based on manual evaluations of trans-lations of news from Chinese and Ara-bic to English.
We find that there is aparticularly strong mismatch in the no-tion of what constitutes a sentence in Chi-nese and English, which occurs often andis associated with significant degradationin translation quality.
Also related tolower translation quality is the need to em-ploy multiple explicit discourse connec-tives (because, but, etc.
), as well as thepresence of ambiguous discourse connec-tives in the English translation.
Further-more, the mismatches between discourseexpressions across languages significantlyimpact translation quality.1 IntroductionIn this study we examine how the use of dis-course devices to organize information in a sen-tence ?
and the mismatch in their usage acrosslanguages ?
influence machine translation (MT)quality.
The goal is to identify discourse process-ing tasks with high potential for improving trans-lation systems.Historically MT researchers have focused theirattention on the mismatch of linear realization ofsyntactic arguments (Galley et al, 2004; Collinset al, 2005), lexico-morphological mismatch(Minkov et al, 2007; Habash and Sadat, 2006)and word polysemy (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chanet al, 2007).
Discourse structure has largely beenconsidered irrelevant to MT, mostly due to the as-sumption that discourse analysis is needed to inter-pret multi-sentential text while statistical MT sys-tems are trained to translate a single sentence inone language into a single sentence in another.However, discourse devices are at play in the or-ganization of information into complex sentences.The mere definition of sentence may differ acrosslanguages.
Chinese for example is anecdotallyknown to allow for very long sentences which attimes require the use of multiple English sentencesto express the same content and preserve gram-maticality.
Similarly discourse connectives likebecause, but, since and while often relate informa-tion expressed in simple sentential clauses.
Thereare a number of possible complications in trans-lating these connectives: they may be ambiguousbetween possible senses, e.g., English while is am-biguous between COMPARISON and TEMPORAL;explicit discourse connectives may be translatedinto implicit discourse relations or translated inmorphology rather than lexical items (Meyer andWebber, 2013; Meyer and Pol?akov?a, 2013).In our work, we quantify the relationship be-tween information packaging, discourse devices,and translation quality.2 Data and experiment settingsWe examine the quality of translations to Englishfrom Chinese and Arabic using Human-targetedTranslation Edit Rates (HTER) (Snover et al,2006), which roughly captures the minimal num-ber of edits necessary to transform the systemoutput into an acceptable English translation ofthe source sentence.
By comparing MT outputwith post-edited references, HTER provides morereliable estimates of translation quality than us-ing translated references, especially at the seg-ment level.
The data for the analysis is drawnfrom an extended set of newswire reports in the2008/2010 NIST Metrics for Machine Translation283GALE Evaluation set1.
For Chinese, there are305 sentences (segments) translated to English bythree different translation systems.
For Arabic,there are 363 Arabic sentences (segments) trans-lated by two systems.The presence of discourse devices is analyzedonly on the English side: the reference, the systemhypothesis and its edited translation.
Discourseconnectives and their senses are identified usingexisting tools developed for English.
Beyond itspractical limitations, analyzing the reference inter-estingly reflects the choices made by the humantranslator: whether to choose to use a discourseconnective, or to insert one to make an implicit re-lation on the source side explicit on the target side.We first conduct analysis of variance (ANOVA)with HTER as dependent variable and the dis-course factors as independent variables, and sys-tems as subjects.
We examine within-subject sig-nificance in each ANOVA model.
For discoursefactors that are significant at the 95% confidencelevel or higher according to the ANOVA analy-sis, we provide detailed breakdown of the systemHTER for each value of the discourse factor.In this paper we do not compare the perfor-mance of individual systems, but instead seek tounderstand if a discourse phenomena is problem-atic across systems.23 Sentence length and HTERThe presence of complex discourse structure islikely to be associated with longer sentences.
Itstands to reason that long sentences will be harderto process automatically and this reasoning hasmotivated the first approaches to text simplifica-tion (Chandrasekar et al, 1996).
So before turningto the analysis of discourse phenomena, we exam-ine the correlation between translation quality andsentence length.
A strong correlation between thetwo would call for revival of interest in text sim-plification where syntactically complex sentencesare transformed into several shorter sentences as apreprocessing step.We find however that no strong relationship ex-ists between the two, as shown by the correlationcoefficients between HTER values and the numberof words in each segment in Table 1.1Data used in this work includes more documents and thehuman edits not present in the official release.2For the readers with keen interest in system comparison,we note that according to ANOVA none of the differences insystem performance on this data is statistically significant.Lan.

Chi-nese is known for sentences of this kind; for exam-ple, the usage of punctuation is very different inChinese in the sense that a comma can sometimesfunction as a full stop in English, motivating a se-ries of disambiguation tasks (Jin et al, 2004; Xueand Yang, 2011; Xu and Li, 2013).
Special han-dling of long Chinese sentences were also shownto improve machine translation (Jin and Liu, 2010;Yin et al, 2007).To investigate the prevalence of sentences in thesource language (Chinese and Arabic in our case)that do not confirm to the notion of sentence in thetarget language (English for the purposes of thisstudy), we separate the translation segments in thesource language into two classes: a source sen-tence is considered 1-1 if the reference translationconsists of exactly one sentence, and 1-many if thereference contains more than one sentence.For Chinese, 26.2% of the source segments are1-many.
These sentences tend to be much longerthan average (36.6% of all words in all referencetranslations are part of such segments).
For Ara-bic, the numbers are 15.2% and 26.3%, respec-tively.
Below is an example of a 1-many Chinesesegment, along with the human reference and itstranslation by one of the systems:[source] ??????Erinys????????RISC??????????????????????????????

An(*) denotes significance at p < 0.05.1-many) as the independent variable and systemstreated as subjects.
The test revealed that there isa significant difference in translation quality be-tween 1-1 and 1-many segments for Chinese butnot for Arabic.
For the Chinese to English systemswe further ran a Wilcoxon rank sum test to iden-tify the statistical significance in performance forindividual systems.
For two of the three systemsthe difference is significant, as shown in Table 2.We have now established that 1-many segmentsin Chinese to English translation are highly preva-lent and their translations are of consistently lowerquality compared to 1-1 segments.
This findingsuggests a cross language discourse analysis taskof identifying Chinese sentences that cannot betranslated into single English sentences.
This taskmay be related to existing efforts in comma dis-ambiguation in Chinese (Jin et al, 2004; Xue andYang, 2011; Xu and Li, 2013) but the relation-ship between the two problems needs to be clar-ified in follow up work.
Once 1-many segmentsare identified, source-side text simplification tech-niques may be developed (Siddharthan, 2006) toimprove translation quality.5 Explicit discourse relationsExplicit discourse relations such as COMPARISON,CONTINGENCY or TEMPORAL are signaled byan explicit connective, i.e., however or because.The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad etal., 2008) provides annotations for the argumentsand relation senses of one hundred pre-selecteddiscourse connectives over the news portion ofthe Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al, 1993).Based on the PDTB, accurate systems for explicitdiscourse relation identification have been devel-oped (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009; Lin et al, 2014).The accuracy of these systems is 94% or higher,close to human performance on the task.

We com-pare the translation quality obtained on segmentswith reference translation containing no discourseconnective, exactly one discourse connective andmore than one discourse connective.The ANOVA indicates that the number of con-nectives is not a significant factor for Arabic trans-lation, but significantly impacts Chinese transla-tion quality.
A closer inspection using Wilcoxonrank sum tests reveals that the difference in trans-lation quality is statistically significant only be-tween the groups of segments with no connectivevs.
those with more than one connective.
Addi-tionally, we ran Wilcoxon rank sum test over 1-1 and 1-many segments individually and find thatthe presence of discourse connectives is associatedwith worse quality only in the latter case.
Effectsabove are illustrated in Table 3.5.2 Ambiguity of connectivesA number of discourse connectives are ambiguouswith respect to the discourse relation they convey.For example, while can signal either COMPARI-3http://www.cis.upenn.edu/?epitler/discourse.html; Weused the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).285AOV Arabic ChinesePr(> F ) 0.57 0.00014*has-amb-conn no-amb-connSystem HTER mean HTER meanZH-Sys1 21.57 16.34*ZH-Sys2 21.44 19.72ZH-Sys3 27.47 20.69*Table 4: ANOVA for both languages; averageHTER for the three Chinese systems for segmentswith (11.80% of all data) and without an ambigu-ous connective in the reference translation.

In transla-tion this becomes a problem when the ambiguityis present in one language but not in the other.In such cases the sense in source ought to be dis-ambiguated before translation.
Here we comparethe translation quality of segments which containambiguous discourse connectives in the referencetranslation to those that do not.
This analysis giveslower bound on the translation quality degradationassociated with discourse phenomena as it doesnot capture problems arising from connective am-biguity on the source side.We base our classification of discourse connec-tives into ambiguous or not according to the dis-tribution of their senses in the PDTB.
We call aconnective ambiguous if its most frequent senseamong COMPARISON, CONTINGENCY, EXPAN-SION, TEMPORAL accounts for less than 80% ofoccurrence of that connective in the PDTB.
Nine-teen connectives meet this criterion of ambiguity.4In the ANOVA tests for each language, we com-pared the quality of segments which contained anambiguous connective in the reference with thosethat do not, with systems treated as subjects.
ForArabic the presence of ambiguous connective didnot yield a statistically significant difference.
Thedifference however was highly significant for Chi-nese, as shown in Table 4.The finding that discourse connective ambigu-ity is associated with change in translation qualityfor Chinese but not for Arabic is rather interesting.It appears that the language pair in translation im-pacts the expected gains from discourse analysison translation.4The ambiguous connectives are: as, as if, as long as, asthough, finally, if and when, in the end, in turn, lest, mean-while, much as, neither...nor, now that, rather, since, ulti-mately, when, when and if, whileAOV Event Arabic ChinesePr(> F ) Contingency 0.61 0.028*Comp.:Temp.

In the ANOVA analysis we used abinary factor for each of the four possible senses.For example, we compare the translation qualityof segments that contain COMPARISON relationsin the reference translation with those that do not.The relation sense makes a significant differ-ence in translation quality for Chinese but not forArabic.
For Chinese specifically sentences that ex-press CONTINGENCY relations have worse qual-ity translations than sentences that do not expressCONTINGENCY.
One explanation for this ten-dency may be that CONTINGENCY in Chinese con-tains more ambiguity with other relations such asTEMPORAL, as tense is expressed lexically in Chi-nese (no morphological tense marking on verbs).Finally, the interaction between COMPARISON andTEMPORAL is significant for both languages.Table 5 shows the effect of relation sense onHTER values for Chinese.6 Human edits of discourse connectivesA relation expressed implicitly without a connec-tive in one language may need to be explicit inanother.
Moreover, the expressions themselvesare used differently; for example, the paired con-nective ???...???
(despite...but) in Chineseshould not be translated into two redundant con-nectives in English.
It is also possible that thesource language contains an explicit discourse286connective which is not translated in the target lan-guage, as has been quantitatively studied recentlyby Meyer and Webber (2013).
An example fromour dataset is shown below:[source] ??????????????????????????????????
[ref] Still some others can receive further professional gametraining in universities and later(Temporal) be employed astechnical consultants by large game manufacturers, etc.
[sys] Some people may go to the university games profes-sional education, which is appointed as the big game manu-facturers such as technical advisers.
[edited] Some people may go to university to receive profes-sional game education, and later(Temporal) be appointed bythe big game manufacturers as technical advisers.The system fails to translate the discourse con-nective ????
(later), leading to a probable mis-interpretation between receiving education and be-ing appointed as technical advisors.Due to the lack of reliable tools and resources,we approximate mismatches between discourseexpressions in the source and MT output usingdiscourse-related edits.
We identify explicit dis-course connectives and their senses in the systemtranslation and the human edited version of thattranslation.
Then we consider the following mu-tually exclusive possibilities: (i) there are no dis-course connectives in either the system output orthe edit; (ii) the system output and its edited ver-sion contain exactly the same discourse connec-tives with the same senses; (iii) there is a discourseconnective present in the system output but not inthe edit or vice versa.
In the ANOVA we use afactor with three levels corresponding to the threecases described above.
The factor is significant forboth Chinese and Arabic.
In both languages, themismatch case (iii) involves significantly higherHTER than either case (i) or (ii).
The human editrate in the mismatch class is on average four pointsgreater than that in the other classes.Obviously, the mismatch in implicit/explicit ex-pression of discourse relation is related to thefirst problem we studied, i.e., if the source seg-ment is translated into one or multiple sentencesin English, since discourse relations between adja-cent sentences are more often implicit (than intra-sentence ones).
For this reason we performed aWilcoxon rank sum test for the translation qual-ity of segments with discourse mismatch condi-tioned on whether the segment was 1-1 or 1-many.For both languages a significant difference wasfound for 1-1 sentences but not 1-many.

Translation quality degrades signifi-cantly for all systems for the mismatch case, overall data as well as 1-1 segments.7 ConclusionWe showed that translation from Chinese to En-glish is made more difficult by various discourseevents such as the use of discourse connectives,the ambiguity of the connectives and the type ofrelations they signal.
None of these discourse fac-tors has a significant impact on translation qual-ity from Arabic to English.
Translation qualityfrom both languages is adversely affected by trans-lations of discourse relations expressed implicitlyin one language but explicitly in the other or bypaired connectives.
Our experiments indicate thatdiscourse usage may affect machine translationbetween some language pairs but not others, andfor particular relations such as CONTINGENCY.Finally, we established the need to identify sen-tences in the source language that would be trans-lated into multiple sentences in English.
Espe-cially in translating from Chinese to English, thereis a large number of such sentences which are cur-rently translated much worse than other sentences.287ReferencesMarine Carpuat and Dekai Wu.
