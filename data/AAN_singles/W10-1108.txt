Although the two languages are linguistically very dissimilar, our hypothe-sis is that there are similarities that are impor-tant and interesting from a language technology point of view.
This may have im-plications when building tools to support pro-ducing and using health care documentation.
We perform a comparative qualitative analysis based on structure and content, as well as a comparative quantitative analysis on Finnish and Swedish Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurs-ing narratives.
Our findings are that ICU nurs-ing narratives in Finland and Sweden have many properties in common, but that many of these are challenging when it comes to devel-oping language technology tools.1 Introduction The purpose of this study1 is to do content and lexical analysis of nursing narratives written in an                                                            1 Our research on the Stockholm EPR Corpus (Dalianis et al, 2009) has been approved by Etikpr?vningsn?mnden i Stock-holm, (the Regional Vetting Board), reference numberIntensive Care Unit (ICU).
The ultimate goal of our research is to define linguistic similarities and language-specific aspects that differentiate clinical narratives in Finnish and Swedish in order to lay groundwork for developing internationally appli-cable language technology solutions and create a framework for characterising and comparing clini-cal narratives.
Free text is handy for information entry but a challenge for information extraction, care handover and other uses of gathered informa-tion.
Language technology can alleviate some of these problems in retrospective analysis by offer-ing a more semantically informed interpretation and abstraction.
However, the most promising po-tential of language technology is to interactively improve, interpret and code during text entry so that the resulting structured, coded, free text can be validated immediately.
The critical bottleneck to-day is namely information handover and reuse, and extensive text is simply not used nor is useful.
In-teractively validated, semantically processed text could be more usable and support abstraction, visualization and query tools for the benefit of cli-nicians, patients, researchers and quality adminis-trators.
2009/1742-31/5.
Our research on the Finnish Corpus (Salan-ter?
et al, 2009) has been approved by the Ethical committee of the Hospital District of South West Finland, reference number 2/2009, ?66.53In this paper, we analyze Finnish and Swedish ICU nursing narratives from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives.
Our data includes textual nursing documentation of adult patients with a protracted inpatient period.
We have chosen ICUs because of their international similarity in decision making (Lauri & Salanter?
2002) and nursing documentation because it covers the entire inpa-tient period.
2 Background2.1 Clinical text Clinical text covers the text documents produced for clinical work by clinicians and occurs in clini-cal information systems.
It is written by clinicians, that is, professionals (physicians, nurses, therapists and other specialist) responsible for patient care.
Its primary purpose is to serve patient care as a summary or hand-over note.
However, clinical text is also written for legal requirements, care continu-ity and purposes of reimbursement, management and research.
Clinical text covers every care phase and, depending on the purpose, documents differ.
Documents that describe the patient?s state, current health problems and socio-medical history are very different from those describing a care plan, its ac-tualization and evaluation of care outcomes.
Again, these differ from diagnostic notes, lab results, ra-diography readings, pathology reports and dis-charge documents that plan further care at discharge.
Finally, clinical text may have been entered in ?real time?, in retrospect, or as a sum-mary, by the bedside or elsewhere.
The enterer can be a clinician, secretary who transcribes a dictate, speech recognition software or another system that generates or synthesizes text, (McDonald 1997, Thoroddsen et al, 2009.).
2.2 Legal requirements for clinical documen-tation in different countries In several countries clinical documentation is based on law.
In Finland, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (Statutes of Finland, 298/2009) defines that to ensure good care, all necessary and wide-ranging information has to be registered in patient records.
In Sweden, the National Board of Health and Welfare has a similar approach (Pa-tientdatalagen 2008:355).
Clinical text should beexplicit and intelligible, and only generally well-known, accepted concepts and abbreviations are allowed to be used.
It should detail adequately the patient?s conditions, care and recovery.
2.3 Special features of ICU and nursing An ICU is an essential component of most large hospitals with high quality care.
ICUs provide care for critically ill patients and focus on condi-tions that are life-threatening and require compre-hensive care and constant monitoring (Webster's 2010).
This task is fairly similar universally.
It is based on optional, international guidelines focus-ing on triage, admission, discharge and education.
This international similarity was evident when nurses?
decision making was studied in Canada, Finland, Northern Ireland, Switzerland, Norway and the USA (Lauri & Salanter?
2002); the study showed that decision making of ICU nurses was the most uniform in different countries when com-pared with nurses working in public health care, psychiatric care, and short and long term care.
Clinical text written by nurses, that is, nursing narratives, both in Finland and in Sweden is based on the care process which stands for gathering in-formation from the patient, setting goals for care, implementing nursing interventions, and evaluat-ing the results of given care.
In Finland, the na-tional standardized documentation model has been implemented with the Finnish care classification (assessment, interventions and outcomes of care) (Tanttu & Ikonen 2007).
The Swedish VIPS model provides a structure for the documentation process with key words that reflect the nursing process (Ehrenberg et al, 1996).
ICU nursing narratives can be lengthy, espe-cially when the patient stay in the ICU is pro-longed.
As much as 60 A4 pages equivalents of written text may be gathered during one period of care.
However, clinicians have somewhat different opinion on how to organize the information they write.
For example, headings are often inconsistent and text under headings can cover a lot of other issues than those directly concerning the given heading.
(Suominen et al, 2009.)
2.4 Related studies Since most of the available clinical documents are in free-text form, a number of stylistically oriented efforts to characterize the data from various angles54have taken place.
This may include various topics, from viewing detailed information about specific items (e.g.
readability, Kim et al, 2007) to identi-fying patterns and structures in order to provide better technology to automatically process the sublanguage (Pakhomov et al, 2006).
The majority of such efforts investigate different aspects of lin-guistic features at a monolingual level, for in-stance, Hahn & Wermter (2004); Tomanek et al, (2007); Chung (2009); Harkema et al, (2009); while for a thorough review of various related is-sues see Meystre et al, (2008).
In the Nordic con-text, Josefsson (1999) discusses Swedish clinical language and shows examples on how verb con-structions in a clinical setting differ from a non clinical setting.
One claim is that the physician unmarks the verb forms for agentivity when writ-ing about the patient and what actions she takes, for example, Patienten hallucinerar [The patient hallucinates] instead of the normal form  Patienten f?r hallucinationer [The patient experiences hallu-cinations].
Helles?
(2005) describes nurses' general use of the language function in the nursing discharge notes.
She finds that the text in the nursing dis-charge notes is information-dense and character-ized by technical terms, and that the use of standardised templates helped nurses improve the completeness, structure and content of the informa-tion.
Comparisons at a monolingual level between written clinical text and lay text has been carried out by Dalianis et al, (2009).
A contrastive com-putational linguistics study was carried out be-tween the Stockholm EPR Corpus (SEPR) and a general language corpus, both written Swedish text.
The findings showed that SEPR contained longer words and that the vocabulary was highly domain-specific.
Other work is described in Ownby, (2005).
Comparing clinical text at a crosslingual level has, to our knowledge, only been done by Borin et al, (2007).
3 Analysis of Finnish and Swedish ICU nursing narratives  The analyzed nursing narratives origin from one ICU in a university-affiliated hospital both in Fin-land and Sweden.
Our inclusion criterion was an ICU inpatient period of at least 5 days and patient's age of at least 16 years.
The Finnish data includes nursing narratives from 514 patient records (496unique patients, 18 rebounds, a patient record is defined as each inpatient period of at least 5 days per patient) between January 2005 and August 2006.
The Swedish data includes nursing narra-tives from 379 patient records (333 unique pa-tients, 46 rebounds) between January 2006 and May 2008.
Since we did not have complete admis-sion and discharge documents from both countries, our analysis is performed on daily nursing narra-tives.
These documents are written by ICU nurses during the actual inpatient period from the patient admission to the discharge.
3.1 Qualitative analysis A manual content analysis was performed by four health care professionals (i.e., three native Finnish speakers knowing Swedish, one Swedish native speaker) and one native Swedish speaking lan-guage consultant.
Three average-sized patient re-cords each from Finland and Sweden were chosen for our analysis (average size 2,389 words for Fin-land and 5,169 words for Sweden).
In the analysis, we considered special features (Table 1) of daily notes both from the structural and content related points of view.
The style and context of both Finnish and Swed-ish text is very similar.
For health care profession-als, and especially with an ICU background, all the texts are intelligible and the meaning of a writer becomes evident from the context even in the pres-ence of numerous linguistic and grammatical mis-takes; almost all the sentences are lacking both grammatical subjects and objects.
It is evident that in both countries, the narratives are written from a professional to a professional in order to support information transfer, remind about important facts, and supplement numerical data.
A feature common for all the six records is that they rarely contain any subjects or objects when nurses are writing about patients.
However, in the Swedish nursing narratives the word patient is used as a subject or object much more often than in the Finnish narratives.
The abbreviation pat.
is mostly used for this reference and she/he is never used for this purpose.
In the whole data, pat.
is 40 percent more common than she/he, which is the most common personal pronoun.
It seems that the word patient or pat.
is used more when the profes-sionals are writing about relatives.
In general, pro-nouns are used infrequently in the narratives, and55Table 1.
Special structural and contextual features of Finnish and Swedish daily ICU nursing narratives.
The original examples are added in ().
I very rarely.
If the reader is not a health care pro-fessional, a risk for confusing the subject (i.e., the patient or nurse) arises.
However, the context makes it almost always clear who is referred to.
Approximately half of the narratives do not contain any verb.
The most common tense is perfect, butwithout the auxiliary has.
When the meaning does not contain a subject it becomes ?unnatural?
to use has.
Instead, the supine form is used, for example slept, lain, and eaten.
Both present and past parti- ciples without be-verb are common, for example, Breathing: Ventilator parameters unchanged.Special features of Finnish narratives   Special features of Swedish narratives   Structure Examples Structure ExamplesHeadings are used in 2 out of 3 patient records.

)Many different abbreviations are used.
The origin of entire word is Swedish, English, Latin, professional or ICU typical.em.
[eftermiddag, afternoon], HR [heart rate], VF [Ven-tricula/Fibrillation, Ventricular Fibrillation]56The use of headings is frequent and good ?
most of the time the content matches the headings (Tables 1 and 3).
In addition, headings are used similarly in the Swedish and Finnish documents.
Most of the time the headings are considered as subjects of the sentence, for example, Consciousness: Unchanged.
Liquor brighter than yesterday.
However, in the use of headings there are two interesting findings: If the headings are to be cho-sen freely, as in the Finnish narratives, nurses tend to use their own headings and hence many syno-nyms or closely related concepts are used; for ex-ample, hemodynamics versus blood pressure and pulse or breathing versus oxidation.
If the headings are obligatory, as in the Swedish narratives, nurses tend to write their observations under the heading which is somehow closest to the subject; for exam-ple, body temperature under circulation or level of sedation under sleep.
For both languages the use of different abbrevia-tions is very common.
Almost every daily nursing narrative included several abbreviations.
Most of the abbreviations are typical for an ICU domain: CVP [central venous pressure], PEEP [Positive End-Expiratory Pressure], EN [Enteral Nutrition], TPN [Total Parenteral Nutrition], pO2 [partial pressure of oxygen], pCO2 [partial pressure of carbon dioxide], MV [Minute Ventilation] and MAP [Mean Arterial Pressure].
From a language technology point of view this means that ICU nurs-ing narratives contain language-independent vo-cabulary.
However, nurses in both countries also use many language dependent abbreviations.3.2 Quantitative analysis The Finnish data set (n=514) was quantitatively analyzed using the morphological analyser FinT-WOL and the disambiguator FinCG, (Lingsoft 2010), and the Swedish data set (n=379) using the GTA, Granska Text Analyzer (Knutsson et al, 2003).
Both data sets are rich in terms of amount of text and vocabulary (Table 2).
It is also clear that the amount of text written per day and patient varies a lot in both data sets.
More complex words were spelled in numerous ways.
For example, the pharmacological substance Noradrenalin had ap-proximately 350 and 60 different spellings in the Finnish and Swedish data sets, respectively.
This problem is part of a more general issue of refer-ence resolution e.g.
when mapping different lexical terms referring to the same concept.
In our quantitative analysis, we have included punctuation characters.
In the Swedish data there was a large amount of html-tags and other format-ting characters, which has a high impact on the total number of tokens (see Table 2).
Moreover, as Finnish is highly inflective, FinCG produces alter-native lemmas, hence it is possible to reduce the sparseness of the data by processing the output by choosing only one alternative lemma (see total number of types in Table 2).
To further illustrate the richness of ICU nursing language, the number of unique bigrams (e.g., ?is not?, ?oxidate well?
and ?night time?
(note: a mis-spelled compound) are the most common ones for Finnish) and trigrams (e.g., ?oxygeneated and ven-tilated?, ?and ventilate well?
are among the most common ones for Finnish) were 368,166 (275,205 after FinCG) and 745,407 (356,307 after FinCG) for Finnish patient records.
For the Swedish data, the number of unique bigrams was 469,455 (344,127 after GTA) and 1,064,944 (905,539 after GTA).
Examples of common Swedish ICU bi-grams and trigrams include ?circulation stabile?, ?during night?, ?in connection with?, and ?with good effect?.
Of the content of Finnish nursing narratives, 11% are verbs, 7% nouns and less than 1% pronouns.
For Swedish nursing narratives, the respective percentages are 11%, 27% and 2%.
One reason for the high numbers for nouns in the Swed-ish data might be due to the large amount of (obligatory) headings relative to the Finnish data (see Table 3).
To support fluent information flow, language technology is needed to strengthen referential con-gruence.
Much of this richness of vocabulary is explained by abbreviations and personal differ-ences in professional jargon.
In particular, abbre-viations were common.
Based on the analysis of the most common words, abbreviations were rela-tively established in Swedish data.
For the Finnish data, abbreviations were less standard but RR, SR, CVP, h, ad, ml, ok, vas.
[vasen, left] and oik.
[oikea, right] were extremely common.
Thus, ref-erential congruence can be strengthened by spell-ing out the most common abbreviations automatically.
Adding topical content headings is another way to support information flow.
Topical content head-ings were mandatory for Swedish data, but no de-57fault headings for Finnish existed.
However, the headings for Finnish were established in terms of content.
In Table 3, we see that the headings for both languages cover similar topics, which indi-cates that the clinical information need is similar for professionals in both countries (and languages).
Thus, we recommend forming a standardized set of headings from which the user can voluntarily se-lect the ones to be used.
This does not exclude add-ing other headings.
Another alternative is to develop language technology for topic segmenta-tion and labeling.
We have promising results from this approach (see, e.g., Suominen 2009).
Temporal expressions (e.g., time, evening, night) were often used in both data sets.
This poses the question of tense analysis of verbs being unneces-sary and the time-related words being enough to imply the needed temporal information.
It is also interesting to note that the negations inte [not, Swe], ingen [none, Swe], ej [not, Swe] and ei [no/not, Fin] are all among the most common types, which is an important property to take into account in information extraction applications.
Furthermore, words regarding the oral cavity, such as breathing and mucus, as well as relations, such as daughter, son, wife, and husband are very com-mon in both data sets.
Inspired by the tf?idf-measure from information retrieval, we also analyzed the most common words in terms of a) the number of patients in whose documents the word was used and b) the number of daily nursing narratives in which the word was used.
Here, we found, in both data sets, that those words that were used for all patients as well as all daily narratives, were very similar in both data sets, and were related to the most com-mon headings, temporal expressions, negations and monitoring (e.g., increase, continue, begin).
The amount of Protected Health Information (PHI) in form of person names was equal in both of the data sets: 1.5 person names per thousand tokens.
This is notable, since this has implications when it comes to integrity issues and reuse of data for research purposes.
FinCG did not recognize 36% of the content of Finnish nursing narratives.
However, words marked as unrecognized by FinCG also included punctuation marks.
In our previous study (see Suominen 2009 and references therein), we tai-lored FinCG by extending approximately 35,000 clinical terms.
The extension not only substantiallyimproved the applicability of FinCG to the health domain but also initiated piloting of our language technology components in an authentic healthcare environment in the fall 2008.
This lead to the re-lease of commercial language technology for Fin-nish health records (Lingsoft 2010).

Comparison of Finnish and Swedish ICU data sets: the most common headings.
For the Finnish data, where default headings were not given, we approxi-mated the amount of heading by using an automated heuristics followed by manual combination of headings with the same meaning.58For Swedish, GTA handles unknown words dif-ferently than FinCG.
However, by comparing the ICU words with a Swedish general language cor-pus (PAROLE, Gellerstam et al (2000)), we found that 69% of the types are not included in PAROLE, which indicates a need for tailoring GTA (or simi-lar tools for Swedish) with domain-specific ICU terms.
4 Conclusions The purpose of this study was to do content and lexical analysis of nursing narratives written in an ICU.
Our findings are that, even though the Fin-nish and Swedish languages are not linguistically closely related, the way of writing clinical nursing ICU narratives in both countries is very similar.
Moreover, the written context made sentences clear for content experts, even though the texts were full of specialized jargon, misspellings, ab-breviations, and missing subjects and objects.
However, these characteristics make clinical text challenging for language technology.
For example coreference resolution as in the case of noradrena-lin.
We have also shown that the content characteris-tics of Finnish and Swedish ICU nursing narratives are very similar.
This implies that developing tools for documentation support in ICUs is not country or language dependant in that respect.
Developing such tools may improve possibilities for informa-tion extraction and text mining, enabling the possi-bilities to reuse the vast amounts of important practice-based information and evidence captured in clinical narratives.
The framework we have in-troduced here could easily be employed in other studies of clinical texts.
6 Future work In the future, we will use the results of this study in developing language technology for Finnish, Swe-dish and other Nordic ICU narratives.
We will study how to identify abbreviations, misspellings and normalize and correct them, by using various distance measures and concept management tech-niques.
We will also study how to automatically identify important parts of text and highlight them.
Furthermore, we are interested in studying text provenance and pragmatics in this particular set-ting.
In addition, we will evaluate the influence ofthese technology components in clinical practice.
We will also address similarities and differences in clinical text written by various professional groups or at other hospital wards and health care units.
Finally, we are eager to seek possibilities to incor-porate laymen's information needs and their inter-action with health care providers into our study.
