One of the main knowledgein Thai traditional medicine is the use of var-ious types of herbs to form medicines.
Ourmain goal is to bridge the gap between the tra-ditional knowledge and the modern biomedi-cal knowledge.
Using text mining and visu-alization techniques, some implicit relationsfrom one source could be used to verify andenhance the knowledge discovery in anothersource.
In this paper, we present our ongoingwork, ThaiHerbMiner, a Thai herbal medicinemining and visualizing tool.
ThaiHerbMinerapplies text mining to extract some salient re-lations from a collection of PubMed articlesrelated to Thai herbs.
The extracted relationscan be browsed and viewed using informationvisualization.
Our proposed tool can also rec-ommend a list of herbs which have similarmedical properties.1 IntroductionIn 1993, the Royal Thai Government instituted theNational Institute of Thai Traditional Medicine, un-der the supervision of the Ministry of Public Health.The goal of the institute is to systematize andstandardize the body of Thai Traditional Medicine(TTM) knowledge.
The main task is to gather, re-vise, verify, classify, and explain the TTM knowl-edge.
There are many ongoing project collaborationto digitize the TTM knowledge, many of which aredocumented on palm leaves.
The digitized contentscontain information on Thai medical herbal formu-lations with the healing properties.
A medical herbalformulation could contain more than one herb andcombined with others for better effect.Apart from the traditional knowledge, todaybiomedical research has advanced into the geneticlevel.
Many researchers have performed in-depthstudies of herbs?
medical properties on disease treat-ment.
The main goal of our research is to com-bine the knowledge from traditional and modernbiomedical research.
Using knowledge from onesource could support the knowledge discovery inanother source.
To assist the researchers in Thaiherbal medicine, we propose ThaiHerbMiner, a textmining and visualizing platform.
ThaiHerbMiner?smain task is to extract and visualize relations amongherbs, properties and other entities.
Our work is sim-ilar to the current ongoing research in mining Tradi-tional Chinese Medicine (TCM) which has gainedincreasing attention in recent years (He et al, 2011;Lukman et al, 2007).2 Design and implementationText mining has become a widely applied techniquefor analyzing biomedical texts (Cohen and Hersh,2005).
The proposed ThaiHerbMiner is designedwith the standard text mining process.
We startedby collecting PubMed articles by using herb namesas keywords.
Currently, we have obtained approxi-mately 18,000 articles related to Thai herbs such asgarlic, curcuma and ginger.Figure 1 shows the text mining process of extract-ing relations from given input texts.
The processincludes sentence segmentation, tokenization, POS186Table 1: The text mining process for extracting relationsfrom input texts.tagging and entity & relation recognition.
We usedOpenNLP1 to perform all text processing tasks.
Forrelation recognition based on syntactic structure, wefocus on a group of causal verbs such as activate, in-duce, inhibit, prevent, regulate and suppress.
Thenthe information visualization based on JavaScript 2is applied to represent the extracted relations.Figure 2 shows an example of a hyperbolic treevisualizing relations between curcuma and other en-tities.
For example, curcuma has the property of in-hibit with NF-kappaB, tumor and cancer.
Figure 3shows an example of a force-directed graph visual-izing similar herbs sharing two entities, cancer andNF-kappaB.
The visualizing result is useful to re-searchers for finding herbs which share similar med-ical properties.3 Conclusion and future workThe results of literature mining can be potentiallyuseful in revealing implicit relations underlying theknowledge in herbal medicine.
In particular, the re-sults can be used in screening the research in Thaiherbal medicine to form a novel hypothesis.
Ournext step is to perform comparative analysis on theknowledge from Thai traditional medicine and theknowledge extracted from the modern research pub-lications.1The OpenNLP Homepage, http://opennlp.sourceforge.net2The JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit, http://thejit.orgTable 2: An example of relations between curcuma andother relevant entities.Table 3: An example of relations among different herbssharing the same entities.ReferencesCohen, Aaron M. and William R.
