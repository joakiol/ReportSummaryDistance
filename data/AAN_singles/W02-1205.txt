Colleagues of theLanguage Archives project at Academia Sinicaprovided data and suggestions.
Any remaining errorsare ours.It is crucial to note that the OLAC standards arenot standards for the language resourcescommunity alone.
They are based on twobroadly accepted standards in the digitalarchives community.
First, the Dublin CoreMetadata Initiative (DCMI) is an open forumengaged in the development of interoperableonline metadata standards that support a broadrange of purposes and business models.
Thereare fifteen Doblin Core Metadata Elements(DCMS) and their qualifiers.
OLACMS extendsthe DC minimally to anwer the needs of thelanguage archives community (Bird, Simons,and Huang 2001).Second, the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) waslaunched in October 1999 to provide a commonframework across electronic preprint archives,and it has since been broadened to includedigital repositories of scholarly materialsregardless of their type.
The OAI infrastructurerequires compliance with two standards: theOAI Shared Metadata Set (i.e.
DCMS), and theOAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol (MHP).
TheOAI MHP allows software services to query arepository using HTTP requests, also animportant feature of the recently hyped SemanticWeb (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/).
Using theOAI infrastructure, the community's archivescan be federated and become a virtualmeta-archive collecting all available information.The federeated structure allows end-users toquery multiple archives simultaneously.Currently, the Linguistic Data Consortium hasharvested the catalogs of over 20 participatingarchives on behalf of OLAC, and created asearch interface which permits queries over all30,000+ records.
A single search typicallyreturns records from multiple archives.
Theprototype can be accessed via the OLACwebsite.In this paper, we trace the version changes ofOLACMS, especially in comparison with other(often related) international standards.
We willthen concentrate on the application of OLACMSto Chinese language resources.
In conclusion,we will make some suggestions for OLACMS toaccount for the characteristics of Chineselanguage archives.2 Mapping with other internationalstandards2.1.Mapping with IMDIISLE Meta Data Initiative (IMDI) is a cousin ofOLACMS.
IMDI proposes a metadata set fornatural language processing under the broaderInternational Standards for LanguageEngineering (ISLE) project.
ISLE isco-sponsored by the European Commission ofthe EU and National Science Foundation of theUSA.
It aims to develop a set of internationallyaccepted standards for natural languageprocessing base on the result of the earlierEuropean standard building project (EAGLES,http://www.ilc.pi.cnr.it/EAGLES96/home.html).On one hand, IMDI is an elaboration ofOLACMS since it deals specifically withrecording sessions.
They can also be considereda complimenting each other since they are bothdevised under the aegis of ISLE.IMDI Metadata Elements for SessionDescriptions, Version 2.5 was completed in June2001.
The elements evolved from the previousEAGLES metadata set described in Wittenburget al (2000).
Both metadata sets share the aim toimprove the accessibility/availability ofLanguage Resources (LR) on the Internet.
Toachieve this goal, they created a browsable andsearchable universe of meta-descriptions similarto those devised by other communities on theInternet.The focus on Session Description was motivatedin Broeder et al (2000).
They observed thatindividual linguistic resource usually exists inclusters of related resources.
For instance, a fieldvideo recording of an informant who describes apicture sequence involves several resources.
Byhis definition, an (linguistic) event that called asession is the top element and there results anumber of related linguistic resources: Videotape, Photographs, Digitised video file, Digitisedphotographs, Digitisations of the images used asstimuli, One electronic transcription file, One ormore electronic analysis files, Field notes andexperiment descriptions (in electronic form).However, since not all linguistic resources cometo existence directly through sessions, hence notall linguistic resources can be described byIMDI.2In principle, IMDI metadata can be mapped toOLAC metadata, just as OLAC metadata can bemapped to DC.
IMDI Team (August 2001)mapped IMDI Session Descriptions with OLAC0.3 Version.
IMDI Team also use existingdescription formalisms used by institutions thatdeal with ?published corpora?
such as [ELRA]and [LDC].
The set of metadata elements thatdescribe ?published corpora?
are called?catalogue?
metadata elements.
The IMDI Team(Gibbon, et al 2001) launched IMDI MetadataElements for Catalogue Descriptions, Version2.1.
It also includes Metadata Elements forLexicon Descriptions.OLACMS has been updated since December2001.
Hence we did an updated comparison andpresent the result in this section.
Note that sinceIMDI is an elaboration of OLACMS, weconcentrate on the IMDI elements that are notspecified in OLACMS and are likely to findwider application.
Please note that the sectioncontains our own recommendations inspired bythe IMDI/OLAC comparison.
We try to add ourmotivation even for the items that are directlyadopted from IMDI.
In terms of OLAC scheme,these suggested revision/addition can beassigned the status of attributes (for use bysub-communities), and can be incorporated intothe OLACMS later if the community find suchaddition necessary.2.1.1.
Controlled VocabularyControlled vocabulary defines the basic conceptsof the metadata set and any addition to thecontrolled vocabulary should be motivated by2 It is possible to conceive language resources suchas lexica and grammars as created through a verylarge set of (non-planned and non-documented)sessions.
But this consideration is beyond the scopeof this paper and will not be pursued further here.the essentiality of the concept.y Controlled Vocabulary for LogicalStructure of linguistic resources: Languageresources come in different forms andvarious units.
A critical piece of informationin cataloguing language resource is adescription of  the composition of theresources.
For instance, any English lexiconcan be conventionally and naturally viewedas composed of 26 sections defined byshared initial alphabet.
Having an element ofLogical Structure: alphabetically orderedwould give us vital information of how tomanipulate the resource.
Other vocabulariessuch as ?sequential chapter?, ?dialogue turns?,or ?sequential phonemes?
would also offercrucial information.
In addiiton, if sequentialdatabase is indeed the future of languageresources, the description of the sequencinglogic will play an essential role.y Add Annotator to [OLAC?Role].
Byannotator, we do not refer to the naturalperson or an automatic program who putsthe tags on.
By annotator we refer to theinstitution that implemented the annotation.This information is crucial since thisannotator 1) has at least partial IP right onthe resource; 2) often set/defines the tagsetstandard adopted (e.g.
Brown, LOB, PennTreeBank).
In other words, annotator candifferentiate a new version of resource oreven identify totally new resource.y Add values of archiving Quality to the refinecontrolled vocabulary of Format.2.1.2.
ElementsOne existing elements may need further refiningwith existing mechanisms.y Refining the element Project: Manylanguage resources are developed under orpartially supported by a project grant.
Fornow, a project can be the value of Creator orContributor.
But just like all other individualcreators and contributors, a project needs tobe described in fuller details.
We need to useattributes to describe the Founder, PI?s, HostInstitutes, etc.
of a project.
An umbrellaproject, such as EAGLES, ISLE, or at a evenmore complex level, ESPRIT, requireselaboration of contributors and fundingtimelines themselves.2.1.3.
Updating and Revising the Attributesy Add sub type to the Space attribute :Coverage of the language resources oftencalls for geographical information.
Hencewe need to define the subtypes that includeContinent, Country, Administrative division,longitude, latitude, address, etc.y Add subtype for non-standard Identifier :There are many sets of identifers are definedlocally and do not follow URL.
In this case,we can add the name of the identifier system(or cataloguer) under schme.
For instance,each libary often has its own set of callnumbers.
Other well-known identifiers arreLCC Catalog No (<Identifiersceeme="LCC"> LCC CatalogNo</Identifier>).
This could also apply towell-established identifiers such as ISSN andISBN.y Although OLAC:Format does not stipulateany refine attributes, however, it is alreadystipulated in DC:Format.
The DC formatrefine has two control vocabulary entries:Medium specifies the material that thecataloguer uses; while extent records sizeand duration of the archive.
We suggest thatOLAC can simply adopt these two refineattributes.2.2.Mapping with LinguisticDocumentation ArchivesIn addition to IMDI Metadata, Gary Holton(2000) also proposes a system of metadata forthe description of language documentationresources following OLACMS.
While thesystem described here should be sufficient forany linguistic resource, it is motivated by thespecific ongoing need to describe linguisticdocumentation materials contained in the AlaskaNative Language Center (ANLC) Archive.Particular attention is paid to description offirst-hand documentation materials such as fieldnotes, grammatical notes, and phonologicaldescriptions, many of which currently exist onlyin written form.
Existing resources are in theprocess of being digitized, and new digitalresources continue to be acquired.
The ANLCcollection presently contains more than tenthousand items.
While much of the materialconsists of original manuscripts of archivalquality, the collection also includes publishedmaterials and materials existing in other archivalcollections, duplicated in whole or in part.
TheANLC Archive thus combines both archival andlibrary functions.The unique need described in Holton (2000) isthat he wants the Metadata set to be appliedsimultaneously to non-digital archives, such asmanuscript, reel-to-reel cassettes, CD recordingsetc.
This can be done by adopting theDC:Format refine attribute of Medium.
In orderto descibe the archives more felicitously, wealso need to add speaker, interviewer Holder,and Guardian to the value of controlledvocabulary of refine of Creator and Contributor.However, there does not seem to be anystraightforward way to transfer Target Dialect.2.3.SummaryBased on the two comparison of differentmetadata sets, we found that the DC qualifiercan be applied effectively to solve the bridgingand conversion problems between differentDC-based extension metadata sets.
This shouldbe exactly what OLACMS design has in mind.The attributes that were not stipulated inOLACMS 0.4, if found in DC and motivated byactual need to describe language resources, canbe easily adopted.
One way to ensure theversatility is to keep all DC attribute inOLACMS, even though some of the attributesmay be dormant and not actively applied now.Another issue worth noting is that anycataloguer may add sub-elements to achive morecomprehensive description.
However, suchaddition should, follow the extension andadaptability of the DC.3 Use Controlled Vocabulary forTemporal and Geographic LocationConstable, and Simons (2000) listed all thecauses for language changes, which basicallyinvolve the change in the temporal-spatiallocation of the poeple.
Since China used adifferent calendar system until late in early 20thcentury, all inherent temporal description ofinherited Chinese archives do not conform to thecurrent DC standard.
In order to identifyWestern and Chinese chronology, we maystipulate that the primary types of the schemeelement to be Western (W_Calendar) or Chinese(C_Calendar).
We may also add otherchronological methods, such as lunar or solarcalendar.
The sub_type of Chinese calendar willthen include time, dynasty name, state name,emperor?s reign, and the reign name of theemperor.
Take the Academia Sinica AncientChinese Corpus for example.
Its coverage isEarly Mandarin Chinese, and will marked assuch in the metadata: <Coveragescheme="C_calendar/phase">EarlyMandarin</Coverage>.
The users will be able to refer to ahistorical linguistic calendar and find that thetime equals to the dynasties of Yuan, Ming, andChing.
And will be able to convert the time towestern calendar using the conversion table of[Sinica Calendar].When Coverage has a spatial refinement, alocation can have different names because of theunit used in cataloguing, as well as because oftemporal or regional and linguistic variaions.Hence, the spatial value of Coverage must bedefined by a scheme.
A scheme must stipulatetemporal reference as unit of catalogue.
Forinstance, the Sinica Corpus covers the languageof the Republica of China in Taiwan.
Itsmetadata will have the following value<Coverage refine= "spatial" scheme="ROC/Taiwan">.
As mentioned above [SinicaCalendar] offers conversion table for the past2000 years between Chinese and Westerncalendars.
As for the units for cataloguing ofspatial location, OLAC 0.4 Version adopts[TGN]( Getty Thesaurus of GeographicalTerms).
And many other digital archives followAlexandria Digital Library Feature TypeThesaurus [ADL].
The ADL type thesaurus havebeen adopted by the digital archives project inTaiwan and translated into Chinese byAcademia Sinica Metadata Architecture andApplication Team [Sinica MAAT].4 Applying OLACMS to LanguageArchives in TaiwanEach text in Academia Sinica Balanced Corpusof Modern Chinese (Sinica Corpus) is markedup with five textual parameters: Mode, Genre,Style, Topic and Medium.
These are importanttextual information that needs to be cataloguedin metadata.
The following shows how wetransfer and represent these (legacy) textualinformation to OLACMS:4.1.Mode and GenreTable 1 The relation between Mode and Genre ofSinica Corpus(Ckip Technology Report 93-05)Mode GenreWritten ReportagesCommentaryAdvertisementLettersAnnouncementFictionProseBiography & DiaryPoemManualwritten-to-be-spoken ScriptSpeechSpoken Conversationspoken-to-be-written analectsSpeechMeeting MinuteWe add a refine attribute under Type.
Mode isadded in the controlled vocabulary as Primarytype, and Genre is added as sub type.
Forinstance, a recorded and transcribed speech iscatalogued as <Type code="Sound"refine="spoken-to-be-written/Speech"/>.4.2.StyleThere are four styles that are differentiated inSinica Corpus: Narrative, Argumentative,Expository, and Descriptive.
We add a newrefine attirbute under Descriptio, with Style as acontrolled vocabulary.
For instance, a diary willbe catalogued as: <Description refine="Style">Narration </Description>.4.3.MediumSinica Corpus specifies the media of thelanguage reources as: Newspaper, GeneralMagazine, Academic Journal, Textbook,Reference Book, Thesis, General Book,Audio/Visual Medium, Conversation/Interview.We may also add other audio-video media suchas CD,V8?etc.
As mentioned above, this can beeasily described with DC: Format refineattribute of Medium.4.4.TopicThe Topic parameter of Sinica Corpus has thesame content as the element Subject.
This cansimply be transferred through a table.Table 2 Topic of Sinica Corpus(Ckip TechnologyReport 93-05)Primary SubPhilosophy Thoughts | Psychology | Religion |NaturalScienceMathematics | Astronomy | Physics |Chemical | Mineral | Creature |Agriculture | Archeology | Geography |Environmental Protection | EarchScience | Engineering |SocialSciencesEconomy | Finance | Business &Management | Marketing | Politics |Political Party | Political Activities |National Policy | InternationalRelations | Domestic Affairs | Military|Judicature | Education |Transportation | Culture | History |Race | Language | MassMedia | PublicWelfare | Welfare | Personnel Matters |Statistical Survey | Crime | Calamity |Sociological Facts |Arts Music | Dance | Sculp | Painting |Photography | Drama | Artistry |Historical Relics | Architecture |General Arts |General/LeisureTravels | Sport | Foods | MedicalTreatment | Hygine | Clothes | Movieand popular arts | People | Information| Cunsume | Family |Literature Literary Theory | Criticism | Otherliterary work | Indigenous Literature |Childern?s Literature | Martial ArtsLiterature | Romance |An example for the adoptation follows: for aSinica Corpus text with a Topic of Arts and asub-topic of Music, it will be catalgued asfollows: <Subject>Arts/Music</Subject>.4.5.Additional Controlled Vocabularyy Proofreader: Since both manually andautomatically digitized materials must beproofread to ensure quality, we suggest that[OLAC-Role] be enriched by a new value:Proofreader.
For inherited texts with no IPrestrictions, this may be the criticalinformation piece of information to identifywho is the rightful owner/creator of theelectronic version.y There are many Medium values old(procelain, rubbing, bamboo engraving, silkscroll, etc.)
and new (DVD, MO, ZIP...etc).Hence the controlled vocabulary of attributessuch as Medium and SourceCode often hasquick and drastic changes.
In order tomaintain versatility and comprehensivecoverage, this set of controlled vocabularymust be open and allows each participant toregister, subject to the approval by OLAC.5 Language IdentificationConstable and Simons (2000) noted that acomputer, unlike human beings, cannotautomatically identify the language of a text thatit is reading yet.
Hence metadata must play acentral role in identifying the language that eachresource uses.
For instance, Malay and Englishuses the same 26 letters.
And Archaic Chinese2000 years ago and Modern Mandarin can beexpressed by pretty much the same set ofChinese characters.
These are all differentlanguages and need to be identified before alanguage resource can be used.
SIL (SummerInstitute of Linguistics, in its white-paperidentified five major issues for languageidentification: Change, Categorization,Inadequate definition, Scale, and Documentation.SIL has produced an online searchable database:Ethnologue that provides a comprehensivesystem of language identification covering morethan 6,800 languages.
This is adopted by OLACas an obvious improvement over the very smallset covered in DC.Bird et al (2001), however, pointed out someproblems of coverage if the Enthlogue system isadapted without further means of enrichment.The three broad categories of problem are:over-splitting, over-chunking and omission.Over-splitting occurs when a language variety istreated as a distinct language.
For example,Nataoran is given its own language code (AIS)even though the scholars at Academia Sinicaconsider it to be a dialect of Amis (ALV).Over-chunking occurs when two distinctlanguages are treated as dialects of a singlelanguage (there does not appear to be anexample of this in the Ethnologue's treatment ofFormosan languages).
Omission occurs when alanguage is not listed.
For example, two extinctlanguages, Luilang and Quaquat, are not listed inthe Ethnologue.
Another kind of omissionproblem occurs when the language is actuallylisted, but the name by which the archivistknows it is not listed, whether as a primary nameor an alternate name.
In such a case the archivistcannot make the match to assign the proper code.For instance, the language listed as Taroko(TRV) in the Ethnologue is known as Seediq byAcademia Sinica; several of the alternate nameslisted by the Ethnologue are similar, but nonematches exactly.The above problems may prove to be astumbling block for archives that attempt tointegrate linguistic resources with GIS(Geographic Information System), such as the[Formosan Language Archive] at AcademiaSinica.
A GIS-based language atlas will mostlikely be very concerned with fine-grainedchanges and variations among languages anddialects within a geographic area.
In other words,these kind of archives may either discover yetunrecorded language or sub-languagedifferentiations or need even finer classificationin Ethnologue or any language identificationsystem.
Hence the solution proposed in Bird etal.
(2001) of allowing local languageclassification systems to register must beimplemented under OLAC.6 ConclusionWe looked at a couple of OLAC derivedmetadatasets, as well as applied OLAC version0.4.
to three different language archives inTaiwan.
We proposed some suggestions forenriching of OLACMS based on the study.There are two general directions to bear in mind.First, as the number and complexity of languageresources becomes higher and higher, the needto have a uniform standard or to easy access tothe owner of each resource becomes evengreater.
Therefore, we envision that the elementof Creator, Contributor etc.
needs furtherelaboration, which may include practicalinformation such as email addresses etc.
Second,as the language archives get richer, the need tonote language variation grows even bigger.Simple language identification of allotting aresource a unique language code is not enough.There will be great need to infer linguisticrelations from these codes.
Since it is impossibleto build a complete reportiore of resources forall languages, it is very often that a resourcesfrom the closest related language must beborrowed.
The representation of linguisticrelations will be the next challenge of languageidentification.ReferencesI.
