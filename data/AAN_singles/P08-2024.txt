Al-though it is possible for us to employ image-based methods to identify visually similarcharacters, the resulting computational costscan be very high.
We propose methods foridentifying visually similar Chinese charactersby adopting and extending the basic conceptsof a proven Chinese input method--Cangjie.We present the methods, illustrate how theywork, and discuss their weakness in this paper.1 IntroductionA Chinese sentence consists of a sequence of char-acters that are not separated by spaces.
The func-tion of a Chinese character is not exactly the sameas the function of an English word.
Normally, twoor more Chinese characters form a Chinese word tocarry a meaning, although there are Chinese wordsthat contain only one Chinese character.
For in-stance, a translation for ?conference?
is ????
?and a translation for ?go?
is ???.
Here ????
?is a word formed by three characters, and ???
is aword with only one character.Just like that there are English words that arespelled similarly, there are Chinese characters thatare pronounced or written alike.
For instance, inEnglish, the sentence ?John plays an important rollin this event.?
contains an incorrect word.
Weshould replace ?roll?
with ?role?.
In Chinese, thesentence ?????????????
contains anincorrect word.
We should replace ????
(a placefor taking examinations) with ????
(a market).These two words have the same pronunciation,shi(4) chang(3) ?, and both represent locations.
Thesentence ?????????????
also con-?
We use Arabic digits to denote the four tones in Mandarin.tains an error, and we need to replace ????
with????.
????
is considered an incorrect word,but can be confused with ????
because the firstcharacters in these words look similar.Characters that are similar in their appear-ances or in their pronunciations are useful forcomputer-assisted language learning (cf.
Burstein& Leacock, 2005).
When preparing test items fortesting students?
knowledge about correct words ina computer-assisted environment, a teacher pro-vides a sentence which contains the character thatwill be replaced by an incorrect character.
Theteacher needs to specify the answer character, andthe software will provide two types of incorrectcharacters which the teachers will use as distractersin the test items.
The first type includes charactersthat look similar to the answer character, and thesecond includes characters that have the same orsimilar pronunciations with the answer character.Similar characters are also useful for studiesin Psycholinguistics.
Yeh and Li (2002) studiedhow similar characters influenced the judgmentsmade by skilled readers of Chinese.
Taft, Zhu, andPeng (1999) investigated the effects of positions ofradicals on subjects?
lexical decisions and namingresponses.
Computer programs that can automati-cally provide similar characters are thus potentiallyhelpful for designing related experiments.2 Identifying Similar Characters with In-formation about the Internal StructuresWe present some similar Chinese characters in thefirst subsection, illustrate how we encode Chinesecharacters in the second subsection, elaborate howwe improve the current encoding method to facili-tate the identification of similar characters in thethird subsection, and discuss the weakness of ourcurrent approach in the last subsection.2.1 Examples of Similar Chinese CharactersWe show three categories of confusing Chinesecharacters in Figures 1, 2, and 3.
Groups of similar93characters are separated by spaces in these figures.In Figure 1, characters in each group differ at thestroke level.
Similar characters in every group inthe first row in Figure 2 share a common part, butthe shared part is not the radical of these characters.Similar characters in every group in the secondrow in Figure 2 share a common part, which is theradical of these characters.
Similar characters inevery group in Figure 2 have different pronuncia-tions.
We show six groups of homophones thatalso share a component in Figure 3.
Characters thatare similar in both pronunciations and internalstructures are most confusing to new learners.It is not difficult to list all of those charactersthat have the same or similar pronunciations, e.g.,????
and ???
?, if we have a machine readablelexicon that provides information about pronuncia-tions of characters and when we ignore special pat-terns for tone sandhi in Chinese (Chen, 2000).In contrast, it is relatively difficult to findcharacters that are written in similar ways, e.g.,???
with ??
?, in an efficient way.
It is intriguingto resort to image processing methods to find suchstructurally similar words, but the computationalcosts can be very high, considering that there canbe tens of thousands of Chinese characters.
Thereare more than 22000 different characters in largecorpus of Chinese documents (Juang et al, 2005),so directly computing the similarity between im-ages of these characters demands a lot of computa-tion.
There can be more than 4.9 billioncombinations of character pairs.
The Ministry ofEducation in Taiwan suggests that about 5000characters are needed for ordinary usage.
In thiscase, there are about 25 million pairs.The quantity of combinations is just one ofthe bottlenecks.
We may have to shift the positionsof the characters ?appropriately?
to find the com-mon part of a character pair.
The appropriatenessfor shifting characters is not easy to define, makingthe image-based method less directly useful; forinstance, the common part of the characters in theright group in the second row in Figure 3 appearsin different places in the characters.Lexicographers employ radicals of Chinesecharacters to organize Chinese characters into sec-tions in dictionaries.
Hence, the information shouldbe useful.
The groups in the second row in Figure2 show some examples.
The shared components inthese groups are radicals of the characters, so wecan find the characters of the same group in thesame section in a Chinese dictionary.
However,information about radicals as they are defined bythe lexicographers is not sufficient.
The groups ofcharacters shown in the first row in Figure 2 haveshared components.
Nevertheless, the shared com-ponents are not considered as radicals, so the char-acters, e.g., ??
?and ??
?, are listed in differentsections in the dictionary.2.2 Encoding the Chinese CharactersThe Cangjie?
method is one of the most popularmethods for people to enter Chinese into com-puters.
The designer of the Cangjie method, Mr.Bong-Foo Chu, selected a set of 24 basic elementsin Chinese characters, and proposed a set of rulesto decompose Chinese characters into elementsthat belong to this set of building blocks (Chu,2008).
Hence, it is possible to define the similaritybetween two Chinese characters based on the simi-larity between their Cangjie codes.Table 1, not counting the first row, has three?

?Table 1.
Cangjie codes for some characters94sections, each showing the Cangjie codes for somecharacters in Figures 1, 2, and 3.
Every Chinesecharacter is decomposed into an ordered sequenceof elements.
(We will find that a subsequence ofthese elements comes from a major component of acharacter, shortly.)
Evidently, computing the num-ber of shared elements provides a viable way todetermine ?visually similar?
characters for charac-ters that appeared in Figure 2 and Figure 3.
Forinstance, we can tell that ???
and ???
are similarbecause their Cangjie codes share ????
?, whichin fact represent ??
?.Unfortunately, the Cangjie codes do not ap-pear to be as helpful for identifying the similaritiesbetween characters that differ subtly at the strokelevel, e.g., ??????
and other characters listedin Figure 1.
There are special rules for decompos-ing these relatively basic characters in the Cangjiemethod, and these special encodings make the re-sulting codes less useful for our tasks.The Cangjie codes for characters that containmultiple components were intentionally simplifiedto allow users to input Chinese characters moreefficiently.
The longest Cangjie code for any Chi-nese character contains no more than five elements.In the Cangjie codes for ???
and ??
?, we see ?????
for the component ??
?, but this componentis represented only by ????
in the Cangjie codesfor ???
and ???.
The simplification makes itrelatively harder to identify visually similar charac-ters by comparing the actual Cangjie codes.2.3 Engineering the Original Cangjie CodesAlthough useful for the sake of designing inputmethod, the simplification of Cangjie codes causesdifficulties when we use the codes to find similarcharacters.
Hence, we choose to use the completecodes for the components in our database.
For in-stance, in our database, the codes for ??
?, ???,??
?, ??
?, and ???
are, respectively, ??????,??????
?, ???????
?, ?????????
?, and ???????
?.The knowledge about the graphical structuresof the Chinese characters (cf.
Juang et al, 2005;Lee, 2008) can be instrumental as well.
Considerthe examples in Figure 2.
Some characters can bedecomposed vertically; e.g., ???
can be split intotwo smaller components, i.e., ???
and ???.
Somecharacters can be decomposed horizontally; e.g.,???
is consisted of ???
and ???.
Some haveenclosing components; e.g., ???
is enclosed in???
in ???.
Hence, we can consider the locationsof the components as well as the number of sharedcomponents in determining the similarity betweencharacters.Figure 4 illustrates possible layouts of thecomponents in Chinese characters that wereadopted by the Cangjie method (cf.
Lee, 2008).
Asample character is placed below each of theselayouts.
A box in a layout indicates a component ina character, and there can be at most three compo-nents in a character.
We use digits to indicate theordering the components.
Notice that, in the sec-ond row, there are two boxes in the second to therightmost layout.
A larger box contains a smallerone.
There are three boxes in the rightmost layout,and two smaller boxes are inside the outer box.Due to space limits, we do not show ?1?
for thisouter box.After recovering the simplified Cangjie codefor a character, we can associate the character witha tag that indicates the overall layout of its compo-nents, and separate the code sequence of the char-acter according to the layout of its components.Hence, the information about a character includesthe tag for its layout and between one to three se-quences of code elements.

Annotated and expanded code95tated and expanded codes of the sample charactersin Figure 4 and the codes for some characters thatwe will discuss.
The layouts are numbered fromleft to right and from top to bottom in Figure 4.Elements that do not belong to the original Canjiecodes of the characters are shown in smaller font.Recovering the elements that were droppedout by the Cangjie method and organizing the sub-sequences of elements into parts facilitate the iden-tification of similar characters.
It is now easier tofind that the character (?)
that is represented by??????
and ??????
looks similar to thecharacter (?)
that is represented by ????
and??????
in our database than using their origi-nal Cangjie codes in Table 1.
Checking the codesfor ???
and ???
in Table 1 and Table 2 will offeran additional support for our design decisions.In the worst case, we have to compare ninepairs of code sequences for two characters thatboth have three components.
Since we do not sim-plify codes for components and all componentshave no more than five elements, conducting thecomparisons operations are simple.2.4 Drawbacks of Using the Cangjie CodesUsing the Cangjie codes as the basis for comparingthe similarity between characters introduces somepotential problems.It appears that the Cangjie codes for somecharacters, particular those simple ones, were notassigned without ambiguous principles.
Relying onCangjie codes to compute the similarity betweensuch characters can be difficult.
For instance, ??
?uses the fifth layout, but ???
uses the first layoutin Figure 4.
The first section in Table 1 shows theCangjie codes for some character pairs that are dif-ficult to compare.Due to the design of the Cangjie codes, therecan be at most one component at the left hand sideand at most one component at the top in the layouts.The last three entries in Table 2 provide an exam-ple for these constraints.
As a standalone character,???
uses the second layout.
Like the standalone??
?, the ???
in ???
was divided into two parts.However, in ??
?,  ???
is treated as an individualcomponent because it is on top of ???.
Similarproblems may occur elsewhere, e.g., ????
and????.
There are also some exceptional cases; e.g.,???
uses the sixth layout, but ???
uses the fifthlayout.3 Concluding RemarksWe adopt the Cangjie alphabet to encode Chinesecharacters, but choose not to simplify the code se-quences, and annotate the characters with the lay-out information of their components.
The resultingmethod is not perfect, but allows us to find visuallysimilar characters more efficient than employingthe image-based methods.Trying to find conceptually similar but con-textually inappropriate characters should be a natu-ral step after being able to find characters that havesimilar pronunciations and that are visually similar.AcknowledgmentsWork reported in this paper was supported in partby the plan NSC-95-2221-E-004-013-MY2 fromthe National Science Council and in part by theplan ATU-NCCU-96H061 from the Ministry ofEducation of Taiwan.ReferencesJill Burstein and Claudia Leacock.
