Proceedings of the ACL 2014 Workshop on Language Technologies and Computational Social Science, page 2,Baltimore, Maryland, USA, June 26, 2014.c?2014 Association for Computational LinguisticsCreating and Destroying Party BrandsJustin GrimmerStanford UniversityAbstractParty brands are central to theories of Congressional action.
While previous work assumes thata party?s brand?its long run reputation?is a direct consequence of the content of legislation, inthis presentation I show how partisans from both parties use public statements to craft their ownparty?s reputation and to undermine their opponents party.
The incentive to craft and destroybrands varies across legislators, creating systematic distortions in who contributes to partisanbranding efforts, what is said about a party?s brand, and when partisan criticism becomes salient.To demonstrate the construction of party brands I use new collections of newsletters from Con-gressional offices, along with press releases, floor speeches, and media broadcasts.
Across thediverse sources, I show that ideologically extreme legislators are the most likely to explain theirparty?s work in Washington and the most likely to criticize the opposing party?particularly whentheir is an opposing party president.
Extreme legislators also engage in more vitriolic criticismof the opposing party, particularly when opposing presidents are unpopular.
The result is thatparties in rhetoric appear even more combative and polarized in public debate outside Congressthan inside Congress.2
