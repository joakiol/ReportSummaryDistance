LAW VIII - The 8th Linguistic Annotation Workshop, pages 99?104,Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24 2014.Annotating descriptively incomplete language phenomenaFabian Barteld, Sarah Ihden, Ingrid Schr?der, and Heike ZinsmeisterInstitut f?r GermanistikUniversit?t HamburgVon-Melle-Park 620146 Hamburg, Germany{ fabian.barteld, sarah.ihden, ingrid.schroeder, heike.zinsmeister }@uni-hamburg.deAbstractWhen annotating non-standard languages, descriptively incomplete language phenomena (EA-GLES, 1996) are often encountered.
In this paper, we present examples of ambiguous formstaken from a historical corpus and offer a classification of such descriptively incomplete lan-guage phenomena and its rationale.
We then discuss various approaches to the annotation ofthese phenomena, arguing that multiple annotations provide the most appropriate encoding strat-egy for the annotator.
Finally, we show how multiple annotations can be encoded in existingstandards such as PAULA and GrAF.1 IntroductionIn grammatical annotations, a lack of ambiguity is of great benefit: The more distinctive the relationshipbetween a token and its morphological and syntactic attributes, the more successful and reliable the an-notation.
However, especially in corpora of non-standard language varieties annotators are confrontedwith a significant number of cases of doubt and ambiguity.
This problem has been more relevant in se-mantic and syntactic analyses than in PoS tagging and morphological annotation, and consequently hasalready been addressed in the former processes (Kountz et al., 2008; Bunt, 2007; Spranger and Kountz,2007; Regneri et al., 2008) and incorporated into tools such as SALTO (Burchardt et al., 2006).
Withrespect to corpora of non-standard languages, ambiguous forms must be taken into consideration in mor-phosyntactic tagging as well.
This has been confirmed by current corpus projects of historical varietiesof German ?
for example, the ?MERCURIUS Corpus of Early New High German?
(ENHG1) (Pauly etal., 2012) and the ?Historical Tagset?
(HiTS) (Dipper et al., 2013), which provide different options fordealing with ambiguities at the level of part of speech.
Below we will discuss examples of ambiguitiesat the morphological level.Within the extensive field of non-standard language annotations, we have concentrated on historicallinguistics, showcasing the kinds of ambiguities that historical corpus linguists must confront and howthey can be managed.
Historical corpus linguistics based on annotation necessarily faces the challenge ofavoiding circular argumentation.
The description of a historic language must be based on the annotatedtexts of the corpus, since they are the only sources of linguistic material in historical grammatography.However, no annotation of the material can be accomplished without a basic knowledge of the languageand its structure.
Thus, an annotator confronted with a dubious case cannot know whether it is actu-ally a case of ambiguity in the language system or whether the grammatical categories adopted for theannotation do not fit the grammatical system of the non-standard language.
Transferring the annotationstandards developed for a standardized language such as written New High German (NHG) to a historicalcorpus might at first seem tempting, but this process would conceal the actual grammatical characteristicsof the language to be described.This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

enTable 2Types of descriptively incomplete language phenomena2 Cases of descriptively incomplete phenomenaThe project ?Reference Corpus Middle Low German/ Low Rhenish (1200?1650)?2 transliterates andgrammatically annotates the Middle Low German (GML) texts from which we take our examples.
Be-cause GML is a non-standardized language that is not well described, ambiguous forms occur frequently,and accurately interpreting them is a matter of high priority for any annotation.
First, with regard to nounsand pronouns, GML?s case syncretism3 should be mentioned.
For personal pronouns, in particular thesyncretism of the dative and accusative forms in the first- and second-person singular and plural leads toproblems in annotation.
However, in this section, we concentrate on the third person.Table 1 illustrates the many identical forms of third person personal pronouns that are used for sev-eral morphological feature values.
Moreover, it reveals the distribution of case syncretism across thethree different genders of the third-person singular.4 While the neuter paradigm shows syncretism inthe nominative and accusative forms, for the feminine pronouns there are ambiguous forms not only fornominative and accusative but also for genitive and dative.
The masculine paradigm includes a partialsyncretism of dative and accusative for the pronoun en (?him?
).In addition, there is syncretism in the dative forms of the third-person singular masculine and neuterand in the third-person plural.
Hence, in example (1),5 the word en could be either masculine or neuter ifthere is no context providing reliable information on the gender of the referent, or it could even be plural(where there is syncretism between the three genders).
If en is plural or neuter, it can only be a dativeform, but if it is masculine, it could be either dative or accusative.

(BuxtehEv, Joh 11,4)Even where the context provides additional information, often not all ambiguities can be resolved.
Inexample (1), the antecedent of en provides information on gender (masculine) and number (singular), butthe ambiguity with respect to case can only be resolved in a local context ?
here, the prepositional phrase.The problem is that in GML the preposition dor (?through?)
can govern different cases.
Consequently,the case ambiguity in (1) cannot be resolved.There are many other examples of ambiguous forms, for instance, the gender of nouns or the inflectionparadigm of verbs.
For all these cases of ambiguity the annotation should provide as much grammaticalinformation on a given form as possible.2The ?Referenzkorpus Mittelniederdeutsch/ Niederrheinisch (1200?1650)?
(?Reference Corpus Middle Low German/ LowRhenish?, or ?ReN?
), supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG)) and in development since February/ March2013 at the universities of Hamburg and M?nster, is part of the ?Corpus of Historical German Texts?, together with thecorpora ?Altdeutsch?
(Old German), ?Mittelhochdeutsch?
(Middle High German), and ?Fr?hneuhochdeutsch?
(Early NewHigh German).
More information on the structure of ReN can be found in Nagel and Peters (In print) and on the websitewww.referenzkorpus-mnd-nrh.de.
For information on the annotation used in ReN and possible grammatical analyses, seeSchr?der (In print).3Baerman (2006) asserts that ?syncretism refers to the situation when a single inflectional form corresponds to multiplemorphosyntactic feature values?
(363).
With respect to the feature case, this means that identical forms are used for differentcases, e.g., for dative and accusative.4The order of the pronouns was chosen for presentational reasons.
The example en that we refer to in this paper is shown inbold italics.5This glossing is based on the Leipzig Glossing Rules (http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/pdf/LGR08.02.05.pdf).1003 Types of descriptively incomplete language phenomenaIn cases of descriptively incomplete language phenomena such as those described above, the annotator(which could be a tool or a human) is unable to unambiguously assign an analysis to the language data.This inability can have various causes.
Consequently, EAGLES (1996) distinguishes between two typesof ?descriptively incomplete phenomena?
: underspecification and ambiguity.
In the first case, the inabil-ity arises because ?the distinction between the different values of an attribute is not relevant?.
The secondcase is characterized as ?the phenomenon of lack of information, where there is uncertainty between twoor more alternative descriptions?.
For both of these types, EAGLES provides subtypes; however, in thecase of ambiguity, these subtypes also differ with respect to the reason for the uncertainty.
In one subtype,the apparent ambiguity could be resolved given more information.
In the other, the uncertainty resultsfrom a real ambiguity in the language or the given text and therefore cannot be resolved.
Consequently, wepropose a differentiation between three types of descriptively incomplete language phenomena that canoccur during annotation: (i) uncertainty, i.e., incomplete information due to infrequent occurrence in thetraining material (automatic annotation), incomplete treatment in annotation guidelines, or an incompleteunderstanding of the language system (manual annotation); (ii) underspecification, i.e., incomplete in-formation due to an undistinguished feature of the language system; and (iii) ambiguity, i.e., incompleteinformation due to an ambiguity in the language data.Returning to example (1), further analyses could provide evidence that the preposition dor (?through?
)unambiguously takes the accusative case, such that this would represent a case of uncertainty.
In Englishpersonal pronouns, there is no distinction made between dative and accusative, both of which are repre-sented by the objective case (Obj) (Quirk et al., 1985).
If this were also true for GML, the example wouldbe a case of underspecification.
However, it could also represent a true case of ambiguity.
As long asthis categorization is unclear, the types cannot be distinguished.Table 2 summarizes the distinction between these three types.
Although all of them result in the samesituation for the annotator (machine or human), they differ with respect to the true analysis, which isunknown to the annotator; it is therefore impossible for him or her to definitively assign a tag to thetoken, as exemplified in Table 2.
In situations of uncertainty or underspecification, an unambiguous,true analysis exists.
In the case of uncertainty, it is a matter of redefining the annotation guidelines tohelp the annotating system to find this true analysis.
In the case of underspecification, the tagset is toofine-grained to provide the true analysis.
Only by adjusting the tagset would the annotator be able todetermine the true analysis.
Adjustments to the annotation guidelines and the tagset during the process ofannotation can be accomplished through the use of an annotation development cycle such as theMATTERmethodology (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012, 23?32).
In the case of ambiguity, however, both analysesare true.
They should be retrievable for further interpretation and thus should both be assigned to thetoken.Optimally, the different types of incomplete information ?should be distinguishable by different mark-up?
(EAGLES, 1996).
But as we have argued, when annotating historical languages (or less-studiedlanguages in general), it is not always possible to decide at the time of annotation whether there is anambiguity, an underspecification, or an uncertainty, as all three result in the same problem for the an-notator.
Thus, in many cases, the annotator can only distinguish between the three types (if at all) afterthe annotation has been completed and the quantitative results based on the annotated data have becomeavailable.
The three types must therefore be dealt with similarly during the annotation process, and thepossible interpretations should be retrievable from the annotations.
Consequently, the annotator shouldhave the possibility to assign any number of annotations to every possible feature.
This would requirespecial tools to create and retrieve these annotations, but existing standards to encode annotations arealready flexible enough to allow annotations.
Some examples are shown in the next section.4 Encoding multiple annotations in markup standardsThis section presents three formats for encoding multiple annotations of descriptively incomplete struc-tures in XML markup.
We return to the ambiguous GML pronoun en ?him/ it?
introduced in example (1)in Section 2.101Our first option is T?PP-D/Z DTD (Ule, 2004), an inline-XML specification that was designed torepresent a ranked list of multiple competing tagger outputs resulting from ensemble tagging.
Using thesame kind of structure, all possible interpretations of the pronoun en could be encoded and made availablefor further analysis and disambiguation.The other two options are generic XML-standoff formats that represent annotations as directed acyclicgraphs: PAULA (Dipper, 2005; Chiarcos et al., 2008), derived from early drafts of the Linguistic Anno-tation Framework (LAF) (Ide and Romary, 2004), and GrAF (Ide and Suderman, 2007), a more recentspecification of the LAF.
Each level of annotation is represented separately, such that features are relatedto annotation objects (?markables?)
only by links.
Markables themselves are defined on the basis of texttokens or other markables.
Multiple markables can be related to the same token, as each markable isuniquely identified by its ID.
These options also allow us to encode all interpretations of en.6In certain cases, there are dependencies between multiple ambiguous features.
Concerning ?en?, if thegender is Neut, the case is not ambiguous, but if the gender is Masc, the case could be either Dat or Acc(cf.
Table 1).
The above strategies do not allow us to encode these dependencies.
However, the genericLAF-derived standoff formats can be employed to do this because they also allow us to define labels foredges, such that they can be annotated and typed.
Kountz et al.
(2008) propose an extension to GrAF inwhich such dependencies are explicitly modeled.
As depicted in Figure 1, we make use of this property tocombine a choice structure with a collect structure.
In this way, each token correlates with one MorphSetobject that can be instantiated by a set of MorphInst objects, thereby explicitly encoding the dependenciesbetween the multiple ambiguous features of gender and case.Token...

with typed edges5 Conclusion and OutlookIn order to avoid circular argumentation and to reveal the actual grammatical characteristics of the lan-guage under investigation, historical corpus linguistics must go beyond simply adapting the rules of astandardized language, both by disambiguating ambiguous forms but also by encoding ambiguities.
Bymeans of data taken from the ?ReN?
corpus, we have demonstrated that in historical language corpora, an-notators must deal with descriptively incomplete language phenomena.
Furthermore, they need to decidewhat type of phenomena these are, i.e., real ambiguities, underspecifications or uncertainties.
Often thisdecision is impossible at the time of the annotation, since all three types result in the same problem for theannotator, as discussed in Section 3.
In Section 4, we have shown that in markup formats such PAULA orGrAF, the straightforward encoding of multiple annotations and their dependencies is possible.
Neverthe-less, linguists still lack sufficient tools to create, query, and visualize the multiple annotations representedin the underlying data structure.
For these reasons, corpus projects such as ?ReN?
are currently unable touse multiple annotations, even though this is the most appropriate encoding strategy for the grammaticalannotation of historical languages.6In addition, PAULA offers a multiFeat structure (Zeldes et al., 2013, 14f.)
for linking sets of fully-specified features to onemarkable.
However, each piece of information must be unambiguous.102AcknowledgementsWewould like to thank Kerstin Eckart for very helpful discussion and suggestions, and also Claire Bacherfor improving our English.
