Proceedings of the Workshop on Lexical and Grammatical Resources for Language Processing, pages 137?146,Coling 2014, Dublin, Ireland, August 24 2014.The Lexicon-Grammar of Italian IdiomsSimonetta VietriDepartment of Political,Social and CommunicationSciencesUniversity of Salerno, Italyvietri@unisa.itAbstractThis paper presents the Lexicon-Grammar classification of Italian idioms that has been constructed onformal principles and, as such, can be exploited in information extraction.
Among MWEs, idioms arethose fixed constructions which are hard to automatically detect, given their syntactic flexibility andlexical variation.
The syntactic properties of idioms have been formally represented and coded in bi-nary matrixes according to the Lexicon-Grammar framework.
The research takes into account idiomswith ordinary verbs as well as support verb idiomatic constructions.
The overall classification counts7,000+ Italian idioms.
In particular, two binary matrixes of two classes of idioms will be presented.The class C1 refers to the Verb + Object constructions, whereas the class EPC refers to the preposi-tional constructions with the support verb essere.
Pre-constructed lexical resources facilitate idiomsretrieval both in the case of "hybrid" and "knowledge-based" approaches to Natural Language Pro-cessing.1 IntroductionIdioms, and multi-word expressions in general, have always been "a pain in the neck", as Sag et al.
(2001) state in the title of their paper.
The formal representation and the construction of a computa-tional linguistic model of idioms is not an easy task as shown by Gazdar et al.
(1985), Pulman (1993),Abeill?
(1995), Villavicencio et al.
(2004), Muzny and Zettlemoyer (2013) to name a few of the many(computational) linguists who have carried out research on this topic.It has always been pointed out that the main problem concerning the automatic analysis of idiomsis the difficulty to disambiguate such constructions which are ambiguous by definition (Fothergill andBaldwin 2012, Li and Sporlender 2009, Fazly et al.
2009, McShane and Nirenburg 2014).
However,given the flexibility of idioms, a more basic and still unsolved problem has to be taken into account:that is, the extraction and annotation of such constructions (Fellbaum 2011).As Fazly et al.
(2009, p. 61) point out "despite a great deal of research on the properties of idioms inthe linguistics literature, there is not much agreement on which properties are characteristics of theseexpressions".
The distinction drawn by Nunberg et al.
(1994) between idiomatic phrases and idiomati-cally combining expressions has been adopted by most of the research on idioms.
However, manyproblems still remain and they are due to two basic reasons.
On one hand, idioms can be consideredlexical units, given the fact that their "special meaning" is associated to a particular verb and one ormore particular complements.
On the other hand, idioms syntactically behave as non-idiomatic con-structions.
Passive is the syntactic construction more frequently analyzed by the linguistic research onidioms since it involves the occurrence of the fixed object to the left of the verb.
However, idiomsshow a great deal of other syntactic constructions where the fixed object may not necessarily occur inpostverbal position (see Vietri 2014, forthcoming).It is for these peculiarities that idioms have also aroused the interest of the psycholinguistic re-searchers who have advanced several hypothesis on the processing of idioms (Swinney and Cutler,This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

According to Gross, thebasic syntactic unit is not the word but the simple or elementary sentence, and the Lexicon-Grammarof a language is organized into three main components: free sentences, frozen sentences (or idioms),support verbs sentences (Gross 1981, 1998).
For each component, Gross and his colleagues built ex-haustive classifications, systematically organized and represented by binary matrixes (named Lexicon-Grammar tables), where each syntactic and/or distributional property is marked "+" or "-" if acceptedor not by a certain lexical unit.
In the Lexicon-Grammar methodology, idiomatic and non-idiomaticconstructions are built according to the same formal principles.
The difference between these twotypes of constructions mainly concerns the distribution: idioms show a higher level of restricted distri-bution than non-idioms.
The French Lexicon-Grammars are available at http://infolingu.univ-mlv.fr/english/.A classification of English idioms and phrasal verbs has been carried out according to the sameformal principles and criteria, respectively, by Freckleton (1985) and Machonis (1985).
A Lexicon-Grammar of European Portuguese idioms has been built by Baptista (2005a, 2005b).The Lexicon-Grammar classification of Italian idioms has been implemented on the basis of Gross'methodology.
It includes more than 30 Lexicon-Grammar classes of idioms with ordinary verbs (sec.2) and support verbs (sec.
3), for a total of more than 7,000 lexical entries1.
The binary matrixes arecreated in Excel format.2 The Lexicon-Grammar of Italian Idioms with Ordinary VerbsThe Lexicon-Grammar of idioms using ordinary verbs includes 12 classes for a total of 3,990 entries(sec.
2.1, Table 1).
Each class of idioms contains those constructions which share the same definitionalstructure.
In the Lexicon-Grammar framework, the definitional structure is identified on the basis ofthe arguments required by the operators (see Harris 1982).
In the case of idioms, the operator consistsof the Verb and the Fixed element(s), while the argument may be the subject and/or a free comple-ment.
This section shows only the main differences between the idioms' classes C1 and CAN.For example, idioms in (1) and (2) have two different definitional structures.
On one hand, an idiomsuch as tagliare la corda in (1) is an operator that requires only one argument, i.e.
the subject.
On theother hand, an idiom such as rompere le balle in (2) is an operator that requires two arguments, thesubject and the noun Amy within the prepositional complement.
The prepositions a and di alternateand can be considered fixed:1.
Amy ha tagliato la corda   "to sneak off"Amy-has-cut-the-rope2.
Joe ha rotto le balle (a + di) Amy  "to annoy sb.
"Joe-has-broken-the-balls-(to + of)-AmyIdioms such as (1) have been listed and analyzed in a class named C1, that counts about 1,200 entries.Furthermore, C indicates the "constrained" or "fixed" noun and 1 refers to its position in the sentence,in this case, the object position.
These idioms have only one argument, that is the (non-fixed noun) insubject position.
The definitional structure of the class C1 is N0 V C1 where N indicates the free noun,V the verb and C, as previously stated, the fixed element.
The subscripts 0 and 1 indicate the positionof the noun within the sentence in a linear order, in this case, the subject and the object position.Idioms such as (2) have been listed and analyzed in the class named CAN, that counts 320 entries.The definitional structure of this class is N0 V C1 (a + di) N2, since these idioms have two arguments,1 Vietri (1984) includes the very first classification of Italian idioms.
Since then, the classification has been widely en-riched, updated and completely re-examined.
For a semantic study of Italian idioms, see Casadei (1996).
A Lexicon-Grammar classification of Verb-particle constructions has been developed by Guglielmo (2013).
From a different per-spective, Masini (2005) provides a synchronic and diacronic analysis of Italian verb-particle constructions found in acorpus.138i.e.
the subject N0 and the noun N2.
The alternation of the prepositions a and di is represented betweenbrackets, and the "+" sign indicates "either/or".Each class, formally represented by a table in the form of a binary matrix, contains a specific num-ber of idiomatic entries associated with a specific number of distributional and syntactic properties.
Inparticular, each row of the matrix corresponds to an idiom, and each column to a property (or a con-struction).
If the idiom accepts that particular property, a "+" sign is placed at the intersection betweenthe row and the column; otherwise a "-" sign occurs.As a sample of this type of lexical resource, I will give an excerpt of the class C1 in Figure 1.
Thecentral non-numbered columns indicate the "part of speech" assigned to each lexical element that con-stitutes the idiomatic construction.
In an idiom like non alzare un dito (lit.
not lift a finger), the nega-tion non is obligatory.
On the other hand, the si-pronominal form is obligatory in idioms like leccarsi ibaffi (lit.
lick-si the moustaches).
The determiner can be Definite (Def), Indefinite (Ind), or null (Zero).As previously pointed out, V refers to the verb and C to the fixed noun.The properties from [1] to [3] indicate the distribution of N0, i.e.
the subject.
It can be expressed by[?
human] noun or a by a sentence [Ch F].The distributional property [4] indicates if C1 is expressed by a body-part noun, whereas the mor-phological property [5] indicates if C1 can be in the plural form.
Property [4] showed that 1,700+ idi-oms involve a body-part noun, at least the 24% of the overall classification.
Property [5] is a usefulpiece of information because it refers to the possible variation of the fixed noun and, consequently, ofthe determiner.

The Class C1139The syntactic properties are numbered from [6] to [10].
In particular, [6] and [7] refer, respectively, tothe unaccusative (3b) and the adjectival passive (3c) constructs in which some idioms may occur, as inthe following:3a.
Liv ha dipanato la matassa   "to solve a problem"Liv-has-unraveled-the-skein3b.
La matassa si ?
dipanataThe skein-si-is-unraveled3c.
La matassa ?
dipanataThe-skein-is-unraveledProperties [8] and [9] indicate two more sentence structures in which idioms may occur.
In particular,[8] refers to a sentence structure involving the verb avere ('to have') as in (4b):4a.
Gli operai incrociano le braccia  "to go on strike"The-workers-cross-the-arms4b.
Gli operai hanno le braccia incrociateThe-workers-have-the-arms-crossedThe syntactic property [9] indicates a particular structure where the verb is in the infinitive form andintroduced by the preposition da, as in (5b):5a.
Joe ingoi?
un rospo   "to swallow a bitter pill"Joe-swalled-a-toad5b.
Joe ha un rospo da ingoiareJoe-has-a-toad-to-swallowNotice that, in the constructions defined by properties [6]-[9], C1 does not occur in its canonical posi-tion but to the left of the verb.Property [10] concerns the possibility of having a nominalization, as in (6b).
Finally, the morpho-syntactic property [11] shows the formation of a VC compound, as in (7b).
The VC compound is ex-plicitly indicated in the corresponding column.6a.
Joe ha alzato la testa   "to rebel"Joe-has-raised-the-head6b.
L'alzata di testa (di + che ha fatto) JoeThe-raising-of-the-head (of + that-has-made)-Joe7a.
Joe vende fumo    "to be a snake oil salesman"Joe-sells-smoke7b.
Joe ?
un vendifumoJoe-is-a-sell.smoke2.1 The Classes of Idioms with Ordinary VerbsTable 1 contains all the classes of idioms with ordinary verbs.
The first column indicates the name ofthe Lexicon Grammar class, while the second column refers to the definitional structure of the idiomsbelonging to the corresponding class.
The third column contains an idiomatic example for each class.Finally, the fourth column refers to the number of idioms listed in each class.
The last class of Table 1,i.e.
PVCO, contains those idioms where the fixed verb is followed by a comparative clause introducedby come2.The figures in the fourth column are to be taken as an approximate quantity, since this is an ongo-ing research.
Therefore, the classes are subject to updating.
Although approximate, the figures are animportant piece of information because they show the idioms' distribution throughout the syntacticpatterns.2 See also De Gioia (2001).140LG-class Sentence structure Example N.C0 C0 V ?

Idioms with Ordinary Verbs3 The Lexicon-Grammar of the Italian Idiomatic Support Verb ConstructionsIdioms may be not only formed by an ordinary verb but also by support verbs, the most common ofwhich are, in Italian, avere ('to have'), essere ('to be'), fare ('to make').
The main difference betweensupport verbs (hereafter SV) and ordinary verbs constructions is linked to their meaning.
That is, sup-port verbs are semantically empty, while ordinary verbs are not.
Therefore, support verbs are not pred-icates.The idiomatic constructions formed by such verbs show a high degree of lexical and syntactic flex-ibility due to the semantic "emptiness" of the support verb.
Such a flexibility of SV idioms is shownby (a) the alternation of support verbs with aspectual variants, (b) the production of causative con-structions, (c) the deletion of the support verb itself that can trigger the formation of complex nominalgroups and adverbials.The Lexicon-Grammar of SV idioms (sec.
3.1, Table 2) includes 16 classes for a total of about3,300 entries.
I will present one of the classes defined by the general structure N0 essere Prep C ?,where it is the prepositional complement that is fixed and necessary to sub-categorize a possible fur-ther argument ?, as in the following3:8.
Nelly ?
al settimo cielo   "to be in seventh heaven"Nelly-is-at-the-seventh-sky9.
Joe ?
ai ferri corti con Nelly "to be at loggerheads with sb.
"Joe-is-at-the-short-irons-with-NellyIn example (8), the fixed prepositional complement PC does not require a further argument besides thesubject, whereas a free prepositional complement PN is required in the case of (9).
Therefore, idiomslike (8) and (9) have been listed in two different classes, respectively, EPC and EPCPN, where E in-dicates the verb essere ('to be'), P the preposition, C indicates the constrained noun, and N the freenoun.
Figure 2 is an excerpt of the class EPC which includes 500+ entries.3 The Lexicon-grammar of the French ?tre Prep constructions has been built by Danlos (1988).
The Portuguese con-structions were analyzed by Ranchod (1983).
A first classification of the Italian essere Prep constructions has been builtby Vietri (1996).
This early classification has been completely revised.141[1]N0=+hum[2]N0=-hum[3]N0=CheFV Prep Prep-Det C1 [4]C1=body-part[5]Vsup=Stare[6]Vsup=Restare-Rimanere[7]Vsup=Diventare[8]Vmt =Andare[9]Vcaus=Mandare[10]Vcaus=Mettere[11]Vcaus=Ridurre[12]Vop=Avere+ + - essere in - ballo - + + - - - + - -+ - - essere in - bestia - + + - + + - - -- + - essere sotto - chiave - + + - - - + - -+ - - essere - sulla corda - + + - - - + - -+ - - essere - alle corde - + + - - - + - -- + - essere - al dente + - + - - - - - -+ - - essere in - erba - - + + - - - - -+ + - essere - con i fiocchi - - + + - - - - -+ - - essere - fuori dai gangheri - + + - + + - - -+ - - essere - sul lastrico - + + - + + + + -+ + + essere fuori - luogo - - + - - - - - -+ - - essere fuori - mano + + + - - - - - -+ + - essere a - nudo - - + - - - + - -+ + - essere sott' - occhio + + + - - - - - +- + - essere - alle porte - + + - - - - - -+ - - essere - sulle spine - + + - - - + - -+ - - essere - al tappeto - + + - + + + - -- + - essere - sul tappeto - + + - - - + - -+ - - essere in - gamba + - + + - - - - -+ - - essere - al verde - + + - - - + + -Figure 2.
The class EPCThe distributional properties [1]-[4] have been previously illustrated (sec.
2, Figure 1).
The propertiesfrom [5] to [8] indicate the possibility for the EPC constructions to occur with verbs other than essere.The verbs considered are stare4, in [5], restare and rimanere ('remain'), in [6], diventare ('become,get') in [7].
The property [8] indicates that a construction with the verb of motion andare ('to go') maybe acceptable.However, the acceptability of all these constructions is lexically dependant, as in the following ex-amples:10.
Nelly (sta+ resta + *diventa + va) al settimo cielo   "to be in seventh heaven"Nelly-(stays + remains + *becomes + goes)-at-the-seventh-sky11.
Joe (*sta + resta + diventa + *va) in gamba  "to be smart"Joe-(*stays + remains + becomes + *goes)-in-legEPC constructions can also enter complex sentence structures with causative verbs (see properties [9]--[10]) such as mandare ('send'), mettere ('to put'), ridurre ('make'), as in the following:4 I will literally translate this verb as "to stay".
However, there is no equivalent in English since this verb is to be foundin Romance languages like Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.14212.
Joe (mand?
+ *mise + *ridusse) Nelly al settimo cielo "to be in seventh heaven"Joe-(sent  + *put + *reduced)-Nelly-at-the-seventh-sky13.
Joe (mand?
+ mise + ridusse) Nelly sul lastrico  "to be on the skids"Joe-(sent + put + reduced)-Nelly-on-the-pavementFinally, property [12] indicates that the link operator (see Gross 1981) avere ('to have') may producean acceptable sentence, as in (14b):14a.
La situazione in Ukraina ?

As a generalrule, the classes of idioms with the verb essere start with E, those ones with the verb avere startwith A, and finally, those classes involving the verb fare start with F. The only exception is theclass PECO which refers to the idioms of comparison where the verb essere is followed by aclause introduced by come6.LG class  Sentence structure Example N.EPC N0 essere Prep C1 essere sulle spine 530EPCModifN0 essere Prep Adj C1N0 essere Prep C1 Adjessere di vecchio stampoessere in mani sicure130EPCPN N0 essere Prep C1 Prep N2essere all'oscuro di Nessere ai ferri corti con N140EPCPC N0 essere Prep (C Prep C)1essere nelle mani di Dioessere al passo con i tempi115EAPC N0 essere Adj Prep C1 non essere dolce di sale 100PECO N0 essere Adj come C1 essere sordo come una campana 360AC N avere C1  avere polso, avere (buon) occhio 80ACA N avere C1 Adj avere la memoria corta 400ACXCN0 avere C1 Prep C2<=> C1 di N1 essere Prep C2avere i nervi a fior di pelle<=> i nervi di N sono a fior di pelle180ACPN N0 avere C1 Prep N2 non avere la testa di N 50ACPC N0 avere C1 Prep C2 avere il cervello tra le nuvole 200FC  N0 fare C1 fare melina, fare lo gnorri 300FCPN  N0 fare C1 Prep N2 fare le bucce a, fare man bassa di N 300FCDC  N0 fare (C di C)1 fare l'arte dei pazzi 80FCPC  N0 fare C1 Prep C2 fare un buco nell' acqua 220FPC(PN)  N0 fare Prep C1 (E + Prep N2) fare sul serio, farsi in quattro per N 50Total   3,235Table 2.
Idioms with Support Verbs5 See Vietri (2014, forthcoming) for the complete classification.6 For the French classification of idiomatic comparisons see Gross (1984).1434 Annotating and Parsing IdiomsThe Lexicon-Grammar classes of idioms can be exploited by the hybrid as well as the symbolic ap-proach to Natural Language Processing.
Some experimentation in this direction has already been car-ried out by Machonis (2011), who used NooJ to retrieve and disambiguate English phrasal verbs.
NooJis an NLP application developed by Silberztein (2003) that relies heavily on linguistic resources.NooJ has been used to carry out experimentation on some of the Lexicon-Grammar classes of Ital-ian idioms.
The experimentation, still in progress, concerns the annotation and parsing of idioms.
Thisapplication allows the construction of lexicons/dictionaries whose entries contain information such asthe distributional and syntactic properties indicated in the Lexicon-Grammar classes.
The Lexicon-Grammar classes of idioms can be converted in a NooJ dictionary of idioms.
This dictionary, whichcontains thousands of entries, has to be linked to a grammar that describes the syntactic behaviour ofidioms.
By applying to a text such a dictionary/grammar pair, NooJ successfully annotates and parsesidioms, also in case the constituents Verb + Fixed element(s) are discontinuous.
An example of this isthe sentence John ha vuotato subito il sacco (lit.
John-has-immediately-emptied-the bag, "to spill thebeans"), where the underlined adverb occurs between the verb and the fixed object.However, the current NooJ version does not yet handle easily the syntactic flexibility and the lexi-cal variation of idioms 7.5 ConclusionThe Lexicon-Grammar classes of idioms are a manually-built linguistic resource that provides infor-mation about variation and flexibility of idioms.
These classes, being formally coded, constitute aninvaluable linguistic resource that can be used for research in (psycho)linguistics, and computationallinguistics.
The overall classification, as illustrated in Tables 1 and 2, outlines the syntactic patterns ofthe idiomatic constructions.
This is a piece of information that can be regarded as the syntactic map ofItalian idioms8.
Furthermore, the lexico-syntactic information provided by the idioms' classes can alsointegrate the automatic Machine Translation evaluation methods9.The Lexicon-Grammar classes of idioms can be exploited by the hybrid as well as the symbolic ap-proach to Natural Language Processing.
Some experimentation in this direction has already been car-ried out by Machonis (2011) and by Vietri (2014, forthcoming).
Both authors used the knowledge-based system NooJ.
On the other hand, Baptista et al.
(2014) used the Lexicon-Grammar classes ofPortuguese idioms to test the hybrid system STRING.Further experimentation will be conducted to evaluate the benefit of using the LG distributionaland syntactic information in order to extract idioms from corpora.
However, very huge corpora (con-sisting of documents in an informal language style) are needed, together with powerful tools able toperform complex searches on massive textual data.ReferencesAnne Abeill?.
