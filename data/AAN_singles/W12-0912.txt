Proceedings of the EACL 2012 Workshop on Computational Models of Language Acquisition and Loss, pages 51?60,Avignon, France, April 24 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsPhonologic Patterns of Brazilian Portuguese:a grapheme to phoneme converter based studyVera Vasil?vskiFederal University of SantaCatarina, Emerging LinguisticProductivity Lab (LAPLE),Florianopolis, Brazilsereiad@hotmail.comAbstractThis paper presents Brazilian Portuguesephoneme patterns of distribution,according to an automatic grammar rules-based grapheme to phoneme converter.The software Nhenh?m (Vasil?vski,2008) was used for treating data: writtentexts which were decoded intophonologic symbols, forming a corpus,and subjected to a statistical analysis.Results support the high level ofpredictability of Brazilian Portuguesephonemes distribution, the consonant-vowel syllabic pattern as the mostcommon, as well as the stress patterndistribution 'CV.CV#.
The efficiency of aphoneme-grapheme converter basedentirely on rules is also proven.
Theseresults are displayed and discussed, aswell as some aspects of Nhe-nh?mbuilding.1 IntroductionThe challenging problem of alphabetic systemsdiscovery, i.e., its relationship with the spokenlanguage (Silva Neto, 1988) is the issuediscussed, illustrating it with empirical evidence,presenting statistically the Brazilian Portuguesepatterns of phoneme distribution, and how theyare reflected in the written system.
In addition,questions dealing with prosody and syllable arealso addressed, with some comments about thespelling agreement that is to be effected in 2013,the goal of which is to standardize thePortuguese spelling in seven countries where it isspoken.The patterns presented were obtained from theanalysis of an automatic grammar rules-basedgrapheme to phoneme converter designed fordealing with Brazilian Portuguese, the softwareNhenh?m (Vasil?vski, 2008), which is also asyllable parser.
The presentation is preceded by adescription of the relation between thePortuguese written system and the phonologicalone and the main problems they cause in findingoptimal solutions for writing the programalgorithms.
Some of the principles of thePortuguese spelling system together with someof the theories that guided the converterconstruction support the discussion.2 Spoken and Written LanguageScience and also History (Silva Neto, 1988) statethat the oral verbal language developsspontaneously whenever traces of humanizationare found, whereas the written language is aninvention, the intensive and systematic learningof which is necessary in most cases (Scliar-Cabral, 2003a).
Linguistic evolution is not just afact of phonological and phonetic change,however, changes often start as pronunciationmodifications (Silva Neto, 1988).
Consequently,distinctions fade and disappear, causinghomonyms, which must be avoided, so weintroduce new words to maintain theindependence of signs (Malmberg, 1993).Languages are in perpetual change, although inapparent repose.
The distance between the oraland the written system, which is conservativeand subject to the literary traditions, becomesincreasingly high.In alphabetic systems, one or more letters(graphemes) represent the phonemes, resulting inunits that distinguish meaning in writing (thesecond articulation), but this representation is nota one-to-one, by virtue of the distance betweenthe oral and the written systems alreadymentioned.
Another divergent principle alsooccurs: the etymological.
Since many spellingsare based upon etymological origin (Scliar-Cabral, 2003a) writing does not reproduce the51oral system faithfully.
Both spoken and writtenlanguage have their own laws and ways.2.1 Phonetics and PhonologyWhile Phonetics is concerned with describingspeech sounds (phones) from the point of view oftheir articulation, perception and physicalproperties, Phonology studies the phonemes of alanguage, that is, classes of sounds, abstractlyrepresented in the minds of a linguisticcommunity.
In this way phonemic transcriptionis broad (general), covering all possible phoneticvariations of each phoneme.
The aim ofPhonology is deep invariance, while Phoneticssearches surface variations.There are many schools of Phonology, themost important of which is the Prague Circle,which introduced the functionalist approach,meaning, in this case, that only phoneticdifferences which cause differences of meaningare relevant.
Perception of those differences is apsychic one and implies disregarding any similarphonetic difference which does not provoke adifference meaning.
Phonology makesabstraction of the physical properties of sounds,which are the field of Phonetics.
QuotingGlossematics, Phonetics studies the expression ofsounds (substance of sounds in their multiplicityand variation), and Phonology studies the form(relations, classes, abstract nature, which takesplace in the substance) (Malmberg, 1993).Since the alphabetic principles are based onthe phoneme representation, any automaticprogram must depart from the phonologicaldescription of the respective language, which isthe case of the Brazilian Portuguese phonologicaltranscription here used.2.2 Brazilian Portuguese spelling systemAlthough the rules of registering stress may seemcomplicated, they facilitate reading.
We willpresent and discuss here only some of the mostimportant rules regarding the spelling system.1Portuguese is a syllable-timed language, i.e.,the vast majority of Portuguese words hasstressed syllable, leaving aside clictics, which areonly a few, but are the most frequently used(prepositions and accusative pronouns).However, the stressed syllable is not signaled forthe most frequent stressed words (the ones which1Portuguese spelling accent system is showed in details anddiscussed in Vasil?vski (2008).receive stress on the penultimate syllable) sinceOccam?s razor principle was adopted, registeringonly the stress of less frequent stressed words.The criteria for graphically signaling Portuguesewords are the following: a) in which syllablestress falls; b) is it a vowel or consonant thatends the word; c) signaling the differencebetween diphthong and hiatus.Signaling graphically stress is a powerfulhallmark for the reader, because it guideshim/her to match the written word with itsrepresentation in the mental oral lexicon.
Onlymeta-language is helpful whenever the diacriticis absent for recovering on which syllable stressfalls.The stress diacritics of Portuguese are acute(?chap?u?
?
hat) and circumflex (?voc??
?
you).A morphosyntactic diacritic is used for signalingthe overlap of the preposition ?a?
with thedefinite article ?a?/?as?, or with thedemonstrative pronoun ?a?/?aquela(s)?,?a?/?aquele(s)?.
For instance, ?fui ?
casa daMaria?
(I went to Mary?s home), ?vamos ?quelelugar?
(Let?s go to that place).In Portuguese, stress may relate to the last,penultimate, antepenultimate or, more rarely, tothe fourth last syllable of the phonological word,for example, ?n?pcias?
(wedding) ?
/ ?
nu.p ?.si.aS/ (C?mara Jr., 1986).
The phonologicalword in Portuguese is well defined, and itsdistinctive mark is stress (C?mara Jr., 1986).
Thestress position reveals, clearly, the distinctivevowel (C?mara Jr., 1997).The position of stress does not depend on thephonemic structure of the word.
There are noword endings in Portuguese imposing certainstress, but there is a termination which is morefrequent, although such frequency isindeterminable phonologically (C?mara Jr.,1997).
However, the Portuguese characteristicstress occurs in the penultimate syllable, whichgives Portuguese a bass rhythm.
Nevertheless,Brazilian Portuguese has more words with stresson the last syllable than European Portuguese,because it incorporated words from the Africanand Indigenous languages that lived togetherwith the Portuguese colonialists in the past.Portuguese words main stress is registeredgraphically according to the pattern frequency inthe language.
The most frequent word pattern is:?
'C(C)V.C(C)V(s)#, where the last vowel mustbe ?a?, ?e?, ?o?.
These words do not receive anywritten signal, e.g., ?mesa?
(table) ?
/?me.za/,52?escreves?
(you write) ?
/eS.
?kr?.viS/, ?livro?
(book) ?
/?liv.ru/.
Secondly is the pattern?
'C(C)V(s)#, where the last written vowel mustbe ?a?, ?e?, ?o?.
If the last vowel is [-high, -low],it receives a circumflex, e.g., ?av??
(grandfather)?
/a.
?vo/; if the last vowel is [+low], it receivesan acute signal, e.g., ?sof??
(sofa) ?
/so.?fa/,?caf?s?
(coffes) ?
/ka.
?f?S/, ?vov??
(grandma)?
/vo.
?v?/.On the other hand, the stress of words endingwith ?i?
and ?u?
?
for instance, ?abacaxi?
(pineapple) and ?caju?
(cashew) ?
falls on thelast syllable ?
/a.ba.ka.?
?i/ and /ka.?
?u/, unlessthey have accent mark on another syllable, e.g.,?j?ri?
(jury),?b?nus?
(bonus) ?
/?
?u.ri/, /?bo.nuS/.In Brazil, in most of sociolinguistic varieties,the unstressed final vowels spelled with ?e?
and?o?
neutralize in favor of /i/ and /u/, respectively,when pronounced.
This neutralization happensbecause, if the penultimate or antepenultimatesyllable of the word is more intense, the lastsyllable is reduced: ?gente?
(people) ?
/???.ti/,?carro?
(car) ?
/?ka.
?u/.Also, stress of words ending in decrescentdiphthongs fall on the last syllable: ?plebeu?
(commoner) ?
/ple.
?bew/, ?ramal?
(branch) ?/?a.
?maw/, ?uni?o?
(union) ?
/u.ni.?
?w/, unlessthey have accent mark on another syllable:?p?nei?
(pony) ?
/?po.ne?
/.
In Portuguese, allwords stressed in the antepenultimate syllable aresignaled in writing: ?n?mero?
(number), ?c?lida?
(warm ?
fem.
), ?z?nite?
(zenith) ?
/?nu.me.ru/,/?ka.li.da/, /?ze.ni.ti/.Another characteristic that makes thePortuguese system of signaling the stressedsyllable in the written system effective comesfrom the fact that it was guided by phonologicalintuition.
One example is a morphosyntacticdiacritic exclusive of certain verbs ?
?ter?
(tohave), ?vir?
(to come), and derivatives ?
in thethird person plural (?t?m?, ?v?m?)
(Scliar-Cabral, 2003a), thus indicating plural, since thirdperson singular is ?tem?
and ?vem?).
Thepronunciation, however, does not change: ?vem?,?v?m?
?
/v?
?/, /?v?
?/.In summary, the Portuguese written system ofsignaling stress is based on the principle ofeconomy (Occam?s razor), considering that themost frequent pattern /'CV.CV(s)/ is the one thatdoes not receive a diacritic.
Thus, it facilitatesdecoding, although it may seem morecomplicated for coding, especially as it is notproperly understood by teachers and, therefore,by students.
The system has lost some of thequalities based on phonological intuition, due todiachronic changes in the oral system and thelack of spelling rules based on those changes: the1991 agreement made the situation worse.
Wewill come back to this point.2.3 The Portuguese syllableThe syllable is the superior unit in whichphonemes (vowels and consonants) combine towork on enunciation (C?mara Jr., 1997).
Syllabledivision is deeply studied by Phonology.
Itsstructure types characterize languages.
The basicphonemic structure is the syllable, not thephoneme (Jakobson, 1967 apud C?mara Jr.,1986).
The syllable in Portuguese can beunderstood as a set of positions (slope (onset),core (nucleus), and decline (coda)) to beoccupied by specific phonemes.
The core of thesyllable is the only essential position inPortuguese and should be always occupied by avowel, which is the predominant sound of thesyllable.
The slope is occupied by consonantsand may not be present in the syllable.
Furtherrestrictions are made to what may be in decline,which accepts only certain consonants and thesemi-vowels /j/, /w/, but can also be empty.
InPortuguese the so called free or open syllables,which are the ones that end with a vowel,predominate.
This kind of syllables includessimple syllables (V) and open complex (CV).Locked or closed syllables are those ending inconsonants (VC, CV(C)C).
They are much lessfrequent in Portuguese, and there are severeconstraints, limiting which are the possibleconsonants in this position (C?mara Jr., 1986).The most complex syllables in Portuguese arethe ones that end with two or three phonemes:CCVVC (?claus.tro.fo.bi.a?
?
/klawS.tro.fo.
?bi.a/), CCVCC (?trans.mu.ta.??o?
?/traNS.mu.ta.
?
sawN/ ~ /tr?S.mu.ta.
?
s?w/), andCVCCC (?gangs.te.ris.mo?
?
/gaN.g ?
S.te.
?riS.mu/ ~ /g?.g ?S.te.
?
riS.mu/).
In the last twoexamples, we can see that there can be twophonological interpretations: the first oneconsiders the existence of nasal consonantal codaand disregards the existence of nasal vowelswhile the second considers the existence of nasal53vowels and the absence of a nasal consonantphoneme in coda position (what the secondposition admits is the existence of phoneticvariants, conditioned by the subsequentconsonant).
Nhenh?m spelling syllable parsingfavors the second position.
The sequence CCCVis not valid for Brazilian Portuguese.
Thepronunciation of a foreign word like stress is[is.
?tr?.si], so its written form is ?es-tresse?.In general, the Portuguese syllabledelimitation is clear, but there are three caseswhere it is floating.
There are three groups ofvowels contexts in which an unstressed and highvowel may be considered as a semi-vowel,belonging to a diphthong, or as a vowel, forminga hiatus (C?mara Jr., 1997): a) /i/ or /u/ precededor followed by another unstressed vowel(?variedade?, ?saudade?, ?cuidado?
), b) /i / or /u/followed by a stressed vowel (?piano?, ?viola?
),and c) /i/ or /u/ followed by unstressed vowel atthe word ending (?
?ndia?, ?ass?duo?
).Phonetically, one can understand these asdiphthongs or hiatuses in free variation with nodistinctive opposition.
Phonologically, however,there is a syllabic not significant variableboundary.
In Brazilian Portuguese, they arebetter understood as hiatus (/va.ri.e.?da.di/,/pi.?
?.nu/, /vi.?
?.la/, /?
?.di.a/, /a.
?si.du.u/), except inthe cases in which the second vowel is ?i?
ou?u?, which are better understood as diphthongs:/saw.
?da.di/, /ku?.
?da.du /.The above explanation is part of the theorythat sustains Nhenh?m rules.3 Methodology, discussion and resultsIn this section, we present the methodologyapllied to the work corpus and the automaticdecoder Nhenh?m, due to the close relationbetween them.
For the same reason, also wepresent the results and discuss them.3.1 The decoder Nhenh?m: presentationThe word that gives the program its name,?nhenh?m?, comes from the Tupi language ?spoken by several Indian tribes who lived andcontinue living in Brazil ?
and means theendlessly repetition of a movement made by thelips, a sound, as the voice, therefore, an analogueof the word could be ?bla, bla, bla?.Nhenh?m (/??.???
?/) is a computationalprogram that decodes Brazilian?s official writingsystem into phonological symbols and marksprosody.
This program was used for translating,editing, grouping, and searching the work corpus.What inspired the software development, in2008, was the high level of transparency ofBrazilian Portuguese alphabetic system, althoughthere are some problems, namely the fact thesame grapheme ?e?
or ?o?
representsrespectively two different vowels, /e/, /?/ and /o/,/?/.
So, the hypothesis of the availability of thehigh level of predictability of that system guidedthe building of a software based on rules, whichautomatically converted graphemes intophonemes.Methodologically, the applicativedevelopment associates ComputationalLinguistics, Corpus Linguistics, Statistics,Phonology, and Phonetics.
Since the programplanning combined proper methodology andlinguistic theory, the software could be built in acomputer programming language which is notspecifically planned for the treatment of humanlanguage.The symbols Nhenh?m uses for theconversions are displayed in Tab.1.Graph Phon Example?

Grammatical ruleswere converted into algorithms and tested withinthe corpus.
A deep and exhaustive study of thegrammatical rules that govern the Portuguesewritten system preceded the design of the tool,consulting the literature on the subject.Internally, the program has all written Portuguesespelling rules (C?mara Jr., 1997, 1986, 1977;Scliar-Cabral, 2003a; Said Ali, 1964; Bechara,1973; Bisol, 1989; Cagliari, 2002) converted intoalgorithms, and also the entire Portugueseprosodic system, as it was created by Gon?alvesVianna in 1911, briefly adjusted in 1945 and in1973 (Bechara, 1973, Scliar-Cabral, 2003a).
Ifthe word stress is signaled graphically, theconverter reproduces it, if not, Nhenh?m appliesthe spelling rules presented in section 2.2.Nhenh?m bases the translation on aphonologic alphabet, which takes into accountthe International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA, 2012)fonts, but it gives responses in Arial Unicode MSfont (Tab.1).
There are no statistics associated tothe rules of grammar.
We are not worried by thefact that language has many rules: what reallymatters is that they are general, and that there arerules for the exceptions as well.
Unfortunately,some exceptions escape this principle, andbecame unpredictable, due to the lack of rules.As a result, they are responsible for about 5% orless of Nhenh?m translation inaccuracy.
We willdiscuss some of them later.The software reads relatively huge bunches ofdata, and bestow phonologic reports withstatistical reports.
Examining a phonologiccorpus rightly assembled, tests done by drawingon the applicative showed that it reaches no lessthan 98% of accuracy, reproducing the portion ofthe Brazilian writing system that is predictableby decoding rules.
In relation to the writtensystem as a hole, the correctness is not less than5595%.
It is known that, to implement the rules incertain groups, it is important to identify thesyllabic unit (Almeida & Sim?es, 2001; Candeias& Perdig?o, 2008), however, the first version ofNhenh?m (2008) reached at least 95% ofaccuracy without recognizing the syllabic unit.Such accuracy was measured by testing severaltexts with the program.
This means that, as soonas we approach this issue properly, the resultsshall become better.
Besides this performance,the program also reaches at least 99% ofprecision at signaling words stress.
Such resultsconfirm the hypotheses, and authenticate the highlevel of predictability of Brazilian alphabeticsystem, thanks to its phonological basis.
It alsocorroborates that the Brazilian alphabetic systemrepresents the prosody in a logical, accurate,economic and effective manner.The program does not fulfill some aspects oftranslating the written texts into phonologicaltranscription, but this happens because there aresome exceptions in the Portuguese writtensystem.
For instance, in some cases, the letter ?x?values are not all predictable by rules.
It can bedecoded as five different phonemes: /?
/, /s/, /z/,/k?S/, |S|.
For example: ?graxa?, ?sintaxe?,?exame?, ?nexo?, ?texto?
?
/?gra.
?a/, /s?.?ta.si/,/e.
?z?.mi/, /?n?.k?.su/, /?teS.tu/.
The first twoexamples represent the unpredictable cases.There are also some cases of ambiguity, forinstance, the letter ?s?
value after ?b?, e.g.:?observar?
(to observe) ?
/ob?seR?vaR/,?obs?quio?
(favor) ?
/ob??z?kiu/.
So, we considerthat ?s?
as representing an archiphoneme: /ob?Ser?vaR/ and /ob?
?S?kiu/ (Vasil?vski, 2010).Morphology can also provoke unpredictablesituations.
For example, the prefix ?trans-?,which means ?accross?, causes a pronunciationambiguity: ?transamaz?nica?
(trans+amaz?nica)is correctly decoded /tr?.za.ma.
?zo.ni.ka/, but?transiberiana?
(trans+siberiana) is decoded*/tr?.zi.be.ri.?
?.na/ instead of /tr?.si.be.ri.?
?.na/,because there is resyllabification.
How to instructa rules-based program that a rule can either beapplied or not for the same situation?This problem can only be solved byassociating morphologycal and phonologicalrules in the program.
We approached this issuedeeply in a previous work (Vasil?vski, 2008).For now, the solution is to edit the translated textso as to correct all these failures.Furthermore, the vowels [+low] /?/ and /?/ arewritten ?e?
and ?o?, as mentioned, which makesit hard to predict their values, since /o/ and /e/have the  same  coding.
When  they  are  stressedFigure 1: Main screen of the program Nhenh?m56and also signaled graphically, the conversion iscorrect.
The reduction of pre-tonic and pos-tonicvowels is also not properly addressed in theNhenh?m algorithm.Moreover, we decided to consider the socalled raising or crescent diphthong as hiatus(C?mara Jr. 1986; Bisol, 1989), therefore wordswith this ending are decoded  as  receiving  stresson  the  antepenultimate  syllable:  ??sseo?
?/ ?
?.si.u/, ?hist?ria?
?
/iS.
?
t?.ri.a/, ?n?usea?
?/?naw.zi.a/, ??cio?
?
/?
?.si.u/.In 2010, Nhenh?m was translated into anothercomputer language, and so we could improve itsperformance.
We incremented the mainalgorithm so that the system became capable ofproviding the phonological syllabic division, and,consequently, the spelling syllabic division, withat least 99% accuracy.
In this way it becameeasy to signal the stressed syllable, since its 2008version signaled only the stressed vowel.
Weused this renewed algorithm to make anautomatic syllable parsing for BrazilianPortuguese (Vasil?vski, 2010), and we had tosolve the problem of syllabication of words thatcontained hyphen, such as ?beija-flor?
(hummingbird), ?p?-de-moleque?
(a peanutcandy), ?dever-se-ia?
(verb to have a duty,conjugated for third person singular, Past FutureIndicative, synthetic passive voice, withmesoclisis), and solved them (Vasil?vski, 2011).In addition, we built an interface betweenNhenh?m and the software La?a-palavras(Vasil?vski & Ara?jo, 2010; Scliar-Cabral &Vasil?vski, 2011), which is used for linguisticresearch.
Furthermore, we used the Nhenh?mprosodic-phonological algorithm for building aprogram for speech therapy (Blasi & Vasil?vski,2011), consulting specific literature (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b).
This program has been testedand the results were encouraging (Garcez, Blasi,Vasil?vski, 2011).The text is converted while the user types it orpastes it.
Pasted texts must have simpleformatting, that is, no capital letters.
The stressedvowel is signaled by an order from the user.
Fig.1 shows the result for the text ?ameixas ame-asou deixe-as?.2 In the field Resultado (result), thetext entry appears converted into phonologicalsymbols.
The stressed syllable is signaled by theprosody mark before its first symbol.2Plums love them or leave them ?
a poem by PauloLeminski (1991).The Nhenh?m user can automatically converteither one word or a 20 pages text, edit it, save it,research it and print it.
As the system conversionis rightly esteemed on at least 95% of accuracy,it allows the user to edit the unsolved 5% (orless) failure rate text, converting, replacing andinserting symbols, adjusting to dialects.
Theprogram also allows several texts to be recordedin a database for specific use in statistical reports.3.3 Phonologic CorpusIn order to test Nhenh?m, and also to investigatephonologic patterns of Brazilian writtenPortuguese, we assembled a corpus with sixarticles, published in 2007 in a journal ofBrazilian dentistry.
They are technical andscientific texts, revised, and updated, which werenot produced to be used in linguistics research(Sinclair, 1991; Leech, 1992).The six texts were pre-edited in a text editor,individually, before pasting on Nhe-nh?m.Foreign words, words that contained graphemesthat do not belong to Portuguese written systemand measurement units were eliminated, as wellas some acronyms.
Some of them could bereplaced by its spelling form.
The systemexcludes punctuation, hyphen, quotation marks,and some other symbols by itself, so, they do notneed to be treated previously.In order to reduce chances of conversionerrors, care must be taken to ensure the texts?perfect readability by Nhenh?m.
After thispreparation, the corpus texts were pasted on theprogram, converted, printed, checked, edited, re-checked, and saved for research.
The exceptionswere searched and edited so as to obtain textcorrect translations.
The texts were loaded forgenerating statistical reports: the numbers, whichwill be now exposed, were generated and, assuch, are reliable.3.4 Statistical Report: The PhonologicPatternsThe corpus, after conversion, totalized 69,787phonemes, being distributed into 33,226 syllabicphonemes (vowels), 3,069 non-syllabicphonemes (semi-vowels), and 33,492 consonantphonemes.
Such numbers represent 47.61%,4.40%, and 47.99% respectively of the total.To confirm the results, we tested only one ofthe six texts belonging to the corpus (10,904phonemes), the numbers of which we present indetails (Fig.
2).
The main features (tra?os57principais) distribution is: 47.98% syllabicphonemes, 3.85% non-syllabic phonemes, and48.17% consonant phonemes.
The results arevery similar.In regard to the vowels (fonemas voc?licos),their distribution is: Tongue position: 42.09%front, 57.91% back; Tongue height: 44.29%high, 24.36% mid, 31.36% low; Airstream way(refers to the route taken by the air flow duringvocalization): 87.99% oral, 12.01% nasal; Liprounding: 30.31% rounded, 69.69% unrounded.The distribution of consonants is: Manner ofarticulation: 51.88% occlusive, and 48.12%constrictive, distributed as follows: 58.96%fricative, 31.02% vibrating, 10.01% lateral; Placeof articulation: 63.58% front, 16.70% back,19.73% labial; Airstream way: 90.73% oral,9.27% nasal (oral and nasal); Phonation: 48.95%unvoiced, 51.05% voiced ?

So, the resultsand also the numbers that show the phonologicpatterns of Brazilian Portuguese seem reliable.We tried to find another program or even studythat approaches this issue in a similar way, thatis, a one that determines the segments from theirfeatures and inform such statistics, using corpus,but we did not find any.
So, for awhile, we couldnot make comparisons in order to confirm thereliability of the numbers we have presented.A lot can be discussed about the results, butwe will make general comments here.
The backor posterior vowels occur around 15% plus thanthe front or minus posterior vowels.
Theposterior ones that appear most are /a/ and /u/,and, among the front, /i/, which occurs only 1%less than /a/.
So, the vowel that occurs most inPortuguese is /a/, closely followed by /i/.The semi-vowel / ??
?/ occurs only in the word?muito?
(many, much) ?
/'mu?.?
?tu/ and derivedforms.
The /?/ is computed with /i/, since the firstoccurs when in a word there is a sequence of twoconsonants which ordinarily are not a coda, andbelong to different syllable.
In this case, theepenthetic /?/ occurs while such sequence ispronounced.
So, this inserted phoneme works ascore of a phonological syllable: ?op??o?
(option),?cacto?
(cactus) ?
/o.p?.
's?w/, /ka.k?.tu/.In relation to the consonant phonemes, there isbalance in the occurrence of constrictive andocclusive, although occlusive always occuraround 3% more than the constrictive ones.From the results, we find that BrazilianPortuguese phonemic distribution is uniform,once the amount of vowels and consonants tendto be around 50% each.
Furthermore, it ispossible to deduce that CV (consonant+vowel) isthe most common syllable pattern of BrazilianPortuguese.
The semi-vowels reveal the amountof diphthongs (the real ones, that is, falling ordecrescent diphthongs), since the semi-vowelsonly occur in this case.We believe that a deeper analysis of thesenumbers can be very useful for Portugueselanguage research.3.5 The Spelling Agreement of 1991 (2009)Some changes are to occur in BrazilianPortuguese spelling, due to a spelling agreement,according to which at least seven of the countrieswhere Portuguese is spoken must use the samespelling, from 2013 on.The most important change for BrazilianPortuguese is the exclusion of the shudder(?trema?
), since recognizing diacrisis becomesunpredictable, e.g., the pronunciation of ?u?
ondigraphs ?g??
and ?q??.
Thus, ?ag?entar?
(tostand) and ?eq?ino?
(horse), until 2013 correctlydecoded as /agw?
?taR/ and /e?kwinu/, will bespelled ?aguentar?
and ?equino?, generating thetranslations */ag?
?taR/ and */e?kinu/.
In Brazil,shudder use is still very common.
For thesereason, Nhenh?m will preserve this resource inits algorithm.This means that the alphabetic system losestransparency, that is, loses one of the rules thatmake it predictable; therefore, reading(decoding) is impaired.
Other changes interfereless in the automatic translation, but none ofthem disturbs the prosody system.4 Conclusion and OutlooksThe experience of building, testing and usingNhenh?m has shown the degree of linguistictexts electronic reading and conversiondifficulty.
The phonemic level is the easiest tosystematize, the difficulty is greater for thesyllable level, the morphology level comes nextand then the syntax, which is more intricate.
Thecomplexity of each level may be attenuated bythe systematization of previous levels, becauseone takes advantage of the other systematization.So, converters like Nhenh?m are a step for futurework on levels that transcend the phoneme, likewe did to the syllable.Some decisions taken in the system buildingare objectionable to some and noteworthy toothers, as are some of theories chosen.
However,this was not optional.
The choices came from theneed imposed by the programming and, within59that, objectivity and intelligibility of existingtheories, and beliefs and intuition of teachers,students and other language users.
The efficiencyof Nhenh?m confirms the usefulness of thetheories adopted.Now that we have made the automaticsyllable parsing, the project follows.
We havebeen working at making the statistical report tolook directly to the syllable, and we believe theresults will be worthwhile.
Some of the nextsteps are to build a voice synthesizer fromNhenh?m, and improve Nhenh?m Fonoaud,which is the program for speech therapy.
Also,we are working on rules for reducing that 5% (orless) failure rate at the conversion.
Since theconversion tool successfully exploits the closecorrespondence between orthographicrepresentation and pronunciation in BrazilianPortuguese, it can prove to be useful in a range ofapplications, like in speech therapy.AcknowledgementsThis project is sponsored by CAPES, entity ofthe Brazilian government for the qualification ofhuman resources, which we thank.ReferencesAlmeida, Jos?
