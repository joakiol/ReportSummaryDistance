frGETA,  IMAG-campus  (U JF  & CNRS)BP 53, 38041 Grenoble  Codex 9, FranceAbstractWe propose a lexical organisation fi)r mullilinguallcxical databases (MLDB).
This organisation is based onacceptions (word-senses).
We detail this lexicalorganisation m~d show a mock-up built to experiment withit.
We also present our current work in defining andprototyping a specialised system for the manage,ncnt ofacception-based M LDB.Keywords: mnltilingual exical database, acccplion,linguistic structure.IntroductionNeeds for large scale lexical resources for NaturalLanguage Processing (NLP) in general and for MachineTranslation (MT) in p:uticular, increase very day.
Theseresources ,are considered to ::epresent the most expensivepart of ahnost any NLP system.
Ilcnce, an increasinginterest in the development of reusable dictionaries can beobserved.q'o develop a Multilingual Lexical Database (MLDB),we think of two main approaches.
First, the tran.~'rapproach where the links between the languages arerealized via unidirectional bilingual dictionaries.
Thisapproach is used by many MT systems and by somelexical database projects (notably Acquilex or Multilex).Second, the interlingttal approach where the linksbetween the languages arc realized via an nniqueinterlingual dictionary.
The KBMT-89 project(Knowledge Based Machine Translation) at CarnegieMellon University in the US and the EI)R. (ElectronicDictionary Research) project in Japan use tiffs approach.In the context of multilingnal MT systems, we arcinterested in the problems posed when constructing "rodusing an application and theory independent MLDB.
Wcare developing a Lexical l)atabase Management SyslcIn,NADIA, based on an inlerlingual approach.
Wc choseacceptions as inlerlingual milts.
NADIA provides re:mytools for the management of MLI)Bs.
Moreover, thissystem gives the linguist a great liberty in tbc choice of thelinguistic structures.We first give ,an overview of the project, beginning withits lexical organization.
Then, we give the results of ourexperimentations on this lexic,'d organization.
Finaly, wepresent our current work: the definition and prolotyping ofa specialized system for the management of acception-based MLDBs.NADIA is the continuation of a work done for theMultilex ESPRIT project.
The coherence checkcr andsoftware architecture have been defined for Multilex andadapted to our lexical orga,fizatinn.I.
Accept ion-basod lexical organizationAfter studying and comparing different projecls oflexic:d dat;dmses, including I"J)R (E\[31~.
1993), KBMT-89(Nirenburg and 1)cfrise 1990; Good,nan and Nirenburg1991) Multilex and of Mullilingual MT syslems, such asCICC (Uchida and Zhu 1991) and ULTRA (Farwcll,,guthrie ctal.
1992), wc lmve concluded in favor of aniutcrlingual lexical organization for our MLDBs.Some of the inter,rational projects of lexical databasesare based on a multbbilingual approach (e.g.
Multilex)while others use knowledge representation as aninterlingua (e.g.
KBMT-89 or EI)P,).
Much like ULTRA,our approach is interlingual and linguislic rather thanknowledge-based.1.
The dictionariesA MLI)B consists of two kinds of diclionarics: lhcmonolingual dictionaries and the acception dictionary.1,1, Mono l i~  dielionaricsThe monolingual dictionaries arc accessible by entries.These entries are le,mnas ("normal form" of words, e.g.
inSnglish, infinilivc lk~r verbs, singt, lar for nouns, etc.
).Items of the monolingual dictionaries (monolingualacceptions) are generally accepted meanings of words orexpressions, as wc can find them in standard printeddictiona,'ics.
These monolingnal acccplions arc combinedwith their linguistic inlbrnmtion.Monolingual acceptious of a language L arc acccptionsthat are connected to a word or an expression of L. Suchan acccption can be accessed from one (or mo,'e) entries.1.2, Ace.option dicdonm2~The interlingual diclio,mry, called acc(v~tion ?lictionaty,contains interlingual acctT)timzs.
Some inlkwnnalion c\[in belinked to these intcrlingu:fl acceptions.In a MLI)B composed of n monolingual dictiouaries, theset of intcrlingual acccplions is equal Io the uuinn of thesets of monolingual acceptions of the n dictionaries, withan equality relation bound to the semantic identity.Some contrastivc problems may appear when twomonolingual acceptious of two different languages aresemantically slightly different.
This appears when there isa non-direct ranslation of a word (e.g.
'river' can betranslated in French by 'rivibre' or by Tleuvc 'l ).
This kindof problem is solved by a relation from acceplion to sub-acception which is prc-defincd in all NADIA lcxicaldatabases: the contrastivc relation.
It is intended to codecontras|ive problems induced by a non-direct translation, it1 A 'rivibre' is a ralher small river fl(~wlng into annlher iver.
A 'fleuve'is a large river flowing into the ,see.278/ '7"'\  / .......

I,exical organizati(mIn the acception-based lexical organization, themonolingual acceptions and the interlingual acccplionsmust satisfy the lbllowing criteria:2,1.
Well-formcdness crileria, Each interIingual acctTtion correspomls to at &astone monoIingual acception.
This criterion slatesthat an interlingual acccption must correspond to atleast one entry of one language (as ntonolingualacceptions).?
An interliagual acception corresponds to at mostone monolingual acception of the same language.An interlingual aeception is not necess'~rilyconnected to a mcmolingual acccption of eachlanguage of the MLDB.?
A monolingual acception corresponds to one andonly one interlingual acceptiom A monolingualacception is always related to an intcrliugualacception and (as stated by the preceding criterion)is one-one.2.2.
Translation criteria?
Two monolingual cceptions ofdiffi~rent languagescorrespond to a unique interlingual acception if,and only if they have the same meaning.
Thiscriterion sta~es the semantic identity of twomonolingttal acceplions of  different langtmgcs(provided that they correspond to the sameinterlingual acception) allowing the use of theinterlingual dictionary for lexieal translationpurposes.?
If entry el of language TA is translated by entry e2in language L2 via a non-dh'ect equivalence, thecorresponding interlingual acception must be linkedby the conm~stive r lation or by a relalion of quasi-synonymy.
This criterion allows the use of theacception dictionary for lexical translalion purposeseven when there is no direct translation.I I .
Experimentationl .
The  Parax  mock-upIn order to experiment this lexical organizatio,t, 1;:.
Blanchas built the Parax mock-up (Sdrasset and Blanc 1993).This mock-np is a small acceplion-based lexical databaseof 5 languages (Fmglish, French, German, I~.ttssian,Chinese).Parax, produced on Macinlosh with IlypcrCard TM, wasdesigned to experiment prol~letns inherent to theacception-based lexieal organization, llence, items of themonoliugual diclionaries are combined with rather simplelinguistic information.An enlry of a monolingual dictiotmry is linked Io severalacceplions.
These acceptions arc provided with theirlinguistic information (lcfl c(flumn in fig.

l:.ach of thesemonolingual acceptions is related to an interlingualacccption along with its (lefinition (in French) and s0mescmanlic infonnation (right eoltnnn in fig.

Then, we can get'>getlrrrrr,?>l ' for fl man or '3aMyx'-: ', 'aaMym (gblflTI| - as)'or ~3,t~MyIK(~M '* for  a woman.2.
Indexing methodology2.1.
Indexing in ParaxAs the platform we used for this mock-up was notspecialized for such a task, we have used an indexingmethodology lbr the construction of this MLI)B.The starting point of onr work was a smaU French corpuswe wanted to index, llence, we begau to index Frenchwords and for each created acceptions, we gave atranslation i  the other languages.After creating an entry, the lexicographer gives itsdifferent word-senses ,and their linked linguistic informa-tion (the kind of information depends on the language ofthe entry).Then, the lexicographer links the word senses to aninterlingual cception.
As lhe number of acceplions i  stillsmall, it is possible to select an ,already existing aeceptionby browsing directly in the acception dictionary.
If thesearched aceeption does not exist, it is created along with adefinition in French and some semantic inlk)rmation.2.2.
General c, ~'ls.~When developing a lmge scale MLI)B, it is no longerpossible to select existing interlingual acceptions bydirectly browsing through the acceptiou dictionary.Moreover, the different dictionaries will have to beiudexed by different lexicographers.
11encc, it is necessaryto define another methodology.The process of creation of an entry and its monolingualacceptions does not change.
AftEr creating an enlry, Ihelexicographer selects a possible translation for theconsidered acception in a language of the database.
If thistranslation is already indexed in the target language, heselects the corresponding acception in the targetdictionary.
The source and target monolingual aeceptionsare automatically linked to the same inlerlingualacception.
If the translation is not ah'eady indexed in thetarget language, the lexicographer indexes it (partially)and asks the person in charge of the target dictionary tocomplete the new entry.The acception dictionary is thus constructed andmanaged by the system and the lexicographers work inmore or less the s,-une way as when indexing bilingualdictionaries.
This automatic management of theinterlingual dictionary involves the automatic verificationof the criteria defined abxwe.When a problem is detected the system attaches aw,-u-ning for the lexicographer in charge of the acceptiondictionary, m~d proposes adefault solution.3.
Some resultsThe corpus we wanted to index in the Parax mock-upconsisted of 135 entries in French corresponding to arepresentative s t of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbsof gener:d vocabulary.
We have indexed these entries andthe related aeceptions.
As we sutrted the indexation with qFrench corlms, only some of the entries in the otherlanguages have been given all their acceptions.The distribution of the entries and aeceplions of thedifferent languages i the lollowiag:l~ntries Acccptions\[ Frencl~ 135 484~ 304 484l German 388 509\ [ ~ m  394 545This represents a total of 589 interlingual acccptions.Among these intcrlingual aeceptions, 58 are sub-acceptious introduced by contr,'t~tive problen~s.
The size ofthis mock-up is of the same order as that of Multilcx.III.
Current workOur current work consists in the dcfiniti(m andprototyping of a specialized management system foracceplion based MLI)FIs.1.
Related projeclsSome internalional projects have already started thedevelopment of a system for MLl)lis.
We have studiedand we nse some of  their reStllis.In Fmropc, we have participated in the Mullilcx project(CFC - I)G XIII - EsPRrI" project) which aims at thedefinition of standards for lexieal databases systems.
Weuse some o1' its rcstzlts (e.g.
the software architecture, someof the tools).Multilex's software architecture, based on three layers(presentation level, internal level and database level),clearly separates the presentation from the coding and thecoding from the storage of the information.
Thisorganization allows to change Ihe presentation of thestructures (giving the possibility to define user interfaceshiding the internal structure).We have also studied the Jap:mesc I:I)R project whichhas developed large dictionaries of about 300,000 words inbofll English and Japanese (200,000 of general vocalml:u-y,100,000 of terminological vocabulary).
FDR has alsodeveloped iction:uies of 4(X),000 concepts, dictionaries of300,000 co-occun'cnces (bolh in F.nglish and Japanese)and dictionaries of 300,000 bilingual culries (both forJ,'qmucsc-l:.nglish and l';nglish-Japauesc) (I';I)R 1993).In EDIt., illdividtml concepts arc introduced in the worddictionary and correspond to the word senses, llence, ouracceptions are really close 1o their concepts, l lowever,they do not use a contrastivc relation t() code problemsbetween the languages.The CICC (Center of International Cooperation forComputerization, Japan) has also used a very closeorganization to construct a MLI)B (Japanese, Chincse,Thai, Malay, and Indonesian) for its Multilingu:d MachineTranslation system.
This lexical database coulains 50,000wonls or terms (Uchida and Zhu 1991).2.
Toward a specialized management systemA specialized management system for acception-basedlexical databases must offer ways to automatisc themanagement of the aceeption dictionary.
It must also offertools to define, index and manage the monolingualdictionaries.280The NAI)IA system has to detect potential errHrs in theacceptiHn database.
Fach pHtenlial Error is giVEn IH alexicographer who is in charge of the correctio,.
Thisdetection is independent of the linguistic structure of themonolingual dictkmary.
It consists in tile detection ofgeHmclrie inconsistencies in the relations between theelements Hf the database (entries, nlonolingtlal acceptions,inleflingtull acceplions).
"llm NAI)IA system also provides tHOIS to help the usersdefine, index, and manage aMI,I)B.These tHHIS depend on the linguistic slructure Hf Ihedifferent dictionaries, Ilence, a lingnist has to declare theslructure of the mlicles of the dictkmaries via a specializedla,tguage.
To encode the linguistic informatkm, thelinguist can use p,'edefined basic data structures (strings.lists, sets, trues, graphs, autHmata or Typed FeatureS It'llcttll'eS).Several tools have been defined to help tlm users:.
l,',ditor: lhis tool provides a default interface to edititems Hf a dictionary.
It is alSH ixmsible to customizethe interface - -  this tHol is at sh'uctured Edilor h laGRIF (Andr6, Furttla et ill. 1989).Browser: this tool gives ways to browse through Ihedatabase.?
Colterence checker: the linguist may defi,e somecoherence all(l integrity rules that apply on an article,on a dictionary Hr on the whole lexical database.These rules are checked alld file result lfepet~ds onthe strength of the nile.l ) iq'aulter: the linguist may also define rules IHdefault entries HI a dictionary.
These rules can beapplied in batch mode (in order to expand an existingdictionmy) Hr in interactive mode (to hel l} thelexicographer in the indexing proCESS).?
lnq)ort/eaport: the linguist m:ty write importing andexporting prHcedures from the intermtl structure to anexternal Rmnat based on the SGMI, langLUlgc andTEl guidelines.3.
I)cfinit ion of the lixngtnistic s l ructures anticohe,'ence checkingAs an example of the use tlf tile NA1)IA matmgenlcntsystem for acceptiHn-based MI,I)B, WE give the definitionof the linguistic struclu,'e used ixl Ihe Parax mock-.up (sueabove).
Then, we give sonic constraints that can bedefined on this database.3,1, l)?\[htition of l , ing!
!
i~ '~ I~I,S~The linguistic structttre used in Pa,ax is inspired by thestructures of the dictionaries of GI'TI'A's ARiANE system.It is at flat list Hf attrilmte-value pairs.3.1.1.
An example: l'arax "I)I.S"We give here a LISP form Hf the defixfition of theslructures.
Oflter dialects will be defined in order to hidelhis LISP Rmn to the linguist (see below).lAJinition of the databaseBefHre defining the structures of :t dictionary, thelinguist has to define lhe database.
This definition consistsHf a dechtratiHn of the diction:wies cHmainEd in il (hErE, adatabase called "Parax" with 4 monHlingual diclionaries).FHr each dictionary, the li.guist cnlcrs its namE, itslanguage, its owner, all optional comment and tile classesused to CH(Io its Entries and acccptiHns.

This task isanalogous to the definition Hf classes ill all 0bieCl-Hricntedhlngttage, or to the clEf trillion of tile structttrE of astructarcd Hcumcnt (h Ill GRIF, l ,aTEX or FranleMaker).Two "classes" are ah'eady dcfixled by the system: enlry"rod accEption, The linguist determines the structures to heassociated with these HbiECtS, l lerc, we give the dcfinilionof the structure of the French diclkmary.The predefined class entry implemEnls a tree withaccEptions on ils leaves.
In the following example, anEntry consists in a feature structure with two fcalures (agraphic-lbmi and \[i categHry).

Coherence checkinffWhen the definition of the structure is done, the linguistcan define coherence rules that will be applied on theentries.3.2.1.
Three kinds of ruleThe linguist cml define three kind of rules:?
I n tegr i ty  rules apply to an article of a dictionary.They ensure that none of the ,article of the lexicaldatabase has an ill-funned configuration.?
Loca l  coherence rules apply to different articlcs ofthe stone dictionary.
They ensure that the dictionaryis coherent.?
G loba l  coherence  rules applyto different articles ofdifferent dictionaries of tile lexical database.
TheyellSUl'e some coherence between dictiouaries.3.2.2.
Three levels or cohere,ce rules"llle rules are ,associated wilh a strength:?
Warning:  when the constraint is overridden, amessage is passed to tile lexicographer, but alltreatments ,arc ,allowed.
The warning disappears assoon as lhe lexicographer validates tile entry.
Theseconstraints are nsed Io detect potential emirs.?
Delay: when the eonsmtint is overridden, tilelexicographer eceives a mess:,ge and sonictreatments are forbidden on tile concerned entries.Incorrect entries will not be accessible by extractionrequests.
Interactive treatments such as browsing andediting are allowed.
These constraints are used tohandle temporarily incomplete ntries.?
C r i t i cah  these constraints can't be overridden.
If atransaction overrides such a constraint, it will becmlccled (rollback).3.2.3.
Exmnple of coherence rule declarathmA coherence rule declaration is a method (ill the sense ofI .
ISP /Common Lisp Object System) which is applied onall objects of the class defined in tile parameter lisl.
Thebody of tile rule is a lisp expression that must t'CltJrn T ornil.
If the result is nil, the exception nmchanismcorresponding to tim strength of tile rule is inw~kcd.Ilere is an example of an integrity rule for the Frenchdictionary.
This rule verifies that the derivationinformation is coherent with the category of tile aceeption.

First, theacception-based lexical organization seems to offer theadvantages of an interlingual approach while avoidingsome of the theoretical and methodological problems ofthe kuowledge-bascd approach (Sdrasset and Blanc 1993).Second, it gives the linguist he possibility to freely dciinea collection of linguistic structures with a raflmr completeset of predefined ata structures.Our objective now is to integrate in this prototypefeatures coming from research in the field of structureddocuments and a multidialectal facility ill all tools, illorder to provide lexicographers and other users with aninterface iu their mother tongue.AcknowledgmentsA part of this work was conducted ill tile Multilexproject.
