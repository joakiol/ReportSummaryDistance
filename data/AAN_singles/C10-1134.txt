pose a challenging task onsentiment analysis.
This paper proposes aknowledge-based method toautomatically determine the semanticorientation of DSAAs within context.The task is reduced to sentimentclassification of target nouns, which werefer to sentiment expectation instead ofsemantic orientation widely used inprevious researches.
We mine the Webusing lexico-syntactic patterns to infersentiment expectation of nouns, and thenexploit character-sentiment model toreduce noises caused by the Web data.At sentence level, our method achievespromising result with an f-score of78.52% that is substantially better thanbaselines.
At document level, ourmethod outperforms previous work insentiment classification of productreviews.1 IntroductionIn recent years, sentiment analysis has attractedconsiderable attention in the NLP community.
Itis the task of mining positive and negativeopinions from natural language, which can beapplied to many research fields.
Previous workon this problem falls into three groups: opinionmining of documents, sentiment classification ofsentences and polarity prediction of words.Sentiment analysis both at document andsentence level rely heavily on word level.The most frequently explored task at the wordlevel is to determine the polarity of words, inwhich most work centers on assigning a priorpolarity to words or word senses in the lexiconout of context.
However, for some words, thepolarity varies strongly with context, making ithard to attach each to a fixed sentiment categoryin the lexicon.
For example, the word ?low?hasa positive orientation in ?low cost?
but anegative orientation in ?low salary?.
We callthese words like ?low?
dynamic sentimentambiguous adjectives (DSAAs).
Turney andLittman (2003) claim that DSAAs cannot beavoided in a real-world application.
Butunfortunately, DSAAs are discarded by mostresearch concerning sentiment analysis.In this paper, we are devoted to thechallenging task of disambiguating DSAAs.
Thetask is to automatically determine the semanticorientation (SO) of DSAAs within context.
Welimit our work to 14 frequently used adjectivesin Chinese, such as ?large, small, many, few,high, low?, which all have the meaning ofmeasurement.
Although the number of suchambiguous adjectives is not large, they arefrequently used in real text, especially in thetexts expressing opinions and emotions.
Asdemonstrated by the experimental results in thispaper, the disambiguation of 14 DSAAs canobviously improve the performance of sentimentclassification of product reviews.The task of disambiguating DSAAs is reducedto sentiment classification of nouns.
Previousstudies classify nouns into three categories:positive, negative and neutral.
In contrast, wepropose two categories of sentiment expectation1191of nouns: positive expectation and negativeexpectation.
This paper presents a novelapproach to automatically predict sentimentexpectation of nouns.
First, we infer thesentiment expectation of a noun by mining theWeb with strongly-polar-steering lexico-syntactic patterns.
Secondly, we derive thesentiment expectation of a noun from itscomponent characters, which capture thesemantic relationship between Chinese wordsand characters.
Finally, a better performance isobtained by combing the two methods.
Weconduct two types of experiments: theexperimental results at the sentence levelvalidate the effectiveness of our approach; theexperimental results at the document levelconfirm the significance of the problem weaddressed.2 Related Work2.1 Word-level Sentiment AnalysisRecently there has been extensive research insentiment analysis, for which Pang and Lee(2008) give an in-depth survey of literature.Closer to our study is the large body of work onautomatic SO prediction of words(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turneyand Littman, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004;Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006), butunfortunately they all discard DSAAs in theirresearch.
In recent years, some studies go a stepfurther, attaching SO to senses instead of wordforms (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Wiebe andMihalcea, 2006; Su and Markert 2008), but theirwork is still limited in lexicon out of context.The most relevant work is Ding et al (2008),in which DSAAs are named as contextdependant opinions.
They argue that there is noway to know the SO of DSAAs without priorknowledge, and asking a domain expert toprovider such knowledge is scalable.
They adopta holistic lexicon-based approach to solve thisproblem, which exploits external informationand evidences in other sentences and otherreviews.
On the contrary in this paper, we obtainthe prior knowledge of a product by mining theweb, and then use such knowledge to determinethe SO of DSAAs.
The prior knowledge of aproduct, which is closer to the sentimentexpectation of nouns described in this paper, isan important research issue in itself and hasmany applications in sentiment analysis, asdiscussed in section 3.2.2.2 Phrase-level Sentiment AnalysisThe disambiguation of DSAAs can also beconsidered as a problem of phrase-levelsentiment analysis.
Wilson et al (2004) present atwo-step process to recognize contextual polaritythat employs machine learning and a variety offeatures.
Takamura et al (2006, 2007) proposelatent variable model and lexical network todetermine SO of phrases, focusing on?noun+adjective?
pairs.
Their experimentalresults suggest that the classification of pairscontaining ambiguous adjectives is much harderthan those with unambiguous adjectives.
Theabove mentioned approaches are all supervised,and need human labeled data for training.
Incontrast, our method is unsupervised and canovercome the data acquisition bottleneck.Moreover, we focus on the much harder task ofdisambiguating DSAAs in ?noun+adjective?pairs.2.3 Pattern-based MethodPrevious studies have applied pattern-basedmethod to sentiment analysis (Riloff and Wiebe,2003; Wiebe et al, 2004; Riloff et al, 2005;Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Andreevskaia andBerger; 2006).
The differences with our methodlie in two aspects: the used resources (corpusversus web) and the research target (subjectiveexpressions versus sentiment expectation).2.4 Character-based MethodChinese characters carry semantic informationthat is indicative of semantic properties of words.Previous studies have exploited the character-based model to predict the semantic categoriesof Chinese unknown words (Chen, 2004; Lu,2007).
Yuen et al (2004) presents a method toinfer the SO of a Chinese word from itsstatistical association with strong-polarizedcharacters rather than with strong-polarizedwords.
The work by Ku et al (2006) is similar toours because they also define the sentiment scoreof a word by its composite characters.
However,their algorithm is based only on frequency, whilewe exploit point mutual information that cancapture the character-sentiment association.11923 Determining SO of Adjective byTarget Noun3.1 Classification of DSAAsThe frequently used DSAAs are given below.We group them into two categories: positive-likeadjectives and negative-like adjectives.
Theseadjectives are neutral out of context, but positiveor negative emotion will be evoked when theyco-occur with some target nouns, making it hardto assign each to a fixed sentiment category inlexicon.
(1) Positive-like adjectives (Pa) = {?
da|large,?
duo|many,?
gao|high,?
hou|thick,?shen|deep,?
zhong|heavy,??
ju-da|huge,??
zhong-da|great}(2) Negative-like adjectives (Na) ={?xiao|small,?
shao |few, ?
di|low, ?
bao|thin,?
qian|shallow, ?
qing|light}3.2 Sentiment Expectation of NounThe SO of most DSAAs can be determined bytarget nouns in noun-adjective phrases, as shownin Table 1.
For example, the word ?high?has apositive orientation when the target noun is?salary?
but a negative orientation when thetarget noun is ?price?.
Therefore, the task can bereduced to sentiment classification of nouns.Positive?
?
?
|potential is great??
?|salary is highNegative?
?
?
|potential is small???
|salary is lowNegative?
?
?
|pressure is big??
?|price is highPositive?
?
?
|pressure is small??
?
|price is lowTable 1: The SO of DSAAs in noun-adjective phrasesIn previous research, the SO of nouns isclassified into three categories: positive,negative and neutral.
Accordingly, ???
ya-li|pressure?will be assigned as negative and ???
qian-li|potential?
as positive, while ???gong-zi|salary?
and ???
jia-ge|price?
will beassigned as neutral, as the two terms areobjective and cannot evoke positive or negativeemotion.
Different from the traditionalclassification scheme, we propose sentimentexpectation and classify nouns into twocategories: positive expectation and negativeexpectation.
For a positive expectation noun,people usually expect the thing referred to by thenoun to be bigger, higher or happen frequently.On the contrary, for a negative expectation noun,people usually expect the thing referred to by thenoun to be smaller, lower or don?t happen .
Forexample, ??
?
jia-ge|price?
is a negativeexpectation noun, as most people in most casesexpect that the product prices become low,whereas ???
gong-zi|salary?
is a positiveexpectation noun, as most people in most casesexpect that their salaries become high.
Therelationship between traditional SO andsentiment expectation can be defined as: positive(negative) terms correspond to positive (negative)expectation terms, but some neutral terms mayalso carry positive (negative) expectation.Su and Markert (2008) argue that polarity canalso be attached to objective words.
Thedifference with our scheme is that, for example,??
?
jia-ge|price?
is attached to negativeexpectation in our scheme while is still neutral inSu and Markert?s method.The distinction between positive and negativeexpectation nouns is vital to determine the SO ofsome phrases.
Using it to disambiguate DSAAsis a good example.
Another application is thephrase containing verbs with the meaning ofstatus change.
For example, ?????
?|salaryhas been raised?
will evoke positive emotion,while ??????
jiage-shangzhang-le|priceshave gone up?will evoke negative emotion.
Asfar as we are aware, this is the first sentimentanalysis scheme that tries to exploit people?sexpectation towards nouns.3.3 Determination of DSAAsThe SO of DSAAs in a given phrase can becalculated by Eq.
(1).1 if a is positive-likeC(a) =-1 if a is negative-like??
?1 if n is positive expectationC(n) =-1 if n is negative expectation??
?SO(a)=C(a)*C(n)If adverb=??
bu|not?, SO(a)= -SO(a)Where C(a) denotes the category of DSAAs; C(n)denotes the sentiment expectation of nouns;SO(a) is the SO of DSAAs in a give noun-adjective phrase.
When the adverb is thenegation term ??
bu|not?, the SO is reversed.
(1)11934 Predicting Sentiment Expectation ofNoun4.1 Pattern-based Prediction Using a WebSearch EngineIn natural language, there are some lexico-syntactic patterns that people frequently usewhen they express their opinion about something.For example:(3) ?
??
?
?
| Salary is a little low.
(4) ?
?
?
?
?| Price is a little high.The pattern ?<n> ??
<a>?
carries a strongnegative association in Chinese language.
Whena man is saying ?????
?| Salary is a littlelow?, it indicates that he wishes his ???|salary?
to be raised.
On the contrary, when aman is saying ??????
| price is a littlehigh?, it indicates that he wishes ???
|price?to go down.
As a result, ???
|salary?
haspositive expectation while ???
|price?
hasnegative expectation.With the rapid development and expansion ofthe internet, Web has become an importantmedium for people to post their ideas.
Theopinions expressed on the Web reflect thecommon cognition shared by collection ofpeople in a culture.
Therefore, using a Websearch engine with the strong-polar-steeringlexico-syntactic patterns as queries, we can inferthe sentiment expectation of a noun, bycalculating its statistical association withpositive and negative hits.As an example, using the search engineBaidu 2 with the pattern ?<n> ??
<a>?
asqueries, we obtain the following hits:(5) ?
??
?
?
| Salary is a little low.
(2890 hits)?
??
?
?
| Salary is a little high (67 hits)(6) ?
?
?
?
?
| Price is a little high.
(19400 hits)?
?
?
?
?
| Price is a little low.
(1080 hits)The more than 40 times more numerous hits for??????
|Salary is a little low?indicate thatthat ??
?|salary?is a positive expectation noun.For the same reason, we can infer that ??
?|price?has negative expectation.DSAAs are classified into two opposite setsPa and Na, as listed in (1) and (2) respectively.2 http://baidu.com.cn.Here two-character adjectives (???
|huge?and???
|great?)
are discarded.
Four types oflexico-syntactic patterns, which are alsoclassified into two opposite sets in consistentwith Pa and Na, are used in this paper, as listedin Table 2.
These patterns were manuallydesigned, inspired by linguistic knowledge andafter a deep investigation on the Web.Pos.

For each noun, we obtain thehits of both positive and negative expectationpatterns, using the search engine Baidu.

Most words (9 out of 10)are correctly predicted, demonstrating that theresult of pattern-based method is promising.
Theonly wrong predicted noun is ???

An alternate way is to exploit the semanticknowledge of Chinese characters.
It is assumedthat there is a strong association between thesentiment category of a word and its componentcharacters.
For example, the three words ??
?zui?e|evil, ?
?
zuixing|crime, ?
?zuiguo|fault?, which all contain the character ??zui|sin?
that carries negative meaning, are allnegative expectation nouns.First, we compute the character-wordsentiment association by the following PMIformula, based on a sentiment lexicon:( , ), log( ) ( )P c PositivePMI c PositiveP c P Positive?
?=( , ), log( ) ( )P c NegativePMI c NegativeP c P Negative?
?=( ) ( , ) ( , )SO c PMI c Positive PMI c Negative?
?Where ( , )P c Positive is the probability of acharacter c in the positive category; ( )P c is theprobability of a character c in the sentimentlexicon; ( )P Positive is the probability of thepositive category in the sentiment lexicon.,PMI c Negative?
?
has the similar meaning.Probabilities are estimated according to themaximum likelihood principle.The open language resources for Chinesesentiment analysis are quite limited.
We selectedthe following two sentiment lexicons.Sentiment HowNet.
HowNet has publishedthe Chinese vocabulary for sentiment analysis3,3 http://www.keenage.com/html/c_index.html.which was manually constructed.
The positivecategory contains 4,566 words and the negativecategory contains 4,370 words.Sentiment BaiduHit.
In our collected data,we extracted 9,468 nouns.
Using the pattern-based method we acquired sentiment expectationof these nouns, where 2,530 ones were assignedas positive expectation, 1,837 ones as negativeexpectation and 5,101 ones were not predicted.
Itis assumed that most nouns are correctlypredicted.
These nouns with their sentimentexpectation constitute the lexicon of SentimentBaiduHit, which is automatically constructed.Combining HowNet and BaiduHit.
Mostsentiment characters derived from HowNet haveadjective property, since most words inSentiment HowNet are adjectives.
On thecontrary, most sentiment characters derived fromBaiduHit have noun property.
Therefore, thecombination of the two lexicons can cover morecharacters.
As Sentiment HowNet is manuallycompiled, the sentiment characters derived fromit should be more reasonable than those fromBaiduHit.
When combining the two lexicons incomputing character polarity, we assign a highpriority to HowNet.
Only when a character is outof vocabulary in HowNet, we resort to BaiduHit.Then, we acquire the sentiment category of aword by computing the following equation.
Let aword consist of n characters 1 2, nw c c c?
?...
,the sentiment category of the word is calculatedby the average sentiment value of its componentcharacters:11_ ( ) ( )niiCH SO w SO cn ??

(6)We acquired sentiment expectation of 9,468nouns in our collected data, based on SentimentHowNet, Sentiment BaiduHit, and thecombination of the two lexicons, respectively.Table 6 gives examples of nouns withsentiment expectation acquired by the character-based method combining the two lexicons ofHowNet and BaiduHit, descending (the leftcolumn) and ascending (the right column) by theabsolute value of _ ( )CH SO w .

The pattern-basedmethod concentrates on a word?s usage on theWeb, whereas the character-based methodfocuses on the internal structure of a word.
Sothe two methods can be integrated to get betterperformance.
The results using pattern-basedmethod are much better than character-basedmethod, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4.
Soin the integrated scheme, we give a high priorityto pattern-based method.
The pattern-basedapproach is mainly used, and only when thevalue of | _ ( ) |PT SO n is smaller than a thresholdr, the character-based method is adopted.Because when the value of | _ ( ) |PT SO n is verysmall, it could be caused by random noises onthe Web.
We set r to 9 according to empiricalanalysis in the development data.5 Experiments5.1 Sentiment Analysis at Sentence Level5.1.1 DataWe collected data from two sources.
The mainpart was extracted from Xinhua News Agency ofChinese Gigaword (Second Edition) released byLDC.
The texts were automatically word-segmented and POS-tagged using the opensoftware ICTCLAS4.
In order to concentrate onthe disambiguation of DSAAs, and reduce thenoise introduced by the parser, we extractedsentences containing strings in pattern of (7),where the target noun is modified by theadjective in most cases.4 http://www.ictclas.org/.
(7) noun+adverb+adjective (adjective?DSAAs)e.g.
?
?/n ?/d ?/a | the cost is low.Another small part of data was extracted fromthe Web.
Using the search engine Google5, wesearched the queries as in (8):(8) ?
| very+ adjective (adjective?DSAAs )From the returned snippets, we manually pickedout some sentences that contain the strings of (7).Also, the sentences were automatically word-segmented and POS-tagged using ICTCLAS.DSAAs in the data were assigned as positive,negative or neutral, independently by twoannotators.
Since we focus on the distinctionbetween positive and negative categories, theneutral instances were removed.
Table 5 givesstatistics of the data, and the inter-annotatoragreement is in a high level with a kappa of 0.91.After cases with disagreement were negotiatedbetween the two annotators, a gold standardannotation was agreed upon.
In this paper, 3066instances were divided randomly into three parts,1/3 of which were used as the development data,and 2/3 were the test data.Most of the data has been used as thebenchmark dataset of SemEval-2010 task 18?disambiguating sentiment ambiguousadjectives?
(Wu and Jin, 2010), and so it can bedownloaded freely for research.Table 5: The statistics of DSAAs data5.1.2 BaselineWe conducted two types of baseline.Simple Baseline.
Not considering the context,assign all positive-like adjectives as positive, andall negative-like adjectives as negative.HowNet Baseline.

The pattern-based method, asstraightforward as it is, achieves promising resultwith an f-score of 73.69%, which is 12.49%higher than the simple baseline.
The pattern-based method outperforms the character-basedmethod (combined) by 4.82% in precision and0.73% in recall.
The performance of thecharacter-based method based on SentimentBaiduHit is competitive with that based onSentiment HowNet, which again proves theeffectiveness of the pattern-based method.
Thecharacter-based method combining the twolexicons outperforms each lexicon with smallimprovement.
The approach integrating pattern-based and character-based methods outperformseach method in isolation, achieving an f-score of78.52% that is 17.32% higher than the simplebaseline and 60.58% higher than HowNetbaseline.5.2 Sentiment Analysis at Document Level5.2.1 DataWe also investigated the impact ofdisambiguating DSAAs on the sentimentclassification of product reviews.
Following thework of Wan (2008), we selected the samedataset.
The dataset contains 886 Chineseproduct reviews, which are manually annotatedwith polarity labels: positive or negative.
Also,the files are automatically word-segmented andPOS-tagged using ICTCLAS.
We extracted thefiles that contain the following strings, where thenouns are modified by DSAAs in most cases.
(9) noun+adjective (adjective?DSAAs)noun+adverb+adjectivenoun+adverb+adverb+adjective.We obtained 212 files, up to 24% of the overalldata, suggesting again that DSAAs arefrequently used in product reviews and cannot beavoided in a real-world application.5.2.2 MethodsOur goal is not to propose a new method, butinstead to test the performance gain by addingthe disambiguation of DSAAs.
We adopted thesame algorithm with Wan (2008), and also usedSentiment-HowNet.
But in our experiment,Negation_Dic contains only one term ?
?bu|not?, for the sake of repeatable experiments.The baseline algorithm is illustrated by thenon-italic part in Figure 1, where we set thesame parameters with Wan?s approach:PosValue=1, NegValue=-2, q=2, ?=2.We added the disambiguation of DSAAs tothe algorithm, as illustrated by the italic part inFigure 1.
When a word is a DSAA, compute itsSO with the proposed integrated method, ratherthan using its prior polarity specified in HowNet.For Dy_PosValue and Dy_NegValue, we first setDy_PosValue=1 and Dy_NegValue=-2, just thesame as PosValue and NegValue.
In the secondattempt, in order to further intensify the polarityof DSAAs, we set Dy_PosValue=1.5 andDy_NegValue=-2.5.
Other parameters were setthe same as baseline.1197Algorithm Compute_SO:1.
Tokenize document d into sentence set S, and eachsentence s?S is tokenized into word set Ws;2.
For any word w in a sentence s?S, compute itsvalue SO(w) as follows:1) if w?DSAAs, compute SO(w) with theintegrated method.If SO(w)=1, SO(w)=Dy_PosValue;If SO(w)=-1, SO(w)=Dy_NegValue;2) if w?Positive_Dict, SO(w)=PosValue;3) If w?Negative_Dict, SO(w)=NegValue;4) Otherwise, SO(w)=0;5) Within the window of q words previous to w, ifthere is a term w'?Negation_Dict,SO(w)= ?SO(w);6) Within the window of q words previous to w, ifthere is a term w'?Intensifier_Dict,SO(w) =??SO(w);3.

We exploitpattern-based and character-based methods toinfer sentiment expectation of nouns, and thendetermine the polarity of DSAAs based on thenouns.
For the sentiment analysis at sentencelevel, our method achieves promising result thatis significantly better than two types of baseline,which validates the effectiveness of ourapproach.
We also apply the disambiguation of14 DSAAs to the sentiment classification ofproduct reviews, resulting obvious improvementin performance, which proves the significance ofthe issue.There leaves room for improvement.
Ourfuture work will explore more contextualinformation in disambiguating DSAAs.
Inaddition, we will find out new methods to reducenoises when mining the Web to infer sentimentexpectation of nouns.
Discovering the lexico-syntactic patterns for sentiment expectation ofnouns automatically or semi-automatically withbootstrapping method is also a challengingdirection.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by National NaturalScience Foundation of China (No.
