++49/(0)6151/875-811, fax -818ABSTRACTIn this paper the text theoretical foundation ofour text analysis ystem KONTEXT is described.The basic premise of the KONTEXT model is thatnew concepts are communicated by using themechanisms of text constitution.
The text modelused assumes that the information conveyed in atext and the information describing its contextualorganization can be structured into five layers(sentence structure, information on thematic pro-gression, referential structure, conceptual repre-sentation of the text and conceptual backgroundknowledge).
The text analysis component con-structs and traverses the information of these lay-ers under control of the discourse development.
Inthis way, it can incrementally construct a textualview on knowledge, rather than only recognizingprecoded concepts.1 INTRODUCTIONIn the field ofknowledge-bMed text analysis ithas been regarded as insufficient to analyze atextagainst he background of static and stereotypicdefault assumptions for some time (cf.
\[Hell-wig84\], \[Scha/Bruce/Polanyi87\]).
By applyingthis method the pre--coded concepts are invokedagain and again during the process of text analysis,regardless of the changes land the new conceptsbeing constituted by the ongoing text.
The func-tion of a text, however, is not confined to conceptselection as in current knowledge-based applica-tions.
In addition, textual mechanisms are used tooperate on concepts and to compose them to actualcontexts, i.e.
to constitute (new) concepts.
Textu-ally the contexts are established by the thematicand by the referential structure.
Thus, new mecha-nisms are required which permit he textual orga-nization to control the creation and manipulationof concepts in text processing.
In a way, this is totie linguistic and knowledge,-based approaches totext processing together into a single method.2 THE KONTEXT MODELThe basic premise of the KONTEXT model isthat he relationship ofexpression and concept arechanged uring a text and concepts are communi-cated by using the mechanisms of text constitu-tion.
The KONTEXT model is based on the as-sumption that?
the information conveyed in a text and theinformation describing its contextual orga-nization can be structured into five layers.They define the sentence structure, informa-tion on thematic progression, the referentialstructure, the conceptual representation fthe text and the conceptual backgroundknowledge;?
discourse provides the basic mechanisms bywhich concepts are constructed.
Discourseis defined as sequences of transitions be-tween discourse states and discourse statesare defined by the information representedin the layers.The text analysis component constructs andtraverses the information of these layers undercontrol of the discourse development.
In this way,it can incrementally construct a textual view onknowledge, rather than only recognizing pre-coded concepts.We will now describe the layers of the text repre-- 263 -sentation.
In the following section we discuss theconception of discourse in more detail.2.1 LAYERS OF TEXT REPRESENTA-TIONThere are five layers of text representation:sentence structurethematic structurereferential structureviewbackground knowledgeThe lowest layer is the basis for textual com-munication.
It is a formal representation f con-cepts modeling an open world and serves as back-ground knowledge.
Since we allow for the con-stmction of new details and concepts, an organi-zation of concepts i provided which supports thistask.
Our background knowledge differs from tra-ditional knowledge bases in that it does not repre-sent a particular domain model which assigns apredefined and fixed structure to the concepts.
It israther organized around expressions and modelstheir referential potential in terms of concepts.
Itresembles a meaning dictionary (like e.g.
\[CO-BUILD87\] which is used as the basic material),where with expressions concepts are constitutedand used to explain other concepts.
Basically allconcepts are of the same rank with respect to anopen world.
During discourse the concepts are ac-cessed via explicitly modeled perspectives onthem \[Kunze90\] \[Melcuk87\] depending on the ac-tual textual development (e.g.
actual state of con-texts, c.f.
2.2 discourse state).The next layer, the view, models the subjectmatter of the text using the concepts which are de-freed in the background knowledge.
The ongoingdiscourse selects concepts from the backgroundknowledge or the already existing view, reorga-nizes their structure and (re-)integrates them co-herently into the already existing view.
The con-cepts constructed in the view during discourseprovide the text specific perspective on the back-ground knowledge.The layer of the referentialstructure representsreference objects and their relationships.
It dropsdetails of the concept definition in accordancewith the abstraction level of references inthe text,and represents hose complexes as units which areexplicitly referred to by linguistic means in thetext.The layer of thematic structure traces the dis-course development.
I  represents he contextualclustering of reference objects and traces the de-velopment of their clustering.
This trace repre-sents the progression of themes and the develop-ment of focusing.
The notion of thematic structureis based on the Prague School approaches tothethematic organization (e.g.
\[Danes70\] \[Hajicov~Sgal188\]\[Hajicov~i/Vrbov~2\]), which we refineby distinguishing the mechanisms involved interms of the textual function of linguistic meanswith respect to the different layers of the text re-presentation.In our model the units of the layer of thematicstructure are contexts.
By context we understand acluster of reference objects, where within a con-text the relationship between a reference expres-sion and its reference object is unequivocal.
Dur-ing the ongoing discourse, however, this relation-ship and the groups of reference objects which areclustered together change.
Whether or not lingui-stic means create new contexts, and which kind ofclustering of reference objects they effect, de-pends on their textual function and on the state ofdiscourse they operate on (examples of this aregiven below).
Contexts are the units of the thema-tic progression.
It is this grouping of reference ob-jects that is referred to by linguistic means imme-diately, that is changed, resumed, revised and tiedup to during discourse.
The thematic structure isthe result of creating, dosing and referring to con-texts.
The movement ofcontexts traces the growthof the view.It should be noted that complex progression typesearl be constructed.
This is due to the ability ofpredicative xpressions to cover several themesby virtue of their arity and due to the textuM~ possi-bility of changing the structure of a contextuallyclustered concept by changing the focus when ref-erring to a context.
Therefore hierarchical struc-tures as proposed by different approaches tode-scribing the structuring of actual texts are not suf-ficient o cope with the ability of natural languagetexts to constitute contextual relations (of.
content- 264 -oriented structures: e.g.
thematic progression\[Danes70\] - at least he five forms elaborated arehierarchical -), or discourse segmentations: e.g.discourse constituent units \[Polanyi88\], contextspaces \[Reichman85\], rhetorical structures\[Mann/Thompson88\], superstructures and ma-crostructures \[vanDijk83\]).The sentence structure describes the linguisticmeans used in the text to express the informationencoded in the lower layers.Our representation models tructural relation-ships of text constitution principles.
The back-ground knowledge provides concepts for the con-sritution of the semantic text representation(view).
The concepts constructed in the view dur-ing discourse provide the text specific perspectiveon the background knowledge.Referential structure and thematic structure achcluster structures of the lower layers.
Referenceobjects group conceptual definitions into unitswhich can be referred to by ensuing linguistic ex-pressions.
The sequence of thematizing defines aclustering of reference objects into contexts.Whilst the lower layers contain more static infor-marion which is independent of the actual se-quence of the textual presentation, the dynamic ofdiscourse, i.e.
the growth of the view during theongoing discourse, is represented in the layers ofthematic structure and sentence structure.The modeling allows for a text driven control ofoperations on the knowledge base and on the view,because the manipulations of the lower layers de-pend on the interpretation f the upper layer phe-nomena.We define the types of manipulations ecessary interms of the contribution linguistic means make tothe layers of the text representation.
The clef'tui-tions are placed in a text lexicon (of.
the examplegiven below).2.2 DISCOURSEBy discourse we understand a sequence ofstate transitions which is guided by the interpreta-tion of linguistic means.
It models textual accessto concepts: A text does not communicate con-cepts at once.
It rather guides sequential accessand operations on knowledge that produce apar-ticular view on the concepts of the backgroundknowledge.A discourse state is defined by the actual stateof all the five layers of the text representation,which renders the actual state of the view and theactual access structure to view and background"knowledge.
While the view grows during the mm-lysis, only a small segment of it is in the focus ofattention at one state, and the objects which are re-tbrred to by linguistic expressions may changestate by state.
A discourse state provides the im-mediate context to which ensuing linguisticmeans can refer directly, and also previous con-texts.The transition of  a discourse state is the effectof the interpretation f alinguistic expression.
It isdetermined by the textual function of linguisticmeans.
Modeling the operational semantics of lin-guistic means within the framework outlinedleads to our text lexica.Differences of the view of two discourse stateswhich are produced by a discourse state transitioncan be regarded as the semantic contribution of alinguistic expression.
But it is important to notethat his contribution is not only determined by theisolated expression, and that therefore analysisdoes not involve a static mapping from a textualexpression to some semantic representation rvice versa.
The contribution rather depends on theactual state of the preceding discourse on whichthe expression operates.
Note also that there areexpressions whose interpretation does not con-tribute to the growth of the view.
In an actual textthey rather are used in order to manipulate he the-matic organization (e.g.
redirections).3 EXAMPLEWith a small example we illustrate how theKONTEXT model works.
We show how a refer-ence object and a concept corresponding to a ref-erential expression is created, and how the rela-tionship between expression and concept ischanged uringthe discourse.
From a sample textwe take the following sentence and show that dis-course state transitions already occur while inter-preting this sentence textually:"The electronic.
: dictionaries that are the goal ofEDR will be dicaonaries of  computers, by comput-ers, and for computers.
"We provide a selection of three discourse statesshowing view and access tructure after the inter-pretation of "The electronic dictionaries" (figure- 265 -l), after "that are the goal of EDR" (figure 2), andafter "will be dictionaries of computers, by com-puters, and for computers."
(figure 3).
Each figurethen is explained by describing the textual func-tion of the linguistic means concerned, i.e.
by de-scribing how they operate on previous discoursestates and what their contribution tothe layers ofthe text representation is.
These definitions areplaced in a text lexicon.
Because we want o drawthe attention to the nature of textual functions oflinguistic means and to the possibility to distin-guish and to describe these functions with respectto the layers of the text representation, we confineourselves to demonstrating this by discussing onlythose readings which lead to a solution in our ex-ample.The sentence structure used is the structure thePLAIN grammar \[Hellwig80\] attributes to a sen-tence, and for the graphical representation of ourexample we use the conventions explained in thelegend (see below).
The names of the roles in theview and in the background knowledge have beenchosen for mnemotechnical reasons only, they arenot to be confused with the conceptual modelingof prepositions.

"does not have an entry "electronic dictionary",which means that in the background knowledge nocorresponding concept exists.
"electronic": As an adjective, "electronic" refersto the reference item --elX-, which does not selecta concept, but a conceptual structure which is usedto extend or to modify the dominating noun's con-cept.
In \[COBUILD87\] there are two conceptualaspects of "electronic", which are related to eachother.
At first "electronic" an be'a device, whichhas silicon chips and is used as a means for elec-tronic methods'.
Secondly 'a method' can be re-ferred to as "electronic".
"dictionary": Initially "dictionary" refers to thereference object <diet>.
Conceptually "dictiona-ry" can refer to two aspects: Itcan refer to' a physi-cal device, which is made of paper and serves as amedium for recording symbols; it has been com-piled by an author and is used for reference pur-poses.'
It can also refer to 'the recorded symbols asa work'.- 266 -"electronic dictionary": In order to find a con-ceptual definition of the imroduced reference ob-ject <eldict> we create a less specific abstract con-cept of dictionary.
On the one hand it must be asspecific as possible, and on the other hand it mustbe compatible with what is known conceptuallyabout the referential item --elX-.
'Electronic dic-tionary' then is a combination of 'electronic' and'dictionary' leaving open e.g.
the incompatibledevice 'paper'.
A more specific concept of "dic-tionary" is introduced.
This: means that from nowon the text will not deal with "dictionaries" ingen-eral, but with "dictionaries" in the restricted con-text of "electronic dictionaries".
Therefore a newcontext is opened, and in this new context "dictio-naries" refers to a new reference object <eldict>which can be the theme of the further ongoing dis-course.Figure 2: "that are the goal of EDR"(ILLOC (PRAED (SUBJE (REFERdi e ) ( ATI'RBel ) .

""that": This relative pronoun, again, forces thecreation of a new context.
A new context isopened which is restricted to those "electronic die-tionaries" only, which "are the goal of EDR".
Thepronoun also has the function of a connexion in-struction \[Kallmeyer/eta177\] and effects areferen-tial equation of "electronic dictionaries" and whatis predicated about "that".
Both expressions andalso "that" then refer to <eldictEDR> in this newcontext.
"are":  It is the textual function of the copula toform a unified context of the contexts of its subject("that") and its predicative complement ("the goalof EDR").
The unified context defines the refer-ence object <eldictEDR>.Figure 3: "will be dictionaries ofcomputers, bycomputers, and for computers"~LLOC (PP.AEDtStmJE (gFa~t .c  ) (ATTRB~j).... .

3 : Discourse state after the interpretation f ,,.will be dictionaries of computers, by c., and for c."dictionaries": The expression "dictionaries ofcomputers, by computers, and for computers" re-fers to three reference objects <dictl>, <dict2>and <diet3> (namely "dictionary" in the context- 267 -of"of', "by", and "for").
The three contexts estab-lished for these reference objects are textually fo-cused on and thus provide the basis for further tex-tual progression.
"will be": The copula, again, forms a unified con-text of the contexts of its subject and its predica-tive complement.
This also effects a referentialequivalence of "electronic dictionary" and "die-tionary".
Therefore "dictionary" must at this stateof the discourse no longer access the concept of"dictionary" of the background knowledge asfreely as at the beginning of the text, when therewas no restriction i  interpretation.
Now it rathermust access the concept which meanwhile hasbeen established by the text (namely 'dictionary'in the sense in which it has been modified and de-freed by 'electronic').
"of, by, for": make further conceptual contribu-tions to the concept of "electronic dictionaries" byrefining the concept by the aspects denoted by"of", "by" and "for".4 CONCLUSIONThe model described in this contributionserves as a theoretical foundation of a computerimplementation f a text analysis ystem.
It en-ables us to model a discourse which can simulatethe communication f new concepts.
In this simu-lation concepts are constituted sequentially bymeans of state transitions which are the effect ofthe interpretation f the actual textual usage of alimited set of linguistic means.
This technique of-fers the possibility to create actual concepts on thebasis of globally and unspecifically defined con-cepts.
Thus texts are regarded as construction i -structions which guide the incremental construc-tion of views on conceptual knowledge bases.5 REFERENCES\[COBUILD87\] Sinclair, John (ed.
