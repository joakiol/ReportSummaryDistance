BaartPhonetics Laboratory, Department ofGeneral LinguisticsCleveringaplaats 1, P.O~Box 95152300 RA Leiden, The NetherlandsAbstractIn this paper we discuss an algorithmfor the assignment of pitch accent positionsin text-to-speech conversion.
The algorithm isclosely modeled on current linoulstic accountsof accent placement, and assumes a surfacesyntactic analysis of the input.
It comprises asmall number of heuristic rules for determiningwhich phrases of a sentence are to be focussedupon; the exact location of a pitch accentwithin a focussed phrase is determined m~inlyon the basis of the syntactic relations holdingbetween the elements of the phrase.
Aperceptual evaluation experiment showed thatthe algorithm proposed here leads to improvedsubjective speech quality as compared to anaive algorithm which accents all and onlycontent words.1.
IntroductionThis paper deals with the prosodic com-ponent of a text-to-speech system for Dutch,more in particular with the rules for assign-ing pitch accents (sentence accents) to wordsin an input sentence.
Whereas other work onaccent rules for Dutch speech synthesis(Kager & Quen6, 1987) did not assume asyntactically analysed input, I will here workfrom the assumption that the text-to-speechsystem has a large dictionary as well as asyntactic parser at its disposal.The paper is organized as follows: insection 2 I shortly introduce the notionsfocus and (pitch) accent as I will be usingthem; as my framework, I will choose theEindhoven model of Dutch intonation Ct Hart& Cohen, 1973; 't Hart & Collier, 1975) inconjunction with Gussenhoven's (1983) accentplacement heory.
In section 3 I discuss therules that connect a domain of focus to anaccent on a particular word.
The assi~mmentof focus domMn~ is dealt with in section 4.At the end of this section I s-mrn~O myproposals in the form of an accent assignmentalgorithm~ In section 5 I present some resultsobtained in a perceptual evaluation of this al-gorithm.2.
A two-stage model of accent placementWork on Dutch intonation at the In-stitute for Perception Research (IPO) inEindhoven has resulted in an inventory ofelementary pitch movements that make up theoccurring Dutch intonation contours ('t Hart& Cohen, 1973; 't Hart & Comer, 1975).
Thephonet ic  character ist ics  of these pitchmovements are known precisely, and thisknowledge can be used in the synthesis ofnatural-sounding Dutch intonation contours.It was found that some of these elementarypitch movements cause the syllable on whichthey are executed to be perceived as ac-cented.
I will use the term pitch accent orsimply accent to refer to prominence causedby the presence of such an accent-lendingpitch movement.
Of course, the intonationmodel does not predict where in a sentencepitch accents or intonational boundaries willbe located, but when these locations areprovided as input, the model is capable ofgenerating a natural-sounding contour.
In theremainder of this paper I will deal specificallywith pitch accent assiLmment.It is relatively standard nowadays toview accent phcement as a process involvingtwo stages (of.
Ladd, 1980; Gussenhoven, 1983;Fuchs, 1984; Baart, 1987): in the first stage itis decided which constituents of a sentencecontain relatively important information (e.g.because they add new information to the back-ground shared by speaker and hearer) and aretherefore to be focussed upon; the decision tofocus certain parts of a sentence and notfocus other parts is based on semantico-pragmatic information and in principle cannotbe pred ic ted  f rom the lexico-syntact icstructure of a sentence.
In the second stage,the exact location of a pitch accent within afocussed constituent is determined;  herelexico-syntactic structure does play a crucialrole.
The following example, cited from Ladd(1980), i l lustrates these ideas.
( In theexamples, pitch accent is indicated by meansof capitaliT~tion.
)- I I I -(1) even a nineteenth century professor ofCLASSICS wouldn't have allowed himselfto be so pedanticIn this case, it is probably the speaker'sintention to focus on the subject NP; we cansay that all the material from a to classics is\[ +focus\], while the rest of the sentence is \[-focus\].
Given the speaker's decision to focuson the subject, an accent is placed by rule onthe last lexical element within this constituent.In the following sections, I first discussthe rules that place an accent within afocussed constituent in Dutch, and next turnto the problem of assigning focus to theconstituents ofa sentence.3.
From focus to accentAs will be clear from the paragraphsabove, I assume that accent placement ispredictable if the focussing structure of asentence is known (for discussion see Gussen-hoven et al, 1987; Baart, 1987).
I adoptGussenhoven's (1983) idea that accent place-ment is sensitive to the argument structure ofa sentence; however, I replace his semanticorientation by a syntactic one and apply theterm argument to any constituent which isselected by the subcategorization frame ofsome lexical head, indudln~ subjects.Input to the accent rules is a binarybranching syntactic constituent ree, whereapart from syntactic category a node isprovided with information concerning itsargument status (either argument or not anargument of some lexical head), and wherenodes dominating a focussed constituent areassigned the feature \[+focus\], while nodesdominating unfocussed material are \[-focus\].In order to arrive at an accentuation pattern,three rules and a well-formedness conditionare to be applied to this input.
A first rule(see (2)) applies iteratively to pairs of sisternodes in the input tree, replacing the syntacticlabels with the labels s (for 'strong') or w (for'weak'), familiar from metrical phonology.
Byconvention, whenever a node is labelled s itssister has to be labelled w and vice versa,the labellings \[s s\] and \[w w\] being excludedfor pairs of sister nodes.
(2) Basic Labelling Rule (BLR):A pair of sister nodes \[A B\] is labelled\[s w\] iff A is an argument; otherwise thelabelling is \[w s\].The funct ion of the w/s-labell ing is toindicate which element of a phrase will bearthe accent when the phrase is in focus: afterthe application of focus assicmment and w/s-labelling rules, an accent will be assigned toevery terminal that is connected to a domin-ating \[ + focus\] node by a path that consists ex-clnsively of s-nodes.In (3) I illustrate the operation of theBLR.
All left-hand sisters in (3) are labelled w,except for the NP een mooi boek, which is anargument.
Granted a focus on the predicate,accent will be assigned to the element boek(there is a path from boek to the \[+focus\]node that consists of s-nodes only).
(3) (ik) heb een mooi BOEK gekochtI have a nice book bought~ sheb ....L.. ~ "  ww s gek~chtoen W S$ .
tmoot boekThe output of the BLR may be modifiedby two additional rules.
First, the Rhythm Ruleaccounts for cases of rhythmical accent shift,see  (4) .
(4) Rhythm Rule (RR, applies to the outputof the BLR):A w....~ s W S"'" C ~ "'" Cw-'hA B A BConditions:(a) C is dominated by a focusCo) B and C are string-adjacent(c) A is not a pronoun, article, ~ prepos-ition or conjunctionIn (5), where we assume focus on both themain verb and the time adverbial, the accentpattern on the adverbial has been modified bythe 1111 (the accent which is normally reali7egion nacht has been shifted to hele).- 112-(5) (hij heeft) de HELE nacht GELEZENhe has the whole niEht readw ~ s\[+focus\] \[+focus\]W ~ S gelezen ('"whele nachtUntil now, nothing prevents the label sfrom being assigned to a node which is \[-focus\].
The following rule, adopted from Ladd(1980) takes care of this case.
The rule makessure that a \[-focus\] node is labelled w; byconvention, its sister node becomes s.(6) Default Accent (DA):s - -P  w\[-focus\]While arguments are normally labelled s andtherefore likely to receive accent, there aresome cases where we do not want an argumentto be accented.
A case in point are \[-focus\]pronouns.
In (Ta) we have an example of alexical object NP (een speld); in (7b) thi~ NPis replaced by a \[-focus\] pronoun (lets).
As aresult of the DA rule, it is the particle (op)that receives the accent in (Tb), instead of theobject.
(7a) (hij raapt) een SPELD ophe picks a pin up\[ + focus\]s ww~'s  op' p~ld een SCo) (hij raapt) iets OPhe picks something up\[ + focus\], .
oW S!
\[-fo,cus\] opietsIn addition to the rules presented thusfar, a well-formedness condition is necessaryin order to account for the focus-accentrelation.
It has been noted by Gussenhoven(1983) that an unaccented verb may not bepart of a focus domain if it is directlypreceded by an accented adjunct.
For in-stance, in (8a)(8a) (in ZEIST) is een FABRIEK verwoestin Zeist is a factory destroyedthe verb (verwoest) is unaccented.
There isno problem here: the VP as a whole is infocus, due to the accent on the argument eenfabdek.
Consider, however, (Sb):(Sb) (in ZEIST) is een FABRIEK door BRANDverwoestin Zeist is a factory by firedestroyedThis is a somewhat strange sentence.
Theaccent on door BRAND arouses an impressionof contrast and the verb vetwoest is out offocus.
A more neutral way to pronounce thissentence isgiven in (8c):(8c) (in ZEIST) is een FABRIEK door BRANDVERWOESTin Zeist is a factory by firedestroyedThe following condition is proposed in orderto account for this type of data:(9) Prosodic Mismatch Condition (PMC):* \ [+focus\ ]  * \ [+focus\ ]o .
.W S S W+ace -ace -ace + aceThe PMC states that within a focus domain aweak (14) constituent (such as door brand in(8b,c)) may not be accented if its strong (s)sister (such as vetwoest in (8b,c)) is unac-cented.4.
Assigning focusAssnrnln~ that a programme for semanticinterpretation of unrestricted Dutch text willnot be available within the near future, thefollowing practical strategy is proposed forassic, ning focus to constituents in a syntactictree.
This strategy is based on the insight thatword classes differ with respect to the amountof information that is typically conveyed bytheir members.
The central idea is to assign113 -\ [+focus\]  to the maximal projections ofcategories that convey extra-grammaticalmeaning (nouns, adjectives, vex'bs, numeralsand most of the adverbs).
In addition, \[-focus\]is assigned to pronouns.
In the case of a coor-dination, \[ +focus\] is assigned to each conjunct.Finally, \[ +focus\] is assigned to the sisters offocus-governing elements like niet 'not', ook'also', alleen 'only', ze~fs 'even', etc.
Below Iinformally present an accent assignmentalgorithm which combines these focusassignment heuristics with the focus-to-accentrules discussed insection 3:(1) Read a sentence with its surface struc-ture representation.
(2) Assign the labels w and s to nodes inthe tree, according to the BLR above.
(3) Assign \[-focus\] topronouns.
(4) Apply DA: if an s-node is \[-focus\],replace s by w for this node and w by sfor its sister.
(5) Apply the RR, starting out from themost deeply embedded subtrees.
(6) Assign \[+focus\] to S, (non-pronomlnal)NP, AP, AdvP and NumP nodes.
(7) Assign \[+focus\] to each member of acoordination.
(8) Assign \[+focus\] to the sister of a focusgovernor.
(9) Assign \[+focus\] to every s-node, thesister of which has been assigned\[ + focus\] (thus avoiding prosodic mis-match, see the PMC above).
(10) Assign accent to each word that isconnected to a dominating \[+focus\] nodevia a path that consists exclusively of s-nodes.
(11) Stop.5.
Perceptual evaluationThe accent assi~ment algorithm has beenimplemented as a Pascal programme.
Input tothis programme is a Dutch sentence; the useris asked to provide information about syntac-tic bracketing and labelling, and about theargument status of constituents.
The pro-gramme next assigns focus structure and w/slabelling to the sentence and outputs thepredicted accent pattern.A small informative text was used forevaluation of the output of the programme.
Inthis evaluation experiment, the predictedaccent patterns were compared with the accentpatterns spontaneously produced by a humanreader, as well as with the accent patterns aspredicted by a naive accentuation algorithmwhich assigns an accent to every contentword.
Listeners were asked to rate the qualityof sentences ynthesized with the respectiveaccent patterns on a 7-point scale.
As asnmmary of the results, I here present themean scores for each of the conditions:Spontaneous accentuatiom 5.2Sophisticated algorithm: 4.6Naive algorithm" 3.3As one can see, human accentuation is stilipreferred over the output of the algorithm ofsection 4.
Of course this is what we expect,as the algorithm does not have access to thesemantico-pragmatic properties of an inputtext, such as coreferenco and contrast.
Onthe other hand we see that the algorithm,which does take syntactic effects on accentplacement into account, offers a substantialimprovement over a simple algorithm based onthe content word - function word distinction.ReferencesBaart, Joan L.G.
