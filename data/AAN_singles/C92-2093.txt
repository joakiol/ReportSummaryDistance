The work described inthis paper deals with text generation applied to a particulartype of explanations: causal explanations ofphysical sys-tems.
They have akeady motivated influential develop-ments in the field of qualitative reasoning about physicalsystems.
A central goal of the theories developed in \[DeKleer 84\] and \[Forbus 84\] was to elaborate conceptualframeworks for providing causal accounts of physical sys-tems, sensitive to our commonsense understanding of thephysical world.
Those qualitative causal models constitutean adequate starting point as we are interested inhow peo-ple present such causal explanations in verbal form.We will describe our approach for text generation, based outhe study of texts collected in encyclopedia and textbooks,and currently developed in a system intended to be asso-ciated to the qualitative simulation system SQUALE\[J6z6quel & Zimmer 92\].
Our conceptual model, whichconstitutes the input o the text generation process, isbasedon Qualitative Process Theory IForbus 84\].According to the "traditional" division of tasks in textgeneration, the transition from conceptual representationof causal behaviour to causal explanation i natural lau-gouge is viewed as a three-stage process: content specifica -tion, text organization and surface generation.The content specification task aims at posting communica-tive goals described by means of communicative acts onconceptual entities.
In particular, the causal explanation tobe produced isoften restricted to ,some particular events ofthe causal behaviour.
We will show how relevant informa-tion and appropriate communicative acts are identified.Text organization is the most elaborate part of our modeland is also divided into three tasks.The first is concerned with the construction of a textualstructure from a set of communicative acts established dur-ing content specification.
This structure, which takes an in-termediary place between communicative acts and surfacerealizations, pecifies essentially prescriptions on group-ing and ordering of textual units.
This process is achievedthrough the application of discourse strategies which con-trol local Iransitions from communicative acts to possibleorganizational preseriptions.
We dcseribe three strategiesused for structuring causal explanations: a causal chainstrategy (for organizing simple causal chains), a parallelstrategy (to impose a parallel structure on the text), and aconcessive strategy (for performing concessive acts).
Thesecond task segments the textual structure into sententialcontents.
Several factors are revolved, mainly communica-tive form of textual relations and number of textual uniteexpressed ina sentence.
7'he stylistic adjustment task dealswith stylistic considerations related to lexico-syntacticchoice, s. We want o ensure an inter-sentential compatibili-ty, from a stylistic point of view, between linguistic realiza-tions.Concerning surface generation, two types of systems havebeen considered: a sentence geuerator \[Fournier 91\] basedon the Meaning-Text Theory \[Mel'cuk 88a\] and a syntacticcomponent based on equivalenee classes between sentencestructures.Our approach suggests a clear separation of knowledgesources involved in each of these stages.
We will start witha presentation f the conceptual model, where we proposea characterization of causal interactions betweeo physicalevents (essentially, physical parameter changes).
The nextsections deal with the different stages of the text generationprocess.AcrEs DE COLING-92, NA~res, 23-28 no(n' 1992 6 1 7 PRoc.

23-28, 1992H-  THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKQualitative Process Theory helps to capture commonsenseknowledge implicit in mathematical models of traditionalphysics.
Besides, it provides an ontological framework forexpressing physical causality, by expliciting the physicalmechanisms.
In order to describe physical situations, twokinds of structures are used : individuals views, for repre-senting physical objects and behavioural bstractions, andphysicalprocesses such as fluid and heat flows.
Gradualparameters are associated toidentified entities (individualviews and processes) and causal dependencies are ex-pressed by means of two types of qualitative relations: in-fluences, for direct effects of processes, and qualitativeproportionalities, which propagate direct effects of pro-eesses on the other parameters.
It follows that the initialcause of a parameter change is always a process.Qualitative relations can aim at opposite ffects.
In diephysical situation of figure 1, the mercury expansion tendsto increase the mercury level while the tube expansiontends to lower it.
The first influence is predominant, sincean increase of the mercury level is observed in that situa-tion, and thus the second is inhibited 1.
In order to representdifferent types of causal interactions, we have introducedthe causal primitives cause, contrary-cause and opposite-effects which are defined according to influences betweenevents:,, cause: causal relation between two events linked with apredominant influence (for example, mercury expansionis the cause of mercury level rise)?
contrary-cause:  contrastive r lation between twoevents linked with an inhibited influence.
One of theevents is the "contrary cause" of the other (tube xpansionis a contrary cause of mercury level rise).?
opposite-effects: contrastive r lation between twoevents which aim at opposite ffects (mercury expansionand tube expansion).The last two primitives are called causal opposition rela-tions.
In that framework, physical system behaviours arerepresented with influence graphs, where physical eventsare linked with causal primitives.
An influence graph en-closes all events and causal interactions identified in thegiven physical situation.I11 - CONTENT SPECIFICATIONThe content specification is primarily concerned with se-lection of relevant physical events and causal interactionsfrom the influence graph.
But the problem should not benarrowed to factual knowledge selection, for the conceptu-1.
It does not mean that he mercury expansion has no effecton the mercury level but that no effect is perceived at thatlevel of a~tr~ction.ul content of the text cannot be considered independentlyof the speaker's communicative intentions.
Communica-tive roles assigned to conceptual entities have crucial im-plications at each stage of the text generation process.Hence, they should be made xplicit at the content specifi-cation level as well as their elated conceptual units.
In ourmodel, the content specification task results in a setofcom-municafive acts, which represents he illocutionary struc-ture of the message.
These acts are performed so as to pro-duce some effects on the hearer, as modifying his beliefsystem or affecting his emotional states.
They may be char-acterized according to these in tended effects.
We foc us hereon three types of acts: inform, explain and concede, and es-pecially in the context of causal explanation production.Roughly speaking, an act of informing aims at making thehearer believe some proposition while an act of explaining,viewed as a discourse act, has the effect of Supporting a pre-viously introduced proposition i order to favour its accep-tance.
(1) and (2) are respective realizations of acts of in-forming and explaining:(1) La dilatation du mercure provoque la hausse duniveau de mercure,(The mercury expansion causes the rise of the mercurylevel.
)(2) Le niveau de mercure monte, paree que le mercure sedilate.
(The mercury level rises, because of the mercuryexpansion.

In contrast, (2) contains two assertions, the secondassuming an explicative function.
Note that in beth easesthe same conceptual content is involved.
Some differencesbetween sentences (1) and (2) as the order of informationunits are due to distinct communicative role assignments.We will show in the next .section how these intended "rhe-torical" effects influence choices at the text organizationlevel.But now let us turn to the content specification procedures.The determination f communicative acts highly dependson the problem solving activity (here, qualitative simula-2.

1992tion) andthus i governed by both general rhetorical princi-ples and domain dependent considerations.
It proceeds asan incremental process and each step determines more pre-cisely the relevant information.
First the notion of theme-object, similar to global focus \[Grosz 86\] (and adapted togeneration by Mc Keown), is used to carry out a rough se-lectiou of relevant causal interactions: events which are notin (direct or indirect) causal interaction with any theme-object are ignored.
The theme-object identification de-pends on the user interaction mode with the system.
In thesimplest cases, theme--objects an be identified with privi-leged properties of the physical system, such as outputs ofan artifact.
But in a dialogue system, an analysis of userqueries is necessary.Second, the selection isrefined and emnmunicative acts areselected according to user's beliefs and expectations ex-pressed in his request.
Esr, ccially, communicative acts oncausal opposition relations are introduced in two kind ofsituation: (a) if a complete description of causal behaviouris required or (b) within a concessive strategy, which seem sappropriate when the user focuses on an expected but yetunoeccurred vent.
For example, in order to reply to thequestion "why doesn't the mercury level drop ?
", causal op-position relations are not ignored for it suggests that theuser is interested with inhibited influences which mighthave caused a mercury drop.
Similar considerations areexpressed in Mc Coy's shemata for correcting misconcep-tions about object classifications \[McCoy 89\].IV -  TEXT ORGANIZATIONText organization deals with multiple communicative actssimultaneously.
This is one of the main features of our ap-proach for it provides the ability to impose a global struc-ture on the text.
Global coherence cannot be ensured ifcommunicative acts are considered independently of oneanother.
Additionally, there is not a one to one correspon-dence between communicative acts and sentences of thetext.
A single utteranceoften r alizes multiplecomm unica-live acts and inversely a single act may be spread on severalutterances.
For example, sentence (1) may also be utteredso as to achieve the three following acts: informing thehearer of mercury expansion and mercury level rise, andthat these events are causally related.
This conception inlanguage generation has been initiated by Appelt in theKAMP system \[Appelt 85\].
He showed how multiple illo-cutionary acts can be achieved in a single utterance.Communicative acts are not directly mapped to linguisticforms.
The textual structure is introduced as an intermedi-ary level of abstraction between the specified content andthe text.
It is mainly composed of textual units, inter-clau-sal relations, which indicate how these units should be re-lated, and order prescriptions.IE.I - Inter -Clausal  RelationsSeveral text generation systems use inter-clausal relationswhich have been introduced in textual inguistics undervarious forms \[Grimes 75\], \[Van Djik 81\], \[Halliday 761.R hetorical Structure Theory (RST) \[Mann &Thompson 87\]is a signi fican tapproach of this trend and it has been partial-ly used in text planning systems \[Hovy 88\], \[Moore &Swartout 89\].
In RST, the structure of a text is obtained bycomposition of rhetorical relations expressing variouskindsof dependencies, ~metimes semantic ("subject mat-ter" relations in RST terminology), sometimes purely rhe-toricai (presentational re ation in RST).
In contrast, in ourapproach the intended rhetorical effects are considered ascommunicative goals and are specified at the content speci-fication level.
As a consequence, inter-clausal relations in-volved in our system are exclusively semantic.
Further-more, they are characterized in a way similar to theparatactic/hypotactic distinction of rhetorical predicates\[Grimes 75\] so that hey can take different communicativeforms.
Under the equiponderant form, the same interest isassigned to the arguments of the relation while under thepreponderant form, one of them is presented as more cen-tral.Arguments of relations are composed of textual units,which are semantic translations ofconceptual entities.
Anargument may be simple (limited to a single textual unit) orcomplex (composed of several textual units).At present our work on inter-clausal relations focuses oncausal and adversative r lations (i.e.
on relations involvedin the expression of our causal primitives).IV.I.I - Causal Inter-Clausal RelationsIn the cause-effect inter-clausal relation, events denoted inthe first argument are presented as being the cause of eventsdenoted in tile second.
According to the communicativeform (equipondorant or preponderant) of the relation, dif-ferent ypes of communicative acts may be achieved.
Thefollowing elementary transitions (in a simplified form)both lead to the intrc~luction f a cause-effect relation (inPROLOG notation, arguments in capitalized letters repre-sent variables):transition(inform_of_a_causal link,inform(cause(C,t~ ),cause-effect(equi,C,E)).transition(explain with a causal link,\[explain(C,E),cause(C, E)I,cau.~'e-effect(pre, C, E)).But there is not necessarily a direct correspondence b -tween relations of conceptual level and relations of textuallevel, as in the above transitions.
Hence, the following tran-sition may hold in some context, even if no causal interac-tion exists between on the one hand C 1, E 1 and on the otherhand C2, E2:transition(inform of_multiple_causal links,linform(cause(C1 ,El)),ir(orm( cause( C2,E2 )) l,cause-effect( equi,\[ C1 ,C2\],\[E1 ,E21)ACTes DE COTING-92, NANTES.

23-28, 1992IV.I.2 Adversative lnter~7.1ausal RelationsAs mentioned in section H, behavioural description of aphysical system contains not only causal inks betweenevents but also causal opposition relations.
These relationsare often phrased in natural language with concessive con-nectives (but, though, however,...) which, following Piaget\[Piaget 78\], express a discordance between cause am1 ef-fect.
The sentences (3) and (4) illustrate respectively ex-pressions of contrary~cau.~e and opposite-effects rela-tions:(3) Le tube se dilate uu~is le niveau de mercure raonte.
(The tube expands but the mercury level rises.
)(4) Le tube se dilate raais le mercure se dilate aussi.
(The tube expands but the mercury expands too.
)The study of linguistic onnectives within the linguisticTheory of Argumentation \[An~ombre&Ducrot 83\], \[Aas-combre 84\] and especially the French connective mais(but) has showed that two kinds of semantic oppositionmay be expressed by concessive connectives: direct oppo-sition, where one of the two linked propositions i pres-ented as an argument for a conclusion oppo~d to the otherproposition, and indirect opposition, where the two propo-sitions are presented as arguments for opposite conclu-sions.
(3) conveys adirect opposition since the conclusion(the mercury level drop) aimed by the first proposition isopposed to the second one (the mercury level rise) and (4)conveys an indirect opposition since the two propositionsaim at opposite conclnsions (mercury level drop and mer-cury level rise).In order to represent these semantic oppositions, we haveintroduced the adversative inter~zlausal relations direct-opposition and indirect-opposition.
Acts of informing oncausal opposition relations are then realized by means ofthese adversative r lations:transition(inforra_of a_contrary_cause,inform( contr ar y-catt~e( C,E ) ),direct-opposition(pre,C,E)).transition(inform_of_oppositeeffects,inform(opposite-effects(C1 , 2)),indirect.~opposition(equi,Cl ,C2)).But also concessive acts, taking advantage of the conces-sive nature of adversative r lations:transition(concede a contrary_cause,lconeede(C1),inform( cause( C2,E2 ) ),opposite effects(C1 ,C2)1,\[indirect--opposition(equi,Cl ,C2),cause-eff ect( equi,C2,E2 ) \] ).IV .2  - I :  rom content specification to textual structureA s we diseussed earlier, corn manicafi ve acts should not beexamined independently ofoneanother if one wants topro~duce well-structured texts.
A local transition represents apossible treatment ofa limited number of communicativeacts at textual level.
Hence, choice and application of localtransitions are governed by discourse strategies, They de-termine transitions which may be applied after an analysisof the overall set of communicative acts.
In particular, theycxploit he underlying conceptual structure ofcomnurnica-live acids.
For cau~l explanations, the mainly used strate-gies are the following:?
Causal Chain Strategy: If the underlying conceptualstructure isa causal chain and communicative acts are ofthe inform or explain type then lollow causal order andapply transitions informofa_causallink andexplain with a causal link (cffig 2).
* Parallel Strategy: It is a form of parallelism rhetorical"figure" which may be used when the underlying con-ceptual structure is comlx~sed of two causal chains witha common initial cause.
This strategy also exploit hecausal order and transitions inform of commoncause link and inform of multiple causal_links holdthe highest priorities (cffig 3).tramition(inform of common_cause_linLL\[inform(cause(C,El )),inform( cause( C ,E2 ) ) \] ,cause-effect( equi,C ,\[E l ,E21)?
Concessive Strategy: This strategy deals with concessiveacts which involve causal opposition relations.A preferential order is suggested: the conceded fact pre--cedes the other units.Priorities are assigned to the strategies so that conflicts canbe solved.IVJ - Textual Structure SegmentationThe purpose of the segmentation task is to delimit he con-tent of the ~utences which will constitute the final text.The determination f a sentential content involves everalheuristics.
Some of them aim at increasing the scope of thesentence while others aim at reducing it.
One of the mainheuristics deals with the communicative nature of inter-clausal relations: ince preponderant relations often appearin subordinate forms at syntactic level, equiponderant rela-tions are privileged.
Hence, delimitation of sentential con-tent starts with the choice of equiponderant relations.
Thecontent is then completed with preponderant relations.
Inaddition, the number of textual units of a sentence islimitedand introduced relations may be removed from the senten-tial content if it contains too many textual units.
The seg-mentation is "also coustralued by the conceptual nature ofinlormation units.

23-28, 1992V-  SURFACE GENERATION VI - RELATED WORKSThe text planner is independent of the surface generationcomponent.
(except the stylistic adjustment task).
Two dif-ferent ypes of sentence generation approaches have beenexamined.Oar main approach aims at coupling the text planning sys-tem with a generic sentence generator \[Fournier 91 \] basedon the Meaning-Text Theory \[Mel'cuk 88\].
In the Mea-ning-Text Model, the input representation is a semanticnetwork enriched with several structures, mainly the bipar-titions theme/rheme, asserted/presupposed and given/new.The construction of semantic networks is based on a con-ceptual-semantic d tionary, which specifies correspon-dences between concepts and semantic definitions.
The gi-ven~new structure has already been integrated in textgeneration systems (e.g.
INirenburg 88\]).
Itdenotes speci f-ic linguistic onstructions and will constrain choices dur-ing realization.
For instance, a predicative structure will berather ealized as an assertion if it belongs to the new partor as a nominalization if it belongs to the given part.
Thischaracterization of semantic representations plays a crucialrole from a textual perspective.
The generation processmust be sensitive to progression of new informationthrough the text, even at the realization stage.
In this spirit,distribution of semantic units among given and new partsis carried out with regard to conceptual units introduced inprevious entences.
Predicative structures of the semanticnetwork whose referents have been previously evoked aresystematically marked as given and the others as new.
Oncethe semantic representation is built (only the semantic net-work and the given/new structure have been considered),the realizer produces surface forms and paraphrases may begenerated, essentially by lexical substitutions.The second approach we are experimenting relies on equiv-alence classes between sentence structures, which may becompared to Discourse Grammars described in \[Danlos85\].
An equivalence class represents potential realizationsof a kind of semantic content.
Our investigation is currentlylimited to classes related to causality.
We have definedclasses for expressing causal and opposition relations.
Thiscategorization f linguistic expressions provides asuitablebasis for stylistic adjustment mechanisms.
Syntactic andlexical constraints arising from stylistic considerationsgovern the choice of sentence structures within classes.
Inparticular, we have implemented a "principle of stylisticvariety" which prevents excessive use of similar syntacticconstructions.
This principle is particularly useful in causalexplanation generation because concepts involved are ofsimilar types.
To illustrate this point, let us consider the textin figure 2.
When generating the last sentence, stylistic ad-justment recommends the realizer to avoid coordinativestructures (with connectives such as thus, consequently, ...)since such a construction has been used in the previous en--tence.
A structure with a verb conveying causality (e.g.
tocause, to result in, ...) is then selected.Our system benefits from a number of earlier works on lan-guage generation, as those we have mentioned along theabove sections.
We will focus the comparison on two par-ticular points.
The first concems the overall architectureand modularization in text generation systems; the seconddeals with text planning applied to causal explanation gen-eration.
Text planning and surface generation have oftenbeen conceived as separated components.
But separation ftasks is not always extended within text planning.
For ex-ample, rhetorical schemata used in TEXT \[McKeown 85\]specify in the same structure not only information unitswhich may be introduced bat also their orders in the finaltext.
Other systems as GOSSIP \[Carcagno & Iordanskaja89\] and PAULINE \[Hovy 88b\] have isolated content deter-mination from text structuring.
The approach described inthis paper also proposes a clear separation of the contentspecification and the textual organization skills.
The mainmotivation behind this division is that it is convenient tode-cide what o say (more precisely, to set (almost) all commu-nicative goals to achieve) before taking any organizationaldecisions.
Hence, content specification proceeds regard-less of structuring considerations.
However, we think thata more cooperative interaction between these two majorcomponents is necessary toallow goal revisions at the textorganization level.Oar system can also be compared to TAILOR \[Paris 87\]which generates natural language descriptions ofphysicaldevices.
A significant advantage ofTAILOR is its ability tocombine structural nd causal description strategies.
Nev-ertheless, causal interactions are restricted to simple causallinks and there is no attempt to explicit he roles they canplay la discourse.VII - FUTHER DEVELOPMENTSFirst a better conceptual characterization of physical sys-tems would contribute to improve the quality of causal ex-planations.
We need a more precise description of causal in-teractions which allows, for instance, to discern enable~ment conditions from other causal inks.With regards to text planning, number of extensions arepossil)le.
We intend to define strategies for structural de-scriptions and also enhance the control mechanisms of dis-course strategies.
Furthermore, practical validation of theoverall approach requires a larger coverage of communica-tive acts.
Another interesting extension would consist inrelating stylistic adjustment mechanisms to pragmatic fea-tures \[Hovy 89\] in order to strengthen context sensitivity.AcknowledgmentsI would like to thank Corinne Fournier and Marie-42hris-tine Escalier for their comments on earlier versions of thispaper.ACRES nE COLING-92, NANTES.
