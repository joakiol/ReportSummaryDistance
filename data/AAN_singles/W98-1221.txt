eduAbst rac tThis paper mainly presents aTurkish sentencegenerator for producing the actual text fromits semantic description.
To concentrate onthe text generation rather than text planning,we assume that the lexicalized semantic de-scription of the text is produced in some way,currently given by hand.
In the generation,we need a linguistic theory to describe thelinguistic resources, and also a software toolto perform them in a computational environ-ment.
We use a functional linguistic theorycalled Systemic-Functional Grammar (SFG)to represent the linguistic resources, and FUFtext generation system as a software tool toperform them.
In this paper, we present hesystemic-functional representation and real-ization of simple Turkish sentences.1 In t roduct ionNatural anguage generation isa kind of process thatencodes the mental picture of reality into a sequenceof words called grammatical units such as clause,verbal group, noun group etc.
The units of a gram-mar can be ordered in terms of a rank scale, fromthe largest o the smallest unit (structural classifi-cation) (Halliday, 1985): a sentence consists of oneor more clauses; a clause consists of one or morephrases (groups); a phrase consists of one or morewords; a word consists of a root word, and zero ormore morphemes; a morpheme is the smallest unit.A simple sentence consists of only one main pro-tess and several components that complement ormodify the main process.
Each component may berealized by complex syntactic structures but it doesnot change the simple structure of the sentence.
Inother words, the number of words in a sentence doesnot determine whether the sentence is simple or not.The main property of the simple sentence is thateach component in the sentence has a function thatis determined by the main process such as actor,*This work was supported by NATO Science for sta-bility Project Grant TU-LANGUAGE.goal, time, manner, etc.
A complex sentence con-sists of more than one simple sentence that may bestructurally or semantically connected to each other.Because the generation of simple sentences must beachieved before the generation of complex sentences,we concentrate on the generation of simple sentencesin this paper.We analyze simple Turkish sentences from thesystemic-functional perspective to determine theirstructural and functional descriptions (Patten,1988).
By using these descriptions, we have con-structed the system network of simple sentences andwe have implemented a sentence generator in Func-tional Unification Formalism (FUF) (Elhadad, 1990-2) to perform the linguistic resources.
In our analy-sis, we determine the main process, participants andcircumstantials of a simple sentence, and how theyare realized in Turkish.The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-lows.
In Section 2, we consider the grammaticalanalysis of the simple sentence.
We present thefunctional analysis of simple sentences, which de-termines participants and their realizations in Turk-ish.
We paid a special attention to the verbal grouppart of sentences which is used in the realization ofthe process.
Section 3 gives a brief overview of thesystemic-functional grammar approach to text gen-eration, and particularly presents the system net-work of the simple sentence.
Next, in Section 4, theimplementation f a Turkish sentence generator isintroduced, and then the generation of simple sen-tences is demonstrated.
Finally, Section 5 presentsconclusion and future work.2 Grammat ica l  Ana lys i s  o f  S impleSentences2.1 Pred icate  Types of SentencesTurkish sentences can be divided into two groupsdepending on the type of their predicates: verbal andnominal sentences.
If the predicate of the sentenceis derived from a verb, it is called a verbal sentence.Cicekli and Korkmaz 165 Generation of Simple Turkish SentencesIlyas Cicekli and Turgay Korkmaz (1998) Generation of Simple Turkish Sentences with Systemic-Functional Grammar.

Powers (ed.)
NeMLaPS/CoNLL98: New Methods in Language Processing and Computational Natural LanguageLearning, ACL, pp 165-173.If the predicate is derived from a nominal I group, itis called a nominal sentence.In verbal sentences, a verb is used as a base of averbal group, other information such as time, mode,person is realized as suffixes to this base.
The fol-lowing is an example for a Turkish verbal sentence.
(1) Yarm okul-a gid-ece~-iz.Tomorrow schooI+DAT gO+FUT+IPL'We will go to school tomorrow.
'In positive nominal sentences, a nominal groupbecomes a finite verb with a substantive verb whichis used as an auxiliary verb to demonstrate "to be"meaning of the predicate in four grammatical tenses:present, past, narrative and conditional.
(2) a. Ahmet balkan-dinAhmet chairman+coP.
'Ahmet is the chairman.'b.
Klz ~ok giizel-di.Girl very beautiful+PAST'The girl was very beautiful.
'The negative sense of the nominal sentence is rep-resented by a separate negative word de~?1 (not tobe) for the tenses mentioned above.
(3) Ahmet balkan de~il-dir.Ahmet chairman NegNoun+coP.
'Ahmet is not the chairman.
'The other tenses in the nominal sentences are ex-pressed by the auxiliary verb ol  (be).
In this case,the auxiliary verb is realized the same way as thepredicate of a verbal sentence.

'2.2 Functional AnalysisFrom the functional perspective, all languages tryto realize the common semantic functions with theirown grammatical structures and lexical items.
Inthis section, we consider the realization of each se-mantic function in Turkish.A clause 2 (simple sentence) consists of three func-tional components: process, participants, and cir-cumstantials.
Process is the main constituent thatrepresents an event or a state.
Participants are per-sons or things involved in a process.
Circums~antialsare the optional constituents o describe the processfrom different perspective such as time, place, man-ner etc.Participants and circumstantials are specifiedwith new semantic functions to represent the speciala Nominal is' a common ame for nouns and adjectives2Clause is used as a common ame for sentences orsentence-like structures.meanings, roles or relations in the clause.
The spe-cific participant functions depend on the type of pro-cess.
The transitivity and ergativity analysises (Hal-liday, 1985) allow us to classify the processes in thelanguage, and to describe the configuration of par-ticipants.
The specific circumstantial functions donot strictly depend on the type of the process, andthey are optionally used to give more informationabout the process.2.2.1 Transiv i ty AnalysisTransitivity analysis pecifies the different ypesof processes recognized in the language, and deter-mines the participants depending on these types.
Inthis way, the logical relationships between the pro-cess and participants are provided.
The types ofprocesses and their special participants may be clas-sifted as follows.1.Material processes express the notion that someentity "does" something which may be done "to"some other entity.
Material processes contain actoras an obligatory participant that represents he onethat does the deed, and goal as an optional partici-pant that represents the one that the process is ex-tended to.
Material processes are realized by verbalsentences in Turkish.2.Mental processes express feeling, thinking, andperceiving activities of humans.
There are two par-ticipants in a mental process: senser who is the con-scious being that senses, and phenomenon that is athing or a fact which is sensed.
Mental processes arealso realized by verbal sentences in Turkish.3.Relational processes express the way of "being".Relational processes can be classified according tothe type of "being", and the explanation mode of"being".
The type of "being" can be intensive, cir-cumstantial and possessive.
Each type can be ex-plained in two modes: attributive and identifying.As a result, the six types of relational processes canOCCUr.The special participants for relational processes aredetermined epending on the mode of "being".
Inthe attributive mode, there are two participants:carrier that is an entity to that an attribute is as-c.ribed, and attribute is a determiner that is ascribedto carrier.
The participant identifier is used toidentify the participant identified in the identifyingmode.In Turkish, relational processes are realized by nom-inal sentences.
In other words, the process of be-ing is expressed by a substantive verb or a distinctauxiliary verb ol (be) depending on the time of thesentence.
The attribute is conflated with the pro-cess of the sentence in the attributive mode, andthe identifier is conflated with the process in theidentifying mode.
Thus, these two participants areused as nominal bases of verbal groups in the re-Cicekli and Korlanaz 166 Generation of Simple Turkish SentencesIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIi lIIIIIIalization of the process.
However, in the attribu-tive mode of the possessive relation, a distinct wordsahip (have) is used as the nominal base in the re-aiization of the process, and the attribute is realizedas a noun phrase in the dative case.4.Existential processes express that something ex-ists or happens.
There is only one participant: en-tity.
To express that entity exists or not, two dis-tinct nouns vax (exist) and yok (absent) are respec-tively used in Turkish.
Thus, existential processesare also realized as nominal sentences, and these dis-tinct nouns are used as nominal bases in the realiza-tion of the process.2.2.2 Ergat iv i ty  AnalysisIf the process is "caused"-ergative, the analysis ofthe ergativity is required to find the functions agent(causer) and medium (affected) as participants ofthe process.
Sometimes medium is conflated withactor, and sometimes with goal.
In addition, theagent and the actor may be different participantsto explain the fact that someone (agent) is causingsomeone lse (actor) to perform the process.
Forinstance, in (5), Al l  (the agent) caused Veli (theactor) to paint the table.
(5) Ali masa-yl Veli-'ye boya-t-tl.All table+AcC Veli+DAw paint+caus+PASW'Ali had Veli paint the table.
'In Turkish, the causation hierarchy may be morecomplex.
More than one agent-like participants mayappear between the agent and the actor to explainthat someone is causing another causing another andso on to perform the process.
For example, an addi-tional participant agent-2 is illustrated in (6).

Cir-cumstantial functions can be decomposed into sevenclasses and their possible realizations in Turkish aresummarized in Table 1.

Since Turkish is a free wordorder language, the syntactic functions in the sen-tence can be freely ordered to construct he sen-tence.
Although the constituents can be freely or-dered, each order provides the additional informa-tion to explain the different extual functions of eachconstituent.
The textual functions can be identifiedas follows (Erguvanh, 1979; Hoffman, 1995):?
the sentence-initial position as topic ..?
the immediately preverbal position as focus?
the postverbal position as background informa-tionIn the realization, each constituent may be conflatedwith one of these functions, and these functions arestrictly ordered as shown in the following template4:Topic ... Focus Process BackgroundNaturally, the number of constituents in the sen-tence may be increased, and they can not be con-rated with any textual function.
For those kindsof constituents, we use a default word order in theimplementation.PP for post-positional phrase; AdvG for adverb group;NOM for nominative; DAT for dative; ABL for abla-tive; LOC for locative; INS for instrumental; PRI forprivative.4The dements are represented in partial order.
Threedots represent that different functions may be located.Cicekli and Korkmaz 167 Generation of Simple Turkish SentencesIn spite of the free word order characteristic ofTurkish, there are:some grammatical constraints onthe word order.
If direct-object is not focused in thesentence (7.a), it must be realized as a definite ele-ment.
If direct-object is an indefinite lement (7.b),it must be adjacent with the process.
Otherwise, itwill be ungrammatical (7.c).

A verbal group is con-structed on a lexical element called base that canbe a verb or a nominal group.
The base is the sin-gle lexical element hat is given for the formationof a verbal group.
The other lexical elements (suchas de~?1 (neg.
noun), m:i.
(question), ol  (be)), therelevant suffixes and the components of the verbalgroup are determined and organized by the systemic-functional grammar designed for Turkish to expressappropriate meanings.
This section presents thepossible structures of verbal groups and their inter-nal organization i  Turkish (Banguo~lu, 1986; Ko~,1990).There are more than one grammatical structureof verbal groups to express many distinct mean-ings.
Fortunately, they may be generalized accord-ing to the type of base (nominal group, verb) andthe mood (finite, non-finite).
The selected featuresfrom these two systems (type-of-base and mood) de-termine the appropriate structure for the verbalgroup.
The selected features from other systems inFigure 1.b (given in Section 3) organize the inter-nal structure of the verbal group.
As a result, thefollowing four general structures can occur:1. base is a verb and mood is finite:This case is selected to realize the pro.
cess of a verbalsentence, or question.
The.type of the process can bematerial or mental.
The structure of verbal groupsin this case is shown in Table 2 for the following ex-amples in (8).
5 There exist two distinct componentsSThe structures are considered in the tabular forms.The center ow of the table describes the required func-tional elements of the verbal group in a grammatical or-der.
The top rows of the table give examples, and bottomrows present heir grammatical values, respectively.
M-P-N stands for Mode, Person, and Number; VF standsfor Voice Frame; POL stands for Polarity; DV stands forDescriptive Verb; DP stands for Descriptive Polarity.of the verbal group for interrogative s ntences (ques-tions): base and interrogative tag.
The mode,person, and number are added to base or interrog-at ive tag depending on the selected values of thesefunctions.
(8) a. Arkad~-lar-m-1 sev-ebil-meli-sin.friend+3PL+2PP+ACC Iove+POT+NEC+2SG' You ought to be able to love your friends.
'b.Mektub-u yaz-dzr-acak mz-y&-n?letter+Ace write+cAUS+FUT Ques+PAST+2SG' Were you going to have the letter written?'2.
base is a verb and mood is non-finite:The structure of finite verbal group of a verbal sen-tence can be used in this case by replacing the finitewith a non.finite lement.
A non-finite verbal grouprealizes the process of a clause that may be used asa noun (infinitive), adjective (participle) or adverb(adverbial).
As a result, the structure of this casefor the following examples i given in Table 3.
(9) a. Birisi tarafmdan sev.il-mek giizel-dir.someone by IOVe+PASS+INF" nice+coP'It is nice to be loved by someone.'b.

'sev -il -reekoku -yacakko,~ -arakBase VF POL DV DP Non-Finiteverb ... pos none infinitiveverb ... pos none participleverb ... pos none adverbialTable 3: Non-Finite Verbal Group from Verb3.
base is a nominal group and mood is finite:This case is selected to realize the relational pro-cesses that express the way of "being" and the exis-tential processes.
Here, the base is a nominal groupthat may be an attribute or an identifier in a nominalsentence or question.
The type of "being" may beintensive, circumstantial, or possessive.
Accordingto its type, the base may take some suffixes uch aslocative and possessive before the formation of theverbal group.
In the generation of a verbal group,we assume that the base is a lexical element, andthe required suffixes or the distinct elements are de-termined by the systemic grammar to express theCiceldi and Korbnaz 168 Generation of Simple Turkish SentencesIIIIIImThe head noun can be a common oun, a propernoun, or a pronpun.
According to this choice, thehead noun is modified by different grammatical func-tions that may be interpreted as the constituents ofthe NP.
The general grammatical functions that ex-pand the head noun can be: determiner which indi-cates whether a subset of the head noun is specificor not, and expresses the numerical features of thehead noun; describer which indicates the subjectiveand objective properties of the head noun; classi-fier which indicates aparticular subclass of the headnoun; qualifiers which indicate the characteristics ofthe head noun in terms of some process in which thehead noun is directly or indirectly involved as a par-ticipant.
Qualifiers may be realized by a participleclause.
These grammatical functions can be dividedinto more specific sub-functions.
The order of thesefunctions in a Turkish noun group is determined bypartial orders among them in the implementation.Although the details of the noun groups in Turkishare not given here, the noun groups are fully imple-mented in our system.2.5 Post-Posi t ional  Group (PP)Post-positional group (PP) has a simple structurethat consists of an NP or infinitive, and a postposi-tion particle in Turkish.
Participles are closed classof words such as gSre (according to), do~-u (to-wards), sonra (after) etc.
A particle cannot refer toany concept but it constructs a relationship betweenthe NP and the other constituents.
Each particlemay enforce the NP in a particular case.2.6 Adverb  Group (AdvG)Adverb group (AdvG) is used in the realizationof several circumstantial functions given in Sec-tion 2.2.3.
The main constituent of an adverb groupis head which is an adverb that gives informationabout when, how, where, or in which circumstancessomething happens.
In an adverb group, there maybe additional modifiers to modify the head adverb.3 System Network  o f  S impleSentenceA system network is a set of systems uch that eachsystem is described as "a set of linguistic hoices in aspecific linguistic context" by Firth (Patten, 1988).In addition, the system network displays the graph-ical organization of the grammar.
In the generationwith SFG, the system network (shown in Figure 1)is traversed from left to right by selecting a featurefrom each system, and executing the realization rulesattached to this feature (Matthiessen and Bateman,1991; Patten, 1988).
If the selected feature has afunction that is realized by one of the grammati-cal units in the rank scale, the systemic network isre-entered, and recursively traversed for the gener-ation of that unit.
After traversing the entire sys-tern network, generations of the grammatical unitsare completed.
In this way, the whole sentence thatconsists of these grammatical units is generated.
InFigure 1.a, if we select he simple clause feature fromthe rank system, we enter five more systems: process,transivity, mood, voice and circums~antials.
Afterselecting proper features from these systems, SFGintroduces the process as a function of the clause,and then realizes it as a verbal group by re-enteringthe network.
The selection of a feature from eachsystem, and the representation f realization rulesdepend on the implementation formalism.
These is-sues are considered in Section 4.The required systems, the realization rules, andthe appropriate context of each system in the linguis-tic description of the simple sentence are determinedand organized by using the analysis described in theprevious ection.
As a result, the system networkgiven in Figure 1 is constructed.
In the network, onlysystems and their appropriate contexts are displayedto express the basic linguistic description of simplesentences.
Because of this simplification, more spe-cific rules and relations are not displayed in the net-work.
However, they are considered and handled inthe implementation.To generate a simple sentence, the system net-work is traversed by using the algorithm givenabove.
For example, to produce the simple sentenceaxkada?laz':lax:t sevebilmelisin given in (8.a), af-ter the appropriate f atures are selected, we re-enterthe system network to realize the process by a ver-bal group and to realize the phenomenon by a noungroup.
When the system network is re-entered torealize the process the following systems are en-tered and the appropriate features are selected inFigure 1.b: Enter type-of-base, select verb; entermood, select finite; enter polarity, select positive;enter desc-verb, select potential; enter interrogative,select none.
According to these selected features,the other systems are entered and so on.
At the end,the system FINIT~-VG-I~0H-VF2~ is entered to re-alize the verbal group by using the given structurein Table 2.4 Imp lementat ionIn order to develop a text generator with thesystemic-functional grammar, we need to implementthe linguistic descriptions (system networks and re-alization rules) in a computational environment.
Forthis purpose, we use the FUF text generation sys-tem(Elhadad, 1993) including its functional unifica-tion grammar (FUG) and typed feature formalisms.In this section, we present a brief overview of thegeneration i  FUF, and then, we particularly con-sider t-he generation of simple sentences.The FUF text generation system consists of twomain modules: a unifier and a linearizer (Elhadad,1990-2).

Af-ter the unification process, the lineariser takes thegenerated syntactic description as input, and thenproduces the morphological description of the text.The morphology unit produces the worded text byusing this morphological description (Oflazer, 1993).We assume that an application program that is notincluded in our implementation produces the lezical-ized semantic description of the text.
Consequently,the final text generation system can be organized asshown in Figure 2.In FUG framework, a data structure called func-tional description (FD) is handled.
A FD is a list ofpairs.
Each pair has an attribute name and value.Since we use the FUG formalism in our implemen-tation, we need to translate the system network intothis formalism.
A system in the system network canbe translated into disjunction of FDs, where each FDcorresponds to an alternative in that system (Ko-rkmaz, 1996; Kasper, 1988; Kumano et al, 1994).Realization rules and relations between systems arealso translated into attribute-value pairs.
This pro-cess is described by Kasper as an algorithm thattranslates SFG into FUG (Kasper, 1988).
In ad-dition, FUF provides a typed feature formalism toimplement the mutual exclusion, and hierarchical re-lations in SFG (Elhadad, 1990-1).By using these formalisms, we have designed andimplemented a single sentence generator with SFG.For this purpose, we have designed a Turkish gram-mar for simple sentences in the FUG formalism, andwe have made the required changes in the linearizerof the FUF text generation system in order to handleTurkish morphology.The lexicalized semantic representation f a sen-tence must contain the required functions for thatrThese new inputs axe produced and recursively per-formed by the unifier.sentence.
If a function does not appear in the inputset but it is required, the first alternative is selectedas a default value for that function.
The followingsimple sentence is generated by the system imple-mented in FUF: sExample:(13) dun Ali Veli-'ye okul-da mektub-udikkatlice yas-dlra-ma-yabil-ir-di.yesterday Ali Veli+DAT school+Lo?

To realize this sys-tem, we need to develop a large Turkish grammarbased on systemic-functional theory, and to imple-ment it in the computational environment.
Thegrammar can be divided into small parts as shownin the rank scale.
Then, each part may be devel-oped independently.
The most important part ofthe grammar is the simple sentence that realizes theseveral semantic functions.
So, at the beginning,we have considered the most common grammaticalstructures of Turkish and their implementation inFUF.
The other parts of the grammar such as com-plex sentences, and the overall generation systemincluding an application program that maps inter-lingua representations of sentences onto their lexi-calized semantic representations are currently underdevelopment.The ultimate generation system will take as inputthe semantic description of a sentence from an appli-cation program, and produce the worded text.
Thesemantic description consists of three metafunctions:ideational such as agent, actor, goal, process, loca-tion for representing the constituents ofthe sentenceand their roles; interpersonal such as mood, modalityfor establishing the relationship between the speakerand the listener; and teztual such as topic, focus,background for presenting information as text in con-text.
The systemic-functional grammar will provideus with useful mechanisms to organize and realizethe linguistic resources.Re ferencesT.
