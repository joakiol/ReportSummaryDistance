Proceedings of the EACL 2012 Workshop on Computational Models of Language Acquisition and Loss, page 19,Avignon, France, April 24 2012. c?2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsProbabilistic Models of Grammar AcquisitionMark SteedmanUniversity of Edinburghsteedman@inf.ed.ac.ukThe most convincing models of human grammar acquisition to date are supervised, in the sensethat they learn from pairs of strings and meaning representations (Siskind, 1996; Villavicencio, 2002;Villavicencio, 2011; Buttery, 2004; Buttery, 2006; Kwiatkowski et al, 2012).
Although the principlesby which such models learn are quite general, the datasets they have been applied to have unavoidablybeen somewhat target-language-specific, and are also limited to discourse-external world-state-relatedcontent, contrary to the observations of (Tomasello, 2001) concerning the central role of commonground and grounding in interpersonal interaction.I?ll review the state of the art in the light of these limitations on the datasets, and try to make somesuggestions about how we might obtain more realistic and challenging artificial and natural datasetsusing both automatic and human labeling methods.ReferencesPaula Buttery.
