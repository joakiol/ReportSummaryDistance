When we expect  a computer  to recogn ize  ob jec ts ,  thelode ls  of them ~must be g iven  to  i t ,  however there  are  caseswhere some ob jec ts  may not  be ,matchedto  the  models  or there  isno model  w i th  which ob jec t  is  compared.
At that  t ime,  th i ssys tem can augment o r  c reate  new descr ip t ions  by be ingexp l i c i t l y  taught  us ing  verba l  ins t ruc t ions .1.
IntrodUctionWe have repor ted  the  s tory  unders tand ing  sys tem which uses  bothl ingu is t i c  and p ic tor ia l l in fo rmat ion  in o rder  to,  reso lve  the  meaningof  g iven isentences  and images.
In th i s  research ,  we have be l ieve  thata cor rec t  meaning of the  g iven  sentences  is  obta ined  i f  the  re la t ionsamong noun .phrases ,  which cor respond I to ob jec ts  in the  images,cons is tent  w i th  the  re la t ions  observed  among ob jec ts  in the  images.The J fac t  that  th i s  ident i f i ca t ion  : of  ob jec ts  and thein terpreta t ion  ~:of the  g iven  sentences  supp lements  each o thers imp l i f ies  both  the  detect ion  of ob jec ts  and d i samib iguat ion  of wordsense  or p repos i t iona l  g roups .
In Sp i te  of these  e f fec ts ,  th i sfo r la l i sn  has a de fect  that  i t  requ i res  add i t iona l  knowledge  sources ,the  model of ob jec ts  that  w i l l  appear  inpthe  images.
Al l  of models  ofob jec ts  or ac tors  that  a re  supposed to appear  in, the  p ic ture  must beg iven  to our sys tem in o rder  to ach ieve  i t s  purposes .
But i t  i s  noteasy fo r  us to s to re  a l l  of  such models  in a computer .

To makemat ters  worse ,  there ,  a re  qu i te  many var ia t ions  in rea l  ob jec ts  wh ichwe w i l l .

For example ,we can see var ioustype  of houses .
~:In the  t rad i t iona l  AI sys tem,  :a gener ic  model isu t i l i zed J  to ident i fy  such c lass  of ob jec ts .
But i t  is  not  easy  forsuch a sys tem to d i sc r iminate  id iosyncrasy  of varous  ob jec ts ,  i F ig .

Even i f  the  sys tem is  supposed to be g ivena gener ic  model ( fo r  example,  BOGLE) that  represents  both  OBAQ andOJIRO, the  sys tem wi l l  not  be ab le  to d i sc r iminate  them.
The sys temneeds  some ,p roper  model fo r  0BAQ and OJIRO.
But i f  a new characterwhich has some s imi la r  po in ts  to;0BAQ and OJIR0 apperes  in the  s tory ,some mod i f i ca t ions l  to the  BOGLE model a re  requ i red .
,  Thusgenera l i za t ion  process  cou ld  not  be acompl i sed  in advance ,  but  shou ldbe ach ieved  through exper iance .When, we are  asked to do some task ,  we are  usua l ly  g ivenin fo rmat ions  concern ing  to  the  ob jec ts  of that  task  and ~the i rp rocess ing  method.
In case  where we encounter  some~unkown ob jec ts  ~nthe  course  of the  taskL we can const ruct  aJ more gener ic  ,modelinc lud ing  them ~together  w i th  a ,e reat ion  of ins tance  models  fo r  thoseind iv idua ls  by d~manding an exp lanat ion  to a person  who knows wel labout those  ob jec ts .
In th i s~rea l  s i tuat ion ,  i t  cannot  be expectedthat  a learn ing  process  proceeds  success fu l ly  l i ke  the  exper iments tud ied  :by Winston ,  as the  assumpt ion  fa i l s  of success  that  thesamples  can be ar ranged conven ient ly  fo r  the  learn ing .
We usua l lyaugment our  knowledge by exp l i c i t l y  be ing  taught  about miss ing  orinsu f f i c ient  par ts  of the  known mode ls .In o rder  to rea l i ze  th i s  type of learn ing ,  there  are  two impor tantp rob lems to be so lved .

ExampleWe would llke to explain how the dialog shown in 5. has beenobtained.
By (I~ the program generate OIJRO model from OBAQ modelshown in Fig.3:~ and constructs a frame tree consisting from a BOGLEframe and the OBAQ frame, is stored as an instance of the BOGLE frame.But it records~in its STM thatlthere is just one hair as the teachersaid so.
Next, C~looks for a candidate region of OJIRO using thecopied model.
In.the second frame, OBAQ, TABLE, APPLE, CLOCK and OJIROare drawn, but as the first four,objects have been appeared in thefirst frame, in this case C can find OJIRO by looking for new objects.But regrettably a color of the region (yellow) which seems to beOJ-IRO'S.
body(J-BODY) being different from that of the model(white),this cause a complaint shown in (2) and by accepting a T's agreement Ccan believe its correctness and T can also think C in a right state.Consequently, C changes value of C0L in J-BODY into YELLOW.Next~ C t r ies  a ver i f i ca t ion io f  J-HAIR which  i s  the  ~f i r s t  memberof  Scots'r; where  Scou'r={J-HAIR,J-HAND}As C can be aware of the  fac t  that  J-HAIR i s  a ha i r  by i t s  AK0s lo t  and that  there  i s  a note  on the  ha i r  in  STM, i t  can know that0 J IR0 'S  ~ha i r  cannot  be recogn ized  on ly  by re fe r r ing~to  the  cop iedmode l .
S ince  the  jus t  one a l te ra t ion  in  the  number of ha i r s  i srecordedf  there , ,  C th inks  the i r  l ocat ion  to  be same as t l~  modelspec i f i ca t ion ,  end can f ind  a l ine  in  the  ((C)U) par t  of J -B0bY.
I tends  the  ve~f f i ca t ion  of J-HAIR by s to r ing  (H1 NIL) .
in to  SUBB ~lor  iop lace  o f : (L1  NIL L2 NIL L3 NIL) .
In a s imi la r  ~ay to th i s ,  C beg ins  toA LEARNING OF OBJECT STRUCTURES BY VERBALISMident i fy  J-HAND, however C can be aware of that  i t  shou ld  10ok forJ-R-HAND and J-L-HAND, as ~here is  a CONCEPT s lo t  in J-HAND.
So Csucceeds  in the  ident i f i ca t ion*o f  them~because .o f  a per fec t  match inthe i r  locat ions ,  co lo rs  and subst ructureS .The resu l t  of  th i s  s teps  is  repor ted  in (3 ) .
Next , .
theident i f i ca t ion  process  proceeds  to Sin and C s tar ts  a ver i f i ca t ion  ofJ-MOUTH,~where SIxffi(J-MOUTH, J -EYE).
As the  locat iona l  const ra in t  fo rth i s  par t  i s  ( ( ** )C) ,  which means that  i t  occup ies  ( (L )C) ,  ( (C) ,C)  and( (R) ,C)  of J-BODY, the  check  is  a t tempted  whether  jus t  one cand idatecan be found fo r  each o f .
these  3 subreg ions .
In th i s  case ,  noth ing  i sfound for  ( (L )C) land  ((R)C) but  severa l  par ts  a re  found in ((C)C) ofJ-BODY.
So th i s  p rocess  i s  suspende d and ident i f i ca t ion  of o therpar ts  (J~R-EYE and J-L-EYE) i s  a t tempted ,  but  the  same ambigu i ty  asthe  above occurs  and th i s  causes  the  ident i f i ca t ion  s teps  to besuspended.
Consequent ly ,  fo r  each one of these  3 par ts , , the i r  resu l t sa re  jus t  same ~each o ther ;  there  are  3~par ts  in the  ( (C)C)o f  J-BODYand they la re  cand iades  fo r  J-MOUTH, J-R-EYE and J-L-EYE.
Then Cava i l s  of the  re la t iona l  const ra in t  on i locat ions  of them in o rder  toc la r i fy  the i r  cor respondences  as fa r  as .poss ib le .
I t  in fe rs ,  thatJ-MOUTH ,probab ly  locates  in a lower pos i t ion  than  J-EYE, because  thelocat ion*o f  J-MOUTH is  ( ( ** )C)  and that  o f  J-R-EYE and J-L-EYE is((L)U) and ((R)Ut respect ive ly  ( in  th i s  example note  that  the  locat ionof J-EYE, ( ( ** )U)  can be a l so  ava i lab le )~ And i t  i s  a l so .dec idab le  i fwhich b lack  reg ion  cor responds  to J -L(R)-EYE us ing ,  the  re la t ionbetween ((L)U) and ( (R)Ut .
By th i s  assumpt ion  on ava i lab i l ty  of there la t iona l  const ra in ts ,  C can d i scover  one poss ib le  cor respondencebetween the  model and ob jec t .
Then o ther  p roper t ies  a re  tes ted :  Butregret tab ly ,  d i sc repanc ies  a re  found fo r  both  h i s  mouth and eyes .
Thecand idate  fo r  h i s  mouth is  a l ine  segment ,  whereas  the  model says  thati t  i s  a reg ion  and that  i t  has a subst ructure .
S imi la ry  the  cand idatefo r  h i s  le f t ( r ight )  eye is  a b lack  reg ion ,but  i t s  model descr ip t ion  isthat  i t  i s  a whi te  reg ion  w i th .
a subst ructure .
.
At the  present .
s ta teof program,  any es t imat ion  on which i s  more p laus ib le  i s .not  rea l i zedregard ing  to the  accordance  of these  proper t ies ,  C s imply  compla insabout the i r  d i sagreements  in the  order  of the i r  d i scovery .There fore  i t  at f i r s t  compla ins  of h i s  mouth as shown in (4 ) .Given teacher*s  ins t ruc t ion  on a. shape of mouth,  C i s  conv inced  of h i sdec is ion  and add a new s lo t  SUBB in p lac  e of SUBP and records  (H~ NIL)in to  i t  becase  i t  has found that  h i s  mouth i s  not  a reg ion  but  a l inesegment .
Here ins tead  of the  ins t ruc t ion J (9 ) ,  T can say that  C shou ldbe be l ieve  the  g iven  image cor rec t .
In that  case ,  C suppose  i t sdec is ion  to  be r ight  and does the  same th ing  as  the  above .
Thed i f fe rence  between these  two cases  is  that  the  la t te r  has a h igh  r i skin the  cor rec tness  of i t s  conc lus ion .Next,  C compla ins  about  the  d i sc repanc ies  of h i s  eyes .
Note herethat  noth ing  is  s ta ted ,  about h i s  le f t -eye  oncean ins t ruc t ion  on h i sr ight -eye  is  g iven  to  i t ,  because  they have the  same proper t iesconcern ing  to both  the i r  models  and ob jec t  par ts .
In case  where oneof them i s  not  same, a quest ion  is  asked:about  the  d i f fe rence  by:C.T.

At p resent  our program ~ust makes frame, t rees  in which OJIROand OBAQ frame are  ch i ld  of BOGLE.A reason  fo r  th i s~ is  par t ly  due to a lack of conds iderat ion  hows imple  p ic tor ia l idescr ip t ions  can be compi led  from var ious  types  ofdev ia t ions  in s lo t  va lues .
An another  reason  i s  that  there  is  adanger  of par t ia l  rear rangements  of f rames t rees~ In the  example ,  weat  f i r s t  be l ieve  OBAQiframe to be an ins tance ,  frame but i t  may turnout that i i t  i s  not  an ins tance  when other  examples not  mat.ched to th i sframe appears  in : image,  because  there  are  many var ie t ions  in h i s  shapeas he can wink or move h is  eyes  or open h is  mouth.
