Resources for Urdu Language ProcessingSarmad HussainCenter for Research in Urdu Language ProcessingNational University of Computer and Emerging SciencesB Block, Faisal Town, Lahore, Pakistansarmad.hussain@nu.edu.pkAbstractUrdu is spoken by more than 100 millionspeakers.
This paper summarizes the cor-pus and lexical resources being developedfor Urdu by the CRULP, in Pakistan.1 IntroductionUrdu is the national language of Pakistan and oneof the state languages of India and has more than60 million first language speakers and more than100 million total speakers in more than 20 coun-tries (Gordon 2005) .
Urdu is written in Nastaliquewriting style based on Perso-Arabic script.
Thispaper focuses on the Urdu resources being devel-oped, which can be used for research in computa-tional linguistics.2 Urdu Text EncodingUrdu computing started early, in 1980s, creatingmultiple encodings, as a standard encoding schemewas missing at that time.
With the advent of Uni-code in early 1990s, some online publications haveswitched to Unicode, but much of the publicationstill continues to follow the ad hoc encodings(Hussain et al 2006).
Two main on-line sourcesof Urdu text in Unicode are Jang News(www.Jang.net/Urdu) and BBC Urdu service(www.BBC.co.uk/Urdu) and are thus good sourcesof corpus.
Encoding conversion may be required ifdata is acquired from other sources.3 CorporaEMILLE Project, initiated by Lancaster Univer-sity is one of the first initiatives to make Urdu cor-pus available for research and development of lan-guage processing (McEnery et al 2000).
The pro-ject has released 200,000 words of English texttranslated into Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabiand Urdu, creating a parallel corpus across theselanguages.
In addition, the corpus also has512,000 words of Spoken Urdu, from BBC Radio.Moreover, the corpus also contains 1,640,000words of Urdu text.
These Urdu corpus resourcesare also annotated with a large morpho-syntactictag-set (Hardie 2003).Center for Research in Urdu Language Process-ing (CRULP) at National University of Computerand Emerging Sciences in Pakistan has also beendeveloping corpora and associated tools for Urdu.A recent project collected a raw corpus of 19 mil-lion words of Urdu text mostly from Jang News,reduced to 18 million words after cleaning.
Thecorpus collection has been based on LC-STAR IIguidelines1.
The domain-wise figures are given inTable 1.
Further details of the corpus and associ-ated information are discussed by Ijaz et al (2007).Table 1: Distribution of Urdu CorpusCleaned CorpusDomains TotalWordsDistinctWordsC1.

However, due to distributionrestrictions in this agreement, the corpus has notbeen made publicly available.
The distributionrights are still being negotiated with Jang News.The tag set developed by Hardie (2003) is basedon morpho-syntactic analysis.
A (much reduced)syntactic tag set has also been developed by1 See www.lc-star.org/docs/LC-STAR_D1.1_v1.3.docThe 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 200899CRULP (on the lines of PENN Treebank tagset),available at its website www.CRULP.org.
A cor-pus of 100,000 words manually tagged on this tagset has also been developed based on text fromJang online news service.
This CRULP POSTagged Jang News Corpus is available through thecenter.Recently another corpus of about 40,000 wordsannotated with Named Entity tags was also madeavailable for Workshop on NER for South andSouth East Asian Languages organized at IJCNLP2008.
The annotated corpus was donated byCRULP and IIIT Hyderabad and is available athttp://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-08/index.cgi?topic=5.Tag set contains 12 tags.
Details of these tags arediscussed at the link http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-08/index.cgi?topic=3.
The CRULP portion of thedata is also available at CRULP website, and is asubset of the CRULP POS Tagged Jang NewsCorpus.In earlier work at CRULP, a 230 spelling errorscorpus has also been developed based on typo-graphical errors in Newspapers and student termpapers.
See Naseem et al (2007) for details.A corpus of Urdu Names has also been devel-oped by CRULP, based on the collective telephonedirectories of Pakistan Telecommunications Cor-poration Limited (PTCL) from across all majorcities of Pakistan.
A name list has also been ex-tracted from the corpus for all person names, ad-dresses and cities of Pakistan.4 LexicaLexica are as critical for development of languagecomputing as corpora.
One of the mostcomprehensive lexica available for Urdu wasrecently released by CRULP (available throughCRULP website).
The online version, calledOnline Urdu Dictionary (OUD) contains 120,000entries, with 80,000 words annotated withsignificant information.
The data of OUD is XMLtagged, as per the annotation schema discussed byRahman (2005; pp.
15), which contains about 20etymological, phonetic, morphological, syntactic,semantic and other parameters of informationabout a word.
The dictionary also gives translationof 12000 words in English and work is under wayto enable runtime user-defined queries on theavailable XML tags.
The contents of this lexiconare based on the 21 volume Urdu Lughatdeveloped by Urdu Dictionary Board ofGovernment of Pakistan.
See www.crulp.org/oudfor details.CRULP has also developed a corpus based lexi-con of 50,000 words with frequency data and an-notation specifications defined by LC-STAR IIproject (at http://www.lc-star.org/docs/LC-STAR_D1.1_v1.3.doc).
Details of the lexicon an-notation scheme are given by Ijaz et al (2007).There are also additional tools available throughCRULP, and documented at its website, includingnormalization, collations, spell checking, POS tag-ging and word segmentation applications.5 ConclusionsThis paper lists some core linguistic resources ofUrdu, available through CRULP and other sources.However, the paper identifies licensing constraints,a challenge for open distribution, which needs tobe addressed.ReferencesGordon, Raymond G., Jr.
