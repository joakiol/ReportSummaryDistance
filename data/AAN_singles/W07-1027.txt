Thebest classifier achieved an overall F1 valueof 88.2 on a data set of 978 free text clinicalrecords, and was better than the performanceof two out of three human annotators.1 IntroductionDespite the rapid progress on text categorisation inthe newswire domain, assigning meaningful labelsto clinical notes has only recently emerged as a topicfor computational linguists although health infor-matics researchers have been working on the prob-lem for over 10 years.
This paper describes con-structing classifiers for the Computational MedicineCenter?s 2007 Medical Natural Language Process-ing Challenge which aims to assign ICD-9-CMcodes to free text radiology reports.
(ComputationalMedicine Center, 2007) It addresses the difficultiesof medical text categorisation tasks by incorporatingmedical negations, term variations, and clues fromhierarchy of medical ontologies as additional fea-tures.2 The task of assigning ICD-9-CM codesThe corpus used in this study is a collection ofradiology reports from the Cincinnati Children?sHospital Medical Center, Department of Radiol-ogy.
(Computational Medicine Center, 2007) Thedata set is divided into a training set and a test set.The training set consists of 978 records and the testset consists of 976 records and 45 ICD-9-CM code.The task was considered as a multi-label text cate-gorisation problem.
For each code found in the cor-pus, we created a separate classifier which makesbinary ?Yes?
or ?No?
decisions for the target codeof a clinical record.
Maximum Entropy Modeling(MaxEnt) (Berger et al, 1996) and Support VectorMachine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995) were used to buildthe classifiers in our solution.3 FeaturesA variety of features were developed to representwhat we believed were the important determiners ofthe ICD-9-CM codes.Bag-of-words (BOW) features: include only un-igrams and bigrams in the text.Negation features: were used in the classificationsystem to capture the terms that are negated or un-certain, for example ?pneumonia?
vs ?no evidenceof pneumonia?.
We created a negation-finding sys-tem which uses an algorithm similar to (Chapmanet al, 2001) to identify the negation phrase and thescope of negations.Gloss matching feature: The ICD-9-CM pro-vides detailed text definition for each code.

The intuitionis to explore different combination of feature typesquickly instead of doing further feature selectionprocedures.
The system trained on the best combina-tion of feature types are reported as the final resultsfor the target code.Low frequency codes modeling: A rule-basedsystem was also used to model low frequency ICD-9-CM codes which have only one occurrence in thecorpus, or have achieved F1 value of 0.0 by machinelearning.
The system assigns a low frequent code toa clinical record if the content of the record matchesthe words of the code definition.4 ResultTable 1 shows the experiment results.
Since thegold-standard annotation of the test dataset has notbeen released so far, the experiment was done on the978 documents training dataset using 10-fold cross-validation.

Adding negation featuresgives S1 an improvement of 1.9% on F1 score.
Thegloss matching features gives a further increase of1.7% on F1 score.In order to understand more about the ICD-9-CM code assignment task, this section evaluates the1The official score of our system on the test dataset isF1 = 86.76 which was ranked 7th among 44 systems.

We created a classification system whichconsists of multiple machine-learned classifiers onhigh-frequency codes, and a rule-based modelingmodule of low-frequency codes.
By incorporatingnegations and a variety of gloss matching features,we successfully outperformed the baseline with onlybag-of-words features by 7.1% on F1 value.
Thebest reported score is also considered as compara-ble to the performance of the best human annotator.We also consider the way our system selected thebest combination of feature types for each individ-ual ICD-9-CM code has a major contribution to theclassification task of clinical records.ReferencesAdam L.
