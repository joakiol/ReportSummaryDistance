Jana Kazimierza 5, 01-248 Warszawa{adamp,hajnicz,aep,wolinski}@ipipan.waw.plAbstractThe aim of this paper is to propose a far-reaching extension of the phraseological component ofa valence dictionary for Polish.
The dictionary is the basis of two different parsers of Polish; itsformat has been designed so as to maximise the readability of the information it contains and itsre-applicability.
We believe that the extension proposed here follows this approach and, hence,may be an inspiration in the design of valence dictionaries for other languages.1 IntroductionThe starting point of the work reported here is Walenty, a valence dictionary for Polish described inPrzepi?rkowski et al.
2014 and available fromhttp://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/Walenty (see ?1.1).Walenty contains some valence schemata for verbal idioms; e.g., one of the schemata for ku?
?forge?
saysthat it combines with a nominal subject, a nominal object and a prepositional phrase consisting of thepreposition na ?on?
and the accusative singular form of the noun pami??
?memory?
?
this represents theidiom kto?
kuje co?
na pami??
?somebody rote learns something?, lit.
?somebody forges something ontomemory?.
The current formalism handles various kinds of verbal phraseological constructions (cf.
?1.2),but also has clear limitations.
For example, in Polish one may welcome somebody ?with arms wideopen?, and the current formalism makes it possible to express the ?welcome with arms + modifier?
part,but not the specifics of the allowed modifier, namely, that it is the adjective meaning ?open?, possiblyitself modified by an intensifying adverb (cf.
?1.3 for details).The aim of this paper is to propose a new subformalism of Walenty for describing phraseologicalvalence schemata (see ?2).
To the best of our knowledge, Walenty is already rather unique among valencedictionaries for various languages in paying so much attention to phraseological constructions (among itsother rare or unique features), and at the same time it is practically employed in parsing by two differentparsers of Polish (cf.
?1.1).
We believe that these traits make the current proposal to further extend theunderlying formalism potentially interesting to the wider audience.1.1 WalentyWalenty is a valence dictionary which is meant to be both human- and machine-readable; in particular,it is being employed by two parsers of Polish, ?wigra (an implementation of a Definite Clause Grammardescription of fragments of Polish syntax; Woli?ski 2004) and POLFIE (an implementation of a LexicalFunctional Grammar description of fragments of Polish; Patejuk and Przepi?rkowski 2012).
As theseparsers are based on two rather different linguistic approaches, the valence dictionary must be sufficientlyexpressive to accommodate for the needs of both ?
and perhaps other to come.Each verb is assigned a number of valence schemata1and each schema is a set of argument specifica-tions.
Walenty is explicit about what counts as an argument: if two morphosyntactically different phrasesmay occur coordinated in an argument position, they are taken to be different realisations of the sameargument.
This is exemplified in the following schema for t?umaczy?
?explain?, as in Musia?em im t?u-maczy?
najprostsze zasady i dlaczego trzeba je stosowa?

involving a coordinated phrase in the object position consisting ofan NP (najprostsze zasady ?the most basic principles?)
and an interrogative clause (dlaczego trzeba jestosowa?
?why they should be adhered to?
; marked here as cp(int)).subj{np(str)} + obj{np(str); cp(int)} + {np(dat)}There are three argument positions (separated by +) given in this schema: a subject, an object and anadditional argument whose grammatical function is not specified but whose morphosyntactic realisationis described as a dative nominal phrase (np(dat)).
The subject is also described as a nominal phrase(NP), but its case is specified as structural, i.e., potentially depending on the syntactic context.
In Polish,such subjects are normally nominative, but ?
according to some approaches ?
they bear the accusativecase when they are realised as numeral phrases of certain type.
Similarly, the nominal realisation of theobject is specified as structural, as it normally occurs in the accusative, unless it is in the scope of verbalnegation, in which case it bears the genitive.
Crucially, though, the object is specified here not just as anNP, but also alternatively as an interrogative (int) clausal argument (cp, for complementiser phrase).
Aparser may take this information into account and properly analyse a sentence with unlike coordinationlike the one involving t?umaczy?
?explain?, given in the previous paragraph.Other features of the formalism of Walenty worth mentioning here, and described in more detail inPrzepi?rkowski et al.
2014, are: the representation of control and raising (cf.
Landau 2013 and referencestherein), specification of semantically defined arguments (e.g., locative, temporal and manner), with theirpossible morphosyntactic realisations defined externally (once for the whole dictionary), handling ofvarious kinds of pronominal arguments, and other types of non-morphological case specifications (apartfrom the structural case).
While there is no explicit semantic information in the dictionary at the moment(apart from such semantically defined arguments and control information), i.e., no subdivision of verballemmata into senses and no semantic role information, Walenty is currently being extended to includesuch a semantic layer.1.2 Phraseology in WalentyTwo features of the Walenty formalism deal with multi-word expresssions.
The simpler one is concernedwith complex prepositions such as w kwestii ?in (some) matter?, na temat ?on (some) topic?, z powodu?because of?
(lit.
?of reason?
), etc.
Unlike in case of usual prepositional phrases, parameterised with thepreposition lemma and the grammatical case it governs (e.g., prepnp(z,inst) for a prepositionalphrase headed by z ?with?
and taking an instrumental NP), such complex prepositions seem to uniformlygovern the genitive case, so explicit case information is not needed here.
The following schema, forrozpacza?
(z powodu czego?)
?lament (because of something)?, illustrates this type of arguments:subj{np(str)} + {comprepnp(z powodu)}Other, more clearly idiomatic arguments are currently specified as fixed, lexnp and preplexnp.Phrases of type fixed again have just one parameter: the exact orthographic realisation of the phrase;see the following schema for zbi?
?beat?
(as in He beat them to a pulp), with na kwa?ne jab?ko meaningliterally ?into sour apple?
:subj{np(str)} + obj{np(str)} + {fixed(?na kwa?ne jab?ko?
)}A more interesting type is lexnp with four parameters indicating the case of the NP, its grammaticalnumber, the lemma of the head, and the modifiability pattern.
The following schema for p?yn??
?flow?
(as in Hot blood flows in his veins), where the subject is a structurally-cased NP, as usual, but necessarilyheaded by krew ?blood?
in the singular, and the NP may contain modifiers (cf.
atr), illustrates this:subj{lexnp(str,sg,?krew?,atr)} + {preplexnp(w,loc,pl,?
?y?a?,ratr)}The final lexical argument type is preplexnp, which contains an additional (initial) parameter,namely the preposition.
In the above schema, the second argument is a PP headed by the prepositionw ?in?
combining with a locative NP in the plural.
The NP must be headed by ?y?a ?vein?
and mustcontain a possessive modifier (ratr stands for ?required attribute?).
So this schema covers examples84such as Gor?ca krew p?ynie w jego ?y?ach ?Hot blood flows in his veins?, but ?
correctly ?
not the non-phraseological Gor?ca krew p?ynie w ?y?ach (no modifier of ?veins?)
or Gor?ca krew p?ynie w jego ?yle(singular ?vein?
).The third possible value of the modifiability parameter is natr, for lexicalised arguments that cannotinvolve modification.
The following schema for zmarzn??
?get cold, freeze?
handles the idiom zmarzn?
?na ko??
?freeze to the marrow?
(lit.
?freeze to (the) bone?
); note that ko??
?bone?
cannot be modified here,as illustrated by the infelicitous Zmarz?
na go??/tward?
ko??
?
(He) froze to (the) naked/hard bone?
:subj{np(str)} + {preplexnp(na,acc,sg,?ko??
?,natr)}Finally, batr (?bound attribute?
), indicates that the NP must involve a possessive modifier meaning?self?
or ?
(one?s) own?, i.e., a form of either sw?j or w?asny.
For example, zobaczy?
?see?
is involved inan idiom meaning ?to see with one?s own eyes?, as in Na w?asne oczy zobaczy?em jej u?miech i to, ?e nieby?a wcale taka stara ?With my own eyes I saw her smile and that she wasn?t so old at all?
:2subj{np(str)} + {np(str); ncp(str,?e)} +{preplexnp(na,acc,pl,?oko?,batr)}Wewill see below that a more expressive ?
and more general ?
scheme for the representation of phrase-ological valence is needed.1.3 LimitationsA number of problems were identified with the formalism of Walenty as it was described inPrzepi?rkowski et al.
2014 and summarised above.
To start with the simplest cases, it is a simplification tosay that complex prepositions (comprepnp above) are internally unanalysable and always combine withgenitive NPs.
For example, while z powodu ?because of?
cannot occur without any additional dependents,it is sufficient for the nominal form powodu ?reason?
to be modified by an appropriate adjectival form forthe whole expression to be complete, e.g., z tego powodu ?because of this?, lit.
?of this reason?, z wa?negopowodu lit.
?of important reason?, etc.
This is not a general feature of such complex prepositions, though.For example, w trakcie ?during?, lit.
?in (the) course?, must combine with a genitive NP and the nominalform trakcie ?course?
cannot be modified by an adjective (*w tym trakcie lit.
?in this course?
).Second, it is useful for parsers to have more grammatical information about lexically fixed arguments;for example, fixed(?na kwa?ne jab?ko?)
clearly has the internal structure of a prepositionalphrase.Third, the current formalism allows for only two types of phraseological phrases to be specified inmore detail: nominal (lexnp) and prepositional (preplexnp).
While not so frequent, other kindsof idiomatic arguments also occur, including adjectival, adverbial and infinitival.
For example, one ofthe idiomatic uses of mie?
?have?
is mie?
przechlapane ?be in the doghouse, be in deep shit?, lit.
?have(it) screwed?, with an appropriate form of the adjective przechlapany ?screwed?.
Similarly, the verbdysze?
?pant?
may be argued to optionally require the adverb ledwo ?barely?, as in ledwo dysze?
?hardlybreathe?.
Also, k?a??
si?
?lie down?
typically occurs with the infinitival form of spa?
?sleep?.
The currentformalism may describe such requirements only using the rather inflexible fixed notation.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, modification possibilities within phraseological ar-guments are far richer than the four symbols atr, natr, ratr and batr could repre-sent.
One case in point is the idiom already mentioned in ?1, namely, wita?
kogo?
z ot-wartymi ramionami ?welcome somebody with open arms?.
The best representation of the id-iomatic argument realisation z otwartymi ramionami ?with open arms?
is either fixed(?zotwartymi ramionami?)
or preplexnp(z,inst,pl,?rami?
?,atr) or perhapspreplexnp(z,inst,pl,?rami??,ratr).
The first of these does not allow for any modi-fication, so it does not cover z szeroko otwartymi ramionami ?with wide open arms?, etc.
The secondmentions the possibility of modifiers of ramionami (which is the instrumental plural form of the nounrami?
?arm?
), but does not constrain this possibility to (a class of) agreeing adjectives, so it would alsocover the non-phraseological z otwartymi ramionami Tomka ?with Tomek?s open arms?, lit.
?with open2The schema is split into two lines solely for typographic reasons.85arms Tomek.gen?.
Also, it makes such modification optional, while wita?
kogo?
z ramionami ?welcomesomebody with arms?
is at best non-phraseological.
Finally, the third possibility makes modificationobligatory, but the current meaning of ratr is (for good reasons) constrained to possessive modifiers,so it again does not cover the case at hand, where adjectival modification is present.2 Extended phraseological valenceOne more objection against the current subformalism for phraseological arguments, apart from thoseadduced in the preceding subsection, is that it contains some ad hoc notation, whose meaning is nottransparent.
The best examples of this are ratr (a possessive modifier, not just any modifier) and batr(the modifier is a form of sw?j ?self?s?
or w?asny ?own?).
In contrast, we propose a formalism which isnot only more expressive, so as to deal with the limitations mentioned in ?1.3, but also more transparent.As we will see below, the price to pay for this more expressive and principled formalism is that someargument specifications become more complex.2.1 Categories of phraseological argumentsThe first proposed generalisation is to replace category-specific symbols lexnp and preplexnpwith the single lex, whose first parameter indicates the category of the phraseological argu-ment.
For example, the lexnp(str,sg,?krew?,atr) specification given above could be re-placed by lex(np(str),sg,?krew?,atr), and preplexnp(w,loc,pl,?
?y?a?,ratr) ?by lex(prepnp(w,loc),pl,??y?a?,ratr).
Note that the first parameter of lex expressesmore than just the grammatical category of the argument ?
it is the same specification of the morphosyn-tactic realisation ?
here, np(str) and prepnp(w,loc) ?
as used for non-phraseological arguments.Any (non-lexical, i.e., not lex, etc.)
morphosyntactic specification used in Walenty could be used here,including also adjectival, adverbial and infinitival.For example, for mie?
przechlapane ?be in the doghouse, be in deep shit?
mentioned above, wherethe adjective przechlapany must occur in the singular neuter accusative and may be modified by anintensifying adverb (mie?
kompletnie przechlapane lit.
?have (it) completely screwed?
), the appropriateargument realisation could be described as: lex(adjp(acc),n,sg,?przechlapany?,atr).Similarly, the adverb ledwo ?barely?
combining with forms of dysze?
?pant?
could be describedas lex(advp(misc),?ledwo?,natr) (recycling the existing morphosyntactic specificationadvp(misc) for true adverbial phrases), and the infinitival form of spa?
?sleep?
co-occurring withk?a??
si?
?lie down?
?
as lex(infp(imperf),?spa?
?,natr) (again, reusing the standard nota-tion for imperfective infinitival phrases, infp(imperf)).2.2 Modification patternsThe most profound generalisation concerns, however, the specification of modification patterns withinidiomatic arguments.
We propose to retain three basic indicators, namely, natr (no modification possi-ble), atr (modification possible) and ratr (modification required), but ?
in the case of the last two ?additional information must be given specifying the kind of modification that is allowed or required.
Ad-ditionally, atr1 and ratr1 are envisaged as variants of atr and ratr with the additional constraintthat at most one such modifier may be present.3For example, instead of preplexnp(z,inst,pl,?rami?
?,ratr) for z otwartymi ramionami?with open arms?, the following argument specification could be given, explicitly mentioning that the onlypossible modifier of ramionami ?arms?
is an adjectival phrase (and not, say, a genitive modifier):4{lex(prepnp(z,inst),pl,?rami?
?,ratr({adjp(agr)}))}Note that morphosyntactic specifications of possible or required modifiers are enclosed in curly brack-ets, just as in case of direct arguments of verbs, and for the same reason: sometimes multiple morphosyn-tactic realisations are possible and may be coordinated, which indicates that they occupy the same syntac-tic position.
An example of this is the expression komu?
cierpnie sk?ra na my?l o czym?
?something makes3In case of ratr, the obligatoriness of modifier together with this constraint mean that exactly one modifier must occur.4The symbol agr indicates agreeing case here.86somebody?s flesh creep?, lit.
?somebody.dat creeps skin.nom on (the) thought.acc about something.loc?.The argument na my?l o czym?
?on (the) thought of something?
may be realised in at least three ways: as aprepositional phrase as here (prepnp(o,loc)), as a finite clause introduced by the complementiser ?e?that?
(cp(?e); e.g., komu?
cierpnie sk?ra na my?l, ?e (to si?
sta?o) lit.
?somebody.dat creeps skin.nomon (the) thought.acc that (this happened.refl)?
), or as a so-called correlative phrase which shares featuresof the first two realisations, e.g., na my?l o tym, ?e (to si?
sta?o) lit.
?on (the) thought about this.loc that(this happened.refl)?
(prepncp(o,loc,?e)).
Such a disjunctively specified modification possibilitymay be expressed as follows (with the line broken for typographic reasons and indented for readability):{lex(prepnp(na,acc),sg,?my?l?,ratr({prepnp(o,loc);cp(?e);prepncp(o,loc,?e)}))}This specification is still incomplete: the noun my?l may also be modified by an adjectival form, e.g.,the adjectival pronoun t?, as in sk?ra mi cierpnie na t?
my?l ?this thought makes my flesh creep?, lit.
?skin.nom me.dat creeps on this.acc thought.acc?.
This means that adjp(agr) must be added as apossible modifier type.
But the status of this modifier type is different than the three modifier typesgiven above: no two of these three phrases can co-occur unless they are coordinated, but any of themcan co-occur (and cannot be coordinated) with adjp(agr), e.g., sk?ra mi cierpnie na sam?
my?l o tym?the sheer thought makes my flesh creep?, lit.
?skin.nom me.dat creeps on sheer.acc thought.acc aboutthis.loc?.
Hence, the two kinds of modification possibilities are analogous to two different arguments(here, actually, dependents) of a predicate occupying different syntactic positions, and the same notationcould be used to specify them, with the + symbol:{lex(prepnp(na,acc),sg,?my?l?,ratr({prepnp(o,loc);cp(?e);prepncp(o,loc,?e)} + {adjp(agr)}))}Such argument specifications involving lexmay get even more complex due to the fact that lexmayoccur inside modification specifications of another lex, as in the following description of argumentssuch as z otwartymi ramionami ?with open arms?, more accurate than the one given at the beginning ofthis subsection:{lex(prepnp(z,inst),pl,?rami?
?,ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,?otwarty?,natr)}))}Note that lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,?otwarty?,natr) replaces adjp(agr) within ratrand it specifies that not just any agreeing adjective phrase may modify the nominal form r?kami ?arms?,but only the simple adjective phrase consisting of an agreeing form of otwarty ?open?
does.5As discussed above, this is still not a complete description of the range of possibilities here, as theadjective otwartymi ?open?
may itself be modified (contrary to the natr specification above), namely, bythe adverb szeroko ?wide?.
A closer approximation is given below:6{lex(prepnp(z,inst),pl,?rami?
?,ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,?otwarty?,atr({lex(advp(misc),?szeroko?,natr)}))}))}Note that this extension, with the possibility of lex recursion (of the centre-embedding type; Chomsky1959), makes the language of schema specifications properly context-free.2.3 Complex prepositions and fixed argumentsAs noted in ?1.3 above, the notation comprep(...) (e.g., comprepnp(z powodu)) is not suffi-cient to model various combinatory properties of complex prepositions: some of them (e.g., z powodu?because of?)
may combine with a genitive NP or an agreeing adjective phrase, others (e.g., w trakcie?during?)
may only co-occur with an NP, etc.
We propose to reuse the lex notation to describe com-plex prepositions in a more satisfactory manner.
For example, one of valence schemata of umartwia?5Recall that if adjp(...) is the first parameter of lex, the next two indicate gender and number, hence the two agrsafter adjp(agr).6Sporadic examples of z bardzo szeroko otwartymi ramionami ?with arms very wide open?
(note the additional bardzo ?very?
)may be found on the internet, but we draw the line here and do not model such occurrences.87si?
?mortify oneself?, which specifies such a comprepnp(z powodu) argument, could specify it thefollowing way instead (with ?_?
indicating any number here):{lex(prepnp(z,gen),_,?pow?d?,ratr({np(gen);ncp(gen,?e)}+{adjp(agr)}))}In contrast, the requirement of w trakcie (where the noun must be in the singular and adjectival modifi-cation is not possible) could be spelled out this way:{lex(prepnp(w,inst),sg,?trakt?,ratr({np(gen);ncp(gen,?e)}))}As far as we can see, all complex prepositions could be described this way.
On the other hand, thereare cases of fixed arguments which could not be so described simply because they contain formswhich cannot be specified with a reference to a lemma and morphosyntactic categories such as caseor number.
One example is the argument of the form fixed(?d?ba?
), with the form d?ba ?oak.gen?of the noun d?b ?oak?, which co-occurs with forms stan??
?stand?
in the idiomatic expression stan?
?d?ba ?rear?
(of a horse), lit.
?stand oak?.
However, since the form d?ba is not used in contemporaryPolish (the contemporary genitive of d?b is d?bu), this idiomatic argument cannot be expressed aslex(np(gen),sg,?d?b?,natr), as then parsers would try to analyse the non-phraseological (atbest) sequence stan??
d?bu as idiomatic.
Instead, we propose to extend the fixed notation and add a pa-rameter describing the general morphosyntax of such an argument, e.g., fixed(np(gen),?d?ba?
).However, such fixed arguments with forms not attested in contemporary Polish are extremely rareand we envisage that almost all other specifications currently involving fixed can be translated intoperhaps more precise specifications involving lex.
For example, fixed(?na kwa?ne jab?ko?
),used in zbi?
na kwa?ne jab?ko ?beat into a pulp?, literally meaning ?into sour apple?, may be specified asfollows:{lex(prepnp(na,acc),sg,?jab?ko?,ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,?kwa?ny?,natr)}))}2.4 Syntactic sugarThere are two types of syntactic sugar that we would like to propose together with the above extensions.First of all, while it seems that the comprepnp notation for complex prepositions should be replacedby lex, we propose to leave such comprepnp specifications in the dictionary proper and define themin terms of lex specifications separately.
The reason for this is that once a complex preposition occursin the specification of a valence schema, it has the tendency to occur in many schemata; for example,comprepnp(z powodu) occurs in 126 schemata in the March 2014 version of Walenty.
Replacingall these occurrences with the considerably more complex lex specification given above would diminishthe readability of the dictionary.
Instead, comprepnp(?z powodu?)
(perhaps with inverted commas,to increase notational consistency) should be left in particular schemata and it should be defined in termsof lex once for the whole dictionary.7The other kind of abbreviatory notation is best illustrated with idiomatic arguments which have so farrequired the batr modification indicator.
Recall that batr means that a given noun may be modifiedby forms of either of the two adjectives meaning ?self?s, own?, i.e., forms of sw?j and w?asny.
Oneexample is the verb spr?bowa?
?try?, which may combine with the expression swoich/w?asnych si?
?one?spower?
rendering spr?bowa?
swoich/w?asnych si?
w czym?
?try one?s hand at sth?, lit.
?try one?s powers insomething?.
Given the notation introduced so far, this argument would have to be specified as follows:{lex(np(gen),pl,?si?a?,ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,?w?asny?,natr)} +{lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,?sw?j?,natr)}))}This is not only hardly readable, but also misses the generalisation that the two possible modifiers arejust the same kinds of adjectival phrases differing only in the lexical realisation of the adjective meaning?self?s, own?.
We propose abbreviating such specifications as follows, with the use of OR:{lex(np(gen),pl,?si?a?,ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,OR(?w?asny?,?sw?j?
),natr)}))}7This move would be analogous to specifying externally morphosyntactic realisations of semantically defined argumentssuch as xp(locat) or xp(temp) (see Przepi?rkowski et al.
2014 for details).88While we could have reintroduced the batr notation to make this even more readable, this symbol is notused inWalenty uniformly, so it would make sense to replace it with more explicit notation involving lex.In particular, some argument specifications mentioning batr actually allow only for forms of w?asny,not sw?j.
This is, e.g., the case with dor?czy?
?hand (over)?, as in dor?czy?
do r?k w?asnych (but notdor?czy?
do r?k swoich) ?deliver as hand delivery?, lit.
?hand to own hands?, where the specification of therelevant argument in terms of lex explicitly mentions only one of these two adjectives:{lex(prepnp(do,gen),pl,?r?ka?,ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,?w?asny?,natr)}))}Note finally that this shorthand notation is useful not just in cases involving batr in the old formalism.One case in point is the expression co?
strzeli?o komu?
do g?owy ?something came over somebody?, lit.
?something.nom shot sombody.dat to head.gen?, where the form of g?owa ?head?
may be replaced byanalogous forms of other nouns with the samemeaning, including ?eb and ?epetyna, as specified below:8{lex(prepnp(do,gen),sg,XOR(?g?owa?,??eb?,??epetyna?
),atr({adjp(agr)}))}3 Case studyIn the current (as of the end of April 2014) version of Walenty, there are 7 complex prepositions used691 times (in the schemata of 367 different verbs), 17 fixed phrases used 82 times (36 verbs), 177lexnp phrases used 686 times (393 verbs) and 238 preplexnp phrases used 1133 times (496 verbs).The last two contain 1182 natr parameters, 217 ratr parameters, 40 batr parameters and 406 atrparameters.
Summing up, there are 439 different lexicalisations used in 2567 schemata of 659 verbs.This means that the representation of idiomatic schemata is already non-negligible, and it is bound toincrease, as more emphasis is put on such schemata in the current development of Walenty.
Hence, theproposed changes ?
if adopted ?
will involve substantial interference into an existing resource, and mayhave a potentially adverse impact on the development of the lexicon, if the formalism proves to be toodifficult for lexicographers.
This section describes an experiment investigating this issue.We selected 84 schemata of 36 verbs and asked two main lexicographers involved in the developmentof Walenty to rewrite these schemata using the proposed formalism.
The schemata include 38 fixedarguments, 10 comprepnp arguments, 17 lexnp arguments and 28 preplexnp arguments.
The lasttwo contain 22 natr parameters, 6 ratr parameters, 4 batr parameters and 8 atr parameters.
Theschemata were selected manually, taking into account their frequency, diversity of types of lexicalisationsand their parameters, as well as the expected difficulty of rewriting them.
This is the reason for the over-representation of fixed phrases, which need to be completely reanalysed.
We chose multiple schematafor the same verb, to give lexicographers the possibility to join them into a single schemata, given themore expressive new formalism.
In particular, all 12 lexicalised schemata for the verb sta?
?stand?
wereselected for the experiment.The two lexicographers worked on the textual format of the dictionary (cf.
http://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/Walenty) without any support from a tool verifying the syntax of the schemata, etc.
Cor-respondingly, when comparing their results, we ignored purely syntactic errors, including differences inbracketing etc., as such errors can be prevented by such a dedicated tool.After ignoring such trivial differences, 34 of 84 schemata were found to be encoded differently by thetwo lexicographers.
The differences included 3 cases of a wrong lemma, 5 cases of different values ofgrammatical categories of case, number, etc., and 7 differences concerning the introduction of new non-lexicalised arguments or merging schemata on the basis of the coordination criterion mentioned in ?1.1.These differences are not directly connected with the proposed changes of the formalism for lexicalisa-tions.
Moreover, 9 differences concerned using (r)atr instead of (r)atr1 (cf.
?2.2) where a singlerealisation of a modifier is possible, as in the following (correct) argument specification for przemarzn???freeze?
surfacing in przemarzn??
do szpiku ko?ci ?freeze to the bone?, lit.
?freeze to (the) marrow (of)bone(s)?
:8This argument specification uses XOR instead of OR as only one of the lexemes meaning ?head?
may be used at a time,unlike in the previous case, where forms of both sw?j and w?asny could be used simultaneously: spr?bowa?
swoich w?asnychsi?
w czym?
lit.
?try one?s own forces in something?.89{lex(prepnp(do,gen),sg,?szpik?,ratr1({lex(np(gen),pl,?ko??
?,natr)}))}Since ko?cimust appear exactly once, ratr1 instead of ratr should be used here.
Obviously, guidelinesfor lexicographers should emphasise this point.Finally, 17 differences concerned core aspects of the new formalism, such as different modificationpatters (5), the lack of the morphosyntactic type for fixed (3) and an incorrect specification of the mor-phosyntactic type of lex, e.g., lack of aspect of infp (2).
We judged 6 of them as considerably difficultcases of fixed lexicalisations, rewriting of which was not at all obvious.
One such difficulty concernedan idiomatic use of wyj??
?exit?
as in kto?
wyszed?
za kogo?
za m??
?somebody married somebody else?
(of a woman marrying a man, not the other way round), lit.
?somebody.nom exited prep9somebody.accprep husband?.
The problem lies in the za m??
?prep husband?
part, where m??
could be analysed asthe regular nominative, but then it would be unexpected that the preposition za occurs with a nominativenoun (it normally combines with the accusative and the instrumental), or as an idiosyncratic accusativeform only occurring in this idiom, similarly to d?ba mentioned above occurring in stan??
d?ba ?rear?
?in this case the exceptional use of fixed would be justified, even though the use of fixed was ex-plicitly discouraged in this experiment.
The two specifications of the argument za m??
given by the twolexicographers are cited below10.
{fixed(prepnp(za,acc),?za m???)}{lex(prepnp(za,nom),sg,?m??
?,natr)}In summary, we feel that the experiment showed that the new formalism is relatively clear and can belearnt by lexicographers, given some training.
Support provided by a dedicated lexicographic tool shouldreduce the number of errors, especially syntactic inconsistencies.
On the other hand, the experimentconfirmed that some of the most difficult lexicalisations are those currently marked as fixed, and theyclearly require special attention.4 Discussion and conclusionMany valence dictionaries mark some valence schemata as idiomatic ?
this is true, e.g., of the VALBUvalence dictionary for German developed at the Institut f?r Deutsche Sprache (Schumacher et al.
2004;http://hypermedia.ids-mannheim.de/evalbu/), of the VALLEX dictionary of Czech de-veloped at the Charles University in Prague (Lopatkov?
et al.
2006; http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/vallex/), as well as some previous valence dictionaries of Polish, including Pola?ski 1980?1992 andthe dictionary that was used to bootstrap the first version of Walenty, i.e., ?widzi?ski 1998.
However,we are not aware of another valence dictionary that would explicitly describe lexicalised arguments atthe same level of detail as the version of Walenty presented in Przepi?rkowski et al.
2014.
Regardless ofthis level of detail, though, the formalism employed in that version suffers from a number of problemsdiscussed in ?1.3, limiting its ability to describe phraseological constructions precisely.In this paper, we propose a far-reaching extension of the formalism of Walenty, making it possible todescribe the syntactic structure of a lexicalised argument to any necessary depth.
As noted in ?2.2, theproposed extension makes the description language properly context-free, but this does not seem to be aproblem for parsers employing the valence dictionary.
On the contrary, as the parsers of Polish becomemore sophisticated and are developed with full semantic parsing in view, they need precise description ofvalence schemata that makes it possible to reliably distinguish idiomatic arguments from non-idiomaticcompositional constructions.The need for such deeper description of phraseological arguments in valence dictionaries has occa-sionally been expressed in the literature, e.g., by ?abokrtsk?
(2005, 65?66, fn.
20), who notes that ?
[i]ncase of multiword parts of phrasemes, the tree (and not only the sequence of forms) representing this partshould be ideally captured in the lexicon.

This makes us hope that the current proposal will proveinteresting also for the developers of valence lexica for languages other than Polish.9The preposition za has a number of different uses and may be translated as ?behind?, ?for?, ?per?, ?by?, ?as?, etc.10Intuitively, the first representation seems appropriate to us, but we see no strong arguments supporting this intuition.90ReferencesNoam Chomsky.
