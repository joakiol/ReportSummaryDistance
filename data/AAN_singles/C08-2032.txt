Given twobilingual lexicons between language pairsLf?Lpand Lp?Le, we assume these lexi-cons as parallel corpora.
Then, we mergethe extracted two phrase tables into onephrase table between Lfand Le.
Fi-nally, we construct a phrase-based SMTsystem for translating the terms in the lex-icon Lf?Lpinto terms of Leand, ob-tain a new lexicon Lf?Le.
In our experi-ments with Chinese-English and Japanese-English lexicons, our system could cover72.8% of Chinese terms and drastically im-prove the utilization ratio.1 IntroductionThe bilingual lexicon is a crucial resource for mul-tilingual applications in natural language process-ing including machine translation (Brown et al,1990) and cross-lingual information retrieval (Nieet al, 1999).
A number of bilingual lexicons havebeen constructed manually, despite their expensivecompilation costs.
However, it is unrealistic tobuild a bilingual lexicon for every language pair;thus, comprehensible bilingual lexicons are avail-able only for a limited number of language pairs.One of the solutions is to build a bilingual lex-icon of the source language Lfand the target Lethrough a pivot language Lp, when large bilingualc?

Numer-ous researchers have explored the use of pivot lan-guages (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994; Schafer andYarowsky, 2002; Zhang et al, 2005).
This ap-proach is advantageous because we can obtain abilingual lexicon between Leand Lf, even if nobilingual lexicon exists between these languages.Pivot-based methods for dictionary constructionmay produce incorrect translations when the wordweis translated from a word wfby a polysemouspivot word wp1.
Previous work addressed the poly-semy problem in pivot-based methods (Tanaka andUmemura, 1994; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002).Pivot-based methods also suffer from a mismatchproblem, in which a pivot word wpfrom a sourceword wfdoes not exist in the bilingual lexicon Lp?Le2.
Moreover, a bilingual lexicon for technicalterms is prone to include a number of pivot termsthat are not included in another lexicon.This paper proposes a method for building abilingual lexicon through a pivot language by us-ing phrase-based statistical machine translation(SMT) (Koehn et al, 2003).
We build a transla-tion model between Lfand Leby assuming twolexicons Lf?Lpand Lp?Leas parallel corpora, inorder to increase the obtained lexicon size by han-dling multi-word expressions appropriately.
Themain advantage of this method is its ability to in-corporate various translation models that associatelanguages Lf?Le; for example, we can further im-prove the translation model by integrating a smallbilingual lexicon Lf?Le.1A Japanese term ????
: dote, embankment, may be as-sociated with a Chinese term ???,?

?ngha?ng: banking in-stitution, using the pivot word bank in English.2It is impossible to associate two translation pairs (??????
(chikyu?-ondanka),?
global warming), and (global heat-ing, ?????
(qua?nqiu?-bia`nnua?n)?)
because of the differ-ence in English (pivot) terms.127Lf-Lp lexicon Le-Lp lexiconLf-Lp translationphrase tableLe-Lp translationphrase tableLf-Le translationphrase tablePhrase-basedSMT systemWord alignment &grow-diag-final methodMerging phrase tablesAdditionalfeaturesINPUT OUTPUTLe: translations ofLf-Lp lexiconFigure 1: Framework of our approach2 Merging two bilingual lexiconsWe introduce phrase-based SMT for merging thelexicons, in order to improve both the mergedlexicon size and its accuracy.
Recently, severalresearchers proposed the use of the pivot lan-guage for phrase-based SMT (Utiyama and Isa-hara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007).
We employ asimilar approach for obtaining phrase translationswith the translation probabilities by assuming thebilingual lexicons as parallel corpora.
Figure 1 il-lustrates the framework of our approach.Let us suppose that we have two bilingual lex-icons Lf?Lpand Lp?Le.
We obtain word align-ments of these lexicons by applying GIZA++ (Ochand Ney, 2003), and grow-diag-final heuristics(Koehn et al, 2007).
Let w?xbe a phrase thatrepresents a sequence of words in the languageLx.
For phrase pairs (w?p, w?f) and (w?e, w?p), thetranslation probabilities p(w?p|w?f) and p(w?e|w?p)are computed using the maximum likelihood esti-mation from the co-occurrence frequencies, con-sistent with the word alignment in the bilinguallexicons.
We calculate the direct translation prob-abilities between source and target phrases,p(w?e|w?f) =?w?pp(w?e|w?p)p(w?p|w?f)?w??e?w?pp(w??e|w?p)p(w?p|w?f).
(1)We employ the log-linear model of phrase-basedSMT (Och and Ney, 2002) for translating thesource term w?fin the lexicon Lf?Lpinto the tar-get language by finding a term ?w?ethat maximizesthe translation probability,?w?e= argmaxw?ePr(w?e|w?f)= argmaxw?eM?m=1?mhm(w?e, w?f), (2)where we have M feature functions hm(w?e, w?f)and model parameters ?m.In addition to the typical features for the SMTframework, we introduce two features: character-based similarity, and additional bilingual lexicon.We define a character-based similarity feature,hchar sim(w?e, w?f) = 1 ?ED(w?e, w?f)max(w?e, w?f), (3)where ED(x, y) represents a Levenshtein distanceof characters between the two terms x and y3.
Wealso define an additional bilingual lexicon feature,hadd lex(w?e, w?f) =?ilog p?(w?(i)e|w?
(i)f), (4)where w?
(i)eand w?
(i)frepresent an i-th translatedphrase pair on the term pair (w?e, w?f) during thedecoding, and p?(w?(i)e|w?
(i)f) represents the phrasetranslation probabilities derived from the addi-tional lexicon.
The probability p?(w?(i)e|w?
(i)f) is cal-culated using the maximum likelihood estimation.3 Experiment3.1 DataFor building a Chinese-to-Japanese lexicon, weused the Japanese-English lexicon released byJST4 (527,206 term pairs), and the Chinese-English lexicon compiled by Wanfang Data5(525,259 term pairs).
Both cover a wide rangeof named entities and technical terms that maynot be included in an ordinary dictionary.
As anadditional lexicon, we used the Japanese-English-Chinese trilingual lexicon6 (596,967 term pairs)generated from EDR7 Japanese-English lexicon.We lower-cased and tokenized all terms by thefollowing analyzers: JUMAN8 for Japanese, theMEMM-based POS tagger9 for English, and cjma(Nakagawa and Uchimoto, 2007) for Chinese.3.2 The sizes and coverage of merged lexiconsTable 1 shows the distinct numbers of terms inthe original and merged lexicons, and the uti-3We regard the different shapes of Han characters betweenChinese and Japanese as identical in our experiments.4Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)http://pr.jst.go.jp/others/tape.html5http://www.wanfangdata.com/6This data was manually compiled by NICT, Japan.7http://www2.nict.go.jp/r/r312/EDR/index.html8http://nlp.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nl-resource/juman.html9http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/?tsuruoka/postagger/128Lexicon LCsize LEsize LJsizeLC?LE375,990 429,807 -LE?LJ- 418,044 465,563LE(distinct) - 783,414 -Additional lex.

For compari-son, we prepared two baseline systems for build-ing Chinese-Japanese lexicons.
Exact matchingconnects source and target terms that share atleast one common translation term in the pivotlanguage.
Unique matching is an extreme ap-proach for avoiding negative effects of polysemouspivot terms: it connects source and target terms ifsource, pivot, and target terms appear only once inthe corresponding lexicons.Exact matching achieved 26.2% of the utiliza-tion ratio in Japanese-to-Chinese translation, and22.2% in Chinese-to-Japanese translation.
Thesefigures imply that about 75% of the terms remainedunused in building the Japanese-Chinese lexicon.With unique matching, as little as 1% of Japaneseand Chinese terms could be used.
In contrast, ourmethod could cover 72.8% of Chinese terms bygenerating Japanese terms, which was a drastic im-provement in the utilization ratio.3.3 Generating Japanese translations of theChinese-English lexiconFor evaluating the correctness of the merged lex-icons, we assumed the lexicon generated by theunique matching as a development/test set.
Devel-opment and test sets consist of about 2,400 termpairs, respectively.
Next, we input Chinese termsin the development/test set into our system basedon Moses (Koehn et al, 2007), and obtained theJapanese translations.
We evaluated the perfor-mance by using BLEU, NIST, and accuracy mea-sures.
Table 2 shows the evaluation results on thetest set.
Our system could output correct trans-lations for 68.5% of 500 input terms.
The tablealso reports that additional features were effectivein improving the performance.We also conducted another experiment to gen-erate Japanese translations for Chinese terms in-cluded in an external resource.

MRR (meanreciprocal rank) is (1/500)?i(1/ri), where riisthe highest rank of the correct translations for thei-th term.Since the input lexicons are Chinese-Englishterm pairs, their Japanese translations can be gen-erated directly from the English terms by applyingan English-Chinese translation system.
We com-pared our system to an English-Japanese phrase-based SMT system (E-to-J translation), con-structed from the JST Japanese-English lexicon.Table 3 shows that our system outperformed theEnglish-to-Japanese direct translation system.Table 4 displays translation examples.
The firstexample shows that our system could output a cor-rect translation (denoted by [T]); and the E-to-Jsystem failed to translate the source term ([F]),because it could not reorder the source Englishwords and translate the word pubis correctly.
Inthe second example, our system could reproduceChinese characters ???
(fluid)?, but the E-to-Jsystem output a semantically acceptable but awk-ward Japanese term.
In the last example, the wordsegmentation of the source Chinese term was in-correct (????

(lymph)??
is cor-rect).
Thus, our system received an invalid word ????
and could not find a translation for the word.11http://www.eijiro.jp/129English Chinese Japanese (Eijiro) Japanese (C-to-J) Japanese (E-to-J)symphysis pubis ????

Giventwo bilingual lexicons Lf?Lpand Lp?Le, we con-structed a phrase-based SMT system from Lf?Leby merging the lexicons into a phrase translationtable Lf?Le.
The experimental results demon-strated that our method improves the utilization ra-tio of given lexicons drastically.
We also showedthat the pivot approach was more effective than theSMT system that translates from Lpto Ledirectly.The future direction would be to introduce otherresources such as the parallel corpora and otherpivot languages into the SMT system for improv-ing the precision and the coverage of the obtainedlexicon.
We are also planning on evaluating a ma-chine translation system that integrates our model.AcknowledgmentsThis work was partially supported by Grant-in-Aidfor Specially Promoted Research (MEXT, Japan)and Japanese/Chinese Machine Translation Projectin Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Sci-ence and Technology (MEXT, Japan).ReferencesBrown, Peter F., John Cocke, Stephen A.
